        "1... c5 2. Bc4 d6 3. Nf3": "This is simply opening with Sicilian defence.",
        "3... Bd7 4. Nc3 e6 5. O-O a6 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Be7 8. Re1 Nc6 9. Be3 b5": "It seems that the Bishop in the square c4 is somewhat trouble for the opposite side. I can move back the Bishop but I thought first better exchange the Knights at d4 and c6 and then think about the Bishop or getting back the Knight if he still wants to take the Bishop.",
        "10. Nxc6 Bxc6 11. Bd3": "See, a pair of Knights are gone.",
        "11... Rc8 12. a3 Nf6 13. b4 O-O 14. f4 Qc7 15. Bd2 e5 16. h3": "Both sides are trying to attack the other side. Who will succeed? You may better watch..,",
        "16... Ne8 17. Ne2 h6 18. Ng3 Bd7 19. Rc1 f5 20. exf5": "Now pawn to pawn attack. Just an exchange though white pawn advancing and white side got a plus.",
        "20... Nf6 21. c3 Bc6 22. Ne4 d5 23. Nxf6+ Bxf6": "Battle is going and Knights fought bravely so now it is hard to find any.",
        "24. fxe5": "Now pawns start to crawl and...",
        "24... Bxe5 25. Be3 Bh2+": "After the pawns, Bishops thought that would be their time to move... ",
        "26. Kh1 Bg3 27. Rf1 d4 28. Bxd4": "Further I plucked another pawn and also attacking his pawn at g7.",
        "28... Qb7": "See some attack that to my pawn at g2,  making by moving the Queen.",
        "29. Qb3+": "Now, I think better move the Queen and attack the King. White side has better choices of moving their Bishop or the King. I thought he would move the King. Then I would advance the pawn at f5 and get another exchange/s and I would lessen his defenses.",
        "29... Bd5": "See, Bishop... I have to start my other plans. The first thing is nothing but the movement of the Queen remember that my pawn at g2 is in danger.",
        "30. Qc2 Rc7 31. f6": "Now it would be time for some harvest.",
        "31... gxf6 32. Rxf6 Rcf7": "Here I could get rid of the Rook but better give some company to the Rook at f6.",
        "33. Rcf1 Rf7xf6 34. Rxf6 Rxf6 35. Bxf6": "So, got exchanges of the Rooks, leaving the battle for the Queens and Bishops.",
        "35... Bd6 36. c4 bxc4 37. Bxc4 Bf7": "Now I earned an attacking position. So, then why not go with the Queen. But how? ",

        "40... Kd7 41. Bxf7 Qb5": "What a move...\nI think he gave up and he just made a move. Do you see why it is a very bad move?",
        "42. Be8+": "You got it. It is the end of the Queen as well as the game. He resigned and exactly that is what I do when I have such situation. \nI enjoyed this game and I wish better luck for his future games.\nThanks for viewing.\n\n \n                                                  End.
