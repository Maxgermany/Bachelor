A great follow up would then be to defend the e5 pawn with Pd4, but black's pawn at c5 might result in a trade.  But your queen move here is probably better in the long run.",
        "4... d5 5. d4": "Oh, here would have gone with Pe5 instead, because Pxe4 forces you to move your knight, and black wreaks more havoc with Pc5.",
        "5... Nc6 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. Na3 Qf6 8. Nb5": ":)  Going for the king/rook fork.  Nice.",
        "8... Bd6": "Parried.",
        "9. Nxd6+": "...or so black thought.  I don't know how I overlooked that obvious move--good job.  Hope you snag the bishop too.",
        "9... Ke7 10. Nxc8+": "Right on!",
        "10... Raxc8": "Oh!  Oh!  You've got his queen!  Bg5 pins the old biddy against the black king.  Sweet!",
        "11. Bg5": "Righteous!",
        "11... Qxg5": "Yep.  Black is better off trading.",
        "12. Nxg5 f6 13. Qxe6+": "Nice move!  Press your advantage.",
        "13... Kd8": "Oh, now fork the king and rook on the right side.",
        "14. O-O-O": "WTH?  Weren't you listening?  Kf7+ gives you black's rook.  As a bonus you could even force the king out to b6, or pick off the undefended knight at d5 at your leisure.  Yeah, black was right to resign."
