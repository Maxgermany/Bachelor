        "18... exf4 19. Qxf4 Qd6 20. Qh4": "Can't afford to swap Qs - need to stay attacking. This moves sets up an interesting exchange on f6 later",

        "21... Bd7 22. Bh5+": "this starts the real trouble for black. g6 creates problems, Nf7 is also trouble - so perhaps black did the best thing by moving the K",
        "22... Kd8": "I can now see an interesting move - Rxf6. Just need to move the black Q away.",
        "23. Ba3 Qa6 24. d6": "....or block the Q from defending f6",
        "24... cxd6": "I can't make the move yet - the K would escape to c7",
        "25. Rac1 Rc8 26. Rcd1 Qxa4": "?? this pawn swap is trouble for black",
        "27. Bxd6 Nc6 28. Rxf6": "and finally I can make the play - hard to see how black defends this now",
        "28... Ne7": "black agreed."
