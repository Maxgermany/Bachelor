        "7. Nde2": "An uncommon reply, blocking the light bishop. Usually played is Nb3 or Nf3 here.",
        "7... Be6": "Always being cautious to guard the hole on d5 in this opening. ",
        "8. f4": "Probably best, attacking my weak center pawns, and maybe aiming to exploit the hole on d5 by removing the defender (playing f5)",
        "8... Nc6": "An aggressive, rather untested move. ",
        "9. f5": "Probably best, still pressuring the center, harassing the bishop, and working towards exploiting the hole.",
        "9... Bc4 10. Qd2": "Definately not white's best move here.. probably best is Ng3, forcing Bxf1 Rxf1, where white will castle long. ",
        "10... d5": "Taking control of the center, given the opportunity!",
        "11. exd5 Nxd5 12. O-O-O": "A disaster.. White needed to play Nxd5 before castling!",
