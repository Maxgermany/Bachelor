        "6. Nd5": "...and this is the result. Now I couldn't make the Nxd5 move, as, after exd5, my opponent wins a knight for a pawn, also having my pawns on c file doubled. So I was forced to move my bishop either to a5, or to c5.",
        "6... Ba5 7. d3": "my opponent prepares the Bg5, which would be a very powerful move, taking into consideration that my f6 knight which will be pinned is attacked by his d5 knight\r\nHere my score is -0.92",

Probably he was afraid that I would take his bishop and he still wanted to maintain that pawn on the f file, trying to push it forward. even so, the bishop was protected by the knight and my opponent even took my bishop with his knight at 17. g5 Bxe3 18. Nxe3, so this was a pointless move, copying mechanically  my 12th move. as result of this move, I gained tempo and my score was +0.17",

Nc4 Rb5. Now, after the game, this sequence of moves makes sense to me, as I really could gain more pressure on White's King, however, during the game I tend to focus on material advantage and when I saw that after Qh3+ I couldn't capture his Knight, I considered this move to be pointless, not seing the potential check with my knight, but centralizing my pawns was also a good move, which gave me the score of +0.60",
