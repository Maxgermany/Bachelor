        "6. dxc6": "Not the best move. The best was 6.Bf1, followed by black Bg4, 7.f3, Nxd5, 8.Nxf7, Kxf7, and so on.",
        "6... bxc4 7. O-O Bd6 8. d3": "Not the best either. This move allows me to get rid of my weak, and horrible pawn over a useful pawn. Better was Qe2 or Nc3.",
        "8... cxd3 9. Qxd3 O-O": "Castling to safety. Right now, I thought I had a good game going.",
        "10. Nc3 a5": "Trying to maybe make a small attack, Ba6.",
        "11. Nd5": "Well, here is a move that I did not think about much at all.",
        "11... Nxd5": "Well,\"sigh\", I failed. I was on a great winning streak right now, and now this......this..move, made me lose it. Dang!!! I won 17 games in a row!! I'm sad.",
        "12. Qxh7#": "Easily punished me, and I deserve it. Thanks for watching this short game."
