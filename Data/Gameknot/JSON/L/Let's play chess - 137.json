    "moves": {
        "1. Nf3": "I've been experimenting with the King's Indian Attack.  I often get interesting positions, although I've occasionally gotten really lousy positions.  Mostly because I don't know what I'm doing yet.",
        "1... Nc6 2. g3 e5 3. d3": "Played to prevent e4.",
        "3... Nf6 4. Bg2 Bc5 5. O-O d6 6. e4 Bg4 7. c3 h5": "This was a very aggressive move, but I thought it was a good one.  Black signals their intention not to castle Kingside, but to launch a direct attack on White's Kingside.",
        "8. h4 b5": "Now, this didn't make sense to me.  Wouldn't Black want to preserve the Queenside pawn structure for 0-0-0 later?  Or what about some follow-through on the Kingside, like Rg8, Nh7, g5?",
        "9. Bg5": "One drawback of h5 is that it allows this pin.  Bg5 also prevents the advance of the g pawn.",
        "9... b4 10. Qd2 O-O": "Now, this is surprising.  Black decides to castle Kingside after all.  I guess White's Kingside is just as loose.",
        "11. Qc2 bxc3 12. bxc3": "I thought about Nxc3, intending Nd5, but I wasn't keen on allowing Nd4 for Black.  Right now Black's Ns don't have a lot of squares.",
        "12... a5 13. Nbd2 a4 14. Nc4": "Getting my N to a better square in the center.",
        "14... Qd7 15. Bxf6": "Qd7 changes Black's ability to recapture with the Q after Bxf6.  I figured it was worth trading the B to inflict some pawn damage.",
        "15... gxf6 16. Ne3": "This N is headed for d5.",
        "16... Bxe3": "Black, wisely I think, prevents Nd5.",
        "17. fxe3 f5": "Logical play to eliminate the pawn weakness.",
        "18. exf5 Bxf5 19. Ng5": "Since Black's Q is overloaded, this threatens Bxc6 followed by Rxf5.",
        "19... f6 20. Nf3 Ra5": "I wasn't sure about the intent of this move.  Black's best target is probably g3.",
        "21. Qd2 Rf7 22. Ne1 Rg7": "Finally targeting g3.",
        "23. Kh2": "Protecting g3.  And once again threatening Bxc6 followed by Rxf5.",
        "23... Be6 24. Rxf6": "Snatching a hanging pawn.  This also allows the possibility to double heavy pieces on the f file.  Black's K is now fairly vulnerable.",
        "24... Ne7 25. e4": "Preventing Nd5 or Nf5.  Also stops ideas like e4 for Black.",
        "25... d5 26. c4": "Discovered attack on Ra5.",
        "26... Ra6 27. exd5": "Winning the d pawn.  The Be6 is pinned against the hanging Ra6.",
        "27... Qd6 28. Rxe6": "Black resigned here in view of additional material losses."
