        "1. d4": "After learning 1. e4 opening, Now a day i am practicing queens Pawn opening with several variation. So 1. d4",
        "1... d5": "He stuck directly in the center that is ok but little bit unusual for me because when i open with d4 the usual response of maximum player here is Nf6.  ",
        "2. c4": "So i play queens Gambit.",
        "2... c6": "gambit decline and a perfect response with c6. The other option may be defend d5 with Nf6. ",
        "3. Nc3": "I continue developing and putting pressure on d5. ",
        "3... Nf6": "So the he continue developing and defending d5 with Nf6.",

        "5. e3": "With e3 i an now able to develop my lsb but i will be very cautious to loss of tempo in this variation. Particularly, after development of bishop at d3 black just take c4 pawn to force me to regain material equality but lose tempo.  ",

        "17... O-O": "He prefer to secure his king before commencing a tough fight",
        "18. Bd2": "meanwhile, I found this better move, The idea was forcing the queen to retreat after c3-c4",
        "18... Rc4": "But he guess my plan and so Rc4 to block pawn push also threatening me to double the rook.  ",
