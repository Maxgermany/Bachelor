        "11. b4 b6 12. bxa5 bxa5 13. Bd3 Rb8 14. Qc2 Nd5 15. Nxd5 exd5": "Now Black has structural weaknesses--two sets of doubled pawns that will be vulnerable.  Offsetting that is temporary control of the b file.",
        "16. Rab1": "Fighting for the b file immediately.  ",
        "16... Rxb1": "Bb7 might have been slightly better, but the B would have been a lousy piece there.",
        "17. Rxb1 Bh4": "Not sure of the rationale for this move.  Generally, Black would want to avoid trades when behind in material.",
        "18. Nxh4 Qxh4 19. Bxa5 Qf6 20. Bc7 Re8 21. Bd6": "The d6 Bishop now keep the c8 Bishop out of play.  Black is effectively two pieces down.",
