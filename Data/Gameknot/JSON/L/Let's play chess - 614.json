    "moves": {
        "1. e4 Nf6": "Alehine's defense, new to me, boy was I about to get a lesson in how this thing works.",
        "2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Nb6 5. f4": "four-pawn attack - I went this way because I'd rather die fighting then defending.",
        "5... dxe5 6. fxe5 Bf5": "Here comes a great illustration of how a misstep when you're this extended results in a complete filet of my centre",
        "7. Bd3": "Please excuse this move...",
        "7... Qxd4": "And the obviously crushing response",
        "8. Bxf5": "an ill-fated attempt at material recovery.\r\n\r\nIf instead\r\nKnf3...QxB and I'll eventually be down 5 pts instead of 3\r\n\r\nif Kg2...then Be4 and leads to me having half my pieces pinned",
        "8... Qxe5+ 9. Qe2 Qxf5 10. Nf3": "I'm surprised this knight didn't fall into the giant black hole in the centre of the board where my four-pawn attack used to be",
        "10... Nc6 11. O-O Qc5+": "I had I gone first with the bishop to e3 I could have prevented the loss of the P on c4",
        "12. Be3 Qxc4 13. Nc3 Qxe2": "Might as well start trading down and end this quick",
        "14. Nxe2 Nc4": "Another example of me missing a developmental weakness and hamstringing myself.  Also caused by not moving the bishop to e3 before castling",
        "15. Bc1": "And the lackluster result, in hindsight, \r\n\r\nIf instead\r\nBf4, then e5 and I'm still running",
        "15... e5": "Opening up the bishop",
        "16. b3": "Need to move the Knight to effective attack the e pawn, also allows me to capitalize on my poorly placed bishop to make him retreat for once",
        "16... Bc5+ 17. Kh1 Nd6 18. Bb2": "Opening up development and grabbing a diagonal",
        "18... e4": "Remind anyone of the opening?",
        "19. Ng5": "D4 would have been another option but I'm not sure either one gets me anything?",
        "19... O-O 20. Nc3": "clumsily attacking the pawn",
        "20... Bd4 21. Rab1": "rudimentary",
        "21... Bxc3 22. Bxc3": "I don't mind this exchange, I'd prefer to keep the bishop as the board clears",
        "22... h6 23. Nh3 Nb5 24. Bb2 f5": "At this point I am eyeing f4 as a great spot for my knight if I can support with the g and h pawns",
        "25. Rbd1": "Grab an open file now that the bishop is strong - looking to infiltrate to the 7th row because of where his knights are placed",
        "25... Nd6": "blocking",
        "26. Ba3": "looking to win a pawn",
        "26... Rf6": "the knight becomes a central piece of his setup.\r\n\r\nRight now I believe I have a space advantage but I do not know how to use it?",
        "27. Rd5": "A decent tactical move I believe to win myself a pawn",
        "27... Ne7 28. Re5 Re8 29. Nf4": "I think at this point I have done a good job of tying up his pieces but I cannot find a way to capitalize and start winning back material.  At a loss on this point I take up position on f4 as planned.",
        "29... g5": "He (rightly so) attacks right away to prevent my support from g and h arriving.  Again, another example where I should have setup this positional move with support first (such as h4) before making it",
        "30. Nh5": "A more limited position for one of my only remaining assets, but providing an effective block here and preventing a pawn storm",
        "30... Rf7": "The question I begin asking myself here is, is there any way to take advantage of his constricted position to back his king into the corner?",
        "31. Re6 Nd5 32. Rxh6 Ne3 33. Rf2": "My second terrible mistake - really embarrassing.  ",
        "33... Ng4 34. Rg6+ Kh7": "I knew if he made this move I was toast - at this point all I could hope for was a mistake.\r\n\r\nMy first game against Alekhine's defense and my first game against a non-novice.  A few key learnings but nothing really inspiring here.  Thanks for reading though!"
