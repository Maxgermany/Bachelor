        "1. d4": "Back in my teenage/early 20's years I always played 1. e4. (Except when I was goofing around I would play 1. g4). Then I went through a long period in my life when I didn't play at all. A few years ago I started playing computer chess and found that my style has pretty much changed. So I'm bouncing back between 1. d4, 1. b3, and 1. c4. So far my best success has been with 1. b3 actually.",
        "1... e6 2. c4 h6": "Huh?",
        "3. e4 Bb4+ 4. Nc3 Bxc3+": "In too much of a hurry to double white's pawns.",
        "5. bxc3 d6 6. Nf3 b6": "The gameknot analysis computer puts White up by 0.93 here.",
        "7. Bd3 Bb7 8. O-O Nd7 9. Be3": "Probably not best. Maybe Qe2 to keep the option of putting the QB on f4?",
        "9... Ngf6 10. Qc2 e5 11. Rad1 Qe7 12. d5": "After this move, White's advantage has evaporated to 0.08",
        "12... c5": "Judged to be an inaccuracy by the computer, which gives  \u2026 Ng4 13. Bd2 Nc5.",
        "13. Nh4 Nxd5": "I had been so engrossed with noticing that ... Nxe4 doesn't work that I didn't even consider this obvious move! Nevertheless the computer calls it an inaccuracy, giving this line instead: \u2026 Ng4 14. Nf5 Nxe3 15. fxe3 Qf8 16. Rf3 O-O-O 17. Qa4 g6 18. Ng3 Kb8 19. Qb5 a6 20. Qb3 Rc8 21. a4 Qe7 22. Rf2. That would have been an interesting game!",
        "14. Nf5 Nxe3 15. fxe3 Qf8 16. Be2 O-O-O": "... d5 was necessary.",
        "17. Nxd6+ Kb8": "... Kc7 was better.",
        "18. Nxf7": "This move seemed so obvious to me that I missed the better Rxf7, Qg8, 19. Qa4!",
        "18... Qe7 19. Nxh8 Rxh8 20. Qd3 Rd8": "A mistake. The computer gives \u2026 Nf6 21. Bf3 Qe6 22. Rd2 Ba6 23. Be2 Bb7 24. a4 Nxe4 25. Rdd1 Bc6 26. Bf3 Qg6 27. Rf2 h5 28. Bxe4 Qxe4 29. Qd6+ Ka8",
        "21. Qd6+ Qxd6 22. Rxd6 Bc8": "The computer gives \u2026 Bxe4 23. Bg4 Kc7 24. Rfd1 Bc6 25. Rg6 Ba4 26. Rf1 Rg8 27. Rf7 e4 28. Be6 Rd8 29. Rgxg7 h5 30. Bd5 Bc2 31. Rh7 Bb1 as Black's best line",
        "23. Bg4 Kc7 24. Rfd1": "Computer calls this a mistake and gives Rg6 as best (see next note)",
        "24... Rf8": "The computer gives \u2026 Nf6 25. Rxd8 Bxg4 26. R1d6 Nxe4 27. Rd3 Nf6 28. Ra8 Kb7 29. Rh8 Be6 30. Rd2 Bxc4 31. Rf8 a6 32. Rfd8 Ne4 33. R2d7+ Kc6 34. Rxg7 Bxa2. Instead of 26. R1d6 I had been planning to play R1d3. Black's actual move loses quickly.",
        "25. Bxd7 Bxd7 26. Rd6xd7+ Kb8 27. Rxg7": "Black tosses in the towel here. A game with plenty of mistakes on both sides. I thought it was fun because I've never had a pawn structure quite like this one!"
