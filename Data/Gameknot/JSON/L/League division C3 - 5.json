        "6. O-O Bb7 7. c4 Nbd7": "The knight would be probably more active in c6. Nbd7 is a good move if the knight can be rerouted to b6.",

        "11. Qe2 Ng4": "This unjustified move looses on the spot due to the weakness of the e-file. 11. ... 00 12. Rac1 dxc4 13. bxc4 Re8 14. Rfe1 would have been playable.",
