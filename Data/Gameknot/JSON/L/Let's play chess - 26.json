    "moves": {
        "1. Nf3": "i started with Nf3 which most players are not prepared.The Reti/Zukertort opening is a solid opening but myself im a catalan player",
        "1... d5 2. g3 e6 3. Bg2": "In this stage ,the plan is to quickly castle and c4 ,d4,Qc2 .Kramnik is a powerful house on this plan",
        "3... Nf6 4. O-O Nc6 5. d4 h6": "a6 for black is a waste move that increase my tempo.Be7 is the recommended move",
        "6. c4 dxc4 7. Nc3 a6 8. a4": "More of a queen gambit accepted.Black is loosing tempo development and has not castled yet",
        "8... Bd7 9. e4 Bb4 10. Qe2 Na5": "Trying to defend this c4 pawn is a weak strategic move ",
        "11. Ne5": "The only move that utilize the Catalan bishop on g2 diagonal ",
        "11... Nb3 12. Qxc4": "Engine suggest Qxc4.The night can be recaptured.Trying to save it is a worst of time.White has a q on a central square plus an advantage even if the rook can be  exchanged for a bishop ",
        "12... Nxa1 13. Qxb4 Nc2 14. Qc4 O-O 15. Nxd7": "White removes the bishop pair preparing for endgame.The bishop pair is a netting mate in the long run.The night is trapped",

        "17... b5 18. Qc3 bxa4 19. Rxa1 Rab8": "Black has a good position but with a lost counterplay. Doubled pawns and disjointed pawn structure and lost centre.Offcourse he has a open Rook diagonal with two pairs of rook .lets see whether he is activate them or not",
        "20. Bh3": "I saw another game with Kaparov in the Kasparov immortal and some Carlsen games .White has a plan of d4 push.From a tactical point of view. saw Bxh6 ahead but could not galvanise and mobilise my pieces.Only Time would tell.I was a piece up anyway .Nxe4 was coming.I had made a mistake or I was overconfident im not sure",
        "20... Nxe4 21. Qc2 Nd6 22. Rxa4 Ne4": "The mistake my opponent did here is violating chess rules.The Knight is played thrice .f5 was supposed to have been played.You will see how it costed him later",
        "23. Rxa6 Nd6": "Another 4th Knight move.The mistake we do when we are playing 30 games is that we tend to want to increase our rating at once.I play 10-15 games at a time and focus.Black seems to be distracted.You know online games are like that",
        "24. Ra5 Nb5 25. Qd2 Qc6": "After Qd2 I saw that exchange Bxh6 but was hesitant.I decided to bring the bishop in g2 diagonal aiming Be5 latter in the game ",
        "26. Bg2 Qb6 27. b4": "The rook is glued and fully supported on a5.I also saw the shifting of the rook to h4 after Bxh6",
        "27... Rbd8 28. Bxh6": "Here it comes i could not wait Bxh6!!.In my plans i expected fxh6 and Qxh6 followed by Be5 followed by Nf4 to exchange it for a mate on h2.In chess you must wait a lot.Chess teaches us to be patient ",
        "28... Nxd4": "After Nxd4 I miscalculated .I was tempted to bring the rook and and lost Nf3+ by black Open check and Queen gone",
        "29. Rg5": "Rg5 ? Nf3 was coming but i saw that Q was a good sacrifice",
        "29... Nf3+ 30. Bxf3 Rxd2": "30...Rd2 was obvious of a mistake but the network and net of moves to a boggling mate .In this position 31.Rxg7 seemed good Kh8  and Be4 would be blocked with f5 for a mate Rh7 i anticipated.After calculating i saw Bxh7 a batter move.Psychologically  i knew Black was satisfied with the queen grab",
        "31. Bxg7 Rd1+": "At this position this is what i saw after much concentration.If i would do open check to Bf6+ i would have solved f5.This was a discovery  got excited with.I also knew black was putting his Q in a white square to avoid discovered check",
        "32. Kg2 Qa6": "The Black queen  is safe from the rook in dark squares.So why worry after all .The queen is  grabbed",
        "33. Bf6+ Kh7 34. Be4+": "At this position i saw a mate after Kh6.Can you see it ?Its like a chess puzzle",
        "34... Kh6 35. g4": "35 g4?! was a move to make Rh4 .The next move shocked me by black to stop the mate.OMGoshhhhh",
        "35... Rd5": "Rd5 I got puzzled .But h4 solved all my fears after the exchange .Did u see how Mr Analyzer?",
        "36. h4 Qxe2": "All my God,the queen is so hungry to finish my pieces.But its over for black.Guess it.I hope you saw the move ",
        "37. Bg7#": "That was the slicing move .Black had not seen it and at that time i had 16 won games 2 losses and three draws .I was awarded a brilliancy 6th Month banner by Gameknot.Thanks for watching and following.I hope u enjoyed the game and the Queen Grab -mate -net"
