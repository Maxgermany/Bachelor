        "1. e4 d5 2. exd5 c6": "The Blackburne Gambit.  Black gives up a pawn to try to get faster development. ",
        "3. dxc6 Nxc6 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bf5 6. d3": "This might be unnecessary, as it blocks in the light-square Bishop.",
        "6... h6 7. Be2 e6 8. O-O Be7 9. Re1 O-O": "Black has slightly better Bishops and a tiny lead in development, but is still down a pawn.",
        "10. Nh4": "Very anti-positional to put the Knight on the edge of the board.",
        "10... Bh7 11. Bd2 a6 12. a3 Rc8": "Black tries to use the semi-open file.",
        "13. Bf3 Nd5": "Now the h4 Knight is attacked twice.",
        "14. Nxd5 exd5 15. g3 Bxh4 16. gxh4 Qxh4": "Now material is even, although White can retain the pawn with Bxd5.  The bigger problem for White is that the King is now exposed.",
        "17. Bg4 Rcd8 18. Bf4 Qf6": "Double attack on the Bf4 and b2.",
        "19. Bg3 Rfe8 20. c3 Rxe1+": "Rxe1 removes the defender of d3.",
        "21. Qxe1 Bxd3 22. f4": "White's King is already exposed.  f4 just makes increases the vulnerability.",
        "22... Qg6 23. h3 h5 24. f5": "If the Bishop on g5 moves away, the pawn will continue to h4 and win the pinned Bg3.",
        "24... Bxf5": "But this way, White is still able to snag another pawn.",
        "25. Bxf5 Qxf5 26. Qd2 Qxh3": "Yet another pawn--and now the King is completely exposed.  I think White just may have missed this hanging pawn.",
        "27. Qg2 Qxg2+ 28. Kxg2": "Black is happy to trade Queens with a three-pawn edge.  All three of Black's Kingside pawns are unopposed.",
        "28... d4 29. cxd4 Rxd4": "Black trades off the isolated pawn just to make the endgame win simpler.",
        "30. b4 f6 31. Bc7 Kf7 32. Bb6 Rg4+ 33. Kf3 g5 34. Rd1 Ne5+ 35. Kf2 Rc4": "The e4 N is covering the d7 square, so that Black's R can't create problems.",
        "36. Bd4 Nc6 37. Bb6 Ne5 38. Bc5 Rc3 39. a4 Nd3+": "This forces a trade of the Bishop and Knight, again simplifying the endgame win.",
        "40. Ke2 Nxc5 41. bxc5 Rxc5": "But now, White's R can penetrate.  It won't matter because of the material deficit.",
        "42. Rd7+ Kg6 43. Rxb7 Rc4 44. a5 Rc5": "White cannot protect a5 and so will lose another pawn.",
        "45. Rb6 Rxa5 46. Kd3 h4 47. Ke2 g4 48. Kf2": "White's King cannot do much to stop the pawns.",
        "48... Ra3 49. Kg2 Kg5 50. Rc6 Ra2+ 51. Kg1": "Once the Rook starts to help, the White King is confined to the edge of the board.",
        "51... h3 52. Rc5+ f5 53. Kf1 g3 54. Rd5": "Now Black can force a pawn through to promotion.",
        "54... g2+ 55. Kg1 Ra1+ 56. Kh2 g1=Q+": "White's move is forced.",
        "57. Kxh3 Ra3+": "Qh1+ is a way to win the Rook, but this checkmate is forced, and faster too.",
        "58. Rd3 Rxd3#": "Finis.  White's problems started with Na4.  Before that the position was quite solid.  With a pawn advantage, the goal should be just to play solid and try to get to a favorable endgame.  Perhaps White just tried to do too much."
