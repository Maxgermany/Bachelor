        "8... c4": "My book on the torre discourages the pawn push as it removes the tension and black loses dynamic play.",
        "9. Bc2": "White keeps his lsb glaring longingly at h7, the lynchpin that has undone many a careless player.",
        "9... Qb6 10. e4": "White concluded that it was better to trade the three pawns for a piece with a strong attack on the black King.",
        "10... Qxb2": "So it begins, black neglects development for several pawns in exchange for a knight.",
        "11. e5 Qxc3 12. exf6 Nxf6 13. Re1": "Black should move the queen now instead of allowing white the rook lift with tempo.",
