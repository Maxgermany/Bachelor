        "7... Nb6 8. Qb3": "possibly a mistake but also threatens bf7+ which leads to kd7 and hten maybe e6+ putting the pawn in a powerful well-protected position",
        "8... e6": "defended against that",
        "9. Be3": "wanted more backup on d4 pawn, better than bf4 i think because d4 pawn make move while e5 pawn wont. Maybe bd2 would have been better or nc3",
