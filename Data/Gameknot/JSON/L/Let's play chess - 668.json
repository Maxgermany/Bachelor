        "1. e4": "It's a very common and very easy to be developed through so many variations. Play as white, I usually start with 1. e2 e4 and hope black doesn't perform Sicilian Defense, I hate that ...",
        "1... e5": "A common and a quite good response to 1. e2 e4 ...",
        "2. Nf3": "Initiating an attack to black's pawn, I move the knight to f3... (King's Knight Opening, C40)",
        "2... d6": "Black move his pawn to d6, starting a strong Philidor's Defence, but here come a new problem. It's very hard to develop his king's bishop...",
        "3. Nc3": "Actually an usual response to break Philidor's Defence is moving white pawn to d4, but I want to try something new: moving queen's knight to c3. ",
        "3... Bg4": "3. ....... Bg4?\nI don't know why black move the bishop to g4, it's very weak... Actually Nc6 is better..\nBut as long it doesn't threat my king, I let it stand here.",
        "4. Bc4": "I move my bishop to c4 to prepare castling, a very common idea for beginner like me.",
        "4... h6": "Black move his pawn to h6, maybe he want to stop my knight's movements. Here I see a very good chance to attack black... A queen sacrifice! ",
        "5. Nxe5": "5. Nxe5!?\nI think it's the most interesting move in this game. Giving my queen to black! \n",
        "5... Bxd1": "Actually black must think it deeply, because I won't give my queen without any reasons. But, maybe he thought that I make an error or because I am still beginner (the last is right!)\n\nANALYSIS=\nHow if black refuse my queen and take my knight at e5? There's no problem. I'll take the g4 bishop and performing a well developed position.",
        "6. Bxf7+": "My bishop do a starting check 6. Bxf7+ !! \nThe king has no choices. He just can move to e7 since d7 is guarded by my knight.",
        "6... Ke7": "And a very beautiful checkmate that can't be avoided since 5. ..... Bxd1 ??\n",
        "7. Nd5#": ""
