        "1. e4": "my prefered opening move. i have read a comment that this a losing move.\r\ni don't see how one could ascertain such a conclusion, given there is only one move made, aside from esp.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3": "attacking and developing",
        "2... Nc6 3. Bc4 h6": "h6 has been played against this opening often, in my own experience.\r\nto defend the f7 pawn and a rook Q fork as well as hindering the knights forward movement",
        "4. d4": "i am looking to open the middle and attack. keeping the king from castling\r\nand gaining lead in development. the reason for this opening is to start the battling early",
        "4... d6 5. Be3": "he hasn't taken the pawn instead he defended his e pawn. i continue to develop. Be3 seems ideal spot can cover much ground from here, is not currently blocking me in and adds support to d4",
        "5... Nf6": "developing and attacking e4.  i wonder if f5 is better",
        "6. Nc3": "defend",
        "6... Bg4": "this move is another reason why Be3 was a prefered move early on",
        "7. h3 Bxf3 8. gxf3": "i take with pawn to open up g file",
        "8... Na5 9. Bb3": "i move here cause my king is in good shape in the middle and if he takes i could flank my rook",

        "14... O-O-O": "curious? this gains me a pawn ",
        "15. Rxa7 Kd7": "his caslting only caused him to be shoved back into the middle where i wanted him",
        "16. Rxb7": "now im up another pawn and threatening Rc7.  i continued to take peaces instead of developing more support for attack so there would be less to manuever around and it was not at all dangerous to me",
