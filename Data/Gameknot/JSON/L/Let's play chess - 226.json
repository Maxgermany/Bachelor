        "6... Bg7 7. Bg5": "What does black want to do?  BxN.  PxB.  QxP+.  White keeps the rook but is down a pawn and cannot castle.\n",
        "7... Qxb2": "Free pawn.",
        "8. Nb5": "QxR, QxQ, BxQ, Nc7+, white gets the rook back.  Black defends against the white fork first with Na6.",

        "17... Qb2": "Yep.  Wrong again.",

        "22. Nc3": "No!",

        "36... Bf8 37. Ba6": "Pressure builds.  Yay!",
        "37... Bd7": "Time to push the pawn, maybe.",
        "38. Ba5": "Nothing protecting that bishop.  Qa2 might have been better.",
        "38... Qxa5 39. Rba1": "No, now Pb6 is lost.",
