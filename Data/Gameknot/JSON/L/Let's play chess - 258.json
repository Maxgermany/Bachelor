        "1. e4": "Any comments are welcome, especially from all the higher rated players!\n\nThis is my game against a much higher rated opponent, so I decided to try the annotation feature and to learn more from my loss. :)",
        "1... c6": "black starts with Caro\u2013Kann defense, which at my level is a very rare choice.",
        "2. d4": "I was considering also c4 instead of d4, but then I would end up with an isolated d pawn, which could be a problem.",
        "2... d5": "main line.",
        "3. Nd2": "maybe not the best choice to block the bishop, but keeps my c pawn free to move and hopefully knight will not stay there for long",
        "3... dxe4": "I don't know why, but black takes,",
        "4. Nxe4": "so I am happy to advance my knight.",
        "4... Nd7": "black also decided to temporarily block his bishop. Somehow this move is considered to be ok, although for me the black's position looks very passive. White is ready to move both bishops, but black cannot move any of his bishops.",
        "5. Bc4": "simple development move.",
        "5... Ngf6": "black offers to exchange knights, ",
        "6. Qe2": "I have to protect my knight, because I don't want to take on Nxf6 giving up my only developed knight and helping black to get the other knight from d7 to f6. Moving Queen also prepares connecting rooks and possible castling long.\n\nNow I checked some chessok database and it says that 6. Nxf6 has been played a lot, even by some super GMs rated 2740, but my 6. Qe2 only by a few, the highest being 2177, so not even master level :(",
        "6... Nxe4": "black takes knight and gets another knight developed with a tempo.",
        "7. Qxe4": "ok, maybe it was not a good idea to move the Q, because now it will be chased away.",
        "7... Nf6": "I guess the only reasonable place for Q is d3.",
        "8. Qd3": ".",
        "8... g6": "black prepares for fianchetto, attacking d4 pawn,\nI will make b2-c3-d4 pawn chain to counter that black bishop.",

        "11. O-O-O": "I decided to castle long just to create more dynamic and exciting game. Black's fianchettoed bishop is pointing at this direction, but I was planning to move Q to d2/e3 and then Bh6. My plan didn't work out :)",

        "12. Bb3": "only square",
        "12... Bf5": "developing with a tempo.",
        "13. Qd2": "probably better was Qe2 or Qe3, but i was still hoping for a possible Bh6.",
        "13... a5": "now it's getting dangerous for my LSB,\nthere are obviously moves a3 or c3, I considered only c3, \nbut maybe a3 would be better for long term pawn structure, what do you think?",

        "18. Kxc2": ".",
        "18... Qd5": "In this position black king is fairly safe, but white king not so much, so white is happy to exchange queens.",
        "19. Qxd5": ".",
        "19... cxd5": "Who do you think is better now after all the exchanges? \nI think we are fairly equal. \nBlacks king is safer, but now after the queens are gone there are no threats to white king either.\nBlack has a bishop, which can give some advantage against a knight in endgame, but with so many pawns maybe it will not be the case. At least at the moment my pawn chain is pointing against the fianchetto, so it looks goods for me. \nWhat do you think?",
        "20. h4": "just starting to push my pawns, maybe create some threats to black king.",
        "20... a3": "I didn't expect this move.\nWhat should white do now?",

        "23... e6": "so now black has (almost) all the pawns on white squares, so the bishop can move freely.",

        "30... gxh5": "so now I have created 2 isolated pawns and one is fixed on black square h4, where it can be attacked by bishop,\nbut on the other hand my rook has the only open file.",

Rg2g7": "At this point I thought I was doing well, but maybe this was a big mistake?\nI thought I was going to exchange h4 to f7 pawn to have more space for my rooks, maybe even create some vague mating threats (if black moves f7 pawn then R1g6#: of course that's too obvious, but at least it limits some of the black's options).",

        "37. Nxa3": "so we have exchanged a3 and h4 pawns.\nI guess the last few moves were the decisive mistake creating passed pawn h5, which I didn't manage to stop.",
