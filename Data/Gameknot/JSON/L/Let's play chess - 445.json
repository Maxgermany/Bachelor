    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "black emerged from the opening having equalized the game, a symmetrical structure, less space, but a better light squared bishop, after some exchanges black was able to make a pawn break and convert in to an endgame with R+3P vs B+N, with two passed pawns and a pawn majority on the opposed wing white had trouble coordinating his pieces in defence of all threats so finally black achieved a win in a well played game",
        "1... Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4": "King's Indian, 4.e4",
        "4... c5": "to contest the pawn centre and play Nc6 after my c pawn push",
        "5. Nf3 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nc6 7. Be3 b6": "to open some lines for my light squares bishop",
        "8. Nxc6": "?! it turns black's job easier... ",
        "8... dxc6": "and with the symmetrical pawn structure black has equalized, from now on no major chances can be created by either side, we enter a game of attrition expecting the other player mistake\n",
        "9. Qxd8+ Kxd8": "white chooses to further simplify the game by exchanging queens",
        "10. O-O-O+ Kc7": "with the king on c7 I control d8, d7, d6 on the open column",
        "11. f3": "white diverged from the previous game I found, Mossin, Ao - Braathen, Tom, Sweden, 1993 (1/2-1/2), were white played Be2, with f3 white might want to free his knight from defensive tasks, by adding another defender the e4 pawn, but then he closes his light squares bishop and condemns it to defence, my light square bishop is better as it can get in front of my pawns to attack some white objectives, plus my knight is also better as my c6 pawn denies whites access to b5 and d5, while I can try to place my knight on d5 after playing e5 to protect it",
        "11... Be6": "the idea is to induce white into playing b3 further closing in his light squares bishop, plus before trying to play e5 I must exchange the dark squared bishops",
        "12. Kb1 Rad8": "now I'm prepared to exchange one of the rooks, and keep the other one in reserve",
        "13. Be2 h5": "now I've considered playing Bh6 to exchange the dark squared bishops, but then white has f4, so I decided against it, h5 also gets me some more space, plus with my light squared bishop in front of my pawns and my plan to exchange dark squares bishops it might help in limiting white's light bishop action",
        "14. h4": "the idea must be to block my h5 pawn to avoid it to gain more space",
        "14... Kb7": "now I prepare c5 and Bd7, I play Kb7 to avoid both Nd5+ and Nb5+",
        "15. Bg5": "I missed it, now I have a week e7 pawn to defend, white threatens e5 forcing my knight to move and then Bxe7 with a comfortable advantage",
        "15... Rxd1+": "I need to defend the weak e pawn, but I'll interpose one move first",
        "16. Rxd1 Re8": "now e5 is pointless, and I can return to my previous plan, but first I'll get white's bishop out of the way, or capture the h pawn in the process",
        "17. Kc2 Nd7": "opens the h8-a1 diagonal for my bishop",
        "18. b3 Be5": "now aimed at g3 and the h pawn might fall after f6 to remove the defending bishop",
        "19. Bd2": "!? white \"saw\" Bg3, but  now I can force the exchange of dark squares bishops, not necessarily bad for white, but he does have all but one pawn in light squares, and my bishop is more active, while his is defensive, so his light squares bishop is weaker than mine",
        "19... Bg3": "forcing Be1 by means of the threat Bxh4, as Rh1 abandons the d column to my rook",
        "20. Be1 Bxe1 21. Rxe1": "here my opponent offered a draw, I was tempted to accept but then I can play some more moves without risk of losing the hypothesis of a draw either, plus I have some strategic point to test:\n\na) I can now profit from a better bishop\nb) my knight is also more active, I have some outposts in c5, e5 and even a possible outpost on d4 after playing e5\nc) by playing e5 I'll improve my pawns by placing them on a dark square, plus I have an attack objective on white's h pawn, that may be exploited after some pawn break\nd) maintaining the c6 pawn defending against Nb5 or Nd5 is also an hypothesis as it keeps white's knight more constrained\n",
        "21... Nc5": "opens the d column, and prepares Ne6-d4",
        "22. Rd1 Bc8": "frees the e pawn to advance to e5, and allows Ne6 afterwards ",
        "23. Rd2": "?! the rook on doesn't improve its placement on d2, on the 1st rank it can move faster from wing to wing, I think my opponent just doesn't want to commit to any pawn advance or any other piece move",
        "23... e5": "blocks white's e and indirectly the f pawn, and controls d4 and f4",
        "24. Bf1 Kc7": "from now on I decided not to advance my c pawn any further as it restricts white's knight activity, and so I need to get my king back on c7, a dark square, were it controls d8, d7 and d6, releasing my pieces for attack purposes",
        "25. Ne2 f6": "prepares the pawn break with g5",
        "26. Kc3": "first I was a bit frustrated I could not see a way to profit from white's king and rook placement, so I decided to abandon c5 so I would not get any bad thoughts about some sacrifice that allowed me to play Nxe4, but would let me down in material",
        "26... Ne6": "with white's knight on e2 and the king on c3 I started again thinking of c5-Nd4 to get an excellent outpost or a passed pawn if white decides to exchange knights",
        "27. g3 g5": "all my pieces are in active positions and here we go for a pawn break, white control the d column but can't get his rook to easily shift from on side of the board to the other alnd his knight is concerned about blacks possible Nd4-c5",
        "28. Bh3": "the only good move white has to pin the knight",
        "28... g4": "but then I temporarily sacrifice a pawn to block white's bishop",
        "29. fxg4 Nc5": "and again threat Nxe4",
        "30. Bg2 Bxg4": "and I get the pawn back and opened up another column for my rook to get in white's camp",
        "31. Nc1 Rg8 32. Nd3": "? white needed to move either the rook or the king to avoid the tactics that follow",
        "32... Bh3": "a temporary sacrifice of the bishop and white has to chose between:\na) Bxh3 Nxe4+ Kc2 Nxd2 Kxd2 Rxg3 B moves and Rg2+ and black gets the rook and two pawns for his bishop and knight\nb) Bf3 Rxg3 Nxc5 Rxf3+ Rd3 Rxd3+ Nxd3 and we would enter a B vs N endgame were black have to fight hard for a win\nc) Nxc5 Rxg3+ Nd3 Bxg2 Re2 Bf1 Rd2 f5 exf5 e4 wins the knight",
        "33. Bxh3 Nxe4+ 34. Kc2": "forced",
        "34... Nxd2 35. Kxd2": "forced",
        "35... Rxg3 36. Bf5 Rg2+": "wins another pawn",
        "37. Kc3 Rxa2": "and I get three pawns and the rook for my two minor pieces",
        "38. Bg6 Rh2 39. Bxh5 e4": "zwischenzug before Rxh4 to gain a tempo and advance the e and f pawns a little further, if Nf4 I'll win a piece with Rxh4, if Nb4 I have the possibility of a5 with tempo",
        "40. Nb4 Rxh4": "after moving his bishop white might be tempted to play Kd4 but loses to c5 a double attack on king and knight, both knight and bishop are somewhat restricted... my plan is to use my king to add further support to my connected pawns\n",
        "41. Bg6 a5": "and the knight is further restricted by this move",
        "42. Nc2": "both Na6 and Na2 are worst as the knight would be out of play for a few moves",
        "42... Kd6 43. Nd4 Rh3+": "adding support to the third rank with tempo",
        "44. Kc2 c5": "again the restriction of the knight is under way and black has fixed the queen's wing pawns, and only the knight is able to attack b6, it would take three moves and the knight is needed defending the e and f pawns, so black's king is free to move foreword in support of his passed connected pawns, I expect Nf5 and reply will with Ke5, also possible is Nb5 with the idea b5-c7-a8, but by then white had lost too many tempi with his knight away from the centre...",
        "45. Nb5+ Ke5": "a square further closer to my centre pawns",
        "46. Nc7 f5": "and now the pawn advance is unstoppable unless white decides to sacrifice pieces to get them",
        "47. Nd5 f4": "sacrificing one wing pawn to advance further my central pawns",
        "48. Nxb6 f3 49. Nd7+ Kd4": "forced to defend c5 and support e4-e3-e2, now if Nb8 I can't play e3 or I will get mated with Nc6++"
