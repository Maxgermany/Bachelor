        "1. e4": "Annotating games of lower rated players isn't instructive for everyone.  However, it is instructive for the weaker player.  This is my first game on GameKnot so I have to start at a low rating and work my way up.  These annotations are for treborladlu.",
        "1... d5 2. e5": "This is an option many people choose against this defense.  In many cases it allows Black to transpose into the French Defense where his light-squared bishop isn't \"bad\".",
        "2... c5 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nc6": "I'm simply taking advantage of the fact that White's queen is in the center of the board.",
        "5. Qa4 Bd7 6. Qf4": "All of these Queen moves are wasting valuable time.  My friendly advice is to not neglect development.",
        "6... g6 7. Nf3 Bh6": "White may have assumed I was going to fianchetto my bishop on g7 because that's usually what lower-rated players have seen.  However, look at every possible place the bishop could go and you will be able to avoid these types of mistakes.",
        "8. Qh4 Bxc1 9. Nc3 Bxb2 10. Rb1 Bxc3+ 11. Kd1 Nxe5 12. Ng5 Qc7 13. Qf4 Nf6 14. Rb3 h6": "I would like to place my knight on e4 but in order to do so I have to kick White's knight away from g5.",
        "15. Nf3 Ne4 16. Ke2 Qc4+ 17. Kd1 Nxf2+ 18. Kc1 Qxf4+ 19. Kb1 Nxf3 20. Rxc3 Qb4+ 21. Rb3 Qe1+ 22. Kb2 Nd1+ 23. Ka3 Qa5#": "The mating sequence wasn't difficult to find.  Another piece of friendly advice is...take the gambit pawn in the opening and force Black to prove the worth of the defense.  "
