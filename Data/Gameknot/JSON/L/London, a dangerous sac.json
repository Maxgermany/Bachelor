        "1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. h3 e6 5. g4 Be4 6. Nbd2 Bd6 7. Nxe4": "A dangerous move. I expected BxB, with advantage by black. ",
        "7... dxe4": "Not BxB, because cxd6 conquers the center and deprives my knight of a good escape route. ",
        "8. Ne5 Nfd7 9. e3 O-O": "Passive, but not bad. I expected f6, with a slight advantage by black. ",
        "10. g5": "A typical London set. Early advance of the kingside pawns to concentrate the game on the black's castling. ",
        "10... Nxe5 11. dxe5": "As always, an unexpected move. My dsb is self.trapped, but it holds a cramped position for black. ",
        "11... Be7 12. h4 Nd7 13. Qd4": "Also interesting Qg4. It's a boring fight for the pawn, now...",
        "13... Nc5": "I thought b4, but then there is a solid attack from black on the black diagonal, after Na5, QXe4, c3, and the black queen can go to a5... ",
        "14. O-O-O": "Dangerous, but the key of the position is to have the kingside free for the rooks, in sight of a pawnstorm.",
        "14... a5": "Preventing b4, I won't play anyway.",
        "15. Bg2": "...and the pawn is won, but I will exchange my best bishop. Hmmm...",
        "15... Qc8": "QxQ would have been bad for black, but... this one... well, maybe...",
        "16. Qc4": "I am not in a hurry to take the pawn. It is better to prevent b5, that can gives black some countergame. ",
        "16... c6": "Now, c6 is not so important, because the queen is far from the black diagonal. \nBlack expects me to take the pawn, exchange the bishop and play b5. \nI decided that the game would have been really boring this way, and I launched a challenge. ",
        "17. Rd6": "!?\nI am crazy, no doubt. ",
        "17... Bxd6 18. exd6": "And black takes the bite. Now, my only advantage is positional. It won't be clear in few moves. ",
        "18... Na6": "I bet black now would have played b6 instead... and he would have been right. ",
        "19. Bxe4": "Now my bishops are mortal weapons.",
        "19... Qd7": "Maybe g6 was better, just to prevent what follows, but if so, h5, inmediately. ",
        "20. Qd3": "Threat on h7. Nothing special. ",
        "20... g6 21. Qd4": "Threating Be5, Bh8. Nothing special. ",
        "21... f5": "Big mistake, but what else?",
        "22. gxf6 e.p. Nb4": "It looks good, but black should have thought about defending, instead. But the danger isn't so clear, yet. ",
        "23. h5": "Threats to open the files. ",
        "23... Qf7 24. hxg6 hxg6": "Now, Bh6, Rd8, Bg7 looks ok. But not enough. \nI set conditional moves, here, but I was wrong. ",
        "25. Bxg6 Qxg6 26. f7+": "I simply didn't see the following move. Incredible. I thought that after Q or R x pawn, it would have been mate. No way. ",
        "26... Kxf7": "I started to sweat. Was I wrong? Black has a dangerous threat on the first row. Not to speak about Qxc2#.",
        "27. e4 Ke8": "Who cares about the bishop? :-)",
        "28. Rh6": "Who cares about Qg1+? Or Nxa2+?",
        "28... Qf7": "He correctly saw that the checks would have lead to nothing, but my quick win. So he defended. \nNow, QxB+ is something I cannot allow. So it's my turn to defend. ",
        "29. Bg5": "Who cares about Qxf2? Of course he cannot do it. ",
        "29... Kd7": "The normal answer, e5, is just holds the position for white. It is not bad, but I wanted to make him worry.\nHe didn't bring his other rook into the game. ",
        "30. f4": "Also possible Be7, but with the result to allow his f8 rook to bothe mine with Rh8. So I played this aggressive move. \nNo inmediate threat now, though. Qb6 at once is not enough to win. Once again, I have to stop my attack in order to defend. But you'll see what a nice pawn is this... :-)",
        "30... Nxa2+": "Mistake. But he thinks about the trap: if my king takes the knight, e5+ will make him win the game. ",
        "31. Kb1": "I have no intention to take the knight, but you have to be sadistic at chess :-D",
        "31... Nb4": "So, another defending tempo is lost for black! I've been very lucky. ",
        "32. Qb6": "What? I give away my very strong pawn in d6?",
        "32... Kxd6": "There is a reason. Now, e5 is pinned!",
        "33. f5": "Yummy!",
        "33... Rfe8": "It would have been better to move the other rook. ",
        "34. Bf4+": "The f pawn move had another nice consecuence: the bishop is now free to take part in the attack again. ",
        "34... Ke7": "Oh oh, b7 is lost. But, as correctly seen by black, to take it is not enough. \nRxe6 looks natural, but it is not the best. Can you find out the best one?",
        "35. f6+": "Qc5+ was not bad, but this one is too nice. Of course. I am sure I will win, and I am still -5! The sac was in move 17, and we are in move 35. A personal record. \nOf course, had black played well, I would have lost. My sac wan't \"correct\". \nBut it was in this game. ",
        "35... Qxf6": "Can you guess what, don't you...",
        "36. Qxb7+": "I'm sorry to be proud. This would be my last good game on GK, I am retiring. So I can allow indulgence to myself. "
