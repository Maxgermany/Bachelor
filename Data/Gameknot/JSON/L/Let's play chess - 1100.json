    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "(Back one for intro)\nThis is my favorite opening move and I see no reason to deviate from it now.",
        "1... e5": "Natural reply. I have seen it so many times, and I have experimented with countermeasures and I have chosen this one...",
        "2. Nf3": "...attempting the Ruy Lopez, by far the most common of my openings.",
        "2... Nc6": "And I am obliged! Now it's time for the pin...",
        "3. Bc4": "...but no! A deviation from my norm! This will now either be an exciting battle or a quick death.",
        "3... d6": "Of course. He wants his white-squared bishop to be free. Who doesn't?",
        "4. d4": "The e pawn was waiting on his d brother, and now they will fight side by side...",
        "4... exd4": "...not for long, I guess.",
        "5. Nxd4": "If black captures the knight, I have a devious plan.",
        "5... Nxd4": "And he does!",
        "6. Qxd4": "d4 is my queen's favorite square, even if she doesn't remain there for long...",
        "6... c5": "Pawns cannot touch my Queen! How dare he!?",
        "7. Qe3": "Cowering in fear of the \"threatening\" pawn :D",
        "7... Nf6": "Puzzling...it adds little to his attack, and gives me time to do...",
        "8. Nc3": "...THIS! I am now ready to exploit the hole on d5.",
        "8... a6": "Wasting time",
        "9. f4": "!? Why did I not take d5 right now? I probably should have, but this will work fine.",
        "9... b5": "I guess my bishop will have to retreat...",
        "10. e5": "...NO SIR! I always favor removing both of the opposing knights from the board over both bishops, and HERE is my opportunity. Here we go...",
        "10... dxe5": "Should've taken my bishop here",
        "11. fxe5": "Now he has no protection from my queen...except for my pawn, who will hopefully be moving soon...",
        "11... Ng4": "Something I did not predict. I fully expected a bishop capture followed by my capture of his knight. He opts to be aggressive against my QUEEN! No one touches her!",
        "12. Qf3": "Doesn't really threaten the knight, but it DOES threaten something else...",
        "12... Ra7": "This paved the way for the most controversial move that I played in this game...",
        "13. Qc6+": "WHAM! Right thru that hole! Even if she isn't there for long, her presence will be remembered...",
        "13... Bd7": "? Queen exchange would've benefited him more than myself, but he doesn't want to...",
        "14. Qe4": "My dainty queen is getting tired of this insolence!",
        "14... f5": "YES! OH JOY! OH RAPTURE! Next move I get to say it!",
        "15. exf6 e.p.+": "Pawn takes pawn en passant discovered check! YES!",
        "15... Be7": "Here comes another controversial move...",
        "16. Qxe7+": "WHAM! Queen straight into the jaws of Hell.",
        "16... Qxe7+ 17. fxe7": "Poor pawn...so close, yet so far...",
        "17... Kxe7 18. Bg5+": "Now that I have established a material advantage, it's time to exploit the lack of center pawns with this check. Not flashy, but workable.",
        "18... Ke8": "? Back to the home square? The monarch is far too passive!",
        "19. Be2": "That knight was bothering me, so my loyal bishop said GET OUT!",
        "19... Ne5": "Now that nothing can capture anything, it's time to secure my king. But...which side?",
        "20. O-O-O": "I didn't know which was stronger, so I chose this side.",
        "20... b4": "Pitiful knight threat.",
        "21. Nd5": "Long ago I said that I wanted my knight on the d5 square...and now, here he is!",
        "21... Bc6": "Another knight threat. However, TWO can play at that game...",
        "22. Bf4": "...Now his big decision must be made. Exchange or no?",
        "22... Ng6": "??? Completely incorrect, for it allows THIS...",
        "23. Nc7+": "...WHAM! Check with a protected knight. I love it.",
        "23... Kf7": "Basically forced.",
        "24. Bc4+": "BAM! More bishop action! Move, lazy monarch, move!",
        "24... Kf6 25. Rd6+": "Forking the king and that pesky bishop",
        "25... Kf5 26. Ne6": "Protecting my bishop",
        "26... Nxf4": "Exchanges incoming",
        "27. Rf1": "NOT! Now the knight has pinned himself! Bxg7 does not prevent a knight capture.",
        "27... Ke5": "? Walking right into the mouth of the waterfall? Why?",
        "28. Rxc6": "Mmm...beefy!",
        "28... Nxg2": "This was expected. However, I had little hope for the kingside pawns anyway.",
        "29. Rxa6": "I want the QUEENSIDE pawns. I have a distinct advantage over here, even though the a, b, and c pawns have not yet moved! :D",
        "29... Re7": "Now the knight is hungry...better give him a snack...",
        "30. Nxc5": "YUM!",
        "30... Ne3": "Supposedly forking the rook and the bishop. However, the counterattack proved devastating.",
        "31. Re1": "Now the knight is pinned! Black is now freefalling.",
        "31... Kf4": "The king pin is over, but the knight still protects the ROOK on e7.",
        "32. Nd3+": "I want to force the king towards the g and h files so my queenside pawns can promote.",
        "32... Kg5": "Thank you!",
        "33. Ra5+": "Testing to see if he will go to the h file",
        "33... Kh4": "and he does!",
        "34. Re5": "The killing blow. He can forget about winning now.",
        "34... Rhe8": "Irrelevant. He will be assimilated.",
        "35. Rxe7": "Resistance is futile.",
        "35... Rxe7 36. a4": "NOW I am going to promote that pawn, and the knight is STILL pinned!",
        "36... Re4": "A very weak threat",
        "37. b3 Kh3": "This shouldn't be hard to figure out now. I'll give closing thoughts at the end. Just watch.",
        "38. Nf2+ Kxh2 39. Nxe4 Nxc4 40. bxc4 h5 41. c5 h4 42. Ng5 h3 43. Nxh3 Kxh3 44. Rg1": "After this, black resigned. Black's only true mistake in this game was to underestimate the power that my queen had in the opening and the middle game. After I gained the material, black was toast. Thank you for watching one of my few wins. Feel free to send any comments as to what I might've done better. Thank you! :D\n-Russell"
