        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Bd3": "better was 6.Be2 , the problem of 2.Bd3 is that whites LSBs position is misplaced because of e4 pawn which blocks him , that's why 6.Be2 is better because the bishop doesn't interrupts his own pieces .",
        "6... e5 7. d5 a5": "black wishes to maneuver the b8 Knight from a6 to c5 , which is great spot for the knight , which pressure e4 pawn and blockade c5 pawn . the idea of a5 is to prevent white from playing b4 after blacks Nc5 , another idea of 7.a5 is to take space control on the queen side and avoid whites attempts to advancing his pawns on the queen side b4 and c5 and makes weaknesses on blacks queen side . that's why 7. a5 avoid b4  and Nc5 blocks c5 pawn  is important in my game plane .",
        "8. h3 Na6 9. Be3": "i think thats white wishes to avoid this Nc5 maneuvere  by  9. Be3 anh 8.h3 was to avoid 9...Ng4.",
        "9... Nc5 10. Bc2": "the first step of my game plane is completed , its not a good idea for black to exchange his DSB for my knight on c5 because of after 10.Bxc5 -dxc5 .11.Nxe5?-Nxe4!.12.Nxe4-Bxe5 . and if 10.Bxc5-dxc5.11.0-0 -Ne8 .... black blocks whites advance  on the queen side and white is all so stays with his LSB which it take a long time to get good position .",
        "10... Nh5": "i hade all so good option of 10...Ne8! , but i looked for more active game , with the idea is to play f5! and start to atttack on the king side which is one of the main idea of the king indian opening when black attacks on the kingside and white on the queen side .",
        "11. Qd2": "the idea of 11.Qd2 is to prepare 12. 0-0-0 and not Bh6 because of , blacks DSB is not the same DSB of the Sicilian Dragon and exchanging it wont be aproblem for me . my DSB is closed and not so effective , while white must keeps his DSB because of the DSB is one of whites pieces which active .",
        "11... b6": "black wishes to make the blacks knight  (on c5) position even stronger , and incase of 12.Bxc5-bxc5 and the B file will be opened for my rook and i will get some good game on the queenside to .",
        "12. g4": "white wishes to avoid me from playing f5 and stop my pawn advanced on the king side and at the same time wants to devorse my knight from the  aggressive h5 squaere , however this move makes some weakness on the dark squares.",
        "12... Nf4": "good move , what seems that white is going to win a free pawn , is not so simple , for example : 13.Bxf4-exf4.14.Qxf4-Ba6!.10.0-0( b3??-Bxc3+!, or Bb3?? - Nd3+!! )-Bxc3+!.11.bxc3-Bxc4 and blacks position is mutch better .",
        "13. Ne2": "better was 0-0-0 for my opinion , now white simpley loses his casteling rights and stayes on the center .",
        "13... Ng2+ 14. Kd1 Qf6": "my idea is to activate my queen as soon as possible , because of the weak position of the white king .",
        "15. Nh2 h6": "good move , the idea is to avoid Bg5 in the future what can be dangerous for me however this all so invitation trape for white 16.Bxh6-Bxh6.17.Qxh6-Qxf2 with the idea of Ne3+with good  wining chances , for example : 18.Rc1-Ne3+.19.Kd2-Nxc4+.20.Kd1-Nc4+.21.Kd1-Ba6.22.Rb1-Ne3+.23.Kc1-Bxe2 and win a free piece and with wining position.",
        "16. Bxh6 Bxh6 17. Qxh6 Qxf2 18. Kd2 Nf4": "another good move , threating to win a free piece and cutts off  the whites queen the diagonale for help .",
        "19. Rae1 Qg2": "the threat is still on , 20...Nxe2.21.Rxe2-Qxh1 and the white pieces fall one by one .",
        "20. Bd1": "all whites pieces forced  to retreat to save theire on king , however my activity of pieces is too much for white cane take , and i fined a nice way to pnish off the white king .",
        "20... Nxe4+ 21. Ke3": "better was  21.Kc1-Nd3+ .22.Kb1-Nxe1 but at least the white king stays a live for tempurarly .",
        "21... Qf2+": "and white resigns , he cant avoid the mate on 2 moves ,22. Kxe4 (forced)-f5+.23.gxf5-gxf5# or 23...Bxf5# thank you , and i hope you liked the game , i will like to read your comments ."
