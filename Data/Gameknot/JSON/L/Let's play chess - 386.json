        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Qf6": "4....Qf6?! , i don't think its good idea because of moving the queen so early in the game is violation of the game principles and cause a big problems ,  the queen blocks the black knight on g8 and force it to move to passive position , allowing Nf6 by moving out the queen its waist of tempo , 4....Qf6 is not developing move , it  actually interrupts it own Pisces . most popullar move in this position is 4....Nf6 ",
        "5. Nc3 c6 6. Bc4": "controlling central d5 square . by the time developing the BWS to acctive and strong position .",
        "6... Be6": " i think 6....b5 was mach stronger ,  now white stays with ''2 bishops'' advantange .",
        "7. Nxe6 fxe6 8. O-O Nd7 9. f4": "9.f4? olmost completlely white losing his advantange. 9.Qh5+g6.10.Qf3....white keeps his advantange .anyway the move 9.f4? opens agood game for black , 9...d5!10. e5- Bc5+.11.Kh1-Qh4 -+",
        "9... d5 10. e5 Qh4": "as i said 10...Bc5+  with tempo and than 11.....Qh4 with minimum equal game for black .",
        "11. g3": "11.g3!  it seems the white make its own weakness but after Be2-f3-g2- white cover it fine .",
        "11... Qh3 12. Be2 Nh6 13. Be3": "steel black can play 13...Bc5 , but after 14.Bxc5-Nxc5.15.Qd4 white get reed of his weak DSB. ",
        "13... Nf5 14. Bf2 Bc5 15. Bxc5 Nxc5 16. Bh5+ g6 17. Bg4": "another pawn on white square , and force the black queen retreet from it strong position . black cant fork the queen and the rooke because black will lose his knight , here white have a small advantange becuase of his strong bishop .",
        "17... Qh6 18. b4": "the idea is that white wishes to dump the black knight away from the center and take space on the queen side but after 18.b4-Nd7.19.Qd3 the position is steel uncleared .",
        "18... Ne3": "mistake , black exchange to Pisces for whites rook and one pawn give white totally domination on the board taking advantage of the far away black Pisces which unemployed .",
        "19. Qe2 Nxf1 20. bxc5": "not 21.Rxf1-Nd7 , the black knight is traped anyway .",
        "20... Nxg3 21. hxg3": "only 21...Ke7 but still black much worse .",
        "21... O-O 22. Bxe6+ Kh8 23. Re1": "centralisation ",
        "23... g5 24. f5 Rae8 25. Qe3 Re7 26. Ne2": "the idea is to move 27.Nd4! which blockade d5 pawn and defends the bishop on e6 its the best position for white now , because knights in position like those are strong as rook ,( see ''my system'' by Aron Nimzovich) it explains the importance of blockades .",
        "26... b5 27. Nd4 Rc7 28. Kg2": "threatinig Rh1 on the next move .",
        "28... Qh5 29. f6 g4 30. Rh1 Qg6 31. Bf5": "its a lost game for black now .",
        "31... Qe8 32. Qf4 Rg8 33. Qh6 Qf7 34. e6": "any retreet of the black queen causes  mate , 34...Qf8.35.Qxh7+-Rxh7.36.Rxh7# , black was  crushed  in this game and now black trys to earning time but no use .",
        "34... Rg6 35. exf7": "and black resigns . because of the ''mate net'' there is no way out now ,  hope you enjoyed the game , thank you  "
