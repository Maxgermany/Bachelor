    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "I've entered better in the game I had more space and initiative util losing it with an untimely pawn sacrifice the game was dull until 56. d5 that was probably the decisive mistake... black now had two weaknesses on opposed wings and allowed the exchange of pieces... white took a while to solve all difficulties but the game went on to a technical won endgame for white... I've resigned soon",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg4": "Ruy Lopez (C69), exchange variation, Alapin gambit",
        "6. h3 h5": "!? temporarily sacrificing the bishop to open the h column, if hxg4 then black would have hxg4 and white couldn't afford to move the knight due to the threat Qh4, so probably the best is g3 to open up an escape route via g2 but allowing gxf3",
        "7. d3 Qf6": "the main line to allow the long castle and at the same time threatening Bxf3, but while I have the bishop \"en prise\" I still need to keep my queen on the d8-h4 diagonal",
        "8. Nbd2 Ne7": "the idea is to get the knight to f4, Ne7-g6-f4",
        "9. b3": "only played nine times before, and the more drawish line (1W / 4B / 4D)",
        "9... Ng6": "the main line with 8 games played so far, Bxf3 only has one drawn game played with it...",
        "10. a3": "?! I dont get the point of this move is it to prepare b4, if so why play b3 first? It just loses one tempo in my opinion",
        "10... Nf4": "here white doesn't have g3 due to Bxh3 threatening the rook and also with a severe disruption of the pawn structure in front of black's king, could I sacrifice the bishop for two pawns to open up white's king position?",
        "11. Kh1 O-O-O": "the long castle as planed",
        "12. Bb2": "if white intended Bb2 why play 10.a3 ? he is just losing tempi",
        "12... Bd6": "to open the access to the g column for my other rook, also adds a defender to e5",
        "13. b4": "again loses one tempo",
        "13... g5": "I'll try to be aggressive on the king's wing to destroy white's castled position",
        "14. Nc4 Qe6": "freeing the f pawn and adding support to the bishop",
        "15. Rg1": "! only",
        "15... Rdg8": "now my position seams ready for an attack",
        "16. Ncd2 f6 17. Rb1 Bxf3": "to open the g column, I've considered also for some time Bxh3, but I don't like gxh3 Nh2 the rooks is free to play Rg3 and I lose the momentum",
        "18. Nxf3 Ng6": "here I've considered also g4, but I preferred to protect h4 first",
        "19. Nd2 g4": "threatening to open the columns in front of white's king",
        "20. Nc4": "! prevents any f5 breakthrough ideas I might have ",
        "20... Nf4": "?! I have a lots of doubts maybe gxh3 would be better in view of threatening gxh3 Qxh3++ but I didn't like the prospect of g3",
        "21. Kh2 g3+": "again I didn't like g3 after gxh3, so I've decided to sacrifice a pawn to open the position further, as it gives me another target",
        "22. fxg3 Ng6": "? I would like to my knight but white's knight on c4 says to me no way...",
        "23. Qf3": "I'm now thinking that my attack was unprepared, and I also think I might lose this game fast and in an ugly fashion...",
        "23... Ne7": "to open the g column",
        "24. Rgf1 Rg6": "to defend the f pawn, I'll just regroup my pieces and hang on to see what does white came up with",
        "25. Bc3 Kb8": "my king exited the h3-c8 diagonal to avoid any possible forced queen exchanges",
        "26. Be1 Nc8": "releasing the queen from the defence of the bishop",
        "27. Qf5 Qe8": "again avoiding the exchange, is possible because Qxf6 would lose the queen for one rook and one pawn...",
        "28. a4": "white is pushing on the king's wing, not much problem there I should hold",
        "28... Be7": "adds a defender to the f pawn",
        "29. Bf2 Bd8": "avoiding the possible Bc5",
        "30. Kh1": "white is just without any ideas, moving his king back and forth, does he just hope I'll make an error? Maybe that is his strategy...",
        "30... Rg7": "after regrouping my pieces, I'll exchange queens on my terms...",
        "31. Rb3 Qd7": "now we can exchange queens",
        "32. Qxd7 Rxd7 33. Kh2": "again as I said before, white is just waiting... (preying)\n",
        "33... Nb6": "offering the exchange, if he accepts my block of pawns in front of my king is enough to secure it's own defence... also attacks white's a pawn",
        "34. Nb2": "if white doesn't want to exchange he must defend the pawn or advance it (better yet for me)",
        "34... Nc8 35. Nd1": "white is moving the knight on to the other wing so I have to follow it",
        "35... Nd6 36. Ne3 Rg8": "I have my doubts about playing Rg8 or Rg7, but I didn't like Nf5 with tempo after Rg7, so I've decided on Rg8, with Rg7 white can't play g4",
        "37. g4 hxg4 38. Nxg4": "now Rg7 would have been better as I could play Rxg4 as the h pawn is pinned",
        "38... Rh7": "forces the knight back to e3",
        "39. Ne3": "forced",
        "39... Be7": "now white has a passed pawn and I don't have many move to choose from, I need though  to get my king to the other wing",
        "40. g3 Kc8 41. h4 Kd7 42. Kh3 Bf8": "the queens wing is easily blocked so I can focus on the king's wing, but without any pawns there I need to bring in my pieces and king",
        "43. c3": "just a wait and see move, or  white wants c2 for his knight",
        "43... Ke6": "now my king is well placed here",
        "44. Rb2": "so c3 was probably just to get another rank for the rook",
        "44... Be7": "again I don't have much to play, so I'll try a trap along the semi-open d column",
        "45. Bg1 Rd8 46. Kg2": "! it was better for me if the king would stay at h3, then Nf7 Rd2 Ng5+ the h pawn is pinned Nxe4 wins me back a pawn ",
        "46... Nf7 47. Rd2": "now I'll move the knight back to d6 to try to profit from the pin on d3",
        "47... Nd6 48. Rdf2": "white prevents my idea, now the game is unclear  to me, should I play Ne8, although it blocks the 8th rank overprotects the f pawn, but I didn't like the prospect of white playing Rf5 infiltrating my field or Nf7, but I disliked the variation after 49.Ng4... so I've decided to go for all or nothing and try a breakthrough on the queens wing",
        "48... a5": "now with all white's pieces on the king's wing I'll shift the action to the opposite wing to which my king is nearer",
        "49. bxa5 Ra8 50. Nf5 Bd8 51. Ra1 Rxa5": "I get back the pawn and now white must take care about his a pawn",
        "52. c4 b5": "immediately increasing the tension white can only capture with the c pawn and I can undouble my pawns after recapture",
        "53. Nxd6": "?! white has more space, so as a strategic principle he should avoid exchanges",
        "53... cxd6": "allowing me to undouble my pawns",
        "54. cxb5 cxb5": "I believe now this game can end in a draw",
        "55. Rfa2 b4": "I have some doubts about the obvious exchange of pawns and just avoiding it, but then this keeps some threats on both wing and I think I have two options to try and achieve a draw with this option, a dynamic one in which I defend my b pawn and white could never abandon the defence of the queen's wing pawn nor can he capture the b pawn without risk losing his a pawn, on the other hand I have a passive one were I sacrifice a pawn to block white's centre pawns, and have him try to work around my position to infiltrate it from behind...",
        "56. Rb2": "expected",
        "56... d5": "now I'll sacrifice a pawn to block white's bishop and his central pawns, then I'll try to exchange at least one rook, and hold the position to a draw, I've chose the more passive approach, as it is easier to play the other option to defend the b pawn could easily became to sharp I could also play Rb7 but I disliked my bad bishop, all my pawns would be on a dark square...",
        "57. Rxb4 d4": "now white's pawns are blocked and his bishop doesn't have much space also",
        "58. Rb8 Rd7 59. h5 Raa7 60. g4 Bc7": "white is pushing pawns, I still have to defend very actively, I need to get the a pawn to diverge my pieces to the other wing",
        "61. Rh8 Rd8 62. Rh7 Rda8 63. Bf2": "black wants to bring his bishop to e1 or h4 maybe",
        "63... Ba5": "denying him e1 but allowing the exchange of rooks I've preferred to keep them on and exchange bishops",
        "64. Rxa7 Rxa7 65. Rc1 Ra6 66. Rc4 Bd2": "from now on I'll defend my pawns with the bishop in front of them",
        "67. Kf3 Kd7 68. Ke2 Bf4": "untangling his bishop",
        "69. Be1": "black is ",
        "69... Rb6 70. Rb4 Rc6 71. Rb7+ Kc8 72. Rb2 Rc1 73. Rb6 Rc2+ 74. Kf3 Bg5": "can I hold this position?",
        "75. a5": "as of now we will have a 50th moves rule draw by move 125",
        "75... Kc7 76. Rb5 Ra2 77. Rb3 Kd8 78. Bb4 Kc7 79. Ra3 Rb2 80. Be1 Kb7": "I need to get that a pawn any way",
        "81. Ra4 Rh2 82. Rb4+": "we've reached a standby, white doesn't seams able to break in my defences, I might be able to hold the draw, unless he finds a way to bring his king in to the queen's wing",
        "82... Ka7": "! defends against Rb8, Rb7 and a6... after black played 84.Bb4 and 86.Bc5+ I've changed my assessment of this move to a ?",
        "83. Rb1 Ra2": "do I have a fortress? It seams so...",
        "84. Bb4 Rh2 85. Rf1 Bf4 86. Bc5+": "! now I think I'm lost, let's play some more moves to see if white makes his point and resign",
        "86... Ka6": "forced, but now I'll lose d4",
        "87. Bxd4 Rd2 88. Be3 Rxd3": "I get the pawn back but the position has opened up and my king is to far away from the king's wing my last chance is to get my king to b2 and my rook to the c column and to give perpetual checks ",
        "89. Re1 Bg5 90. Kf2 Kxa5 91. Bxg5 fxg5": "all forced until now",
        "92. Rb1": "so getting my king to b2 is now impossible before white captures my e getting...",
        "92... Rd2+ 93. Ke3": "and I'll resign a very calm game from white's point of view, no risks taken, just waited for my mistakes to profit from them..."
