White has a lot of options and kind of controls what will be the style of the game with the following moves (e.g. 4 f4, 4Nf3 4Be3 or 4 g3).\n\nI'm trying to get into this with the book Pirc Alert by Albert and Chernin :)",
        "2. d4": "Natural reaction from White, occupying the centre",
        "2... Nf6": "develops, attacks e4, most common move here in the Pirc I guess",
        "3. Nc3": "defends e4 the natural way",
        "3... g6": "preparing to give the dark-squared bishop a home on the long diagonal",
        "4. Bc4": "uncommon variation?",
        "4... Bg7 5. Qe2": "overdefending e4, developing the queen\n\nAs noted by Chesscentral there would have been the possibility of:\n4 ... Sxe4 5 Sxe4 d4 :) thx for the comment",
        "5... O-O": "maybe developing to Nc6 was attractive here, which also guards the critical point e5?",
        "6. Nf3": "developing, preparing to king-side castle",
        "6... Bg4": "pins the knight, attractive for a later Nc6xe4 threat",
        "7. e5": "cracking up the centre, preparing a deadly king attack ;-)",
        "7... dxe5 8. dxe5": "up to this point the game is equal I guess, however the knight needs to find a new home...",
        "8... Ne8": "? a bad decision, as the knight has no future here (only c7 which is not free yet). It would have been happier on h5, even it's on the dim.\n\n\nComment: My fear was that after Nd7 e6 woud follow. Of course fxe6 would yield Bxe6 Bxe6 Qxe6+. I did not feel that comfortable with that thought... Kh8 would have to follow since white could do Ng5! well... :) ",
        "9. h3": "asks the bishop for a decision",
        "9... Bxf3": "! kills the defender of e5 and weakens White's king side.",
        "10. gxf3": "?! interesting idea, White seems to plan queens-side castling and have an open g-file now.",
        "10... Nc6": "develops, attacks e5. However, the poor knight on e8 is definitely entombed now for a while...",
        "11. f4": "fixes the pawn on e5",
