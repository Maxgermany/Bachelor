        "1. d4": "I want to make a note for nobita2c if he ever reads this; especially after my game with muginz I was planning to offer a draw once this had played itself out.  It worked to a really interesting position so I'm sorry we couldn't finish it.",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nf3 c6": "This move was a part of my experiment with bishop's pawn openings.",
        "3. Nc3 d5 4. Ne5": "This move caught me by surprise.  I'm still unclear what the immediate objective was and I would recommend further development next time before moving in but Black is clearly not set up to remove the threat.  Even the fact that Black's Queen's knight can be picked off if it moves out may make this worthwhile.",
        "4... Bf5 5. f3 h6 6. g4": "Black's slow development leaves him open to pawn pressure which will be the theme of the game.  The black bishop especially exerts no power in the game until far too late.",
        "6... Bh7 7. e4 e6 8. exd5 exd5 9. f4 Bb4 10. g5 Nfd7 11. a3 Ba5 12. b4 Bc7 13. b5 O-O 14. gxh6 Qh4+": "Rather than recapturing with the pawn and leaving the g column open.",
        "15. Kd2 Qxh6 16. Ke1 Qh4+ 17. Ke2 Re8 18. Ke3": "An interesting choice to play the King forward.",
        "18... Nf6 19. Qf3 Nbd7 20. Qh3 Qxh3+": "White's aggressive pawn play feels unadvised, as his King-side pawns are a shambles and his bishops remain undeveloped.  Probable continuation is 21. Bxh3 Nb6 or Nxe5 and then who knows?  A real shame the game wasn't finished."
