        "1. e4 b6 2. d4 Bb7 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bd3 e6 5. Nge2": "I wanted to avoid too much symmetry, so I eschewed 5. Nf3.",
        "5... Be7 6. e5 Nd5": "Not. 6...Bxg2, 7. Rg1, Bf3, 8. exf6.",
        "7. Nxd5 Bxd5": "Or 7...exd5, 8. Ng3 with an eye to 9. Nf5.",
        "8. Nf4": "Guarding g2 while attacking the centralized bishop. Best here is 8...Bb7, 9. O-O, d7.",
        "8... c6": "This loses at least a pawn by trapping the bishop.",
        "9. c4 g5": "His best hope, but it ruins his pawn structure and opens his kingside to attack.",
        "10. cxd5 gxf4": "He probably should have interposed 10...Bb4+, 11. Bd2, Bxd2, 12. Qxd2, gxf4. At this point, white needs to choose among 13. Qxf4, 13. d7 and 13. dxe6. I'm partial to 13. d6, Qg5, 14. g6!",
        "11. d6": "Don't worry, the f4-pawn is in the bag. But with 11. d6, white pretty much stops black's development cold.",
        "11... Bg5 12. Qf3 f6": "Black has a way of trapping his bishops. He no doubt hopes for 13. exf6, Qxf6, protecting the f-pawn.",
        "13. h4": "This couldn't have been played earlier because the black queen backed up the bishop. Now the bishop must die.",
        "13... fxe5 14. dxe5 Bh6": "And so, the f-pawn never does get taken, because white's next move is the last move of the game.",
        "15. Qh5+": "And black resigns."
