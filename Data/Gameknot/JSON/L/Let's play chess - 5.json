        "1. f4": "Birds Opening",
        "1... d5": "Standard responce. most players will revert to basic opening principals when facing an unfamiliar opening. this move is follows those principals pretty well. ",
        "2. e3": "Whites plan is to control the central dark squares with both pawns and his fianchettoed dark square bishop",
        "2... c5": "the position is now a reversed dutch setup. this must be good for white as this is totally playable as black, white just needs to find a useful move for the extra tempo.",
        "3. Nf3 Nc6 4. b3 e6": "leaving the bishop inside the pawn chain. slightly passive but by no means bad, the light squared bishop can often find useful employment on the queenside.",
        "5. Bb2 Nf6 6. Nc3 Be7 7. Ne2": "as the position is quite closed white can afford to reposition this knight this early in the game",
        "7... O-O 8. Ng3 Bd7 9. Bd3": "now black has castled white starts pointing his pieces at the enemy kingside",
        "9... a6": "white has declared his intentions to play on the kingside so black starts expanding on the queenside ",
        "10. O-O": "white moves his king out of the centre and puts a rook on the f-file which is likely to become at least half open during the course of the game.",
        "10... b5 11. c4": "?! white attacks the black queenside pawns along with the black centre",
        "11... Nb4": "this way black will have the bishop pair to compensate for his weak c pawn when he opens the game up with exchanges on c4",
        "12. Qb1": "? should have moved the bishop, i missed the nice little tactic white has after exchanging the bishop",
        "12... Nxd3 13. Qxd3 Bc6": "? threatening to exchange queens when the position opens up which will give black the d file for one of his rooks which will then point at whites weak d-pawn. however black could bag a pawn here by 13...dxc4 14.bxc4 bxc4 when Qxc4 runs into Bb5 although black might have trouble holding on to it in the long run black will definatly get a better position after white tries to win the pawn back",
        "14. Ne5": "simple way to counter the threat, forcing the bishop to retreat and preventing any future skewering of the queen and rook with Bb5",
        "14... Be8 15. Rac1": "? i think Qe2 was required here, black has a definate plus after dxc4",
        "15... Qa5": "once again black is reluctant to relieve the central tension. note that the queen isn't actually threatening the a pawn as after Qxa2 Ra1 followed by Rfb1 traps the stray queen",
        "16. Rc2": "now that dxc4 is no threat i decide im going to double rooks on the c file and then open the centre in a way favourable to myself as it seems inevitable that the game will soon become quite open",
        "16... Rd8": "renewing the threat of dxc4",
        "17. Bc3": "?! prehaps not the most productive move, it just gives black the chance to reposition his queen",
        "17... b4": "?! blocking up the position surely favours white even though black has a space advantage it is difficult to exploit in a closed position.",
        "18. Ba1 Qb6": "blacks queen was doing nothing on a5 so black seeks a better square for her royal highness",
        "19. Qe2": "the white queen also starts looking for more productive squares, as the queenside is blocked whites continues with his original plan of kingside attack",
        "19... a5 20. Ng4": "whites forces are very disorginised but as the position is so closed now white has alot of time to reorginise",
        "20... d4": "!? interesting, trying to block the white bishop in but giving white a passed c pawn as a result. black needs to play vigorusly after this else white will simplify to an endgame where white has a definate edge",
        "21. exd4 cxd4 22. d3": "trying to both keep the position closed and improving comunication between my pieces by opening the 2nd rank for the c2 rook",
        "22... a4": "threating to block the bishop in on a1, this threat isn't hard to meet...",
        "23. Bb2 a3": "i dont think relieving the tension is best here i was planning on switching the bishop to a more productive diagonal anyway",
        "24. Bc1 Nxg4": "as black has more space he should be trying to aviod exchanges leaving white position more cramped",
        "25. Qxg4 f5": "?! this weakens the e6 pawn to much, i feel",
        "26. Qe2 Bf7": "?? leaves the f pawn undefended",
        "27. Nxf5": "so it gets taken",
        "27... Bc5": "threatens the knight and blocks whites passed c pawn. ",
        "28. Ng3 Bg6": "targeting the weak d pawn",
        "29. Ne4": "blocking the attack on the pawn and centralising the knight",
        "29... e5": "difficult to find anything else for black to play here. note that black doesn't actually lose a pawn here as a white pawn on e5 will be easily won by black.",
        "30. fxe5 Qc6": "black is trying to create a passed d pawn by forcing exchanges on e4 and as black isn't pressuring the e pawn i decide to try to hold on to it which i can do now as black has neglected to put pressure on it",
        "31. Nxc5 Qxc5 32. Bf4": "now white just has to reposition his c2 rook and his position will be fine and being 2 pawns to the good this is easily a winning advantage",
        "32... Rf5": "finally starting to presure the weak e pawn, but as it is on a dark square white can hold on to it",
        "33. Rcc1 Rdf8": "doubling on the f file, the best chances for black are in counter play however due to the closed queenside it is hard to find a better way for black to achieve this",
        "34. Bg3": "White welcomes exchanges",
        "34... Bh5 35. Qe4 Bg6": "? letting white trade queens and get 2 central connected passed pawns",
        "36. Rxf5": "White has to exchange the f1 rook first else black can get a passed d pawn after 36.Qd5  Qxd5 37.cxd5 Rxf1  38.Rxf1 Rxf1  39.Kxf1 Bxd3",
        "36... Bxf5 37. Qd5+ Qxd5 38. cxd5 Kf7": "a nice idea for black here, he aims to centralise his king while mine is hemmed in by his f8 rook",
        "39. Rc4 Bxd3 40. Rxd4 Bb1 41. Rxb4": "at first sight this looks terrible as white loses the d pawn after 41...Bxa2 42.Ra4 Bxb3 43.Rxa3 Bxd5 when black has very real drawing chance due to the opposite coloured bishops, however white is not obliged to play Ra4 after black captures the a pawn. black cannot in fact capture the a pawn without immediate disaster",
        "41... Bxa2": "? the bishop leaves the defence of f5 which is in fact very important",
        "42. e6+ Kf6": "? this no longer works as the black bishop cant block the check on f5. the best try is Ke7 but after 43.Rb7  Kf6 44.e7 R38 45.d6 black does well to defend this position",
        "43. Rf4+": "here black would love to be able to play Bf5 to block the check when black aviods immediate catastrope, but as it is black loses his rook for the 2 pawns ",
        "43... Ke7 44. d6+ Ke8": "?? black now gets checkmated, he should take the pawns for the rook but either way white wins",
        "45. Rb4": "black cannot stop Rb8#, he can only delay it by sacrificing his rook with check.",
        "45... Rf5 46. Rb8#": "1-0. if you have any questions/comments about the game feel free to message me about it."
