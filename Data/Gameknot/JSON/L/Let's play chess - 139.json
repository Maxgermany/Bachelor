        "1. f4 b6": "I've been experimenting with a universal b6 defense.  This is the first time that I faced f4.",
        "2. d4": "This, I thought, was unusual.  b6 tries to control the light squares with the B and d4 just creates a light-square hole on e4.",
        "2... Bb7 3. e3 e6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Bd2 O-O 7. Bd3 Bxc3 8. Bxc3 Ne4": "Dropping the N into the light-square hole.",
        "9. Bb4 d6 10. O-O Nd7 11. c4 f5": "Supporting the N further, while keeping the diagonal open for the B.",
        "12. Be1 Ndf6 13. Bh4 Qe8": "Immediately removing the pin.",
        "14. Ng5": "This surprised me.  While Ng5 does go after Black's weakness on e3, I would have thought more preparation was needed, like Rc1, b4, c5 etc.",
        "14... Nxg5 15. Bxg5 Qg6 16. Be2": "I'm not sure of White's intention here.  Even without Be2, Ng4 can be met easily.  Maybe Bf3 was the eventual intent?",
        "16... h6": "White will now lose material as the B is pinned against a mating square g2.",
        "17. Bxf6": "White blunders and misses the tactic.",
        "17... Qxg2#": "White had more space and the ability to attack Black's pawn structure.  I think that was what was called for, rather than a direct Kingside attack."
