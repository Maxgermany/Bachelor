        "5. c3": "I plan to develop the b1 knight to d2 anyway. ",
        "5... Bd6 6. Ne5 Nbd7 7. e3": "Still safe. If black exchanges, I have time to defend e5 before black can threat it another time. ",
        "7... c5": "Good. Black \"must\" play this move sooner or later in this opening. ",
        "8. Qf3": "The white pieces are already pointing to the black's kingside. ",
        "8... Qb6 9. b3": "Black can try some kind of sac here, like c4, 16. b4, Bxb4. White threats Nxf7, KxN, g4... another interesting tactic sac. I can't bet for any of the two sacs, deeper analysis would be necessary. ",
        "9... O-O": "Getting into the enemy's play.",
        "10. Nd2": "I've done this one since black can attack with c4, threating c4xb3 (which is bad for me, and I cannot defend it easily) or Qb2, if I take the pawn.\nNow, by this move, I'm setting the \"trick\": Nd2-c4, and he cannot take it because Nxc4, trheatening the queen and the bishop at the same time, recovering my piece and a pawn, along with a good position. \nBd3 was ok, apparently, and if c4, Bc2. But after Ne4, I'm giving him an \"attacking\" position, I didn't like it. \nBe2 sets the threat Qg3 (for Bh6), but it is easily met, and there are a lot of ways the game can go on. \nI hoped the trick I am building is too deep for him to see. Anyway, not a bad move as it seems to be.",
        "10... h6 11. Be2": "This is to avoid Nh4 after Qg3. ",
        "11... Nh7 12. Qg3 Bxe5 13. dxe5": "The anti natural key move of this opening. ",
        "13... Kh8 14. Nf3": "I am already seeing the knight sac on g5.",
        "14... f6 15. Bd3 f5": "My bishop is blocked, but this allows me to play the sac (Ng5). Black's self blocked pieces are playing in my favour, so I have time for another preparatory move.",
        "16. Qg6 Qd8 17. Ng5": "I liked it. It is not a \"perfect\" sac, but it was too nice not to play it. ",
        "17... Nxg5": "The only one.",
        "18. hxg5 Qe8": "Black thinks all his problems will fade by exchanging queens, but it is not so easy. ",
        "19. Rxh6+": "Second sac...",
        "19... gxh6 20. Qxh6+ Kg8 21. O-O-O": "This simple move is definitory. Black is tied to defend the h column, and this allows me to play freely and eventually recover the piece. ",
        "21... Qe7": "Or Qf7 (the only way to stop the Rh1 threat). ",
        "22. Rh1 Qg7 23. Qxe6+": "At first, I thought about Bxf5 after the black's move. This is not enough to win. I was sweating, since if the sac doesn't bring me to a victory, I will be playing an idiot. ",
        "23... Qf7 24. Qh6 Qg7": "Same as before, but, now my e pawn is free...",
        "25. Qxg7+ Kxg7 26. e6": "Another simple move that makes the difference. Black cannot move the knight, because it is mate in few moves. He must have returned the piece, but still with a weak position. \nc4 gives him a breath, but without avoiding the mate threat. If black lets me take the knight, his king would have had a square to escape... but he, apparently, didn't see it. ",
        "26... Nb6 27. Be5+": "And the forced mate sequence is set. ",
