        "1. f4": "Hi everyone. I was challenged to this game by one of my good friends (i played black). His rating was 1175 when we started, and I was at 1492. He tried my opening as white, and i thought i would respond with....",
        "1... Nc6": "Nc6. I didn't really care for moving any of the center pawns just yet.",
        "2. e3 d5 3. d4": "I don't like this move, and it's obvious why. White does control e5, but his white squares are weak and he creates a backward pawn on e3. For those of you who don't know what a backward pawn is, it's a pawn that cannot be guarded by another pawn. Thus, he has to commit one of his pieces to defending it if it gets attacked.",
        "3... Nf6 4. Nf3 Bf5": "Development....wanting to get the bishop out before I close the diagonal off.",
        "5. Nc3 e6 6. h3": "Don't understand the point of this move... maybe to play g4 next",
        "6... Bb4": "As you can see now I have all minor pieces developed with no real weaknesses.",
        "7. Bd2 Ne4 8. a3": "Not a good move either. Reason for that is now I can play Bxc3 and after Bxc3, I have Nxc3.",
        "8... Bxc3 9. Bxc3 Nxc3": "Now he must take with the b pawn. You generally don't want doubled pawns because they are hard to defend.",
        "10. bxc3 Be4 11. c4": "Good move, trying to get rid of the double pawn.",
        "11... O-O 12. c5": "?????? I thought he would take....",
        "12... Qe7 13. c4 Rad8": "Playing to blast open the middle. I want to do this because I have a more solid position.",
        "14. Ne5 Nxe5": "Don't want that knight to do anything and my knight on c6 wasn't doing much.",
        "15. fxe5 f6": "Again playing to open up the center. But I saw this and I wanted to open up the f-file for my rook.",
        "16. Bd3": "This doesn't do much, he should have castled or done something to keep it closed.",
        "16... fxe5 17. Bxe4 Qh4+": "Very annoying check for him....",
        "18. Kd2": "He responds correctly.",
        "18... Rf2+": "Unfortunately for him, another annoying check.",
        "19. Kc3 exd4+ 20. Qxd4 Qxe4 21. Qxe4": "He had to do this because I had Qc2 and that would be very inconvenient for him. Also, his g pawn is under alot of pressure.",
        "21... dxe4 22. g4": "Getting the pawn out of harm's way....",
        "22... a5": "I played this because rook d3 is checkmate. He really has only 2 choices, either to play King b3 or to get a rook on the d-file. But for now I am hoping he doesn't see it.",
        "23. h4": "He missed it...",
        "23... Rd3#": "So overall this game goes to show that position is very important. Hopefully you were able to take something from this. "
