        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3": "so far so good ;)\r\nI almost always play this part with white.",
        "2... d6": "bad move of black, it blocks his bishop on the black line.\r\nNc6 would have been better.",
        "3. d4": "I don't mind getting more control in the center, therefore I push my pawn forward to d4.",
        "3... Bg4": "ow how cute he attacks my knight.",
        "4. d5": "well I don't want to be forced to strike back with the g-pawn so I move my pawn to d5 to prevent it from being taken.",
        "4... Bxf3 5. Qxf3": "well I didn't expect this trade so soon, but my queen is now active and I'll leave it standing here untill I find the need to move it again.\r\nIt is in no danger of being attacked on the first 3 moves.",
        "5... Nf6 6. Nc3 Na6 7. Bb5+": "hmmm his knight left the back squares leaving the field c6 undefended. I can win a pawn if black moves as I hope.",
        "7... Nd7": "he didn't play c6 as I was hoping, but at least my queen got more movement freedom.\r\nI might save that movement for later.",
        "8. h4": "planning to play Bg5, but not certain if this is such a good idea.",
        "8... Nb4": "strong move. black's knight is finally becoming active.",
        "9. Ba4": "I need to defend c2 but I don't want to move my queen away from the f-line.",
        "9... b5": "black tries to lure me into Bxb5 after which he takes c2 with his knight and wins my rock.",
        "10. Nxb5": "thankfully my knight was also protecting b5.",
        "10... Nc5": "after this move black never got a chance to avoid checkmate.",
        "11. Nxd6+": "check with both my knight and my bisschop so he has to move his king.",
        "11... Ke7 12. Nf5+": "again check with my knight, his king is forced to move along.",
        "12... Kf6 13. Nh6+": "and another check in the sequence leading to checkmate.",
        "13... Ke7": "black probably thought that I would move my knight to f5 again.",
        "14. Qxf7+": "I took his pawn at f7 with check, black has only 1 move remaining: Kd6.\r\nafter which I planned to move my knight to f5 with checkmate."
