        "4... Nf6 5. Qf4 e6 6. e5": "White chases the Knight from f6 but opens the a1-a8 diagonal.",
        "6... Nh5": "Maybe Nd5 was better, but I was not ready to exchange Knights yet.",
        "7. Qg5": "Leaving my Knight no where to go thus forcing an exchange of Queens.  I looked upon such an exchange favorably as he had already moved his Queen thrice and this would be my only Queen move.",
        "7... Qxg5 8. Bxg5 h6 9. Be3 Bb4 10. f3": "He apparently prefers this pawn setup over possibly doubled f pawns besides he is really trying to trap my King's Knight.",
        "10... g6": "Providing a withdrawal point for the Knight.",
        "11. g4 Bxc3+": "Before withdrawing the Knight I elect to exchange on the Queenside, leaving him with doubled pawns there.",
        "12. bxc3 Ng7 13. Bh3 Nc6 14. Ne2 Na5": "Opens the Bishop's diagonal attacking the pawn at f3, eyes the c4 square and stops f4 temporarily.",
        "15. O-O": "It does protect the f3 pawn.",
        "15... Nc4": "The Knight can not be driven from this post by a pawn.  White finds it necessary to move his Bishop again.",

        "18... Be4": "Attacking the c2 pawn.",
        "19. f5": "He either did not see the attack on c2 or considers the pawn advance adequate compensation or stronger or perhaps both.",
        "19... Bxc2 20. Nf4 gxf5 21. gxf5 Nxf5": "This provides an open file to his King.",
        "22. Rf2 Rdg8+ 23. Rg2 Rxg2+ 24. Kxg2 Rg8+ 25. Kf2 d6 26. exd6 cxd6": "The pawn activity was undertaken to simplify the center and provide me with some time to decide the best course for my pieces.  Unfortunately, as White's next demonstatrates I have taken away the withdrawal point for my c4 Knight.",
        "27. Bf1 d5": "Defending the Knight and opening d6 again.",

        "31... Kc6 32. Rb5 Nd6 33. Re5": "Exchanging Rooks on the 2nd rank is no longer an option but an exchange on the fifth rank can now be forced.  After reveiwing the board I decided that his h pawn could be handled.",
        "33... Rg5 34. Rxg5 hxg5 35. Nh5": "He discovers attack on my g5 pawn.  ",
        "35... Bc2": "I felt (perhaps wrongly) that g4 followed by f4 was too drawish and I had better chances with my queenside pawns (a thought that I needed to pay better attention to, later).",
        "36. Bxg5 Bxa4 37. h4 Ne4": "To force an exchange of my Knight and his Bishop or win a pawn.",
        "38. Bd2 Nxd2 39. Kxd2 Kd6": "Heading to the kingside to stop his h pawn.",
        "40. Nf6": "I am not sure where he was headed with this but it provided my King some additional time on his way to the h file.  Perhaps he wanted to keep the diagonal h5-e8 blocked by my pawn.",
        "40... Ke7 41. Ng4 f5": "My King is in position to stop the h pawn and the Bishop now has a way to approach the pawn.",
        "42. Ne5 b5": "Which I immediately block!!??",
        "43. h5 Kf8 44. h6 Kg8 45. Nc6": "So that is where he was headed!! Nothing I can do now but trade pawns.  I think I am getting the better of the deal.",
        "45... Kh7 46. Nxa5 Kxh6 47. Ke3 Kg5": "To keep his King from getting thru to e5.  And my Bishop also has an avenue by which it can become active again.",

        "62. Ne5 Kh4": "After a good deal of analysis, I decided that my King had to take a longer route to the other side of the board and that the f pawn's best use would be in exchanging off the minor pieces.",
        "63. Nxf3+ Bxf3 64. Kxf3 Kg5 65. Ke4 Kf6 66. d5 e5": "This was the move I found in my analyis that lets me get my King over to the queenside.",
