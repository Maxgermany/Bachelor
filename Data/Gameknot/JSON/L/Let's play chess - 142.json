        "1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 Nc6 5. b3 e6 6. Bb2": "I've been experimenting with the Zukertort-type setup.",
        "6... Bd6 7. Nbd2 O-O 8. O-O Bh5 9. Ne5 Bxe2 10. Qxe2 Nd7 11. f4": "This was probably a mistake.  I think Nxc6 was better here, giving Black an isolated a-pawn.  I could have followed with f4 if desired, or also Nf3.",
        "11... Ndxe5 12. fxe5 Be7 13. a3": "Black's N is largely out of play, but White has little ability to generate a Kingside attack.",
        "13... f5 14. Rf3": "I think exf6 e.p. would have given White better attacking chances.",
        "14... Bh4 15. Raf1 a6 16. Rh3": "The R is horribly misplaced here and takes forever to get back into play.",
        "16... g6 17. c4": "This diversion is way to early.  I should figure out how to get a grip on the c-file first if I am going to open it up.",
        "17... Bg5 18. Nf3 Be7 19. cxd5 Qxd5 20. Qc4 Rfd8 21. Qxd5 Rxd5": "White has traded into a terrible position.  Nf3 has no good squares.  Rh3 is virtually out of play.  Bb2 has a blocked diagonal and no scope.  Black's pieces are much better.",
        "22. Nd2 b5 23. Rc1": "This is the only useful diagonal.",
        "23... Nxe5": "This was a nice tactical shot that I actually missed.  If White plays dxe5, Black plays Rxd2 with tempo.",
        "24. Rxc7 Re8 25. e4 Rd7 26. Rc2": "This might not have been best either.  Rxd7, Nxd7, Rc3 would have seized the file anyway.",
        "26... Nf7 27. e5 Bg5 28. Nf3 Be3+ 29. Kf1 Ng5 30. Nxg5 Bxg5 31. Rf3 Be7 32. Ke2 b4 33. a4": "Now the position is blocked up.  No one has much play.",
        "33... Bd8 34. Rc6 a5 35. Rf1 Rc7 36. Rfc1 Ree7 37. Rd6 Rcd7 38. Rdc6": "Draw was agreed.  "
