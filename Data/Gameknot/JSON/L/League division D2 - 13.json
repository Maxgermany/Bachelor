        "1. e4": "Here's a nice win from a familiar opening, using a well-known thematic sacrifice.",
        "1... c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6": "The Najdorf Sicilian.  I continue with my revived interest in 6. Bg5.",
        "6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qc7 8. Qf3 b5 9. Bd3 b4": "I think this is probably premature.  Black needs to get his King to safety and develop his pieces.",
        "10. Nd5": "!? A speculative sacrifice as I didn't have a concrete plan in mind.  But I knew this move was thematic from past studies of games by Velimirovic, Ljubojevic and Gligoric, to name a few Yugoslavians of the 70s who indulged in this line.",
        "10... exd5 11. Bxf6": "White takes the opportunity to damage Black kingside pawn structure",
        "11... gxf6 12. O-O-O": "Castling queenside quickly centralises White's QR and prepares for further line-opening.",
        "12... Bg7 13. exd5 Nd7": "I think castling immediately would have been better.  Now Black's king is trapped in the centre.",
        "14. Rhe1+ Kd8 15. Qh5": "White homes in on the weak f7 pawn but an immediate 15. Nc6+ would have been even stronger.",
        "15... Nc5": "Black creates an escape square for his King but c8 would have been a better one.",
        "16. Nc6+ Kd7 17. Qxf7#": "Very satisfying :-)"
