        "14. Bb5": "This is a weak move. 14. Ng5 was much better. 14. Bg5 was also not bad. White has to create some play against the black king, who will castle kingside soon.",
        "14... O-O 15. Bxc6": "Giving up the bishop pair.",

        "26. Bxd4": "26. fxe3 was necessary. Then after 26..., Bxc3 27. bxc3, Qe6! the white queen is shut off from the defence of the kingside.",
        "26... e2": "A nice \"Zwischenzug\". This kind of move is always hard to spot, since if you take a whole piece of the board, somehow your attention gets focused on that piece exchange. My opponent told me he liked this move. I could not find out how to respond to his resignation note, so I decided to annotate the game. The rest of the game is not important anymore.",
