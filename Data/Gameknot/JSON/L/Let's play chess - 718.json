        "1. b3": "I open this game with an unusual opening, hoping to draw Black into a variation he's uncomfortable with. My goal is to control the flanks and at the correct time, make a decisive central thrust.",
        "1... e5 2. Bb2 d6": "Black plays rather passively. 2...Nc6 develops a piece and preserves the option of moving the d-pawn 2 squares.",
        "3. e4 Nf6 4. Nc3 c6": "With Black having 2 pawns on the central dark squares, 4...c5! seems to be indicated. Afterwards, the plan would be to move the Queen Knight to c6 and d4, centralizing it nicely.",
        "5. Nf3 h6 6. d4": "If Black's c-pawn were at c5, White could not make this central thrust.",
        "6... exd4 7. Nxd4": "Now it is White's knight that is centralized.",
        "7... Bg4 8. Be2 Bxe2 9. Qxe2 Be7": "White has an advantage in development and controls more space.",
        "10. O-O Nbd7 11. Nf5 O-O 12. Nxe7+": "I gain a minor exchange.",
        "12... Qxe7 13. Rad1 Nc5 14. f3": "Preventing ...Ng4, with potential disruption of the King's defenses.",
        "14... Nh5 15. Bc1 Qf6 16. Na4 Nxa4 17. bxa4": "I weaken my Queen-side Pawn structure, but trade off a minor piece. The objective is to remove the Queens and exploit the advantage of a Bishop against a Knight in the endgame.",
        "17... Nf4 18. Bxf4 Qxf4": "A clever little attack by Black has neutralized my long-term threat.",
        "19. Qd2 Qxd2 20. Rxd2": "I exchange Queens anyway, playing for a draw... unless my opponent blunders.",
        "20... Rad8 21. Rfd1 g6": "Now I can not only win a Pawn, but threaten to trade off a pair of Rooks in doing so.",
        "22. Rd2xd6 Rxd6 23. Rxd6": "I'm up one Pawn in a Rook endgame. With exact play, Black can hold the position, but I have a definite advantage.",
        "23... h5 24. h3 Re8 25. Rd7 Rb8": "Now I have Black on the defensive. I'm starting to like my chances.",
        "26. a5 a6 27. Kf2": "Have to centralize the King...",
        "27... b5 28. Ke3": "If I capture en passant instead, I give Black's Rook an open file and mobilize it. I feel keeping the doubled Pawn is the lesser drawback.",
        "28... c5 29. a3 b4": "Now I can undouble the Pawns without giving up a fully open file.",
        "30. axb4 cxb4 31. Rd6": "Once again, I force Black's Rook into a defensive posture.",
        "31... Ra8 32. Rb6": "Another of Black's Pawns will fall. Up 2 Pawns in a Rook endgame, it's now just a matter of time.",
        "32... b3 33. Rxb3": "If I capture with the Pawn instead, I don't get a passed Pawn on the Queen-side.",
        "33... Rc8 34. Kd3 Rc5 35. Ra3 f6 36. c4": "The passed Pawn begins its march...",
        "36... Rg5 37. Ra2": "Black attacks, and I riposte.",
        "37... f5": "This move severely restricts the mobility of Black's Rook. There will be consequences...",
        "38. e5": "I'm not about to capture and free up Black's immured Rook.",
        "38... f4 39. Ke4": "Black's only chance is to free his Rook with Rf5 followed by Rf8.",
        "39... h4 40. c5": "The Pawn marches towards the eighth rank.",
        "40... Kf7 41. Rd2": "Now Black's King is cut off from the menacing passed Pawn.",
        "41... Ke6 42. Rd5": "42...Rxg2 would be followed up with 43 Kxf4, and with TWO passed Pawns to defend, on the c and e files, Black's task would be monumental.",
        "42... Ke7": "A major blunder. Black needed to get his Rook to the eighth rank to cut off the passed Pawn.",
        "43. c6 Rh5": "Too late!",
        "44. c7": "Black resigns. If 44...Rh8, White follows up with 45 Rd8 Rxd8 46 cxd8=Q Kxd8 47 Kxf4, and Black's King-side Pawns fall. "
