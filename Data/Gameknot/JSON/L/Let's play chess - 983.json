        "1. Nf3 d5 2. c4": "The Reti opening. As in the Queen's Gambit, White is trying to remove Black's QP and thereby lessen his control over e4.",
        "2... d4": "The Main Line, but other moves are playable: 2...dxc4, 2...c6, 2...e6.",
        "3. d3 c5 4. b4": "A gambit, designed to weaken the pawn on d4, but the more conservative 4.g3 is probably better.",
        "4... cxb4 5. a3": "Hoping you will capture again and enable him to develop one of his pieces.",
        "5... Qa5": "You did right not to capture, but this gives up the pawn on d4 for nothing. Both 5...e6 and 5...b3 have yielded good results.",
        "6. Bd2": "White should have just played 6.Nxd4.",
        "6... e6": "6...Nc6, defending both pawns, is better (or you could play 6...e5).",
        "7. Nxd4": "Material is level again, but White has control of the centre and Black can't do much about it due to the absence of his c and d pawns.",
        "7... Qe5": "The best move.",
        "8. Nb5": "The simple 8.Nb3 was better. I don't think he looked far enough ahead.",
        "8... Qxa1 9. Nc7+ Kd8 10. Nxa8": "White has regained his rook, but how does he extricate his knight?",
        "10... bxa3": "Black now has a very dangerous pawn.",
        "11. Bf4": "White tries to extricate his knight, but it was more important to counter the threat of the pawn.",
        "11... Bb4+": "The immediate 11...e2 is best, but this also wins.",
        "12. Nd2 Qxd1+": "12...Qb2 was better.",
        "13. Kxd1 a2 14. Be5 Nc6 15. Bxg7": "15.Bb2 would have made it more difficult for you.",
        "15... f6 16. Nb3 Nd4": "Well played!"
