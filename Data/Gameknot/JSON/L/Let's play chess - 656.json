        "1. d4": "When this game stated we both were rather close in our ratings differential.  A few years later the difference was much larger.  Lesson?  Do not put a bunch of faith in ratings.  Just try to play your best.",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nc3 Nc6": "2...d5 might put us in a Veresov Opening, which is not a huge problem for Black.  It is one of the BPWUW openings (best player will usually win).  Not a lot of theoretical advantage to be gained for either side if I play 2...d5.  An opening that is NOT a BPWUW is the Rauzer Attack.  A well versed weaker player can take out a much higher rated opponent with either color.  Any of those long theoretical openings can yield positive results for the better prepared.  The Veresov might be that way, but I tend to think not...",
        "3. e4": "We are probably in a Nimzovitch Defense now: 1.e4 Nc6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 would be one move order besides the game's move order.  I am not a regular player of that line with either color.  I do have some books on the opening and a few more that cover some of the main lines.  Hugh Myers has the best book, but to use the contents requires study and analysis to find the best lines.",
        "3... d5": "I'm not sure if this is better than 3...d6 or 3...e5.",
        "4. e5 Ne4 5. Nxe4 dxe4 6. Be3 Bf5 7. Ne2": "White has the dark squares under control and Black has the light squares somewhat under control.",
        "7... e6 8. c3 Be7 9. Ng3 Bg6 10. Bb5 O-O 11. O-O f5": "An option is 11..f6 when Black seeks to attack the pawn chain.  Ultimately the pawn chain survives but lines are opened.  Most likely the f and/or d files.  ",
        "12. f4": "The Kings are safe, most pieces are developed and the pawn chains are locked to a degree.  White has not taken the opportunity to ruin Black's Queen side pawns, but that just means the Bishop is valued more than doubled pawns.  I might have tried 12.Bc4 as an alternative to 12.f4 or 12.Bxc6.  Not playing 12.f4 allows White to attack the pawn chain with f2-f3 later.",
        "12... Be8": "A mainly defensive move to save the Queen side pawn formation's integrity. There was not a lot of offensive potential for the Bishop on g6 either.  So maybe later it becomes an offensive move too?  ",
        "13. b4": "Ah yes...13.b4 gives me a target to work on immediately and that is not a bad thing.",
        "13... a5": "Maybe I can activate a Rook in the process.",
        "14. bxa5 Nxa5 15. Be2 b6": "The first skirmish is over.  Black did better.  White retreated to a passive post and Black has a tempo to move (...b7-b6) as a result.  Position is about even.  Neither backward pawn is under pressure.",
        "16. c4": "White has voluntarily made both my Bishops good.  White is also controlling the center and the squares adjacent to the center. Black has a piece of the center too.  \r\n",
        "16... Bf7": "Defensive again... in case of d4-d5 soon.  Black has three pieces contesting the square and White has only two attacking at present so some preparation is needed for the d4-d5 thrust.",
        "17. a4 Nb7": "The Knight's scope was increased after 17.a4, but I am worried about c4-c5.",
        "18. d5": "I failed to note that even though I had d5 covered I did not have f5 under control if ...exd5 is played.",
        "18... g6": "More defense...fixing the previously noted defensive issue asap!",
        "19. dxe6 Bxe6": "White's pawns are definitely weaker now than they were a few moves back.",
        "20. Qb3 Bc5": "Third skirmish looks to favor Black after 20...Bc5.",
        "21. Bxc5 Nxc5": "Capture with tempo.",
        "22. Qc2 Qe8": "Three threats to a4 versus two defenders.  There are five potential attackers.",
        "23. Rfd1": "White opts to ignore the threat, meaning lose the pawn and trade some pieces, but takes immediate control of the open d-file.",
        "23... Rxa4 24. Rxa4 Nxa4": "I do not agree with giving up the exchange with the a-pawn however.  You need to GAIN material (pawns) or get a definite positional plus for an exchange down trade.",
        "25. Ra1": "What file is better to control?  ",
        "25... Nc5 26. Ra7": "Attacking the backward pawn, but no other pieces can quickly apply pressure.",
        "26... Qc6 27. h4 h5 28. Nf1 Rd8 29. Kh2 Bc8 30. Nd2 Bb7": "White probably needs to keep g2 under control now.",
        "31. g3": "The pawn moved, but the square is still vital.  ",
        "31... e3": "This seems premature in retrospect.  Maybe 31...Nd3 with plans to go to e1 is a beter idea.",
        "32. Nf3": "32.Bf3 Rxd2+ 33.Qxd2 exd2 looks to be okay for Black, but no more.  ",
        "32... Rd2": "This has more impact with the White Knight on f3 instead of the Bishop.",
        "33. Nxd2": "Not the right choice unfortunately....game over. Maybe 33.Rxb7 is really no better.",
        "33... Qg2#": "And again, a few years later our ratings were vastly different.  However our play was not vastly different in this game."
