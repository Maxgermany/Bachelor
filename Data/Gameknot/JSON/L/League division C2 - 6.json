        "1. d4 g6 2. e4 Bg7 3. c4 d6 4. Nc3 Nc6": "We have reached a hybrid between Modern Defence and a Kings Indian. Black waits a while with the development of Ng8.",
        "5. Be3 e5 6. d5 Nce7 7. c5 f5": "A natural reply to Whites expansion on the Queenside. Black must counter in the centre.",
        "8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Bxd7+ Qxd7 10. Qb3 Nf6 11. Qxb7": "The Poisoned Pawn!",
        "11... O-O 12. c6 Qd8 13. f3 Rb8 14. Qxa7 Rxb2 15. Nge2 fxe4 16. fxe4 Ng4": "Black has active play and open lines (B and F) for his rooks as compensation for the lost pawn. Whites task now is to exchange as many pieces as possible and then run with the A-pawn.",
        "17. h3 Nxe3 18. Qxe3 Qb8 19. Rf1 Rxf1+ 20. Kxf1 Kh8 21. a4 Ng8 22. a5 Nf6": "This seems too slow. Blacks problem piece is the closed in Bishop on g7, so 22. - Bh6 was worth a try.",
        "23. a6 Nh5 24. a7 Qa8": "The poorest placement for a Queen that I have seen for years! Unfortunately there was no sound alternatives.",
        "25. Nd1 Rb6": "25. - Rb4 would have been more stubborn. With Whites next tactical move, it becomes clear how strong Pawns can be when they reach the 7th rank.",
        "26. Qxb6": "!!",
        "26... cxb6 27. c7": "Black resigned. After eg. 27. - Nf6 28. Rc1 Qxa7 29. cQ8  Ng8 30. Rc7, Black is lost."
