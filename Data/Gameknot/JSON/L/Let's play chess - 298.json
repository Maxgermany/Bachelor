        "9. O-O a6": "? This pawn formation doesn't for some reason feel right.",
        "10. Bf4 d5 11. cxd5 Nxd5 12. Nxd5 Qxd5": "? Why has he lined his Queen up with my bishop?",
        "13. Ne5 Qe6 14. d5 Qd6": "?? This is costing him. There is actually a tactic to win an exchange here. It's really funny, because my older bro (he has won the British Title 3 times in a row!) didn't spot this whereas I did. Can you spot it?",
        "15. Nxc6": "! The first move.",
        "15... Qg6": "Doesn't really matter where the queen goes.",
        "16. Nxe7+": "! The next move. This forks the king and queen so he has to take.",
        "16... Rxe7 17. d6": "!! The winning move. While the pawn on d6 attacks the rook on e7, My lsb is attacking his rook on a8.",
        "17... Rea7": "The best move. He's lost an exchange anyway.",
        "18. Bxa8 Rxa8 19. Rc1": "! Threatening the weak back rank.",
        "19... Bd7 20. Qd5": "! applying more pressure to the back rank.",
        "20... Ra7 21. Rc7": "!! This is now completely won for white because the pawn on d6 in unstoppable ( unless black sacrifices his queen, which would be dumb.",
        "21... Rxc7 22. dxc7 Nc6": "?? now he's making it easier.",
        "23. Qxd7 h5": "The only move",
