        "6... d6 7. Qc2 h6 8. Bd3": "Aiming for the h7-spot with my battery of Queen and light-square Bishop.",
        "8... Nbd7 9. O-O-O": "O-O-O. Long castling, my goal was a pawn storm against Blacks castled King, because of that plan it was necessary for me to castle long.",
        "9... Re8 10. e5": "Pretty good move. Opens up the b1-h7 diagonal and also chasing away a defending piece from the King\u00b4s camp.",
        "10... dxe5 11. dxe5 Ng4 12. Bh7+": "Looks like a meaningless check, but i had a plan with it.",
        "12... Kf8 13. Ne4": "It seems at a first glance that Black can win a pawn here. But he can\u00b4t, will then lose his Queen.",
        "13... Qe7": "Black is relocating his Queen to a safer spot, away from the open and potentially dangerous d-file.",
        "14. Qc3": "Now the e5-pawn must be more protected.",
        "14... h5 15. h3": "Chasing the Knight away.",

        "16... g6 17. g4": "Logic move from my perspective.",
        "17... Kg7 18. Bxg6": "That Bishop became trapped. But if my assault against Black\u00b4s King will have progress I can live with it.",
        "18... fxg6 19. gxh5 Kh8 20. Rxg6": "I got already three pawns for my Bishop and has opened up the g-file against Black`s King. Probably a good exchange.",
        "20... Qf8 21. Qe3 Nf5 22. Qg5 Re7 23. Rg1": "I\u00b4m increasing the pressure against Black\u00b4s King camp. No extremely hurry.",
        "23... Kh7 24. Nf6+ Nxf6 25. exf6": "Black\u00b4s position are worsening for every move!",
        "25... Rf7 26. Ne5": "And Black\u00b4s f-Rook is trapped.",
        "26... Bd7 27. h6": "Better to improve my position than take Black\u00b4s Rook.",
        "27... Rxf6": "??? Not so good of Black?",
