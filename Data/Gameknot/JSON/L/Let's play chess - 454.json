        "3. d3 a6 4. Bc4": "Ba4 is more in the spirit of the opening pining d7 and inviting the over-extension of black's pawns in the queen's wing, but I preferred to shift my \"attention\" to f7",

        "5. Nc3 d6 6. f4": "a Portuguese opening theme is to transpose to a king's gambit with some new tactical ideas behind it, hopping to get black off guard...",
        "6... Nc6 7. Nf3": "now the knight doesn't hamper the f pawn advance, and I can castle king side to get my rook on the f column",
        "7... Bd7 8. O-O O-O-O": "different wings castled king's and we will both be attacking on the king's wing, theoretically my king is more exposed to danger, so I have to grab the initiative and outplay my opponent",
        "9. Qd2 exf4 10. Qxf4 Ne5": "? to attack my bishop in c4, but allows me to try some tactics",
        "11. Nd5": "the idea behind black's Ne5 must be to importunate my bishop, but his queen is exposed to a zwischenzug move that allows me to get a pawn or to disturb black's pawn structure",
        "11... Nxd5": "if Qe8 or Qe6 then Nxf6 would disrupt black's pawn structure, and I could get my bishop to safety with Bb3",

        "18. Kh1": "forced",

        "24... Rdd8 25. g4": "blocks the g pawn and opens space for my king, the idea is to play Bf6 when possible, first I'll need consolidate and prevent Be3 by playing Rf3 and Kg2 to defend the rook from a possible pin by black with Rf8",
        "25... Rgf8": "? and now I can force the exchange of both rooks or even all pieces to convert in to a easily won pawn endgame",
        "26. Rxf8": "two choices for black: Rxf8 Rh8 forces the exchange of the second rook or Bxf8 Rh8 pins the bishop and Bf6 will get the exchange of the remaining pieces",

Kf7 35. h4": "leaves black a choice between :\na) gxh4 and after g5 he can't capture the f (protected) or the g pawn because then the f pawn will promote\nb) Kxf6 and after h5 he can't move his king away past from the e column or the 5th rank or my h pawn will promote, then the pawn majority in the other wing will advance to force a promotion",
