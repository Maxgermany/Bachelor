        "1. e4": "Hi everyone. Here's a rather quick game where i found a winning combination through a knight sacrifice. Its not the best game but I'm quite proud of it. here i casually just start with e4.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 f6 4. d5 Nb4": "Here black starts to go wrong allowing me to chase the knight a couple of times with tempo.",
        "5. a3 Na6 6. Be2 Nc5 7. Nc3 Nh6 8. Nxe5": "Here i started to see the combination.",
        "8... fxe5 9. Bxh6": "Doubling the pawns on h-file was essential to the outcome of the game.",
        "9... gxh6 10. d6": "Here black shouldn't have taken the pawn on d6 because if 10.cxd6......11.bh5-ke2 followed by 12.kd5-ke6.....13.qg4 mate.",
        "10... Bxd6": "Black decided to take with bishop, makes no difference.",
        "11. Bh5+": "Here its too late.",
        "11... Kf8 12. Qf3+": "And here black resigns because if 12.ke7....13.qf7 mate. or if 12.kg8.....13.qf7 mate  or 12.kg7...qf7 mate. So here's third actual game I've played here so comments and advice on what i could have done better are welcome:) Thanks for checking the annotations out."
