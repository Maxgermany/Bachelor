        "1. d4": "The search for the second weakness... this could be an appropriate tittle to this game, as early as move 12.a4! I sacrificed a pawn to block black's position and he retained that pawn advantage for most of the remaining game, black position deteriorated and he had several weak pawns that managed to defend, until I by careful maneuvering managed to push my passed pawn and dismantled black's defence, by move 34, I regained the material balance in an advantageous position and proceeded to win the resulting Q+R vs Q+R endgame, that I was able to simplify in to a won rooks plus two extra pawns endgame...

        "4... O-O 5. a3": "I try force black to abdicate from his bishop pair leaving me with mine",
        "5... Bxc3+": "and he does exchange bishop by knight and now I have a choice bxc3 and go for a center pawn majority strategy or keep an undisturbed pawn structure and recapture with the queen, i prefer the latter one",
        "6. Qxc3 b6 7. Nf3": "I'll challenge Bb7 with a king-side fianchetto, so I need to prepare it",
        "7... d6 8. g3 Bb7": "and here it is Bb7 as expected, i don't need to rush with Bg2 while my queen stands on c3 as Bxf3 has Qxf3 for reply",
        "9. b4": "so I play for more space on the queen side",
        "9... Ne4": "just annoying, no any major threat here",
        "10. Qe3 a5 11. b5": "fixing black pawn structure is my objective now, the idea is to leave black with a very cramped queen side",
        "11... d5": "he counter attacks on the center",
        "12. a4": "!? and I sacrifice a pawn to block his queen side further more",
        "12... dxc4": "expected...",
        "13. Bg2": "and finally I play Bg2 to release the queen from her defensive tasks",
        "13... Nd6": "?! I don't see the point of this move, it does defend the c4 pawn but for now I'm not interested in losing one tempo capturing it as for now it goes nowhere, it's just a debility black has to cope with...",
        "14. Ba3": "pinning the knight on the f8 rook",

        "17... Bxf3": "wow... he exchanges yet another bishop for my knight... now I should open the game if possible, also another possibility is to exchange Bxd6 allowing black to undouble his c pawns, but then playing Bc6 to pin the d7 knight with the knowledge that if black exchanges the quality I'll have a very dangerous c6 pawn",
        "18. Bxf3 e5": "black surprises me a bit he adds some tension to the center and opens up the position himself, I think it might not be bad even if he has two knights against my two bishops... he can became more active than he is now with an open position",
        "19. Bxd6": "after the recapture, black will have two weak pawns on b6 and d6, plus I get to play Bc6 to block the c column and allow me the capture of the c4 pawn",

        "22... Rxe2 23. Bd5 Rc5 24. Rxc5 bxc5": "all forced sequence, but i have doubts about the next forced queen move... the candidate moves to chose from:\na) Qf4 attacking f7 seams not to have much of a future, then what black can simply defend the f pawn, or even worst force the exchange of queens with Qf6 (aimed at f2, thus forcing the exchange)\nb) Qc3 to prevent Rb2, seams the best but also I don't see any long term plan...\nc) Qd3 to attack black's rook, this seams to me the least relevant one, as black has several good alternatives, either to back-up his rook in the open e column, or move it along the e column to an unattacked square, or even the best in my opinion move it to b2 were threatens Rb4 attacking a4 and preventing any support from behind to my passed b pawn",
        "25. Qd3": "I'll play on the possible rook exchange after Rb2 Rb1, because I have more space, and I hope to restrict black's queen, maybe latter capture the f7 pawn and expose blacks king to be able to play some tactics based upon that",

        "28. Re1": "as planed, now Nd4 is not possible...",
        "28... h6": "prophylactic getting some breathing space for the king, but not aggressive enough...",
        "29. Re2": "keeps the pin on the knight, but places the rook in a defended position, other options were:\na) Kf1 again t defend the rook\nb) Re3 were the rook would be defended by the pawn, but conditions the pawn advance",
        "29... Qd8": "black is running out or squares",
        "30. Bd5 Re8": "? now black, can't play Qb6 due to the exchange threats on e6",
        "31. Qb3 Qe7 32. b6": "and now I have b6",
        "32... Rb8": "and now I have the chance to regain back the long lost pawn in an advantageous position",
        "33. Bxe6": "now fxe6 Rxf6 threatens a discovered check, next I need to find a way to exchange queens  after which I can bring my king to the center and the advanced b pawn could be decisive, as black's rook will have to defend it...",

Qe3": "setting black a trap, if he captures Rxb6 I'll win the queen with one of two lines:\n\na) Re8+ Kh7 forced Qe4+ g6 Re7+ wins the queen, due to the absolute pin\nb) Re8+ kh7 forced Qe4+ Qg6 defended by his king, but... Rh8+! a deflection sacrifice Kxh8 forced Qxg6\n\n...yet, no matter what black replies, I'll win the d6 pawn anyway",
        "35... c4 36. Rxd6": "and here it is the d6 pawn, black still has two isolated pawns that may be under my attack, and also his king position is more exposed than that of my own king, so I may have same tactics against it latter on the game, depending on black's move I may play Qc3 aimed at both the a and the c pawn or Rc6 with the idea of playing Rc7 and aimed at the c pawn... I can also play Qe6 to force the exchange of queens if black's king and queen remain on the same diagonal, but first I need to play Kf1 to avoid the threat of promotion...",
        "36... Qf5": "threatens with perpetual on the dual squares b1-e4 and with Qb1+ attacks my b pawn with tempo",
        "37. Qd4": "defends the rook and attacks g7, maybe next Rd7 would be an option threatening mate",
        "37... Kh7 38. Rd7": "eyeing Qxg7, so black must play Qg6, although first he might interpose Qb1+ Kg2 forced and only then Qg6",
        "38... Qb1+": "as expected...",
        "39. Kg2": "only move, as Qd1 just loses a pawn... now if Qxb6 or  Rxb6 Qxg7 is mate, so I expect either Qg6 or Rg8 to defend the g pawn",
        "39... Qg6": "black needed access to the h1-a8 diagonal to have the chance of a perpetual check, with my queen eyeing e4 he only has Qg6 going back on his tracks",

        "43... Qf6": "desperate offer of exchange to play Rxf6 with tempo by an attack on my b pawn",
        "44. Qe4+": "and not Qxf6 because then black would have Rxf6 with tempo attacking my b pawn",
        "44... Qg6": "? allows me to simplify to a won rooks endgame, giving up the queen black hasn't got anymore counterplay...",
        "45. Qxg6+": "now it's fine to exchange queens because after Kxg6 I have b7 Rb8 Rc7 and I'll hold the rook on the 7th rank defending my b pawn until my king maneuvers to help on the promotion or until black decide to exchange rooks on b7 when I'll be able to push my pawn majority on the king's wing... it's just a matter of technique now and the win should not escape",

        "46... Rb8": "now again, whit the black rook tied to the defense, I'll have to enhance the second weakness on the king's wing, the pawn minority",
        "47. Rc7": "and now with black's rook tied to the defense of b8, and black's king tied to the defense of g7, I can safely bring my king to help in the promotion, even if black sacrifices his g pawn to free his king from it's defense I can exchange pawn and rook with the certain promotion on the king's wing due to the majority of pawns",
        "47... Kf6": "black needs to take his pawn from the 7th rank so he wont lose it for nothing",
        "48. Kf3": "I'll move my king to help the rook or I'll gain opposition, because black must move his g pawn or keep his king defending g7",
        "48... g6": "here it is he's moving the pawns away from immediate capture, losing one tempo",
        "49. Ke4 Ke6": "and now gains opposition but, it can be countered by Rc6+!...",
        "50. Rc6+": "... and now black has to chose the g pawn, or bring his king to the other wing to help defend the advanced b pawn, I'll just play Rb6 and bring in the king after it or capture another pawn without any loss, because after Kd7 Rxg6 Rxb7?? allows me to simplify in to a won pawn endgame with Rg7+ forcing the exchange of rooks in the next move, and the two pawn majority on the king's wing is self sufficient to win",
        "50... Kd7": "he chooses to defend the pawn with his king, so he loses another pawn for nothing...",
        "51. Rxg6 Re8+": "the more resistant as Rxb7 loses to Rg7+ forcing the exchange of rooks with a easily won pawn endgame",
        "52. Kd5": "gains opposition and black is forced to move to c7 or c8, because if Ke7 he loses to Re6+ K moves either side, Rxe8 Kxe8 b8=Q+",

        "53. Rg7+": "defending c7",
        "53... Kb8": "to block the pawn",
        "54. f4": "now I'll start pushing my pawns on the opposed wing, f4 defends e5, and consequently the 5th rank against a check by black's rook if I get to play my king along the 5th rank",
        "54... Re3": "?! dubious, although black reacts against g3 tying my rook to it's defense, in the long run it would be preferable if he placed the rook on the 2nd or first rank far away from my king and the tempo winning attack it might get from it, and now I have two strategic lines of play, to move my king to capture a5, with a detour via c6 to give a promotion threat and via b6 to give a mate threat, or to push the f pawn supported by both my king and rook, I might even lose the g pawn to a stalemate threat, so I chose the apparently safer f5, although this give black some counter-play against it...",
        "55. f5": "to move the king to the queen side via c6 and b6 would subject it to checks on the 3rd rank, plus he might get imprisoned on the a column after the capture of a5, and now I've introduced some very long conditional lines (up until move 62 in some cases)...",
        "55... Rf3": "counter play against the f pawn",
        "56. Ke4": "the move mentioned (after 54...Re3) tempo attack, now black has again to decide the counter-play strategy, to move to the a, b or c columns intending to give lateral checks, or move either to f1 or f2 to harden my king's task in attacking the h pawn",
        "56... Rf1": "also possible to move along the 3rd rank",
        "57. Ke5": "threatening to support f6 and pass  towards h4 via either f6 and f4",
        "57... Re1+": "just a little bit annoying... achieves nothing",
        "58. Kf4": "and now bypassing the f column to get the h pawn",
        "58... Ra1": "to get a pawn for a pawn also Rd1 or Rc1 was possible intending to play Rd5 or Rc5 to pin the f pawn and prevent both f6 and Kxh5",
        "59. Kg5 Rxa4": "now leaves me two options to push the f pawn or to capture the h pawn either one is winning as my f pawn is closer to promotion than black's a pawn, because it promotes with check (either by direct check f8=Q+ or discovered check by the rook after Kxb7 f8=Q+), plus is closer to the promotion square (three against four squares by black's a pawn), and my f pawn doesn't have a self blockage, that can't be withdrawn even with check with rook sacrifice on h4...",
        "60. Kxh5": "now all my king side pawns are connected",
