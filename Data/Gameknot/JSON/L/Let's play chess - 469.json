        "10. c3 Ba5": "Still no checkmate since the king can escape on f8, we need a bishop there.\n- Bishooop, are you ready?",

        "11... Bxc3+": "But wait, I'm under attack!\nI can solve this very easy by taking the bishop with the knight.\nBUT here comes my idea: if I take the bishop, he might see what's coming: checkmate and ruin my plans.\nSo I prepared a bate for him: my rook. If I give him my rook he won't hesitate to take it, and then checkmate! So I moved the king!",
