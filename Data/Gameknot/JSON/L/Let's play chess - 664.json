        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "Game started with most common opening system Ruy lopez.",
        "3... a6 4. Ba4 Nf6": "Black is attacking my pawn on e4 but we can ignore it and castle.",
        "5. O-O Nxe4": "Black has chosen to take my pawn on e4.So i have to begin with d4 to get my pawn back and planning Re1 soon maybe.",
        "6. d4 b5": "Attacking my Bishop.",
        "7. Bb3 d5": "After this move i knew where were we heading to. The variation known as \"karpov gambit\" So the game followed by dxe.",
        "8. dxe5 Be6 9. Nbd2 Nc5 10. c3 d4 11. Ng5 Qxg5": "I temporarily give up my knight because I have threating Qf3 now.",
        "12. Qf3": "Attacking Knight that s pinned and threating a fork. Black cant protect his Knight with his Bishop cause Qxf7 would be bad for black. The best move here is to castle long side.My opponent didnt play the move.",
        "12... Qd8": "He instead played Qd8. Here I didnt expect this move from my opponent and I didnt concentrate on his mistake.Here Bb3xBe6 was the best move.",
        "13. Qxc6+": "So I took Knight with a check. Now just think of if i exchanged bishops before taking the Knight with \"in between\" move. He would have to play Kf7 which is not good for black and I would just take the pawn on d4.",
        "13... Bd7": "So he defended with Bishop.",
        "14. Qf3": "I retreated my Queen to f3 threating Qxf7.",
        "14... Nxb3": "Right move. He captured my bishop. Bd6 would be bad for him I missed that chance.",
        "15. Nxb3 dxc3 16. Qxc3": "I took the pawn with queen because I didnt want to spoil my pawn structure.",
        "16... Rc8": "Preparing a pawn push.",
        "17. Be3": "I prevented c5.",
        "17... Be6": "Redeploying his bishop.",
        "18. Rad1": "So I payed d1 here. Simply developing my rook.Maybe Rfd1 would be better.",
        "18... Qe7": "His only move was Qh4. This move just loses a tempo. Because I have a chance to simplify now.I can just exchange Bishops and he will not be able to castle anymore. And his rook on h8 will need some free moves to get in to the battle.",
        "19. Bc5": "So I go for my plan.",
        "19... Qh4": "Now he plays his only move that should have played on previous move.",
        "20. Bxf8 Kxf8": "So he cant castle anymore. If he took with the rook then I would play Qc6+ followed by Nc5.",
        "21. Nc5": "Forking Bishop and his a pawn",
        "21... a5 22. Nxe6+ fxe6": "Here I thought It s time to be materialistic. So I went for his pawns.",
        "23. Qc5+": "Attacking b pawn with a check.",
        "23... Qe7": "Sure I wont trade Queens.",
        "24. Qxb5 c6": "Here I Knew what my opponent wants to do. I was materialistic again So i went after another pawn. Black is planning to play Kf7 and then He wants to release his h8 rook. I could prevent it by a move like Qd3. So after Kf7 I could play Qf3 forcing Knig to the back rank.",
        "25. Qxa5": "But I took the pawn and let him do what he wants in exchange of the pawn.",
        "25... Kf7 26. Qc3 Rhd8": "He offers rook trade. Any trades are good for me as i am up 2 pawns here.",
        "27. Rxd8 Qxd8": "He took with his Queen.",
        "28. Qf3+": "I played Qf3+ preparing Rd1 maybe.",
        "28... Kg8": "I cant play Rd1 now.Because then he can play Qa5 attacking a and e pawns. I cant protect both. So I waited.",
        "29. a3": "Protecting my pawn against Qa5 possibility.",
        "29... Qd5": "He offers Queen trade in exchange of gaining stronger pawn structure.Here I calculated it and It was winning position for me. It doesnt matter with which pawn he captures. He will only have 1 protected passed pawn but he cannot advence his pawn easily. ",
        "30. Qxd5 exd5": "So I exchanged and he captured with e pawn.",
        "31. f4": "I think b4 should be played first. But this is also ok move.I  wanted to prevent his king coming into the game.",
        "31... Kf7 32. f5": "Keeping his king away.",
