        "1. e4 c5": "Sicilian Defense.",
        "2. Nc3 Nc6 3. d3 g6 4. Nf3": "Minor mistake. If white is playing without an early d4 against the Sicilian, and they want an advantage, they should go for a system involving Nge2,g3,Bg2 and a later f4. Nf3 impedes the move f4, but the game should stil be equal.",
        "4... Bg7": "Black now adopts the system previously mentioned.",
        "5. Be3 d6": "Notice how blacks moves are all simple and the plan can be played without much analysis. Black can try for an advantage by playing e5,Nge7,0-0,h6,Be6 and f5. In contrast, white has to work for active play. The move f4 is blocked and wont be available for a while, and he is in no position to go for an initiaive on the queenside. As a result of this analysis, I prefer blacks position.",
        "6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nge7 8. a3 O-O": "Blacks plan has gone weel and f5 could be played immediately or could be held back for a couple more moves.",
        "9. b4": "White sees blacks plan and knows that he will get squashed on the kingside by f5,f4,h6,g5,and the pawn roller will force ts way through to the king. Instead he sacrafices a pawn for some activity.",
        "9... cxb4 10. axb4 Nxb4": "White can now capture the a7 pawn, but black can get in f5 and will be well on top.",
        "11. d4": "Instead white tries to go for activity.",
        "11... Bg4": "I think that h6 may have been better. Swapping off the light squared bishop leaves alot of white squared weaknesses. I think that h6 may be better. Then followed by f5 to try and gain space in the centre and kingside. The immediate f5 can be answered by Bc4  and then Ng5 which is a little awkward for black. Hg first prevents the Ng5 and after Bc4  the king can go to h7.",
        "12. d5 Bxf3 13. Bxf3 Na6 14. Nb5": "Now black has some queenside pressure.",
        "14... f5": "If white takes on a7 with the bishop, then f4 traps it and if he takes with the knight f4 forces the bishop away from the defense of the knight. Therefore the pawn on a7 is immune to capture at the moment.",
        "15. c4": "Defending the knight is a senible move.",
        "15... f4": "This could be a mistake as the white squares in the black camp become weak.",
        "16. Bd2 Qb8": "Black has to try and untangle himself. I thought that it would be best to do this by Qb8,Rd8 and Nc7.",
        "17. h3 Rd8": "Maybe h5 preventing Bg4 should be played first.",
        "18. Bg4 Nc7 19. Rc1": "Now if Nxb5 the rook gets an open file all to itself.",
        "19... a6 20. Nxc7": "The good knight gets swapped off.",
        "20... Qxc7 21. Qa4": "White still has a good position but he is still a pawn down.",
        "21... b6": "Preventing any ideas of c5.",
        "22. g3": "Now that white has a good position on the queenside he opens up another front on the kingside.",
        "22... g5": "Trying to keep the position as closed as possible.",
        "23. gxf4 gxf4 24. Be6+ Kh8": "White is hoping for a tactic due to the fact that the black kings lack of squares. It is difficult for white to engineer this however.",
        "25. f3": "This looks a little slow. Better would be Kh1 and doubling rooks on the g-file.",
        "25... Qc5+": "This makes an annoying passed pawn on the queenside.",
        "26. Kh1 b5 27. cxb5 Qxb5 28. Qd1": "Keeping the queens on is the best continuation.",
        "28... a5": "Distracting white from his atack on the kingside with a threatening passed pawn.",
        "29. Rg1": "This may be too late.",
        "29... Bf6": "This seems to cover all the threats.",
        "30. Rc7 Ng6": "Fortifying the kingside.",
        "31. Qf1": "Allowing the queens to be swapped gives away much of whites potential.",
        "31... Qxf1": "Black is quick to swap as it makes the win easier.",
        "32. Rxf1 a4 33. Bb4": "White need to blockade the pawn.",
        "33... Rab8": "Although black will be able to promote it with fairly accurate play.",
        "34. Ba5 Rb5 35. Bc3 Rb3 36. Ba5 a3 37. Rf7 Rf8 38. Rd7 a2 39. Rc7": "Forced as the pawn is too close to the queening square to be ignored.",
        "39... Rb1 40. Rcc1": "Again forced.",
        "40... Rfb8": "With the threat of Rxc1,Rxc1 and Rb1",
        "41. Bc3": "Necessary to guard the a1 square.",
        "41... Rb8b3 42. Ba1 Bd8": "The introduction of the bishop to the attack is the move that seals the win.",
        "43. Kg2 Nh4+": "Winning a pawn and the game.",
        "44. Kf2 Rxf3+ 45. Ke2 Rxf1 46. Rxf1 f3+": "Tactic that wins the rook.",
        "47. Kf2 Bb6+ 48. Kg3 Rxf1 49. Bc3 Bd4": "Now the pawn will queen.",
