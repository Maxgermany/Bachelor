        "3... g6": "I usually fianchetto the B on g7, but it is cumbersome and the game is often difficult to defend.",
        "4. Nf3 Bf5 5. c4 Bg7 6. Nc3 Bg4": "Don't know if this is best, but trading QB for KN is not all bad.",

        "12... O-O 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. b4 Qd7 15. Rab1 Nf5": "I gain a tempo since d4 is loose.",
        "16. Qf4 h6": "Another tempo.",
        "17. Bf6 g5": "Yet another tempo.  It probably begins to be annoying, but it also helps to uncoordinate the other pieces.",
        "18. Qg4 Bxf6 19. exf6 Qd8": "I am going to sneak a pawn--there is no way for Black to defend it.",

        "26. Rb3": "No such luck.",
        "26... Rcb8": "I realized that I might have more play if I exchange his good R.",
        "27. Nb5 a6 28. Nc7 Rxb3 29. axb3 Rb8": "Now maybe my R is a little better than his, and my N is more central.",
        "30. Rf4 Rxb3 31. g4 Nd6 32. Nxa6 Rxh3": "I managed to sneak another pawn.",
        "33. Nc5 Kg6 34. Kg2 Rh4 35. Nd3 Kg5 36. Kg3": "I was not sure of the best way to proceed in these close quarters.",
        "36... f5 37. Ne5 Ne4+ 38. Kf3 Rh3+": "This forces his R loose and gives me the chance to sneak anothe pawn in a few moves.",
        "39. Kg2 Kxf4 40. Kxh3 Nf2+": "A third pawn is going to disappear and Black's task becomes impossible."
