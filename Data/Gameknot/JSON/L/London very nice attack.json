        "5... Bd6 6. Ne5": "So, this was a simple blunder. A little one, of course, but a blunder. Nevertheless...",
        "6... Nxd4 7. e3 Bxe5": "My plan to take in e5 with a pawn, one of the keys of this opening, fails... ",
        "8. Bxe5 Nf5": "The simple Nf6 is better, but I cannot blame him for not seeing what was coming on...",
        "9. g4": "Again, Nh4 looks better, but g5 follows, and then the queen goes out... ",
        "9... Nd6 10. g5": "Where does this nasty pawn go?",
        "10... Nfe4": "Ok, now I had to choose between h4, f4, or Nf3. Neither look bad... but I like to be aggressive, and after some calculation...",
        "11. Bxg7 Rg8 12. Bh6 Nxg5": "Never allow such a pin!",
        "13. Rg1": "Now it starts to be really tactic. One of the funniest variations I found was the following. \n\n13. ...        Rg6\n14. Qh5\tNd6-e4\n15. o-o-o\tNxf2\n16. Rxg5\tNxd1\n17.

        "13... Rg6 14. Qh5": "Here it goes, the dangerous queen. ",
        "14... Nde4 15. O-O-O": "Risking again. A quiet way to play was to protect f2 (Rg2... looks weird), or h4 or f4... but I adore tactics, and if a sacrifice is possible, I do it. ",
        "15... Qf6": "Oh, playing hard... now I have to change my bishop, and all seems to stay calm, with a pawn less. Not quite. ",
        "16. Bxg5 Nxg5": "A half blunder, since it allows my bishop to come into the game aggressively.",
        "17. Bd3 Rg7 18. f4": "This move makes me recover the pawn, but no only this. ",
        "18... Ne4 19. Nxe4 dxe4 20. Bxe4": "It opens the 5\u00ba row to my queen's action, and bishop and rook are perfectly placed for a mortal attack. Black worry about his h pawn...",

        "24... Kf6 25. Qe5+": "...and the game is over. Black can struggle more, and white can allow himself not to take the black's queen, with: \n\n25. ... Ke7 \n26. Qc7+, Kf6 \n27.

        "25... Kg6": "The shortest way to lose, but... what else?\n\nTo say the truth: my opponent was trapped in a tactics difficult to see, and I got it by chance. One of those games in which a \"little\" mistake leads to major material loss. ",
