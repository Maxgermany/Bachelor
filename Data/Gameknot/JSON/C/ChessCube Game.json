        "1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3": "The time control on this game was 20 minutes to each player.  I have seen this move in several blitz games, but I really do not know what the 'proper' response is.  He is offering free pawns for easy development and attacking chances.  My own experience suggests that taking the second and third pawn offered is dangerous.",
        "3... d5": "This was probably unwise, but I wanted to take him out of his known system.",
        "4. Qxd4 Nf6 5. exd5 Qxd5 6. Qxd5": "Perhaps he feared the isolated queen pawn.",
        "6... Nxd5 7. h3 Bf5 8. Na3 e6 9. Nb5 Nc6 10. c4 Bb4+ 11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 12. Kxd2 O-O-O 13. cxd5 Rxd5+ 14. Ke3": "Better was Ke8 when continued harrassment by the rook is met by white development.",
        "14... Re5+ 15. Kd2 Rd8+": "And white resigns with plenty of clock time left.  I spent a little time with the puzzle composer and it is difficult to see if Black is in a forced losing position.  By most standards even if White steps out of the attack, the next 5-10 moves will not be fun for him."
