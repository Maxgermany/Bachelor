        "1. e4": "A standard opener for me. It helps get my bishop and queen out.",
        "1... d5": "Not what I expected...",
        "2. Nc3": "I am now both attacking Black's pawn at d5 and defending mine at e4.",
        "2... dxe4": "Again, not what I expected. I can now, however, take Black's pawn at e4.",
        "3. Nxe4": "Now I set the score straight.",
        "3... f6": "I don't see how this move helps the computer. It actually helps me now.",
        "4. Qh5+": "Haha... CHECK!",
        "4... g6": "They now are trying to take my queen and block my attack on the King, I guess.",
        "5. Qf3": "I thought that a retreat to here would be best, as a retreat to g4 could leave my queen open to a bishop.",
        "5... Bh6": "I assume this is an attempt at a pin on my bishop at c1 and my pawn at d2.",
        "6. d3": "This was a win/draw move for me. Either the bishop would not move and I could take it, or he would take my bishop and I could capture it with my rook.",
        "6... g5": "I guess this was a draw move. I can't capture his bishop now.",
        "7. Be3": "I'm still going to move my bishop at c1 to get it out on the board and allow queenside castling.",
        "7... Na6 8. O-O-O": "Yay for castling!",
        "8... c6 9. Qh5+": "Yay for check! (again!) Notice how this would also be a fork with the bishop at h6 if not for the knight at g8.",
        "9... Kd7": "Now they can't castle! Go me!",
        "10. Qg4+": "Now I'm going to try to set up for checkmate.",
        "10... e6": "Well, they did the thing I didn't want them to do. Now their king has better mobility. Oh well.",
        "11. d4 f5": "Uh-oh... fork.",
        "12. Qh5": "I'll save my queen.",
        "12... fxe4": "Great. I'm 3 points behind.",
        "13. h4 b5 14. hxg5": "CAPTURE! Now I'm only 2 points behind.",
        "14... Bf8": "Perfect. Just what I wanted.",
        "15. Qf7+": "This might have been a fork if not for Black's queen.",
        "15... Ne7": "Hmmf. I hate blocks.",
        "16. Bf4": "Setting up for checkmate...",
        "16... h6 17. d5 exd5": "Perfect...",
        "18. g3 h5 19. Bh3#": "Checkmate! :) It took me 19 moves to checkmate."
