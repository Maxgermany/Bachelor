        "1. e4": "A very short game where black gets checkmated in just 13 moves. An entertaining game none the less .",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4": "The scotch game. It leads to open positions and is somewhat more favorable to white, although black can equalize without too much difficulty too -- i guess.",
        "3... Nxd4 4. Nxd4": "Black decides to exchange knights and a pawn. This position generally gives an advantage to white in development.",
        "4... exd4 5. Qxd4": "Now white has a developed queen and control of the center. Black has zero development and would like to drive away the white queen. The crucial queen-side black knight that could have driven her away has already been sacrificed though.",
        "5... c5": "This could be the first blunder from black ? \n\nAdvancing the c pawn seems too aggressive too soon ? \n\n",
        "6. Qe5+": "White could have retreated the queen to a more defensive spot -- white however decides to take a more agressive square.\n\nThe only way to defend the king for black would be with the bishop/knight or with the queen. I would have been hesitant to trade queens so defending with queen might have been a good idea.",
        "6... Ne7 7. Na3": "That seems to be a very odd position to develop the white knight. I was thinking of putting my knight on the d6 square ( since the attack pawns on the c and e file did not threaten d6 ) and hence took this route for my knight.",
        "7... d6": "Black now wants to drive away the white queen but she has other ideas.",
        "8. Bb5+": "This is a good move for white. The only way to protect the king would be with its own black bishop.\n\nWhite has taken the opportunity to advance even more of its important pieces and increased the pressure on the black queen.",
        "8... Bd7": "As expected.",
        "9. Nc4": "Now another move that might seems surprising. I found this move as an after-thought and considered it a really cool move to try.\n\nI was hoping for black to take my queen (bxe5. Nc6#) and affect a real rare checkmate for the black king with nowhere to move. ",
        "9... Qc7": "Black saw through my plans though and did not take my queen. :).\n",
        "10. Nxd6+": "Nxd6+ to check the king and also for a discovered threat to the black queen. I had to re-inforce my queen though.",
        "10... Kd8 11. Bf4": "The bishop adds more weight to the queen threat and gives rise to checkmate chances.",
        "11... Ng6": "Clearly a blunder from black.",
        "12. Nxf7+": "Black resigns at move 12 -- as the next move was a lucky 13 move checkmate with 13. Kc8, Qc7#"
