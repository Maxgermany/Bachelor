        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5": "this is the Budapest counter gambit. I also play 2...c5 3.d5 b5, the Benko gambit. Both of these give black durable counterplay. The benko gambit gives black long term queenside pressure and this gives black good piece activity.",
        "3. dxe5": "accepted. This is the only real chance at the advantage for white.",
        "3... Ng4 4. Nf3 Bc5": "GM Alterman states that this is forced if black wants to have a good game with good piece activity and initiative. This attacks f2.",
        "5. e3": "white obviously will not like to block his c1 bishop, but it can be fianchettoed later in the game.",
        "5... Nc6": "just developing.",
        "6. e6": "This just gives the pawn without a fight. I think black should stand better after this, with white's center control weakened and blacks active pieces. ",
        "6... fxe6 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O b6": "Preparing a fianchetto TO pressure the kingside.",
        "9. Nc3 Bb7 10. h3 Nge5 11. Ne4": "A mistake which loses. Can you see what I played next? If my next move is not the best,tell me why you think so.",
        "11... Nxf3+": "with check",
        "12. Bxf3": "I never considered the g pawn recapture, which doesn't seem so bad when white can play Kh1 and Rg1 sometime. But in that line, I think black retains advantage. ",
        "12... Ne5 13. b3 Nxf3+ 14. gxf3 Bxe4": "I played this move rather quickly, because it seemed that black would gain an advantage after fxe4 Qh4.\nwith multiple threats. It also seemed Rook takes f6 wins some material involving the a1 rook and white king, but I chose this.",
        "15. fxe4 Qh4 16. Kh2": "now I calculated that Rxf2+ goes into a winning endgame.",
        "16... Rxf2+ 17. Rxf2 Qxf2+ 18. Kh1 Bd6": "threat:Qh2mate",
        "19. Qg1": "forced",
        "19... Rf8": "this was the target position. I spent time analyzing the size of my advantage after Q takes f2, rook takes f2, and I am up a pawn and will win more, because the c1 bishop cannot move, and the king cannot stop the rook and the bishop from winning more pawns. Instead, white's next moves made all my analysis completely worthless.",
        "20. e5": "desperation",
        "20... Bxe5 21. e4 Qf3+": "I could take the rook, but this is stronger.",
        "22. Qg2 Qd1+ 23. Qg1 Rf1 24. Bb2 Qf3#": "mate."
