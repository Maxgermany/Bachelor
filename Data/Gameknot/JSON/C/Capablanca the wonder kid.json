Ng5": "This variation is called the Algueire gambit witch white scarifies a piece for quick development of all of his Pisces , this scarifies is incorrect however Cuba's champion hoped that the young talented kid wont find the right way to defend or the acceptable continuations of these complications witch was made as the result of that piece scarifies . Capablanca indeed didn't knew these continuation however he find the best moves on the board better than everything that was familiar at the time .",
        "6... h6 7. Nxf7 Kxf7 8. d4 d5": "8...d5  is better than 8...d6  because of the open diagonal f1-a6 witch white can use to attack blacks king for example , 8...d6.9.Bxf4-Bg7.10.Bc4+ with strong attack . ",
        "9. exd5 Qe7+ 10. Kf2 g3+ 11. Kg1": "Now black scarifies a piece back for opening the diagonal a7-g1 and with the help of the black's g3 pawn , black can create some unpleasant mate threats .",

        "17. Be2 Bxd4+ 18. cxd4 Rxd4 19. b3": "white was counting on the development of his DSB on b2 and trap one of the rooks and win the exchange , but blacks conclusions was much deeper .",
        "19... Nf6 20. Bb2 Rd2 21. Bh5+ Nxh5": "good move , black  sucrifiesing an exchange will bring crushing attack on the white king.",
        "22. Bxh8 f3": "the threat is 22...f2+.23.Kf1-Bf5 followed by Bd3# with no defence , therefore white must take another pawn , and after 23...Nf4 it seems that white cant hod on for along .",
