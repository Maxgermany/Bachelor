        "1... Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 c6": "This wasn't the best move, but just to take you out of book.  Better move would be any of a few Bishop moves, such as a fianchetto, Bb4, etc.  This is not a suicidal move, just not the best.\n",
        "5. Bg2 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. Bf4 d5 8. Nbd2 Nbd7 9. Re1 Nh5 10. Be3 Nhf6 11. Bg5 Bb7 12. cxd5 cxd5 13. Rc1 h6 14. Bf4 Rc8 15. Qa4 a6 16. Nb3 Nb8 17. Rxc8": "I think this is the turning point in the game.  My rule is to never initiate a trade without a good reason.  I can't read your mind, so you may have had a good reason that just didn't work out. But from the time you gave me control over this file, you will note that you lose the use of your Queen for the rest of the game.",

        "26... Qa7 27. e3 g5 28. Be5 Ng4 29. Bh3": "Bh3 only forces me to do what I wanted, to trade a weak Knight for a strong Bishop.  Bf1 would have at least put a small pressure on b5.",
        "29... Nxe5 30. dxe5 d4 31. e4": "This move surrenders control to me and misses a potential attack.  a3 chases my Knight and if followed with Bxe6, Qg6+, Qxh6+, etc. has possibilities.  But notice, that the Queen cannot make that move because of this move e4 which blocks the Queen's path.",
        "31... Qb8": "Continued pressure.",
        "32. a3": "Too late.",
        "32... Na6 33. f4 b4 34. Bf1": "a4 doesn't stop the attack but, would slightly slow it.  After this move it is over.  BxN is no threat to my attack.  Everything follows from here and doesn't matter any more.",
