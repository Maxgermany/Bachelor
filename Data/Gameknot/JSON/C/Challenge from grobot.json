        "1. e4": " Gotta love king pawn opening, it opens up two positional promotion routes for the queen and bishop.\n",
        "1... e5": "Copycat...",
        "2. Nf3": "Maintaining the tempo, and making the opponent respond to my move",
        "2... f6": "Classic black defence.",
        "3. d4": "Queen pawn follow up allows for the removal of the e5 pawn, via a pawn for pawn trade",
        "3... Bd6": "Bishop maintains the tension in the middle four squares",
        "4. Nc3": "Classic attack, the knight allows for a wide variation of attacks ",
        "4... c5": "Black is directly challenging the centre four squares but is at a disadvantage, the pawns only attack the black squares and there are limited follow on options with blacks setup",
        "5. dxc5": "Pawn takes pawn to attack the bishop with both the pawn and the queen.",
        "5... Bxc5": "Bishop makes only obvious move. Opens black up to a structural weakness as no pawns can threaten d5",
        "6. Nd5": "Knight promotion to d5 results in a long term structural problem for black.",
        "6... Qa5+": "A wasted move, that allows for the promotion of my bishop to directly threaten the queen, causing a temporal advantage",
        "7. Bd2": "Black is now completely reactive ",
        "7... Qa4": "This move surprised me. As a result the d5 knight has a choice, push forward for the fork or withdraw to c3 to threaten the queen and protect the e4 pawn and king.",
        "8. Nc3": "DEFENCE DEFENCE DEFENCE... Structural defence to protect my centre and left side (a side)",
        "8... Qc6": "Queen withdraws, maintaining attack on e4, but with the pawn on e6 this is a non event threat, if black's next move was pawn to f5 it would change the tempo of the game. It would cause the re-direction of effort from aiming at the A side to aiming at the more vulnerable H side, kings weak side.",
        "9. Bd3": "Bishop promotion combines the queen thru to bishop synergies. Allows for king side castle and protect f2 with the king and rook.",
        "9... b5": "I don't see the point of this move.... It doesn't allow for new lines of attack or threaten me to require a response. This in context with the ability to castle king side means minimal effect",
        "10. Nd5": "Returning knight to d5, limits movement of black and reopens the c7 fork. Need to wait for pawn push to d6, this enables queen to e2. To drive a pin from b5 through the queen onto the king.",
        "10... a6": "The possible pin is mitigated by the pawn to a6, bishop to b4 threatens the black c5 bishop, while being covered by the d5 knight. Three obvious moves 1- black Bishop takes the b4 bishop 2- the a pawn is moved forward to move the white bishop 3 - d pawn move to support the black bishop",
        "11. Bb4": "Wait for the response.   :)",
        "11... d6": "Opportunity to setup the queen-king pin, promote my queen, and also protect from the attack on f2, or setup knight to get behind the h-side pawn line",
        "12. Nh4": "Push knight forward to increase the complexity of the attack....",
        "12... a5": "A pawn to move my bishop.... Promote queen to enable the pin, sacrifice bishop for the queen.",
        "13. Qe2": "Execute!!!!",
        "13... axb4": "Trap sprung!!",
        "14. Bxb5": "SURPRISE!!! ",
        "14... Bg4": "Temporal advantage, take queen then take bishop",
        "15. Bxc6+": "Bazinga!\nExpected move knight takes my bishop. Then my queen will take the g4 bishop.",
        "15... Nxc6 16. Qxg4": "Queen takes knight, blocks possible castle to a side. Expected move pawn f6 to f5 to attack the queen and open up the knight.",
        "16... Rd8": "Block in h side, also enables the queen to attack the g7 pawn.",
        "17. Nf5 h5": "Queen to g6 or to g7\nG6- check, k to d7, q to g7 check either knight to e7 or king to c8.\nG7- allows for Q to press h8 then h7",
