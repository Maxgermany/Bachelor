    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "i'm fairly unfarmiliar with queens pawn games",
        "1... d5 2. e4": "according to the database, this is the \"blackmar gambit\" ",
        "2... dxe4": "I see no reason not to take the pawn so.... ",
        "3. Nc3 Nf6": "main line from the database is C6 ...  but i think i can keep the pawn so why not try....  defending the pawn while developing kingside knight",
        "4. f3 exf3 5. Nxf3": "i'm behind a fair amount on development and white has a  lot more active pieces than me ,  but i'm up a pawn",
        "5... Bg4 6. h3 Bh5": "i debated playing Bxf3 but i didn't want to develop his queen for him",
        "7. Be3": "g4 is the main continuation and would have forced me to play bg6... we're outside the games DB now (as only one GK game 1500 opponents has reached this position)",
        "7... e6 8. Bd3": "here white has a commanding lead in development but is still down a pawn",
        "8... Nc6 9. Ne4": "i'm not quite sure where he is going with this... shouldn't he unpin his queen or something?",
        "9... Bxf3": "i eliminate one of the defenders of the d4 pawn ",
        "10. Qxf3": "as i was hoping he took my piece with his queen not with his pawn as i intend to open the D file and my queen is in position on it",
        "10... Nxe4": "i am hoping to castle kingside so i don't want to trade knights on f6 after moving my queen because this would double pawns... this to me is more important than immediatly taking the D pawn because i'm a pawn up and behind on development",
        "11. Bxe4": "a mistake.? ... Qxe4 guards the pawn but this move attacks the knight and the pawn on B7 behind it.... ",
        "11... Nxd4 12. Bxd4": "Forced as any other move either loses the queen and / or fails to capture the knight",
        "12... Qxd4 13. Rd1": "i think that Bc6 would have been a strong move... or mabye Bxb7",
        "13... Qxb2": "my only real option here seemed to be to take the pawn",
        "14. Bxb7": "(had he played Bxb7 the move before he could have played Qc6 )",
        "14... Rd8": "now i sacrifice the ability to castle in order to take a rook off the board and move my king to a square where it can't be attacked by his bishop",
        "15. Rxd8+": "Qc6! seems better, possibly even winning in some continuations, and at least enough to force a 3 repitition draw with the threat of the loss of the rook... 15.Qc6 Ke7.... 16QC5  Kf6 (because Ke8 loses to Bc6!) 17 QF2 Ke7 18 Qc5 Kf6",
        "15... Kxd8 16. O-O Bc5+": "i decided to get the bishop out of the way of my rook and don't waste time due to the check on his king ",
        "17. Kh1 f6": "i opted not to play Qxc2 or Qxa2 because i didn't want to risk exposing my king any further",
        "18. Qb3": "an unexpected move.... i'm two pawns up, is it worth your queen to connect your pawns?",
        "18... Qxb3 19. axb3 Ke7": "and we approach the final phase of the game with my king in much better position centralized than his over in the corner",
        "20. Bc6": "i don't know where he was going with this",
        "20... Rd8": "i claim the only fully open file",
        "21. Be4": "i'm still not sure where he is going with this... perhaps he wants me to play f5 and place my pawns on the white squares",
        "21... h5 22. g4": "and we exchange another pawn",
        "22... hxg4 23. hxg4 g5 24. Kg2 Rd2+": "i want to position my rook at the base of his pawn chain and get to without wasting a move because i check his king as well ",
        "25. Kh3": "i don't know where he was going with this move... Kf3 seems much more sound but perhaps he was trying to keep the f file half open for his rook",
        "25... Bd6": "Bd6! threatens mate.... by doing so it traps both his king and rook away from the action while my bishop and rook still occupy good positions ",
        "26. Rh1": "forced as any other move leads to Rh2#",
        "26... Bf4": "i don't want to free his king as i advance my passed pawn",
        "27. Bd3": "his only option is to shuffle between these spaces",
        "27... e5 28. Bf5 Kd6 29. Be4 a5": "his bishop has to leave e5 which allows me to play Kd5, then e4.  This would eventually lead to queening my E pawn... Here my opponent resigned... Thanks for the game Kleos"
