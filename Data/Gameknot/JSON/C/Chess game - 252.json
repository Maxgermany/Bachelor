        "10. O-O-O Re8": "? A pointless move. Black should be mobilizing his Q-side.",
        "11. h4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Bd7 13. h5 Rc8 14. Bh6 Bh8": "Black is now so woefully behind in his Q-side attack that he can only really prolong the inevitable.",
        "15. hxg6 hxg6 16. Bg5 Nc4 17. Qf2": "Interesting also would have been Rxh8+. The move in the game is slightly more conservative.",
        "17... Nxb2 18. Qh4": "Material is hardly what White is after. Taking the knight would have, however, been almost entirely safe.",
        "18... Bg7 19. Bh6 Nh5": "Bh8 is also possible.",
        "20. Bxg7 Kxg7 21. g4 Rxc3": "? Far better was the simple Nf6, but that too loses to 22.Nd5",
        "22. gxh5 Rh8 23. h6+ Kh7 24. Bxf7": "Black resigned."
