        "2. Nf3": "<<<(Taufiq) Yes, I've allready looked to the Game DB, and I find it very helpfull !\n\nNow, the attack with my horse forces you to cover your e-pawn.. >>>",
        "2... Nc6": "<<<(Tugger) Indeed... i'm not comfortable playing Nf6 and attacking your e-pawn too, and a gambit isn't really appropriate! i might look into f5 in the future, i like gambits! they can provide huge development advantages that far outweigh the pawn loss... for now though i'll stick with Nc6...>>>\n\nof course, i meant the gambit wasn't appropriate for black, Nf6 could encourage the gambit (Nxf7) for white, which i play often.",

        "3... Nf6": "four knights...\n\n<<<(Tugger) I believe it is best for black to ensure there is a knight-balance, ie my position would be weaker if you had more knights developed early on... so Nf6 is the natural move... your opening is sound as you are still forcing me to respond, as opposed to me making you play...>>>",

        "4... Nd4": "i'm pretty sure this move is sound. i have abandoned my pawn on e5, but this would be a temporary loss, as 5... Qe7 attacks knight and exerts yet more pressure on the e4 pawn, or i could even reclaim the e4 pawn immediately, since my knight on d4 stops white pinning the knight (and yes, despite white's knight on e5, my knight would be pinned if white's queen safely occupied e2, since the discovered check Nc6  would be devastating). \n\n<<<(Tugger) Now, although this move loses the protection of my e-pawn, it would most certainly be a temporary loss, i would reclaim the pawn within a couple more moves, while gaining a positional advantage, at least i think... i also attack your bishop and knight, and i have brought my knight into a central position. you can of course take him, but then when i reclaim, your other knight is attacked... while this does not win any material, it hands the initative to me... i can now begin to build up a counter-attack\u2026>>>",

I'll protect my f-knight again with my bishop..>>>\n\n4... a6 would be a blunder, since the bishop/knight trade would leave black a pawn down and an inferior pawn structure. and white moving his bishop twice in the opening means black has a development advantage.",
        "5... Nxf3+": "<<<(Tugger) It was too late to play a6, as this is a prevention move... after Bxc6, i have to reclaim with a pawn, messing up my structure... and you would be able to claim my e-pawn for free... a clear advantage to you...\n\nnow i have the choice out of bishop and knight... normally, i'd go bishop, but this would simply aid your development after the queen takes... Nxf3  will obviously respond Bxf3... while you may have more pieces developed, i will still be able to hold the initiative with 6. Bb4, which threatens your e-pawn and develops my bishop...>>>",

Bb4 does not threaten your e-pawn, as the bishop now protects it as well as the knight... therefore, instead i shall play Bc5, as this gains the g1-a7 diagonal before you can develop your black bishop...>>>\n\njust one of the many times i'll look a bit silly, but that's what was said, and it aids the insight to the game to see what was discussed at the time.",

O-O c6": "i felt this was more important than castling myself, since there is no threat yet which demands it. white controlled d5, and i didn't want the knight moving in. and since my b8 knight has developed and been traded, c6 does not hamper any future development. \n\n<<<(Tugger) You have control over d5, so to gain some control there myself, in particular prevent the knight moving in, in feel c6 is more important than castling now... since my queenside knight has been traded already, this does not hamper development as c6 sometimes can...>>>",

        "10... Bxe3": "<<<(Tugger) Hmm... the only problem with that move is when i take the bishop, you must reclaim with your pawn. this will cause a double up on the e-file, which could be a crucial disadvantage in the endgame. i could consider myself 'half a pawn' up. i think maybe a stronger move would have been Re1, followed by Be3... this way you would be able to reclaim with the rook instead. on the plus side, you will open up the f-file for your rook. and, of course, you have closed the diagonal.>>>",

        "13. b3": "<<<(Taufiq) Yup, removing my double pawns, was the meaning of that move.. But now, in this fase of the game, I don't know what to do now.. :( My idea was to make a diagonal with the c2, b3 and a4-pawns...>>>",
        "13... b5": "<<<(Tugger) Yes, this has become a very tight position... i'm struggling to find a move too... it would be best for me to develop my last piece before trying to manouvre pieces for better position... i was going to play Be6, but d5 would give me problems, so i must play b6 or b5 to develop the bishop... b5 seems best as it threatens b4 if you advance your pawn on a3, this would give your knight less room to move and he would no longer control the centre... also i have the option of developing the bishop to a6, which threatens a developed attack on your rook while stabbing the knight with a pawn, that would lose you material, but it's easily defended, so it might not feel there is any gain by playing it... after Bb7 i will probably look at moving my queen, most likely to c7, then placing my rook on the same file as your queen, the good old x-ray attack... but of course this depends on your moves...>>>",
        "14. dxe5": "<<<(Taufiq) If you re-capture my pawn with your d-pawn, you're opening a line for queens-exchange..>>>",
        "14... dxe5": "<<<(Tugger) I suspected as much... it suits me fine, we're still level on material and i have a slightly superior pawn structure... we will both have one white bishop and a knight each, along with the rooks, so it should make for a close endgame... my plan should you take the queen will now be to trade off as many pieces as possible while attempting to maintian my pawn shape... if we took all the pieces bar the pawns and kings off the board now, i'd be favourite as you can only offer protection to your e pawns with your king, which needs to be mobile in an endgame, while my king can go roaming around the board looking for weak pawns... your plan should be to try and force me to double up pawns, or win a pawn outright...>>>",
        "15. Qxd8": "not sure if this is poor play or not... i'm happy to encourage endgame, as my pawn structure is superior, so the queen trade suits me...\n\n<<<(Taufiq) Ok, I'll try to remember your advice :)>>>",

        "17... Bg4": "and the bishop trade forced, though his g-pawn will move to the f-file, offering support to his doubled pawns, thus strengthening his position...\n\n<<<(Tugger) I don't think it was the best tactic, mainly because i can now also force the bishop trade, but at least you are limiting my attacking options too... it probably increases the chance of a draw, but certainly decreases the chance of you winning... it will be harder to win pawns now...>>>",

        "18... Bxf3": "<<<(Tugger) That's an excellent move... not only do you threaten a pawn, you also threaten Rxf6, which would win bishop and knight for rook, a good trade for you... this forces me to take your bishop, which will mean your e-pawns will have some support, freeing up your king in an endgame... there is still a weakness in your pawn structure, but not as much as there was... then you gain a tempo as i have to cover my pawn with the rook... like i say, an excellent move...>>>",

        "23... Nxe3": "? with the benfit of hindsight, i think Nxe5 would've been stronger, but i was greedy and thought i would take the lead...\n\n<<<(Tugger) Yeah, Kg3 was definitely best...\n\nafter good analysis, you're not yet on the verge of collapse, but i certainly have the stronger position now... those pawns on the e-file are a big problem for you... your biggest concern in endgame is the h g pawn push, with only one pawn defending... made possible due to your f-pawn moving onto the e file... and for you, i guess the best thing you can do is put pressure on my b c pawns, though i'm not sure you'll be able to succeed in winning back the pawn, i should be able to hold you off and pressure your e-pawns... you must avoid trading pieces, too... once you've lost one more, i can look at the pawn push...>>>",

Na2 was inneffective after Nxc2, and then your knight would've been out of harms way... Ne2 would've been ok in regards to extra defence against the pawn rush later, but i think you would be better off trying to hound a pawn off me with the knight and rook...>>>",

        "27. Nd7+ Ke7": "<<<(Tugger) Makes more sense to bring my king into the thick of it... threaten the knight in the process... while i have the advantage still, i have to be extremely careful now we're at endgame, as one mistake can easily lose a game... my advantage is not sufficient to win easily...>>>",

Ke2 or Kc2...\n\nbut Ke2 will lose too... why...?\n\n47. Ke2? Kxe4\n\n48. Kd1 Kd3\n\n49. Kc1 c2!\n\n50. Kb2 Kd2\n\nand now the promotion square is covered... note when i advanced my pawn, i did NOT place you in check... this is the difference... the pawn forced your king OFF the promotion square... if i ckeck you when i advance, then you can move ONTO the promotion square... then the only square i can move my king to maintain support for the pawn is directly underneath on c3... but then what would you move if i played that...? the answer... nothing... it is stalemate...\n\nso...\n\n47. Kc2! Kxe4\n\nagain, you need to be very careful... it is vital you do not allow my king to get on d2, as this will allow me to promote... and you need to make sure i do not advance my pawn UNLESS i ckeck you in the process, or else my king will get to d2... so again you have just one m",

Kd3 was one option, but i have gone for the more tactical c2!, as it is a perfect exapmle of a pawn sac winning an endgame... it will demonstrate the strength of the king in endgame... i feel there is a little more to learn this way...\n\n.\n\nhow well do you finish your opponent off when you have a won game...? i assume you have no problems with Q vs K, or R vs K, but if you would like, i will be happy to continue to mate or at least mate next move before drawing this off and concluding our coaching game... i will promote to rook or queen, as you desire... otherwise, i will offer the draw after promotion...>>>",
