        "1. Nf3": "I've analysed this game in two parts. The first my feelings and observations during and just after  the game and in the second part engine assisted annotations(EA).",
        "1... d6 2. d4 Bg4": "The Wade variation an opening in which my opponent is expert in.",
        "3. e4": "3.c4 is a major alternative line which after3.... Bxf3 4. exf3 leads to an imbalance in the position. Though theory and the silicon monster give white a reasonable plus my opponent has too often clawed his way to an advantage in the middlegame/endgame where his q-side majority has the final say.",
        "3... e6": "book and I believe Svidler may have played it but I feel it just hands white the add.I prefer 3.....Nbd7 preparing either c4 or e4",
        "4. h3": "Putting the question to the Bishop though I didn't expect the exchange of minor pieces. The move is useful as it prepares a \"luft\" for the King and discourages black from playing Ng4",
        "4... Bh5 5. Nc3 c6 6. d5": "Staking a claim for central space. My data base gives 6.g4 6.Be2 6.Bf4 as having been played here.\n",
        "6... exd5 7. exd5 Nf6 8. Be2 Be7 9. O-O O-O 10. Be3": "Continuing development though Bf4 may have been more accurate.\nEA.Houdini gives in order of preference: 10 Re1 10 Bf4 10 g4",
        "10... c5 11. Re1 a6": "Seeking Q-side counterplay.",
        "12. a4": "Looking to prevent blacks q-side expansion\nAE. Houdini prefers 12.Nh4 12.Nd2 12.Bf4.So perhaps my choice was unnecessary.",
        "12... b6": "Played to prevent a5 but I think12.... Nbd7 was better then if 13.a5 black plays b5 14.axb Qxb6 with counterplay.\nEA. Houdini gives 12.......b6 as +0.73 for white preferring 12.....Bxf3 +0.39 or 12.....Nbd7 +0.46",
        "13. Nd2": "Heading for c4 and also happy to exchange of WSB.\nAE. Houdinis first choice with an evaluation of +0.92. But an easy move to choose as in this old-benoni type of position Nd2 offering the bishop exchange and heading for c4 is thematic.",
        "13... Bg6 14. Nc4 Ne4": "14......Nbd7 developing is better even though the move played allows an eventual b5 after the double exchange of minor pieces.\nEA. Houdini gives this as +1.58 for white preferring  14.....Re8 +0.90  14.....Nbd7 +1.00",
        "15. Nxe4 Bxe4 16. Bf3": "AE. Houdini prefers 16. Bd3 and 16.Bf4 both at +1.60 compared to 16.Bf3 +1.34",
        "16... Bxf3 17. Qxf3 Ra7 18. Bf4 Rd7 19. Re4": "Looking towards attacking the k-side.\nEA. Houdini prefers 19.Qb3 +1.75 compared to +1.31 for 19.Re4 but by this stage I had tunnel vision towards a K-side attack.",
        "19... b5 20. axb5 axb5 21. Na3": "Retreating but still attacking.",
        "21... Qb6": "Rb7 may have been better.\nAE. Houdini gives this as an error +2.34 for white preferring 21.....Rb7 +1.29 and 21....b4 +1.35",
        "22. Rae1": "Bringing the final reserves into the attack. \nAE. Houdini gives this as a mistake +1.51 preferring 22.Qe2 +2.38",
        "22... Bf6 23. c3": "Trying to slow down blacks Q-side counter-play.\nEA.A mistake given +0.75 Houdini preferring 23.Re8 +1.65 and 23. Qb3 +1.50",
        "23... Na6 24. Bh6": "Proud of this shot even though the computer programs don't rate it.\nEA. Interesting is the gameknot engine changes the position rating from+0.79 down to +0.39 after 24.Bh6 and Houdini rates similar.\nFrom exhilaration to the taste of ashes. My masterpiece is flawed.18.Qg4 =0.78 is preferred by both engines.",
        "24... Nc7": "A blunder better was Qd8 \nEA. Gameknot engine gives this as a blunder and suggests the following line as +0.39: 24.....Qd8 25.Qg3 Kh8 26.Bf4 Nc7 27.Qd3 c4 28.Qd1 Qa8 29.Qg4 Rfd8 30.Bg5 Bxg5 31.Qxg5 Qxd5 32.Qxd5 Nxd5 33.Nxb5\nBut doesn't 33.Re8 lead to mate? Conclusion, don't trust the gameknot engine.In the above line Houdini gives29....Rdd8 +0.00 with equality.\n",
