        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6": "The 2 knights. Usually black either plays this or Be7.",
        "4. Nc3": "An unexplained move. I was sure not expecting this. If she wanted to play 4 knights, then she should have played Nc3 before Bc4.",
        "4... Bc5": "Yes most people will argue to go Nx34 right now, but i prefer going into a game where you have all the pieces so you can attack more.",
        "5. O-O O-O 6. h3": "A very bad move. D3 is so much better.",
        "6... d6 7. d3 h6": "I really don't like the pin on g5 so i block it.",
        "8. a3 a5": "To prevent b4.",
        "9. a4": "A very bad move again. It does nothing and is just a lost tempo.",
        "9... Nh7": "Getting ready for f5.",
        "10. Bd2 Kh8 11. Ne2 f5 12. c3 fxe4 13. dxe4 Bxh3": "A move that she missed. It earns me a pawn.",
        "14. Bxh6": "The worst move i ever seen. She probably didn't know what I was doing, so she went the same move.",
        "14... gxh6 15. gxh3 Rxf3": "So now I got a free piece.",
        "16. Ng3": "Another blunder. She doesn't see the pin by my bishop.",
