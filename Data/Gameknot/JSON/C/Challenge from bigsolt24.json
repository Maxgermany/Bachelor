        "1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Bc5 4. h3 d6 5. d3 c6 6. Bg5 Qb6 7. Bxf6 gxf6": "Instead of making your next move as you did, I would consider moving your queen to b2.  You throw away your bishop, which may have been unnecessary here.",
        "8. Qd2 Bxf2+ 9. Qxf2 Qxb2": "As you can now see, this move opens up a very nice fork, forcing me to make a decision as to which piece I'd rather keep.",

Qh4 Qb6+": "Good move here to force me to act upon check, however, you don't really move your queen at all until you're desperate in the end.  Make better use of your queen as she is your most versatile weapon.",

Obviously, this move forces you to move your queen and allows me to kill your knight - which was protecting you from checkmate.  From here on out there wasn't really much you could do to prevent yourself from losing.",
