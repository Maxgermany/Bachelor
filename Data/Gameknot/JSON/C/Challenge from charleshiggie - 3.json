        "1. e4": "This is another game I had with the lovely MissLoly.",
        "1... c5": "I played e5 in our previous game, so I do somethng different.",
        "2. Bc4": "A good move, developing a piece to a good square and striking at f7.",
        "2... e6": "So I blunt the power of that bishop.",
        "3. Nf3": "Another good move, developing a piece.",
        "3... a6": "So I \"threaten\" a queen side pawn expansion, but she can just ignore it, like she did.",
        "4. O-O": "She continues to develop.",
        "4... b5": "So I attack.",
        "5. Be2": "Bishop drops back.",
        "5... Bb7": "I hit the e pawn.",
        "6. Nc3": "This protects the pawn, but d3 was a much better way of protecting it, as I can just drive the knight away.",
        "6... b4": "So I attack the knight.",
        "7. Na4": "She moves it.",
        "7... Bxe4": "And i take, to go a clear pawn up.",
        "8. Nxc5": "This is another bad mistake, just giving up a knight.",
        "8... Bxc5": "So I just take.",
        "9. d3": "She now attacks the bishop.",
        "9... Bd5": "So I drop back.",
        "10. d4": "And now she attacks the other bishop.",
        "10... Ba7": "And that one drops back.",
        "11. c4": "She continues with her policy of attacking my bishops.",
        "11... bxc3 e.p.": "Luckily I can take that pawn en passant. ",
        "12. bxc3": "She takes back.",
        "12... Qc7": "I prevent her from continuing her plan with c3-c4. Now, because of this queen move, if she does play c3-c4 then I can just take that pawn with my bishop, and if the then plays Qc2 pinning my bishop I can protect it with d7-d5. I am also attacking c3.",
        "13. Ne5": "This is another mistake, c3 needed protecting.",
        "13... d6": "So I drive the knight back first.",
        "14. Nd3": "It retreats.",
        "14... Qxc3": "I take, attacking d4 and Ra1.",
        "15. Bd2": "This saves the rook, but not the pawn.",
        "15... Qxd4 16. Be3": "She attacks the queen.",
        "16... Qf6": "Queen retreats.",
        "17. Qc1": "Post Match Computer Analysis (PMGA) gives 17. Nb4 as better, but this move is interesting, with potential attacks along the c file.",
        "17... e5": "PGMA gives this as a mistake. I will explain why I played it. I want to play Qg6 to threaten mate on g2. But if I play it immediately, she can play Nf4, so e5 was to stop Nf4.",
        "18. Bg5": "She attacks my queen. I have to be very careful here! Qg6?? is met by Qc8 mate!",
        "18... Qf5": "The queen on this square covers c8.",
        "19. a4": "This move doesn't achieve much.",
        "19... Nc6": "I want to play Qe4, but if I play it, she still has Qc8 mate - so I block that mate first.",
        "20. g4": "A dreadful move, opening up he own king side position.",
        "20... Qe4": "Mate on g2 or h1 can't be prevented.",
        "21. Qa3": "As good as anything.",
        "21... Qg2#": "And it is all over. Many thanks for reading this dear reader. Please leave a comment or two and rate this annotation on the star system, many thanks!"
