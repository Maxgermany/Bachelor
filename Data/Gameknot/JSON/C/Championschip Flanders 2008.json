        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3": "A four-knights game, I hate this! It's not agressive enough...",
        "3... Nf6 4. Bc4": "An Italian way of it, Bb5 is also possible, but then you have a Spanish variation of the FKG.",
        "4... Bc5 5. d3 d6 6. Bg5": "The first really active move, it's a normal one, but Nd5 is threatening...",
        "6... Na5 7. Qd2": "People normally play Bb3, but this is not a bad one, he receives the semi-open d-file.",
        "7... Nxc4 8. dxc4 c6": "because Nd5 was still threatening...",
        "9. Bxf6": "An odd move, you don't give your best piece for a stupid night!",
        "9... Qxf6 10. O-O-O": "If he would play Qg5, I can exange and I have the pair of the bishops, and I win the f2-pawn.",
        "10... Be6": "A strong and active move.",
        "11. Qe2 Rd8": "Defending my weakest link, the d-pawn.",
        "12. Kb1": "I'll never understand this move. He didn't play to win.",
        "12... O-O 13. Na4": "Trying to exange the night for the bishop.",
        "13... Bb4 14. a3 Ba5 15. c5": "It seems to be a good move, but if look good, you see the weaknesses he gives to white. For example: my bishop on e6 has a huge power! He became a killing spree! He will also deliver me of my weakness on d6.",
        "15... Bc7 16. Rd2": "Want to double the rooks.",
        "16... Qe7 17. Rhd1 b5": "This is a good move, I obligate him to take on e6!",
        "18. cxd6 Bxd6": "Now my both bishops are killing sprees.",
        "19. Nc3 Rd7": "Want to go to the b-file with my rook.",
        "20. Qe3 h6": "Don't want to exange the bishop for that night, so h6 is in this case an acceptable move.",
        "21. Rd2d3": "Want to go with the queen to d2, but I win a tempo.",
        "21... Bc4 22. Rd3d2 Rb8": "Yes! He's on the b-file!",
        "23. g4 b4": "Strong move.",
        "24. axb4 Rxb4 25. g5": "Who will be the first to have a really strong attack?",
        "25... Rxb2+": "It will be me, this is a powerfull move who kills my poor opponent...",
        "26. Ka1": "after 26. Kxb2 Ba3  27. Ka1 Bb2 !! 28. Kxb2 Qb4  he also doesn't have any chance...",
        "26... Bb8": "An important move, all the rest loses! (because there will be Rxd6!)",
        "27. Nd5 Ra2+ 28. Kb1 Rb7+ 29. Qb3 Qa3": "And now he gave up! I hope you have enjoyed this game!"
