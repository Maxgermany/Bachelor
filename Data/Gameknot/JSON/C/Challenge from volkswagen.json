        "4. Qd3 Nf6 5. Bg5 e5": "Pins the knight, but better than having doubled pawns on the king side",
        "6. a3 Bc5 7. Nf3 d6 8. b4": "Hmm, white is pushing pawns while not fully developed. ",
        "8... Bb6 9. b5 Nd4": "I was hoping for 10. Nxd4 Bxd4 11. Ra2 Be6 and the rook is trapped",
        "10. Nc3 Bg4 11. Be2 Rc8": "Building up on the c3 knight",
        "12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. Nd5 Qd8 14. c3": "playing Rb1 would have been better before this move, in my opinion, as it limits my knight's squares to run to. In any case, I was eyeing the c5 square as a nice outpost for the knight",

        "28... Na3": "Forking the bishop and rook. White's position is falling apart.",
