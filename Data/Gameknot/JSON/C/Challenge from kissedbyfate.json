        "1. d4": "Queen's pawn game. I prefer this move myself when playing white",
        "1... d5 2. c3": "A strange and slightly passive move by white here. Transposes the game into the queens pawn variation of the Saragossa Opening, a rather uncommon opening.",
        "2... c5": "Black attacks whites central d pawn. ",
        "3. Nf3": "Defending the d pawn and developing. Good move.",
        "3... Nc6": "Black develops his knight as well eqalizing the fight for the center",
        "4. Qa4": "White violates on of the basic opening principles by moving her queen out early. There is no strategic or tactical benefit for this opening violation",
        "4... Bd7": "Black takes advantage of whites dubious queen advance and sets up a discovered attack on the white queen. White should now retreat the queen with a move like Qc2",
        "5. e4": "e4 allows black to take advantage of the discovery on the queen...",
        "5... Nxd4": "Whites response here should be Qd1",
        "6. Bb5": "Bb5?? Hangs the bishop by moving it right into the line of fire from both black's knight and Bishop.",
        "6... Nxb5": "Here, again, a possible discovered attack on the white queen. White needs to retreat her. Qc2 here is a good move",
        "7. g4": "Dont have a clue what this move was really for...ignores the discovered attack that looms...",
        "7... Nxc3": "Black's knight gets another \"free\" move and takes another pawn. The queen now under a double attack has to find a safe place to run. Qc2, once again will accomplish this.",
        "8. Qa5": "Ouch...hangs the white queen...",
        "8... Qxa5": "white loses the queen. Black now has a discoverd check, and a threat on the previously advanced pawn on g4",

        "12... Nxe4": "Leaves the bishop but black is a queen and 4 pawns ahead and can afford to give back a bit of material for positional play. Black now triple attacks the pinned knight on c3",
        "13. O-O": "White finaly unpins the knight, but is a little late...",
        "13... Nxc3 14. Nxg4 Ne2+": "Black needs to save his knight...",
        "15. Kg2 Qb6": "Really, Im just trying to get my queen to the other side of the d and c pawns, but Im doing so with threats along the way. Qb6 fits into that plan and threatens the pawn on b2 as well as a check on c6",

        "16... Qc6+": "Black continues his plan, with check this time...",

        "23. h5": "White is out of ideas? Nf2 can bring some help over to defend against the passer. Re4 would open the bishops defence of the d2 square...",
        "23... d2": "Black takes advantage of his passed pawn. whites limited responses include Rb1 and Nf2 to attempt a stop...",
        "24. Re4": "gives black another queen...thanks!",
