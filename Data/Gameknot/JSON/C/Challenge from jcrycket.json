Maybe.  The Rook would protect vulnerable d4, and White would have few options, the most aggressive being Rxe4 which would leave my Queen parked in a good spot...\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, I cannot ignore the e4 Pawn.  exf5 exposes my Rook to his. \r\n\r\n",

Rxe4 26. a4": "I could play a5 and stop the advance, leaving a4 vulnerable to Qa3...\r\nBut without my Queen to support, a Rook exchange would leave my opponent up 1, instead of down 1! \r\n\r\nPerhaps I should initiate a Rook exchange.  We could trade Queens too, and start the pawn race... \r\n\r\nQc3 looks promising - She attacks the Rook, Queen and Pawn in one fell swoop.   \r\n\r\nBut I think I like d3 best.  Pressing matters...",
