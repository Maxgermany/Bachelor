        "1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5": "the french defence. I play french, petrov, caro, Alekhine, 2 knights chigorin gambit (against the Ng5 attack) regularly.",
        "3. e5": "the advance variation. This move is now played a lot more at the master level these days, but the main idea of the french for white is Nd2 or Nc3, which I respond with rubenstein's dxe4, if a draw is what I want.",
        "3... c5": "this move is almost always played.",
        "4. b3": "what the?! I have never seen this. If I didn't know my opponent, I would think that he is either very strong or a beginner. Turns out he's neither, but...",
        "4... cxd4 5. Qxd4 Nc6 6. Bb5": "here, I begin to realize I may have tactical chances if white plays incorrectly.",
        "6... Qa5+ 7. Nc3 Bb4": "My first thought is that this forces white to play Bishop takes knight ch, which I respond b takes c6, and I white will have to call off the fianchetto because of ideas like c5 and d4 bombing the knight on c3.",
        "8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. Nge2": "blunder on the 9th move, It seems like I win with Ba6 or c5. After making sure he does not have counters involving the h8 rook, I play the c5 d4",
        "9... c5 10. Qd3 d4": "winning a piece",
        "11. Bb2 Ba6 12. Qe4 Rc8": "I figure I have enough material to win after I get the knight, retreat, safeguard my position, and then attack his position with my extra material.",
        "13. O-O Bxc3 14. Bxc3 dxc3": "the rest of the game is easy, so enjoy.",
        "15. Rfe1 Ne7 16. Nf4 O-O 17. a4 Qb4 18. Qf3 Rcd8 19. Re3 Bb7 20. Qg3 Nf5": "white resigns"
