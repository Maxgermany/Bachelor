        "9. O-O": "White castles and offers the d (gambit) pawn.",
        "9... Nxd4": "I decide to take the pawn. Surely white's attack can't be that strong?",
        "10. Nxd4 Qxd4 11. Nf3": "White attacks black's Q and defends the e-pawn.",
        "11... Qb6": "Black retreats, so has lost 2 moves of development for the pawn.",
        "12. Qa4 Bc5": "Bc5 prevents Be3 and Re1",
        "13. a3": "Still in the World DB. Threatening to drive the bishop away with b4.",
        "13... a6": "Black plays a6 creating a retreat square for his queen and preventing Bb5. This is the first move not in the World DB. Omens are not good though... in the Gameknot DB 13...a6 has 100% (3x) win for white.",
        "14. Bd2 Qa7": "White gets further ahead with development",
        "15. Qg4": "...and shifts his attach to the king side",
        "15... g6": "Black prevents Qxg7, but black squares become weaker. (The alternative of castling or Kf8 look like suicide!)",
        "16. b4": "White grabs more space and drives away black's bishop. ",
        "16... Bf8": "I would probably have played this anyway to defend g7 and h6.",
        "17. Be3": "White can finally play Be3 and black's queen is hit again. That pawn is getting more and more expensive! ",
        "17... Qb8": "Black retreats but hits the pawn on e5.",
        "18. Qg5": "White decides to defend e5, but this doesn't look like the best square for his queen.",

        "19. Bd4": "White defends d4 again.",
        "19... b6": "Creating space for the B on c8, but what if white takes the open c file with his rooks?",
        "20. Rfe1": "Fortunately white now seems obsessed with defending e5.",
        "20... Bb7 21. Qe3": "White puts pressure now on b6 so I defend with Qd8",

        "29... Kh7 30. Qe2 Kh8": "Phew! I have reached the time control with seconds to spare. White has 10 minutes. Now we both get +15 minutes to finish the game.",
        "31. g4": "White goes for the kill! Black's bishop is doomed and the king would quickly follow. e.g. 32 gxh5, gxh5 33 Qxh5...34QxB...  35 Qg7 mate\nSo what should black do now???",
        "31... Rc4": "Time for desperate measures! At least I've got white thinking...",
        "32. Bxc4 dxc4": "The diversion has worked! White wins the exchange, but loses his strong bishop and black has a passed pawn on c4 and my bishop on b7 is active at last.",
        "33. g5": "White continues to trap my black bishop, but now my king looks safer. Surely gxh5 would still win.  \nNow what should black play??",
        "33... Nxf6": "33...Nxf6! hits the Bishop on d4 and gives me hope with 3 pawns for the piece.",
        "34. exf6 Qxd4+": "Now white must be careful, for it's my turn to have mating chances.",
        "35. Rf2": "The best move. Both 35.Nf2 and Qf2 lose quickly.\n",
        "35... Qc3": "Hitting the N on h3. \n35...Qd5 threatening 36...Qh1 mate fails to 36 Rg2 or Kf1",
        "36. Nf4 Bxg5": "And the black bishop is free!!!",
        "37. Nxh5": "White can grab this pawn with impunity, since gxNh5 loses quickly, but he has overlooked my next move.",
        "37... Qc1+": "I hope for 38. Rf8, when ...Be3+ wins the queen.",
        "38. Qf1 Qxf1+": "So I exchange queens",

        "39... gxh5": "And win the N.",
        "40. h4": "Now we are both short of time. White tries for a direct attack on my king up the h file.",
