        "3. Nf3": "standard move attack king pawn",
        "3... Nc6": "defend king pawn",
        "4. Bc4": "i can only assume this to be a standard move attacking f7 pawn preparing the way for knight to take h8 rook and in turn takes a hold on centre of the board",
        "4... Nf6": "ultimately to allow a fight for d5 ",
        "5. O-O d6 6. a3": "stop knight advance ???",
        "6... a6": "ok then 2 can play at that game !! but seriously this'll allow me to force his bishop out of the way",
        "7. d3": "to allow bishop room to manoeuvre? ",
        "7... Rb8": "mmmm all this to protect b7 pawn when i advance it. Don't know whether it's worth it but want to start pushing up the board now.",
        "8. Bg5": "aah yes bishop out.. Will he really do knight for bishop ?? probably not i think just prevent me moving knight for a bit.. why ??",
        "8... Be7": "don't like it so give added protection for queen ",
        "9. Bxf6": "oh didn't think he'd do that really can't see what this achieves. can't move knight to g5 as he must know i'll take bishop with my bishop which protects g5 ?? am i missing something here ??",
        "9... Bxf6": "got to do this need pawn for defense only move that makes sense... feel a little bit vulnerable here he's chosing my moves for me",
        "10. Bd5": "stop b7 pawn advance ??",
        "10... Qb6": "thought about move to c7 here but just thought i'd test the water and see what happens if i attack pawn.....he must move rook or perhaps pawn but maybe he'll move his queen allowing me to attack his f3 knight with bishop !! yeah right !",
        "11. Rb1": "as predicted foolish of me really...though you never know.  wasted move though.",
        "11... Qc7": "back to original plan queen c7 gonna advance pawn",
        "12. h3": "well that stops a move to g4 with bishop",
        "12... Bxh3": "gave this move a lot of thought as it puts me at quite a bit of a piece disadvantage but this will open his king up",
        "13. gxh3": "ok",
        "13... Ne7": "trying to get a bit of a defense here at the same time as putting some pieces across this side of the board for an attack.. he's not got a lot of options ere he needs to get his king safe which i hope will give me a couple of free moves",
        "14. Re1": "preparing the way for king ?",

        "16. Re3": "that was a good move that's put me under pressure to save my queen and h8 rook",
        "16... Nxd5": "eliminating danger of rook attack by removing bishop i expect him to take this then i'll take pawn on h4",
        "17. Nxd5 Bxh4 18. Nxe5 Qc8 19. Qg4 Qxg4+ 20. Nxg4 O-O 21. Rh3 g5 22. Nh6+": "oooh thankfully he's missed the fork opportunity i saw that too late. could have been game over",

        "35. Ra4 d5": "resigning the fact that pawns are now of no use to me i move it out of the way to allow rook through",
        "36. Rf7+": "missed this move i was expecting him to take a pawn...annoying",

        "38. Nxd5 Kh3": "probably gone wrong with rook move previously as king now moves into it's path but moving king up to try and reach h1 or at least h2 to allow rook to come up.  feel at the moment this is all in vain and a little late but can't see another option",
        "39. Ne3 Kh2 40. Ke2 Rg1 41. c5 Rb1 42. Ng4+": "game over",
