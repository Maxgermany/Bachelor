        "1. d4 d6 2. e4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Nf3 Bg4 5. Be3 e5 6. d5": "6. exf5 would be too drawish.",
        "6... Nb4 7. a3 Bxf3": "The right move, doubling White's pawns. White might have played 7. Be2.",
        "8. gxf3 a5": "This simply loses. The only good move was 8...Na6.",
        "9. axb4 axb4 10. Rxa8 Qxa8 11. Nb5 Qa5 12. c3 bxc3 13. Nxc3 c6 14. dxc6 bxc6 15. Bc4 Qb4": "Black should finish his development with 15...Be7 and 16...0-0.",
        "16. Qb3": "Protects Bishop and b2 pawn, as well as threatening the Black Queen and the f7 pawn.",
        "16... d5": "Probably safer was to exchange Queens. Now he loses more material.",
        "17. exd5 cxd5 18. Bxd5 Nxd5 19. Qxd5 Qxb2 20. Qxe5+ Be7 21. Qb5+": "When ahead in material, exchange pieces.",
        "21... Qxb5 22. Nxb5 O-O 23. O-O h5 24. Nd4 g5 25. Nf5 Bf6 26. h4": "This was a daring move, but I calculated I could regain the pawn by attacking the Rook and King.",
        "26... gxh4 27. Bh6 Rd8 28. f4 Kh7": "The best move, I think, forcing White to exchange his powerful Bishop for Black's less threatening one.",
        "29. Bg5 Bxg5 30. fxg5 h3 31. f4 Rd2 32. Rf2 Rd5 33. Nh4 Rd3": "There was probably no way to save the advanced black pawn.",
        "34. Rf3": "Now, of course, if he exchanges Rooks, Black will lose the pawn to 35. Kh2, Kg6, 36. Nh5+, etc.",
        "34... Rd6 35. Rxh3 f6": "Black hopes to exchange all the pawns so that none can be promoted. This does not work.",
        "36. g6+": "Now, even after the correct retreat, 36...Kg8, 37. Nf5, Rd1+, 38. Kf2, Rd2+, 39. Ke3, Black must give up the other h-pawn. If 39...Rd5?, 40. Ne7+ forks the Rook and King.",
        "36... Kh6": "Of course, this wins much more quickly.",
