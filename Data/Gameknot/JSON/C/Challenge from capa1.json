        "13. c3 bxc3 14. Rxc3 Qb6 15. Rc1 a5 16. a4 b4": "Black has got a winner in the b4 pawn if the pieces come off.",
        "17. Qe2 Bg6 18. h3 Nf5": "The c file already looks tempting but black is not tempted.  It reminds me of a game i saw at Scarborough a couple of years ago. The open file was available and a rook could easily occupy the open file.  This player would not do it.  5 to 10 moves later he had to resign.",
        "19. g4 Nfxd4 20. Nxd4 Nxd4 21. Qe3 Bc5 22. Rxc5": "This took a long think and even when I played it I was not sure.  The rooks may be more important because of  the open c file.",
        "22... Qxc5 23. Rc1 Ne2+": "This is worth playing. It disrupts whites plans of bd4 etc.",
        "24. Qxe2 Qe7 25. Nf3 Be4": "Not a bad move but why not Ra or f to c8 first?  ",
        "26. Nd4 Qh4": " Not a bad move but why not occupy the open file first? This could be played afterwards.",
        "27. f3 Bg6 28. Kg2 f5": "The principle was correct but this is tactically flawed.  A  rook occupying the open c file has been a good idea for some moves.",
        "29. Nxe6 Rf7 30. Bxd5": "Black resigned. Black had a very good position but would not occupy the open file.  In some JR Capablanca games all he seems to do is occupy the open file.  The force of that open file is often enough to win."
