        "4. Nf3": "White doesn't take the bite. Here, a lot of little tactics can be performed by white starting with Bb5+, and after black blocks the check, dxe6 forces black to open the f column. ",

        "8. Bd2": "White unpins his knight, preventing my Ne4. ",
        "8... c5": "I made a clumpsy attempt to move the game on. I knew I left a hole in b5, but after Qb5+, I would have to choose among Qd7, and the more intriguing Nf-d7, since after Qxb7, Ndb6 blocks the white queen very badly. ",

        "11. Qxa5": "My reasoning must have been right. White didn't want to play my game, and went for simplification. I don't know if he wants to exploit Nb5, but this allows BxB+, and either ways white takes it,  black can shield and even treat something on the e column, one castled. ",

Otherwise, I must do it with my lsb, because my knight is dued to the defence of d5. This makes me lose a lot of tempoes. Without rooks on the board, my king is better placed near to the action, and, moreover...\n3) It allows my lsb to move to f5, from where it threats heavily c2, not easy to defend. \nI assume white would try to attack with the g pawn (g4, g5), but I am confident I'll be able to handle that with my own threats.
