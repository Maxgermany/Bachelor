    "moves": {
        "1. d4 Nf6": "First chance for me to play Trompowsky against a strong player",
        "2. Bg5 e6": "Expecting h4 but with this move he appears to be protecting his pawn structure and developing at the same time",
        "3. Nf3": "Book move",
        "3... h6": "After his last move I was expecting d5 or Nc6",
        "4. Bf4": "Book says take the knight, I retreated",
        "4... c5": "His first attack, trying to get some control on the centre",
        "5. c3 Nc6 6. e3": "I felt like I had a solid pawn structure in the centre with some good defense",
        "6... Nh5": "I felt the bishop retreat to g3 pointless as he could still take the bishop and force me to take with a pawn, maybe best play was Be5",
        "7. Bd3": "Played a developing move instead and this was against the principle of never trade bishop for knight early in the game, now could be forced with Nxf4 to defend\n\nThis was my weakest move so far and should of played Be5 or Bg3 because I retain the centre pawn and structure that way",
        "7... cxd4": "Feeling attacked now and need to defend\nKing safety was considered here but chose to use the c-pawn to keep another pawn in the centre and protected by knight on f3",
        "8. cxd4": "I considered Nxd4 here, would have attacked the knight on h5 gaining a tempo",
        "8... Nxf4": "Inevitable, should I have traded it earlier during attack on f6? ",
        "9. exf4": "Pieces in the centre although both pawns unguarded and need king safety",
        "9... Qb6": "dynamic_dv attacks both the b2 and d4 pawns, punishment for unprotected pieces",
        "10. Qd2": "Clearly I am trying to defend the b2 pawn, however I have hung the d4 pawn with 10...Nxd4 11. Nxd4 Qxd4 and now down a central pawn\n\nBetter options were Nc3 to continue development, or castling for king safety and activating the rook",
        "10... Nxd4 11. Nxd4 Qxd4 12. Nc3": "At this point feeling pressured although game is fairly even still",
        "12... a6": "I found this move very frustrating as I wanted the play Nb5, almost like he is forcing play to the centre, or that is what it felt like",
        "13. Ne2": "Tried the attack the Queen, better options could have been castling or activating the a1 rook, there was an empty c-file or more support for the d-file",
        "13... Qb4": "Now I see my error, he forces a Queen trade which will force me to take with my King and take away my castling ability #blunder?\n\nJust as I was about to trade I saw the Nc3 which was definitely a better option, although getting no chance to attack at all",
        "14. Nc3": "A moment to breathe..",
        "14... d5": "Attacks the centre and threatens d4 next move",
        "15. a3": "Only logical reply I could see...",
        "15... Qd6": "I get some space but he attacks another undefended pawn on f4",
        "16. O-O": "A belated king safety",
        "16... g6 17. g3": "Not sure why I played this, I felt a lot of pressure on the f4 pawn and felt this gave it some protection.\nBetter options were Ra-c1 or Rf-e1",
        "17... Bg7 18. Ne4": "I saw a plan here, playing Ne4, dxe4, Bb5+ and Qxd6.. something must be wrong, it's not that easy...\nMistake here was not to analyse the board thoroughly before playing Ne4 - this cost me the game",
        "18... dxe4 19. Bb5+ Ke7": "The move I missed which defends the queen",
        "20. Qxd6+ Kxd6 21. Rfd1+ Ke7 22. Be2 Bd7 23. Rd2 Rhd8 24. Rb1 Ba4 25. Rxd8 Rxd8 26. b3 Bc6": ""
