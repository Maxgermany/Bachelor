        "6... Qa5+": "This check, which also hits the bishop on g4. Now she can't put the queen in the way, as I simply exchange queens and take the knight on d4, so the only way to save the pieces is....",
        "7. Bd2": "This move, which unprotects the Nd4, but I can't take it immediately as my queen is attacked, so....",
        "7... Qc5": "Now I am threatening both the knight on d4 and the bishop on c4. Now the only way for Black to save the piece is Nxc6, and although black's position is not very good, at least material balance is maintained, for instance, 8.\tNxc6\tQxc4 9. Na5 Qxe4+ 10.\tKf1 b6 11. Nb3\tBb7 12. f3 Qf5 was sasusa (1643) vs. chesshub (2339) which black won in 24.",

        "22... Rhd8": "I get ready to by d7-d5 following by opening the d file for my rooks.",
        "23. Kg1": "Strange move. With queens on the board, this would be a good safety move, but in this position the kings are safe enough in the centre. Ke2 would have been better, stopping my rook invasion which follows.",
        "23... d5": "So I open the d file, also possibly increasing the scope of my Ba6",
