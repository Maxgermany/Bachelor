    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "This was a Gameknot game I played with one of my Oswestry Chess Club colleagues.",
        "1... d5": "It starts conventionally enough.",
        "2. c4": "Queen's Gambit.",
        "2... e6": "Declined.",
        "3. Nc3": "I play the main line.",
        "3... Nf6": "So does he.",
        "4. Bg5": "I pin the knight.",
        "4... Be7": "He unpins.",
        "5. e3": "I open up the diagonal for my f1 bishop.",
        "5... h6": "By playing this now, he reduces my options, for instance, if he plays 5....0-0 immediately, I have 6. Qc2 and can meet 6....h6 with 7. h4?! with interesting complications (which don't necessarily favour white).",
        "6. Bh4": "So I drop the bishop back.",
        "6... Nc6": "I have two opening databases on my Gameknot system. One is the world database of over-the-board games played by the top players and the other is the database of openings played by the best Gameknot players. This move 6....Nc6 is not even in the world database - and for good reasons. In this variation, black usually plays at some time either c7-c6 strengthening the centre, or c7-c5 contesting the centre. This rules out both these options for the time being.",
        "7. Nf3": "I played this to stop any idea he may have of e6-e5.",
        "7... O-O": "He castles.",
        "8. Rc1": "I develop.",
        "8... Nh7": "This is another mistake. My Bh4 is my bad bishop, being on the same colour as my pawns in the centre on d4 and e3. His Be7 is his good bishop, being on the opposite colour to his pawns on e6 and d5. Yet he invites me to exchange my good bishop for his bad bishop.",
        "9. Bxe7": "Which I glad accept.",
        "9... Nxe7": "He takes back.",
        "10. e4": "I advance in the centre. Gameknot computer gives this as a mistake, but in the only game in the database with this variation, white won. It seems logical to advance in the centre while I can.",
        "10... dxc4": "This is another slight inaccuracy, allowing my Bf1 to develop with tempo.",
        "11. Bxc4": "So I take back.",
        "11... Nc6": "Knight returns to its post.",
        "12. O-O": "I castle.",
        "12... Ng5": "He improves the position of his Nh7.",
        "13. Nxg5": "I take.",
        "13... Qxg5": "He takes back.",
        "14. f4": "I hit his queen and gain more space.",
        "14... Qe7": "Queen retreats.",
        "15. Rf3": "With ideas of either moving across to help a king side attack, or go over to d3 to help with a d4-d5 push.",
        "15... Bd7": "He develops this bishop at last.",
        "16. a3": "I stop his knight or queen from going to b4.",
        "16... Rad8": "His a rook comes over.",
        "17. Rd3": "And my rooks supports the d pawn.",
        "17... Bc8": "and the bishop drops back to discover an attack on the d pawn.",
        "18. b4": "I gain space on the queen side.",
        "18... a6": "He prevents the further advance of the b pawn.",
        "19. g3": "I support my f pawn.",
        "19... b5": "Gaining space on the queen side, but leaving his c pawn backward.",
        "20. Bb3": "My bishop drops back.",
        "20... Bb7": "and his bishop improves his prospects.",
        "21. Rc2": "With the idea of coming across to the d file also to support the d pawn advance.",
        "21... Rd7": "He also seems to be planning to bring his other rook to d8.",
        "22. d5": "I decide to strike.",
        "22... exd5": "He takes.",
        "23. Nxd5": "I take back, attacking his queen.",
        "23... Qd8": "Queen drops back.",
        "24. Nf6+": "This discovered attack wins the exchange.",
        "24... Qxf6": "He takes the knight.",
        "25. Rxd7": "I take the rook. I had looked at this position before, which is a reason why I played g2-g3 so that in this position so that he couldn't now take my pawn on f4.",
        "25... Rd8": "He tries to contest the d file.",
        "26. Rxd8+": "So I take.",
        "26... Nxd8": "he takes back.",
        "27. Rxc7": "Gameknot criticises this move too, preferring 27. e5 Qb6+ 28. Rc5 Ne6 29. Qd7 Bc6 30. Qe7 Be4 31. f5 Ng5 32. h4 Nf3+ 33. Kf2 Qb8 34. Qxf7+ Kh8 35. f6 gxf6 36. exf6 Qa7 37. Qg8# but this looks good. If he checks on b6 I can drop my rook back to c5 and if Ne6 I can take his knight with my bishop. ",
        "27... Bxe4": "Computer prefers Qb6+ 28. Rc5 Bxe4 29. Qd4 Bg6 30. g4 Kf8 31. f5 Bh7 32. Qd7 Bg8 33. a4 bxa4 34. Bxa4 g6 35. Kf1 Kg7 36. fxg6 Qxb4",
        "28. Rc8": "This is a winning pin now.",
        "28... Qb6+": "The checks start at last.",
        "29. Kf1": "Forced!",
        "29... Bg2+": "I hadn't considered this! Now if I take he has Qb7+ winning the rook on c8.",
        "30. Ke1": "So the king moves instead.",
        "30... Qe3+": "Another check.",
        "31. Qe2": "Again, the only way out of the check.",
        "31... Qg1+": "Another check. Some fancy footwork is now required to escape the checks.",
        "32. Kd2": "Forced again.",
        "32... Qd4+": "Another check.",
        "33. Qd3": "Now my queen has an x-ray attack on the knight.",
        "33... Qf2+": "It is near the end.",
        "34. Kc3": "My king is getting away.",
        "34... Qe1+": "Another check.",
        "35. Kb2": "My king is safer now, surrounded by my own pieces.",
        "35... Qf2+": "One final check.",
        "36. Bc2": "And now the threat is taking the knight with mate, now that h7 is covered. \nBlack now resigned.\nMany thanks for reading this, please rate this annotation on the star system, and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!"
