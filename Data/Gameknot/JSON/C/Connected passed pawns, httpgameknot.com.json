        "1. d4": "I play white in this blitz game.  Normal queen's gambit opening for a while.",
        "1... d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. a3": "I don't know why I chose this move order.  There's probably something wrong with this move.  However, the queen's gambit seems to be a bit forgiving to a beginner like me.",
        "3... e6 4. Nc3 c6 5. Bg5": "Where does this bishop go, here or f4?  I tried this one.",
        "5... Be7 6. e3 O-O 7. Nf3 a6": "Not sure what this does.  b5 is already unavailable to the N.  I suppose it prepares b5 pawn push.",
        "8. Ne5": "This move goes in the \"try\" category.",
        "8... b5": "There's the push.",
        "9. b3": "Required.",
        "9... Bb7 10. Be2 Nbd7": "Kicks my N.",
        "11. Nxd7 Qxd7 12. O-O h6 13. Bh4 Nh7 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. cxb5": "My normal conundrum--how to handle pawns???  Help?",
        "15... axb5 16. b4": "?? the a pawn is backward, my B is still junk.  (So is black's, though...)",
        "16... e5 17. Re1 f5": "Black charges ahead.  I search for counterplay.",
        "18. dxe5 Qxe5": "Threatens the N, which has very few squares, threatens some sort of infiltration.",
        "19. Qc1": "Several options to protect the N, I went with the one that doubled up on a3.  I probably should have kept the Q aimed at a4, however.  Ahh, blitz.",
        "19... Ng5 20. a4": "Looking for counterplay on the Queen side.  This threatens to win a pawn, actually, and I'm not sure black's best response.  Perhaps bxa4, followed by a rook trade, is best.  This does allow white a good knight on c5, however.  But black opted for...",
        "20... Ne4": "Easily dealt with, allowing me to trade a weak knight for a strong one.",
        "21. Nxe4 fxe4 22. axb5": "The pawn is won, if I'm not mistaken.",
        "22... Rxa1 23. Qxa1 Qf5": "Black tries to keep up the attack, but plays a dangerous game with the a and b files.",
        "24. Rf1 Ra8 25. Qb2": "c1 was an interesting try, doubling the attack on c6; but I wanted to avoid a rook inflitration.",
        "25... h5": "Black tries to keep the attack going, but his plan is too slow.",
        "26. Rc1": "Threatening bxc6 with a winning advantage.",
        "26... h4": "?  Black lacks an immediate threat, and is allowing connected passed pawns.",
        "27. bxc6": "! obvious, and deadly.  Black lacks an adequate reply.",
        "27... Bc8 28. b5": "Passed pawns must be pushed!",
        "28... g5": "Too slow.",
        "29. b6": "Threatening b7 and the fork.",
        "29... Rb8 30. b7": "Push!",
        "30... Be6 31. c7": "And push!",
        "31... Rxb7": "Off comes the rook.",
        "32. Qxb7 h3 33. g3 Bc8": "A try, but walks into a pin.",
        "34. Qb8 Kg7": "Breaks the pin",
        "35. Ba6": "Perhaps maneuvering the rook to the 8th rank was a better plan, but Black is lost.",
        "35... Bxa6 36. c8=Q Qf3": "Black goes all in, hoping for a slip.  I had about 1:00 left on the clock, but apparently that wasn't enough for me to find a forced mate with two queens and a rook on the stranded king.  Oh well.  Back to the tactical training for me.",
        "37. Qcg8+": "?  Qh8, denying the retreat down the h file, was needed, followed by a Qb8 to c7 or d6.",
