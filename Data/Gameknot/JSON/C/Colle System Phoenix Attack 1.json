        "1. d4": "The Queen pawn opening is the best move for those who want to improve quickly, avoid huge amounts of theory, learn the elements of attacking play and at the same time restrict their opponents options from the start of the game...it provides a method for learning chess at a more leisurely rate and avoid being overrun with tactics from more knowledgeable opponents.\n",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nf3": "A slower method of play for white but avoids Black's favorite repertoir against Queen's Gambit and places White on hopefully more familiar ground.",
        "2... d5 3. e3": "The Colle System which is often times underestimated by Black",
        "3... e6": "Black had the option of ..Bf5 but White would secure Queenside space with c4 and Qb3",
        "4. Bd3 c5 5. c3": "allowing Bc2 to keep the bishop on the attacking diagonal",
        "5... Nc6 6. Nbd2 Be7": "a solid option for Black but one which white can use to transpose to his favorite variation regardless of whether the bishop is on e7 or d6",
        "7. O-O O-O 8. dxc5": "Starting the Phoenix attack which is the subject of a book by Rudel",
        "8... Bxc5 9. b4": "charge!",
        "9... Bd6 10. Bb2 Ne5 11. Nxe5 Bxe5 12. Rc1": "The bishops are poised for attack once c4 is played",
        "12... a6 13. Nf3 Qd6 14. Nxe5 Qxe5": "Black loses time moving the queen multiple times and neglecting development",
        "15. Qe2": "Now c4 becomes a positional and tactical threat",
        "15... Qd6 16. c4 dxc4 17. Rxc4 Nd5": " A blunder by Black allowing a quick finish",
        "18. Bxh7+ Kh8 19. Qh5 Nf6 20. Bxf6": "Black resigned...the Colle allows one to learn how to attack with little risk."
