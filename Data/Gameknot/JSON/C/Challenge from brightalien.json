        "1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3": "4. e3  We are both headed out of all the main lines of the King's Indian now.  Nothing of the Classical, Four Pawns', Petrosian, Fianchetto, Saemisch, or Panno variations.  This is a temporarily very closed variation called the East Indian.  Good name, as it has a slightly mysterious, almost mystical (call it a kind of quantum energy) field!  You won't see any of the conventional center pawn play here.  That means there can arise a very sudden flank attack at any moment for either side.  In this case, Black starts it first.",
        "4... Bg7 5. Bd3 O-O 6. O-O Nc6 7. a3 Re8 8. Na4": "8. Na4.  In this position, I have seen no alternatives except for 8. b4 and 8. Ng5.  Na4 has the potential to kick up a lot of harassment by White on the Queen side.  But I was already beginning to think about a flank attack on the other side.",
        "8... e5 9. Bb5 Bg4": "9...Bg4.  The two flank attacks are already forming, one on the Queen side for White, and one on the King side for Black.",
        "10. dxe5": "10. dxe5.  I had hoped for this move, so I could initiate some serious pressure on White's King's Knight, starting with a diversion of my Rook sacrifice.  It is true that I saw no immediate positional or material compensation for the Rook, but more of that later.\r\n\r\nProbably his best choice here is 10. Nc5.  I would then have to decide if I should deflect my Queen with 10...Qc8.  Then 11. dxe5 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Nxe5 13. Qf4 c6 14. Be2 would happen, and the King side action has vanished before it even started.  ",
        "10... Nxe5": "10...Nxe5.  Of course!  Now the pressure heats up on the King side.  I briefly considered 10...Ne4  11. Bxc6 bxc6  12. Qd3  Qd7 13. c4 Bxf3 14. gxf3 Ng5 15. e4 Rxe5 and thought there might be a slight advantage to Black.  But nothing as forcing as what happens after 10...Nxe5.",
        "11. Bxe8 Nxe8": "11....Nxe8.  I did not want to deflect the King's Knight backward like this, as it should be a big part of the King side action.  So I came close to playing 11...Qxe8, but chose to keep the Queen in all the action first. ",
        "12. h3": "12. h3.  A fairly serious oversight, I think.  This merely precipitates what was coming in any case.  So he probably needed to consider 12. Nc5 Nxf3+ 13. gxf3  Bh3 14. f4 Bxf1  15. Qxf1 b6 16. Nd3 Nd6  17. Qh3 Nc4 with a slight edge to Black.  ",
        "12... Nxf3+ 13. gxf3 Bxh3 14. f4": "14. f4  An absolutely critical choice to stop 14....Qg5+ and mate in two moves.",
        "14... Qh4": "14....Qh4.  The immediate threat now is 15...Bg4 16. f3 Qg3+, etc.   I think my choice to recapture the Bishop with my Knight (with 11...Nxe8) was the best choice now, as my Queen could not post here on h4 if I had recaptured with the Queen.  A lot of threats are now available to Black to force mate, depending upon where the Bishop and Queen end up.  \r\n\r\nI did not bother with 14...Bxf1, as the Queen and Bishop are needed to do the job.  ",
        "15. Re1 Nf6 16. Nc5": "16. Nc5.  Probably a blunder, but I see no good alternatives here.  I thought he might try 16. Qf3 to protect the f2 Pawn after my 16...Ne4, and I then planned 16...Ne4 and either: (i) 17. Nc3 Bg4 18. Qg2 Nxc3 19. bxc3 Bxc3 skewering one of the two Rooks, and hopefully the King's Rook so that ....Bxe1 puts more pressure on the f2 Pawn, or (ii) 17. Rb1 Re8 18. Nc3 Nxc3 19. bxc3 Bxc3 20. Rf1 b6 21. Rd1 Bg4 22. Qxd5 Bxd1 23. Qxd1 with a strong edge in space. ",
        "16... Bg4 17. f3 Qg3+ 18. Kf1 Bxf3": "18...Bxf3. It's all over but the shouting. ",
        "19. Qd2": "19. Qd2.   White will have a longer life after 19. Re2 Ng4  20. Qd2 Qh3+ 21. Rg2  Nxe3+ 22. Kg1  Nxg2 but the King will die in that coffin corner eventually.",
        "19... Qh3+": "19...Qh3+.  It is now mate in three moves.",
        "20. Kg1 Qh1+ 21. Kf2 Qg2#": ""
