        "1... e5 2. Nc3 Qh4": "For some reason, this very aggressive black move always throws me off. He is planning Bc5, threatening mate on f2. Also, my c pawn is unprotected. I need to learn the appropriate response",
        "3. e3": "This is not it. Actually was mouse slip, I meant d4 to protect the pawn",
        "3... Bb4": "No idea what he's doing here, but he's doing it wrong",
        "4. g3 Qf6 5. Nd5 Qd6 6. Nxb4 Qxb4 7. b3 d6 8. Bg2 c6 9. Ne2 Nf6 10. O-O Bg4 11. h3 Bf5 12. e4": "Not the best move as I'm losing a pawn and bishop in the exchange",
        "12... Bxe4 13. Bxe4 Nxe4 14. d3 Ng5": "but, lucky for me he blunders",
        "15. Bxg5 O-O 16. d4 exd4": "He probably shouldn't have done that, opening the e file",
        "17. Nxd4": "Here I'm eyeballing that e7 square for my bishop. Would be nice to fork the queen and rook. Looking to swing my knight to f5",
        "17... Nd7 18. Nf5 Ne5 19. Be7": "Went early here, but it still nets me material",
        "19... Rfe8 20. Bxd6 Qb6 21. Re1 Nf3+": "I knew this was coming and felt fine about the exchange. ",
        "22. Qxf3 Rxe1+ 23. Kg2": "Until I blunder. I don't know why I didn't grab with my rook.",
        "23... Rxa1": "Ok, so now comes the magic. I have the black king heavily surrounded and I need to go for mate right away. I see one line, but it requires a sacrifice. I don't know if he'll take the bait, but it's my best shot",
        "24. Nxg7 Kxg7": "Boom! Mate in 3",
