        "1. e4": "this was a landmark game for me, as you can see i was rated 1730 against 1923 strong player. i managed to keep my cool to the end and force a win. a good example to lesser players on how to do so.\r\ncommon opening (kings pawn)",
        "1... c5": "sicillian defence one of the best ways to reply",
        "2. c4": "interestingly enough this move works as apposed to the more common 2 knf3 or even the d4 gambit ",
        "2... Nc6": "logical continuation",
        "3. Nf3": "was to be expected",
        "3... d6": "solidifying centre ideas",
        "4. Nc3": "centre ideas coming up",
        "4... Nf6": "symetrical with equal opportunity to win for both sides",
        "5. d4": "an aggressive move right on cue",
        "5... Bg4": "good defence to use in such situations, not always best",

        "14... Be7 15. Bxe7 Kxe7": "if the queen was to take then the king would still have moved aftyer the exchange so it was better for black to take with king sooner rather than later",
        "16. Bxd7 Qxd7 17. Qxd7+ Kxd7": "the rook idea was played well on time ",
        "18. Rxg7 Ke7": "logical as we enter an early endgame",

        "22... fxe4 23. fxe4 h6 24. Rf1": "the kingside will be used ",
        "24... Rg2 25. h3 Rg5 26. Rh4": "the exchange wins for black",
        "26... h5 27. Rd1 Rf8": "black is evening up the game",

        "39... Ke6 40. Re4e3 h4 41. Kc2": "at this point it would seem pretty drawish. white has a clear advantage but it is by no means easy to win from this position",
        "41... Rf4": "black must play correctly",
