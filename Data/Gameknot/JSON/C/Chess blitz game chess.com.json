        "7... Nf6 8. Bd3": "Develop my LBS to another good diagonal b1-h7 , preparing Qc2  building battery on the diagonal b1-h7 and avoiding moves like ...Ne4 . Using the fact that black didn't develop his DBS to e7 or d6 , I prefer to move my bishop first , with the idea after black will try to exchange bishops on f4 ,the knight on g1 will move to e2 and I will keep my pawn stricture on the kings side and I wont help black to develop his queen after Bxd6 . and if 8...Be7 than 9.Nf3 with the idea of ...Bd6 will be a waist of time since the bishop was already have been developed to e7 .",
