        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6": "Introducing the Philidor defense. More developing is 2...Nf6 (petrov defense) or 2...Nc6 (leads to the Ruy Lopez, Italian game , Scotch game...)",
        "3. d4": "White's most logical move.",
        "3... exd4": "This is black best move and it avoids complication. Also good is 3...Nf6.",
        "4. Nxd4": "4.Qxd4 is also playable.",
        "4... Nf6 5. Nc3 c6 6. Bd3 h6": "Better is 6...Be7 to allow castling.",
        "7. O-O Be7 8. Kh1": "Intending to advance kingside pawns.",
        "8... O-O 9. f4 Qc7 10. Nf3": "10.Nf3? Losing a tempo by moving the same piece twice while there is still another pieces not developed yet.",

        "15... Kh8": "The best. if 15...Kh7?? 16.e5+! wins a piece.",
        "16. Bd2": "May be better was 16.Be3 preventing black's next move. But i saw white's 19th move, so i played this.",
        "16... Qb6": "I think better was 16...Nc5!",
        "17. Na4 Qd4 18. Nc3 Nc5": "Does this win white's e4 pawn? Actually this move removes the defender from the knight on f6 as will be seen.",
        "19. Nb5": "19.Nb5!! if 19...cxb5?? 20.Bc3!! Qa4 21.Bxf6! {now the other knight doesn't protect it} gxf6? (black should play 21...Kh7 although he will lose after 22.Qg4 g6 32.f5 Rxe4 24.fxg6+ Kg8 25.gxf7_ Kxf7 26.Qg6+ Ke6 27.b3 Qa6 28.Bxe4) 22.Qg4! mates next.",
        "19... Qxb2": "Much better was 19...Nxd3! 20.cxd3 (not 20.Nxd4? Nf2+! 21.Kg1 Nxh3+ 22.Rxh3 Rxe4 when black is a pawn up) Qb6! to prevent 21.Nc7 forking the two rooks.",

        "22... Kh7": "Again forced. if 22...gxf6?? 23.Qg4! and black has to sacrifice his queen by Qg5 to avoid mate.",
        "23. f5": "23.f5!! this move allows 24.Qg4. If instead 23.Qg4 Re6 24.Bxg7?? Rg6 wins.",
        "23... Qb6": "23...Qb6!! to meet 24.Qg4 with 24...Qf2!! 25.Bxg7 Qxg3! 26.Qxg3 Bxg7 27.Rf1 Be5! and  black stands well.\r\n\r\nAlso bad for black is 23...Qc5? 24.Qh5! followed by Qxf7 wins.",
        "24. Rf1": "24.Rf1!! this destroys black's plan. Now black has to find another defense move to 25.Qg4.",

        "26. e5": "prevents 26...Qxg3. here my opponent resigns. \r\nAlso good is 26.Qxg7+?! Bxg7 27.Rxg7+ Kh8 28.Rxf7+ Kg8 29.Rxc7 dxe4 30.Rf4 h5 31.dxe4 Rac8 32.Rd7! c5 33.Rh4  Rc6 34.Bc3 Rb6 35.h3 Rh6 36.Rxb7 a6 37.Rd7 c4 38.e5 Rc8 39.g4 Rb8 40.g5 Rhb6 41.e6 Rb1+ 42.Kg2 Rc1 43.Bf6 Re1 44.Rxh5 Rb2+ 45.Bxb2 Re2+ 46.Kg3 Re3+ 47.Kf4 c3 48.Bxc3 Rxc3 49.f6 wins.\r\n\r\nnow let's see the continuation after 26.e5!",
