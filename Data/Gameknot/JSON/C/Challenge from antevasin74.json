        "9. Qa4+ c6": "My first blunder. White's Knight is no longer pinned",
        "10. Nxd4 Qg5": "Of course, a bad mistake must be followed by a horrendous blunder.",
        "11. Bxg5": "There is no real point in continuing at this stage so I resigned. My d-pawn and Knight are under attack. The Rook can pin my knight if desired. 12. Nxc6 bxc6 13. Qxc6+ Bd7 14. Qxa8+ and so on. This is a good example of how quickly a game can be lost with any sort of loose move. Always examine the position and look for your opponents reply before touching anything."
