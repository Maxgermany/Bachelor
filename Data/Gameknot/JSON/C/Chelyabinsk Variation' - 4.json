        "6. Ndb5": "This seems a good outpost for the knight as it threatens to cause problems on d6 or c7",
        "6... d6 7. Nd5": "Now he can either lose a rook to a fork, or exchange knights and then be forced to move his remaining knight",
        "7... Nxd5 8. exd5 Ne7": "pressuing the d pawn but notice that his king is now almost completely surrounded",
        "9. c4": "reinforces the d pawn, but more importantly opens the diagonal to a4 for my queen. I'm not sure if c3 would be better as that leaves my lsb with a better run should it be needed",
        "9... a6": "Although this attempts to move the knight I think it should have been done earlier (before I moved my c pawn). ",
        "10. Qa4": "Should he take the knight he will clearly lose the rook, however this could save the game for black. If he cannot open some space around the king I have Nd6",
        "10... Ng6": "Possibly the best move in the circumstances. I looked at this position for a while and wasn't clear if Nc7 or Nxd6 is the better move.",
        "11. Nc7+": "This at least would gain me a rook.\r\n\r\nBlack resigned. Interestingly we are still within the Gameknot Database here."
