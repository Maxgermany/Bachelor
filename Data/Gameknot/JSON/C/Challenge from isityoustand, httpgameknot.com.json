        "1. g3": "This is the Benko opening or the King's fianchetto opening, or Hungarian opening. It is not as rare as many think, but probably the 5th or 6th most common opening for White\n",
        "1... d5": "d5 is one of the best replies, taking control of the centre...all important in chess. Less obvious openings such as the Benko are based on letting the opponent take the centre initially, but attacking it later!\n",
        "2. Bg2": "Why not to the evident right away? The literature finds 2. Nf3 to be better. God only know why (I don't)\n",
        "2... Nf6 3. d3": "Why? Why not 3. d4. Or Nf3. Not bad but weak.\n",
        "3... e5": "The logical answer. If you don't take control of the centre, I will. I think black has some advantage now.\n",
        "4. Nf3": "About time. Good move!\n",
        "4... Nc6": "4. ...Bd6 might have been a little better?\n",
        "5. O-O Be7 6. Nc3": "A good natural move. 6. c4 might have been worth thinking about.\n",
        "6... O-O 7. Re1": "Too weak, I almost think 'too shy'. 7. e4 had been much better\n",
        "7... d4": "Black is immediately taking advantage of the 'shyness' - excellent move!\n",
        "8. Ne4 Nd5": "8. ...Nxe4 had been much better giving White an awkward double pawn\n",
        "9. c4": "This is a mistake, because b\u00b4Black can now move Nb6....\n",
        "9... dxc3 e.p.": "...however, Black takes en passant, which equalises the position\n",
        "10. bxc3 f5": "This may be a little questionable as it weakens Black's king position. Bf5 or Bg4 may have been better?\n",
        "11. c4": "Repositioning of the knight had been much better Neg5 or Ned2\n",
        "11... fxe4": "11. Nf4 had been much better\n",
        "12. cxd5": "Right! And now this game is very close to equalised\n",
        "12... exf3": "This is a mistake. 12. ...Qxd5 would have upheld the equality. Now White has a significant positional advantage\n",
        "13. dxc6": "By far the best move\n",
        "13... fxg2 14. Qb3+": "Qb3+!! Kxg2 had led to Qd5+ and loss of the game!\n",
        "14... Kh8 15. cxb7": "Right!\n",
        "15... Rb8 16. bxc8=Q Qxc8 17. Qd5": "?? For what purpose? Qc2 and Qc4 were on the path of winning the game\n",
        "17... Bf6": "Fortunately for White Black doesn't see the releasing move 17. ...Bb4! Now White is back in the lead...\n",
        "18. Qe4": "Probably the best move although Be3 was very good, too\n",
        "18... c5 19. Be3 Rb4 20. Qd5 c4 21. Qc5": "Rac1 had been better...\n",
        "21... Qb8 22. Qxa7": "After material again? a3 or dxc4 had been much stronger\n",
        "22... cxd3": "Q exchange had been better for Black\n",
        "23. Qxb8 Rfxb8 24. exd3 e4 25. d4 Ra4 26. Red1 Kg8 27. Rd2 Rba8 28. h4": "Excellent advance\n",
        "28... Kf7": "The game was drawn at this point. In my evaluation White had a winning position both positionally and with respect to material.\n"
