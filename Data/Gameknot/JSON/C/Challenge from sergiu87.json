        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6": "Damiano's defence (C40) This is a very poor defense because it exposes the king on the h5-e8 diagonal, weakens the king-side, and takes away the best developing square for the g8 knight.",
        "3. Nxe5": "A well known sacrifice. The best move for black here is 3...Qe7. This is the only way to regain the pawn, but at the cost of a serious positional disadvantage.",
        "3... fxe5": "A fatal mistake. White can now counter with a deadly kingside attack.",
        "4. Qh5+": "Exploits the h5-e8 diagonal. Black has two choices. 4...g6 is one option and is not advised because of the obvious fork of the king and the king-side rook (5. Qxe5+ Kf7 6. Qxh8...).",
        "4... Ke7": "The better of the two options, but the king is now wide open for attack.",
        "5. Qxe5+ Kf7 6. Bc4+ Kg6": "Black should have played 6...d5. It loses a pawn, but it at least keeps the queen away from f5, driving the king to the edge of the board.",
        "7. Qf5+ Kh6 8. d3+ g5 9. h4": "A decisive attack, and black must make the right move to survive. 9...d5 is the only way to prevent mate because it blocks the bishop from controlling f7, and it also threatens the queen. If black makes any other move, the following mate occurs.",
        "9... d6 10. hxg5+": "A decisive double check!",
        "10... Kg7 11. Qf7#": "A very common mate at a lower level of play. 9...d5 was necessary for black to take f7 away from white. A perfect illustration of the dangers of playing the Damiano's defense."
