        "8. Bxc5 b6 9. Be3": "White is one pawn up but has moved the bishop three times, so that it partly compensates for black",
        "9... Ne7": "Inaccuracy : 9... Nf6 would have been better ( if 10. e5 Nd7) In this place, with fiancheto, the knight blocks the queen.",
        "10. Qd2 c5 11. Bh6": "Bayonet attack",
        "11... O-O 12. h4": "White's intention is clear and black should beware about white attack on the kingside",
        "12... Bd7": "misatake (it blocks the queen and a control of the a8-h1 diagonal would have been better",
        "13. h5": "Whitte launches the attack",
        "13... b5 14. hxg6": "Black has 3 possibilities but none is satisfying.",

        "17. e5+": "Beginning of the mating sequence.",
        "17... Kf7": "Forced move (if 17... Kf5 18. Qg5 mate) - if the e knight had occupated another square, black would have had more options.",
        "18. Qxh7+ Ke8": "Forced",
        "19. Ne4": "White need more material for the mate (again, if black had set his LSB on the big diagonal, white would have had to find something else)",
        "19... Nf5": "preventing mate",
        "20. Qxg6+": "But white has now enough material available to do the job. ( Note : Black's LSB on d7, blocking the escape route for the king)",
        "20... Rf7": "The other option 20... Ke7 lead to mate even quicklier (21. Rh7+ Kf8 or Ke8 22. Qxf8+mate)",
