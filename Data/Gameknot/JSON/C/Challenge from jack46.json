        "4... O-O 5. O-O d6 6. b3": "This might make sense if he intends to fianchetto the bishop. As it is, it just weakens the long dark diagonal.",
        "6... c5": "Challenging the pawn that blocks that a1-h8 diagonal.",
        "7. c3": "This reverse-Slav idea would be stronger if the b-pawn was still at b2. Now there's no good square for the QB.",

        "8. Bd2": "He should still fianchetto the QB. It's no use at d2.",
