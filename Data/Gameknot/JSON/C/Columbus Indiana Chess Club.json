        "10... Be6": "Instead the computer likes  10... Nbd7 followed by Qe7.",
        "11. Bc4": "Best for black is 11... Bxe5 12. dxe5 Nfd7 13. O-O (13. Bxe6 Nc5 14. Bxf7+ Rxf7  is winning for black.) 13... Nc5 ",

        "12... Nbd7": "Instead 12. Nxc4 gives white a slight advantage.\nHere 13. O-O is necessary to get the king out of the line of fire, because Black can play dxe5 followed by Nc5 and Nd3+.  So 13. O-O Rc8 14. Qb3 Bxe5 15. dxe5 Nc5 16. Qg3 is equal.",
        "13. Qb3": "Now black is winning with 13... Bxe5 14. dxe5 Nc5, which according to the computer, gives black has a huge advantage.  However, understanding why this is winning is not easy.  This leads to many complicated lines linked to below.",
        "13... Qc7": "Although this looks like a reasonable move, the previously stated 13... Bxe5 14. dxe5 Nc5 is much better.",

        "14... Nxe5 15. dxe5 Bxe5 16. Bxe5 Qxe5 17. Nc3": "17. Na3 is a little better so as to later be able to go to c4, and to meet black's Ng4 with Qg3.",
        "17... Rfd8": "17. ... Ng4 first is also good.\n\nHere white could play 18. Qd1 to stop Ng4.",
        "18. Rad1": "Now Black is winning with 18... Ng4 19. g3 Qh5 20. h4 Ne5 which leads to a ton of complicated variations linked to below.",

        "19. Rfe1": "Black can still win with 19... Ng4 which also leads to some complicated lines linked below.",
        "19... Rad8": "Now 20. h3 is necessary.\n",
