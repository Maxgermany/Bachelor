        "4. c4": "Given the situation, I decieded to the play for a Queen's Gambit postion.",
        "4... Bg4": "  !?  Well, certainly not bad but a move such as this is, indeed, a sign of an over-aggressive player.  And to a certain degree even 3...c5 is a sign.",
        "5. h3 Bh5 6. Nc3 cxd4": "Well, before I had time to play Pawn-g4, thus, eliminating the Light-square Bishop my opponent had the game go in his direction; notice the placement of his Bishop.",

        "11... a6 12. Bg5 Be7": "A fair move on his part.  I believe, psychologically, my opponent thought Pawn-b5 was a bad moved and I did also.  But the more I looked at the position the more I thought Bishop-g5 was a bad move!",
        "13. Bxf6": "Now I have used 60-minutes and my opponent only used 7-minutes!",
        "13... Bxf6 14. Nxd7": "Now my strategy was based on the fact that the Black King hasn't castled yet.",
