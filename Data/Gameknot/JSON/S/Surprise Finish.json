        "2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6": "The usual first 5 moves.",
        "6. Be2 e5 7. Nb3 Be7 8. Be3 O-O 9. O-O Qc7 10. Rc1 Nbd7": "All normal stuff so far.",
        "11. f3 b5 12. a3 Nb6 13. Kh1 Be6": "I'm not sure what the benefit of voluntarily cornering the king at h1 accomplished. Sure, the a7-g1 diagonal is open, but white has a bishop safely on it at e3, and the king could always move after a check, since there are no forks or other dangers. It seemed premature for white to play 13. Kh1.",
        "14. Qe1 Nc4": "Forking the undefended bishop on e3 and the undefended pawn on b2, forcing white's reply.",
        "15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. Nd2 Rab8": "Seizing the half-open file.",
        "17. Rb1 d5 18. exd5 Nxd5": "Voluntarily isolating my own pawn on c4 seems questionable now in hindsight.",
        "19. Nxd5 Bxd5 20. Qf2 c3": "Since he's isolated, lets see about trading him off, maybe with the gain of a pawn in the process.",
        "21. bxc3 Qxc3": "And now black's queen forks two undefended pawns. One must die. White could try 22. Nb3, blocking black's queen from taking the pawn at a3, but the a3 pawn is doubly attacked, and black can simply reply 22. ... Bxa3, or even better, 22. ... Bxb3 23. cxb3 Rxb3 24. Rxb3 Qxb3 and now black still has two attackers on the a3 pawn and will win two pawns instead of one. White chose to resign at this point. I asked him why, since being just one pawn down in an otherwise equal middlegame is usually not cause for resignation, and he replied that he didn't think he could hold either pawn and would end up two pawns down, facing a black passed pawn, and with all black pieces attacking. In any case, it was short and sweet."
