        "1. e4": "Don't you just love those beautiful combinations we see in an attack against the enemy king? In this game we see Isaac Boleslavsky go down with the white pieces against Anatoly Ufimtsev, where some good attacking play and even a nice queen sacrifice lead to some pretty fireworks!",
        "1... e6 2. d4 d5": "French defence.",
        "3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6": "The Rubinstein variation.",
        "5. Nxf6+ gxf6": "Doubled pawns are usually a weakness, but in this case black hopes to benefit from the open g-file by eventually playing a rook to g8, especially if white castles kingside.",
        "6. Nf3 b6 7. Bb5+": "\n",
        "7... c6 8. Bc4 Ba6": "\n",
        "9. Bb3": "A key move. Is this is a mistake? Well, 9.Bd3 or even 9.Bxa6 would certainly have been better here.\n",
        "9... Qc7 10. c4 Nd7": "Preparing a queenside castle.",
        "11. O-O O-O-O 12. Qe2 Bd6": "The dark-squared bishop keeps a fixed eye on the h2-pawn. Still, you might say 12... c5 is worth considering here and perhaps even gives black a slightly better position.\n",
        "13. a4": "Now the position is about equal.",
        "13... Rdg8": "As expected.",
        "14. a5 c5 15. axb6 Qxb6 16. Be3": "White has active play here. 16.dxc5  [Worth some further analysis] Bxc5 17.Ba4 looks better for white.\n",
        "16... Bb7 17. dxc5 Nxc5": "17... Bxc5 [ Seems like a good alternative] 18.Ba4 and now 18...Rxg2 ! 19.Kxg2 Ne5 20.Bxc5 Qxc5 looks very interesting.\n",
        "18. Bd1 Rg4 19. Qd2": "This is where the real fun starts.",
        "19... Ne4": "! The first surprise!\n",
        "20. Qa5": "Ofcourse not 20.Bxb6? Nxd2 21.Nxd2 Rxg2  22.Kh1 Rxh2  5.Kg1 Rh1#. But what's black going to do now?",
        "20... Rhg8": "!The second surprise! If white takes the queen it's mate in three: 21.Bxb6? Rxg2  22.Kh1 Rxh2  23.Nxh2 Nxf2#! And if he tries to defend with 21.g3, black   can play a crushing 21...Nxg3 sacrifice: 22.hxg3 (22.Bxa6 Ne2  23.Kh1 Bxf3 mate.) 22...Rxg3  23.fxg3 Qxe3  24.Kh1 Qh6  25.Kg2 Rxg3  26.Kf2 Rg2 ! also leads to mate!",
        "21. Ne1": "..",
        "21... Rg4xg2+": "!!\n",
        "22. Nxg2 Nd2": "!! Fantastic! Though there's basically only one threat, there's nothing white can do about it. Again, taking the queen: 23.Bxa6 Rxg2  and 24...Rxh2  leads to mate while 23.f3 Qxe3  24.Kh1 Qh6 also leads to mate.\n",
        "23. Qd5": "White gives up his queen, only to avoid mate.\n",
        "23... Bxd5 24. cxd5 Qxb2": "The rest is simple..",

        "26... Bxh2+": "! Finally the bishop gets it's turn and white resigned. A magnificent performance by Anatoly Ufimtsev. (Dedicated to Reuben Fine: \"Thanks for all the 'lessons'.\")"
