        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!  Here is the third game in a series of 3 called Snap Mate.  Here my opponent, who has a rating of nearly 1600 falls into a snap mate after only 16 moves played.",
        "1... e5 2. Nc3": "2. Nc3 - I try another Vienna.  I dabbled in one with Coach Ion and lost that game.  Instead of f4 I try Nf3.",
        "2... Nf6 3. Nf3 d6": "3. ........ d6 - this is almost transposing into a Philidor.",
        "4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 c5 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. Bxd7+ Nbxd7 8. Nf5": "8. Nf5 - after an exchange of bishops on d7 I move my knight to an aggressive square putting pressure on the backward d pawn.",
        "8... Ne5": "8. ......... Ne5 - and black centralises her knight.",
        "9. Bg5 g6": "9. .......... g6 - tries to drive the f5 knight away but .......",
        "10. Nd5": "10. Nd5 - piling up on the pinned f6 knight and threatening a nasty bishop fork on f6 should the f5 knight be taken.  Black tries to wriggle out with a queen check on a5.",
        "10... Qa5+ 11. b4 cxb4 12. Bxf6 b3+ 13. c3 b2 14. Rb1 Rg8": "14. ........... Rg8 - up to here I have been following the database.  However, I look at the square f6 and my gut instinct tells me to analyse the board.  I therefore decide to exchange bishop for knight at e5.  This protects the c3 pawn for just one move.  I could have rounded up the pawn immediately but I think this is an improvement.  When playing through the analysis I noticed something else - the bishop taking on e5 also frees up the f6 square for my knight and bang we get a knight fork winning the g8 rook.  That is what will happen if black takes the f5 knight.  However, I also noticed that when I played out dxe5, Nf6 - the checkmate detector came on!  Wow, I thought.  I then set up conditional moves for both possible captures.  You can guess what black chose here, can't you?",
        "15. Bxe5": "The database game went like this in the game between phildo (1660) vs. ioaniuga (1712) in a gameknot team match:-\r\n\r\n1. e4 e5 \r\n2. Nf3 d6 \r\n3. d4 exd4 \r\n4.

        "15... dxe5 16. Nf6#": "16. Nf6# - yup, it is mate!  The pawn move onto the e file has opened up the d file for Glenda to control with fatal consequences for black!  A knight checkmate - cool!"
