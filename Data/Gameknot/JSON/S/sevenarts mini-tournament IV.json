        "59. Qh4+": "and i get check",
        "59... Kd3": "he flees",
        "60. Qe4+": "and there you go, forked check where he'd lose his last rook, and he resigns. \r\n\r\nhopefully that was interesting, i wanted to annotate a game with plenty of maneuvers, and in this case he fought hard and i had to come back from a collosal blunder to win anyway."
