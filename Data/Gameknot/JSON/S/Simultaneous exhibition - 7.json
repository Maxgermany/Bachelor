        "3. Bc4 Be7 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4": "White opens up the game favorably. Tarrasch has to get his King to safety and secure space for his pieces.",
        "5... Nf6": "Tarrasch clears the way for castling.",
        "6. Nc3 Nc6": "Both players are ready to tuck their Kings away...",
        "7. O-O O-O": "...and they do.",
        "8. h3": "Part one is done for Tarrasch: his King is secured. Now he needs to get some space for his pieces. The correct move is 8... N-Q2, to be followed up by ...B-B3 and ...N(2)-K4. Tarrasch's KR must guard the KBP against the pressure from White's KB.",
        "8... Re8": "A horrendous error in judgement, severely weakening Tarrasch's K-side. White promptly takes advantage.",
        "9. Re1": "Now 9...N-Q2??? would be a fearful blunder. The move to hold the position is 9...N-K4!",
        "9... Nd7": "One move too late. Now White annihilates Tarrasch's denuded K-side defenses.",
        "10. Bxf7+ Kxf7": "Forced.",
        "11. Ne6": "Presenting Tarrasch with a fearful choice. If he lets the Knight stay, he loses his Queen: if he captures it, he loses his King.",
        "11... Kxe6": "Tarrasch prays his opponet will overlook the two-move mate.",
        "12. Qd5+ Kf6 13. Qf5#": "He does not. A brilliant attacking game by White and a horrible game by Tarrasch, who just 4 years before had played a match for the World Championship!"
