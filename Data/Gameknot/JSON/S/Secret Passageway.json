        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nxe5": "Blitzes are great for experimental play. I get to play more tactically than I normally would in rated games. I suspect my opponent has taken that approach here as well.",
        "3... Nf6 4. exd5 Qxd5 5. d4 Bb4+ 6. c3": "Not wanting to trade pieces or double pawns I deny my Queenside Knight it's precious c3 post.",
        "6... Ba5 7. Be3 O-O 8. Nd2 Ne4": "I REALLY REALLY REAAAALLLLLYYYY wanted to play c4 here. But death and destruction await me along that path. (c4 Nxd2 or Kxd2, Bxd2 Qxe4 and I go down a pawn).",
        "9. Nxe4 Qxe4 10. Nf3": "Breaking the King's Bishop pin against the g2 pawn...",
        "10... Bg4": "... while allowing the Knight to be pinned to the Queen. Don't you just hate days like those?",
        "11. Be2 f5 12. O-O": "I was not enthusiastic about castling but the onslaught of pieces and annoying pawn positions became infuriating.",
        "12... f4": "I may have played as Black far too often. Such is the luck of the draw with online games. I am too defensive with the White pieces. Now my position is utterly stifled.",
        "13. Ng5 Bxe2": "Black expects a melee with an exchange of Queens.",
        "14. Qb3+": "Thank goodness for this escape tunnel. The game swings definitively in my favour via this play.",
        "14... Kh8": "This looks vaguely like a mating position. Sadly it was not.",
        "15. Nxe4": "I am well compensated nonetheless.",
        "15... Bxf1 16. Rxf1 fxe3 17. fxe3 Nc6": "Black develops his last piece while still possible. The b7 pawn is en prise. 18. Qxb7 Rxf1+, 19. Kxf1 Rf8+, 20. Ke2 Ne7, 21. Qxa7 Bb6 was definitely playable. But the mission is to capture the King, not eliminate minions. Anything less would not be quite as beautiful.",
        "18. Ng5": "Now this looks a bit more like a mating position. Still unclear though.",
        "18... Bb6 19. Nf7+": "Threatening mate. (... Kg8?? 20. Nd8+! wins)",
        "19... Rxf7": "Forced.",
        "20. Qxf7 h6": "Black's momentum has finally slowed down enough for him to consider basic defenses such as luft. ",
        "21. Qg6 Ne7 22. Qe4 Nc6 23. Rf7 Rd8 24. Qg6 Rg8 25. Kf1": "Now that the invading hordes have been dissipated I can get the King off the dark squares.",
        "25... Nd8 26. Re7 Nc6 27. Re8 a5 28. Rxg8+ Kxg8 29. Ke2 Ne7": "Sloppy play or broken spirit? It does not matter.",
        "30. Qe8+ Kh7 31. Qxe7": "Resignation."
