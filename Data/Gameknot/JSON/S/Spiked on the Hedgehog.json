        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nIn my penultimate annotated game against untateve I was talking about regaining some of the lost points from the low draw because I had some favourable games in my active games list which I was hoping to convert.  Here is one of them.  After yesterday's \"nightmare\" against the Master Mater (although let it be said, from all your kind comments the reason I lost that game was because although I had the right ideas I wasted a tempo early on by forking Freddy's Q + R on c7 and it was enough to cost me the game - so it seemed my performance was FAR FROM BEING HORSE DUNG!) it was nice to wake up to a white flag.   In this game I find myself in a closed Ruy Lopez and become passive and find myself facing a mating attack.  My opponent once had a rating in the 1600s before he suffered from some timeouts and for a long time in the game he played to that level.  But in pressing his mating attack he made a big oversight.  Here is how the story unfolds.  My opponent kicks off with 1.e4.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "3. Bb5 - this is the move which characterises the Ruy Lopez.  Kasparov calls it the Spanish Torture.",
        "3... a6 4. Ba4 Nf6": "4. ...... Nf6 - the main line - development, development, development.",
        "5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5": "6. ....... b5 - the white lsb is driven back.",
        "7. Bb3 d6": "7. ....... d6 - supports e5 and keeps my options open as to where to put Fou Leblanc.  The square b7 seems thematic to this opening however.",
        "8. Nc3 O-O 9. Nd5 Na5 10. Nxe7+": "10. Nxe7+ - the first set of trades, Fou Lenoir goes for a knight.  Glenda recaptures.",
        "10... Qxe7 11. d3": "11. d3 - opens a line for white's dsb.",
        "11... Bb7": "11. ...... Bb7 - Fou Leblanc goes to b7 and connects the rooks.",
        "12. Bd2 Nxb3 13. axb3": "13. axb3 - another N for B trade.  The downside is that it opens the a file and ties a piece down to defending the pawn on a6.  It does however double up pawns on the b column and relieve the pressure on f7.",
        "13... Nd7 14. b4": "14. b4 - I play f6 in response to b4 because I want to prepare a possible c5.  This move just doesn't happen however.",
        "14... f6 15. Qe2 Qf7": "15. ....... Qf7 - preparing d5 instead.",
        "16. Nh4 d5 17. Nf5": "17. Nh5 - the first stage of white's attack.",
        "17... Kh8": "17. ....... Kh8 - Henry moves out of a possible pin on the g column.",
        "18. Qg4": "18. Qg4 - should Glenda move off the second rank then it is curtains for Henry.  The Witch will come down to g7 and I will cop Old Matey.  The knight must be driven from f5.  How do I do it?  I know but it will take several moves to accomplish.",
        "18... dxe4": "18. .......... dxe4 - I want to put Fou Leblanc back on his home square to pin the knight against the Witch and this is the first stage of the plan.  This pawn trade relieves Fou Leblanc of the defense of my d5 pawn.",
        "19. dxe4 Nb6": "19. ....... Nb6 - stage 2.  Clears the way for Fou Leblanc.",
        "20. b3": "20. b3 - white thinks I am going to play Nc4 so he plays this move to prevent this.  However it allows me to proceed to Stage 3 of my plan.  The knight is now pinned with 20. ........ Bc8.",
        "20... Bc8 21. Re3": "21. Re3?? - natural, this rook lift is planning to put pressure on my g7 pawn, but this little footman is to become a little blighter as far as white is concerned.  My position has been like a hedgehog, spikes with a soft underbelly.  Here the spikes prevail as the pawn moves to g6 piling up on the pinned knight on f5.  So my opponent is well and truly spiked on the hedgehog.",
        "21... g6 22. Nh6": "22. Nh6 - I expected this but calculated for it.  This will result in a queen trade and after the knight takes Glenda on f7 my rook will snaffle it and white will be relieved of a piece.  It makes me look like The Artful Doger here!",
        "22... Bxg4 23. Nxf7+ Rxf7": "23. ....... Rxf7 - A piece up.  Mission accomplished.  White decides to play on a few moves.  He attacks Fou Leblanc and leaves me with a decision to make.",
        "24. Rg3 Rd7": "24. ........ Rd7 - I decide not to move Fou Leblanc but to attack his dsb instead.  If he takes Fou Leblanc I take his dsb establishing the Bone in the Throat on d7.  If he moves his bishop out of the way I trade rooks on d1 which is even better!",
        "25. Be3 Rd1+ 26. Rxd1 Bxd1": "26. ....... Bxd1 - rook trade.",
        "27. c4 bxc4 28. bxc4": "28. bxc4 - I expected Bxb6 here but this would have resulted in me playing a move like cxb3!  This move would result in my b pawn reaching Glendadom.  I now take the pawn back with my knight and white waves the white flag pushing my rating back 2.4 points due north.  A good start to Sunday morning.",
