        "1. d4": "Have you ever won a best game prize dear reader? I have, once, with this game, a long, long time ago. As I received it, I was reminded that the late, great John Littlewood had not entered any of his games, and if he had, he almost certainly would have won this prize - as well as the prize he won for winning the tournament.",
        "1... Nf6": "I have played Andrew J Mort since then - I think there is at least one other game with him in my annotations. He is a few years older than me and at the time had a much higher grade. ",
        "2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5": "Standard Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence",
        "4. cxd5": "He plays the exchange variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence#Exchange_Variation:_4.cxd5_Nxd5_5.e4",
        "4... Nxd5 5. e4": "He grabs the centre.",
        "5... Nxc3": "I take.",
        "6. bxc3": "He takes back.",
        "6... Bg7": "I complete the fianchetto https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto",
        "7. Bc4": "He plays the old main line. For decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4\u2013f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. It was generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1\u2013h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside. Another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3, Qd2, and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White's centre, remove White's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by White.\n\nVladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are the leading practitioners as White, and \u013dubom\u00edr Ft\u00e1\u010dnik has had many fine results with the black pieces",
        "7... O-O": "I castle.",
        "8. Ne2": "He continues with his plan.",
        "8... c5": "I strike at the centre.",
        "9. O-O": "He castles. ",
        "9... Nc6": "I develop my knight, attacking d4 for the 4th time.",
        "10. Be3": "And he protects it.",
        "10... Qc7": "One of the 3 variations in the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence that is names after Vasily Smyslov, World Chess Champion from 1957 to 1958. However this move has rather been put out of fashion by 11. Rc1 Rd8 12. Bf4! so nowadays more common is an older line Bg4 11.f3 Na5 12.Bxf7+",
        "11. Rc1": "He develops his rook.",
        "11... Rd8": "I develop mine.",
        "12. f4": "He starts his king's side attack.",
        "12... Bg4": "I pin his knight on e2.",
        "13. f5": "He continues with his king's side advance.",
        "13... Na5": "I attack his bishop, daring him to take on f7. Later I did have a game which continued with 14.\tBxf7+\tKxf7\n15.\tfxg6+\tKxg6, the point being 16. Nf4+ can be met with Qxf4!",
        "14. Bd3": "But he played a more sensible move.",
        "14... Nc6": "This move is a mistake, I was rather hoping for 15.\tBc4\tNa5\n16.\tBd3\tNc6 and draw agreed.",
        "15. fxg6": "But he plays this.",
        "15... hxg6": "I take back.",
        "16. Bc4": "Attacking f7",
        "16... e6": "Protecting.",
        "17. Bg5": "Attacking my rook. Find black's next move.",
        "17... cxd4": "Would you have played this? I felt it was best and still do! Fritz agrees!",
        "18. Bxd8": "He takes the rook.",
        "18... Rxd8": "I take back.",
        "19. cxd4": "He takes back. At the time I thought it was a mistake as I win back the exchange and end up a pawn up. I thought it was better for him just to lose the second pawn so I end up with bishop and two pawns for the rook. However my version of Fritz seems to think it is the best move.",
        "19... Bxd4+": "At the time I thought this was clearly best, winning back the exchange, but Fritz tells me Nxd4 was better.",
        "20. Kh1": "The king moves out of the way.",
        "20... Be3": "Bishop moves in, attacking the rook on c1 and discovering an attack on the queen.",
        "21. Qc2": "So the queen moves.",
        "21... Bxe2": "All those years ago I gave myself an exclamation mark for this move. I am not sure why. Fritz prefer the immediate BxRc1",
        "22. Bxe2": "He takes back. As Fritz points out, it is better to recapture with the queen. Can you see why dear reader?",
        "22... Bxc1": "I take the rook. As Fritz points out it would have been more accurate to first play 22.....Rd2! which more or less forces 23. Qc4 and then 23....Rd4! and after the queen moves, capture the rook on c1 and black has improved the position of his rook.",
        "23. Qxc1": "He takes back. I am just a clear pawn up here. ",
        "23... Qa5": "Attacking a2. Not really bad, but Fritz prefers Rd4",

        "27... Qd4": "Again, offering the exchange. Bc4 and e4 are threatened too.",
        "28. Qc2": "So this is forced. ",
        "28... Qd2": "Again threatening the exchange of queens. Fritz prefers Qe3.",
        "29. Qb1": "He avoids again.",
        "29... Qb4": "I offer the exchange again. Fritz prefers Ne5",
        "30. Bb5": "He finally allows the exchange of queens.",
        "30... Qxb1": "So I take.",

        "33. Rc1": "He attacks c6",
        "33... Rxe4": "But he can't take it right away as 34. Rxc6?? Re1#",
        "34. h3": "So he prevents back rank mates.",
        "34... Ra4": "2 clear pawns up now!",
        "35. Rxc6": "He takes.",

        "39... Ra1": "I make way for the pawn to advance again.",
        "40. Kg4": "He now realises that he can't come across.",
        "40... a2": "So I advance again.",
        "41. g3": "He shuffles his pawn",
        "41... Kg7": "My king comes up.",
        "42. Kh4": "He sorts of wastes a move.",
        "42... Kh6": "And I stay near his king. I have an easy winning plan of driving his king to the f file and then playing Rf1+ followed by a2-a1=Q White resigned. Thank you for reading. Please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two. Until next time, dear reader!"
