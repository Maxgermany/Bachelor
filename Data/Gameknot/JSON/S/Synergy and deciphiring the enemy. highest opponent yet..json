        "1. d4": "Good Evening friends and chess lovers this game has given me a new highest rated opponent defeated. Id appreciate all comments where i could have replied better. although this was a win i played Crunched the entire game it was scary!",
        "1... e6": "i hosted this game therefore i couldnt pick a e4 opponent to use my regular nimzowitsch and in the passed i liked going the old benoni with c5 but most whites know to follow with d5 and i grow tired of facing that situation.\n\nis e6 here first a good opener to then go c5? i only tried it once in the passed and won that game too but it can offer a crunched game",
        "2. e4": "uncharted territory already in the last game i opened with e6 my opponent did not reply e4.",
        "2... c5": "i decide to still go for c5. is this a mistake vs 2.e4? but i also realise that because of his e4 its as if i had started with c5 anyway and ill face the d5. i guess theres no way out of it lol i hate d4 starters!",
        "3. d5": "anticipated reply i try to control tempo a bit by replying nf6, id rather he take e6 and i take back with pawn on f7 in the future. and nf6 forces him to play towards that hanging pawn",
        "3... Nf6 4. dxe6 fxe6": "he gave me the exchange i wanted",
        "5. e5": "anticipated reply , here i studied for a while and thought he would start making my knight dance i cant lose too much tempo to such behaviour",
        "5... Nd5": "decide to place my knight on d5. i thought if he went c4 i would go nc6 is that a good spot for him on that reply?",
        "6. f4": "unanticipated reply. blocks off his black bishop. \n",
        "6... a6": "i decide to restrain his white bishop to also play b5",
        "7. Bc4": "the antics are starting. regularly i love trading knights for bishops. but obviously this is a losing exchange so i have to retreat the knight.  i asked about nc6 earlier. but i decided to keep the knight alive and if he keeps pressuring the knight on the next move i will pressure his bishop in reply",
        "7... Nb4": "and so i keep him active with the possible c2 fork in future. ",
        "8. Nf3": "hmm unanticpated reply here. i was expecting pressure on my knight. seeing as im controlling the d4 square and that he blocked his bishop from going left side this knight currently doesnt scare me. i decide to push the bishop away so i can send my knight back to d5 and im going queen side attack. if i can muster one. i felt a regular king side castle was safe and the h and g pawns are still aligned",
        "8... b5": "gaining space",
        "9. Be2 h6": "here i decide to give his knight only 1 option i was planning on developing my dsb after his castling for a check. i can predict he will castle now and i will reply with c4 to be able to safely place my knight on d5",
        "10. O-O c4 11. b3": "here this was unanticipated. and i thought if i let him capture my pawn will become isolated and its 2 pawns for 1. so im forced to take which is ok. i thought this was just putting off my attack for 1 move. i was planning on taking out his black bishop on e3 with a forced fork with my knight on his queen and rook. and i was hoping his reply after my DSB was on e3 would be g3 to reinforce the pawn and i would activate my LSB on b7 pinning the knight.",
        "11... cxb3 12. axb3 Bc5+": "get a free development. set up the bishop angles hopefully",
        "13. Kh1 Nd5": "plan my attack on c3",
        "14. c4": "this was ok i thought. the next moves will be forced and i will take his pawn now and leave him with 1 isolated pawn on the c file or b file if he retakes with his bishop",
        "14... bxc4 15. bxc4 Ne3": "hes kinda forced to swap out his dsb",
        "16. Bxe3 Bxe3 17. Qd6": "ouch un anticpated reply. he didnt do g3! he also prevents my castling. here i decide to take a big risk. i can see taking his f4 pawn opens a door for his rook. but i also judge that if i take the lead by 1 i can maybe look to start swapping out, this guy is ranked 300 elo higher than me for sure he has tricks up his sleeves. and i wasnt paying attention too much yet a bit to my demise lol i was busy being \"cute\"",
        "17... Bxf4 18. Nd4": "here i thought for a long time. and i saw all his angles. with fights on e7 with checks from the white bishop on e5 and my hanging black bishop. all of a sudden im in deep doo doo. i told myself i dont want to swap out queens with a hanging bishop,",
        "18... Qg5": "i thought this was the most reasonable reply. told myself if he checks with his lsb well swap out bishops. and it temporarily protects my DSB",
        "19. Nf3": "when he blocked his rook i told myself the best way to get out of this situation is to swap out queens and itll relieve alot of stress",
        "19... Qe7": "i was even willing to give up my castling",
        "20. c5": "hmm to my surprise unanticipated reply lol. i still said screw it queens off!",
        "20... Qxd6 21. exd6": "ouch this is getting scary",
        "21... O-O": "told myself lets get out of dodge and castle ",
        "22. Nh4": "here i thought i could maybe attack his rook top right corner. but the fork hes heading to with his knight on e7 is too dangerous and i was able to see this a while back. and i start analysing end game. i have to get my LSB and knight into play. my A file rook will just sit in his file and watch the a pawn climb.  but i have to look to simplify out to make it easier to race the A pawn",
        "22... Bg5": "i also judged that i cannot let the D pawn get to e7. this is in forsight to also play nc6.  he is forced to swap out rooks here i got a checkmate looming or if he develops his knight i would swap out the rooks myself anway. i think he took it upon himself to reposition my king",
        "23. Rxf8+ Kxf8 24. Ng6+ Kf7": "i didnt have time to do nc6 so i need double couverage on e7 still",
        "25. Bh5": "had he deployed his B file knight first i still had the time to reply nc6 i was glad i had looked a good amount of moves forward to get ready for this. my oponent has a 2:1 win/loss ratio with a 1700 elo. im about 50/50 with 1450 elo ish atm. my opponent  was at 5 mins a move. so he had a lot of talent but he didn't take the time to think, he was playing off confidence i could tell",
        "25... Nc6 26. Nc3": "now if he comes in with the rook i get screwed i have to retreat my king but its ok i still have double coverage of e7",
        "26... Bf6 27. Rf1 Kg8 28. Ne4": "hmm its getting crowded in here and i see im going to have to give back a pawn to do an effective defense. but we will be simplifying out more units. so i loved this. i can soon start racing my A pawn",
        "28... Bb7": "out of all the moves i thought this to be my best. all i had to do was wait for him now. if he moves his knight to e7 ill just move my king and let him capture my knight if he wants and recapture with my LSB still denying his pawn the e7 square",
        "29. Nxf6+ gxf6 30. Rxf6": "the fortold pawn give away",
        "30... Kg7": "but the king can defend himself muahahah!",
        "31. Rf2": "forced to retreat the rook",
        "31... a5": "off to the races",
        "32. Rb2 Nb4": "lets let my LSB in play. and i even see a simplification from here with a fork on his rook. i was playing 3-5 moves ahead constantly my opponent would play his move and basically disconnect. this entire game played under 20 mins id say. where i took 15 mins and him 5 ><",
        "33. h4": "here i think was a big mistake by him and a time gainer by me. i will get the simplification im looking for",
        "33... Be4": "kick the knight obviously he wont let me take not going to lose bishop + knight just for my bishop",
        "34. Nf4 Nd3": "and fork for simplification!",
        "35. Nxd3 Bxd3 36. Rb7": "here after i saw this i started playing ahead and saw that my pawn gets there first. he also has no direct way to help with his LSB",
        "36... Kf6": "dont want him to gain time when he takes the pawn i also did this to invite a rook check to Rf7#. i judged his best chances of a queen is if his rook was on the E or C files so getting the f check is wanted",
        "37. Rxd7": "takes the pawn!",
        "37... a4": "the pressure race!",
        "38. Rf7+": "the check!",
        "38... Ke5": "but i also looked now my king could eat both pawns!",
        "39. d7": "that changes nothing for atleast 3 moves",
        "39... a3": "scoot scoot",
        "40. Rf2": "i think he had a better chance with Rf1  this move really delighted me. i could now anchor my bishop!",
        "40... Bb1": "its getting tough for him",
        "41. c6": "here if i go with my pawn and he swaps out rook for pawn itll get really dicey to do something to his pawns. but i had looked ahead and i saw my king had the time to defend and his lsb couldnt do crap!",
        "41... Kd6": "here i thought he would check me and he did!",
        "42. Rd2+ Kc7": "i think he saw the futility of the situation now.  he actually stayed connected, the \"thinking...\" words came up for a long long time.  i had already played through this part a long long time ago ><   in my early games i had lost a few for not analysing the end game pawn race, i concluded his analysis came too late.",
        "43. Bf7": "this move is too late that e6 from move 1! i guess it is a good start after all hehe.",
        "43... a2 44. Rxa2": "i was happy with myself at this stage.",
        "44... Bxa2 45. Bxe6 Bxe6": "oponent resigned. i think he gave up prior the last 2 exchanges.\n\ncomments appreciated. this was a really rough game! i hope i didnt do too many mistakes. please offer better lines if possible"
