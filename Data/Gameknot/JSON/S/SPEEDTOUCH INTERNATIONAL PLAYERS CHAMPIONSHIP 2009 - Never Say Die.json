        "1. d4": "Once again, a never-say-die attitude pays dividends :-)  My last game in the 2009 Championship.  When we started this game jklarl's rating was way higher than mine, so I started with the strategic 1. d4, as I feel that slower styled games give me a better chance against better players.  Crash bang wallop open games tend to end up with me being the walloped one.",
        "1... Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5": "The Grunfeld.  A good, counter-attacking response by Black.",
        "4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Nxd5": "? Not sure why I diverted from the book's 5. e4 Nxc3 here.  This does not work out well.",
        "5... Qxd5 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. Bf4 O-O 8. e3 c5 9. Rc1": "? This gives up material unnecessarily.",
        "9... cxd4 10. exd4 Qxa2 11. Bc4 Qxb2": "Black has two remote passed pawns for nothing.  All he needs to do is swap off all the pieces and Bob's your uncle.",
        "12. O-O Nc6 13. Rc2 Qb6 14. Be3": "Everything is centring around my isolani on d4.",
        "14... Qd8 15. Rd2 Bg4 16. h3 Bxf3 17. Qxf3": "One down, five to go..",
        "17... Qc7": "Gets the Q off the same file as my rook and prepares to let a rook onto the d-file.",
        "18. Rfd1": "I try to turn my isolani into a battering ram.",
        "18... e6 19. Qe4": "I don't remember my actual thinking behind this move but I suspect it was so that when I advance the d-pawn, the Q won't be attacked by ...Ne5.",
        "19... Rfd8 20. d5 Ne5 21. Be2 exd5 22. Rd2xd5 Rxd5 23. Rxd5 f5": "The swaps have helped Black again.  Advancing my pawn may not have been so bright.",
        "24. Qf4 Qc3 25. Rd1": "to prevent ...Qe1+",
        "25... Qc2 26. Bf3 g5 27. Qg3": "... if 27. Qxg5 Nxf3+ and White's rook falls",
        "27... f4": "a nasty fork",
        "28. Bxf4 Nxf3+ 29. Qxf3 gxf4 30. Rd7": "activating the rook and freeing the Q from defending it.  White could have resigned at this point ... but hope springs eternal :-)",
        "30... Qc1+ 31. Kh2 Qc6 32. Qg4 Qf6 33. Rxb7": "a welcome pawn :-)  Only a bishop down now ...",
        "33... a5 34. Qf3": "hoping for the swindle Rxg7+ followed by Qxa8",
        "34... Rf8 35. Ra7": "Nimzo would have been proud of this move: the monster must be contained!",
        "35... Qe5 36. Ra6": "White had to move but had nothing constructive.  This move retains the control of the a-pawn and cedes nothing else.",
        "36... Qb5 37. Ra7": "ditto",
        "37... h5 38. Rb7": "harassing Black's Q for want of anything better to do.  White's plan at this point is merely to hassle Black as much as he can.",
        "38... Qc5 39. Rd7": "threatening to fork the wing pawns with Rd5, Q moves",
        "39... Rf5 40. Rd2": "defending f2 so that the Q can move",
        "40... a4": "? falling for a fork",
        "41. Qa8+ Kh7 42. Qxa4 Kg6 43. Qe8+ Kh6 44. Qe6+ Rf6 45. Qe4 Qc6 46. Rd5 Bf8 47. Qe5": "! piling up the pressure on Black's h-pawn, with potential mate threats to follow.",
        "47... Qxd5": "?! Black returns extra material but did he have anything better?",
        "48. Qxf6+": "?! not realising the strength of my previous threat, I thought Black was up to something devious and decided to keep Queens on, accepting Rook and Bishop, rather than Q, as I didn't fancy the complications of Q vs R&B.  This worked out rather well but I think I should have been more materialistic at this stage.",
        "48... Kh7 49. Qxf8 f3": "?  Gives up a pawn for nothing.  Now I'm suddenly winning!",
        "50. Qxf3 Qxf3": "Compounds the error.  Black's only hope rested with keeping Queens on board.",
        "51. gxf3 h4": "restraining my K",
        "52. f4": "providing him with an escape hatch",
        "52... Kh6 53. Kg2 Kg6 54. Kf3 Kf5": "Black seizes the opposition but it's no use when my pawns control g4, g5 and e5",
        "55. Ke3": "and Black resigned because his King gets pushed backwards and White queens a pawn or two."
