    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "I am in the mood for any kind of Queens pawn game.\n",
        "1... d5": "Black plays a Classical response.\n",
        "2. c4": "Playing for some kind of Queens Gambit.\n",
        "2... c6": "Interesting, black plays towards what I expect will be a Semi-Slav, which provides a solid pawn formation for black and is usually a tough position to crack by white. The position now is a Slav because ...e6 has not been played yet.\n",
        "3. e3": "I play an out of sequence move from the mainline of the Semi-Slav, although I did not know this until after the game because I played it instictively. The mainline move, in sequence is 3.Nf3, which plays against e5 weak until ...Nbd7 is played, and is played to prepare for short castling, in a gambit manner because e3 is not played yet usually, so the c4 pawn would hang without bishop assistance.\n",
        "3... Nf6": "Black plays the Semi-Slav moves in sequence, and this is a book move.\n",
        "4. Nc3": "Another out of sequence move from the mainline. Usually Nf3 is played before Nc3. In my view of the position I am playing Nc3 to prevent Qa5+ while developing the kingside.\n",
        "4... e6": "This completes the pawn structure for the Semi-Slav, a formidable obstacle for white.\n",
        "5. Nf3": "Its move 5 and I have obtained all the mainline moves of the Semi-Slav which are normally played as (1.d4 d5  2.c4 c6  3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6  5.e3), to obtain the standard position expected at this move.\n",
        "5... Nbd7": "Its book, but the knight appears to be in the way here to me because it is another obstacle for the c8  bishop, a thought I keep in mind as I create a strategy, which for me usually involves some kind of kingside attack.\n",
        "6. Bd3": "Still book, though I did not really know this at the time. I saw the bishop move as necessary to enable castling, even though there is the unwelcome ...dxc4 Bxc4 to contend with - I still find this move agreeable. The option to play cxd4 first, then develop the bishop is an option that can open a rook line on the c file, which I did not want because I like the constriction that black currently enjoys.\n",
        "6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5": "This is the last book move for the opening.\n",
        "8. Bb3": "The book move is 8.Bd3, which is a good line for the bishop, but I wanted it pulled in tight, so the destination will be c2 where the bishop can target h7 to good effect, and will keep the bishop off the queens d file, which I find preferable. A minimal factor is the bishop targets f7 in the event of e6 being pushed, but this is only a temporary consideration.\n",
        "8... Bd6": "An akward appearing move because the bishop hangs openly, but it is safe due to the lack of an open d file and able knight attacks. This is a good position for the bishop where it targets h2 with aggresive intent.\n",
        "9. Bc2 O-O": "Black creates a safe position from which to engage strategic plans.\n",
        "10. Ng5": "!? White decides that there is some room for aggresion before castling due to the lack of mobility and coordination of the black pieces. Some activity begins to focus on h7, which should send a flag to black. I was really expecting perhaps a weakening move of ...g6 in response to this move, but black prefers a lesser strategy.\n",
        "10... Qc7": "I see the intent, but the idea is not recommended due to opening the h file which can fast become a liability to black due to the activity that white can generate.\n",
        "11. a3": "I make a waiting move, which also prevents ...Bb4 or ...b5-b4, in anticipation of ...Bxh2 ?\n",
        "11... Bxh2": "? Not outright losing, but it enables white to have a tactical field day on the black castle.\n",
        "12. Bxh7+": "! Expecting NxB, the bishop leads the attack.\n",
        "12... Nxh7 13. Nxh7": "Not 13.Qh5?? because of 13...Nhf6 and black is fine.\n",
        "13... Kxh7 14. Qh5+": "Gaining back a bishop size chunk of material.\n",
        "14... Kg8 15. Rxh2": "+/= White has a bit of an edge due to the mating threat, but it is not secure just yet because black can play out of the trap, so white must find the correct continuations to secure the win.\n",
        "15... f5": "An essential move that gives the king an escape hatch in the event of check by the queen.\n",
        "16. Bd2": "A seemingly benign move, but it is necessary to bring in another piece to play for a win, and activating the rook by castling long seemed a good a plan as any.\n",
        "16... Nf6": "Black plays aggresively towards the queen, gaining some tempo and taking away check possibilities by white on the h4 diagonal, and taking away Qh7+, which gives white only 1 good square for the queen at h4 which does not find the point of a bishop.\n",
        "17. Qh4 e5": "With the white king in the center, black plays to open the center which can be used effectively by queen and rooks in a counter attack.\n",
        "18. Ne2": "The knight now provides for d4, and is planned to move to g5 where it will provide additional mating threats when coordinating with the queen.\n",
        "18... exd4": "Black continues with the plan, but the downside is that exd4 does not have to be played, so the king will remain behind pawn cover after Nxd4.\n",
        "19. Nxd4 Re8": "A little aggresion towards the king by the rook, but it is lacking a partner to create a substancial attack.\n",
        "20. Nf3": "Next stop g5 to take f7 and h7 from the king.\n",
        "20... Ne4": "The idea is (21...Nxd2  22.Kxd2 Qd6+) with an attack to keep white busy.\n",
        "21. Bc3": "!? Attempting to swindle black positionally by offering up a menacing bishop in exchange to the knight, which will enable Ng5 for white, and a continuation of threats.\n",
        "21... Nxc3": "? Even though the bishop was leaning on g7, h8, it was not overly dangerous, and this exchange favors white.\n",
        "22. bxc3": "It is not possible to effectively play 22.Ng5 to attempt mate because of 22...Kf8 and black escapes, so material equality is maintained as a better alternative.\n",
        "22... Kf8 23. Qg5": "Not a particularly large looking move, but it does offer clearance for Rh8+\n",
        "23... Qd7": "Black seeks counterplay on the d file, and sets up the threat of ...Qd3 where ...Qxc3+ will gain a rook, unless prevented.\n",
        "24. Rh8+": "Here I begin fumbling around with the position a little so that I can get my pieces organized. Note that this move will put the rook in front of the queen for later operations.\n",
        "24... Kf7 25. Rh7": "It almost looks like nothing was accomplished, but the rook is now in front of the queen in the following attack, and next the queen will vacate the g5 square, to be used by the knight in a coordinated attack.\n",
        "25... Kg8": "Avoiding the threatened Rxg7+ which gains a queen for white.\n",
        "26. Qh4 Qd3": "Black tries to punch first with ...Qxc3+, but is behind by just one tempo. White has a stronghold on the position and can make effective use of active pieces. Black is almost playing 2 pieces down due to the bad bishop and trapped rook on a8. Neither of those factors are permanent, but they exist now.\n",
        "27. Rh8+": "Forcing one response.\n",
        "27... Kf7 28. Ng5+": "The knight is the correct tool for the job because it enables a greater attack than a simple queen check. The knight, queen, and rook have a great control of squares which enable further quality attacks against the lone king.\n",
        "28... Kf6": "?! I have doubts about this move relative to 28...Kg6, but with all the checks available by white it may not really matter.\n",
        "29. Ne4+": "! A double attack leaving few choices, non pleasing to black.\n",
        "29... Kf7": "Walking into a semi-spectacular set of tactics.\n",
        "30. Qh5+ g6": "It almost seems dangerous, but the pawns bark is worse than its bite.\n",
        "31. Qh7+": "Giving the king only one option at e6, the worst possible place for the king due to the approaching tactic.\n",
        "31... Ke6 32. Nc5+": "! White gains a free queen. There was a better alternative, which was show by Toga analysis, after my analysis, where white attains mate more rapidly. At the time I had briefly touched on part of the alternative line, but the very enticing fork was just too irresistable, so I played it instead of continuing calculations on the other line.\nAlternative variation: 32. Rxe8+ Kd5 33. Qf7+ Be6 34. Qxe6#\n",
        "32... Kf6 33. Nxd3": "The game is won by white, the remaining is a matter of technique, some of which I found pleasing.\n",
        "33... Bd7 34. Rxe8": "Necessary to make positional gains.\n",
        "34... Bxe8": "?? Bad due to pinning tactics against the bishop.\n",
        "35. Qh8+": "Makes the most use of blacks prior inferior move.\n",
        "35... Ke7": "This move can allow the rook to leave the back rank, but unfortunately the rook is not on an open file, and so this move only offers some additonal security to the bishop for the moment.\n",
        "36. Qe5+": "The idea is to bring the knight safely to c5.\n",
        "36... Kf7 37. Nc5 Kg8 38. Ne6": "An obvious attempt at Qg7#, which is expected not to be gained, but it does allow for good followup moves from the knight now that it is closer to the attack.\n",
        "38... Kf7 39. O-O-O": "Activating the rook. Castling was not absolutely necessary, but it looked cool and accomplishes the necessary repositioning of the rook to gain control of d8, preventing ...Rd8 by black.\n",
        "39... Rc8 40. Rd6": "An accurate move, the rook is placed where it is most needed.\n",
        "40... Ke7": "Not a helpful move.\n",
        "41. Ng5+ Kf8 42. Qf6+": "Closing the net.\n",
        "42... Kg8 43. Ne6": "There are probably alternatives to this move, but this provided the most fun.\n",
        "43... Rc7": "Prevents Qg7#\n",
        "44. Rd8": "! A noticeable feature to the position is that the king is unable to lend assistance to the bishop, and with this move the rook threatens check followed by mate from Qh8#\n",
        "44... Kh7": "There really is nowhere to run, the king leaves one back rank alley to find desperation in a flank side alley formed by knight and g6 pawn.\n",
        "45. Rxe8": "This is all that is needed to enable the finishing move of Qh4#, or other mating alternatives.\n",
        "45... Rb7": "There are no saving moves.\n",
        "46. Qh4#": "I have not played against many Semi-Slav positions before and had to intuit my way through the moves. I really am not sure how good my chances would be against black if the less than steller 11...Bxh2 had not been played. I am glad it was because it provided for some interesting tactical play.\n"
