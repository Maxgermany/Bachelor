        "6. d4 Nf6": "Nobody plays d5, but it has to be controlled anyway. ",
        "7. Nf3 Bf5 8. Bd1": "I won a nice game with this position, but my opponen was not so strong...",
        "8... e6 9. O-O h6": "I won with a pawn storm on the kingside. Trying to remember the moves...",
        "10. Ne2": "Ah, but this is new. And good. ",
        "10... g5 11. Ng3 Bg6": "Bad move. The bishop must go directly to h7, I will lose tempoes. ",
        "12. Ne5 Bh7 13. c3 Bd6 14. f4": "This is the good move by white. ",
        "14... Rg8": "And the wrong defence, but I just didn't see it. ",

        "16... Bxe5": "Maybe I had to keep the bishop, but I was discouraged. ",
        "17. dxe5 Nd7": "...and I was aiming for this. ",
        "18. Rh6 Bd3 19. Rh5": "So more piece exchanges are in sight. I cannot allow myself to lose plainly a pawn. ",
        "19... Nxe5 20. Rxg5 O-O-O": "Bg3 was probably wiser. I just let by mistake the knight hanging. I was trying to make something of the hanging white's lsb, but it was impossible. And, in the process (remember it is a blitz, and I had few time left), I didn't see his knight...",
        "21. Rxg8": "But, incredibly enough, he didn't either!",
        "21... Rxg8 22. Bf4": "Now I thought I will lose soon. ",
        "22... Nc4 23. b3 Nb6 24. Be3 Nd5": "It seems a nice outpost, but for c4. Again, I was trying to exchange pawns. but he is too smart.",
        "25. Bd4 b6": "What else? But it creates a fatal weakness at c6. ",
        "26. Bf3 Rg5": "Probably the plain c5 was better. I didn't want my f pawn isolated. ",
        "27. Rd1 Bg6 28. c4": "Ne7 is impossible due to the bishop fork, but the alternative is not much better. ",
        "28... Nb4": "a3 and I'm lost. Nc2, Bxc6, and I'm near to a mate net. ",
        "29. Bf6 Ra5": "At least a3 is covered. ",
        "30. Bc3": "Another exchange, but this one is half-good for me. I would have gone for another piece coming in, but it must be said that he is really weak on a2, and will lose it. Be4, to contest my bishop's action, is one move too far to play Rd2, controlling everything. Rd8+ leads nowhere if the Knight defends c6... so, incredibily enough, I have a game, for some moves. And his best try is by losing the bishop pair. ",
        "30... c5 31. Bxb4 cxb4": "I saved the c6 pawn, even if it is doubled. ",
        "32. Be4": "More exchanges. But I had to take my chance. Now, to isolate the pawns is better than to bring his other knight in. It will go for my f7 pawn. I will take a2, yes, but his pieces will be more actives than mine's.",
        "32... Rxa2 33. Bxg6 fxg6": "it will take some more moves for the knight to become dangerous.",
        "34. Rd3 a5": "Only chance, very faint. Of course, Rd6 wins. Kc7 must have been better. ",
        "35. Ne4 a4": "Better than nothing. ",
        "36. bxa4 Rxa4 37. Rb3 Kd7 38. c5": "Clever, I cannot exchange the pawn. No problem. ",
        "38... Kc6 39. cxb6 Kxb6": "Incredibly enough, the knight cannot attack easily my pawns. ",
        "40. Kf2 Kb5 41. Nc3+": "Nd2 would have completely blockaded me. By exchanging rooks, I have some chances. ",
        "41... Kc4 42. Nxa4 Kxb3 43. Nc5+ Kc4": "if Nxe6, my b pawn cannot be stopped.",
        "44. Na4 b3 45. Ke2": "Now, if I can distract him and keep my king not too far from his pawns, I can have a chance. ",

        "47... Kd4": "Keeping him tied to the b3 pawn. ",
        "48. g3 e5": "He cannot take it. ",
        "49. h4 e4 50. Nb2 e3": "Now it becomes interesting. He is tied to either pawns, and while he takes them, my king will take his.",
        "51. g4": "I think that this is a big mistake. It makes his pawns weak from f4. But what else?",
