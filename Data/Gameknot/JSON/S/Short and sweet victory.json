        "4. Nf3 e6 5. e4": "White has a very kings indian style of center here.",
        "5... h6": "wants to avoid the pin on g5, but wastes time.",
        "6. Be2": "perhaps bd3 was better",
        "6... b6": "another pawn move. white has a nice center and a lead in development",
        "7. Be3 Bb7 8. Qc2": "supports the e4 pawn",
        "8... c5 9. d5": "This gains some space and locks blacks lsb in",
        "9... a6": "nother pawn move?? black is seriously behind in development, while white is about the finish development",
        "10. O-O": "White castles and connects his rooks finishing development.",
        "10... Qc7 11. a3 Ng4 12. Bd2 Nde5 13. Nxe5": "here i just though that taking was easier than kicking the other knight",
        "13... Nxe5 14. b4": "Perhaps this was a mistake",
        "14... cxb4 15. Qa4+": "Cant play 15.axb4 because it would lose the pawn on c4",
        "15... Kd8": "Black commits to not castling which will prove later as a bad choice",

        "22... g6 23. f5 Bg7 24. Nc6+ Kc7 25. fxe6": "Here i had a nice idea. IF 25... fxe6 25.cxe6 Qxc6 26.Rxf7+ and after king moves 27.Rxg7. This appears to leave the pawn on e4 for grabs, but if 27... Nxe4 it would be answered by Bf4 winning a piece.",
        "25... Qc8": "Blunder. This allows Rxf7+",
        "26. Rxf7+": "And my opponent resigns. At minimun hes going to lose his queen or get mated. Hope you enjoyed:)"
