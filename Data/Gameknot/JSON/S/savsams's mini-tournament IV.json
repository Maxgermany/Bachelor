        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. Bxc6": "I used to play this line quite a lot back then. I had picked it up from an article that I had read on Anti-Sicilian openings.\n\nThese days, I much less afraid of playing 4. d4. These days, I feel that the consequences for white of black responding cxd4 are not disturbing enough to justify Anti-Sicilian play.",
        "4... dxc6": "4. Bxc6, bxc6 is more usual and I think probably stronger. Here black has weakened its claim to the centre and opened the d file. \n\nThis is probably pretty playable (especially against weaker opposition?) but was this perhaps the first sign of over-confidence from black?",
        "5. O-O Bg7 6. d3": "Contorting to avoid cxd4.",
        "6... Nf6 7. Be3": "After exchanging the bishop with the knight and so achieving the doubled pawns on the c file, I now threaten to take black's undefended pawn and perhaps help remove the black's doubled pawn problem?\n\nNc3 probably better.",
        "7... b6": "I used threats in this game to illicit a response from my opponent, hoping that pressure would lead to an error.",
        "8. Nbd2": "Why not Nc3? - the bishop has lost a little bit of movement.",
        "8... Bb7": "Not a great move by black. With the doubled pawns, the white squared bishop does not look very threatening on b2.",
        "9. Qe2": "White is looking cramped. Only plus is that a lot of white's strength is building in the centre of the board.",
        "9... O-O 10. Rad1 Ng4 11. h3 Nxe3 12. Qxe3 Bxb2": "Black is now looking a fair bit ahead. The space on the board looks better suited for black's bishops than white's knights.",
        "13. Qh6": "I'm about to throw everything that I have into attacking h7.",
        "13... Bg7 14. Qh4": "Keeps the pressure on h7.",
        "14... e6 15. Ng5": "Threatens h7# - black has to respond.",
        "15... h6 16. Ndf3": "I was so keen to maintain the threat of h7# that I'm willing to lose material.\n\nNot an amazing strategy, what else is really on for white though?",
        "16... hxg5 17. Nxg5 Re8": "That was forced. Neither side is looking too great here. Black is maybe still a bit ahead but the exposed King is cause for concern (and proved decisive).",
        "18. Qh7+ Kf8 19. f4": "Protects white's knight from the Queen so it can stay deep. A simple f6 though and black can brush away that problem.",
        "19... f6": "f6 - should have been obvious.",
        "20. Nf3 Kf7": "I guess preparing to chase away white's queen with the rook.",
        "21. Nh4": "Again, I manage to find a threat to worry my opponent with.",
        "21... Rh8 22. Qxg6+": "It didn't worry him and I gain a pawn.",
        "22... Kf8 23. Nf3": "Black still ahead. White's rooks totally ineffectual.",
        "23... Rh6 24. Qg4 Bc8 25. e5": "Blocks e5.",
        "25... f5 26. Qg3 Qe8 27. c4 Qg6": "Queen exchange offered. Black probably wants rid of those pesky Queen attacks.",
        "28. Ng5": "Exchange not taken. A pretty nice square for white's knight to make home on.",
        "28... Rh5": "Black is willing to exchange a rook for a knight?",
        "29. Qf3 Bd7": "Black's bishops have found themselves closed in and ineffectual.",
        "30. d4": "cxd4 looks more palatable now... white's rook can control the open d flank and finally join the game.",
        "30... cxd4 31. Rxd4 Ke7": "Use's the King to protect the knight. Probably did not like the look of 31 .., Bc8 32 Qxc3.\n\nBlack probably expected me to follow with Rfd1 to create doubled rooks on the d flank. I don't think black even considered my next move.",
        "32. Rxd7+": "Rxd7!? - this became the winning move.\n\nPlanning 32 .., Kxd7 33. Rd1+ and later getting that rook onto d6. Just getting my pieces deep into black's territory. \n\nIf 32 .., Ke8 then 33. Qxc3 and I can still create options.\n\n32. Kf8 is less advantageous for white. Still worth grabbing the bishop though. ",
        "32... Kxd7": "It felt like forever waiting for my opponent to move. I thought the sacrifice was just a little too obvious. \n\nMore likely, it didn't really look too threatening for black.",
        "33. Rd1+ Kc7 34. Rd6 Qe8": "Blunder. Probably as important as the sacrifice in the outcome - but that's less romantic.",
        "35. Nxe6+ Kb7 36. Nxg7 Rxh3": "Black's rook commits reckless suicide.",
        "37. Qxh3 Qg8 38. Nxf5 Qxc4 39. Rd7+ Ka6 40. Qa3+": "Black resigned.\n\n40 .., Qa4 41. Qxa4#\n40 .., Kb5 41 Nd6#"
