        "1... Nf6 2. Nd2": "Looks a bit odd, but seems playable. ",
        "2... d5 3. e3 Bf5": "Nothing very unusual yet, just developing. Is this a London style defense perhaps?",
        "4. Ne2": "Now it looks a bit odd by White. The knights exert interesting pressure on the centre, but severely impede eveything else. ",
        "4... e6": "Continuing to develop.",
        "5. f4 c5": "I always like to move the c-pawn before the knight if I can. ",
        "6. dxc5 Bxc5": "Development looks good so far. Threatening the e3 pawn. ",
        "7. c4": "Overlooked by White.",
        "7... Bxe3 8. Qb3": "Forking the bishop and the b pawn. ",
        "8... Ng4": "8...Bb6 seemed a natural way to defend both threats, but the text move defends the bishop, and sets the scene. ",
        "9. Qxb7": "The free pawn was just too irresistable...",
        "9... Bf2+": "With the bishops effectively out of play, and the queen off on a pawn grabbing sortie there is no escape.",

        "10... Ne3#": "And a very attractive mate don't you think? Thanks for reading! All comments welcome. "
