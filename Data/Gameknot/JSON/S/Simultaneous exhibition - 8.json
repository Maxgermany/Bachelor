        "5... fxg3 6. O-O gxh2+ 7. Kh1": "White's King is exposed, but his Rook and Bishop bear down ominously on KB7.",
        "7... Nh6": "A mistake by the amateur. According to analysis by Philidor in *1749* (!), the best move is 7... B-B3. Philidor's analysis continued with 8 P-K5 P-Q4! 9 PxB NxP and Black is ahead in material with good chances to beat back the attack.",
        "8. d4 Qe7": "Black adds to his defenses of the weak KBP.",
        "9. Bxh6 gxh6 10. Ne5": "White must press the attack. Even if he wins 2 of Black's tripled KRP's, an endgame would be lost. Blacks passed KRP would be crushing.",
