        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O": "its kind of a gambit , morphy gives up a Pawn for getting development better and space advantage for he's pieces , this is very good variation which Kasparov use against many players and won, about  130 years later .",
        "5... Nxe4 6. Re1 d5 7. Bxd5": "Very intresting  , it seems that Morphy sucrifies a bishop now but the black knight is pinned by the rook on e1 , and after 7...Qxd5 will be 8.Nc3! and double attack on the queen on d5 and the knight on e4 , and its impossible to take the knight on c3 because of apin on d4 pawn for example : 8...dxc3??.9.Qxd5 and the game is lost for black . there for by the mo9ve 8.Nc3-Qh5 wich we  will see next , white takes back  matirial with positional advantage . ",
        "7... Qxd5 8. Nc3 Qh5 9. Nxe4 Be6": "the whites threat was Nf6+ and the black queen is trapped there for black wishes to close the wide open e file to avoid open check by the white rook on e1 and black develops he's LSB at the same time , any way , my opinion that maybe 9...Be7 was better move with the idea of 10..0-0 as soon as possible . and for the reason of avoiding Ng5 in the future. ",
        "10. Neg5 Bb4": "another interesting move , 10.Ndg5 !? pins the black LSB on e6 threats to take it on he's next move and win a pawn and by the way blacks d4 pawn is under attack . there for blacks plays 10...Bb4 with a tempo ( attacks the whit rook on e1 ) but Morphy finds a great way to advance hes advantage by another scarifies .",
        "11. Rxe6+": "butty , black must capture the rook on e6 , and after 11...fxe .12. Nxe6 and black cant castle , there is double threat now  i mean the white knight on e6 threats double fork on g7 and c7 and force the black queen to retreat to f7 and defend those threats . but after.12. Nfg5 attacking the queen on f7 , the expose black king  on the center , and white joins more pieces to the attack it seems that it is only matter of time until black recognize he's defeat .",
        "11... fxe6 12. Nxe6 Qf7 13. Nfg5 Qe7 14. Qe2": "a good move , 14.Qe2! another double attack and black all most hope less because of he's un abillity to castel and run away hes king from danger , another idea by the move 14.Qe2! is to keep more and more  pressure on the center .",
        "14... Bd6": "black defends c7 now but the wide open expose black king will pay a Price with another magnificent tactics by Morphy .",
        "15. Nxg7+ Kd7 16. Qg4+ Kd8 17. Nf7+": "why Morphy scarifies a knight ?!, the idea is to destruct the black queen from e7 and after 18.Bg5+Be7 (forced) , 19.Ne6+ ...., black under heavy mate attack .",
        "17... Qxf7 18. Bg5+ Be7 19. Ne6+ Kc8": "black in lost position , it was better for him to play 19...Ke8.20.Nxc7+Ke8.21.Nxa8,  but still  it is hard to believe that black survives this game but now after 19..Kc8??, Morphy ends this game with beautiful way with forced mate .",
        "20. Nc5+ Kb8 21. Nd7+ Kc8 22. Nb6+ Kb8 23. Qc8+": "magnificent ",
        "23... Rxc8 24. Nd7#": "thank you very much , hope you enjoyed my annotation , i would like to read your comments , Daniel (Matsany) ."
