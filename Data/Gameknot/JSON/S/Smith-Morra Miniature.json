        "11. Nh4 Qe8": "11.. Rh7 would seem to be better, though this is clearly a depressing game for Black either way.  The text covers one fork threat (at g6), but opens another. ",
        "12. Nb5": "Now what?  If 12.. Rb8, 13 Nc7 anyway and the Black queen can't watch g6.  If 12.. Bd8, 13 Nd6 is lethal.  Black resigns.  "
