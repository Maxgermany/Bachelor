    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5 2. Bc4": "I annotated this game largely for my own improvement to see what I didn't see before.  Therefore, throw ideas and criticisms my way, and I hope this game helps everyone as well.\r\n\r\nWhite immediately threatens f7.",
        "2... e6": "Black blunts the bishop's diagonal and prepares for an eventual d5.  One of the ideas of d5 is the black center expands with a gain of time, but it seems to me that the quality of this is questionable because white would like to reposition the bishop anyway.",
        "3. a3": "This could also prepare for an attempt to play b4?  If this is white attempting to prepare an escape for the bishop, I don't think much of the move: 3... d5 4.exd5 exd5 5. Ba2?  After all, 5.Bb5  can easily be met by 5... Bd7  Nor do I think much of an early Bc4 for that matter either because white has zero control over whether c4 will prove to be an effective spot for the bishop.  How much of an advantage is \"better developed\" if it's developed to the wrong square?",
        "3... g6 4. Nf3 Bg7": "Black seizes control of the a1-h8 diagonal.  This also, at least temporarily, pins b2.",
        "5. c3": "White prepares to challenge in the center and frees the b pawn to advance if White chooses.  If this were an English opening, this move by black would be \"Kere's move.\"  It can be particularly effective there, and there's a good chance it has some teeth here too.",
        "5... a6": "Black prepares Nc3 as to avoid Bb5.  Bb5 allows an exchange that worsens the black pawn structure.  One odd characteristic of Sicilian defenses (according to Alburt and Dzindzichasvili in Chess Openings for Black Explained) is that should the game progress to the endgame, the endgame will tend to favor black.  Therefore preserving the black pawn structure is probably worth the extra effort.",
        "6. d4 cxd4": "White expands his center.  A defense of the c5 pawn could could have been considered with b6, but the exchange takes a wing pawn for a center pawn.",
        "7. Nxd4": "White takes the pawn with his knight.  I believe that cxd4 (I'm a little unsure as to when the defense is a pure or semi-Tarrasch defense) leads to black being able to force white into an Isolated Queen Pawn situation (7... d5), but neither alternative is clearly superior.  Top players attempt to use the IQP as a weapon as much as a liability.  The drawback here is until black plays Ne7, d5 will force both sides to accept the IQP.  White simply had the option of restoring his central pawns and declined.",
        "7... Ne7 8. Be3": "I believe Nc6 is standard here, but black didn't want to contest the knight on d4 yet.  Ne7 allows Bg5.",
        "8... O-O 9. O-O Nbc6": "The position so far seems routine and roughly equal.",
        "10. f4 d5": "The move, f4, is very bold and under certain conditions good, but here I believe it premature.  The plan introduces a weakness into White's king safety, and black can counter in the center (which I do).\r\n\r\nOne factor favoring a white king-side attack is the bishop on e3. One factor discouraging it is White's center not being firm. I've played a few games where f4 as white (f5 as black) was played against me and I survived because it wasn't prepared properly. I've also played games where I played f4 or f5. To me (for some reason I don't fully comprehend) f4 seems a little more natural than f5, but f5 actually is a fair response to f4.",
        "11. exd5 Nxd5": "The options were the bishop retreat and the loss of a pawn or the exchange.  White chooses the exchange, and black decides to attempt to deny white the bishop pair.  If black were to take back with the e pawn, he transposes into a pure Tarrasch defense by accepting the isolated queen pawn.  Now for white to continue, there are a few interesting ideas offered by myself and others.  In the comments, dmaestro suggests the complex  [A]12. Nxc6 leading to either [A1]12... Nxe3 offering the queen trade plus either knight or rook trade of [A2]12... bxc6.  I think worthy of consideration is [B]12. Bxd5 as suggested by ionadowman.",
        "12. Rf3 Nxe3 13. Rxe3": "White accepts the idea, but this is bad for him.  The knight on d4 is very vulnerable.  If white is to accept the loss of the bishop pair, why not do it on his own terms as suggested by 12. Bxd5?",
        "13... Nxd4 14. Rd3": "White sees that 14. cxd4 Bxd4 pins and wins the rook for bishop.  Unfortunately, this is only slightly better.",
        "14... Qb6": "The player apastpawn annotates this same game, and he feels that Qc7 challenging white's light-square bishop was superior because if white saves the bishop, the tempo used allows the knight to escape.  Personally, it's a little hard to be too critical of an idea that cascaded into domination by black.",
        "15. cxd4": "Even without the g7 bishop, Rxd4 is unplayable because of the pin.  If it were playable, rook pawn versus bishop knight is actually equality.",
        "15... Rd8 16. g3": "This move is a mistake.  It solves none of the most pressing problems in white's position, nor does it give black any pressing problems of his own.  White's kingside initiative has failed before it even really started.  \r\n\r\nThe b2 pawn is a real problem that needs addressing.  White should consider Ra2.  Black can capitalize on 16. b4 because of 16. ... Rxd4.",
        "16... Rxd4 17. Qb3": "Ouch.  White believes he can prevent exchanging rook for bishop by offering rook for rook.",
        "17... Rxd3+": "Black secures rook for bishop as we'll see.  It only appeared like Qxb3 embarasses the overworked bishop.",
        "18. Qxb6 Bd4+": "As planned.",
        "19. Kf1": "White attempts to secure an even trade, but instead only gives his rook away for free.  Kg2 appears to accomplish what Kf1 could not.",
        "19... Rf3+ 20. Kg2 Rf2+ 21. Kh1 Bxb6": "White is now a rook and a pawn down.  He is simply too far gone.  White should have moved away from the corner with his king.",
        "22. Nc3": "This is fine, but b4 was worth considering.",
        "22... Ba7": "Black is intending b5 followed by Bb7 .",
        "23. b4 e5": "Probably a mistake albeit a small one given such a strong advantage.  Black abandons the idea of Bb7 in favor of Bg3.  If I had played b5, white could not afford to lose more material and the upcoming rook harassment would have been met forcefully.  ionadowman says, \"Hard to see the reason for the change of mind. The original plan looks good to me.\"  He's right of course.  In the heat of battle we sometimes see phantom problems, and this was the case here: I was worried about the bishop's retreat to f1 as in 23... b5 24. Bf1 Bc7  25. Bg2, but this is still quite good. e.g. 25... Bxg2  26. Kg2 Rc2#  Probably even quicker was Bd7, Bc6 .",
        "24. Ne4 Rc2 25. Bb3 Re2": "White harrases the black rook, but its placement on the 2nd rank is too desirable for black to simply retreat.",
        "26. Nf6+": "Grasping at straws.  Ng5 at least allows a small recoup of material, but it neglects the black threat too.",
        "26... Kg7 27. Ne8+ Kh6": "As tempting as it is to swat the fly, it's a waste of energy.",
        "28. Nf6 Bh3": "\"I'm your Huckleberry.\"  Ironically had white's Light-square bishop not moved, it would have proved and excellent defender on f1 realizing the phantom problem I was trying to avoid here.",
        "29. Bd5 Rd8": "Black is now willing to trade down to remove the defender of g2.",
        "30. Bxb7": "Better was Bf3.",
        "30... Rdd2": "Black resigns.  Ng4  (defending h2) can be met with Bxb4."
