        "5. Bd2": "This is an interesting move for white. I like it",
        "5... Bg4": "This can serve 2 purposes. 1) Looking to transpose into something like the main line, or 2) tempting white to weaken the area around the king",
        "6. Be2 Bxe2 7. Qxe2 Nc6 8. Nf3 e6": "There is also 8.. O-O-O",
        "9. O-O Qh5": "There are several moves here including 9.. Bd6 and 9.. Qf5",
        "10. h3": "I liked this move very much, although 10. Ne4 is more common. Black needs to watch closely his move order now. Here is a game using 10. Ne4. The game was played in 1908 !!\n\n[White \"Perlis, Julius\"]\n[Black \"Mieses, Jacques\"]\n[Result \"1-0\"]\n1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Bd2 Bg4 6. Be2 Bxe2 7. Qxe2 Nc6\n8.

        "13... g5": "Now black is not concerned the f3 knight will move away allowing the queens to be exchanged",
        "14. b4": "Correct idea, but black's attack is more advanced",
        "14... g4": "This is a good position to study for attacking practice. Black has many pieces that he can point at white's king, but he must have a clear plan. ",
        "15. hxg4 Qxg4 16. Ne2": "Black will double on the open file, so white must prevent mate on g2",
        "16... Rdg8": "Important to move the d-file rook. The other rook will be needed on h8 to support the h pawn, as black drives the white knight away",
