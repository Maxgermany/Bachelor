        "1. e4 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 d6 5. d4 cxd4 6. Nxd4 e5 7. Nxc6 bxc6": "I don't quite know what to call this opening - an English that aspires to be a Sicilian? A Sicilian that wants to be an English when it grows up? It looks most like a Maroczy Bind, but White needs a pawn at f3 to make that official.",
        "8. Bg5": "Oh! - now adding the flavor of a Richter-Rauzer to the stew. Let's just say the opening has taken a very independent turn.",
        "8... Be7 9. Bxf6 gxf6": "Black's pawn structure looks hideous, but decades of practical games at every level have demonstrated positions like this are actually quite playable provided Black carries out certain strategic operations, like the advance of his h-pawn. More shockingly still, it's common for Black to leave his King anchored in the center where, oddly enough, it's safest from attack.",
        "10. Bd3": "Anti-positional. Better was 10. Be2 with more normal development.",
        "10... h5 11. Qd2 h4": "This is the correct square for the pawn.",
        "12. h3 Rg8": "If 13. Qh6 Rg2  14. Qh4 Qb6  15. Qh8 Kd7 and Black is on top. If 14. Qh8 Kd7  15. Qh4 Qb6 transposes. And finally if 14. Qh8 Kd7  15. Qd8 Bd8 (with the idea of Ke7-Bb6), Black is okay.",
        "13. f3 Rh8 14. O-O-O Qc7": "14. ...a5 was probably more accurate.",
        "15. Kb1 Bd7": "Keeping the b-file open.",
        "16. f4 a5 17. fxe5 fxe5 18. Rhg1 a4 19. a3 Qb6 20. g4 Rb8": "If 20. ...hg3 Black simply opens lines for White to exploit. ",
        "21. Nxa4 Qb3 22. Nc3 Qxa3 23. c5": "Desperation? There's really no need to White to give this pawn away, although it's hard to suggest anything better than trying to free that overgrown pawn at d3.",
        "23... Qxc5 24. Na4 Qa7 25. Nc3 Be6 26. Rg2 Ra8": "Black now threatens ...Bb3, winning.",
        "27. Nd5": "No mistaking it now - that's desperation.",
        "27... Qa1+ 28. Kc2 Qa4+ 29. Kb1 cxd5 30. Qe2 Bd7 31. exd5 Qa2+ 32. Kc1 Bg5+": "Setting up a back-rank mate.",
        "33. Rd2 Rc8+": "Now if 34. Bc2 Qa1 is mate, and if 34. Kd1 Qa1  35. Bb1 Qb1 is mate. So White plays the \"other choice.\"",
        "34. Bc4 Rxc4+": "Obviously not 34. Qc4, giving White the chance to continue limping through the endgame. So, White resigns."
