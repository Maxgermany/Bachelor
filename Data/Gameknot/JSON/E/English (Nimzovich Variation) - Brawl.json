        "1. c4 e5 2. Nf3": "The Nimzovich Variation, my \"secret weapon\" with which I've upended several Gameknot-rated Experts. Combined with a Kingside finachetto, the variation can give rise to dynamic positions bristling with tactical possibilities and chances for White on both wings. In this game Black tries to blow the variation out of the water right out of the gate (and comes close to succeeding), but at the cost of forsaking his King in the middle of the board while the center pawns evaporateand White's heavy pieces loom on the e- and f-files.",
        "2... Nc6 3. d3 Bc5 4. g3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Ng4 6. e3 f5": "Sharp play! Black goes straight for the jugular. The quieter continuation is 6. .....d6.",
        "7. Bg2 f4 8. Nxe5": "Touching off a good, old-fashioned tactical melee.",
        "8... Ncxe5 9. d4 fxe3 10. fxe3": "Another possibility, and probably safer, was 10. 0-0!? ef2  11. Kh1 since the g4N cannot hold its post.",
        "10... Qf6": "Blunt.",
        "11. Rf1 Qg6 12. Be4": "White must play actively to prevent Black's attack from building to a truly dangerous level.",
        "12... Qh6 13. dxc5 Qxh2 14. Qd5 Qxg3+ 15. Kd1 d6": "For the moment the attacks of both players have been stymied, so Black tries to make breathing space for his King on the Queenside.",
        "16. cxd6 c6 17. Qd2": "17. Qd4 keeps the Queen centralized, and so is objectively the stronger choice.",
        "17... Nxc4 18. Qe2": "I had wanted to play 18. Qg2 until I noticed the family fork on e3 ....yuck! The text is not a bad move, however, because the the xray through to Black's King, a finesse Black now obligingly walks into.",
        "18... Ngxe3+ 19. Bxe3 Nxe3+ 20. Kd2 Nxf1+ 21. Rxf1": "And suddenly the exposed position of Black's King is becoming terminal.",
        "21... Qg5+ 22. Kc2": "Black has thwarted the immediate mate threats but unfortunately time expired before he decided how best to answer the threat of 23. d7+ Bd7  24. Bc6+."
