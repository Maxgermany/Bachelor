        "1. c4 e5 2. Nf3": "The Nimzovich variation, which can quickly transpose into normal lines or lead to independent play.",
        "2... e4": "Black accepts the challenge.",
        "3. Nd4 Nf6 4. Nc3 c5 5. Nc2 d6 6. g3 Be7 7. Bg2 e3": "I was expecting 7. ...Bf5. The biggest problem with this move isn't that it just drops a pawn for no visible compensation, it's that it cedes the h1-a8 diagonal without a fight.",
        "8. dxe3 Nbd7 9. O-O O-O 10. a3 Ne5 11. b3 Rb8 12. f4": "Of course. With the White's QB still on the board the sortie by the Black N to g4, threatening e3, carries no sting.",
        "12... Neg4 13. h3 Nh6 14. e4": "White already has a huge advantage in space. Now, to begin capitalizing on that ....",
        "14... Qe8 15. Be3 Nd7": "Black is tripping all over himself because his pieces have no useful squares to post to.",
        "16. Bf2": "The other decent choice here was 16. Nd5, although I wanted to be able to keep a Knight there once played. That would have been impossible after 16. ...Nb6. The text move opens e3 for the N at c2; it incidentally also buttresses g3, one of White's few sensitive squares in the position.",
        "16... f5 17. Rb1 Nf6 18. e5 dxe5 19. fxe5 Nd7 20. Qd5+ Kh8": "Now that White has thrust his Queen into the thick of things, some care must be taken not to allow Black to clamber back into the game by attacking her with developing tempi.",
        "21. b4 Nb6 22. Qd3 Be6 23. Nd5 Rd8 24. bxc5": "Now if 24. ...Nd5  25. cd5 conjures up a dangerous passed pawn phalanx right in the heart of Black's position.",
        "24... Na4 25. Rxb7 Bxc5": "Black's eyes get big at the prospect of 26. Bc5?? Nc5 winning the Rook. In stead White improves his position while aborting the threat.",
        "26. Nd4 Rf7 27. Rfb1 Bxd4 28. Bxd4 f4 29. Rb1b4 Bf5 30. Qb3 Nb6 31. Rxf7 Qxf7 32. gxf4 Bxh3": "Black hopes to whip up a K-side attack behind this sac.",
        "33. Bxh3 Qg6+ 34. Kf2 Ng4+ 35. Bxg4 Qxg4 36. Qg3": "Swatting the nuisance at g4 is not the only purpose of this move.",
        "36... Qd7 37. e6": "With the text White's threats become numerous: mate is threatened at g7, compelling 37. ...Qb7 under a pin, after which White has a grab-bag of winning ways to proceed, beginning with renewing the mate threat by playing 38. e7. So, Black resigns."
