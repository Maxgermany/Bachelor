        "1. d4": "Good morning all. This game is currently unfinished. but the board finds itself in a fun position being a bit of material down. but having good queen side pressure i believe. \n\nall comments are appreciated.\n",
        "1... Nf6": "my opponent is a d4 starter. and I've been practicing the Budapest counter for d4, here begins my 6th game with this start,",
        "2. c4": "natural reply",
        "2... e5": "e5 temporary pawn gambit",
        "3. dxe5": "accepts",
        "3... Ng4": "most common reply to take back the pawn",
        "4. e3": "gives back the material immediately. some people can choose to develop their Gknight or DSB to protect their pawn advantage",
        "4... Nxe5": "and so i take back. in another game here i tried more development before recapturing like nc6. it lead to a tangled fight and took a while to get back the material and that game isnt over heading into 40ish moves i believe.\n\ni also tried leaving the opponent the pawn edge playing d6 in another game to induce fxd6 to reply Bxf6 but that also lead to a tangled game,\n\nand so this third game is why i go with the immediate retake,",
        "5. a3": "hinders the DSBs check development and possible double pawn tactic on the c file",
        "5... Be7": "i decide to clear the way for an early castle.",
        "6. b4": "further pushes pawns down",
        "6... c5": "offer a pawn exchange and the c file would become a nice file for my DSB was my thought behind this move. i was also going to push queen side. i didnt think he would push by putting 2 pawns in front of his LSB's diagonal. but i may be wrong",
        "7. Bb2": "i didnt like this pressure, i also didnt want to play f7,  maybe d6 was a good move. or developing my B knight,\n\nbut i felt like exploring a new line see if i can come out on top with a knight sacrifice.  \n\nso i devised my plan from here. ill be able to take out his C B and A pawns at the cost of my knight and c pawns. and my objective will be to simplify out the remaining LSB connect my rooks behind my B and A pawns and have a pressure fight with 2 passed pawns.\n\nlets see if things go according to plan",
        "7... Nxc4": "and so i allow the LSB development",
        "8. Bxc4 cxb4": "keep eating the pawns.  i was hoping he would recapture here with the A pawn and i could take with my DSB and thought he would offer DSB exchanges to block the check",
        "9. Qb3": "hmm unanticipated. puts alot of presure on the king.  but looking at the scenario i feel i can defend it at the cost of a pawn if he decides to launch his attack. but i have to look to castle ASAP now, im happy the way is clear.",
        "9... bxa3": "so after feeling comfortable being able to defend atleast 1 turn before castling and i complete the plan to take all the queen side pawns off the board",
        "10. Bxa3": "anticipated reply. now i liked this position would make it easier to simplify out the bishops and head to the position i had planned before my knight sacrifice.",
        "10... O-O": "protect my king",
        "11. Bxe7": "anticipated reply.",
        "11... Qxe7": "development heading towards the connection of the rooks.",
        "12. Nf3": "anticipated reply. im also thinking his castle is coming next",
        "12... d6": "allow LSB development and head towards a strong middle to also protect the passed pawns",
        "13. O-O": "anticipated",
        "13... Be6": "simplification",
        "14. Bxe6 fxe6": "here i hesitated to offer queen exchanges and head into 2 rooks 1 knight  ith 2 passed pawns vs 2 rooks 2 knights.\n\nbut i felt like connecting 2 pawns in the middle was safer with queen behind them.",
        "15. Nbd2": "i didnt know which square he would choose with his knight. i had planned to play d5 eventually so this knight movement delights me temporarily",
        "15... Nc6": "last minor piece to develop",
        "16. Nc4": "hmm brings in his knight closer. i decide i dont have to move my pawns yet",
        "16... Rfb8": "and so my board is set to what i had planned before the knight sacrifice.\n\nand the game is currently at this move.\n\nmy questions are. was my knight sacrifice stupid? is this position playable? does it look fun? and which would you like to be in this position. white or black.\n\nall comments appreciated",
        "17. Qd3 d5 18. Ncd2 a5 19. Nb3 b6 20. Nbd4 Nb4 21. Qd2 b5 22. Ne5 Qd6 23. Nd3 Nxd3 24. Qxd3 b4 25. Rfc1 a4 26. Rc6 Qd7 27. Rc2 e5 28. Qf5 Qxf5 29. Nxf5 b3": "the board currently finds itself in this state... updated for completion purposes the early part was more important to analyse especially since it was potentially very blunderous to sacrifice the knight.... hmmmm opponent decides to resign. i dont know if it was premature i wouldve loved to play it out."
