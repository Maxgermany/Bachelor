        "1. e4": "In reviewing this game, using Gameknot's database, I learned what most people probably already know, that e4/e5/Nf3/Nc6 is the most popular opening, at least in Gameknot's world.  There would be a lot of trades in this game, and this game would come down to pawn structure and timing in the endgame.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3": "At this point, this game would typically go in one of four directions:\nC46: Three knights game\nC47: Four knights, Scotch variation\nC48: Four knights, Spanish variation\nC49: Four knights, double Ruy Lopez",
        "3... Bc5": "According to the GK database, Nf6 (Four Knights Game) is stronger, but black chooses Bc5, which starts the Three Knights Game.",
        "4. Bb5 d6 5. Bxc6+": "I was feeling aggressive that day.  I don't like to trade a bishop for a knight early, but I often will if it results in stacked pawns.",
        "5... bxc6 6. d4 exd4 7. Nxd4 Qh4": "An aggressive move, pressuring the f pawn, but relatively easy to defend.  But first, I have to bail out my knight at d4.",
        "8. Be3 Nf6 9. g3": "9. ... Qh3\n10. Qd3 Qg2\n11. O-O-O Bg4\n12. Rh-g1 Qf3\n13. Nxc6",
        "9... Qh3": "His queen is getting pesky.",
        "10. Qd3 Qg2": "Black tries to attack with one piece, always a difficult endeavor.",
        "11. O-O-O Ng4": "Ah, the second part of his attack.  Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.",
        "12. Qf1 Nxe3": "At this point, I could take his knight, fxe3 and provide additional protection on the knight at d4, but I must have (I can't recall specifically now after the fact) seen the potential for a trapped knight and must have been really worried about the possibility of the queen causing havoc, so I trade queens.",
        "13. Qxg2": "13. ... Nxg2\n14. Nxc6 Bxf2\n15. Rd2\n",
        "13... Nxg2 14. Nxc6": "Black goes up three points, but his knight is trapped, so I attack and bring the difference to two points.",
        "14... Bd7 15. Nd4": "I expected him to bail out his stranded knight, but he castles instead.\n15. ... Bh3\n16. Nc-e2 O-O\n17. Ng1\n",
        "15... O-O 16. h3": "Here, I'm trying to prevent black from protecting his knight with the bishop.",
        "16... f5 17. Rhg1 Nh4 18. gxh4 fxe4 19. Nxe4": "Finally back to a one point advantage, though my pawn structure isn't terribly good.",
        "19... Bxd4": "Never trade pieces when you're behind, right?",
        "20. Rxd4 Bxh3": "Except that he does capture one of my out-of-place pawns in the exchange.",
        "21. Ng5 Bf5 22. f4 h6 23. Nf3 Rfe8 24. c3 Re2 25. Rd2 Rae8 26. Nd4 Re2e1+ 27. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 28. Rd1 Rxd1+ 29. Kxd1": "All even again.  This becomes a pawn structure endgame.",
        "29... Be4 30. b4 Kf7 31. Kd2 Kf6 32. Ke3": "I was expecting him to advance his pawns while protecting the bishop, but he elects to attack.\n32. ... d5\n33. c4 c6\n34. Nxc6 Ke6\n35. Nxa7\n",
        "32... Bb1 33. a4": "He wasted time on that attack.",
        "33... c5 34. bxc5": "I'm expecting ...\n34. ... dxc5\n35. Nc6 a6\n36. a5\n",
        "34... dxc5 35. Nc6": "I get a bit luck with my knight.  I expected 35. .. a6, but he responds with Kf5.  This is probably the critical mistake in the game for black.",
        "35... Kf5 36. Nxa7": "36. ... Kg4\n37. a5 Kxh4\n38. a6\n",
        "36... Kg4 37. a5": "Here were my thoughts at this point:\n37. ... Kxh4\n38. a6 Ba2\n39. Ke4 Bb1 \n40. Ke5 g5\n41. Nc6 gxf4\n42. Kxf4 h5\n43. a7\n",

        "38... Kg4 39. Nc6 h5 40. a7 h4 41. a8=Q": "The beginning of the end.",
        "41... h3 42. Ne5+": "I plotted out the possible scenarios.\n42. ... Kg3 43. Qf3  Kh4 44. Qf2  Kh5 45. Qg3\n42. ... Kh4 43. Qh8  Kg3 44. Qxg7  Kh4 45. Qg5 \n42. ... Kh5 43. Qh8  Bh7 44. Qxh7 \n42. ... Kf5 43. Qc8  Kf6 44. Qxh3\n",
