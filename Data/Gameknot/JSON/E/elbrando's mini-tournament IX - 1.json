        "2. Nf3 Qf6": "Hmm, I'm not sure I like this. It develops the queen too early and takes away the knights best square.",
        "3. Bc4 Bc5": "Hoping I'll move my knight?",
        "4. d3 d6 5. Bg5": "Okay, I don't like this move. It forces the queen to move and vacate the knight's favorite square. ",
        "5... Qg6 6. Nc3 c6": "It takes away the knights best square, but it prepares d5 so maybe it's okay",
        "7. O-O Bg4": "Pins my knight. Looks serious at first sight because it removes defense of my DSB, but if he takes it and I take it back, and he takes my queen we are equal after I take his bishop with a rook.",
        "8. Bh4": "? I don't see why I moved it. Maybe I was worried about the pin.",
        "8... Bh3": "Threatening mate.",
        "9. Bg3 Bg4 10. b3 h5": "The start of a pawn storm maybe?",

        "15... Nxe5 16. Qxe5+ Be6": "Ouch, this move allows a discovered attack that will win black's DSB",
        "17. Bxe6 fxe6 18. Qxc5": "So I grab the bishop",
        "18... h4": "Makes me move my bishop but doesn't seem to do much",
        "19. Bc7 Rc8": "An annoying little pin",
        "20. Nb5 b6 21. Qd6 a6": "Doesn't seem to accomplish much, my knight wasn't really doing anything there.",
        "22. Na7": "So I attack the rook",
        "22... Ra8 23. Bxb6": "Takes a pawn and defends the knight at the same time.",
        "23... Nf6": "Finally finished developing minor pieces",
        "24. Bc5": "Threatens mate",
        "24... Ng4": "Even if it weren't for the mate threat this isn't really a good move.",
        "25. Qe7#": "...And mate! As always, please comment."
