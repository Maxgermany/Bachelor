        "1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 Nc6": "I consider this almost a mistake by black, because it blocks the c pawn, the black's mobile part of the game. ",
        "4. e3 Nf6 5. h3": "To provide an escape way for my beloved dsb in h2. It's kind a waste of time. The alternative was to avoid this escape taking the Nf3 to e5. This leads to NxN, dxN, and another game. I wanted to play for this one. ",
        "5... Be7": "The Nc6 is a real can tap for black. Bd6 is another way to see the situation. I would have answered Ne5. ",
        "6. Nbd2": "I don't plan c4, this is to block the black's dsb with c3. ",
        "6... O-O 7. g4": "This is my plan: to attack the kingside. ",
        "7... h6 8. Ne5": "Thematic. I give black the chance to get rid off his black knight, but I open the way for the queen to h5. ",
        "8... Bd6": "Too late. ",
        "9. h4": "Now g4 is protected, and I can press the kingside. This move also avoids the symmetric queen's invasion in h4, once the Nf6 has flew.",
        "9... Bxe5 10. dxe5": "Now, black can play d4 the next one, his best chance to expand. But I have a tempo (if black decides not to sac the knight for the attack).",
        "10... Ne4 11. Bd3": "This also prevents d4. Now, black should go NxN, and after QxN, d4 is playable (so I should have played something else!). But without the knight, I feel my position would be defendable. ",
        "11... f5": "Trying to block the kingside with this well-known structure. If I take ep, exf6, his pieces suddenly get to life, and I think it was more precise...",
        "12. g5": "...because black cannot h5 or Qxh5. I don't exchange the knight because it would make me lose a precious tempo retiring the bishop from there. ",
        "12... hxg5": "Thank you black...",
        "13. hxg5": "...being the h column my real target. ",
        "13... Nxg5 14. Qh5": "Now the piece is lost, or it has to go back. ",
        "14... Ne4": "It goes back, sensibly. But what a tempo loss!",
        "15. Be2": "Instead of going like a boy after the check, I thought that it would have been more accurate to get the bishop into the fry, overlooking Qh7+, Kf7, Rg1, Rg8, Qg6+, Ke7, NxN and then is up to black to find an answer for Bg5+, taking the queen. ",
        "15... Nb4": "Well, black is dreaming about attacks (or free himself a little), and this just gives me a move to...",
        "16. O-O-O": "And what about Nxf2, forking the two rooks? Don't worry: the attack I have is more than enough. ",
        "16... Nxf2 17. Qh7+": "Here it goes!",
        "17... Kf7 18. Bh5+": "Handy, isn't it?",
        "18... Ke7 19. Bg5+": "Which is better? Ok, I'm two pawns down but... who cares? But this was just an oversight: Qxg7+ and mate on the next. I miserabily failed to see it. ",
        "19... Kd7": "Now it's too late: the king escapes and it will become a little nightmare to catch it. ",
        "20. Qxg7+ Kc6 21. Bxd8": "A queen is a queen. No brilliant mate on sight, sigh!",
        "21... Rxd8 22. Rh4": "A way to mobilize my pieces. A rook on the queenside and I \"must\" get this king...",
        "22... Nxd1 23. Rxb4 Nxe3": "Aha... and the mate isn't any near! This is becoming annoyant. And after all, I am only +2. The fact that black pieces are cashed in gives me the edge, but... I see free pawns coming in. ",
        "24. c4": "I'll give him another, but I have to try to open the cage the king is in. ",
        "24... a5": "Very good by black. I just don't want to retire my rook, no with my advantage. ",
        "25. cxd5+": "The position is opened. ",
        "25... exd5 26. Qf6+ Kc5": "Ok, I can't see the mate. Can you?",
        "27. Qe7+": "Kind of nice. ",
        "27... Kc6 28. Be8+": "I can always retire the rook. I just want to avoid it, be smarter. I'm not sure it was the right idea, because if Rb3, black can't play d4 because of Bf3+, Nd5, Rc3+, Kb5, Qc5+, and mate on the next. ",
        "28... Bd7": "Well... ",
        "29. Qe6+": "Just playing with the mouse?",
        "29... Kc5": "Nothing better that I found. Probably Rxb7 would have helped, but I wasn't so sure. ",
        "30. Qe7+": "Let's try another way. ",
        "30... Kc6 31. Bxd7+": "Ok, let's see what happens. ",
        "31... Rxd7 32. Qe6+": "Black can even think about some Re6, exR, axR, but for QxN. ",
        "32... Kc5": "Now I do have to retire my rook, or exchange it with him. The exchange was good, but I play for fun.",
        "33. Rb3": "What happens now? Black still have to protect two pieces, and sure he will prefer the rook. ",
        "33... Rad8": "Exactly. ",
        "34. Rxe3": "Now my advantage is so strong that I can play without... well... let's see...",
        "34... d4": "Nb3+, Kb5. Can you see the mate? I can't. ",
        "35. Qc4+": "Here it must be!",
        "35... Kb6 36. Rb3+ Ka7": "Still no mate. Qc5+, b6 and... Nc4, and... ",
        "37. Qb5": "Maybe this way. ",
        "37... b6 38. Nc4": "Aha, now the knight sac would be the definitive element to win. ",
        "38... Rd7d5 39. Qc6 Rc5": "Can you believe that? This happens to me for playing lightly. ",
        "40. Qe6": "I was in a really delicate situation, all of a sudden, wiht all my advantage. ",
        "40... b5": "Interesting. No, I cannot accept that, there must be a way...",
        "41. Kd2": "Qe7, RxN+, and then saves the other rook. Holdable, but... wasn't I safer with this one? ",
        "41... bxc4 42. Ra3": "Well... not at all. ",
        "42... c3+": "Black is playing well, and I am shaking. ",
        "43. bxc3 dxc3+ 44. Kc2": "I expected Rd2+, Kb3, c2... and I could have resigned (or accept the game with a new black queen on the board, trying to give it for a rook...). My queen is in a horrible position. ",
        "44... Rdd5": "Black make here his worst mistake, assuming the previous line was correct. Still, it is not easy to find a way to the win. I can Qxf5, Rxe5, etc...",
        "45. Rxc3": "Uff, I must take the pawn undoubtely. But not with his rook on a column farther from my king than the d. Now, he can easily go Rxe5, and then my queen must run and Re2+, and I have Kd3 and I am saved. If 46. Qxf5 instead, Rxe5, Qf2! pinning the other rook! ",
        "45... Rdxe5 46. Qd7": "No place to go to cover Re2+. I will have to lose another pawn (a2)",
        "46... Red5 47. Qf7": "It's up to you, black. ",
        "47... Rxc3+ 48. Kxc3": "Ok, this is good for me, of course. But the situation is not as clear as before. ",
        "48... Rc5+ 49. Kb3 Kb6 50. Qe6+": "I will have to work a lot to get it. I couldn't imagine this was a decisive move.",
        "50... c6": "Blacke thinks to close in a fortress and resist as he can, but overlooked a wonderful and unsuspected situation on the next move.",
        "51. Qe3": "Black is in an almost-zugwang position. ",
        "51... Kb5 52. a4+": "If a3, a4+. ",
        "52... Kb6 53. Ka3": "A waiting move, because now the black king cannot return to b5. ",
        "53... f4": "The only escape for black. ",
        "54. Qxf4 Rc3+ 55. Kb2 Rc4": "Black had a blackout here, and so did I. I couldn't believe this rook was unprotected, and, with few seconds left, played the \"more interesting\" move. ",
        "56. Qb8+ Kc5 57. Qa7+": "...grabbing another pawn, and with it all black's hopes. ",
        "57... Kb4": "Black doesn't want, but...",
        "58. Qb6+ Kxa4 59. Qb3#": "Forced. Thank you for reading. "
