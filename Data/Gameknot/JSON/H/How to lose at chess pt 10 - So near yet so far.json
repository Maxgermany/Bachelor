I rarely get a material advantage against such a high ranked player without a lot of pain following soon after but I couldn't see here what that might be",

        "20... a5": "This is something I never usually see, a move that the computer calls a blunder from a high ranked player due to \u2026 a5 21. Qe6+ Kf8 22. Qxd6+ Kg8 23. O-O Qe3+ 24. Kh2 Qxd3 25. Qxc6 Kh7 26. c5 Rhb8 27. bxa5 Rxa5 28. Qc7 Rab5 29. Rxf6 Rxc5",
