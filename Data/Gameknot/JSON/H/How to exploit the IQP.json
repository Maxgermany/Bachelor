        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5": "The Queen's Gambit.",
        "4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 O-O 6. e3": "Karpov completes his queenside development with a slight advantage.",
        "6... c5": "Spassky plays a central pawn break in hopes of taking advantage of Karpov's uncastled king.",
        "7. dxc5 Nc6": "Hoping to win back the pawn later.",
        "8. Qc2 Qa5": "It looks like Black is getting active. He has the threat of ...Ne4 and inflicting tripled pawns.",
        "9. a3": "But this is only an illusion. Because of this pawn move, 9...Ne4?? is no good, because of 10. b4 and white wins 2 pawns.",
        "9... Bxc5 10. Rd1": "Karpov activates his rook and simultaneously threatens the fork b2-b4.",
        "10... Be7 11. Nd2": "Karpov prevents ...Ne4 and is ready to complete development.",
        "11... Bd7 12. Be2 Rfc8 13. O-O": "Karpov gets his king out of the center and completes development and is now ready to take advantage of better mobilization. I think Spassky probably should have played ...Rd8 and ...d4 to try to get play against the white king, or 11...e5, to attack the bishop.",
        "13... Qd8": "I don't know, why did Spassky retreat his queen?",
        "14. cxd5": "Karpov takes advantage of the black queen's departure to forcefully give Black the isolated queen pawn. Because his pieces are somewhat passive, the IQP turns out to be a liability rather than an asset.",
        "14... exd5": "This is better than 14...Nxd5 because after 15. Nxd5 exd5, a pair of knights has been traded. The side with the IQP should avoid trading minor pieces; the side playing against the IQP should seek trades of minor pieces.",
        "15. Nf3": "Karpov prevents ...d4 which would trade off the IQP and equalize the pawn structure.",
        "15... h6": "This only helps White continue with his plan. Ng5 and Bg5 were not dangerous.",
        "16. Ne5": "Karpov begins trading minor pieces and improves his knight in the process. Note that 16. Nxd5?? would be a blunder, due to 16...Nd4 17. Nxe7+ Qxe7 18. Qd3 (Qe2 Rc2) Bb5 19. Qxd4 Bxe2.",
        "16... Be6": "Black protects d5, which was hanging.",
        "17. Nxc6 Rxc6": "The other recapture, 17...bxc6, would result in \"hanging pawns\": the black pawns on the b- and c-files have no support from other pawns.",
        "18. Bf3": "Karpov pins the d5-pawn to the rook and starts to load up on the weak pawn.",
        "18... Qb6": "Spassky activates his queen and attacks b2.",
        "19. Be5": "Threatening Bxf6 and Bxd5.",
        "19... Ne4": "Spassky places his knight on the e4 outpost and attacks the pinned knight. Is he starting to get counterplay?",
        "20. Qe2 Nxc3 21. Bxc3": "He is not. The maneuver, Bf3-e5-c3, gives White a clear positional advantage.",
        "21... Rd8": "A forced defense.",
        "22. Rd3": "Karpov prepares to load his heavy pieces on the weak pawn.",
        "22... Rcd6 23. Rfd1 Rd6d7 24. Rd1d2 Qb5 25. Qd1": "The Alekhine's gun on the d-file has Black tied down to its defense, but Karpov will need to open a new front to win the game. The usual way to win a pawn, e3-e4, does not work at the moment because d7 is protected 4 times. But the passivity of Black's pieces will ensure that Karpov will have the advantage when he finds a new plan.",
        "25... b6 26. g3": "Do not hurry when your opponent is tied down.",
        "26... Bf8 27. Bg2 Be7 28. Qh5": "White's queen reaches an active square, and e4 is threatened.",
        "28... a6 29. h3 Qc6 30. Kh2": "These 'quiet' moves are a key part of Karpov's play.",
        "30... a5 31. f4": "With the threat of f5 winning the bishop.",
        "31... f6 32. Qd1 Qb5 33. g4": "Karpov will force the e6-bishop away from guarding the d7-rook. Note that because Black's pieces are in a bind, there are no problems with pushing the pawns in front of the king.",
        "33... g5 34. Kh1 Qc6 35. f5": "Now the bishop will not control d7.",
        "35... Bf7 36. e4 Kg7 37. exd5 Qc7": "Now Karpov prepares the end of the game.",
        "38. Re2 b5 39. Rxe7": "The winning tactic.",
        "39... Rxe7 40. d6": "Forking the queen and rook.",
        "40... Qc4": "The d pawn is pinned, but there is a move that forces resignation.",
        "41. b3": "The black queen is deflected from d3. If 41...Qxb3??, then 42. Bxf6+, so black resigns."
