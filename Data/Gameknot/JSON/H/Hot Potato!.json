        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\n\nThe Sicilian is not an opening for the faint hearted.  Defense and passivitis will get you nowhere in the middlegame!  Well, I can tell you that neither player showed much passivitis in the middlegame.  However, unfortunately for my opponent, small-potato, a bigger concentration of white pieces in his position at the right time ensured that it was not Henry that was to topple.  In this game, much to black's chagrin, Glenda snapped out of her defensive role and became one hot potato!  So, how did all this happen?  Well, let's kick off with 1. e4 c4.  This is the Sicilian Defense and the word defense is a misnomer because both sides may end up being at each other's throats.",
        "1... c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4": "3. d4 - some very standard moves here.",
        "3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3": "6. Nc3 - standard development.",
        "5... a6": "6. .... a6 - this is a move I am becoming all too familiar with.  This move characterises the Naijdorf which prepares b5.  Now if the two sides castle on the opposite side (white normally queenside), then I am aware of the fact that Henry can be subject to an almighty barrage down the a-c columns by major pieces and they can all line up neatly behind the pushed pawns.  So somehow, I must counter-attack vigorously on the kingside and get my punch in first.",
        "6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3": "8. f3 - preparing g4 if black castles short.",
        "8... Be7 9. Qd2 Nbd7 10. g4": "10. g4 - I do it anyway and black castles short immediately afterwards and I castle long.  Game on!",
        "10... O-O 11. O-O-O b5 12. g5 b4": "12. ..... b4 - the race and the heat is on!",
        "13. Ne2 Ne8 14. f4 a5 15. f5 a4": "15. ..... a4 - aha, a white knight on the queenside is en prise to a pawn and a black light square bishop is also en prise to a pawn.  I wonder if black will play B x N here.",
        "16. fxe6 axb3 17. exf7+ Rxf7": "17. ..... Rxf7 - thanks to the berserker effect of my f pawn which perished on f7 material is still even.  I am eyeing up that black rook on f7 and I sincerely hope he leaves it there.  I have plans for Fou Leblanc!",
        "18. Kb1 bxa2+ 19. Ka1": "19. Ka1 - Henry shelters behind an enemy pawn ensuring that for now, the heavy black artilliary will be biting on granite.",
        "19... Qa5 20. Bh3": "20. Bh3 - this seemingly innocuous bishop move is gonna net a material gain for me.  Now which black piece is en prise?",
        "20... Nc5 21. Bxc5 dxc5": "21. ..... dxc5 - I trade off Fou Lenoir for a reason.  Removal of the Guard!",
        "22. Be6": "22. Be6 - exchange winning mission accomplished!",
        "22... Nd6 23. Bxf7+ Kxf7 24. Qd5+": "24. Qd5+ - Glenda gets some exercise on her broomstick!  She arrives on d5 and fixes her glare on the BK on f7.",
        "24... Ke8 25. Qg8+": "25. Qg8+ - now she flies to g8 and the BK feels the white heat.  Pity that rook on a8 is defended by the Wicked Witch of the West.",
        "25... Kd7 26. Qxg7": "26. Qxg7 - I now snatch a pawn and am a full exchange up.  However, I must beware because there are still two major pieces and three pawns swarming around Henry at the moment.  I must therefore at least ensure that the two black minor pieces are firmly pinned down.  As an exercise for the Inquest Jury, which two black pieces are pinned at the moment and what by?",
        "26... c4 27. Rd5": "27. Rd5 - prepare to double .....",
        "27... Qa4 28. Rhd1": "28. Rhd1 - and foment trouble!",
        "28... Ke8 29. Qg8+ Kd7 30. Qf7": "30. Qf7 - moving ever closer to the BK.",
        "30... Ra6 31. Rxe5": "31. Rxe5 - now a black pawn disappears off the board and Glenda is getting some assistance.",
        "31... Qxc2": "31. ...... Qxc2 - a strong looking counter-threat on my d1 rook, but, alas, the dark squared bishop on e2 is twice attacked and only defended by the BK.  Now which piece should I take the bishop with?  After considerable thought ..... Rook, I choose you!",
        "32. Rxe7+": "32. Rxe7+ - I felt more comfortable about this move because at least black can be checked along the second rank and there is a possibility of a lawn-mower mate.  Black now waves the white flag.  Gameknot analysis showed that I had a forced mate in a few moves.  After conceding that Low Draw in the Grob game, I was quite relieved to get four of the ten points back and to do it in such an aggressive fashion after my usual diet of passivitis is really something.  I will have another annotation coming soon, so watch this space.  Kind regards - Joanne"
