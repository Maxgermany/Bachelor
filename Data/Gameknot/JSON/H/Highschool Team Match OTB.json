        "3. dxe5 Bxe5 4. Nf3": "attacking the bishop",
        "4... Nc6 5. Bc4 h6": "waste of a tempo, trying to preempt 6. Ng5 and a queen, rook fork",
        "6. Nc3": "taking advantage of the tempo he gave me to develop",
        "6... Nf6 7. Be3": "loses a pawn but the bishop pair is worth it",
