        "1. e4": "This was my first win over the casual level computer(I kept making tactical mistakes), so I decided to share it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy favorite opening move.",

        "2. d4": "Standard French Defense.",
        "2... Nf6": "d5 is usual, but Nf6 is also fine.",
        "3. Nc3": "Threatening to kick the knight back to g8 with e5.  d4 immediately would allow Nd4 and Black could defend Qd3 (or Bd3) with d5.  If exd6 e.p. then Nxd6 regains the pawn and puts the knight on a safe post.",
        "3... Bb4": "Pinning the knight and preparing to meet e5 with Ne4.",
        "4. Bd3": "Protects e4, and starts threat of e5 all over again.  Bxc3 is not bad for white, because the b pawn will be doubled toward the center.",
        "4... d5": "Getting a stake of the center, and threating to win a pawn by dxe5.  However, the d5 square for the knight is now blocked. ",
        "5. e5": "Logical pawn push to displace the knight.",

        "9. a3": "Chasing the bishop.",
        "9... Bxc3+": "This is black's first real mistake.  After Nxc3, there is no way black can protect his e4 pawn (if f5 then exf6 e.p.)  Ba5 was better.   ",

        "16. Qxd4": "Trading off another pair of pawns.",
        "16... Re8+": "Qxc2 was much better.  This move allows me to have two extra pawns.",
        "17. Kd1": "Protecting the pawn.  Kd2 was probably better as it connects the rooks.",
        "17... Bf5": "Allowing me to trade off even more pieces.",

        "18... Qxf5": "Recapturing and threatening the f pawn.",

        "25... Rh5": "Attacking my h pawn.",
        "26. Kd2": "I knew that the computer was not strong in the endgame and took my chances by centralizing my king and opening up my rook.  I did not like the look of h3 because my g pawn would become weak.",

        "27. Rg1": "Forced to protect the g2 pawn.",
        "27... b5": "This move overextends the b pawn and makes it into a target.",
        "28. Kc3": "Heading off toward the b pawn.",
        "28... g5": "Black should start moving his king into the game.  It may be too late as the pawn on g5 prevents the rook from protecting the b pawn from afar.",
        "29. Kd4": "Still going after the pawn.",
        "29... Kg7": "This move probably loses.  Rh5 was much better as it allowed c6 without losing a pawn.",
