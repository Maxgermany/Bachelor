        "1. e4": "This is the first of a hopefully short series of games where I lose primarily after a single blunder. During my current slump in form and rating this has happened a little too often for my liking. I hope that others can learn from my mistakes. This particular game is I believe one of the classic finishes that I totally overlooked.",
        "1... d5": "Scandinavian, my standard response as black to e4 with some mixed success",
        "2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd8": "Perhaps not the best response but it is the third most common on the gameknot database.",
        "4. Bc4 Nc6 5. d3": "opening a nice line for the dsb, perhaps anticipating Bf4 followed by Nb5 (or d5) threatening Nxc7+",
        "5... Nf6 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. h3 Bh5": "This is all fairly standard stuff so far, nothing much to indicate what is to come.",
        "8. Be3 Ne5": "Appears to threaten the white knight and the lsb which I was hoping to take, as the knight is pinned to the queen, my knight appears to be immune, however appearances can be deceptive as we will see.",
        "9. Nxe5": "I rashly assumed this was a blunder, I had anticipated the fork from Nxf7 but when I looked at the possibility of Bxf7, for some reason I overlooked that the knight was attacking d7",
        "9... Bxd1": "This is a complete blunder that loses immediately, better was Bg6 which at least protected the f pawn.",
        "10. Bxf7#": "And there it is. Well played Mody7. \n\n\nThe moral of this tale is if you think you are safe, look again at least once more.\n\n"
