Kb5": "The position is dead: Black cannot penetrate on the K-side (nor can White), and White's King allows no penetration on the Q-side. All both sides can do at this point is trade Bishop moves back and forth, which is pretty much what happened for the next 40 moves. During that time I made at least 10 more draw offers, each one refused while miamere jeered at me for not being able to win. I include those moves now only to put them into the the official record. There will be only one further remark by yours truly.",
