        "1. Nf3": "This blitz was played on a lazy night, and it is not a \"great\" or \"very interesting\" game... we both made a lot of mistakes, and specially a lot of overlooks. I annotate it because I wanted to share some thoughts with my opponent, but I was disconnected. The annotation is mainly for us, but feel free to read and comment. I'm sure more experienced players will find funny my comments, the way I got \"completely lost\" in the middle of the game, and my opponent wasn't daring enough to take full advantage of it. Some nice positions for strategic (more than tactic) analysis can be found in it. ",
        "1... d5 2. d4 Bf5 3. Bf4 e6 4. e3 a6": "This is to avoid the check after c5. It's playable, but I just prefer this line. ",
        "5. c3": "As white, I play myself this, avoiding the over-known c4. ",
        "5... c5 6. Be2": "Accepting the game after c4 by black. I should not, but I didn't remembered when playing. ",
        "6... Qb6 7. Nbd2": "The b2 pawn is poisoned, as known... except that now it isn't, because of the f4 bishop. First overlook prize is mine...",
        "7... Nc6 8. Nb3 Nf6": "dxc, Bxc, NxB, QxN is an exchange of a developed piece against a non developed (but beloved) one. Which is better? ",
        "9. Bd3 Ne4 10. Bxe4": "Normally, I take with the pawn. As white. I felt a little unsure my position will hold, so I tried something new.",
        "10... Bxe4 11. Ne5 f6": "Let's see where it will lead.",
        "12. Nxc6 bxc6 13. dxc5 Bxc5": "Fiinally, white has gone for the exchange. The g2 pawn is poisoned, too. The exchange theory holds. ",
        "14. O-O": "White has sensed I did it for a reason, and preferred to castle. Good. ",
        "14... e5 15. Bg3 O-O-O": "Of course, o-o would have been wiser. But I wanted to grasp some tempoes, and the rook in d1 is just a temptation... When a pawn storm would have opened white's king position. This move is a horrible blunder, as white can go Qg4+, then Qxg7... ",
        "16. Re1": "Nearly useless move, specially if Qg4+ is the alternative. Black is half-cooked after that. ",
        "16... h5 17. Nxc5 Qxc5 18. f3 Bg6": "Black threats h4. ",
        "19. h4": "Wisely. ",
        "19... d4": "I didn't spend too much time calculating, but I felt I had to play this. ",
        "20. Bf2": "And white demonstrated why it was a bad choice. Now, the smple dxc3 would have been fine... except that white will remove the pawns, opening lines to my king... ",
        "20... d3": "Assuming the bishop's control on the black diagonal was not too dangerous. ",
        "21. e4 Qb5": "The queen is the only piece playing, except for the rook defending d3. ",
        "22. Qd2": "White blocks my pawn with his queen, half-condemning it to passivity. Well seen, I'm not able to safely push the pawn while white has his dsb. ",
        "22... Rd7 23. Rec1 Bf7": "I may well control c4 and think about some break in g5. ",
        "24. b3 c5": "Providing a square for the queen, and blocking the white's dsb. It was a bad move, since I need to avoid to expose the only barrier my kingh has. ",
        "25. Rab1 Rhd8": "So I can move any piece without losing control of d3. But better I shielded my king. ",
        "26. a4 Qc6 27. c4": "Opening a line to a5. I have to spend one more tempo because of my bad last move. ",
        "27... Rb7": "Instead, I reassetted my pressures. But it was not a good move. I'm lost, at this point, I must admit. ",
        "28. a5 Rb4": "If Bxc5, The queen takes it back with check, so I don't have to fear for my rook. It shields the a5 pawn from his queen's defence, so maybe I can press it with Qc7. ",
        "29. Be3": "This is a kind of position that only can be broken with a sac but... it is not easy to see. If I could have two pieces on the b column, Bxc5 becomes a possibilty... but I can't!! The queen is dued to c5...",
        "29... Rd7": "Just trying to do something! I never was like this before...",
        "30. Rb2 Qd6 31. Rc3": "Now he controls my movements. Maybe I just had to throw this pawn away...",
        "31... Rbb7": "I have two tempo to triplify d3's defences, if white decide to go Rd1.",
        "32. Kf1": "Interesting idea! But I suspect we both were so cramped that we just wanted to see what will happen. ",
        "32... Kd8": "Well, I'll do the same. Being unable to spot the winning move, I just waited. ",
        "33. Rc1 Ke8 34. Kf2": "Well, I thought white had caught me, since with Rd2 he would have won the pawn. I would probably have sac the bishop on c4 and see.",
        "34... Qc7": "Now is different. White should have moved the other rook instead, so to have three pieces - and no the queen - threatening the d3 pawn. ",
        "35. Ra1": "Covering a5 I targeted. This game requires a very solid strategic knowledge and long thinking, not a blitz...",
        "35... Kf8 36. g3": "Probably white did find the right way: a kinside pawn storm. ",
        "36... Qc8": "Preparing to go h3, if allowed. ",
        "37. Rg1 Rd8 38. f4 Kg8": "Thinking about all sort of complications if fxe, or g4...",
        "39. f5": "White blocks. Does he wants a draw? ",
        "39... Rdd7": "I sensed that g7 would become critical. ",
        "40. g4 Qd8": "Very bad move, that leaves c5 unprotected, and DOESN't defend 5. ",
        "41. gxh5 Bxh5": "I prefer to open the column this way, since I can't avoid that. ",
        "42. Bh6": "Nice but useless. ",
        "42... Kh8 43. Be3 Rbc7": "So I can defend. But I am still unable to coordinate my pieces. I have the two rook dued to the defence of pawns... ugly!",
        "44. Rg3": "The simple b4, here, takes advantage of the fact that if I take the pawn, Bb6 will win an exchange. ",
        "44... Be2": "So I can free one rook... but still in a cradle. ",
        "45. Rh3": "Again, the right threat. ",
        "45... Qe8": "Only move, but here, white can bring reinforces in, so if h5, even if I Bxh5, white will probably win. ",
        "46. Rb1 Qh5": "So now is MY queen blocking his pawn... I've never seen such a bind!",
        "47. Rg1 Bg4": "Very tricky move. If Rg3, threatening the bishop, Qxh5, pinning it. But what after a couple of white moves? ",
        "48. Rh2": "White opts to be conservative. Good for him...",
        "48... Be2 49. Rg3 g5": "Just to see what would he play. Everything so to open a column for my rooks. ",
        "50. Rgh3": "Oh, well, this allows...",
        "50... g4 51. Rg3": "The bind is getting tighter. ",
        "51... Rdg7": "Useless move. I was lost again. ",
        "52. Rh1 Rg8": "The game will be decided on the queenside. Let's prepare for it, considering that the c rook is doomed. ",
        "53. Rh2": "This is a draw request. But I was looking for a plan. ",
        "53... Rb8 54. Qc3 Rb4": "And this was a blunder, a tough one. Now, if Bxc5...",
        "55. Rh1": "Uff!",
        "55... Rcb7": "...and this was a very, very tricky move! White should have gone Ra1, but...",
        "56. Bxc5": "...played quickly. Someting you should never do. It is not just a pawn for a pawn. ",
        "56... Rb4xb3 57. Qd2": "The queen has no escape. ",
        "57... Rb3b2 58. Qe3": "Allowing a dicovered check. ",
        "58... Bf3+ 59. Kg1 Rb2b1+ 60. Kf2 Rb7b2+ 61. Qe2 Rxe2#": "A very difficult sequence to see, specially in such a quiet and sometime pointless game. Thank you for reading!"
