I got into a good position and managed to completely blunder it away. From move 15 on, the analysis shows something wrong with almost all my moves. Sadly for me by this point my opponent had woken up and stopped his similar sequence in the first half of the game",

        "15. Qe4": "I'm trying to work out how to get the most from the b1h7 diagonal, this seemed a decent move to me but the analysis calls it a mistake.
