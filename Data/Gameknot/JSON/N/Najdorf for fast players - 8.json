        "1. e4": "from a najdorf imposed tournament. An interessant sacrifice.",

        "6... Nbd7": "i chose to defend with the second horse, without knowing very well this defence. I was not tempted by e5, because i don't like the line Bxf6, Qxf6, Nd5 that impose black to lose a tempo and offers nice suits for the white horses.",
        "7. Be2 e6": "so, e6 is much more comfortable according to me, but I played various possibilities in this tournament.",
        "8. O-O Be7 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Kh1": "since now, white has chosen a very quite version, without f4. I am glad about that. I hate f4... when i am black",
        "10... h6 11. Bh4 Nc5": "let's have some action...",
        "12. Bd3 Nfxe4": "let's win a pawn",
        "13. Nxe4 Bxh4 14. Nf3 Nxe4 15. Bxe4 Bf6": "and the combination terminates with a pawn in my pocket and the pair of bishops.",
        "16. c4 Qb6": "good position, as the white knight is temporarily impeached by the Bf6 and white has lost his black bishop.",
        "17. Rab1": "to free the queen's moves.",
        "17... Rd8": "mine too",
        "18. b3": "to free the rook's moves",
        "18... d5": "let's free some space... and a trick too...",
        "19. cxd5 exd5 20. Bd3": "didn't fall into it: if 20. Bxd5, then Be6, would lose it. well seen, philipdor",
        "20... Be6": "engaging finally bishop and rooks",
        "21. Qe2": "this is obscure to me",
        "21... Rac8 22. Rfe1": "my bishop is well protected. His cannot arm mine... so what is the point? A long time plan trying to mate on 8th line?",
        "22... Rc3 23. Rec1": "he already renounced",
        "23... Rdc8 24. Rxc3 Rxc3 25. Qd2": "looks like we are waiting for the draw...",
        "25... Qc7 26. Qe3": "by trying to move as less as possible, and surveyboth bishop (why not remove it??) and c1 (threatening a little bit mate), black gives me the opportunity to give back the pawn and... possibly win a piece.",
        "26... d4": "will you take my poor pawn?",
        "27. Nxd4": "yes you did, but...",
        "27... Bxd4": "... was your knight really protected? no, it was not, because, now, i threats mate in three if you take it.",
        "28. Qd2": "and so, the knigt has been lost...",
        "28... Bf6": "get back safely...",
        "29. h3": "not avoinding mate yet as the queen still survey the angle.",
        "29... Bg5": "so let us go, so we can exchange rooks, at least.",
        "30. Qe2 Rc1+ 31. Rxc1 Qxc1+": "so it is",
        "32. Kh2 Qc7+ 33. Kg1 Kf8": "and now, the endgame.",
        "34. Be4 Bf4 35. g3": "weakening h3",
        "35... Bd6 36. h4 a5": "queen side attacks...",
        "37. Qb5": "some last tries.",
        "37... b6 38. Qd3 Bd7 39. Qd5 Qc5 40. Qa8+": "a last one. Always some adrenaline comes in me in these case: did i forget something? a stalemate?",
        "40... Ke7 41. Qa6 Bxg3": "well i can take back my pawn lost anyway",
        "42. Qe2 Be5": "and you have nothing left... step by step, i just took advantage of my opponent's mistake, except maybe for the first -not-deciding- pawn."
