        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6": "[It goes without saying that Caruana is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on the Gruenfeld defence.]",
        "3. f3": "!? [Carlsen \u201cfinally\u201d plays something concrete against the Gruenfeld. He\u2019s been toying with a host of off-beat systems against this opening lately, but today it seems that he is fully prepared for a sharp theoretical battle. We should add that this move prepares to take the centre with e4, but the main difference between this move]\n\n[and the more natural 3.Nc3 is that in the latter case, Black can trade a pair of knights with 3\u2026d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3]",
        "3... d5": "[Following the Gruenfeld course is Caruana\u2019s favorite and usually the most natural choice for Gruenfeld players in this position. However, I will give a small expose on a number of other options for Black, which might be a good starting point for those interested in learning this interesting line.]\n\n[King\u2019s indian players prefer 3\u2026Bg7 4.e4 d6 which usually transposes into the main lines of the Saemisch KID after 5.Nc3 (although another interesting development scheme exists \u2013 5.Ne2!? 0\u20130 6.Nec3 aiming to develop the knight from b1 to d2 or a3.) 5\u20260\u20130 etc.; Another popular approach is \u201cTango\u201d style 3\u2026Nc6!? to which White usually responds with 4.d5 Ne5 5.e4 d6 6.Nc3 etc. with complex play.; Benoni aficionados would probably go for 3\u2026c5 4.d5 Bg7 5.e4 d6 6.Nc3 e6; and those willing to experiment with totally unorthodox positions might try 3\u2026e6 4.e4 d5; or even 3\u2026e5 4.dxe5 Nh5 although this line may be too risky as the following game shows: 5.Nh3 Nc6 6.Bg5 Be7 7.Bxe7 Qxe7 8.g4 Ng7 9.f4 d6 10.exd6 Qh4+ 11.Nf2 Bxg4 12.dxc7 Be6 13.Qd2 0\u20130 14.Nc3 Bxc4 15.e4 Bxf1 16.Rxf1 Rac8 17.Nd5 Ne8 18.Qc3 Ne7 19.Qh3 1\u20130 (19) Hammer,J (2633)-Yankovsky,R (2474) Las Vegas 2012]",
        "4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4": "[We can see now that white has avoided the knight exchange by postponing Nc3 and he still has a strong center. The f3 move has other drawbacks though, but to paraphrase an old saying: \u201cno move is perfect\u201d.]",
        "5... Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2": "[Quite naturally, White prepares to castle long and follow up with a typical kingside attack: Bh6, h4\u2013h5 etc.]",
        "8... Nc6": "[The first small junction.]\n\n[8\u2026e5 9.d5 c6 was topical for a while, but a few nice white wins after 10.h4 cxd5 11.exd5 N8d7 12.h5 Nf6 13.hxg6 fxg6 14.0\u20130\u20130 have generally discouraged black from challenging white center in such a direct manner. However, the line is not dead yet, as it was succesfully employed by Gelfand in the 2012 WCh match against Anand. For those interested in playing it, I suggest coming up with some improvement with engine assistance and triple-checking your analysis before the game.]",
        "9. O-O-O Qd6": "!? [This move is the new hit. Caruana has already played 4 games with it, losing two and drawing the other two. His decision to stick with it is a sign that he has upgraded his analysis.]\n\n[A long time ago, the principled looking 9\u2026e5 10.d5 Nd4 was played almost exclusively, but things have proved to be a little suspicious for black after 11.f4 etc.; Another common approach is 9\u2026f5 10.e5 Nb4 11.Nh3 Be6 although it has been going through a certain crisis over the past few years.]",
        "10. Nb5": "[Immediately attacking the queen is the most popular move here.]\n\n[Last year, Nakamura has challenged Caruana with 10.h4 Rd8 11.Nb5 Qd7 12.h5 a6 13.Nc3 when the young American-Italian blundered with 13\u2026Nxd4 (13\u2026Bxd4 is possible as well.) 14.hxg6 hxg6?? (14\u2026fxg6 15.g4would lead to a complicated position.) 15.Bxd4 Qxd4 (or 15\u2026Bxd4 16.Qh6 and black loses a lot of material)16.Qe1 and black had to give up the queen for no compensation in Nakamura,H (2772)-Caruana,F (2779) Elancourt FRA 2013, 1\u20130 (34).]",
        "10... Qd7 11. Kb1": "[The last word of theory. Several moves have been tried here with pretty good success for white. The theory of this line is still developing, so I will just mention a few recent games that are relevant for the 9\u2026Qd6 line. The reader is free to explore them more deeply at his leasure.]\n\n[11.f4 Qe6 12.Nc3 Nc4 13.Qe2 Nxe3 14.Qxe3 Nb4 15.Kb1 c6 16.Nf3 Nd5! 17.Nxd5 cxd5 18.e5 and black was doing ok in a game that was played just a few days ago: Bachmann,A (2589)-Kovchan,A (2558) Zalakaros HUN 2014, 0\u20131 (36), although he won the game only after his opponent blundered.; 11.Bh6 Bxh6 12.Qxh6 a6 13.Nc3 Nxd4 14.f4 f6 15.Nf3 e5 16.fxe5 fxe5 17.Nxe5 Qd6 18.Nf3 c5 19.Bd3 Qf4+ 20.Qxf4 Rxf4 21.Nxd4 cxd4 and players reached a drawish endgame in Sadler,M (2646)-Svidler,P (2758) London ENG 2013, 1/2 (44).]",
        "11... Rd8": "[The optimistic experiment 11\u2026f5 didn\u2019t end well for black after 12.h4! fxe4 13.h5 e5 14.d5 Nd4 15.Nxd4 exd4 16.Bxd4 Qxd5 17.Bxb6! Qxd2 18.Rxd2 axb6 19.Bc4+ Kh8 20.hxg6 and white soon won in Laznicka,V (2677)-Zhigalko,A (2619) Warsaw POL 2013, 1\u20130 (31) .]",
        "12. d5": "[The pressure on d4 became unbearable (a6 was threatening), so white pushes the pawn further.]",
        "12... a6 13. Nc3": "[13.dxc6 wins a pawn after 13\u2026Qxd2 14.Rxd2 Rxd2 15.Bxd2 axb5 16.cxb7 but Black gets a strong compensation after (or 16.Bxb5 bxc6 17.Bxc6 Rb8) 16\u2026Bxb7 17.Bxb5 Rd8]",
        "13... Qe8": "[A very useful move. The queen gets out of the way of the other pieces and wants to use the pin to break white\u2019s center with e7\u2013e6 push.]",
        "14. Qc1": "[Carlsen deviates from the game Gelfand-Caruana in Zurich last year. With this move he still keeps his attacking prospects with Bh6 open.]\n\n[Gelfand copied Caruana\u2019s queen manoeuvre with 14.Qe1 and the game continued 14\u2026Na7!? 15.h4 Nb5 16.Nge2 Nc4 17.Bd4 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Nb6 19.h5 e6 20.hxg6 hxg6 21.f4 giving rise to a sharp play where black was doing great. The game, however, ended in a draw.]",
        "14... Na5 15. Bh6": "[A logical follow-up.]\n\n[It might seem like 15.Bxb6 cxb6 16.b4 wins a piece here, but black has a nice tactic 16\u2026Bd7! 17.bxa5 Rac8 18.Nge2 Rxc3! 19.Nxc3 Rc8 that equalizes the game after 20.Rd3 Bb5 21.Re3 Bxf1 22.Rxf1 Bxc3 23.Rxc3 Rxc3 24.Qxc3 Qb5+ The point! 25.Kc2 Qxf1; A recent game Berczes,D (2497)-Sarkar,J (2452) Dallas USA 2014, 1/2 (45) saw 15.h4 e6 16.Bg5 f6 17.Bd2 Nbc4 18.Bh6 Bxh6 19.Qxh6 exd5 20.h5 d4 with a complicated position, when black was, again, doing more than fine.]",
        "15... Bxh6": "[Caruana shows that he knows in\u2019s and out\u2019s of this line.]\n\n[The immediate 15\u2026e6 would be inferior as after 16.Bxg7 Kxg7 17.h4 exd5 18.h5 the king is more exposed on g7 than g8.]",
        "16. Qxh6 e6 17. Nh3": "[Threatening Ng5 and Qxh7.]\n\n[If white attacks with 17.h4 exd5 18.h5 black wins an important defensive tempo with 18\u2026Qf8! since the queen trade is in his favor.]",
        "17... Qe7": "[Caruana decides to stop the threat with defense along the 7th rank,]\n\n[although chasing the queen away from h6 with 17\u2026Qf8 was a noteworthy alternative.]",
        "18. Bd3": "! [I was wondering what Carlsen would play in this position as it seemed that his attack has come to a halt. He came up with a very interesting pawn sacrifice that allows him to complete the development.]\n\n[18.Ng5?! would only help black 18\u2026f6 19.Nxe6 Bxe6 20.dxe6 Rxd1+ 21.Nxd1 Qxe6 and it\u2019s already white who fights for equality here.; 18.Nf4 e5 19.Nd3 seemed quite decent. With the knight out of the way, white is ready to push h4. But black probably equalizes after 19\u2026c6 20.Qe3 Nac4 21.Qc5 Qxc5 22.Nxc5 Ne3 etc.]",
        "18... e5": "[Caruana decides to refuse the Greek gift and probably rightly so.]\n\n[White\u2019s attack after 18\u2026exd5 19.Nf4! looks scary in all variations. 19\u2026Be6 (19\u2026c6 20.exd5 cxd5 21.Nh5!; 19\u2026d4 20.Ncd5 Qe5 21.h4; 19\u2026dxe4 20.Nxe4 followed by Ng5 or Nh5.) 20.Nh5! (or 20.h4) ]",
        "19. Nf2": "[However, with the closed center, white now has a free hand on the kingside. If black doesn\u2019t manage to push c6 soon to break white\u2019s center, he will find himself in a difficult position with little counterplay.]",
        "19... Nbc4": "[Caruana activates his idle knights.]\n\n[It turns out that 19\u2026c6 is one move too slow due to 20.h4 cxd5 21.h5 Qf8 22.Qg5! f6 23.Qc1 d4 24.hxg6 hxg6 25.Nd5! and white has a crushing attack.]",
        "20. h4 Rd6": "!? [A move that black probably doesn\u2019t want to make as this blocking square is usually reserved for the knight, but it stops h5 for the time being.]\n\n[The active try 20\u2026Qb4 runs into 21.Bxc4 Nxc4 22.Nd3]",
        "21. Bxc4": "[I was a little puzzled by this positional decision. Trading the bishop has positive sides, like freeing the d3 square for the knight, but I think it also makes black\u2019s life easier.]\n\n[That being said, I think it was better to avoid exchanges and immediately play 21.Qc1 b5 22.h5 g5 23.b3 Nb6 when black has two clumsy knights to worry about, rather than one, like in the game.]",
        "21... Nxc4 22. Qc1": "[Making h5 thrust possible.]",
        "22... b5": "[This move is strategically risky as it weakens the queenside, but black can hardly do without it.]\n\n[If he plays 22\u2026c6 now, white obtains a nice advantage with simple forcing moves: 23.b3 Nb6 24.Qe3 cxd5 25.exd5 f5 26.Rhe1; On the other hand, 22\u2026Rb6 is simply answered by 23.Nd3]",
        "23. Nd3": "[Now white controls critical squares b4 and c5 and all he needs to do is take measures against c7\u2013c6. If he manages to do that, his position will be clearly better simply because he controls more space and his pieces are superior to his opponents.]",
        "23... Bd7 24. b3 Nb6 25. h5 g5": "[Up to this point, Carlsen played a perfect game. But now he plays a careless move that throws away everything he\u2019s been working for\u2026]\n\n[Allowing white to open the h-file 25\u2026c6 26.hxg6 fxg6 would be terrible risky. White can continue 27.Rh6 Rf8 28.Qa3! with dangerous threats all over the board.]",
        "26. g3": "?? [The idea of opening up the kingside with f4 is sound, but the timing is completely off. Black now gets the time to open the center with c6.]\n\n[Carlsen should have simply played 26.Qe3 when c6 is impossible as the knight on b6 is hanging. If black tries to defend it with 26\u2026Rb8 white can answer (26\u2026a5 may be a little better, but white still keeps a clear positional advantage with 27.Qc5 b4 28.Nb5 Bxb5 29.Qxb5) 27.Qc5 c6?! 28.Nb4! with a winning position.]",
        "26... c6": "[Just in time! Now the game becomes completely unclear.]",
        "27. f4": "[The best chance.]",
        "27... cxd5 28. Nxe5": "? [But this move is a mistake.]\n\n[White has to play 28.fxe5 and then 28\u2026Rc6 29.Qd2 Be6 leads to a dynamically balanced position. Black\u2019s chances may be slightly better, but this was definitely better choice than the game continuation.]",
        "28... d4": "! [This move works due to a nice tactic that Carlsen may have missed somewhere in his previous calculations. Now black takes over the control of the game.]",
        "29. Qa3": "[Trying to utilize the pin on Rd6.]\n\n[The point is that 29.Ne2 is answered by 29\u2026Bc6! 30.Nxc6 Qxe4+ and Black is on top.]",
        "29... a5 30. Nxb5": "?! [Maybe not a bad practical decision, but definitely giving up a piece can\u2019t be right from a purely chess perspective. But this move gives us some valuable insight into the inner workings of the world champion. This is not the first time he gives up material in a troublesome position in order to keep his opponent busy and maintain piece coordination. He likes to do this especially as the time trouble approaches, putting additional psychological pressure on his opponents and making conversion of the advantage more difficult.]\n\n[30.Nd5 Nxd5 31.exd5 was objectively better, but Carlsen probably judged that Caruana would find the best moves more easily in this kind of position than the game.]",
        "30... Bxb5 31. Rxd4": "[White has two pawns for the piece and some activity to show for it. Generally speaking, though, black should win this game with precise play.]",
        "31... Re6": "[Black doesn\u2019t lose any of his advantage by exchanging queens.]\n\n[However, he could have also avoided the queen swap with 31\u2026Rad8 32.Rhd1 Nc8! (The tempting 32\u2026Rxd4? 33.Qxe7 Rxd1+ would be a huge mistake as white\u2019s threats are far more serious than black\u2019s. 34.Kb2) 33.Rxd6 Nxd6 and if 34.Qxa5 f6 Sometimes, especially with exposed kings, this kind of material advantage can be converted more easily with queens on the board.]",
        "32. Qxe7 Rxe7 33. Rc1 Nd7": "! [The knight on e5 holds white\u2019s position together, so this move makes the most sense.]\n\n[33\u2026f6 would only create additional weaknesses in black\u2019s camp. 34.Ng4 would follow, with a sufficient compensation.]",
        "34. Rc7 Nxe5": "? [The right idea, but wrong execution. Caruana maybe got a little excited, or he was in a slight time trouble, so he forgot]\n\n[an important intermediate move 34\u2026gxf4! and after 35.gxf4 (The point being that 35.Nxd7 is answered by35\u2026f3! 36.Nf6+ Kg7! 37.Rxe7 f2 38.Rd1 Kxf6 and Black wins.) 35\u2026Nxe5 36.Rxe7 Nc6 37.Rd5 Nxe7 38.Rxb5 Nc6 we reach a similar position as in the game, but with an extra pawn for black. His extra piece should definitely prevail in this endgame.]",
        "35. Rxe7 Nc6": "[Nicely using the geometry on white rooks.]",
        "36. Rd5": "[But white has a trump of his own. This move keeps Carlsen in the game.]",
        "36... Bd3+": "! [An important intermezzo.]\n\n[36\u2026Nxe7? fails to the intermediate move 37.Rxg5+ Kf8 38.Rxb5 and with three pawns for the piece white already has little to worry about.]",
        "37. Rxd3 Nxe7 38. fxg5": "[We have reached an unusual endgame where white has, let\u2019s say, 2 and a half pawns for the piece. Black should have better chances to win the game, than to draw, but Carlsen is known as a very resourceful defender, so it might be closer to 50\u201350 in this case.]",
        "38... Rb8 39. Rd7": "?! [It is clear that black wants to play Rb5, leaving the eight rank open, so why waste time on this manoeuvre?]\n\n[It would have been more purposeful to activate the king, for example 39.Kb2]",
        "39... Kf8 40. Ra7 Rb5 41. Ra8+ Kg7 42. Re8": "[An interesting try was 42.Ra6!? hoping for 42\u2026Rxg5 (However, black can just play 42\u2026Rc5! followed by Nc6 etc.) 43.h6+ Kh8 and then (43\u2026Kf8?? 44.Ra8+) 44.Kc2 and white will eventually win the a-pawn with good drawing chances.]",
