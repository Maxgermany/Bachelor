Now perhaps..bf5  isn't necessary, but I found a long mating net. That seemed a pretty sure thing. On the other hand, if the king can avoid check for just one move, the black queen will probably insert herself into the situation and white's attack will be halted. \n\nHere is what may happen.\n\n\n(black to move)\n1.\te4\tb6\n2.\td4\tBb7\n3.\tc4\tBxe4\n4.\tNc3\tBb7\n5.\tNf3\te6\n6.\tBd3\tNf6\n7.\tBg5\tBe7\n8.\tO-O\th6\n9.\tBxf6\tBxf6\n10.\tBe4\tc6\n11.\tRe1\tO-O\n12.\tBc2\td6\n13.\tQd3\tRe8\n14.\tQh7 \tKf8\n15.\td5\tBxc3\n16.\tdxe6\tBxe1\n17.\tQh8 \tKe7\n18.\tQxg7\tBxf2 \n19.\tKxf2\tKxe6\n20.\tBf5 \tKxf5\n21.\tNd4 \tKe4\n22.\tRe1 \tKd3\n23.\tQg3 \tKxc4\n24.\tQc3 \tKd5\n25.\tQb3 \tKc5\n26.\tQc3 \tKd5\n27.\tQf3 \tKc4\n28.\tRc1 \tKxd4\n29.\tRd1 \tKe5\n30.\tRe1 \tKd4\n31.\tQc3 \tKd5\n32.\tQd3 \tKc5\n33.\tRc1 \tKb4\n34.\tRc4 \tKb5\n35.\tQb3 \tKa5\n36.\tRa4#\t\nCHECKMATE\n\nNow this attack was - it is true - speculative. But down a pawn, I looked forward to slow death if I played it safe. \n\nBut while I thought I had a mating net, I think black can find safety on the a4 and b4 squares, shuttling back and forth.  The problem is that white needs to bring the rook into the final mating step, and if black plays carefully, I don't see how white can weave the mating net. \n\nInstead, it is a draw.",
