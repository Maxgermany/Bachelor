        "15... Bg6 16. Nxg6": "This is also probably not the best idea. The knight on e5 is very strong while bishop on g6 is weak. The exchange is clearly in black's favor.",
        "16... hxg6 17. g5": "Another move that will later benefit the black. The black knight gets an excellent place on f5 from where it will control half the board.",
        "17... Ne8 18. Nd2 Nd6 19. Nb3 Nf5 20. Nxa5 Qxa5 21. Qd2 c5": "The black starts to use weakness of white's position.",
        "22. b4 cxb4 23. cxb4 Qb6 24. Rfd1": "Probably another rook should be placed on d1: Rad1. The rook on f1 would be protecting f4 pawn.",
        "24... e3": "Now f4 pawn will be in constand danger. Also black's pawn on e3 is getting close to the first line.",
        "25. Qd3": "I was expecting Qb2 with equal chances. The white decides to open things up.",
        "25... Qxb4 26. Rab1 Qe7 27. Bf3 Rad8 28. Rb5 Nh4": "This move serves couple of purposes - attacking a bishop (currently bishop prevents black from playing ...e2) and attacking f4 pawn. ",
        "29. Bxd5+ Rxd5": "The white clearly did not think of this possibility",
        "30. Qc4 Kh7 31. Qxd5 Rxf4": "Suddenly it's over. The black is too close and white's king is unprotected. 32. Q:b7 or 32. R:b7 loses to 32... e2!! with mate to follow.\r\nNote the difference between the white and black king's positions - the black one is quite comfortable and the white one is fully exposed. "
