        "1. Nc3": "Think they call this the dunst?",
        "1... d5 2. e4 dxe4": "Maybe I should play d4 but I like this line",
        "3. Nxe4 e5 4. Bc4 Bf5": "Probably a mistake in hindsight but looked good at the time!",
        "5. Qf3": "Strong move, making Bf5 look bad.",
        "5... Bg6 6. h4": "Looks pretty toothless to me..",
        "6... Qd7": "The point is to force my bishop away from the defence of the mate on f7 but this covers it nicely.",
        "7. h5 Bxe4": "Forced.",
        "8. Qxe4 Nc6": "forced again.",
        "9. d3 Bb4+": "I know he ( and I ) am going to castle long, so thought I'd force c3 to weaken his queenside a bit.",
        "10. c3 Bd6 11. Bg5 f6": "Have to play this. leaves me open to Bxg8, Rxg8, Qxh7, 0-0-0. But I think black is fine there.",
        "12. Be3": "He agrees apparently",
        "12... O-O-O": "Now I castle",
        "13. O-O-O": "as does he",
        "13... Nge7": "also considering Na5 but think this is more solid and requires less analysis ;)\n\nWhite - 15 minutes\nBlack  - 16 minutes",
        "14. Ne2 g5": "Intending to follow up with f5. Also inviting hxg6, which I'm fine with.",
        "15. hxg6 e.p. hxg6 16. b4": "Maybe there is better counterplay for white..",
        "16... g5": "for the same reasons as last time I played it.",
        "17. g3": "providing an escape square for the queen.",
        "17... Rdf8": "Providing an extra kick for f5, being able to follow it up with f4, and then f3 forking the queen and knight.",
        "18. d4": "Providing a much needed escape route for the queen, maybe a weakening move structuarly though..",
        "18... f5": "here come the pawns..",
        "19. Qc2 f4 20. dxe5": "probably a mistake. I should exchange rooks before playing my next move.",
        "20... Nxe5": "Should exchange rooks. He can exchange the rooks and pin the knight against the rook with the bishop here. \n\nWhite - 5 minutes\nBlack  - 12 minutes",
        "21. Bd4": "Luckily he misses it in time trouble and (like me) plays it a move too early",
        "21... Rxh1": "winning a piece",
        "22. Rxh1 Nxc4 23. Qb3 Qe6": "threatening the knight. it can only drop back to g1, which loses",

        "24... f3": "winning the knight",
        "25. Qa4": "A move that definitely has holes in, but hard to spot in the nick of time!\n\nWhite - 3 minutes\nBlack  - 5 minutes",
        "25... a6": "The wrong move. Underestimating b5.",
        "26. b5 Ba3+": "have to try and mate him now\n\nWhite - 1 minute\nBlack  - 4 minutes",
        "27. Kc2 Qf5+ 28. Kb3": "His moves play themselves yet I have to try and dig out a mate!",
        "28... Qd5": "bad move. He should just take the knight here. But he has no time to think",
        "29. Kc2 Qe4+ 30. Kb3 Nd2+": "White loses on time. Think I have this won anyway, Kxa6, Qe6 and black is winning. Last few moves were a bit crazy but had to be made in seconds!"
