        "9... Kxf7": "Now out of place this has eliminated the kings ability to \"Castle\"",
        "10. b4": "Looking back, I cannot see why I made this move. I can only assume I didn't see the bishop.",
        "10... Bxa1": "The bishop now at a1 will pose a significant problem later.",
        "11. bxc5 h5 12. gxh6 e.p. Qh4+": "Queen advancing on me prompting evasive action",

        "19. Kd1": "With the threat of checkmate if the queen moves to e2 I retreat to the safety of an escape route.",
        "19... Qxf1+": "Of course this means I lose a rook and get into check again. At this point being 12 points down I was thinking that the game was pretty much over and slowed down my moves focussing on other games. Had this been a casual game I might well have resigned at this point. But this was a mini tournament and every half point counted. Eventually I started to look seriously at a plan of recovery and used the \"Analyse\" facility to structure a way out.",
        "20. Kc2": "First I needed to get out the way whilst being mindful of the bishop at a1",
        "20... Rh1": "Rook now backing up Queen along the first rank",

        "25... Qc4+": "Another check",
        "26. Qb4": "Blocked again",
        "26... Rb1": "At this point my opponent made an error by threatening my queen. Retrospectively I think he should have put me in check with his queen at c6 or c2. This would have given him the advantage of threatening my pawns at b7 and a2 and also capturing my queen with his rook. Instead the rook was placed at b1 which allowed me to eliminate his queen.",
        "27. Qxc4": "Queen gone",
        "27... Rxb7": "OK. So now I have reduced his attacking power dramatically whilst sacrificing my planned pawn promotion. The focus now is on destroying as many pieces as I can and advancing the pawn from a2 to secure a future promotion.",

        "39. Kb3": "Now out of harms way",
        "39... Rd2": "Not quite sure why this move was played, but it has given me a good opportunity - with the current position of his king and the move just made gives me the chance to move in on the rook",
        "40. Qc7+": "Check - with only 4 moves for the king he chooses to go under cover of the pawns",
        "40... Kf6": "This, however, was all part of my plan",
        "41. Qc3+": "check and capture of rook",
        "41... Ke7": "king retreat",
        "42. Qxd2": "rook gone",
        "42... Ne4": "attack on queen",
        "43. Qb4+": "counter attack on king",
        "43... Kf6": "At this point my opponent must have seen the obvious move and offered a \"draw\". Having come back from -18 to +4 I was not going to do that. With this in mind I did not see the checkmate with my queen at f8. Instead I focussed on promoting my pawn up the left side.",
        "44. a4": "It was only after I had submitted my move that I saw the missed checkmate. This became a little frustrating as my opponent tends to use nearly 15 days per move when he is losing.",

        "49... f3": "counter advance",
        "50. a7": "still moving up",
        "50... f2": "still moving down",
        "51. Qh8+": "time now to eliminate the pawn at f2. In this attack the king can only move on the diagonal which can also be threatened from h2",
        "51... Nf6": "knight blocks threat",
        "52. Qh2+": "and there we have it. Another pawn going down",
