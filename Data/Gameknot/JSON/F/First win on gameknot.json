        "1. e4": "I have joined Gameknot two days ago. I like how it looks and that I can play rated games. This game is very interesting to me because I missed a very easy tactic move with my knight several times in a row - in internet slow game with three days per move.",
        "1... e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nxe4": "Petroff - Morphy often played this one",
        "4. Qe2": "!? New move for me",
        "4... d5 5. Nxe5 Be7 6. d3 dxc4 7. Qxe4 cxd3 8. Nxd3 O-O 9. O-O Nc6 10. a3": "Bad - Bf4 is better move, this waste tempo which is valuable in open centrer game",
        "10... Re8 11. Qf3 Be6": "Missed opportunity for: 11. ...Nd4 12. Qd1 Bg4 13. Qg4: Nc2: with Ra1 and Nd3 hanging",
        "12. b3 Bf6": "12. ...Nd4 still works: 13.Qd1 Bf5",
        "13. Bb2 Bxb2 14. Nxb2 Qd4": "14. ...Nd4 15.Qd1 (15.Qc3?? Ne2 ) Qf6 -  \nI didn't see Nd4 tatctics at all. Shall I ever correct that?",
        "15. c3 Qe5 16. Nd3 Qg5 17. h3": "Bad - loosing pawn for nothing. 17.c4 or 17.Nd2 is must",
        "17... Bxb3 18. a4": "White doesn't know what he is doing: let's move a bishop around",
        "18... Bc4 19. Rd1 Rad8 20. Na3 Bb3": "I'm not happy with this move, if I take a pawn I still leave my queen side pawns opened to rook attacks. There is also pin not allowing me to play b6.",
        "21. Rdc1": "Bad - Now I have forcing queen exchange with getting another pawn. I think Rdb1 is more attacking.",
        "21... Bd5 22. Qg3 Qxg3 23. fxg3 Bxg2 24. Rc2": "Blunder and game over",
        "24... Bxh3": ""
