        "14. e5": "so ee it was, I consider it as a worst move than my proposed d5 as it puts another pawn in a dark square, leaving me with the chance of playing e6 with all my pawns on light squares and a good bishop against white's weaker bishop, plus my pawn majority on the queen side might be an advantage in the endgame, for now white has more space and a better centre...",

        "18... e6": "I don't like the prospect of having to defend the weakness of my e6 pawn against Ng5 but this move places all my pawns on dark squares that may be enough compensation for that weakness"
