        "1. e4 c5 2. Qh5": "My friend must have been travel-weary. He never makes this kind of error.",
        "2... Nc6 3. Qxc5": "The free Pawn is tempting, but White's development is already starting to lag.",
        "3... e6": "Opening a line for the Bishop with tempo, as the Q is again attacked.",
        "4. Qc4 d5": "White's Q would be best served to get behind the lines quickly so his other pieces can develop.",
        "5. exd5 exd5 6. Qe2+": "Hoping for 6... Q-K2?, which would allow the exchange of Queens and give White time to develop his pieces.",
        "6... Be7": "No such luck.",
        "7. d3 Nf6": "Black has 3 minor pieces developed to White's none. If he can attack quickly, White's defenses will be unready.",
        "8. Bg5": "Finally developing a piece! But it's too little, too late.",
        "8... O-O 9. Qf3": "Yet another Queen move! 9 N-QB3 would allow White to castle into relative safety. Now his King will be caught in the center. [If Black tries to win the Q via a pin on the K file, White has just enough time to get away: 9 N-QB3 R-K1 10 O-O-O B-Q3 and the White Q is free to escape the Rook's attack.]",
        "9... Nd4": "Forcing the Q to move yet again!",
        "10. Qd1 Re8": "With the threat of 11... B-N5 mate! Double checks are probably the most powerful weapon on the chessboard.",
        "11. c3": "Stopping the mate.",
        "11... a6": "A waiting move, hoping White will fall into the trap.",
        "12. cxd4": "Whoopsie! White got greedy and forgot that the pawn was the only thing preventing...",
        "12... Bb4#": "...this finish. My friend, in a mastery of understatement, sent this with a note reading \"Not my best effort.\" I'd wholeheartedly agree."
