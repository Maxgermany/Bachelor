        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4": "up until recently, I always looked down upon c4 as a false move in this Sicilian setup, Hungarian style; in my opinion, Bf1 would always be hindered in its development, making e4 in fact a redundant move... this game however learned me, this setup is part of the English Party, a flank opening usually enforced by Nc3... this move always induces a closed Sicilian; we need to work this out for the future...",
        "3... Bg7 4. d4 cxd4": "at this level of play, I learned not to trust dxc5, Qa5+ anymore... the upcoming Nc3, will always force d6; so we better prepare for that...",
        "5. Nxd4 Nf6": "in this variation, there is no time for playing e6, Ne7, 0-0, to prepare d5... after e6, Nc3, Ne7, the threat of Nb5 poses too much problems... so we need to switch plans...",
        "6. Nc3 d6 7. Be2 Nbd7 8. Be3 Nc5 9. f3": "instead of Bf3, 0-0, 0-0... White is switching to an English setup...",
        "9... O-O 10. O-O Re8 11. Qd2 Bd7 12. Rad1": "not clear, what White is planning here... b4, Na4, Nd5, looks much better...",
        "12... Rc8 13. b4 Na4 14. Nxa4 Bxa4 15. Rdc1 a6": "so far, so good...",
        "16. Bd3 Nd7 17. f4": "better first Qf2, looks much better; now, e4 will become a target after e5, somewhere followed by Bc6...",
        "17... e5 18. Ne2": "after fxe5, Nxe5, also attacking c4 and Bd3...",
        "18... exf4 19. Nxf4": "the best move; after Bc6, we need Nd5...",
        "19... Bh6": "clever move, if I may say so myself; after Bc6, Nd5, Bxd5, exd5, Black isn't getting anywhere soon, and f5 looks drafty... this move hinders a direct Nd5, due to Bxe3+, Qxe3, Ne5, and White is getting in all sorts of trouble... now, Qf2 is practically forced, upon which Black can choose from either Ne5 (also covering f7) or directly Bc6, putting e4 to the test; after Qf2, Bc6 (or first Bxe3+), Nd5, Bxd5, f7 is also (temporarily) covered...",
        "20. Nd5": "still better than Qf2, Bc6, after a closer look...",
        "20... Bxe3+ 21. Qxe3": "somewhat better seems maybe Nxe3, Qh4! (Qg5, Rf3, Ne5, Rg3), Rc3 (against Ne5), Bc6...",
        "21... Bc6": "the object is simple: Bxd5, or after Nc3/Nf4, Ne5... a direct Ne5?, fails on Nf6+",
        "22. Qh6": "unclear what White is up to here; apart from Nc3/Nf4, the only other option to keep things together was Qf2: then, after trading on d5, Ne5 is forced; that way White may create play after c5... this move is getting Whites' Queen too far from the action...",
        "22... Bxd5": "instead, Blacks' play is opening up; after exd5 (better not cxd5, considering Blacks' next move), Qb6+ (another reason for 22. Qf2), Kh1, e.g. Qxb4...",
        "23. exd5": "not much difference makes cxd5, Qb6+...",
        "23... Qb6+ 24. Kh1": "after c5, dxc5, Kh1 (Qf4, cxb4+, Kh1, f6!), cxb4, with roughly the same result...",
        "24... Ne5": "the main threat being of course Nxd3 (which can be countered by Qf4) and Qxb4; after Qd2 - to cover for both Bd3 and b4 - follows Qd4, Rd1, Qxd3, Qxd3, Nxd3, Rxd3, Rxc4...",
        "25. Be2": "better was Qf4, to prevent Nxd3?, Qxf2+, Kh8, Qf6+, Kg8, and the game is drawn in perpetual check...",
        "25... Qxb4 26. Rcb1 Qa4": "stronger is Qa5 or Qa3, to prevent both Rb2 and Qd2... but is of no matter anymore; Bd3 is getting into trouble......",
        "27. Rxb7": "White breaks up the tensions; there was still some defense left in Qd2 or Rb2...",
        "27... Qxa2 28. Bd3": "the losing move; only Qe3 might be of use; then follows Nxc4! (Rb8, Ra7, a5, Qf2), Qf2 (Bxc4, Qxc4, Qf3, f5), Ne5 (forced), Rxf7, Qxd5, the only way, otherwise White gets good drawing chances or even worse...",
        "28... Ref8": "the move, White had overlooked; Ne5 no longer needs to protect f7...",
        "29. h4": "sacrificing a piece for a non-existent attack; after Nxd3, there is always back to Ne5... the attempt Qh3 (Qe3, Qa3 will lose all), Rb8, Rxb8, Rxb8, Qe3, Qb3, Qa7, fails on Qb6, Qe7, Qb7... after Nxd3, Qg5 (to prepare h5), fails on simply Ne5...",
        "29... Nxd3 30. h5": "better Qg5, Ne5, Rbb1, Qxc4, Rbc1, Qxd5, Rcd1, and set up some decent defense...",
        "30... Qxc4": "relentless... White has nothing after hxg6, hxg6, Qg5, Qd4, Qf6, Qxd5...",
        "31. hxg6 hxg6": "now what? the White queen has to get to f6, to make any difference... in the meantime Black has the time for Ne5 and Qxd5, all covering f7... it is becoming clear now, that 22. Qh6 was a bad move...",
        "32. Rbxf7": "a desperate attempt; apart from Qg5, Qd4, Qf6, Qxd5, there was nothing left...",
        "32... Rxf7 33. Qxg6+ Rg7 34. Qe6+ Kh8 35. Qf6": "all forced...",
        "35... Qg4": "after this, all is over... so White resigned..."
