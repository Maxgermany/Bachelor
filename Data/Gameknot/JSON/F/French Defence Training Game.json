        "1. e4": "This game was a training match with a teammate of mine.  We both have room for improvement, so welcome any and all comments to help us all improve together.  ",
        "1... e6": "French Defense.  Fairly common response to e4.  Another benefit of the French is that it precludes my favorite, King's Gambit.",
        "2. d4 d5": "All book so far.",
        "3. Nd2": "Protects e4 pawn, provides development of knight, and also allows an eventual c3 push to protect d4.",
        "3... c5": "Great counterattack to the center and provide an obvious recapture point via Bxc5.",
        "4. Ngf3": "Develops and links the remaining knight and provides protection for d4",
        "4... cxd4": "Resolving the center build up.",
        "5. exd5": "Regaining pawn parity and offering some counterplay options and multiple paths for continuation.  ",
        "5... Qxd5": "I think that this play is better than exd5",
        "6. Bc4": "Developing the bishop and threatening the queen.",
        "6... Qd6": "The choices for where to put the queen are more numerous now.  I think Qd6 is the best play.  Another option worth considering is Qc5.  ",
        "7. O-O Nf6": "Prepping for a castle",
        "8. Nb3": "Allowing space for DSB to develop and threatening recapture of d pawn.",
        "8... Nc6": "Natural development and adding some protection to the d4 pawn.",
        "9. Nfxd4": "There is always a consideration of which piece to use for capture when you have multiple options.  Of the two knights I like this one better, because I think it is more likely to cause Black to recapture with the knight.  ",
        "9... Nxd4 10. Nxd4 Be7": "Prepping for the castle",
        "11. c3": "Allowing some more mobility options for the queen.",
        "11... O-O 12. Bg5": "Completing White's development.",
        "12... Qc5": "I might have considered Rd8 or Qc7 here.  Black threatens the bishop prompting action.",
        "13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Bd3": "Adding some options for eventual Qc2 and/or Bh7+.  Note that threat of Bh7+ prevents loss of the c pawn.",
        "14... b6": "I liked Rd8 here better, but the intent is to give the LSB a development spot.",
        "15. Nb3": "Denying the LSB a chance to develop yet.",
        "15... Qc6": "Giving potential for Bb7 to threaten mate.  ",
        "16. Re1": "Threatening Be4 skewer.",
        "16... Rd8": "A small mistake here.  While it does prevent the immediate B4 it does cough up a pawn for free.",
        "17. Qc2 g6": "This move is a blunder.  To save the pawn Black missed the skewer threat.",
        "18. Be4 Rd5": "Best option to prevent outright lose the rook at a8.",
        "19. Bxd5": "A mistake on my part.  Just moved too quickly.  c4 wins the rook.",
        "19... Qxd5 20. Rad1": "Rooks love open files",
        "20... Qc6": "Keeping the potential mate threat alive on the main diagonal.",
        "21. Qe4": "My intent here was to force a queen trade.  I might have opened more options by Nd4 instead.  Although I am up a bishop for a rook (instead of a full rook!) the two bishop advantage can eventually prove problematic in an open board.",
        "21... Qxe4 22. Rxe4 Bb7": "Obvious follow up",
        "23. Re2": "Hoping for a rook battery soon.",
        "23... Rc8": "Perhaps Bd5 to take away the rook file and centralize the bishop.",
        "24. Nd2": "I probably should have played Rd7 instead to allow me to double up rooks on the open file",
        "24... Rd8": "pinning my knight.",
        "25. Rb1": "Ree1 may have been a better play.",
        "25... Bg5 26. Nb3 Ba6 27. Ree1 Kg7 28. Nd4": "Centralizing the knight.",
        "28... Bb7 29. Rbd1 Bd5 30. b3": "Protecting the a pawn and setting up a c-pawn push.",
        "30... Bf6 31. c4 Bb7": "I thought Black would trade here instead.",
        "32. Nb5": "Missed opportunity on my part.\n32.\tNxe6+\tfxe6\n33.\tRxd8\tBxd8\n34.\tRd1\tBxg2\n35.\tRxd8\n\nwould have netted two free pawns and ripped apart Black's pawn structure.",
        "32... Re8 33. Rd7": "Looking for a free pawn instead.",
        "33... Bc6": "Best response.",
        "34. Rxa7 Rd8": "Taking the free file and potentially making it difficult for my rook to escape.",
        "35. Kf1": "To allow my e1 rook to move.",
        "35... Rd2": "Perhaps with an eye towards Bd4 and a chance at perpetual check to force a draw.",
        "36. Nc7": "I looked long and hard at Rxe6 but ultimately opted for this play just in case black decided to play Bd4.  Black has a couple of options here on defense.",
        "36... Bd4": "Blunder for Black.  Best play was Bd7.",
        "37. Nxe6+": "This play will break Black's dual bishop threat and allow some rook action in Black's backyard.",
        "37... Kf6 38. Nxd4 Rxd4 39. Ree7": "Now Black has some ugly choices left.",
        "39... b5": "Threatening Bxb5+ if the c-pawn captures.",
        "40. Rac7": "Prolonging the moment of Rxf7+ and offering some counter-capture options on the Black bishop.",
        "40... Be4": "Not the best play as it locks in Black's remaining rook.",
        "41. Rexf7+ Kg5": "Note that if Black moved his king towards the center bad things could have happened.",
        "42. Rfd7": "I also considered cxb5 instead but felt it more important to get rid of his last remaining rook threat.",
        "42... Rxd7": "I think Bd3+ was a better play.",
        "43. Rxd7 bxc4 44. b4": "I can trade my rook for his pawn and bishop (if not just take the pawn outright) and the protected passed pawns will guarantee a win.  If I retake the pawns are isolated and not as powerful.",
        "44... c3 45. Rc7": "Overall a good game on both sides.  Black made a few mistakes that put him behind early and those compounded over time, but still a strong showing.  Appreciate your comments and rating."
