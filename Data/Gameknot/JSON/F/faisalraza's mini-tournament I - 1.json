        "3. Nc3": "and here it is as expected white keeps in the main lines, so I get to challenge the center with e5",
        "3... e5": "the Ruy Lopez Pirc, in this line the game assumes a structure and development very similar to those occurred on an open game... the Pirc was just a decoy!",
        "4. dxe5": "the more drawish variation, white bets on exchanging queens to get a more comfortable middlegame, with less tactical sharpness...",
        "4... dxe5": "now if Qxd8 Kxd8 and next maybe Bc4 or Bg5, has of now black has equalized, with an easier game than in the corresponding Ruy Lopez...",
        "5. Qxd8+ Kxd8": "Queens off the board and the king in the center wont be hazardous for me...",
        "6. Nf3 Bd6 7. Bc4 Rf8": "preparing Be6 by placing the rook on the future semi-open column, and to keep my king on the center of the boards eyeing both wings...",
        "8. Bg5 Be6 9. Bxe6": "it was this or a shy retreat...",
        "9... fxe6": "and now here it is the open column, I've managed to equalize right on the opening",
        "10. O-O-O h6 11. Bh4": "eventually heading to g3",
        "11... Nc6": "developing",
        "12. h3": "prophylaxis in two ways, preventing Ng4 and opening an escape square for the dark squares bishop ",
        "12... Ke7": "leaves d8 to connect rooks while assuming a defensive role for my weakest pawn e6 and increases control of the d column if the rooks are ever to be exchanged",
        "13. a3 Rad8 14. Rd3 Nd4": "blocks the column in reply to white's threat of doubling the rooks",
        "15. Rhd1 c5": "a6 to follow preventing Nb5 and preparing the b5 push",
        "16. Rd1d2 c4": "with tempo, after a6 and b5 I'll have much more space and white would have a bit cramped position",
        "17. Re3": "only",
        "17... a6": "preparing b5, and preventing Nb5",
        "18. Bg3 Nxf3": "with my pawns and pieces set I choose to exchange a few more pieces to simplify the game, and try to outplay my opponent due to the space advantage and activity of the remaining pieces",
        "19. Rxf3 Nh5 20. Rxf8 Rxf8 21. Bh2": "Nf3",
        "21... Nf4": "inviting the exchange that allows me to undouble my e pawns",
        "22. Bxf4 exf4": "and here it is as planed... the pawns are undoubled... let's try to win this one, Ill keep from pushing e5 for now, leaving an entrance on white's field...",
        "23. f3": "my opponent proposed a draw but i declined, because in this tournament I might need this game's full point, so I might try to force this into a win, easier said than done...",
        "23... h5 24. Ne2": "? this is losing for white",
        "24... Bc5": "threatening Be3 to win the rook to a skewer..., and white on has one of three moves to save the rook: \na) Kb1 of course removes the skewer threat so white can move his rook to d1 (only square for the rook) after Be3...\nb) Rd1 anticipating Be3, moves the rook to the only safe square\nc) Nd4 blocking the access to e3, but even this is lost as will be proved latter on...\n\nany other will lose a quality... even Kd1? removes white's rook only safe square, due to Be3 and the rook will fall next...",
        "25. Nd4": "?! again not the best... but I don't see any exit from losing, just a couple more stuburn variations",
        "25... e5": "forces Nf5+ Rxf5 exf5 Be3 Kd1 Bxd2 Kxd2 Kf6 (the point of Rxf5 to remove the guard) again skewers the rook and wins back the quality",
        "26. Nf5+": "only",
        "26... Rxf5": "! removes the guard on e3",
        "27. exf5": "only",
        "27... Be3": "again the skewer theme on the rook appears, this time even more deadly as white's structure is compromised and there are no other pieces to try some counter-play",
        "28. Kd1": "any other leads to the same result (Kb1?? is even worst), so this is also forced",
        "28... Bxd2 29. Kxd2 Kf6": "and the resulting endgame with a pawn up is easily won for black due to the pawn majority on the king's wing...",
        "30. Kc3 b5": "securing the c pawn, white will need too many tempi to capture a6, the f5 pawn will fall next",
        "31. Kb4": "and white started a run for it.. it's just aa counting exercise...",
        "31... Kxf5": "and white needs two tempi more to promote than me",
        "32. Ka5": "white continues with his unsound plan...",
        "32... e4": "now I'll force fxe4 or get a passed pawn, to get three against two pawns on the king's wing, plus next I'll get two against one and eventually one last passed pawn that walks to promotion untouched... then will queen against two or three pawns with y king on e4 well within the win zone...",
        "33. fxe4+": "forced as stated before...",
        "33... Kxe4": "next after white's Kxa6 I get g5 and after Kxb5 forced to get the king out of the way from white's a pawn I get to play g4",
        "34. Kxa6 g5 35. Kxb5 g4": "now will be hxg4, and hxg4, and I have the before mentioned two pawns against one on the king's wing with an assured march until promotion and a won Q vs 2 or 3 pawns endgame, this game show the importance of an overall endgame strategy and proceed to convert any positional advantage in a won endgame..."
