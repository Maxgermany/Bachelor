        "1. b4": "! nice choice, I've considered it sometimes also as a surprise weapon...",
        "1... Nf6": "also not very common, but the most flexible choice",
        "2. Bb2 g6 3. c4 d6": "prophylaxis against c5 or d4",
        "4. Bxf6": "?! a new move, exchanging his best bishop not the best reply to d6 in my opinion",
        "4... exf6": "from now on I'll manage my reflection time as not to end this game too soon, due to my position in the tournament might get influenced by this result, so I have to extend the game as long as possible, until I get the feeling from other games namely from my main opponent faisalraza but also from nordlicht",
        "5. e3": "to release the light squares bishop",
        "5... Bg7": "as intended after 2...g6",
        "6. Nf3 c5": "a challenger to white's advanced b and c pawns",
        "7. bxc5 dxc5": "and the c pawn had done it's job, white does have a center pawn majority, but his queen side knight can't move to c3 without the risk of being taken disrupting the pawn structure, and doubling pawns on the c column",
        "8. Nc3 Nc6": "still developing not to be let down behind in development, still I threat f5 hitting the c3 knight with my bishop",
        "9. Be2 O-O 10. Qa4 f5": "and now white must defend the c knight, or allow me to double his pawns",
        "11. Rb1": "?! I don't see the point, it seams to just lose one tempo",
        "11... Bxc3": "gives up the bishop pair to disturb white's pawn center and double his pawns on the c column giving him three pawn islands that might be hard to defend in the middlegame/endgame",
        "12. dxc3 Re8": "with the idea of playing f4 if white decides to play 0-0",
        "13. Rb2 Qa5": "offers the exchange of queens based on the superior middle/endgame",
        "14. Qxa5 Nxa5 15. Nd2 Be6": "immediately attacking one of white's weak pawns",
        "16. Nb3": "and we will enter a technical B + 2 R vs N + 2 R endgame, in the long run I hope my bishop will prove more effective, for that I'll need to keep pawns on both wings and exchange rooks...",
        "16... Nxc4": "for a while white can't bring the other rook in to the game, so I must use all my pieces to secure a more decisive advantage",
        "17. Bxc4": "? bad as it allows me some tactics based on the pin on e3",
        "17... Bxc4 18. Nxc5 b6 19. Nb3": "and now due to the pin on the e pawn I can push f4 to profit from the pin on e3",
        "19... f4": "now I have a probable win, I managed to exchange my doubled pawn creating another isolated/potentially weak pawn for white, he has 4 pawn islands to defend I have only two, he has a knight I have a bishop... a lot to work for still... The strategy nos is to simplify to a bishop and rook against knight and rook (or eventually  a even better Bishop vs knight) with pawns on both wings and exert the bishop supremacy on the endgame",
        "20. Kd2 fxe3+": "and I achieved to improve even further my position",
        "21. fxe3 Re5": "upgrading my rooks position bringing them to the 5th rank",
        "22. Nd4 Rae8": "now i start a battle of tempi...",
        "23. Re1": "forced to defend the pawn white wastes one tempo",
        "23... Ra5": "hitting another pawn to prepare Rh5",
        "24. Ra1": "this was not forced...",
        "24... Rh5": "but here it is",
        "25. h3": "weakening the pawn structure",
        "25... Ree5": "and now connecting both rooks on the 5th",
        "26. Rd1 Bd5": "moving the bishop to the main diagonal h1-a8 as the g pawn is tied to the defense of h3 white needs Rg1",
        "27. Rg1": "forced",
        "27... Reg5": "with the idea of Rxh3 winning a pawn",
        "28. Kd3 Rxh3": "here it is",
        "29. c4": "forcing me to choose from Bb7 and Ba8, but due to the threat c5 I prefer Ba8",
        "29... Ba8 30. Nb5 Rhg3": "the threat now is Bxg2",
        "31. Nxa7 Bxg2": "the idea now is a discovered attack on the rook with Be4, winning me a quality, so white should move it",
        "32. Re1 h5": "now my king side pawns will prove their value as I'll push them to promotion",
        "33. Nc8 h4 34. Rxb6 h3 35. Rb8 h2": "winning a rook even if white gives check",
        "36. Nd6+": "as expected",
        "36... Kg7": "now I have two alternative plans either Rxe3 to force the promotion or h1 to win a rook depending on white's move",
