Its been over 2 years since I played the game, I remember it been a real sucker punch so I thought I'd try to annotate it and recap some of my thinking! \r\nEven worse is the fact this match was for records, if I won I got \u00a330 worth of records if I lost then I had to give him \u00a310 of records, as well as the others in the RR!!",
