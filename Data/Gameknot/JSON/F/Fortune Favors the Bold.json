    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "This is a game I played well against a similar opponent and lost anyway.  At one point in the game, I was up by 7 points, but my opponent's bold attack won the game.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4": "Some players prefer developing defensive positions, while others prefer assertive openings that disrupt defensive pieces.  With this move, I guessed early on that my opponent likes hawkish tactics, but only found out later his preference for nervy moves.",
        "3... exd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c3 Bg7": "Not a bad opening so far for either side.  Each player is two moves away from castling - and can launch offensive strategies easily.",
        "6. Bc4 Nf6": "The knight moves out of the way to allow for castling.",
        "7. Qf3": "This player is not shy about bringing out the big pieces early.",
        "7... O-O 8. Bg5": "Good move.  The white bishop pins the knight to the black queen.  If the black queen moves off the diagonal, then only the black bishop protects the knight against two white assailants.",
        "8... c5": "The black pawn pressures the white knight to retreat.",
        "9. Ne2 Nc6": "Move knight forward with the intent of going to e5 and forking white's queen and bishop.",
        "10. h3 Ne5": "The fork is in place.  Neither the queen nor bishop can safely move to protect the other.",
        "11. Bxf7+": "If you are going to lose the bishop, might as well take out a pawn and put the opponent in check.",
        "11... Rxf7": "I could have taken with the e5 knight, but I wanted to keep that fixed on white's queen.  In retrospect, I wish I took with the knight so it could pressure white's bishop to get off the g5 square.",
        "12. Qg3 Nc4 13. Na3": "Should black go for the knight exchange or take the free pawn on b2?",
        "13... Nxb2": "One free pawn!  If white moves Rb1, the knight can retreat to a4 and thence to b6.",
        "14. Nb5": "With both a queen and knight aimed at the pawn on d6, and with only the black queen for support, black can take out that pawn.",
        "14... Rd7": "So the rook provides more support to the pawn.  Unfortunately, the rook also traps black's light-square bishop.",
        "15. O-O": "There is a rule that says \"Never launch a major offensive before castling.\"  By this far into the game and with nothing threatening the white king, castling looks like an afterthought.",
        "15... Nc4": "Time to move this knight back into action.",
        "16. Nf4 a6": "Seeing how white's b5 knight has no safe square, I think I can pick it off with minimal loss.",
        "17. Ne6": "Good move!  Instead of trying to defend the b5 knight, white responds with a threat to my queen!  Best defense is a good offense.",
        "17... Qe8": "From here, white could have gone: 18. Ne6c7 Rxc7 19. Nxc7 Qf8 Nxa8.  For the cost of 1 knight, white could have captured two rooks.  Or it could have gone 18. Ne6c7 Qf8 19. Nxa8 axb5 and white would have ended up exchanging a rook for a knight.  As tempting as these options were, white had other plans.",
        "18. Nxg7": "I was surprised white took a lower value target rather than trying to pick off a rook or two.",
        "18... Kxg7 19. Rae1": "I was puzzled by this move at first since white is leaving the unprotected.  I assumed that white just wrote off this knight as a lost piece not worth defending anymore.  In hindsight, I see it was a good move since two rooks side by side providing support for two pawns side by side is a really effective tactic.  I've seen pawns and rooks working together like that to clear the file of opposing pieces or walk all the way to the last row.",
        "19... axb5": "I take out the knight and am up by 6 points.",
        "20. e5": "Despite being down by two minor pieces, white makes another daring move.  The e5 pawn has put itself under attack by 3 black pieces even though it is protected by only two white pieces - two very valuable white pieces.  I first considered this move somewhat foolhardy.",
        "20... Nxe5": "Now I am up by 7 points but in a riskier position.",
        "21. f4": "Here, white pressures the knight into moving.  If the knight evades the pawn, then rook will take the unprotected queen for free.",
        "21... Re7": "The rook intervenes to protect the queen.",
        "22. fxe5": "Now white's real plans are clear.  Black's remaining knight is attacked by 3 white pieces.  The white bishop can take the knight with impunity and threaten both king and rook.  Once the king moves to safety, the rook is dead.",
        "22... dxe5": "This can remove a pawn threat, but does nothing to alleviate the pressure on the knight.",
        "23. Bxf6+ Kg8 24. Bxe7 Qxe7 25. Rxe5 Qg7 26. Re8+": "By now, the end game is in sight.  Black has one legal move - to sacrifice the queen.  Her death will not remove any white pieces, but only provide the king with a temporary escape.",
        "26... Qf8 27. Rfxf8+": "By now, the end is inevitable.  The king can only evade white's pieces for a few moves at best.",
        "27... Kg7 28. Rfg8+ Kh6 29. Qh4#": "My opponent has earned a well-deserved win.  My opponent used all his pieces to good effect - even though he was down in material by mid-game.  My two remaining pieces were never developed and contributed very little to their king's defense by the end game, so we were effectively evenly matched in pieces on the king side of the board."
