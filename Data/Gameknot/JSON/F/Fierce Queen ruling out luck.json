        "1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Nge2 a6 5. Bg2 e6 6. d3 Ne7 7. Be3 d6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bh6 d5": "just playing the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian, like I did a million times before; equalizing is Bxh6, Qxh6, but I had other plans...",
        "10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. exd5 exd5 12. O-O": "White had a lot of chances for playing d4, and dissolve c5; this might well be the last one... but I was not ready for d4, yet...",
        "12... b5": "at this point, I had no idea where this would take me: I just had to place the pawn there, as if my hand had been drawn to it; was this my imagination kicking in? of course, after this I could never play d4, without at least Nbc6 or something like that, due to Ra8... this strange move mainly rules out Na4, after d4, with an attack on c5; so in a way, we are forcing Nf4 to free up a possible Nc3-e2; apart from d4 somewhere in the future, b4 is still a threat...",
        "13. Nf4": "like clockwork...",
        "13... Be6": "forced for both; d4 will not work now, due to Ra8 hanging there...",
        "14. Rae1": "still, d4 would have been better; but now things are getting tense... to avoid serious trouble at e6, Blacks' best option is Qd6... after 15. Qe2 Nbc6, 16. Nxe6 fxe6, 17. Qxe6 Rf6, things are fairly under control with minor advantage for White... in stead, Black weaves a deep and dangerous - but thematic - trap involving gambit pawn c5, in this closed Sicilian game; taking an enduring (for now) disadvantage...",
        "14... Ra7": "avoiding Nbc6 (covering Ne7, but hindering our plans), followed by Rc8, which would make our plan too obvious: taking over the c-file, after d4, cxd4 (or even allowing dxc5, winning a tempo), with Rc7 or Rc8 under cover of the Queen; thematic in any Sicilian... on a higher plain, this strange looking move also makes d5-d4 possible since d5 is unpinned, plus it covers for Ne7; very important here - as jkarp explained in his comment... but there is more, than meets the eye; we are luring Whites' pieces into our position, and drawing Whites' attention away from d4: just the kind of move, Tal - whom I deeply admire - would have come up with...",
        "15. Nxe6+": "and the cheap magic worked for now; had White played Rxe6 (fxe6??, Nxe6+ with loss of the Queen), Black would have simply lost a piece with virtually (mind you: there is more where this came from, and this is far from over) no compensation... White just got too greedy: all in the game, and all that...",
        "15... fxe6 16. Rxe6 Nbc6": "objectively stronger was Qd7, Rfe1, Nbc6; but I was still working on my trap, so I needed more time... this simple reversing the order of moves however, would set White on the wrong foot for a while... all other options - b4, Ne2, Qd7, Nf4 or Qd7, Rfe1, Nbc6, d4 - are only favoring Whites' play; a direct d4 would only induce Ne4, attacking c5...",
        "17. Rfe1": "this is sloppy again... after Nxd5 (Nxd5?, Rxc6, and c5 is surely lost), Nd4, Nxe7, Rxe7, Rxa6, things are starting to look grim for Black with three pawns behind...\n",
        "17... d4": "finally: here, Blacks' plans are coming together......",
        "18. Rxc6": "taking on c6 is practically forced and best, but again White misses the (probably) winning continuation: Bxc6, Nxc6, Rxc6, dxc3, Qxc3+, Qd4, Qxc5!, leaving no other option than trading Queens, and White is clearly better with a massive force of pawns at the Q's side... it all evolves around c5: that magnetic gambit pawn in any Sicilian; play like this, learned me that 1. e4 c5, is indeed a true gambit... that pawn screams to be conquered; only few dare and succeed...",
        "18... Nxc6 19. Bxc6 dxc3 20. Qxc3+ Qf6": "the position is dead and drawing, after Qd4, Re4, Qxc3, bxc3, Kf6, a4!, so Black again tries to make complications with his first Queens' move in this game; which looks more intimidating than it really is, because we voluntary choose a pin on the Queen... but obviously, after something like Kh6, Bc6 is running into trouble, and also f2... so White tries to make things easy for himself; falling right into the trap, I set up a while ago: taking the c-file with some Rook, and enter somewhere on the second row... thematic play for Black in any Sicilian, where c5 is supposed to be a gambit pawn; look it up for yourselves...\n",
        "21. Qxc5": "and snap, said the trap: which all started at Ra7, now working as a magnet for what seems to be a winning attack; unfortunately, Qxc5 is not working anymore: c5 has become a poisoned pawn... can we call this blindness in chess, which occasionally happens to all stronger players? or was White too eager to make up for all the chances he missed? we will never know... simply Qe5 (pinning Blacks' Queen again), Qxe5 (Rf7, f4!), Rxe5, would at least have held some advantage with two pawns ahead...",
        "21... Raf7": "the last bluff, and again reversing the attention from the real problem; of course, after 21. ... Rc7, 22. c3 (what else?), Rxc6, 22. Qe7+ Rf7, 23. Qxf6+ Rcxf6, f4, g5, all is over for White with a Rook behind, but for some reason, White missed that... Black is obviously attacking Whites' second row of pawns now, after Qxf2+, Qxf2, Rxf2, etc... White has several options now, of which most - of course - involve moving Bc6, or at least pinning Qf6 with Qc3 or Qe5... White however, wants to rule out Blacks' new threat on f2...",
        "22. f4": "a terrible move; best was Be4 (or maybe Bd5), Qxf2+, Qxf2, Rxf2, d4, Rd2, Bd3, Rff2, Re7+, Kh6, with a decent edge for Black... but not more than that; White still has a lot of pawns to be neutralized...",
        "22... Rc8": "reversing the problem back into reality; and again, White has no better than c3, Rxc6, Qe5, b4!, cxb4, Rc2, clearing Whites' pawns... Black has the best of both worlds now, so White has to resign although at least two pawns ahead... the clocks were at 4:38 for Black and 3:26 for White; I still felt not lucky: I felt like a cheap magician, with too many tricks up his sleeve... Tal would have just played 21. ... Rc7, and mock at Bobby..."
