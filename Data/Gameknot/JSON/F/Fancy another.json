        "1. e4": "My most recent game against Raziel.  He's down 2-1 so has extra incentive to win",
        "1... e5": "A departure from my usual reply of g3 - I thought i'd give the hypermodern opening a rest in favour of a more traditional position.",
        "2. Nf3 d6": "Defending the e-pawn.  First mistake - this move blocks my black square bishop.  ",
        "3. Bc4": "Raziell threatens my f-pawn with a potential Ng5 ",
        "3... Nf6 4. d3 Nc6 5. Bg5": "Raz seems content to develop more pieces rather than go for the f-pawn.",
        "5... Be7": "Preparing to repel his bishop",
        "6. Nc3": "All Raz's minor pieces now in play.",
        "6... O-O 7. O-O Bg4": "An (almost) symmetrical board.  Who will be first to make an exchange?",
        "8. a3 Nd4": "Putting some pressure on Raz's pinned knight.  Also aiming to disrupt his kingside pawns.",
        "9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. h3": "Raz's first mistake.  Moving his h-pawn creates a weakness in his king's defences.",
        "10... Bxf3 11. gxf3": "Now his castle has a gaping breech.  This will be my focus of attack from now on.",
        "11... Bh4 12. Nd5 c6 13. Ne3 Qg5+": "With his king trapped in the corner, my problem is how find mate in this situation.  ",
        "14. Kh1 Qf4 15. Ng2 Qh6 16. c3 Ne6": "Here I intended to play Nf4 to remove his knight.  However...",
        "17. Bxe6 Qxe6": "My next Big Mistake.  Should have taken the bishop with fe3, freeing up the rook.  ",
        "18. f4 Qxh3+ 19. Kg1 f5": "Here I am belatedly trying to bring the rook into play.  Would have done better at this point to withdraw the bishop to e2,  or take the f4 pawn with ef4 and threaten f3.",
        "20. Qh5": "Raziell freely admitted this was a blunder (which I missed).  Bf7 would cost him his queen, but unfortunately I seem to be playing with my eyes shut.",
        "20... fxe4": "Still focused on bringing that rook out...",
        "21. Qxh4": "Queen under attack now, I decide to start removing his pawns.",
        "21... Qxd3 22. Rfd1 Qf3 23. Kf1": "Now intent on creating a passed pawn (or two), I don't see Raz's next surprise...",
        "23... exf4 24. Ne1": "Wave goodbye to the queen, all I can do here is mitigate the disaster.",
        "24... Qxd1 25. Rxd1 d5": "Now my focus is on advancing my pawns with a view to promoting, or at least putting pressure on Raz's king",
        "26. Qe7 Rae8": "Lining up my rooks behind the f and e pawns ready to push forward, I'm prepared to let my b-pawn go.",
        "27. Qxb7 f3 28. Nc2": "ee3 at this point could be met by ne3, so time to dislodge that knight",
        "28... Reb8 29. Qxa7 Rxb2 30. Ne3": "Raz's knight blocks e-pawns advance, but his king is now in a potentially dangerous position.  If I can get my other rook to h1, mate!",
        "30... h6": "First give my king a bolt-hole",
        "31. Qd7": "Raz is set to eat my pawn chain from the base up.   Fair enough, he can occupy himself with that while I get my rook in position",
        "31... Rf4 32. Nf5": "Raz now threatens mate with Qg7.  Only one option left",
        "32... Rg4": "This could be met by Ng3 , giving Raz the rook.",
        "33. Qe8+ Kh7 34. Ne7": "I am tantalizingly close to a decisive attack on Raz's king with Rg2 followed by Rf2 - unfortunately I have a potential mate to deal with on Qg2, so here comes my last attempt to avoid mate.  I should have resigned at this point, it's already too late.",
        "34... h5 35. Qxh5#": "Raziell equalizes 2-2!  Honestly, I don't play like that all the time."
