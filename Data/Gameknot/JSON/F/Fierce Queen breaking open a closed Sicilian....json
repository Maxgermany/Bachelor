    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5 2. Nc3": "steering at the closed Sicilian rightaway: in time, I learned to respect this move; the only option, seems to be d6...",
        "2... d6 3. f4": "at this point, I was already sensing that White was mixing up two different systems: obviously preparing Nf3, but Blacks' next set of moves will neutralize Whites' play...",
        "3... Nc6 4. Nf3 a6": "I practice this more often: after Nf6, Bb5, a6; so we play a6, and reverse reality...",
        "5. a4": "for some reason, White wants to prevent b5: but we just want Nf6, without Bb5; tempo won...",
        "5... Nf6 6. Bc4 e6 7. d3 d5": "just natural development for Black: but somehow, White observed an elephant in the room; after Ba2, dxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4, dxe4, Qxd1+, Kxd1, b5 (of course not axb5, axb5: Ba2 is in the way), Ke2! (preparing c3), Black has only a slight advantage, or maybe none...",
        "8. e5": "already underestimating the gravity of the situation...",
        "8... dxc4 9. exf6 cxd3 10. fxg7 Bxg7 11. cxd3": "so far, so good: Black has reached the ideal outcome in this Sicilian: but White produces another mistake; after Qxd3, Qxd3, cxd3, b6 (Nb4, Ke2, is useless), Ne4, Ke7, White can just hope to hold this...",
        "11... Nb4": "simple, yet very effective...",
        "12. Be3": "although Be3 is a thematic move in Whites' opening play in the Sicilian after f4, any game needs a losing move somewhere: this is the one in this game; whatever White is planning, 0-0, Qxd3, a5, was the least White had to do...",
        "12... Nxd3+": "no second thoughts: this will tear up Whites' position...",
        "13. Ke2": "safer is Kf1, Bd7, Qc2 (Qxd3, Bb5!)...",
        "13... c4": "relentless...",
        "14. Qc2": "somewhat countering the threat Nxb2, to be followed by Qd3+; Ne1, e5 (opening up the diagonal for Bc8), Qd2, was better...",
        "14... Rg8": "way stronger than Nxb2 (Qxb2, Qd3+, Kf2, Bxc3)...",
        "15. g3": "understandably: Rxg2 is not something we want, after an eventual Bxc3; but this weakens Whites' position further: this move was needed at move 3...",
        "15... e5": "an inspired - albeit temporary - pawn sacrifice, but not too hard to find: we can now develop Bc8 to dangerous places, and also Bg7 comes into action; a good example of the strength of the combined Bishop pair...",
        "16. fxe5": "of course, exf4 is not much of an option, and also Bf5 is becoming a problem followed by Nf4+, losing the Queen: also very unpleasant is Nxe5, Bxe5, fxe5, Bg4+, Kf1, Qd7...",
        "16... Bg4": "main threat being of course Bxf3, Kxf3, Qd7, and maybe even castling long in a not too distant future; another threat is recapturing e5: with a nasty vengeance...",
        "17. Rad1": "or Rhf1, upon which I had contemplated Qa5 and put even more pressure on e5: e5 is going nowhere...",
        "17... Bxf3+": "I liked this better than Bxe5, Rhf1, Bxc3, Qxc3, Qd5, Rxd3, cxd3, Qxd3; this will bring Whites' King out of protection...",
        "18. Kxf3 Qd7": "also here, Bxe5 can wait: White has work to do on defending; Black is threatening Qc6+: best for now is Kg2, Qc6+, Kg1, Bxe5, Qg2, Qxg2+, Kxg2, Nxb2, Rc1, Nd3, Rc2...",
        "19. Ne4": "creating new complications, after Blacks' next move...",
        "19... Bxe5": "suddenly, Qg4+ is a very dangerous threat...",
        "20. Nf2": "so this is pretty much forced: i.e. after Qxc4??, Qg4+, Kg2, Qe2+, Nf2, Ne1+, and White loses the Queen; also Qf5+, again to be followed by Nf4+, needs to be countered...",
        "20... Qc6+": "I liked this better, than Qd5+: now, Nd3 is unpinned also; next to covering for c4...",
        "21. Ke2 Nxb2": "snatching off, a second pawn: Whites' position is about to fall apart...",
        "22. Qf5": "probably the only one, in preventing Black from castling long anymore, even after Nxd1: Black is piling up too many threats; this forces trading Queens...",
        "22... Qe6 23. Qxe6+ fxe6 24. Rda1": "practically forced...",
        "24... Rd8": "developing the last piece, and taking over the open d-file: there is not much point in castling long anymore; the Black King is better prepared for this endgame, in the center...",
        "25. Ne4 Rg4 26. Nf2 Rg7 27. Ne4 Rd5 28. Rhf1": "Black is relocating pieces: at this point, White might have considered Ra2, Rc7, Bb6!, Rc6, a5, or directly a5...",
        "28... Nd3": "winning a tempo: White has to play Ra2, Rc7, Bb6, Rc6, a5, or Ra3, Rc7, a5...",
        "29. Rab1": "this is not good: this will connect Blacks' extra and soon passed pawns...",
        "29... b5": "for the record: after a5, this would have never been possible, due to axb6 en passant; maybe Black would still be winning, but it had been much harder: now, after axb5, axb5, White has some tough decisions to make...",
        "30. axb5 axb5 31. Bd2": "probably, the toughest defense...",
        "31... Ra7": "of course, heading for a2, preparing b4; best now, is Rf6, Ra2 (Bxf6?, Nxf6+, Ke7, Nxd5+, exd5, Rxb5), Rxe6+, Kd7, Rb6, b4 (or Rd4, Kf3), Kf3...",
        "32. Rf7": "I have to assume, that White meant to play Rf6 here: of course, this loses everything after Kxf7; so White resigned on the spot..."
