        "5. c3": "for now, this bluff worked really nicely: after just Nc3, Nc6, Qg3, or Qg3, Nc6, Nc3, White is already better...",
        "5... Qxf3": "certainly, not the best of continuations: after Nc6, Bf4, a6, Nd2, d6, 0-0-0, Black has a lot of sins to contemplate...",
        "6. Nxf3 Bg7": "at this point, Black should really consider Ne7, Bg5, Bg7: but we are on a mission; Ne7 will come in due time, and after Bg5 I usually plan f6...",
        "7. Ng5": "luckily, not the best move for White: some players, still think that this motif works in some way; however, after Ne7, followed by d5, this dream is over... better here, is Bf4, Ne7, Bd6!, Nbc6, 0-0, b6, and take it from there...",
        "7... Ne7 8. Na3": "admitting, 5. c3, was a bad move; we have to be careful now, because White is preparing Nb5 threatening both Nc7 (losing Ra8) or Nd6 possibly with check; castling is no option, due to Nc7...",
        "8... a6": "forced, but always sound in most Sicilian play: the good old Najdorf extension; both b5 and d5, are now issues...",
        "9. b4": "after just Bb3/Bf4, d5, Bf4/Bb3, or 0-0, d5, or Be3, d5 - or virtually any move, followed by d5 - there was not much happening: this all is just just Sicilian development; this move however, can only happen in blitz...",
        "9... cxb4": "at this point, I realized that cxb4 would result in Bxa1: totally missing, that Bxc3+ is already winning; this too, is not uncommon in blitz games: totally missing the winning move......",
        "10. Nc2": "Nb1, bxc3, Na3, c2, Nxc2, could have saved a lot: although d5, is still very winning...",
        "10... Bxc3+": "luckily, finally Black - that would be moi - has woken up: so has White, and resigns immediately..."
