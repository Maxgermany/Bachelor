        "2. d4": "d4 to open up his black bishop",
        "2... b6": "This is a very dangerous move, but it may turn the tide your way if used correctly, for if diagonal squares remain open and white's bishop is out, you pretty much get free rook.",
        "3. e5": "He just did a favor to me by moving that out of the way.",
        "3... Bb7": "In here, if he takes out his white bishop as I mentioned, I can attack g2 and take the free rook.",
