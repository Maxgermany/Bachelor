        "1. e4": "This is a fascinating win against one of the leaders of the fast ladder: my 20th game against him.  I'd achieved no wins and only 4 draws previously, so this is rather sweet.  It also represents a success for my Caro-Kann Advance Variation, in which I've been having a theoretical struggle against a number of players recently, few of whom have cooperated as much as my OTB opponent, Nathan Manley.",
        "1... c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5": "Probably the best response to the Advance, though it's counter-intuitive, moving the pawn a second time.",
        "4. dxc5": "As recommended by all the resources.",
        "4... Nc6": "Black uses the square vacated by the pawn to attack White's advanced pawn.",
        "5. Bb5": "So White pins the knight.  According to Kotronias in his book \"Beating the Caro-Kann\", this was recommended by Boleslavsky.  The game is already assuming a completely different character from the 3...Bf5 variations.",
        "5... e6": "Black lives with the pin, counter-attacking White's surplus pawn.  The game is already very cut and thrust - and out of Kotronias's book, which only gives 5...Qa5+",
        "6. Be3 Nge7 7. Nf3": "Both sides develop their pieces according to the tactical demands.",
        "7... Nf5": "Black simultaneously resumes the attack on c5 with an attack on its main defender at e3.  This position is identical with one given in Kotronias's book except that Black hasn't played ...Qa5+ with White responding Nc3.  The game veers sharply into unknown territory hereafter.",
        "8. Qd2 Nxe3": "Black seizes the opportunity to gain the advantage of the bishop pair, though both his prelates are still at home.  You'll see later how advantageous they are though!",
        "9. Qxe3 Qa5+": "A classic disruptive check, forking King and Bishop, while developing Black's own Queen.",
        "10. Nc3": "White meets it with a normal developing move.",
        "10... a6 11. Bxc6+": "White gives up his other Bishop to avoid loss of tempo and hoping that the pawn structure (including an isolated Black a-pawn) will favour the Knights as much as Black's Bishops.",
        "11... bxc6 12. O-O": "White returns the pawn for a more secure King and a developed Rook.",
        "12... Bxc5 13. Qg5": "This move was aimed not so much in expectation of winning any material as inducing a pawn weakness on Black's kingside.",
        "13... O-O": "Black merely castles...",
        "14. a3": "White threatens to fork from b4",
        "14... Qc7 15. Rae1": "Over-defending the e-pawn gives White's other defending pieces (N and Q) more options.  The Ra1 was chosen for this purpose rather than the Rf1 because that R had responsibility for defending f2.  White now has to guard against Black preparing and playing ...Ba6, winning the exchange of the immobile Rf1.",
        "15... Rb8": "Black seizes the half-open b-file, threatening to win a pawn.",
        "16. b4": "...which counter-attacks",
        "16... Ba7": "Black keeps the B on the key diagonal a7-g1, aiming at White's King.  The alternative was to retreat to e7, threatening White's Q.",
        "17. Kh1": "A prophylactic move, shifting the K off the Black Bishop's diagonal.",
        "17... c5": "Black exploits his Queenside power base to launch a natural-looking attack.",
        "18. Na2": "White retreats the QN to defend the b-pawn and also evade several potential attacks.",
        "18... Bb7": "Now Black's two bishops exert inexorable pressure across the board for most of the rest of the game.  Who, in this position, wouldn't prefer Black?",
        "19. c3": "Another waiting move from White, not exactly non-committal, as it shuts his QN in to a life of misery if Black is similarly inactive.  White's problem was finding something constructive at this point.",
        "19... d4": "Black seizes the opportunity to advance to d4, threatening to create a dangerous passed pawn and opening the white diagonal.",
        "20. cxd4 cxd4": "Black has his passed pawn and the lines are opening nicely in his favour.",
        "21. Nc1": "The N's work on a2 was done and it was time to improve White's worst piece while inhibiting the passed pawn.",
        "21... Qc3": "Black uses the opportunity to attack White's weak queenside pawns with his Q, while also supporting the passed pawn's advance.",
        "22. Nh4": "White seeks an illusory counter-attack, easily seen off by Black.",
        "22... d3 23. Red1": "White couldn't allow the fork from d2.",
        "23... Rbd8 24. Qg3": "Gradually everything focuses on the pawn on d3.",
        "24... Qxa3": "Black avoids over-committing to d3's defence, instead snaffling the a-pawn and threatening b4.",
        "25. Nxd3": "White's recapture defends b4 as well.",
        "25... Rd5": "Now Black advances his R, threatening to double, but also setting up threats to e5 and maintaining the pressure on d3 and d1.",
        "26. f4": "This move has both defensive and attacking potential...",
        "26... Rfd8 27. Rf3": "White \"threatens\" a discovered attack on the Q on a3 but while the Rd1 is undefended it is no threat at all.  The next few moves are all variations on the mutual dependencies of these key squares and pieces.",
        "27... Qxb4": "White's N is not really defending this pawn because of the pin against d1.",
        "28. h3": "White has to defend against the potential back row mate.",
        "28... Qb6": "This was slightly mysterious to me ... but you can see the potential against d1, g1 and g2 if White is careless.",
        "29. f5": "White resumes his hopeful attack.",
        "29... Rd5d4": "This reveals an attack by the Bb7 on the Rf3, potentially overloading White's Q.",
        "30. f6": "Now White has virtually his first threat of the game: mate on g7.",
        "30... g6": "Which, of course, is easily prevented.",
        "31. Rff1": "Now White has to attend once more to defensive duties and the hitherto undefended Rd1.",
        "31... Rd8d5": "This move adds to the pressure, reducing White's available moves without making any specific threats.",
        "32. Nf2": "The N's retreat removes the focus from d3 and maintains defence of d1, while allowing the N the potential of moving via g4 to h6, delivering check and threatening f7.  It also makes itself a potential target for the Q and B on b6 and a7...",
        "32... Rd4xd1 33. Nxd1": "Forced.  33. Rxd1 would have lost a piece after 33....Qxf2.",
        "33... Bb8": "Black builds pressure on e5, the base of White's little chain.",
        "34. Nf3": "So White recentralises a N and defends e5.",
        "34... Qd8": "Black attacks d1 again.",
        "35. Ne3": "So the N advances, counter-attacking the Rd5 and setting up potential mischief on f5 or via c4 and d6.",
        "35... Rd3": "and Black immediately attacks the undefended N, skewering it and its brother against White's Q.  The skewer need not become a major problem but White has to make sure, every move, that it doesn't.",
        "36. Re1 a5": "Black's trump card advances.  This became a passed pawn on move 27 and has remained dormant throughout the manoeuvring since then.",
        "37. Qg5": "Rather than succumb to passive defence, White seeks to create a mating threat, even though it appears to be easily defensible for Black.",
        "37... Bxf3": "Black snaffles one of White's potential attackers, further weakening White's K's defences as well.  Was the B worth more than the N though?",
        "38. gxf3 Qf8": "Black neutralises the threat of Qh6 but perhaps this could have been delayed till White was committed?",
        "39. f4": "The doubled pawn is just another desperado to be thrown at Black's fortress.",
        "39... h6 40. Qg2": "White retreats to a carefully chosen square, which is white, thus avoiding any attack by Black's Bishop, and preventing any untoward checks by Black's Q on the long diagonal, while also potentially exploiting Black's a8 square for a surprise check and covering the square a2 in case the remote passed pawn advances.  Compare these advantages against the Q's other options and this looks like a good move.",
        "40... Ba7": "Now the Nf3 is attacked twice.  Defend or move?",
        "41. Nc4": "Counter-attack!",
        "41... Rc3 42. Nd6": "At the time, I thought that Black's last move made taking the a5 pawn too dangerous, so I made for this outpost instead.  Maybe I could have taken on a5?  Whatever, I liked this move.",
        "42... Qb8": "Black's Q returns to the wide open spaces.  I feared the worst.",
        "43. f5": "but I spotted this opportunity at last to exploit the pin of the g-pawn.  Black can only capture with the e-pawn, when my recapture with the N threatens the h6 pawn and the e and f pawns become real thorns in Black's position.  So Black probably can't capture, allowing White to take on g6 and then break through with the Q.  For the first time in a long time, I felt some glimmer of hope.",
        "43... Qb3": "What's this?  Uh-oh!  White threatens Rxh3+ followed by at least winning White's Q or at worst delivering mate (note that Ba7!).  White has one nuisance check...",
        "44. Qa8+ Kh7 45. fxg6+": "and another... ",
        "45... Kxg6": "with which my gracious opponent advised me that at last I had beaten him; but he didn't resign, so I cast around frantically to make sure I didn't miss the winning move and played...",
        "46. Qg8+": "and he resigned, since 46....Kh5 is followed by 47. Qg4#.  I felt that this was a lucky win on my behalf but at least I'd earned it by staying in the game in the face of many subtle threats.  Black had been winning since about move 20."
