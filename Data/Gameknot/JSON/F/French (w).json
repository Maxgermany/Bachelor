        "10. Nh4": "Knight on the h file is generally considered as bad but it attacks the LSB which has few squares available.",

        "18... a6": "Preparing b5. I do not like the position : material is equal, white controls the open file but black's knight prevent movement, White's pawn structure is slighly better, the kings are safe. The center is contested but white has far less possibilities of action, particularly on the queenside. The main problem is the powerfull blak knight on e5.",

Rh6 menacing mate by 31. Qh7 Black plays 30. ... Qg7 31. Qe6+  and the black queen will be lost.\n\nSo that black has to give perpetual chess to draw.\n\nHe still has 2 way to win : fork attack between the white king and the g rook and mate, using his f rook if the white king comes on the e file. \n\nBoth players have to be very carefull.",
