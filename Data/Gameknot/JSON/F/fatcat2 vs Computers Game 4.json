        "1... d5 2. c4 c6": "Fritz chooses the Slav Defence. I have little experience of this opening, but I think I can wing it somehow...",
        "3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4": "I think this transposes into Queen's Gambit Accepted territory. Much more comfortable for me.",
        "5. e4 b5 6. a4": "The classic move to undermine Black's queenside pawn structure in the QGA.",
        "6... b4": "Bypassing my a-pawn, Fritz is squashing my queenside with his b- and c-pawns.",
        "7. e5": "I realised that this loses me a pawn. But it was the best way to keep my queenside open.",
        "7... bxc3 8. exf6 cxb2 9. Bxb2 exf6 10. Bxc4 Bb4+ 11. Nd2 Qe7+ 12. Qe2": "Fritz demonstrates his tactical skill. He likes to have all my pieces nicely pinned to my king.",

        "19. Rde1 Nxb2 20. Re6e7+": "Another blunder...don't ask...",
        "20... Bxe7": "And I resigned. Behind by a rook, a bishop and a passed pawn - how could this position get any worse!?\r\n\r\nAnyway, after my shocking performance against Unleashed Fritz 10, at least I retain a slim lead over the Computers - the scores as they stand are 2.5 to fatcat2, 1.5 to the Computers.\r\n\r\nI have learned from my mistakes. Never again will I muck up in this horrific way, against a computer or a human. And never again will I pile the brandy cream so high on the Christmas pudding..."
