        "1. e4 e6": "after a hard fought loss in our previous game (see elsewhere in the annotations), the Black player  wanted another shot at me in French Defense...",
        "2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 a6": "diverting from our previous game, where Qb6 was played; theory continues with Nc6, Nf3, Qb6...",
        "5. Nf3 Bd7 6. Be3 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Ne7": "better Nc6, Nxc6, bxc6, b3, Qc7, f4, Nh6...",
        "8. f4": "winning an important tempo for White...",
        "8... Nbc6 9. Bd3 g5 10. Nxc6 Nxc6 11. Nd2": "I did not trust Qh5, gxf4, 0-0, Bg7, Bxf4, Qb6+!, Rf2, 0-0-0...",
        "11... Bg7": "very inaccurate; best is gxf4, Bxf4, Qb6, Rb1, h5...",
        "12. Qg4": "again, after Qh5, gxf4, Bxf4, Qb6, Qg5, 0-0, Nb3, I could not see any progress... this pins g5, and the threat fxg5 forces Black to act...",
        "12... h5 13. Qg3 Kf8": "obviously trying to cover for Bg7, in the event of gxf4; but this is a bad move... best here is h4, Qg4, Bf8, or Rg8, 0-0-0, h4...",
        "14. O-O Kg8": "still better is h4, Qg4, gxf4; this declares Rh8 officially dead...",
        "15. Rae1": "after Nf3, gxf4, Bxf4, h4 (Qc7, Rae1), Qg4, f6, exf6, Qxf6, Rae1... so we play it in forward...",
        "15... b5": "after h4, Qg4, h3, g3, gxf4, Bxf4, f5, exf6, Qxf6, Re3, Black might consider b5; now, his position will fall apart swiftly...",
        "16. Nf3": "making the pressure on g5 unbearable; Black will lose both pawns after h4, Qg4, h3, Nxg5, hxg2, Rf2...",
        "16... g4 17. Nd4": "forced, but winning; after Nxd4, Bxd4, Rh6, a3!, a5, f5, most of Blacks' illusions are over... after b4, Nxc6, Bxc6, cxb4, Bb5, Rd1, f5, exf6, Qxf6, f5...",
        "17... Qc7": "making matters worse; as we will soon learn, Qe8 is much needed...",
        "18. Nxc6 Bxc6": "again, not the best; after Qxc6, Bd4, Rh6, Rf2, Rf8, Qh4 (remember that move), Qc7, Black is better prepared for f5...",
        "19. f5": "without Bd7 enforcing e6, this is winning instantly...",
        "19... Bxe5": "after exf5, Rxf5, Black has nothing to hope for either...",
        "20. Qh4": "the move Black had overlooked; the only reply is f6 (to prevent Qg5+ and more mayhem), fxe6, Re8 (to control e6)... then White might consider Rxf6!, Bxf6, Qxf6, with after the much needed Qg7, the forcing Qxg7, Kxg7, Bd4+, Kg8, Bxh8, Kxh8, Bg6, Re7, Bxh5...",
        "20... f6 21. fxe6": "other options for Re8 are b4, Bd4!, Bxd4 (forced, otherwise Bxe5, fxe5 (what else?), Rf7!), cxd4, Rh6, or g3, h3, Re8, or Qe7, Bb6 (against Qxe6?, Bd4, followed by Rxf6), Re8...",
        "21... Re8": "another option for White - next to Rxf6, Bxf6, Qxf6 etc. - is Bd4, Bxd4+, cxd4, Rh6, Re3, Qe7, Rf5, Qa7 (attacking d4), Rxf6 etc, or else Rxh5...",
        "22. Bg5": "after long and careful consideration, this hidden sacrifice is the strongest move: after fxg5?, Qxg5+, Qg7, Rxe5, Black can safely give up; the combined threat of Bxf6, followed by at some point occupying the seventh row, breaks up Blacks' position instantly... eg. Rxe6, Bxf6, Bxf6, Rxf6, Rxf6, Qxf6, and Black is out of moves... after f5, Rxf5, Rxe6, Bf4... after Qa7+, Kh1, Qg7, Bxf6, Bxf6, Rxf6, Rh6, Rf7... forced is Bxh2, Qxh2, Qxh2, Kxh2, fxg5, e7, and the deal is sealed...",
        "22... Bxh2+ 23. Qxh2 Qxh2+ 24. Kxh2 fxg5 25. e7": "Black has no moves left; best is Kg7, Re5, g3+, Kg1, Reg8, Rxg5+, Kh6, Rxg8, Rxg8, Rf6+, Kg7, Rxc6... this pawn is worth a full piece...",
        "25... Rh6": "clearly wants to spare Rh8 when things start to get serious, but this is not helping; now it will cost at least a rook after Re5, g3+, Kxg3, h4+, Kh2, Rh7, Rf8+, or directly Rh7, etcetera... ",
        "26. Re5": "in all variations, Black will lose at least a full piece... best is g3+, Kxg3, h4+, Kh2, Rh7, Rf8+, Rxf8, Bxf7+, Kf7, exf8Q+, Kxf8, Rxg5, and all is over... so Black resigned..."
