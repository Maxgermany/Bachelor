        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3": "?! I believe this is an inaccuracy, because my opinion is that Black is quite happy with the exchanges happening in the game.",
        "4... Nxe4 5. Bxf7+": "Probably better than the straightforward Nxe4, at least he makes my King a little bit exposed.",
        "5... Kxf7 6. Nxe4 d5 7. Neg5+ Kg8 8. d3 h6 9. Nh3 Bxh3": "I played this move after a long thought, but in the end I evaluated that my center strike would have come first.",

        "12... e3": "! Generally I'm a quiet, positional player, but I felt like this move couldn't be bad, and I was really happy to see variation confirmed that.\nIn general, it is usually good to open the enemy King at the cost of a pawn, especially if you can get so many pieces active with gain of some tempi.",
        "13. fxe3 Qh4+ 14. Kf1": "I don't like this, I believe Ke2 would have been more resistant.",
        "14... Qxh3+ 15. Kg1 Bc5": "Another piece comes in with gain of a tempo, and defense is quite difficult now.",
        "16. Qf3": "?? The final mistake, Nc4 or Nf1 would have prolonged the game more.",
        "16... Bxe3+": "! This final blow nicely closes the game, because White loses his Queen by force."
