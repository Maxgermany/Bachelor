        "6. Nce2": "The idea is to avoid exchange of light squared bishops and transfer the knight to the kingside for attack on black's king. Also by forcing black to exchanges dark squared bishops white gains more control than black on the dark squares because his queen is on a more active dark square than black's queen.",

However, here we see that black hastened with Nf5 move and this fact give white a few extra tempo- 13.g4 Nh4 14.Rdf1 Nxg3 15.Rxf3 b5 16.f5 b4 17.fxe6 fxe6 18.Qf4 Qe7 19.Rhf1 Kd7 20.Qf7 Rhf8 21.Bd1 Rxf7 22.Rxf7 bxc3 23.bxc3 =",
