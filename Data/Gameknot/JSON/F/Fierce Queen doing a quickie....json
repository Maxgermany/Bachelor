        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6": "as I usually do, I develop the Hungarian variation after Nf3; nowadays after Nc3, I prefer d6: I learned that the hard way...",
        "3. Bc4": "a very popular move in both the Italian and the Sicilian party: making square f7 a weakness, especially after Ng5; in this Sicilian however, this is a very moot point...",
        "3... Bg7": "still following the Hungarian variation: of course, Ng5 will do nothing after e6; the pointe of this variation, also preparing d7-d5 against Bc4...",
        "4. Nc3": "dangling between two systems: but all the same, Black has to be prepared for Nb5 or Nd5; hence Blacks' next move...",
        "4... e6": "still at risk, in the case of Nb5: the main threat being Nd6+, ruining most of Blacks' plan for setup; safest here is d6 (blocking Nc3-b5-d6), and postpone d7-d5 just a few moves: however, in blitz you do not always have that luxury...",
        "5. d3": "way too passive: d4 was a much better option, in challenging Blacks' setup...",
        "5... a6": "the old Najdorf addition to the Sicilian party: this will rule out Nb5; and Bb5+ in the case of an early needed d7-d5...",
        "6. a3": "for some reason, White wants to challenge the gambit pawn c5: better 0-0 at this point; Black is about to complete the preferred setup...",

        "7... d5": "a bit of positional luck: in most cases in this stage of this opening, Bb5+ is still a possibility, so Black first needs to castle; a6 shielded that...",
        "8. Bb3": "missing the point totally: only after exd5, exd5, Bxc5!, this might work; now it is over...",
        "8... d4": "losing a piece, without any compensation: so White resigned; barely 1 minute in the game..."
