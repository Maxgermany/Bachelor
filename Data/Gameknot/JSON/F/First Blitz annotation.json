    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "King's pawn open.  My default.",
        "1... g6": "Apparently, this is called the Robatsch defence, but I'm not very familiar with it.",
        "2. c3": "I wanted to protect the main diagonal because I've gotten burned and lost my rooks early in some previous games.  Planning on playing 3.d4",
        "2... b6": "I found this to be an odd move.  This does open up the light diagonal, but it's already closed off by my pawn on e4.",
        "3. d4": "Now I take control of the center squares and free up my dark bishop.",
        "3... Bb7": "Again, I don't really get this move.  He may be trying to force me to protect my pawn, but it really accomplishes very little.",
        "4. Nd2": "Protecting my pawn.  In hindsight, 4.f3 probably was a better choice, but it was a blitz game and I didn't think this move over for a long time.  Oh well, this still worked well enough.",
        "4... Nf6": "Now he starts developing some of his pieces.",
        "5. e5": "Now I start to set up what I like to call the \"Flying V\".  There's probably a more technical name than that, but I like my name for it.",
        "5... Nd5": "He saves his knight and gives me the chance to truly set up the flying V.",
        "6. Nc4": "A development move.  Opens up the dark bishop and gets my knight into an attacking position.",
        "6... g5": "No idea why he made this move.  He leaves an unprotected pawn right in my bishop's path and also likely destroys his ability to king-side castle.  This does nothing for development, and will most likely end up only hurting him.",
        "7. f3": "... I should've played 7.Bxg5.  I looked back right after I made this move and facepalmed immediately.  I gave him a free out for his previous bad move.  I'll give myself a \"?\" on this move.",
        "7... Nf4": "Now the pawn move makes sense, even though I should have never let this move happen.",
        "8. Ne2": "I decided not to let his knight stay comfortable.  I decided to threaten it immediately and try to get it on the move.",
        "8... Bh6": "He refuses to move, and instead beefs up his defenses.",
        "9. g3": "No rest for his knight, so I up the pressure.",
        "9... Nh3": "Another \"?\" move, where he leaves an unprotected piece directly in my line of attack.  I wasn't going to let it slide this time.",
        "10. Bxh3": "Boom, early material and development advantage.",
        "10... Rg8": "Don't know what he was going for here.  Not a bad move, but it really accomplishes nothing.",
        "11. f4": "The flying V!!!  For those of you who didn't know what I was talking about earlier, this is it.  Except I probably should've waited a few moves...",
        "11... Bxh1": "... because I let myself get burned by the exact thing I tried to prevent on the other side.  There goes the material advantage...",
        "12. fxg5": "I figured I might as well here, because if nothing else, it winds up as an even trade.",
        "12... Bg7": "Instead of trading, he traps his bishop.  He may have the material advantage, but he's got no development right here.",
        "13. Bf4": "I reestablish a slightly modified flying V, and try to set up for a queen-side castle to threaten his bishop on h1.  I don't like having other pieces on my back rank too much.",
        "13... d5": "He goes to threaten my knight, and maybe try to get his queen into the game.",
        "14. Nd2": "I protect my knight and beef up my defenses.",
        "14... Nc6": "Development, round 2.",
        "15. Qa4": "I really liked this move.  It freezes his knight in an unprotected position, and if he tries to protect it with his queen, he'll lose the queen to my bishop.  And, as a bonus, it sets me up for the queen-side castle.  This is the point in the game where I got pretty confident that I would win.",
        "15... Qd7": "He goes to protect his knight, but I don't think he noticed my bishop...",
        "16. Bxd7+": "I regain the material advantage and take away his ability to castle in one move.",
        "16... Kxd7": "This was his only move in this situation.",
        "17. O-O-O": "Here goes the castle.",
        "17... b5": "Now he goes to threaten my queen, but it's fairly easy to dodge.",
        "18. Qc2": "Protecting my queen, and threatening h1, which is currently unprotected.",
        "18... b4": "Now he starts marching his pawn.  I personally would've played 18...a5, then 19...b4, but this move is effective as well.",
        "19. Rxh1": "Now I take his bishop.  I wasn't going to just leave it there forever.",
        "19... Rab8": "Now he goes to... protect his already protected pawn?  I don't really get this move.  19...a5 would have accomplished the same thing.",
        "20. h4": "Now I start marching my pawns across the board.",
        "20... Na5": "Oh, that's why he moved his rook.  But this also doesn't do much...",
        "21. h5": "Keep the pawns rolling!",
        "21... h6": "Interesting.  I thought he would've wanted to force my pawn to where his rook was, but I guess he thought protecting his bishop was more important.",
        "22. gxh6": "I take the pawn because it puts his bishop under pressure.  If he takes my pawn, he loses his bishop.  Maybe his last move wasn't a great one...",
        "22... Bh8": "He saves his bishop while keeping his rooks connected.",
        "23. h7": "Now I go for the promotion.  If nothing else, I should get a rook out of the deal.",
        "23... Rg4": "He's not going to let me off that easily.  The only problem is that now his rook can't go anywhere...",
        "24. a3": "Now I go to get his pawn out of there.  I don't like it just sitting there.",
        "24... b3": "... Probably should've seen that coming.  But I did notice something that I could do...",
        "25. Qf5+": "I should've noticed this a move earlier.  It forks his king and rook, which guarantees that he'll lose the rook.  Now I've got a nearly insurmountable advantage.",
        "25... e6": "Getting out of check and kind of threatening my queen.",
        "26. Qxg4": "There goes the rook.",
        "26... f5": "Now he tries to really threaten my queen, but forgot (or didn't know about)...",
        "27. exf6 e.p.": "... En passant!  This time I didn't use it just because I could!  It actually really helped for once!",
        "27... Bxf6": "Not much else he could do there.  If he hadn't captured there, I would've promoted in 3 moves.",
        "28. Qg8": "I'm going to give myself a \"!\" for this move (despite the fact that I've barely annotated anything and never given out any of the symbols before this one).  I loved this move because it guarantees a promotion (which always looks cool), but also gives me what amounts to a pxR or pxB trade.  I've also always wanted to make a conscious queen sacrifice, and this was my chance.",
        "28... Rxg8": "He goes for the rook exchange.  I think that 28...Rb6 was the best move, because then he would lose his bishop instead of his rook, but it wouldn't have changed much in the grand scheme of things.",
        "29. hxg8=Q": "There goes the promotion, which gives me a ridiculous advantage in almost every facet.  Barring an incredibly bad move by me, I'm almost sure I would've won from this point.",
        "29... Bxd4": "Now I think he shifted into desperation mode.  This was a bad trade at even material, but at this point, it was killer.",
        "30. cxd4": "Now, it was really only a matter of time until mate.",
        "30... Nc4 31. Nxc4 dxc4 32. Qb8 Kc6 33. Qxc7+ Kd5 34. Qc5+ Ke4 35. Qe5+ Kf3 36. h6 Kg2 37. Rg1+ Kf2 38. Qe3#": "Nothing much of notice happened over those last 8 moves, just me constantly putting him in check until mate.  I hope I did alright for my first blitz annotation, and please, give me feedback!  I really like annotating these games, and I would like to start moving up to some higher level games."
