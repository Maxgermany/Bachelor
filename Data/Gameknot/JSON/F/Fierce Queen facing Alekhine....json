        "1. e4 Nf6": "being the romantic fool that I am, my heart always jumps up at ancient opening styles; this is the Alekhine Defense, cooked up a century ago, by one of the greatest world champions ever... White has virtually no other options than e5...",
        "2. e5 Nd5 3. d4": "preparing Nf3, the Flohr approach; we keep an eventual c4 for later use...",
        "3... c5": "not how Alekhine meant this; most theory follows with e6, Nf3, or d6... this will end up in Sicilian variations for White, after dxc5, Qa5+...",
        "4. dxc5 Qa5+ 5. c3": "the best move; all else is failing...",
        "5... Qxc5 6. Nf3 e6": "a bit uncautious, considering Whites' next plan of action; better is Qc6, Nbd2, e6...",
        "7. Nbd2 f5": "we already left all charted territory; Black is trying to unbalance the game, but to no avail...",
        "8. Nb3 Qc7 9. Nbd4 Bc5": "overlooking Whites' next opportunity completely; best course of action is a6 (blocks Nb5), Bd3 (Nxf5?, Nxc3!, Nd6+, Qxd6), Nc6, 0-0, Nxd4, cxd4, or directly Nc6, Nb5, Qa5...",
        "10. Nxf5": "no rocket science involved here: Nxg7+ is a nasty threat, and g6 does not work after Ng7+ and Bh6; after exf5, of course Qxd5... after Bf8, Nd6+, Bxd6, exd6...",
        "10... O-O 11. Ne3": "I liked this better than Nfd4; Black cannot afford Nxd5, exd5, Qxd5+...",
        "11... Nf4 12. Nc4 Nc6 13. Be3": "putting White in control...",
        "13... Be7": "Black has not much choice left; after b6, Qd2, Ng6, Bxc5, bxc5, or Bxe3, fxe3, Ng6, White takes control with Qd6...",
        "14. Bxf4": "Qb3, Rb8 leads to nothing; we need to keep Black occupied... after Rxf4, Qd2...",
        "14... Rxf4 15. Qd2 Rxf3": "after Rf8, Qe3! (0-0-0, b5!), Rxf3 is not of much use anymore; and after b5, simply Ncd2 is solving all problems... this is Blacks' last chance to unbalance Whites' game...",
        "16. gxf3": "now after b5, Nd6, Nxe5, 0-0-0...",
        "16... Nxe5": "best here is b5, Nd6, Nxe5, 0-0-0, b4, Qd4, Bxd6, Qxd6, Qxd6, Rxd6, bxc3, bxc3, Nf7... now, Black is trading his only active piece at this point in development...",
        "17. Nxe5 Qxe5+ 18. Qe3 Qc7": "a bit better is Qf6 (mainly preventing Qg5), f4, d5, Bh3, Qh6, 0-0, Bc5!, Qxc5, Qxh3...",
        "19. O-O-O Bc5": "as was to be expected...",
        "20. Qg5": "not of real use is Qd2, d5, and Blacks' game is opening up... this is the only way, to stir up some attack; after Bxf2, Bd3!, Whites' development is suddenly completed and ready for a Kings' attack via Rg1, Bxg1, Rxg1, or Rd2, Bc5, Rg2... after d5 (the only option to guard g6), always Bd3; the Black King is getting into trouble, with both Kings' pawns under attack...",
        "20... d5 21. Bd3 h6": "not the best way to handle this; the safest way is Bd6, Kb1 (to get out of checks), g6, Rhg1, Qf7, h4, Bf4... this gives White an opportunity that cannot be missed...",
        "22. Qg6 Qf7": "the threat Qe8 is too potent, to let just slip by; so black has to act... this gives White the opportunity to displace the Black pieces...",
        "23. Qh7+ Kf8 24. Kb1": "better safe than sorry; Black has some annoying checks...",
        "24... Bxf2": "after Bd7, Rhg1, Bxf2, Rg6!, Black is probably not better off...",
        "25. Rhf1 Bc5 26. Bc2": "preparing Bb3...",
        "26... Qg8 27. Qd3 Qf7 28. f4 b6": "Black still needs to develop two full pieces; but White means business...",
        "29. Rde1 Bd6": "better a5, Qh7, Qg8, Qg6, Qf7, Qxf7+, Kxf7, f5, and lose some material first...",
        "30. f5": "devastating; after exf5, Bb3, f4, Bxd5, Black is in big trouble... then after Bf5, Be4, Bxe4, Rxe4, leaving Bd6 uncovered......",
        "30... e5": "this move is not really helpful; now, White puts up the ante... after f6, gxf6, Qd2, followed by Qh6+, things are starting to look grim for Black...",
        "31. f6 gxf6 32. Qd2": "I took a long time, to look at Rxf6?!, Qxf6, Rf1, Qxf1+, Qxf1+, Ke7 (the only one), Qd3, Rb8 (against Qxd5), Qh7+, Kd8, Qxh6, but after that I saw no progress; it is only a matter of time for Black, to develop his pieces... instead of Qxh6, Qg8+ or Qf7 however, are winning; as I found out after the game...",
        "32... Ke7": "or Be6, Qxh6+, Ke7...",
        "33. Qxh6 Ba6": "not the best move, but it might disrupt Whites' play... Be6 was still preferred; now, White has a chance to rearrange his pieces...",
        "34. Rf4": "after Rg1, Rg8, Bf5 (or Rxg8, Qxg8, Bf5), I feared e4, Ka1... now we have a chance to move this rook to the h-file...",
        "34... Qf8": "better Bc8; the bishop is useless on a6...",
        "35. Qh3": "no use in Qh7+, Qf7, Qh3... the White Queen is mainly preparing Bf5...",
        "35... Bc8 36. Bf5 Bxf5+ 37. Rxf5": "stronger than Qxf5, Qf7, Rh4, Rg8!, Rh6, Rg5...",
        "37... Qg8": "a bit better is Qf7, Rh5 (Ref1, Rf8, leads to nothing), Rg8...",
        "38. Qf3": "the best move to keep things going; after e4, Qe2, Qe6, Rh5...",
        "38... Rf8": "somewhat better is e4, Qe2, Qe6, Rh5, Kd7, Qb5+, Kc7; this gives White new opportunities...",
        "39. h4": "I had calculated Rd1, Qg6, h4, so I decided to play in forward; now, after e4, c4!, Qg3, Qe2... but I hadn't anticipated Blacks' reply...",
        "39... Qe6": "this strong reply puts White back to the drawing board; after e4 and Be5, Whites' attack halts since both d5 and f6 get suddenly covered... confident in my approach however, I continued as planned...",
        "40. Rd1": "looking back, Rh5 would have been more consequent, but after f5, c4, e4, cxd5, Qxd5, Qe2, Rc8, things get out of hand... the planned e4, Qh5, Be5, Qh7+, works only after Kd6, Qxa7; but after Qf7, the fun is over... we need to find a different approach for e4...",
        "40... e4 41. Qf1 Be5 42. Rf2 Rd8 43. h5 Qg4 44. Rfd2 e3": "by this time, I started to feel uncomfortable; I reckoned with Qxh5, Rxd5, Rxd5, Rxd5, e3!, Rg2, e2 and got stuck... after the game, I found Qg2 (in stead of Rg2, e2) Qg7+, and White is winning... in fact, this is a bad move for Black; but I failed to see it...",
        "45. Rg2": "best here is Qe2, but I was calculating on Qxh5; Blacks' reply is much stronger...",
        "45... Qe4+ 46. Ka1 f5 47. Re1 d4 48. cxd4 Rxd4 49. Qg1 f4 50. Rge2": "gradually, White has no advantages left whatsoever; after Rb4, White has no play left and the game is drawn for both after Rc1, Rxb2, Rxb2, Bxb2+, Kxb2, Qb4+, and perpetual check... so I offered a draw...",
        "50... Ra4": "Black declined, and played this...",
        "51. Rc1": "this move suddenly looked more promising; but Black can simply draw with Qf5...",
        "51... Rc4": "and even this one; as I failed to notice... my oppononent offered draw, which I rejected...",
        "52. Rxc4 Qxc4": "at this point, all of Blacks problems are solved; a fact, I failed to recognize...",
        "53. Re1": "correct is Qd1 or Qe1, but blindly I decided to stir up some 'draw-safe' attack via Rc1, knowing that Bxf2+, Kxf2, would always lead to a draw; much to my dismay... at the same time, I again offered a draw; my opponent was obviously convinced, and he accepted... lucky for me, he didn't find Qc2!!, Rb1 (forced), e2!, Qe1 (trust me: the best), f3!, and White can safely give up... at least, he obviously was not using a chess program; I salute this opponent, for his sportsmanship, and his great skills..."
