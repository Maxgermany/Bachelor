        "4. Kf1": "Very poor play on J.B.'s part, in retrospect. He probably should have played 3 Q-R5 ch himself on the previous move. Even here 4 P-N3 wouldn't leave me with much to do except retreat my Queen.",
        "4... Qxf4+": "I go for the material grab.",
        "5. Ke1": "It's just amazing how bad both he and I were at strategy back then. 5 N-B3 develops a piece and breaks the \"attack\".",
        "5... Bc5": "With an obvious threat... at least I thought it was obvious. I didn't think he'd actually fall into it, but I figured I'd better start developing.",
        "6. Nc3": "Development is always good. But you have to always make sure...",
        "6... Qf2#": "...you guard against checkmates first!"
