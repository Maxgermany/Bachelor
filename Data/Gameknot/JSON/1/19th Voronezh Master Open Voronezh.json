        "9... O-O 10. c3 a5 11. e5 Nd7 12. Nf3 c5 13. Bf4 Ba6": "Black tries to exchange White\u2019s key Bishop.",
        "14. Bc2": "But of course White prefers to keep it on the board.",
        "14... Rb8 15. Qd2 Re8": "15\u2026Rxb2? would be a blunder, because of the discovery 16.Bxh7+.",
        "16. h4 d4": "This is an inaccuracy and gives white a lot of play.\n\nBlack could\u2019ve aimed for a draw with 16\u2026Bxh4 17.Nxh4 Qxh4 18.Bg5 Qg4 (18\u2026Qc4 19.Re3) 19.Bd1 Qf5 20.Bc2 Qg4 21.Bd. If white plays on, he is down a pawn and black is a little better. And Black\u2019s Queen cannot escape via c4 either, because of 22.Be2. But given the huge rating difference it is understandable that Black is looking for more than a draw.",
        "17. cxd4 cxd4 18. Bg5": "Black\u2019s idea was that if 18.Nxd4 Bb4 or 18.Qxd4 Bc5.",
        "18... f6": "A very risky move. 18\u2026Bxg5 19.Nxg5 Nf8 lead to a safer position for black.",
        "19. exf6 gxf6 20. Bh6": "Better was 20.Rxe6 Bc4 (20\u2026fxg5 21.Rxa6 Nc5 22.Rxa5 d3 23.Ba4 White is up 2 pawns with a solid advantage.) 21.Re4 fxg5 22.Rxd4 Bb4 (22\u2026Bb5 23.a4 Bc6 24.Qd3; 22\u2026Be6 23.Re1 Bc5 24.Rxe6) 23.Bxh7+! Kh8 (23\u2026Kxh7? 24.Rxd7+) 24.Qc2 Be6 25.hxg5 with a winning position.",
        "20... e5": "Black has a nice center, but due to the lack of a g-pawn Black\u2019s King is in danger.",
        "21. Re4": "A natural and strong attacking move.",
        "21... Kh8": "Black\u2019s best choice was 21\u2026Bf8 22.Bb3+ Kh8 23.Rg4 Rxb3 24.axb3 f5 25.Rg3 f4 26.Bxf4 exf4 27.Qxf4 Bg7 28.Ng5 Qf6 29.Nf7+ Kg8 30.Qxf6 Nxf6 31.Nd6 and White is better, but Black has some hope to survive.",
        "22. Nxd4": "Another good option was 22.Bg7+ Kxg7 23.Rg4+ Kf7 24.Qh6 with a killer attack.",
        "22... exd4": "Relatively best was 22\u2026Bb4 23.Bg7+ Kxg7 24.Rg4+ Kh8 25.Qh6 Re7 26.Nc6 Qf8 27.Qxf8+ Rxf8 28.Rxb4 axb4 29.Nxe7 but white has a winning endgame advantage.",

        "26. Qd5": "Black cannot stop the mate. If he goes 26\u2026Bc5, then 27.Rg8+ Ke7 28.Rg7+ Kf8 29.Qf7 checkmate."
