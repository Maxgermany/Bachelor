        "1. b3": "This game I am black, and playing OTB against, on average, the best player in our office.  I normally lose to him when he's white, but this time I pulled one out in high fashion. ",
        "1... e5": "I usually play the sicillian, but if he's going to give me the center I shall take it. ",
        "2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e4 Nf6 4. d3": "I don't like this move for white, I never use this move.  He's letting me develop pieces while he's moving pawns. ",
        "4... Bc5 5. h3": "White should not be defensive in the opening, this makes no sense right now because the N can't move to g4 without being snaked by the Queen. ",
        "5... d5": "Figure I would force the issue, and claim the middle. ",
        "6. exd5 Nxd5 7. Nc3 Bd4 8. Nge2 O-O": "I knew I had enough man power to at least come out even in a trade, so I elected to castle and leave him with many options to consider...and a desparate feeling of clausterphobia. ",
        "9. Nxd4 exd4": "Opening up the e-file and attacking his N",
        "10. Nxd5 Re8+": "Here I knew no matter what I was going to have his N back, always check, it might be mate. :)",

        "13. Kd2 Qg5 14. Kc3 Qa5+": "Alert!  The king is in peril!  His only option is to allow mate, p-b4, QxP# ....K-c4, B-e6#!",
        "15. Kc4 Be6#": "Black wins in swift fashion.  Mental note, don't move pawns while allowing your opponent to develop minor pieces. "
