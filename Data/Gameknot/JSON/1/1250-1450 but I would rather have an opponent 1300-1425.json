    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "I decided to annotate this game because I won it using the g and h pawns (having already castled kingside!) usually this is not recommended as it leaves the king open, but here it worked out well in the end\r\n\r\nQueen's pawn opening: I always like to play this, and then play the Blackmar-Diemer gambit if black moves d5 - it leads to a very open game and an interesting trap, the Halosar trap, if black makes all the obvious moves (1. d4 d5 2. e4 dxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 exf3 5. Qxf3 Qxd4 6. Be3 Qb4 7. O-O-O Bg4 8. Nb5)  ",
        "1... g6 2. e4": "I take what he gives me: center control",
        "2... Bg7 3. Nc3 c6 4. Nf3": "Continuing normal development, I admit I was using the Game DB at this point",
        "4... d6 5. Be2": "I put the bishop there because I wanted my queen on d3 and if I'd put the B on e3 then 5. Bd3 d5 and I have to move twice, which is never good during development",
        "5... Nf6 6. Bf4 O-O 7. O-O": "Both sides have now castled, but white has a clear lead in development and center control. Black has wasted too much time moving his pawns and has to catch up - the difference is not dramatic though",
        "7... Nbd7 8. Qd3": "I've now linked my rooks, finishing development",
        "8... Re8": "Black is preparing to push the pawn to e5",
        "9. e5": "But I'd rather take the initiative. ",
        "9... dxe5 10. dxe5 Nh5 11. Qe4 Nxf4 12. Qxf4": "I'm liking the idea of the B on c4, with the queen aiming down at that f7 square Notice how the rook is trapped in by his own pawn, because I didn't let him push on e5",
        "12... Qc7 13. Rfe1": "Bringing my rook to what is soon to be an open file.\r\nThis is the first interesting position of the game. If black takes the pawn, he is pinning his piece (13 ... Bxe5 14 Nxe5 Nxe5 or 13 ... Nxe5)",
        "13... Nxe5": "He takes with the knight. I was rather hoping he'd take with the bishop, but hey, you can't have everything",
        "14. Bc4": "The idea behind this move is that he won't take the bishop as I would get the queen. I am also targeting f7. What I didn't realise was Nxf3 is check. Would it probably have been better to move Kh1 first?",
        "14... Nxf3+ 15. Qxf3 Bf5 16. g4": "This move might look a little bit crazy, but it was the best thing I could think of at the time and as you'll see it's going to come in useful soon enough",
        "16... Bd7": "I don't understand this move. I suppose Bxc2 would have been too pointless",
        "17. Qxf7+": "Finally doing what I've been waiting to do for a while but...",
        "17... Kh8": "Now what? I haven't actually got any way to keep the momentum going",
        "18. g5": "This was actually only done to stop the bishop taking it, but once again it will soon be useful",
        "18... Be5 19. h4": "Now I'm beginning to have a few ideas of where this is going, the most prominent being 20. h5 gxh5 21. Qxh5",
        "19... Bd6": "Now my queen is in trouble: if he plays Rf8 I have nowhere to go",
        "20. Bd3": "Making an escape route",
        "20... b5": "Now this was a poor move I thought, completely losing all momentum. Much better would have been 20. Rf8, forcing my queen back to c4. Maybe mikkino was worried about a checkmate with the queen on d4 and the bishop on c4 later on in the game, but he would have had plenty of time to block that.",
        "21. Bxg6": "This is only a half sacrifice, as it leads to his king being completely exposed",
        "21... hxg6 22. Qxg6": "His only piece on the f,g and h files is his king on h1! In particular his queen is completely blocked off by his own pieces now. Lots of pressure on mikkino now...",
        "22... Be5": "The only move to survive ...",
        "23. Qh6+ Kg8": "forced",
        "24. g6 Bg7": "pretty much forced as well, although Be6 would have also done the job I think",
        "25. Qh7+ Kf8 26. h5": "If I push to h6 it's mate (27. h6 Bxh6 28. Qf7# or 27. h6 ... 28. hxg7#)",
        "26... Qf4": "Once again, the only move to stop mate",
        "27. Re3": "I thought for a long time about this move, but in the end decided it was the best. I was particularly worried about a check on g5, then him bringing the bishop into play on h3.",
        "27... Qh6": "Mikkino resigned at this point, as Rf3+ leads to checkmate. I was quite disappointed that it ended like this, I would have liked to finish the game. Maybe mikkino pressed submit too quickly, which is a pretty bad way to end. \r\nExcept for that and my obvious queen over-dependency i this game, I was quite pleased about this game: neglecting my own king safety to put a lot of pressure in his king. Please leave comments, so I can try to improve my chess playing. Valentin"
