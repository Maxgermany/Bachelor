        "1. e4 b6 2. d4 Bb7 3. Nc3 e6 4. Nf3 Bb4": "I've been experimenting with Owens Defense, but I'm not always happy with the positions I get.  ",
        "5. Bd2": "Bd2 loses a pawn because Black can remove the defender.  Bd3 is commonly played here instead.",
        "5... Bxc3 6. Bxc3 Bxe4 7. Bd3 Bb7 8. O-O d5 9. Bb5+": "This check seems like it uses a tempo but doesn't really damage Black's position.",
        "9... c6 10. Bd3 Nf6 11. Bd2 h6 12. Re1 O-O": "Black should be able to complete development comfortably here--and be up a pawn.",
        "13. Ne5 Nbd7 14. Nxd7": "I think this exchange helps Black.  e5 is a strong square for White's Knight.",
        "14... Qxd7 15. Bb4 Rfc8 16. Re5 c5 17. dxc5 bxc5 18. Bd2": "I was not sure what the best plan was at this point.  Ultimately I decided that I had mobile Queenside pawns and that I would push them.  The Re5 is also hanging, which might lead to a tactic later.",
        "18... c4 19. Be2 d4 20. a4": "I thought this was a good move and wasn't something that I considered.  Rb5 would be an annoyance.",
        "20... a6 21. a5 c3 22. bxc3 dxc3 23. Be3 Qxd1+ 24. Rxd1 Nd5": "I think Black's position here is slightly preferable.",
        "25. Bd4 Bc6 26. Bf3": "White has ideas about removing the defender of c3.",
        "26... Rab8 27. Rd3": "Now White attacks c3 again.",
        "27... Ba4 28. Bxd5": "This mistake is fatal because of Black's weak back rank.  The Bf3 was guarding c1 before, but now there is no protection.",
        "28... Rb1+": "White resigned here.  Both Rooks can be interposed, but checkmate is inevitable.  White found a way to win the c3 pawn, but missed the checkmate threat."
