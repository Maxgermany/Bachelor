    "moves": {
        "1. Nf3": "once again a lot of fun with a very offensive game due to many mistakes by my opponent. I annotate it because I like to replay the few funny traps I made here. Once again the game has no value in se, but just for the fun of it.",
        "1... a6": "is this theorY?",
        "2. d4 d5 3. Bf4 Nc6 4. e3 h5": "well, once again, i guess bluemarble \"tries\" strange stuff to disturb me",
        "5. c4 Bg4 6. Nc3": "\"I don't care\" and i play my moves...",
        "6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 Nf6": "all my pieces are now developed, my king is about to castle anytime and black is not exactly coordinated. e5 is not an option to open the game... I don't see anything for them, and I will restrict him other possibilities",
        "8. h3 Bxf3": "chooses to drop his most active piece",
        "9. Qxf3 e6 10. O-O": "i feel very comfortable. Even my queen is not too badly placed.",
        "10... Bd6 11. Bg5": "i don't mean to offer him the possibility to equal again like in the first game where I made a stupide mistake after having gained a pawn.",
        "11... Qd7": "once again, bluemarble gives me a pawn... best was to come back with bishop on e7",
        "12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. Qxf6": "gloup",
        "13... Rg8": "of course this rook is not really comfortable. And the h5 pawn is too well exposed. I have a few targets here. On the other side, I have to be careful for eventual traps on h3 and g2",
        "14. Ne4 Rg6": "that is not accurate.",
        "15. Qh8+": "that is why: if he moves the king, I take the rook. I cautiously calculated that there is no danger for my king to let my queen in a8 in case i have to go there.",
        "15... Bf8": "but he thinks he has a better defense. ",
        "16. Nf6+": "well, it only loses quality.",
        "16... Rxf6": "forced or loses queen.",
        "17. Qxf6": "gloups",
        "17... Be7 18. Qh8+": "again? I am pointing to the h5 pawn, now",
        "18... Bf8 19. Qxh5": "gloups",
        "19... O-O-O": "looks like THE move to try something -though it is obviously over here",
        "20. Rfc1": "let us find some other targets",
        "20... Be7 21. Qf3": "like this beautiful knight",
        "21... f6": "he may have thought i was pointing the pawn: i didn't event see it",
        "22. Bxa6": "and here is the trap of course. We are now two on the knight and the b7 pawn is pinned",
        "22... Rg8": "open the fire for his own trap that will never come to end",
        "23. Qxc6": "because we are going to exchange now...",
        "23... Qxc6 24. Rxc6 bxa6": "all of this for... one more pawn... ",
        "25. Rxe6": "well lets say two pawns",
        "25... Kd7 26. Rxa6": "well, no, three pawns (though this last one was not in my mind)",
        "26... Bd6 27. a3 Rg5 28. Rc1 Rb5 29. b4": "limitating all the possibilities",
        "29... f5 30. f4": "closing doors",
        "30... Rb6": "?? things get worse and worse for black by simplifying...",
        "31. Rxb6 cxb6 32. g4 fxg4 33. hxg4": "it is now clear that nothing can stop all this stuff...",
        "33... Ke6": "but bluemarble just likes to fight. ",
        "34. Rc6": "one last pawn away",
        "34... Kd5 35. Rxb6 Bc7 36. Ra6 Ke4 37. Kf2": "may be my only mistake here: i could have played Re6+ to make it quicker",
        "37... Bxf4 38. exf4 Kxf4 39. d5": "that's all folks, thank you",
        "39... Kxg4 40. d6 Kf5 41. d7": "i said thank you :-)",
        "41... Kg4 42. d8=Q Kf5 43. Qe7 Kg4 44. Rf6 Kg5": "was he thinking about a mistake to get a draw?",
