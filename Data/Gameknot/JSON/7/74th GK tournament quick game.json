        "1. c4": "Many people play this opening and it's a great opening. I used to play it all the time, but I don't play it anymore. When I played it, I never played a fianchetto on the g2 square. That's maybe the reason I had trouble with it. Not playing the fianchetto is still o.k, but playing the fianchetto is better for attacking the center.",
        "1... e5": "A common response to c4.",
        "2. Nc3": "Still nothing wrong. ",
        "2... Qf6": "The first strange move of the game. As mentionned in another annotated game, early queen moves are almost always bad since the queen will usualy get chased around. ",
        "3. f3": "This move does two things. It would later help support e4 and White already sees what black's plan: Mate on f2. It's a little early to play this move and Nf3 does exactly the same thing AND developes a piece. The big downside to this move is that it loses a pawn after Qh4+.",
        "3... Bc5": "Black missed their chance (again). Black will be disappointed to know that the quick mate they were thinking of doesn't work.",
        "4. a3": "A waste of a move. The plan for white is to chase away the bishop, which is not a good plan.",
        "4... e4": "Who want's free pawns? darkblue is giving them out for free!",
        "5. b4": "Obviously _sarg_ doesn't want any. b4 isn't a bad move. White can take the pawn later.",
        "5... exf3": "Black sets up a small trap. If white takes the pawn with the g pawn, it's mate with Qg4. If white takes the big pawn (bishop), black will win with the funniest mate of all time with f2! All white has to do is take the pawn with the knight.",
        "6. gxf3": "White chose the wrong defence.",
        "6... Qh4#": "And in 6 moves black has won. Remember that this game was played in the casual section of the tournament. Congratulations to black for finally getting their revenge."
