        "1. d4": "Started annotating this around move 25.\r\nStarted out trying to play the Stonewall Dutch against the d4 opening\r\nNever got to play a standard Stonewall \r\nHas been an interesting game - some blunders on my part.",
        "1... f5 2. e3 d5": "maybe should have played e6 - later was hard to play e6",
        "3. Nf3 Nf6 4. c4": "went with c6 - could have done e6",
        "4... c6 5. Ne5 Nbd7": "want to trade off that White Knight on e5\r\n",
        "6. cxd5 cxd5": "cxd5 was somewhat unexpected - kind of different style",
        "7. g3": "looks like White will finchetto the white square bishop",
        "7... Nxe5 8. dxe5 Ne4": "was planning Ne4 at some point anyway\r\n",
        "9. f3 Nc5": "didnot see f3 coming\r\n",
        "10. e4 fxe4 11. Be3 b6": "some protection for the N",
        "12. Bxc5": "didnot expect White to trade a bishop for a knight,  If I was playing white and wanted to chase the knight, would have considered b4.  bxc5 gives me connected pawns in the center",
        "12... bxc5 13. fxe4": "Don't want to capture dxe4 - gives me isolated stacked pawns",
        "13... d4 14. Qf3": "White Qg3 -This is a problem - will be hard to castle kingside and queenside is not appealing",
        "14... e6": "Wish I had done this sooner",
        "15. Nd2 Qa5": "Qa5 - not sure if this is a good move\r\n",
        "16. Bc4 Be7": "thinking white could castle resulting in a battery of Queen and Rook - would leave the knight open",
        "17. O-O": "white castles - free knight?",
        "17... Qxd2 18. Qf7+ Kd7": "I could be in trouble",
        "19. Qxe6+ Kd8 20. Rf2": "my next move is a blunder.  If white does Rf7 - that would create a lot of pressure on me",
        "20... Qe3": "While Qe3 pins the rook - did not see the check/attack on the rook - should have traded queens",
        "21. Qd5+": "I think I am in trouble now",
        "21... Kc7 22. Qxa8": "Really in trouble now - about to try a hail mary - will trade the remaining rook for a shot at checkmate - Bb7 Qxh8, Qxe4  followed by Qh1# .  If he sees it and does Kf1, will get the rook back",
        "22... Bb7 23. Qxh8 Qxe4 24. Kf1": "so I will get the rook back after Qh1+",
        "24... Qh1+ 25. Ke2 Qxa1": "back to -2 - could be a wild game\r\nThink I have a shot if I keep up a series of checks with the Queen and the Bishops\r\nHave to be careful to avoid another blunder\r\nI anticipate Kd3 so that the Rook will defend the b pawn.  Response would be Qd1+\r\n",
        "26. Kd3 Qd1+": "got to keep checking - could lose the black square bishop otherwise",
        "27. Rd2 Qf1+ 28. Re2 Qf3+": "continuing with the checks - keeping queen on 3rd rank forces a retreat",
        "29. Kd2 Bg5+": "get the black square bishop involved - however will lose it as soon as I don't check.  Think I can win both the rook and the bishop for the black square bishop",
        "30. Kd1 Qf1+": "Kc2 will cause problems for me long term - still think I can win - have to avoid taking the Rook since it is guarded by the bishop - will have to take the bishp first\r\n\r\nif Kc2, I will lose the ability to continue the checks at some point - one sceanrio even had black being checkmated - Kc2  Qc1, Kb3 Qd1, Ka3  now what - Bc6 threating mate with Qa4.  That would allow White  Qxg7+ with Q attack on g5",
        "31. Kc2 Qc1+ 32. Kb3 Qd1+ 33. Ka3 Kb6 34. Qxg7 Bc6": "Will give up the Black square bishop for a shot at checkmate",
        "35. Qxg5 Qa4#": "He takes the bishop but gives me checkmate"
