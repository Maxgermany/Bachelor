        "4... Bc5": "I've never seen a response to the Fried Liver like this before.",
        "5. Nxf7": "Thought I won something here as well as a pawn.",
        "5... Bxf2+": "So this line for the Fried Liver apparently is called the Traxxler (Sorry, I don't know how to spell it). ",
        "6. Kxf2": "Apparently a mistake by me. I'm supposed to move Kf1 instead of Kxf2.",
        "6... Nxe4+": "Getting slightly worried as I've never seen this line before.",
        "7. Ke3 Qh4": "At this point I figured I might as well use my king as a supporting piece since it was basically in the middle of the board almost...haha",
        "8. Qf3": "Adding support to the Knight on f7 and preventing Qf4.",

Thus he just moved regularly and played Nxc2++ which theoretically is checkmate but since I had him in check it was illegal. Oh well, too late to change the results now.",
