        "1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Nc3 e6 5. g4 Bg6 6. Nge2 c5 7. h4 f6": "Black has played both pawn breaks (c5 and f6) to liquidate the center and occupy it.  Liquidation of the center  suits White since he has a lead in development.",
        "8. Bg2": "Main line is 8 h5.",
        "8... Nc6 9. f4 cxd4": "this leads to the win of White's c2 pawn at the cost of putting White even further ahead in development. 9...Nge7 is the normal move.",
        "10. Nxd4 Nxd4 11. Qxd4 Bxc2 12. f5": "White tries to breakthrough the center to make his lead in development tell.  12 Be3 is probably better and would give White a small edge.",
        "12... exf5 13. Bxd5 Ne7 14. Rh2": "14 exf6 is probably better, after ...Nxd5 15 Nxd5 White has a small edge.",
        "14... Nxd5 15. Nxd5 Be4 16. Qa4+ Kf7 17. e6+": "Here Black timed out.  17 Nc3 would be an equal position.  After the text (17 e6 ) White is lost according to Fritz.  Maybe so, but it would take precise defense."
