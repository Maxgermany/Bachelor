        "6. Bxc6+": "With the idea of creating a long term weakness in White's queenside pawn structure",
        "6... bxc6 7. d4 exd4 8. Qxd4 Bb7": "Better moves to consider here were Be7 and c5 for example",
        "9. Nc3 Be7 10. e5": "Trying to gain some advantage from White's Queen still being in the centre",
        "10... dxe5 11. Qxe5 Qd6": "White's position clearly looks preferable here and so an exchange of Queen's would only help Black's position",
        "12. Qe2 O-O 13. Be3": "A natural development move",
        "13... Nd5": "I do not want my own pawn structure comprimised by Black exchanging on c3",
        "14. Ne4 Qg6 15. Ng3 Nxe3": "Black gains the Bishop pair and this a strategic gain in this open position.  I will need to exchange one of them for a knight",
        "16. Qxe3 Bd6 17. c3": "Simply defending the hanging pawn",
        "17... c5 18. Rfe1 Rfe8": "This move gives White the option of exchanging the Queen for two Rooks.  Giving that Black's bishop would be pinned and White's two knights are well placed to join an attack, it is an option I take",
        "19. Qxe8+ Rxe8 20. Rxe8+ Bf8 21. Ne5": "Attacking the Queen but also threatening Nd7 followed by Rxf8#",
        "21... Qd6": "This defends the d7 square but of course there is another Knight to bear down on the position and renew White's simple threat",
        "22. Nf5": "Black resigns as he can no longer defend the e7 square.  For example, if 22. ... Qb6 then 23. Ne7+ Kh8 and 24. Rxf8#.  However, there is also 22. ...Qf6 but 23. Nd7 is winning for White "
