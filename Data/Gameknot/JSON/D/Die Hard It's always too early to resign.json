    "moves": {
        "1. c4": "For many years my favorite: my stock opening move in OTB and CC.",
        "1... e5": "A good response.  It can lead to Reversed Sicilians, which is not especially desirable for White, but there are other possibilties...",
        "2. g3": "The move order is flexible here.  I used to play 2.Nc3 then 3.g3, but there's nothing wrong with White's choice.",
        "2... Nf6 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. Nc3 Bc5": "Possibly 4....Bb4 or 4...Be7 are better choices.  Sooner or later, White will want to expand on the Q-wing, and the c5-square for the bishop will tend to accelerate that expansion.  This indeed happens in the game, though not in the usual circumstances...",
        "5. d3": "I used to like 5.e3 here, but the text is OK.",
        "5... Ng4": "(?) Premature.  The sequel indicates that Black had more in mind than a cheap kight-fork threat, but miscalculated badly...",
        "6. e3": "Repulsing the attack at once.  Black remains unconvinced.",
        "6... Qf6": "(??) Simply having overlooked the discovered attack on the g4-knight!",
        "7. Qxg4 Nb4": "(?!) A piece down, Black judges 2 tempi a reasonable price to induce White to recall the queen.  It's hard to say he's wrong in the circumstances, but ...d6 was probably a better choice.",
        "8. Qd1 d6 9. a3": "Presenting the bill.  White gets a very quick expansion on the Q-side, altogether desirable from his point of view.  ",
        "9... Nc6 10. b4": "See my note to Black's 4th.",
        "10... Bb6 11. Nd5 Qe6": "(?!) Possibly 11...Qd8 is preferable, as that potential for a family check at c7 could become dangerous...",
        "12. Qc2": "(?!)  Worth considering was 12.a4 with the idea 12...a5 13.c5! ",
        "12... O-O 13. Nxb6": "(?!) White is starting to neglect his development.  There was nio need to be in such a hurry to exchange a well posted knight for a moribund bishop, however desirable exchanges usually are when a piece ahead.  Here, too, Black gets a useful file opened for his a-rook.  More in keeping were developing moves like 13.Nf3 or 13.Ne2 or 13.Bb2.  ",
        "13... axb6 14. c5": "(?) A mistake that Black also misses.  ",
        "14... Re8": "(?!) Better is to exploit the half-pin on the a-file: 14...Nxb4!  It's no more than a raid, but a pawn's a pawn for a' tha'.",
        "15. cxb6": "15.b5!",
        "15... Nd4": "(?) Ingenious.  It seems almost a pity to give it a '?' but White can get away simply with taking the knight: 16.exd4 exd4ch 17.Ne2  etc.  Instead, 15...Nxb4! still wins a pawn.",
        "16. Qxc7": "(!?) This allows Black to save his d4-knight, though a piece and two pawns to the good ought to be enough to win!  16...Nb3 17.Rb1 Nxc1 18.Qxc1...",
        "16... Qb3": "\"Oh, sir, but I insist!\"",
        "17. exd4": "\"Why, thank you sir.\" White boldly pockets the second piece.  Has Black enough attack? Surely not...",
        "17... exd4+ 18. Kd2": "(!) Bold and correct.  Ordinarily there's considerable risk in keeping the K in the centre, but White is judging that his defensive resources are sufficient, and/or that Black, his Q-side pieces still at home, hasn't enough for a decisive attack.",
        "18... Bf5 19. Qc2": "(!?) Probably sufficient, but even better was 19.Qc4!, which leaves Black the choice of exchanging queens whilst still two pieces down, or the retreat 19...Qa5 20.Bxb7! threatening 21.Bxa8 and 21.Bc6.  Either way, Black might have come close to tossing in the sponge!  ",
        "19... Qe6 20. Qd1": "I would have preferred to develop by 20.Bb2, which also protects the vital points against invasion.  But the text is OK: White has a winning plus.",
        "20... Qe7": "Rather a puzzling move at first sight.  Maybe Black wanted to protect the b-pawn without discommoding the rooks.",
        "21. Nf3 Bxd3": "(?) A third wave of attack!  Surely Black can't get away with this?   After 22.Kxd3 Rc8 23.Bb2 Qe4ch 24.Kd2 or 22...Qe4ch 23.Kd2  and Black has no further attack?  ",
        "22. Re1": "White smells a large and hairy rat.  This move is fine, though 22.Kxd3 is perfectly playable.",
        "22... Be4 23. Nh4": "Opening up a nasty attack on the pinned bishop.  Sure, Black can keep from losing material, but the ensuing exchanges won't help his cause...",
        "23... d5 24. Bxe4": "Possibly overhasty, though, again, it doesn't compromise the win.  Another approach is 24.f3 Qg5ch 25.f5 (forced, but good enough) 25...Qf6 26.Bxe4.  Very like the game continuation, but White keeps his extra two pieces.",
        "24... dxe4 25. Nf5": "(??) A simple oversight that hands back one of the extra pieces, thus halving White's advantage.  White ought still to win, but Black is back. The central pawn-couple proves to be the front line of Black's counterplay for the next phase of the game.",
        "25... Qg5+ 26. Ke2 d3+": "I'd also give more than a passing glance at 26...Qxf5 at once.  The d-pawn is safe enough.  If 27.Qxd4?? Qf3 secures a draw after 28.Kf1 Qh1ch etc.  ",
        "27. Kf1 Qxf5 28. Be3": "A good post for the bishop.  Black's pawn centre is imposing, but White ought to be able to contain them whilst mobilising his Q-side majority.  But Black is not yet without resource...",
        "28... Red8": "Another approach is 28...Qh3ch, which leads to a dangerous looking attack after 29.Kg1 Re5 30.f3 Rh5 31.Ra2 Rxa3!.  But after the spectacular 32.Qb3!! Black's attack peters out 32...Rxa2 33.Qxa2 ... ",
        "29. Ra2 Rd5 30. Rd2": "(?!) Very strange.  I can only surmise that White hoped to make capital out of mating threats once the rook left the back rank. ",
        "30... Rxa3": "(!) Now Black has his final reserves in action...",
        "31. Qc1 Qh3+ 32. Kg1 Rh5 33. f4": "(?!) Black's attack has after all developed in much the same way as given in my note to Black's 28th move.  With 33.f3! White contains Black's attack in the same way as the text move, but with the added feature of attacking Black's centre.  If 33...exf3?? simply 34.Qxa3 wins out of hand.",
        "33... Ra4": "Possibly hoping White has overlooked the protection on c8: 34.Qc8ch?? Qxc8.  But ...Ra8 at once saves time.",
        "34. Ree2": "(?!) Another ingenious move (34...dxe2?? 35.Rd8#, and setting up a strong protection along the 2nd rank), but I much prefer the consolidating 34.Bc5 here.  34.Qc7 doesn't look too bad either!",
        "34... Ra8 35. Reg2 Qc8": "There's nothing doing on the h-file any more, so Black regroups.  But offering Q exchanges looks counterintuitive.  White still has a marked advantage that would have only been enhanced by 36.Qxc8ch Rxc8 37.Bc5!  Instead 35...Rc8 seems to be indicated.",
        "36. Bc5": "Queen exchanges ought to have come first, but the text doesn't really hurt White's game...",
        "36... Rd5 37. Rda2": "37.Qc4 looks an attractive possibility, but retribution is swift: 37...e3! 38.Qxd5?? Ra1ch ...  With the text move, it appears that yet another Black assault has been beaten back.  ",
        "37... Rb8 38. Ra5 Qd7 39. Be3 Rxa5": "Ordinarily, one imagines that Black would prefer not to exchange rooks here, but his choices are limited!",
        "40. bxa5 Ra8": "Since his mistake on the 25th move, White has maintained his piece advantage well enough, but he hasn't been able yet to build much on it, except, seemingly to repel successive attacks.  Things look safe enough, but this is where one needs to be on the alert!",
        "41. Bd2": "(?!) Protects the a-pawn, but shuts the rook off from the Q-side.  41.Ra2 seems preferable here.",
        "41... Qd4+ 42. Kh1 Re8 43. Be3": "Just about forced, but it will do.  White can not allow those centre pawns to advance at all.",
        "43... Qd7 44. Qd2 Rc8": "Black has conjured up another attack, though it's more of a long range bombardment for the moment.  No doubt 45.Qb4 would keep Black contained, but...",
        "45. Rg1": "(??) ",
        "45... Rc2": "(!) At a stroke, White's advantage disappears!",
        "46. Qd1 Qh3": "(!) In a flash Black is once again at White's throat.  How is the mate to be averted?",
        "47. Qxc2": "(!) Panic ... or brilliance?  The alternative, 47.Bd2 leads to an exciting, 4-queen finish in which White just holds out: 47...e3! 48.a6! Qc8 49.Qf3! exd2 50.Qxb7 Qd8! 51.a7 Rc1! 52.a8=Q Rxg1ch 53.Kxg1 d1=Qch 54.Kg2 Qe2ch 55.Kg1 Qe3ch 56.Kg2 (=).  The astonishing text move is no worse, and is probably better!",
        "47... dxc2 48. a6": "(!) A fine diversion.  Black has to break off his attack.",
        "48... Qd7": "(!) Not bad: retaining attacking chances down the d-file.  An alternative was 48...Qg4, after which White might have to settle for the draw after all: 49.a7 (or axb7) ...Qf3ch 50.Rg2 Qd1ch 51.Bg1 h6 52.a8=Qch Kh7 53.Qxb7 c1=Q 54.Qxe4ch etc.",
        "49. axb7": "(??) No-o-o! A tragedy.  It stood to reason that 49.a7 would commit the queen to passive defence for a long time to come, whereupon White ought to be able to round up the c-pawn: 49.a7 Qd8 50.Kg2 (Black can draw after 50.Rc1? Qd1ch! 51.Kg2 Qf3ch etc.) 50...h6 51.Rc1 ",
        "49... Qxb7 50. Rc1 Qd5": "Centralising the queen.  Black has at last a sizeable material plus, but the game is not yet a \"gimme\".  With 51.Kg2 White could present Black with some intersting technical difficulties to overcome.  But White cuts to the chase:",
        "51. Ra1": "(??) Ouch!  Was he tempted by the non-existent mate threat?",
        "51... Qd1+": "0-1.  An epic game!"
