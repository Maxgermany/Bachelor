        "1. e4": "Last night's game in the Oxford & Didtrict League's knockout competition, the Frank Wood Shield.  We got a strange position out of the opening, after which White applied some pressure for a while but eventually cracked under time pressure.  There's a rather comical ending too ...",
        "1... c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 e6 4. Nc3 a6 5. d4 b5": "!? Normally, when faced with a later d4 than usual, I try to transpose into a\nnormal open Sicilian but this time I decided to embarrass her bishop first,\noffering the opportunity to swap a piece for two pawns, creating remote passed\npawns as compensation.",
        "6. Nxb5": "?! She took the bait.  I'm not sure she gets sufficient compensation.  If she\ndoes, she didn't exploit it effectively ...",
        "6... axb5 7. Bxb5+ Bd7 8. Bxd7+ Nxd7": "Now Black's position looks very odd: wide open spaces on the Q-side and a\ncompletely undeveloped kingside.  I had to think hard over the next few moves\nto manage my development while avoiding threats and traps.",
        "9. O-O cxd4": "Although I wanted to get my minor pieces out quickly, I couldn't find a safe\nway to do so immediately.  I was worried about 9...Ngf6 10. e5 dxe5 11. dxe5,\nwhen I'd have to move the attacked N again.  Swapping now on d4 reduced that\nrisk but gave my opponent a second remote passed pawn and allowed her N to take\nup a threatening position, with c6 undefended allowing further disruption.",
        "10. Nxd4 Ngf6 11. Qe2": "This surprised me as I'd been concentrating on how I would respond to 11. Qf3\nor 11. f4 or 11. Bg5.  It seemed solid enough but didn't seem to threaten to\ndisrupt my development.",
        "11... g6": "However, on further consideration, I decided that I couldn't proceed as\noriginally planned by playing  ...Be7 because of the unpleasant fork from c6.\nOnce my Q moved, he could just swap N for B and leave my K stuck on e7.",
        "12. Bg5 Bg7 13. c3": "Another surprise: rather a timid looking move when I'd been expecting\naggression, though it looks more logical from White's viewpoint than it did\nfrom where I sat.",
        "13... O-O": "Development completed without too much disruption.  Now I expected to be\npreoccupied with stalling a queenside pawn storm ...",
        "14. Qe3": "Apparently preparing to swap her active B for my inactive, fianchettoed B,\nsomething I wouldn't have minded as I couldn't see a convincing follow-up for\nher.",
        "14... Rc8": "Played mainly to prevent her N from coming to c6.  A quick look at the\nscoresheet and clocks enabled me to work out at this stage that I had moved\nfaster than a move a minute, whereas she had been averaging 3 minutes a move.\nIt was comforting to know that I would have plenty of time to plan my defence\nand counter-attack.",
        "15. Nb5": "Attacking the pawn on d6.",
        "15... Ne5": "A triple purpose move, enabling my Q to defend d6, preparing to harrass her Q\nfrom c4 or g4, and blockading White's e-pawn.",
        "16. b3": "Preventing the more annoying option and perhaps commencing the pawn storm?",
        "16... Qd7": "Attacking her N and unpinning the Nf6",
        "17. c4": "Establishing a late form of the Maroczy Bind, which pegs my pawns back for  the\nrest of the middle game.",
        "17... Nfg4": "Attacking her Q and preparing to open up the long diagonal, possibly combined\nwith a check with ...Ne5-f3 at some point.",
        "18. Qa7": "Not entirely unexpected.  Swapping Qs at this point would have removed the\nlynchpin of my defence and prepared the ground for the pawn advance.",
        "18... Qc6": "So I side-stepped the swap, improving my Q's position and threatening her pawn\non e4.",
        "19. f3 Nf6 20. Rfd1": "Now my initial thought was to defend the pawn with 20 ...Ne8 but then 21. Be7\nwins the exchange.",
        "20... Rca8": "Now I hoped White would proceed with the capture on d6, apparently winning a\npawn but 21. Rxd6 Rxa7 22. Rxc6 Nxc6 23. Nxa7 Nxa7 woul have lost a piece for\nthe pawn.",
        "21. Qe3 Rfd8": "Activating the KR and starting to prepare either further defence of d6 or an\neventual advance to d5.",
        "22. a4": "Here it comes ...",
        "22... Rd7": "Before I can further reinforce d6, I have to unpin that N again.  This also\nprepares doubling of rooks somewhere.",
        "23. Ra2": "I'd expected Rd2 followed by Rad1 but this looks like it will achieve the same\nend while also getting the R off the long diagonal earlier.  Or perhaps White\nwas planning doubling on the a-file?",
        "23... Ne8": "Nimzowitzchian over-defence of d6 with a view to freeing up the Q or Rd7 for\nother duties and also intending to push that pesky B away.",
        "24. h3": "A mysterious waiting move ... Or perhaps she was planning f4 and didn't want my\nN jumping to g4",
        "24... f6 25. Bh4 g5": "Inviting another swap of B for 2 pawns but this time she declined ...",
        "26. Bf2": "Now all her pieces are in position to support the Q-side pawn storm.",
        "26... Nc7": "Offering to exchange my inactive N for her active N on its lovely outpost.",
        "27. Nxc7": "I think maybe she should have allowed me to take on b5, when, although she\nwould have had doubled b-pawns, one of them would already be advancing into my\nterritory and threatening my Q at the same time.",
        "27... Qxc7 28. Qb6 Bf8": "The long diagonal no longer seemed as important as defending d6 and preparing\nto prevent pawns from queening.  I didn't see any point in avoiding swapping Qs\nnow, as I felt that my extra piece could prevent the pawns from going all the\nway.",
        "29. Qxc7 Rxc7 30. Rb2": "My opponent offered a draw with this move.  I took a quick tour around the room to assess the state of the other games.  One had already been agreed drawn and the rest all appeared very unclear, so it was incumbent on me to push for a win if I could.  I felt that, with my extra material and time on the clock, I ought to be able to push for a win, so played on.",
        "30... Rb8": "Pinning the backward b-pawn, so threatening to win the c-pawn.",
        "31. Rdb1 Rcb7 32. b4": "? Loses the c-pawn for no compensation, but the pin was still theatening to win\nit anyway.  However, White could have played 32. Bd4, providing extra defence\nfor the Rb2 and threatening to swap on e5, resulting in Black getting doubled\npawns.",
        "32... Nxc4 33. Ra2": "Now White totally loses control and it's merely a matter of time before Black\nwins.",
        "33... Rb7xb4 34. Rxb4 Rxb4 35. Be1 Rb3": "Before choosing this method of restraining the pawn (getting behind it and\nswapping rooks) I had to calculate that her pawn couldn't get to the line\nwithout being stopped by my N.",
        "36. a5 Ra3 37. Rxa3 Nxa3 38. a6 Nb5 39. Bf2 Nc7": "As planned.  The N will successfully prevent White from queening on the white\nsquare, which can't be supported by her black-squared B.",
        "40. Bb6": "?? Just gives the pawn away.  Advancing it to a7 would at least have made me work\nto capture it.",
        "40... Nxa6 41. Kf2 d5 42. exd5 Bc5+ 43. Bxc5 Nxc5 44. d6": "Around about here, White passed the 5 minutes left barrier and stopped\nrecording her moves.  I had about 18 minutes left.",
        "44... Kf8 45. Ke3 Ke8 46. g3 Kd7 47. h4 gxh4 48. gxh4 h5 49. f4 Kxd6 50. f5 Ke5": "I felt that this was preferable to capturing immediately on f5, when my doubled\npawns would have been awkward.",
        "51. Kf3 Kxf5 52. Ke3": "White makes no attempt to defend her last pawn but doesn't resign.  Will I\nallow her to stalemate herself?",
        "52... Kg4 53. Kf2 Kxh4 54. Kf3 e5 55. Ke3 Kg3 56. Ke2 Kg2 57. Ke3 h4 58. Ke2 h3 59. Kd2 h2 60. Kc3 h1=Q 61. Kc4 Qg1 62. Kd5": "Now the simplest method would have been to queen another pawn and deliver a\nstraightforward mate with 2 queens but, with 12 minutes left on my clock, I\ndecided to see if I could do it more economically.  I elicited several puzzled\nlooks from onlookers as I fiddled around with Q and N before bringing up my K\nto tighten the noose.",
        "62... Qd4+ 63. Kc6 Ne6 64. Kb5 Qc5+ 65. Ka6 Nc7+ 66. Kb7 Kf3 67. Kb8 Na6+ 68. Ka8 Ke4 69. Kb7 Kd5": "? An oversight as 70. Kxa6 Kc6 would have been stalemate. I would have had to\nplay 70...Qb4 and only then bring up the K.  On the other had, you could argue\nthat the N was more of a distraction and hindrance than an advantage at this\nstage.",
        "70. Ka8": "I don't know whether she'd noticed that the N was en prise or not.",
        "70... Qa3 71. Kb7 Kd6 72. Ka7 Nc5+ 73. Kb6 Qa6#": "In the end, quite a pretty mate... I still had 8 minutes left, she about 3."
