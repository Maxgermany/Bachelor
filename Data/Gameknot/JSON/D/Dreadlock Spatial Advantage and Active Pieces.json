    "moves": {
        "1. e4 e6": "The French Defense. Viewed by many to be dull(as in the exchange variation), it actually leads to sharp and tactical positions; the Winawer, for example.",
        "2. d4": "2. d3 leads to a rather closed position: 2...d5 3. Nd2(3. Qe2 Nf6 4. Nf3 Be7 5. g3 0-0 6. Bg2 c5 when Black has a sturdy and dynamic position)3...Nf6 4. Ngf3 b6 5. c3 c5!? 6. Qa4+!? Qd7 7. Qc2 Qc7 8. Be2 Nc6. This move is probably the best move in the position, and the most natural.",
        "2... d6": "? 2...d5 is the best continuation. Now White has a strong sturdy center while Black has nothing to show for it. ",
        "3. Nc3 a6": "? Another bad move. 3...Nf6 should be tried, though after 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bd3 Be7 6. Qe2!? 0-0 7. e5 dxe5 8. dxe5 Nd5 9. h4 f5? 10. exf6 e.p gxf6 11. Ng5! fxg5 12. hxg5 Rf7 13. Qh5 Nxc3 14. bxc3 Qd5 15. Bxh7+ Kf8 16. Bg6 Black is going down in flames from Gampe-Kaulfuss, Bundesliga 2002.",
        "4. Nf3 h6": "??! This is taking things too far. 4...b5 would have been the right choice, going for things on the queenside.",
        "5. Be3": "A reasonable developing move. Also good would have been 5. Bf4, though I didn't want my bishop to be too vulnerable on that square. ",
        "5... b5": "Only now does Black get things going for him on the queenside. In effect, he has not developed any pieces at all, while White has the pawn center and three pieces developed vs none.\n\nDevelopment and center vs moving pawns all around= White has a advantage.",
        "6. Qd2": "Another interesting move would have been 6. a4!? cracking the Black pawn structure on the queenside: 6...b4 7. Nb1 Nf6 8. Bd3 then Qd2 looks attractive. I was aware of this but first wanted to castle.\n",
        "6... Nd7": "Better than 6...Nc6 when his bishop would be blocked when it came to b7.",
        "7. d5": "One of my first spatial gains: FIRST: White locks the center, and claims c6 and d5. Black will likely respond e5, when White can try for a pawn break like f2-f4.",
        "7... e5 8. a4": "And now I want more space on the queenside. Also possible was 0-0-0. ",
        "8... bxa4": "He takes the pawn, turning the a6 pawn into a weakness. Note that the c6 square is a serious hole in Black's position. ",
        "9. Nxa4": "This move is more flexible than Rxa4, because it prepares the advances: b4, c4, and then c5. After White makes these advances and solidifies it, it will be clear that he dominates the center and the queenside.",
        "9... Ngf6 10. Bd3 Ng4": "He wants his knight for the bishop, though the knights are stronger than bishops in this kind of position. Still, this trades off a supporter of the c5 square, the one where White desperately wants a white pawn on. ",
        "11. Ke2": "? I didn't need to do this; 0-0 was fine.  ",
        "11... Nxe3 12. Qxe3 Be7 13. b4 Nb6": "Black obviously wants to trade pieces and go into a endgame. This would be bad for White to trade pieces, because trading pieces in a cramped position is good for the defender. So I avoid Nxb6, also because the c3-c4-c5 advance would be much harder to make.",
        "14. Nb2 Bb7": "Black cannot make the advance c6 happen yet because his a6 pawn would be hanging. This is a idea in the future, though. ",
        "15. Rhc1 O-O 16. c4 Bg5": "(!?) This attempts to trade off the knight for the bishop, and I must take. ",
        "17. Nxg5 hxg5 18. c5": "And meanwhile I have a clear advantage on the queenside.",
        "18... Nxd5": "!? I was impressed by this move; Black attempts to get active pieces for some material; the question is whether this is enough or not. In my opinion it is not, though it takes some good play by White. Anyway, this is a good pyschological decision; he's not going to sit hopelessly and get squashed! ",
        "19. exd5 Bxd5 20. cxd6 Qxd6 21. f3": "(?) Hard to say how I could have missed 21. Qc5! Qxc5 22. Rxc5 c6 23. Rxa6 and Black will lose a huge amount of material. ",
        "21... g4": "!",
        "22. Rc2": "Again, I am not aware at all of my opponent's threat...",
        "22... e4": "!! The point is that the queen and king are lined up on the same file, this is why 0-0 would have worked better. Black's position is now preferable.",
        "23. Bxe4": "? Panicking...",
        "23... Rfe8 24. Kf2 f5 25. Qc5 fxe4 26. Qxd6 cxd6 27. fxg4": "And the smoke has cleared and a inferior endgame for White has arrived, though he managed to hold it.",
        "27... e3+": "Black's e-pawn is a thing to be reckoned with: Passed pawns must be pushed.",
        "28. Ke1": "! The best defense. ",
        "28... Re4 29. Nd3 Rxg4 30. b5": "Active defense. I'll give the rest of the endgame with no notes, and leave the readers of this annotation to comment.",
        "30... Rxg2 31. Rxg2 Bxg2 32. Rxa6 Rxa6 33. bxa6 d5 34. a7 d4 35. Nf4 Be4 36. Ne6 Kf7 37. Nc7 Kf6 38. a8=Q Bxa8 39. Nxa8 Ke5 40. Nb6 Ke4 41. Nc4 d3 42. Nd6+ Kd5 43. Nf5 Ke4 44. Nd6+ Kd5 45. Nf5 e2 46. Ng3": "! Not falling for 46. Nxg7 Ke4! 47. Ne6 Ke3 48. Ng5 d2#.",
        "46... Ke5 47. Nxe2 dxe2 48. Kxe2 Kf4 49. Kf2 g5 50. Kg2 Kg4 51. h3+ Kf4 52. h4 g4 53. h5 Kg5 54. Kf2": "And that's it, folks! Many thanks to this exciting game, and g'day! Comments are greatly appreciated."
