        "6... a5": "The exchange favours me, but white...",
        "7. a3": "Losing the initiative with Be7 is out of question, so... ",
        "7... Bxd2+ 8. Qxd2 Ne4": "White has to keep guard of d4, and if Qd3, Bf5 has a threat (Ng3). ",
        "9. Qd1": "Pressure, pressure, pressure... ",
        "9... Qf6": "Easy to parry, but still very good. I keep an eye on d4, now pinned against b2. ",
        "10. Nf3": "Better than f3?? Qh4+, g3, Nxg3.",
        "10... O-O": "? g5 at once keeps the pressure on. ",
        "11. Be2": "if white castles, I'll have it much more difficult. I don't care about my K this time, I have to attack. ",
        "11... g5": "...starting a tactic mel\u00e9e that will come over later. ",
        "12. Bd3": "A typical novice mistake. o-o and Ne5 would do much better. ",
        "12... Nxf2": "Let's party!",
        "13. Kxf2 g4": "I'll recover the piece, for sure, and white is not castled! And now, d4 will become vulnerable. ",
        "14. Rf1": "The idea is to win a tempo over the Q after the way clears... and to start a pressure on the f column. ",
        "14... gxf3 15. Kg1": "Aha... you wan a tempo, but you didn't see mine: ",
        "15... Qxd4+": "White seems crushed, but... one never wins until the end. See my last game!",
        "16. Kh1": "I'm not sure of my next move. Take it that white has Bxh7+ and wins my Q, so f2 was not an option. I didn't see qxb2, but Nd2 and white holds a little more. No risks.",
        "16... fxg2+ 17. Kxg2 Qh4": "This seemed to me a good square for my Q. I have to be very careful now, since the position is very easy for tactics, and I miss a tempo to move my K to h8... safely. I am only +1, so I didn't win yet. ",
        "18. Qf3": "Threatening b7. I'm glad to leave it to him, but now if I play Kh8, Qf6+ exchanges Q with no further advantage for me. ",
        "18... Nd7": "! Covering f6. If Qxb7, Rb8, and then Rxb2+ wins. It threatens a \"fork\" on e5. A good \"quiet move\". ",
        "19. Nc3": "White's quiet move is not so good!",
        "19... Ne5 20. Qe2": "White could have played Qg3+, exchanging Q and get a playable endgame. I lost the chance to play Ng4 here, forcing Rh1. ",
        "20... Bh3+": "Now, I start cashing in. ",
        "21. Kh1": "BxR is there, but... would it be all? I looked hard, but black has Rg1+ and I see no point in allowing it. Probably, white has some mate net if I get wrong, so...",
        "21... Nxd3": "This B was my headache. ",
        "22. Qxd3 Bxf1 23. Rxf1": "It was not the better outcome I could have organized, but I'm still and exchange up. An unactive R waits for his moment. ",
        "23... Kh8": "Now I can, finally, play the K there ",
        "24. Nd5": "NO matter, white, you're doomed. ",
        "24... Rae8 25. Qc3+": "...or not! I allowed him to pressure f6 too much. Still, I have a way out of this. Can you see it?",
        "25... f6": "It seems bad, because I can't defend it. But I have a \"small\" conterattack... bsed on Qe5+ and Rg8+...",
        "26. Rf4": "Stopped this one, but...",
