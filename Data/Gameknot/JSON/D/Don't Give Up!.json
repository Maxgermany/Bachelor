        "6... h6": "? A waste of a move, I wouldn't have wanted to play Bg5, so black was better off developing.",

        "25. Qxb7+": "At one point, around move 19, I was going to resign, I think that's why I did Qd2, because I felt like resigning, I was unconfident and didn't really care about my move, so never give up, always go till the end!! It's not over until it IS over."
