        "1... Nf6": "No surprise here",
        "2. c4": "I continue",
        "2... g6": "So is he going to a King's Indian or maybe an Grunfeld Defence?",
        "3. Nc3": "I continue",
        "3... c6": "What is this? Maybe he will follow up with d6, going back to main lines?",
        "4. e4": "So I take the centre",
        "4... d5": "So this is what he planned. He was about 20 minutes for the match. I spent that on working out the best reply to this, over the next few moves, I moved a lot slower, so by move 10 we were more or less level in time",
        "5. e5": "I found out later on the Gameknot Opening Databases, this was played in the 2 games on the database of world matches.",
        "5... Ne4": "This is more or less forced. Now of those two games, Kasparov, Garry (2800) vs. Kamsky, Gata (2640) continued with Bd3 and white won. After the game my opponent said he felt that he felt this was the strongest continuation for white, but I am not convinced. The other game continued with Be3 and ended in a draw, - Kurhinen Boris (2140) vs. Timchenko Aleks\u2026 (2100) I chose another move, which looks quite logical",
        "6. Nxe4": "This was played in 3 Gameknot games",
        "6... dxe4": "He naturally takes back. Now on Gameknot database, there are three games from this position, g3 ended \u00bd-\u00bd iin tesomator (1824) vs. vandy (1939)\nf3 ended 1-0 in old_kondor (1835) vs. super-tee (1673)\nBe3 ended 0-1 vicit (1824) vs. watbot3000 (1705)\n",
        "7. Be3": "My first ideas were to play this followed by Qc2, with the idea of not allowing him to play Bf5 followed by e4-e3, but I changed my mind....",
        "7... Bg7": "He continues development.",
        "8. Qd2": "With dreams of a king side attack. The other game ended with 8.\tQc2\tBf5\n9.\tNe2\tc5 10.\tO-O-O\tNc6 11.\tdxc5\tQa5 12.\tb3\tNb4 13.\tQb2\tNd3+ 14.\tRxd3\texd3 15.\tNg3\tQe1#. Very weak play by white!",

        "13. Qd2": "Mine comes back",
        "13... Qxd2+": "He takes",
        "14. Kxd2": "I take back. Now I think I have a very slight edge, because of his doubled pawns. but he has slightly better development.",
        "14... a5": "This was a surprise, he gains c5 for this knight, but I am not convinced it is better than Ne5",
        "15. Ne2": "So my knight comes out",
        "15... Nc5": "He continues",
        "16. Nc3": "My knight protects e4",
        "16... f5": "I was quite pleased with this, it reduces the scope of his Bc8",
        "17. Be2": "My bishop comes out",
        "17... e6": "He hits my pawn d6. After a long think I played",
        "18. d6": "This looks very weak, but I couldn' see how he could actually win it without giving me a pawn back somewhere. Besides, I have a plan to support it with b3, a3, b4 and c5",
        "18... Bd7": "Instead of going after the pawn he mobilises his bishop to a better square",
        "19. Kc2": "I want to be able to protect the pawn d6 with a rook down the d file. I also protect b3, preparing my plan.",

        "24... Nd3": "This is forced.",
        "25. b5": "I drive his bishop back. ",
        "25... Be8": "He retreats. I had a long think here. f3 is possible, and strong, but I felt it better to go into a Knight v Bishop ending.",
        "26. Bxd3": "So I take",
        "26... exd3+": "He takes",
        "27. Kxd3": "I take back",
        "27... Rxd6+": "He takes",
        "28. Ke3": "I centralise my king",
        "28... Rd7": "This surprised me. Why not just e5 to mobilise the king side majority with e5?",
        "29. f4": "Now his Be8 is in danger of becoming a \"bad bishop\"",

        "34. Rd1": "Which I do",
        "34... Rxd1": "So he takes",
        "35. Nxd1": "I take back",
        "35... Kc7": "He stops my king advance",
        "36. Nc3": "This may be a mistake. Maybe N-b2-d3-e5 is better. What do you think dear reader?",
        "36... h6": "He tries to put some pawns on black squares",
        "37. h4": "Which I stop",
        "37... b6+": "He checks",
        "38. Kd4": "King retreats",
        "38... Kd6": "His king stops me coming in.",
        "39. Na4": "But now he las to lose material, his king can't protect b6 and stop my king advancing. He finds the best way to lose material",
        "39... e5+": "So he sacs a pawn",
        "40. fxe5+": "I take",
        "40... Kc7": "Now he protects b6",
        "41. Nc3": "So my knight re-positions itself",
