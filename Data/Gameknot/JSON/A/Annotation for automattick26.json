        "1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Nb6 5. f4": "Alekhine's Defense, the four pawns attack.",
        "5... dxe5 6. fxe5 f6": "?!  More traditional lines are 6. ... c5 or 6. ... Nc6.  I think after 7. Nf3 Black can run into some problems; if Black trades he will allow White to develop his Knight.  Also, e6 is now dangerously weak.  Some of the traditional problems of moving the f pawn (weakening the King's position) are, however, diminshed since White has already opened the f file.",
        "7. exf6": "?  As I said, I would have played Nf3.",
        "7... exf6 8. c5": "?  I don't much care for lots of pawn shuffling.",
        "8... Nd5 9. Bc4": "?  An empty threat, since if Bxd5 Qxd5 then White has the additional liability of guarding g2.",
        "9... c6": "?  As with the previous comment, I don't think this move is necessary.  ... b6 seems preferrable, since it threatens White's overextended pawns and might let your Bishop into the long diagonal.  Be7 also seems worth considering, allowing you to castle.",
        "10. Qe2+": "Considerably better than Qh5 .",
        "10... Qe7": "?  Allowing your c pawn to be isolated.",
        "11. Qxe7+ Bxe7 12. Bxd5 cxd5 13. Nc3 Be6 14. Bf4 g5 15. Bxb8": "?  White is wasting moves.",
        "15... Rxb8 16. Nge2 Bf7": "Castling seems preferrable here.",
        "17. O-O O-O 18. Rae1 Rfc8": "I'm not great with this position, but the principles that would have guided my play here are basically as follows: move pawns to control central space (and limit his knights); use your Rooks to move pawns and control open files; get your Bishops off of the defense.  Especially with the last point, it is regrettable that neither of your Bishops can move without giving up pawns.  So I would probably have recommended Kg7, Rfe8, or b5 before Rfc8.  After all, with a defended White pawn in the c file, where can your Rook go?",
        "19. Ng3 Kf8": "?  Where is the King going?",
        "20. Nf5 Bd8 21. Nh6 Bg6": "Not that your move necessarily has any problems with it, but I would have tried Be8 so that after Nxd5 you can play Bc6 and have a good position for one Bishop.  As it is, he covers an empty diagonal.",
        "22. Nxd5 b6": "Ignoring the attack on f6, but with the line played, the attack on f6 will lose material for White.",
        "23. Nxf6 Bxf6 24. Rxf6+ Kg7": "!",
        "25. Ng4 Rc7": "?? Bh5! and White has serious trouble.",
        "26. cxb6 axb6 27. b4 Rf8": "?  Giving up the pawn.  With White having three passed pawns on the queenside, the game is probably technically lost.",
        "28. Rxb6 Rc4 29. d5": "?  This move gives you good drawing chances.  White's best bet was to follow Tarrasch's rule and play Rd1 (Rook behind a passed pawn).",
        "29... Rxg4 30. h3": "??  Again, Rd1 is clearly best.",
        "30... Rd4 31. d6 Rd8 32. Rb7+ Kh6": "Hopefuly inodowman or some other good egg like him will come along and tell me if this is a boneheaded plan (I'm terrible about moving my King out early), but I think Kf6 was the move here.  With so many pieces gone, King activity becomes an important marker of progress, and a King wedged into the h file is a liability, and blocks your h pawn.",
        "33. d7": "?",
        "33... Rd8xd7 34. Rxd7 Rxd7 35. b5 Rb7 36. a4 Bc2": "?  Bd3 seems preferrable; I think this only forces Ra1 (and you don't really want the White Rook behind his passed pawns).  With Bd3, you have fighting chances at wedging the Bishop in front of one pawn and holding the line that way, freeing your Rook for bigger and better things.",
        "37. Ra1 Ra7": "?  Again, I think moving the King is important here.  Ra7 doesn't seem to accomplish much.  The same is true with several of the coming moves; rather than stopping White's advance they gradually give critical space and cause Black trouble.",
        "38. a5": "?  Wasn't b6 better?  If ... Rxa4 then 39. Rxa4 Bxa4 40. b7 and White can crown.",
        "38... Bd3 39. b6 Ra8 40. b7 Rb8 41. a6 Be4": "??  Bxa6 was necessary here.  White is guaranteed crowning otherwise.",
        "42. Kf2": "??  a7 and White gets a Queen, or at least goes up the exchange after 42. a7 Rxb7 43. a8=Q Rb1  44. Rxb1 Bxa8.",
        "42... Bxb7 43. axb7 Rxb7": "I think from here the position ought to be a draw.",
        "44. Kf3 Kh5 45. Ra4 Rb3+ 46. Kf2 Rb2+ 47. Kg1 h6 48. Kh2 Kg6 49. Ra8 Rb4 50. g4 h5 51. Ra6+ Kh7 52. gxh5": "?  What chances White may have had went away here.  A pawn in the h file is not to impossible to rown if the enemy King stands between it and the crowning square, given otherwise equal material.  More pawns in the h file makes little difference.",
        "52... Rh4 53. Kg3 Kg7": "?  Why not Rxh5?",
        "54. Rg6+ Kh7 55. Rxg5 Re4 56. Rf5 Re7 57. Kg4 Re4+ 58. Kg5 Re7 59. h6 Rd7 60. h4 Re7 61. h5 Rd7 62. Rc5 Re7 63. Kf6 Rb7 64. Kg5 Rd7 65. Rc6 Rb7 66. Rg6 Rb5+ 67. Kh4 Rb4+ 68. Kg5 Rb5+ 69. Kh4 Rb4+ 70. Kg3 Rb3+ 71. Kf4 Rb4+ 72. Ke3 Rh4 73. Kf3 Rxh5": "Of course, if your opponent hasn't recognized yet that it must be a draw, then vacuuming up the pawns is a good way to force it. =)  You got in some hot water by being down all of those passed pawns, and again by letting them advance so far, but generally you played well.  Just watch for traps (like 25. ... Bh5!) and try to find general principles about Rook placement and pawn maneuvering that will give you more consistent play.  After all, you've been in the 1500s before and for good reason.",
