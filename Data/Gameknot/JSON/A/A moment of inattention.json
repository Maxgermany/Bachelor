    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5": "A sicilian defense. Most popular.",
        "2. Nf3": "White goes probably for the open sicilian. ",
        "2... d6 3. Bc4": "Nothing wrong, but I expected d4. @slywing the realms of the sicilian defense are huge, and Bc4 is a extreemely common move in many open and closed sicilians. the move e6, in many cases, can be broken down by some pawn thrusts, or with a piece sac. Also, e6 restricts piece mobility, with the light bishop. If white wants to , he can go into a open siclian, and the d6 pawn will be left weak and unable to advance in many cases.",
        "3... h6": "It would be wrong to label this move as just 'bad', but I would never play it because it just wastes time.@slywing but this is not nearly enough to lose a game, even at the grandmasters level. White could probably get a edge in a masters game. I would like to see some of the strongest players on this site get a real advantage from this small move agianst good play. It is not too critical.",
        "4. h3 Nf6": "Black develops a piece. The position is about =. White looks better. ",
        "5. d3": "Supporting the pawn. White's other option was Nc3, where the move d4 could be played quickly. Would anyone consider advancing or sacrificing the pawn with a move like 0-0?@slywing yes, I would probably choose Nc3 personally, and head for an open position. The knight is probably going there anyways if d4 is played. However, if white intended a closed game, which I would prefer not to go to, then d3 is fine. The knight ma head to d2 anytime, or c3.",
        "5... Nc6 6. Bd2": "This square is not optimal for the bishop. The bishop neither looks good nor has an active role at this square. White was probably unsure about where to put the bishop. If he wanted to, he could have pllayed Nc3, and waited for 'signs' of where to put the bishop. ",
        "6... e5": "The advance is awkward, resembling a BOT setup. However, here it is not as good as if the white dark square bishop were fianchettoed. Now the d5 square is a target, and black has no outposts or weak squares to target himself.",
        "7. a3": "Nc3 was better. My strong point in chess are tactics and attack strategy, but closed positions and manuevering give me headaches. this move a3 might have been intended to play b4, getting a little open play and potentially activating the rook. a simple a5 would stop it. All together, b4 idea is not very hopeful.",
        "7... Be7 8. O-O Bxh3": "The first real mistake of the game. Black was doing fine up til now. This is the kind of move to play in general when the position is open, you have a majority of your forces at the kingside, and they are all at their optimal positions. Preferably, the opponent has very few pieces for defense. It can rarely even be played to just gain an initiative. In those positions, this move often gains a decisive ad, even when no tactical finishes are found, these moves force a win. Instead, in closed positions, with no force to back up the sacrifice, and no way to take the initiative, this is the kind of move weak players make, in attempt to 'open the king'. What they are doing is really 'losing a piece'. As the game continues, white's advantage gets bigger. Black probably could have just castled and had a good game. Be6 is even considerable. Anything but this. ",
        "9. gxh3 g5": "Black tries to justify his previous mistake with another attacking move. This weakens his kingside more than it does to white, and he only has 3 pieces out, when none of them can make any immediate action.",
        "10. Nc3 Nd4": "Black hopefully realizes now that he will suffer the rest of the game. Trade pieces when up a lot of material is a good idea. ",
        "11. Nxd4 cxd4 12. Nd5": "This move is good enough, and is probably the best move for the knight. But consider Ne2, with Ng3 and Nf4. That knight will not be exchanged, but it is slow. Im betting Nd5 is the best knight move, but everything should be looked at. ",
        "12... Nxd5 13. Bxd5": "Outposts are not only for knights. The bishop is powerful here, and hits f7.",
        "13... Qb6 14. b4": "Now white plays a good move to hold the pawn. Is the c pawn weak? Probably not. If black concentrates his force on the c pawn, he will be invaded on the light squares. 14...Rc8 15.Qf3(h5) Rxc2 16.Qxf7+ Kd8 17.Ra2 and white will mop up the K side pawns after dealing with some minor nuisances on the Q side. This is just one line. 15.Bc4 is already good enough, with Qh5 coming up. ",
        "14... Qb5": "Black knows he is losing. He has given up on his 'attack' and starts to move on the Q side. It fails.",
        "15. Qh5": "white invades. Qf3 worked as well. The goal is not really to checkmate right now, but to sweep up the loose pawns and cause difficult threats. Trading pieces into a won endgame is easy. ",
        "15... Rh7 16. Kh1": "White can now activate his dark squared bishop now with 16.f4 gxf4 17.B/Rxf4. This is just as good, preping Rg1 with h4, penetrating the black position.",
        "16... Qd7": "The queen is moving without effect. ",
        "17. c4": "Gaining Q side space. A good move.",
        "17... Rb8 18. Rfg1 Qa4 19. Qd1": "repetitive, but white was afraid of counters like Qb3. @gcah. Your analysis is generally correct. Howver, when I gain a huge advantage, I like to skip the rough analysis in positions where my opponent has no tactical threats and only minor nuisances, and get rid of all of them. It takes less brainpower and effort, and can be fairly enjoyable. But your line wins fast.",
        "19... Qd7 20. Qh5": "Now, if i were black, I would almost always play Qa4, repeating the position. In worse positions, you should repeat positions if your opponent does as well, hoping to draw.",
        "20... Qa4 21. Qd1 Qd7 22. b5": "????The true meaning of a blunder! White plays carelessly, not wanting to repeat the position. However, the side effects of the cure are worse than the disease after black's next move. White assumed that Black merely wanted to repeat positions. What he failed tp notice was that Qd7 carried the dealy threat of Qxh3 checkmate! The Qh5 was the only thing preventing that. ",
        "22... Qxh3#": "Sure enough, black plays the checkmate and lets out a sigh of relief while white tears his hair in frustration. White had a massive positional and material ad, while black was completely lost. \nGoing back a few moves, white could have proceeded with Kh2 to safety the pawn and then continue with Qh5 back. Black's position is devoid of plan. The lesson is, whenever you make a move, always check IS IT SAFE TACTCIALLY? \nThe vast majority of players under 1500 USCF/ 1400FIDE rating do not consistently check for tactics, and if the position is tactical, they just might blunder the game in one move. If you are like that, then checking for tactics every move will bring you up a lot. REal positional chess matters little until you are an expert. If someone had the tactical skill of a world champion, but the positional knowledge of a weak club player, they could make it to top 1000 in the nation, probably much better. Once I did this, my rating went up a few hundred points in a few weeks."
