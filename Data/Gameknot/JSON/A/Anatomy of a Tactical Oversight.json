        "1. e4": "We are all taught how to exploit basic tactical conditions that allow us to deliver the knock-out shot in our games.  And we always see these positions from the winner's point of view.  The question I want to pose in this game annotation is the reverse  scenario:  How is it that the losing player - the player who receives the knock-out - allows the conditions for such a tactical shot to arise?  On move 32 Black delivers the tactical shot that, for all intents and purposes, ends the game.  But what were the oversights by the losing player (me) that allowed it?  That is, what is the anatomy of a tactical oversight?",
        "1... d6": "This game was from a Pirc mini-tourney.",
        "2. d4 g6 3. f3": "My preferred move for White.",
        "3... Bg7 4. Be3 Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Ne2 a6 7. Bc4 b5 8. Bd5": "I have no love for the \"two bishops\" especially when one of them has lots of pawns on its own color complex.",
        "8... Nf6 9. Bxc6": "Takes.",
        "9... Bxc6": "Takes.",
        "10. Nd2": "This knight is going to support an expected pawn exchange on c4.  ",
        "10... O-O": "Black is developed.",
        "11. c4": "White tries to open the c-file.  This was my strategic aim throughout the game.",
        "11... bxc4": "Takes.",
        "12. Nxc4": "Takes.",
        "12... Bb5 13. Rc1": "Now White has the c-file.",
        "13... Rb8": "Black is hoping for some action on the b-file, but...",
        "14. b3": "...White has more space to work with in this sector of the board so he defends the b-pawn by simply advancing it one square.  White has no intention of recapturing with it should black take the knight.",
        "14... Bxc4 15. Rxc4": "There.  The c-file is mine and I now bear down on the backward c7 pawn.  So far so good.",
        "15... d5": "Black forces a central pawn exchange.",
        "16. exd5": "Takes.",
        "16... Nxd5": "Takes.",
        "17. Bf2": "This bishop is doing its job for now as a defensive support to my central d-4 pawn.",
        "17... Bh6": "Black tries tactics on the e3 square.",
        "18. O-O": "I ignore any invasion on e3.  Finally my king is tucked away.",
        "18... Be3": "Black was hoping for a re-capture here so as to fork both of white's rooks and his queen with the d5 knight.",
        "19. Qd3": "White supports e3.",
        "19... Bxf2+": "Black takes the defensive bishop off the board.",
        "20. Kxf2": "White takes with the king as taking with the rook was awkward.",
        "20... e6": "This move supports the d5 knight.  Black has his own positional trump now.   This knight is almost immovable and, like an eagle, it has a massive wing span, hitting many of the weak squares in White's camp, (e3 & c3 in particular) and on the queenside (b4 and b6).  It will use these latter squares as pivot points for some nice tactics later on.  ",
        "21. g3": "A queen check at h4 was threatened after which White may as well have resigned.  Good defensive move by White.",
        "21... Qd6": "Going for the weak squares on the queenside (squares a3, b2, etc.)",
        "22. Rfc1": "White ignores any queen voyage to the queen side as the c4 rook has unfettered access to the a-file.  This is enough to repel any invasion by the queen, as will be shown.",
        "22... Nb4": "Forks the queen and the a2 pawn.",
        "23. Qd2": "Defends a2.",
        "23... Nd5": "The knight comes back to its d5 outpost.",
        "24. Nc3": "White tries to challenge black knight's central dominance.",
        "24... c6": "Black supports it further and indicates that any exchange of the knight will entail a repair-job to his queenside pawn structure.",
        "25. Ne4": "White hits the black queen with his knight.  More prudent would have been to get the Black knight off the board.  White is over-playing is hand and trying to play for finesse that has little yield.",
        "25... Qa3": "The queen invades the queenside, but...",
        "26. Ra4": "It is repelled and White wins a pawn.  Now White's advantage appears to be palpable.  But this is the point of the game in which the advantage starts to turn over to Black...",
        "26... Qe7": "The queen retreats, and Whit is suddenly up a pawn after the capture on a6.  ",
        "27. Rxa6": "The a6 pawn falls and White is both up a pawn.  However he is \"cruising for a bruising\".  This pawn capture begins a series of moves in which White's position slowly unravels, leading up to the 32nd move knock-out.  ",
        "27... Nb4": "Black hits the rook with his knight.",
        "28. Ra4": "White brings the rook back, intending, eventually, to re-position it on c4 where it can bear down on the isolated c6 pawn.",
        "28... Rfd8": "Good move - Black logically gets his other rook out, opposite white's queen.  This was a great move to challenge the resiliency of white's position.  The knock-out is slowly approaching, but White, for  some reason, does not detect it.",
        "29. Nc5": "Instead of consolidating his position, White tries for tangential tactics.  Here he tries to cut off communication between the Black knight and the black queen.  Better may have been to simply move the queen to e3. ",
        "29... Nd5": "The knight returns to its d5 outpost.",
        "30. Re1": "The intention was logical:  To simply blockade the advance of the e6 pawn which, white surmised, would undermine the d4 pawn which supported the c5 knight.   However White's position is starting to come apart at the seams.  Simultaneously playing offence one move and defence the next move, White is opening himself up for the decisive shot.   In this position the white Queen is undefended, and the a4 rook  is off sides.  Notice how the centralized d5 knight prevents white from blockading the e pawn with the queen?  The knight controls the e3 square and it threatens a queen-rook fork at c3 should white move his queen to e2.",
        "30... Kg7": "Black wanted to avoid any Qh6 ideas by White.",
        "31. h4": "Another mistake which accounts for the \"anatomy of the tactical oversight\" (move 32).  Instead of bringing his pieces back into contact with one another, White tries for more tangential offence.  The text move was meant to secure g5 for the queen so as to force an exchange of queens at g5 or to mobilize the queen to e5.  ",
        "31... Nb6": "Black rightly sees that White's queen is not protected.  But why did I not see this?  Because I was focused on (1) blockading the e6 pawn; (2) mobilizing the queen to g5; and (3) cutting off the c5 knight from the e7 queen - all great ideas in isolation, but disastrous when combined together!   ",
        "32. Rb4": "In all of my multi-tasking, all I see is the attack on my rook...",
        "32... Qxc5": "Knock-out!  The knight falls and the d2 pawn is pinned on the d-file.",
        "33. dxc5": "Making the most of a bad situation.",
        "33... Rxd2+": "Check!",
        "34. Ke3": "making the most of it...",
        "34... Rxa2": "Takes.  And the rest of the game is a pathetic standing-eight count followed by lots of groggy bleeding.  Congratulations to Gurudela for showing me some valuable lessons relating to why I allowed a solid position to fall victim to a fine, yet clearly observable, tactical shot.  I hope these annotations make sense to the reader.  I am still pondering where I went wrong so please add any comments if you feel inclined.",
