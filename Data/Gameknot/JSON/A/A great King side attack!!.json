        "10... Bxf6 11. Nxd5 Bxb2": "Of course if 11... Qxd5?? then 12. Bxh7 . But here my main intention was to target the black King and the knight was already aiming to e7.",
        "12. Rb1 Qa5+": "Black tries to counter by attacking the queen side. By forcing black to precipitate an attack White is slowing down Black's development. ",
        "13. Nd2": "This is great move. White blocks the check and in the same time opens the diagonal so that later the Queen can attack the Black's King",
        "13... Bc3 14. O-O": "14.O-O! A great move. White gives up the Knight and achieves two things: the King is safe and everything is ready for the onslaught !",
        "14... Bxd2": "A very bad move for Black. Black should have taken measures to protect the King. For example 14... g6.",
        "15. Bxh7+": "15. Bxh7! A big blow.",
        "15... Kh8": "Of course if 15 ...Kxh7 will be mate in two: 16.Qh5  Kg8 17. Ne7  ",
        "16. Qh5": "Now the only defence is for Black to threat the White Queen. Otherwise Bg6 followed by Qh7.",
        "16... Bg4 17. Qh4 Qd8": "The only option.",
        "18. Ne7": "Black is running out of threats. Here I though the only way Black could delay defeat is by sacrificing the Queen with Qxe7.",
        "18... g5 19. Qh6": "Black resigned. Nothing can stop White from mating. Hope you enjoyed."
