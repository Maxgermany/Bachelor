        "1... e5": "He replied e5...",
        "2. Nf3": "Nf3 is typical...",
        "2... d6": "Then he played d6 instead of other more useful movements..",
        "3. Bc4": "I was playing typical...",
        "3... Bd7": "Again worthless move instead of developing some pieces..",
        "4. d3": "d3 to open th black bishop and to protect the e4 pawn...",
        "4... Be7": "He was blocking his queen...An unsafe movement i think....",
        "5. Nc3": "I'm still playing typical...",

        "7... c5": "c5? He's still back in development and he played c5! So I had an easy plan in my mind. The plan is simple...i'd let him took the knight and i'll win the game...Of course he should have prevented that but as i said before he's a low rating player so he might took the chance and risk it...",
        "8. Qf3": "I played the queen in order to checkmated him then...",
        "8... cxd4": "And as i guessed before he took the knight and ignored the checkmate...",
        "9. Qxf7#": "So simple...He forgot to see at his back and at his king's defence...Hope you like it.. Bye and Dag...Haha"
