    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "In this game I was holding DJ for most of the game. Then my greed gets the better of me, I take a poisoned pawn and it is quickly lost.",
        "1... c5": "So I play my usual Sicilian",
        "2. Nf3": "He plays the usual",
        "2... Nc6": "and I follow the main line",
        "3. Nc3": "What is this? is he intending a closed variation after all?",
        "3... d6": "I wait and see",
        "4. d4": "He opts for the open variation",
        "4... cxd4": "I take",
        "5. Nxd4": "He takes back",
        "5... Nf6": "And we reach the usual position",
        "6. Bb5": "This is slightly unusual, Bg5, Bc4 and Be2 are more common",
        "6... Bd7": "I have to defend my knight",
        "7. h3": "This seems a little strange, I'm still not sure why he played it",
        "7... g6": "As he has avoided the sharpest variations such as the Yugoslav attack, I may as well fianchetto my bf8",
        "8. Be3": "He develops",
        "8... Bg7": "I develop",
        "9. O-O": "He castles",
        "9... O-O": "So do I",
        "10. Nf3": "I am not sure why he played this either, he seems to be going backwards. This position has been reached before, but there is no games with Nf3 on the Gameknot World Database, but there is on the database of Gameknot games.",
        "10... a6": "a6 is often a move played in the Open Sicilian. Here I can play it with tempo.",
        "11. Bd3": "He retreats",
        "11... b5": "Qa5 was the move played in the only other game on the Gameknot opening databases (ojdol (2167) vs. janhalpha (2323) - drawn in 32 moves. This move seemed more thematic - pursuing a minority attack against the white queen side.",
        "12. a3": "He prevents b5-b4",
        "12... Na5": "With the idea of coming in to c4 at some stage",
        "13. Qd2": "He doubles up on the diagonal",
        "13... Re8": "I move the rook, so Be3-h6 can be met with Bg7-h8",
        "14. b4": "He hits my knight, but leaves his c pawn backwards on a semi-open file. He does this before I can play Rc8 enabling me to recapture on c4 with the rook",
        "14... Nc4": "So my knight comes in",
        "15. Bxc4": "He takes",
        "15... bxc4": "I take back. Now his weak c2 pawn is shielded by my pawn, but I felt I was doing ok here",
        "16. Bh6": "His bishop flies in",
        "16... Bh8": "Mine retreats, as prepared by Rf8-e8",
        "17. Rad1": "He mobilises a rook",
        "17... Bc6": "I put more pressure on the e pawn.",
        "18. Ng5": "He protects",
        "18... Qc7": "I plan to put my queen on b7 with more pressure on e4",
        "19. Qf4": "His queen comes up",
        "19... Rab8": "I mobilise my Ra8",
        "20. Rd2": "Again, I am not quite sure why he played this",
        "20... Rec8": "I improve the standing of my other rook. Now if I can distract him on the centre and/or queen side his Bh6 may proof to be misplaced.",
        "21. Nd5": "He throws in his knight",
        "21... Bxd5": "So I take",
        "22. exd5": "He takes back",
        "22... c3": "I hit his rook",
        "23. Rd4": "Rook moves of course",
        "23... a5": "I try to do something on the queen side",
        "24. Re1": "He improves the position of his rook. My e pawn is now slightly weak, open to attack down the semi-open e file and unable to move without being taken. Of course e7-e5 at any time will be met with dxe6 en passant.",
        "24... axb4": "So I take",
        "25. axb4": "He takes back",
        "25... Rb5": "I attack the d5 pawn again.",
        "26. Qf3": "He puts another protector on it.",
        "26... Qb7": "and I increase the pressure on d5",
        "27. Rde4": "He gangs up on my e pawn. Of course I can't play Nf6xe4 as he replies Qxf7 mate!",
        "27... Rc7": "So I protect e7",
        "28. Rf4": "What is this? He is leaving the d pawn with only one defender and I have 3 pieces attacking it. Can't he see I can just take on d5?",
        "28... Qxd5": "So I take, but it is a massive mistake, I have missed a clever tactical point",
        "29. Rxf6": "Of course! Now if e7xf6 then Re1-e8 is mate! If Bxf6, then Qxf6!! mates. See http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=105923",
        "29... Qxf3": "So I take",
        "30. Rxf3": "But of course he takes back with the rook, and I am just knight for pawn down",
        "30... f5": "My f7 pawn was attacked by knight and rook, so I had to move it to save it!",
        "31. g4": "At last I see the point of h2-h3!",
        "31... Rxb4": "I take his pawn",
        "32. gxf5": "He takes - he is opening up my king side.",
        "32... Rb8": "I guard my back rank",
        "33. Re6": "Rook comes in now",
        "33... gxf5": "I take",
        "34. Rxf5": "He takes back",
        "34... Bf6": "I prevent Rf5-f7",
        "35. Re3": "His rook comes back",
        "35... Rc5": "I offer an exchange of rooks.",
        "36. Rxc5": "He takes",
        "36... dxc5": "I take back",
        "37. Ne4": "Knight forks my pawns and bishop f6",
        "37... Rb6": "My rook comes up",
        "38. Nxf6+": "He takes",
        "38... Rxf6": "I recapture",
        "39. Bg5": "He hits my rook",
        "39... Rg6": "I pin his bishop",
        "40. Rg3": "He unpins",
        "40... Kf7": "I move my king",
        "41. Be3": "He hits my c pawn, and I have had enough. It is pretty hopeless for black now.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for reading this, please rate it on the start system, and leave a comment or two, so that I know how I am doing with my annotations."
