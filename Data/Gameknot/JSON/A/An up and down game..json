        "15... c6 16. Nh4": "The move i should have played was Nf4, which saves the knight and the rook from getting captured, but since i did not observe well the position, i saw the worst move and played it.",
        "16... Qg5 17. Nf3": "Attacking the queen to make my oponent waste time...",
        "17... Qh6 18. Re4": "I prefered to lose a knight because i was planing an attack on the king after that by using the rook.",
        "18... cxd5 19. Rh4 Qg6 20. Qxd5": "He forgot to save the pawn, which could have meant the difference between wining or losing.",

        "24... Rf7": "Defending mate...",
        "25. exf6 Qxf2+ 26. Kh1 Be3": "The final mistake, he should have played something like d6, which should have protected his king for a longer period of time. I think.",

        "27... Kf8 28. Rxh7+": "A move which leads to a beautiful forced mate. The variations are Bxh6, followed by Rh8#, and the one he played.",
        "28... Ke8 29. Rh8+": "Checkmate after black moves Rf8, I would have played Qxf8# or Rxf8#."
