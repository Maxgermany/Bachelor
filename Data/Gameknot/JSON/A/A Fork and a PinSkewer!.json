        "1. c4": "This is a good example of how a chess game can suddenly change course mid-game. In this game I make two critical mistakes, the second of which quickly lost me the match",
        "1... e5": "Reverse Silican",
        "2. Nc3": "my usual development....",
        "2... Qf6": "and black brings out its queen?!?! a basic rule of chess is to never bring out the queen too early.",
        "3. g3": "preparing to bring my bishop to the long diagonal (I know there's a proper name for this but I forgot how to spell it)",
        "3... Bc5": "Black's plan is clear now; Scholar's Mate. Not a potent attack if the opponent can recognise the danger...",
        "4. Nf3": "as it is easily countered ",
        "4... Nh6": "? that's not usually a good place for a knight... If Black wanted to develop it then Ne7 would be far more preferable",
        "5. Nd5": "attacking, putting my knight onto a good square and threatening a fork! (though maybe I should have moved my bishop first?)",
        "5... Qd6": "this,Qd8 and Qc6 both work to stop the fork, but I prefer this because it keeps the queen active, whereas Qd8 wastes a lot of tempo for Black (and Qc6? threatens a discovered attack after Bf2, with the added danger of the knight playing Nf6 after that)",
        "6. Bg2 b6": "? bad move considering the position of Fou Leblanc... 6...c6 would be far better",
        "7. Ne3": "setting the attack up (I love the position of my knights here, btw :) )",
        "7... a5": "Black also had the option of 7...Bb7 8. Nh4 Bxg2 9.Nxg2",
        "8. Ng5": "discovered attack....",
        "8... Ra7": "but Black easily sidesteps",
        "9. O-O": "protecting my king...",
        "9... Qg6": "while Black goes for the attack, though I think it should have gone for more development",
        "10. h4": "protection for the knight...",
        "10... f6": "but Black just launches a fresh attack!",
        "11. Ne4": "Nh3?? d6! (my knights are in a nice adjacent line again - something about this position looks really cool to me!)",
        "11... Bb7": "threatening to win a piece...",
        "12. Nd5": "denied!",
        "12... b5": "Black missed the...",
        "13. Nxc7+": "King fork! (do I keep saying that in my games? I'm thinking of making it into my own personal catchphrase! :P)",
        "13... Kd8 14. Nxb5 Bxe4": "?? what was once a dangerous move is nullified by the obvious threat on the rook",
        "15. Bxe4": "I decide to exchange first",
        "15... Qxe4 16. Nxa7 Qxc4": "Black grabs the pawn, but ultimately White has gained a rook and pawn for a knight (cancelling out the similar pieces on both sides - and that is how I use Maths in chess!)",
        "17. d3": "chasing the queen away....",
        "17... Qa6": "(!) ouch! Black reclaims his lost material points (if I had forseen this move, then 17. e3 Qa6 18. Qf3)",
        "18. g4": "there's no way to save the knight, so there's no point trying.",
        "18... Qxa7 19. g5": "an attack on the knight (I can aim to double the pawns on the h-file with 19...fxg5 20.Bxg5+, then...21.Bxh6 gxh6) ",
        "19... Ng4": "? a move which looks powerful on the outside, with a lot of pressure on the f2 pawn, but he should have played Nf5, because...",
        "20. e3": "(!) the pressure is immediately revoked, and a discovered attack that the knight has no escape from",
        "20... Qb7": "no hope, no point trying",
        "21. Qxg4 Rf8 22. gxf6": "an exchange of pawns, benefiting White",
        "22... Rxf6 23. Qxg7": "?? White is about to lose that material advantage - again!",
        "23... Rg6+": "(!)",
        "24. Qxg6 hxg6": "equality is now reached once more - it's anyone's game right now",
        "25. Bd2": "connecting my rooks...",
        "25... Qa6 26. Rfc1": "with hopes of doubling my rooks; the threat on Black's bishop forces it to move (26...Qxd3 loses to 27. Bd5+, then 28. Rxc5",
        "26... Be7 27. Rc3": "?? this was with the idea of protecting the d-pawn, but...",
        "27... Bb4": "Pin! or is it a skewer! I need someone to clarify me on that - I'm not too sure on the difference between the two",
        "28. Rc2": "best move, but...",
        "28... Qxd3": "(!) I was expecting a bishop trade, but this was a nasty surprise - White's gonna be losing material no matter what it does! ",
        "29. Bxb4 Qxc2 30. Bxa5+ Kc8 31. b4": "and now, after spending the game simply catching up with lost material, Black has pulled ahead",
        "31... Nc6 32. h5": "a last desperate attack, hoping Black will play Nxa5, giving me a chance of promotion...",
        "32... gxh5": "Denied! And now, with my bishop and pawn stuck in their positions and the queen in such a powerful position (Qb2) I resigned."
