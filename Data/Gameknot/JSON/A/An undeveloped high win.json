        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5": "...with this!",
        "3. d5 Bb4+ 4. Bd2 Qe7 5. Nc3": "I know I'd have to exchange my dsb, but... too bad. It has some positive sides, too. So I better develop, by castling. ",
        "5... O-O 6. a3 Bxc3 7. Bxc3 Ne4": "Now, it's foreseeable he'll put his B on b4, and I'll shield my Q with d6, a natural move. But I have a little surprise for him, that already takes him \"away from his preparation\". Or so I think.",
        "8. Bb4 Qf6": "White has to take care of the mate threat.",
        "9. f3": "Probably a blunder. Nf3 would have been enough.",
        "9... Qh4+ 10. g3 Nxg3 11. hxg3 Qxh1 12. Nh3": "He declines my R on f8, and he has no hopes to trap my queen. Or so I trust.",
        "12... d6": "Threatening Nh3.",
        "13. g4 h5": "Like a wild horse. ",
        "14. Kf2": "Kd2 would have been more sensible.",
        "14... hxg4 15. fxg4": "Bxg4 doesn't give me enough to go on with the attack (Qd3 or Bg2 could have helped white in releasing the tension). So...",
        "15... f5": "I like it. ",
        "16. g5": "Of course, but...",
        "16... f4": "Now ideas as Qg3+ are possible... and the N is still in danger. ",
        "17. Bg2 Qh2 18. Qh1": "White looks for revenge. If I play wrongly, I'll get in trouble along the h column. I better don't allow g6.",
        "18... Qg3+ 19. Kf1 f3": "I'd note my second ! on this pawn advance. It is crushing because of e5-e4 coming next.",
        "20. exf3 e4 21. f4 Bxh3 22. Qxh3 Rxf4+ 23. Kg1 Qf2+ 24. Kh2 Rh4 25. Rf1 Rxh3+ 26. Kxh3 Qe3+": "I have \"extremely undeveloped +8 points\", so... the game is far from won, I can still blow it.",
        "27. Kh2 Nd7": "I can't help Re1, but I can take g5, so I better spend a tempo developing. ",
        "28. Bc3 Rf8": "Exchange sounds good for me! :-D",
        "29. Re1 Qxg5 30. Rxe4 Rf2": "How will white defend g2 now? I spotted this when proposing the R exchange. (Thanks \"my favourite tactic trainer, I owe you one!\")",
        "31. Re8+ Kf7 32. Re2": "This move is a resignation. Some points for my rating, and a fun game I didn't... threw away for a blunder. Thanks for reading!",
