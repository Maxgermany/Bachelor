        "4... cxd4 5. exd4 Bb4+": "This is much more I use to play! In my beloved Budapes, though, I have no central pawns, with lots of useful lines for attack.",
        "6. Nc3 Ne4": "Even better. I make pressure on white, and force him into my game.",
        "7. Bd2": "I can choose: NxB is ok if I want to save my own dsb, but I can also exchange it for the N in order to clear some ways.",
        "7... d5": "This could have been a mistake. Now white can take NxN, and I almost lose a piece. dxN (if BxN+, NxB and I am a piece under!), BxB, exNe3, Qxe3. ",
        "8. cxd5": "My opponent chooses to free the way for his lsb to b5.",
        "8... exd5 9. Ne5": "Well played, since it makes Bb5+ more dangerous.",
        "9... Bxc3": "I saw a way to revert the possible pressure. White could have tried Nxf7, with known and uncertain results. I'll threat first. ",
        "10. Bxc3 Qf6": "White is forced to care for f2, and if he does properly, the game will come out even enough to be long and drawn. ",
        "11. f3": "?? but if he helps me like this, he makes me think I know how to play this game, which is not true. ",
        "11... Qh4+ 12. Ke2": "If g3, Nxg3, of course. Not necessarily winning, but nice to play. Now the obvious one was Ng3+, winning the exchange. But... what about...",
        "12... Qf2+ 13. Kd3": "Ok, now I knew I could have just trapped myself into a dead way, but I just needed one more attacker to get mate. Which is it, and which is the only right way to bring it in? Please, stop the video... :-D",
        "13... b6": "I think there is nothing white can do... it was a lucky move, but I am proud of have found it, and also its elegance. ",
        "14. fxe4 Ba6+ 15. Nc4 Bxc4#": "If I wanted to create such a position for a tactic excercise, I could have lost half of my life! :-) Thanks to my opp!"
