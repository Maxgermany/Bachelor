        "5. g3": "Trying a different approach to the opening, not usual for me. The idea is to take advantage of the diagonal, but is a double edged fight that probably would have costed me the game in an expert's hand. ",
        "5... d6": "Black favours my plan by weakening c6. On the other side, if he wants to untangle his pieces he should be fighting to be safely able to play c5. ",
        "6. a4": "I should have stuck to my plan, with Bg2, but...",
        "6... a6 7. a5": "axb5 was better, but note that I am not still able to secure my dominion of the white diag. So I made a solid outpost for a piece in b6...",
        "7... Nf6 8. Bg2 O-O 9. Nd2": "Black is unsure about how to develop. ",
        "9... Re8": "But now he has a plan: e5. ",

        "10... Nd5 11. Bxd5": "I sacrifice the good bishop, but the diag will be closed to his bishop, too. Black's worst enemy is his own e7 pawn. ",
        "11... cxd5 12. Qf3 dxe5 13. Be3": "I prefer to exchange here and keep the diagonal closed. My king has to castle, and I want it kingside. So it is not wise to overopen the game. ",
        "13... exd4 14. Bxd4 e5": "Good by black. Now I am in little trouble. Fortunately (would you have said that?) my outpost is excellent...",
        "15. Bb6 e4 16. Qe3": "Simply. This turned out to be more complicated for me than foreseen, due to my unwise moves. ",

        "21. Qh6": "Anyway. ",
        "21... Nf6 22. O-O": "I adore castling when it is an attacking move, but probably g5 would have been more accurate. ",
        "22... Qe8 23. f4 Qf8 24. Qh4": "I can cash some edge by exchanging queens due to f5. But it is far too low a prize for me. ",
