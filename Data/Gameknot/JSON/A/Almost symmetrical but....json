        "7... Be7": "Lsb is fine here. In the future will come c5. ",
        "8. Qd2": "That gave me an idea. I can take advantage of BxN inmediately, but maybe he is planning to take advantage of this column. Not so easy. I have another trick in my sleeve. ",
        "8... Ne4": "BxN, dxB, and Ne5 is not possible due to NxN (d4 is pinned to the WQ).",

        "11... Nxe5": "I'll take the pawn. ",
        "12. Qf4": "Interesting! White is winning back his piece with subtleties. Here, Nf3+, gxN, Bxc3 assures black a strong bind on the white king. g5 is not enough against Qg3, and nothing changes. Be2, Re1 just helps my opponent, so...",
