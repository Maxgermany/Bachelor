        "3. Nxe5": "White took advantage of black's \"f6\". For those who do not know, the white knight can't be taken OR ELSE.  A good move for black now is Qe7 which will regain the pawn.",

        "4. Qh5+": "A very good move. g6 is horrible (Not the song) because it would lose the rook and a pawn after Qxe5+. Black's only \"good\" option is to move the king.",

        "7. Qf5+": "Before the bloodbath would begin, black resigned. Remember that this was played in the casual section of the tournament. Once again, great play by white."
