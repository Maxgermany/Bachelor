        "2. Nf3": "I see both c4 and Nf3 here. Both have been options I've seen played by white. ",
        "2... g6": "Going for the fianchetto. Rather than seek direct center control, most of the time I use pieces to control it from a distance. From talking with a few people this type of mindset is from the hyper modern school of thought.",
        "3. Bf4 Bg7 4. e3 d6 5. h3 O-O": "So far so good. No errors yet.",
        "6. Be2 Nc6 7. O-O e5 8. dxe5 Ne4": "My reason for playing the fianchetto was to get into a spot where I could make a move like this later in the game. ",
        "9. c3 dxe5 10. Bh2 Qe7 11. Nbd2 Rd8": "Pinning the d2 knight.",
        "12. Qc2 Bf5": "?? - This is the move that loses me the game. I was playing it out in my head to exchange the knight first, then make this move. Unfortunately, this is not what happened in the game. A rare lapse by me.",
        "13. Nxe4 Bxe4 14. Qxe4 Rd2": "Why did I continue? Because I generally don't resign after the first major blunder. But this move was a memory lapse and when I made it I was thinking to myself that something doesn't look right here. My issue? I had just seen the move I missed, which would've made this system work. ",
        "15. Nxd2": "Alas, I see my next move coming and I didn't have the heart to continue. Hope this is not a sign of things to come for me, but I knew I was going to be punished for my fast play sooner or later. Was just hoping it would not be this bad."
