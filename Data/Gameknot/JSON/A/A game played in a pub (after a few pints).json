        "1... c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6": "After 5 moves, we have sicilian scheveningen variation. ",
        "6. Be3 a6": "Be3, a6 we have transposed to english attack (kind of).",
        "7. Bc4": "Developing my lsb.",
        "7... b5 8. Bb3 Bb7": "Black carried on with Bb7 adding more pressure to my centre, maybe planning to play Nbd7 and then Rc8 later.",
        "9. f3": "F3, defending my e pawn, also prevents Ng4 in the future. ",
        "9... g6": "I was hoping black to play Be7, then I would carry on with Bxe6, fxe6 and Nxe6, forking black's queen and g pawn. However my opponent responded with G6, which indicates that he is going to fianchetto his dsb then castle king side. ",
        "10. Qd2": "Qd2, preparing to castle queen side, and then launch pawn storm on black's king side.",
        "10... Bg7 11. a3": "Now a3, safety first, preventing b4 which could be an annoying move.",
        "11... O-O 12. O-O-O": "Everything went according to my plan. ",
        "12... Nc6": "Frankly speaking, I don't think this move is not accurate, better move would be Nbd7 then Rc8.",
        "13. Nxc6 Bxc6 14. Bh6": "I could have played Qxd6, win a pawn, but I decided to keep my queen to help the king side attack. Bh6 trading black's dsb (which is one of black's most important defending pieces).",
        "14... Bxh6 15. Qxh6 Qc7": "This move makes sense, connecting his rooks, lining up his queen with my king, also he can now bring a rook to defend his d pawn.",
        "16. h4": "Here it goes!",
        "16... Kh8": "With this move, black is now planning to play Ng8, protecting the weak dark squares.",
        "17. g4": "My pawns are rolling.",
        "17... Ng8 18. Qf4": "Qf4, provoking e5, so that black would have a weak d pawn.",

        "19. Qd2": "Qd2. Retreating my queen, also attacks black's d pawn.",
        "19... Rfd8 20. h5": "I carried on with the attack on black's kind side.",
        "20... a5": "Black now launches his own pawn storm.",
        "21. hxg6": "Hxg6 threatening mate in one.",
        "21... fxg6 22. Qg5": "Qg5, bringing my queen close to black's king, also threatening Qxg6.",
        "22... Kg7": "Kg7, this looks kind of odd, surely Qg7 would be better.",
        "23. Bxg8": "Bxg8, before making my move, I did think about playing Nd5, but instead I decided to trade off his knight, which was a good defending piece. However, Bxg8 turns out to be a mistake.",
        "23... Kxg8 24. Nd5": "Now Nd5, attacking black's queen also with the intention to play Nf6+.",
        "24... Bxd5": "He took my knight without second thought.",
        "25. Rxd5 Rac8": "Now black is threatening mate in one.",
        "26. Rh2": "Pretty much forced.",
        "26... b4 27. axb4 axb4 28. Qf6": "Qf6, threatening Qe6+",
        "28... Rdf8": "He definitely over looked Qe6+, the best move for black would be Re8 which prevents the check.",
        "29. Qe6+ Kh8 30. Rxd6 Rxf3": "After Rxf3 I had to be very careful here, I thought about Qxe5+, but I came up with a shocking move.",
        "31. Rxh7+": "Rxh7+! Tal mode activates. Now if Qxh7, Qxc8+ is coming. ",
        "31... Kxh7": "Thus he took the rook with the king.",
        "32. Rd7+": "Rd7+ forking black's queen and king.",
        "32... Qxd7": "I think my friend was too drunk to play at that point, he played Qxd7!! Then he immediately resigned. The best move for black would be Kh6, then after Rxc7, Rxc7 black would end up with 2 rooks vs queen, and would still have a chance. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did, please leave your comments, thanks for tuning in. See ya!"
