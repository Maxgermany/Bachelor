        "1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 f6": "ECO - B00",
        "4. f4": "4. Other possible moves - Nf3, Qh5 , Bb5, Bd3, exf6, c3 and Bf4 (from a search of 2 million games)\n",
        "4... Bf5": "4. ... Bf5 main line, other possible moves g6, Nh6, e6 (a bit pointless IMO as it locks in the white squared bishop), fxe5 (which I didn't like as it opened up the board leaving white with an early space advantage)\n\nWhat I liked about the games viewed down this line is that black gets his white squared bishop outside of the pawns and black can exchange the pawns at any time he/she chooses.",
        "5. Nf3": "5. Bb5 is a good alternative, other possible moves Ne2, c3 and the obvious Bd3. Be3 and a3 do not seem to lead to much IMO, yet both have been played in master games)",
        "5... Be4": "5.  ... Be4 now the game is interesting. Black has taken two moves with the bishop in the opening. Generally it can lead to trouble moving a piece twice in opening - the advantage here is that any change by white gives black a passed pawn. (of course with timely f5).",
        "6. Bb5": "The only two moves I could find from a 3.5 million game search were Nbd2 and Be2. I back tracked a few moves and found a ton of games with 5. Bb5 Qd7 and played through those to see what plans worked for black. So I combined two strategies - get a pawn on e4 and \"threaten\" queen side pawn advance. It is interesting to put the queen on a pin like this, but I could not see any way white could take advantage of it.",
        "6... Qd7 7. O-O": "7. or develop the queen side - one possible advantage of Nbd2 is an early c4 OR trade off the bishop then N(f3)d2 and then c4 - which would probably force black to castle queen side (as developing king side minor pieces would take a couple of moves)  - white could then plan around a queen side attack using the space advantage in the centre.",
        "7... a6 8. Ba4": "8. Bxc6 gives up the bishop pair for no advantage.",
        "8... e6": "8. ... e6, f5, move out dark squared bishop & Nge7 - looks ok for black. I realised here that black had a potential king side attack as well.\nAs white I would play Be3, Nbd2, c4, swap the bishop and play down the queen side.",
        "9. Nbd2 f5 10. Nxe4": "10. c4 ... this just hands the centre to black. ",
        "10... dxe4 11. Bxc6": "11. Nbd2 & c4. White has to try to open up the centre and try to force black to castle Q-side. If this happened then the pin on c6 starts to \"bite\".",
        "11... Qxc6 12. Nd2": "12. Ng5 might have been interesting. Black can't castle due to Nf7. 12. ... h6 leads to Qh5 . This may have given a tempo or two for white to advance one or two of the queen side pawns, giving black some potential problems with q-side castling. The best seems to be Nh6, 0-0-0, Rf8 then think about driving away the knight on g5.\nThe point of this game plan is white gets tied down to stopping a timely advance of the e pawn.\nA big disadvantage here for white is the centre pawns are on same coloured square as the bishop.",
        "12... O-O-O": "With a tempo - the d pawn is \"hanging\".",
        "13. Nb3 Ne7": "Heading for d5",
        "14. Be3": "14. Bd2, Rc1 and c4 seen a better plan here. \n\nNd5 (at any time) forces white to move or defend.\n\nIMO I think this was white's last chance to take advantage of the space in the centre. Bd3 leaves white responding to blacks threats from this point on. \n\n",
        "14... Nd5 15. Qe2 Nxe3 16. Qxe3 Qxc2 17. Rf2": "17. Rfc1 makes more sense to me here. White then has d5  followed by a possible Qb6/Qa7 & Na5/c5 attack. Since white is a pawn down - its better to be aggressive and try to force something on the queen side.\n17. Rf2 is passive, its only function is now to protect the b pawn. This move lets me \"off the hook\" for being greedy.\n\nI thought for while about this as I knew the c pawn was a potentially poisonous one. I trusted in c6, Rd7 to protect the king long enough to get the queen back via a3 (after Qxb2 to a Rfc1).",
        "17... Qc6 18. Rc1": "Too late! The queen is back \"home\".",
        "18... Qd5 19. Rfc2": "I can't see much else white can do here. As previously noted, the critical position (IMO) was at move 14.\nKing side attack is out of the question & queen side pawn push goes no where as black as an extra pawn on that side. The lost c pawn would have made a big difference in this position - assuming it was on c3",
        "19... c6 20. Rd1 Be7": "20. ... Be7. I figured that if white ever plays Nc5, I would swap. I also realised that a possible queen for two rooks would leave white with no play as both rooks would be on the d file and white's queen could not get past the 3rd rank. (as it happened in the game).",
        "21. a3 h6": "Wait & see move - with a possibility of Rg8 & g5",
        "22. Nc5": "22. Nc5?\n\nThe game is already lost anyway, this just hastens the end.",
        "22... Bxc5 23. Rxc5 Qxc5 24. dxc5 Rxd1+": "Larry admitted at this point that he had not calculated past Rxd1 .\n\nThe point is that the white king cannot avoid being forced behind the queen -  when Rd6 wins.",
