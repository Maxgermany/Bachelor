        "1. Nf3": "Trying out Reti as white, a closed opening, against a stronger opponent.",
        "1... f5": "Not a common response, called \"A04: Reti v Dutch.\"",
        "2. g3": "I respond with g3.  Apparently, the stronger responses are b3 or b4.",
        "2... Nf6 3. Bg2 d5 4. d3 e6 5. O-O Bd6 6. Nbd2 O-O": "Through a roundabout way, we wound up coming back to a more \"standard\" looking Reti opening, i.e. 1. Nf3 e6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 Bd6 4. d3 f5 5. O-O Nf6 6. Nb-d2 O-O (A04: Reti opening).",
        "7. c4": "My logic here is that I gain a slight advantage if he takes the c pawn with his d pawn.  He can't advance to d4 because of my knight at f3.",
        "7... c6 8. cxd5": "Although this amounts to a trade of pawns (no advantage), I take it anyway, probably out of a sense that I'm playing a stronger player.",
        "8... Nxd5": "I feel this weakens the castle unnecessarily, particularly when cxd5 is just as good if not better.  As a result, I gain a slight advantage in that I retain a pawn in the d file.",
        "9. a3": "Buying time and countering the presence of the bishop.",
        "9... e5": "Seems like a logical move as it sets up pressure on the knight at f3.",
        "10. Nc4": "Sometimes, I like to trade my knight for a bishop.",
        "10... Re8": "He doesn't object to the trade.",
        "11. Nxd6": "So I take the trade.",
        "11... Qxd6 12. e4": "Offering what looks to be a more powerful pawn (fxe4 dxe4), but this sets up a trap in that his Queen is unprotected.",
        "12... Ne7": "He avoids the trap.",
        "13. b4": "Buying time, developing some space.",
        "13... fxe4 14. dxe4 Qxd1 15. Rxd1": "Queen trade accepted, and I gain control of the d file.",
        "15... Bg4": "Good pressure move.",
        "16. h3": "Go away or trade!",
        "16... Bxf3": "He opts to trade.",
        "17. Bxf3": "17 moves in and I have two bishops against two knights.  As long as I watch for forks, I feel I'm in a good position.",
        "17... Na6 18. Bb2": "Pressuring the solo pawn.",
        "18... Ng6 19. Bh5": "Similar to his earlier move, only in reverse.",
        "19... Kf7": "I can see why he did this, because he avoids stacked pawns, at least at this point.  But ...",
        "20. Rd7+": "Hello!",
        "20... Re7": "His best move.  No slouch here.",
        "21. Bxg6+": "So, at this point, I figure I'll take what I can get, which is stacked pawns.  Here were my notes from this point, which came true up to his response in move 23.\n21.\t... \thxg6\n22.\tRxe7  \tKxe7\n23.\tBxe5 \tKf7\n24.\tRd1 \tRg8\n25.\tRd7  \tKe6\n26.\tRxg7 \tRxg7\n27.\tBxg7 ( 2)",
        "21... hxg6 22. Rxe7+ Kxe7 23. Bxe5": "Finally, a pawn advantage!",
        "23... Re8": "I expected a move to protect his g pawn, but he apparently overlooked it.",
        "24. Bxg7": "Easy pawn.",
        "24... Kf7": "Ahead 2, I'm happy to trade, even if it's a stronger pawn for a weaker one.  So, I set up to take the a7 pawn.",
        "25. Bd4 Rxe4 26. Bxa7": "I don't know that I had a clear win, but he probably wasn't too happy about giving up that second pawn.  If we had continued, I would have tried to get the bishop and rook to work together on a weak pawn.  Good game kansaspatzer!"
