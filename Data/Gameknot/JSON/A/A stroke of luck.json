        "1. f4": "Another tournament game, for me this comes while my rating is at its lowest range for some considerable time. This game however was over in only 6 moves.",
        "1... e5": "Tournament start position, Bird opening, From Gambit.",
        "2. fxe5": "Nothing much wrong with this move, it's been a common one in the tournament.",
        "2... d6": "A bit of me thinks this is is a strange move and I have had mixed success with it in the tournament. ",
        "3. exd6 Nf6": "For me this move was a bit of an experiment, previous efforts had mostly revolved around Bxd6 but here I stuck with the old adage of getting knights out before bishops. The gameknot database seems to indicate this as promising too.\n\nFrom my perspective I was starting to get ideas about a possible Ne4 and Qh4 early attack, trying to take advantage of the e1-h4 open diagonal",
        "4. dxc7 Qxc7": "No real alternative here that I could see and I would love to get my queen to g3",
        "5. d4": "This is the sort of normal developing move that with the benefit of hindsight looks quite weak. I'm not sure what would be better, perhaps e3 or Nc2",
        "5... Bg4": "Looking to tease the h pawn forward, if that doesn't work then the e pawn is still pinned to the queen and I have Bd6 threatening a bishop sac on h2, perhaps Bd6 would have been the better move, I'm still not entirely sure.",
        "6. h3": "This is the losing move for white.",
        "6... Qg3+": "White resigned due to Kd2, Ne4#\n\nMany thanks for reading please comment."
