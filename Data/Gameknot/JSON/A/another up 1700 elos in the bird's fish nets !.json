        "2. fxe5": "the best solution in my opinion, but then the situation is not comfortable for white. This is the risk with e4 ...",
        "2... d6": "what you should not play is exd6 ! then he take back with the dsb and the way for a killer attack with the queen on h5 is done ...",
        "3. Nf3": "this is the best answer, but the situation is still very uncomfortable ..",

        "14... d5": "that was expected, i will play Nd2",
        "15. Nd2 O-O": "so the result of my plan is that i'm 1 pawn less, and a very weak situation in king side. great ! at this moment i'm not expecting any victory ...",
