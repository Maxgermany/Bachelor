    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6": "Now in the Sicilian, I like to take things out of book, simply because the Sicilian IS so good for black.",
        "3. Be2": "SO I often do this quiet move, intending to rid myself of this light-squared bishop as soon as I'm able due to how I position my pawn structure. This gives black a chance to wrest the initiative from white, but changes how he intends to play. If instead he stays with the main themes of the Sicilian, he often ends up having trouble deciding how to proceed in the midgame.",
        "3... Nf6 4. d3 g6": "Upon moving d3, my opponent correctly fianchettoes, anticipating c3 or c4 by white soon. I delay that, because I don't want to make that move too early, encouraging black to crash his pawns down on the queenside, or get in f5 before I get in f4, which makes for a very open and challenging contest.",
        "5. O-O Bg7 6. Kh1": "Prophylactic. As it turned out, a wasted tempo. But at this point, no harm done.",
        "6... O-O 7. Ng1": "This, to a player who recognizes a little deviation from the Sicilian is needed, is really too slow by white.",
        "7... Nc6 8. f4": "When I play my pawns in this position, I've found that black allowing me to get in f4 is never a good thing for black.",
        "8... Bd7 9. c4 Qc8": "Here black probably should have chosen a continuation involving ...Nd4 and ...b5.",
        "10. Nf3 a6": "If black plans on a queenside assault, now would be a good time. But he doesn't. At the least it would have distracted my own designs.",
        "11. a3": "And it allows me to put my queen on a better square than d2.",
        "11... Ng4 12. h3": "My opponent provoked this move, intending to take advantage of it later.",
        "12... Nf6 13. Kh2": "This was nearly forced, as otherwise, tactics now with a bishop sacrifice could get very ugly for white. But here, my opponent seems to have run out of correct responses to white's passive obstructing play.",
        "13... e5": "This will only be dangerous for white if black finishes the queenside play, blowing the board wide open I've found in my own games.",
        "14. Qc2 exf4 15. Bxf4 Qc7": "This was a small inaccuracy, gaining white a much needed tempo shortly. Qb8 was much better.",
        "16. Nc3 Nh5": "In light of this tempo I receive, this was the plan that lost this game for black, as I have the queen threat first.",
        "17. Nd5 Qb8 18. Be3 Be5+": "A nice idea, but the timing is wrong due to black's out of place knight on h5, and that extra tempo I had to get my knight to d5. The continuation is easy to spot.",
        "19. Nxe5 Nxe5 20. Bxh5 gxh5": "And after my bishop move, black resigned.",
        "21. Bh6": "The black king is under a powerful attack, loss of material is imminent. I've played this position out on Fritz, and Fritz actually likes 21. Nf6+ more than 21. Bh6, but both moves win for white. Black made only a couple mistakes here along with ideas that just needed to be better supported. Had black perhaps prepared his idea a bit more thoroughly, or perhaps tried another more aggressive plan with his pawns, I'm sure the game would have been a much greater struggle."
