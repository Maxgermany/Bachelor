    "moves": {
        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Bc5": "This isn't a line played that often, but still somewhat decent for Black, called the M\u00f6ller variation. More common are 5...Be7, 5...Nxe4(My current interest of investigation) and 5...b5 6.Bb3 Bc5/Bb7.",
        "6. c3 O-O 7. d4 Ba7 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bh4 b5": "But here is where I feel things started to go wrong for Black. 9...exd4 or 9...d6 are the most solid choices. As you'll see neglecting the centre may be somewhat disastrous.",
        "10. dxe5 g5 11. exf6 gxh4 12. e5 bxa4": "The only game I could find that featured 9...b5 continued with 12...Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Qxf6 14.Ng4 and White won in 62 moves. The text seems to be the most critical test, but allows a quite nice forced combination.",
        "13. Qc1": "13.Qd2 is the same, intending Qxh6-g7#.",
        "13... Kh7 14. Qc2+": "As tempting as it may be, it seems there's no win in sight after 14.Ng5+?! Kg6!",
        "14... Kh8 15. Ng5": "This is the whole point of this line, opening the h-file for my queen to come with check, which will force Black to give up his queen to avoid mate. Believe it or not, engines have difficulty spotting this idea at first, and suggest taking the draw by repetition with 15.Qc1 Kh7 16.Qc2+ etc.",
        "15... hxg5 16. Qd1 Nxe5 17. Qh5+ Kg8 18. Qh6": "Not 18.Qxg5+?? Ng6 which throws away the win after 19.Qh6 Qxf6 when there's no 20.Qxf6 back.",
        "18... Qxf6 19. Qxf6 Ng6 20. Qxg5 Rb8": "Now we reach an interesting middlegame where I have a queen vs 2 minor pieces, but it doesn't look that easy to covert the full point yet. In fact I wasn't sure if I could break through a possible fortress.",
        "21. c4": "I decide to give up the b-pawn in order to develop my queenside pieces as soon as possible. Going back with 21.Qd2/Qc1 to simply defend b2 would be a loss of time IMO. Also my knight would be better placed on c3 than on d2.",
        "21... Rxb2 22. Nc3 Bb7 23. c5": "I felt no hurry to take on a4, as it wasn't going anywhere anyway. First I restrict his DSB, as his infuence on the a7-g1 diagonal alongside his rook on the 7th rank annoys me a bit.",
        "23... d6 24. Rab1": "Exchanging my passive rook for his active one.",
        "24... a3 25. Na4 Rxb1 26. Rxb1 Be4 27. Rc1 Kg7 28. Qd2": "At this point, I decide it's time to start going after his queenside pawns. My queen did her job on the kingside, now it's time to shift for the other wing.",
        "28... dxc5 29. Nxc5 Bf5 30. Qc3+ f6 31. Qf3": "Before taking on a3, I provoke him into misplaying his knight into a more passive role, so I win a tempo in comparison to directly taking it. On 31...Bc8 then 32.Nxa6! Bxa6 33.Rxc7+ Rf7 34.Rxf7 Kxf7 35.Qxa3 Bxf2+ 36.Kxf2 should be easily winning, as he must give up a piece to stop my a-pawn.",
        "31... Ne7 32. Qxa3 Ng6 33. Nxa6 c6": "A small finesse by my opponent. The immediate 33...Re8 is met by 34.Nxc7 winning a piece.",
        "34. Rxc6 Re8": "Intending mate, so I must be a bit careful here.",
        "35. Rc7+ Kh8 36. Kf1": "If 36.Rxa7? Re1#, and 36.Qc1?! threatening Qh6+ seems tempting, but then 36...Nf4! is a bit tricky(37.Rxa7 Ne2+; 37.Qxf4? Re1#). So by elimination, I opted for the text.",
        "36... Bb6 37. Qd6": "The most forcing, as I give up the exchange for a pawn to render his pieces immobile for the rest of the game.",
        "37... Bxc7 38. Qxf6+ Kh7 39. Qxf5": "Once again, 39.Nxc7? Bd3+ 40.Kg1 Re1# is a big no, so we must never get careless.",
        "39... Re7 40. Nc5": "No need to trade as my knight is far superior to his remaining bishop now. And that alongside the pin on his knight is decisive.",
        "40... Bf4 41. Ne6 Bh6": "Prevents Nf8+ and Nxg6, but all it's according to my original idea.",
        "42. a4 Ra7 43. a5": "And here my opponent resigned, as there isn't much to be done anymore. Once I get my pawn to a6(Which he won't be able to take due to Qf7+ and Qxg6), I'll just advance my kingside ones to finally break through. This was quite a nice example, and thanks to redenaar for this great game!"
