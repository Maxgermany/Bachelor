        "1. e4": "This is a very short game I played in a local tournament. After getting into a highly tactical variation of pirc defense, black is not able to handle the tactics and loses immediately to a cool mating combination.",
        "1... d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4 Bg7 5. Nf3 c5": "I had reached this position at least three times in my games. Against Gary Joe (rated 1650) I tried dxc5 and then playing as if it was a Dragon, but I quickly lost. After that I experimented with Qd3 and Be3, but got into poor positions as well. Finally, I looked up the variation MCO suggested: Bb5 .",

        "9... Kxf7": "A mistake. Black should play 9... Kd7 10. Nxb5",
        "10. Ng5+ Kf6": "As my opponent later explained to me, after deciding that Ke8 loses a bishop to Ne6, he decided to go to  f6 (unfortunately losing the king...) \r\n**************************************\r\nQ. Can you see a forced checkmate in 6 for white?\r\n**************************************",
