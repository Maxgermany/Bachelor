        "1. e4 d5 2. e5": "Less often played than exd, leads to a well-known game in which one of main black concerns is how to develop the dsb. ",
        "2... Bf5 3. d4 e6 4. c3": "I would try c4 instead, but this move makes black play following a known scheme. ",
        "4... a6": "I'm not in a hurry, and I just don't like the game after Bb5+.",
        "5. Nf3 h6": "Clamly, making room for my lsb to h2. This move is not recommended in my own personal line, since it takes the h6 square, often the knight's way out. ",
        "6. a3": "This is a loss of tempo, since b4 is already guarded. And it weakens b3.",
        "6... c5 7. Be3": "True is that the dsb's way would be closed for a long time. And with it, with two more pieces, the knight and the rook. ",
        "7... Qb6 8. Qc1": "It's true my kingside is blocked, but I have plenty of play on the queenside. ",
        "8... Nc6 9. h3": "Pointless, the bishop's diagonal is mine. ",
        "9... cxd4": "Trying to free my dsb, even though for an exchange. ",
        "10. cxd4": "He holds me in, but in doing so, he is trapping his own pieces, now completely inactive. ",
        "10... Na5 11. Nbd2": "Guarding b3, naturally. ",
        "11... Kd8": "Can you believe this? Black's best move, and it is losing castling right, making his way toward the center... etc. etc. ",
        "12. g4": "I can play Rf8 right now, but I started to \"spin\" (toward disaster). ",
        "12... Be4": "NxB, Nb3!, Qb1, NxR",
        "13. Bg2": "White tries to castle, but overlooks....",
        "13... Rc8 14. Qd1": "Nothing clear comes out from Bc2, Qe2, so...",
        "14... Bd3": "Preventing castling, but the bishop is undefended. ",
        "15. b4": "Inmediately I thought about Bxb4. A piece for two pawns, AND the freedom of the kingside, finally. But what can whte do, really?",
        "15... Nc4 16. Nb3": "NxN, BxN, and black doesn't have problems. But this is mortal for white. ",
        "16... Nb2 17. Qd2 Rc2": "Wow! I never thought I could reach this queenbind in a real game...",
        "18. Qxc2 Bxc2 19. O-O": "White probably calculates that after BxN, Rb1 will recover the piece. He was in an urgo to castle.",
        "19... Bxb3 20. Rab1 Bc4": "...but he didn't see this one. Here, the exchange lines fail. ",
        "21. Rfc1 Na4": "Or Nd3. But I didn't see much future there. Here blocks completely any white's plan...",
        "22. Nd2 Bd3 23. Rb3": "To keep the good diagonal is important. Here, white can exchange the bishop with Bf1, but in that case it's ok.",
        "23... Qb5 24. f4": "As you can see, despite being +7 material advantage, black has a long job to do prior to prevale. Note that at move 24 my kingside is still unmoved!",
        "24... Ne7 25. h4 Nc8 26. h5 Ncb6 27. f5": "White can even have some attack!",
        "27... Nc4": "Exchanging some more piece would have given my the victory, for sure. "
