        "1. Nf3": "Hi everyone!\n\nIn the early part of the middlegame I got too tempted to leave my knight on a \"strong\" outpost that could be attacked by an enemy pawn.  Glenda inadvertently trapped her own steed by cutting off the only escape square it could have had.  This was brought home to me when Fou Lenoir was attacked.  I then decided that the best way out of this was to sac Fou Lenoir for two kingside pawns which left King Bookie rather draughty.  Can Glenda make amends and save the day?  If you do not wish to see the GA spoiler below you can just read on .......",

        "17... g5": "17. ..... g5! Black exploits this and this move cleverly blocks off Fou Lenoir's defense of f6.  Now if Fou Lenoir moves to g3 then e6 makes my d5 knight into horsemeat!",
