        "1. e4": "Well, this game was a very narrow miss.  My opponent, who correctly caught my blunder nearly roasted me.  I thought I was the bread winner, but it turns out I was toast.  Burnt, charcoal toast- and with no butter.  I decided to annotate this game as my first- perhaps to hopefully learn to \"think\" before I move in the future.\n\nI'm still relatively new to chess, so I suspect some of my analysis will be off the mark.  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, or even if you have a thought, please share; we can both learn together.  At the moment, I favor two openings: King's Pawn Opening and Queen's Pawn Opening, which I usually hope leads to Queen's gambit.  This game, I chose the former.",
        "1... e5": "Black offers a King's Pawn Game, which I always like :).",
        "2. Nf3": "I make a standard followup move, which is per the book King's Knight Opening.  The idea, I suspect, is to threaten to remove his control of the center and gain piece advantage.  I would expect Nc6 or d6 to defend, or a counter attack with Nf6.",
        "2... Bd6": "But, black surprises me with Bd6!?  It's not a move per the book.  Perhaps he's playing chess from the hip, or maybe he's trying to throw me off my game with a relatively foreign move?  In hindsight, which is 20/20 they say, I probably should have played 3.d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 ... to remove his control of the center and solidify my own.",
        "3. Nc3": "Decided to go for some development.",
        "3... Nc6": "He responds with the move I would have expected earlier, but the option to remove his control of the center is still there.",
        "4. d4": "4. d4 with the idea that 4. ... exd4 5. Nxd4 Nxd4 6. Qxd4.  This would remove his control of the center as well as give me one developed piece ahead of him.",
        "4... exd4": "Yep.",
        "5. Nxd4": "Yep yep.",
        "5... Be5": "Another move I didn't expect.  Is he trying to pin my knight to my other knight... maybe he's trying to keep some center control?  I saw this as an opportunity to gain some positional advantage.",
        "6. Nxc6": "By 6. Nxc6, I was forcing him to react.  He COULD have 6. ... Bxc3, but then I'd have his queen.  He COULD develop/retreat his queen, but then I could take his bishop (Nxe5).  So, naturally, he gets a double pawn, which are always fun to work with. (#sarcasm.)",
        "6... bxc6": "He decided to open the second leftmost file.  Not a terrible idea as now his rook at a8 is one move away from activation.  I didn't particularly want a double pawn...",
        "7. Bd2": "... so, I moved 7. Bd2.  According to the computer analysis GameKnot provides, this move was a minor mistake because of this line: \n\n7. ... Nf6  8. Bd3 Rb8  9. Qc1 O-O  10. O-O d6 11. Re1 Be6  12. f4 Bd4+  13. Be3 Bxc3  14. bxc3 a5 ...\n\nThe Nf6, I think, is meant to threaten capture of the center in order to force me to move my knight from c3, so black's bishop can threaten my rook with Bxb2 followed with a Rb8.  I can see the necessity of Bd3 because of this.\n\nHowever, in response to Rb8, which threatens Rxb2, I'd either move my own rook to guard b2 or I'd move my pawn (f4) to threaten his bishop which is kinda the crux of the problem anyways??  Am I missing something?  Then, if he takes my knight (Bxc3), I take Bxc3 and the threat to my rook is gone.  If, instead, he presses the issue with Bd4, I can do e5, threatening his newly developed knight, which can either retreat (and he loses development), or he can move Nd5, where I Nxd5.  From there, if he goes Bxb2, I simply Rb2, pinning his bishop to his rook.  If he takes my knight instead (cxd5), then I can move my pawn (c3) and the threat is once again dispelled.\n\nI didn't see all this mid-game, but I think Bd2 is actually just fine.",
        "7... d5": "Well, anyways... *ahem\n\nBlack threatens to remove my center control.  8. exd5 would give him the center.",
        "8. f4": "Fortunately, I saw an option:  8. f4.  If he goes for the kill with his bishop (like a lot of players I've played seem to do), then I saw this line:\n\n8. ... Bxc3  9. Bxc3 dxe4  10. Qxd8+ Kxd8  11. O-O-O+\n\nHe'd get the center, but at least I'd have a developed rook, a protected king and tempo!",
        "8... Bf6": "Maybe he saw this, or instinctively saw little gain from taking the knight because of my bishop?",
        "9. e5": "Taking advantage of his retreat, I aim to keep tempo and the center.  I kinda expected Bh4+.",
        "9... Be7": "Oh dear...\n\nThis is where things went horribly wrong for me.  I blame the stress of finals week.  I remember signing on, seeing I had a day left to make a move and very rashly making the next move.",
        "10. g4": "That pawn is defended, I swear!",
        "10... Bh4+": "Oh, my pawn isn't there to guard from check anymore... I think I'll have to move my king now.",
        "11. Ke2": "That pawn is still guarded, right?  Oh no...",
        "11... Bxg4+": "#Profanities",
        "12. Kd3": "\"See you later, honey.\"",
        "12... Bxd1": "I watched thee when the foe was at our side,\nReady to strike at him\u2014or thee and me,\nWere safety hopeless\u2014rather than divide\nAught with one loved save love and liberty.\n\nI watched thee on the breakers, when the rock,\nReceived our prow, and all was storm and fear,\nAnd bade thee cling to me through every shock;\nThis arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier.\n\nI watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes,\nYielding my couch and stretched me on the ground\nWhen overworn with watching, ne\u2019er to rise\nFrom thence if thou an early grave hadst found.\n\nThe earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall,\nAnd men and nature reeled as if with wine.\nWhom did I seek around the tottering hall?\nFor thee. Whose safety first provide for? Thine.\n\nAnd when convulsive throes denied my breath\nThe faintest utterance to my fading thought,\nTo thee\u2014to thee\u2014e\u2019en in the gasp of death\nMy spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought.\n\nThus much and more; and yet thou lov\u2019st me not,\nAnd never wilt! Love dwells not in our will.\nNor can I blame thee, though it be my lot\nTo strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still.\n\n~Lord Byron (1958)",
        "13. Nxd1": "Desperately trying to get some piece value.  I was in a bind.  I could have also taken black's bishop with the rook, but that would have made it harder to quickly get my king to a safe spot.  Plus, it seemed fifty-fifty whether black chose to move his queen to the open file on the left, or sweep down on the right.",
        "13... c5": "Not only had I lost my queen, but my king was wide open for harassment and an easy checkmate, so I decided to manually make a castle for myself.",
        "14. c3": "BREAK THE DAM!",
        "14... c4+": "Goblins at the Gate!",
        "15. Kc2": "Some breathing room.",
        "15... Qb8": "So, black's play looked like a double up with the rook and queen- likely with queen at the front.  That would take two turns to do.  Plus my other rook at h1 could be threatened by his queen after it moved to b7 followed with d4.",
        "16. Ne3": "The analysis computer doesn't even offer any input at this point.  It's already thrown in the towel for me; probably rightly so.\n\nThe idea with this knight move (Ne3), was to harass the bishop to gain tempo, which would then lead into a free pawn and more tempo at g7.  The line I foresaw was: 16. ... Qb7  17. Nf5 B??  18. Nxg7+.",
        "16... Qb7": "Yep.",
        "17. Nf5": "Yep.",
        "17... Be7": "A retreat!  Perhaps to threaten b2, but I didn't think he'd go for it.",
        "18. Nxg7+": "Another reason I decided to place my knight here was that I hoped black would attempt to threaten knight capture with Kf8 because this would give me an excuse to develop my rook, trap his king some, and make developing his knight and rook just a little harder to do.",
        "18... Kf8": "Now his king is trapped a bit.",
        "19. Rg1": "A developed rook!",
        "19... Rb8": "Sweating bullets...",
        "20. Rb1": "Pawning up with b3 or b4 didn't yield favorable outcomes.  Rab1 gave me just one more move on him to prevent him from doing what he wanted.",
        "20... Ba3": "So, he did go for the bishop move, threatening b2.  bxa3 was out of the question since it was a one move checkmate, but from what I could see, if he did Bxb2, then his bishop would have been pinned to his queen.  I saw three decent moves for myself: b3, b4 and Bh3 (to connect my rooks and develop my bishop more towards his king).",
        "21. b4": "I liked b4 because it provided the possibility to trap his bishop.  From here, things looked ok for me, if black decided to go for trades.  I say \"ok,\" but of course, if black took even trades, he would eventually win the game.",
        "21... a6": "It seemed harmless.  Why not just go for a5?",
        "22. Bh3": "This was an enormously risky move on my part.  The idea was to get more power pieces centralized around his king because I hoped to get his king into a sticky situation; by so doing, I could conceivably force black to trade down pieces or get a stalemate.  However, if black realized that less pressure was on his pawns at c4 and d5, then he might have been able to pull of a checkmate rather rapidly.",
        "22... c5": "Ironically, if I had taken with bxc5, his queen would have been forced to run temporarily.  But from there, it would have been likely 23. bxc5 Qc7  24. Rxb8 Qxb8, and now I still have checkmate threatening me.  Plus, getting his queen to move, I feared would dispel the hard work I had done thus far.  I also didn't want to lose my b1 rook as it was part of my plan around the e5 pawn.",
        "23. e6": "Initiation of a plan.",
        "23... f6": "He doesn't take.",
        "24. e7+": "He could have taken with Queen, King or Knight; or, even, he could have moved his king up, which I wouldn't have recommended.",
        "24... Qxe7": "He takes with the queen!",
        "25. Ne6+": "At this point, I didn't yet see a clear path to victory.  It seemed too dependent on what my opponent would do.",
        "25... Ke8": "The only logical choice.  As was correctly pointed out to me by damalfi before I messed with my annotations, Rg17 is actually a very good move.  In the middle of the game, I failed to see what to do if black moved Qd6 in an attempt to save the queen, but this actually paves the way for checkmate.  Next move, bxc5, once more threatening the queen.  If black is aggressive with his queen at this point, he loses it.  Alternatively, if he is passive and moves Qc6 in response, then Rxb8+ leads to victory for white.",
        "26. Nxc5": "I didn't see that and instead went for another \"free\" pawn.  If his queen stuck around for one more turn, I'd have it pinned to his king.",
        "26... Qc7": "I thanked my lucky stars.  With this queen placement, a future fork was soon to be available.",
        "27. Rbe1+": "Check.  His likely moves were either to block with Queen or Knight, or move the King.  At this point, any movement with the king would have given me his queen.",
        "27... Ne7": "A logical choice.",
        "28. Rg7": "Now his knight is pinned two ways.  That is not a situation I'd want to be in myself.  My next move was Bd7+, which would have forced white to trade down and one permutation would yield a win for me, if he went for it.",
        "28... a5": "This didn't do anything to stop my plan.",
        "29. Bd7+": "Yep.  Either black took with the Queen, which would have made us even, or he moved Kd8, which would have made us even, or he moved Kf8, which gave me a win.",
        "29... Kf8": "Well then.",
        "30. Ne6#": "A very, very lucky win for me."
