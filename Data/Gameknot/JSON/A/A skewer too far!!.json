        "1. g3": "Ok, this guy has already beaten me once, so i'm on my guard and out for revenge!!",
        "1... e5": "....",
        "2. e4": "I decide to go with the fianchetto bishop on the king side, i'm starting to use this defense more often but i used to hate it...The reason i a starting to use it more is that i find the g2 h8 diagonal a very potent weapon more often than not. Of course it can backfire when the opposition tries his hardest to exchange the bishop.....",
        "2... Nf6": "The usual response.....",
        "3. Bg2": "i carry on with the plan....",
        "3... Bc5": "Instant pressure on the f3 square...",
        "4. c3": "No need to worry about that just yet so i carry on developing, i can't afford to lose tempo defending reasonably safe squares.....",
        "4... O-O 5. Ne2": "Another move i seem to have adopted recently instead of Nf6 i have found success with Ne2 although usually i link the 2 knights up with Nc3 at some point. This may not be the case in this game.....",
        "5... d5": "Trying to get a firm grip on the center of the board....",
        "6. exd5": "I'm happy to exchange the pawns instantly it may have been better play to adopt a passive stance and continue developing but i don't fancy a huge trade off in the center later on....",
        "6... Nxd5": "......",
        "7. d4": "I decide not to let black gain control of the center and i want to test his mettle, is he up for a fight or will he go passive on me... ",
        "7... exd4": "Bang up for it, you have to admire the fighting spirit and i know i'm in a battle.....",
        "8. cxd4": "No choice really if i want that center all to myself....",
        "8... Bb6": "Unfortunately i have a isolani but i am prepared to pay this price if it means i gain time and space to formulate a decent attack....",
        "9. O-O": "now that my king is safe i can start to position my pieces in a threatening manner, i have no real plan at this point so it's just a case of positional play right now...",
        "9... Nc6 10. a3": "A precautionary move against Nb4 although i don't see d4 lasting much longer...",
        "10... Be6 11. b4": "Not sure exactly why i made this move maybe i can trap the bishop on b6 other than that it's just a pawn push when really i should be rallying the troops....",
        "11... Qf6": "This is starting to look like a meaningful attack, i best be on my guard....",
        "12. Bb2": "everything is pointed at that pawn so i do what i can to add a little more life to it...",
        "12... a6 13. Nd2": "Time to link the 2 rooks up and wake up that knight who spent to long sleeping on b1....",
        "13... Rfe8 14. Ne4": "I throw in a little queen threat, just to be annoying more than anything else, i'm more hoping that my opponent slips up at the mo than going for a particular plan......",
        "14... Qg6 15. Qd2": "Now i have back rank link up lets see what i can do with it.....",
        "15... Rad8": "Think he wants the d file all to himself....",
        "16. Ng5": "This is the set up for a exchange on e6, i may get him to weaken his defences around the king with h6.....",
        "16... h6": "Job done....",
        "17. Nxe6": "Now i may be able to get some sort of advantage if he isn't careful....",
        "17... Qxe6": "Didn't think the queen was gonna go in but it makes no difference...",
        "18. Rfe1": "Lets see if i can create a little danger shall we....",
        "18... Nf6 19. Rac1": "Just wanted to guard the open file here.....",
        "19... Qd6 20. Bf3": "This just stops any ideas of Ng4 and creates a bit of space for the bishop to work in.....",
        "20... Bxd4": "Ok, the big exchange coming up......",
        "21. Nxd4": "Ide rather give up the knight than the bishop here...",
        "21... Nxd4 22. Bxd4 Qxd4": "And he ends up a pawn better off.....and i have a decision to make as to the future of my queen.....",
        "23. Qa2": "I decide i don't want to lose her just yet......",
        "23... Rxe1+ 24. Rxe1": "That stopped Rxc7...for now!",
        "24... b5": "I think i have something a little better than Rc7 in mind for now.....",
        "25. Rd1": "Whoops there it is!! I think we could have a winning move scenario here, i can't see a way to save both of them in fact if it were me i would now go Qxd1, it's his only hope i think unless he feels he can play a rook down with just knight and queen he does have an extra pawn so it may be worth saving the queen if he can come up with something pretty creative in the guise of a pawn push, i don't know actually but my first thought as a response was Qxd1 maybe not the best option now i take it in a bit more, i don't know where i would put the black queen now but i'm sure Macbone will come up with something......",
        "25... Qxd1+": "And he obviously came to the same conclusion as me, great minds and all that...\nWe know the next 2 moves at least.....\n",
        "26. Bxd1 Rxd1+ 27. Kg2": "The only place if only i didn't make the move g3 then it would have all been worth it for Macca, alas i feel confident now of a win. It's just how i go about the win i'm not so confident about!!",
        "27... Rd8": "Back to the home rank where i guess it will be most useful.....",
        "28. Qe2": "Time to try and pick off a few stray pawns.....",
        "28... Rc8": "I guess he realizes what i had in mind......",
        "29. h4": "If all else fails i can always rely on the old trusty pawn push....Note to self, watch out for Nf4 at a later date....",
        "29... c5": "He goes for the push aswel, over the top lads!!",
        "30. bxc5": "I may aswel take it as i can't afford to let him promote so the less black pawns on the board the better.....",
        "30... Rxc5 31. Qe3": "Hopefully i can bully a mistake out of my opponent....",
        "31... Rc8": "Back he goes.....",
        "32. Qb6": "I need to pick off his pawns and i should be able to do this at my leisure.....",
        "32... Rc2": "I see the plan, he wants to take out my pawns from the bottom up...",
        "33. Qxa6": "I can take this pawn and if he decides to go to Ne4 or Ng4 to back up his rook then i have a lovely suprise in store.....",
        "33... Ne4": "A fatal error, there is no going back now, i feel a warm glow envelope me as i realize this came is pretty much safely wrapped up...",
        "34. Qa8+": "A double header he has lost his knight and the only place for his king is h7 which means it's curtains for the rook also.....",
        "34... Kh7": "Sublime!!",
        "35. Qxe4+": "I feel kinda cruel but hey nobody gets hurt (physically anyway) and after all i did lose our first encounter so it's only right i mete out some retribution!! At this point my opponent resigned and i don't blame him. If it were me on the recieving end i'de want to get out of there asap aswel!! A good game and the winner was move 25, after that fatal error it was a matter of ten moves and black collapsed from the onslaught. Good game."
