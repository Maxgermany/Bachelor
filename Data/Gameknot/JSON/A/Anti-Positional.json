        "1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5": "I don't know anything other than the name of Trompovsky's attack. I had just gotten crushed by this same opponent in this same opening so I was eager to get out of the book.\n",
        "2... e6 3. Bxf6 gxf6": "This is I suppose anti-positional but I'm thinking I can castle queenside and he will have to since the open file would be dangerous.  It had to be better than the previous crush.",
        "4. e3 d5": "The e3 is solid but not aggressive.",
        "5. Nf3 Nc6 6. Bb5 Bd7": "Both sides continue to develop.  The f6 pawn prevents Ne5 and may support an e5 push at some time.\n",
        "7. Qe2 Qe7 8. Nc3 O-O-O 9. O-O-O": "So both sides have castled and now we need to find plans.\n",
        "9... a6 10. Bxc6 Bxc6": "I think retreating the bishop would have been better but Nb4 would still allow black the two bishops.  I was a little worried by 10. Bxa6, b7xa6, 11.Qxa6ch, Kb8, 12. Nb5  but I think 12. ..., Qb4 and 13. ..., Qa5 should hold. ",
        "11. Nd2": "Aiming for c5\n",
        "11... e5 12. Nb3 Qe6": "If Nc5 then BxN and black's control of the center should give him a slight advantage.",
        "13. Rhe1 Bb4": "This pins the knight on c3 and gives Black a threat to double the c pawns and weaken the King position.  \n ",
        "14. Nc5": "White probably expects BxNc5 since he seems to have a threat on a6, but black can allow it!\n",
        "14... Qe7 15. Nxa6": "Black can capture that knight but his castled position is ruined and white's queen may be hard to dislodge so...\n",
        "15... Bxc3": "White can save the knight but he will lose the exchange. So...\n",
        "16. bxc3 Qa3+": "Black resigns - The knight falls but white's compensation is minimal.\n"
