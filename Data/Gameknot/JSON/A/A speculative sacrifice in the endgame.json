        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nThis is the third game in the sacrifices theme.  This is a team game.  I got paired up against an opponent nearly 40 points north of my rating.  All seemed lost in the middlegame when I blundered a pawn due to a tactical oversight.  I think this is the only the second time on gameknot I have blundered a pawn to a higher rated opponent and lived to tell the tale, the other was my first ever Master Draw.  So how did all this happen, well read on.",
        "1... d5": "1. ...... d5 - in response to e4 Jiri plays d5 which is the Centre Counter or the Scandinavian Defense.",
        "2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Nxd5": "3. ..... Nxd5 - sometimes the advanced d pawn drops off directly with Qxd5 but then the queen can be a target in the centre in the opening.  However, it is playable and the queen usually lands on a5.  Jiri decided that it was more prudent to develop a knight.",
        "4. Nf3 Bg4": "4. ..... Bg4 - the pieces are coming out quickly.",
        "5. Be2 e6 6. O-O Nc6 7. h3 Bh5 8. c4": "8. c4 - a strike at the knight on d5, now where is that steed going?",
        "8... Nb6 9. Nc3": "9. Nc3 - that knight went to b6.  Now I develop my queen knight to his usual square.",
        "9... Be7 10. Be3": "10. Be3 - development is complete.",
        "10... O-O 11. b3": "11. b3 - to support my pawn on c4.",
        "11... Qd7 12. Qd2": "12. Qd2 - both queens move off the back row to connect our respective rooks.",
        "12... Rad8 13. Rad1 Bb4": "13. ...... Bb4 - a nasty looking pin.  Suddenly my d4 pawn is looking a little vulnerable.",
        "14. Ne5 Nxe5 15. Bxh5 Nc6 16. Qb2": "16. Qb2 - Glenda sidesteps the pin.  I must be careful of my loose bishop on h5 though.",
        "16... Qe7 17. c5 Bxc3 18. Qxc3 Nd5 19. Qb2": "19. Qb2?? - Glenda, what have you done, I think you should have moved to d2 instead.  Now I lose a pawn.",
        "19... Nxe3 20. fxe3": "20. fxe3 - after the N for B trade Fou Leblanc and a pawn on e3 will be attacked by the Wicked Witch next move and so I must yield my e3 pawn.",
        "20... Qg5 21. Bf3": "21. Bf3 - best - you will see how in a minute.",
        "21... Qxe3+ 22. Qf2 Qxf2+ 23. Rxf2 Rxd4 24. Rxd4 Nxd4 25. Bxb7": "25. Bxb7 - a lot has happened over the past 4 moves.  Firstly the queens have been traded and now one pair of rooks.  Fou Leblanc now busts up Jiri's queenside but I must worry about that 4 - 2 kingside majority that Jiri has.  He already has a passer on the e column.",
        "25... c6 26. Ba6 f5 27. Rd2": "27. Rd2 - if only I can prize that pesky horsie off the d column.",
        "27... e5 28. Bc4+ Kh8 29. Kf2": "29. Kf2 - Henry must assist in trying to contain those kingside pawns.",
        "29... g5": "29. ....... g5 - which just keep rolling along.",
        "30. Rb2 e4": "30. ....... e4?! - here is where black starts to go a little awry, I now have an opportunity to rid myself of that knight, even though I will have to trade in Fou Leblanc to do it.",
        "31. Rd2": "31. Rd2 - now, if Rd8? protecting the knight then Ke3 will win back a pawn if f4+.  So he moves the knight to b5.",
        "31... Nb5 32. Bxb5 cxb5": "32. ...... cxb5 - I have got rid of the knight and now my rook has a whole open d column to control.  Although I remain a pawn to the bad my position has improved and I have a passer on c5 to boot.",
        "33. b4": "33. b4 - and I support the passer with b4.",
        "33... Kg7": "33. ..... Kg7?! - here is the speculative sac - returning a pawn.  He wants to get his king into play but he will have to return a pawn.",
        "34. Rd7+ Kf6": "34. ...... Kf6 - note, if Rf7?? then 35. c6! followed by Rxf7 and then Glenda will appear on c8.  If the rook takes on d7 on move 35 then the pawn recaptures and Glenda appears next move on d8.  Jiri does not fall into this trap and wisely advances his king to f6.",
        "35. Rxa7": "35. Rxa7 - I was spoilt for choice but I decided to counter with a 3-1 majority on the queenside.  Was the alternative capture better?  You the jury decide.",
        "35... Rd8 36. Ke2": "36. Ke2 - Henry must stop Rd2+.",
        "36... h5 37. a4 bxa4 38. Rxa4": "38. Rxa4 - I now have two connected passed pawns on the b and c column but what will the BR and the BK do?  I'm about to find out.",
        "38... Rc8": "38. ...... Rc8 - this move holds up the c pawn quite nicely.  If the black king were on g6 and not f6 I may well have had this game in the bag.  My rook must now use up a couple of tempi to protect the passers from the rear - always the best place for your rook when you have passed pawns - defend from behind and not from in front or the side.  Rooks need three things, mobility, mobility and mobility!",
        "39. Ra1 Ke5 40. Rc1 Kd5": "40. ...... Kd5 - my pawns can go no further, but can Jiri's?",
        "41. Kd2 g4 42. hxg4 hxg4": "42. ..... hxg4 - at least the three to one majority on the kingside is close enough for Henry to contain.  Note that if Jiri's king moves onto the fourth rank or one square away from my c pawn, it will advance!",
        "43. Ke3": "43. Ke3 - and draw offer.  I did not think that either side could make progress with our respective pawns.  My opponent agreed and accepted the draw offer, so I came out of this with a High Draw and one rating point, wheew!  Do you think that Jiri's return pawn sacrifice was sound or do you have any other alternatives for him.  You the Inquest Jury decide."
