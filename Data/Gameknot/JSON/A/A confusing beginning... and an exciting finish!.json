        "1. Nf3": "The Reti Opening: my favorite hypermodern approach as white.",
        "1... Nc6": "I expected Nf6 or d5, but this move is new. Wouldn\u2019t recommend it.",
        "2. g3": "I continue developing slowing and fianchettoing.",
        "2... d5": "Now controlling the centre. I think maybe d6 would also be good because the knight can then move to e4.",
        "3. Bg2": "I complete my fianchetto.",
        "3... e5": "Now Anu has complete control of the centre, but I have a nice developed kingside.",
        "4. d3": "Finally developing the queenside now.",
        "4... h6 5. Nbd2 Bc5": "Standard developing",
        "6. h3 Bd7": "Bf5 would have been better, but Anu wanted the queen behind the bishop for the threat of Bxh3 later on. However, I still recommend Bf5.",
        "7. O-O Qc8": "Bxh3 could happen now.",
        "8. Kh2": "Note that if white went another move, and allowed Bxh3, the follow-up could be like 8. ... Bxh3 9. g4 Bxg7 10. Kxg7, leaving black a pawn up. On the other hand, if white went g4 immediately, the kingside would be slightly more exposed with the dangerous h2-b8 diagonal open to attack.",
        "8... Nf6 9. Nb3": "And so the harassment of the black DSB has begun.",
        "9... Bb6 10. a4 a5 11. c4 d4 12. c5 Ba7": "Notice how horribly placed black\u2019s DSB is.",
        "13. Qc2 Be6": "! This threatens 14. ... Bxb3 15. Qxb3 Bxc5 and the DSB is back in the game.",
        "14. Bd2": "Ra3 would have been more safe. I was threatening h5 but didn\u2019t realize that AFTER the combo I mentioned earlier, the rook would be guarding that pawn as well as the knight.",
        "14... Nh7": "And Anu misses the attack.",
        "15. Nxa5": "But my plan (accidentally) works.",
        "15... Nxa5 16. Bxa5 Ng5": "More pressure on h3. My heart is pounding at this point.",
        "17. Ng1": "The only safe move I could think of.",
        "17... h5 18. h4": "Relieving the pressure.",
        "18... Nh7": "Black still hasn\u2019t castled.",
        "19. c6": "Now the DSB is free, but there is a threat along the long h1-a8 diagonal.",
        "19... b6": "...and the DSB is trapped again.",
        "20. Bb4 g5 21. Nf3 f6 22. Qd2 Rg8 23. Ba3 Bd5 24. Qb4": "With the immediate threat of Qe7#. Black should have castled way earlier to avoid this.",
        "24... Rg7": "Now the key is the Nh7.",
        "25. Nxg5": "!! A beautiful discovered attack!",
        "25... fxg5": "The only move.",
        "26. Bxd5 gxh4 27. Bg8": "Ha-ha! Now black is in a real pickle. If the rook moves off the 7th rank, you\u2019re doomed; if your knight is taken off the board, Qf8 kills you.",
        "27... hxg3+": "The last chance...",
        "28. fxg3": "!! Now the f1 rook has the whole f-file to itself!",
        "28... Qg4": "A tempo too late.",
        "29. Rf8+": "!!!",
        "29... Nxf8 30. Qxf8#": "Whew! That was an amazing, exciting game between Anu and I. My heart was POUNDING LIKE CRAZY! Hope you enjoyed!"
