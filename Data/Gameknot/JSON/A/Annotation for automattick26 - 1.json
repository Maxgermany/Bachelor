        "1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Bc4": "?  After ... dxe5 White is badly overextended (or ... Nb6, costing White the tempo).  Theory recommends Nf3 (the Modern Variation of Alekhine's Defense) or c4, continuing the chase.  Generally, I'm opposed to bringing a Bishop out to c4 this early (blocks the c pawn), but that's mostly just me.",
        "4... Nb6 5. Be2": "Bb3 would hold the Knight a little better, but e2 is not a bad place for him to be.  A little passive, but it avoids the problems with a bad Queen exchange after 5. Bb3 dxe5.",
        "5... dxe5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+ 7. Bxd1": "An awkward position, giving Black a lead in development but also something of a foregone conclusion after 4. Bc4.",
        "7... e6 8. Bf3": "? Now blocking the Knight in the \"g\" in favor of another passive development of the same Bishop.  Nf3 with a mind to castling seems preferrable; f4 may also have some promise (restoring White's claim to the center).  b3 could also be considered for its prophylactic effect on the Knight.",
        "8... Nc4 9. Nc3": "Good eye for development, but at the cost of a pawn.  Bf4 is ugly, but saves the pawn - for now.",
        "9... Nxe5 10. Nb5": "Nice threat, but with Black having the tempo you're open to a zwischenzung, a la Nxf3.  Then you lose a Bishop for a Knight (I prefer Bishops, because at three squares distant they can cover all of a Knight's forward motion), and Black is still free to guard c7.",
        "10... Na6": "?  Awkward at best.  With Queens traded in, Kd8 might not be all bad, although Bd6 seems best to me (Nxd6 may cause problems, but the ensuing cxd6 presents a formidable pawn center).",
        "11. Ne2": "?  Bf4 was the correct answer here.  The Knight finds itself pinned against the weak c pawn, and White is free to castle long into the open file.  Also, removing the Night from g1 allows Nxf3, doubling and isolating the f and g pawns (and slowing your development, although with each player already having attempted a lone Knight rush, I don't think development was foremost in anyone's mind here).",
        "11... Nxf3+ 12. gxf3 Bd7 13. Ned4": "?  Although it parries the immediate threat, the Knight at d4 is neither secure nor does it solve the problem at c7.  Pieces in the center normally need to be attacking, or one risks being overloaded.  a4 seems like a safer bet, since Black now has an arsenal of potent responses - c5, e5, Bc4, O-O-O.",
        "13... e5 14. Nxc7+": "Winning some compensation.  A good answer to a bad situation.",
        "14... Nxc7": "White is in a conundrum now, having lost the Knight and being forced to retreat from the center because of the influence of the black Bishop.",
        "15. Nb3 Bc6 16. Nd2": "Using a tempo to defend a doubled pawn seems to me, in this case, a poor choice (especially since it also impedes the Bishop).  f4 doesn't save the pawn, but it might get a good trade out of it - and develop that Bishop simultaneously.  It might also be time to accept the lost point and spin the wheel by doing something [seemingly] random like c4, Nc5, or O-O.",
        "16... Nb5 17. a4": "I would have ignored the attack and castled straightaway, possibly allowing your King to guard the f pawns and definitely centering your Rooks.",
        "17... Nd4 18. c3": "?  Missing the fork.  Black's attack also illustrates the problem with trying to defend doubled pawns while short on pieces: overwhelming attacks.",
        "18... Nc2+ 19. Kd1 Nxa1 20. b3": "Not helping.  Not that there was much to be salvaged by now, but for what it is worth Ne4 was probably best.  If the Bishop traded in for your Knight, it would center a pawn and possibly allow your \"c\" Bishop to see some action.",
        "20... Nxb3 21. Nxb3 Bxf3+ 22. Ke1": "Alekhine's Defense can get tricky very quickly since it seems like such a dumb idea that many players don't run into it often.  I don't really fault your lack of opening theory, but always remember to develop a solid position rather than running after fleeting hopes.  Although the enemy Knight can be attacked, don't do it if the attack damages the gradual maturing of your own position.  Although your pieces can be defended, be willing to retreat if you are facing a substantial counterattack.  And above all, grasp, hold, and defend the center with pieces!  Get your Knights out early, and your Rooks centered.  And of course, be ever hopeful - in this world you will have tribulation, but we follow One who has overcome this world. [John 16:33]"
