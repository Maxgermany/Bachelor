        "1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4": "Accelerated London system. \nResembling the Colle System, white develops the Bishop to Bc1-f4 the hallmark of the London. The orthodox move order has always been on the 3rd move, e.g., 1. d4 2. Nf3 3. Bf4 to what ever Black plays. The Accelerated London develops the bishop on move 2.\n\nI'm not a Londoner so I'm not going to write the pros and cons of The orthodox London vs the accelerated London system and how it is meant to deal with Black's moves. I just know it's really in vogue right now and a hot opening for White because Magnus Carlsen\nhas played it.  \n\nI will add black will face a blunted King's Indian Defense if both sides were to develop their own system, i.e., The london system vs the King's Indian Defense. \nFor example, 1. d4...Nf6 2. Nf3...g6 3. Bf4...Bg7 4. e3...d6 5. Be2..0-0 6. 0-0. \n",
        "2... c5": "This gambit line is similar to the Benoni's. ",
        "3. e3 Nd5": "A novelty? \nAs you can realize, If black were to have played 2..g6, then 3 e3...Nd5 doesn't work because white can play 4. Be5! Thus, gaining a tempo and would create holes in Black's pawn structure 4...f6 or double pawns on the F-file if Black plays 4....Nf6. ",
        "4. Bg3 Qb6": "The mainline of this gambit system for Black. ",
        "5. b3 cxd4 6. exd4 g6": "Now Black develops King side fianchetto and castle. ",
        "7. Be5 Nf6": "Queen supports Knight and keeps pawns intact. ",
        "8. Nf3 Bg7 9. c3": "A rather poor move for White at this mid stage of the opening. \nBetter is 9. Be2 10. 0-0 ",
        "9... O-O": "Hyper development!\nnimzovich, Reti, Tartakower. ",
        "10. Be2 d6": "! \nBlack gains tempo",
        "11. Bf4": "A poor square for the Bishop. \nMore harmonious for White would be 11. Bg3 as it remains protected",
        "11... e5": "Another gambit within a gambit!\nThis opens lines for the c, d, e Files and the a1-h8 diagonal for black.  ",
        "12. dxe5 dxe5 13. Bxe5 Nc6": "Again black gains tempo. \nThis protects the d4 square, preventing Bd4 attacking queen. ",
        "14. Bf4": "??\nThe bishop has moved 5 times in 14 moves!",
        "14... Rd8": "Again Black gains tempo and controls the d-file and attacks the Queen. \nBlacks has 5 develop pieces to White's 3 pieces. \nWhite has lost control of the four 4 key squares, e4, d4, e5, d5",
