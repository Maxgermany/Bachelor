        "1. e4": "My usual opening",
        "1... c5 2. Nc3": "The Closed Sicilian. ",
        "2... Nc6 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 d6 5. Nge2": "I like the closed Sicilian cos even though move orders can vary the basic idea for white is simple. Control d5, castle, then attack kings side with f4 (usually)",
        "5... e5": "I didn't mind seeing this. d5 is now firmly under my control",
        "6. O-O Be7": "Usually black opts to develop his black bishop to g7. This is not as good I dont think.",
        "7. d3": "I slowly develop along familiar lines.",
        "7... Bg4": "I don't get this. It gives me a chance to defend g4 against a future Ng4 and makes room for my king on h2 without losing a tempo.",
        "8. h3 Be6 9. f4": "I start my k-side initiative.",
        "9... O-O 10. f5": "I prefer to gain space rather than open up the middle.",
        "10... Bd7 11. g4": "freeing g3 for my knight",
        "11... Rc8": "So he begins operations on my q-side. I think I'm better. I have lots of k-side space for my attack. I don't think he has played too well here. If he had a pawn on g6 with a  fianchettoed bishop behind it, and his e-pawn on e6 not e5, I would not have been able to play f5 so easily. I believe his position is cramped and I am gaining in confidence by this point.",
        "12. Ng3": "I want to play g5 but I didn't want Nh5 stopping my Ng3 so I played it first.",
        "12... Ne8": "Still cant play g5. So I attack his black sq bishop.",
        "13. Nd5 Bh4 14. Kh2": "I defend the knight and free the g-file in case its later possible to get a rook or two on it.",
        "14... b5 15. Be3": "Once again I try to pave the way for g5. I plan Qd2.",
        "15... Ne7 16. Nxe7+": "This I thought was better than allowing Nxd5. ",
        "16... Qxe7 17. Qd2": "So now I am ready for g5.",
        "17... h6": "I was really surprised at this. It just seems to invite an attack.",
        "18. Nh5": "I thought I'd get my knight into position first. Then I'm thinking doubled rooks, Bxh6 followed by Qxh6 then g5 !",
        "18... Nf6": "Again, I was surprised cos now I take the initiative.",
        "19. Nxg7 Kxg7 20. Bxh6+ Kh8": "I took a while here cos I wanted to to play g5 now but I was worried about Nh5, so I decide to take the material.",
        "21. Bxf8 Rxf8": "Here, I also took a long time. I was eyeing g5 (still !) but I was very worried about unleashing the knight to work in conjunction with his bishop and queen around my king. I started thinking that my k-side pawns were OK where they were. His pieces were sort of stifled and blocking each other a bit. I wanted to get my rooks going so...",
        "22. b4": "I decided to start play on the q-side. Any comments on this decision would be welcome.",
        "22... cxb4 23. Qxb4 Rc8": "I should have defended c2 here.",
        "24. a4": ".. but I didnt want to lose time. I planned c4 after bxa4. or if he didnt take it, pxp and the a-file for my rooks",
        "24... a5": "I was surprised at this at first but I think he wanted to play Rxc2 without being attacked straight away by my queen. I should have refused and dropped back to d2 then Rc1",
        "25. Qxa5": "...but I didnt !",
        "25... Rxc2 26. axb5 Nxg4+": "The killer blow. Never saw it coming - even now I didnt see the continuation.",
        "27. hxg4 Bf2": "... and now I'm lost. ",
        "28. Qa8+": "I thought for a minute I'd found something but I was wrong.",
        "28... Kg7": " so I resign. Well Played !"
