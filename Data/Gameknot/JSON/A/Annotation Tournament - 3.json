        "1. Nc3": "Not much played, I was curious about what our Captain would find against the 'van Geet' (or 'Dunst' as it is sometimes known).",
        "1... d5 2. e4 e5": "OK, that's a new one. The common continuation is 2...d4 3.Nce2 e5 at which point White can do 4.Ng3 with fair play.\nChecking with GK and offline DBs, the game move has been played before - but with uniformly disastrous results by Black. Taking with the pawn gives him counterplay however; the knight capture is definitely safer.\n",
        "3. Nxd5 Nf6 4. Bc4": "?! There are a couple of other games in the database and both went for 4.Nxf6. At the time it seemed to me that exchanging the knights offered Black far too much counterplay, as after 4.Nxf6+ Qxf6 5.Nf3 Bc5 6.Be2 Bg4 7.O-O Nc6 8.d3 O-O-O Black has the freer game, initiative, and pressure against White's king position. The drawbacks of not exchanging the knights were less apparent to me at the time. Taught by painful experience, I can now say that not exchanging knights is a definite, strategic mistake: it is dangerous to keep that piece in play, in the kind of position which Black gains by this pawn sacrifice.\n",
        "4... Nxe4 5. Qe2 Nd6 6. Qxe5+": "I studied this move for a long time before settling for it. White is literally putting his head into a nest of wasps here. Black gets significant development and a lot of mobile threats against both White's queen and the weak c2 and g2 squares- But - significantly - in two extended key lines (one of which we see played out in this game) it seemed to me that White was able to hold on to the advantage despite this.",
        "6... Be6": "This is one of those lines. The game now follows my analysis up until move 11, at which point Black throws me a curve...",
        "7. Ne3": "?! The computer flags this as a mistake, preferring instead 7.Bb3 with a small plus to White. However, I disliked the situation after 7... Nc6 8.Qf4 g5, where Black seems able to hunt the White queen at will.",
        "7... Nxc4 8. Nxc4": "One knight down, one more to go ...",
        "8... Nc6 9. Qe4": "Not 9.Qe2 Nd4 10.Qd3 Bf5 11.Qe3+ Be7 =+",
        "9... Qe7": "White's problem here is that Black gets all the development while White has difficulty parking his Queen anywhere useful. That, along with the open e-file down to the still uncastled king, is a major worry at this point. During the game I was still confident that I would be able to ride this out, but looking at the situation today I believe Black has full compensation for the pawn; certainly I would have no qualms playing Black's side of the board. Indeed, the computer evaluation shows a minor plus for Black.",
        "10. Ne3": "This was the move I relied on to save the situation: from e3 the knight shields its exposed king and defends the major weaknesses on c2 and g2. I considered and rejected two alternatives:\nA) 10.Ne2 f5! and I considered White's position to be lost beyond recovery.\nB) 10.b3 Bxc4 11.Qxe7+ Bxe7 12.bxc4 Nd4 13.Kd1 and White may, at best, have equal play.",
        "10... f5 11. Qa4 O-O-O": "! And this is where I got the first nasty surprise. I hadn't really looked at this option, disregarding it on strategic grounds: \"Black cannot castle long, because he will be castling straight into the side of the board where White has an advantage in both space and active officers!\"\nExcept, of course, that White's \"advantage in space and active officers\" amounts to one piece only: a queen, \"actively\" chased about the board by those pesky light officers of Black's...\nWhat Black gains by this operation is quite interesting: king safety, instant control of the d-file, added pressure on White's uncastled king position, full development of the rook. Count the number and color of active pieces on the board for a moment: White has two, Black has six! (yes, the pawn is an active piece too in this situation). I believe the GK analysis understates Black's advantage when it calculates it to a mere 0.47 pts.",
        "12. Ne2 Kb8 13. f4": "I regarded this move as practically forced. My game notes...\n\"So right now I am seriously worrying about the exposed state of my king. Well, actually that has been a worry since move 5 or so! And I am considering what to do about it. His move could signal a desire to move the knight (probably to b4, possibly to e5), and I have to look out for queen traps then. And I learned early on in my chess career that castling to different sides meant the person whose pawns reached the king first would have a general advantage... So, what to do? Well, I would *love* to castle long, even if that does mean that my one-pawn advantage is lessened a bit. But I don't think I will actually have the chance to do that.\n- 13.b2-b3 is a no-go on strategic grounds, as he will just exchange the dark bishops and have an open avenue to my king.\n- 13.d2-d4 is blocked, unless I prepare by c3 first.\n- 13.c2-c3 is also a no-go, as it leads to the unravelling of my kingside. Main line: 13.c3 Rd3 14.Nf4 Rd8 15.d4 g5 16.Ne2 f4 17.Nc4 f3 -/+\n- 13.d2-d3 does not inspire a lot of confidence either, I think. The only thing going for it is that it allows Bc1-d2, and I think I know  who is the better after 13.d3 g5 14.Bd2 f4 15.Nc4 Bxc4 16.Qxc4 Re8 17.Qe4 Qxe4 18.dxe4 Rxe4 - and it sure ain't me!\nHowever, the GK analysis points to d3 as being the best option after all, after 13.d3 g5 14.f4! gxf4 15.Qxf4 Bg7 16.O-O Rhe8 17.Rf2 Nd4 18.Nxd4 Bxd4 19.c3 Bc5 with practically equal play.",
        "13... Qh4+ 14. g3 Qh5 15. d3": "White's position grows more untenable by the move, but this doesn't really help much. White, of course, cannot castle (the knight is hanging), and the only reasonable alternative I could see was 15.c3, in order to facilitate d2-d4, cutting off the dangerous g1-a7 diagonal. However, on 15.c3 there would likely follow 15...Bd5 16.Nxd5 Rxd5 and now the sought-for d2-d4 looks more than creating a nice tomb for the king than erecting bolvarks of defence.\nThe possibility of d2-d4 never entered my mind - it looked (and looks) like it simply cuts off the queen from further influence on the 4th row while adding nothing to the safety of the king. Now, GK claims it is the path to (relative) safety, after: 15.d4 Be7 16.Bd2 Bf6 17.c3 Rhe8 18.Qb5 Qf3 19.Rf1 Qe4 20.a4 Bd5 21.O-O-O a6. But if you happen to play out that line however, you may notice that the computer - being at the very limit of its event horizon - miss the deadly continuation 22.Qc5 (forced) 22...Be7 and White can resign: the queen is trapped.",
        "15... Bc5": "Adding to the pressure on White's position.",
        "16. Bd2": "My game notes at the time: \"The point of this move is not quite what you'd expect: it isn't an attempt at castling long - that's still not possible - rather, it is preparatory to Ke1-f2 and Ra1-e1, in order to shore up e3 and the e-file in general. Also, b2-b4 is now in the cards.\"\nAs they stand, those comments are still true. However, the position is almost hopeless; the only real hope for White, at this point, is to create a sufficiently double-edged position that Black may make a mistake. A measure of how unbalanced the game is at this point, with White still nominally a pawn ahead, is the \"best\" line given by GK: 16. g4 fxg4 17. f5 Bd5 18. Nxd5 Rxd5 19. Ng3 Qh3 20. Kd1 Re8 21. Bf4 Qg2 22. Kc1 Rxf5 23. Nxf5 Qxh1+ ... and White loses the rook.",
        "16... Rhe8 17. b4": "White attempts to create threats against Black's king. Not extremely plausible, but better than the slow and sure strangulation offered by GK's line 17.O-O-O...",
        "17... Bxe3": "Taking on b4 would give White a half-open line directly to Black's king.",
        "18. Bxe3 Bd5": "And White can no longer prevent Black penetrating into his camp.",
        "19. O-O": "Sacrifices a piece. However, nothing really works at this point. I had finally decided against resigning however, as I wanted Alex to have chance at giving a nice mate.",
        "19... Rxe3 20. Nc3 Qh3 21. Rf2 Rxg3+": "Yes, exactly.",
