        "2... Bd6": "I see it as mistake. getting pawn and building position on d4 is better response. Also that this bishop is locked in cage, with nothing-having-to-do pawn on d7. ",

        "4. Nf3 c5": "No, moving pawn on two times, thank you for dead move! I wouldn't beat him with pawn on d5 to not lost position and keep Bishop dead.",
