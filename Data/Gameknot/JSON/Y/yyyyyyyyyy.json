        "1. e4": "This was one of my better if not my best game. It's pretty short, but I developed pieces well and didn't fall into attacking too soon like I usually do. So I annotated this mostly to remind myself what can happen when you just develop pieces with some patience. ",
        "1... e5 2. c3": "This may become my pet starting point from now on. It works great if you carefully develop pieces.",
        "2... Bc5": "Black takes on the strategy I usually take, attack from the beginning.",
        "3. Nf3": "safe, but developing move. No sense in moving the other knight, because then black could capture it and I don't want to lose pieces so soon.",
        "3... Qf6": "Brought his queen out. There are more possibilities for black to attack now, but his most valuable piece becomes a target early in the game.",
        "4. b4": "Chasing his bishop away, also creates place for my other knight to move without being captured. His development is now slowed.",
        "4... Bb6": "His bishop moves away.",
        "5. Na3": "The knight moves safely.",
        "5... c6 6. Nc4": "Have more options at attacking the middle of the board with knight here, specifically pawn e5.",
        "6... Bc7": "His bishop moves back to protect e5.",
        "7. d4": "Again, developing pieces.",
        "7... d6": "This move starts my setup. Its the right move because it whoever controls the e5 square will most likely control the middle of the board at this point.",
        "8. Bg5": "His queen was exposed, now he is being chased. There is also only one place queen can move to in order to protect the e5, e6.",
        "8... Qe6": "Moves his queen to e6, as expected. but it opens up the path to d8 for my bishop.",
        "9. dxe5": "Capture e5. ",
        "9... dxe5": "As expected, he captures my e5 w/ pawn.",
        "10. Ncxe5": "My knight captures e5, which black c7 bishop can capture with. ",
        "10... Bxe5": "He does.",
        "11. Qd8#": "My queen has been long given a pathway to d8 after he captured my e5 with his pawn. My queen is protected by bishop on g5. His bishop on c7 was obstacle. But when he captured my knight, it was checkmate. This was a good game on my part. But black also made some bad moves by exposing his power pieces too soon. But in whatever situation, developing pieces early makes attacking late much more effective and gives you much more options, too. Obviously everyone knows that, but way too often I don't go by that. The lure of attacking is too much sometimes. this game is a way to remind myself to resist it and diligently develop pieces."
