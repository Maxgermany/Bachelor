        "6. g4 Be4 7. f3 Bg6 8. Bg2 Bd6 9. Nge2 Nb4 10. e4 c6 11. a3 Qb6": "THAT was the main mistake they made. It was queen suicide to throw the queen in an area made to crush/restrict the knight. Tho', it DID get my attention off of the Knight for a while... :P",
        "12. Na4 Qb5 13. Nec3 Bg3+ 14. Kd2 Qc4 15. Ke3 O-O 16. Bf1 Nxc2+": "THAT was the SECOND bad move this person made... Now she (I think) lost a knight AND the queen!",
        "17. Qxc2 e5": "That confused me to no end...\r\nHer too, from the comments she made later... <:)",

        "27... fxe5+ 28. Kg2 hxg6 29. Bxg5 Rd6 30. Qxe5 Nc4": "THAT caught me off guard...",
        "31. Qe7": "Here I got greedy. Watch as it costs me my queen in the next few turns.",
        "31... Rf7 32. Qe8+ Rf8": "If my queen's a gonner anyways...",
        "33. Qe6+ Rxe6 34. Nxe6": "I'll make 'er pay through the nose for it! AND get a good position, too.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw this, she realized that winning was out of the question for her (I had both rooks, both knights, a bishop and the same number of pawns) and resigned. All in all, It was a REALLY fun game! I enjoyed it a lot and would enjoy playing her again, anytime!!!"
