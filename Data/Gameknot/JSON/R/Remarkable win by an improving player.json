        "23... Rd2": "Black casually moves his rook to d2 as he eyes down my knight with both his rook and his bishop. I have to move one of my knights..Which one?",

        "27... Rd5": "I don't think this was a good move by black to retreat his rook and go for my knight. a better move would be to check my again with his queen by going black queen to e8. Instead he moves his rook to d5. ",
        "28. Qxg7+": "You probably saw this coming. Its the move I was waiting on. I check his king at the same time his rook is threatened and I am protected by the knight on f5. At this point not much he can do but follow my lead.",
