        "6... h5": "did you guess h5? Guys, why cant he just take the knight? Think about it before looking at the next moves? ......................7. hxg4 hxg4 the knight is en prise. So where does it go? 8. Nh2 Qh4!! Threatening mate if the knight moves or stays put. 9. f3 to escape g3! ouch!!!",
        "7. d3 Qf6": "Ganging up on the knight. We have already ascertained he cant take it.",
        "8. Nbd2 Bc5": "I usually play 8.......Ne7 to go to g6 and then f4, but this looked inviting",
        "9. b3": "Never seen this move before. Obviously he wants to get his bishop active.",
        "9... Bd4 10. Rb1 Ne7 11. Qe1 Bc3": "I like pins.",
