        "3. Nf3": "Giving up a pawn for position.  You will see later how important this move is.  Plan is to get the knight to e5",
        "3... dxe4 4. Ne5": "Plan to leave the knight there to threaten f7 and d7",
        "4... Qd5": "Too early to move the queen.  Now i get to chase her around and gain some valuble development at the same time.",
        "5. Bc4": "Pushing her around.",
        "5... Qa5+ 6. Bd2": "As you can see.  I have now developed both bishops and black is running around.",
        "6... Qb6 7. Bc3": "This a1 diagonal will open up if my plan succeeds.  Plan to threaten the g7 pawn.",
        "7... Nc6": "Trying to threaten the d4 pawn.  But it is sufficiently supported.",
        "8. O-O": "Castle kingside to ensure my own safety.  Safety first.  If my attack loses wind then I wont be too out of position.",
        "8... Bd7": "I was very happy to see this move.  I capture the bishop with my knight.  which was placed early on in the game planning for this position. This is where i knew the game was mine. :-)",
        "9. Nxd7": "Black has to recapture with the king, or move his queen.  The black queen has no safe squares and no significant chances of counter attack so the capture of the black queen was definately going to happen if he didn't capture with his king.",
        "9... Kxd7": "Forced!",
        "10. d5": "A double check to come. :-)",
        "10... Na5": "Trying to save the knight but its all over.",
        "11. dxe6+": "Double check.  Black cant capture the pawn with his f7 pawn because of the check from the white queen.  Black cant block the check with Bd6 because of the check from the e6 pawn. Black has to move.  Only choices are ....Ke7 12. Qd7   or ....Ke8 12. Qd7   or Kc8... 12 Qd7 Kb8 13. Qd8  \r\nBlack resigned!!  This was a memorable victory because it was my highest rating I won against and it was a quick victory."
