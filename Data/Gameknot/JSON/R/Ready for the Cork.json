        "1. e4": "A mini-tournament game, I'm playing white and begin with the open game.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "Ruy Lopez, my favorite. I wish more players would let me play it...",
        "3... d6 4. O-O": "3. ... d6?! is the Old Steinitz Defense, not a popular line these days, with most masters preferring to defer d6 by playing 3. ... a6 first. The move as played is acceptable, and many famous champions (including Steinitz, of course) played it, but it gives up the center to white, and more modern analysis of the Ruy Lopez has found better lines for black.",
        "4... Bd7 5. c3 a6 6. Ba4": "Inevitable.",
        "6... Nf6 7. Re1": "Protecting the pawn on e4.",
        "7... Be7 8. d3 O-O 9. Nbd2": "On the way to g3.",
        "9... h6 10. Nf1 Nh7 11. Ng3": "Just in time for the upcoming exchanges.",
        "11... f5 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. Nxf5": "This poor knight ran a long way from b1 just to die here on f5.",
        "13... Rxf5 14. d4 Bg5 15. Bc2 Rf6 16. Qd3": "Subtle, really subtle... Black will never see this one coming. Well, it could happen... Or, really all white expected to do was get his queen a little more centralized with tempo.",
        "16... g6 17. dxe5 Nxe5 18. Qd5+": "How's that for centralized? It even wins a pawn.",
        "18... Kg7 19. Nxe5 dxe5 20. Qxe5 Bxc1 21. Raxc1": "Thank you black, for trading a strong bishop for white's weak bishop, connecting white's rooks, getting the trapped white rook on a1 into the game, and trading material when white is ahead by a pawn. I think I'm giving 20. ... Bxc1? a question mark, though truth be told, black didn't have much better.",
        "21... Ng5 22. Rcd1 Qf8 23. Rd7+": "22. ... Qf8 allows the white rook to slide on up to the 7th rank. But any other queen move would have allowed white to play 23. Qe7+ so black chose the lesser of two weavels. Really, at this point, black is all bottled up and ready for the cork.",
        "23... Nf7 24. Bb3 Re8 25. Qxe8": "Black was pretty much done for. With his rook pinned on f6, it was no help in the defense of the knight on f7, so black was powerless to stop 25. Rxf7+, forking his king and queen. Moving his king away from g7 would break the pin on the rook, but would also remove the rook's only protector, allowing 25. Qxf6. But 24. ... Re8 solves those problems by creating a new one: the loss of a rook and a knight. Still, black had nothing better, so I'll spare the ? for the move.",
        "25... Qxe8 26. Rxe8 g5 27. Ree7": "White is up a rook+pawn, and about to gain a knight, too.",
        "27... Kf8 28. Rexf7+ Rxf7 29. Rxf7+": "Somewhere there's a fat lady singing. Black's king is trapped on the 8th rank (he can escape via a2 but white is about to put an end to that bolt-hole). All black can do is wait for white's king to come finish the mating combination.",
        "29... Ke8 30. Rxc7 b6 31. f4": "Bold-hole closed.",
        "31... gxf4 32. Kf2 h5 33. Kf3 b5 34. Kxf4": "Almost there.",
        "34... a5 35. Ke5 a4 36. Bf7+": "Here white announced mate in 4 and entered the conditional moves, starting with 36. Bf7+. However, in revisiting this game, I discovered there was a mate in 3 I could have played instead: 36. Be6+ Kd8 37. Kd6 (any) 38. Rc8#, or if black tries anything else for his 36th move, 37. Kf6 (any) 38. Rc8#. Oh well, 3 would have been prettier, but 4 worked well enough for the win.",
        "36... Kf8 37. Kf6": "But black speeded things up a bit. Final position. 36. ... Kd8 37. Kd6 (any) 38. Be6 (any) 39. Rc8# was a bit longer but gets the same result."
