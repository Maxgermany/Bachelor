        "1... e5": "Possibly the weakest move on the board. Black just gives up a pawn for virually nothing, except a few cheap tricks.",
        "2. dxe5": "So I take",
        "2... Nc6": "He hits the pawn",
        "3. Nf3": "I protect",
        "3... Qe7": "He hits it again.",

        "7. e4": "So I carry on with my plan",
        "7... d5": "So this was his idea",
        "8. exd6 e.p.": "Perhaps simply e4xd5 was better.",

        "9... b5": "He hits my queen again.",
        "10. Bxb5": "This is almost forced, but good! if now cxb5 11. Nxb5 Nxc2+ 12. Kd1 Nxa1 13. Nc7+ Kd8 14. Qe8# so he distracts my queen\r\n",
        "10... Nxc2+": "I take, although Kd1 is also playable, I thought this was clearer.",

        "13. Qe4": "But this shot saves the knight and leads me a clear two pawns up with a dominating position",
        "13... Rb8": "So he moves the rook",
        "14. Na4": "I hit his queen",
        "14... Qa5": "He hits the knight",

        "24. Qxf6": "I take",
        "24... Re8+": "He  throws in a check. OK stop. What would you do in this position?",
        "25. Be3": "This is actually a mistake and gives him a chance to get off the hook. He could now play Rxe3+ 26. fxe3 Bg3+ 27. hxg3 Qxf6 and he is still in the game. I saw this after I played it, but kept my calm demeanour, and thankfully he didn't notice.",
        "25... Qd3": "I am nto sure what exactly this threatens!",
        "26. Qxf7+": "So I pick up a pawn with check.",

        "29... Bc5": "Threatening Qf7 check",
        "30. Rd1+": "I check",
        "30... Ke7": "He moves out. I think Kc6 struggles on for longer, but it is hopeless.",
        "31. Rf1": "So I protect f2 and have a threat of my own.",
        "31... a5": "Which he seems to miss",
