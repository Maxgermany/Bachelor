        "12. exf6 Nxf6": "The computer doesn't like this one.  It suggests: Best: +1.96 \u00bb \u2026 gxf6 12.  Bf4  O-O  13. Qd5+ Kh8  14. Rad1 Be8  15. h3 Qxd5  16. Nxd5 Nge5  17. Nxe5 Nxe5  18. Nxb6 Bxb5  19. Nxa8 Bxf1  20. Nxc7.\n\nThe suggested line leaves white up a pawn.",

It seems that there is no immediate threats that white can make against black's king.  It took me a while to find my 15th move.\nComputer suggests: Best: +6.08 \u00bb \u2026 Kf8 14.  Nd5  Be8  15.

        "15. Nd5": "Now, no matter blacks move, white wins at least a piece.",
        "15... h6": "And this move allows the forced mate.  I would have suggested 15...Be6 for black.  After 16 Nf4+ Kf7 17. Bxe6+ Kf8, black seems to have a respite from the attack.\n\nComputer disagrees again: Best: +12.61 \u00bb \u2026 Bxf2+ 15.  Kxf2  Ng4+  16. Kg3 Qxg5  17. Nxg5 Nge5  18. Nf3 Nxf3  19. Qxf3 Rhe8  20.
