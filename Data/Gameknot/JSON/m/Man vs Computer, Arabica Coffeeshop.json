        "1. e4 e5 2. Bc4": "I am playing the Bishop Opening against the computer on a higher level where this is my first good result. I evaluated various alternatives and found a few good moves which produce a sound opening. Symbols I use: ^ with the idea of, --> target, tactical significance, -/-> refutes or counters an oppoent idea, and then the usual ! ? + - = symbols.\n",
        "2... Nf6": "^ ...Nxe4\n",
        "3. d3": "I have reviewed a Kasparov game where he played d3, and even though my game deviates for black because the computer plays the reasonably strong ...Nc6, I do like this move.\n",
        "3... Nc6": "^ ...Nd4\n",
        "4. Nf3": "-/-> ...Nd4\n",
        "4... Be7": "The computer wastes no time in castling.\n",
        "5. Nc3": "My strategy is to attack kingside because that is where black is assumed to be castling. I want to obtain 0-0-0 so I can play a kingside pawn storm.\n",
        "5... O-O 6. d4": "!? The idea is to weaken any central strong points for black and to open up some lines that I hope to use to advantage.\n",
        "6... Nxd4 7. Nxd4 exd4 8. Qxd4": "Now material is cleared and there is only a single black knight, which I consider to reduce good counterplay by black. But the computer does try to generate some threats over the next few moves, but it is not considering the position that deeply.\n",
        "8... c5": "A strong move where black fights to gain better control of the center while gaining some tempo. I saw Qd1 as a reply, but was considering playing the queen on the kingside and did not want to risk an early queen trade.\n",
        "9. Qe5": "!? An unusual looking move with the idea of Qg3 after ...d6\n",
        "9... d6 10. Qg3 Bg4": "?! The computer makes a positionally unsound move which allows good counterplay by white.\n",
        "11. f3 Be6 12. Be2": "! Not trading bishops and so not opening up a half open file for the rook.\n",
        "12... Nh5": "The computer continues to play with aggressive attacking kingside play, but it seems like it should be playing more on the queenside. ...Nf4 attacking the bishop is a consideration after the queen moves away.\n",
        "13. Qf2 Bh4": "? Missing the better ...Nf4, this move is weak and is refuted easily.\n",
        "14. g3 Bg5": "? Another unsound move which probably hopes for the weak reply of Bxg5 followed by ...Qxg5 and a good game for black.\n",
        "15. f4 Nxg3": "?? The computer attempts to swindle and tries a cheap tactic. If Qxg3 ?? then ...Bh4 ! wins for black.\n",
        "16. hxg3": "This is the much better reply which simply gains white material. +/-\n",
        "16... Bf6 17. Bd2": "Now looked like a good time to castle because the d file could be opened up and I did not want my king to be caught in the center. This move enables 0-0-0.\n",
        "17... Bd4": "A cheap shot.\n",
        "18. Qh2": "! Trading psychological punches. Of course the computer does not let it show on its silicon face.\n",
        "18... h6": "Essential, but creates a little weakness in the castle.\n",
        "19. f5": "! Shuts out the bishop and pushes a pawn further into the kingside attack.\n",
        "19... Bd7 20. g4": "? I miss a better move 20.Bxh6 ! where mate could follow after (20...gxh6 21.Qxh6 Qf6 22.Qh7#) The text move is a slow attack on h6 and creates a weakness that black finds readily.\n",
        "20... Be5": "The arguement against 19.g4\n",
        "21. Qh3 Bc6": "Attacking a future weakness. The e4 pawn is only safe for the moment.\n",
        "22. g5": "!? Taking a chance and launching a blunt attack on the castle. Hoping my sense of timing and position make this move good.\n",
        "22... Bxc3 23. Bxc3": "--> g7, The text move is better than 23.bxc3 because of ...Qb6+, a pawn is sacrificed in the process to be able to obtain a good attack.\n",
        "23... Qxg5 24. Bd2": "! Not played in retribution, but to allow 0-0-0.\n",
        "24... Qf6 25. O-O-O": "Essential because b2 was hanging.\n",
        "25... Bxe4": "Black obtains another pawn, which seems bad, and normally may be, but in this position white has an additional piece which if played well will make up for lost pawns. Black has equalized materially to a degree.\n",
        "26. Rh2": "Preserving the rook.\n",
        "26... Bxf5 27. Qh5": "This seemed best to maintain positional pressure. Rf1 is planned.\n",
        "27... Rfd8": "I do not like this move so much. Seems like ...Re8 is better.\n",
        "28. Rf1": "Asserting a pin on the queen. Black does have a refutation by means of a counter attack, but I like the manuever because it bring the rook into play on a half open near the king.\n",
        "28... Bg6": "! A nice move which is more than a simple threat. With this move black offers a queen trade, but the resulting outcome is an endgame pawn structure that favors black. It would still be a good fight after a trade, but it seems like black would have better chances than with the queens on the board.\n",
        "29. Qg4": "Declining the queens trade.\n",
        "29... Qe5": "^ ...Re8, --> Qxe2\n",
        "30. Rfh1": "^ Bxh6 gxh6 Rxh6 and threat of mate.\n",
        "30... Be4": "--> Bxh1\n",
        "31. Bf3": "Counters the threat BxR.\n",
        "31... Bxf3": "This move may not be so good for black because of the piece deficit. If the queens go off the board then white has the extra piece which may make the difference. The result is still somewhat uncertain, but this move seems to favor white.\n",
        "32. Qxf3 d5 33. Qg2": "Enables Bxh6\n",
        "33... Kf8": "Saving the h6 pawn.\n",
        "34. Re1": "!? Switching to a new line of attack, the rook seizes an open file.\n",
        "34... Qd6 35. Re3": "!? A rook lift. But why you may ask? The idea is Rg3 where it attacks g7 and prevents ...Qg6 in an attempt to trade queens. Now black will have to make a positional concession to save the pawn.\n",
        "35... Kg8": "? The computer senses the danger, but makes an incorrect move. The bishop is still watching h6 from behind the rook, and after the rook moves there will be increased threats.\n",
        "36. Rg3": "! Forces a positional concession.\n",
        "36... g5 37. Rxg5+": "!? Creating a nice attack, white gives back some material.\n",
        "37... hxg5 38. Bxg5": "A strong move which can not be refuted by (38...Qg6 because of 39.Bf6 Qxg2 40.Rh8#) or (38...Qg6 39.Bf6 Kf8 40. Rh8+ Qg8 41.Rxg8#), but can be avoided by ...Kf8\n",
        "38... Qxh2": "?? The computer makes a critical error and loses the game.\nAlternative variation: 38... Qg6 39. Bf6 Qxg2 (39... Kf8 40. Rh8+ Qg8 41. Rxg8#) 40. Rh8#\nAlternative variation: 38... Kf8 39. Rh8+ Kg7 40. Bf6+ Kxf6 41. Rh6+ Ke7 42. Rxd6 Rxd6\n",
        "39. Qxh2 Rde8": "No moves can save the game for black now.\n",
        "40. Bf6 Re1+ 41. Kd2 Rh1 42. Qxh1 Kf8 43. Qh8#": "Finally I get my revenge on the computer, after many games where it hacked me to pieces... ow. I have been playing the Bishop Opening exclusively against the computer because it provides for a difficult game where white really has to work hard to obtain a winning strategy. I have been theorizing some ideas for this opening, some gambit, some not. This opening plan seems good to me so far.\n"
