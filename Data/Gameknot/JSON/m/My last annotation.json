        "1. d4": "This was my first game in a tournament in which I played OTB some 4 months ago. My opponent was considered much stronger than I, as you can see from the ratings. Nevertheless, I felt confident that I could put up a good fight, since I was getting back in shape after a period of sloppy play and I always play well at that tournament (last year I had won the B-section, so I was allowed to participate in the A-section this year). My opponent started off with 1.d4. Earlier in my chess career I was unhappy with that, but now that I've discovered a nice opening against it, that's not the case anymore.",
        "1... Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5": "And there we are: the Benko Gambit. In the main line, which we will see in this game, Black gives up a pawn for nice open lines on the queenside and pressure on the weak White pawns. This game, at least the first part, will be instructive to see themes occurring often in the Benko Gambit.",
        "4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6": "White accepts the pawn sacrifice and is now two pawns up for the moment (though a6 will fall of course). As compensation, we can already see the open files Black gets.",
        "5... g6": "Because of a certain 'refutation', this is considered better than the immediate recapture. As said, a6 will fall anyway. The bishop belongs on g7 to put more pressure on the queenside.",
        "6. Nc3 Bxa6 7. e4": "One of the main lines, the other being 7.Nf3, with the idea of following up with g3, Bg2 and castling. In this line, White gets to 'castle by hand'.",
        "7... Bxf1 8. Kxf1 d6 9. g3": "This is the idea: the king will hide on g2, allowing the rook to enter the free (after the knight has developed).",
        "9... Bg7 10. Kg2 Nbd7": "Apparently 10...O-O is the normal move order, but I was not aware of that during the game (I still knew this line, but had apparently memorised the moves in the wrong order). However, I'm not sure if there's any difference actually.",
        "11. h3": "Not the normal move here. It prevents 11...Ng4 with the plan of hopping to e5 to have a nice outpost. The normal move here is 11.Nf3, after which 11...Ng4 is not very popular, but at move 12 (usually after 11...O-O) 12.h3 is one of the main moves. There are a lot of subtleties in the move order here, but I don't know them exactly. Any Benko expert care to help me out? At least in this game, it will all come down to a transposition. IN another game at this tournament against a 1800 player, the opponent played 11.Ne2. I got crushed in 30 moves in a near-perfect game by my opponent, I didn't even play badly there.",
        "11... O-O 12. Nf3 Qa5 13. Re1 Rfb8": "Both sides pursue their own goals: White is developing normally and preparing an e5 push, while Black is pressurising the queenside pawns with typical Benko development. The position here is a good example of the result of this opening and we're still well within opening theory.",
        "14. Qe2": "This is a rare move. The idea is probably to further support the centre in preparation for an e5 push and maybe also to defend the 2nd rank, b2 in particular. But as we'll see, that last goal is not really achieved...",
        "14... Ne8": "Opens up the diagonal for the dark-squared bishop. This is a typical Benko maneuvre: the knight is heading for b5, to exchange itself for the important defending knight on c3.",
        "15. Bg5": "White probably thought he was able to move the bishop now that the queen is protecting b2, but this allows a nice tactic. I thought for more than 20 minutes before making my next move...",
        "15... Rxb2": "! This wins back my gambit pawn. I hesitated because there was another way of winning back my pawn (taking twice on c3) and because I have to give up my strong bishop to regain the pawn, but I thought my activity would compensate for that. The computer agrees with my assessment and views this as the best move.",
        "16. Qxb2 Bxc3": "The point: I'm winning back the rook on a1.",
        "17. Qb7 Bxa1": "I didn't really have to take the rook immediately, but it doesn't matter much.",
        "18. Rxa1": "White could also have taken the knight on d7, after which I'll have to exchange my dark-squared bishop anyway (18...Bf6 19.Bxf6 exf6) because otherwise e7 is hanging.",
        "18... Qa7": "This was actually forced, all other moves lose material.",
        "19. Qb2": "White avoids the exchange of queens. Note that after 19.Qxa7 Rxa7, White can't take the pawn on e7, because after 20.Bxe7?? f6! the bishop is caught and can be taken by ...Kg8-f7xe7.",
        "19... Rb8 20. Qc3 Nef6": "The knight was not doing anything useful on e8 anymore, so it reactivates to f6. Black is now putting pressure on the White centre, in particular the pawn on e4, while he still keeps an eye on the queenside as well.",
        "21. Nd2 Rb4": "! Again very thematic. The rook is very active along the 4th rank and also attacks the pawn on e4.",
        "22. a3 Ra4": "I couldn't take on e4: 22...Nxe4?? 23.axb4! and I can take his queen, but he can take mine: 23...Nxc3 24.Rxa7 and I've lost a rook. I could also have played 22...Rd4 here, but I didn't like the fact that the rook would have no retreat along the same file and that it blocked the diagonal of the queen.",
        "23. f3": "Now that the rook is not under attack anymore, e4 has to be defended.",
        "23... Qa6": "Very subtle: the queen is threatening checks on e2 and/or coming to d3 (not right now, of course, but with the help of a knight).",
        "24. Kf2 Ne5": "I didn't mind if White would trade his bishop for my knight on f6, because it would strengthen the cover for my king and because my good knight would be left against his bad knight.",
        "25. Bh6": "!? Cutting off the g7 square from the king. I didn't really notice the merits of this move until after my next move...",
        "25... Qd3": "? Too enthusiastic. Better was to keep the queen on a6, so I can reply to 26.Rb1 by 26...Qa7. For example, I can play 25...e6. Another suggestion of the computer is 25...Kh8, which I don't really understand.",
        "26. Rb1": "! Whoops, didn't see that one. Now White surely gets the better of it.",
        "26... Nfd7": "?! Not best, but the computer's suggestion is.. uhm.. not very attractive either: 26...Kh8, to be able to block the check 27.Rb8+ with the poor horse (27...Ng8)... That would surely not be accepted by the animal cops!",
        "27. Qb2": "?! Fortunately for me, White misses a chance to win material by force. It's a long line though and I'm not sure how strong a player you have to be to spot this. Anyway, here we go: 27.Qxd3 Nxd3+ 28.Ke2 and if I play 28...N3e5? here, white can win material by playing 29.f4 Nc4 30.Nxc4 Rxc4 31.Rb7 and the knight can't go away due to the mate threat. So better is 28...c4, but then I lose that pawn after 29.Nxc4 Rxc4 30.Kxd3. White's move is very natural as well and is also good, but not as winning as the line suggested by Fritz.",
        "27... Qd4+": "! Black has to force the exchange of queens...",
        "28. Qxd4 Rxd4": "? ... but retakes with the wrong piece. 28...cxd4 is by far the better capture, though it weakens Black's pawn structure. This allows White once again to win material by force...",
        "29. Rb7": "Correct, attacking the knight which can't move.",
        "29... f6": "to be able to play ...Nf7 after White plays f4, to attack the bishop so if White takes my knight I can take his bishop. Still, there's a way for White to win material...",
        "30. Ra7": "?! ... which he misses. I think this was the most obvious chance for White: 30.Be3, evacuating the bishop with tempo, followed by 30...Ra4 31.f4 and Black loses a piece. As said, the immediate 30.f4? doesn't work due to 30...Nf7.",
        "30... c4": "?! Another tactical mistake, the position is too complex for both of us. 30...g5, to stop f4, was necessary.",
        "31. Be3": "?! But White misses his last chance. 31.Ke3 is still winning. By the way, there was no time trouble, White had more than 45 minutes left while I had some 18 minutes on my clock.",
        "31... Rd3 32. Ke2 c3": "! Correct. Now 33.f4 won't work anymore, since my pawn is too far advanced.",
        "33. Nb3 c2 34. Rxd7": "I had missed this one, but we now exchange into an ending with R+B vs. R+N and 5 pawns each. White is still slightly better, but no more than that. 34.Nc1 was the alternative, after which a forced simplification to a rook ending follows: 34...Rd1 35.f4 Nc4 36.Rxd7 Nxe3 37.Kxe3 Rxc1 38.Kd2 Ra1 39.Kxc2 Rxa3 and this seems drawish as well. I think I saw that whole line over the board as well, I remember seeing 38.Kd2 attacking rook and pawn, but knowing I could take his a3 pawn as well. I was actually a bit disappointed during the game that my passed c-pawn didn't bring me more than this, but analysing the game at home with my computer I found that there was nothing more to be gained from it: the pawn looked more menacing than it actually was.",
        "34... Rxb3": "Obviously not 34...Nxd7?? 35.Kxd3.",
        "35. Rc7 Rxa3 36. Rxc2 Ra8": "Here I was afraid that my opponent's rook would enter the last row, but I should have played more actively. Now White still gains a bit of an edge. This was also a decision which I had to make under time pressure, with about 10 minutes left on my clock.",
        "37. f4 Nd7 38. Rc7 Rd8": "This way I keep my material and it's hard to see how to progress for White here.",
        "39. Kf3 Kf7 40. h4 h6 41. Bd4 e5": "I was afraid White could make something happen on the long diagonal, so I decided on this pawn push which also activates my king should White take e.p.. It does weaken my d-pawn, but I thought I could easily solve that with a ...d5 move at some point.",
        "42. dxe6 e.p.+ Kxe6 43. Rc6": "Not the best try for an advantage I think, but it's hard to suggest an alternative move.",
        "43... Nb8": "The computer gives 43...h5 with a score of 0.00, but now White's rook has to retreat, or return back to c7, when I can repeat moves by 44...Nd7. Instead, my opponent offered me a draw (without making a move, but I didn't make a problem of that) and I was glad to accept it. Maybe he was tired since it was nearly 12 at night and he had travelled a long way to the playing venue that day, and wanted to go to bed before the next round would start, the next morning at 9. He said he thought he had a slight advantage but he couldn't work out how to make it count in time (he also had only 13 minutes left). Anyway, this was the highest rating against which I ever managed to get half a point in an OTB game (except for a simul in which I beat an IM, see another annotation of mine) and I was very pleased with that. In the tournament I eventually managed to score 2/6, with which I was quite happy given my rating, but I also had thrown away two games like a child (missing a simple 'attack the pinned piece' and a knight fork), but overall I was satisfied with my performance.\r\nI want to thank everybody for reading this annotation and my other annotations as well, and hopefully you have learned something from my insights. I want to say I learned a lot from you, as you can also see if you look at my rating curve on this site. Also, I hope I can stay in touch with a few of you. Thank you for everything, and farewell."
