        "1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 e6": "The Icelandic. White choosed the worst move, c4, the one the opening was intended against. ",
        "4. dxe6 Bxe6 5. f3": "Interesting, covering the knight's jumps. ",
        "5... Bb4": "? Here, theory recommends Qe2, even blocking the dsb, as a prelude to Bxc4. I'm not in a hurry, but this move is just a loss of time. ",
        "6. Qa4+": "Which white, wisely, takes advantage of. ",
        "6... Nc6 7. a3": "Now what?",
        "7... Bd6 8. b4": "Ok, it's now or never. If I just admit my mistake, I'll be crushed. I have to react. ",
        "8... Qe7 9. b5": "The temptation of such a good move is too big. But this gives me a not forced, but still overwhelming attack. ",
        "9... Bxc4+": "Delightful. This bishop will stay there for long. ",
        "10. Kf2": "Would be a good idea, but for...",

        "15. Kh4 Qf2+ 16. Kh3": "In this square I have no inmediate threat, but...",
        "16... h5": "I still have a tempo. White can do nothing. ",
        "17. bxc6 hxg4#": "A problem-like checkmate. Thank you for reading. "
