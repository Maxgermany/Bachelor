        "6... e5": "The Boleslavsky Variation of the Open Sicilian.",
        "7. Nf3": "This is the modern approach. Nb3 used to be played, but this move restricts the freeing d6-d5 by black, as there is pressure on e5.",
        "7... Be7": "h6 immediately is normally played.",
        "8. O-O": "He castles",
        "8... O-O": "Again, h6 is more common.",
        "9. Re1": "He is preparing more pressure down the e file, making d6-d5 harder for black.",
        "9... h6": "And I play this at last. ",
        "10. h3": "This is book too",
        "10... Be6": "Book move",
        "11. Bf1": "Ditto",
        "11... a6": "Slightly unusual, but common in most variations of the Open Sicilian.",
        "12. Nd5": "I was happy with this. Exchanging on d5 covers my weak d6 pawn with his d5 pawn. I don't mind giving White the two bishops, nor a bit more space.",
        "12... Bxd5": "So I take",
        "13. exd5": "He takes back.",
        "13... Nb8": "I go back.",
        "14. c4": "He protects c4.",
        "14... Nbd7": "I re-develop my knight.",
        "15. b3": "He re-enforces his pawns and prepares to develop his bishop to b2 or a3.",
        "15... Ne8": "This seems to be a new move in this position, Nh7 or a5 have been tried in the past. I am not sure that my move is any weaker than those moves.",
        "16. Bb2": "So he gets his bishop into place.",
        "16... Nc7": "Getting ready to expand with b7-b5",

        "17... f5": "I strike on the king side. Threat e5-e4",
        "18. Qe2": "Now if e5-e4, if I take his knight or bishop he can take my bishop on e7",
        "18... Rf7": "So I protect that bishop, making the same threat.",
        "19. Bc2": "Which he meets.",
        "19... b5": "This may be a mistake, trying for play on both sides of the board, but I couldn't really see what else to play.",
        "20. Nh2": "He prepares to undermine my centre.",
        "20... g6": "I prepare to meet that.",

        "22. gxf5": "He opens anyway.",
        "22... gxf5": "I take back.",
        "23. Kh1": "His king goes to a safer spot too, hoping for play with his rooks down the g file.",
        "23... Bg5": "So I move my bishop to a more attacking post.",
        "24. Reg1": "He continues with his plan.",
        "24... Qe7": "I get ready to mobilze Ra8",
        "25. Rad1": "He mobilizes his other rook.",

        "35. Nf2": "Another attack on e5",
        "35... Kh6": "To make sure he doesn't take with check.",
        "36. Re2": "I am not sure why he didn't just take on e5. He was afraid of pins on the e file, but are they really that dangerous. What do you think dear reader?",

        "42... Qf6": "Now if he exchanges queens, my king matches into the centre of the board and wins. ",
        "43. Qg2": "This is a massive mistake. Simply Kg2 and the position is still level",

        "44. Qg1": "He protects the knight",
        "44... Nd3": "Threat Nf7 check",
        "45. Bxd3": "He takes",
        "45... exd3": "I take",

        "48... Kh5": "No more checks!",
        "49. Qe7": "I was down to only two minutes now, and moving virtually instantaneously. This is the first win I missed. Queening the pawn with check looks so strong. In fact if I take the h pawn first, I am mating him.",

        "50. Kh2": "Now I have no more checks, and he is threatening mate on h7.",
        "50... Qc2": "So I cover that mate.",
