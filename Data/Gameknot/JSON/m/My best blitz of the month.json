        "5... Nc6 6. Be2": "defending Nf3, preserving lsb for after and preparing castle kind side ( better than a useless 6. Bb5 a6 7. Bb5xNc6 b7xc6 and even better than 6. Bd3 met by c4)",
        "6... Be7 7. O-O Qc7": "I did not understood the reason of this move, somebody does ? is not a blunder anyway but in my opinion it loose a tempo",
        "8. Ne5": "This is one of the interesting move in bird opening, if 8. ... Nc6 x Ne5 9. fxe5, which open the f colon in order threatening directly f7 with the rook. An dif not, the knight in e5 is a very good position",
        "8... O-O 9. Na3": "pretending go to b5 to attack the queen, but the goal was to move in c2 for bringing the knight to the kind side for after. So if opponent want to prevent B5, it will loose a tempo and let me preparing my troops movements",

        "12... Rfd8": "another move that i dont understand, this rrok was better in f8 defending F7. So now i have a plan : send lsb to h5 : If exchange with f6 knight, then my queen retake and win a good attack position (h5). If not, i can attack directly f7 which is threatened by e5 knight...",
        "13. Bh5 Nxh5 14. Qxh5": "so after exchange, we can appreciate a advantageous white position. Blacks has his queen side useless, with a lsb blocked and a queen far from battlefield. And i'm still threatening f7.",
        "14... Bf6": "now black queen is entering in the game protecting f7. Blacks has to defend. it is encouraging for me.",

        "22. Nd6 Rcg8": "anticipating Rf7 ?",
        "23. Rf7": "surely !",
