    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "So I start conventionally.",
        "1... Nf6": "He prevents 2. e4",
        "2. c4": "So I carry on with the most common reply.",
        "2... e5": "Dewi comes out with the Budapest Defense. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Gambit",
        "3. dxe5": "So I take.",
        "3... Ng4": "Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of the pieces, but it is virtually refuted by 4. a3! If white now tries to hang onto the pawn, he usually fails, or gets a compromised position.",
        "4. e4": "So I play this, opening up a discovered attack with my queen, on the Ng4. Now Nxe5 is met with 5. f4 and white has a space advantage.",
        "4... h5": "But Dewi plays another move. Already I am thinking for myself. After the game, it struck me that maybe white should just play 5. h3 here, and we reach the same position as after 4. e4 Nxe5 but with black having played h5 and white having played h3. I suspect that h3 is more use to white than h5 is to black, and white should have an advantage in that variation. Surprisingly I can't see this on either of the Gameknot opening databases.",
        "5. Be2": "But I played this, attacking the Ng4 again.",
        "5... Nc6": "But he just ignores it. If I now capture twice on g4, he has d6 uncovering an attack on my queen, followed by taking on e5. Black is a pawn down, but with some compensation, in the form to two bishops, better development and some open lines. So I chose another move.",
        "6. Nf3": "I put my faith in development again.",
        "6... Bb4+": "This pesky check helps his development. Now I thought that he was getting back his pawn, but I may be able to get the two bishops by blocking with my Nb1. I also considered by Bc1 to be my better bishop, worth hanging on to. ",
        "7. Nbd2": "So I blocked this way.",
        "7... Ncxe5": "He took.",
        "8. Nxe5": "I took.",
        "8... Nxe5": "He took back.",
        "9. O-O": "I castled, preparing f2-f4",
        "9... Qh4": "This surprised me. He is now threatening to exchange on d2 and then capture on e4.",
        "10. Qc2": "So I protect e4.",
        "10... Bd6": "This was another surprise. After the game we looked at lines like 11. c5\tNg4 12. Nf3\tBxh2+ 13. Kh1 Nxf2+ 14. Rxf2 Qxf2 15. Kxh2 and although black has a narrow material advantage - rook and two pawns for bishop and knight - black has lost all his attacking pieces except his queen, which can be harassed. The initiative has passed to white. Unfortunately instead I made a dreadful error.",
        "11. Re1": "Almost immediately after playing this, I realized it was a mistake. ",
        "11... Ng4": "Because of this move, with threats to f2 and h2.",
        "12. Bxg4": "So I remove his knight.",
        "12... Qxh2+": "He throws in a check.",
        "13. Kf1": "Forced!",
        "13... hxg4": "He takes back. He is now threatening Qh1+ followed by Qxg2. My next move prevents this, but 14. e4-e5 is objectively white's best, as Bc5 can be met with Ne4 protecting f2 and attacking Bc5.",
        "14. g3": "So now black is just a pawn up, although maybe it would be hard to make anything of it, as it is a doubled pawn.",
        "14... Bxg3": "This is the unsound bishop sacrifice.",
        "15. fxg3": "So I take.",
        "15... Qxg3": "He takes back.",
        "16. Ke2": "My king reaches relative safety on d1, and black hasn't quite got enough for a knight.",
        "16... Qh2+": "Dewi prepares to advance his main asset - his g pawn.",
        "17. Kd1": "My king reaches relative security on d1. He has 3 pawns for a knight, but I have an edge now. Round about here I turn down a draw.",
        "17... g3": "\"Passed pawns need to be pushed\"!",
        "18. Nf3": "But now my knight reaches a good square.",
        "18... Qh3": "He avoids the exchange of queens.",
        "19. Be3": "But now there is no way he is going to promote on g1, with 3 pieces - rook, knight and bishop - protecting it.",
        "19... g2": "But onwards the pawn marches - it may have been better to finish black's development and prepare to play 0-0-0. At last most of my pieces are working well together.",
        "20. Qf2": "Preparing to move my king to d2 or c2 to link my rooks.",
        "20... Qg4": "Dewi attacks e4.",
        "21. Bd4": "This move protects e4 with my rook, and also attacks g7",
        "21... Rh1": "His rook comes in.",
        "22. Kd2": "King moves.",
        "22... Rxe1": "He takes.",
        "23. Rxe1": "I take back. But this whole maneuver has exchanges his active rook on h8 for my inactive one on a1. Dewi would have been better advised to develop his queen side.",
        "23... d6": "Which he finally starts.",
        "24. Nh4": "I attack g2 again.",
        "24... Qg5+": "He throws in a check.",
        "25. Kc2": "King moves.",
        "25... Bh3": "Bishop comes out to add another protection to g2.",
        "26. Rg1": "But my rook attacks g2 again.",
        "26... Qg4": "So Dewi renews the attack on e4.",
        "27. Kd3": "I protect. His pawn on g2 is now a goner. ",
        "27... O-O-O": "He finally develops.",
        "28. Qf5+": "Rather than taking the pawn immediately, I consider it more important to take the queens off.",
        "28... Qxf5": "So Dewi takes.",
        "29. Nxf5": "I take back.",
        "29... g6": "He hits the knight.",
        "30. Ne3": "Again - the g2 pawn is going.",
        "30... f5": "He correctly tries to exchange pawns.",
        "31. exf5": "So I take.",
        "31... gxf5": "He takes back.",
        "32. Nxg2": "The g2 pawn finally falls.",
        "32... Bxg2": "I think this is a mistake - there is no need to make this exchange.",
        "33. Rxg2": "So I take back.",
        "33... Kd7": "He at last mobilizes his king.",
        "34. Rg6": "I prevent his king from advancing, and prepare to attack f5 from f6. This give Dewi the unpalatable option of losing his f pawn or allowing the exchange of rooks. He opts for the latter.  ",
        "34... Rf8": "So he prepares to advance the pawn.",
        "35. Rf6": "And I give him that choice.",
        "35... Rxf6": "And he exchanges.",
        "36. Bxf6": "And I take back!",
        "36... Ke6": "He advances his king.",
        "37. Bd4": "I retreat. I am not really threatening to take on a7 yet, but if he plays, say Kf7, then I can take on a7.",
        "37... c5": "He puts an end to the ideas of Bd4 taking on a7. He now wants to exchange another pawn with d6-d5. In those circumstances I have to be very careful. If he can exchanges my b pawn too, I could be left with wrong bishop and rook pawn, which can't be promoted. ",
        "38. Be3": "So now he can't play d6-d5 without losing his c pawn.",
        "38... b6": "So he protects c5 again.",
        "39. Bf4": "This also should prevent d6-d5.",
        "39... d5": "He plays this move too soon. Dewi should prepare it with, say a7-a6.",
        "40. Bb8": "Now he is losing at least another one pawn, and the position is lost.",
        "40... dxc4+": "So he takes with check.",
        "41. Kxc4": "I take back.",
        "41... Kd7": "His king comes across.",
        "42. Bxa7": "I take.",
        "42... Kc7": "He briefly traps my bishop, but my king is coming to its aid.",
        "43. Kb5": "With this move.",
        "43... f4": "This is too slow.",
        "44. Bxb6+": "And Dewi now resigned. Many thanks for reading. Please rate this on the star system, and leave a message or two. Until next time dear reader!"
