Bc2": "I chose the opening line to the Ruy Lopez because; 1) I always liked it, 2) I hoped to learn alot from this game knowing that it is also a favorite line of Dr. Euwe.  With his 10th move my opponent deviates from the theory which commands here 10 Nbd2.\r\n",
        "10... O-O 11. Qe2 Nc5": "Practically forced.  I rejected 11...Bf5 because of 12 Rd1 and I rejected 11...f5 because of 12 ef e.p. Rxf4  13 Ng5 or 13 Rd1 with advantage for White.",
        "12. Nd4 Qd7 13. b4 Nxd4 14. cxd4 Nb7 15. Qd3 g6 16. Bh6 Rfe8": "After 12 moves it will become apparent that 16...Rfc8 would have been better.  But this was not a combination, only a positional move.  Who can fortell the future for 12 moves ahead ?  \r\nCapablanca was once asked:  \"Senor Capablanca, how many moves do you figure ahead ?\"  Capa answered: \"One !\"    \"Only one ?\"    \"Yes,\" said Capablanca, \"the best one !\"",
        "17. Qd2": "Black was threatening Bxb4 and Bf5 - After 17 moves of a Ruy Lopez, Black has the initiative !   The center is locked, his King-side is secure, so Black will start action on the Queen-side.",
        "17... a5 18. bxa5 Nxa5 19. Nc3 Nc4": "If instead 19...Bb4 so White plays 20 Qf4 and Black lost a move.",
        "20. Qf4 Ra3 21. Bb3 Bf5 22. h3 b4 23. Ne2 Bd3 24. Rfe1 Na5 25. Nc1 Nxb3 26. Nxb3 Qf5": "White must now exchange Queens, otherwise he will be pushed back further and further.",
        "27. Qxf5 Bxf5 28. Rec1 Rea8": "If on his 16th move Black would have played his Rook to c8, he could now continue with 28...Bd8, then double his Rooks on the a-file.",
        "29. Rxc7 Bd8": "This looks pretty good but better was probably Bf8.",
        "30. Rcc1 Ra3xa2 31. Rxa2 Rxa2 32. g4 Be6": "Bitter necessity !  I had relied on 32...Bc2 ?  Black should have played 29...Bf8.",
        "33. Nc5 Ra8": "Undoubtedly the safest move here.  If 33...Bh4 so 34 Be3.  Risky for both sides would be 33...Bh4   34 Nxe6 Bf2+  35 Kf1 fe  36 Rc8+ Kf7  37 Rf8+ Ke7  38 Rxf2 b3  39 Bf8+ Kd7  40 Ba3 Rxa3  41 Rb2 Ra1+  42 Ke2 Ra2  43 Rd2 b2 and Black wins.  Or instead of 39 Bf8 White plays 39 Bc1 Ra1  40 Ke2 Rxc1  41 Kd3 Rh1  42 Kc3 Rxh3+  43 Kb2 Rg3 better for Black.",
        "34. Rb1 Ba5": "Not 34...Rb8?  35 Na6 !",
        "35. Ra1": "Better would have been 35 Nb7.",
        "35... Ra7 36. Nb3 Bb6 37. Rxa7 Bxa7 38. Bd2 h5 39. f3 hxg4 40. hxg4 Bd7 41. Bxb4 Kg7": "White is a pawn up but Black has confidence in the Bishop pair and plays for a draw.",
        "42. Bc5 Ba4 43. Na5 Bb8 44. Bb6 f6 45. f4 g5 46. exf6+ Kxf6 47. Bd8+ Kg6 48. f5+": "Alternatives are here 48 fg Bf4  or  48 Bxg5 Ba7 each time with an easy draw.",
        "48... Kh6 49. Kg2 Bd1 50. Kh3": "Absolutely necessary was here 50 Nc6 Bf4  51 Ne5 Bxe5  52 de Bxg4 draw.",
        "50... Be2": "Now for White the only move would have been to give up the g-pawn and play 51 Kg2.  Most likely a  draw would result, although Black might have slight winning chances in this variation.  However it was 2 AM and Dr. Euwe was probably very tired from the stubborn resistance.  He overlooked what Black was threatening and played 57 Nc6 ?? after which Black played 51...Bf1 mate.",
        "51. Nc6 Bf1#": "Dr Euwe's exhibition at the Manhattan Chess Club had the following surprising result:  Dr. Euwe +3 -6 =6.  As we can see out of 15 games the world champion was able to win three !\r\n\r\nVisit http://www.ConnecticutChess.com for more chess games by Dr. Joseph Platz and others.\r\n"
