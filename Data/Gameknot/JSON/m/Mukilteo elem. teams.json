        "1. e3 e6 2. d4 c5 3. Nf3 Nc6": "A strange opening, but it seems to work.",
        "4. Bd2 Nf6 5. c4 d5 6. Qa4 Bd7 7. b3": "A mistake; there is no retreat for the white queen.",
        "7... cxd4": "Definitely should have played Nxd4 instead. (Queen trap!)",
        "8. b4": "Stephen, now noticing that his queen is in peril, urges his team to give her an escape square.",
        "8... Nxb4 9. Qb3 Nc6 10. Qxb7": "A blunder? I think yes.",
        "10... Rb8 11. Qa6 Rb6": "The queen gets pushed around while my rook develops.",
        "12. Qa4 Bc5 13. exd4 Nxd4": "Right now my pieces slowly creep over to attack the white king.",
        "14. Qd1 Ne4": "If I took the f3 knight right away, then if gxf3 my knight could no longer come to e4.",
        "15. Ba5": "A bold move; I did not even realize this threat. But I have something better...",
        "15... Rxb1": "I told my team: Although this move is risky--and I showed them the variations--often times you have to be risky in chess. I believe we made the best decision.",
        "16. Rxb1": "This is Stephen's team's best move, since Qxb1 is met with Qxa5+, Kd1, Nc3+, forking the king and queen; Bxd8 is met with, Bb4+, Nd2(forced), Bxd2#",
        "16... Qxa5+ 17. Nd2 Bb4 18. Qc1": "A blunder indeed. All it did was waste a move and make way for mate. Probably best for white is Rb2.",
        "18... Bxd2+ 19. Kd1 Ba4+ 20. Rb3 Bxb3+ 21. axb3 Bxc1 22. Kxc1": "Stephen later asked: \"What if I didn't take the bishop?\" Answer: Mate would still be forced (Qd2#) or if b4 then King move and mate on the next turn (Qc2# or Bd2#).",
        "22... Qa1#": "We finished just in time to leave, luckily. I hope you enjoyed our game."
