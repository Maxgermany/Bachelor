        "3. d4": "I contemplated En Passant here, but didn't want to open the board an leave my opponent with a strong position.",
        "3... d5 4. c5 c6": "I like the symmetry",
        "5. Be2 Nf6 6. Qa4 Bd7 7. Qb3": "Should have caught this, but here is where I make a blunder and get behind early.",
        "7... Be7 8. Qxb7 Na6": "I make the choice to sacrifice my knight and save my rook, even though it leaves me vulnerable",
        "9. Qxa6 Bc8": "I probably should have moved my queen to C8, but this is only my second mistake, haha",
        "10. Qxc6+ Bd7 11. Qa6 Bc8": "Nothing to lose this time by trying it again...",
        "12. Bb5+ Nd7 13. Qc6 Rb8 14. Nc3": "My opponent was going to get a pawn regardless, and I didn't like his position, so I chose to made another sacrifice, which ended up helping open the board back up for me and give me some wiggle room.",
        "14... a6 15. Bxa6 Bxa6 16. Qxa6 O-O": "My pawn is still vulnerable, but I can make an even trade of pawn, pawn, knight, knight.  Which, I decided to do.",

        "23. Kf2 Bd2": "I wanted my opponent to trade with this move, but it obviously would have left them in a tight spot.",
        "24. Rd1 fxg2": "This pawn is tearing it up.  My opponent can now trade my pawn for his rook, or we can trade bishop, and knight and leave my pawn sitting there on the goal line.\r\n\r\nI love how his queen has been sitting over there doing nothing while all this transpires.",
        "25. Rxd2 Qxh3 26. Qa5": "My opponent was finally able to move his queen.  At first I thought that this was an aggressive move that would force me into checkmate if I didn't trade rooks.  But after consideration, this was a passive move, and let me finish off his pawn.",
        "26... Qxh2": "My opponent must get out of the way, or I am going to promote my pawn while putting him in check.  There is only one place to go without checkmate upon promotion...",
        "27. Kf3 Rxd2": "I could have promoted my pawn here, and traded my queen for his rook.  This may have been the better move, but I wanted to get both of his rooks out of the way.",
        "28. Bxd2 g1=Q 29. Rxg1 Qxg1": "I have now recovered from my early blunders to take the lead, although my opponent is in a good position to promote his pawn unless I can do something to stop it.",
        "30. c7 Qf1+": "So the dance begins to keep his pawn from promoting",
        "31. Ke4 Qc4+ 32. Kf3 Rc8": "Blocked successfully, but I am worried about my king trapped behind the castle wall",
        "33. e4": "I contemplate making an escape route for my king here, but decide to take advantage of my queens position to eliminate the his goal line pawn.",
        "33... Rxc7 34. b3": "I am forced to move my queen, so I know that I must keep my opponent in check with my queen until I can move my rook out, all the while avoiding the easy checkmate of my king trapped behind the castle wall.\r\n\r\nI thought that this was a really good move by my opponent.  I wasn't expecting it.",
        "34... Qf1+ 35. Ke3 Qh3+ 36. Kd4": "I was worried my opponent would have moved his king the other direction, but he helped me out.",
