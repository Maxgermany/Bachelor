        "6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. c3": "a good alternative is 9.Qe2 with the idea of Re1 with More  pressure on the center .",
        "9... Bc5": "developing the black DSB on c5 instead of e7 shows aggressive game for the black  .",
        "10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Bc2 Nxf2": "interesting move , Botvinik shows some courage with this exchange , however this move going to lead a very complicated game in the following of the game .",
        "12. Rxf2 f6": "good move , the idea of 12.f6! is to open F file for the black Rook and bring more Pisces on the future thrugh this file .",
        "13. exf6 Qxf6 14. Qf1": "good move , Smyslov feels that something wrong going to happand on the king side , so the idea of 14.Qd1!is to help with the defense ,and the white knight on d2 stays on his position to help the other knight on f3.",
        "14... Bg4 15. Kh1": "i think 15. Qd3 was better move because of a fork on d5 and h7 pawns which black will have to move 15...Qf5 and after the queens exchange , the endgame will be better for white .",

        "18... Nd3": "18...h5 was much better move , if white plays 19.h4 this will make the blacks LSB more aggressive on g4.",
        "19. h3": "by this move , white wishes to open an escape sqaure for the white king .",
        "19... Bh5 20. Bc2 Nf4 21. Ng1": "good move . 21.Ng1!avoids the penetration of the black Rook to e2 and opens for white options of developments for his other Pisces by Ndf3 and Bd2 for example .",
        "21... c5 22. Ndf3 Ne2 23. Nxe2 Rxe2 24. Bd1": "a natural move like 24.Bd3?! allowed black to continue very strong attack by : 24...Bxf3.25.gxf3-Re1+.26.Qxe1-Qxf3+.27.Kh2-Qxd3. now if 24.Bd1-Bxf3.25.gxf3-Re6.26.Bd2 with the idea of f4 and brig the white  rook to the king side.",
        "24... Re6 25. Bd2 h6 26. Kh2 Re4": "it was better for black to retreat with the Bishop to g6 and avoid the exchange on h5 26.Ng5!-hxg5.27.Bxh5 and white now in better position .",
        "27. Ng5 hxg5 28. Bxh5 Re5 29. Bf3 Qe7 30. a4": "good move. after stableing the situation on the king side , white wishes to activete his rook on the queen side, its not a good idea for black play 30...b4 because of 31.cxb4-cxb4.32.Bxb4!",
        "30... Kh7 31. axb5 axb5 32. Ra7": "good move if 32...Qxa7.33.Qxe5 and the black pawns will fall one by one.",
