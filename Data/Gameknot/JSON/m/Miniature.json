        "5. e4": "If I can play it, I will. I overlooked Qb6 from black, which would have lead to the famous \"poisoned pawn (b2) situation\". ",

        "6... h6": "? Prevents the N's jump, but is a defensive move, hindering developement. My pieces are all out. Black already suffers a bad position. e5 seems to be his passport to freedom, trying to stand for the pawn with Bd6... ",
