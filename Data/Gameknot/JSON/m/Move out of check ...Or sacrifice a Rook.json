        "1. e4": "This was one of my tournament games.  I am annotating this game not because of the outcome, but because my opponent made a choice that surprised me, and I wanted to explain why sacrificing a full Rook was his best move rather than moving out of check.  I was really HOPING he'd just move out of check!  Read on, and enjoy!",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "I opened the game with my favorite Ruy Lopez opening...",
        "3... d6": "I was expecting 3...a6 to drive off my Bishop, but moving to d6 gave me the opportunity to double up his pawns on the c file...",
        "4. Bxc6+ bxc6": "....so I forced the exchange.  My experience has been that a weak pawn chain in the end game can often be the difference in winning and losing in a close game.  It's a good idea to look for these opportunities and take them whenever you can.",
        "5. d4": "Controlling the center in the middle game is important, so I continue to attack the four central squares with 5. d4.  Should Black choose to exchange pawns with 5... exd4, this would leave him way behind on development, and White still in full control of the center.",
        "5... Bd7": "Black shores up the weakness of his doubled up pawns, using his Bishop to protect the now vulnerable pawn he was forced to place at c6.",
        "6. O-O": "Always try to castle early to remove your King from danger...",
        "6... Be7": "By failing to protect the pawn again at e6, I move forward with the exchange...",
        "7. dxe5": "... hoping to gain a pawn.  If he chooses to retake the pawn with 7... dxe5, Nxe5 puts White a pawn ahead.  However, Black has a trick or two up his sleeve...",
        "7... Bg4": "Using his Bishop, Black effectively pins White's Knight at f3; if he moves it, Black will take White's Queen!  So now, I must REMOVE the pin.  Since my Bishop's gone, all I can do is move my Queen, or...",
        "8. h3": "respectfully request that Black move his Bishop...so I push the pawn to encourage a little Bishop activity.  Black obliges, not by moving away, but rather by...",
        "8... Bxf3": "taking the Knight.  This forceful move I was prepared for. So, remembering to maintain my pawn chain on the right side of the board, I...",
        "9. Qxf3": "...recapture with my Queen.  This allows Black to carry through with his plan of removing the Knight protecting the pawn at e5, so he...",
        "9... dxe5": "evens things back up by taking my pawn.  Unfortunately for Black, this opens up the d file, allowing me to attack his Queen with...",
        "10. Rd1": "Rd1.  Black can either move his Queen or block it, so he blocks it with...",
        "10... Bd6": "Bd6.  This gives me a chance to develop another piece, so I choose...",
        "11. Nd2": "Nd2.  But wait a minute!  Doesn't that block my Rook pinning the Bishop?  Wouldn't the Knight have better control of the center had I moved it to Nc3 instead?  Perhaps it would have, but I am planning Nc4, attacking the Bishop with not only the Rook, but also with my Knight.  ",
        "11... Ne7": "Black develops a piece and prepares for castling Kingside.  Why didn't he move Nf6 instead?  I don't know, but this allows me to proceed with my plan... I move...",
        "12. Nc4": "Nc4, attacking the Bishop.  Note also that Black has no pawn on the b or d file to remove the offending White Knight from it's post at c4. \r\n\r\nBlack may not have realized how vulnerable his Bishop was at d6; perhaps he's worrying more about his King's safety.  Whatever the reason, Black castles Kingside...",
        "12... O-O": "This leaves me with several options.  If I choose to take the Bishop now, Black can recapture with his pawn at c7.  This would allow him to regain good pawn structure, and better control of the center.\r\n\r\nBut wait!  Isn't Black's Bishop still pinned to his Queen?  Sure it is... I take full advantage of the situation by moving...",
        "13. Nxe5": "Nxe5, obtaining a FREE PAWN!  Note that Black's Bishop is powerless to recapture, because White's Rook at d1 will surely take his Queen if he does.\r\n\r\nAlmost instinctively, Black repels the invader with...",
        "13... f6": "f6.  He may not realize that this opens a white diagonal to his King.  This will become important a little later on.\r\n\r\nI've gotten what I wanted... a +1 material advantage, so I willingly repost the Knight (one of my friends used to call this \"Snuffy Smith\" chess.  The comic strip character was perpetually raiding his neighbor's chicken coop, but he never took more than he needed for supper!)",
        "14. Nc4": "REposting the Knight...",
        "14... c5": "Perhaps Black moved this pawn forward to allow him to move his Knight to c6, but I continue to attack his Bishop with...",
        "15. Bf4": "Bf4.  Note that I now have Bishop, Knight, and Rook focused sharply on Black's pinned Bishop.  Black counters with...",
        "15... Ng6": "Ng6, attacking the White Bishop at f4.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he's a bit late, so I go ahead with the exchange:",
        "16. Bxd6 cxd6": "I now have a choice of taking the pawn with either Knight or Rook.  Rxd6 looks good because it threatens Black Queen.\r\n\r\nHowever, I choose to take it with my Knight, because I *like* my Knights, as others may tell you...",
        "17. Nxd6": "Black sees that all I have to do is move my Knight, unleashing a discovered attack on his Queen with my Rook at d1, so he moves his Queen to...",
        "17... Qb6": "b6, attacking my pawn at b3.\r\n\r\nSure, I can defend the pawn MANY different ways: \r\n1. Nc4 attacks Black's Queen and defends the pawn,\r\n2. advancing the pawn to b3, preparing a solid pawn chain followed by c4,\r\n3. the passive Ra1b1...\r\nor even Qb3+, forcing a Queen exchange leaving White up two pawns ( I thought about this, but knew it would break up MY pawn chain and decided against it).\r\n\r\nSometimes, we miss truly great moves because we go on the defensive a bit too quickly.  I'm 2 pawns up, so WHAT IF Black takes the pawn at b2?  I'll still be a pawn up, and if he does take the time to gobble up the pawn, what can I do with my Queen in TWO moves?...  Let's see...",
        "18. Qf5": "My plans are to move my Queen to the white diagonal at either d5 or e6 and put his King in check, unleashing a Queen and Knight attack you may have never seen before...\r\n\r\n...but Black says,  \"Hey, he can't defend both the pawn and Knight, so I'll double attack his Knight with my Rook:",
        "18... Rad8": "Let's talk a moment about POWERFUL moves...\r\n\r\nIn progessing order:\r\n\r\nIf opponent attacks a pawn, you attack his Bishop or Knight...\r\nIf he attacks your minor piece, threaten to take his Rook or Queen...\r\nIf he double attacks your piece, or threatens your Queen, DON'T move defensively (unless you are forced to do so)... ",
        "19. Qd5+": "PUT HIM IN CHECK.  \r\n\r\nCheck is one of the most powerful moves you can make against your opponent - it CANNOT be ignored!  A response is ABSOLUTELY necessary.  \r\n\r\nThere's three ways to get out of check:\r\n1. Capture the attacking piece\r\n2. Move out of check\r\n3. Block it with one of your pieces.\r\n\r\nNow, for the question that is the title of this annotation, should Black...\r\n1. Move out of check?\r\n \r\nOr sacrifice a Rook?\r\n\r\nWhat would you do?  Think on this long and hard... there's a great lesson to be learned here.\r\n\r\nIf he moves Rf7, White can capture the Rook with either his Knight or his Queen...but if White takes the Black Rook with his Knight, Black can take White's Queen with Rxd5.. so THAT's not going to happen; if he takes the Rook with his Queen, White's Knight is protecting the White Queen at f7, Black's King is in check, and BLACK IS DOWN A FULL ROOK.\r\n\r\nSo, obviously, that can't be be best move, RIGHT?  Let's see what Black decided to do:",
        "19... Rf7": "Rf7?  \r\n\r\nI was really HOPING he would move Kh1, and I would have an opportunity to use \r\nSMOTHERED MATE:\r\n\r\n19.        ...Kh8\r\n20. Nf7+    Kg7\r\n21. Nh6++ Kh8   (because  if 21.     ...Kf8, 22. Qf7#)\r\n22. Qg8+   Rxg8\r\n23. Nf7#\r\n\r\nThere are other endings, the least of which White would be up +4, and Black would be unable to prevent White queening a pawn.  Play through other options you have, and I welcome your comments.\r\n\r\nWhite continues here with...",
        "20. Qxf7+": "Qf7+!  White happily snaps up a full Rook for free and puts Black in check...",
        "20... Kh8": "No option here.  Black's King retreats to the only square available.",
        "21. Nc4": "Moving the Knight aside to bring up the reinforcements, White also attacks Black's Queen.  Black still has some fight in him, as he plays his own powerful move: ",
        "21... Rxd1+": "Rxd1+  See how I am powerless to take his Queen?  Of course, I counter with...",
        "22. Rxd1": "Rxd1...",
        "22... Qb8": "...giving Black the opportunity to move to the only square that he can prevent mate by Qe8+  Nf8 followed by Qxf8#\r\n\r\nI added an additional threat of mate at g7 by moving...",

        "24. Nd6": "Oops!  Did I make a mistake here?\r\n\r\nBlack certainly thinks so.  In moving my Knight to d6, I left myself open for one of my favorite attacks...",
        "24... Ne5": "... the Knight Fork!   OUCH!  How can I be so close and slip up like that!!!???\r\n\r\nRemember about POWERFUL moves.... when your opponent attacks your QUEEN...",
        "25. Qxg8+": "PUT HIM IN CHECK.\r\n\r\nEven after the exchange, I'll be WAY ahead...",
        "25... Kxg8": "Not only am I +7 ahead, but also I was able to break the Knight Fork, freeing up my Rook to take his pawn at a8..\r\n\r\nOR....\r\n",
        "26. Rd8#": "... to simply checkmate him on the 8th rank (with a little help from my Knight friend at d6!)\r\n\r\nI hope this was helpful and/or entertaining, and I welcome your comments and suggestions.
