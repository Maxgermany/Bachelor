        "5... d6": "This is better than ...a6; but even now the King's Bishop is shut in, and the Queen's Pawn rendered weak.",
        "6. Bf4": "Correctly played, compelling the advance of the e-Pawn, which leaves the Queen's Pawn weak and unsupported.",
        "6... e5 7. Be3 f5": "...a6 would have been sounder play, but even then the game would have been in favor of the first player.",

        "15. Qh5+ Kxf6 16. fxe3": " Ne8+, seemingly a good move, is only in appearance, as Black might have taken it when placed there; and on White taking Queen, have answered with ...Bb4+, obtaining a winning game.",
        "16... Nxc2+ 17. Ke2": "Black Resigns, A wonderful game Played by Morphy."
