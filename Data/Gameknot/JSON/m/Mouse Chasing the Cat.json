        "1. e4": "Team Match against the same player I just annotated \"The Fight is On\" against. This time I'm white and go with the open game.",
        "1... Nf6 2. e5": "Alekhine's defense. Alekhine is my favorite world champion. I've always liked reading about the guy. But I don't like his defense. It seems a bit weak, compared to other black choices. Too bad he didn't invent the Sicilian...",
        "2... Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3": "Standard developing stuff.",
        "4... Bg4 5. Be2 e6 6. O-O Be7 7. c4": "Time to get a bit aggressive, gaining ground in the center with a tempo.",
        "7... Nb6 8. Nc3": "I think 8. Nc3 is the prescribed move, but I am a little concerned about black playing Bxf3. White must either recapture with the g2 pawn, destroying the castle, or with the bishop on e2, forfeiting defense of the c4 pawn and losing it. However, at least for now, after 7. ... Bxf3 8. Bxf3 Nxc4? white has 9. Bxb7 winning back the pawn and about to win the exchange. White must be alert and watch out for black defending against this continuation.",
        "8... O-O 9. Be3 Nc6 10. exd6": "Like that right there. Black defended against the continuation so now black can do damage with Bxf3. So first, white makes an attack that black must deal with first.",
        "10... cxd6 11. d5": "And again.",
        "11... exd5 12. cxd5": "And now there is no pawn on c4 to worry about.",
        "12... Bxf3 13. Bxf3 Ne5 14. Be2": "Preserving the bishop pair.",
        "14... Nec4 15. Bd4": "Again.",
        "15... Bf6 16. Ne4": "The pawn on b2 seems en prise, but the white bishop on d4 is defending it now that white's knight moved to e4. If 16. ... Nxb2?, black immediately puts white's queen en prise, and white cannot just play 17. Bxb2? for then black plays 17. ... Bxb2 and gains a pawn. Instead, white plays a zwischenzug with 17. Nxf6+! gxf6 18. Bxb2 and white has gained a bishop for a pawn.",
        "16... Bxd4 17. Qxd4": "And now the queen takes up the defense of b2, and adds pressure against the knight on c4 which now must be protected further, or moved.",
        "17... Ne5 18. f4": "And now must be moved again.",
        "18... Ng6 19. f5": "And again.",
        "19... Ne7 20. f6": "And again. This is like the mouse chasing the cat, three consecutive moves by the same pawn driving away the same knight.",
        "20... Nexd5 21. fxg7": "20. ... Nexd5 was a very scary choice for black, but so was 20. ... gxf6. Either move leads to difficulties.",
        "21... Re8 22. Bh5": "The threat is obvious. ",
        "22... Re5 23. Bxf7+": "At this point white has his eyes on gaining a rook. The rook that is about to be pinned.",
        "23... Kxg7 24. Rf5": "Black walks into the pin, but that advanced white pawn was threatening all kinds of damage if it were allowed to promote.",
        "24... Qe7 25. Bxd5 Nxd5 26. Nxd6": "26. Nxd6! is the winning move here. Now the black rook must fall.",
        "26... Qxd6 27. Rxe5": "And fall it does, but now the black knight must also fall, or the black queen. White obviously threatens 28. Rxd5+. Black cannot save the knight with 27. ... Rd8?? for 28. Rxd5+ gives discovered check, winning the knight for free since black must deal with the check and cannot recapture. Further, all black moves allow white to capture the black queen next move. So the black queen must move somewhere, but almost all of her moves allow white to chase her with the rook, giving the discovered check and following with RxQ. Moving the black king, say with 27. ... Kf7, doesn't work after 28. Rf1+! K-moves 29. Rg5+ and now black must sacrifice his queen to prevent checkmate, losing both queen and knight for a rook. This is the point that black chose to resign."
