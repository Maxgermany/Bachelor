        "6... Ngf6 7. Re1+ Be7 8. Nc3 O-O": "but Black has equalised now since White's d-pawn is still at home.",
        "9. Bxd7 Bxd7 10. d3 Re8 11. Bg5 h6 12. Bxf6 Bxf6": "Now Black has the advantage of the Bishop Pair on a  relatively open board.  Can he use it?",

        "13... Bc6 14. Nxf6+": "? Better was 14. Rxe8  when 14... Qxe8 allows 15. Nxf6 , when Black has to retake with the g-pawn.  Otherwise 14. ...Bxe8 puts Black's bishop on a bad square and the good bishop falls with 15. Nxf6 ",
        "14... Qxf6 15. c3 Rad8 16. d4": "? Better was 16. Rxe8  (again), when Black can't divert White's attention from the d-file.  White also has to watch out for his N on f3.  He shouldn't allow Black to give him doubled f-pawns.",
