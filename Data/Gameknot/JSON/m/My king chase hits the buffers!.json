        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nHere is an unrated game as black against my buddy Michael which finished today.  Sadly I ended up copping Old Matey.  Before that, however, Glenda played a game of Chase Me Charlie with Michael's king who unfortunately found a safe niche in my position and I ran out of checks.  I lost the game due to failure to develop Fou Leblanc in a timely manner.  When Fou Leblanc eventually came out on MOVE THIRTY, he met an inglorious death to the white rook.  The end came 3 moves later.  Anyway, on with the show.  We have a double king pawn opening with e4 and e5.",
        "1... e5 2. f4": "2. f4 - and Michael gives me the King's Gambit which I accept.",
        "2... exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ne5": "5. Ne5 - this bold move to e5 by white's steed is called the Kiezeritzky Gambit.  The knight sometimes goes to g5 which is called the Allgaier Gambit in which a knight is sacrificed for a pawn on f7.  The black king must capture to avoid dropping a rook and he becomes mighty exposed, but this is the calmer, saner Kiezeritzky and I respond with a sane developing move such as Nf6.",
        "5... Nf6 6. Bc4 d5": "6. ........ d5 - opening a line for Fou Leblanc.  You would never believe that he stays at home until the game is 30 moves old but he does.",
        "7. exd5 Bd6 8. d4 O-O": "8. ....... 0-0 - Henry goes kingside but this is rather open.",
        "9. Bxf4 Nh5 10. g3 Nxf4 11. gxf4": "11. gxf4 - piece trade.",
        "11... Re8": "11. ....... Re8 - pin.",
        "12. Kf1 Qf6 13. Qd2 Bxe5": "13. ........ Bxe5 - after white quietly moves the Wicked Witch of the West out to d2 there is a series of trades.  First up, a piece trade.",
        "14. dxe5 Rxe5": "14. ....... Rxe5 - now a pawn trade.  The BR cannot be captured because the f4 pawn is pinned.",
        "15. Nc3 Nd7": "15. ....... Nd7 - development.",
        "16. Kg2 Qh6": "16. ........ Qh6 - Glenda eyes a chance to attack down the g or h file so she moves to h6 still keeping the f pawn in a pin, this time against the Witch.",
        "17. Rae1 Rxe1 18. Rxe1": "18. Rxe1 - rook trade.",
        "18... Nf6": "18. ....... Nf6 - clearing the way for Fou Leblanc but Michael has other ideas.",
        "19. d6": "19. d6! - good move, I do not want to lose a pawn so I take on d6.",
        "19... cxd6 20. Qxd6": "20. Qxd6 - nasty!",
        "20... Kg7 21. Re7 Qxh4": "21. .......... Qxh4 - this pawn turns out to be poisoned but although I did anticipate white's next moves I thought that I would be able to get a perpetual somehow.",
        "22. Rxf7+ Kg6 23. Ne4 Qh3+": "23. ........ Qh3+ - here is a series of checks where the WK is chased around the board.",
        "24. Kg1 Qe3+ 25. Kf1 Qh3+ 26. Ke1": "26. Ke1 - the WK moves towards the centre.",
        "26... Qh1+ 27. Kd2 Qg2+ 28. Kc3": "28. Kc3 - and towards the queenside.",
        "28... Qf3+ 29. Kb4 a5+": "29. ........ a5+ - a humble footman steps in to try and help Glenda but ......",
        "30. Kb5": "30. Kb5 - ....... The WK ensures I have only one check left, will it work?",
        "30... Bd7+ 31. Rxd7": "31. Rxd7 - Glenda took the knight on e4 but just as I was about to hit the submit button I noticed that white's lsb could pin her against Henry on d3.  So I hit reset and I decide on Ra6 to attack the witch and cover black's third rank.",
        "31... Ra6 32. Qe7 Nxd7": "32. ....... Nxd7 - I decide to take the rook as my knight is not pinned, however the rook is poisoned because next move I cop Old Matey with the Wicked Witch landing on g5.  Sigh and double sigh.  My only consolation was that the game was unrated.  Hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now.  Joanne",
