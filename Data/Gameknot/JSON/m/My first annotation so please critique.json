        "1. e4": "This game is one I played on a site similar to GameKnot.  It was in the second to last round of a tournament and I needed to win or draw in order to avoid elimination.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5": "The game solidifies into the Wing Attack, which slightly favors white if played accurately",
        "6. Bb3 Be7 7. Re1 O-O 8. h3": "Mostly waiting for black to commit while restricting black's potential for king side expansion",
        "8... Bb7 9. c3": "Giving the white bishop an escape route and preparing to strike at the center ",
        "9... d5": "Black strikes first!",
        "10. d4": "White goes ahead with his strike",
        "10... dxe4 11. Nxe5": "This instead of 11. dxe5 to hopefully win the over-extended pawn on e4",
        "11... Bd6 12. Nxc6 Bxc6 13. Bg5": "Pinning one of the defenders of that e4 pawn",
        "13... h6": "Forcing white to either retreat or exchange and leave black with the bishop pair.  I decided to exchange to avoid losing the initiative",
        "14. Bxf6 Qxf6 15. d5": "Forcing away the last defender of the e pawn.  In retrospect this move obstructs the white bishop and allows black's white bishop to remain active on d7 so all the focus on winning the e pawn was probably misplaced",
        "15... Bd7 16. Rxe4 Bc5": "Black has some serious attacking chances here, but I was pretty sure I could defend this position.",
        "17. Qe2 Rae8": "? I think Qg6 would have been better here as this allows white to bring its knight into the fight.\r\nI think the variation 17. ...Qg6 18. Qf3 Bf5 19. Re1 Rae8 is better",
        "18. Nd2 Qg6 19. Qf3 Rxe4": "?? Once again I think black would have been better served to force the issue with Bf5 as this allows the white knight to become even more active while gaining a tempo on the black bishop",
        "20. Nxe4 Bb6 21. Rd1 Re8 22. d6": "?? The knight on e4 is left to the mercy of black's rook",
        "22... c5": "?? Declining the knight?  Blocking the white bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal is not necessary as 22. ...Rxe4 23. Bxf7  Qxf7 Qxe4 leaves black with a winning advantage",
        "23. Bc2": "Defending the knight before it is too late",
        "23... Qe6": "Getting the queen away from the bishop's discovered attack.",
        "24. Qd3 c4": "This appears to be a good move as it opens up the black bishop with a tempo on the queen but...",
        "25. Nf6+": "! A devastating invasion by the knight.  Black resigned here."
