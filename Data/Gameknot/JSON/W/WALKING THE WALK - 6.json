        "1. Nf3": "Reti. I intend on the Fianchetto at this point, but what I like about f3 is there are so many options. I've learned this is probably not a good opening when I'm playing a more advanced player. ",
        "1... Nf6": "Book",
        "2. g3": "I have had some success against 1300-1400 level players when I Fianchetto and that is still my plan. I prefer flank attacks.",
        "2... d5 3. d4 e6 4. e3": "In hindsight, I think Bg2 may have been better here. I deviated from my initial plan. I'm now a move behind that plan. In addition, my DSB is not happy.",
        "4... Bd6 5. Bg2": "A little late. I wanted to castle first!",
        "5... O-O 6. O-O c5": "4. e3 is still not that useful. Seems like I wasted a move and I don't think black will forgive.",
        "7. Nc3": "Developing minor pieces. I would like to advance my knights quickly here since the center seems so complicated.",
        "7... Nc6 8. Nb5 Be7 9. Ne5 Nxe5 10. dxe5": "That's ugly. Two pieces unprotected. I think advancing the knight to b5 was premature. I considered Nd6, but that doesn't look very healthy.",
        "10... Nd7 11. e4": "Trying to free up my DSB, still paying for that e3 move. I thought black would trade pawns.",
        "11... d4": "Rut Roh, that can't be good.",
        "12. Nd6": "I reconsidered the knight move. I thought I might get a chance to protect the e5 pawn with my DSB. I should've moved f4.",
        "12... Nxe5": "So much for that plan.",
        "13. Nxc8": "I thought a bishop might be worth more than a knight. In hindsight, maybe the other bishop, but black's LSB is not really worth the trade.",
        "13... Rxc8 14. f4 Nc6 15. Bd2 c4 16. c3": "From here, I made so many errors (beyond what I've already made), I've also decided to stop annotating. Good game.",
