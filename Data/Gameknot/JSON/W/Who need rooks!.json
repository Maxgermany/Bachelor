        "1. d4 Nf6": "Here playing black on a challenge asked by Juanefe. Against d4, I play usually Nf6 giving me the oportunity to play the king indian defense, the queen indian, the nimzo or the benoni. I'm not a big fan of the queen gambit, I find these games quite boring most of the time. The dutch, mostly the leningrad variation, look pretty interesting but I'm not experienced enought with this opening to think about playing it in a ranked game. Maybe in a close future.",
        "2. Nf3": "Well, to tell the truth, this move surprised me very much. I didn't seen this move quite often and seriously didn't know what to play against it. Black still have a lot of choice and could transpose it to something lookliking at the QID, the KID or even the benoni. I think c4 is a little superior finally because it take the center right in the beginning, giving a lot of space to your pieces.",
        "2... c5": "I was thinking about to transpose into the benoni. With the knight on f3, white couldn't play the dangerous taimanov variation. This opening have his proper name, the Spielmann-Indian Defense. The name come from of Rudolf Spielmann, one of the best attacker in the first part of the last century.",
        "3. c3": "?! Black have good results generally with the Spielmann-Indian. I think the best way to fight it as white is to advance the pawn to d5, going into the main lines of the benoni. By doing so, white continue to keep his center pawn and take more space. The benoni is not considered as one of the best defense for black, but I really like this opening because some of my favorite players (Tal, Velimirovic) could do miracles with this. Anyway, it's rare that I enter into the main line of the benoni cause it's rare beginners know them (and I'm not going to help them to! :D). I don't like that much that c3 move because the knight will not be able to use it if black don't take the d4 pawn.",
        "3... e6": "Well, here black could have done b6 and going for a double flanchetto, giving a fine position later. However, this move sounded more natural to me.",
        "4. a3": "I think it's a lost of tempo at this point of the game, but it's still playable. White have now the option to do b4 to threat the c5 pawn.  I think Bg5 would have been better here.",
        "4... b6": "The fianchetto on the queen side is often used in the nimzo and the queen indian. With this kind of position, there's a lot of chance than white castle on the king side, so the bishop positionned on b7 can create some nice attacks.",
        "5. e3": "?! At this point in the game, I was thinking that this match would be at first a fight of space. I thought that it would be a hard fight in closed position a la Nimzowisht and I didn't wanted to be squizzed like a rat facing a snake. That's why I've been surprised by this move. White can now free his light squared bishop but it's gonna be harder for him to develop his queen side as we will see further in the game.",
        "5... a5": "?! Well I'm not sure if it was that much a good move. I think it was a kind of high risk high reward move. Losing tempo but taking space and countering white's development on the queen side. It can pay as it can be a problem later because there's possibility that white find a way to take benefit of the weakness on b6 (only the queen can protect it right now)",
        "6. Bb5 Be7": "We're now both ready to castle on the king side.",
        "7. Ne5": "?! White underestimated me here. With 5 pieces protecting the d7 pawn, there's no way white can dream of taking it, the only purpose of this move is to do Qf3 to threat my rook. On a bullet game or against a weak player it can be a strong move and give a won game early in the game but in this case it will only result as a lost of tempo. O-O would have been better here.",
        "7... Bb7 8. f3": "! Even if computer analysis doesn't like this move, I think it's a good move, useful later as much in offense than in defense.",
        "8... O-O 9. Nd2 Ne8": "! To me it was a great move, giving me the option to continue with f5 and even attacking on the queen side with Nc7. The computer analysis doesn't have the same opinion.\n\nComputer analysis:\nInaccuracy: +0.37 \u00bb \u2026 Ne8 10. O-O d6 11. Ng4 Nc7 12. Bd3 f5 13. Nf2 Nd7 14.

        "10... Nc7 11. Nxb6 Nxb5 12. Nxa8 Bxa8": "?? Well I think it really didn't worth it for white to lose a bishop and a knight for a rook and a pawn. It was too early in the game to make this kind of sac; white didn't have enought advantage to do this and it didn't provoked anything. White still lack of development, not coordinated for a great attack and his pawn structure is not that fine.",
        "13. Qd3 Nc7 14. e4 Nc6": "Thinking about to exchange as much pieces as possible to finish this off.",
        "15. Bf4 cxd4": "Exchanging the pawn to not have the burden to protect it later, giving the possibility to dismantle the 3 linked pawns. My plan here was: 16.cxd4 f5! 17.O-O fxe4 18.Qd2 Nxe5 19.Bxe5 exf3 20.gxf3.",
        "16. c4": "? White want to keep his 3 linked pawns but keep getting lower in materials. Black is better prepared than white right now to face this plan.",
        "16... Na6": "! I didn't liked the idea at this time that white exchange both his knight and bishop on my knights, moving my queen to c7. If my queen move, the white queen can get the d4 pawn. Nc5 will give me some counterplay later.",
