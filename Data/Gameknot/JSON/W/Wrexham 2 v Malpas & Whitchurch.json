    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "This was our last match of the season for Division 2 of the Chester & District Chess League. We needed at least a draw away to Wrexham 2 to become champions. They out-rated us on the top board, but we out-rated them on the bottom three boards.",
        "1... c5": "So it starts conventionally enough.",
        "2. Nc3 Nc6": "He indicates a preference for one of Closed Sicilians lines.",
        "3. g3 g6": "We both decide to fianchetto the King's Bishop. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto",
        "4. Bg2 Bg7": "We both play the logical follow-up move.",
        "5. d3": "This is now a Sicilian (B24), closed, Smyslov variation",
        "5... e6": "I prepare to develop Ng8 to e7.",
        "6. f4": "This looks aggressive. I was surprised to see after the game that this actually scores well for black on the Opening Databases.  ",
        "6... d6": "I wanted to rule out him playing e4-e5.",
        "7. Nf3": "The logical square for his King side knight.",
        "7... Nge7": "And I continue with my plan.",
        "8. O-O": "He castles.",
        "8... a6": "With both defensive and offensive objectives. I stop his Nc3 coming to b5, but also preparing b7-b5 in some lines.",
        "9. Be3": "With is bishop on this square I now begin to think in terms of playing d6-d5 and threaten d5-d4 forking his Be3 and Nc3. However an immediate d6-d5 is met by Be3xc5, so I have to prepare with b7-b6. An immediate 9....b7-b6 leaves me weak on the long white diagonal, for instance he can play 10. e4-e5 and if dxe4 he has 11. Nf3xe5 and my Nc6 is pinned along the diagonal. So I decide to move my rook off a8 first.",
        "9... Rb8 10. Qd2": "With the idea of f4-f5 and Bh6 at some stage.",
        "10... b6": "So I continue with my plan.",
        "11. Nh4": "and he continues with his plan to play f4-f5",
        "11... d5": "So I continue with my plan.",
        "12. exd5": "I think this is his best reply, as now if at some stage I continue with d5-d4 he will have e4 for his Nc3.",
        "12... exd5": "So I take back, still with the threat of d5-d4.",
        "13. Rae1": "And now the potential pin down the e file is dangerous.",
        "13... O-O": "So I castle, threatening d5-d4 again. He can play 14. f4-f5 here, as my fork d5-d4 is met by his fork 15. f5-f6, so computer thinks best for both sides is g6xf5 Bh6. It is all very complicated, but probably better than what he played, which is a little passive.",
        "14. Bf2": "Which was this. I rather liked my position now. f4-f5 has been prevented, most of my minor pieces seem to be on better squares than his, I just need to catch up with development.",
        "14... Nd4": "I liked this move, putting my knight on an attacking square. Computer liked d5-d4 and if 15. Ne4 then f5. However...",
        "15. Nd1": "He prepares to eject the knight with c2-c3",
        "15... Nef5": "So I bring up my other knight.",
        "16. Nxf5": "He takes.",
        "16... Nxf5": "I take back.",
        "17. c3": "He blunts my Bg7.",
        "17... Be6": "I develop my bishop.",
        "18. Ne3": "He exchanges my powerful knight on f5.",
        "18... Nxe3": "So I take.",
        "19. Bxe3": "He takes back.",
        "19... d4": "I hit his bishop.",
        "20. Bf2": "Which drops back.",
        "20... Bxa2": "If now 21. Ra1 dxc3 22. bxc3\tBc4 and black is consolidating his extra pawn. I was rather expecting 21. cxd4 Bxd4 22.\tRa1 Bxf2+ 23. Qxf2 Bd5 and although white is getting the pawn back, all the bishops are coming off. I may have a slight advantage in that his queen side pawns are very weak, but it would have been pretty level. Instead he takes another route...",
        "21. c4": "With a threat of 22. Ra1 and after Bb3, 23. Ra3 and my bishop goes. I had seen this too, but felt I would be OK.",
        "21... Bb3": "Hoping he would let me play Ba4.",
        "22. Rea1": "But of course he doesn't!",
        "22... a5": "I thought that this is the only way to meet the threat to my a pawn and to my bishop with Ra3. Instead b6-b5! would have given me an advantage. I should have been looking for ways to counter-attack rather than just defend.",
        "23. Ra3": "But he hits it anyway.",
        "23... a4": "I protect.",
        "24. Bc6": "This was the move I missed when I took on a2. He is getting his pawn back, but he is also exchanging his strong Bishop on g2.",
        "24... Qc7": "I offered a draw, which he declined.",
        "25. Bxa4": "He takes.",
        "25... Bxa4": "I take.",
        "26. Rxa4": "He takes back.",
        "26... Rfe8": "So I thought it was time to mobilise this rook. Computer still likes b6-b5.",
        "27. b4": "This is a good move from him, giving him queen side opportunities.",
        "27... Rba8": "Seeking rook exchanges.",
        "28. Qa2": "He backs up his rook.",
        "28... Qc6": "Protecting Ra8 and attacking Ra4",
        "29. Ra1": "He now trembles on the a file. Exchanges are best.",
        "29... Rxa4": "So I take.",
        "30. Qxa4": "He takes back.",
        "30... Qxa4": "I take again.",
        "31. Rxa4": "He takes back again.",
        "31... Bf6": "Played with the idea of protecting my queen side pawns with either Be7 or Bd8.",
        "32. Ra6": "He attacks b6. I probably should just play Bd8 as planned now, I think I was afraid of 33. bxc5\tbxc5 34. Rc6 but I have simply Be7",
        "32... Re6": "So I do this instead. ",
        "33. bxc5": "So he takes.",
        "33... bxc5": "I take back.",
        "34. Rxe6": "He takes.",
        "34... fxe6": "I take back. I should be able to draw this, although white has slight advantages, in the my queen side pawns are fixed on black squares, and my e pawn is isolated. However, at present it stops his king from reaching d5.",
        "35. g4": "This is a good move, giving his bishop more room, and gaining space on the king side.",
        "35... Be7": "I reposition my bishop to attack his pawn on f4.",
        "36. Kg2": "He moves his king up.",
        "36... Bd6": "I attack his pawn.",
        "37. Kf3": "He defends it.",
        "37... Kf7": "I move my king up.",
        "38. h3": "He gets his h pawn off the h2-b8 diagonal, where it may be vulnerable to my bishop on d6.",
        "38... h6": "I want to play Kf7-f6 and be able to meet Bh4+ with g6-g5.",
        "39. Ke4": "Centralising his king.",
        "39... Kf6": "I move my king up.",
        "40. Bg3": "Leaving me rather short of moves. Nicely played by him!",
        "40... Bc7": "So I retreat my bishop.",
        "41. Bh4+": "He throws in a check. Computer prefers 41. g5+",
        "41... g5": "Computer doesn't like this move and prefers Kf7.",
        "42. fxg5+": "He takes.",
        "42... hxg5": "I take back.",
        "43. Be1": "Now if only I could my bishop safely onto the h4-d8 diagonal and my king to a safe square, his h pawn would be permanently backwards. However I have not the space nor the time.",
        "43... Bd6": "So Play this.",
        "44. h4": "And he gets rid of his backward pawn.",
        "44... gxh4": "I take.",
        "45. Bxh4+": "He takes back.",
        "45... Kg6": "I move to stop his passed g pawn.",
        "46. Bd8": "Stopping my king from attacking his g pawn and maybe attacking my c5 pawn with Bb6.",
        "46... Kh6": "There is not much I can do. I am very passive.",
        "47. Bf6": "He has a plan...",
        "47... Kg6": "I hit the bishop.",
        "48. Be5": "He offers an exchange. I thought that if I accepted I was lost, but in fact I think I can draw in a similar way to the game Bxe5 49.\tKxe5\tKg5 50.\tKd6 Kxg4 51. Kxc5 e5 52. Kd5 Kf4 53. c5\te4 and draws. ",
        "48... Be7": "So I dropped my bishop back.",
        "49. Bf4": "He prepares to march his king in. Now I should have played Kf6, but instead....",
        "49... Bd8 50. Bd6": "Attacking c5",
        "50... Bb6": "Protecting c5",
        "51. Ke5": "Now passive defence loses, so I decided to counter-attack.",
        "51... Kg5": "Attacking g4",
        "52. Kxe6": "He takes.",
        "52... Kxg4": "I take.",

        "56... Kxd3": "I take.",
        "57. c5": "He advances.",
        "57... Ke2": "I prepare to advance my pawn.",
        "58. c6": "We both now advance and queen.",
        "58... d3 59. c7 d2 60. c8=Q d1=Q 61. Qg4+": "One last hope!",
        "61... Ke1": "No problem.",
        "62. Qxd1+": "Ending the game.",
        "62... Kxd1": "And of course, the position is now drawn. Many thanks for reading! Please rate my annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing!"
