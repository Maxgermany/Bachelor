        "12. c4": "...so I attack Knight!",
        "12... Nc7 13. dxc5 Nxc5": "Better move for Black might have been Qxc5...",
        "14. Be3": "...because taking the Pawn with his Knight allows me to pin his Knight to his Queen, AND he removes his Knight's protection of the e5 square (the jumping off point in preparation for a Knight fork at f7).",

        "19... Nd7": "Note that even though the Knight protects the jumping off point (e5) for the threatened Knight fork at f7...",
        "20. Ne5": "... it is pinned firmly to his King... almost as if it weren't there at all!",
        "20... Kc7": "Now I can still easily win the Rook... after Nf7, followed by Rg8, I can attack his Rook again with Bh7, leaving him nowhere to move his Rook.  Tempting as it may be, let's not forget that the object of the game...",
        "21. Qc2+": "... is to checkmate your opponent!  There is one for White, several moves ahead.  Can you see it?  If he moves his King back to d8, the Knight fork at f7 would certainly be my best option.  Better move his King to safety...",
        "21... Kb8": "Can you see a checkmate for White yet?",

        "25. Bxd6#": "... THREE - Checkmate.  Lessons to be learned here?  \r\n1.  Attacking moves greatly limit the possible responses of your opponent.\r\n2.  Look for sacrifices, and use them to your advantage.\r\n3.  The pin is mightier than the sword...\r\n4.  Winning material is very important, but checkmating your opponent is the ultimate goal in every chess game."
