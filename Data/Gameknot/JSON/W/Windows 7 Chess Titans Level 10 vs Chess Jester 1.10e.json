        "1. c4": "English (A34), symmetrical variation\n\nAnnotated by me and some help from Rybka.\nThe ratings are simply my estimates for both programs.",
        "1... c5 2. Nc3 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. e3": "This move gives room for the white bishop and also reinforces the center d4.",
        "4... Bxc3 5. dxc3 d6": "This move basically prevents white from taking advantage of the e5 square.",
        "6. Be2": "6. e4 Bg4 is slightly better.",
        "6... Nf6": "Even game thus far.",
        "7. O-O Nc6 8. b3 O-O 9. Bd2 Qa5 10. a3 Qb6 11. b4 Bf5 12. b5": "Seems like an okay move.\n12. Nh4 would threaten the black bishop (12. Nh4 Be6 13. f4 Ne4)",
        "12... Na5": "Na5 gives a small advantage to white.",
        "13. h4": "Alternate moves: 13. Bc1 Rfd8 14. Bb2 a6.",
        "13... Bg4": "13. ...Be6! attacks the c4 pawn.",
        "14. Bd3 Nd7 15. e4 Ne5": "Obvious threat here is Nxd3.",
        "16. Qe2": "A move like 16. Bg5 Rfe8 is alright.",
        "16... Nxd3": "Although this does not seem bad its not the best.\n16. ...Nb3 (bring that Knight more into play and attacks 3 pieces at once) 17. Rad1 Qa5 Bc1.",
        "17. Qxd3 Be6 18. Bh6": "Perhaps 18. Rfb1 is more interesting.",
        "18... Bxc4 19. Qb1": "19. Qe3 Bxc1 20. Bxf8 Rxf8 21. Rxf1 Qxb5 (gives black a significant advantage).",
        "19... Bxf1 20. Bxf8": "At least worth considering: 20. Qxf1 Rfc8.",
        "20... Bxg2 21. Kxg2 Rxf8 22. a4 c4 23. Kg1": "Waste of time.  23. Nd7 places the knight in a better spot.",
        "23... Qc5 24. Qb4": "Not a great move.  White should keep the queen while he can.\n24. Qf1 Qh5 25. Qh3 Nb3 is better but still opponent has advantage.",
        "24... Qh5": "Here the queens should have been exchanged.",
        "25. Ne1 Nb3 26. Ra2 Qg4+ 27. Ng2 Qxe4 28. Rb2 Nc5 29. Qa5": "Here white is thinking of perhaps pushing the pawn to b6.",
        "29... Ra8 30. b6 Nd3 31. Rc2": "I am confused why this move was made (other than to avoid the Knight).\nThe following looks much more interesting:\n31. Qxa7 Rxa7 32. bax7 Nxb2 33. a8Q+ Kg7 (still though black is winning). \n",
        "31... Qg4": "Certainly the reason for doing this move is okay.\n31. ...Ne5 is better though 32. Qxa7 Rxa7 33. bxa7.",
        "32. f3 Qxf3 33. Rd2 Nc1 34. Kh1 Nb3 35. Qg5 Nxd2 36. Qxd2 axb6 37. Qc2 Qg3 38. Qc1 Rxa4 39. Qe1 Qh3+ 40. Kg1 Ra2": "Black has basically won at this point.",
        "41. Qf2 Rxf2 42. Kxf2 Qxc3": "White resigns. (Rybka says: Mate in 12)."
