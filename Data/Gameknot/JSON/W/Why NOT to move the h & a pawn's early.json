        "3. Bc4": "Develops my LSB, and attacks the weak f7 square.",
        "3... Nd7": "...? Any idea's what the point of this move was?",
        "4. d4": "Center control!",
        "4... a6": "Black needs to develop! My white bishop is already on the a2-g8 squares, and has no ideas of moving to b5. I think Nf6 would be good here.",
        "5. Nc3": "Developing yet another piece. ",
        "5... h6": "Black is in desperate need for development. Again, I think Nf6 is best.",

        "7... Kxf7": "Obvious answer.",
        "8. Nxe5+": "Black can't take the knight with his own, because then I win his queen with ...Nxe5, Qxd8",
        "8... Ke8": "This is wrong, but I'm not really sure what to advise black to do at this point...",
        "9. Qh5+": "And now for the major point of this annotation! If black hadn't pressed his h pawn in the beginning and mearly developed,  he would have been able to press his g pawn, or defend in some other manner.",
        "9... Ke7": "Forced.",
        "10. Qf7+": "The black king is in peril!",
        "10... Kd6": "Again, forced.",
        "11. Nc4+": "Black resigns here, which is understandable. I hope this annotation has showed the importance of not pressing the h and a pawns in the opening!"
