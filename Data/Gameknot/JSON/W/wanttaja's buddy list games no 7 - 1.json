        "1. d4": "This game deals with the exchange sacrifice - one of the most difficult and challenging aspects of modern chess. Most commonly it involves an exchange of a Rook for a Bishop or a Knight - either for a direct attack or for positional reasons.",
        "1... Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6": "The Kings Indian is still one of the best choices for Black, if he wants a dynamic game with good attacking possibilities on the King-side.",
        "5. h3": "A very rare line indeed! The move is more flexible than it looks. First of all, it takes away a lot of squares from Black\u00b4s c8-Bishop. In case of a White Bishop-move to e3, it can\u00b4t be attacked by a Black Knight-move to g4 - and if White should decide to castle long, he has the move g4 in hand with an attack on the Black King.",
        "5... O-O 6. Nf3 a6": "I don\u00b4t think this is Black\u00b4s best option. Attacking the centre with Pawn-moves like c5 or e5 seems more active.",
        "7. Be3 Re8 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. a3": "A bit of a \"luxury\"-move, but Nb4 by Black could be annoying.",
        "9... e5 10. d5 Ne7 11. Qd2 c5": "Closing the centre, but also creating long-term problems when it comes to activating the Bishop on g7. White\u00b4s Bishop on d3 is not much worth either at the moment, but it gets new life when play moves to one of the flanks.",
        "12. O-O Bd7 13. b4 b6 14. Rab1 Qc8 15. bxc5 bxc5 16. Rb6": "This leads to the exchange sacrifice, and I must admit, that I had no idea if it would do the trick or not. Many of these sac.\u00b4s are played more by \"gut feeling\" than long calculations.",
        "16... Qc7 17. Rfb1 Bb5": "A very nice move, challenging the sacrifice.",
        "18. Rxd6 Qxd6 19. cxb5 Nd7": "!? After 19. - axb5 20. Nxb5, White has plenty of play against the Pawns on c5 and e5 plus a potentially dangerous passed Pawn on d5. My feeling was that White had more than sufficient compensation for the exchange, but absolutely nothing is clear yet!",
        "20. bxa6 Reb8 21. Rb7 Rxb7 22. axb7": "The Pawn on b7 will tie down Black\u00b4s pieces for a while and give time for re-grouping. Now 22. - Rxa3 could be answered by 23. Qb2 with a double-threat of Nb5 or promoting the Pawn.",
        "22... Rb8 23. Qb2 f5": "Black desperately needs to find some counterplay, or White\u00b4s two Queenside Pawns will decide the game.",
        "24. Qb3 Kh8 25. Ng5": "Threats the nasty fork 26. Nf7 ",
        "25... Qb6 26. Qxb6 Nxb6 27. Ba6 Nd7 28. Ne6": "Even with the Queens off, Black is still under a lot of pressure, and his pieces are not well co-ordinated. Now another Pawn has to go.",
        "28... f4 29. Bxc5 Bf6 30. Bd6 Rg8": "In this kind of position it becomes clear why a Rook can be a terrible defender.",
        "31. Na4 g5 32. Nac5": "White takes final control over the promotion-square b8, which will cost Black at least a piece. Therefore Black chose to resign. I hope this game will inspire you to look more for the option of the exchange sacrifice. If it works, it is a great weapon!"
