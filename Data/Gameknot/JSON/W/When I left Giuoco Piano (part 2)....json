        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4": "introducing the Italian Party, with an early attack on f7... usually follows Bc5, c3 (preparing d4), Nf6; after Ng5, 0-0, so White usually continues with d4...",
        "3... Nf6": "the Two Knights' Defense...",
        "4. Ng5": "the sharpest reply...",
        "4... d5 5. exd5 Na5": "another option is Nxd5, Nxf7!? (although d4! is much stronger), Kxf7, Qf3+, usually leading to very sharp play from both sides...",
        "6. Bb5+ c6 7. dxc6 bxc6 8. Qf3": "the Blackburne Variation: the simple clue here is cxb6?, Qxa8... best reply here is probably Rb8, forcing Bd3 or even Be2; this last move - originally from Steinitz, followed by Nh3!? - was brought into tournament practice again by Kasparov... Black can also play directly Qd5, Be2 (Bd3, Qxf3, gxf3, Nd5!), e4, Qg3, h6, Nh3, g5...",
        "8... Be7": "not too accurate: this will at least cost a pawn; against this opponent, I considered this no small feat...",
        "9. Bxc6+ Nxc6 10. Qxc6+ Bd7 11. Qc4": "the other option was Qf3, Rc8, Nc3, Bc6, Qg3, Nh5, Qxe5, f6, Qe2... not very cosy for the Queen...",
        "11... O-O 12. Nc3 Rc8 13. Qe2 h6 14. Nge4": "better than Nf3, e4, Nxe4, Nxe4, Qxe4, Bb5...",
        "14... Nxe4 15. Qxe4 Bc6 16. Qe2": "played in error: I was considering Qf5, Bxg2, Rg1, but could find nothing after Bb7... best here is Qe3, Bc5/Bg5, Qh3...",
        "16... Bxg2 17. Rg1 Bb7 18. d3 Qb6 19. Bd2": "although still a pawn ahead, White is getting in trouble...",
        "19... Bh4": "I was calculating on Qf6, Qh5, Kh8, Rg3, Bc5, 0-0-0, Bd4... this move was stronger, than I suspected...",
        "20. Qe3 Qf6": "donating another pawn; I was in no position to argue...",
        "21. Qxa7 Bf3": "after Rfe8, Qe3; this prohibits long castling...",
        "22. Qe3 Kh8": "no use is Bg5, Rxg5, hxg5, Qxg5, Qb6, Qf5, e4, Nd5...",
        "23. a4": "bringing another pawn in the mixture...",
        "23... Rc6": "according to GK analysis, this is a mistake; I am not so sure... this pawn will not make the difference...",
        "24. a5 Rb8 25. a6 Rxb2 26. a7 Rc8": "the only one...",
        "27. Ne4": "the only way to disarm Bf3, in order to reach a8...",
        "27... Bxe4 28. dxe4 Qc6": "most certainly not the best move; that would be Ra8... but White has to react; it is too soon for Rg4...",
        "29. Qd3": "after Rg4, Bf6...",
        "29... Ra8 30. Rg4": "I saw nothing after Qd5, Qc8; this holds more initiative...",
        "30... Be7": "Bf6 is somewhat better; no good is Bg5, Bxg5, hxg5, Kf1, Rxc2, Rg3, Qc8, Qd5... somehow, Black can afford not playing the best moves...",
        "31. Qd5 Rxc2": "again, not the best; Qc8, Rg3 holds more initiative...",
        "32. Qxc6 Rxc6 33. Be3 Bc5 34. Rg3 Bxe3 35. Rxe3 Rc7 36. Rea3 Kg8": "at this point, Black offered a draw; which I declined for no particular reason... apart from the fact, that I saw no longer a way to win this for Black...",
        "37. Ke2": "White needs to find a way to penetrate Blacks' Kings' wing... Ra6, Kf8, h4, will not work...",
        "37... f6 38. Kf3 Kf7 39. Kg4 Rb7 40. h4 g6 41. f4 h5+ 42. Kf3 exf4 43. Kxf4 Rb5 44. Ke3 Rb7": "best here is Re5, Ra5, Re7, but White cannot profit...",
        "45. Ra3a6 Rd7 46. Ra1a5 Rb7 47. Kf4 Rb4 48. Rd5 Rb7": "by now, it was dawning on me; Rb7 would always guarantee a draw...",
        "49. Rdd6 g5+ 50. Kf5 gxh4": "or Rb5+, Rd5, Rxd5+, exd5, gxh4...",
        "51. Rdxf6+ Kg7 52. Rfg6+ Kh7 53. Rgh6+ Kg8 54. Rxh5": "after Rag6+, Rg7, Rxg7+, Kxg7, Rxh5, Rxa7, Rxh4, White is also a pawn ahead, but after Re7, e5, Kf7, there is no way to win for White... all theory...",
        "54... Raxa7 55. Rxa7 Rxa7 56. Rxh4 Ra6 57. e5 Kf7 58. Rh6": "of course meaning to play Rh7+, Ke8, to drive the Black King out of opposition, only to realize that e5 can never enter the sixth row, due to eternal checks by the Black rook; instead, I managed to produce this losing blunder... lucky for me, this opponent was courteous enough to accept a draw..."
