        "1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3": "This move stops the e5's Budapest. Does it?",
        "2... e5": "I can get something back for the pawn (if Nxe5) by Bb4+, d6, etc. Maybe.",
        "3. e3": "White blunders with this move. Not easy to see why, but for sure, what happens if...",
        "3... e4": "White loses a tempo reatreating the N, while I'll be able to defend e4 with d5. Wonderful. ",
        "4. Nfd2 d5 5. c4": "Natural and almost forced to develop without being squeezed in. ",
        "5... Bb4": "? Not a particularly good idea, since I'll have to exchange this B with a WN. ",
        "6. a3 Bxd2+ 7. Nxd2": "Now my problem is easier to understand: after cxd5, I can't take it back with the N (or Nxe4), but Qxd5, Bc4 is bad. I can't allow that. ",
        "7... Bg4": "Trying to do sometihing more than c6. After cxd, cxd, White has a strong attack on the white diagonal (a4-e8) I must be aware of. ",
        "8. Be2": "Wonderful! I have another try... like...",
        "8... h5 9. Bxg4": "? Maybe better was h3, forcing me into the exchange. Anyway. This represent an unique opportunity to open the h column for my rook, and keep white distracted from d5. ",
        "9... hxg4 10. O-O": "? Instead of attacking, castling just into the enemy's fire is a common mistake. Don't overestimate castling. ",
        "10... Qd6": "Mate threat in one. ",
        "11. g3": "Practically forced. Now my attack will go on... on the h column, with the Q. If I could remove Nf6 from the board... Qxg4 will stop my plans. But I need my Q on h. So let's make the hard way. ",
        "11... Qe6": "Without the lsb, cxd just helps me. But my Q's journey proved very costly. See how. ",
        "12. Qb3": "b7 is threatened, and I should have played b6, and if Qb5+, c6. White needs more tempos to penetrate. But I let him in!",
        "12... Qf5": "ONe move from a nasty mate threat. Go on, take my R!",
        "13. Qxb7": "...but I realized now that white doesn't have to take the R... after my Q is gone to h5, Qc8+, Qxc7+. I shield it with my N and everything should be ok. ",
        "13... Qh5 14. h4 gxh3 e.p. 15. Kh2": "! The good one! But now, ",
        "15... Ng4+ 16. Kh1": "...and here I \"had\" to break in somehow. I bet my life on it...",
        "16... Nxe3": "Let's see. As a sac, Nxf2+ was more accurate. ",
        "17. fxe3 Qe2": "!? This lets again white with the choice to take both R (Qc8, QxRh8, or Qxa8). But it threatens mate on g2 all the same, so white has only one move. ",
        "18. Rg1": "How to go on? I could only see...",
        "18... h2": "...but this time, Qc8+, Ke7, QxRh8, hxRg1=Q+, KxQ, Qxe6+, Kg2, Qxd4... I'll look into it deeper later. ",
        "19. Rf1": "!? now white is a move from adding Rxf7+ to his possible threats! Is black dead???",
        "19... Rh3": "?? Qc8+ wins it. Say I played Rh5, please... :-)",
        "20. Qxd5": "Preferring the check threat to the R. ",
        "20... c6": "Saving the R. I'm feeling busted. ",
        "21. Qxf7+": "Now I got the way to win. But Re1 must go out of there. Can you see it? No, not Qe1+ or Qd1+ (Re1 and back and forth). ",
        "21... Kd8 22. Qf8+": "Come on, white, come on... ",
        "22... Kc7 23. Rf7+": "Done! I was already sure my opponent didn't realized that by doing so, he gave me an one-move mate threat. If he doesn't mate me, I win!",
        "23... Nd7": "Go on, take my R! Take my N with your and try to give a perpetual to me...",
        "24. Qxg7": "?? Overlooking the mate threat. Of course, after Qe1+, Nf1 would follow. So?",
        "24... Qg2+": "A little brilliancy... ",
        "25. Kxg2 h1=Q+ 26. Kf2 Rh2#": "And that's all folks! Don't follow my examples, just have fun with them! :-)"
