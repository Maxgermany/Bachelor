        "30... a5": "This 30th move is where I believe black erred. He put both queen side pawns on black squares, one under attack from a bishop, one from another pawn. If your opponent only has one bishop, it is frequently good to put your pawns on that color, to restrict the bishop. On the other hand, I always say there is an exception to every rule! His two queen side pawns are not stable enough. He ended up losing both pawns (one traded, one taken for free), which left his king open to attack. To defend his king he had to sack his queen for a rook, then white got a 2nd queen, and it was downhill from there. I say instead of 30. ... a5, black had 2 feasible game plans at his disposal:\n\n1. He could have played 30. ... Rd1 +, as he did play on the next move, after messing up his pawn structure! If 31. QxR then QxR. Or if 31. Ka2 then Qd5+. Blacks pawns would still be intact, and his king a lot safer. He could then choose to play 32. ... b5 to keep the queen out.\n\n2. Or he could have played 30. ... b5. With the pawns on white squares and white only having a DSB, black's pawns would come under less attack. \n\nBlack would then have a slightly inferior pawn structure. White would have a queen side pawn majority (3-2), black a king side pawn majority (4-3). White would have a passed c-pawn, but it's well blockaded by a queen which would be hard to move, since the rook can't get in, the bishop is on dark squares, and the queen, if she gets in can be traded. Black has a backward g-pawn, but it is well defended.\n\nSo the pawn inferiority would be hard to take advantage of in my opinion, and black should have a good game.",
