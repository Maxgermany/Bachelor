        "4. Bf4": "4.cxd5 and 4.Nf3 are also good,but this move suits my style.",
        "4... Bg7 5. e3": "Developing natuarally.",
        "5... dxc4": "?! from a psychological standpoint this move is bad.Black plays the Gruenfeld just to play like a QGA.",
        "6. Bxc4 O-O": "? A bad mistake! 6...c5 is better.7.dxc5 Qa5 with Nf6-e4 threatened,but White would still have a slight advantage",

        "12... Qd7": "?? the decisive mistake.Itis hard to suggest any productive moves in Black's position though.Maybe best is 12...Rc8 but after 13.Na3 White still looks better.",
