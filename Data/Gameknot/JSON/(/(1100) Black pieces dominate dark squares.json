        "4. e5": "Signaling a transposition into an e5-chain structure, more typical of the French defense or Caro-Kann openings. The more popular 4 ed, drawing out the black Q early, is trickier for me to handle.",
        "4... Bg4": "Relieved of the burden of having to solve the problem of premature Q development which 4 ed would have caused, the black LSB is able to achieve a thematic e5-chain strategy: activating/exchanging off the 'bad' hemmed in LSB.",

        "12. Nc3 Bd4 13. Bb2 Bxe5 14. Na4 Qd6": "Gripping more Q side dark squares.",
        "15. Rfe1 Bxb2 16. Nxb2 Nf6 17. Rac1 O-O 18. Nc4": "18 Nc4?, this time trouble blunder costs white a piece with no compensation.",
