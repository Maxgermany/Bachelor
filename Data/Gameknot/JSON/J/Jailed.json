        "3. e5 Bf5 4. Nf3 Nd7 5. Be2 f6": "...e6 looks better because it protects the bishop.",
        "6. Nh4": "! Usually it's not wise to put the knight on the edge.  Usually it's not wise to move the same piece twice in the opening.  But here white either wins the bishop pair or black has to play the ugly ...Be6.  (Be4 is met with e6 Nb6. Bh5+ where white is winning after f3)",
        "6... Bg6": "? Understandable but still bad.  The best was actually ...Be6, which prevented white's next move.",
        "7. e6": "A bolt of lightning!  Suddenly half of black's pieces are permanently out of play.",
        "7... Nb6 8. Nxg6": "Gaining the bishop pair.",
        "8... hxg6 9. Qd3": "Winning the pawn on g6.",
        "9... Qd6 10. Qxg6+": "Displacing the king.",
        "10... Kd8 11. Qf7": "This may look strange, but I felt that I had to protect e6.  This also keeps the black bishop jailed and forces black's next move.",
        "11... Kc7 12. h3": "h2 was threatened.",
        "12... Nh6 13. Bxh6": "Forced if I don't want to give back the pawn.",
        "13... Rxh6 14. c3": "I played this over Nc3 because I wanted the knight on c5 via a d2, b3, c5 maneuver.",
        "14... Na4 15. b3 Nb6": "? Missing important counterplay.  Best was Qf4, threatening Qc1+ and then winning the c-pawn.  I would have responded with 0-0.  But the resulting position is better for black than the text.",
        "16. a4 Rd8 17. a5": "Where's the knight to go?",
        "17... Na8": "I think Nc8 was better, though not by much.",
        "18. Bg4 g6 19. Ra2": "Rook lift to e2.",
        "19... Kb8": "To give his knight a square.",
        "20. Re2 Nc7 21. Re3 f5": "Better was ...c5, which would create play on the d-file, where black is strongest.",
        "22. Bf3 f4 23. Re5": "Shutting off the queen and threatening f4.  Note that, just by glancing at the board, white's h-pawn could become deadly if black doesn't create complications soon, as black has no means to stop its advance.",
        "23... g5 24. Rxg5": "I decided to make this pawn trade to gain a passed pawn.",
        "24... Rxe6+": "My e-pawn finally falls.",
        "25. Kf1": "I considered Kd1 but decided against that because the d-file is in risk of opening.  My \"trapped\" rook belongs on h1 anyway, to support the h-pawn advance.",
        "25... Rf6 26. Qh7 Ne6": "Again, ...c5 is indicated.",
        "27. Rg6": "Exchanging rooks would weaken black's kingside defenses.",
        "27... Ng5": "?? And here my opponent was in deep time trouble from defending such a difficult position.  Correct was ...c5 or ...Nc7.  Interesting is ...Nxd4, and after Rxf6 Qxf6 cxd4 Qxd4, black has only one pawn for the piece, but suddenly it is white who has inactive pieces and no real play.",
        "28. Rxg5": "Thank you all for commenting and rating."
