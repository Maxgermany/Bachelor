        "1. e4": "Mini-tournament game, I'm playing my favorite open game again.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "And there she is, the Ruy Lopez, just what I always wanted.",
        "3... Nf6 4. d3 Bc5 5. c3 O-O 6. O-O": "Generic developing moves for both sides.",
        "6... d5 7. Nbd2": "A handy move to prevent an early trade of queens. Also a way to get to e3 or g3 via f1 after the almot inevitable Re1 or Rd1.",
        "7... dxe4 8. dxe4 Bg4 9. h3 Bh5 10. Bxc6": "Breaking up the pawn structure.",
        "10... bxc6 11. Qa4": "Attacking the broken pawns and defending the e4 pawn that would be in danger after black plays 11. ... Bxf3 12. Nxf3 (else the king's castle is ruined with 12. gxf3) Nxe4.",
        "11... Qe7 12. Qxc6": "Taking the free pawn doesn't remove the queen's defense of e4. 11. ... Qe7? may have been a bit of a blunder, since black didn't have to give away the pawn. However, it was a doubled and isolated pawn and it was doomed to a short lifespan either way.",
        "12... Rab8 13. b4 Bd6 14. Rd1": "Rook on the open file, even though it's choked with white knights and well-defended black bishops.",
        "14... Rb6 15. Qc4 Rd8 16. Qe2": "Feeling the need for more homeland security.",
        "16... Qe8 17. g4 Bg6 18. g5": "Not the usual follow up. I frequently follow g5 with Nh4 and trade my knight for black's bishop, doing damage to the king's castle in the process. This time, the black knight looks more vulnerable. Probably the safe move here is 18. ... Nd7.",
        "18... Nh5 19. Nc4": "A fork that accomplishes little, but it does drive back the black rook.",
        "19... Rb7 20. Nfxe5": "19. ... Rb7? was a mistake. It allows white to win a pawn. The rook on d8 needed a defender and is only defended by the black queen who is doing double duty defending e5.",
        "20... Bxe5 21. Rxd8 Qxd8 22. Nxe5": "White has gained a second pawn, establishing a 4-3 kingside advantage and a 3-2 queenside advantage, with the added bonus that black's two queenside pawns are both isolated.",
        "22... Rb8 23. Nc6": "Oops. Black walked into a blunder here, and white jumps at the chance to add to his material lead by winning the exchange. Funny thing is, I almost was afraid to play 23. Nc6. It felt like a trap. Why would black give this away if he didn't have something sneaky planned in response? I looked and looked, but found no traps, so finally went for it and got an immediate resignation from my opponent."
