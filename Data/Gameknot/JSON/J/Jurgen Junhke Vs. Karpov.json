        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "Ruy Lopez",
        "3... a6": "Pretty standard.",
        "4. Ba4": "Retreat variation.",
        "4... Nf6": "Morphy defense.",
        "5. d4": "5.d4!? This is some variation of the centre attack. I've never seen it ever being played. I think the idea is if 5. ... exd4 6. e5. This line shouldn't be too effective against Karpov.",
        "5... exd4 6. O-O Be7": "This transposes into the centre attack. Black develops the dark squared bishop while breaking the pin on his king.",
        "7. e5": "Attacks the knight and gains space.",
        "7... Ne4": "Nice position for the knight. Since the E file is closed, the square isn't so bad.",
        "8. Nxd4": "Regains the lost pawn.",
        "8... O-O": "Black finally safeguards his king.",
        "9. Nf5": "Future threats on g7 and provoking d6 or g6.",
        "9... d5": "Attacks the knight.",
        "10. Bxc6": "Shatters blacks pawn structure.",
        "10... bxc6 11. Nxe7+ Qxe7 12. Re1": "Black doesn't want to play Qxe5 because that just drops a knight after f3.",
        "12... Re8": "This move is silent but deadly. It contains a little trap.",
        "13. f3": "It's understandable that you want to chase the knight away and open the file up.",
        "13... Nd6": "The knight is immune because if 14. exd6 qxe1+ 15. Qxe1 Rxe1+ 16. Kf2 Rxc1. Up a rook and in a winning position.",
        "14. b3 Nf5": "Black has more active pieces. White is still cramped and struggling to develop.",
        "15. Ba3": "Attacks the queen. This move isn't too effective as the e7 wasn't the best place for the queen. Better was probably Bb2. Nd2 is playable.",
        "15... Qg5 16. Bb2": "16. Bb2? A waste of time. He seems to know of blacks attack. Better here was Qd2 trying to exchange queens.",
        "16... Nh4": "Threatening mate.",
        "17. Qd2": "Offering the exchange of queens and protecting g2.",
        "17... f6 18. Qf2 Bh3": "Attacks g2 a third time. Will whtie be able to withstand blacks attack?",
        "19. g4": "Completely understandable. Now one attacker is gone.",
        "19... fxe5": "Now black is a pawn up in a winning position.",
        "20. Nd2": "Although white develops his knight this completely loses. Better was Nc3 or Qg3 or Qe3.",
        "20... Qxd2": "Karpov finishes Junhke with a tactical shot. If 21. Qxd2, Black will win the queen baack with Nxf3 and then Nxd2. If white tries Nxh4 then Qg2# If any other move he's down a knight and a pawn and will have to survive an attack. Junhke was only an amateur at the time."
