    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5": "I'm not surprised that Charles played this.  He must have studied plenty of my openings.  And, he has annotated games where he's played this defense.",
        "2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5": "Nothing was new for me, until this move.  But, I'm not used to this.  Furthermore, I'm thinking about what his Nc3 might be able to do.",
        "6... Qa5": "So, I try something very different then what's normal.  Generally speaking, especially against stronger opposition, it's not wise to bring your Q out early.  But, that didn't mean a thing to me here.  That's because bhidragon advised to stop digging in my bag of chess quotes, but instead see the picture.  With that being said, I'm thinking about what I've learned with the N visualization count on how many squares it can travel.  This is what makes them dangerous.  So, I was thinking about how to pin it.  Of course, my Bf8 is not an option.  If I didn't continue with the normal 2...d6 which is what you do in this defense, I would've played 6...e5 to allow 7...Bb4.  Since it's not an option, this was the only other way to pin.  And, I felt like trying something different.  Of course, the idea is that I know I'm gonna lose anyway, so trying something different against players like Charles is an excellent way to learn as reversion has told me.  He even implied once to try something like the Scandinavian Defense, or if I had played 1...e5 to try the Petrov Defense.  But, I'm specifically, going by what I learned from GM Susan Polgar since I have the most amount of experience with the Sicilian.  But, it's after the mainline of what I'm familiar that I then go ahead and try something new which is what happened here.",
        "7. Qd2": "As noted, I was interested on how Charles was going to react to my unorthodox move.  I anticipated 7.Bd2.  As then, after moving the N, my Q is attacked which forces me to retreat gaining him plenty of tempii.  But, this move makes me feel happy knowing that if worse comes to worse, I can exchange if attacked by his Q.  This will later on.",
        "7... g6": "?! With that being said, I go back to my focus on development by fianchettoing as I like having a nice long diagonal for one of my B's.  What I forgot, however, is that he will force an exchange, so this was not a great move.  Though not blunderous, this would've been the time to for something because this is just an obvious fact that I looked at.  But, ION's told fiercequeen that I should look at more then the obvious moves.  That didn't happen here as this was played because it was obvious and natural to me.  However, to explore a little better, at the very least, I should've considered my Nf6 because this move is going to double up my pawns in a bad way.  Although not destroyed yet, my K side pawn structures are now weak and vulnerable.",
        "8. Bxf6 exf6 9. O-O-O": "As now, Charles has castled.  And, what's more is that not only do I have a ways to go before I can castle, but I'm way behind in development which also isn't good.",
        "9... Bg7": "? Therefore, I start planning a way to catch up and do something about my weakened K side pawn structures by completing the fianchetto.  Of course, my plan is to castle in the near future.  However, this is my first mistake because of what happens next.  Therefore, all other moves was better then this.  And, had I known what was about to unfold, I would've developed my Nb8 or Bc8.",
        "10. Nb3": "Not surprisingly, this is where Charles starts harassing my Q for bringing it out early.  But, this is more then I thought, as this move is guaranteed to win a pawn.  This is also why I shouldn't have moved my DSB from f8.  Little did I realize that my d pawn was gone until he captured.",
        "10... Qd8 11. Qxd6": "I figured it out here and was going to retreat to avoid exchanging as there's no immediate benefit.  However, after Charles harassed my Q and then some with 10.Nb3, I decided not to take a chance anymore.  They say that if you bring the Q out early, it will constantly be harassed.  That is, unless you exchange it.  That's why I decided to do it.  As now, he will no longer be harass it, and that will allow me to get another piece developed.  With that being said despite being a pawn down, after 12.Rxd6, I feel very happy about where I stand.",
        "11... Qxd6 12. Rxd6 O-O": "? This is one of the reasons and my favorite moment of the game knowing that my K is now safe as I did something about the weakened K pawn structure.  However, it is a mistake as I looked at only what I'm comfortable and just my K side.  But, I overlooked what he's about to do and it's not pretty.  Best would've been 12...Be6 to prevent that.  With that being said, although not right away, the game is officially lost for black.",
        "13. Nd5": "This move surprised me a bit because the idea is, of course, that Charles is threatening 14.Nc7.  But, there's more to it then meets the eye, so per",
        "13... Nc6": "So, I did something about it knowing that if he does that, I can defend.  But, that's a problem as it's, once again, only the obvious.  And, I didn't look at anything further then that.  The next move is worse then I thought because Charles not only wins another pawn, but in the aftermath, my King is now exposed.  Unlike before, there's nothing that I can do about it.  Whereas, had I played 12...Be6 and he answered with 13.Nd5, I would've answered with 13...Bxd5 to prevent this.",
        "14. Nxf6+ Kh8": "With that being said, exchanging would only leave my K more vulnerable.  And, I didn't want to do it since I am behind.",
        "15. Nc5": "I don't know what Charles plan is, but I don't like both of his N's being there.  So, I sense it's something really bad with where I am as I have seen similar plans.  Perhaps, it might even be weakening the K even more by doing something like sacking a N for a pawn since that has been done in other games.  ",
        "15... Bh6+": "Thus, I placed Charles in check to delay this.",
        "16. Kb1 Bf4": "And, I go right after his R which Charles defend.  Of course the idea is that when you're losing, \"Play the man, not the board\".  Well, that's what I'm trying to do here.",
        "17. Rd1 b6": "With that being said, I attack his N.  In addition, this is a double fianchetto which is rare.  But, since it didn't start off with a KID and the fact that I'm nearly lost, I felt that it worked here.",
        "18. Nd3 Bg5": "In response to Charles attacking, I do what I call countercounterattack since he counterattacked on his last move.",
        "19. Nd5 Bb7": "Taking advantage of the double fianchetto.  In addition, I have just completed my development.",
        "20. f4": "But, this allows him to attack my B.",
        "20... Bd8": "However, I am forced to undevelop it as anything would lose the B, or at the very least force liquidation which I'm not ready for yet.",
        "21. g3": "Fiachettoing his B.",
        "21... Re8": "But, I start my own plan by centralizing my R and attacking his center pawn.",
        "22. Bg2": "And, Charles defends that pawn.",
        "22... b5": "Having a little Ghost Vision, I thought that my b pawn was attacked which is why I played this.  But, I forgot that it was protected by my Bd8.",
        "23. Nc5": "But, this allows Charles to go after my Bb7.",
        "23... Bc8": "Forcing me to undevelop it.",
        "24. h3": "I am not sure why Charles played this.",
        "24... Rb8": "It wouldn't have been possible to get my Bd8 out of where it was.  But, this move, however, now makes it possible for me to do that which is why I played this move.",
        "25. e5": "I don't know why he made this move.  But, considering where I am, it doesn't change what I play next as I follow through on my plan.  This time, the idea isn't a swindle, but as noted, it was just about finding a better placement for my DSB which is what I'm about to do.",
        "25... Bb6 26. Ne4": "As he kept in mind how dangerous his N.  So, I tried to intimidate him.  The idea would be to exchange with 26.Nxd5 to protect the other N.  Not surprisingly, he refused by defending that N.",
        "26... Rd8": "So, I centralized by half pinning the N.  As I figured that I was placing pressure against Charle's center.  But, I am mistaken because of what he's about to play next.  In fact, this was not a good plan because I am about to be forced to liquidate which is not something that I had in mind. ",
        "27. Nxb6": "As I had looked at 27...Nxb6??.  But, that was to discover that the only way to prevent further loss of material was to exchange on d1 which is not something that I had in mind.",
        "27... Rxd1+ 28. Rxd1 Rxb6 29. Rd6": "! After exchanging, I knew that damage would be done.  But, I didn't think that Charles would do this damage right away.  Surely, I was lost, but this move wins very quickly, as now being indirectly pinned, my N is tied down.  Therefore, I'm losing mobility, but it's about to get a lot worse.",
        "29... Bb7": "My thought was that Charles is trying to win my N.  The idea is that once he moves his Ne4, my Nc6 is attacked twice and only defended once.  Therefore, I responded with this move, as I thought that this ended all of my troubles.  But, my assessment was incorrect.",
        "30. Nc5": "As I am attacked a third time, and I have no third defense.  It didn't occur to me right away, but I played several variations.  And, in all of them, no matter what I do, on top of what he has, Charles is going to win an additional piece without anything in return.  That leaves me down by the equivalent to an entire R.  That's when I realized that there's nothing else to get or learn by playing on.  So, I resigned."
