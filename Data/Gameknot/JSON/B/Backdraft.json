        "1. a4": "A dreadful opening move, even for blitz.",
        "1... c5": "Would 2. B4 undermine black's attempt to set up a Sicilian/English opening..?",
        "2. a5": "Is white congenitally immuno-compromised..? ",
        "2... Nc6 3. g3": "Finally a sensible move; 3.g3 followed by Bg2 could work together with the a5 push, weakening the B7 square...",
        "3... d5 4. Bg2 Nf6": "This move seems natural, as I wish to avoid ...e6.",
        "5. c3": "An interesting move.  It is surprisingly difficult to calculate whether white's d4 break would pose a substantial danger...",
        "5... Bg4": "A controversial move.  Perhaps black has lost his advantage.",
        "6. a6": "A crap move.",
        "6... b6 7. c4": "7...d4 or 7...dxc is an obvious mistake.",
        "7... e6": "Outside of the pawn chain, blacks LSB looks like it can be harried...",
        "8. cxd5 exd5 9. Qa4": "I think this threat is easily parried...  Perhaps 9. Nf3 was stronger...",
        "9... Qd7 10. Nc3": "Black's position is superior in my view.",
        "10... Be7 11. Nxd5": "White is just losing material here.",
        "11... Nxd5 12. Bxd5 Qxd5 13. f3 Bd7": "The black position plays itself.",
        "14. e4 Qd3": "I had thought that ...Bh3 followed by Nxh3 and ...Qf3+ was playable, but it is not in light of Nf2.",
        "15. Ra3 Qd6 16. Ne2 Ne5 17. Qb3 O-O": "Enabling ...Be6",
        "18. h4 Rfe8": "I am not so sure about this move.  Maybe an immediate ...Bd6 was better.",
        "19. h5": "I did not want to play ...h6 and risk white's playing d4.",
        "19... Be6 20. Qc3 Bf6 21. h6 g6": "And I think black's position will be fine.  Of course, I will have to watch the long diagonal, now that white has attained a thorn pawn -- his only achievement thus far.",
        "22. f4": "White is getting some counter play here, after ...Ng4.",
        "22... Ng4 23. e5": "Maybe ...Qc6 was good here as well.",
        "23... Nxe5": "But I am happy to return the material, with advantage.",
        "24. fxe5 Bxe5 25. Qf3 Bxb2": "Not the classiest continuation.  However, I was under time trouble, and was trying to clear the e-file for a discovered check on white's king.",
        "26. Bxb2 Bc4": "For the moment, white cannot play Qf6.",
        "27. Rh2 Rad8 28. Kf1": "White is not going to be able to defend his king, so in this position a more direct attack was called for. ",
