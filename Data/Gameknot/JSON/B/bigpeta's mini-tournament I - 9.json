        "3... Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. g3": "I ummed and ahhhed about NxN but in the end opted for developing my major pieces  so g3 making room for Bg2",
        "6... Qb6 7. e3": "Nxc6 wasn't an option as his queen would end up on c6 compromising my Rook on h1",
        "7... Bb4 8. Bd2": "Candidate moves were Ne3 or Bd2 so Bd2 developed the game ",
        "8... Nxd4 9. exd4": "Not much option here",
        "9... Qxd4 10. Qe2": "The Q needs to get into the action. I suspect Pete move his N into the attack next.",
        "10... d5 11. O-O-O": "It seems the expedient thing to move the King from the Q's line of fire and put the rook in its place.....Pete has advised this was a mistake!",
        "11... Qxc4 12. Qxc4": "Well I figure a Q swap is my best option here....",
        "12... dxc4 13. Nb5 Bxd2+ 14. Rxd2": "The decision was which to take with ...King or Rook?   I decided not to block the rook in and it also gives me a line on an open file.",
        "14... Ke7 15. Bxc4 Bd7 16. Nc3": "I don't want to do an exchange which would leave Pete with a N and me with a B in the end game. Nc3 to give me time to move the king who is vulnerable on c file",
        "16... Rac8 17. Bd3": "Pete's going to attack with Nd5 now.....",
        "17... Nd5 18. Rc2": "If Nxc3 then Rxc3 I'm on the defensive here...not good.",
        "18... Nb4 19. Rd2": "this is a sad sad game now!  If I didn't move my Rook it was lost and now my K is pinned by the N. I had thought of Nd5+ but would have ended up losing my N for nothing",
        "19... Nxa2+ 20. Kb1": "I'm going to lose the pawn after NxN b2xN Rxc3",
        "20... Nxc3+ 21. bxc3 Rxc3 22. Kb2": "I figure that I need to get my king out of the corner and off the white squares ....thought about Rd2 or Rc1. ",
        "22... Rc5 23. Rc2": "a new day a new perspective.  I needed to get the B and Rook off the same file ....offering again a Rook swap.",
        "23... Rxc2+ 24. Bxc2 a5 25. Rc1": "Want to get the rook out and on an open file  also get a barrier his king can't move over as all the action I suspect will initially be on the Queen side of the board.",
        "25... b5 26. Bd3": "I needed to get the B and R off the same file. If he moves Rc8 then RxR BxR and Bxb5.",
        "26... Rb8": "As all the action is on the Queen side every plan I had could be countered easily by Pete so it was a no win situation (3 pawns down) so resigned at this stage as believed I wouldn't learn anything more by going through the pain.....of checkmate!"
