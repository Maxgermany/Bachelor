        "1... e5": "Counter claim on centre.",
        "2. e3": "Preparing for later d4 thrust.",
        "2... Bc5": "Blacks Bishop is biting on granite there..but he is stopping an immediate d4.",
        "3. Be2": "Just developing bits on Kingside and tempting him to play e4 prematurely.",
        "3... Nf6": "Natural development.",
        "4. Nc3": "just getting me bits out.",
        "4... c6": "Preparing the freeing d5 push.",
        "5. Nf3": "This is a mistake...if black plays an immediate e4 I'm jumping straight back to g1 and then playing f3 to open up the f file for my kings rook after I castle kingside.",
        "5... O-O 6. O-O d6": "Black is supporting e5...it looks like he really doesn't want to push d4.",
        "7. a3": "OK lets start some play on the Queenside and get some pawns rolling and get my black squared Bishop active on the long diagonal a1-h8 then I can connect my rooks.",
        "7... a6": "Looks likme black has similar ideas and he is also creating a retreat square for his Bishop.",
        "8. b4": "As per plan.",
        "8... Ba7 9. Bb2": "That's a better square for me old Bishop.",
        "9... Be6 10. d4": "I'm going to push for as much space as I can.",
        "10... e4 11. d5": "Gross error..chess blindness!...I was thinking of pushing d5 when I made my last move (d4).  When I returned to the game I automatically played it without even noticing that my knight was threatened!!",
        "11... cxd5": "Surely black should have playedexf3 winning a piece.",
        "12. cxd5": "Another bad error.  Black could still win a piece by exf3...I don't believe I just played exd5 especially because I was already alerted to the danger of black playing exf3!",
        "12... Bd7": "That really lets me off the hook.",
        "13. Nd2 Bf5 14. Qb3": "Now I can start to build up a lot of pressure on the Queenside.",
        "14... Nbd7 15. Rac1 Rc8 16. Rc2": "I want to double my rooks then rip up the c file.",
        "16... Ng4": "I can win a pawn here.",
        "17. Bxg4 Bxg4 18. Ndxe4 Ne5": "Lets get shot of that Bishop and stop the knight coming to g4 later.   I'll play h3",
        "19. h3 Qh4": "Oh damn!...I didn't see that coming at all!\nSuddenly I am in a lot of trouble.  He can play Bxh3 and after gxh3 he plays Qxh3 and his knight can come safely to g4 with mate threatened.  I need to do something quickly all my pieces are trapped on the Queenside and I am caught wrong footed.  It is difficult to defend.",
        "20. Ne2": "I think I can just about wriggle out of things with Ne2 because I am now attacking his knight one5 and I can chop it off just in the nick of time.  Yes Ne2.",
        "20... Bxh3": "OK ...I can't take the Bishop because he gets a mating attack with Nf3+ then Qxe4 threatening an unstoppable double check then mate.",
        "21. Ne4g3": "N4f3...removes my unprotected Knight from e4 as well as guarding the e4 square it also gives me breathing time to whip his knight off and take the wind out of his attack.   If he plays Nf3+ I just take it and I get 2 pieces for my rook when he takes on F1 with his Bishop.   \n\nIf he takes on g2 straight away I just take back with my King and if he plays Ng4 to threaten mate I can bring my rook to h1...yes it looks safe..N4g3.  ",
        "21... Bd7": "That Knight has got to go pronto.  Bxe5 ",
        "22. Bxe5 dxe5 23. Rfc1": "Double the rooks on the open file...can't be bad.",
        "23... Qe7 24. e4": "Stabalising the centre.",
        "24... Qe8 25. Rc2c7": "Grab the 7th rank while it's up for grabs.",
        "25... Rxc7 26. Rxc7 Bb6 27. Rxb7": "Might as well gobble up the pawn on offer..it looks safe..if he playsBc8 I just playRa8 and its safe because its pinning his Bishop against his Queen.",
        "27... Bd4 28. Nxd4": "I think I can win another pawn here forking his pawns on d4 and a6 with my Queen.",
        "28... exd4 29. Qd3 Bb5 30. Qxd4": "may as well grab the extra material.",
        "30... Qc8 31. Nf5": "Nf5 looks pretty good.  Multiple threats.  Mate on g7 or forking the Queen with e7  He can't take the rook and my king is safe...he has a couple of checks on c1 then on f4 but it 's no problem.  Yes Nf5 looks excellent.",
        "31... Qc1+ 32. Kh2 Qg5": "OK ..I don't want to playg3 because his Bishop zooms into f1 with a mating attack..so easiest is just to face off Queens..if he exchanges I've got an easy push down the centre with me prawns.",
        "33. Qe3": "inviting the exchange of Queens for an easy endgame.",
        "33... Qf6 34. Qf4 Bf1 35. Ne7+": "Forcing the exchange of Queens and an easy endgame.",
        "35... Kh8 36. Qxf6": "Off she comes!",
        "36... gxf6 37. a4": "Just to stop his Bishop coming back to b5 which would make queening the d pawn a bit harder.",
        "37... h5 38. d6": "Just an easy pawn push now.",
        "38... Rd8 39. d7": "Nearly there.",
        "39... Kh7 40. Nc6": "Inviting the rook to vacate the Queening square.",
        "40... Rg8 41. g3": "No point in letting him take my g pawn.  The Queening can wait..he can't stop it.",
        "41... h4 42. Rb8": "I think this is the most efficient....I get to keep the Queen this way.",
        "42... hxg3+": "Doesn't do much but black has nothing else.",
        "43. fxg3": "I don't think can delay the inevitable for much longer.",
        "43... Rxb8": "I'm very surprised black hasn't resigned yet.",
        "44. Nxb8": "NxR Naturally.",
        "44... Bd3 45. d8=Q": "Obviously I must Queen the pawn.",
        "45... Bxe4 46. Qxf6": "Restrict the King as much as possible for a mating net.",
        "46... Bg6": "He's obviously playing for a draw by stalemate...not going to happen!",
        "47. Nxa6": "Just Queen another pawn and mate in the corner.  OK He's had enough and resigns next move."
