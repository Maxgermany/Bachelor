        "1. c4 f5 2. g4": "I have a friend (who's a rather stronger player than I am) who loves playing the Dutch. Except he doesn't much love playing it against me anymore, after I began playing the Krejcik against him. He's tried several systems against it, and still hasn't found a sure antidote. There's something about the Krejcik ... it handles more soundly, more playably, following 1. c4 than it does following 1. d4. I dunno. I just know that springing it after 1. c4 f5 I've gotten excellent results against pretty much everyone.",
        "2... fxg4 3. h3 gxh3 4. Nxh3 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. d4": "For the investment of a pawn White has conjured up some advantages that everyone wants to get out of the opening, a lead in development and a Kingside attack already bubbling in the pot. But let's not forget that White is also a pawn in the red AND has a completely blown Kingside; therefore the first player must play actively and tactically, seeking to open lines and get his attack off the ground before Black has the chance to consolidate and make his material advantage felt.",
        "6... exd4 7. Qxd4 Nc6 8. Qd1 d6 9. Bg5 Be7 10. Bg2 h6": "Oh, those light-square weaknesses on h5 and g6 are like Halloween candy to a chubby kid.",
        "11. Bxf6 Bxf6 12. Nf4 Ne5": "--?-- 12. ...Bf5! is better.",
        "13. Qc2 O-O": "--?-- Another flub. Stiffer was 13. ...c6. Now, suddenly, White wins by force.",
        "14. Bd5+ Kh8 15. Ng6+ Nxg6 16. Qxg6 Qe8 17. Rxh6+": "--!!-- Ouch! Black resigns."
