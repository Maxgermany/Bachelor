        "1... c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "3. Bb5 - this is I think the Nimsovich-Rossolimo attack in response to the Sicilian - recommended as a strong line in the database.",
        "3... e6 4. O-O Nge7 5. c3 a6 6. Ba4 b5": "6. .......... b5 - this kinda resembles a Ruy Lopez.  Frere Leblanc does have the foxhole c2 to escape the queenside pawn roll avoiding the Noah's Ark Trap.",
        "7. Bc2 g6 8. d4 c4": "8. ........ c4?? - I think this is the move that causes black to lose at least a piece.",
        "9. d5 exd5 10. exd5 Nb8": "10. ........... Nb8 - black's development goes into reverse!",
        "11. d6": "11.  d6!! - here it is, one little tiny pawn move, but this stab is going to net a piece because although the knight can sidestep the pawns attack, Re1  is going to cook black's goose big time because the rook cannot be captured, the king cannot move and so black must put a piece in the way to be taken by the d6 pawn.",
        "11... Nf5 12. Re1+ Ne7 13. dxe7 Bxe7 14. Bg5 f6": "14. .......... f6?? - compounds the error still more - 14. ......... Nc6 was better, now the black dsb is hopelessly pinned and I simply take the pawn on f6 maintaining this pin and attacking the rook on h8.  After this double attack which will sentence my opponent to a two piece deficit, anthropologist waved the white flag.",
