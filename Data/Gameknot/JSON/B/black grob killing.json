        "12. O-O": "so now the problem is coming, i'm nailed !",
        "12... g4": "this was just searching to win time a maybe to make an oportunity to get out of this stupid trap i put my self ",
        "13. hxg4 h5": "you see the oportunity ?...\r\nif g4 x h5, then qxh5 and mat is coming\r\nif not, h5 x g4 and then i exchange the knights...\r\nwell, i hope !",
        "14. a3 hxg4": "this is my plan\r\nbut it seems to be better instead ! \r\nlets forget the b4 knight and put my queen in h5 !",
        "15. Nd4 Qh5": "so ?\r\n...\r\nyes, it'mat anyway !\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is a perfect exemple of what kind of good games occurs whith grob"
