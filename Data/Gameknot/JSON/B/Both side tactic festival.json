This is good for me because it follows: \n     25. Rxd2+, and black has 3 moves: \n\n1+) 25. ..., Bd7, that is no good for black for\n     26.

Qc5+, and I win, or\n3+) 25. ..., Ke7, that doesn't make me win inmediately, but I keep good tactic resources. \n\nThe second answer for black is\n2+) 24. ..., Rd3.\nWhite can play \n25. Qh4+, that seems to provide good tactics for white, even after\n25. ..., Bg5\n26. Qxg5, QxQ\n26. RxR, Qg7\n27. Rxbd7+, QxR\n28. BxQ, KxB and white is up a piece. \nor: \n25. Bc4, Bg4, \n26. Qh4+ and white ends with more material.\n\nBlack doesn't seem to have other answer, so Bg3 is a good move here, providing equality at least, unless black fails somewhere. \n\nb) 24. Kf1\nIt mantains free the dsb. \n\nIf black takes the bishop\n24. ..., Bxe6, \n25. Rxd2+\nBlack has several answers here, with more or less the same as in the previous analysis, but with two differences. \nThe first is that black has to cope with the threat Be5, that pins the queen.\nThe second is that blacks has the threat Bc4+, Ke1, Qg1#.\n\nIf black covers the king with 24. ..., Bd7, he loses his threat. Whte doesn't have the chance 25. Rxd7+, Qxd7, 26. Rd1 because of Rd3. White can answer\n27. Qh4+, but black has two answers: \n1+) 27. ..., Ke8, that looses material after\n28. Re1+, Kf7, \n29. Qf4+, Kg6, \n30. Qe4+, Kf7\n31. Qc4+, Kf8 (Kg6 looses after Re6+)\n32. Qf4+, Kg8\n33. Be4, where the black rook is trapped, even if black plays Qh3+, 34. Kg1.\n\n2-) 27. ..., Kc8\n28. Qc4+, Qc6\n29. QxR, KxB and material is even! (No use for black to play Qh1+, 30. Ke2, Re8+, 31. Kd2, QxR+, 32. KxQ, 33. Re8, 34. QxR+, KxQ and white has a free bishop!)\n\nAfter 27. Qa5+, Kc8, 28. Rc1+, KxB, 29. Qe4+, Ka7, 30. QxR(h8), etc, material is even again. \n\nSo, 26. Rxd7+ leads only to even result.\n\nBut white can play directly 27. Be5, pinning the black queen. I cannot see any good move for black, but to loose a quality. \nBetter is for black not to cover the king, and again we have 2 moves: \n\n1-) 25. ..., Kc8, that keeps the mate threat over white. white has to care about his rook on a1, too, so he must play 27. Qc5+, KxB, and white has nothing, since 28. Ra1-d1, leads to be mated starting with Bh+.\n\nNo need to analyze Kf8, since it is not difficult for black to find Kc8. \n\nSo 25. Rxd7+ doesn't seem to be a good way to progress for white. \n\nNow, what happens if white plays 25. Qa5+ instead? Nothing. \nAnd what if white plays 25. Qc4? Black gets the hand with Bh3+.\n\nSo no b) Kf1. \n\nc) 24. Kh1 has the disadvantage of Bc6+.\nMy God, even 25. f3 seems to be possible. Bxf3, \n26. Qxf3, Rxf3,\n27. Rxd2+, if Ke7, \n28. Rd7+, and it is better for black to play KxB, that leads to equality (29. RxQ, RxB) than  Kf6 (29. RxQ, KxR, 30. Be5+, Rf6, 31. Rg1+, winning the rook).\n\nBut let's see 25. Bd5.
