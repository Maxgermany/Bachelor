    "moves": {
        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Qe7": "  Not sure this is a regular movement here, seemed not too good to me, but... I couldn\u00b4t find a countermeasure to it.",
        "4. Nc3 c6": "To avoid having 5.Bg5 and 6.Nd5",
        "5. Bc4": "I must admit I was feeling overconfident, and started to pay not much attention to black\u00b4s development, but on the other hand didn\u00b4t think much about my own, and thought developing pieces would give me an upper hand at the end of the opening.\nMaybe 5.Bg5 would have yielded a better defense here, and opens the possibility of a long castling.",
        "5... a6": "Another movement that slows development , in my thought. There must be many better and aggressive alternatives for white here instead of the castling I did, like Ng5, but , again, I didn\u00b4t think much of it, I just wanted to finish the opening and not waste too much time in preemptive attacks.",
        "6. O-O Nf6 7. dxe5": "But I found myself without an idea of what to do. Exchanging pawns did not enhanced white\u00b4s position. Again, Ng5 and then f4 (if possible) seemed more adequate.",
        "7... dxe5 8. h3 g5": "Didn\u00b4t even think much on whether taking or not taking the pawn. I just felt shocked and it was that feeling that made me feel like my position was inferior, much worse than what it was in reality. I tried to look for a counterattack , but then, I found nothing; it seemed that black\u00b4s King is safe enough to focus on attack and I don\u00b4t have much left. It is one of those occasions when you feel like not accepting the gambit, because there must be a good reason not to (opening the column, etc) and yet, it is more than doable (after a light post-game analysis from my side)",
        "9. Re1": "Weak weak movement. How about 9.Nh3. It seems better if defense is the plan here (not to talk about, as previously mentioned, Nxg5, which is much better)",
        "9... g4": "And here comes hell",
        "10. hxg4 Bxg4 11. Be3": "Another movement that is not that active, but the shock was still freezing my mind. I was thinking of a counterattack on my Queen\u00b4s side, but always having the feeling it was for nothing, and blacks attack is unstoppable.",
        "11... Nbd7 12. a4": "TRying some sort of counterattack, not sure what to do.",
        "12... Rg8": "And here comes hell",
        "13. Be2": "Not many ideas left, and enclosing the queen, but threats in f3-g2 are too dangerous.",
        "13... h6": "I guess that it was to provide N in f3 a jump point to reach g5, but it seems to me that it gives white a respite. O-O-O seemed more threatening, but I may be wrong.",
        "14. Qd2 Bh5 15. Bxh6": "Taking h6 was not a happy moment for me, but I was running out of time, and thought I could at least activate my queen somehow. Of course, black now the 8th line completely open. a very interesting sacrifice.",
        "15... Bxh6 16. Qxh6 O-O-O 17. Qe3": "Aiming for a7 and moving the queen to a safer position.",
        "17... Kb8": "HEre is when I spent most of my little time I had left. I thought about Ng5!? and or Bxc6, looking at least for a draw position, but nothing clear came to me, so I tried a slower but safer approach.",
        "18. Ra3 Qe6": "I was paying no attention to black\u00b4s attack here, aiming for a grand finale with a sacrifice, and  thus didn\u00b4t see the incoming attack, thinking Queen\u00b4s move was a waste of time (I was thinking about doubling rooks on g), but...",
        "19. Bxa6 Qg4": "..I thought I was lost. THreats in g2 and also Qxf3 seem way too much. Now, under a minute of time left, I found some sort of defense.",
        "20. Nh4": "!\nGives some time for me to find a drawing position",
        "20... Qxh4 21. Rb3 c5": "Nice defense! I had no clear end for this game, but it was thrilling and beautiful!",
        "22. Rxb7+ Ka8": "Kc8 leads to the same position unless or else draw",
        "23. Nb5": "Threatening Nc7++. I was thinking inc ase of black 23...Rf8, what to do, what to do...24. Ra7+ with 25.Bxf8 doesn\u00b4t seem to compensate. I need to bring the queen into the fight there, but how?",
        "23... Qg4": "Unfortunately (I think the game was now at it\u00b4s most interesting stage) my rival did not see the mate, but it was an amazing player and aggressive, glad to enjoyed these minutes with him. We even tried a new game, in which he kicked my a..s much more easily.\n\n Hope you guys have enjoyed this one!"
