        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4": "I've had a lot of success playing the Evan's Gambit (after 3...Bc5  4. b4!?) so I always aim for that in this position. However, my opponent decided not to oblige me. ",
        "3... d6 4. d4": "Breaking open the centre as soon as possible to target the f7 square. ",
        "4... exd4 5. c3": "I'm in a sacrificial kind of mood:) Anyway, this move allows my queen out to b3 to further increase the pressure on f7 if needed, and if he takes, I can recapture with my knight for a plus in development. ",
        "5... dxc3 6. O-O": "Or, I could do this. ",
        "6... cxb2 7. Bxb2": "So, I'm down two pawns , but on the other hand, my pieces are well developed mostly whereas my opponents pieces are languishing on the back rank. ",
        "7... Nge7": "Yup, its a mistake. When you're playing black here, the thing you have to be conscious of is always the f7 square, as its the easiest for white to target. Black should have played Be6. ",
        "8. Ng5": "And now black has no way of guarding the crucial pawn except Be6, which loses a pawn anyway and opens the black king to attack. However, my opponent didn't play this, he played something much much worse....",
        "8... f6": "You can probably see what happens :)",
        "9. Bf7+ Kd7 10. Ne6": "And after some time my opponent resigned having lost his queen in just 10 moves!"
