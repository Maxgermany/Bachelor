    "moves": {
        "1. Nf3": "A very flexible opening move that could lead anywhere.",
        "1... Nf6 2. b3": "An unexpected continuation.  White clearly plans a Queenside fianchetto attacking Black's potential kingside castled position.  How should Black respond?  He can either choose to oppose the finachetto with one of his own, either Kingside or Queenside, or to develop his bishops centrally.  2...d6 will contest the e5 square and release the wsb.  2...e6 will lay claim to d5 and release the dsb.  Other possibilities were 2. c5, contesting the d4 square and postponing the question of where to develop the Bs, or 2...d5, laying claim to e4, or 2...Nc6, contesting d4 and e5.",
        "2... g6": "I opt to contest the long dark diagonal immediately with my own dsb.  I realise that this could be risky but I feel the need to play combatively.",
        "3. Bb2 Bg7 4. g4 O-O 5. g5": "This pawn's second move may appear to defy opening principles but by attacking the N it forces Black to move that N a second time and prepares to break up Black's castled position, so it is quite justified by the concrete considerations of the actual position on the board.",
        "5... Ne8": "?! defending the B OK but this move is less flexible than 5...Nh5, whence it would also defend the B but it could also have been left there to block the h file if I'd chosen to recapture with my K.  My posture at this stage is entirely defensive: hardly my intention when choosing to fianchetto kingside.",
        "6. Bxg7 Nxg7 7. d4 d6 8. e4 Bg4 9. Be2 Nd7 10. Nbd2 c5": "I preferred this thrust to 10...e5 because I preferred to keep f6 covered by a pawn.  If White takes on c5, I recapture with the N and I preserve my pawn structure, White having loosened his bind on the centre.  If White pushes forward to d5, he leaves me e5 for my N.",
        "11. d5 Rc8 12. h4 a6 13. Nh2 Bxe2 14. Qxe2 b5 15. c4 Qa5": "developing my Q to its most active potential position and pinning White's Nd2.  I'm not actually threatening anything yet though.",
        "16. O-O Ne5 17. f4 Nd7 18. Ng4 Qc3 19. Nf3 Nh5 20. Qd2 Qxd2": "Black had no real choice here as the retreats to b5, g7 or h8 were all very unattractive.",
        "21. Nxd2 f6 22. f5 Kg7 23. Ne3 Ne5 24. a4": "threatening to create an open file down which White's QR can join in the attack from the flank.  e7 looks very vulnerable to such an attack.",
        "24... b4": "I decide that I can't allow the Queenside to be opened.  I can't allow White's R to come down the a-file to threaten e7.",
        "25. Nf3 Nd7 26. Ra2 a5 27. Rg2 Nf4 28. Rg4 Nh5 29. Kh2 Rfg8 30. Rfg1 Kf7 31. Rf1 Rcf8 32. gxf6 exf6 33. fxg6+ hxg6": "So far, White doesn't seem to have achieved much.  He has cleared the f and g files of his pawns but Black's remain...",
        "34. Ng5+": "exploiting the pin",
        "34... Ke7 35. Ne6 Rf7": "leaving the other Rook defenceless but a retreat along the back rank would have meant that any subsequent King retreat would have the same effect.",
        "36. Nf5+": "! exploiting the pin on the g-pawn: if 36...gxf5, 37. Rxg8.  But even if Black avoids this, he is doomed: his only other move is 36...Ke8, when 37. Nxd6+ forks K and Rf7, so 37...Ke7 38. Nxf7 Kxf7 and White has a winning position, though I haven't worked out exactly how he converts it into a mating one.",
        "36... gxf5 37. Rxg8 fxe4 38. Rf5": "but this effectively stymied that hope.  The N has nowhere to go, so Black has to defend it with 38...Rh7, when it too has nowhere to go.  White can sweep up Black's errant pawn either by pulling the Rg8 back or swinging across with his K.  Recognising that I was lost, I resigned.  very well played by my 13-year-old opponent.\nPS My ECF grade is 124, his is 136.  I've been converting these to ELO by multiplying by 8 and adding 650.  I've been told by Paul Trewhela, also of Banbury, that I'm using the wrong conversion equation but I'm sticking to it for now as at least I'm being consistent."
