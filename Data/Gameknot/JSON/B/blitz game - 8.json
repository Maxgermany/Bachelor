        "2. Nf3 Nc6": "classic Sicilian",
        "3. Bc4 e5": "This isn't the regular move, I made this move to get more pressure on d4, for a knight outpost later, to free my DSB and to prevent white from playing Ng5 threatening a fork on f7",
        "4. d4": "this is probably a pawn sacrifice for quicker developing, when I take I'll have a greater pawn pressure on the center, but he'll have a slight developing advantage, it as well makes it possible for his N to move to the g5 square, something I missed in the game",
        "4... cxd4 5. Ng5 Nh6": "This is a weaker spot for the N but as white threatens Nf7 I have no other option except moving my queen, which I think would be weaker",

        "8. Na3": "developing his N, since Nf3 isn't possible, although I think that Nd2 would've been stronger",
        "8... Ng4 9. Bd5 Nb4": "My Ns now have 2 great outposts, I thought I could launch some attacks now, but i oversaw the following attack",
        "10. Bxb7 Bxb7 11. Qxg4": "I now lost a pawn, however, white has given his strong bisschop for a strong knight, we shall see what turned out the most valuable",
        "11... Qa5": "threatening Nc3 check",

        "14. Bd2": "pinning the N",

        "20... Ba6": "attacking the rook",
        "21. Rfd1 Be2": "infiltrating black's ranks, locking the rooks up on b1 and a1, because 22. Rc1 leads to 22. ... Bd2 23. Rb1",
        "22. Rdb1 Rfc8": "taking the important halfopen c-rank",
