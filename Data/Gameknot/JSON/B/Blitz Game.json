        "1. e4": "As usual, things are the same.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4": "Still in book, but we have the Guaco Piano, as opposed to, the Ruy Lopez.",
        "3... Nd4": "? But, this is where black starts to go wrong.  I'm not sure what black's best move was.  I would've continued with 3...Nf6, with the plan being to get my Bf8 into play and castle.  But, reversion said, \"(A known trap that intermediate players like to play sometimes - The main idea is a quick mate after 4.Nxe5 Qg5! 5.Nxf7? Qxg2 6.Rf1 Qxe4+ 7.Be2 Nf3#)\"",
        "4. Nxd4": "To paraphrase what he said here, the idea behind this move is because black will be forced to take back.  When he does, white will have doubled for no good reason, leaving white with a bigger advantage.",
        "4... exd4 5. Qh5": "?! \"(Threatening both Qxf7# and Qe5+ ->Qxd4)\"",
        "5... g6": "?? This loses right away. \"(Better was 5...Qe7, keeping both d4 and f7, although white is preferable, of course)\"",
        "6. Qe5+": "With that being said, white now takes advantage of black's weaknesses.  It starts here because when black gets out, white will win a free Rook, similar to what we see in the Domino's Defense.",
        "6... Qe7 7. Qxh8 Qxe4+": "Of course, black is hoping to get counterplay.",
        "8. Kd1 Qxg2": "So, he takes.",
        "9. Re1+": "But, the damage has been done.",
        "9... Ne7": "That's because this is where the puzzle starts, which I solved without any hints, as white has a forced mate here.",
        "10. Rxe7+ Kxe7 11. Qe5+ Kd8 12. Qf6+ Be7 13. Qh8+ Bf8 14. Qxf8#": "An important lesson to be learned here, is just like TA's Q sacs, you must be very careful with what you do in the opening.  In general, that's developing your pieces and controlling the center.  By failing to do that, black walked into the trap which white was able to exploit and force a win from there."
