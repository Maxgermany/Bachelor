    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "This was a painful loss. I get the better game. He does a sacrifice to get a perpetual and finds that he has a win, not a draw.",
        "1... c5": "It is also a work in progress, I will add in computer analysis at some point.",
        "2. Nc3": "He plays a closed Sicilian.",
        "2... Nc6": "So I just develop.",
        "3. g3": "I was expecting this. He has played this before this season in the 4NCL.",
        "3... e6": "I continue with the line that he lost to earlier in the season.",
        "4. Bg2": "He completes the finachetto.",
        "4... Nf6": "I develop my knight.",
        "5. f4": "He played Ng-e2 last time.",
        "5... d5": "So I advance in the centre.",
        "6. d3": "Perfectly playable although e4-e5 is more aggressive.",
        "6... d4": "So I advance again.",
        "7. Nce2": "Knight drops back.",
        "7... e5": "The pawn formation now looks a bit like a King's Indian Reversed, although white has already got f2-f4 in, which should be to white's advantage.",
        "8. Nf3": "He continues to develop.",
        "8... Bd6": "I need to protect e5 again.",
        "9. O-O": "He castles, and I have a long think. I considered 0-0 but I was a bit afraid of f4-f5 and a pawn storm against my castled king. After the game I discovered that I was right to fear this - f4-f5 scores well for white in the opening databases. Bg4, h6 , Qc7 and Ng4 have all also been played in this position, with varying degrees of success. What I played though seems to be relatively untried - at least in the opening databases I use.",
        "9... Bc7": "The idea is to play my bishop to a5, and develop it outside the pawn chain.",
        "10. h3": "A waiting move, but also perhaps supporting g3-g4 at some point and also stopping Nf6-g4.",
        "10... Nd7": "I re-enforce e5.",
        "11. Bd2": "He develops.",
        "11... Ba5": "I attempt to exchange off my bad bishop.",
        "12. Bc1": "And his bishop just drops back.",
        "12... f6": "Freeing up my knights, particularly the d7 one.",
        "13. fxe5": "He takes.",
        "13... Ndxe5": "I take back.",
        "14. Nf4": "Heading for d5.....",
        "14... O-O": "I thought it was safe enough to castle now.",
        "15. Nh2": "Not sure what the idea was here.",
        "15... c4": "I continue with my queen-side operations.",
        "16. Nf3": "And his knight comes back.",
        "16... b5": "I continue with my queen-side play.",
        "17. Nd5": "His knight reaches d5",
        "17... Be6": "I challenge it.",
        "18. Nxe5": "Perhaps I should not have allowed this - if I take back with my knight my d4 pawn goes, so I have to take back with a pawn. Ideally I would prefer a knight on e5, not a pawn.",
        "18... fxe5": "So I take back.",
        "19. dxc4": "He takes.",
        "19... bxc4": "I take back.",
        "20. Qe2": "He attacks c4.",
        "20... Rc8": "I indirectly protect it.",
        "21. Rxf8+": "He takes with check.",
        "21... Qxf8": "I take back.",
        "22. Bg5": "The bishop comes out.",
        "22... h6": "I attack the bishop.",
        "23. Rf1": "He attacks my queen.",
        "23... Qc5": "This may have been a mistake - on d6 my queen is able to defend the king-side better.",
        "24. Bxh6": "I thought this was unsound. After the game we were looking at d3+\n25.\tQe3\tQxe3+\n26.\tBxe3\tdxc2\n27.\tRc1\tNd4\n28.\tBxd4\texd4\n29.\tRxc2\td3\n30.\tRc1\td2\n31.\tRd1\tBxd5\n32.\texd5\tRe8\n33.\tBf3\twith a probable draw.",
        "24... gxh6": "But I took.",
        "25. Qh5": "With threats.",
        "25... Bxd5": "Thinking the game would end in perpetual check.",
        "26. Qg6+": "He checks.",
        "26... Kh8": "Forced!",
        "27. Qxh6+": "Check again.",
        "27... Kg8": "Forced again.",
        "28. Qg6+": "Check again.",
        "28... Kh8": "Forced again.",
        "29. Rf5": "Threatening mate.",
        "29... d3+": "I throw in a spite check, hoping for 30. Kf8?? Kf8 drawing.",
        "30. Kh2": "But he doesn't fall for that, and I resigned here."
