        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "This game was part of a Ruy Lopez theme tournament that I started.  I'm not usually a Ruy Lopez player (from either the white or black side), however there were some idea variations and pet lines that I wanted to experiment with, so I christened a seven-man tournament.  In my first game as white I'm paired with a strong 1800 player.",
        "3... Nd4": "?! The Bird's Variation of the Ruy Lopez.  Henry Edward Bird loved opening eccentricities like this.  Black moves his only developed piece, allowing it to be snapped off.  Frowned upon by classicists, but as with many offbeat lines, it does contain subtle poison.  I played against one Bird Ruy Lopez before and thought I had a good game since my opponent had isolated double center d-pawns, but my game crumbled grotesquely by move 20 when I tried to exploit them and unwittingly sprung my opponent's pieces (and two bishops) to life. I was determined not to repeat that mistake.",
        "4. Nxd4": "The most popular continuation, but 4. Bc4 also has its following, which I considered, but ultimately decided on the most forcing move.",
        "4... exd4 5. O-O a5": "?! A very queer move to my eyes, although even mainline Bird variations are strange by Ruy Lopez standards (5. ...h5!? has its adherents, for instance).  5. ...Bc5 is usual.  I figured 5. ...a5 was played with aspirations towards trapping my King's bishop with a Noah's Ark-esque maneuver if I was asleep at the wheel.",
        "6. f4": "Gaining space and central control.  My idea was to meet 6. ...c6 with 7. Be2, and then play d3, Ne2-f3, Qe1, and treat the position like a reversed Classical Dutch, perhaps challenging the d4 pawn with c3 at some point in the future, perhaps leaving it alone, depending on what black did.",
        "6... Bc5 7. Bc4": "Since black didn't play 6. ...c6, I moved my bishop to this more active diagonal and saved a tempo in advance.  I'm threatening 7. Bxf7ch and 8. Qh5ch as well.  I'm not concerned by the discovered check yet.",
        "7... Bb6": "?! I though 7. ...d6 was better, freeing his LSB while parrying my threat.",
        "8. d3 Ne7": "After 8. ...Nf6? 9. e5 embarrasses the knight back to g8.",
        "9. Qf3": "Developing my Queen to an active square in front of my rook on the f-file, and covering d5.",
        "9... c6": "A natural move, but slow.  Black wants to play ...d5 but his King is still in the center and his position is already precarious.    He should play 9. ...O-O and then possibly sac a pawn with 10. ...d5 to uncramp his position.",
        "10. f5": "! Now white will very strongly meet 10. ...d5 with 11. f6! dxc4 (...gxf6 12. Qxf6 Rf8 13. Bh6) 12. fxg7 Rg8 13. Qxf7ch Kd7 14. Bg5 and white is winning.",
        "10... Ng8": "The fact that black has to play this move proves that his opening has gone horribly wrong.",
        "11. Qh5": "!?  White has many good candidate moves here.  I considered both 11. e5 and 11. Qg3; both have merit and strictly speaking are more accurate.  I decided on his move because it basically forces black's reply and I could plan my follow-up with accuracy.",
        "11... d5": "11. ...Qe7? 12. Bg5 and 11. ...g6 12. fg fg 13. Qe5ch are the losing alternatives.",
        "12. Bg5": "Attacking development with tempo.",
        "12... Nf6": "12. ...Qd7 13. ed cd 14. Na3!, a strong piece sacrifice to mobilize the rest of white's army whilst black's army is entombed behind his king and queen.  14. ... dxc4 15. Rae1 Kf8 16. Nxc4, with many threats to the black position. The b6-bishop is hanging, the f6 push is threatened; something must give.",
        "13. Qh4": "Keeping the pressure and daring black to take my LSB and face an e5 push.",
        "13... dxc4 14. e5": "He does, and I follow through with e5, continuing my demolition operations on black's f6 point, preparing to open the e-file in my favor along with retaking my piece.  Quite a position has materalized on the board, looking more like a romantic King's Gambit game than a Ruy Lopez.  But they do call it \"Spanish Torture,\" as Nosferatu saw for himself 500 years ago with Torquemada.",
        "14... Qd5 15. exf6 gxf6": "? Black may not have liked it, but 15. ...O-O 16. fg Re8 would have minimized the damage (keeping the white g-pawn in his home intact is actually safer than capturing it and ushering white's DSB and queen in for the Coup de gr\u00e2ce).  The text is the losing move, although it's natural for black to want to fight back by opening to g-file to my own king.",
        "16. Bxf6 Rg8 17. Re1+ Kd7": "Or 17. ...Be6 18. Qh3, covering the mate threat so I can take the self-pinned bishop.",
        "18. Re7+ Kd6 19. Qf4+ Kc5 20. Re5": "As the black monarch is smoked out into the center of the board, the black's queen meets her death upon him.  'Til death do we part.",
        "20... Rxg2+": "The last bit of harassment white has to put up with.  Black can always hope for 21. Kh1??",
        "21. Kf1 Rxc2 22. Na3": "Tightening the screw and activating the remainder of my pieces, since the black queen isn't going anywhere.  Black resigns.  A good start for my tournament crosstable, as the Bird Defense drowns in blood."
