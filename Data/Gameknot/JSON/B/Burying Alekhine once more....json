        "3. d4": "It is too soon, for 3. c4 Nb6 4. c5 Nd5, although 5. Bc4 can give nice play... White should not let his pawns advance to far...",
        "3... d6": "Standard reply...",
        "4. Nf3": "Still, no c4; this might be a nice move in the future, for black, to worry about... This is the Flohr variation, my favourite method, of handling this...",
        "4... Bg4": "I would prefer Bf5, followed by Nc6, and Nb4, to deregulate whites play with an early attack on c2...",
        "5. Be2": "All very calm and solid...",
        "5... e6 6. c4": "This is the moment...",
        "6... Ne7": "A peculiar move... Also after 6. ... Nb6 - the best move - follows 7. exd6 cxd6 8. d5...",
        "7. exd6 Qxd6": "Forced, now... After cxd6, d5, Nd7 (or first exd5, cxd5), dxe6, black's position is quickly deteriorating...",
        "8. Nc3": "Just development...",
        "8... a6": "Loss of tempo, white is not considering Nb5... Better 8. ... Bxf3 9. Bxf3 Nbc6 10. Nb5 Qd7... Best is 8. ... Nf5, followed by Be7, and castling...",
        "9. Qb3": "Of course...",
        "9... b6": "Black cannot afford Qxb7 right now, without any real development... Bxf3 would have made things worse...",
        "10. O-O": "Still developing...",
        "10... Nbc6 11. Rd1": "The best way, to throw black off balance...",

        "12. h3": "Temporizing; 12. Qc2 Bf5 might give him any ideas... Though 13. Ne4 works fine... Notice, we are also robbing black from Nf5, after Bxf3, etc., due to g2-g4...\n",
        "12... Bh5": "Totally missing the point; there was still 12. ... Bf5, or 12. ... Bxf3 13. Bxf3 0-0-0...",
        "13. Qc2": "Go!",
        "13... Bg6 14. Ne4": "Contemplating Bf4, so 0-0-0 is in order... Or Rd8...",
        "14... Rd8": "Also 14. ... Qa5 might have given some comfort, after 15. Bd2 Qh5...",
        "15. a3": "Of course... This is the last reality check for black, after 15. ... Bxe4 16. Qxe4 Qa4, it might just hold...",
