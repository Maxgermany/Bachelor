The the black lsb should be better, in my opinion in b7, the the black knight can go to e4 (...Ne4, Bd3xNe4-d5xe4 and then the white position is quite bad wiht no way to move the rook to f3, which is one of the important lines.) But now if Bg4xNf3, it loose bishop just for a knight and help me developing.",
        "9... Bxf3 10. Rxf3": "may be better to retake with knight ? This was in order to move the rook to h colon.",
        "10... Nbd7 11. h3": "I'm playing with a ggod challenger, so  in this case i alway try to do something risky and aggressive, in order to give at least a little fun to my oponent\n",
        "11... Ne4": "Ne4? this is a bad black move, i dont understand it. It jus loose a pawn and will stay under the bishop threat (e4/a8 diagonal)",
        "12. Nxe4 dxe4 13. Bxe4": "black has to defend, white is quite well developped. Center is mine and strong. C5 cannot destroy it because  of e3 retake and keep occupying the space",

        "27. Kh2 Qxa4 28. Qe4": "this is the awfull BIG blunder i did on this game, i should loose my queen (Bd4 g1+...Qa4xQe4). I dont now wy, maybe duarte wanted to give me a chance ?",
        "28... Qd7": "defending the bishop, i can attak on h7 !",
