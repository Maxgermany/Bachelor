    "moves": {
        "1. d4 d5 2. h3": "Mmhh... I started to think that my opponent was a either newbie or wants to make a fool out of me.",
        "2... e6 3. a3": "The feeling grows stronger. I decided to continue because I have seen real good players \"making experiments\" in these blitz games. Anything for the fun, and I myself do try some unorthodox movements as well",
        "3... c5": "So I decided to go for a French-like defense, taking advantage of the poor development white is doing.",
        "4. Nf3 Nc6 5. dxc5": "Not common to accept on c5, it opens that flank for black to attack and also releases the Bbishop freely",
        "5... Bxc5 6. b4": "Attacks the bishop and creates a point of positioning his own WB very actively. But white still is hampered by his poor development.",
        "6... Bb6 7. Bb2 Nf6": "Sort of forced. You can feel some preassure now on the BK castling, and I started to feel uneasy here. But still, black seems to be positioning his pieces nicely.",
        "8. Nbd2": "Still seems that e3 is more important, but Nbd2 is also ok, since supports a future c4 or even e4.",
        "8... a6": "Maybe not needed now, but I didn\u00b4t like the perspective to lose that diagonal in case more pressure comes to my BB in b6.",
        "9. e3": "Now the mentioned c4 seems to be interesting. Even prepared with Rc1. Black has his chances on the queen\u00b4s flank, since it has an open \"c\" column, but white doesn\u00b4t seem to be that bad: no clear threats on the King\u00b4s side, yet.",
        "9... O-O": "Finishing development. Middle game now projects a confrontation on the queen flank, but I also  kept in mind that blacks bishops are aiming for the WB future castling.",
        "10. Bd3 e5": "So with that mentioned idea of trying something on the king\u00b4s side, I made the mistake to open too soon (didn\u00b4t see I was losing a pawn here, I must say). e5 was an interesting move after Re8 is played. But the moment I did the move I begun to think of possibilities to attack the center, since WK is still in his initial position.",
        "11. Nxe5": "Better taking with the N instead of the powerful bishop it seems...  White has not let me get away with this, so it is not that naive as the opening reflects.",
        "11... Nxe5 12. Bxe5 Re8": "But now look. If WB retires to c3 or back to b2, black can try to block the bishops with d4 (countered by e4, thus blocking B in d3) and then try to exploit the situation moving the rook to e6 and B in b6 to d7. Too many moves, I know, but an interesting plan anyways.",
        "13. Bxf6": "So white decided to exchange it for the N, that could support the attack on the castling, although at the same time, removes a piece that would interfere with a potential rook activity on 6 line.  Bg3 seemed to be a conservative but good idea.",
        "13... Qxf6": "Now the picture seems to be more than good for black, even with one pawn down. Check the potential sacrifice on h3 thanks to that initial pawn movement there. It will hurt white a lot.",
        "14. O-O Re5": "BQ doesn\u00b4t seem to be more active in a different square, so no need to remove it to allow the rook play on the 6th line, as planned before. True that Rook will not be as safe as in the 6th, but white cannot cover both g5 and h5 with N and B. BB sacrifice on h3 is pending but much more clear and menacing now.",
        "15. Nf3": "A logical defensive movement. The idea seems to be bringing N to h2 and then position the B in e2.",
        "15... Rh5 16. Be2": "Now, this is a grave but unclear mistake. I had thought of this while playing, and that\u00b4s why I did Rh5. But I didn\u00b4t see a more interesting defense for white: a direct 16.Nh2. Queen threats R in h5 and at the same time N can position in a place that will not interrupt B in e2 (if decided to go there). Black doesn\u00b4t have time to prepare Bc7 and Queen on mate position this way. Still black has a promising attack in case of 16.Nh2, but, after a light analysis, not that clear. Maybe 16...Rg5 can counteract Nh2, but nothing straight comes from that to me.",
        "16... Bc7": "Preparing the final assault as mentioned. Now threatening Qd6 or Bxh3.",
        "17. Qd4 Qd6": "Now the N in f3 is pinned.",
        "18. c4": "18.Qf4 seems to be a must here.",
        "18... Bxh3": "With the idea of ...Qg6 if not taken.",
        "19. c5": "Facilitating the threat. I case of gxh3 I\u00b4d say Rxh3 solves the game, threatening both Qg6+ and Rxf3 and mate in h2.",
        "19... Qg6 20. g3": "Didn\u00b4t see this, I must confess. But when you have your pieces in position, you have plenty of solutions to come out with.",
        "20... Bxg3": "Victory is ours!",
        "21. Bd3 Bh2+ 22. Kxh2 Qg2#": "A nice ending for a nice game. What started to seem like a boring game, ended up with an interesting position, and since I consider my rival did not do so bad in the middle game, when you have developmental problems at home, you don\u00b4t have too many options to come back. An instructive game to show the importance to finish your development properly (unless you have a good reason to do \"odd\" movements."
