        "6... g6 7. Nf3": "7. f4!? white transposes into the once feared four pawns attack. However, after the 7. ...Bg7 black has managed to neutralize all of white's responses. Having said that 7.f4 is the strongest test of black's knowledge and preparedness in benoni. \nAlternative variation: 7. f4 Bg7 8. Bb5+ (8. Nf3 O-O 9. Bd3 Re8 10. O-O c4 [=])8...

        "7... Bg7 8. h3": "This was one of white's first improvements in the developmental history of the Modern Benoni. White takes some time to prevent ...Bg4 which has led to some favorable lines for black in the past. The idea of ...Bg4 is that black will exchange his weak LSB for the critical knight on f3. The absence of the f3 knight makes e4-e5 much more difficult for white. \n",

        "9... b5": "!? This is black's most ambitious move against the modern main line. This idea is to deflect some of white's piece away from e4 and getting the chance to capture the important e-pawn.  From here on out it is black not white who dictates the direction of the game. \n",

        "14... Rxa2 15. Qb3": "With the open a-file and powerful queen side pawns the position is similar to favorable benko positions for black. The black pieces will pour through the queen side. \n",
