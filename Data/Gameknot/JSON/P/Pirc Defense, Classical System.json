        "1. e4 d6": "The Pirc Defense. Black invites White to play d4, where then he will try to break it apart by attacking it from a distance using tactical measures.",
        "2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3": "Here, White cannot play 3.e5? due to the response: 3....dxe5  4.dxe5   Qxd1   5.Kxd1   Ng4 (threatening the fork on f2, winning the rook) 6.Ke1   Nxe5 destroying Whites strong central pawns.",
        "3... g6 4. Nf3": "The Classical System. Whites best response to the Pirc. Also playable for White here is 4.f4 followed by 5.Nf3 (Austrian Attack), or 4.Bg5 (Byrne Variation).",
        "4... Bg7 5. d5": "(?) Better for white here is 5.h3, followed by 6.Be3 and 7.e5",
        "5... a6": "This move prevents the pin after Black plays Nbd7, which is a necessary move for Black to backup the f6 Knight, and to help out at d5.",
        "6. Qd4": "(?) White bites down on steel! Starting his attack too prematurely, and paying the price as we shall see.",
        "6... O-O": "also playable here is 6...c5! and after 7.dxc5 e.p.  Nxc6! and Black is looking good!",
        "7. e5 dxe5 8. Nxe5 Ng4": "(!) Now we see why Whites move 6.Qd4? hurts so bad. His Knight on e5 is pinned,and Black threatens to win a piece.",
        "9. Bf4 Nd7 10. f3": "and now Black wins a piece!",
        "10... Ngxe5 11. Bxe5 Bxe5 12. Qe4 Re8 13. O-O-O Bg7 14. Bc4": "Aiming at the King!",
        "14... Kh8 15. h4 Nc5": "(!) an attack on the flank is best met by a counter attack on the center! Although usually this involves a pawn thrust to c5 or f5, one cannot fault Blacks play, winning a tempo and opening the h3-c8 diagonal for his Queens Bishop.",
        "16. Qe2 b5": "Black plans to win the d5 pawn, and does so with precise calculations.",
        "17. Bb3 Bb7 18. h5 b4": "Removing the first defender!",
        "19. Ne4 Nxb3+": "(!) Removing the second defender, doubling Whites pawns, and winning the d5 pawn all in one shot!",
        "20. axb3 Bxd5": "Mission accomplished!",
        "21. h6 Bf8 22. Ng5": "Exploiting the pinned Bishop on d5, and threatening to win Blacks Queen by 23.Nxf7   Kg8  24.Nxd8",
        "22... Kg8 23. c4 e6": "Black could have taken the pawn \"en passant\", but his play 23.e6 contains a powerful tactical threat!",
        "24. cxd5 exd5": "(?) Black miscalculates here. Although the discovered attack on the Queen is powerful, White could respond with 25.Qd2 holding the Knight on g5. Black should have played 24.Qxg5  immediately, followed by 25.exd5.",
        "25. Qd3": "(?) Fortunately for Black, White blunders here. Once again 25.Qd2 is better.",
        "25... Qxg5+ 26. Rd2": "(?) White is now falling apart, 26.Kb1 is preferred.",
        "26... Bxh6 27. Rhd1 c6": "Black secures his position, before beginning his winning attack.",
        "28. Qd4": "White looks for counter play controlling the dark squares.",
        "28... Qxg2": "Black wins another pawn, exploiting the pinned Rook on d2. White must be boiling. His move 26.Rd2? has come back to haunt him!",
        "29. f4 Qh3 30. Rf1 Re4": "(!) A powerful blow! White is now scrambling for his life!",
        "31. Qc5 Qxb3": "Another pawn bites the dust, Black applies winning pressure!",
        "32. Qxc6 Rc4+ 33. Qxc4 Qxc4+ 34. Rc2 Bxf4+ 35. Kb1 Qe4": "0-1 Here White resigns. Within the Pirc Defense lies many tactical ideas, and sac's. If White is not prepared he can be crushed.  annotated by D. Bissing"
