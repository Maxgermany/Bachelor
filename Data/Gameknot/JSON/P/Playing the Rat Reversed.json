    "moves": {
        "1. g3": "\n \nI thought I would try annotating one of my games as it has been a long while and I feel I have made progress since doing my last one. My biggest weakness in chess is in rushing my moves so I deliberately picked out an opponent who is playing 5 days per move, forcing me to slow down myself\u2026so here goes\u2026\n \n",
        "1... d5 2. d3 e5 3. Bg2 Nf6": "To avoid a lot of theory I have a tendency to play the same three moves whether I\u2019m playing black or white. It\u2019s called the Modern Defence but I prefer to call it the rat. The crux of the strategy here is one of non-engagement. I allow my opponent free rein in the center so number one there are few forcing variations (a good way to avoid a lot of theory) , and two\u2026I\u2019m hopefully giving my opponent all the rope he needs to hang himself. I call this opening or system of development, \u2018the Rat Reversed.\u2019",
        "4. Nd2 Nc6": "In learning this system I took numerous beatings until I learned the importance of over-protecting e4 (as white, e5 when playing black). You can see this strategy here, as I have already protected my e4 square three times",
        "5. a3 Bc5": "A somewhat innocuous move at first blush (I often play c3 here as well), but later on, this move will set up an offensive thrust on the queen-side. Meanwhile my opponent continues to develop in classical style. \n \n",
        "6. e3 Bg4": "Black attacks my queen, while developing another piece. You will notice that when you play this system you will come under attack early and often but with experience you will find that this system of development has a lot of hidden resources that go unnoticed if you don\u2019t pay attention.",
        "7. Ne2 O-O": "This is an instructive position. Black has fully developed all his pieces while white appears to be cramped and on the defensive. But taking control of the center uncontested entails the responsibility of maintaining it. I\u2019m about to launch a counter-attack.",
        "8. h3 Bh5": "A forcing move, his bishop has to retreat. B-h5 is probably not the best move here. This bishop can still be chased away with g4.\n \n",
        "9. b4 Bb6": "Another forcing move, his other bishop has to retreat as well. Meanwhile I\u2019m gaining space on the queen-side while threatening his knight on c6 if I decide to push this pawn again.",
        "10. Bb2 Re8": "The battlefield has undergone a dramatic shift since the \u2018instructive position\u2019 after Black castled on his 7th move. The strategy of this opening system is becoming clearer. I\u2019m going to attack his center from the flanks with my bishops. While playing this system (at my level of competition), I have noticed that my opponents have a tendency to push their center pawns prematurely up the board. When this happens I like to push my other center pawn up as well, locking up the center. This often gives my knights attractive squares in the center to occupy. Notice too I have not castled yet. By delaying castling my opponent will be uncertain where he should attack. If the center does get locked up, chances are I won\u2019t castle at all..\u2026My opponent continues to develop in the classical fashion. The pawn move, a6 was another possibility for Black, protecting the b5 square from my b pawn.",
        "11. g4 Bg6": "Another pawn move which makes Black move his Queen\u2019s bishop again. You can see I seem to be counter attacking on the wings while playing with a \u2018restricted center\u2019 in the middle of the board. My metallic kibitzer, Komodo 8 (infinite analysis) prefers c4 or 0-0. It\u2019s not that g4 is a bad move although maybe in retrospect I\u2019m overextending myself on the kingside while attacking on the queenside as well..... If I had to do it over again I think I would play c4 and keep my king-side pawns back for now in case I eventually did decide to castle.....After thinking about this awhile c4 was definitely the move to make, by playing g4, I chased his bishop to a square where he was attacking my e4 square (my whole strategy in this system is to over-protect this strategic square).....If I had played c4 instead, I would have been attacking his d5 square, weakening his hold on e4. The whole course of the game would have been changed. I would have expanded on the queen side instead of the other side of the board. Again the fault was in myself and not the opening system......or maybe I just should have just castled, chess can be a challenging game.",
        "12. Ng3 d4": "When Black moved his bishop to the g6 square on his last move, I noticed he was attacking my e4 square 4 times while I only had defended it three times. If your opponent manages to successfully occupy the e4 square its curtains for me. I have lived through this a number of times. That being the case I move my King\u2019s knight to g3 where it additionally provides cover for this strategically important square. When you overprotect e4, your opponent will often push the other center pawn up the board. KO still thinks I should castle\u2026..As expected my opponent pushes his queen pawn to d4. KO suggested h6 for Black, protecting the g5 square. I\u2019m sure his king\u2019s knight would have appreciated the gesture. ",
        "13. e4 Nd7": "I anticipated his pawn move to d5, so I move my pawn to e4, locking up the center. The resulting shift in the pawn structure shapes my strategy. I plan on making a king-side attack with my pawns supported by my knights while leaving my king in the center of the board...... KO prefers Q-e2, a developing move. N-c4 was another possibility, increasing my presence on the queenside. One thing to keep in mind about e4, it does lock in my king\u2019s bishop..... Black\u2019s knight move gives the base of his center pawn chain added protection in case I go for eventual pawn break on f4.",
        "14. Nf3 a6": "Now that the center is safely locked up I shifted my other knight over to the f3 square. I made this move quickly (actually I make all my moves quickly). KO had a bevy of other suggestions. He especially liked g5, and suggested h4, N-c4 and even o-o as well. But I had other ideas. This is the cost of moving too quickly and not taking all the nuances of the position in consideration. It\u2019s not that N-f3 was an especially bad move, but I passed up other moves without even considering them. I saw a move I liked and tried to justify it to myself, a good example of confirmation bias.....A good idea here is when you settle on a move you want to make, try inverting your line of thinking and see what\u2019s wrong with it. \n \nKO preferred a5 to Black\u2019s a6 response, challenging me on the queenside. \n",
        "15. h4 f6": "I decide to push the attack on the king-side. If I move this pawn again, his bishop will be trapped. Chess is as much as anything else, a psychological game. I want to give my opponent something to worry about and maybe frustrate him in the process. While nodding his head in approval, KO also suggests g5. I guess we\u2019re both thinking a king side attack..... He also likes B-c1, providing additional support for the pawn advance on the kingside while improving the bishop\u2019s effectiveness as well......\n\nBlack replies f6, providing an escape square for his bishop, while giving his g5 additional support. \n",
        "16. h5 Bf7": "I forge on ahead, forcing him to move his bishop. Once he does that I\u2019m looking at N-f5 with my knight occupying a nice hole close to his king\u2026Sure enough he retreats the bishop\u2026Not bad I suppose, but KO suggests B-h3. The bishop move was an interesting alternative; it gives the bishop more scope while strengthening my grip on the f5 square (a square that\u2019s in close proximity to the black king). He\u2019s a pretty sharp kid this KO.\n \nAnyway black is forced to move his bishop to f7.\n",
        "17. Nf5 Ne7": "Before replying right away I noticed that he could move his bishop to B-e6 attacking my g4 pawn. I thought about it\u2026It seemed to me if I could trade off my knight for his bishop, it would be a good exchange for me. If that bishop stays there it\u2019s going to hamper my attack. I\u2019d like to get rid of it. My knights are also getting in the way of my heavier pieces so getting rid of one of them seemed like a good idea. I ran through a few variations and they left me with a good attacking position so I went ahead and made the move\u2026..KO also likes g5 for me.....\n \nBlack shifts his knight on c6 to e7 to help defend his king-side\u2026maybe even force an exchange of my knight on f5\u2026KO had a nice reply for black in a5, challenging me on the queenside, giving me something to think about, than my attack on other side of the board. \n \n",
        "18. Nf3h4 Nf8": "I add support to my attacked knight, moving my other knight from f3 to h4, opening up some space for my queen and eventually my bishop as well. Notice too that after about 18 moves into the game, all the pieces and even the pawns are still on the board, a demonstration of the \u2018non-engagement\u2019 character of the rat. By avoiding direct contact with the enemy in the opening, variations become less important until the middlegame and even then there is more of an on emphasis on schematic thinking, piece placement and pattern recognition\u2026..KO preferred o-o (king safety) and N-d2 (re-positioning my own knight with an eye on the queenside). Looking back maybe N3-h4 cluttered up my kingside too much resulting in my pieces getting in each other\u2019s way. In retrospect, I think this was the first of a series of sub-par moves on my part while my opponent was strengthening his position.....\n \nMeanwhile Black moves his other knight over to f8 on the king side, to help in the defence of his king. It also now controls g6 so if I was to play h6 it would open up a hole for this knight. KO likes this move as well as the disruptive a5.\n \n",
        "19. Bc1 Ne6": "I move my queen\u2019s bishop to a more active square so he can take part in the storming of Black\u2019s barricades..\u2026KO also liked h6, pressing the attack.....\n \nBlack moves his knight on f8 to a more active position, eyeing the strategic f4 square. The intentions of his eighteenth move have now seeing the light of day, a karpovian repositioning of the knight to take advantage of some of the holes left by my advancing pawns on the kingside. KO also liked a5, (breaking up my pawns on the queenside) but not as much as the move that was played.\n",
        "20. Qf3 Rc8": "Time for my queen to get more involved in the assault, while adding additional cover for the f4 square\u2026or so I thought at the time. Looking back, this move spelled the beginning of the end for me......KO didn't consider this move in his top five suggestions, and is it my imagination or is my attack beginning to peter out here, funny how things look in retrospect...... KO likes R-b1, and in lieu of what happened on the queenside in the next couple of moves, it would have been a good idea. KO also likes B-d2, giving my b4 pawn more support..\u2026I made that queen move awful quickly. One thing I have to learn is to take more time in evaluating the position in front of me before I commit to making a move.....\n\nBlack counterattacks moving his queen\u2019s rook to c8, threatening a pawn break at c5 disrupting my queenside. Played through a few variations and things are getting troublesome\u2026KO pointed out that black had a number of promising replies\u2026both c5 and a5 break up my pawn structure on the queenside and with my king sitting in the middle of the board, black is actually outflanking me. \n \n",
        "21. Bd2 c5": "After much deliberation I decided to move my bishop to d2 to giving added support to my b4 pawn. My attack on the kingside seems to be fading fast. Black\u2019s last move has me worried. I can see what is coming on the queenside. Remarkably, all the pieces are still on the board. I think black has the initiative..... KO prefers h6, still trying to stir things up on the kingside. Nxe7+ and o-o are other ideas.....\n \nBlack plays c5 seeking to breakthrough on the queenside. I ran through several variations and they all looked dangerous for me. I have to be careful here. If Black breaks through on the queenside I have serious problems. KO endorses c5 as best. Another possibility is N-g5, attacking my queen. Black increases his advantage with every move.\n",
        "22. Bf1 cxb4": "I\u2019m flustered as I feel things slipping away. Chess is as much as anything else, a psychological game and I\u2019m cracking here. B-f1 wasn\u2019t the best move but I made it anyway\u2026..KO prefers Q-d1 and R-c1, both of which protect my vulnerable pawn on c2 which is the base of my pawn chain..... \n \nBlack captures my pawn on b4 and my queenside collapses. My c2 pawn is now wide open and waiting for black\u2019s rook to swoop down and gobble it up.\n \n",
        "23. Bxb4 Rxc2": "A reflex move, capturing the offending pawn but I\u2019m done for now. The queenside will determine the outcome. I stop checking in with KO as things are plainly lost. I don't think he thought much of my move.....\n \nBlack\u2019s rook sweeps down and takes out my backward pawn on c2\u2026The bombs are starting to burst and things are getting ugly. My demise is quick. Chess is not a good game to lose but in order to enjoy you have to learn how to lose.\n",
        "24. Nxe7+ Rxe7 25. Bxe7 Qxe7 26. Ng2 Qc5 27. Qd1 Qc3+": "I resigned......\n \nPostscript\u2026..\n \nI seemed to have lost the thread of this game around move 18 (N3-h4). Black was adjusting to the position on the board while I wasn\u2019t. I should have paid more attention to the queenside and the safety of my king..... \n \nFrankly I move too fast and always have. By moving too quickly I often fail to understand all of the nuances of the position on the board. I also have a tendency to get so hung up on a singular idea that I fail to consider alternative moves......\n \nThere has been a difference of opinion on using chess engines to analyze your games. I think it depends on what engine you\u2019re using and how you are using it. All of the engines are tactical monsters so I think you should try to analyze your games with an engine that puts more of an emphasis on positional play. Komodo has a reputation for that, so that\u2019s the engine I settled on. I\u2019ve read that both Shredder and Hiarcs have a strong positional bent as well. I also think you should let the engine analyze for awhile (10 minutes or more), especially for positions that have a lot of moves that rated close together). And I think you should also try to figure out why the engine settles on a particular move. This can help you learn the positional nuances that are involved in a position.......\n \nI will continue to use the Rat as my opening system of choice. It did its job but I didn\u2019t\u2026..And congrats to my opponent, imiodrag who took his time with each move and taught me an additional lesson in patience......\n \nAs for Komodo 8...you can go outside now and play with Stockfish...\n \n\n"
