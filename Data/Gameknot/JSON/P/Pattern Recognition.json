        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. f3 d5": "Rather an arcane opening, this, but that's not really the point of this posting \n",
        "4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7": "Some of you will discern a similarity with patterns associated with Alekhine's defence; White's big centre, and the Black king's knight way over on b6. ",
        "7. Be3 O-O 8. f4 Nc6 9. d5 Nb8": "Why did Black develop his knight just to have it driven back home? Clearly he hoped that inducing the d-pawn forward would be worth the two tempi expended to do so. \n",
        "10. a4 e5 11. a5": "Take a look at this. This hasn't to do with the 'pattern' I mentioned earlier - that will appear soon - but to examine a most peculiar position. Black seems to have lost a heck of a lot of time, and is like to lose more. But what had White achieved in the meantime? Not a whole heck of a lot: an aggressive stance, but no real threats. ",
        "11... exf4": "Black doesn't want to lose more time! ",
        "12. axb6 fxe3 13. Rxa7": "! Now, although this again isn't the topic of this posting. take a note of this move. This capture wins a rook. Taking with pawn instead would just be silly, achieving nothing. The Black a8-rook can not be defended, but if 14...Rxa7, 15.bxa7 and the pawn will promote. I have had this very motif crop up once in one of my own games. But here, Black has a counter-attack of his own, something very familiar to us...... ",
        "13... Qh4+": "! And now, White dare not try 14.Ke2 on account of 14...Qf2ch 15.Kd3 Nd7! 16.Rxa8 Ne5ch 17.Kd4 e2#! So White played... ",
        "14. g3 Bxc3+ 15. bxc3 Qxe4": "There you see it. A strange setting for this attack by Black - especially in view of 15 moves having been played, and both sides having one wing undeveloped. ",
        "16. Nf3 Bg4": "The dear old knight pin pattern... ",
        "17. Rxa8 Bxf3": "So Black doesn't lose a whole rook after all. I'll append the rest of the game without much further comment. ",
        "18. Qd3 Qe5": "Not 18...Bxh1 19.Qxe5 Bxe5 20.bxc7 wins. \n",
        "19. bxc7": "?!",
        "19... Qxc7 20. Rg1 Qb6 21. g4": "?",
        "21... Rd8": "!",
        "22. Rg3 Rxd5": "Unconcerned about the knight. ",
        "23. Rxb8+ Kg7 24. Rxf3": "The Queen is a goner (familiar mating pattern of back rank mate with rook defended by the bishop - here the Black e-pawn supplies the bock to the f2-square), so White gathers what small change he can for it. \n",
        "24... Rxd3 25. Bxd3 Qc7": "! Stronger than the immediate R-B fork by 25...Qd6, as this will pick up a pawn as well. \n",
        "26. Re8 Qxc3+ 27. Kf1 Qxd3+ 28. Kg2 Qd2+ 29. Kg3 e2 30. Rfe3 Qe1+ 31. Kh3 Qf1+": "Black can't save the e-pawn in the long run, but can make its capture fraught with danger. ",
        "32. Kg3 Qg1+ 33. Kh3 Qf2": "! Black dare not take the e-pawn on account of this well-known mating pattern: 34.Rxe2 Qf3ch 35.Kh4 g5ch [A] 36.Kxg5 Qf6ch 37.Kh5 Qh6#, or [B] 36.Kh5 Qf6 and Black has no defence. ",
        "34. Re8e5 b5 35. g5 h5 36. Re5e4 b4 37. Re3xe2": "Possible at last. But... ",
        "37... Qf3+ 38. Kh4 b3 39. Re2e3 Qf2+ 40. Kh3 b2 41. Re4e8": "The situation has become so desperate, White tries for a 'swindle' - a stalemate try. He hopes for this: 41. Re8 b1=Q 42.Rg8ch Kxg8 43.Re8ch Kg7 44.Rg8ch Kxg8. There is no other way to escape the checks, but it's stalemate! I have had occasion myself on GK to save the draw by a double rook sacrifice in the end game. Here it doesn't work, though, as Black need not promote immediately... \n",
        "41... Qxe3+": "! This is a different kind of 'pattern' - 'sacrificing' material to crystallize out a winning situation. Black, in effect, wins the major exchange. \n\nWhite resigned at this point. \n"
