        "2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 e6": "looks like the beginning of the Ruy vs. the sicillian def.\r\n",
        "4. d4": "a little gambit.  white is looking to control the middle and begin king side attack while thwarting blacks queen side attack.",
        "4... cxd4 5. Nxd4": "current position is in whites favor. by both development and space controled.",
        "5... Nf6 6. Nc3 a6": "a passive move which does little for blacks development. this delay in developing his pieces will contribute greatly to blacks eventual demise.",
        "7. Be3": "white continues to develope his troops for combat.  focusing on king side attack and contrl of the center.   take note on bishops position.",

        "8. Bb3": "simple retreat still owning the diagonal",
        "8... Bb7": "an attack on the e4 pawn, black seems to want to take some claim to the middle.   Is it too late?",
        "9. f3": "f3 comes to e4 defence.  also limits the queen from  jumping into action right away.  she is not  needed till later although",
        "9... g6": "fianchetto the bishop this is due",
        "10. Qe2": "some might say why not Qd2 take out the black bishop.  not bad plan.  but  i had something else in mind. ",

        "14... O-O": "both kings have been casled to safety.  black seems to be more secure though.  \r\n    I must say that white has a younger king who sometimes likes to get into the mix.",
