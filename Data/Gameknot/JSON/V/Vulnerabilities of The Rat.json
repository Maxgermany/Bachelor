        "1. g3 d5": "My second game against my coworker. He opens with the Rat, a.k.a. Benko's Opening, which I know nothing about, so I follow the World DB with the most popular response. I find it interesting that every response except 1. ... g5 (played twice) and 1. ... f6 (played once) have statistics advantageous for white, some of them significantly so.",
        "2. Bg2 e5": "White follows through with his planned fianchetto and black creates the classical strong center.",
        "3. Nc3 Nf6": "And now white steps completely out of book with 3. Nc3. Sure, this is a fairly rare opening, but even so, this fairly natural looking move must have been tried before, somewhere? If it's not in book, maybe white just stepped into a well-known trap? In any case, I don't see anything wrong with the move. Maybe 3. ... d4 lets black chase the white knight, but since 4. Ne4 looks fairly strong for white, I don't see any advantage to be gained, so I leave it there and develop instead.",
        "4. d4 e4": "4. ... e4 pretty much puts the kabosh on white's fianchettoed bishop.",
        "5. f3 Bb4": "White wants to un-kabosh his bishop, and who can blame him. Black responds by taking white's knight out of the exchange equation.",
        "6. a3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 O-O 8. Bg5 Nbd7": "Defending the pinned knight. Not really necessary, and maybe 8. ... Re8 would have kept two defenders on the e5 pawn. But, I reasoned black wouldn't lose it for long.",
        "9. fxe4 dxe4 10. Bxe4 h6": "White's bishop on e5 is en prise. If the bishop on g5 retreats anywhere but h4 then black's knight is free to capture on e4, winning a bishop. If the g5 bishop retreats with 11. Bh4 then 11. ... g5 wins the trapped h4 bishop. White only has one move.",
        "11. Bxf6 Nxf6": "Now white must save his bishop.",
        "12. Qd3 Nxe4 13. Qxe4 Re8": "Dangerous play for white. The pawn on e2 is backward and awkward to defend on the open e-file.",
        "14. Qh4 Qd5": "14. Qh4?? was a mistake that will cost white at least a rook. Because of the pin on e2, white cannot simply play 15. Nf3 to block the attack by black's queen against the rook on h1. In fact, white has no way to save that rook. Note that white's vulnerability on the e-file and his vulnerability on the d5-h8 diagonal are both by-products of his first move. Sure, these vulnerabilities were exposed by later play, but it seems to me that a stronger opening choice such as 1. d4 or 1. e4 would have ruled out these two vulnerabilities right from the start.",
        "15. e4 Rxe4+": "White follows that error with 15. e4??? which loses the white queen free of charge.",
        "16. Ne2 Rxh4 17. Rg1 Rxh2": "Black captures the pawn on h2, but the pawn was not the objective. Getting a rook on black's 7th rank was the objective.",
        "18. Kd1 Qe4": "Multiple threats, and white must lose a knight at the very least. 19. Kc1 is probably white's best option here, though in this sense, \"best\" is that which lets him live only a few extra moves.",
        "19. Nf4 Bg4+": "19. ... Nf4??? gives up a 2-move checkmate.",
        "20. Kc1 Qxc2#": "Final position."
