        "1. e4": "at the beginning of the game my oponent was 100 ELO rating higher than me. i think it was around 1352~ for me 1480~ for him",
        "1... c5": "please comment on my style of opening with the sicilian. i know i do not follow the proper lines but we all learn as we go.",
        "2. c4 g6": "in games where white doesnt respond with Nf3 makes for my style to be easier. as i like to use the black bishop to defend e4  and i like to keep my d6 move to when the oponent moves out their black bishop.  please comment if this is bad :D im still learning much. and depending on if my oponents play d4 early i would rather they take dxc5 and open their middle if they are aggressive if not set up for king side attack is this good thinking?",
        "3. Nc3": "Nc3 makes e5 possible if not i would usually go Bg7 and then e5 to prevent the pawn push and to be able to take out my knight.",
        "3... e5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. b3 Nc6 6. Ba3 d6": "as stated earlier, i like to keep d6 for when enemy black bishop comes into play. my style of play leaves me Well open to the knight c7 attack it is important to castle quickly",
        "7. Be2 f5": "instead of Nf6 i thought my oponent was being very passive and was hoping to make the opening king side for my attacks.",
        "8. Rb1 Nf6 9. h3 fxe4 10. Ng1 h5 11. f3": "i loved this pawn move gave me 2 open slots king side for my attack",
        "11... exf3 12. Bxf3 Nd4 13. b4": "my attack was set here i could see the checkmate or the queen kill depending on if he falls for the Rook or the knight with his white bishop.\n",
        "13... Bf5": "force a move on his rook, stunt his attack right side. and set up trap for bishop leading to either mate or heavy losses.",
        "14. Rb2 O-O": "castle and leave the juicy pawn on b7 with Rook behind as intended.",
        "15. Bxb7": "success.",
        "15... Ne4": "crucial time if he bites on Rook Mate in 2, if not heavy losses including queen and i believe mate also in anycase",
        "16. Bxa8 Qh4+": "oponent gives up only 2 possible moves. 17 g3 Qxg3+ 18 Kf1 Qf2 mate\n\nplease comment.  trying to face higher elo rating oponents and having a decent winning streak as of this game (who knows in the future)"
