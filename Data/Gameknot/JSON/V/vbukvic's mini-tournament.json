        "5... Nc6": "Giving up a pawn for rapid development - nothing wrong with that.",
        "6. exd6 Bxd6 7. Nc3 Nf6": "A natural-looking move, and you probably played it without considering other options. But ask yourself \"On which side do I want to castle?\". I would suggest that the queenside is safer. So how about playing 7...Qh4. Not only does it enable you to castle next move, but it also attacks the weak pawns on h2 and f2.",
