        "5. Nxe5+ Kf8 6. Qh5": "He is going for the king. Not many moves to prevent and keep bishop and knight in play for further planning.",
        "6... Qe7": "The winning move perhaps. Whites king is on e-line and a fork on Ng6! If he goes for it. I may have material enough maybe even legs to finish him.",
        "7. Ng6+": "And it comes. If I take it my rook is history, but his queen will need at least 1 move to be back in action.",
        "7... hxg6": "So I go for it!",
        "8. Qxh8": "And he is falling just where I wanted him to fall.",
        "8... Qxe4+": "Here we go! Now it is a matter of how long will he last!?",
        "9. Kf1 Qd4": "Searching for mate in 1.",
        "10. Ke1 Qxf2+": "He is forced to move Kd1.",
        "11. Kd1 d6": "another opening. Still his queen in the corner. Can\ufffdt do much from there.",
        "12. h3": "He is doing all he can to stall.",
        "12... Qxg2": "Looks tough for white since he has so many undeveloped pieces and queen terribly misplaced.\n\nA better move is: Nd4 followed by Nc3, then See puzzle 48635. ",
        "13. Re1": "What can you do?",
        "13... Qf3+": "once again forcing him to play my way.",
        "14. Re2 Bf2": "Mate in 2 perhaps, but he will prolly struggle more.",
        "15. d3 Nd4": "Its close now...",
        "16. Nc3": "Any last wishes, before we close the store?",
        "16... Qh1+ 17. Kd2 Nf3#": "Unfortunately my opponent didn\ufffdt see it coming and still his queen nicely in the corner."
