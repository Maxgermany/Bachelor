        "1. e3 e5 2. Nc3": "My standard opening working only for the black,so I send out my knight, partly because I don't know what to do, and partly because to stop the procession of the king-side pawn.\n",
        "2... Nc6 3. Nf3": "I send out my knight for the castle I intend to do as fast as I can, and also because I might get a chance of getting that pawn after all.",
        "3... d6": "Ruined my hope for the pawn",
        "4. Bb5 Bd7 5. h3 a6 6. Be2": "Usually, I would have taken the knight for the e5 pawn, but seeing that it wasn't going to happen, I retreated to e2. This move locked me in for a short period of time.",
        "6... Bf5": "Just to mention, I am not bright at what enemy would do in long term. I just make it up as I go.( quite well, actually)",
        "7. O-O e4 8. Nd4 Nxd4 9. exd4 d5 10. Bg4 Nh6 11. Bxf5": "Thinking that there wasn't going to be another chance, I took the bishop. Now I also see that move freed my queen.",
        "11... Nxf5 12. d3 Nxd4 13. dxe4 Nb5 14. exd5 Nxc3 15. bxc3 g6": "I don't know why he made that move. please comment",
        "16. Re1+ Be7 17. Qd4": "I thought this was a good move, but now I see that I could have forced his queen with Bg5",
        "17... Kd7 18. Qe5 Re8 19. Qf4 Bd6": "I thought this was my chance, well, i just didn't see what was going to happen.",
        "20. Qxf7+ Qe7 21. Rxe7+ Rxe7": "Here, I got my answer for why he pushed queen, not the rook. If I don't take the rook e5, He would checkmate me.",
        "22. Qxe7+ Kxe7": "I believe it would have been better to take with a bishop, for then I couldn't have gotten the extra turn by checking him.",
        "23. Bg5+ Kd7 24. c4 Re8": "He couldn't have been dumb enough to go for a checkmate, but I still decided by moving Bishop to e3, I would be able to push the pawn to c5.",
        "25. Be3 h5": "Thank god for his sense of wasting turns.",
        "26. c5 Be5": "futile attempt for the rook.",
        "27. Rd1 h4 28. a4 a5 29. Kf1": "A move that came in handy after a while.",
        "29... Rg8": "why?, comment please.",
        "30. c3": "I forgot that I could push the pawn two places( how dumb!)",
        "30... g5 31. d6 cxd6": "He was dumb enough to take it, which led to his doom.",
        "32. cxd6 Bf4 33. Bxf4": "Did I mention that I love exchanges?",
        "33... gxf4 34. Rd4 Rf8 35. Ke2": "Thanks to previous move, I was able to move here.",
        "35... Rf6 36. c4 Rxd6 37. Rxf4 Kc6 38. Rxh4 Kc5 39. Re4 Rd4 40. Rxd4 Kxd4": "An exchange that was costly for black.",
        "41. Kf3 Kxc4": "He chose to take the pawn for a chance of queen.",
        "42. h4 b5 43. axb5": "He probably didn't expect the fact that he had to take that pawn.",
        "43... Kxb5 44. h5 a4 45. h6 a3 46. h7 Kb4": "realizing pawn push will bring his doom, he moves his king.",
        "47. h8=Q Kb3 48. g4 a2 49. g5 Kc2 50. g6 Kb1 51. Qc3": "He wanted me to push the pawn, which would have earned him a queen, but realizing that I would willingly take that pawn after his only possible move, pawn to a1, he resigned."
