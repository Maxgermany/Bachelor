        "2... Nf6 3. f4": "The idea behind this move (f4) is to open the f file, so after white's O-O, the Rook will be in a semi-open file, attacking the king's wing.\nAlso white threatens fxe5. \nexf4 is a BAD move for black, because white responds with e5 and the Knight is forced to move back.",
        "3... Nc6": "BAD move (you'll see why...)\nAccepted responses for black are d5 or d6",

        "7. Nf3": "This move protects the white king from Qh4",
        "7... Bb4 8. Bc4 Bxc3+": "Not a good move (in my opinion). Although the upcoming bxc3 will worsen White's pawn formation, the black-square white bishop gets better (he can move to b2 or c3).",
        "9. bxc3 d5 10. exd6 e.p. Qxd6 11. O-O Bg4": "This is a very BAD move for black that will cost a pawn. Actually this is the reason I annotated this game, because the same situation is very common in several other openings (including Italian).\n!! Always be careful when pinning the f-Knight (f3 for White, f6 for Black) against the Queen. The f2/f7 pawn is in danger !! \nTake a look at the following sequence:\nBxf7+  Kxf7\nKg5+   Ke1\nQxg4 \nWhite won a pawn",
        "12. Bxf7+ Kd8": "Black saw what will happen if he captures the bishop, so he decides to move away.\nStill the pawn is lost.\n(by the way, I think that Kd7 would be better - to leave access for the a8-Rook in e8)",
