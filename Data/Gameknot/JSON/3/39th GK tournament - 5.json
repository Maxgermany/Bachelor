        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 Bd6": "This is a terrible, inactive location for the Bishop. It blocks the d-pawn from advancing. d7-d6 would have been a reasonable way to protect the e-pawn because it is better to use pawns to protect pawns. If after 4... d6 5.Bxc6, then 5... bxc6 and White has given up the Bishop pair, and Black has good positional compensation with more pawns centrally located even thought the c-pawns would be stacked. It's a reasonable Ruy Lopez, exchange variation, opening.\r\nAlso, because White has protected his e-pawn with his d-pawn, Black, in using his Bishop to protect his e-pawn makes it much more difficult for him to deal with the pin that's created when White plays Bg5, and in this game, White exploits that weakness immediately.",
        "5. Bg5 O-O": "It's good to get castled early, but there was no imminent threat on the King,  so h6 might have been better here, working toward breaking the pin on the Knight on f6. After castling, if Black plays 6... h6, then 7.Bh4 g5 8.Nxg5 hxg5 9.Bxg5 with a good game for White because of the retained pin on the Knight and the exposed Black King.\r\nAnother possibility would have been a6, forcing the issue with White's Bishop on b5.",
        "6. O-O Nd4": "Unfortunately for Black, this move weakens his position even more. After the exchange, White gets to play f2-f4, adding another threat to the pinned Knight on f6. All is not lost yet, but Black needs to play carefully to avoid disaster.",
        "7. Nxd4": "White is happy to exchange the Knights, clearing paths for both his e and f-pawns. Black's pawn that ends up on d4 is a minor thorn in White's side, but Black will have to play carefully to keep control of the d4 square if that's what his goal is.",
        "7... exd4 8. f4 h6": "This is played too late, so it forces nothing. The pin could have been broken by playing Be7.\r\nAlso, the earlier Bd6 shows another weakness... when two pieces are on the same rank, and two files apart from each other (the Bishop on d6 and the Knight on f6 in this case), they are vulnerable to pawn advances that fork the two pieces. ",
        "9. Bh4 c6": "Black's Kingside was going to get opened up one way or the other, but this counterattack made it easier, and, because of the pin on the Knight, White will go up material in the process. Black still had Be7 available. He could have also tried Bxf4 (i.e. 9... Bxf4 10.Rxf4 g5 11.Bxg5 hxg5 12.Rf5 Nh2), but I think the loss of Kingside protection might have been too much for Black to have any long-term chances.",
        "10. e5 Bxe5 11. fxe5 cxb5 12. exf6 gxf6 13. Qg4+": "Now that there is a clear path to Black's King, and White has three pieces readily available, he will commence the attack. White's two pieces trained on the f6 pawn spell certain doom for Black. White will play Bxf6 on his next move, attacking Black's Queen and threatening mate with Qg7."
