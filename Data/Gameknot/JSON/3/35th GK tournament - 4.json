        "1. e4": "Here's a game I played in the first round of the Casual section in the 35th Tournament. I already had four points, and my opponent had two wins and no losses. So this game decided who passed to the next round, and it has a lot of pressure. I started with this common move.",
        "1... e6": "The French Defense. It requires a long and precise defense... If Black doesn't play accurately, White will soon have the initiative.",
        "2. d4": "White tries to claim the center.",
        "2... a5": "?? A bad move and an outright loss of tempo. Blunder.",
        "3. Nf3 h6": "? A prophilactic move,since it prevents Ng5, but with no sense of opportunity. Black should develop his pieces first.",
        "4. Bc4": "(?) The \" Italian\" development of the Bishop. I later realized this was a bad square for the clerk.",
        "4... d5": "! White necessarily loses tempo. This opening principle is valid in this situation : one should develop Knights before Bishops. This move would have lost his power with Nc3.",
        "5. exd5 exd5 6. Bd3 f6": "? A move that weakens Black's Kingside and stops ... 0-0 .",
        "7. O-O": "Natural.",

        "11. h3": "White doesn't want a minority attack on his rock.",
        "11... g6 12. Nh4": "Notice that this move is possible because Black's Kingside is full of holes.",
        "12... Bg7": "?? It would have been better Rg8, to defend the g-pawn.",
        "13. Nxg6": "The multiple pins start to pay off, because Black can't capture with ... Nxg6.",
        "13... Rh7 14. Nxe7": "!! A grand move. The second pin pays dividends, because Black can't recapture the Knight with his own Knight and won't trade his Queen for the Rook and the Knight.",
        "14... Bd7 15. Nc8+": "!! the move that forces the Queen to be traded for one Rook.",
        "15... Qe6 16. Rxe6+ Bxe6 17. Qe2 Rxc8 18. Qxe6+": "!!",
