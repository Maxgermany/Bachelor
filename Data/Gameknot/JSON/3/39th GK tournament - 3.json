        "1... e5": "I have played a couple 1600 players and they always seem to advance their pawns on me so I have to stop him from doing that, pretty normal.",
        "2. Bc4": "Just what I had expected, the old queen bishop mate.  Kind of an insult but i'm still cautious.",
        "2... Bc5": "I wanted to start the pressure on his weak pawn.",
        "3. Nc3 Nf6": "I wanted to attack his queen with my bishop soon, so just getting ready for that.",
        "4. d3 d6": "g4 is looking good a bishop attack seemed obvious so i wanted to change it up a bit.",
        "5. f4": "i'm already hating his pawns, but i just wanted to work around them.",
        "5... Ng4": "Here I was going to attack his queens bishop if he takes my bishop then I take with my knight and attack his queen. pretty strait forward.",
        "6. Nh3": "Here he gave me his knight.  i want to check him with my queen, if he blocks with g pawn then i take knight.  ",
        "6... Qh4+": "hoping to take a free knight.",
        "7. Kd2": "No give, so this is my favorite part of the game.  I knew that if I could get his feisty knight out of the way then I have mate shortly.  So i thought that i'd offer my knight for free because i'm only a \"1220\" player",
        "7... Nf2": "I had to wait two days to see if he takes or not......",
        "8. Nxf2": "Oh baby!!  I was going nuts at this point.  Do you see it???  ",
        "8... Qxf4+": "POW!  he resigned at this point.  I hate it when i get a resignation when mate is only a move away.  what a bitch but, whatever.  e2 or e1 only legal move fatal when my black beauty takes his Knight.    Upon resignation Decebals said that i played strong for my rating, I think that he didnt play strong enough for his.  Only in this game, he killed me on the next one.  Either way, I think that the moral of the story is, if your opponent underestimates you, make sure that he regrets it.  I received 19.4 points with this win."
