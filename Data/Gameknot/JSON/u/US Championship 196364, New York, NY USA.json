        "1... Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 c6 4. Bg2 d5 5. cxd5": "5.Qb3 maintains more tension. -- Fischer\n",
        "5... cxd5 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. e3 O-O 8. Nge2 Nc6 9. O-O b6 10. b3": "It's hard for either side to introduce an imbalance into this essentially symmetrical variation. Deadeye equality also ensues afer 10. Nf4 e6 11.b3 Ba6 12.Re1 Rc8 13.Ba3 Re8 14.Rc1 (Stahlberg-Flohr, Kemeri 1937) -- Fischer\n",
        "10... Ba6 11. Ba3": "After White's 11th move I should adjudicate his position as slightly superior, and at worst completely safe. To turn this into a mating position in eleven more moves is more witchcraft than chess! Quite honestly, I do not see the man who can stop Bobby at this time. -- K.F. Kirby, South African Chess Quarterly\n",
        "11... Re8 12. Qd2 e5": "! I was a bit worried about weakening my QP, but felt that the tremendous activity obtained by my minor pieces would permit White no time to exploit it. 12...e6 would probably lead to a draw. -- Fischer\n",
        "13. dxe5 Nxe5 14. Rfd1": "\"Add another to those melancholy case histories entitled: The Wrong Rook.\" -- Fischer ~ \"This is very much a case of 'the wrong rook'. One can understand Byrne's desire to break the pin on the e2-knight, but this turns out to be less important than other considerations. Fischer spends a lot of time and energy analysing the superior 14. Rad1!, but still comes to the conclusion that Black can keep the advantage.\" -- John Nunn\n",
        "14... Nd3": "Now it's all systems go for the Fischer rocket. -- Robert Wade\n",
        "15. Qc2": "There is hardly any other defense to the threat of ...Ne4. -- Fischer\n",
        "15... Nxf2": "The key to Black's previous play!  The complete justification for this sac does not become apparent until White resigns! --Fischer\n",
        "16. Kxf2 Ng4+ 17. Kg1 Nxe3 18. Qd2": "Byrne: As I sat pondering why Fischer would choose such a line, because it was so obviously lost for Black, there suddenly comes...\n",
        "18... Nxg2": "!! This dazzling move came as the shocker... the culminating combination is of such depth that, even at the very moment at which I resigned, both grandmasters who were commenting on the play for the spectators in a separate room believed I had a won game! -- Robert Byrne\n",
        "19. Kxg2 d4": "!\n",
        "20. Nxd4 Bb7+": "The King is at Black's mercy. -- Fischer\n",
        "21. Kf1": "In a room set aside for commentaries on the games in progress, two grandmasters were stating, for the benefit of the spectators, that Byrne had a won game. Byrne's reply to Fischer's next move must have been jaw dropping! -- Wade\n",
        "21... Qd7": "And White resign s. Fischer writes: \"A bitter disappointment. I'd hoped for 22.Qf2 Qh3+ 23.Kg1 Re1+!! 24.Rxe1 Bxd4 with mate to follow shortly.\"\n"
