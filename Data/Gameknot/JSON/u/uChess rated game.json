    "moves": {
        "1. e4 e5 2. c3": "?! This opening (the Ponziani, for those who care) is dubious because White is trying to build a big center but neglecting to develop the necessary pieces to support it. Nf3 is far more common, and Nc3, f4, d4 and even c4 or g3 are better as well. ",
        "2... b6": "?! Interesting. The queenside fianchetto (that is, playing \u2026b6 followed by \u2026Bb7) is fine in a vacuum, but it doesn't usually mix well with \u2026e5. \nAlso, White's last move was begging to be embarrassed with \u2026Nf6, which is basically a \"free\" move. You have to be on the lookout for those kinds of tempo-gaining moves in the opening!",
        "3. Nf3": "This move is fine, but what about d4? That was the point of 2. c3, no?",
        "3... Bb7": "I like how you attack White's pawn instead of stopping to defend your own \u2013 both are good plans, but your move shows ambition and commitment to your own plans.",
        "4. d3 Qf6": "?! Are we sure the Queen wants to be here? Why not develop the minor pieces first, and then see where the best place for the Queen is? (\u2026Nc6)",
        "5. Be2": "White should consider g3 and Bg2, although that is a bit slow.",
        "5... d6": "? There is no need to move this pawn at all. Develop your pieces!!!! \nAlso, this pawn may well want to move to d5 some time down the line. (In fact, it does do that, at move 13.) That makes \u2026d6 a wasted move, unless you had some important need for it to go to d6 first (you don't). On top of that, now the DSB (dark-squared Bishop) is locked in.",
        "6. Bg5": "! Developing with a gain of time on your exposed Queen.",
        "6... Qg6 7. Qd2": "? The Knight belongs here. White wants to trap your Queen, which is wishful thinking.",
        "7... h6": "! Good! Boot that Bishop!",
        "8. Nh4": "?? Oops. White made an understandable, but still awful, blunder here.",
        "8... Qxg5": "! Good, you saw it!",
        "9. Qxg5 hxg5 10. Nf5": "Alright, at this point Black is up a piece. White really doesn't have any compensation. This should be enough to win, no problem \u2013 if I were writing for experts, and felt lazy, I'd write,  \"the rest is a matter of technique.\" Of course, having a won game is not the same thing as winning it \u2013 let's see how you go about doing that.",
        "10... Nc6": "Good start. Black needs to develop pieces.",
        "11. Nd2 g6": "!? I like how you kick this Knight out so that you can finish development. That's high-level planning.",
        "12. Ng3 Nf6 13. a4": "? What is the point of this? For the next few moves, White just marks time with aggressive-looking moves and wait for you to make a mistake.",
        "13... d5": "? On one hand, there is some very good thinking behind this move \u2013 you're seizing more influence in the center and releasing your DSB. You're also rightfully ignoring White's pointless pawn pushes and doing your own thing.\nBefore you open the center like this, though, you really, really need to develop your pieces. That includes getting your King out of the center first, too. \u20260-0-0 is a must. ",
        "14. b4": "This has nothing to do with your play in the center, which is the central issue of the game right now. 0-0 or Rd1 are better.",
        "14... d4": "? Good, you're continuing to ignore the pawn pushes. This move is too impatient, though. \nIt looks like you're trying to open b4 or c5 for your DSB, which is admirable. Still, it would have been better to castle and keep the tension in the center. (Tension is a pretty advanced skill, but development is development.) ",
        "15. cxd4": "b4! is much better.",
        "15... Nxd4": "! Activating the Knight, and making lots of threats.",
        "16. O-O": "! Best.",
        "16... Bxb4": "Good for you \u2013 with some cooperation from your opponent, you got the square you wanted for the Bishop, and an extra pawn besides.",
        "17. Nc4 Nxe2+": "Tension again \u2013 it's not a big deal, and it's pretty advanced, but there's no need to rush this capture. (\u20260-0-0!)",
        "18. Nxe2 O-O-O": "At last!\n\nActually, \u2026Nd7 to guard the e-pawn was safer. Still, it all works out.",
        "19. Nxe5 Bd6": "!? I was going to say that you missed the fork on f7, but then I realized you had seen it, and seen further. This next tactical exchange is impressive on your part, showing potential far beyond your current rating. Still, it doesn't get a full '!' because the whole thing would be unnecessary if you'd just defended f7.",
        "20. Nxf7 Bxh2+ 21. Kh1 Be5+": "! Nice!",
        "22. Kg1 Bxa1 23. Rxa1 Rdf8": "Moving the other Rook would let you recapture on d8, which is a better square for the remaining Rook. A small, subtle thing to think about.",
        "24. Nxh8 Rxh8 25. Ng3 g4": "?! At this point, you start drifting a bit, until your opponent self-implodes and lets you off the hook. It's important to have a plan, even (especially?) when you've got a big advantage. I realize you were probably short of time, but planning will (in the long run) actually help you move better, faster. \nHere, a sample plan could be to try and create a passed pawn while exchanging pieces, and then push that passed pawn to the end of the board. \u2026Rd8, targeting the d-pawn, would be a good start, plus it'd win a pawn. (Rd1? Nxe4! 26. Nxe4 Bxe4 27. dxe4 Rxd1+ \u2013 using a pin) Once the d-pawn is out, the c-pawn can be pushed all the way.",
        "26. a5 b5": "It's good that you didn't break up your pawns with bxa5. Why bother with \u2026b5, though? There is no real threat from axb6, so \u2026Rd8 was again best.",
        "27. a6 Ba8 28. Rb1 c6": "?! You're voluntarily entombing your Bishop! Don't do that to your pieces!!!! \nEither defend in a more piece-friendly way (\u2026Bc6) or ignore the b-pawn and go after the much more important d-pawn with \u2026Rd8.",
        "29. d4": "! Now Black's Queenside is temporarily awkward. Not a fatal problem, but there was no need for it. ",
        "29... Kc7": "Good, making use of your King.",
        "30. d5": "? I get that White is trying to round up the b-pawn, but this move completely liquidates your cramp on the Queenside.",
        "30... cxd5 31. exd5 Bxd5": "! Showing the Bishop some long-overdue love.",
        "32. Rxb5 g5": "?! Back to the drifting. Where are you going with this?\n\nYou need to train yourself to always ask the question, \"what am I trying to accomplish?\" \nWith so many pawns traded off, now you need to go after some of White's pawns \u2013 which should be easy, with an extra piece to work with \u2013 to clear the way for one of your own.",
        "33. Nf5 Bc6 34. Rb1 g3": "? I'm guessing you missed that the Knight could take, but still, after fxg3, what have you accomplished? Your pawns are your path to victory in an endgame like this; don't squander them!",
        "35. Nxg3 Ng4": "Again, I don't see where this is going. How about activating your Rook, who's been out of the game for 17 moves now? (\u2026Rb8 or Rd8)",
        "36. f3 Ne3 37. Kf2 Nc4 38. Rc1 Ne5 39. Nf5": "?? Giving you a big opportunity, which you duly take advantage of. Had White not done this, the game could have continued indefinitely, unless you started playing much more intentionally.",
        "39... Nd3+": "! Bam! The long game has clearly not dulled your tactical vision. Good find!",
        "40. Ke3 Nxc1": "White should really be resigning here; now the win is easy.",
        "41. Ne7": "?? As happens so often, one bad move follows another.",
        "41... Re8": "!! Excellent! It'd be easy to get complacent after going a Rook and a Bishop up, but you stayed sharp and put him away with a judicious pin. Good game!\n(Your opponent missed it, but Kd2 would have made it more complicated. Still, White was totally lost to begin with and the resignation is overdue.)\nIt's fitting that, after you had ridden your tactical skills so hard to an overwhelming position, you would again finish off with a tactic. Thing is, your opponents won't always drop opportunities like this into your lap. You need to learn to \"make your own luck\" \u2013 to plan and strategize so that you are constantly improving your position on your own initiative instead of waiting for stronger opponents to beat you and for weaker opponents to fold."
