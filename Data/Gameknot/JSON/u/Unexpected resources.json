        "5. Nc3": "[%clk 0:04:42] A double edged move, more complicated than c3. Of course c4 was a possibility, but then I must have suffered from the B's dsb. No way. My aim with the text was c7. \n",

        "10... e5": "[%clk 0:04:51] Now I think that Retiring the B would have been the better option. White is solid and has space advantage on a closed board against the B pair. But I wanted to attack somewhere, and I risked...\n",
        "11. dxe6 e.p.": "[%clk 0:04:10] ...but this drops e4, fatally, unless I spend a tempo playing f3. It was a possibility, for sure, but I didn't want to need it. It was a mistake. \n",

Now, under the circumstances, which is the \"flaw\" I can find in black's position... if any?
