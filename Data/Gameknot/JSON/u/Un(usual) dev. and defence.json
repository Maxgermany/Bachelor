        "5... b6": "Fortunately, my opponent goes for other plan, very difficult to handle. ",
        "6. c3": "A weak move, but I didn't like c4 because of Bb4+ and what follows. This way I should expect no surprises on the queenside.",
        "6... Bb7 7. Nbd2": "Just in case BxN. ",
        "7... h6": "Black is taking good chances of the no-committement in the center. ",
        "8. h3": "h4 was another idea. ",
        "8... g5 9. Bh2": "I feared g4, here, where it is dangerous to uncover the h column for him. ",
        "9... Nc6": "Failing in pressure me a little more. ",
        "10. g4": "Stopping g4. I am aware I am opening the diagonal for his bishop. He can't take advantage of it right now: I can defend e5 without this N (in case of black's e5).",
        "10... Na5": "Uncovering the B threat, but abandoning the center. He is controlling c4, but that's ok!",
        "11. Rg1": "Unraveling my pieces is the most important task. ",
        "11... Ne4": "No panic. This N is doing nothing, here. ",
        "12. Ne5": "Not Be5?, f6. ",
        "12... d6 13. Nec4": "This N goes here, and now he is almost forced to exchange and free my pieces. ",
        "13... Nxc4 14. Nxc4": "Note that the white diagonal is controlled by black, but he is not able to materialize this in any way! This is a subtle form of defence that it is helpful, sometimes. I made this move to press on d6. ",
        "14... Qf6": "A strong reply, that puts me in a little trouble. Let's see...",
        "15. Qe2": "Blinding my B and inviting him to a pin, but threatening his N and at the same time defending f2. ",
        "15... Ba6": "It seems a good idea, at first, but it loses a piece, since my N is defended by the \"inactive\" Bf1. Nevertheless, he finds a nice fork if QxN, and thinks that it will work.",
        "16. Qxe4 d5": "The fork. Can you see white's only (and good) move?",
        "17. Qg2": "Yes. As cramped as they seem, white pieces are active. Black has lost a piece and it's is not easy to see compensation. ",
        "17... O-O-O": "? Another bad idea. I could accept the lsb's exchange, but this was nicer: ",
        "18. Nd6+ Bxd6 19. Bxa6+": "The hunter became the victim. ",
        "19... Kb8 20. Bxd6+": "Why not? A B pair against a B...",
        "20... Rxd6 21. Qg3": "Pin returned!",
        "21... Rhd8 22. O-O-O": "It's a matter of time, now. How would you break into the position?",
        "22... Ka8 23. Kb1": "Just to avoid a premature Q's exchange, just in case there is some combination before it. ",
        "23... Qe7 24. Rge1": "Pinned d5. A pity it is not threatened. ",
        "24... Qc7 25. Re3": "Looking to f3. ",
        "25... Rb8": "Black is slowly manouvering to trap my B. ",
        "26. Rf3": "I am manouvering too, and my plan is cruel. ",
        "26... b5": "Here he goes. Two moves from taking my B, but...",
        "27. Rxf7": "... he didn't expect this. It is not anything special. Just something you have to care about in such positions. ",
        "27... Qxf7 28. Qxd6": "Black was not lost, but his cramped K decides. A possible try for black was the following: ",
        "28... Rb6 29. Qd8+ Rb8 30. Qa5 Qd7 31. Re1 Rb6 32. Re3 Qc6 33. Rf3 Rxa6 34. Rf8+ Kb7 35. Rf7+ Kc8 36. Rc7+ Qxc7 37. Qxa6+ Kd8 38. Qxe6": "...and the endgame is won for white. Very interesiting game, despite the mistakes. "
