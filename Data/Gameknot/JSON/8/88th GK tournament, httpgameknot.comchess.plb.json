        "8... Ne7 9. e4 b6 10. Nf3 f6 11. Be3 Bb7 12. Bd3 b3": "b3 achieves nothing as after a3 the pawns are locked up. better was c5 attacking the centre and establishing a good pawn structure this is the 1st big step in the histogram in whites favour\n",
        "13. a3 Nbc6": "Na6 supports c5 and does not block the cpawn\n",
        "14. Rd1 Na5 15. Nd2": "c5 would further disrupt the K-side pawns. Nd2 is too passive\n",
        "15... Ke8": "meant to achieve what?? again c5 shouts out to be played\n",
        "16. Rc1 Bc6": "blocks the c-pawn. Ba6 would have prevented my c5. If i had seen the move of course\n",

        "20. f4 fxe4 21. Nxe4 exf4": "another big jump in whites favour. Puts whites dsb on a good diagonal supported by the R. Nf5 establishes a good forward position\n",
        "22. Bxf4 c6": "as commented on in the game. Ra7 is the best simple response.\n",
        "23. Nd6+ Kd8 24. Rd3 Ra7": "and now as so often happens in this cruel game. what was the best move a few moves ago now becomes the game losing move.\n",
        "25. Nb5+ Rd7": "trying to save 1 R ends up losing both\n",
