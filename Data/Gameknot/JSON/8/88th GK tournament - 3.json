        "1. c4": "This is from a rather short game, I would be interested in any comments.\n\nAs white I have been doing some experimenting with the English opening with varying degrees of success",
        "1... e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. Nf3 Nc6": "This is the first time I have been able to attempt the pawn fork ploy and as you will see it all went to plan",
        "4. Nxe5 Nxe5 5. d4 Bxd4 6. Qxd4 Nc6 7. Qe4+": "I wanted to see what black would do here, I was expecting Qe7 ",
        "7... Nge7": "I have my doubts about this move as black as it seems to block him in, although he can castle, what then? ",
        "8. Bg5": "I liked this move as it develops with tempo and if black castles I still have his knight pinned and am threatening Nd5 to pressure the e7 knight more",
        "8... O-O 9. e3": "Allows me to develop my lsb",
        "9... Re8": "I was expecting d6 here which would allow black to develop his lsb or even f6",
        "10. Bd3": "Black looks rather cramped to me he seems to be looking for a queen exchange but this move threatens Qxh7 which looks nasty for black",
        "10... g6": "I'm not clear what other options black had here - if any",
        "11. Qh4": "I was trying to work out how to break open the pawns around the black king, this looked like a reasonable start, combined with aiming to get my knight to f6",
        "11... h5": "I'm not sure that this was necessary, maybe black panicked as now I have the option of g4",
        "12. Nd5": "Heading for f6 and coincidentally threatening the black knight",
        "12... Nf5": "I was still expecting something like d6",
        "13. Bxf5": "Black resigned. \n\nThanks for reading please comment"
