Bb5 Nf6 4. d3": "it doesn't seam like a great move, but with Kasparov regretting not to have used it in 2000, and Kramnik classification of it as a dangerous move in his DVD, and having lost 4 consecutive games against it in 2005... I reserve my final opinion to after this game...",
        "4... Bc5": "I'll try to follow Kobalia-Bacrot, Aeroflot Open 2005, with no more than a draw for black, but were white was also not able to show much...",
        "5. c3": "I expected 0-0 without c3, but now I'll diverge from the previously mentioned game",
        "5... O-O 6. O-O d6 7. Nbd2 a5": "Not a novelty but a rare variation found only in Alaux-Nobili, France 1999, the idea is to get a7 for my knight or bishop (if needed, keeping an eye on f2 and indirectly white's king) while at the same time prevent b4, also allowing white's bishop to remain on b5 he might latter try to exchange it for my c6 knight...",
        "8. h3 Be6": "development, I had dubious feelings about this and Bd7... but eventualy I wanted to play Na7 and I preferred if white exchanged on e6 to open the f column for my rook",
        "9. b3 Na7 10. Bc4 Nc6 11. Bb5": "I could go for Na7 and allow a quick draw, but what was the point then to even start playing, to draw it after just a dozen moves?",
        "11... h6": "uncompromising wait to see move",
        "12. Bb2": "so, white wants to push d4...",
        "12... Ba7": "lets remove the bishop so he can't push d4 with tempo",
        "13. d4 Bd7": "now without Na7 available, let's defend the c knight and block the bishop x-ray attack on the e8 square... the exchange of bishops will most likely happen on d7 now",
        "14. a4": "?! dubious allows exd4 cxd4 Nb4 occupying an outpost on white's field ",
        "14... exd4": "invites cxd4 to remove the guard from b4",
        "15. cxd4": "...",
        "15... Nb4": "here it is",
        "16. Bxd7 Qxd7": "as planned...",
        "17. Bc3 d5": "challenging the center",
        "18. Bxb4 axb4": "doubles pawns but it might be possible to play b6 and c5 with a clear upgrade in my position",
        "19. Re1": "forced to act in the center, to prevent losing a pawn to the forced variation Nxe4 Nxe4 dxe4 N moves away Qxd4 loosing a pawn... white had three choices to push e5, to exchange exd5 or to protect e4, he chooses the last one",
        "19... dxe4 20. Nxe4 Nxe4 21. Rxe4": "massive exchanges to simplify the position... the probable outcome is a draw but there is still a lot to work for",
