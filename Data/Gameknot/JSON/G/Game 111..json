        "1. d4": "This marks game number 111 between my father and I. This simple typical thrust is the cornerstone to many of the games we play together.",
        "1... Nf6": "I don't care much for the Gruenfeld as black. I feel that The Nimzo Indian when met by Qc2 isn't all that much of an advantage for black. Also, I'm not comfortable with the Benoni lines. So this move marks the beginning of the the King's Indian defense for me.",
        "2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5": "The thematic e5 thrust.",
        "7. d5": "I don't see why my dad insists on playing this move as white because it allows black to stop c5 for quite some time. Thus, allowing me to attack as will be seen.",
        "7... Na6 8. a3 Nc5": "Stops b4 because of Ncxe4.",
        "9. Nd2 a5": "Stopping all queen side play.",
        "10. O-O Nfd7 11. f3": "?! I'm not sure this move is all that good for white here, as it closes out the light square bishop from the defense.",
        "11... f5 12. exf5 gxf5 13. Nb3": "Here I figured I would unwind with Nxb3 Qxb3 Nc5 Qc2.",
        "13... Nxb3 14. Qxb3 Nc5 15. Qc2 f4": "I wanted to close down the king side to keep the white pieces form being too intrusive.",
        "16. Ne4 Nxe4": "White must take back fxe4 because qxe4 Bf5 wins the queen.",
        "17. fxe4 Qh4": "Might have been better off locking up the queen side a bit more with b6.",
        "18. Bd2": "Planing on playing Bd1 and chasing the queen away.",
        "18... Bf6 19. c5 Rf7": "This move stops cxd6 cxd6 Qc7, and prepares Rg7 to begin the attack.",
        "20. Be1 Qh6 21. Bf3 Rg7 22. cxd6 cxd6 23. Kh1 Bd8": "Frees up the light square bishop. Also give the possibility of some activity for the dark square bishop Bb6. Black would have an interesting mating idea. Bb6 Rg6 Qxh2+ Kxh2 Rh6#.",
        "24. Bf2": "Stops Bb6.",
        "24... Bd7 25. Rac1 Be8 26. Qb3": "Puts pressure on b7.",
        "26... Qg5 27. Rc2 h5 28. a4": "! Plans a possible Qa3 and locks down blacks a8 rook.",
        "28... h4 29. h3": "Stops all king side operations.",
        "29... Qe7 30. Rfc1": "Here I kept thinking Rc8 was really good for white so I tried to stop it. Turns out that white doesn't gain much from it Rc8 Rxc8 Rxc8 Qd7 and now the black rook must retreat.",
        "30... Qd7": "?! There are better moves here but this move doesn't cause blacks downfall. I missed Bg4 here which makes this move look silly.",
        "31. Bg4 Rxg4": "The only move I could come up with that doesn't feel like I'm loosing too much.",
        "32. hxg4 Bg6 33. Rc2c4": "The best defense.",
        "33... Kh7": "?! Turns out this move doesn't do wonders to blacks game. I had planed to march up the h-file to take out the g4 pawn but it doesn't quite work because of whites next move.",
        "34. Qh3": "Wins the h4 pawn by force. The best move here would be black to play Kg7 and bite the bullet.",
        "34... Qe7": "?? Here everything looks all quite but white has a very devastating tactic",
        "35. Rc4c7": "!! and Blacks game goes down hill fast from here.",
        "35... Bxc7": "Not seeing the full threat here I accept the sacrifice thinking why not.",
        "36. Bxh4": "Forcing the queen to move. But what options does the queen have well g7, f7, e8, and d7. None of which look all that appealing but I choice the one of the worst ones. Black is already lost here though.",
        "36... Qd7": "Walks into forced mate :(",
        "37. Bf6+ Kg8": "Forced",
        "38. Qh8+ Kf7": "Forced again. Here I thought white would take the a8 rook but I didn't see the final blow.",
        "39. Qg7+ Ke8": "Forced and now.",
        "40. Qg8#": "It's all over."
