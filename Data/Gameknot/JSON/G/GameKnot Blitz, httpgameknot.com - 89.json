        "5. Ng5": "!",
        "5... Nh6 6. h3": "6.h4 calls to me: 6.h4 [a]6...Bd7 seems passive, but the aggressive line b only seems to lose time having to retreat the bishop [b]6...Bg4 7.f3 Bd7 [c]6...0-0 7.h5! [d]6...f6 7.Ne6!",
        "6... O-O 7. Be3 Qe7": "7...Bd7",
        "8. Qd2 Kh8": "Where else can the knight escape to? possibly 8...f5.",
        "9. Nc3 Be6": "? It's never fun when that was a mistake flashes through your head and it's about your own position.  Better to slow down!",
        "10. Nf3": "White hessitates when 10.Nxe6 fxe6 11.Bxh6 is winning.",
        "10... Ng8 11. a3 Bxc4 12. dxc4 c5 13. Nd5": "Black has to delay Nc3.",
        "13... Qd7 14. O-O f5": "! A thematic move but Nc3 is worth consideration as it helps control b4.",
        "15. Qd3": "! avoiding f4 with no escape square for the bishop.",
        "15... Nc6": "I am going to give a lazy assessment here: 15...fxe4 deserves consideration.",
        "16. exf5 Rxf5 17. Ng5": "There are two reasons this does not deserve an '!'.  The knight can be chased away, and white wasted time making this move twice.",
        "17... Raf8": "Bh6?",
        "18. c3": "Denying Nd4.",
        "18... h6": "Possibly too weakening but here the knight is too powerful eyeing f7, f3, h3, and h7.",
        "19. Ne4": "Avoiding 19.Nf3 Rxf3 when black gets a good attack as compensation.",
        "19... Nce7": "or g5",
        "20. b4 Nxd5 21. cxd5": "I think the Queen capture must be better.",
        "21... cxb4 22. axb4 Rf5f3": "Probably best is 22...g5.  While the move is losing (partly because it is played without g5 in preparation, as later analysis shows is needed, and partly because the sacrifice can be met with a rather simple knight move) the sacrifice was offered for almost no material compensation.  I have offered material before, but it is rarely so disconnected from material concerns.  This is a new evolution in my chess thought even though it may be a minor step up to what I already do and even though the plan connected with the move will fail when the move is played here.",
        "23. Rxa7": "A good move assuming he will see and respond to the black threats.",
        "23... Rxh3 24. gxh3": "? Probably best is Ng3 bringing some influence into the kingside.",
        "24... Rf3": "24...Qxh3 25.f4!",
        "25. Ra8": "White has serious issues that need addressing.  25.Ng3! (25...Qxh3 26.Qxg6! dismantles the black attack) 25...g5 26.Bxg5 (hoping for 26...hxg5 27.Nxg5 when the knight controls f7, h7, f3, and h3!) 26...Qxh3 27.Qe4 avoids the draw (27...Rxg3+ 28.fxg3 Qxg3 29.Qg2!) and seems to leave black with nothing for the rook sacrifice.",
        "25... Qxh3": "Building on the threat.",
        "26. Nxd6": "Once again Ng3, white was equal or better, but now white is lost to simple maneuvering.  Mate in 2.",
