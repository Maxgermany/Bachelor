        "1... Nf6 2. d5": "This can't possibly be common. It looks extremely weakening. Has anyone ever seen this?",
        "2... d6 3. c4 g6 4. Nc3 c6 5. Bg5 e5": "I'm trying to work around that pawn and if possible eliminate it.",
        "6. dxc6 bxc6 7. Bxf6 Qxf6 8. Ne4 Qd8": "White is, I think, slightly ahead on development, and this forced retreat is not welcome.",
        "9. Nf3 Bg4 10. Qd3 Bxf3 11. Qxf3 Bg7 12. Rd1 d5": "Both sides are trying to take advantage of the wide open space in the centre.",
        "13. cxd5 cxd5 14. Nc5 Nc6 15. Qxd5 Qxd5 16. Rxd5": "The queens are both gone and I am down by a pawn.",
        "16... Nb4 17. Rd2 Nxa2": "I recapture the pawn!",
        "18. e4 Nb4 19. Bb5+ Kf8": "I lose the right to castle...but the game has by now progressed so far that this hardly matters. What White's move has achieved is that his pieces can now harrass my king and make me lose tempi while he gains a foothold in my position.",
        "20. Nd7+ Ke7 21. O-O Rad8": "Aha! This looks good, pinning White's knight and building up attacks on it.",
        "22. Rfd1": "The only move...I think...",
        "22... a6 23. Ba4 Bh6": "At this point I offered a draw. Should White have accepted, given the position at THIS stage? At any rate, he didn't, and his refusal of the draw makes his next move even more heinous.",
        "24. Nxe5": "I give about 6 ?s to this move, for obvious reasons.",
        "24... Rxd2 25. Rxd2 Bxd2 26. f4 Bxf4": "Snap! Another one bites the dust!",
        "27. Nc4 Rc8 28. Nb6 Be3+": "This is the last straw for White, who resigned immediately."
