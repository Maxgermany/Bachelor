        "1. f4": "Thought I'd try something different. It seems interesting, controls the e5 square and allows the knight to be developed behind the pawn rather than in front. Sounds a bit like the philidor rationale haha.",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 g6": "I was a bit taken a back with the fianchetto, I presumed black would rather play an open game versus white's future cramped position, but what do I know?",
        "3. e3 Bg7 4. Be2 c5": "That's more like it",
        "5. d4": "Contest the center immediately. I don't want to be pushed back",
        "5... b6": "I was again confused with this move. I thought better would be 5. ... cxd4 6. exd4 Nc6 7. 0-0",
        "6. dxc5 bxc5 7. Bb5+": "A rather confusing move for black to respond to, in blitz anyways. Goes against intuition to not lose material if a few seconds are spent observing the situation.",
        "7... Bd7": "And there's the mistake. 7. ... Kf8 is the move.",
        "8. Qxd5 Bxb5 9. Qxa8": "Comfortable game shall ensue.",
        "9... Qa5+": "Another poor move by black, better is to play Qb6 to protect the knight and pawn. White can now just deflect the queen with Nc3 and also attacking the b5 bishop",
        "10. Nc3 Bxc3+ 11. bxc3 Qxc3+": "Qb6 is still preferential here. Black does bad to be greedy. I spent 30 seconds and decided to really bait black with the next couple of moves",
        "12. Bd2 Qxa1+": "Black saw the couple of rooks for grab, but forgets about his own horrendous defense.",
        "13. Kf2 Kf8 14. Qxb8+ Kg7 15. Rxa1": "Greed will get you, even 1700 players suffer from it."
