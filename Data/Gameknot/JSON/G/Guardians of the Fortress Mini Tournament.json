        "11... Bd7": "The alternative is 11..... Qe5 12. Bf4 Qf5  13. Qf5 Nf5 14. cd4 Nfd4 15, Nd4 Nd4 16. 0-0-0  Which i think favours white",
        "12. f4": "This transposes back to more normal line. Rh3 is an interesting alternative.",
        "12... dxc3 13. Qd3 O-O-O 14. Qxc3 Nf5 15. h5 Rg4 16. Qf3": "I'm not sure about this move as it takes the queen away from the d4 square. Maybe Rb1 is a better alternative",
        "16... Rdg8 17. h6": "Bb2 is  probably better. A complex position arises after 17......Nh4  18. Qd3 Ng2   19. Bg2 Rg2 20. 0-0-0 where white is probably slightly better because of the h6 pawn",
        "17... Ncd4 18. Nxd4": "This appears to be the decisive mistake, the only chance was 18 Qg4 Rg4 19. h7 Nc2  20. Kd2 Na1 21. h8(Q) Qd8. When black has a good ending but there is still some play in the position.",
        "18... Nxd4 19. Qh3 Nxc2+": "This is decisive, I dont think there is any possible defense now.",
        "20. Kf2 Qc5+ 21. Be3 Rxf4+ 22. Ke2 Nxe3": "This line is extremely sharp, I find that few people will play it against me in otb chess, probably because it is much easier to play the black position that the white one, and as we saw just a couple of small mistakes can quickly lead to a very difficult position"
