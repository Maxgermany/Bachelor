The f pawn looks like it will drop, I can't castle and none of my pieces are out. Although I am not sure how accurately white plays after this, I think this game could have easily gone either way.",

        "11... c5": "If I can trade queens I will be okay. Maybe. Neither of us have really developed so predicting how the game will go is very difficult.",
        "12. O-O": "? This invites Qxd4+ trading queens for the f pawn. Although white has counterplay, it does put a damper on his initiative for the knight.",
        "12... f3": "The pawn is poisoned. Can you see how? Note, I still have no pieces out. ",

        "17. Qxd4 Nc6": "e5 needs to be defended and Qg3+ does not seem to quite do the trick yet as there is no Rd8.",
