        "1. e4": "(Notes by GM Ray Keene.) Kramnik, the defending world champion, scored a brilliant victory in the 14th and final game; Peter Leko resigned after 41 moves when faced with checkmate. This is only the third time in the entire history of the World Championship that the defending champion has saved his title by winning in the final game. The game itself was a jewel of controlled aggression. Despite consistent exchanges throughout the game, Kramnik maintained an iron grip on the position and ultimately blasted his way into the black camp via the dark squares. Taking no account of material sacrifices it was Kramnik\u2019s king that dealt the fatal blow when it marched right into the heart of the opposing position. This outstanding game, the best of the match, recalled the classic fifth game won by Petrosian against Botvinnik in 1963 when a similarly epic king march in an endgame brought White a classic victory. \"I had to give everything, especially at the end, to win against such an opponent. Peter Leko is an incredible defender. For me it was more difficult than my match against Kasparov in the year 2000\", said Kramnik after the game. Leko said in conclusion: \"It was a very hard fight. In the end, it was not enough for me to win the title. I'm disappointed, but I'm looking forward to the future. I'm 25 years old, and I hope to get a new chance to become world champion.\" \n\n<Additional annotation by Steve Giddins>\n",
        "1... c6": "Leko is not averse to repeating the main lines of the Caro-Kann.\n",
        "2. d4 d5 3. e5": "By contrast, Kramnik must seek sharper paths. This move, favoured by Nimzowitsch, Tal and Short, is ideal for a must-win situation, since it locks pawn formations and avoids premature exchanges.\n",
        "3... Bf5 4. h4": "Nimzowitsch liked this 3 e5 variation and would play here 4 Bd3. His most famous game with this line is sadly a loss, a magnificent manoeuvring game against Capablanca from New York 1927. The most common alternative these days is 4 Nc3, as played for example by Kasparov in a drastic win over Karpov at Linares 2001, which continued 4...e6 5 g4 Bg6 6 Nge2 Ne7 7 Nf4 c5 8 dxc5 Nd7 9 h4 Nxe5 10 Bg2 h5 11 Qe2 N7c6 12 Nxg6 Nxg6 13 Bg5 Be7 14 gxh5 Nf8 15 Nb5 Nd7 16 h6. The latest try for Black is 4 Nc3 a5!? as in Sebag-Chiburdanidze, FIDE WCh Women KO, Elista 2004. Black won in 33 moves after 5 Be3 a4 6 a3 Qb6 7 Rb1 Qa5 8 g4 Bd7 9 Bg2 e6 10 Nge2 c5 11 0\u20130 Nc6 12 f4 h5. This 4 h4 line was tested repeatedly in the Tal-Botvinnik WCC match, Moscow 1961, with generally favourable results for Black. The paths they followed are retraced below.\n",
        "4... h6": "4...h5 may be preferable, after which Tal tried 5 Ne2 e6 6 Ng3 g6 7 Nxf5 gxf5 8 c4 c5 9 cxd5 Qxd5 but only drew their 14th game from 1961.\n",
        "5. g4": "Instead 5 Ne2 is possible and in their 20 th game 5 e6 6 Ng3 Ne7 7 Nc3 Nd7 8 Be3 Bh7 9 Bd3 Bxd3 10 cxd3 h5 led to a marathon struggle and another draw.\n",
        "5... Bd7": "It looks more natural to retreat the bishop along the b1-h7 diagonal, but, in that case, Black has to reckon with the dangerous pawn sac e5-e6.\n",
        "6. Nd2": "This looks like a new move. In the 10th Tal-Botvinnik game from 1961, we saw 6 h5 c5 7 c3 Nc6 8 Bh3 e6 9 Be3 Qb6 10 Qb3 cxd4 11 Qxb6 axb6 12 cxd4 Na5 and Black won in 42; while the 18 th game followed the course 6 c3 c5 7 Bg2 e6 8 Ne2 Bb5 9 Na3 Bxe2 10 Qxe2 cxd4 11 cxd4 Bxa3 12 bxa3 Nc6 and Black won again. However, Tal persisted with this line, and in Tal-Pachman, Bled 1961, he finally won after launching an attack following 7... e6 8 f4 Qb6 9 Nf3 Nc6 10 Na3 cxd4 11 cxd4 O-O-O 12 Nc2 Kb8 13 Bd3 Nge7 14 Rb1 Na5 15 Bd2 Rc8 16 b4.\n",
        "6... c5": "Black has one way to free himself before White's pawns begin to exert a fatal grip.\n",
        "7. dxc5 e6 8. Nb3 Bxc5": "A small combination that regains his pawn, but at the cost of trading his dark squared bishop. 9...Qc7 would doubtless transpose, but this is more forcing.\n",
        "9. Nxc5 Qa5+ 10. c3 Qxc5 11. Nf3 Ne7 12. Bd3 Nbc6 13. Be3 Qa5 14. Qd2": "The tone of play for the middlegame is set -- Black's position is resilient, but White has a promising future on the central dark squares. Fritz now wanted to try the line-opening gambit 14...d4!?, but no human player would yet regard such drastic measures as necessary. (It's a mark of how far computer programs have advanced that Fritz makes this dynamic choice.)\n",
        "14... Ng6 15. Bd4": "Accepting some exchanges, but White's dark square grip persists. In contrast, 15 Bxg6 gives black too much counterplay along the half-open f-file.\n",
        "15... Nxd4 16. cxd4 Qxd2+ 17. Kxd2": "<Giddins>This game is something of a parallel to Botvinnik-Bronstein (Game 23). Here, too, the world championship was at stake, in the decisive game of the match. This was the 14th and last game (barely over half the number played in 1951!), and Kramnik trailed by a point, so he too needed to win this game to save his world championship title. White has a small, but definite advantage, thanks to more space and the better bishop. However, the Black position  is very solid and has no real weaknesses, so it will not be easy to break him down.",
        "17... Nf4 18. Rac1": "From now on, White's play is direct and brutal. I would have played Bf1 and followed it with Ke3. Kramnik has no truck with such sophisticated nuances and goes directly for the jugular.\n\n<Giddins>18. Bf1 is perhaps the reflex move,but Kramnik did not like the reply 18 ...h5. Besides, he saw no reason to fear the exchange on d3 - it leaves White with the traditional knight versus bad bishop.",
        "18... h5": "And here I would have left Black's king's-side pawns severely alone and traded on d3. After 18...Nxd3 19 Kxd3 Ke7 20 Rc7 Rab8 followed by ...Rhc8, I believe Black could withstand the onslaught from White, though it must be admitted that White's knight will always be superior to Black's bishop.\n",
        "19. Rhg1": "19 g5 is possible instead, but Kramnik is all for open lines.\n\n<Giddins>There is no value in blocking up the kingside with 19. g5. Kramnik's move activates the rook on the potentially open g-file.",
        "19... Bc6": "<Giddins>19 ...Nh3 20. Rg3 Nxf2 is met by 21 gxh5 when Black can hardly defend the g-pawn.",
        "20. gxh5 Nxh5": "<Giddins>Structurally, White has acquired a weakness on the h-file, but on the other hand, the opening of lines on the kingside gives more dynamism to the position.",
        "21. b4 a6 22. a4": "An admirable display of energy, but, after 22...Bxa4 23 Rc7 Bb5 24 Rxb7 O-O, Black reduces the tension and gains counterplay. Taking the pawn could even be dangerous for White after 25 Bxb5 axb5 26 Rxb5 Ra2+. For this reason, I prefer 22 Ke3 restricting Black's knight, and if 22...O-O then 23 Rg5 g6 24 Rcg1 Ng7 25 h5! or if 24...Kh8 25 Bxg6! fxg6 26 Rxg6 Rf7 27 Ng5 and wins.\n\n<Giddins>White starts selzlng space on the other wing, classic two-front strategy.",
        "22... Kd8": "? Leko exhibits an alarming tendency towards a bunker mentality. After this passive move, Black is strangled in the style of his hero Petrosian or of Nimzowitsch, the arch-blockader and early prophet of 3 e5 against the Caro-Kann.\n\n<Giddins>Annotating the game in New in Chess 2004/8, Kramnik suggested that this natural move may in fact be the decisive mistake. 22 ...Bxa4 23. Rc7 is obviously bad, but Kramnik recommended 22 ...Ke7! 23. b5 axb5 24. axb5 Bd7 25. Rc7 b6 when he could find no direct win. Black intends to challenge the rook with ....Rhc8, and 26. Rb7 is nothing after 26 ..Rhb8. It is strange that allowing the rook into c7 should prove to be better than keeping it out, but it appears that this may be the case.",
        "23. Ng5": "This is the difference. The f7-square is now vulnerable.",
        "23... Be8 24. b5": "The point of White's play is to answer 24. ...axb5 with 25. Bxb5!. As we discussed in the context of PetrosianBannik,  bad bishops are often effective defenders of weaknesses, and the key to success frequently involves exchanging off the bad bishop, so as to expose the weaknesses. That is the case here. Once the bishop on e8 is removed, Black finds it harder to cover f7 satisfactorily. Kramnik gives, as a sample variation, the line 25 ...Rf8 26. Bxe8 Kxe8 27. Rc7 Rxa4 28. Rb1 Rxd4+ 29. Ke3 Kc4 30. Rcxb7 Rc3+ 31. Kd2 Rc8 32. Ra7 and White will double rooks on the seventh, with a mating attack. Note how in this line Black is so badly tied down to the defence of f7 once his bishop is gone.",
        "24... Nf4": "Clearing the a-file merely offers White a further avenue of attack after 24...axb5 25 axb5 Ra3 26 Ra1!\n",
        "25. b6": "Creating a terrible outpost on c7 for his rook. Black must prevent such an invasion at all costs.\n\n<Giddins>Now there is no way to prevent a rook invasion at c7, and Black's position is objectively lost.",
        "25... Nxd3 26. Kxd3 Rc8": "Black eliminates one enemy rook, but the other will replace it.",
        "27. Rxc8+ Kxc8 28. Rc1+ Bc6": "Black has plugged one path for White's forces but more soon open. Black, we soon see, is fatally debilitated on the central dark square complex.\n",
        "29. Nxf7 Rxh4 30. Nd6+ Kd8": "30 ...Kd7 allows the tactic 31. Nxb7 after which the white b-pawn will prove unstoppable.",
        "31. Rg1 Rh3+": "Passive defence is hopeless, so Black tries to clear off as many white pawns as he can. \n\n<Giddins>Passive defence by 31. ...Rh7 will inevitably lose, e.g. 32. a5 Ke7 33. Rg6 and White can prepare a breakthrough with f4-f5 at his leisure.",
        "32. Ke2 Ra3 33. Rxg7": "Kramnik pointed out that i f Black starts checking, the white king can march into the heart of Black's position, via f4-g5-f6 etc.",
        "33... Rxa4 34. f4": "!! The decisive coup. White's small but highly efficient army is ready to concentrate its powers and deal the death blow. If now 34...Rxd4, then 35 f5 exf5 36 e6 Re4+ 37 Nxe4 fxe4 38 Rc7, threatening Rxc6, and if 37...Bb5+, 38 Ke3 when Black's b-pawn is doomed and White's king penetrates.\n",
        "34... Ra2+": "34 ...Rxd4 35 f5 exf5 36. e6 threatens mate in one.",
        "35. Kf3 Ra3+ 36. Kg4 Rd3": "36 ...Ra1 leads to a lost rook and pawn endgame after 37. Nxb7+ Bxb7 38. Rxb7 Rg1+ 39. Kh5.",
        "37. f5": "The same theme. The way White's king now takes the Black fortress by storm with just rook and knight against rook and bishop reminds me strongly of the epic king march and superlative conclusion of game 5 from the Petrosian-Botvinnik WCC match, Moscow 1963.\n",
        "37... Rxd4+ 38. Kg5 exf5 39. Kf6 Rg4 40. Rc7 Rh4 41. Nf7+": "Black resigns since 41...Ke8 42 Rc8+ Kd7 43 Rd8 is 'mate. A jewel of a game and a sublime atonement for the sins of omission in some previous games of this match. Now compare the celebrated king march by Petrosian that doubtless provided inspiration for Kramnik as he conducted his final onslaught. \n\n<Giddins>A fine technical squeeze by Kramnik, played in conditions of enormous tension."
