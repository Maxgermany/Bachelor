    "moves": {
        "1. Nf3": "The Reti Opening (A.K.A. The Zukertort OPening. Though I have also heard it refered to as the King's Indian Attack), a very flexible opening, though one I play rarely because it lacks agression. Transpositions into the Queen's Gambit, Catalan, Ruy Lopez or many others are very common. But which one is more often determined by Black's play than by White's. ",
        "1... c5": "A variation of the Reti Opening, one that I've never seen before, but it looked like it would transpose into the Sicilian Defense.",
        "2. c3": "I aimed to get into an Alapin Sicilian, which is my favorite line in the Sicilian.",
        "2... Nc6 3. e4": "Reaching the Alapin Sicilian by a slightly different move order.",
        "3... e5": "This is setting up the Maroczy Bind (Pawns on e5 and c5, or e4 and c4 for White) a very strong set up for defense and stifling counter-play. But it also makes it hard to achieve active play, especially for the dark squared bishop. It makes for very slow play. Also this makes d4 difficult, the first of many moves in this game bent on controlling d4. It also makes playing d5 harder, which is a normal goal in the Sciilian.",
        "4. Bb5": "Setting up a potential pin on the knight and getting the bishop out of the pawn structure before I play d3 or c4. But d4, in order to open up the game immediately and then to develop bishops may have been better. Bc4, to attack f7 would have probably been better too. There's little shortage of better moves. There rarely is.",
        "4... h6": "Keeping the knight and bishop out of g5, but it makes a slight weakness on the kingside and wastes time. A developing move like Nf6 would have been better.",
        "5. d3": "Supporting my center and freeing my bishop, also good was to castle immediatly. Threatens 5. Bxc6 bxc6 6. Nxe5 as now 6...Qe7 no longer skewers the Knight and Pawn.",
        "5... Nf6": "A good developing move, but overlooking the threat of Bxc6 which wins a pawn.",
        "6. Bxc6": "Giving up a bishop for knight, which is not always good, and made worse by the fact that my Bishop was active and outside of my pawn structure. It does however win me a pawn. And it double his pawns, though this is not much of a weakness if they are used correctly. In this case they can be used to keep me from playing d4, and keep my pieces out of d5. Never let it be said doubled Pawns are always bad.",
        "6... dxc6": "Better is bxc6 despite the trapped Bishop, because it retains the possibility of a d5 break. And it would allow the Bishop to develope to a6.",
        "7. Nxe5": "Taking the pawn of course, but temporarily ceding the initiative. White now has a knight and a pawn for a bishop in a semi-open position, this is good but Black is not without counter-play.",
        "7... Be6": "I think Bd6 was a better move, to get the Knight out of his position as soon as possible. But now Qd6, 0-0-0 and c4 to pile up on the d pawn could be very good.",
        "8. O-O": "0-0 here is good, but f4 to take advantage of my opponent not kicking him out of there immediately is better, and to threaten to entrap the bishop with f5.",
        "8... Bd6": "Black's Bishops are definently poorly placed now, but atleast he can castle. I think this is really the only way for Black to gain counterplay.",
        "9. Nf3 Bg4 10. Re1": "? Readying e5 which I definently should've played now because of 10.e5 Bxe5 11.Qe1 Bxf3 12.Qxe5  Kf8 13.gxf3 Qxd3 14.Qxc5  Kg8 which wins two bishops and a pawn for a knight and two pawns. ",
        "10... Be5": "Stops e5 once and for all. And tries to protect d4, which is the key sqaure to control.\r\n",
        "11. h3": "Trying to break the pin on the knight, but allowing and kingisde weakness.",
        "11... Bxf3": "Best, in order to stop Nxe5.",
        "12. Qxf3": "?! Better than gxf3 which is weakening. 11...Bxf3 also allowed the Queen to come to her present square allowing a rook to go to her former square, adding a defender to d3 and a supporter to d4.",
        "12... O-O": "Castling away, I would have prefered Qd6 piling up on d3. ",
        "13. Rd1": "Be3 was better, much better. Had I played it I than could have proceeded with Na3 or Nd2 to get it to Nc4 after placing my rooks on the d file. And then doubled piled up on the d file with Red1 Rd2 and Rad1.",
        "13... Qd6 14. Be3 Rad8 15. Qe2": "? A bad move, unnescessary and slow, better was Na3 and Rd2 to bring the other rook into the battery. Na3 was better because Black was obviously not going to trade his Queen for my Rook.",
        "15... Rd7 16. Na3": "Finally developing the knight.",
        "16... Rfd8": "Finishing the battery.",
        "17. Nc4": "Forking bishop and queen, but more importantly getting the queen off the d-file.",
        "17... Qc7 18. Nxe5": "? Trading my good knight for his bishop was a mistake, Bxc5 was much better.",
        "18... Qxe5 19. f4": "?! Chasing the Queen out of the center, but towards my kingside. Rd2 and Rad1 were better.",
        "19... Qh5": "Not forcing a Queen trade but the prospect of his Queen so close to my king was unpleasant. As well his Queen was much more active than mine, so i think the trade was in my favor, except that it brought the knight closer to my position. That knight properly dealt with was no threat, but I didn't deal with it properly.",
        "20. Qxh5": "I thought the trade would favor me because of my extra pawn and his doubled pawns. I had not counted on the power of the Knight.",
        "20... Nxh5": "The Knight may be dim on the rim for know, but my Kingside is riddled with holes the Knight would love to dig himself into",
        "21. d4": "? Bxc5 is still better, I dont knot why i didn't play it.",
        "21... Ng3": "And so the knight eneters my position.",
        "22. e5": "That knight is a thorn in my side, and probably the best piece on the board.",
        "22... Nf5": "Attacking the Bishop but trading his knight for my bishop will only favor me.",
        "23. Kf2 Rd7d5": "I don't understand this move, cxd4 would've won the pawn.",
        "24. Rd2": "Trying to get another rook to defend the pawn.",
        "24... Nxe3": "? Trading his excellent knight for my worthless bishop, not good for him. cxd4 was still his best move.",
        "25. Kxe3 c4": "25...cxd4 26. cxd4 c5 was best for black, to get rid of his no longer so great doubled pawns. This gives up control of the d4 square, giving me an advantage.",
        "26. Rb1": "Preparing to move against the enemy c pawn. White's position here is much better.",
        "26... b6": "Readying c5, probably best.",
        "27. b3": "Attacking the enemy pawn, and trying to trade while up material and open up the b file for my rook.",
        "27... cxb3 28. axb3": "Now my pawn structure is excellent, I'm ready to start my pawns moving forward.",
        "28... b5": "Tries to stop c5 but it really doesn't hinder me very much after 29. c4 bxc4 30. bxc4 Rd7 or Ra5. And now I can also play Ra1.",
        "29. Ra1 Rd8d7": "?? Loses the rook to 29. c4 bxc4 30. bxc4 and the rook is trapped. This is the move that lost Black the game. Better obviously was 29...R5d7.",
        "30. c4 bxc4 31. bxc4 c5 32. cxd5 c4": "? This gives me two passed Pawns as opposed to one, cxd5 was better.",
        "33. Ke4": "Protecting al the pawns.",
        "33... g6": "Threatening 34...f5  which wins the e pawn.",
        "34. Rc2": "Threatening the c pawn.",
        "34... f5+": "Driving the King away form the e Pawn",
        "35. Kf3 Rxd5 36. Rxc4 a5 37. Rac1": "Threatening a mating attack.",
        "37... g5": "Trying to make space for his king to run to after Rc8  Kg7 39. Rc7#. Rd7 would have kept the king alive for a longer time, this however moves into a forced mate by 38. Rc8  Kg7 (Kf7 leads to the same thing) 39. Rc7  Kg6 40. Rg8  Kh5 41. g4  fxg4 42. hxg4  Kh4 and here Rc1 was best and mates the next turn, i played Rh8 instead which can allow Black to delay the mate. the end result is the same either way though.",
        "38. Rc4c8+ Kg7 39. Rc1c7+": "Bringing the second Rook in.",
        "39... Kg6": "Forced again. I suppose this is more of a king hunt than a true attack.",
        "40. Rg8+": "g4 also wins and if Black plays perfectly it wins quicker because of 40...fxg4  41.hxg4 Rxe5 42.Rg8  Kf6 43.fxe5  Ke6 44.Rg6  Kd5 45.Rd6#.",
        "40... Kh5 41. g4+ fxg4+": "41...Kh4 also loses to 42. Rh8.",
        "42. hxg4+ Kh4 43. Rh8": "43. Rc1 wins slightly quicker.",
        "43... Kh3": "43...gxh4 could have let him hold out another turn.",
        "44. Rxh6#": "Mate."
