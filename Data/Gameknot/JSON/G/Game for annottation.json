    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "Hope this game turns out interesting after me giving it that title !\r\n",
        "1... e6": "The French defence , which I most commonly use against 1.e4",
        "2. d3": "Unusual move here. Blocks in his own white squared bishop , but has me on relatively unknown ground already as far as this opening is concerned..but continue as normal I think",
        "2... d5": "Usual 2nd move for French defence",
        "3. Nd2": "More unusual opening moves ! Must be trying to get me onto unfamiliar ground for sure. Now both his bishops are blocked in though",
        "3... c5": "Again the standard 3rd move",
        "4. Ngf3 Nc6 5. a3 Qc7": "More commonly I would go to B6 with the Queen here , puttin pressure on the b2 pawn , but his bishop seems stuck on c1 for a while yet , so the long diagonal looks more useful",
        "6. c3 Nf6 7. h3": "Prevents me playin N-G4",
        "7... d4 8. Be2": "Bishop developed of sorts and clear for castling. Looking a bit cramped for white though . Lets see if it stays like that",
        "8... Bd6": "I liked the idea of Q B linked along this diagonal , also dont want his pawn to go to E5",
        "9. cxd4 cxd4 10. b4": "My pawn on d4 is looking weak I can support it with p-e5 , but that blocks my 2 pieces on the open diagonal",
        "10... a6": "Solely to prevent that pawn going one square further for now",
        "11. Rb1 b5": "Trying to block any more pawn advances Queenside",
        "12. O-O Bb7": "This now gives me both bishops acting together on long diagonals. Hopefully will become stronger once the centre opens up",
        "13. Re1 O-O 14. Bf1": "Now we see an unusual position for white with all those pieces on back rank !",
        "14... Rad8": "Indirectly lending support to advanced pawn",
        "15. Nb3": "Which he applies pressure to immediately !",
        "15... e5": "Not to keen on using this pawn to support pawn on D4 as it blocks the diagonal that my Queen and Bishop are on , but I think I have no other alternative",
        "16. Bg5": "Now starting to develop properly , and pins my Knight",
        "16... Be7": "Always best to deal with pins immediately I think",
        "17. Rc1": "Better square for his rook...controls the best open file available..and another pin!",
        "17... Qd6": "Which needs dealt with immediately ",
        "18. Rc2 h6 19. Nc5 Bc8": "Only move available to avoid losing pawn on a6",
        "20. Bh4 Nd7": "Knight on c5 and bishop on h4 are becoming too dangerous and need dealt with ",
        "21. Bxe7 Nxe7 22. Nxd7 Rxd7": "And that flurry of exchanges removes them both",
        "23. Be2 Rc7": "Now I have to challenge for the open file",
        "24. Nh4": "Dont think that really threatens anything at all",
        "24... Be6": "Got  my eye on Q R lined up on same diagonal , looking to skewer them",
        "25. Rxc7": "But exchange suits me fine",
        "25... Qxc7": "Should now be able to control the open file",
        "26. Bg4 Qd7 27. Bxe6 Qxe6 28. Qa1": "I dont understand why he moved here , seems a bit isolated",
        "28... Rc8": "Hoping to get Rook to c3 then back it up with Q on same file",
        "29. Rc1": "Challenging for the open file",
        "29... Qb3": "A quick threat to pawn on D3 and undermine his centre",
        "30. Nf3": "Doesnt protect it , instead choosing to attack my pawn on E5",
        "30... f6 31. Ne1": "Now he protects it",
        "31... Rc3": "Got there at last ! Now if he exchanges Rooks , I have a nice dangerous passed pawn",
        "32. Rxc3 dxc3": "Like that !",
        "33. Qc1 Nc6": "Aiming to go to D4 with knight next and cover the C2 square for a further pawn advance",
        "34. Nc2": "Which he blocks,,,dammit",
        "34... Nd4": "But it looks good for me to go ahead with my plan",
        "35. Na1": "Never mind the threat on my queen,, because he has overlooked.....",
        "35... Ne2+": "The fork ! If he moves king I take Queen , he can recapture mine but loses Knight in process and the pawn makes it to 8th rank...nice."
