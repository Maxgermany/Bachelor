        "1. e4 a6": "The St. George. Famously, Tony Miles beat Karpov at the peak of his considerable powers with this (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCW0TXH6e0g), but it's a bit much for a mere mortal like me to use as anything other than a surprise weapon.",
        "2. d4 b5 3. c4": "Most people prefer to develop a piece here (Karpov chose 3.Nf3), but this aggressive choice is also fine.",
        "3... e6": "Black gambits a pawn in return for rapid development.",
        "4. cxb5 axb5 5. Bxb5 Bb7 6. Nc3 Bb4 7. Bd3": "It seems that 7.f3 or 7.Qe2 have been preferred here, with reasonable success.",
        "7... f5": "This would be worth an exclamation mark if it were my own move, but not only has it been played before, but it is a standard idea in such positions. Black takes advantage of the weakness on g2 to increase the pressure on White. Black has scored very well in this position in practice.",
        "8. Qe2 Nf6 9. Bg5 fxe4 10. Bxe4 Nxe4": "This appears to lose a queen, but in fact White is so fragile at c3 and g2 that Black seems to be winning. Fritz is needed to confirm.",
        "11. Bxd8 Nxc3 12. bxc3": "The Spanish player Diego Piay Augusto preferred 12.Qh5+, but after 12...Kxd8 13.Qg5+ Kc8 14.Qxg7 Ne4+ 15.Ke2 Rf8, Black had more than enough for the queen and went on to win. However, the text move is inferior. ",
        "12... Bxc3+ 13. Kf1": "White resigns, possibly on seeing 13...Ba6. However, Black may be better advised to play 13...Bxa1. In either case, Black retains a comfortable advantage, though resignation is maybe a little premature here. "
