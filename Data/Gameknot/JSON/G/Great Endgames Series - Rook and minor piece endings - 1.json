Reg1 Be6 18. f4 Bd6 19. Bf2 Ng6 20. f5 Bxb3 21. axb3 Nf8 22. Bxb6 Bxh2 23. Rgh1 cxb6 24. Rxh2 b5 25. Re1 Nd7 26. Nd1 a5 27. Rh3 b4 28. Nf2 Nc5 29. Rhe3 a4 30. bxa4 Nxa4 31. e5 fxe5 32. Re3xe5 Reb8 33. Ne4 b3 34. Re2 Nb6 35. cxb3 Nd5 36. g4 h6 37. g5 hxg5 38. Nxg5 Nf6 39. Re5e7 Rxb3 40. Rg2 Nd5 41. Rd7": "Thus far, this game has been a rather tense affair, in which Black has objectively had the worst of it. The play was greatly affected by the tournament situation. Lasker was involved in a big battle with Capablanca for overall tournament victory. After a slow start, Lasker had found himself trailing the Cuban significantly, and in order to have any chance of catching him, he needed to win practically every game in the second half of the event. In the present game, he had therefore played in his typically provocative style, spurning straightforward equality in favour of stirring up complications, in the hope thereby of obtaining chances to outplay his opponent. We join the game just at the moment where Lasker's tactics have paid off, as White's last was a serious mistake which costs the exchange. However, that is only the start of the interest. ",
        "41... Rd3 42. Rxd5": "Surprisingly, this is forced. The threat was 42 ...Nc3+. Moving the rook away, e.g. 42. Rb7, allows 42. ...Rd1+ 43. Kc2 Ne3+ picking up the other rook, whilst 42. Kc1 walks into a snap mate after 42. ...Ra1+ 43. Kc2 Nb4 mate.",
        "42... Rxd5 43. Ne6": "Despite his extra exchange, Black's game is extremely difficult to win, as he is losing the g-pawn, with the result that there will be only one pawn apiece. Fine points out that with an extra exchange, the most difficulties in winning often arise with two rooks vs rook and knight, because the latter pair of pieces can cover all the entry squares and make it very difficult for the stronger side's king to penetrate. With so few pawns left as well, the difficulties in winning are at their greatest.",
        "43... Kf7 44. Rxg7+ Kf6 45. Rc7 Rd6": "Obviously, Black needs to hang onto his remaining pawn, at all costs.",
        "46. Nf4": "As Fine explains, so long as White retains his rook, there is little that Black can do, whereas once the rook comes off, the position is an easy win for Black. The latter's task is therefore to force the exchange of White's rook, which he does by a combination of mating threats and pins on the knight. With Alekhine defending stoutly, this proves a long process.",
        "46... Kxf5 47. Rf7+ Ke5 48. Kc2 Rh6 49. Nd3+ Kd6 50. Rf5 Rb8 51. Kc3 Kc7": "Black's king cannot really do anything active, because it is too vulnerable to checks, so instead it remains in\nthe background, out of the way, and also takes on the job of guarding the cpawn.",
        "52. Rf7+ Kb6 53. Rd7": "Preventing Black from ganging up on the knight with ...Rd8 and ...Rh3.",
        "53... Rh3 54. Rd4 Rbh8 55. Rb4+ Kc7 56. Kc2 Rh8h4 57. Rb3": "Now the rook has been forced into a rather awkward position.",
        "57... Rh3h2+": "Fine points out that 57 ... c5 was rather quicker: 58. Rc3 (58. Nxc5 Rc4+ 59. Kb1 Rhl+) 58. ...Kd6 59. Ra3 c4 60. Ra6+ Kd5 61. Nc1 Rh2+ 62. Kb1 Rh1 etc.",
        "58. Kc3 Rh4h3 59. Rb4 Rh3h5 60. Rg4 Rh2h3 61. Kc2 Rd5 62. Nf4 Rc5+": "62 ...Rd4?? 63. Ne6+ would be unfortunate!",
        "63. Kb1 Rh1+ 64. Ka2 Ra5+ 65. Kb3 Rb5+ 66. Kc3 Kb6": "For the moment, Lasker continues to manoeuvre and probe, without making any real progress. This is a natural part of the practical playing of such an ending. The pressure of the clock, among other things, means that such an approach is frequently inevitable.",
        "67. Nd3 Rh3 68. Kc2 Rd5 69. Rb4+": "69. Nf4 Rd4 would force the exchange of rooks at once, whilst 69. Nf2 Rh2 70. Rf4 Rg2 leaves White tied up.",
        "69... Kc7 70. Rb3 Rh2+": "70 ... c5 is again possible here.",
        "71. Kc3 Kd6 72. Ra3 Rg2 73. Ra1 Rg3 74. Rd1": "Now the knight is pinned both ways, and Black can start to activate his king.",
        "74... Kc7 75. Rd2 Kb6 76. Rd1 Kb5 77. Kc2": "Conceding further ground, but after 77. Rd2, Fine points out 77 ...Rc5+ 78. Kb3 Rcg5 and there is no defence against the exchange of rooks: 79. Kc3 Rg2 80. Rd1 Rg1 81. Rd2 R5g2 etc.",
        "77... Kc4 78. b3+ Kb5 79. Rd2 Rh3 80. Rd1 Rh2+ 81. Kc3 Rd8": "White is gradually running out of moves.",
        "82. Rg1 Rh3 83. Rd1 Rdh8": "Again threatening the rook exchange by ...Rh1 and ...R8h2.",
        "84. Rg1 Rh8h5 85. Kc2 Rd5 86. Rd1 Rg5 87. Rd2": "This loses at once. Fine analyses the toughest defence as 87. Rf1, after which he shows a win, as follows: 87 ...Rg2+ 88. Kc3 Rhh2 89. Rc1 c5 90. Nf4 Ra2 91. Nd3 Ra3! (now c4 is a threat) 92. Rb1 c4 93. Nc1 Kc5 94. Rb2 (the exchange of rooks is now tactically permissible, because Black's last pawn would fall, but Black himself can now avoid it) 94 ...Rh3+ 95. Kc2 c3 96. Rb1 Ra8! and there is no defence.",
        "87... Rhg3": "And finally there is no defence against the exchange of rooks.",
        "88. Nc1 Rg3g2 89. Ne2 Kb6": "A fascinating endgame, which illustrates the difficulties that can lie in the way of converting an extra exchange, especially with few pawns remaining on the board."
