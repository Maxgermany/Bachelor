        "1. d4": "this game was drawn against an opponent rated 1707.  black probably had winning chances with a vicious h-file attack.  but against tougher opposition, I was happy to settle for a draw.",
        "1... d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bf5 6. e3 e6 7. Bd3": "in rather dubious fashion, i retreated the bishop back to g6, where it was captured.  this doubled pawns but allowed me a semi-open h-file: thematic in london system games.",
        "7... Bg6 8. Bxg6 hxg6 9. O-O": "not fearing about the h-file pressure, he castles kingside.",
        "9... Bb4": "a possible inaccuracy.  the bishop could be a tactical target, and it is not doing anything very useful.  better would have been bd6.",
        "10. Ne5": "this move looks unpleasant, but i could not see any concrete threats.  i proceeded to simply exchange knights and relieve the pressure.",
        "10... Nbd7 11. Re1 Nxe5 12. dxe5 Ne4": "a strong move.  black was gained the initiative.  his c3 knight is under pressure and can't move without losing the exchange.  white is forced to defend.",
        "13. Bd2 Qh4": "the attack suddenly develops.  white must meet the threat of qxh2+, and also the menacing kxf2...",
        "14. Nxe4 Qxh2+ 15. Kf1 Qh1+ 16. Ke2 Qxg2": "perhaps qg4+ would have given black better winning chances...",
        "17. Bxb4 Qg4+ 18. f3 Rh2+ 19. Nf2 Qc4+ 20. Qd3 Qxb4 21. Reh1 Qxb2+ 22. Qd2 Qb5+ 23. Qd3 Qb2+ 24. Qd2": "and here a drawn was agreed upon.  had  i been playing more aggressively, i would have found a way to swing the rook to c8, which could have lead to some winning lines..."
