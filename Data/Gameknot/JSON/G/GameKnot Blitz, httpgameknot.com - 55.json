        "6. Bd3 cxd4 7. cxd4 Nbd7 8. O-O": "+- I like white's position better as he seems to have more opportunity, but the diagonal is a weakness that will need to be addressed in the future especially as pressure on d4 continues.",
        "8... O-O 9. Nb3 Re8": "Black is a bit cramped.",
        "10. e5": "?! Maybe I felt threatened or wanted to eat some of his clock. I don't think this move is necessary though.",
        "10... dxe5 11. dxe5 Nd5 12. e6": "!? blocks black's e pawn in.",

        "20... Nb6": "? Kxh7 is of course instant death. 20. ... Kxh7 21. Qh5+ Kg8 22. Qxg6 Kh8 23. Qh7#. 20. Nf6 is better as Nb6 allows me to do this...",
