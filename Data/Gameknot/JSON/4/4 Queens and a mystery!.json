    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "This is a fun game, where we both queen a pawn, and end up with 4 queens on the board. It is also a bit of a mystery. I lose, but the post-game computer analysis (PMCA) doesn't highlight any mistakes by me. So where did a go wrong? Read through with me dear reader, and see if you can help me find out where I went wrong!",
        "1... Nf6": "So it starts conventionally.",
        "2. c4": "I continue with the most popular move.",
        "2... e6": "This is very sound, indicating perhaps a Nimzo-Indian Defence or a Queen's Indian Defence.",
        "3. Nc3": "I elect for a Nimzo-Indian.",
        "3... Bb4": "Which she obliges with, rather than transpose back to the Queens Gambit declined with d7-d5.",
        "4. e3": "This is the main line.",
        "4... b6": "This is the more modern move, previously 0-0 was usually played here.",
        "5. Nge2": "So one knight supports the other. I stop her doubling my pawns. This is the Fischer variation, named after the only American World Chess Champion.",
        "5... c5": "She hits my centre.",
        "6. a3": "This is the obvious follow up to Nge2, now that she can't double my pawns.",
        "6... Ba5": "So the Bishop retreats.",
        "7. g3": "As my bishop can't go to e2 or d3, I plan to develop it on g2.",
        "7... Bb7": "But this stops my plan!",
        "8. d5": "This is virtually the only move. If she now takes on d5 I don't take back immediately, as she can just take on d5 as my Nc3 is not really protecting d5 as it is pinned against my king. Instead I would have played Bg2 first, before taking back on d5.",
        "8... b5": "So she doesn't take, but further undermines my centre.",
        "9. Bg2": "I need to develop and protect d5.",
        "9... bxc4": "And now my talented young opponent is a pawn up, but it is debatable whether or not she can hang on to it.",
        "10. O-O": "So I just castle.",
        "10... O-O": "And so does she.",
        "11. e4": "I further re-enforce d5.",
        "11... h6": "And she prevents an unpleasant pin on her knight with Bc1-g5. Up to here we are following moves in the Gameknot Opening Databases, but h6 appears to be a new move. maybe a reader with a bigger opening database can confirm or refute this?",
        "12. Rb1": "Now if she takes on c3 I can also take back with the pawn, and my rook will have a lovely open file.",
        "12... Re8": "She also mobilises a rook.",
        "13. d6": "I prevent her from supporting the c5 pawn with d7-d6, which is a good thing from my point of view. The disadvantage of this move is that it allows her to develop her Nb8 to c6.",
        "13... e5": "I have to be very careful now. If I am not careful, she will play Nb8-c6-d4 with an overwhelming position.",
        "14. Be3": "So I hit c5",
        "14... Bb6": "She protects it.",
        "15. f4": "Again, hitting one of the pawns which would support that knight if it ever got to d4.",
        "15... Nc6": "But the knight comes out anyway.",
        "16. fxe5": "So I take!",
        "16... Ng4": "She attacks my bishop",
        "17. Nd5": "I protect with my knight.",
        "17... Ncxe5": "She recaptures the pawn.",
        "18. Bf4": "In this open position, probably the bishops are better than the knights.",
        "18... Nd3": "But this knight floats deep into my position.",
        "19. Nec3": "I re-enforce my knight on d5, with my other knight.",
        "19... Nge5": "and she re-enforces the knight on d3 with her knight! Both sides' knights protecting each other in the centre of the board, next to each other, like this make an unusual configuration",
        "20. Qh5": "So I decide to probe the king side.",
        "20... Ba5": "Possibly she is going to start swapping her bishops for my knights?",
        "21. Bxe5": "OK stop! Black has two ways of recapturing on e5 - knight or rook. Which is best and why?",
        "21... Nxe5": "This way of course - she has to protect f7.",
        "22. Rf5": "So I hit e5 again.",
        "22... Bxc3": "Nicely timed by my lovely opponent! If I take e5, she can now recapture with the bishop. So I have to recapture the bishop.",
        "23. bxc3": "I'd love to say that I foresaw this when I played 12. Rb1 - but quite honestly I would be lying!",
        "23... Bxd5": "And now she removes the other half of my cavalry. My last move had discovered an attack on her bishop.",
        "24. Rxe5": "Rather than take back and double my pawns, I decide to get rid of her strong knight.",
        "24... Rxe5": "She takes my rook.",
        "25. Qxe5": "I take back.",
        "25... Be6": "She moves her bishop to safety. ",
        "26. Qxc5": "I recapture my pawn.",
        "26... Rb8": "She challenges my rook.",
        "27. Rxb8": "I take.",
        "27... Qxb8": "She takes back.",
        "28. Qb4": "I offer the exchange of queens. We now have a very level looking ending. Indeed PMCA gives this position as level. How she manages to turn this position into a winning position with just a few moves is almost a work of black magic! Where on earth did I go wrong?",
        "28... Qd8": "She avoids the queen exchange.",
        "29. Qb5": "I advance my queen.",
        "29... a6": "She attacks it. Now if I take the pawn, I was a bit afraid of Qb8 and her penetrating on the b file. I thought on c5 my queen could protect my weaknesses better.  Maybe just dropping it back to b4 was better. What do you think dear reader?\n",
        "30. Qc5": "So I went to c5",
        "30... Qb8": "She takes control of the b file.",
        "31. h3": "I give my king a flight square.",
        "31... Qb1+": "She throws in a check.",
        "32. Kh2": "King goes to safety.",
        "32... Qc2": "PMCA gives this move as a mistake by her, but I find that hard to believe! It says Qd3 was more accurate.",
        "33. Qa5": "So I protect c3",
        "33... Qd2": "She attacks d6.",
        "34. Qxa6": "So I take and protect it.",
        "34... Qxc3": "But she takes too.",
        "35. a4": "She can't stop my a pawn.",
        "35... Kh7": "Her king has to move off the bank rank at some stage.",
        "36. a5": "So I advance again.",
        "36... Qd2": "But I can't stop her c pawn.",
        "37. Qb6": "brigadecommander: looks like 4-QUEENS ON THE BOARD.",
        "37... c3": "charleshiggie: We could be heading that way - just like the famous match with Fischer and Petrosian. Do you know that game?",
        "38. a6": "brigadecommander: yes i do.Also a world championship game with ALEKHINE VS Capablanca had 4-queens.",
        "38... c2": "brigadecommander: this is the best game i have had in a long while. Just fun!!!",
        "39. a7": "brigadecommander: if i had not moved my king, the check would have not been good.",
        "39... c1=Q": "charleshiggie: yes indeed!",
        "40. a8=Q": "brigadecommander: Four 'ships of the line' on the battlefield.",
        "40... Qce1": "charleshiggie: lol",
        "41. e5": "brigadecommander: I wish i could consult Lord Nelson.",
        "41... Bf5": "charleshiggie: lol",
        "42. Qd5": "charleshiggie: I'm sure you are a much better player than him!",
        "42... Be4": "charleshiggie: Here is that Fischer game, if it helps... http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1106430",
        "43. Qxd2": "brigadecommander: thank you.Yes i looked it up on the same site.But i could not find the Alekhine/Capablanca one?",
        "43... Qxd2": "charleshiggie: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1270221",
        "44. Qg1": "charleshiggie: and now of course there is a 3rd.... you v me!",
        "44... Kg6": "brigadecommander: yes that's the one!! For a moment i thought it was just my imagination. I tried to find it but could not. Thanks. Ours is better!!!",
        "45. g4": "charleshiggie: Only one queen each - and I am struggling!",
        "45... Kg5": "By playing very accurately, black now has a winning advantage, proving that she is not just a pretty face. My problem is that she is about to exchange off to a won king and pawn ending.",
        "46. Qf1": "I temporarily stop her king advancing, but the truth is she has now got me right where she wants me. I can struggle and try to resist, but it is hopeless really.",
        "46... Qxg2+": "She takes.",
        "47. Qxg2": "I take back.",
        "47... Bxg2": "She takes again.",
        "48. Kxg2": "I take back.",
        "48... Kf4": "Now my pawns on e5 and d6 fall like ripe apples and I am just three pawns down. Against weaker opposition I may play on, but I knew she wouldn't mess up this position, so I resigned.\n\nMany thanks for reading!
