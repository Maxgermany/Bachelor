    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "In fairness a pretty standard game, with one tactic missed by both players. But as any good player will tell you, endgame knowledge can win you matches, or force draws you don't deserve. Not quite the case in this game, but does demonstrate how essential endgame knowledge is",
        "1... c6 2. e4": "Grabbing the centre",
        "2... d5": "Immediately contesting the centre",
        "3. exd5": "Not a fan of maintaining tension in the middle, I simply capture the pawn",
        "3... Qxd5": "More common is cxd5, since this avoids bringing the queen out too early, and as we see in this match the queen simply moves around before retreating having accomplished nothing.",
        "4. Nc3": "Natural development",
        "4... Qa5 5. Bd2": "Threatening future discovered attacks, but actually quite a weak move",
        "5... Qb6": "Attacking the now weakened b-pawn and d-pawn simultaneously, but easy to defend",
        "6. Bc1 Bf5": "Continuing development, but relatively better is Nf6, since we know the knight belongs there",
        "7. Nf3 Bg4": "A second move for the bishop, which could have been avoided if Nf6 had been played earlier. And really doesn't achieve much, as the pin is easy enough to break",
        "8. Be2 Bh5": "A third move for the bishop, and this time for no clear purpose. Again better is development of either of the knights",
        "9. O-O e6": "Releasing the BS bishop",
        "10. Rb1": "A quiet move, unpinning my BS bishop from protecting the b-pawn. Better perhaps would have been the more dynamic Ne4, aiming to prevent the black BS bishop sitting on d6, and able to defend the kingside if neccessary",
        "10... Bd6 11. Be3 Bxf3": "Zwischenzug, forcing me to capture his bishop, since d5 immediately allows Bxe2 Qxe2 Qd8, and black is a bishop up.",
        "12. Bxf3 Qc7": "Attacking the now weak h-pawn",
        "13. h3 Ne7 14. a3 Nd7 15. Qd2": "All a bit vague at the minute, neither of us taking steps into the middle to confront the other, just watching and waiting",
        "15... O-O 16. Rfe1 Rad8 17. b4 Nf5": "Looking to trade knight for bishop, as my bishop pair is the stronger force at the minute",
        "18. Ne4 b5 19. Nxd6 Qxd6 20. Rbc1": "Contemplating c4, to really open things up, and allow me to attack his backwards pawn on c6",
        "20... Nb6": "Preventing me from pushing the pawn fully",
        "21. c3 Nxe3 22. fxe3 Nc4": "A good move, taking advantage of my weakened pawn structure, and simultaneously attacking 2 backwards pawns",
        "23. Qa2": "Forced to protect the undefended one",
        "23... e5": "Continuing to play aggressively, probably hoping to expose my weak e3 pawn",
        "24. a4 a6 25. axb5 axb5": "The position is pretty even, since both of us have the minor piece attacking a weak pawn. However his queen is more central, and he is set to control the a-file with Ra8",
        "26. Be4": "Computer suggests Ra1 is better, preventing Ra8",
        "26... Rda8 27. Qf2 Rae8": "Threatening exd4, better would be f5 gaining space for his f8 rook and pushing my bishop off its current powerful square",
        "28. Qf3": "The only major blunder of the game, I had miscalculated the continuation after Nd2",
        "28... Nd2 29. Qg4": "Thinking I was safe against exd4. However\n29...exd4  30. exd4 Rxe4  31. Rxe4 f5  31.Qf4 Nxe4\nleaves black a knight up",
        "29... Nxe4": "Fortunately he didn't see this either",
        "30. Qxe4": "The simple recapture I had forseen",
        "30... exd4": "A discovered attack, but nothing threatening",
        "31. Qxd4 Qh6 32. c4": "At this point I look to exploit my well placed rooks on the queenside, and hopefully create a passed pawn",
        "32... bxc4 33. Rxc4 Qg6 34. Qc3": "Doubling the attack on the c6 pawn",
        "34... Rec8 35. b5": "Notice that the pawn is pinned, since taking on b5 allows Rxc8 and wins the rook because of the backrank mate",
        "35... h6": "Unable to protect the pawn, black settles for giving his king an escape square against backrank mates",
        "36. Rxc6 Rxc6 37. Qxc6": "Computer suggests that bxc6 is better here. This is because with only the rook to push the pawn forward it is easily blocked, and the black king is near enough to remove it.",
        "37... Qxc6 38. bxc6 Rc8 39. Rc1 Kf8": "The king now strolls across to the pawn, and we will be left with a 3 vs 3 pawns dead draw.",
        "40. e4 Ke7 41. Kf2": "I march my king towards the centre, looking to protect my pawn on e4, and look for weakness to exploit in the black pawn line",
        "41... Kd6 42. Kf3 Rxc6 43. Rxc6+ Kxc6": "I offered a draw to my opponent around this point, but it was rejected. So I set about forcing the draw quickly",
        "44. e5 Kd5 45. Kf4 Ke6 46. g4": "Marching all my pawns up to encourage quick exchanges",
        "46... g5+ 47. Ke4 f6 48. exf6": "Forced",
        "48... Kxf6": "At this point I predicted something along the lines of\n49. Kd5 Ke7  50. Ke5 Kf7  51. Kf5 Kg7  52. Ke6 Kg8  53. Ke7 Kg7  54. Ke6 Kg6\nWith the kings in opposition, and a swift draw agreed",
        "49. Kd5 Kg6": "Computer still says it a dead draw",
        "50. Ke5 h5": "Pretty much whatever I do, its a draw since:\n51. gxh5 Kxh5  52. Kf5 Kh4  53. Kg6\nAnd black either takes may pawn, and I take his. Or he moves the pawn forward and I capture it",
        "51. Ke6 Kg7 52. Kf5": "The position suddenly looks like it's in my favour, but it's still a draw. Something like\n52...hxg4  53. hxg4 Kh6  54. Kf6 Kh7  55. Kxg5 Kg7\nleaves the kings in opposition, and I can't push my pawn through against correct defense",
        "52... Kh6 53. Kf6 Kh7": "Still any move is a draw",
        "54. Kxg5": "But black suddenly thinks he is lost and resigns.\nThe continuation would be something like\n54...hxg4  55. hxg4 Kg7  56. Kh5 Kh7  57. g5 Kg7  58. g6 Kg8  59. Kh6 Kh8  60. g7  Kg8 Kg6 Draw\nThis is a good example of why even basic endgame knowledge can save a seemingly lost endgame."
