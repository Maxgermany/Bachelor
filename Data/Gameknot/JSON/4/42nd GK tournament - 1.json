        "5... Nf6 6. Bd3": "6. Nc3 would have been better, while this protects the pawn, develops the bishop, and prepares to castle, it also loses the central d5 square, which had previously been protected by the queen. 6. Nc3 would still have protected the pawn, as well as controlling d5.",
        "6... d5 7. exd5 Nxd5": "Taking with the queen would have been better here, as it would have prevented 8. Bb5",

        "29... Bxc5 30. Bxc5": "Perhaps 30. Bd2 would have been better, so that white would only lose one pawn.",
        "30... Rxf4+ 31. Kg1 Rxf5 32. Rd1 Rb5 33. Bf8 Rbxd5 34. Rxd5+": "White should never have traded rooks, now I am far enough ahead that I can't possibly lose.",
