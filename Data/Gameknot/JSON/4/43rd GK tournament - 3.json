        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e3": "You can be more adventurous here. 5.e4 is normal.",
        "5... b6 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. O-O d5 8. cxd5": "It's usually a good plan to remove your opponent's centre pawns if you can keep your own at the same time. Here, it gives more scope to his white-squared bishop, so Black is happy to exchange.",
        "8... Nxd5 9. Nxd5": "Not a good idea - you are giving up a developed piece, whereas Black is just replacing one developed piece by another. You could have played 9.e4.",
        "9... Qxd5 10. e4": "Having decided not to play 5.e4 it may now be better to leave the pawn on e3 to support d4.",
        "10... Qd7 11. Re1 Nc6": "Black is hoping to capture the d-pawn with his knight, rather than give up his strong bishop.",
        "12. Qa4 Rfd8 13. d5 Ne5 14. Qxd7 Rxd7 15. Bb5": "The simple Nxe5 is best.",
        "15... Nxf3+ 16. gxf3 Rd6 17. Rb1 a6 18. Bf1 c5": "Establishing a dangerous queenside pawn majority.",
        "19. Bg2": "I don't see the point of this move. After 19.dxc6 White should be able to hold on for a draw.",
        "19... e6 20. e5": "?? 20.dxe6 was necessary.",
        "20... Rxd5 21. f4 Rd7 22. Bxb7 Rxb7": "Black has an extra pawn and no weaknesses. The win should be fairly straightforward from here.",
        "23. Rd1 Kf8": "Centralising his king in preparation for an exchange of rooks.  Once the rooks are off the board, Black's task becomes easier.",
        "24. b4 c4 25. Bb2": "Presumably this was to prevent the further advance of the pawn, but it's too defensive. e3 is a much better square for the bishop.",
        "25... Bh6 26. Rd4 b5 27. a4": "Doesn't achieve anything. Rbd1 was the obvious move.",
        "27... Ke7 28. a5": "Centralising the king was a better plan.",
        "28... Rd8 29. Rxd8": "Forced.",
        "29... Kxd8 30. Rd1+": "White has better drawing chances if he keeps this rook on the board.",
        "30... Rd7 31. Rxd7+ Kxd7 32. Bc1": "A classic 'good bishop, bad bishop' position. All White's pawns are on the same colour squares as his bishop (bad). All Black's pawns are on different colour squares from his bishop (good).",
        "32... Kc6": "The Black king walks straight in without any opposition.",
        "33. Kg2": "Too late. The White king should already be on e4.",
        "33... Kd5 34. Kf1 Ke4": ""
