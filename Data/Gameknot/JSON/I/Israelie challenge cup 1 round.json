        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 d5 4. cxd5": "the idea was to take controll on the center with wining a tempo .",
        "4... Nxd5": "if 4...Qxd5 .5.Nc3 with e4 .",
        "5. e4 Nf6 6. Nc3": "good move , white develops his knight and on the same time defends his e4 pawn .",
        "6... Bg7 7. e5": "this move have some advantages and some dissadvantages , the advatange is that white takes space controll in the center and bolocks  blacks DSB on g7 . however white gives up the square d5 which all so allows the black knight to return to d5 . in positional game there are many times that , the players gives up some strong spots for getting another strong spots .",
        "7... Nd5 8. Bc4": "good move , white continue to develop his pieces to active positions , the idea of 8.Bc4 is to make pressure on d5 square ,and on the same time prerers 0-0 which give safety place for the white king .",
        "8... Nxc3": "maybe it was better for black to hold the central d5 square by 8...c6 ,  after the game my opponent told me that he didn't like the idea of 8...Be6 because of 9.Ng5 and probably he will lose his bishop pare , and will get double pawns on F file .",
        "9. bxc3 O-O 10. h3": "the idea of h3 is to avoid black a pine on f3 by Bg4 ,and by that 10.h3 is limit  blacks LSB moves and prepares 0-0.",
        "10... Nc6 11. O-O Bf5 12. Ba3": "i didn't see active positions on the c1-h6 diagonal for my DSB , therefore i developed my DSB to a3 which pines the e7 pawn and doesn't give black to close my LSB , however maybe , better was 13.a4 first , so if will be Na5 so i will able to move Ba2 and stay on the diagonal a2-g8 .",
        "12... Re8": "its a mistake , black loses a free pawn after 13.Qb3!which attacks f7with the help of the Bc4 and attacks the b7 pawn . 13..Na5 wont help because of 14.Bxf7+Kh8 and after the white queen retreats black will stay without material and with worse position .",
        "13. Qb3 e6 14. Qxb7 Na5 15. Qb5 c6 16. Qa4 Nxc4 17. Qxc4 Qb6 18. Rfe1": "with the move 18.Rfe1 there is a threat to win a free piece by 19.g4!-Bc2.20.Rac1!and the LSB is trapped.",
        "18... h5": "black saw the threat and plays 18...h5 to avoid g4.",
        "19. Bd6": "its not a bad move , however it was mutch better 19.Bc5-Qb7.20.a4 and white with big advantage .",
        "19... Bf8 20. Bxf8 Kxf8 21. Qb4+": "with free pawn advantage and my knight is much better than blacks bishop , i was looking for getting easy wining endgame .",
        "21... Kg8 22. Nd2": "i didn't hurry to exchange the queens right away , it was better for me to maneuver the knight to d6 (Nd2-c4-d6)and get very powerful position for my knight . and if 22...Qxb4-cxb4 and i have good pawn structure on my queen side , and leaving d4 pawn doesn't badder me because of the maneuver of my knight to d6 , as i earlier mentioned . if black wont tack the queen exchange offer and play 22...Qc7 , my queen will be in very strong position , controling the dark squarese diagonal a3-f8 and the B file and after 23.Nc4-Rfb8.24.Qa3! with very good position .",
        "22... Rab8 23. Qxb6 Rxb6 24. Nc4 Rbb8 25. Nd6 Red8 26. Re3": "the idea is to activet the rook and by the move 27. c4 play.28. Rb3. another idea was to avoid the blacks LSB come back to the game by ,Bd3-a6.",
        "26... Rb2 27. a4 Rdb8 28. a5 Rb2b1+ 29. Re1": "if 29.Rxb1-Rxb1+ , and it will diffieculte for me to defend the a5 pawn .",
        "29... Rxe1+ 30. Rxe1": "the diffrense here that after 30...Rb2 , i have the option to play .31.Ra1",
        "30... Rb2 31. Ra1 Rb3 32. Nc8": "good move if 32....Rxc3.33.Nxa7 , and it will be very hard for black to stop my (a) pawn .",
        "32... Rxc3 33. Nxa7 c5": "good move the idea is to play 33...Be4 , and some chances to create a passing pawn for black.",
        "34. Nc6 Be4 35. d5": "good move , after deep thught , i decided to give back my free pawn , for closing the h1-a8 diagonale .",
        "35... exd5": "if 35...Bxd5.36.Ne7+-Kf8.37.Nxd5 and , i will be quicker .",
        "36. a6 d4 37. Ne7+ Kf8 38. Nc8 Ba8 39. a7 Kg8": "because of clock problems , he started making moves for buying some more time .",

Nxc2- dxc2.51.Rxc4, and black cannot defend  longer his pawns , there for  he has nothing to do but to resign . black resigns . thank you i hope you enjoy my game ."
