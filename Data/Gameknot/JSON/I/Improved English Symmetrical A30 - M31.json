    "moves": {
        "1. c4": "I have been experimenting with the English opening against the computer lately to get a feel for how it plays.\n",
        "1... c5": "This is the particular branch that I am seeking for my experiments, the symmetrical version. Both players stake out control of a d file square on the opponents side of the board.\n",
        "2. Nf3": "With this move white plays against ...e5.\n",
        "2... Nf6": "Black follows with a similar plan.\n",
        "3. e3": "This move fights for d4, and guards c4, and activates the bishop so it can be developed in preperation for 0-0, and is meant to support the followup move of d2-d4.\n",
        "3... d5": "Black begins an immediate fight for d5, fully developing a second pawn in the fight for the center.\n",
        "4. cxd5": "Exchanging this pawn away makes sense so that black has less influence in the center, and to prevent suffocating pawn moves by black.\n",
        "4... Nxd5": "Material equality is maintained, but the knight will not be welcomed here by white.\n",
        "5. Bc4": "This is a great developing move for the bishop, it is the most active placement. There is no real threat against the knight without a second piece, but the move does influence the center and draws a line to f7.\n",
        "5... Be6": "This move is not really necessary because the queen has guard of the knight, but it does allow black to try a tactic of ...Nc3! where it attacks both queen and the loose bishop.\n",
        "6. b3": "This refutes the tactical idea.\n",
        "6... Bf5": "Black repositions the bishop to take control of c2, d3, e4 squares, but this position begs a fork.\n",
        "7. d3": "+/= Threatening an e3-e4 fork.\n",
        "7... Qa5+": "?! Black chooses a rather dramatic, yet clumsy method to refute the fork by way of a distracting check, but this too has a tactical refutation.\n",
        "8. Bd2": "! Now there are 3 threats for black to counter.\n",
        "8... Nb4": "Black finds a way out of the traps, but the knight is not in the happiest of positions here due to the pin that it has jumped into.\n",
        "9. O-O": "+/- This prevents any wild ideas of ...Nxd3+, and it gives white a serious lead in development.\n",
        "9... Nb8c6": "Black seeks to catch up in development.\n",
        "10. a3": "!? Creating a future threat once the rook is guarded.\n",
        "10... O-O-O": "Black finally gains king safety, somewhat, and brings the rook into a coordinated attack with the bishop on d3.\n",
        "11. d4": "! Preventing the loss of the pawn, and opens up options for some tactical play.\n",
        "11... cxd4": "Working to clear a path from rook to queen.\n",
        "12. exd4": "Not fearing the rook.\n",
        "12... e6": "?! This move activates another bishop, but I consider ...Nxd4 to be better.\n",
        "13. Bc3": "! Taking advantage of blacks prior weak move to activate the knight trap at b4, axb4 is possible now that the rook is defended.\n",
        "13... Nxd4": "?! Black decides to try a speculative idea to ultimately draw the bishop away, to break the pin, to save the b4 knight.\n",
        "14. Nxd4": "Nothing to lose by accepting the offer.\n",
        "14... Rxd4": "At this point you will notice that there is the option to recapture by Qxd4, but then ...Bc5 chases the queen and takes away any positional advantages, in part because of activating the h8 rook, and because the queen will need to leave the d file at some point.\n",
        "15. Bxd4": "This move really seems correct positionally as it enables a good future attack to be developed.\n",
        "15... Nc2": "?! Here the computer makes an interesting, yet dubious or speculative move, which while interesting does not seem to offer enough advantage.\n",
        "16. Bc3": "!? Repositioning the bishop to prevent an exchange while forcing a queen move instead of the knight, spares the rook in the process of gaining the full d file for the queen.\n",
        "16... Qb6 17. Ra2 Ne3": "?! And the computer makes another speculative move with the idea of gaining some attack against the king. If the c3 bishop were not guarded, then this move would really rock.\n",
        "18. fxe3 Qxe3+ 19. Kh1": "White has much advantage due to material gain and positional aspects, active pieces, and is almost completely winning.\n",
        "19... b6": "++/-  ?? This move is the largest contribution to blacks downfall because it allows white to achieve a completely won game.\n",
        "20. Bd4": "! A fine positional move that forces the queen away to a lesser position, away from the mating attack.\n",
        "20... Qg5 21. Ba6+": "Using the weakness that black created, the king will be drawn out and into the attack.\n",
        "21... Kc7": "The king can not step on the d file or the queen will be lost through tactical methods.\n",
        "22. Be5+": "The king is forced to walk the line, a very thin line.\n",
        "22... Kc6 23. Qd4": "Offering the knight in sacrifice so that a good mating net can be formed.\n",
        "23... Bc5": "? Trying to chase the queen away, but this move suffers for tactical reasons.\n",
        "24. Qc4": "! A pin which can allow the taking of the bishop.\n",
        "24... Bxb1": "The offer is accepted.\n",
        "25. Re2": "! Not chasing the bishop uselessly, but instead holding the e5 bishop, to block the queen from accessing the fight.\n",
        "25... Bf5": "Prevents loss of the bishop.\n",
        "26. b4": "Realizing the benefit of the pin, but I overlook a fast mate due to those greedy material instincts of mine, (26.Qb5+ Kd5 27.Bb7#)\n",
        "26... Bg4": "Black tries desperately to create good counterplay, but nothing is gained.\n",
        "27. Re4": "This move does not appear to be correct at first glance, but it has a powerful point to it.\n",
        "27... Bf5 28. Rd4": "! This is a very powerful move that enables mate in one, providing no distractions are encountered.\n",
        "28... Qxg2+": "A desperate attempt to avoid the mate in one, but it is not enough.\n",
        "29. Kxg2 Bh3+ 30. Kxh3 f6 31. Qb5#": "And so closes the curtain on the final act. This game was quite a lot of fun, and I had to work at improving this opening to achieve better play against the computer. I had some other winning attempts before this game, some wins in about 40 moves, but I wanted to achieve this quicker, and this game realized that goal. I still have some refinements to develop, but this feels like a good start, and this particular opening branch offers white good prospects.\n"
