        "1... d5 2. d4": "well, white has changed the opening to some kind of queen's pawn.",
        "2... Nf6 3. Ne5": "strange...\r\nin that way white plays with the same piece twice (instead of developing other pieces) with no specific plan to jestify his move.\r\nit's better to play solid like 3. c4 or 3. g3 or something like that.",
        "3... c5": "attack!!",
        "4. Nxf7": "not clear.\r\nwhy to sacrifice the piece. there are no one who's attacking with it...",
        "4... Kxf7": "when they give you, take.\r\nwhen they beat you, run.",
        "5. dxc5 e5": "white, with his last move, gave black also the center.",
        "6. b4": "not developing...",
