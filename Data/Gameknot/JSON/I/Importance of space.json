        "2. a3": "I haven't studied this line, and this move seems pointless to me.  Could someone give me a continuation?",
        "2... Nc6": "Going on with my usual development scheme.",
        "3. Nc3 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5 Nf6 6. Bxc6": "? Seems like a waste of time.  Better was probably 6.d4.",
        "6... bxc6": "Capture towards the center and back up d5.",
        "7. h3": "This, again, wastes time.",
        "7... d5 8. exd5": "I might have waited before taking here.",
        "8... cxd5 9. d4 cxd4 10. Qxd4": "Bringing the queen in line with the enemy bishop is never a good idea.",
        "10... O-O 11. Bg5": "This, along with the loose queen, concedes the bishop pair to me.",
        "11... Ne4 12. Qe3 Nxg5 13. Qxg5 d4": "Gaining space.",
        "14. O-O-O": "I pondered over an eventual Bh6, but realized it would probably never work.",
        "14... e5": "Gives me more center control and space, while also unpinning my d-pawn next move.",
        "15. Qxd8 Rxd8 16. Ne4 f5 17. Nc5": "The knight's pretty useless and constricted here.",
        "17... a5 18. Ng5": "Both knights are now loose and become targets of tactical play.",
        "18... Rd6 19. c3": "? Drops a pawn.",
        "19... e4": "This move does more than open the line for the bishop to attack c3...",
        "20. g4": "?? Mandatory was 20.h4, giving the knight a retreat square.",
        "20... h6": "The knight is trapped!",
        "21. Ngxe4 fxe4 22. Nxe4 Rc6": "Adding a third attacker onto c3.",
        "23. Rd3 Ba6 24. Rf3": "Notice how passive white's pieces are.",
        "24... Re8": "Bringing my last piece into play.",
        "25. Re1": "?? This walks straight into a pin and drops the other knight.  The move that loses outright.",
        "25... Rce6 26. Rf4 dxc3 27. bxc3 Bb7 28. f3": "?? Again, blocking the rook's only retreat square.  The game is lost, but better lose a knight than a rook.",
        "28... Bxc3 29. Re2 Be5": "And the rook is trapped!",
        "30. Nc5 Bxf4+": "My opponent must have missed the check that came with taking the rook here, but the game would be lost even if the king were on b1.  Good game, wcates.  I hope you all enjoyed."
