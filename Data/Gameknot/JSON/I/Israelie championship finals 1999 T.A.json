        "17... Ne5": "Great move !!, Its a amazing that both sides have pieces under attack  , black blocks the diagonal a1-h8 and keeps the exchange advantage , the idea is that after 18.fxe-dxe and the bishop and the knight are under attack another idea is to make room for the bishop on b7 to defend the king if he will be forced by ...Bc6,...Bd7 maneuver .",
        "18. fxe5 dxe5 19. Qa4+ Bc6": "Good move , if 19...b5.20.Nxb5!-axb.21.Qxb5+Bc6.22.Qxe5-Qxe5.23.Bxe5-Rg8.24.Nxf8. and white have material advantage bishop and 3 pawns vs a rook and better position .",
