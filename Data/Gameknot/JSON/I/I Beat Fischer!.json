        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+": "The Sicilian Moscow",
        "3... Bd7 4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 5. O-O Nf6 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. Rd1": "This mysterious move of the Rook is book.  Black should answer with 7...Rc8, forcing White's hand on the queenside.",
        "7... g6 8. c3 Bg7 9. d4 cxd4 10. cxd4": "Here Black must challenge White's pawn center with 10...d5.  The game would continue with 11.e5 Ne4 12.Nbd2 Nxd2 13.Bxd2, and Black will plan for a timely f7-f6 break.  The game would be equal.",
        "10... O-O": "This natural move is actually a mistake, as White can reinforce his center and complete his development with ease.",
        "11. Nc3": "Now Black's freeing maneuver doesn't work after 11...d5 12.e5 Ne4?, dropping a center pawn.  White now has a clear advantage in space.",
        "11... e6 12. h3": "This is a useful waiting move, since White is in no hurry with a comfortable space advantage in the center.  White needs to find a good square for the QB, and the text gives White's Bishop development options on e3, f4, and g5.",
        "12... Rac8": "On 12...d5 13.e5 Ne8 (13...Nh5?? 14.g4 +-) 14.Bf4!  Breaking with 14...f6 seems bad for Black after 15.exf6, creating a hole on e5.",
        "13. Bf4 Nh5 14. Bh2 Bh6": "Playing for control of f4.",
        "15. d5": "Thematic central play versus Black's flank play.",
        "15... exd5 16. Nxd5 Ne7": "A horrible blunder, which costs Black a pawn and the exchange.",
        "17. Nxe7+ Qxe7 18. Bxd6 Qf6 19. Bxf8 Nf4 20. Qb5 Kxf8 21. Ne5 Kg7 22. Rd7 Qg5 23. Rxf7+ Kg8": "Here White has the crushing 24.Rg7+!!  Check out the following variations.\n\nA) 24...Kh8 25.Nf7+  Kxg7 26.Nxg5 Bxg5 27.Qxb7+  wins easily.\n\nB) 24...Bxg7 25.Qb3+  Kh8 26.Nf7+  Kg8 27.Nh6+! Kh8 28.Qg8+ Rxg8 29.Nf7# Philidor's Legacy!\n\nC) Black gets eaten alive after 24...Kxg7 25.Qd7+ Kg8 26.Qxc8+ Kg7 (26...Bf8 fails miserably to 27.Qc4+) 27.Qd7+ Kg8 28.Qf7+ Kh8 29.Ng4! threatening 30.Nf6 with a winning position.\n\nD) Escaping with 24...Kf8 doesn't help after 25.Rg8+! Kxg8 26.Qb3+ Kg7 27.Qxb7+ Kf6 28.Ng4+ Ke6 29.Qxc8+ and Black is finished.\n",
        "24. g3": "This also wins easily.",
