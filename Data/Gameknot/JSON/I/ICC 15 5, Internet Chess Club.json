        "4... cxd4 5. Nxd4 Ne7": "Preferable to 5... Nc6 so as to be able to recapture on c6 with a knight hitting the center.\n",
        "6. c4 Nbc6 7. Nxc6 Nxc6": "White should try 8. Be2 and after 8... Nxe5 9. cxd5 exd5 and White has some compensation for the pawn because Black's center pawn is potentially weak.\n\nSo instead Black should try 8... Bb4+ 9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Nxd2 (or 10. Qxd2) Nxe5.\n",
        "8. f4": "This looks naturual, but it weakens the White kingside so much that White is going to have problems on the dark squares.\n",
        "8... Bc5": "This is a natural move controlling the dark squares.",
        "9. Nc3 O-O": "White has three attackers on d5, but Black is not concerned about the loss of pawn because he gets some good play for it.\n",
