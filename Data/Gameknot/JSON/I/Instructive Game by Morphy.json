        "1. e4 e5": "the open games.",
        "2. Nf3": "Morphy advocated this move, and it eventually triumphed over the king's gambit.",
        "2... d6": "the philidor variation. A major drawback of this opening is that black has a space disadvantage and remains quite passive.",
        "3. d4": "the book move. White immediately pressures the black pawns.",
        "3... Bg4": "pinning the knight. ",
        "4. dxe5": "This move is forcing 4...Bxf3 because 4...dxe5  5.Qxd8+ Kxd8  6.Nxe5 and white has a clear advantage.\n",
        "4... Bxf3": "forced.",
        "5. Qxf3 dxe5": "black equalizes material and right now stands with a small disadvantage.",
        "6. Bc4": "morphy develops the bishop to c4 with a mating threat.",
        "6... Nf6": "I believe this move is a mistake. It seems perfectly OK, but white's next move shows that it is a poor move.",
        "7. Qb3": "attacking f7 once more. The queen also eyes b7.",
        "7... Qe7": "defending the pawn on f7. Now white has a critical decision.STOP! Should he or should he not capture on b7? Look at this position and think about it.",
        "8. Nc3": "White forgoes the option of winning material. It looks very tempting. After Qxb7 it looks like the a8 rook is lost, but black has a saving resource Qb4+ cutting his losses to a pawn. The point is, although white wins a pawn, he loses his initiative, and Morphy didn't like that.",
        "8... c6": "now the pawn is protected. White now needs to prove his initiative is worth more than the pawn. He must play very very actively. What move is the best?",
        "9. Bg5": "exclam.  The only move that increases white's initiative.  Some players would have gone with castling or Be3. Some players may have even gone with completely useless moves like h3?. But Morphy realizes that this move only increases his already huge initiative, and he hasn't even sacrificed any material!",
        "9... b5": "At first, this move looks very promising for black. If the bishop moves to safety, then black's position would be completely saved. For example 10.Be2 allows black to get his queen out of the way and get the bishop out and 0-0. \nIf this had happened in the game, it would have been a miracle for black. However, there is a principle:\n\"There cannot be a safe move that the opponent makes to attack you when you are developed.and he is not.\" This move completely violates this. GMs call this \"suicide chess\".  What move did white play here?",
        "10. Nxb5": "exclam. The knight removes the 2 pawns on the queen side that defend the Q side best.",
        "10... cxb5 11. Bxb5+": "Bd5 does not work because black plays Qb4+. Morphy continues the attack. This is the nice thing about having many pieces to attack: You sack one piece, and you still have more than enough force.",
        "11... Nbd7": "forced move.",
        "12. O-O-O": "white is rapidly developing with threats. This is essential in these positions.",
        "12... Rd8": "why not to play 12...Qd6, the move black wants? Because after 13.Rxd7! white will win.",
        "13. Rxd7": "exclam. This is a very instructive position.",
        "13... Rxd7 14. Rd1": "now lets compare this position to the position on move 12. White has just gotten rid of an important defender: the knight, and he still remains with 4 attacking pieces, but black only have 3 defenders.",
        "14... Qe6": "this loses the game. Look at the position and think: What is the correct move?",
        "15. Bxd7+": "very simple and crushing. White forks the king and queen.",
        "15... Nxd7": "Now there is a mate in 2.",
        "16. Qb8+": "exclam.",
        "16... Nxb8 17. Rd8#": "very instructive game. We see that white played very actively in the opening, getting pieces into the attack with tempo. The black rook and bishop never moved once. white got all of his force into the attack and won."
