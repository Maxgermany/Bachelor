        "3... Qe7": "3... Qe7 is a lesser accepted variation. The queen move to e7 is also seen in the Keene variation. According to my book, \"As in the Keene variation, here too Black's concept appears non-trivial.\" ",
        "4. Nc3": "Black intends immediate pressure on e4. From the options of 4. e5 d6; 4. Qe2 b6 (with the idea of Ba6); 4. d3 d5; 4. d4 Qe4; 4. Nc3, 4. Nc3 is the clear favorite. ",

Qe2 (with the idea of Qe2) and White has far superior development. \n4... d5 5. e5 c6 leads towards a line that is reminiscent of the Fisher Variation. \n\nHere f6 could look to a possible g5 push, but presents Black's knight with only the weak h6 square and g5 gains little.

        "14. e5": "Looking to open the file, perhaps slightly better is 14. Rfe1, but as White starts to break open Black's fragile position many moves fit the bill. ",
