        "1. e4": "So he starts with the usual",
        "1... c5": "and I play the Sicilian",
        "2. Nf3": "Mark usually plays the open variation against it.",
        "2... d6": "I normally play Nc6, but I had several games with Mark a week ago, so I decided to play something different from what I was playing last week.",
        "3. d4": "So he continues",
        "3... cxd4": "I take",
        "4. Nxd4": "He takes back",
        "4... Nf6": "I hit the e pawn",
        "5. Nc3": "He defends",
        "5... Nbd7": "So this is the move that I used to play at university.",
        "6. Bg5": "He continues with what he normally plays in the main line. However now of course, there is no threat to double my f pawns, so it is probably not the best move.",
        "6... Qa5": "I am now threatening Nxe4 and Qxg5, but this is easily met, so perhaps it is not the best move. I see on the opening databases, there is no record of 6....Qa5 being played before.",
        "7. Qd2": "Preparing 0-0-0",
        "7... a6": "So I prepare queen side advances. ",
        "8. O-O-O": "He castles",
        "8... b5": "I start my queen side advances, threatening b4 followed by Nxe4",
        "9. f3": "Which is easily met",
        "9... b4": "I attack",
        "10. Nb1": "He retreats. If now Qxa2 11. Qxb5 and my queen is very much out of play. He can play Bc4 forcing Qa1 and even more out of the game. I have to be careful now about move like Nc6 and/or a6 winning my pawn on b4",
        "10... e6": "So I prepare d4, opening up the a3-f8 diagonal, so my pawn is supported by my Bf8",
        "11. Bc4": "He develops",
        "11... Bb7": "And so do I. I want to be able to play d5 and recapture with a piece on d5. If I take back with the e pawn, the e file is open and Rh1-e1 check is very strong. Bb7 also prevents him from playing Nc6",
        "12. a3": "Threatening my pawn on b4",
        "12... d5": "So I open up the diagonal",
        "13. exd5": "He takes",
        "13... Nxd5": "I take back",
        "14. Rhe1": "The logical place to put his rook",
        "14... Nd7b6": "I hit his bishop, re-inforcing my other knight on d5",
        "15. Bb3": "and the bishop drops back",
        "15... Rc8": "This is the logical square for the rook. OK, stop, analyse this position. What would you play now as white?",
        "16. Nxe6": "Yes, here is comes...",
        "16... fxe6": "So I take",
        "17. Rxe6+": "He takes back. Now Ne7 18. Qd7+ wins for white, as does Be7 18. Bxe7 Nxe7 19. Qd7+. 17.....Kd7 looks dreadful for instance Kd7 18. Rxb6 Qxb6 19. Bxd5  and black is falling apart. This leaves just one move.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
        "17... Kf7": "I was now expecting 18. Rxb6 Qxb6 19. Bxd5+ Bxd5 20. Qxd5+ Qe6 21. Qd7+ with a fairly level position, with white having two extra pawns, for the exchange.\r\n",
        "18. Re5": "But he plays this",
        "18... Bd6": "I thought I was Ok now, my rooks are connected. I was expecting 19. Rxd5 Nxd5 20. Bxd5+ Bxd5 21. Qxd5+ Qxd5 22. Rxd5 and again white has two pawns for the exchanges, and it is a level endgame. I may even have a slight edge, and my king, exposed a few moves ago, is now wonderfully centralised for the ending. However he plays....\r\n",
        "19. Qf4+": "Now if Kg6 20. Qf5+ Kh5 21. Bf4+ Kh4 22. Qg4# but I have another option\r\n",
        "19... Kg8": "Luckily there was another square for my king.",
        "20. Qf5": "Queen advances. My search engine says Qg4 also wins for white.",
        "20... Bxe5": "I was actually quite confident here! I missed his winning plan.",
        "21. Qe6+": "Queen checks",
        "21... Kf8": "Forced! Also, stop and work out white's next move.",
        "22. Be7+": "Of course, if I take the bishop, Nxe7, he has Qf7 mate.",
        "22... Ke8": "So I have this alternative. There is actually a mate in two now. 23. Bc5+ Kd8 24. Qe7# , but he picks up my queen instead.\r\n",
        "23. Bxb4+": "It is hopeless for black now",
        "23... Kd8": "As good as anything. He now has a mate in one, Qe7",
        "24. Bxa5": "But he takes the queen instead. It is hopeless for black now. As he was down into his last 5 minutes, I played on to mate, but I don't think any further comments are necessary",
        "24... Bf4+ 25. Nd2 Nc7 26. Bxb6 Re8 27. Qc4 g5 28. Kb1 Re7 29. Qg8+ Kd7 30. Ne4+ Nd5 31. Ba4+ Bc6 32. Qxd5+ Ke8 33. Qg8#": "Many thanks for reading this, I hope you enjoyed it, please leave some comments and rate it with the star system."
