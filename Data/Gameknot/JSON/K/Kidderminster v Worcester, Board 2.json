        "1. e4": "So he starts with the usual",
        "1... c5": "As I do",
        "2. Nc3": "He signifies a preference for a Closed Sicilian",
        "2... Nc6": "And I develop",
        "3. f4": "Usual in this variation, although g3 is more popular (see my annotated game http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/kidderminstervhalesowenbd1?gm=42465)",
        "3... e6": "And I adopt a similar set up as I did in that game.",
        "4. Nf3": "He develops",
        "4... g6": "And so do I",
        "5. Bb5": "He hits the knight",
        "5... Nge7": "And I prevent the doubling of pawns.",
        "6. O-O": "He castles",
        "6... Bg7": "I develop",
        "7. d3": "and so does he",
        "7... a6": "I put the question to his bishop, although later I found out that Nd4 actually scores very well for black. 0-0 seems to be better too.",
        "8. Bxc6": "So he takes",
        "8... Nxc6": "I take back. Now this is an interesting position. After the game my opponent said that he couldn't decide between e5 and f5 and he eventually played e5, and he wasn't sure that this was right. I replied that I thought e5 was stronger, but he made a mistake in not maintaining the pawn on e5, supporting it with Re1 and maybe Qe2, rather than exchanging it. I see on the Gameknot World database, there is one game with e5 Rendle Thomas (2397) vs. Kakkanas Evange\u2026 (2064) which ended in a draw, and one with f5, Lalic, Susan (2320) vs. Makropoulou, Ma\u2026 (2305) which white won. However I still think e5 is stronger!",
        "9. e5": "and now I think I must hit this pawn as soon as possible. As I have two bishops I want to open up the position for my bishops. Rendle Thomas (2397) vs. Kakkanas Evange\u2026 (2064) continued with 9......d5, but why head into a blocked position where his knights are better than my knight and bishop?",
        "9... d6": "The search engine \"Shredder\" now suggests 10. Ne4 as best for White, with a slight advantage for white. I think the move he played was a mistake.",
        "10. exd6": "Shredder thinks it is equal now.",
        "10... Qxd6": "So I take back.",
        "11. Ne4": "He hits the queen. Now Qe7 is the obvious move, keeping the c pawn protected, but I thought that I wanted to prevent him from playing d4, so I played my queen back to d7. Shredder surprisingly suggests retreating to c7 and if 12. Nxc5 then Nd5 winning the pawn back on c2, with equality.",
        "11... Qd7": "Of course he can't take on c5 as I have a check on d4 which picks up the knight on c5.",
        "12. c3": "So he really does threaten Pc5 now. I thought this was a mistake as it leaves the d pawn backward, but Shredder thinks it is best.",
        "12... b6": "So now I do have to protect my c pawn. Shredder likes 13. Ne5 and if Nxe5 14. pxe5 Bxe5 15. Bf4! and if Bxf4? 16. Nf6+ winning the black queen and the game, and after Bg7 Nd6+ \"with a slight advantage to white\". Thankfully my opponent didn't see this and played....",
        "13. Be3": "Reasonable development.",
        "13... Bb7": "Shredder prefers 0-0, but I was wanting to discourage d4. Now 13. d4 can be met with exchanges on d4 and his Ne4 is eventually left to be taken by Bb7",
        "14. Qe2": "Shredder like Bf2 and \"the position is even\". What white plays is plausible.",
        "14... O-O": "At last!",
        "15. Rad1": "Another obvious move. Shredder recommends a room move for black now too, but I wanted to prevent d4 and played.....",
        "15... Qd5": "Which also has the benefit of hitting a2. Shredder now likes b4, but he played...",
        "16. a3": "The obvious move! Shredder now also likes rook moves for black, but I played....",
        "16... a5": "Which Shredder eventually finds too. As well as deterring b4, Bb7 is coming to a6.",
        "17. Nfd2": "Black now stands slightly better, according to Shredder",
        "17... Ba6": "So on with the plan....",
        "18. Nf2": "And white is rather grovelling on the back 3 ranks... I had a long think here. I wanted to play R(a)d8, but was rather unhappy about the reply Nc4, so I eventually played my other rook over, so as to meet Nc4 with R(a)b8 followed by b5. Shredder like Qa2 here",
        "18... Rfd8": "I thought white was rather meaninglessly moving his bits back and forth while I was improving the position of mine, but Shredder still only gives this as slight advantage to black.",
        "19. Nf3 Ra7": "Planning to double on the d file, but without restricting my queen's movements too much.",
        "20. c4": "I thought this was another strategic mistake, making his d pawn forever backward, but in fact Shredder likes this move. Black still slightly better, according to my silicon friend.",
        "20... Qf5": "Keeping on the d pawn.",
        "21. b3": "and I was happy to see this move - I see to have complete dominance of the long black diagonal - but he has a plan to neutralise this.",
        "21... Qf6": "Shredder likes this move.",
        "22. Rdb1": "Preventing my queen coming in.",
        "22... Rad7": "Keeping the pressure on d3",
        "23. Bc1": "Continuing with his plan",
        "23... Bb7": "My bishop has done its job on a6, not doing much there now, time to improve its position. I was dreaming of exchanging my Nc6 for his Nf3, getting my queen and bishop lined up on the long a8-h1 diagonal, so forcing his Nf2 to move, allowing me to take on d3. Unfortunately it didn't quite work out like that! ",
        "24. Qe3": "So he first protects f4 before playing Bb2",
        "24... Qe7": "Shredder prefers Nd4 first.",
        "25. Bb2": "Contesting the long a1-h8 diagonal",
        "25... Nd4": "As part of my plan",
        "26. Nxd4": "He takes",
        "26... Bxd4": "I take back",
        "27. Bxd4": "He takes",
        "27... Rd7xd4": "I take back this way, to keep the pawn d3 under pressure.",
        "28. Rfe1": "Shredder now likes Qd6 and \"Black is slightly better\". I thought Qd6 could be met by 29. Ne4, but Shredder thinks after Bxe4, 30. dxe4 black still has the edge.",
        "28... Qf6": "So I played this",
        "29. g3": "He defends f4",
        "29... Qf5": "Eyeing the weak white squares. ",
        "30. Qe5": "and he offered a draw. I couldn't see any way of winning this, both of us were running low on time, so I accepted. Shredder agrees this is now equal. The question is \"Did I miss a win?\" What do you think dear reader? Please leave a comment or two, and rate my annotation with the star system. Many thanks!"
