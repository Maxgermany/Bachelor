        "1. e4 c5 2. f3": "An awkward second move",
        "2... Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d3 e6 5. Bg5 Be7 6. Nh3 h6 7. Bf4 O-O 8. e5 Nd5 9. Nb5": "In my opinion, it would have been much better for my opponent to take on d5. It appears he didn't have a plan, since he had pretty much forced my knight to move to d5 after playing e5.",
        "9... Nxf4 10. Nxf4 Nxe5": "With the white bishop gone, I win a pawn.",
        "11. d4 cxd4 12. Qxd4": "I always get nervous when my opponent's queen gets out in the open.",
        "12... Bh4+": "I play this move in hopes that my opponent will play g3, but it is a bad habbit to hope.",
        "13. Ke2 Nc6 14. Qc3": "It would have saved white a move if he had not moved there.",
        "14... Bf6 15. Qe3 d5 16. Nh5 Be7 17. Nd4": "Now I must be careful of the white queen coming to the a1-h8 diagonal, threatening mate.",
        "17... Bd6 18. Nxc6 bxc6 19. Qd4 e5": "This was the move I prepared with 17...Bd6. My light square bishop is now free.",
        "20. Qf2 e4": "I was prepared to bring my rook to e8 either after fxe5 or after I pushed it further. After 21...e3, neither queen nor king can take safely on e3 due to Re8 and Be5, respectively.",
        "21. Qd4 Qg5 22. Qxg7+": "In a huge miscalculation, my opponent took on g7.",
        "22... Qxg7 23. Nxg7 Kxg7 24. Kd1 e3 25. Bd3 d4 26. Re1 Re8 27. Rc1 Bxh2": "Now my bishop pair dominates the board, and as you will see, together they prove unstoppable.",
        "28. c3 c5 29. cxd4 cxd4": "Two passed pawns",
        "30. Rc6 Re6 31. Rc7": "A huge blunder. The bishop is almost too far away from the action to be seen.",
        "31... Bxc7 32. g3": "Note that if Bxg3, Rg1 ensues.",
        "32... Bb7 33. Be2 Rd8 34. f4 d3": "There's no stopping my passed pawns as they are supported by the rooks and eachother.",
        "35. Bg4 Re7 36. Rh1": "Deja Vu: My bishop watches from afar.",
        "36... Bxh1": "Deja Vu: My bishup ",
        "37. f5": "Deja Vu: M",
        "37... f6 38. Kc1 e2 39. Kd2 Ba5+ 40. Kc1 e1=Q+": "At this point I called checkmate, and my opponent agreed, that is until my teamates saw otherwise.",
        "41. Bd1 Rc8+ 42. Kb1 Qxd1#": "A great finish to my first game of the 2009/2010 season. I felt good. Rating and commenting are appreciated."
