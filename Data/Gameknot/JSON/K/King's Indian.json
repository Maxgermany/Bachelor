        "1. d4 Nf6 2. e3": "Non-commital, but solid",
        "2... g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. c4 O-O 5. Be2 d6 6. O-O Nc6 7. Nc3 Bg4 8. h3": "Not a great move, and the one that Black was trying to induce with his slightly dubious Bishop sortie. It weakens the Kingside pawn structure and gives Black's light-squared Bishop a target at which to aim itself.",
        "8... Bd7 9. Nh2": "? A move with no solid positional point.",
        "9... e5 10. d5 Ne7 11. e4": "Now we have a fairly standard King's Indian pawn structure, and as such White should be trying to attack Black's Queenside, while Black will aim at White's King.",
        "11... Ne8 12. f4": "?? An awful move. White has no good possibilities on the K-side, and taking the e-pawn will only give Black a monster square on e5 instead of a blocked and passive Bishop.",
        "12... f5": "! The refutation.",
        "13. Bd3 fxe4": "!? Trying to open up the position and make his pieces more active. Also, this is pretty much the only way of convincingly demonstrating the wrongness of White's f4 push.",
        "14. Bxe4 exf4 15. Bxf4 Nf6 16. Bc2 Nf5 17. Bxf5": "? Waste of tempo.",
        "17... Bxf5 18. a3 Re8 19. Nf3": "White, once again, has to redevelop his pieces to aim at the center. However, challenging the e-file with 19. Re1! was the only way for White to hold on.",
        "19... Ne4 20. Nxe4 Rxe4 21. Qc1": "Forced.",
        "21... Re2": "Once again, ganging up on the b-pawn, which White will have to go through some contortions to save.",
        "22. Nd2 Qe7": "Doubling on the e-file and for the moment stopping the c5 push.",
        "23. Ra2": "Kind of a pointless move, but it is hard to suggest anything to White at this point.",
        "23... Re8 24. b4": "Too little, too late. White hits upon the correct idea of advancing his Q-side pawns, but Black dominates in the center far too much for this to end any way but painfully.",
        "24... Bd4+ 25. Kh2": "? 25. Kh1! would have prevented the Black Queen from joining the attack with tempo.",
        "25... Qh4 26. Nf3": "?? A blunder, but White was lost anyway. After 26. Rf3 Black had prepared 26...Rxg2+ 27. Kxg2 Re2+ 28. Kf1 Rf2+ 29. Kg1 Rxf3+ with mate soon after.",
        "26... Qxh3#": "This game illustrates the fact that, although you may have a pawn center in a closed or semi-closed position, often the best course of action is not to attempt an attack on the K-side. Also, when the character of a position changes and becomes more open, centralization often leads to an unstoppable attack when ignored."
