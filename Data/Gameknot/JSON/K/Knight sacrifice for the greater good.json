        "12. Qxe4": "Here he was threatening and i am down a pawn in but I had fianchetto my Bishop and it was eying his Rook and the only way for me to get at the rook was to force d4 to move.  He can't take anything else with his Queen and it draws his Queen out from behind its defenses and leaves it with no defenders, and by drawing out his Queen (since he had not Castled yet) I could take away his right to Castle and draw him off the back line.\n",

        "13... Nxc5": "Here is where I made a huge choice to sacrifice my Knight so I could take his b7 and a7 pawns.  I knew it would put me down in materiel (one Knight for 2 pawns) but I felt like even though I would be down in material I would have some things going for me (passed pawn, his King exposed, and his rook under distress.)  I knew he wouldn't resist the temptation to play dxc5 and he would still think he was in a solid attacking position, but after I play Bxb2, he is immediately on the defense.  \n",
        "14. dxc5": "He takes my bait (I know that was probably considered a bad move, but I got good return for my investment.  Qxc5 is also a good move\n",
        "14... Bxb2": "Putting pressure on his Rook he has to sacrifice his a pawn to keep it. In the actual game I played Qxc5 with the idea of Bxb2 afterwords but after I played Qxc5 he blundered and played b3 and I took his Rook and he resigned.  But I still wanted to look at the position I would have been playing from if he didn't blunder. \n",

        "17... Bg7": "My Bishop is back to its Sniping position his Queen-side is completely exposed.  In the actual game I played he blundered and resigned, but this is a possible position I could have been in with my sacrifice"
