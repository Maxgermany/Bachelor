        "1. d4": "Well, recently after hitting my 6 month personal best and finally breaking 1300 I decided that I was hot shit and took on more games...so now my ratting is crashing like the NSX...well OK, its not that bad.\n\nAnyways, this was a pretty good game I had with pastordon until I started to loose focus, very frustrating.",
        "1... d5 2. c4": "Queens gambit, Decide to accept, not having a lot of experience with this opening.",
        "2... dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 c5 5. Bxc4": "So here black has set up a typical queens gambit...I think.  I remember getting a little bit worried here thinking that he certainly had the upper hand this early in the game...I don't really know any of the openings used to counter the QG",
        "5... e6": "I did this is prevent Nf5 at some point, and because its just a general common sense opening move.",
        "6. O-O Bd6": "Making room to cast and staking out my share of the center.",
        "7. Nc3": "This had me getting worried, fearing some sort of e5 fork.",
        "7... a6": "I decided to attack his flanks because it looked to me like a fight for the center would go to him.",
        "8. d5 b5": "I decide to try his bishop, fearing that he would attack with his d pawn anyways, although in hindsight it doesn't look to be such a threat.",
        "9. Bb3": "White pulls back and I breathe a sigh of releaf (no idea how to spell that) and pick up some momentum",
        "9... O-O": "I decide to use my tempo for the castle",
        "10. h3": "And white plays what I feel to be a questionable move, obviously fearing an attacking on h2",
        "10... b4 11. Ne2": "I think white would have been better off to have done this last move",
        "11... Qe7 12. Ba4 Bd7 13. Bb3 exd5": "I was pretty surprised that he let me win that pawn",
        "14. Re1": "White is starting to set up some heavy  E D presure",
        "14... Nc6": "Fearing infiltration by horseback I dispatch my knight",
        "15. a3 a5 16. Nf4": "I was really hopping that he would trade rooks on the a file, but obviously he knew better",
        "16... c4 17. Ba4 Ne5": "This move took me quite a while to figure out, but I was pretty happy for the chance to trade off one of his knights",
        "18. Bc2 b3": "I was really enjoying this pawn push, thinking that I was pretty smokin stuff",
        "19. Bb1": "I was expecting him to either fall all the way back as he did or to sac for h7 to generate some movement...obviously he made the right choice.",
        "19... a4": "This was probably a wasted move",
        "20. e4": "This move pretty much set of the central exchange, which I wasn't really about, but had been building for a while",
        "20... Nxf3+ 21. Qxf3 Bc6 22. Qe2 Rac8 23. Bd2 dxe4 24. Qxc4 Bxf4 25. Bxf4 Rfe8 26. f3 Qa7+": "I think this was a bad move...seemed kind of useless",
        "27. Be3 Qa5 28. Bxe4 Bxe4 29. Qb4 Qa8 30. fxe4 Rxe4": "This also may have been the wrong probably a little to aggresive",
        "31. Qd6 Re6 32. Qg3 Ne4 33. Qg4": "I can already tell I'm screwed, my rook is out of possition and the knight is in trouble",
        "33... Qa5 34. Bd4 f6 35. Rxe4 Rxe4 36. Qxe4 Rd8 37. Bc3 Qa7+": "I was trying to do anything to break out, but his possition was very good and left me no where to break him",
        "38. Kh1 Qf2 39. Qg4 Kh8 40. Re1 h5": "and I blunder, a shure sign that I have lost focus",
        "41. Qxh5+ Kg8 42. Qg4 Qa7 43. Bxf6 Rd2 44. Re7 Rd1+ 45. Qxd1 Qxe7": "and I resign, the rook attack was a desperate move that I figured was worth a shot.  "
