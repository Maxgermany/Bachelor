        "3. Nf3 g6 4. d4": "Oups, an open sicilian -> back to the good old dragon sicilian.",
        "4... cxd4 5. Nxd4 Bg7": "Obviously not Nxd4 Qxd4 and the attack on h8 rook is annoying.",
        "6. Be3": "Reinforce the center",
        "6... d6": "One more control on e5 before Nf6. Nf6 is better, and main line according to GK database. I'm not a sicilian player, if you are familiar with this opening, please add comment.",
        "7. Qd2 Bd7 8. O-O-O a6 9. Bc4 Nf6 10. f3 O-O": "White played the opening precisely and as a better developement, more space and a strong center. Black already have an open column to attack the king, + some tempo as Bc4 and Nc3 will have to move in case of b7-b5-b4.\nI prefer white anyway.\nPlan for white : pawn storm on the king and attack !!!\nPlan for black : pawn storm on the king and attack !!!",
        "11. g4 b5 12. g5": "!? Bb3 seems better, white probably wants an open file.",
        "12... bxc4": "A pawn is a pawn ! I thought : if I cannot do the classical exchange sacrifice on c3, never mind, I'll pressure on b2 instead.",
        "13. gxf6 Bxf6 14. Qe2": "I was expecting 14.h4 h5 15.f4 16.f5, or 14.Nxc6 BxN 15.Bh6 Re8 16.h4 17.h5, more agressive.",
        "14... Na5": "Played in the ugliest style :(p",
        "15. Bh6 Re8 16. Be3": "I was expecting h4 or f4. With opposite castle, one should attack the king as fast as possible !\nWhite last 3 moves wasted some time. Ok, my pieces don't look clever either.",
        "16... Rb8 17. Kb1 Rb7": "17. ...Qb6, straight to the point (b2) was better !",
        "18. Ka1 Qb6 19. Rdb1": "Ayo ! How can you forget your good old knight like that ?\nIf 19.Nb3 Qb4 20.Nc5 Qb5 21.Nxf6+ exN and the knight is dead.\nBut 19.Ndb5 ! Qc6 20.Nd4 and draw offer.",
        "19... Bxd4 20. Bxd4 Qxd4 21. Rhd1 Qe5": "With a knight up, it is an easy win :D\nIf I do not blunder. Ayo ! How can I forget my good old knight like that ? Qg7 or Qf6, obviously",
        "22. Rd5 Qe6 23. Rxa5": "My poor old brave knight...",
        "23... Ra8 24. h4 h5 25. Qg2": "Both players pieces are a bit messy, aren't they ?",
        "25... Bc6 26. Rxh5": "!\nAyo, my good old pawn !",
        "26... Rab8 27. Ra5 Qf6": "Threaten the knight, and behind it b2 pawn and king",
        "28. Ra3 Qxh4 29. Qf1": "Rh1 Qf6 Qh2 would have been troublesome.",
        "29... Qh2 30. Qe2 Qxe2": "I exchanged because Queen is white most active piece. In the coming endgame, white kingis out of play, and the rooks are tight to defense.",
        "31. Nxe2 Rb7b6": "A pawn is a pawn. Protect it.",
        "32. Nd4 Bd7 33. Rc3 e5": "Pushed to gain control of e6 for the bishop.",
        "34. Ne2 Be6 35. a4": "White position is quite difficult to play. May be try b3 to free b1 rook, but where can it go ?",
        "35... Rb6b4 36. Ra3 d5": "To start the kingside pawn majority advance, and to prepare an attack on the remaining pawn in case of exchange. I should play it before Nc3.",
        "37. exd5 Bxd5 38. f4": "? facilitate black task of creating passed pawns.",
        "38... exf4 39. Nc3": "I don't understand why white didn't take back the pawn, but thanks",

        "43. Rc1 Ra5 44. Nf2": "This time, white choose not to offer the knight but the king, strange echo to move 19 where the king was saved by the knight.",
