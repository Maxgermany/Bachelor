        "1. d4 d6 2. e4 e5": "This is an ill-advised opening pattern for black because of 3.dxe5 dxe5 4. Qxd8 Kxd8, which leaves black unable to castle.",
        "3. Nf3": "I probably should have taken the pawn right away instead of waiting. Black could have simply taken on d4.",
        "3... Nf6": "This was another error by Black that allows me to win the e pawn. ",
        "4. Nc3": "Play should have continued 4.dxe5 dxe5 5. Qxd8 Kxd8 6. Nxe5 Be6 7. Nc6 (or f3). This again allows for exd4",
        "4... c6": "Luckily my opponent made a mistake again.",
        "5. dxe5 dxe5 6. Qxd8+ Kxd8 7. Nxe5 Bd6": "Another mistake. It is pointless to threaten a piece away that has the intention of moving elsewhere next turn.",
        "8. Nxf7+ Ke8 9. Nxh8 Bc5": "Again, just as in my first game, my opponent moves his bishop twice, perhaps since the only reason he put it on d6 in the first place was to chase away my knight.",
        "10. Bc4 Ng4 11. Nd1": "It would have been better just to castle here.",
        "11... Ne5 12. Bb3 Nbd7 13. a3": "I can't remember why I made this move.",
        "13... Nf6 14. O-O": "Why did I just ignore the e pawn? Why didn't I castle on the previous turn?",
        "14... Nxe4 15. Re1 Bf5 16. Bf4 Ng4": "Too bad I couldn't fork with f3.",
        "17. Be3 Rd8": "My opponent neglected the pin on the knight.",
        "18. Bxc5 Kd7 19. Nf7": "Black essentially forked my knight and bishop, so I figured trading a bishop and knight for a rook would be the best line.",
        "19... Nxc5 20. Nxd8 Kxd8 21. Ne3 Nxe3 22. Rxe3 Kc7 23. Rd1": "My opponent resigned, mostly because he was tired of playing, but I still got something out of this short game."
