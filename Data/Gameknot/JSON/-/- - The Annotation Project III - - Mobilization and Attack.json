        "1. e4": "This is my 3rd game as White in Freddy's (easy19) third edition of the Annotation Project.  I thought this game might be a bit interesting, particularly for those in the tourney.  The first six moves are all predetermined.",
        "1... c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+": "Although not required, this move is a must.",
        "7... Kd7 8. Be6+ Ke8 9. Bf7+": "I really wanted Black's K to move to c7 and then b6.  ",
        "9... Kd7 10. Be6+ Ke8": "With this move, it became apparent that Black was either going to keep his K at e8, or we were going to draw through perpetual.  No fun in that.",
        "11. Bxg4 e5 12. Nc3": "White has to mobilize his pieces and create an attack as quickly as possible, while constraining Black or White gives away the advantage.",
        "12... exf4 13. Ncxe4 Be7 14. Ne6": "This is where the N is happiest.",
        "14... Qb6": "In my calculations, this is where I expected the Q to go.  It prevents White from O-O and attacks b2, perhaps containing the DSB.",
        "15. d3": "I was prepared to give up b2 to the Queen to launch an attack.  As White in this tourney, I think it's a mistake to play passively.  Perhaps 16. Bxf4 Qxb2 17. O-O  I'm not sure if this would be correct but this was my idea.",
        "15... Bh4+": "This move surprised me.  I was expecting the N to come out (perhaps 15...Nd7, 16...Nf6) to disrupt White's attack and get another piece into the action.  I wasn't sure of the purpose of Bh4+, except perhaps to disrupt White's K-side pawn structure and make O-O less desirable.",
        "16. g3 fxg3 17. hxg3": "Forced or the Rook goes bye-bye.",
        "17... Bf6": "17...Bf6 is an error in my view.  I believe that Be7 was needed to prevent Nd6+, followed by Nc4, attacking the Q while at the same time guarding b2 and allowing O-O-O",
        "18. Nd6+ Kd7 19. Nc4": "Black's Q has very few safe squares, particularly given the discovered check by White's LSB.",
        "19... Qb4+": "Black's plan is to withdraw the Q safely (obviously).  However, this allows the DSB to develop with tempo.",
        "20. Bd2 Qe7": "White's N is pinned but protected from any attack.  Black's N has not move nor has either of his Rooks.",
        "21. O-O-O": "Breaking the pin, connecting the rooks, and the preparing for a full assault on the King.",
        "21... Ke8": "21...Ke8 loses the Q with 22 Rhe1.  dmaestro told me after the game that he considered 21...Qxe6  22. Bxe6  Kxe6 with even material.  I think that would have been interesting but White would still have held the advantage given that his other pieces were developed and his King was safely tucked away.",
        "22. Rhe1": "And Black resigns.  My thanks to dmaestro for the game.  This is a really interesting tourney.  I wonder if freddy will be able to come up with The Annotation Project IV?"
