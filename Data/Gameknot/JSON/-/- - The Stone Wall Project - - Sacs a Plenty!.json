        "9. O-O": "and a common follow-up to the position\n",
        "9... Nd7": "This being one of the first games that I had started in the tournament, I wanted to get out of the line of the sample game. This prepares to get rid of a future Ne5...\n",
        "10. Ne5": "...which is indeed what happens.\n",
        "10... Ndxe5": "I wonder whether 10...f6 would have been better here? Perhaps not, since 11.Nxc6 bxc6 weakens Black's queenside pawns... Besides, this move does turn out just fine for Black\n",
        "11. fxe5 b5": "Black now has a little more confidence to start activity queenside!\n",
        "12. Nf3": "Moving the knight to a more active position\n",
        "12... a5": "Consistent with Black's queenside plans\n",
        "13. e4": "! not a bad move at all! This move opens up the position on the kingside, and both of White's bishops look intimidating at where they lie. \n",
        "13... b4": "having identified no threats to the Black position, Black pushes on queenside\n",
        "14. exd5": "It was better to allow White to exchange pawns than it was for Black; after 13...dxe4 14.Bxe4 White gets a tempo attack on my knight\n",
        "14... exd5": "Black didn't mind this pawn excahnge too much - now the light-square bishop can get into the action kingside...\n",
        "15. Bxh7+": "!? Speaking of light square bishops... White's first sac. I had not expected an attack this early, and indeed White is able to exert a reasonable amount of pressure on Black, but ultimately the attack fades away, albeit with an interesting position for both sides\n",
        "15... Kxh7 16. Ng5+": "This was the reason I wouldn't have considered Bxh7 as an option - Black simply gets rid of this piece with Bxg5... in fact, it wins a piece (White's second sac) Well... not exactly...\n",
        "16... Bxg5 17. Qh5+": "Keeping up the pressure!\n",
        "17... Bh6": "An alternative would have been Kg8, but this must be better - after Bxg5, I don't like the pressure from White's queen and bishop...\n",
        "18. Bxh6": "! Now I see what White's plan is, though I have no idea whether he forsaw this back at move 15, or he used this move as a saving grace. White is five points down, and this is the only move that remedies that...\n",
        "18... gxh6 19. Rf6": "Threatens mate in 3; 20.Rxh6+ Kg8 21.Rh8+ Kg7 22.Qh7#. At this point. there really is only one way to deal with this threat...\n",
        "19... Qxf6": "... but I don't mind too much - Black's first sac. With the material that White sacrificed to get this attack, I can afford this - in fact, I am still a point up!\n",
        "20. exf6": "White now has a queen and pawn for a bishop, knight and rook - let's see where this goes! :)\n",
        "20... Be6": "First of all, Black needs to activate his rook, and as it is tied down to the defence of f7 Black employs his bishop to do that job\n",
        "21. Rf1": "White brings his second (and last) piece to where the action is\n",
        "21... Rfg8": "With the idea of driving away the enemy queen\n",
        "22. g3": "White may be envisioning Black doubling rooks on the g-file, so this move pre-empts that. I have no idea whether White knew this or not (probably not) but both moves are a prelude to Black's downfall... [well, just White's rook move now I think about it]\n",
        "22... Rg5 23. Qe2": "I had planned, at first, 23...Bh3, to pressure the rook and to have the bishop in an intimidating position. It would also halt the advancement of the g and h pawns. However, I now noticed the alluring position of the rook and queen; the pieces had positioned themselves on the same light square diagonal... and I have a light square bishop...\n",
        "23... Bf5": "?? I changed my plans; after all, a bishop at d3 is more active than a bishop at h3. Now, White is forced to move one of his pieces, then the other after Bd3. White elects to move his rook first...\n",
        "24. Rxf5": "!! White's third sac, and this is one that Black dare not accept. 24...Rxf5 25.Qc2 Kg6 26.g4, and next moves the White Queen comes breathing down the Black king's neck. In short, Black just blundered away a piece. [a shame, too... it was shaping out to be an interesting struggle]",
        "24... Rag8": "By not accepting the sac, Black hopes to keep the queen away from the king... but even then the situation is dire. Black's queenside pawns would be a fine meal for White's queen.\n",
        "25. Rxg5": "Rook exchange....\n",
        "25... Rxg5": "?? But the wrong recapture. This just turned a bad situation a lot worse!\n",
        "26. Qe8": "! Now the knight has no flight squares! Na7 is met with Qf7+\n",
        "26... bxc3": "Black still has some tricks up his sleeve - if White messes up and plays Qxc6??, then c2!! brings back Black's queen\n",
        "27. bxc3": "Nope, not gonna happen!\n",
        "27... Nxd4": "Black's second sac.... not that he had much choice :P \n",
        "28. cxd4": "Black is most definitely losing, but there's still a slim hope for him, in the form of the d and c pawns in the centre. If Black can only get rid of the d4 pawn, then he'll have a pair of connected passed pawns... [White missed Qf7+ first though - that's something :)] \n",
        "28... Kg6": "First, though. Black needs to defend f7 [no more Qf7+ now :P]\n",
        "29. Qa4": "White looks to get a passed pawn on a2...\n",
        "29... Rg4": "White I look to get my connected passed pawns! :)\n",
        "30. Qxa5 Rxd4": "Mission accomplished...\n",
        "31. Qc3": "... but of course, there are still complications.\n",
        "31... Rd3": "Chasing the queen away...\n",
        "32. Qb2": "perhaps it looks at first glance that 32...c3 continues the queen chase, but then comes Qc2 and Black can say good-bye to his rook and any chance at a swindle\n",
        "32... d4": "?! However, the same trick is used here, though not as devastating as teh c3 line. Perhaps Black was being too hasty here? (though I can't see what else I could have done here...)\n",
        "33. Qc2": "(!)\n",
        "33... Kxf6": "Might as well turn it into an exchange\n",
        "34. Qxc4 Rd1+": "Gives Black a tempo for his passed pawn\n",
        "35. Kf2 d3 36. a4": "Passed pawns must be pushed :)\n",
        "36... d2 37. Qc2": "! Black cannot hold on to the d-pawn. However, I thought otherwise during the game...\n",
        "37... Rh1": "?? I saw the trap 38.Qxd2?? Rxg2!!, and jumped at the chance to set it (Black's king would be able to stop the a pawn in time). The problem is that White has a trick of his own that wins Black's rook and effectively ends the game for him. The only possible moves for Black would have been Re1 or Rc1... but I reckon that even if I had seen White's trick, I would have played this anyway - desperate times call for desperate measures!\n",
        "38. Qc6+": "! King fork! [Ra1 would have been similarly met with Qc3+]",
        "38... Kg5 39. Qxh1": "If it weren't for Freddy's stipulation on not resigning any of our games, I would have thrown in the towel here. Since I have to play on, I form vague plans of a stalemate opportunity \n",
        "39... Kg4 40. Ke2 Kh3 41. Qf1+": "Giving up the h2 pawn?\n",
        "41... Kxh2": "Taking the 'free' pawn just shortens Black's misery. Now White can mate... [Mate in 3, to be exact - I've created a puzzle for that :)]\n",
        "42. Kf2": "...like this.\n",
        "42... d1=Q": "Black can survive for just a bit longer here... [you'd know if you did my puzzle ;)]\n",
        "43. Qg2#": "...but at the very least, the game is allowed to end with even material :) Good game! \n"
