        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nIt is really nice to follow up my epic draw with the Master Mater with a victory that has pushed my rating within touching distance of Class A 1800+ status.  This victory was against a Class C player by the name of Steve.  Steve wasn't doing too badly until he left a pawn en prise which allowed Glenda to wreak mayhem in his camp.  Steve was aware that his b pawn was en prise but he thought he could trap Glenda.  Unfortunately for him, he only realised I had a saving resource after he hit the submit button - I know the feeling there, Steve, just look at my 50th game against the Master Mater on Move 11 when I thought I was gonna win Freddy's rook, but then instead found myself bereft of Fou Lenoir.  Sadly Steve's game went downhill after that.  Anyhow, Gameknot analysis is provided for this game:  Please look in my past games profile dated 7.11.10 for the game.",
        "1... c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4 Kb6": "9. ...... Kb6 - instead of moving Henry to e1 against the lower rated players and risking conceding a Low Draw, Henry has always found himself on b6.  So far, he has been a lucky old codger!",
        "10. a4": "10. a4 - allo allo allo, we have a Wing Attack on Henry but can it succeed.  This is very reminiscent of Master Freddy here.",
        "10... e5 11. a5+ Ka6 12. O-O Bc5+": "12. ...... Bc5+ - after playing the freeing e5 on move 10 Fou Lenoir now develops to give a tempo-gaining check.",
        "13. Kh1 Re8 14. Be2+ b5": "14. ...... b5 - I anticipated that Be2+ but I did not fear a discovered check by PxP ep.",
        "15. Nxe4 Nd7": "15. ...... Nd7 - development.",
        "16. Nbc3 Kb7 17. Nxc5+ Nxc5": "17. ...... Nxc5 - Fou Lenoir is lost for one annoying steed but at least I am still up on material.",
        "18. Bf3 e4": "18. ...... e4 - block, block, block is Jo's motto!",
        "19. Be2 a6 20. b4 Nd7 21. Bb2 Nf6": "21. ...... Nf6 - I improve the position of my knight and back up my pawn on e4.",
        "22. d3 exd3 23. Bxd3": "23. Bxd3 - pawn trade.",
        "23... Rc8 24. Rad1 Qe7": "24. ...... Qe7 - Glenda dodges a nasty discovery on the d column, i.e. Bf5 (attacking c1 rook) and she attacks the pawn on b4.",
        "25. Rd2": "25. Rd2 - my opponent thought he could trap Glenda.",
        "25... Qxb4 26. Ba1 Qxa5": "26. ..... Qxa5 - but after clicking the submit button he found he could not and now Glenda is like the proverbial bull in the china shop.  Glenda the Defender she may be, but not always as some of my recent opponents have just found out to their cost!",
        "27. Rfd1 Rcd8 28. Ne2": "28. Ne2?? - this move is very bad although it is not obvious until my steed on c3 moves to e4.  Note white's lsb is PINNED to the rook on d2 and now that rook is trapped and white now must give up a further piece to try and save it.",
        "28... Ne4 29. Bc3 Nxc3 30. Nxc3 Qxc3": "30. ..... Qxc3 - Glenda is just soooo ruthless it is unbelievable!",
        "31. Rf2": "31. Rf2 - this move allows some much wanted simplification.",
        "31... Re1+ 32. Rxe1 Qxe1+ 33. Rf1": "33. Rf1 - Steve's light square bishop prevents a visit from Old Matey, the Chessic Grim Reaper on his back row.",
        "33... Qc3 34. h4 Rxd3 35. cxd3 Qxd3": "35. ...... Qxd3 - a simplification sacrifice - I have done this motif many times before with the Dentist.  Steve now moves his rook onto an attacked square.",
        "36. Rb1 Qxb1+ 37. Kh2 Qf5 38. g3 Qg4": "38. ..... Qg4 - Glenda moves in to confine the WK to the first two ranks.",
        "39. Kg2 c5": "39. ..... c5 - this move clears a path for Henry to close in on the WK.",
        "40. Kf2 Kc6 41. Kg2 Kd5": "41. ..... Kd5 - Steve sees that I am closing in on a typical K + Q v K kiss of death type mate and waves the white flag here.  An instructive game."
