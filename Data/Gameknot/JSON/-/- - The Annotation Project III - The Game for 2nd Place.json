        "1. e4": "This was my final game in freddy's AP-III tourney and one in which I had been looking forward.  I always enjoy my games against joanne and this game was to decide second place in the tourney--somehow, freddy had managed to eek out first place ;)  The thematic moves end around move 9.",
        "1... c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4 Kb6": "Black moves her King away from the fork with Nc3.  Of course, the goal for Black is to now activate her pieces and protect her King while White seeks to cramp black and attack the exposed King.",
        "10. d3": "10. d3?  I give this move a ? as I feel it is a mistake.  Every other game as White I have moved (as has most everyone else) 10. Nc3.  I could provide a number of excuses why I didn't do so but the fact was I was simply not paying attention and moved d3 one turn early.  As I told joanne, at least this will insure we have few, if any, games to rely upon for study.",
        "10... e5": "10. e5  Black immediately sets about to free her pieces.  If she is able to do so, her material advantage should lead to a win.",
        "11. Nc3": "development",
        "11... Nd7": "11...Nd7  I think that Black was anticipating 12. Be3+ and was marshalling forces to cover c5.  And given that White has allowed e5, Black's Bishop is able to provide additional support (along with Rc8). ",
        "12. Ncxe4": "The N is now centralized but in hindsight, moving 12. Be3 may have been better.  As after 12. Ncxe4 Black can move Nf6, forcing an exchange of Ns, which must be good for Black.  Another line that seems good for Black is 12...Nf6  13. Be3+\t  c5 14.Nxc5  Bxc5  15.Bxc5+ Kxc5  Although the Black King is exposed, it's not clear how White can immediately take advantage of this.",
        "12... exf4": "12...exf4  I didn't like this move for Black as White is able to bring the DSB out while cutting off another escape route for the K.  White must also be careful not to move Ng5 until the K has castled otherwise Qh4+ could lose the Bishop.",
        "13. Bxf4 a5": "Preparing to move the K to safety.",
        "14. O-O-O": "I could see nothing better so I thought to continue development.  I didn't move 14. Nf7 and fork the Q/R as I didn't want to trade a somewhat active N for an inactive R.  At this point, Black is not really developed and I'm hoping to keep it that way.",
        "14... Qe8": "Avoiding the potential fork of Q/R by N",
        "15. Rhe1": "Clearly threatening the Q.",
        "15... Rd8": "15. Rd8?  This move surprised me as it resulted in Black having to give up her Q.",
        "16. Nf6": "At this point, the Queen only has one square where she is not immediately attacked, but moving 16...Qg6 would be problematic for Black.  For example:  Qg6\n17.\tNxd7+\tRxd7\n18.\tBxd7\t and White is winning.  Another line might be \tQg6\n17.\tNxd7+\tKa6\n18.\tRe6\tQxe6\n19.\tBxe6 which was also bad for Black.",
        "16... Nxf6": "In my opinion, this is Black's best option.",
        "17. Rxe8 Rxe8": "At this point, White clearly has the more active game.  The trick is to try and press this advantage.",
        "18. Bf3 Be7 19. Nf7 Rhf8 20. Ne5": "I'm bringing the N to c4 to try and concentrate the attack on the K.",
        "20... Ka7 21. Nc4 Nd5 22. Bg3": "I really wanted to keep my B-pair.",
        "22... b6 23. Ne5 Bg5+ 24. Kb1 Kb7 25. c4": "Gaining space and trying to expose Black's K.  ",
        "25... Ne7 26. d4": "Here, I thought to continue grabbing space and I also saw the possibility of exploiting my Q-side pawn majority.",
        "26... Bf4": "But I missed this move.  I did not want to exchange Bishops but if I moved by DSB away, I would have lost h2.",
        "27. Bxf4 Rxf4 28. d5": "I had worked out the next few moves and as I calculated, I was going to be left with a passed pawn on the 6th rank.",
        "28... Nxd5 29. cxd5 Rxe5 30. dxc6+ Kc8 31. Rd7": "I think White's pieces are nicely coordinated at this point.  ",
        "31... Rg5": "Protecting g7.",
        "32. Be2": "I was willing to sac g2 so I could move Ba6+",
        "32... Rc5": "I expected 32...b5 blocking my LSB after which I may have been planning 33. Rb7  (I can't find my notes to this game).",
        "33. Ba6+ Kb8": "forced.",
        "34. Rb7+": "34.  Rb7+  I was hoping that Black would move Kc8 which would have allowed White to take Rf4 via discovered check. ",
        "34... Ka8": "I would have been surprised if it actually happened but I saw no reason not to provide the opportunity for Black to err.",
        "35. Rxg7": "The next trap would have been for Black to play 35...Rxc6 36. Bb7+ and the R falls.  Worst case scenario at this point is White gobbles up the K-side pawns and creates a couple of passers.  ",
        "35... b5": "35...b5  And Black lays a trap of her own.  If White isn't paying attention and pushes c6 toward the promised land, then 36...Rf1#",
        "36. a3 Rfc4": "36...Rfc4  This prevents c6  from pushing forward",
        "37. Rxh7": "Well, might as well take another pawn.",
        "37... a4 38. g4": "If Black isn't going to allow c6 to advance, it's time to push the g-pawn.",
        "38... Rxg4 39. c7 Rgc4 40. c8=Q+": "40 c8=Q+ gets a ?  Yes, White ends up trading B+P for a R, but it could have been much better.  40. Rh8+  Ka7 41. c8=Q+ Rxc8 42. Bxc8 and Black could resign.",
        "40... Rc5xc8 41. Bxc8 Rxc8": "Instead, White is up a pawn and should win--but Black is aware that White's does not have a strong endgame and makes Black prove the win.",
        "42. Rh5 Rb8 43. Rh4 Kb7 44. Rb4": "I thought to blockade both of Black's pawns and push h2",
        "44... Kc6 45. Kc1 Rh8 46. h4 Rh5 47. Kc2 Kd6 48. Kd3 Ke6 49. Ke3 Kf6 50. Kf3 Kg6 51. Kg3 Kh6 52. Kg4": "And now the trick becomes, How does White advance h4?",
        "52... Rc5 53. Kg3 Rd5 54. Kf3": "I decided to walk my King back a bit",
        "54... Kh5 55. Ke3 Kg6": "55...Kg6 loses.  This allows the R to check and then push to g5",
        "56. Rg4+ Kh6 57. Rg5": "If Black exchanges Rs, then the White K picks off Black's pawns and Queens and if the Black R moves, White moves Rxb5.\n\nAs always, I enjoy my games against joanne.  I look forward to Annotation Project IV.  Any and all comments/criticisms are welcomed and appreciated."
