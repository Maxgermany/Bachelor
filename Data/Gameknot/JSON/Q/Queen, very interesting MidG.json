    "moves": {
        "1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. h3": "I always play this move in order to safely place my black bishop on f4, without fearing Nh5. I just consider this bishop too valuable to get it changed or retired.\nBut I am a \"self made opening\" player, I must admit.",
        "3... Bf5 4. Bf4 Nc6 5. e3 e6 6. g4 Be4 7. Nbd2 h6 8. Bb5 Bd6 9. g5": "This is the typical risky-move that costed me a lot of reasoning, and maybe I was wrong. \nThe situation worths some advice, but is not the particular item I am really interested in, in this play. \n",
        "9... hxg5 10. Bxg5 a6 11. Bxc6+": "The plan is to take advantage of the weak c6. I even considered the sacrifice of the rook h1, in some variants. ",
        "11... bxc6 12. Nxe4 dxe4 13. Ne5": "I played this in order to get a bishop against a knight, forcing queen's exchange, in order to enter in an endgame with an edge due to doubled and isolated pawn, the d column supported by my bishop, and the weakness of e4...\n\nI thought black cannot defend c6 but taking my knight with Bd6xe5. I planned this from the moment I moved my bishop to b5. After this, queen exchange is forced since the black knight is pinned. That leaves me with a rook on my d column, and his knight is not in a comfortable position: if it goes to h5, it's only plan can be to move f6, allowing to exchange my doubled e5 pawn. I think it would have been the better move for this knight. My counterplay is the weakness of his pawn in e4. If he defends it with f5, it leaves a good diagonal for my bishop, even if it has to retire in g3. It points to c7, and if this pawn is moved, to b8. \nThank to another comment, I now realize that black can put his queen in b8. I dind't see it as a possibility, I just saw he has to take away his knight. ",
        "13... Bxe5 14. dxe5 Qxd1+ 15. Rxd1": "I got it! I'm better now! I lost the queenside castling, though.\nQueen castle is not so important, since the b column is open for him. Though, he cannot take too much advantage of it. With the castling, b2 is defended by my king and if he want to use his pawns to attack, it is a long journey and it would be easy for me to defend. \nIn order to complement the 13\ufffd move's considerations, his knight can go to d5, blocking the d column to my rook action (aiming to d8), and threatening an attack on my queen's pawns. But I again can defend it easily with rook d4, that both takes the e4 pawn and prevents Kb4. He can go on with c5, supporting his knight, to which I could have answered a3. \nThis leaves the time for him to castle, but if he does so, I would have played rook g1, threatening bishop h6, and planned to advance my h pawn too. I think it would have been his best plan, though. After he puts his rook in d8, I would have allowed he to exchange rooks, and my king could participate in the defence of my queen-side pawns. ",
        "15... Nd7 16. Bf4": "Of course, it will take time to get something of this. But e4 (or c7) is mine! True or false?",
        "16... Nb6 17. Rd4 Rd8 18. Rxe4": "As predicted... I forsaw this. ",
        "18... c5": "The \"simple\" answer was c4. He cannot play f5 because of e5xf6. But, if he now plays Na4, I will have let him enter and play against my king, so...",
        "19. Bg5 Rd5 20. c4": "NOW I can play it, because he has to lose a time in order to retire the rook.",
        "20... Rd7": "Ok, now... how to go on? The \"logical\" one was b2-b3. But I feared some problems with the black a pawn. Beside, with b2-b3 he could castle, and this will give him some peace, so I played more aggressively. But was I right? \nHe cannot castle, this is for sure!",
        "21. Rg4 Na4": "Now, b2-b3 is not possible, because of Nc3. But I had more tricks on my sleeve!",
        "22. Ke2": "If Nxb3, Rb1 and he must lose his knignt due to b8 ...\nNow... can I really \"trust\" that? How can I know?",
        "22... Rh5 23. h4 Kf8": "This is a mistake, I think. He just wanted to get his king to h7, but it is too large a journey.",
        "24. f4": "Typical comments I would expect to read on a \"professional\" review: \n\"Solidifying the central pawns\" / \"Trapping the bishop with his own pieces\".\nBoth are \"true\", but none makes real sense to me, they just \"sound good\" :-)\nAnd probably a better plan was Kf3, and if Rd3, Ke4 etc. \n",
        "24... Kg8 25. Bf6": "Thank you for helping me get my bishop to a stronger position... :-)",
        "25... g6": "Note that the chessmate still exists with the rook in h8, so he cannot take the b2 pawn.",
        "26. Rg5": "Now he CAN take b2. Rb1 doesn't work because of Rxh4, and I cannot take the knight because of Rh2 . \nI didn't see that the previous is WRONG. He still cannot take the b2 pawn, as after Rxh4, I play Rg2! and nothing can save him from losing a piece and more defending from mate in b8-h8.\nNow, I realized it afterwards, thanks to somebody else. Thanks a lot, and what a shame...\nSo, my intention to change rooks and then take advantage of the open and free g column, thinking I will eventually take the black h5 pawn, and using my a4 pawn to win, was unnecessary. ",
        "26... Nxb2 27. Rxh5": "Rh-g1 was the best option. If black defends by RxR, hxR and then Rh1 threats mate again... And if black defends Rh6, h5 will smash him some way or another. ",
        "27... gxh5 28. Rc1": "Staying calm...\nThe g1 check is wotrthless. To be able to say that, I spent a lot of time analyzing variants such Rg1 , Kh7. 29. Rg5, Kh6. It comes to a stall, so I explored 30. f5, d6xef5, 31. Rxf5. But... then? \nLooking for the a or b column with my rook is worthless, since the black king escapes through white squares... unless my king or central pawns can stop it!\nIt wouldn't have happened if I didn't exchange rooks, so 27. RxR was a mistake!",
        "28... Kh7 29. Rc2 Na4 30. Kf3": "Taking away my king from the second row, I have a time more in order to make something on the g column.\nMy position is very delicate, due to the weak pawns on the a and c columns. Still, rook g2 can give me something, in addition to my king. But I must accept the penetration of his rook on my field...",
        "30... Rd1 31. Rg2 Rd7": "This is incoherent. Yes, he loses the f7 pawn if he doesn't play it, but in the meanwhile he can do much harm on my a and c pawn, and I calculated a lot of variants in which he threats me with his c pawn. My advance of the central pawn, even without f7, is slower. Is this correct?",
        "32. Rg5": "The check is now useless.",
        "32... Kh6 33. Bg7+": "Ok. Kh7 is forced. Then, I considered Bf8, in order to take c5 if he moves his knight. And if he plays Re8, I give check with Rxh5 . Now, if Kg8, Be7 and I win. But if Kg6, Rh8. He must act quickly, so he plays f6 (or f5) in order to get his king closer and take my bishop. Then I take in f6, and if he does Kf7, Rh7  and he cannot take the bishop because of Rh8 , and his rook is lost (and the game also, if I am right). \nIf he takes f6 instead of the bishop, Re7  and he must exchange rooks, then Bxc7 must win (almost sure).\nThe best for him is Kg8, but even so, Be7. If he exchanges rooks, he won't be able, I think, to both stop my pawns and make the c pawn a menace. \nOn the other side, the rook cannot leave the 8 row because of f7  and promotes, and if the rook goes elsewhere (say b8), I have again f7 , exchange rooks and then a winning endgame, or Rg8 , Kh8 and Rg5 (say), and in order to stop my pawn from get to the 8\ufffd, he must use the knight: Kb6. Then f7, Nd7, and I should win because black is almost in zugwang. \nALL this I foresaw (whew!), but...",
        "33... Kh7 34. Bf8": "As planned.",
        "34... Nb2": "...! Back to thinking hard. However...",
        "35. Rxh5+": "Again, Kg6 would have won, because of similar themes than in the previous analysis. ",
        "35... Kg8": "...he avoided the trap. ",
        "36. Bxc5": "Now, the bishop can go to d4, and black is \"blocked\" (this is not right, I realized later), even taking the c4 pawn. My king is free to give support to the pawns.",
        "36... Nxc4 37. Bd4 Na5": "Ok, now he threats Nc6, and I can answer Ke4. \nBut, again, I had one of my \"ideas\". ",
        "38. f5": "With the idea: 38... e6xf5, 39 e5-e6, f7xe6, 40. Rh8 , Kf7. 41. Rh7 , Ke8. 42. RxR, KxR. 43. h4-h5, Nc6. 44  Bf6,  Ke8 (if Ne7 45. BxN, KxB, and by forcing the black king into h8 in order to capture the pawn, white wins, or maybe 45. Kf4 first, Ke8, 46. Kg5 and white still wins). 45. Kf4 and it goes more or less as before.\nBut such analysis are very risky... it takes so much to be sure of them, that I tend not to consider other choices on the very first moves of them, as...\n\n",
        "38... Nb7": "...! Now he sets the menace c7-c5... and I have to start again thinking! Now, I was really tired (even for a correspondence game!). I just could think that I didn't want to \"free\" his king with f5xd6, and stay with two doubled pawns... the entire game was falling over me! \nNow: was the previous move a mistake?",
        "39. f6 c5 40. Bc3 Rd3 41. Be1": "My bishop is in danger, as my a2 pawn... \nWho will win? Was I lost or not? Where was my mistake?\n\nI have two threats: Bishop g3, f4, h6, g7 and mate. But they are a lot of moves. \nRg5 , then Rg7, blocking his knight in order to defend f7. Are they enough?"
