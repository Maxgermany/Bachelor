        "11... Nc2+ 12. Ke2 Nxa1 13. Nc3": "The houdini chess engine thinks that Qd3 is the better move.  He should not fear Qxa2 because of Qb5+ Kc8 (Kc7 Nc5!) (Kd8?, Ne5! dxe5 Nc5!), Be3 Qa6, Rc1+ Kd8, Qxa6 bxa6, Rxa1.\n",
        "13... g6": "Qa6+ was slightly better.\n",

        "20... Qb6 21. Be3": "Now if Qa6, Rc7+ is strong.  Then if Ke8 (Kd8, Bg5+), Rxg7 with threats of both Nxd6+ and Nc7+.  If Kg8 then Bh6 is strong.\n",
