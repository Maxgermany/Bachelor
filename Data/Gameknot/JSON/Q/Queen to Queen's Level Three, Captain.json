        "9. O-O-O": "Castling long to both maintain the tension on black's pieces as well as connecting the rooks.  White also has queen and rook on the same file with this move.",

        "10. Bxc6": "Black made a push with the a-pawn before considering king safety and white presses to explode open the tension...",

        "14... Bxd6 15. Nxe6": "Black can't castle through check and he resigns. (edit 8/30 - You are correct that black's choices are sub par.  The point is black may consider castling if at all possible and losing the queen, instead of the devastating attack you mentioned with his king stuck in the middle.  He doesn't even have that option, and either way the position is bad for black.)"
