        "25... fxg6 26. Qxg6": "I've whittled the kings defences down and my position is strong, now i need to figure out how to deal the killing blow...",
        "26... Nf6 27. Nde7": "I spent a while trying to figure out which knight to secrete here, Nfe7 would have had the added bonus of covering the pawn on e4 with my queen but would relinquish  the grip I held on the g7 and would allow the rook to escape so....",
