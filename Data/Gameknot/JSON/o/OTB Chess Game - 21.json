This game, on the contrary, was my best game, ever.  I only managed to play a game like this once.",
        "1... e5": "He decides to do the King's Pawn play, but that is ok with me.",
        "2. Qf3": "I decide to bring my queen into play immediately because it is based on the setup from my game against Pat.",
        "2... Nc6": "He brings his knight out, on the wrong side.  It should have been on the king's, as opposed to the queen's side.",
        "3. Bc4": "Now, I bring out the bishop in my attempt to find a mating pattern. ",
        "3... Nd4": "I actually thought that he would play f3 or bring his knight out on the kings side in order to avoid this trick, but that does not happen.  Instead, he threatens to capture my pawn and play a fork against me between the rook and king with Nxc2, but I no longer care.  That is because I now have an inevitable mating pattern and will mate him in one move with Qxf7#. ",
        "4. Qxf7#": "He just got beat by someone who learned from Pat Riley.  This happened about 8-10 years ago, before I knew about Gameknot or Jack Stockel and was the second time that I had won a chess game.  "
