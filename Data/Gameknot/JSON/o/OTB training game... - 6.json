        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4": "theory dictates Bc5, c3, Nf6, d4, etcetera, leading to some breed of the Italian party: this opening is usually - providing sound play from both players - not leading to very much; so I decided to go about this differently...",
        "3... Nd4": "a rather innocent move: after Nxd4, exd4, we live on happily ever after; but White spots an attack: so he thinks...",
        "4. Nxe5": "rook in the pocket for White, after Nxf7: so it seems...",
        "4... Qg5": "but this changes things a bit: a crossfire on e5 and g2...",
        "5. Nxf7": "also attacking Qg5...",
        "5... Qxg2 6. Rf1": "forced: losing the rook means mate...",
        "6... Nf3+ 7. Ke2 d5": "releasing Bc8...",
        "8. Bxd5 Nxh2": "a very versatile move...",
        "9. Rg1": "what else?",
        "9... Bg4+": "an eye for an eye...",
        "10. Ke3 Bxd1 11. Rxg2 Nf3 12. Nxh8": "time to collect the prize, says White: but now it's Blacks' turn again...",
        "12... Bc5+ 13. Kd3": "only move...",
        "13... O-O-O": "forcing the Black King into a deadly pin...",
        "14. Nf7": "salvaging the Knight, before it's too late...",
        "14... Rd7 15. Ng5 c6": "our insurance, for the future...",
        "16. Nxf3": "here White first played Nc3: at a quick glance, a very sound development move: but after Ne5+, it is suddenly a choked mate; so White played this...",
        "16... Bxf3 17. Rg3": "White retaliates...",
        "17... cxd5 18. Rxf3": "the beginning of the end...",
        "18... dxe4+ 19. Kxe4 Nf6+ 20. Ke5": "after long and careful thought, White came up with this: it is hard to find a better one, because Black will have it his way in any variation...",
        "20... Ng4+ 21. Kf5 Nxf2": "at this point, Black is a full rook behind: but the sorry bunch on the other side of the board leaves much to desire...",
        "22. Nc3": "development, long overdue...",
        "22... Rf7+": "but White missed this: Nf2 is blocking the King away from covering Rf3...",
        "23. Ke6 Rxf3": "settling the score...",
        "24. Na4": "White needs to find ways to develop...",
        "24... Rf6+ 25. Kd5 b6 26. c3 Nd3": "just in time to prevent d4...",
        "27. Ke4": "White needs to get out of this spot...",
        "27... Rd6 28. b4 Bf2 29. Bb2": "a costly way to develop, but White has to do something...",
        "29... Nxb2 30. Nxb2 Rxd2 31. Na4 Kd7 32. Rh1 h6 33. Rh2 Rxa2": "we are reaching the end of the attack: time to make the most of it...",
        "34. Kf3 Rxa4 35. Rxf2": "safer this way: after Kxf2, Ra2+, Black can trade the rooks at his leasure in a won position or just outplay the White rook...",
        "35... a5": "losing no time: Black needs to make the most of his pawn advantage...",
        "36. bxa5 Rxa5": "better than bxa5: we are still looking for ways to trade rooks...",
        "37. Kg4 Rc5 38. Rf3 Ke6": "Rf7+ is in the air: time to protect the little ones...",
        "39. Re3+ Kf6 40. Rf3+ Kg6 41. Rf4": "blocking Rc4+: but this move will backfire...",
        "41... h5+ 42. Kh4 Rxc3 43. Rb4": "a last attempt...",
        "43... Rc6": "White is in zugzwang: there is no way, to keep the b6 from promotion and prevent mate at the same time; so he resigned..."
