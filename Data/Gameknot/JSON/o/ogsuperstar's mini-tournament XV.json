        "1. d4": "As always, my standard.",
        "1... d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. cxd5": "Seeking to mix it up right away.",
        "3... Nxd5 4. Nc3 g6": "A little unorthadox, I think, but by no means bad.",
        "5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3": "A nice central pawn structure.",
        "6... Bg7 7. Bd3": "At this point, the beginnings of an idea to attack what I assume will be black's castled position arise.",
        "7... O-O 8. h3": "To restrict black's light squared bishop (which at this stage I'm a little scared of as it is still very strong.",
        "8... Bd7": "? This move just \"feels\" wrong. I would have expected b6 or Nc6 at this point.",
        "9. e5": "Opening the way for white's light squared bishop, and further restricting black's dark squared one.",
        "9... c6": "Another questionable move. Black has just effectively retarded his Nb8.",
        "10. Nf3 f6": "I'm guessing my opponent started feeling the walls closing in on his position and wanted to open things up. This pawn move just weakened the squares around his king even further.",
        "11. O-O fxe5 12. Nxe5 Bxe5 13. dxe5": "And now the race is on. Can black get his pieces over to defend in time?",
        "13... Qc7": "With the idea of a pawn grab, but notice that black has a knight with only one available square to move to (which is weak at best) and a rook that couldn't move even if it were on fire.",
        "14. f4": "Activating the strength of white's Rf1 and preparing for a pawn storm.",
        "14... c5": "Black finally opens up a space for his knight.",
        "15. Bb2": "Delivering a check by Bc4 or Qb3 would simply be a waste of time here. With Bb2, white now threatens to OWN the dark squares around black's king.",
        "15... Rd8": "Possibly thinking of a discovered attack on white's queen. The problem is.......",
        "16. Qc2": "......by thinking that \"forcing\" her to move, the resulting square of destination for white's queen actually bolsters white's attack further.",
        "16... Kg7": "? I have no idea what that was about.  Black's king has better be wearing Kevlar.",
        "17. c4": "Seeking to win a bishop while delivering a check by playing e6.",
        "17... Be6 18. f5": "And the fireworks begin. White is now preparing to throw everything including the kitchen sink towards black's king.",
        "18... Rxd3": "Realizing what is about to happen, black attempts pre-emptive action with a rook sac.",
        "19. Qxd3 Bxf5": "While attacks of this nature on the enemy queen look good....................",
        "20. e6+": "...........discovered checks such as this are even prettier:)",
        "20... Kf8": "?? The worst possible square to move to. Black has now just walked right into a pin. Kg8 was far better.",
        "21. g4": "I learned this in \"How to Utilize a Pin 101\".",
        "21... Nc6": "21 moves into the game and black completes development. His challenge now is to hold on and try to weather the storm that is on his horizon.",
        "22. gxf5 g5 23. f6": "As my good friend and teammate webb31620 is fond of saying - \"Passed pawns MUST be pushed\", although I'm sure he stole it from some GM:) Black is now on life support.",
        "23... Ke8": ".......and a bicycle, and a catcher's mitt, and some dolls for my sister. Thanks Santa:)",
        "24. f7+ Kf8 25. Qxh7": "Fully realizing that black can deliver a check, but it will be harmless.",
        "25... Qg3+ 26. Kh1 Rd8 27. Qg8#": "If there is one lesson to be learned from this game, let it be this......The development of minor pieces early is vital for long term plans. Unless your opponent makes an obvious blunder that allows you to maintain a strong attack with only a few pieces, it is always best to station your pieces on active squares early and THEN figure out what you want to do with them. My opponents slow development caused his position to be lost."
