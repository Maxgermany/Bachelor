        "1. e4 c5 2. f4": "nice: returning the favor of a Kings' Gambit like approach, with also specs of a Dutch Defense based attack; which is none other, than the Grand Prix Attack: against the player, who teached me to play this...",
        "2... g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. c3 e6 5. g3": "the theoretical continuation: d4 is to be considered sharper...",
        "5... Ne7 6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O": "this is why I like the Hungarian variation in the Sicilian so much: even against the GPA, we win tempo...",
        "7... d5": "never waste a chance to play d5, in the Sicilian...",
        "8. e5": "better exd5, exd5, d4...",
        "8... h6": "prophylactic: against Ng5...",
        "9. d4 b6": "at this point, d4 has no impact anymore...",
        "10. Be3": "standard move, against c5...",
        "10... c4": "so we get a standard reply...",
        "11. Nbd2": "developing and preparing b3...",
        "11... Nf5 12. Bf2 Nc6 13. b3 b5 14. Qc2": "White finished development...",
        "14... f6": "played in the spur of the moment: we need leverage after g3-g4...",
        "15. h3 a5 16. g4": "and here it is...",
        "16... fxe5": "after gxf5, exf4: Bf2 cannot intervene...",
        "17. dxe5": "so first this one...",
        "17... d4": "introducing a new threat: after gxf5, d3...",
        "18. Qe4 Bb7": "after gxf5, exf5...",
        "19. Nxd4 Nfxd4 20. cxd4 c3": "a bit lucky...",
        "21. Nb1 b4 22. Qxg6": "getting impatient...",
        "22... Qe8 23. Qe4": "leaving White no choice : f4 needs to be covered...",
        "23... a4": "opening up the threat Na5...",
        "24. Qc2": "this seems like a wise move to do...",
        "24... Qd7": "no rocket science involved here: harass d4...",
        "25. Be3": "also, pawn f4 was in a tight spot: making the DSB overburdened...",
        "25... Na5": "time to solve another issue: the matter of the LSB's...",
        "26. Bf3": "understandably, but too slow...",
        "26... Bd5": "Black is delivering one blow after another: this time, b3 is on the menu...",
        "27. bxa4 Nc4": "but this is no way out...",
        "28. Qe2": "no choice left: Be3 cannot move...",
        "28... Rxa4": "time to pick up some spills of war: Black is still two pawns behind...",
        "29. Bxd5 Qxd5": "White needs to untangle his DSB, but not only that: also Nb1 and Ra8 are sorry to look at...",
        "30. Qf3": "trying to find a way to at least utilize the Kings' wing, after trading Queens...",
        "30... Nxe3": "but this spoils it...",
        "31. Qxe3 b3 32. Nxc3 Qxd4 33. Qxd4 Rxd4 34. axb3 Rc8 35. Nb5 Rb4 36. Nd6 Rc3 37. Ra8+ Kh7 38. Nf7": "following the wrong plan: trying to force Rh8 mate, which will not work with Bg7...",

        "40... Kg8 41. Nd8 hxg5 42. Nxe6 gxf4 43. Nxf4 Bxe5 44. Ng2 Rg4": "White has cleared all of Blacks' pawns, but he did not come out unscaved either: he's gotten himself into a nasty pin, with mate perspectives; Blacks' DSB is a real killer...",
        "45. Rh6": "White is also facing a swift mate threat after Rh3, followed by Bd4+ and mate: so that needs attention first; walking out of the pin with Kh1, mates after Rh3+ and Bd4...",
        "45... Rb2": "doubling the attack on the pinned Knight: now after covering for the Knight, with both Rh2 and Rf2, Bd4, the Bishop will capture a Rook...",
        "46. Kh1": "getting out of the pin thus seems safest: the Knight cannot be saved without running mate...",
        "46... Rgxg2 47. Rg1": "a very clever defense: Black has no tricks...",
        "47... Rg7": "Rxg1+, Kxg1, looks very drawish: now, Black can trade on own terms...",
        "48. Rxg7+": "White has little choice...",
        "48... Kxg7 49. Re6 Bb8 50. Ra6": "at first glance, White can reach a draw here: the Black Rook and Bishop need assistance from the King, in order to be able to mate; and as long the White rook can keep the Black King on the seventh row - or at least keep him away as long as possible - nothing can happen: and there is also the 50-move rule; after 50 moves without a capture, it is a technical draw...",
        "50... Kf7": "this is how it is done: walk towards to Rook...",
        "51. Rh6": "the Rook has to go to the opposite side at one point...",
        "51... Be5": "now, after Bf6, the Rook has to switch again...",
        "52. Ra6 Bf6": "and the Black King can advance, under cover of the Bishop: it took a while, but Black finally won this..."
