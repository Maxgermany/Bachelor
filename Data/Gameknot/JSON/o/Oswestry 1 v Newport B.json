        "1. e4": "Stuart Ross (140) from Newport beat me earlier in the season. Last night, I was very lucky, managed to catch him out of form",
        "1... c5": "I play the Sicilian Defence",
        "2. Nf3": "He plays the main line.",
        "2... d6": "Often leading to the Dragon or to the Najdorf variations.",
        "3. d4": "He opts for the open variation.",
        "3... cxd4": "I take.",
        "4. Nxd4": "He takes back.",
        "4... Nf6": "I attack his e pawn.",
        "5. Nc3": "He defends it",
        "5... Nc6": "This is the main line - as opposed to The Dragon variation with 5...g6 or the Najdorf with 5....a6",
        "6. Bg5": "This is the Richter-Rauzer Attack (B63) against the Sicilian.",
        "6... e6": "The recommended move, although others are possible.",
        "7. Qd2": "Preparing to castle.",
        "7... a6": "Preventing a knight from coming in on b5 and also preparing ....b7-b5 myself.",
        "8. O-O-O": "Castles",
        "8... Bd7": "Of course I have to protect my Nc6 before playing b7-b5",
        "9. f4": "White is adopting quite an aggressive set-up.",
        "9... Be7": " continue to develop.",
        "10. Bc4": "But this is highly unusual. Nf3, Be2 or Kb1 are more usual. The drawback with 10.Bc4 is that it means I can play b7-b5 with tempo.",
        "10... b5": "So I attack his bishop. Now there are two Gameknot games from this position, both black wins. 11. Ndxb5 was tried in josefmartin (1518) vs. banora (1972) and Nxc6 in ancientart5 (1708) vs. menchy (2519). My opponent tries something else.\n",
        "11. Nxc6": "This was actually the first choice of Fritz. Fritz finally settles on 11. Bb3 with slight advantage to black.",
        "11... Bxc6": "I take back.",
        "12. Bxf6": "Fritz thinks this is now best for White.",
        "12... gxf6": "Fritz prefers capturing with the bishop. I thought it better to keep the bishop on e7. I am planning to play b5-b4 and d6-d4 and from e7 the bishop will protect my pawn on b4. so there is logic to my move, even if Fritz doesn't agree with it!",
        "13. Bd3": "Fritz gives this as best.",
        "13... b4": "So I hit the knight.",
        "14. Ne2": "Again, Fritz likes this move.",
        "14... d5": "And this one.",
        "15. Nd4": "Fritz prefers Ng3, protecting e4 and keeping the central tension. I hadn't really seen this move - I wrongly thought that white had to do something about the threat of d5xe4",
        "15... Bb7": "So my bishop retreats.",
        "16. e5": "This natural attacking move is a tactical mistake. Fritz likes 16. Qe2 instead, with equality.",
        "16... fxe5": "I played this very quickly - perhaps my opponent now saw the mistake - if 17. fxe5 Bg5! wins the white queen. Unable to recapture, he treats the knight.",
        "17. Ne2": "But to the wrong square! 17. Nb3 was needed. I would guess the rationale for Ne2 was to protect the pawn on f4, but the move contains a fatal flaw. ",
        "17... e4": "Now he is going to lose his bishop. He will not even have a pawn for it, in fact my two bishops are far stronger than the knight. Fritz puts black at 3.5 ahead. Black threw in the towel. Many thanks for reading, please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!"
