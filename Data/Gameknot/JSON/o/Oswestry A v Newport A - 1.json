        "1. f4": "This was a very lucky win by me!",
        "1... d5": "As far as I can remember, this was the third game between us. I won the first, he won the second and I won this, the third,",
        "2. Nf3": "For him, this is relatively normal. He sometimes opens with 1. b3 or 1. b4.",
        "2... g6": "I decide to fianchetto my bishop.",
        "3. e3": "He prepares to develop his.",
        "3... Bg7": "I complete the fianchetto",
        "4. Be2": "He develops his.",
        "4... Nc6": "With a \"threat\" of e7-e5.",
        "5. d4": "Which he stops.",
        "5... Nh6": "With a plan of f7-f6, Nf7 and e7-e5 in due course, but it is far too slow and white can always hit the black centre with c2-c4. Simply Nf6 is better.",
        "6. h4": "And this is a mistake.",
        "6... Bg4": "Now my bishop can't be attacked by h2-h3",
        "7. c4": "He attacks my centre.",
        "7... e6": "I defend.",
        "8. Nc3": "He attacks again.",
        "8... Qd7": "I prepare to castle.",
        "9. cxd5": "He takes.",
        "9... exd5": "I take back.",
        "10. Qb3": "Attacking d5 and b7",
        "10... O-O-O": "Protecting both.",
        "11. Na4": "Threat 12. Na4-c5",
        "11... Bf8": "To stop the knight. I wasn't sure of this move at the time, but Fritz thinks it best and gives advantage of 0.44 to black.",
        "12. Bd2": "He develops his bishop at last.",
        "12... Nf5": "Fritz also likes this move.",
        "13. Bb5": "I should have played Bxf3 here, but I changed by mind and played....",
        "13... Qe6 14. Bxc6": "Clever move. If I take back with the queen, he has 14. Ne5 Qe6 15. Nxg4. That is not the end of the story - I can then play 15....Ng3 attacking both Rh1 and Ng4, but he has 16. Nf2 meeting 16....Nxh1 with 17. Nxh1 and he has two minor pieces for the rook. I think I can then pick up a pawn, starting with 17....Qg4, but I think in the long run the two minor pieces are better than rook and pawn - besides I am losing my best pieces... Any views dear reader?",
        "14... bxc6": "So I took this way.",
        "15. Ne5": "Attacking my bishop.",
        "15... Ng3": "Defending and attacking.",
        "16. Nd3": "Great move! Now the threat is Nc5 attacking both my queen and threatening mate.",
        "16... Re8": "Giving a flight square to my king, and also in some variations the rook action down the e file is crucial.",
        "17. Nac5": "So the knight comes in.",
        "17... Bxc5": "I take.",
        "18. Nxc5": "He takes back.",
        "18... Qd6": "Now I am threatening both the rook on h1 and the pawn on f4, due to the pin on the e file by my rook.",
        "19. Kf2": "So I have the chance to win the exchange with 19...Nxh1+ 20. Rxh1. But then what? It is hard for me to untangle my pieces. I eventually decided not to take the rook. I was glad when I annotated this, and found that Fritz at first favours 19.....Nxh1 but eventually after thinking for several minutes decides on the move I played....",
        "19... Ne4+": "This move.",
        "20. Nxe4": "He takes.",
        "20... Rxe4": "I take back.",
        "21. Rac1": "He starts ganging up on my queen side weaknesses.",
        "21... h5": "Played to prevent his h pawn advancing. Frizt prefers 21...h6. I was hoping for 22. Bb4? Rxf4!+ with advantage, but he is awake to that.",
        "22. Rc5": "He starts to double rooks on the c file.",
        "22... f6": "I need to break through on the king side.",
        "23. Rhc1": "Threatening c6",
        "23... Bd7": "So my bishop comes back to protect.",
        "24. Qd3": "The queen is about to come in with deadly effect. Fritz now likes 24....Kd8 now with plus 2 to white. What I played is probably the best practical chance.",
        "24... g5": "This advance.",
        "25. Qa6+": "He throws in a check.",
        "25... Kd8": "Of course my king is a sitting duck if it stays on the queen-side. Plus 4.25 to white now, according to Fritz.",
        "26. Rc5xc6": "A fairly obvious exchange sacrifice.",
        "26... Bxc6": "I take.",
        "27. Rxc6": "He takes back.",
        "27... Qe7": "Fritz prefers Qd7, but it is a bit academic, objectively black is lost.",
        "28. Ba5 gxf4": "The best chance. My opponent, not 100% sure that taking on c7 led to a won ending, decided to make everything safe by playing....",
        "29. exf4": "Oops!",
        "29... Rxf4+": "White resigns, it is mate in 2. https://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=218519\nMany thanks for reading. Please rate this annotation on the star system, and leave a comment it two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!"
