        "1... d5": "so this is the only feasable reply...",
        "2. Nf3": "another option is d4, followed by Nc3, and turn this into something very different...",
        "2... g6": "like in most Queens' pawn openings, this is always a safe way for Black...",
        "3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 e6 5. d4 Nf6 6. h3 O-O 7. O-O": "one of many constellations, this opening can spawn...",

        "8. b3": "also for White the way to go: c4 and Bb2...",
        "8... c5 9. dxc5 bxc5 10. Bb2 Bb7": "it is clear, that this opening is all about prolonged symmetry: who is the first, to break it up?",
        "11. g4": "White cannot play c4 or e4 for now, but that was the way to go: this untangles Blacks' opening...",
        "11... Ne4 12. Bxg7": "Ng3 is a threat, so this is forced...",
        "12... Kxg7": "now White has to deal with Ng3...",

        "13... d4": "activating Bb7...",
        "14. c4": "probably best: after dxc3 ep, White can just hold this...",

        "19. e4": "again, Black cannot capture en passant...",
        "19... Rfd8": "but she can threaten d3...",
        "20. Qd3": "stubborn Queen on the other side: this can lead to no good, against a fierce Queen...",
        "20... Nb4 21. axb4 axb4": "this is better than en passant: this opens up lines...",
        "22. Qf1": "given the circumstances, probably best...",

        "28... f6": "which is easily solved for now...",
        "29. Ng3": "a sound reply: also avoiding e5-e4...",
        "29... Qb7": "but not after this...",
        "30. Qxb7": "of course, Qa2 is no option after Qf3: so this is forced...",
