    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "On Thursday evening, for the first time I went one-on-one against a grandmaster in a chess game! I was playing board 1 for Oswestry A and played Keith Arkell who was playing board 1 for Newport A.",
        "1... Nf6": "Keith and his brother Nick arrived late. The match was due to start at 7.30pm. At the request of the Newport captain I delayed starting the clock until 7.45pm.",
        "2. Nf3": "Perhaps as a consequence of this Keith rattled out his first moves.",
        "2... g6": "I start to finachetto my bishop.",
        "3. c4": "He gains more central control.",
        "3... Bg7": "I complete the fianchetto.",
        "4. Nc3": "He prepares e2-e4",
        "4... d5": "I turn it into a Grunfeld Defence.",
        "5. cxd5": "He takes.",
        "5... Nxd5": "I take back. I was rather expecting him to turn it into a modern way of handling the exchange variation with 6. e2-4.",
        "6. g3": "But he plays this, which was new to me.",
        "6... O-O": "I castle",
        "7. Bg2": "He completes his fianchetto.",
        "7... c5": "The thematic attack on the centre.",
        "8. O-O": "He castles.",
        "8... Nc6": "I continue to develop.",
        "9. Nxd5": "He takes",
        "9... Qxd5": "I take back.",
        "10. Be3": "He wants to play Ne5 discovering an attack on my queen. ",
        "10... c4": "Although this reduces the pressure on the white centre, This is quite playable.",
        "11. Ne5": "So he comes in with the discovered attack, as in Splosnov, Sergei (2367) vs. Votava, Jan (2505).",
        "11... Qb5": "The queen needs to protect c4 and c6",
        "12. Nxc6": "He takes.",
        "12... bxc6": "I take back.",
        "13. b3": "Still following Splosnov, Sergei (2367) vs. Votava, Jan (2505).",
        "13... Be6": "And this is what Jan Votava(2505) played too.",
        "14. Rc1": "But here we depart company. Sergei Splosnov(2367) preferred b3xc4 immediately.",
        "14... Rac8": "Although this move is not exactly bad, moving the a8 rook away from possible attack from Bg2 is a good idea, and so is protecting c6, as I am now threatening c4xb3, after the game Keith suggested Ra-d8 as being even stronger. Fritz likes Ra-b8 here.",
        "15. bxc4": "Now that c6 is protected this is virtually forced, as I was threatening c4xb3.",
        "15... Bxc4": "So I take back, threatening e2.",
        "16. a4": "He hits my queen.",
        "16... Qa6": "I drop back, keeping the pressure on e2.",
        "17. Re1": "He protects e2.",
        "17... Rfd8": "And I am happy with my position. Knights are exchanged, all my pieces are developed to reasonable squares. My c6 is weak, but it should not be terminal.",
        "18. Qc2": "Attacking my bishop. Fritz puts white up at 0.15 - hardly anything.",
        "18... Bd5": "I considered Be6 but it is even better to challenge his Bg2.",
        "19. Red1": "He improves the position of his Re1.",
        "19... Bxg2": "I take his powerful bishop off.",
        "20. Kxg2": "He takes back.",
        "20... Rd5": "I threaten Ra5 attacking a4.",
        "21. Rd3": "He prepares for that.",
        "21... Rcd8": "Keith thought this move was a minor mistake. Fritz thinks it is best however. I thought I was getting rid of my weak pawn and leading to more exchanges. I was rather thinking I was getting near a drawable ending here.",
        "22. Qxc6": "So he takes.",
        "22... Qxc6": "I take back.",
        "23. Rxc6": "He takes.",
        "23... Bxd4": "I take.",
        "24. Rc7": "This was the move I missed on move 21. I ws expecting exchanges on d4.",
        "24... Bxe3": "We wondered afterwards if there were improvements on this move, but Fritz thinks it is best. Fritz gives white an advantage of plus 1 now.",
        "25. Rxe3": "He takes back, attacking e7 and a7.",
        "25... Rd8d7": "When I played my last move, I thought this defended both pawns. When I saw this position on the board, I saw what was coming...",
        "26. Rxe7": "This!",
        "26... Rxe7": "So I take.",
        "27. Rxe7": "He takes back.",
        "27... Ra5": "I attack his a pawn.",
        "28. Re4": "He defends.",
        "28... f5": "This is probably a mistake. Fritz prefers Kg7. White's advantage goes up from plus 1 to plus 1.25 according to Fritz.",
        "29. Rd4": "The best square.",
        "29... Kf7": "I activate my king.",
        "30. g4": "I think he wanted me to exchange, leaving him with a passed e pawn.",
        "30... Kf6": "But I refuse. Fritz prefers taking, and gives white as only up 0.58.",
        "31. gxf5": "He takes.",
        "31... gxf5": "I took this way - again to stop him from having a passed e pawn. Fritz prefers taking with the king and now gives white as up 1.01.",
        "32. Kg3": "He advances his king.",
        "32... Kg5": "As do I.",
        "33. h4+": "He checks.",
        "33... Kh5": "I played this to prevent any further advance of this pawn. Fritz prefers Kf6 and gives white as up 1.29 now.",
        "34. e3": "I think this is a bit of a waiting move, quietly improving his position.",
        "34... h6": "Fritz prefers Rc5.",
        "35. Rc4": "Another waiting move.",
        "35... Ra6": "And the same from me.",
        "36. Rc5": "Heading for a pawn exchange.",
        "36... Rxa4": "I take.",
        "37. Rxf5+": "He takes.",
        "37... Kg6": "Forced!",
        "38. Rc5": "Rook returns to c5.",
        "38... a5": "\"Passed pawns must be pushed\"! Fritz says white is up 1.19 now.",
        "39. h5+": "White throws in a check.",
        "39... Kg7": "King drops back. Although he had started about 20 minutes behind me, I think I had used more time that him now, but neither of us were in any time trouble.",
        "40. Rc6": "Rooks stops my king from advancing.",
        "40... Ra1": "This seemed to me to be the natural move, but Fritz prefers Rb4 with an advantage of only 1.01 to white.",
        "41. Rg6+": "But now +1.20",
        "41... Kh7": "Forced, if I want to keep my h pawn.",

        "44... a3": "I carry on advancing.",
        "45. Kf5": "His king carries on advancing. Fritz gives white as up 2.58 now.",
        "45... a2": "Keith wondered if this may be a mistake too, as it stops my rook marking time with R8-a7-a8 and also maybe playing Ra7 and exchanging the a pawn for his f pawn.",
        "46. Kf6": "I think the game is lost now, and I will show you the final moves without further comments.",
        "46... Kh8 47. Ra4 Kh7 48. Ra8 Rh1 49. Rxa2 Rxh5 50. f4 Rh1 51. Ra7+ Kg8 52. Kg6 Kf8 53. f5 Rh3 54. Ra8+ Ke7 55. f6+ Ke6 56. Re8+": "And black resigns. Keith said afterwards \" You certainly did give a good account of yourself in our game. It could easily have been played between 2 GMs, or a GM and an IM, and were it on ''Chessbomb'', for example, there would be very few 'red' moves.\" Many thanks for reading.
