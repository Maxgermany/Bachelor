        "20... Qxb6": "Black must take with his queen!",
        "21. Qxc8+": "But it doesn\u00b4t help Black! Mate in one, can you see it?",
        "21... Qb8": "Desperation!",
        "22. Qxb8#": "I only takes the queen and now checkmate!\nImmediately after I finished this amazing game I thinked, I must annotate this game! As I can see, Black castled in the wrong direction, if he had castled kingside I think it had been a whole different story!"
