        "1. e4": "Another game versus one of my co-workers, Ian.  I begin with my usual e4!",
        "1... e5 2. Bc4": "I have recently began to like this move more and more.  It feels strong in the center.",
        "2... Nh6": "I have never been a big fan of the N on the edge of the board.",
        "3. d4 d6 4. Bxh6": "here is why the N should never be allowed on h6.  Now the king side pawn structure is ruined and there's doubled pawns on the H-file.",
        "4... gxh6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. d5": "I had to make a tough decision here, I didn't want to block my N and my light bishop, but I didn't like the exchange problem imposed by his B on g7.",
        "6... c6": "Now he made my choice easy opening up the d5 square like I wanted.",
        "7. dxc6 Nxc6": "they always say take with the piece worth less.  this move allows me to advance my N, as opposed to if he had taken with the pawn I would've been stuck.",
        "8. Qf3": "figured I'd try for a quick mate on f7.",
        "8... Qc7": "spoiled",
        "9. Nd5": "here's the N move that would've been blocked if he'd taken with the pawn.",
        "9... Qd7 10. Nf6+": "Here I know that he must take with the bishop, and I'm then his rook and pawn are en prise.  So I will at least win a pawn.",
        "10... Bxf6 11. Qxf6 Rf8 12. Qxh6": "Worked exactly how predicted.",
        "12... Nd4": "Once he made this move I noticed an opportunity to trap his queen if he forks my rook.  Can you see it without looking ahead?",
        "13. a4": "Setting up the trap.",
        "13... Nxc2+ 14. Kd1": "I go ahead and attack leaving him with less options.",
        "14... Nxa1 15. Bb5": "trap sprung!  Now the Q is trapped.",
        "15... a5 16. Bxd7+ Bxd7 17. Qxd6 Rd8": "An evil little plot by my friend, if he bxp then my queen is up the creek...",
        "18. Qxe5+ Be6+ 19. Ke2": "Here I knew I would have to come up a rank anyways to free my rook, so I go ahead and take the liberty here. ",
        "19... b6 20. b3": "A dubious move, just checking to see if I could check and take his N...ya never know unless you try. :)",
        "20... Nxb3 21. Qb5+ Rd7": "He did good and kept his bishop on guard.",
        "22. Nf3": "N move to keep the forking from happening.",
        "22... f6 23. Qxb6 Rff7": "His first REAL blunder.  Leaving the bishop unprotected. The Queen trap earlier wasn't necessarily a blunder, just a technical oversight. ",
        "24. Qxe6+ Kf8 25. Qxb3 Rdb7 26. Qd5 Rb2+ 27. Nd2": "After the loss of his bishop and knight, he decides there's no need to advance this game any further. "
