        "3. h3 Nf6 4. Bb5+": "This move is actually somewhat promising for black, though the move tree is pretty sparse this far down.  We anticipate black will move Pc6, permitting the queen egress.",
        "4... c6 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3 Be6 7. Nc3": "Here I am partial to BxBe6, which doubles black's pawns.  Not that that is a big thing, but it makes Ng5 nice.",
        "7... Nbd7 8. d3": "This will prove a good solid move.  I still like BxBe6 to prevent black doubling white's pawns.  Maybe I get too hung up on pawn doubling.  It isn't that big an advantage.",
        "8... Nc5 9. O-O d5": "Black withdraws cover for Pe5.  NxPe5 looks real good.",
        "10. d4 exd4 11. Ne2 Nfxe4 12. Nexd4 Qf6 13. Be3": "Nf3 was covering Nd4.  I would move Re1 here.  Even better, NxPc6.  You can't do NxPc6 after Be3, since Bc1 protects against QxPb2.",
        "13... a5": "Actually, NxPc6 still looks good, followed with BxPd5 unless black attacks Nc6.  The white queen is covering BxPd5.",
        "14. Nxc6": "Yay!",
        "14... Qxb2": "And here the game came to an unfortunate conclusion.  BxPd5 would have given white lots of sweet options.\n"
