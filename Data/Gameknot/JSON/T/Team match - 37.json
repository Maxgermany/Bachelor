        "1. e4 h5": "Unusual.  There was an opening I read in a chess magazine years back called \"Crustacean.\"  Of course, one does NOT deploy the rooks in this opening.  Whenever I see this pawn move I play d3 or d4, just in case, though.",
        "2. Nc3 c6 3. Bc4 e6 4. d3 b5 5. Bb3 Bb4 6. Bd2 Bxc3 7. Bxc3 Qe7 8. Nf3 f6 9. Qe2 b4 10. Bd2 a5 11. c3 e5 12. h3 Ba6 13. cxb4 axb4 14. O-O Qd6": "Here white does not have enough power on d3.  Bc4 will protect it, and black has no pawn easily available to push the white bishop.  However, white sacrifices tempo, letting black make the aggressive moves.  14. O-O castling may have done that.",
        "15. Bc4 c5 16. Bxa6 Rxa6 17. Nh4 Ne7 18. Be3 g5 19. Nf3": "I like Nf5 better, I think.  Sure white may double pawns if black trades knights.  Looks like black is going to mess up white's castle pawns either way, though.",
        "19... g4 20. hxg4 hxg4 21. Nh2 f5 22. exf5": "Mm, that pawn was blocking Pe5.  With e4 black threatens a quick end to this game.",
        "22... Nxf5 23. Qxg4 Qxd3 24. Bxc5 Nc6 25. Qg6+ Kd8 26. Qf6+": "Nice move, forking king and rook.",
        "26... Nce7 27. Qxh8+ Kc7 28. Qxe5+": "While clever, black's obvious response is a pawn fork of the white queen and bishop, and white's move after that loses the bishop.",
        "28... d6 29. Bxd6+ Rxd6 30. Rac1+ Kb8 31. Qb5+": "Oops.  White got in a big hurry.  Qh8+ would probably be answered by Rd8.  Qa5 creates possibilities also, threatening Pb4 and permitting Rc7 to strike fear into the black king.\n",
        "31... Qxb5": "White is only down 4 and has (essentially) three passed pawns.  It isn't completely hopeless, just much more bleak."
