        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6": "The king's indian defence. I've recently started playing d4 in most of my games as white and this opening sequence seems to be the most popular response on gameknot. It usually provides a tough and tactical game which is probably why I've lost so many of my recent games as white!!",
        "3. g3 c6": "Stopping pressure on b7 and preparing a counter attack in the centre.",
        "4. Bg2 d5 5. cxd5": "\"5.Qb3 maintains more tension\". -- Fischer",
        "5... cxd5 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. e3 O-O 8. Nge2 Nc6 9. O-O b6 10. b3": "\"It's hard for either side to introduce an imbalance into this essentially symmetrical variation. Deadeye equality also ensues afer 10.Nf4 e6 11.b3 Ba6 12.Re1 Rc8 13.Ba3 Re8 14.Rc1 \"(Stahlberg-Flohr, Kemeri 1937) -- Fischer",
        "10... Ba6 11. Ba3": "\"After White's 11th move I should adjudicate his position as slightly superior, and at worst completely safe. To turn this into a mating position in eleven more moves is more witchcraft than chess! Quite honestly, I do not see the man who can stop Bobby at this time\". -- K.F. Kirby, South African Chess Quarterly",
        "11... Re8 12. Qd2 e5": "! \"I was a bit worried about weakening my QP, but felt that the tremendous activity obtained by my minor pieces would permit White no time to exploit it. 12...e6 would probably lead to a draw\". -- Fischer",
        "13. dxe5 Nxe5 14. Rfd1": "\"Add another to those melancholy case histories entitled: The Wrong Rook.\" -- Fischer ~ \"This is very much a case of 'the wrong rook'. One can understand Byrne's desire to break the pin on the e2-knight, but this turns out to be less important than other considerations. Fischer spends a lot of time and energy analysing the superior 14. Rad1!, but still comes to the conclusion that Black can keep the advantage.\" -- John Nunn. As is so often quoted in deciding which rook to move one should consider the best possible opportunites and lines of attack for which rook to move, decide which is best and then move the other one!!",
        "14... Nd3": "\"Now it's all systems go for the Fischer rocket\". -- Robert Wade",
        "15. Qc2": "\"There is hardly any other defense to the threat of ...Ne4\". -- Fischer",
        "15... Nxf2": "! \"The key to Black's previous play. The complete justification for this sac does not become apparent until White resigns!\" -- Fischer",
        "16. Kxf2 Ng4+ 17. Kg1 Nxe3 18. Qd2": "Byrne: \"As I sat pondering why Fischer would choose such a line, because it was so obviously lost for Black, there suddenly comes..\"",
        "18... Nxg2": " !! \"This dazzling move came as the shocker... the culminating combination is of such depth that, even at the very moment at which I resigned, both grandmasters who were commenting on the play for the spectators in a separate room believed I had a won game!\" -- Robert Byrne",
        "19. Kxg2 d4": "!",
        "20. Nxd4 Bb7+ 21. Kf1": "\"In a room set aside for commentaries on the games in progress, two grandmasters were stating, for the benefit of the spectators, that Byrne had a won game. Byrne's reply to Fischer's next move must have been jaw dropping!\" -- Wade",
        "21... Qd7": "And White resigns. Fischer writes: \"A bitter disappointment. I'd hoped for 22.Qf2 Qh3+ 23.Kg1 Re1+!! 24.Rxe1 Bxd4 with mate to follow shortly.\" For the benefit of others I've added in the last few moves...",
        "22. Qf2 Qh3+ 23. Kg1 Re1+ 24. Rdxe1 Bxd4": "There you have it a masterpiece of witchcraft... Hope you enjoyed it"
