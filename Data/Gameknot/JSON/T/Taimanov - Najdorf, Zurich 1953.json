        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O": "This is a standard KID position in which white usually closes the center with d5. Some times de is played leading to the exhange variation. However, after 7.de de 8.qxq rxq, 9nxe5 is unfavorable, in view of 9..nxe4 10.nxn bxe5, where material is balanced, but black has the stronger position.",
        "7... Nc6 8. d5": "And here, white closes the game. White retains a slight advantage with his extra space. White will usually try for a queenside attack, while black will counter-attack on the kingside, beginning with the ..f7-f5 thrust. White's attack is faster and simpler than black's. However, black's attack is more dangerous, because it is directed right at white's king. Thus, there are chances for both sides. ",
        "8... Ne7 9. Ne1": "White wants to eventually bring this knight to the queenside, a common idea in this position.",
        "9... Nd7": "Preparing the ..f5 break.",
        "10. Be3 f5 11. f3": "Taking the pawn is risky. After 11.ef gf, black has the open g-file, which can become very harmful to white.",
        "11... f4 12. Bf2 g5 13. Nd3": "White's queenside attack usually involves the break c4-c5. Right now, it cannot be accomplished because c5 is defended. Black knows this, but he knows his plan is equally as lethal.",
        "13... Nf6": "Black allows the c5 push in order to bring his knight to the kingside. You shouldn't be afraid to counter-attack with this system. That is the beauty of the KID.",
        "14. c5 Ng6 15. Rc1": "Immediate attacking is not always the best answer. See how each side tries to improve their position before continuing their attacks. You want your pieces on their best squares. It makes the attack much stronger.",
        "15... Rf7 16. Rc2 Bf8": "The idea of fianchettoing  the king's bishop is to provide it with a strong line of attack on the long diagonal. When the game is closed, the bishop's diagonal is closed and in most cases is not reopened. It is by no means weak. It can be used to hold the important backward d5 pawn, and as a tool for an attack.",
        "17. cxd6 cxd6 18. Qd2 g4 19. Rfc1 g3": "! Black sacrifices a pawn in order to open up lines for an attack. Keep watching, and you'll notice that Black continues to slowly improve his position even though hes behind in material. This is the hallmark of a true grandmaster.",
        "20. hxg3 fxg3 21. Bxg3 Nh5 22. Bh2 Be7 23. Nb1": "White opens up the c-file and has plenty of queenside space, but black's kingside initiative grows stronger with every move. White must now focus on his king.",
        "23... Bd7 24. Qe1 Bg5 25. Nd2 Be3+": "! An excellent move. White's darksquare weaknesses have placed him in quite a dangerous spot.",
        "26. Kh1 Qg5 27. Bf1 Raf8": "Once again, black is a pawn down and continues to slowly pile pressure on the kingside. Attackers such as Alekhine, Tal, and Kasparov were excellent at this, improving their positions even when they were a whole piece down. What could their opponents do?",
        "28. Rd1": "White's rook is now free to operate on the c-file. Black is aware of this, and takes some defensive measures on the queenside before continuing his attack.",
        "28... b5 29. a4 a6 30. axb5 axb5 31. Rc7 Rg7": "Black's rook is tied to the defense of the bishop, but it's now on the g-file. Now white must once again get on the defensive. This time, there's no turning back.",
        "32. Nb3 Nh4 33. Rc2": "White needs to hold his 2nd rank.  Black missed a quick win here with 33..Rxf3!! If 34.gf, then 34..qg1  35.bxq rxq  36.kh2 nf3# If 34.qe2 ng3  35.bxn rxb, Rh3  check is threatened, with qg1# to follow.But in either case, black has a clear win.",
        "33... Bh3": "! Beautiful. Every single one of black's pieces are on the kingside, and each one is highly dangerous. Black's numerical superiority proves decisive. His earlier pawn sacrifice has allowed him to create unstoppable threats along the g-file.\nOf course not 34.gh?? 34..qg1!! mates in 3. ",
        "34. Qe2": "White must give up his queen.",
        "34... Nxg2 35. Bxg2 Bxg2+ 36. Qxg2 Qh4": "ng3 is threatened. White's next move is forced.",
        "37. Qxg7+ Kxg7": "White has a rook and a piece for his queen. Material wise, white is not so far behind, but this does not matter here. Black's attack continues.",
        "38. Rg2+ Kh8 39. Ne1 Nf4 40. Rg3": "White tried to hold the rook, but he can't.",
        "40... Bf2 41. Rg4 Qh3 42. Nd2 h5 43. Rg5": "White resigns. 43..qh4 wins. Here is a sample variation.",
        "43... Qh4 44. Rg1": "Any other rook move loses the rook or the knight on e1.",
        "44... Bxg1 45. Kxg1 Rg8+ 46. Ng2": "46.Kf1 also loses. \n",
        "46... Rxg2+ 47. Kf1 Qf2#": ""
