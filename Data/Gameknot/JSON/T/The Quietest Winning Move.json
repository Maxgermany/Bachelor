        "1. e4": "Team match. I'm playing white.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "Ruy Lopez.",
        "3... d6 4. d4": "3. d6 is the Old Steinitz defense, not a very popular variation for black. 4. d4 is a fairly forceful move. White grabs the center, threatens to win a pawn on e5, and threatens to win the pinned knight with 5. d5.",
        "4... Bd7 5. Nc3": "Without 4. ... Bd7, white could have played 5. Bxc6 bxc6 6. dxe5 dxe5 7. Nxe5 to win a pawn, but now, black responds 5. Bxc6, recapturing with the bishop and therefore is able to play 7. ... Bxe4 regaining the pawn, although that simplified move order endangers the black bishop at e4, so a zwischenzug with 7. ... Qe7 followed by 8. ... Bxe4 is required.",
        "5... Nxd4 6. Bxd7+": "Well, that one isn't in my opening reference even though it seems fairly natural, so white simply goes along with all the exchanges. I hope I didn't miss a clever trap.",
        "6... Qxd7 7. Nxd4 exd4 8. Qxd4": "White seems to have gotten the better of the exchanges, with two pieces developed strongly in the center. White also prevents black from castling by threatening the pawn on a7. ",
        "8... f6 9. O-O Ne7 10. Be3 Nc6 11. Qd2": "Safer than most.",
        "11... Ne5 12. Nd5 c6 13. Nc3": "Changed my mind.",
        "13... Nc4 14. Qe2 Nxe3 15. Qxe3": "Black exchanges knight for bishop.",
        "15... Be7 16. Rad1 O-O 17. Ne2": "Headed for the kingside.",
        "17... Bd8 18. Qb3+": "Wasting time, mostly, but aiming for b4.",
        "18... Kh8 19. Qb4 Be7 20. Ng3": "Black is well-enough bottled up that white is stymied looking for attacks.",
        "20... Rfd8 21. Rd3 a5 22. Qb6 Ra6 23. Qe3": "Still stymied, but I like that black has removed one rook, placing it on a6 where it will do his king no good. It suggests that a kingside attack might be warranted.",
        "23... Qe6 24. a4": "The a2 pawn was en prise, so it runs to a4.",
        "24... Qa2 25. Rb3": "Defends b2 and traps the black queen, inviting black to give white a rook on the 7th rank.",
        "25... Qxa4 26. Rxb7 Bf8 27. Qd3": "I used to like the rook on a6, and now for some reason I chase it back to a8. Maybe 27. Nf5 and 28. Qg3 would have been more fun. Well, at least white can still play those moves.",
        "27... Raa8 28. b3": "Securing black's queen behind a wall of white pawns, shut off from defending her king. I have to give 28. b3! an exclamation point for quietly denying black his queen for the moves to come.",
        "28... Qa3 29. Nf5 g6 30. Qh3": "Threatening mate in 1 on h7.",
        "30... h5 31. Nh4": "The winning move. 31. Nh4! may be the quietest winning move I have played so far. I think Capablanca would probably like this one. Black is thoroughly busted from here. 32. Nxg6+ followed by 33. Qxh5, combined with that powerful rook on the 7th rank, creates a force that black cannot stop.",
        "31... Bg7 32. Nxg6+ Kg8 33. Qxh5": "White now has a forced mate in 4 (it was probably a forced mate in 6 with 31. Nh4! though I didn't work it out then), though black has a couple stalling tactics if he wishes to extend the forced mate a bit longer. White entered the moves from this point as conditional moves.",
        "33... Rab8 34. Ne7+ Kf8 35. Rc7": "35. Rc7 puts an end to that line of stalling. Black cannot threaten this rook again, as playing either ook to c8 allows capture by the white knight with mate in 2 to follow.",
        "35... d5 36. Nf5": "Now 36. ... Qe8 forces white to waste two more moves, effectively stalling a little longer.",
        "36... Kg8 37. Qf7+ Kh8 38. Qxg7#": "Final position."
