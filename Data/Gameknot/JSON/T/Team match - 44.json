        "12. a4 Nc6 13. Ba3 Re8 14. Rb1 Qc7 15. h3 Rad8 16. Re1": "It\u00b4s still kind of even. White are soon ready to the pawn push e4. This move will also make my c4 pawn weak. ",
        "16... Ne4 17. Bxe4 Rxe4": "Because I take back with my e-rook instead of the pawn, I\u00b4m avoiding to isolate and weaken my c-pawn. I also have some vague ideas about starting an attack against Whites castled King in the future. ",
        "18. Qc2 Rde8 19. Ng5": "Now begins the trickiest part of the game, with much threats and counterthreats, and maneuvers back and forth!",

        "23... Be6": "After a long pondering I find this the best move.",
        "24. e5": "This move is not so pleasant for me. White gains space here. Probably better for White was exd5. I can\u00b4t take back with my Bishop, if I do that I loose my e-Rook! White probably missed that!",
        "24... Qc8 25. Bc1 Rh5 26. Qe2 Bf5 27. Rb5": "Threatening my d5-pawn.",
        "27... Qe6": "Combining attack and defense.",
        "28. Ng5 Qg6 29. Rxd5": "Now my d5-pawn falls!",
        "29... h6": "But I can live with that. For now I begin to impose a serious threat against Whites King. ",

        "39. Re4 Rg6": "Threatening disaster along the g-file.",
        "40. Rd8+": "I was here pondering pretty long time, accept or reject the sacrifice? But decides to take it.",
        "40... Qxd8 41. Rxg4": "White wins a Bishop back, but still I\u00b4m up in material.",
