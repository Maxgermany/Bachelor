    "moves": {
        "1. c3 d5 2. Nf3 c5 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nc6": "To this day, I really do not understand why some players avoid the symmetry of recapturing with the pawn.  The alternatives lose time from either Nc6 or e5.  Of course time is not everything, but being able to develop at your opponents expense allows you to take control of the direction of play.",
        "5. Qa4 Bd7": "Anticipating Ne5.",
        "6. e3 a6": "I thought his idea was Bb5.",
        "7. c4 Nf6": "He can create his own square for the bishop.",
        "8. c5 e5 9. Qb3 Rb8 10. e4": "I missed the power of Ng5 here.  What I did see was 10... Nxe4 11.Qxd5.  Should I have tried 10... Nd4 or Be6?  [A]10... Nd4 [A1] 11.Nxd4 exd4 12.exd5 Bxc5 13.Bc4 b5.  White has an isolated queen pawn and the attack has been diffused. [A2] The queen moves and White has to play carefully. [B]10... Be6 11.Ng5 Nd4 with unclear play.",
        "10... dxe4 11. Ng5 Qe7": "The other alternative is Be6, but I thought that if I played the queen move I might be able to avoid 12.Nxe6 fex6 13.Qxe6+.",
        "12. Bc4": "Oddly enough I had dreaded this move, but when I saw it I thought that Be6 would allow him to continue his attack.  For a single pawn, which I was ahead anyway, I might remove the teeth from the attack.",
        "12... b5": "The more I examine here, the more I believe that b5 is a serious Black misstep.  The Black knight on c6 prevents the painful 13.Nxf7 Rg8 14.Nxe5 Nxe5 15.Bxg8, but 13.cxb6 e.p. seems to allow White to pursue the same line only a move later.  Instead 12... Nd5 here, rather than later, puts pressure on White to prove his idea has merit.  Black ends up getting a break when white passes over the en-passant move.",
        "13. Bxf7+ Kd8 14. Be6": "Clever.",
        "14... Bxe6 15. Nxe6+ Kc8 16. Ng5 Qxc5 17. O-O Nd5": "Closing off my kingside to his queen.",
        "18. Qh3+": "Should white have castled and played Rd1 before continuing the attack with Qh3?",
        "18... Kb7 19. Qd7+ Nc7": "Here is where I felt that I had weathered the attack.",
        "20. Ne6": "The other alternative was Nxe4 which I think may have been prudent.  This continued attack is not so fierce as it seems at first sight.  White's main problem is the lack of piece involvement in the attacks.  I think 20.Be3! develops a piece with tempo, but Black is likely to respond to it with the same idea that works so well against 20.Ne6.",
        "20... Qd6": "And Rd1 is met by Qxe6!",
        "21. Nxf8 Qxf8": "Forced, but I can feel the game heading my way.",
        "22. Be3 Rd8 23. Qg4": "Most of Black's moves have been nearly forced for a while now.  Now Black has to look and think what to do to develop his own threats as well as counter the White threats.",
        "23... h5": "Black cannot save the e4 pawn, and White's previous attack provides a counter-play plan.",
        "24. Qxe4 Qf6 25. a4 b4": "Black cannot afford to open the position around his king.",
        "26. a5 Nd5": "This accomplishes two things.  It allows Black the option of exchanging on e3, and it covers Bb6.",
        "27. Nd2": "I overlooked how to deal with the c5 vulnerability.",
        "27... Rd7": "If I had it over to play again, I would play g5.",
        "28. Nb3 Rhd8": "As I said before, I had missed the c5 vulnerability.  I had decided he was not asserting central control, so I would.",
        "29. Nc5+": "As long as not Ka7.  I actually have had decent results on many of the rook-for-knight exchanges.  My advice to anyone who is on the \"bad side\" of this exchange is to find the compensation that the exchange creates.  Here the knight is a valuable attacker, and when it dies, so does the immediate prospects for further white pressure.",
        "29... Kc8 30. Nxd7 Rxd7 31. Rfd1 Nd4": "I realize this move is not great, but defending the d5 knight was going to be a slow crush.  Moving the d5 knight allows an exchange that allows him to seize control of the d file.",
        "32. Bxd4": "I would have played Rc1+ first.",
        "32... exd4 33. Qe8+": "Finally!  Better is Rxd4.",
        "33... Rd8 34. Rac1+ Kb8": "Avoiding the queen check.",
        "35. Qe2": "I think Qc6 is more forcing.  I thought I would lose in the resulting endgame play, so...",
        "35... h4 36. Qc4 h3 37. g3": "In his place, I would play Qc6 or Rxd4.",
        "37... Qf3": "Filling the weakened space with a checkmate threat.",
        "38. Qf1 Rf8": "Offering the h pawn for the f pawn and attacking chances.",
        "39. Rd2": "Either Rxd4 or Qxh3.",
        "39... Nf4": "! The busy knight: Securing the pawn, offering the knight for an attacking lane, and denying d3 for the rook!  40.Rxd4? Ne2+! 41.Qxe7 Qg2#.",
        "40. Rc6": "?",
        "40... d3": "I could seize the offered material, but this move is best exploiting e2.",
        "41. Rb6+ Ka7 42. Rxb4": "Misses the point.",
        "42... Ne2+ 43. Rxe2 dxe2": "And White resigns."
