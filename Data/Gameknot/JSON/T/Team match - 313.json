        "1. d4": "I'm annotating this mainly because of the ending.  According to Gameknot's computer, the end position is +2.14 for Black.  I agreed a draw believing that I couldn't force a win but whether I was right or not, the computer's scoring was nonsensical - it should either have been 0-0 or 100% for Black.",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nf3": "White ducks standard QP Indian/Nimzo type lines that would have resulted from 2. c4 ",
        "2... g6": "I adopt my favourite King's Indian formation anyway.",
        "3. Bf4 d6 4. e3 Bg7 5. Be2 O-O 6. O-O": "Black has a standard King's Indian formation.  White's is a somewhat conservative formation more commonly seen against something like the Slav, I think.",
        "6... Nc6": "I continue my development, developing my N towards the centre.  I often play this N to a6 or d7 in the King's Indian but see no need to avoid the best square in this position.",
        "7. c4 Qe8": "Prepares ...e5",
        "8. a3": "Not quite sure what was in White's mind here...  The computer calls it an inaccuracy. (+0.38 rather than -0.33 for 8. Nc3)",
        "8... e5 9. dxe5 dxe5 10. Nxe5": "White gives up a N.  Not sure why ...  Better was 10. Bg5 according to the computer, which now scores things +2.78 in Black's favour.",
        "10... Nxe5 11. Nc3 Bf5 12. h3 Rd8 13. Nd5": "Another mistake.  Better was 13. Qb3 Ne4 14. Nxe4 Bxe4 15. Rad1 Qc6 16. f3 Bf5 17. Rxd8 Rxd8 18. Rd1 Rxd1+ 19. Qxd1 Bf6 20. Qd5 Kg7 21. b4",

        "15. Bf3": "and now, 15. f3 was better",
        "15... Nxf3+": "The computer evaluates this as +5.32 for Black.",
        "16. Qxf3 Bxb2": "I'm always nervous about making captures like this but it seemed safe enough at the time.  The computer identifies it as a mistake (+2.84 rather than +5.30).",
        "17. Rad1": "and here, the computer reckons 17. Ra2 to be better.",
        "17... Bg7": "Although the B was out on a limb, it was OK where it was.  17... Rfe8 would have maintained my advantage, preventing the next move.",
        "18. e4": "Suddenly White wins the piece back.  My B has nowhere to go.  Needless to say, I should have seen this coming and prepared for it rather than taking on b2.",
        "18... Bxe4": "Not as good as 18...g5, apparently: Best: +2.71 \u00bb \u2026 g5 19. Bxg5 f6 20. Bf4 Bg6 21. Qb3 Qf7 22. Qxb7 Bxe4 23. Qxa7 Rd7 24. Qc5 Bxd5 25. Rfe1 Rfd8 26. a4 f5\n",

        "31. Qxe8+ Qf8 32. Qb5 Qe7 33. Kf1 Kf8 34. f4 Qc5": "? Generally speaking, I believe it's a good principle to exchange when ahead on material, but this is one of those occasions when you have to look further.  Better was 30\u2026 Qe4 35. f5 Qxf5+ 36.

        "48. Kg2 a3": "But this mistake reduces the advantage from +5.15 to +3.52.  Better was \u2026 Qd5+ 49. Kf2 Qf5+ 50. Ke2 Qe4+ 51. Kf2 Qf4+ 52. Kg2 Qxg5+ 53. Kf3 Qf5+ 54. Ke2 Qe5+ 55.

        "49. gxf6+ Kf7 50. h4": "Here, the computer prefers a series of checks, starting with 50. Qa2+, keeping Black's advantage down to +3.55, rather than +5.18 resulting from its preferred response of ...Qd2+ to 50.h4",
        "50... Qxf6": "and here the computer's event horizon produces an interesting variation.  On White's 50. h4, it recommended that Black respond with ...Qd2+ but now it prefers ...Qd5+, with  marginally higher value of +5.21.  I was intent at this stage on eliminating White's counter-chances by getting rid of his annoying f6 pawn, hoping to capitalise on my 2-1 kingside pawn majority, or indeed eliminate White's pawns completely.",
        "51. Qa2+ Kg7 52. Qxa3 Qxh4": "I've achieved that objective.  Now, can I swap off Queens?",
        "53. Qa7+ Kh6 54. Kf3 Qf6+ 55. Kg3 Kh5": "? Played with the intention of allowing my pawns to start their advance but losing sight of the fact that White can just nick the h-pawn.",

        "56... Kg5 57. Qh4+ Kf5 58. Qf4+ Ke6 59. Qe4+": "? Here, the computer prefers Qc4+, followed by a series of checks and king advances that force Black backwards: Best: +1.03 \u00bb 59.

Kg4": "and now it's -0.01 :-)  Black can't get his K ahead of his p and thereby force White's K away but I could at least have advanced up the board with 66...g5 followed by ...Kh5 etc as shown in the computer's annotation to 64. Qf4?  Was I right to accept the draw offer, or could I have forced or wangled a win?"
