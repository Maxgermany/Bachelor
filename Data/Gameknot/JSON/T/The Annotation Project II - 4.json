        "1. f4": "Another game in the annotation project part II.\r\n\r\nRecently I have fallen away in this tourney after a good start.\r\n\r\nI've seen some of Bobs annotations over the years but never played him.\r\n\r\nI'm not really going to look in depth here more an over view from Whites perspective.",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4": "We pick up the action here.",
        "8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e5": "I've seen this move a few times, I like the following little combination although I'm not sure if its totally the strongest series of moves.",
        "10. Nf7 Qd4": "This is the position for the Queen that Ionadowan spoke about at the start of the tourney",
        "11. Nxe5+": "Wins me the pawn keeps my knight central..",
        "11... Kb6 12. c3": "Trying to force Queen back, if blacks DSB goes to g7 then this will mean whites DSB isn't pinned by potential loss of rook and b2 pawn.",
        "12... Qa4": "If blacks Queen can squeeze onto c2 it could make things quite awkward",
        "13. b3 Qe8": "I'm quite happy here, blacks Queen is back on the back row and my pawn chain has developed.",
        "14. c4": "Now I can free my DSB which so often tends to be a problem in this game for white.",
        "14... Bg7 15. Bb2 Rg8": "Protecting against revealed attack with a check that would win bishop...",
        "16. O-O": "Might as well castle as I can, means I can think about connecting rooks and support my F file pawn.",
        "16... Nc6": "offers exchange... not something I really want to do as would release tension. I can't stay there as would lose pawn in the combination and centralize his Queen.",
        "17. Nd7+": "Still attack the bishop with a revealed attack. I want to rid blacks DSB's reduce the outposts for his knight and hopefully overwork his superior piece with my minor pieces..",
        "17... Ka6 18. Bxg7 Rxg7 19. Nf6 Qd8 20. Nd5": "Decided to head here over Nxe4 as I can win pawn later and here my knights can support each other after N(b)c3, also b knight won't be pinned supporting pawn and and pawn will defend developed knight. \r\n\r\nMost importantly it restricts black and maintains tension.  ",
        "20... b6": "King creating a hole to hide in.",
        "21. Nbc3": "Feeling quite good here attack is starting to work together.",
        "21... Kb7 22. Rae1": "Looking to win pawn and double rooks on e file.",
        "22... h5 23. Bh3 a6": "Takes away b5 outpost for knight.",
        "24. Rxe4 Qd6 25. g3 Rd8 26. Bg2": "Head here as puts bishop on same diagonal as King and may allow chances to pin/discover attacks. Plus theres nothing doing on the h3-c8 line",
        "26... Ka7 27. Rfe1": "I think white is in a good place here, just a matter of having the know how to push forward.",
        "27... Qc5+ 28. Kh1": "Game enters a series of positional jockeying, I think neither of us wanted to commit and leave ourselves open.\r\n\r\n",
        "28... Nd4 29. Re4e5": "Hoping for a discovered atack on Queen with an attack on pawn/knight/rook but nothing is falling into place for a cheap attack..",
        "29... Nf5": "Where is blacks knight heading? I'm trying to take away his outposts, my rooks are there to be forked but he can't there (I think but if I can stop him getting forward it will mean the knight can't spearhead an attack!)",
        "30. Nf6": "unfortunatly my subtle creative attack doesn't yield a free piece!!",
        "30... Qd4 31. Re1e2 Rf7": "Back you go Mr Horse",
        "32. Nfd5": "Don't think there was any real conviction over the last few moves (esp on my behalf). I was almost thinking about offering a draw at this point.\r\n\r\n",
        "32... Rdd7 33. Re5e4 Qg7": "I spy a chance",
        "34. Re4e8": "If I can get my Knight out of the way, Rook to a8 wins the game for white...\r\n\r\nOf course black has to oversee it and not defend against it (so chances are slim)",
        "34... c6": "Blocks the diaganal bishop wants to work on, plus it forces knight away.",
        "35. Nb4": "Really hoping black pushes forward c6-c5 here. But he is far too wise for that!",
        "35... Nd4": "I'm looking to open that diagonal",
        "36. Nxc6+": "Wins sac and pawn at worst, best wins White the game.",
        "36... Nxc6 37. Bxc6 Rdb7": "Best move to stop White winning with Ra8 ",
        "38. Bxb7 Rxb7": "So we've cleared a lot of wood off the board, Whites advantage is with the extra pawns.",
        "39. Nd5": "Bring Knight into the action knowing that it leaves my King and the base of my pawn chain weak. I was very unsure about what would happen here, had a nasty feeling that the Queen would go on a rampage and eat all my pawns and the game would slip away, but I had to attack...",
        "39... Qa1+": "As expected..",
        "40. Kg2 Qxa2": "I wanted to exchange and get rid of Blacks rook although I thought that my knight and rook wouldn't be able to compete with Blacks Queen and would end up been outgunned.",
        "41. Ne7": "I'm thinking my best bet here is to rid the g pawn then cocentrate on promoting a pawn and restricting black that way.",
        "41... Rc7": "This offers me a different opening. \r\n\r\nI wonder what would have happened if I'd have stuck to my orginal plan and taken g6?",
        "42. Nc6+": "If black takes it hands White the game.",
        "42... Kb7": "Blacks only move, from here I should win blacks Rook for my Knight. that would leave White with 2 Rooks and 6 Pawns V's Blacks Queen and 4 Pawns... White should win from there esp as one Pawn is half passed.",
        "43. Nd8+ Ka7": "Only move that saves rook",
        "44. Nc6+ Kb7 45. Nd8+ Ka7 46. Nc6+": "That's it I didn't think that anything else would give me a chance, esp as I've lost the last few in the tourney didn't want to take the chance and I have respect for Bob's play and was happy to draw (even though he does have poor taste in football teams!!) \r\n\r\nThanks for the game Bob."
