        "1. c4 f5": "Blacks reply is typical of the Dutch opening....",
        "2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 d6 4. Nc3 e5": "...i like this opening as Black...I use it myself up to a point, but deviate with a differing plan from Black in this game. This opening for Black gives a very simple but aggressive plan of a kingside attack. Typically supported with Qh5, Ng4 and exchanging the white bishop on g2..this can be dangerous for build up positional openings like the English....!",
        "5. d3 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O": "...if black chose c6,Na7-c7, Qe8-h5 and then g5...this would be a quick attack..another route is taken..but still a kingside attack",
        "7... Nc6 8. e3": "..protecting against f4 advance...",
        "8... a6 9. Rb1": "..typical move in the English....gives flexibility of queenside advance ..",
        "9... Qe8": "...spotted this coming a while back..",
        "10. Nd5": "...decision is to remove the key knight on f6....and gain a tempo with cxd5",
        "10... Nxd5 11. cxd5 Nd8 12. b3": "..decided the strategy will be hold solid in the centre...wait for the kingside storm and drive throught the c file..",
        "12... Nf7 13. Qc2 Bd8": "...normally the black bishop is looking to get to c7 for the long diagonal...but he cant play c6 for the moment...",
        "14. Bb2 g5": "...a bit early...? King will be exposed if the pawns breakdown...",
        "15. Nd2": "..preparing f4..",
        "15... h5": "...bit too much air around the black king now...",
        "16. f4 g4": "black is going all in ..I am expecting Nh6 with Qh5 to follow...Kg7 & Rh8 gives an attack...",
        "17. Qc3": "..time to build pressure on e5 & kingside...",
        "17... Kh7 18. Nc4 Bf6 19. fxe5": "...time to jab at that wall...and see if it crumbles...",
        "19... dxe5 20. e4": "...so now..pressure on e5 and f5.....",
        "20... h4": "..as long as i keep the h file closed this is fine...",
        "21. exf5": "...e4 loses the bishop, just now picked up a pawn..",
        "21... h3 22. Be4": "..more pressure on the king..so i thought i need to re-route and bump that dark square bishop/....",
        "22... Nd6": "..taking the knight only helps black...Nxe4 solidifies for white with dxe4...so i chose to add another piece to the mix...",
        "23. Rbe1 Nf7": "...i want to get at the very airy g file...so need to pull the bishop out of the way to introduce the threat Rf4",
        "24. Bh1 b5": "..helps me re-route the knight to threaten g4",
        "25. Ne3 Rg8": "..this is where black is now in trouble...d6 and the game is over quite quickly...too many threats coming really quick..! Ra8 is attacked, Nd5 is coming threatening a forkand i have 2 rooks slamming down the e & d files....its gets nasty ... ",
        "26. d6 Bd7": "...i am thinking that the idea is Bxa8 is a distant threat of Qxa8 looking at Qg2# but this is easily met....",
        "27. Nd5": "...such a nasty threat...bishop is under threat, Rook on a8 is in danger..all bad for black...",
        "27... Qd8": "...well this is the end really..so how to bring the end....",
        "28. dxc7": "...Rc8 will be answered by a nice combo...cxd8=Q. Black cannot take on c3 owing to a forced mate (..Nxf6  leads to Qxg8 and mate on g6)\r\n\r\nQuick end...will take it as a win for the team...."
