        "1. g4": "The Grob Opening. Coincidentally I had just about finished \"King's Gambit: The Story of a Father, a Son and the World's Most Dangerous Game\" By Paul Hoffman. Hoffman spent an entire chapter on the practitioners of the Grob and had some unsavory opinions of them. Swindlers would be a common theme. So I was hot to beat this guy.",
        "1... d5 2. Bg2 Bxg4 3. c4 Be6": "Reinforcing the pawn. A weak move in retrospect. c6 appears better now. I as a practitioner of the Nimzo Larsen am aware that his goal is to fianchetto the rook on a8 (at least for now later I forget this) so delaying the attack on d5 is what I need to do.",
        "4. Nc3": "Adds to the attack on d5",
        "4... c6 5. Qb3 b6 6. cxd5 Bf5 7. dxc6 Be6 8. Qb5": "Sets up for a discovered check. I'm in a bit of a bind here.",
        "8... Nd7": "If he takes the Knight at least I can put pressure on the Queen with Bxd7.",
        "9. c7 Qxc7 10. Bxa8 Bc4 11. Qc6": "I'm not hot to trade Queens here but I don't see a lot of other options.",

        "19. Bb5 Bb7": "First part of it is in place.",
        "20. d3": "Will he miss it?",
        "20... Rd4": "A Bishop for a little bait ",
        "21. Bxh6": "He takes the bait.",
        "21... Rg4#": "Out hustled the hustler."
