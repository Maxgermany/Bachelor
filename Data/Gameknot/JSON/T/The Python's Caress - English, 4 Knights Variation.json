        "9... O-O-O": "?! ... My personal experience with Q-side castling by Black in the English, is that White almost always wins simply by pushing a direct attack right down the throat of Black's Q-side, be it by pawnstorm or heavy pieces down a half-open file.",
        "10. Ng3 Bg6 11. a3 Bxc3+ 12. bxc3": "Now White has his half-open file.",
        "12... h5 13. Nf1": "Mission accomplished.",
        "13... Qd7 14. a4": "And here comes a pawnstorm ... of one! White has little to worry about on the K-side, until Black gets his pieces out from in front of his pawns.",
        "14... Ne7 15. a5 a6 16. Nd2 Qf5 17. Nb3 Ng4 18. O-O Qg5": "So blunt! And so slow!",

        "25... Rg5 26. Kh2 Bf7": "Well, his Bishop's finally out of the way but now his own Rook spoils the activation of Black's K-side pawns.",
        "27. Rab1 Rh6 28. Rb2 Rhg6 29. g3 Rh5 30. Rfb1 Kd8 31. Ne2": "Taking just a moment to attend to the defense of g3 and h3, for whichever need arises.",
        "31... Rgh6 32. Nf4 Rg5 33. Rb2xb7": "Since White has defended everything, it's time to get the attack under way.",
        "33... Kd7 34. Ra7 Nc8 35. Rxa6 Bh5 36. Rb7 Bf7 37. Rc6": "Black has no counterplay, and White's threats are unendurable. Black resigns."
