        "1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nxd5 4. Nxd5 Qxd5 5. b3": "I haven't often played against this variant, but it seems to pay off well. The threats black normally has are neutralized through the exchange, so that white has time to set up a powerful fianchetto.",
        "5... e5 6. Bb2 Bc5 7. Nf3 Bg4": "I am trying to retain control over d4, so it can't be played by white to grab space.",
        "8. Be2 Nc6 9. O-O O-O-O 10. h3 Bh5": "This is a mistake as white will expertly demonstrate. 10....Bxf3 11. Bxf3 Qe6 leaves white with a rather powerful bishop pair, but white has a slight advantage in the centre and plenty of space for counterplay and could potentially look to set up a pawn storm on the king side, after positioning his rooks on the e- and d-file.",
        "11. Nxe5 Bxe2": "Looking back, I was a bit too afraid of giving up the bishop pair to white in such an open position, since Nxe5 looks a little better to me now.",
        "12. Qxe2 Qxd2": "Too eager to win back the pawn. Playing 12....c6 allows white to defend with Nf3, but then at least the centre is mine after 12....Re8, giving at least some compensation for the pawn, albeit likely insufficient.",
        "13. Qg4+ Kb8 14. Nxf7 Rhf8 15. Nxd8 Bxf2+": "Trying to poke back, but the game is pretty much lost now.",
        "16. Kh1 Rxd8 17. Rad1 Qxc2": "And now white seals the deal with a swift combination.",
        "18. Rxd8+ Nxd8 19. Qd7 Bh4 20. Rc1": "And black resigns. Like I said, it was a rather sloppy match on my part, but hopefully there was still some educational value in the annotation, perhaps mostly from the excellent way in which white managed to punish me."
