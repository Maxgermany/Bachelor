        "16. Bxe7": "The bishop/knight exchange relieves the knight's defense of d5, where white can push the black queen around a little, and maybe bring some power down on the king's pawn fortress.\n",
        "16... Bxe7 17. Nd5 Qa5+ 18. b4 cxb4 19. axb4": "Now the black pawn at a7 is defenseless.",
        "19... Qd8 20. Rxa7 Nc6 21. Ra8+": "The rook will keep black's knight pinned until black moves his king.  White is only up one pawn at this moment, but it will be easier to trade rooks from here.  Every even exchange makes white's one pawn more valuable.  Finally, black's queen is really boxed in as well.  Qd7 is blocked by Nb6+.  Black will have to spend several moves getting material off the back row--moves white will exploit taking pawns or setting up other costly trades.",
        "21... Nb8 22. gxf5 Kd7": "NxB will be followed by BxPb7, or Qg4.  Qg4 sets up discovered check with Pf6 against whichever piece snapped up the knight.",
        "23. Nxe7": "White is only ahead two points after the exchange.  QxN opens up Qg5.  White's undefended bishop could move to e4 to protect the undefended pawn.  Most scenarios look pretty good for white at this point."
