        "1. f4": "Bird's opening. I use it myself sometimes.",
        "1... d5 2. d4": "Not the best move. the main lines here are 2.g3 and 2.e3 (2.b3 is similar to 1.b3 openenig).",
        "2... b6": "What's the point?\r\nThe bishop can move freely on the c8-h3 diagonal, why weakening the queen-side?",
        "3. e3 Nf6 4. Nc3": "4.c3 would give white the stonewall position (like black plays in the dutch opening).",
        "4... c6 5. Nf3 Bg4": "now we can see that b6 was not in place. instead black could already play Nbd7 or e6.",
        "6. Be2 Ne4": "one coukd not attack with only two pieces.",
        "7. Nd2": "7. 0-0 is better. there is no real threat from the black side.",
        "7... Bxe2": "It is better to take first on c3 - making doubled pawns for white.",
        "8. Nxe2 e6 9. O-O c5": "Black is not yet castked and its kind of dangerous to open the center now.",
        "10. Nxe4": "10. c3 is a good option too.",
        "10... dxe4 11. Ng3 f5": "black has a big problem. on the queen-side he is exposed in the white squares with no white squares bishop. in the center all his pawns are on the white squares with no real defense.",
        "12. b3": "yes, the bishop's place is indeed b2.",
        "12... g5": "????\r\nthe king is exposed with no defense and black is helping white to take the a1-h8 diagonal easy.",
        "13. Bb2": "13. Qh5+!",
        "13... Bg7 14. Qh5+ Kf8 15. fxg5": "black is lost. there is no escape for the king.",
        "15... Nc6 16. Rad1 Rg8": "16... Qe7 is needed.",
        "17. Qxh7": "17. dxc5! Qe7 18. Bf6 Bxf6 19. gxf6 Qxf6 20. Nxe4! Qg7 21. g3 bxc5 22. Nxc5 Qf7 23. Qh6+ Ke8 24.Qxe6+ Qxe6 25. Nxe6 +-",
        "17... Qxg5 18. Nxe4 Qg4 19. h3": "why giving up the Knight?",
        "19... Qxe4 20. dxc5": "and why giving up the bishop too?",
        "20... Qxe3+ 21. Kh1 Bxb2 22. Rd7": "it seems that white has a great attack. I'm not sure of it.",
