        "11. h4 b4 12. Na4 d5": "The move 12...d5? opens up the black position where white is better developed with a safe king. Black's position is not yet developed and the king is still in the center.",
        "13. Bh3": "This move sacrifices the e pawn in order to open up the game. I considered g5 but wanted to be able to recapture on g5 with the h pawn.",
