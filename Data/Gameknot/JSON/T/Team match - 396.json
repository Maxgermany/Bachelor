        "9. Nc4 h5": "H5?  is a mistake. This weakens the kings side dramatically making 0-0 almost impossible to play since bxf6 should be met by gxf6",
        "10. Bxf6 gxf6 11. Nd5 Bxd5 12. exd5 Ne7 13. a4": "A4! is a strong move as this shows immediately the weakened position of black. Because of h5, 0-0 is impossible and so to bring the king in safety 0-0-0 should be played but that has a weak point which is the field b6! with a4 white immediately attacks to obtain b6. Black has a problem as 0-0-0 is risky.",
        "13... Qc7 14. a5 O-O-O 15. Ra4": "nice move but also Nb6 first was possible",
        "15... Kb8 16. Nb6 Qc5 17. c3 Nc8": "So this is not so good. On the other hand black has problems to develop the pieces. In nay way white already obtained a big advantage. This move just makes it worse and thats because of the next move",
        "18. Bxa6": "Bxa6!! a striking and winning piece sacrifice. Black is lost!!!",
        "18... Nxb6": "Also bxa6 does not help because of RC4 Qxa5 Nxc8 (RXC8 Qb3)",
        "19. axb6 bxa6 20. Rxa6 Rc8": "only move because of otherwise Ra8+!",
        "21. O-O Qb5 22. Qa1 Kb7 23. Ra7+ Kxb6 24. Qa3 Rc5 25. c4 Rxc4 26. Ra8 Rc7 27. Ra1 Qxd5 28. Rb8+ Rb7 29. Qa7+": "(Kc7 Rxb7+ Qxb7 Rc1+ and mate soon"
