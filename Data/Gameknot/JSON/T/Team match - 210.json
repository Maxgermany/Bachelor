        "9. h3 Ne4 10. Qg4": "Pg7 is considered a \"poisoned\" pawn.  With this particular move, white's black bishop (Bf4) is exposed to attack by e5.  Black would probably deal with the g7 threat first, of course, giving white time to mitigate the risk.",
        "10... Bf6 11. Nxe4": "Now if black threatens the white queen with e5, white moves her and trades a knight.",
        "11... dxe4": "Black chooses to take the knight first.  White's black bishop remains at risk.",
        "12. Qg3": "Risk averted.  But the queen is buried here.  Qe2 might have been a better choice.  White threatens c7.",
