        "1. c4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6": "i don't usually see the symmetrical with the english",
        "3. g3 d6 4. Bg2 Bd7": "and it never lasts",
        "5. Nf3 a6 6. O-O": "i like the way it started: i am well protected, and i can concentrate on attack. ",
        "6... Qc7": "I am not sure this is very comfortable because the queen is expose to a Knight attack. But, till now, it is not very important, though i started to think about potential traps on d5",
        "7. d3 e6 8. e4 h6 9. d4": "my goal was to push on this potential trap.",
        "9... g5": "that is interesting, because black does not hesitate to attack, though the king is clearly not protected and two pieces are still waiting to get out.\n",
        "10. d5": "well, then...",
        "10... Ne5 11. Nxe5 dxe5": "the black position seems inadequate, though it is hard to find a real and concrete weakness. i have considered on sacrificing on g5 sometime, but 1) i was lacking of material; 2) it could have opened my own king side; 3) I had a better plan on queen side",
        "12. Be3 Bd6 13. a3 O-O-O": "this is very dangerous, now, because all my pieces converges there. now my plan on queen side has much more sense",
        "14. Qe2 f5": "who will be first? My d5 is still in my mind: in two moves from now",
        "15. dxe6": "too late for the black attack",
        "15... Bxe6 16. exf5 Bxf5": "so now my d5-knight is open. Bf7 was not better, though, for the loss of a pawn, at least it kept some activity",
        "17. Nd5 Qg7": "and everything seems open for my bishops and my precious knight. Was there a better place for the queen?",
        "18. b4": "let's open all of this...",
        "18... cxb4 19. axb4": "2 valorous pawns, a knight, two bishops and my queen are on the verge to attack an exposed king...",
        "19... Ne7": "necessary. But in the mean time blocking the queen from king side",
        "20. Nb6+": "i want to keep him, so i launch him on the brink.",
        "20... Kb8": "Kc7 was a mess because of c5, losing a bishop.",
        "21. c5": "this is just too good to be true: the black queen is out and the bishops diagonals are opening everywhere",
        "21... Bc7 22. Rxa6": "who needs a rook?",
        "22... Bxb6": "if bxa, then it is checkmate in very few moves. so, this was the only possible move. My knight has been brave and fell for the good of every one",
        "23. Rxb6": "i wonder, maybe i had to sacrifice the rook and take with the pawn... Not sure.",
        "23... e4": "blocking my diagonal, good move, i think, but will not stop me from my attack",
        "24. Qa6": "but, hey! who is there?",
        "24... Nc8": "threatening the draw by three-fold repetition. Actually, i previewed this move, but didn't know exactly if my attack was still possible. Though i refused to stop it",
        "25. Rb5 Na7 26. Rb6 Nc8": "hm, i had to chose where to lose the rook",
        "27. Ra1 Nxb6": "and i can't take it back with the queen, or i lose the other rook",
        "28. Qa7+": "check before taking the knight",
        "28... Kc8": "of course not Kc7, because it would give me a tempo when i take the knight... But mostly, it gives me... the queen: if Kc7, then Qxb6+ and whatever the king does the queen will fall after two or three moves.",
        "29. cxb6": "prohibiting Kd7, giving me another tempo... and the queen",
        "29... Qe5": "interesting, but though...",
        "30. Rc1+": "yep, that move is the best one and at least regain the loss. But at least it saved the queen.",
        "30... Kd7": "one and only",
        "31. Qxb7+": "equal in term of material",
        "31... Ke8": "was Ke6 better?",
        "32. Qc6+": "allowing passage to my pawns... and now i have to make them protect each other.",
        "32... Kf7 33. Qc7+": "this is it!",
        "33... Qxc7": "i wonder if Qe7 was maybe better",
        "34. bxc7": "because i don't see how to stop them now",
        "34... Rd7": "it is almost over now",
        "35. b5 Rd5 36. b6 Rb5": "this is too kind: my light bishop can now take place in game",
        "37. Bf1 Rb4 38. Ba6": "announcing b7",
        "38... Ra8 39. b7": "only move: Rxb7... So black resigned"
