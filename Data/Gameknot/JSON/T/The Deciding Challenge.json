    "moves": {
        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6": "A couple of games back, I played a Modern Benoni (beginning 2...c5) and won.  Time for something different: a King's Indian Defence.",
        "3. Nf3": "Unusual move order, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Was White trying to invite a Benoni?",
        "3... Bg7": "Certainly 3...c5 was playable, but I had already determined what opening I was going to play.",
        "4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6": "Also playable were ...c6 or ...c5 here.  But I prefer the main lines anyway, which look to action on the K-side.",
        "6. Be2 e5": "So far, a main line King's Indian.  But now White diverges...",
        "7. dxe5": "I have to admit, I don't much like the sort of game that emerges from this kind of exchange, though my record on the Black side hasn't been too bad.  It proves very difficult for both sides to establish any kind of edge.  Against the more usual 7.0-0 I would probably have played 7...Nc6.",
        "7... dxe5 8. Qxd8": "Yep: there go the Queens.  White could have tried the quite playable 8.Qc2, but then one would be inclined to wonder why the exchange on e5.",
        "8... Rxd8 9. Bg5": "Better than 9.Nxe5 Nxe4!",
        "9... Nbd7": "To protect the e-pawn.  Black has little to fear from 10.Nd5 (...c6!).",
        "10. Rd1": "An interesting alternative was 10.0-0-0.  ",
        "10... Rf8": "Unpinning the d7-knight.  Black dared not place the rook on e8 owing to 10...Re8? 11.Nb5! Rb8 12.Nxc7 Rf8 13.Nd5, with advantage.",
        "11. Nd2": "(!?) Castling instead seems good here.  Is the knight headed for b3?",
        "11... c6": "To prevent a knight's getting in to b5 or d5.",
        "12. Be3": "Aiming to relocate to or protect c5?  At any rate, there's not much doing on the K-side, so White redeploys.",
        "12... Rd8": "The pin released, Black rook returns to d8.  But 12...b6 at once might have been preferable. This rook, however, move is by way of preparing for the bishop to depart from the c8-square.",
        "13. O-O b6 14. Nf3": "Very mysterious and surprising.  I thought the knight would appear at b3 at some time... Here, the threat 15.Nxe5 is easily met.",
        "14... Bb7 15. Rd3": "This must have been White's main idea: to double rooks on the d-file.  As the pin at d7 would have been very uncomfortable, Black reacts at once...",
        "15... Kf8": "(!) Preparing to challenge the double rooks in the d-file...",
        "16. Rfd1 Ke8": "Now there is no pin.  All the same, Black is in no hurry to liquidate the rooks.  Note that both sides have played very cautiously, neither giving much away, neither over-committing to any positive action.  White has a very centralised position, which answers for the hole at d4.  Black is less compact, but has no real weaknesses to speak of.  This is a tough fight for both sides...",
        "17. Nd2": "More patient manoeuvring.  Is the knight headed for b3 after all?  ",
        "17... Bf8": "(!) Taking advantage of the absence of pressure on the K-side, Black redeploys the bishop to a more active, central location.  ",
        "18. Nf3": "Back again??  Placing pressure on the e-pawn, maybe?",
        "18... h6": "Keeping the enemy out of g5 (the threat, for what it was worth, being 19.Bg5).",
        "19. g3 g5 20. a3": "(!?) I was expecting more action on the K-side, viz: 20.h4 g4 21.Nh2 h5 22.Bg5 Be7 23.f3, say.  At that point I might well have played 23...Nc5.",
        "20... Be7 21. Kg2 Ba6": "So cagey have both sides been, that it is very hard to find point to attack.  The c4-square is a particularly dangerous spot...",
        "22. b4": "(!) Hoping to induce Black to take the c-pawn?  The result might have been 22...Bxc4?! 23.Rxd7! Rxd7 24.Bxc4! Rxd1 25.Nxd1 b5 26.Bb3... Now, quite a few of my recent games have featured R+P vs 2 minor pieces, but I didn't fancy the chances of the R+P in this particular game.",
        "22... Bb7 23. h4 g4 24. Nd2": "From h2, this knight might not again have seen the light of day,,,",
        "24... h5": "Having staked out a sizeable tract of K-side territory, I did wonder if White might challenge Black's position there by 24.f3....",
        "25. Rb1": "Nope: White has other ideas.",
        "25... Nf8": "Taking the opportunity to improve the position of this knight.  I didn't mind exchanging one pair of rooks...",
        "26. c5": "Hoping to open the b-file?  Black was not averse to this - and I certainly wasn't willing (if I could avoid it) to write down my light-square bishop (LSB) by ...b5.  But I want the file opened on my terms.  The battle now shifts to the Q-side.",
        "26... Ne6 27. Nb3": "(!?)  Also playable was 27.Rxd8 Rxd8 28.Nc4 Nd4 29.Nxe5 Nxe2 30.Nxe2 Nxe4 31.Nf4 with an OK game for White.",
        "27... Rxd3 28. Bxd3 Rd8": "At this point I thought the game was very close to dead even.",
        "29. Rd1 bxc5": "Now Black opens the b-file.  ",
        "30. Nxc5 Nxc5 31. bxc5 Bc8": "Aiming for e6.  Note that Black's pieces will soon be as centralised as White's.  Black is not too concerned with seizing the b-file just yet.  With one rook apiece, neither side can occupy both open files!",
        "32. Bc2 Nd7": "(!?) Probably Black ought to have looked more closely at exchanging rooks before making this move.  The rookless endgame might have been marginally in Black's favour owing to his more centrally located King, and slightly better pawns after 32...Rxd1 33.Bxd1 Nd7 34.Na4 Ba6.  ",
        "33. Bb3": "(!) Not a bad indirect protection of the c-pawn!",
        "33... f6": "Weakens the light squares, it's true, but I felt that if the enemy bishop did manage to get through to f7 it could have the square, but not the pawn.  If instead 33...Bxc5, then  34.Bxc5 Nxc5 35.Rxd8+ Kxd8 36.Bxf7 and the pawn at h5 falls.  White could probably have fancied his chances in such a continuation. ",
        "34. Na4 Ba6 35. Rd2": "Presumably wanting his LSB on e6, White ensures his rook is adequately protected.",
        "35... Rb8": "Now things liven up a bit.  Black hopes with this attack on the Q-side to pick up a pawn...",
        "36. Be6": "Counter in the centre - not a bad idea!",
        "36... Nf8 37. Ba2": "(!) Having discouraged the knight's attentions towards the c-pawn, the bishop retires into a safe reserve position.  There was nothing for the bishop on f5...",
        "37... Rb5": "A considerable battle is developing around the c5-pawn...",
        "38. Bc4 Ra5 39. Bb3": "Stout defence by this heroic bishop!",
        "39... Bb5": "(?)  Probably too direct an approach, compromising what slender winning chances Black might have.  As it transpires, Black might have gained more by redeploying the bishop via c8 to e6.",
        "40. Nc3 Rxa3": "The fruits of a successful attack?  No The win of the pawn is illusory and transitory...",
        "41. Nxb5 Rxb3": "(?!) I had originally intended 41...cxb5, but after 42.Bd5 b4 43.Bc6+ White seemed to get good counterplay.  Unfortunately the line I played turned out to be no better.",
        "42. Nd6+": "(!) Instead 42.Nxa7 (which was what I expected) ...Ne6 43.Nxc6 Bxc5 44.Bxc5 Nxc5 with good play for Black (45.Rd5 Rc3).  Whether it could have been developed into a win is problematical, though.  All the same, White's actual choice is much better.",
        "42... Bxd6": "(!?) Another try was 42...Kd8!? but after 43.Nf5+ Nd7 44.Ng7! White's K-side counterplay looks more promising than Black's Q-side action.  But now,, after 42...Bxd6, Black will have to defend a R+P ending a pawn down.",
        "43. Rxd6 Kf7 44. Rxc6 Ne6": "Stopping the c-pawn must take a higher priority than protecting the a-pawn.  Black is fighting for a draw, now.",
        "45. Ra6 Rc3": "Rook goes behind the passer, naturally enough...",
        "46. Rxa7+ Kg6 47. Ra5 Rc4": "For the moment, Black has committed both White's active pieces to defending the c-pawn, and also made it hard for the thing to advance.  Now Black also threatens also to snip off the e-pawn.",
        "48. Ra6": "(!) The best chance.  Black dare not take either pawn (48...Nxc5? 49.Rc6 or 48...Rxe4? 49.Rxe6)",
        "48... Kf7 49. Ra7+ Kg6": "A tacit draw offer.  I wanted in any case to keep the knight within quick reach of the c-pawn",
        "50. Re7 Nd8": "(!?) Not liking the look of 50...Nd4. But see Black's 52nd!",
        "51. Re8": "White has twigged to the fact that Black is adhering as close as possible to the status quo.  So he stops the knight getting back to e6.",
        "51... Nc6": "Let the King hold the K-side.  R and N will hold back the c-pawn.",
        "52. Re6 Nd4": "(!?) Why play ...Nd4 now, and not two moves ago?  The difference is that the White rook is on e6, and not e7, allowing the Black King to reach f7.  I must admit I didn't particularly notice this \"change of mind\" at the time...",
        "53. Ra6": "Preserving some winning chances, however slender.  Instead 53.Bxd4 Rxd4 [a] 54.Kf1 Rxe4 55.c6 Rc4 (=) or [b] 54.Re8 Rxe4 55.c6 Rc4 56.Rg8+ Kh7 57.Rc8 Rc1 (=).",
        "53... Rxc5 54. Ra4 Kf7": "The knight is pinned, so White will get his extra pawn back.  Time to bring up the King.  Note that White's King is well out of the action - a big help to Black.",
        "55. Bxd4 exd4 56. Rxd4 Ke6": "At this point I was pretty confident of the draw.  All the pawns are now on one side of the board (although Black's aren't very strong), and White's King hard to activate.  I had a couple of times earlier than this considered offering a draw, but felt that since he had the stronger side it was up to my opponent.  At some point I did express my view that it was \"drawish\", but without explicitly suggesting that he ought to offer one himself.",
        "57. Rd8 Ke5 58. Re8+ Kd4": "The Black King is much the more lively monarch.  My only concern was that it might in some lines be cut off from the K-side - not necessarily fatal, withal, but it might have made the defence difficult.",
        "59. Re6 f5": "(!) ",
        "60. exf5 Rxf5": "Must be a book draw here - all the pawns on one side, White's extra pawn is backward, Black's King more actively placed.  But...",
        "61. Ra6 Rb5": "Black intends as much as possible to keep the rook on the same rank as his pawn.",
        "62. Ra3 Ke4": "(!?) I think this was actually a fingerslip, having intended 62...Ke5.  The idea was 62...Ke5 63.f4+ gxf3ep+ 64.Kxf3 Kf5 with a kind of \"fortress\".  It is doubtful that White could have made progress from there!",
        "63. Ra8 Kf5 64. Rc8 Ra5 65. Rf8+ Ke4 66. f3+": "This had to come sooner or later...",
        "66... gxf3+ 67. Rxf3 Ra2+": "Well... worth a try...",
        "68. Rf2 Ra5": "Back to the 4th rank guard post.",
        "69. g4": "(!) Not a bad try at all! There's nothing else.",
        "69... hxg4 70. h5": "White offered a draw after playing this move.  But White could further have tested Black's defences by 70.Kg3!  I would probably have responded with 70...Ra8, with the following plausible continuation in mind: 71.h5 Rg8 72.Rf7 Ke5 73.h6 Rh8 74.h7 Ke6 75.Ra7 Kf5 76.Rg7 Kf6 77.Ra7 Kg6 78.Ra6+ Kxh7 Draw!\r\nA tough encounter!"
