    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "Another game from the ongoing Annotation Project, with a forced opening involving an interesting queen sacrifice.",
        "1... c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5": "White begins the attack on f7, which will involve losing the queen but will bring Black's king into the open.",
        "4... Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+": "This is the first \"free\" move, but still forced in a sense, as there is no other way of gaining sufficient compensation for the queen.",
        "7... Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6": "This is beginning to prove the most popular choice of king move. 8... Kd6 can be ruled right out (9. Nf7+ and White is winning); 8... Kc7 and after 9. Bxg4 either the king or queen must move to avoid the fork on e6; 8... Ke8 invites 9. Bf7+ and an early draw.",
        "9. Bxg4 e6": "This is also becoming the main line as the tournament progresses and the early experimentation dies down. Black, being so much material ahead, gives a pawn back to let his pieces develop. White can even take the exchange with 10. Nf7, but this seems to favour Black, since White's play depends on his minor pieces.",
        "10. Nc3": "Rapid development is essential if White is to maintain pressure in view of his material deficit.",
        "10... Na6": "This development of the knight to the side is common in this line, since c6 is taken.",
        "11. a3": "I have been told that 11. a3 is \"essential\" to prevent 11... Nb4. I still don't see it -- my games as Black where I've played Nb4 have all gone badly so far -- but I play the move all the same.",
        "11... Qf6": "Attacking White's f4 pawn and making way for the rook. Still following the main line, according to the database.",
        "12. O-O": "White defends the pawn and gets his king to safety.",
        "12... h5": "Another database recommendation. Black disturbs the White bishop, forcing it to choose between the immediate capture on e6 or surrendering the pressure on that square.",
        "13. Be2": "I choose the retreat, after noting that 13. Bxe6 Nc7 gets Black's knight to a better square with tempo. This move also makes it possible to put a piece on b5 should that be advantageous at a later stage.",
        "13... Be7": "Development. 13... Bd6 would block the best file for Black's rooks.",
        "14. Ngxe4": "At this stage we're down to two database games that reached this position (although it's a bit of a shock to realise that as my rating crossed 1600 recently, my game will be the third!) The choice is between 14. Ncxe4 (as in rt4sm vs. enasab, 0-1 in 22 moves) or 14. Ngxe4 (as in cliang vs. rockroy, 1-0 in 36 moves). The fact that White won after 14. Ngxe4 does not necessarily prove this the better move, especially as both of these games were won by the higher-rated player. However, I prefer this capture, as the other allows 14... Qd4+ 15. Kh1 Bxg5, exchanging a pair of pieces.",
        "14... Qd4+ 15. Kh1 Raf8": "Black now departs from cliang vs. rockroy (in which 15... g6 was played), so we are in uncharted territory. This move activates the rook and restores the pressure on my f-pawn, though for now it is adequately defended. I feel it would have been better to play this move with the other rook, since Black could then get both rooks to active positions on d8 and f8; on h8 the rook is not doing much.",
        "16. b3": "Preparing to develop the bishop. With the possibility of gaining tempo on the queen in sight, or even a skewer winning the g7 pawn with a fork of the rooks, I feel this is a better development than via d2.",
        "16... Nc7": "Black gets the knight to a better square and denies my pieces the b5 square.",
        "17. Bb2 Qd8": "Black gets out of the way of the potential skewer.",
        "18. Na4": "I play Na4 anyway, releasing the bishop's power on the diagonal and also increasing the pressure on the c5 pawn.",
        "18... Bf6": "Black blocks the attack, forcing an exchange of pieces, which he hopes will help to cement his material advantage. The downside is that the c5 pawn is lost, which could have been prevented by 18... Rf7 or Rh7. I would then probably have continued by developing my inactive queen's rook, but it would have been difficult to make progress.",
        "19. Bxf6 gxf6 20. Nexc5": "I chose this knight to make the capture as 20. Naxc5 f5 is awkward for White to meet. Now White is threatening 21. Bf3+ Kd6 (Kb5 22. c4+ Ka5 23. b4#) 22. Nxb7+ winning the queen.",
        "20... Qe7": "Black gets the queen out of harm's way.",
        "21. Bf3+": "White can still win the b7 pawn, and hopes to confine the Black king and so gain useful tempi by forcing Black to find defensive moves.",
        "21... Kd6 22. Nxb7+": "Before this move the Black king has no legal moves, but sadly there is no way to create a checkmate threat. On with the main plan...",
        "22... Kd7 23. Nac5+": "Now the other knight joins the action! Having knights defending each other like this can either be a weakness or a strength. It is a weakness if the knights get in each other's way (this is often called \"the superfluous knight\"). But it is a strength, as here, if they are immune to attack by pawns and can remain as a self-supporting unit, a thorn in the enemy's side controlling several useful squares.",
        "23... Ke8 24. Rfe1": "\"Place your rook on the line of the queen\" -- but the move is even stronger if the enemy king is on the same line.",
        "24... Kf7": "For that reason, Black's king immediately leaves the line. The knight defends e6, but if the king had stayed put, White could simply take out the defender with Na6 and wreak havoc.",
        "25. f5": "An obvious move, using the pin to storm the flimsy barrier put up by Black's two remaining central pawns.",
        "25... Kg7": "Was this the losing mistake? White now gets a passed pawn (in fact, TWO passed pawns in addition to the one he already has) and these pawns will end up being too strong for Black's defences. The most obvious alternative is 25... e5, when White can still get a dangerous attack after 26. d4.",
        "26. fxe6 f5": "Freeing f6 for the queen, since White's knights currently prevent her moving anywhere useful.",
        "27. d4": "Passed pawns must be pushed! This move now cannot wait, since it would need more preparation if Black's queen were on f6, and in addition, if Black is given time to play that move, White's pieces may have to leave their good squares to defend the other queenside pawns.",
        "27... Nb5": "Defends d6, and also prepares for Black's next.",
        "28. d5 Rfb8": "Black decides to threaten taking off the pair of knights.",
        "29. c4": "White responds by solidifying the pawn chain, also having in mind a possible future advance to c5 and d6 to drive the queen from her blockading perch.",
        "29... Nd6": "Black is determined to get rid of those knights!",
        "30. b4": "(!?) A speculative sacrifice. White prepares for the c5-d6 advance just mentioned, having in mind that with the knights off, Black may be forced to give a rook to prevent promotion. Also, if Black accepts the sacrifice by 30... Nxb7 31. Nxb7 Qxb7, 32. d6 comes with tempo. Instead, 30. Nxd6 was possible (and should also be winning for White). Or 30. Na5. But the c5 knight was in the way, and I thought that by ditching it I might win faster. (Note, by the way, that Black should not play 30... Nxb7 31. Nxb7 Rxb7 in view of the double attack after 32. d6.)",
        "30... Rxb7": "I had not considered this. Black accepts the sacrifice but offers an exchange sacrifice in return, hoping that keeping the knight gives him better defensive chances. This, while not refuting my sacrifice, does at least refute my confidence in thinking that 30. b4 would win quickly.",
        "31. Nxb7 Qxb7": "I was expecting 31... Nxb7, to which I would have responded with the same move, 32. c5.",
        "32. c5": "And now we have reached nominal material equality -- but in fact the points system masks the fact that material imbalances adding up to the same number of points are rarely equal. Here the imbalance, subtracting the pieces held by both sides, is rook, bishop and four pawns against queen and knight. Let's ignore the bishop and knight, which will soon be exchanged. Rook and four pawns against queen, like many material imbalances with pawns against pieces, can favour either side depending on the pawn structure. Here, the pawns are as strong as they can possibly be, in a solid chain with a strong base, the outliers well advanced and with no enemy pawns in their way. I feel White must now be winning.",
        "32... Ne4": "Black blocks both the rook's control of the e-file and the bishop's defence of d5. The downside is that after the obvious move 33. d6, the knight is pinned and Black cannot prevent its being exchanged.",
        "33. d6 Qb5": "A good position for the queen, keeping an eye on my pawns' potential advance while also looking aggressively towards my king in the corner.",
        "34. Bxe4": "I decide the time has come to exchange the knight before it can get up to any mischief. This also reopens the e-file so that I can threaten to advance the pawns again.",
        "34... fxe4 35. Rxe4 Rf8": "Threatening 36... Qf1+ 37. Rxf1 Rxf1#. Aside from this threat, which is too easily dealt with to be much of a problem, the move activates Black's rook on an open file. The downside is that if White gets the chance, e7 is now with tempo.",
        "36. Ree1 Qc6": "Black now threatens 37... Rf2 and 38... Qxg2#. This is a more potent threat, since I would be forced to play 38. Rg1, relegating the rook to a passive position. Therefore:",
        "37. Ref1": "I seize the open file for myself. If Black moves the rook horizontally, 38. Rf7+ takes control of the last bridge the pawns need to cross -- one of them has now been waiting on e6 for twelve moves!",
        "37... Rxf1+": "Black therefore exchanges, and we now enter a queen vs. rook endgame. But the rook -- like the tower it represents -- will have the role of protection for the king, while the pawns take the real starring role.",
        "38. Rxf1 Qe4": "Threatening the undefended pawn on e6.",
        "39. d7": "(!) Stronger than 39. e7, because Black needs to spend a move to keep d8 defended.",
        "39... Qe2": "Attempting to gain tempo by threatening the rook (and checkmate).",
        "40. Rf7+": "Escape by means of check!",
        "40... Kg6 41. h3": "And finally, a quiet move that seals victory.",
        "41... Qe1+ 42. Kh2 Qe5+ 43. Kg1": "Black cannot now continue checking for ever: 42... Qe3+ 43. Rf2 Qe1+ 44. Rf1 Qe3+ 45. Kh1. However, I would have been interested to see how the game would have continued after 45... Qe2 46. Rg1. Perhaps 46... Qd2 47. c6 Qd6 48. c7! Qxc7 49. Rd1 Qd8 50. e7. Come to think of it, a similar line could follow had I played 40. Rg1.",
        "43... Qxe6": "Instead, Black takes the pawn, asking me whether I am giving up the rook.",
        "44. d8=Q": "I am; I can't see anything better, and surely White must be able to promote the c-pawn now, even without the help of the king.",
        "44... Qxf7": "I think 44... Kxf7 would have offered more resistance, as it creates a genuine threat of perpetual check and forces White to play accurately.",
        "45. Qd6+ Kg5 46. c6": "Now it's all plain sailing. White gains a vital tempo, and even if Black plays 46... Qe8 to threaten perpetual, White has the resources to prevent it. (47. Qd2+ and 48. b5 defends the c-pawn, and 49. Qc3 prepares its advance while keeping the possible checking squares under control.)",
        "46... a6 47. c7 Qf5": "Black missed the opportunity to prolong the game on move 46, and now there is no good way of controlling the c8 square. 47... Qe8 or Qg8 is met with 48. Qd8+, and this:",
        "48. Qc5": "A pin, followed by a forced queen exchange and promotion. Black resigns. It's appropriate, considering the way this wild opening is characterised by a battle between the solidarity of White's pieces and the mobility of Black's queen, that the game should conclude by finally shutting the queen down completely."
