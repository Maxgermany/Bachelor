        "1. e4 c5 2. d4": "The Smith-Morra. One of several playable openings against the Sicilian. Though, from experience, I can tell you that it is probably not the best option. The main line leaves white a pawn down for rapid development and center control, which can effectively take down weaker players and players that do not often play the Smith-Morra. Fortunately, I have played several games with this opening; both using it and against it, so I have a knowledge of how to catch up to the opponent before he or she launches a powerful attack. ",
        "2... cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3": "This is the main line and you can see how my opponent may move all of his or her pieces out  into a good position, excluding the rooks, leading to a rapid development.",
        "4... Nc6 5. Nf3 e6 6. Bc4": "Typical move set, that really isn't offensive enough. I think these moves are a bit too passive, but perhaps it is because I play too much offensively based games.",
        "6... Nf6 7. Qe2": "Passively setting up for a little coup de grace for my minor pieces.",
        "7... Bc5 8. Bg5 Qa5": "It's not a good one at that, though.",
        "9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. O-O Qc7": "I believe this is pretty useless, but all the other moves are just as adequate. ",
        "11. Rac1": "I don't understand this move either. It sets up only a poor attack. Rad1 seemed a better move.",
        "11... Qf4 12. Bb3 O-O": "Castling into vulnerable space usually is a horrible choice, but in this case it sets a good offensive and an attack on the king is unattainable at the moment, but regardless, it may be a weakness in the endgame.",
        "13. g3 Qg4 14. Kg2 Qg7 15. Nb5 d6 16. Rfd1 Rd8 17. a3": "I am puzzled by what this is supposed to accomplish.",
        "17... Rb8 18. Ba2 a5 19. Nd2": "My opponent seems to have a bit of problem with his knights. ",
        "19... b6 20. Nc4 Ba6 21. Ncxd6": "? This is a mistake at the least. My opponent loses at least 2 points in material.",
        "21... Nd4 22. Rxd4": "This loses less than the alternative, which is to lose a knight.",
        "22... Bxd4 23. Qf3": "This is another mistake, losing a pawn. It seems my opponent is starting to slip.",
        "23... Bxb2 24. Rc7": "Trying to force down my defense and attack my king and queen.",
        "24... Bxb5 25. Nxb5": "A Simple Exchange.",
        "25... Qg5 26. a4 Be5 27. Ra7 Rd2": "Slowly setting up an attack against White King, while also threatening several minor pieces in the meantime. It's a good strategy, but you have to make sure your opponent does not strike first. ",
        "28. h4": "This move isn't necessarily good, as it lowers defense with the king, but it does make the rook vulnerable.  ",
        "28... Qg6 29. Bb3 Rbd8 30. Bc4 Rc8 31. Bb3 Rcd8 32. Bc4 Bd4": "Okay, I get this was a mistake, but I was not going into a draw by repetition .",
        "33. Nxd4 Rd8xd4 34. Bb5 Qxe4": "I was able to snag a extra pawn off the exchange, though.",
        "35. Rb7 Qg6 36. Be8": "This move really screwed him up. A dangerous gamble, that though at first glance it looks like a good move, it is actually a move that loses pretty badly.",
        "36... Rd4d3": "Now noticing that the line ahead of him, which is Bxf7+, loses a bishop, my opponent starts stalling the timer.",
        "37. Qf4": "Hoping this can save him, he goes for a desperate attempt of saving his queen.",
        "37... e5": "Still desperate for the game not to go any worse, my opponent is about to make a fatal blunder",
        "38. Qc4": "Thinking that he has outplayed me and I lost my queen, he confidently plays this move. What he doesn't see is his mistake, which leads to...",
        "38... Qxg3+": "0-1. In the process of saving his queen, my opponent subsequently lets the king die for her."
