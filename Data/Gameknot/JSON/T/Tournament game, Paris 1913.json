        "4... Bg4": "Alekhine was never one to be passive.",
        "5. Qb3": "Unpinning.",
        "5... Qe7 6. Ng5": "This attack is easily repulsed, as the Q-side pieces are still undeveloped.",

        "9. Qxb7": "Removing the Q from the defense, his only active piece. White would have been better served with a move such as 9 P-Q3, allowing the development of his Q-side pieces with B-K3 and N-Q2.",
        "9... Kd7 10. Qxa8": "At least he has the consolation of winning some material before being buried by Black's coming onslaught.",
        "10... Qc4": "Threatening mate on the move with ...Q-K7! White's undeveloped Q-side is useless.",

        "14. cxd4 Be7": "White overlooks the threat. 15 K-B2 is the only way to prolong the game.",
        "15. Qxh8": "Blinded by greed.",
        "15... Bh4#": "Proving that material is less important than skill. Well done by the young Alekhine."
