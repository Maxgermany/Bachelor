        "2... f6": "?! The Damiano Defence. This will allow me to mess up my opponent's position a lot. I prefer Nc3.",
        "3. Nxe5": "Here is the knight sacrifice. From this point onwards, Black is in dire straits.",
        "3... fxe5": "He retakes, a bit surprised at my move.",
        "4. Qh5+": "Check. Here is a chance to win a pawn.",
        "4... Ke7": "g6 allows me to get the rook, but this allows me to develop with tempo and wreck Black's position more.",
        "5. Qxe5+": "Black is forced to do Kf7.",
        "5... Kf7 6. Bc4+": "Developing with tempo.",
        "6... Kg6": "Another option was d5, but that gives away a pawn at best.",

        "8... g5": "The best move.",
        "9. Bxg5+": "Check. I don't think that this leads to a forced mate. However Qxg5 allows me to go on a killing spree, starting with Qxf8+. Is there a move here leading to forced mate?",
        "9... Kh5": "Allowing a mate in one, either by g4# or Bf7#.",
        "10. Bf7#": "Checkmate! Although we are equal in material points, we aren't in position. Black's king is stuck on the side of the board and no pieces have been developed. The moral: play the Damiano Defence with caution. Please give constructive and helpful comments."
