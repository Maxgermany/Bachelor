        "12. f4 O-O": "i'm not certain who's winning here.  we have all our pieces developed.  white controls 3 central squares, and i only 2, but my light-squared bishop indirectly contributes to 2.  both queens do the same thing.  thoughts on this would be helpful.",

        "18... f6": "my plan is 19.Nxf6..Rxf6, 20.Qxf6..Rf8, and gain a tad bit of tempo, but down significant material.  hoping to push my c file pawn up, and strike a mate",
