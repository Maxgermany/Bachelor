        "3. f3": "3. Nf3 is better in order to prevent e5 from black.",
        "3... e5 4. c3 exd4 5. cxd4": "white is left with a strong center.",
        "5... Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3": "white has a great space to play in and a strong center. black had not move any piece yet.",
        "7... d6 8. d5": "maybe too soon. I think that Bc4 is much better.",
        "8... c6 9. c4": "white has played with his pawns too far. it is important to remember that pawns cant play backwards and they need pieces to support them from behind.",
        "9... c5 10. Bf4 g5 11. Bg3 a6": "black is playing wierd too. why isnt he developing pieces?",
        "12. Bd3 h5 13. Ne2 h4 14. Bf2 b6": "strange game...\r\nblack is moving too fast with his pawns too instead of playing moves such as Nd7-e5, Ne7-g6 etc.",
        "15. a4 a5 16. O-O Qe7": "at last! black moved a piece!",
        "17. Qb3": "I think that h3 is important in order to prevent the same from black.",
        "17... h3 18. g3 g4 19. f4": "now the e4 square is weak. black has pawns in the king side that pressing the white king.",
        "19... Nd7 20. f5": "what else can be done? black wanted to play f5! himself.",
        "20... Ne5 21. Qxb6 Nf3+": "! fiest - put the white king on h1 where taking later the e4 pawn will be with a check.",
        "22. Kh1 Ne5 23. Be1": "?? white did not notice that black is willing to sacrifice the rook and give white a mate. Bc2 was necessary.",
        "23... Nxd3 24. Qc6+ Kf7 25. Qxa8 Qxe4+": "the end."
