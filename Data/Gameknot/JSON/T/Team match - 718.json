        "12... Qe7": "Thats right, sucka. I contemplated bishop to f5 knowing he wouldn't do it or else lose the queen. queen and bishop isn't always a good trade for a queen, but I was willing here. Instead I found a better move, moving the knight in.",
        "13. Ne5 Nxd4": "Yes, dude, it's a free pawn, but your knight is completely unprotected.",
        "14. Ng6": "Attacks the queen, he probably thinks thats he getting a knight for a pawn, but he forgot about leaving that knight wide open",
        "14... fxg6 15. Bxg6+": "his check forces him to move. I knew he wouldn't cover with the queen, and I knew he couldn't come closer with his king (the only way would be on the diagonal)",
        "15... Kf8": "Wow, dangerous to angle your king behind a queen on a diagonal. I wish I would have had protection on d6 for the pin.",

        "18... Ra7": "Not sure, I think he thought my queen would be trapped in deeper than it really was?",
        "19. Qxc8": "I don't see the trap. In hindsight, I don't believe there was one.",
        "19... Qd7": "He wants to trade queen after his screw up, but.....",

        "21. Rxe6": "Great move opened up, he does see it and resigns. If he went for my queen, rook to e8 would have been mate."
