        "1. e4": "And another annotation at the request of a team mate!",
        "1... d5 2. exd5": "This is the Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01), White correctly takes.",
        "2... Qxd5 3. Nc3": "This is the Lasker variation. I like white's move, attacking the queen.",
        "3... Qa5 4. Bc4": "3. d4 is more common, but nothing wrong with this...",
        "4... Nf6 5. Nf3": "both knights come out",
        "5... c6 6. O-O": "Both sides develop. c6 is often played by Black to give an escape square to the queen after d4 and Bd2 or, less usually a3 and b4",
        "6... Bg4 7. Be2": "White just wastes a move in retreating the Bishop. Re1, h6, d4 or d3 were all better. White is just a tempo down on the main line now.",
        "7... e6 8. d4": "At last!",
        "8... Bb4": "This position has actually occoured in other games, but Black played Be7, Bd6 or Nbd7, all of which are stronger, because of what follows next....",
        "9. Bd2": "Both sides develop",
        "9... O-O 10. a3": "A logical move from white, putting the question to the bishop",
        "10... Bxc3 11. Bxc3": "So white has obtained the two bishops, in an open position.",
        "11... Qc7 12. Ne5": "This isn't really a bad move, but I would have thought it better to preserve the white squared bishops. Maybe moves like b3 followed by Bb2 and c4 is a better plan? What do you think dear reader?",
        "12... Bxe2 13. Qxe2": "So Bishops are exchanged",
        "13... Nbd7 14. Nxd7": "White rather falls in with White's plan here. Maybe White could play 14. Bb4 hitting the rook on f8, and after it moves, play Nc4 and maybe playing a bishop or knight into d6 at some point. Or maybe just playing Nd3 maintaining the tension. White has a slight spacial advantage in the centre, thanks to the pawn on d4 and so should be avoiding exchanges.",
        "14... Qxd7 15. Rad1": "Sound development by white.",
        "15... Nd5 16. Bd2": "White wisely avoids the exchange on c3.",
        "16... Rfe8 17. Qg4": "White seems to be dreaming of a king side attack, but with so few minor pieces left on the board, it is not really on.",
        "17... Nf6 18. Qg3": "Still dreaming of attacks....",
        "18... Ne4 19. Qd3": "The queen is driven away. Black could just exchange on d2 and it will be hard for either side to make much of the position.",
        "19... f5 20. Bf4": "White may have an edge now, the Bishop can go to e5....",
        "20... Rad8 21. c3": "I don't like c3, I prefer Be5",
        "21... Nf6 22. h3": "h3 seems a waste of time",
        "22... c5 23. Be5": "At last!",
        "23... Qd5 24. f4": "Interesting position. White is weak on the white squares and Black is weak on the black squares!",
        "24... Nd7 25. Bc7": "This doesn't do much good, the exchange on e5 is still coming up.",
        "25... Rdc8 26. Be5": "The bishop has to retrun here. If 26. Ba5? b6! and it is lost for a pawn.",
        "26... Nxe5": "So the exchange happens",
        "27. dxe5 Qb3": "I am not sure why Black plays this. After a queen exchange the ending should be drawn.",
        "28. c4": "Black sets a trap",
        "28... Red8": "which black falls into!",
        "29. Qxb3": "Oops! 1-0!\r\nThanks for reading, please leave a comment or two, and rate my annotation with a star or two!"
