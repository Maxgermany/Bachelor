        "1. e4 e5 2. Qh5": "Patzer opening.  Black usually does well with Nc6 here.",
        "2... Qe7": "This too is ok, provided white doesn't play Bc4.",
        "3. Nc3 g6 4. Qf3 h5 5. Bc4": "I kind of like Nd5 here, which threatens the black queen.  Black must then play Qd6 or Qc5 to defend against NxPc7+ which forks black's a rook.",
        "5... Nf6 6. Nh3 Qc5": "Nothing is defending against QxNf6.  Black must then protect the h rook, perhaps with Rh7 to protect against QxPf7+.  This gives white ample time to reposition the white bishop to safety, or defend it.",
        "7. d3": "The free knight looked a lot better to me.",
        "7... Ke7 8. Ng5 d5": "White has three (four counting the queen) pieces on d5, black only two.",
        "9. Nxd5+": "I think I like 9. BxPd5 better.  NxN, 10. BxN, QxPc2 11. Qf6+ lets white pick up black's h rook.",
        "9... Nxd5 10. exd5 Bg4 11. Qg3": "I prefer QxPf7+.  Black's choices are Kd8, in which case 12 Ne6+ picks off the black queen, or Kd6 which drives the black king into the battlefield.  Actually, Kd6 results with Ne4+ and again the black queen falls into darkness, trampled beneath the white knight's hooves.",
        "11... Qd4 12. c3 h4 13. cxd4 hxg3 14. dxe5 gxh2 15. f3 f6 16. Ne6 Na6": "Bg4 is worth more than Pc7.  BxNe6 would have defended against NxPc7.",
        "17. fxg4 fxe5 18. Bg5+ Kd7 19. Bxa6 Bb4+ 20. Kf2 c6 21. Bxb7 Rab8 22. a3 Bf8 23. Bxc6+ Kd6 24. Be3 Rxb2+ 25. Kf3 Rh7": "?  I would have moved Pa6 or Pa5.  Rh7 permits NxBf8 for free.",
        "26. Nxf8": "Actually, not for free.  I overlooked Rf7+.",
        "26... Rf7+": "Here we expect Kg3, RnNf8, RxPh2."
