It is surprising how much compensation Black gets for the pawn, but the variation is well known since the famous inaugural game Capablanca-Marshall in 1918.",
        "9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. Rxe5 c6 12. d4 Bd6": "All book to here. Now White has a choice of several moves: 13 Bxd5, Re1 and Re2 being the main ones.",
        "13. Re2": "I've played against the Marshall many times, both OTB and in correspondence. The 13 Re1 lines are OK with me, but I wanted to see what my opponent had ready against the less used text.",

After 25 Re1! in case of 25...Rxe1  26 Qxe1 Black cannot reply 26...Qxf3 due to 27 Qe8 mate. And if 25...Bxf1, then 26 Rxe8  Qxe8 27 Kxf1 leaves White just two pawns up with a won endgame.",
