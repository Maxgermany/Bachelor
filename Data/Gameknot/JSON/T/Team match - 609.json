        "5... c6": "I played incorrectly and if the pawn were taken, the effect of the King's Gambit would activate. Note that this opening is to start a queen side pawn storm.",
        "6. O-O": "I get a pawn back.",
        "6... cxd5 7. Bb3 Be6 8. Qe1 Bd6": "I protect the f5 pawn earlier because it looks like a better time saving move. Once the white bishop recaptures on f4, then the pawn storm is dominant.",

        "9... Nc6 10. c3 O-O 11. Nbd2": "Somewhat of a bad move here. I gain a  tempo after Ng4, as if the knight won't leave, I control e3, where my knight is said to be as powerful as a rook.",
        "11... Ng4 12. Nb1": "Controlling e3 again. I get a 2 move tempo, so I continue positionally advancing.",
