        "1. e4": "   1.e4  is the most common first move for white",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3": "  This move develops a piece and at the same time threatens the e5 pawn.",
        "2... Nc6": "   Black develops a piece and at the same time supports the e5 pawn",
        "3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4": "  This move initiates the Evans Gambit. The Evans Gambit happens to be \r\n  another old-time favorite. White sacrifices a pawn so that he can gain time by\r\n  pushing Black's Bishop around. Players these days prefer 4. d3 for a much \r\n  quieter game.",
        "4... Bxb4": "    Forced.",
        "5. c3": "   The point of this move is to  \r\n   1. Attack Black's Bishop\r\n   2. Getting ready to play 6.d4 ( which was played in the game)\r\n   3. Allowing the Queen access to the Q-side when it will go to b3 set up a \r\n       battery on the a2-g8 diagonal and attack Black's weakness ( the f7 pawn)",
        "5... Ba5": " The Bishop retreats.",
        "6. d4": "   Another pawn sacrifice.  White blows apart the center in the hope that the \r\n   new lines that are opened up give access to the Black King.",
        "6... exd4": " That is forced.",
        "7. O-O": "  White moves his King to safety.",
        "7... d3": "  Black just wastes time here because White is not really interested in wasting a\r\n  move to recapture the pawn.",
        "8. Qb3": "   White wastes no time at all!  He goes straight on the attack, creating a \r\n   battery on the a2-g8 diagonal and threatning 9.Bxf7 , which will win a pawn\r\n   and check the Black King.",
        "8... Qf6": "  Black defends the pawn on f7 but he places his Queen on a vulnerable square.",
        "9. e5": "  setting up the trap of  9. Nxe5 which leads to 10.Re1 d6  11. Nxe5 dxe5 \r\n  12. Qa4  and then 13.Qxa5 winning the Black bishop.",
        "9... Qg6": "  Black is correct to know that when your King is still in the center you should \r\n  avoid opening up any new files.",
        "10. Re1": "  Putting the Rook on the same file as Black's King.",
        "10... Nge7": "   Development is crucial and Black clears the way so that he can consider\r\n   o-o",
        "11. Ba3": "  Placing the bishop on a very powerful diagonal that leads towards Black's King.",
        "11... b5": "   Instead of getting his king to safety by 11.0-0, Black tries to counter-attack. \r\n   He has forgotten about the principle that you should not open lines when \r\n   your King is still in the center.",

        "12... Rb8": "  Attacking White's Queen.",

        "13... Bb6": "  To stop  14.Bxe7  Kxe7 leaving the King unable to castle ( 14. Nxe7 simpily just\r\n  drops the a5 bishop).",
        "14. Nbd2": "  Development.",
        "14... Bb7": " !  Putting the bishop on a powerful diagonal leading towards White's King.",
        "15. Ne4 Qf5": "  Black continues to waste even more time and just leaves his King in the center\r\n  where it is exposed to attack.",
        "16. Bxd3": "  Capturing the pawn and is also threatning 17. Nd6 , with a discovered attack \r\n  on Black's Queen.",
        "16... Qh5": "   Getting of the very dangerous b1-h7 diagonal.",
        "17. Nf6+": " Now as you can all see. White wants to force Black to take the Knight on f6\r\n ( If Black moves his King here then the White Knight will just take the Black \r\n  Queen on h5) The point behind White's sacrifice is so after 18. exf6 White has \r\n just blasted open the e-file and has gave the White  Rooks an invitation to join \r\n the hunt for Black's King. The possibility of opening up some lines against the \r\n enemy King should absolutly always be considered.",
        "17... gxf6": "   Forced move",

        "20. Rxe7+": " !   Bang",
        "20... Nxe7": " ?   White now has a forced mate. I think that Black overlooked White's stunning\r\n      reply. But a better defence would have been 20. Kd8!  21. Rxd7  Kc8 \r\n      22. Rd8 !  Kxd8 ( not 22. Nxd8 because that leads to 23.Qd7 !! Kxd7 \r\n      24. Bf5   and then followed by 25.Bd7 checkmate)  23. Bf5  Qxd1  \r\n      24. Qxd1  Nd4  25. g3  ( that defends the g2 pawn before taking the Knight\r\n      on d4- The Knight is pinned and will not jump away) 25. Bd5  26. cxd4\r\n      resulting into a won game for White.",

        "22... Ke8": "   If the Black King tried  to escape with 22. Kc6 then  23. Bd7 is checkmate.",
        "23. Bd7+ Kf8 24. Bxe7#": " Checkmate. This is the final position. Anderssen must have been quite fond of \r\n  checkmating his opponents by placing a Bishop on e7!"
