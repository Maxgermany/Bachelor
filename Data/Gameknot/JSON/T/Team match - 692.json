        "1. e4 e5 2. f4": "this f4 move take you into the King gambit. This  opening is full of risk for both sides. Generally one errror by either player can lead to an unrecoverable position.The early master killed this opening. If you search any data base about 75% TO 85% OF recorded King gambit games were played before 1950.",
        "2... exf4": "2.... this move into the King Gambit accepted.",
        "3. d4": "3. I would have prefered Knf3 to stop Qh4 . Chenrev states move the kns to f3, f6 c3 and c6 early and keep them posted. ",
        "3... Qh4+ 4. Kd2 Qf2+ 5. Qe2 Qxd4+": "5. picking up pawns- If you going to accept the gambit then go ahead and grab those pawn. ",
        "6. Qd3 Qf2+ 7. Qe2 Bb4+": "Now the bishop join the party! I wonder about this early bishop to b4 in so\r\nmany game because c3 pushes it back.",
        "8. c3 Bc5 9. Qxf2": "T\\I think this was a good capture for you.",
        "9... Bxf2 10. Nf3": "Good posting of the kn!",
        "10... Be3+ 11. Kc2 Nf6": "Good posting of the kn. If this kn would been develop prior to the bishop then you would have had more problems with that queen in your back ",
        "12. e5 Ng4": "I think d5 was better for the Kn",
        "13. Bc4 Bf2": "He trying to stop the development of your King rook but more development would have been better including castling king side. Nc6 give black two kn on e5 pawn. My son often tell me it bad to just let those kns linger in your bakyard.",
        "14. Bxf4": "he just letting you back in the game. He next 5-6 moves wer e every weak overall which aloow you to capture unprotect pieces and improve your develpment.",
        "14... d6 15. exd6": "he making muliple open file for you which you utilized to put extreme pressure on him.",

        "20. Nc4 Rf8": "This move was the blunder that took away any chance for black to regain any hope of winning. \r\n\r\nEssentially a premature attack and poor development by Black resulted in a trashing. I am certain a more attacking type player would have finished this game a lot quicker in about 35 moves.",
        "21. Bxf8 Bf5 22. Nxe3 Bxe3 23. Rd1+ Kc7": "You need to bring the queeen rook into the game.\r\nOverall a very good game!!!!!",
