        "7... O-O 8. Nbd2": "For a possible e4 push, additional support for a c4 push, or just a developing move.",
        "8... Re8 9. Ne5": "This time I chose Ne5, normally here I play 1 of 4 moves, c4, e4, a3, or Ne5.",
        "9... a6 10. f4": "Adding additional support to the e5 knight. It does create a hole on e4, but for now I'm controlling that square.",
        "10... Qc7 11. a3": "Preventing Nb4 ideas, which, in order to keep my double bishop pair, would force Be2 making it harder to do a kingside attack, which is my plan here.",
        "11... b5 12. dxc5": "Also to avoid being forced to retreat my bishop with 12...c4.",
        "12... Bxc5 13. Rf3": "Trying to get a kingside attack going, and protecting e3.",
        "13... Bd6": "? Totally missing my next two moves, which allow an easy kingside attack. I would have played something like Be7, protecting the f6-knight.",
        "14. Nxc6": "Uncovering my b2-bishop.",
        "14... Qxc6 15. Bxf6": "Opening his king up for an attack on the g-file.",
        "15... gxf6 16. Bxh7+": "For awhile I was planning on Rg1+ Kf8(Kh8 Qg4) Bxh2, with a passed h-pawn and him having a central king. But, then I thought, if he wanted to get checkmated, why not give him the option?",
        "16... Kxh7": "?? Best was Kf8.",
        "17. Rg3": "Limiting his king's maneuverability and threatening Qh5 mate.",
        "17... Kh6": "Either this or Bf8 was the only was to stop mate in 1.",
        "18. Qg4": "There is now no way to stop a checkmate on the h-file, so my opponent resigned. Thanks for reading, please feel free to comment and rate this annotation and let me know how I did!"
