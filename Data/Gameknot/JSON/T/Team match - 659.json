        "3... f5": "a stonewall f5-e6-d5",
        "4. Ne5": "the square e5 is weak (no black pawns can control it), so an early good place for the white knight. The black king lost freedom.",
        "4... Nh6": "prevent Qh5  g7 Kxg",
        "5. Be2": "probably not a good move, just I want to have the line h4-e8 and castle.",
        "5... g6 6. O-O": "and now the rook is ok to go on the game",
        "6... Bd6 7. d4": "like a stonewall, but the idea is to have the choice with d or f if the bishop take and continue development.",
        "7... g5": "risky, open h5-e8, open the column f for the white rook, help bishop-queen development.",

        "13... Bb4 14. c3": "the idea is close the e1 square for the black queen, if the bishop b4 move again the black queen will be trap",
