        "7. Nxd4 exd4 8. d3": "i like this move.  black's bishop is going no where, and f7 is still a viable attacking point",
        "8... O-O 9. Qh5": "i feel that this is a good square for my queen.  any thoughts?  attacking the bishop, and a g6 blunder allows Qxh6.  plus, nice parking spot until f7 is ready to go",

        "14... Qg3 15. h4 f5 16. e5": "i don't want black's rook active, so keeping that pawn on f5 on the f file is key.  also Qe6! is a good place, but I need black's queen off that diagonal because it's protecting the e5 and d6 squares which i intend to use.",
