        "1. e4": "Standard king's pawn. As white, I never play this, ever.",
        "1... d5": "Scandinavian. This is fun and exciting, but if white plays 2. e5, it becomes annoying to knock out the pawn.",
        "2. e5": "Aggressive.",
        "2... Nc6": "Standard development. 2. e5 e3 would also work.",
        "3. f4": "(?) Why not d4? 3. f4 weakens the kingside.",
        "3... e6 4. Bb5": "Pinning the knight to the king, as well as developing the kingside.",
        "4... Bd7 5. c3": "(!) Plans to play d4, creating a pawn chain, and aiming for Qa4.",
        "5... Bc5": "This frees up e7 for the knight, attacks f2, and develops the bishop.",
        "6. b4": "(?) d4 would have been better, as it blocks the a7-g1 diagonal, and creates a pawn chain.",
        "6... Bb6": "Running back to e7 would be pointless, so Bb6 is my only option.",
        "7. d4 Nge7": "Developing the knight, and getting ready to castle.",
        "8. Qg4": "(!) Obviously, the queenside is a wreck, and so white moves the queen to a strong position.",
        "8... Ng6": "This prevents any attempts for checkmate later in the game, opens the queen diagonal, and strengthens the kingside.",
        "9. Nf3": "The kingside is now safe, so white seizes the opportunity to castle.",
        "9... O-O 10. Nh4": "(?) This is basically giving black a knight.",
        "10... Qxh4+ 11. Qxh4 Nxh4 12. Nd2": "(?) Why not castle?",
        "12... Nxg2+ 13. Kf2 Nxf4": "Remember the old adage, eat a pawn chain from the back.",
        "14. Kf3 Ng6 15. a4": "Attempting to win a bishop.",
        "15... a6": "(!) A6 both rids the white bishop, and provides an escape route for the bishop.",
        "16. Bd3": "(?) White should have traded bishops. The black bishop on d7 is basically trapped, and white could move the dark bishop out, and it creates triple pawns for black.",
        "16... Nh4+": "(?) Probably pointless.",
        "17. Kg4 Ng2": "(?) The black knight is trapped. Nf5 or Ng6 would be better.",
        "18. Nf3 h5+": "(?) Pointless.",
        "19. Kxh5 g6+": "I made this move to lure the king closer. Flip the board and see how crowded black is.",
        "20. Kh6 g5": "(?) Pointless yet again.",
        "21. Rg1": "Attacks the knight, and after taking the knight, pinning the pawn. I can't move Nf4 or Nh4, because if the pin.",
        "21... f6": "I made this move to chip away at white's pawn chain.",
        "22. Rxg2 fxe5 23. Rxg5+": "And takes with a check. Though behind in material, white has the upper hand in position.",
        "23... Kh8 24. Nxe5": "Taking back the pawn.",
        "24... Nxe5 25. Rxe5 Rf3": "(!) Attacks the bishop and the h3 square.",
        "26. Bh7": "(?) Re3 would be better. This loses to 26. ... Rh3+ 27. Rh5 Rxh5 28. Kxh5 Kxh7.",
        "26... Rxc3": "(?) I didn't see the earlier move while I was playing.",
        "27. Rg5": "(?) Pointless?",
        "27... Rh3+ 28. Rh5 Rxh5+ 29. Kxh5 Kxh7 30. Bh6 c5": "I saw a potential trap. Do you see it?",
        "31. Rg1": "(?) Now white loses. Watch.",
        "31... Be8+ 32. Kh4 Bd8+": "(?) I should have took the bishop.",
        "33. Bg5 Bxg5+ 34. Rxg5 cxb4": "Is this the correct move, or would cxd be better? Please comment.",
        "35. Rg1": "Obviously to prevent promotion",
        "35... b5": "This is to open up the a file.",
        "36. a5 Bg6": "Protects b1.",
        "37. Kg5 b3 38. Rb1": "(?) Oops for white.",
        "38... Bxb1": "And now white resigns. Promotion is inevitable, and white's pawns are scattered."
