        "1. e4 e5 2. h4 Nc6": "Whenever a rook pawn is pushed two places, my favorite response is to open the bishop on the diagonal they might want to advance the rook.  It's an easy two points, if they make that mistake.",
        "3. c3 Bc5 4. b4 Be7 5. Qa4 a6 6. b5 a5": "I think I would have withdrawn the knight to Na7.  ",
        "7. bxc6 bxc6 8. Na3 Bxa3 9. Bxa3 Ne7 10. Bc4 O-O 11. Nf3 Bb7 12. Ng5 d5 13. exd5 cxd5 14. Bd3 g6 15. h5 Qd6": "Ugh.  What would have been mildly cool is d4, which focuses the black bishop on g2.  Though white could certainly interrupt with Be4, or f2.  At least black would be seizing the initiative.",
        "16. Bxd6 cxd6 17. hxg6 fxg6 18. Ne6 Rf6 19. Qd7": "White forks the rook and bishop with this move.  Bc8 may trade knights, but all even trades play to white's material advantage.  Actually, Bc8, 20. Qe8+, Rf8, 21. Qxf8#.  So never mind.",
        "19... Rf7 20. Qxb7 Re8 21. Ng5 Rg7 22. Qb5 Ra8 23. c4 e4 24. Be2 a4 25. cxd5 a3 26. Nxe4 Rd8 27. Nf6+ Kh8 28. Qb6 Rc8 29. Qxd6 Rf8 30. Bd3 Rxf6": "White's queen was protecting that knight.",
        "31. Qxf6 Nxd5 32. Qd8+ Rg8 33. Qxd5 Rg7 34. Rc1": "Black needs to move P7 to make room for the king to move, but down 18 this game is pretty much over.",
        "34... Rg8 35. Qe5+": "Here black must play Rg7, white answers with 36. Rc8#.\n"
