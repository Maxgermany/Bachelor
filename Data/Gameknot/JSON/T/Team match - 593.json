        "7... Nxe4": "black will win a piece, but must be very alert.  a similar sacrifice was played by Bronstein in '56 and his opponent missed the best continuation and white's pawns became too active for black to handle.",
        "8. Bb5+ c6 9. dxe4 cxb5 10. O-O Bd6 11. Qe2 f5": "active play is necessary here or black could get steamrolled by those pawns",
        "12. Nc3": "this isn't active enough.  white had to try 12 Qh5+ with a complicated game.",
        "12... O-O": "being willing to let that pawn go to get the king into safety.",
        "13. a3 a6 14. b3 Bd7 15. Bb2 b6 16. exf5 Bxf5 17. Ne4 Bxe4 18. Qxe4 Rf4 19. Qe3 Qc7 20. Rac1 Raf8": "hereabouts black starts to take control of the board",
        "21. Qd3 Nb7 22. b4 Rc4": "a powerful positional move which slaps a bind on white",

        "36. Qh4": "I was surprised white would allow a passed pawn like that.  after 36 fxe3 Nxe3 black had intended ... Qd4.  the plan was to take the queens off the board and win the pawns on the queenside.",
        "36... e2": "white can defend himself after the direct ... Qd1+",
        "37. f3": "this makes it easy.  f4 was necessary.  the key difference is that black wouldn't have the winning check on d6.",
