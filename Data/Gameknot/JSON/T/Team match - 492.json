        "17... Nf6": "Brings his knighty back into the game. Why did he move it in the first place? I thought he was trying to force the knight to retreat. But he never played f6. He's probably still wary about e4.",

        "27. Bf3": "Forcing the queen away. The queen can't do anything to defend his king now. I also win his rook with this move as well.",
