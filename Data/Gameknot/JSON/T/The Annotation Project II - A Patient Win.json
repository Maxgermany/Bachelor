        "1. f4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI have forgotten to annotate a couple of games in the Annotations Project Part 2. Both of these were against Class C Opposition.  I will remedy that right now.  The first one is against Graham (Goatfodder) who is a bit like The Dentist, i.e. ok up to late/middlegame and will then make a mistake that will let me into the game big time and then go on to win it.  I will start the commentary on Move 9 as the previous moves are fairly standard to this particular opening. ",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 Bg7": "9. ...... Bg7 - this move has turned out to be black's best reply due to the fact that Fou Lenoir bears down on the a1-h8 diagonal, making it awkward for a queenside fianchetto of the white dsb later on.",
        "10. Ne6": "10. Ne6 - a standard cramp.  Glenda goes to g8.  My rook is hemmed in but I may somehow be able to rectify this later on.",
        "10... Qg8 11. Nc3 Bxc3 12. bxc3": "12. bxc3 - Fou Lenoir is traded for one of the knights.  Hmm, I think I have made things easy for Graham as he now has the bishop pair!  Thankfully Graham is not the Master Mater!",
        "12... h5 13. Bh3 b6": "13. ...... b6 - I now try and find a bolt-hole for Henry.",
        "14. Bb2 Qf7": "14. ..... Qf7 - Glenda moves to f7 give my rook on h8 some leg room!",
        "15. Rf1 Na6": "15. ..... Na6 - bit worried about the WR and Glenda being on the same file.  I do a Risk Assessment and decide that she is OK there for now and decided to clear the decks on my back row.",
        "16. Nd4+ Kb7 17. Be6 Qe8 18. c4 Rd8": "18. ...... Rd8 - moves the rook out of a possible skewer on the h1-a8 diagonal.  It also paves the way for queenside castling by hand.",
        "19. Nb5 Rh7": "19. ...... Rh7 - evasive action from white's dsb on b2.",
        "20. Rd1 c6": "20. ...... c6 - kicks the knight away from b5.",
        "21. Nd4 Rd6 22. Bh3 Qf7": "22. .... Qf7 - Glenda returns to f7.",
        "23. d3 exd3 24. cxd3": "24. cxd3 - pawn trade.  White is covered at the moment but he must be a little careful.  All it may need is for Glenda or a rook to go to the e column and the WK will be caught in an Epaulet Mate!",
        "24... Nb4 25. g3 Rxd4": "25. ..... Rxd4 - I now formulate a two step plan to exchange my rook for B and N.  This will break up the bishop pair and give me bags of room!",
        "26. Bxd4 Nc2+": "26. ..... Nc2+ - stage 2 of the plan, a knight fork.  The bishop on d4 will drop next move.  Neat.",
        "27. Kf2 Nxd4 28. Rdb1 Kc7 29. Rfe1 c5": "29. .... c5 - I decided to support my knight which has a fine outpost on d4.",
        "30. a4 a5": "30.  ...... a5 - this prophylactic move is to ensure that the white rooks bite on granite!",
        "31. Re5 Qe8 32. Rbe1 Qxa4": "32. ..... Qxa4 - the white rooks double up on my e7 pawn but hallo, allo, allo.  Glenda is on the rampage.",
        "33. Rd5 Qc2+ 34. Kf1 Qxd3+": "34. ..... Qxd3+ - another p(r)awn for Henry's dining table tonight!",
        "35. Kf2 Qf3+ 36. Kg1 Ne2+": "36. ..... Ne2+ - trying to catch the WK in a mating net.  Graham must now give up his rook for my knight and I am already +6 in material!",
        "37. Rxe2 Qxe2 38. Rd7+ Kc6 39. Ra7 Qxc4": "39. ..... Qxc4 - Yet another p(r)awn - Henry will certainly not go hungry tonight!",
        "40. Bg2+ Kd6": "40. ..... Kd6 - but he must take some evasive action first.",
        "41. h4 Qd4+ 42. Kh2 Qf2": "42. ..... Qf2 - Glenda now tries to entomb the WK but allows him the squares of h1 and h3.  Must look out that I do not deliver the wrong kind of mate should the rooks disappear off the board.",
        "43. Kh3 c4 44. Ra8 c3": "44 ..... c3 - pawn run!",
        "45. Rd8+ Kc7 46. Rd3 Qb2 47. Be4 c2": "47. .... c2 - is this gonna be Glenda 2?",
        "48. Bxg6 c1=Q": "48. ..... c1/Q - yees it is!",
        "49. Bxh5": "49. Bxh5 - aha not Bxh7, I think we may have a stalemate try here.",
        "49... Rxh5 50. g4 Qh1+": "50. ...... Qh1+ - but Glenda 2 ensures I will not be denied!",
        "51. Kg3 Qbg2#": "51. ..... Qbg2# - it was Xmas Eve when gameknot announced that I delivered mate - the last move was set as a conditional - so a nice bit of festive cheer for me!  Hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne"
