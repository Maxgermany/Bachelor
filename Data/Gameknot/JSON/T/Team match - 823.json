    "moves": {
        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. h4": "Well, I don\u00b4t know. Sometimes it\u00b4s better a waiting until we have more pieces on the table.",
        "5... Nbd7 6. Be2 O-O": "Black would be confortable with a more desirable 6...e5 and if 7.d5 Nc5 wouldmake some room to counter attack white\u00b4s structure",
        "7. h5": "Off course you have to go with your plan, that\u00b4s the way",
        "7... c5 8. hxg6": "There is a problem of perspective here, seems like we are eroding black\u00b4s structure, but at the same time we are opening some lines for the opponent, like the f column, to win the h column, but the clearvoyance would fail before making a clear advantage. When there is not a certain perspective sometimes we prefer moves like 8.h6 to stay straight the path of the plan and wait for a psicological result. I don\u00b4t say that 8.hxg6 it\u00b4s not a good move, in fact it\u00b4s a good one, but as I said is a perspective view.",
        "8... fxg6 9. Nf3": "Oh my gosh. Changing plans in middle of the battle would be incongruent with the soul of chess, but with the human spirit. It seems like 9.d5 is a move with a few more chances, obviously you give the e5 point, but retain e6 and e7 and can try with f4, Nh3 and Qd3 to exploit the king side, and at last the f column is blocked before 0-0-0",
        "9... cxd4": "Off course! It doesn\u00b4t matter that there is a three pawn islands, but this position is more desirable to defend the e6 and e7 points",
        "10. Nxd4": "What kind of openning is this one? There\u00b4s not an easy answer to this question, just one thing remains: one move can change our life...",
        "10... Ne5": "... but I don\u00b4t think very good thinkings about this move. I would like 10...Nc5 against e4 and try to make a free world to the beasts living in g7 and c8. At last the white can\u00b4t move the b pawn without hazardous results.",
        "11. Bf4": "What kind of competition we are seeing! It\u00b4s like you are saying: \"No, I do the bad move-. No, I do the worst move-\". For Jesus! Did not see that after 11...Ne4 12.Ne4 Rf4 there is no a doubt about the more posible winner",
        "11... Qc7": "Yesss! Oh gosh! It\u00b4s like the football team against us failing a penalty! After this move white can reorder the pieces with Ndb5 and Be3 or Bd2 to regain control",
        "12. Qb3": "Looks very aggresive, but with 12...Ne4 (again) there is an open f column and a weak g7-d4 diagonal to exploit",
        "12... Qc5": "Well white, as chess player, you are a good poker player ;), because black did think that you had a joker underwear with c5. Now, in this instance, recover power with 13.Be3 and the queen has to fly quickly",
        "13. O-O-O": "All right white I\u00b4m asking you: Do you like that queen in c5?",
        "13... Nc6 14. Be3": "Ufff! How it\u00b4s possible to lose here? Not in this world!",
        "14... Qe5": "I will call this queen, the Nomad Queen. Because 15.Nf3 and 16.Ng5 she is helping our best attack position",
        "15. Nf3 Qe6 16. Ng5 Qe5": "Well Luke, all the planets are aligned, as your head astrologist I say you will destroy some castles. At this time the a2-g8 diagonal belongs to white",
        "17. Nd5": "Hey luke, please don\u00b4t abandon your plan in the middle of the battle!! The best of the best of the best move is 17.c5! o even the magnificent 17.f4! and the Nomad Queen would go to 17...Qa4, and after 18.c5! there is no time to cry for black. 17.Nd5 is not bad, only close our beloved a2-g8 diagonal",
        "17... Nxd5 18. cxd5": "I like 18.Rd5 because leave the hot move c5 alive, and remember the Nomad Queen has to walk. Off course 18.cxd5 leaves open the c column to the remaining a8 tower",
        "18... Na5": "Yep, black has the right to give back one punch",
        "19. Qb4 b6 20. Rxh7": "20.Nxh7! and keep the attack",
        "20... Rxf2": "After this move I just only have to say THANK YOU BLACK! Why are you so comprensive? I did wait for this moment since the beginning of the times! And the moment of glory comes when white play 21.Rxg7! How many pieces are very important for black? How many are in good shape? Just the Nomad Queen and the terrible beast in g7. Then, at this moment I say: get out of here black bishop and thanks for the rook in f2",
        "21. Qd2": "What\u00b4s up man? Are you crazy? What kind of demons did you see? Or it was just a moment of incredible weakness?",
        "21... Rxg2": "Off course 21...Nc4 would be deffinitive",
        "22. Nf3": "Noooo, fellow, you still had 22.Rg7 to rescue some of the board",
        "22... Qxb2+": "I don\u00b4t know about your football club, but, well, it\u00b4s like to see Manchester United losing against Aston Villa by 0-1 in the last minute, and the last words in our head is: \"How I did not see?\""
