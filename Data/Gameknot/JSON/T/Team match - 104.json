        "8. Bc4": "QxPg2 hurts white.",
        "8... Qe4+ 9. Qe3": "Oops, this leaves the bishop undefended.  Black should play QxBc4.\n",

        "10... Qxe3+ 11. dxe3 Be6": "White splits black's pawns by trading bishops.  Split pawns are harder for black to defend.\n",
        "12. b3 Nc6 13. Nf3 a6 14. O-O Bd6 15. Nd5": "Black has more power here (bishop plus knight), this sacrifices the knight for nought.\n",
        "15... Bxd5 16. a4 Bxf3": "Black breaks white's castle, doubling pawns.",
        "17. gxf3 Rab8": "Rad8 probably would likely have been better.  Rook on center file exerts greater control over the battlefield.\n",
        "18. f4 Ne7 19. h4 Nh5 20. e4": "Withdrawing cover for Pf4 gives black this pawn.  White's black bishop cannot compete against black's knight and bishop.\n",
        "20... Ng6": "Black would have been better off taking the pawn.  The other pawn, h4, is easy pickings.\n",
        "21. f5 Ne5": "NxPh4 seems better.\n",
        "22. f4 Nd7": "All even trades now favor black, given the knight advantage.  NxBc4 also splits white pawns.",
        "23. f6": "Two knights chomp this bit.  But it is a clever ruse, allowing whit to pawn fork black.  Still, NdxPf6 works, because bc5+ let's black escape the fork.\n\n\n",
        "23... Nhxf6 24. e5 Ne4": "Nope.  When forked, counter threat.\n",
        "25. Bd3 Ng3": "Rf3 keeps pressure on the knight.  White will make back a bishop or knight.\n",
        "26. Rf3 Nh5 27. Bf5 f6 28. exd6": "Good choice.\n",
        "28... Rfd8": "Yikes!  PxPc7 forks black's rooks!  Blunder!\n",
        "29. dxc7 Nf8 30. cxd8=Q": "The other rook robs black's control over the center.\n",
