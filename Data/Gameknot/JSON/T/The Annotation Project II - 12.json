        "1. f4": "A game played a little while ago v's Jullian. \r\n\r\nOne of my first games and I think I caught him a little cold and got in a sneaky fork.\r\n\r\nI am sure he hasn't and wouldn't miss it again & therefore I'm quite lucky to rack this one up as a victory.\r\n\r\nI was soundly beaten in the away leg so he more than made up for it :)",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+": "And so we commence.",
        "8... Kc6": "Seems to be the 'book' move now.",
        "9. Bxg4": "(After the 2nd game Jullian mentioned that as blacks King is out in the open & white still retains both Knights & both Bishops Black (presuming that there Queen will be out as well) has to tred carefully due to a massive number of Forks & Pins that could easily lead to a lost Queen) ",
        "9... e5": "I've seen this move in a few other games. I noticed a nice little combination played in other game. (so I nicked it!).\r\n\r\nTo be fair I've played this as White in the past few games, I know some of the better players prefer to put there DSB on g7 and Queen on g8, personally I feel to trapped and haven't the know how to break free.",
        "10. Nf7 Qe7 11. Nxe5+": "Wins the pawn and puts in a check to boot.\r\n\r\nAlso leaves blacks e pawn hanging.",
        "11... Kb6": "Fork (King & Queen) on d5 with Knight if I can get there quick enough.",
        "12. g3": "But 1st wanted to protect against Qh4+ and loosing my bishop. Hopefully this will keep Queen sat where she is.\r\n\r\n",
        "12... Bg7": "Putting pressure on my advanced knight.\r\n",
        "13. Nc3": "Develop my 2nd knight. ",
        "13... Bxe5": "Black is too occupied with advanced Knight & misses the fork. Presume he feels he can exchange & win a pawn with a centralized Queen.",
        "14. Nd5+": "Killer blow? not yet but hopefully will go a long way towards it.",
        "14... Kc6": "Is this wrong? \r\n\r\nI understand he wants to come back towards the center but if that was the case then surely c5 was better as isn't forced to move King..\r\n\r\nAlthough if the King was going to be the key piece to rewin the knight maybe the forced move doesn't matter?\r\n\r\nDoes mean that I'll beable to win the DSB & pass a pawn. \r\n\r\nMaybe black would have been better to cut loses and head to a6?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n",
        "15. Nxe7+": "Gives me more time & loses black more tempo with the check",
        "15... Kd6": "There is no way I can keep my knight but I don't want to give him away for free so must cause as much trouble as poss.",
        "16. Nc8+": "Also means I might beable to hang on to my passed pawn which if nothing else may give black more cause for concern.",
        "16... Kd5": "Pawn looks like he won't beable to hang on. \r\n\r\nBlacks King is central, hopefully this makes him an easy target, although he maybe hard to pin down and I'm figuring Black wants to use him to attack?",
        "17. fxe5": "Pick up my free bishop.",
        "17... Nc6": "Again I think black was better taking pawn here as my knight wasn't going anywhere. ",
        "18. Ne7+": "Decide that this is my best move. It maneuvers blacks Knight backwards into a less favourable position and lose a bit of forward momentum. He was going to go anyway so figured there was little else to do.\r\n\r\n",
        "18... Nxe7 19. e6": "Also allowed me to advance pawn further where he was protected by Bishop, this pawn could be a real thorn in blacks side. Although his passed pawn had to be watched. I was still feeling this game could be vey drawish as if I exchanged all the pieces from here on in I would still prob only end up a bishop better off which wouldn't be enough to win. I found this quite depressing as I had won back the Queen with a nice fork.",
        "19... h5": "pushing back bishop. Still if I lose my pawn I can win blacks passed one.",
        "20. Bh3 g5": "looking to pin back bishop. looking likely that this pawn exchange is on the cards.",
        "21. b3": "Want to get my DSB into play. d3 or d4 would/could have created probems with my pawn chain which could be vital come the end game.",
        "21... Rhe8": "protecting from Ba3 and getting out of the way of Bb2 early. Although if black had put this move off it would have wasted tempo for white having to make 2 moves to get to a3. It does put weight on my pawn.",
        "22. Ba3": "Decide to add pressure ",
        "22... g4": "Alas my pawn has gone, but he has brought me time & tempo as black had to take care of it.",
        "23. Bg2": "exchange is looking on. Blacks prawn is pinned.",
        "23... Nc6": "Pawn is stranded. ",
        "24. d3 Rxe6 25. dxe4+": "white regains another passed pawn.",
        "25... Kd4 26. O-O-O+": "White castles. Gets king safe and puts in a check. Even though development wise up untill now there was no real difference white has managed to maintain all the running forcing black to react.",
        "26... Ke3": " I think Ke5 would have been better and force white to push extra pawn home.",
        "27. Bc5+ Ke2": "Kd4 would have prolonged it by an extra move.",
        "28. Rhe1#": "Game white.\r\n\r\nThanks for the game Jullian."
