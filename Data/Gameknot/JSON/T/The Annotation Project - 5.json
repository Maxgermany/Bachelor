        "1. e4": "A move as common as sunrise.",
        "1... c5": "Sicilian, I see it a lot in expert play, and I have been playing it more frequently lately.  I figure if the big boys play it, it must be good!",
        "2. f4": "This is the Grand Prix Attack. ",
        "2... d5": "Pretty standard play so far. ",
        "3. Nf3 dxe4": "The knight has to go somewhere. Standard chess dogma tells us that moving a piece twice before developing the other pieces is not the best practice. ",
        "4. Ng5": "As good a spot as any for the knight.  Better than going back to the home square any day. ",
        "4... Nf6": "Black develops a knight, guards the advancing pawn on the e file and clears a spot kingside perhaps in hopes of a castle later. Having played this game, I know that is a dream. ",
        "5. Bc4": "White is throwing some firepower at f7. Makes 4 Ng5 look a lot smarter!",
        "5... Bg4": "Black goes after the White Queen. With White's f pawn advanced so far the queen can only be protected by the knight or bishop which means \"backward advancement\" for white!",
        "6. Qxg4": "What?",
        "6... Nxg4": "well, D'oh!  Thanks for the queen white, nice trade! But white has plans for the double attack on f7. White seems to believe that the positional advantage was worth the Queen. ",
        "7. Bxf7+": " This is the first move by the \"real\" players. Yikes! Was my first impression of Blacks position when these games started. As black, I felt like I was in trouble, even with the queen advantage! ",
        "7... Kd7": "The only possible move. ",
        "8. Be6+": "White gets a little material back with this move. ",
        "8... Kc6": "I choose the move c6 over c7 to keep the c pawn close and to allow escape into the corner after clearing the Queen's Knight and rook and a6 ... that was my idea anyhow.",
        "9. Bxg4": "Bye Bye knight! now black is only up 3 points, but the queen advantage is helpful. White is still in good position and black's defenses are pretty shaky. ",
        "9... g6": "I'll be honest, I moved here because it was the most popular move in the GK DB. I was worried about Ne6, but that should result in trading bishop for bishop and white must be careful about trading to blithely due to the queen deficit. ",
        "10. Nc3": "White prepares to castle. Without a queen in the fray, protecting the King is paramount!",
        "10... Na6": "Clearing space for my king on the home row, I hope I can manage to get him back there!",
        "11. Ngxe4 e6": "Giving away this pawn, but the black diagonals it blocked had to be cleared.",
        "12. Bxe6": "Now only one point up... have I squandered the queen advantage? ",
        "12... Nb4": "I see a chance for a King / Rook fork.",
        "13. O-O": "Damn, that plan was dashed quickly!",
        "13... Nxc2": "Still, a pawn is a pawn, and I need to gain all the material I can!",
        "14. Bd5+ Kd7": "Not sure if that was really the right place for the King, but I didn't like the prospect of ...Kc7 15. Nb5+",
        "15. d4": "I think he threw the pawn out hoping I'd miss the dangling rook.",
        "15... Nxa1": "but I didn't.",
        "16. Be3 Nc2": "Right back where I started, and attacking the bs bishop, as well as the d pawn.",
        "17. Bf2": "The only sensible move in my estimation. ",
        "17... cxd4 18. Nb5": "A lot of white pieces in my area, I don't really like that, but my material advantage is much better with the rook in the bag.",
        "18... Ne3": "It's to my advantage to trade pieces now. And the fork is rather nasty with his ws bishop unprotected.",
        "19. Rc1": "? I think BxN would have been the better move, at least he white would not go down another whole piece. ",
        "19... Nxd5": "Thank you very much!!",
        "20. Bxd4": "The passed pawn could have been troublesome, but white's material advantage is beginning to take it's toll on black.",
        "20... Rg8": "lining up on his King.",
        "21. Rd1 Qa5": "Trying to force the N@b5 back. ",
        "22. Nf6+ Kc6 23. Nxd5": "It's unclear to me why White did not nab the rook.",
        "23... Qxb5": "Even trade. Exactly what white did NOT need.",
        "24. Nf6": "I think I'll move the rook @ g8. ",
        "24... Rg7 25. Rc1+ Kd6": "I don't like playing with my King in the wide open like this. White has a couple of chances for check.  Plus, I have a rook that seems to be paralyzed in corner... never good to leave the big iron out of the fray!",
        "26. Be5+ Ke6": "Hiding behind his pieces is about my only option here.",
        "27. Re1": "White wants a discovered check. ",
        "27... Re7": "I have to get my rooks involved, so I allow the discovered check.",
        "28. Bc3+ Kf7": "White can't trade rooks at this point. ",
        "29. Rf1 Re6": "Opening the diagonal for my bs bishop.",
        "30. Nxh7": "A last ditch effort. ",
        "30... Bc5+": "he can lose the rook with Rf2, or the game with Kh1. A good game, and an interesting gambit by white in the beginning. "
