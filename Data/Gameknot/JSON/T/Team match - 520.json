        "1. e4": "This is a strong move. This controls the center and gives room for development.",
        "1... e5": "This does the same but also resists my control of the center.",
        "2. Nf3": "This attacks the pawn and develops a piece.",
        "2... f6": "This is the Damianov's Defense. This is not a good opening for black because this weakens the king-side.",
        "3. Nxe5": "Another option is d4. I choose this because this leads to more unpredictable games and has a trap to it.",
        "3... fxe5": "Not a good move. Qe7 would be better rather than falling into a trap.",
        "4. Qh5+": "This attacks the e-pawn.",
        "4... Ke7": "If g6, Qxe5+ will win the rook. This is worse than losing the rook.",
        "5. Qxe5+": "I win the pawn and move his king again.",
        "5... Kf7": "The only move, moving towards the corner.",
        "6. Bc4+": "This forces the king to move farther.",
        "6... Kg6": "An OK move, either way black should lose fast.",
        "7. Qf5+": "I move the king farther.",
        "7... Kh6": "The king is trapped.",
        "8. d4+": "I take control of the center with a check.",
        "8... g5": "Now g7 is playable.",
        "9. h4": "I do not remember what to do here, but I think this is right. I make a discovered check and pressure a pin.",
        "9... d6": "I was thinking d5 or Kg7. This loses faster.",
        "10. Bxg5+": "I capture and I win fast.",
        "10... Qxg5": "If Kg7, Qf7#. If Kh5, g4#.",
        "11. Qxg5#": "And I win like that. In this game, you saw an opening trap and the downfall of an opening due to one move."
