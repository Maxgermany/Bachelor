        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ne4": "I was betting than you would do 3...Ng4 and after Bb4 , Qe7 and Nc6 you would see all of the pressure against that bold e pawn and justify that gambit",
        "4. Nd2 Nc5 5. a3 a5": "Well I think this is an unnecesary move because you will go with Ne6 anyway, then 5...d6 has more chances 'cus you open all of the lines to the bishops",
        "6. Nb3 Nc6 7. Nf3 Ne6": "although I have said this move before, right now it\u00b4s better to continue with 7...Nxb3 to make some queen deviation and avoid b4 from white to let 8...Bc4",
        "8. e3 d6 9. exd6 Bxd6": "Why not 9...Qd6 ?",
        "10. Nbd4 Ncxd4 11. exd4 O-O 12. c5 Bf4 13. Bc4 Re8": "At this time 13...Qf6 would get some counter attack against d column",
        "14. O-O Bxc1 15. Rxc1 Ng5 16. Nxg5": "Well, white feels very trusted, but 16.h4 or 16.Ne5 would be a devastating move to black",
        "16... Qxg5 17. Qb3": "Obviously white knows the weak point",
        "17... a4": "first 17...Qf6",
        "18. Bxf7+ Kh8 19. Qg3 Qxg3 20. fxg3 Rd8": "More proactive 20...Rf8",
        "21. Rce1 Bd7": "Don't worry, there is not checkmat... yet. I think 21...c6 before because the move d5 is definitive",
        "22. Re7": "Well, he doesn't want 22.d5! and after 22...Bb5, 23.Rf4 and Rb4 could control all of the black space",
        "22... Bc6 23. Rf4 g5 24. Rg4 Rac8 25. Be6": "Well, although there is some playing with 25...Re8, after 26.Rxe8 Rxe8, 27.d5 Bb5 and 28.Rxg5 there is no more game to the black pieces"
