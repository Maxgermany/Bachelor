        "4... Qe7": "This early Queen move is permissible because it does not expose Black's Queen to attack and because it is part of a plan to maintain Black's hold on the center.",
        "5. O-O d6 6. d4 Bb6 7. a4": "This move threatens 8 P-R5 winning material. If 8... BxRP? 9 P-Q5 N-N1 10 RxB, or if 8 ,,,NxRP 9 RxN BxR 10 Q-R4 ch and 11 QxB.",
