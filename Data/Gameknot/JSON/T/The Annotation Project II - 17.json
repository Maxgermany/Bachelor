I hope to gain insight into how I may have performed just a bit better against our esteemed host.  I look back at this move, so early in the game, feel like I could not have done any worse, should I had just played 11. ktxb... qxkt, then 12 kt-c3.... etc.",
        "11... h5": "At that precise moment, I felt a bit annoyed with this move, as it forced me to h-3, thus narrowing the mobility of my light b.",
        "12. Bh3 Na6": "I suppose I knew that kt-c5 was coming, but I chose to stick my head in the sand and imagine how my game would blossom beautifully with 13. c-3, 14 b-4....",
        "13. c3 Nc5 14. Nxc5 Kxc5": "Why I decided to play kt-a3 instead of what I now consider a much better move of b2-b4 check, I will have to reflect upon and look deep down inside of my soul.  Because I now see b2-b4 check as a much more superior move to the played in the game.",
        "15. Na3 Qb3": "Thx Freddy.  You make my point so clear.  With that one move, Freddy has me wrapped up in a cocoon of paralysis.  I know that I have some sort of knowledge of chess, but at this precise moment, the only thing that comforts me in this game is that i am playing Freddy, and he is a very good player, and that I have enough game to realize that I am really in deep doo-doo here.",
        "16. Nb5": "Yeah, that's right.  I was not the least bit interested in giving my game any attempt at any sort of breathing room with 16. d2-d3.  No.  Allow myself to watch this game be played out in Hitchcocktonian terror.",
        "16... Kb6 17. O-O a6 18. Nd4 Bxd4+ 19. cxd4 g5 20. fxg5 Raf8": "although it is a bit belated, I realize that the moment of judgment has already passed.  I have done nothing of note in this, my first complete game of the annotation project.  My opponent has made me feel like an impotent soldier who fired blanks at the enemy.  Alas, I had no plan for this game, and it showed.",
        "21. Re1 Qf7": "I have enough game to realize that this one is over for white.  Good game Freddy.  I say that, but I am sure there is very little true satisfaction for you here.  I will endeavor to find that link to the five basic tenets of which you mentioned to me after this total desultory performance of mine. I am down, but not out."
