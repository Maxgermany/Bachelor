        "1. e4": "This represents my final game in this mini-tourney.  In my previous game against nuntar, he was victorious.  I had hopes of doing better this time.  As usual, the action begins on move 8.",
        "1... c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6": "Black chooses the c6 option for his King.",
        "9. Bxg4 e6 10. Nc3": "I choose to develop my N rather than take e6.",
        "10... Na6 11. a3": "11.a3 - As has been noted many times, it is important to prevent Black from playing Nb4-c2.",
        "11... Qf6 12. Ncxe4": "As I have learned, the key for White in this opening is to develop quickly to take advantage of the Q sac and to keep Black from having an active Queen.  ",
        "12... Qxf4 13. Bf3": "13. Bf3  Obviously threatening check with the Bishop.",
        "13... Kd7 14. d3": "14. d3  This move both aids in developing the DSB as well as attacking the Q with tempo.",
        "14... Qf5 15. O-O": "15 O-O   White moves the King to relative safety, develops the Rook and threatens the Queen.",
        "15... Be7": "15...Be7 develops the Bishop while threatening White's Knight.  It is almost a certainty that Black would have exchanged his B for White's Knight.",
        "16. Ng3": "However, White again attacks the Queen.",
        "16... Qe5 17. Nf7": "17. Nf7 forks Black's Q and R, forcing the Queen to move again.",
        "17... Qd4+ 18. Kh1 b6": "18...b6  This move surprised me.  I expected Black to move Rh8 to safety.  Instead, White now has the option of exchanging his LSB for Ra8.  However, I wanted to keep my Bishop pair as I have learned (the hard way) how important the Bishop pair is for white in this tourney.",
        "19. c3": "19. c3  I liked this move as it again forces the Queen away.  At this point, there are very few safe squares for the Q.  ",
        "19... Qa4 20. Bd1": "20. Bd1  With this move, Black's Queen is no longer playing a significant role in the game.  I'm not as developed as I would like, but I've accomplished one of my goals.",
        "20... Qa5 21. Nxh8": "21 Nxh8  I thought about this move for awhile as I hated to give up a developed piece for an undeveloped piece but I reasoned that I had to make up the material.",
        "21... Rxh8 22. Rf7": "22. Rf7 pins the B and threatens the pawn.",
        "22... h6 23. Rxg7": "The material is now \"equal,\" Black's Q is marginalized, but White still needs to bring his pieces into play.",
        "23... Kd8 24. Bg4 Nc7 25. Bf4 b5": "At this point, I'm feeling pretty good about my position and my chances.",
        "26. Be5": "26. Be5 obviously attacking Rh8 while centralizing my DSB and halting any advance of e6.",
        "26... Rf8 27. Ne4": "27.  White is beginning to close in around Black's King.",
        "27... Nd5 28. g3": "28. g3  After this game, nuntar said that he thought this move was \"rather aimless\" and he wondered whether I thought my position was winning because of this move.  As I told him:   I moved 28. g3 to keep your Knight from f4 (and to give my King a bit of breathing room). My concern was that if the N went to f4, it could then attack d3 or force me to move it to d4. After that, I could see my pawn structure going into disarray, allowing your Queen freedom to move toward my King. The other option would have been to exchange my DSB for the N if it got to f4, but I certainly didn't like that option.--I looked at Bxe6 but I believe Black would definitely have moved Nf4, forking Be6 and d3.  I felt I had the time and position to be patient.\n\n",
        "28... Qb6": "It was at this point that Black offered a draw.  I liked my position but thought perhaps I was missing something.  I declined the draw as I felt I had some pressure building around Black's King and I had not even developed Ra1.  It turns out that nuntar offered the draw because he thought there was a possibility that I did not see my position as \"winning.\"  ",
        "29. Re1": "29 Re1.  This prevents his N from moving to e3 while it developed my Rook.  In fact, the only safe move for Black's N was c7.",
        "29... Nf6": "29...Nf6 surprised me as now I felt my position had gone from a good to winning.",
        "30. Nxf6 Rxf6": "30...Rxf6--I expected 30...Bxf6 which would have been followed by 31.\tBc7+\tQxc7\n32.\tRxc7\tKxc7\n33.\tRxe6  giving White a 2-pawn advantage in the endgame.  Instead, Black took with the Rook and then resigned.  I saw the continuation as 31. Bxf6 Bxf6  32. Rg8+ and then a multitude of problems for Black.\n\nAs I noted, this was my last game in this tourney.  With the win, I secured 3rd place behind freddy and joanne.  This was a wonderful learning experience and my thanks to freddy for inviting me and and to everyone who participated in the tourney.  I look forward to seeing all of you across the board!"
