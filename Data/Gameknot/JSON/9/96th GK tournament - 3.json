        "1. e4": "King Ends, from where He Starts.\nThis game is not too much complicate but there are few tactics worth notice.\nAnd specially Kings Journey (thats why i bother myself to write this notation)",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4": "Ruy Lopez, All Books move.",
        "4... f6": "This is 1st bad move.\nWhat White should do.\nOne line is Knight's sacrifice, thats happen in some cases when Black play f6.\nfor example BxN, dxB. Nxe5!?, fxN and then Qh5+\nif g6, Qxe5+ and Black loses Rook at h8 and may be more material.\nif Kd7 then White can win two pawns (Qxe5) for Knight, and Blacks expose position and Unable_Castling.\nThat could be interesting but sometimes after exchanging Queens, Black could do fine.",
        "5. d4": "So i decided play safe.\n(bcz few days ago before this game i played Blits and could not get advantage, in a line of Knight's sacrifice when Black played Kd7)",
        "5... exd4 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 7. Qxd4": "This excange favors white, as\nmore control of center and Queen got good position.",
        "7... Bd6": "2nd weak move from Black.",
        "8. O-O": "White castles and his plan is to expose center and stop Black from castling.\nSo white casltes to save his king and more importantly put his rook in center.",
        "8... Ne7 9. Bb3": "Stops castling!",
        "9... Nc6 10. Qd5": "Threatening checkmate at f7.",
        "10... Rf8": "Stops castling forever to kingside.\nBlack was in any case helpless. if Qe7 (it could be better)\nbut then there were risks of Black's King and Queen and White's Rook in same File after Re1.",
        "11. Qh5+": "threat to capture pawn at h7.\nFirst material advantage.",
        "11... Ke7 12. Nc3": "Qxh7 could be ok.\nBut from human's perspective when King is center force him more to come downwards.\nThreat is now simply Nd5+",
        "12... Nd4 13. Nd5+ Ke6 14. Nxc7+": "Double Check!",
        "14... Ke7": "Idea to capture c7 pawn was not winning pawn, but actually removing Bishop's support.\nBlacks Rook is hanging at a8.\nBut i was not thinking about, i was thinking simply checkmate as King can be forced to come in center.",
        "15. Nd5+ Ke6": "Only square.",
        "16. f4": "!",
        "16... Nxb3": "Black takes dangerous bisop. \nIn this position Computer says it's mate in 7.\nSo its a good position as a Problem.",
        "17. f5+": "sure this is the first move.\nthat was a move intended when played f4. and gave a good white bisop.",
        "17... Ke5": "forced.",
        "18. Bf4+ Kxe4 19. Qf3+": "it was actually 19. Nc3+ move to proceed properly.\n",
        "19... Kxf5 20. Bxd6+": "White is down a pawn in material. But Computer says White has +9 advantage.\n",
        "20... Kg6": "Better was Ke6, then Bc7.",
        "21. Nf4+": "From here all Blacks reply leads to checkmate in one or two. except the one that was played.",
        "21... Kf7 22. Qd5+": "It was pretty good manoeuvre, Knight moves at gives check and empty the square for Queen for next move.\nBut better was QxN+: winning knight and fulfilling the same purpose.",
        "22... Ke8": "Its mate in 5 from this postion.\nlook yourself or check calculation below.\nfirst manoeuvre your queen from Qe4+ (Kf7) to Qc4+ (Ke8)\nRae1+, ... Qe7. Rxe7+ Kd8 and Qc7#",
        "23. Rae1+": "Black resigns.\nHe is going to lose his queen, no more fun to play.\n\"King roamed all the world and died at home.\""
