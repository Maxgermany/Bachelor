        "1... e5 2. g3": "i decided to play something unusual for me: the control of light squares.",
        "2... Nf6 3. Bg2 c6 4. Nc3": "well, i control, he controls",
        "4... d5": "we all control",
        "5. cxd5 cxd5 6. d4": "destructuring the center. I am not sure it is correct, but I secretely hoped to isolate his pawn, even at a cost of a tempo: exd 7. Qxd4 Nc6 8. Qd1.",
        "6... e4": "but of course no... my plans never work",
        "7. Bg5": "so now other plan: i have a useless bishop, i still have a good control on light square... i want to destroy these pawns... I had a few moves to make.",
        "7... Be7 8. e3 Nc6 9. Nge2": "now, my plans were to put my knight on f5, takes his f-knight and capture the center pawns.",
        "9... Bg4": "... but i had to delay this plan",
        "10. Qb3": "could even be better",
        "10... Bxe2": "eliminating one of the potential \"taker\"",
        "11. Kxe2": "Haha! I surprised you, buddy! I thought that the only problem my king could have by not catling here was the opposite queen,,, which i had planned to exchange in the next few moves...",
        "11... Na5": "this is a huge mistake, giving me a tempo",
        "12. Qb5+ Nc6 13. Bxf6": "accomplishing my plan, delayed for a long time!",
        "13... Bxf6 14. Qxd5": "now, I want to exchange and take the second pawn, if it is possible.",

        "20. Rc2 b5 21. Be4": "the plan to pin my horse is a bit slow",

        "22... a6": "too slow",
        "23. a3 Nc6 24. Bxc6": "I hate horses when they are my opponent's... :-)",
        "24... Rxc6 25. Ne4 Rdc8": "doubled: this means although I am 2 pawns ahead, I am defending again...",
        "26. Kg2": "this is my second huge mistake. Ke2 was of course necessary",
        "26... Rc6c2 27. Rxc2 Rxc2": "now he is in... but only one rook: no panic",
        "28. b4 f5": "anyway, I intended to exchange the horse with the bishop",
        "29. Nc5 Bxc5": "and so it is done.",
        "30. bxc5": "here I hesitated... and actually it turned to be dangerous. Although the next moves are mostly mistakes, I wonder if, anyway, letting him a majority on a-b side is or not a huge mistake.",
        "30... Kf7": "logical.",
        "31. Kf3": "logical",
        "31... Ke6": "logical",
        "32. a4": "well, less logical, but I was at a loss of ideas... I should have played h3, then g4... but TIME!!!",
        "32... b4": "of course!!! now he is the dangerous one!",
        "33. Rb1": "forced but expecting a5...",
        "33... Rc4": "And he made THE mistake!!!",
        "34. a5": "of course! to prevent a5 now!",
        "34... g5 35. Kg2": "why on earth did I do that??? totally unnecessary... but not too dangerous",
        "35... h5 36. Rb3": "provonking...",
        "36... Kd5 37. Kf3": "where i belonged!!!",
        "37... Ke6": "he may think of a draw, now",
        "38. h3": "but i don't",
        "38... Kd5 39. g4 fxg4+ 40. hxg4 h4": "and i create a new threat for myself!!!! ",
        "41. Kg2 Ke4": "could have been worse...",
        "42. f3+": "expelling the king, but creating a weakness on e3...",
        "42... Kd5 43. Kh3 Rc3": "and now his Rc3 is a good move.",
        "44. Rxb4": "ouf... one threat is gone",
        "44... Rxe3": "but now, i have a new weakness on d4",
        "45. Kg2 Re2+": "unnecessary, i guess",
        "46. Kf1 Ra2": "this is more accurate",
        "47. Rb6": "threatening two moves... but i was expecting Rxd4, because if i take the a6 pawn, he takes my c-pawn, and then my a pawn falls... and he turns better...",
        "47... Rxa5": "and this is his biggest mistake. Now, I win!",
        "48. Rd6+": "and that is why!",
        "48... Kc4 49. c6": "byebye buddy boy",
        "49... Ra1+": "compensating...",
        "50. Kg2 Ra2+": "compensating",

        "51... Ra1": "unnecessary",
        "52. c7": "hello dolly",
        "52... Kd3 53. c8=Q": "Unless you see something I did not... this is the end...",
        "53... Ke3 54. Qc3+ Kf4 55. Rf6#": "and even d4 plays a role in this mate situation. Thank you brave pawns!"
