        "1. e4 c5": "Book opening: Sicilian defense...",
        "2. Nf3 d6 3. d4": "I like to go after the center early, so I usually will end up pushing both e4 and d4; although I open myself up, most players don't capitalize on this opportunity",
        "3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. Bd3 Be7 8. O-O": "I figure my pieces are well developed for the most part, So now I'll castle. (Plus the rook will solidify my hold on the center.",
        "8... e5 9. Nf3 Bg4": "Classical mechanism. Easily prevented by h3(?!) but chose not to risk opening up my king",
        "10. Be2 O-O 11. Bxf6": "Things are pretty stale, I figure I'd better get some action going before one of us is bored to death. Plus, I weaken the power of the bishop on g4.",
        "11... Bxf6 12. Nd5": "I'm just making myself out to be the aggressor here, and make him risk his king's position; Also delaying pawn to d5 push.",
        "12... Nc6 13. Nxf6+": "Probably could have delayed this, but chose not to. It works out eventually",
        "13... Qxf6 14. Nd2": "I want him to take the bishop (keep the action going, and show that I don't have to be the aggressor for the entire game). The knight adds protection to e4 pawn.",
        "14... Bxe2 15. Qxe2 Nd4": "Saw this coming, but not worried",
        "16. Qd1 b5 17. Nb3": "I'm purposely taking the risk of losing the e4 pawn to allow me to activate a rook. I could have done c3, but I'm a gambler, and I like to have fun as I play this game",
        "17... Nxb3 18. axb3 Rfe8 19. Rb1": "Just in case he pushes d5",
        "19... b4": "Now I switch from being the aggressor to the strategist.",
        "20. c3 bxc3 21. bxc3 a5 22. Re1": "refortify the center just in case of a counter-strike.",
        "22... Reb8": "interesting decision; trying to step up as the aggressor, let's see where this leads...",
        "23. Re3 Rb7 24. Rd3": "We are trying to catch one another off guard by switching roles.",
        "24... Rd7 25. c4 Ra6 26. b4": "? (maybe not the best idea...)",
        "26... a4 27. b5 Ra5 28. Qc1 Qd8 29. b6 Rc5 30. b7": "I'm not really trying to get a 2nd queen, I'm just trying to create an open lane for the rook",
        "30... Qb8 31. Ra3": "...and get this 'problem' taken care of,,,",
        "31... Rxb7 32. Rxb7 Qxb7 33. Rxa4 h6": "possibly a wasted move? Unless he thought i would sacrifice my queen to back-rank him.",
        "34. Qc2 d5": "?:hmm...probably not wise to push this now...",
        "35. exd5": "!!The better choice as Black's king is still blocked in",
        "35... Qxd5": "! interesting. Wonder if considering a rook trade?",
        "36. Rb4": "Don't wanna lose a pawn in this tight game, but has bigger things in mind...",
        "36... Qd4": "?? The big mistake. Qd8 would prevent the next move and still save the queen!",
        "37. Rb8+": "A well played game by both parties. 1 big mistake for black cost him. It's a shame such a wonderful game came to such a tragic end..."
