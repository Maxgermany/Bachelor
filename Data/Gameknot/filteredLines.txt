primeiro erro importante: o valor da posição vai a + 2,04, pois o cavalo permite um xeque a descoberto. erro muito grave: esse movimento faz a posição chegar a +7,24 (14 nxc6+ be4, 15 nxd8 kxd8 16 ng5 bxg2 17 nxf7+ seguido de nxh8). mas eu não vi tudo aquilo: apenas percebi que o xeque a descoberto me daria uma torre. ok, é suficiente! (valor: +4,09) após h6: +7,45 após rxd2: +10,10 valor após rxe4: +11,21. as pretas abandonam. 
-------------------------------------
valor da posição após 8. e4: +0,20. com 10. h4 o valor fica em -0,11, enquanto com o lance sugerido 10. e5 seria +0,59. minha intenção era sustentar um cavalo em g5. 11. a captura bxg5 foi mal avaliada pelo shredder, e esse primeiro erro mais sério custou mais de 0,70 para as pretas (em vez de -0,17, o valor ficou em +0,57). 12. para o software, h4xg5 era superior, e qxn custou 0,45 para a posição das brancas (segue o equilíbrio: avaliação: +0,00). 16. ng5 é mal avaliado, e as pretas chegam à sua melhor nota: -0,31, mas 16. … b4 é mal jogado, e alternamos para +0,22. erro das pretas: com 19. … bxn a posição vai a +0,97. erro das pretas: com 19. … bxn a posição vai a +0,97. grave erro das pretas em 20. f6: pela primeira vez algum lado ostenta vantagem (muito!) acima de +1,00: o valor da posição vai a +5,60. erro: a vantagem cai para +2,71. esse lance de bispo permite o incômodo 24. … rh3. contudo, as pretas optam por um outro lance muito mais fraco, entregando a partida. após 24. … ba6, mate em 3, começando com be6. em 27 eu não percebi que a dama estava pregada pelo bispo, o que significa que qf7 é mate. agora temos mate em 4. as pretas abandonam: além da grande desvantagem material, temos mate em 3 e as torres pretas inativas. 
-------------------------------------
esse bispo poderia dificultar os meus planos, por isso optei por expulsá-lo com o meu próprio bispo. isso interrompeu por alguns lances o andamento mais normal do kia, e eu gostei de não ter sido tão mecânico, parando para avaliar e sendo capaz de me desviar um pouco do meu roteiro. no kia esse bispo às vezes fica preso, embora depois que os cavalos brancos fazem todas as manobras que devem fazer esse bispo se torna ativo. participando de ataques na ala do rei. eu troquei sem maiores remorsos... foi um lance seguro, recomendado pelo shredder. o shredder recomendo avançar o peão de c até o centro, ameaçando o peão de d5. contudo, não avalia mal essa opção, de modo que a minha iniciativa de expulsar rapidamente o cavalo não mereceu maiores críticas. agora o kia começa a voltar ao roteiro original... segue o kia... (lance considerado fraco) aí está!!!! meu aguardado avanço até e4 finalmente aconteceu! ok... a recomendação do shredder para as pretas é mesmo trocar. shredder preferia ng5, mas eu não sou tão criativo assim: me contentei em retomar o peão. o shredder avaliou mal esse lance, de modo que uma vantagem que poderia ser de quase +0,20 virou uma desvantagem de -0,10 rapidamente expulsando o bispo... shredder defendia outras ideias (c3), mas esse cavalo funcionou bem aí, dado que as pretas trocaram damas parece que esse peão está sem defesa e pode ser capturado, mas a verdade é que essa captura deixa as peças pretas expostas a sérios ataques. foi o primeiro erro grave cometido pelas pretas (a posição seria +0,19 se as pretas tivessem jogado 16. ... nd7, mas o lance realizado deixou esse valor em +2,52. a combinação agressiva era com o outro cavalo... a minha jogada permite o-o, jogada que deixaria a posição das pretas com alguma esperança. outro erro bem grave: +3,50 alvo errado! as pretas deveriam ter jogado bxb. é como se as pretas pensassem "eu perco uma torre mas ganho outra, por isso neutralizei o ataque" - se bem que, na verdade, as pretas não pensam: é apenas o shredder tentando simular os equívocos que, em tese, um jogador 1300 cometeria... melhor seria ng6+, mas esse contra-ataque da torre não mudou o fato de que a minha posição estava com superioridade nítida. último erro grave: o certo seria be4, mas para salvar um bispo as pretas entregaram a partida. as pretas não rocaram! não deixa de ser mais um exemplo dos perigos de um rei centralizado - ainda mais assim, numa posição tão aberta! 
-------------------------------------
essa costuma ser a resposta mais incômoda as pretas realizam uma série de lances passivos... essa jogada foi precipitada, já que o cavalo pode ser facilmente expulso desse posto - embora para tal as pretas tenham que estragar um pouco o seu fianchetto. eu estava consciente da possibilidade de ter que recuar o cavalo mais avançado para h3, e isso não me incomodava muito. aqui a minha ideia era preparar um avanço do cavalo para e5. essa ameaça me deixou um pouco confuso. meu impulso foi o de prosseguir com o meu ataque, ignorando a ameaça ao peão de b2. a ideia seria colocar um cavalo em e5, abrindo caminho para que a dama tentasse um ataque na coluna h. eu calculei tudo de modo muito superficial e acabei desistindo. a boa notícia é que eu controlei meus impulsos e decidi pensar antes em uma defesa, mas a má notícia é que a defesa que eu providenciei foi completamente tosca! (b3, perdendo a torre) bye bye torre. como prêmio de consolação, eu estava controlando uma importante diagonal. a ideia não é atacar a dama, mas apenas posicionar o bispo nesse posto: depois que a minha dama for deslocada para f6, o bispo ocupará sua retaguarda, ameaçando mate - mas essa é uma manobra muito lenta! pronto, apesar de lenta, a manobra foi permitida pelas pretas. mas é bem fácil evitar o mate, basta jogar d4, por exemplo. um erro grosseiro. eu discordo dos programadores: um jogador 1350 não cometeria num erro desses. gastei menos de 7'.

“best by test as said by bobby fischer “develops and attacks d5 center square while opening up lines for queen and bishop directly challenges white pawn by attacking center square d4 and opens lines for his queen and bishop offers pawn to control center black can decline but this is best develops kingside and attacks center square e5 and d4 “fischer defence “opens diagonal for c8 bishop but blocks diagonal for f8 bishop pawn also attacks e5 square therefore move must be good attacks center square d5 again and develops queenside  wrong according to the principles of chess that states that one should first develop knights before bishops develops bishop on dangerous diagonal a2-g8 and attacks weak f7 pawn develops and attacks center but white still has much more control of center because of the pawn he offered ing the opening moves i considered setting the trap 6.ne5 hoping he play 6...bxd1 followed by 7.bxf7+ ke7 8.nd5# winning. but if black does not play bxd1 and instead plays nxe5 i would be in serous trouble therefore i played d4 opening up an diagonal for my bishop  bad move he should have played be7 or nf6 in other words he should developed his kingside and not waste time like this regains pawn and white clearly dominates the center. it can already been seen that white wins because he dominates the center and all his piece of developed and active as well as no weakness in his camp while black s has no pieces developed on kingside ,has little control of centre and weak squares f6,h6,f7 will be costly latter ing the game at last develops kingside  trying to trick him into playing qd7. my move is not the best and i would have never played it against a higher rated player but here gave it a try. falls in my trap he should have played a6 either forcing me to exchange my bishop or to force my bishop to b3 with b5 winning the knight for a pawn ,black cannot move knight because then i would attack his queen wasting his own time he again should have develop his knight to f6 taking his knight and attacking his queen black only move taking bishop away from danger back to the diagonal a2-g8  develops and note he does not block his bishop with nf6.but nf6 is not wrong preparing to queenside castle and crush black on kingside only good move preparing to bring rooks into play wrong. he should have played rfb8 (increasing the pressure on b2 square) and prepare to attack my king with his bishop, rooks and queens trying to trick him again if 14...bxh6 i would play 15.qxh6 any move 16. ng5 and mate on h7 latter on if he plays stuborn black had no plan therefore he has no good move currently if he had early play rfb8 he would have had maybe enough counter play on the queenside increasing the pressure on the weak f7 pawn  worst move any other move is better ,all this move does is prepares me to mate him on g7 square i could now mate on g7 stubbornly prevents me from mating for now only  taking his only piece defending g7 away blocks the mate again stubbornly winning the exchange and attacking queen only move mate follows after 19...rxd7 20.qxe5 anymove 21.qg7# the reason black has lost is because of not developing as fast as he could and for not have a plan

difesa francese, variante winawer  !?  un sistema più strategico al posto della più usuale (e naturale) 4...c5, dove non si attacca subito il centro avversario ma si pianifica una manovra usuale della francese, cioè il cambio con ...aa6 del proprio alfiere campochiaro 'cattivo' con quello 'buono' del bianco, che riduce in maniera concreta le sue possibilità d'attacco.  il bianco sta attaccando, in tipico stile di questi sistemi della francese/winawer, il pg7. il nero adesso deve decidere se lasciare il pg7 al suo destino e cercare controgioco in altri modi, oppure se e come difendere tale pedone.  ! questo è quello che viene ormai unanimemente chiamato 'sistema petrosian'. questa mossa paradossale viola apparentemente almeno tre principi dell'apertura classicamente intesa:  1) non muovere due volte lo stesso pezzo, a meno che non sia strettamente necessario (e qui non lo è) 2) non retrocedere con un proprio pezzo  3) non rimanere indietro con lo sviluppo.  eppure questa ritirata 'ipermoderna' ha una sua logica che si pò esprimere in questi punti: a) il vantaggio di sviluppo del bianco è negato dal fatto che la posizione del nero è priva di punti deboli e completamente chiusa  b) il vantaggio di spazio del bianco è negato dal fatto che il nero (e non il bianco) controlla il 'dove e quando' delle rotture pedonali, potendo scegliere il timing di ...c7-c5, ...f7-f6 o ...f7-f5, mentre le due spinte naturali del bianco (c2-c4 e f2-f4-f5) sono molto più complicate da organizzare.   questo porta a dire che questa continuazione contro-intuitiva ha una sua logica, è giocabile ed è più forte delle varie alternative alternative variation: 5...g6 [?!] 6.nf3 h5 7.qh3 ba6 8.bxa6 nxa6 9.o-o bxc3 10.bxc3 c5 11.bg5 [computer "rebel" - jussupow, a, ischia (ita) 1997]  alternative variation: 5...kf8 [relativamente migliore] 6.nh3 ( 6.bd2 [! /\ 0-0-0] ) c5 7.a3 bxc3+ 8.bxc3 qc7 9.bd2 ba6 10.bd3 bxd3 11.cxd3 c4 [?!] ( 11...nc6 [!?] ) 12.nf4 qc6 13.o-o $16 [faibisovich, v. - taimanov, m., 1973 ussr]  alternative variation: 5...ne7 [?

apertura del peon rey, libera el juego del alfil blanco del blanco en la diagonal f1 a a6. libera el juego de la dama que pasa a dominar la diagonal d1 a h5. ademas al avanzar el peon ocupa el centro.   el jugador de piezas negras se opone al avance del peon contrario y libera las diagonales del alfil y dama del mismo modo que el jugador de piezas blancas.   jugada de desarrollo que amenaza comer el peon central  desarrolla el caballo y defiende el peon central  desarrolla el alfil y domina con su alfil blanco la diagonal que va de a2 a g8. en realidad no, no es asi, porque esta obstruida la diagonal por el peon de f7.  el alfil de casillas negras amenaza el punto f2 y domina la diagonal y se desarrolla.  este es el famoso gambio evans. pierde un peon y gana un tiempo.   aca se produce la primer ganacia de tiempo, porque el peon del blanco se desarrolla y el alfil se ve obligado a repetir movidas con la misma pieza. se ve obligado a mover dos veces la misma pieza, eso es la pérdida de un tiempo que gano el peon. de modo que no puedo decir que gane un tiempo si no obligo a perder un tiempo al otro. ganar un tiempo es obligar a perder un tiempo al otro. si yo uso un tiempo y el otro usa tambien un tiempo, queda parejo en tiempos. si yo uso un tiempo mientras el otro pierde un tiempo, si gano un tiempo. ese es el tema de los tiempos.   el blanco gano dos tiempos porque si uno observa el tablero tiene dos peones más desarrollados que el negro y ocupa el centro del tablero . la ganancia de los tiempos se produjo cuando el blanco avanzo sus peones amenazando al alfil. entonces mientras el blanco desarrolla el negro se ve obligado a mover varias veces la misma pieza.  el alfil hace presión sobre la diagonal de a3 a f8, pero aprovecha que clava el caballo. en realidad el jugador de las negras puede cortar la diagonal avanzando su peon pero el blanco puede avanzar su peon a e5 y de ese modo sigue presionando sobre el peon que corta obstruye la diagonal.  este  este sacrificio del caballo es el inicio de una combinación . el caballo se sacrifica porque despues recupera la pieza al cambiar el alfil por el caballo negro y poder tomar el alfil negro. de modo que se recupera la pieza y deja al enroque negro mal posicionado. es por eso que sacrifica el caballo. el secreto de la combinación es que el alfil negro de casillas blancas queda sin defensa. esa combinacion no podia haberse hecho si no estaba el alfil de a3 presionando.

a bit late to be annotating this one but hopefully the process will still be helpful... the real business starts at move 7 in this project.  jo is a long-time adversary, who has a big plus score against me, so i'm glad i took my opportunities here...   this seems to be the most popular and effective move here, though her majesty does get stuck awhile. this too is the most popular move.  the knight really clogs up black's position. i think i tried ...kd6 in another game and got short shrift for my trouble.  this seems much better. there is a good case for preceding this with 11. a4.  11. d3 is also popular. black creates a hole for his k.  the computer prefers 11....a5, leaving the king and knight to argue over a6 and taking control over b4. so white aims to cover it with 13. be3+ black hastens to develop what he can and cover c5. each has 3 pieces defending c5 but black can't sustain this indefinitely.  the computer prefers 14...ka7, making no pretence to defend c5 or develop the r. ?  the computer sees an altogether more devious plan, whereby the b4 pawn creates havoc in black's defences and the knights grab more material on f8: 15. bxc5+ ka7 16. c6+ kb8 17. cxd7 qxd7 18. nc4 exd3 19. ne5 qd5 20. nxf8 rcxf8 21. nd7+ kc7 22. nxf8 rxf8 this appears to make white's king safer and brings a rook into the action but it also creates opportunities for black to counter-attack.  the computer prefers the more thematic 16. nxc5. black immediately launches a pawn towards the castled king, forcing white to decide how to redeploy her bishop.  the computer prefers the more consistent 16...b6, defending the c-pawn. on here, the b is bereft of decent squares but continues to support the knight on e6.  17. bf5 or 17. be2 were both interesting alternatives. black's developmental choices are distinctly restricted, so this move is not as odd as it may look.  the computer prefers black to clear off the central pawns first, rather than leave the e-pawn hanging. white cashes in on the pawn.  jo is never shy in accepting largesse and usually likes to equalise materially in these games as soon as she can.  at this stage, black is still 2 points up. now it looks like black plans to return those points by giving up the exchange. white reinforces the knight and threatens the rh6 at the same time. i'd originally planned to put the nd7 there, so this is a bit of a compromise. now white grabs another pawn and opens up another file.  with the b on h3, though, it will be a while before white can also exploit the f1-a6 diagonal. black's turn to attempt to open a file and free up his b. the computer has white's advantage gradually increasing  here.  now black has awkward choices.  i decided to concede the exchange for a pawn to get rid of one of the pesky knights. ? the computer prefers 22...gxf5. or bishops ...  the computer identifies this as a mistake because white doesn't gain as big an advantage as she would have done with 22. nxc5: best: -4.38 » 22. nxc5 nxc5 23. bxc5+ ka8 24. fxg6 b6 25. rxf6 exf6 26. bxf8 qxf8 27. nb3 qg7 28. bf5 kb7 29. nd4 h4 now white is 3 points to the good. at this point i commented that one of freddy's "rules" for this project is that forks are a waste of time; but i thought his comment was aimed more at white than black and that this looked like black's best move in this position anyway. white sticks to principles and leaves black with the choice, threatening check on b7 whichever knight black takes.  however, her better opportunity was to bully black's misplaced r with 24. e5! when the r would either have had to retreat, wasting time and giving white's pawns a chance to dominate or give itself up for a pawn. black doesn't have to hurry to take a knight.  this move offers a better way of deploying the bishop, now that the knight is gone from e6. the knight returns to e6 but the beast has been freed... now black must decide whether to equalise materially or do something else... money has it ... not sure what this was intended to achieve but it leaves black some nice squares.  the compute prefers backtracking with 26. rd1. at last the queen can enter the fray to purpose, forking e4 and c2 while also supporting a possible ...bc5+ white's plan to double rooks is too slow.  black is now winning.  again the computer prefers rd1. ? according to the computer this is a mistake but, i think, a natural one for a human - finally a chance to activate that bishop!  it also induces a fatal error by white.: mistake: +1.78 » … bc5+ 28. kh1 bb4 29. ng5 rd6 30. rg1 gxf5 31. bxf5 bc3 32. nf3 qc4 33. ra3 bb2 34. rd3 rxd3 35. cxd3 qxd3 36. re1 best: +3.34 » … qxe4 28. nxf8 rxf8 29. fxg6 qxg6 30. rab2 qc6 31. rb7+ ka8 32. bd7 qc5+ 33. kh1 e4 34. be6 e3 35. rd7 e2 36. bf7 qc6 ?? this blunders a piece away that white can ill afford. ?? the computer announces mate in 5 for black now. i'd worked out the mate in 5 for myself now. white agreed and waved the white flag, spelling out how mate was forced. 
-------------------------------------
here is the computer analysis : http://gameknot.com/img/i/computer.png i had a look at freddy's games and i feared his pawn's structures. i thought that, playing so would limitate the risks and i prefer open games. i'll try to defend the d pawn as long as possible to limitate white's pawn developement (see above). the d pawn won't live long and the bishop stays on a good diagonal. blocking the queenside. the fight has to be on the center first, aiming toward e7 and f7 after (or, at least, this is my plan). the d5 pawn was doomed, anyway, i just wanted to defend it as long as possible. now white has taken one move advance in developpement but the black's knight is dangerously placed and has to be watched carefully. i co not want a pin on the f knight. enabling the lsb to come on b7 or a8, if suited. taking control of the half open file. to enable a further rd8, take the control of c5 and support a future pawn there if black plans to contest the d pawn. to force 13. ... f6 (weakening the king, pinning the d5 knight and preventit it to move on f6 so that it has only one escaping square available (b4). drawback : my bishop will have to move twice but i estimate it is still valuable. i had expected 13 f6. this has the advantage not to weaken the king but white's dsb controls the d8 square which is good for white 14.c3 was another candidate move but this one prevents 14. ... h6 bishop on the long diagonal lsb unprotected but unattaquable during at least 2 moves unexpected move : logical to support a further c5 but letting the queen uncovered and the knight pined if dxc5. i hope it's an inaccuracy. to menace the queen (and, indirectly, prevent 16. c5) - white's developpement is completed : center strongly supported - good possibilities to attack black's kinside. weaker on the queenside ("on ne peut pas tout avoir !" the french says...) !? i have the impression that it's a mistake. one of us overlooks something (and i'm afraid it's me) : white will have a better center and black a pawn superiority on the queenside obvious move to get the best of white superiority on the d file (black cannot double the queen with a rook because of white's dsb). blocking the c5 pawn and menacing the black knight which cannot retreat (at the price of abandoning the lsb to his doom but one cannot have everything) queen safe and menace on b3 but all of black army is on his right wing. the center is protected by minor pièces and white has strong attacking possibilities. it may probably imply a sac. another candidate move was 19. ba2 but this one is more dynamic, aggressive and conform to white's overall plan (furthermore, i still fear freddy's capacities with pawns, so that their elimination seems safe). black had  little other choice. white carries on his plan : bring at least one rook on line 7 until now everything has been conformed to my plan ! unexpected but i had overlooked one move : 21. ... bd5 blocks the center and black will be able to take the and b pawns in a few moves (which was probably his plan) black has to pay attention, as white's attack is dangerous. i can see some mating sequences, even if black plays 21. bd5. at least, i'll give freddy to think (or at the very least, i hope so...). black seems to think as well that white's attack is dangerous and uses a drastic way to block it : mating menace and forced queen's trade. only move. black will block the center and i could afford to sacrifice one of the rooks to have rook and queen passed but not if i only have one rook left. i was expecting bd5 but this gives black a passed pawn and one isolated pawn so. at this point : no immediate threat, material is equal, the black king is unsafe, the center is contested and strongly attacked by both sides, black has the 2 bishops, white has a possible attack with the knight toward the rooks and will probably take control of the open file. the situation is slightly in black's favour but not much. after 22 moves, against a master, it's not so bad. freeing the e file and menacing a treble fork attack by 24. nb6. or a chess by 24. nf6+ of course, the b pawn hangs but i hope that white will get sufficient compensation for it. i was expecting 23. h6, obliging my dsb to leave. white is now one pawn late and black has 2 joined passed pawn but i estimate that white will have sufficient attack to get quickly an advantage to compensate (treble fork by nb6 or chess by knight f6+) with possibility  to bring one rook on the 7 line and 2 rooks on the open e file).  mistake, the gk computer suggests 24. rb1.  black seems to think that the advantage of the 2 passed pawns compensate the late in material if white takes one of the rooks. after carefull analyse, i think that 25. nxa8 or 25. nxc8 is a bit risky and i prefer to neutralise at least one of the passed pawns to try to obtain a draw (it will be hard because i have to be accurate. the situation is not complicated and it's useless to expect a mistake from black). completing the trade maybe a mistake but i found nothing else to do. i overlooked this move.   if 28. bxb2 rxe+ if 28. rxe8+rxe8 and white is in serious trouble (but maybe less than in the line we followed : the white rook is on a closed file.) i couldn't find any other option is it still a possibility to draw ? i'm not sure. furthermore, i'm not good at pawn and rooks endgames  i hesitated to pay 30. rb5 but white will probably have to bring the 2 rooks on the first line and this move enables it. a classical attack with pawn on the second line and opposite king on the first one. only move. the white king has to quit the first line. i thought black would have plaid 32. ... rxa4 to have a second passed pawn, supporting the first one. only move to save the f pawn. the black king probably expects to travel up to a4 most urging : white king off the first file. blocking the black king. black offers a trade. i estimate that the trade can wait and that my king had to come as near as possible from the a and b pawns.  no much choice (attacking the king is of no use, since he is aiming at b3 or c3) to make it a bit more difficult for black. white is almost in zugzwang, there are little moves left. the rook doesn't need to stay on b1 another option for black would have be to send his king on a2 almost forced now, the question is : how many moves will black need to give the mate ? (i decide that i'll go anyway until the very end). i'm surprised. i was expecting 43. ... kb3 44. rd3+  ka2 45. rd2 ka1 and white cannot prevent black to play 44. ... b1 except by loosing his rook. the rook has to move, else it is lost in 2 moves and the king cannot come on e4 without being in chess the next move. the promotion of the b pawn is unavoidable. thanks for the game, freddy.

defensa siciliana. otras posibilidades aquí para las negras son 2 ... d6, o 2 ... e6. pero 2 ... cc6 es también jugable. me sorprendió esta jugada. mejores acá son 4 ... e5 o 4 ... cf6 disputando el control del centro. 4 ... g7 se juega a veces también para sacar el alfil por g7 dominando la gran diagonal. con la jugada de la partida (4 ... cxd4) parece que el dominio del centro es de las blancas. evitando d5 (también podía haber jugado 6 cc3 con el mismo objetivo). ahora el peón de d7 queda retrasado en una columna semiabierta. esto significa que puedo atacarlo por la columna y no tiene otro peón que lo defienda, se puede volver débil. me gustó esta jugada. le da salida al alfil por b7 (salida que no iba a tener nunca por la diagonal c8-h3) y también pretende desarrollar el otro (ac5) ganando un tiempo sobre la dama. sobredefensa del peón e4 ante una eventual salida del alfil negro por b7. 7 ... f6?? es definitivamente mala... debilita el único flanco en el que el rey negro podía asegurarse enrocando. la idea del movimiento es poder desarrollar el alfil negro sin permitir a las blancas dxg7, pero el remedio parece ser peor que la enfermedad. error de nuevo. ahora sí, jugar d5 es imposible y ese peón (d7) va a ser una debilidad permanente. las negras debieron seguir desarrollando, ce7 parece mejor. el caballo se dirige a b3 desde donde amenaza quitar el par de alfiles a las negras. para luego poder enrocar más tarde las negras precisan primero sacar a la dama blanca de esa diagonal. de7 era la mejor opción porque, de paso, ofrece cambio de damas, lo cual sirve si se tiene menos control del centro y desarrollo, como es el caso de las negras. el par de alfiles ya está perdido, las negras intentan aunque sea colocar el caballo en una posición fuerte como d4. se amenaza transformar la ventaja. se pretende dar el par de alfiles a cambio de deteriorar la estructura de peones blancos. si las negras permiten axe4, luego de exd4 quedan con 2 peones doblados y aislados, uno de ellos imposible de defender (d4). se amenaza el peón de b6 (atacándolo con peón y alfil). si 16 ... b5 obviamente 17 axb5 y si 16 ... bxc5 17 axc5 y el rey negro no puede enrocar y queda muy expuesto. acá se empieza a ver la ventaja del par de alfiles a medida que la posición se va abriendo (debido al cambio de peones). el negro encuentra la solución atacando al alfil de d3 para luego jugar b5 (una vez que el alfil abandone la diagonal f1-a6). si no la abandona sigue cc2 atacando a la torre y al alfil, se mueve la torre y luego de cxe3 fxe3, se pierde el par de alfiles y se debilita la estructura de peones blanca. otra posibilidad era tfd1 defendiendo el alfil blanco, con idea además de ejercer presión sobre d7, pero opté por mantener el par de alfiles. era necesario expulsar a ese caballo molesto. impide enroque. se amenaza ganar el peón de b4. se "defiende" al peón, clavando a una de las piezas que lo ataca. indispensable. había que cambiar torres para no permitir tha8 y las negras dominaban la única columna abierta (a). aquí fritz 11 recomienda f4, y no tengo dudas que es mejor, se valorizaba más el par de alfiles al seguir abriendo la posición. activa al rey, pieza fundamental en finales. no voy a aceptar el cambio de alfiles en b7, pero no tengo problema en cambiar en d5, luego de exd5 obtengo 2 peones peligrosos en c5 y d5. el flanco dama se bloqueó, el negro quedó débil en casillas blancas que ahora son la ruta ideal para mi rey. mi plan es jugar f4 y penetrar con el rey por f4-f5-g6. el movimiento prohibido. ahora tengo una secuencia ganadora. mi peón avanza hacia la coronación siempre "con tiempo" sobre el caballo. si ahora cd8 (única si no quiere entregar el caballo) sigue c7 atacando otra vez al caballo pero amenazando además coronar en c8. rd7 sería forzada y perdería el caballo (cxd8). luego c7 y el peón queda defendido, impidiendo además al rey negro despegársele. hay que tener cuidado con esta trampa. si 38 rxc4 sigue 38 ... b2  39 c7 b1 = d  40 c8 = d  dc1  ganando. mi alfil se dirige a c1 desde donde impide c2 y permite a mi rey tomar en c4. mate en 7 ahora. de aquí en adelante los movimientos de las negras son todos únicos, la partida se remata con un bonito mate de peón.

this was a tournament game against a player around 200 points higher. in the middle game white has a strong attack but black defends valiantly and makes a come back as you will see.  we start with the english opening this is where we depart from the gameknot database which prefers bg2n in preparation for castling. according to the computer analysis this is the first inaccuracy, it prefers … nc6 8. o-o re8 9. re1 h6 10. rb1 g5 11. h3 e5 12. d5 nb4 lining up against the black queen. i must admit this was a bit of a suprise, the computer calls it an inaccuracy and prefers … h6 13. bf4 qe7 14. h4 rd8 15. qe2 nc6 16. red1 nc5 the recapture adds to the pressure on f6 and i have the option of bringing my knight to e4 to add to that pressure, around this point i start to form a plan which ideally involves my knight on f6 and my queen on h somewhere analysis says that this is the first mistake of the game preferring 14. bf4 g5 15. bxg5 nxe5 16. qe4 na6 17. red1 f5 18. qh4 rf7 19. rd6 rd7 20. rxd7 qxd7 21. be7  this move however is consistent with my plan as well as adding support to the e5 pawn i managed to completely over look the forthcoming fork i think this is an attempt to free some space, black appears to be in a little bit of a bind i continue with my plan the computer calls this a blunder due to  … bxe5 19. bf6 nd7 20. bxe5 qd8 21. qh6 nxe5 22. ng5 re8 23. qxh7+ kf8 24. qh8+ ke7 25. qxe5 qd7 26. qg7 kd8 27. nxf7+ kc8 28. qxg6 axb4  i was in two minds whether to move bf6 or nf6, one of the reasons i chose this was that it seemed to me to be more forcing however the computer calls this a mistake due to  19. nf6+ bxf6 20. bxf6 nd7 21. bxc6 h5 22. qg5 kh7 23. qb5 axb4 24. bxd7 qb8 25. qxb4 qb7 26. bb5 qf3 27. bd4 rfb8 28. a4 g5  it prefers 19. bf6 nd7 20. bxe5 qd8 21. qh6 nxe5 22. ng5 re8 23. qxh7+ kf8 24. qh8+ ke7 25. qxe5 qd7 26. qg7 kd8 27. nxf7+ kc8 28. qxg6 axb4 i this point i thought i had a won game however black had different ideas the analysis says -  blunder: +8.97 » … h5 21. re5 qd7 22. bf3 qd8 23. bxd8 nd7 24. rxh5 gxh5 25. qg5+ kh7 26. qxh5+ kg7 27. be7 axb4 28. bxc6 nc5 29. bxa8 rxa8 30. bf6+ kxf6 best: +3.17 » … nd7 21. bxc6 nxf6 22. bxe8 nxe8 23. c5 bxc5 24. bxc5 nc7 25. kg2 rfb8 26. qa4 nd5 27. c6 rb4 28. qa3 rc8 29. rc1 this was a multi purpose move, firstly it prevented a black queen incursion on d1, it also threatens a bxh3 sacrifice to open the black king and last but not least it clears a little bolt hole for my king. at this point i was still fairly confident. slightly frustratingly for me the analysis shows this as a mate in 10 which of course i didn't forsee  blunder: +mate(10) » … qd3 23. rxh5 gxh5 24. bxh5 qb1+ 25. kg2 nd7 26. qg5+ qg6 27. bxg6 nxf6 28. be4+ kh8 29. qxf6+ kg8 30. qg5+ kh8 31. qh6+ kg8 32. qh7#  when i was trying to analyse the possibilities, i could see that the black queen could end up on g6 but i couldn't see how to get around that so i planned to try to get the black queen off the b1-h7 diagonal it's funny how one move can throw a position away and this is apparently it, instead of protecting the bishop i should probably have played bxh5 as then gxh5 looks fairly dangerous for black. although analysis calls this a blunder as the mate in 10 is still on. aimed at keeping the black queen off that diagonal the computer calls this a mistake but i think it was carefully calculated as after the oncoming sequence of exchanges, black was still ahead on material. i was a little frustrated with this move as i felt i should have been able to get a little more out of the position i was in. at this point the analysis has black quite far in front, i felt i had all but lost the game and decided i was going to take the opportunity to try to delay the inevitable as long as possible by harrassing black analysis calls this a mistake preferring … rc5 34. qb4 ra7 35. h4 rac7 36. kh3 kg7 simply grabbing material in the hope i can take advantage and chase the black king a little passed pawns must be pushed around this point analysis has the score more or less equal and i was starting to hope i may be able to get near to promotion as long as i was careful, i had half an eye on qf6 pinning the rook on c7 with a view to advancing my pawn or taking blacks e6 pawn this move suprised me as i can skewer the rook as we will see and black resigned as all i need to do now is exchange the rook and the queen then black will be unable to prevent promotion.  thanks for reading please comment.

le pion du roi sicilienne à l'attaque plutôt qu'au développement... ça va payer. pas très malin décidément pas brillant et pan! sur e6 et pan! double attaque! superbe combinaison décide que la reine vaut bien trois pièces finalement ce sera plus cher, mon cher j'aurais dû raisonnablement abandonner ici... mais j'ai eu envie de "tester" mon adversaire... oho! il allège la pression: il y avait sans doute bien mieux, comme te1 ahlala! pourquoi ne pas avancer les pions? ici, il a bien fait de ne pas faire te1... sinon cd2+ prend la reine. je vais essayer de combiner les chevaux... ceci est vraiment une erreur, qui me donne la nulle. et voilà... coup de chance.

  black now develops his knight while putting more pressure on d4. black now has a huge initiative. white pins blacks knight but it is a feeble attempt at counter-play as the threat is only short-term and easily defendable, (bd7).  better is nb3 which brings the knight away from the bishops firing line and defends the queen-side, preparing for a king-side counter-attack.  qb6? – this move may seem ideal as black defends his knight while putting even more pressure on d4. the queen also covers b2 and when the bishop moves, black will be putting direct pressure on that square which will cause trouble for white no matter what side white will castle. the queen and the bishop are not in a battery, they are working together very effectively. 
-------------------------------------
 probably best is 11)…. qxd4, qxd4, bxd4, nc7 , kd8, nxa8, bxb2, rb1, bc3 . 
-------------------------------------
  forced. (nb3, bxc3, qxc3, qxb5) or (f3, bxd4, fxg4, be3) taking with the b pawn opens up the b file and stops whites knight from moving to d5. white’s king now looks unsafe and even after nb3, white can eventually put his a-pawn into use.  white shuns the knight away from the g4 square and hopes that the influence of black’s fianchettoed bishop will be lowered if its path will be blocked by his own knight. however, it just encourages black to centralise the knight and aim for the c4 square. f4 could be considered to prevent black’s knight from moving to e5 and attempting some king-side counter play. 
-------------------------------------
 however, playable for white is 15) na4, qa6, qc3, qxa4, 17) qb3, qxb3, axb3 where black will emerge from the position only a pawn up. black should win with the bishop pair for white’s knight but it will definitely be a harder victory.

matus slo 34 - 5.0 in round #1.  i need these wins for round #2 because horsekis is moving up. accelerated dragon maroczy bind... later shown to be completely faulty.  yuck what a terrible position i get myself into.  i was lucky to win. can't remember why the rush to play 7.be3 because be2 looks better in hindsight.  must have been worried about that n on d4.  was it ...nxd4 .qxd4 nxe4 or ...qb6 or ...e5.  even 7.h3 or f3 work out better than the text.  maybe i thought i could capture qxg4 but that leaves my d4 n unprotected (…nxd4 9.qd1 nc6 and i have initiative plus saved by dsb).  hmmmm, might be better than the mess i got into.  so 7...ng4 is a good move.  at least after 10.o-o my r is on an open file. again, 11.nxc6 allows his fianchetto b too much range.  computer says black already has an advantage.  better 11.nf3 or nb3 to keep control of central squares.  after the text plays out to 13.rad1 i control 7 vs his 5 so 12.qc2 would have been better.  i need threats. 13.rad1 maybe this was a bad idea.  i have too many pawns hanging.  his 13…ba6 proves this because now my lsb is protecting a pawn. game note: "15.bxc3 now there's a pretty picture"... ending in the uglier 20.e5 lol game note "19…bb7 not too sure.  he really needs f6." game note: "21.rd7 would also be strong at some point but i’m finishing off my plan first."  computer says i blew it because he could have played …bc6.  luckily he didn’t so i jumped on it by move 22.rd7 and now i start to re-gain equality of some sort. game note: "25.h5 i control 5 in the centre vs his 3.  and 25...ba4 leaves me more control so i don't find that to be a good move.  especially if he's thinking ...bxc4.  his dark squares are weak." game note: "so 27.h6 with r lift to come soon.  he needs to open his f-file for his r.  but how do i land the final blow?" 28.exf6 post game analysis computer shows the immediate rd7 to be much better.  even gxf6 followed by rd7 is better.  anyway, i had the idea of moving my r up so i’m ok. game note: "30...rf8 i just learned i need 1 of 2 points from this 2 game match vs colorman in order to tie for first in this 2nd round.  sadly, i can't figure out a plan to get past the current position.  i thought advancing my r was the answer, but now what?" game note: "33…re8 he breaks the cat and mouse.  i'm not looking for 3 move repetition just can’t figure how to move forward." game note: "35.rxa7 so i’ll grab this for now." game note: "36…kf8 he goofed up." 38…rxc3 post game play through and i don’t see much value in my c3 pawn so he should have considered …rh3 …kg8. 40.rb8 looking after the game and computer prefers bf3 which i never would have considered but it’s brilliant with the potential for c4-f7 fork or 40…bxc4 41.rb8 and the h-pawn promotes due to his r being blocked out. 40…bxc4? he really needed …rh3 because my re-capture puts him in check. 43.ke1 i almost blew it.  needed to protect the h-file, but it’s a lost cause anyway i end up with the r advantage. game note: "46.rd8 cut off the board so he can’t get over to his q-side pawns." 49…g3 the computer thinks it sees a mate in 14 lmao.  let’s hope i can win before 14 more moves. game note: "52.kf1 surely he sees it's over." he resigns 1-0 and i secure at least a tie in this round of the tournament.  getting ready for round 3!!  if i can win the other game against him i take clear first place. 
-------------------------------------
i’ve been using this more often in the last year.  this is the slow, preparatory move that i previously used before 4.d4.  not bad but bc4 is still an option.  …nf6 would force nd2 or maybe bg5.  post-analysis…. computer much prefers bc4 but i’m more familiar with the text move.  7.o-o nxe4 8.re1 is playable but again, not much experience with it.  in the recent carlsen-caruana match there were comments to the effect that this type of move is not best.  not 100% sure why.  be3 best??  anyway, i have intentions to move the dsb around to g3.  9.d5 would interfere with his dsb but i wasn’t in the mood for such a closed game after having just played a few.  didn’t see that coming.  …h6, …o-o, …bg4 in my opinion.  post-analysis computer doesn’t like it.  takes away from the central control.  now i’m 5 vs his 6.  computer says this is best but i never even considered it’s second suggestion of 11.qe3 which i probably would have preferred.  computer considers this a mistake.  12.be3 best.  completes his plan but frees my position to my advantage.  i’m 5 vs 6 in the centre.  he has no intention of opening the centre.  my q is no use on c1 anymore.  wish i could tackle the hole on f5.  wow the computer prefers fxg3.  gotta think about that for a while.  the only benefit i see is mobility for the r.  over the course of the game it would not have mattered.  17.nh4 is a plan to get to f5, block his q from g4 and get my q in his k-side.  of course it’s a result of his text move which technically is a mistake. +1.09 (better is 16...exd4 or 16...d5)   could still try …exd4 maybe.  computer suggests awkward moves like …rh7 or …kf8.  i don’t have any notes on this but computer doesn’t list it as much of an option.  seems obvious enough aiming at f7.  21.f3 to open up the k-side but might fail to ...bxd4+ we'll see if he takes the trap.  nope so i focus on the weak c6 square with rc1.  he needs to improve on his k-side attack.  at move 21 the computer had a complicated plan to fake a pin on the q & k to bring the pawn out.  too deep for me, didn’t see it.  plus the computer must be thinking it’s a mistake to open the h-file for my opponent.  - / +  not 23.qxg4 bxd4+!   26.qd2 i'm stuck. might try d5.  his double r on the h-file would look gnarly.  dunno why he plays his next move.  27.qc3 back to the c6 square.  and holy cow the computer analyses 27…qxf5 as the best follow-up move.  attack the k!!  bd5 was needed.  32.nxd6+ screw it. discovered attack on the r looks pretty so i jumped at it before analyzing.  with 31…kb7 he must have wanted to relieve his n but missed that it put him into a fork.  darn check.  bye bye q’s.  keep the pressure.  keep my k from being pinned down.  45.rc3 pretty stale   46...c4 takes that square from his n so 47.rxg3 and i'm boss!  48.rg6 (...nc5 49.kd4/kd5 +/-) nf4 49.rh6 nxe6 50.rh6 and if nxg2 then 51.bh3+ attacking the n.  49.g4 nf4 (fork)  50.rg5+   52.kf3 (not kf5 which is ok to keep opposition on his k) maintains the scope of my r (53.rb5!) and pressures his n.  54...nd3 at this point acenlv took first place with a win over bcjuk but we could all tie at 4 points if i win this.   
-------------------------------------
hi, again. my third annotation. every game commented began with 1 e4 e5 and i played with black. i'll annotate a game with white. i helped in the annotations with stockfish, that refutes, corrects and affirms some of the ideas. consequently, i will comment on my own ideas and what the engine tells me the most common reply to 1 e4 e5.  i played, as usual, 2 ... nc6 and i invites to my opponent to play a spanish opening.  my rival chose the italian opening or giucco piano.   i play, as usual, the two knights defence. now, white can play a sharp game with 4 d4 or 4 o-o or move twice the knight with 4 ng5, where white, in the main variation, is a pawn up and black is ahead in development. however, my rival enters in a quiet variation. black, in my knowledge, can play too 4 ... d5, 4 ... d6 and 4 ... be7. the two last variation are similar, the first leads to a definite center. i chose an active line i expected 5 c3 and white enter in the giucco pianissimo variation. if i played with white, i delayed the castle and active the pieces (may be 5 bg5 in the canal variation), watching the black reaction. nevertheless, in my opinion, castle is ok for white. black can play the freedom move 5 ... d5 but after 6 exd5 nxd5 7 re1 white puts pressure in e5 and black justifies the early castle of the white. now, blacks threats the pin 6 ... bg4. but this move looks like a blunder. now, black has an attack option with the push g5-g4 and open columns against the castle. white can play sure with 6 c3 (giucco pianissimo) or 6 nc3 (four knights opening). still not being decisive, it already indicates where to attack to the black. i wanted to play 7 ... g5 and prevents the bg5 pìn. i don't understand the move. 7 c3 looks better follow the plan. white given the d1-a4 diagonal to the queen and prepares d4 push in the center stockfish disagrees with this natural move and suggest short castle.  however, i think the attack on the kingside is quick and concise forced move. natural defence of the f3-knight.  taking the column. stockfish gives a slighty advantage to white in this position in depth 20. my rival takes the space in the queenside. i calculates a central reaction with 11 d4 but this move fails, right now. if the black king will remains in the center, thus d4 is a good move. unpinning the queen with tempo?? no neccesary, i can develop the queen, prepare the queenside castle and defends f7. qd7 or qe7? that's the question.  i chose qd7, seing h3-g4 complex of squares and give e7 square to knight if white plays b5 in any time. moving the king of the open column and avoids bh3 threat. i expected 14 a4 a5 15 b5 nb8 (ne7 16 bxf7+) 16 ba3 with idea of rad1, where white search for counter strike in the center. but this variation fails by means of 16 bh3!.   stockfish suggests 13 nh4!  a mistake. i forget my f7 pawn! nevertheless, black has at this point, good compensation in the line 15 bxf7 rg7 16 bc4  my opponent play the right move if you see the stockfish evaluation, but i thinked a poor move. my feeling while i thinking the position was "i have a winner attack in this position, i need find it". thus, i wanted to add pieces to the attack. however, 14 ... be2 was better, according with stockfish. at this point, stockfish says slighty advantage for black if  15 bxf7 rg7 16 bxh5 and about a pawn up for the move in the game. again, my feelings was i must winning for attack i wanted double the rooks in the column. incidentally, i defended the f7-pawn. a good move, according to stockfish. when i see the move, i suppose that white want play now rg1, supporting g2 with the price of a quality (bxf2 and bxg1), where exchange a inactive piece (ra1) for an attacking piece (bb6). however, i expected the move 16 d4 exd4 17 a4 dxc3 18  a5 searching for counterattack.  stockfish suggest, also, 16 qd1. doubles the rooks in the column and threating bxf3, where the queen enters in the kingside. this move is a blunder, now the black attacks is in a roll if 18 bxb6 rxg2+ 19 nxg2 rxg2+ 20 kh1 qh3++. else if 18 nxf3 rxg2+.  the only move. the best choice, according to the engine. i calculate  18 ... nxg3 (winning too according stockfish) but i prefers take no risks.  a strong move!! really, stockfish gives 19 ... bf4 but i didn't see that! i played safe now, i was calculating nf4 with threat of qh3++ but 21 ne6 stops the attack. again, i played safe too late, my rival wants a queenside attack. i played, right now, 21 ... nf4 but stockfish gives 21 ... qg4 than better. similarly, my opponent resigns threating 22 ... qh3+. if white plays 22 gxf4 rg2+ 23 kh1 qh3++. the only move was 22 be6 but nxe6 and nf4 (again) is winning.  i hope i have explained the annotations well. and i also hope you enjoyed the game. comments and questions are welcome. corrections are most welcome, even. and if they refute my analyzes, they will help me a lot 
-------------------------------------
9.qe2, 9.b3 or 9.c4 are all commonly played. black tries to exchange white’s key bishop. but of course white prefers to keep it on the board. 15…rxb2? would be a blunder, because of the discovery 16.bxh7+. this is an inaccuracy and gives white a lot of play.  black could’ve aimed for a draw with 16…bxh4 17.nxh4 qxh4 18.bg5 qg4 (18…qc4 19.re3) 19.bd1 qf5 20.bc2 qg4 21.bd. if white plays on, he is down a pawn and black is a little better. and black’s queen cannot escape via c4 either, because of 22.be2. but given the huge rating difference it is understandable that black is looking for more than a draw. black’s idea was that if 18.nxd4 bb4 or 18.qxd4 bc5. a very risky move. 18…bxg5 19.nxg5 nf8 lead to a safer position for black. better was 20.rxe6 bc4 (20…fxg5 21.rxa6 nc5 22.rxa5 d3 23.ba4 white is up 2 pawns with a solid advantage.) 21.re4 fxg5 22.rxd4 bb4 (22…bb5 23.a4 bc6 24.qd3; 22…be6 23.re1 bc5 24.rxe6) 23.bxh7+! kh8 (23…kxh7? 24.rxd7+) 24.qc2 be6 25.hxg5 with a winning position. black has a nice center, but due to the lack of a g-pawn black’s king is in danger. a natural and strong attacking move. black’s best choice was 21…bf8 22.bb3+ kh8 23.rg4 rxb3 24.axb3 f5 25.rg3 f4 26.bxf4 exf4 27.qxf4 bg7 28.ng5 qf6 29.nf7+ kg8 30.qxf6 nxf6 31.nd6 and white is better, but black has some hope to survive. another good option was 22.bg7+ kxg7 23.rg4+ kf7 24.qh6 with a killer attack. relatively best was 22…bb4 23.bg7+ kxg7 24.rg4+ kh8 25.qh6 re7 26.nc6 qf8 27.qxf8+ rxf8 28.rxb4 axb4 29.nxe7 but white has a winning endgame advantage. ! bang! white finds a second nice sacrifice, which wins the game. if 25…kh8 26.qh6. black cannot stop the mate. if he goes 26…bc5, then 27.rg8+ ke7 28.rg7+ kf8 29.qf7 checkmate. 
-------------------------------------
se trata de la segunda ronda. mi rival es un competidor de ajedrez avanzado, rico en teoría, experto en partidas de larga duración. planteo un gambito de dama desarrollando pieza, preparando enroque corto, y quizás seguir con g6, y luego ag7. defensa india. me parece mejor, 6....cxc3, seguido de una presión por da5, y c5, y el alfil en g7 y por supuesto, dxc un error o por lo menos es la pérdida de un tiempo, me parece mejor 6...cxc3 o cd6 una jugada bastante extraña que especula con cb4, me parece mejor cd7 o ag4 una jugada muy difícil de ver que sin embargo me parece la mejor, fritz también la recomienda  para esconder el alfil en g2, especular con g4 y la pérdida eventual del caballo. una popular maniobra de aronian hace un año. el error, deja debilitado el enroque, sin protección al alfil en e6, aislado al caballo de a6 y atrapa al caballo de h5, era mejor seguir desarrollando, por ejemplo a db6 sacrificio para destruir el débil enroque del negro la premeditada g4. prolongando lo más posible la presión del caballo en h5, de todas maneras está condenado y mantener la presión busca dos objetivos, una, quebrar al rival provocando su segundo craso error y dos que pierda tiempos valiosos intentando salvar a un caballo que está condenado otra jugada muy difícil de ver, la mejor por parte de las negras por obvias razones, se le da continuidad a la jugada ca6, para presionar con c5 y se amenaza abrir la columna a, en caso de enroque largo un error táctico si bien no garrafal, pero sí notorio que le da contrajuego a las negras y posibilidad de tablas por jaque perpetuo, me percaté de eso ya que lo había hecho. era mejor enroque corto. buena jugada, esta vez el negro contraataca. aunque me parece más efectiva y más letal dxc, con b5 el negro aspira a tablas por jaque perpetuo era mejor jugar tg1  un error, es mejor pasar directamente a b4 con fuertes posibilidades de tablas la mejor es rb1, h6 es un error afortunadamente para mí, el negro opta por cd3+ en lugar de ca2+, la cual es mucho mejor y en caso de que la hubiese hecho, hubiese posibilidad de tablas y las negras rinden ante las amenazas de mate inevitables 
-------------------------------------
apertura abierta defensa francesa lo ideal es mover d4 rompimiento clásico, atacando el poderoso peón de e4 se puede hacer el cambio, y se espera un juego semiabierto donde las casillas centrales son controladas a distancia, generalmente por alfiles. en el peor de los casos, puede terminar en tablas según las probabilidades de los programas informáticos en un 50% se elimina al poderoso peón de e4, pero permanece el peón de d4 preparando el enroque desarrollo normal de piezas, generalmente se juega ad3 para preparar el enroque lo antes posible de inmediato se ataca esta debilidad clavando el caballo y amenazando ce4, y preparando el enroque corto demasiado pasiva, era mejor ad3 de nueva cuenta, es demasiado pasiva errores que debí aprovechar mejor me parece bastante precipitada esta jugada, pienso que era mejor af5 o cc6  aqui pienso que lo mejor es enroque corto mala jugada, demasiado precipitada que sólo busca "blofear", especular sobre supuesta ganancia territorial de casillas y desorden de piezas, generalmente es efectiva pero en partidas blitz. un jugador experimentado en tácticas como mi rival, no iba a caer tan fácil. es mejor tomar en c5 y jugar posicionalmente excelente jugada, me sorprendió demasiado, fue entonces que caí en la cuenta de que no debo jugar con tácticas tan simplonas con un jugador tan experimentado como sergio clemente, jugador experto en tácticas lo que temía, no hay opción que el cambio y todo mi supuesto ataque se vuelven cambios forzados, encaminados a unas tablas unica esto fue lo que debi haber hecho en vez de c5 me parece que el blanco tuvo la oportunidad de tomar el control de la partida pero se perdió en jugadas profilácticas como esta que le generará casillas débiles en b3 una idea bastante común, se frena el supuesto avance de b4, y se deja al blanco con la casilla débil en b3 a la 12ava jugada, el blanco se enroca. no es malo en algunos casos, pero creo que pospuso demasiado el enroque por lo que perdió muchos tiempos y la oportunidad de continuar con el control de casillas centrales no termina de agradarme, porque se deja en el aire a un alfil pero por otro lado se aprovechan las líneas centrales abiertas para fastidiar al blanco con el avance de d4 una buena jugada, bastante sana, permite entrar al juego a la dama. especula con su salida en d2 y conectar las torres, además de que amenaza tomar peón de d4. pero se deja la jugada b4 pospuesta, por ende la casilla debil en b3 y el cb3 mal posicionado ante un a4 de las negras una jugada que no termina de gustarme, se expone un poco a la dama...pero se especula con el traslado de la misma al ala del rey blanco finalmente, ocurre. estoy en desventaja con dos peones pero con la posibilidad de quitar a la poderosa pareja táctica de caballos. no me gusta del todo un cambio de caballo por alfil, sobre todo cuando este domina casillas centrales cambio de damas, para simplificar el juego, cosa que me convenía ante este jugador fuertemente táctico sólo falta una pieza negra para activación forzado, pero se amenaza captura en c2 mala jugada porque cambia un alfil bastante bueno, y deja debilidad en d3 de inmediato se ataca a la debilidad calculado todo, sólo se prosiguió con una sutil amenaza para desviar el control de casillas centrales es hora de atacar esa debilidad estaba bastante interesado en cambiar su única pieza que controlaba casillas centrales sutilmente se amenaza capturar peón, inevitablemente, recuperando el peón perdido que debi capturar desde hace 10 jugadas tc2, y se van acabando las esperanzas del blanco sutil mejor era tc1 con la posibilidad de captura y ganancia de un peón admito que esta jugada no la había calculado, y en todas las variantes que seguían el blanco adquiría una ventaja si bien, no aplastante, pero sí una ligera ventaja me costó mucho ver esta jugada que a simple vista parece una mala jugada, lo cierto es que se especula ya con activar la torre desusa y sacar el rey negro a pasear o esconderlo bien en g7. aunque después de varios minutos de calculo, vi que salvaba al rey negro para colocarlo en e7 y especular con llevarlo al ala dama del blanco y capturar peón de a3. asi mismo especulo con tomar en b6 o b7, y por rayos x en b2 era de esperarse finalmente se activa y ahora tengo 3 amenazas de captura admito que esta la había calculado poco porque fue demasiado complejo saber si hay una ventaja o una desventaja, lo cierto es que el resultado era el mismo que si estuviese en b6, como lo había pensado en un principio forzada, protege b7 se acabaron las amenazas para el rey negro, el cual ha evitado los mates espantosos en octava fila y captura un peón blanco forzada también, pero ahora sí, finalmente se captura el peón después de una serie de maniobras que parecían malabarismos bonita jugada táctica, el caballo blanco especula con la captura de el caballo negro por su torre, y si td4, sigue cc6+, seguido de ca5 ganando torre por caballo, pero el negro también tiene sus propias jugadas tácticas. igual, una tactica bastante bonita, y se forza el cambio de torre de b1 amenazando mate en b1 y sacrificando caballo negro...pero el blanco tiene una última carta bajo la manga esta otra jugada tampoco la calculé...muy bonita jugada, pero después de dejar la sorpresa decidí calcular más y en efecto no había más que igualdad, el blanco rescata una posición perdida y gana igualdad otra táctica sutil pero equivocada, ahora pienso que no pasaría realmente nada con las negras, hasta sería mas sano para las blancas cambiar el caballo y adquirir una ventaja leve, luego de 35. cxb3, 36.-ab, y tb1 o más útil, 36.- ....rf1!, con posibilidades de tablas pero el detalle del ajedrez es no desconcentrarse o desmoralizarse por jugadas que pareciesen buenas, y no lo son. si el blanco hubiese tomado hubiesen sido tablas o peor, ventaja de las blancas por suerte mi rival se desconcentró y se equivocó gravemente pues deja la casilla d1 libre y la oportunidad de seguir las riendas del juego por las negras, además de posibilidad de una pequeña táctica ese último error, es aprovechado inmediatamente, se especula con cc3 para seguir presionando. tercer error, debía ser cuidadoso y calcular las siguientes jugadas de manera tal que mi rival no supiese en la trampa táctica en la que caerá. era mejor cg3, a pesar de 37...td1+, 38.- cf1, en caso de 38...cd2, simplemente txd2.  desde ese momento las blancas han perdido el caballo (hago una nueva corrección, luego de te2+, seguido de te3...muy difícil de ver pero se logra la igualdad) otro error, el cual consistió en dejarse llevar por la rápidez de los movimientos cuando debió jugarlos concienzudamente.  muy bonita jugada no sirve cd5+, por la amenaza rd6 simple pero sútil si 39....txd3, 40.- ce2+, seguido de cxd3 quedando con pieza de más y amenazando coronación del peón en fila a último craso error y las blancas abandonan, pero ya lo habían hecho moralmente desde varias jugadas atrás. agradezco a sergio, por el juego

my dear friend elena has asked me to annotate this game for her. so i do so! black decides on the sicilian defence! white opts for a closed version of it. i think this move rather lacks bite.  black develops sensibly as does white this is quite sound too sound development, but again rather lacking bite. what is white's plan exactly here? after white's rather unambitious opening, i would have been tempted to try d7-d5 instead here. white continues to develop. as does black. sensible development again! this rather wastes a move. if black wanted to play this, she could have played d7-d5 in one move rather than two. still it threatens d5-d4, so white has to do something about this threat. so white takes. black takes back. this again is very passive. bg5 was far more active. maybe d3-d4 could have been played too. this leaves black with a comfortable space advantage. so black develops white castles as does black another sensible move, moving the rook to the open file. is she preparing b7-b5 taking space on the queen side? i fins this slightly odd too. white is planning c3 and d3-d4 after all. but the point is, she could have played d3-d4 earlier, under more favourable circumstances. moves the queen forward. white carries on with the plan. but black prevents the plan from being carried out. this is a fine move by the italian player! white takes. black correctly takes back with the knight. taking back with the pawn was possible and gives a slight edge to black, in terms of more space controlled. this is better though, it makes it a lot easier to attack the weak white pawn on d3, along the semi-open d file. this is a mistake, allowing black to get two bishops in an open position. nxd4 qxd4 15. bc3 qh4 16. nd2 nd5 17. be5 nf4 18. g3 nh3+ 19. kf1 qg5 20. f4 qg6 21. nc4 bf5 22. rc1 was better. so black takes the bishop white recaptures. black mobilises her rook. now that the bishop on e7 is protected by the rook, black is threatening the pawn on d3 with the queen. qxd3 immediately loses to rxe7! as does white, protecting d3 at the same time. this is a mistake. i can't see why black can't just win a pawn here with ng4. post match computer analysis (pmca) gives b5 17. qc2 bb7 18. h3 nd5 19. nxd5 bxd5 20. rae1 qd7 21. b3 bd6 22. ne5 qf5 23. bc3 as the best for both sides. pmca gives this as a blunder too. rxe8+ nxe8 18. ne4 qd5 19. qc2 bf5 20. re1 bb6 21. nxc5 bxc5 22. re5 bxf2+ 23. kxf2 qd7 24. re3 nf6 25. ne5 is given as better. black at last develops the bc8 and also protects the re8 which is doubly attacked. pmca gives this as a blunder and suggests 18. rxe8+ bxe8 19. qe5 qxd3 20. qxc5 bc6 21. qe3 qxe3 22. bxe3 bc7 23. nd4 bd7 24. bg5 ng4 25. h3 be5. i can't see why black can't just take on d3 now, however... this looks good too, putting the bishop on a fine diagonal. 19. rxe8+ bxe8 20. qe5 qxd3 21. qxc5 bc6 22. qe3 qxe3 23. bxe3 bc7 24. nd4 bd7 25. bg5 ng4 26. h3 be5 is given as better by pmca black connects her rooks and is now threatening to take on f3 followed by qxh2. black has a great advantage. white takes. but this is a blunder by black. pmca gives … rxe2 21. qxe2 bxf3 22. be5 qxe5 23. qxe5 bxe5 24. gxf3 re8 25. kg2 bd4 26. rh1 h6 27. a4 rd8 28. rc1 be5 as best, but as black i would have been tempted to play 20....b(c6) x n(f3) immediately  this is a very clever move. if black plays b(c6)xn(d5) then white can mate in two starting with r(e2)xr(e8)  black also has to protect bc7 white takes now black takes back white mobilises her other rook.  black takes white takes back black hits the queen queen drops back, keeping a protection on nf3 black advances her queen white takes. this seems to me o be the obvious move, but pmca gives it as a mistake and suggests qb4 27. re5 qxb2 28. rxe8+ bxe8 29. qd2 qb1+ 30. qe1 qxe1+ 31. nxe1 kf8 32. d4 ke7 33. nd3 bc6 34. nf4 kd6 35. nh5 g6 36. nf6 h6 as the best continuation for black. white's king side pawns are now split, but black has to be careful as her own back rank is weak, for example if re8-e6?? rc5-c8 mating! with a double attack on the rc5 and also threatening re1 forking king and queen. so the rook drops back, and white's pawns start to drop. pmca gives 28. qc2 h6 29. rc8 rxc8 30. qxc8+ kh7 31. qf5+ kg8 32. qe5 qa4 33. kg2 qxa2 34. qe8+ kh7 35. qe4+ g6 36. qxb7 kg7 37. d4 as a better alternative, but not many players would allow checks on e1. so one pawn goes this doesn't seem to achieve much. pmca gives 29. rb1 qxa2 30. rxb7 qd5 31. ra7 qg5+ 32. kf1 qh6 33. kg2 qg6+ 34. kf1 qh5 as better. at least white's deficit is held to just one pawn in this line! another way to save the second pawn would have been rc1-c2 losing a second pawn makes things hard for white white hits the queen, but only to drive it to a better square it is nicely centralised here, ready for action on either side of the board. white just gives up a third pawn without a fight. pmca gives 31. d4 b5 32. re2 rxe2 33. qxe2 kf8 34. qc2 qd6 35. qxh7 qxd4 36. qc2 qf6 37. qc8+ ke7 38. qg4 kd8 as better. so white takes. this is the best counter-attacking hope. now black blunders, and gives up the advantage she has carefully secured. qg6+ 33. kh1 qe6 34. rc4 qh3 35. qd1 b5 36. re4 ra8 37. re5 qh4 38. qd7 rf8 39. kg2 b4 40. qc6 qd4 41. re7 is given as better by pmca white cleverly attacks the rook again. the rook seeks sanctuary. and white misses her big chance. she could have drawn with 34. qc5 rd8 35. qc7 qg6+ 36. kh1 qb1+ 37. kg2 qg6+ qg6+ 35. kh1 qb1+ 36. kg2 qb4 37. rxf8+ qxf8 38. qxb7 a5 39. qc6 g6 40. kg3 qb8+ 41. kg2 qb4 is given as even better for white in the pmca white now starts to get the pawns back. black takes. white takes back queen has to block now the second pawn goes, white has re-established material equality, and black's advantage is minimal and based on the split pawns on the kingside. white should be able to draw this. the queen improves her position white advances a pawn. as white i would be tempted to just sit on the position, play something like q-c4-g4 maybe h2-h3 and just wait for black to come at me. i think the white queen belongs on the kingside, protecting the king and pawns there. so black avoids unpleasant back rank threats. king advances black advances her king i am not sure what this achieves. qe2 seems better to me. black wants to attack with the king supporting the queen. this is a very poor move. pmca gives 41. qb7 f6 42. qe4 qd7 43. qf3 qd6 44. qe3 qd1 45. qe7 qg1+ 46. kh3 qf1+ 47. kg3 qd3+ 48. qe3 qd6 49. qe8 as better, but i like simply 41. qe2 preventing the black king from advancing. i don't see how black can then make any more progress. now black starts to win pawns again. white throws in a check, no doubt hoping for kh6?? allowing qg5!! and a draw. however black has better. now the h pawn is doomed, and so is white. probably best, otherwise the f4 pawn goes too. so one pawn goes. forced! queen goes back, ready to strike down the d file, or return to the kingside, as required white hits the h7 pawn. black protects. another blunder, another pawn goes. pmca gives 41. qb7 f6 42. qe4 qd7 43. qf3 qd6 44. qe3 qd1 45. qe7 qg1+ 46. kh3 qf1+ 47. kg3 qd3+ 48. qe3 qd6 49. qe8, although i would have probably played qe5 so queen checks forced again another pawn goes. queen retreats queen check king up black attacks the pawn. this is given as another mistake, and pmca suggests 50. kg3 g5 51. qh1+ kg6 52. qb1 qe6 53. qb7 h5 54. qb1 h4+ 55. kf2 qd5 56. qb8 qe6 57. qb1 white has no sensible moves, and has the unenviable choice between losing a third pawn or allowing a queen exchange into a hopeless ending. white allows the queen exchange. black takes and white finally gives up. many thanks for reading, i hope you enjoyed it. don't forget to rate it on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am getting on. until next time dear reader!

isso me surpreendeu.ele costuma jogar uma linha mais posicional na siciliana,com be2 e 0-0 acho que ele não esperava por isso nessa posição eu tinha 12 min de tempo gasto no relógio;ele 50. um equívoco meu .aqui o lance é 14-de5!,com forte pressão real.o que resultou no tabuleiro não passou de uma pressão psicológica;o fritz diz que c3 para tudo,mas ele não tem preocupações, sentimentos ou sensações, e carlos alberto não é um adversário tão frio. recohecendo minha imprecisão tentei empatar... ele não quis... então vamo pra briga!! salve o engano,mas até aqui tem partidas no chessbase de fortes jogadores que chegaram a essa posição... já nessa, não tem nenhuma! ele refletiu bem uns 12 min pra fazer essa tomada,e capturou minha peça com "!!!" viu porque a "!!!" ? mas... "!!!!" aqui ele refletiu mais uns 5 min."não contavam com minha astúcia"! eu e o chapolim colorado. propus tablas.o fritz me dá uma leve vantagem posicional e o tempo dele está bem inferior.forçar pra quê? era a segunda rodada ainda... 
-------------------------------------
ik heb gemerkt dat jij in onze partijen meestal opent met e2-e4 en daar is zeker niets mis mee. veel trainers bevelen deze zet aan voor beginners, omdat de partij vaak in rap tempo tactisch wordt. dit is belangrijk, omdat de uitslag van schaakpartijen voor verreweg de grootste deel afhankelijk is van de tactische sterkte van de spelers.   nadat ik zoveel nadruk leg op tactiek vraag jij je waarschijnlijk af wat tactiek in het schaakspel nou is. aangezien ik nu genant veel moeite heb om een korte uitleg te geven, zal ik jou helaas moeten vervelen met een zeer lange uitleg.   het uiteindelijke doel van schaken is het schaakmat zetten van de tegenstander. in de vorige partij die ik analyseerde gaf jij twee stukken weg, zodat jij de koning van de tegenstander beter kon aanvallen. jouw tegenstander verdedigde echter tegen de dreigingen, begon stukken af te ruilen en kon jou uiteindelijk mat zetten toen jij geen stukken meer over had. een directe koningsaanval heeft dus lang niet altijd zin en ik zal later eens uitleggen hoe jij kunt inschatten wanneer een koningsaanval kans heeft op slagen en wanneer niet. ik ga er nu niet op in, omdat op jouw sterkte partijen meestal worden gewonnen door het verkrijgen van een ruime materiaal voordeel. ik geloof dat jij nu enigzins weet hoe de waarde van de stukken verhouden ten opzichte van elkaar en dus zal ik daar niet diep op in gaan. wel zal ik zeggen dat zelfs een pion (de minst waardevolle eenhoud van jouw team) het verschil kan maken tussen winst en verlies. je mag hem dus niet zonder nadenken offeren of weggeven. materiaal is belangrijk! hoe ontstaan verschillen in materiaal? ze ontstaan doordat stukken van verschillende waarde met elkaar worden geruild of omdat een stuk/pion gratis gepakt kan worden. als jij ziet dat materiaal van de tegenstander gepakt kan worden zonder dat het jou iets kost dan is dat gunstig voor jou en moet jij er voor gaan. als jij iets kan pakken van de tegenstander dat een grotere waarde heeft dan de stuk/pion die jij er voor moet geven dan is dat ook gunstig. kijk er echter tegerlijkertijd voor uit dat jijzelf geen van zulke kansen geeft voor de tegenstander. hopelijk heb ik tot nu toe niets gezegd dat helemaal nieuw voor jou is en ik denk dat jij bovenstaand al goed begrijpt. toch zal je merken dat jij soms materiaal verliest, terwijl jij dacht dat de tegenstander niets gratis kon pakken. plotseling bedreigt één zet van de tegenstander meerdere stukken van jou en je kan niet voorkomen dat er iets genomen gaat worden. dat is tactiek. op zijn simpelst is tactiek een dubbelaanval. er wordt met één zet meer bedreigt dan dat er met één zet verdedigt kan worden. er zijn echter ook andere motieven waarmee materiaalwinst kan worden afgedwongen. het is erg belangrijk in schaken om te herkennen wanneer jij een kans hebt om materiaalwinst af te dwingen door zulke tactische wendingen. het is minstens zo belangrijk om te herkennen wanneer jijzelf kwetsbaar bent voor iets dergelijks. bij de vorige zet zei ik dat e2-e4 leidt tot meer tactische stellingen. daarmee bedoel ik dat je vaak posities op het bord krijgt waar tactische wendingen mogelijk zijn. na bijvoorbeeld de volgende zetten: 1. e2-e4        e7-e5 2. pg1-pf3     pc8-pc6 3. lf1-b5 de witte paard valt de pion op e5 aan en dus heeft zwart hem verdedigt met zijn paard. als wit de pion nu zou nemen, zou dat hem een paard kosten. met zijn laatste zet valt wit echter de verdediger van de pion aan. als zwart een zet zou passen kan wit de zwarte paard nemen met zijn loper en nadat zwart de loper terug neemt kan wit de pion op e5 alsnog nemen met zijn paard, want de verdediger is weg. deze tactische motief (het aanvallen/verwijderen van de verdediger) komt erg vaak voor en is zeker iets om op te letten.  zwart speelt e7-e6, de franse verdediging. net als na e7-e5 maakt de pion de weg vrij voor de loper en dame, doordat de pion zich echter een beetje inhoudt, heeft zwart minder ruimte in de centrum. dat kan het moeilijker maken om bepaalde stukken actief te maken. daar tegenover staat dat wit minder zwaktes heeft om op te mikken. er is geen hangende pion dat verdediging nodig heeft en het zwakke punt f7 is minder gemakkelijk om aan te vallen. meestal wordt deze zet opgevolgd door d7-d5, zodat zwart alsnog een aandeel heeft in de centrum. in deze partij heeft zwart iets anders voor ogen. prima. jij neemt een groot aandeel in de centrum en opent de weg voor jouw stukken om actieve velden te vinden. niet echt goed of slecht, slechts mogelijk. zwart ontwikkelt een stuk en valt jouw d-pion aan. de d-pion is op het moment verdedigt door de dame en zwart kan hem daarom niet nemen.  jij besluit nog meer ruimte te nemen. geen slechte beslissing, maar wees bij een grote centrum bewust dat hij ook een groot doelwit is. hou goed in de gaten of de centrumpionnen wel of niet genomen kunnen worden en negeer jouw stuk ontwikkeling niet. goed, de schaak wordt onderbroken en een stuk wordt 'actief' gemaakt. de paard kan echter helaas niet bewegen, omdat zijn eigen koning er achter staat. situaties waarin stukken niet mogen bewegen, omdat een lijn onderbroken moet blijven worden penningen genoemd. in dit geval is de paard het gepende stuk. penningen worden gerekend tot de tactische motieven, omdat het makkelijk is materiaal te verliezen in een dergelijke situatie.  zwart blijft zijn stukken snel naar buiten halen en is nu klaar voor rochade. tevens valt de paard nu de pion op e4 aan. op eerste gezicht lijkt het misschien dat deze pion verdedigt wordt door de paard op c3. helaas is deze paard gepend en zal hij niet terug kunnen nemen op e4. gepende stukken zijn slechte verdedigers! omdat de paard op c3 geen echte verdediger is, kan de pion op e4 gratis genomen worden als wit hem niet verdedigt. er moet dus een verdediger voor e4 gevonden worden. helaas voor wit is dit nog redelijk lastig. lf1-d3 dekt de pion op e4, maar blokkeert de verdediging die de dame geeft aan de pion op d4. een ander idee is lc1-d2. hierna staat de paard op c3 niet meer gepend en heeft de e4-pion een echte verdediger. helaas blokkeert dit wederom de verdediging van de d4-pion, maar er is nog een probleem. zelfs als de paard niet gepend zou staan, kan zwart een pion winnen door eerst de paard te slaan met zijn loper (lb4xc3). de verdediger wordt weer uitgeschakeld, zodat de pion gratis kan worden genomen. dd1-d3 dekt werkelijk alle pionnen en voor de moment hoeft wit geen materiaal te verliezen. het is echter wel een beetje vernederend voor een machtige dame om kleine pionnetjes te moeten dekken. ook kan een dame makkelijk worden weggejaagd van zijn verdediging vanwege zijn grote waarde. ik zou hier waarschijnlijk e4-e5 gespeeld hebben. ?  de eerste fout van de partij. de gepende paard op c3 gaf geen dekking aan de pion op e4 en dus kan zwart hem nu gratis nemen. beter was dd1-d3 of e4-e5. de positie wordt ingewikkelder en tactischer. beide zijden moet goed opletten wat voor mogelijkheden de tegenstander heeft. jij had waarschijnlijk gemerkt dat de paard gepend was en had daarom besloten om hem snel te bevrijden. de paard is nu niet meer gepend aan de koning. ook geeft de loper nu extra dekking aan de paard op c3 die twee maal wordt aangevallen (door paard en loper).  daar staat tegenover dat de pion op d4 nu niet meer gedekt wordt door de dame. de hangende stuk op e4 is echter meer waard als de hangende pion op d4 en dus is dit geen probleem. als zwart de pion op d4 neemt kan jij de paard op e4 nemen. een paard is veel meer waard als twee pionnen en de materiaal voordeel zal jou de betere winstkansen geven. als zwart besluit eerst de paard af te ruilen, kan jij terugnemen met de loper, waarna de pion op d4 zijn verdediging terug krijgt. dit zou desondanks een stuk beter zijn geweest. de extra pion die zwart in die variatie zou hebben gehad, geeft hem een duidelijk voordeel. ? gewoon een foutje zwart heeft zijn paard weggegeven en heeft er te weinig voor terug. wit heeft hier een duidelijk voordeel. ?! de zwarte loper stond aangevallen en dus moest er iets aan gedaan worden. zwart besloot zijn loper terug te trekken, maar hij had ook de optie om de loper af te ruilen op d2 of te verdedigen met bijvoorbeeld de8-e7. de beslissing is niet een makkelijke om te maken. door de verlies van een paard staat zwart materiaal achter en dat lijkt te betekenen dat hij zoveel mogelijk materiaal op het bord moet houden, terwijl wit zoveel mogelijk zou willen afruilen. het verschil van dat ene paard wordt immers groter naarmate er minder materiaal op het bord staat. volgens die principe deed zwart de juiste beslissing door de loper op het bord te houden.  zwart moet echter ook rekening houden met de aanvalsmogelijkheden van wit. wit heeft nu meer actieve stukken als zwart en kan aardig wat druk zetten op de zwarte kamp. door de activiteit van zijn stukken kan wit zelfs tactische mogelijkheden krijgen. afruil zou in die opzicht misschien juist geweest zijn om een beetje druk uit de stelling te houden. het kan erg lastig zijn om dergelijke conflicterende afwegingen tegen elkaar op te wegen. ik vermoed dat afruil beter zou zijn geweest. ?! een volgende tactische motief: de ontdekte aanval. het vertrekken van de loper opent de aanval van de witte dame op de paard op d4. ontdekte aanvallen kunnen erg sterk zijn, omdat er zo makkelijk een dubbele dreiging kan worden opgezet. als de loper een ongedekte pion/stuk zou aanvallen, zouden er twee stukken/pionnen verdedigd moeten worden door de tegenstander. helaas kan wit in dit geval geen goed gebruik maken van de ontdekte aanval, want de zwarte paard is de enige voor de hand liggende doelwit. -vraagje 1 = waarom zou loper naar h6 niet werken? de loper zou een pion (g7) aanvallen die niet verdedigd is en de paard zou worden aangevallen door de dame.- (antwoorden op vragen aan de einde van de partij. als je het liever niet wilt doen, kan je natuurlijk direct naar het einde gaan om het antwoord te lezen.) wit heeft echter een andere tactische wapen beschikbaar door de activiteit van zijn stukken. als wit op dit moment ld2-c3 zou spelen, zou zwart grote problemen hebben. de paard is zwaar onder vuur, maar als hij vertrekt wordt er een lijn naar g7 geopent. hij lijkt dus gepend te zijn aan de pion op g7. maar wacht eens even, zwart kan zijn paard op f5 zetten (pd4-f5) en op die manier zowel pion als paard redden. op dat moment komt echter een andere tactische motief naar voren. als de zwarte paard op f5 staat is hij de enige verdediger van de pion op g7. zulke verdedigers vallen wij aan. na g7-g5 staat de zwarte paard aangevallen door een pion, maar als hij vlucht kan de witte loper op c3 de pion op g7 slaan (lc3xg7). na ld2-c3 wint wit een pion.  de tactische mogelijkheden kwamen, omdat de witte stukken actiever waren als die van zwart en omdat zwart hangend (onverdedigd) materiaal heeft. ? in de partij speelde jij echter la5. de loperzet opende de aanval op de paard, maar hier valt helaas makkelijk tegen te verdedigen. na pd4-c6 zou zwart zijn paard in veiligheid hebben gebracht en de loper aanvallen. aangezien wit de loper moet verdedigen of terugtrekken heeft hij/zij onnodig tijd verloren. in de partij koos zwart echter voor b6. hij krijgt voor zijn paard jouw loper, maar rekent niet ver genoeg. nadat jij de paard neemt, valt jouw dame namelijk zijn pion op g7 aan. zwart verliest dus onnodig een pion. ?! zwart besluit om zijn koning op e7 te gaan zetten, zodat de dame zijn aangevallen toren zou dekken. dit plan heeft echter een groot probleem. het was beter om de loper op e7 te houden, zodat de veld f6 bewaakt blijft. wit houdt terecht zijn paard in de centrum! de combinatie paar + dame kan erg dodelijk en zwart heeft geen actieve stukken om de witte koning mee te bedreigen. wellicht was f1 een veiligere veld voor de koning. ? dit had de partij direct kunnen verliezen. wit heeft een grote kans om zijn materiaalvoordeel te vergroten met een mooie toren. ? jammer, je had gezien dat de veld f6 zwak was voor zwart, maar helaas de verkeerde stuk er neer gezet. dg7-f6 met schaak zou erg sterk zijn geweest.  12. dg7-f6+    ke7-e8/f8 (de koning moet terug en daardoor is de toren onverdedigd) 13. df6xh8+    ke8/f8-e7 14. dh8xd8+  (wit heeft een grote materiaal voordeel en wil dus graag verder afruilen.) door de gemiste kans blijft zwart enigzins in leven. de koning van wit is immers ook niet al te veilig. ? een erg vreemde zet. ik snap niet waarom zwart dit zou willen doen. de koning is hier nog onveiliger en zwart mist een kans op tegenspel. ik heb geen computeranalyse bij de hand, maar d7-d5 lijkt mij gevaarlijker voor wit. waarschijnlijk is wit nog steeds oke met een paar verdedigende zetten (c4-c5 om de d-lijn dicht te houden?), maar het is beter dan kd6. de positie is complex en ik ben moe. een gedetaileerde analyse komt hier dus niet. mijn gevoel zegt mij dat pf6-e4 met schaak een goede zet moet zijn. de zwarte koning is in veel gevaar. kd6-e7 zou verliezen door dg7-f6+ met hetzelfde idee (en positie) als voorheen.  wit heeft veel goede opties beschikbaar. ik zat zelf te denken aan dg7-d4 en le2-f3, maar jouw zet moet ook afdoende zijn. wit staat er hier erg goed voor. zwart activeert een stuk en valt jouw dame aan. wit blijft echter beter ontwikkelt, heeft de veiligere koning en een materiaal voordeel.  wellicht was de dame na dg7xf7 iets actiever. dg7-e5 lijkt mij ook erg gevaarlijk. zwart heeft hoe dan ook grote problemen. zwart pakt een pion en probeert wat activiteit te genereren. wit blijft echter veel beter staan en zou hier moeten winnen. nog steeds goed bezig! wanneer jij een koning aanvalt, lijkt jouw spel een stuk beter te worden. je pakt nog een pion en vegroot jouw materiaal voordeel, maar het was waarschijnlijk nog veel sterker om verder te gaan met de koningsaanval. le2-f3 lijkt bijvoorbeeld erg sterk, want er worden dan ontdekte schaakjes gedreigt. ?! wit kan hierna de partij afmaken, maar zwart stond al erg slecht. ?! je blijft gewonnen staan, maar je had de spanning er al uit kunnen halen. beter is: 18 df7-d5+   kb7-b8  (kb7-a6 verliest onmiddelijk door dd5-b5# schaakmat) 19 pd4-c6+   d7xc6 20 dd5xd8  (na de dameverlies is er helemaal geen hoop meer voor zwart)  jouw zet was tamelijk slordig, want de paard op d4 was een belangrijke aanvaller. het geeft wel aan hoe sterk jij staat als je een paard kan weggeven en nog steeds gewonnen staat. ! goed gezien! de toren heeft geen vluchtvelden. als bijvoorbeeld tg2-g8 wordt gespeeld kan wit antwoorden met df2xg8!. als zwart dan de toren terugneemt, kan wit met pe4-f6+ de dame weer terugwinnen.  wanhoop? ! een erg mooie zet. de pion op c7 kan de paard niet slaan, omdat de koning erachter staat. weer een penning dus. de dame kan de paard niet echt slaan, omdat de pion dan zou terugnemen. zwart kan het zich absoluut niet veroorloven om ook nog eens zijn dame te verliezen. dit staat een mat in paar zetten toe, maar zwart was toch al kapot gespeeld. het grijpen van de toren verzekert wit van een materiale voordeel, maar df7xd5+ zag er ook best wel sterk uit. ta1-c1+ zou beter zijn geweest, maar dit is ook prima. je hebt een sterke partij gespeeld en hebt hier een beslissende materiaalvoordeel met aanvalskansen. weer een ontdekte aanval. de loper valt de koning aan en de dame valt nu de witte loper op a8 aan. wit kan zich hier echter makkelijk uit redden. ?  vanaf hier gaat het allemaal mis en dat is erg zonde want je had een prima partij gespeeld. la8-f3 zou de stuk hebben gered. ook na deze fout sta jij gewonnen, maar je moet nu iets meer uitkijken. ? je had meerdere zetten beschikbaar om jouw koning in leven te houden, helaas was dit er niet één van. de zwarte dame voegt zich nu bij de aanval op de witte koning. zwart grijpt zijn kans. ? en hierna is de mat geforceerd. ontzettend zonde. kc2-c1 ziet er anders ook niet fraai uit. ? db5-e2+ zou tot mat hebben geleid. nu kan de witte koning naar b1 vluchten. ? na kc2-b1 heeft de koning relatieve veiligheid gevonden. na bijvoorbeeld d3-d2 kan wit a2-a3 spelen met een vluchtveld op a2. ? kb6 lijkt sterker en wint waarschijnlijk. ? dit staat schaakmat toe, kc1-c2 moest geprobeerd worden. antwoorden: vraagje 1 =  jouw eerste gedachte zou kunnen zijn dat zwart gewoon de loper kan nemen. loper en paard zijn ongeveer even veel waard en dus zou alles nog oke zijn voor zwart. g7xh6 zou echter slechte gevolgen hebben voor zwart. 8. ...  gxh6 9. dxd4 (met aanval op de toren op h8) zwart is in groot gevaar, want zijn structuur op de koningszijde is ernstig verzwakt. de juiste zet voor zwart zou de simpele pd4-f5 zijn. de paard gaat weg uit de aanval, verdedigt zijn pion op g7 en valt de loper op h6 aan. de loper zal moeten terugtrekken en heeft dus tijd verspild. 
-------------------------------------
zukertort opening. the third most popular initial move. a flexible opening. a popular response to the zukertort opening. black stakes a claim to the center. standard move. transposing to a closed game. until now, we have a standard opening. here, black departs from the standard response, which would have been 3...nf6. however, he plays it on the next move. clears the way to castle. so far, white has played a stronger opening than black. white's formation is approaching an approximation of the colle-zukertort system. meanwhile, black has been advancing his kingside pawns without doing anything about king safety. indeed, king safety becomes a problem for black before long. by now white has made departures from the colle-zukertort system. in the mainline colle-zukertort system, white's queenside bishop moves to b2 to exert additional pressure on the a1-h8 diagonal; indeed, this is the purpose of playing b3 in the first place. nonetheless, white's formation still holds black's pawns at d5 and e6 and causes mobility problems for black. not a good move. white can now respond with: attacks black's knight, forcing it to retreat. the knight's mobility is now severely hampered. attacks white's pawn, which is now attacked twice (by the pawn at c6 and the bishop at d7) and protected only once. protects white's b pawn. black decides to trade pawns, which eliminates white's only advanced pawn and isolate white's a pawn. however, this exchange puts white's knight in a strong tactical position. white can mate on the next turn with nd6 unless black responds. black moves his queen to a square where it can simultaneously attack the white knight at b5, the white knight's threatened mating square at d6, and the white knight's threatened forking square at c7. protects the knight a second time. this prevents black from gaining a material advantage by capturing the knight. ! white now has two advanced knights. black must be careful to avoid a misstep. +/= black had stronger moves available, such as 15...bg7, which prepares for kingside castling and threatens to attack white's powerful knight at e5. it's not particularly easy to see, but a stronger move here would have been 16.c4!, which would make it very easy for black to misstep and lose a queen. for example, if black played 16...dxc4, white could recapture with 17.nxc4, attacking the queen and leaving it with no way to escape. on the other hand, if black ignored white's pawn on c4, the pawn could advance on the next turn to c5 and threaten the queen directly. black would have responses that save the queen, but most would come at a cost. attacks white's pawn. black hopes to take advantage of his rook's control of the h file. white brings a third piece to bear on the focal point at b5. attacks white's f and h pawns simultaneously. with this recapture, the two sides are even in material, but white's h pawn is left en prise. attacks white's g pawn. black is now ahead by a pawn in material. =/+ discovered attack on black's queen. however, this retreat by the knight releases the pressure on black's king. again, c4 would have been a stronger move and could have been played at any point in the last several moves, but the opportunity is now lost. moves the queen to safety. protects the g pawn. protects the rook, in case white should try to drive it back. white rethinks her decision to abandon the b5 square. attacks the queen. ! this time, black takes the opportunity to eliminate the troublesome knight. this does not result in any material gain, since white will immediately recapture, but it relieves the pressure on black's king and other major pieces. ! blocks the check. results in another minor-piece exchange. this is not helpful for white, because she is quickly losing her most advanced pieces, and she is down in material anyway. slightly better is kg2, preparing to deal with black's rook on h3. ? white's queen seems to be aiming for something here—perhaps trying to exert pressure on black's g pawn or perhaps aiming to reinforce the rook on the open b file--but she inadvertently hangs her g pawn. better would have been 24.kg2. ! black exploits the vulnerability and takes the pawn. blacks is now ahead two pawns in material. more importantly, white's king is under serious threat. attacks black's rook. the only good response to the check. ! protects black's rook. forced. attacks white's rook. black hopes to seize the open file by force. ?? white's bishop hangs itself at a5. probably white was hoping that this would distract the queen and allow white to play 28.rxb8+, winning the exchange, but white fails to notice that when black plays 27...qxa5+ it will put the king in check, leaving white unable to carry out her plan. (or black can play rxb1+, which has largely the same effect.) this is the only serious error that white makes in the game, but it comes at a bad time. black can now force a checkmate in two moves, although he actually takes five. much better would have been 27.rc1. ! black sees the opportunity to checkmate and executes it, nullifying the attack on his queen. forced. ? black could have checkmated here with 28...rxe3#. forced.

most popular move. normal. trying fried liver attack. i can now play ng5 (fried liver attack) still normal. an attacking move. after 6. kxf7 7. qf3+ threatening knight on d5. (?) king goes straight back to his normal square. free knight. queen swap. why not? threatening nxc2+, winning rook. another attacker on c2. blocking c2, probably the best move. (?) i didn't, don't and don't think ever will understand this move. getting rid of the annoying knight. (!) winning free pawn on f6. if: 14. kf7? nxc7+! winning rook. it works the same if black plays ke6. developing with tempo. threatening my bishop, who is protecting my knight. i swap, bishop for knight. probably the best move. if i had played ba4, this is what would have happened… 18. b5 19. bb3 nxb3 20. cxb3 bxd3 (winning free pawn) a swap that i don't usually like, especially when it doubles my pawns. i have lost my d-pawn. threatening mate: rd1# blocking mate and threatening the bishop. now my pawn is threatened. two attackers, one protector. protecting and threatening. if i had left my rook on f1, bd3+ pretty much wins the game. plays it anyway. good move, now my pawn on f3 is almost lost. it stops me from playing ke2. a skewer, winning pawn after bb5. dammit. (!) threatening the protector of the bishop. the game is now equal, but black has an advantage position wise. i check the king again. threatening the c-pawn. only way. damn it! down a pawn. swap? why not? both kings wanting to get into each other's territory. the f, g and h files are al blocked for the black king. my only hope is to go for the queen. i ignore the pawn. (??????) loses, after my opponent made this move, i muttered softly, yes! (!) gets the queen. after hxg6, then black plays bc4, and my queening square is controlled by the bishop. don't ask me why i suicided, i was just excited about getting a queen. yes!!!!!!!! wins pawn. i must stop black from queening. two squares! my phone rings and i lose the game. i just said i won it on this annotated game because i only a few moves away from mate. anyway, the moral is: never bring your mobile phone to a chess tournament! 
-------------------------------------
my favorite: king pawn, although i played it differently to how i play it now. sicilian defense. following the classical opening principle: knights before bishops. all four knights have been developed early. i castle early. ? a waste of a move. wanting to castle. blocking in the bishop. see why i do king pawn differently now? unusual, i would've castled by now. this also weakens the a6 pawn, unless the bishop doesn't develop. i accept the swap. or else: d4 forking knight and bishop. attacking, except doubles pawns. my only safe square except for b1. wanting my knight back where he wants to be. not swapping? now my knight is back in the action. looking for any possibilities of an attack. threatening my bishop. ? bishop for knight? ? why would he do this, i love swapping queens, and he's doubling pawns. my knight wants his c3 square back. fine, i love swaps. wanting to swap, but i should be trying to exploit his missing h-pawn weakness, if i could get both rooks there… wanting to still own the file, i guess. but i love swaps. see? now begins the race of the kings. at first, i thought of kc3, but i think this is better. i don't want black in my territory. liking my position. the knight for bishop swap was better for me. ? now after axb5+ kxb5 h5 ka4 a5 a6 b6 or c6, i win the c4 pawn. it worked. at this point i am going for the queen with only my pawn and king. somewhere around this point, my opponent offers a draw. no way!! this is where i change my mind and go for the f5 and g7 pawns, and then i want to queen. my opponent resigns, there is nothing to stop me from queening my h-pawn from queening. thanks for reading, and thanks for the game james! 
-------------------------------------
1.d4. i´m more of an e4 player, and when playing black i always defend with the sicilian defense. but anyways any time i see d4 i immediately go with...  1...nf6.  this was my first surprise, i though i would see the traditional 3.nc3. i just followed the book here. i think more common is 4.nf3 i liked this move, trying to get control of the h2-b8 diagonal, and also supporting the e5 advance, although i was expecting a move like 6.c4 to follow.  and here it is.  always controlling the same diagonal.  another supporter for the e5 advance, and with the option to maybe play b3 later on the game.  another one, its time to advance the pawn.  this bishop move looks kinda awkward, i think he was doing a good job on d3, i knew he wanted to form a battery along the b1-h7 diagonal as soon as he played this move.  here it comes.  and here is the battery, but its useless unless he find the way to get rid of my knight at f6. but a move like 12.ng5 could be hard to deal with. when the only defense against it would be g6 if i don't wanna lose a pawn.  maybe best here was 11.re1 followed by his own advance of the e pawn. i was thinking now to play h6... but i instead decided to advance my pawn, preventing any kind of threats along the b1-h7 diagonal, and freeing the scope for my bishop at c2 and here comes the sacrifice, only because i was able to get rid of the white knight at f3 i was encouraged to go ahead and do it.  the sacrifice is accepted.  if the king goes back to the back rank qh4 would be the end of the game. or if instead 14.kh4 i would have then played 14...nd-f3 and now i have a discovered check with my bishop at c1. okay now, i thought a lot about this move, a second sacrifice with poison on it.  of course the knight cannot be taken, it would lead to mate. just an example. (15.kxg4 nf8+  16.kh5 g6+  17.kg5 h6+ 18.kxh6 qh2+ 19.kg5 nh7#) its mate in every variation, so this following move is the reason i thought a lot about qc7 freeing my bishop at c8 and threatening nh5+ with the same nh5+ intention.  look at white pieces they are all stuck on the queen side, and almost all of them are on the back rank not to mention his rook at a1 its useless, not a good position to be in. here it comes i´m not sure about this move, maybe just moving his king to h3 would have been better.  finally his bishop moved. but its doing nothing. but what else? he needs to untangle his pieces i guess.  taking control of the h4-d8 diagonal, with the threat of h4+ again what else? all white pieces are on the back pretty far away from the king, unable to defend, unable to attack.  take this the only move ok. now i want to occupy the half open file with my rook.   i think i will use that discovered check now. thanks.  now if he takes the pawn rg8+ will follow. for example 24.kxg3 rg8+ 25.kf2 (if he doesn't want to get matted) qh4+ 26.kxe3 (the only move) and now the simple 26...qg3+ with mate to follow. so in order to prolong the agony he would have been forced to play qg4. (i created a mate in 6 puzzle of it, you can check it out if you want) just protecting my f7 pawn and now this move was the final blunder allowing me to penetrate in white position even further keeping the king on the back rank, this is a lost game for white.  anyways, he finally frees his rook but its a little bit too late.  if 29.kh2 then qxf4 wins anyways forcing him to capture the pawn.  black resigns at this point everything went downhill for him after my 11th move.  by the way this was not the best move... the best move here was 32...rg1+  33.ke2 (and only then) ng3#.  anyways, not the best chess but thats how my brain works. i hope you can get something out of this game.

an invitation to the london system. you don´t see it much in high-level chess, but gm miles played it many times. it is solid, the burden of theory is not too overwhelming, and it has quite a bit of venom if black plays in a careless manner. my opponent takes the "chigorin-approach" to the opening. it doesn´t really challenge the white centre, but it is quite solid. white has wasted a tempo by playing bf4 and now bg5, but the position is rather closed, and exchanging bishops on d6 only helps blacks development. an alternative could be 6. bg3. after 6. - bxg3 7. hxg3 white has a nice half-open file for the rook, but there is not much advantage in that as long as black hasn´t castled short. this is not the standard pawn move in the london system, but since black didn´t choose to challenge the centre with a move like c7-c5, i think this is the most active continuation for white. black could also try to go "all in" with a move like 9. - g5!? the strategy then would be exchange of dark-squared bishops on g3 and 0-0-0, leading to a complicated middle-game. keeping the c6-knight away from b4. i think the next move is a waste of time. (?!) maybe my memory deludes me, but i think this maneouvre (ra1-c1 and bd3-b1) was something bobby fischer was fond of. the bishop is safely tucked away, and it is a constant threat to to square h7. perhaps that kind of simple strategy works better in blitz though ... my opponent decides to get rid of the "london-bishop". probably a good choice. his position is solid enough, but there are some potential weaknesses in the horizon: square c7 and the beautiful knight on d5 which can be chased away with a e3-e4 thrust. (?) wrong rook! i think 16. - rfc8 followed by 17. - rab8 would have sealed the q-side pretty well. in a few moves white has grabbed the initiative. now the central pawns start moving, and the knights start dancing ... threating 21. e5 and 22. qh7 . now one of blacks knights are out of play, and white wins the important e5-pawn. the pawn on e4 has re-gained it´s mobillity, and the threat on h7 persists. gm bent larsen once commented that with a knight on f8, you can´t get mated! i guess that is where this knight is heading for, but whites central pawns are travelling too fast. (!) the knight on d5 can´t be taken, since it will cost the black queen for rook and knight. whites attack is too strong for this kind of exchanges. the d- and e-pawns have almost reached the "goal-line" with the help of the knight-pair. the game is over, but black fought on for some more moves. and why not? errors could still be made! 39. qd8 is an alternative, but almost everything wins. and black resigned. 
-------------------------------------
 na proxima jogada dele, ja sabia que iria perder a torre.. minha escolha é perde-la mas preendendo a rainha ... como disse , defender com o piao 7g não iria resolver o problema ... peder a torre e o cavalo , alem de deixar a rainha livre... por isso optei por mover o rei..
-------------------------------------
  neste momento, isolei a rainha do meu adversario ... o estrago foi amenizado.. o problema é que meu jogo esta totalmente preso também. na minha opinião, o 0-0 foi muito cedo... já definiu minha área de ataque... com a rainha isolada, comecei a trabalhar para pega-la e virar a vantagem dele.
-------------------------------------
 outra coisa nesta joda é  para liberar minhas peças. esse lance , foi para aumentar as chances deliberar a rainha ...  meu erro... fiquei tão preocupado que a rainha branca pudesse pegar meu piao g6, que fiz o movimento do cavalo antecipadamente e fazendo meu pião f6 com uma unica desefa.. a do piao que defendia o cavalo. agora foi a jogaga certa.. trocar bisbo por cavalo...  e a rainha dele escapa e aumenta mais a vantagem... (depois de tudo fiz uma outra analise variando as jogadas, se fiz tudo certo... não achei que consegueria bloquear a rainha dele). preciso de uma saída extra para o rei.. o risco de mover para casa branca com o bispo de na área é muito alto, alem de na proxima jogada poder tirar o bisbo branco dali...  
-------------------------------------
  um ataque sem muito efeito.... ou ele estava querendo propor a troca? foi o que pensei, mas não tinha muito o que fazer... afinal ja tinha cometido dois erro, neste jogo.
-------------------------------------
  a escolha dele... trocar ? em fim... não... perdeu a oportunidade de continuar com mais peças e maior valor diminuindo as minhas chances... 
-------------------------------------
  tudo bem que ameaço meu piao g6, mas com um movimento de avanço meu pião agora em g5, esta defendido.  otima jogada... a rainha dele agora tem poucos lugares para ir... jogada de liberar suar forças de ataque... continuo avançando com os peões...  bloqueio o avanço do cavalo dele... uma jogada de duplo valor. e a rainha recua... porque?  não sei muito o porque, mas gostei de não ter a rainha branca perto....  agora eu gostei... dobrei a defesa do pião f5 e liberei espaço para rainha preta... meu novo objetivo ... chegar ao rei pelo corredor da torre do rei. um boa jogada... liberar espaço para o cavalo em b3.. mas estou defendido.. eu não vou,  prefiro o ataque dele e eu libere minha torre em a8 meu foco.. o rei..  ótima jogada dele... prende o avanço do peão h6 com o bispo avanço meu bispo ... nova jogada boa. além de continuar com o foco no rei pelo corredor, liberei mais uma força de ataque a minha torre. um jogade de defesa e ataque... 3 peças defendendo o pião que não quero, porem fica um corredor direto para meu rei... defendido apenas por um peão.. 
-------------------------------------
 imaginei que ele viria com tudo  assim que pegar meu pião b5 continuo com meu foco... agora ataco a rainha branca... ele tem que se defender.  ainda espero que ele pegue meu pião b5, mas vai ter que esperar ... a rainha tem prioridade defesa e ataque...  uma jogada esperada e muito boa... a rainha pode ataquer em a7. essa jogada eu já tinha previsto... observe bem o que aconteceu... meu jogo esta avançado com peões,  a rainha branca esta sem movimentação de ataque... eu isolei todas as entradas ao meu rei..  agora o foco volta para o outro lado... poucas defesas e poucos ataques... a melhor jogada de ismailchess... não posso tirar meu peão do lugar a rainha branca fica com o corredor livre...  ataco !!! tenho que garantir que a torre branca não venha...  se pegar meu peão c4, problema resolvido... uso o peão branco como defesa.
-------------------------------------
  não posso tomar o peão... é minha defesa contra a rainha. avanço o peão para d5, minha melhor opçaõ. ele pode pegar meu pião em d5... acho que a troca é o melhor para ele , continua com maior número de peças.  aguardo a jogada... minhas chances são pequenas exd5.. ele falhou... cavalo pode atacar meu peão, mas tem defesa do bispo. minhar melhor jogada neste jogo. defendo o peão em e5, bloqueio o avaço do peão branco c5 para c6. o fato de desproteger a casa g6 não afeta meu jogo. aqui meu foco mudou novamente... agora vou ter que ir pelo outro lado.  não posso avançar a rainha para h7 .. será que ele liberou para eu avançar o peão para h5? não acho. outra falha dele? isso sim... apesar de estar com menos peças, o posicionamento do jogo mudou . me sinto em vantagem estratégica.  a rainha branca só pode  recuaar , liberei o corretor do bispo branco mais um casa e ainda avança o peão para d4. defesa. ataque duplo... rainha branca e peão em a2 e ainda dominei a casa b2.  novo foco... o corredor é meu.  proteger o rei antes de tudo. para ele é melhor propor a troca com a torre.  mesmo em menor número agora já acho que é vantagem, pois o cavalo dele esta inutilizado no mometo. ele tenta atacar... meu pião sem defesa. bloqueio o avanço da rainha branca... meu peão é um gladiador. retorna o cavalo para novo foco do jogo... ele perdeu jogadas preciosas.

-------------------------------------
hoi sophia! als voorbereiding op de analyse van deze partij had ik even gekeken naar mijn commentaar op twee eerdere partijen en het viel mij op dat ik soms wel erg veel schreef. ik zal proberen de commentaar hier kort en duidelijk te houden. verder wil ik er op wijzen dat je voor deze partij bijna een jaar niet hebt geschaakt. het is zeker niet erg een foutje te maken na zo'n lange afwezigheid. deze partij toont aan hoe kwetsbaar een ontwikkelde dame kan zijn in de opening, maar ook hij gevaarlijk een dergelijke dame soms kan zijn.  aangezien wij de vorige zetten al eens eerder hebben besproken, zal ik hier beginnen. in schaken is het onverstandig de beslissing tot een zet te maken zonder een doel voor ogen te hebben. het einddoel in schaken is schaakmat, maar in de opening van een partij kan dit doel nog erg ver weg en abstract lijken. voor beginners is het daarom handig de 3 gouden openingsregels te kennen:  - stukken ontwikkelen - pionnen in het centrum zetten - koning in veiligheid brengen  de zet die wit hier doet voldoet perfect aan de 3 regels. hij zet twee pionnen in het centrum en opent erg veel lijnen voor zijn stukken, zodat deze zich snel kunnen ontwikkelen. nadat wit hierna zijn stukken naar buiten heeft gebracht, kan hij snel rokeren (liefst koningszijde) en heeft hij een mooie positie om verder mee te gaan. waarom is deze zet desondanks niet de populairste zet ooit? de beste zet. de directe aanpak van wit zet druk op jouw centrum (de pion op e5) en zwart kan zich niet echt verloven om het te negeren. als jij bijvoorbeeld besluit jouw pion op e5 te verdedigen door jouw paard op veld c6 te zetten, kan hij zijn pion op d4  doorschuiven waarna hij veel ruimte heeft in het centrum en jouw paard aanvalt.   de ontwikkeling blijkt met een prijs te komen. de dame is juist de stuk die je meestal niet te snel wilt ontwikkelen juist, omdat zij zo sterk is. geen van beide spelers kan zich veroorloven de dame te verliezen en daarom kan zij makkelijk worden opgejaagd.  ?  zwart ontwikkelt een stuk en komt en stap dichter bij rokade. helaas is het echter fout, want er wordt een pion(g7) onverdedigd achter gelaten. nadat de dame deze pion neemt, zou jij de dame enigszins kunnen opjagen door met de loper naar f6 te gaan. de dame zou weg moeten gaan en zwart zou een kleine ontwikkelingsvoordeel krijgen. helaas is deze voordeeltje niet voldoende compensatie voor de verloren pion. daar komt nog bij dat na het verliezen van de pion op g7 de zwarte koning zich iets minder op zijn gemak zal voelen. probeer na elke zet niet alleen te kijken of de bewogen stuk/pion veilig staat, maar ook of er na de zet andere stukken onverdedigd achter wordt gelaten. in plaats van de loper zet zou paard naar veld c6 zou een logische zet zijn geweest en de nadeel van de witte opening aantonen. zwart ontwikkelt dan een stuk en valt de witte dame aan, waardoor wit zelf niet direct kan doorgaan met ontwikkelen. ??  een dubbele vraagteken hier, want wit laat niet alleen een grote kans liggen: hij geeft jou een grote kans om de voordeel te pakken. na b2-b3 staan er twee zware, onverdedigde stukken op dezelfde diagonaal en jouw loper staat klaar om hier gebruik van te maken. ? zwart ontwikkelt een stuk en valt de dame aan. de directe loper naar f6 zou echter sterker zijn geweest. de vroege ontwikkeling van de dame heeft de spel snel tactisch gemaakt en dus is het wat lastig om dit zonder variaties uit te leggen na loper e7-f6 wordt de dame aangevallen en als hij zou terugtrekken, kan jij een mooie onverdedigde toren (a1) grijpen. wit zou dus na le7-f6 zijn pion moeten opspelen (e4 naar e5) en wellicht was deze zet de reden waarom jij niet onmiddellijk de loper zet deed. de pion sluit niet alleen de diagonaal, maar valt de loper zelfs aan. echter zou hierna de paardzet (paard b8 - c6) de reddende zet zijn. de witte dame en de pion op e5 zou worden aangevallen en nadat wit zijn dame wegzet, kan jij de pion op e5 nemen. de extra pion in combinatie met de betere ontwikkeling zou wit een erg grote voordeel hebben gegeven. na de zet die jij doet heeft zwart nog steeds een voordeel vanwege zijn betere ontwikkeling, maar kan wit directe materiaalverlies voorkomen.  ? wit valt voor de valletje en gaat nu minstens zijn toren verliezen voor een pion. beter was bijvoorbeeld terugtrekken met de dame naar e3 of d3 en als zwart zijn toren zou aanvallen met le7-f6, zou hij zijn paard ertussen kunnen zetten (pb8-c3).  ! goed gezien. de loper valt nu zowel de witte dame aan als de toren op a1. wit zal één van beiden moeten verliezen. de buit is binnen. hierna sta jij in materiaal opzicht gewonnen. dit houdt in dat als je verder zou kunnen afruilen naar een eindspel jij een winnend voordeel zou hebben. op het moment zijn er echter nog veel stukken op het bord en is de positie van jouw koning een beetje verzwakt. meer dan eens heb jij aangegeven moeite te hebben met het zien van schaakmat. wat is schaakmat? zoals jij weet kan een koning in tegenstelling tot andere stukken niet genomen worden. zodra een koning wordt aangevallen, is de eigenaar van de koning verplicht ervoor te zorgen dat de koning niet meer wordt aangevallen aan het einde van zijn beurt. schaakmat is de situatie wanneer een speler zijn koning niet meer uit de aanval te halen.  verdedigen tegen schaakmat houdt dus in dat jij ervoor zorgt dat de koning ofwel: - helemaal niet aangevallen kan worden - vluchtvelden heeft waar hij heen kan gaan als hij wordt aangevallen - stukken bij zich in de buurt heeft die een aanvaller kan nemen - stukken bij zich in de buurt heeft die zichzelf tussen de aanvaller en de koning kan plaatsen wit ontwikkelt snel in de hoop dat hij een aanval tegen jouw koning kan organiseren. dit is waarschijnlijk zijn beste zet of in ieder geval zijn beste hoop. ? de diagonaal tussen h5 en e8 is erg gevaarlijk wanneer deze open is, omdat er geen stukken zijn die zich hier tussen kan plaatsen. als wit dus over deze diagonaal aanvalt, moet de koning wel vluchten, want er is geen stuk die hem kan helpen. een ander probleem is dat na deze zet de zwarte loper (a1) niet meer goed kan meehelpen met de verdediging.  je had jouw loper terug moeten halen naar f6. natuurlijk de juiste zet. ! op f8 zou de zwarte koning nog minder vluchtvelden hebben en zou loper naar c4 waarschijnlijk dodelijk zijn geweest.  de loper geeft de witte dame ondersteuning bij het aanvallen van de koning. de dame dreigt nu binnen te komen op f7. de zwarte koning heeft dan maar één vluchtveld over en zal worden opgejaagd tot de mat erop volgt. aangezien de koning zichzelf niet kan verdedigen moet zwart er snel voor zorgen dat zijn stukken de koning kan helpen met verdedigen. ? vermoedelijk de verliezende fout. het was noodzakelijk om met dwang er stukken bij te halen die mee kunnen helpen met de verdediging. beste en wellicht enigste zet was pion van d7 naar d5. het valt de loper aan en onderbreekt de ondersteuning van deze loper zodat wit zijn dame niet naar f7 kan spelen. na de pionzet zou wit de pion waarschijnlijk nemen met zijn loper waarna de dreiging (dh5 - f7+) zich herhaalt. echter, met de pion uit de weg kan jouw andere loper zich bij de verdediging gaan bemoeien (loper c8 - e6), waarna zwart goede kansen moet hebben de aanval af te slaan. dame naar f7 was de grootste dreiging, maar wit kan dat straks alsnog spelen. ? hierna is het direct mat, maar ook na koning e8-e7, dame h5-f7+, koning e7-d6 lijkt de zwarte koning moeilijk te verdedigen

"best by test" bobby fisher ¿the berlin? 4.-...nxe4 5.-d4 nd6 6.-bxc6 dxc6 7.-dxe5 nf5 8.-qxd8 kxd8 its the so called berlin defense; a variation long time favorite of kramink. when playing bc5 in the spanish its preferible to delay castle in order of playing d6, so may the usual bg5 move may have no effect due to h6 and g5, and black's king has not yet castle and may go to the queenside. black its lost, altough bb6, 8.-e5 ne8 9.-d5 nb8 would be lost too, but less lost. ng4 its more of the same medicine. a piece up white simplifies to an easy ending exchanges pieces keeps exchanging and obtains the seventh rank 23.-...rfe8 was required. allows white a forced mate in 3. the only move was rg8

here's a game i played in the first round of the casual section in the 35th tournament. i already had four points, and my opponent had two wins and no losses. so this game decided who passed to the next round, and it has a lot of pressure. i started with this common move. the french defense. it requires a long and precise defense... if black doesn't play accurately, white will soon have the initiative. white tries to claim the center. ?? a bad move and an outright loss of tempo. blunder. ? a prophilactic move,since it prevents ng5, but with no sense of opportunity. black should develop his pieces first. (?) the " italian" development of the bishop. i later realized this was a bad square for the clerk. ! white necessarily loses tempo. this opening principle is valid in this situation : one should develop knights before bishops. this move would have lost his power with nc3. ? a move that weakens black's kingside and stops ... 0-0 . natural. the knight is now pinned. another  piece gets pinned. ? ? white doesn't want a minority attack on his rock. notice that this move is possible because black's kingside is full of holes. ?? it would have been better rg8, to defend the g-pawn. the multiple pins start to pay off, because black can't capture with ... nxg6. !! a grand move. the second pin pays dividends, because black can't recapture the knight with his own knight and won't trade his queen for the rook and the knight. !! the move that forces the queen to be traded for one rook. !! the other option was bh8 !! and now, the coup de grâce. checkmate.

this was a very interesting game. i held my highly rated opponent for most of the game, but missed the best move after all the complications seemed to have passed and i lost quickly after that. my usual reply. the most common move. heading towards grünfeld defence positions. i was half expecting him to play this at some point, as i had seen he plays the catalan against the queen's gambit declined. so i just continue. he is now threatening e2-e4. i could just allow it and go into king's indian defence structures, but i decide to stay true to the grünfeld defence. systems in which white delays the development of his queen's knight to c3 are known as the neo-grünfeld defence, such as this. he takes, as in the main line systems in the grünfeld defence  i take back. i was expecting 6. e4 now. this is actually more common. i strike at his centre. and now he does attack my knight. rather than meekly retreat i decide to advance. we are already out of the books - retreats to b6 or c7 have been played before. fritz prefers a3. striking at the white centre before he can consolidate. fritz likes this move. he now hits my knight once again, instead of retreating, i counter-attack. he takes. i take. he takes back with his queen, preventing immediate castling. i take the pawn. he castles. in return for the pawn he has better development and better pawn structure. chances are roughly level. with the options of going to f6 or e5. the logical way of developing his rook. the pin on the e file could be useful. i attack his queen. he threatens my pawn and d5-d6 could be a powerful discovery at some stage.  i protect the pawn on b4. fritz prefers bf5 with equality. he attacks my knight. the knight is heading for the fine blockading square on d6. he develops his knight. i finally castle. his knight moves up the board. i blockade his isolated d pawn with my knight - the best blockading piece. the logical square to put his a rook, along the open file. at last this bishop comes out. the knight hops in. i did see some of the following complications. i did see he could exchange on d6 and then win the b pawn, but i thought his knight was then trapped on b7. he takes. i take back. indeed his knight is trapped if he takes on b7, but he comes in here, forking queen and rook. so i take. he takes back. and i block the advance of his e pawn. and he gets his pawn back. now of course, if i take the bishop he has e7+ winning rook for pawn. i take his rook. he takes back. and i follow suit! but he has this! more or less forced! now the black king is forced onto a black square where the bb2 can be taken with check. as good as anywhere! takes with check. if now rf6? 28. pe8=n+! now the best defence for black is qc3 and i am still in the game. now it is hopeless. funny how such a simple, obvious move can be such a mistake. gaining a tempo. so i take the pawn. a nasty check. i could have just retreated the king to d8. but i played this. i was looking at now 30. bxf7 threatening a discovery with his bishop and if 30...kd8 then 31. qf8 mates. however 30...kd8 is not forced and he hasn't really got any wonderful discovered checks. so this is just as good. forced! another check, two more pawns are going. nothing better first pawn goes. king drops back. second pawn drops. i will just add the final moves without further comment. and black finally resigns. thank you for reading. please leave a comment or two and rate this annotation on the star system. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
i was a few minutes late for the start. i play my usual. i paused here and eventually played. this white gradually steers the game into a mainline grünfeld defence. i continue to develop. white threatens e2-e4. so i switch it to a grünfeld defence. and he opts for the exchange variation. i was rather expecting 5. qb3 russian system as white has already played nf3. it is generally thought that an early nf3 was weak in the exchange variation because it allowed black too much pressure on the centre with ...bg4.  i take back. he seizes the centre. i exchange. he takes back. i castle. this is rather unusual with nf3.  in the late 1970s karpov, kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange variation with white, with nf3, often involving an early rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of black's queenside. another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing be3, qd2, and rc1 or rd1 to fortify white's centre, remove white's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by white. i hit the centre. he prevents the pin by ....bg4, but at the cost of losing a valuable tempo. i hit d4 again. i'm now attacking it 4 times, with pawn, knight, bishop and queen. he is only protecting it 3 times. so he protects d4 again. i take. he takes back. i throw in a check. he interposes his queen. i take. he has to take back with the king, as taking with knight or bishop loses his d pawn. i attack the d pawn again. if kd3 then i can win a pawn by taking on d4 followed by e7-e5, so he only has one move. this has all been seen before, na5	was played in seitler, andrej (2064) vs. stefan, oldrich (2067) bd7 was played in colomer guart, … (2205) vs. brunet martinez… (2235) b6 was played in asfora, marco a… (2271) vs. toth, christian… (2344). all games were won by black.  i attack the bishop.  15.	be2	was played in seitler, andrej (2064) vs. stefan, oldrich (2067) i thought that his bishop was better than my knight. this is the best way to recapture, opening up the a file for him, and protecting the c4 square. i now had a long think. i like this move. if he protects the pawn with 17. nd2 or 17. ng5 then f4 wins for me. if 17. kd3 then e7-e5 is strong. if he takes, my bishop takes back with gain of time. that leaves only one move for him. this. but now his d pawn is backward. he finally develops his rh1. i get ready to move my ra8. he threatens to invade on c7. so i contest control of the c file. he takes. i take back. he contests the c file. i take. he takes back. i think this ending is very comfortable for me. his d pawn is backward. i have a queen-side pawn majority. he has a plan to unravel his king-side.  i make it harder for him to enforce d4-d5 this frees the knight from protecting his king-side pawns. and this frees my bishop from protecting the e6 pawn. he threatens nc5. which i prevent. he brings his king up. i move my bishop to a more useful square. threatening bd8 and an attack on b6. so i stop that. he takes. i take back. he attacks d5 and a6. so this is forced. the knight has done its work on b4. i was rather afraid of it going to e3 now. so i stop that, also anchoring his g and f pawns on white squares, where they can be attacked by my bishop.  the knight is coming round to c4 now. i had a long think here. i was originally going to play kd7 32.	nc4 kc7 but then he has 33. nd6 and the knight has reached a great square! bd5 32. nc4 bxc4 33. bxc4 is a drawn king and pawn ending. b6-c5 allows the white king in on the black squares - 32. kb4 kd7 33. kc5 kc7. we looked at this position together afterwards. black can still draw it, but has to be careful, white has a slight advantage. what would you play as black in the position dear reader?   i plan to sacrifice the b pawn! attacking the b pawn. this is the point! if he takes the b pawn, my bishop goes to f1 and i start taking his king-side pawns. this is best, taking one of his pawns off a white square. i have to take the knight now, for instance, if i try h6 34. nxb6 bf1 35. kd2 bxg2 36. ke2 and white is winning - his knight can return to c4 and then take my a pawn. so i take. he takes back. i offer a draw, which was declined. trying a queen-side pentration with his king. this is easily stopped. he mobilises his central pawn majority. i take. he takes back. i push my b pawn. and finally drawn on white's offer.   many thanks for reading. please rate my annotation on the star system, and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader!

 mis partidas, mas que analisis teoricos estrictos, pretenden mostrar como voy abordando desde el punto de vista conceptual, los planes y estrategias a seguir basados en la posicion en que me encuentro. ahora voy por algo mas novedoso, pensando en que el puntaje de mi oponente me daba una ventaja facil de aprovechar. que error!!! la defensa alekhine. me parecio raro que no tomara el peon ofrecido. no quise arriesgarme y... ...opte por algo mas normal, la giouco piano que conozco mejor despues de participar en un minitorneo al respecto :-) pianisimo ahora veremos que sigue imagine que para jugar c3. aqui ya me quedaba claro que el puntaje a veces es engañoso. obvio. torres conectadas, fin del desarrollo. en algun libro lei eso. comienza el medio juego lo esperado. tipico de la apertura italiana mejor era cambiar peones, como se ve a continuacion. mejor era bxc6, ahora pierdo material... es claro que el blanco ahora se enfocara en el caballo y su captura, esto me permite adoptar el plan para esta partida. teniendo el par de alfiles y el negro apuntado a f2, atacar el lado contrario aprovechando la distraccion que significa la captura del caballo.  aqui podria haber hecho cxb3, recuperando un peon de los perdidos, cxe4 recupero el otro y atacar la columna b para obtener ventaja, pero no era consecuente con mi plan, es decir, que el caballo fuera el objetivo del blanco, despreocupandose de la posicion y mi ataque. por eso, me enfoco al punto f2. el caballo seria una amenaza para mi alfil de casillas negras retrasando la captura del peon e4 para que el blanco tenga tiempo de "preocuparse" por el, y con ello, alejar la torre de f2. bingo!!!. 
-------------------------------------
 es cierto que mis planes son muy simples, pero la practica me ha indicado que generalmente estoy en lo cierto :-) y funcionan en este nivel de manejo del juego. al ataque. ya esta cumplido el primer objetivo. el blanco sigue empeñado en capturar el caballo de a8 y descuida completamente el critico f2 la ultima pieza necesaria para el mate entra en accion el mate se acerca esta jugada esta demas, aunque gana claramente por la diferencia de material, el fin de dar mate al rey no se cumple. esto es basicamente porque aun no veia como. volvemos a la posicion inicial. ahora ya me habia dado cuenta como hacerlo. la jugada clave que no vi en la posicion anterior. ahora si 26.- gxh3, df2+ y mate en h2.
-------------------------------------
 una buena partida para aprender de los errores, no tan traumaticamente. este ataque es algo apresurado como se demuestra posteriormente. para eliminar el molesto caballo de f5, pero... esta no la vi, el caballo se instala en el comedor de la casa. aqui ya me vi en problemas, aunque el blanco todavia no tiene un ataque definitivo, la siguientes dos jugadas son pensando en el enroque que venia del blanco, a apoyar a su dama... claro para minimizar el daño de td1. quiza era mejor b3 para darle vuelo a su alfil por a3 apoyando la accion de la dama. creo que esta movida fue un error pues resto potencia al ataque blanco y perdio un tiempo.
-------------------------------------
quite an interesting game from the tournament i most recently participated in, ending in my first victory against a 1700+ rated player. in this game i had the black pieces. four knights opening (so named for fairly obvious reasons). this tends to lead to fairly quiet play. the most common move at higher levels. beginners often play 4. bc4 but this can be answered by 4... nxe4! leading to a good position for black. this is rubinstein's variation, more aggressive than the symmetrical 4... bb4. note that white cannot win a pawn by 5. nxe5 as black regains it after 5... qe7. less common than 5. ba4 or 5. nxd4. note that 5... nxe4 is less good now with e5 undefended; one possible continuation is the wild 6. bxf7+ kxf7 7. nxe5+ and now watch what happens if black gets too greedy: 7... ke6 8. nxe4 kxe5 9. qh5+ kxe4 10. d3#!! trying to head back into quieter waters. black is a tempo up after white's bb5-c4. the database gives 6. nxe5 as the most common here; this leads to 6... qe7 7. nxf7 rf8 8. ng5 d5 9. be2 dxe4 with an unclear position. a sensible precaution to stop bg4, which would be very good for black with the knight on d4. the database gives this as the first unique move; 8... nxf3+ was played in raedwald vs. ronaldwilson (0-1 in only 16 moves, but white blundered allowing a knight fork, so the win does not say much about 8... nxf3+ in particular). i suppose i was just consolidating my centre, but it turns out to be a mistake, since... ...i have to advance the pawn again, losing a tempo. even if i didn't want to play 8... nxf3+, i could have spent my eighth move on a developing move such as bd7 or be6. white decides to exchange one of my doubled pawns. on paper that sounds like a good deal, but it's likely to be followed by a further exchange on d4, leaving my d6 pawn isolated and vulnerable. still, i have no choice but to accept. preparing to support the advance of the pawns to b5 and c4. if white responds with d4, the d-file remains blocked. challenging one defender of b5 and also opening the line for my queen to guard the rook, so that if white exchanges bishops i can play 16... b5 without the a-pawn being pinned. we both defend our bishops, each waiting to see who's going to exchange first. white exchanged. it's time to advance, and see if i can get something out of my queenside majority. preparing to advance on the side where white has the majority, i assume. this move, unpinning the e6 pawn, is necessary before i can advance further. white challenges my inadequately defended b5 pawn. the response is obvious. freeing the knight from having to defend the h3 pawn. if instead 24. cxb4 i was planning to take with the rook. at some point very close to this – i don't remember exactly which move – i offered a draw, having accidentally timed out two games (my first ever) that meant i couldn't progress in the tournament, and wanting to limit the damage. i thought the position was fairly drawish, too, with material level and white's active pieces consistently limiting my plans, but white decided to play on. i had expected 25. dxc4, getting white's pawn off a file my heavy pieces can use. of course, it would also block the file for white to attack my d-pawn, and perhaps white felt that was more important. the rook has no obvious targets on the e-file. perhaps 26. rfc1 was better. i see nothing better than exchanging, since the rook cannot stay put, and no other rank offers an active position. the draw offer has changed the game psychologically, since i feel white's most likely reasoning for declining was that he felt he could win, and that automatically puts me on the defensive. i know that my position looks fairly good, with the passed pawn, but the downside is that my pawn majority is under constant threat while white's is still quietly at home. my turn to offer an exchange: again with the motivation being whittling down whatever chances white may have of converting this into a win. a dangerous move, since it threatens immediate checkmate. for a moment i wondered if 29... re8 had been a blunder. black does, however, have this defence. now 32. qf8 is not mate because of ng8. if white plays 32. nh5 to threaten mate on g7, either 32... qd7 or 32... qd5+ defends, the latter also forcing the exchange of queens. this move instead combines the threat on g7 with attacking c5. in addition, qd5+ no longer forces the exchange of queens. black must therefore use his other defence: and now white is up a pawn. a good counterattacking response. black threatens to make something of his passed pawn, and white's queen is temporarily immobilised through having to defend the knight. white decides to sacrifice knight for pawn. i don't know if this was necessary, since 36. na4 qxd3 (qb7 37. qa3) 37. qb8 seems adequate to keep the pawn in check. black would at least have regained the lost pawn, with a draw looking likely. obvious; white must hold onto his own passed pawn to retain winning chances. and black must mobilise the knight. white can't continue pushing the pawn: 39. d5 nf6 40. d6 qd1+ 41. kg2 ne4 42. d7 nf6. i'm not sure what white's specific plan was with the move played; perhaps trying to get his queen behind the pawn. but black can occupy the d-file first. white had no way of preventing this. in hindsight, i think this was a blunder. i wanted the queens off so my king could play a more active role, but i could and should have played 41... kg6 first since white has no immediate good checks. exchanging with white's king closer to the centre than mine is too risky, since the lone knight is not the best piece at defending against passed pawns. and here white returns the favour; 43. kf3 might even win. i've looked at a couple of lines and it seems black will have to give the knight for the pawn, for instance 43. kf3 nd6 44. kf4 kg6 45. ke5 nc4+ 46. ke6. now it's less good, both because black's king is better-placed to hold white's back, and because white's own f-pawn takes up a vital square. black must, however, be careful not to fall into the trap of 44... kf5?? 45. g4+. white isn't just marking time; he's preparing to knock my knight so his king can reach e4. (!) but this defence turns the tables. zugzwang. no white pawn can advance, and any king move allows kd5. white's best shot. of course there's a trap, 50... nxg6?? 51. f5+, but more to the point is that taking with the king gives white time to advance the pawn further. not best; 52. d6 would have set black more problems, but 52... nc6 53. kd5 nd8 is adequate to stop the pawn. after the move played... ...black can just gobble the pawn, simplifying to a winning pawn endgame. if 53. kxd5 then 53... kf5 and the pawn cannot be saved. this is the simplest winning procedure: white's king is kept away from the g-file. now white wonders if black will repeat the position. no; white's king can come to the g-file now, the pawn will cross the last danger square (g4) before white's king can challenge it there. white resigned. mendez is now the highest-rated player i have won against, but he also beat me in our other game in the same tournament. 
-------------------------------------
my first anotated game i like playing the french a lot, i have very good results with it. the advanced variation. against this particular variation i like playing against, i think that black has very good play by putting pressure in the center with c5, nc3, ne7-f5, qb6, and so on,  having an equilibriated game and a very good initiative. the typical french pawn structure the literature recommends here to play c3, defending directly d4 with a pawn, making a more solid structure. adding some more pressure to d4 ?! inaccuracy. i think c3 was better. be3 doesn´t defend d4 well. with the intention of playing nf4 adding more pressure on d4 and threatening nxe3 ?! again, c3 was better. his center is going to fall soon. ?? i can´t figure out what was the plan of the guy at that moment. that move is bad because the knight has to go back after a6. he had to develop his pieces instead. ?? solving the check the guy lost a pawn but i don´t know why. maybe because he was trying to relieve the pressure on the center, and then equalizing by 10. dxc5, thinking that i couldn´t take the pawn because it was protected by the bishop. but instead he will be punished. removing the defender. another line is 11. cxd6 nxd1 12. rxd1 kd7, the black pawn structure is pretty stable and the white passed pawn is hopeless.  winning the pawn with the intention of castle long controlling the center, and preparing the white squared bishop to enter the action. developing. here i was doubting if he was castling short or long. safeguarding the king ? i think castling short was a better option, because of the potential threats bf5, rc8 and nb4 pressuring c2 bringing the bishop into combat. there it controls the h7-b1 diagonal and pinning the pawn, looking for a further combination.   ? bad plan. he maybe wanted to control the b4 square preventing the knight jump and later to do b5 to expel the queen. be he wasn´t paying attention to the multiple threats coming. putting more pressure on the column and preparing na6-b3 with a double check threatening the double check  nb3+ that would be unstoppable because of the double pin on the pawn, losing the queen ? i think this is bad. i don´t know what he was thinking. if he wanted an exchange of queens, white king will be totally exposed after the exchange, and will lose another pawn. but here i saw something else. i thought for a very long time. i saw a combination but i wasn´t pretty sure about what was going to happen. finally i decided to do it... ! the next combination is forced. forced. if 18. kb1 rxc3 only legal move and here i recover the queen. i had a problem of calculation here, i was expecting 20.gxf5 rxe3 with 3 pawns of advantage and threatening the knight. instead i will have only 2 pawns of advantage, but it´s also pretty good. fork! here i accepted the trade of knights because i was going to have a very strong passed pawn in exchange. and he resigned here, because the pawn is almost unstoppable.

-------------------------------------
i opened with the sicilian defense. as i use to against 1.e4. by the way, this game was played through e-mail, at the fully automated e-mail chess site e4ec. i started playing a little a year ago by e-mail because i wanted training for my iccf correspondence chess tournaments! have continued to do so, of course it´s easier to play on a server, but it´s kinda fun with e-mail too. one thing you must been alert on, is that nearly every single e-mail chess site has it´s own specific rules, for example time controls and allowing/ not allowing external help as game databases, computer analysis can be much different from site to site. this site, e4ec, are not allowing any help at all, not even opening explorer! i planning fianchetto at g7. ???? bad move! allows a pawn fork against white´s bishop at c4 and knight at a4. now i get a free pawn too! and an open b-file! back is safest! castling. probably it would be the best move also for white to castle in the next move? aiming at pawn f7. threatening the knight at c5, but also will also win rook a2 in the next move, if white plays wrong here. the best defense move. kinda tricky. if white takes my knight with his knight at b3, i will win white´s rook a2 with check! also threatening white´s queen!  counter-threat! white is threatening mate in one at h7 in next move! a defense move is a must! h6. pretty simple. ??? bad move. are blocking white queen from protecting the b3-square, which will lead to tactics and white rook-loss.  now rook a2 is lost! castling, but white has already lost to much material! it´s not getting better for white now. a counter-attack against black´s king begins to develop. and there comes the knight! kinda worrying attack against my king! the only move. a fork. saves the day for black´s rook. trying to force exchange. because of black´s huge material advantage it´s a good idea! trying to continue the attack. but now has black good defenders of his king. centralizing the queen with check and tempo gain. all pieces must be activated. i´m slowly improving my position. threatening white´s queen and also aiming at white´s pawn at g2. now can white take black´s bishop. but it´s not really a good idea! white´s rook is pinned! white gave up!  
-------------------------------------
excited to play in my first gk tourney, i start out ambitiously. !?? i was trying to make a reasonable move that was not in the db, but next time i think i'll just steer the game into more familiar lines. this should be playable, but pressure on d5 and b7 make it dangerous for black. …bg4, …e6, …nc6 and …qb6 are all natural and good. ! the most challenging. ? this move is sufficient in many analogous positions, but here c5 is undefended. …qc8 is not very exciting, but it seems best. ! winning a pawn and forcing off the queens at the same time. black is down a clear pawn, with little prospect of ever getting it back. whites two pairs of doubled pawns give some drawing hopes, however, and there is quite a bit of play left in the game. …nbd7 would force b4 right away and allow me to play …e5, but the knight would then have nowhere to go. ?! this is not yet necessary. with 8. nf3, white develops, stops …e5, and reserves b4 for when black has committed himself by …e6. this impressive center is a lot less potent without a queen to provide attacking chances. white is clearly better, and black is fighting to draw. 11. …e5 12. nd4 held no interest for me. now my knight is passive, but i clear f6 for the bishop. adding more pressure to e5. ?! an odd move. 14. rfe1 ∆ e4 is more to the point. ! this move would have more force with the knight on f3 and the rook on e1, but it is still an excellent way to break up black's center. black must make the bishop choose before clarifying the center. 15. …d4 16. bxc6 bxc6 17. cxd4 exd4 18. nf3 rounds up the d-pawn, while 15. …dxe4 16. nxe4 be7 17. nd6 is no fun. forcing a trade. at least black will get the d-file. ! tightening white's grip. anticipating nd6. ! and bye-bye d-file. 21. nd6 rxe1 22. rxe1 rd7 would be even better, but white still has everything under control. ! ejecting the rook. now …re2 is tempting, with the threat of …re4, but nf3 leaves the rook dangerously short of squares. ! and more exchanges. note at this point that, though white has perhaps not played with 100% accuracy, he has skillfully eliminated all of black's best cheapo drawing tactics. there will be no rook endgames, no bishops of opposite colors, and there are still plenty of pawns on both sides of the board. black now wants to try and advance the kingside pawns, hoping first of all to exchange off as many pawns as possible and second of all to possibly get a passer of his own. at the same time, he needs to keep the queenside pawns blockaded and deal with the threatened intrusion on d6. !? a clever way to activate the knight. nd6 right away is fine, too. aiming twice for d6. the only way to break white's vicegrip on the position also trades off a set of doubled pawns. so now we see the character of this endgame: white has 3-vs-1 on the queenside, but his pawns are doubled and awkward to get moving. black has 4-vs-3 on the kingside but has a hard time making much of it and will have to do a lot of defending. the further advanced the pawns are, the more likely black can tie white pieces down to the kingside. ! making way for the b-pawn's advance.  !? i thought this was very clever at the time, but white retains all of his advantage with precise play. perhaps …bd6 was better, holding the pawns due to 40. b4 bxa3 41. bxa3 (bxc6? bxb2 and now black is even better) axb3 = the black b-pawn holds back both its white counterparts. after 39. …bd6 white can play nc2 with the idea of supporting the lead b-pawn with either be1 or bc4, and then playing c4. the point – black gets his pawn back, but nothing more. ! trying to hold onto the pawn is no good: 41. ke2 ng4+ 42. ke2 (kf3? fxe4+) nxf2 43. exf5+ kxf5 44. kxf2 bxh2 45. g3 h4 and black's pawns are just as dangerous as white's, while the bishop is obviously superior to the knight. or, 41. kd4?? bb6# ! otherwise either …ng4 or …nd6 will win a pawn for real. ! white has kept everything together and will slowly drive black back. first, the threat of g3 provokes a concession. black has managed to exchange some pawns and even create a passed pawn on e4, but the kingside pawns are now firmly blockaded and the initiative passes to white. ! without further ado. ! the black king is short of squares. waste of time, but no damage done. organizing a further advance. aiming for a blockade on the dark squares. ? this bishop will just get forced back. ! after bxc5 kxc5, progress is more difficult. ! going for black's best bet, occupying b4. still should be insufficient. !? a sharp line that shows that gives black no time for …kb4. on the other hand, the connected passed pawns now begin to get separated and harder to defend.  ng5, simply going after the e-pawn, also deserved consideration. ? in hindsight, though this move looks scary, i think it is the reason black could escape with a draw. the pawn now gets too advanced and, although black must play extremely carefully, it is eventually lost. 60. bd2+ kb5 (nb4? 61. c6! and black loses a piece) 61. b4!? with the idea of 61. …nxb4? 62. bxb4 kxb4 63. c6! and stopping the pawn will cost a bishop. if black can find a way to hold against this line, however, then perhaps we must go even further back to find a win for white.   forced, or else the pawn goes through. ! and now, white switches the attack to black's advanced, neglected kingside pawns. 61. c7 kb7 is pointless, of course. at least i can force a b-for-n trade and then win the c-pawn, but e5 is doomed and g5 is not far behind. 63. …kb3 loses to nf6 64. g3? nd5+ ? going after my last pawn. it was more challenging to play kd3, though, and focus on shepherding home the remaining queenside pawn. this would be similar to the actual game continuation, except that there would be an extra pair of pawns on the board to increase the winning chances. i almost resigned instead of playing this move. thank goodness i didn't! it is so easy to miss all the multitude of resources which are hidden in seemingly terrible positions. here, even (temporarily) two pawns down in a simplified endgame, it seems that black can draw no matter what white does! at this point, i thought that white had just thrown the game away. i wrote: "68. ne4! is the key, refusing to abandon the b-pawn so easily. 68. ne4 kb4 69. nd2 bc3 70. ke2 and if black trades pieces and wins the b-pawn, then the g-pawn queens. otherwise, white will bring the king around to c2, switch the knight to the kingside, and black cannot stop both pawns." thanks to nuntar's input, i now realize that 69. …kc3! should hold here. therefore, we have to look earlier for where white could have saved the win. ! plenty of other bishop moves are good, but the exclam is for instructive value: this move goes to the heart of the position. to win, white needs to get the g-pawn to g8 without ever allowing black to sac the bishop for it. as long as the bishop stays on the h8-a1 diagonal, the only way to prevent that sac is by blocking the diagonal with nf6. thus, black puts the bishop "inside" f6 so that white cannot block the bishop without first ejecting it from h8. to do this, the white king must go to h7 or g8, where it no longer can support a knight on f6. since the white king cannot control h8 and f6 at once, white will need to bring up the pawn to support f6. that will give the black king time to get back and control f6 himself, after which the bishop cannot be blocked at all. the king hurries back to help control f6, after which the draw is assured for the reasons already stated at move 69. !? tricksy! white has found a new way to deal with the bishop: he threatens nf6 first, and then kh7, forcing a trade into a won king and pawn endgame. unfortunately for white, however, black will simply retreat his bishop for just long enough for the king to arrive and help out. ! nf6 is now met with ke3 and the pawn is tied to the defense of the knight. ! it doesn't matter that the king blocks the bishop temporarily. black threatens to install the king on f4, forcing g3 and keeping the knight of f6 forever. otherwise we just repeat moves. 76. g6? bxf6 is no help, of course. and white, seeing that there is no way to advance further, offered a draw. a very lucky escape against the top seed in my tournament group! at the same time, it teaches us to keep struggling as long as there are any chances left at all. 
-------------------------------------
quise empezar con una apertura inglesa, aunque la posición resultante bien se parece a una india de rey, con la única diferencia del peón en g5 la idea es que si cg4 axg5 esta es la posición el tipo de posición que buscaba, el negro se encuentra retrasado en desarrollo y su rey en el centro, tengo la posibilidad de abrir columnas tras e5, y mi torre en h1 no estaba jugando, desconozco si el sacrificio que sigue puede ser o no bueno, pero al menos resulta interesante cambiando el alfil más activo probablemente este golpe haya sido omitido por mi adversario obviamente, esto es mejor que comer el peón este caballo debe caer en e6, solo debe abrirse camino

-------------------------------------
an experiment i've tried a few times.  after this game, not planning to repeat.  the d5 square is just too weak.  exclam.  keeping the bishop in order to exploit black's weak white squares.  the most common move, 7. bxd7, trades if off for no good reason.  white's advantage is also clear after 8… nc5 9. bd5  both 12… be7 and 12… bg7 can be answered by 13. ng4, after which black has big problems.  exclam.  i had only considered 14. ncd5 nbd5 15. nd5 nd5 16. ed5 a5, where black has hope of consolidating.  if 14… nbd7 15. ncd5 and black will lose the b-pawn for starters.  after 15… be4 16. ba4 or 15… cxb2 16. ba4, black's king is trapped in the center.  possibly not urgent.  17. rd1 might have killed me faster.  17… nxe4 18. na5 qb6 19. qd3 (threatening 20. nxb7 and 21. bd5) nf6 20. qg6+.  ouch.  19… qc8 20. nd6 was not very appetizing.    here i thought i had almost achieved a playable position.  i was proven mistaken.  exclam.  nothing matters except the b-pawn.  it's over.  the rest is momentum.   
-------------------------------------
so far a conventional king's indian defence, sämisch variation. playable, but simply 0-0 is better. so i continue with the normal development. he hits at the centre. i take extra space. i think the pawn sacrifice, nd4 is much better. if white takes twice in d4, in return for the pawn, black gets rid of white's powerful black squared bishop. chances would be even. white continues developing. i think this is a slight inaccuracy too. simply 0-0 looks better. now black has to watch out for white playing d5xc6 and leaving balck with a weak d6 pawn. white maybe prepared 0-0-0 and/or be3-h6. black prevents be3-h6 but at the cost of meaning that he can't play 0-0 without losing his h6 pawn. 0-0 looks better. so i continue to develop. maybe preparing b7-b5 at some stage. i am preparing an attack on the king side. i am intending leaving my king in the centre. this closes up the centre, and prevents me from playing d5xc6. but it comes at a cost. by playing c7-c6-c5 he has wasted a move, and made it harder to open up the queen side. now that i have advanced my g pawn, i can put my knight behind it, as part of the general build up on the king side. he seems to be preparing b7-b5 again. i connect my rooks, so that they can join the action in whichever side they are needed.  he is threatening b7-b5 now so i stop it. and he prevents a4-a5, and leaving him a weak square on b6. now a4-a5 can be answered by b6-b5! so i threaten to open up the queen side with b2-b4.  and he stops it. the only problem for him is now the queen side is just completely closed. there is no chance of opening lines there, and he just has to wait for my king side attack. i am threatening g4-g5 now, opening up the king side. this is an attempt to keep the king side closed. g5 will be answered by h5 and h5 answered by g5. the problem is after 17. g5 h5 i can still prepare f3-f4 opening up the king side. so i play it.  and he tries to block things up again. his problem is that he now has a completely passive position and must just try to defend. i decided that his best piece is his bd7, and my worst was my bd3, so the idea is to route it to h3 and exchange bishops. i was expecting qc8 in defence. i was going to continue with nc3-b5 attacking d6. he would be forced to exchange on b5 and them by bishop can reach h3 with tempo. qc8 is no better or worse than the game continuation. his knight is going to a7 to prevent my knight coming in to b5. the problem is on a7 his knight is rather away from the king side when things hot up there. so i prepare to exchange light squared bishops.  he covers b5. i intend to move my king and play f3-f4. if his bd7 would be still left on the board, f3-f4 is well met by bd7-g4 and his bg4 becomes a nuisance. this is another reason why i want the bd7 out of the way. as played, f3-f4 in fact more important in opening up the d1-h5 diagonal, rather than the f file. so he takes - they were coming off anyway. i take back. he hits the rook. i retreat. preparing a rather belated 0-0. i want to release my nc3 to bring over to the king side. first i must give protection to my a pawn. so he castles, but there are dangers of a sacrifice on h5. my knight comes over, as planned. the rook on b8 wasn't doing much. now it has potential use on the e file. preparing the f3-f4 break. this knight no longer has to watch for nc3-b5, but it is still a bit out of play. so here it comes! he takes. i take back. his bishop finds a better square. i am now threatening a sacrifice on h5. trying to get a ook to h8 to defend. but i get in first. he takes. i take back. there is no good defence. his king retreats. i attack his queen. i am also threatening q-h5 with a mating attack. so he removes the knight, but now the g pawn reches f6 and helps the mate. i throw in a check. king moves. the end is near. there is nothing better. and black resigns. many thanks for reading this. please leave a comment, and rate it on the "star" system. 
-------------------------------------
interesting and new but... good? even more original and even more questionable.  not even leaves the black diag to the queen, in sight the bishop is out of the defence.  why not? blocking his own good diagonal.  bxb, nxb and nb4... a well known pattern.  the key point is b4, so i protect it by defending solidly. this opens the white squares to the queen, and the knight in c3 blocked my own pawn.  again, original. but i won't lose my temper.  voilà, and expansion free of charge on the queenside.  finally, and almost forced (the retreat was hummilliant).  i decided not to care for the attack.  still nothing dangerous.  the best square, since i want to go f4.  wonderful... so what? which kind of attack is black planning on the queenside? contact! i couldn't ask a better move, since... now, f6 was obvious, but cutted the black queen out of the action.  ? premature. i was sure i had a mate net, but i was wrong.  ...and nohing. true the material is even, and black minor pieces are useless on the queenside. what else do i have? threatening ng5. isn't it obvious? ? can you believe? ? i should have played nf3 before, and it would have been deadly.  +2, and a threatened rook, plus a mate threat.  i'll lose c3, but... my position is not so terrible.  black wants to make use of his dead pieces now that the storm on the black king has fainted.  ! i like this move, it prepares a complete refutation of black's attack.  never defend if you can safely attack something bigger... idem... but now the bishop is trapped, and is dead lost. ba1, ra2. here my opponent abandonded the game.  
-------------------------------------
the most recent game between my friend jo and myself was instructive and worth annotating. jo started with a bird's opening.  white's strategy is to dominate the kingside. black responds with the sharp reply 1...e5!?, from's gambit, named for the danish chess player martin severin from (1828–1895), thus sacrificing a pawn to exploit white's weakened kingside before white can develop adequately. besides taking the pawn, white can play the safer e4, transposing into a kings gambit with equal chances.  a more obscure, modern move order. the idea is to defer ...d6 and develop instead, hoping to transpose to better variations. after the normal 2...d6 3.exd6 bxd6, white must play 4.nf3, avoiding 4.nc3?? qh4+ 5.g3 qxg3+ 5.hxg3 bxg3 checkmate. black has two main alternatives: 4...g5 to drive away white's knight, and 4...nf6, threatening 5...ng4 and 6...nxh2! emanuel lasker introduced 4...g5 in the game bird–lasker, newcastle on tyne, 1892, so it is known as "lasker's variation". today, current thinking is that 4...g5?! is more dubious; a quiet response considered favorable for white is 5.d4 g4 6.ne5! (6.ng5? leads to a dubious piece sacrifice) bxe5 7.dxe5 qxd1+ 8.kxd1 nc6 9.nc3! be6 (9...nxe5?! 10.bf4 f6 11.nd5 kd8 12.nxf6!) 10.bf4 0-0-0+ 11.ke1 nge7 12.e3 ng6 13.bg5 rdf8 14.bf6 rhg8 15.be2 ngxe5 16.rf1 with a slight plus for white. the sharper 5.g3 g4 6.nh4 also seems favorable for white, after 6...ne7 7.d4 ng6 8.nxg6 hxg6 9.qd3 nc6 (9...rh5 10.bg2; 9...na6 10.c3) 10.c3 (10.nc3? nxd4! 11.qxd4?? bg3+ wins white's queen) bf5 (10...qe7 11.bg2! bd7 12.nd2 0-0-0 13.ne4! favored white in taylor–becerra rivero, minneapolis 2005) 11.e4 qe7 12.bg2 0-0-0 13.be3. at this point, white seems to have an advantage in all lines, although play remains extremely sharp, e.g. 13...rde8 14.nd2; 13...rxh2 14.rxh2 bxg3+ 15.kd1 bxh2 16.exf5! re8 17.fxg6! qxe3 18.qxe3 rxe3 19.gxf7; or 13...bd7 (threatening 13...rxh2!) 14.bf2! logically consistent. but with this move order, probably better is 3.nc3! nxe5 4.e4 intending 5.d4, rather than 3.nf3?!, and then after g5!? or d6!? when black has the kind of position they are playing for.  the gk computer considers this move weak compared with ...d6: (inaccuracy: -0.92 » … g5 4. h3 d6 5. d4 dxe5 6. d5 nb4 7. nc3 g4 8. hxg4 ne7 9. bh6 bxh6 10. rxh6 nbxd5 11. nxd5 qxd5 12. qxd5 nxd5 13. nxe5; best: -0.34 » … d6 4. exd6 bxd6 5. nc3 nf6 6. e3 bg4 7. bc4 o-o 8. o-o ne5 9. be2 qd7 10. nxe5 bxe5 11. bxg4) ?! but this move justifies black's plan.  jo does not like the more passive retreat to g1. the most aggressive response, exploiting the position of white's knight which has to be careful to avoid being trapped. again, black chooses the most aggressive response.  defends d4.  black continues the aggressive play. the n is now threatened. hoping for a q trade and to allow the n to retreat. the gk computer considers this weak compared with d5: (inaccuracy: -0.45 » 8. qd3 qxd3 9. exd3 h6 10. ne4 f5 11. nc5 nf6 12. na3 b6 13. na4 be6 14. bf4 o-o-o 15. nc4 nd5 16. bg3; best: -1.10 » 8. d5 bh6 9. dxc6 bxg5 10. bxg5 qxg5 11. nd2 bxc6 12. ne4 qb5 13. qc2 be6 14. e3 qb6 15. o-o-o qxe3+ 16. kb1) prevents the q trade.  best alternative. black has a slight edge at this point.  ? this move is a serious error, giving a clear, winning advantage to black. the gk computer prefers qd4, which is what i had expected. (mistake: +2.04 » 11. qg3 bd6 12. bf4 qf6 13. nd2 nf3+ 14. ngxf3 bxf4 15. qf2 gxf3 16. nxf3 nh6 17. qd4 qxd4 18. cxd4 o-o-o 19. ne5 ba4 best: +0.77 » 11. qd4 bg7 12. qc5 c6 13. dxc6 qxc6 14. qxc6 bxc6 15. na3 h6 16. nb5 kd7 17. nxf7 nxf7 18. bc4}.  of course. an immediate threat is to win the white q with ...nf3+. also the white n is trapped and can be attacked by pawns. !? i decided to play this move rather than qf6 because i wanted to keep pressure on e4.  jo realizes she is in trouble and attempts to complicate. but this accelerates the loss. better was development, such as nd2 first as the gk computer suggests: (mistake: +1.65 » 13. ne6 qxe4+ 14. be2 qxd5 15. bxe5 qxe5 16. qxe5 fxe5 17. bc4 nf6 18. o-o bxe6 19. bxe6 bc5+ 20. kh1 rf8 21. rf5 bd6; best: -1.02 » 13. nd2 o-o-o 14. ne6 bxe6 15. dxe6 ne7 16. o-o-o qg8 17. qe3 kb8 18. bc4 nxc4 19. nxc4 qxe6 20. nxd6 cxd6) here black has only a pawn advantage but has an overwhelming positional and developmental advantage. ? while this protects the n and prevents black from castling, it really doesn't help and accelerates the loss with what is essentially a spite check. after this blunder, white is truly lost. the gk computer suggests bxe5 instead. (mistake: +4.52 » 15. ng7+ kf8 16. qd4 qf7 17. nd2 kxg7 18. ne4 re8 19. nxd6 cxd6 20. kd1 nc6 21. qxd6 bf5 22. kd2 nge7; best: +1.62 » 15. bxe5 qxe6 16. bd4 qxe3+ 17. bxe3 ne7 18. nd2 nf5 19. bf2 g3 20. hxg3 nxg3 21. rh4 nxf1 22. re4+ be5 23. nxf1) now the white n is en prise, the white k and q are on the same file, and white is hopelessly behind in development. but the gk computer considers this an error in that kf8 would have been even stronger.

a number of book lines are available here: [2. ...d5 3. exd5 qxd5 4. d4] [2. ...nf6 3. e5 nd5 4. d4 cxd4 5. cxd4] [2. ...e5 3. nf3 nc6 4. bc4] with 3. d4, white leaves the book already! the post-game computer analysis didn't like the move 4. cxd4 with the score dropping from +0.25 after 3. ...cxd4 to -0.26 after 4. cxd4. perhaps 4. nf3 would have been better for white, offering a pawn for fast development. breaking the "knights before bishops" rule, but i didn't like the position for white after 5. nc3 - which seems to hand the initiative to black. 5. bd2 forces black to do something about the now threatened bishop on b4, enabling white to keep control of the game. theory recommends not bringing out the queen too early. the computer analysis recommends trading bishops instead: inaccuracy: +1.16 » … qa5 6. dxe5 bxd2+ 7. qxd2 qxe5 8. nc3 nf6 9. nf3 qe7 10. bd3 o-o 11. o-o nc6 12. rac1 d6 13. qg5. best: +0.45 » … bxd2+ 6. qxd2 exd4 7. qxd4 qf6 8. qd2 nc6 9. nc3 qe7 10. nf3 nf6 11. o-o-o o-o 12. qf4 qb4 13. qd6 re8 14. qxb4 nxb4. the recommended line does still have both queens out and about before a few of minor pieces though - theory isn't always reflected in practice! early queen action is probably ok here because neither can be easily "chased" by the minor pieces (and then they are swapped off following a few developing moves). white grabs a pawn! and black equalises material, but the queen is centralised with no minor pieces developed. i think this gives white a few good chances now - minor pieces can be brought out attacking the black queen and developing with tempo. ok - white's queen is diagonally in front of the king, but this isn't so dangerous now that the black bishops are off the board. having defended the e4 pawn, white begins gathering momentum - developing with tempo now that the black queen is exposed. the computer indicates that long castling was a mistake... inaccuracy: +1.12 » 10. o-o-o o-o 11. e5 ng4 12. bd3 qb6 13. rhf1 nc6 14. qf4 qb4 15. be4 f5 16. bd5+ kh8 17. qxb4 nxb4 18. bc4. best: +2.01 » 10. nb5 qxe4+ 11. be2 o-o 12. nc7 b6 13. o-o qb7 14. nxa8 qxa8 15. nd4 ne4 16. qf4 ba6 17. bxa6 nxa6. in the "best" line, white can win a rook for a knight. i suppose i overlooked it because of 10. ...qxe4+. leaving a pawn hanging that can be captured with check by the queen doesn't seem very appealing! i suppose the lesson to be learned is "look harder!". i wanted to follow this move up with 12. nd5 (threatening 13. nc7).  this moves defends the c7 square from my knight should i play nd5, but leaves black's position cramped, under-developed, and with not much defence around the king. white's plan now should be to bring out many pieces as quickly possible - first to consolidate control of the centre and then to attack the kingside. it seemed ok to block the d file at this point - black has no pieces that can safely pin the bishop. it also sets up the potential for a discovered attack later, with bxh7+. in addition 13. ng5 will be very dangerous for black, because the rook on f8 is "stuck" and white can follow up with nxh7 and then nxf8. getting ready to bring a rook into the action. makes room to "lift" the rook to the third rank, and then swing it across to the kingside. does this with tempo, attacking the queen. another "free" move for white. the knight was attacked, so white needed to do something. this moves the knight to safety, and threatens black's kingside. e.g. ne7 could now win black's bishop, and black must defend carefully - there are chances to go wrong. (e.g. 15. nd5, nc6 16. nxh6+ gxh6 17. qxh6 and black is in real trouble!). avoiding the problems described, but white is building up a huge attack and black doesn't have many good ways to get back into the game. getting ready for some rook action on the kingside... black finally gets chance to bring out a minor piece - but it's on the queenside - a long way from where the action is... the computer disagrees with this move strongly... mistake: +2.49 » 17. bb1 ne7 18. nxe7+ qxe7 19. nd5 qd8 20. qd4 kh8 21. nb6 rb8 22. bf5 nc7 23. nxd7 nb5 24. qd5 qc7+ 25. kb1 bxd7 26. qxd7. best: +4.04 » 17. nd5 qxd5 18. nxh6+ kh8 19. nxf7+ qxf7 20. rh3+ kg8 21. bh7+ kh8 22. bg6+ kg8 23. bxf7+ rxf7 24. rh5 ne7 25. rg5 nc6 26. rh1. i may be missing something, but in the "best" line, why would black take the knight (17. ...qxd5) when that line causes so many problems for black? the d5 knight doesn't seem to threaten it, and taking it just looks like an unforced error by black to me.

-------------------------------------
the reti opening: my favorite hypermodern approach as white. i expected nf6 or d5, but this move is new. wouldn’t recommend it. i continue developing slowing and fianchettoing. now controlling the centre. i think maybe d6 would also be good because the knight can then move to e4. i complete my fianchetto. now anu has complete control of the centre, but i have a nice developed kingside. finally developing the queenside now. standard developing bf5 would have been better, but anu wanted the queen behind the bishop for the threat of bxh3 later on. however, i still recommend bf5. bxh3 could happen now. note that if white went another move, and allowed bxh3, the follow-up could be like 8. ... bxh3 9. g4 bxg7 10. kxg7, leaving black a pawn up. on the other hand, if white went g4 immediately, the kingside would be slightly more exposed with the dangerous h2-b8 diagonal open to attack. and so the harassment of the black dsb has begun. notice how horribly placed black’s dsb is. ! this threatens 14. ... bxb3 15. qxb3 bxc5 and the dsb is back in the game. ra3 would have been more safe. i was threatening h5 but didn’t realize that after the combo i mentioned earlier, the rook would be guarding that pawn as well as the knight. and anu misses the attack. but my plan (accidentally) works. more pressure on h3. my heart is pounding at this point. the only safe move i could think of. relieving the pressure. black still hasn’t castled. now the dsb is free, but there is a threat along the long h1-a8 diagonal. ...and the dsb is trapped again. with the immediate threat of qe7#. black should have castled way earlier to avoid this. now the key is the nh7. !! a beautiful discovered attack! the only move. ha-ha! now black is in a real pickle. if the rook moves off the 7th rank, you’re doomed; if your knight is taken off the board, qf8 kills you. the last chance... !! now the f1 rook has the whole f-file to itself! a tempo too late. !!! whew! that was an amazing, exciting game between anu and i. my heart was pounding like crazy! hope you enjoyed! 
-------------------------------------
this is my testing scheme against such white's asset. no theory behind, just the feeling (and some experience with the same asset with white pieces!) not sure it is recommendable, but i tried it. i'm sure it's pretty covered by theory. asking questions (ah, the club jergon!) to b2. one of the less recommendable answers, because it makes me easy to develop and reach equality. no real threa on the black diagonal (not while the c pawn is mobile), but i have space to manouver. now, if i lose time by freeing my lsb, maybe - just maybe - i miss the chance to cause him some problems.  of course, if be3, d5 and this b has to move again to become useful.  ? i'm still dreaming of an attack on the black diag, so i make this lsb going out of the d2 coverage. but it was just a bad idea, since white can easily answer c4 - i'm giving him the occasion by allowing my n to be threatened. true is that in order to play it he has to play a3 first, and i can try the qa5 attack where if b4, nxb4, etc, since a3 is pinned to the r.  i didn't dare to play the qa4-b4-nxb4-cxb4-bxb4+, not while d2 is still all that covered.  ...so this is my "plan": to attack on the kingside (the original purpose of black's asset), but with the disadvantage of having the q almost useless on b6, and my own qside far from being able to develop. on the other side, white has more or less the same problem: he has to castle just under my advancing pawns, and his minor pieces can be harassed - soon or later. if i play d6, bd7, o-o-o... he will do whatever he wants (like c4. fortunately for me, he assumes that nb4 is still very powerful, but he can easily move his lsb from d3, or play a3 and make c4 a threat.) now, it was my chance. unfortunately, g4-nh4 kind of blocks my attack, and h4 was not possible due to nxg5 (h4 but the lsb can move. i can get rid of it, yes, but not much more (i could see!). but now it's my chance to play the "wonderful"... noah's ark in sight. if h3, f4, i'm not scared by bg6+, kd8. i can exchange this b, sure, but i'll have in e5 a n, threatening to come to g6... i wasn't sure. these were time-consuming moments for both of us.  this pins my own f pawn, but i dont' have to move it necessarily. i'm doing this because i want to keep my r on th h column, in sight of a possible sacrifice (nxg5). moreover: i can play on this lsb by harassing it with d6, and it will be lost for white. in return, i'll have to waken my e6 pawn, which is very dangerous in this asset. the advantage of doing that: white, as far as i can see, is in no position to cause a serious threat on e6 in few moves. my lsb will become active without even having moved from his home square. my r is trapped, as his. a r on the 7ºth will always help my k... no risk, no win. i think i can hold e6. but i was wrong: now white has bxf4, and if exb... nxg5, hxn, qxg4!?... the sac! more time-consuming decisions... no basis for the sac. he just helped me. i hope so, at least! true is that i will have to play carefully - not like my usual! you have to be careful with things like be7??, qg8+, winning the r.  here, white realizes that he has 1) b2 threatened, 2) if dxe5, it just opens a future line for my lsb and give action to my q. 3) rxe5 was just losing the exchange... so he thought it was smart to play... ...instead. he hopes in bh5+, but i have a better move to play.  white is +4, but he is just too underdeveloped. his sacs were not well timed. the interesting part of this clumsy game is the center situation. look at it... but now, black has serious threats, for example, nxg2 (followed by rg7) a desperado - and useless move. at this point, you may say black is just winning, and that the game is over. but another thing is to play it with less-than one minute on the clock (5 sec increment, but still...) i have to be careful. if rxg2+, kh1, rxf7 (say), white has bh5+, etc. if pieces are exchanged, my own caged pieces and exposed k may become a factor... my escape route, as planned. my k will become exposed, but he has an escape route... ! if kxc6, bf3+ and the game is over! but thanks to my r on g7, my k is safe for the moment. of course, a direct cxb7, bxb7 is winning.  the best for the white q. now, with few seconds on the clock, i was so confused about how to take the best advantage of the position, that i made a fatal mistake.  ...and now what? i feel i have missed the right combination. here, qxb2 seems decisive, since if kxn, rg1#. but white has qxe4+, and i can't play bd6 or qxr... and if kxc6, be8+... aaaghh!!! i sacced the n, but defending e5, just in case. i didn't see be2, but if played, rg1+, kxr, qxbe2, threatening mate on g2, and with nc2 as a "plus" in case all goes wrong... ?? it was very few time, and i missed the winner. anyway, this should be winning... if i keep my mind together! ...and now i can't see how to continue the attack. true, i can take the nb1, i can risk something like a5, but he can now give me check on f7, and he can take my bf8... too risky! i can still lose this! ?? it was so simple to play bc4... :-( sob! material is even again - but the position is still thrilling. now i tried to win some time with silly checks. ? my plan is to make him land on a black square, or something, so to save my b and prevent him to harass my k. yes, i can win the ra1 (qc1+, ke2, qxb2+, k moves, qxr), but this leaves my b and my k in a very difficult position - or, at least, i assumed it was! so... i can see no mate, and he has to take care of f2. curiousely, if i exchange q, he will have the same chances as me. i have lost too much, i have to accept my fail, and get to recover the material while i can.  now: i am a r up, but my pieces are still pinned in its initial squares... so my extra r is not really playing. and both k so exposed... is this a crazy game? seconds on the clock. i can't lose this by time. bd6 was easy, but i needed simplification... my wonderful lsb holds all my position... from his initial square! ? he was with seconds, too... ...hoping in.. ??  it was not a great game, from both sides. but i kept on and managed to save a difficult game (after a sound blunder!), and stressed him too much to the end.

this was a fascinating game. after a complex middle game - which the post-match computer analysis (pmca) says black makes a couple of mistake. it comes down to a queen v 2 rooks ending. the computer thinks i made a mistake, but my opponent says it was drawn anyway. is he right? and if he is right, were his two "mistakes" really mistakes, if he was holding the position anyway. is the pmca right, or is my opponent right? please study and tell me your views, dear reader. so it starts conventionally enough i continue with my usual black prepares to develop his bf8 to g7 so i continue, and threaten e2-e4 he opts for the grünfeld defence, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence) rather than the king's indian defence with bg7 instead of d7-d5 i continue with the exchange variation, the most popular reply. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence#exchange_variation:_4.cxd5_nxd5_5.e4 so he takes back i seize the centre, or center, as my american friends would say he takes - the usual continuation i take back he continues with development. white can develop his pieces in a number of ways in the exchange variation. for decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with bc4 and ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. it was generally thought that an early nf3 was weak in the exchange variation because it allowed black too much pressure on the centre with ...bg4. in the late 1970s, however, karpov, kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange variation with white, often involving an early rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of black's queenside. with this move, i am planning on playing rb1 next move. he hits at my centre so i do my rook move. he castles this is the usual square for the bishop in this variation so he develops. and i hit the knight, going into very complicated variations! black can take the pawn on c3 with his bishop with check, but after bc1-d2 black has to part with his powerful black squared bishop, as his knight on c6 is hanging. after bxc3+ 11. bd2 bxd2+ 12. qxd2 white has full compensation for the sacrifices pawn, so black doesn't normally accept the offered pawn. this is the usual move so i take he takes back i protect my c3 pawn now i can't play 0-0 as he can meet that with bxh2 check so i consolidate my centre and make it possible for my rook to swing across the third rank. and he hits at my centre. i was hoping to follow kakageldyev, amanmurad (2365) vs. mikhalchishin, adrian (2530), which white won, but black played f7-f5 in that game. i'm thinking for myself now! so i prepare to castle he continues to develop i move my queen to a better square, perhaps with bc1-b2 and if he exchanges, retake with my queen, doubling up on b7 he opens up, the e file, a great idea with my king still on e1 so i take back he moves the rook onto the open e file so i get my king out of the line of fire my opponent now comes with this fine pawn sac so i take he advances i attack the pawn he advances again, attacking my queen so i move my queen he attacks it again so my queen is forced to move. he hits my rook i defend my rook he hits it again i move it again the pmca says this is a mistake, and prefers  rac8 24. bd3 bd7 25. a4 c2 26. rh4 f5 27. g3 re1 28. kg2 re7 29. rg1 kh8 30. kh1, which it says is only plus 0.25 to white, as opposed to the game continuation, which is ranks as plus 0.89 for white. is this really true? your views - and/or how your computer assesses this position would be most welcome! certainly at the time, i didn't think this was a mistake. now white has some concrete threats on the king side so he takes the pawn i sacrifice the exchange to open up his kingside he takes back i take his pawn. notice he can't take my be2 because of qg4 check, also attacking his re2 so he takes my bishop on c1 instead i take back with the rook. i have some nasty threats involving bd3 followed by queen checks in h7 followed by h8, driving his king out into the open so the queen has to hurry back i take the pawn, threatening join in the attack with rg3 check already black is looking at the queen vs 2 rooks ending - and so was i. i thought i may be able to win, it, my opponent thought he could draw. at the time i thought qg6 was a mistake, and pmca thinks so too, and gives qh6 29. bh5 re1+ 30. kh2 f6 31. rc7 kh8 32. rc8+ rxc8 33. qxc8+ kg7 34. qc7+ kg8 35. bf7+ kg7 36. qxa7 qf4+ 37. g3 qd6 38. be6+ kh6as a playable line for black, with an assessment that this is "only" 2.38 in white's favour, as opposed to the game continuation which it gives as 3.55 in white's favour. but is the computer right? your views would be most welcome! so i pin the queen he takes my bishop i take the queen he takes back this way, to give his king more shelter i move my queen up he throws in a check this is forced he offers to exchange pawns but now he hasn't time to take he has to watch this pawn so i make way for the advancing pawn he doubles up on the d pawn so i go after the a pawn he takes i take he prepares to double again the b pawn i throw in a check king moves another check king back this is to prevent either rook leaving the d file so he hits the queen i throw in a check king moves. now this is where the pmca thinks i made a mistake. it things i should continue with 41. qe4 rd4 42. qc2 r1d2 43. qc3 r2d3 44. qa5 rd7 45. b6 f6 46. qb5 r3d5 47. qa6 r5d6 48. kg3 rd2 and claims that this is plus 2.9 for white. but my opponent thinks this line is still drawn. who is right? this is one last hope for a mistake from black. i was hoping for rb2?? allowing qe5 check but he doesn't fall for those. thought the b pawn is going, and then is it clearly drawn. may as well accept. check again king goes back and draw agreed, on my proposal. many thanks for reading this, and i look forward to reading your comments! please rate the annotation on the star scheme of rating, so i get an idea how i am doing. 
-------------------------------------
at last someone that goes more or less like me! i decided to play the "weirdest" move i could concieve, just for fun.  ok, no punishment, good new.  second "weirdest". the idea is to control c3 to let my queen out.  now, i started to look for more "funny" moves.  ...and, doing so, i almost trapped my queen!!!! if b4, i had to play nxb4 in order to save it! a piece for two pawns... well... i am completely undeveloped, you know.... he either doesn't see it, or he is so sure i am so crazy that i "must" have a winning plan, that plays very conservatively. this saves my queen to become trapped. thank you, serg... again, this doesn't save me, but it looks as i have a plan on the dark squares. :-d develop, buddy, don't play foolish moves like this one... what else to do with he lsb? lose castling rights! (and make my queen much safer!) ah, you want to fork me! well, your knight will be trapped after, my bishop won't! maybe kf7 was better. ¡ñam! (read as: "gnam" :-). a little excercise: not to leave the knight escape! he is doing his homeworks, too... now, qf5 seemed interesting, but not enough to save the bishop, so... first of all. 5 lined pawns in the 6th row. all my 8 pawns connected...! here the game loses interest for a while, due to a lot of oversight by white. or qxe3, even better.  ok, the typical "won game" that i manage to lose. so think twice. the next move, white will go ra1, and then rxa7. the situation can become even dangerous - so be smart.  now take the pawn, if you dare... ok, now i defend adequately the a pawn (a5 was not possible due to nxb6, dear beginner, i trust you saw it before).  can i take the knight the next move? qxn, qxb6+, and if axqb6, rxqa8, so... yes, but i must know what will happen next.  the wise one is qxq. in position like this, you have to take with the intention to simplify. so i played the "wrong" one, because i play for fun, and i bet it would have held.  now, again, be careful. white is threatening qxe6, so, what i have to defend? is this more or less dangerous than a queen's exchange on a7 or a8? this is the right one (not the only one, of course), no matter the black bishop can penetrate now. anyway, this is not good for white. but what else? yes, qc2, looking to get in via g6! if i rh6, bf4 and i am in a little big trouble.  i can avoid the exchange, but i think the result would have been the same, only more complicated.  so he gets me cramped. but i have nothing to fear. can you see the trick to get out of the cramped position? i'll show you later. but you have to keep in mind that the important piece is my king, preventing the white rook to get some of my pawns.  wrong. the pawn won't reach the 8th before the white king. i already made my mistake. now, let's do another. if ever he dxe5, my c and b pawns will be free to go ahead and promote.  oh, what the hell, i already know how to get free, so no problem in closing the rest.  this is the key move.  now, the bishop can fly, g7 is defended.  ok, and we are at another standpoint. how can i make some progress?  the only move (i can see) to break white! with +6! or gxh, it is more or less the same thing.  no hope for white.  i decided to be a little sadistic here.  i can stop the pawn, losing the rook, and win with the b and c pawns, but i like to be sadistic when possible.  a funny game until the end, i think.  
-------------------------------------
it’s psychologically very strange to play someone who has almost forfeited a game by showing up nearly an hour late. on the one hand you feel a lot of pressure to win, because you almost werewinning. on the other hand, there is no way to directly convert that clock advantage into a chess advantage.  as for mike, he said that his intention was to “play a dozen moves and offer him a draw.” and in fact, that’s what he did. wang, to his very great credit, refused the offer. if he was going to win the club championship, he was going to do it by beating the five-time champion, not by taking a draw offer before the fighting really began. but this, too, might have put some pressure on wang; when you turn down a draw, you then feel as if you have to justify doing so. ! mike liked this repositioning of the bishop and i do, too. mike says that wang took so long on his last two moves that they were almost even on time! the position indeed looks very dangerous for black, as all of his pieces are in a clump on the queenside, while his kingside is defended only by a solitary bishop. when mike showed this game at his chess party last week, i think that everyone who hadn’t seen it expected that it would end with a powerful kingside attack for white. but that’s not what happened. somehow or other the young upstart managed to distract white’s attention from the kingside. it starts with a very nice positional pawn sacrifice. ! when you see moves like this, you know you’re not dealing with just any ordinary 15-year-old. with 19. … c4, black is trying to take control over the narrative, to make it be about his pieces and not mike’s. if mike accepts the pawn with 20. bc, then black gets terrific compensation after 20. … na4 21. bd4 nxd4 22. nxd4 bc 23. nxc4 nc3! already black has a serious threat to sacrifice the exchange on d4 and play … qc6, threatening mate on the long diagonal. though white can defend this, he is forced to retreat, and the position will become one where black’s pieces control the board and dictate the action. so mike turns down the offer and tries to keep the initiative on side. but his young opponent will not be denied. ! great stuff. threatening ... c3. ! on one hand, this move is easy to understand. white wants to keep the queenside closed, because that is where black’s pieces are massed. but on the other hand, mike is giving away a pawn. in reality he had committed himself to sacrificing the e5-pawn as soon as he played 22. c3. mike’s comment on this move at the chess party was totally characteristic of him. why did he play this move? “i’m winning the endgame!” he said.  on the one hand, this is totally nuts. black has lots of chances after this to equalize or even stand better. on the other hand, it’s so mike. remember the mike splane question: “how am i going to win this game?” he asks it in almost every game, whether his position is better or worse. here, how he is going to win the game is very simple. he’s going to win black’s two weak queenside pawns, at c4 and a6, and then he’s going to run his connected passers to paydirt. the deeper lesson here is that the “objective evaluation” or “computer evaluation” doesn’t always matter in a contest between humans. if you have a plan and your opponent doesn’t, you’re winning. also it doesn’t hurt to have a ghost named george helping you! ?! my immediate reaction, when mike showed us this game, was that this was an inaccuracy. black should play 27. … bf6. we have all been conditioned by experience to put the bishop on g7, because we have seen so many thousands of fianchettoed bishops. by contrast, the bishop on f6 looks a little bit loose and strange. but you have to play the concrete position in front of you. the point of 27. … bf6 is to throw a monkey wrench into white’s plans on the kingside. if 28. ng5 black can play 28. … bxg5 29. qxg5 bxe4 30. rxe4 rd5 31. qh6 rh5 with advantage, according to rybka. ! as mike said, he would be thrilled if black forked the queen and rook! after 29. … f5? 30. qh4 fe (or 30. … bf6 31. rxe6) 31. qh7+ kf8 32. nxe6+ wins. this is the point at which, if i were playing black, i would say “oh-oh.” there are so many weak spots in black’s position, and they all seem to have pawns on them: a6, c4, e6, f7, g6. black could play 29. … ra8, but it’s a cheerless defensive move. rybka likes 29. … bf6 best in spite of the loss of tempo, but black is scarcely likely to play that after turning it down a move earlier. i think that the move wang chose is right on principle. he’s a pawn up, and he has an opportunity to give the pawn back to create more activity for his pieces. ! i’m so impressed with wang’s play, even though he lost this game. by the way, if you’re counting, this is the third positional pawn sacrifice of the game. players rated 2000 and below should really pay attention to this game, because this is the sort of move that class-a players and below almost never play. of course, class-a players are perfectly able to play pawn sacrifices, but only when they can calculate their way to the end. here it’s not calculation but positional judgement that says, “i’m going to suffer if i don’t give back the pawn.” at mike’s chess party some people thought that 31. … qf5 was a better try, but actually it’s worse. after 32. qh4 (you didn’t really think white would settle for the queen trade, did you?) nf6 33. rf4 or 32. qh4 nxc3 33. bxc3 bxc3 34. rf4 black will have his work cut out for him to salvage a draw. ?! no one at the chess party made any comment at all about this move — like 27. … bg7, it’s the sort of automatic move that doesn’t raise any red flags. i mean, what could be more natural than putting both rooks benko gambit-style on the files where white has “hanging pawns”?  it was only when the computer voiced its strong preference for 33. … rb6! that i started looking more carefully at this move. with 33. … rc8 you are taking a rook that is already in a perfect, active position and spending a tempo to move it to a less active position. that might sound surprising to you because the rook looks active on c8. but you have to consider the concrete position. white’s plan is to move his knight to e4 and then c5, and at that point black’s so-called active rook will be biting on granite. anyway, in general, you should always question how “active” a rook really is when it’s in front of a passed pawn. repeat after me: rooks belong behind passed pawns. a line that really shows the difference between 33. … rb6 and 33. … rc8 arises if white tries to play the same way he did in the game: 33. … rb6 34. ne4 ne5 35. nc5 nc4! for 13 moves the bishop on b2 has been the secret achilles’ heel in white’s position, and now it starts to hurt. white cannot grab the pawn with 36. rxa6?? because he loses a whole bishop after 36. … rd1+ 37. kg2 rxa6 38. nxa6 rb1. now you see why a rook behind the passed pawn is better than a pseudo-active rook in front of it! after playing actively for so long, black has finally been forced into passive defense. kudos to mike (and his ghostly companion) for having the foresight to see that this would happen! however, objectively, black is not lost yet. at the party, mike thought this was a mistake and he should have played 38. bc3, winning. however, the computer shows that is not correct. after 38. bc3 ng4 (also possible in the game) 39. bxg7 kxg7 40. r2a2 it looks for a moment as if white is going to win the a-pawn outright, but after the simple sidestep 40. … rb8! white’s pawns collapse. better would be something like 40. ne4 rxc4 41. ba, but i completely agree with rybka that black should be able to defend this. of course, 38. … ng4 would draw as in the previous note. and here, after playing excellent chess for so many moves, the 15-year-old wunderkind finally cracks.  here black could have drawn the game and won the club championship with 39. … nd5! perhaps he didn’t play this move because everything is en prise, but the threat of … bxd4+ and … bxa1 is so huge that white is forced into liquidating material. after 39. … nd5 40. bxg7 rxc5 41. b moves rxc4 black should be able to draw. the knight on d5 is such a rock, and it keeps white from advancing his passed b-pawn. note also that if white is careless, he could screw up. for instance, 39. … nd5 40. bf2? rxc4 41. bxc4 bxa1 42. cd rxd5 43. rc2?? rxc5! and black wins. or maybe wang simply thought he was winning after the move he played, ?? ? here 40. … ne4 would put up a better fight, but white is still winning after 41. rxe4 bxa1 42. bf2. the connected passers are too much. did wang really overlook this simple pin? i guess he must have. after this it’s hopeless for black, and the game concluded  black resigns.  although the end was a little bit disappointing, especially for young mr. wang, the rest of the game was really outstanding, master-level chess. the student should pay special attention to the positional pawn sacrifices and to the mike splane question: how am i going to win this game? also, there are some good lessons about automatic moves — before you play moves like 27. … bg7 and 33. … rdc8, ask yourself what your pieces are doing on those squares. 
-------------------------------------
the dangerous budapest. i am exploring it, but i am still not convinced.  you can trhow the check in now, but it doesn' make much difference. still, it is better to do it inmediately, to stop the white queen's excursion to d4 or d5. this bishop is doomed, but it can always take the knight.  no need to take bxn at once, unless white wastes a move forcing me.  now, i have to state that all this was for something. i am still far from castling... queenside! the fisrt shot.  pawn or queen? the queen in e5 is very well placed, and threats b2 (the bishop can be saved after qxb2, rb1, qc6, etc... or so i thought).  taking with the pawn would have provided a nice d open column, but probably i couldn't have used it for castling anymore, and... my kingside is to attack.  at least. i could have retired the bishop, but i didn't want to provide so much space to white pursuing it with the pawns.  just throwing it there.  good for him and for me... interesting.  this check would be absolutely correct, and without it, i would have lost sooner.  maybe wiser bf5. definitely.  the right one.  the wrong one. i shoud have taken c5.  uh-oh... look at the only place for the queen... a lot of tactic here... wait.  white thinks it is so easy to throw a rook on e1 and win... but... now, if re1+, be6. but white went... ! so i have material advantage, an open king, and undeveloped rooks... this is a new game! how to proceed? double-edged move. i smelt danger in taking the a pawn... qg5 by white could have been very annoying.  not kd7, losing the queen, of course, and not kd8, blocking forever my rook.  i was right to keep my queen on the diagonal.  in this sequence, i am threatening all the time the back rank mate, and i am even piling up to g2. but, despite my advantage, i find difficult to unravel my pieces.  stopping his checks. if i can exchange queens, the trick is done.  this was like a "defiánce glove"... i can defend, and more than that, i am pinning the bishop.  again, maybe better was re8. or rb8, in sight of the loss of a pawn i overlooked.  maybe f6 was indicated, instead. but it starts to look funny.  i tried to imagine a way to provoke unbalance, and see if i can take advantage once more from the back rank threat. it will cost me pawns, and the game.  now, he trheats bxf7, so... or re1, better. or, again, f6.  third lost pawn.  not a good move, but prevents him to move the bishop for a moment.  well, i liked my queen, but now it's over. no back rank mate. i think i should have considered to return the exchange if i could have recovered some pawn in the midtime. but i threw my advantage away. the bishop, here, is as strong as a rook.  "i still have time to stop the pawn in c... mistake. i should have taken the pawn. anyway, white should have played his rook to c1, in my opinion.  the h pawn is lost, because if re5, my rook doesn't control anymore the c pawn. it could have had the time to come back to the 7th or 8ht rank, but... just bad. better let him take the pawn and got an extra tempo for pawn's grabbing.  so i cannot even retake the pawn with the check.  we both overlooked the c column for our rooks... at last... 45 moves for a blitz are a lot. i was kind of lost, here. i must admit.  interesting. by changing the crowning's square colour, it should be easier for me to stop his pawns.  now the king takes the white pawn, and while white tried to progress on the other side... white realized the mate net he was falling into.  here, i followed the wrong plan (but everyone would have been bad...) my final blunder, i didn't consider the obvious... no time to threat again a mate. thank you for reading, i hope you enjoyed the game.  
-------------------------------------
i know you know i'lll go for this one. i'm not facing opponents strong enough to play correctly against it, so it kind of works.  the second choice, leading to a completely different game from the budapest i usually face (dxe, ng4). black must be careful not to be squeezed in, so i get the b into the game with tempo, prepared to exchange it, even for a n, for developement tempos. in my experience, i kind of "have to" play this way, giving my b pair for castling and d6, if don't want to go for a slow and squeezed game as black. not my style (not on blitz, anyway!). standard... getting my pieces out. now, if bxb, qxb+, white has to play qe2, and black is fine after, say, a lot of possible moves including a5, qxq+, or qc5 (heading for ng4) ok, you want the exchange, and i know that is nothing better than... he developed the n, i couldn't help it, but i am ahead in developement now, despite the nasty pawn chain.  ! sorry for the undeserved exclamation, but this is important. white can't attack trice the pawn, defenden twice. black has it easy to play d6-bf5. f3 is not playable, or e3. the ng can't go to c3. black is not any bad, isn't he? what else? white is not in zugzwang, either. he will develop slowly, and i have no quick attack to perform... do i? what would you say? controlling d4 (if nf4, g5). if dxc6ep, nxc6 helps me in developing. i don't fear qa4+ or qb3 while my lsb is ready to go to d7. white's supporting forces are too far.  controlling f5, right. now, it is still a bit delicate to develop the q side for black, dued to qa4/qb3. not a real danger, but say nd7, qa4, o-o, b4, nb6, qa5... and maybe white has something to bother me for a while.  i can manage qa4+ now with no major problems, since on the worst, my b can still come back to d7. and i can castle, for sure. (secretely, i don't want to castle, here: i want to attack! my pawn in e5 has now the power to make f3 unthinkable for white, so a bit vulnerable. i have to exploit those weaknesses, this is all chess's about, after all! :-) this is a doubled edged move. the principle of attack is met: instead of retreating, i "use" the exchange to bring another open line for my pieces, some kind of "keeping white busy". i foresaw nxh5 wouldn't save white after bxb... n or pawn? white has a nf5 move that is strong because it attacks g7. the h4 "threat" doesn't help me much.  i can't avoid nf5 (qf8 is ugly, but the best). at least this keeps the wq far from the kside.  e5 is attacked now trice, and it will fall. too bad. i can live with it, and use the tempo in order to improve my position. i spotted that if ng3 was out, maybe my pawn could sac in g3. nothing more... take e5, but now i'm developed, and you won't go for qa5, since it is not his aim, obiously. if he does, i'll manage, i'm confident. he doesn't seem to have even though about that. exchanging q with a pawn less in such a position was a mistake, but i've spotted that.... ..., thanks to g4 pawn, was safe. now i still have to unravel myself, but i swear i can play it even after nf5-qf8. maybe. was i right? aha! surprise! this moves sets a threat for the near future, after say castling... can you see it? correctly, white attacks my weak side, and it's only matter of time it will be defeated. if the game opens on the qside, i feel i'll be lost. i have to use the h column for the r, or i'm doomed.  this was my "save the say" move.  too bad for the "g3 plan", but hey, now i have a stunning and crushing move to play, but for my damn k is on the way. but if i take it away, i just allow the very, very dangerous bxc4, that threats cxd3, which will make my ne5 a goner. i have a very short time to get out of this. can you figure out how i did it? ...casting into the enemy's fire. but kd7 left my k exposed to pawn's checks in a couple of moves, and this would have been very dangerous. plus, i had a plan to slowen white's attack for some more moves. i have plans for his k... oh, dearest, i love you!!!! you gave a purpose to my life on this game! you's tiying yourself just into the fire, and you just "follow principles"! (i'm not against principles alltogether, just pretend to make beginners think in it as in any other move: good or bad, a waste or a needed one, depending on the board, not to "principles"... ;-) said that: to castle is normally good, and it's still to be recommended many, many times. in order to see someone that rarely castles, look into my games! :-d. now: black has a "straight away killer move" that seals white's fate in few moves. it's a "tactic-problem-like" situation: what is the move? i missed it in the game. no, it wasn't this one. it was nf3+. white must take it with the pawn, then gxf3. black threats qh4, with qxh2# to follow if, for example, qxf3, qh2#. can white save himself? rf-b1, for example, to make room for the k... so, i missed the "tallish move nº1". i'm not tal not even by far, just an admirer. but now, hey, qxh2# is a threat, and white has only one move. now, be careful: not gxh3, or qxq and my attack vanishes.  think, dear beginner, that g4 is safe: i threaten mate if the column is open. but i will be able to play gxh3 next move, opening up your k.  you prefer to attack. ok. my clock is running, but i'm not resourceless. here, is gxh3 the best way to contiue? can you tell? ok. this was crushing before. is it now? can you tell me? remember your answer for the very last move. i played it just out of instinct, or desperation (it was a blitz, unfortunately). i coudn't calculate everything. but i sensed that h2 would have been mine sooner or later. not too late, i hoped...  white can defend. if gxf3, qxf3 and after qxh3, qg2 and white is saved. and if... ? white has qxg4+ (which i missed!), so the q's will be exhanged, and my sac would have been in vain. i played an unsound sacrifice. but if i'm not tal, my opponent isn't fisher either! :-) he made room for his k, and correctly saw that my qh2+ just went into nothing. i saw it, too. here, a much better move for black would have been f5, but still it didn't go to anything concrete, as far as i saw, so i played... i'm not doing anything, really. in fact i helped him, since his q is much more powerful there than in its previous position. anyway, after qf4, d3 was doomed, and with it, the game. this is the reason i played this one: i can't allow the white d5 pawn to move by any mean, or i'm lost. no rd7 can help me against the coming c5 etc. i can't play bxc6 for the same reason i explained before. but i had (from the moment i castled long, in a way) that may strategy would have been to delay this attack as long as i could. i played... he needs more moves now to break into my defences. it's up to me to find the way to win. can i? what would you say? white knows that i'm down, and if i exchange q's, all my hopes are gone.  i keep the threat on the h column, and i look to c4.  ?? happy to release himself from the "h column latent threat", white makes a fatal mistake, overlooking... i'm still -3, but now i feel the game is mine. is it? what would you say? if ke1 instead, qc3+ keeps the checks game on.  no, i'm not defending the g6 pawn. i'm doubling r's on the h column, since you can see i can easily threat to make him sac his q for a r, forcedly... of course you can see how! "please note how black is ignoring the power or the two white pawns..." ...and drives his q in an awakward place... but a r-safe one! d5 is still blocked, and if c7, rd-h8 is my intention anyway! ?? ok, but... can white unravel himself and come out "alive" from this position? i bet "no", but i'm not sure.  still allowing his pawn's attack to proceed... but now the threat is concrete, and forces white into... only one, otherwise rh1+ is crushing.  anyway. i have to do something "more" than qa5+, or nc3 could be the end of the story for me. i still have to be accurate, and on pressure... you know. which is my "real" target? which is the square that will decide the game in my favour? where the war will be won or lost? white's weakest spot? yes! just what i wanted. now... ...threatening rxf2+, winning... ...the "winner". not easy to find, but probably more crushing that is seems at first sight until you note nc3's weakness... what else? another "slam" move. white must give material back, but it's not finished yet. from here on is a "slaunt the rabbit" story. from now, the correct way to follow was... not this one. qc3+ instead is more precise: white's k is forced out of the 1st rank, then qb2+ forces is still farther, on 3rd, and from there my rh7 could check... and so on. but i had no time left, and i went for him slowly but... mercisleely :-) he helped himself out by himself, anyway... rd2+, qc2# worked too... now, please come back and answer: was, ultimately, nxf3+ a soudn sac, or wasn't it? answer: if white hadn't blundered c4, probably the answer would have been "no".   
-------------------------------------
 this is my second game with another master buddy whose name is jeff - the first was a bit of a disaster.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=12471496&fb=1&rnd=0.36667961087623424.  as you could see from that analysis we played by the book for the best part of the game and when we came out of it, boy did you see those howlers on my part!  well, in this game the improvement was that:- 1. we came out of the book on move 10.  2.  computer analysis only flagged up two of my moves as an innaccuracy and a mistake respectively.  the innaccuracy was on move 14 and the mistake was on move 43, the move before i waved the white flag.  3.  the game lasted longer, so i suppose it was better.  i started off with a 3 knights opening, i.e. a double king pawn opening with 3 of the knights emerging.  3. nc3 - this move characterises the 3 knights opening. 4. bb5 - a delayed ruy lopez.  5. ..... bc5 - here jeff sacrifices a pawn for speedy development. 6. nxe5 - i decided to accept the sac, after all a pawn is a pawn. 9. nd5 - this is recommended in the world db but it does violate opening principles of moving the same piece twice. 10. exd6 - here i decided to consolidate my 1 pawn advantage but in retrospect it would have been better to have played nxb6 before trading pawns.  that dsb is gonna be a major thorn in my side for the rest of the game. 11. ne3 - nxb would have been bad here as it would have allowed a nasty queen check on e7 or e6 forcing henry to move to f1 and forfeit castling rights, so i decided to block the e column by backing off my horsie. 12. nxf5 - i traded my knight for the other bishop.  note that qe7+ or qe6+ are now bad - reason, the knight can go back to e3 and block and black will have lost a piece.  so jeff recaptures with the knight and i decided to tuck henry away on the kingside. 14. ne1 - here is the innaccuracy:-  -0.46 » 14. ne1 qf4 15. qf3 qxa4 16. qxf5 rfe8 17. nf3 re2 18. ng5 rae8 19. kh1 qc6 20. rb1 bd4

-------------------------------------
 i guess that kf1 would have probably have been a good idea at this point, at least the f2 pawn will have no longer been pinned against henry by that wretched dsb on b6. 15. qf3 - there are a lot of black pieces buzzing around henry.  i see fou leblanc is hanging on a4.  qf3 does not lose a piece however because if the wicked witch of the west snaps up fou leblanc then the knight on f5 is hanging.  glenda duly swipes it. 17. d3 - time to open up a line for fou lenoir. 18. ...... c6 - to prevent qxb7. 19. bg5- at last fou lenoir leaves the back rank.  however, my rooks are not connected because of that knight on e1.  that was no doubt why the computer did not like ne1. 20. ...... rde8 - ominous pile up on the e column. 22. ..... qd6 - declining the exchange of queens. 24. bh4 - jeff considered this move was a mistake.  here are his comments "well you were playing really well up until move 24 when you played bh4. instead taking my bishop would have been a good move. bishop takes knight, queen takes bishop and c3 to strenghen the centre. also on the 26th move when you played rd2, rf1 would have been slightly better".  here the computer increased jeff's advantage from 0.37 - 0.44. 26. ..... g5 - an attempt to distract fou lenoir from the defense of the f2 pawn. 31. re1 - here i drop fou lenoir for two pawns.  sadly these little footmen are no match for that wretched dsb on b6.  34. kxe1 - jeff trades rooks and now i find myself in an endgame with 2 pawns against that awful bishop. 35. c3 - an attempt to try and close off the a7-g1 diagonal but it is to no avail. 37. ...... ke6 - this king is coming into play with deadly effect. 39. ..... c4 - a brilliant move which scotches the idea of henry moving to f3 without me losing the d3 pawn to devastating effect. 40. d4 - that diagonal i mentioned in a previous note has been blocked by a white pawn at last.  alas it avails me naught because jeff's king is poised to eat pawns after moving to e4. 42. a5 - a little bit of thrashing around before i finally end up in a zugzwang. 43. h4? - here is what the computer had to say about this move:- mistake: -7.97 » 43. h4 a6 44. kd2 kf3 45. d5 be7 46. ke1 kxg3 47. ke2 kxf4 48. kf2 bxh4+ 49. kf1 ke5 50. d6 kxd6 51. ke2 f4 52. kf3 ke5 53. kg2

a wild, wild game with horrible moves by both sides... but funny, i think.  an interesting option for black is this quick attack. but it is advisable to have the bishop on the f8 square... trying a different approach to the opening, not usual for me. the idea is to take advantage of the diagonal, but is a double edged fight that probably would have costed me the game in an expert's hand.  black favours my plan by weakening c6. on the other side, if he wants to untangle his pieces he should be fighting to be safely able to play c5.  i should have stuck to my plan, with bg2, but... axb5 was better, but note that i am not still able to secure my dominion of the white diag. so i made a solid outpost for a piece in b6... black is unsure about how to develop.  but now he has a plan: e5.  so i prevent it by playing myself to e5. i have the power to to this.  i sacrifice the good bishop, but the diag will be closed to his bishop, too. black's worst enemy is his own e7 pawn.  i prefer to exchange here and keep the diagonal closed. my king has to castle, and i want it kingside. so it is not wise to overopen the game.  good by black. now i am in little trouble. fortunately (would you have said that?) my outpost is excellent... simply. this turned out to be more complicated for me than foreseen, due to my unwise moves.  a scaring position.  my secret weapon.  solid as a rock! and with a mate threat almost done! et voilà! black sees it.  anyway.  i adore castling when it is an attacking move, but probably g5 would have been more accurate.  i can cash some edge by exchanging queens due to f5. but it is far too low a prize for me.  blacks doesn't see the danger. i can take the knight, but it was nicer... here i blundered, since qxh5 was mate. but i had already seen the following:  and that's all...  
-------------------------------------
in my younger days i never opened with this move. it has the reputation of being less aggressive than 1. e4, probably undeservedly. the most common reply. it is my usual reply as well, although i am tossing around the idea of switching to the slav, as i have been having trouble against it recently. i've also played 2. bg5, although my results with it have been less than wonderful, to say the least. i used to find this scary, but my recent results against it have been encouraging. personally i think accepting the gambit here is too dangerous. in this line white is willing to give back the pawn, but wants to make black work for it. much to my surprise, the gameknot analyzer considers this to be not merely an inaccuracy, but a mistake. the machine prefers 5. … ab5 and calls it even. i don't think black's position is that terrible here. he has eliminated white's central pawn and has a majority of pawns in the center, although at the cost of weakening the king side. if black is careful, this shouldn't be a big problem. but as this game demonstrates, that's a big if. this is a natural enough move, although other moves, such as 7. … bb7 and 7. … be7 have been tried with success. in view of white's next move, 8. … be7 probably would have been a better try. not a move i would have considered except for when i stumbled across the games tatai vs. bellon lopez and solonzhenkin vs bistrikova, both of which led to victories for white. the point of white's last move is that capturing the e pawn is too dangerous. best is probably 9. … bc7 as in tatai vs. bellon lopez or the ignominious retreat 9. … as recommended by the gameknot analyzer. 9. … nbd7 was tried in solozhenkin vs. bistrikova, but this simply drops a pawn without much compensation. i thought this move was natural enough, but 12. bc4 was stronger. my smallfish analyzer evaluates the position as +1.1 after that, as opposed to +0.5 after 12. qh5. forced. finally the bishop retreats to where it should have been all along. it would have been nice to be able to play 14. nxc5, but white is embarrassed after 14. … rf5. at any rate, white's knight already has designs on black's king and is not to be distracted by the pickin's on the queen side. smallfish prefers here 14. qg6 qe8 15. qxe8 rxe8 16. be3. the gameknot analyzer passed this over without comment, but smallfish says it is much worse than 14. … ab5. after black's move in the game, smallfish puts white at +1.5 as opposed to +0.2 after 14. … ab5. the problem with this move is that now white has d3 for his bishop. best was the ignominious retreat 15. … qd8 strong enough, one would think, but smallfish found 16. bxh6! the point is that on 16. … gh6, then 17. qg6+ kh8, 18. qxh6+ kg8, 19. qg6+ kh8, 20. o-o-o and black is helpless against the dual threats of rd5! and rd3 a bad blunder which loses immediately. black has to give up a pawn with 16. … nd7 strong enough, one would think, but again i missed a stronger move: 17. … bc3! i was fixated on the possible bishop sac on h6. i gotta say, it felt pretty good to play this move. i haven't played anything so pretty in a long time! 
-------------------------------------
what can i say? i am a fan of my indian systems. i particularly like the nimzo-indian defense for black. i have spent time studying over-the-board games for many years and indian systems make for a more dynamic game for both sides. i believe this variation is known as the hübner variation, but i could be wrong. someone pleas e confirm whether this is correct or not. quickly goes to the main line at this point. usually white's pawn structure is weakened at this point by doubling or tripling. like i said though, this opening is quite interesting in where it leads. i thought this was a weak response on my part but the board is completely even at this point...interesting. applying pressure on g2, easily defended by several options. trying to find a weakness in white's development, but this was difficult. this is why i worried about my h6 move earlier. in case of this kind of attack, i don't have any protection for it after g6 until later in the game. but nothing attacking it now so this is black's move of choice. ! - a solid response. this attacks the f-line pawn and the weakened h6 pawn. i considered several options here: 1) defending with the queen - qf8, preventing further attacks on that line, but i think i lose tempo 2) g5?? - while this option may look appealing, after 24) ... g5 25) bxg5! hxg5 26) qxg5+! kf8 27) rh3 f6 28) qg4 ... i'm not really liking this for black. the kingside is completely destroyed, which leaves me with a losing position. this leads to another option which i eventually chose... the king protects both pawns and is defended enough to move here so i didn't feel as uncomfortable with it. i looked at every possible outcome that i could as my time was running low (2 min per move doesn't leave me much time to think) of the 2 minutes, i used 1 min 58 seconds coming up with this response. white continues to try to apply pressure to a weak pawn but this is why i liked my king move best! a defender to the rescue! leading white to go try his luck elsewhere. with all the attacks neutralized, figured this is a good time to attack. though mine isn't as strong at the moment... i like games where i can make my opponent play without his queen. though had white taken i probably would be at high risk for a drawish position, possibly losing later without it as i don't currently have any sort of attack for the kingside due to the weak side bishop defending that area pretty well. was my best option i thought. pushing the pawn certainly doesn't help me. defend by advancing! i love it. a forced trade here. after this i offered a draw, to which my opponent decided no. ! - an interesting position. was thinking white would give up the rook and attack the weakened pawns. going here i was thinking rxa6 would follow then i'd go hxg2. leading to rg3 rgf8 h3 rf7 rxc6 rxc6 (the sacrifice i foresaw earlier). was quite surprised to see this, but seeing how the game was going, i guess i shouldn't be. ?! - i was looking at 2 decisions here. if white took with bishop, qxd4+! ke2 bf3+ kf1 qe3 rc2 bg2+ rxg2 qc1+ kf2 qxc5+ giving me an edge in attacking. the other option isn't as strong, but leaves me up a pawn: rxb8 rxb8 d5 bxd5! qa1 rg8 qf6 rg6 qh4+ rh6 qe7+ qxe7 bxe7 and playing an endgame scenario from here. ? - would never have thought to see this move...interesting. kind of ruins both plans now. here i got offered a draw, to which i declined. finally i have a good enough position where i have a plan! first check of the game lol so far so good. now he wants my queen lol ...but i got other plans for it ? - interesting that he let me advance the pawn. i was thinking of sacrificing the queen, gaining a rook and retaking the queen later, but this seemed like a more feasible end game. better safe than sorry. ?? - wow a horrible blunder and i immediately recognized the mate in 4 from here. i know the pawn looks free but a horrible mistake in such a great game. how unfortunate such a great game got ruined for 2 reasons: 1 - use of a computer program by my opponent (he admitted to me privately after our 2nd game) and 2 - this horrible, preventable mate. must've turned the program off or something glitched in it lol 
-------------------------------------
here i'm playing white on a philidor defense. ? bad move, forcing the lost of a pawn or the bishop. black entering into a risky game. if black does 4.dxe5 then 5.qxd8+ kxd8 6.nxe5 and black lose a pawn. blackburne played a gambit on this variation with good results: 4.nc6 5.exd6 bxd6. giving him some tempo for a lost of the pawn.  black chose to lose his bishop. bishops are better than knight in most of the end games that's why larsker said to play knights before to play bishops. well right now i play the same opening that morphy used in his well-known opera game. the position of white is pretty nice, threatening qf7, and is better developed than black.  i think the best position for black is qf6, asking for an exchange of queens. the queen is bad placed here because he blocks the way of his bishop; black will have to lose tempo if he wants to castle on the king side or develop his rook. it's quite obvious now that black gonna try to castle on his queen side. well here i had a lot of choice. i didn't want to go to qb3 because white could have done qb4+ and forcing the trade of queens. nc3 would have been fine but it would have blocked the way for my queen if i wanted to attack on the queen side. bg5 would have been too slow, i think. my main concern right now was to block the castling of white on the queen side, that's why i have castled right now. if black does nc6 instead of nd7, i would get a great advantage. pinning the knight and forcing the queen to stay at e7. ! well done. now my rook can't take possession of the d line. if black castle, then i can take the f pawn. now my queen gonna be ready to enter in the battlefield.  computer analysis: best: +1.58 » 9. nc3 o-o-o 10. rfd1 h6 11. be3 qb4 12. qe2 kb8 13. a3 qe7 14. b4 qe8 15. nb5 c5 16. bd3  this move was almost forced if black doesn't wanted to lose a pawn or the d line. now my position is pretty nice!  ?? huge lost of tempo. black was probably thinking about to do b5 after that. ?! i don't remember why i have done this move loll. i think it was to have a more accurate attack and to force the queen to not go on the d line.  computer analysis:mistake: +1.84 » 11. rfd1 c6 12. bxf6 qxf6 13. na4 rb8 14. qh3 nc5 15. nxb6 bd6 16. nc8 nxe4 17. bxf7+ kxf7 18. nxd6+ nxd6 19. qd7+ qe7 20. rxd6 rxb2 21. qxc6 best: +3.71 » 11. nd5 qc5 12. nxf6+ gxf6 13. bxf7+ kd8 14. rfd1 bd6 15. bh6 kc8 16. be6 rd8 17. bg8 a5 18. a4 bf8 19. bxf8 nxf8  not sure if it was the best move here. now i'm ready to enter the battlefield! threatening both the queen and c7. ! best move to do! if 12.qc5 then 13.nc7+ qxc7 14.bf7+ ke7 15.qe6#. !! qf3 and qh3 could have been fine, but it would have given the option to black to do rxd5. my goal was to take the queen or the king! if black take the bishop in his next move, it will mean the lost of his queen. the sac is sound if white play accurately. the best defense here was 13.rd7! then 14.bxf6!, entering into wild variations, with advantage to white. - ex1:14.bxf6 nxb3 15.nxc7+ kd8 16.bxe7+ bxe7 17.rxd7+ kc8 18.axb3 axb5 19.rxe7 kd8 20.rxf7 then ra8#  - ex2:14.bxf6 axb5 15.qa3! qd6 16.qa8 rd8 17.nxc7+ qxc7 18.qxd8+ qxd8 19.rxd8#  - ex3:14.bxf6 gxf6 15.bxd7+ qxd7 16.nxe6+ ke7 17.rxd7+ nxd7  - computer analysis:best: +6.30 » … rd7 14. bxf6 axb5 15. qa3 gxf6 16. nxe7 rxd1+ 17. rxd1 kxe7 18. qa8 bg7 19. qc6 rd8 20. qxc7+ rd7 21. rxd7+ nxd7 22. qc8 kd6      computer analysis: best: +9.87 » 15. nxc7+ ke7 16. rxd7+ rxd7 17. nd5+ rxd5 18. exd5 ncd7 19. bxf6+ nxf6 20. qb4+ ke8 21. qxb6 nd7 22. qc6 ke7 23. rd1 ke8 24. qc8+ ke7         black lose his queen. threathening the rook and taking pawns. thinking to do b4 on next move. if 19.b4 rxf6 20.bxc5 c6 21.qe2 and black have a better position. 19.rxd7 nxd7 lead to nothing. ! well done. the queen must retreat. not sure if it was the best move here but anyway, i don't see how black find a win in this situation. no choice to take. ! getting out of the reach of the knight and advancing. maybe re6 would have been more accurate, but the rook would have lost some mobility. now i've got a nice pawn structure. moved to c3 to protect it from the rook and to avoid nd4. thinking to do f6. 27.rd1+ 28.kg2 rd2+ 29kh3 would have only helped me to win faster!  ? bad move. black can't take it back because i will take his rook. ? bad move again. ke8 was the only good solution. black have now the choice to lose his knight or to be mated. he decide to be mated! :p well it was a nice game.

this is the budapest defence (or budapest gambit, as it is also known). it was discovered in 1916 by szigmond barasz, a strong hungarian master, and gained (chess)world fame a few years later by featuring in two black wins against rubinstein, regarded as possibly the strongest tournament player in the world at the time.  in february 1924 hans kmoch, a famous theoretician and chess critic, wrote this obituary on the defence: "a counterattack that surfaced a few years ago, and quickly faded away. the sacrifice of a pawn or piece for an advantageous position proved too much of a handicap for almost any player. even for someone as gifted as lasker, who should find such a method ideal, it unmasked itself as illogical, inopportune and unfavorable."  semmering, march 1926, kmoch - reti: 1.d4 nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 ng4 4.e4 nxe5 5.f4 nec6 6.a3 a5 7.be3 na6 8.nf3  bc5 9.qd2 d6 10.nc3 o-o 11.bd3 bxe3 12.qxe3 nc5 13.o-o re8 14.bc2 a4 15. rae1 f6 16.qf2 bg4 17.nd4 qd7 18.nxc6 bxc6 19.f5 bh5 20.qh4 bf7 21.rf3 re5 22.ree3 bxc4 23.rh3 h6 24.reg3 kf8 25.rg6 rae8 26.rhg3 qxf5 27.rxf6+ qxf6  28.rf3 r8e6 29.nxa4 nxa4 30.bxa4 rxe4 31.rxf6+ rxf6 32.g4 be2! 0-1  black is sacrificing a pawn (and, possibly, his own kingside structure) in return for development, lines, and the dissolution of white's center. the rubinstein line. possibly white's best attempt at a refutation of the budapest. black commonly plays either the stolid 4...nc6, with something approaching equality, or goes for razor-sharp and occasionally rather wild complications with the outlandish 4...g5!? opinions differ as to whether this move is correct and playable or pure harakiri. but kmoch is right about one thing: with this move, black has burned his bridges. if he succeeds in this attack, he will probably win; if not, he will almost certainly loose. draw is an outlandish result now! white has to decide what to do with his bishop now. the game move is the stronger option; on 5.bd2 black can play 5...nxe5 with a good game. this exposes the real point of the gambit: black gains control of the powerful long diagonal and threatens the imminent recapture of the sacrificed pawn. the whole idea behind 2.e5 is not, as could otherwise be supposed, to quickly develop the bishop. but simply to break up white's pawn center and force him to defend the ensuing wreckage. attacking with the h-pawn straight away would be premature: 6.h4 nxe5 7.e3 g4 is quite ok for black. on f3 the knight is well posted to take part in the action. a line first proposed by istván abonyi, another strong hungarian master who did significant work analyzing and promoting this opening. on the face of it, white's position isn't so good here: the e-pawn is doomed, and with it much of his center influence, and the bishop on g7 exerts a monstrous influence on the game. but if you take a closer look at black's position, there is cause for concern there as well. primarily there is the question: where do i place the king, longer-term? will it be safe to castle short? will i even be able to wait with castling until i can castle long? these are the undecided questions which will likely decide the fate of the game - unless white stumbles in the opening. and this is the critical line. white attempts to spike black's k-side initiative, rob him of his space advantage there and get rid of the sheltering g-pawn. while black is focused on gaining lines and influence in the center. the e-pawn is doomed, but the fate of the g-pawn hangs in balance. while the g-pawn is alive, black will likely have the advantage. with the g-pawn gone, he will have sacrificed his king-side structure along with the pawn; a much more dubious sacrifice in the longer term. many players will thus prefer the more quiet, long-term advantages of 4...nc6 instead. so far, so good. black has regained the sacrificed material, has uncontested control of the long diagonal, is ahead in development, and has acute, tactical threats. against this weighs the irreparable damage to his kingside structure. as long as he can keep the initiative, he will probably be fine. but how will white respond? it is difficult to find an improvement for white here. on 10.nc3 black would likely capture the knight, saddling white with an isolated, doubled pawn. and of course, the b2 pawn has to be protected or the rook will fall after bxb2. the only move. leaving the pawn on g5, or capturing the h-pawn, leaves black's k-side in shambles and virtually guarantees white good play. but with the g-pawn advanced like this, black keeps up the pressure against white's k-side while gaining valuable space. or 11.f4 bg7 12.e4 d6 13.f5 qe7 and black has good play against white's weaknesses. on 11.f3 black would respond 11...bg3+ 12.kd1 d6 with advantage. there are many good things to say about this move: it adds real strength to black's pressure on the long diagonal, it mobilizes a powerful piece, and it summons the specter of direct threats against f2. additionally, it helps prepare black castling long. in contrast to this, i rather misliked black's position after 11...f5 12.e4 d6 13.bd3 qf6 as white has the powerful 14.nb5! a theme also available to white after 11...d6 12.0-0-0 qf6. i did however, for some time, consider lines after 11...c6!?. but after 12.0-0-0 qf6 13.ne4 qf5 14.nd6+ bxd6 15.qxd6 qe6 16.qxe6 dxe6 black is behind in development and will be lucky to claim equality. this is somewhat passive. i had expected 12.nd5 with approximately equal play after 12...qd6 13.f4 (unclear is 13.0-0-0!? c6 14.nc3 qxd2+ 15.rxd2 bxc3 16.bxc3 with eg. 16...b6 17.e4 ba6 18.h5 0-0-0 and i think white may be slightly better) 13...gxf3 14.exf3 bg3+ 15.kd1 c6 16.ne3 qxd2+ 17.kxd2 d6.  !? and black is forcing a potentially dangerous rupture of white's kingside. i thought at the time that 13.f3 was a no-go. however, it turns out to be surprisingly hard to take advantage of what ought to be a drastic weakening of white's kingside. the problem: white is ahead in piece development. thus eg. 13.f3 bf4 14.e3 qe5 15.ne4! and black has nothing to show for his troubles as 15...bxe3 16.qxe3 f5 17.bd3 fxe4 18.bxe4 does not even give black equality. i am rather proud of this little trick, and i am pretty sure white had overlooked this. the queen is endangered, but ... white has to react to the check and cannot take the queen. and meanwhile that intrepid, little pawn is wreaking havoc on his structure! netting black a pawn. but the material is rather inconsequential here; what's important is black's total control of the long diagonal - and the glaring weakness of c3, which white *has* to keep under guard in order to avoid all kinds of fatalities now. an unreal - and amazingly strong - parking spot for the bishop! much worse is 15... bd4 as 16.e3 forces the bishop away and winning white an important tempo. however, also good is 15...bd5 16.ne4! (not 16.ng4?! bg3+ 17.kd1 qf4 and black is actually better) 16...qg6!? with good play. eg.: 17.nc5 b6 18.qe3 f6 19.nd3 0-0 i had expected 16.ne4 after which 16...qe5 17.qe3 bd4 18.qf3 d5! (with the idea bc8-f5) gives black a clear advantage. nor do more quiet alternatives, like 16.e4 or 16.ng4, afford black any problems. eg.: 16.ng4 qe6 17.qe3 d6 18.qxe6+ bxe6 with good play for black. the game move, though it helps to develop the bishop, turns out to be a dangerous weakening of white's king side. with the g-pawn advanced like this. white's king has no real safety anywhere on the board any more. i am not totally convinced this was best. but trying to fianchetto the bishop to b7 would do nothing but bring about an exchange, so i reason that it has to get out this way. and also, if b7 falls then the b-file will open and that could well prove very dangerous for white. to be completely honest, this move was partly a miscalculation. i had overlooked the real strength behind white's rather obvious reply to my 18th move: 19.qd3! the problem: i have no real way of reinforcing the bishop, which means i either have to retreat to f6 (wasting time and blocking the g-file) or capture on e4. before playing these moves i had taken a good, long move on the critical alternative: 18.bxb7 rb8 19.bc6+ kd8 20.be4. black is a pawn down here, but the open b-file is more than enough compensation: 20...rb1+ 21.rc1 bc3! and white is lost. it is worth noting that white cannot castle his way out of his current problems: 18.0-0 0-0-0 19.ne4 qd4+ and white has nothing to show for the pawn. eg.: 20.qxd4 bxd4 21.kh2 bg6. quite strong! the point here is that black is virtually forced to either block the g-file or lose the bishop pair. after 19...bxe4?! 20.qxe4+ qe5 21.qxh7 qxg3 22.qd3 black's advantage is hard to see.  less good is 19.bxf5 qxf5 20.qe3+ be5 and white's troubles are hardless less than in the game line.  the greedy 19.bxb7 rb7 20.bc60 kd8 still gives black a mortally dangerous open b-file for a measly pawn, and white has no real defence against it. eg.: 21.rc1 bb2 22,rd1 bc3 and white is lost. or 21.be4 rb1+ and 22.nd1 fails to the prosaic 22...bxe4. gk prefers the line 20.c5 d5 21.qxd5 bc3+ 22.kf1c6 23.qd6 rd8 where white has regained the pawn but is still clearly the worse due to black's powerful bishop pair and much healthier pawn structure.  personally i was more concerned about 20.h5?! where i needed to make sure white couldn't force a win with his h- and g-pawns. but black turns out to be all right however, after 20...bxe4 21.qxe4+ be5 (21...qe5 may be even better) 22.qxh7 0-0-0 23.g4 bg3 24.e3 rxg4.  20.bxg6 qxg6 21.qxg6 fxg6 leaves black with a slight but clear advantage due white's pawn weaknesses.  regroups the bishop and effectively blockades the g-pawn, pawing the way for direct mating attacks on white's king. for instance, 21.bf3 leads to a straight mate after 21...rxg3+ 22.kh2 qxh4+ 23.nh3 qxh3++.  a fatal mistake in a difficult position. after 21.bxh7 rg7 22.ne4 white might have been able to hold (eg. 22...qd4+ 23.kh1 o-o-o with black advantage, but white's position is not impossible any more). and white resigned. there is no defence.  a. 22.bxb7 rxg3 23.qxg3 qxh4+ 23.nh3 (23.bc6+ ke7 24.qe4 rg4+ 25.qxe5+ qxe5+ 26.kh1 rxh4+ 27.kg2 qh2++) 23...qxg3+ 24.kh1 qh2++  b. 22.bxh7 rxg3 23.qe4 rg4+ 24.qxe5+ qxe5+ etc.  c. 22.ng4 qxf1 23.nxe5 dxe5 and black is a full rook ahead and is still threatening mate. 
-------------------------------------
a little less common -- but in my opinion, often a little stronger -- than qxd5. white can try to hang on to the extra pawn for a while with 3. c4, but this opens lines and aims for development over material. now, c4 grabs a good amount of space in the center, and allows white to continue with a little initiative in the opening. this is fine, as is nf6, or even nb4. ?! i don't love this move, as it blocks the light-squared bishop and the queen in, and basically commits black to moving this knight a second time in short order. but there's an even bigger problem, that white overlooks. ? missing the way to capitalize on black's mistake last move. c5! traps the nb6, winning a piece. those of you who ever have a chance to play me at blitz chess will notice that my quality of play plummets precipitously; this is one small example. perhaps seeing the danger before white does; this move saves the knight. white still has a little edge, though. played immediately. in a non-blitz situation, i would've looked to see if moves like be3 or bf4 were better; in blitz i jump on the chance to move the king to a slightly worse square. lasker's old saying, “when you see a good move, look for a better one” wasn't meant for games this fast! threatening to simply win the nc5. ?! a little surprising. i was expecting a move like e6, defending the knight while opening a line for the bf8. now the e-pawn is blocked, and the bishop will take some time to resuscitate. in the meantime... an easily parried threat, but in faster games, it's a lot easier to be on the offensive than on the defensive. black's options don't look great at this point: nd7 blocks in the other bishop, too, bd7 loses a piece (and maybe more) to c5, and king moves have their own problems (e.g., 10. ...kf8 11. c5 nd7 12. bf5, with ne5 looming). ?! also not good. there isn't a lot of safety to be found on the queenside. white has some pretty strong continuations. the best way to attack! black has only two options, and one (11. ...kc6 12. ne5#) is out of the question. white would love to play bf4+ as a follow-up, but currently the ne6 guards the f4 square. so why not play a diverting sacrifice? black isn't obligated to take, of course, but a move like this sure is tempting! ? the final mistake. something like nxc4 offered much more resistance. now the house comes down. i've got a looooong way to go before i'm at all passable at faster games, but i have a feeling that with games like this, i'm on the right track! 
-------------------------------------
weak, maybe. the fianchetto is a slow plan for the black's lsb, but it is coherent. the discovered threat against the black knight is ok, but not enough for me... well, if he leaves me, i develop attacking. just an oversight by him. provided g6 traps my bishop, and bxg6, fxb, qxg6, nmoves and it's ok for me, but not decisive, i tried a crazy sac (it was an over the board blitz) as wrong sac, since the knight retires and nothing happens. now, qxd6 is tricky, but i have my 3 pawns for the piece. but no attack anymore.  consolidating for o-o-o and bring more firepower to the lines.  now i can play ne4. but i was lost, anyway. c5... well, this threats with a queen exchange that leaves me with a long, long game... so why don't try the crazy way?  if qf7, qd8, but it was not that strong.  another "crazy" attack move, just looking for something (f6 fork, for instance) uuuuupppssss, right! rf8 and it forces queen's exchange, and my attack vanishes. nice.  my queen is trapped.  aiming at nothing, overlooking the danger.  touché! minus 4. wonderful. time to consolidate. maybe better was h4, and if bxh4, g5 or bg1.  strong, threatening the diagonal fork.  just a stupid move: bg4, and i cannot avoid exchanges and losing.  a little help by my opponent.  jeje... by moving the queen, i would have be driven into defensive mood... and losing.  yahoooooooo! well, now rd8, since i cannot advance the pawn without losing a night... attack produces fear. a very unpolite way to win at chess (don't try it with computers).  i have to stop nf5, and try to clear the white diagonal as soon as possible.  probably better rg1, or e6 at once.  black could have played returning the queen, with nxbg3, exq, nxr... may as well try the trick. piece returned, and material balance almost restored. but what a pawn's line! forgive them, father, since they don't know what they are doing... and resigned. incredibly enough, i won this one...

1. e4 e5 2. nf3 d6 3. c4 defensa philidor. negras ganan 24% esta respuesta no está tabulada. rompo la estrategia. lo más jugado es 3.d4 aquí bajo mi opinión negro comete un error básico que es jugar varias veces con la misma pieza: 13. ... qd7 14. ... qb5 15. ... qb4. luego en 17 y 18 sigue moviendo la reina, pero para entonces blanco ha invadido ya el terreno de las negras moviendo el resto de fichas. aquí empieza el desastre. la reina y el caballo negros en línea.  llevando el caballo a nf3 , después de ahí, cualquier movimiento del caballo lo dejaba en línea con la reina ( nd2 o nd4 ) y por tanto a tiro de torre. quizás lo mejor era haber hecho qe2.  
-------------------------------------
the kings indian, sämisch ... i love to play this with both white and black, because it has a great offer of different strategies. and as always in a kings indian, initiative is paramount. so far we have followed theory, but this move i can´t find anywhere in the books or databases. and in combination with long castling it doesn´t look sound. the queen will come under fire, giving black some valuable tempi, as we shall see. of course it is too dangerous to grab the pawn on b5. the white rook comes into action for the defence, but look a the positions of the two kings. white´s only have one pawn for cover, while black´s can sleep peacefully. defending the knight, and threatening qb6-qb4 with more power in the attack. a very natural response, but this is a crucial moment. white´s bishop on f1 is out of the game, and so is rh1. the two knights are more or less away from where the action is, so it wasn´t too dificult to find the sacrifice of a piece to open the lines for black´s bishops. a "zwischenzug" to put the white queen on a less favorable square, since the black knight on a5 wins a tempo going to b3 later. 24. nxa2, qxb2  25. qxb2, rxb2  and black wins decisive material after either 26. ka1 or 26. kc1. only move. 26. bxc3 is mate after nc1  and qb1  followed by qb3 mate. ?? - but 28. bxc3 is no better: 28 -, nd4! (threatening ra8#) 29. bc1 (only move), ra8  30. ba3, nc2 and curtains. of course white should just resign, but even chess-players believe in miracles ... everything wins, but i had hoped for the cute alternative: 31. ba3, c4! - when white can´t do anything against 32. -, rb3 and 33. -, raxa3 mate. white resigns, but i would like to thank my opponent for many great games during the time on gameknot - and thanks to the inventor of the kings indian!

hasta aquí todo lo habitual de una siciliana - najdorf variante escogida por casi todo el mundo y a la espera de la sexta jugada blanca donde tiene multitud de opciones para jugar. jr escoge be2 por primera vez en nuestros enfrentamientos. supongo que quiere cambiar bg5¡ porque no le había dado buenos resultados contra mi. después de para mi la novedosa be2 (novedosa en el sentido de poco utilizada por jr) podía optar por e6 ó e5. aprovechando algunos estudios de partidas de remco (nestorix) me decido por e5. pienso que el centro queda bastante más bloqueado y no tengo que olvidar que juego con negras y ante un buen estratega josé ramón disfruta de cada partida independientemente de donde esté enmarcada. mirando la clasificación del acpro's minit, jr tiene (tenía) posibilidades de ganar el torneo, sobre todo observando su magnifica partida en curso con nestorix y en base a ello pensaba que arriesgaría para ganar pero no....... simplemente disfruta con su idea y el torneo le importa un ...... digo todo esto por que jugando con blancas está muy conservador porque esperaba be3 ahora?????.  porque no f5¡ o incluso g4¡ no es batalla lo que vamos a tener. ahora las críticas se deben volver contra mi..... soy un 'cagueta' contra las sicilianas. no es mi medio, no estoy comodo, no domino su estructura y desemboco habitualmente en finales perdedores. los que leais esto entendereis porque no me atreví a 12.- bc4, b6 o incluso exf4.  me decido por esta, ignorando bc4 de nuevo porque la posición que tomara la torre blanca de la columna f, me parece poco natural e incomoda. hasta aquí mi amigo y yo no hemos aportado nada, salvo quizá nuestros miedos.... todo esto se ha jugado. ahora debo ser fiel a la idea de mi jugada 13. si la torre no parece comoda en f4 tampoco debe estar mejor en f5. prepara d5, libera el centro, incomoda a la torre y deja espacio para el alfil que algún dia llegara a f6-g7. jr es bueno.... y si me deja nd3 a huevo para perder calidad su razón tendrá...... supongo que el calculó lo siguiente --> qxd3¡¡ qxf4 --- e5 ng4 ---- bxg4 qxg4 nxd5¡¡ qf5..... y la calidad está compensada por ataque y el centro negro está hecho añicos. quizá podría haberlo jugado por probar, pero insisto que la siciliana no es mi mejor performance.

  aquí debe venir el grueso del comentario. la partida parece tablas ya que se prepara una masacre como la que expongo a continuación... o quizás las blancas tenían posibilidades?

hi everyone!  i have another game to annotate.  this time it is a player who had a class d rating but, after putting himself under the wing of cyrano the great, overall mentor of group d, he has come on in leaps and bounds.  his name is jellycake (john).  in this game he gave me a run for my money and material was even until the endgame, when he left a pawn en prise.  that was the only material he left en prise.  the rest of his game was absolutely solid.  alas for john, that one little pawn proved decisive and he ended up sacrificing his rook to prevent glenda from making an appearance.  however, k & r v bare king was just the minimum amount of material i needed to force checkmate.  after careful analysis, i was able to demonstrate to john how this checkmate could be brought about.  john then resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate.  so, how did this come about?  well, read on ........ 4. ...... a6 - allo, allo, allo - this is the naijdorf variation of the sicilian defense (the sicilian is characterised by 1. e4 c5).  it is very popular and gary kasparov virtually became world champ after using this defense as black. 6. ...... bxc6 - john chooses to strengthen his centre.  on the minus side he leaves himself with an isolated pawn.  this will tell later on. 8. 0-0 - both sides get their pieces out very quickly and now i decided to put henry on the kingside.  not the usual cut and thrust of the dragon or naijdorf when both sides attack each other's kings on opposite wings! 9. bd2 - to avoid bxn busting up my kingside pawns. 12. ..... cxd5 - this plethora of exchanges leads to a doubleton on black's d column.  is this an asset or a liability?  in this case, it will turn out to be the latter. 14. qa3 - glenda prevents the bk from castling kingside. 15. .... kxe7 - queen trade. 17. .... kxe6 - pawn trade.  this trade brings the bk out into the centre.  he is safe there as the queens are off the board and although both sides have their two rooks, there is only one set of minor pieces on the board, fou leblanc and his opposite number. 20. bf1 - no real advantage here but an awful lot of scratching around by yours truly. 22. ...... axb5 - this bishop trade leaves my a pawn vulnerable to castle fire. 24. rd3 - pin. 25. ..... f6? this loses a pawn due to the pin on the d4 pawn. 28. rd7 - i am a pawn up, i attack black's kingside with a bone in the throat, but that is easy for john to defend.  bit stuck here. 30. rb7 - still scratching around! 31. ..... rxb8 - one pair of rooks is traded off.  at least his remaining rook could be made passive provided that i can get henry over to the queenside and relieve the rook of defending my own queenside pawns.  i just do not want henry to be accosted by john's rook any more than i can help it. 34. rc1 - at least i can now take control of the c column and if john's rook attacks my a pawn, rc2 will cut the mustard. 37. ..... rb8 - john wisely eschews exchanging off his final rook as he will not want me to distract his king over to the queenside while henry moves over to the kingside where three juicy p(r)awns await his consumption! 40. kxa3 - but as a result of this trade i do now have a passer and it is this pawn that will sound the death knell for the bk. 42. b4 - passed pawns must be pushed! 44. g3 - in order to halt the advance of the f pawn.  if the f pawn does try to make progress, i will trade it off for my g pawn.  while henry guards my a pawn, my rook will stop the bk from gloming my h pawn. 45. ...... kxf4 - the trade now takes place. 48. rh5 - as i said in my previous note, the situation has come to pass.  there is no way i will allow the bk to take my h pawn.  my rook's next plan is to shift up one rank to allow my passer to move to the 6th rank. 49. ..... kxg3 - the kingside pawns are finally traded off and there is just my b pawn left.  there is a real race against the clock.  can i get my passer to safety before the rook and the bk get him?  we shall see! 50. ..... kg4 - by staying on the g column, black loses a vital tempo.  on the next turn my pawn is just two squares from glendadom. 53. kc5 - i think i am winning the race - just!  at least, unless i blunder my rook, john cannot win.  i certainly want to avoid conceding a low draw though! 55. b7 - henry will move to c6 next move, shutting out the bk and i will then move my rook to c8 forcing john to allow glenda to return to the board with a vengeance.  however ....... 55. ...... rxb7 - ..... he sacs his rook for the pawn!  unfortunately for john, it is still a loser, although it will take a lot longer to deliver the coup de grace.  john wanted to play on because he was curious to see just how mate could be forced by henry and the rook.  we played it out a few more moves, then ...... 57. kd5 - keeping john's king confined to the f column, wait for it ...... 58. rf7+ - forcing john's king back to the g column, wait for it ..... 61. ke5 - now!!  here, after some very careful analysis i announced #13.  here is the mate but if you can find a quicker one please do not hesitate to provide me with answers on a postcard.  variation a 61. … kg3 62. ke4 kg2 63. ke3 kg1 64. ke2 kg2 65. rg8+ kh3 66. kf2 kh4 67. kf3 kh5 68. kf4 kh6 69. kf5 kh7 70. rg1 kh6 71. rg2 kh7 72. kf6 kh8 73. kf7 kh7 74. rh2# variation b 61. … kg3 62. ke4 kg2 63. ke3 kg1 64. ke2 kg2 65. rg8+ kh2 66. kf3 kh1 67. kf2 kh2 68. rh8# variation c: 61. … kg3 62. ke4 kg2 63. ke3 kg1 64. ke2 kg2 65. rg8+ kh1 66. kf2 kh2 67. rh8#.  john agreed with the announcement and resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate.  i may get an even tougher game in my return match against him.  his rating has been coming on in leaps and bounds and only just recently, john overwhelmed a class c 1500+ player in an endgame.  it will be interesting to see how he gets on against the master mater.  anyhow, i hope you have all had a good read.  kind regards - joanne

thematic done what is this oooh -9 well ooh ghost vision darn for white bishop escaped  oof trade white desperately holding on... what um threatening rd8+ oops gaining material  -6 !? ?? well ooh skewered. oh oh no  check slight loss of tempo for white desperate  better would be qxe5! um check! white’s game is resignable but, final hope ? !? boom! awesome sacrifice, but if black declined, white is lost ???? sweet tactics wow forced checkmate!!!!!! 
-------------------------------------

hoy en día esto no se ve tan a menudo, ya que muchos jugadores prefieren optar por variantes más secundarias evitando toda la teoría (que día a día cambia) alternative variation: 3. bb5+ [se está jugando mucho en la élite]  la variante del dragón, que muchos evitan porque el blanco tiene una gran variedad de sistemas peligrosos, en los que directamente se va a por el rey sin importar el material que se entregue. incluso he llegado a escuchar que está refutado, no obstante lo recomiendo para todos aquellos jugadores que busquen posiciones agudas y que quieran buscar la victoria con negras  alternative variation: 9. o-o-o [es la otra línea importante en la posición, pero se suele simplificar mucho el juego] d5 10. exd5 nxd5 11. nxc6 bxc6 12. bd4 [y aquí existen varias alternativas para negras ] (12. nxd5 [esta captura, no entraña demasiado peligro para negras. hay que recordar siempre, que muchas veces, cuando existen enroques opuestos, prima abrir líneas o ganar tiempos en el ataque, que el material] cxd5 13. qxd5 qc7 14. qc5 [es la principal, el blanco quiere cambiar damas ya que tiene material de más y su rey está más expuesto] (14. qxa8 bf5 15. qxf8+ kxf8 $13 [en la teoría se considera esto, juego complicado, pero diría que es más cómodo de jugar con negras]) 14... qb7 15. qa3 bf5 $36 [el desarrollo y la iniciativa compensa de forma clara el peón entregado]) 12... bxd4 (12... nxc3 13. qxc3 bh6+ 14. be3 bxe3+ 15. qxe3 qb6 16. qxe7 be6 $44 [nuevamente el peón es compensado por la iniciativa de las negras]) (12... e5 [es una variante muy arriesgada, en la que normalmente el negro acaba entregando la calidad] 13. bc5 be6 $5 [la entrega es muy interesante, por ello la jugada más utilizada aquí es ne4, sin aceptar el reto]) 13. qxd4 qb6 [con juego equilibrado]  profiláxis necesaria alternative variation: 11. h4 [sería un serio error] nxd4 12. qxd4 ng4 $1 13. qd2 nxe3 14. qxe3 rxc4 $19  esta posición es la más teórica del ataque yugoslavo (9.bc4), históricamente se han intentado varias jugadas, la principal es 12...h5 actualmente, y la más fuerte, pero esto se descubrió con el tiempo  en la actualidad, esta jugada se considera dudosa, aunque parezca muy natural. la cosa está en que el caballo no estaba siendo amenazado en "e5", por lo que ya de entrada, parece una pérdida de tiempo. además la torre en "c4", puede ser objeto de amenaza en algunas variantes alternative variation: 12... h5 [es la principal, y el duelo teórico seguiría]  por desgracia, no pude recordar la importancia de 16.nde2, que se jugó en el candidatos del 74 entre karpov y korchnoi, una partida muy famosa en su época desde la que se consideró un error el sistema de las negras alternative variation: 16. nde2 qa5 17. bh6 bxh6 18. qxh6 rfc8 19. rd3 [aquí está la clave, karpov evita todo tipo de entregas en "c3", además la jugada 16.nde2 ha servido precisamente para reforzar ese punto] r4c5 20. g5 rxg5 21. rd5 rxd5 22. nxd5 re8 23. nef4 bc6 24. e5 bxd5 25. exf6 exf6 26. qxh7+ kf8 27. qh8+ [1-0 karpov,a (2700)-kortschnoj,v (2670)/moscow 1974/candidates]  mi rival consumió bastante tiempo (para tratarse de una partida a 5 finish) para hacer este movimiento, es el mejor con diferencia y aquí empecé a ver las complicaciones que tenía mi posición  temático y fuerte  no sé si por azar (ya que la partida era de ritmo muy rápido), o por cálculo, acierta en el momento clave ya que 20...kg8 perdía alternative variation: 20... kg8 21. g5 nh5 22. rxh5 gxh5 23. rh1 [y ahora la torre no podrá ir a "g7", por ejemplo] qc8 24. rxh5 bf5 25. nxf5 qxf5 26. g6 $1 qxg6 27. rg5 $18  me pareció importante llevar piezas al ataque mi caballo desde aquí por el momento defiende en "c3" y "amenaza" saltar a "f4" desde donde participará mejor en la ofensiva  no es la más precisa alternative variation: 23... ne8 [ hubiese sido mucho mejor, la posición es muy compleja, ya que el negro tiene dos peones por la calidad y una posición muy sólida. sin embargo su torre está atada en "g7" para defender "h7"]  es normal que en una rápida se opte por esto, ya que parece más activo (primar actividad antes que material como antes hemos dicho).  es mejor ceder la calidad y crear otras debilidades, que intentar conservarla, ya que las negras en ningún caso estarían peor, y tendrían una iniciativa muy molesta alternative variation: 27. re3 qa3+ [buena jugada, primero llevamos al rey a una casilla más activa, y después capturamos en "a2"] 28. kd2 qxa2 $15 [ganando un tercer peón, esto lo valoré en la partida, pero me veía muy mal]  en realidad, el último momento en el que había que acertar, las tablas se firmaron rápido  alternative variation: [pero no] 31. kc1 qg1+ 32. kb2 qxg6 $19  empate justo, la lección más importante que se puede aprender de esta partida, es que en las posiciones de corte dinámico, normalmente hay que darle más importancia a la iniciativa que al material

mais uma vez, a variante "malvada" da defesa dos dois cavalos defesa dos dois cavalos, de novo vamos para o clássico... de novo! só que agora, com um adversário bem mais forte... belo lance, que busca trazer as peças brancas o quanto antes para o jogo. as negras perdem um tempo retomando o peão... evita o xeque de torre... procura abrir a coluna da torre, o que é considerado a melhor saída para as peças brancas, as negras simplesmente ignoram este lance... eis o porque, a dama branca continua no seu desterro... parece que agora a dama branca vai escapar... mas... ataca o cavalo... continua mantendo a dama branca presa! agora a ameça é kd7 ganhando a dama! ataca o cavalo em d6, tentando escapar... agora, a ameça é simplesmente bb7... a dama branca está perdida, de novo! a vantagem material é mais ou menos equivalente, mas a posição de algumas peças brancas é bem mais agressiva, especialmente a dupla cavalo bispo... evita um descoberto na torre... ataca o peão em a7, ao mesmo tempo que defende o cavalo branco em d6, que não pode ser tomado... por se tratar de um adversário muito mais forte, o empate é proposto pelas negras, que aproveitam o susto que as brancas levaram para ganhar mais uma boa quantidade de pontos de rating! as brancas aceitam! 
-------------------------------------
i start most of my games with e4 or d4, with both moves claiming the center for white. my opponent responds with e5, a move with the same purpose as white's first. i decided to go with the king gambit. it immediately attacks the e5 pawn, but it weakens the e1-h4 diagonal, which can be used by black with a timely qh4+. this opening sacrifices a pawn for fast developpement. black accepts. other moves included d6 and bc4. the main follow up for white. it develops a piece, prevents qh4+ and protects some central squares. !? this is new to me. it attacks my currently unprotected e4 pawn, and it allows to develop the light squared bishop. this is called the abbazia defense. i take his pawn. i believe that nf6, attacking the d pawn once more, is slightly better. it avoids the following move by white. i develop my queenside knight while gaining a tempi on his queen. the best square for the queen. it can't be attacked soon, and it doesn't hinder black's developpement. the idea is similar to the scandinavian defense. (1. e4 d5!? 2. exd5 qxd5 3. nc3 qa5) logical. it frees my dark squared bishop and controls some important central squares. it also pins my own knight to the king though. simple developpement, and protecting black's f4 pawn. i unpin my knight while threatening a discovered attack on his queen. my opponent retreats his queen while attacking my b2 and d4 pawns. i ignore my b2 pawn, and opt to develop my other bishop while aiming at the weak f7 square. it also prepare kingside castling. my b2 pawn is somewhat poisonous after 8. bc4 qxb2?! 9. rb1 qa3. (the black queen is misplaced) ?! although this move seems good, it is not. gk thinks this is a mistake. it pins my knight, which could be annoying. however, some pins can be converted into discovered attack... mistake: +2.13 » … bg4 8. na4 bxf3 9. qxf3 qxd4 10. qxb7 qxc4 11. qxa8 c6 12. qxa7 qxc2 13. rf1 best: +0.91 » … be6 8. qe2 ne7 9. bxe6 fxe6 10. o-o-o nbc6 11. rhe1 nd8 12. ng5 o-o 13. nxe6 nxe6 14. qxe6+  ?! this move is a blunder, but it is hard to find the correct moves for black in order to refute this sacrifice. anyway, it forces the black king to move, which prevents black from castling.  black takes. the only logical follow-up. i check the black king while attacking his bishop with my queen. ? the king retreats to his original square. however, this is a mistake. the counter-intuitive kg6 was better for black. gk recommend this line:  best: -2.21 » … kg6 10. qxg4 nf6 11. qh4 re8+ 12. kd1 nc6 13. kc1 nxd4 14. nf3 nxf3 15. gxf3 rad8 16. bxf4 bxf4+ 17. qxf4 material is now equal, but i have 4 piece developped against 2 for black and the black king can't castle anymore. i definitely have an advantage here. my opponent develops a piece while protecting his king; not a bad choice. i castle queenside in order to put my king to safety and to put a rook on the promising central files. simple developpement i place my king's rook onto the e file, as it pins the knight to the king. my opponent takes my unprotected d pawn. however, all my pieces are pointing the enemy king, which is stuck in the middle... ! with every pieces ready to attack, it's time to take on black's central fortress. this is the beginning of a great all-out attack. for now, this knight is going to be real pain to black. it forks the queen, the g7 pawn and the c7 pawn. my opponent secures his queen. how to proceed? !? although this is objectively not the best move, it sure packs a punch. i now fork the queen, the e7 knight and the c7 pawn. 15. ... nxd5?! is met by 16. nxc7+! (double check) any k move 17. nxd5, which would furthermore open the black king position. ?? black misses the attack on the queen. i gladly take the material advantage, as the black king is still under heavy pressure. black retakes. ! i get my bishop into play as well as my rook while i take the f4 pawn. ? black attacks my queen, but missed... nxd7+!! this move checks the black king, pins the black knight, forks both rooks and is a sacrifice. i don't see these moves everyday! the knight is immune. if black plays 18. ... bxc7, i respond with 19.qxg8# (the e7 knight is pinned). the same applies for 18. ... rxc7 19. qxg8+ kd7 20. rxd6#. the king has to move. 18. ... kd8 is met by 19. rxd6 kxc7 20. qd7+ kb6 (20. ... kb8 21. rxc6+! ka8 22. rxe7! and mate is unstoppable) 21. rxe7 and white is crushing. black must play either kf8 or kf7. ? unfortunately, kf7 was better for black. i gain a tempo on 18. ... kf7. forced (19. ... rg7 20. qxg7#) i continue my deadly assault on the black king with my queen, supported by my handy rooks. forced ! i capture his bishop and treaten his f6 pawn while leaving my bishop and knight hanging. blacks takes my hanging bishop, but his king is in a mating net... ! (obviously) logical follow up only move (24. ... kh5 25. g4+! kxg4 (25... rxg4 26. qxh6#) 26. rg1+ any k move 27. qh6#) forcing the black king to go to g7 forced ! the best way to continue the attack obviously i capture the knight, with check. black tries to escape. "no way, sir. you are not allowed to escape this way!"  forced, yet again. ! the black king must now go into the 8th file. this and 27. ... kf8 is met by the same move, which is... 1-0  the black king must go to f8, where white would play 29.qf7#.  i hope you liked this great game as i did. please leave comments and rating if you want to, whether they are positive or negative. also thanks to pmehani who played this game until the end too. thanks, a_random_guy 
-------------------------------------
e4 è una delle mosse più logiche per il bianco: occupa il centro e libera lo sviluppo dell'alfiere e della donna.
-------------------------------------
 inoltre poichè l'alfiere che puo' muoversi è quello in f1, e4 è anche un passo di avvicinamento all'arrocco corto.le partite che iniziano con e4 si chiamano in funzione della risposta del nero partite di gioco aperto (se il nero risponde con e5) oppure partite di gioco semi-aperto (se il nero fa qualsiasi mossa diversa da e5).
-------------------------------------
 le partite di gioco aperto sono caratterizzate da un gioco tagliente fin dalle prime mosse per cui è fondamentale completare lo sviluppo in breve tempo e tenere sotto controllo il centro per avere la meglio.
-------------------------------------
  1....e5 è la risposta più naturale ad 1.e4. si oppone all'occupazione del centro e analogamente a quanto fa e4 per il bianco, e5 libera per il nero lo sviluppo dei pezzi alfiere di re e donna. occupare/controllare il centro significa occupare/controllare le quattro case e4,d4,e5,d5; nella battaglia per il centro per capire chi ha la meglio si valutano queste quattro caselle. osservando le 4 case centrali si puo' osservare che il pedone bianco minaccia qualsiasi pezzo del nero che venisse a trovarsi in d5. quindi il bianco occupa e4 e controlla d5. il nero analogamente occupa e5 e controlla d4. la battaglia per il centro al momento è pari. col cavallo in c3 il bianco minaccia due case del centro (e5 e d4) inoltre in previsione di un futuro arrocco su lato del re, il cavallo difende la casa h2 da eventuali attacchi del nero con questa mossa il nero difende il pedone e5 e tiene sotto controllo d4.
-------------------------------------
 questa sembra la risposta più logica per il nero, comunque ci sono anche altre possibilità, ad esempio 2....d6 o 2...nf6.
-------------------------------------
  3.bb5 è la mossa che caratterizza la partita spagnola (o "rui lopez"). l'idea è di attaccare il difensore del pedone e5.
-------------------------------------
 tuttavia la minaccia del bianco è solamente ipotetica, il nero per il momento non ha bisogno di difendere ulteriormente il pedone. infatti se il bianco mangerà il cavallo il nero ha a disposizione un tatticismo per recuperare il pedone.
-------------------------------------
 ora la donna attacca sia il cavallo in e5 che il pedone in e4 (che mangerebbe con scacco) ed è impossibile difendere entrambi] un ottima mossa per il nero. sviluppa il cavallo in una casa perfetta (minaccia e4 e d5, difende h7) e procede verso l'arrocco. il bianco arrocca e non si preoccupa di difendere il pedone e4. se il nero mangerà il pedone (4...nxe4) il bianco potrà sfruttare il vantaggio di sviluppo (il bianco ha già arroccato il nero no) per aprire il gioco con re1 (minacciando il cavallo in e4) e alla mossa successiva si potrà riprendere il pedone. ovviamente in questo caso al nero non mancano le contromosse. ma la partita è andata in un'altra direzione... prepara l'arrocco il bianco sviluppa la torre sulla colonna "e" con un'obiettivo immediato (difendere il pedone e4) ed uno a lungo termine (controllare la colonna nel caso si apra).
-------------------------------------
 ora il nero deve stare attento perchè il pedone in e5 è minacciato:in caso di 6.bxc6, dxc6, 7.nxe5 la risposta 7...qd4 non funziona più perchè dopo 8.nf3 la donna è minacciata (non può mangiare in e4 causa torre in e1) e il pedone non viene più restituito. il nero mette il re al sicuro (ma lascia il pedone e5 al suo destino) il bianco rimuove il difensore di e5.  ...e poi mangia il pedone indifeso. prima di arroccare il nero avrebbe dovuto difendere il pedone e5 il nero minaccia il cavallo bianco.
-------------------------------------
 (non so se questa è una buona mossa; probabilmente no perchè l'alfiere viene mosso per la seconda volta e fa perdere tempo prezioso al nero; era preferibile forse giocare 7.re8, con l'idea di contestare la colonna "e" al bianco fin da subito; inoltre da e8 la torre avrebbe minacciato insieme al cavallo f6 il pedone e5 non appena l'alfiere si fosse spostato da d7) il cavallo torna al sicuro, inoltre poichè l'alfiere nero si è portato in d6, ora è presente la minaccia di 9.e5! con forchetta (il pedone minaccerebbe sia il cavallo che l'alfiere) inchioda il cavallo bianco (infatti se il cavallo si muove c'è bxd1!). questa mossa non è cattiva. solo che in questo momento con la minacca di forchetta del pedone verso e5 bisognava giocare qualcos'altro (mi viene in mente sempre re8). il bianco non vuole infierire subito (9.e5 avrebbe guadagnato un pezzo per un pedone) perchè preferisce occupare il centro con la coppia di pedoni.
-------------------------------------
 in generale una coppia di pedoni in e4, d4 (o in d5,e5 dal p.d.v del nero) sono il sogno di qualsiasi giocatore. se l'avversario non si oppone energicamente, una coppia di pedoni centrali ben sostenuta può fare danni molto gravi alle truppe nemiche.
-------------------------------------
 ma la minaccia di pedone in e5 è sempre presente... il nero non si avvede della minaccia.
-------------------------------------
 era preferibile spostare uno dei due pezzi minacciati: ad esempio 9....bb4 il nero tenta di trovare compenso per la perdita del cavallo minacciando la torre bianca... ...ma è troppo tardi. bisognava intervenire prima il nero ha ceduto un pezzo ma almeno si è ripreso un pedone. è una buona cosa limitare i danni.  volendo essere ancora più precisi, quando capita di subire una forchetta come 10.e5 se non c'è via d'uscita tanto vale usare il pezzo che si decide di cedere per fare più danni possibili.  in questo caso "più danni possibili" era appunto riprendersi almeno un pedone, quindi il nero ha giocato bene. visto che c'era tanto valeva prendersi un pedone di quelli centrali che sono più importanti. quindi a 10.e5 era interessante rispondere 10....bxe5.  il cavallo nero occupa una casa importante.
-------------------------------------
 essendo il cavallo uno di quei pezzi che ha minor gittata (rispetto all'alfiere e alla torre ad esempio), per esprimere il massimo potenziale (ovvero per minacciare più case possibili, cioè 8) è sempre bene che il cavallo sia in una posizione centrale o vicina al centro.diciamo che il cavallo è in una buona posizione quando occupa una delle case comprese nel quadrato formato da c3,f3,c6,f6. 
-------------------------------------
 inoltre il cavallo è il pezzo più adatto per bloccare l'avanzata di un pedone. infatti pur avendo davanti a sè il pedone d4, il cavallo grazie al suo movimento ad l è l'unico pezzo che da quella posizione può minacciare le case di possibili difensori del pedone avversario (ovvero c3 e e3).
-------------------------------------
 quindi se non si sa cosa fare di un cavallo ed è disponibile una casa davanti ad un pedone avversario, può essere una buona idea piazzarlo lì!  toglie la donna da d1 liberando il cavallo in f3 dall'inchiodatura. questa mossa non è chiara. forse il nero voleva difendere l'alfiere? o forse con la donna vuole sostenere l'alfiere per giocare 15....bf4 con minaccia alla donna bianca?
-------------------------------------
 questa mossa di per sè non fa danni al nero. solo che è comunque una mossa debole (in questa posizione) perchè non è necessaria (la casa b5 era già controllata dal pedone c6).
-------------------------------------
 il peccato principale di questa mossa è che aggiunge quasi nulla al gioco del nero (è quasi come se il nero stesse fermo) mentre il bianco ha disposizione una mossa in più per creare iniziativa o acquisire vantaggio.
-------------------------------------
 in questo caso era meglio mettere in gioco le torri, ad esempio con rfe8, oppure con rad8. oppure, guardando attentamente la disposizione dei pezzi del bianco (la donna bianca punta verso h7, il cavallo bianco da f3 può portarsi in g5 aggiungendo una minaccia ulteriore ad h7) era sicuramente importante prevenire un attacco con h6 (che rende impossibile la discesa del cavallo bianco in g5). minaccia la donna nera e il matto in h7.  campanello d'allarme... il nero probabilmente non vede la minaccia di matto e prova a cambiare le donne.
-------------------------------------
my opponent is making an unusual third move. now have both nearly left theory. why? seems like a wasted tempo? i on my side develop in the center. white is aiming towards the h6-square, planning to try to exchange his dark-square bishop against mine dark-square bishop. but i don´t think that is a threat! i want to fianchetto my light-square bishop at b7. moving the rooks towards the center are often good strategy in the middlegame! now it comes. but why not earlier? why not already in move 10? because white commited himself to that already in move 9. no use to wait for it, the same thing when a player makes b3/b6 or g3/g6, it´s mostly best to fianchetto the actual bishop already in the next move. no gain to wait for it! to decentralize the knight is mostly not a good idea.  d5, central breakthrough. had prepared for this move with my last moves. white´s queen try to be dangerous along the a1-h8-diagonal. to defend against this, black can either move out of the pin or even better... d4!!!! this move both threatens the knight at c3 and closes the a1-h8-diagonal! good move! ??? this move will end with the loss of the game! necessary was nce4, even if that move will lose a pawn it would have been much better for white than the text move. now can black destroy the pawn shield in front of white´s king. very bad! this move looks awkward at a first glance, but according to my analysis it was the best move. now it is to late for white. white loses his knight. white gave up. it was hopeless. 
-------------------------------------
well, this game was a very narrow miss.  my opponent, who correctly caught my blunder nearly roasted me.  i thought i was the bread winner, but it turns out i was toast.  burnt, charcoal toast- and with no butter.  i decided to annotate this game as my first- perhaps to hopefully learn to "think" before i move in the future.  i'm still relatively new to chess, so i suspect some of my analysis will be off the mark.  feel free to correct me if i'm wrong, or even if you have a thought, please share; we can both learn together.  at the moment, i favor two openings: king's pawn opening and queen's pawn opening, which i usually hope leads to queen's gambit.  this game, i chose the former. black offers a king's pawn game, which i always like :). i make a standard followup move, which is per the book king's knight opening.  the idea, i suspect, is to threaten to remove his control of the center and gain piece advantage.  i would expect nc6 or d6 to defend, or a counter attack with nf6. but, black surprises me with bd6!?  it's not a move per the book.  perhaps he's playing chess from the hip, or maybe he's trying to throw me off my game with a relatively foreign move?  in hindsight, which is 20/20 they say, i probably should have played 3.d4 exd4 4. nxd4 ... to remove his control of the center and solidify my own. decided to go for some development. he responds with the move i would have expected earlier, but the option to remove his control of the center is still there. 4. d4 with the idea that 4. ... exd4 5. nxd4 nxd4 6. qxd4.  this would remove his control of the center as well as give me one developed piece ahead of him. yep. yep yep. another move i didn't expect.  is he trying to pin my knight to my other knight... maybe he's trying to keep some center control?  i saw this as an opportunity to gain some positional advantage. by 6. nxc6, i was forcing him to react.  he could have 6. ... bxc3, but then i'd have his queen.  he could develop/retreat his queen, but then i could take his bishop (nxe5).  so, naturally, he gets a double pawn, which are always fun to work with. (#sarcasm.) he decided to open the second leftmost file.  not a terrible idea as now his rook at a8 is one move away from activation.  i didn't particularly want a double pawn... ... so, i moved 7. bd2.  according to the computer analysis gameknot provides, this move was a minor mistake because of this line:   7. ... nf6  8. bd3 rb8  9. qc1 o-o  10. o-o d6 11. re1 be6  12. f4 bd4+  13. be3 bxc3  14. bxc3 a5 ...  the nf6, i think, is meant to threaten capture of the center in order to force me to move my knight from c3, so black's bishop can threaten my rook with bxb2 followed with a rb8.  i can see the necessity of bd3 because of this.  however, in response to rb8, which threatens rxb2, i'd either move my own rook to guard b2 or i'd move my pawn (f4) to threaten his bishop which is kinda the crux of the problem anyways??  am i missing something?  then, if he takes my knight (bxc3), i take bxc3 and the threat to my rook is gone.  if, instead, he presses the issue with bd4, i can do e5, threatening his newly developed knight, which can either retreat (and he loses development), or he can move nd5, where i nxd5.  from there, if he goes bxb2, i simply rb2, pinning his bishop to his rook.  if he takes my knight instead (cxd5), then i can move my pawn (c3) and the threat is once again dispelled.  i didn't see all this mid-game, but i think bd2 is actually just fine. well, anyways... *ahem  black threatens to remove my center control.  8. exd5 would give him the center. fortunately, i saw an option:  8. f4.  if he goes for the kill with his bishop (like a lot of players i've played seem to do), then i saw this line:  8. ... bxc3  9. bxc3 dxe4  10. qxd8+ kxd8  11. o-o-o+  he'd get the center, but at least i'd have a developed rook, a protected king and tempo! maybe he saw this, or instinctively saw little gain from taking the knight because of my bishop? taking advantage of his retreat, i aim to keep tempo and the center.  i kinda expected bh4+. oh dear...  this is where things went horribly wrong for me.  i blame the stress of finals week.  i remember signing on, seeing i had a day left to make a move and very rashly making the next move. that pawn is defended, i swear! oh, my pawn isn't there to guard from check anymore... i think i'll have to move my king now. that pawn is still guarded, right?  oh no... #profanities "see you later, honey." i watched thee when the foe was at our side, ready to strike at him—or thee and me, were safety hopeless—rather than divide aught with one loved save love and liberty.  i watched thee on the breakers, when the rock, received our prow, and all was storm and fear, and bade thee cling to me through every shock; this arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier.  i watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes, yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground when overworn with watching, ne’er to rise from thence if thou an early grave hadst found.  the earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall, and men and nature reeled as if with wine. whom did i seek around the tottering hall? for thee. whose safety first provide for? thine.  and when convulsive throes denied my breath the faintest utterance to my fading thought, to thee—to thee—e’en in the gasp of death my spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought.  thus much and more; and yet thou lov’st me not, and never wilt! love dwells not in our will. nor can i blame thee, though it be my lot to strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still.  ~lord byron (1958) desperately trying to get some piece value.  i was in a bind.  i could have also taken black's bishop with the rook, but that would have made it harder to quickly get my king to a safe spot.  plus, it seemed fifty-fifty whether black chose to move his queen to the open file on the left, or sweep down on the right. not only had i lost my queen, but my king was wide open for harassment and an easy checkmate, so i decided to manually make a castle for myself. break the dam! goblins at the gate! some breathing room. so, black's play looked like a double up with the rook and queen- likely with queen at the front.  that would take two turns to do.  plus my other rook at h1 could be threatened by his queen after it moved to b7 followed with d4. the analysis computer doesn't even offer any input at this point.  it's already thrown in the towel for me; probably rightly so.  the idea with this knight move (ne3), was to harass the bishop to gain tempo, which would then lead into a free pawn and more tempo at g7.  the line i foresaw was: 16. ... qb7  17. nf5 b??  18. nxg7+. yep. yep. a retreat!  perhaps to threaten b2, but i didn't think he'd go for it. another reason i decided to place my knight here was that i hoped black would attempt to threaten knight capture with kf8 because this would give me an excuse to develop my rook, trap his king some, and make developing his knight and rook just a little harder to do. now his king is trapped a bit. a developed rook! sweating bullets... pawning up with b3 or b4 didn't yield favorable outcomes.  rab1 gave me just one more move on him to prevent him from doing what he wanted. so, he did go for the bishop move, threatening b2.  bxa3 was out of the question since it was a one move checkmate, but from what i could see, if he did bxb2, then his bishop would have been pinned to his queen.  i saw three decent moves for myself: b3, b4 and bh3 (to connect my rooks and develop my bishop more towards his king). i liked b4 because it provided the possibility to trap his bishop.  from here, things looked ok for me, if black decided to go for trades.  i say "ok," but of course, if black took even trades, he would eventually win the game. it seemed harmless.  why not just go for a5? this was an enormously risky move on my part.  the idea was to get more power pieces centralized around his king because i hoped to get his king into a sticky situation; by so doing, i could conceivably force black to trade down pieces or get a stalemate.  however, if black realized that less pressure was on his pawns at c4 and d5, then he might have been able to pull of a checkmate rather rapidly. ironically, if i had taken with bxc5, his queen would have been forced to run temporarily.  but from there, it would have been likely 23. bxc5 qc7  24. rxb8 qxb8, and now i still have checkmate threatening me.  plus, getting his queen to move, i feared would dispel the hard work i had done thus far.  i also didn't want to lose my b1 rook as it was part of my plan around the e5 pawn. initiation of a plan. he doesn't take. he could have taken with queen, king or knight; or, even, he could have moved his king up, which i wouldn't have recommended. he takes with the queen! at this point, i didn't yet see a clear path to victory.  it seemed too dependent on what my opponent would do. the only logical choice.  as was correctly pointed out to me by damalfi before i messed with my annotations, rg17 is actually a very good move.  in the middle of the game, i failed to see what to do if black moved qd6 in an attempt to save the queen, but this actually paves the way for checkmate.  next move, bxc5, once more threatening the queen.  if black is aggressive with his queen at this point, he loses it.  alternatively, if he is passive and moves qc6 in response, then rxb8+ leads to victory for white. i didn't see that and instead went for another "free" pawn.  if his queen stuck around for one more turn, i'd have it pinned to his king. i thanked my lucky stars.  with this queen placement, a future fork was soon to be available. check.  his likely moves were either to block with queen or knight, or move the king.  at this point, any movement with the king would have given me his queen. a logical choice. now his knight is pinned two ways.  that is not a situation i'd want to be in myself.  my next move was bd7+, which would have forced white to trade down and one permutation would yield a win for me, if he went for it. this didn't do anything to stop my plan. yep.  either black took with the queen, which would have made us even, or he moved kd8, which would have made us even, or he moved kf8, which gave me a win. well then. a very, very lucky win for me. 
-------------------------------------
instead of d6 or d5, or b6... now he has to defend b2. crazy move, without a real purpose.  i thought on quick central exchanges, for a quiet game, looking for drawn, mostly.  now, 9.b4 seems strong.  exchanging his strong b.  well, for a n is better than for my dsb! now i'll have a weak kingside, but i am aware of it.  i can't keep my b pair. true is that defending the d pawn with ne7 was probably better, since my n is doing nothing on c6. i bet you won't be able to mate me. let's see. i should have played e4 now, and accept the exchange: bxe4, and if dxb, qxbd6.  i swore he'd gone for nxbe6. well, i'll force a sacrifice, and let's see how it comes! i think this is the only move which prevents mate and all danger... bringing pieces to my kside. ng6 will cause problems to his q.  now the threat is q or n f6. moreover, the h6 pawn is "hanging". ...et voilá! ...sure... but i think that qd4 was the only sensible move.  i love to trap queens... the truth is that i can play someting like qxr, and his q is still trapped, but... ...but this is neat! now, he has ng5, but all that comes from this move are more minor pieces exchanges, and i also have the threat on rd8, and moreover: nxe3, with incursions from my q... ... but this one was too nice not to play it. white has ne4, but after qxb2... so this is all... thanks for reading!

king's pawn opening. i reply, mirroring my opponent. threatens my pawn with his knight. i protect with my knight. threatens my knight that is protecting my pawn. i protect with the bishop. now, i would protect with the pawn. pushes up his pawn. i threaten the bishop with my pawn. retreats. i open up my other knight, i am now in a castling position. threatens my other knight! i castle, ignoring the threat. gets out the other knight. i threaten with my bishop, pinning the knight to the king. castles. i take the knight. and my opponent takes back. i threaten the bishop. takes my pawn?? i take back. doesn't really do anything. this might be good in the toward the end. i copy, because i don't see anything i can do. i'm waiting for an opportunity. looking to threaten my pawn after nf5. this doesn't do anything. exactly what i was thinking. i protect the pawn with my queen. uh-oh, double threat against my one protecter. i move out of the way. checks me with the knight. i threaten the knight. takes the pawn. not a good move. very risky. i threaten the bishop with my rook. forced to retreat or die, but i still get the bishop. i get the bishop. checks me, not doing anything, though. i retreat. a bit weird, opens up the king to a diagonal. i open up the line for my bishop. pushes up a pawn. this doesn't do anything. i see bh3. the king moves out of the way, smart. the knight is trapped. i will still receive a pawn. i take the knight with my bishop, obviously. takes back. i take with the queen. not a good move. ng5, threatens the rook and mate after nxf3. ng5. my plan begins. retreats. now, for the bait… at a glance one would think. 'huh? sacrifice a knight for a pawn. maybe they didn't see the pawn on g3'. but if one looked closer… takes the bait. now mate in 3. check. forced to move their unless mate in 1 is wanted. i check with the rook, and my opponent is forced to block with the queen, with would result in checkmate. my opponent resigns. this team match is still going. i won both my games. wish my fellow teammate anacronish luck. please comment. thank you.

hello everybody...this is a game that i played with a mate from australia!!! this was our third game and i won the previous two... well his rating is around 950 and mine is around 1420...but a huge mistake of mine showed that he's gonna win... well i started with e4. he played e5.. opening my knight. well he played b6 which was quite worthless i think. so i took his e5 pawn. f6 was not the greatest defence.. so i put it  back. he opened his knight in a awkard square instead of doing something different to develop his pieces in better squares. i played typical with my bishop.. c6 he played. i think bc5 would be better... so i tried to take the space in the centre.. he wanted to exchange our bishops... so i took it... and he took mine..still he's quite back in development. i opened the other knight as well. f5 is quite risky i think.  but i replied with e5 instead of taking the pawn. now he's pushing my knight. and i pushing his queen.. protection.. i was opening my queen for some more pressure. now i wonder if 0-0 would be better.. he took the knight.. i prefer to take it with my pawn instead of taking it with my queen in order to take his knight somehow..haha b5 stopped me doing it. i challenged his pawn. and he played his knight nicely.. now i've made a really bad bad movement...i didn't think so much so i was completely trapped!!! qa3?? so bad for me...i still wonder how i managed to do that! nxc2+!!.. great, so good! i felt so desperate and loser! nothing to do!!! i just played with king though everything seemed tragic! well done mate!!! the only thing that i had in mind was attacking somehow!!! i had to play aggresive though i knew i was lost! so i had a plan or somekind of plan to attack to his king! but he could easily defend i suppose! now he's checking! i simlpy defended! and he took the pawn in order to push me more later! i played e6! he pushed his pawn further! i think 0-0 would be better for him! check..he can't roocke now. he took the pawn! now i wanted checked him continiously in order to win something! again check. i wanted the second roock out as well! he replied badly for me! better would be kc8 i think. the second rook is coming out! logical! nothing more to do. nice movement that he didn't actually take advantage of. now my plan was starting to become reality though i still had a lot to do! so check! nowhere else to go! again check. nice movement i think! he just replied.. now i somehow had the chance to equalize...still he could win the game easily and i could lost 19.5 points!!!! oh god!! haha somehow my plan became truth! but the game was at his hands! i think with that movement lost the game!!! i mean rb1 would be a thousand times better!!! and also i still don't why he hasn't protected his knight!!! until that moment he had the control of this game but now i won't let him win! of course i take advantage of his previous mistake! and still he should have replied better. i mean k b3 would be better. now he killed his game and destroyed everything as his pawn was lost.. took the pawn!! he might try a rook compination. i checked him again...i felt so relieved that i change the game upside down. with some blunders black lost an easy winning game and 19.5 points. i was trying to checkmated him though it would take sometime! he patheticly replied..  i approached his rook! a5 for protection! now i need the compination of all my pieces in order to win! c6 pawn was a target. he's protecting it! i played the knight as a wanted my bishop in the f3 square. he played his knight too. i put it here in order to protect the rook after d5. actually that move never happened. he played his knight and made me change me plans. i checked! i don't know if he played it good. i think it's a bad movement. another check! he played kb7. now i h he was forced away of his rook.so he lost it!! he's lost i suppose...nothing great to do! i check once more! he defended with the rook! another check with the knight!! he played his king!  smart check!!! now he checked me!!! i took the pawn and checked again! he took my useful bishop. bye bye rook! nothing more to do! check... nowhere to go! and fortunately chechmate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ι discomfitted his plans!!!! i'm happy and excited!!!!! wait for your comments and ratings!!!! i hope you liked it and enjoyed it as well!!!! bye bye from me!!!! 
-------------------------------------
3. bb5 - this is the start of the ruy lopez (known as the spanish torture).  this move puts pressure on black's e5, although after the bishop captures the knight and black recaptures with the d pawn, the e pawn cannot be taken immediately because of a queen fork on d4. 3....... a6 - this is the standard defence to this called the morphy defence, puts the question to the lsb. 4. .......... dxc6 - the ruy lopez exchange variation.  now here's a lesson for you, just don't do what i do later on, exchange down to a king and pawn ending with the pawn structure as it is now.  as you will see, you will lose!  you will lose!  i got suckered into playing into the k & p ending because i have never been in a k & p ending with an expert, 500 points north of my rating with material even before and i though i would be ok because my king was more centralised than my opponent's.  my opponent quashed this illusion and gave me a thorough lesson in how to exploit this type of k & p ending! 5. ....... f6 - the gligoric variation - this is considered the most solid response to 5. 0-0.  a more aggressive choice in the db is bg5, but f6 is more my style - f6 backs up the e pawn.  my knight will go to e7 on move 12 after castling queenside. 7. nxd4 - one pair of pawns has been exchanged and relieves pressure on e5.  i now advance my pawn to c5 to drive back the knight. 9. ........ be6 - the queens have been exchanged and i now start to move wood off my back rank beginning with be6. 10. ........... bd6 - develops another piece, maintains protection of the frontal c pawn and screens off the d file to allow queenside castling. 11. bf4 - doubly attacks dsb so i castle queenside, getting my queen rook into play, protecting dsb and challenging the d file. 12. ........ ne7 - white is preparing to double rooks on the d file so i now develop my queen knight and connect my rooks. 13. .......... bxf4.  i decide to deviate from the game: ½-½, invincible1 (1890) vs. gnezz (2144).  gnezz played be5.  i rejected this move because i did not want an isolani as well as my doubleton on the c file.  i admit to following the database but i did assess each move very carefully before making the decision to play it and i chose the line which i felt best suited my style which i mentioned in an earlier note.  in hindsight though, would be5 have been a better move than the one i chose? 14. ............ bf7 - after white recaptured on f4 i backed my bishop off to f7, moving it out of range of the knight on f5 and contesting control of the d5 square. 19. ............... kxd8.  after i moved my bishop off to f7, white replied with 15. nfd5.  this triggered off a plethora of exchanges ending in the position i have now.  the king and pawn ending that i mentioned in an earlier note.  my position is about to go way down south!  i am just wondering whether, instead of contesting the d file with my rook i would have been better served by playing b6 to back up my frontal c pawn and then playing my rook to e8 putting pressure on e5.  you the jury decide! 20.  c4 - stopping my king from advancing too far up the board to counter-attack. 21. ............ kf7 - letting my opponent come to me - but i wonder if there was anything better. 24. .......... c6 - in hindsight i am wondering whether it would have been better to have left the pawn where it was, on c7 it was stopping a wk incursion on d6. 25. ......... kg7?  - would h4  have been a better plan here? 26. h4 - not expecting this.  i was expecting 26. fxg6 kxg6, 27. kf5 b6 28. e5 - then after the exchange of pawns the white king cannot be prevented from gobbling up my queenside pawns! 27. .......... hxg5 - getting rid of the side pawns. 28. kh5 - strong move, planning to get at the f pawn via g6.  i try to prevent this with kh7. 29. ............. kg7 - maintaining the guard on f6 and h6. 30. .......... fxe5 - was kf7 any better? 35. kh4 - here i was expecting f6 - wk could catch up with the e pawn and snaffle it.  although the f and g (the g pawn could be used to decoy the black king onto the g file) pawns may fall the wk could get to the queenside before the bk and gobble up all my queenside pawns. 37. ..... kf6 - stopping the f pawn's advance and guarding the e5 pawn, but for how long? 38. ke4 - here i resigned due to impending ruinous loss of material.  i am now in zugzwang - any move i make now will result in the e pawn dropping off.  if i play kg5 i will be able to take paolo's g pawn in exchange but he will then crown his f pawn.  so there ends the lesson.

this isn't a line played that often, but still somewhat decent for black, called the möller variation. more common are 5...be7, 5...nxe4(my current interest of investigation) and 5...b5 6.bb3 bc5/bb7. but here is where i feel things started to go wrong for black. 9...exd4 or 9...d6 are the most solid choices. as you'll see neglecting the centre may be somewhat disastrous. the only game i could find that featured 9...b5 continued with 12...nxe5 13.nxe5 qxf6 14.ng4 and white won in 62 moves. the text seems to be the most critical test, but allows a quite nice forced combination. 13.qd2 is the same, intending qxh6-g7#. as tempting as it may be, it seems there's no win in sight after 14.ng5+?! kg6! this is the whole point of this line, opening the h-file for my queen to come with check, which will force black to give up his queen to avoid mate. believe it or not, engines have difficulty spotting this idea at first, and suggest taking the draw by repetition with 15.qc1 kh7 16.qc2+ etc. not 18.qxg5+?? ng6 which throws away the win after 19.qh6 qxf6 when there's no 20.qxf6 back. now we reach an interesting middlegame where i have a queen vs 2 minor pieces, but it doesn't look that easy to covert the full point yet. in fact i wasn't sure if i could break through a possible fortress. i decide to give up the b-pawn in order to develop my queenside pieces as soon as possible. going back with 21.qd2/qc1 to simply defend b2 would be a loss of time imo. also my knight would be better placed on c3 than on d2. i felt no hurry to take on a4, as it wasn't going anywhere anyway. first i restrict his dsb, as his infuence on the a7-g1 diagonal alongside his rook on the 7th rank annoys me a bit. exchanging my passive rook for his active one. at this point, i decide it's time to start going after his queenside pawns. my queen did her job on the kingside, now it's time to shift for the other wing. before taking on a3, i provoke him into misplaying his knight into a more passive role, so i win a tempo in comparison to directly taking it. on 31...bc8 then 32.nxa6! bxa6 33.rxc7+ rf7 34.rxf7 kxf7 35.qxa3 bxf2+ 36.kxf2 should be easily winning, as he must give up a piece to stop my a-pawn. a small finesse by my opponent. the immediate 33...re8 is met by 34.nxc7 winning a piece. intending mate, so i must be a bit careful here. if 36.rxa7? re1#, and 36.qc1?! threatening qh6+ seems tempting, but then 36...nf4! is a bit tricky(37.rxa7 ne2+; 37.qxf4? re1#). so by elimination, i opted for the text. the most forcing, as i give up the exchange for a pawn to render his pieces immobile for the rest of the game. once again, 39.nxc7? bd3+ 40.kg1 re1# is a big no, so we must never get careless. no need to trade as my knight is far superior to his remaining bishop now. and that alongside the pin on his knight is decisive. prevents nf8+ and nxg6, but all it's according to my original idea. and here my opponent resigned, as there isn't much to be done anymore. once i get my pawn to a6(which he won't be able to take due to qf7+ and qxg6), i'll just advance my kingside ones to finally break through. this was quite a nice example, and thanks to redenaar for this great game! 
-------------------------------------
white opens with the english and black plays a slow response. seeing it as an opportunity white charges out of the opening book and into the center.    already both players begin to slip. white really should keep f3 open for the knight. having both knight and bishop aimed at f2 is a bit cramped; of course 5. bf3 leaves the d-pawn undefended. on the other hand, black would be better attacking with e5 supported by his bishop. here white can capture because 5. dxc5 bxb2 6. bxb2 gains the long diagonal and 5. dxc5 dxc5 6. qxd8+ dislocates black's king.    a questionable move. if 5....cxd4, then white should have a fair game; but by abandoning the b-pawn, white invites 5....nc6! black gets a leg up in the struggle for central control, and white cannot kick the knight away because 6. d5 bxb2 now wins the rook.   black eyes the b-pawn, but comes at it directly rather than exploiting it. white tries to defend the center, but black can still take control of d4 with nc6. white quickly runs out of defenders.   7. nbc3 might be slightly better for white, but also makes the knights a bit redundant. 7. nd2 aims at keeping the knight's more efficient with the hope of trapping or kicking black's queen later, and of course defending white's rook for the moment. it also prepares nb3, defending d4 if needed.     a small zwischenzug removes one defender of d4. the material lost seems to be worth the defense of the center; but the game is still a bit favorable for black.    9. bxd4 might be better here, attempting a more permanent end to the bishop perched on g7: either an exchange or 9. bxd4 e4 10. bc3? leaving the black bishop cut off. however, two pawns down, white is not looking to trade material and the knight is a less favorable exchange for black's bishop.   white's unusual defense continues, adding two defenders to d4. 10. nxc6 may have been slightly better, reliving the tension at d4 and giving white time to castle.   this is a serious blunder for black! and at last white has a chance to get back some lost material, though the combination is somewhat elusive. 11. ra1! qb2 12. nxc6 and black cannot retake the knight because 12....bxc6 13. bd4 will win black's queen. since white's been looking to trap the queen he should have caught this opportunity to exploit it…   ...but alas, one serious blunder deserves another.     white's king catches a breeze as the black queen goes by. pale in the face he pulls his rook to safety, which renders castling impossible. black should have an easy game now.   four pawns down white tries for a counter attack. of course, black has a few ways to stop the fork, and white may have done better to play nxc6, aiming to relieve some pressure. of course the fork is hardly the plan, and white is looking for lines like 13.... rb8 14. nxa7 nxa7 15. bxa7 ra8 16. ra1; peeling off the a-pawn which could become a dangerous passer. but truth be told, black is perfectly safe after castling.   yet in the fury the blitz, black doesn't defend against the fork at all, and white jumps at the opportunity to gain some lost material. the game is essentially even.   now black gets to try an attack of his own. white can save his rook with rf2 or rg1; but after 16. rg1 kd7 black will win the knight outright. instead white goes for rf2, hoping for the pin 16. rf2 qg3 17. nb6 axb6 18. bxb6+ kd7 19. ra1; which removes the passed a-pawn and controls the empty file.   black doesn't go for it, and instead skewers white's queen. 17. bf1 bxf1 18.kd2 may be tempting initially, but after 18.... bh6! 19.qxf1 bxe3+ 20.kxe3 qg5+ white finds he can no longer gain the a-pawn for his cornered knight.   after trading queen's, black takes a shot at his hostage. white's former plan, 19. nb6 axb6 20. bxb6 ra8 now gives black control of the a-file, so white's attention turns to the roaming bishop. here white had a position and failed to capitalize on it. 19. rh2 is much better with lines like 19. rh2 be6 20. nd4 rxe8 21. nxe6. black cannot afford to play 20....nxd4  because 21. rxb7+ kc8 (kc6 is mate) 22. rc7+ kd8 23.bxd4 wins black's knight while saving white's own.    white misses a minor zwischenzug, 20. nb6+ axb6 21. rxf1. if black responses with kc7 white will at least have time to claim the a-file; if ra8 then white will at least win an extra pawn. instead, the game slowly dwindles back into black's control.     black now pushing the a-pawn as expected, but 21....d5 22. exd5 nxd5 might have been a bit better, isolating white's f-pawn and attacking the bishop.   a first step to breaking away black's king-side pawn majority. the a-pawn is not a terrible threat at the moment; white will be able to defend at the last moment, but will require committing a piece. best to try and make something happen while the pieces are free.     white connects his rooks, allowing the possibly of capturing the a-pawn after promotion (when black hits a2 white will play rc1 or rd1 to enable this), and thus avoiding a lengthy commitment. meanwhile, king knight and bishop will fight for center, though a bit overwhelmed. however, black cannot defend the b-pawn with his king because 24.... kc7 25. nb5+ kd7 26. nd4 repeats the position in order to avoid sacrificing the d-pawn. hence 24.... nd8 seems necessary and the central fight becomes a balanced match.    but, when black hangs the b-pawn the plan changes. white's b-rook will go on the attack and (hopefully after nxd4+ bxd4) white's bishop and f-rook will defend a1. getting his bishop on the long the diagonal will be critical for white's success.   indirectly defends the knight on c6, but black takes another hit to his king-side. here 25....ke8 26. nxc6 nd7? gives up some material but controls the long-diagonal and through it a1. ultimately white would have given up a rook for bishop in order to stop the promotion.   at this point time pressure has really sunk in. black makes an aggressive check, but surrenders the coveted long-diagonal. 26....ra7 27. rxa7 nxa7 is recommended but not much better. either way the promotion is becoming less feasible.   black aims to reclaim the diagonal with a sacrifice, but fails to assess the position of white's rooks; or perhaps he was expecting 28. bxg6 ng3+, trying to destroy the spare rook. in any case, white caught the combination here.   abandoning the defense of f8 and enabling white's rooks to take complete control of the board. it begins with the skewering of black's rook.    pushing black's king away white will win the rook and stop the a-pawn. black may defend it, but it could never move to a2.   black has lost, but could have held on a little longer with bb2 or bc5. of course, unable to defend a2 the a-pawn would never advance anyway, so at this point it isn't going to matter much.   moving one's last piece into a pin seems hardly advisable. white could have followed with 35. rh7; it is i think a little quicker, but low on time white plays simple.  white pins the d-pawn, crippling the bishop's defender. if black does not move his king 35. rxc5+ kxc5 36. ke3 g5 37. rh6 h4 38. rh5 g4 39. rxh4 g3 39. rg4 leads to a routine kr&k endgame. it is perhaps not the quickest, but white will waste no time calculating. if black moves the king 35. rxg7 isolates the h-pawn and 36.kf3 defends the e-pawn blocking d5. white should win easily from the light squares. black resigns.  
-------------------------------------
this was a non rated, sicilian defense game for tutoring purposes, between my friend ajay (grey_sparrow) and myself, scott miller (faithfulltrav). so 1. e4 c5 marks the sicilian defense, a very tactical defense filled with potential for both sides. so ajay, as you mentioned in one of your comments (now deleted due to comments posted afterward), you noticed on the openings website i sent you to, that the bishop is seldom brought out early in the sicilian, and when it is, the results are not good for white. here's why: in this early stage in the opening, you don't know what squares will be best for the bishops, and you know the knights are best on c3 & f3. the best squares for the bishops is determined by the pawn structure and the other pieces (especially pawns). so it is best to move the knights out, and see what develops in the pawns and pieces before moving the bishops. it turns out this was not the best square for the bishop. the consequences are evidenced in 2 ways: 1. i forced you to move the bishop a 2nd time, gaining development for me and losing it for you. 2. more important, after your later qe2, the bishop had very little space to move to, so i cornered and slayed him (poor guy). this is the sicilian, anderssen variation. after my knight move here, white has 4. e5, which appears at a glance to be strong, but then 4. ...d5! 5. bb5+ nd7 later followed by ...a6 and possibly ...b5. (?) this is the move that blocked off your bishop, inviting an odd but strong 7th move on my part. he (the bishop) needed access to the a6-f1 diagonal. i demonstrated that the b3 and a4 squares were unsafe. (?) although this move looks perfectly natural, i consider it to be a question mark move, due to the reasons stated in my next move.  the note above was previously input, but on reviewing again, i see you had no better choice here, since 7. bb3 c4 8. ba4+ kf8 leads to the same line we played. (!?) so conventional chess theory would say, "block the check with the bishop or knight. don't relinquish the right and privilege of being able to castle." i've never been one to hold to conventional theory. i am an innovator, always seeking out new ideas. in our previous game*, i stated "every principle has some exceptions". i gave the example of a natural, man made law - to stop at a red light - which most people would violate if given the right circumstance. i made an imaginary scenario of you having an injured loved one in critical condition. there is no ambulance in your town, so you have to drive half an hour to the hospital. you may go through a red light or two. similarly, chess principles are guidelines only - they should not be adhered to dogmatically.   ajay, you may remember, i took several days to make this move, as i suggested to you at the beginning, "analyze, analyze, analyze!". so here are my thoughts that brought about this strange move:   i. the bishop on b5 is restricted. the only square he can go to which "seems" safe is a4. i say seems because as we see, it is really deadly for the bishop. moving to d3 is not safe as 8. ... c4 traps the bishop.   ii. if i block the check with a knight or bishop, then when i harass the bishop you can get him out of trouble by trading.  iii. i can trap the bishop via:  a. 8. ... a6 followed by 9. ... b5 and 10. c4. b. if 8. a3 a6 9. ba4 c4 still traps him. this is the line that was played.  iv. although white gets the 1st move, in this position, he only has 4 development moves, while black has 5 development moves. so ajay, do you know how to count development moves? if not, send me a note to say you need more info and i will explain. until then, suffice to say that black is ahead in development, while white has some compensation due to the black king's position. i was planning on manually castling via g6, ... kg7, ... re8. on one hand. manually castling loses development because instead of 1 move to castle, it takes 4 moves on king-side castling (2 moves for the king, 1 pawn push and the rook move). on the other hand, i was already ahead in development and i was planning on forcing you to lose more development. (see point iv below.) so i felt manually castling was justified. i also had the prospect of winning your bishop (not yet forced). as it turned out i never did manually castle. i always saw a stronger move.  v. white can move his queen to make space for the bishop. then if 8. ... a6, 9. be2 (9. bf1? would further impede his development). if he moves his queen, the queen only has 3 safe squares to go to: d1, f1 & e5 (8. qe3? d4 forking the queen and knight).  a. if 8. qd1 a6 9. be2, you would be even further behind in development. you would only have 3 development moves, while black has 5, plus it's black's move, making it 6.   b. if 8. qf1 a6 9. be2, you are even further behind than example a, since your queen blocks you from kingside castling.  c. if 8. qe5, (see comment below) (?) you might have expected 8. ... a6 9. ba4 b5 10. bb3 c4 11. ba2. while not winning the bishop, this would have seriously impeded your lsb. yet the line i played was stronger: 8. a6 9. ba4 c4, the move you stated was a surprise! it's important in chess to look at what i call "crazy moves". it's the moves that are ridiculously outlandish, that are frequently the best! for example, in this game: 7. ...kf8! & 9. ... c4! (especially kf8).  for more on "crazy moves" study the games of masters such as bobby fischer and josé raúl capablanca. to make some of the moves they made, they definitely would have seemed insane. but the analysis that followed proved they were solid moves. there is the move! your bishop is trapped (though not yet attacked, you know it's coming and he has no escape)! this move somewhat opens the line up to your king so that if you choose to give up the knight instead of the bishop, i can play qa5+, winning both pieces, (actually what happened)! you will lose the bishop regardless, so you'd be better off castling. i would not necessarily put a question mark by 10. d3, since capturing with the knight is what really opened you up, (since i can't check you with the knight there).  (???) now the question mark. on every move, think, "can he attack me in any way? can he check me?" you may have thought that on your last move, i don't know. but scenarios change every move you make. remember, as opposed to otb chess, you have days (or in the case of this game, 2 weeks!) to make each move. that's a lot of time, so take the time to think it through! so now i have 2 minor pieces in exchange for 2 pawns! definitely a won game for black. my goal now is to gain development as quickly as possible, instead of getting greedy with 14. ...qxb2 15. rfb1 qxc2 16 ne1 qa4. removing your knight on f3 enables my knight to go to d4, forking the queen on f3 and the pawn on c2. you can't afford to sacrifice the c2 pawn because the knight would be forking your rooks. thus your queen has to retreat to the passive d1, leaving the d3 pawn undefended. i could have taken the d-pawn here but i felt the knight move was stronger. it attacks the rook and, more importantly, prevents the rook from moving to the opened c file. it is only to my advantage to trade, as once everything is traded off, then i bring my king and latent h8 rook into the game. again, with this move, i'm trying to trade stuff off, but you resigned. ajay, once again, it's been my pleasure. 
-------------------------------------
magnus carlsen has described this game as "a game for the ages". watch the world champion sacrifice a rook and demolish world number 2 levon aronian in just 23 moves.  my annotations begin where the action begins i.e. on move 11.   capturing the white pawn before the white bishop has been moved to d3 results in a loss of tempi for black. now aronian has to capture on c4 with his bishop. and anand will, in his next move, promptly drive it back to d3 again thereby gaining a tempo. ok folks! this is where the action begins.  you see, while anand’s rook move is not new in this position, it is less common than the move 10. … a6. this move is very natural. black’s main goal in these sorts of double queen pawn openings is to play his pawn to c5 under favorable circumstances. this move frees his position and gets rid of a weak, backward pawn. the problem with playing the pawn to c5 directly is that the pawn on b5 is then left without protection. so moving the pawn to a6 first, to protect the pawn on b5, makes a lot of sense.   this is where anand's home preparation lasted till. from his home preparation he knew the fundamental idea that 12. ng5 is unsound for white when black has played 11.... rc8 instead of playing  11.... a6 first. however, anand still had to see the game till the very end from here. he thought for a full one and a half hours before he made his next move.  usually in this situation, after black's usual move of 11. ... a3, white’s knight move makes a lot of sense. of course, black can play the tactical shot 11. … bxh2+ 12. kxh2 ng4+, and after white gets out of check black will win back the piece with 13. … qxg5. the general feeling, though, is that white’s two bishops and better coordination give him a strong position.  the significance of this game is that anand showed why white’s ng5 idea is a bit dubious after rc8. black did not go for the tactical shot, nor did he worry about the weak h-pawn, nor did he worry about a weakness on b5. he simply played 12. … c5 right away. the line-up of the black rook on c8 with the white queen on c2 gives black a lot of tactical possibilities. white replied with 13. nxh7, grabbing a pawn and threatening the rook on f8. anand then played 13. … ng4, leading to this position:  suddenly black has quite the attack. both of his bishops are pointed ominously at white’s king, and black’s knight on g4 is soon to be joined by the queen arriving on h4. that’s a lot of firepower.     white played 14. f4. this closes the black bishop’s path to h2. sadly, white closes one diagonal only by opening another. anand will later pounced on this new diagonal as you will see.  ok, you're playing black. what move would you play here? !!  it is for this move that the game has been dubbed "anand's immortal" by chess commentators. i wonder how many players, even grandmasters, would have found this move over the board?!  notice how anand's bishop now occupies the same diagonal that aronian had vacated when he had moved 14.f4 a move ago. can’t white just take black’s bishop with his pawn? well, yes. but it won’t go well for him. black will reply with nxc5, and suddenly white has all sorts of problems. black is threatening both to win back the piece by taking the white bishop on d3, and also to play qd4+. taking advantage of the diagonal opened by white when he moved his pawn to f4. the tactics get very messy to calculate, but suffice it to say that black is doing very well indeed.  so white tried 16. be2 here, with the idea of chasing back the black knight on g4. if black were actually forced to retreat now, this would be a good move. sadly for white, anand has another trick up his sleeve.    ok, again, you're playing black. what would be your next move? !! anand played 16. … nde5!! (that’s right! two double exclam moves in a row!!)  let’s take stock. black’s bishop on c5, his knight on e5, and his rook on f8 are all under attack. if the knight on e5 moves, then the knight on g4 will be hanging. but white is the one in big trouble!  calculating all the variations would lengthen this post beyond decency, so let’s just look at how things went. we have reached a critical moment. white is up a full rook, but he is still facing a strong attack. it looks like black could now play the crushing move qh4. he must resist the temptation to do so, however, since white would then get the last laugh by playing qh7+. black would be forced to exchange queens, after which his attack is kaput and white will just be up an exchange.    !! the third double exclam move in the same game ! anand played 19. … f5!!. a quiet move this time. he simply shuts down the diagonal leading from c4 to h7. now he really is threatening to play qh4, after which white will run out of time before finding a reasonable defense.  these quiet moves are always the hardest to find. after the game anand remarked that he felt proud of himself for having found 19. ... f5 over the board.  aronian played his queen to d3 to protect his pawn on h3.  (the g2 pawn is pinned by the black bishop on b7) !!  the fourth double exclam move in the same game. this move cuts off the aronian's queen from defending his pawn on h3. and aronian resigned here.....what a finish by anand !   a masterful game by anand, one of the most underrated world champions ever. actually he is probably among the top 8 chess players of all time. see this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_top_chess_players_throughout_history  thanks for watching the game. i'd appreciate your comments.. 
-------------------------------------
in this game i get a good position, but i let it slide, but i think my opponent played very well - well above his rating! this is a usual reply, preventing e2-e4 and so it this, preparing nb1-c3 he prepares to put his bishop on g7 i prepare e2-e4 he plays the king's indian defence, c7-c5 or d7-d5 are usual here too so i seize the centre.  he prevents e4-e5, although bobby fischer showed that 0-0 was quite playable this is the sämisch variation, it is named after friedrich sämisch, who developed the system in the 1920s. this is usual as is this he develops and so do i this is most common in this position, prehaps preparing b7-b5 should white play 0-0-0 i develop my queen and he further prepares b7-b5. this is the panno variation of the sämisch. black prepares to respond appropriately depending on white's choice of plan. if white plays 0-0-0 and goes for a kingside attack, then 7...a6 prepares ...b7–b5 with a counterattack against white's castled position. if instead white plays more cautiously, then black challenges white's centre with ...e5. so i try an aggressive strike against his king-side. and he strikes back aggressively on the queen-side. we have a very double-edged position. so i take he has to take this way, rxb5 allows nxb5 and i go back to my king-side attack, hoping for, as bobby fischer said, sac, sac, mate. this position was reached in vonthron, horst (2335) vs. heinl, thomas (2250), which white won. black cannot afford to just wait for white's attack to break through. in the above-mentioned game, black tried e7-e5 i am thinking for myself now. exchanging bishops seemed thematic, weakening his king-side. this came as a surprise. can't he see i can hang onto my bishop now? qh6 is the only move not to lose a piece. this is given as a mistake in the post-game computer analysis (pmca), which gives the position as plus 1.4 for white now, compared with level after nc6-b4 i was playing for mate - and i thought i would mate him. although not given as a mistake in the pmca, it gives as the best line for both sides as rxb2 14. bxf8 qxf8 15. qc1 bd7 16. nxc3 qb8 17. d5 nd4 18. rb1 rxb1 19. qxb1 qxb1+ 20. nxb1 c5 21. nc3, so maybe i should have grabbed the exchange this is also given as a mistake, pmca gives nc6-b4 again again, not given as a mistake 15. nf4 nb4 16. nxh5 f5 17. nf6+ kf7 18. bc4+ e6 19. nxh7 nc2+ 20. kf1 nxa1 21. bxf8 rb1+ 22. kf2 rxh1 23. qxh1 is given as best for both sides, with plus 3.92 for white, as opposed to plus 2.53 after g4, so maybe g4 is a mistake? what do you think dear reader?
-------------------------------------
la case b4 est faible. les noirs vont l'exploiter. la case b5 est aussi faible pour les noirs.  peut-être plutôt qb3. naturellement. il fallait jouer nxn les noirs se mettent dans une situation où le cavalier va se retrouver cloué. il faut toujours bien calculer les conséquences. ici, la suite démontre que les noirs pouvaient se permettre de jouer ainsi. ta6 était possiblement meilleur ?! aurait du perdre une pièce. il fallait prendre le cavalier avec la dame. les noirs retournent la politesse. cxc échec!!! était le coup. il ne faut jamais manquer un échec dans une combinaison. destination pion faible. les noirs devraient gagner un second pion et l'emporter malgré la chance ratée au 12ème coup. ce n'est pas la bonne façon de gagner le pion (encore la pièce clouée qui joue des tours (sans jeu de mot). prendre avec la tour était préférable, mais le meilleur coup était be7. le pion blanc finira probablement par tomber, mais dans des circonstances plus favorables. le sous-développement des noirs du côté roi peut être trés désagréable si les blancs s'emparent de la colonne a avec une tour, ce qui va arriver si les noirs tentent de prendre le pion a tout de suite. un petit piège se prépare. et les noirs tombent dedans. mais... occasion ratée. nxc5 permet aux blancs de regagner leur pion perdu. ramener le fou en c6 était préférable (toujours pour éviter de donner la colonne a aux blancs). ou fd7 qui empêche nf5, mais ce n"est peut-être pas si dangereux. l'idée est de placer ensuite le fou en c8 (ou b7) pour protéger le pion a6 (après échange des tours), et surtout empêcher l'autre tour blanche de s'emparer de la colonne a. le meilleur coup. mais les blancs s'emparent de la colonne a. encore le meilleur coup dans les circonstances. les noirs gagnent toujours grâce à leur pion supplémentaire passé, mais attention à d6! g6 était absolument nécessaire. autre erreur, celle-ci fatale. bg5 est un moindre mal, mais les blancs prennent de toute façon le contrôle. ici les blancs manquent nxb et le mat qui suit si la tour prend. mais ce coup gagne aussi. le meilleur des coups perdants. les blancs se permettent une fantaisie bien inutile qui va permettre aux noirs de mieux placer leur cavalier et attaquer le pion d3. il fallait essayer fd8. même dans ce cas, il est peu probable que le pion passé en b fasse une grande différence. la tour blanche peut trop facilement le capturer s'il avance. gagne le fou. il me semble que tour prend fou suivi de h4 est plus expéditif, mais il faudrait analyser plus longuement pour le démontrer. ce coup suffit. un réseau de mat se prépare. aussi bien tenter sa chance. le réseau se resserre. il n'y a plus rien à faire. une partie relativement simple, mais où les deux côtés ont manqué de belles chances. le sous-développement des noirs du côté roi a été fatal. morale : attention aux pièces clouées... et ne jamais manquer un échec. stratégiquement parlant, l'erreur de base était de prendre le pion au 14ème coup.

hi everyone!  i am now playing my return match in charles higgie's themed mt against expert thebutz.  this game was started straight after my win against him with the black pieces.  an exchange sac occurs again in this game but who is the giver and who is the receiver of it?  will i make it expert victory no.5?  we shall see.  this themed mt starts with 1. d4. 3. nf3 - transposing this opening into a reti. 5. cxd5 - pawn trade. 6.e4 - it looks as though i am leaving my e4 pawn en prise.  however if black takes it he walks his knight into a pin along the e column. 9. nc3 - a developing move which backs up the e pawn.  this pawn will be vulnerable to attack for the duration of the game but will never be taken. 12. a3 - preventing b4. 13. bf4 - suddenly putting pressure on black's backward qp. 16. ….. kg7 - bishop trade - and now king butz is looking rather exposed! 18. g4 - despite castling on the same side i cannot resist the thought of initiating another mating attack!  this moves stabs at the h5 knight. 19. qf4 - here comes glenda! 20. ne2 - sir lollabout moves towards the kingside to evade pawn menace and to assist in storming the black kingside position. 21. …… rxe5 - knight trade. 22. ….. rae8 - black counter-attacks by putting pressure on my e4 pawn but now i further advance my g pawn.  note if the black knight goes back to h5 it will be immediately traded off. 24. qh4 - further in! 25. qh6+ - glenda being on this square has usually spelt doom and gloom for my opponents.  can she do the biz here?  we shall see. 26. f4 - another pawn push! 28. nf5 - what's this?  a knight sac?  if black accepts then he must be prepared for a nasty check on g1. 29. rg1 - now the g6 pawn is pinned. 29. ….. qc7 - rather passive.  qf2 would have been more of a nuisance. 30. rxg6+ - here comes the exchange sac.  at first it looks like a straightforward rook sacrifice but i firstly pick up two pawns for the rook and the knight will fall two moves later. 32. …… rf8 - trying to chase glenda away but he has reckoned without …….. 33. nh6+!! - this move brings about instant resignation as his f8 rook is doomed for starters.  but that is not all.  ga has flagged up a forced #6 for yours truly.  yup, it is my fifth expert victory and the second time an expert has resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate - you wouldn't believe that a player with a tendency of passivitis would do this to an expert would you - heady, just heady! 
-------------------------------------
hi everyone!  here is another match with mike.  this time i become more active in the middlegame but mike rebuffs my mating attack before it really gets started.  i drop material but does it result in a loss or will it be yet another houdini act from yours truly?  you can either find out from the ga below or you can simply read on. 1. ….. nf6 - mike responds to my reti opening by also bringing out his king knight. 4. nc3 - out comes the other knight.  white's pawn centre looks good but can it be maintained? 5. e4 - and now i add to it. 8. be3 - well, black looks more cramped than white - will i just this once avoid passivitis against mike? 10. cxd5 - pawn trade. 15. …… kxg7 - knight trade. 16. …… gxf5 - another pawn trade. 17. bd1 - king mike is really exposed here, but can i take full advantage of this? 19. qg3? - and according to ga this is where i over-reach myself, it looks as though i have a nasty double check planned but mike foils this with …... 17. ….. rg6! - like this, my knight is now pinned against glenda. 22. …… rxg5 - after a plethora of exchanges including the queens i am now a pawn down.  sigh! 25. …… rag7 - a nasty rook pile on the g column will yield mike a second pawn, double sigh! 27. ……. bg4 - pin and a threat of removal of the guard on the g3 pawn.  i can do zilch about this and if henry moves to g2 then i will be hit with g3+ losing the knight on e2. 28. rd2 - pin breaker but here comes another stinger. 33. kxg2 - after another plethora of exchanges after mike pins my knight to my rook i have a bvn endgame two pawns down.  does henry have a prayer?  well, so long as i keep my mitts off the resign button he does because there may be some divine intervention on the way. 25. axb4 - pawn trade.  i may now have the chance of picking off the isolani on b5 and winning back one of my pawns. 36. kf3 - henry gets to the action as quickly as he can. 39. bxb5 - one pawn regained. 40. bd7 - to cut the h pawn off. 42. b5 - passers must be pushed! 43. kf3 - incredibly it looks as though there is a joblock operating here, on a chessboard with hardly any pieces on it.  it is king mike who is being blocked from helping his pawn through to g8!  fou leblanc and my isolated d5 pawn protect each other. 44. ke4 and draw offer.  on the previous turn mike told me he thought this game was heading for a draw.  mike's knight is tied down to preventing my b pawn from reaching glendadom, fou leblanc cuts off the h pawn and henry still cuts off king mike from assisting it down to h8 so that was why mike and i considered the game drawn at this point.  so, divine intervention from fou leblanc and another operation joblock means that houdini jo escapes again!  more triple wheew!

hi everyone!  it is high time i did an annotation.  haven't done any since my cancer diagnosis (had my 3rd round of chemo today). feeling a bit more up to doing a few more.  this game meanders into the late middlegame with both sides playing solidly.  i try another mating attack but it gets rebuffed.  this game ends with me trying to checkmate him with glenda and my rook but he uses his queen as a get out of jail free card and henry cannot avoid her checks - sssss and double ssss.  well, we will all get to see how this comes about. 1. ……. e5 - each side is willing to play a king pawn ending. 3. ……. bc5 - guicco piano. 6. …… bb6 - fou lenoir is driven back by a pawn stab.  however, he still attacks f2. 8. …… a6 - ensuring that i keep fou lenoir bearing down on f2. 10. …… ng6 - sir lollabout comes over to cover the kingside to defend but to possibly attack the kingside at a later date. 11. …… ba7 - i still want to keep fou lenoir thank you! 14. fxe3 - i end up doubling my opponent's kingside pawns as a result of this exchange. 16. ……. nh7 - sir slugabout moves to a7 because i smell the risk of luca exploiting a possible overload combo on the squares f6 and h6.  it does open the d8-h4 diagonal for glenda as well. 18. ….. nh4 - i had been considering bxh3 - a bishop for pawn sac.  with this knight on h4 this sac could be a bit stronger due to the fact that glenda can hop onto g5 and eye up g2. 21. qxf3 - foiled - but i will not give up! 23. …… rae8 - 'bout time i brought my big guns into action! 26. rxa2 - bishop trade. 27. …… nh5 - threatening a fork on g3. 29...….. qe1 - declines queen trade. 29. …… qd6 - pins knight on b8-h2 diagonal and threatens f6. 32. …… re6 - suddenly the knight on f6 looks to be under pressure. 34. qxg4 - knight trade and f7 is under the hammer.  i bring back my rook to e7 to defend it. 35. ….. qd7 - and glenda yet again earns her sobriquet glenda the defender.  but hopefully not too long! 38. ….. re4 - still attacking though - i just cannot resist it can i? 29. qd3 - ah luca!  now you can do some defending for a change! 41. ….. rxe1+ - rook trade. 44. ….. qg3 - threatening re1+ winning q for r, but now luca gets a get out of jail free card with qc8+ and a draw offer which i accept.  at least this draw gave me another sojourn in the 1900s from 23.11.19-13.1.20!  
-------------------------------------
hi everyone!  this is now my 500th annotation.  i am up against a class a player in my sneaky knights v king of the castle team game.  a fairly close game was played but an exchange down into a pure k&p ending led to one player losing a pawn and that sort of ending usually means only one thing - an eventual zugzwang.  but which player met that fate?  well, you will have to read on. 2. ….. dxc4 - qga accepted. 3. …. nf6 - development. 5. bxc4 - gambit pawn regained. 8. rxd1 - queen trade. 10. ….. 0-0 - even with the queens off the board i still feel it is best to put henry on the kingside, especially with a white rook bearing down on the d column. 13. ….. bxd8 - rook trade.  at least i am well shot of that d1 rook but i must do something about my ecclesiastical twins fou leblanc and fou lenoir on the back row as they are obstructing my remaining rook of getting into the game.  thankfully white still needs to complete his queenside development so i do have a little time to resolve this issue. 15. ….. bb7 - first part of mission accomplished.  16. …. be7 - part 2 accomplished - at least my rook has a clear line on the back row. 17. ….. rc8 - this move triggers off a plethora of exchanges. 20. …… bb7 - dodge attack and then think about what to do next. 23. bg4 - putting pressure on e6 but henry now goes to its aid. 24. nc5 - i anticipated this move but i am not afraid because it can now be traded off. 25. …… f5 - preparing an exchange of bishops on c5 but i do not want henry tied down to e6.  white should have played bxe7 and after kxe7 retreated his bishop, this would have led to a draw methinks but now white retreats his attacked bishop first (be2?) and now i can initiate a bishop trade and white's passed c pawn is now a target for henry to zero in on. 27. ……. bd5 - allowing henry plenty of room to attack the c pawn from the front. 29. …… kd7 - closer and closer! 32. …… bxc4 - bishop trade.  this messes up my queenside pawns but white's are also very pickable.  big breakfast for henry! 34. ….. kxc5 - yum!  that c pawn has now fallen and i now need to get white into a zugzwang in order to move in for the kill. 35. ….. e5 - blocking off king bondi from f4. 38. h3 - white will soon run out of safe moves! 38. ….. a5 - after this move my opponent said the word "zug" in the chat.  i wrote back 'fraid so! he then waved the white flag.  9.2 rating points in the bag - a big step towards 1850 - nice!

la jugada recomendada aquí generalmente, es cxb5, siguiéndose una sucesión como la que se muestra en la primera variacion.     también se puede jugar según la segunda variación precedente, con lo que se llega a una estructura de peones que cierra el flanco de dama -el plan del negro en el gambito volga es atacar desde ahí - que obtiene una puntuación positiva y apenas inferior que cxb5, según la segunda variación que se muestra.     pero jugar ahora b3 no produce los mismos efectos, cómo se verá a continuación. alternative variation: [ 22:+0.24] 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 e6 6.nc3 exd5 7.nxd5 bxa6

negras prefiere ag7.  las negras están algo mejor.     jugué así pensando en luego jugar e4 y ad3 para conformar un buen centro. sin embargo el motor de cálculo la halla bastante dudosa y propone e3 y las siguientes jugadas que se vieron en la precedente variación.     nótese además que acumulando jugadas menos que óptimas, he ido acumulando una pérdida en mi posicion que hace que ahora el negro tenga una ligera ventaja alternative variation: [ 19:-0.22] 8.e3 o-o 9.be2 nbd7 10.nbd2 rb8 11.bc3 nb6 12.o-o qe8 13.rc1 bd7 14.ba1 bf5 15.nh4 bc8 16.qc2 e6 17.dxe6 bxe6 18.ne4 qe7   jugué la torre allí para proteger mi alfil en caso de cambio con el alfil negro de introini. el motor de cálculo recomienda en su lugar ir con e3, según se ve en la precedente variación.          también incluyo la variación que en el análisis post mortem hicimos con introini y con juan babío, que estaba presente. junto supusimos que e4 ahora hubiese evitado la entrada del alfil y los sucesos posteriores. sin embargo, e4 es claramente inferior, ya que pierdo un peón y también quedo sin pareja de alfiles. alternative variation: [ 20:-0.58] 9.nd2 na6 10.rb1 rb8 11.e4 qa5 12.qc1 bd7 13.f3 bh6 14.a3 nc7 15.qc2

que hice aquí, ya que creía inevitable quedar con una pieza de menos,... y frente a un rival tan poderoso, me desmoralicé. intenté "aguantar" un poco más, pero en realidad ya daba todo por perdido.           y si bien estaba inferior, aun no estaba todo liquidado.  se debió haber jugado según antes se comentó. ahora la ventaja de mi rival comienza a ser cada vez más fuerte. alternative variation: [

estaba de que luego seguía axf3 y yo quedaba con peones doblados incrementando la ventaja de introini.          así que lo hice aun peor.          en realidad, aquí debí de abandonar, seguí jugando

friedrich saemisch (charlottenburg, 20 settembre 1896 – berlino, 16 agosto 1975), è stato uno scacchista tedesco.  pur essendo stato un forte giocatore, vincitore di numerosi tornei, friedrich sämisch è noto soprattutto per aver dato il suo nome a due importanti varianti di apertura: alla difesa est indiana: 1. d4 cf6 2. c4 g6 3. cc3 ag7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 alla difesa nimzowitsch: 1. d4 cf6 2. c4 e6 3. cc3 ab4. 4. a3  nel 1950 fu uno dei 27 giocatori che la fide nominò grande maestro quando il titolo venne ufficialmente creato.  nel torneo di carlsbad del 1929 non ottenne una buona classifica, ma vinse il premio di bellezza per la partita contro grünfeld. nello stesso torneo vinse anche con josé raúl capablanca. il grande cubano fece una svista in apertura e perse un pezzo, ma anziché abbandonare, come avviene in questo caso nelle partite di alto livello, tentò di resistere. lo svantaggio si dimostrò troppo grande anche per un giocatore della sua classe. questa sconfitta costò a capablanca il primo posto nel torneo (si classificò pari secondo a mezzo punto da aaron nimzowitsch).  noi in questo forum cercheremo di scrutare più a fondo la variante della difesa est indiana  1. d4 cf6 2. c4 g6 3. cc3 ag7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 (il bianco consolida la struttura dei pedoni centrali, riservandosi di rispondere alla spinta del nero in e5 o c5 con la spinta in d5, assicurandosi una forte catena pedoni sulle case bianche. in questa variante, usualmente, il bianco arrocca lungo; contrariamente al normale sviluppo strategico della partita con arrocchi eterogenei e centro bloccato, qui il bianco e il nero possono condure l’attacco e il contrattacco anche sugli stessi settori sul quale arroccato il proprio re. (fonte porreca) 5. … o-o (si può giocare anche subito 5. … e5, dato che in caso di 6. dxe, dxe; 7. dxd8+ rxd8; 8. ag5 c6 ecc. il bainco non ottiene nulla.)  come scritto anche sulle informazioni di gknot, scopriamo che dopo questa posizione, esistono diverse possibilità (sottovarianti) 6. e5 king's indian (e85), saemisch, variante ortodossa 6. b6 king's indian (e82), saemisch, double fianchetto variation 6. c6 king's indian (e81), saemisch, byrne variation  abbiamo un amico, stefano (ircmancer) che è molto interessato a questa variante dell’est-indiana. per lui, ed altri interessati apro questo forum sperando di fare cosa gradita.  a questo punto, continuando dalla 6° mossa del bianco stefano ed io continuiamo questa partita cercando di seguire una sequenza di mosse più consona possibile alla variante saemisch e commentando di volta in volta le mosse che giocheremo.  . . . . . . . . . . non ho un gioco irruento, pertanto cerco di non uscire molto dagli schemi dell' est-indiana. d'altronde questa mossa è stata giocata da kasparov e, per certi campioni, ho il massimo del rispetto anche se, in verità, ero tentato di giocare subito h6 per fermare le brutte intenzioni del cavallo di donna. mi aspetto d5 da parte del mio avversario che non penso sia intenzionato ad abbattere il centro che si è costruito.  mmmm... sono molto indeciso, tra due mosse. - 7. d5, prevista da klaus, blocca il centro, lasciandomi tempi per attaccare dal lato di re, ma lascia anche la diagonale libera per l'alfiere di re del nero, e mi impedisce la futura mossa cd5, importante per far spostare il cf6, baluardo difensivo del lato di re del nero. - 7. cge2, che in caso 7. ... cxd4 8. cxd4 lascia il centro aperto, ma con i cavalli bianchi in posizione più aggressiva. inoltre la diagonale è meno accessibile e cd5 possibile. una nota per klaus: secondo me 6. ... h6 è pericolosa, una volta che il bianco è tornato in e3 con l'alfiere e ha messo la donna in d2...  beh, intanto ci ho pensato:  7. cge2  mi ero preparato un commento per d5 del bianco, ma ho dovuto gettare tutto.  oh... mi dispiace, klaus, ma credo che l'imprevedibilità sia una delle tante qualità che, in equilibrio, creano lo scacchista 😊 spero che renda interessante questa partita di studio!  klaus dimostra coraggio (altra qualità importante), con db6 crea pressione e diversivo sul lato di donna, e mi mette in pensiero per il mio progetto di arroccare lungo, e per la possibile pressione su d4. in compenso, allontana la regina dal lato di re. inoltre, c'è il pedone al sarin in b2, sacrificandolo, allontanerei ulteriormente la regina nera dall'azione, ma direi addio all'arrocco lungo. potrei mettermi a caccia della regina con ch4, e alla fine della variante avrei i cavalli in buona posizione sul lato di donna, ma vorrebbe dire posporre l'attacco dal lato opposto. in generale, cerco sempre di stare nel piano originale, a meno di un'ottima occasione.  in sunto, mi accontento del leggero vantaggio di avere la regina nera allontanata temporaneamente, tolgo il vetriolo da b2, e proseguo con il piano originale, preparandomi all'eventuale bufera su d4:  8. qd2   on devi preoccuparti stefano. anzi, apprezzo moltissimo l'imprevedibilità e la fantasia dei miei avversari. vedi ad esempio le mie partite con aurelio, (jrcapatosta), un giocatore che, grazie a queste sue capacità non sono ancora riuscito a battere   devo riconoscere che queste attitudini non brillano nel mio curriculum. il mio gioco, anche se sufficientemente preciso, il mio amico-insegnante di scacchi paco, lo definisce "schifosamente matematico", manca di quel tocco di fantasia in grado di vincere una partita per merito e non, come mi succede spesso, per gli errori del mio avversario. dopo questa piccola confessione, proseguiamo con la nostra partita. penso che dopo aver posizionato la mia donna in b6, posso permettermi di cercare di indebolire il tuo centro. i pedoni in linea sono estremamente ostici da abbattere, meglio farlo subito. penso che prima di occuparti del pedone in d4, andrai a eliminare il mio cavallo in f6 per proseguire cercando di minacciare la mia donna con il tuo cavallo (cd5). sono comunque supposizioni. considero la mia struttura, dopo le suindicate mosse un po' più solida di quella di stefano. tutto dipenderà dal suo arrocco, probabilmente lungo. lasciamoci sorprendere    ho esaminato attentamente la 'variante klaus', e in sostanza si finisce con pedoni doppiati in colonna f e un pedone isolato in d... una buona struttura (per il bianco 😄) nel finale, con il re nelle catacombe, e il re nel finale deve essere in prima linea come harold nella battaglia di hastings (wikipediatelo per vedere com'è andata a finire...). eppure non mi convince, non saprei che piano adottare nel frattempo (l'attacco dal lato di re non va, con tre pedoni contro quattro) e non mi piace, oltre che essere poco salutare, aspettare e scambiare. preferisco stare sul semplice. dopo cxd4, mi aspetto cf6, e portando il cavallo in b3 potrò, klaus permettendo, fare il sospirato arrocco lungo e iniziare l'attacco dal lato di re. la posizione dei cavalli è simile a quella che si raggiunge nell'english attack della najdorf: sembrano fuori dai giochi, ma in due balzi...  9. cxd4   mi lascio contagiare dalla voglia di innovazioni. forzo il gioco e vediamo come va a finire. la combinazione è lunga e tutto dipende dalle intenzioni del mio avversario. gioco cxe4.  presumo che la continuazione sarà la seguente. oltre non voglio rischiare di buttarmi nell'analisi.  09. ... cxe4 10. fxce4 dxcd4 11. axe7 te8 12. dxd4 axd4 13. axd6 axc3+ 14. bxc3  dopo questa combinazione, se va in porto, come potrete tutti notare se la visualizzate sulla vostra scacchiera, la struttura del bianco è molto "bucherellata" e mi trovo, anche se materialmente con un pedone in meno, avantaggiato nella struttura del gioco. prima comunque vediamo come risponde stefano.  o esaminato furiosamente la situazione e le varianti 🤔🤔🤔 e sono giunto alle seguenti conclusioni: - la 'variante klaus' è brutta brutta per me, il nero recupera il pedone (txe4) nella mossa successiva, e poi mi trovo pedoni doppiati e isolati in colonna c... praticamente carne da torre. - mi è sembrato di intravedere una soluzione che mi permetterebbe di evitare i pedoni doppiati, ma le varianti possibili sono tante... meglio giocare una mossa alla volta. comunque la butto giù per reciprocità: fxe4 dxd4; axe7 te8; axd6 dxd2+; rxd2 axc3+; rxc3 txe4 - per adesso devo prendere il maledetto cavallo kamikaze, e lo faccio perché se prendessi con il cavallo rischierei che te8 me lo inchiodasse al re e poi il nero gioca f5...  dunque per ora: 10. fxe4   seguo le indicazioni scritte nella nota della mia 9. mossa.  al momento non voglio uscire dallo schema prefisso. con leggero sadismo noto che ho scompaginato i piani iniziali di stefano. generalmente esco poco dalle mosse di base di un'apertura, ma questa volta, a quanto pare, cambiarle si è volto a mio favore.  per vincere non bisogna giocare solo bene, in questo modo tutte le partite finirebbero patte, ma indurre l'avversario ad un errore o uno sbandamento della struttura e profittarne. logicamente con stefano non siamo ancora arrivati a questo punto.  una valutazione complessiva, al momento, concede al nero quel leggerissimo vantaggio che questa apertura da. il bianco, ha si costruito un centro ampio ma solido sostenuto dal pf3, ma il nero ha la possibilità di sfruttare il leggero ritardo di sviluppo causato dalle molte spinte di pedoni del bianco.   apprezzabile l'understatement di klaus 😄 in realtà ha spazzato via i miei piani come l'asteroide di chikxulub ha cancellato i dinosauri. ma come in ogni battaglia, anche negli scacchi ogni piano non resiste un istante all'impatto con il nemico. perciò, proseguiamo... analizzando e analizzando, sono giunto alla conclusione che: - è meglio mettere pedoni in cascina attaccando quelli centrali con l'alfiere - ci sono varie opzioni, c'è il mio cavallo che può attaccare in modo pericoloso, c'è il remoto sogno dell'arrocco che migliorerebbe tantissimo la mia posizione; ma tutte le varianti finiscono con materiale pari. devo cercare solo di evitare i pedoni doppiati.  perciò...  11. axe7   effettivamente era la mossa che mi aspettavo. penso che a questo punto il sogno di arroccare del bianco sia andato a frantumarsi come la cometa sulla tanguska. la prossima sequenza di mosse, (12. axd6 dxdd2 13. rxdd2 b6 14. cd5 td4 o cc6 ecc.) giocata in un modo o nell'altro non cambierà il conseguimento di una una posizione di pura parità sulla scacchiera. il bianco si troverà con un pedone in più ma isolato che probabilmente sarà la prossima vittima della mia torre. l'impossibilità di arroccare e pertanto una leggera perdita di tempo per quanto riguarda la messa in sicurezza del proprio re. se invece vorrà catturare la mia donna con la sua rischierà di trovarsi con i pedoni in "d" doppiati. insomma non mi lamento    hai ragione, il mio pedone d è esposto come un fante russo davanti alle mitragliatrici della wehrmacht (appropriate le metafore astrofisiche e belliche). difendo l'avamposto o "dasvidanie"? e' il mio busillis per le prossime mosse. conto su alcuni fatti: - la possibilità di difendere il pedone d e sviluppare i pezzi contemporaneamente; - l'ala di regina del nero ancora non sviluppata; - il mio re che, se andrà come tutto fa credere in d2, darà i vantaggi dell'arrocco (torri connesse e libere) con una sola mossa persa; - alcune combinazioni futuribili interessanti; per conquistare un lieve vantaggio strategico. "rodina!"   cc6 da parte del nero? e' un possibilità, ma in questo caso darei al bianco la possibilità di arroccare cosa che, anche se di poco conto, preferisco non dare. ripeto, la mossa cc6 non fa una grinza, e pertanto puoi tranquillamente valorizzare di molto la metafora   infatti il proseguimento delle mosse (dxd, axd, 0-0-0, axc, bxa) produrrebbe due pedoni bianchi in linea a tutto vantaggio per il nero, preferisco però, come dicevo prima, giocare  12. ... dxdd2 13. rxdd2 b6  aggiungo questa mossa che penso, a meno che stefano non voglia suicidarsi, è costretto a fare. inserisco anche la mai risposta. la situazione sulla scacchiera è ancora molto equilibrata e le posizioni di tutti i pezzi, a mio vedere sono abbastanza libere di entrare in azione. l'unico fuori posto è il re bianco, ma questo era il fine che perseguivo.   . .  klaus, se tu avessi fatto cc6, io non avrei fatto dxd, ma 0-0-0, aspettando sempre e comunque che la donna la prendessi tu, oppure ad3, cambiando completamente i giochi. una curiosità: come tua 12ma mossa mi aspettavo f5 e non dxd, ti avrebbe fatto recuperare il pedone (seppur isolato a sua volta… ma passato!), avrebbe sì scoperto il tuo re, ma lo scambio di donne era imminente e dunque il pericolo relativo.  okay per le mosse da te indicate, naturalmente: 12. … dxd 13. rxd b6  soon molto indeciso tra due mosse, te1 e ad3. le voglio fare entrambe, si tratta solo di decidere quale fare prima. l’altra torre, nei miei piani, andrà a controllare la colonna f. deciso: sviluppo l’alfiere in una casella sì difensiva, ma centrale, copro il re, difendo il pedone e, liberando (a tempo debito) il cavallo, e le due torri possono correre.  14. ad3  beh. se qualcuno non sbaglia o non fa una svista, tutte le partite finirebbero patte   comunque la mia decisione di non recuperare il pedone di svantaggio è che considero il pedone bianco in d al momento inoffensivo ed ho l'impressione, che quanto prima il potenziale sulla scacchiera tornerà in parità. si dice che l'erba del vicino è sempre più verde, ma in quest'occasione, non vedo alcuna differenza nel colore. il bianco, nella sua struttura dei giochi attuale, secondo il mio modo di giocare è troppo aperto e leggermente soffocato dai propri pezzi che, pur possedendo posizioni abbastanza forti, sono impossibilitati a muovere senza indebolire la formazione. io non sto molto meglio, ma, dopo la mossa di cavallo, la mia formazione risulta consolidata e rende la casa e5 meno forte per il bianco.  sono d'accordo con klaus, il cavallo in c6 è molto attivo, può raggiungere posti interessanti, e soprattutto può far fuori, senza che io possa far molto praticamente per impedirlo, il mio alfiere chiaro (analizzare per credere), dunque per evitare guai peggiori sviluppo la mia torre e mi preparo a difendermi. d'altra parte c'è chi dice che il 'bad bishop' (come si dice in italiano?) vale meno di un cavallo nel centropartita... la mossa della torre serve anche per toglierle di dosso il mirino telescopico dell'alfiere nero. e poi sostiene lo spavaldo pedone e. ho analizzato anche l'opzione "pedone b2 al curaro" (è sempre lui!), ovvero cb5 o cd5, ma non porta da nessuna parte. che cosa mi aspetto? ce5 o td8, ma klaus mi ha già sorpreso più volte.  15. te1   nuovamente scelgo una mossa che non hai prospettato  , anche se, sinceramente, considerate le sue possibili conseguenze, è pienamente plausibile. contrariamente a stefano cerco sempre di non aprire troppo il mio gioco ma di controllare quello dell'avversario a distanza. effettivamente potevo muovere anche ce5 o altre mosse, ma al momento, preferisco costruire una buona difesa nel modo sopraindicato. se osservate bene la ragione di ae6 e le conseguenze di una sua incursione, dopo una mossa di torre, vi accorgerete che la mossa non è per nulla di poco valore. ora vediamo la risposta di stefano. af4?   ho studiato a lungo la variante "folle", ovvero cb5, proponendo uno scambio torre per pedone + alfiere, lasciando però a klaus una posizione finale molto favorevole, con il mio cavallo in castigo e tutti i pezzi neri in centro e pronti all'attacco: chissà come sarebbe finita. probabilmente molto male per me    la mossa che mi prospetta klaus non mi piace, perché significherebbe abbandonare con l'alfiere una posizione dove controlla caselle utili alle torri e al cavallo neri. l'attacco ah6+ seguito da cd4+ si limiterebbe a spostare il mio re in caselle sicure, dove già dovrebbe stare se mi fosse stato permesso l'arrocco   . preferisco consolidare la difesa con b3, che para la minaccia thd8 o ted8 seguita da axc4 dopo aver spostato il mio alfiere da d6 (era questa l'incursione, klaus?)  16. b3   chissà perché, ma considero la tua mossa un (piccolo) errore. il mio consiglio di af4 era un celato avviso alla mia prossima mossa che, oltre a portare scacco al tuo re, mi fa guadagnare il dominio della diagonale h6-c1. considerati i pochi pezzi che possono intromettersi, è un chiodino (di garofano) che potrebbe infastidirti   dopo la mia prossima mossa di minaccia al tuo ad6 con td8, il tuo alfiere dovrà per forza andarsene, ma non potrà più rifugiarsi in g3 perché probabilmente forzerei lo scambio che, a mio parere, volge a mio favore, ma in a3 posto dal quale non è un minaccia per nessuno.  ricapitolando: 16. ... ah6+ 17. rc2 (penso sia la mossa migliore. non consiglio rd1  ) 17. ... ted8   .  .  sono d'accordo sulla prosecuzione:  16. ... ah6+ 17. rc2 ted8  ag3 è fuori questione per via di cb4+ che guadagna l'alfiere e sbanca. scartata anche cb5, che finisce con il mio cavallo intrappolato in e6. ci sarebbe la variante "giudiziosa", aa3 (l'alfiere tornerebbe utile una volta spostato in b2). ma io sono uno scacchista scapestrato, e gioco la rischiosa e5. analizzando, c'è la possibilità di mantenere o meno il pedone di vantaggio, con una posizione leggermente migliore; naturalmente, c'è anche la possibilità di uno sfacelo    che cosa mi aspetto? interessante è cd4+, seguita da cf5. oppure f6, seguita da... una carneficina    penso che antonio abbia visto giusto. e5 è stato un grosso errore. logicamente per parequarmi al tuo modo di gioco, faccio anch'io una mossa che non hai contemplato.  18. ... txd6, ................mi aspetto il logico 19. extd6, ..................ora apriamo le stalle   19. ... cb4+ ................qui mi aspetto anche il più che logico 20. rb1 (con rb2 ci rimetti la torre per il mio cavallo) cxad3  se non sei d'accordo su queste mosse, scrivimi quelle che preferisci giocare. penso che a questo punto tu debba cercare di scompaginare il mio schieramento eliminando con la tua torre il mio alfiere in e6. questo pezzo rischia di causarti ancora più danni se me lo lasci spostare in f5. non trovi? certo è che a questo punto la situazione non è delle più rosee per il bianco. un finale di torre e cavallo contro torre, cavallo ed alfiere non è delle più auspicabili.   .  .  .  .  sono d'accordo con klaus per quanto riguarda le mosse successive e l'analisi. credo che in questa situazione ci sia una lezione importante per tutti gli scacchisti all'ascolto. difatti, io nella mia analisi, di cui vi ho messo a parte, non ho nemmeno contemplato la possibilità del sacrificio di torre. nel mettermi nei panni dell'avversario, ho pensato come un elo 1750. io normalmente non faccio mosse così brillanti. per contemplarla, avrei dovuto pensare come un elo 2000   perciò, per crescere, pensate in grande! (e imparate dalle sconfitte   )  dopo: 18. ... txd6 19. ext cb4+ 20. rb1 cxd3  sorprendo klaus facendo... quello che suggerisce   ovvero:  21. txf6  penso di avere concrete speranze di recuperare un pedone, e di far valere la minaccia del mio pedone passato. ma non è molto.  logicamente prendo di pedone (fxte6). ora mi aspetto che stefano, che tralasciando l'avventata mossa 18. e5   ha giocato egregiamente, vada ad insidiare il mio cavallo con la sua torre.  tralasciando di pensare al prossimo risultato della partita, vorrei spendere poche parole su questo modo di postare le mosse in bella vista di tutti coloro che, interessati ad una specifica apertura o per capire quali ragionamenti scorrono sulla testa di altri giocatori, si inseriscono nel forum dando ognuno la propria opinione.  ho cercato altre volte di piantare questo germe di interesse, senza un eccessivo successo. questa volta però ho l'impressione che stiamo andando verso la giusta direzione. considero stefano un ottimo partner di scacchiera. mi piace il suo modo di giocare e il modo di esporre le sue teorie.  ripeto che il risultato non ha alcun valore. l'importante è il modo di esporre il gioco e cercare di attizzare il maggior interesse e consenso possibile.  chiunque può intervenire nel forum della partita dicendo la propria e non deve assolutamente farsi restio a dare la propria opinione o proposta pensando che la stessa possa sembrare debole o priva di interesse; al contrario. e' ben spiegando le illogicità che alla fine si riesce a costruire un ragionamento logico. pertanto dite la vostra sia ora che nelle prossime partite dove cercheremo di studiare altre aperture o varianti.   ti ringrazio, klaus, per l'apprezzamento e per i complimenti. anch'io penso che non conti il risultato, quando si impara qualcosa, si vince sempre. e penso che tu sia un ottimo istruttore.  venderò caro l'ermellino, in questa partita, che però ha dato già i suoi utili messaggi. la variante sämisch, tutta d'attacco e contro la quale occorre un incisivo contrattacco. la necessità di pensare con la testa e con il livello dell'avversario. tante metafore belliche e astrofisiche    e' arrivata l'ora dei riservisti... td1. mi aspetto cf2, poi potrei fare te1 e recuperare il pedone, se tutto va bene. cf4 sembra buona per il nero ma non lo è, provare per credere.  22. td1   il mio cavallino, come da stefano supposto, va in f2.  un consiglio disinteressato, te1 da parte del bianco sarebbe un nuovo grave errore. infatti dopo:  22. td1 cf2 23. te1 ag2 24. tf1 axc3 25. txf2 td8  . . . . penso di parlare a nome di tutti, dicendo che abbiamo pensato che fossi giustamente indaffarato con il nuovo torneo, pertanto non hai nulla di che scusarti   . anzi, grazie per l'impegno che profondi.  mi ero riproposto di fare te1? accidenti. questo è uno dei nemici dello scacchista, si chiama “calo di motivazione”. in pratica quando si pensa di stare perdendo la partita, la si è già persa, e la qualità delle mosse va di conseguenza. da non confondere con il “calo di concentrazione” che avviene quando si pensa di aver vinto. in tutt’e due i casi, il disastro è dietro l'angolo. ho esaminato la sciagurata 23. te1 sotto un altro punto di vista, la possibilità di sacrificare il cavallo per un tempo, per poter permettere dopo txe6 l'avanzata del pedone d, c'è un certo pericolo per il nero ma la semplice contromossa di spostare il re in colonna f rende tutto inutile. dunque, tf1. klaus a questo punto gioca ad2. a me non conviene lo scambio di cavalli, perché poche mosse più tardi klaus si ritrova il pedone in e5 e l'alfiere in d4, che si difendono l’un l'altro, in una configurazione che amo (quando riesco a farla) ma odio affrontare, e per giunta in piazza duomo. no no, 24. cb5 ce4, come giustamente suggerito da klaus. a questo punto, sono indeciso tra due mosse. cc7 porta ad uno scambio di pedoni, poi il mio cavallo deve tornare indietro sui suoi zoccoli perché da e6 non c'è dove andare. più interessante mi sembra rc2, che porta il re in mezzo all'arena, dove dovrebbe stare nel finale. inoltre si potrebbe creare una situazione interessante e caotica dopo td1. siccome sono sotto di materiale, il caos dovrebbe essere mio amico. mi aspetto td8 con il nero che propone lo scambio di pedoni.  23. tf1 ad2 24. cb5 ce4 25. rc2  ora è il momento di ragionarci su e proporre un bello scambio di pedoni. regalo il pedone a7 per eliminare quello in d6. penso che stefano forse accetterà. altra possibilità è td1. ma dopo a6 il pedone d6 sarebbe egualmente cancellato dalla scacchiera. siamo ad un momento del gioco che generalmente gioca a vantaggio di chi è in vantaggio. infatti il bianco, privo di un pezzo, si trova a dover difendere la propria formazione delegando ai propri pezzi troppi compiti. in un finale un alfiere in grado di scorrazzare libero diventa una mina vagante. io personalmente opterei per lo scambio di pedoni. un piccola speranza di far avanzare i propri pedoni sul lato di donna, tre contro uno, potrebbe riaccendere le tenui speranze del bianco. comunque vediamo cosa decide (l'imprevedibile ) stefano.   sì, klaus ha ragione, td1 non mi conviene perché, pur garantendo lo scambio di pedoni dopo:  26. td1 a6 27. cc7 txd6 28. cxa6  non mi consente una mossa brillante (almeno mi pare così, spero che la mia non sia la solita fanfaronata   ), ovvero:  26. cxa7 txd6 27. cc8!  , e la torre non può difendere il pedone b6 con tc6 per via di ce7+ . a questo punto potrei avere tre pedoni passati e legati (wow) con la mia torre dietro: un'ottima prospettiva.  l'alternativa per il nero è:  26. … cxd6 27. cc6 (il mio re non può prendere subito l'alfiere per via di cb5+ che guadagna il cavallo) 27. … ta8 28. rxd2 txa2+ 29. re muove txg2  con guadagno di un tempo in cambio del pedone, per difendere il pedone h. direi molto migliore per il nero, anche se cala il sipario sulle scorribande del suo alfiere.  comunque vediamo cosa succede:  26. cxa7  mi piacciono le divagazioni di stefano. certe rispecchiano un certo ottimismo  . io purtroppo sono molto più essenziale. generalmente non mi discosto molto dalla linea o combinazione che mi sono prefissata. pertanto, come programmato in precedenza, togliamo dalla scacchiera il pedone bianco che, in quella posizione, anche se solo soletto, mi infastidiva... la visuale   sono curioso di vedere quale delle molteplici continuazioni contemplate, verrà giocata. un consiglio lo posso dare comunque a cuor leggero. dimentica 27. cc8!  orpo! questa è veramente una sorpresa 🤔 mi sono scervellato per un'ora per scoprire la variante assassina con cui klaus mi distruggerà dopo 27. cc8. niente da fare, non l'ho trovata. o sono un pollo nell'analizzare le posizioni (possibile, coccodè!) o la variante è brillantissima. in questo secondo caso, anche a costo di perdere, la voglio vedere! inoltre, non avendo trovato nessun pericolo pratico nella posizione, onestà intellettuale e curiosità chiedono a gran voce che io prosegua sulla mia linea, coerentemente coi miei ragionamenti; non sarebbe bello cambiare mossa per un ragionamento che non è mio. se sarà la fine, spero che sia spettacolare come l'incendio dello hindenburg. e poi... ho già pronta una nuova proposta per una seconda partita di studio 😄 hasta siempre comandante!  27. cc8  non c'è alcuna variante assassina, solo che, contrariamente a quanto fatto fino ad ora, mi piace scoprire live il tuo metodo di ragionamento sulle prossime mosse. fino a td8, che minaccia il tuo cavallo, il gioco non cambia molto. interessante è ora vedere se preferisci la qualità o la quantità. non voglio influenzarti con i miei punti di vista. forse li riprenderò dopo la tua prossima mossa che voglio scoprire. dopo che l'avrai fatta continueremo a discutere    ora l’ho vista, la mossa per cui klaus mi aveva sconsigliato 27. cc8. dopo td8:  28. cxb6 aa5 29. ca3 td2+  riguadagna il pedone e:  30. rb2 txg2 31. h4 th2 32. tf4 cd2+  salva in extremis l’altro pedone ma mettendo il bianco in una brutta situazione. i pedoni passati ci sono ma la torre nera è dietro, e questo non va bene.  sviluppiamo l'alternativa proposta da salvatore:  28. ce7+ rg7 29. cc6 td6 30. ce5 ac3 31. cd3 para la minaccia td2+  in alternativa:  31. tf7+ rg8 32. td7 obbliga il nero allo scambio di torri.  , perché:  32. … td2+ 33. txd2 axd2 34. rd3 guadagna il cavallo o l'alfiere  perciò:  32. … txd7 33. cxd7 aa5 34. rd3  e il mio re fa quello che a me piace tanto nel finale: si butta in centro a corona bassa   inoltre il mio cavallo è in settima, e non è poco. penso di avere qualche speranza.  ma le variabili sono tante, perciò una mossa per volta:  28. ce7+  una nota teorica: penso che anche conoscendo le conseguenze di cxb6, avrei fatto ugualmente cc8; penso che sia utile mettere sempre sotto pressione l'avversario, perlomeno quando non è un mostro sacro come klaus     effettivamente hai fatto la mossa che speravo, almeno nel tuo interesse, facessi. ora, anche se chiaramente in vantaggio, l'incontro può continuare più bilanciato. catturare il pedone b6 sarebbe stata l'inizio della fine    le prossime mosse sono come telefonate: cc6 ( che minaccia la mia torre) td6 che minaccia a sua volta il cavallo) e ce5, seguito da ac3 (che fa correre ulteriormente questo povero cavallino).  la partita a questo punto si sta preparando per un finale chiaramente in vantaggio per il nero, ma nella quale il bianco può continuare a difendersi almeno fino a quando le armate non cominceranno a diradarsi. allora quel punto chi sarà in vantaggio di materiale probabilmente avrà la meglio. da non sottovalutare però la spinta sul lato di re del biaco con 3 pedoni contro uno...  .  .  sono d'accordo sullo sviluppo delle prossime mosse:  28. cc6 td6 29. ce5 ac3  passiamo perciò alla mossa 30. lasciando da parte per il momento le scacchiere iperboliche di antonio 😄 la scelta ricade su due mosse: cd3 e cf3. entrambe impediscono td2+, ma la seconda ostacola la colonna libera f per la torre. inoltre, la prima mette il cavallo nei pressi del re e del famoso trio di pedoni. dunque:  30. cd3  che cosa mi aspetto... sinceramente non so. è una fase di bonaccia. forse td4, per dare supporto al cavallo? forse spinta dei pedoni g e h?   .  .  la fase di bonaccia continua. ora è il momento di costruire lo schieramento per un finale nel quale, il mio alfiere in più in più deve diventare basilare per la vittoria. mi aspetto ora a3. stefano dever cominciare a far valere la superiorità numerica (relativa) dei pedoni sul lato di donna (non su quello di re come avevo erroneamente scritto).   sì, in effetti a3 è l'unica mossa che segua un piano. ho valutato la possibilità di rompere le scatole al cavallo nero con la torre, ma temo che servirebbe solo a portarlo in c3 o c5, dove probabilmente intende andare, e a distrarre la mia torre dal compito di tenere il re nero fuori dai giochi. che cosa mi aspetto? cc3 o cc5 per ora non servono, e si possono fare dopo. e5? o una spinta dei pedoni g e h? tanto per alzare il fön su questa calma piatta.  poichè penso che stefano, oltre alla spinta dei pedoni nelle fasce esterne, abbia la possibilità di un piccolo raid di disturbo con la sua torre, dopo lo spostamento del cavallo (azione improbabile ma sempre possibile) in e5, blocco subito le velleità interponendo il mio cavallo sulla verticale f. al momento c'è solo l'attesa che il bianco apra qualche breccia per far valere la mia superiorità materiale sulla scacchiera, cosa che, nolente o dolente, dovrà fare   mi aspetto h3 o b4. le armate stanno per scontrarsi?  poichè penso che stefano, oltre alla spinta dei pedoni nelle fasce esterne, abbia la possibilità di un piccolo raid di disturbo con la sua torre, dopo lo spostamento del cavallo (azione improbabile ma sempre possibile) in e5, blocco subito le velleità interponendo il mio cavallo sulla verticale f. al momento c'è solo l'attesa che il bianco apra qualche breccia per far valere la mia superiorità materiale sulla scacchiera, cosa che, nolente o dolente, dovrà fare   mi aspetto h3 o b4. le armate stanno per scontrarsi?   mi aspettavo h3. comunque la musica non cambia di molto. ora stefano inizierà l'attacco sul lato di donna con i pedoni. sono pronto   a cosa miro? spostare il re nel lato di donna e impedire la mobilità dei pezzi bianchi. almeno spero     prima di iniziare l'attacco coi pedoni, sposto il re dalla colonna c, per evitare il 'pin' (come si dice in italiano?):  34. c5 bxc5 35. bxc5 tc6  che cosa mi aspetto? rf7, oppure tc6 che mi farebbe cambiare completamente i piani.  continua lo spostamento, lento ma sicuro, del mio re. sevo spostare il mio monarca sul lato dove srefano è un po' più forte per dare manforte alla mia armata. seguo lo schema paventato anche da stefano... fino a quando non lo so   miro ad avere due pedoni passati e affiancati, via la probabile combinazione: 35. ... bxc 36. cxc5 non credo che klaus sacrifichi l'alfiere per staccare i due pedoni. piuttosto credo che punterà sul pedone passato e. 	 ora aspetto  36. cxc5, axcc5 37. bxc5 td3+  ho studiato la serie di mosse prossime. la mia torre è intenzionata a eliminare i pedoni in g e h, mentre il mio pedone in e diventare una minaccia incombente. se ti va bene fino alla mia mossa 37, puoi continuare proponendo la 38. hai visto giusto. anche perché i due pedoni in a e b non mi incutono quel gran timore   . . . . da diekonige:  ...se a un certo punto ci farete gustare l'avvicinarsi del matchpoint no comment? cioè intendo, è previsto così? in generale trovo questa attività che state svolgendo interessantissima.   non temere, salvatore, il momento del match point è vicino, ormai i miei piani, se se ne può parlare in tal senso, contemplano la "carica contro le mitragliatrici" o poco più. e sappi che io e klaus abbiamo già in mente altre battaglie, pardon partite di studio per voi 😉  confermo le mosse da te pronosticate, klaus, fino alla 37, poi muovo 38. rb4, per tenere il mio re vicino ai pedoni e impedire alla torre avversaria di mettersi alle loro spalle. la mia sola speranza è che klaus sia sufficientemente distratto dai suoi piani, da consentirmi, dopo tc1, di lanciare il pedone c verso le trincee nemiche. mi aspetto re7.  diciamo che la situazione di stefano non è così rosea. rb4 secondo me, studiando le prossime mosse (da 10 a 15), è una mossa debole. ok non compromette quello che lo è già, ma forse intravvedo una perdita inutile di tempo che mi aiuta a incentivare la mia formazione d'attacco. rb2 o ra2, sempre secondo me, era migliore. sposto il mio re in posizioni ottimali. non dimentichiamo che, una volta uscite di scena le donne (come spesso nella vita  ) i re diventano i pezzi più forti.  ora mi aspetto te1 per bloccare il mio pedone sfascia trincee. ma una torre obbligata a controllare un unico pedone non cade in depressione?   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- commento di stefano: ciao a tutti. mi fa piacere avere la riprova che eravate in tanti a seguirci, e che abbiate apprezzato i nostri commenti mossa per mossa. sono d'accordo con voi sul fatto che questa partita ha ormai detto tutto, sia come risultato che come didattica. perciò, se anche klaus è d'accordo, la possiamo interrompere qui. è stato un onore per me! e visto che ci state prendendo gusto, ho una nuova proposta. una partita basata sulla 'modern defence' o 'robatsch defence', in cui la prima mossa è 1. e4 g6, e klaus stavolta tiene il bianco. penso che sia interessante e divertente. ma vorrei sentire cosa ne pensate su questo thread prima di aprire il nuovo.  
-------------------------------------
.la difesa robatsch, nota anche come difesa moderna (ma da non confondere con la difesa moderna - averbakh), è un'apertura degli scacchi caratterizzata dalle mosse: 1.e4 g6 2.d4 ag7  pregio e difetto di questa apertura è la estrema varietà e mutevolezza (anche nel nome). prende il nome dallo scacchista austriaco karl robatsch.  presenta alcune analogie con la difesa pirc, ma, a differenza di questa, il cavallo g8 non viene subito sviluppato in f6, anzi molto spesso entra in gioco da h6 o da e7, proprio per non chiudere la diagonale dell'ag7. di regola il bianco occupa tutto il centro con i pedoni, avanzando a volte anche il pedone f2 in f4. il nero deve reagire energicamente per non essere soffocato. per molto tempo la difesa moderna è stata considerata una difesa irregolare e solo nella seconda metà del xx secolo è stata studiata estesamente e giocata a tutti i livelli: il contributo più significativo alla sua diffusione è stata opera di alcuni fortissimi gm inglesi.  varianti  alcune linee di gioco sono: 3.cc3 c6 4.f4 d5 5.e5 h5 (variante gurgenidze) 3.cc3 d6 4.cf3 c6 5.ae2 cd7 6.0-0 dc7 7.a4 cgf6 8.ae3 0-0 9.dd2 a5 10.h3 cb6 11.tfe1 ad7 (variante suttles) 3.cf3 d6 4.c3 cd7 5.ae2 e6 6.0-0 ce7 (variante dell'ippopotamo) 3.f4 (variante 3 pedoni  . .  ho trovato una annotazione di alekhine che, commentando la partita lasker-capablanca, a proposito di 1. ... g6, ha scritto "secondo i fondamenti teorici attuali, questa mossa non può essere considerata del tutto valida, in quanto il nero si vincola ad una particolare posizione senza essere in alcun modo in grado di ostacolare lo sviluppo centrale dell'avversario..." ai giorni nostri 1... g6 (chiamata difesa moderna) è ritenuta un'apertura del tutto accettabile. con 1. ... g6, il nero diversamente da quanto prospettato da alekhine, non rinuncia alla possibilità di giocare al centro; attende invece che sia il bianco a compromettersi per primo centralmente. normalmente il contro gioco del nero prevede sia ... c5 sia ... e5, benchè in alcune linee il nero giochi ... d5. nella difesa moderna il nero dispone di più strategie. questa libertà aggiuntiva implica per il nero un'ulteriore responsabilità; quella di condurre l'azione centrale in modo tempestivo e opportuno. se il nero indugia eccessivamente permettendo al bianco di consolidare la sua mossa sul entro, allora incorrerà nella difficoltà menzionata da alekhine, ossia quella di non riuscire in nessun modo a contrarstare il centro bianco. (fonte: john nunn - capire gli scacchi mossa dopo mossa)  grazie per l'esposizione e per le riflessioni. (e grazie anche a piero per l'intervento). hai dato un'idea della flessibilità e varietà di soluzioni di questa apertura, che mi attrae al punto di volerla condividere con voi. curioso che l'ampia carrellata di varianti proposta da klaus non includa una mossa che trovo interessante: ch3, dopo h4, con presa di possesso delle caselle f4 e g5 e preparazione ad un attacco sul lato di re. tale attacco può essere un diversivo; una delle caratteristiche di questa difesa è quella di consentire al nero un rapido cambiamento di fronte, mediante mosse come b5-b4 e la mobilità della regina dopo c6 ed e6. per chi vuole approfondire, a me è piaciuto questo video: youtu.be. (in inglese) klaus, cominciamo con la robatsch, dunque 1. e4 g6. se prosegui con d4, io muovo ag7. . . .devo scegliere se occupare la casa c3 con il pedone o il cavallo. giocando c3 si rinforza la casa d4 e si riduce l'attività dell'alfiere g7, ma si limita decisamente l'attività del cavallo b1, pertanto penso che questa mossa naturale sia la migliore al momento. ora mi aspetto il classico d6 per preparare c5 o e5.  .fin qui tutto secondo standard. ora però propongo una piccola variante, c6, che chiamerei "variante norwood" dal nome del gm autore del video che vi ho proposto. tale mossa mi piace perché consente sia l'opposizione al centro del bianco tramite d5, sia un futuro attacco dal lato di donna con b5. è nello spirito della difesa robatsch, che privilegia gli attacchi sulle colonne laterali, e il controllo più che il possesso delle caselle chiave. mi aspetto f4 da parte di klaus, alla quale risponderei con d5, ma non escludo una più tranquilla mossa di sviluppo, o la ficcante ac4.  .la mossa logica dopo la 4ª mossa del nero era cf3. ma questa la posso fare anche dopo quando, dopo ch6 sposterà il suo alfiere campochiaro in g4. pe5 spegne, al momento, le velleità dell'alfiere camposcuro in g7 che è un po' il punto di forza di quest'apertura. ho trovato un commento su quest'apertura che rispecchia un po' le mie intenzioni (logicamente non sono così erudito da conoscere a menadito tutte le aperture e per questo cerco anch'io fonti che mi aiutino nell'analisi delle posizioni  ) "in questa partita il nero opta per la chiusura del centro e mette su un vero e proprio "catenaccio" difensivo. il bianco con pazienza adotta una strategia di lento soffocamento prevenendo le possibilità di controgioco del nero e cercando di guadagnare spazio sul lato di donna, per poi lanciare l'attacco decisivo sul lato opposto."  . . .io ci provo io io io!! secondo me stai già pensando ad un attacco basato su g4 e f5   in effetti questa variante della robatsch consente sia al nero che al bianco di attaccare sulle colonne laterali, una volta bloccato il centro. a centro bloccato, il gioco diventa lento, strategico, e basato sul controllo delle caselle piuttosto che sul possesso. perciò ci sta bene una mossa come h5, che prende possesso della casa g4, e prepara ch6, cf5 e ag4. quanto all'ag7, ora è inattivo, ma dopo ag4 ed e6, sfruttando lo "slow chess", si porterà in e7. tutto questo klaus permettendo   mi aspetto cf3 o ae3.  . cf3 o ad3 sono ambedue buone mosse, ma poiché la prima e la più usata, mi fido di coloro che hanno fatto esperienza più di me    h5 giocata da stefano è una mossa contemplata e consigliata nell'apertura che stiamo giocando. fino a quando non l'avrò capita un po' meglio, non rischio colpi di testa... a quello ci pensa stefano   d'altronde negli scacchi, o si forza l'avversario all'errore (ma in questo caso il fattore tempo, causa primaria, gioca poco a favore di qualcuno di noi in quanto non ci sono orologi) o si aspetta l'errore. appunto... penso che per il nero al momento sia importante sviluppare l'apertura per permettere al proprio re di arroccare. anche af5 non sarebbe male, per bilanciare un po' il possesso del centro senza spostare e5 che bloccherebbe il gioco dell'alfiere nero. ambedue le mosse si equivalono. vediamo cosa decide stefano.  .rispondo con un'altra mossa tipica di questa apertura, che incrementa il controllo sulle caselle f5 e g4, e ribadisce il principio che il nero farà una subdola partita da rampicante sulle colonne a e h. al ritorno di klaus abbronzato, mi aspetto un'altra normale mossa di sviluppo tipo ae3, e a quel punto penso che agiterò un po' le acque. quanto alle note di klaus, ci sono varianti dell'apertura che non prevedono l'arrocco per il nero: infatti l'arrocco ha il difetto di spostare le torri dalla loro posizione di vasi per rampicanti...  . af5 è interessante ma voglio ancora qualche mossa prima di decidere dove è meglio che vada l'alfiere.  .come previsto da stefano, gioco ae3 che è una mossa contemplata nell'apertura e, con questa posizione sulla scacchiera, la più corretta. ora voglio vedere se stefano indugia a bloccare la conquista del centro da parte dei miei pezzi. mi aspetto l'arrocco corto o, ancor meglio, una scalata nella verticali di lato tipo a5. anche db6 non sarebbe male, ma obiettivamente, anche se mette sotto stress il mio lato di donna, mi impensierisce poco in quanto con tb1 la cosa è risolta.  .la casella e3 non è una buona destinazione per l'alfiere, perché io non muoverò certo g5 o c5 per liberarlo. mi aspetto che in futuro si sposti in f2. quanto a me, è ora di far vedere la specialità della robatsch: i cambi di lato. comincio con db6: una toccata sul lato di donna, che può essere facilmente parata con ca4 o con tb1, ma la mia regina è molto mobile, e lo sarà ancora di più dopo e6. tra le due mosse del bianco non so quale preferire: ca4 guadagna un tempo che perderà quando giocherò b5, tb1 è tranquilla ma distoglie la torre bianca dalla colonna del rampicante 😉  ero indeciso tra tb1 e pb2. ora stefano inizierà l'atteso logoramento ai fianchi. pa5 potrebbe essere una possibilità, se prima non decide per l'arrocco. anche ag4, prontamente contrastato da il mio ae2 potrebbe essere una continuazione interessante.  non sono un esperto di questa apertura e pertanto mi affido all'istinto e ad una elaborazione, più semplificata possibile, della situazione sulla scacchiera. obiettivamente sono un po' privo di idee che potrebbero aiutarmi a sfondare le posizioni del nero, ma, come al solito, giocherò contenendo le sue velleità che, a mio parere, giocando sui fianchi, cercherà di destabilizzare la mia formazione al momento così così   (non sono soddisfatto)  .ho esaminato una possibilità interessante, cg4. la variante è: 8. ... cg4 9. dd2 (per non rovinare l'arrocco) cxe3 10. dxe3 e a questo punto con af4 costringo la regina bianca a muovere per la terza volta, mentre con ag4 preludo a un apparentemente inevitabile impedonamento del bianco sulla colonna f (per salvare il pedone d4, mentre ce2 perde il pedone a2). davvero versatile la robatsch!  per lo scopo di questa partita, però, preferisco rimanere sul tracciato classico. perciò gioco la rampicante mossa di sviluppo ag4, alla quale il bianco risponderà con ae2 per liberare la regina dal 'pin'  . mi correggo anch'io 10. dxe3 ag4 11. ae2 evita l'impedonamento  stranamente non ho mai avuto paura delle impedonature. la cosa però, al momento, grazie alla mia solerte donna, non è ancora in vista. avrei potuto giocare ae2 e successivamente h3, ma ho l'impressione di perdere tempo. gioco subito h3 per allontanare l'alfiere in f5 o obbligarlo, come penso sarà  , allo scambio con il mio cavallino. la mossa che mi infastidisce maggiormente è la possibile cf5. una posizione decisamente di predominanza per il nero che farà retrpcedere il mio alfiere campo-scuro. forse qualcuno penserà che logica ci sia di giocare una partita dove i due avversari si comunicano le loro idee. ricordo che stiamo solo cercando di far comprendere quali idee sobillino la mente di uno scacchista prima di muovere e che tutto questo epistolario è intentato solo a coinvolgere e, nel possibile, insegnare a qualche interessato i rudimenti principali di un'apertura e il conseguente medio-gioco.  giustissima annotazione di klaus, e io aggiungo: non fatevi remore a chiedere spiegazioni o a dare suggerimenti. questa partita è soprattutto vostra. e poi magari mi evitate una delle mie cavolate!    ho esaminato l'ardita cf5 subito, ma non si va oltre a un cambio nell'ordine naturale delle mosse. se avessi di fronte un giocatore inesperto potrei provarla per vedere se il mio avversario, messo sotto pressione, commette un errore. ma naturalmente non è il caso   e allora gioco subito axcf3, che sarà seguita da dxaf3 e da cf5.  presumo che poi klaus metterà al sicuro l'alfiere in f2, ma effettivamente il mio cavallo in f5 è in una posizione dominante. il pedone d4 non è in pericolo, per ora; la variante:  11. af2 cxd4 12. dd3 c5 13. axd4 cxd4 14. ce2 db4+ 15. c3 dxc3 15. bxc3  mantiene a stento il pedone guadagnato, a costo di pericolosissimi attacchi del bianco sulle colonne b e d. pedone dunque avvelenato, ma senz'altro sotto pressione. e regina bianca tutta spostata sul lato di re...   e infine una situazione, a mio parere, fluida e tranquilla dalle parti del nero, con la possibilità di completare lo sviluppo con e6, cd7, e qualche sorpresa. . tutte mosse sensate e logiche che mostrano come questa apertura sia accativante per il nero. effettivamente l'azione logorante ai fianchi, come presto succederà anche nel lato di donna, appaga le pretese del nero di far stagnare il gioco centrale a favore di logoranti incursioni laterali. cf5, come prospettato, è una mossa molto incisiva. non devo lasciare l'iniziativa a stefano che, a quanto pare, conosce bene questa apertura che, sinceraente, io non ho mai usato, optando per la similare pirc. le mosse prospettate da stefano:  10. dxf3 cf5 11. af2 cxd4 12. dd3 c5 mi vanno benissimo. solo che a questo punto gioco 13. b4! . .   in effetti io non avevo intenzione di giocare 11. ... cxd4, mossa che trovo prematura e strategicamente pericolosa. difatti tu, oltre a ce2 da non trascurare, potresti giocare, dopo b4 e c5, cxd5 riguadagnando il pedone in tutta tranquillità. perciò se mai prima giocherei e6. la variante l'ho presentata per scopo didattico, infatti ha sollevato un certo interesse 😉  sono d'accordo con la sequenza di mosse fino a 11. af2. adesso ci rifletto un attimo, poi ti scrivo la mia mossa 11. . . preferisco continuare lo sviluppo, consolidare la struttura dei pedoni, preparare af8 che mi consentirà di spostare l'alfiere sui due lati. come detto in precedenza, sarà una partita strategica e posizionale. il cavallo in f5, in tal senso, controlla più che minacciare.  ora klaus si trova, secondo me, in seri dubbi: ad3 è una buona mossa di sviluppo e minaccia il mio wondercavallo, ma toglie la casella d3 alla regina, e allora potrei davvero decidere di prendere il pedone d4; ce2 permette l'ottima mossa c3, ma allontana un altro difensore dal lato di donna; ca4 perde inutilmente un tempo dopo db4+; g4 finisce con scambio di torri e regina bianca in castigo in h1... nelle partite posizionali, si dedica molta energia a minare il possibile gioco dell'avversario.  .un buon insegnamento negli scacchi è quello di far si che le convinzioni del proprio avversario comincino a traballare per qualche insicurezza. la parola minare, come ben tutti sapiamo, in questo caso vuole infatti significare rendere insicura la struttura che l'avversario si era proposto di creare per rendere incisivo un suo attacco in un certo lato, generalmente dove si trova il re o il più debole, della scacchiera. ho l'impressione che stefano stia cercando di fuorviarmi, tipo quinto fabio massimo verrucoso detto il temporeggiatore, con continue, ma non incisive minacce nel lato di re, mentre nel lato di donna cerca di creare una solida base per iniziare da questo lato la vera battaglia. forse mi sbaglio, ma non voglio lasciarmi sorprendere troppo. muovo b4. stefano cercherà di rinforzare la diagonale nella quale è andata a piazzarsi il mio pedone arretrando il suo alfiere in f8, ma io insisterò nella mia idea di far demordere la sua iniziativa obbligando la sua donna ad andarsene dalla verticale b muovendo il mio cavallo in a4. a questo punto molte velleità si spegneranno  un buon insegnamento negli scacchi è

mi trovo ad un bivio strategico importante. da una parte c'è un sentiero tranquillo, dall'altra una mulattiera tra i dirupi. il sentiero tranquillo corrisponde alla mossa cg7: il cavallo torna indietro solo temporaneamente, perché potrà tornare in f5, sia che il bianco muova g5, che g4xh5 (a cui seguirebbe txh5). se invece il bianco non prende ne avanza con il pedone g4, allora mi si crea qualche imbarazzo (ad esempio ad3). h5xg4 porta allo scambio di torri menzionato in seguito, con il cavallo posizionato un po' peggio. la strada impervia è quella tracciata da klaus come sconveniente per il nero. in realtà il giudizio di klaus mi lascia perplesso; infatti dopo lo scambio di torri seguito da dxh1 ch6, supponendo che il bianco voglia aprirsi subito la colonna h con g5 seguito da cf5, ecco che la donna è libera di scorrazzare per la colonna h, ma... a fare che? il re nero potrebbe essere minacciato solo dall'intervento a supporto della torre, o dell’alfiere camposcuro, che sono molto laboriosi; la regina da sola non può fare granché, perché io non ho intenzione di arroccare; il mio alfiere è bloccato, ma la regina bianca è lontanissima dall'azione, e nel cambio ci guadagno. al bianco conviene, quasi quasi, dh3, per posizionarsi sulla riga libera, ma se la regina dovesse intervenire sul lato di donna, il pedone g è in presa. meglio allora dh4, che però non minaccia nulla. io ho deciso: strada impervia. 14. g4 hxg4 15. hxg4 txh1 16. dxh1 ch6. . . . . poiché sappiamo tutti che il numero delle partite in 40 mosse che si possono inventare è stato calcolato essere pari a 25 moltiplicato 10 elevato alla centoquindicesima, il che è di gran lunga superiore al numero di elettroni che popolano l’universo: 10 elevato alla settantanovesima, avevo solo l'imbarazzo della scelta di cosa muovere...   naturalmente scherzo   rispetto il modo di vedere del mio avversario e forse ha ragione. ora l'unico problema, considerata la calma sulla scacchiera è quello di difendere il pg dall'attacco del cavallo. ho deciso di difenderlo con l'alfiere. la mia donna al momento mi va bene dove stà. ora aspetto che stefano si decida a muove un pedone sul lato di donna. e' da un po' che l'aspetto questa mossa, già promessa per tener fede allo spirito di questa apertura. resta ancora valida anche ca6. lasciamoci sorprendere   . prima di tutto, complimenti al matematico che ha fatto questo calcolo, mi piacerebbe stringergli la mano. sei stato tu, klaus?  ora che tocca a me, vedo che nel mio universo ci sono solo tre elettroni: a5, b5 e ca6. siccome voglio fare tutte e tre queste mosse, non resta che scegliere l'ordine, in modo che klaus non me le possa impedire. o in modo che io stesso non me le impedisca; ca6 impedisce a5, per esempio. ci sono altre due mosse più sottili: b6 e cd7. soprattutto quest'ultima mi può tornare utile, seguite il mio ragionamento. dopo b5, il cavallo bianco potrebbe andare in c5, rendendo possibile uno scambio di cavalli in a6 o in d7. siccome il mio cavallo mi sembra più cruciale di quello di klaus, per la mia manovra di attacco, non voglio questo scambio. perciò comincerei con a5, quale seguirebbe prevedibilmente a3 (b4xa5 manco a parlarne, c3 taglia la strada del ritorno al cavallo); poi seguirebbe cd7, in modo da poter muovere cb6 se il bianco muove cd5 senza rischiare lo scambio, e poi poter spostare il cavallo in c4, casella dalla quale non può essere sloggiato se non sacrificando l'alfiere buono. queste mosse di cavallo, avverranno prima o dopo b7-b5, a seconda dei casi.  avevo detto b4xa5 manco a parlarne? guardate questa variante:  … a5 bxa5 dxa5+ cc3 ab4 dxh6 axc3+ rf1 dxa2 dh8+ rd7 ah4 (a 1 dal matto!) dxb1+  e il nero da’ scacco finché l’alfiere non torna in a5, unica mossa che salva il nero dal matto. ma con una torre di vantaggio.  . no, in internet. sono un appassionato comunque dei grandi numeri. un esempio: lo conosci il volume dell'universo in km³ ?

 . . . . non riesco a vedere il colossale vantaggio del bianco :/ d'altra parte, in queste situazioni, si vedono quei settecento punticini di differenza tra me e klaus: nella capacità di analisi strategica. vabbè, se vado incontro al disastro, lo farò da scacchista vero, o meglio, come quel capitano della cavalleria polacca che affrontò a sciabolate un panzer. per la cronaca fece una brutta fine, ma salvò l'onore.  mi aspettavo, peraltro, la manovra di klaus per destabilizzare il centro, bloccato praticamente dall'inizio della partita. ad ogni manovra verso il centro, però, può corrispondere una insidia sui lati; e questo il concetto base della robatsch. pertanto non gioco ab4+, che avrebbe solo l'effetto di mettere il re bianco dove vuole già andare, cioè in d1 (per consentire tc1 senza timori). gioco cb4; mi sembra una buona mossa, mette in presa il pedone a2, e consente la risposta cxd5 a cxd5, mettendo il cavallo nero a fare il pedone supplente per tenere bloccato il centro, ma in una posizione insidiosa per il bianco, con il pedone f4 in presa. cxd5 mi sembra la risposta più logica da parte del bianco; de2, l'unica altra mossa che difende entrambi i pedoni a2 e c4, entrambi insidiati, non va affatto bene per il bianco, chi rischia fortemente di perdere il pedone g4. c5 porta a cxa2, ma dopo cb6 e ta7 i pericoli per il nero mi sembrano finiti.  successivamente, mi aspetto tentativi del bianco di giocare tc1 per attaccare sulla colonna c (previ rd1 e ae3), ma sono pronto a contrastarli. . sposto il mio re per anticipare le cattive intenzioni del cavallino che, a quanto pare, ha voglia di galoppare, ma solo per divertimento. se proprio aveva voglia di trottare, sarebbe stato meglio se andava a brucare in a7. forse stefano ha ragione sul mio eccessivo ottimismo. mi scuso per aver venduto l'orso prima di averlo nel sacco (lo diceva anche trapattoni  ). logicamente sono molto ottimista sulla mia attuale situazione sulla scacchiera. resto convinto del ritardo del nero nel contrastare l'attacco al centro. ora il re nero deve cercare di togliersi dalla diagonale della sua donna. l'alfiere in f2 pazientemente aspetta di balzare in b6, logicamente prima il pd4 deve spostarsi.  a questo punto è facile notare, secondo il mio modesto giudizio, che l'arrocco lungo, che mi sembrava di aver prospettato alcune mosse fa, arebbe sicuramente aiutato stefano.  ora aspetto la mossa che avrebbe dovuto fare prima:  22. ... rc8  logicamente sposterò il mio pedone ariete in c5 e il cavallo tornerà in c6 (un tempo perso?) la sentenza ai posteri  . i pericoli menzionati da klaus si concretizzano se il suo pedone d4 si sposta, dunque è mio interesse: - non prendere con d5xc4, pena aprire la diagonale h1-a8 per la donna (brrrr) o la diagonale g1-a7 per l'alfiere (doppio brrrr) - lasciare il mio cavallo in b4, in modo che se il bianco fa c4xd5, allora cxd5 e 'pedone supplente' (e mia regina su colonna libera) - contrastare l'avanzata del pedone c. perciò muovo b7-b6, e se la risposta è c5, allora scambio bxc e cxd (presumo) e poi tb8 che mette in presa l'alfiere in b5 e protegge b6 dall'altro alfiere. . .una mossa non contemplata da stefano. semplice semplice   il cavallino ha molto posto dove trottare. non so esattamente quale sarâ la prossima mossa del nero. ma qualsiasi essa sia, mi porterà ad aumentare il mio vantaggio. voglio comunque farmi sorprendere dalle decisioni di stefano  acc.... questa mossa non l'avevo proprio considerata. e nonostante l'understatement di klaus, è decisiva. per salvare la posizione, dovrò sacrificare, secondo i miei calcoli, l'alfiere per un pedone. (e mi andrebbe già di lusso). visti i chiari di luna, gioco cc2, e comincio a pensare alla prossima partita didattica. siciliana najdorf con english attack? . consideriamo la situazione... leggermente brutta (per non usare altri eufemismi) per stefano. l'attuale posizione sulla scacchiera denota chiaramente che il gioco del nero è completamente bloccato. ora stefano, se vuole continuare a giocare (cosa che mi auguro faccia per appagare i sadici  ) deve limitare i danni bloccando la diagonale della mia regina con la sua spostando db7. la mossa exd5, come lampante, costerebbe al nero la torre (dxe5+ e successivo dxta8). logicamente ora la mia armata non può fermarsi e continuerò`con ah4+ che costerà un altro pedone al nero. insomma, per il nero vedo... nero  . ì, klaus, l'unica mossa che mi mantiene in vita è db7. ad ah4+, rispondo ae7.  . ho studiato tutte le mie possibilità di gioco e possibili continuazioni.  25. ac6 ce3+ 26. axe3 (una mossa per ritardare quanto il fato ha già deciso  )  25. ah4+ ae7 26. axae7 dxae7 27. d6!  25. ac6 da6+ 26. rg1 e poi?  insomma, sinceramente, vale la pena continuare? se si, muovo ac6. .  ------------------------------- commento di stefano ------------------------------- sono andato un pochino più avanti con 25. ac6 da6+ 26. rg1 tb8 e non mi pare che, dopo d6, ci sia il modo ragionevole di impedire che il pedone d vada a regina, con matto in poche mosse.  perciò, stretta di mano e personale soddisfazione nel vedere klaus felice per la vittoria, e nel constatare che stavolta ho perso strategicamente, senza commettere marchiani errori. un passo avanti.  se tornassi indietro... giocherei b5 prima di a5.  sotto con la prossima! siciliana najdorf, la "cadillac" delle aperture   --------------------------------- commento di klaus --------------------------------- speravo che la partita durasse più a lungo, ma qualche mossa innovativa di stefano ha accorciato le gambe alla partita.  poiché, come è stato detto in precedenza, lo scopo finale di questi threads non è quello di vincere o perdere una partita, ma di interessare i più a scopo di insegnamento, penso che dovremmo in seguito evitare, almeno per la prima parte della partita, mosse non contemplate nella normale apertura.  spero che i più abbiano capito come la partita moderna-robatch, pur portando come fine il logoramento ai lati della formazione bianca, sia facilmente contrastabile se il bianco blocca le iniziative del nero e mantiene solido il centro.  certamente, se l'avessi giocata contro un gm o latri ossi duri, non sarei riuscito ad arrivare al finale giocato e, probabilmente mi avrebbe fatto fare la fine del topo, ma questa è un'altra storia    insegnamento: giochiamo aperture semplici se ci sentiamo più sicuri.  
-------------------------------------
french defence.  a long time favourite of mine in otb play. black's standard challenge to white's claim upon the centre. the tarrasch variation, in my view the most difficult line for black to meet.  also popular are 3.nc3 (classical) and 3.e5 (advance variation). [!?]  guimard variation.  this used to be my stock response to white's 3rd move, and  i had a lot of success with it, even against strong opposition.  i did not use it to initiate piece play by a central break ...e5, but to play lines more akin to owen's defence, combined with a slower breakout with ...f6.  the fact is, though, that there is a bit of a down side to 3...nc6, in that it blocks the thematic ...c5 pawn break.  this was not helped by my clumsy handling of the line during the next few moves. develops, and protects the d-pawn at the same time. attacks e4, and induces the pawn's advance. most circumspect and probably best, though it does make bit of a problem out of the c8-bishop.  5...ne4 is possibly playable, but it is not a move i would be happy to contemplate in this type of position. possibly the most 'natural' move is 6.c3, but for some reason, this knight move has long been regarded as the strongest.  personally, i don't think there is all that much in it. this was a new move for me - not conceptually, as i  used to play it quite a lot, but never so early.  i don't think i'll be in such a mad rush to repeat this experiment.  better would have been ...be7 or ...f6. to keep the knight snug on b3. afterwards i felt that this should have waited one more move, in favour of ...be7. a good development that exploits black inability to strike at it by ...a6.  the threat is to exchange at the moment white considers most propitious, and, apart from the unappealing ...na7, black can't do much about it. as white omitted to exchange on f6, an alternative well worth thinking about was 8...fxe5 9.dxe5 ... (9.nxe5 ncxe5 10.dxe5 c6 would have been great for black) 9...be7 10.nbd4 ndb8  11.0-0 0-0 12.c3 bd7 and black's game looks reasonable enough. [?] what was i thinking?!  the knight recapture simply had to be the better option.  i think i might have had the ...e5 break in mind, but that was never going to happen. the e-pawn is under attack - what can be done about it?  maybe i ought to have carried on, for better or for worse, 11...e5!? 12.bxc6 bxc6  13.nxe5 nxe5 14.dxe5 be7, but the position doesn't look very comfortable.  another idea might have been 11...re8  12.bf4 na7  13.bd3 nc6.  instead, i tried to revivify my game - and redress my earlier mishandling -  with a pawn sacrifice.  had i thought this through more, i might well have chosen differently. [!] this probably did not deserve to turn out as well as it did, but for the cost of a pawn, black's pieces became very active. the move i expected, and probably best.  but white could have contemplated a an exchange sacrifice, here, with 13.rxc6!? bxc6 14.bxc6 ra7 15.ne5 ... with plenty of activity to offset the slight material imbalance. at the cost of a pawn, black's game doesn't look so bad, now.  but a pawn's a pawn fo' a' tha'. 14.c3 was a good alternative. ?! possibly 14...bd6 ought to have been played first. breaks the pin, but more importantly, prevents an exchange that would have scrambled white's k-side.  now there is no question of bxc6 to break up black's q-side. this seemed very natural, but maybe ...qe8, with ...qh5 in mind, merited consideration. this looks good, and brings a rather aloof knight back into the action.  once again, 16.c3, to reinforce the centre, might have been considered.   !?  at the time, i thought this a fine move to bring black back to an approximate equality, or only a very slight minus.  the gameknot engine calls this a mistake: 16… nxd4 17. nxb7 nxe2+ 18. rxe2 qe8 19. qxd5+ kh8 20. bd4 bxf3 21. gxf3 nf6 22. qb5 qxb5 23. axb5 rae8 24. rxe8 nxe8 with a nigh-on winning end game for white.  but black might have done better (after 17.nxb7) with 17...nxf3ch! and whether white takes with pawn or bishop, 18...bxh2ch! keeps black in the game.  to maintain an edge, maybe white would have to retreat 19.kf1.  this is all very well: during the game i barely glanced at the 17.nxb7 line.  however, i could have looked at alternatives such as 16...bxc5 or 16...qe8. !  from here on comes a wild melee of exchanges that wipes out most of the active pieces on both sides, and leaves white with the slenderest of margins. ! well played.  i would have been very pleased had white played 18.bxc5 instead.  black would have at least an equal game - maybe even an edge. !  best, i think.  18...kxg7 19.qd4ch qf6  20.qxg4ch doesn't look so bad for black, but the pawn margin would have persisted with not much that black could show for it. forced, as taking the f8-bishop would have left black the exchange down and a lost game. a tempo-gaining capture that for the two minor pieces, white obtains a rook and two pawns.  instead, 20.rxe2 kxf8 =. !  excellent move, avoiding a nasty threat.  after 21.rxe2?? bxh2ch would have been winning for black. black plans to offer the exchange of queens. marking the end of the middle game phase, and beginning the 'early end game' phase.  almost 70 moves remain to this game, and it might even have been longer, but keep reading.  there will be further points of interest along the way... there was no compelling reason for white to go along with this exchange (e.g. 24.qg4ch was playable), but no particular reason not to, either.  now, with white to play, the game enters a whole new phase.  time to pause and reflect.  white has rook and two pawns for bishop and knight.  according to the standard scale of values, white is a pawn ahead, but practice indicates that (r+2) and (b+n) are close to equal.  for the moment white has no real weaknesses, though c2 is likely to become one.  it can't really be said black has any, neither.  white has a 3-1 majority on the k-side, the pawns are level, and the f-pawn is 'passed' - black can stop its promotion only with pieces or the king.  this sounds good for white, but there is a down side: white will have to look to the k-side only to make progress, unless he can induce a vulnerable weakness on the other wing.  black's advantage is in the flexibility - handiness - of his pieces.  bishop, knight and rook work pretty well together.  i assess the game here as roughly level.  maybe white has a whisker of an edge, but no more.  on the other hand, both sides have plenty to play for, for now.  tidies up the q-side a bit so that the a1-rook can move. centralising.  this placement is fairly arbitrary, but opens the possibility of seizing the file outright by ...be5.  also possible were ...rf8 or ...rg8, as equally active posts. to make any progress at all, white has to do something with his major trumps: his majority and the passed pawn.  this move prepares the advance of the f-pawn. the advance of the g-pawn does come at the cost of leaving weaknesses that black might try and exploit.  this knight move eyes ...nd4 with attacks on c2 and f3.  they aren't much, but white isn't giving much away. partly to place a half-pin on the bishop, preventing ...bc5, but also to prevent ...nd4.  black's options are fairly limited at the moment. taking time out also to tidy up the q-side.  a useful 'waiting' move to see how white will proceed.  note that now the bishop has sanctuaries on d6, c5 and b4, which could prove useful. cagily giving nothing away, and keeping it tight.  around now i was thinking that this game was going to end in a draw.  i felt that i could hold, but that winning chances for black were approximately nil. probing, but also with the idea of bringing the rook to the 5th rank (...rg5), where it can probe more effectively by moving along the rank unimpeded by his own pawns and pieces. white has a similar idea, by the look! had white played 29.rh4, i had intended 29...h5.  normally when defending with pawn(s) minus, i prefer to keep them right back on their own rank or maybe 'up one', where they are strongest and most easily defended.  but i felt that in this game that won't do.  the h-pawn will be used to try and break up white's k-side, or at least make them easier to blockade.  that will require its exchange it the right moment.  as it transpired, the career of the black h-pawn was to take an unexpected turn, later on. attacking c2, the weak spot... good: defending from an active post.  white is still presenting few targets for black to aim at.  for the moment, white is engaged in a close-order advance whilst black tries to snipe at any target that presents itself.  can white bash a way through? h2 is not much of a target in itself, but i simply didn't like the look of ...rc6.  for the moment black's minor pieces are busy closing off the central files, so choices remain limited.   instead, the plausible-looking 31.g4 ... was met by 31...nxf4ch!  if then 32.rxf4(??) bxf4 and, one way or another, black wins a piece.  not even the pin by 33.rf2 will do in view of ...rxh2ch.  white would have to play something like 32.kh1 (instead of rxf4), when after 32...rc5, black keeps the pawn.   however, kf3 was possible. the knight had to move, of course, but why here, and not ...nc5?  no reason, that i can see now: c5 would have been a much better square for the knight.  fortunately i haven't much damaged black's position.  all the same, it starts to look as though white is making progress. closing up the q-side and transforming the weakness at c2 into a strength at c4.  but there are downsides to this.  is a bit harder (though not impossible, as you will see) for white to induce a serious weakness in black's q-side, which right now is very strong.  that tends to localise white's attack to the centre and k-side, where black is well enough placed to meet it. discouraging g4. black tries to hamper the g4 advance.  normally i prefer to keep the pawns back when i am defending with pawn(s) minus, to make them harder to attack.  that policy should probably have held good here, as well.  but i was looking to stymie white's majority once and for all if i could. good move, black can no longer hold up white's k-side. making room for the rook to retreat.  the c5-square does not look at all like a salubrious accommodation for the rook, so i make another square available.. that the immediate exchange by black would have left white with two joined passed pawns unopposed by enemy pawns is less an issue than another file opening up that would probably be of more use to white.  this retreat is intended instead to induce the g-pawn to advance. there was no real likelihood of white taking on h5, which would have suited black on account of the split pawns. ? - during the game i felt sure this was a mistake, and the gameknot analysis engine agrees.  the pawn become a weakness that black's handier pieces, the knight in particular, can just about reach.  a new phase begins, with black making a serious bid for the initiative. immediately driving one rook into a passive position, as the h-pawn has to be defended.  during the sequel, the knight will conduct hit and run raids hither and thither, using this square as his base of operations.   pulling the rook back into reserve.  black will be shifting his attention to the centre, and, given the weak point at b3, the q-side as well.  the threats won't amount to much, but, by inducing a reaction, enable black to make some sort of progress.  such at least was the hope. i am supposing white wanted to get the rook off the bishop's diagonal, and h1 placed the rooks a knight-fork apart (a possible ...ng3 attacking both).    but the rook is also placed so as to defend the b3-pawn should it come under attack by the knight at c5 or d4.  for the moment, meanwhile, white's passed pawns are going nowhere. i do not want to exchange rooks just yet - not unless there is a 'sweetener' in the deal.  what the sweetener might be - who knows?  time, position, material - one keeps an open mind.  after 39...re8?, 40.rxe8 kxe8  41.ke4 ne7  42.f5! with a plus for white.   quite a fight for the initiative is going on.  had white played 41.rd3, then 41...bd6 42.rh3 kg7! looks ok for black. or else 43,rf6 nd4ch  44.kf2 be7  45.rh6 nf5  46.rc6 bc4ch 47.kf1 (or ke1; bb4ch) bd6.  to break the rook out of c6 would have required white to sac a pawn: c4-c5.  probably better than 45.re6 ne7.  but maybe 45.rd5!? would have been worth a look: 45...rxd5 (worth it to break off a pawn from the q-side 'island') 46.cxd5 ne7 47.ke2, and black would have to think twice about 47...nxd5 48.rf3 and suddenly white's two passers are mobile again. with a vague threat of ...rb2 and ...nd4 to attack the b-pawn.   sensible,  defends against the threat and also frees the king from the back rank.   still wants to keep his rook on.  black values his flexibility to continue probes and threats that force white to respond. don't sell easily parried short ranged threats below their value, just because they are short ranged and easily parried.  they are often a means to an end.  the threat now is ...rxf4ch.  black definitely has the initiative for the moment, but can he keep it? by covering squares on the e-file, this frees the minor pieces to move. !? - a wrong turning.  this leads nowhere. fortunately, i was able to rewind, here.  white dare not exchange rooks right now owing to the knight fork (rxd4?? nxd4ch) threatens ...nd4ch.  for the moment, progress for both sides has stalled.  it was beginning to look as though i would have to try my chances after all with the exchange of rooks. heading back to f5 whilst the 'heading back' is good.  forces the rook exchange, and just at the right moment, too. if now 54.rxd6 bxd6 attacks f- and h-pawns both: 54.rh1 bxf5 and white can not play 55.rf1 on account of 55...ne3ch. ! now if black exchanges, the white king is handily placed near the centre. but there was nothing to stop this.  after the win of the pawn black at last has a passed pawn of his own to play with.  possibly white might, somewhere during the sequel, have considered a plan to give up his two pawns on the k-side for black's h-pawn.  then with the pawns equal on the q-side defied black to make good his material advantage.  i spent a lot of time studying such endings that might have arisen, with the conclusion that, with care, white might well have held. instead, 55.re5  rxd3  56.kxd3 bd6 57.re4 nf5. rightly centralising the king.  the f-pawn is safe... ! - in my view the alternative, 57...ng7 is less pressurising, though it has its points: 58.ke4 ne6  59.g6ch kf6!  60.rg2 h4  61.rg4! h3!  62.g7 nxg7  63.rh4 ne6  64.rxh3 nxg4.  could black have won from here, with b and n vs r and pawns level and symmetrical?  i thought the chances problematical, and elected to try something a bit more forcing. now comes some intricate manoeuvring as black forces his way into white's territory. black demands a high price for that h-pawn.  i had set its value, by now,  at higher than the two white passers.  could that value be realised?  let's see! we've been here before, but things were different, then... a tempo gainer.  the king will take over the protection of the h-pawn, whilst the minor pieces continue their operations elsewhere. now the black h-pawn is at least as big a menace as white's two passed pawns,  and white has been driven into a relatively passive position.  but white is by no means yet bereft of resources, threatens ...nd4ch. preventing the knight fork ...nd4ch.  but now the black king is permitted to invade via g4.  but after, say, 64.rb2 or rh3, then ...ne7 aiming for ...ng6, leads to a strong attack for black anyway.  probably best was 64.rh1, which seems to lead to black having to let go the h-pawn to round up the white g- and f-pawns: 64.rh1 and [a] 64...nd4ch 65.ke4 nxb3 (...ne2 might offer more) 66.rd1 nc5ch? (...kg6 is better) 67.kf5 h3  68.rg1! nxa4 (really greedy, eh?) 69.rg3 kh4 70.rg4ch kh5 71.rg3 kh4 etc and a draw by repetition.  [b] 64...be7(!) 65.rd1 h3 66.rd7 h2  67.kg2 bd6 68.kxh2 bxf4ch when black has an edge, but, as earlier discussed, maybe not enough. white has threats of his own!  if white allows the pawn to advance on more square, then ...nxg7; rg2ch wins for white.  this probably represents as good a chance as any for white, but now the game begins to slip away from him.  about now i was starting to fancy my chances of a win. forced, to allow ...ng3 in response to rg2ch (were white to play that). 66.kd5 is the same but 66...bg7 in reply is no check. dual purpose.  the bishop and knight together effectively blockade the g-pawn - or at least have it under close surveillance.  at the same time, the bishop covers the f2-square, allowing the king to threaten the f-pawn. to regain access to the f-file, and so the f-pawn is once again protected (68...kxf4?? 69.rf1ch wins a piece). ! - played to prevent kd5.  i did consider 68...c5, here, but was a bit concerned about the exposure of the b6-pawn to attack. this move leaves the c6-pawn weak, but it seemed to me that it were better to give that one up for the two white k-side pawns than to relinquish the h-pawn.  i was by now valuing the h-pawn as worth a rook.  it was not long before white reached the same conclusion. maybe 70.c5!? was worth a look?  70.c5 bxc5 71.rxh4!? ... and now [a] 71...nxh4?? loses to 72.g7!, but [b] 71...kxh4  72.kxf5 bd4 and black should win this end game.   a little bit of a surprise, this, as i was expecting 70.kxc6 ne7ch 71.kd6 nxg6 72.f5  nf4 or something similar. !? - the alternative was a case of 'as you were': 71...nf5ch 72,ke5, and then try 72...ng3.  i could have played ...ng3 at move 70, but felt that the king was the better piece to guide the h-pawn home. there was nothing better. naturally, 74.rxd4 is hopeless.  but the rook will have to be given up for the pawn.  black has now a winning game - for a given value of 'winning'.  white isn't going to give this one away. now white's next two moves are forced. ! - grand master paul keres once remarked that few positions are so hopeless as to offer no hope whatever of offering resistance.  white realises that he can wipe out black's last remaining pawns, leaving himself with the bare king-bishop-knight end game.  now, if he can force black to give up a piece for a fast running passed pawn, the game would be drawn.  which will be the runner?  white's a-pawn! ! - this is how to force an exchange or the win of material.  immobilise the target, then attack it.  well, black's pawn was immobilised way back at move 6, but the principle is the same.  black will have no pawns left. ! - a useful intermezzo.  even if unessential, one should not pass up a tempo if it will help the cause.  this check means that even after the removal of the black pawn, there will still be an obstacle to a straight run by white's a-pawn.  black will have gained an extra move to round up the g-pawn.  (ironically, later on black 'has' to play a waiting move - a tempo-losing move - but 'time' is one of the three elements of chess: material, space and time). any k-move to the 4th rank would have done. aiming for b7, combined with the advance of the a-pawn.  had black time to snaffle the g-pawn and then to reel in the a-pawn?  let's see, shall we? just two moves and white will have his drawing position of k on b7 and p on a6.  black has, before the pawn can move to a7, to get his knight safely onto one of the squares b5, c6 or c8.  how will he achieve that?   during the game, i thought 84...ne6 would have been a mistake, but in fact it is just as effective as the text.  the aim here is ...nd6, whence he can choose from the 2 squares b5 and c8 according to which is available. edges closer, whilst the knight is being held off by the king.  no use would have been 85...kb7 as 86.nd6ch immediately brought the pawn to book. ! -  ? - better was kd7 or kd5.  white has to be careful himself, here, as he doesn't want his king to be cornered with no escape.  once it becomes clear that black can stop and win the pawn without the loss of a piece, white could at once take his chances in the infamous king-bishop-knight vs king end game.  though it is a winning endgame, it is not so easy.  i have had such endings before - three times, and won all three.  but they were all pick-up games, and from positions a deal more favourable to me than would probably have obtained in this game.  at this point i was certain we were in for my second ever 100-mover, stretching maybe into 120 moves or more.  for the first 100-mover check out: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/great-snakes-batman-a-100-mover?gm=18341  after this, black can not cover both b5 and c8. ? - now was white's last chance to prolong the game... blockade complete.  but it is worse than that.  suddenly white's king can no longer escape into mid-board.  it turns out that white had to play 88.a7 to keep some chance, however slender, of saving the game.  would i have won the k-b-n vs k end game?  i'm about 75% sure i would have, but that leaves plenty of room for doubt. how to round up the enemy king.  box him in and and tighten the screws.  but be sure to leave him with at least one square to move to, until you are ready to deliver the ko. there is always the hope i might get careless and play ...kc7?? stalemate. at this point, white had realised the writing was on the wall and resigned.  the game wasn't going to reach 100 moves, neither - i think he might have played it out otherwise.  it is a forced mate in 6 more moves, which i'll set down as though they were played. a waiting move.  equally effective would have been ...bf2 and ...bg1, or even ...bc5.  not ...bb6, though.  there, it would get in the way. not 94.a7 nb6ch 95.kb8 be5# and not 95.a7 this time, neither, as at once would then come 95.be5#. leaving black with but one move... one of those game that i was lucky to win, with nothing much in it - maybe a slight edge for white - for 35 moves, and even when the balance tipped black's way, it was not easy to see a way to win, even when black gained a passed pawn of his own.  it wasn't until it became clear that white would have to give up a rook to prevent the black h-pawn's promotion that black's winning prospects looked realistic.

esa era la jugada personal. era mejor 17.bd3 y el blanco queda perfecto. la dama en b4 es innecesaria.      parece que está bien el blanco. aquí era prudente mover la dama blanca hacia la casilla b3, apuntando la casilla f7. aquí de nuevo era prudente mover la dama (bien hacia b3 o d2), puesto que está siendo atacada indirectamente por el alfil ubicado en f8. aquí todavía hay chance de recuperación.  este es el momento crítico. pensaba que 23.dxc6 seguía ...d5! intermedia, perdiendo el alfil, pero lo que no calculé fue que después de 24.qb3! si ...dxe4 sigue 25.rd7! y la dama negra debe sacrificarse para no dejar entrar la dama blanca a la casilla f7. lastimosamente no la calculé y a partir de aquí las blancas cometen todos los errores posibles.

today we all know that due to black's premature definition of the pawn structure in the centre white has the better opportunities to gain the initiative. but in those days both opponents were wandering in 'terra incognita' - the routes that were to develop in the nimzo-indian defence were just being formed. 

-------------------------------------
this signifies the grob attack, an opening with which basman is considered an expert.  in fact, a case could be made that basman is the expert in this opening. 	not much literature has been published on the grob.  the most in depth book has been written by basman, expanding on ideas of henry grob himself.  while i’ve never played the grob, i have played against and been beaten by it (but then, i’m better at analyzing games than actually playing them…).  the main appeal is probably its ability to surprise your opponent.  i know i certainly was.  in amateur or speed chess, it can be an effective tool to take the game into territory with which your opponent is not familiar, but at higher levels, black will, with sound play, most likely to be able to exploit white’s lack of development and the space which has been conceded. 	while it does not hinder the development of the king’s knight, it unnecessarily weakens the f4 square, which can become a target for black.  also, the move does nothing to release the bishops or queen, and does not stake claim to the center.  in other words, there are “better” moves for white.  one of two standard responses by black, the other being 1. …d4.  i believe 1. …e5 to be superior for a few reasons.  first, it’s a solid move, attacking the center, not hindering the knights, etc, all according to classical opening theory.  second, it directly attacks f4, the square weakened by white’s first move.  the third reason is slightly more subtle.  white plans to put a bishop on g2, which will take dead aim at d5.  by delaying moving the d-pawn to d5, black robs white’s bishop of a potential target. standard grobbish practice, or so i’ve read.  protecting the pawn which will come under attack when black decides to move the d-pawn.  premature prophylaxis due to a self imposed poor opening choice.  2. h3 does little for development, although moving the pawn to h3 is often desirable in many openings due to it’s preventative nature. with his second move, black has obtained a classic pawn center and released both bishops and the queen.  black’s lead in development and space, while only two moves old, is significant. white’s plan is taking shape.  the light squared bishop will hopefully be a powerful sentinel stationed ominously at his post, but it’s too early to tell at this point.  white’s position is not terrible, but, again, white could have done better.  (crafty gives black about half a pawn at this point) black calmly continues his development. this is white’s first aggressive move that has practical applications.  he exerts additional pressure on d5.  he hopes to either draw black further out (if black plays the pawn to d4), or to bust up black’s powerful center by offering the c-pawn.  if black is drawn out further, he will weaken his control on the central light squares and also allow white to thrust a spike into the center by moving a pawn to e4.  if white is then further allowed to close off the center, he will have a formidable wedge on the qs.  this would diminish the power of the bishop on g2, but he still has the dark square bishop, which he can operate successfully outside the pawn wedge. black accepts the c-pawn, confident that his lead in development and extra pawn will compensate for his giving up his powerful pawn center. a scary looking move, but one that is easily thwarted.  he effects a pin on the knight while at the same time attacking the wayward pawn on c4.  black’s e-pawn is now undefended, but the threat is not immediate, as white is at least a tempo away from attacking the it.  black can calmly address the issue. preparing ng6, which serves to develop the knight as well as protect the e-pawn.  black seeks to remain a tempo ahead.  this move is also superior to nf6, because there remains the threat of  6. g5, forcing the knight away.  this is pretty much the only advantage white has gained over black with his first move. solid development, and attacks the e-pawn. stations the knight on a decent if not ideal square, and protects the e-pawn.  also threatens nf4, which is weakened, and attacks the bishop on g2, on the shoulders of whom white rests many hopes. blocking the c-pawn, which black may have sent into the defenses as a battering ram to smash up white’s ks pawn structure, which would prove more beneficial due to the fact that white’s qs structure is already suspect.  also, this attacks the two important squares d5 and e4, which the gambit of the c-pawn has weakened for black. a solid, centralizing move.  black defends the c-pawn now that the prospect of the battering ram is put on hold.  this also fights for some of the light squares. preparing to move the knight to g5, which is a good square for him, but again, harkening back to the opening, white has forced this turn of events.  any sort of fluidity and see-where-the-game-goes has been lost, and white is forced to attack the qs, even if it’s not the best way to proceed. injecting the bishop into the opponents ks and somewhat forcing white’s e-pawn to stay home.  the knight is the only defender of the queen, and moving the e-pawn pins it to the king.  miles can afford to be aggressive here. getting the knight to its best post given the position, and putting pressure on black’s light squared bishop. calmly retreating the bishop.  the knight still eyes f7, however, white’s other pieces are not sufficiently coordinated to make this threat debilitating. white finds arguably the only other weakness (aside from f7) and places his bishop proudly on e5.  the only nuisance the bishop could feel is if the c-pawn is suddenly freed.  given that moving the knight will unleash a discovered attack on the queen, and that the knight has a perfectly good square to which to move (d4), this scenario might not be as far off as white is hoping.  in terms of time, this does force black to take care of the ugly proposition of nxf7, losing the exchange. the threat of nxf7 is effectively neutralized with this natural move.  even if white were to take on f7, then after 11. nxf7 rxf7 12. bxf7+ kxf7, both of white’s best placed pieces will have been eliminated, and black still stands a pawn up. basman retreats his queen and places her on the b1-h7 diagonal where she is much more powerful, although her pressure is indirect.  white’s attack has fizzled and he has no immediate targets with which he can threaten black. one of the downsides of the failed attack is that the g pawn was made undefended by the h4 push.  seeing no reason not to, miles sends his bishop to gobble up the wayward pawn. an anemic threat at best.  black’s light squared bishop has too many comfortable escape squares for this to be bothersome.  white’s queen is now, however, better centralized, but black’s powerful e-pawn handicaps her quite a bit.  again, this harkens back to the opening choice; black was able to place the pawn there because white didn’t address the possibility that he would. with its mission accomplished, the bishop happily retreats. perhaps a desperate ploy by white, but the attack to the rook is real enough. miles completely ignores the threat to the rook and instead begins an attack of his own. the intent of this move is clear, but in retrospect, as is the case with most things, the real drawback of this move can bee seen… it seems that both basman and miles missed the insidious bf5! which forces the white queen of the board.  14. …bf5! (and the queen is trapped.  if 15.  qe3, then 15. …nc2+ forks the king, queen, and a rook!) 15. qxf5 nxf5 16. hxg6 leaves black up a piece and a pawn.  the only way to save the queen is 15. qg2, which basman probably could have taken his chances with, but after 15. …nf4, black’s attack is devastating. white takes the rook, evening his chances slightly.  he now has his guns trained on the black king’s position. black takes back and needs to consolidate here, or at least, not allow white further into the territory. i’m not really sure the purpose of this move.  it almost seems like a waiting move to see if black weakens himself at all. miles again misses the bf5 attack.  he brings his last big gun to the party, but it will require some maneuvering before it can be effective. basman snatches at the loose pawn.  much better would have been rg1, getting the at-this-point useless rook involved in the scuffle. a menacing looking skewer, but white has a ready reply. of the two ways to break the skewer, this may be the more appealing one.  either way, the interposing piece will be lost to nxd5, and apparently basman feels his chances of counterplay are better with the bishop rather than the knight.  in all fairness, his chances look bleak either way.  barring a major misplay by miles, basman’s attack has virtually collapsed. the dagger in the heart of the white defenses.  white cannot defend both the bishop and the knight. saving the bishop at least, but creating a dangerous weakness around the king, and with both knight roaming dangerously close, the weakness’s exploitability is heightened. getting rid of the interloper and threatening a discovered skewer on the white queen. the true last ditch attempt to attack black’s ks position, and breaking the potential skewer.  it is, i fear, too late for white however. it’s hard to give this move a “?” seeing as how it’s not a bad move, but black had a much more devastating move at his disposal:  ba4+!  after 21. b3 nc3+! (utilizing the weaknesses incurred by the d3 and b3 moves.  the hole at c3 is enormous) and the queen falls.  the move as it stands is by no means a blunder or even a bad move, just not the best. the only move that saves the queen. and black resigns.  he will lose the rook, which held all of his counter attacking chances, and the bishop will fall soon after.   i think the lesson that can best be taken from this match is: unsound openings are unsound for a reason.  even in the hands of an expert in the opening, against proper play, more often than not, the strengths the opening allows the opponent will be too great to overcome.  of course, there will be exceptions, like the karpov-miles match, but in order to overcome the weaknesses, it helps to play like tony miles!

incredible! white is black! it's the reverse michael jackson opening. júpiter makes an incredible naughty move, making baco start thinking about racism. there it is! the queen is wonderfull! the game now has transposed to a very wide known variation of "the greco way of life defense".  jupiter for a moment got scared and started seeing nothing but shadows. but soon he understood the position was not bad at all for him, as he played the following move  baco is know throwing beer on some girls t-shirts while he has fun with his majestic and dog-like staff that he uses to make the girls happier with his magical powers. "the game seems won for me", says baco while he performs acts of disputable reputation on his new met friends. jupíter is now thinking about the new fragrance for men from axe. buy it. buy it buy it.  ok, some guys paid me to do this one, so its ok, im the smart one. wtc (if you are over eighteen you should know that wtc means "what the crapt" without the t). jupiter was running wild one the board! our party-boy baco was now feeling very tired, mainly because he was also naked and drunk while covered in diferent liquids of diferent origins. so he thought the game was one for him and thought there was nothing jupiter could do. pain. suffering. in the clash of titans, it seems that jupiter is dead. lets pray for a miracle. "give me a queen, and i will kill you three kings", said once a person who says vague things. baco knew it was necessary to keep the queens for his personal use after the game. the bohemian gods would not let the hard-fighting queens over the board to spend the night alone after things were done.  so in this move jupiter sees bacos main weakness: his hoes. he prepares than an attack that would hardly harm anyone. this move makes the game crazy. black is winning the game after understanding many socially relevant things about the usage of deformed bacons as ways to become friends with your neighboors cat. jupiter is mad and angry. baco was twisting the nature of the situation with his mischiveous ways, but now he played the move that was later on considered the most brave move in the history of chess. baco was trully in panic; someone was gonna bang his hoes. he had put that little pawn in the h6 square in order to get sober acording to the most lucid analysys. bang. bang. the knight got his hoes. one of them at least. baco is desperate, he cannot accept the fact that he can´t have a menage a trois anymore, because using any of the remaining peaces would sound really awkward. baco decides he is gonna count on his five fingers tonight. exchange is necessary to keep the advantage. this move was made out of pressure. black thought he should do something active the game keeps going, baco misses his hoes. omg. júpiter is running wild. exchanges are good! he thinks. baco was defeated. jupiters persistance and knowledge about baco's psicology and how much he was drunk saved him the day. im gonna take that naughty knight and punish him for being naughty, thought baco as he expressed his most disturbing fantasy's on a public anottation. baco thinks for 45 minutes here.he plays the following line now baco has a headache, he drank too much and the situation is unclear. especially about his stomach. im gonna kill your bloddy pawns, says baco in a fury roar. now jupiter cashes in the prize for his persistance and luck for playing against a drunk sexholic who was worshipped for some reason nobody will ever fully understand. baco's flaw of character seems to be the biggest flaw in here. baco resigns, the game now is a living proof of the blunders some fanfarronistics friends have made when playing against each other in the skys of ancient greece.  
-------------------------------------
the queens pawn opening is my bread and butter. it takes you into slower, more closed off games, which are the type of games i've come to love.  a flexible move which watches over the e4 square and gives black still a lot of options. he's not committed to 1 specific opening just yet. playing this, i was praying that the opponent wouldn't transpose into the benoni with c5. not that the benoni is impossible to beat, but it starts off things far more quickly then i'd like and it has quite a lot of theory. the king's indian defence, black commits himself with this move to a hypermodern defence. can't say i face it too often, but it's a viable option for black. here i was expecting him to transpose into the grünfeld defence. not sure why, he just seemed like the sort of guy who'd play the grünfeld. developing a knight, more common is nc3, but this works too. and now we're playing the grünfeld if memory serves me right. for whatever reason i was expecting e6, but black is perfectly fine delaying e6 or perhaps not even playing it at all. bf4 was also an idea and perhaps slightly better. that being said, it's not too bad. defending the pawn, it blocks off the knight of the natural square c6, but openings like the slav have proven time in time again that this isn't really a problem. he'll develop it via nd7. looking back at it, i'm not sure why i traded. probably to try and simplify the position a bit and in the future take a stab at b7 and d5 with qb3. that idea still needs a lot of work, but you never know in these type of elo's. i think recapturing with the pawn would have been better, since now i have e4 with tempo. his knight doesn't have a good square except f6 so either he trades with my knight or he moves back to f6. this is more or less handing me the center. what's it gonna be? surprisingly he chooses for this option. black gets counterplay via qa5 pinning the c pawn, but if white manages to hold on to the center he'll have a very good game. a good move, which immediately complicates things due to his bishop attacking the a1-h8 file. it also indirectly puts pressure on my previously good bishop, which now doesn't look quite as amazing anymore. this move took me a few minutes, since i was considering moving my bishop to d2 and then following up with something along the lines of c4. i figured that might be a bit too ambitious, this defends the c-file and protects the a2 pawn so my rook can maybe target down the b-file or support the center in the near future. this comes at the cost of my bishop being unable to go back to c1 or d2 and maybe target the other side of the board, but considering his queen is there, i highly doubt that'd be a good idea anyway. if he chases my bishop with pawns, i'll respond with bf4 -> bg3. dxc5 or d5 aren't options since bxc3 means game over. this move took me a few minutes to find as well. cxd4 is met with nxd4. if black wishes to get rid of the knight on d4 he'll have to give his bishop for it or play d5. both ideas are unappealing since e5 indirectly blocks the a1-h8 diagonal and trading literally destroys the last bit of development he had. the plan in which he trades his bishop makes me lose my right to castle after 2 or 3 moves, but i doubt black will be able to take advantage of that since he'll be underdeveloped and have no pressure on the center. developing and putting more pressure. sadly for him the c3 issue is solved so i can put some pressure on it. we have a saying over here which would roughly translate to the following. "when you say a, you got to say b." the diagonal is obstructed once more. that being said, that knight isn't going to be there for long. i don't want him to trade and create a double pawn on the f-file. i might have plans of castling in the future and this would eliminate that possibility. kind of forced to take back the material. this move had me thinking for over 10 minutes. i dislike this type of aggressive play and it blocks off a route for my bishop, but it gets me a tempo and if i get e5 of at the right timing then black can more or less resign. a plan like bc4 -> bb3 -> o-o doesn't' look too unappealing, albeit a bit slow. retreating to the other diagonal offers future to the bishop, but it'd take a few moves. moves which the opponent doesn't really have time for anymore. bc4 isn't bad, but it could be targeted down.  i'd rather not give him even the slightest bit of counter play. the plan was to put the bishop on f3 if things do end up going at a slower pace and then targeting down that diagonal after an e5 push. maybe eventually create a discovered attack. he finally gets the chance to develop this thing, though it doesn't really contribute a lot just quite yet. at the very least he's closer to connecting the rooks now so that they can coöperate to try and stop this mayhem. solidifying the position. i felt like i didn't really need castling anymore as long as moving my king connects the rooks. maybe it's not the best idea to trade off a queen which has such a huge role in my attack, but i felt like i'd be alright. b5 is a slight concern in the distant future, but if that were to happen trading gives my rook on c1 a semi-open file and his pawn on c5 will become troublesome to defend. this is the first move on which he thought longer then 5 minutes. i had used about 45 minutes compared to his 25 minutes. he probably felt like he wouldn't be able to hang on without his queen. i'm about to do something stupid though. optimistic in my dominant position, i thought he couldn't take my bishop since d6 follows. right after i hit the clock my heart dropped. i started stressing whereas he started nodding his head as if he had just seen a gift granted to him by the gods themselves. turns out it isn't quite that easy though. i was about to resign here, when it suddenly hits me that this really isn't as easy for black as you'd think. d6 isn't possible quite yet, but the threat still exists. so e5  makes that threat a reality. a reality he must respond to and just about none of the obvious responses are easy to play. i threaten d6. moving his king away is the first instinct a lot of players have, but it leads to a difficult game. example: 17 e5 kd8 18. e6 qc8. essentially the problem for black is that activating his queen won't be easy anymore. you could do it via 18. ... qc6 19.bf3 qa4. but then the queen won't be there to help defend anything. white has threats such as f5, which  you can't really stop. it leads to qg5 check and eventually possibly to checkmate.  the only way to prevent qg5 is h6 or qd7 ( implying you haven't moved her to a4 like previously explained ), but that gets met by f6. eventually i'll force my way into e6 and both sides have a long game with long calculations ahead of them. this all took me a while to calculate, but i suddenly found a glimmer of hope. if black messes up even once he's done for. my opponent's smile became bleaker and bleaker as time passed by when he came up with this move. this move took him 15 minutes of thinking and marked the first time he had less time then me on the clock. i guess he calculated just how difficult the game would be if he were to move his king or queen so he avoids it entirely by offering back the material. it stops my previously impressive attack right in its tracks. i gotta give props to black here, sure i screwed up, but technically speaking he did stop my pawnstorm. black is a pawn up but white has a passed d pawn. i'm kind of bummed out since my attack of earlier got nullified, but unlike those supergm's we tend to screw up. this game isn't over just yet. the plan is obvious. move the rook to e3 and win the queen. sadly this isn't junior chess camp, people don't fall for tricks this obvious. moving out of the way. his target is qa1. i forgot this was a plan for him, but i figure the reason i forgot was because i unconsciously knew i had bd1 as a defence. yeah let's go with that excuse for not noticing. creating pressure. i missed this move.  there are doomscenarios playing in the back of my head because i realy really don't want to play qd1. then i noticed my questionable bishop on e2. this bishop will end up contributing a large role in my eventual victory. he's up a pawn so he wants to trade. fair enough. getting rid of the pin on bd1 with possible discovered attacks by moving this bishop. at the same time i'm also pressuring f7. fair enough, now he has a few options.  f5, which is in my opinion probably the best option, being greedy and gobbling up the pawn on a2 which leads to a scary qf4+. or moving his queen away to avoid the shenanigans. note added later on: for those interested, i looked at what would have happened if qxa2 would have been played. qxa2 loses for black in every single combination except for 1 in which it draws due to repetition. reason being because after i force his king all the way back to f8, i'm able to just capture his bishop. it's still a rocky road from there, but black was correct not to take it.    black wants to trade pieces since he's ahead. this move accomplishes that since it's forced. if the pawn were to get on d4, then moving his king to c5 will became rather difficult to defend against. black has good chances here, but don't count out white yet. white could play bb3 and try his hand at that kind of play while calmly chasing down the pawn on d4.  winning back the pawn. making a pawn storm on the right side far less scary.  moving the rook also means h7 falls. the pawn on d4 isn't that easy to promote if your pieces can't reach it. i plan moves of kf2, moving towards the d4 pawn. you know those moments where you literally hear angels singing hallelujah because something good happened? this move is exactly that since it wins white the game. it's an easy puzzle but after a 3 hour game of chess and the stress of watching your attack crumble? try to find the winning move in under 30 seconds as a challenge. recapturing is sort of forced. moving the king away just straight out loses. he can't abandon the e8 square and at this point that smile of his disappeared altogether and turned into a face of horror. i kind of felt bad for the poor guy since he's gonna lose the d4 pawn due to this. recapturing on e8 means his king will be too far away to protect d4.   minimum amount of moves needed for the white king to get to d3 or e4: 3 moves for the black king to get to c5: 3. he realises he's too late. the only way he'd get to the d4 square in 3 moves is via kd7 -> kd6 -> kc5 and if i were to play c5 as soon as he does that he can't reach c5 anymore, meaning he'd have to walk all the way around to e5. b6 stops the c5 idea, but it's too late for the pawn on d4. black can resign here. white can just block all the pawns and start pushing his d pawn. if for whatever reason white needs to give black a tempo in 10 or so moves he can do this by what i believe is called triangulation which forces a zugzwang. something i studied in the past. therefore black is hopelessly lost. he continues playing just to see if i were to screw up. the next moves which should be so obvious are gonna take him 45 minutes of thinking. does he hope i screw up or does he actually not realise black can't win here if played correctly? and the ball is back in black's court. 2 options here. push or take. i decided for option b. i think pushing wins faster, but since i'm a grandmaster in making mistakes in the endgame i decide to take. since it seems less complex. black won't be able to play b4 and eventually i'll win the b5 pawn. he can only move backwards almost there. preparing to take on b5 and make the endgame so easy even i can't possibly screw it up anymore. forced. could have played kc6. doesn't really matter anymore, not much black can do. this move took me 2 minutes to make, i think i checked like 50 times wether or not he had a flight square or not. he resigns. with this win i end my opponent's 17 win-streak, so he's probably higher rated then 1590 as soon as the elo updates at the end of the season. in this game i played in a style which was not like what i'm used to, namely i took a more aggressive approach. that being said, i'm interested to see what would have happened had he accepted the bishop without giving back material. my chessteam did end up losing overall, which wasn't unexpected. it's what usually happens when the opponents weakest player is stronger then our strongest player. board 3 lost after just 15 minutes due to insufficent openingpreparation and board 2 simply was outmatched. seeing how i was winning, board 1 got offered a draw since they wanted to secure the overall win. they are 1 out of 2 teams battling it out for promotion and having a tie with us would destroy that possiblity. considering our board 1 player was slightly behind ( even material, but he had more exploitable weaknesses ) he accepted without second thought.

que grande. volviendo a mis tiempos mozos, donde únicamente jugaba 1.e4 lógico. de un italiano que podríamos esperar... la siciliana. y yo me meto en lo único que conozco (de momento), contra la siciliana. el ataque gran prix para dejar al menos los peones doblados y poder atacarlos luego esta jugada me sorprendio bastante. la verdad, lo que quiere es provocar el avance de mis peones para así dar la casilla d5 a su caballo, aprovechando que será muy dificil para mi el control de la casilla d6 hay que mantener el centro puff, esto si es dudoso. lo mejor era enrocarse, jugar ad2 y entonces si jugar c3, pero habiéndolo preparado bien claro, ya va a petarme el centro quizá era más interesante ...tb8, amenazando ...ab4 si tomaba el caballo. está visto que el peón de c4 cae y aqui me lanzo, porque ya llevo en mi cabeza cxf5. y ya sin ideas, me la juego y voy a por uvas. victoria fácil y suelta del maestro italiano. 
-------------------------------------
joer, todo el mundo me juega lo mismo. menos mal que el "baina" de rubén me juega siempre esto y ya estoy entrenado. la amenaza es ...b4 ups.. lo de siempre, al follón en el flanco de rey hay que dar la casilla d7 al caballo de f6, ante un posible g5 del blanco haciendo más dificil el ataque blanco parece una novedad, aunque es la primera opción de fritz. quizá era mejor esperar con la amenaza latente, no lo se, pero yo viendo una posible echada, quería pulirme el alfil de f1, que es el que supuestamente iba a apoyar la ruptura en f5, además de abrir la columna b para buscar contrajuego con mi torre de a8 la idea es presionar sobre la fila quinta, además de apoyar un posible ...e5 o ...c5 y claro, el saballo va a f4 con la idea de evitar cf4 aquí no jugué ...c5 seguido de ...0-0-0, que parece lo más lógico, porque después no se como hacer que jueguen mis piezas. así que opté por esto, aunque parece peor había que pulirse al asesino y esta jugada simplemente la hice para colocar el caballo en c3, y así no dar esa casilla al alfil, que me molestaba un poco más tengo que sacar mis piezas creo que era un poco mejor ...tf8, aunque derivaría en lo mismo esta jugada si que no la entendí mucho y yo a por la columna, que creo que es el tema principal de este finalito hay que evitar que el caballo llegue a e6 y bueno.. con esta "gran" jugada se le cae todo, porque ya pierde pieza y las blancas abandonaron

this is a game which i lost in "berbatov's mini-tournament". i add also the spanish comments by migchess20. the sämisch variation.

 the minus is that white's g1-knight cannot go to his favorite square f3 and the development of white's kingside is "going to be rather clumsy."

[14...cg4 15.de2 cxe3 16.dxe3 txf1  17.txf1] 
-------------------------------------
 the question is whether to play a move like qa6 before or not. it is better because it puts the queen to a more active place and raises the opportunity to get 3 connected free pawns. now, nxc6 is also a possible sac, only it takes less initiative than the sac on d5. i preferred the e-knight to the f-knight in order to postpone the opening of the f-line. migchess20: 29...axf8 30.dxe3 dxc6 31.ch5 ? already here qg8# was possible. ?? migchess20: hay momentos en el partido, que uno se duerme en la posición anterior,( a mi me ha sucedido varias veces) por eso es importante que después de cada movimiento del contrario nos preguntemos ¿ que quiere hacer con esta jugada? observar que piezas están atacadas, que piezas están en el aire. observar las cadenas de peones. hay un ataque directo al rey. 1–0

τα μαύρα προσπαθούν να εμποδίσουν την ανάπτυξη των λευκων.   τα λευκά προτιμούν να πιέσουν το ζ7 αντί να κόψουν το δ3.  τα λευκά είναι μείον δύο πιόνια αλλά τα κομμάτια τους έxουν μεγάλη κινητικότητα.  τα μαύρα επιστρέφουν το ένα πιόνι για να αναπτύξουν γρηγορότερα τον αγ8 και για να σταματήσουν την πίεση πάνω στο ζ7.  ολα τα λευκά κομμάτια έχουν πάρει θέση για να εξαπολύσουν επίθεση.     τα μαύρα απειλούν να κόψουν τον |ππο και ματ στην επόμενη.  με αυτήν την κίνηση ξεκινάει ένας από τους εντυπωσιακότερους συνδυασμούς στην σκακιστική ιστορία. τα λευκά αγνοούν  την απειλή και παίζουν την προπαρασκευαστική ήσυχη κίνηση με τον πύργο! μία κίνηση χαρακτηριστική της ρομαντικής περιόδου όπου η επίθεση είναι σημαντικότερη από την άμυνα.  τα λευκά βρίσκονται με ματ στο η2 και για αυτό σε όλες οι κινησεις τους πρέπει να απειλούν το μαύρο βασιλιά.    22... kc6 23. bd7#

hi everyone!  in this game, a king is caught in the centre and that unlucky king's opponent then takes advantage of the situation by using a pawn to smash open some lines onto the uncastled king.  a certain queen hovers around like a vulture and then descends on it.  but whose king ends up in old matey's shadow and cannot escape?  read on and see. 3. d4 - the scotch opening. 5. …… qf6 - there is tension on d4 and glenda adds to it! 6. …… nge7 - development. 8. ….. d6 - now fou leblanc has freedom in his sights.  later on that h3 square will become a very significant landing base. 10. ke2 - white is forced to move his king. 11. …..0-0 now my rook is indirectly bearing down on the wk. 12. …. neg6 - i want to keep a knight on f4 for as long as possible so sir slugabout comes out to g6 to back up sir lollabout. 15. qxe2? - better i think was qxf3 followed by kxg2 making a right mess of my kingside pawns.  as it is my pawn structure is still intact and glenda is still on the board! 15. ….. bg4 - it looks as though i have blundered a piece but should the wq take off fou leblanc then glenda will deal instant death to the wk on f2. 17. …… c6 - preparing a possible d5 to try and open up the e file. 18. ….. qh4 - again # is threatened on f2! 21. …… a5 - creating a bolt-hole for fou lenoir at a7.  i wish to keep him on the a7-g1 diagonal for as long as possible. 22. nd4 - so he shuts off the diagonal with his knight.  however, my f pawn is just about to go berserk! 22. …… f5 - wait for it! 23. ….. fxe4 - wait for it! 24. …. exf3 - wait for it! 25. ….. fxg2 double check!!!  now - that one little pawn has done a lot of damage to white's position.  white can only move his king as it is a double check.  his best move is kxg2 but he will still go down to a horrible checkmate! 27. …… qg4+ - white waves the white flag as he can only interpose his queen on the next turn.  glenda will just zap her off and deliver mate on g2.  what a game!  i will soon be writing about another game, carefully compiled by one of my buddies but for now enjoy!  kind regards - joanne

um super jogo muito bom.. onde os dois podem ganhar. ao longo, gostaria até de opiniões.  tradicional apenas para posicionar as peças. primeira jogo de ataque, liberando o outro bispo. ok.. imagino que a troca é boa. porém o cavalo não tem defesa. bingo... ameaço o  cavalo sem defesa.  mesma coisa. liberou meu outro bispo e defendeu o cavalo. jogada de defesa. podeia ter igualado o número de peças... será que foi um erro? não sei se foi a melhor jogada.   mas ele liberou para o roque pequeno. libereir o roque grande e ainda ataquei  cavalo. sem escolha... come meu cavalo na troca. preservei  o roque, mas meu peão ficou sem defesa. prefiriu  posicionar o peão avançado, porque minha rainha esta bem posicionada. jogada de defesa? o rei esta com ameaça imininte. roque.. tirou rei da frente e liberou a torre. boa!!! liberar o bispo apenas? inicio a posição do outro cavalo? poxa!! bloqueia a passagem do bispo. e cavalo avança!!!  o meu cavalo ainda não é uma grande ameaça. ele prefere melhorar a posição do cavalo.. opa!! liberou  o bispo. uma boa jogada de defesa... impedir cavalo de avançar. jogada para bloquear o roque grande!!! putz!! essa foi foda!   teve que comer... se deixa avançar, ameaço o bispo e o cavalo.   e continuo atacando!!!  porque sacrificou o cavalo... alguma dica?   claro...uma jogada prevista.. e o não tem defesa do piao o peao mais avançado. claro... não foi sacrificio!! perdi a defesa do meu cavalo.. foi troca. não viu volta duas jogadas. preferi pegar o cavalo dele que tave melhor posicionado e o meu não fazia muita diferença... mas estou em desvantagem de dois peões. ah!!! tava doido ele comer meu peão... ja pensou.. check indireto no rei. não tinha como tirar a torre, é ruim..  o peão dele me defende  ameça dupla no peão que protege o rei  proteger o peão... afinal no jogo peão faz diferença...  não deixo o peão avançar... é uma defesa minha. e finalmente sou ameaçado.  simples defesa... mas ele queria mesmo era defender o peão avançado. pronto. e avanço meu peão. quero deixar espaço para torre. aumentou a defesa do peão que protege o rei.. liberou a outra torre. quem sabe ameaça o rei com o bispo na proxima jogada? não quero prender o rei, por isso avanço e defendo as torres. dito e feito. bloqueou do avanço da rainha. defesa...  peão genial!! merda e começo o jogo com peão!!! avança..  ops!!! não é que virou jogo de peão.. ja tem um avanço regular nos seus peões. apesar de ter dois peões a menos..acho que o jogo ta equilibrado. ameaça meu bispo. defesa. merda!!  não mudou muito.   uma pergunta quem vc acha que ta melhor? ops!!! avanço o peão. ta muito avançado esse peão. recuo a rainha... o que fazer.. ele ta foda!!! porque ele não foi com a outra torre? defesa!!! opa!!! ai meu deus! perdi a torre. como não vi isto? boa defesa e ainda ataquei a rainha. peão maldito !! tchau torre... o menor dos prejuisos!!! maldito peão. agora complicou ele ta com muita vantagem. adeus bispo.. pelo menos diminui o prejuiso!!! e ele vem com tudo!! mas eu não estou morto!! meu bispo preto me protege.  ele vem... meu rei ta fudido. que eu faço. toma!!! jogada de mestre.  uma jogada pode mudar tudo.

-------------------------------------
this game was part of a ruy lopez theme tournament that i started.  i'm not usually a ruy lopez player (from either the white or black side), however there were some idea variations and pet lines that i wanted to experiment with, so i christened a seven-man tournament.  in my first game as white i'm paired with a strong 1800 player. ?! the bird's variation of the ruy lopez.  henry edward bird loved opening eccentricities like this.  black moves his only developed piece, allowing it to be snapped off.  frowned upon by classicists, but as with many offbeat lines, it does contain subtle poison.  i played against one bird ruy lopez before and thought i had a good game since my opponent had isolated double center d-pawns, but my game crumbled grotesquely by move 20 when i tried to exploit them and unwittingly sprung my opponent's pieces (and two bishops) to life. i was determined not to repeat that mistake. the most popular continuation, but 4. bc4 also has its following, which i considered, but ultimately decided on the most forcing move. ?! a very queer move to my eyes, although even mainline bird variations are strange by ruy lopez standards (5. ...h5!? has its adherents, for instance).  5. ...bc5 is usual.  i figured 5. ...a5 was played with aspirations towards trapping my king's bishop with a noah's ark-esque maneuver if i was asleep at the wheel. gaining space and central control.  my idea was to meet 6. ...c6 with 7. be2, and then play d3, ne2-f3, qe1, and treat the position like a reversed classical dutch, perhaps challenging the d4 pawn with c3 at some point in the future, perhaps leaving it alone, depending on what black did. since black didn't play 6. ...c6, i moved my bishop to this more active diagonal and saved a tempo in advance.  i'm threatening 7. bxf7ch and 8. qh5ch as well.  i'm not concerned by the discovered check yet. ?! i though 7. ...d6 was better, freeing his lsb while parrying my threat. after 8. ...nf6? 9. e5 embarrasses the knight back to g8. developing my queen to an active square in front of my rook on the f-file, and covering d5. a natural move, but slow.  black wants to play ...d5 but his king is still in the center and his position is already precarious.    he should play 9. ...o-o and then possibly sac a pawn with 10. ...d5 to uncramp his position. ! now white will very strongly meet 10. ...d5 with 11. f6! dxc4 (...gxf6 12. qxf6 rf8 13. bh6) 12. fxg7 rg8 13. qxf7ch kd7 14. bg5 and white is winning. the fact that black has to play this move proves that his opening has gone horribly wrong. !?  white has many good candidate moves here.  i considered both 11. e5 and 11. qg3; both have merit and strictly speaking are more accurate.  i decided on his move because it basically forces black's reply and i could plan my follow-up with accuracy. 11. ...qe7? 12. bg5 and 11. ...g6 12. fg fg 13. qe5ch are the losing alternatives. attacking development with tempo. 12. ...qd7 13. ed cd 14. na3!, a strong piece sacrifice to mobilize the rest of white's army whilst black's army is entombed behind his king and queen.  14. ... dxc4 15. rae1 kf8 16. nxc4, with many threats to the black position. the b6-bishop is hanging, the f6 push is threatened; something must give. keeping the pressure and daring black to take my lsb and face an e5 push. he does, and i follow through with e5, continuing my demolition operations on black's f6 point, preparing to open the e-file in my favor along with retaking my piece.  quite a position has materalized on the board, looking more like a romantic king's gambit game than a ruy lopez.  but they do call it "spanish torture," as nosferatu saw for himself 500 years ago with torquemada. ? black may not have liked it, but 15. ...o-o 16. fg re8 would have minimized the damage (keeping the white g-pawn in his home intact is actually safer than capturing it and ushering white's dsb and queen in for the coup de grâce).  the text is the losing move, although it's natural for black to want to fight back by opening to g-file to my own king. or 17. ...be6 18. qh3, covering the mate threat so i can take the self-pinned bishop. as the black monarch is smoked out into the center of the board, the black's queen meets her death upon him.  'til death do we part. the last bit of harassment white has to put up with.  black can always hope for 21. kh1?? tightening the screw and activating the remainder of my pieces, since the black queen isn't going anywhere.  black resigns.  a good start for my tournament crosstable, as the bird defense drowns in blood. 
-------------------------------------
 bottom line is white retreats and retreats to a square that keeps the knight pinned. after retreating white is expecting black to develop another piece, maybe the knight or bishop to d7 and if not develop then try to create some room to maneuver, like dxc4. blacks position is cramped. white thinks black does have a few good moves to make, the defense looks solid and white just gave away tempo. all in all it seems to be an even game right now. looks like the middle game is going to be slow and long.  ¿what? chasing away the bishop does nothing but weaken the blacks king side defense. white clicked on analyze to see what the game would looked like if it went 10. nxg5 hxg5 11.bxg5. white liked what was seen and so sacrificed the knight for position. it took about 30 seconds to analyze, move and hit the submit button.
-------------------------------------
 ¿could chasing the bishop away be a fatal mistake? wow, white likes it. whites projected power on the king side is impressive. whites bishops and queen have a clear look at blacks king. black needs to open the position up to move in re-enforcements. white sees the beginning of the end for black. if the queen could hurry up and get to the h file this game is history.
-------------------------------------
  whites thought process is the queen will need to be on the h file sooner or later. white is looking at getting the queen to h7 or h8 in combination with a bishop and the party is over. moving the white queen that close to the unprotected black king and taking over the h file has to be the move. ¿right?
-------------------------------------
 if white was any good at chess people would pay money to watch. instead, white has to pay money to play chess.  ¿what is wrong with this picture? party over. white now sees the forced checkmate. white bishop to f6 then forced checkmate follows. black is too cramped. black resigns.

i am not used to play queen pawn opening, and much less this apporach, but i saw it in one of the games damalfi played and commented, so i thought about trying it out (and against a 2044 rated!). lesson: if you have no ideas of chess opening, you may want to learn first and then try things out. on the other hand, you learn by playing. i wish i could comment on the defence, but, as mentioned, i have no idea. so let´s skip moves till middlegame. now this starts looking like an slav defence, though i am not used to find wb on f4 when i play it with black. i think it covers both sides in case you need to use the knight in on or the other flank. i am thinking about either supporting advance on c4 or play nb3 after 6...bb4; 7.c3. here we go. maybe i should have waited, since i was considering taking the long castling in case black aimed for a short one. i still keep the idea to advance on the black king´s flank in case of castling, and even moving my own king to f1 in case of check (a long future one) this is a move i did not expect, since it seems to open a dangerous column on h. i am not sure about the quality of it, but definitively sets my mind on a shear attack on that flank. better than bxc4. now n in c4 has a strong jump point into e5, while bb3 is still controlling the b1-h7 diagonal. now even more clear to me. it seems to be a duel on knights controlling the centre, since i thought black can (in the future) jump onto d5. but now, bb in c8 is passive while its counterpart on the white side is still a pain... in bk neck´s. with the idea to prevent ng5. which is still valid. now i started to spend time thinking on how to attack here. it seems a really sweet situation for white. but you really have to be a good player to come out with something profitable in a short period of time. otherwise, you lose your time, and thus, most likely the game. i just thought how great would be to expel that n in f6. any suggestions here are more than welcome! and this is all i got. maybe qc2 threatening to double team rooks on h after a long castling would have been more effective. so i remove that nasty defender, but black has now the possibility to counterattack, releasing pawns in "f" and then "e" columns, and opening a path for his bc8 or bringing his bishop here, which is also good. now, it seems we have reached a theme position here, but i cannot find the goldmine. it doesn´t seem good enough, but , as said, i cannot find anything better. now i can think again about a long castling and bring the second rook to cooperate in the attack (although during the game, i did not think about that castling at all...). maybe f5 would have been a nice alternative. nothing clear came after 16.rxh6 i did not foresee this simple time gained, bringing the big guns to support the defence. now white really needs to do something strong in order to win the game. playing defensively thinking about f5 does not seem like an alternative. now the threat is rh8+, kxh8 and then mate with the queen. here we go. i spent most of my remaining time here (and with the previous move) and came with... ...sucha  wasted move. a classic example of "i have seen that if i move my queen to h5, my rook will be lost" and after a few more seconds, you cannot find anything and you seem to think qh5 is a good one. but it is not. end of story. if you guys find an alternative to 19.qh5, please, let me know! i just couldn´t get even a draw position here.

trying to surprise the opponent. although it may look like a king´s gambit, it does not allow for such development. white clearly opens against his rival king´s side, giving up the center, and can result in a weakened white´s position. and yes, i have no idea how to play this properly, and that is one of the fun things of blitz game. a challenge of ideas will develop from both sides. hope you enjoy it. black prevents white from doing 2.e4 and therefore set a strong pawn on d4, gaining control of the center. choosing a financhetto defense. this may be giving white some time to regain control, but at the same time positions bsb on a very strong diagonal a1-h8. allows for wsb to develo. white could have also played g3 with oppossing mirror defence set up, but thought to set his bishop on a far more active position later on (in spite of leaving his king side weakened) blocks the pressure of the bsb on b2 and allows for a development there for white, trying to trade both bishops. interesting. black may be aiming to do f5 and therefore place a strong pressure on e4, although that would also weaken his "e" pawn. this seem to be a bad movement , since it blocks "d" advance. but bsb will go to b2 in the next moves, keeping with the idea of giving up the center while pressuring the side. see that in a potential situation, "h" advance will be a strong push there (in case white goes for a long castling) now this seems to be too slow for black, and also doesn´t help nb8 and bc8 future development. since d5 seems to be perfectly fine, nc6 seems more natural. again, not helping much to the cause of black, since it does have no control whatsoever of any strong square. now, considering its activity on h6, black may be wanting to activate this n, but at the cost of several movements. so now white is facing an interesting dilema. i thought about going for a queen castling and the push on bk defences, or play safe and go for a short castling.  whit this, white is almost giving up on the long castling. too many moves to go, allowing black to advance on a-b-c files. a race i wouldn´t like to run second. now, i felt tempted to do this move since black almost has to go for the trade, or else, going weak on his castling. again, a slow move. maybe white can still do the aforementioned attack idea. but i didn´t. i still have the feeling is a weak move. now the push has to go with less firepower, going for something like h3-g4-f5...which can be clearly stopped with f5. also, black has a very strong jump point on e4. mobilizing his forces. again, control of the centre is the order of the day for black. maybe with ...f6, e5. calling back forces. this blocks the previously mentioned idea, but sets a very strong n on e4. preparing the g4-f5 advance. white might have also thought about qe2 and a future e4 advance, but i had this fixation on the pawn advance as the only chance to get something positive out of this situation. it seems to weaken black´s defence. it kept me thinking about a potential sacrifice on h5, but is unclear. and black may also find attractive the possibility to mobilize forces on the "h" file with rh8 and so on. again, trying to stack forces on the attack. no real threat yet though. see the strong point e4 offers black. but in case of ...f5, ne5 will give white another one, and g6 (and maybe even the mentioned h5 sacrifice) would be weaken spots. maybe a mistake. blocks wsb action, and does not help with the counterattack black is supposed to be doing at the center, although it keeps white from doing nh4 comfortably. i had the feeling that i was simplifying the position without a gain. now i saw that i was giving up a pawn, but in exchange, white seems to have some attack (to be demonstrated though) and black accepts the exchange of blows. this positing consumed most of my scarce time. i had the feeling that controling the a1-h8 with the queen would be vital, but did not see how to gain it yet. now, i did see the next moves, and how bq, if not careful, will be removed from her king´s defence, as it happened. black spent a lot of time with this one. you can see that the queen is sort of trapped, cannot go anywhere near the king nor control the centre. now, what took me most of my thoughts while black was deciding what to do was 20...f5, a weakening movement maybe but also giving black some time to activate his pieces. on that side, look how poorly is bb performing. now white has a beautiful control of the situation. it is to be exploited for the win, but how to proceed? opening files andgetting the best of his rooks, i´d say. now, which one: hxg or qxg... ? both seem tempting, but that a1-h8 was still on my mind, and with the ne4 i was hoping i could threat qf6+ somehow while rg2 moves for the kill. but of course there is a price to pay when you dream your next move in advance, instead of checking all the possible opponent´s moves... nope, did not see this one. was kind of frustrated, but since it also weakened g6 and white has too many active pieces (while black´s ra8 and bc8 are basically dead), it seemed worth keep on pushing. a must. it seems black made it on time, but white still has an ace out his sleeve. !! nice move, keeps the pressure up. white now threats qh5. bq cannot become active by giving some checks, but still could come to the defence with qb5. i´ve just realized that if black had played 22...qb5 instead of ...qa6, this wouldn´t have been possible. threatening the rd8 and also a check on e3. but... now white´s attack is unstoppable. end of game. got lucky with the lost n on e4, but i think the moral is that if you have developed your pieces adequately, you end up having b- and c-plans, even when things turn out bad.

  not sure this is a regular movement here, seemed not too good to me, but... i couldn´t find a countermeasure to it. to avoid having 5.bg5 and 6.nd5 i must admit i was feeling overconfident, and started to pay not much attention to black´s development, but on the other hand didn´t think much about my own, and thought developing pieces would give me an upper hand at the end of the opening. maybe 5.bg5 would have yielded a better defense here, and opens the possibility of a long castling. another movement that slows development , in my thought. there must be many better and aggressive alternatives for white here instead of the castling i did, like ng5, but , again, i didn´t think much of it, i just wanted to finish the opening and not waste too much time in preemptive attacks. but i found myself without an idea of what to do. exchanging pawns did not enhanced white´s position. again, ng5 and then f4 (if possible) seemed more adequate. didn´t even think much on whether taking or not taking the pawn. i just felt shocked and it was that feeling that made me feel like my position was inferior, much worse than what it was in reality. i tried to look for a counterattack , but then, i found nothing; it seemed that black´s king is safe enough to focus on attack and i don´t have much left. it is one of those occasions when you feel like not accepting the gambit, because there must be a good reason not to (opening the column, etc) and yet, it is more than doable (after a light post-game analysis from my side) weak weak movement. how about 9.nh3. it seems better if defense is the plan here (not to talk about, as previously mentioned, nxg5, which is much better) and here comes hell another movement that is not that active, but the shock was still freezing my mind. i was thinking of a counterattack on my queen´s side, but always having the feeling it was for nothing, and blacks attack is unstoppable. trying some sort of counterattack, not sure what to do. and here comes hell not many ideas left, and enclosing the queen, but threats in f3-g2 are too dangerous. i guess that it was to provide n in f3 a jump point to reach g5, but it seems to me that it gives white a respite. o-o-o seemed more threatening, but i may be wrong. taking h6 was not a happy moment for me, but i was running out of time, and thought i could at least activate my queen somehow. of course, black now the 8th line completely open. a very interesting sacrifice. aiming for a7 and moving the queen to a safer position. here is when i spent most of my little time i had left. i thought about ng5!? and or bxc6, looking at least for a draw position, but nothing clear came to me, so i tried a slower but safer approach. i was paying no attention to black´s attack here, aiming for a grand finale with a sacrifice, and  thus didn´t see the incoming attack, thinking queen´s move was a waste of time (i was thinking about doubling rooks on g), but... ..i thought i was lost. threats in g2 and also qxf3 seem way too much. now, under a minute of time left, i found some sort of defense. ! gives some time for me to find a drawing position nice defense! i had no clear end for this game, but it was thrilling and beautiful! kc8 leads to the same position unless or else draw threatening nc7++. i was thinking inc ase of black 23...rf8, what to do, what to do...24. ra7+ with 25.bxf8 doesn´t seem to compensate. i need to bring the queen into the fight there, but how? unfortunately (i think the game was now at it´s most interesting stage) my rival did not see the mate, but it was an amazing player and aggressive, glad to enjoyed these minutes with him. we even tried a new game, in which he kicked my a..s much more easily.   hope you guys have enjoyed this one! 
-------------------------------------
seems a little bit slow, but, alas! i am no one to take advantage of slow movements! not sure if positioning this b here is good enough, since, after next movements, it can be taken by n, or at least threaten. but if  nxbg6 (after several movement) opening the f column doesn´t look bad. maybe not the most aggressive, but i wanted to focus on the white´s king while having a solid pawn defense  on the other side. re1 seems more active, or moving the c1 bishop. again, this is a blitz game, and we always try new things here, riskier. maybe 11...rae8 !? now 12.nh4 doesn´t seem that bad, although still b in c1 needs to be positioned in a better place too fast, too furious; better re7. but i was thinking about taking the 6 line (one of these days). it was not a calculated move. punishment comes fast. thought about giving up. what the hell...it is a blitz game and there is still some attack left. how about 15...nc5!? giving time to black to arm a better attack b in b3 is a pain on my king. but then if 19.bc2, it gives white another strong position for that bishop. surprise. but maybe not that bad. i was thinking about moving my king away to eliminate that bishop´s activity. ...and yet the queen in d1 seems to help my attack. no time to waste, no get away for the king. !? too much attack, and, again, only a few mins/secs to calculate the best defense. good one! 22.gxh5; qxh3!  now that bishop in c1 blocking the r in a1 is quite an advantage for black. now the queen has a strong defensive position. if column f is opened, and eventually there is rxf8+, then queen has d6 or b8 to attack and, at least, find an easy draw position. not sure what is best for black now. both white and black have only secs left (around 1 min each and dropping) anny suggestions? of course, gxh5 helps black attack a lot, thus 23...nxd3 helps sutaining the attack. i was thinking about moving bg6 asap this, as noted before, is a real pain, since n in f6 cannot be moved whithout causing the rook exchange and the queen activity within black´s defensive lines. spent a lot of time here thinking about bg4. didn´t see anything convincing. now i am under 20 secs left. that painful b in a2... this was the best i could come off in these circumstances. leaves the king an escape route...but also weakens the column and now what...? less than 15-20 secs left on my clock. didn´t see a clear prospect for draw if 29...be4+, 30...qxh2 and  31...ng4, since those towers seem a real pain against my castling and d5 seems weak enough to be lost later on. so i felt i needed to keep the queen, if i still want to go for a lucky win. ...and found that the king has a long walk around his lines...can i get something out of it? activating my rook and avoiding changing it for white´s. now, less than 10 secs... what to do? i had the feeling i needed to back my bishop, but not sure where. it seems bg6 might be better choice !! nice one! threats rg1 if gxf6.  10 secs for black... nothing to do? this is the end of the game, but after 20-30 more secs i saw: 34...qe4!  this is why i wanted to share this game. i found it interesting and fun. intention of checkmate in c2, and checks in e3 with strong attack. also now gxf6 can be done. hope you enjoyed it!

-------------------------------------
some sort of danish opening. starting to attack on the king´s side. nice one! it may have compensation, at least, draw looks better than letting white do f5 now traffic will not allow white to find a good defence. in this position i spent more time trying to find adequate spots for my defending pieces. trying to exchange queens and simplify the position. maybe f5 was stronger now, this is a crucial point. blocking with f5 instead of taking seemed safer, but on the other hand i also wanted to activate my bishop in b2. but also black activates his pieces as mentioned, too much traffice here for white. excellent! activating f-column. white looks worse and worse with every passing move. and rook is lost. trying to fish something in the confusion of the blitz game. to no avail. well done, black!  kendefender 1:21  vs.	 sunil1234 	4:19  (o-1)

-------------------------------------
don´t remember how to play against this one. is going to be one of those funny chaotic opening games! sorth of an alejine knight opening here i was thinking of 4...qxd5; 5.d4 not just holding the pawn, but trying to activate my own pieces need to do the castling asap, i think. i was also planning on delaying it and doing it on the queen´s side, but requires too many moves. didn´t see this. i thought 7...nbd7 was a good one, since there is 8...nb6 if  change is not accepted; and if so, black has a strong attack on the king´s side. knowing that black will activate his rook after cxd, but castling seemed to be a priority here. only one left i think. n in e5 is centered but fixed also. threats bc5 and also wins a time to develop white b in b7. but i don´t feel like bb7 is as active as guarding c8-h5. but gaining a time anyways. i didn´t feel like giving up my pawn, but i thought it was going to be the safest move. also i found out (after i made the move) that i had a nice attack if bxd5. and there we go in case of 14...e3; 15.qe2 gives even better chances to white after bxf6 best and only one, i think. with the idea of nf8 or ne5 and then ng3 threatening rg4+ didn´t see this one either; as i said, i thought there would be a n movement here, but seems to work 15.re5 again, 19.rg4+ is the threat good one! i spent most of my time here trying to find a good combination, but to no avail. i didn´t want to end up with one extra pawn only out of this nice position. but maybe there is not much more to do. now r is not pressing on f6 and the check seems to be a waste. queen needs to move and if exchanged, i lose even that pawn i didn´t feel it was enough before! tables have turned for me now. what to do, what to do?... so i tried to keep the pressure up and thought about moving 21.ng4 in case of 20...f5, but it was a complicated situation, and did not see it clear. but instead did this one. seems is not as good as the other one the bad one. the great mistake my rival made in this very interesting game (from our amateur level point of view, ofc) now r in e5 is lost. 1-0 
-------------------------------------
i was aiming for a four knight opening, and found myself facing a complete unknown alternative (to me, i mean). it is an interesting gambit that i clearly did not take advantage of. seems like a king´s gambit, but with black pieces, and that is supposed to be a delay black will recover with a lot of effort. a horrible mistake! now 4...fxe4, 5.nxe4, d5 creates difficulties for white. maybe even losing a piece, not sure if it can be compensated with attack (possibly, including nxe5, but not clear) there are (must) better ways to continue with the attack defending f5 and also activating bc8. a potential long castling is on the horizon as well, in case white decides to go for the short one. an still the threat on e4 is maintained, but maybe black is considering (with good wits) to develop instead of going for a gross material gain. enclosing white b in c1 and also hampering the possibilitie of a safe short castling. so i aimed for a long one, but there was a clear threat now: ...bg4 and then nd4 in case bq moves to e2. h3 looked like an interesting defence as well. i really felt troubled with the static position wq and wb had there in the center, therefore, 6.d4 could have been a good move too, but i didn´t consider it during the game. feeling trapped i thought about releasing some pressure there, and foresaw the incoming combination after 8...fxg3. seems like at least a lose in quality was about to happen (in case of 0-0 or similar), but for those familiar with this type of positions, you may have already seen what is coming next. a classic queen sacrifice!. in case of 10...bxd1, 11.bf7+ and 12. nd5 mate. increases the attack and prevents that nasty check in f3. br in h8 is lost anyways. yep, bf7+ would have lead to mate by 15.qe6++, but black has already lost the game anyways, and did not think much about it. after a few more moves, black surrendered.   the game illustrates how useful are those thematic positions learned throughout our games or study and how dangerous and king in the center is when not defended properly. i still feel bad for my poor opening scheme, but it did pay off the suffering after w 10th movement. 
-------------------------------------
transforming it into an english-like opening. weakeness the center though, which is oppossite to the idea of the sicilian closed variation; it also provides black with an extra move to arm his defenses, but sometimes i like to play this plan. it seems to weaken the castling, but white´s only attack plan resides in moving his king´s flank against black´s castling. gives white a free move aiming for black´s castling and also pinning c5. maybe f5 was a stronger move, threatening 13.g5 in case of 12...e6. protecting b2 and also indirectly c5. also 14.ng3 with the idea of supporting the attack in f5 (15.f5) is not that good anymore considering now 15...d5. opening the g-column for the rook (in a future possibility). maybe exf5 was better since it activates white´s bishop, but it did not seem clear to me. trying some sort of counterattack. maybe nh5 was stronger, but it is difficult to find a precise defense in such a blitz game putting some pressure on f6. i knew i was giving up on d3, but it seemed to me there was compensation, although i had not a winning line at hand. i still can´t find it. not accepting the sacrifice but allows me to add the ne2 to the attack while defending d3 at the same time. still, h6 seemed better. spent most of my time thinking here what to do, and didn´t find anything better. i was eager to get a winning attack. 21. h4, nh7 doesn´t seem to help me much. now this seemed to be the wrong one here in the game. still 21...nh7 looked good to me, with the idea of f6, closing the case. cannot be taken with queen, thus, black´s king is on the move for awhile impeding f6 and also constricting black´s space. on the other hand, although n in h5 seems to be a good defender, holding that wing, it lacks attacking performance. trying to activate my bishop. maybe d4 with the idea of placing my rooks on the attack in d column was better. nxf3 doesn´t seem to be a good option, since it will remove black´s active n. now it seems clear white needs to attack on the queen´s side. white´s n in h5 seems even less useful now, but white rooks are more appealing than those of black´s maybe a waste of time, maybe not. here we go. black now needs to place his rooks on the defense, including that on f8 that seems to be extremely passive. threatening bxg4 and gaining a pawn doesn´t seem to be the best defense, as mentioned, black needs to prepare the defense on the queen side of the board. i was preparing this move (as mentioned previously) way ahead of this position, but now n in g6 makes it even easier. blocks white´s queen g3-d6 control and also opens g column for a counterattack. also, after 31.nxf4 gxf4; 32.qxf4, bxf5, white pawns in f column doesn´t seem to compensate that extra pawn. but in that case, i was thinking about: 33.d (or b)xc5! threatening mate in two (or else losing rook in f8 after white check on d6. and so it went, although now rook cannot be taken. still not sure if black can compensate after 34...bd7 since white´s rooks seem to be extremely active. it would have been interesting to follow that line. in these few minutes of light analysis i can´t find a clear winning line, with, for example, 34...bd7; 35.qxd6+, kd8 and careful now; there is always the possibility of ...qb8 or qc7 to exchange queens or even threatening mate. so, 36. qe7+, kc7; 37.cxb6+ kxb6 cannot be continued with qxf7 because of 38...qc7+ and 39...qg3 etc. opening the b-column. now white´s attack cannot be stopped with bd7 black surrenders.   i still have the feeling that white had a better attack before, but i couldn´t find a better line, so it is up to you guys to resolve the middle game resolution. 
-------------------------------------
a blitz game i memorized. (played on gameknot) 2...d5 would have been favourable for white in view of 3.cxd5 nxd5 4.e4. one of the key elements of the nimzo-indian is the bishop on b4. and now one of the most straightforward replies is the rubinstein variation (4.e3), in which white ignores black's 'threats' and simply gets on with the process of developing his remaining pieces. basically one of the three main options for black here. the other two are 4...b6 and 4...o-o. this is a very common move in the nimzo-indian. another possibility is 5.bd3 with for instance the so called h�bner variation 5...nc6 6.nf3 bxc3  7.bxc3 d6 8.o-o etc. 5...cxd4 is more common here. the text-move caught me a bit off guard. ? 6.qc2 is usually played now, with the most likely continuation 6...cxd4 7.exd4 d5 8.a3  i expected the exchange, but actually 6...qf6 is a nice alternative and can already be played here, though 7.f3 nxc3 8.nxc3 bxc3 leads to an even position. developing my queen and attacking the knight on e4. defends the knight and gains more control in the centre. taking one of blacks central pawns. maybe 8...nxc3 should have been tried, 9.nxc3 cxd4 10.qa5  nd7 11.exd4 and then 11...exd5 it seems odd to take 'away form the centre', but of course i win a pawn and leave black with an isolated pawn on d5 . this queen move increases pressure on c3 and threatens the f2 pawn. !? to be honest, i played this move instantly, focusing too much on c3 and only then did i see the f2 threat! instead 10.f3 was forced of course. that's what can happen in a blitz game late at night :) ?? now black played instantly and blunders, 11...nxc3  was almost forced. but again i miss the strongest continuation: 12.nxd5! which wins for white here. (attacking both the knight and bishop) 12...bf5 13.nxc7  ke7 14.nd5  (14.nxa8? is not so good: 14...rd8  15.bd2 qxe3) 14...kf8 15.ndc3 and white comes out a a bishop and a pawn ahead. at least i'm winning a pawn again and now the black king is in an ugly position. ?? this move spells disaster for black. 13...kf8 14.nd4 nc6 and white is better of course. and black resigned, which i think was a bit premature. he could have tried 14...be5 where white has to be really careful: 15.kc2 (forced) 15...bxa1 16.qxa8 bf5  17.kd1 0-0 but this leaves black two pawns behind and something like 18.qf3 wins for white. time left on the clock -  white: 8:08 - black:7:56

maybe too soon to open here i love n in b3 defending and not being attacked by black´s bishops, but... i let that idea run in my mind without questioning it now white bishop should be located in d3 to be active, but somehow my plan is fouled from the start. however, bd3 is open now. black counteracts where it has more chances. my nb3 is thereatened and i see no good defense, i may have to give up on b2. spent a few secs here deciding what to do. i feel contrained. there we go, trying to move pieces onto the king´s wing. b2 may be worth the sacrifice. black thought on this for awhile, is not easy to decide whether it is worth or not taking on b2. on the other hand, queen seems to be relative safe here. i started to make fast movements trying not to let black have a clear idea of what to do. i am not trying to attack on the queen´s but on the king´s wing. i was expecting 14...f5 straight. or maybe 14..qc3 (not that good). i had to think now more than i wanted to decide to do the net attack (or not to do) it seems interesting at least. if not taken, compesnates the lost pawn and leaves a hole to make progress in a future attack. i´d even say black needs to accept the sacrifice, otherwise bq will go onto h5 the second one hurt me more to make it, since i really did not see a clear line to win the game, although the position seemed ripe to try it: i will open f column and have an strong attack. however, black can return material several ways, and thus may achieve compensation. now the threat is g6. i spent most of the remaining time thinking on what to do in case of 18...qc3 (threatening b in e3 and then bringing the queen near the castling to reinforce defense; or even n3xd5. i still have the feeling black can find a defense here, but maybe this doesn´t solve black´s problems, i´d say it is even making them worse: now if qc3, it is doable rf3 now the attack is unstoppable. i was thinking what to do in case of n3xe5 or nf6  
-------------------------------------
not a classic indian defense. no idea why i did it, but thought it was going to be fun, and that´s why we are here, aren´t we!? and the fun commences! this was the idea, after all. no need for that pawn when you can load your bishop against k castling (future) with the idea to support e4 and also bringing it closer to the king´s side. all most logical, now the idea for black would be to attack on his queen´s (obviously, with that extra pawn and the whole column open) while wrestling on his king´s white´s, on the other side is basically betting on attacking on the castling and holding both his left wing and the center (considering even maintaining the king there) consolidates the superiority on the queen´s side but also fixes somehow the center and opens the a1-h8 highway for white to attack. maybe uneeded, considering  next move, but i thought i was gaining one time (which in the end was not that useful at all). maybe qc2 woould have yielded better results. as i said, it seems for white to have gained one time, but now b can return to his post and defend, along with nf6 the h5 spot. didn´t like what i had, i was stalling somehow. as i said. now black has most of his castling holding together and should start focusing on developing his queen´s side. with the idea to remove b in g4 using nh2 and advancing pawns on that side. as mentioned before, i thought black would be developing his pieces and attacking on my queen´s side, but instead it came out with an interesting counterattack i did not predict at all. and in a blitz game that might be half a game won. sticking to my plan. now the queen comes to the first line. didn´t see (or at least the whole chain of movements) the next 14...b3, and as i liked my n in d3, i did not consider to defend with nb3. i think i was wrong. i continued with the attack. i had confidence that after ...b3 i could recover the pawn without major loss, since b in g4 is now threatened. ...but then i saw (or thought) that if 15.axb3, then bxd2+ i was going to exchange my rooks for the queen (which is not that bad at all, considering i keep my bb2 and the queen, and also the threat in g4 -which didn´t seem clear during the game-) and felt like not doing it. so i thought about defending better, which is a mistake, but a safer approach (at least at that time) now again, since bg5 is threatened, black cannot either gain the "sacrificed" pawn by bxa2. this makes things easier, since now both rooks will be connected. now 17.bxd2? would be a grave mistake, because of rxa2 and my pawn is back. both bbb8 and wbh2 seem to be ill-positioned. a run for a better place will take place, but white´s rooks seem to have the upperhand on a-column, and the pair of bishops might be more efficient here if i can attack on f5. if 18...na6, then 19.ra2 closing the couln, but keeping the n diplaced from the center to cover 21...nf4 with the idea of ...nc7, but then that knight seem to be far away from the action. i was thinking on weakening black´s by advancing onto f5, as i said, but first i have to hold g4, and that will require time. didn´t like it very much, since i lose a supporting pawn for f5, but it also prevents black´s ...f5 frees space for bd3 and also for b holding a1-h8 now we have to be careful with the potential check on c2. to avoid an undesired exchange now here comes the most interesting thing: black´s doubled pawn in f-column would not be so weak if supported by d6 and the danger in c2 persists, which may look like a gained time for black. but no, since that pawn can reach  d8 without being stopped in case of nc2+. therefore, the weakened black pawns will now have to face white´s king and wb seems to be stronger than bn. now the threat is be7. kf8 seems to be a must here. giving time for white to attack on d6 interesting sacrifice! activates bk. in case now of 34.gxf6, white weakens his chain of pawns. i rather keep on  attacking d6, which will make wd5 a strong pawn (and also we have to consider that d8 is a black square and can therefore be dominated by wb) yes,  maybe i should have advanced the king, but this seemd to be ok as well. the rest of the game is just about playing with the extra times white has because of his gained pawns, even when i did not played well there, moving the bishop instead of bringing the king forward. f5 cannot be defended, since 38...ng6 follows 39.h5+ and then pawn in f6 will crown. blocking g6 for black. now wk has to move either to e5 or e6 to support his pawns or finish black´s on c and b ...and god knows why i did not move the king. wasted time. blocking my plan b. another wasted time. f4 would have been easier. but eventually, material superiority has this advantages and my previous mistake can be amended. end of story. i was fun, and again, considering it was a blitz game, it was not that bad at all! 
-------------------------------------
so we are aiming for a indian defence. trying not to block f3 point. i have seen positions like the one we are playing that wither advance there with f4, or block moving f2-f3 and then focus on the queen side. i am more prone to attack the king, but this time, i will go for a slower approach. didn´t think of this, was kind of a surprise, but it hampers somehow my idea to advance on the queen side. but it also seems to me that creates a weakness (that i did not exploit properly) as i said, with this i prevent a potential ...ng4 (threatening my bishop in e3 if moved there) and then...f5 did not think much of my bb in d3, since it doesn´t seem to help defending nor attacking the black king, although it does support my advance on the left flank. maybe i should have saved it, but thought i needed to gain some moves in order to make progress. be3 seems good enough. it does even support a more flexible attack on either side of the board. with the idea of c5 maybe? i thought so, and didn´t like it, but i did not considered that after ...c5: dxc, d column is open and e6 is a weak point to attack. shame on me (i just saw that, during this analysis) to support "b4" and then "c5" advances. interesting. but it may again create a weak pawn difficult to defend. maybe 13.nb5 was more effective, with the idea of 14.nec3 and qc2, attacking a4 starting the grand opening characteristic of this indian variant. after playing this, i realized it doesn´t do much; it does defend a3 and opens the 3 line for the rook in case it needs to join the defence, but nothing else. continuing with the good plan. black now has two approaches: fxe (the game) or f4 and then moving the rest of g and h pawns to attack the king. it is a solid attack. i wanted to remove my rook from a1 since there was a future capture with the bishop in g7 (way ahead, i know, but i wanted to prevent it), and supporting a putative sacrifice (that at this point i did not see clear at all). but i should have stuck to a different plan: if not interested in defence, at least let´s create some trouble, advancing through "a" column. or  else joined the defence on f1. trying to support n in f4. had the white not removed the rook from a1, now a direct nf4 would have been possible. at this time, i felt sort of at a crossroads: either defend my king, and i had the feeling it was sort of late (i should have started a few moves back) or committing my pieces to attack the left flank. and i saw what i thought it was an interesting sacrifice. it took me more than a minute to make up my mind, but after movement 19, i replied with two quick movements trying to put some pressure on black. and there we go. now that i have finished the game, i´d give this a"?" or maybe a "?!", since there is an important thing: c8 is a white square, controlled by bb, and therefore, difficult to be a place where my pawn can become something bigger. but it is still interesting. now is a brutal race, and black makes the exact (from my point of view) movements needed to beat white. seems unique (or as good as) to me, allowing the advance on c. not only bringing the n to the attack, but also forces wn to be traded, and therefore the support it was giving to r in c1 is gone. i was expecting gxf, and then black has a column opened on w castling. but this seems to be good as well, allowing bb in g7 to help with the attack. had i have my ne2, i would have thought of cxd, but now, this seems to be my only possibility to make progress. i had a good feeling though, since bb in d7 starts loosing squares, but that is only a mirage. i might have even helped my opponent with his attack. now, not sure what to do. i was thinking on qf1 (allowing r in b3 to defend f3) but thought that that would be a hanging man (woman) considering the threat of r in f8. so i aimed for the idea of supporting a4 advance, considering my only possibility of victory. i miscalculated the threats black has, even when i knew f3 advance would create havoc on my files. i even foresaw qg4+ and though i could cover with wb in g3 on time, but , again, another threat comes into play: bd4+. all this is a little ahead of us, but i wanted to show how many problems white is facing now. a must i think (i thought). i may be wrong, but g3 leads to mate, and waiting for fxg2 cannot be much more helpful. this is what i was talking about. and then i saw the mentioned 27...bd4+. so i had to displace my king. at this point, i already had the feeling i had lost, either slowly (...qg2+ or and bxe4, etc) ) or faster, as it did happen in the game. nice ending! the faster approach trying to add some confusion... but black doesn´t fall for it (i am talking about making a wrong move, like " a clear mate" qe2+??) game over. very nice game, i enjoyed it a lot! 
-------------------------------------
weak response against sicilian, but liked to try something different. that is the fun on a blitz game! (although the movement is not very active...hence not much fun for white it announces) 3.nc3 seemed the adequate defense to prevent d5. strong pawn in d4. but 4...dxe5 seemed more interesting. yes, the fianchetto now is open, but it takes too many times for white to develop to safety. helping in f5 when opening there closing the center. very strong for black, that has plenty of room to develop. seems to be following regular development rules, but i think black has to have in mind f5 and hence, maybe 6...bd6: 7...ne7 with the possibility of f6 seemed more interesting. not sure of this quick analysis though. trying to secure the center somehow. black doesn´t want to lose the pawn in d4, so i was just trying to set a defense for the incoming attack on the queenside. maybe an unnecessary and risky movement, since white needs and wants to focus on the kingside, the only area where it can develop some trouble for black. a just movement. no need to look for a quick castling yet, i think. avoiding ng4 and also setting the prelude for the ultimate advance on the bk (after castling) white has a poor development on his left flank and it will take time for those nb1 and bc1 to do something else that stay and watch, but on the other hand, the rest of the pieces are ready to collaborate for the assault on the bk side. not sure of black needed to do this, although it seems perfectly normal. the pawn advance on the castling now seems too strong and dangerous. and yet, white doesn´t seem to have enough firepower to support the assault. a very straight movement. the plan is very clear, but the tactic to make it successful is not so easy to find. maybe the worst mistake for black´s in the whole game. weakening the defense was not only unnecessary, but risky and may be giving white the chance to complete the assault. now then, how to proceed. trying to mate in g7 seems to be ineffective here. but maybe in wq can move to h6 and from there hold black pieces while advancing pawn in h and supported by the rook, the victory seems feasible. allowing hte rook to defend g7 while bring back to defense bb by placing it on f8. not sure what to do and thought that n in c6 was a pain in case of nb4, which would tie my n in a3. instead , i want that n released and joining the attack. it may be a waste of time, but couldn´t find out how else to proceed now (not enough time for the plan of qh6, pawn in ha advance supported by rook mentioned before) it defends h3 and at the same time helps me making a decision. now that i see it, maybe qg3 was more effective, for the plan would be then kf2 and then rh1. in case of black trying h5, i was thinking about ng3 and then sac in h5 to enter then with the queen. bringing in more firepower. now different sacs are possible thanks to this little jumper. black seems to be in a sort of zuzgwang. has to try a counter attack on queen side no trouble here for white as far as keeps calm rook is released from service, since bf8 seems to cover the situation nicely. this is a bluff, but at the same time, after nh6 there is a threat in f7 (covered easily by black, hence the bluff) black should not take on g4, since it will open that column for the rook to assist. but it does (hoping to find 23.qxg4?  ?) the plan is very clear, as mentioned before. that sacrifice seem to be the only defense for black; even losing one pawn seem to be alright in such a tight situation. but there is a surprise against that idea. white doesn´t need to take the pawn! and here we go. it is mate in 4! great ending for an interesting game. 
-------------------------------------
mmhh... i started to think that my opponent was a either newbie or wants to make a fool out of me. the feeling grows stronger. i decided to continue because i have seen real good players "making experiments" in these blitz games. anything for the fun, and i myself do try some unorthodox movements as well so i decided to go for a french-like defense, taking advantage of the poor development white is doing. not common to accept on c5, it opens that flank for black to attack and also releases the bbishop freely attacks the bishop and creates a point of positioning his own wb very actively. but white still is hampered by his poor development. sort of forced. you can feel some preassure now on the bk castling, and i started to feel uneasy here. but still, black seems to be positioning his pieces nicely. still seems that e3 is more important, but nbd2 is also ok, since supports a future c4 or even e4. maybe not needed now, but i didn´t like the perspective to lose that diagonal in case more pressure comes to my bb in b6. now the mentioned c4 seems to be interesting. even prepared with rc1. black has his chances on the queen´s flank, since it has an open "c" column, but white doesn´t seem to be that bad: no clear threats on the king´s side, yet. finishing development. middle game now projects a confrontation on the queen flank, but i also  kept in mind that blacks bishops are aiming for the wb future castling. so with that mentioned idea of trying something on the king´s side, i made the mistake to open too soon (didn´t see i was losing a pawn here, i must say). e5 was an interesting move after re8 is played. but the moment i did the move i begun to think of possibilities to attack the center, since wk is still in his initial position. better taking with the n instead of the powerful bishop it seems...  white has not let me get away with this, so it is not that naive as the opening reflects. but now look. if wb retires to c3 or back to b2, black can try to block the bishops with d4 (countered by e4, thus blocking b in d3) and then try to exploit the situation moving the rook to e6 and b in b6 to d7. too many moves, i know, but an interesting plan anyways. so white decided to exchange it for the n, that could support the attack on the castling, although at the same time, removes a piece that would interfere with a potential rook activity on 6 line.  bg3 seemed to be a conservative but good idea. now the picture seems to be more than good for black, even with one pawn down. check the potential sacrifice on h3 thanks to that initial pawn movement there. it will hurt white a lot. bq doesn´t seem to be more active in a different square, so no need to remove it to allow the rook play on the 6th line, as planned before. true that rook will not be as safe as in the 6th, but white cannot cover both g5 and h5 with n and b. bb sacrifice on h3 is pending but much more clear and menacing now. a logical defensive movement. the idea seems to be bringing n to h2 and then position the b in e2. now, this is a grave but unclear mistake. i had thought of this while playing, and that´s why i did rh5. but i didn´t see a more interesting defense for white: a direct 16.nh2. queen threats r in h5 and at the same time n can position in a place that will not interrupt b in e2 (if decided to go there). black doesn´t have time to prepare bc7 and queen on mate position this way. still black has a promising attack in case of 16.nh2, but, after a light analysis, not that clear. maybe 16...rg5 can counteract nh2, but nothing straight comes from that to me. preparing the final assault as mentioned. now threatening qd6 or bxh3. now the n in f3 is pinned. 18.qf4 seems to be a must here. with the idea of ...qg6 if not taken. facilitating the threat. i case of gxh3 i´d say rxh3 solves the game, threatening both qg6+ and rxf3 and mate in h2. didn´t see this, i must confess. but when you have your pieces in position, you have plenty of solutions to come out with. victory is ours! a nice ending for a nice game. what started to seem like a boring game, ended up with an interesting position, and since i consider my rival did not do so bad in the middle game, when you have developmental problems at home, you don´t have too many options to come back. an instructive game to show the importance to finish your development properly (unless you have a good reason to do "odd" movements. 
-------------------------------------
a king indian defense... i like play be2-bg5 (averbach), but it`s a style choice. defensa india de rey, me gusta jugar ae2-ag5 (averbach), pero es una cuestión de estilo. if 6 ... e5 7 dxe5 dxe5 8 qxd8 rxd8 9 nd5 with adventage. another move is c5, but i do not doubt what nbd7 is most flexible. otro movimiento es c5, pero no dudo que el realizado es más flexible.  now, 7 ... c5 8 d5 qa5 is an alternative. a surprise, i wait 8 ... a5 with idea nc5 and, if white makes a long-castle, open the c-column with c6. una sorpresa para mí, esperaba a5, con idea de cc5, y si enrocaba en largo, que me abra la columna c con c6.  first this move, when the bishop and the rook pressures h5. if f3 or nf3, i need play g4 in the first move and castle in the second. primero este movimiento, presionando con el alfil y la torre a h5, si bloqueaba con f3 o cf3, es necesario jugar g4, en el primer caso, o enrocarse largo, en el segundo. close the h-column but black offer a point of attack inamovible. the new plan is f3-g4, opening the kingside. blacks need attack in the another side, because the center is closed. cerrando la columna g, pero ofreciendo un punto fijo de ataque. el nuevo plan es f3-g4, abriendo el flanco rey. las negras necesitan atacar el otro flanco, ya que el centro esta cerrado. losting time, my knigth in c3 isn`t playing in the attack. now, the bishop is out of the game for several movesperdiendo tiempos, mi caballo en c3 no está participando del ataque, ahora el alfil quedará fuera de juego por algún tiempo. most pressure about g4 and free the h column.. i think what this move it`s a blunder, the idea bd7 and c6 pressure in the c-column, with rc8,  and allows a b5 pawn, open the queenside with counterstrike. but the white control in the kingside is too dangerous. pienso que este movimiento es un error, la idea de ad7 seguido de c6, presionando con tc8 la columna c y amenazando b5, permite un juego en el ala dama con cierto contraataque, pero el ataque en el flanco rey de las negras es muy peligroso. allows the castle, and the another rook enter in the game, but this move puts my pawns in ligth squares and difficult the endgame. it`s a weak move, best are 15 bxf6 bxf6 16 gxh5. permite el enroque, entrando la otra torre em juego, pero coloca a mis peones en casillas blancas, dificultando el final. es un movimiento débil, mejor era 15 axf6 axf6 16 gxh5. great move, i wait bd7, now prottects g6. buen movimiento, esperaba ad7, ahora protege g6. now, 17 ... qb4 18 qxb4 cxb4, blacks is down a pawn, but the endgame is very hard for playing and, if black controls and put a piece in f4, probably this game is draw. only dream with rac8 controls c5 and the dark-square bishop no opposite, i have not a plan to attack. ahora, si 17 ... db4 18 dxb4 cxb4, las negras tienen un peón de menos, pero el final es muy difícil de jugar y si las negras consiguen dominar y ocupar f4, probablemente sea tablas. solo con imaginar que tac8, presionando c5 y el alfil de casillas oscuras sin oposición, no me permite encontrar un plan de ataque. black equals the material, but open the h-column, what were a blunder. here, i was too optimist and gives the knight in f2 to make a mate attack. las negras recuperan el material, pero abren la columna h. acá me sentí muy optimista y entregué el caballo en f2 para realizar un ataque de mate.  i do not see that, great move, returning the piece. no lo ví, un gran movimiento, devolviendo la pieza. good move, blocking the bishop in e2 and giving f8-square to the king. now, i feel what my adventage is no more. but the h-column gives me a invader plan. now, i think what black must go with the king to the queenside, but black try to defend your king in g8. buena jugada, bloqueando al alfil en e2 y cediendo la casilla f8 al rey. ahora, sentía que las blancas habian perdido su ventaja, pero remirando la posición, la columna h me cedía un plan de invasión. creo que las negras debían huir con su rey hacia el flanco dama, pero las negras intentaron defender su rey en g8. kf8-e7. threating qh7. good too. if 25.. bd7, to not allows rh3, 26 rxg6 open the position. buena movida, si 25 ... ad7, evitando th3, 26 txg6, abriendo la posición.  
-------------------------------------
defensa nimzoindia, variante samisch, las blancas quieren la pareja de alfiles y no les molesta que se les doblen los peones en la columna c. colocando mis peones en casillas oscuras. putting my pawn in dark squares, un error, claramente convenía d6 y de7, para jugar e5. a mistake, better is d6-qe7 with idea e5. las blancas están mejor, presionan la posición negra con los alfiles y amenazan abrir el centro con dc2-cd2-e4, donde lograrían un fuerte ataque. white has adventage, putting pressure in black´s position with both bishop and threat open the center with qc2-nd2-e4. atacando el debilitado flanco dama blanco, y por rayos x a la dama. ataccking the weak queenside and the queen. no es necesario, la torre podría apoyar un futuro avance del peón f. not necessary, the rook may be support f-pawn advance block e4. realizado con un tiempo de menos, esta jugada no surge tanto efecto. aunque me sentí perdido, luego encontré la próxima jugada, tomando la iniciativa. with a lesstime, this move isn´t effect. i was felling lost, but later i find the nex move. i take the iniciative las blancas necesitan invertir tiempo en recobrar el peón, dejando las torres descolocadas, tiempo que aprovecho para doblar las torres en la columna c y colocar el alfil en d5, ejerciendo un bloqueo sobre el peón pasado; los peones a y b son candidatos a peon pasado y deberán ser neutralizado. las blancas tienen problemas de coordinación. white needs moves to gain the pawn, and the rook will be in a3, a bad position. this time is approach to double rooks in c-column and put in d5 the bishop, blocking the past pawn un nuevo tiempo ganado. a new time nueva fase del plan, movilizar el flanco rey, a fin de reducir el contrajuego blanco. new phase, to movilize the kingside, to reduce the counterstrike. buen movimiento, se tiende una celada y de paso, se amenaza b5, creando un peón pasado móvil. las blancas deben presionar el peón ahora débil de b6. good move, this give a threat and try b5. complementario, no hay jauqes en la 6 fila. complementary, no checks in 6-rank. ahora, las blancas pierden pieza. now, white lost a piece. this pawn will be promotionated or changed for the rook. white resign 
-------------------------------------
najdorf variant a sharp continuation also qd3 or nb3. also rb1, but my idea is attack for the d-column and not for b a book move, white will attack for the semi-open g column with rf3-g3. with threat f5-rg3-qh6 book move, too a novelty, if f5, kh8. now, i am playing out of database defend the 3-rank and attack ths kingside nxb3 is better. this move gives me a tempo. black need counterattack the center in a flank-attack. with nxb3, black can move qc5. overlooked the sacrifice now white it´s a piece up. threat c-knitgh and attack the c1-defender best, in fritz program, it´s bxf7... but... i only think in defend the c1-square the last blunder, now i have a mate continuation  
-------------------------------------
enter in a benoni defense if white advance the d pawn. or english opening if g3 i am allowed a sicilian variant. i am feeling happy for practice this defense lost a tempo. be3 is an alternative the pawn´s chain is not definite, i think what be2 and o-o is better 10 ... a5 is alternative, but i prefered the development i do not like this move... tc1-be2-be3-b4- o-o with idea c5, a slow plan but solid. attack h7 by x-rays, the next move prevent this attack, but now offers a posibillity h3 and g4-g5, open the g-column attack the pawn, but a bad move. the knigt is outside  a tempo what was wasted in the move 11. d5 it´s the threat. but 16  b4 nc6 and the white is better  bad move... lost a pawn and opening the e-column with the white king in her attack h4 and f2. if 21 bg3 rxc1+ 22 qxc1 nc4 with total control of position better 22 kf1 bxh4. a threat if 24... rxe7 mate attack with rc8+ opening the column if 26 bxe3 rxe3 27 fxe3 qxe3+ 28 kd1 nc4 with threats in d2 and 29 rxc4 qd3+ nb3 a blunder... my opponent show the nails i want advance the b-pawn and i need protect my queen about the threats. however, i close the e column. if 41 ra1/d2 b2 if 42 ... kg8 43 rd8+ better what b1=q rxb1  
-------------------------------------
an error, better is nxe5. it´s a weak move yes... my opponent attack e5 by fianchetto. i wished qxd1, and, later rc2 with bd3. i think what c5 is better, and rc7. however, black is better and winning the pawn e5. nd7. protecting nd2, but i am lost. ???... nd7 yes... i now have tha pair of bishops, white are better. my rival concedded me double pawn in c column i think what this is a good move, gain space and restring he black knigth. winning move, the white king will pass to the black forthress

la defensa tarrasch frente al gambito de dama, particularmente no me gusta, pero obviamente es muy jugable. creo que es la mejor opción, apresurarse a dejar un peón pasado o retrasado en d5; para luego socavarlo con cc3-ag2 este avance deja el peón retrasado en d5, por lo tanto débil, pero a su vez, genera un candidato a peón pasado en la columna c, si se logra avanzar el peón b. este plan es muy lento, a mi juicio. interesante jugada, evita ag5, aquí busqué la posición en las bases de datos y me dí cuenta que está posición era típica. las siguientes jugadas, hasta la 13 de las blancas, son repetición de una partida de adorjan. la partida mencionada siguió df7, quitándola de los fuegos del fianchetto. la jugada realizada permite una simplificación que valué favorable a las blancas dado el peón pasado en d4. jugada que pierde material, quedo con dos piezas menores a cambio de una torre; además de la ventaja posicional por el peón pasado apoyado y de que la mayoría de peones está transitoriamente detenida. tomé de rey para jugar tc1 sin pérdida de tiempo, pero a la computadora le agrada más txf1 seguido de rf3. creo que la jugada realizada es más lógica. creo que mejor era b5 o a5 seguido de b5, para iniciar un ataque de peones en el flanco dama. la próxima jugada retrasa un ataque que mi oponente, quitando atractivo a la partida, jamás inició. preferí ir por g2 a ir por e2 por si necesitaba ocupar la columna e con la torre de urgencia. iniciando juego en el flanco contrario. más consecuente con la jugada anterior, era inmediatamente h5. camino a c3, dominando mejor el centro y bloqueando c4. mejor b6 primero, ahora restrinjo el flanco dama. mejor, me parece, h5. me parece importante este jaque intermedio, así permito la entrada de la torre en e5. la importancia de esta jugada, además de controlar la casilla de coronación del peón pasado, es sin dudas la amenaza d6-d7 de jugar mi oponente te8, ocupando la columna abierta. entrega un peón que no quise aceptar, no quería darle juego a las torres, aunque sin dudas, la aceptación debía ser lo mejor. cerrando las columnas, y quedándome con la casillas e3 f4 g5 para ingresar con el rey en el territorio ajeno. la pc marca como mejor plan ce2, pero me parecía que el caballo estaba bien ubicado en c3, y que la entrada del mismo debía ser a4. aquí puedo jugar te8, con amenazas en la retaguardia, sin embargo, prefiero seguir con las jugadas de rey. si tc8, yo hubiese jugado te7, amenazando tg7+. mejor que tg8+ penetración definitiva, según fritz, las blancas poseen una ventaja mayor a 6 puntos. la amenaza es th6 seguido de th8++. única. es un error, pero a tf7+ sigue af6, controlando d8. y el rey blanco apoya tranquilamente el avance del peón d.  
-------------------------------------
partida por el mini-torneo de bodejax. una partida que me resultó muy complicada de entender en todo momento, no obtuve ningún plan efectivo hasta ya consumado buena parte del mediojuego. seguí un libro de aperturas hasta la jugada 12. acepto cualquier recomendación sobre la misma. defensa siciliana, movilizando primero el flanco dama sobre el centro. la alternativa principal, preparando un eventual d4. la única variante que elijo. 2 cc6 y 2 e6 son las alternativas principales, pero no las únicas (2 g6, 2 cf6, 2 a6) ataque rossollimo, interesante para limitar la movilidad del negro en el flanco dama, pero a su vez, el alfil de casillas blancas es una pieza importante para el blanco. 3... cc6 permite llegar a las blancas a una estructura similar a una apertura española y 3 ... cd7 permite e5.  no forzado, pero consecuente con la jugada anterior. otras alternativas son 4 cc3, que pierde un tiempo, 4 de2 o 4 a4 más flexible que tomar de caballo. consolidación de d5, con una conformación tipo maroczy, a primera vista más favorable a las blancas que en variantes como paulsen, por el cambio del alfil rey, pero solo a primera vista. el peón en c5 traba la movilidad del centro y del flanco dama blanco, a diferencia de las estructuras tradicionales.  la variante 5... dg4 gana un peón, pero permite un desarrollo cómodo de las blancas, lo cual es sinónimo de peligro. presionando el agujero momentáneo de d5. común desarrollo, ahora del flanco rey.  alfil por fianchetto para responder tranquilo a d4 y preparando el enroque tranquilo. un plan de las blancas muy factible es el avance de peón f y hay que prestarle atención. golpe oportuno, que cede a las blancas varios flexibles planes. preparar el avance en el flanco dama con tb1, a3, b4, quizás con ae3 o ad2, o sobre el flanco rey, como ya se ha mencionado. a las negras solo les queda limitarse a esperar la decisión de las blancas y actuar en respuesta. jugada típica en la siciliana, el peón en c4 queda expuesto al ataque de la torre en un futuro, pero la casilla d4 es accesible a una pieza y con ello un dominio central. jugada flexible, quitando al caballo de los rayos x del alfil, sin mostrar los planes de antemano consolidación del peón central, evitando un molesto cg4 como respuesta a ae3.  es de esperar un ataque en el flanco dama ahora. movida profiláctica frente al avance en el flanco dama, para colocar una torre en b8 y la otra en b8, junto con b5, deteniendo el avance en ese flanco.  creo que es un error posicional, ahora las negras detienen tranquilamente el avance en ese flanco. al no poder jugar b4 ahora, la casilla c5 queda accesible al caballo de f6, claro que hay que quitar escombros previniendo cd5, antes de movilizar el caballo en f6, claro que ahora queda débil el peón en d6. evita el plan negro, pero el alfil es pieza valiosa teniendo los peones centrales en color distinto a dicha pieza.  la amenaza db6+ y dxb2 era inocua. pero un posible jaque en otro momento puede desembarazar una posición compleja para el negro siguiendo con el plan. simple pero efectiva jugada para mejorar la actividad de las piezas. ¿preparando b4 de todos modos? un poco lento, claro. ahora, a 16 b4 cce5. consolidando c4. incentivando b4. no comprendí esta jugada, probablemente mejor era dd2 o dc1. jugada sin primer sentido, luego del error blanco de la jugada 22 cae como la espada de damocles. otra jugada sin sentido. ambos jugadores perdemos el hilo posicional ¿permitir el próximo dominio de la casilla d3? hermosa sensación de colocar un caballo en tal posición, pero quizás fuese mejor retrasar dicho movimiento y solamente mantener la presión. claramente el caballo en d3 molesta, jugada que muestra que 20 ccd3 fue pérdida de tiempo, ya que cambiarlo por el caballo en c1 es una aberración posicional. error claro, la casilla d8 era fielmente controlada. esto parece fuerte, preparando d5, que ilusiona por la toma de iniciativa. pero mejor resultaba dc7, doblando las torres en la columna d. las blancas se sienten sin espacio e intentan cambiar. a las negras, dudo que les convengan los cambios, mejor mantener la presión. evitando cambios y presionando en d4-b4, más no resulta simple ver como evaluar la posición, ya que ambos bandos luego de tantos errores no tienen un plan definido pérdida de tiempo. td1 permitía presionar d6 de manera efectiva, aprovechando el error de la jugada 22. por fin, tomando actividad en la columna central. ¿por qué no td1 (cualesquiera)? jugada extraña, vigilando el peón débil en d6. quizás mejor, con esa idea, era jugar ah4 y luego de f6, si ag3.  creo no exagerar si digo que las negras ahora tienen ventaja. permite reforzar la casilla d5 sin pérdida de tiempos.  un alivio poder jugar esto. las negras tienen una ligera presión en el centro y piezas menores más activas. pero el final resultante de los próximos cambios no es fácil de conducir. liberándose de la presión ya cuando en la primer jugada del final se comete un error así, difícil sentirse seguro de enderezar el rumbo. te8 era una opción, y si se movilizaba el caballo en d2, te3 atacando g3 y b3.  he aquí para corregir el anterior error. a 36 ... tc2 37 ae1 tomando la iniciativa por amenazas contra el rey negro ahora el final está igualado creo que la mejor toma era de caballo. y que esta jugada es un error que permite tomar de nuevo la iniciativa a las negras.  claramente. el caballo no tiene buenas casillas donde colocarse (cg3 h4) logrando una mayor actividad de la torre. tb2 resultaba muy pasiva, ciertamente. pero quizás era la mejor opción. ganando como mínimo un peón, ahora. claro error de cálculo final ganado sencillamente. no es una buena casilla para el rey, mejor quizás rf3. jugué esto para evitar cambios de peones, ya que favorecen al bando débil. pierde un peón si 50 rg3 ce3 51 rf2 cf5, asegurando el peón pasado ahora ya no es necesaria la ayuda del caballo. blancas rinden.  
-------------------------------------
known as the bonch–osmolovsky defence, used by bluvshtein to defeat short in 2007. surprising for a move in the kg, 3... ne7 has hardly had a past, but interest has been growing in it. the idea is to meet 4.d4 with 4...d5 similar to the modern variation. d5 is protected, and black concentrates on the struggle in the center - avoiding weakening pawn moves to hold on to the extra pawn. white still maintains the initiative. centralising the knight and protecting the extra pawn. white wisely looks to keep the king safe and develop. further protects the knight to free up the queen and blocks the e-file to the king. bishop takes wouldn't have gained anything - the queen is safe to come out and then duck behind to defend the extra pawn. white's gained the fair share of the center, threatening d5. i figured this was the way to get a grip on d5... but i was wrong. i'm open to any ideas here. a mistake - allowing nb5 with multiple threats. better was bc4 first and then to take to allow a quick castling to take the sting out of how the game continues. a great move by my opponent, threatening forks on c7 and d6. it took me quite a few minutes to find a way out without losing a rook, but at the cost of a fool knight. this way, both c7 and d6 are guarded from the knight. offering to trade down the queens. and white has regained one pawn, and scrambled black somewhat with the isolated pawn and knight on the rim. also possible was 15.re1 be3 16.bxe3 fxe3. finally a break to castle. another nice move, taking b4 from the knight and giving him nowhere to go. i wasn't too sure what to play here, so figured i may as well look to grab the semi-open c-file. i wasn't sure whether the other rook should be on the e-file or d-file. trading would have just helped him bring the queen out and connect the rooks. i felt e4 was a nicely active square for the queen where she couldn't easily be dislodged (for example if re1 then qxf4) without perhaps a trade (and the trade of knight for bishop now works better for black). looking to exchange off the bishop or perhaps reroute through d2 to kick the queen. willing to trade the bishop and gain a post for the knight or perhaps regroup the center with the c-pawn. white has now connected the rooks, and black will contest the e-file. necessary to continue to protect the weak pawn (the slight advantage black has). i decided that the d-file was a better file for the rook - to better support the isolani and free the queen. looking back, i believe 16...rad8 was better. his rf3 move suddenly became clearer - to build a threat at g7. there are no alternatives i can see - g6 would have critically weakened the dark squares with a dark-squared bishop and queen on the board, bd6 just hangs the bishop or mate. and this i think is where white loses the game - looking for the bishop sac to tear open the kingside. a very enterprising idea, but it just didn't have the necessary followup this time. the king is exposed at the cost of a bishop for a pawn. however, white's firepower can be drastically reduced through trading off. looking to trade queen's with a potential mating threat on b1. and here white resigned - the attack has fizzled with black up a bishop for a pawn. i feel the resignation may have been a bit premature but he was definitely disadvantaged.

-------------------------------------
never set a conditional move in a complex position... the london (or something like that), a scheme i love, that foresee (if allowed) strong kingside attack, queenside castling, c3 (instead of c4), and ne5, g4, h4... while the lsb is trapped for black.  this is a mistake, actually, since should black move qb6, white has problems defending b2.  my bishop never had the intention to go to b5. it will move the last, since i am looking for queenside castling. but this move sets the possibility of a queenside black pawn storm, so i play... this pawn isn't aware of the great task it will play on the game. without it, i would have been lost.  pursuing c3, the queenside safeguard. white's scheme is almost complete. normally, by pushing g and h pawns white has a good attack here. but it won't be so easy this time... normally, i delay this move until black plays the bishop, but since he is delaying it... black is playing very good, building pressure on the queenside, while my attack on the kingside is still far. i consider this move a loss of time. i have to push my pawns instead. this bishop will came out when it is a real danger for black. of course, white has to take care about qb6, since the normal defence, qc2, is now impossible due to nxd4. i decided that if i don't attack very quickly, black can get the game even... sad necessity.... i expected na5... but not everybody is aggressive like me... i am aggressive, no doubt... this move loses a central pawn for black. of course, i will lose the important c one. still, the natural c4 is met by qxd4, i didn't want it. the game is quickly developing into a "black attacks the queenside and white the kingside", one of those nice situations in which is very hard to see who would be quicker. i saw it, and decided to play the exchanges. i couldn't imagine how complex will turn out to be the situation in few moves... of course, the queenside castling will be impossible.  i would say this move is sort of "naive"... but i am not the one who plays the passive rb1.  still, i had the nice nc4, forcing the queen to a7 (or d8), maybe better for me. this was a conditional move i set before...  but later, i saw that the simple 16. nxf7 would have been enough to win here! do you agree? as expected. it seems to be a refutation, but... yes, his sad b8 knight is hanging.  and now i have the time to take back the knight, having destroyed his king's position. of course, my own king is naked, too... wait, this is not all. probably, the best move is be5, threatening his rook and defending the important d pawn. if rf8, bg7... but i didn't dare to leave the knight. it is a mistake, actually.   2 pawns is not a bad score. but my white bishop has not easy square to retire, and my d4 pawn is en prise. more than that, my king is exposed to the pieces that can go to the black diagonal. only my pawn in a4 keeps me to be really, really bad... the other choice for black was qxd4, that i feared, but i had rd1, or bb4 (but i o-o)...  with this move, black intends to accelerate the checks on the black diagonas.  still, when i looked at this position, i had the feeling that i will be winning.  after looking carefully at it, i realized it is in fact almost lost for white...  i had the good threat rc1 (bc7+ and then the discovered check that would have made me win material, but this is not true! look...   20.	rc1, 		bb4+ 21.	kf1, 		qxd4 22.	bc7+, 	ke7 23.	bxh7,		rb2 24.	bf4, 		bc6 25.	g5-g6, 	rb1+ 26.	rxb1, 	qxb1+ 27.	ke2, 		bxh1 28.	g6-g7, 	qe1+ 29.	kd3, 		rd8+ 30.	kc2, 		rd2+ 31.	kb3, 		qb1+ 32.	kc4, 		bd5+ 33.	qxd5, 	bxd5#  ...as an example only.  after carefully considering be5 and rc1, i saw the checks on my king would have been too dangerous for me... since my queen will be called in defence of my king, while my white square bishop is still hanging! i admit this situation was far too complicated to be fully analyzed. too many hidden threats... observe that my white h1 diagonal is wide open... wow! black taking d4 allows me to rd1, with more threats and a nice pin over the lsb. yeah, yeah... the good (for me) side of this move is that it opens the column where the black king is... but how to go on? black apparently cannot take the a4 pawn with the bishop, due to the pin to the queen. but he can hide with the rook, but for my bishop. so, the safer move would have been something like bc2... that looks ugly! i analyzed all the variants i could after bf7, and the only good move for black will be bc5. against this, i have g6! any other move for black leads to material loss... but i must play very carefully, since a single mistake will lead black to threat mate on the white diagonal... combinations fluorished by both sides, and it was really difficult to find a "sure" move! note that if my queen gets far from g4, black will mate me! maybe a blunder but...  another plan was re1, then ra-d1...  black adds pressure and mate threats... more and more interesting.  some variants i looked at:  23.	rxd7+, 	kc8 24.	bxe6, 	be7+ 25.	bg3, 		qxa1+ 26.	kg2, 		qf6 27.	re7+, 	kd8 28.	qd1+, 	ke7 29.	qd7+, 	kf8 30.	bd6+, 	qe7 31.	qe7#	  or: 23.	bxe6, 	bf6+ 24.	bg3, 		bd4 25.	qh4+, 	bf6 26.	rxd7+, 	qxd7 27.	qf6+, 	qe7 28.	qxh8+, 	qe8 29.	qe8+, 	ke8 30.	bxb3	  or: 23.	bxe6, 	kc8 24.	be5, 		bf6+ 25.	bg3, 		bxa1 26.	bxd7+, 	kd8 27.	bg4+, 	ke7 28.	rd7+, 	kf8 29.	qc5+, 	kg8 30.	be6+, 	qf7 31.	bxf7+, 	kg7 32.	qg5+, 	kf8 33.	bd6#	  and a big "etcetera".... :-) letting him play the discovered check! i analyzed different outomes, and i was really wondering where will the bishop go.  bf4+ is interesting (recovering the bishop, or losing it) be3+ is also interesting, trying to play bxf2, and even  bc1+ is interesting, since then black can take the a1 rook with the queen! ok, let's see:   choices for white are:  a) bg3 b) kf1 c) kh1 d) bg4 e) qg4  a) 24. bg3 looks good.   the first answer to  be considered is a1) 24. ..., bxe6. this is good for me because it follows:       25. rxd2+, and black has 3 moves:   1+) 25. ..., bd7, that is no good for black for      26. qe5, and black ends loosing the bishop 2++) 25. ..., kc8      26. qc5+, and i win, or 3+) 25. ..., ke7, that doesn't make me win inmediately, but i keep good tactic resources.   the second answer for black is 2+) 24. ..., rd3. white can play  25. qh4+, that seems to provide good tactics for white, even after 25. ..., bg5 26. qxg5, qxq 26. rxr, qg7 27. rxbd7+, qxr 28. bxq, kxb and white is up a piece.  or:  25. bc4, bg4,  26. qh4+ and white ends with more material.  black doesn't seem to have other answer, so bg3 is a good move here, providing equality at least, unless black fails somewhere.   b) 24. kf1 it mantains free the dsb.   if black takes the bishop 24. ..., bxe6,  25. rxd2+ black has several answers here, with more or less the same as in the previous analysis, but with two differences.  the first is that black has to cope with the threat be5, that pins the queen. the second is that blacks has the threat bc4+, ke1, qg1#.  if black covers the king with 24. ..., bd7, he loses his threat. whte doesn't have the chance 25. rxd7+, qxd7, 26. rd1 because of rd3. white can answer 27. qh4+, but black has two answers:  1+) 27. ..., ke8, that looses material after 28. re1+, kf7,  29. qf4+, kg6,  30. qe4+, kf7 31. qc4+, kf8 (kg6 looses after re6+) 32. qf4+, kg8 33. be4, where the black rook is trapped, even if black plays qh3+, 34. kg1.  2-) 27. ..., kc8 28. qc4+, qc6 29. qxr, kxb and material is even! (no use for black to play qh1+, 30. ke2, re8+, 31. kd2, qxr+, 32. kxq, 33. re8, 34. qxr+, kxq and white has a free bishop!)  after 27. qa5+, kc8, 28. rc1+, kxb, 29. qe4+, ka7, 30. qxr(h8), etc, material is even again.   so, 26. rxd7+ leads only to even result.  but white can play directly 27. be5, pinning the black queen. i cannot see any good move for black, but to loose a quality.  better is for black not to cover the king, and again we have 2 moves:   1-) 25. ..., kc8, that keeps the mate threat over white. white has to care about his rook on a1, too, so he must play 27. qc5+, kxb, and white has nothing, since 28. ra1-d1, leads to be mated starting with bh+.  no need to analyze kf8, since it is not difficult for black to find kc8.   so 25. rxd7+ doesn't seem to be a good way to progress for white.   now, what happens if white plays 25. qa5+ instead? nothing.  and what if white plays 25. qc4? black gets the hand with bh3+.  so no b) kf1.   c) 24. kh1 has the disadvantage of bc6+. my god, even 25. f3 seems to be possible. bxf3,  26. qxf3, rxf3, 27. rxd2+, if ke7,  28. rd7+, and it is better for black to play kxb, that leads to equality (29. rxq, rxb) than  kf6 (29. rxq, kxr, 30. be5+, rf6, 31. rg1+, winning the rook).  but let's see 25. bd5. it's hard to find a my saving board... i cannot take the rook, and i cannot take the bishop... funny, isn't it? freeing himself from the potential pin/check.  note that be5 is not possible for me anymore, because of bxb+. but still so, f3 (bxf3, qxb, rxq, bxq is to be considered. was it really necessary for black? if f2xg3, with qh6 black releases his position.  the spectre of this move stayed over me all the time.  norhing better. it seems that black has coped with the storm and the game will be decided in the endgame.  relax? not yet. the tension is partially released. i couldn't make much of all the hard work... i decided i won't succeed in threating the bishop.  releasing queen's threat over a1. note i am only a careless move from mate. despite my material advantage. after all. black cannot take a4 because of qa6+ and wins.  foreseen.  the white queen guards g2. we are in a kind of stalled position, with mate threats on both sides. but now black loses a pawn.  and black cannot take the a4 pawn due to qe5+, while qe4+ is saved by qf3. at last, the endgame.  definitely ending with the tactic moment. i am a quality and a pawn up, with 2 passed and joined pawns. a win.  another possibility was rd3, but this just allowed c5 with a slight uneasiness for black.  just in case. the game is not finished yet. tempting black to try tricks based on his bishop and the position of my king... ...which he does. black is trying a checkmate, so he is not trying to recover the quality by pushing his pawn... but i know he must hold his pieces. i thoght about a5, but this will make my pawn vulnerable to his bishop and rook... anyway.  trusting on f5 as the escape square of my king. i am not very trained into finals, so i thought that the nearer to the 8º row my pawns, more chances i had to finish the game soon.  ...but maybe i should have prevented his king to cross this line. now i have to start thinking again... uff!!!! ;-))) when faced with this, i thought that my rook can either escape to f7 or be supported by the other one. but i thought this will have granted him a draw, after rh2+, kg3, rg2+, kh4 (trying to reach the safe square h6), rh2+, kg5, bf4+. of course, i had rh3, but i didn't see it.  you see, after all the thinking, i was really tired of this game, and with almost no time to think about it.  as usual in this kind of position, sacrifying the quality is a sure way to win. so i played... ...thinking that if c4, ra3, c3, rxc3, bxr, rxb and nothing will stop my pawns! by this move, i had accepted that my move rh3 would have protected me against any trick involving trapping my king.  probably a definitive mistake, since it gives me the necessary tempo to bring my rook to f7 safely.  you see, re3+ make him lose. rxr+, kxr, rxb and nobody can prevent my rook to take the c pawn then crown mine.  47.	f3-f7, 	g7-e5 48.	f7-e7, 	e2-h2+ 49.	h3-g4	, h2-g2+ 50.	g4-h4	, g2-h2+ 51.	b3-h3	, h2-h3+ 52.	h4-h3	, e4-f5 53.	e7-e5+, 	f5-f6 54.	e5-c5	, f6-g7 55.	h3-g4	, g7-h6 56.	c5-c7	, a6-a5 57.	c7-h7#	  7.	f3-f7, 	g7-e5 48.	f7-e7, 	e2-h2+ 49.	h3-g4	, h2-g2+ 50.	g4-h4	, g2-h2+ 51.	h4-g4	, c5-c4 52.	e7-e5+, 	e4-e5 53.	b3-c3	, e5-d4 54.	g6-g7	, h2-g2+ 55.	c3-g3	, c4-c3 56.	g7-g8	, c3-c2 57.	g3-g2	, c2-c1 58.	g8-d8+, 	d4-e3 59.	g2-g3+, 	e3-e4 60.	d8-d3+, 	e4-e5 61.	g3-e3+, 	e5-f6 62.	d3-f5+, 	f6-g7 63.	e3-e7+, 	g7-g8 64.	f5-h7+, 	g8-f8 65.	h7-f7#	  47.	f3-f7, 	g7-e5 48.	f7-e7, 	e4-f5 49.	b3-f3+, 	f5-g5 50.	f3-g3+, 	e5-g3 51.	e7-e2	, g5-f6 52.	h3-g3	,  48.	f7-e7, 	e4-f5 49.	b3-f3+, 	f5-e4 50.	g6-g7	, e4-f3 51.	e7-e5	, e2-e5 52.	g7-g8, 	e5-h5#  48.	f7-e7, 	e4-f5 49.	e7-f7+, 	f5-g5 50.	b3-g3+, 	e5-g3 51.	g6-g7	, e2-e8 52.	f7-f8, 	g3-d6  but  48.	f7-e7, 	e4-f5 49.	b3-f3+, 	f5-e4 50.	g6-g7	, e4-f3 51.	e7-f7+, 	e5-f4 52.	f7-f4+, 	f3-f4 53.	g7-g8	, e2-e3+ 54.	h3-h2	, e3-e2+ 55.	h2-h1	, e2-e1+ 56.	h1-g2	, e1-e2+ 57.	g2-f1, 	e2-c2 58.	h5-h6	, f4-f3 59.	g8-f7+, 	f3-e3 60.	h6-h7	, c2-c1+ 61.	f1-g2, 	c1-c2+ 62.	g2-g3	   48.	f7-e7, 	e4-f5 49.	b3-f3+, 	f5-g5 50.	e7-e5+, 	e2-e5 51.	g6-g7	, g5-h6 52.	g7-g8	, e5-h5+ 53.	h3-g2	, h5-g5+ 54.	f3-g3, 	g5-g8 55.	g3-g8	 i was sadistic here, because he must have though he had some chanche, after all, but everything was under control... at last... and nothing can stop my pawn. uffffffff!!!!!!!!!!!!

-------------------------------------
  stopping white's f pawn seemed a priority. closes the center for now. rb8 seems better.  iod adds: "instead of 21...ra8 i would have played ...rb8, but there's nothing much in it. having played this one to a8, though, bringing the other rook to b8 (as you did eventually) ought to have been higher on the agenda, i feel. having begun the fight on the q-side, i think you needed to carry it through quickly. having said all that, you were still on around about an even footing until the 25th move." a waiting move? 23... bxa3? cm:  25.axb4 axb4 26.ra1 rba8 27.rxa6 rxa6 28.nc1 ra1 29.bg2 qe7 30.nb3 rxf1 31.bxf1. perhaps rab6.  ion: 25...b3?! probably this isn't all that bad, really, but it seems more in white's than black's interest that the q-side be closed in this way. 25...dxc3 and black still has a fine game. black's still ok for the moment , but... better was nxd4.  the opening of the c file would suit black fine.  the eventual opening and white domination of the center was very strong.  ion prefers cxd4: "26...c4? was the decisive mistake, and i rather think it was the previous move that led to it. though black hangs on by his teeth for quite a long time, there was really no cure against the huge pawn centre white now established. the right course here was the straightforward 26...cxd4, with a roughly even game." isolates black's pawn at d5. cm says, "slightly better is a4." now black's trouble begins.  because the queen is undefended both knight and bishop are safe for now. ion: "28...ne7 was a bit of an improvement over 28...rd8. after 28...rd8 29.qc3! threatening qxc4 was decisive. but it's really the difference between a large disadvantage and a lost game..." cm: leads to 29...ne7 30.rbd1 qc8 31.qe3 bg8 32.e6 kf8 33.qe5 qc5 34.d6 qxe5 35.fxe5 bxe6 36.dxe7  kxe7 37.rxd8 kxd8, which wins a queen, a rook, and a knight for a queen, a rook, and two pawns. better is qc3, leading to 29...na7 30.dxe6 qxe6 31.nd4 qb6 32.rbd1 ‡nb5 33.nxb5 rxd1 34.e6  kh6 35.rxd1 qxb5, which wins a rook, a bishop, and a knight for a rook, a knight, and a pawn. cm: "disengages the pin on white's pawn at d5 and moves it behind the passed pawn at d5."  despite what chessmaster says, the pin stands. wastes time.  black should instead pivot the knight to contest d6.  the bishop was safe for the moment. black running out of ideas doesn't like e6 , but be6 better prevents as the consequences of kh6 are very dangerous. black is out of ideas. prevents 34. e6 which loses the black queen as 34... qe7 35. g5  qxg5 36. fxg5  kxg5.  bishop is safe... despite that cm says:
-------------------------------------

-------------------------------------
just a reminder about the time control. it was 40 moves in 90 minutes, after that an extra 30 minutes is added if your time runs out. there is also an increment of 30 seconds per move. this was a surprise. my opponent - the number 5 seed in the tournament, and a fide master - the first i have ever played to my knowledge - has played the benko gambit. and this surprised him, as d4 player he was not expecting me to allow a transposition to a e4 opening. the pirc defence (correctly pronounced "peerts", but often mispronounced "perk"), sometimes known as the ufimtsev defence or yugoslav defence, is a chess opening characterised by black responding to 1.e4 with 1...d6 and 2...nf6, followed by ...g6 and ...bg7, while allowing white to establish an impressive-looking centre with pawns on d4 and e4. it is named after the slovenian grandmaster vasja pirc. the usual reply. slightly unusual - black normally plays g6 here. no point in going to c4 where it can be hit with b7-b5 black stakes a claim in the centre. and this is the usual reply i can't see this move on any of my databases, and i don't think it is very good! too many pawn moves! nb-d7, be7, g6, exd4, qc7 and qb6 have all been played here. the setup f2–f3, be3 and qd2 is commonly used against the king's indian defence and dragon sicilian, and can also be used against the pirc; indeed, this system is as old as the pirc itself. another strange pawn move. again, i think nb-d7, be7, g6, exd4, qc7 and qb6 are all better. maybe i should have continued with my plan of be3, but i almost felt duty bound to try and exploit his weakening of the g5 square and the fact he couldn't play h7-h6 any more. he at last develops. and i continue. maybe he was planning c6-c5. i exchanged as i was afraid of him exchanging on d4 followed by c6-c5-c4 he takes back. i decide to re-route my knight to e3 and i was thinking about strengthening my centre with c2-c3. he develops. heading for f5. he stops nf5. attacking before he catches up fully on development. he develops. i take. he takes back. and i castle. he can't play 14.....nxe4 immediately as i had 15. bxe4 bxg5 16. bxc6 so he protects c6, threatening nxe4! the plan is to follow up with qh4 at some stage, but it may be a losing mistake! 15. qa5 was called for, with equality. pinning the knight. unpinning the knight! ok stop and work out black's next move! a brilliant move, which i hadn't seen. black doesn't win any material, but gains the two bishops, most importantly he gains my good dark squared bishop, and he has more active pieces. i take. he takes back. the only safe square for the knight. he finally castles. i am not sure if the knight is any better places here. contesting the a file. uniting the rooks. with the threat of taking on a1 followed by taking on f2 - or indeed vice versa. an unusual self pin! black is in control. he masterly improves the position of his king before doing anything. i hit his bishop it retreats. i prevent him from doubling my pawns - although is that really a threat? he starts to double on the a file. i unpin my knight. he doubles his rooks. i exchange. he takes back. i can stop worrying about him taking on f2 now. i was rather expecting h5-h4 preventing ng3. protecting b2. attacking b2. i am hoping he would give up his strong bishop to gain a pawn here. instead he correctly plays this. i continue my plan. 29. qxb4 loses to qh4  he correctly keeps his good bishop. maybe nc1 was better? what do you think dear reader? he improves the position of his knight. preventing nc4. threatening mate on g1. which i have to stop. he takes. i take back. he finally wins this pawn. it is very instructive how he didn't hurry to win this pawn, and calmly improved the position of his pieces first. hoping for counter-play along the a file and/or trapping his rook on b2. the knight comes in. attacking his rook. knight check. i take. he takes back. this knight pops out. threat - c4 winning the bishop. creating room for my bishop. he hits it anyway.  it retreats. a second pawn drops. he is threatening to take my knight now. this is its only square. white resigns. i can't stop his b pawn from queening. many thanks for reading. please leave a comment or two and rate this annotation with the star system to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
this was played in the first round of the british over 50s chess championships in llandudno. although i was out-rated i managed to draw the game. i had looked up some of his games, and saw that he played the king's indian defence, and i rattled out the first moves very quickly. the king's indian is a hypermodern opening, where black deliberately allows white control of the centre with his pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it with the moves ...e5 or ...c5. until the mid-1930s, it was generally regarded as highly suspect, but the analysis and play of three strong soviet players in particular—alexander konstantinopolsky, isaac boleslavsky, and david bronstein—helped to make the defence much more respected and popular. it is a dynamic opening, exceptionally complex, and a favourite of former world champions garry kasparov, bobby fischer, and mikhail tal, with prominent grandmasters viktor korchnoi, miguel najdorf, efim geller, john nunn, svetozar gligorić, wolfgang uhlmann, and ilya smirin having also contributed much to the theory and practice of this opening. in the early 2000s the opening's popularity suffered after vladimir kramnik scored excellent results against it, so much so that even kasparov gave up the opening after relentless losses to kramnik. however, kramnik himself won a fine game on the black side of the kid in 2012, and current top players hikaru nakamura, teimour radjabov and ding liren all play the opening. this is sämisch variation, a subtle blockading system and a critical challenge to the king's indian.[1] it is named after the german grandmaster friedrich sämisch. the sämisch has been played by numerous grandmasters, including world champions mikhail botvinnik, mikhail tal, tigran petrosian, boris spassky, anatoly karpov and garry kasparov.  bobby fischer had trouble against the sämisch. mednis' how to beat bobby fischer showed that five of fischer's losses were against the sämisch king's indian, and remarked that fischer eventually avoided the king's indian if he believed he would face the sämisch.[2] fischer faced the sämisch five times against boris spassky in their 1992 rematch, however—winning two, drawing two and losing one.  in the encyclopaedia of chess openings (eco), the sämisch variation is covered in chapters e80 to e89  this is where i had to start thinking. up to now we had been following another game by mark page. in that one, black played 10.....b7-b5, white replied c4-c5 and the game was eventually drawn. 10.....nd7 prepares b7-b5 but prevents c4-c5. i have to play actively before he gets in this thrust. so that if he ever plays f5-f4, i will have a lovely e4 square for my knight.  of course not 11....rxf5?? 12. g4 winning a piece. one idea is to divert his f pawn away from protecting the e4 square, allowing me to play ne4. he takes. i take back. afterwards my opponent was critical of this move, as giving up a pawn for not enough compensation, but in my opening databases, this has always been played rather than the timid nf6. so i take. he takes back. and i take back. he commented afterwards he wasn't sure if this knight should go to c5 or e5. in my opening databases, it seems that the knight normally goes to e5. ok what would you play now? i thought that this was logical, protecting g4, but after the game my opponent correctly pointed out afterwards that 16. bh6! is much better exchanging his powerful dark squared bishop. if he plays 16.... bxg4 i simply exchange on g7 and then play 18. rg1! winning his bishop (if 18...h5 then 19. h3), and if he exchanges first i still have the killing pin on his bishop if he takes on g4. i had a long think here. i was looking at bg5, but eventually came to the conclusion that i was simply driving his queen to a better square and my bishop could be vulnerable on that square. plus on e3, the bishop could take on c5 in some variations.  which is why i retreated. preparing b7-b5. what would you play here dear reader? this is what i played, but it is a mistake. i should have played bd4, exchanging off his bg7. so he correctly sacrifices a pawn to open up lines on the queen side. so i take. he takes back. i finally develop this bishop. he takes. i take back. he hits my knight. i retreat, blocking the long dark diagonal. what would you play here for black? did you find it? i think black has the advantage now. what would you play as white? i played this, the only move. i offered a draw, i realised i had let black into the game, and he now had the advantage. what would you play here as black? played after a long thing. after the game he said he was also looking at 23....rxa2 and he showed me some interesting variations, in one he wins my queen for two rooks, but it is probably not winning for him. i think that simply 23....qxc2 is best followed 24....rxa2 and black has the advantage. i think white is ok now. regaining one of the pawns lost. forced! he takes back. i have to try and neutralise his rb2. and he wants to maintain a rook there. another good defensive move, although i say it myself. he avoids exchanges. forced! still attacking. 29. r(either) to e2 loses to 29....rb2+ attacking his rook. throws in a check. forced! another check. forced again. another check. with another draw offer. i thought he was going after a repetition. but declined. forced. he takes. i take back. finally getting his pawn back, but he has no advantage. afterwards he praised this move of mine. he takes. i take. he takes back. at last this rook is active. he pushes his past pawn. i attack. he counter attacks. i protect my pawn. he pins my knight. i break the pin. he takes. i take. he takes. i take. he checks. the surest way to draw. he takes. i take back. and drawn on black's suggestion. many thanks for reading, please rate this annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing with my annotations. until next time dear reader!

reminder of the time limit - 40 moves in 90 minutes, plus 30 minutes if your time runs out before then, plus 30 second increment. again i was late for the start, due to heavy traffic on the a55, i was about 10 minutes late. i hope to rattle out moves of a sicilian defence or a grünfeld defence, but it was not to be. i paused before playing... probably leading to a king's indian defence reversed i thought. ok maybe a queen's indian reversed i thought. so i played this. and then he comes up with this. i sank deep into thought. a reversed budapest defence! never met it before! i considered dxe4. now in the budapest defence, after 1.d4 nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 black can try the fajarowicz variation 3...ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but that line has rather been put out of fashion by 4. a3! which stops any tricks based in ....bf8-b4+. so i didn't really look at 3...dxe4 4. ne5, thinking that 4.....a6 would refute it, and spent most of my time looking at 3....dxe4 4. ng4, and all the complications of the budapest defence but with white having the extra move, which i decided to avoid. after the game my opponent showed me a trap, 3.... dxe4 4. ne5 qd4 5. bb2 qxb2 6. nc3 and the black queen is trapped, for instance 6.....qa3 7. bb5+ and 8. nc4. so after 3....dxe4 4. ne5 is the most common move, and 4....a6 is the best next move. however i led the game down a different route. by playing this, i hoped to keep the position closed. he instantly whipped out this move. i felt i wanted to conserve my good light squared bishop and i didn't want him doubling my pawns after 4...nc6 and him taking on c6 at some stage. he threatens to take my c pawn. so i hit his bishop. he takes. i take back this way, to give protection to d4. he takes. i take back. he attacks d4. unable to safely protect it again, i advance it. he comes in with this fork. i realise that i am going to lose my d pawn as qf3 is coming. i try this, hoping that he will take the d pawn and i will take on e4. but is plays this. i hit his knight. he takes. now he is a pawn up, and better development. it should be a winning advantage for white. my plan is to play e7-e5 and make his extra pawn on d2 backward on a semi-open file. he hits my queen. queen moves. knight comes in. i hit his knight. he hits my queen. i attack his rook, his knight is still hanging. after a long think, he realises that tactics based on nc7+ and/or bxf8 don't quite work. i am getting back into the game now. he takes back. i finally secure the centre, and his pawn on d2 is backward on a semi-open file. castles stopping his knight returning to d5 i thought. but he plays it anyway. this leads to the loss of a pawn and slight advantage to black. so i take. he takes back. i attack his pawn again. he advances. i protect b7. his knight protects d6. preparing to castle. i can win the d6 pawn either by nf7 at some stage or b7-b5 driving away his knight protecting it. black has at least equalised.  he decides to exchange my dominant queen. but my knight comes in. he takes, and offered a draw, which i declined. my knight is now dominant. perhaps planning f2-f4. i decide to round up the d6 pawn. his knight drops back. the pawn goes. he improves the position of his king. i prevent f2-f4, which would now be met by taking his f pawn en passant.  he contests the c file. i bock his entry squares on c8, c7 and c6. so he comes in here instead. i contest the c file. he takes. i take back. he throws in a check. i return to d7. he can't keep hold of this pawn without completely tying up his pieces. i hit his rook. rook moves. i take. he takes back. i take. he blocks the pawn with his knight. i tie down his queen-side pawns. his king comes across to help. he resigns. many thanks for reading this annotation, please rate it on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader!

sometimes it's the minor things that set up the attack. in this french defense mini-tournament game white uses a rather passive move (7.h3) to block black's attack against his dark square bishop. black later takes aim at exactly that square. let's see where this leads. last move of the initial position of the mini-tournament. white decides to go for the exchange. both parties make preparations for a kingside castle. waiting to see where white's dark square bishop goes before moving the king's knight. one of black's plans would be to eliminate the e3 bishop with ng4. this move is in response to that threat. however a direct 7.nf3 is better. the line 7.nf3 ng4 8.0-0 nxe3 9.re1 with recapture poses no problems for white. putting a knight in the center with 9...ne4 is probably better for black, but since he has a plan in mind... a short maneuver to target h3. ?; better is 11.qc2 for a simmilar battery. the whole point. white's best chance would be to count the pawn as a loss and concentrate elsewhere. this just opens up the kingside for black's pieces. nh-f3 is better but white still faces problems. going on with the plan. however a simpler win is available with the direct 13...re4. [fritz] not wanting to give white a chance to bring his f-rook into play. notice how passive white's rooks and queen are. how to continue now?  white guards lots of squares on the g and h files and it seems like a rook lift won't help. still... not helping with the situation, but then again, no move really could. !; making room for the other black rook. of course fritz insists that 17...rf6 is a better move. heh, what does he know? the natural continuation of the plan. a rook sacrifices itself for its sister's glory. nothing better since black threatens mate at h1. et voilà! what seemed impossible a couple of moves ago - getting a rook with check on the g-file - came to happen. 20.bxh7 would have prevented the onslaught for a while but it would only have pleased fritz. the point is black's. mate in 7. white foregoes the useless 21.bg6. the end. white's queen and queenside rook were literally out of the game, while the light square bishop - moved once in the opening - only moved again before the final accord.

my old start out. expected e6 but o well. move queen out for 2 possible moves: 4-move-checkmate or black g6 then take pond, check him, and take rook. black doesnt do what i was hoping for. allows development and protects e5. allows development and stops e5 pond from moving foward. takes knight and doubles the pond. a simple block but  think i would have been better moving my knight to c3 or d2. pressuring a5. somethings i froget what i was doing. queen side castle, although i think it would have been better to do king side castle because its more protected. forking bishop and knight, doubling my pawns and capturing the knight. i guess it wasnt such a brilliant idea. threatning rd1 forking the rook at h8 and bishop at g4.  i would have took the rook with my bishop but instead he messes up his king-side castling. allowing small development of rf8 but blocking off the queen. blocks check with queen but messing up all his castling as well. allows development... i think thats what i was doing... threatning c3. protects c3 aand the whole row. random thing. ¿¿¿¿¿  makes the game an even more of a closed game. pressuring the king. i would've moved it back into the 8th row.  he's just putting his king in more danger. allows development of the bishop to check him. i wonder why i didnt do it... it could mess up his pond defense system.... as you see... im not the most brilliant chess player. finally! i checked him. blocks with pond. forced to move to f6. that wasn't one of my better plays. finally! the other rook is now in play. another random thing? 4 rooks in play now. threatens my rook.... could've done something better. oldfasion way.  forced to move. and mate! a game of many random,stupid, and some smart stuff.

partita del centro ora siamo in una scozzese 4. c3 è il cosiddetto gambetto goering  e siamo rientrati in una classicissima italiana il nero ha gioco soddisfacente dopo 6. e5 d5! il seguito di gioacchino greco detto il calabrese, grande giocatore del 1600. 7.ad2 è il seguito abituale oggi.  il bianco non teme di sacrificare materiale! il nero non deve essere troppo avido. greco vinceva facilmente dopo 8... cxc3 9. bxc3 axc3 10. aa3 axa1 11. te1+  questa prosecuzione dell'attacco è stata ideata dal danese moeller. nella prima e terza partita del suo secondo match contro  lasker , steinitz ha giocato 9. bxc3 d5 10. aa3!?, ma nulla ha potuto contro il gioco preciso di lasker il nero ha giocato con prudenza e precisione, accontentandosi di un pedone.  ora però deve stare attento per non concedere chances al suo avversario. se 11... o-o 12. d6 cxd6 13. ag5 con compenso per il materiale sacrificato  il bianco attacca alla baionetta. il seguito più usuale è 12. ag5 evidentemente il nero non si fidava a giocare 12... o-o, che peraltro sembra sostenibile  una volta che hai detto a, devi pure dire b (vecchio proverbio russo)   il bianco punta tutto sull'attacco  blocca l'avanzata dei pedoni bianchi e offre la casa g7 al re probabilmente era migliore  15. ad2 e se 15... axb2 16. tb1 ag7 17. cd4 con compenso per il materiale sacrificato  il bianco esagera. buona o cattiva che fosse, bisognava giocare 16.dxc6 ecco il momento critico! il nero pensa che la minaccia di spinta in d5 sia in grado di tarpare le ali del bianco. l'idea in sé non è illogica ma si rivelerà perdente.  alcuni commentatori dell'epoca hanno suggerito 17... cb6 ma dopo 18. tae1 il bianco ha un forte attacco. la mossa che smonta l'attacco è invece 17... ae5!  il bianco ha completato lo sviluppo ed è pronto a colpire le alternative dimostrano quanto il nero è sotto pressione il bianco minaccia anche cxc6! a) 18... ad7 19. aa5!

-------------------------------------
!! una sorpresa de impresión. ya que alin nunca ha jugado la defensa alekhine en torneos, tampoco recuerdo partidas amistosas en donde haya ocupado esa defensa. pero esto habla de la preparación que llevo para el match. ya que en las partidas anteriores en donde alejandro ha llevado blancas generalmente ponóa a alin contra las cuerdas, ya que alin prefiria plantear la defensa pirc, en contra del 1. e4 de alejandro, y siempre quedaba con posición inferior el negro. asó que se entiende que quisiera cambiar en este match. siguiendo el camino conocido de la alekhine.  un desliz teorico, pero nada grave, generalmente se prefiere el ataque al caballo de d5, para que no este mucho tiempo ahí parado, obstaculizando en algunos casos el desarrollo blanco. además para que dejarlo ahí pareciendo un trofeo. las secuencias dentro de lo que podemos llamar normal son:
-------------------------------------
 y también la que se considera más segura
-------------------------------------
 y en otros caminos más posicionales la continuación del mismo alekhine
-------------------------------------
  esta captura es un tanto errónea, ya que las negras quedan con minoría en el ala de dama, en donde se supone que el blanco en un final de reyes y peones logran crear un peón pasado en el ala de dama y ganan.
-------------------------------------
 pero como decía el gran steinitz, los dioses han puesto el medio juego antes del final.
-------------------------------------
 lo cierto es que 4.- ...exd6 es más seguro un error de novato, lo correcto es c4 ganando espacio y espabilando al caballo negro. después tranquilamente jugamos ae2, con la defensa indirecta del peón c4 por el jaque de dama en a4.
-------------------------------------
 siempre en este sistema defensivo hay que tomar en cuenta que la idea estratégica del negro es atacar el centro de peones blanco, y para eso regalaron tiempos moviendo al caballo. pero si el blanco no juega de forma activa se queda el blanco sin desarrollo de piezas y menos con centro fuerte.
-------------------------------------
 las odeas estratégicas repito, son:
-------------------------------------
 blanco: crear un centro de peones fuerte, si es móvil es mucho mejor.
-------------------------------------
 negro: permitir que el blanco controle el centro del tablero, para después atacarlo por medio de las jugadas ...c5, ...cc6, ...e6 seguido de ...d5.
-------------------------------------
  entra en las jugadas llamadas simples y normales. aunque si se quiere jugar para mantener al caballo en d5, sería preferible jugar en este momento ...g6, seguido de ...ag7; controlando la diagonal a1-h8. apesar de la presencia del alfil negro en g4, practicamente el caballo de f3 es incomible, por que debilitaría gravemente la posición negra en el ala de dama. por ejemplo la diagonal de h1-a8 ya es muy débil hay no haber peón en la columna c. es por eso que resulta la jugada ...ag4 una pérdida de tiempo, cini se cimprobará adelante en los comentarios a la partida.  sigue el camino conocido, pero; vuelve a ser mejor la jugada intermedia c4 para espantar al caballo negro de d5. es el que acabó matando a la dama blanca. 
-------------------------------------
 en esta variante vemos la necesidad de mantener al alfil negro de g4, no se podrá cambiar por el caballo, lo cual represento la jugada ...ag4 un error bastante cuestionable. protección del rey, necesaria para comenzar el ataque. un error serio que debería costar la partida, o por lo menos entrega las riendas de la partida a las blancas. la posición en la defensa alekhine para el negro se vuelve complicada precisamente por errores de este tipo. las negras deben ser cuidadosas al desarrollar las piezas, la dama negra no cumple ninguna labor de apoyo en la casilla b6, sino al contrario, la quita al caballo esa importante casilla de retirada. este movimiento ya representa un error serio, por que el alfil no podra regresar a defender a su rey. la variante correcta aqui es:
-------------------------------------
 con posición complicada pero en donde el blanco lleva las riendas de la partida. esta clase de errores, si debo comentarlos, aqui ganaba otra pieza, mediante ta7, obligando a ac8, después el rey negro camina hasta d6 se juega entonces cb4, tc7 y se gana el alfil intruso. la última esperanza. vale la pena aún creer en los reyes magos. se rinden las blancas. 
-------------------------------------
defensa francesa, claro. variante del cambio, me gusta. estupendo, ahora sólo me falta af5 y cc6. vaya, ya no valen ni af5 ni cc6. tras mucho pensar opté por lo más "natural" aunque hay opciones mucho mejores, lo sé. ahora sí. ¡fuera bicho! si no se puede por c6 habrá que ir por d7 (y luego a f8) vaya, tendría que haber jugado yo te8 antes... una jugada rara. no me gustaba la idea de que cambiar torres en e8 y acabar con mi dama en la columna abierta (aunque eso no tenía nada de malo, la verdad) y además con ésta podía hacer cf8, dd7 y doblar torres en e, ésa era mi idea. sigo mi idea. y sigo con ella, que además me sirve para proteger el caballo. ahora el blanco me parece que tiene poco que hacer salvo quizá intentar doblar torres, parece bastante maniatado, pero... hum, no me gustaría nada 16. af4 así que... evita af4 pero era mucho mejor g5, que sirve para lo mismo, y entonces sí cg6 con buenas perspectivas de ataque. vaya, quiere hacer c4 para liberarse un poco. y yo defiendo d5 dos veces y me doy la posibilidad de formar "la máquina". aquí está. y se me ocurre la peor jugada posible... ahora el alfil tiene un objetivo y se puede liberar. era mucho mejor y servía para lo mismo te8. lo esperado. no me gustó retomar de dama por cc3. ¡ahí lo tienes! me autoclavo pero no vi nada mejor, además el caballo está mejor ahí. incómoda, pero aparentemente está todo protegido. me desclavo. (no valía directamente en la jugada anterior porque perdía el caballo). ayayay. ¿ahora qué? bueno, quito el caballo y en paz ¿no? ¡pero ahí no! muchísimo mejor y casi que ganadora directamente era ce4. por qué no la vi se escapa a mi comprensión... hala, peón perdido y alfil atacado (aunque su caballo también lo está). eso debería haberme dado la idea de 23...axh2+ 24 rxh2 dxd5 y recuperaba el peón con mejor posición, pero no lo vi. lo que aparecía recurrentemente en mi cabeza era cf4, pero no valía directamente... así que pensé ésta. es bastante conceptual después de todo y si mi rival pica el anzuelo y cambia piezas, que es bastante lógico, pues mejor aún: me gano calidad. y picó... gracias. ahora amenazo dama y jaque doble ganando la torre. buena idea pero sigue valiendo el jaque y hasta de8 e incluso dg4. yo a lo mío. bueno, mira por dónde al final he quedado ganado. ahora a ganar. a fastidiar y a llevar la torre arriba. primero a dejar de preocuparme por los peones. y ahora a activar la torre. mala jugada, era mucho mejor y lógica tc7. o cambiamos pieza o me gano un peón. ¡mejor aún! ahora las dos cosas. y un peón más de regalo. ya está todo hecho. esperaba una rendición en cualquier momento pero mi rival quiso jugar hasta el final. la puntilla final... y así terminó mi primera victoria frente a un rival con elo (hasta ahora sólo había conseguido tres tablas frente a rivales con 1400). por supuesto, las variantes buenas me las dio el gm alfredo giaccio en nuestra clase de ayer. 
-------------------------------------
mi clásico d4 para jugar el gambito de dama bien, nada raro. estupendo, hasta aquí todo bien, todo según mi teoría. jugada 6 y ya la he cagado. mi teoría dice que aquí he de jugar 6. cxd5 para no perder un tiempo con el alfil si ahora mi rival jugara 6... dxc5. pero, por mucho que he repasado en las últimas semanas que cuando el alfil malo está fuera de la cadena de peones hay que comer en d5 para no perder tiempo con el alfil bueno a la hora de la verdad ni lo dudé... y lo hice mal. otra buena oportunidad de hacer 8. cxd5 desaprovechada, sobre todo ahora que está claro que serviría para molestar al alfil que va a ir a b7 esta jugada encaja con el plan original (¡si hubiera comido en d5!) del ataque de las minorías pero, claro, como me he saltado la teoría ahora no vale para nada y es malísima... ahora sí que recordé que con los peones negros en c5 y d5 había que comer en d5 sí o sí ahora se imponía haber comido en c5 y así tener un plan claro: atacar los peones colgantes en c5 y d5. yo en cambio me dediqué a gastar 10 minutazos del reloj intentando decidir dónde poner mi dama. en d2 no me gustaba por 11. ce4 así que dc2 que hice. nada más presionar el reloj me recorrió un sudor frío al ver que con c4 me atrapaban mi alfil bueno... o eso pensé yo. respiré hondo y vi que valía af5 y ¡hasta axh7+ ganando un peón! mi rival no se dio cuenta así que... ¡toma ya! peón ganado. si 12... cxh7 13 axe7 vale, me vuelvo a f5 y en paz. con peón de más... ¡a cambiar piezas! pero es muy mala idea. mejor hubiera sido h3 y problema resuelto... ¿estupendo, no? pues no... véase lo que sigue. ahora está claro que había que haber jugado 14. exf4 pero es que ni lo pensé... ¿ahora qué? pues estoy perdido, sin más. prácticamente obligada esta jugada no me dice nada así que... habrá que ocupar la columna abierta ¿no? ¿cómo? bueno, mejor quitar la dama por si acaso... ¡¿otra vez?! pues a la tercera fila se ha dicho aunque el rey se haya ido siempre es bueno quitarle casillas de escape y él se da un escape... ahora es más difícil el mate, jo... sigamos sumando piezas al flanco de rey, no hay otra... vale a la columna abierta que siempre puede ser útil (y en esta ocasión lo será, y mucho) antes de proteger el peón b un jaquecito para acercar al rey a la columna abierta y darme la posibilidad de dar luego jaque con la torre en h8 ahora sí, protejo b2 uy, aquí ya me empezó a dar miedo la cosa. ¿como salir de ésta? 26. ad3 parece evidente pero tras cambiar alfiles b2 cae igualmente así que mejor dar b2 y conservar el alfil... quién sabe... ahora sí me gustó porque se me ocurrió que tras cambiar alfiles th8+ y re7 sería peligroso... y después de esto aún más... ahora la dama está a tiro de jaque descubierto si el rey va a e7. ¡probémoslo! ven a e7, rey, ven a e7... (28... cc8 hubiera sido un corte de rollo pero con 29.ah7 se seguía presionando bastante ¿no?) ¡y vino! ¡ya eres mío! redoble de tamborrr... ¡tachán! ¡me gano la dama y la partida! ole y después de estos bonitos cambios el resultado no puede ser más favorable. lástima que me quedaran 12 minutos en el reloj y a él 68... todavía había que sufrir... un jaque para evitar el mate... y listo ¿en serio? otro jaque al canto (soñaba con que se fuera a la esquina y se metiera en red de mate) pero no cayó... a cambiar piezas, que me conviene ¡una menos! a ver adónde vas ahora... sigue atacando d4 que es imperativo que no caiga pero de momento está bien protegido aunque sería recomendable quitar a la dama de tan prosaica misión... antes hay que intentar activar al alfil (no me parece ahora el mejor modo pero en agobios de tiempo es lo que se me ocurrió) lo esperado. ¡un minuto y medio me quedaba en el reloj aquí! tenía el corazón a mil pero al menos ya tenía un plan: acercar el rey al centro y liberar la dama. ¿eso encierra la torre, no? pues sí. aquí mi rival me ofreció tablas que, lógicamente, rechacé se acabó la cosa. ahora tenía tres minutos en el reloj y podía jugar la dama a placer... jaque y... se acabó. mi rival se rindió, caía todo. bien que se lo agradecí. una partida lamentable con final feliz pero... el jaque descubierto es bonito ¿eh? 
-------------------------------------
yo siempre d4. justo la apertura que había repasado en mi clase de esa semana. algo así da mucha confianza. primer error de concepto: le doy vida a su alfil malo si retoma de peón. por suerte para mí lo hace de caballo lo que me da ventaja. sigo con mi desarrollo normal. ésta jugada me pareció flojilla y me dio más confianza aún. oh, esto no lo esperaba. a ver qué hace este alfil. ¡gracias! aquí debería haber olido el peligro... (amenaza cerrar el centro y yo tengo ahora pareja de alfiles). jugada mala y pasiva. debería haber evitado 11...e4 jugando dc2 o hasta cg3. grrr. ¿ahora qué? esta jugada es mala. debería haber jugado ac2 por concepto (mantenerme en la diagonal que he elegido) e intentar atacar e4 más adelante. sin embargo, como estaba tan positivo y harto de que me dijeran que me quedo siempre atrás me fui para adelante ya que al menos clavaba el caballo... bueno, no pasa nada. esta jugada la hice pensando en hacer después d5 creyendo que ganaba el caballo clavado en c6... pero ahora me di cuenta de que no valía así que... bueno, luchemos por la columna semiabierta. y pongámosle presión a e4. ésta la hice pensando en cd5 a la siguiente si ahora defendía el peón con la dama... cosa que hizo. allá voy. ahora amenazo a la dama y a c7 con lo que si vuelve a d8, pensé, no sé si tendré algo pero él está muy pasivo. ¡pero se fue a g5! vale, sacrifica c7 y va a por el mate pero pensé que lo defendía fácil con g3 y me daba tiempo a volver hasta cf4 (sin ver que su cf3+ era mortal). así, mi razonamiento fue: yo como, él mueve la torre atacada de e8 y yo vuelvo tranquilamente a f4 a tiempo. ahora es mate en nueve para el negro según mi ordenador, empezando por 18... ch4 19 g3 cf3+ supongo... pero por suerte para mí hace lo que yo había previsto. y atacando de nuevo la torre me da tiempo a volver. y ahora mi caballo defiende todo de maravilla. y de paso me regala otro peón centralizando la dama. con dos peones de ventaja ni me lo pensé: a cambiar. es un error porque quedamos con alfiles de distinto color lo que es darle opciones de tablas si algo va mal. ups. aquí sin razón aparente empecé a jugar rápido e hice la peor jugada posible. ay. infeliz de mí hice esta jugada sin pensar. me dije: ahora ataco el alfil con dos piezas y me lo gano... pero no, claro. y ahora sí que tengo un problema: el alfil apunta a mi punto débil en g2. pensé hasta en hacer ch3 intentando cambiar damas, pero no quería quitar el caballo de f4, así que... a ver qué pasa ahora. la cosa no llega a mate pero con algún sacrificio por ahí seguramente me pueda hacer mucho daño... no se puede comer esta torre por que sería mate en g2 pero, mira tú por dónde, ahora puedo cerrar la diagonal y dar un doble. ¡toma ya! ¿me como la torre o el alfil? el alfil y así amenazo coronar con mate. única, aunque por un instante pensé que sacrificando la dama daba mate. suerte que vi enseguida que no porque podía retomar con la torre. ¿y esto? ¿tendrá mate forzado? creo que no, que se dejó llevar por el que yo no podía retomar de peón. ¡pero sí de caballo! adiós partida. cambio caballos y amenazo mate. pero él sólo ve que amenazo la torre, así que... ... fin de la historia. 
-------------------------------------
la variante di cambio in genere prelude a partite assai tranquille. questo non sarà il caso. il nero preferisce rompere la simmetria. un seguito poco usato. più solida è 8... o-o  il seguito più usato in precedenza 10... f5 non aveva dato buona prova  ora 11... f5 lascerebbe il nero in posizione difficile dopo 12. dh5+  era meglio arroccare immediatamente anche se il bianco avrebbe mantenuto un buon vantaggio posizionale  perdente, ma il bianco aveva comunque ottenuto un considerevole vantaggio di posizione sembra che questo sacrificio conduca solo alla patta ... ma sembra soltanto alcuni commentatori hanno sostenuto che il nero avrebbe potuto salvarsi con  17... de5  tuttavia il bianco gioca per vincere dopo 18. axh7+ rh8 19. ag6+ rg8 20. th5!  sembra che ora il bianco debba accontentarsi della ripetizione di mosse ...  sorpresa! impedendo la spinta in f5 il bianco vince. vediamo:  23...rg8 24. tch4 e ora a) 24... f6 25. ag6! b) 24... g6 25. th8+ rg7 26. t1h7+ rf6 27. txf8  e vince

hi everyone!  so in my last annotated game against the caveman, coach ion concluded that fou leblanc had let henry down a bundle by moving to the wrong square.  in this game i find myself in another piece ending and with both sides having light square bishops.  in the endgame i end up being the player with the pawn plus against my fellow class a opponent.  but will this give fou leblanc the opportunity to make amends and to help henry bring the game to a satisfactory conclusion? well, you'll just have to read on. 1. ….. d5 - white kicks off with the reti opening and i make the most common response to it. 3. c4 - transposing into a queen's gambit. 5. bxc4 - and now it is a qga. 6. ….. e6 - preparing to develop fou lenoir. 7. ……. bb4 - pin. 8. bd2 - unpin. 9. ……. 0-0 - both kings tuck themselves away on the kingside. 10. rc1?! - this move starts off some explosive activity in the centre and this is where i end up with the pawn plus. 14. ……. qd2 - after a whirlwind of captures and exchanges glenda takes evasive action. 15. bd3 - clever.  if glenda should play qxc3?? then bxh7+ loses her to the wq.  so on the next turn she retreats to h6. 17. bxe4 - knight trade. 19. qc7 - sssss - nasty - nasty! 19. ….. bb5 - but fou leblanc is able to escape with a threat. 20. rfc1 - of which white parries strongly. 22. …… qd8 - trying to trade my way out of passivitis but white declines the queen trade. 24. ……. qxc8 - but there is a rook trade. 26. rc7 - again very nasty, but glenda now puts the wk in old matey's shadow. 26. ……. qd3 - yup, qf1# is threatened. 28. qe1 - defends pawn on b4. 29. ……. qb2 - taking control of the a1-h8 diagonal before the wq does. 31. rxc3 - now the queens have finally been traded off.  i am still a pawn up, but will it be enough to win in what is now an endgame?  we shall see. 33. rb3 - everything is being concentrated on the weakie pawn on b4. 34. ….. bxd3 - and now we have that bishop ending.  now henry needs to get to the pawn on b4 before the wk does. 36. …..kf8 - henry starts his march. 40. ….. h6 - pawn wall. 42. …..hxg5 - pawn trade. 44. f5 - trying to create a block.  i am, however, prepared to be very patient. 46. …..kc6 - henry continues his mission to try and gobble up that juicy looking b4 pawn. 50. ….. kxa5 - however, after getting nowhere we have a pawn trade.  i do at least get a passer on the e column, but will i be able to push it?  we shall see. 53. ……. kc2 - henry is now trying to get over to the kingside so that he can perhaps take off one or both of the remaining white pawns and shepherd one of my kingside pawns through to glendadom. 55. ……. ke1 - these checks have just driven henry ever closer to the white pawns. 58. …… bf3 - now fou leblanc is doing well.  i now plan to exchange my e pawn for white's g4 pawn.  i will then put henry on f2 and that will give my g pawn a protected path to glendadom.  after i took the pawn on g4 on the next turn, white realised my plan and waved the white flag.  good work in the end by fou leblanc.  wheew!  
-------------------------------------
so my fellow comrades decide to play the classical kings indain. most times, it ends in a tactical draw. though i think white has the better chances for a win. this opening choice no doubt has one of our better players on the team's influence. he is an expert in the kid. at this point i was aiming for a catalan formation with g3 and bg2  discouraging black most natural way to free himself. which is ....nh5 followed by the tactical ...f5. at that is what black aims for most cases in the kings indain.   in  a game back in 2005 abitipower and i came to a similar position where i had played the much slower d4-d5(attempting to block out the dsb). nowadays, be3 is arguable the move of choice. for one it sets up the favorable macrozy bind. according to the comments on the form page my comrades were expecting 7. d5 with a good chance that ...nh5 and ...f5 are to follow.   !? i like and dislike this move by my comrades. i like it because it gains valuable initiative on the e3-bishop. on the other hand black invests considerable king side weaknesses to gain that initiative.   !? a critical moment in the game. black has committed himself for boom or bust on the king side. meanwhile, white still temporarily has his centre and a slight lead in development. all and all though the game is dynamically level.  alternative variation: 9... nc6 10. d5 nd4 11. nxd4 exd4 12. qxd4 g5 13. bg3 f5 [⩲]  expected black wants to get in his favored ...f5. at this point i see that there is no real good way for me to stop it so i decide not try. what i plan to do is make good use of the king side weakness. at this point i was not sure how i was going to do that.  ⇄ black has to play this double edged move if he hopes to get in ...f5. reason being is that they have to deflect my f-knight away from contesting g5 so that ...f5 can be played without worrying about the weakness created on g5. even so, the holes on black's king side begin to show signs of fatigue.  i kinda like this move. it hits at black's most pressing weakness while at the same time adds a much needed offensive to white's game. the opening of the h-file will be of great use for me. so i am willing to concede control of the f-file to black for the time being. this is a move that i expect came as a surprise to most engaged in the game.   i have no intention of wasting time castling. along with 13. h4 i planed to activate my rook on the h-file.  the king will stay in the center to help support f2 for now.   the pressure on f2 begins to mount. i must admit that i knew instinctively that i was fine defensively but i also knew that i needed to get things going offensively quickly.  so far so good i have managed to frustrate my comrades on the f-file. though they do have respectable pressure on f2 it is not enough for a break through. i would have to give them leading edge in this position. especailly, after their next move.   ! a very awkward moment for me. i am forced to retreat the knight back to c3 and allow black greater share of the centre. not to mention deflecting a piece away from the defense of f2. as you can see f2 becomes the focal point for sometime. meanwhile the pawn on h6 lays quietly just waiting to be picked off.   this move does look good but i think black is over estimating their chances on f2.  alternative variation: 17... bxc3+ 18. bxc3 bg4 19. f3 be6 20. kf2 maybe black's only opportunity to get out with a draw.   !! i give this a brilliance because the reason for it is obvious and subtle. the king is taking matters of his own safety into his hands by walking himself to g1. castling is out because then black would be able to take on h6 with a guaranteed draw.  i would say that black is doing ok but the picture is starting to become very complex for him. even the chess engine suggests 18.0-0 but i was felt that the rook had better chances of getting action via the h-file. i also felt that i had to keep the h6-pawn because it was controlling the critical mating square of g7.   this little sac is what makes 18. kf1 so amazing. i mean who has the balls to put their king on a open file controled by the enemy rook+queen!  ! the knight returns! this move is what makes 18.kf1 work. black does not have a discover check because of fork on his queen. thus black will have to retreat the queen and allow white to regain the material. still the wide open f-file dominated by the black rook keeps black in the game.   !! as my comrade blunderball and pawnrider pointed out 21. qd5 leads to a long fighting draw. i found this move as an alternative. it services two purposes, first it guards f2 and gets the king off the hot f-file.   alternative move: 21. qd5+?! qxd5 22. cxd5 ne5 23. rh5 bf5  by now black has almost depleted himself against my pawn wall, which is a typical thing that my opponents do against me. meanwhile my white troops are about to fulfill their destiny.  ! if i had castled back at move 18. this initiative gaining move would not be possible. like i said earlier the benefits of 18. kf1 are more than the obvious.   ?! it is hard to discredit such a naturally good looking move but this is problematic for black. #1 it temporarily lessens the pressure on f2 long enough for me to better position my dsb. #2 i really do think that 22...qg6 followed ...be6 or ...bd7 is the only way out for black.  alternative variation: 22... be6 23. rg5+ kh8 24. qd2 rf6 25. rf1 is roughly equal  nasty little move isn't it! opens the a2-g8 diagonal for the lsb, undermines the e5-knight and gains tempo for qd2. my plan is to gain control of the g-file. i feel that if i can succeed in that then my chances of success are really high.   controlling the critical g5 square.   only move alternative variation: 24... raf8 [?!] 25. rg5+ bg6 26. bd4 [±]  +⁠− black's long standing pressure on f2 has been eliminated. while white has built a strong initiative on e5 and the g-file.   black has multiple threats to deal with can you list them?  of course note 29. qxc2?  alternative variation: 29. qxc2 bxc2 30. cxd6 cxd6 31. rc1 be4 [ with a small possibility of a hard long fight to a draw for black.]   the bishop pair work better that a queen.   no matter what now black will go down in material. plus with pawn majorities on both sides of the board white's triumph is assured.   i was superised to read my comrades chatter at this point which revealed no talk of defeat. either they did not understand that they were about to go down a pawn. or they were being hopefully optimistic.   the king finally escapes from his dungeon but a little to little now.   alternative variation: equally good is 38. bxe5 dxe5 39. kf2 bf7 40. a3 bb3 41. ke3 kf7 42. be4 kf6 43. bxh7 kg5 44. bf5 kxh6 45. ke4  the pawn on a5 will fall and there is no way of stopping the white rook pawn  
-------------------------------------
annotated by mark taimanov in march 2004, nearly 33 years after the match. my idea of presenting it here is for the lessons we can learn from this game. "i had no doubts that this position will appear in our match, and probably my opponent had similar expectations.  both of us belonged to a category of polemists of principle, ready to assert our belief in the king’s indian ‘tableau’, which was always a favorite weapon for me with white and for fischer with black.  but who would have the first opportunity to present a prepared surprise?"  fischer might have expected here 9.ne1, 9.nd2, or 9.b4, which had repeatedly featured in my games.  i worked out with my second especially for this match this calm developing move with the bishop, which has the goal of prompt mobilization of forces of the queenside. fischer was always most versed in opening subtleties of his favorite systems. he certainly knew that a conventional maneuver 9...nh5 here is inexpedient in view of 10.g3 f5 11.exf5 bxf5 12.ng5 nf6 13.g4 bd7 14.nge4 nxe4 15.nxe4. the move 10.b4 has been frequently tested here, however i rejected it as superfluous to the scheme i had prepared. this position was already essayed in our first game of the match.  there i played 11.exf5 and then 11...gxf5 12.ng5 h6 13.ne6 bxe6 14.dxe6 qc8 15.qb3 c6 led to a double-edged position with mutual chances.  that game proceeded fascinatingly, the scales inclined to one side then the other several times.  i was the last to make a mistake in time trouble and lost the game, but it was obvious that the opening conversation had not been exhausted, and that the discussion would be continued.  so, it happened. my innovation comes first!  this follows my preparation for the duel!  the main idea from the first game remains: transfer the knight to e6 followed by opening the center, but the text sharply enlivens the tactical set-up.  the queen from b3 'x-rays' the black king, and simultaneously 'looks' at the b7-pawn, which could be vulnerable to capture after an eventual exchange of the bishop for the e6-knight.  the theoretical dispute with fischer has found a new impulse! fischer thought on this reply for a long time (which testifies to the advantage obtained by his opponent's home preparation) and probably came to the conclusion of the necessity of first stopping the advance c4-c5, which promotes white's chances to open the strategically important c-file.  subsequently analysts put forward alternative ideas of merit - 11. f4 (i. boleslavsky) and 11... kh8 (m. tal). it is always basic with fischer.  with 12... nxf5 or 12... bxf5, white's possession of the outpost e4 ensures a stable positional advantage the general plan in operation – the knight is aiming at e6  in case of 13...h6 14.ne6 bxe6 15.dxe6 qc8 (or 15...c6 16.bh5!) a highly advantageous continuation for white is 16.nd5 qxe6 17.nxe7+ qxe7 18.c5+ kh8 19.cxd6 nxd6 (or 19...cxd6 20.rfd1) 20.rc6!, confirmed by my game with m. tseitlin played two years later. an important part of the preconceived plan, whose value fischer apparently underestimated... fischer trusts in the reliability of black's formation and bravely enters uncompromising conflict. more circumspect, but also more "yielding" would have been 14...e4.  however in this case white gains obvious positional advantages by way of 15.nd1 h6 16.nh3 followed by ne3, nf2 and bc3.  such conformism is alien to fischer and he never opted for such passive continuations. certainly fischer must not have liked the continuation 15...hxg5 16.exf6 bxf6 17.bh5. but i think this blow turned out to be an unexpected and distressing surprise for fischer.  the battery of white pieces has come into action!  however, had i been in a less martial mood, i might have contented myself with the quiet 16.nf3, maintaining white's doubtless positional plusses. (my humble comment: this move is the cause of rapid deterioration of white's advantage. 16.nf3 as taimanov notes is the correct move to maintain white's advantage. here the psychology of taimanov is revealed! he was in an aggressive mood and relied on attack and ignored the requirements of the position. have we all also fallen prey to such emotions in our games? sure we did. it is part of the learning in this game. chess logic overrides emotions and player strengths. we have to play according to the requirements of the position. ) it is obvious that the alternative 16...hxg5 17.d6+ kh8 18.dxe7 qxe7 19.cxb6 axb6 20.bxg5 was quite unattractive, as well as the reply 16...kh8 in view of 17.d6!  hand-to-hand fighting begins where courageous imagination, exact calculation and ... strong nerves are required.  by the way, in this game, nerves "played pranks" on both players. certainly the continuation 18...hxg5 19.bxg5 qd6 20.b7 bxb7 21.qxb7 is not advantageous for black. the "salt" of the large-scale tactical operation begun by white nine moves back!  all white's pieces have occupied threatening positions, and the threat of eventually supplementing the attack with the addition of a bishop at c4 throws my opponent into emergency mode. perhaps the only means of defense. in case of 19...hxg5 20.bc4 kh8 21.bxd5 f4 (or 21...g4) 22.rc3! with the double threat of 23. rh3+ and 23. bxa8, which is impossible to prevent.  i do not stint on one more diagram as it not only reflects both the culmination and turning-point of this game, but the match as a whole.  fischer himself later recognized it: "it was the turning point of the match.  taimanov missed a win by 20. qh3."  it additionally serves as a reference point to all the subsequent and unpredictable dramatic peripeteias [ed. philosophical self-questioning, aristotle] which befell me.  i remember that at that moment i felt a veritable ecstasy from the struggle - i estimated the position as rather advantageous.  i trusted in success, pleased at my good luck employing my opening preparation, and in the idea of rapid development of the initiative -and the maneuver 20. qh3, for example.  was it was possible to anticipate that all this would turn to ashes?!  disappointment began from the moment when i, cheerfully having estimated the position, began to concretely calculate variations.  it was obvious that after 20.qh3 black in view of the threat 21. rxh6+ has only two defenses - 20...nf6 and 20...rf6.  i began to examine them in the happy belief that any attempt to cover the gaping approaches to the black king would be impossible.  the move 20...nf6 really did not shake my optimism.  variations found without any special work are: 20.qh3 nf6 21.bc3 f4 ( other continuations are worse. for example, 21...bd7 22.ne6 bxe6 23.rxe6; or 21...ng4 22.rg6! rf6 23.qh5) 22.qh4 bb7 ( 22...qe8 23.bf3!) 23.rd1 qe7 24.re6 qc5+ 25.kh1 are obviously developments to white's benefit.  but i couldn’t find any decisive continuation on 20...rf6 in any continuation.  first it seemed to me that good is 21.qh5, but in testing it i didn’t like 21...bd7! 22.rxf6 qxf6 23.nf7+ kh7 24.nxh6 bxh6 25.bxh6 qg6!.  the idea of 21.nf7+ rxf7 22.bxh6 was entertained, but i found a refutation at once in 22...bf6.  at last i found the best plan: 21.bc4! when really, in view of 21...rxc6 22.nf7+, the white rook is impregnable.  now 22.rxf6 is simply threatened, and both replies 21...bd7 22.bxd5 and 21...bb7 22.rxf6 qxf6 23.rxf5 are poor.  it would seem that the required decision has held up to scrutiny, but is complicated by the response 21… f4.  to everything that i have here examined, alas, there was an objection:  on 22.qh5 possible was 22...bb7 23.bxd5 (or 23.rxf6 qxf6) 23...qxd5; on 22.qh4 - bb7 23.ne6 qd7; on 22.qd3 - 22...hxg5 23.rxf6 bxf6; and finally on 22.qf3!? - bb7! 23.rxf6 (23.ne6 qd7! 24.bxd5 rxe6!) 23...nxf6! 24.nf7+ kh7 25.qxb7 (25.bd3+ kg8!) 25...qxd2 26.qxa8 qd4+ 27.kh1 qxc4.  in all variations fischer emerges in the clear.  it was amazing!  all my understanding of chess, all my experience and flair convinced me this position should be won, but concrete ways to victory did not appear.  disappointed in 20. qh3!, i began to evaluate other ideas - 20. rd1, 20. bc4, but the capitulation...(my humble addition, emmanuel lasker said, "the difficult part of chess is to win a won game". how prophetic!!! it is no wonder that lasker is called "thinker of chess". it is amazing that fischer himself thought that 20. qh3! would win for white and probably would have psychologically surrendered the game. finally, 20. qh3 is in fact the best move here although it does not win against accurate play. who knows what would have happened if that move was played. was it destiny favoring fischer? :) a magnificent idea.  by exchanging the opponent's dark-squared bishop, fischer deprives white of any further illusions. at the cost of a deterioration in the central pawn structure, fischer opens the game and the bishops find their invincible power.  it is one more example of his favorite method of transformation of one kind of advantage to another. fischer is in his element.  intercepting the initiative, he develops offensive potential all over the board with irrepressible energy.  first of all he threatens 26... bd5. a hope to simplify the defense by eventual rook exchanges turned out to be in vain. better is 28.ne1 a universal maneuver - it prevents simplifications, (29.re8?? bc6)  and creates a terrible threat: 29... bc5+  black's attack develops itself, and his doubled pawns provide important outposts for his pieces. the evidence of hopelessness and confusion.  in any case more persistent would be 30.qb5 so that in the event of 30...qe3+ 31.kf1 rd1+, to be protected by the move 32.ne1.  alas, at this moment i no longer owned my nerves...(my humble observation: look at that comment !! "i no longer owned my nerves" a grandmaster is reduced to nothing!) nothing changes by 31.rxd8 bxa4 32.rxf8+ kg7 the rest is clear and simple without need of comment. in this position the game was adjourned and, certainly, i resigned without resuming play.  perhaps, it is the most bitter game of my life.  i felt it sharply at first, then painfully for many years...  (my humble comments:  lessons i have learnt from this famous game are given below: 1. positional assessment is difficult for even the top players including fischer. so play carefully trying to assess the position as the moves unfold. 2. when your idea fails, don't start brooding, accept the position and play for a draw at least. 3. expect the unexpected!  4. take it as only a  game. don't get psychologically wrecked by one game. mark taimanov's contributions to opening theory are well respected in benoni, king's indian defence and sicilian. so after all it is a game, enjoy it!!!) 
-------------------------------------
susan starts here with, "it is smart for carlsen to avoid the petroff, a caruana specialty! i expect a long strategical battle today! the qg is very common in wc matches." i used to like to play this line a lot. magnus had this position after 10rd1 several times already (against nakamura)  the encouraging sign is caruana's speed of play today. he is much faster and seems to be more confident.  10...be7 used to be the most popular, while lately lots of games with 10...re8.  while 10...rd8 is not a new move, according to my database magnus never faced it before. that is why he is taking his time.  the most common move here is 11. nd2, played by petrosian before in the 60's. if black plays 11...dxc4 then white has a comfortable position.  however, if 11...d4 it can lead to interesting complications where black sacrifices a piece. so this is why carlsen is trying to decide how to proceed here. carlsen usually prefers quiet position advantage then squeeze while caruana excels more in dynamic positions. so carlsen must decide what type of game will he allow. this is all about match strategy, and sometimes carlsen is known to play inferior moves just to shift the dynamic of the positions. carlsen chose to play it safe to avoid the likely home-prep of caruana in the complicated 11 nd2 d4 line. the guessing game in world championship matches is intense. players must try to figure out what surprises the opponents have. sometimes, lots of bluffing 😅 if 12. o-o nxc3 13. bxc3 as black cannot take the pawn on a3. if 13... qxa3?? 14. ra1 traps the queen or if 13...bxa3? the bishop gets into trouble after the pin with 14. ra1.  of course caruana did not fall for the elementary trap. 🤣 hey, but this is educational for the novice players at home 😃 ​what you are seeing is the behind the scene thinking of these players in a world championship match. i remember this from my own match in 1996. a lot of guessing game and my team did a better job surprising my opponent.  so when you see players sitting and thinking in what seems to be "normal" positions, what they are doing is try to figure out the potential landmines of home preparation. it is not like they are day dreaming or think about dinner 😅 now you can see why caruana is a worthy challenger. he is very diligent with his training. i have known him since he was about 6 years old when he started playing his first tournaments at my chess club in ny. lou, his dad, has always been very supportive of his chess. and he was never afraid to ask for advice so his son can have the best path forward. just like yesterday, white is in an uncomfortable position. carlsen needs to put the brakes and try to consolidate and hold this game. i do not like his position at all. caruana plays really fast today, and much more confidently. if 17... nxf4 18. exf4 bxe5 19. rxd8+ qxd8 20. fxe5 = carlsen smells danger and hopes to trade pieces to head to equal endgame to salvage this game and fight another day. caruana on the other hand should try to keep up the intensity in this game and not simplify. in chess, especially in a world championship match, momentum is so important. if carlsen converted yesterday, things could have been so different. but he let caruana off the hook and it may come back to bite him. it is interesting that caruana is following the line i suggested. black is completely fine, maybe even easier to play. but i thought he may be suited to keep things complicated a little longer to burn more time off carlsen's clock. they are following the exact same suggestion i made. white has 2 isolated pawns. black has a slight development problem with the bishop on c8. so i evaluate this to be equal and the game should head to a peaceful draw. now white needs to maintain pressure on the b7 pawn and keeps the bishop back on c8. forget about the e5 pawn for now. so 21. rb1 is a good option. carlsen is very smart. he knew that he was outplayed in the opening in spite of having white. so he changed the dynamic of the game immediately, and now they are heading to a "boring" endgame where he is certainly safer. this is why the man is the champion! 🏆 one of the big problems in chess for many players, including grandmasters, is how to change the dynamic of the games mid-stream. some have their minds set on some ideas, and they refuse to change course. to be successful, one must be flexible and objective. hard to do for many! i am not terribly impressed with this move. i prefer 23. qd6. carlsen is still ok. but i think this game, even if it ends in a draw, will give a big boost in confidence for caruana. it also sends a message that caruana's team is strong and they are doing their jobs well. the question is how will players react as the match momentum constantly shifts from game to game. this is one possibility bxf3 26. gxf3 kf8 27. c4 ke8 28. c5 kd7 29. rc1 rc830. rb1 rxc5 31. rxb7+ kxd6 32. rxa7 rc7 33. ra8 kc634. kf1 kb7 35. rg8 g6 36. ke2 ka6 37. ra8+ kb5 38. ke3 rc3+39. ke2 g5 40. rh8 kxa5 41. rxh6 rc2+ 42. ke3 = but it is white who has to play accurately to hold. when i conducted this world championship poll, out of the 1,200+ votes, about 71-72% picked carlsen to beat caruana. do you still agree after seeing this game?  this is "technically" a draw. but white has to be accurate. white needs to push c4-c5 quickly. no time to waste. otherwise, he can be in big trouble! yesterday, caruana held a r and p endgame with one pawn down. now carlsen has to do the same but in a tougher position. not an easy task! carlsen needs to push f4 now. this is an important pawn structure to hold. it should be a draw now. i realize that the norwegian fans are probably nervous now as they see that carlsen has 1 less pawn. but be assured that carlsen is not a world champion on tv. he is really good and he "should" hold this game.   it is nice for caruana to agree to a draw and not push for 100 moves like yesterday. the norwegians can go back to their business now.  so after 2 games, the score is 1-1. this is a strong bounce back and a boost of confidence for caruana. now it is the best of 10 games! 
-------------------------------------
this move came as a huge surprise for me. i did expected from carlsen to escape from the main theoretical paths , but not in such brutal way! trompovsky is rare guest in the top level. i can recall the only game with this opening system in the history of the matches for the world championship. anand won with it the last game from the match against karpov in lausanne 1998   karjakin goes for the most principle line - it is not big secret that he is perfectly prepared in the opening stage.i prefer to play here (2... e6 avoiding doubled pawns on f6 and after 3. e4 h6 4. bxf6 qxf6 5. c3 white has emerged with full centre control but black bishop pair may serve as a good weapon for achieving balanced chances in the middlegame.)   according to the theoreticians this is the best black reaction to trompovsky   this is the main theoretical flow, but nevertheless is not easy to explain the point behind white's play - to exchange just for nothing his important dark squared bishops, following by leaving black full control in the center. obviously black is going to return the pawn easily. i think white lies his hopes on retaining attacking chances against black king - as the king side pawn shelter is already compromised it might be difficult for black to find safe place for it.   (5... e6 was black choice in the game carlsen,m - kramnik,v tal memorial moscow 2013 and after 6. nf3 nd7 7. c4 dxc4 8. c6 carlsen won in 72 moves)   novelty on move 6!! it might be thoroughly prepared by carlsen and his team and amazingly he got the chance to use it already in the first game the most recent top game caruana - giri followed (6. c3 e6 7. b4 a5 8. qb3 caruana,f -giri,a london eng 2015 and white tried to defend his extra pawn by all means) (6. nc3 e6 7. na4 bxc5 8. nxc5 qa5+ 9. qd2 qxc5 10. nf3 e5 and black was fine in ivanisevic - wojtasek berlin 2015)   6... e6 karjakin tough for some 20 minutes here and he opts for the safest solution - taking back the pawn on c5 (6... qa5+ 7. nc3 a6 would have been the most chalenging continuation, it is going to be analysed in details by his team.)   this is the right decision. of course carlsen is challenging black center control (7. b4 is not good here 7... a5 8. c3 bd7 and black is on top)   again the safest option. more interesting was (7... a6 8. bxc6+ (8. ba4 dxc4 9. bxc6+ (9. nd2 bd7) 9... bxc6 10. nd2 qd5) 8... bxc6 9. qa4 rb8 10. nf3 rg8 11. o-o rxb2 12. nbd2 but it is too dangerous to try such continuations without previous analysis)  (8. qxd8+ kxd8 9. nd2 bxc5 carlsen is avoiding the queen swap endgame should be at least slightly better for black)   in my opinion black position is safe enough. karjakin looks very confident for the moment   (9.qh5 qd5) karjakin is not afraid to castle kingside - obviously he consider that white has not sufficient attacking potential.   logical continuation - black shows he is happy with further simplifications. but i see no danger for black after any of the other normal developing moves like (10... c3 or) (10... kh8 or) (10... bd7)   (in case of the immediate 12. nxc4 black has strong resourse 12... a6 for example 13. qxd8 bxd8 14. nd6 axb5 15. rxc8 rxc8 16. nxc8 f5 17. b3 bf6 18. nd6 b4 with equality)   with this move carlsen shows his intentions that he is looking for more than a comfortable draw he is threatening the knight on a5 and in the same time rise the tension against the black king -suddently ne4 looks rather unpleasant to meet obviously the endgame after (14. nxc4 rac8 15. rfd1 qc7 16. na3 qxc2 17. nxc2 rfd8 only black can play for a win because his bishop is supreme to white knight when remaining pawns are on both wings)   karjaking spent about 8 minutes in finding the best defense (in case of 14... b6 15. ne4 (15. nxc4 rac8 16. qd2 is only equal) 15... e5 16. rfd1 qe6 17. ng3 rfd8 18. nh4 bf8 19. nhf5 white probably has sufficient compensation for a missing pawn but hardly more than that)   there is no more ideas to try and carlsen goes for seemingly drawish endgame. still nothing is yet decided as with white is playing the greatest ever endgame master in chess history   with idea to follow up with rd7 (22.ne5 rd5) well known endgame principle is that bishop is better piece than the knight when pawns are on both wings. but in such positions although black bishop has great mobility he is in fact staring in empty space and has low attacking potential. another important point is that white rook controls the more important open file -as at some point it can be activated ( rc8-b8)   (is better for black to avoid 24... h5 as after 25. h4 his pawn on h5 might be an object for attack ( ne1-g2-f4))   white knight goes in quest for probing the weakness somwhere ( d3-c5), or (d3-f4-h5)   black is in a hurry to exchange rooks ( kd8, rc7 )    i expect from karjakin the modest kd8. in case of the more active 26...kd6 white has some tricks after 27 g4 as for example 27..fg4? 28 nc5 is winning   now after 27...rc7 the rooks will be exchanged seems like the draw is becoming inevitable    it is matter of technique here. after white pushed f4 his king cannot attack the pawn on h5 so black can safely play this move avoiding any ideas connected with g4. there was of course not much for white after the immediate rook swap (27... rc7 28. rxc7 kxc7 29. g4 fxg4 30. hxg4 kd6)   (28... rc7 is now wrong 29. rxc7 kxc7 30. ne5 bxe5 31. fxe5 kc6 32. kf3 kc5 33. kf4 and white is winning 33... kb4 34. e4 fxe4 35. h4 kxb3 36. g4 hxg4 37. kxe4 kxa4 38. h5)   finally black achieved a fortress with blocking the queen side i see no way for white to break in   in this first game the champion carlsen was white. once again he showed his playing style and as in the previous two championship matches with anand he avoids direct theoretical duel (or at least in the beginning) prefers not to disturb excessively the dynamic balance and to take risk for the time being. trompovski system that carlsen chose for today's first game has a reputation as a sharp and interesting sequel which however is considered insufficient to obtain debut advantage. undoubtedly carlsen and his team payed special attention in white pieces preparation and have developed new and unexplored positions where karjakin should not have deep theoretical knowledge and will feel uncomfortably. however, the surprise today did not lead to the desired result. karjakin showed good preparation and a few precise moves (9..0-0 10 ... na5 and 14..dd5) did not allow any complications and got comfortable draw in the endgame  
-------------------------------------
center game i found this line funny. white develops now, white has to ocupate the open field. black unblocks his dsb developping for white, the question is now where to castle ? the queen side pawn structure is intact but most white pieces are on the kingside so that i choose to caste short (or maybe, not to castle at all). advancing the kingside black will probably castle short. menacing the kingside black chooss to trade (having little other choice anyway). queen aiming at the kingside developing but white occupates more space now. to prevent 13. ... nc5 14. dxc5 qxd3 not a very efficient move. 13. ... a5 or 13. ... b5 would have been better, i think. to prevent 14. ...na4 and set the rook in direct opposition with the black queen. king in safe. both players are very powerfull on the king side, material is equal, white's pawn structure is weaker because of the h pawn, white controls the center, no open file. i have the impression that the position is almost equal. white attacks black contests the center to protect the dsb trading queen on the b1-h7 diagonal enabling the queen to come on g5 white finally opts to castle  menacing the queen the queen has to drawback and white is not very satisfied of the position because it's very equilibrated except the weak h pawn. but the knight and queen protects t. to attack the e knight. to rotect the e knight - natural move. rook on the half open file. preparing to double the roof on one of the half open files. to attack e5 with numeric superiority. the doubled rooks will be on the e file. it seems the obvious move to do. black is on attack on the center.  at this moment, white lauches a complex tactical plan. the knight trade has little importance in itself but it opens the e line and prevents black to take an initiative there for it menace the f rook so that black has to take now. qd5 was another candidate but the queen would not have be aimed anylonge at g3 and h3. white's plan was to fully open the e file which he already controls and is ready to pay the price for it. everybody on attack ! one stratege said : "attack is the best defense", but in this case, i's a mistake. black probably oversaw the conséquences of the next move. menacing mate if 27. ... g6   hxg6 28 hxg6 and white is in serious trouble. if 27. ... bxe3  28. qxg7+ mate to prevent a counterattack by the queen and far more important, to prepare 29. f4 probably to avoid being in chess by 29. ne7 but thee was no risk becuse i didn't see where it could lead. so that this is a weak move. "i said anybody on attack". no other place to avoid 30. fxg5 or 30. qxg7+# now white can play the trade but there is risk because the white ing is naked, black is now ahead in material and the black queen seriously menaces the white king. almost no choice. the black king is surrounded. "la meilleure défense c'est l'attaque" said the other one and i was afraid becaus i  was not sure at all to have enough moves to se black in real trouble before he promote one of his pawns. beginning of a complicated tactical sequence. avoiding 33. nxf7 ... 34. qxg7#mate white has two possible answers the other line went : 33. ... g6 34. hxg6+ fxg6 35. qh3+#, so that black plays the proper move, being now one knight ahead but having his king totally blocked which was white's idea. white has no interest to trade. the rook is necessary to counter black's attack. black's attack... ... countered. but the rook is now blocked. blunder, it permits white to advance but i do not see what black could have plaid. now black  has little to do. it had to come. black cannot set white in chess the next move... ...so that he tries something else fork attack. black exchanges the bishop against a pawn... better than noting. natural move. if 40. ... kh8 41. hxh6 and black is quickly mate by 42. rg2+ etc.  or rh2+etc. depending on black's option. so that black plays 40. ... kg8 which is even worse... mating menace. yhe only move to avoid it is 42. ... f6 but 43. qe7 with forced mate by 44. qg7+#

 **n.b.  my reference to kittens in this annotation relates to an article i wrote in the general forums many moons ago regarding life on the expert's playing field where i envisaged myself as a little white furry kitten that had strayed onto safari land where the big cats such as lions, tigers and hornets lurk, not to mention the blazing hot sun beamed out by lightotheright!  not surprisingly i get a cattermauling! 5. ........... nf6 - i choose nf6 from the database because it is a developing move and bolsters d5. 8. 0-0-0 - i think this is where it all transposes into the richter-rauzer.  maybe b5 is a good move here, but the most popular move in the db suggests bd7 played by many an expert and master, so bd7 it is. 10. ........... h6 - the dsb is driven back to e3. 12. .......... ne5 - puts pressure on f3. 16. ......... nh5 - still in the database but this knight is gonna be dim on the rim. 17. ......... f6?! - this move was played by chaves, jorge a… (2130) v maia, marco aur… (2165) and he went on to win the game, viz:-
-------------------------------------
  in those days i opened virtually only with 1. d2-d4. against a relatively strong opponent (rated 1928 elo kbsb, when i was still unrated) i did not want to deviate from the familiar path, so back to the queen's pawn opening.    this resembles the grünfeld defence, except that white has developed nf3 instead of nc3, so black can not  exchange knights here    5... nb6 seems somewhat better: the knight on f6 shields direct pressure from bg7 and forms a target for the advance e4-e5    played to support d4 and also with the idea of continuing with qd2 and bh6 in order to exchange the strong bishop on g7    this does not look very useful. c7-c5 seems a better way to attack the white center than preparing for e7-e5. may be black moved the rook so that bh6 could be countered by bh8.   at the chess-club we had lessons by a master and this game got reviewed there - which is also why this game made it into the club magazine by the way. the master - bernard de bruycker - suggested 8... ng4 for black.   white can then continue with for instance 9. bf4 and 10. h3 but i was probably lucky black did not play this: i had completely overlooked that reply during the game, and so the move would have come as a shock and been very unsettling. at that time i resolved that i would very quickly scan all legal moves of my opponent before playing my move, but it is something i have not been able to stick too in practice... :-)  
-------------------------------------
  black's previous move has made this bishop move even stronger. covering f7 with 9... e7-e6 does not seem in line with 8... re8   controlling d5 and preparing a queen side expansion with b5    there is no reason to deviate from the plan: eliminate the strong bishop and weaken the black castle.   better was to expand immediately on the queen side with 10... b5. the knight move is weak and white could have won a pawn with 11. bxf7 kxf7 12. ng5 kg8 13. ne6 qb6/qa5 14. nxg7 rd8 15. ne6 re8 16. bf4 threatening nc7.    white is focused on his plan and misses the tactical opportunity offered. another factor contributing to the oversight may have been that i used to play quick in the opening in order to avoid time trouble - something i was susceptible to. even though - if my memory serves me right - that year was one of the last that the first time control was still the ancient 40/150.  no wonder we got home late back then... it was not always the 'après échecs'  
-------------------------------------
a long game, with many edged to edged situations. center game most usual answer gambit accepted i like this line for white has really fine possibilities of attack due to the many open lines and diagonals in exchange of his pawn main line white will probably get an isolated pawn in exchange of a strong attack black opts for the trade developping to free the lsb fork attack on b7 and f7 probably a mistake. black neglects the attack on f7 now material is equal, white is ahead in developpement, has a better control of the center but the white queen, the lsb and the f knight are under menace and, important for the game end, black's pawn structure is far better. for the moment black is forced to move the king. white proposes to trade his lsb against black's a knight. but black chooses to trade on the kingside to weaken the white king now, the first trading sequence is fisnished, the market is over. both kings are unsafe, material is equal, white is better on the center and more developped (having therefore more attacking possibilities) but his pawn structure is a disaster. to prevent 14. bg5 fork attack between king and b7 the king has to retreat black pawn structure is not as good now black develops to take control of the semi open file progressing toward the white king. a queen with a faithfull knight on her side can give dangerous attacking possibilities if the opposite king is weak, which is the case. rook on open file and open line : as mobile as possible. another candidate move was be3 to menace a 7 but the bishop has to stay on the c1 h6 diagonal to prevent qg5 aiming at f3 and preventing 18. rf5+ to advance a pawn, toward the black king and enable rf5 i judged that this move was not that dangerous, for the knight alone cannot do much arm. 19. ... qg5+ is impossible, so that this move seemed ok now the knight cannot carry on annoying the white king. to take control of the open file... ... at the price of one pawn.  21. ... rb6 might have been better (to prepare 22. ... qb8) aiming at the black king. fork attack between h pawn and queen otherwise 24. qxg7 and black is in trouble the queen is now safe forced move to protect the h pawn. if 25. ... g6 26. qf7+ and prepare a trap for the knight preventing 26. qf5  the knight has little possibilities only move the knight is trapped the white pawn structure is a disaster but white is now well ahead in material and has a threat on the black king (menacing 29. qg6+) the f5 pawn is condemned at least if 29 rxf5 the queen is not under menace but it achieves little otherwise bishop on the big diagonal. it also enable the a rook to enter in the battlefield i oversaw this move. still aiming at g7, protecting the f4 pawn and permiting the h rook to go on tour anywere on line 3. the trade on f4 is no problem for white, for it would exchange 2 rooks against one pawn and the queen, letting white ahead in material. so that black opts for something else, preventing 33. c4 enabling 33. c4 black counterattacks and can be dangerous for his 3 hight pièces are well connected and all aiming at the king. white's looking for a trade... ... which black avoids to make space for the king and enable rg4 or qe4 black takes one pawn with 3 pawns advance the trade is still ok for white. white is well ahead but cramped. his king is unsafe, the dsb and the a pawn are unprotected. one false move can lead to a disaster. i spent a lot of time thinking about each move untill the end of the game. white loses one pawn more the plan is to send the white king on the left side where it would get some protection more. attacking the h pawn... ... which white doesn't want to lose (else black will have 2 passed pawns on g and h lines) menacing 40. ... qg1+ 41. qf1 (forced move) qxf1+ mate diversion no choice enabling the white king to flee on d2 white has only one move one pace toward the left wing another pace toward the left wing : the pawns will protect his majesty and, as a fair king, he'll protect his subjects in reward. a good move, i believe. it doen't seem dangerous at first sight but black controls the important e4 square the queen is in situation to defend the left wing, menaces c7 and white proposes a trade  ... which black wisely refuses no other place (if 45. kb1 or 45. kc1, 45. ... rf1+ 46. re1 qg1 and white loses a rook. "rally to my white plumet" said henri iv of france. now the white pièces are grouped around the king. and will be harder to attack. but the white rook is still unprotected  black carries on attacking but less dangerously now. so that white can advance a bit. all the black pièces are protected. white wants to trade black again refuses white's plan is to progress with whole army on the left wing to promote a pawn or force black to exchange. black tries to attack the white army by the rear the annoying black soldier meet his doom. queen under attack as usual when in difficulty, white proposes a trade... and pin the rook menacing a rear attack i judged that the danger was not that big (the black rook is pinned)  and that the progression could carry on. to unpin the rook no mating attack was possible so long that the queen and the rook were on the same file, so that i have to find another tactic. the rook is protected. if 53. ... rf7, rhe rook would have been pinned again. only 2 more steps the rear attack iwhite feared but i'm ready for it i had overseen this move and felt suddenly unsecure the queen is back again on the same file than the rook. mate menace. black has only one available move to counter it without loosing a piece straight ahead (i believe)... ?? black should have plaid 57. ... rb5+ 58. kc2 rb8. maybe there are other solutions but i cannot find them. white finally manages to give the mate but black fought very well in the second half of the game, always threatening white despite his late in material. 
-------------------------------------
center game danish gambit developping now white has 6 pièces out against 3 for black aiming at f7 attacking the weak point menacing to eliminate one of the defensors of f7 good answer white doesn't want to draw back and carry on attacking to avoid 12. nxc4. now black has the choice. if 12. ... hxg5 13. rd1 menacing d6. probably for this reason, black chooses the other option which is worse if 12. ... hxg5 13. bxf6 gxf6 14. nd5 qe6 15. nxc7+ if  14. ... qd8 15. qc6+ qd7 16. nxf6+ ke7 17. qxd7+   in both cases the queen is lost.  so that black opts to take the bishop.     black has little other possibilities to save the rook. menacing the queen which must stay beneath the c rook. black submiteds here. i add the mate.

se optó por la apertura italiana, al parecer la favorita de hassmett en esta posición juan meruvia afirmo que era mejor la jugada ae7, sin embargo como demostraron los análisis ambas jugadas dan igualdad para ambos bandos, claro que juan se empeñaba en afirmar que con la jugada ae7 se es más fácil empujar la cadena de peones comenzando por el peón " c ", simple cuestión de gustos. hasta aquí la apertura fué jugada perfectamente por ambos jugadores, en la jugada propuesta por las negras no recordé la continuación más fuerte para mi gusto según la linea que era f5 , según mi base de datos de hecho f6 fué una novedad que para sorpresa mia tambien es buena y da igualdad a las negras. por ejemplo , 14 .- cxe4- dxe4  15.-de2-ag4   16.-dxg4-axd4   17.-tfe1 - fxe5  18.-fxe5 - dd5   19. tad1-axe3+   20.-txe3 - dxe5    =(0.07) rybka 3 (no soy muy amigo de los analisis con computadora pero crei que la posición critica así lo ameritaba) igualdad por todos lados, el peon doblado en c de las negras no se verá muy lindo pero tienen las mismas oportunidades de defenderlo como las blancas de atacarlo, se puede decir que es un punto debil en forma de espejismo. la jugada ingenua de las negras pierde automaticamente, mucho mejor era  19.- txf1 - axe3+  20.-dxe3- dxd7  21.-dxe4-h6  22.-b3-te8   23.-df4 - dd5  con mucho juego aún el golpe de las blancas no tarda en llegar ya que era una jugada evidente que esclarece la mala disposición del alfil negro. es raro pero durante dos partidas consecutivas me ocurrio lo que con mis amigos de blitz denominamos como " delirium tremens"  poco frecuente en este tipo de partidas. primero con sebastian urquiola con quien perdí en solo 9 jugadas si no mal recuerdo,  pero me sirvió de lección para estar más atento y separar problemas externos con los problemas dentro de las 64 casillas.  
-------------------------------------
típica linea escocesa interesante planteamiento de ignacio, g3 es una fuerte jugada pero no de las más usuales en espe tipo de posiciones, lo bueno de la jugada g3 es que el negro debe jugar muy preciso debido a que las blancas  mantienen ardua presión en el punto e4-d5  y cualquier error del bando negro significa instantaneamente ceder la ventaja a las blancas. las negras con d5 intentan sacar del esquema a las blancas con un golpe tampoco muy usual en este momento al mismo tiempo que se intenta explorar la diagonal por la cual las blancas quieren lograr ventaja,  más habitual para las negras aqui es 7...h5, 7.....cxd4,  7....0-0  aquí a ignacio le falto más apertura y logica, debió tomar 10.- cxd4 - ab6   ya que el ae3 cubre muy bien el peon d4 y no hace notoria la debilidad de la isla que tiene en dicho punto.  la lógica negra es simple, si se cambian las damas ese final supondría un final poco peligroso y mucho más simple ganar debido a la debilidad en d4 mala jugada por parte de las blancas, el cambio solo le conducira a complicaciones, era necesario evitar e cambio jugando da3 ya se nota la falta de apoyo de la dama blanca me pareció un golpe interesante debido a que si las blancas toman 17.-fxe3- cc2  18.- tac1 - cxe3  19.- td4-cxg2  20.-rxg2-the8  y al eliminar el alfil de g2 se explota aun más la debilidad en d4, aquí hay ventaja negra en mi opinión la jugada a3 deja en posición critica a las blancas, ignacio debió entrar en la linea ya mencionada, con a3 dejan de oponer resistencia. la jugada d6 es mala, pero tiene su gracia, ignacio debio ver el punto b7 con rayos x debido a que el caballo esta en b2 pero era cosa de calcular 4 o 5 jugadas para darse cuenta de que era completamente defendible, fue un regalo injustificado. aunque debo admitir que estuve pensando unos 15 minutos jajaja.  hay ventaja decisiva  por parte negra  la jugada blanca no ayuda en nada, a pesar de estar perdidas si quieren seguir jugando quiza un intento mejor hubiese sido ta1 creo que en esta partida recupere el nivel que debi mostrar en el torneo, pero con tan pocas rondas (4) tomando en cuenta que era la tercera ya era demasiado tarde. 
-------------------------------------
aquí ya me sentí mejor, pero temía el avance del peón b5-b4, por lo que hice una novedad horrible, cuando tenía que jugar 17.bd3 sin problema. ahora el plan negro es largo pero realizable: mover el caballo por g7-f5 seguido por af8 para luego ubicar el caballo en e7 y dominar la casilla c6. aquí era necesario devolver la dama, bien sea b3 o d2, demostrando que moverla hacia b4 resultó inútil. aquí era tomar 23.dxc6 y no temer a la intermedia ...d5? ya que sigue 24.qb3 dxe4 25.re7! y la dama y la torre quedan atacando la casilla f7, muy difícil de defender para las negras. desafortunadamente, no la calculé y a partir de aquí comencé a perder. quizás era mejor 27.h5 directo. unas jugadas después las blancas se rindieron, por la llegada de los peones f y g.

benoni - thematic game. main line the most agressive line. the best move is supposed to be n. black perfectly  knows it but wants to try something else. not at all considered as the best move but white also want to experiment. logical black cannot take back to  prevent re8 pinning the knight. black counters 12. d3 is another candidate move but 12. .. re8 would have been anoying to devellop and attack the d pawn.  white cannot  protect the d pawn, 9. e5 was definitely a mistake,  so that 13. h3 to prevent 13. ... bg4 or 13. ... ng4 taking the poor isolated white pawn (and settling a knight on he center). black has a material advantage and his position is better. things are going bad for white. defense first and preparing a counter attack as soon as possible. of course black carries on attacking  "music..." werstern movie  : the two champs face each other... "music again" a rider comes around to link the a rook and the queen  black takes. black is now 2 pawns ahead but his pièces are not develops so that white's plan is to attack quickly. counter attack but with 2 pawns late, white has a bad game, not to speak of the 2 black bishops white's pla is to attack f7 with all th available material and obtain a good trading sequence. the black raider goes back in his lair aiming at f7 attacking and advancing the pawns black will have to play a defensive move f7 is still the goal to menace 25. nf7 rxf7 26. re8+  rf8 27. qxf8+ mate black sees the danger and plays the proper move now white has little choice, for there is no  good place for the lsb. so that i initiate a trading sequence at least the black king is weakened but white is still two points late in material. minority attack. if 27. ...  bxa4 28.qxa4 and black has 2 isolated pawns  mate menace only move menacing the queen, black is on attack again still covering the a5 e1 diagonal to prepare 30. ... bf3 protection move. black's attack is getting dangerous this move is less effective than it first seems because white is not forced to take with the f pawn, so that setting the rook on the open file to prepare a counter attack the main danger is not the attack on f3 but the pawns on the queenside one less. white takes the initiative again two more squares but white has still heavy material.  menacing the queen which has little good spots to go material equality. black's c pawn is only two squares away from promotion but white has a frk attack between the 2 bishops now white has material advantage. the only problem is the c pawn (but it's a big problem) very good move. white is in serious touble for i cannot prevent black to play c2. the sacrifice of the black knight was a good one. the only possible move, i believe. if black plays anything else than 37. ... c2, white has a possible counterattack by rd1 etc... if black plays c2, white has still a possibility, which is... black plays c2 draw  because white can give perpetual check.

this game starts as a wild king's gambit. after some fascinating tactics in the early mid-game, the game settles down into a level position, and eventually a level pawn ending. but just when my colorful opponent has a draw within his sights, he blunders and then there is no way back. enjoy! so i copy his move he opts for the king's gambit. "white offers a pawn to divert the black e-pawn so as to build a strong centre with d2–d4. theory has shown that in order for black to maintain the gambit pawn, he may well be forced to weaken his kingside. the king's gambit is one of the oldest documented openings, as it was examined by the 17th century italian chess player giulio polerio. it is also in an older book by luis ramirez de lucena."
-------------------------------------
usually i play the dutch against the english (i sometimes play e5, c6 etc. and play the white side of the c3 sicilian), but, because i've been in a hypermodern phase, i thought i'd try for a king's indian my opponent obliges, and steers me toward the main line. many book lines play e4 here - i favor e3 because it's less of a commitment - no sé cual mueve es mejor aqui pero personalmente yo prefiero e3 por que e3 me ayuda defender mí campo ahora y luego podimos romper con f4. this is where i depart from main line theory by playing c5. up to this point, database is showing thousands of games that went exactly this way. for future reference, theory prefers e5 here. playing for f5 here - pushing the f pawn feels like winning! !  this move creates an outpost on g3 which proves to be a formidable infiltration square. the main criticism of nf6 and nf3 openings (both of which i play regularly) is that they sometimes have serious issues creating space - as we will see later, this particular game is won and lost entirely based on the space i was able to create here.  ?  no sé por que esta mueva estuvo jugado - obviamente estoy controlando b4 ahora y no pienso que c1 es mejor que d1 por este caballo....de todos modos no tan mejor que tu necesitas usar un tiempo ?  this was a mistake which cost me a pawn - it worked out for me, but i think this might have been my undoing against a better player (and that is, of course, no insult to ahmed who plays at least as well as i do) !  and here we are - the invasion square! pick an outpost and use it well, ali babe! i have my eye on the g and h files - this move prepares my major pieces to claim them! the knight returns to the square it left many moves ago...que triste for better or worse, i tend to work very slowly when trying to expand a slight advantage, and everything has been leading to this position.  the h and g files are mine (though h needs unblocking...) - my knight is pointed at the outpost - my bishop is pointed at the king and queen - and my king is underneath a massive pawn blob with few immediate lanes of attack.   the d7 bishop, sadly, has no part in this game (and never does) ?  there's a very good chance that this is a mistake. by move 36, i was eager to get my advantage and win with it - hasty and greedy...particularly for my style. bg5 or qh5 were pefectly adequate here.  my opponent clearly thinks he has a defensible position here and starts moving the king back and forth....this definitely helped me get into place for an unstoppable attack.  ?  it's too late to do something active now - i think it's time to defend the king! ???  this is just poor calculation. the game could have gone on for another 20 moves...white is still a pawn up, so if the material is traded down to nothing, i am theoretically on the losing side.   still, i am well placed, if i may say so - the bishop is using the outpost i created 28 moves ago- the rook owns the g file - the queen owns the h file - and even the poor little d7 bishop (who, only moved once in a 46 move game) is doing his part to block the mean lady from squeezing out some kind of draw.  ?  grabbing pawns is not priority a right now! the bishop cannot be taken - i've calculated it to forced mate in every line there. a very pretty infiltration that worked a treat, if i may say so. 
-------------------------------------
i played italian becaue i don´t like the 2 knight opening (3. ..nf6) i took the pown the players in my chessclub said be7 was better nf6 mayby better? he looked to f7 that was my great mitake. after thi move the desaster began. i think qe7 was better  
-------------------------------------
parecia un inicio con defensa siciliana, bonito el encuentro de esos dos peones de costado...jajaja preparaba la salida de mi alfil para que presione en la diagonal y pudiera hacer el enroque de rey hasta aqui todo parece normal. y entonces tomó el caballo. algunos jugadores piensan que el caballo es una pieza dificil de predecir asi que deciden eliminarlos por que los "odian", jajaja. y daño su enroque pues el alfil defiende bien al rey de ese mismo lado. penso seguramente dañar mi linea de peones del lado de la dama. tomo el peon libre y debio luego regresar pero el jugador era demasiado agresivo y algo impetuoso ahora comio al otro caballo, supogno que siguiendo con la linea de devorar a los dos caballos lo mas pronto posible, jajaja. (mis pobres caballitos). avanza sus peones sin poner a resguardo a su rey. comienzo a limpiar el centro y tratando de no tener esos dos peones juntos. los del alfil de la dama.  ya. ahora puedo respirar, y empezar a proyectarme hacia el fondo del tablero a coronar... aqui con sacar el caballo se acababa el problema pero el queria seguir teniendo la iniciativa y ahora perseguia a mi dama. quiso el cambio ahora por el alfil.  e7-e6???. esa si que fue la jugada que me permitio ganar. supongo que no medito mucho antes de hacerla.  tenia que avanzar mi alfil, y capturar el peon d5 pues su peon e6 estaba "clavado" por la torre y no podia moverse hacia la diagonal.  20 ....,00 ????  ya era desesperacion y no deporte. recien decide hacer el enroque y lo hizo poniendo a su rey en a linea de un alfil y teniendo un peon defendido por una sola pieza y atacado por dos.  y no se dio cuenta que al capturar el peon su reyna quedaba expuesta y sin defensa.  el resto es ya jugar tranquilo y esperar.  24 ....,bxc2?. aqui si queria hacer algo tenia que avanzar el peon g6-g5.. aunque la verdad es que la partida ya estaba perdida... el tenia la esperanza de que yo tomara el alfil???..  
-------------------------------------
de nuevo ataque al peon debil f7. yo en total desarrollo y el oponente aun en pañales, jejeje vamos a destruir ese enroque!!!! necesitaba liberar mi reyna. jaque a la reyna..... y el no se dio cuenta al parecer.... aqui si comia a la reyna perdia a la torre y mi ataque acababa y era muy bueno al lado del rey. aun a pesar de todo seguia el compañero sin darse cuenta de que su reyna estaba en peligro, o quizas cosidero mas importante el ataque de mis torres. aunque al parecer queria atacar a mi peon de la torre a5. ahora el planeaba un ataque sobre mi caballo. pero aun si penetraba con la reyna en h8 mi rey huia a f8 pues mi hermoso alfil del rey estaba alli al lado cubriendo las celdas negras. me trague su caballo me regalo el mate.

king's knight opening (c40)  ut ur öppningsboken. 2...nc6 är vanligast med 46-39 till vit. +1,10 och ett bra utgångsläge om jag hade slagit nxe5 +0,63 och svarts bästa drag är exd5. +0,94 och bäst hade varit att slå med nxe5, men jag ville säkra centern genom att avancera d-bonden. +0,24 och svart kan lätt koppla grepp genom att pinna med bb4.  +0,57 och bäst för svart hade varit att pinna med 5...bb4. +0,30 och jag förbereder rockad. +0,52 och jag hade varit mer strategisk om jag planerat att pinna svarts s på f6. +0,31 och här gör svart bäst i att slå dxc6. +5,51 och svart hänger sin l. +5,76 och jag blockerar även svarts rockad. +7,87 och jag vill rensa upp i centern. ser att min d kan lösa uppgiften. +7,05 och min d är urstark i sitt centrala läge. +9,20 och svarts s och l hänger löst. +9,41 och svart borde hejda min d genom ex.vis en utväxling. +9,42 och min d kan fortsätta att rensa bort material för svart. +9,43 och läget är lugnt nog för att göra rockad snart +10,39 och jag funderar på att mobilisera min mörka l på ett lämpligt sätt. +9,46 och jag har två diagonaler att välja på. +12,96 och samtliga drag är till min fördel. +14,42 och det bästa draget i den här positionen. stärker offensiven mot svarts k och han riskerar en löpargaffel på e7. +29,04 och jag hade lätt kunnat tvinga tillbaka svarts k till f8 genom att spela bc4+, för att sedan gaffla hans d. men jag vill få fart på mina torn i det här läget. +17,61 och jag är redo att påbörja avslutet på partit. +25,66 och jag har några alternativ. det ser trångt ut nere i svarts kungsbo och jag ser att man kan pressa ner hans k till bakre raden. idel mattlägen, och jag väntar mig d5 eller nd5 som parering från svart. +matt i 2, men jag observerade inte läget fullt så noggrant. min l på a3 pinnar svarts s och det hade kunnat utnyttjas med qd5 och sedan matt på f7. det här ger snart en nådastöt det också. matt i 20 drag är inget dumt resultat.

a very good game by ancientart i'd like to show. i always liked this opening... but ancientart will teach me a lesson about it this was a guess... was not a good one... this was the idea. maybe qxd3, rxf3, gxh5 was better. i am not sure. yes that was perfect. i saw it, but though and i didn't expect that one and this is a terrible mistake... because of this... i should have played 15. ne4 one step to mate... one step to mate not any more of course not bh6, lose the horse and that's all folks forced to defend oh my kaïssa! what a mistake and now it is all over... maybe better was kc3, but... whatever good game, ancientart

-------------------------------------
the comment below is a prequil to this.  we'll now do it like a game and start the chat.  bhidragon: ok, let's start.  thinking about the sicilian from black's point of view, what is the purpose of the opening? in other words, what advantages does the sicilian bring to black? how should black use these advantages in the game?  forget memorizing moves, start understanding the dynamics of the opening.  when you've answered the questions (nothing fancy, just the basics) we'll start a najdorf and take it from there.  thewrongreason: i agree, so what i had to do was with the practice board. and, the simple part was just the first 2 moves from black. when, i just those, after 2...d6, the bc8 has a lot of mobility. in fact, i think about how many squares they cover because easy19 once emphasized it. and, a lot of times, when the b is first developed, they cover some squares. i believe the most is 2, but when the sicilian is played, the b covers 5 squares which gives it a ton of mobility. mobility is an important factor, and as far as, how to use it, i haven't done it before.  so, now my thinking is coming on because there's something i really like which i, previously, did not even consider. it has to do with later pinning the nf3, with ...bg4 now, that way might be premature, but someonelse once rightly noted not to tie down your own pieces. and, even in an indirect pin that's easy to break, the n would still be tied down to the b. i just don't know how much merit that adds or if this way of thinking is premature since i've gone wrong that way. but, what i like the most is that when the sicilian is first played, the lsb has a lot of options, more then i once realized.  bhidragon: let’s continue with a different approach.  the sicilian “works” well for a couple of reasons.  first, black can often prevent white from building a “big center” with pawns on e4 and d4. that’s what 1 ... c5 is all about, to kill the possibility of white playing d4 and keeping the pawn there. that can become a significant advantage in the middle-game, since black has an easier time keeping his e and d pawns in play.  second, in many sicilian systems black has a half-open c-file which greatly speeds up his attack against white’s queen-side, an attack which black needs to get going pretty quick.  third, white usually gains a space advantage in the early opening and black needs to equalize by expanding, normally on the queen-side.  fourth, and the background to all sicilian games, is that this is a very non-symmetrical and dynamic family of openings. speed is absolutely critical for both sides. speed, speed, speed! anything can happen, and every mistake is there waiting to be made.  was that helpful?  i’m sending a challenge, you get to play the black side of the najdorf. thewrongreason: that definitely was. and, some of what went into that part was difficult, but to make it easier, i'll start an annotation that just won't be made public. when this entire game is finished, then it'll be public and the complete annotation. as this is the kind of thing that susan wants to see. bhidragon: see, starting to understand the basics of an opening is much, much more important than memorizing a list of moves.  that was by no means the complete theory of the sicilian of course, just enough to get us going. thewrongreason: that definitely was. and, some of what went into that part was difficult, but to make it easier, i'll start an annotation that just won't be made public. when this entire game is finished, then it'll be public and the complete annotation. as this is the kind of thing that susan wants to see. bhidragon: so, why should black play 3. ... cxd4 in our game position?  thewrongreason: i wondered that to. but, the reason is because if white allows 3.dxc5, white either has to lose a pawn. or, if black recaptures with 3...dxc5, white exchanges with 4.qxd8+ and takes away blacks right to castle.  bhidragon: true to some extent.  but, think about the fundamental concepts behind the sicilian we talked about a couple of days ago.  remember?  1. prevent white from putting pawns on e4 and d4 (the big center)  2. open attacking lines on the queen-side  3. aggression and speed  so then, black must play 3. ... cxd4. absolutely must make that move. why?  it takes white’s d-pawn off the board. concept 1 instantly satisfied.  it opens the c-file as an attacking line for black’s a8 rook. concept 2 satisfied.  you must always come back to the first concepts of any opening system you play to help guide your opening play.  thewrongreason: that's something that i didn't realize, but it makes sense.  it's going back and reviewing where that concept applies.  thewrongreason: what i now have here is what jack made me memorize. but, he didn't mention anything else after this position from the first 6 moves. i guess i still base it on concepts, but i'm sure that there's a lot more to the nadjorf then just this.  bhidragon: there is indeed much more to the najdorf than this, lol.  i’m going to try to develop a concept here that is simply something i’ve come to realize over the years, and it all boils down to this: how do you rationalize the move 5. ... a6 in the sicilian najdorf.  truth be told, my computer melted down two days ago (thanks for the crappy update microsoft) and i’m having to type on my ipad, which i absolutely hate to do.  so, if it’s ok with you i’m going to hold that discussion till my new desktop gets delivered.  i’ll slow down the play of this game a bit (within the 3-day time limit of course), so we don’t have to make too many “not discussed” moves.  thewrongreason: that's fine. there is one question, when you ask about rationalizing, do you mean, why is it played? or is it, about what concept goes into it?  bhidragon: by rationalize i mean how can you argue that this is a good move.  so, i think both of your definitions are somewhat accurate  thewrongreason: makes perfect sense. what i like about 5...a6 is that it prevents 6.nb5 (which i wouldn't be too worried about) or 6.bb5+. but, i would not want to be placed in check there, even if it's a mere nuisance. and, the reason why is because even if i don't move my k where i'd be able to castle, one of the pieces would be directly pinned. even if the pin isn't of concern, i don't enjoy having my pieces tied down like that. 5...a6 puts a stop to that.  bhidragon: avoiding the pin is one of the major reasons for a6. others are more subtle. thewrongreason: i'm not sure what to play against you here. i was thinking in terms of 7...h6 to force your bg5 back. but, that way of thinking isn't all that much better then when i did unsound aggression a few years back, as you remember. my concern is that you would, instead, exchange one of my n for your b. and, my thing is not exchanging, unless it's absolutely necessary to do so. i'm also thinking in terms of fianchettoing one of my b's. but, if so, i'm not sure which one as i like nice long diagonals. and, i'd normally just fianchetto my dsb so that i could castle short. but, i'm worried that my k side might be crammed up. so, the other candidate is to do it q side. as i'm thinking in terms of attacking your e4 pawn again, but it's well defended by your q. so, i'm just not sure where to go from here. the real question is what should i do? with how complex the game is, i just want to be sure that i'm thinking along the right lines. that's especially since i just lost my last game and overlooked a very basic checkmate threat against simon by thinking along the wrong lines.  bhidragon: well, h6 is first in the theory tree. would white really trade bishop for knight without the possibility of messing up black's k-side pawn structure? that's the beauty of black's knight on d7. if white plays bxf6 then black plays nxf6 and white gives up the boshop pair and black keeps the pawns intact. next, g6 is playable, but that turns into a najdorf/dragon hybrid which i've played before but seems a little slow for a sicilian. maybe e6 or e5 would be a better choice to free the dsb. and those two e-pawn moves also support black's central superiority. a last thought is b5. black will play that anyway after white plays 0-0-0, which is typical for this position. would that convince white to play 0-0 instead? black would be able to fianchetto the lsb whatever the case. anyway, those are probably your best shots.  thewrongreason: it is convincing. you mentioned about e6 or e5. i like ...e5 and have played it before because it hits the n. and, i like the idea of freeing the dsb. so, this is what i will play, as there is something that i still have to learn from it. i once played it against charles, but there was some line shortly after that where i went wrong. of course, he's got more experience to. so, i'll have to see where it takes me after the n move and to which square, of course. thewrongreason: i usually ask myself what to do. and, unless it's a mistake, i'm thinking of 8...be7 so that i can castle soon after. my idea of a good time, which isn't always so good, is to castle, asap. but, there is a thread of this koh club, and i was once corrected by nuntar for doing it as he quoted a gm who posted about where it's better to sometimes delay it.  bhidragon: castle early if the queens are still on the board!  with that in mind, move the bishop as you suggested thewrongreason: i'm not so used to seeing the h pawn advance so soon. i'm thinking that you probably played this to get an open file for the r. but, there's a smaller thought process based on our last game. as it's also possible that you might be trying to surround and even attack the k side. i didn't want to play this, but i have a feeling that 10...h6 is necessary to prevent something like 11.h5. as my fear is white being able to play 12.h6, where i feel there would be problems because of something similar that happened in our last game after our blunder. the idea being that the same b was sacked for a devastating attack, and i'm looking into what variations would come in that could be devastating here.  bhidragon: if you remember back to our discussion of the fundamental concepts of the sicilian, we mentioned speed. white is now going to throw a bunch of stuff at the black king to see if anything sticks. bhidragon: ok, so i want to get a little esoteric here, and touch on a way of looking at the game of chess that is new to me. hang with me a little while i touch on the highlights of this way of thinking. let's start by looking at the first moves of the spanish and italian games. 1. e4 e5 i'll make the claim that these moves are understandable to even novices. they grab a piece of the center and open development lines for the bishops. 2. nf3 nc6 attacks and defends, while putting more pressure on the center. this resulting position is understandable! we know what each piece is doing. you can play these moves comfortably, knowing that they make sense and form the basis of a good position. however, let’s take a look at the start of the indian defenses. 1. d4 nf6 2. c4 e6 i’ll claim that these moves are not as intuitively correct as the first couple of moves in the spanish. to the untrained eye, they do not really answer the fundamental requirements of a good opening position. so why play them? we play the first few moves of the indian openings because we understand (have been taught or learned through experience) the pros and cons of the future, evolving positions. rather than looking at a specific position at a specific point in time, we are looking at the potential of the position to evolve along certain paths. let’s look at our najdorf position. white is setting up an attack on the king-side. how should black think about his response? first off, let’s not invent a checklist. let’s just consider things. what are the general objectives for black in the najdorf? control of the center, and attacking chances against white’s queen-side especially using the half-open c-file, and speed. so, your central pawns are probably in good shape. the question you have to answer is who has the advantage in speed? can white’s attack do real damage before black can get a significant attack going. that should guide how you approach the next few moves.  thewrongreason: i like this new way. for me, there was always something different that i just wasn't used to which would take me off guard, and i now realize that it is because of how a position evolves which can be sudden. with that, there's a lot that i didn't realize right here which shows how little i know. as far as, who has the advantage, it's very hard for me to guess. i'm thinking that white has a very small edge because of how things evolved with the a pawn. that would've been easy for me to overlook the attack, but before my last move, my thought process was that if i didn't do something, you could sac your b and get that devastating. with that, i think that white can do quite a bit of damage before black develops an attack. and, i'm thinking about the pawn chain that you now have with your last move. i'm just not quite sure what to do, as i don't have a candidate move to consider yet, in this position. but, i'll really have to give it thought.   bhidragon: so, is white’s attack a real threat or not?  thewrongreason: if i'm to only look at the small stuff, i'd say no. as i can take and exchange pawns. but, the overall picture tells me that it is because you can get your q ready for action. and, then if white takes, you have a similar attack against my monarch.  the real issue is allowing qg2, and i have no idea how to stop it, either.  i'm now thinking that the only thing i can do about the threat you have is to answer with 14...ne7, and then if 15.qg2, 15...hxg5 seems ok for black. but, i think that anything else and black might very well be busted.  bhidragon: i'm not sure i'd consider the question "is white's attack real or not?" to be 'small stuff'. i think it may be central to how you play the next part of the game. well, you do probably need to move the knight somewhere, so do so and let's see how the game progresses from there. thewrongreason: i don't know if i have anything better then taking on g6. i don't want the q swarming in, but then, if i take my k side is destroyed. by how it's playing out, i think that the position is looking very bad for black here.  i meant on h6.  i won't take since i'm starting to see what happens afterwards, and your attack would be devastating. with that, i think ...g6 is required here.  the reason i won't annotate for a while after this is because i was specifically looking at what how to prevent joe from landing his q+r on the g file due to his h6 pawn.  i was thinking about what all of that can do to my monarch based on the overall picture with our last game, in mind. i didn't take now because if i had responded with 23...gxh5 joe could and probably would answer with 24.rg7+  and, after 24...kh8, instead of 25.h7?? right away, he would play 25.qg4.  and, i was thinking 26.h7, which i thought lost but there are ways out of it.  in contrast, 26.qg6 would be curtains since joe would mate, just similar to the last game.  with this move, i thought that everything's fine since my rg8 now protects me from a k side attack.  that is, in contrast to the last game, but what i didn't realize is that i'm not in the clear. ?? joe didn't say anything until now.  but, after this move, he said, "welcome back", and i know from the last game with what it means since he said, "happy birthday" there.  so, all i said was thanks on my next move.  that was, 16 days after i had come back from vacation.  i moved my r over and thought that, now, i was protected from a k side attack and became.   by taking now, i didn't see any immediate danger since i was, in a different context thinking about the big picture.  as with our last game, however, i still missed it because of what's coming.  but, as with before, i was, extremely confident with the move played, and i went overboard, at that.    it wasn't until now that i made me realize that i'm really lost in all variations.  as joe will keep checking, perpetually and not in way that'll end in a draw by rep.  as the position are not going to repeat, so what i'm alluding is that i have no shred of counterplay.     now, the chats are over, so i had three spots to move the monarch.  and, i was trying to figure out where.  other moves, i saw a quick mate, and i saw it here.  but, for me this appeared a little easier to miss a mate, so i was hoping that joe wouldn't play his next move.  my hope was 32.qf1+?? where it's not mate.  but, only a second after this move, i realized that this won't happen since i overlooked that this would allow me to compensate with 32...kxe3 which is how i would've answered.  so, his next move was what predicted since it wins quickly. and, when he plays it, i resigned.  this was in my resignation note, followed by a chess puzzle starting with joe's previous move.  with that, 32...ke1 is forced, and he would've responded to that with 33.qf1# which is mate.  the problem is that i became, as carlsen would call it a, "greedy patzer" and knabbed his r which is how i missed this overall picture.

it is difficult to see why i win. more difficult is to see why i loose. sweet is to win . not to lose. es dificil saber por que motivo uno gana. más difícil es saber por que motivo uno pierde. la derrota nos abruma y nos quita objetividad , hay que tener la humildad de buscar los propios errores.  this bishop is very strong. this bishop will be the fundamental in the victory of the black pieces. my mistake was not doing anything about that bishop. i could have moved the knight to a4.  or my bishop to e3, and instead of thay i change my bishop with the knight.  that is the first mistake. the bishop of the black in the dark squares is very strong. the movement should be bishop e3.  i have a weak point in f4. instead of avoid the occupation with the knight. i am going to commite another mistake.  este es el error. en lugar de evitar que el caballo contrario ocupe la casilla f4 . pongo la dama en una posición que va a ser amenazada por el caballo.  another mistake . to avance that pawn to f4.

come non giocare una scandinava. buona delle bianche.  errore, bisogna avere pazienza ed aspettare a far uscire l'alfiere. meglio sviluppare i cavalli. posizione già difficile.  piano sbagliato, per la debolezza di g2 il gioco è questo: se avanza il pedone, io mi difendo dietro di lui.  certo, non è stato molto simpatico... non temo di scoprire l'arrocco di re, perché mi da la colonna g libera.  ecco qui, adesso vedremo se riesco a sopravvivere.  tanto valeva aver giocato db1 sin da prima. decisione difficile: o-o, f6, df6, o cd7-f6? continua ad ammassare difese dietro il pedone, ma cosí non ottiene niente.  ecco, adesso ho recuperato un pedone, e il suo in 6 è isolato.  rendendosi conto che prima o poi lo perde, il bianco cerca di fare il colpo di scena. lodevole. ma perché non prima te1? pensavo che scambiando le torri mi sarebbe stato più facile prendere, eventualmente, il pedone d6. se ce la faccio, sono a gioco pari.  guarda guarda, non avevo visto che cosí mi blocca lui! errore! carina anche questa. l'avevo vista, e me la sono lasciata fare.  e qui il colpo di scena l'ho fatto io...  vedete? i miei pedoni finiscono col vincere, anche perdendo l'alfiere! bellino, direi, da studio.   
-------------------------------------
a loss of time, probably. the idea is i can play bf4 and then retire it on h2 after nh5, because i don't want to exchange it in my scheme of playing.  now, it works with some black schemes, but not with the one used my opponent in this game. so the move is useless. more specificly, when black plays d5 and e6, my black square bishop has a strong action on the diagonal h2-b8, but he hasn't played those moves yet.  probabilmente una perdita di tempo. l'idea è quella di giocare la mia solita af4 potendo poi ritirare l'alfiere in h2.  still the bishop on f4 prevents e7-e5, so it is not useless in this square.  this move works on schemes where the black's black-squares bishop can act on the f8-h3 diagonal, because it leaves the possibility of c3, creating a strong pawn wall. but this is not the case. still, c3 is a good move for white to block the g8 bishop. but the style of playing is too passive for white.   giocata irriflessivamente. dato che l'alfiere nero è lontano dalla diagonale a3-f8, non è necessario essere così passivi. sarà questo lo sbaglio? after c5xd4, e3xd4 allows white to build, with c3, the block against the g8 bishop. but it leaves the diagonal open to the black's white square bishop in b7 (this happened in this same game). white should have had the ability to reply d5 to this move, so nc3 was needed, no matter the pressure on the black diagonal.  l'idea è sempre quella di costruire la fortezza complementando questa con c3, e poi giocare a spingere i pedoni sul lato di re. ha funzionato molte volte.  against the black scheme, the white bishop is useless in this square. i played it just to avoid black's bf5, but i have lost the initiative already, since i am defending (with white pieces, and in the 7º move!). moreover, the black's white squares bishop has a much better place to go.   i have already "lost" the game, strategically speaking!  forse qui non si vede bene il piano d'attacco del bianco. evidentemente, voglio impedire af5. the only reasonable move here would have been c4, in order to fight for d5! looking for an attack via the h pawn, aiming to h7. but it is a bad idea, because  to build it it takes too much moves.  questa "doppietta" si schanta contro un muro, ma l'idea è, prima o poi, spingere il pedone in h ed eventualmente sacrificare la torre per il cavallo in h5. unaware of my disadvantage, i secure my king on the wrong side, with the idea of getting both my rooks on the h5 diagonal (and even to play h5, and if nxh5, rxn).  proseguendo il mio piano, devo portare l'altra torre in posizione e mettere al sicuro il mio re. evidentemente, il piano è fasullo. normalmente, in questa posizione l'alfiere nero in b7 è bloccato dal mio pedone in d5, ma qui non l'ho portato. e adesso la gran diagonale soffre. ho già quasi perso.  but the black tempo advantage is clear. he comes first to attack. c4 gets my white squares' bishop away of the desired diagonal, so i had to look for another way to use it. having changed my plan, i should have taken some initiative by playing qa4, taking it away form the weak c column. it is not a good plan, but better than the one i choosed.  altro piano fasullo, scambiare l'alfiere bianco. dovevo giocare da4, approfittando che non poteva subito fare a6.  now i am helpless on the queen side.   anche qua ho considerato da4, ma adesso sí che poteva rispondere bene con a6. probabilmente, questa mossa è più tematica di quanto pensavo.  piano fasullo, perché comunque non posso spingere il pedone in e4 per c5xd4. disperatamente, ho cercato qualche sbocco. "devo" perdere tempo per consolidare la mia posizione, quando l'attacco del nero diventa inarrestabile.  cerco di scambiare pezzi per smorzare la situazione, ma non ci riesco. ho voluto sbloccare il mio cavallo... this was a move that took a lot of thinking. i made up a plan to exchange pieces and take time in order to counterplay. i was calculating that he cannot play the fork e7-e5, because of nxb5, etc. but he replied with another move i didn't see, that leaves me resourceless.  questa mossa è epica. ho perso moltissimo tempo a calcolare e7-e5, e ho visto che riuscivo a sopravvivere decentemente. immaginiamoci il rischio... e i miei calcoli sono stati buoni! infatti, non ha risposto e7-e5. ma quello che non ho visto è stata la semplice... e adesso sì che minaccia e7-e5. e io, cos'ho ottenuto? questo l'insegnamento (oltre all'apertura). triste, ma non sono riuscito a vederne una migliore.  cambiare le donne, anche a costo di un pedone raddoppiato, con l'idea di spingerlo, eventualmente, in e5, anche perdendolo, pur di accecare l'alfiere nero.  ormai sono perduto. se b2xc3, scopro il re, e con gli scacchi di torre e l'alfiere bianco... però, avrei resistito comunque meglio. non guardiamo, per favore, la seguente mia mossa, perché mi vergogno.  e qui non mi sono arreso per il pezzo di meno, ma perché comunque non avevo sbocchi né speranze di fronte all'attività dei pezzi neri.  
-------------------------------------
my usual.  sensible answer.  surprising move number one of the budapest. instead of retaking, black poses white a little dilemma.  white chooses the so-called wisest answer: ignore the pawn and develop.  this is the icelandic. black, instead of retake the pawn, sacrifices one instead, for a quick developement.  white doesn't take the bite. here, a lot of little tactics can be performed by white starting with bb5+, and after black blocks the check, dxe6 forces black to open the f column.  after nxd5, c4 is strong and makes white win a tempo.  instead of c4. this knight is dangerous on b5 in some circunstances.  here, black has some material to work with: ne4 is now possible, and qe7+ supports the bishop and controls the e column. nevertheless, black has to be very careful about his dsb's future.  white returns the compliment.  this move kind of delays my developement, but it opens the way for my dsb to c7, guards b5 from b or n, frees my nf6 from the defence of d6 (once nf3 is unpinned)...  white takes the initiative, returning me my own plan. no panic.  this bishop can be attackable by: the f pawn (no, because it is blocked), nc5 or nf4 (none of them is likely to reach those squares any soon, or white's lsb, after h4 and bh3. i have plenty of time to act before that.  white unpins his knight, preventing my ne4.  i made a clumpsy attempt to move the game on. i knew i left a hole in b5, but after qb5+, i would have to choose among qd7, and the more intriguing nf-d7, since after qxb7, ndb6 blocks the white queen very badly.  of course not bxc5, since after qb5+ i'll lose the bishop.  i considered here qa5 to be a good move.   some lines i explored:  9.	...		qa5. if white goes  10.	nb5		bxd2+ 11.	qxbd2	qd2+ and here, white must think about how to retake, since 12.	nxd2		kd7, and black has compensation for the pawn, and is about to press hard on white's n and pawn. on the other side, if 12.	kxd2, trying to save a tempo for castling,  12.			ne4+, forcing white to defend f2 with the king, and threatening c5.   again, after kd7 and a6, black's asset improves drastically. for example: 13.	ke3		kd7 14.	b4		a6 15.	nd4		nc6 etc, with a decent game.   or: 9.	...		qa5 10.	nd4!		kd7, with a lot of ways for white to proceed.   other possible black moves are:  qe7 (10. qb5+, qd7...) nc6 d4!? (10. ne4 looks good, because it defends c5 and if... 10. ..., nxn 11. qxn, and black is free to play bxc5, since after 12. qxb7?, bd4, 13. qb5+, nd7, 14. ne5?, qe7... now i would have played another one. i just did not see all.  the position is already very complicated, with possible tactics melées like this one:   exchange queen or not to exchange?  sac or not the b2 pawn.   10.	e2-b5+	e6-d7 11.	f3-e5	b4-c3 12.	e5-d7	c3-d2+ 13.	e1-d1	a5-b5 14.	d7-f6+	g7-f6 15.	f1-b5+	b8-c6 16.	d1-d2	  or this 10.	e2-b5+	a5-b5 11.	c3-b5	b4-d2+ 12.	f3-d2	e8-d7 13.	b5-d6	d7-c6 14.	d2-b3	a7-a6 15.	b3-d4+	c6-c5 16.	d4-e6+	f7-e6 17.	d6-b7+	c5-c6 18.	b7-a5+	c6-b6 19.	b2-b4	b8-c6 20.	a5-c6	b6-c6  or   10.	e2-b5+	b8-d7 11.	b5-b7	a8-b8 12.	b7-a6	a5-a6 13.	f1-a6	d7-c5 14.	c3-b5	c5-a6 15.	d2-b4	a6-b4 16.	b5-c7+	e8-d7 17.	c7-e6	b4-c2+ 18.	e1-d2	c2-a1 19.	e6-c5+	d7-c6 20.	c5-d3	f6-e4+ 21.	d2-e2	h8-e8 22.	h1-a1	e4-c5+ 23.	e2-d2	c5-d3 24.	d2-d3	b8-b2  and the one i like most:   10.	e2-b5+	b8-d7 11.	b5-b7	a8-b8 12.	b7-c6	a5-c5 13.	c6-a6	f6-e4 14.	c3-e4	d5-e4 15.	d2-b4	b8-b4 16.	f3-d2	e4-e3 17.	d2-b3	 i went for this one, after a lot of complex lines, full of tricks, tactics of all kind. a melée. strangely enough, despite the hole on the white diagonal, black seems to find compensation for b7 if white takes.   with cold mind, i can see that nc6 was much better. this one was in the hope that white would take b7.  i actually wanted to provoke white to get into c6.  my reasoning must have been right. white didn't want to play my game, and went for simplification. i don't know if he wants to exploit nb5, but this allows bxb+, and either ways white takes it,  black can shield and even treat something on the e column, one castled.  practically forced. white went for the simplification, being right to losen the tension.  ok, i could castle and i am threatening c5. not much for a pawn.  nice way to protect the pawn, and tempting me to play bxn in order to recover c5. i didn't want to lose my bishop's pair, but this was the useless bishop's pair i could have seen ever.  thank you white. now my bishop's pair will gain in strenght. but this allows white to give the perfect structure to his pawns, and the game is too "cold" for me to get something from the position. i sacrificed a pawn for nothing, essentially. this happens to me when playing the icelandic in a serious game.  no use in threatening the pawn abandoning the guard of d5. from now on, the game is just useless.  white can play b4 whenever he wants.  bc7 would have been wiser, but i waited to b4.  18.	e1-e8+	a8-e8 19.	a3-a4	b7-b5 20.	a4-b5	a6-b5 21.	a1-a6	e8-e6 22.	a6-a7	e6-c6 23.	f3-e5	c7-e5 24.	c3-d5	f6-d5 25.	a7-d7	d5-f6 26.	d7-e7	e5-c7 27.	d2-c3	f6-d5 28.	e7-e8+	g8-h7 29.	c3-d2	c6-a6 30.	e8-e1	a6-a4 31.	c2-c3	a4-a2 32.	e1-d1	c7-e5  i was trying here to block the huge white majority, hoping that the c pawn, alone, wouldn't have advanced very soon. but later... 20.	h2-h3	a6-a5 21.	e1-e8+	d7-e8 22.	f3-d4	a5-b4 23.	a3-b4	f6-e4 24.	c3-d5	c7-e5 25.	c5-c6	e4-d2 26.	c6-c7	e8-d7 27.	d5-e7+	g8-f8 28.	c7-c8+	d7-c8 29.	e7-c8	e5-d4  because the other way to proceed doesn't work:  20.	h2-h3	d7-f5 21.	e1-e8+	f6-e8 22.	c3-d5	f5-c2 23.	d5-c7	e8-c7  finally, i discovered an "innocent" move that can be a very important "finesse". black apparently loses a tempo, but it is not clear for white how to attack.  assuming i am not overlooking some attack from white, this move actually reinforces my d5 pawn. because:  1) it allows my rook to move, by covering e7.  2) it allows my king to retake the rook in case it is exchanged by white. otherwise, i must do it with my lsb, because my knight is dued to the defence of d5. this makes me lose a lot of tempoes. without rooks on the board, my king is better placed near to the action, and, moreover... 3) it allows my lsb to move to f5, from where it threats heavily c2, not easy to defend.  i assume white would try to attack with the g pawn (g4, g5), but i am confident i'll be able to handle that with my own threats.  23.	c5-c6	e5-d4 24.	c6-d7+	e8-d7  trying to make some use of my bishops. i am welcoming c6... bringing my king into the defence of the c column, overlooking... i can go bc7, and i have no idea if this could have been better.  the weakness of d5 crushes me. that's all the story! freeing my knight. i accept bxn. normal.  last attempt: to create some unbalance and a free pawn. but useless.  aiming to h3, and trying to separate his pawn.  i expected this... ...controlling c6.  30.	g1-f2	d8-c7 31.	f2-g3	c7-c6 32.	g4-h5	d7-f5 33.	g3-f4	f5-h7 34.	f4-g5	e4-e3 35.	g7-c3	f7-f5 36.	g5-h6	f5-f4 37.	h6-h7	f4-f3 38.	h7-g6	f3-f2 39.	h5-h6	  but...  30.	g1-f2	d8-e7 31.	f5-f6+	e7-e6 32.	g4-h5	e6-f5 33.	h5-h6	f5-g6 34.	h3-h4	d7-g4 35.	f2-g3	g4-e2 36.	g3-f4	e2-f3 37.	c5-c6	  it doesn't look good even in this way:  30.	g1-f2	d8-e7 31.	f5-f6+	e7-e6 32.	g4-h5	e6-d5 33.	h5-h6	d7-f5 34.	f2-e3	d5-c6 35.	e3-d4	c6-c7 36.	g7-f8	c7-c6 37.	f8-d6	f5-h7 38.	c2-c4  nor this:   30.	g1-f2	d8-e7 31.	f2-e3	f7-f6 32.	e3-e4	d7-c6+ 33.	e4-e3	c6-g2 34.	g4-h5	g2-h3 35.	e3-f4	h3-g2 36.	h5-h6	e7-f7 37.	f4-e3	g2-d5 38.	e3-d4	d5-a2 39.	c2-c4	b5-c4 40.	c5-c6	c4-c3 41.	d4-c3	a2-b1 42.	a3-a4	b1-f5 43.	b4-b5	a6-b5 44.	a4-b5  careful with... 30.	g1-f2	h5-g4 31.	h3-g4	d8-e7 32.	g7-h6	e7-f6 33.	f2-e3	d7-c6 34.	e3-f4	c6-d5 35.	g4-g5+	f6-e7 36.	f5-f6+	e7-e6 37.	g5-g6	f7-g6 38.	h6-g5	e6-f7 39.	f4-e5	d5-b7 40.	e5-d6	 no use in delaying more this move. my bishop will have to defend e4, so no counterplay on the h3 pawn.  it was very nice to dream on f6, from where my king can take a round and block the g pawn.  as foreseen. white has to do a little work to win.  no other interesting moves i can see.  ! the winning move.  no hope at all.  ? the blunder. i should have gone kf8, to occupy g8 with the king. but white then will win with the queenside pawns.   
-------------------------------------
a lot of theory was written about this kind of game. i don't know it as i should, but it is normal to think about 6. nxf7 first. if the king takes the knight, qf3+ recovers the piece. if you play something like qf6, 7. bxnd5, and i think it is worse for black.  black should think about something like 5. ..., na5.  a very tactic position. i don't play it because if i want to, i know i have to read a lot. probably better for white bxn, leaving black's pawns doubled and isolated (with or without the queens). pure adrenalyne.  same as before. i don't see what other advantage can white have from the position.  or qb3, to press on b7 and/or f7. if black answers na5, q+, and it is the same story - getting a doubled + isolated pawn. black has considered bb4, for sure... would the queen chasing lead to somewhere? :-). maybe just some developement.  too late. white sees qe4+, since after it the queen can take g7 or c7, but... smart, but it kind of demostrates bd7 was a waste of time.  of course. losing a piece, since white has a check. better would have been the "quiet" bb6. white would have had a nice attack, here.  a piece is lost. nevertheless, black has some compensation, and now it is his turn to attack.  isn't white seeing qxc2, threating qxd2+? horrible, being possible to play bc3. hmmm... with the couple of white's inaccuracies, the black position starts to be very interesting. white realizes he cannot take the pawn: fxe3, rxe3+ and white cannot take it back because of rd1#.  interesting is e2, 22. re1, qd1, 23. bb2, but fails because now black cannot play rxd2 due to qxe7+... and the piece is back, with advantage... just a pawn, and the position is open. incredibly, the storm vanished but black can be proud ;-) i think that black must have tried to get the 2º row.  in case he wants to throw its pawns, c5... but it is not really relevant. still... black must react to the c2 threat, here... maybe he thinks that it leads nowhere, and just wants to simplify (the best way to win, here). so, probably this move is a way of tempting him. but qxc7+, then simply retreat, is just a plain pawn loss.  and white loses his chances to recover the pawn.  ...and now he loses another one. he can recover it, but on the wrong side... black's pawns are equal to a rook, in value... it is difficult to see the followings. by now, the game is even, since the distance to promotion is the same for both pawns! can white support this pawn? can white support this pawn? has he another choice? not with this move. with kg2, qa2+ would be answered with qf2, and black... is lost, i think! funny, isn't it? black must be careful with a perpetual trap. qf1+, kh2, a2 doesn't work because qa3+... a pity. it would have been a good lesson for black to go on until the win. overall well played, thoug.   
-------------------------------------
las aperturas de peón de rey abren enseguida las diagonales del alfil blanco y de la dama, lo que suele dar lugar a partidas agresivas desde el principio. por el contrario, la jugada 1.d4 hace que la apertura sea mucho más tranquila, al tener menos flexibilidad para sacar piezas, al tiempo que lleva a posiciones más sólidas, sobre todo debido a la función defensiva que adquiere la dama.      es la respuesta clásica, que da lugar a aperturas tan tradicionales como la española, la italiana o la escocesa.      tenía ganas de experimentar con la apertura del alfil, que nunca he llevado a cabo en partidas serias. la apertura del alfil era muy jugada en tiempos antiguos, pero luego fue perdiendo popularidad. sin embargo, en los últimos años ha vuelto a ponerse de moda. al sacar el alfil a c4, se presiona el centro y el peón más débil de las negras, que es el f7, al tiempo que se controla la diagonal a2-g8.      una jugada muy natural. evita que el peón débil de f7 pueda seguir siendo atacado con la dama, y además ataca el peón en e4.      otra jugada de control del centro. se evita 3... d5, que sería una jugada bastante fuerte.      las negras continúan presionando sobre el centro.      es habitual que las blancas hagan d3 en las primeras jugadas de las aperturas de peón de rey, ya que permite que se desarrolle el alfil de casillas negras a la vez que se defiende el peón e4. lo bueno es que la apertura del alfil ha permitido evitar de forma sencilla que el alfil de casillas blancas quede semi-encerrado en las casillas f1-e2.      es una continuación habitual, molestando al alfil que salió al principio, al que prácticamente se le obliga a cambiarse por un caballo. aún así, esta jugada tiene el inconveniente de que aleja el caballo del centro, que es donde suele ser más útil, mientras que al estar el alfil c4 defendido, no impide que las blancas continúen desarrollándose.      evita 5...cxc4 6.dxc4, que resultaría en una estructura de peones algo incómoda: en ese caso el peón e4 dejaría de estar defendido por otro peón, y además el peón de la fila d se alejaría un poco del centro, lo cual es ligeramente malo. sin embargo, las blancas tenían una alternativa interesante: 5.b3. esto les hubiera permitido evitar violar uno de los principios de la apertura (no mover dos veces la misma pieza en las primeras jugadas), a la vez que se daba una posibilidad de sacar el alfil de negras por otro lado.      las negras deciden cambiar caballo por alfil, lo cual es positivo tratándose de una apertura abierta, donde los alfiles suelen ser ligeramente más útiles que los caballos. además, el caballo no haría nada importante quedándose en a5.      ...pero este cambio de piezas también tiene una consecuencia que más tarde pueden aprovechar las blancas a su favor: se abre una salida interesante para la torre.      esta es seguramente la mejor jugada, pues se desarrolla el alfil de casillas negras antes de que pueda quedar encerrado por el avance del peón d7 a d6. por otra parte, el caballo c3 queda clavado, y gracias a la ausencia de peones blancos en la columna a, el alfil no puede ser atacado de forma eficaz (si 6. ta4, las negras pueden defenderse con 6...a5      las blancas atacan el peón central de las negras. aquí las blancas tenían otras alternativas interesantes, como desclavar el caballo (7.ad2) o clavar el caballo de las negras (7.ag5)       las negras ignoran el ataque a su peón central.      las blancas aceptan el regalo, aunque no está del todo claro que esta haya sido la mejor idea. a cambio del peón de menos, las negras tienen la iniciativa, lo que les permitiría contraatacar.     esta es la jugada correcta para contraatacar. a la vez que se ataca el caballo en e5, se abre la diagonal del alfil de casillas blancas.    probablemente hubiera sido mejor 9.cf3, a lo que se podría continuar con 9...ag4 10.0-0 h6    las negras se equivocan haciendo una jugada que permitirá a las blancas cortar el ataque interponiendo un peón que a su vez amenaza el alfil g4. la mejor jugada (y muy interesante) hubiera sido 9...d5!, a lo que las blancas tienen difícil una buena respuesta. si 10.e5 te8 y las blancas no pueden impedir que las negras recuperen el peón perdido y el control del centro. las blancas únicamente podrían evitar perder un peón con 10. exd5 cxd5 11.ad2 ta8+ 12. ce3 dg5 13.0-0 ah3, pero el ataque de las negras es muy difícil de contrarrestar.    el alfil de casillas blancas está obligado a retroceder, perdiendo con ello las negras la iniciativa. la estructura de peones blancos se ha vuelto muy sólida.    habría sido mejor llevar el alfil a d7, donde tendría mayor libertad de movimiento y posibilidad futura de ataque, o a e6, donde al menos se apunta hacia el centro del tablero    por fin las blancas pueden enrocar y proteger a su rey.    es difícil saber cuál era aquí la intención de las negras. la jugada no parece muy buena por quitar libertad de movimiento al alfil en b4, que está cada vez más desprotegido.    las blancas clavan el caballo negro. es un golpe más en el proceso de complicar los movimientos de las piezas negras.    muy mala jugada, que pondrá al alfil en una situación muy comprometida.. aquí lo adecuado hubiera sido 12...axc3, cambiando un alfil que apenas puede moverse por un caballo blanco que es muy fuerte controlando el centro del tablero. después, la continuación lógica sería 13.bxc3 h6 14.axf6 dxf6, y las posición de las negras solo es ligeramente peor que la de las blancas.    es la jugada lógica: para el jaque y encierra más aún al alfil de c5.    las negras intentan salvar su alfil de casillas negras desesperadamente.    las blancas utilizan el caballo que antes las negras no quisieron comerse para atacar simultáneamente alfil y caballo, aprovechando que este último está clavado.    las negras condenan a muerte definitivamente a su alfil. hubiera sido mejor 14...c5 15.c3 b5 16.cxb4 bxc4 17.bxc4, y las blancas solo habrían conseguido un peón extra.    se consuma el encierro del alfil.    quizá una mejor alternativa sería 15...b5, seguido de 16...c6. el alfil de b4 seguiría siendo capturado en el futuro, pero los caballos se hallarían en situaciones menos peligrosas, y además al hacer cxb4 quedaría una estructura de peones mucho menos favorable para las blancas.   en esta posición, las blancas no solo tienen un caballo de más, sino que también tiene sus piezas menores en una posición muy ofensiva. no parece mucho que las negras puedan hacer.   seguramente, las negras esperaban provocar aquí 17.axf6 gxf6, librándose así de tener piezas clavadas, pero...    las blancas buscan simplemente ganar un peón más.   única jugada no absurda.   las blancas han conseguido su objetivo, amenazando además la torre, y lo que es más importante, dejando abiertas las columnas g y h para poder atacar directamente al rey negro. el único defensor de la posición del rey es el alfil que ahora está en h5.   ¡ojo con la amenaza 19... txe4 (el peón de f3 está clavado)!   en principio, esta no parece la mejor forma de desclavar el peón f3, puesto que a su vez otro peón, (el e4, que para colmo puede ser atacado por dos peones negros distintos) queda a su vez clavado por la torre e8. sin embargo, las blancas van más allá: han colocado la dama en e1 para buscar un ataque rápido contra el rey negro.   las negras intentan aprovechar la nueva clavada, atacando al mismo tiempo el caballo blanco.   las blancas inician el ataque directo. se pospone el problema del caballo atacado gracias a que primero se obliga a las negras a salir del jaque.   es la única jugada legal que impide el mate dg7# en las jugadas 21 o 22.   es la jugada natural. no solo hay que retirar el caballo, sino también defender el peón e4. ahora, ese peón está defendido por el mismo número de piezas que lo atacan, siempre que no se tenga en cuenta el alfil g6 por estar clavado. si en algún momento ese alfil se desclava, el peón e4 será débil.   con el alfil clavado y el resto de las piezas inactivas, a las negras ya les es difícil encontrar una buena jugada. esta jugada no es muy buena porque permite a las blancas abrir la columna f, dejando vía libre a las torres para atacar.  ahora el peón f6 esta debilitado, y esa puede ser una buena puerta de entrada para el ataque al rey negro.  el peón d5 está clavado, así que no puede comer, pero sí avanzar. también puede ser defendido con una de las torres.  mediante el avance, las blancas consiguen un peón pasado, que por ahora no puede ser fácilmente capturado por estar ligado con el otro peón central. sin embargo, se crea una debilidad en la casilla 35, que no es grave porque el caballo puede defenderla cuando sea necesario.  bien jugado. las negras tratan de compensar el ataque que reciben en el flanco de rey a su vez atacando con peones el flanco de dama, donde las negras son en este momento algo más fuertes.  las blancas intentan darse más prisa que las negras en atacar. otra posibilidad interesante hubiera sido 24.h4, con la intención de atacar el alfil clavado con el peón. la opción de intentar parar primero el ataque de peones de las negras no parecía buena idea, por ejemplo 24.c4? bxc4 25.bxc4, y entonces el peón pasado h5 podría volverse peligroso. volviendo a la partida real, después de 24.tf4 hay dos planes posibles: doblar las torres (es decir, ponerlas en la misma columna) o hacer 25.tg4 (amenazando 26.txg6+ fxg6 27.dxg6, seguido de 28.dg7#). la única defensa buena ante esto último sería difícil de ver, pero existe: 25... de7!   por suerte, era el turno de las negras, y encuentran una jugada que elimina el fuerte ataque de 25.tg4, pues en ese caso las negras pueden simplificar la posición cambiando damas. en realidad cambiar damas podría no ser la mejor solución, puesto que no conviene cambiar piezas cuando se está en desventaja material; la alternativa hubiera sido  24... te5  las blancas realizan el otro plan anteriormente mencionado, consistente en doblar las torres.  las negras continúan muy bien con el ataque del lado de dama. la alternativa hubiera sido mejor intentar parar el ataque de las blancas, por ejemplo mediante 25... ta6 26.txf6 dxf6 27.txf6 txf6.  con esto las blancas ganan un peón y obligan a las negras a cambiar damas.  única opción buena. si por ejemplo se hubiera hecho 26... de7 entonces 27.txg6+ y las negras tienen que entregar la dama para evitar el mate 27...fxg6 (si 27...rh7 28.tg7+ rh8 29.tfxf7 dxf7 30.txf7 tg8 31.de5+ tg7 32.dxf7#; y si 27...rh8 28.ag7+ rg8 29.af6+ fxg6 30.dxg6+ rf8 31.ae7+ rxe7 32.df6#)  28.dxg6+ rh7 29.tf7 dxf7 30.dxf7  de nuevo, única jugada no absurda.  esta jugada es un error. con ella, las negras desperdician el último cartucho de su cagador: el peón de la columna a, que podría haber obligado a las blancas a abandonar el ataque para esforzarse en impedir que dicho peón se convirtiera en dama. por ejemplo: 27... a3!  28.ta1 a2 29. tf2 ta6 (con la idea de doblar las torres) 30.ae3 c4 31.bxc4 bxc4 32.cxc4 axc4, y aún así las blancas no tienen facil comerse el peón sin perder alguna otra pieza. es curioso el hecho de que el caballo no puede hacer mucho aparte de estorbar a pesar de ser la pieza más cercana al peón a. es lo que las blancas tienen que hacer a pesar de dejar el peón e4 sin defender. las negras deberían haberse comido al menos un peón: 28.txe4. ese peón no es recuperable por las blancas: si 29...cxc5 30.te3 y las negras capturan como mínimo otro peón más. interesante. las negras se ven forzadas a mover una torre para evitar el ataque doble del peón si este avanza hasta d7, y después se van a tener que emplear a fondo para evitar que se convierta en dama. las negras se suicidan. la continuación correcta hubiera sido 29...ted8, con lo que se impide por el momento que el peligroso peón pasado continue avanzando (si 30...d7 31.tc7). a partir de aquí, las negras ya no tienen mucho que hacer. la torre amenaza el peón al mismo tiempo que bloquea su avance. si las blancas quisieran defenderlo, tendrían que hacerlo indirectamente, mediante 31.ag5 (si 31... txe7 32.txg6+ fxg6 33.txe7 y las negras se quedan sin piezas). las blancas rematan con un bonito sacrificio. hubiera sido preferible no aceptar el sacrificio, y mover en su lugar 31...rh7, amenazando al mismo tiempo la torre y el alfil. aunque, a decir verdad, esto solo hubiera prolongado la agonía. ahora sí que no hay manera de evitar que las blancas saquen dama. las negras abandonan la torre a su suerte, pues la otra opción conducía a un mate más rápido: 32...txf8  33.exf8=d+ rh7 34.dg7# a partir de aquí, el mate ya solo es cuestión de tiempo y la partida ya no tiene mucho interés. ¡bonito mate en el centro del tablero y usando solo la dama y peones! las negras podrían haber retrasado el mate una jugada más si 36...rf7 o 36...re6. en todo caso sería mate después 37.th6 y 38.dh7#.

ouverture classique. attaque sur f7.  il s'avere que cette attaque est inutile, l'adversaire n'a qu'à roquer (ce qu'il doit faire de toute façon) ce coup n'était pas le meilleur, car je bloque mon pion en d.  bb3 était mieux, si kxbb3, axkb3 cela laisse la ligne a ouverte pour la tour. h6 me force à rebrousser chemin. je pousse a3 pour faire bouger  le fou ou le cavalier qui sont une menace potentielle. ce coup fut désastreux.  je n'ai pas vu que le fou en b6 enlevait la protection sur le cavalier en g3.  donc un cadeau pour mon adversaire. la tour est maintenant menacé et les places sont limités. l'arrivé de la reine en renfort me fait craindre le pire, mais mes pièces sont toutes bloquées et je ne peux ammener de renfort à ma défensive qui s'avère de plus en plus fragile. le but de cette poussée est de contrer la diagonale du fou noir. la tour était nécessaire pour garder un pion en c5, à la suite de c5, dxc5 et bxc5.  ainsi la diagonale du fou demeure bloquée.  je crois que mon adversaire jouera nf4, mais je ne peux rien faire pour l'en empêcher (g3, nxg3, et le fou noir empêche fxng3).  
-------------------------------------
mauvais jeux, puisque kxe4 et mon pion en c5 est attaqué par 2 pièces et seul le fou le protège. a4 n'était pas mauvais, mais j'ai opté pour c4 pour laisser plus de place à ma reine. j'ai opté pour l'échange plutôt que ba4.  je craignais les échanges si le pion avancait en b5, l'échange de pion aurait libéré la ligne a reine-tour pour les noirs. simple coup pour faire bouger le cavalier noir.  ce dernier m'empêche de sortir mon cavalier en c3 ou d2. ce coup me permet d'attaquer le pion en c6.  de plus si dxc4, la ligne d est ouverte pour ma reine, ce qui n'est pas mauvais. ce coup des noirs n'était pas prévu et me force à ramener la reine. l'échange de fou expose le roi blanc.  j'aurais du jouer qd3 plutôt que qd1. ici j'ai pris une chance, j'espérais que les noirs bouge simplement la tour.  le coup rxf7 aurait probablement été meilleur puisque le roque n'aurait pas été possible. je dois absolument protéger mon cavalier j'aimais mieux sortir mon cavalier.  si l'échange de tour se fait, je garde le controle sur la ligne f et espère surprendre les noirs avec qe8 pour le mat. l'échange se fait comme prévu. malheureusement les noirs ont vu le jeu. j'essaie de faire fuir le cavalier pour descendre qf7. je décide de ne pas descendre la reine, je crains kg3 qui me couterait ma tour.  je procède donc à l'échange de cavalier. à partir de là, il est clair que les noirs veulent provoquer l'échange de reine.  cette partie est terminé pour les blancs.  
-------------------------------------
i dont agree for white f4. i̇t is too early for open the wite king's front. espacially black situation is strong for attacking.   obvious white want to attack early. white try to take advantage for playing g4. thats the weak side for black. black also want to attack b4. the same tactic for white. both white and black attack the same side. black take an advantage and control for middle. white try to respond black and also attack with nc5!!! it is a good illustreted move. it blocks black game and also attack white a6 pawn. also weak the defence of black. but!!!! 21  black is sligtly stuck white kings. quenn and castle has a huge advantage for attacking left side. also black other castles can be help with rb8.  black continue to attack. both way attack for black.castle also attack qd8 and also threat b2 pawn for attacking. queen trys to exchange but black try to develop the attack with play qb6 thats the tactic with black. sacriface the knight with develop attack dangerously. thats it this move makes white in danger. also weak points of b2 pawn with this move is nightmare. also white has to escape queen but it makes worst for b2. resignation for white !!!!

in general most players try to get their pieces out as fast as they can and then castle their king into safety. your last move looks a bit too "slow". it doesn't "develop" any piece but instead makes the squares around your king more vulnerable. another pawn move.  pawn move nr 5.  it is considered to be a "chess sin" to move the same piece twice in the opening. (but of course the game of chess is far too complicated to be summerized in such generalities. there are lots of exceptions to this rule. ) black just wants to develop as fast as he can. taking the pawn forces white to play yet another pawn move. black has fulfilled his first tasks. bring the pieces out, castle the king into safety and put a pâwn on a central square. what is this ? black plays the same piece twice ! yes, right.. but black can afford to do so because he already has his king into safety. this is a mistake. because the f pawn has moved and the white king is still in the middle of the board, black can attack quickly a standard type of combination. the white pawn can't take back because it is "pinned". the queen would take the rook. it was not so easy to find a good move here for white, this move at least takes a pawn but .... the rook is lost. black can afford to be greedy because he attacks the white bisshop. threatens to take the bisshop. again it was not easy to come up with a good move for white. now the knight is invulnerable because of the bisshop moving to f5. another mean check. this allows black to give a forced mate. mate. lessons to be learned. don't play too slow in the opening, try to get your pieces out and your king into safety.
-------------------------------------
 brulla: major idea: spoil black’s short castling, start an attack on the king’s wing. i think, black should go for the quenn’s side attack.
-------------------------------------
 black weaknesses: queen’s wing not developed
-------------------------------------
 white weaknesses: king’s wing not developed, pawn b2 is not protected (could be in the next move, e.g. 0-0-0. (26.07.06) brulla:

 in our game, i want to try the variant with taking the white bishop: 5….bxh6 
-------------------------------------
 this variant seems to be quite popular and i found an interesting game (adams vs. van wely, european men’s singles championship 1992), which van wely eventually lost but to my impression due to a calculation mistake, not because of the opening. i send you the notation via e-mail.

mala la 16. ce2. no me gustaron las jugadas que van desde df3 (no es lugar para una dama), g4 y ce2. acá inventé un acierto donde en realidad había un error ajeno. es inexplicable ch7. corresponde dxe4 o bien cxe4 acá se equivoca. al cambiar alfiles no percibe que traigo otra pieza para capturar en e4. era correcta 20. cc3 en el partido pensé que no podía capturar. ilusión óptica. se captura y sigue c5. el cambio es forzado y el final de reyes se gana caminando de espaldas. bueno, como dijo ella, estaba cansada. igual el negro ya ganó. otro error. acá gano simplemente jugando rd3, 53 rb1, c2. el rey debe mover y juego rd2 asegurando la coronación.  
-------------------------------------
un' inizio di cavalli uh, cos'e? non capisco , dai che apertura è? ecco la colonna difesa il nero fa la moderna circonda il centro e....guadagnato? si!... ...no! cacciami ecco il primo scambio si vede si continua ad aprire che diavolo è? infatti e scappi van-tag-gio! però almeno è più 2! scacco....il primo e impedono ti minaccio pensate che ha scritto "beccate sta mossa" e tu questa! 
-------------------------------------
mon adversaire commence probablement à me surprendre en jouant c4. en effet, ce coup permet de sortir la dame en a4 sans que je fasse ...b5, et dans le cas suivant cela aurait donné 2.dxb5 et j'aurais eu une pénalité d'un point. je libère mon fou noir afin d'attaquer le roi adverse qui se trouve sur une case noire. deuxième protection pour le pion, en plus de la sortie du fou. cloue le pion dame, sans autre effet particulier que de faire perdre un temps, car au coup suivant 3.a3, mon fou doit reculer et donc me fait perdre un temps. libère son fou blanc tout en faisant une défense croisée, il aurait pu jouer 3.a3 en me faisant perdre du temps. je prépare un petit roque (que je ne ferai pas pendant la partie) et j'essaie de ne pas trop exhiber mon cavalier. comme il n'a aucune menace pour le moment, il veut me faire perdre du temps. obligé, car le déplacement en c5 offrait une perte de temps supplémentaire avec 5.b4 qui est protégé et la retraite en a5 fournissait une perte de temps avec le même coup. menace le pion roi. protection "pyramidale". mauvais coup car perte de temps, car il faudra rentrer la dame avec 6....g6 ! les blancs doivent encore bouger la dame. judicieux, car 7.dg4 offrait une menace supplémentaire avec le pion de la tour : 7....h5 ! mauvais coup, les pions et la dame l'empêchent de se déplacer. un coup plutôt calme ... le mouvement de la tour qui brise le petit roque. coup assez inattendu. le pion est protégé par la tour et le cavalier. marée de pions ! mauvais coup, le pion est sans protection. logique. rassemblement de pièces autour du roi. très bon coup, car il menace le fou et l'arsenal de pions et la dame l'empêchent de partir. menace la dame, et empêche le fou de se faire prendre, sinon le déséquilibre est trop important. obligé. assez inutile, protège encore plus le fou. les blancs veulent maintenant paralyser le camp adverse. mais ils pouvaient prendre le fou avec un meilleur avantage. bon coup, car permet aux pièces de se déplacer. menace le pion et, au coup suivant, la tour. empêche le cavalier de prendre le pion. le cavalier ne pouvant plus bouger, le pion prend le fou. réaction immédiate. mouvement du roi incompréhensible. menace le cavalier. mauvais coup, le cavalier étant protégé par la dame. menace le fou blanc. menace la tour. met le cavalier en zugzwang. menace la tour. logique. les blancs se resserrent en défense. permet d'égaliser. menace la dame et la tour. bon coup. le cavalier ne pouvant pas être pris, j'éloigne la dame. attaque le pion en f5 mais ne fait pas 23. cxb6 qui lui aurait laissé un avantage de  2. le pion reste toujours protégé dans la diagonale de la dame. le coup 24.fg2 semble le plus adapté car il menace le cavalier, mais ... ... il préfère prendre la tour et ainsi se sacrifier pour rien ! un très mauvais coup. coup douteux, car forme une rangée de pions doublés. zugzwang pour les blancs ! est protégé par le pion et fait échec. le tournant du match. j'ai tout d'abord fait ce mouvement pour faire un mat en prenant le pion e3 mais je me suis rendu compte plus tard que la tour empêchait l'échange des dames, même si le pion d7 était ailleurs. se dégage de la ligne de mire de la dame noire. depuis ce coup, les noirs feront toujours échec. le recul en f2 semblait plus approprié. la dame est protégée par le cavalier. forcé. un coup extrêmement ... nul. en effet, 30. fxe3 prend la tour et empêche les noirs de mater. les blancs durent être décontenancés ou jouer trop vite, mais ils jouèrent 30. rf2??.
-------------------------------------
 plus tard, je me rendis compte que je m'étais inintentionnellement appuyé sur les erreurs de mon adversaire. le fou a été totalement oublié. le mouvement 30.fxe3 garantissait un rétablissement des blancs. très mauvais coup. protégé par la dame et le pion. obligé. et c'est maintenant qu'une petite pièce insignifiante va aider au mat ... un excellent coup qui coupe la retraite du roi. obligé. et le superbe mat final. le roi ne peut pas prendre la dame en f1 car la tour la protège. et le roi ne peut pas aller ni en f2 à cause de la tour et de la dame, ni en g2 où il est attendu avec la dame et le pion.

a good game by my opponent, helped at the beginning by a stupid distraction from my side, but he deserved the victory for the nice behaviour until the end. -or, how to exploit quietly a small advantage. and this is my first distraction: i was playing najdorf... and all of sudden i forgot to play the key move a6... but though, here it is still viable. not yet a mistake inaccuracy, but not a mistake. this is the mistake. a "better" move would have been gxf. and this is how to  forced nice shot forcing the encounter. results of the inaccuracy. one pawn up and an execllent rook + a better developpement. best answer. maybe my best move of the game. developping quietly and intelligently i have hesitated with bd7, but i don't see what is better, anyway. now white will take profit of its advantage. tempting to create a hole in the defense. chasing too many rabbits. good guess coordinating the forces. i had to think: it is only one pawn, it is only one pawn... but freedom is claerly clever. only the knight could chase this strong rook now. so, it moves. entering in the game. forced. but i am pretty sure this was his goal since move 21. chasing the rook... or provoking exchange? worsing the structure. now, i had no more hope... i just continued because freedom deserved the game. my bishop loses all efficiency "toi qui entres ici, abandonne toute espérance..." my last hope (if ever) to enter into c-column is broken. playing for playing. avoiding mistakes that could lead to a dangerous mate net with king and knight. preparing the capture of h-pawn and the advancing of his. did not expect that. if exf, then nd5+! trying to attack another piece of cake... if i can take this pawn, i can threat the rooks. intersting! interesting? llok at the serie: r(whatever)xd5 exd5 could lead to some complications for white. but no! white chose the best answer! forced escaping from the trap. and taking one more pawn. of course not bc6, that would lead to a mortal nc7+ re-focusing on h6 there is no more defence... congratulations, freedom

et dårlig trekk siden du har førstetrekk fremover. jeg tror dette setter et press på deg for å beskytte e4-bonden, samtidig som jeg ikke ser resultatet av dette trekket og videre dårlig trekk ved at jeg ikke får castlet.
-------------------------------------
 bedre ville trekket som jeg tok neste gang 2...d6 eller 2...sc6 (tror trekket 2...de7 ville stengt for løper og dermed vært et dårlig trekk, men ikke dårligere enn 2...sf6 nok et dårlig trekk. 3...le6 eller 3...de7 hadde vært bedre. her må jeg som sagt gi opp castling, samtidig som jeg også ikke får utviklet løper pågrunn av det dårlige trekket 3...d6 her er jeg allerede innestengt og prøver å åpne opp e-raden. bedre hadde nok 5...c6 eller 5...sc6 vært? jeg blir presset av bonden på e5. velger å plassere meg sentralt, med dekning av bonde på d5. dette presser meg til å bruke et trekk ved å flytte kongen tilbake til opprinnelig posisjon. og dermed bruker jeg opp tid til utvikling. her ser jeg en pin så flytter vekk for å unngå. 13.sa5 et bedre trekk? bedre ville nok 18.lf6? løper hadde da sperret at tårnet ble tatt. og der en bonde. her føler jeg at det blir innesperret så prøver å sette press på springer. ser ikke at neste trekk gir sjakk. burde nok heller konsentrert meg om andre ting? selv om løper er låst på c8. her burde nok kongen heller tatt løper for å skape enn sammenheng mellom dronning og løper som kunne presset din dronning jeg må da bruke dette trekket for å få tårnet i spill, samtidig som jeg åpner opp for en mulig pin på d6. her så jeg rett og slett ikke springer som har kontroll på bonden på h-fila. jeg tenker mest angrep istedet for å prøve å komme meg ut av det. posisjonen er vel allerede her så kjørt at jeg er dømt til å tape? ofring av løper som uansett er låst, som egentlig bare gjør alt værre. først her skapes kontakten som kunne vært skapt 4 trekk før. og her kommer nådestøtet. altfor fort ved at jeg blir altfor offensivt. prøver på for mye og bruker ikke nok tid på å analysere hvordan brettet er. altfor lette nybegynnerfeil. hva synes du? 
-------------------------------------
annotation updated july 22, 2010.  this was a non rated game for tutoring purposes, between myself, scott miller (faithfulltrav) and my new friend ajay (grey_sparrow).  so, ajay, i want to start by letting you know a little about where i am coming from when i tutor chess, my favorite game. first i want to say, there are varying ideologies and styles of play. i for one am a fairly aggressive, very calculating player. i am a much stronger tactical player than i am strategic. for the difference, imagine a general in a war. he may say to his men "ok, there are 10,000 of us. i want 9,000 men to lay in wait at the top of this hill. the other 1,000 of you go make like you are attacking the enemy town down below. when they come out after you, flee to the cave at the bottom of the hill. then the 9,000 at the top attack them. that is strategy. it is an overall plan. then the general may say, "when you engage in hand to hand combat, use the long swords, as you can strike from a greater distance. keep your daggers ready though." that is a tactic, not a strategy. strategies give general direction, tactics are more specific.  so in our game, for example, my strategy in the middle game was to force you to trade off your dsb, then infiltrate the dark squares near your king and form a mating net around him. that's strategy, my basic game plan. tactics are putting my bishop on g5 to chase your queen away, my knight on f6 to check your king, and when you trade my knight off, taking back with the pawn to attack your g7 square, ect. so tactics are the processes used to apply the strategy.   a more strategic player may look at one of my comments and say, "ajay, this guys is leading you wrong." it's not that i'm leading you wrong, but that i can only lead based on my own style. a strategic player will lead differently than a tactical player. a passive player will give different advise from an aggressive player. that's not to say anything bad about passive chess players, as i've met passive players who i could not beat. i had a friend in college named pablo. he'd sit back, making very passive moves. he'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up, then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive!  so when taking advise, (from me or anyone else) take it all in from as many sources as possible, then make a rational decision for yourself, based on your own style and abilities, what is for you. this opening is the colle system, where white sets up his pawns in this pyramid shape, temporarily blocking in his dsb, while he prepares to gain a strong attack with e4. it is an unique opening in that it can be played almost regardless of black's moves. so ajay, i have not noted any of your moves up to this point because i felt all of your moves were very solid! you are playing something like the kings indian defense (kid). i say "something like", because the knight usually goes on d7, not c6 in this defense, and a pawn needs to be pushed to e5 or c5. but the knight move i think is o.k. i personally see no real problems with the knight on c6. in the kid though, you need to push the pawn to e5 or c5, (in this case e5, because the knight blocks c5). otherwise you may find yourself somewhat restricted. there is more than sufficient support for e5, while the pawn on e6 blocks in your queen side bishop. another reason you should play e5 is that i am playing the colle system. my pawn center needs to be confronted. you later moved your knight so that you can move the c-pawn, but i will speak on that later. preparing for the push to e5. ajay, this is in my humble opinion, your 1st serious mistake.  there are principles in chess, just as in life, which if you violate, you risk serious consequences. examples of these principles are: 1. develop your pieces as quickly as possible. 2. avoid double pawns. 3. don't keep your king in the center. castle instead. 4. and many more!!!  two such principles are: 1. develop toward the center and 2. avoid moving the same piece over and over again in the opening. in the initial moves of the game, focus primarily on the 4 central squares d4, d5, e4 and e5 and secondarily on the squares immediately surrounding those squares. each piece and central pawn should either occupy or control one or more of these squares. one of the reasons for this is that when you move a knight to a5, for example, it will take the knight longer to get some where else you need him to be. he would have been beneficial to you in defending your king in this game. if he were on c3 where you had him, it would take less moves to get him to the kingside. a knight on c6 controls 7 dark squares in the area. a knight on a5 only controls 4.  you obviously moved the knight so you could play c5, and you probably planned on putting the knight back afterwards. so, if you put it back on your 12th move, that would make 3 knight moves in the 1st 12 moves of the game. that means 25% of your moves have been made by one piece (3 out of 12). that's not a good deal when you are needing to get all of the pieces in to play quickly!  if you really needed your pawn on c5 and your knight on c6, you'd have saved time by playing c4, then nc3 which takes only 2 moves. moving your knight to c6, then to a4, then pawn to c4, then knight back to c6 take 4 moves. it may seem unimportant, but one of the most important principles in the opening is quick development of all pieces. among strong players, there is a constant battle to gain even a small lead in development.  there's a term in chess called "tempo". that is the term to describe how far behind or ahead you are in development. a tempo is measured by 1 move. the following paragraphs, i copy and pasted from wikipedia.org.  "gaining tempo may be achieved, for example, by developing a piece while delivering check, though here too, if the check can be countered by the development of a piece, the net result may be nil. if the check can be blocked by a useful pawn move which also drives the checking piece away, the check may even lose a tempo.  in general, making moves with gain of tempo is desirable. a player is said to have the initiative if they are able to keep making moves which force their opponent to respond in a particular way or limit their responses. the player with the initiative has greater choice of moves and can to some extent control the direction the game takes, though this advantage is only relative, and may not be worth very much (having a slight initiative when a rook down, for example, may be worthless)...." when considering moving a piece to a certain square, ask yourself, "can this piece be chased if i go here? if it is chased away, where can it go? when it goes to that 2nd spot can it be chased? if so, where can it go?" and so on... so this knight, in moving to g4, started a frantic escape attempt which ended with him throwing himself on the sword. he was sitting on h6, being attacked and no where to go. the better option instead of 12. ... ng4 would have been nd7, where he attacks the e5 pawn. you could then quietly develop an attack on that pawn by qc7 and nc6. the chase begins! this is the beginning of my plan to infiltrate your king side. in order for my plan to work, i need you to trade off your dsb. will you help me please? :-p one last chance to save the knight. when i attack here, you could move him to e7. it's not as good as d7 would have been before though, but at least you keep the knight. so, a knight on a black square can only move to white squares, and vice-versa. so at a glance, you can see this knight only has 4 white squares he connects to. each of these squares is either attacked by me or occupied by you. so you should have seen before moving to this square that it makes your knight an easy prey. if i chose to, i could have won the knight by playing qc1, then bxn. this would contradict my plan though because you can trade off bishops, and i need my dsb for the infiltration of your dark squares. the plan i chose wins the knight, gets rid of your bishop and keeps my bishop on the board. also ajay, you if you can make your opponent move one piece repeatedly, you gain the initiative. you have moved this knight 6 times: 2. nf6, 12. ng4, 13. nh6, 15. nf5, 17. nh6, 19. nxg4. that's nearly one third of your moves made by one piece! read again the annotation on your 9th move.  so you've moved one knight 3 times and the other 6 times. this hinders your ability to develop your pieces. every principle has some exceptions. i told you earlier about not putting your knights on the side of the board. let me relate it to a real life situation (as i frequently do. you'll notice that's how i teach). there are governmental laws made for our benefit, some of which can save our lives if we abide by them; not driving through a red light for example. yet, imagine if you have an injured loved one in critical condition. there is no ambulance in your town, so you have to drive them a half hour to the hospital. you come to a red light at an intersection where there are no buildings around, only open fields. so you can see far in all directions, and you know there are no cars coming. will you stop at the light? some people would speed through, some may slow down. i don't think anyone in their right mind would come to a complete stop and look both ways before continuing, the way the law says to do. when a person is on the border line between life and death, every second counts. so, the consequences of stopping can be far more grievous than driving through. when considering a move that violates the laws of sound chess, evaluate whether the benefits of such a move outweigh the drawbacks. if they do, go for it. over time you will learn when it's o.k. to violate a principle. in the case of my knight on h4, i knew when i put it on f5 (sacrifice) the knight would threaten nh6 mate, (after i get my bishop on g7). so you would have to take, thus opening more lines of attack for me. therefore, it is worth violating the principle. this move was to get a rook on the h-file, to enhance the attack on the king. the plan i had at this point never materialized. i was looking the the following sequence of moves, white pieces only: bg7, to lock the king in; nf5 threatening mate; rxp threatening rh8 mate. if you take the rook, the other rook comes in, rh1+. when you move to g8, rh8 mate! it was okay that my plan did not work, because i had a good position, a strong attack and a material lead. if one plan does not work out, so long as your making good moves, another one will materialize. as nuntar said in his comment on my annotation (move 17), "ah, but it's good to be flexible and notice occasions when a plan can profitably be abandoned for a better one!" i saw the threat to take the pawn with check, but i knew where i would put my king for relative safety, so i was not concerned.  i actually saw it when your rook was on e5, and i used the conditional moves system for the following scenarios:  25.bg7e3+	26.f3  conditional moves set 1 26 …	rg5 27. nf5	rxg4+  28. kf1	h5  29. ne7+	kh7  30. rxh5# conditional moves set 2 …	rg5 27. nf5	gxf5  28. rxh7	kxh7  29. rh1+	kg6  30. rh6# conditional moves set 3 26. … 	rg5  27. nf5	gxf5  28. rxh7	rxg4+  29. kf1	kxh7  30. qxf5+	kg8  31. qxg4 conditional moves set 4 26. … rg5  27. nf5 gxf5  28. rxh7 kxh7  29. rh1+ kg8  30. rh8#.  threatening 28. nh6 mate! postponing the mate with a check.  now i wanted to play 29. rxp, threatening 30. rh8#. you could play 29. ... kxr 30. qxp+ rg6 to keep me from taking the rook back, 31. qh5+ kg8 32. qh8 #.  i felt it would not work though because, 29. rxp deserts the back rank. you'd have 29. ... rg1+ 30. kxr (forced) qg3+ 31. kf1 qf2 #.  what i had not looked at is the following line: 29.	rxh7	rg1+ 30.	kxg1 qg3+ 31.	kh1 bxf3+ 32.	bxf3 qxf3+ 33.	qg2 qxg2+ 34.	kxg2 kxh7 35. rh1+ kh8 36. rh8#. while it is true i made a triple threat with qxp, if you had played rg6 to save the rook and rook pawn, i would not have taken the bishop. if i have option to take a piece or force a mate, i'll mate, of course. look at this one: 29. ... rg6 30. rxh7 kxh7 31. qh5+ kg8 32. qh8#. also, if you had attempted a counter attack, 29. ... rg6 30. rxh7 rg1+ 31. kxg1 qg3+ 32. kh1 bxf3+ 33. bxf3.  one of the most important principles in the game is to see what is and is not protected. you did not see that the rook pawn was attacked by the rook and queen.  ajay, it's been a pleasure!  thanks and god bless, scott

un coup inhabituel, mais probablement jouable. les blancs développent leurs pièces pendant que les noirs n'ont joué que des pions. je me suis demandé dans cette position si les blancs n'auraient pas fait mieux de continuer leur développement différemment, vu que les cases noires des noirs sont un peu faibles. ce coup permet aux noirs soit d'échanger les fous sur cases noires, soit de forcer les blancs à retraiter le fou. il est souvent plus profitable de laisser en suspens une faiblesse adversaire (ici les cases noires) pour l'exploiter plus tard, que de tenter de l'exploiter tout de suite lorsqu'on n'en retire pas d'avantage immédiat. à part cette subtilité, le coup blanc est correct. les blancs conservent un léger avantage. pourquoi? ils ont une pièce de plus de développée, les pions noirs au centre pourraient constituer une cible, le pion g des noirs est avancé (mais les fous sur cases noires sont partis, donc c'est moins grave), les pions blancs sont plus compacts. tous de légers avantages, mais qui démontrent que les blancs ont bien réussi leur ouverture. rien à redire sur les derniers coups. les blancs continuent d'avoir un léger avantage. une petite réflexion-question ici. pourquoi ce coup serait-il meilleur que e4 par exemple? parce que ce coup développe une pièce, qui protège l'autre cavalier en plus, permet de libérer la tour. e4 sera toujours possible si les blancs jouent leur tour en d1, bien que les blancs pourront placer leur cavalier en e5 où il est plus menaçant. meilleur était r(a1)d1. ceci force l'avance du pion noir. bien que ce ne soit pas nécessairement mauvais pour les noirs, les deux pions noirs du centre peuvent constituer une cible plus tard (avec le danger de se retrouver avec un pion isolé). le pion b2 devient maintenant une cible pour les noirs. attaque le pion maintenant faible en b2. est-ce que cette manoeuvre va profiter aux blancs ou est-ce une perte de temps? les blancs pensent-ils à suivre avec qf4?
-------------------------------------
  avec ce coup, les noirs font perdre du temps aux blancs puisque le cavalier doit reculer. mais les noirs vont aussi perdre du temps puisque le roi devra venir protéger le pion h6. la question est de savoir si la structure des pions devant le roi noir sera meilleure pour autant. je crois que oui, parce que la faiblesse sur les cases noires devant le roi n'existe plus, et le roi noir a plus d'espace pour manoeuvrer. d'un autre côté. il faut faire attention de ne pas trop avancer le roi et ses pions en avant, parce le roi peut devenir plus facile à attaquer, notamment par les pions en avant du roi blanc. donc, je crois que la manoeuvre du cavalier commencée au 17ème coup par les blancs est erronée. correct! mais valait-il mieux mettre cette tour en d1 et forcer le pion d5 à avancer ? ... la réponse suit... les noirs décident de pousser ce pion malgré tout. il faudra l'avancer tôt ou tard, alors pourquoi pas maintenant? donc, la tour blanche est maintenant mieux placée en e1 qu'en d1. une erreur significative. je me suis dit : le pion ne peut pas prendre le cavalier, et la dame doit reculer. mais nulle part je n'ai réalisé que la dame pouvait simplement prendre le cavalier.  je ne peux pas me permettre de perdre ce pion en plus. permet le coup suivant des noirs. a4 était probablement mieux. bon, mais pas aussi efficace maintenant. les noirs ont pris un pion, et ont encore des chances de s'en tirer. un deuxième pion en vue. la stratégie des blancs ici doit être de libérer leur tour de la protection du pion b. il faut que cette tour devienne beaucoup plus active si les blancs doivent espérer l'emporter. c'est donc un cavalier qui devra prendre la relève. excellent! les noirs tentent de briser cet étau des deux cavaliers blancs au centre (le centre est évidemment la position idéale pour des cavaliers de toute façon). aurait-il été mieux d'échanger une paire de cavaliers? je le crois. la différence est que les deux cavaliers blancs ne sont plus aussi bien centrés. ... et les noirs peuvent encore menacer l'échange. décision courageuse de se mettre en position d'échec à la découverte, mais les noirs se disent qu'il y a plusieurs mauvaises façons pour le blancs de faire cet échec. je crois que ne4 échec était meilleur pour capturer tout de suite le pion c5. j'aurais probablement joué ke5 et après la capture du pion, mon roi serait au moins au centre. le roi noir est relégué au fond, mais le pion c est toujours vivant. il y a toujours de l'espoir pour les noirs. tout à coup les blancs ne verraient pas le mat sur la première rangée! fallait pas rêver en couleurs! le seul espoir des blancs est le pion c. le roi doit s'approcher pour l'aider à passer à dame. suit une série de manoeuvres pour contrer l'avance du pion. le choix des coups peut être discutable, mais les blancs réussiront à empêcher le pion noir de trop s'approcher de son but. les blancs ont maintenant une victoire facile. je continue juste pour voir comment les blancs vont conclure l'exécution. une conclusion pleine d'élégance. et si les blancs jouaient trop vite...et prendraient avec la tour ??? fallait pas croire aux miracles. c'est le temps pour les noirs d'abandonner. une seule erreur des noirs a suffi. les blancs ont été impitoyables. rien de spectaculaire, mais des coups efficaces jusqu"à la fin. bravo!

 one of the obvious things you can check before making the move you have chosen is : if you have a piece that is more advanced in the enemy’s territory, be sure that piece has an escape route, and that it can not be trapped by the opponent’s pieces (or pawns). this is especially true if that piece is your queen.
-------------------------------------
i chose this game to demonstrate that while many lines in the philidor are equal, they contain quite a bit of tension, besides being pretty unbalanced. one of two possible move orders to reach the philidor defence. this move order is known as the philidor hanham and i favour it over the classical move order with 1.e4 e5 2.nf3 d6 because of the interesting and often fairly sharp lines with f4 or g4. black can also play 3...e5 here but then they have to be prepared to play an equal endgame with few winning chances after 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.qxd8+ kxd8. preparing a future ...d5 and threatening ...b5. preventing 7...b5. dubbed the archbishop attack by james vigus in his book the pirc in black and white, inspired by canterbury where he was staying while studying it, this line has also been tried against the philidor with the 1...d6 move order. dissolving the centre and also solving the threat of 9.g5. taking on either e5 or d5 is probably good for black, so instead white focuses on development. the knight stands well on e6. black has equalized. intending to exchange light squared bishops by 18...bc6 and 19...bxg2. taking control of the d5-square that black surrendered with 17...c5. continuing with the plan. white´s king is a bit airy after the exchange of the light squared bishops. the knight will be pretty annoying on f4, so white does best to get rid of it. the knight is very strong on d5, so white sees no reason to exchange it for the bishop. capturing on b2 was not really a threat as white wins back the pawn and gets to put a rook on the seventh rank after 24...bxb2 25.rab1. note also that 25.g5? was impossible due to 25...bxg5. in light of white´s vulnerable king position, an exchange of queen for two rooks is feasible for black, but first i need to create luft for my king. preparing to triple on the e-file and also protecting the b2-pawn. both minor pieces now have good squares. reactivating the queen. lacking a plan, i chose to wait by repeating moves. in order to reach the seventh rank white has to give up the a-pawn in return for the black b-pawn. so as not to allow white to cripple my kingside pawn structure by taking the bishop on f6. an interesting strategical struggle has commenced, with black trying to exploit white´s weak king position with the queen and the bishop while white will try to infiltrate by doubling rooks on the seventh rank. if 34. rxf7 then 34...qa2 35.rc2 qb3 or 35.ne3 bxe3 36.rxe3 wins back the pawn, in the latter case with a likely repetition of moves. better than the immediate 34...qa1, as the rook will have to get off the seventh rank in order to protect the c4-pawn. i could have opted for a repetition with 35...qa2 36.rc2 qb1 37.re2 qa2, etc. in light of my chosen continuation 35...qa2 36.rc2 qa1 would probably have been more accurate, as the rook stands worse on the closed c-file than on the open e-file, from where it is able to join its´ comrade to double on the seventh rank. protecting the rook in view of the threat 36...qg1+ 37.kf3 qf1+ 38.ke4 (or 38.kg3) 38...qxe2+. preventing the king from escaping through e4. 38.rg2 is bad in view of 38...qf1+ 39.kg3 qxc4. putting the f-pawn under protection, enabling ...be5 while also limiting the white king´s escape squares. threatening 40...qg5#. threatening 42...qg3+ 43.kh5 qxh3#. 42.ng2 would probably lead to a repetition. with mating threats after 44...bg5. protecting against the mate on h4. with 46...qf4 coming with the threat of 47...qg5#, white´s position looks lost, but haddibje has a magnificent save prepared. ! not 48...kf8?? 49.ng6+ +-. and here´s the whole idea. black cannot take the rook because then 51.ng6+ wins the queen and the game.  
-------------------------------------
i tried with the french defense. have not played that for a long time, but i felt i need to practice on it. i played the winawer variation. it becomes the winawer, advance variation here. a freeing standard move in this position. castling kingside is often the best choice, but not always. it´s even. threatening the weak e5-pawn. again threatening the weak pawn at e5. a quality rook sac. i already got pieces worth 4 pawns for the rook and also have broken up the pawn shield in front of white´s king. i want to open up the a8-h1-diagonal against white´s king. threatening a rook. maybe white missed that? i must watch out for a discovered check in the next move. the safest spot for my king. disastrous end of the game. white resigned. 
-------------------------------------
i played, again, with inasfour. the first game was commentated, in this game, both repeat opening´s line. how i analyzed the first game with fritz, the pc gives me a new line and i can play that. french defence, i play this defence when i want play strong (not for funny). 2 d4 it`s typiccal. white take the center and black challenges 3 nc3 and 3 nd2, are the "figthing alternative". 3 exd5 goes to a symetricall structure of pawns.  atacking to the base of chain`s pawn. now, white creates another chain`s pawn. b2-c3-d4-e5. thus, blacks had more space in queenside now. white creates the space in the kingside with 3 e5. more pressure to d4 this move, how i says in the another game, is not frequently. threating f5, what is the typpical attack to the black chain`s pawn. but nimzovich says what white aren`t why play this move now. i think what white is begining  a slow plan, when need the development after what a pawn` storm. common is 5 nf3. atacking d4 and pressure b2. another typiccal moves repeat last game. 6 ... h5 to not allows g4, to my juice, it`s so slow and weaking the kingside. allows the short castle.  obviusly, black can`t take in d4.  white forget your development. if plays f4 to attacks the kingside and now moves 9 a3 to gain space in queenside, white take to ambiciosus plan without development. bishop moves twice times and white plays six moves of pawn in nine moves.  allows the short castle and threating f6. this move, consequently with a3, it`s another pawn`s move. white take more space but the pieces in the queenside are sleeping.  not 10 ...c4, close the queenside. thus 10 ... cxb4 or 10 ... cxd4?i choice this move because now white have two choice, retake with c or a pawn. if i plays 10 ... cxd4 white olny retake with c pawn (or take with knigth but 11 nxd4 nxd4 12 cxd4). now, white can choice open the c-column or a-column.  in last game, i analyzed 11 ... nxb4. but does not good, but 12 cxb4 qxb4+ 13 kf2! and no more attack. (13 ... ng4+ 14 kg3 h5 15 h3). another variants are in the another game. a interesant move, i think what white need movilize the queenside, 13 be3 are an alternative or 13 qe2 and 14 be3, if white don`t like the bishop "hanging".  another move of a pawn, when all the black pieces are movilized. opening the column.  14 fxe5 or 14 nxe5? with this move, bishop in c1 can plays to the kingside do not allows 15 bxh6. threating qxh7+ before g4. now, in the last game, plays 15 ... g6 and before 16 g4 i played nfxd4, with adventage (see the game :d). in the posterior analysis, with the fritz, the engine gives me this move. when i see what my rival repeat with my the variant, i hope what he (or she) analyzed the position and introduces a better move. may be, he hopes what i plays 15 ... g6, again. but in the annotated game, i wrote this recommendation to the engine. now, the black pieces will falling how a storm in the center and kingside. well, fritz gives me 17 qd1 in the analysis to the anterior game, thus i now plays myself moves. but, i must recognised what i know what black has adventage for the engine. thus, i only must want the winner variation. specullating with the bc2 and rf1. both rooks puts pressure to the white position.  well, what can white choice? 18 qe3 rxc2 with the threat bxf1, rxc1 or ne2+-f3+. the double check it`s so danger. if 18 nxd4 rxf1+. 18 qxd4 qxd4 19 nxd4 rxf1+ 20 kh2 rxc1  cutting rook-queen connection. i think what this move it`s better what 18 ... rxc2. i forced the game now. if 19 kf1 bh4 threating qxf2++ and isn`t possible 20 nxh4 qxf2++. the alternative  20 g3 bxg3 and again white is lost. 21 qe3 nxc1+. the end, if white do not allows the mate in g1 with 21 bb2 rxh3 22 kxh3 qg3++  
-------------------------------------
standard opening for me at present, happy to play the qp, bdg or stonewall looking to transpo into the bdg after d5 standard bdg setup  i find this is the quieter way of playing the bdg, have seen some interesting games with qxf3 instead h3 is again a book move, however in hindsight against this opponent i do not want to give the the pawn headstart and let him blow open my king cover i believe i will start trying some alternatives to this h3 move.  options: bd3 is a good developing move and allows the short castle bg5 is also an attacking developing move    this is the position i did not want to be in, played a similar game recently where i managed to win from here but i feel too exposed probably one of my better moves as he cannot bump me off without threatening his bishop, expecting nc6 i was surprised to see e6 here, can only assume he wanted to open up the dark bishop i contemplated carrying through with one of my earlier thoughts of taking the bishop with nxg6 but felt that the knight was causing more trouble where it was at present, although the nc6 or bd6 would put pressure on it.  chose to play bg2 to attack the unprotected pawn at b7 trying to get the king to safety 'of sorts' he is putting more pressure on the e5 sqaure and has double protection on the e4 and d5 squares still down a pawn but feel like i am ahead in development at this stage which is the sacrifice of the bdg gambit i took the knight here, as i did not want to have nxe5 dxe5 qxd1 and heading towards an endgame, a better option could have been bh2 keeping the diagonal open for h2-b8 pinning the pawn at d4 and threatening qxb2 taking away the threat to b2 increasing support to d4 that bishop on g6 is starting to haunt me now, protecting some valuable squares! trying to take some pressure off the center, not realising that martin had a double attack on the d4 square i couldn't see a better option here but the gk computer post game analysis said i could play   best: -4.45 » 23. ne7+ kb8 24. qe1 rd1+ 25. kh2 rxe1 26. raxe1 qc7+ 27. kg1 qxe7 28. rxe4 qc5+ 29. kh2 rf8 30. h4 qd6+ 31. kh1 c5 32. a3 kc7 just a matter of time now  
-------------------------------------
this is the benko opening or the king's fianchetto opening, or hungarian opening. it is not as rare as many think, but probably the 5th or 6th most common opening for white  d5 is one of the best replies, taking control of the centre...all important in chess. less obvious openings such as the benko are based on letting the opponent take the centre initially, but attacking it later!  why not to the evident right away? the literature finds 2. nf3 to be better. god only know why (i don't)  why? why not 3. d4. or nf3. not bad but weak.  the logical answer. if you don't take control of the centre, i will. i think black has some advantage now.  about time. good move!  4. ...bd6 might have been a little better?  a good natural move. 6. c4 might have been worth thinking about.  too weak, i almost think 'too shy'. 7. e4 had been much better  black is immediately taking advantage of the 'shyness' - excellent move!  8. ...nxe4 had been much better giving white an awkward double pawn  this is a mistake, because b´black can now move nb6....  ...however, black takes en passant, which equalises the position  this may be a little questionable as it weakens black's king position. bf5 or bg4 may have been better?  repositioning of the knight had been much better neg5 or ned2  11. nf4 had been much better  right! and now this game is very close to equalised  this is a mistake. 12. ...qxd5 would have upheld the equality. now white has a significant positional advantage  by far the best move  qb3+!! kxg2 had led to qd5+ and loss of the game!  right!  ?? for what purpose? qc2 and qc4 were on the path of winning the game  fortunately for white black doesn't see the releasing move 17. ...bb4! now white is back in the lead...  probably the best move although be3 was very good, too  rac1 had been better...  after material again? a3 or dxc4 had been much stronger  q exchange had been better for black  excellent advance  the game was drawn at this point. in my evaluation white had a winning position both positionally and with respect to material.  
-------------------------------------
ora il nero ha un cavallo per un pedone e un lieve svantaggio di sviluppo.. comunque a gioco corretto dovrebbe essere vinta per il n.  non mi aspettavo questa mossa.. generalmente è sconsigliato muovere la donna troppo presto in apertura, qui però mi ha dato qualche fastidio..  alternative variation: [mi sembrava migliore di] 7. exd5 [, anche se analizzando sembrano entrambe giocabili per il b. se] qxd4 [segue] 8. qe2+ ne5 [con parità]  non avevo considerato la forte risposta del n.  con vantaggio marcato per il n.  alternative variation: [ altra imprecisione.. forse era meglio] 10. e5 alternative variation: 10. re1 ng4 [e il n. vince]  alternative variation: [si poteva prendere il p. con] 10... nxe4  alternative variation: [era meglio] 12... bd6 13. g3 qh5  così si perde un pezzo, come indicato nella nota seguente  alternative variation: [ restituisce il favore.. si vinceva con] 16. a4 bc4 17. nf4 qa5 18. b4 qa6 19. a5  alternative variation: [il n. è "generoso" e vuole proprio restituire il pezzo, che si teneva invece con] 16... bxe2 17. qxe2 kb7 18. a4 a6  di colpo la partita diventa vinta per il b.  una norma generale consiglia al giocatore in svantaggio di cambiare meno pezzi possibile.. quindi td2 è un errore perchè facilita il compito nel finale al b.  un altro errore, dopo questa mossa il cambio anche della seconda coppia di t è forzato, il finale di r risultante è senza speranza  e il n. abbandona, perchè il pedone c è inarrestabile. una partita istruttiva, dove entrambi i giocatori hanno avuto occasioni vincenti, anche se la minore esperienza del n. ovviamente ha pesato sul risultato finale. e' in corso la rivincita su gameknot, vi terremo aggiornati!  
-------------------------------------
so she starts conventionally last time i played black against jo i tried the french defence and she played the exchange variation, and should have drawn, so i go back to the sicilian. she plays the so-called grand prix attack this is the most common reply, and the best she plays this funny pawn sacrifice. i think there are better moves. so i take she has to move the attacked knight i protect the pawn on e5 she attacks f7. now i don't want to play e6 immediately, so first i decided to develop with tempo with.... hitting her queen and she sacs the queen! i have to take the queen of course. this is not on the world gameknot database, but it is on the database of gameknot games. so she takes this pawn. forced! another check this is the best square. we have transposed into a couple of world database games. there are no less than 308 games on the gameknot database so she gets some material back, and also threatens nf7 winning more material i do this, following the world database. now nf7 can be met with qd4 and nxr(h8) with qd4xnh8, so white doesn't normally play that. as it kr�l wladyslaw (2423) vs. porkolab sandor (2000)  2007  i decide to attack with my knight, but probably the move in kr�l wladyslaw (2423) vs. porkolab sandor (2000)  2007, bg7 is better. so she gets another pawn back. her knights are very active. so i hit c2 she protects c2 this move is poor. i had illusions of going after the a pawn, but then i realised that i couldn't take it, so i end up just wasting time. the established move, kb6 is better. established theory gives that as a draw. this is a wonderful square for the knight. i need to exchange off these knights. so my knight retreats, heading for c7, exchanging the knight. we are out of the databases now. so she develops i hit her bishop she threatens discovered checks with her knight on e4. however i was more afraid of bh3, keeping her grip on the e6 square. so i have to move my king yet again. according to the post-match computer i have a slight edge of plus 0.74 here. she protects that knight again. i reposition my queen, protecting the now threatened pawn on b7 she continues her development. preparing exchanges she hits my rh8 not a great square for a rook! i need to exchange both pieces and pawns and open up the board for my queen, which can't do much while there is so much material on the board. she builds up on e6 again so i start to exchange. she takes back i now prevent her from putting a piece on e6. post-match computer now puts me as up 0.92 and i have to agree. i can stabilise the weak squares in the centre with e6, maybe put my rooks on f8 and e8. this isn't bad for me now. i think this is poor, allowing me to exchamge knights and clear more wood from the board. the idea no doubt was to connect her rooks, which is something she needs to do, but maybe kd2 followed by ra1-d1 and kc1 was better. so i hop in, with the chance of hopping again to d4 if she doesn't take. computer puts me 1.07 up now. she takes. i take with the king. she checks my king goes back. now here is a great chance for her to re-establish her control of the white squares in the centre. i think she should play bd5 followed by be6 check and i am struggling to develop everything to good squares again. luckily for me she didn't and she played..... this, not a bad developing move, but, in my view, not the best. what do you think dear reader? so i hit f4 she protects. i hit it again. i am opening up the position, but she has chances in the more open position too. she takes. i take she throws in a check i retreat, blocking the connection of my rooks, but i can't afford to either advance to d6 nor to let the pawn on e7 drop. ke8, walking into a pin along the e file doesn't look clever either. computer puts me as 1.85 ahead now. she hits my queen, but computer prefers 28. kg2 qg6 29. bf3 fxg3 30. hxg3 qa6 31. rd2 rc8 32. a3 qh6 33. rde2 rc7 34. bd5 with black 1.79 ahead. 
-------------------------------------
  so white takes and i take. although this looks logical to me, the computer thinks this is a mistake and favours … rf7 32. h4 qb4 33. re4 qb6 34. re6 qa5 35. h5 qb4 36. be5 rf8 37. d4 c4 38. bxc4 qxc4 with black 1.05 ahead. after this blunder computer thinks white is 2.34 ahead and gives the continuation rxc2 32. be5 qb4 33. rg6 qxb3 34. be6 qxa4 35. rg8+ qe8 36. rxe8+ kxe8 37. bd5 rd8 38. bxb7 kd7 39. h4 rf8 40. bf4
-------------------------------------
jsprung prepares his pawn structure right away so i castle fast to attack the center nature says bishop on d3 must play d5 to not transpose this with e4 to a kingside attack(30 moves later) now on cxd5 cxd5 e4, the g7 bishop will have something to do! this game is pawn against developement, closing the position was not bad move i have to prove theory is right is the natural move his king have 2 moves andopen the way for both bishops i would play dxe5, if not cge2 for now there is nothing bad aparently on not developing because i am stuck on c8. here i was looking for space so the logical would have been b5, any ways he´s move had no sense i doubt it very much this way white activates his bishop but white neede to much moves to advance and my rook had it purpose, compare rooks now. its precise to finish developing bishop and from this positio i can attack the d4 square and the c5 spot treatens b5 and loosing my weak spot! i here doubt the strengh of the move but the alternative f3 made an intresting spot on e3 the logical choice better would be qb3 i dont see alternative how about qb3 nxd4? bxd4! bxd4 rad1 this is excelent, obvious ths is what jsprun did not see, the game was intended for this from 12...nf8!, white safes the rook with qc2,nd3,f3 and takes the initiative for the pawn! here is a clear advantage and enough to win!!

moже би по-лесно за белите би било просто да вземат на d6. но оценям желанието им за създаване на сложна комбинация. възможност за 6. ... dxe5 7. dxe5 - qxd1 8. kxd1 и белият цар губи възможност за рокадо. черните показват дързост в това изтласкване на белия кон. добър пробив! и тук според мен правилният ход за белите е 33. rxe8 ключов момент. според мен топът щеше да вземе добра позиция, ако бе взел на е8. все пак белите умело печелят пешка и карат черните да се оттеглят в защита в този момент, според моето скромно мнение, вместо да се защитава бялата пешка е по-добре да се премести напред, а атака. и двете пешки g и h нямат черни пешки на пътя и си и могат да бъдат използвани за преса на черните или дори за изкарване на дама ...както и в крайна сметка правят ra4 - и пешката на b4 няма как да се спаси (или b4, 45. rxc4)? смела, но наложителна жертва. и каква грешка на черните!! и колко ловко осъществено от страна на черните! изолират белия топ, който до този момент предпазва произвеждането на дама на c1, а белият офицер е "замразен" от черния топ. навярно белите се подлъгват, че черния офицер заплашва пешката им, когато тя е на d5, но всъщност той просто иска да препречи вертикалата на белия топ.   с този ход черните изкупват грешката си при загубата на своя кон. фактически произвеждането на дама е неизбежно. дори и белия цар да бе "отмразил" белия офицер, черния топ би се жертвал, след което би произвел дама и дал шах. белите остават с малко шансове за победа.

føler dette trekket var altfor offensivt. burde nok tatt betrakning for at jeg har en bedre posisjon enn deg, samt at du ikke får rokkert. når jeg ser tilbake ville nok trekket: 11. sf3 vært et bedre trekk ved å da evnt rokkere i neste trekk for å fjerne trusselen som 10... re8 skaper på kongen. jeg fortsetter å angripe og fjerner da den trygge posisjonen bak de 3 f,g og h bøndene. men er kongen egentlig så mye "tryggere" når da dronningene og 2 av brikkene er borte? nok et trekk som angriper en brikke som ikke blir dekket, selv om du ved det enkle grepet 14...c6 får flyttet fram brikken din samtidig som du kommer ut av angripet. her tenker jeg at du vil ta springeren, men at jeg vil fjerne den fordi den dekker f5 som jeg gjerne vil angripe med bøndene. hadde jeg rokkert så hadde jeg ikke trengt å fjerne springeren fra d2 og gi fra meg e4 bonden for å få en bedre angrepsposisjon. 18.kf2 hadde nok vært et bedre valg her da det hadde beskyttet springeren samt at jeg da kunne videre prøvd å angripe tårnet ditt for å bytte tårn som ville gitt meg en fordel ved at tårnet ditt er innesperret av løperen? her kommer trekket jeg kunne unngått ved å flytte 18.kf2. du får da dannet en pin på springeren som ikke ville skjedd ved en rokkering. dette trekket aner jeg ikke hvorfor jeg tok. kanskje jeg ville flytte tårnet til f2 for å fjerne tårnene, men tenkte ikke på at springer var låst. burde jeg heller kommet meg ut av situasjonen istedenfor å bytte alle brikkene som var igjen? her har jeg jo tapt uansett ved at du har 2 bønder fler? eller har jeg sjanse hvis jeg bruker kongen riktig?  
-------------------------------------
une expérience. autrement, les colonnes h et g ouvertes sont une bonne compensation pour la perte du pion blanc. le coup que les blancs avaient en tête avec leur 18ème coup. l'initiative change de camp. est-ce suffisant pour la perte de l'échange? je crois que roi en c1 était meilleur. le roi se place en plein sur la diagonale du fou noir et même si pour l'instant ça semble bien fermé, ça va s'ouvrir en grand bientôt. alerte maximale pour le pion c. après ce coup, la position blanche devient de plus en plus inconfortable. aurait-il été mieux de jouer roi en a1? la position blanche demeure difficile même après ce coup. ici roi en a1 était probablement le seul coup possible (ou dame en a3?) tout va s'ouvrir devant le roi maintenant. tentative désespérée du roi. bon réflexe. je me suis demandé si les blancs n'auraient pas fait mieux de tenter cette poussée plus tôt. c'aurait été une autre partie. le temps d'évaluer la position. les noirs ont une position gagnante mais il faut faire très attention au pion d blanc. il doit être sous haute surveillance car il peut encore faire renverser la vapeur complètement. un pion est un pion. les noirs ont maintenant trois pions passés et c'est ce qui va grandement faciliter le gain. un coup important. il faut empêcher toute tentative de pousser ce pion éventuellement. ici les blancs ont abandonné, un peu prématurément à mon avis. il suffirait d'un moment d'inattention et tout peut chavirer encore. mais il est clair qu'avec le moindrement d'attention, les noirs vont l'emporter. 
-------------------------------------
white has been on attack most of the time (except from move 15t to 20) but black defended very well and white had little occasions to make the difference and at risk, the draw is logical. central game black takes danish gambit... ...accepted i like this position for white : it gives open lines and diagonals and many attacking possibilities which is worth the pawn late. most common and natural move now white has to develop quickly to take profit of his position and compensate the late in material the common move in this opening menacing e4 but the weak f7 pawn will now be white's aim aiming at f7 protecting f7 white trades material is now equal efficient protection protecting the queen black trades now white has lost one move in developpement but black will have trouble to castle protecting the c7 pawn so that black cannot castle anylonger black cannot castle anylonger, has an unsafe king but rook on a semi open file in reward and developpement advance king in safe, rook on the f file. the f pawn can be pushed on f3 without danger because black has no more piece available to attack via b8-g1 knight on the center, menacing d3 rook on the semi-open file, preventing 15. nd3 but the ideal place for this rook was e1. black has the initiative black's plan seems to advance pawns on the queenside where he has the majority. drawback : it doesn't secure the king. white wants to conquier the center and directly menace the black king. defending the d file. second rook on the semi-open c file but it's a mistake. 16. nb5 with fork attack on black's a anc c pawn would have been better. joining the rooks protecting e4, so that white can move the c knight good move, covering the important d5 square to free the c file for the rook, oblige black to protect c6and enable a further nd4 advancing on the queenside, taking control of the d4 square, preventing 19. rxc6 back to his place, white's 18th move was fruitless. to double the rooks on the central file. so that black gets an isolated pawn. but  20. nb5 could have been better, forcing 20. ... rd8 for 21. bg5, menacing 22. f4. but it was unsure and white chooses the safest line, giving a little advantage without taking risk (therefore, nearing the draw). trading the rooks now white has taken the control of the open d file and black has an isolated pawn. advantage white but not enough to win. away from the d rook trajectory menacing aè and preparing an attack toward the black king. rook on protection white tries an attack on the kingside where he has the majority ... attack blocked to set the knight on f5 a good place for the knight : secured, it cannot be fired by a pawn. it's central (can quickly come on the queenside n case if black decides to attack there, using his pawn majority). king in safe second time on the same position. black proposes a draw, accepted.

esta es una partida de la cual me siento muy orgulloso, ya que es la primera mano que le gano a mi amigo pawnstar211 con el cual llevo 3 manos y me ha demostrado ser un gran jugador.  mi salida fue e4 como lo hago en el 95% de las manos que juego con las balncas. mi adversario hizo la francesa, por lo que opte por controlar el centro con ambos peones. considero que mi amigo cometió errores muy tempranamente al salir con el caballo f6 después de esa salida que hice. entonces aprobeché la oportunidad para hacerle perder tiempo. tres jugadas mas tarde yo tenia, aunque solo con peones, el control del centro y las diagonales abiertas de mis alfiles y mi dama. es hora de sacar la artillería pesada. para respaldo de las tropas que van delante. ahora aprovecho el tiempo mientras el intenta liberase del yugo de mis peones. como pueden ver a la altura de la septima jugada, parecería que yo he jugado varias veces consecutivamente sin permitir que el juegue. al intercambiar mi alfil de c4 por su caballo (en 8. bxd5 exd5), en vez de cobrar el peón que tengo en desventaja, capitalizo así la ventaja de tiempo que tengo dejándolo sin fichas importantes en el centro y yo ya tengo desarrollados mis dos caballos. en su novena jugada tuvo que defender su peon d5 con c6, otra jugada de peon de mi adversario la cual es aprovechada una vez mas por mí para continuar mi desarrollo. con mi alfil a f4. ooootra jugada de peon, esta vez en d6 que imagino que ha sido buscando abrirle la diagonal a su alfil de dama mientras propone el cambio de mi peon en e5. una vez mas aproveché para continuar mi desarrollo esta vez enrocando. a esta altura estoy completamente desarrollado mientras el solo tiene fuera un alfil. decido atarlo a ver si quiere realizar el cambio por el caballo. en este momento pensé que él podría optar por el sacrificio de su alfil por mi peón h3 para vulnerar la defensa de mi rey, este iba a ser un sacrificio que yo hubiera aceptado inmediatamente ya que mi ventaja de tiempo me lo permite. rechazó el cambio, y decidí manejar el riesgo que representa ese alfil en h5 dado que no quiero abrir la defensa de mi rey. empiezo a despejar las columnas centrales para mis torres. este no fue un error. mas bien fue un riesgo calculado que asumí para lograr poner mi reina en b7 si el opta por capturar mi caballo. efectivamente, optó por la captura del caballo. la jugada 15. gxf3? fue mala ya que abrí mi rey y no aproveche ese tiempo para lo que originalmente la había concebido. que era bajar de una con qb7. debilidad aprovechada. mi adversario se dispuso a atacar la vulnerabilidad creada, atacando mi alfil, mi peón en h3 y mas tarde probablemente mi rey. como ví que le faltaban por lo menos dos tiempos para darme jaque, fui por su torre. efectivamente el capturó mi alfil y yo su torre. para mi fue un buen negocio. dado que yo también tengo mi dama con un jaque a una jugada. be7?? capturo su caballo, jaque. a partir de aquí mi misión era evitar su enroque. asi lo hice. trató de cubrir la diagonal con su alfil para enrocarse pero eso solo aceleró el mate. jaque, liberando la columna d. jaque mate 2 en si juega kf8. así lo hizo y el mate era en la próxima jugada si no se rendía antes, como efectivamente lo hizo. me llena de satisfacción haberle ganado en 23 jugadas a un adversario tan bueno, aunque esta mano no es precisamente su mejor actuación. al que dude de su capacidad le invito a que lo rete.

-------------------------------------
the colle/stonewall attack — rare at the pro level, but very popular among attack-happy amateurs.  ? it seems like black played this move automatically, just because that's what he always plays. flexibility is important! here, by playing d4 and f4, white has voluntarily handed black the central light squares — especially e4. black should have grabbed those squares immediately with either ...nf6 or ...d5. although the idea of weak and strong color complexes is a pretty advanced one, i think most players at the 1500 level would still see d5/nf6 because they stop white from building a huge center. this is where it becomes so important to always be thinking flexibly and not playing on autopilot, even as early as move 2. ?! white has his/her own autopilot going here — s/he is so intent on playing the stonewall that not even the dominating central position brought on by e4! is enough to tempt him/her away from it. thus, we head back into normal stonewall lines. this is the essence of the colle/stonewall — white sets up bulwarks on d4 and f4 which keep e5 in a vicegrip while leaving d5 and e4 entirely under black's control. white will castle, play ne5, and play for an all-out attack on h7 with moves such as g4-g5, rf3-h3, qh5, and bxh7+ frequently playing their parts. white hopes that the blocked-up center will make it hard for black to get pieces over to the defence. this kind of attack can be devastating against the unsuspecting black player, who may underestimate white's offensive capabilities.of course, if white is not able to make the attack work, then the queenside pieces will be useless and the light squares will be desperately weak, leading to a very real danger of having zero play.  ? it is hard to see what the point of this move is. black should again take the e4-square under control with ...d5, followed by developing with …be7. as …ng4  neither controls e4 (in fact, it actively weakens black's control of that square) nor develops a new pieces, it should not have even been under consideration.  the best explanation i can find is that black wanted to play …f5, which is admittedly a very useful move — it controls e4, blocks the bd3, and rules out a future f5 from white — but this should not have been a realistic goal. white has several ways to rule out …f5 (even if, in the game, white did not decide to do so).  ? autopilot. chess is about thinking, people! yes, even during the opening, there is a lot to think about. here, black has a) declared his intention to play …f5, which would be very annoying to white, b) moved his knight a second time, onto a vulnerable square, and c) completely given up control of e4. playing 0-0 shows a blissful disregard for those crucial elements of the position. although i can't see any way to exploit the discovered attack on the knight to win material, we can use it to win time and/or space: either 7. ng5 nf6 8. e4 or 7. ne5 ngxe5 fxe5 would leave white with a very nice position. in fact, simply playing e4 right away and leaving the discovered attack for another time may be even better. in any case, white would have built a big center, ruled out or discouraged …f5, and proven …ng4 to be a waste of time. ! taking advantage of this opportunity with both hands.  now, white is going to have an awfully hard time getting any sort of attack going, since the bishop can't get to h7 and the queen can't get to h5. meanwhile, black's pieces are beginning to point menacingly towards the black king.   this is a perfect example of how, if you do not punish your opponents' mistakes right away, they may end up doing a pretty convincing impression of good moves! white could have had a clear advantage last turn, but now the initiative is shifting over to black. this is a step in the right direction for white — the queen supports a future e4 (which is even more important a move than before, now that there's that barrier on f5 to break down) while allowing nbd2 without dropping the e-pawn. ? after a strong, purposeful move, black falters. sure, …g5 must have seemed a tempting plan. with the king still in the center and 4 pieces undeveloped, however, a pawn storm is a bit unrealistic. …be7 followed by castling was indicated. in the case of h3, black is happy to play …nf6 and add more control to e4. ? hasty. white could have played e4 here, to open the center to devastating effect. instead, white is trading off one of only three pieces that are doing anything, in exchange for a knight who had no hope of otherwise participating in the game for a long time to come. (the action is all in the center and on the kingside, and the nc6 has no easy way to get there — all it does is block the bb7.) ! the correct knight to trade, even if it does involve a sacrifice. ! bold and uncompromising! as long as white has decided to allow a knight to g4, might as well give it some company. black is now starting to really play with a plan. not great, but what else could white play? g3 might have actually been safer — even though white's light squares look awful, there is no obvious way to break through. ! that's more like it! now black is playing with a purpose, and the attack comes from seemingly out of nowhere. note that, while black's dsb and qr do not play, every one of white's queenside pieces might as well be decoration. well-intentioned — black is trying to open new lines of attack in the center while making square for the dsb. i think that either …nh6 followed by …g5-g4, or else …0-0-0 with the same sacrifices as in the game would be more accurate, however. ?! the idea is great — an attack on the wing should be met by a counterattack in the center. white should further his/her development with the tempo-gaining nf3 first, though — right now, the queen is the only piece that is at all set up to attack in the center.  note that white correctly refrains from hxg4, since after …hxg4, there would be no defense to black's attack down the h-file. consistent, breaking down white's center. given that both players have neglected their own development and central play so blatantly during the opening, black is actually able to play this line-opening move with an uncastled king and get away with it — but please, don't try this at home, folks! at last! this move was just begging to be played. a sensible retreat, holding the center. ?? nope, this move is still bad.  instead, nxe5 qxg5 18. nxg4+ (white could go after the rook with ng6+, but that seems risky; of course nf3+ fails to …qe7) …qe7 ne5 keeps a slight edge for white. ! even better than hxg4, since it reduces white's counterplay. ? now is no time to get timid. ne5! (e.g. …qxg5 19. bb5+ intending rxf5) would have kept an initiative for white. ? not to the point. ne5! was still the best. ! brave, though black had little choice. of course, qc7+ is not as threatening as it may seem, since white has to deal with the mate threat and has no time to grab the bishop. ?? this doesn't actually deal with the mate threat, however. either g3 or rf2 would have kept the game going. then …bd6 is practically forced, and we'll exchange off into a very favorable endgame for black. ke1/e3 leads to …qe2 mate.  although the opening had some glaring innacuracies, the middlegame more than made up for it with some exciting back-and-forth play. 
-------------------------------------
il aurait peut être fallu protéger f4 là belle connerie de ma part... j'ai même pas trop de raison d'amener là la cavalerie, c'est juste quej'aime bien avoir les cavaliers dans le centre en début de partie... alors là c'est pire, j'aurais du jouer bd2 merde ma dame! le salop! attention! si ton fou est protégé par le cavalier en b8, si je mange axb4, ma tour menace le cavalier! en plus je menace aussi bxc2. bref c'est la fête. ce qui devait arriver est arrivé... ah la poufiasse veut jouer aussi! je protege mon pion et menace d5 ok, tu veux un échange? j'ai l'impression d'avoir l'avantage, j'accepte l'échange j'avais repéré c7 qui faisait une fourchette si je plaçais mon cavalier là, et j'avais envie d'affaiblir un éventuel petit roque. ma fourchette, je m'offre une tour. là, je vais pas te laisser ton pion aller au bout quand même! au début je comptais jouer bd4, et puis j'ai vu ça. je garde en échec histoire de voir ce que je peux faire avec mes 3 pièces et là tu m'offres un cadeau. e8 m'aurait fait chier quand même... mais bon, la partie était pliée. bien joué le début de partie padre!

i have been asked to annotate this game, which is quite interesting. i play a sacrifice, which may not be the best move in the position, but it throws my opponent off track. he doesn't find the best defence and loses quickly, in just 17 moves. so my trusted sicilian defence the usual reply and the same from me. 3. d4 is more common, but this is often played by players of michael's standard so i blunt the scope of his bc4 he continues to develop i threaten to drive the bc4 back. this is actually given as a mistake by the post-match computer, but it is the most common move. he wisely prevents this. so i continue to develop this is a mistake. you shouldn't move pieces twice in the opening without a good reason. it is not given as a mistkae by the post-match computer, although its assessment of the position changes from slight advantage for white to slight advantage to black. so i advance in the centre. he takes i take back he castles, i develop he develops and so do i. he now needs to develop his queen side, maybe with b3 followed by bb2, but he plays..... this exchanges off his best protector of the white king side. so i take he takes back i improve the position of my bishop he retreats and i sac. i am not sure that this is the best move, but i was very certain my opponent would not find the best reply. taking is the best chance i continue to attack although this looks daft, it may well be the best chance post-match computer analysis gives this as a mistake and gives the line… h5 15. rh1 qd6+ 16. f4 g5 17. ne2 h4+ 18. kf3 c4 19. bh7+ kxh7 20. fxg5 nh2+ 21. kf2 bg4 22. kg1 bxe2 23. qxe2. is qd6 really a mistake? what do you think dear reader?

défense marshall... j'ai l'impression que ce coup sort de la théorie... fe7 me semble préférable pour un meilleur contrôle du centre. peut-être pour empêcher cb5. mais il aurait été préférable de le placer directement en b7, en fianchetto, ce qui est une position classique et bien protégée, derrière les pions. de plus cela donne du poids sur la grande diagonale h1-a8 et sur le centre je continue le développement classique et il me reste le fou c1 à sortir + la dame, pour que le développement de début de partie soit fini pour les blancs, il reste alors au moins 3 coups à effectuer pour les noirs : le roque + le cavalier cb8 + la dame à sortir..... pas bon, car bloque la possibilité de pousser le pion c7 ou  de sortir ici le cavalier cb8. se place sur la grande diagonale mais en 2 coups au lieu de 1 et avec une position inférieure. placement de la tour sur la colonne c, position typique des blancs dans les gambits dames fin du développement noir, mais avec un peu de retard et avec une position problématique au niveau du fou fc6 début des hostilités sur l'aile dame, et/ou échange du cavalier pour briser la paire de fous. la colonne c m'appartient, la paire de fous noirs est cassée, ça me va... bon coup, dans la stratégie logique des noirs de trouver du contre jeu au centre/ aile roi pour répondre à l'attaque des blancs sur l'aile dame. idée de se placer sur la diagonale qui pointe sur le roi, et de libérer la ligne 1 pour éventuellement doubler les tours sur la colonne c le jeu adéquat je ne suis pas sur de la qualité de ce coup, car s'il a l'avantage de garder le fou sur la colonne qui pointe sur l'aile roi, mais limite l'action du fou sur un seul côté. peut-être plus de poids en e2. la position s'égalise, les blancs n'ont pas su attaquer sur l'aile dame, peut-être pour avoir pointé les fous sur l'aile roi... je pense que c'est l'erreur stratégique : le plan naturel des noirs est d'attaquer sur l'aile roi, ouvrir ainsi sur l'aile dame remet le plan d'attaque des blancs en selle. le pion d5 est isolé, la dame est en face de la tour td1... le piège ! car le pion d5 est perdu aïe ! les noirs perdent une pièce mineure. permet d'éviter de perdre les pions du centre, et casse le roque noir. il ne reste plus qu'à gérer l'avance de matériel pour les blancs en échangeant au max. et les noirs sont un peu obligés de le faire... toutefois le travail n'est pas fini et les noirs savent bien trouver du contre-jeu en position d'infériorité. mauvais coup qui aide le jeu noir. idéalement, df3 aurait été mieux. du coup, obligé de réagir... ...et de réagir encore bon coup qui va nécessairement mettre en difficulté les noirs, soit avec l'échange des dames, soit en fixant un pion blanc en f6, idéal pour un mat... encore du contre-jeu, les blancs ne doivent pas mollir.... ce coup tolère la perte du pion a4 car si la dame prend, les noirs vont au mat. aïe. tous les chemins mènent à mat. une des suites possible....

so this was another game against one of the lovely ladies from the sixth sense gameknot team. so it starts conventionally she continues with the main line. i develop too. playing the sicilian a bit like a spanish opening - it is not a bad plan. i prepare to support nc6 with ng-e7 she castles i continue with my plan. she move her rook to a more active square. i hit the bishop. she takes. i take back, opening up the squares e7 and maybe even d6 for my bf8. she opens the centre. i take. she takes back. i have a slight weakness on d6, but on the other hand i have good control over f5, e5, d5 and c5. chances are about equal. she continues to develop. i prepare to castle. she takes. i take back. this is her reason for exchanging - she couldn't play this move before as otherwise her nd4 would be hanging. protecting g7 is a bit of a problem. this anti-developing move is a mistake. kf8 was probably best. we are both following bertholee, rob (2340) vs. amesz, jaap (2185) which ended in a draw. white threatens to place her bishop on b2, adding to the pressure on g7 so i block the long diagonal, and open up an attack on her queen. she retreats to the best square, maintaining the pressure on g7. laura is playing this very well so far. with no easy way of developing my king side i decide to develop my bc8. now in bertholee, rob (2340) vs. amesz, jaap (2185) the bishop came out to a3, so i was now thinking for myself. played with the idea of playing bf8-e7, without leaving my g7 pawn hanging. she continues to mobilize. laura continues to play well, and has a slight edge here. i continue with my plan. laura finally puts her bishop on its best square, adding to the pressure on d6. so i protect d6 again. she prepares to swing  a rook over to the king side. i castle. she prepares to redevelop her bishop. the post match computer analysis (pmca) doesn't like this, and prefers 18. qe3 qh4 19. qb6 c5 20. nd5 bxd5 21. exd5 rb8 22. qa7 ra8 23. qd7 rad8 24. qf5 qg5 25. qxg5 bxg5 as best for both sides. pmca doesn't like this move either, and prefers … rd7 19. red1 rfd8 20. be3 rb7 21. a3 a5 22. kh1 h5 23. h4 qxh4+ 24. qxh4 bxh4 25. rxd6 rbd7 26. rxd7 rxd7 27. rxd7 bxd7 this is a bit of a wild thrust. pmca still likes 19. qe3 with rb8 20. ba3 c5 21. nd5 bxd5 22. rxd5 qg6 23. qd3 rb6 24. rd1 qg4 25. qc4 kh8 26. bb2 bh4 to follow. this is a mistake too - i should have just taken on h4. now she forces me to take! white is just a clear pawn down now. she takes. i take back. she very cleverly now starts probing my weaknesses on the queen side.  i move my bishop back to a safer square. she redirects her bishop, also at my weak black squares on the queen side. my plan is to advance d6-d5, but i want to make sure e5 is firmly protected first. so she hits my rook. this is the only square it can go to. she makes d6-d5 harde - this is an excellent move! but i decide to play it anyway. her knight comes in. my rook shuffles up the board again. since dropping the pawn, the lovely laura has played really well, but this just drops another pawn. which i snatch off, opening up the d file for my rook too. she goes after my c pawn. i decide i can't protect that pawn, so i try to exchange her active bishop. this is a mistake too - far better to exchange bishops and take on c4. sp now i protect c4 and i am just two pawns up.  this is a good move attacking my rook. so i advance it, threatening a2. she protects a2, but pmca prefers 31. ra3 a5 32. bxa5 bxa5 33. nc3 bxc3 34. rcxc3 rb8 35. ra6 rd3 36. rc2 rc8 37. rb6 kf7 38. a4 rd1+ 39. kh2 rcd8 40. a5 so i try again to exchange that powerful bishop of hers. this is another mistake dropping the a pawn for no compensation. so i take. she takes. i take back. her knight comes in. and my bishop drops back. with three pawns down and no compensation, she resigned. many thanks for reading, please rate this on the star system and leave a comment or two! until next time dear reader!

-------------------------------------
my opponent says he has had better luck with d4 openings. my standard response, prevents (usually e4), develops my knight. aggressive, it seems to me! this is my typical next move, prepares for d5, slows down white's pawns.  he has taken the center. the game db really liked h6 here.  maybe i should have done that, but i decided to develop more methodically with be7, enabling castling. i was probably too conservative here. white is aggressive!  he puts the question to my knight. this was not in the database (game db). white must take.  the queen re-takes.  white probably challenges my knight with nd2.  my opponent, who likes daring moves, would probably like me to sacrifice my knight at f2, bring my queen to h4 and start an attack.  white should be able to take the center pawns; so i'd be down only a pawn. it would teach white a lesson for pushing pawns so early in the game, which he cannot easily support if i act quickly and with daring. hmmmm. white surprises me!  i don't win his piece, because the black knight has nowhere to go after h4.  i will attack his center with c5, and win his rook pawn on g5.  this promises to be a wild game, but first i must oblige him and take his bishop with my knight. even after white's h4, black has the better game. more than equality.  so white is playing tactics here, counting on an error and a fierce attack to win the day.  i expect h4.  i will counterplay in the center with c5, ultimately taking white's d pawn and opening avenues for my queen to get in on the fun, maybe with qa5+, or qb6, qb4+.  alternatively, my knight moves back to e4, lets the bishop take him, then pushes d5; white takes en passant, exd6, cxd6, and black ends up with a nice center, good development, the bishop pair, maybe also white's kr pawn, though that gives white some attacking chances. still, it seems as if white should be punished more.  hmmmm. another surprise. developing my knight. i expected to lose the knight, to the h pawn, to the f pawn, or to the bishop on d3. this is the harder pawn to capture. if qg4, then either nc6, or nxc2+, exchanging the knight for the rook or maybe ultimately winning it.  it will be hard to white to keep the g- and e-pawns now.  his attacking chances will soon peter out (i hope!). i think he needed to develop a piece, nc3 or nf3.  if he was worried about bb4+, i'd have to prepare to avoid a fork of my knight and bishop.  he does not have time for this move.  i suppose he might have tried h5, or at some point even g6.  he'd lose the pawn anyway and he could mess up my pawn structure. maybe 9. exd6, qxd6, but my opponent might have a more aggressive play in mind. no great moves here, but i would have developed a piece, like nf3. black sits well. white will likely exchange pawns, and black has a nice strong center, and at least one pawn up. i had expected exd6. but my opponent explained that he wanted to castle and put pressure on f7, which explains why he did not post his knight on f3.  but . . . are his attacking chances worth the pawn he gave up on e5?  of course, i don't think so.  but time will tell. white is down two. why not nd2 or bc2? i might as well take my pawn now on g5. my thinking is simply to develop my pieces, occupy the center. i expect to then move my queenside pawns down the board, with moves like a5, c5, b4, qb6, bb7 or bd7, supported by my center. i will be eager to exchange pawns and pieces so that my relative advantage becomes proportionally bigger. i take the pawn. hmmm.  what is my opponent thinking? i see that if i take the bishop that white's queen will check me soon on h5.  and white's knight is nearby.  is a mating net forming?  is the bishop "poisoned"?  should i take it?  or hide at h8?  analyze tells me i can take the bishop and withstand the attack. maybe if white had more pieces in play . . . his chances would be better. i take, living dangerously, but also using the "analyze" feature, which showed me that white's attack soon would fizzle out. white's queen strikes with 'check!' my bishop blocks the queen.  ha ha probably repositioning for g5+. but better would be nd2 to get the knight in the game, the queen rook, too. i develop my bishop.  the threat seems parried and i'm up a piece and two pawns. white develops his knight (finally). developing a piece, threatening the rook. c4?  black is eager to exchange pieces given that black is ahead, and black's relative advantage will be greater with fewer pieces on the board.  this is simple math.  like 5/3 is less that 3/1.  get it?  white has no great place for his rook (e1 maybe), which is threatened. black initiates an exchange. white prepares for another sally against the black king's position, focusing on f7. black establishes control of the center and provides a space for its knight to position itself to d6, to protect f7.  black's knight can easily reposition at d6 to protect  against white's threats at f7.  what is white up to? doubling the rooks on the f file?  knight to g5+, with pressure on black's f pawn? [but black's queen would take the knight.] can black defend f3? of course, black's king retreat to g8 provides another defender for f7, and frees the bishop to attack g5. opening the f or g file could work for black, opening the game, with black's superior forces. white is up to attack f7. black protects f7. white might be thinking of rh5. but there's no time.  g6 forces the white queen to move. white lets its rook and queen be threatened with g5.  white should have moved to e5. winning a piece or forcing an exchange and winning a pawn.  more importantly, black is happy to exchange pieces to simplify and get to the endgame. white elects to exchange. black is eager to exchange, so that its relative advantage increases.  remember, this is simple math.  white has three major pieces to black's five, with the relative points being 26 for black and 20 for white.  that's an advantage of 26/20= 1.3.  i omitted the pawns for simplicity, though black is two pawns up.  if white exchanges its queen for the two rooks (and a pawn), the relative advantage becomes 16/10, or 1.6 -- a greater advantage for black. black exchanges for the reason mentioned earlier, increasing its relative advantage. my opponent thought i had made a mistake, . . . but i think not! white is down 9.  he really has no good moves left. but he has a lot of energy.  another attack? black control the center, with its bishop defended and in a central position. ?  but what can he do?   black marshalls its rooks on the open file.  nimsovitsch advised to seize the open file. the white king must be mated. soon the knight will come up to help seal the deal. this is the beginning of the end. white just has his queen. against two rooks, a bishop and knight, black's center and supporting pawns. always attacking. black can spare a few pawns to create a mating net. white grabs a pawn, having nothing better.  but he knows the end is near. this is nice isn't it? the queen is directly attacked, and the king threatened. this looks aggressive, but helps me solidify my constellation of attacking pieces and pawns. isn't this nice? everything is protecting each other. white can pick off a few more pawns on the queen's side of the board, but mate is coming on the other side of the board. the queen is munching on my pawns! i give up the pawns for a mate, which feels certain now. the queen rook gets the assignment so my king can be protected from checks. her last attack. the king is safe from any harassment here. the king's  move doesn't help and makes the mate faster.  the king moves forward.  this is like "death by cop."  ke1 prolongs the agony.  but mate is inevitable.  for fun, i anticipated every reasonable move, and a few unreasonable ones, and programmed them as conditional moves.   34. ke1 rdxg2 35. qxa7 bg3# edit • delete	 34. ke1 rdxg2 35. qxe5+ bxe5 edit • delete	 34. kg1 rgxg2+ 35. kh1 rd1# edit • delete	 34. kf3 rg3# edit • delete	 34. ke1 rdxg2 35. qxe5+ bxe5 36. a4 bg3# edit • delete	 34. ke1 rdxg2 35. qxe5+ bxe5 36. b3 bg3# edit • delete	 34. ke1 rdxg2 35. qxe5+ bxe5 36. b4 bg3# edit • delete	 34. ke1 rdxg2 35. qxe5+ bxe5 36. h6 bg3#  * * *  this opponent has a fun, aggressive style.  but he'll win more games using the analyze feature, and 'flip' to see the board like his opponent does.  using the game db feature may help his opening. getting your pieces developed before an attack is often helpful.  attacks that work in over the board chess often fail in correspondence chess where time pressure is almost nonexistent and the analyze feature enables players to play out positions. he chooses a quick death. we both had fun! 
-------------------------------------
pirc defense - thematic game common line white quitly reinforces his center white king in safe in the pirc, black, usually attacks white' kingside preventing 8.d5 to prepare a baïonnet attack to prepare a further c5 white masses a huge amount of material in the center this could have wait, 9. c5 or 9. bb7 might  have been better but i was afraid of 10. bh6 to open the diagonal for the queen and/or prepare  a further nf4 i estimate that it's hard time to attack the queenside as the many pieces white has but d4 is overprotected. providing an escape for the lsb now comes the bayonet attack black attack had better to be strong because of the many troops, white has massed toward the black king closing the game. i didn't see what else i could do. it closes the game but white is better on the center and has all his lesser pieces and the queen aiming at black's  castle white plaid very well until now and has positionnal advantage !? i felt cramped and thought, i had to do something. it's a mistake of course? maybe due to lack of patience... at least, the pawn exchange has released pressure on f6 white attacks mistake, black is in trouble this  the black king is weak and black is in late of material. the 2 good things are  that black has a better control on the center and can quickly bring all his reserves to protect the king. adding pressure black has to bring as many pieces as possible to protect the king. to fire the g knight the rook will soon come to g3 or h3 so that the a rook can come on a7 to protect g7 one more piece toward g6 some more air but black is still besieged protecting g7 blunder. now black is no longer in late of material but still besieged it's verdun ! and to break the siege, the allied drove a strong attack on the somme. so that i plan a counterattack on the right wing to force white to remove his lsb from the b1 h7 diagonal white defends the queenside carrying on the attack to force the lsb to leave the diagonal black's plan is now to get rid of the dangerous e knight  protecting the knight menacing 31. nf5 with fork attack on both rook and queen but the bishop is back ! the counterattack failed king off the g file and on a black square to attack the unprotected bishop the lsb is away ! now, black's counters the situation is very complicated now but black has massed almost all his pieces in front of his king and white is outnumbered. in the following trade, black will probably lose some material but black is in advance and firing the e knight is worth a pawn. beginning of a massacre first trade second trade now white is only one pawn down but black's position is better  attaking the unprotected pawn if the c pawn falls, the d pawn will follow and black will get one passed pawn. i didn't understand the point of this move the pawn is taken! black will get 2 passed pawns attacking the rook and blocking the passed c pawn in this position and with material advantage, i estimate that the trade was valuable for black white's d pawn can wait, it is doomed anyway to attack the d pawn and prevent the king to come on help fork attack the trade seems to be good for black now the white king has to stay on d3 or e2 the pawns must be attacked from behind white is doomed,  white resigns here, for he is almost in zugzwang (he can only play kc2 or kd3 cannot prevent the black king to come on g3 and take the pawns one by one

rather non-standard. computer identifies this as an inaccuracy, and prefers 3. ... g6  not 5. ba4 b5 6. bb3 c4. not 5. bd3 (cramps position). be2 is probably playable. this is one of 2 possible ways of activating the c1 bishop. the other alternative, which is more cramping, is b3. note that d3 is not a good option due to the threat of b5. ! retreating the bishop may be safer, but this forces black to deal with white's advantage in the center. computer identifies this as an inaccuracy, preferring 8. ... ne5 as a way of drawing in more pieces. not 9. nxd4? cxd4 losing a piece.  computer analysis prefers 9. e5 ng4 10. d6 qc6 11. bd3 f5 12. bf4 bb7 13. h3 nxf3+ 14. qxf3 qxf3 15. gxf3 nh6 16. a4 c4, which gives white a slight space advantage at the cost of doubled pawns on the f file and no good place for the light-squared bishop. ? black doesn't have time for this - 9. ... nxe2 or nxf3+ is needed. a key pawn is now gone, and white has the upper hand. it's up to black to prove that he can recover, otherwise white will trade down to a won endgame. still leaves the bc1 somewhere to go. black must get the king off of the line of fire, otherwise white will force a queen trade with qe2. ?! unclear why black is attacking white's strongest point here. f5, g5, h5, f4, g3, and h2 are all covered.  computer significantly prefers 16. … qd4 17. qxd4 bxd4 18. a3 rfe8 19. rxe8+ rxe8 20. re1 rxe1+ 21. bxe1 d6 22. bd2 bxc3 23. bxc3 bxd5 24. be2 be4 25. bxf6 gxf6 which leads directly to a fairly even endgame, with a slight advantage to white caused by black's doubled and more scattered pawns. forced - there's no other way to defend h2. the computer identifies this as an inaccuracy, preferring 18. … rfe8 19. a4 b4 20. ne4 be5 21. bxb4 bxd5 22. c3 bxe4 23. bxe4 nxe4 24. rxe4 a5 25. bxa5 qxb2 26. qxd7. this would have liquidated the queenside, leaving white with only an advantage of the a-pawn. black may be better off here allowing white to trade. ! forces black to trade off another piece, and threatens d7. ? nf6 is better here. (computer agrees with me) and now white has a passed pawn. i think black is trying to bait white into dxc6. no dice. computer prefers 24. … g6 25. qd4 rd6 26. rfe1 rfd8 27. re6 rxe6 28. rxe6 nxd5 29. nxd5 bxd5 30. re8+ rxe8 31. bxd5+ re6 32. bxa8, but in any event black is in a pretty lousy position by now. this allows the d5 pawn to move. computer analysis prefers 25. qxf5 bb7 26. qg5 rd6 27. rfe1 rf7 28. re7 qf8 29. rxf7 qxf7 30. re6 qf8 31. bg2 kh8 which protects the bishop by eventually playing bg2. not 26. rxf5 bg6 winning the rook. however, the computer notes that this really shouldn't have worked, and better would have been 26. rd1 bd7 27. d6 qb8 28. nd5 kh8 29. ne7 rfe8 30. qd4 ng4 31. bxg4 fxg4 32. rde1 qb7+ 33. kg1. black should not have tried to force the immediate recapture. 26. … nd7 27. rxe8 rfxe8 28. d6 qb8 29. qd5+ kh8 30. rd1 nb6 31. qb7 qxb7 32. bxb7 nc4 33. d7 re7 34. bxa6 rexd7 reduces white's advantage significantly. white has to recapture with the bishop, otherwise he loses the queen for a rook. according to the computer, white could have pounced very nicely by playing 27. rxe8 rfxe8 28. bxd5+ rxd5 29. nxd5 qc6 30. rd1 a5 31. qd3 re6 32. rd2 kh8 33. qf3 re8 34. ne3 qc7 35. nd5, which would have given a piece advantage. the key move of this sequence, sorta-pinning the d5 rook against a8. ?? loses a piece. correct play is rd8 offering a queen trade. (computer agrees with me on this) otherwise white will hammer black's back-rank weakness. white will now force off both of black's rooks, preventing any sort of counterplay. ? this accomplishes nothing. black has no winning chances whatsoever from here. he might have played on looking for a stalemate. computer suggests white was playing it safer than he needed to: 41. kh4 kg8 42. rxh6 gxh6 43. kxh5 accomplishes the same goal, but with an extra couple of pawns to show for it. forces the creation of a queenside passed pawn. now black has no way to prevent a promotion. black's best chance, and it's a bad one, is to make a run for the queenside with his king while staying close enough to f8 to stop white if he goes that way. this could have been the start of some clever maneuvering by black, but he chooses not to follow through. a viable option would be to make a run for c2 threatening to promote on b1. it's a long shot, but the best he has. ?? this is either giving up, or hoping for a stalemate. ? missed an easy one: qh8# missed another one: 54. qe7+ kh6 55. f6 kg6 56. qg7# missed it again: 55. qe7+ kh6 56. f6 kg6 57. qg7#

pourquoi jouer le fou sur cette position ? c'est une perte de temps énorme les blancs font n'importe quoi. l'échange cavalier dame récupère gagne le pion et le temps sur l'attaque en g7 tu vois tu as perdu un temps à jouer le fou ici alors que le mettre directement eut été préférable pourquoi le jouer ici ?? le cavalier perd beaucoup trop de temps et est complètement inefficace le preuve la structure est brisée hum les blancs ont raté le coup du jeu : pion prend échec, puis dame prend dame, la partie est pliée beaucoup trop d'erreurs dans cette partie. ramika est très certainement under rated (bon j'ai perdu pas mal de points ces derniers temps mais j'ai l'habitude de jouer à 1700 et des poussières) 
-------------------------------------
typical move for a reason. this move controls the centre and gets the queen and bishop ready for action. i don't see how this helps with development. does anyone know? again, not a developing move. i have heard that it is a bad idea to do nc3 after d4. why? knights are almost always best when pointing towards the centre. i decide to target the f-pawn. at this point, one would say that white is much more able to launch an attack, though white would be unwise to attack without much support. i castle, putting my king into a safer position (which is generally the aim of castling). is this ok, or is bf4 better? ? free pawn. skewering my bishop to b2. is this the best move? as i feared after pressing 'submit' on move 6. aiming for liquidation, but is this a bad move, because it trades a bishop for a badly placed knight and allows the dsb a more active role in the game? better would be bxh6. trying to give my knight on f3 attacking space. is this ok? dxe6 is illegal, as d7 is pinned. check. my bishop still has time to move. bxa6 is probably better, due to rxb2. why this move? ? i had an irrational fear of a pawn storm, which is why i did this. ?? loses a knight, as you will see. black resigned here, facing either bxa6 (winning the knight) or qxg6+ (forking the king and rook). feel free to comment and offer constructive criticism, and i hope that you learned something! 😄 
-------------------------------------
partie en mode coaching. peu de choses à dire jusqu'ici. relativement bien joué des deux côtés. les deux côtés ont des pions faibles, mais celui des blancs en b4 l'est particulièrement parce qu'il est sur une colonne ouverte, ce qui constitue une faiblesse plus permanente. les pions doublés noirs sont faibles mais peuvent plus difficilement être attaqués en permanence. abandonne la pression sur le pion e6 pour se concentrer sur la défense du pion b4. un plan probablement valable, mais pas suffisamment agressif. les blancs s'alignent vers une position défensive. est-ce la bonne stratégie? les deux côtés ne veulent évidemment pas échanger les tours et donner la colonne ouverte à l'adversaire. ici, les noirs attaquent tout de suite la principale faiblesse des blancs. ceci est vraiment trop défensif. il fallait tenter tour en a6 et conserver le seul avantage des blancs, la colonne a. le pion b4 étant si faible, aussi bien s'en débarrasser et au moins obtenir du contre-jeu. menace de doubler les tours. les blancs n'ont pratiquement pas le choix de doubler aussi, mais les tours seront dans une position purement défensive. les noirs décident de s'emparer de la colonne ouverte avec menace de tour en a4 ce qui renouvelle la double attaque sur le pion b4 mais avec une tour plus active en a4. ceci est une position purement défensive pour les blancs. reste aux noirs à en profiter ce qui n'est pas si facile. voyons s'ils réussiront à percer. un coup inutile basé sur le mirage que la dame pouvait prendre le pion f après la poussée du pion g. une erreur sans conséquence dans ce genre de position fermée où les blancs sont en défensive. quelle stratégie adopter pour les noirs? qu'est ce que la position révèle? le pion faible en b4 force les blancs à conserver au moins deux pièces à sa protection. le grand atout des noirs est le pion passé en d4. mais comment l'exploiter? un coup qui risque de donner des idées aux noirs d'ouvrir le côté roi. idée qui peut sembler farfelue, mais compte tenu de la position défensive des blancs, pourrait bien réussir. l'idée des blancs est peut-être justement de faire cela aussi, mais je crois que c'est une stratégie qui pourrait être avantageuse aux noirs (le roi blanc devient très vulnérable vis à vis la tour noire en a4). les tours appartiennent sur la 7ème rangée, qu'ils disent dans les livres de théorie. évidemment. évidemment aussi. nécessaire si les blancs ne veulent pas échanger les tours. la pression noire commence à se faire sentir. pratiquement forcé. finalement la poussée du pion g blanc va être utile aux noirs. perd un pion. mais c'est peut-être le seul coup qui permet encore aux blancs d'espérer un peu de contre-jeu. maintenant, il n'y a plus de mirage. la dame attaque vraiment le pion f, en plus de la menace sur le pion b. il fallait continuer avec la logique du coup précédent et jouer a6. la position blanche commence à s'écrouler, sans chance de contre-jeu. coup difficile à comprendre. panique ou peut-être mauvaise journée au bureau ou maux d'estomac? roi en h2 était possible et tenait le fort du moins pour quelques coups encore. mi ni mi ni mai ni mo! on prend celui-ci. les noirs commencent à faiblir. prendre l'autre pion était meilleur, avec trois pions passés, un vrai bulldozer. les noirs auraient pu continuer sans échanger les dames (c'aurait été la meilleure stratégie), mais les noirs décident pour une fin de partie pépère avec deux pions en plus (esprit d'aventure déficient ici, mais sans excuse de mauvaise journée au bureau, les noirs faisant partie de la catégorie des gens à la retraite qui ont beaucoup de temps pour jouer aux échecs). probablement le plus simple. créer un deuxième pion passé devrait mener à la victoire. ici les blancs ont abandonné. ils auraient pu essayer la poussée du pion b. si les noirs reprennent avec la tour, les blancs ont des chances d'annuler dans une position fascinante avec dame contre dame. mais en reprenant avec le pion, la victoire des noirs ne fait pas de doute. 
-------------------------------------
  coup du lance-guépard coup de la banane séchée coup du clou de girofle  coud du flamand dodu coup de la girafe albinos 
-------------------------------------
 il nero adotta una difesa solida. il pregio di questa mossa è che il pedone e5 è difeso da un altro pedone, quindi non potrà essere catturato facilmente. il difetto è che l'alfiere f8 avrà qualche difficoltà ad essere sviluppato perchè la diagonale f8-a3 è bloccata.
-------------------------------------
  una continuazione molto logica: il bianco non ha paura di spingere in d4 poichè il pedone è difeso sia dalla donna che dal cavallo. inoltre così facendo ha aperto la strada ad entrambi gli alfieri. è corretto riprendere col cavallo.
-------------------------------------
 5. nc3 sembra più naturale prepara l'arrocco questa ritirata dell'alfiere in h5 è dubbia. da qui ed eventualmente da g6 questo alfiere non giocherà molto perchè i pedoni bianchi f3 e e4 sono molto solidi e ne ostruiranno il raggio d'azione.
-------------------------------------
 tuttavia bisogna stare attenti a lanciare in avanti i pedoni perchè una volta mossi non possono più tornare indietro: qui il pedone c5 abbandona il fratello in d6, ne consegue che quest'ultimo, senza altri suoi simili che lo difendono, diventa un punto debole. inoltre la mossa c5 indebolisce anche la casa d5, poichè ora potrebbe venire occupata da un cavallo bianco e non c'è più a disposizione la spinta liberatrice c6 (che sarebbe invece stata disponibile se il pedone c fosse rimasto in c7). il cavallo si posiziona in un ottima casa. da qui minaccia molte case importanti dello schieramento avversario (d6,e7,g7,h6).
-------------------------------------
 paradossalmente la posizione del nero sarebbe più solida se avesse saltato la nona mossa (quindi se avese ancora il pedone in c7). attacca il forte cavallo in f5 cambiare un cavallo per un alfiere è spesso una buona cosa, perchè la coppia di alfieri nel finale è superiore alla coppia di cavalli.
-------------------------------------
 è pur vero che qui il cavallo in f5 era molto forte strategicamente. ma va anche detto che il nero minacciava comunque di cambiarlo catturando con l'alfiere g6, quindi tutto sommato questa presa di cavallo ci può stare.
-------------------------------------
  minaccia la donna di nuovo il bianco ha posizionato un cavallo in una casa strategicamente importante e per il nero sarà dura rimuoverlo (sempre a causa della mossa 9...c5, che ha reso debole la casa d5). inchioda il cavallo il nero reagisce cercando di cambiare il cavallo d5 o l'alfiere d3 il bianco vuole mantenere la coppia degli alfieri.
-------------------------------------
 salvo rare eccezioni avere un impedonatura è una debolezza perchè risulta più difficile difendere tali pedoni dagli attacchi avversari, inoltre il pedone in coda è immobilizzato rimuovendo il forte cavallo da d5 libera il cavallo f6 dall'inchiodatura e minaccia il pedone in b2, nonchè lo scacco di scoperta con c4+ difende il pedone, ma a mio avviso era preferibile prendere in f6 per rovinare la struttura pedonale avversaria come si può notare d5 è una casa dominata dal bianco.
-------------------------------------
 ma il bianco ha rischiato. mossa dubbia. il nero sacrifica la qualità. forse una svista?
-------------------------------------
 n.b. perdere o sacrificare la "qualità" vuol dire perdere o sacrificare la torre in cambio di un alfiere o un cavallo. si dice così perchè pur essendo invariato il numero di pezzi, il giocatore che ha ceduto la torre per un cavallo o alfiere ha un pezzo di qualità inferiore.
-------------------------------------
 altri modi di dire sono "pezzi pesanti" con cui si intende solitamente donne o torri, mentre "pezzi leggeri" con cui si intende alfieri e cavalli. con l'intenzione di attaccare la donna. in realtà indebolisce la struttura pedonale a difesa del re perchè apre la diagonale a2-g8 a potenziali scacchi. mette al sicuro la donna.
-------------------------------------
 (una colonna si dice aperta quando non vi sono più pedoni, semi-aperta quando vi sono solo pedoni avversari; spesso è strategicamente ottimale mettere le torri su colonne aperte, o, se non ce ne sono, su colonne semiaperte; da cui ne consegue che quella del nero è una buona mossa; il bianco invece al posto della dubbia mossa che sta per fare avrebbe dovuto occupare la colonna d con una torre) poco chiara.
-------------------------------------
 una batteria di pezzi molto tipica è quella di avere, ad esempio usando il bianco, l'alfiere in c2 e la donna in d3 minacciando il matto in h7. attacca il pedone "e" mossa molto utile.
-------------------------------------
  questo scacco è inutile e dannoso. inutile perchè il nero può difendersi contrattaccando (25...bf7), dannoso perchè il bianco perde l'occasione di ricatturare il pedone e4.
-------------------------------------
 forse il nero avendo la qualità in meno, preferisce mantenere in vita la sua unica torre. il bianco chiarisce il motivo della mossa 23.re3: il suo scopo era raddoppiare le torri. niente male.
-------------------------------------
 mossa dubbia perchè consente al pedone e4 del nero di diventare un pedone passato.
-------------------------------------
 un pedone passato è un pedone che non ha nè un pedone avversario sulla propria colonna che possano ostacolarlo, nè pedoni avversari sulle colonne adiacenti alla propria che lo possano minacciare in caso di avanzata.
-------------------------------------
 se ben sostenuto un pedone passato può diventare un arma formidabile perchè minaccia di arrivare a promozione e già solo per questa minaccia costringe l'avversario a impiegare energie per fermarlo. consolida il pedone c5 minaccia f5 l'alfiere cerca maggiore spazio. come abbiamo visto, a causa della mossa 8...bh5 questo alfiere non ha giocato molto (almeno fino ad ora) aggiunge un attaccante contro il pedone e4. il bianco ora ha tre attaccanti contro due difensori, se il nero non interviene il pedone e4 cadrà l'unica. mossa debole perchè consente al nero di creare un pedone passato in d4 con 31...d4!
-------------------------------------
 il re del bianco è abbastanza scoperto, ma per il momento i pezzi avversari non lo minacciano.
-------------------------------------
 il re del nero è ancora più scoperto del collega avversario, ma nemmeno per lui al momento sono in arrivo minacce.
-------------------------------------
 quindi la situazione per ora è quasi in perfetto in equilibrio, anche se potenzialmente le due torri del bianco fanno pensare che quest'ultimo alla fine possa prevalere. attacca la donna ed occupa la colonna aperta difende la donna attaccando la torre indifesa lo scacco al re è sempre una tentazione a cui è difficile resistere per qualsiasi giocatore terminati gli scacchi il bianco difende la torre sotto minaccia per difendere il pedone a7 cambiare i pezzi conviene al bianco perchè meno pezzi restano sulla scacchiera, più si fa sentire la differenza di qualità qui era interessante giocare 39.qd2 (minacciando lo scacco di scoperta con 40.rxe4+) a difesa della casa h4 il bianco permette al pedone di avanzare (ma se il nero lo avanza il pedone cade) cambiare i pedoni invece conviene a chi è in svantaggio di materiale quindi al nero.
-------------------------------------
 infatti poichè quando si arriva nel finale anche un solo pedone può fare la differenza (attraverso la promozione), l'ideale per chi sta sotto di una qualità come il nero, sarebbe eliminare tutti i pedoni dalla scacchiera (sia i suoi sia quelli del bianco), in questo modo il bianco ha meno opzioni per far valere la superiorità del suo materiale. il nero tenta di recupera il pedone appena offerto grazie allo scacco con questa bella combinazione il nero è riuscito nel suo intento di cambiare i pedoni il bianco vede uno scacco e non indugia ora se il bianco volesse ottenere la patta potrebbe provare a continuare a dare scacco (dopo il ripetersi per tre volte della stessa posizione sulla scacchiera, un giocatore può richiedere la patta ed ottenerla automaticamente perchè c'è una regola che lo consente) ma il bianco vuole vincere e si va a prendere un pedone.
-------------------------------------
 attenzione a questo genere di mosse. quando restano in campo le donne e pochi pezzi, andare a prendere un pedone al bordo della scacchiera è molto pericoloso perchè così facendo mette la propria donna in posizione defilata e lascia il dominio della scacchiera alla donna avversaria che può approfittarne per fare danni molto gravi.
-------------------------------------
 io ci ho perso un sacco di partite con questo genere di pedoni mangiati troppo frettolosamente la donna nera ha campo libero e prova a fare male ma il re bianco riesce per un pelo a difendere la sua amata torre l'unico modo per non perdere la torre il nero va all'attacco col re!!! e la donna bianca come per magia si sveglia dal pisolino e riapre le danze il re (insieme alla donna) minaccia la torre! la donna bianca non si avvede del pericolo e passeggia spensieratamente al centro della scacchiera (questo errore decide la partita) zàc qui il bianco poteva provare a resistere con qualche scacco, ma forse la delusione per aver perso la torre è troppa... ...e il re bianco, molto nobilmente, decide di compiere harakiri. bella partita, molto combattuta.
-------------------------------------
 il bianco è stato in vantaggio per lunghi tratti ma nel finale il nero è stato più tenace ed ha avuto la meglio.
-------------------------------------
this was a gameknot game i played. she turns it into a reversed grünfeld defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence i would have preferred a reversed king's indian defence  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence  i am playing one of the quieter ways of handling it. i suspect we are both using opening databases. i thought i may give her more problems with the queens on. so we both have recaptured the pawns. we are coming to the end of the opening databases, and gameknot post-match computer seems to think we both start making mistakes... this seems a reasonable move, seizing territory, but gameknot computer  prefers 10. bd2  and this seems reasonable, stopping the pawn from advancing again, but gameknot computer prefers … b6  and here the gameknot computer likes 11. bd2 i didn't think i had any advantage here, and the gameknot computer agrees. i wasn't too afraid of my pawns being doubled - i felt on an open board like this, the bishops are better than knights and the doubled pawns give an element of central control. in particular e5 is protected by a pawn now. this is a good move, forcing me to defend. like so. i now have a threat of nd4.  which she neatly side-steps.  so i take the queens off.  she takes back. i centralise the other rook, wondering how on earth i'm going to win this.... i advance my knight. she takes. i take back. and this retreat is the start of her problems, after the exchange she is left with weak isolated pawns on the queen-side and my rook can penetrate to the second rank. clear advantage to black now. i would guess she was afraid that 20. rab1 would lose a pawn, as i could exchange rooks and take on b2, but then her rook goes to the 7th rank and is very active - she would have had enough compensation for the pawn. so i take. she takes back. i invade. she counter-attacks b7 so i deal with that threat. presumably trying to exchange off weak queen-side pawns. so i attack it. she hits my bishop. i attack the pawn again. she pushes again. i take. i am a clear pawn up, but not only that my pieces are in dominating positions. trying to exchange pawns, or close down the king side - restrict my bishop in some way. i decide to centralise my king.  she attacks my rook. gameknot computer doesn't like move and prefers bg4 attacking his rook. fritz likes bg4 or rc7. and it doesn't like this move either. the reason was white could now do some exchanging - rook takes bishop, king takes back, then bishop check on h3 and white wins the exchange back. normally when material down, a side wants to exchange pawns but not pieces, but this position is an exception. white's bishop is a bad bishop, blocked in by the pawn on e4. we will see later exactly how bad it becomes.. black piles up on c3. white defends. threat - b4 winning another pawn.  threatening the bishop. white counter-attacks. white is still in the game. the bc8 has limited scope. and even less now. this is a dreadful move, allowing black to obtain an overwhelming position. no neither white king nor white bishop can move. this is a slight error. better c4 immediately. to stop any more advances of the king side pawns.  again, c4 immediately was called for.  this is a mistake. better was rc1 or rc2 to prevent c4. so the break comes. i break the pin on the b file. this is another mistake. white hasn't got the time to be chasing after the king side pawns. best was rc3. this pawn is coming! computer thinks rxc3 is better, but it is academic, this position is lost. i am not sure there is any need to comment on the rest. and white, about to lose the last pawn throws in the sponge.  many thanks for reading. please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
this is a game between me and my friend patagusto. i decided to annotate it since i think it is has some strategical and tactical themes. the king's gambit was one of the most important opening in the romantic age of chess. the theory teach us that accepting white's sacrifice is a better choice than refusing it with 2. ... bc5 or 2. ... d6. this is the classical line in the kga. the modern one is 3. ... d5 and is more quiet than this, which can lead to some fireworks. the muzio gambit. white is ready to sacrifice a whole piece to obtain a decisive development advantage and open lines. the e-file is now open. white's development is finished. all pieces are ready to attack, while black has "only" a material advantage. white's knight is attacking c7, threatening both the king and the rook. this simple and natural move shows how important is the coordination of pieces. black has to defend c7. the e-file will be decisive. white's increasing the pressure on it. black decides to exchange the knights. maybe 13. ... qe6 would be a stronger defense. 14. ... qxd5? is a mistake. the weakness on the c3-h8 diagonal is clearly visible. if black would try to save his rook, bf6  and then qe7#. consequent. white exploits the great dark diagonal weakness. black understimates the his weakness on h4-d8 diagonal. trying to close the e-file with the q is not enough to defend the position. perhaps moving 15. ... bg5 would be a thougher defense. white's threatens black's queen: another matter that emphasizes the mistake of 15. ... qe6? black's proposing the exchange of the queens to reduce the pressure of white's attack, but, again, is not enough. anyway, black's position is difficult. the decisive error, but the situation is compromised. it is interesting noticing the conceptual error of taking with the f pawn instead of h: without making any calculation, we can say that taking with the f pawn is an error because of the opening of the f-line. strategic principles are always important, also in tactical position! the final combination starts. forced. forced. an interesting combination between two tactical themes: the «windmill attack» (thanks to punkusmartyrus that suggested me the right word) and the «interference» (hope this is right, in italian these themes are called «vortice» and «interferenza»). with a check white gains a tempo to cancel the action of bh6 removing the threaten on pawn f4, allowing rf1 to take it.  there's nothing to do for black. it is a forced mate. if 20. ... kf8 then 21. bxh6  kg8 22. rxf4 ~ 23. rf8#. after 20. ... kf7, follows 21. rxf4 kg7 (21. ... kg8 22. bxh6 ~ 23. re8#) 22. re7  kg8 and mate in the next two moves. black resigns. a big thanks to patagusto which played this game as black!  there are some important strategic themes in this match: - the importance of development and of center; - the power of open lines; - the weakness on a1-h8 and h4-d8 diagonal; - the importance of strategy principles also in tactical situations; - tactical themes of «whirl» (a little one!) and «interference». 
-------------------------------------
apertura española (ruy-lópez). defensa siciliana. las blancas pretender debilitar la estructura de peones del adversario. dada la apacibilidad del juego, las blancas enrocan.    las negras toman ventaja en desarrollo... ...pero las blancas prosiguen en su objetivo de lograr ventaja en la estructura de peones... ...a la vez que provocan pérdida de tiempos haciendo danzar al caballo de rey. las negras siguen con ventaja en desarrollo de piezas menores y enrocan de forma ortodoxa en el 9º movimiento. con este salto de caballo se inicia un plan de gran profundidad que las negras no llegan a entrever.   ! el caballo de reina blanco culmina su carrera entregándose al rey negro como ofrenda envenenada... ... pero las negras se dejan amedrentar por la osadía del caballo blanco y no lo capturan, sospechando que a este movimiento subyace la urdimbre de una celada (a 24 ... k x n seguiría 25. qf6+ ...). un análisis minucioso muestra que el rey negro debería haber capturado al caballo, pues tendría escapatoria con ... qd8, dejando libre la celda e8. el rey negro no puedo intentar la huida atravesando f8 ya que con ne6 el rey quedaría en jake del alfil y la dama negra capturada por el caballo. así, el rey negro ha quedado confinado a un reducido habitáculo, con sus vasallos atados de pies y manos, en posiciones muy restringidas provocadas por el dominio posicional de las blancas. las blancas están en clara ventaja posicional, pero esta jugada requiere un profundo análisis ya que puede ser decisiva. y las negras abandonan ya que solo podrían demorar en un movimiento el mate (avanzando el peón g2), pues qh7 es inevitable.  
-------------------------------------
 aunque 3.ch3 me deja con algunas dudas me parece demasiado lejos del centro para ser buena. así que no veo por que no jugar 3...,d5
-------------------------------------
 despues de 4.g3 no queda más que cambiar en el centro . 5. dxe4 , crei que el blanco aun tenía chance de intentar contra juegocon 5.bg2 a lo que yo iba a jubar 5...,bd7 para luego colocar el alfil en bc6
-------------------------------------
 7.ca3 tiene truco al parecer juego 7...,bd7 para enrocar largo me parece una buena opción, la verdad no consigo ver otra opción que funcione, seguro hay otra
-------------------------------------
 7.na3 me tomó un buen tiempo darme cuenta que esta jugada tiene truco y hay que ser cuidadoso. decidí jugar bd7 para enrocar largo. me incomoda pero parece que es lo más natural hasta donde puedo ver.
-------------------------------------
 9. bf4 esta jugad ya la había visto y si no me equivoco pierde material y debe ser muy mala debid a 9...,e5
-------------------------------------
 11....,be6 la verdad no estoy seguro si cambiar el alfil en f1 era mejor. éxiste el tema de que en mayoría de material cambiar piezas y no peones es lo mejor para el lado con ventaja. pero mi sentimiento es que la posición del blanco despues del cambio de alfiles es menos complicada para el blanco.
-------------------------------------
 varias ideas tácticas como c4 , a6 , cg4, bg4 me parecen de atención. me preocupa que el blanco juegue f4 pronto
-------------------------------------
 14.f4 es la jugada "temida" por mi. no sé realmente q pueda ser la mejor jugada, pero he tomado en cuenta 2 opciones 14...,cg4 15.bg1 y quizá 15...,exf4
-------------------------------------
 o 16.h3, fxe4 o ...,cf6 17.exf5 bd5 18.th2,exf4 19.g.xf4 y quizá pueda explotar la columna e hacia el rey blanco creo que tomaría la primera opción.
-------------------------------------
 15.bf2 me parece que esta jugada acepta el destino de las blancas de una posición inferior, quizá desde un punto de vista de control de daños es mejor que bg1.
-------------------------------------
  15.bf2 invita c4 y es lo que juego 17...,rd8 amenazando tomar el alfil y ganar material había la opción de tomar en a7 para el blanco pero por alguna razón no me preocupa demasiado.sin embargo puedo estar equivocado. 18. nc3 agua la fiesta , y solo queda la temática pareja de alfiles para el negro, pero esta bien 19.f5 aunque si calcule algunas lineas no veo mayores problemas con abrir lineas hacia el rey blanco es una jugada más de concepto ( pareja de alfiles y mejor desarrollo se beneficia con centro y lineas abiertas) 20...,fxe4 creo que me apresuré a jugar , pero aun el negro esta mejor.   
-------------------------------------
advancing the king's pawn up two squares is highly useful because it occupies a center square, attacks the center square d5, and allows the development of white's king's bishop and queen as black my normal response to 1.e4 is 1...c5, but this time i chose 1...e5. . . . ? losing a tempo in development. because i normally play 1...c5 i would not guard the g5-square at this time and could face the unpleasant  ng5 with attack on unprotected f7. but here h6 is not necessary because blacks queen is controlling g5. a general rule is also that moving the rank pawns is not the best because it later can turn out to be an attacking point in order to weaken the castled king side. personally i often find it hard to not move h6/a6 or a3/h3 because i'm not too happy about the bishop on g4/b4/g5/b5.  i think this is the best move now! challenging control for center of the board. . 5 bf4 was probably the best, which give black temporarily a chance to keep the d4 pawn and white has to spend time and effort to win back the pawn. better would be nxd4.. i decided to defend the pawn. equally good or better is probably bb4+. ?! i don't follow the idea/continuation of na3. if looking at general/beginners opening rules this is a poor move. but maybe white has a longer plan for it? knights doesn't like to be ranked, which give them less influence in controlling squares again black make a poor move. the idea is to prevent white nb5 with help from bf4 will attack on c7. but far better and still protecting c7 is 6...d6, with healthy development for black by opening the d7-h3 diagonal again i don't follow what black has in mind. personally i think castling would be the natural continuation. 7...nge7 would have been better and continued the development for black. this is what i would call the first mistake for white. again i would like to hear what white had in mind. black immediately took advantage of this...and played nxd5 . . best continuation. e.g. qe7 pinning down the knight to king is easily answered by white castling. sensible move! i was not sure about this move, but didn't find any better move. nf6 was into consideration, but for unknown reason i didn't like white response qe2+. bxa3 was also interesting without me finding a likable continuation ?? first blunder! why not qe2? or possibly better was kd2. after making some lighter mistakes it is preferable to keep the queen in the game. i think this move kind of ruined the game for white. jeg synes ikke partier er så interessant etter tabben 11.le3??, men jeg vil raskt gå gjennom resten av partiet for å se på generelt spill/brikkeføring. for jeg synes å huske at du viser tegn på langt dypere spilleforståelse enn hva åpningen viste. . jeg tar med løperen fordi jeg ønsker å konstruere trusselen om avdekkersjakk(discovered check). aldri undervurder slike taktiske disposisjoner, hverken når du har muligheten til å gjøre det selv eller når du risikerer å bli utsatt for det. 
-------------------------------------
 her må du tenke gjennom hvordan du kan unngå/stoppe effekten.  tror qf3 hadde vært bedre her, gir kongen 2 felter å gå til i stedet for ett.  jeg har fortsatt avdekkersjakken tilgjengelig og ser ingen grunn til å oppheve den. her forutså jeg mulig 14. qe2 og da tenkte jeg at min fortsettelse vil bli litt ubehagelig. generelt: jeg bruker tiden til å utvikle egne brikker og posisjon, mens du prøver å komme deg ut av en litt låst stilling bra! . her ser jeg at din dronning støtter h3, lh5, g4 og løser litt av problemene dine kongen din er avdekket for angrep, men jeg kan avsløre nå at jeg hadde et bedre trekk, sjølv om også dette er nesten like bra.
-------------------------------------
  . ?? en skikkelig tabbe av meg. strengt tatt burde jeg ha funnet sjakkmatt her også
-------------------------------------
8. ne5? et håpløst trekk. dette trekket var lite gjennomtenkt. ikke bare flytter jeg samme brikke to ganger, men det eneste jeg ”tjener” på trekket er at jeg prøver meg på et utrolig lettsett angrep ved lage fork på tårn og dame. 
-------------------------------------
 her burde jeg nok heller ha castlet mot kongesiden for å unngå videre forviklinger som fører til at jeg gjør en ny feil etter 10… qe7+! 11. be3? her aner jeg virkelig ikke hva jeg gjorde. eneste jeg kan tenke meg er at jeg tenkte at det nok ville være smart å ofre løper for å kunne castle og beskytte kongen senere i spillet. regnet med at hvis jeg heller tok 11. de2 så kom 11… dxd2 12. kxe2 og dermed var muligheten til å castle ute.
-------------------------------------
  jeg burde nok heller gjort dette for etter 13. te1 videre fulgt av f eks 14. kf1 så ville jeg omtrent havnet som ved rokkade. 13. g3? jeg tenker at jeg skal castle dronningside og etter å ha lest om utvikling av bønder så fikk jeg det for meg at siden jeg ikke skulle castle mot kongeside så kunne jeg utvikle bonden. 
-------------------------------------
 et mye bedre valg her hadde vært 13.h3! ved å blokkere løper på c8 til å sette dronningen under press og senere føre til at kongen blir fanget mot kongeside hvor det verken er brikker eller bønder til å stå imot et angrep. 
-------------------------------------
 jeg tror også at 13. sf2 hadde vært et greit alternativ ved at jeg blokkerer g4 for løper samtidig som jeg mulig kan friste motstander til å gjøre et bytte av springer mot løper.  14. de2 er også et forferdelig hastetrekk gjort for å åpne opp til dronningside castling som faktisk ikke går pga løper på e3. ved 13. sf2 kunne det også åpnet opp til at 14. sc4 ville kommet så sant ikke trekket 13. df6 kommer. 19. nf2? nok et dårlig trekk som låses når 19.be3 kommer. 
-------------------------------------
 her ville nok kanskje 19. te1 vært et bedre alternativ, selv om jeg nå tror jeg er såpass fastklemt i hjørnet uten dekning fra verken bønder eller løpere som nok kunne vært viktig. dermed føler jeg at ofringen av løper tidligere i spillet var et utrolig dårlig valg. bør det sørges for at man har en løper så fremt dronningen fortsatt er på brettet? for her er det jo så å si løperene som sperrer av og videre setter pin på springer som fører til at dronningen kan gå på å gjøre som den vil. 20. h3 er nok et relativt godt trekk ved at det frigjører h2 plassen til tårnet som jeg bruker for å ta løper som ofrer seg for å ta springer på f2 og deretter fører til et bytte av dronninger. 27. te7? her kommer det altfor offensive spillet mitt godt frem. selv med -6 i materialt tap. dårlig utvikling av bønder. en usikker konge og en springer som er litt fastlåst til a3 gjør dette trekket enda dårligere. 28. txc7? kommer som følge av offensivt spill og rett og slett et forsøk fra å stjele en uslig bonde som ikke er med i spillet på noen som helst måte da denne er på dronningsside og dermed ikke vil hjelpe meg noe i forsvar på kongesiden. 30. sc2? selv om jeg har tapt kunne jeg heller ofret tårnet for å ta springer som ville utsatt matt ved, 
-------------------------------------
 30. txe2 … txe2+ 31. kg3 etterfulgt av utvikling av bønder hos deg som ville ført til matt.

esta fue mi primera victoria como jugador en gameknot, aunque llena de errores, es algo significativa para mi. veamos... todo empezo muy bien, salida del peon del rey. a la amenaza del peon de f7 conteste atacando el peon de e4 aqui ataco su peon de centro una jugada criticable pero solo defendia la posicion de mi caballo evito el avance del peon a d4 interesante jugada! procura el avance del peon a d4 y ademas activa su dama en el otro flanco controlo la diagonal para atacar el peon de f2 y asi evito el avance a d4 un ataque significativo!!! ataca el arfil negro y proteje el peon debil de f2 esta es la peor jugada que se pudo ocurrir¿¿ aqui se entrega limpio el arfil negro. pero despues de esa mala jugada siguio otra peor¿¿ viene el intercambio!! que sin importar el resultado salen ganando las negras fruto que pudieron haber tenido 3ptos menos jaque importante asi se salva el arfil jugada que debilita totalmente el flanco de la dama blanca aqui las blancas obstentan mejor posicion y calidad si termina aqui las negras pierden, veamos como sigue: las blancas entraron en un intercambio desfavorable porque activo la dama negra y su arfil. aqui la calidad y la posicion variaron en solo dos jugadas. muy bien!! proteje g2 y la torre ademas de menos movimiento para la dama. enroque discutible: ademas de proteger el rey busca clavar el arfil de e3 sale el caballo un poco tarde¿ veamos: controlar diagonales es el fin de los arfiles acercandose el final mala jugada¿¿ se debio enroscar con ese ataque facil de evadir por la dama que ahora busca evitar el enrosque. asi se controlan las posiciones. el arfil proteje el peon debil de c3 pero por ahora esta fuera de combate la jugada tae1 puede ser criticable, pudo ser tfe1 las negras logran su cometido evitar el enrosque. asi casi nos acercamos al final. mala jugada¿¿ se debio evitar el movimiento del caballo a h5 peligro en la cueva negra, las blancas tratan de recuperar terreno perdido, aunque un caballo solo no puede movimiento para evitar el jaque y tambien e total control de la columna e jugada de doble filo!¿ las blancas desesperadas por el control de la columna e proponen el intercambio. las negras ven la perdida de su posicion favorable y deciden no entrar al derramamiento de sangre; por lo que idealizan una jugada estrategica la cual llevan a cabo: evitar el jaque con el caballo de h5. veamos las blancas entraron en un camino dificil... sin posicion favorable y calidad dividida no se entra en ese tipo de contienda.¿¿ mala jugada¿¿¿ jaque con nada de efecto y a la vez activa al rey en el umbral de final de juego aqui solo le queda a las blancas mantener vivo el caballo, no deben entregarlo, asi le cueste tiempo las negras ven su debilidad y van tras él. ahora si!! las negras proponen un cambio de caballos, solo con el fin de despejar su dama y poder llegar al rey enemigo por lo que el peon d4 estorbaba y de paso se elimina el caballo blanco errante. veamos todo sigue segun lo planeado... se produjo el intercambio... todo despejado para las negras que ahora ganan dos peones. desesperacion.¿¿ se debio activar la dama blanca con este movimiento entramos a una final de damas. ultimos indicios de ataques blancos... la dama negra no deja su control de la columna e movimientos equivocados¿¿ solo los peones protejen al rey blanco control en la columna d, las negras deben evitar algun tipo de intercambio, solo los favorables. jugada sin sentido¿¿ continuan¿¿ jugada pesima¿¿ pero la ultima... mate en dos!! un mate ordinario para tan buen medio juego.

  slab potez bijelog: sada crni konj ima puno više prostora za manevar a i nepotrebno  bijeli vrši pritisak na centralnog piješaka- ispravno! trebalo je  prvo 22....rac8 i nakon 23.bd5 h6 lovac na d3 je bilo bolje..(crni konj se mora vratit na f6 da čuva pješaka, a bijeli dobiva slobodan prostor za napredak pješaka po a i b liniji) velika pogreška crnog,sada se lovac izvlači i lagano otvara prostor pješacima... ponovo greška crnog.sada bijeli povlači lovca i ima veliku priliku pješacima realizirati partiju crni pokušava jeftino zaradit :) bijeli se polakomio za piješaka i napravio ključnu grešku koja je prelomila partiju:crni u idućih par poteza lijepom kombinacijom vraća piješaka i to sa b linije koja je predstavljala izuzetnu opasnost! uzimanje pješaka sa b linije-odličan potez! na 31.axb4 rxc8 32.bxc8 rxd4 crni opet vraća piješaka i bolje stoji! crni mora jest sa kulom: na 31...nxd5 32.rxd8 kxg8 33.bxa7 i bijeli ostaje s figurom više bijeli ispravno ne želi razmjeniti lovce jer su raznobojni ,medjutim teško je sada u ovoj poziciji parirati crnom velika greška bijeloga s kojom potpisuje poraz,trebalo je 34.rb3 bc3 35.b5   
-------------------------------------
essa é minha partida preferida! estou jogando de pretas, por isso, se no seu computador o tabuleiro estiver com as peças brancas na parte de baixo, sugiro que inverta o tabuleiro, para visualizar melhor (sob o ponto de vista das pretas). h3: um lance passivo demais das brancas. nessa hora, já comecei a pensar: vou tomar a iniciativa... e6: o objetivo é jogar, em seguida, c5, pra trocar meu peão de ala por um peão de centro das brancas (faço isso sempre que posso, pois dominar o centro do tabuleiro com peões é essencial) e3: tudo bem que esse lance abre caminho para o bispo branco de f1, mas acaba satisfazendo a vontade das pretas (isso é, trocar um peão de ala - no caso, c5 - por um peão central das brancas - no caso, e3) aqui, eu deveria ter primeiro trocado o peão (cxd4), antes de liberar meu cavalo, pois agora as brancas podem jogar, por exemplo, c3, defendendo o peão de d4 com mais um peão, o que estragaria o plano das pretas de trocar um peão de flanco por um branco de centro... ...mas, em vez de c3, as brancas preferiram esse lance bobo (bb5). esse lance (bb5) é uma perda de tempo, porque obrigará as brancas a fazer jogadas defensivas, movendo a mesma peça mais de uma vez, enquanto as pretas partirão para o ataque, desenvolvendo suas peças. taí porque o lance anterior das brancas foi "bobo": a rainha preta dá cheque ao rei e, ao mesmo tempo, ataca o bispo em b5. esse é o único lance das brancas que, ao mesmo tempo, defende o rei e o bispo de b5. a ideia, obviamente, é atacar o defensor do bispo, no caso, o cavalo em c3. as brancas não podem mover o cavalo (porque não podem expor o rei ao cheque da rainha). e não adiantaria, por exemplo, jogar qd3 pra defender o cavalo, porque senão as pretas jogariam c4, atacando a dama branca. por isso, as brancas não tiveram opção, a não ser trocar o bispo ameaçado pelo cavalo em c6, como farão a seguir... péssimo lance das brancas. elas estavam tentando evitar a troca de cavalos e a perda do peão b2, que seria tomado pela rainha preta após 9 ... nxc3 - 10 bxc3 qxc3. melhor para as brancas teria sido rocar e "aceitar" a perda do peão, um prejuízo que sairia "mais barato" do que o que acabou acontecendo depois... como eu disse, o lance anterior das brancas foi péssimo... por causa dessa resposta! o bispo preto se transforma num verdadeiro monstro, dominando a diagonal a6-f1, sufocando as peças brancas e impedindo o roque das brancas por um bom tempo... a única casa segura da rainha branca é a casa de origem... o jogo das brancas começa a se restringir, ficando absolutamente encolhido. o bispo preto de a6, agora, impede o roque branco, pois ataca a casa f1. e as brancas não têm mais o bispo de casas brancas para combater o bispo das pretas. é esse tipo de posição que faz com que um bispo valha mais até do que uma torre (esse conceito é muito importante no xadrez: o valor de cada peça varia de acordo com sua mobilidade e sua influência no tabuleiro) o lance óbvio, ameaçando ganhar um peão após uma eventual troca de cavalos... em vez de bxnc3, talvez o melhor teria sido qd2... talvez... agora, além de ganhar o peão, a rainha dá cheque ameaçando a torre de a1. obviamente, se as brancas tivessem jogado qd2, perderiam a torre de a1. pra ganhar mais um peão...  e além de ganhar mais um peão, ameaçar o bispo em f4... ao final do jogo, ficará evidente que esse lance de bispo vai custar caro para as brancas (tirando o bispo do domínio da diagonal h2-b8)... por causa desse lance das brancas, eu percebi uma possibilidade de mate bastante interessante (verão mais adiante). melhor teria sido, para as brancas, defender o bispo com g3, por exemplo, apesar de g3 ser uma defesa mais passiva do que atacar a rainha com fizeram as brancas... esse é um exemplo de que nem sempre ameaçar as peças adversárias é a melhor opção. nesse lance, dei início ao meu plano. faltava colocar apenas mais uma peça em jogo... com rb1, o plano das brancas é, claramente, jogar a torre em b3, afugentando a dama preta, pra desafogar um pouco a situação. eu precisava evitar isso, pois para meu plano dar certo, eu precisava que minha rainha ficasse onde está... ... então, usei o bispo pra matar o plano das brancas, cobrindo a casa b3 e, de quebra, ameaçando o peão de a2. o cavalo não pode tomar o bispo por estar cravado - e o rei não pode se mover para libertar o cavalo, porque o bispo domina as casas e2 e f1! pelo jeito, as brancas pensaram que a maior ameaça das pretas era tomar o peão de a2; por isso, moveram-no para defendê-lo, em vez de voltar a torre para a1. provavelmente, as brancas ficaram com raiva de ter que voltar a rainha no início, e por isso recusaram-se a voltar a torre... eis, aqui, o lance que parece inofensivo, mas que na verdade esconde uma ameaça fatal para as brancas. a propósito, aqui é que fica evidente o erro de posicionamento do bispo branco - que não deveria ter abandonado essa diagonal h2-b8, como já disse.  nessa posição, poucos lances poderiam evitar uma derrota imediata das brancas, como por exemplo:  17. qf3 (que resultaria na queda do peão c2, formando um final de peões que levaria a uma vitória fácil para as pretas) ou 17. rb3 (sacrificando a torre branca em troca do meu incômodo bispo preto, o que de qualquer forma me daria também uma vantagem decisiva no fim de jogo).  o melhor lance para as brancas, ao meu ver, seria 17.qg4, mas as brancas provavelmente não viram nada bom nisso, e preferiram evitar a perda do peão a2 jogando a4. ...mas as brancas não viram a ameaça, e não jogaram nem qg4, nem qf3 e nem rb3. impedidas de fazer o roque, a intenção das brancas com o lance 17. h4 era, claramente, de colocar a torre em h3 para tentar afugentar a rainha preta...  só que agora, já era tarde demais: as pretas dão mate em dois lances. você consegue enxergar a sequência de mate?... pow!!!!! um sacrifício soberbo de dama para alguém tão capivara como eu! obviamente, não serviria 18 qe2, porque 18 ... qxqe2 seria mate... ... só que as pretas não perceberam que meu par de bispos era ainda mais poderoso do que minha rainha!  esse exemplo, apesar de longe de ser uma partida bem jogada (pois desde a abertura ambos os jogadores cometeram vários deslizes), ilustra alguns conceitos importantes do xadrez, como por exemplo a importância de se ter um conhecimento mínimo da abertura (o que, nesse caso, nenhum dos dois jogadores tinha), e também o conceito do desenvolvimento - ou seja, a necessidade de se desenvolver rapidamente as peças menores (cavalos e bispos) e rocar o mais cedo possível (regras desrespeitadas pelas brancas quando elas jogaram h3, por exemplo). aqui, você pode me perguntar: se o roque é tão importante, porque as pretas não rocaram? simples: porque não precisaram, pois as brancas, ao decidir não rocar, se colocaram em uma posição vulnerável, sendo obrigadas a se defender - e as pretas não desperdiçaram tempo e atacaram com todas as suas forças. e, obviamente, enquanto as pretas estavam atacando, seu rei não corria perigo. o jogo mostra, também, quão poderosa é a rainha (como as pretas mostraram no início) e o quão vulnerável é a rainha (quando precisa fugir das peças menores, como foi o lamentável caso da rainha branca). 
-------------------------------------
that move solved any black problems (development) now white is fixed a nice try to trap me so far so well, that avoids qe8 # and wins better was kf1, nevertheless it´s lost for white ??? my blunder of the year !!! highest award !!! this happens if i am euphoric (like a fool) thinking about a nice way how to kill. ignoring the possibility of any counter attack ;-) why not rxh4+ (instead of bxh1)? see: 28. gxh4 - qg2#  or 28. kh3 - qxh3# !!! looks easy.  here the reward !! 28. qxc4+ - kh8 29.nf7+ - kg8 30.nh6+ - kh8 31.qg8+ - txg8 32.nf7#

지형 안녕~ 어줍잖게 comment를 좀 달아보려고 해. 도움이 될거라고 믿어 :)  체스에서 처음 목표에는 크게 3가지가 있어~  1. piece development - 피스들을 빨리 꺼내는 거야. 나잇은 꺼내기가 쉽지만, 비숍이랑 룩은 처음 상태로는 움직일 수 없지~ 그래서 폰을 움직일 필요가 있어.  2. 공간 장악하기? 중앙을 컨트롤하는 게 중요해~ 여기서 완전 중앙은 d4 d5 e4 e5 이렇게 네 개이지만, 그 주변을 둘러싼 칸들도 중요하고. 그래서 처음에 d/e폰을 움직이는 게 일반적이고, 이걸 또 피스들로 뒷받침해주는 거지~  3. king safety - 킹은 가운데에 그대로 있으면 공격 타겟이 되니까, 캐슬링으로 옮기는거.. 물론 캐슬링을 안 하는게 더 안전한 경우도 있지만, 많지는 않아.  그래서 1.h4는 가장자리에 있는 폰을 옮기는 건데, 1/3에는 도움이 안 되고 2에는 도움이 되는 듯.. 하지만 보통 킹 쪽에 있는 룩은 어차피 캐슬링한 다음에 자유로워지니까 굳이 h폰을 올릴 필요는 없지~ 그러니까 난 바로 d폰을 올림~ 응 그니깐 지형도 이렇게 중앙 폰을 올리고~ 이건 자주 보이는 패턴인데, c폰을 올려서 지형 d폰을 공격하는 거야~ 지형 입장에서 이건 먹어도 되고 안 먹어도 되지만, 굳이 지금 먹을 필요는 없어. 왜냐하면 dxc5를 하면 (x는 잡아먹는거야~ d에 있는 폰이 c5를 잡아먹으니까 dxc5야) 나는 결국 나중에 이 폰을 되찾을 수 있거든~ 그니까 이럴 때는 nf3를 하면 나잇으로 d폰을 보호하면서 피스도 꺼내는 셈이 되니까, 보통은 그런게 좋아~  물론 먹는 것도 나쁜 방법은 아니고~ 나는 나중에 e6으로 폰을 움직이고 f8에 있는 비숍으로 저걸 먹으려고 하는 게 기본적인 plan이야. 그 때 지형은 굳이 저걸 지키려고 할 필요가 없고 (어차피 하나를 먼저 먹었으니까). 나잇을 꺼냅니다~ f1 비숍을 꺼내려는 거겠지? 또다른 나잇을 꺼냅니다~ ! 좋은 수야~ 나는 저 나잇을 지금 이대로 움직일 수가 없게 되잖아? (움직이면 킹이 체크에 걸리니까) 이런 식으로 못 움직이게 하는걸 pin이라고 하는데. 비숍은 나잇에 pin을 걸어두기에 좋음~ 그럼 나는 저 나잇을 움직이려면 일단 c8에 있는 비숍을 d7로 옮겨야겠지~ 그러니까 빨리 저 비숍을 쫓아버리고 싶은거지 ㅋㅋ 나쁘지 않아~ 그치만 e2로 가도 괜찮았을 거야. 이제 c5 폰을 되찾으려고 하는거지~ ! 이것도 좋은 수야. 굳이 지키려고 할 필요가 없이, 피스를 꺼내는 거지. 폰을 되찾으면서 비숍을 develop 시키고~ 음~ 이건 약간 낭비같아! 왜냐면 지금 저 비숍을 3번 움직였잖아~ 같은 피스를 너무 많이 움직이는 건 별로 안 좋아. 차라리 nf3으로 나잇을 꺼내는게 어땠을까~  
-------------------------------------
je pensais que ce coup sortait de la théorie mais apparemment non, on est encore dans une variante de l'écossaise. je pense que ce coup n'est pas génial.dans la phase de développement, mieux aurait valu sortir le fou c1...le fait qu'il reste toute la partie en c1 m'a gêné. pas bon, car tu perds un temps précieux dans cette phase en rejouant la même pièce. il aurait été préférable de jouer fou en e7 pour roquer ensuite, ou dame pour faire ensuite le grand roque. j'élude la menace potentielle du cavalier e5 en 2 temps....  1 la prise du fou.... ....2 f4 pour protéger la case e5 je pense que quelque chose comme cavalier b6 pour ensuite pousser pion d5 aurait été un meilleur plan....mais bon, pas simple du fait du retard de dvlmt l'enchaînement me donne un pion, à cause de la faiblesse sur case blanche (plus de fou sur cases blanches), ainsi que du retard de développement. le retard de devlpt est maintenant clair : ma dame bloque la suite....(sortie du fou) a mon avis, un temps de perdu. répondre à une menace par une menace est à peser méticuleusement..... "chiche" :)))))) et paf, la menace de mat me permet de dégager la dame -> soit tu perds une dame, soit tu es mat..    
-------------------------------------
this game is annotated with my thoughts as i was deciding on each and every move. annotations are unedited notes i took along the way. all comments are most welcome. i was deciding between 5...nf6 and 5...nc6, and in the end chose 5...nf6 to block the move e4 a get one move closer to castling. i also noticed that it lets me answer 6.dxc5 with 6...bxc5. i made a mistake moving 5...nf6. i should have played 5...nc6 to be able to move ...d4 if needed. now the d pawn was threatened (7.bxf6 qxf6 8.nxd5), so i had to defend it. at least there is no ng5 threat, because the g5 square is occupied. the threat is 8.e5 and i have to prevent it. counterattacking via 7...cxd4 is weak after 8.qxd4 nc6 9.bb5 and e5 is still a threat and white’s pieces are much more active. if 7...dxe4 then 8.nxe4 be7 (my pawn structure on the kingside is threatened) 9.bxf6 bxf6 10.nxc5 and the threats are: capturing on e6, capturing on b7, i am a pawn down, and the c5 knight is very strong. after 7...be7 if 8.e5 then 8...nfd7 is good for me (i increase protection of the c pawn, the position will not open up suddenly, etc.). so probably 9.exd5 nxd5. then 9.nxd5 bxg5 (9...bxd5 10.qe2 is uncomfortable, because i cannot castle) or 9.bxe7 qxe7 or 9.dxc5 bxg5. i am definitely worse and after a check on b5 i will end up with a weak c pawn, but this is the price i pay for the mistake on the 5th move. i cannot leave the d pawn without queen’s protection, so this is the only move. i am afraid of 9.qa4 and i will likely need to give up a pawn after subsequent bxc6 and qxc6, but i hope that after ...rc8 i will have compensation. i will then try to open up the position as quickly as possible (my plan after 9.qa4 is 9...0-0). the only possibility is moving the knight away, but where to? 9...nh5 loses after 10.g4. 9...ng4 is tempting, but after 10.bf4 and 11.h3 the knight needs to escape to h6, and this is bad for me. 9...ne4 weakens my center too much (10.nxe4 dxe4 11.bxe7 qxe7 12.nd2 and i cannot save the pawn, while the knight at e4 will have a nice outpost). so only 9...nd7 remains, but this move is actually quite nice: defends c5, attacks e5, and breaks the pin on the c6 knight. after 10...nxd7 i did not like 11.dxc5 0-0 (to be able to recapture on c5) 12.b4! and white has a pawn majority on the queenside and quite a lot of space there, too (not to mention the pawn, because it’s not going to be easy to get to the e5 pawn). now i can also lose a pawn (11.qa4 0-0 12.bxc6 bxc6 13.qxc6), but at least i have some compensation (open b and c files). i have to capture (otherwise i will face for example 12.bxc6 bxc6 13.b4), but capturing with the knight does not work: 11...nxc5 12.nxd5 bxd5 13.qxd5 and i am much worse. if bxc6 then my plan is bxc6 (defends the d pawn and makes ...c5 a possibility). i’d like to finally castle. i have also analyzed 12.rc1, but it does not threaten anything (the b5 bishop is attacked), so i can then also safely castle. if 12.ng5 then either 12...0-0 or even 12...ndxe5. i am also thinking about ...d4 to open up the diagonal for the e6 bishop and attack the defender of the b5 bishop (but it does not work after, for example, 12.rc1). a natural move, but i also considered 12...d4 (looking for a tactic based on attacked e5 pawn and the fact that the b5 bishop is only defended by the c3 knight), but after 13.bxc6 (forced) dxc3 (the only way to make something out of the idea) 14.bxd7+ bxd7 15.bxc3 i am worse: i lost a pawn, and if i try to get it back after 15...qxc3 then after 16.rc1 i am afraid of heavy pieces’ activity down the c and d files. i have also considered 12...rc1 (so that after 13.bxc6 i can recapture by ...rxc6), but i’d like to finally break the pin of my knights against my king, and also after 13.bxc6 rxc6 14.na4 the queen is somehow uncomfortably placed. 13...qxc6 was an alternative, but it leads to an unpleasant defensive task after 14.nd4 qc8 15.f4 nb6 16.f5 with an attack on my king. i don’t think i stand any chance in this position. now everything revolves around the ...c5 move. if i get to play it, i will have counterchances. if not, i will need to passively defend with little chance of succeeding. what is likely coming is 14.nd4, when i want to play 14...qb6 preventing 15.f4 (15...c5 16.f5? cxd4). found after a long think. i have planned 14...qe7 (i liked 14...rb8 better, but after 15.nd4 it’s difficult to move queen so as not to lose the c6 pawn) and then 15...rb8 or 15...c5. but i did not know what to do after 15.nd4 c5 16.nxe6. should i capture with the queen or the pawn? in any case, i make it possible for the black f pawn to move forward, and this is good for white. this last observation made me notice the move i actually played. i am threatening the e pawn. my queen is safe (15.ne4 qe7; 15.na4 qb5 16.nd4 bxd1 17.nxb5 cxb5 and i win). so white will need to play re1 sooner or later and then i can play ...rfe8. this gives me more activity than i have right now and does not prevent the ...c5 plan. according to the plan i keep on attacking the e pawn that became a weakness. i was mostly worried about 16.ne4 to which i was thinking about 16...qe7? 17.nd6 and it looks bad, but then i realized that 16...qe7 drops the c pawn, so i need to play 16...qb6, but this is good for me, because after 17.nd6 i can play 17...rxe5 when the knight loses its support. i don’t see how white can defend the e pawn now, so likely the best option at his disposal is 16.e6 when i plan to play 16...rxe6 and perhaps after 17.rxe6 something like 17...fxe6!? looks like the only move. i have also considered 16...dxe4 17.rxc5 (17.qxd7 bxd7) nxc5 18.qc2 and i don’t get sufficient compensation. other queen moves were bad (e.g., 16...qb5 17.nd6; 16...qb4 17.qd2!). the d6 knight is threatened (has no safe square to move to). (1) 18.rxe5 nxe5 19.h3 bxf3 20.gxf3 g6 planning ...rd8 (2) 18.nxe5 bxd1 19.nxd7 qc7 should win. for a while i thought about sacrificing the exchange 17...nxe5 18.nxe8 rxe8, but after analyzing a few possible variations i concluded my back rank is too weak to get into such a position. i have also considered 17...re6 (threatening to capture on e5 and then take the knight), but after 18.h3 bxf3 19.qxf3 nxe5 and then for example 20.qh5 i did not see a good continuation. writing these notes down i also noticed that 19...nxe5 is not even obvious, because 20.rxe5 has to be considered. i spent a long time thinking on this move. i considered 18...re6, but this loses after 19.ng5 that threatens mate and attacks the rook. 18...qxb2 looks interesting, but after 19.nd4 my pieces lose coordination and white’s pieces attack my weaknesses (even 19.rxc6 is possible). 18...nc5 was tempting, but after 19.qc3 i don’t have a good square for the knight (plus during calculations i hallucinated and thought after 19.qe3 i don’t have the time to capture on f3 because of a back-rank mate, not seeing that the rook is still on e5). this left me with either the game move or 18...bxf3 first. i did not see a big difference and the rook on e5 does not stand well, so i exchanged rooks first. i also hoped for some ...nc5 afterwards, but now, when writing this, i see this was a hallucination, again (now qe3 is really dangerous). i don’t want to let the knight move to d4 or g5; my bishop is definitely the worse piece. after the exchange i am a pawn up with a bit of white’s activity on the kingside, but i think i can compensate for that. my plan (after 20.qxf3) is to play 20...nf6. i’m not afraid of 21.re7, because i can play 21...qd8 and win. i can then plan ...ne4 (attacking f2), capturing on b2, pushing the d and c pawns, ...rd8, and ...g6 (e.g., 21.nf5 g6 and if 22.qg3 then 22...ne4). i think my position is better, because white’s only plan is kingside attack, and i should be able to defend. instead, i have a lot of possibilities.  already after making my move i noticed the interesting possibility 19...qb4! and after a quick analysis i got convinced this was winning: there is no way to simultaneously defend the e1 rook and the d6 knight, and there is no counterattack in sight. after this discovery i no longer have the heart for this game...  the threat was qxf7+ with a quick mate and moves 20...rf8 and even more so 20...f6 do not look appetizing. i can now think about ...ne4 (attacking f2), ...qxb2, ...rd8, maybe ...g6. the same move that i noticed too late on the 19th move wins. 21.nf5 was necessary (and this is what i expected). my back rank is sufficiently protected (in case of 22.qe2) and white has no way of saving both the rook and the knight. 
-------------------------------------
je joue principalement d4 au premier coup et je suis 3 objectifs fondamentaux dès le début de la partie: 1 le centre; 2 le centre; 3, le centre. mon adversaire joue son fou avec les cavaliers, ce qui est contraire au lois générales d'ouverture. en fait, les cases des cavaliers sont connues d'avance. de plus, ils auront à bouger plus que les fous. alors autant commencer rapidement. avec ce coup les noirs violent à nouveau une autre règle: ne pas jouer deux fois la même pièce dans l'ouverture. 
-------------------------------------
 c'est une perte de temps. l'échange est défavorable aux noirs. ils consomment encore un temps pour la prise…  les noirs jouent à nouveau leur fou, oubliant de se développer. sur 7 coups, ils ont joué 3 fois le cavalier (qui a disparu) et deux fois le fou. 
-------------------------------------
 les blancs n'ont jamais joué deux fois la même pièce, se sont développés et ont déjà roquer… le retard de dévelopement des noirs est flagrant (avec un pion doublé) bon, là, je me suis dit: j'ai une meilleure position, je suis mieux développé, la faiblesse du pion b7 est flagrante. allez, j'y vais !! mieux valait cç6 ç4 me donne un peu d'air. néanmoins, il faut que je fasse attention à ne pas me faire enfermer la dame… da6 n'est pas super. en fait, j'ai croqué un pion, mais je redoute la faiblesse de ma dame sous l'attaque des noirs. je pense à l'enfermement. avec b4, je cherche à ouvrir les lignes… dç7 perd une pièce, ouf !! a la mémoire de fischer peut-être… les noirs gaffent. f4 est désastreux. les noirs ont désormais deux pièces en prises. dommage que les blancs ne jouent qu'un coup. et un pion central, un ! après g3, je suis assez content de ma position. je vais croquer au moins une pièce, et donc, tout va bien pour moi. en fait, après g3, les blancs sont totalement perdants !! en effet, le pion en f3 empêche toute fuite du roi. si la dame s'immisce sur l'aile roi, les blancs sont contraints de donner leur dame pour éviter le mat. 19...df7, et le sort est réglé pour les blancs !! les noirs n'ont plus qu'à transférer leur dame sur la colonne h et donner le mat. inutile de vous préciser que ma propre dame est carrément hors-jeu !! reprendre du cavalier est encore une erreur, pour les mêmes raisons que le coup précédent... la pression sur g7 est à son comble…  
-------------------------------------
in this game, we enter a doubled-edged, but known position, where white has sacrificed a pawn but in return has ample compensation. my opponent is the first to deviate from the opening databases i am using. i try to prove his deviation wrong, by a bold attack on his rook by my bishop. he ignores this attack and offer the rook which i take. he offers a second pawn which i also take, and then a third which i also takes. he then finds a stunning bishop sacrifice, which leads to mate in 5 if i take. i decline the bishop, and he quickly regains all his sacrificed material and my position is a wreck. i struggle on, but it is hopeless! if you want annotation on these early moves see this game. http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/shropshire-2-v-wood-green-mm3?gm=62262 so it starts out as a grünfeld defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence. which white has countered with the exchange variation - the most popular way of meeting it, but certainly not the only way. reuben fine in his excellent book "the idea behind chess openings" (1943) stated that black had to play 6....c7-c5 before white could stop it with ba3. however soon afterwards it was found that ba3 could be met with nd7! followed by c7-c5! and white's pawn formation is shattered if the pawn is accepted. playing bg7 and 0-0 before c7-c5 does also have the advantage of avoiding lines where white checks on b5 with the bf1 - not that those lines are particularly good for white - but it saves me from having to learn the theory!  for decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with bc4 and ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or king-side attack. it was generally thought that an early nf3 was weak in the exchange variation because it allowed black too much pressure on the centre with ...bg4. in the late 1970s, however, karpov, kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange variation with white, often involving an early rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of black's queen-side. so this move rather signals that he will adopt one of these more modern approaches. from my point of view, we are now moving into the second phase of the game. up to now i had been playing what i always play in this position, but now my moves are guided by the opening databases. incidentally this variation is officially known as "the modern exchange variation". this is the most popular. clearly the strongest recapture, otherwise the pawn on c3 is weak - isolated and open to attack on open c file. similar to this game. http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/shropshire-2-v-wood-green-mm3?gm=62262 white boldly sacrifices the a pawn rather than submit to an exchange of queens - and the loss of attacking possibilities which goes with it - by qd2.  this is a known pawn sacrifice. white has attacking chances in return for the pawn. the position is unbalanced with opportunities for both sides. if black can weather the storm, the extra pawn may be vital in an ending. white completes the development. i decide to offer the return of the pawn, in order to activate my pieces - a decision based on the fact that this seems to be the most widely played move in this position. he attacks my e pawn. queen hurries back to defend. h6 is actually the most popular move in this position, but qe6 is second most popular and seemed to score better. he centralised his rook as in san segundo carrillo, pablo (2483) vs. alonso, salvador (2339). from my point of view, this is where i had to start to think for myself - i didn't want to follow the game above, with h6, as white won! of course i can't take on e4 as he has ba6! discovering an attack on my queen and after my queen moves he has bxb7 and bxra8. i wanted to develop my knight to c6, but of course to play it immediately allows the fork d4-d5, so how about qe6-d7 keeping the protection of e7, protecting b7 and preparing to develop the knight to c6. so i played it! and he stops it again.  this seemed to me to be a very logical move - i thought either he was forced to move his rook back to f1 or to block my attack with knight or bishop to d2, allowing exchanges which are favourable to me, the side with the extra pawn. foolishly i didn't even consider other moves where white sacrifices the exchange. gameknot gives 15. bc3 as a mistake and recommends na6 and i think its right. archduke_piccolo: h'mmm. bold and unexpected. there are so many ways to respond to this aggression. which to choose...? big think time me-erm-thinks... so this is the stunning offer of an exchange. now if i don't take he will play his rook on e1 to d1 or c1 with advantage. so i took. this is another excellent move by my opponent, which again i hadn't really looked at. i had rather expected him to take back on e1 with his rook, and then white hasn't got compensation for the sacrifices material. gameknot gives this as another mistake and recommends qd8, and is probably correct, but i wanted to keep b7 protected. archduke_piccolo: fascinating position. i have very active pieces, plenty of space , all sorts of possibilities... charleshiggie: yes, you have! but you have given me the christmas presents of an exchange and pawn... (i think it was about 26-12-2016 now) so he recaptures this bishop rather than the be1. and my other bishop runs away. ideally i would have loved to return to c3 and then g7, but 18....bc3 runs into 19. rc1 (win with the pin!) rc8 20. bd2 and i'm losing material. archduke_piccolo: here, have another pawn.   charleshiggie: many thanks! it would be rather rude not to accept christmas presents.. at this point i was rather concerned about him playing bh6 threatening my rook and a mate on g7.  so i played this - my third mistake. i should have returned a pawn with e5! gameknot gives the line  e5 21. bf6 re8 22. bxe5 rxe5 23. nxe5 qb6 24. nc4 qxb2 25. rxb2 nc6 26. rxb7 nd4 27. bd3 with a slight advantage to white of 0.61  generally i was far too over-confident in this position. i didn't realise that bc3 had been a mistake and that white actually had an advantage here - i thought that white didn't have enough for the sacrificed material. knowing when a side has sufficient compensation or not is a key skill that separates somene like me - a good club player - from a master. another excellent move by my opponent! charleshiggie: and another, you really are too kind... this in fact is my fourth and final mistake and white soon proves to have a winning position.  gameknot gives qe6 22. exf6 exf6 23. bxf6 rf7 24. nh6+ kf8 25. nxf7 kxf7 26. qxb7+ kxf6 27. qxa8 qxe2 28. qxb8 bb6 29. qh8+ kf5 30. qxh7 qxf2+ as the best continuation for black - but still white has an advantage of 2.56 he hits my queen. my queen runs. my first thought when i saw this was it was a mistake, and i could just take it. then i realised that if i took it, it is mate in 6. http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=183350 it now dawned on me, that far from having inadequate compensation for the sacrificed material, white was winning easily. i have to start giving back material, starting with the e pawn so that my queen can protect along the 7th rank. charleshiggie: bc4+! is a wonderful move! congratulations on finding it!  so the e pawn goes. he takes with check. king comes up. if it went to h8 instead, then 25. nxe5 threatens nf7 or nxg6 mate. throws in another check. king retreats to the corner. white now has a material advantage and a much better position - all his pieces are in play and my ra8 and nb8 are still unmoved. however, gameknot says even better was 26. nxe5 bc3 27. nf7+ kg8 28. qa3 bg7 29. bxg7 nc6 30. bxf8 rxf8 31. ng5+ kg7 32. rd7+ qxd7 33. bxd7 rf6 34. ne4 rf4 35. qb2+ kh6 36. qxb7 my knight finally comes out. looks good - attacking my queen - but gameknot says even better was 27. bd6 qg7 28. bxe5 nxe5 29. nxe5 rf8 30. rd3 rf6 31. rd7 rxe6 32. rxg7 kxg7 33. qxb7+ bc7 34. qxc7+ kf6 35. ng4+ kg5 36. ne3 h6 37. qxa7 the position is completely won for white. i played on, but no further comment is needed. according to gameknot neither side made any more mistakes. with my rook on b7 falling, it is time to give up. many thanks for reading. please rate this annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
this is an interesting companion to my other recent annotation http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/oswestry-v-telepost-shropshire-league?gm=62607 in that game, i had rook, knight and two pawns for the queen, and, on an open board, the queen was slightly better. in this game, i also have to give up my queen - but my two rooks are far better than the queen on the closed board. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_defence the most common move. my usual, although 2....d6 is more popular, normally leading to the najdorf_variation or the dragon_variation rossolimo variation - a well-respected alternative to 3.d4. it is named after nicolas rossolimo and is related to the moscow variation. white's usual intention is to play bxc6, giving black doubled pawns. black's major responses are 3...g6 preparing ...bg7, 3...d6 preparing ...bd7 (a hybrid line that also arises from the moscow variation after 2...d6 3.bb5+ nc6), and 3...e6 preparing 4...nge7. sergei rublevsky and tomáš oral both play this line as well as the moscow variation. this is my usual reply, although g6 is more common. the usual move. in this way i prevent him from doubling my c pawns. thematic - preparing to play d2-d4 with a good strong pawn centre. so i attack his bishop. he takes. i take back. he gets his centre. but i don't give him too much of a free hand there. the position is a little like an advanced french here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_defence#advance_variation:_3.e5 but compared to the advanced variation of the french defence, white's bishop has been exchanged for a black knight, so black is slightly less cramped. having said that, in a blocked position like this, the knight is better than the bishop. chances are about equal so i develop. so does he. i protect my c pawn as in semenova, lidia k (2271) vs. kernazhitsky, leonid (2355) which ended in a draw. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x1306386&fb=1&mv=18&rnd=0.27965961272303885 he deviates from that game, and i am thinking for myself! the logical move. the move was played on move 10 in semenova, lidia k (2271) vs. kernazhitsky, leonid (2355) followed by f2-f4, but my opponent has another plan. played to get my bc8 into play. i'm not sure why my opponent did this knight manoeuvre. it doesn't seem to have achieved anything. gameknot gives this as a mistake, and suggests  … cxd4 13. bxd4 nxd4 14. nxd4 qc7 15. nd3 a4 16. qd2 ba6 17. rfe1 a3 18. b3 rac8 19. rac1 qd7 20. rcd1 b5 as best for both sides, but i am not convinced. maybe 12....ba6 was best, as planned. he re-enforced e5. bishop finally reaches a6 the logical square for the rook. getting rid of my "bad" bishop, and removing a protector of e5. he takes back. threatening his pawn on e5. he protects it, threatening e5xf6 with a discovered attack on my queen in some variations. so i stop that. with my white-squared bishop gone, i am not afraid of putting pawns on white squares. logical to put his rook on the same file as my queen. so i block up the c file. his queen drops back. stopping his knight from coming to g5. he is clearly going to attack on the king-side. and my on the queen-side! he tries to slow my attack. but i advance any way. he throws in the bishop sacrifice. i decide that rather than accept, i will grab a pawn on the other side of the board.  he takes back. i grab the pawn. gameknot computer says this is a mistake and instead suggests 23. ra1 gxh6 24. rxa3 qg7 25. qc2 rfb8 26. raa1 ra6 27. reb1 rxb1+ 28. rxb1 a4 29. qb2 a3 30. qa2 ra8 31. kf1 which does seem pretty level. i finally take the bishop. he takes back. played to protect the e pawn. gameknot says it is a mistake and recommends  nd8 25. rb5 rf7 26. ng5 bf8 27. qh5 rg7 28. ra1 a4 29. qh6 qc6 30. rbb1 be7 31. ra2 ra7 32. re2 the computer is probably right, but i didn't want to break the connection between my rooks. attacking e6 again. of course, piece for pawn up, i offer a queen exchange. which my opponent wisely declines. overprotecting e6 but gameknot computer suggests bb4 27. rec1 re7 28. ra1 rb8 29. ra2 ree8 30. cxb4 axb4 31. rd1 b3 32. rb2 re7 33. qf3 qh6 34. qf4 ra7 35. kh2 instead. it is certainly an interesting concept - to return the piece to get two powerful passed pawns on the queen-side.  gameknot prefers 27. rb6 qh8 28. qg6+ qg7 29. qh5 and maybe a draw by repetition. i also wonder about the immediate 27. re3 preparing rg3 i seek to remove his attacking knight for my defensive knight, but gameknot says it is yet another mistake and suggests  … be7 28. rb5 bxg5 29. fxg5 nc6 30. rc5 rc8 31. rb1 rc7 32. rb6 nxe5 33. rxc7 qxc7 34. rxe6 qf7 35. qxf7+ nxf7 36. re7 a good attacking move. so i remove the aggressive knight. ok, find black's best move here?  did you find it? instead of the automatic recapture many would make, white find a wonderful to keep his attack alive. i have to play really carefully over the next few moves. so my bishop comes back to prevent rxg5 but white pins the bishop, and threatens rxe7 followed by rxg5. so i break the pin. i did also consider nf7 here, with the idea that after he takes my queen with check, i have rook, knight and bishop for the queen, but his rook is very active, for instance my a pawn is going. i think that would be very hard to win. he take a defender. i throw in a check forced, as he has to protect his rook. so i get first one rook for my queen. this is given as a mistake by gameknot which gives 33. rxg7+ rxg7 34. gxh3 a4 35. qd1 ra7 36. qh5 rae7. it seems strange to allow doubled h pawns, but in the game the white king is drawn to g3, meaning the white queen cannot check on g6 or g5 as black can defend with rg7, pinning the white queen against the black king. taking a second rook, and also drawing the white king onto the g file forced. this pawn is a winner. the white queen hurries back to stop the pawn, but as the next few moves show, she is incapable of doing so. this is a bit of a strange move, perhaps freeing up the g pawn? black is clearly winning. the game is over really, the rest is just mopping up and need few comments. many thanks for reading. please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system, to let me know how i am getting on. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
this is clearly a case of "trying too hard to win". having obtained a winning position i made one error. rather than admit that the position was now equal, and accept a perpetual check, being materially up, i tried to play on for a win and ended up getting mated! the grünfeld defence, also sometimes called the grünfeld-indian defence. the indian player moheschunder bannerjee played the opening as early as 1855 against john cochrane. however, it is named for ernst grünfeld, who introduced it into international tournament play at vienna 1922, where grünfeld, in his first game with the defense, beat future world champion alexander alekhine. and this is the exchange variation, the most common way of playing against it this move came back into vogue towards the end of the 20th century. bc4 followed by ne2 had been the more usual way of developing the white king side, preventing black from pinning the knight with bg4. with the knight on e2, this can just be met by f3 rb1 delays the development of the black bc8 as the pawn on b7 is attacked now that the pawn b7 has gone to b6 and is protected, i decided to prevent the pin with h3 black almost seems to be offering a draw. perhaps if i play bf4 black will play nh5 again and we can just repeat and agree a draw. but i have the white pieces, and a higher grade, i must play on! now his knight is short of squares what is this? black sacs the exchange. i was a bit surprised. what of it? i can just take it surely? now i am two exchanges up, and the black knight is still hanging. now i have got two alternatives. i should have just taken the knight and be winning on material. but i thought i could take on f7 and threaten mate. after the mate threat is dealt with, i can take the knight. i did actually at this stage look at the game continuation 27. qxf7 qc1+, 28. kg2 nf4+, 29. kf3 g5, 30. qf5+ and thought that qf5 was mate. i didn't see that the knight could then drop back and block the check. funnily enough there are quite a few cases in chess where strong players overlook knight moves jumping backwards, the most famous being when in 1956 future world champion petrosian left his queen en pris to a knight retreat from bronstein.
-------------------------------------
always likes to start out with  a pawn. i return with the pawn since that is how i start games. going on to a. pawn wall blocks the pawn in his tracks. so far  this has been a pawns game. no pieces lost.😀  then he decides to take that pawn. take that white something other that a pawn i might as well take that pawn dead evan this game so far knight wants to get into the game lost another pawn no big deal did move the knight. two times i.  a row opps  white really wants that knight out of the game really slow game we got here is this a fork or a pin got that bishop that causes problems out of the way. now goes back to a pawn. that is no use  in the game right now. being moving this knight a lot this game  trying to the pawn to the other end  i have a plan for this knight trying to get my knight out of the game. i have other plans for white  blocks the check for now got that queen out of the way whit forgot about my knight. i win. how is this a checkmate. 
-------------------------------------
i’m black here, and alex starts of with the king pawn opening. i respond with 1. ... e5. king’s gambit. risky for white because it opens up their kingside. a perfectly fine move stopping white from castling kingside (the bishop is guarding g1). also, note that if 3. fxe5, black responds with 3. ... qh4+! 4. g3 (if 4. ke2 qxe4#) qxe4 and black wins the rook. preventing qh4 and attacking e5 again. defending e5 bishop development, aiming at f7. pinning the f3 knight. the point here is to check on g5 after kxf7, but this trap actually does not work, due to the next moves. it seems like black’s lsb is gone, but... boom! and now white is in a pickle. i’m up by 2 points after kxe1. zwischenzug. probably best going for c7 pinned. chasing the knight away. threatening mate on f1. blunder. better was 15. d3 putting pressure on e7 guarding. didn’t see nf6+ greedy. i could have took the bishop here. up by 5, but it could have been 7, with rf1, followed by rxc1. but that removes the whole rook on 2nd effect. seriously? now the knight is free. okay... bxe3 is forced. blunderof the game. mate in 2. at this point, alex resigned, but this is what it would be like if he didn’t... checkmate! 
-------------------------------------
primera vez que juego un gambito evans de negras. variante bastante sólida, la conocía de una partida kasparov-anand no conocía esta movida. también d6 se ha jugado. buena movida, creo que después de esto, la partida queda más o menos parejas aunque objetivamente con más chances para las negras. jugada precipitada ya que me encontraba con menos de 10 minutos en el reloj. luego de unas cuantas escaramuzas y un juego más o menos correcto de ambos, se reestablece la igualdad de materia, pero las negras quedan activas. buena movida, pensé que me daría el triunfo, ya que calculé la variante que ganaba pieza, pero no en qué condiciones. con esta movida pensé que ganaba la partida. aquí ya es tablas, los peones fueron más peligrosos de lo que pensé. una buena partida por ambos bandos, con pocos errores y muy luchada 
-------------------------------------
creo que aquí era interesante c4 para las negras.  muy bien por alberto, que intenta simplificar para sacarles fuerzas a las blancas es importante controlar c5 para las blancas jugada que provoca la ruptura. las blancas dejan escapar cxd7 seguido de dc6 única y muy buena! por las casillas que controla el caballo la mejor era dc2, pero me daba la sensación que podía tener un fuerte ataque.  y ahora las negras tienen la iniciativa alberto encontró muy bien todas las jugadas de defensa si cg5, dxd3 y ganan alberto juega muy bien su caballo interesante jugada intermedia para evitar cualquier amenaza de mate y evitar g4, sacando ese molesto caballo para llegar a defender d3 y liberar la torre, pero alberto materializa su iniciativa forzando la ganancia del peon de d4 aquí las blancas cometen un error decisivo que facilita el trabajo de las negras, que están mejor. debieron jugar la sencilla tc2, ganando la única columna abierta del tablero alberto juega siempre la mejor! había mejores, pero me vine abajo psicológicamente. las blancas están perdidas las negras vuelven a tener un peon de ventaja grave error. ademas de cansado, yo estaba ya totalmente desmoralizado... el resto de la partida no tiene sentido volcarla aquí. muy bien jugado por alberto! 
-------------------------------------
de brancas jogo invariavelmente d4, me sinto mais segura do que e4! não conhecia muito bem esta variante e avaliei que ela não é a melhor. resolvi continuar com bg2 fianquetando o bispo e preparando meu roque! temendo a expansão na ala da dama resolvi  jogar a3 pelo menos meu adversário está pagando para ver! meu jogo flui naturalmente com lances naturais de desenvolvimento, nada que indique o uso de informações privilegiadas! tinha três  opções: bf4, cbd2 e cc3, não gosto da terceira mas como não poderia fazer c4 o natural optei por ele(cc3) retardo um pouco o bispo, pois com o centro móvel espero utilizá-lo em b2. a jogada da dama é segura e apoia e4 após d5 fechando a diagonal branca a casa e5 convida o bispo a f4 é notório que e4 é o lance de ruptura, por isso as torres devem ficar onde as colunas serão abertas!! retirando o cavalo da luta central e me fazendo ganhar um tempo o bispo retorna e a dama está livre, imagine se a dama estivesse em d1 pensei em jogar bf4 e avaliar qual o plano de meu adversário, mas como tenho lances interessantes, resolvo estabilizar a ala da dama! jogada defensiva afinal minhas peças apontam para roque de rcm06! o lance esperado, não posso mais esperar!! no meu cálculo essa posição da torre exposta ao lance do cavalo atacando a dama em b4 ou e5 me fez perder algum tempo!! trazendo a última peça ao campo de luta!! acredito ter uma pequena vantagem, quando olho as torres de meu adversário, equivalente a três tempos!! segundo meu professor de xadrez a todo momento tenho que olhar no campo adversário as peças soltas(sem defesa) e também se minhas peças estão defendidas, isso pode me valer mais alguns tempos!! liberando a dama da clausura e melhorando a posição do bispo, meu oponente faz o mesmo com seu bispo!! deixa a dama preta sob mira e evita g4 minhas peças solicitam um plano de ataque, tenho g4 e dama não tem uma casa confortável bem o peão de e6 paga um preço será meu alvo a ameaça as vezes é melhor que a execução!! o bispo corre em defesa do peão de e6 tenho três peças adversárias sem defesa!! almejando mais espaço e ameaçando g4! preparando-se para dobrar as torres e fazer pressão sobre f3 e f2 defendendo f3, e diminuindo o campo de manobra adversário! fazendo valer a ameça gxh6 e dando a torre opções de ataque na horizontal  resolvida a ruptura vamos aos planos derradeiros esse lance sempre me causou preocupação pois defende c7 e bispo age de forma crítica na diagonal c8-h2, joguei td3 me antecipando a bf4 e também preparando d5 não pude deixar de tomar em e6, avaliei as saídas do cavalo e não vi grandes problemas!! um peão de vantagem e trocas por acontecer, defendi quem poderia ficar solto iniciando o confronto as trocas a bem de uma ordem causam os mesmos estragos penso que meu adversário não avaliou corretamente  a resposta natural txf3 e se deixou levar somente por bxf3 - bxd2 # 32 te x d2  txf3 # 33 txf3 txf3  com uma peça a mais e uma posição ganhadora  bem txf5 e o preto não tem vantagem tenho um bispo contra um cavalo e uma estrutura de peões em melhor estado. a posição é simples, penso, vou ocupar a coluna aberta (e) com a torre, passar o rei para a ala da dama, manter o cavalo na defesa passiva dos peões das casas brancas!! meu adversário elogia meu jogo e envenena perguntando se não tenho um motor!! liberando o bispo e caminhando com o rei para o centro e ala da dama! talvez cortar o rei fosse melhor! se tivesse um motor saberia!! o cavalo vai a d6 e provavelmente a c4, resolvo tomar o peão oferecido e deixar as peças(cavalo e bispo) um tanto paralizadas. foi uma difícil decisão!! se cavalo for a c4 jogo a4! sinto ter deixado o rei passar!! se consigo trocar as torres fico bem, rcm06 não facilita!! não pretendo trocar desfazendo os peões dobrados, continuo a pressionar trocar  e aparecer um peão passado nem pensar!! ameaçando bxb4 olha as coisas melhorando! peão passado  na 6ª é sempre bom! vamos a caça!! meu adversário repete lances, enquanto caminho com o objetivo de trocar ou meu bispo pelo cavalo ou três peões pelo bispo!! tentando evitar o xeque em c4! se 49...- txf4  50 bxb5 o rei avança a torre sai da sexta para a terceira horizontal se deixar chegarei no paraíso!! ajudando não vale nova decisão: manter o bispo ou os peões, como matematicamente b< = b  e  p >= p,b,c,t e d!!  temos 5 peões pelo cavalo!! acredito que vou precisar de um motor!!!!!!! 
-------------------------------------
inizio ?? fino a qui tuuto bene... ancora tuuto bene(tranne f6) argh!qui dh5# non se ne accorto... certe volte rimpiango di avergli insegnato a giocare a scacchi il senso sarebbe di spostare il cavallo come avevo detto... non serve a niente(8 dxa8 o spero dh5) certe volte anche se dopo molto però sono contento di avergli insegnato a giocare a scacchi 
-------------------------------------
the standard sicillian opening, that players like to mix move order or use other variations, c3, bc4 nc6 so the opponent doesn't get too comfortable. here nf6 is attacking undefended e4 pawn. white develops and defends, black move protects b5 square from b and n and also prepares a queenside pawn attack. black was in two minds to move pawn e6 or e5. black is rethinking his opening repertoire and moving from scheveningen (e6) to a more aggressive najdorf (e5) (pron. najdorf).  black also believes a player shouldn't use openings where you have to look up the spelling for. a few options for the white knight.  so opening books prefer nb3, for a while i din't understand why the knight would run so far away from the action (a knight that's now moved 3 times aswell).  someone like andrás adorján may applaud nf5.  but on this occasion black saw that the d1-h5 diagonal was blocked, so attempted to take advantage. some developing black in particular is defending the hole on d5 with 8.be6. is ng4 too early? still a couple of obvious development moves black can do.  if black has undeveloped two rooks and one knight and a central king, where can white get some compensation? i would have preferred the forcing 10. bxe7 white has to keep up with captured material. black invites the h-file to be opened.  white still has some counter-play leave well alone.  an alternative 14. qxd6 keeps black thinking and puts a hole in an open h-file plan. black had to think was there enough time for white if black moved the queen to the h-file. unbelievably black moved to the wrong square.  15....qh5 protects the e5 pawn and stops immediate safe checks.  white has no time for anything else. 16.f3 g3, 16.rfd1 qh1#.  after the game black said they wanted to be pretty and keep everything on the dark squares. rightly white starts they're bid was at least a draw. nicely done. if white next moves 20.qh3 and the following exchanges.   it may not equalise positionally, but white will still have good chances. again, white needs to move the rf1 somewhere else.  and survive a king hunt. perhaps hoping black missed the checkmate.  it does happen.  black missed earlier moves.

eelnevad käigud on tehtud suhteliselt kiiresti - siin aga vajusin suht kiire ajakontrolli juures natuke mõttesse. kaalusin erinevaid variante ja järgnes sellest käigust ei saanud minu arvuti vähemalt alguses küll kohe absoluutselt aru. aga kui paar käiku veel tegin hakkas ta aru saama mis laual tegelikult toimub. nagu näha siis musta kuningal ei ole enam lihtne kuhugi varju pääseda. iga hetk võib valla pääseda b2 oda ja e6 välja saab veel täiendavalt c4 kaudu rünnata. tolleks hetkeks oli mul kella peal ainult 5-10seki ja mängisin ainult tänu lisasekundite abile. ei olnud lihtne seda oda kahida, aga tundus et vf7 tapab kui c4 lüüakse. see käik meeldis mulle eriti.  hakkab matt tulema. vanker on veel üle, aga matist pole pääsu. omamoodi huvitav muidugi, et partii lõppes nii nagu lõppes. tule peale panin mati. seda ei juhtu just väga tihti.

jim has told me that he was an e4 player, who stuck to main lines, so i was expecting an open sicilian. according to plan. i expected this. and this is my usual. already slightly unusual, but perfectly playable. deepblue chess computer beat kasparov with this line. i have also played e6 in this position, transposing into the french defence, and also d5, both without great success, so i play this now (with some success!). i was interested to find out later, that nf6 does indeed score better on the opening databases. this was unexpected, but i have seen it before. i remember an article in an old "chess" magazine recommending this move. the idea is to later retreat the bishop to c2 and play d4, with a strong centre, and to handle it a bit like a spanish opening, or a ruy lopez as we english often call it. but this moves seems to me to cut across white's plans. if white exchanges on d5 it will be hard to force d4 and white is left with a backward d pawn. i was pleased to see on the opening databases after the game that this is indeed black's best reply. so he doesn't take, but advances. i wanted to play ng4, without allowing him to play bb5 followed by d4, securing his centre. i was pleased to see that my reply is in fact the most popular, although perhaps not the most successful so he retreats i carry on with my plan. he protects e5 so i attack it again and he protects it indirectly by pinning my knight. i spent a while looking at this position. i looked at bf5 with the idea of bd3. the problem is that he has 9. nd4 and then bd3 is met with qxg4. i also looked at 9. nd4 nxe5 10. nxf5 nd3+ but came to the conclusion that black has not enough to justify the sacrifice. i was interested to find out later that there were a couple of over-the-board games with bf5 9. nd4 bxb1 10. qxg4 bd3 when f4 was 0-1 in davydov, sergey… (2249) vs. weetik, vjaches… (2436) and e6 was 1-0 in  moreda, lucas (2329) vs. della morte, pa… (2350)  so i played this move instead, threatening to play b5, lifting the pin and winning the pawn e5. in the gameknot opening databases there are no examples of this move, although there are two with bd7, with similar ideas. i think this is more-or-less forced. i thought it better to take back with the pawn and strenghten my centre and keep the pressure on e5. he castles i play this move to delay, or stop, d4 or d3, which can be met with taking on d3, followed by ba6. so he kicks the knight. i retreat and he makes a beginner's mistake so i take he takes thanks for the exchange! he advances i take he takes back and now i make a big mistake. i was afraid of him exchanging on h6 and ruining my pawn formation. however i should have played nf5 now i have problems completing my development. more or less forced, if i still have dreams of castling one day. hitting my queen so i offer an exchange of queens. when material ahead, it is usually good to exchange pieces but not pawns. he avoids the exchange i throw in a check he moves to the logical square i offer another exchange of queens. now according to the shredder program, after 20. qxb5 cxb5 21. na3 the position is even. it prefers nf5 and black still has the upper hand.
-------------------------------------
white decides to take the d-pawn with his queen instead of playing the morra gambit. (3.c3) )...a questionable because he now must waste a move getting the queen to safety while i am allowed to develop my knight with tempo. i think 4...nf6, 5.nc3, e6, 6. nf3, bb4 is more common but i guess it’s just a matter of taste. in a rated match, i would most probably play 4...nf6, but blitz matches provide a great opportunity to try out new lines. because it does not block the path of the bishop, 6. nc3 is clearly better. a positional mistake? my opponent now forfeits a potentially strong bishop pair and by letting me put a pawn on c6, helps me control the central d5 square. some of us are guilty, especially in blitz games, for making quiet moves until either we can think of something to do or wait until our opponent shows his hand. a3 is one of these moves. another of these moves is h3. although h3 often provides an escape route for the kingside castled king, surely it is better to attempt a firm control on the centre/develop all of our pieces before our opponent has the chance to do this, and only play h3 should we be in definite danger of being back-rank mated? fritz gives this moves a question mark: i will be able to attack the knight with tempo. when playing with a fianchettoed king-side bishop, black often has the positional advantage if he can play d5 at some point with no repercussions. this was definitely the case in this game. playing d5 now offers a lovely position for black in comparison with white’s. unfortunately, i did not consider 10...d5!? at this stage. instead, fritz suggests ...11. qa5+, 12. bd2, qa4, which wins a pawn and also offers black good chances on the queenside. see what i mean about these sorts of moves? what exactly does 12. h3 achieve? it would take a lot of wated effort on my part to get into a position where i can put my bishop on g4 so why bother defending it? finally. i'm in love with this position. my king is safe, my knight is on a great square, and my pieces look dangerous against my opponent's queenside. surely a mistake. this offers my bishop a very powerful square and will lead to the loss of a pawn. if instead 17. qc3, the right move is 17...rxc2. after the queen takes, the rook, bxc2 ensures black will recover at least the h-rook. if 18. rd1, 18. qb8 if 18. rh2, qa5+ with qe5+ to follow. if 19. qd1, rd8+, 20.kc1, qe1+, and unless the queen does not sacrifice herself immediately, 21. kb2, rb2+, 22.qe6, with a forced queen sac and mate to follow.  i was rather chuffed that i spotted this in a blitz game. necessary, otherwise the king can slip to safety to g2 once his queen has moved. not strictly necessary but when in incremental blitz games, it never hurts to get more time, especially when one can take a pawn in doing so. 22 rfb8 pretty much does the job, but there’s actually a rather nifty mate in 8!: 22. rd8!!, 23. qg5, rd1+, 24. rxb1, qxb1+, 25. qc1, qxc1+, 26. ke2, qd1+, 27. ke3, qd3+, 28. kf4, rd4+, 29. kg5, f6+, 30. kh6, rh4++ if 24. qg4, i most probably would have played 24...rxd1+, 25. qxd1, rb1. however, another move is better because it forces mate in 7. can you spot it and the mate? 27. it’s over, my opponent recognises this, and resigns. 
-------------------------------------
1.e4 - the game starts with a very uncommon move by white. black is confused and decides to copy whites move. white puts a quick end to blacks hopes of copying evey move and plays 2.d4, preventing the symmetric response, because in case black would play d5 now, white can simply take the pawn on e5 pinning black´s d5 pawn to black´s queen. so black simply decided to take the pawn here... but he missed, that white had the simple, still genious move qxd4. in that way white succeded in tying down black´s bishop to the defense of his g7-pawn, black´s rook to the denfense of the a7-pawn and black´s bishop, queen and king !!! to the defense of the d7-pawn...an awesome move!!!! black decided to move one of his view pieces which can still move and attacks the queen. but the white queen didn´t get intimidated by that. she simply approaches the black knight....and the black king!! black tries to catch the queen again with his other knight. but it´s hopeless.... white´s queen just goes back and forth, back and forth provoking an over-extansion of black´s pieces. and black doesn´t see the trap!!!! here white missed something. he should have played 8.qxg7, what would have resulted in the the trade of black´s pawn against white´s queen. well, white would have lost the exchange, but would have had more than enough compensation, because of black´s weak pawn-structure. (isolated f and h pwans) black becomes aware of the fact, that his defense has been weakened too much and retreats with his knight to add protection to the b8-square. but too late...white´s attack had just started. nice try by black...unfortunately he missed, that his a6-pawn is pinned to his rook and therefore can´t defend the b5-pawn. black is in a bad psychological state. so he simply decides to take on b5 and sacrifice his rook. or maybe he thought the queen is worth more than the rook. lots of beginning players actually do think the so, but recent scientific research has proven, that this is nothing but a myth. the queen might be able to move diagonally, but that´s not really an advantage for a couple reasons:
-------------------------------------
 1. if you don´t pay attention the queen is way more likely than the rook to stalemate your opponents king in the endgame.
-------------------------------------
 2. the queen starts the game very close to the center of the field, where she can get under fire very easily. but the rooks start at the corner of the board where they can easily attack both flanks of your opponent´s army.
-------------------------------------
 3. last but not least the rook-pair has proven very strong in lots of chess games. unfortunately it´s usually not possible to have a queen-pair early in the game. for the reasons mentioned above, white traded his queen against black´s rook and is up the exchange. here white got rid of blacks pawns, which are potential rooks in the endgame. since a knight can never become a rook in the endgame, white decided to trade it off, too. white won 2 (potentional) rooks for only 1 knight. the first time in the game that white missed something.  now it´s all about saving king charles!! white opens a discovered attack on black´s bishop, while the knight is heading towards balck´s king. it´s only 4 moves away from delivering check now. a very loose move. black becomes greedy and takes on a2. the move might have won a pawn, but also weakened black´s back rank. black now starts to mess arround, because he doesn´t see any concrete plan, while white builds up his defense structure. black couldn´t take the pressure anymore and decided to sacrivice his bishop. the pressure on black´s king might seem overwhelming, but in my oppinion black´s still fine and might be able to draw this game. it´s just black´s moves from now on, that ruined his game. centralizing the bishop, while black´s queen is stuck in the corner. i hope you can see that black might be up in material, but his pieces are barely activated. most of them hanging arround on the rim of the board. white instead had already finished the developpment of his pieces, which are placed very central. attacking the pawn on b5. actually i still think black might have won this game at that point, but he simply didn´t think about bringing his king into the game, which is a crucial misstake in the endgame.
-------------------------------------
no ano passado eu enfrentei tarcísio,se nao me engano também na quarta rodada,de pretas.na ocasião eu refleti  um bocado pra jogar 1-cf6 e convidá-lo a entrar numa alekhine.o convite foi prontamente recusado com um 2-cc6,e  entramos numa empatosa abertura dos 4 cavalos,onde erro de cá e erro de lá,dividimos o ponto. agora,minha preparação psicológica mandava eu jogar uma variante nimzovich,com 2-cf6. num torneio em abril  em comemoração ao aniversário da pm,salve engano,sob o tempo de reflexão de 15 minutos nocaute,empreguei  com suceso essa variante contra ele, embora eu tenha penado um pouco.a primeira partida pensada que  jogamos foi num cimax de 2007,eu,de pretas,joguei uma pirc e entreguei uma peça de graça.a primeira partida  decisiva de torneio entre nós foi jogada em 2005,nos jogos estudantís da serra(jes) e foi ele quem empregou  a dragão!a partir daí e de umas partidas com adenílton que hoje está em alguma cidade satélite do df,comecei  tentar domar esse animal mitológico que segundo a história deu nome à abertura por causa do mestre russo fiodor  dus chotimirski que era astronomo e se encantara com a constelação a ponto de homenageá-la com uma abertura de  xadrez,e vice-versa.tarrasch também já jogou isso e venceu;só não sei se ela já tinha sido batizada . foi esse  torneio por acaso, o primeiro torneio que eu vencí, vencí invicto e nem ví o troféu.o pessoal da escola não me  falou da data da cerimônia de entrega da premiação quando fiquei sabendo já tinha passado.fui lá na secretaria  municipal de educação buscar a premiação mas parece que já tinham  dado pra outra pessoa!!!que sacanagem! eu pensei em jogar um gambito marshall,mas fiquei em dúvida se ele aceitaria.uma petrov provavelmente levaria a uma  outra abertura dosquatro cavalos e eu não estava muito a fim de empatar.há algum tempo levei minha francesa pra  oficina e ainda não fui buscar.só me restou a velha carcamana.  um lance característico da "escola serrana".não sei se o fianqueto do rei preto contra o peão do rei  começou com benigno ou com bianchi,porque quando apareci eles já jogavam isso.só sei que de uns tempos pra cá  o pessoal daqui tá gostando de se defender assim,seja com a india do rei com a moderna ou com a pirc. desde minha partida na final do municipal de 2005 onde iniciei com 1.a3 e hudson respondeu com 1.g6,ele também  virou um cara índio do rei na sua versão mais radical.só joga isso tanto e brancas quanto de pretas.interessante  que  isso deve ser contagioso,porque paulo césar vieira seu companheiro de pings da madrugada e até humberto  de vila velha aderiram a esse sistema de brancas. aqui eu enfrentei mais um dilema:pensei que meu dragão estivesse muito manjado,e não sabia se jogava  a6,e6 ou cc6 pra fugir da rotina.não resistí à tentação. aqui eu costumo jogar 9...d5! vide a partida contra carlos alberto em postagem anterior.não o fiz por causa  de uma sequenciazinha chata que tarcísio joga e que eu tive preguiça de estudar com 10-cxc6,seguido de  e e5.deixa  pra próxima... h4:nosso último encontro anterior a essa partida foi numa copa serrana de 21 minutos.respondi  com 11...h5 e venci já sou doido;o cabelo ajuda... por essa ele não esperava.interessate é que eu joguei isso com esevandro numa copa serrana  que tarcísio não estava presente.josielton,ao final da partida,fez um comentário engraçado sobre  os dois únicos peões brancos que sobraram,e que estavam dobrados em c2 e c3.  tudo igual aqui.a única maneira de as brancas conseguirem vantagem é preservando a qualidade; mas a sombra que esse cavalo tava fazendo aí era de fazer medo mesmo.  aqui,o gm inglês christopher ward que na época tinha um elo de 2490 jogou 21...b6  e empatou em 54 lances com o gm chinês wang zili,de 2530,no eng-chn,disputado em londres,no ano de 1997.  bh5? eu estou louco para jogar f5,e podia fazer isso.aqui o fritz dá um = de (0.12)  o lance do texto me dá um certo conforto psicológico,mas o fritz diz que é um erro grave, que dá uma vantagem de (1.09) pras brancas.nesse ponto minha cabeça já estava quente. bf6?!-aqui ele trava tenta literalmente cercar o meu rei;eu fiquei tão preocupado que não vi que tf4, segundo o fritz,iguala pra = (0.06) (0.91) de vantagem pras brancas vantagem de (-0.78) pras pretas. as pretas viraram o jogo e agora tem (-1.37) há males que vem pra bem.se não fosse o erro do bh5 eu não teria ganho agora \o/  \o/  \0/  \0/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/ \o/  / \  /\   ||   / \ / \ /\  / \ /\  / \ / \  /\ / \ /\  / \ / \ / \  / \ / \ /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ /\   /\  /\  /\  brancas abandonam e mais uma vez a teoria do karpov se confirma,quando ele diz que no xadrez vence  quem comete o penúltimo erro,já que o único geralmente é decisivo. welington ,que circundava a mesa e assistia à partida,havia pensado que tarcísio  havia ganho até o momento dos cumprimentos.torrezani,que também assistia perguntava quem havia ganho. depois desse jogo,todos pensavam que o torneio havia sido decidido ali.

i was rather happy to see this move since i like better to play against e4. i was more hoping for ruy lopes and perhaps play the marshall gambit or even the open variation that i have played on few occassions but the problem was that i did not have any opening repertoire as black against e4 or any other first move by white. i know nothing about 3.bc4 and the italian game so therefore i played this move and was hoping that black would not play ng5 or d4 and thankfully white choose a quiet continuation. i must admit that i don´t quite understand this move and looks like time wasting move to me, but i guess white wants to bring his bishop to c2. here i was expecting castling and this move came as a complete surprise to me, but not a bad move in my mind. dubious move and i must admit that i completely missed white next move otherwhise i would probably have taken the knight. here i thought for long time. i saw that i will lose a pawn, f.e. qd7 11.bxe6 fxe6 12.qb3 or bxb3 11.qxb3. but i thought that i will get my changes for the pawn and it is a question whether white can afford the time to grab the pawn as he is already behind in development.  as i said earlier it is dubious whether white should take this pawn. after this move i am much further in development, all my pieces are out, i have castled and the rooks are connected. furthermore my rook stands well on the e-file aiming at the king and the queen stands well on the soon to open up d-file. white on the other hand have not yet castled, his pieces are not out and his queen is in bad position and will need few moves to get back to safety. not sure this is a good move but it is difficult to suggest a good move for white. this position is much easier to play for black. threatening the d-pawn and it can hardly be saved. if 16.bxf4 then exf4 opens up the e-file and looks like a sure win for black. kb1 was probably better. now the queen is in danger of getting trapped. securing the knight on its excellent square. mistake, but it is already lost for white anyway. now i can finish the game in couple of moves. only square for the queen, otherwise it would have been 19...rxb7#. threatens the bishop and winning the queen with ra5. threatens the knight and also forking the rooks among all kinds of other threats so white resigned. actually after the pawn sacrifice on b7 it was a very easy game to play and you could say that the game played itself out.  
-------------------------------------
carlsen also plays 1. e4 but somehow i have the feeling that when he is trying to win a game he is more likely to pick 1.d4.  with this move order, white is maybe trying to avoid the main lines of the gruenfeld, which is the main opening of caruana.  black has a wide range of options here and the move order is very important. this move is of course not the main one and carlsen was probably trying to avoid the main theory. [5.c4 cxd4 6.nxd4 would lead us to one of the very popular lines.]  maybe not the most exact way to continue for black.  [i am wondering why caruana did not go for 5...cxd4 6.cxd4 d5 7.0–0 0–0 8.ne5 e6 as this symmetrical line is considered very harmless for black.]   ! why not take a pawn if you can! now the game is getting very complicated. white is going to be a pawn up, but black will dominate the center.  before the action, both players secure their kings' positions.  good and ty pical play. of course white's main idea could be to play b4 to secure the c5 pawn and also to develop strong play on the queenside. now white needs to look for a plan to hold the c5 pawn and to develop his bishop on c1 and knight on b1.  white found a nice plan with be3–qc1. this is not only giving white the possibility of playing bh6 at some moment, but also to bring the rook into the game with rd1. after this move white will definitely not have any trouble to keep the c5 pawn alive. [an interesting try could have been 8...ng4!? 9.bd4 (after 9.bd2 na6 black is perfectly fine.) 9...e5 now the game is getting forced. 10.h3 exd4 11.hxg4 dxc3 12.nxc3 bxg4 white is a pawn up, but the bishop pair should give black very good chances to hold. 13.qxd5 qxd5 14.nxd5 na6 i think that maybe white is minimally better, but objectively the game should end in a draw.]  black's main idea could be to play e5 and in that case white is going to bring his knight over b5 to d6.  maybe caruana was slightly worried about white's qa4–qh4 maneuver.  here we see the main idea of white's 8.be3.  the position is still very complicated, but white's chances are probably already better.  of course the white knight is going to d6.  black tries to be solid. ! a strong move. with this tactical idea, white is gaining a tempo.  the point is that black cannot take the pawn on e2.  [14...bxe2? doesn't work because of 15.rxd5! nxd5 16.bxd5 and white is winning because of the pressure on the f7 pawn.]  the position is still very complicated. white slowly needs to try and get some play on the queenside as black is just too solid in the center.  it is hard to say if this move was really needed. maybe it was more simple to play 16.qd2–qe1, securing things even more on the kingside.  ?! a very logical move, but i think it is too early as now black is getting excellent chances to get back into the game. [17.ne1 with the idea of playing nc2 and maybe nb4 could have stabilized white's advantage.]  now the position is getting very dynamic.  ! an excellent move! black is making his dream idea to play the f5 move come true!  white didn't have a better move.  [of course black is just doing great after 20.nxe4? dxe4 21.nd2 f5]   ? caruana is missing an excellent chance. [after 20...nxd6 21.cxd6 qd7 black's position is looking solid, but maybe white could still be slightly better.; but after 20...d4! white could already be the one who's in trouble! 21.n2xe4 dxe3 22.fxe3 white is 2 pawns up, but black's play is very direct and dangerous. 22...f5 23.nd2 qg5 24.nf1 e4 and i think black has full compensation for the lost material. the control over the dark squares, an attack on the kingside as well as the "dead" white bishop on g2 give black excellent chances.]  white exchanged on e4 and managed to keep the monster knight on d6.  ! i think this is a great move. white is not only preparing to push b4–b5 but also playing against the f4 move by putting extra pressure on e4.  black has nothing else left, caruana needs to try his chances in the attack.  ! another good defensive move by white, the bishop is going to be a great protector on e1.  ?! after this move black's chances to survive are becoming very small. [maybe the best move was 24...exf2+ 25.bxf2 fxg3 26.bxg3 qg5 27.kh2 and now the tricky 27...e4 trying to open the position as much as possible. of course white is better here, but black would still keep practical chances.]  [i think that after 25.nxf5 gxf5 (25...rxf5 26.g4 gives white a huge edge.) 26.g4! white's position is looking close to winning.]  caruana wants to activate the bishop from g7 over the h6 square, but he is just not in time.  ! a strong move. white has a very nice positional idea in mind...  this is what caruana was playing for, but white has an ace in his pocket...  ! this is exactly the move that refutes black's 25...h5.  ! another excellent move. white stops black fom getting any kind of play on the kingside.   after some exchanges, white is still a healthy pawn up.  i guess this move ends all of black's hopes. the bishop on g7 is dead now and the black king is maybe even weaker than the white one. all white needs to do is to play b4–b5 and creat a passed pawn. 31...f4 is not any better.  good and solid. everything is protected and white can start thinking about the b4–b5 push.  the pawn on h5 is under attack.  and the white pawns start to roll. white's position is totally winning.  a practical decision. in a lost position caruana at least tries to activate his pieces to have some theoretical chances for some tricks. once again everything is protected and the white pieces are controling the board.  this move already clearly shows that the game is over.  so move 40 has been reached and white is 2 pawns up, the black king could find himself under some serious attack soon and another big problem is the c6 pawn, which just seems to be unstoppable. white is bringing his knight to b5 to end what he started, to queen the c-pawn. and the c7 move already cannot be stopped.  another accurate move.  white is a full queen up and after 49...qa1 white has the simple 50.rd1. we saw a very interesting and fighting game with a lot of different ideas. with this victory, carlsen grabbed another 1st place in one of the world's strongest tournaments. 
-------------------------------------
let´s try something new,,, sounds suspicious, but... for the sake of making some pressure (?) maybe bb4 was better , looking for a quick castling. now ndb5 creates a lot of pain in black´s defenses but now i have that problem resolved. maybe ot the strongest position to play the bishop, but a safe move anyways black has gained a time here.  9.bd3 seems more active strong position for the knight. ...but creates a strong attack on the kings side (!?) i found this move interesting, even after finishing the game. but it may have been a wrong one, since it seems white has compensation. at any rate, in a blitz game it is difficult to find the best defense. if 13,bxc3; o-o seems safe enough with a fair position for black. i was looking for a rook´s sacrifice, moving queen outside, but saw no compensation, no mate or attack for the rook. with the idea of pressuring white´s castling and at the same time castling on the other side, with strong attack through g column. maybe too early, considering incoming attack. i thought 16. c4 saved the day for white. 16.bxh7 seems too risky, but it may also do the job. a mistake, but not easy to see black threats qxf1+, gaining the bishop for free if white´s is not taken to a safe place. bishop joins the attack. black has the upper hand, can´t see a good defense for white.  i was running out of time here, and though to keep safe e6, seeing nothing better, but maybe i should have added both rooks to the g column. anyways, didn´t see qa7, i reckon it was a lucky move for next sacrifice. i felt i had just given white a small chance to counterattack on my king´s wing.   but i saw a nice combination beutiful. as far as bishop controls a8-h1, black seems safe enough and opening g column makes me look for a mate, which i didn´t see in sucha short period, but it seemed clear to me that white had no defense. i considered 22.rf2, then  rg8+ will make a quick check mate. but kh3 was more a pain, since rook does not go to g with a check. but as i said before, as far as i have the bishop controlling h1-a8, i can prepare the attack carefully. therefore, 22.kh3, rg8 threatening qg2+ and mate should suffice. in case of 23. rg1, then is mate with ...qxf3+ 24. rg3, qa5++ so, as a summary, not a great game (horrible opening), but an interesting and beautiful finish 
-------------------------------------
weakens the centre, but i kind of like the english-sicilian approach wasn´t sure to open a fianchetto here, to counteract black bishop´s position. i think it helps holding the position although it requires one extra movement. but since black has already spent two pawn moves before, it seems right. black could have also attempted to develop a fianchetto, but it may require too many moves. on the other hand centre is solid and there is no clear requirement to me for casting for either player. wasted movements, but it seems white didn´t take much advantage of it. a stronger response to aatack the right wing was required, but didn´t see a clar approach to perform such attack. on the other hand, keeping preassure on the left wing also seems right. maybe 11.f5 was a better choice, as said before; attacks the right wing and/or opens the centre. not sure if i had to expose the flank so soon. not a clear gain in prospect, but time flyes. with the intention to do f5 and take the centre with the knight or leave a weakened pawn in e6.   to me black started to do the correct movements now, considering how delicate is the position. attacking white´s centre as a counterattack is a golden rule that he exploited very well. on the other hand, pressure on his king´s defenses is high. i thought about giving up the centre and focus on attacking, but without much results. unfortunately, i didn´t see the 18...ne5 that helps winning time . now i feel black has the upper hand. white´s left flank in contested with b5 and bf6 is weak, and the centre is also lost. not a clear attack on black´s king compensates anything. not sure if this is best for black, but it doesn´t seem bad. rook on 8th line still is a valuable defensive piece.  as said before, black´s bf6 with b5 make the white position a very delicate, if not a lost, one. this is the only movement i could see it gave white a chance. maybe not to win but at least to create danger and confusion. draw is the price to aim for now and it doesn´t seem and easy one, but better than trying to hold the position without the sacrifice. it negates any chances of mate. why not 25...rab8 !? or even a more active one sacrificing the rooklike qe5; keyboard or mouse issues may explain this movement. or he just didn´t see those. rook is lost best, to avoid loosing the rook ? not a clear continuation. time and position doesn´t help either. ?? 32...rd1+ saves the game. i didn´t even see that on the game either. i guess we were both too focused on the black´s king. i consider the game finished here. i am not adding the result, since i just wanted to share what i thought it was an interesting game with both errors and good moves, very fun to play. 
-------------------------------------
kings pawn game still there we go what this developing another one attack ha!   unpinning a piece i was waiting for that then this! back? queen out this   you are not pinning a piece! there we go castle     how about this...   and that? you are letting me take your bishop? okay then   knew it go back! of course you would do that! hay!! how did rest of the game is in chinese??? 我现在做一个兵打 不好的... oh thank goodness! it is english again!  threatening the pawn  easy to defend what is that for? are you ready? uh no attack!! ??? there we go good one! how about this? hay! using the other rook using back rank this? ha you fell into my trick r o o k for the win! this thank you for this really? ha! ha! checkmate! thanks for watching my annotation and please rate more than three stars and see you guys next time! good bye!!!!!  
-------------------------------------
this is so called veresov opening which i play frequently and a good one for lazy people who don´t like to study openings. the idea is to play e4 as soon as possible. usual play in the veresov is 2...d5 3.bg5 and then many options for black but quite often it transposes to french defense by 3...e6 4.e4 which i like to play. before the game i had a feeling that my opponent might answer with this move since he liked to play benoni and the benkö gambit and found an interesting continuation i had prepared for him. so far everything going according to plan. and still everything going to plan and my opponent did hardly think for a second before playing this. look dubious since after bxf2 my king will become exposed and it also lock my pieces inside but i have a surprise for him. looks like he have gotten the piece back with much better position but my next move was probably a surprise for him. exchange sacrifice but the black queen will be out of play for the rest of the game and i will get an unstoppable mating attack. threatens mate on e7 and also defends the h2 pawn and therefore preventing the black queen from escaping through there. so black is up an exchange and two pawns but all his pieces are inactive, his queen will soon be imprisoned inside the white camp and his king is vulnerable. white on the other hand have an excellent queen and the knight and the black squared bishop will soon join in on the attack against the black king. now the queen is completely out of the game and i bring another piece in on the attack. here i spent maybe 20-30 minutes or so since i felt that forced checkmate should be there and i was also rather excited how well this game was progressing. i also think this is the best move, it threatens checkmate and bring another piece in the attack against the king. the third piece join in on the attack against the king. the idea with this move is to free the queen by closing the h2-d6 diagonal but there is no time to bring here back in the game. here i thought for maybe 5-10 minutes since i wanted to find a forced checkmate. qxf6 wins also but nxf6 is a forced checkmate in few moves. here black resigned. he will be checkmated after f.e. 14...qxh2 15.qc7 ke8 16.nf6# or 14...ke8 15.qf6 altough checkmate is not so obvious after 15...d6 but it is a lost position for black after 16.qxh8. 
-------------------------------------
(?!) not sure what else... black seems to have everything under control. white threats with h5 didn´t see the check... now rxd5 or bxd5 threat... no way out for the king  
-------------------------------------
this is a really exciting game, with sides castling on opposite sides, and both throwing everything at the opposition king. i think with hindsight, i was far too optimistic, because of the success this opening variation had achieved in the past, and my opponent, who combines beauty with brains, found good defensive moves and then good attacking moves when the initiative had passed to her. enjoy dear reader! first, a note on my opponent. i have played her 23 times on gameknot, over the last two years. for some reason she has lost access to her gameknot account, so we played on facebook, by sending each other messages of what move we wanted to play. so i set up the usual d4-e4 pawn centre against her modern defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_defense she completes the fianchetto. i rule out any transposition to the king's indian defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence this is normally played. i develop. she attacks e4 and also threatens nf6-g4. i rule that out, and i now have a pawn structure similar to the king's indian defence, sämisch variation, except my c pawn is on c2 rather than c4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence,_s%c3%a4misch_variation for this reason, it is called the pseudo-samisch centre by some authorities. has this lady no fear? this is rather castling into the strong white attack. 5....c6 is more popular, and scores better from black on the opening databases, compared to 5...0-0  so i prepare 0-0-0 and launching a king-side attack. she prepares queen-side counter play. off my king goes. and out her queen comes. while i immediately set about exchanging one her strongest pieces - the bishop on g7, as part of an attack on her king. and her attack comes too. charge! she attacks my knight. knight drops back. she quietly develops rather than picking up my a pawn. charge again! she takes. note how the black queen helps defend along the 5th rank. at this point she asked for help. i told her how in the gameknot world opening database there were two games with this position, both of which black took back with the king and white won. so she took back with the knight, just to be different. it was the only time in the game she asked for help. this seemed the natural attacking move. after the game, i found out that fritz also likes g4, but eventually settles on qh6 and assesses the position as slightly better for black. i was feeling very confident, and thought that black would be lucky to survive the attack. the knight comes over to protect h7. clearly this is the best move. i thought this was best, attacking and developing and also protecting a2. fritz prefer g4 and still gives black the edge. fritz at first prefers be6 or rd8, but after a while also looks at d5 i thought this was just winning. i missed her next move. fritz likes bb3 instead, with advantage to white. fritz now puts black 1 pawn up i wanted to keep the pressure on the h file. fritz prefers nh5 and thinks that this move hands the advantage back to white. naturally i take, renewing the threat to take on h7 with mate. this is the best defence. i attack again. she calmly just takes the a pawn. fritz prefers exf6. now - should i take knight or pawn? this is another mistake. i should have either taken the knight or played f6xe7. this hands the advantage back to her, fritz put it at more than plus 1 to black. we both thought this was forced as otherwise white is mating black down the h file. fritz however points out the benefits of 19....c3! and black has her own mating threats.  the game is more or less level again. she takes back. fritz also likes 20....re8 here. fritz also considers 21. h6 and 21. qd2 forking the pawns on g5 and b4. this is strong, the knight takes up a powerful central position. however fritz likes the immediate c3. so i get my pawn back. clearly the best square, avoiding checks on the long dark diagonal.  developing my knight at last. fritz agrees that this is the best move for white. i was starting to think black had an advantage her. fritz thinks so too, about plus 0.5 to black. she attacks my queen. again fritz points out that c3 could have been played at once. my queen takes up a central position, but without much support, she is unable to achieve much. at last the bishop is developed. i contest the open g file. fritz doesn't think much of that move and looks at qe4+, rh2 and h6. black's advantage put at plus 3.59, after what it considers the best move, h6. fritz considers this best. i take. a sound move attacking my queen. this seemed to me to be the logical move, although i feared i was about to be overwhelmed on the queen-side. fritz thinks that white should give up the queen instead with 27. rxg8. the reality of the position is that white is lost now, and i chose to play this and live in hope that she would not spot the winning technique on the queen-side. certainly giving up the queen is almost equivalent to resignation. there are many ways to win now. this is one of them. the mate threat is 28....qxc2 virtually the only way to stop the mate threat. the other move 28. nf4 is met with 28....nxf4 and i can't take back with my queen, as i get mated on c2. she takes, with some nasty threats on the queen-side. fritz agrees that this is best. probably best out of some dreadful options. interesting way to finish off. i play this rather than letting my knight go with check. it is mate in 5 now. kd2 holds out slightly longer, but i decided to take the bishop. ok dear reader, although i played on two more moves, (but not quite to mate) i will leave the annotation here, and leave you to find the forced mate in three. do not spoil it for others - send me a private message with the answer. many thanks for reading, please rate it on the star system, and leave a message or two to let me know how i am doing with my annotations. until next time dear reader!

루이 로페즈는 어느 정도 자신이 있습니다. 피셔의 대국을 줄창 복기한 까닭이겠지요... 오호, 색다르게 나오네요. 과거에 패배한 적도 있어서 책 참조와 분석을 해 둔 적이 있습니다. '강하게' 두어야 한다는 기억이 납니다. 이렇게. f8비숍을 배치하기 힘들죠...  ...c5를 두면 d폰이 뒤로 밀리게 되고. 이래저래 f6에 나이트 없는게 이렇게 말립니다. 일단 저지르지 않는 안전한 수로. 여기서 주의할 점이, 이른바 '노아의 방주' 함정에 걸리지 않는 것이죠. ...b5도 가능하지만, 그걸 유도하는 수인데...   과연 흑이 그걸 두었다면 약점일지 장점일지?  흑에게 장점이라면 백 비숍을 쫓으면서 폰을 밀고 공간을 확보 했다는 점이고,  단점이라면 과대팽창이겠죠. 흑의 폰 움직임이 좀 많군요. 좀 고민하다가 nc3. f1룩이 그 자리에 있어야 할 수도 있으니... 자, 이 시점에서 인간 두뇌의 판단으로는 '백이 아주 유리하다'라고 볼 수 있죠.  백은 캐슬을 했고 나온 기물이 3개.  흑은 기물 하나만 나왔고, d6폰이 약하죠. ...c5-c4로 비숍을 노리는 수입니다. 역시 단점이라면 d5를 내주고, d6 폰이 뒤로 밀리게 됩니다.  이게 나중에 백에게 큰 역할을 하게 됩니다. 겨우 백 퀸을 a1-h8에서 쫓아냈더니 2폰이 달리기 시작... 나이트가 전진기지를 잃습니다. d4로 가겠죠? 구멍에 안착. c3를 준비하고, f5-f6로 흑 킹을 압박할 수도 있습니다. 흑이 많이 좋지가 않습니다. 캐슬을 한다 해도 방어태세가 안 되어 있으므로... 체스에서 재미있는 부분은, 어떤 시점에서는 공격을 가는게 아니라 상대가 둘만한 수를 봉쇄하는 것입니다. ...nd4!는 확실히 좋은 수죠? 백 b3 비숍이 c2로도 올 수 있게 되었습니다.  흑 나이트가 f6에 있었다면 ...bg4로 백 퀸을 노릴 수 있을 텐데... 이게 다 오프닝 탓입니다. 흑 킹을 b3 비숍으로부터 피함과 동시에 ...f5를 준비합니다. 확실히 그렇게 되면 백 폰 돌진이 막히겠죠. 그러므로... e5를 내주는 대신에 f6을 노립니다. 최선수를 서로 둔다면 백은 a1, c1의 기물과 더 나아가서 g,h폰도 쓰게 되겠죠. 흑이 공간이 좁아서 방어진을 짜기 참 힘듭니다. 방어를 위한 수인데... e7비숍이 거대한 폰이 되어버리는 눈물의 현장. 백은 말 그대로 게임이 저절로 굴러가고 있습니다.  다만 여기서 ...ne5를 조심해야 합니다. ne5-f7 등으로 방어하면 성가십니다. 그러므로... 오면 먹는다!    체스 고수가 되는 비결 중 하나는 어떤 때에 비숍을 나이트와 바꾸어야 하는지 아는 것입니다. 그 반대도요. ...dxe5가 나았을 것 같기도 합니다. 그러나 중앙의 나이트가 너무 강하군요. 그 경우 qh5를 둔 뒤에, 흑이 퀸을 바꾸자 하면 바꾸고 nc7 포크를 노리거나 d 파일을 장악하면 되겠습니다. ! - 좋은 수죠. 압박이 참... ? - 이 수는 좀 시간 낭비 같은데요.  ...bd7-e8은? h7을 노립니다.  흑 나이트가 있어야 방어가 되는데... 대체로 f6에서 견고하게 방어를 해주지만... 한 수 느립니다. 늦습니다. rxh6+으로 끝내려 하는데... 이런, 다음 수를 못 봤어요. rxh6+ bxh6으로 방어합니다. ...be8도 있으므로 빨리 행동해야겠죠? ...bg5까지 읽었다면 좀 더 완벽했을 텐데... 그래도 워낙 구조와 모양이 좋아서 즉석에서 해법이 나옵니다.  h3 룩이 비숍에게 당하지만 지금 당장 퀸+폰 조합으로 g7에 메이트가 나오므로 이걸 막아야겠죠?  ...gxf6 rxh6+ bxh6 qxh6+ kg8, ng6++#으로 메이트. 여기서 좀 생각을 하다가 이 시점에서 병력 이득을 보는게 맞다는 결론. 15분 게임입니다. ...bxf6 후 ...be7로 d6폰을 방어해야 하는데... 아이고...  이른바 x-ray가 되었습니다. 꼬치 꿰듯 둘 다 조준. 당연히 비숍을 살려야... 폰을 주더라도 백 룩이 침입하는게 중요합니다. 여기서 굉장히 생각을 많이 했습니다.  ...be3+를 허용할 것이냐...를 두고 말이죠. 결론적으로 룩을 빨리 바꾸는게 좋다고 생각했습니다. 교묘한 움직임이 필요합니다.  ...be3+ 때문에 kf2를 먼저 두면 a 폰이 달아납니다. 이제 중요한 건 흑의 마지막 발악을 막는 것이죠. f,e폰과 2비숍의 조합으로 폰 미는걸 적절하게 막아야 합니다. ...b5를 허용하면 백 비숍이 안에 갇히므로 이른바 '혈도'를 찔러줍니다. 그런데 이 수를 두기 전에도 많은 생각을 했습니다. ...bc1때문인데요, 약 36수까지 계산을 하고 둔 수입니다. 한번 제가 뭘 생각했는지 이 시점에서 알아 맞추기에 도전해보시는 것도 좋습니다. 이렇게 되면 b,c폰이 우수수 떨어져 나갈거 같은데... 위기일까요? 여기서...! 네 이게 해결수입니다. 흑이 바꾸면 룩이 되잡으면서 폰을 지키죠. 다시 한번 교묘한 수 조작이 필요합니다. 백이 그대로 잡으면 흑 킹이 되잡으면서 전진하죠. 그러므로... ! 아주 좋습니다. 이러면 백은 g4 수를 번 게 됩니다. 물론 약점이 안 되게 계산을 했지요. 폰을 노려보지만... 교묘하게 방어. 여기서 c4를 둘까 했는데 폰이 흩어지는게 싫어서 관두었습니다. 그런데 나중에 좀 고생한 걸 생각하면 그래야 했을지도... 자 이제 폰 숫자는 맞추었는데, a폰을 활동시키기 힘들어졌군요. 여기서 물론 따면 안 됩니다. 그러면 흑의 f,e 폰이 갑자기 밀고 내려오므로... 폰으로 막아주기. 자 이 시점에서 백도 해법을 찾느라 고생을 좀 합니다. 55 ke6까지 넘기시는 것도 좋습니다. 대충 여기서 백이 3분, 흑은 5분 정도 남았던가... 그렇습니다. 여기서 이제서야 백은 간단하면서도 뼈를 뚫는 듯한 해법을 찾는데... 말 그대로 뼈가 끊어지는 고통을 흑이 맛보죠. 교환 후에 킹들의 위치가 흑에게 너무나도 불리합니다. 이제 기술적으로 끝내기만 하면 됩니다. 사실 이 시점에서 기권을 하는게 예의....라고 볼 수 도 있는데 시간승을 노리는 건지... 이런 버티기는 좀 별로입니다.  이런 버티기가 싫어서 잽싸게, 그리고 안전하게 숨통을 끊는 법을 많이 연습했죠. 흑이 스테일메이트를 노립니다만 안 됩니다. 보다시피 흑 킹이 활동할 공간은 주 되, 한 줄에서만 왔다갔다하게 하면 됩니다. 체크메이트. -_-a;; 이렇게 버티는 건 좀 추잡한데 말입니다...  제 생각에, 오프닝부터 엔딩까지 상당히 논리적으로 잘 연결된 대국이었습니다. 
-------------------------------------
scotch opening (c44) här avviker svart från öppningsboken. börjar utveckla mina pjäser då. fortsätter att utveckla mina pjäser och att förbereda för rockad. precis som svart nyss gjorde  f ö. normalt spel, fast jag har större rörlighet på mina pjäser. här faller sig schackningen lämplig, bl a pg a att svarts c-bonde står ensam, och min l kan forcera framåt. alternativt parerar han med s och förlorar mark. snygg gaffel mellan hans k och t. då utväxlar vi hans t mot min l på a8. pressar uppåt och betar av hans material. dessutom är det aldrig fel med en s i mitten, men se upp för hans diagonal med d som går mot g2. en utväxling som slutar med att jag kniper hans bonde på d5. nu leder jag materiellt, men positionellt behöver jag avancera. trevligt. nu bjuder svart på en kunglig gaffel som ger mig hans d sedan och hans l först. alltid snyggt med kungsgafflar, och materiellt belönande. inte mycket och snacka om. nu är han både materiellt och positionellt försvagad, så vi kan börja klura ut mattnät. hans s ligger löst, så vi tar den först. nu har svart inte mycket kvar av sina styrkor efter denna rensopning. hans k ligger snyggt inträngd i hörnet, och hans t får det tufft att hålla stången länge till. svart ger sig en flyktväg efter att jag tagit hans t, men jag hinner upp till f5 och kontrar. nu går han med k till h7, och då återschackar jag på f5. det finns säkert snabbare mattar, men vi får se. analyserar senare. skär av svarts k samtliga flyktvägar, och tvingar honom att agera med bönderna. hotar han med f6, så går jag upp med d till f5+.  *svart gav upp ! 
-------------------------------------
qgd (d06), marshall defence här lämnar svart qgd (d06), marshall defence. qh5 hade varit i den linjen. här hade jag förvisso en gaffel med s på e5 mellan hans d och l, men jag väljer ett mer långsiktigt drag med e3. mina möjligheter att göra rockad bibehålls lättare då. svart förlorar tempo genom att göra futtiga drag i följd med sin d. förmodligen hoppas svart på en utväxling av d inom kort, men det blir endast d-förlust p g a min s parering. här missade jag s-pareringen på b5 med hans d-förlust, men det kommer nya kombinationer. finemang, gaffeln på b5 kvarstår. siktar sedan mot c7 och gafflar svarts k och t. parerar han med d på a6 så har jag l på f1 som slår hårt. slår han min bonde a2, så gafflar jag ändå på c7 och tar hans t. parerar han med qe7 så gafflar jag på c7 ändå. den utväxlingen ger mig hans d mot mitt t, om jag täcker med d på b3. trevligt. då tar vi hans d redan nu istället. en snabb blick, och jag ser en en damgaffel som dessutom involverar svarts k. taktiskt snygg. som det har utvecklat sig kan man nästan hoppa över mittspelet och gå direkt på slutspel. skit samma om hon/han slår min s på f3 och sabbar mitt försvar. eftersom jag leder så pass stort materiellt är det inte lika viktigt.  *svart gav sig här. 
-------------------------------------
french (c11), steinitz, bradford attack qb6 seems okay also. bc5 looks better in my opinion. the following line is best: … o-o 14.  h4  f5  15. exf6 e.p. rxf6 15. b4  ne4  16. nxe4 dxe4 chasing the knight away seems okay to me.  … o-o 16.  be2  rab8  17. h5 rb6 should be considered.  don't understand why the opponent would retreat with the knight from such a position. 19. f5  rb6  20. qf4 c4  21. f6 gxf6.  pushing with pawns on the king side...  f5 would also weaken the center of the board.  21. rhg1  rb6  22. g6 hxg6  23. hxg6 fxg6  24. qf3 o-o   … d4 21.  h6  fxg6 is much better. … qg5+ 23.  kb1  d4  24. f6 gxf6 wins the pawn on f5. blunder loses the rook on h1. the following is a lot better (chases the queen and pushes towards the king): 24. f6  qb7  25. rh4 rf8  26. ne2 bf3  27. rf4 bh5  28. rg1 rb6  29. fxg7 qxg7  30. rxf8+ qxf8 the rook seems likes an easy target but after the following we see it is his downfall. … bxh1 24.  f6  qc7  25. f7+ kf8  26. rxh1 qxe5  27. qh4 qe3+  28. kb1 qxe2  29. qd8# 25. f6  qc7  26. f7+ kf8 is the better solution. … o-o 26.  f6  gxf6  27. exf6 rxf6   … kd8 28.  rg2  re8 is better.  protects the king from the white queen and prevents qc8+ winning a free rook. 35. qa7+  kf8 36.  e6 qh1+  37. ka2 qd5+  38. kb1 qf5  39. qd7 qf1+  40. ka2 best: +0.01 » 30. qc7+ ke8 31. qc8+ ke7 is also a good line. … rxg6 30.  rxg6  qf1+ 31. rf1 puts more pressure against the black king. blunder.  … ke6 33.  qf7+  rxf7  34. gxf7 qd6  35. f8=q qxf8 36.  rxf8  kd5  37. rd8+ ke5  38. rg8 g5  39. rg6 c4  40. rxh6 gives white the win.  the correct move … kd8 followed by 33.  qa8+ keeps the game even.  again the following line is superior: 34. qf7+  rxf7  35. gxf7 qd6  36. f8=q qxf8  37. rxf8 ke5  38. rc8 kd5  39. ra8 g5  40. rxa4 g4  41. ra7 blunder which loses the game for black … qd6 34.  re1+  kf5  35. qe4+ kg5  36. rg1+ qg3  37. rxg3+ kh5  38. qg4# re1+ kf5  36. qe4+ kg5  37. rg1+ qg3  38. rxg3+ kh5  39. qg4#  missed checkmate in 5 moves. white wins the game with the queen promotion. 
-------------------------------------
nc6 looks natural however the best move here is bf5. i made this move here to develop my bishop and clear the back for potential castles on either side.  d5 is more aggressive (probably better as well) and keeps the pressure against the opponent. engine says bb4 is better after: … bb4 14. bg5 bxc3 15. bxf6 bxb2+ 16. kxb2 gxf6 17. d5 ne5 18. be2 rfc8 19. rhe1 bf5 20. nd4 be4 regardless white has a slight advantage.  here d6! is definitely better.  after a few exchanges white is better with this move by about 2 points. this move is not good.  the reason i did this move is to defend nc3 and attack nf6. the problem with this move is white loses a pawn: be5 bxc3 18. bxc3 nxd5 19. rhe1 f6 20. c4 fxe5 21. rxd5 bxf3 22. gxf3 here my opponent makes a big mistake because 23. bc5! 22. ... nf4 is the correct move. and of course now i make the big mistake (refer to previous note) we agree to a draw.  i do not think i could have won the battle or pawn race on the queenside. 
-------------------------------------
so my second match of the season, with black against a player with a slightly higher grading. i play a grünfeld defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence he plays the exchange variation. i take back. he claims the centre. i take. he takes back. i complete the fianchetto. he plays the old main line. an alternative, not necessarily better or worse, is the combination of be2, nf3 and rb1. i castle. the usual follow-up to bc4. white prevents the pin bc8-g4, which can now be simply met with f3, which white couldn't do if the knight went to f3. i hit his centre. the bishop needs to move to e3 to give greater support to d4, but it may have been better to play 0-0 first to avoid the simplification that now follows. i take. he takes back. this is why he maybe should have castled on move 9. queen blocks. i take. king takes back. in the endgame it is better to keep the king in the centre. attacking d4 again. preparing to tuck the king away on e1. attacking the bishop. all white's peices are developed to sensible squares. i need to cath up on development. first the bishop. on my database, there are only moves where the bishop moves back to d3.  i have to prevent his rc1 rolling into c7. discovring an attack on a7 so i stop that. white controls the centre. i need to relief my position with exchanges. i thought the best way was to exchange rooks first. so off one goes! he takes back. i contest the c file again. and the other rooks come off. i take back. this has the threat of e4-e5, cutting off my bg7. i know take the chance to swap off to an opposite coloured bishop ending, which are notoriously drawn. instead he could have given me more problems with nb5 threatening a7. if i reply a6 he has na7 and both my bc8 and b6 are hanging. however i think i can hold the draw with active defence - 20. nb5 ba6 21. nxa7 nxb3 22. axb3 bf1 23. g3 bg2 and black gets the pawn back as pawn on e4 can't be protected by the white king, without allowing a repetition - 24. kd3 24. bf1+ etc. white can still hang to the extra pawn with 24. nc8 bxe4 25. nxb6, protecting d5, but it is hard for white to convert the extra pawn, given the reduction in material. i take his knight. he takes back. i take the bishop. he takes back. i played this, and offered a draw, which he declined. it is very hard for either side to win now. so his king comes up. and so does mine. trying to push and generate a passed central pawn. attcking d5 and if he advances it, i have the pawn on g2. so he protects with his king. i check his king. he offered a draw, which i accepted. many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two, and rate the annotation on the star system, to let me know how i am doing. until next time, dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
a very aggressive opening, i was wondering what the plan was beat agression with agression ;) as i mentioned him really liking my pawns.. my opponent pointed out he also quite liked horses. luckily enough, i always enjoy those rooks! the swap.. the almighty swap!! as of this point, i started to almost dislike the game, since my chances are failing. apparently, no swaps no more! putting some pressure on the horses. freeing the rook? just to build up the heat. the bishop at c5 is covered by ne4×bc5, re8×ne2 (covered by bg4). a slightly disappointing, but very relieving end of this good and somewhat scary game.  
-------------------------------------
i have always liked this opening, i use it allot, (by the way i am black) ok whites queen has come out better bring some more pieces out to play  ok i know white trying to move my knight i don't want to allow white to do this so i move my prawn to h6 open my prawn up a bit allow my bishop to see the whites prawn ok ill have that and attack your queen!!! um mm this was a good move by white, if i move my bishop back he has the prawn on g7, and my knight on f6 is in danger i cannot let this happen!! ok queen come to help out "back up!!!!" ok i new this would happen and i let it but, better to attack now i am sick of giving away control!!! ok i gave away my bishop but i am attacking whites queen, forcing white to take my bishop and exchange queens  i am down a bishop my fault but i don't mind, because i have control, now its my turn to attack!!!! if white takes the prawn i have whites rook, "come on take it go on go on go on go on go on go on go on" well white could see the weakness in taking my prawn, as its settled down a bit time to tidy up a little.  good time to protect my king i thought “gave myself a pat on the back,”  well if you want to take my knight you will have to put your self in check, i didnt want white to take my knight ok what white had seen there was my hidden attack of moving my knight to g3 in my next move putting white in check and allowing my to capture whites rook, so good move again by white well spotted had to do this i thought if i attacked with my knight i would have allowed white to get a prawn on b7 and my rook useing the bishop on g2, i wasn't about to let that happen forced to move my knight, ok but where to move it that's the question, rem it will be check in the next move, in the end better to be safe and move him back to f6 um i didn't think white would move there, :) yep u can see it to prawn up one on d4 hahaha lets check white again, ok now i have opened white up time to attack, that rook looks nice  thanks ill have that :) white rook safe but i can see checkmate in the future, need to tempt white with bate tho just to distract there attention, so i can go for the kill, what can i use ow ya my other knight  i know that white wants my knight because if white gets it the game will be level, so lets use that but first, i want a rook, if i cannot get one ill just get the other ;) ok this took a bit of risk, rem i new white would take my knight i was counting on it, and i have hidden my true attentions, that’s checkmate, now i have the whites king where i want it yes :) never saw it coming,  i have the rook and checkmate one move  i thought white would make that move, white didnt want to lose another prawn well, you can have the prawn ill have checkmate  :) that's how you do it, just need to do that in every game lol  
-------------------------------------
i am annotated this game to ask others about the position and get feedback. the computer calls a set of moves near end of game a blunder. however, i purposely sacrificed a knight to gain a rook. please comment on this and let me know your thoughts. black resigned, so i really don't know how it would have turned out, but it didn't look good for black. i like playing against this defense. looking for a strong center game. anticipated this move and appreciate the tension. discouraging the pawn capture. touché  pinned the knight, pretty standard so far i prefer playing be2 here as black. otherwise, my king pawns get skewed and reduces the effectivity of a king side castle first blood! i don't mind the exchange and his only option is to double the pawns kingside. notice black still has no minor pieces developed. was hoping to draw his queen out, but either wanted to open up the center. capture back i did think it was premature to bring the queen out, but i was eyeing the b7 pawn. mistake on blacks part. i think maybe he thought i would take and give him the center, but that would never happen. things are setting nicely. i just need to coax his bishop out of position. he moves to take his pawn out of harms way, but the cell he exited is still my knights target. hoping he brings his bishop out. abracadabra! ok, so i have his rook now and thinking this was pretty good. however, commuter analysis calls this move a blunder. why? really should have moved the king, but i don't think he sees the rook threat. black resigns here. 
-------------------------------------
the sicilian najdorf.  literally the most common opening in the world. alternatively 9. nb3. poisoned pawn variation, accepted.  the idea so far is for white to crash through the center with either f5 or e5.  in late years, the f5 line has been shown to be drawish (basically analyzed the entire game down to a draw; i.e. vallejo pons–kasparov, moscow 2004).  e5 is the only way for white to play to a win in this sicilian line. alternatively 13. rb3. the game is all book, up until this point.  black has a significant material advantage in exchange for every white piece being developed. 15... f5?  this move forces black to give up his advantages.  [16. nxe6 bb4+ 17. c3 fxe4 18. nxg7+ kf8 19. o-o+ kxg7 =]  not the immediate [16... fxe4 17. nxg7+ kf7 (the alternative leads to a mate in 5) 18. bh5+ kxg7 19. bh6+ kf6 20. o-o+ ke6 21. bg5] and mate is unavoidable. 16. bh5+??  this move is just dumb.  when i was playing, i saw an illusion of some sort, but there's really no excuse to blunder a piece for nothing. i had actually looked at nxe6 on my 16th move, but was for some reason i was convinced bh5+ was better.  at this point in the game, nxe6 is desperation play.  o-o is more solid, but black can force off several exchanges of pieces, while keeping his large material advantage. we can see white is looking pretty screwed, now that black has the tempo. a passive move in an incredibly complex situation.  black is trying to cover the c7 square which is a vulnerability in some lines.  he also wants to use his queen in a more offensive, rather than defensive manner.  the proper response is to take aggression immediately with [19... qb5 20. kf2 rf8+]. my opponent had this sequence of moves in mind, which is probably another reason why he played 19... ba5.  at first glance, it looks like white is helpless, but i read much further than my opponent in this line. exploiting the vulnerability at g7 that was present in earlier lines. 23... kxg7 24. bh6+ kg8 25. be6# kg8 prevents immediate mate. my opponent resigned. this is honestly one of the coolest mate positions i have ever seen, let alone played.  material-wise, i am down a rook+knight+pawn, yet the black king is checkmated in the center of the board.

redfoxrising: we are seeking club input (discussion) of potential moves.   so it is now my turn in this unrated game, i will take my time to move to allow for club discussion.   i'll add in some candidate moves, we are not concerned about open discussion and there is no need to make this a club consultation match with white and black teams. please feel free to openly discuss potential moves for both white played by redfoxrising and brigadecommander who is playing black. 2.bg5 is my attacking plan since her king is exposed! my battery is at 4% so i am going to shut down for now look forward to all suggestions!  nambam: if i was playing white i would play2.bf4 developing the dsb,them open up the other bishop with 3.e3  archduke_piccolo: my favourite is the standard... 2.g3.   but i have no objection to 2.bg5, 2.bf4, 2.c4 or 2.nf3.  if we want to go down the wild and woolly 2.e4 (staunton gambit) track, i don't mind. redfoxrising: i also like the 2.g3 move and the reason is to open up the lsb and gain control of the long diagonal.  jkarp: my vote is also 2.g3 for the reason that ion mentioned. for me, though, what i particularly enjoy is the fact that we're fianchettoing.      brigadecommander: i agree the 2.g3 variation is very strong for white..it is more of a positional move then an aggressive move. i play it as white against all 1.d4 openings.i will respond latter tonight.it is 7;40 am here right now.  redfoxrising: expected this move anyone feel free for suggestions comments  archduke_piccolo: popular... ... and good, here, is 3.bg2.   having played the g-pawn forward to accommodate the bishop, we might as well play it now, and keep our options open in respect of the knights. we establish an immediate presence on the central light squares, which might be worth something if we later place a knight on c3 or a queen on b3.   there is an alternative that might be worth looking at, and i wouldn't say 'no' to: 3.nh3. i've not played it before; it is a bit unusual, but develops a knight whilst at the same time keeping the light long diagonal uninterrupted. against that, though, is that as we would be likely to play bg2 the move following, and there seems to be nothing against following with 4.nh3 if we chose, there seems to be no compelling reason to move the knight just yet.   also playable are 3.nf3 - straightforward development - and 3.bg5. also possible is 3.c4. that move i have played (by transposition) against strong opposition, for a draw.  brigadecommander: i am relieved that  you guys are not playing the staunton gambit!! as hinted at by the arch duke.  redfoxrising: i also see no reason not to play 3. bg2 as that was the plan, and then we can start more development of our minor pieces. the staunton gambit is something that i want to play someday.  black to move..  the-sigularity:3.e6 opens diagonal for dsb and good for early castle     brigadecommander: depending on whites plan,i intend a dutch stonewall.  archduke_piccolo:  i knew it! black intends a stonewall. i seem to recall that it is a bit of a favourite with janet, and i quite like that defence myself. i near as a toucher mentioned the possibility in an earlier posting, but figured that might not so smart a thing to do. the stonewall is named for the strong maginot line of pawns across the central 4 files. but it masks an aggressive intent - more reminiscent of the sobriquet of a certain confederate general officer...   three options suggest themselves, here: 4.c4, 4.nf3, 4.nh3  i'd probably go for the first of these, staking out a share of the centre, but nf3 does immediately poke at the major weakness in black's planned opening: e5.   developing the knight at h3 is a far-seeing move, one of whose motivations is to manouevre via f4 to c3, aiming for e5. the other knight would be developed via d2 to f3. the other motivation is an eventual f-pawn advance to f4, to establish a firm control of e5.   having said that, the move can wait a move or two (but of course, if nf3, is no longer an option). refoxrising: on my phone archduke thanks for the in-depth analysis. 4 c4 will be my move i will wait and see her move i think she develop her b  in any case i plan nf3 as suggested  redfoxrising: i'm considering 5.qb3 to protect a b check! i encourage anyone to suggest another move but for now i will wait for some input of the other moves you think are better! even bc might add a comment you never know  just a reminder this is a unrated game and its getting interesting nambam:i would still play bg5.better late than never,and follow with nb3. it is imperative against this line to get both bishops into the contest as early as possible and to exert pressure on e5 archduke_piccolo:  white's 5th move... plenty of choice here.   one might try 5.qb3, to steer the game into uncharted territory, but i think there are better options. i would not worry overmuch about ...bb4ch, as we can always interpose a bishop and 'ask' (as it were) black if she really wants to part with her 'good' bishop.   if we want to move our queen, then what about 5.qc2, instead? the move covers c4 against capture (unlikely, but possible), but also establishes a presence on the c-file should we decide at some point to take on d5.   alternatively, we can develop one of the knights. my preference is to finish developing on the k-side - so 5.nf3 and 5.nh3.   5,nf3 looks 'natural', aiming immediately at the 'hole' on e5. we can then castle, and set about mobilising the other wing. the drawback to this is difficulty in bringing the other knight into effective action. that we would have to think about. having said that, the move is quite sound and solid.   5.nh3, on the other hand, looks artificial, in complete defiance of the usual guidelines in respect of the centre. but the intent is to bring this knight fairly shortly via f4 to d3; and the queen's knight develops via d2 to f3. both would then be focusing upon the e5-square. quite in keeping with the centralising principle. i like this idea, and it is unclear - given that it involves four further knight moves - whether black has the means to prevent it.   as it happens, in the sequence of knight manouevres, it is likely we would want to play qc2 anyway. if i were voting i would probably opt for one of these two moves: 5.qc2 or 5.nh3. for mine, a 50-50 call.  redfoxrising: it was either this move 5. nh3or qc2  i chose this for development reafons, but also believe qc2  also we can castle or play other developing moves.  we are working hard against the stonewall and i feel we can play  our game with each move to penetrate the generals wall  defence.   redfoxrising:move 6 suggestions 6.qc2 was on the discussion so that is the question? are we ready for this q move or do we have some other suggestions? off to work i'll check back in later   redfoxrising: move 6 0-0 decided to move 6. 0-0 had thought it over today and feel it is better than qc2 black to move archduke_piccolo: sorry... ... didn't get back to this in time. quite happy with 6.0-0, but would also have been ok with 6.qc2, or 6.nd2. all are thematic.      brigadecommander: white has a workable advantage.i knew that going into this variation. black pins her hopes on the middle-game. and on building 'interior lines of comunications'.  archduke_piccolo: whoa... i was about to suggest 7.nd2 or 7.qc2, but suddenly they don't look so attractive. why? my concern is with the possible reply 7...ne4, after which our plan of establishing our own knights on f3 and d3 don't look so realisable. e.g. 7.nd2 ne4 8.nf3? g5 ... and we are in 'uh, oh' country. we could delay the knight moves by 8.qc2, but i think we might fetch up looking for another plan.   the alternative plan might involve f2-f4 and/or b2-b3, to bring our light-square bishop to a more useful diagonal.   the moves nd2 or qc2 won't hurt us, exactly, but it might be worthwhile looking around for alternatives, or else a plan that will 'go' with these moves. for instance, we might play 7.qc2 ne4 8.f3 driving back the knight. the drawback is that f3 would no longer be available to the c2-knight.   big think time methinks...  jkarp: what about something like 7.bg5 in a position like this, where janet's nf6, be7, and q on the same diagonal, i'd be tempted to try and put pressure on her. question is how effective is this given her strength? against your average player, so in 1 or 2 otb tournament games, it was quite effective. and, that was, before i started notating them. nambam: i think our lsb is misplaced personally, should be on e2 in my opinion. it is a bit late now to further develop the dsb. i would now go ahead with nd2 or perhaps pxp first. we are playing janet's game at the moment archduke_piccolo: bg2. i'm not at all fazed by the location of our dsb. it's fine where it is.   my thoughts are now on qc2, nd2 or b3. at the moment i think i would go with any of these three. of the last of these my one caveat is: what does it do for us? relocate the bishop to a better diagonal, or is it simply a better guard over c4 (which, after all, isn't guarded at all right now)? maybe both?   note that, after 7.nd2 ne4 we really don't want to exchange knights on e4. further, we will probably want to play 8.qc2, to ensure c4 is adequately protected. as it turns out, after 7.qc2 ne4, we'd likely want to play 8.nd2. so, in effect, the first two moves of the trio amount pretty much to the same thing. nor do they rule out b2-b3 shortly thereafter.   so i reckon i'll be happy enough with nd2 or qc2. i won't be hugely sorry, though, if the preference fell on b3.  redfoxrising: still time left to decide i think the best moves are nd2,qc2, and b3  so my decision is to choose 1 of the 3 and and the move order is pretty much interchangeable   i'm going to keep on thinking a little bit in case someone else wishes to add to the discussion.    brigadecommander: the frontier fortifications are complete. depending on what white does, black now has the task of organizing her interior lines behind her central bulwark. redfoxrising: some moves we have discussed including 8. nd2,qc2 of those i favor nd2   for new moves in no particular order 8.e3, nc3 of these i favor nc3  a new move fianchetto 8.bb2   so to narrow down 8. bb2 or nd2 i'm leaning towards 8. bb2 as the best of these moves.    nd2,bb2,nc3,e3;qc2 are the choices please make your selection for move 8. from these or possibly a better suggested move. archduke_piccolo: now that we have advanced the b-pawn, we might as well fianchetto the bishop. but here's a thing: how about inviting black to exchange off her dark-square bishop by playing 8.ba3? that will leave black's centre a trifle weak on the dark squares. it won't be easy to exploit, of course, without our own dsb, but sure bears thinking about.   alternatives seem to be 8.bb2 and 8.nd2. on the whole i prefer the bishop face-off: 8.ba3.  nambam: obviously nxb redfoxrising: discussion of our move 10. n on a3 is now attacked. nc2 or nb1. qc1 protects the n.   any suggestions?  brigadecommander: white has some advantage.  redfoxrising: looking at 11.rc1 ?not sure what she may play here  12.cxd5 cxd5 13.qd2  but my plan is to get rook to the center on the c-file and get q moved up to connect our rooks  any suggestions?  redfoxrising: 12. cxdx 12.ne3 12.nf4 12.qd2 or another suggested move?   those are my suggestions thus far, i have some other active games then i will come back to this game as it has the most time. of the 4 moves i seem to now like 12. nf4 but am open to suggestions as at one time i thought i ranked them in my preference of move order, just goes to show you need to look for your best move. we have time, but i tend to want to move too fast, enjoy the long days of summer but please do consider making your choices known as i would hate to make my next moves with out your participation.  12.nf4 bb7 13.cxd5 cxd5  move order could be … as nf4 is a better square for our n getting it off the rim and bb7 gets her b activated. then taking cxd5 or be taken by her sooner dxc7.  we also need to look at her last move of b6 it is a development move that allows her dsb to get in the game.  this is a very challenging game playing her with such a higher rating. but being a unrated game does allow us to play her with potentially club members times x : against just her! so lets keep our advantages as just 1 wrong move we can easily lose it, i'd much more want to keep our slight advantage over her while we can.   brigadecommander: a unrated game allows me the luxury of experimenting with certain openings. taking more risks etc. the dutch defense has long interested me. i believe it has great potential for improvement. so i learn also from these games. so far you guys have played an excellent game.... archduke_piccolo: sorry - - this fell off the radar for a while. this won't be the last time that happens.   i'm good with 12.nf4 , the likely continuation being 12...g5 13.nd3 bb7, at which point we can decide between 14.ne3, 14.ne1 or some other option.   a reasonable alternative to nf4 might be 12.ne3, but i'm not really sure where that might lead us.  brigadecommander: arch duke, i am officially calling my position 'helms deep'  jkarp: i'm thinking now of something like 14.qd2 to connect the r's, but also there's tension, even when janet protects g5. redfoxrising: thanks joe 14. qd2 has been a suggested move by jkarp  anyone else have a suggestion? how about 14. ne3 she might play ne4? or rac8 then we can play 15. qc2...ne4? move order not sure of?  archduke_piccolo:i'm going to suggest... 14.ne1.  whether it is any better than ne3, or even as good, i don't know, but it seems to me a 'natural' sort of move, with 15.nf3 in mind.  redfoxrising: both n's can be moved to e1 ion i'm thinking nce1 is best is this the n you suggested?  what do you think joe? ion posted ne1 and you tend to be interested in his suggestions. if you read this first please let us know which n move and why. i did bot choose nd because it is more centrally located and thus i believe in a better position. i did make the suggestion prior for ne3 which may not be better than ne1   anyone else care to participate in this discussion? jkarp: i agree with you ron and think that 14.nce1 is better then 14.nde1 for the reason that you mentioned. so, 14.nce1 is my vote. in addition, we can move it to a better spot, whereas, our nd3 is better placed.   archduke_piccolo: you are right... ... i meant 14.nce1. i was so fixated on the 'either/or' that i didn't notice the other knight could so move. mind you, i wasn't really expecting much agreement, neither! the idea is nf3 then (maybe) nfe5. it is possible black might cut across this by 14...g4, against which i would consider 15.f4.  brigadecommander: white has the advantage. archduke_piccolo: ok... i thought i had endorsed 15.nef3. maybe (as i often do) forgot to 'post now'.  redfoxrising: ok thought so too! thanks archduke!   here comes the fighting uruk-hai!  brigadecommander: better ask saruman to conjure up some explosives if you want to breech my walls!!.   ''"look to my coming, at first light, on the fifth day. at dawn, look to the east." g  redfoxrising:thinking 16. ne5 but which n? any suggestion? expect nxn then retake nxn. so does it matter? i'm asking this for participation reasons as i do appreciate input in this game.   is there a better move? another plan? i'm sure there is and i have been looking at many moves since she moved..   we have time, time is running out, anyone care to make a suggestion? if not. i'll be moving soon. get your suggestions in    brigadecommander: red that's the best move you had.white still has advantage.  archduke_piccolo: i keep missing these... ... having all sorts of other places to visit...   i would have chosen the f-knight to go to e5, sure.  redfoxrising: thanks archduke games still active i'm thinking i need to get the queen in the game   anyone else care to express a comment?  brigadecommander: oops made a bad error.  archduke_piccolo: the obvious move... ... seems to be the best way to exploit janet's wee slip: 18.ng6. redfoxrising: yes indeed, anyone else ?? i would play this in hopes of the fork, against lower rated players.  i could not spell out this here in our discussion, would of done by pm, but i never expected her slip. i looked at other moves that would of stopped the fork plan from happening. i know jkarp is behind what ever you suggest... haven't heard any others comments in this team game from anyone else.  thanks for your suggestion ion it does seem to be the best suggested move.  brigadecommander: i make mistakes like every one else. i planned 17...rd8 followed by nd7. i inverted the order.if you guys pool your resources you have a won game.but i will still fight on.  redfoxrising: nxf8 complete the attack after the fork too bad it wasn't a check fork, i thought it was then just realized it wasn't  redfoxrising: things went fast it's our turn now! so time to discuss move 20. many moves to choose from...   pawn moves like e3 are compound move as it opens the white diagonal for the q   qc2 or qd3 does 2 things develops a major piece and connects the rooks   there are other move considerations, please let us know what you want to suggest.   i make a move soon or could allow some others to get online and give us a suggestion.  archduke_piccolo: i must admit... ... i'm tempted by 20.c5, here. the main line seems to run   20.c5 bxc5  21.dxc5 nxc5  22.qd4 ne4  23.bxe4!? fxe4  24.qxa7 ...  i have to admit i would be somewhat concerned about that central black pawn phalanx, and the weaked light squares on the k-side, but against that, black is left with a 'bad' bishop, and white still has the exchange and a remote passer on the q-side.   whether this is any good, or white has anything better, have yet to be determined. redfoxrising: i like c5 and i will play c5 i plan to follow what ion has predicted   archduke_piccolo: uh... i would have gone along with 20...qd2...     but i still think 20.c5 is ok.  archduke_piccolo:next move is a gimme... no alternative but 21.dxc5, and after 21...nxc5, 22.qd4.    redfoxrising: if looking to connect our rooks qd2 or qc2 . other moves to consider are f4 and re1.  i'm looking for discussion. hope everyone had a good week-end!  we have a nice advantage here in this game and now need to double-check our moves and be sure to find the best possible moves. archduke_piccolo: once again... probably just as well. i was thinking of 22.b4, but maybe 22.qd2 is a better option.  redfoxrising: i was thinking... i looked at almost every possible move and b4 has my approval and i'm sure jkarp would like it also. that's my move 22. b4 protecting our passed pawn drat... ... i came here with another idea: 22.f4. never mind.   i did consider 23.b5 in response to black's move 22, but have decided the combination that follows is a losing proposition. instead, i'll go for the 'natural' 23.a3.  jkarp: this is really, as gm susan polgar puts it on, "what does my opponent want?" well, in this case, janet wants us to move our q in a place where it doesn't protect e2 so that she can get a pawn. as such, i think that 24.bf3 is our best move and gets my vote to give it extra protection, as that will enable us to move our q on the next move. my real goal, in this position, would be to attack a5 which just isn't possible, yet.  redfoxrising: good observation jkarp i was looking at f4 i do however like your suggestion of 24.bf3  i hope ion can give us his suggestions...  i lost my previous notes that i thought i post just prior to your suggestion.  q development was some of my ideas  posting know from my cell phone for now!  archduke_piccolo: if ... 24.bf3, i'd be concerned about 24...g5, which would force the bishop back to g2. it will probably be best to leave our bishop where it is.   my list of candidate moves here would be.   24.qd2  24.f4  24.re1  24.qa4  the last of these is a bit of an outlier, but it does not look as though the enemy bishop can't take ...bxe2, on account of 25.re1 bc4 26.rxe6. on the other hand 24...bb5 looks an effective reply.   probably i would choose between qd2 and f4. haven't yet made up my mind.  nambam: i lost track a bit because of hospital visit, bur am o.k. now. i think queen move is the go,as along with joe i want to keep an eye on e2 . i think think qd2 will be best,and see what eventuates. so.22 qd2 is my vote  redfoxrising:  i also think 24.qd2 is a good move  anyone else? we still have time  brigadecommander: archd; i think you had better ask saruman for some explosives!!  redfoxrising: 25. re1 or f4 or f3  some possible moves 25. re1 or f4 or f3  any others?  archduke_piccolo: any of those moves ... ... seems reasonable.   i quite like 25.f4.   i did consider 25.h4, as well, which leads to fun and games after 25...f4. but on the whole i don't think we get enough. janet has hinted that she has compensation for the material deficit. i think she's probably at least partly right.  redfoxrising: our turn to move how about 26. rf2 or qe3  or:  26.h4 e.p. pxh3 27. bxh4   26. h3 h5   then 27. h4   here wall does need something to get thru it!   any suggestions?  archduke_piccolo: janet... is playing for the draw, and hopes to place a bind right across the board. i admit that i didn't expect ...g4, on the grounds that it does offer us a lever to open the h-file on that flank. what i'm thinking now is to keep that lever in mind but for now, see what the prospects are for breaking open the centre.   were we to play 26.h3 h5 then i suggest 27.hxg4. i would not play 26.h4, as that would lock up the k-side. she wouldn't even bother playing ...h5-h4, preferring to keep that move in hand for a 'waiting' move (or, as i call it, a 'lever').   26.rf2 has its points, as does 26.kf2. but maybe would could look at rfe1 or rfd1, freeing the e-pawn. we should also be on the lookout for chances favourably to offer the exchange back.   not an easy position to play, this.  redfoxrising: avoiding a draw 26. rfe1 loading our torpedo!!! avoiding a draw!!!  brigadecommander: the wall is getting stronger.torpedoes will not avail you now. you can still prevail but, you need an armored division at the least. bc  nambam: this wall is going to take some breaking down alright. i think we could continue to probe for now. either rb1 or perhaps qd4 and give janet a chance to provide a chink? 27.rb1 is my vote  redfoxrising: move 27  rb1. qd4 any other suggestions?  both move are good how ever i do like qd4 and 2nd is rb1   anyone else wish to contribute?  archduke_piccolo:let's try... 27.qb2, getting the q onto the long diagonal, and eyeing the b-file for the time being. i think the qb2 positioning is a bit more flexible than the qd4.   i admit to being very tempted by 27.e4, but it seems to be good only for a draw, if that. i'd also like to try the h3 break some time, but that should wait until the moment is the most propitious.   meanwhile, i think janet's appraisal is about right: if white is to win this, it will take patience and alertness, and is likely to require a sacrificial attack to bust through that line of pawns. i thought of exchanging bishops (e3, followed by bf1) but in the resulting position, the knight is as good as a rook. so i'd probably prefer to give up the bishop for the knight.   nambam: i would continue to probe 28. qd4. redfoxrising: move 28 any more suggestions  qd2 is on the long diagonal from move 27. qb2 nambam suggested qd4 again for 28  i think a pawn move or a rook move is better or b back to our base line.    trying to break the wall, need some more suggestions move 28. not easy to choose h3,e3, bf1,kf2,red1,rcd1. qd4 nambam  archduke_piccolo: difficult... i played through a conjectural line beginning qe5 that went down to a rook and 5 vs bishop and 6. the ending position left nowhere where the the white king could invade or break through. i'm beginning to suspect a win is now unlikely. i'm tempted to play h3, but i don't think that leads anywhere unless we can get leverage elsewhere. that 'elsewhere has to be the centre, and we don't have anything there at the moment.   i think i'd try rcd1, but i'm not optimistic. nambam: rcd1 is one of my suggested waiting moves,so i vote rcd1  archduke_piccolo: i'm looking... ... at 29.qe5, here. looking at the possibility a move or so back, it didn't look so attractive, but with both rooks on the centre files, it doesn't look so bad at all.   further investigation needed, of course - let's not be too hasty. other ideas are:   29.qd4  29.h3  29.h4 (= in my view)  29.e4 another move i've been eyeing for a while, but not clear that it gives us anything.  29.e3 possibly with the view to exchanging off bishops - can't say this floats my boat, neither. the relevance to our position... ... appears to be the potential breaks at b5 and h3. black has a potential break at b4. by sacrificing a knight there, she might create a passed pawn.   she might also have in mind the kind of switching attention from wing to wing, though in the problem, that is forced upon white, whose path to the ideal squares is a long and narrow one.   what i have been looking at are potential breaks for white in the centre, focusing on what e2-e4 might achieve. in the circumstances, that doesn't look easy to arrange, given black's coverage of that square. and that is why qe5 has drawn my attention over the last couple of moves or so. at first it looked unpromising, but i'm coming round to thinking that maybe that is where our best chance lies.   so, my vote is for 29.qe5.   but i'm not going to complain if the vote comes down to a different choice, and am willing to be persuaded that a better option exists. nambam: after playing through what i think are all possible moves to break the deadlock, i conclude that i agree with the duke in that our best chance lies with 29. qe5. it then depends on whether janet wants to swap queens or not. i have played out both scenarios to some lengths,and believe that both give us chances,but will wait to see which way the cat jumps before going into more detail.  redfoxrising: thanks duke and morgan i also have been looking at this same move...    brigadecommander: i think i would have played e3 as white. the only plausible breakthrough point was b5. exchanging bishops would have facilitated that. imho however some interesting,combinative, and aggressive lines of attack, are now open to white. black is by no-means out of the woods.now the blood will be spilled. who's blood? that remains to be seen.  brigadecommander: red i played nd7 after pxq, with a conditional move. redfoxrising: after 30. pxq conditional move by black 30. nd7 i'm considering 31. e4 fxe4 now the wall will fall! archduke_piccolo: i looked at the bishop exchange... ... it was kinda obvious, but it seemed to me would not have got us anywhere. sure, we had the twin 'breaks' at b5 and h3 (as i mentioned earlier), but they would have been easily contained, in my view. so, having examined the e3, be1, exchange bishops sequence, i was inclined to discard it. perhaps i ought to have mentioned it.   having said that, that was merely my opinion. if, having discussed the matter, the others taken the opposing view, i would have gone along with it. after all, it could scarcely have lost us the game.   as it happens, i am pleased janet accepted the exchange of queens. i was more than half expecting her to decline. the reasons will emerge, i think, over the next few moves.   at this point, i quite like 31.e4, as redfox recommends.  nambam: i agree. i am somewhat surprised janet exchanged. now that she has i think e4 is the obvious move.  brigadecommander: i anticipate and welcome e4. i took it into my calculations when you played 29.e5. i would advise you look deeper. i go on record as saying 29.e3 was the way to a win.  redfoxrising: i still believe we will get our win in time one of us will post the current board and then we will start looking for our next move...  redfoxrising: 31. e4 played noted by janet e3 would win.  seems only fair to play e4 thus it was played.  redfoxrising: it's our turn now any suggestions ??? white to discuss our next move...  archduke_piccolo: yes. i have a suggestion. how about having a good hard look at   32.rxe4.  the idea is 32...dxe4 33.rxd7ch ke8 34.rd6.    redfoxrising: i have looked at this same thing 32.rxe4 and see what she does... that's the best   redfoxrising: our turn to move 33. choices i see in no particular order for 33.  the plan duke & i thought would happen was not what i set for conditional moves...   bf1, h3, h4, rf4+ are my first thoughts for move 33. i even have a couple more, but believe one of these is best,    please post your suggestions.. brigadecommander: war i had no intention of opening up the center.my left flank is now open but...in tactical military terms i will 'refuse my flank'. the duke will know what i mean. i hate war. but this is chess.and military tactics work. here is a example of 'refusing ones flank' nambam: 33. bf1 is the best try i think, but i am not too confident. i dont think h3 will work and anything else is irrelevant or could lose redfoxrising: thanks nambam morgan has suggested bf1 it's still early and we have to here from duke or jk or anyone else who might want to get involved. if bf1 is played what might be her reaction?   rd2 was a move i left out with intention of getting to rf2+   bf1 first ,she's not opening the center and taking our r on e4 but if we play bf1 it would be hanging ? so move order seems something we need to discuss    so now that i look at this closer maybe rd2 might be our best move. what do you think?    i'm not making our next move that until i get confirmation from more than one adviser. jkarp: i also want ion's opinion, and i gather that he likes war. of course, i don't compare chess to war as others do. instead, i compare it to yoga, so keeping the breathes involved compared with our r being attacked, i'd try to settle it with 33.rf1, and after black gets out, i'd go ahead with 34.rf4 as my idea would be to simply double up on one file and try to create problems for black. in an easier position, but still complicated, i excercised the same idea when under pressure. and, i was able to win, fairly quick by doubling up like that. archduke_piccolo: i've looked at... ...  33.rf4ch and  33.bf1.  they pretty much transpose into the same thing:   33.rf4ch ke7  34.bf1 bxf1  35.rxf1 nxe5  36.kg2 ...  with the idea 37.h3.   33.bf1 bxf1ch  34.rf1ch ke7  35.rf4 ... etc.   to be honest, i don't think any other move comes into consideration, here.   redfoxrising: thank you everyone 33.rf4+ played i took a break to allow for discussion...  thank you to everyone who gave input on move 33. rf4+ was ultimately chosen   redfoxrising: while we wait for black to move we can start to discuss our next moves... archduke_piccolo: h'mmm... .... this one got away from me a bit. last i looked was back at my lasy posting here. i think i would have played kg2 ahead of h3, but i don't think it makes much difference, as h3 was the plan anyhow. redfoxrising: duke i made the moves following what you posted...  33.rf4ch ke7  34.bf1 bxf1  35.rxf1 nxe5  36.kg2 ...  with the idea 37.h3.    and now waiting for black to move feel we are in good shape to counter anything she plays   so anyone else have ideas you can post them before or after she plays   nambam: well, i dont know what you pair think, but kxp on the way to who knows what looks best we can do to me redfoxrising: suggestions kxp  seems like the best move as it takes out the passed pawn  another plan i like is rh4.  she has more pawns than us and her other minor pieces are her r and b, thinking she may go for our pawn on a3, we don't need to take with our r after 38.rh4 nc4 39.rf1f3 to protect pa3   there is joe and ion who may see something so i will leave this open for further suggestions.   redfoxrising: any suggestions rh4 rh8  rfe1 nc4   looking for best suggested moves  archduke_piccolo: two possibilities... ... spring to mind.   [a] 40.rb1  [b] 40.b5   it is my belief that we are looking at a draw, here. we just can't quite make our aggressive posture a really threatening one. meanwhile, black had strategic threats of her own. i'd probably go for option [b] as it does open a certain tactical possibility that could end the game with a flourish. redfoxrising: how about rh1?  looked at both and rh1 nambam: i agree with the archduke in that i think a draw will result if we do not make an aggressive move/ the way we have played. i believe we needed ro force an exchange of one of our rooks for the enemy nite to break open the centre to get behind the enemy lines with the other rook, and advancee our own freed centre , but the best chance of a win the way se played the opening ithink is go with rhi, see what janet replies then, if possible follow with b5. highly risky, but why not a dukelly flourish? archduke_piccolo: @nambam... yes, good. let's add 40.rh1 to our range of options. i still prefer 40.b5, but there's very little in it and prepared to go along with another option. nambam: the only reason i prefer the rook first is it gives janet one more chance to make a slight error.    brigadecommander: critical mass this ending is at a crucial point. one misstep and white will loose.i will take a few days to map it out. good luck guys. redfoxrising: sounds good! we will again get back to discussing back to discussing we are now waiting for her next move... brigadecommander: correction. i wrongly said 'one misstep and white could loose'. i meant to say 'one misstep and black looses''   redfoxrising: thats a relief you had me looking for my bad move our turn to move some thoughts now that she played 46. kd4   a. 47.a4 ke4 (a4 to keep our a pawn for now),   b. 47.a4 h4 (king is pinned can't take with g pawn)   c. 47.a4 nxa3 (sac her n for the pawn, then 48. rxa3)   d. 47.a4 ne3+ 48. kh3    48.a5 d4   a.49.ra1 h4   b.49 kg3 breaking the pin  redfoxrising: re-thinking move 48 rh8  or  a5  or??? nambam: i would say a5 for certainwere i not worried about 48....ne3ch.  redfoxrising: thanks morgan i agree with 48. a5  i am close to making that move!  red  brigadecommander: interesting endgame redfoxrising:looking for input can we draw or even bettery?  how about rh1  concerned about her active k  any suggestions   jkarp: it looks like we're in a lot of trouble. so, i'd be trying to figure out what to do with how dangerous janet's passed pawn is. in this position, i would answer by attacking the n with 50.rc8 and after the n retreats, then i'd play 51.ra2 to stop the passed pawn from advancing any further. brigadecommander: you are not in a lot of trouble.with careful play it is a draw.  archduke_piccolo:  i reckon... ... we can hold. we might even have a slight edge.   i suggest just keep pushing our passer:   50.a6 d2  51.rd8 ...   analysis of 51.a7:  at this point we probably could play 51.a7 instead, but then we would probably have to fight for the draw: 51.a7 ra5! 52.rxa5 d1=q at this point black is threatening checkmate by 53...ne3ch 54.kh2 ng4ch 55.kg2 qe2ch etc. 53.rf8 stops the mate by covering f2, but black at keeps alive an attack with the same kind of sequence. however, after 53.rg8, ne3ch 54.kh2 ng4ch?? 55.rxg4 ... white wins. nor will black play 53...na5 as 54.a8=q preserves for white some winning chances. so...   53...nb6  54.a8=q nxa8  55.rgxa8 ...  should give us a tenable end game. as a matter of interest, if we were to trade off one of our rooks for black's two pawns, and bring our remaining rook to f2, assuming the bk stays where it is, we should have a 'book' draw.  8  in the diagrammed position, even though white is in check, after kg1 the game is drawn. white's set-up is called a 'fortress' and black hasn't the resources to break it down, provided white is careful.   so 51.a7 would be playable. 51...ne3ch  52.kh3 rd5  53.rxd5 nxd5 (not 53...exd5?? and white wins after 54.a7.)  54.a7 nc7 or nb6  at this point i think i would aim directly for the draw:   55.g4 hxg4  56.kxg4 ke3  57.rd1 ...  no pussyfooting around!   57...ke2  58.ra1 ... (actually, 58.rxd2ch will do: black can't stop the wk reaching e5)  58... d1=qch  59.rxd1 kxd1  60.kf4 ...  61.ke5 ...  62.a8=q ...  63.kxe6 ...  dead game: insufficient material. nambam: i cannot make any sense ot of what is the real position. assumig it is whites move 50 i would play pa6. redfoxrising: we will play on starting pa6 and go for our draw as shown by ion's analysis.   nambam: i think black will check with the nite,but i think a draw is inevitable  archduke_piccolo: obviously ... ... we continue with 55.kxg4...  archduke_piccolo: i suggest now... 56.a7, with the idea -   56...nc7 or ...nb6  57.rd1 ke2  58.kf4.  this is the moment that led to the annotation.  redfoxrising: annotation just thinking...… jkarp will you annotate this game? nambam: i reckon alpha zero couldn't get better than a draw out of that. brigadecommander:nambam who or what is alpha zero??.i made a very bad error on move 17. i should have lost.....i barely survived against a very strong white advantage. archduke_piccolo:  not so sure ... ... about the 'very strong white advantage'. that knight quickly took up a position that made it the near-equal of a rook. after maybe two moves i was already figuring that the win, if possible, was no 'gimme'. i might have a bit of a look at it later on... archduke_piccolo: at this point... i recommend 59.kf4. when material down in a dead drawn position, it is my custom to await my opponent's draw offer. redfoxrising: i accepted the draw from bc i would have taken the promoted q with our r and then gone to the center with our k to nab her last pawn 
-------------------------------------
 une partie en mode coaching.  envoyez-moi vos commentaires, améliorations. the very popular sicilian opening.
-------------------------------------
 l'ouverture sicilienne, la plus jouée en réponse à e4. the most popular reply. white will attempt the push d4 without having to recapture with the queen.
-------------------------------------
 le coup le plus souvent joué également. les blancs vont essayer de pousser le pion d sans être obligé de reprendre avec la dame. the most popular reply. the bishop at c1 is freed.
-------------------------------------
 le coup le plus souvent joué aussi.  les noirs dégagent leur fou c. the recommended move.
-------------------------------------
 là aussi, pratiquement le seul coup recommandé. this is unusual. cxd is the best move. this creates a weakness on the white squares.
-------------------------------------
 ceci est inhabituel. il aurait été bien de jouer cxd (c'est pratiquement le seul coup recommandé). le coup joué crée une faiblesse des cases blanches. an attempt to close the center. i felt a more positional game would be more helpful in a coaching game. 
-------------------------------------
 je décide de fermer le centre. comme c'est une partie en mode coaching, je préfère amener la partie vers une position plus calme: il y a probablement plus à retirer du coaching dans ce genre de partie. black seems to agree to a calm voyage. 
-------------------------------------
 les derniers coups des deux côtés appellent peu de commentaires, sinon qu'ils respectent les deux grands principes des ouvertures (surtout sur mer calme) : mettre le peureux de roi en sécurité et sortir les pièces mineures. l'autre grand principe, l'occupation du centre par les pions, est réglée depuis le 4ème coup.
-------------------------------------
 ne pas oublier ce grand adage (que je viens tout juste d'inventer) : un roi peureux est un roi vivant. note en français : aller au 10ème coup.
-------------------------------------
 je soupçonne que les noirs veulent fermer le jeu à tout prix. mais, en jouant ce coup, ils justifient en quelque sorte le plan des blancs. les cases blanches sont encore plus faibles. la case b5 va devenir le point d'ancrage des blancs en territoire ennemi. i will go with the horse. just on general principles. the bishop will control more ground where it is.
-------------------------------------
 ce cheval fera l'affaire. le fou contrôle plus d'espace si je le laisse où il est. an interesting attempt to try and prove whith wrong. with his last move.
-------------------------------------
 tentative intéressante. le dernier coup des blancs était-il le bon? no comments here. pas de commentaire ici.
-------------------------------------
 note du 8ème coup : quel coup jouer dans une position de ce genre. il y a en effet beaucoup de coups jouables. dans une position 'positionnelle' (s'cusez le pléonasme), fermée, comme celle-ci, il est important d'appliquer la recette napoléonienne (examen du champ de bataille, plan de campagne, et ensuite     à l'attaque!). tartakover a dit : la stratégie, c'est savoir quoi faire quand il n'y a rien à faire. c'est la cas ici : pas de coup évident qui puisse donner un avantage immédiat. il faut donc user de stratégie, et une stratégie se bâtit en 3 étapes : examen de la position, plan de bataille, coup à jouer. un exemple, basé sur le coup que les blancs doivent jouer ici. 
-------------------------------------
 examen de la position (je simplifie un peu, parce qu'il y aurait d'autres choses à examiner aussi) : cases blanches faibles du côté des noirs. 
-------------------------------------
 plan : placer mes pièces dans ce coin-là, elles seront difficiles à déloger. 
-------------------------------------
 coup à jouer : le cavalier ou le fou en b5. 
-------------------------------------
 là, il faut tout de même que j'essaie de voir lequel est le meilleur, en calculant les conséquences, et ça, c'est l'aspect tactique du jeu qui est toujours là à côté de l'aspect stratégique. ici, je décide qu'il serait bon de pousser le pion  a pour donner une meilleure protection à la pièce que je compte installer en b5, et, aussi, je ne suis pas obligé de décider tout de suite si ce sera le cavalier ou le fou.
-------------------------------------
 est-ce efficace de procéder ainsi? en pratique, on peut examiner 4 ou 5 caractéristiques d'une position ; une fois choisi laquelle on veut exploiter, ceci peut nous amener vers 2 ou 3 plans différents, rarement plus. une fois un plan choisi, l'exécution de ce plan laisse 2 ou 3 coups possibles à examiner. ça me semble pas mal plus simple que de rester pris avec 25 possibilités, comme ici, si je n'ai pas de plan.
-------------------------------------
 je ne veux pas dire que c'est facile de trouver le bon plan (en fait, c'est probablement ça le plus difficile à faire aux échecs), mais si on essaie, avec la pratique, on  seems ok at first...
-------------------------------------
 ça semble beau à première vue... black will lose a piece. how could black have avoided this situation. he might have noticed before making his move that the bishop on f5 is not protected and his knight on e4 cannot move to protect it. could this ring a bell not to play the bishop? or an acquaintance with this type of position through resolving problems?
-------------------------------------
 les noirs perdent une pièce. les noirs auraient-ils pu éviter cette erreur? peut-être en remarquant que le fou en f5 n'est pas protégé et que le cavalier ne peut jouer nulle part pour le protéger. résoudre des problèmes peut aussi aider à reconnaître ce type de position.
-------------------------------------
 les noirs tentent de faire le mieux possible dans les circonstances. le cavalier est cloué et surtout la menace bh4 plane... home sweet home. but is the fork at e4 dangerous?
-------------------------------------
 le roi rentre à la maison. mais attention à la fourchette en e4. f5 is met with bishop to e2.
-------------------------------------
 pet-être que ce coup n'est pas nécessaire, mais il donne la case h2 pour le cavalier. black has played this bishop three times on the last four moves...
-------------------------------------
 ce fou a été joué trois fois au cours des quatre derniers coups... better nd7
-------------------------------------
 cavalier en d7 était préférable this is almost forced, but quite good. b6 is in danger.
-------------------------------------
 par contre, ce coup, pratiquement forcé, est correct pour les blancs, et consolide l'emprise des blancs du côté dame. le pion b6 est maintenant en réel danger. again, nd7 was better. this queen is just back to its original square.
-------------------------------------
 encore ici, nd7 aurait été meilleur. la dame est simplement revenue à sa case départ. consolidation.
-------------------------------------
 à l'attaque, moussaillons! logical follow-up on the last move. this rook will be very useful and yet be out of the range of the black bishops.
-------------------------------------
 justifie le dernier coup. la tour sera utile et sera hors de portée des fous noirs. was bc1 better? 
-------------------------------------
 aurait-il été mieux de placer ce fou en c1? these pawns are becoming dangerous.
-------------------------------------
 les moussaillons commencent à énerver les blancs. ils sont vraiment mal élevés. white is glad to have this move available.  21. bf2, while still a mistake, was not so bad.
-------------------------------------
 heureusement qu'il y a ce coup.  21. bf2 n'était pas si mauvais. better to take now, so the king will not be stranded on f2.
-------------------------------------
 préférable de prendre, pour éviter que le roi se retrouve en f2. trying to exchange a pair of bishops.
-------------------------------------
 allons pour l'échange d'une paire de fous. black should have taken the bishop.
-------------------------------------
 les noirs réalisent que la sortie du roi serait suicidaire.  the only thing that remains for white is to be careful with this pawn, and try to block its advance right away.
-------------------------------------
 la seule menace des noirs est ce pion qu'il est préférable de bloquer. black will try to at least protect his valuable pawn.
-------------------------------------
 il ne reste aux noirs qu'à tenter de protéger ce pion e6 will be even better for this knight.
-------------------------------------
 un peu tard pour sortir de l'écurie... so the queen can be in front. what a gallant move of chivalry.
-------------------------------------
 les noirs vont-ils réussir à bloquer la position? lets go pawn-hunting. not very elegant, but it works.
-------------------------------------
 la dame part à la chasse au petit gibier. pas très élégant, mais ça marche. and black gave up. the pawns will produce so many queens to help break the wall around the king.
-------------------------------------
 et les noirs ont abandonné. malgré le blocus, les pions blancs pourront ajouter un bataillon de dames aux blancs. 
-------------------------------------
in this, the third of our 'coaching' games, i relayed my thought processes - in fairly general terms - in the chat column.  it is a pity i didn't preserve them in some way.  neither side played very accurately - but i think there is plenty of interest here. dutch defence.  whenever i play this i have the stonewall in mind.  very occasionally, though, i follow with the leningrad dutch instead. theory holds this as one of white's best - certainly a very popular - responses to the dutch defence.  for all its solid, defensive appellation and appearance, the stonewall is in fact quite an aggressive line, as is the dutch overall.  that f-pawn move rather says to white: 'i going toe to toe with you, so watch it!'  white builds as strong a defence as she can on the k-side. normally i play 2...e6, but this knight development is equally good.  it is just transposing moves. the space having been cleared for the bishop, the bishop occupies it at once. definitely aiming for the stonewall formation of pawns at f5, d5 and e6, c6.  it is a very solid and strong centre formation.  there are several of downsides, though. one is that the dark squares, especially e5, can be infiltrated by white.  another is that black's light-square bishop can become something of a problem child - what to do with it?  yet the line was good enough for gm m. botvinnik to adopt it in world championship match games.  indeed both players tried it at least once each the botvinnik-bronstein match of 1951. interrupting the programme in favour of development.  the move 5...c6 would have been thematic and fine, but the move played is still 'book'.  incidentally, when playing the stonewall, i much prefer, if i can, to develop the bishop at d6 rather than e7. rather conservative, i thought.  the move is solid enough, and quite safe, but the drawback (it seems to me) is that subsequently white will have trouble formulating a plan.  i was expecting 6.c4, here, to which i was planning to reply 6...c6.  this would have opened a nice retreat square for the bishop after a possible 7.c5!? at this point the gameknot engine (gke) assesses the game at b0.21 (the b infront of the number indicates a black edge).  but any margin less than w/b0.50 is really too close to call and denotes an equal game. had white played c4 the previous miove, this knight could have been developed at c3.  would that have been a more active location?  possibly not.  by this move, white opens up the possibility of moving the f3-knight to e5, and following with the other knight to f3.  that is quite a thematic motif in play against the stonewall, but it is no simple matter to arrange.  black might, for example, choose to exchange on e5 with a knight at d7, or even the d6-bishop. blocks the knight, which may not have been the smartest option.  i was planning to bring the bishop back to e8 after which it might find useful employment at h5 or g6.  the gke now calls the game so nearly equal it makes no difference: w0.03. this retreat might look unnecessary and timid, but it harbours (or ought to do) some nasty intent.  i really did expect that white intended to follow with 9.f4.  that had a big influence on my reply. [!?] gke calls this an inaccuracy, offering the following line: 8… g5 9. ndf3 h6 10. ne5 nc6 11. nxd7 qxd7 12. nd3 ...  but as its assessment is just w0.27 (from b0.30 the previous move) there really isn't a lot in it.  i accepted the line was probably too aggressive too early, but i was prepared to take the risk.  as it happens white probably had a better move than 9.f4 in mind, but rather to bring the knights to d3 and f3, training them against e5.  that would have been a very good plan and well executed too: 8...nc6 9. nd3 qe8 10. nf3 ne4 11. be3 qh5 12. nc5 bxc5 13. dxc5 g5 14. qc2 f4 15. gxf4 gxf4 (gke).  but this line looks fine for black, in my view. possibly better would have been 9.ndf3 as suggested by the gke, and let this pawn push wait upon activating the white pieces. black was not interested in exchanging pawns on c4, which would have been very pleasing for white.  instead i invite 10.c5 bc7.  white doesn't bite. all the same the gke mislikes this, and suggests white would have done well to follow up with 10.c5: ...bc7 11. nd3 g4 12. nb3 na6 13. bh6 re8 14. ne5 bxe5 15. dxe5 ne4 16. qd4 b6 17. cxb6 axb6.  it prefers ...nc6, but if then 10.c5!?, be7 leaves the bishop on a less active diagonal.  having said all that, neither line led to a definable edge to either side, the assessment still being well within the w/b0.50 range. this bespeaks possibly too defensive an attitude of mind.  much better was 10.nd3, prodding that tender point, e5.  true, black would have repsonded with 10...g4, stopping the other knight reaching f3, but then white could have begun preparations for queen side operations.  gke offers this: 10. nd3 g4 11. c5 bc7 12. nb3 na6 13. bh6 re8 14. ne5 ne4 15. nxd7 qxd7 16. f3 gxf3 17. exf3, which looks pretty good for white. really announcing my intention to attack all out on the king side.  this is actually fairly risky, as black can point to no real advantage to justify this.  nor is the centre fully closed.  i am rather trusting that the centre is sufficiently locked up that it won't explode under some counter action by white in that part of the board.  the alternative 10...na6 never crossed my mind at all, and i doubt i would have played it if it had.  i think i might have chosen 10...be8 instead. for the first time, the gke gives the advantage .... to white!  i admit that in normal circumstances i would have chosen to recapture with the c-pawn, with an even game.  but i wanted to keep the g2-bishop's long diagonal closed up as much as possible, and open up the c8-h3 diagonal for my own light-square bishop (lsb, c.f. dsb).  the main risk lies in the slight loosening of the centre, which can only favour white. by attacking the g5-pawn in this way, white maintains a slight edge. possibly safer would have been 12...nh7, but i wasn't interested in 'playing safe'.   but it was not going to be easy maintaining the knight at this outpost.  the queen's knight is far too distant. thematic and good.  i had a long think at this point - even considered exchanging on e5.  the knight exerts considerable influence on the light squares in black's position - a real nuisance, withal.  at the same time, white threatens 14.f3, to which i figured i'd have to reply 14...nc5 and if 15.dxc5, bxe5.   played after much thought.  it was probably just as well to make way for the queen's knight, and to entrench the e8-h5 diagonal as well. instead, 13...qf6 would probably have been as good an option.  at this point the gke assessed the position as w1.27 - advantage, white. [?] this move wipes out all that advantage, according to the gke, and i'm inclined to agree.  i can see why white would have seen the development of this bishop as a matter of urgency, but, having waited this long, and with nowhere really useful to go, it should have waited further.  for example, 14.f3! nc5  15.f4! gxf4 16.bxf4 ne6  17.qd2 would have left white with a great position, and black with problems to solve.  it would have been hard to see any way to revivify the morobund k-side attack. the obvious response, as black's attack gathers momentum. [?!]  for the first time, the advantage swings in favour of black (gke b0.60).  instead 15.f3!? nxg3!? 16.hxg3 fxe3 19.qd3 ... left a very murky position much harder to call. driving back the bishop, and opening up the g-file.  the big concern i have is that black's king is far more exposed to the elements than is white's.  if white ever manages to wrest back the initiative, my king might find himself lacking shelter from the storm.   a rather dismal retreat.  i probably would not have exchanged it for my knight had it gone to d2, rather leaving it to shut in the white queen.  what is keeping white in the game is that stout knight in e5. completing development and threatening to win a pawn by exchanging on e5. [?!] one feels that something like 17.nf3 would have kept the pawn.  but black would have had a free hand to build up an attack. oddly enough, not an easy decision.  exchanging knights would have kept the dsb, but white would simply have blocked the f-pawn (f2-f3) to close off its action towards h2.  i figured a knight on e5 would have more scope than the bishop. i really expected something like qh3, here, not so much because it would have been objectively better, but it would have been a more active placing.  black's edge is becoming more pronounced (gke b1.70).  that white is confined to just two ranks makes a dark impression.  one should note, here, that although white has the 'bishop pair', that motif is pretty much irrelevant in this game. threatening, among other things, ...ng4 and/or ...f3.  [?] up until now, despite impressions, white was still in the fight.  in view of the threatened ,,,f3 and ...ng4, 20.f3! would have cut across both and forced black to recast his plans.  one possibility was 20.f3 ng3!  21.qe1! ... not 21.hxg3? fxg3  22.rf2  h4 with a strong attack for black. you can see, though, that white was conscious of the pressure on f2.  not playable was 20.bxe4 ... on account of 20...ng4! 21.bxd5ch bf7 22.kg2 f3ch 23.kxf3 ...(the alternatives are equally dire) ...bxd5#. [!] there was no passing up this opportunity.  black now has a near-on winning game. [??] oops.  the irony is that i thought first of 21...nxf3ch  22.bxf3 rxf3, and came this close -><- to playing it.  but it was hard to see any decisive follow-up.  so, as one does, i bethought me of reversing the move order, which seemed to offer so much more.  i've known it reap dividends.  not this time... [?] that was a piece of luck for me, and black 'regains' the winning edge.  instead, 22.nd4! - a move i completely overlooked - would have wiped out almost all the advantage i had: 22. nd4 rf7 23. f3 qxe1 24. rxe1 nd3 25. re2 nxc1 26. rxc1 nd6 27. bh3 rg7+ 28. kf2 bg6 29. ne6 re7 30. rg1.   here come the reinforcements.  white can not, of course, take the rook. [?!]  the gke pilloried this move, though it still retains a winning edge.  i did consider 23.d4, but i figured on  stacking further pressure upon the besieged f2-square. attacking the rearward rook.  possibly 24.bc3 was the better option, trying to eliminate some of the nearest attackers.  as it happened the text move opened up an interesting, spectacular idea... in its assessment of white's previous move, the gke suggested 24...c5.  i much preferred the direct approach.  partly this was in the hope of this spectacular line: 25.bxf8 qxh2ch!  26.kxh2 nf3ch 27.kh1 ng3#. the obvious response.  even though 25.bd6 may be objectively better - stopping the queen sacrifice at h2, for one thing - the difference between assessments of minus 8 and minus 11 is neither here nor there: both represent games too far gone to be salvageable. now black's last reserves have joined the attack. better - and the move i expected - was 26.bd6.  but, annoyingly enough, the text move also prevents the q sacrifice at h2, because f3 is now adequately protected against it. [!?] instead, ...bg4. an oversight that terminates the game at once.  but white was scarcely going to contemplate qxf3, the only way to prevent an immediate mate, was she?  e.g. 27.qxf3 rxf3  28.bxf3 qf2ch 29.kh1 qxf3ch  30.ng2 bh3  31.rg1 nf2#.  
-------------------------------------
coaching match... a very close match which demonstrates the strength of linked pawns vs loose pawns in an endgame... with each move, i will also post the gamenotes as discussed during the game as an added insight (they will be in these <<>> things), though there are one or two occasions where i made some errors of judgement, and only with the benefit of hindsight was i able to see how silly i sounded, especially when i predict white's collapse!  <<<(taufiq) my "normal" opening.. >>> not my usual opening, in fact i never play e5. currently i'd most likely play caro-kann (c6), though i often play sicilian (c5) or french (e6) also... but this, i am led to believe, is a better opening for training purposes...  <<<(tugger) e4 is my usual opening too... normally, i'd reply with c5, as i belive it to be blacks strongest defence, but i will play e5, as i'm told it provides a better chance to learn. i don't know if you've discovered it yet, but the database is an excellent tool for learning openings, take the link under 'resign' and have a look... it can make things awkward though, too, as if your opponent moves off-book quickly, you can find yourself lost in an unfamiliar opening...>>> <<<(taufiq) yes, i've allready looked to the game db, and i find it very helpfull !  now, the attack with my horse forces you to cover your e-pawn.. >>> <<<(tugger) indeed... i'm not comfortable playing nf6 and attacking your e-pawn too, and a gambit isn't really appropriate! i might look into f5 in the future, i like gambits! they can provide huge development advantages that far outweigh the pawn loss... for now though i'll stick with nc6...>>>  of course, i meant the gambit wasn't appropriate for black, nf6 could encourage the gambit (nxf7) for white, which i play often. <<<(taufiq) "normal" protection for my e-pawn.. >>> four knights...  <<<(tugger) i believe it is best for black to ensure there is a knight-balance, ie my position would be weaker if you had more knights developed early on... so nf6 is the natural move... your opening is sound as you are still forcing me to respond, as opposed to me making you play...>>> <<<(taufiq) in this case, i would dare to exchange my bishop for your knight, cause it weakens your protection for your king..>>> i'm pretty sure this move is sound. i have abandoned my pawn on e5, but this would be a temporary loss, as 5... qe7 attacks knight and exerts yet more pressure on the e4 pawn, or i could even reclaim the e4 pawn immediately, since my knight on d4 stops white pinning the knight (and yes, despite white's knight on e5, my knight would be pinned if white's queen safely occupied e2, since the discovered check nc6  would be devastating).   <<<(tugger) now, although this move loses the protection of my e-pawn, it would most certainly be a temporary loss, i would reclaim the pawn within a couple more moves, while gaining a positional advantage, at least i think... i also attack your bishop and knight, and i have brought my knight into a central position. you can of course take him, but then when i reclaim, your other knight is attacked... while this does not win any material, it hands the initative to me... i can now begin to build up a counter-attack…>>> <<<(taufiq) yes, very nice move ! most people counter 4.bb5 with 4. ... a6 but as you say, 4. ... nd4 is most likely a better thing to do.. i'll protect my f-knight again with my bishop..>>>  4... a6 would be a blunder, since the bishop/knight trade would leave black a pawn down and an inferior pawn structure. and white moving his bishop twice in the opening means black has a development advantage. <<<(tugger) it was too late to play a6, as this is a prevention move... after bxc6, i have to reclaim with a pawn, messing up my structure... and you would be able to claim my e-pawn for free... a clear advantage to you...  now i have the choice out of bishop and knight... normally, i'd go bishop, but this would simply aid your development after the queen takes... nxf3  will obviously respond bxf3... while you may have more pieces developed, i will still be able to hold the initiative with 6. bb4, which threatens your e-pawn and develops my bishop...>>> obviously...  <<<(taufiq) nice explanation ! very helpfull !>>>  except i made a mistake with my analysis...! steal the a7-g1 diagonal before white can develop his bishop.  <<<(tugger) there was an oversight on my part, though... bb4 does not threaten your e-pawn, as the bishop now protects it as well as the knight... therefore, instead i shall play bc5, as this gains the g1-a7 diagonal before you can develop your black bishop...>>>  just one of the many times i'll look a bit silly, but that's what was said, and it aids the insight to the game to see what was discussed at the time. i felt this was more important than castling myself, since there is no threat yet which demands it. white controlled d5, and i didn't want the knight moving in. and since my b8 knight has developed and been traded, c6 does not hamper any future development.   <<<(tugger) you have control over d5, so to gain some control there myself, in particular prevent the knight moving in, in feel c6 is more important than castling now... since my queenside knight has been traded already, this does not hamper development as c6 sometimes can...>>> <<<(taufiq) with this pawn-move, i'm preparing 9. b4, to threaten your bishop..>>> <<<(tugger) indeed... and the natural response would be a5... not only does this delay the attack, but gives the bishop an extra square along the diagonal which it controls...>>> <<<(taufiq) can't place my d-pawn 2 steps in front, cause it's only covered once.. in this way, it opens the c1-h6-diagonal for my bishop..>>> not too good with opening theory, especially this opening, but at this stage the game appears to be balanced, with equal development and no positional advantage for either player...   <<<(tugger) since my black bishop is active, i would prefer not to have to withdraw him to unpin the knight, so h6 it is...>>> i believe this was an error... the exchange will leave white with doubled pawns on the e-file... a half-pawn advantage for black...  <<<(taufiq) exchange of bishops ? or is that a bad idea ? are there better things to do for me ?>>> <<<(tugger) hmm... the only problem with that move is when i take the bishop, you must reclaim with your pawn. this will cause a double up on the e-file, which could be a crucial disadvantage in the endgame. i could consider myself 'half a pawn' up. i think maybe a stronger move would have been re1, followed by be3... this way you would be able to reclaim with the rook instead. on the plus side, you will open up the f-file for your rook. and, of course, you have closed the diagonal.>>> obviously to develop the bishop  <<<(tugger) one more developing move, then i'm ready to castle...>>> an attempt to rectify his pawn structure...   of course, i'm not going to make it easy for him...  <<<(tugger) that's a good move, simply bacuase if i take it, it sorts out your pawn structure, assuming you reclaim with the pawn... though i will decline to take, i will instead finally castle...>>> <<<(taufiq) yup, removing my double pawns, was the meaning of that move.. but now, in this fase of the game, i don't know what to do now.. :( my idea was to make a diagonal with the c2, b3 and a4-pawns...>>> <<<(tugger) yes, this has become a very tight position... i'm struggling to find a move too... it would be best for me to develop my last piece before trying to manouvre pieces for better position... i was going to play be6, but d5 would give me problems, so i must play b6 or b5 to develop the bishop... b5 seems best as it threatens b4 if you advance your pawn on a3, this would give your knight less room to move and he would no longer control the centre... also i have the option of developing the bishop to a6, which threatens a developed attack on your rook while stabbing the knight with a pawn, that would lose you material, but it's easily defended, so it might not feel there is any gain by playing it... after bb7 i will probably look at moving my queen, most likely to c7, then placing my rook on the same file as your queen, the good old x-ray attack... but of course this depends on your moves...>>> <<<(taufiq) if you re-capture my pawn with your d-pawn, you're opening a line for queens-exchange..>>> <<<(tugger) i suspected as much... it suits me fine, we're still level on material and i have a slightly superior pawn structure... we will both have one white bishop and a knight each, along with the rooks, so it should make for a close endgame... my plan should you take the queen will now be to trade off as many pieces as possible while attempting to maintian my pawn shape... if we took all the pieces bar the pawns and kings off the board now, i'd be favourite as you can only offer protection to your e pawns with your king, which needs to be mobile in an endgame, while my king can go roaming around the board looking for weak pawns... your plan should be to try and force me to double up pawns, or win a pawn outright...>>> not sure if this is poor play or not... i'm happy to encourage endgame, as my pawn structure is superior, so the queen trade suits me...  <<<(taufiq) ok, i'll try to remember your advice :)>>> another trade...?  <<<(tugger) well, since you've offered...!>>> <<<(taufiq) maybe not a good idea to trade such amount of pieces ?>>> and the bishop trade forced, though his g-pawn will move to the f-file, offering support to his doubled pawns, thus strengthening his position...  <<<(tugger) i don't think it was the best tactic, mainly because i can now also force the bishop trade, but at least you are limiting my attacking options too... it probably increases the chance of a draw, but certainly decreases the chance of you winning... it will be harder to win pawns now...>>> ! unpins the bishop with a tempo... see my gamenotes next... <<<(tugger) that's an excellent move... not only do you threaten a pawn, you also threaten rxf6, which would win bishop and knight for rook, a good trade for you... this forces me to take your bishop, which will mean your e-pawns will have some support, freeing up your king in an endgame... there is still a weakness in your pawn structure, but not as much as there was... then you gain a tempo as i have to cover my pawn with the rook... like i say, an excellent move...>>> and i'm already beginning to think i should've left the bishops on the board... still, i have the slight advantage... another attempt to rectify his pawn structure...   <<<(taufiq) still doing good moves, or are there better moves to do ?>>>  and now it gets tactical... i'm eyeing up the fork on e4, which is covered by the attacked knight... only two options for white...  <<<(tugger) i think f4 was an error, though only a subtle one... you have yielded a little control of e4, which, with your king and rook on the squares they are, is a crtical square... now only your knight covers that square... so i will play b4... your knight cannot move, or nxe4  wins the rook, and with it the game... there are little options for you now... you will either come out of this a rook down, a knight down or a pawn down... obviously a pawn down is preferable...  .  honestly speaking, i think this is where your position collapses... don't be disappointed, as much can be learned from this... this game has proved to be a very good example of the difference doubled-up pawns can make... you have run out of attacking options, and will now be forced into defence... i could have forced the breakthrough by advancing my h and g pawns until my knight could be brought into it on that side, had you not played f4... all you have done is succombed to the pressure of having a positional disadvantage... you ran out of moves...  .  i don't doubt you'll save the rook and knight, but if you need any help with the analysis, just pm me before you move...>>>  this is where my analysis is flawed, i predict here he will lose a pawn and his position will collapse, a bold statement which proves to be very wrong, making me look arrogant! indeed... the other was axb4, but that of course is merely a delay... he would then have to play fxe5 next go... and now white has three pawns on the e-file, a huge disadvantage... definitely best... of course, white had to attack the knight, or he would lose his for nothing... and if 23. kf3 nxe5  24. kf4 ng6  and my knight is protected, his is attacked, and he's in check... his knight is lost with any hope of winning...  <<<(taufiq) 23. kg3 is the best move, if you ask me ? in that way i protect my h-pawn.. if i moved 23. kf3, then 23. ... nxh2 would check me again..>>> ? with the benfit of hindsight, i think nxe5 would've been stronger, but i was greedy and thought i would take the lead...  <<<(tugger) yeah, kg3 was definitely best...  after good analysis, you're not yet on the verge of collapse, but i certainly have the stronger position now... those pawns on the e-file are a big problem for you... your biggest concern in endgame is the h g pawn push, with only one pawn defending... made possible due to your f-pawn moving onto the e file... and for you, i guess the best thing you can do is put pressure on my b c pawns, though i'm not sure you'll be able to succeed in winning back the pawn, i should be able to hold you off and pressure your e-pawns... you must avoid trading pieces, too... once you've lost one more, i can look at the pawn push...>>> no surprises... and there goes the pawn.  <<<(tugger) i think na4 was right, it means your knight is still in the thick of it... na2 was inneffective after nxc2, and then your knight would've been out of harms way... ne2 would've been ok in regards to extra defence against the pawn rush later, but i think you would be better off trying to hound a pawn off me with the knight and rook...>>> ! while i might be a pawn up, his rook and knight are mobile and working together, while my rook is tied down, and my knight far from the action... had i taken the pawn on e5 instead, i could've backed the knight up with f6, then my rook would be free... <<<(tugger) i can avoid losing the pawn and three-fold by playing ra7 next if you choose to attack the rook again... your knight is attacked... of course, after rxc6, so is mine, but nd4 now forks pawn and rook, while i still attack the knight... you will lose the pawn, restoring my advantage...>>> <<<(tugger) makes more sense to bring my king into the thick of it... threaten the knight in the process... while i have the advantage still, i have to be extremely careful now we're at endgame, as one mistake can easily lose a game... my advantage is not sufficient to win easily...>>> <<<(tugger) sorry i took so long on this one... i've been swamped since my internet connection went down... thankfully, i'm finally back... i've been having to make moves at work, which leaves little time for analysis...  anyway, the game... your pieces are currently much more mobile than mine... my knight cannot move or na6 wins pawn, and rc8 is pointless... i feel there is not a lot i can do... my plan here is simply to allow the rook some freedom... re7 will probably be a move i will need to make to pressure your weak e-pawns... if you had no h-pawn, then my tactic would be simple... pawn push! unfortunately, that will have to wait... i feel my chances of winning rest solely on those pawns...>>> <<<(tugger) i need to look at the following moves...  ne3  (seems pointless)  re7 (seems weak)  g6 (most likely at a glance, to stop you playing kh5 or kf5)  rc8 (to free up the knight a little, and protect from rd8  if i try to move my king around my pawns to g7/h7)  .  i would like to shift your pawn on e5 so your rook is not protected from attack by king, but i can't see how i can do this just yet... i think looking at this at a glance, i think i'm going to have to play g6 to stop your king creeping in, then work my king to g7, preparing for the pawn push... i might have to also consider allowing you to take my pawn on c6 in order to bring my rook back into the game...>>> i felt my king was needed on g7 and quickly...  <<<(tugger) now my king needs to be on g7 as quickly as possible... i applaud your persistence, you're definitely in control at the minute, i'm having to respond to your moves instead of the other way round... but there are a couple of things to be very wary of... for instance, if after 31. h5 kg7 32. hxg6 fxg6 and now i have two passed pawns with a king supporting... i can now ditch my pawn on the c file and advance... you will not have time to take my b pawn and promote yourself... or there is a mate i spotted, though it's an unlikely one... 31. rd8  kg7 32. h5 g5 33. kf5? ne3#... though i'm sure you'd have seen it if you began to walk into it, it's a trap to bear in mind if you plan to occupy f5 with your king...>>> aggressive... ! white was eyeing up the fork, he did not realise it was safe for me to claim the pawn... after 32. nxe6 ke7 and the rook trade is forced, with me a pawn up...  <<<(tugger) excellent... i'm finding it difficult to believe you're in the 1200's the way you're playing... i really thought i had this wrapped up about 10 moves ago... i feel forced again... i had a look at 31... re7 32. rxc6 fxe6... and now if you claim with the knight, it's good for me, but a rook trade from this position, without deep analysis, looks a draw... i don't think i can play kg7 now... i need to change my gameplan from ultimately advancing my h g pawns to bringing my king into the centre while seeking to trade rooks... i now believe my only hope lies with my pawn advantage on the queenside...>>>  this final comment here is where i finally start to see the game for what it is!   .  my problem with this move (fxe6) is i have now given you a passed pawn on e4... this is particularly difficult for me to accept, simply because it shows i made mistakes to allow doubled-up pawns to work to your advantage as opposed to your disadvantage... i'm not worried about the knight fork, since ke7 attacks both your rook and knight, forcing the rook trade... can't really work out who's stronger from there, i think we'll have a pawn race, both queen, and i'll still hold my pawn advantage... all other positions for me either allow you the pawn back or weaken my position further...>>> indeed... note how the position has changed for white from trebled pawns on the e-file to a single passed pawn... my huge positional advantage has evaporated...  <<<(taufiq) thanks for the compliment ! i'm doing my best with learning how to play chess.. you're helping alot with your explanation, thanks !!  now, i wanted to make 32. nxe6, but you've told it right on time, about the danger.. this is a safer plan to do, i think..>>> protect the pawn and relieve the fork threat, at least for now...  <<<(tugger) glad my explanations help...!  .  yes, rxe6 is definitely stronger... like i say, i was sure i had a sneaky endgame tactical move that would've resulted in a promotion each, with me still a pawn up...  .  my move is the best out of the two moves i could make... attacks the rook, so keeps your knight busy, and i'm vulnerable to a winning fork on g7... i think i shall lose a pawn soon... when that comes, i'll be forced to make a decision as to whether i am going to settle for a draw and play defensively, or go all out to win, risking defeat... what immediately springs to mind is trading your pawn on b3 for my knight... that would give me two linked passed pawns, which might just be enough to force the win... but of course, it's a dangerous tactic, as i'd then be down material... i'll have to look at that when i see what you play...>>> ! and white will reclaim the pawn, a result of my greed earlier on... my lead was an illusion... i should've played for position rather than material... make sure he's gone... i will lose my pawn on h6 in no time...   <<<(tugger) as expected...  gxh5 is forced, or i lose both pawns for nothing...  .  i thought this was a certain draw from here, but i do believe there is a little more chess to be played here... i still hold one very small advantage... my pawns can link... if the position is right, it could certainly be the difference in endgame... but of course, you have a passed pawn...  .  my initial plan of trading off my knight for your pawn on b3 will fail to win, since you can sac your knight also to ensure the draw... failure to take the pawn would lose... i could play it to force the draw myself, as i could still lose, but why take a draw when one of us can still win...? there could be a good endgame lesson to come...!>>>  again, my analyisis is spot on, as opposed to flawed earlier in the game. i point out the small advantage i have is my pawns can link, and how it can make the difference in endgame. this proves to be true in this case. encourage his rook to take the pawn as opposed his king... i'm also keeping open my options of forcing the draw, as nxb3 will give me two passed pawns, forcing white to concede his material advantage by sacrificing his knight too, which would leave a simple draw for both. and i'm covering e6, where there is a potential for a fork.  <<<(tugger) there are three reasons for this move...  1. it keeps my options open in terms of forcing the draw... nxb3 (after defending rh7 ) will draw...  2. it also defends the potential knight fork, ne6 , if and when i occupy d8 with my king...  3. it forces you to claim the pawn with your rook, giving my king a little breathing space, even if only for a short while...  .  of course, you can attack the knight before claiming the pawn, moving him on, but then i just go to b5 and the knight protects the rook instead of the king... no need for my king to be on d8 then...  there is no immediate threat of you winning my rook, which would obviously be a disaster for me... a rook trade would suit me, certainly at the moment, due to my king being more central... once my king is free to move in more, my pawns are much stronger...  .  i still think a draw is likely, though...>>> protect from the deadly rh7 , winning rook and game...  <<<(tugger) i can't see how i can force a win here... my main problem is i can't force the rook trade, so my king is trapped as long as your rook stays on the sixth rank... i would like to try and move my king round to the other side of my rook, but with your knight sitting on c5, i would walk into mate...  we'll see how it pans out, but as long as you hold your defence together, which you're doing superbly so far, then i can't get my king in support...  .  i really don't want to come onto the eighth rank, but e7 or e8 allows a threefold if you wanted to take it, and f8 or g7 would immobilise my knight due to the fork threat...  .  as tmepting as it might be, avoid chasing my king with checks on the sixth rank, as you would allow me to escape behind my rook eventually... i think that would seriously strengthen my position, i say think as i'm not sure how much of a threat your pawn could become...>>> this move is interesting... i had already discussed with my opponent  that if the rooks come off the board, i believed it would be to my advantage, since i have the potential to link my pawns, where his are loose... but the knight trade is likely to lead to a draw, provided he can contain my king...  <<<(taufiq) going for an exchange of the knights ? or are there better options for me ?>>> <<<(tugger) interesting... i didn't expect it, i have to admit... your knight was well poisitoned to keep my king at bay... i had a look at the crazy 36... nxb3, but after 37. nxc7 c5 38. rc6 and i cannot advance any further, and i'm heavily down... so that's out... therefore, the knight exchange is forced... but now i can finally link my pawns, though, which means it is you that is fighting for the draw now, though i can't see how you'd have any problem with this once your king is supporting your loose pawn...  with the knights off the board, there are no combos that can win pawns, so it will just come down to protecting pawns and covering further advancement... i think we can both do this...  as for were there any better options, not really... anything else would just be passive, and would probably resulted in a draw anyway... this was the most forceful move you had, nothing could really win it for you... i'd covered rh7  and was watching carefully for a winning fork...>>> <<<(tugger) obvious move, really... brings my king closer to my pawns while attacking your rook... and you don't have a great many places to go... you want to try to avoid me attacking your rook again with yet another king move... and you certainly want to continue to contain my king... i need to find a way to release him from his cage if i'm to exploit my linked pawn advantage... don't make it easy for me by moving off the 6th without being forced...>>> again, rh7  needed defending...  <<<(tugger) i need to have a long look at this now... i think i'll be playing ke7, it seems safe... i think if you then force the rook trade, there is a draw for you, but you would need to be very careful... your king is just about close enough... if no trade, then i should be able to bring my king around my rook to escape, but you will then have the time to bring your king into the game... you should be ok for the draw even without the rook trade, simply because my king cannot attack your blocking pawn, i will have to trade off a pawn to remove it... then i don't have linked pawns, and it's a blatant draw... alternatively, i could try to get my rook the other side of my king to allow him out, but that will take a few moves, meanwhile again you bring your king into the thick of it...  the only way i can win is by removing your b pawn without loss or by trapping your king from protecting your passed pawn, which seems very difficult at the moment... or by taking your rook and forcing your king to take a step back (assuming he doesn't move in anymore) to recalim, that would win for me also... for instance, if i could take your rook now, i would in a flash, your king would then be a move too far away from saving the promotion on b1...>>>  oh dear, did i encourage rh7? i was doing so well with the analysis too... ? the smallest of errors, this move loses for white, and i didn't realise it for a few more moves yet. crucially, it is my king that wins, he is now free! <<<(tugger) i must be honest, i didn't think you'd play that... the rook trade is now forced... you've allowed my king to escape, and your rook is attacked...  the other options are...  40 kh6/g6 rxh7  41 kxh7  and you're king has been forced back, a very expensive retreat... i will promote just before your king covers...  40 rh6  ke5  and the pawn is lost  40 rh8 ke5  41 re8  kd4  and the best you can do is advance, though it will soon enough come down to a rook sac to avoid you queening, then you have two linked pawns to worry about, your king too far away and your rook alone unable to deal with both... despite being a rook down, i will promote to win... if my pawns weren't linked, then different story...  so you must trade or you'll lose... after that, well, you must be careful... i'm sure you can draw, but one bad move and it's lost... every move from now on must be correct...>>>  see? even now i'm telling him he can draw. indeed...  40. rh6  ke5 and the pawn is lost 40. rh8 ke5 41. re8  kd4 and he'll lose one of the pawns in the process of protecting the other... and moving the king to protect the rook is futile, since i'll just trade and force his king further from the action... this move is correct, in that it keeps him alive that little bit longer, and makes sure i earn the win...! off he goes... indeed... ! of course, white cannot take the pawn or my b-pawn is unstoppable... forced, any other move would gift the win to white and now my king moves in... ! wins the pawn... of course, white cannot protect the pawn, or attack my b4 pawn, or c3 cannot be stopped...  <<<(tugger) so... the game... classic endgame... there is only one move you can make that will not lose... first, you cannot take my pawn at all... here the advantage of linked pawns at endgame is clear... you take my lower pawn and my other pawn runs off to promotion... that means you cannot protect your loose pawn either, as that would involve moving your king away from my pawn, resulting in unstoppable advance... you are in zugwzang... whatever move you make will be bad, so you must opt for the least damaging move... so your pawn is lost for nothing... but that does not mean you are going to lose...  luckily, your blocking pawn is on the knight's file... this means there is only one way to your pawn for my king... note if your pawn were on the bishop's file, i would be able to bring my king around to your pawn via the rook file, but your pawn is stopping me from doing this... if the pawn were a bishop's pawn, then it would be a win for black...  so, the only moves you can make to avoid promotion are either... ke2 or kc2...  but ke2 will lose too... why...?  47. ke2? kxe4  48. kd1 kd3  49. kc1 c2!  50. kb2 kd2  and now the promotion square is covered... note when i advanced my pawn, i did not place you in check... this is the difference... the pawn forced your king off the promotion square... if i ckeck you when i advance, then you can move onto the promotion square... then the only square i can move my king to maintain support for the pawn is directly underneath on c3... but then what would you move if i played that...? the answer... nothing... it is stalemate...  so...  47. kc2! kxe4  again, you need to be very careful... it is vital you do not allow my king to get on d2, as this will allow me to promote... and you need to make sure i do not advance my pawn unless i ckeck you in the process, or else my king will get to d2... so again you have just one m as it happens, this was weak, but it didn't matter... i'd found the win... strongest was kc2... 47. kc2 kxe4 48. kc1! and it looks a draw... for instance, if play continues 48... kd3? 49. kd1! c2 50. kc1 kc3 stalemate or 48... ke3 49. kc2 and i can't get my king in... so, where is this win...? 48... c2! and this gives the black king a path to the pawn on b3... there is no need to explain the next moves, as they are the ones made... please continue... and now i break it to him i've found the win...  <<<(tugger) i have found a win for me... i thought this was a draw due to your pawn being on the knight's file, but i am wrong... that means the rook trade was bad for you (though the actual trade was not the error, that was forced, it was checking me that was the mistake), as everything you did since then was correct, your king had to start moving... anyway, it doesn't matter, as here is a lovely endgame position for you to analyse and see just how strong linked pawns are in endgame...  so... all moves will lose for you...  47. kd4/c4 c2 and promotion wins  or  47. ke2 kxe4  48. kd1 kd3  49. kc1 c2!  50. kb2 kd2  51. ka2 kd1!  and i will promote to queen with check...  or, best chance of draw would be...  47. kc2 kxe4  48. kc1... (this is best, see below)  48... c2! (the winning move)  49. kxc2 (decline and i promote, forcing you to take)  49... ke3  50. kc1 kd3  51. kb2 kd2  52. kb1 kc3  53. ka2 kc2  54. ka1 kxb3  55. kb1 kc3  56. kc1 b3  57. kb1 b2  58. ka2 kc2  59. ka3 b1=q and mate to follow  and, the reason 48. kc1 is best is because i will win quicker with other moves...  48. kd1 kd3  49. kc1 c2! and i gain control of c1  or  48. kb1 kd3  49. kc1 c2! and same again...  .  the one move i haven't spent a lot of time on is your remaining move... 47. e5 but after ... kxe5 you're still no better off, you cannot stand still on c2...>>> ! and here is the winning move... i could've played kd3 first, that would've been a quicker win, but i wanted to demonstrate a pawn sac to win an endgame... and i didn't want the weak ke2 to be the reason he lost...  <<<(tugger) i had two options here... kd3 was one option, but i have gone for the more tactical c2!, as it is a perfect exapmle of a pawn sac winning an endgame... it will demonstrate the strength of the king in endgame... i feel there is a little more to learn this way...  .  how well do you finish your opponent off when you have a won game...? i assume you have no problems with q vs k, or r vs k, but if you would like, i will be happy to continue to mate or at least mate next move before drawing this off and concluding our coaching game... i will promote to rook or queen, as you desire... otherwise, i will offer the draw after promotion...>>> <<<(taufiq) most of the time, it's going pretty well to finish a won game with a q or r, but if you want, you may allways show a little more details.. i'm curious how you're going to do this, with your blocked pawn...>>>  <<<(tugger) we'll see when i get there then... now i need to force your king away from your pawn... there are stalemate traps i need to be careful of, i'll explain the main one when it comes to it...>>> <<<(taufiq) you got him..>>> and the pawn is lost... forced... again, forced... ! kc3 would've gained nothing, i would have had to triangulate my king to restore the position, then move to a3 anyway... 54... kc3 55. ka2! kc2 56. ka1 kb3 kb1 and we're back to square one... other moves would've allowed stalemate...   <<<(tugger) kc3 achieves nothing, as ka2 threatens stalemate... i would have to triangulate my king and bring it back to this position, and then go to a3...>>> indeed... not that it matters, but this stops my king controlling b1, at least for now... <<<(tugger) advance to seventh without check... key to promotion... you are forced onto c2, and my king goes to a2 to ensure promotion... if i advanced onto seventh with check, you would block the pawn and it is a draw...>>> and it's game over... black king controls b1...  <<<(tugger) now... would you like to continue...? if not, offer a draw after you move and we'll finish up... otherwise, move and tell me r or q...?>>> and a shake of the hands and draw it off... it was an unrated coaching game, the result not important... what is important is hopefully my opponent got a valuable endgame lesson here...

this is a game where my pieces work harmoniously together. going into the four knights. rather than the common move in the four knights bishop to c4 i like the ruy lopez position for my bishop. clearing way for f pawn advance. here is where the game gets really interesting. enjoy the ride.  allowing bishop to move. ignoring threat of him taking my knight since my threat of taking his queen is stronger. i love how the piece being attacked is the piece defending the bishop. discovered threat as well as direct threat of taking his rook. i was hoping he would see the direct threat and react by moving his rook and thus losing his queen but he saw the discovered threat. i could take rook but then i would lose knight and have bishop under attack so chose to double attack his knight threaten a discovered attack on his queen and protect the knight and still be threatening to take his rook all in one move. seeing my position is better trade rook in order to get two of his minor pieces and still have discovered threat as well as threat on his rook still. couldn´t help but laught that he took away his only escape square for his queen. and am pleased to win his queen. could have taken with bishop or queen but saw that by taking with bishop i would have the threat of knight check winning his bishop through a discovered check and then trading his rook for my knight. also currently threatening to take his rook still so i still have two threats. he removed one threat but this one was simply game. i hope you guys liked how many threats i had going constantly due to my pieces working together so well. it made the game quite fun to play.

this has all been seen many times before. it was the old "main line" of the grünfeld defence, exchange variation. please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence#exchange_variation:_4.cxd5_nxd5_5.e4 from about 1960 to about 1980 it wasn't played much, it being replaced by smyslov's idea of 10....qc7 followed by 11. rc1 rd8, but this was rather put out of business by 12. bf4! so players went back to this older system. to quote from wiki "this was frequently played by karpov, including four games of his 1987 world championship match against kasparov in seville, spain, is the seville variation, after 6...bg7 7.bc4 c5 8.ne2 nc6 9.be3 0-0 10.0-0 bg4 11.f3 na5 12.bxf7+, long thought a poor move by theory, as the resultant light-square weakness had been believed to give black more than enough compensation for the pawn. taking with the king is just as good. notice how i also often play nb8-c6-a5-c4 while playing black in the sicilian defence this is just about forced, if white wants to hang onto the pawn. this was played against me when i had white in this variation. i was surprised to see in the databases, qb6 is more common. this seems logical, hitting g4 and putting the queen on a white square - which seems logical as white squared bishops have been indirectly exchanged. this indirectly protects the pawn, if i take on g4 he checks on f7, picking up my knight on c4. it allows me to win back the pawn though, so i prefer h3. so i hit the queen, driving it to an inferior square. to protect g4 and e3 rather than take the pawn back immediately, i ratchet up the pressure and he cracks. this drops a piece he can't protect the bishop and the knight. so if saves his bishop i take the knight he takes the bishop. i could have just taken the bishop, but i found something much stronger. and he resigned. why? give me some variations please!  i hope you enjoyed this game. please feel free to comment, please rate it on the star system, i need to know how i am doing! many thanks for reading dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
after going through a bad patch - losing 2 and drawing one of my last 3 games - i finally get back to winning ways! the match was played in a handicapped knock-out. if we drew 3-3 against our opponents we would go out. i knew i had one of the most favourable ratings difference against my opponent. http://www.cdchessleague.org.uk/results.php?comp=knock+out i was not expecting my opponent - he doesn't normally play board 3, their normal board 2 was missing. transposing into the queen's gambit declined, marshall defence. i don't think it is very good, it give white a strong centre. it scores well for white. the recommended move. the most common reply. 3...qxd5 scores even worse. it allows white to attack the black queen with 4. nc3. i seize the centre. at the time i thought this was a mistake and that nf56 was better, but now i see in the opening databases that both moves score about equally badly. the natural square for my knight. 5....g6 and transposing into an unfavourable variation of the grünfeld defence scores better than this move. played to prevent c7-c5. this move doesn't score very well - but neither does anything else! 7. nf3 is the normal move here. as i said, i was playing for a win and had planned 0-0-0. 7. qd2 is not in any of the opening database i have access to. a bit passive, and leaving his d6 square weak. so i castle. he develops. i have a plan of bg5 and exchanging dark squared bishops followed by e4-e5 and nc3-e4-d6 continuing with his development. and me with mine. he stops my plan. with the idea of g2-g4-g5 at last some sort of attacking move by black. the threat is nb6-a4 and qd8-a5. so i decide to stop that. he develops again. i continue with my attack. he mobilises his rook. and i continue with my plans. he takes. i take back, threatening e4-e5. i think this is a mistake. qd8-c7 seems better to me. so i continue with my plan. knight immediately goes to the strong square on d5. i take. i think this is a mistake, and he should have taken back with the knight, so that he can meet nc3-e4 with ne7-f5. now he is in real trouble. probably best, exchanging off my bishop for his knight. so the queen moves. he takes with check. i take back. so that if i check on d6, my knight is not attacking his rook. what would you play now dear reader? to check or not? at the time i was proud of this move - calmly moving the king to a safer square before proceeding. i figures after 21. nd6+ kf8 he would be threatening to free his position with c6-c5. fritz actually gives rg1 as the best move, and nd6+ as the second best move. he stops my knight coming in, but it is amazingly passive. fritz prefers kf8 or nd5. i was quite proud of this move too - threatening to play nd2-c4-d6 and also protecting the h3 pawn with my rd3. fritz still prefers rg1 - although nfd2 is given as the second best move initially, although given a few minutes to think, fritz changes to 22. re3 as the second best move. played to stop nd2-c4, but it makes his bishop even worse. fritz prefers kf8 or f5. fritz like this move and puts white at +1.8 now. this move seemed natural to me, although fritz prefers g6 or qf8. fritz gives this as the best move and gives the advantage to white as plus 2.7  now rg8? or rh7? are both met with nf6! his next move is virtually forced. but now f6 is horribly weak too. moving the queen over and threatening rxg6. fritz prefers h4. at the time, this seemed the natural move to me, but fritz prefers ke8 or qh4. fritz now likes 26. h4 still, or nf6, but i chose another move. with the idea of 27. nxf7 qxf7 28. rxg6 qxg6 29. qf6 winning. but he doesn't allow that. fritz thinks this is the best move for black.  fritz likes this move, but still prefers 27. h4 so he tries to block 28. h4 fritz also likes rd7 or nb6 i offer and exchange - why not exchange off defending pieces? fritz gives this as the second best move and prefers nf6. given as the best move for black, with rh8 given as second best. he certainly can't afford to exchange on g4. i take back with the h pawn and sail in down the h file. fritz thinks this move is best!  it is getting very hard for black! with the threat of nxe6 followed by qxh6 mating. this is virtually forced. i take back, with the massive threat of qh7 mating. fritz actually gives 31...qxg5 as the only move to prevent a quick mate. queen comes out to give his king a flight square, and a possible counter attack on my king. fritz says it is mate in 7. at the time i just knew i was winning. as good as anything. what would you play now dear reader? fritz gives this as mate in 8, but even better was ndxf7. if now rxe8 34. qh7+ kf8 35. qxf7#	 so this is the only move to prevent an early mate. with best defence, it is mate in 12. fritz says i missed a mate in 7 with qh7. one last hope from black - that i will take the rook and allow him to mate me with qxb2. he did play on until i played my 37th move, but i will leave here dear reader with a puzzle - how did i mate in 4 from this position? many thanks for reading. please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader!

normally i wouldn't take that knight, but after having looked at very old games for some times i had an urge to play old fashioned chess. too cocky ofcourse i missed this, what a blunder so early in the game! and this had to follow... c4 is a bad move because of bf5. i played it with a feeling of being silly, but never the less it turned out to confuse my opponent... o-o is really too a bad move, not taking advantage of my split-up pawns and overlooking the following move by white. + jeg står ikke synderligt godt, men har en materiel overvægt. for at udvilke mig videre skal jeg have kongen i tryghed på f eller d. da kongen nu er havnet på f-linien, c2 er dækket, ligeledes er e2, og ved yderligere forstærkning fra sorts side på e2, ignoreres truslen med d3 (forberedende le3 (trussel mod springeren)) da det kun er tårnet hvid ikke vil have stående på e2. springer og løber er ikke nogen trussel og kommer mere til at stå i vejen for sort, end den vil spille rollen som angriber.  meaning that i have plan for what to do, being in control of the posistion sort of... black wants to take advantage of the weak white squares. en naturlig blokering, der også åbner for hvids sortfeltede løber, som kan placeres på enten e3 eller f4. lb2 synes ikke at have samme effekt, da trækket kræver forberedelse med b4  it seemd to me as a natural blocker also preparing for the bishop to work sort holder løberen i diagonalen og undgår at ståi vejen for tårnene. diagonalen h5-d1 er dog ikke længere en mulighed da tårnet dækker h5. indtagelsen af den diagonal virkede for mig farligere i det presset ikke umiddelbart kunne blokeres af hvid.  maybe black should have looked at the diagonal h5-d1 and the square at e2. maybe there had been some pressure. lf4 er ikke nogen direkte trussel. i stedet kunne der som nævnt tidligere være spillet b4 og l b2 eller le3. den direkte trussel af springeren på d4 gennem le3 er ved første øjekast indlysende, men efter 18..., sf5 taber hvid et tempo. stillingen er ikke uden muligheder for begge sider, og gennem upræcist spil kan der opstå ubehageligheder for hvid, der er foran i materiel, men som overhovedet ikke har sat sig på stillingen endnu.  at first i wanted to plant the bishop at e3, but got scared seeing nf5 se6 var forventet men ikke farligt, da hvid gerne vil bytte af, specielt når afbytningen løser op for en ellers hæmmende dobbeltbonde. forbereder sf3 og en magtkamp om centrum, feltet e5 begynder. sort kan forsvare sig med f6, men det vil kun resultere i f5, og der kan etableres en forpost.  getting ready to play nf3, but overlooking nxc5 which is a step-back for white might not have been nessasary covering the pawns are consolidating the attacking quuen-side of black seemed undangerous to me, but later on it got a little dangerous this move wanted to provoke f6, but it did not give me anything playing a3 instead mighthave been more a standard defence, but i chose the following moves the fight over a2 takes a lot of effort for black, but the centre was too crowded  this move wins at least a pawn, but can black lose so many pieces? instead f5 or ng5 should have been played by white... attacking the centrelines  and a free pawn is coming... loses the game a bad game for both parts, whom both have a lot to learn about chess.  please give me a comment if you see this... 
-------------------------------------
mi segunda partida con kriti, la primera desastrozamente perdida, en un torneo con apertura obligada. suele jugarse, también d6. amenazo jugar ce4, con interesante dominio central, la próxima jugada es casi obligada otra opción, que ni consideré, ya que le tenía fe a este sacrificio, es exd5 libero la columna f para mi torre tiempo de estudiar el sacrificio, el rey negro está inseguro, pero la falta de desarrollo blanco, y lo endeble del centro (la amenaza es tomar el peón e, exponiendo el débil d4) no compensan la inseguridad real. las negras están claramente mejor obligado, por la amenaza anteriormente predicha era mejor a e2, pero, tocar el punto g6 es una sensación atrayente lindo sacrificio que simplifica la posición, pero permite centralizar mi dama. las negras luego de esto, ceden la iniciativa, aunque siguen teniendo mejor juego esta jugada tiene el simple motivo de despejar la gran diagonal negra, activando mi alfil y amenazando bajo rayos x acá creía estar mejor, pero no ví da5, desviando mi dama de f5, que permite activar el caballo de h6. esta jugada tiene el simple objetivo de cerrar el paso de la dama negra a g6. creo que d5 hubiese sido efectiva. el rey negro se ve acosado por las piezas blancas, cambié las torres en f8 para dar el descubierto con d5+ si toma de alfil. había calculado a 20 txf8 axf8  21 d5+ cf6 22 e7 obviamente a esta casilla, es gratificante para mí observar que el rey no puede ir a e8 por el jaque de dama en g6, posibilitado gracias a la jugada 19 cedo la casilla e4 para el caballo, y con la dama busco la casilla g5, todas mis piezas atacan, mientras la dama en a6 está extraviada a dxa2, atacando el alfil indefenso, sigue dg5+. el negro devuelve la pieza para activar la dama. interesante jugada, que no tuve en cuenta que la aceptación inmediata del caballo conduce a un final con un peón más de las negras. si el caballo no se toma, controla las casillas c7 y g5. luego de meditar minutos frente a la pc, encontré esta jugada tan simple como eficaz, teniendo en cuenta que ahora queda amenazado el alfil en e7 y con eso, el caballo clavado en e6, amén del ya clavado en f6. y la dama negra sigue sin actuar sobre el punto f6 recuperé la pieza, y se equilibro el material, pero la amenaza latente del mate en g7 gana el caballo atacado.  al comer el peón, solo había tenido en cuenta rg8 como respuesta, y pensaba colocar mi caballo en g3. frente a esta respuesta, probablemente el retorno a campo en g3 sea lo más eficaz, como demuestro en la próxima jugada. claro está que el doble con cf4 no sirve ante de4+ o dc6+ ganando calidad, quedando con torre de ventaja. hay que tener en cuenta los jaques de dama sobre el rey blanco luego de 32 .... txg7 33 dxg7 de4+ 34 rg3 dd3+ conduce a tablas. así mismo 34 rf2 df3+ 35 re1 de3 pero 35 rg1 de3+ 36 tf2, no es fácil ver como se escapa el rey blanco, creo que mi oponente debió continuar con la partida 
-------------------------------------
la apertura catalana, que fue empleada por primera vez en barcelona. de ahí su nombre. una movida arriesgada, que muestra ya el espíritu combativo de gurevich. lo principal es 7..a6. no tenía ningún problema en jugar una partida tranquila y posicional. era la segunda ronda del día- el torneo se jugaba con doble ronda diaria- y no disponía de las energías suficientes para jugar una partida complicada llena de combinaciones. comenzando con una danza de caballos que se extenderá hasta el fin de la partida. en este tipo de finales, los caballos suelen ser más fuertes que los alfiles. a pesar de haber peones en ambos flancos, los negros del flanco de dama están muy avanzados y fijados, y pronto se volverán débiles. si 30...cxc6 entonces 31.cxf6 jaque doble ganando una pieza luego de rg7 32.cxd7. aunque aún es preciso trabajar, el blanco goza de una clara ventaja. sin muchas esperanzas, gurevich abandonó luego de realizar su movimiento.

la variante schlechter está viviendo un rejuvenecimiento gracias a kamsky y bu xiangzhi.  las blancas han evitado que las negras se desprendan de su pasivo ac8 con comodidad.  alternative variation: [la respuesta más usual es] 7... c5 [y si bien las negras han gastado 2 tiempos en jugar c5, uno de ellos es la poco provechosa h3 de las blancas.]  las negras debilitan su estructura a cambio de fortalecer su centro, es temático, sin embargo, que las blancas aún no se hayan enrocado hace diferente a la posición.  ?un tiempo gastado? depende de si 10...db6 es útil.  aronian es un ajedrecista de un estilo muy original y agresivo, aquí nos da una excelente muestra.  curiosamente la captura del peón es la mejor manera de mantener más cerradas las líneas, se amenazaba la demoledora 15.g5.  aunque las computadoras son escépticas con la iniciativa del blanco, no cabe duda que las líneas abiertas sobre el enroque negro le dan una adecuada compensación.  alternative variation: [rybka sugiere] 15... na6 alternative variation: [ y con algo menos de entusiasmo] 15... f5  las blancas continúan con su desarrollo sin temer a la captura en e3 pues eso abriría la columna g.  las blancas ya están listas para jugar 19.tdg1, con una gran acumulación de fuerzas sobre el enroque negro, lo que obliga a las negras a tomar medidas para distraer el ataque.  hasta ahora las negras se habían defendido bien, pero este avance tan optimista es jugar con fuego, la dc2 entra en juego y será brillantemente castigado. sentado cómodamente y con fritz o rybka de consejero es fácil censurarlo, pero en la práctica la conducción de la siguiente fase por parte de aronian, despierta una gran admiración. alternative variation: [las computadoras sugieren] 19... rae8 [o 19...tad8.]  un huracán se abalanza sobre el rey negro.  la incorporación de un nuevo atacante es muy tentadora, amenaza 23.dxe6+ con mayor fuerza. alternative variation: [la alternativa era directamente] 22. dxe6+ qxe6 ([no]  22... kxe6 23. rxd7 $1 kxd7 24. qxg7+ [ganando.]) 23. ne4 ke8 24. qxg7 [ veamos una contundente línea de rybka:] ([o bien] 24. rxd7 qxd7 25. qg6+ $1 kd8 26. rd1 qxd1+ 27. kxd1 [con ataque decisivo.]) 24... ngxe5 25. bxc5 nd3+ 26. rxd3 cxd3 27. re1 rg8 28. nd6+ kd8 29. nf7+ kc7 30. rxe6 rxg7 31. bd6+ kc6 32. bf8+ kd5 33. rd6+ kc4 34. bxg7 [ganando.]  alternative variation: [peor es] 22... ngxe5 23. dxe6+ kxe6 24. qxg7 [con amenazas imparables.]  lo más elegante , había varias opciones interesantes, pero esto es lo más artístico.  alternative variation: [no es mejor] 24... qc6 [ las blancas despejan la columna e con ataque decisivo:] 25. nxc5+ nxc5 26. bxc5 qxc5 27. rde1+ ne3 28. fxe3 fxe3 29. rh6+ [y mate rápido.] alternative variation: [ lo más resistente parecía] 24... rad8 [donde es muy fuerte] 25. qxg5 ngf6 26. nxf6 nxf6 27. bxf4 [y las dos torres blancas están listas para el ataque, que es muy difícil de aguantar.]  alternative variation: [en caso de ] 26... kd6 [las blancas ganan de un modo hermoso:] 27. nxb7+ kc6 28. rde1 kb5 ([o bien] 28... rfe8 29. rxe8 nxe8 30. rh6+ [etc.]) 29. a4+ $1 kxa4 30. re6 $3 qb5 31. qe7 $1 [etc.]  alternative variation: [luego de] 27... kd6 28. qe7+ kc6 29. re6+ kb5 [lo más rápido es] 30. a4+ kb4 31. qxb7+ [etc.]  espectacular remate.  y hay mate en 6 jugadas, dicen los programas.  alternative variation: [o bien] 31... kg2 32. qg4+ kf1 33. qe2+ kg1 34. rg5+ kh1 35. qh5#

(al jugar las blancas su caballo de rey en lugar del de dama, como en la defensa nimzoindia, las negras optan por el fianchetto -alfil en posición esquinada que influye indirectamente sobre el centro del alfil dama-, entrando así en la llamada defensa india de dama, cuya idea básica es controlar el punto e4, con un desarrollo elástico de sus piezas) (al liquidar la tensión central, las blancas facilitan el juego a su oponente. parece mejor el ataque inmediato al centro, con p.ej,. 9.e4) (jugada preventiva que prepara el avance b7-b5) (interesante jugada que amenaza b4. restringiendo el salto del caballo a  a4) (las blancas entran en un preocupante compás de espera eludiendo la tan vital iniciativa)   (excelente sacrificio posicional. pieza por dos peones) (aaron nimzowitsch se va instalando solidamente bajo un manto de camuflaje imperceptible. el bando negro pronuncia su “vae victis” particular) (esta es una jugada de maestría indiscutible. deja a las blancas sin opciones). en este punto säemisch se rindió. la amenaza negra en la siguiente jugada de t5f3 condena a la dama a cruzar la laguna estigia. aquí, se da claramente el fenómeno de la asfixia total o zugzwang; esto es, cuando la obligación de jugar conduce irreversiblemente al default, o lo que es lo mismo, cuando cualquier jugada conduce inevitablemente a la derrota. 
-------------------------------------
in otb chess i haven't yet adopted my gameknot policy of abandoning the kp openings against stronger players. the ruy lopez, or spanish opening, the second opening i ever learnt after the giuoco piano. the main alternative is the spanish exchange, whereby white takes on c6, giving up his powerful bishop to give black doubled pawns.  the game develops very differently. the orthodox defence in which white allows black to capture the e-pawn, if she wants, in return for an open centre and pressure down the open files.  black normally declines the invitation in the interest of quick development. the disadvantage of the spanish from white's point of view is the time wasted fleeing black's attacks on this bishop.  the benefit of doing so is the power exercised by the bishop along the diagonals a2-g8 and/or b1-h7.  this is seen in this game.  by attacking the b so quickly, as in this game, black gets the opportunity to force a swap off by following up with 6... na5.  otherwise this move order tends to transpose to the main line. interesting!  as explained, i was expecting 6...na5, but black sticks to opening principles, avoiding moving a piece twice, instead developing her qb on the long diagonal, threatening not only to attack my b but also the e-pawn at the same time.  looking this up in my old book on the spanish by alexei suetin, i find that this is the archangel variation, or a modern version of the møller system.  i don't remember ever meeting this before. i opt for a cautious approach, defending the e-pawn with my d-pawn, since i fear that heather's tactical ability will over-power me if i adopt a sharper variation.  the only alternative i seriously considered was 7. c3, providing a hole for my b, but i wasn't confident that i could cope with the tactical possibilities after 7...na5 8. bc2 nxe4 9. re1 d5, for example.  suetin also considers 7. d4, 7. nc3 and 7. re1, which all look weak to me but white probably has hidden resources. ? shocking!  i've never seen such a bad opening move from such a good player.  unsurprisingly this does not feature in suetin's book.  i could only conclude that she was trying to encourage me to "teach her a lesson" and overstretch myself or that she planned 8 c3 na5 9. bc2 c5 and 10... bc7.  the b belongs on e7, not blocking in the d-pawn, but protecting the nf6 from being pinned against his q. resuming proper opening principles rather than following the plan i'd envisaged. normally, with the black b on e7, this b stays at home while the qn goes on a tour of the back ranks before emerging on e3 or g3 and then going to d5 or f5.  but in this position, i'd defended e4 with d3 rather than re1, so i wasn't yet ready for that tour.  furthermore, the black b was out of position, so i decided to exploit that with this move. naturally, black chases him away i don't want to free black's position by giving up the bishop pair, swapping my good b for her n, allowing her to develop her q to f6, which would partially justify her 7th move. a sensible developing move, which also allows the b to retreat to f8, as it does in the breyer, where black also redevelops the qn via b8 to d7.  i seem to remember spassky using that system against fischer, unsuccessfully. continuing my development in the most flexible way. now it looks like black will regain a tempo for her fianchetto by launching her g-pawn to g5, pushing my b back.  if i cooperate with her plan, i'll have a horribly cramped position, so i'm already thinking about taking on g5.  i haven't yet decided whether to sac the n or the b for two pawns though.  both plans had their attractions with the f-pawn undefended and attacked by my bb3 and with the potential to make the pin on the black diagonal permanent. i make space for the qn to continue its tour if necessary, meanwhile reinforcing e4 and preparing to contest the file if it opens up after either ...d5 or d4. as expected i decided to keep the bishop pair and maintain the bind, which is more difficult to cope with than the attack on f7 now the natural reply would be 14... bg7.  here heather sank into deep thought.... and moved the b back up its diagonal to break the pin. now black can't retake with the q, so i can see that her k is going to be under-defended if i remove the n. immediately exploiting the open lines to her king. bringing up the heavy artillery before the cavalry preparing a discovered attack on my q to prevent ... d5, which would have cut my b off from f7, as well as pinning the n against black's qr and rendering it defenceless if the d-pawn moves. i decided against exploiting the pin with 19. qg6 since 19 ...be6 would have defended, forcing my q to move again defending the nc6 and the pawn on f7 but also preparing the manoeuvre ...nd8-e6-f4 renewing the threat on f7 reinforcing the defence along black's second rank now changing the focus of my attack to g7 and making room for my n to jump via f3 to h4 and f5 !? as previously mentioned, the n is hastening to the defence of the kingside, at the expense of the qr. nothing like a threat of mate in one! defending against that threat and cutting off my attack on f7, so now i convert my tactical advantage into a material one ! sealing the b's fate heading for f5 to renew the attack ?? ?? missing mate in 2, with 25. rxg7 nxg7 26. qh8    this was pointed out after the game by our board 1, who'd already lost his game and was watching. ! both defending g6 and threatening ... ne2 , forking my rg3 ! defending against that threat and bringing reinforcements to the attack freeing black's qb for action, to occupy the a2-g8 diagonal !? pawn-grabbing with a hidden motive.  it's easy for white to overlook the b's covering of g8.  the b can also come to b1 to attack white's pawns from behind. immediately planning to block the b's defence of g8 and also hoping to rescue my own b. threatening to take the b before i can do so so i take out a pawn with the desperado the pawn achieves its mission, buying another tempo at the same time ! both creating a hole for my king so that i don't have to worry about back rank mates and charging forward to attack the bg7, now that mate on g8 is again threatened. reducing that threat a nasty shock.  that note to black's 30th was written with hindsight ... but safely ignored black now only had less than 10 minutes left, whereas i had about 40 minutes, so i took my time and played calmly, relying on time and my material advantage to see me through, rather than going for glory, which would have failed, with 39. rxf6 rxf6 40. rg7  rf7 41. qe6  kf8, when black appears safe, as well as having extra material.  black's remaining time was enough for her to make several moves yet, with which she could have converted her advantage. ?? but i don't need a second invitation.  now i get an overwhelming material advantage that i can convert at my leisure. ?? better was 40...rxg7 as one watcher commented, white would be winning even without his q! black plays to the end. will i mate her before her flag falls? black had less than a minute left.  i had 28.  i think that perhaps i'm not making enough use of my time?  at least i'm making good use of my opponents'! 
-------------------------------------
this is an unrated game with brigade commander. although i had the advantage at various points, the game was extremely sharp and i lost my way in the complications. this is one of the strongest replies. black retains the option of qh4+ while developing. an alternative is nf3 nf6 nd3 bg5 and black stands well. this line produces more complications. white needs to drive the q back with tempo. this is a good spot for the q.  here ...bb5 is probably slightly more active. but black has a good game. necessary to try and get some sort of attack going. ! this is the only active move otherwise black simply consolidates. again, white must play actively. this is necessary to maintain the initiative.  !? black wants to break up the pawns. however the gk computer suggests rg8 13. ke1 na5 14. bd3 d6 15. g4 be6 16. nxc7+ bxc7 17. gxh5 dxe5 18. rxg5 rxg5 19. bxg5.  i thought this was stronger than nxg5. i analyzed it and thought that i was trading 2 pcs for rook and pawn. however, the gk computer considers that the best move: 13. nxg5 bxg5 14. nxc7+ ke7 15. nxa8 bxc1 16. qxc1 qxc1+ 17. rxc1 bh3+ 18. kf2 rxa8 19. exd6+ kxd6 20. rh1 bg4 21. bxf7.  i did not want to exchange the advanced n but at least i double the black pawns. ?! white must open lines. however g5! as suggested by bc seems better. after say qh6+ kf2 white has good prospects. at this point i thought i had a good game.  the gk computer does not favor this move, but i am forced to take. it prefers … bf6 17. d5 ne5 18. qe2 qe7 19. bxf4 bxg4 20. bb5+ c6 21. dxc6 bh3+ 22. kf2 nxc6 23. bxc6+ bxc6 24. be5 be6 25. bxf6 qxf6, with only a tiny advantage for white. i thought this was best, because i feared qxf4 qxf4 bxf4 nxd5. the gk computer prefers that line but seems to overlook that the q exchange is good for black. at this point i think i have a good game. gk computer considers bh3 stronger, … bh3+ 19. kf2 o-o-o 20. qxf4 rxh5 21. qxd6 rxd6 22. ng5 bxg5 23. bxg5 be6 24. bxe6+ rxe6 25. bf4 kd7 with an even game. here white is better.  ? this is where i go astray, missing the possibility of a sac on d5. as bc pointed out, after 21. h6! (gk gives be7 22. kf2 bd6 23. qg4 f5 24. qg6 qd7 25. qg7 f4 26. qxd7+ rxd7 27. rg6 re7) white is much better. this seems best. crunch! nxd5 would work as well, white's king is now exposed and black gains and advantage. ?? this is the losing blunder, i simply missed that f5 is possible. after the more patient 24. re1 qc2+ 25. qd2 rxh5 26. qxc2 nxc2 27. bf4 rg8 28. ne4 nxa1 29. rxa1 rf5 30. kf3 rd5 (gk computer) white can hold on. at this point i realized it was time to resign, but i decided to play on for a couple moves. ? allows mate or even ne7+ forking k and q. the mate is 28. rf2 qg1+ 29. rg2 ne2+ 30. kf3 qf1+ 31. ke3 nxf4 32. rf2 ng2+ 33. kf3 rd3+ 34. be3 rxe3# white resigns. 
-------------------------------------
my usual. now here follows an ominous buildup to what i thought would be an epic battle in which i would be in the lead.  the d-pawn must feel very threatened and yet protected at the same time. my opponent thought a while before making this move... he must have been mourning the imminent loss of his d-pawn. here begins the massacre of the king's pawn. ?? why not save his other bishop? this just leads to a myriad of other problems. trading off a minor piece. fork on g6. he spotted it. taking on f5 would result in a queen trade. here begins the beauty of the game. battery. i chose not to take the queen multiple times, for aesthetic purposes. pièce de résistance. no queen taken. i love this, and thoroughly enjoyed it! please rate and comment. 
-------------------------------------
this is an unrated game with jo having some fun with the damiano defense (ironically named after the early master who condemned it). we have both played it at various times. the gk computer game analysis is here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17800417&rnd=0.025789561332767663 ?! this move is playable and can be considered more of a psychological approach, since white has to be careful not to assume the defense just loses without effort. bobby fisher actually only got a draw in a simultaneous game as white from this position once and experts have gotten good games against unprepared white opponents from this position. safer is 3 bc4 d6 4.d4 nc6 5.c3... where black has a difficult defense. ! best. the chigorin variation. taking the knight instead loses after 4.qh5+ ke7 (4...g6 loses to 5.qxe5+, forking king and rook) 5.qxe5+ kf7 6.bc4+ d5! (6...kg6?? 7. qf5+ leads to mate) 7.bxd5+ kg6 8.h4 (8.d4? bd6!) h5 9.bxb7! bd6 (9...bxb7 10.qf5+ kh6 11.d4+ g5 12.qf7! mates quickly) 10.qa5! nc6 11.bxc6 rb8, and now 12. bxd7 qxd7 13.qxa7 leaves white with five extra pawns. consistent. the alternative 4...d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4 qxe4+ 7 be2 is playable but white retains an advantage.  developing and attacking the q.  now white is clearly better. ?? black does not have time for this move. instead black should try ...ne7! 8. re1 nbc6 9. bd3 qd7 10. bb5 kf7 11. ba4 qg4 12. h3 qf4 13. bxc6 bxc6 14. d3, when white's advantage is evident but not fatal. exploiting the e file. the bishop can't be taken without losing the q after re1. hits the q again, indirectly pinning the n. ?! looking for complications. it is clear black was in serious trouble if the q moved. i like this move, but the gk computer considers the immediate nd4 even stronger. in any case, black is now lost. ? to protect the b and relieve the pin. but much better was … bf7 12. nb5 na6 13. b3 cxb3 14. axb3 kd7 15. bb2 bg7 16. ng5 bd5 17. c4 nf5 18. cxd5 fxg5 19. qe6+ kd8 20. bf6+ bxf6 21. qxf6+ kd7 ! now the bishop needs to move, exposing the black king.  ?? loses quickly, but after even … bc8 13. qxc4+ kg7 14. ndb5 na6 15. nxc7 nxc7 16. qxc7 rg8 17. d4 kh8 18. ne4 nd5 19. qd8 f5 20. qxd5 fxe4 21. qxe4 black is hopelessly lost. of course... otherwise the piece is lost.  wins the n, and after ...kg7 15. qxd5 be7 16. ne6+ kh6 17. qxb7 nd7 18. qxc7 rhd8 19. d4+ g5 20. nxd8 rxd8 21. be3 c3 22. qxc3 black has not point playing on. thus jo resigns. 
-------------------------------------
not the worst. if nc3, ne4 puts inmediately white on the defensive.  the exchange favours me, but white... losing the initiative with be7 is out of question, so...  white has to keep guard of d4, and if qd3, bf5 has a threat (ng3).  pressure, pressure, pressure...  easy to parry, but still very good. i keep an eye on d4, now pinned against b2.  better than f3?? qh4+, g3, nxg3. ? g5 at once keeps the pressure on.  if white castles, i'll have it much more difficult. i don't care about my k this time, i have to attack.  ...starting a tactic melée that will come over later.  a typical novice mistake. o-o and ne5 would do much better.  let's party! i'll recover the piece, for sure, and white is not castled! and now, d4 will become vulnerable.  the idea is to win a tempo over the q after the way clears... and to start a pressure on the f column.  aha... you wan a tempo, but you didn't see mine:  white seems crushed, but... one never wins until the end. see my last game! i'm not sure of my next move. take it that white has bxh7+ and wins my q, so f2 was not an option. i didn't see qxb2, but nd2 and white holds a little more. no risks. this seemed to me a good square for my q. i have to be very careful now, since the position is very easy for tactics, and i miss a tempo to move my k to h8... safely. i am only +1, so i didn't win yet.  threatening b7. i'm glad to leave it to him, but now if i play kh8, qf6+ exchanges q with no further advantage for me.  ! covering f6. if qxb7, rb8, and then rxb2+ wins. it threatens a "fork" on e5. a good "quiet move".  white's quiet move is not so good! white could have played qg3+, exchanging q and get a playable endgame. i lost the chance to play ng4 here, forcing rh1.  now, i start cashing in.  bxr is there, but... would it be all? i looked hard, but black has rg1+ and i see no point in allowing it. probably, white has some mate net if i get wrong, so... this b was my headache.  it was not the better outcome i could have organized, but i'm still and exchange up. an unactive r waits for his moment.  now i can, finally, play the k there  no matter, white, you're doomed.  ...or not! i allowed him to pressure f6 too much. still, i have a way out of this. can you see it? it seems bad, because i can't defend it. but i have a "small" conterattack... bsed on qe5+ and rg8+... stopped this one, but...  
-------------------------------------
chess opening: french (c00), labourdonnais variation  todas las partidas que presento de gameknot, son  partidas de varios días. a pesar de que aquí se pasen con relativa velocidad. en el gambito rey, la debilidad en h4 se suele aprovechar. así como la debilidad de la diagonal g1-a7 planteando una defensa francesa, con características posicionales este cambio, nos lleva generalmente a un final de tablas. claro, jugando bien las dos partes. puede producirse un empate o tablas en el argot ajedrecístico. cubriendo la debilidad de su diagonal. ahora siento que era mejor, seguir con cf6, ae7, 0-0, y luego c5. el blanco prepara su enroque. inutilizando una pieza defendiendo el caballo, y prosiguiendo su enroque corto jugada más o menos fuerte, pero sencilla que marca todo  el desarrollo de la partida, posteriormente.    si 7...cf6xce5, sigue 8. f4xe5...amenazando dos piezas negras. sigue 8...axe2, 9. dxe2, ce4. 10.cd2, f5, etc. no cayó en la pequeña trampa, porque si 8. dxe2, cxd4 se pasa a final de partida, sin grandes complicaciones. todo apunta a un final de empate. este fue un error, era mejor retroceder otro error.  evidentemente si 26. txc5, txf4 he eliminado esta amenaza. con la cual, el blanco pudo haber ganado una jugada que me parece bastante pasiva, pero necesaria. invito a mi rival a unas tablas. mi rival se niega. de nueva cuenta, le invito las tablas. esta jugada, la pude analizar con fritz y en efecto es mucho mejor que cualquier otra jugada de la máquina que conduce a un final de tablas tuve que pensar demasiado. pero a pesar de ser activa, con esta jugada entrego el juego. pero mi rival, no profundiza. craso error. aquí era mejor tf3, trasladando el rey hasta e3 me embarco en una pequeña celada esta jugada que parece buena, no lo es. entrego el juego,  de nueva cuenta pero lo que intento es "meter miedo", amedrentar a mi rival para que este titubee. ha cometido el error que esperaba. bien, aún aquí siguen siendo tablas. ofrezco tablas a mi rival por  cuarta vez y él me contesta burlándose de que no conozco nada del juego, que espera que aprenda de él.  por supuesto me dice que los dos peones que tiene de ventaja. serán los de la victoria. otro error táctico. aún ahora, son tablas. pero viendo  la prepotencia de mi rival, decido no ofrecérlas más.  además de que le respondo, de que espero ver su gran  jugada...gran maestro.  no me responde. error garrapafal. pero aquí ya no son tablas, no lo son de hecho desde  la jugada 38. y las negras se rinden.  espero que les haya gustado la partida.  cabe señalar que aquí gané 111.2 puntos de raiting.

hi everyone!  this game explores how the tactic deflection is used to win material.  in this game it wins heavy material as a result of one player throwing pieces into the mix as a hopeful middlegame mating attack ensues.  will it be king henry or king richard who will end up under the cosh here?  you will have to read on.  ga is below: - 2. …… nc6 - after a double qp opening both sides develop a knight. 3. ….. e6 - transposes into queens' gambit declined.  i usually accept the gambit but today for some strange reason i decide to decline it.  ah well, we will see what happens. 5. …… exd5 - pawn trade. 8. h3 - preparing a possible g4. 8. …… h6 - prepares a hidey-hole for fou leblanc. 11. qxd3 - bishop trade. 13. …… 0-0-0 both sides castle on the opposite side.  this sometimes leads to direct attacks on castled monarchs by pawn storms or other things.  does this happen here?  we shall see. 14. ……. nxe7 - due to my position looking like nothing special and my middlegame tendency for passivitis you may think it would be henry under fire, wouldn't you? 16...…. h5 - the race is on! 18. ….. nh5 - things are just starting to hot up. 19. …… f5 - that seemingly passive knight on e7 supports f5.  i now intend to open up the pawn position surrounding king richard. 22. kxh3 - pawn trade.  well, i have opened up king richard, but how can i exploit it.  there is one answer …….. 22. …… qe6 - glenda! 23. …… qg6 now threatening # on g2. 24. ng1 - opens up a defensive line from the rook on a2 through to g2.  i am not discouraged and i offer up a poisoned pawn. 25. qd1 - white wisely declines this offering due to a deadly discovered check on the h column. 25. ….. rg4 - prepare to double! 27. …… rdg8 - and put white in trouble! 29. ….. nf6 - clears a piece off the h column and prepares to move to e4. 32. qxf3 - rook trade, but now another rook lands on g3. 33. qf1?? - loses large material by a stunning sacrifice! 33. ….. rxh3+ - like this!  wait for it! 34. ….. rh1+!! wait for it! 35. …. rg3+ - now!!  a deflection followed by a knight fork wins the wq. 37. kxf1 - for now white plays on.  sooner or later, however, glenda will demonstrate why a queen is much stronger than a rook. 40. …..ne4 - bringing up the cavalry - a threatened knight fork on g3 ensues. 42. ….. hxg3 - forcing off the pieces and it is now a pure q v r endgame. 44. …… qa1 - glenda shows her strength by going after the a pawn which cannot be defended. 46. ….. qxb5+ - another white pawn falls! 48. rc5 - overlooked that - white will win a pawn back.  however, glenda has eyes on f1 and g2! 49. ….. qxg2+ and now glenda zaps off the g pawn and clears a line to glendadom for my own g pawn.  time to set the conditionals. 51. …..g2 - the white rook can give a few spite checks but will then only be able to sacrifice itself for my g pawn.  this will then leave king richard and his remaining sentries at the mercy or otherwise of henry and glenda.  the alternative is to have the white rook up against glenda and glenda 2 - not a pleasant prospect!  king richard sees that any further attempt at continuing the battle will be futile and lets his sword fall to the ground - just like the white king in harry potter's philosopher's stone movie.  i hope you all have had a good read and there will be one more annotation to follow based on tactics very soon.  kind regards - joanne

this game is, thus far, my favorite bloody bout playing the dutch defense.  i was very pleased with the king-side storm i manufactured, and the tactical mêlée that ensued.  settle in for a tour of devil's den. 1. ...d6 is a flexible move against 1. nf3, and is one of my favorites. now with 2. d4, which i believe is best after 1. nf3 d6, i planned on experimenting with 2. ...bg4!?, the wade defense, named after british im robert wade, or 2. ...f5, which will transpose eventually to more standard leningrad dutch or antoshin dutch lines. i am always happy to get to play these three pawn moves off the bat against kia/english setups and claim a healthy and solid share of the center.  i call the d6/e5/f5 formation the "dutch wing" because it resembles a bird's wingspan, and this is the common ideal pawn structure in the classical dutch. white has elected to play the barcza system, named after hungarian gm gideon barcza.  basically a king's indian defense reversed with a tempo up.  a flexible hypermodern approach, however i'm always comfortable when white gives me a free hand in the center. 6. nbd2 is a useful "waiting" alternative, that doesn't rule out an e4 break in the future.  6. c4 now transposes into a common english opening formation. the knight is well placed on c6 in most lines of the dutch, often contesting or supporting the d4 and e5 squares, and well placed for re-development ala a steinitz-ean ...nc6-d8-f7. another thematic dutch move.  the f-pawn's early push opens up a road for black queen qd8-e8-h4, where it is well placed for king-side operations in the middlegame, as black's development scheme and pawn structure, "the dutch wing," positionally points in that direction. white gets his surplus of queenside space, however i'm not planning on spending much time over there. the position that has arisen is similar to many other classical dutch games, with the notable difference that the black e-pawn is on e6 in this position.  black usually expends two tempi to reach e5, whereas in this opening, i've gotten it for "free" in one. !? this move anticipates b4, and also "undevelops" the knight to actually a very useful square on the back-rank, where it eyes the light-squares at f7 and e6 (and may re-route to them) that the white queen is contesting on the g8=a2 diagonal, and frees up the c-pawn to potentially move. forced to cover the c7 square, however this was a square i wanted the qn to go to in any case, closer to the king-side where i'll be conducting most of my kingside yang to white's queenside yin. white gets his c5 push in, seemingly with tempo, however i wasn't really concerned, since his pressure wasn't enough to force a major positional capitulation from me. unpinning the knight and taking the king off the g8-a2 artillery range.  a useful and often necessary prophylactic move in such positions.  white forces a backward d-pawn from me, however it's well-covered by my dsb and white doesn't have an obvious way to continue loading pressure onto it.  i can potentially push it do ...d5 in the future as well, to support a massive center. covers the f4 square, however: ! another thematic move in the classical dutch, gaining more king-side space for an attack, and preparing the ...f4 break anyway.  it helps that i've moved my king on h8, and was able to redevelop my qn via nc6-d8-e6 to support playing just this move! white's qb has a more fruitful existence here on the long diagonal, especially since my king is also on it.  at the moment, e5 is a strong-point blunting it, but that can change in the future. as advertised, aiming at breaking up the solid indian castle white has built.  some may ask why i haven't bothered with ...a6 over the last couple of moves, and the reason is that i felt that white's knight was a tad misplaced on b5 with little to do, and actually would be more useful if it was withdrawn to c3, where it could eye the central light squares, and maybe jump to d5 in the future. the only way white can capture.  opening up the highway to his king with 16. gxf4 is very bad, since my kr is ready to shift over a square to g8.  he must maintain the structural integrity of his kingside pawns. contesting the open file that white wrenched open back on move twelve.  the threat is removing the guard on e6 with rxc8.  it also gives the b5 knight a mission, at long last. since the knight hits both e6 and my a8, i'm obliged to capture. in this position, i was initially going to play 20. ...bd8, with the idea of re-routing both bishops to c6 and b6 respectively, with and a lot of dangerous pressure on the king-side brewing after a subsequent ...ng4.  however, i saw that white could, and should, simply play the positionally solid exchange sacrifice with 21. rxd7 nxd7 22. qe6, with just as much piece play as nosferatu, especially with the two cardinals on an open board.  so i decided this was a necessary defensive move before i belted out any more shenanigans. on 21. rxb7 i planned on: 21. ...ng4 22. h4 ne3, and then snapping off white's light-squared holy defender, so my lsb could move to c6 with searing pressure.  of course, white should counterstrike in the center with 23. d4, but i figured i'd burn that bridge when i came to it. freeing up the range of my dsb, the f-file, eying white's dark-squared color complex, and basically sharpening the position threefold.  the position is very byzantine.  when i ran it through my alkaline-blooded rat junior 10 afterward, its evaluations changed a great deal the more it burrowed into the tread of things. ?? but this is not a simple win of a piece, but rather the blunder i've been waiting for so the rest of my army springs into action. ! the bishop cannot be taken, as after 24. gxh4 qxh4 black's threats are too numerous.  25. rf7 qe1ch (and not 25. ...qxh2ch?? letting white slip away with 26. kf1 ne3ch 27. kf2 and black's attack fizzles; there's no crushing followup) 26. bf1 qe3ch 27. kh1 (or 27. kg2 rg8) nf2ch and black wins. !? a good try in a grim position, taking advantage of his rook on my 2nd rank to target my vulnerable h7 point. i make a human oversight and don't find the most crushing followup, which is the zwischenzug 24. ...be7!! 25. h4 ne3! when the threat of ...rf1ch & ...qe2ch is just too devastating to convincingly meet.  after 24. ...nf6 black still has a decisive edge, but there's still wiggle-room for a battered opponent to fight. 25. rxb7 probably didn't occur to my opponent (it didn't to me), as white's counter-chances rest in undermining the central blockade of my pawns to unleash his own dsb. re-routing the bishop, with the nav point delineated at e3.  note that white's queen and dsb are poorly placed to aid in repelling invasive piece maneuvers into his king-side by black's army.  i can play ...be3ch with tempo, so white cannot snatch my e-pawn (bxe5) scot-free. white only has bad moves and worse moves in this position.  this hastens the end. removing white's last kingside defender before swooping in for the kill. white staves off mate (and its equivalents) with the computer-like 28. bxe5ch qxe5 29. dxe4 qxd6 30. qxe3, "only" a rook for two pawns down.  now a series of "box", or forced, moves commence as i prod the king from pillar to post. !! probably the prettiest move of the game, and the coup de grâce. 32. kh5 qf3 mate. and with my deflective pseudo-sacrifice, i'm able to win the queen. white resigns.  one of the most satisfying attacks i've conducted in a chess game, and so far my favorite dutch concoction. don't forget to rate the annotation, good mortal gameknoters, and freely comment.

i start with the usual no surprise here i continue so is he going to a king's indian or maybe an grunfeld defence? i continue what is this? maybe he will follow up with d6, going back to main lines? so i take the centre so this is what he planned. he was about 20 minutes for the match. i spent that on working out the best reply to this, over the next few moves, i moved a lot slower, so by move 10 we were more or less level in time i found out later on the gameknot opening databases, this was played in the 2 games on the database of world matches. this is more or less forced. now of those two games, kasparov, garry (2800) vs. kamsky, gata (2640) continued with bd3 and white won. after the game my opponent said he felt that he felt this was the strongest continuation for white, but i am not convinced. the other game continued with be3 and ended in a draw, - kurhinen boris (2140) vs. timchenko aleks… (2100) i chose another move, which looks quite logical this was played in 3 gameknot games he naturally takes back. now on gameknot database, there are three games from this position, g3 ended ½-½ iin tesomator (1824) vs. vandy (1939) f3 ended 1-0 in old_kondor (1835) vs. super-tee (1673) be3 ended 0-1 vicit (1824) vs. watbot3000 (1705)  my first ideas were to play this followed by qc2, with the idea of not allowing him to play bf5 followed by e4-e3, but i changed my mind.... he continues development. with dreams of a king side attack. the other game ended with 8.	qc2	bf5 9.	ne2	c5 10.	o-o-o	nc6 11.	dxc5	qa5 12.	b3	nb4 13.	qb2	nd3+ 14.	rxd3	exd3 15.	ng3	qe1#. very weak play by white! so he hits the centre i advance he takes i take back he hits my bishop i decide to exchange his powerful bishop he takes i take back he throws in a queen check mine comes back he takes i take back. now i think i have a very slight edge, because of his doubled pawns. but he has slightly better development. this was a surprise, he gains c5 for this knight, but i am not convinced it is better than ne5 so my knight comes out he continues my knight protects e4 i was quite pleased with this, it reduces the scope of his bc8 my bishop comes out he hits my pawn d6. after a long think i played this looks very weak, but i couldn' see how he could actually win it without giving me a pawn back somewhere. besides, i have a plan to support it with b3, a3, b4 and c5 instead of going after the pawn he mobilises his bishop to a better square i want to be able to protect the pawn d6 with a rook down the d file. i also protect b3, preparing my plan. so he continues with his plan and me with mine he mobilises his king i continue with my plan so he hits my pawn i hit his knight he takes i take back he takes i take back this is forced. i drive his bishop back.  he retreats. i had a long think here. f3 is possible, and strong, but i felt it better to go into a knight v bishop ending. so i take he takes i take back he takes i centralise my king this surprised me. why not just e5 to mobilise the king side majority with e5? now his be8 is in danger of becoming a "bad bishop" his king comes over i offer a rook exchange he avoids my king comes up not sure if this achieves anything threatening nd5+ he throws in a check king advances i think this is a mistake, allowing me to force off rooks. which i do so he takes i take back he stops my king advance this may be a mistake. maybe n-b2-d3-e5 is better. what do you think dear reader? he tries to put some pawns on black squares which i stop he checks king retreats his king stops me coming in. but now he las to lose material, his king can't protect b6 and stop my king advancing. he finds the best way to lose material so he sacs a pawn i take now he protects b6 so my knight re-positions itself he goes for pawn exchanges on the king side i throw in a check king has to stay on the b pawn i hit his f pawn he protects i avoid the pawn exchange, but the pawn is vulnerable on a white square he opens up a diagonal to attack it! now i have to manoeuvre my knight, so i can pick up his h pawn he goes after mine i am heading for f5 he takes i hit his h pawn he hits my knight i take  now the bishop dominates my knight. i think i have missed by chance now, i think this position is drawn. my only chance he takes i take he pushes i come back he goes after my b pawn i go after his pawns. there is an interesting variation here, 	bd5+ 53.	kxd5	f3 54.	gxf3	g3 55.	e6	g2 56.	e7	g1=q 57.	e8=q	 but it is still a drawn position - he can start checking me, and i can't stop the checks without losing my queen. he advances i take he takes back i take back. this is completely drawn now, i play on a few moves.  draw agreed. many thanks for reading this annotation. please rate this annotation with the star system. please leave a comment or two to let me know how i am getting on. 
-------------------------------------
after a long slump, my rating has finally crossed the 1700 line again, with the final push coming from this game in the 77th gk tournament -- a brevity ending with an unusual domination of the queen. my opponent, sokolskyb4, does *not* begin with the opening named after him (which was a comfort, as i find it difficult to play against....) instead, we play the first moves of a nimzo-indian. white must now choose whether to enter the nimzo with 3. nc3 or to avoid it. white chooses the australian attack. (not to be confused with the austrian attack in the pirc defence....) if the move is intended solely to prevent the nimzo, it seems a waste of time, since 3. nf3 would achieve this while also developing; but probably (given the word "attack" in the opening's name) it is normally played with the intention of queenside expansion. nevertheless, a much rarer choice than nf3; bco2 does not consider it at all. i'm not sure what black normally plays in this opening, so i try to take the game into lines i'm more familiar with -- a queen's indian, petrosian variation. white normally develops the other knight first, though i can't say i know why. and this is definitely not in book; 5. nf3 is usual, after which 5... bb7 returns us to known lines. the move played prepares to establish a pawn on e4, but it has a downside: the queen is no longer defending d4. (!?) black increases the attack on d4, forcing white to play e3 rather than e4. i'm still not sure about this move, since it blocks the (back) c-pawn; my original plan was to slip in this move before playing ba6 to hold the c4 pawn, but then i saw that this is refuted by qa4 forking the pieces. so, i let the pawn go and continue with development, hoping to make something of the fact that white's qb is blocked, and he is a little behind on development thanks to his q move. i felt the bishop would be too passive on e7. (?!) white decides to gain the bishop pair, but at the cost of time. (?) up to now, black looks to be slightly better, but after 12. 0-0 a long and difficult middlegame would be in prospect as black tries to make something of that advantage. but castling into the broken queenside just gives black an immediate and obvious line of attack. no marks for subtlety. black threatens to win a piece at once with 13... b5. frère leblanc is tiring of his guard duties, so frère lenoir hastens to take his place. (?) the wrong way! after 14. bd3! white has a much better chance of holding the position together. firstly, 14... a5 can't be played at once, as the b5 pawn would hang; secondly, the b1-h7 diagonal would be covered. why is that so important? read on and find out! in order that the bishop can retreat without qn-any leaving the queen pinned. since white cannot in fact avoid loss of material, the best play would really just be to abandon the bishop -- though white then faces an unpleasant middlegame a piece down with his king still exposed. after 17. be1 black has 17... nxd4 18. qd2 nxf3 19. gxf3 bxf3 winning two pawns and the exchange (thanks to the fork of the rooks). after the move played, the same line is available, but black sees something even better... ...the win of the white queen! in open play, with 14 legal moves available to her, she has no safe squares. the one line that may need spelling out in detail is 18. qa4 ra8 and white must lose the queen, since 19. qxb4 allows be4+ 20. kc1 ne2# or 20. ka1 nc2+ 21. kb1 nxb4+ 22. ka1 rxa2# (22. kc1 nxa2#). white chooses this move instead and resigns immediately after black's reply. just a small final note -- aesthetically, i like the fact that the f6 knight also has a small but important role in the combination. 
-------------------------------------
classical 1.d4  1.nf6 5.qc2 this type of game for white is always exciting. white play in to queen so early. but still nothing is advantage for white. 7.e4 control the middle more precisely compare to black. 7.cxd4 is a little bit problem. white night in f3 is positioning for the middle.  white knight also playing with more stronger line that is nb3. this allow white better controlling the middle game and also danger for black bishop. allright. this is the most crusal game and may be the break point for all game. nb3 is seem nice for black but it is not. this kind of attacks in chess always be dangerous. you thought that this is danger for white for its castle. but taking valuable pieces is not always win the games. i̇mportant thing is also playing strong positional playing. this kind of effort always one way battle.   ---- black give up position strenght for this movement with taking 15. nxa1 .----- black playing position strenght and sacriface its castle.  knight takes white rook but its a trap for black. positional playing white playing 16. bxc5. counter attacks has begun for white.  escaping kc8. this is sacriface with no purpose. white playing and threatşng b3 knight.  protecting b3 knight but still the situation is critical. open c4 line and also danger for bishop. securing bishop but white has a sacriace again. bishop sacriface is balancing the game and white getting more advantage. this is important. not to taking b3 and instead of play taking white play d6. still playing for positional strenght. one of the good moves of this game. i̇f you look carefully. black is has to take knight. there is no way to black take white queen here. ıf black takes to queen game is checkmate for white. (/re8 is checkmate)  and taking knight +2 point for white and also gain still positonal strenght. trying to cut re7 line for taking. sacriface again for white for its castle. but taking black queen and gain +5. queen has to take queen and white taking qxd8 this is enough for resignation. white wins. 
-------------------------------------
my usual.  one of the strongest response. black shouldn't lose the chance to move this pawn. he can, actually, go on with nf6, but he has to handle developement very well to equalize, and often castle queenside. all this is avoided with the text move.  i have to be very careful. black opened the way for his queen to go b6, threatening b2. since i plan to castle queenside and attack black's kinside (it's my principal plan when playing white), i dont' want to play b3. now, if black takes, i'll take back with the knight, since i don't want to move my c3 pawn at all, or a strong attack will come over me starting with bb4+. i'll take with the knight, and if nc6 or d6 is played... well, i'll see, i can afford this.  black goes for another good move, developing the lsb on the big diagonal. i have to be very careful managing this. accurate player can, i couldn't. now, i lost a good way to play my game by dxc5, bxc5, bd6!, but hey, ne4 throws away my hopes.  i know i won't be able to play e4, but nevertheless, i have to develop... and quickly. this knight can reach d6 through c4... my lsb must be free to check on b5 if black moves the d pawn. by exchanging pieces, i can improve my position. anything but allowing black to cover d6 or to castle.  now or never.  if black castles now, he gets into troubles when one of my pieces, b or n, go into d6, joined with b4.  right! as a good player will do. this counters my threat on d6. and ne5 is a non-threatening move that goes for a quiet game, where i am squeezed in and undeveloped. this is the moment that caissa have to bless me. i'll exchange pieces, queens and pawns, and my position will be decent. he will go for something more, i'm sure... right! and this leaves my queen's exchange meaningless, but... naive? not at all: i'll defend my knight by pinning black's d pawn.  not the best, but on qd7, we had a boring game, and the n move would have conceded a lot after ne5 - rd1 etc.  again, the crossed exchange favours me grately, due to c7+, so black has to decline.  he sopped my queen, but he is not more developed than before, and i still have... the bq can move to c8, but in that case, i can play nd6, forcing bxn, bxb, and black cannot castle, while i dominate the black squares. but this nice pin has a downside... yep, black can castle. now, i have to find a way to exploit my outpost on b5, controlling c6, a key square for his developement. i want my two knights "looking" at c6... how to achieve it? of course, black can't even think about d4. this is ok for now, but the opening of the white diagonal on g2 is a factor that i should have cared for.  as predicted, threatening c3, and avoiding my nc6. i can defend it by rc1, but hey, this rook will be undefended, giving some strange ideas to black... and my queen can't go to d4, or bc5... take this! ok, i'm allowing black's lsb to grab the diagonal, but it will lead me to be able to close it with a knight... very tense and interesting situation, imo... black, unbelievably, leaves c6... let's see: nc6, bxn, bxb, nc4... is it possible qb5? maybe all my "advantage" is just a fuzz... this will "force" him to exchange nxn, bxn, then he has ne4, threatening a royal fork, or ng4, threatening my bishop and winning some tempo chasing it. acceptable loss.  my attack vanishes, but let's see if i can do something on the kingside, that was my original target! hard decision, so many lines and threats... but the only one i was reasonably sure about, was black's response after... i know, g2 will fall. but chess is to fight, and i have anything to fight for on the queenside. of course, i was wrong. and, you see, i can't leave that pawn there, because it supports nd3+. i will win a pawn, but black would have had a great power on me, and i will have lost all the initiative.  thank you... now, i threat bh6. he can play be4, of course, but qe2 and i can still have some hope.  ? i went this way, instead, just hoping in a queen's exchange. i was worried i could have lost control of d3. but in doing so, i betrayed my foreseen scope, to attack the kingside. i later will see this as the losing move.  it's just ok. now, if kh8, bg5. if f6, forking my pieces, i don't have enough firepower to attack on e6 because of the nc5. so... !? well, maybe kh8 was better. this covers a lot of possible threats, and now e7, instead of a target, is a defended square for my... well, at least i managed to get c6, even if, in sight of the situation, i wonder if it was whorty, but look: it controls d8 (ok), and threats a royal fork, if ever the black bishop is forced away. i coulod have moved the other knight, too, since after bxn, be7+. i didn't see it at the moment.  with a threat on h2 i underestimated. i could have played ke2, and if qh2, rh1, starting a fierce counterattack. so my next may be the losing move.  thinking in "emergency exchanges", i only spotted this.  after bxn, bf5 will make me stay in the game. black had returned my same money, and made of an attack a vulnerability, by not wasting a tempo in playing kh8. very, very clever.  i knew this, but i will win a knight  if  bxr, bf4, qxb, kxb, and maybe - just maybe - i can resist some more time.  this is more interesting.  he will take the other bishop, and voilá. just -2. but i was too tired, i overlooked... look at my poor queen. qc1 was probably the losing move of the game, and with a strong opponent, one or two slips are enough. i just tired... i spotted rxg7, bxr, and ne7, royal fork, but kxr will save him, and i have no force to win. h7 is still a target... ...quickly covered by black.  no more tricks, now... after e4, with the treat of ne3+, white is busted. ng3, thinking in rh1, is futile against e4, that can be reinforced with one rook. after a6, black destroys my knight support, so i didn't see any hope. but while thinking about all this, i timeoutted the game.  
-------------------------------------
so here's a game where white manages to promote a pawn tol a queen on move 27, while queens are still on the board. so here's how it went down. the queens gambit accepted till here it had been rather normal, but this move was odd. developed the knight on the rim? aren't knights on the rim dim? black volunteers to give away the dark square bishop for a knight. hitting the bishop, and a nice outpost for the knight. this was odd because he just gave me the pawn on c6, with tempo. i made this move to prevent any possible ng4`s this was a mistake by me, i didn't pay any attention to the bishop hanging err.. this was the only square for the queen because of the thread of qg3 threatening mate and attacking the lose rook. gaining an amazing outpost for the knight on e7. this was a blunder allowing white to win the rook for nothing. best would probably have been to play an exchange sacrifice. snapping of the free rook. probably the best move in this position snapping of another pawn this was a mistake , because it weakens the a1-h8 diagonal pinning the bishop and preparing to play d7. black is in big trouble here. this move allows the pawn queening without taking the bishop. ouch, 3 queens on the board this was also a mistake, because white can just take it, because bishop is pinned to the rook with a thread of mate. exchanging knights here, not sure if it was a mistake, but that black knight on d3 was a real pain. bxb5?? this move seems to attack both ´queens, but white has both queens pointing at this square. maybe black should have taken the queen here, but it really doesn't matter, because its been a lost game for long now. deflecting the queen away from protecting g5 here its a forced mate in fact(atleast i think so) the only move this doesn't stop the wrath of double queens. and its mate. the guy i played against is a true legend for playing till the end <3. thanks for checking the annotation out.

comment un roi mal protégé aurait pu être réduit en bouillie lorsque la dame et les tours adverses sont encore là. heureusement pour les noirs, ce fut une occation ratée.  un peu téméraire, mais il faut mettre du piquant dans la vie quelquefois... ça va devenir un peu trop piquant. oui, les pions noirs sont un peu trop avancés en face du roi noir. faut être logique et attaquer de l'autre côté. pour libérer le pion f ce cavalier, même s'il a bougé plusieurs fois, est maintenant bien placé. ce roi commence à être bien nu. naturellement. déjà un constat d'échec pour les noirs. il me semble que je dois venir à la rescousse du roi, plutôt que de tenter de placer la tour en f8. l'attaque blanche s'annonce la plus rapide. un coup embêtant. je me résigne à ouvrir la colonne a, bien que ce soit dangereux. décision qui m'a surpris à première vue, mais finalement je crois que c'est très jouable. la dame noire va se retrouver dans une position inconfortable pour la défense du roi, comme on va voir. un coup qui semble mauvais: les blancs ne devraient pas en principe ouvrir le jeu devant leur roi, mais ici, la possibilité d'infiltration de la dame blanche avec échec fait que ce coup est très jouable. et ceci semble certainement être une erreur. mais je craignais beaucoup plus l'échange des pions  cxb  axb  avec deux colonnes ouvertes pour mon adversaire de chaque côté de mon roi... ouch! mais il prend le bon pion. !  maintenant, la menace  pion d4  a de quoi faire trembler le roi noir. ?!  il me semble que c'est le seul coup qui laisse encore une chance aux noirs de s'en sortir. c'est que maintenant la dame noire participe à la défense. il est clair que les blancs doivent éviter l'échange des dames, ce qui permettrait au pauvre roi noir tout nu de respirer un peu.  de5 laisse la dame dans une position plus centrale c'est vrai, mais ici il y a un petit piege... le coup qu'il ne fallait pas jouer...mais étrangement les blancs ici gagnent encore... le meilleur coup ici était probablement  tour a4 les blancs perdent une tour... mais pas la partie... il fallait jouer  roi h1 voilà pourquoi il fallait jouer rh1 plus tôt: les noirs gagnent un temps précieux en centralisant la dame (avec échec!). l'erreur fatale. il fallait encore jouer rh1. je ne prétends pas que les blancs gagnent encore mais il ont encore des possibilité très dangereuses à cause du roi noir exposé. maintenant, la tour blanche est clouée, ce qui va donner aux noirs le temps de se regrouper, puisque seule la dame blanche peut créer des menaces vers le roi noir. dc4 est probablement aussi bon, mais ce coup limite encore plus les possibilités d'attaque des blancs... et la tour blanche demeure clouée. le seul coup qui reste une telle incursion du roi dans le centre aurait été très risquée avec la tour blanche en action. découragement? l'échange des dames laisse une fin de partie facilement gagnée pour les noirs.  sinon, roi h1 ne fonctionne pas à cause de  d a1 ; et d a2 peut être paré avec t(h1)-f1 (l'autre tour pourra parer en b6)  
-------------------------------------
queen’s gambit! declined a very weird opening  castling long... development completed  double guard behind in material  pawn grab and threatening mate better was nf6+, forking the king queen and rook  oh no... the saving move check bye bye bye bye queen  classic endgame  stupid knight! !? !? stalemate!!!!!! 
-------------------------------------
partie en mode coaching. les commentaires s'adressent principalement à albert260648. le coup le plus souvent joué en réponse à d5. on s'en va vers l'italie ou l'espagne (ouverture italienne ou ouverture espagnole ?). ce coup respecte deux des principes fondamentaux des ouvertures : il attaque un pion dans le centre et développe un pièce mineure (fou ou cavalier). le coup naturel : lui aussi fait deux choses importantes : protège le pion central attaqué et développe une pièce mineure. ce sera l'espagne. l'espagne est beaucoup plus populaire maintenant que l'italie pour les joueurs d'échecs. avec bc4, on serait en italie: l'ouverture italienne était en effet très populaire au début du 20ème siècle. on dirait qu'il faut que les noirs protègent le pion e5 ?! voilà un coup qui protège le pion, en effet, mais qui cloue le cavalier. de toute façon, on retrouve ce clouage du cavalier dans plein d'ouvertures, et ce n'est pas la fin du monde. ce coup est donc tout à fait valable. mais ce n'est pas le coup le plus souvent joué. c'est plutôt a6 qui est joué ici 90% du temps. mais alors, les noirs ne perdent-ils pas le pion e5 après l'échange du fou blanc pour le cavalier noir? pourtant, tous les experts sont d'accord : il n'est pas vraiment bon de prendre le pion. pourquoi? renouvelle la pression au centre. oui, bd7 était meilleur! et voilà pourquoi. les blancs gagnent un pion. mais maintenant, les blancs gagnent une pièce. il fallait jouer a6. ici, les blancs auraient pu jouer bxb, mais ce coup permet de développer la dame. un autre coup qui développe une pièce mineure. rien à redire ici. en prévision d'une avance des pions du côté roi. les noirs envisagent probablement de roquer du côté dame. j'ai joué ce coup malgré les inconvénients que pourraient causer la recapture avec le pion, ouvrant la colonne g pour une tour noire.  en reprenant avec le fou, la position demeure fermée du côté roi, et les chances d'attaque pour les noirs diminuent.  les tours doivent se placer sur des colonnes ouvertes, comme disait confucius. le bon plan, mais les noirs auront de la difficulté à développer une bonne attaque du côté roi pour contrebalancer l'attaque des blancs qui va maintenant débuter du côté dame. échange nécessaire pour placer le cavalier en d5. peut-être un des pires coups que les noirs pouvaient jouer. l'objectif des blancs est d'avancer les pions du côté dame, faire le ménage devant le roi, pour permettre aux tours de s'infiltrer de façon victorieuse dans la chambre du roi. en avançant les pions devant le roi, les noirs facilitent le travail de sape des pions. le contact va simplement se faire plus tôt. da4 était nécessaire pour éviter un mat rapide.

prudence et développement plutôt que de prendre le pion. assez de prudence. on prend.  plutôt que qa4 qui reprend le pion mais laisse la dame blanche dans une position avancée (avec du pour et du contre). comme disait confucius, un pion est un pion. les blancs ont maintenant deux pions isolés. vient à la rescousse du cavalier. les blancs ont réussi à se libérer, mais les noirs vont tenter d'utiliser au maximum la colonne c ouverte. abandonne l'idée d'attaquer le pion a5 mais il fallait regrouper les pièces en particulier le cavalier qui devra passer par b1. un coup d'attente qui peut être utile plus tard en enlevant toute possibilité de mat sur la dernière rangée. en vue du coup suivant. évidemment, pourquoi n'avoir pas joué cela tout de suite au coup précédent. un gars a le droit de changer d'idée. voilà la raison du changement d'idée. l'échange des dames n'est pas si mauvais pour les noirs. ce cavalier va enfin pouvoir être plus utile. nb5 était réfuté par be7. de retour sur la colonne ouverte. sinon, les noirs jouent r(c8)c2. il y a peu de choses que les blancs auraient pu faire pour empêcher de perdre du matériel supplémentaire. un petit coup intermédiaire avant de prendre le pion, pour bloquer la colonne e. tour prend tour n'était pas mieux. les pions passés noirs ne sont pas arrêtables. nécessaire pour placer la tour noire sur une case noire. 
-------------------------------------
this is a strange game i've just played, with a final resignation that i don't understand. king's gambit. accepted. king's knight's gambit. quaade gambit. king's knight's gambit. it was supposed to be a game without ease castling. allgaier gambit. kieseritsky, paulsen defence. forced position of white's knight.  kieseritsky, berlin defence. never played such a game before, ready to learn. i didn't understand this move. it's possible to take pawn on g4 or protect pawn on e4. he prefers to let his bishop free to take f4. i attacked black knight's positon at the same time i protected g4. i took the free pawn. he did the same. i gave options to my bishop. just because of it. i completely refuse to protect my king properly. all or nothing. free to castle. maybe my mistake. he offered me his knight, just for taking mine and getting a great position. if i had accepted, it was lost. i tried to avoid his movement with his knight on f3 or his castle. and he moves his knight to e5 just before... ¿resigning? it was going to be such a difficult game, but so difficult to resing now? 
-------------------------------------
firework start. hard to see sacrifice, but if black goes qe7, 11. nc7+, kf7, 12. nxr. true is that black would have an attacking position after ne5 (trapping the white knight), but probably the master's analysis went much further than mine. leontxo says qb6 could be "the correct one", but not why. the attack on b2 doesn't seem very promising. but white should lose a tempo in order to save the e6 knight, and it is  beyond my ability to say what would happen.   the good point of qb6 is that doesn't give white a tempo to castle. a questionable move, as it leaves the f column to white. true it allows black to play nc5, freeing his lsb, but the black king it too exposed! ...since this king movement is almost forced. white threats qd6 or nxg7+, or maybe nd5. ...but it leaves white the canche to add pressure to the black king.  sad position for a king. black cannot play the knight to the 5º rank because it blocks the profilacting action of the black queen on this row, facilitating white's plans to trap black's king.  leontxo says capablanca could have won with 16. qf7, never mind if black plays qxe3+, 17. kh1, after which indicates g6 as the correct defence for black (white threats g4 - g5# and if nxg4, rh5#). 18. ne6 (threatening mate), rg8, 19. nd5, qxe4, 20. rxnf6, to which black answers with nf8 - losing. it seems a weird move, but...   black cannot take nxrf6 because of 21. nxnf6, threatening the queen and mate in h8, and the rook...  ...and if black plays qxnd5, white goes 21. qxrg8, nxrf6, 22. qg7+, kh5 (forced) and 23. nf4+, winning the queen! ... ne5, and with 21. qxg8 white wins, even if black goes: bxe6, 22. qxe6 (not qxra8, bxn, with a strong attack). ...threatening at once g5#, since black cannot take the pawn (nxg4, rh5#).  ...the best defence? after qxe3+ white is in troubles! black threats perpetual, and to avoid it white must either lose the knight or the pawn (helped by nxe5 if white wants to shield his king with nc-e2), and the pressure over the black's king, losing.  am i right? it seems to me that 17. h4 whorths a look. must black take gxh4, or he can go qxq? if gxh4, 18. g5+, kg8, 19. (say) gxnf6+, nxf6, 20. rg5+, k(say) f8, 21. nf-d5 (e3 must be protected, and with this knight white prevents nxe4), nxn, 22. nxn (with the queen, it allows qxe3+, but it is unclear if that would save black), qxq, and white is just a pawn up, but with a winning position, despite the doubled pawns. i think.... white doesn't have a mate (as far as i can see) 23. rf1+, ke8, 24. re5+, k goes to the queenside and there is no mate in sight.   many other lines are possible after 17. ..., qxq, since hxg5+ is not mate anymore, so kg7, and white must play carefully to avoid lines such as 19. gxnf6, nxf6, threatening the rook and recovering material equality even if white central free pawns must win in the long term.  nxb6 is of course impossible because of rxnf6+. white's attack seems to have lost steam, since the knight must retire. now, main white's advantage are the central free pawns, but he cannot save the g pawn. so capablanca tries to complicate threats.  leontxo says black can win after gxnf4, 19. g5+, kg7, 20. gxf6+, nxf6, 21. rg5+, kf7 (or kh6), 22. exf4, defending the rook, realigning the free pawns, with a winning position, even with a pawn less.  kasparov said 18. ..., ra5 is even better. not clear why to me. the idea is, probably, being able to play rg6 after 19. rd6, gxnf4, but probably white would go for something like nf-d5... or maybe, black dreams with an attack over the white king (but nxg4 was necessary, first...) black thinks he reached a sort of shield so proceed to take away one of the strongest threats over his king. now, it has two squares to go. leontxo says nxn was better, but it is unclear to me how black position would hold after exd5, reassetting the central pawns. nxd5 or rxd5 seem good too! this is mainly to free the 6th row to white's rook, preventing rg6 defence to black. it blocks one of king's save squares... if 21. ..., nf6, 22. rxnf6+, nxr, 23. rxnf6+, kh5, i cannot see a clear victory for white, since 24. nf5, bxn frees black.  white has nice threats with 24. ne2, rxne7, 25. ng3+, and if kh4, 26. rh6+, kg4, 27. kg2! and black cannot stop the mate (h3#).  but, if black goes 25. ..., kg4, 26. kg2. now, if black goes h5, white can go 27. rh5, and black cannot escape from mate (rxh5 / h3, in either order).  so, it seems to be the hidden threat that prevents black to stop the check with the knight.  black must stop the mate in h3. now, the previous sequence starting with rxn doesn't give check to black, so leaves him a tempo to defend.  leontxo says that now rh3+, kg4, kg2 wins, threatening kd1-f2# and rxh7 probably, capablanca was looking for a repetition in order to reach the time control, later... but his opponent went to another move.  black can give the quality in order to release the pressure (g4, 27. nxg6, axg6 and black seems to hold, even if in a losing position: white can try 28. ne2, nxe5, 29. nf4+, that eventually leads white to win the pawns with a better position). leontxo says that if nc5, instead, black could have drawn the game.  leontxo says that now, if hxg6, white goes 28. e5, since nxe5 is not possible due to rxnf6. the same doesn't hold for the previous comment, in which i said that hxg was best.  i cannot see why kh5 is not preferable.  and black resigned, because (leontxo says) of the following moves, that were not played.

another game from my french defence mini tournament. i decided to annotate this one as i felt i played a lot better than i have in many games recently, i'd be interested to see if others agree or not with some of my move choices.   analysis is available - http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=19076547&rnd=0.6846651595551521  in this game the white bishops proved to be a powerful force to be reckoned with.  interestingly, so far in the tournament i have won more games as white than black starting position tarrasch, this is a rare move for me as generally i would go for nc3 but i thought i would give it a try this takes us out of the gameknot database where the moves were nbd7 and qxd4 black looks a little cramped here to me computer thinks this is an innacuracy prefering … nxe4 10. bxe4 qb6 11. rb1 nf6 looking to provoke h3 to weaken the pawns around the black king i think this may be inaccurate as now black can only push my knight out by further weakening the pawns around the king threatening qh3 i have no intention of swapping out my bishop and this also gives my queen more access to squares around the black king i would say this is a blunder as it loses material as we will see. computer calls it a mistake and prefers  nb6 13. g4 f5 followed by a flurry of exchanges computer says this is a mistake preferring  ne5 14. dxe5 bxe6 15. nc5 bd5 16. qh3 qa5 i would prefer bxf8 here as black as the text allows me to play bh6 later hemming the king in. computer calls this a mistake preferring  fxe4 15. qxe4 bxf8 16. qxc6 nb6 threatens bxb5 as the c6 pawn is pinned to the rook my plan now was to try to get my lsb on the a2-g8 diagonal, with hindsight i should probably have played a4 but for some reason i can't recall i didn't.  computer says this is whites first mistake and it prefers  bxb5 qc7 17. bc4+ kh8 18. d5 bf6 i'm happy with this as it lets my plan easier to execute the pawn is still pinned but now to the black lsb. computer calls this a mistake traps the knight my queen can now get to the a1 - h8 diagonal to complete my plan and if black takes my knight on b5 i can take his dsb which weakens black on the dark squares planning to sacrifice the rook with something like rxf5, gxf5 bxf5 which exposes the black king even further and threatens qxh7# i'm not certain this is a blunder but it does lose some material as i'm up in material i am happy to exchange queens, this move was to protect the queening square from the white rook after queens are exchanged i can bring my rook in to support my passed pawn but first i need to neutralise the black knight, i didn't want to exchange as it allowed the black king to get out easier threatening to pin the knight  computer prefers . rd1 rg8 28. rd7 nh5 29. rxa7 rd8 better is surely ba4 computer calls this a blunder preferring h5 and we will see why this was completely unexpected as i was expecting b3 this proved to be a pretty fatal move for black as we will see not that he has a lot of options. computer gives mate in 9 here rb6 32. rd1 h5 33. rd7 kh7 34. bxg7 g5 35. be5+ kg6 36. e7 f4 37. e8=q+ kf5 38. f3 rd6 39. rxd6 g4 40. qxh5# and prefers rf8 i dont need the rook on the e file as the bishops can protect the pawn, with the rook here i have the threat of rd8+, when my pawn gets to e7 this will allow my rook to protect the pawn from blacks rook forced obviously i hadn't seen the mate that the computer had and so this is described as a blunder  too late but black had little choice black is going to lose more material and if the king goes to h7 i have have bg5  computer gives mate in 6 here i completely missed the mate in two here with qg8 +, kh6, qh8# threatens qg8# which ironically is mate in 3 nice fork but it fails however black was out of options thanks for reading i hope you enjoyed the game. please comment

-------------------------------------
my second english as black, second lost,  english opening, i do not like it but it's a reason to work on it. white opts for the fiancheto variation it seems ok for black. i often trade the center pawn. retreat white develops not a too bad position for the knights king in safe. castling as well. white advances on the queen side, black settles in the center. i don't understand this move and i do not like it. preventing 11. b5 or 11. nb5 white developes the center. black's plan is to attack the e and d file but it's a bad move for it weakens black's king. (my opponent thinks it is the losing move and looking at it now, i think he is right.) white carries on developping his pieces with the a2 g8 diagonal open and the king on g 8, trading the bishop is a strategical mistake.  white accepts the trade, of course. that was black's aim : to bring a knight on the center (the brave lancelot was so impatient) lancelot is pined and the white bishop has fallen on battle. only dame guenièvre can protect her faithfull knight. to enable the rook to come on the e file and to prevent 16. nxe5 nxe5 17. bxd4 + it had to come perceval will at least revenge his fellow knight. my opponent doesn't take but the situation is not getting better for black. at this point, i'm asking myself how i have done to be in such a situation after only 16. moves. the footman comes and help his knight. i had foreseen this move but thought, trading one rook against the advanced white knight was not so bad (compared to others possibilities). so, now, lancelot will meet his doom argh... revenge but black's situation is very bad : 4 points late in material. the fact that white has a weak pawn on the d file and that black dominates the center doesn't compensate this late. white proposes a trade trading is not in black's favour, so dame guenièvre has to hide behind perceval. white trades as much as he can and he is definitely right. a counterattack white can afford a couple of mistakes garde ! one less... not a safe place for dame guenièvre but are there still safe places for a lady on this battlefield. of course... protecting the brave perceval. the trade is unavoidable no more queens on the field a last assault from perceval king in great danger. little choice to take a pawn but i should probably have plaid 30. bd4 to keep the center complicated and protect f5. probably perceval's morale was no more sufficient to properly fight. from now on, black tries to avoid the mate and hold 13. moves. it's finished. the king is dead and the faithfull perceval still at his side could do nothing but cry.  
-------------------------------------
a long and tight game.  that was a thematic game, we decided both to explore two openings during a couple of games but the games are rated. english opening . i do not like very much this opening, for it can lead to closed and complex situations with concentration of pièces on the center which i do not like at all. so, i'll try to evitate them. i think that my oponent prefers open games as well but he is far better than me in closed situations, so that he could choose this tactic. on the other hand, we play those game to experiment, so that everything can happen... i opt for a fiancheto variation. after the fiancheto, the center... at this stage my plan is to open the game as much as possible, so that i opt for an aggressive move. black doesn't take and black 3 pièces to protect c5. the queen is in front of mine on the open file, so that he can choose between two options after 8.dxc5 (8. ... dxc5 or 8. ... bxc5)  and they would quickly lead in very complex situations which my opponent likes. although i like them as well, i do not want to let him choose the line... so that... i could not see anything else to do. it seemed me the safest move and i didn't find any efficient attacking plan but i didn't like this move very much for my opponent would be able to block the game in the center which was exactly the opposite of my plan. but black takes. thank you bwaa for having choosen this line. the other candidate move was 9. nxd5 wether fo 9. ... bxd5 or 9. ... nxd5 but black was not obliged to take, for the knight menaces nothing important. so that i prefered to build a strong center by 10. e4 king in safe. white still has the initiative but black's counterattack can come very quickly because black can easily remove the c knight if he can bring his b pawn on b4. at least it was the danger, i felt exposed. i didn't like this situation very much but now i felt i had to protect the d5 pawn and try, so doing, to conserve the center's control, or to improve it, for if having a pawn on the 5th line blocks the opponent, the pawn is hard to defend. now white's weak pawn is the e one. the c knight protect the two pawns and, in this condition is not reliable (even lancelot the brave has his limit.) i didn't expect this move, for i imagined wether 10. ... ba6 or 10. ... re8. and even now, i'm not sure about it, for it lead to a line which went very dangerous for white (at middle term) but also dangerous for black. anyway, the game was very funny and interresting.  it's a drawback move, which at first sight doesn't seem important but which proved to have very big conséquences on the rest of the game at long term. it seemed the obvious move to do : protecting white's e pawn, the weakest piece on the center and settling a rook on the semi open e file. creating a weakness on the kingside. to attack black's d pawn which is the weak one. black counters. trading, for i was sure that black would play13.... dxe6 which would have given me a passed pawn on d. but my opponent takes whith the f pawn, surprising me like he often does. i thought the move weakened to much the king so that black wouldn't dare to play it. of course it's a very offensive position and black will now easily gain the initiative. at this point white changed his plan once again. i have to fully open and take control of the b1g8 diagonal and attack the king this way (bwaa did the same to me two games ago, so that it was ok to show him that i learned the lesson he gave me) i estimated that black's attack on the f file was not that dangerous (wrong estimation). the rook is aimed at c4 where i want to bring my lsb. attack on the queenside and freeing the rook. to prevent nb4 strange knight move. i didn't doubt that my opponent had planned it at least when playing 14. ... na6 and probably before but i couldn't find where it lead and i didn't feel at ease. carrying on the plan : bringing the bishop at c4 but weakening the kingside defense. defending e5 and indirectly, menacing e4 to prevent 17. ... nb5 to menace 18. ... qxf3. 19. qxf3 rxf3. but white has many pieces available to defend f3 the two other candidates moves where 18. be2 or 18. bg2 but both would mobilise the bishop and my plan was still the same. the fact that the black queen was on f7 was still a better reason to carry on the plan : taking control of the a2 g8 diagonal. annoying for white for it  permitted black to attack f3 with one more piece (19. ... bg4) and i would have to mobilise my lsb (19. be2) which would, furthermore block my e rook. now black had definitely the initiative. i judged that i had defensive and counteroffensive possibilities but as white i should have been on attack (i can't play re3 to protect f3 for if 19.e3 bg5 and one of my rooks gets it). i estimated that i could counter 19. ... bg4 by 20. be2 and prefered to counterattack. the knight menaces black's d pawn if 19. ... bg5 and if 19. ... nxb5 20. bxb5 and the c4 square is locked. this move also permits 20. rc3, thus protecting f3. i'm not a defender and if the risk is on both sides, it's okay for me.  the risk is okay as well for my opponent for black prefers to attack than to deal with my knight. so that it was the other reason to have plaid 19. b5. now i do not frighten 21. ... bg5 and i can even play 21. re3  bg5 22. rd3 thus overprotecting f3 without using my lsb. black carries on his plan, blocking the game on the right wing and attacking with all what he cans on the left wing but white has superiority on the center and the black king is weakened so that, if i manage to resist the attack, i could quickly be very dangerous.  first step of a complicated plan to occupate the b1 g8 diagonal and menace the king. to achieve his plan, white has to get rid of d6 and the  only way i found was to sacrifice the f knight by 23. nxe5 dxe5 24.d6 menacing the dsb if 25. ... bxd6 26.  bc4 and white wins the queen. or else black has to move his queen which has little place available and white can play 27. dxe7. but to achieve this plan, white needs to protect f2 from 24. nxe5 qxf3 + so that the f1 knight must let his place to the rook by 21. be2 ... 22. rf1 i resume : 21. be2 ... 22. rf1 (to protect f2) 23. ne5 dxe5 24. d6 ... 25. bc4. of course black will play so that i''d probably need a couple of moves more. it almost worked so with two moves late. it had to come. black's attack on the king side is countered, he tries something else. only place. now black has definitely changed his plan and mobilises for an attack on the queenside. now it's even better for the attack of e5 and it menaces 24. nxb6 which black will surely counter wether by 24. ... bd8 or by 24. ... rb8. giving me one tempo to carry on the plan right. so that white carries on his plan. black sees the danger of 26. ng5, menacing the queen if 25. ... bxb6. but it's not white's plan. "so, my brave knight go and fight in the melee... and die bravely..." almost forced move. white has regained the initiative at the price of one knight. the aim is still the b1 g8 diagonal. 26. ne5 was another candidate move and probably better but i was still aiming at my diagonal. black should probably have moved the queen away from the diagonal. so i've traded one knight against two pawns for if 27. ... bxb6 28. bxc4 and the black queen is captured. of course, black has this counterattack available. only move but black cannot carry on attacking. menacing the b knight. black has saved his rook. only move to protect the b pawn. now, black is one point ahead but has 3 isolated pawns and white has a protected passed pawn. queen and king are still on the same diagonal (on which white couldn't set his bishop despite his efforts). to prevent rxb2 and qa2 black is again on attack. after taking place on the kingside and on the opposite wing, the fight is now on the center. attacking c6 and permitting 32. bc4  black prevents both menaces. white's plan is not the b1 g8 diagonal anylonger. it's to do as much damage as possible on the center as his pièces are well developped and black's one are now cramped. the d pawn is a catterpillar which surely will be eaten by a black bird before transforming in butterfly but he has caused troubled and won't die alone. white is almost obliged to accept the trade in order to conserve the initiative. trading normally advantages the one with the material advantage but in this case, with a far better pawn structure, i estimated that i had good chances in an endgame. now, white has material advantage. material equality but white has a better position due to the pawn structure and the rooks which can be easily doubled. to menace both the b pawn and the knight. black must abandon one more pawn. at this point, another developpement begins. the first melee is over and no pièces will be taken during the next 6 moves of positional chess. during the next 13 move there will be only two pawns taken. black regroups his forces. to liberate the e rook from the "ward of b3" mission. white needs to reorganise his troops as well.  taking control of one open file. securing a knight on the center. black wants to keep control of the d file. to prevent a5. i want to take pawn a6 and it's easier if it stays on a white square.  of course, it implies to have a pawn on a black square undefendable by his knight. but white has the advantage now and an exchange wouldn't be so bad. black takes control of the center and is on attack again. to menace a6 and stay on the open file. a good place for the knight. weakening the kingside but aiming at the center. i judged that if black set his bishop on d4, i could simply move my king on a light square. doubling the rooks on the open file. white is getting slowly a good offensive position. to bring the bishop on d4. now, the pièces seem to be ready and white has a plan to attack the king. it had to come the king is not very safe but he can hide on h3 and it will be hard for black to attack him. i think that it's at this stage that black proposed a draw, which white refused. material equality. i suppose that black planned 45. nd3 and the 3 black pièces grouped can be very dangerous when working together so that white had better to pay attention. white follows his plan : i saw 3 possible lines : one was to attack the king by bringing the knight on e7 (it would take at least 3 moves). the other one was to take black's a pawn and advance white's one, forcing an exchange against a rook. the third one was the mating menace by 46. re8 rxe8 47. rxe8 but black was not obliged to trade the rooks so white has to force the exchange. black attacks but his a pawn is now unprotected. the 2 rooks have to stay on the e file and there are few places. to attack the knight. menacing nd7 to force the black rook to move. to block the e file by ne3  menacing to take the rook. attacking the king but more important disjoining the rooks on the e file. safe place. chasing the knight if 50. ... rxd7 51. ra8+ rb8 52. rxb8 rd8 53. rxd8 # only move to chase the knight. if 51. ... bxe5 52.rxe3 menacing the knight. 53. re6 menacing mate withe the 2 rooks joined on the e file. to protect the c pawn. when playing this move, it seemed ok because it allowed a threat of mate by having both rooks on the a file and it permitted 53. a6 ... 54. nc6. but it also enable a far better moves, which i think unavoidable for black but i didn't see it at first. my opponent said he had little time to think about this move and hoped he wouldn't regret it and there i finally saw the move to make. ! if 53. ... nxc4 54. re8+ rxe8 55. rxe8# black had little else to do. to menace the lsb and quit the e file. to keep the control of the b1 h7 diagonal and not being harassed by the king. now, white's plan is to send the black king back again in his corner and give the mate using he a pawn. only move now, the black king is blocked again if 59. ... rxa5 60. re8+ mate black must keep his rook onthe 8 line to force the black king to go to g8 if 60. ... ke8 61.ra7+ ... 62. rxa8 to oblige the black king to go on h8 (so that it cannot escape) no choice to attack d4 and, more important, to control a7 were the a pawn has to go. now, advance the a pawn black hopes a blunder (which can happen). if 65. ... c2 66. bxc2 kxr now, thereis a forced mate in 3. classical attack with rook and pawn against rook. black fights till the very end. mate in one the queen is not dangerous on this square for it cannot attain the 8 line in one move.

the first white’s move prevents to black e5. if black wants to occupy e5 must first prepare the drive (it’s ok also d5 or c5 natural follow-up of the english game the bishop on g2 exerts pressure on the squares e4 and d5 this is the third consecutive move of the black pawn. it 'a bit' risky and not advised to move a lot of pawns at the beginning, better is to try to develop the pieces. in this case it is not an error, in fact, the pawn f5 increases the weight at the center and attacks c4 white seeking control of the central squares d5 and in particular d5 a natural response to capture the white’s ambitious move that seeks to put pressure on the side of the black queen be7 would have been better. black has moved twice the same piece just to annoy the white knight, freeing up the diagonal for the white bishop is the fifth move of the black pawn. at this point he should have realized the risk and prefer to release the side of king with … qxd5 black allows to white the best variations this advance makes difficult to move kb8   black tries to dub the white pawns forced white contrasts the move on the rook with a useful developing move black threatens mate in one move, but white can avoid it with gain of time white realizes the black’s plans normally is not wise to play aggressive moves with the queen  in the first stage of the game because, when she is opposed, is squeezed and causes loss of time the bishop occupies the weakened diagonal the pressure on g7 becomes dangerous. the white, playing bf1, he discovers the tower and wins time a weak defense of g7 white starts the attack white defends the bishop the final attack begins was also excellent bf1 this attack, long awaited, is decisive. after bc4, the two bishops, are aimed at parallel diagonals and send the defenses of the black in panic  a desperation’s move?) in exchange for the queen, black has got two minor pieces and a pawn that could help him to keep playing. but you remember my note about the developmental delay of the pieces? the white look for the simplest solution to make a final with higher pieces quality now black has to give a piece after 21…. h6 22. rg8+ kh7 23. rxc8, black, as well losing in quality, is nailed on the last line black avoids the checkmate on g8, but his situation is hopeless black can’t save f5 black tries to save e4 (the white menace 26.rh3, after  25…rg8 26.rxg8+ kxg8 27.rg1+ kh8, the game is over) 1-0  
-------------------------------------
baadur is well-known as a very creative and sharp chess player. therefore, my plan for the game was to play solid chess and stay away from complications, which is probably baadur's strongest side. by move 10, it was clear that something went wrong.. the first interesting moment, already on the second move. baadur periodically plays the budapest gambit, but that day i did not want to see it on the board. the first four moves i tried to play some solid chess, but then had to fight to get my pawn back. ?! a well-known line, which has a reputation of being dubious. even though i thought that knew the refutation, (as i had played a similar game a few years earlier) it turned out that things are not so simple. 5...bf5 is the main line. ! the most principled answer and i believe that the strongest one. ! the point of bg4 line.  now both captures lead to a good position for black, so white has to come up with something stronger. 11...nxe5 12.nxe5 qxe5 13.g4 bg6 14.f4 qf6 15.f5 qh4+ 16.kd2! and white is clearly better as in my chess game against ipatov, but black did not get enough compensation for the bishop. i was satisfied with my chess position since i knew that bxd6 is losing for black and i could not believe that ke7 can be actually playable. ! frankly, at first i was sure that the game would not last more than 10 more moves with such a king on e7 and a powerful knight in the attack. i had a feeling that the checkmate was not far away. .but the more i was thinking about the position, the more clearly i was realizing that there was no checkmate. moreover, black has his own active counterplay. things got tricky, so for the next move i spent about 30 minutes. if 12...bxd6 13.qxd6 qxh1 white wins after 14.bg5 f6 15.exf6 gxf6 16.qe6+ kf8 (16...kd8 17.bxf6++–) 17.bh6 checkmate! the position looks kind of wild, but actually the next several moves are more or less forced for both sides. the toughest part was to find the upcoming rg1 idea followed by nd5, otherwise qb3 would be just bad. ! it's not every day you see both queens get almost to the corner of the board to hunt the rooks. not to mention that f6 is not the most common square for black's king with a full board of pieces. now rg1 with the idea of be2 looks very strong however, unfortunately, my queen is also getting trapped, even though that was not so clear from this position, considering that my queen has a number of squares to go right now. if 14...kxd6 then simply 15.rg1. ! ?! oops, it turns out that the white queen has no squares to retreat to, since 18. qb4 runs into 18…nd3+. but, here comes the help from the knight, which had to be foreseen in advance. due to the fact that my next move white saves the queen, 17…bf3 deserved serious attention. then after 18.qb3 nc5 19.qc2 g6! i am not sure how to evaluate the position, but i have a feeling that black's play should be a bit easier as its pieces are much more active and the king hides well on g7. ! ! here a new stage of the game begins. with an extra queen, objectively white's position is close to winning. however, it is very easy to make a mistake. ?  i don't think i spent more than a minute on this move, but the computer shows a crazy balancing act of white's king with 25.ke1! nf3+ 26.kf2 rc2+ 27.kf1 nh2+ 28.ke1 nf3+ 29.kd1 and white should win. i can't say that i felt very comfortable with the king on h4, but as we say in russia: “if you are afraid of wolves, don’t go to the woods”. so i began to look for the ways to escape with the king without losing the queen or rooks along the way. ? a serious mistake, which allows white's king to run away. much stronger was 30...bd7! 31.kg5 rh6!, getting the last piece into play. for those who are interested, you can turn on the engine and see that its evaluation is as usual: triple zero. that means it is a forced draw somehow. but, from the human's point of view, the position is far from being clear and all three results are possible. !  i would love to confirm the myth of my extraordinary calculating chess abilities, but unfortunately i simply overlooked this move and its powerful threat of g7-g5 checkmate. so i began to frantically look for a perpetual check which i failed to find...the whole game flashed in my head, and it felt so disappointing to lose the game after such a heroic king escape.. thus, the combination with a queen sacrifice which led to the endgame with a big advantage for white was born out of desperation. ! ! white wins one of the pieces and gets the endgame with a good winning chances. baadur did not defend the best way, but i can understand his disappointment, when instead of a mating attack he had to fight for a draw in an unpleasant chess endgame.  
-------------------------------------
all standard enough. !?   the evans gambit.   probably objectively not sound, but at the board, what a computer thinks is often irrelevant. i think black is usually best served accepting the gambit; if the bishop goes to b6, it can end up shut in completely after a c3 and d4 push. however, now white gets in c3 with tempo. the point of the evans gambit.   white, for the sac of a pawn, stakes a large claim in the centre.   black's dsb, meanwhile, isn't really in the game. i think this may be the main line.   f7 is under threat.   black, however, could at some stage take on c3 with discovered check threats. ?  7. … qe7 or qf6 is called for here, to defend f7.   d5 ideas aren’t uncommon in some gambit lines (like the bertin gambit in the king’s gambit); the idea is to give back some of the material gained to develop quicker.   it doesn’t really work here though; it’s basically a free pawn, and with the knight on c6, it’s doubly dangerous for black. !?   probably better than bxp; the knight is going to get kicked to an awkward square, and the threats against f7 haven't gone away. this looks natural – the king must move, forfeiting castling rights (9. be2 is met with d3, winning the pinned piece).   in actual fact, it’s the start of quite a ride for black! there was a debate after the game as to the best square for the king here - safety on f1 followed by developing while hitting the queen with ba3, nd2 and re1, or this move, allowing the immediate threat of re1 in addition to the problem of the hanging knight.   after a minute’s thought, fritz rates kf1 0.17 better, but white has a clear advantage here either way (+3 or so). a blunder.   after 10. nxn, the white knight is immune from capture due to the re1 pin.   best here was 10. dxc, says fritz. looks like it wins a piece, but doesn't because... now the queen can capture the knight, and re1 doesn't work.   so instead... ! protects the knight, opens up a line for the bishop onto the weak f7 square, threatens to take the bishop on a5 and hits the queen.   what more can you ask of one move? a desperate spite check; anything to get some pieces developed. !   again, the strongest.   black’s checks are going nowhere, and the knight is in too fine an attacking position to consider wasting time capturing the worthless black bishop.   white is after black's king, and isn't about to be distracted. the king is quite safe here. ?? an unfortunate way to end a nice miniature, though black was lost anyway. black must get out of check, and white can save his own queen.   black was lost anyway - if instead 14. ... qe6 or qh4, there follows 15. nxp+ kc8   16. qe8+ qd8   17. qxq#   if 14. ... qxp, nxf7 is a nice family fork - queen, king and rook.   14. ... pxp is probably best, but white can play 15. nxf7+, and both black bishops are going to fall, depending on where black moves his king. 
-------------------------------------
hi everyone!  in this unrated game my opponent launches a kingside mating attack which included a speculative exchange sacrifice.  somehow i managed to beat this one off and later on in the game i returned the compliment.  but which player triumphed?  well, read on and see.  i start this game with my now usual reti opening 1.nf3. 3. nc3 - development. 4. ...…. nxd5 - pawn trade. 6. qh4 - glenda is waiting to welcome the bk should he go kingside. 8. bh6 - threatening the usual fianchetto bishop trade off to weaken the black squares on the kingside. 12. ……. nxc6 - bishop trade. 15. 0-0 - both players castle on opposite sides.  this usually means a kingside/queenside mating attack race.   16. ……. qxd5 - knight trade. 18. qxg5 - bishop trade. 18. …… f5 - declines queen trade. 20. qxg5 - ella offers a pawn and glenda zaps it.  but is it a mistake?  we shall see. 21. ….. rg4 - preparing to double. 23. g3 - now henry is starting to feel a little draughty.  thank heaven ella's light square bishop is off the board.  queen ella would certainly be much more of a threat than she is now. 24. ……. qf3 - queen ella comes further in but glenda also has ideas of gatecrashing black's position. 25. ….. nd8 - the only way to avoid losing a second pawn (e6). 27. nf4 - threatening nxe6. 28. …… rg4 - declines queen trade. 29. ….. rxg3+ here is ella's rook sacrifice. 31. ….. qxe3 - queen ella mercilessly zaps my pawns. 32. ….. qxd4 - queen ella does not zap glenda and instead zaps yet another white pawn. 34. rg1 - threatening rg8+ 36. rxc6 - here is my exchange sac and this prompts an immediate resignation on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as if ella accepts it, glenda will take on c6 threatening both qa8# and qxe8+ qd8, qxd8#.  this is now my third expert victory - what a twist! 
-------------------------------------
una sconfitta ignominosa... ma interessante l'apertura. ho voluto variare il mio schema abituale, con c6, ma ... questa � un'apertura che non conosco ancora bene, la tartakower, se non sbaglio... sempre difficile per me con le bianche.  come sempre, vado sull'aggressivo. il db dava come inferiore per il bianco questa linea, ma non avevo visto nessuno che giocasse la prossima come me, quindi ho voluto provare. ecco cosa succede a non avere i libri delle aperture.  ed eccoci nella classica posizione ipercomplicata, con mille varianti, che non so analizzare.  questa era necessaria, per non dover ritirare il cavallo. avevo visto c5xd4, naturalmente, ma non tutte le sue implicazioni.  se prendo di cavallo, perdo b2. sarebbe stato meglio che perdere un pezzo... mi minaccia g2, gi� che ci siamo.  ...e devo perdere un pezzo. cerco di sfruttare tutto quello che posso, ma non c'� niente da fare. l'unica era ce5, e non so perch� non l'ho vista... la partita � finita! comunque, anche dopo ce5, de6, e non mi resta che dxa7, che comunque no � una buona posizione. meglio comunque della seguente...  
-------------------------------------
following a nice plan in a carlsbad pawn structure, helped me to get a couple of pawns material advantage, then some unfortunate piece placement by black allowed to increase the advantage and even exchange a queen for two rooks into a won endgame, black still tried some perpetual after a nice quiet move 31...g5 to open the h7-b1 diagonal, if my rook abandons the 1st rank, then black's queen would give check either on b1 or h7 and i could have had done nothing to prevent it, finally black blundered and allowed white to control h7 preventing the referred perpetual  queen's gambit declined, exchange, saemisch variation so now we have a carlsbad pawn structure white allows black's light squares bishop more freedom than he would usually has in the queen’s gambit declined, but in return, white fixes the central pawn structure, has a half-open c-file, and a pawn-majority in the centre. from now on white has three possible plans for the middlegame:  a) castle queenside and attack black’s king by means of a pawn-storm b) make use of the central pawn majority, with bd3, qc2 and nge2 c) make a minority attack by the advance of the b pawn hoping to create weaknesses in black's queen side  black on the other side has some counter-play in form of a minority attack on king side with the pawn push f5-f4, or exploit white weaknesses on c4 and e4  i'll try "plan b", with an eye for a possible  swindle back to "plan a" now nge2? would be a mistake, qc2 is needed to hold e4 and threat h7 trying to use the central pawn majority, is a thematic approach to this carlsbad pawns structure games, nge2 instead of nf3, allows some freedom to white's f pawn while still developing his last minor piece castle for safety and to connect the rooks another mistake, this move is only viable if white doesn't play qc2, now black will lose a pawn, to increase white's pawn majority in the centre keeping the pieces on board giving up the bishop pair for a pawn and a strong pawn majority on the centre of the board an interesting novelty, already tried were bf6 and qa5, both moves lead to wins by white, black has a bishop pair and is playing a solid move developing his last piece to were it controls c4 to support the d pawn push if ever needed, also leaves the c column for the a rook, nc3 will follow... pointless, bg3 also controls the h2-b8 column, and ng3 wasn't an option i prefer nc3 after 15.bd5 now 18.nc3 wins a tempo and regains control over e4 only move now two ideas for white to get back a bishop for a knight depriving black of his bishop pair, although not my preferential bishop as we would end up with opposit colours bishops, and to play nd6 forking the rook and b7 black opts to keep both bishops on board so again "plan b" now i expect re7 nf5 with another fork this time on bishop and rook the idea must be qxb2 but b2 is tactically protected, by the move qdb1(!) which wins the queen  again the threat to exchange the knight by a bishop, now with two pawns advantage hitting both c6 and the square c5 this move by black gave me some ideas: is maybe possible to consolidate the position and try then the clearance of the c column to play bc7 with a fork on rook and queen  first step of the wanted consolidation to open an escape from back rank mate to my king i expected gxh4, but now i can at least win a pawn inviting black to exchange his rooks for my queen, or to play re6 and lose yet another pawn with no compensation a zwischenzug to force the pin of the bishop which guarantees white's advantage and now the second rook doubling rooks on c column protects the c8 rook and threats to bring the final rook in to the fight ! nice quiet move to try some perpetual shifting the queen between b1 and h7 opens c8 for the c1 rook with tempo i didn't see this coming until g5,  now the c1 rook is tied to the defence of the back rank, so its a virtual b+r vs q endgame, as black also has the bishop pinned... the idea behind this move is to get to d6 with the bishop ? bad as it allows white to win the bishop be5+ kg8 bd6 ...bxd6 or be5+ f6 to block the bishop check rc7 and now black doesn't have any perpetual as the c7 rook controls h7 and the bishop falls

the voting started right here.  supersparksky: ok guys, it's our move! any suggestions?  archduke_piccolo: accept... ... the counter-gambit: 3.exd5.  i find that gm magnus carlsen was playing king's gambits ten years or so ago.  thewrongreason: that's also my vote.  archduke_piccolo: move 4... i suggest (and vote for) 4.d3, here, forcing the exchange of black's advanced pawn. this is the 'standard' move in this line. one could play 4.nc3, developing a piece, and i won't object if the vote goes that way. but the qp advance also goes to development, as after the pawn exchange, all white's minor pieces will be free to move.  it is extremely unlikely that black will play 4...qxd5, as then, 5.nc3 will attack the queen, and pick up the e-pawn with the knight. in that case white will have a lead in development, and much the greater hold on the centre. supersparksky: ok guys black plays 4....nf6 suggestions with analysis welcome!  redfoxrising: 5. nc3 development on q side, she has 2 open bishops and can castle 0-0 quickly. does anyone see a line for us to get castled?  supersparksky: i feel we need to remove her e-pawn now before it becomes a nuisance this also undoubles our pawns on the d-file and reduces her threat with ...bg4.  redfoxrising: i'll agree to 5 pxe4.  archduke_piccolo: ditto... the purpose of the move to d3 was to exchange off the black e-pawn, so let's have at it.  thewrongreason: i'm glad to participate, ron. the main reason is because ion's involved. having said that, i would agree with ron's assessment with 5.nc3. if it weren't for the votes, and i had this position, this is what i would play as white. but, because of why ion voted for the previous move which was to exchange, the only way we can do this is with 5.dxe4, so that is also my vote. archduke_piccolo: a couple of goodish moves here. a] 6.nf3 - the 'natural' move;  this move obviates any shenanigans arising from 6...qh4ch (though we can look at the consequences of that anon). a likely continuation is:  6.nf3 bc5 (placing pressure on f2) 7.qe2 bf5 displacing the king by 7...bxf2ch seems a bit risky playable on account of 8.kd1 f5 9.nd2 bc5 10.nxe4 fxe4 11.qxe4ch ... and white emerges from the ruck with two extra pawns. if instead 8...qxd5, then white plays the king's knight to d2: 9.nfd2! f5 10.nc3 qd4 11.nxe4 ... with a pretty tactical sort of game ensuing.  8.nc3 qe7 9.be3 ... looks ok for white.   b] 6.be3 - a provocative move. this might be fun: 6...qh4ch 7.g3 nxg3 8.nf3 ... now black has two options, here:  b1] 8...qe7 9.hxg3 qxe3ch 10.qe2 ... after which, one way or another the queens come off, and (in my view) white is left with the more active position .  b2] 8...qh5 (this looks like fun...) 9.hxg3 qxh1 10.qe2 bh3 11.nbd2 bxf1 12.nxf1 ... for the exchange, white has a very active looking position, with all sorts of interesting chances.  i'm going to vote for 6.be3, but i won't complain if the team prefers 6.nf3.  redfoxrising: team vote option 6.nf3 i'm voting for 6. nf3 as this option is the least complicated and most natural move. the move 6.be3 is explained well and it may come up by move 9 in ion's projection. i want our next move to be considered by joe that both moves are goodish and that ion is not going to complain if we op for the natural move. conversely i'm interested in what dave's suggested vote might be. i'm ok with what ever the vote is. as i see it, the 2 choices are both acceptable to avoid qh4+.  thewrongreason: so, i was looking at this. and, in most cases, i'd prefer 6.nf3, but this is how i learn, which ion's familiar with. so, i had to play through, ion's variations. i had a little bit of a difficult time fully understanding the 6.nf3 variation. the reason being is that after 6.nf3 bc5 7.qe2 7...bxf2 is not playable because a capture cannot be made on f2. 7...bf5 is, but after 8.nc3 qe7 9.be3, i don't know where else we'd go or what it will lead to. ion did say it would be ok, but there's more variations to play with, after 9.be3. i see where that would go and how, we might even end up with a small advantage. that is why i'm going to vote for 6.be3.  redfoxrising: after a goods nights sleep it was refreshing to review the options for our next move 6 are still on the table and i stay with my vote. ion thanks for the clarity you provided. i'm still looking at xg3 followed by qxe3+. i'm posting now, but will still review more.  supersparksky: @ ion i have studied your analysis on our position and still feel our best option is main line 6.nf3, after your line 6.be3 i don't feel black will reply qh5+ but more likely to reply 6...be7. with a view to early castling. redfoxrising: 7. qe2 need to combat the threats to the f2 square 7. qe2 is my suggested vote.  supersparksky: 7.qe2 7.qe2 is our only move  redfoxrising: i agree we should discuss our next moves... qe2 and then what ifs moves she makes.   looking at future moves... 7.qe2 bf5  8.be3 or another move... o-o she could castle not so sure that we should castle 0-0-0. we might be able to castle 0-0. if we get our lsb out.  archduke_piccolo: 7.qe2 bf5 i suggest build up against e4 by  8.nfd2.  why the king's knight instead of the queen's? we want the other knight to go to c3 when (if?) black plays 8...qxd4. to be sure, black will want to play ...bf2ch, but that's fine. off to d1 our king goes.  the line, in summary: 7.qe2 bf5 8.nfd2 bf2ch 9.kd1 qxd5 10.nc3  thewrongreason: if i had this position and were white, i'd answer with 7.bd3, and when the n would retreat, i'd then castle. but, i agree with the others for a completely different reason. so, my vote is 7.qe2, simply because it pins her ne4 with a not so easy way out.  supersparksky: continue with main line 8.nc3  redfoxrising: i agree 8. nc3 is my vote to continue.  thewrongreason: i also concur and vote for 8.nc3 thewrongreason: i'm not sure what the best move is. but, my vote, for now, is 9.qb5+ which appears to win the b7 pawn, unless it's poisoned. my thinking is that, if it's not, it'll be difficult for janet to keep her ra8 protected. then, again, there's something i might be missing which could make it unsound. but, what's going through my mind is what damage we might be able to cause for janet.  archduke_piccolo: just about... ... the only thing that's played here is 9.be3.  the idea is to obviate further threats against f2. the justification is 9...nxc3 10.bxc4 nxe2 bxe7.  so i'll be voting 9.be3.  thewrongreason: in that case, i change my vote to 9.be3  redfoxrising: as previously discussed move 9. my vote for 9 is be3.  archduke_piccolo: the problem... ... with 9.qb5ch is that 9...c6 is such a strong reply. the pawn at b7 gets protection from the queen at e7, and white's queen is under attack. and 10.dxc6 would not be possible on account of 10...nxc3ch, winning the queen. the queen would have to go back to e2. i seems that 9...nd7 would also be strong, as after 10.qxb7?? ...nd7ch or ...nc6ch is curtains for white. thewrongreason: this is different then what ion mentioned in the variations, since it would be if janet took with the n, instead. and, if she did, i would've still voted for 10.nxe4 since he discussed. but, because the capture was different then i anticipated, i vote for 10.qxe3. of course, this would likely change, if ion thinks that we should play something different. redfoxrising: my thoughts trade q's  10.qxe7+ kxe7 11.bxc3  supersparksky: 11.qxe7 is our only feasible move!  thewrongreason: it appears that we also have 11.qe5 because of our nf3. but, i like 11.qxe7+ the best since janet will lose her right to castle. so, taking there is also my vote. and, i agree with ron's variation when she recaptures.  supersparksky: @jkarp if we play 11.qe5??..qxe5+ 12.nxe5..nxd5 and we are a piece down!  thewrongreason: yeah. i overlooked 12...nxd5 exchanging is all we can do, anyhow.  redfoxrising: 12. bxc3 taking the minor piece  thewrongreason: i agree with ron. taking back on c3 is our only move. it's then a question of what we'll be able to do with the doubled pawns, later on. but, for me, nothing else comes into consideration, besides, 12.bxc3, so that's my vote. thewrongreason: my vote is for 13.be2 even if we don't play that, i think that getting our bf1 into play is very important. as, i think that we should focus on castling short. then, we can focus on something like re1 later on, where the r will be in a dangerous spot.  redfoxrising: few ideas bc4 protects pd5  to allow castling....  ------------------------------------  ne5 to attack the center for a better outpost position kd6 unlikely but … then nxf7 ch ne5 then i suspect her to reply nd7 opposed to na6 on the rim.  --------------------------------------  kd2 gets us closer to linking our rooks if we decide not to castle, and immediately attacks the lsb limiting it relocate to a4,e4,f5,g6.  supersparksky: 13.kd2 for me queens are off so best position for kings are centre board  thewrongreason: i generally wouldn't want to play something like this since it's not quite an endgame yet. and, we haven't castled. but, i change my vote to 13.kd2 because of what dave just posted.  redfoxrising: i agree with 13 kd2 my vote will be 13. kd2 thewrongreason: unless dave thinks otherwise, my vote for now is 14.bd3. i feel that our bf1 is less then active then janets bf5 since we're undeveloped. so, my idea behind this move is to exchange, which i feel would benefit us.  redfoxrising: move 14 suggestions few move suggestions...  ke3 stay move up as our queens are off the board!  bd3 as joe suggested will link our rooks then get then to open files. not sure if exchanging is a benefit to us at this point, might lead to a draw.  ne5 to get a better outpost  supersparksky: lets take charge of the e-file first, 14.re1+  archduke_piccolo: i'm easy... ... except that i'd rather keep the bishops on. so i'm not keen on 14.bd3, though it is quite playable.  14.re1ch kf6 (say) 15.ne5 looks ok for white. but i'd be happy enough with 14.nd4 or bc4. even be2 has its points.  thewrongreason: well, i like to agree with ion, but i would not object to 14.re1+ due to what dave mentioned. by, i change my vote to 14.bd3 redfoxrising: i'll support 14. re1ch go for the e-file my vote 14. re1ch  thewrongreason: wait, i misread, ion didn't say 14.bd3, actually. he said, 14.nd4 or 14.bc4. and, of those 2 moves, i'd say 14.nd4 which is my vote. if i didn't see the point, i'd agree with re1ch, but bringing the n to d4 attacks the b. but, having said that, the only other move i'd take into consideration would be checking on e1. my real question is where do we go after checking with the r? redfoxrising: 15. bc4 lost my suggested votes so instead of 4 ideas i'll go with 15. bc4 to get our lsb protecting our pawns and linking our r's  i was looking at a mess from playing 15. ke3 re8 ch it put us in and i thought we might get mated while going thru the analysis of the board. that did not happen but i was just making sure.  thewrongreason: i like what we played, but i usually go by what ion said. i considered dave's suggestion but just didn't see where we would go, afterwards. having said, i'm thinking about what to do right now. and, i like the idea of 15.nd4, actually. but, i'm going to agree with ron here, so my vote is for 15.bc4 simply to complete our development. that might change, if ion or dave come up with another suggestion.  supersparksky: how about 15.ne5...  redfoxrising: i'll go with 15. ne5 as well  archduke_piccolo: yes. i like 15.ne5 as well. but i would have no mortal objection to 15.bc4.  redfoxrising: both are decent moves with that said and joes comments looks like we should make our move.  supersparksky: my suggestion is now 16.h3  archduke_piccolo: quantifiable advantage... at the moment white has imposed a bind on the q-side, unless black is prepared to risk minor piece exchanges on a6. but it's not easy to find a positive plan. the suggestion by supersparksky offers the possibility of a general advance on the k-side, with, of course, suitable preparation: h3, bc4, g4 is the basic idea, i think.  i'll go with 16.h3.  thewrongreason: it's something that i don't understand with that operation. and, it's a similar position to what i saw in charles annotation with his draw against the master. but, with that comes my vote for 16.h3 for the reason that the other 2 mentioned.  redfoxrising: 16. h3 for sure!!! supersparksky: i propose we play 17.d6  redfoxrising: can someone do some analysis? c4 d6 anything else?  thewrongreason: i was wondering that to, ron. and, for me, that's a good thing because asking for analysis means that your lost. when i get lost, it means that i'd already be lost, if this were not a consultation game, and i was playing the game. anyhow, i am also going to vote for 17.d6  archduke_piccolo: after looking at... ... 17.c4 and 17.bc4, i'm beginning to like the look of 17.d6! though it looks vulnerable at first sight, it is more robust than it appears. e.g., if black tries 17...re8, we have 18.g4.  17.d6 rd8!? 18.g4 rxd6ch 19.kc1 be6 (not wanting to open the h-file) 20.f5 bxa2 alternatively, 19...be6, 20.rg1.  20.rh2 bb3 (say) 21.rb2 rd1ch 22.rxd1 bxd1 23.kxd1 kxe5 24.rxb7 ... and white still looks to have something of a bind on the q-side.  is black likely to seek an alternative? probably  17...nd7!? 18.bc4 ... (exchanging knights looks good for black) 18...nb6 19.bb3 rhd8 and we can choose from 19...nxf7 or 19...gxh5 (19...g5 doesn't seem to give us much)  i'll cast my vote for... 17.d6.  redfoxrising: i'll support 17. d6  supersparksky: 18.g4 is my sugestion  archduke_piccolo: seconded... 18.g4 was what i reckoned as well. see possible line in my posting 21 apr 20, 15:02.  thewrongreason: 18.g4 is also my vote.  redfoxrising: 18. g4 as well as line shown above redfoxrising: 19. kc1 as discussed is my vote brigadecommander: black is in deep trouble.well played  thewrongreason: as i know by myself, i have little experience. and, i would already be mated as white, if i were playing this side since it was at professional level. so, with what janet posted, combined with, what i saw in a game with ta, and what i studied with coach stockel, i'm going to vote for 20.g5+. as it shows how important pawn chains are, as they are well connected, as opposed to, isolated. but, my vote, of course, will change if ion or dave think that we should do something else.  archduke_piccolo: two options... 20.f5 and 20.rg1.  i don't go for 20.g5, as that tends to give the black bishop some squares - especially f5. i think i'd rather keep control of that square, or, if we are to let it go, play 20.gxh5 instead. but i think we can do better than either.  20.rg1 is unexceptionable, and if others prefer that move, i won't object.  but i'm going to plug for 20.f5. i've actually run through the likely continuation before:  20.f5 bxa2 black is not blessed with an overabundance of choice, here. neither retreat moves look enticing; ...bd5 wouold be met by 21.c4. so...  21.rh2 ... mobilizing the rook with tempo. now, if 21...bd5, 22.c4 seems to win us the bishop, so...  21...bb3 22.rb2 ... a skewer on the b7-square.  22...rd1ch a spectacular method of forcing exchanges to save the bishop. instead, ...ba4 takes the bishop off the a2-g8 diagonal, whereat 23.rxb7 gains a tempo, od white might consider 23.bc4.  23.rxd1 bxd1 24.kxd1 kxe5 25.rxb7 ...  in this position, white is for the moment a pawn down, but has a bind on the q-side. this can be broken, but only at the cost of black's k-side being annihilated.  i think this line offers promising chances.  thewrongreason: that also appears to have a better pawn connection. and, that's without going through enough variations. so, i'll change my vote to 20.f5  redfoxrising: my vote is 20. f5  thewrongreason: complicated position which will make it great for sleeping tonight. i would've voted to exchange lsb's, but i don't think it's a great idea. with me getting to the lost, or what someone once called the boring moment, i'll vote to complete our fianchetto with 21.bg2. as that way, we can also get our rh1 into action which i think will later be dangerous for the monarch.  archduke_piccolo: well... 21.bc4, as suggested joe tentatively suggests could be worth a look. it does force off the bishops-  21.bc4 bxc4 22.nxc4 rd8 i think this rook retreat might be forced, to prevent 23.re8, but what then for white? i keep looking at pawn sacs for a k-side attack, but there doesn't seem to be the weight. otherwise, i can't yet find a follow-up.  against that, we would quite like to see our bishop settle on c4 - and survive the hazards. that means that bg2 is contra-indicated. it also means forcing the enemy bishop from the a2-g8 diagonal. at the same time let's get our most idle piece, the h1-rook into motion:  21.rh2 ... attacks the bishop on a2, which will have to move. 21...bb3 is the likeliest, as black won't feel too chuffed about 21...bd5 22.c4. and after...  21...bb3 ...let's thump it again:  22.rb2. after this, black can force a series of exchanges, but we get to equalise the material, and in the ending have the bishop vs knight on an open board, with the more active pieces besides.  my vote: 21.rh2.  thewrongreason: i change my vote to 21.rh2, and it's not just because it's ion votes. i like the idea of 21.rh2 since b is attacked, and i'd love to get material back.  supersparksky: 21.rh2 looks good to me!  redfoxrising: i vote for 21.rh2 thanks for analysis by ion! redfoxrising: 22. rhb2 is my vote  archduke_piccolo: seconded. skewers the b7-pawn. thewrongreason: my vote is for our only legal move, 22.rxd1. although, i forgot, but it should be a good thing because of what ion noted a couple of moves back.  archduke_piccolo: only move... ... 23.rxd1  i don't think black had any good alternative to the coming exchanges.  redfoxrising: 23. rxd1 is all that can be played redfoxrising: 24. kxd1 kxe5  25.rxb7  thewrongreason: unless the other commentators think otherwise, i will also vote for 24.kxd1.  archduke_piccolo: there is... ... an alternative in 24.nxf7, but i don't think that it gives us much:  1. nxf7 bf3 2. rxb7 hxg4 3. hxg4 bxg4 4. nd6 ke5! not 4...bxf5?? as then 5.ne8ch will win material for white. but white would have to move the knight somewhere: [a] 6.nc4ch kf6, or [b] 6.ne8 nd7 both lines seem to hold for black.  so i'll vote for 24.kxd1.  redfoxrising: 25. rxd1 is still my suggestion  thewrongreason: despite how little experience i have, in the position that janet showed, 25.rxd1 isn't feasible. i think you meant 25.rxb7, ron, which would also be my vote.  redfoxrising: correct thanks joe that was our last move 25. rxb7 is what i meant! thewrongreason: very difficult since we have isolated pawns. i like the idea of 26.h4 to advance our pawn. unless ion or dave thinks otherwise, i'm going to vote for 26.hxg4. as it does prevent loss of material. but, more importantly, despite inexperience, i'm absolutely thinking about gm susan polgar noted which is that it's better to have the pawns connected, as opposed to, isolated. if we recapture on g4, that will happen. and, although it's extremely unlikely, i believe that there's a slight possibility, in the long run, much later on, that this will give us a passed pawn if we take back.  redfoxrising: 26. rxf7 looks the best choice  thewrongreason: i overlooked it, but i agree with you ron. so, unless ion or dave think differently, i'll change my vote to 26.rxf7.  archduke_piccolo: i much prefer... 26.hxg4, keeping alive the threat on f7.  instead 26.rxf7 gxh3 27.rxg7 h2 28. rh7 a5, and black can enter an ending a pawn down, but with reasonable drawing chances.  i vote for 26.hxg4,  supersparksky: i agree with ion, 26.hxg4, connect the pawns and keep the threat of rxg7  thewrongreason: what dave posted is how i originally felt. i hate to tell you this ron, but i disagree with taking on f7, for the reason that others mentioned. so, i'll go back to my original vote with 26.hxg4.  redfoxrising: 26. hxg4 is my suggested vote as per discussion much better than what i first suggested   thewrongreason: now, i go by ron's earlier vote. i'm keeping in mind about our passed pawn, and if we take, we're one step closer to a passed pawn with the r right in front of it. so, as of now, i will vote for 27.rxf7  archduke_piccolo:  instead of... ... 27.rxf7,... is there any percentage in 27.re7ch kf4 28.re8 kxg4 29.bd3 ...? on the plus side, this establishes a bind on the undeveloped black pieces. on the down side, black's king and a-pawn might be active enough to neutralise that bind.  thoughts?  thewrongreason: it's an interesting idea, ion. and, perhaps it would be a draw soon after that, although, it is hard to say for sure.  redfoxrising: 27. re7ch looks might better than rxf7 game seems draw-ish  archduke_piccolo: no, on reflection... ... i think my concerns about black's a-pawn are correct. tying down black's q-side ties down our own pieces.  i'll vote for 27.rxf7.  redfoxrising: i'm also good with 27.rxf7  thewrongreason: i agree and will stick with 27.rxf7.  supersparksky: my suggestion is 28.bc4  archduke_piccolo: yes... 28.bc4 develops the bishop and prepares to blackade the a-pawn by ba2. the alternative is to move the king across. i do not recommend 28.rf8 -  28.rf8?! a3 29.bc4 a2 30.bxa2 rxa2 31.rxb8 ,,, as the rook ending is a likely draw.  my vote: 28.bc4.  thewrongreason: i'll also vote for 28.bc4  redfoxrising: 28. bc4 is my vote thewrongreason: i was real concerned about her a pawn since that's why charles opponent resigned. but, the bc4 stops it. i'm a little concerned about janet playing 29...kf4 which would appear to win our g4 pawn which would also disrupt that pawn chain. as such, i'm going to vote for 29.rxg7 so that if she's comes down with her monarch, the pawn is protected.  redfoxrising: i like joe's suggestion i'll support 29. rxg7 as well  archduke_piccolo: i don't think... ... that a win is possible with the piece sacrifice suggested:  29.rxg7 a2 30.bxa2 rxa2 now black's king is very close to the passed pawn pair; the knight will soon become active; and the white king is cut off from the action on the back rank. we could draw this, but not win it.  i think the obvious  29.ba2 ... to blockade the pawn, is mandatory. then we may think about taking the g-pawn.  thewrongreason: i'll change my vote then to 29.ba2  redfoxrising: i'll change my vote then to 29.ba2 after ion's post   thewrongreason: if it's safe to do so, i'll now vote for 30.rxg7.  archduke_piccolo: i can't... ... think of anything better right now, so i'll go for 30.rxg7 as well. that will give us two joined passed pawns, with the rook on hand to assist, and our bishop is reasonably placed to support them.  redfoxrising: i agree with 30 rxg7  supersparksky: how about 30.g5 followed possibly by f6 and re7+  thewrongreason: i see why you vote for that, supersparksky. although i still like 30.rxg7, i'm gonna have to change my vote to 30.g5 i normally wouldn't because of what ion mentioned, but in the aftermath of dave's variations, i would want to follow up with f6. as now, we have a dangerous pawn chain since they're well connected. one isn't passed, but with our r right there, it's just about useful. supersparksky: move 31 our next move should be 31.f6  thewrongreason: i concur with 31.f6, dave. and, i would, likely, want to follow up with 32.re7+, as you noted above.  redfoxrising: 31. f6 is my vote supersparksky: my suggestion is 32.ke2....  thewrongreason: i agree and will also vote for 32.ke2 but, it's, mainly, because it gives us the opposition which is useful in the endgame.  archduke_piccolo: actually, joe... ... it doesn't give us the 'opposition'. instead 32.ke1 would give us the opposition - what's called the 'distant opposition'. you have the opposition if there is an odd number of squares on the same rank, file or diagonal, between the kings, and it is your opponent to move. if there is just the one square between, it is the '(direct) opposition'; if more than one, the 'distant opposition.'  the opposition really only counts if the opponent has no good alternative to playing a king move. for instance, if our opponent can simply 'mark time' with some kind of 'waiting move' that doesn't hurt her game, then suddenly she would have the opposition!  in this position, we want to bring the king into action, and the 'distant opposition' doesn't really help us all that much (even apart from an annoying knight check at d3). we are in check and must move the king. first of all, do want the king on the k-side or the q-side? 32.kc2 has the virtue of protecting the c-pawn, but after that there is nowhere for the k to go. he'll be pretty much jailed.  i reckon 32.re2 is the go, all right, and, as it is unlikely that black will play 32...ke4, we can (unless we find a better course of action) establish the 'opposition' by 33.ke3.  i'll vote for 32.re2. thewrongreason: this is very difficult, but i'll vote for 33.kf3 to prevent black from playing 33...kf4 my idea would be to keep g5 protected.  archduke_piccolo: joe, you have the right idea... ...but may i suggest a refinement: 33.re7ch.  the idea is to drive the king away from the k-side pawns. black is unlikely to advance the king up the boardto e4 or f4, on account of 34.f7, whence black will be hard put to it to stop the promotion without loss. so black will play 33...kd6, and then we bring our king to f3:  so:  33.re7ch ... (a) 33...kf4 (or...ke4) 34.f7 ...  (b) 33...kd6 34.kf3 ...  redfoxrising: 33. re7+ is my suggested vote thewrongreason: thanks for the clarification ion. if we still had time, i also would've changed my vote to what white played. and, in this position, i'm thinking long term strategy which might not work because of the refinement. but, this is somewhat similar to the position that i had in the chess dream on wednsday which you'll see in my next annotation. that's where i overlooked the opportunity to take a pawn which then became passed. in doing that, i almost allowed a draw by rep which is what, finally, made me realize that my draw with the master mater was a waisted game. having said that, i'm thinking about that game. and, with that, i'm torn between 2 candidate moves involving the k with one being 34.ke3. but, my gut's telling me that we should play 34.kf3, so that'll be my vote. and, ion mentioned something about that to. my idea here is to be able to, at some point when it becomes a legal move, to get the monarch to e6 where the f6 pawn will be unstoppable. redfoxrising: 34.kf3 ... is my suggested vote  archduke_piccolo: 34.kf3 there is a subtle difference between this move and the other that comes into consideration, 34.ke3.  if 34.ke3, black will play 34...rh8, with the idea of giving check and taking out the c-pawn or maybe the bishop. now, after  34.kf3 rh8 we can play... 35.ra7 rh3ch 36.kg4 ... gains us a tempo. if now 36... rxc3 (?) 37.f7 ... wins.  thewrongreason: my thinking would've been 35.kf4, but the idea behind it is not possible, would involve illegal moves, in this position. as we just can't sneak it up to e5, let alone, e6-e7 due to her monarch, which is where i'd want it. thus, i'll base it on ion's earlier variation and vote for 35.ra7.  archduke_piccolo: yes... ... i don't think 34.kf4 is quite the thing, as black could play 34...rh2, attacking our bishop. we can't push the f-pawn for the moment as our rook would be left 'en prise' to the black king.  so we want to move the rook off e7. moving it across to a7 threatens the black a-pawn, and indirectly, the bishop as well, so 34...rh2 loses much of its force. possibly we could retire the rook along the e-file (34.re2, say), but she might get a skewer on out c-pawn. after 34.ra7, we have good prospects i think of winning the a-pawn for nothing. that will deprive black of a valuable countervailing asset, without compromising our own attacking prospects on the k-side.  my vote: 34.ra7.  supersparksky: i don't like the look of 34.ra7 after 34.ra7..rh3+. 35.kg4..rh1. 36..rxa3..rg1+! we will lose our g pawn or succumb to a 3 move repetition draw.  thewrongreason: in that case, i'll change my vote to 34.re2.  redfoxrising: 34. re2 is my vote brigadecommander: i resign it's hopeless. you guys played a fine game. let me know if you want to play another. maybe a similar game with me as black again. this time maybe we can try a berlin defense against the ruy lopez!. let me know. thank you all for the game. i enjoyed it. bc 👍  supersparksky: thanks bc, i am up for another, just let me know.  brigadecommander: dave you need at least 2-other players.message them and let me know.  redfoxrising: hope to see another game ion, joe,, i'm interested too  supersparksky: one more player needed to start another game. any takers?  thewrongreason: with more time allowing me to do so, yes, i'd be in. 
-------------------------------------
queen gambit declined, orthodox defence this is not main line of qgd, although it is played, more or less often. the most popular continuations here are 4... be7 (orthodox defence) and 4... nbd7 (which usually leads to cambridge-springs variation). black is going to prevent white's advance by making pressure on the c3 point.   this is mistake, white can't get advantage that way. better continuation would be 6. nf3, or  6. cxd5 exd5 7. exd5, with clear advantage. this is the point: black knight hits both bishop g5 and pawn c3. white has problems... white defend the bishop, and it is risky for black to try to win the с3 pawn: after 9... nxc3 10. qd2 the black knight gets tied, and it is not easy to find how to release it. the continuation 9... qxc3+ 10. qxc3 nxc3 11. dxc5 dxc4 12. rc1 ne4 13. rxc4 leads to approximately equal game. yes, of course, black knight gets tied. it is not fatal, but black now have to play accurately to avoid further problems. this is mistake. the main problem for black here was to release the tied knight c3, and this could be done by 11... nc6. after 12. dxc5 ne4 13. qxa5 nxa5 14. cxd5 exd5 15. rc1 white regain the pawn, but the position is still slightly better for black. and now white knight arrives to d4, and black can't release the c3 knight. they find another trick, but are unable to avoid major problems. this pawn fork for knight d4 and bishop f4 lets black to regain the piese, but problems for them come from another side. the black queen has to retreat, leaving knigth c3 to its fate. the king's wing of the black position is damaged, and what is worse, black king's position is exposed, which is really dangerous here. this looks necessary, because otherwise white could play exf4, and the line e gets opened for frontal attacks against the king. from the other side, black pieces are undeveloped, and spending precious time to move the pawn is also very dangerous. i don't know what continuation here would be the best for black, but it is obvious that the bad times for them are coming. more one black pawn move, while white uses every opportunity to develop their pieces, is fatal. at that moment i was sure that i'm 100% winning. and without 18... fxg2 i was going to continue 19. nxf3, geting both material and great positional advantage, which would be absolutely sufficient for victory. and in postgame analysis rybka shows here that black fails in all variations. nice position - almost all white pieces are already in the game, while neither black pieces, except the queen, started to play. black king is vulnerable from any direction, and its white opponent looks absolutely safe. black pawn g2 is an excellent defender, like sincere friend, making impossible for black to hit it in frontal attack, it looks even better defender than the white pawn :-). at that monent i was sure that black will be smashed in five moves or so.  but imagine black queen on g5, and black knight on f3 - this is mate :-(. no, this can't ever happen - black will be smashed soon! black's position is absolutely lost, the most obvious threat for them is 21... bb5+. computer shows that black are defeated in all variations, the problem for white player is only to find best continuations of the attack. but starting at this point, my opponent played briliantly, finding the strongest move, which can't be said about me... the threat 21. bb7 is not actual any more. white can't play neither 21. bxf7+ because of 21... rxf7 22. qg8+ qf8.  the best continuation, creating new threats, for example 21... a6 22. nd6+ ke7 23. bxf7 qe5 24. nxc8+ raxc8 25. rxd7+ kxd7 26. qxe5, or 21... ke8 22. qxf8+ nxf8 23. nxb8++ and nxc5.  excellent defence, wery hard to find, causing white the hardest problems to continue the attack. all threats created by the preceding play aren't actual now, because bxf7 goes without a check. this is good move, but not the best. the threat bxf7 is still dangerous, but not mortal. the best continuation, as rybka shows, would be 22. rd5!, which prevents black queen to get to  g5 square. the further play at this case could be 22... qb6 23. nd5 a6 24. nf5+ ke8 25. rd6 qa7 26. bxf7+ rxf7 27. re6+ kd8 28. qxf7, and white wins. computer shows that white still wins, but finding the way to the victory is more tricky now. black queen gets to the g5 square, does this remind you something? no, don't mind, white still wins in all variations. this would be bad idea to excange queens here, right? wow, what a nigthmare, black knight is going to jump to f3 - and black wins! and what about attack, i just haved such strong position! computer shows that white still wins, but don't speak about smashing black in five moves. this is good move, and white still going to win, but the best move would be 24. be2 re8 25. f4 qg6 26. qxe5, and white wins very soon. right idea, white first comes out of the knight fork nf3, and besides all, black king is getting again in very vulnerable place. it is again good move, but not the best. better would be first 26. bb5+ rc6 27. bxc6+ bxc6 (or 27... nxc6? 28. rxc6 rd8 29. qxd8+ qxd8 30. rxd8+ kxd8 31. rxh6), and only now 28. f4. please also note that if bishop stayed on e2 (see previous comment), f4 would be even stronger. computer shows, that white still wins, but i was already discouraged by continuous efforts not bringing me success - and i was going to smash black in five moves. i encountered the position which seemed before like unrealistic nightmare, and i still have material disadvantage. now i decided to go the way which gives me small, but reliable advantage  - and this turnes out to be mistake. if i played 28. rd5, the victory could be easily achievable: 28... g1q+ 29. rxg1 nxg1 30. rxh5; 28... qg4 (the only move black doesn't loose the knight immediately) 29. bb5+ rc6 30. bxc6+ bxc6 31. qxc6+ ke7 32. qb7+ kf6 33. rd6+ kg7 34. qxf6 - not very hard to be found. so while black made the best moves to defend, i made simply good, not the best moves to attack - but this is not enough to win. i got only material equality, but i had a hope to achieve advantage by winning the pawn g2, which sometimes looked like my sincere frend and best defender. but even so, it is queens endgame, where one pawn advantage is often not sufficient to win. so my victory is questionable now. very discouraging... unexpected, but reasonable move. the main task for white now is to escape from checks. i considered continuation 31... qh4+ 32. kg1, where it is not a problem, and taking into account that black king is in exposed position, i hoped to win. as rybka showed, 31... g1q+ is the strongest defence. now i had to decide, should the new queen be taken by king or rooch. i took by king, and this again turns out to be mistake. i did not find how, if the rooch takes, to escape from checks, but computer showed that the way existed, although being very tricky: 32. rxg1 qxh2 33. rg2 qh4+ 34. ke2 qh5+ 35. kd2! qa5+! (35... rd8? 36. rg8+) 36. kd3 qb5+ 37. ke4 qa4+ 38. kf5, king escapes, and black can't save their king - white should win.  the last hope - after 34... kf8 35. qh8+ kf7 36. rc7+ white wins, but black avoids this point. it is all, the draw is now inevitable. agreed for the draw. this move was made after we agreed for the draw, and it does not matter. 
-------------------------------------
definitely an opening i'm not used to my option goes to the most common answer to nf3 most common are c4, g3 or d4.  allowing the b to come to play thinking about my b in this phase i'm putting pieces to play and protecting my k according to the game analysis this was a mistake. next moves would be: 7. b4 a5 8. b5 ne5 9. bd2 bd7 10. a4 neg4 11. h3 ne5 12. rb1 qe7 13. g4 nxf3+ 14. qxf3 be5 e5 was a threat. between retiring the b or the n or reinforcing the defense of e5, i preferred  taking the pawn putting pressure on the n and opening the d rank in here my idea was to limit the action of the n while moving the b to the battlefield funny situation. putting pressure on the q knowing that the n could take the b. if the q moves away i was thinking about exchanging b's with the idea of making castle on the ideal side impossible. the error was made moving away with the b while keeping the pressure on nb5 the natural attack from white. this is the moment i decide a crazy attack  game analysis tells me that the way to go would be: … qe8 16. f4 bxf4 17. gxf4 axb5 18. qxb5 qxb5 19. bxb5 rxa3 20. o-o nxe4 21. rd7 nc3 22. bc4 b5 23. bd3 sacrificing the q  the idea with this ladder games is to be bold on the approach to the game.   in team games and tournaments i would never would try this white's big error. rd2 would level things up from now on things are lost for white ... and i was happy with it! 
-------------------------------------
  +1.13... not that much advantage anymore. ? +2.66 ... this move seems logical at first sight (and was exactely what i expected). qh5 would have been much stronger though, as black could have won my knight: (… qh5 19. bf1 qe8 20. bxa6+ kb8 21. h3 qxh8 22. bc4 qc8 23. kh2 qb7 24. bxe6 qb6 25. rd8+ kb7 26. bb3 qxe3... +1.13 according to the analyzer)
-------------------------------------
this is my latest battle against kaboes, who, as i write, is currently 2nd in the fast ladder.  i'm 71st.  my record hitherto against him doesn't look bad but i think all my wins came relatively early in our history.  anyway, looking for a hoick up the ladder, i decide to play a solid opening...  this commentary was written before reading the computer analysis.  i've then added computer commentary.  i think this demonstrates that i didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time! the dreaded dutch, his favourite response, against which i have not done well. i look to disrupt his opening as much as possible with this potential pin of the n against q, discouraging the black e-pawn from moving, or so i think. so much for that theory! both sides have played natural developing moves so far.  this pawn prevents my n from going to e5. at last black challenges the intrusive prelate. i didn't fancy the prospect fo a pawn storm trapping the b on g3, so swapped immediately. now black has the advantage of the bishop pair here come the pawns anyway.  this seems to be easier for black to achieve with the dutch than with, say, the king's indian, since black doesn't have to muck about with his kn to enable his f-pawn to advance.  the computer prefers 9...0-0 white counter-thrusts in the centre, as advised in all good chess primers :-) ...but every pawn move leaves two squares that were previously defended undefended.  so black hops his n onto one of them. spotting the opportunity to plant my n on e6, i sidestep black's offer to swap. now black takes the opportunity to make it 2 bishops against 2 knights.  which is better in this position? clearly black doesn't like that balance... ?!  the computer calls this an inaccuracy, preferring 13. exd4.  i remember debating with myself how to recapture but i don't remember this line, given by the computer:  best: +0.72 » 13. exd4  o-o  14. rae1 re8  15. f4 kg7  16. rf2 bd7  17. rfe2 qf6  18. dxe6 rxe6  19. nd5 rxe2  20. rxe2 around about here, i remember trying to calcualte the pros and cons of each kingside pawn move.  no advance to the 4th rank seemed to help me, so i settled for this more flexible option. black develops his last minor piece and appears to threaten either to castle queenside, having ruined his kingside, or to try to undermine white's pawns with ...b5 so i demonstrated against the queenside, discouraging ..b5 and preparing an attack on the castled king's position if he went long. now it was my turn to launch a pawn storm :-) ? i didn't realise this at the time, but the computer suggests that this is a mistake, suggesting i respond with 19. ra1, not an obvious move to a human after recently centralising the rook.  it prefers ...rdg8:  mistake: +1.33 » … b6  18. ra1 kb7  19. a5 rhg8  20. b5 ra8  21. axb6 axb5  22. bxc7 rxa1  23. rxa1 bxc4  24. qe2 kxc7  25. qxc4+ best: +0.21 » … rdg8 18. e4 g4 19. qe3 gxf3 20. rxf3 qg5 21. qxg5 rxg5 22. h4 rh5 23. exf5 rxf5 24. kf2 ?!  onwards and upwards!  but, of course, the computer calls this an inaccuracy now there's an empty file for me to try to exploit. black, in turn, exploits the pin against my undefended queen to protect b7 moving the q off the d-file would have sacrificed the d-pawn but i couldn't see a mating attack that would have made it worthwhile and black's q defended the rh8 which might otherwise have been picked up after 22. qb2 bxd5 23. nxd5 rxd5 24. qb8+ kd7.  i don't remember considering the possibility i've just seen now, though, of 24. qb7+ kd8 or kd7 25. qxd5+.  black would not, therefore, have been able to respond with bxd5, so probably 22. qb2 would have been stronger here.  22...rxd5 would have sacrificed the exchange for the sake of defending b7.  it will be interestign to see the computer's take on this. black defends a6. and white defends d5 ... releasing f4 to black's pawn, which solidifies the kingside somewhat, leaving white free rein to attack. white prepares to double on the b-file.  the computer calculates my advantage as +1.47 at this point. ??

the grunfeld.  i don't think we've played this one between us before. i vary from my usual response of 3. nc3.  the experiment works out quite well. instead of swapping on c3, the n retreats to a not particularly useful square.  the computer gives me the slightest edge after this. identified by the computer as an inaccuracy.  it prefers "… nc6 9.  be3  bf6  10. e5 be7  11. qb3 qd7  12. rac1 bf5  13. rfd1 rad8  14. bd3 bxd3  15. rxd3. +0.23"  odd that it gets the move-numbering wrong.  black's pawn structure is typical of the slav defence, which is very sound, so i think sheridan can be forgiven this :-)  now the computer gives me a whole pawn advantage!... but it doesn't last long :-(  this is the start of a sustained attack on black's kingside which, i feel, should have been more successful than it ultimately was, whether due to sheridan's defensive skills or my attacking errors remains to be seen. curiously, my advantage drops to +0.49 with this move, though the computer suggests no alternative. black continues to try to catch up on development. it would be standard policy to park this r on c1, controlling the half-open file but it bites on granite at c6.  on d1, the r supports a potential later central thrust and opposes black's q. now black starts to try to undermine white's impressive looking centre by pinning the qn against white's q and thus threatening to capture the e4 pawn.  i had to think quite hard about how to deal with this threat, eventually opting to bolster e4 with my lsb. now my "advantage" drops to +0.24, so presumably the computer doesn't like this, though does not suggest a better move. black renews the threat to e4 and establishes even tighter control over d5.  if white is tempted to play e5, black will have a lovely outpost for the rest of the game.  nevertheless, the computer doubles white's advantage again! now the e4 pawn is over-protected and the n is no longer pinned.  blacks dsb is looking superfluous, so... black swaps.  the computer doesn't like this, again doubling white's advantage to +0.98, but in this sort of position, black's ns are likely to more than match white's bs. now white has a typical grunfeld pawn structure but black still has two ns. black gets his q off the d-file, allowing a r to occupy d8 and apply further pressure to white's centre. again, white opposes the enemy q with a r.  white's development is now complete and it is time to develop a plan. black creates a hole for his k (or b if it is attacked) but also provides a target for white. white's n seizes a key central square from which to dominate black's position.  i was in two minds whether to follow this up with nxg6 if black allowed.  i generally like to swap ns for bs but in this position white's n looks much stronger than black's b, so it would be an odd swap unless there were some concrete tactical advantage to be gained. black retreats anyway, so i don't need to choose. this is a double edged move: if black swaps pawns i get a nice pin on his nf6 and can follow up with a full-scale kingside attack with minor and major pieces.  on the other hand, white's king is looking exposed, so, if the attack fails, black will probably mate white quickly (but such possibilities are a long way down the line at this stage). i was quite pleased with this position, though unsure how to proceed.  the computer has dropped bmy advantage by 0.1 to +0.90 now. ?  the computer nails this as a mistake because it allows "… rad8 20.  ng4  qc7  21. bxf6 gxf6  22. nxf6+ kh8  23. qh5 rg8+  24. kh1 rg7  25. e5 na4  26. nxh7 nxc3 (+3.54)".  however i saw an even "cleverer" move ... !??  i had my heart in my mouth as i played this picturesque move, apparently putting the q en prise but exploiting the pin on the nf6 against the qe7.  it's the kind of move that would cause a lesser opponent to panic but sheridan reacted calmly.  of course the prosaic computer sees none of the beauty in my concept and has black launching a queenside frolic with his own q:  blunder: +0.62 » 21.  qh5  nbd7  22. qf3 qa3  23. bb1 qb2  24. ng4 rc8  25. c4 nxg4  26. hxg4 c5  27. re2 best: +4.20 » 21. ng4 qa3 22. bxf6 rc8 23. qd2 gxf6 24. nxf6+ kh8 25. e5 rg8+ 26. kh2 nd5 27. nxh7 nxc3 28. ra1  now, even though black plays the computer's preferred move, white's advantage has apparently climbed to +1.47, so even after my "blunder" i have still improved my advantage. played with the objective of maintaining the pressure on the h4-d8 diagonal by removing one of the nf6's defenders.  the computer, of course, identifies this as another mistake, though now its preferred move is 22. qh4 rather than 22. qf3 as in the earlier note. black recaptures with the q, thus releasing the pin for a lesser pin.  the computer prefers the rook capture followed by ...e5.  curiously, the move-numbering errors only occur on black's moves, not white's:  "mistake: +2.14 » … qxd7  22. qh4 bg6  23. e5 nh7  24. bxd8 bxd3  25. rxd3 qxd8  26. qg4 qg5  27. rg3 qxg4  28. hxg4 best: +0.59 » … rxd7 22. qh4 e5 23. be2 qe6 24. bf3 exd4 25. rxd4 rd5 26. bxf6 gxf6 27. exd5 qxe1+ 28. kg2 cxd5 29. bxd5" now this is identified as an inaccuracy: i guess because, in human chess terms, it releases the tension too early.  by delaying the exchange a couple of moves, white could have gained another point advantage, according to the computer:  "inaccuracy: +1.18 » 23.  bxf6  gxf6  24. qh4 kg7  25. re3 bg6  26. rg3 e5  27. dxe5 fxe5  28. qg5 qc7  29. h4 kg8  30. h5 rxd3 best: +2.16 » 23. qh4 bg6 24. e5 nd5 25. bxg6 fxg6 26. bxd8 qxd8 27. qxd8 rxd8 28. rd3 g5 29. c4 nf4 30. rb3 b6"   this move threatens mate in one, so black has to do something about it.  i expected ...bxd3, when i could lift my r to d3 and then deliver mate from g3 but the computer recommends the much better ...bg6. ?

and now i'm back to the heady heights of +0.76, so i think this must be a good move! (though it's pretty obvious so hardly worthy of an exclamation mark) this was a bit mysterious and had me worried for a while.  it's not clear what black plans to do with this b.  perhaps it's a question of putting it somewhere safe where white won't bother to molest it.  if he'd just played it to g6, i'd have harassed it with the h-pawn.  if he'd played it to g4, we might have settled for a draw by repetition if i'd gone 36. rg7 bh5 37. rg5 etc now i had visions (hallucinations?) of marching the king via the dark squares to c7 or e7 and harassing black's pawns but this was never to be. ?! and the computer would have preferred me to continue at least part-way with my plan:  "inaccuracy: +0.25 » 37.  f4  bh5  38. kf2 bg4  39. bc2 kh7  40. c4 rg6  41. d5 cxd5  42. cxd5 exd5  43. bxf5 bxf5  44. rxf5 d4  45. rd5 rh6  46. h5 best: +0.85 » 37. kf4 kh7 38. rxg8 kxg8 39. kg5 kh7 40. h5 bf3 41. bc2 b6 42. bd3 bd5 43. c4 bf3 44. a3 a5"  now my k is doomed to lurk at the back so long as black's b occupies d1.  ? but now it is black's turn to make a mistake.  the pawn on e6 should be about to become a weakling as a result of this move:  "mistake: +2.24 » … rg6  37. rxg6 fxg6  38. bc4 kg8  39. bxe6+ kf8  40. c4 be2  41. d5 cxd5  42. cxd5 bc4  43. a4 bb3  44. a5 bc4 best: +0.26 » … kh7 37. c4 bg4 38. kf2 rg6 39. d5 rxg5 40. fxg5 exd5 41. cxd5 cxd5 42. bf1 d4 43. bg2 b5 44. bd5" ?? arguably the losing move.  we don't often describe failures to win material as "blunders" in the way that we describe moves that lose material; but this move surely qualifies as such.  i completely failed to see the weakling at e6 and was still obsessed with my king's scope for activity (a worthy obsession in the endgame but unforgivable when it blinds one to match-winning opportunities):  "blunder: -1.36 » 39.  kf2  kg8  40. be2 bxe2  41. kxe2 kf7  42. a4 kxf6  43. c4 b6  44. kd3 c5  45. kc3 a6  46. d5 ke7  47. kd3 kd6 best: +2.34 » 39. bc4 bc2 40. bxe6 bd3 41. c4 b6 42. kf3 bb1 43. a3 bd3 44. ke3 be4 45. bf7 kh7 46. h5 gxh5 47. bxh5 kg8" now the score is -1.75 as the pawn on f6 is domed and white's pawn structure is a complete mess.  black's win is easy from here. ?!  nevertheless, black can still make life more difficult for himself, apparently:  "inaccuracy: -1.64 » … ke7  43. c5 kf6  44. kd3 b6  45. cxb6 axb6  46. a4 kg7  47. ke2 kg8  48. kd3 kf7  49. kc3 ke7  50. kb4 kd7  51. a5 bxa5+  52. kxa5 kd6 best: -2.42 » … b5 43. d5 exd5 44. cxb5 cxb5 45. kd4 ke6 46. kc5 d4 47. kxd4 kd6 48. ke3 kd5 49. kd3 b4 50. ke3 a5 51. kf3 kc4 52. ke3" ?? but white is now determined to give the game away, it seems.  i thought my best chance lay in giving black an isolated d-pawn but of course i was soon to run out of waiting moves that would give me the opposition usefully.  the computer shows how i could at least have made black fight for a win:  "blunder: -5.02 » 44.  d5  exd5  45. cxd5 c5  46. a4 kd6  47. kd3 kxd5  48. kc3 b6  49. kd3 a6  50. kc3 b5  51. kb3 ke4  52. a5 kxf4  53. kc3 ke4  54. kb3 best: -1.72 » 44. c5 b6 45. cxb6 axb6 46. ke2 kd6 47. ke3 kd5 48. kd3 c5 49. dxc5 kxc5 50. kc3 kd5 51. kd3 b5 52. a3 e5 53. fxe5 f4 54. h5" ?! if i wanted to gain the opposition, i might have done better to delay my arrival on this square by first playing 46. d3, as now i am forced to play the first waiting move. the computer now scores this position -7.65.  white can resign with a clear conscience. !

nearly all my games on the fast ladder have been against lower-rated opposition whom i challenged because they were higher up the ladder, so in most i have been black.  recently, the tables have been turned on me as higher-rated played lower down the ladder have challenged me.  here is one such challenge i survived by the skin of my teeth.  i open with 1.d4, which has recently been my habit against higher-rated players. black replies with the albin counter-gambit, a favourite of two of my colleagues at didcot chess club. despite several knockabout games at the club, i still don't know it. this seems to be the principled response. this pawn is designed to be a thorn in white's front. i hasten my development, attacking the pawn at the same time and inadvertently avoid the lasker trap: "the careless move 4.e3? can lead to the lasker trap. after 4...bb4+ 5.bd2 dxe3 6.bxb4?? is a blunder — 6...exf2+ 7.ke2 fxg1=n+ and black wins. the lasker trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion as early as move 7." ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albin_countergambit ) black bolsters the pawn, establishing a powerful centre that i'm going to have to play around. as mentioned, i decide to develop around the black pawns, rather than challenge them directly with 5. e3 (the lasker trap would no longer work because the pawn on c5 prevents 5...bb4+).  of 5. g3, wikipedia says: "perhaps white's surest try for an advantage is to fianchetto his king bishop with 5.g3 followed by bg2 and nbd2. black will often castle queenside. a typical continuation is 5.g3 be6 6.nbd2 qd7 7.bg2 0-0-0 8.0-0 bh3." i diverge from wikipedia's line, not that i was following it at the time (i'm just using it as reference for the annotation).  i think this move is in the gameknot database, though.  it's consistent with my avoidance of 5. e3 and plan to fianchetto, defending the c4 pawn with another pawn. black continues to develop his queenside, probably preparing queenside castling. counter-attacking black's q but depriving my qn of its best square. offering the e-pawn back for developing. black ignores the offer to get his k to relative safety. now i defend the pawn to make room for my qn. black prepares to push the b back again. now developing the n to d2 would have deprived the b of retreat squares, so it goes to a3, hoping to attack from b5. black scotches that idea. a knight on the rim is dim and he has no future over there, so he heads back towards the centre. as predicted, the b is pushed back and black finally wins back his pawn. threatening to skewer q and r from a5, a threat easily parried, but it also gets my q off the d-file, which black has occupied with a rook. white is preparing to break out in the centre some time soon. attacking the loose n on c2. ?! as the game developed, this didn't turn out badly but it desrves at least a "dubious" because i'd failed to see the force of black's reply. ! the pawn is pinned and can't be defended. ! i think this was making the best of a bad job.   on conventional scoring, i only lose 1 point and should be able to contest control of the centre. black hastens to develop his remaining pieces.  for a gambiteer, he is surprisingly behind in development but has got rid of white's queen. a slow move, depriving black's qn of a key square and preparing to open a second front in front of black's k. pointing at white's kingside.  if black can get in a few moves with his h-pawn, he will have a powerful attack. white continues with his plan. black seizes the opportunity to harass the n that defends b4.  the downside of this move is that the pawn is now out on a limb (well, in thin air really!) white uses the square released by black's last move to threaten to occupy d5, attacking black's q. black goes for the extra pawn, by opening up the position in front of his k and q. rather than 23...n moves 24. rc1 pinning q against k.  now some careful calculations are required... winning back the b-pawn while i can, before going after the c-pawn; also revealing an attack on the loose d-pawn. preventing the d-pawn from advancing.   28. rc1 would have been a blunder because of the fork. pinning the c-pawn which advances to (apparently) defend the d-pawn, though of course it is pinned .... because of the pin, this threatens to win the d-pawn. this attacks the b but makes no difference to the calculation of the capture on d3. black sidesteps the pin.  now either the b or the r behind it appears doomed but i spot a neat trick based on a revealed check. apparently this loses the rd2 but ... ! revealed check: black can't block it sensibly because the q is pinned by the b, which can't be taken because of the check.  i think this move was difficult to spot because the square appears to be well defended by black's q and f-pawn. now white is two clear pawns ahead but the advantage is difficult to exploit because one of them is doubled and black has a remote pawn that soon becomes a passed pawn.  i think i should have prevented that from happening. ? inviting black to fork white's 4th rank pawns. !  this is a powerful fork.  white doesn't want black to take either pawn, one of which restrains black's a-pawn, one provides a direct line to white's king. ? the easy option but in retrospect the b-pawn was the more important to save. preparing to counter-attack on the 7th rank and hoping then to promote the advanced f-pawn. black prepares to block the check and defend his f-pawn at the same time. moving the king within the queening square (both black's a-pawn and white's k are 5 moves from a1). i need the tempo provided by this check to enable my k to get across the board.  i may also be able to snaffle the f-pawn or get behind the a-pawn if black errs. i decided to keep rooks on as i didn't trust my ability to both capture the a-pawn and get back to defend or promote my own pawns in a pure pawn endgame.  after 40. rxc7+ kxc7, white's k would be 5 moves from capturing the a-pawn.  black could use those 5 moves to capture the rear f-pawn and would then be able to hunt down the remaining pawns if white's king scuttled back across the board.  white would have to deploy careful tactics to try to get a passed pawn while black's king was in pursuit. so i opted for trying to prevent black from moving his pawn by delivering frontal checks. black can't move away from his r or pawn else he loses one or both.  if he retreats behind the pawn he can't support its advance effectively. black had to defend the r i couldn't see a way of forcing a win, so was happy to implicitly offer a draw by repetition. with this move, black offered the draw that gameknot would have declared next move anyway.

solo mueve a la dama al inicio si sabes lo que haces p: defendiendo f7, para salvar el enroque intercambia un caballo por un peon, very smart intercambia un alfil por un peon, so smart p: defendiendo a la torre pésimo movimiento  knight fork  knight fork again (:  knight fork = cuando un caballado da check y ademas ataca piezas valiosas como la dama o las torres  
-------------------------------------
se aparta de la línea y a mi juicio es una jugada floja que dejará a las negras bajo ataque constante sobre su peón de e4 interesante era (6.- ….-f6 ; 7.- ae3-e5; 8.- a3- af5 etc) aquí yo esperaba (10.- ….-db6 ; 11.- ae4-ae4; 12.- de4- db2; 13.- tb1- da2;14.- cf3- da6; 15.- 0-0 –e6; 16.- c5) con juego complicado. la jugada de rodrigo es dudosa ya que posteriormente perderá un peón y dejará al blanco muy activo y con un rey centralizado la jugada ac3 de las blancas previene que las negras respondan tranquilamente c5 obteniendo cierto contra juego lárgate al realizar la jugada txf3 pensé mucho ya que estaba calculando (22.-rxe4-th3 ; 23.- th1.- tf8; 24.- ae1- thf3 y mi ventaja ya no la veo tan clara como antes) rodrigo pasó por alto c5!? la cual era de cierta manera un tanto liberadora sé que este final está ganado, pero con 10 minutos en el reloj no encontraba manera alguna de materializar mi ventaja esto ya es ajedrez de cementerio (la frase se refiere al ajedrez callejero, en general es más furtivo, agudo y hasta especulativo; también le llamamos "ajedrez diversión") en el apuro de tiempo rodrigo no encontró la correcta, a mi juicio ofrecía mayor resistencia ce7! con e5+ se evita ae7+ de las negras con molestias para las blancas, y en el apuro de tiempo lo último que quiero es pensar durante más tiempo del debido si bien las blancas están ganadas, con esa jugada el negro prácticamente deja de ofrecer resistencia, el resto fue "coser y cantar"  
-------------------------------------
la jugada común es cc6, pero quería sacar a juan de las líneas conocidas bueno, no es línea, y es una jugada poco típica de mi parte, pero al menos jugaremos ajedrez puro 7.o-o ae7 8.ae3 o-o 9.f4 cxd4 10.axd4 ac6 11.ad3 es otra posibilidad (héctor mamani) es dudosa ya que permite la jugada lógica ag5 y molesta brevemente el desarrollo negro no es una jugada mala ya que disminuyo la presión, sin embargo parece más precisa ag7 14.nd5 nxd5 15.exd5 na7 ( 15...nb8 16.qc3 ) 16.nxa5 tal vez era más precisa, por los temas en la columna e (héctor mamani) es indiscutible que la posición de las blancas es superior, pero la estructura negra es bastante defendible es cierto que las blancas están tomando el peón de a5 pero no es tan gratis el asunto ya que también quedan tocadas en a4 en este momento juan pasa su dedo índice limpiando sobre la casilla b4, señalándome indirectamente que si tomo aa4 el jugará db4 seguido de un posterior sacrificio con cb6 ok acepte el sacrificio ya que no vi peligro alguno para las negras ahora el sacrificio no vale nada ya que se defiende con td7  (sebastián urquiola)el sacrificio da ventaja a las blancas, porque después de 21 cb6,cb; 22 db6, td7; 23 aa6!, ca6; 24 da6, tb7 (si se mueve el rey, viene te4! con idea de tc4) 25 te8!, te8; 26 dc6 ganando la torre y con ventaja en el final.  la idea era evitar dc4 llevando mi caballo a c5 pero en ese caso más precisa era cd7 mucho mejor era ta8 el caballo no se puede tomar ya que el ataque blanco seria imparable, el alfil es la mejor pieza defensiva de la cuál dispongo en este momento mucho más exacta era dd8 seguido de thd8 según fritz ("el amigo de todos", [héctor mamani]) en esta posición las blancas ganan con la inesperada rb1, pero claramente era una jugada sumamente difícil de ver, las negras quedarían sin jugadas útiles, por ej 27.- rb1- g5 28.-t1e3- ab5 29.- db5- ta8 30.- dc6+-rb8 31.- tc4- tc8 32.- hxg5- dg5 33.- ta3- ta3 34.- ba3- dd2 35.- ta4 y las blancas ganan nuevamente era más preciso ta8 en esta posición gerardo hernández recomendó 29.- db5 afirmando que era ganadora ya que se amenaza la descubierta ca5, a lo cual juan estuvo de acuerdo, sin embargo en ese momento lo dije y discrepo de ellos ya que es fácilmente refutada con 29 ….- te4 30.- te4- ta8 y las blancas no tienen nada, ni siquiera te7 ya que se toma con tranquilidad dxe7 se acabo el ataque, juan no pudo encontrar las más precisas, en este momento ya hay completa igualdad en el tablero en el apuro de tiempo yo tenía clara la igualdad que estaba frente a mí, pero la jugada te8 pierde automáticamente ya que se activan enormemente las piezas blancas, de haber jugado gxh4 se entraba a una posición con oportunidades igualadas en el final (claro que fritz afirma que simplificando todo ganan las negras….) en este punto abandoné la partida, sobre este final comprendí que tener unos 8 min es tiempo suficiente para jugar este tipo de final, las 2 últimas jugadas que realice al final fueron mecánicamente jugadas pensando en el tiempo y que la posición estaba equilibrada, no hay que desesperarse por el reloj, deja que la mente trabaje por si sola…. 
-------------------------------------
carlos chepillo es un jugador ordenado,pero a veces esto decanta en ser pasivo, por lo que desde el principio, busqué un juego que me diera oportunidades de ataque. aps, una defensa francesa la "mal llamada" variante tarrasch parece que iremos por senderos más tranquilo de los que yo esperaba, tal vez era mejor utilizar la variante del avance o bien la variante del cambio "amenazando" con cambiar todo... si bien es perfectamente posible (se obtiene el control de "e5" por un buen rato) preferí mantener las piezas en el tablero ya me dieron ganas de realizar algo en el flanco de dama... las casillas blancas, como en la memorable capablanca - nimzovitch.  apuntando a las susodichas casillas blancas y preparando el paso a la torre en "d1". claro, todo esto ya se había jugado, pero en ese momento no lo sabía.  rayos... mi invasión tendrá que esperar, por otro lado, tácticamente hablando, el alfil de "e7" está un instante en el aire... se ve venir un cf5. evalué que, si lo hago de inmediato, seguiría 11 cf5, ef; 12 de7, af3; 13 gf, te8; 14 da3 y no me convencía la posición de las blancas. ¿por qué no llevar las piezas al centro?  11 c3 con idea de ag5 y ce5 se había jugado en 1920 (!!)  ¡chepi está vivo! y reacciona en el centro pensando que en todas quedo mejor, pero igual existirán ciertas complicaciones. 13 dh5 también es una opción viable. el tema es que las blancas tienen más piezas participando en el flanco, pero faltan debilidades defendiendo f5 y no permitiendo que mi dama se vaya al flanco de rey. ahora tenía la opción de tomar en c5 o desarrollar primero el alfil dama. al parecer, el negro no tiene opciones o son remotas, de realizar algo contundente por la diagonal h1-a8 en fin, decidí hacer ambas.  ok, hasta acá había calculado, solo que omití que ahora el peón negro de "c" estaba en 4 y no en 5. o sea, después de df5; 18 db7, dc2 no tengo la maniobra tac1 y tc5. claro, la posición sigue ofreciendo lucha, pero será por gusto, no me llamaba tanto la atención. si no conseguía eliminar el peón de "c" mi mayoría en el flanco de dama no daría fruto. sin embargo, carlos chepillo realizó... en esta linea yo pensaba jugar dc5, pero ví.. y pienso que las blancas están bien. ahora es posible matar el último hombre del flanco de dama: 21 aa7. estuve a punto de jugarlo, pero algo cruzo por mi mente, claro, las casillas negras están débiles; ah6 gana un tiempo, porque amenaza ganar calidad, entonces, lo único que se debe lograr es sacar a la dama negra de "c6" para que sea posible un df6 con mate imparable. 21 ad5, td5 22 td5, dd5; 23 ah6 te8?; 24 df6 lo consigue, pero es mejor 23.., tad8 para dar jaque en d4 y cambiar las damas. tozudamente, intenté con idea de si 22.., td5?; 23 td5, dd5; 24 df6 :d la defensa del negro, simplemente es dar un jaque en b6, manteniendo la dama en sexta fila y tomando de alfil en d5. ¿qué hubiese pasado si tomo primero de torre? es lo mismo, solo que hay un detalle: 22 td5, db6?; 23 tc5! dc5; 24 rh1 ¡ganando! eso es lo que calculé en el momento, pero no es cierto, porque, simplemente, las negras dan jaque en d4, apoyadas por la torre de d8, cambiando las damas... esto es prueba del mal estado de mi cálculo... ahora, la dama está tomando en b2. puedo cambiar las damas con df2, me olvido del flanco de rey y después de los cambios, mi rey controla la entrada de la torre a "e2". el problema, el final resultante es de alfiles de colores opuestos, en igualdad de condiciones. no es muy atractiva esta alternativa. lo otro es mantener las piezas, a costa del peón de b2, pero conservando las damas. peligroso... otra muestra de mi deplorable estado en el cálculo, ahora pensé que tee8 pierde, por 25 de8 (??) simplemente, las negras toman, 26.. td8 y la torre está clavada. además, se puede tomar de dama 26.. dd8 y sigue siendo dama de menos.  ok, ya había visto antes, pero pensé en ese momento que el cambio de damas era inminente; o sea, quería entrar en esta linea por si las negras terminaban tentándose con el peón b2 y mantener así las piezas. pero aquí no puedo tomar de dama. (25 dd4, te1!) molesto por las continuas equivocaciones, me aboqué al análisis de la única opción en parte, se llegó a lo que esperaba. si pestañeo pierdo los peones del flanco de dama y el de "c" se convertirá en un peligroso verdugo. mmm, pero las debilidades en el flanco de rey de las negras continuan...  la idea es que si la dama sale de la diagonal negra (a1 - h8) viene 27 dd4 y por fin hay mate en g7. "chepi" defiende "c4" y mantiene el control de la crítica diagonal. tengo el tiempo para simplificar.. ¡cuidado! si 27 td8?, da1 ¡y las negras ganan! hay que "darse un aire" ahora sí claramente, mi alfil crea más amenazas. ¿podré crear una segunda debilidad? es necesaria para progresar, ya que las piezas negras están atadas. tal vez el peón de paso "c". hay que tener cuidado con los jaques de dama, pero como son en casillas negras, tendré la posibilidad de bloquear con mi alfil.  "chepi" está atento, cualquier desliz me permite jugar dd4 o dc3 y dar mate. la dama ahora se mantiene en la sexta y permite realizar la jugada de bloqueo "f6". ahora evaluaba 33 dc3, f6 34 dc4, para obligar al rey a irse al fondo del tablero, 34.., rh8. (no 34.., af7?;35 dc1 y el mate es imparable) aquí me apareció otra opción, o nuevamente me apareció la opción ¡de acabar con el peón de a7! mi intuición me decía que mi alfil de h6 estaba quedando encerrado... pero con dos peones libres... ¡sorpesa! el rey se pasea por las casillas blancas... en este momento ocurrió algo curioso, con el silencio de la sala de juego, ¡se escuchó sonar el estómago de mi rival! claro, ya era hora de almuerzo.. ¿será por eso que chepi jugó tan intrépidamente. era imposible no recordar una partida de nigel short, con un rey que se pasea hasta apoyar el mate.  ya en apuros de tiempo, solo pensaba en tejer un mate. la idea, de3.  ví lo que venía, pero me llamó la atención un detalle en los cambios por fin mi alfil se libera y el final se aclara un poco más para el blanco. los peones pasados aunque separados pueden ser defendidos por el rey blanco. se podría pensar que si las negras mantienen las piezas en la misma posición, no hay forma de avanzar, pero las blancas forzarán el cambio con ad6 en algún momento.  este final probablemente se iguala, manteniendo el alfil de casillas blancas en la diagonal a4 - e8. aunque, claro, con pocos minutos en el reloj, las cosas cambian. al final conseguí pasar el peón de h (!!) forzando al alfil de casillas blancas a la sobrecarga clásica de las dos diagonales y gané en el filo de la caída de bandera.

oscar, históricamente ha cometido errores graves en la apertura, en  las partidas que le conozco, por lo rápido de su juego. esta vez decido utilizar un orden de jugadas poco usual y como se verá, nuevamente cayó en una imprecisión. claro, esto no significa "jugar a esperar el error", solo que si sabes que tu rival le cuesta algo, ¿por qué hacerle la vida más fácil? la sicología está presente en el ajedrez.  aquí está. las blancas quedarán con ventaja.   en otra partida se había jugado: 8.nxc6 bxc6 9.fxe5 dxe5 10.bxf7+ ke7 11.qxd8+ kxd8 12.bg5 ke7 13.bb3 bg7 14.o-o-o bg4 15.rd2 h6 16.be3 rhb8 [1-0, mukhametgaleeva railya (rus) - moiseenko olga (rus), dagomys (russia) 2004.04]  el truco consiste en bloquear la diagonal del alfil blanco de las negras, que defiende el caballo "suelto" en g4. oscar busca un mejor recaudo para el corcel. la posición es claramente favorable a las blancas. pero, no hay posición ganada, hasta que se gana. y bueno, aquí solté la mano. juan meruvia daba la idea que después fue confirmada por el computador: 12.af4 cxc4 13.dd4 (la idea es apuntar a la torre en el aire) ah6 14.axh6 dh4+ 15.g3 dxh6 16.dxc4 de3+ 17.ce2 tb8 18.tf1 tf8.  ahora en cambio, oscar conseguirá algo más de libertad.  de nuevo le doy más opciones. más duro era 14.dd2 dh4+ 15.dg3 dh5 16.td1 af8 17.dd4 rc7 18.da4 rb7 ( 18...ab7 19.da5+ ) 19.db4+ rc7 20.cd5+ pero en ese momento seguía pensando que el camino sencillo no era una mala decisión.  y aquí estamos, cambiando un par de piezas, con dos peones de más y uno en séptima... ¿a quién no le gusta? todo marchaba dentro de lo esperado, solo debo regularizar el tema de la columna c y cambiar un alfil... alternative variation: 19.h4 rhf8 20.rh3   esto también era esperado, todavía seguía muy confiado alternative variation: 20.bc4   ¿por qué tomar con el rey? sutil diferencia que marcará diferencia. alternative variation: 21.rd3 rb4 22.nc3   aquí caí en cuenta que el alfil tocaba en h2, y la torre de "b" pasará entrépidamente a b7 para terminar con la vida del aventurero peón de f7... pagué por mi relajo. ahora, a re evaluar. una vez que el peón f7 caiga, la principal amenaza de las negras sería entrar por la columna f, a la segunda fila. las blancas deben encontrar un método para bloquear tal entrada, sin perder las oportunidades de victoria o por lo menos de mantener la igualdad. en estos finales, el alfil es superior al caballo, pero claramente, uno puede seguir buscando... las negras esperan 23.c5 tbxf7 24.txf7 txf7 25.cxd6 axd6 26.h3 tf2 27.g4 ae5 con compensación o incluso un poco mejor. la jugada de la partida me gustó, porque el rey marcha a e2 proponiendo un juego activo  si 23...tbxf7 24.txf7 txf7 25.re2 con idea de tentar a las negras a llevar su torre a f4. el punto es que después de re3, la torre queda tocada, lo que obliga a las negras a gastar un tiempo (como g5) para luego jugar c5 y amenazar la maniobra ad4 - tf2. entonces, alcanzo a defender el peón de h2.   sangre fría no es algo que sobre en la siguiente variante: 24.cxb2 txb2+ 25.rc3 txg2 26.tf6 txa2 27.td1   alternative variation: 24...bf6   ahora es la oportunidad del caballo el caballo marcha a d3, donde hará de todo, defiende f4, f2 ataca e5, lava, plancha y toca el acordeón...   me parece que en este momento, faltando a la etiqueta, oscar me ofrece tablas (debe realizarse con el tiempo propio)  ¿creo que puedo ganar? la verdad, no lo sé, solo entiendo que si no veo cómo ganan las negras, porque no intentar crear algo... ahora mi idea es entrar por la columna b, tomando en algun momento en e5, dejando a c5 y al propio peón de e5 como objetivos. ¿y las negras? no es que estén atadas, solo que si tu rival te ofrece nuevamente tablas, da a entender que no ve posibilidades de victoria... la jugada de oscar me da un nuevo tema, así que, intentaremos aprovecharlo. aquí va la torre se burla la amenaza de ce5, pero se suelta la casilla f4. esto será muy importante luego. sin embargo, sabía que faltaba algo más en el flanco de rey, si tan solo los peones negros estuvieran más cerca... si: 32...ta7 33.cf4   con la idea de ganar el peón, cambiar las torres y atacar el flanco de rey ¡ahí está! el apuro me da justo lo que necesito alternative variation: 34...kd7   ahora las torres se cambian y, por fin, el camino se aclara.  alternative variation: 37...g5   las blancas tienen ventaja ganadora también había analizado: 39.cf4 h4 40.cg6 af6 41.rd3 rxa5 42.cf4 ra6 43.cd5 ag5 ( 43...ae5 44.ce7 ) 44.ce3 con idea de cf5, es imposible defender ambos peones.  también 40...af6 41.cf8   42...rc7 43.cf5 ab2 44.g6   1-0, mamani, héctor - gutierrez, oscar, arica 20- 1-2010 festival arica 2010  
-------------------------------------
me sentí happy en esta posición. ultra conocido es, en vez de 6 e3, 6cd5. las negras aprovechan la oportunidad para asaltar el centro  para mantener una "sana" estructura de peones. el desarrollo del flanco de rey sigue siendo ventajoso para las negras. mi idea, abrir la posición para garantizar juego a los alfiles.    súper optimista, mi caballo quiere molestar al único representante de la raza "alfil" de las blancas, lo que le dejará solo una opción, o vigilar el flanco de dama (soltando las casillas e4 y d3) o el flanco de rey, (dejando la diagonal g8-a2) también se había jugado: 11.o-o nd7 12.a4 ne5 13.be2 a5 14.f4 nd7 15.ndb5 c6 16.nd6 nc5 17.bc4 be6 18.bxe6 nxe6 19.kh1 nc5 20.e4 qe7 21.e5 f6 22.nd5 cxd5 23.qxd5+ ne6 24.f5 gxf5 25.nxf5 qf7 26.nd6 rad8 27.rad1 qd7 28.qb3 fxe5 29.rfe1 qe7 [0-1, granda zuniga julio e (per) 2475 - staniszewski piotr (pol) 2420, gausdal (norway) 1986]   para controlar los saltos de caballo. de7 y ce6 eliminará al últmo bastión, en el centro, para luego centralizar las torres. las negras deben estar mejor, pero aún queda mucho por delante.  apuntando al flanco de dama, la casilla c4 es un tema, así como doblar los peones en b3 para luego atarcarlos.    al fin. el juego desinteresado de juan, me permite lograr temas en el flanco de dama.    ¡ahí está! ahora la torre está atada a la defensa de un peón y las operaciones en el centro rendirán fruto, al doblarme en la columna d. aquí comencé a vislumbrar la posibildad de jugar af8, para ganar el peón de b3, pero antes de todo, es necesario librar a la dama negra de la defensa del peón a7. %02^013^010   misión cumplida. ahora las torres están dispuestas en el centro, nació una nueva debilidad en el dispositivo blanco (el peón e3) y ¡me toca! pensaba en f5, para fijar la debilidad, suponiendo que es lo que esperaba juan humire, para llevar algo de esperanza en un ataque sobre el flanco de rey... sin embargo, ya se podía el af8 que había pensado antes. ¿qué será mejor? en ese instante, evalué que, un peón es un peón. clara ventaja negra y nueva oportunidad para fijar los peones blancos en casillas negras, doblarme en la columna d y avanzar los peones del flanco de dama. ¿quién pensaría que un orden alterado sería tan grave? primero hice lo segundo...   fiel a su idea, juan humire sigue intentando llegar... aquí me daba cuenta que para progresar, necesitaba cambiar mi alfil por el caballo blanco... pero era la única pieza que defendía a mi rey. simplemente, menosprecién el contrajuego, debería estar incluido en los pecados capitales. ¡usted nunca lo haga!  tres peones libres en el flanco de dama y apunto de llegar a la séptima... aquí me puse a pensar... y me dí cuenta que las cosas no eran tan fáciles. el peón otrora debilidad en "e3" ahora se transforma en una ariete que amenaza abrir lineas en el flanco de rey. se amenaza con rayos x a la casilla f7, actuando como cortina el peón e6. entrando en el apuro de tiempo, no conseguí encontrar la respuesta.  sin nada más que hacer, felicité a juan por su incansable lucha en la búsqueda de contrajuego. merecido triunfo a mis ansias  de victoria desmedidas. ¡siempre hay que estar atento!

la defensa escandinava.  esta parte fue jugada con rapidez, yo tenía unos 20 minutos de retraso y se entiende que lucero quiera aprovecharlo. por otro lado, son movimientos conocidos. ahora la clavada en g4 es posible, pero en ese momento consideré que no era tan grave.  esto no me parece correcto. las negras retrasan su desarrollo y permiten abrir columnas centrales luego de un "d4". todavía era posible af5 con idea de e6, ae7, etc. atento, lucero busca apartar a su rey del centro las negras logran huir... por ahora. las negras conseguirán la igualdad si desarrollan su flanco de dama. las columnas abiertas y la dama expuesta son un tema para las blancas si db4; 11 a3, da5 (db2; 12 ca4 acaba con los paseos de la soberana) y me tienta la posibilidad de expansión sobre el flanco de dama. la continuación de la partida sigue manteniendo la pequeña ventaja de desarrollo limitando la actividad del alfil dama. al mantener mi caballo en d4, si bien mi dama no puede moverse, existe el desagradable cf5. por otro lado, comienzan a verse espectros sobre el flanco de dama. observen las diagonales tomadas por los alfiles... si tan solo el caballo no estuviera.. 11.., cbd7? 12 ac6 (si 12.., bc6; 13 cc6, de8; 14 te8) la variante da cuenta de los pequeñas oportunidades que brinda el desarrollo de las blancas. ahora en cambio, la dama podría tomar al caballo en c6. otra opción es 12 cc6, bc6; 13 ac6, tb8 y no me convence el cambio de "dos por una" (14 ab8, torre y dos peones contra caballo y alfil) tal vez si mis peones del flanco de dama estuvieran más avanzados, sería posible. te1 era más consecuente, pero era poner en sobre aviso a mi rival de mis intenciones. además, ab4 era perfectamente jugable.  ¿y ahora? el caballo de "c7" está tocado por el alfil, pero no funciona 13 ac6, bc6; 14 cc6 ya que después de 14.., de8; 15 ac7, dc6 y tenemos pieza por dos peones. ahora, 13 te8 se responde con 13.., ccd5 y las negras están vivas. algo debo hacer para aprovechar la centralización de mis piezas, sin cambiar "todo" porque el final se ve igualado, la estructura de peones negros es bien sana. si pudiese tomar la columna "d", la casilla d6 sería un buen aposento para los caballos. dos opciones entonces, 13 cb3 (para cambiar las damas y tomar la columna "d") o lo que hago en la partida ahora vislumbro la posibilidad de un "sacrificio estructural" por así llamarlo, permitir la captura en f4 a costa de la columna "g" y revolver las cosas en el flanco de rey. ¡la posición será muy sana si no lo hago! fue lo que pensé. existía otra alternativa... la jugada c4 está en camino, sacando al fortachón caballo de las negras.  ahí está, ahora los alfiles tienen algo que decir. si cf6, el sacrificio visto unas jugadas antes, para cambiar dos piezas por la torre, parece más prometedor, los peones avanzan rápidamente. propuesta de tablas: 16 dh5, g6; 17 ag6, hg6; 18 dg6 con jaque perpetuo (ahora me pena no haber tenido la torre en e1, con la posibilidad de un torre "e4" para llevarla a g4 o h4, si se pudiera, claro) vuelvo entonces a mi idea original, esta vez con algo más de debilidades en la estructura negra fíjense que las blancas mantienen las piezas para el sacrificio de "c6"... con la columna "g" semi abierta, es cosa de mover el rey blanco para apoyar el sacrificio en el flanco de rey, lucero se atrinchera. mantengo el encierro y busco nuevas aberturas por fin, mi dama se apresta a mirar "al lado" "¡oh no! ¡se viene el cambio de damas..." fue lo primero que pensé, pero... mirando con un poco más de detenimiento encontré.. ¿quién lo diría? la jugada 18, rg7 provoca la posibilidad de doblete en e6 por el caballo que no quise retroceder unas jugadas atrás. ¡siempre hay que estar atento! y no porque en una oportunidad no se pudo una combinación, olvidarla, tarde o temprano podría servir. clara ventaja blanca lucero rinde 
-------------------------------------
petroff's defence.  a fairly flexible system for black that i sometimes adopt to avoid going into the ruy lopez. the steinitz attack. at this point, it would be most common (and recommended) for black to pick up one of the pawns.  we'll see why shortly. white trades queens to ensure black can never castle.  an exposed king in a half-open centre is likely to cause trouble for black.  taking a pawn back at move 3, or allowing the pawn taken in move 4 to be gambitted, could have prevented a lot of black's trouble, with the capture being probably slightly better. black must scramble to prevent nxf7+!.  doing it this way also somewhat aids development. black could also have given some thought to nd7 to push away (or trade) the aggravating knight at e5 and taking him a step closer to connecting his rooks. a nice move for white that piles a little more pressure on black an exchange of minor pieces.  black opts to not double his pawns, at the expense of further exposing his king (although it should be relatively comfortable for the time being).  black's position is a little ragged, but for now he seems to be holding on reasonably well. black wins back the pawn he has been down for the last ten moves and is starting to coordinate against white's kingside.  after 11. f4 it is now white who is responding to threats; if black wants this to continue he will need to find a way to develop his rooks quickly and maintain the initiative. ? slightly uncertain.  the idea of countering an attack on the bishop with one on the rook is fine, but after 14. nxf4 bxd1 15. nxd1, black has traded two bishops for a rook, has no active pieces and his king is once again wide open.  perhaps 13. ... be5 was better, offering a trade, or bd6, a less active but more secure post that retains the useful bishop pair. as before, i prefer nxf4, with a white advantage, to a move that retains equality. black's bishop is forced back anyway.  he has probably come out the worse for the fight despite material equality, as most of his remaining army is stuck at home. the black king has been squeezed into a corner.  the white pieces are taking up strong positions in the black half of the board and are threatening to overwhelm the defenders in short order, due in no small part to black's failure to develop his queenside, which itself was a direct result of black allowing white to force a recapture by the black king back on move 5. black's development is hampered by his inability to bring out his queenside knight without disadvantage (either doubling his pawns via nc6 nxc6 bx6 or sticking it out of the action via na6).  this option, while providing no long-term advantage, does offer a threat on the e5 knight and the e4 pawn, but it seems unlikely snatching back pawns is going to offer serious hope for black with half of his remaining men sat at home while white's forces swarm. black takes a more aggressive line over initiating the knight trade, perhaps gaining by forcing the e2 knight to move. a counter-threat to the rook that disrupts black's plans to bring about attacks of his own using the tempo gained by forcing the knight to move. black now tries to initiate a rook trade, perhaps hoping that he can overpower white's knight with his bishop in a traded-down endgame. black hopes to sneak a back-rank mate, but this move offers little else to recommend it (the rook is slightly better placed here, but that's about it).  bd6 might have been better. black moves to the seventh to begin an attack on the white kingside pawns.  it will take him several moves to get behind and catch them. a good move that should give white plenty of opportunity to damage the black pawns and pull up a winning advantage, as black is about to have his bishop's protector stripped away. ?! black was in difficulties after 26. nd5, which this move does little to rectify.  he could instead have opted for bc5, but it doesn't do much better after 27. rxc7.  black just can't defend those pawns and will suffer for it. a petty check that acheives little and only delays the inevitable. with the idea of winning the c-pawn, but white's king guarantees black cannot win back his fallen pawns like this.  as it stands, barring a blunder from white, he's probably playing to draw now. activating the king. a wasted move, really, although forcing the white rook to move ensures no tempo is lost; black ought to be activating his own king and perhaps trying to mobilise his pawns as a counterthreat.  forcing the white rook towards the middle of the board does it no harm at all. ﻿temporarily protecting the a-pawn, but it will fall eventually.  black should be able to trade rooks and move his h-pawn down the board to queen first. ??  white offers a new threat to the pawn in place of the king, and black responds to it horribly. axb5 was much better. there really isn't much black can do now except try to pick up pawns while waiting for white to make a mistake.  the white king is comfortably sheltered by his pawns, the white rook can exert pressure on the black king, and black's position is overall weak.  he's lost the tempo he needed to win the promotion race. the game is now a race to see who can promote first.  white has a decisive advantage. black's rook takes up positions on the back rank, but it can't save him.  the time lost by having to move his rook away from the h-file is going to kill him off (if he wasn't already dead.)  white is more than happy to trade his b-pawn for black's rook. also effective was rc8, after which promotion cannot be stopped for more than one move. not that it matters, but ka8 isprobably the best move.

al termine della quarta partita caruana aveva previsto un risultato decisivo a breve, e oggi carlsen ha risolto il dubbio, su chi sarebbe stato l’autore del primo “score”! contrariamente a quanto temeva il gm gormally, magnus cambia apertura (1.c4) e costruisce in poche mosse una posizione che avrebbe presentato gli arrocchi eterogenei (a dire del norvegese con buone prospettive per il bianco), ma anand invita (13..ac7) carlsen ad entrare in un (quasi) finale leggermente favorevole, al prezzo di una prima semplificazione (cambio delle donne).  e carlsen accetta!  non ancora soddisfatto, anand “provoca” di nuovo (18..ab6) il norvegese prospettandogli la possibilità di semplificare ulteriormente la posizione ed entrare in un finale con quattro torri e l’alfiere del bianco palesemente (ma non decisamente) preferibile a quello del nero. il numero uno al mondo accetta di nuovo entrando in quello che, unanimemente, viene considerato il campo in cui eccelle più di ogni altro: saper sfruttare i piccoli vantaggi nei finali. alla fine anand, dopo 58 mosse, paga a caro prezzo le sue “provocazioni” ed è costretto all’abbandono dopo non essere stato in grado di difendere un finale difficile, ma che sembrava sostenibile. la prima vittoria nel match ha subito provocato molte reazioni. questo ci sembra il “tweet” decisamente più meritevole di essere citato:  tarrasch said, “before the endgame the gods have placed the middlegame.” sadly for anand, in the endgame the gods have placed carlsen!

-------------------------------------
.“carlsen gioca senza aperture, anand senza finali. statisticamente, questo è a favore di magnus!” così parlò ieri kasparov, e la sesta partita del mondiale 2013 gli ha dato ampiamente ragione! anand conferma la scelta per l’apertura di re, carlsen si affida di nuovo alla berlinese ed il campione del mondo gioca 4.d3. i due giocatori seguono la anand-aronian del memorial alekhine 2013, finché anand gioca la novità 10.ag5. carlsen riflette per 20’ e risponde con 10..ae6. i motori si “eccitano” (e con loro gli spettatori) e danno +0,60 al bianco (con 11.axe3 seguita da d4). anand, dopo 10’, preferisce la “normale” cbd2. la partita prosegue senza particolari emozioni ed entra in un finale di pezzi pesanti, valutato da praticamente tutti gli autorevoli commentatori di questo match sostanzialmente pari ma … carlsen, proponendo ad anand grattacapi sempre più complessi (ed in questo il numero uno al mondo ha un talento fantastico!), con una delle sue “magie” riesce a vincere portandosi avanti nel match con un doriguardo il finale, oggi abbiamo deciso di far parlare (tramite i loro tweet pubblicati nel corso della partita) solo gm con la “serie” anche i grandi maestri si chiedono: perché? jonathan rowson, subito dopo la decisione di anand di cedere il primo pedone con 38.dg3: “can anybody explain why vishy blundered a pawn?” hikaru nakamura: “can someone tell me why anand eschewed 51.b3 which led to a theoretical draw?” (questa la breve linea che secondo nakamura conduce alla patta teorica: 51.b3 te3+ 52.rh2 txc3 53.bxc4) per concludere, e per la serie “i gm rispondono”, segnaliamo invece quest’altro “tweet”, sempre di nakamura: ”i know people say 60.b4 was a draw, but i am not sure anyone would have found it in that situation.“ so che le persone dicono che 60.b4 era patta. ma non sono sicuro che chiunque l’avrebbe trovata in questa situazione. domani è previsto il terzo giorno di riposo, dopodiché anand avrà di nuovo il bianco (nella settima partita del match i colori si invertono). (da www.scacchierando.it) . . . anand comincia con e4, una mossa chiaramente d'attacco.   . . . siamo, come nella 4a partita, tornati alla ruy lopez. . . . . . . . . . questa mossa, se il nero risponde con 8...b5 9.bb3 d6 ci porta ad una ruy lopez chiusa.  generalmente il nero mira ad un vantaggioso ... d5. il bianco mira invece allo sviluppo con nbd2-f1-g3  . . . in queste posizioni è uno svantaggio avere l' alfiere nero attivo confinato in c5 e non e7 , il cavallo f6 viene bloccato. anand ha giocato contro aronian all'inizio di quest'anno al memorial alekhine  10.nbd2 invece di ag5 . la partita si è conclusa con un pareggio senza troppi problemi per il nero. uno dei piani del nero potrebbero essere  di giocare rb8 seguito da b4 e guadagnare un certo vantaggio sul lato di donna . magnus sfida il forte alfiere bianco, una risposta tipica in queste posizioni. dopo a4 il bianco mira a creare un punto debole per il nero in b5.  . . il nero può giocare bb6 solo se il bianco muove d4. di norma prendendo l'alfiere in e6 il bianco deve avere qualche idea concreta. fare lo scambio di alfieri senza un guadagno posizionale è solo controproducente. . fino a qui l'apertura ha seguito le linee standard. unico svantaggio per il bianco: ha dei pedoni doppiati: b2+b3. il piano di axb3 bianco potrebbe essere nd2f1 e quindi ne3 mentre quello del nero di  ottenere di comandare il gioco sul lato di donna con a5 - a4 o una spinta al centro con d5 molto interessante idea da magnus , vuole riorganizzarsi con nbd7 , così da poter uscire dal blocco dell'alfiere? poteva giocare anche: 13... a5 14. nf1 il bianco necessita attenuare la pressione sul lato di re. nh2  e successivamente ng4 è la combinazione più giusta. .. . de7, l' idea è quella di rispondere g4 con qe6 . dopo uno scambio di alfieri, la regina in e6 è in una posizione ottimale. mossa per raggiungere g3/e3 e infine nf5 . il nero dopo essere uscito dalla scomoda posizione, ha due modi per continuare:d5 o a5 e successivamente bb6 una mossa che permette di continuare con a5 e liberare la torre in a8 e rafforzare il gioco della donna. una continuazione con 17.ne3 a5 18.nf5 qe6 19.ng4 kh7 appare pericolosa per il nero , anche se non dovrebbe esserci alcun problema reale. il nero dovrebbe giocare quanto prima qe6. kh7 è una mossa importane nel caso di eventuali sacrifici in h6 . . un invito al nero di giocare a5 e così eliminare il pedone doppiato. . . bxa5: il nero sta giocando nel giusto modo, anche se la mossa del bianco nf5, potrebbe dargli qualche grattacapo. il nero è comunque pronto in questo caso, a muovere d5, realizzando finalmente l'intento che insegue da molte mosse, esempio 20.nf5 bb6 21.ng4 rxa1 22.nxf6+ nx6 23.qxa1 d5.  . . una mossa sorprendente. ora, se la regina, dopo una serie di scambi, riesce a raggiungere f6, il bianco non può muovere il cavallo e3 perché il pf2 rimarrebbe senza protezione. . . . un bel gioco, anche se non saprei scegliere tra queste due combinazioni: 23 ... be3 24fe3 de7 seguito da c6 e 23. qe2 ( se il bianco invece di qg4 avesse optato per questa continuazione) bxe3 24. qxe3 c5 . . il re bianco è più al sicuro  . magnus minaccia c4. a mio vedere, in questo momento, il nero gioca per la patta. . con questa spinta il nero guadagna spazio e fa pressione sul bianco. consideravo, in un primo momento, 27.d4 una mossa sbagliata, ma guardando meglio (e per questo ho potuto postare le mie valutazioni solo un giorno dopo la partita ;-)) ho notato che con 27 ... exd4 28.exd4 rxa1 29.rxa1 avrebbe permesso al nero la conseguente riconquista del pedone. tuttavia, a questo punto, la partita si sarebbe avviata verso un altro pareggio . un'altra alternativa interessante per il nero è: 27 ... b4 e se 28.cxb4 rab8 29.ra4 e ora exd4 30.exd4 qe4. . qb7 minaccia ... exd4 . se il bianco muove 29.d5, il nero può continuare con rb8 con l'idea b4 queste posizioni sono esattamente quelle che piacciono maggiormente a carlsen.  29 ... exd4 30.rxd4 rxe6 danno vantaggio, anche se non decisivo, al nero. carlsen è  comunque conosciuto per vincere partendo da posizioni che sembravano impossibili. forse troppo docile il gioco di anand, comunque non era visibilmente in possesso dell'agressività che serve per vincere. . . . il nero ha un pedone arretrato: d6  il nero minaccia di guadagnare materiale: te5xf5  l'idea di qf3 del bianco è quella di rispondere a 32 ... f5 con qd1 il bianco può giocare rd5, ma la sua struttura pedonale è inferiore a quella del nero, al quale però, non è sufficiente per vincere. . la partita sembra avviarsi verso una patta. anche se la struttura del bianco è migliore, è difficile con queste posizioni, immaginare la vittoria di uno dei due contendenti. anand sembra quasi mirare al pareggio per prendersi un giorno di meditazione prima della ripresa dei combattimenti... ma queste cose, specialmente se si gioca contro carlsen, sarebbe meglio non prenderle mai in considerazione. . . . ora il bianco è bloccato ed il nero può cominciare a sviluppare i propri pezzi con kg7 e h5. anche se, e lo ripeto, personalmente a questo punto, è ancora difficile vedere un'idea di base dove costruire la vittoria per il nero. . . . . . . . 2 al prezzo di uno . siamo davanti ad un finale di torre e con un pedone in + che, per il nero, vuol dire molto.  . . . . . . . non è un sacrificio vero. il nero, con i pedoni doppiati, dimezza la sua forza nella linea h. . . . comincia la manovra tb7-b6-e6-e4  . . . . . la torre nera è ben piazzata.  . . . . . . .  l'idea è te4-f4-g4-g3  . . . . . . . un finale nettamente superiore per il nero. il bianco minaccia di guadagnare materiale: tc8xc4  . . . qui forse è l'errore decisivo per il bianco. la mossa migliore in questa situazione era rb4 . . fino a prima dell'errore ra4 anand ha avuto il pieno controllo sulla situazione. ora però la situazione sembra sfuggirgli di mano. infatti dopo 62 . ra7 f3 63 . re7+ kf2 64 . h4 rg2+ 65 . rh3 kf1 66 . ra7 rg6 67 . h5 rg5 68 . ra6 f2 69 . rxh6 kg1 70 . rf6 rxh5 + porta a frutto un altro finale di partita a favore di carlsen. .62. ra8 si rendeva necessaria  praticamente la partita è finita. carlsen ha tirato fuori il classico coniglio dal capello e, approfittando di tanti piccoli errori di anand, una posizione vincente. . . . . . . . . 67. ra1 (non migliora alcunché) re6 68. ra7 re1 69. rf7+ ke3  (67... rg1 68. rf8+ ke3 69. re8+ kd4 70. rd8+ kxc4) e' la mossa migliore. ora la minaccia inevitabile per il bianco è di f2 in "underpromotion" . anand abbandona. ora ci troviamo con 2 punti di vantaggio per carlsen e una grande vittoria per il norvegese.  
-------------------------------------
uno laconico anand, con i bianchi, ha giocato questa scialba partita come si trovasse ad una visita dentistica. una cosa veloce e più indolore possibile... con questa mancanza di mordente, e accettare la ruy lopez per l'ennesima volta lo dimostra, vedo poche possibilità di successo finale per l'indiano. con cinque o sei, conforme l'andamento, partite ancora da giocare, ad eccezione di un colpo di sonno di carlsen e una superdose di adrenalina per anand, le cose difficilmente cambieranno. la partita, per se, non merita molti commenti. carlsen, con logico interesse, l'ha tenuta più piatta possibile. un irriconoscibile anand non ha fatto nulla per vincerla. speriamo che per domani abbia intenzioni migliori... . . . . . . . . il nero ha la copia di alfieri. . impedisce la cattura di nf3xe5 se 6... be6 7. o-o ( se 7. nxe5 qd4 8. o-o qxe5) . . forse un po' di aggressività con 8. nc4 nd7 non avrebbe guastato sarebbe stato meglio svegliare la regina e portarla in gioco 8... qd6 9. ng3 . . . protegge f5+h5 . . forse un arrocco eterogeneo avrebbe cambiato il lato d'attacco e anche il gioco: 12. o-o o-o-o  . . . . consolida c5 . . . . . . . 19... rh8 20. a3  altra continuazione possibile: 19. f3 f5, cercando di indebolire il centro. i due pedoni in e4 e e5 sono un muro. ma a quanto pare, nessuno dei due ha voglia di tirare fuori gli artigli. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27... qxf5 $2 28. qxf5 gxf5 29. nd4 . e uno . . . e due . . . terza ripetizione. brutta partita da parte dello spettacolo, ma, prendendo a riferimento i database, perfetta. una torta perfetta... senza zucchero. 
-------------------------------------
dopo l’apertura di re di carlsen, per un attimo gli spettatori hanno provato un sussulto augurandosi che anand, sotto di due punti, sfoderasse una siciliana. ma la speranza di un duello rusticano è scemata dopo la risposta simmetrica dell'indiano, e si è definitivamente spenta quando quest'ultimo ha deciso di evitare anche un duello al primo sangue, ‘sfoderando’ la berlinese. a quel punto i giocatori si sono “virtualmente” stretti la mano agevolando in poche mosse il cambio di tutti i pezzi, e la partita è terminata con una patta dopo 33 mosse, con la posizione finale a fare da rappresentazione plastica dell’impotenza del campione (da www.scacchierando.it) . . . . altra variante; 3... nd4 4. nxd4 exd4 5. o-o  . variante secondaria 4... bc5 5. nxe5 nxe5 6. d4 $14   5. d4 be7 6. re1 nd6 7. bxc6 dxc6 8. dxe5 nf5 $14  . . . . . . . il nero ha una posizione ristretta. l'alfiere in c8 è completamente bloccato.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . controlla b5  . . . . . . . . alternative variation: 21. qe3 qe7 $11  . . . . . . . . . . il nero minaccia di dare matto  . . . . . 9... ke7 30. kf2  . 30... kd7 31. ke3  31. ke2 kd7  . . . . .

come tutti gli chiedevano, anand cambia apertura passando a 1.d4 e, come tutti speravano, imposta una linea della nimzo-indiana aggressiva e tagliente ma carlsen si difende da par suo (e cioè alla perfezione!) fino all’errore del campione del mondo (28.cf1?),  che lo sfidante punisce immediatamente portando a casa la terza vittoria (a zero) nel match. il numero uno al mondo si avvicina così, in sole 28 mosse, a mezzo punto (da ottenere in tre partite!) dal naturale congiungimento con la corona mondiale! l’andamento di questa partita ci spiega forse il perché del comportamento di anand nei due precedenti incontri. probabilmente, e i fatti gli hanno dato ragione, l’indiano non si sentiva in grado di affrontare “carlsen-houdini” in una battaglia tattica.  in conferenza stampa si è poi visto un anand inaspettatamente (visto il grave errore) rilassato, quasi che il campione del mondo si sia sentito, finalmente, liberato dal dovere di provare a difendere un titolo ormai divenuto troppo “pesante”.  . . . . . consolida e4+g4 altra variante: 4. nf3 nc6  oppure: 4... c5 5. a3 ba5 6. dxc5 bxc3+ 7. bxc3  . . . altra variante 6... o-o 7. e3  si poteva anche giocare: 7. e3 o-o  . . l'alfiere bianco ha una posizione ristretta e passiva  .  l'idea è cb8-c6-a5-b3  . altra continuazione possibile 10... na5 11. bg2  era buono anche: 11. nf4 ne8  il cavallo bianco è malintenzionato . il nero minaccia di guadagnare materiale: cb3xa1. una casa molto attiva per il cavallo nero.  anand, nonostante la veemenza iniziale, sembra molto impacciato. carlsen poteva giocare anche: 13... bd7 14. e4  perché non giocare : 14. a4 bxa4 15. rxa4 h6 ?   . un attacco affrettato. . il bianco mina la catena di pedoni  il cavallo è arrivato a segno. comunque c'era l'alternativa di giocare: 16... nc7 17. be3  . . il bianco conquista maggior spazio un'altra possibilità era: 18. f4 dxe4 19. nxe4 rb6  . il bianco incrementa il suo attacco togliendo lo sguardo da quanto sta succedendo sul lato di donna. . . . . uno scambio tutto a favore del nero che si trova, come nelle partite vinte in precedenza, con un pedone in più nel lato più debole della scacchiera. anand sperava di sorprendere carlsen con questo massiccio attacco di pedoni. sul blog sono subito apparsi messaggi tipo, "oggi carlsen di becca lo scacco matto" ecc. ma, secondo me, per l'ennesima volta, anand ha sottovalutato carlsen. e' fatta, ora il nero ha un nuovo pedone passato protetto: b3  meglio era: 23. nh5 nc7  il cavallo nero corre in aiuto. tutto dipende da lui, e nelle mosse successive ce ne accorgeremo. . controlla f5+h5 un'altra possibile mossa era: 24... gxf6 25. nh5 ne8 26. gxf6 $15  secondo me la regina ha fatto molto male a isolarsi in un attacco non studiato a puntino. ecco la cavalleria, senza di essa il bianco avrebbe vinto. forse era meglio giocare: 26. ne2 qa5 27. nf4 be6 28. nxe6 fxe6  il pedone se ne va perché non giocare: 27. ne2 qa5 28. nf4 be6 (28... qxc3 29. nxd5 qxd4+ 30. kh1 qxd5 31. bxd5) 29. nxe6 fxe6 ?  il nero si è costruito un harem pessima mossa: 28. bf1 era molto meglio, seguita da qd1 29. rh4  anand abbandona. la sua sorte è segnata, dopo: 28... qe1 29. rh4 qxh4 30. qxh4 qa5 il finale per il nero è vincente. una partita difficile da spiegare. l'indiano nel momento più decisivo della partita ha fatto l'errore più madornale, quasi come quello che successe a hubner nelle eliminatorie di abano terme credo nel 1979.

-------------------------------------
superando nettamente (6,5-3,5) viswanathan anand, il 22 novembre 2013 magnus carlsen diventa il sedicesimo campione del mondo, titolo raggiunto con una precocità seconda solo a quella di kasparov! considerando solo i campioni del mondo “classici”.  carlsen ha conquistato il titolo a 8 giorni di distanza dal suo 23° compleanno con cinque mesi (per la precisione 147 giorni) di ritardo rispetto a kasparov (campione a 22 anni e 210 giorni). se consideriamo anche l’infelice stagione dei mondiali ko fide, il record di precocità spetta invece a ponomariov (18 anni e 106 giorni), record che molto probabilmente resterà imbattuto ancora a lungo.  dopo aver respinto gli assalti di kramnik, topalov e gelfand, alla quarta difesa ‘vishy’ cede dunque la corona allo ‘yankee’ che viene dalla norvegia. carlsen ha spazzato via senza particolari difficoltà le presunte insidie che molti pensavano avrebbe dovuto affrontare nel suo primo match, facendo invece pesare tutti i suoi 95 punti elo in più. secondo molti, oggi inizia di una “nuova era” fatta di “giocatori al silicio”, quasi privi di anima e di passione per il bel gioco ma “acrobaticamente” freddi e precisi. noi la pensiamo diversamente. “mozart” e “macchina” degli scacchi sono appellativi già attribuiti, quasi  100 anni fa, ad un altro campione del mondo, jose raul capablanca, anche lui osannato per il suo gioco preciso, naturale e senza rischi, anche lui criticato per gli stessi identici motivi! non molto di nuovo sembra dunque scorrere sulle 64 caselle … passando al campione detronizzato, dopo un inizio che aveva lasciato ben sperare (sull’incertezza del match) anand è stato surclassato da carlsen che, oltre a vincere tre partite, ha sempre dato l’impressione di essere in pieno controllo della situazione. questo risultato, deludente per chi si aspettava un match più equilibrato, non può però incrinare la figura del quindicesimo campione del mondo che, è bene ricordarlo, è stato tale per oltre 6 anni! prima di concludere, rivolgiamo una “preghiera” al nuovo campione del mondo perché non privi gli appassionati dell‘ultra-centenaria tradizione dei match mondiali. in passato, carlsen ha dichiarato di preferire un torneo al match, che a suo avviso concede troppi privilegi al campione in carica. la speranza è che il norvegese cambi idea e perciò  lo abbiamo “consacrato” xvi campione del mondo, perché senta la responsabilità di portare una corona che è stata di steinitz, lasker, capablanca, alechine, euwe, botvinnik, smyslov, tal, petrosjan, spassky, fischer, karpov, kasparov, kramnik e anand. in cambio, vi garantiamo sin d’ora che non lo criticheremo per aver cambiato idea!  . . . . altra variante 3... bd7 4. qe2  . . . . altra variante della siciliana: 6. bc4 ngf6 ma a quanto pare carlsen vuol forzare il gioco e non perderne l'iniziativa.   . altra variante: 7. nc3 e5 8. qd5 qc7 e' mia impressione che carlsen, anche se è presto da dire, vuole tenere sotto pressione anand. con questa tattica pensa di raggiungere almeno una patta, e con essa  il campionato del mondo.  alfiere f8 è ancora inattivo. preferibile era : 7... rc8 8. o-o  . il nero poteva cominciare a ridimensionare la pressione del bianco con : 8... qa5+ 9. nc3 bg4 10. bxf6 gxf6 11. nd2  . . . . era possibile anche : 11. rad1 rc8   . . . il nero ha una posizione troppo compatta. la pressione del bianco ha effetto. variante: 13. f3 bd7  . . una mossa debole anche se la cattura di pedone avrebbe causato un indebolimento nel lato di regina... e anand ha imparato a sue spese che a carlsen questo vantaggio è meglio non darlo. la linea c deve essere rinforzata . . . mossa debole. consigliabile: 17. f3 rfe8  la linea d è sotto controllo da parte di ambedue i giocatori. . . tutti sulla d una mossa attesa da tante mosse, anche se a questo punto poteva giocare: 19... bg5 20. rb1  . . oppure: 21. rc2 b5 22. cxb5 axb5  un buon modo per perdere un tempo prezioso. probabilmente anand è molto indeciso. . . . . . non era il momento di forzare lo scambio: 24... be5 25. re3 sarebbe stato più incisivo.  . altra possibilità: 25... nc5 26. re3 b6 27. qc2  torna a rafforzare la linea d una mossa telecomandata . altra possibilità: 27... g5 28. f4 gxf4 29. nxf4  buona mossa mossa debole. migliore alternativa era: 28... kh7  29.e4-e5 nf6-e8 30. ne2-c3 rc8-c6 31.b3-b4 rd7-d8 32.f2-f4 qg5-e7 33.f4-f5 qe7-c7 34.c4-c5 d6-d5 35.re3-e1 kg8-h7 36.f5-f6 g7-g6 37.nc3-a4 h6-h5 38.na4-b6 kh7-g8 39.qd2-g5 rd8-b8 40.re1-d1 ed il nero avrebbe potuto sperare di giocare ancora  . ora sappiamo perché 26. ... nf6 era debole. brutta mossa di carlsen. avrebbe dovuto giocare 30.ne2-c3 rc8-c6 31.b3-b4 rd7-d8 32.f2-f4 qg5-e7 33.f4-f5 qe7-c7 34.c4-c5 d6-d5 35.re3-e1 rd8-d7 36.f5-f6 h6-h5 37.f6xg7 ne8xg7 38.qd2-f4 qc7-d8 39.re1-d1 ng7-f5 40.nc3xd5 rd7xd5 41.rd4xd5 e6xd5  anche: 30. nc3 rc8-c6 31.f2-f4 qg5-d8 32.re3-d3 rc6xd6 33. rd4xd6 rd7xd6 34.rd3xd6 qd8xd6 35.qd2xd6 ne8xd6 36.kg1-f2 kg8-f8 37.ne2-c1 g7-g5 38.nc1-d3 kf8-e7 39.kf2-e3 nd6-f5+ 40.ke3-e4 f7-f6 41.f4xg5 h6xg5 42. nd3-c5 nf5-d6+ 43.ke4-e3 nd6-f5+  avrebbe reso la vita molto più facile al bianco  il nero minaccia di guadagnare materiale: tc6xd6  . . tutti sulla d!!

-------------------------------------
nella prima partita con l’insolita apertura del „fianchetto grünfeld“ ,un carlsen timoroso ha cercato di mettere in difficoltà un tranquillo anand che, alla fine, è riuscito a mettere in difficoltà lo sfidante. carlsen, alla fine, ha preferito optare per una parità che, a quanto riportato dai media, ha reso felice anche anand, per il quale, una patta con il nero, vale qualcosa di più del punteggio effettivo. a mio parere, questa prima partita, come quasi tutte le prime partite delle sfide mondiali,  può essere considerata solo uno studio reciproco in attesa di affilare le armi al momento giusto. qualitativamente una partita piatta giocata con schemi ben conosciuti e dai quali, nessuno dei due contendenti, ha preferito uscire.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in tutte queste continuazioni tratte da partite dove è stata giocata questa apertura, si nota come il risultato finale non poteva essere altro che quello sortito.

-------------------------------------
simple move, yet b&w are at a quite equal stage of development. titi chose the modern defense. there is not much theory written about it yet. to be honest, i don´t really care if there is. wurscht. standard development, played very often in the db. nearly 9 times more 2.d4 is played, what is called norwegian defense. fritzi bets on developing his knights first. i would do so as well. der figurentausch bxn pxn would double white´s pawns but that wouldn´t matter because white had a better development and a center-pawn. occupying the center and threatening 5.d5. first i wondered why not d5 but a second later i realized why not. i think it is not necessary to explain. this situation appears in the db only 2 times: win/loss rate: 50/50 but fritz calculates a little advantage for himself. ? a open f-file is ever good for your king´s defense. also it blocks the 2nd bishop´s diagonal. (at least i think so. if somebody disagree feel free to add a comment.) ! sending his bishop back where he´s coming from.
-------------------------------------
  preparing for the long rochade (castling), what brings his queen´s rook in. and gives white a strong pair of bishops, which hold their position up to the 19th move. also wants to castle. whithout the pawns on f7 and g7 i would have decided for the long castling.
-------------------------------------
  also good may have been 12...bc6 what threatens g2 after 13.e5 dxe5 14.fxe5 nd5 15.nxd5 b(or q)xd5 or, if not 15.nxd5 threatens changing on e3. 12...d5, good as well. everything better than what is happening now: the much better variation for white because of: ! forced? with rf7 he could protect but then follows 17.rhf1. winning material. you dont have to be a gm to predict who is about to win. attacking b7 not bad, but he forgot that after the exchange there is still the attack on b7 and c7 is uncovered... ! ties the rook to the h-file because 25....ra4 26.rh7  kg8 bd5  . this will be very important later on. so what? after that he will have to go back to f8 in order to avoid checkmate.that just loses a tempo and helps the king coming out of his hole. attacking a4 is not bad cause the rook, as we know, can´t get away from his h. uuh, i bet that made fritz very scared.. ! still remember what i said about his h-rook? !great. the b8 rook is only able to leave his 8th reihe giving check, and then has to return again. so he cannot kill b2 and cannot prevent the king attacking. now, there is a chance to take on b2 but this would lose a rook - or the game. ! fritz calculates a mate in 16 or something (can´t remember how much, maybe 11 or 18..) but it went faster. ähä.. why not g5? ! why not g5? ! why not g5? ! es hätt eh vorher auch nix gebracht. trotzdem hatter drei tempos verbraucht mit denen er das matt vl ein paar züge rauszögern hätte können. technically resigned. fritz turned out to be better than chess titans on his highest level, quod erat demonstrandum.
-------------------------------------
this game ends in one of my extremely rare draws. both sides had chances but in the end it was obviously a draw. one of my favorite anti sicilian lines against better players, less likely to focus on book knowledge. an attempt to exploit whites having blocked nc3. otherwise black gets control of the center and an active q. the pawn is isolated but white has compensation in development potential. ?! up to this point, book. here gk suggests  7...qf5 8. d5 bxf3 9. gxf3 ne5 10. bb5+ nd7 11. be3 ngf6 12. rc1 a6 13. bd3 qh5 14. o-o nxd5 15. nxd5 qxd5 with only a slight edge for white. gk prefers 8. d5 ne5 9. bb5+ bd7 10. bxd7+ nxd7 11. o-o ngf6 12. bg5 qb4 13. qc2 nc5 14. rfe1 o-o-o 15. ne5 nxd5 16. qf5+ kb8 17. nxd5 rxd5, rating white +1.25. but i was concerned about the pin. ?! gk considers this an error, suggesting 11 … qb8 12. nfd4 bd7 13. bd3 nxd4 14. nxd4 bd6 15. re1+ ne4 16. qh5 o-o 17. qxd5 nc5 18. bc4 bxh2+ 19. kh1 when the game is essentially even, i was feeling good about my prospects here. white has an advantage, but can i keep it? this move was in the gk world database, and i liked the resulting position.  so far, this position is still in the gk world database, and it shows white as having the advantage.  it turns out black's king is not a weak as i would have thought. unexpectedly strong. i thought that with the broken pawn structure black would fear the ending. but that was not the case. again, i wanted to get to an ending. ! very effective. while white has to be better (as gk computer indicates), black has become slightly more active than white.  necessary to free the rook and block play on the a file. well played. as weak as black's pawns look, i am not able to see how to make much progress. ?! this is too timid. rd3 is better. i thought i could play in later but black is becoming more active. a fine move! black is using activity to compensate for pawn weaknesses. i keep thinking that putting pressure on the d pawn will help me find a plan. ?! gk does not like this move. it suggests … d4 27. rc2 qe7 28. rf1 kg7 29. h3 rd5 30. b4 ree5 31. g3 b5 32. rfc1 re1+ 33. rxe1 qxe1+ 34. kh2, further cramping white's position, with essential equality.  but it works psychologically, since i am playing more cautiously, and fear ...rg4 if i play qg3+, thus the proactive h3. instead of this move, after which white has no real advantage, gk suggests 27. qg3+ kh8 28. f3 re5 29. qh4 f6 30. a4 rc6 31. a5 rc4 32. qh6 rc8 33. g3 qc6 34. f4 qc5+ 35. rd4, with advantage to white.  again, i still think i have a won ending. while i do have an advantage, it isn't as great as i thought. ! a good plan. keeping white out. now i am still struggling for a plan to win rather than draw, at the obvious risk of losing. i thought i could mobilize my q side pawn majority.  this is the beginning of an aggressive plan. i knew rooks belong behind pawns but had visions of infiltrating on the q side. ? gk considers this a blunder. i still have the advantage, and had a flawed idea that i could advance the pawns now and then get behind a passed pawn with my rook. but gk suggests first 39. g3 rc8 40. ke3 rg8 41. rb4 rxg3 42. kd4 rxh3 43. rxb6+ ke7 44. kxd5 rxf3 45. b4 h5 46. a5 rd3+ 47. ke5 h4 48. kxf5 rd5+ 49. ke4. the point is that it is a move order issue, white could prepare in order to be able to move the k. ? ironically the best move a move ago, gk considers this weak because it gives black too much play. if i was going to proceed with my plan i needed to be bold and play consistently with 40. a5 rxg2 41. axb6 rg8 42. b5 rb8 43. ke3 rxb6 44. rb4 kd6 45. kd4 rb7 46. rb3 rb6 47. f4 h5, with some advantage. now black has full equality, perhaps a very slight edge. but white still is trying for a win.  this move does not help white but it is an attempt to win (or lose). ? the king isn't going anywhere. i was trying too hard to win. gk suggests 48. kf3 ra3+ 49. ke2 ke5 50. rh4 d4 51. rh7 rg3 52. rh6 d3+ 53. kd2 rxg5 54. rxb6 ke4 55. a5 rg2+ 56. kc3 rc2+ 57. kb3 ke3 with drawish prospects. again another overaggressive plan, which risks losing a drawish game. best is simply 52. rf6+ kc5 53. rc6+ kb4 54. rxb6 kxa4 55. rb8 rg6 56. kf4 ka5 57. ke5 rb6 58. ra8+ kxb5 59. kxd5 rh6 60. ra1 rh5+ 61. ke6 rh6+ 62. kd5.  ? here black misses a possible win with … rg3+ 54. kf4 ra3 55. rc7+ kb4 56. ke5 kxa4 57. kxd5 kxb5 58. rc2 rd3+ 59. ke4 rd1 60. rc7 rd2 61. ke3 ra2 62. rd7 rc2 63. rb7 rc1. again, white has played too much for a win. a move later, white has better defensive prospects. white is now struggling to draw.  ? but this does not help. gk suggests after 60. kd3 rb3+ 61. kc2 rxb5 62. rc8+ kd4 63. ra8 rb7 64. ra6 rc7+ 65. kd2 rg7 66. ra4+ ke5 67. ra8 rg2+ 68. kd3 rg3+ 69. kd2 d4 70. ra7. a similar plan, with 60. kc3 rxb5 61. rc8+ kd6 62. rd8+ ke7 63. ra8 rb1 64. ra6 rd1 65. rg6 kd7 66. rh6 kc7 67. rh8 rb1 68. rf8 kc6 69. rf7 rb7 70. rxb7, offers excellent drawing prospects.  !? this is essentially a concession the game will be drawn. ! now white has a draw but they have to play carefully. the rest of the ending is instructive for beginners on how to draw despite being down a pawn from this kind of position. both players play it out for that purpose. always maintain the opposition, if the king ever gets in front of the pawn it will queen. the right move, black must now protect the pawn. again, maintain the opposition.  once again black must retreat or advance the pawn. white is maintaining the opposition.  black can't make progress. advances the pawn, and the same pattern repeats itself. the key move. white can oppose black's king.  only way to progress, but... now the game is declared drawn. either black stalemates or loses the pawn, a draw in either case. moral of the game for beginners is if you are too aggressive in trying to win, you risk fighting for a draw at best. also instructive for beginners is how black compensated for pawn structure weaknesses that were not as severe as one would think with activity. a draw was a fitting result.

-------------------------------------
depois dessa partida descobri que esse deixa o preto igualar fácil. em uma partida de treinamento contra o disconzi foi jogado uma posição similar, mas aqui segui seu conselho e montei uma estrutura maróczy, que parece a melhor chance de obter alguma vantagem no meio-jogo. alternative variation: 6. d5  não há outro lance para tentar crescer. em posições comuns a dama está em d1, dando suporte ao cavalo e permitindo algum lance de desenvolvimento.  talvez um plano mais frutífero fosse vagar essa casa para o bispo e dobrar na coluna 'd', pressionando a fraqueza em d6. o negro resolve o problema de espaço com os temáticos cf6-d7 e f7-f5.  15...f5 não é oportuno por enquanto. alternative variation: 15... f5 16. exf5 rxf5 17. bg4  um lance equivocado. se eu estivesse mais seguro teria jogado b2-b4, mas não sabia se valia a pena enfraquecer c4 para expandir na ala da dama também.  ameaçando 17...cd3  não há outra maneira razoável de defender sem deixar o negro melhorar sua posição.  empate por repetição.  
-------------------------------------
mais normal seria 5.c4, e totalmente de acordo com as possíveis transposições.  definindo a forma como vai abordar o centro.  o negro se empenha em combater no centro, o que deve mesmo ser o melhor a fazer aqui. chega a parecer que, no momento em que a posição abrir um pouco, o ch3 se tornará ainda mais bobo, mas na verdade ele será a peça mais importante por um tempo.  apesar dos peões móveis no centro, o branco tem sucesso no bloqueio destes. além do mais, o bispo de casas brancas do negro torna-se um mal crônico. a pressão com peças no centro é eficiente o bastante para render uma vantagem duradoura ao branco, ao estilo nimzowitch.  trocando um dos defensores das casas negras.  as peças brancas, especialmente o cd3 e o bg2, harmonizam sutilmente para manter as possibilidades do negro sob controle. uma partida clássica muito instrutiva com esse mesmo tema é nimzowitch - salwe, karlsbad 1911.  o preto não tem muito o que fazer e espera uma oportunidade. é uma boa política nesse tipo de posição: aceitar que não dá pra criar plano ativo e organizar lentamente as peças, provocando o adversário a se precipitar.  o preto prepara contra-jogo após cd8-c6-a5-c4, a7-a5 e b7-b5-b4.  reorganizando para pressionar os peões frontalmente da forma mais ajustável ao plano do preto, que eu felizmente percebi após 26...cc6  a posição do preto finalmente começa a ruir.  mais forte é 34.dc5!  o branco começa uma estratégia de dominação. o objetivo é forçar trocar as damas quando o negro não puder suportar a pressão e ganhar o final bispo x cavalo com peão a mais.  um lance ansioso ... melhor é apertar um pouco mais com 41.dd4! o branco pode forçar a troca praticamente quando quiser.  parece um erro de cálculo, mas eu duvido que seja esse o caso em se tratando de um jogador como o marcão. é bem provável que ele tenha imaginado que a posição resultante fosse mesmo difícil de ganhar.  começando a marcha que supostamente deveria decidir a partida.  aproveitando a superioridade do bispo sobre o cavalo.  alternative variation: 55... nxa3 56. bd3  deixando passar 60.bg6! seguido de f4-f5, que fecha logo a questão.  alternative variation: 62... kxh7 63. kf6+ kg8 64. bc4  em vários momentos o bispo se aproveita da dominação sobre o cavalo para forçar o preto a gastar mais tempos.  mais uma vez, 67.bg6! e 68.f5 era o melhor.  sempre optando pelo caminho mais díficil... apesar de estar convicto sobre a correção do plano, ceguei várias alternativas mais simples. alternative variation: 70. f5 kxh7 71. f6+ kh8 72. f7 kg7 73. kxa5  é impressionante a resistência demonstrada pelo marcão. mesmo depois do sufoco no meio-jogo, do final "tecnicamente perdido" até aqui ele continua me obrigando a mostrar que sou capaz de ganhar. posso apostar que ele já salvou vários pontos assim.  tecnicamente falando é um final de ganho fácil, mas exige um pouquinho de astúcia.  alternative variation: 89. qg4   
-------------------------------------
um experimento. fazia um tempo a catalã vinha me causando problemas difíceis de resolver.  mais forte é 6...bc6 ou 6...c5!?  melhor é 10...cc6 (desenvolvendo uma peça!). é impressionante o número de vezes que lances fáceis e efetivos fogem da nossa percepção enquanto complicamos coisas simples.  uma formação conveniente, mas me incomodava a falta de contra-jogo e a constante atenção que o preto precisa ter sobre as possibilidades de o branco "montar" a posição.  deixando passar 16...cc5! o emprego da tática para resolver problemas estratégicos é uma habilidade difícil de dominar, mas necessária quando nos metemos em posições apertadas.  não era o lance que eu esperava ter de fazer nessa posição, mas no final acabou me parecendo o menos pior. mais uma vez estava numa posição normal, mas me sentindo muito, muito inferior.  algo precipitado... me deixa um pouco mais contente com a minha posição, embora não muito.  agora eu finalmente comecei a me sentir mais seguro, e de fato a posição melhorou um pouco pra mim - está praticamente igualada.  começando a perder a linha que eu havia acabado de encontrar. aqui mais uma vez era preciso fazer um lance difícil: 28...cd5 seguido de ed5!! analisando bem as posições resultantes, parece que esse é mesmo o melhor caminho pra segurar as pontas, mas sei da minha dificuldade para aceitar posições pouco ortodoxas - não podendo ver todas as variantes, certamente não jogaria isso.  perdendo a paciência, acreditando em algumas variantes taticamente favoráveis. erro comum de se cometer em posições difíceis, defender é bastante cansativo. agora, se o branco evita as armadilhas (bobas, diga-se de passagem), a posição é muito fácil de jogar.  erro decisivo. mater as torres daria mais chances de empatar ou mesmo oferecer resistência. o bispo é muito inferior ao cavalo.  o branco encontra o plano.   
-------------------------------------
parece estranho que os dois lados façam lances com o peão 'h' aparentemente sem motivo e ainda assim não haja nada de estranho. de mais a mais, 8.h3 é um lance útil em várias outras linhas. aqui serve para evitar que meu bispo de casas negras seja expulso de e3, já que após cf6-g4 ele não poderia contar com a casa g5.  11.f3 não me agradou por causa da fraqueza das casas negras ao redor do meu roque. algumas variantes me convenceram disso, mas o fritz não vê problema. alternative variation: 11. f3 nh5 12. qd2 ng3 13. rf2 qh4  aqui começou uma série de manobras estranhas, das quais tirei vantagem.  ameaça 15.bc5 e cria pressão em toda a ala dama pisando em a7 e c7.  com o cavalo exilado em a6 tudo deveria ficar mais fácil, mas aqui optei por entrar em complicações desnessárias. defender o peão em b4 e progredir lentamente com dc2-b3, bf3-e2, f2-f4, etc. seria o melhor caminho.  a idéia (equivocada) de tirar proveito da vantagem em desenvolvimento acabou facilitando as coisas pro negro.  desde 17...f5 até aqui fiz bons lances e tenho vantagem, objetivamente falando, mas achava que estava mal! esse erro de avaliação e o efeito psicológico subsequente levaram aos próximos lances, que acabaram com a superioridade que eu tinha.  outro erro significativo, que leva quase a igualdade. muito mais forte seria 28.de1! ganhando o peão em seguida com grande vantagem.  o cavalo negro em a6 está muito mal posicionado e, em mãos mais hábeis a posição seria facilmente convertida em vitória. no entanto continuo fazendo questão de escolher lances fracos que dão chances de igualdade.  me permitindo 33.tg1+ seguido de tf8+ ou txe4! mas...  segundo o fritz a posição é igual, mas agora começo a ir de mal a pior.  dois jogadores se esforçando pra mostrar como não se joga um final. 46...cg7, impedindo meu rei de chegar em h6 seria muito mais forte.  aqui, em um final nem tão difícil de converter, meu adversário deixou a seta cair, confuso entre uma variante e outra. uma armadilha comum em controles com acréscimo...  
-------------------------------------
estou empregando a petroff há pouco tempo e não estou muito familiriazado com as transposições. aqui já tive que começar a pensar.  um erro. a única justificativa para capturar com o cavalo seria com intenção real de tomar duas vezes em c3, o que ninguém com menos de 4 processadores e força de 3255 faria. correto é 8...cd5 seguido de 0-0 e c7-c6.  pegar o peão é muito perigoso, pra não dizer perdedor. depois de 11.ba3 duvido que o preto consiga resolver os problemas que surgem. alternative variation: 10... bxc3 11. ba3 be6 12. qf3 qd7 13. bb5 alternative variation: 10... bxc3 11. ba3 bxa1 12. qxa1 qg5 13. qc3 alternative variation: 10... bxc3 11. ba3 bf6 12. re1+ be6 13. be4  eu imaginei que a posição estaria próxima da igualdade depois de 10...be7, mas o tempo a mais do branco faz toda a diferença.  aqui eu achei que 12...tb8 não serviria por causa de 13.bf4 e dxc7, mas 13...bd6 seria razoável. mesmo após o lance da partida há esperança, mas de agora em diante o preto nunca tem chance de obter real compensação pelo peão e faz um jogo de resistência, até fraquejar no lance 22.  o branco corretamente não se deixa levar pela idéia de trocar algumas peças, que deixaria ao preto bom contrajogo pelo déficit material. alternative variation: 17. qxa8 rxa8 18. bxa8 qe5 19. rab1 f5  a última c hance de igualar estava justamente na troca de damas. 20.df4 já permite um arremate imediato. alternative variation: 20... qxd5 21. bxd5 bf5 22. rf3 bh2+ 23. kxh2 rxd5 24. bxa7 ra5  alternative variation: 21. rg3 bf8 22. rf3 qh6 23. qxf7+ kh8 24. bd5   
-------------------------------------
um plano antigo e raramente empregado, mas muito eficiente.  deixando margem para o preto transformar seu peão a mais em vantagem de verdade. alternative variation: 10. nxd5 bxd5 11. bxd5 qxd5 12. bxf4  aqui foi sugerido o seguinte plano, que parece mesmo bom: cc6-e7, g7-g5 e ce7-g6, com perspectivas de jogo ativo no flanco rei - fazendo uso do peão a mais para atacar! no entanto o fritz concorda com meu lance, que eu mesmo considero anti-posicional.  achei que minha vantagem residia na posse da coluna 'e' e tratei de ocupar a 7a logo, mas a coisa poderia ter sido feita de uma forma mais precisa alternative variation: 16... qa6 17. nd2 re5 18. qxf4 rae8  se é pra trocar em f6 de qualquer jeito, pra que debilitar um pouco mais??  capturar em b2 seria muito mais simples. daqui em diante o preto faz um lance ruim após o outro, ajudando o branco de todos os modos possíveis.  decisivo. devo isso a uma falha de cálculo pois ao jogar 26.cf4 não percebi que o cavalo ficaria pendurado após 27...cd6 28.cd6 td8 29. ce4 td1 30.tf4+-.  28.d7 seria a continuação lógica. aqui ordem dos fatores altera tudo.  31...tc2 defende muito mais fácil.  um erro inacreditáve l!! muito mais simples, com empate garantido, seria 36...td2. alternative variation: 36... rd2 37. re7+ kg6 38. rxc7 rxb2  melhor seria começar a marchar na ala da dama com 37...a5  mais uma vez 39.td2 seria melhor.  ainda assim, o final é de empate!! o mais incrível é que, após jogar toda a partida muito rapidamente, contava com mais de 1h contra menos de 10min do meu adversário. certas derrotas são mais que merecidas.  o lance perdedor. 44...c4 manteria o equilíbrio.  ameaçando promover seguido de mate. alternative variation: 51. h6 b1=q 52. h7+ kh8 53. rf8+ kg7 54. h8=q+ kxg6 55. rf6#

-------------------------------------
o correto era bd6. o lance jogado permite 9.cxe5 seguido por d4. no entanto as brancas preferem jogar mais cuidadosamente e perdem a iniciativa logo. desnecessário. não havia nenhuma ameaça presente na minha ala da dama... possivelmente pretendendo jogar cxe5, seguido de d4. 15.be4 parece melhor. abrindo a coluna d para a torre e a diagonal h2-b8 para o bispo. se agora 17.rg1 as pretas ganham com 17...bxf3 18.gxf3 ce5. horrível! as negras se apressam demais, deitando fora a oportunidade de dar o golpe final. 17...txd5! 18.exd5 ce5 ganhava imediatamente. um lance antes, e a partida ganha é perdida. agora acabou-se o ataque. inclusive, eu havia visto anteriormente a combinação de trocas, mas na hora esqueci de tudo e joguei o prematuro e fatal ce5, perdendo uma partida ganha. 24.td7+ era melhor. e aqui infelizmente não me lembro do resto da partida....

  so she takes and i take. and this is where she really backs out! she she gives back the piece without a fight leaving me a pawn up. the computer gives bxf6 19. nxd5+ kd6 20. nf3 bb7 21. nxb6+ ke6 22. nxa8 rxa8 23. h5 g5 24. rd3 g4 25. re3+ be4 26. nd4+ ke5 27. nb5 kd5 28. rd1+ kc4 as best for black with only a slight advantage to white. i commented at the time, "i am not sure that you have played the best defence, you could have gone in for variations where you had 2 minor pieces v my rook and 2, maybe 3 pawns. still material advantage to me, but less clear...." so i exchange  she recaptures not really aiming at the d5 pawn, but aiming to put the nf3 on d4, dominating the centre. so now i can take the pawn d5, but why? her bishop is tied up protecting it, my pieces are so active. so i continue to open lines so quits the h file i take up the dominating post she centralises the king i take she takes back i advance she gives d5 more protection but now i dominate the h file she challenges it i centralise my king she exchanges and again... so i take she takes back she commented "hmm, charles, you could have quite easily got a second pawn but you decided to press for a mating attack down the h column - unfortunately for you it has not come off but i think i am in for a tough endgame one pawn to the bad - joanne" and i said "i think you are too...." a6 is given as a mistake by the post-match computer, and gives … g5 30. nd3 a5 31. ke3 nf7 32. kd4 ke6 33. a4 bc6 34. na7 bb7 35. b3 ba6 36. nc6 kd6 37. nb8 bb7 38. e3 as black's best bet, but it is still lost! hitting the bishop and now the pawn b6 and now her bishop is terrible! all her pawns are on the same coloured squares as her bishop, blocking its movements. now black cannot avoid losing a second pawn. and now black cannot avoid losing a third pawn, so she throws in the towel. please leave a comment or two and don't forget to rate my annotation to let me know how i am doing!

transposition in sicilian is possible. but white does not take trading black is up in developpement logical moves, developping king in safe only proper place for the knight with white pawn on d5 the most logical move, although, playing the dsb was an option both kings are safe knight on the h file is generally considered as bad but it attacks the lsb which has few squares available. so that black gets a double pawn and weakens his king but i'm not sure it's a very good move, for it let the center free for black. now white's plan is to attack using the a2g8 diagonal protecting the d pawn and opening the way for the e rook closing the way and menacing the lsb developping and menacing the anoying e knight to protect the e knight and menace white's dsb protecting the dsb and enabling to double the rooks on the open file. the dsb is seriously menaced and dame guenièvre cannot protect both bishops, so that... i take the annoying knight. which  reappears... to go on a safer place and menace a further be6+ (white's plan is still to attack the king using the a2 g8 diagonal) attacking f2 defending. it doesn't weaken the king that much because black has no more lsb the black dsb goes back in his domain to enable 19. re2 and protect the rook preparing b5. i do not like the position : material is equal, white controls the open file but black's knight prevent movement, white's pawn structure is slighly better, the kings are safe. the center is contested but white has far less possibilities of action, particularly on the queenside. the main problem is the powerfull blak knight on e5. to counter black's queenside attack. with the queen so far away from her husband and feeling that the situation on the queenside will be difficult to handle and the black knight controlling many important squares, white decides energic action. to get rid of the anoying knight and get a strong attack, i thought it was ok to sacrifice my king safety. if necessary, arthur can hide on h3.  black chooses to exchange. beginning of a bloodbath. the board will be clearer within 3 moves. good place for the queen weakening the pawn structure the black queen is dangerous but isolated, it cannot give mate. first setting the queen on the center. a very good place to establish a camp. no pawn can annoy dame guenièvre, black has no more bishops and no more knight, so that the queen will be hard to dislodge. black could have plaid 23.rf7, maybe better now white is one pawn late, has a bad pawn structure, a weak king but controls the open file and the center. i estimate that the situation is equal. defending. to menace e8, b7 and g7 providing an escape for the king. white will have to attack along the 7 line. menacing g7. of course, black can harass the poor king arthur, unguarded in his weak castle because most of his armies are at war in foreign territories. black let g7 fall, prefering to take the central pawn. at this point the black king is in serious trouble. if 29. rh7+ kg8 30. qg7 mate. if the black queen stays on the a1 h 8 diagonal, it's a bit longer : 29. rh7+ kg8 30. rh6 menacing mate by 31. qh7 black plays 30. ... qg7 31. qe6+  and the black queen will be lost.  so that black has to give perpetual chess to draw.  he still has 2 way to win : fork attack between the white king and the g rook and mate, using his f rook if the white king comes on the e file.   both players have to be very carefull. mistake. 28. qh1+ would have been better for... ... black cannot give chess (except with rook sacrifice by 29. ... rxf4 30. gxf4 qxf4+) aiming at g7, thus preventing the mating menace 30. h7+ kg8 31. qg8 mate it seemed the most logical move with mat threat. the gk computer points it as a blunder. rxg6 was far better. only move black must give perpetual chess, which may be possible in such a situation let's go i didn't find anything else to do. if the king comes on g2 to gain h3, black can bring his queen on h5.  black cannot harasse arthur anylonger. the black queen goes back to her guarding postl and menaces the rook. allanchessw proposes a draw. draw offer sent and accepted. 34. kf1 is a blunder. the gk computers "sees" a forced mate in 6 for white. i couldn't find it; can you ? 
-------------------------------------
i normally go for 3.e5 straight, or else nd2, unless i want to try an already forgotten alekhine attack on the king´s side. but it is nice to try new things from time to time, especially on blitz games. not sure what are the lines here though. going for a classic e5 spearhead, but without supporting d4 with c3. i know that white can try now h4 at a certain timepoint. but also that an alternative to support e5 is this f4 before doing nf3. again, not sure if this is the strongest line for white here. trying to go to f5 and also qb6 to support attack on d4. 7.bd3 doesn´t look appealing now since 7...c4 seems a little bit annoying for white, so i tried to get rid of bb in b4 and at the same time getting creating a support in c3 for d4. now, is it ba5 stronger than this? now again, 9...c4 might not be that bad and after 10.bxf5 black has chances and a more active bishop. not sure if looking for the castling (black) would do me a favour though. king at the center might be good enough for black. then i would have moved things onto the "b" column. doesn´t seem white has now enough firepower to go for the king, and that doubled pawn situation in "f" is not that bad after be6. playing solid. again, seems good to me to hold the castling and activate some figures for black. now, what can i do? i considered that future nc4 to be annoying enough to have it exchanged for my wb. will black accept the trade? threatening ba3, blocking castling. seems a pain, that´s why i bargained with the idea of changing those two pieces and at the same time activating my "a" rook. seems a good deal for white. how about castling and then doing nc4...?  it seems a must for black. and now we have a rook in the third line that can go to "b", "g" or "h" column. would castling be a safe move? let´s see. now the idea is to set n at g5, q at h5 and r in h3. a fair counterattack. black can try now, if white is passive enough, to advance f6 and then bishop supports the defence and at the same time, 6th line is open for the bq to heal as well. and white seems to play passive as i said. but i want´t sure what else to do, since moving the wq would lead to d4 capture and check. now this, although a general rule is also to attack the opposite flank you are hammering, doesn´t seem to help black to defend himself. 18.qh5 would have led to the same position (or very similar) and here comes the beauty of this position... maybe passive again, but i didn´t see anything clear with 19.qh5 yet. and though black wouldn´t dare to take n in g5. but i was wrong. now, is this a grave mistake? it seems to me so, but i may be wrong. now black doesn´t have many choices to avoid mate. but white doesn´t have many either. a false move and it´d spoil the whole attack. it seemed to me the only one to keep pressure up. would 21.fxg have been a better choice? i was aiming for rh5 then h4 and open the "h" column for my rooks to double there and finish the job. but i didn´t see this one and now it seems i cannot count on my rf1 to help me out. now, black cannot come to f7 since it would mean mate in h7. how can i exploit that? maybe with h3 or h4 (opening also an escape route for wk) and in case of gxh, f5. but now i have blocked the mate in h7..careful now. not sure i can find a fast enough attack. defending g7, a clear move. maybe rc7 would have been a better choice, allowing then r8f7 and letting the bk escape through f8-e7. but now, is mate in one in h8. it seems no way out could have been found for black after hxg5 (or maybe even before that). a beautiful ending for a classic attack on a french defence. 1-0 
-------------------------------------
the game start with a french tarrasch so i'll start to make comments after the opening. open variation. at this stage the computer give +0,04 for white but obviously the game just started and maybe this small advantage is the initiative... i don't really know..^__^ place the rook in e file and let the space for the knight or bishop to go to a safe place. my opponent is a 2000 so i tried to play attacking but looking the back rows as well. and actually this f1 square would be very useful later on the game.... (pc doesn't like: -0,10?!?) attacking the centre with strong piece. i'll lose a pawn like this... prefer to create space for my dsb and replace my knight just beside his renzo. at this stage the game is at -0,39 but i see some good possibility on the king side. so i go ahead with my plan.. of course black spot the danger and start to counter play  f file opened but check on the way to oblige black renzo on the corner at this stage the game is -0,58!! and i have a pawn that will be loss and possibly a double pawn on f file!! but lost for lost i continue my original plan  attacking with all pieces available this king side!of course black has a way to defend all of this. here my first mistake spotted by the computer (-1,76) but i didn't want to double my pawn on f so i tried to keep my king  protected with a queen replacement and tempo lost.. computer saying the best is to take dxe4 !! but already decided to leave this move to black so.. here i continuing covering my bishop and attacking the witched rook. there is a mate on the air if black made a wrong move! but still the pc give -2,58!! and i guess it' right! feeling very uncomfortable but still hoping ^__^  of course the best! and finally the rook is taken and saving the renzo guards in their squares! and finally d4 went down attacking my lady. notice that taking with the knight i can take e5 with my rook moved at move 9. i'm not sure about this move.  keeping the pressure on the king. forcing my opponent to take the bishop! unpinning the knight and prevent the big canon queen rook.  queen in the centre to prevent a check and /or rook attacking. still available combination on h file. black doesn't have a lot of options to attack my guardians so i need to continue with the plan on pressuring him. and here the black blunder which i guess give me the opportunity to win the game! from -3,19 the game pass to +3,25. best move was:nf6 20.  rh4  e5  21. be3 qxb2  22. bxd4 exd4  23. rd1 qxa2  24. qxd4 a5  25. ng3 a4  26. re1 and keeping the piece up! i couldn't believe when i saw this and i was uncertain if take it or not!! what is black plan? but finally i took i breathe looked how i was leaving my troops behind: my rook will be in danger and a check can be received and dsb gone. however a queen and rook close to the king can be very nasty!  so let's go!! i thought about bh6 but leading no where and blocking my lady who needs space to express herself ;p .. menacing a check and consequently trouble. black doesn't have many option to defend: bf7 or ne5 second option bringing back some help for the king attacking the rook and defending the pawn! however with move block black lsb.  here i thought: if black move on the black square i can activate my dsb and put more pressure and with 3 pieces chasing the renzo maybe i can make it... but black is an expert player and found a beautiful way to get out of this difficult situation. so i start my chase for some material or a a winning move.. here computer give +1,94 second rook grabbed but the queen now is on the opposite corner of his companion!!! can she manage to help him in case of danger? chapeau to jack!! what a defend!! menacing the queen and attacking my rook!i didn't see this arriving! back on the king side where a small target is still available to open the way to my kings pawns.  mistake the computer says!! best it says would have been : 29. bd2  kb5  30. a4+ ka6  31. qxg7 qc6  32. ne3 be6  33. qh7 e4  34. bc3 qd7  35. qh5 kb6  36. bd4+ bc5  37. a5+ kc6.  but i have long term plan and my king is protected enough and bd2 can still be done. pawn lost as preview.. covering the check but still pinned and safe the menace to my last cowboy still on f1 after 21 moves!! so here i go! 5 moves to the joy! i will have the time? for computer is a mistake!!! 32. ng3  b5  33. nf5 d4  34. bg5 qa3  35. nxd6 qxd6  36. a4 a6  37. be7 qe6  38. axb5+ axb5 so black take the pawn and computer says mistake! the game appears balanced: white on king side and black on the queen one! but my pawn already start his run!! run forrest run!! black attack my lady and bring some forces to prevent the promotion. but his pieces are on the the other side and the long black diagonal is still free. keeping the pressure on the knight and consider as well the exchange bishop rook. -2! here many possibility and black almost safe the position. i saw a sacrifice the lady to approach forrest but then his promotion will be on white square which can be covered by bishop and queen, so not a good plan.and now the piece pinned is the knight and not the bishop considered the pin i take the long diagonal!and protect case promotion! for pc is a mistake!!!seriously i don't understand some time the way the computer is thinking!!for him the best is:h7 be5  37. qf5 bh8  38. nd2 ke7  39. nxc4 dxc4  40. bc5+ nxc5  41. qxc5+ kf7  42. qd5+ ke7  43. qxb7+ kf6  44. qc6+ kg7  45. qc7+ kg6  46. rxc4??  anyway chess the beauty of chess is that the possibility are millions!! black tempting by taking the piece and take the initiative!! i prefer a promotion indeed! -1!! and here black attack!! would i resist? points for pc is  +3,79 attacking and protecting dsb. he needs to survive standing in that position the priest. forced queen exchange! black won a piece and if i take the knight all my plan would have been useless. i see the trap and give the ok to forrest! he did it! good one forrest, deserved promotion for your effort ^__^. now renzo with his new lady is another man ;p.  black has 3 pieces while white only 2. black has a free highway on queen side to promote as well. tricky situation but i need to keep the initiative!! double attack on with a check or pawn take. my plan now is to reduce black movement and possibly leave just one pawn on file b. here i feel quite comfortable though i don't' have to commit any mistake and precipitate my attack.  so looking the board i said i need to stop theses pawns advance and consequently his king and if another forrest make another marathon it will done. intermediate check for queen relocation.. voilà the queen in the centre.now black doesn't have many options.. and renzo said is time to enter in action as well after 39 moves sitting on his armchair.  i considered bf1 and thoguth it would be good to have renzo on the front of the pawn. but black has finished his munitions ;° and after this one black resign!  a good battle which brought my first victory against an expert player. i got lucky as he blundered at move 20 but still is a great satisfaction. i hope to be able to write another annotation like this without waiting 3 years!!  thanks for reading and maybe you enjoyed as well .(bella) ciao

popular first move. a normal reply. threatens the pawn. protects with the knight. opens up bishop early. threatens the e-pawn. now, for the gambit. someone threatens nf7, winning queen or rook. the only way to stop it. takes the pawn. takes back. someone takes the pawn. one would think: what? but someone is smart. takes the knight. checks the king with the queen, now the knight is vulnerable. protects the knight. a risky move. someone else is not in a good position. threatens the knight, as it is pinned to the king by the bishop. ?? gets out of the pin, but this is a really bad move. checkmate in 3. i am plus one and am about to get checkmate. king moves to the only possible square. i check the king again, being protected by my bishop. now, mate in one. moves to the only possible square and… checkmate! the knight checkmates the king, also blocking his escape square: c5. the queen does the rest. that is a perfect example of why not to protect the knight with your king when the fried liver gambit is being played against you.

qgd slav defence (d10) qgd slav (d11), 3.nf3 här lämnar svart qgd slav (d11), 3.nf3. 4...e6 hade varit i linjen, och faktiskt varit statistiskt bättre för svart. normal utveckling så här långt. nu är det dags för mittspel. här är det frestande att gå upp med s till e5 i mitten. problemet är att den utväxlingen slutar med att svart centraliserar sin dam på e5. då får jag mindre spelrum, så jag försöker öppna upp tornet på b istället. här ligger svart starkare till i mitten, så jag får satsa på mina sidobönder istället. min a-bonde ligger efter, så den verkar lämplig. dags att öppna upp i svarts bondeled. frestelsedraget ne5 kvarstår, men så gör även positionsförlusten i o m att svarts d mobiliserar i mitten. vi kör flankattack istället. här gäller det att utnyttja svarts dåliga positioner spec m a p k, bl a är hela b-filen öppen för avancemang. hans d hotar förvisso h2, men den är inte uppbackad. det finns stora möjligheter att tränga in svarts k i ett mattnät. nu tar vi befäl över b-filen med d och sätter press på hans k. tar ikapp lite material, även om jag positionellt ligger bättre till. svart är relativt låst i sin position och hans bägge l är dåliga. skyddar även mitt t med detta drag. tränger in svarts k och skapar färre valmöjligheter för hans drag. ett intressant läge med garanterad materialförlust för svart. trampar han fel så blir det matt snart. röntgar flyktvägen mot e6 och binder ihop mattnätet. nu går jag upp med t och schackar så får jag hans d innan vi säger godnatt. möjligen finns det snabbare mattar, men frestelsen att slå hans d är för stor. nu kan han endast parera med d. min l står fint och hindrar hans s från att slå mitt t. nu är matten nära. först slår jag dxd5, sedan går han antingen med k till f6 eller e5 och och då slår jag dxf5#. matt om ett drag. där satt den ! 
-------------------------------------
queen's pawn (d00), stonewall attack. här lämnar vit queen's pawn (d00), stonewall attack, där 5.nc3 hade varit i den linjen. då börjar vi sabba hans "stenmur" av bönder, även om han tillfälligt kan reparera den med exd4. i såfall fortsätter jag bara med dxc4 och knäcker upp en bräcka i mitten av muren. går han då upp och slår bxc4 , så går jag upp med nxd4 och då är min s säkrad av min d. sådärja, nu är stenmuren spräckt och mitt läge i centrum ser bra ut. materiellt står vi förvisso lika, men jag är betydligt mer utvecklad. vits pjäser ligger långt bak och skräpar, medan jag har en rockad inom räckhåll. här bryter han mot regeln att s bör utvecklas före l, så jag ligger bättre till positionellt. här får jag en snygg gaffel mellan d och l, även om den inte är särskilt stark. ett medelmåttigt drag, men preventivt för eventuella attacker mot g5. dessutom frikopplar draget min l på e7, så att den kan ägna sig åt mer offensiva uppdrag. blockerar vits s på b5 och d5, samt frikopplar min d från bevakningen av de rutorna. dags att flytta fram positionerna, och spontant ser jag att mina bönder ligger långt bak. får se upp med att inte låsa in damen bara. sätter lite press på hans d, och luckrar upp hans försvar. det börjar bli dags att närma sig hans k. det finns inga säkra kapt. så jag får tänka lite långsiktigt taktiskt. eftersom han saknar löpare, så kan det vara säkert att aktivera kungstornet. sedan avtäcker jag e-filen med l och har den säkrad med t. här trodde jag att han skulle ta min d med t, men desto bättre att han osäkrar bägge sina s.  nu börjar min d bli mäktig, och det är dags att se om det finns kombinationer som ger vit större materialförluster. här borde han ha tagit min l, men trevligt med ett t gratis, och jag tvingar även upp vits k längs h-filen. nu har jag både det materiella och positionella övertaget. med så många bönder kvar, så borde någon av dom kunna promoveras om vit är segmattad. här resignade vit alldeles för tidigt enligt min mening. eftersom misstag alltid sker, så hade jag väntat med att ge upp. 
-------------------------------------
this game starts a najdorf sicilian. as usual i play the najdorf. so far i haven't refrained from the najdorf and only adopted other openings in speed play. bg5 - this promises a tough fight. he chooses the sharpest line. 7. bc4 combined with bg5 is unknown to me, though i have encountered it in speed games, but never looked it up in libraries or saw it in pros games. i decide to play the usual suspects. this leaves the d4 knight unprotected and prevents f4. i feel relieved. business stuff severely reduces my thinking time these days. i know this is strange with a6 and no bishop or queen aside to take back on c6. so i have a battery of pawns on the 6th range "doing the same job". still i opt for this to strengthen my center. of course my opponent goes for this scenario. an additional benefit is the newly opened b-file. of course ...a6 was wasting time now. still my rival is keen for double edged play. now his rook is opposite my queen, attacking the d-pawn. but i feel one single center pawn is not enough. some calculation assures the d-pawn is poisoned. so i can forcefully develope my queen. it seems my opponent goes for the d-pawn. i leave the pawn en pris because taking it just helps me. there is a direct line winning the exchange plus keeping the pressure towards the queenside. forking rook and bishop. naturally defending both. taking away the squares of the rook. wrongly trying to keep the exchange. i guess, 14. rhd1 was way better. there goes the rook! instead of giving the rook white correctly gives the bishop and causes some stir.  no point in sidestepping. the maneuver to save the rook and frighten me with a brief queen - king vis-à-vis. usually i never keep a piece (especially the king) opposite an attacker, but here opting for blocking with the bishop seems better. saving the rook and preparing to double along the d-file. preparing castling by hand and leaving the rook face to face with white's queen. stepping away from the rook. alright. time to go from defence to attack. the little struggle around the poisoned d-pawn actually decided the game. i am up one piece for two pawns and in an excellent attacking position. the d-file is "lost" for sure. but my play will be along the b-file anyway. ...and along the a2/e6-diagonal. attacking my kingside is way too slow. i'd go for tense defending moves only. "castling" brought to an end. this is useless. all white's power is along the d-file(, where is nothing to attack). this does not only stop white's h-pawn from advancing, it also sets up a lethal attack with my dark-squared bishop along the c1/g5-diagonal. white makes use of the d-file by finally attacking something. (the e6-bishop.) but this allows a beautiful finish. did he say "finish"? yes, finish. can you spot it? i either win further material with keeping tense pressure or checkmate. i am luckily allowed the latter. my first move of a sequence to drive the king to the vulnerable b-file and control c1. i guess, 23. r6d2 was better. can you spot the lethal attack? here it comes - a classic tin opener. standard shot. everything is forced now. "okay, show me what you got!" the next cannon comes into play. the only choice possible. threatening checkmate on b2. this must be prevented. but only 26. rd8+ parting with further material would have accomplished this. 26. rb1 leads to checkmate. check. both answers to this don't defend. my three pieces left threaten checkmate on two squares. thank you!  with my e6-bishop en pris and the other two pieces giving checkmate this makes a nice picture. 
-------------------------------------
ik ging de confrontatie aan, 2 torens voor en dame als zwart hier slaat volgt volgt pxg5+ daarom speelde hij lf4 de beste verdediging  hier had ik al eerder gxh7 moeten spelen, dat klopt. maar zwart vergat gxh6 te spelen. hij dacht met df4 het probleem op te lossen.       hier win ik alsnog een pion. df4? dat moet, want dxd2??. dan zou ik g8(d+) mat spelen. lh5? fxe4! zwart heeft deze combinatie bedacht. als ik nu 28 tae1 speel, ga ik mat. er volgt dan:  [28. tae1 - dg5+, 29. kf2 - dg2+ mat, het veld e1 is niet bereikbaar voor de koning. een mooie matcombinatie van zwart, echter ik heb ook nagedacht!!!] ld3! {nu heb ik dit veld e1 als vluchtveld.} vandaar dat ik zo lang over ld3 heb moeten nadenken, het moest wel goed zijn hè… dxh3?  en ik ben ontsnapt en heb nu 2t +p tegen d.  het was idd. zeer ingewikkeld, vooral als je achter het bord dit alles maar moet uitvinden.  zwart geeft op. 
-------------------------------------
hier dacht ik nog even aan spektakel varianten met 6…..pxe4. 7. pxe4 d5. dat wordt dan weerlegd door 8. lb5 +. daarom moet a6 eerst en gerard haalt met zijn volgende zet de mogelijkheid pxe4 er definitief uit. dus ga ik op de normale siciliaanse manier door met ontwikkelen de beslissing wat te doen met de stukken op de damevleugel nog even uitstellen ik had gedacht dat hij lang zou rocheren. op chess base kon ik 19 partijen met de korte rochade vinden, waarvan wit er flink wat won!  nu is het voor zwart heel lastig om een goede voortzetting te vinden, daarom heb ik hier wel een minuut of 10-15 bedenktijd gebruikt. belangrijk is meestal het goed op tijd plaatsen van de opstoot d6-d5. ik besluit daarom de loper op b3 af te ruilen. wat voor alternatieven heeft zwart? tfd8? pe5? h6? de laatste vond ik griezelig want misschien kan wit wel gewoon offeren op h6. achteraf lijkt 14.   pxb3 15. cxb3 kh8 me beter voor zwart, het wint een tempo ten opzichte van pc4. nu neemt wit het initiatief vooral geen lxf6, vanwege dxd6 deze zet was erg naar mijn zin.  dd4 lijkt mij een goed alternatief voor wit. een heel dwingende zet, ik moet dan weer lang gaan nadenken of ik de dame wil afruilen en zo ja hoe.  bxc6 in verband met de opstoot d6-d5, die gaat mogelijk worden en geeft mij de nodige ruimte daar is-ie dan eindelijk. df2 lijkt mij ipv kh1 een solide alternatief voor wit, maar wel erg richting remise, bijvoorbeeld 22. df2 d5 23 exd5 cxd5 24. dxc5 lxc5. heel ander spel gerard gaf hier zelf i.p.v f5 g3 als degelijker alternatief aan. dat is voor wit minder riskant, maar zet wel th3 geïsoleerd hier kwam het nodige rekenwerk aan te pas. gerards’ voortzetting heb ik gezien, maar ook 
-------------------------------------
  het paard kan worden geïncasseerd, maar het initiatief is even weg op 33…..cxd5 volgt 34. txd5, dan niet exd5 doen, maar kc6 . in tijdnood zag ik deze mogelijkheid niet en dacht ik dat tg8 er af ging na 34. exd5 35. dd5+ kc7 36. dxg8 df3 is de enige oplossing voor wit, td7 kan absoluut niet reken maar eens na, slaan op d2 is volgens mij niet goed dd3 lijkt lastiger, maar dan volgt dd5 met ruil wit moet wel, want torenruil op g5 is een verloren eindspel de rest heb ik niet meer opgeschreven, want ik had toen al minder dan 5 minuten.
-------------------------------------
 even worse is the fact this match was for records, if i won i got £30 worth of records if i lost then i had to give him £10 of records, as well as the others in the rr!! looking for the fried liver attack i remember from been 11years old blocked castled nice & early. attacking e4 cant remember what was going on here. maybe creating some room for a queenside queen attack? or stopping bishop getting trapped and allowing him a little escape route? blocking ng4 queen trying to work way free looking at h7. infact i'm going to go all out for it.  going to blow open the centre, rid knight and nail him on h7 with my queen  centre is mounting up with pressure here we go at all cost i must clear e4 and now i've got rid of knight. i'm a pawn down but am going to take that tempo and slam the game shut.

gambito escocès. super !! aceptado discreta y defensiva jugada cf6 con valentìa ! maniobra de la dama a su lugar punto debil punto debil punto debil debilidades del negro. tengo el control absoluto del ataque. con esta jugada se gana un peon y/ o la calidad en jugadas posteriores explotando debilidades.haciendo maniobras y dejando espacio para mi alfil jugada inevitable tiene que hacer algo para dejar la octava linea libre para su torre pero no pienso que era loi mejor se pierde peon pasado. si dxf6, dxd5+ y dxa8. si ce7, se simplifica con el alfil amenazando con te1 si df6 txe7 !! dxa1 y te8!! el peon central se queda desprotegido para evitar dxd5+ y dxa8 
-------------------------------------
gambito escosès con respuesta sorpresa de negro esa jugada es para estudiar parecìa que se comìa uno de los dos alfilesero no ! pienso que el blanco tiene un tiempo de mas porque se ha enrocado y puede empezar a fabricar su ataque mientras que el negro si se enroca va a tener que recuperar el tiempo perdido preparo traslado de la dama a d4 ???, pienso que cxd5,ed,te8 !! 8puede sacar al negro del apuro pieza de mas en la jugada 13.. amenaza de mate cxb4 
-------------------------------------
ahí vamos!! gambito de dama negra en el tablero. tanto si las blancas toman de caballo como si toman de peón el repertorio se va a centrar en esta jugada. tremenda pérdida de tiempo..., y un tiempo es oro en esta posición. otra pérdida de tiempo. las blancas se dedican a ir gastando tiempos y con ello su ventaja de salida.  jugada dudosa. las negras están ya bastante mejor. han finalizado el desarrollo y aunque su estructura es ligeramente inferior las blancas, de momento no pueden sacar ventaja de ello. objetivamente ...cg4 era más fuerte pero que sería una partida de café sin sacrificios. en estas posiciones puede sentirse la fuerza del alfil de c8. sin haber realizado una jugada es el máximo responsable del descabello.
-------------------------------------
  el caballo vuelve a g4 creando nuevas amenazas. la torre no era suficiente valiosa para tan aventajado corcel. única! de nuevo las negras rechazan la captura de la torre e introducen una nueva pieza en el ataque. manteniendo la presión. recordadme que el af8 tb puede salir por a6!.  amenazando ganar la dama con cxt seguido del jaque de torre.  
-------------------------------------
otra vez! el gambito de dama negra, también conocido en lengua inglesa como elephant gambit. entramos en nuestra línea favorita con 3...ad6. las blancas desarrollan rápido sus piezas sin molestar el desarrollo negro. si las blancas quieren crear problemas tienen que jugar d4. en caso contrario las negras están bien. evitando un posible cb5 y preparando la expansión b5 en el flanco dama con idea de fianchetar el alfil de casillas claras y presionar sobre d5. quizás más correcto era cb6 tras lo cual o bien el ce4 volvía a c3 o bien se cambiaba en f6 ganando tiempos. las piezas negras miran hacia el flanco de rey..., es allí donde hay que buscar espacio. especulativa. jugada de café!! tras los los fuegos artificiales las blancas están mejor pero... bang! se les va la posición de las manos. bang! it's over.

commetry by, crazyeye180 (black) and davidtornheim (white)  the second in a series of (so far) two very very close games: the first was a queens gambit 1-0 (crazyeye180 white), and the third is currently in progress - a sicillian, davidtornheim with the white pieces. black :this has always been my response to nf3, it seems to be solid and catches people who expect knight moves unaware. it also allows black to steer white away from e4 opening traps – which i hate. it also fits in fairly well with my queens pawn opening play as white as some of the ideas seem to be the same.  white: i agree and play the same.  when reti first played 1.nf3, his master opponents played either d5 or nf6, still the most common replies today and approved by rybka and fritz.  i too play d5 when black, as 2. c4 d4 followed by 3. ... c5 quickly establishes a troublesome cramping outpost in the midst of white's undeveloped space, which will only get worse if ignored. white:  reti.  if i wanted a queen's gambit, i would have played 1. d4. white:  yes, better than the other common moves dxc4, c6 and e6  i think.  rybka and fritz also prefers it. white:   reti's reply.  rybka and fritz agree this is best. white:   either this or c5 are both strong. white:	   reti's choice. black:   6. …   nf6 is apparently better, as played by junge – alekhine 1942 (0 – 1) – i think the plan is for black to challenge for the centre with this knight aiding the e pawn  etc. in an opposite vien 6. … c6?! (fridman – short 1999 (1/2 -1/2)) aims to give white’s centre mobility problems and take some of the sting of white’s white bishop.  white:	rybka agrees, but most people play e5. white:  time to start chasing the queen around, while developing my pieces. black: perhaps 9. nb5 would be stronger? – it still hassles the queen and assuming black plays bb4+ 10. bd2 bxd2+ 11. qxd2 qe7 the knight is now in a more useful position, and protects d4 for the pawn advance.  white:  rybka agrees that nb5 is better by 0.3 of a pawn. black: using the won tempo to cover the weak black squares on the kingside – i almost expected something like qg5 to come next here however that wouldn’t be much of a game. i think this position is even.  white:  rybka agrees it's about even with 0.16 advantage to white, although thought 11. qd4 was a slightly better move for black. black: 12.  0-0-0 perhaps is stronger? making the most of white’s developed pieces – giving his centre a bit of a boost? black hasn’t got a black bishop any more so there’s no threat of the pin on the queen, and white has time before black can activate his other pieces, and due to the black queen’s position …f5? to challenge the knight isn’t strong as it practically damns the knight and limits black’s castleing options. though this line is interesting and might be worth looking into.  white: rybka gives:  be2 (0.10), rd1 (0.03), o-o-o (0.02).  black:  i don’t understand this. white’s knight is in a much better position than black’s and it’s moved more – therefore it’s worth more. whilst this move does kind of force white to win another tempo on the queen white kills his own attack. perhaps castling would be better. – let black deal with it and keep the initiative.  white: white and rybka disagree with the above,and find castling on either side slightly inferior.  rybka rates nxf6+ at 0.13-0.18 and castling at 0.08 and o-o-o at -0.10 , a slight but significant difference.   white expected (and rybka strongly advises)  13. … nxe4 14. dxe4, because black would not tolerate the presence of this centralized knight.  regardless of how that knight got to such a strong presence, white assumes his opponent will make the strongest move and it will be gone in one move.  given its doom, white must decide:   is it better to be taken or to do the taking?  if white waits to be taken by black, he is left with two unprotected pawns and the queen  wide open for attack by a rook on the d-file, that rook protected by the queen safely at e7.    on the other hand, if white takes black’s knight first, black does not gain any tempo, because his queen will have to expend a move recapturing.  this recapture move by black does not improve the his queen’s position.   in fact, with o-o, the black queen is in danger of the castled rook, which white hoped would be unveiled unexpectedly at a time inconvenient for black.  f4 nicely accomplishes this on the next move, a move that an overconfident white unfortunately overlooked.   so black’s queen was safer at e7, and the recapture move was of no benefit and if anything lost time.   so, white chose to do the taking to prevent the undesired scattering of his pawns by the recapture preferring black’s recapture putting his queen in a possible line of fire at f6.   white did not seriously consider o-o-o because the king is a bit too vulnerable with the stray c-pawn, which can be easily attacked by be6, a move rybka recommends.   however, white concedes that o-o-o does appear to have a strong attack up the center, but with the queen in the lead, and black’s queen side rook about to come out, it looks more like the attacking queen would get ambushed rather than the reverse.  black: ok, perhaps this is a matter of taste. personally i would rather have the pawns on e and c unprotected and the fully open file with my rook and queen down the centre. as discussed above white's best move was f4.  white admits to being asleep at the wheel with b4.  rybka ranked it as the 20th best move.  given that programmers estimate roughly 20 possible moves for a typical middle game position, this is not a very high ranking.  with 75% of the minor pieces off the board and white's king was safely defended and could start looking towards the end game.  white's plan was to win with better pawn positions by quicker movement on the queen-side:  the idea was to move his a and b pawns two squares forward depriving his opponent the same move and slowing him down. white could also increase the length of the pawn chain.     the drawback was that with the rapid advance of the b-pawn, it could not longer defend the c-pawn, which was later captured undefended.  white failed to take into account the activity soon to come from the undeveloped rooks.     before this move, rybka rated white at a 0.10 advantage.  after at -0.23. as discussed above white's best move was f4.  white admits to being asleep at the wheel with b5.  rybka ranked it as the 20th best move.  given that programmers estimate roughly 20 possible moves for a typical middle game position, this is not a very high ranking.  with 75% of the minor pieces off the board and white's king was safely defended and could start looking towards the end game.  white's plan was to win with better pawn positions by quicker movement on the queen-side:  the idea was to move his a and b pawns two squares forward depriving his opponent the same move and slowing him down. white could also increase the length of the pawn chain.     the drawback was that with the rapid advance of the b-pawn, it could not longer defend the c-pawn, which was later captured undefended.  white failed to take into account the activity soon to come from the undeveloped rooks.     before this move, rybka rated white at a 0.10 advantage.  after at -0.23. white:  now that black has attacked the base pawn to his chain, his kneejerk reaction is to add a defender.  he notes that black can pile on more attackers as is carefully analyzing the danger.  white has two goals for this pawn:  either keep it as the base of the pawn chain or advance it to the other side of the board, defended by multiple heavy pieces.  in past games using reti, white has won games with center pawns making it to the other side aided by rooks, so why not plan ahead? white:  black indeed throws another attacker at the base pawn. a little furniture rearrangement so as to continue to have 3 defenders on the base pawn.  with the old arrangement, the queen was the second defender, but we want our smaller defenders first.  with the new arrangement, the rook can take second and the queen third.  this also will make room for double rooks in a couple of more turns.  maybe black won't notice his a pawn is under attack.     white was particularly concerned with a possible e4 pawn advance, adding a 3rd attacker, and then qg6, a forth attacker.  however, rybka doesn't see an issue with e4 advance,  as d4 advance works just fine, even with the queen where it is, but it approves of the qe3 move, nonetheless. white:   black protects the a-pawn.  rybka prefers rd4 at this point; however, black eventually discovers and plays it at move 20. white:  with black's advance, white takes pleasure at long range diagonal shots fired at the queen side.  the bishop makes a tidy move rearrangement similar to that of the queen, capturing the beautiful long diagonal parallel to that of the queen creating a swath of squares his opponent can't use.  white's main reason originally for considering the move was to support a b5 pawn advance on the next move white:  prevents b5 and clips 4-squares off of white's long diagonal, but only if it remains defended by the queen, or perhaps later the center rook. white:  rybka prefers rfe1 or pawn moves. black: close to even here i think with the main difference that black has command of the half open d file – i thought as this was my main advantage it was to be defended at all costs: hence move 20...  white:   rybka agrees, rating it at -0.21. white:  rybka still prefers re1 even now or the pawn moves a3 or h3.   white is about to find out what! black: ! my favourite move for black of this game, though i feel i didn’t make the most of it.   white:  ouch!  white was completely blindsided by this, even joked with black to please move the rook back!  this outstanding move could have been made back as far as move 17.     white’s pawn advance has been blocked, which makes the two connected rooks useless.    what’s worse, the centralized rook cannot be evicted by any pawn or minor piece, and trading it with another rook would take far too many moves.  the only way to get it to move is to tempt with some morsel, (like say, a stray pawn, or require its use in a recapture, or find a way to get the e-pawn on the d-file by a capture.  (white eventually put its beautifully developed bishop on the chopping block as the bait.)  rybka scores the position at -0.43. white:  after many days mediation, this move appears the best way to deal with the unfortunate turn of events.  rybka agrees this is best.  before making this move, i spent most of my time worrying about vulnerability of pawns on the queen side and the danger of e4 attacking my beautiful bishop and threatening an attack on my queen.  then i notice the rook could move to the king side and support a large attack there.     with h3, the plan is subtle but effective for three reasons:  (1) it eliminate one square (g4) from black’s already cramped bishop [and eliminates this useful square for black’s queen and rook as well].   (2)  white prefers to keep all his big pieces where they are, but doing nothing is not usually a winning strategy in chess.  this does something:  it advances a pawn.  if black does nothing monumental next move, g4 chases off the bishop furthering the pawn advance.  (3) it gives the king a crucial escape square which is fully utilized later in the game.  white normally resists moving the three pawns in front of the king, but in this case, black has no dark-square bishop, and no easy way for black to exploit the hole created, and the advantages all outweigh the costs.  it also has the advantage of possibly lulling in the opponent to thinking white is being careless. black: ? i was blinded by the promise of converting my little advantage into a free pawn and missed the much better qd6! threatening the b pawn, further securing the central file and mounting more pressure on that e pawn. after 22. a3 rd8 and white cannot protect that backwards e pawn without trapping his own white bishop on d2, allowing either black to use the extra tempo to protect the king with something like h6 or something more aggressive like e4! winning the centre.  white: rybka ranks them in this order: -0.40 red8; -0.40 qg6; -0.39 qd6  white sees the advantage of red8 as it centralizes power on the middle file contesting the other side from white and helps to address the back rank problem that becomes an issue later for black (and thought black should have done this instead of rfe8 before). white was anticipating these moves, none of which rybka finds as favorable: attacks/advances: rh4(0.21), qh4(0.95), e4(1.53); defense of back rank: g6 (escape square)(0.16), kf8 (defends rook in event of attack and centralizes king for end game)(-0.18) white was pleased with this response: cuts off rook from the attack, entices rook off of central square, and for white's d-pawn to capture move of the d-file and enable mobilization of doubled rooks to attack the back rank. black can't ignore the aggressive bishop, another piece again threatening the queen. ryka also finds this the optimum move.  rybka agrees this is the best move. still at -0.40 white: the moment white was looking for. the pawn has moved on and the doubled rooks are mobilized for action rather than stuck at a road block.    black: c5 might have been stronger.  white: rybka agrees that c5 is much stronger (-0.49) vs. rxc4 (0.13). rybka's other choices: qxe4 (-0.04) and rxe4 (0.04). c5 would have solidified the lockhold the rook has on the center and avoid the temptation to leave to take a “free” pawn.  black: funilly enough enough i considered qxe4 for a while, but worried about an invasion onto my back rankwith my queen stuck infront of my e pawn. white is more than happy to lose a pawn to have the troublesome rook out of the way and to gain access to the bank rank and pin the rook against the king. rybka gives white back a half pawn of advantage here. white wonders if black is aware the back rook is pinned (and fears saying anything that might reveal this and have black correct the problem by creating an escape square for king or protecting the rook). white: black has unpinned the rook, but white was still uncertain if this is part of some other plan and by coincidence. white expected f6, f5, h6, h5 or kf8. rybka finds f6 best at (0.12), then kf8 (0.36) and qe6 at (0.37).    if black had tried the best move f6, white would have responded with qb3 (pinning the other rook too!) or qd3 (tripling the heavy pieces on the d-file).  although all very exciting and the appearance of a strong attack, rybka finds these responses to f6 basically a tie. however, with the actual move qe6, rybka says white has nearly half a pawn edge.  white: the queen that unpins the rook must go somewhere else!  (however, rybka prefers 25. qb3 (0.36) b5 26. r1d6 vs. 25. r1d6, perhaps because b5 weakens the pawn queen-side pawn structure. ) white: rybka agrees this this the only move.   black: my only option really, my main worry now becomes the g5 square. a queen secured on that could cause some major hassle for me. i played this line in the ( foolish) hope that white might be tempted to give me a position where i could swap the two rooks for the queen (for example, any move here that doesn't put the queen on the d file or move the d8 rook. my insurance policy of rd4 is about to pay dividends i think! black: qg5 is interesting! after  26… f6 27. rxe8+ qxe8 28. rxf6  black seems to have an advantage though the kingside threat is impressive  white:  although white considered the moves that rybka prefers here, notabley qd2, qd3 or rxe8+, the exchange doesn’t seem to leave white with any real advantage.   however, rybka thinks these lines are still better than the above, e.g.     1. = (0.25): 26.qd2 rd4 27.rxd4 exd4 28.rxd4  4. = (0.08): 26.rxe8+ qxe8 27.qd3 rd4 28.rxd4 exd4 29.qxd4        compared with:   5. = (-0.02): 26.r8d7 qh4   white thought having the pieces out gave them more power to threaten black with possible mate.                   note:  this move is a trap:  26. r6d7 qxd8 27. rxd8 rxd8, costing white the two connected rooks in exchange for a queen, leaving blacks’ rooks ready to pounce on the back rank.  black and white had longs discussions over whether this was playable for white, and eventually agreed it was not.  rybka rates it at   -1.53. white:  qh4 is best move.  everything else leads to trouble.  that’s why white liked the last move.  a less astute black would have probably lost the game here.      rybka also advocated one more move we probably would never have considered:  qf8!  but it rates it slightly less at 0.13 compared to almost exactly even for qh4. white:  rybka prefers these moves:  qf3 (0.04), rxa7(-0.13), a3(-0.14), f3(-0.20), qd2(-0.29),b5(-0.35).  g3 it rates as -0.50.  white doesn’t discover the back door attack on the a-file until next move.   white had considered rxa7 but only to get a pawn which seemed insufficient.  white wanted something grander.     the idea was to chase the queen from protecting against rd8.  if 27. … qxh3 28. rd8, and black was going to lose the rook at e8.  however, rybka says that rf8 addresses the problem., but after a difficult fight for survival:  29. rxf8+ kxf8 30. kxd8 qg8+ 31. qg5+ f6 32. qxg7 kxd8 33. qg8+ ke7  34. qxc4.  white’s being down a pawn puts white behind at -0.44. black:qh5?? what was black thinking! qxh3 is much stronger  white:  rybka advocated  qxh3, the move white expected.   white: white is now probably at the peak of this game.   rybka ranks the position at 0.84.  unfortunately, finding the best move is no easy task!   white considered many moves and lines:  28. qf3 qxf3 29. rd8 f6 30. rxe8+ kf7 31. rde6 rc1+ 32. kh2 qh1#  28. qd2 kf8  29.  rd8 f6 30. rxe8+ qxe8 31. rd8 rd4 32. rxd4 exd4              33. qxd4                              28. g4  qh4  29.qg3 rc1+ 30. rd1 rxd1+ 31. rxd1                28. rd8 then kf8, f6 or f5.                28. rd8 f6  29. qb3 b5                28. re7 kf8     in the investigation of 28. re7 kf8, white discovered that 29. rxa7 did more than gain a pawn, but enables a  backdoor attack with 30. qa3.  why waste a move with re7?  why not go straight to rxa7 or qa3?                                 rybka says the best move is (white is still incredulous):   kg2 (0.84) or g4               (0.55).      white ultimately chose rxa7 over qa3, because he didn't want to tip his hand, and feared qxh3 would limit queen's ability to support an attack, having to focus instead on defence.  rybka gives rxa7 followed by qxh3 a score of 0.00—dead even.  black: yeh black is in trouble here. g4 was something i considered and worried about for a fair while - where's the queen to go? perhaps h3 hoping that the rook can make it to c2 and that white will move the queen? or that white's rook will neatly remove itself from the d file so it can get out to help? but after that the move f6 is no longer as useful as it could be and white simply picks off the pawns on teh queenside and marches home - there's just not a nice answer to g4 here. black: why do i persist in ignoring the h3 pawn? mainly because i'm too woried about a queenside pawnstorm - and also the possibility of a queen supporting the rooks after qxb6. the main idea behind this move though was essentially agressive in nature - i want to get that rook ont eh back and seventh rank. and this way (i thought) meant that white couldn't stop a potentially tempo winning attack on the 1st rank.  white:  rybka agrees that qxh3 was the best choice.  white was pleased this less important pawn was captured instead. black: white lets black off here a bit, g4 is much stronger.  white:  although this is the attack white longed for, rybka say, no, focus on pawns instead.   g4 scores  0.68.  this move rates -1.75, because of  29. ... rb1+ 30. kg2 31. ra8 qe4+!  which disables white's attack.   white had overlooked qe4+ or qf1+ (a less attack keeping things at even) and expected to gain the pinned rook. white:  black appears to have overlooked the prospects of the rb1+ line as well.  black: i considered it- in fact it was one of the main points of rxb4 - however i hadn't noticed the way that the queen could get in to help as i had my eyes on h3 (finally) and hadn't seen that on e2 i could do just as much damage. darn. white:  once again rybka says g4 is the move, somehow making the ra8 attack work or force black's queen to exchanged with white's rook.  rybka rates the move g4 at 4.18.  taking the rook instead only leaves white at a slight disadvantage  (-0.41). white over looked 31. ... qe5 and perhaps also f5 or f6 to protect the rook. white:  rybka now rates the position at -1.05 black: ?? this is a blunder for white. with rxe8 this would have been much closer.  white:   agrees.  white flustered by the unexpected qe5, hurriedly moves thinking queens can't be exchanged.  thinking rxr would be mate, forgetting, qf8 defence.  rybka advocate qa4.  instead, the position is rated as -3.2. white: the rest from here is easy for black with those two passed pawns. the best white can do is force black to retreat the king and capture a kingside pawn before helping the passed pawns to the end as with a move like 40. g4 etc. though this is a temporary reprieve, as … c3 traps the white king within two squares of c1.  black: it wasn't completely obvious that black could take the queen - it occurred to me only after i was almost resigned to loosing a rook! however i think this is the move that removes all white's chances in this game - the c, d and b pawns are just too strong against that lonely a pawn.  however a very close game - with white more often than not ahead.  the rest from here is easy for black with those two passed pawns. the best white can do is force black to retreat the king and capture a kingside pawn before helping the passed pawns to the end as with a move like 40. g4 etc. though this is a temporary reprieve, as from 37 onwards … c3 traps the white king within two squares of c1. white resigns 0-1 
-------------------------------------
this is a game from the 60th gameknot tournament, expert section. i was black in this game. i played quite well overall, but the game was pretty messy and one slip could have proven fatal, which is indeed what happened. once again, comments always welcome and thank you for taking the time of going through the game. the grand prix attack. not so popular nowadays as 2.nf3 or 2.c3, i'm not sure how it compares to other possibilities like 2.d4 or 2.nc3. one of the main responses. black doesn't waste time in challenging for the centre. other possibilities include 2...e6, 2...nc6 or 2...g6. a more common response is 3.exd5, but the text move is also playable. i'm not so sure about this trade, to be honest, though i guess white envisioned this becoming a more closed game, where knights would be better than bishops. also, black's light-square bishop is technically a bad bishop, but so is white's dark-squared one. potentially preventing the same move by black, which would open up the a8-h1 diagonal for black's bishop. heading for the f5-square. 9.g4, kicking the knight away, would probably be too risky. black would counter with 9...nh4 and then 10.o-o h5 and black's game is good. preventing g2-g4, thus enabling the knight to remain on f5, as well as preparing to advance the pawn. this manoeuvre is actually more common on the opposite side of the board, as in certain king's indian variations, where black will place his knight on c5 and solidify it with a5 to prevent b2-b4. maybe a loss of time, white could simply continue with his development with something like 10.na3 or try 10.qe1 as in the game. white was probably trying to avoid a pin on the a7-g1 diagonal after a possible qb6 and cxd4. in certain lines ng3+ might now become a threat. 10...qb6 was also possible. preparing to develop the bishop on a3. again 11.na3 was an alternative. here i decided i would castle queenside (which isn't customary in the sicilian for black, but rules are meant to be broken, right?) and try to attack on the kingside. 11...qa5 was also possible, attacking the c3-pawn if the b1-knight should move, as was 11...qb6. i decided for a less direct approach. white can't simply develop automatically with nbd2, since that would run into the ne3 fork. so, 12.qe1 protects the e3 square and prepares nbd2. on the downside, the queen was also protecting d4, which might come under attack after something like cxd4, qb6 etc. of course, black has to be wary of opening the c-file after the intended queenside castling. white might have tried 12.qd3, protecting both e3 and d4. maybe white wasn't sure about placing the queen and the rook on the same diagonal. following my plan, but here i missed a cute tactic: 12...bb5! 13.rf2 (13.rg1?? ng3+) ng3+! 14.kg1 ne4 15.rb2 (15.rc2 bd3) and white's position with the fianchettoed rook is really awkward, though he should eventually untangle. it's often inadvisable to venture into tactical skirmishes before completing one's development, so 12...o-o-o it is. maybe 13...bb5 was an alternative, but again i preferred to simply develop. (?) i'd call this a mistake, it invites bxg5, ridding black of the two bishops and giving rise to a bishops of opposite colour position, but it also loses a pawn. so, i would recommend 14.ba3 or 14.a4 here. the obvious move, but 14...cxd4! was even stronger and more precise. i didn't even look at it, since i was mainly concerned with the obvious nxf7 threat. so, 14...cxd4 15.nxf7 (15.cxd4 bxg5 16.fxg5 nxd4 transposes into the game continuation) dxc3 16.nf3 d4 and the two pawns are really strong, the exchange would hardly be a sacrifice there. transposing to the line i mentioned after 14...bxg5. white could have tried 16.rxf5!? exf5 17.cxd4 instead, but in any case black is already better, which means white's choice of opening probably wasn't the best. and black is simply up a pawn. of course, now comes the hard part, how to try and convert this advantage into a win. attacking both d4 and f7, but black has a simple response. retreating the knight to safety, as well as threatening 18...ng3+. sort of a proof that 10.kh1 might not have been the best. winning the second pawn. advancing the passed pawn as well as opening up the bishop's diagonal. unpinning the bishop, but that wasn't really such a problem. 20...h3 was also possible, where after 21.g3 (21.rc5? qxh2+!!) ne3 22.rc5 rd5 white is also on the ropes. the immediate 20...ne3 is also playable, 21.rc5 qc7 22.qxf7 nxf1 23.qxe6+ kb8 24.nxf1, where black is up an exchange and has the dangerous passed d-pawn. white obviously doesn't want trades as in 22.qf3 qxf3. maybe not so wise in retrospect, it wasn't a bad move at all, but going for tactics probably wasn't the correct approach here. i think 22...f6, preparing e5, was the way to go. white is trying hard to hang on. why not 24...nxc4, simplifying when ahead? surely that would have been the more pragmatic decision. (??) trying to both preserve the bishop and defend f7, but i completely overlooked white's reply. 25...ng3!, threatening ne2+ and forcing 26.rxg3, was much better, as was 25...d3 (26.nxf7? nd4). funny how both times white threatened the fork on f7 i panicked, went for the safe approach and directly prevented it, instead of looking at the position more thoroughly for possible tactics. the first time on move 14 i didn't really commit an error this way, but this time i did and it was costly. i guess what we can learn from all of this is that we should never react automatically and always look for hidden possibilities. ! - suddenly it dawned on me, the queen has nowhere to go! i was so demoralized  i didn't even try to fight on with 26...qd6 27.rc8+ rxc8 28.bxd6 nxd6, but simply resigned, angry and disappointed with myself. white would be better there, but i could still give him a run for his money. nevertheless, i congratulate my opponent and praise his resourcefulness even when his position was on the brink of disaster. i had to demonstrate my win and i didn't, once again proving lasker's maxim that “the hardest game to win is a won game”. 
-------------------------------------
my opponent opens with what i consider to be the strongest opening move.  the king's pawn avoids many of the slower manoeuvrings of other openings, allowing white to concentrate on fast attacking play. i respond with the sicilian.  it creates an unbalanced board, allowing black to attempt to call some of the shots early on in the game. white preserves the option of an open or closed sicilian.  black must now be cautious. black is looking to counter white’s expected fianchetto with one of his own after 4.g3 b5. i think 4.g3 was the better move here, not really sure what the aim of white's was.  i suspect it was a passive move, waiting to see what black's intentions were.  but i think this move tosses away the advantage white has by virtue of the colour of his pieces. black responds with d5,  showing a real willingness to contest over the central squares. pawn exchange.  white is in danger of losing control of the match. both players castle.  white is slightly cramped in his positioning. black threatens white's knight, beginning to take the initiative away from white and assuming control of the match. white offers an exchange of knights, which black eagerly accepts. !!! oh dear.  white was evidently thinking of an exchange of knights again, but overlooked the fact that the initiative was with black allowing for 12...exf3 13.bxf3 nd4 which gives black a +2 material advantage. black threatens white's bishop. black wins after white's timeout. 
-------------------------------------
now that i have time to think i'm reviewing certain moves from this blitz game.  possible 5...bg4 what did i ever do with that lsb?  took until move 19 to get it going and then it played an important role on the e6-b3 diagonal.  better than ...bg4 would have done. computer doesn't like this move but it's blitz and i'm looking at that n on the q-side anyway.  i keep preparing the central break.  he should do the same.  actually, b4 or a4 would have also been good ideas for him i believe.  i'm ready but computer doesn't like it.  i was thinking his last 2 moves were pretty defensive.  the position opened up as i thought but the moves were played very quick.  i'm sure he played 18.e4 for tempo but d4 would be better.  and really i should have responded ...rd6 but my head started spinning so the simple ...rd8 was played.  can only re-deploy to c2 but then where?  in the game he just returns it to f3 lol  so that’s where my lsb ended up.  i was preparing for mobilization of my q-side pawns.  objectively better to activate pieces along open lines.  he’s allowing me lots of time.  wanted to move my b-pawn but can’t remember why?  ...rc3 is great but no rush to play it.  he’s challenging me but i’m pretty strong over there.  his poor r is just sitting there.  now my r has strong purpose. or d3 because it gets captured on move 33 and it's a valuable passed pawn.  wrong.  keep the r on the b-file.  or …ra4.  good.  …ra4 is much better...almost winning.  pins the r!  …ra4 just never dawned on me.  too quick.  requires deep analysis though.  computer really likes …ra3+ but the obvious kb2 needs a lot of thought to refute.  that’s better.  better is …rg3…rxg2+  no need.  plus his k-side pawns are strong.  not bad.  check out …kd4 and then what?  nope.  allows the next move.  …rxg2 was needed but i see what i was thinking…trying to promote the b-pawn.  i timed out.  he played well especially with almost 200 elo difference.  he had 9 seconds left.  
-------------------------------------
his play seems very cautious. probably better is c4, but this is sound. ? i am not sure why he decided to let me follow through on my idea although i do not think he could stop it. ? ?? played very quickly.  perhaps the reason behind the g3, but i do not see him getting an advantage from the rook on f2 especially when he cannot double his rooks on the file anytime soon. so far it is just a dance. waiting oops! i prefer black in this position. and declining rook trade but accepting bishop trade. no to the bishop trade.  yes to the rook trade.  26.e4? rxc1+ 27.rxc1 bxc1. a touch surprised this move was this slow in coming. waiting and improving. ?? yes to the bishop trade! no to the bishop trade! yes to the bishop trade! adiós bishops. rc2?  this endgame is black's to win. no rc2 now. white is deteriorating. offering him a noose. "i like the gallows!" "ha!" "oops" #

el blanco avanza el peon central para abrir el juego a su dama y su alfil una jugada de desarrollo del negro  la posición se podría llamar clásica  el alfil apunta a la casilla f7.  este movimiento le abre la diagonal al alfil blanco. es como que le facilita el juego o lo potencia  el blanco avanza el peon para poner en bateria su dama y su alfil  esta jugada del caballo es mala, por dos motivos. el primer motivo es que le quita la salida al rey . el segundo motivo es que no defiende el punto f7. era mejor el caballo a h6. esta es una amenaza directa de jaque mate.  esta jugada es mala. la jugada era el peon a d5  
-------------------------------------
ultima jugada del libro  alternative variation: 16. dxc6 $5 bxc6 17. c5 dxc5 18. bxe5 $16  alternative variation: 17... cxd5 [sería un desahogo] 18. cxd5 rc4 $14  alternative variation: 19. nc3 [y el resultado es claro: el blanco ganará] dxc4 20. nd5 $18 [mdlc: había visto esta variante, pero no sabía como continuar, y tenía miedo del peón en c4.  en realidad el plan ganador sería atacar el peon en c4. si las negras utilizan un cadena de peones para defender c4. las blancas deben atacar la base de cadena negra, y finalmente atacar el peón en d6.]  mdlc. mi evaluación en esta posición era:  el negro tiene el alfil negro que no tiene juego y lo obstruyen sus propios peones. en cambio las blancas,  pueden movilizar el alfil a f2 y atacar los peones doblados y el peón débil en d6.  la dificultad de las blancas se debe a que no tienen el dominio de la columna c, y esperaba lentamente que en el juego las blancas llegara a dominarla. intuía que mi rival era más táctico que posicional.  mdlc. el jugador de las negras le suena el cuelular. el árbitro da como ganador a las blancas  
-------------------------------------
playing the sicilian at the time i liked this move but now i think i like a queen move better. thought about developing queen to b6 or bishop to b7 but didn´t like his bishop having an outpost so i decided to trade instead. don´t like the pressure of his queen so making him back off. once again removing a piece that has an outpost on that square. however i think this was not the best move because after capturing with pawn and forcing my rook to move i have no squares for my knight after pawn to c3. wanted to put some pressure on his king. i needed to protect pawn and allow knight to have an escape square after c3. this becomes a problem later being on the same file as rook. didn´t feel my knight was safe on the other square and wanted to relocate it as soon as possible. after studying this position for a long time i felt like his attack was too strong and i was going to lose unless i slowed it down. my pieces were in really bad positions. i felt the following move a rook sacrifice was needed to save the game. moving queen out of bishop pin with tempo. needed to block either rook or bishop and felt this move was the better move as it also stops a future threat of rook to g1. attacking rook in order to save pawn. i realize he may have thoughts of a discovered threat but don´t see him having anything immediately and this move was practically forced. i moved my king to unpin my pawn and attack his rook at the same time. realize he blundered and acted on it. in order to avoid losing queen to rook f5 i did not go to f8 but rather g7 at this point i realize i have won the game. here i had two options trade queens in order to avoid any chances of a draw knowing i had a winning position with my three passed pawns or go up a rook. i felt the queen trade was a simpler win though i believe i would have won taking the rook as well. easy endgame win from here since my passed pawns can´t be stopped and king can´t even take a pawn without me queening the other passed pawn. so i just go straight to the side he has more pawns to create a threat on that side of the board as well winning the game. the only thing i needed to be careful about was capturing correctly so that he doesn´t create a passed pawn that my king can´t stop. and here he resigns realizing he can´t stop  threats from both sides of the board neither capture the g5 pawn or lose to h pawn queening. 
-------------------------------------
 esta jugada la hice sin analizar mucho y obedecio a que me empezaba a constreñir lentamente ante la ofensiva blanca y no queria perder terreno. mi caballo retrocederia y el flanco rey quedaria a merced del ataque de los alfiles. aun no tengo plan. obligado. i didn't saw this move and i thought my bishop was out of the game.  my next moves only try to save the bishop. i decided not to castling, because of the white attack.
-------------------------------------
 me gusto mucho esta partida pues despues de darla casi por perdida, llego la esperanza. por eso, creo que al nivel nuestro, cuando la diferencia de material es pequeña, se puede luchar por el empate o incluso la victoria.
-------------------------------------
i don't make any inaccuracies in this opening, but slowly my first-move advantage slips away and black gets quite a lead. and then messes it up - or does he? unusually passive reply from my opponent! it does stop my knight getting ideas about going to g5, as if it would! perhaps 5.nc3 was better? i didn't fancy the tactical complications should black take the e-pawn and then play d5. we both develop normally, and i see the advantage of black having the dark-squared bishop on e7, behind the pawn chain. it doesn't get driven back and can join a k-side attack. now i'm the one being over-cautious, preventing the pin on the knight. but black has more aggressive plans than a mere pin. attempting to double my pawns and removing the bishop that's aimed at the king is not a bad idea! i can't prevent the exchange, but i can ensure my pawns don't get doubled. preventing 9...b5. but i've rather handed the initiative to black. another attempt to double pawns. so i retreat. allowing the queen the option of heading to the q-side and preparing for a possible d5. i get back to f3, having made four moves to prevent the doubling of my pawns, which doesn't see too good a deal, in retrospect. but now my dark-squared bishop is free. back on the q-side, black is opening a file for his rook. i can't see a problem with allowing an open a-file, since my rook is on it as well. this seems the best square for the bishop, even though it doesn't actually threaten anything. and i have to move it to give my rook a defence. black has conceded control of the a-file, but taken my queen away from the main game. black is looking for exchanges, being happier in the endgame. for the present i want to keep my bishop on the board. i can see black is setting up an attack on my h-pawn, which i had no real need to advance. i don't fancy allowing him to open up my position, even for a point advantage... so i defend with ym king too. black has built up a strong k-side attack now. one of those bishops has to go; having two lined up side by side is too dangerous. black cuts off my bishop's retreat. this drives the knight to f6... where i can exchange and avoid the bishop being trapped. adding to the defence of the h-pawn. black builds up against it. i can't see i've done anything wrong, but i'm under a lot of pressure! my king retreats. despite having made no inaccuracies, the computer has me a massive -1.55 behind at this point. and then, according to the analysis, black blows it... wiping out his advantage with the following, probably drawn, result: … bxh3 24. gxh3 rxh3 25. qg2 rh6 26. qf3 rg6+ 27. kh2 rh6+ 28. kg2 rg6+ 29. kh2... and we repeat. but wait!  when i actually play the obvious capture, i'm down -4.38! good to know even a computer analysis can be wrong. and instead of retreating as per the computer's drawn repeat of moves, black advances his f-pawn and i'm in real trouble. my only escape square! black gets ready to pin my queen... i thought i'd escaped here, because i have a check on c8 if the queen moves... the check only works if the queen helpfully goes here, instead of d8 there's no chance of a repeat of checks though, since the rook can block. in case i get lucky and black plays 32...rh6 right away.... before guarding the square with the queen as well. panic, and i've lost my rook and the game. 33.ra1 with the threat of check on a8 might have given me a little more time. but now i'm too far down in material... and preparing a fairly pointless back-rank check... just forces a queen exchange. i carry on for a few moves even getting rid of a few pawns isn't going to help. black allows me one final pawn to seize. but as the others must fall, i resign. curious that the move the computer has as black's first error was actually the move that won the game! beware the computer analysis!

-------------------------------------
 a large crowd of online kibitzers and spectators were drawn to the bout. i was probably a slight favorite going into the match, but with humans there is the, well … human factor!  
-------------------------------------
 this defense prepared before-hand is known as the caro-kann defense - a very solid system that has a reputation for being effective against attacking maniacs and computers. a very wise choice by cm9k - this move tends to opens the game up and creates more tactical possibilities than lines like 3 nc3. a slightly more adventurous is 6…bb4 but i decided to stay within myself and keep things calm and conservative. i was happy to see this move, even though i had never encountered it before in a serious game. the alternative developing moves 8 bd3 and 8 bc4 pose more problems for black.  
-------------------------------------
 the problem with this checking move is that it leads to early simplification. white, with his superior control of territory, should avoid exchanges. that's chess 1 on 1. black, with the slightly more cramped position, benefits from them. i thought about playing 8…bd7 here but i was a little nervous about white playing 9 bxd7  qxd7 10 ne5.  but really, that line's nothing for white. black simply answeres 10…nxc3 11 bxc3 qd5 with a good game. 9.ne5? 	...
-------------------------------------
 there is a  basic principle in the opening that a player should not move the same piece twice unless he has a very good reason.  cm’s move does come with a threat, 10 nxc6, but that can be easily parried.  there is no long-term positive benefit that result from this violation of principle, so 9 ne5 must be classified a mistake. 9. ...	bd7 
-------------------------------------
 this is a very agreable move from black’s point of view. black’s pawn structure is strengthened markedly. he once had two weak queenside pawns and now only has one. further, black’s control of the center has been increased - squares like e4 and c4 have come under black’s possesion.  
-------------------------------------
 black is clearly better now for the following reasons.  first, his pawn structure is iron-clad. white cannot dent that compact chain of pawns. second, black can attack two weaknesses on whites’s side of the board. the d4 pawn is isolated and weak and white’s queenside survivors are also vulnerable.
-------------------------------------
 18 qxb4 axb4 suddenly opens up the a-file to black’s benefit. white is unable to shake off the pressure now because its pawns are just too weak. 18.rfd1 	rfb8 
-------------------------------------
 cm has set a trap that might have worked against a less experience opponent. if black mindlessly grabs the pawn with 19…qxb2?? white wins with 20 rc8  rxc8 20 qxb2. a strong program like chessmaster never blunders a pawn for nothing. 19. ...	qa4 
-------------------------------------
 it is very important for black to remove the threat of back-rank mate.  this eliminates the constant worry about sudden cheap tricks. speaking of cheap tricks, black must resist 20…qxa2?? 21 ra3 qxb2 22 rc8 !! rxc8 23 qxb2 and white wins. white should have avoided this move until absolutely forced. a better continuation was to improve his king position, starting with 21 g3, followed by kg2. black is finally in position to play the long desired … a4 to create a lasting weakness on white's queenside. a terrible blunder would be 22…a4?? 23 rc8  kh7 24 qxb4 rxb4 25 rxa8 and white wins. i can safely say that after this move white is lost as the coming endgame is hopeless. white should have tried the active defense 24 bxh6! qxd4 25 rd3 qe4. black has an edge, but white may gain some counter-play later on because of the noticeable weakening of black’s king position. white’s defenses are over-stretched. he cannot defend both the d-pawn and the b-pawn. white’s last hope rests with this passed b-pawn, but black’s king easily intercepts it. now white’s proud b-pawn has become a target.  black will soon devour the pawn and then turn his attention to mobilizing his large kingside majority. chessmaster makes a final bid for counterplay. he hopes to either splinter my kingside pawns or create a target for attack. i decided to give back the relatively unimportant h-pawn and begin the decisive advance of my chain gang of pawns. white reduces the material deficit to just one pawn, but the time required to take the h-pawn allows black to roll his pawns forward. 42. ...	d4 
-------------------------------------
this was a tournament game, my opponent was the highest rated in the group and is one of the highest rated players that i have beaten, at the start of the tournament he was in the 1700's. for me one of the highlights of the game was a forced march down 3/4 the board by my opponents king to his ultimate demise. i've played the scandinavian with varied success against higher rated opponents, it seems to catch some of them out. this is the lasker variation i haven't seen this move often but its still book, i'm not clear of the purpose of this move for white this takes us out of the gameknot database. which only gives 8. d4 though i am sure that move is to come this was a totally unexpected blunder, the analysis prefers  9. nge4 nxe4 10. nxe4 bc7 11. d4 na6 this seems to me to be to discourage qe5 but i am looking to play qc7 to add to the knights defence i think with hindsight nxe2 might have been better here being ahead in material i am more than happy to exchange.  looking to get my lsb on the h1-a8 diagonal although i am happy to exchange i would like to keep my bishops as long as i am able i'm not sure if white overlooked this but the computer didn't give any judgement at this point analysis declares this a mistake by black, though i am not at all clear why. the computer gives mistake: +5.86 » … fxe4 21. bxe4 rab8 22. dxc5 bxe4 23. qxe4 rf6 24. cxb6 nxb6 25. rd3 nc4 26. f4 nxa3 27. rfd1 qb6+ 28. kg2 qb7 29. qxb7 rxb7   the computer prefers kh8 21. g4 cxb4 22. cxb4 rac8 23. kh1 fxe4 24. bxe4 ba6 25. rfe1 qf4 26. bc6 nf6 27. rxe6 qxg4 28. qxg4 nxg4 29. rxe7 rxc6 my strategy now is to simplify and try to not give white a chance to get back into the game this ties whites f rook to the defence of a pawn for now. the power of these rooks will become clear at the end of the game i dont understand this move at all, i was expecting white to push his passed pawn on d i'm happy to be greedy, whites pawn advantage is reducing which suits me breaking the pin on my rook, white needs to decide how to defend his f pawn heading to g4 to pressure the f pawn this is a mistake, best is … rxf2 33. rxf2 rxe8 34. rf1 nxh2 35. qe6 rc8 36. qf7 qxf7 37. rxf7 kg8 38. rd7 bxg3 39. rxa7 bb8 40. rd7 nf3+ 41. kg2  at the time i wanted to avoid fxe8 and overlooked rxf2 as an option hoping to budge the rook i was quite pleased when i saw this, clearly the white queen can avoid the obvious threat, the real threat is bxf4, gxf4 forking the rooks i think i would have preferred qa3 here, though the computer calls this a mistake preferring 37. qe1 bxf4 38. re8 bd6 39. rxf8+ rxf8 i'm not sure that black could have prevented this probably best not to take, but what else can white do? according to the analysis his best option was 8. kg2 bxg3 39. kxg3 nf4 40. re1 qxd4 but to me that looks uncomfortable for white. this is a blunder for white though i of course didn't see that, i wanted to avoid the pawn fork from nxe6, dxe6. the computer gives  blunder: +24.16 » 39. d5 nxe6 40. qc4 rf1+ 41. kg2 ng5 42. qd3 r1f3 43. qxf3 rxf3 44. re6 qxd5 45. re8+ rf8+ 46. kh2 rxe8 47. h4 re2+ 48. kg1 best: +15.66 » 39. kh2 nxe2 40. rxe2 rf2+ 41. rxf2 rxf2+ 42. kg3 qxd4 43. qf3 rxf3+ 44. kxf3 qd5+ 45. kf4 g5+ 46. ke3 qxb5 47. ke4 qe8+ 48. kf5 qd7+ 49. kf6 here the analysis gives mate in 12 which i will leave as an excercise for the reader my intent here was qxh3 bringing my queen into the thick of it. the computer gives mate in 11. the computer gives this as mate in 5 which is quite a jump from previously. fortunately for me i did see this one and programmed in some conditional moves the white king starts his march up the board i find it somehow satisfying to get mate with a pawn, even more so due to the difference in ratings.  thanks for reading please comment on where and why i could have improved

trying a different approach against my good ol pal jack. saw this opening somewhere on gameknot. figured i’d give it a try. believe it’s called walking the plank... still going to walk the plank... see, just going for a walk... jacks next move was what i had in mind... farewell soldier... young lad died with cause. was hoping jack would play nxh6 now hopefully all goes well...never opened this way...should be interesting  your turn bishop joe.....a sacrifice is needed. perfect, took his knight and now forces him to play g7xbh6 bishop joe served his purpose. now queen big birtha is thirsty for blood! die pawn! good ol jack up to his tricks again....as dopey as i been playing, wasn’t going to let this new opening be over that fast. great move jack. but i caught it! queen bertha calls out for knight in shining armor. yes m’lady? dang it.....was hoping to capture that rook some how...but aww well. bertha knows she’s under attack. but she’s not sweating it. bertha pulls back. enemy is bringing reinforcements... as do i... king jack’s queen retreats for the moment. king jack....i may as well be king jon. now our kings have names. i advanced my knight. at this point, was still feeling this game out.  saw that coming... ok...at this point...wasn’t sure what to do. later realized i probably could of played a better move than to snatch jacks bishop. just felt it was a good idea to play with less pieces. hmmm... thought for a minute and i saw at this point jack was going to put the pressure on with his knight... let me just say, jack (my opponent) and i have played many games against each other. so we kind of know what the other is thinking. at least that’s what i like to think. queen bertha decides to pull back yet again. king jack decides to go inside for a cup a coffee... me too... here she comes again... at this point... i know i’m playing accordingly. i move my knight... then it’s all over. so, soldier e2, i need you to step into the front lines. ok....another move made....still going to play safe. another soldier steps up. ok...here comes that knight pressure i was talking about. bishop mike. “i need you to make room in the in the back rank” says queen bertha. “ king jacks knight is planning on threatening our rooks. i need to protect them.” you can smell the stink coming from king jacks knights mouth. “greetings m’lady.” both rooks reply at the same time. king jacks orders must of gotten misled. black pawn jumped to soon. with that, came a swift death of king jacks knight. decapitated! blacks queen couldn’t bare the site of watching her final knight get slaughtered. she pulls back. queen big bertha had enough of the rooks gazing at her beauty. she moves out.  that pawn caused a lot of trouble for king jack. definitely a benedict arnold.  i don’t like traitors. he must die.  this will be king jacks final move. his stronghold is fallen. queen bertha gives king jack an ultimatum and accepts. it’s all over. victory!

believe it or not most top level gm's have ditched f4 for nf3. this is because of black's recent successes against the f4 lines. still the f4 lines remain common in amateur play because most black players have not kept up with modern theory.   at this juncture white does not have to play e4 but instead can play 7.g3 with very interesting play for both sides. the advantage of 7. g3 is that white steers the game into more positional style of play. however, the meekness of 7. g3 should not be underestimated! as it is notorious for it's complex middle game  more common are 8.h3; 8.bd3 and 8.be2. the idea is to test stalhandske's knowledge of the modern benoni. if he is abreast this move should be no problem, matter of fact black can get some very good chances out of it.   alternative variation: 8... a6 9. qa4+ bd7 10. qb3 b5 11. bxd6 b4 [!?] 12. na4 nxe4 13. qe3 bxa4  a normal manouever for white in the modern benoni bf4 lines. white wants to place a knight on c4 where it can attack d6 and defend e4 from a more active outpost.   this move and ...ne8 are black's latest attempt to refute white's bf4 ideas.   ?! the whole point of 9...ng4 is to try and prevent white from playing nc4 easily. 10...qf6 actually hinders black's development and makes the queen and knight targets.  alternative variation: 10... ne5 [=] 11. o-o f5 12. h3 fxe4 13. bg3 (13. be3 re8 14. ndxe4 nf7)13... bf5  !?  forces that exchange but it does little to clear the air. after the exchange the position is quite complex.   after a series of forced exchanges the dust has settled somewhat. leaving white with a potentially dangerous majority in the center. but black has better piece mobility and a slightly superior pawn structure but his position is quite passive. the result is semi-equality with better attacking chances for white.   !? a risky gamble. black gives up a pawn in order for the opportunity to destroy white's pawn structure.  alternative variation: [possibly better is ] 19... h3 20. nf3 nf6 21. e5 ne4 [⩲]  attacking c3 and forcing black's next few moves.  alternative variation: 23. rxb7 [?] 23... bc8 24. bxf6+ kxf6 25. e5+ kg7 26. rc7 bxe5 [=]  white has managed to hold onto his powerful center.  meanwhile, black has converted the b-pawn into a highly dangerous past c-pawn. black needs to get his rook behind the c-pawn in order to simplify into a slightly inferior rook endgame.   black is down by two pawns and is in danger of losing. however,  black can force the game to a peaceful end if he adheres to the golden rules of rook endgames. #1 centralize your king #2 control the center. #3 keep your rook active and cut off the opponent king from meeting up with a pawn. #3 you need at least two pawn advantage to win.   my winning chances are hinged on keeping my  2 pawn advantage.   ? bad, black needs to adhere the the three golden rules. #1 centralize your king.  #2 active rook  #3 control the centre alternative variation: 32... kf6 [!] 33. a4 ke5 34. h4 rd3 35. kf2 ra3 36. g3 ra2+ 37. kf3 ra3+ 38. kg2 ra2+ 39. kf3 ra3+ [=][and that is how it is done folks!]  !?  !  alternative variation: 34... g4 [?!] 35. rb4 g3 36. hxg3 rxd5 37. kf2 rd2+ 38. kf3 kg5 39. g4 [!]  ! for the win. black can no longer capture either pawn and therefore loses. this highlights the importance of adhering to the golden rules of rook endings.   black resigns. both of his pieces are unable to move and are in zugwig  
-------------------------------------
mind white's next several moves, as he was deliberately being coy about the eventual post for his d-pawn, to keep black off-balance about the best placement for his pieces. i've noticed in tournament games (back in the days i was still going to every tournament i could) the stronger players like experts and lower-rated masters frequently resorted to this kind of calculated slipperiness, to lure lower-rated sorts into misplaying the opening, thus setting themselves up for a quick knockout or at least a long-term positional disadvantage with a nearly guaranteed victory for the higher-rated player. ...never happened to me, of course.  ;-) this should signal white's intent to play his pawn to d4, but it's still not obvious since the advance of the king's rook pawn is a common prophylactic move. in this case the move takes g4 away from black's knight. black thinks to saddle white with a d-file isolani; but white's continuation will give black an isolated pawn of his own to worry about, if only for a moment. white improves black's pawn structure for the benefit of closing off the d-file, making black's kb a spectator for a while. white's own pieces, meanwhile, are free to seek happy squares. covering the kingside bases and also preparing to boot black's queen back behind her own lines where she belongs. -- ? -- a mistake. black helps white redevelop his kb to its best square and secure an open file for a rook, all free of charge. pretty much a "box" move. (that's "chess informant-speak" for  - the symbol used to mean "only move.") 21. ...qd3 22. qd3 bd3 ends up losing one of black's q-side pawns by force, depending on the variation. the problem with the text is that even though it saves material, it also cedes a positional advantage to white. black is in a minor bind. feinting at the a-pawn ... ...which black rightly ignores. still ... black hasn't quite glimmered on to the fact that white doesn't care about the b-pawn because he's after black's king. surprisingly better than 34. qe5+: white will still be able to call check on the diagonal, and now he gets a file to work with too. -- ! -- white threatens the very scary ra8-qh8 mate. -- !! -- renewing the threat, this time on the h-file. and black resigns. white wins the queen.

hi everyone!  i was thinking about the thread in my club about which piece you would rather have in a b v n endgame.  many people would say the bishop!  well, i had the bishop, my opponent had the knight (and the lower chess rating at the time the game was played!) and i lost!  here is how it happened.  the first three moves are the french exchange variation so i start commentary on move 4. 4. nf3 - development. 6. nc3 - more development and pressure upon d5. 8. bxc4 - pawn trade. 9. ..... 0-0 - both sides tuck their kings away on the kingside. 11. bb3 - b3 is almost a standard square for a white bishop in the ruy lopez opening. 15. ..... nxd5 - there have been a plethora of exchanges and now there are two enemy cavalry standing side by side.  my knight could be driven off e5 at any time though.  xeno's cannot and this is the start of another attack of passivitis for yours truly. 18. nc4 - my knight moves off e5 to rid myself of that turbulent dark square prelate on b6. 21. ..... b5 - preparing nb6 which hits the squares a4 and c4 and there is nothing i can do about it. 23. .... qd5 - offering a queen trade which for once i decline! 25. bc3 - fou lenoir becomes a giant pawn! 28. ....rxe8 - rook trade. 30. qxe1 - after this queen trade i offer a draw which xeno declines.  over the next few moves he gives me the reason why he declined. 32. kf2 - i try and do the sensible thing, bring henry out into the centre asap, but alas that not so black beauty will soon impede his path. 35. .... ke6 - now out comes the bk and he will be more than a handful to me. 38. kd3 - not a bad square for henry and the endgame still looks equal, but looks can deceive. 40. ..... ne6 - it is that weak white isolani on d4 which will decide the game in xeno's favour.  it is beginning to dawn on me that i will soon be in a zugzwang.  note:  fou lenoir est tres fou!  porquoi?  il est sur les memes carrés coloeurs de ses pions!  the only pawn i have not on dark squares is the one on b3. 43. .... nd6 - heading for e4 - ouch and double ouch! 45. ..... c5!! - an excellent move.  although i will be pleased to get rid of that isolani it will undoable black's pawns on the queenside. 49. bd6 - black's pawns stay doubled but it will only be a matter of time before i lose the pawn on a3. 51. ke2 - if bxp?? then after 51. ...... nc5+ fou lenoir does not have a prayer! 53. bxb6 - the pawn on a3 goes for the pawn on b6.  alas, there is still the black pawn on b5 and as there are still 3 black pawns left on the board i cannot sac fou lenoir for the pawn.  it will only delay the end, not prevent it. 55. be5+ - a last gasp trap.  if nxb, trading down to k & p ending, the b pawn will crown but my e pawn would then crown the move after and material would be equal in the q and p ending.  it was not to be, xeno simply moved his king and as i said in a previous note, that pawn will crown unless fou lenoir sacrifices himself for it, and i reiterate it would only delay the end which i did not wish to do.  it was time to give in gracefully.  well played xenophon!  kind regards joanne

-------------------------------------
at a casual glance, the position looks dead drawn, and it is indeed hard to believe that anyone could win such a position against a world-class grandmaster such as polugaevsky. however, this is one of the reasons why i have selected it for inclusion in the present book. quite apart from larsen's superb handling of the ending, especially in the latter phase, the game is instructive in demonstrating that even apparently drawish positions can be won, with only the smallest error from the opponent, if one has the determination to try. in the first instance, the latter is the key. if one asks "how does one win such a position against a strong opponent?", the first stage of the answer is "by not agreeing a draw!" . in playing on, white does have a couple of small straws, from which to weave his basket. firstly, the black bishop on h7 is currently shut out of play by the white e4-pawn and will take some time to emerge into play. secondly, white has a space advantage, thanks to his pawns on e4 and f4.  with this move, white commences a plan of going after the black h-pawn. 30 ..kf7 would keep the enemy bishop out of f8, but white could strengthen his position by means of 31. be2 with the idea of transferring the bishop to c4 and threatening f4-f5. black's position would be rather passive and still somewhat uncomfortable. now the h-pawn is potentially vulnerable to a later white king march to h4. black continues to use the weakness of f4, to tie white down and hamper his attempts to make progress. 37 ...bd4+ 38. kxd4 kd6 was the alternative, when white retains some pressure after 39 e5+ fxe5+ 40. fxe5+ kc7 41. be4.  polugaevsky prefers to retain the dark-squared bishops, believing that it will be harder for white to penetrate the black position with both bishops on the board. now the exchange would be less dangerous for black, since after 41. bxd6 kxd6 42. kd4 e5+ it is white who has weaknesses on the dark squares. passive defence with 42 ...ke7 was also possible, but polugaevsky prefers to clarify the position. with the light-squared bishops having come off, black still has some worries over his h 5-pawn, which can prove vulnerable after kg3-h4. the position should still be drawn, but black has problems to solve. white's plan is bh6-g5, followed by kh4. polugaevsky puts his faith in counterattack. passive defence by 48 ...kf7 49. bg5 bc5 should also be adequate to draw. it is worth noting that the game had been adjourned around move 41, so polugaevsky was now following his home analysis. the fact that larsen still managed to win the position, even after his opponent had been able to analyse it at home, is a remarkable tribute to his endgame technique, and, in particular, his ability to continue to find ways to pose the maximum problems for black. polugaevsky later wrote that he had reached this position in his adjournment analysis, and had stopped here, convinced that the strength of his passed f-pawn should be sufficient to draw. this natural move proves to be the decisive mistake, although it takes some superbly subtle play by larsen to prove this. polugaevsky later claimed that 53 ...kf3 ! would have drawn, preventing the white king from coming back to help fight against the f-pawn. 54 ...be3? 55. bxa5 f3 56. kg3 wins easily. this simple variation illustrates a key point about the ending - black's f-pawn looks very dangerous, but is only so if the black king can reach the square e2. all the while the white pawn remains on c2, the only route for the king is the square e3, which white is able to patrol effectively with his bishop. this is the point. now 56. ...f2 is not dangerous because of 57. kg2 and after s7. ...f1q+ 58. kxf1 bxh4 59. bxa5 white wins easily. since he is unable to support the further advance of his e-pawn, the black king returns to perform defensive duties in stopping the white h-pawn. preparing to advance the h-pawn, without allowing ... 􀀿g s. all previous annotators of this ending, including both of the players, have assumed that black was lost after his 53rd move, and that larsen's play was a flawless demonstration of that fact. however, although the first part of the statement is true, the second is not. in view of the note to black's 62nd move, larsen's last has to be considered a serious mistake, which should cost the win. instead, 58 b4! wins, by setting up a second passed rook's pawn. after 58. ...axb4 (58 ...bxb4? 59. bxb4 axb4 60. kg3! wins at once) 59 h5! (59 a5? b3!) black simply cannot cope with both passed pawns, e.g. 59. ...kg5 (59. ...bd2 60. kg3 ke4 61. kf2 also wins) 60. bb6 c5 61. a5 c4 62. a6 b3 63. a7 b2 64. a8q b1q 65. qd5+ forces mate. the black king has finally gained access to the square e3, but it is now too late, as the following variation shows: 59. ..ke3 60. bc5+ ke2 (or 60. ...kd2 61. h6 kxc2 62. bd4 and the h-pawn promotes) 61. h6 f2 62. bxf2 bxf2 63 h7 bd4. now there follows the decisive break 64. b4! axb4 65. a5 and the bishop cannot stop both passed pawns, e.g. 65. ...kd2 66. a6 kxc2 67. a7 bxa7 68. h8q b3 69. qh7+ kc1 70. qxa7 b2 71. qc5+ and white wins in standard fashion, by forcing the black king i n front of the b-pawn and then bringing his own king closer. the bishop returns just in time, to close off the e3-square once again. in the meantime, the white h-pawn has advanced one rank closer to promotion. 62. ...ke3 is again a threat, and 62. h6? ke3 63. bg7 fails to 63. ...bxg7 64. hxg7 f2 when black should draw the queen ending. 62 ..ke3! is the way to draw. both larsen (in the danish magazine skakbladet 1966 pp 77-79) and polugaevsky (in his preface to the russian edition of larsen's best games collection, and in grandmaster preparation) dismiss this, on account of 63 bg7, when the e3- square is again denied to the black king, and the h-pawn threatens to advance. larsen adds the moves 63. ...bd4 64. h6 winning for white.  however, the merciless computer points out that 63 ...bc5! (or 63. ...bb6!) renews the threat of 64. ...ke3, and leaves white with nothing better than a repetition of moves after 64. bh6 (64. bf6? ke3 65. bh4 bd4 is also not winning for white; indeed, he may well be losing) 64 ...be3 etc. this possibility only came to light during the preparation of this book, and, as far as i am aware, it has not previously been pointed out anywhere else. after the text move, black is definitively lost. anticipating the threat of 63 ...bf4, and also preparing to annex the a5 pawn, after which white will have two passed rooks' pawns. black will finally win the white bishop for his e-pawn, but it is too late, because the two passed rooks' pawns will be too much for black's own bishop. a lovely final touch. white brings his king into contact with the f3-pawn, with gain of tempo. instead, all of white's subtle play hitherto would come to naught after 66. bh4? bg5 67. bg3 bf4 with a draw. again, the most precise. black will be driven into zugzwang. or 68 ..f2 69. bxf2 kxf2 70 c3 bxc3 71. h6 ke3 72. h7 kd3 73 a5 and wins and here it is. if black's bishop moves, it allows one of the white pawns to advance, whilst the black king has no waiting moves that do not lose the f-pawn. all beautifully done. now that the black pawn has been lured to c5, closing the a7-g1 diagonal, black's bishop cannot stop the a-pawn after 71 ...bxh6 72 a5 . superlative play by larsen, despite the lapse at move 58. 
-------------------------------------
this is a classic example of an extremely dynamic endgame. there is no time here for quiet manoeuvring or the gradual strengthening of the position. black is threatening to bring his knight to c6, neutralizing white's protected  passed pawn, when he would have nothing at all to fear. however, in entering this position, pillsbury had calculated a truly wonderful finish, which he had to see pretty much all the way to black's resignation the key breakthrough. the threat is 28. nf4 when black will be unable to defend d5, so the reply is forced.  now the knight jumps to the other side, threatening the advance of the c­pawn. one move earlier, this would have been ineffective because of the reply in the game, but the changed central pawn structure makes all the difference. once again, this is clearly forced. this is the real point of white's play, but he had to see a considerable distance to be able to play this. black is being led down a narrow path of only moves. if 30. ... axb4? then 31. e7 kxe7 32. c7 wins. this is the first stage of white's grand conception, but in order for it to work, he had to realize that this pawn ending, at first sight highly unfavourable, is in fact winning. black threatens to help himself to the e6-pawn, when it is he who would be winning, but white has another breakthrough. now, at last, we begin to see the whole of pillsbury's idea. his two central passed pawns are secure, and his king can cope with the enemy pawns. it is a rare case of a king and pawn ending in which central passed pawns prove stronger than outside ones. black has to try to make something of his queen side pawns, else white will simply take on e4 and then bring his king over to mop up the queen side. desperation, but he is lost anyway. after the more natural 36. ... ke7 play continues 37. kc4 b3 38. axb3 a3 39. kc3 f5 (the only remaining try, setting up a passed pawn on the kingside, but white's pawns are faster) 40. gxf5 h5 41. b4 g4 42. b5 h4 43.b6 g3 44 d6+! and white will queen first with check. threatening 38 ... b3. a justly famous "white knuckle ride" by pillsbury, who had to have calculated virtually the whole of the above sequence before entering the knight and pawn ending. perish the thought that anyone should think that endings are boring, but if there really is someone who does think so, he should be converted by this example.  
-------------------------------------
this ending is one of the most technically fascinating in chess, although it occurs rarely in practice. as is well known, two knights cannot force mate against a bare king, because at the crucial moment the defender's king will be stalemated. however, if the defender has a pawn, the stalemate does not arise, so it is possible to force mate. almost all of the research on this endgame was carried out by the legendary russian analyst and study composer, alexey troitzky, in the early years of the 20th century. troitzky's achievement is remarkable, as he analysed the endgame single-handedly, with no prior published theory or practice on which to build, and, of course, no computer help. he identified the basic plan, the techniques for corralling the defender's king, and he even worked out precisely where the defender's pawn needs to be, on each file, in order for the position to be a win. a few later analysts tidied up some loose ends, but almost all of the credit for solving this ending goes to troitzky. the biggest compliment to the quality of his work came in 1995, when john nunn published secrets of minor piece endings. this was part of a series of books in which nunn updated and corrected established endgame theory for new discoveries thrown up by the early this ending is one of the most tech-generations of computer endgame tablebases. when it came to two knights versus pawn, nunn decided to omit this ending from his book, "after discovering that the pre-database work of troitzky and other analysts was astonishingly accurate". effectively, the tablebase added nothing of real significance to the earlier analysis! the basic technique for winning the endgame is always the same, and consists of three stages: 1. the stronger side blockades the enemy pawn with one of his knights. 2. he then drives the defender's king into a corner, using his own king and the other knight. 3. having cornered the king in the corner, he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate. obviously, when he commences stage 3, he has to release the blockade on the pawn, which will then advance. it is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate, and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case. for various reasons, the line behind which the pawn must stand is not uniform, and it varies depending on which file the pawn stands. troitzky identified the full line, which is as follows (the diagram assumes that white is the stronger side and that we therefore have a black pawn):  despite troitzky's analysis, the end­ing is extremely complicated and far from easy to handle well, even for top grandmasters. in practice, when this ending arises, it tends to be drawn rather more often than it is won. a few years after the present game, for ex­ample, the leading grandmaster andor lilienthal reached the endgame, but was unable to win it (see norman­lilienthal, hastings 1934-5). he obviously did no the main alternative defence was to flee towards the a8 corner with  66. ka5 although the tablebase shows that this is actually the weakest defence, and shortens the winning process by several moves. black would con­tinue 66 ... kc5 67. ka6 nd7! 68. ka5 nb6! 69. ka6 nc4! 70. kb7 kd6 etc. the pattern shown over these last few moves is worth remembering, as it is a very typical one for this ending. it oc­curs again, much later, in the present game, but with the white king on the back rank-see moves 83-8s below. the knight on fs can never move until stage three is reached, else white will just push his pawn (black can never afford to capture it, of course), so the job of corralling the white king has to be done by the black king and the other knight.  we can already see that white's king is gradually pushed back. one factor which makes this position slightly easier than some is that the blockading knight is quite centrally placed, and thus helps to control some squares, such as d4 and e3. with a rook's pawn, the blockading knight is further from the centre and exerts less influence, which complicates the job of driving the defender's king into the corner.  this is a good illustration of the last note. the two knights create an impenetrable barrier on the kingside, preventing the white king from fleeing. this is one of seitz's few inaccura­cies in this whole endgame. the table­base shows that 74 ... kd3 would mate five moves more quickly, but this is of little practical significance since black has plenty of moves to spare in the 50 move allowance. this is an interesting formation. as a general rule of thumb, two knights are less effectively placed when they defend each other, and are more effective on adjacent squares, creating a barrier, such as seen at move 72. however, here we see an exception -the two knights control g2, g3, g4 and h4, thus still con­fining the white king in the comer. now the knight heads to c3, to cut the white king off from d1. the encircling is almost complete. if now 80 kg2 then 80 ... ke3 81. kh3 kf3  this is another typical formation. the knight on f2 stops the king going to d1, and after the forced reply ..  ... the knight moves to take away e1: if instead 87. kh2 kf3 88. kg1 nd3 89. kf1  and now it is already time for stage 3: 89. ... ne3+ 90. kg1 kg3 91. f5 ne5 92. f6 nf3+ 93. kh1 nd1 and mate next move.... now the king is finally trapped in the comer, and it is time for the final stage, administering mate... a splendid effort by seitz, who scarcely put a foot wrong. it is interesting that two of the best technical displays in this book (the present game and torre-jakobsen, game 16) should have come from players who did not even hold the grandmaster title. this shows that excellence in the endgame can be achieved by assiduous study. 
-------------------------------------
main annotations taken from steve giddins excellent 'greatest ever chess endgames' this position looks extremely equal,  but in fact, white has a small plus: he can attack the cs-pawn in short order  and assume some initiative as a result. this should result in his pieces being a little more active than black's. even so,  it is desperately hard to imagine white winning the position, against a worldclass opponent, and without the aid of a crude mistake from the defender. an extremely subtle move, which  would not enter many players' heads. karpov intends l:!bs, but at the moment, this runs into ... i.a6. the rook moves to free fl, so that white can play 'itf1, to defend the  bishop on e2. the question then i s where should the rook move to? most players would choose the open file, but karpov understands that black may start counterplay by attacking the c3-pawn with ... tt:la4 or ... tt:lds, so he overprotects the pawn, in anticipation. 18 ... i.c6 would have prevented white's next, but then 19 tt:les is unpleasant, when the knight can attack the cs-pawn from d3. now we see another reason why karpov put his rook on cl - after 19 ... i.xa2? 20 c4! the enemy bishop is lost! white has achieved his first aim. his rook is now very active on as, attacking both of black's isolated pawns, and tying his pieces down to defence. the manner in which karpov coordinates his pieces is beyond all praise. the knight heads for d3, from  where it attacks 􀃲weakness on c5 and at the same time 􀃱ents the black rook taking up an active post in the white position, on b2 or (as we will see) b4. this is the true meaning of prophylaxis - it is about more than simply taking defensive measures against the enemy's threats, and instead involves finding ways to improve one's  own position,  whilst at the same time defeating the enemy's plans. another prophylactic manoeuvre. karpov anticipates the threat of 23 ... l:ta4, exchanging off white's active rook now nothing can stop the temporarily active black rook from being driven back by lt:ld3.  24 lt:ld3 lk7 indirectly defends the c5-pawn for the moment, because of the tactic 25 lt:lxc5?? lt:lxc5 26 .l:i.xc5 .i.xg2+. karpov calmly eliminates this possibility, whilst at the same time limiting the scope of the enemy bishop and freeing his own king from the defence of g2. the c5-pawn is not going anywhere. if he tries to defend the c-pawn with  24 ... .l:.c7 2 5 lt:ld3 .i.b7, then 26 .i.a4 wins it anyway. black seeks counterplay, by preparing ... g5-g4, to attack white's kingside structure and open the g-file.  another very typical karpov move. if  he takes the pawn at once, then after 26 lt:lxc5 lt:lxc5 27 .l:!.xc5 black has the  remarkable resource 27. ..if. b2! ? 28 .l:!.xc6 :dd2 with surprisingly strong counterplay, despite the piece deficit. rather 1than allow his opponent to fish in such murky waters, karpov calmly seals up the b-file, before helping himself to the first fruits of his superb play. finally, white has won the c5-pawn, without allowing any active counterplay.  the next stage is to  onsolidate and start on the process of converting his advantage. exchanging pieces is generally a  good idea when material up, especially when there is still plenty of material on the board. black continues to seek active counterplay on the kingside. karpov immediately tries to take  advantage of the weakening of the enemy kingside pawns. this move involves exchanging two pairs of pawns, which in principle is not necessarily to the stronger side's advantage. it also  gives black a passed pawn on the e-file, which may be a source of counterplay. on the other hand, at the end of the process, the black h-pawn will be vulnerable. panchenko suggests that white  should fix the h s-pawn with 37 h4 but karpov was presumably reluctant to give the enemy bishop a secure post on g4. the game way adjourned around  this point, an􀃰the remaining moves were influenced by overnight analysis. the passed pawn can be blockaded  securely enough after 42 ... e4 43 􀅂dl. instead, kasparov transfers his rook to the f-file, to invade via f2 or fl. one might have expected karpov to go after the h-pawn, so as to eliminate the counterplay this pawn might offer. indeed, after 43 .l:.h4 .l:lf8 44 .l:.xh3 l:tf3+ 45 <i;;b2 it is not obvious how black can exploit the temporary misplacing of  white's rook. however, white's pieces have lost coordination, and his king is cut off, and karpov's adjournment analysis had presumably convinced him that an easier win was to be had by reating another passed pawn of his own on the queenside, and playing actively. now we can see the difference from the variation given in the last note. here, all of white's pieces are xcellently coordinated, supporting the passed c-pawn. the path of the c-pawn has been  cleared of obstacles, and the end is now not far away. 50 ... h2 loses to 51 c7 hl'i¥ 52 .i.c6+. threatening 5 2 ... h2,since the square h7 is no longer available to white's rook.  now the bishop takes over the task of covering the h-pawn, and the only way to close its diagonal is to put a black unit on e4, which will give the white rook the h7-square again. accuracy to the very end. after karpov's phenomenal play, it would have been an absolute tragedy to have fallen into the trap 54 􀀺b7 l:th8 55 c8'ii'?? l:.xc8 56 􀀺xc8 i..f5 when black draws, e.g. 57 i..h 1 e4! 58 a4 wf2 59 i..xe4 i..xe4 60 .l:td2+ 􀀺xg3 61 !:txh2 􀀺xh2. 56 􀀺b7 .i.e6 continues the resistance. if 56 ... wf2 then simply 57 .l:!.xe5. a really fantastic display by karpov. it is hard to pinpoint any obvious mistake by black, yet it is impossible to believe that the starting position was really lost for him. 
-------------------------------------
(notes by gm ray keene.) kramnik, the defending world champion, scored a brilliant victory in the 14th and final game; peter leko resigned after 41 moves when faced with checkmate. this is only the third time in the entire history of the world championship that the defending champion has saved his title by winning in the final game. the game itself was a jewel of controlled aggression. despite consistent exchanges throughout the game, kramnik maintained an iron grip on the position and ultimately blasted his way into the black camp via the dark squares. taking no account of material sacrifices it was kramnik’s king that dealt the fatal blow when it marched right into the heart of the opposing position. this outstanding game, the best of the match, recalled the classic fifth game won by petrosian against botvinnik in 1963 when a similarly epic king march in an endgame brought white a classic victory. "i had to give everything, especially at the end, to win against such an opponent. peter leko is an incredible defender. for me it was more difficult than my match against kasparov in the year 2000", said kramnik after the game. leko said in conclusion: "it was a very hard fight. in the end, it was not enough for me to win the title. i'm disappointed, but i'm looking forward to the future. i'm 25 years old, and i hope to get a new chance to become world champion."   <additional annotation by steve giddins>  leko is not averse to repeating the main lines of the caro-kann.  by contrast, kramnik must seek sharper paths. this move, favoured by nimzowitsch, tal and short, is ideal for a must-win situation, since it locks pawn formations and avoids premature exchanges.  nimzowitsch liked this 3 e5 variation and would play here 4 bd3. his most famous game with this line is sadly a loss, a magnificent manoeuvring game against capablanca from new york 1927. the most common alternative these days is 4 nc3, as played for example by kasparov in a drastic win over karpov at linares 2001, which continued 4...e6 5 g4 bg6 6 nge2 ne7 7 nf4 c5 8 dxc5 nd7 9 h4 nxe5 10 bg2 h5 11 qe2 n7c6 12 nxg6 nxg6 13 bg5 be7 14 gxh5 nf8 15 nb5 nd7 16 h6. the latest try for black is 4 nc3 a5!? as in sebag-chiburdanidze, fide wch women ko, elista 2004. black won in 33 moves after 5 be3 a4 6 a3 qb6 7 rb1 qa5 8 g4 bd7 9 bg2 e6 10 nge2 c5 11 0–0 nc6 12 f4 h5. this 4 h4 line was tested repeatedly in the tal-botvinnik wcc match, moscow 1961, with generally favourable results for black. the paths they followed are retraced below.  4...h5 may be preferable, after which tal tried 5 ne2 e6 6 ng3 g6 7 nxf5 gxf5 8 c4 c5 9 cxd5 qxd5 but only drew their 14th game from 1961.  instead 5 ne2 is possible and in their 20 th game 5 e6 6 ng3 ne7 7 nc3 nd7 8 be3 bh7 9 bd3 bxd3 10 cxd3 h5 led to a marathon struggle and another draw.  it looks more natural to retreat the bishop along the b1-h7 diagonal, but, in that case, black has to reckon with the dangerous pawn sac e5-e6.  this looks like a new move. in the 10th tal-botvinnik game from 1961, we saw 6 h5 c5 7 c3 nc6 8 bh3 e6 9 be3 qb6 10 qb3 cxd4 11 qxb6 axb6 12 cxd4 na5 and black won in 42; while the 18 th game followed the course 6 c3 c5 7 bg2 e6 8 ne2 bb5 9 na3 bxe2 10 qxe2 cxd4 11 cxd4 bxa3 12 bxa3 nc6 and black won again. however, tal persisted with this line, and in tal-pachman, bled 1961, he finally won after launching an attack following 7... e6 8 f4 qb6 9 nf3 nc6 10 na3 cxd4 11 cxd4 o-o-o 12 nc2 kb8 13 bd3 nge7 14 rb1 na5 15 bd2 rc8 16 b4.  black has one way to free himself before white's pawns begin to exert a fatal grip.  a small combination that regains his pawn, but at the cost of trading his dark squared bishop. 9...qc7 would doubtless transpose, but this is more forcing.  the tone of play for the middlegame is set -- black's position is resilient, but white has a promising future on the central dark squares. fritz now wanted to try the line-opening gambit 14...d4!?, but no human player would yet regard such drastic measures as necessary. (it's a mark of how far computer programs have advanced that fritz makes this dynamic choice.)  accepting some exchanges, but white's dark square grip persists. in contrast, 15 bxg6 gives black too much counterplay along the half-open f-file.  <giddins>this game is something of a parallel to botvinnik-bronstein (game 23). here, too, the world championship was at stake, in the decisive game of the match. this was the 14th and last game (barely over half the number played in 1951!), and kramnik trailed by a point, so he too needed to win this game to save his world championship title. white has a small, but definite advantage, thanks to more space and the better bishop. however, the black position  is very solid and has no real weaknesses, so it will not be easy to break him down. from now on, white's play is direct and brutal. i would have played bf1 and followed it with ke3. kramnik has no truck with such sophisticated nuances and goes directly for the jugular.  <giddins>18. bf1 is perhaps the reflex move,but kramnik did not like the reply 18 ...h5. besides, he saw no reason to fear the exchange on d3 - it leaves white with the traditional knight versus bad bishop. and here i would have left black's king's-side pawns severely alone and traded on d3. after 18...nxd3 19 kxd3 ke7 20 rc7 rab8 followed by ...rhc8, i believe black could withstand the onslaught from white, though it must be admitted that white's knight will always be superior to black's bishop.  19 g5 is possible instead, but kramnik is all for open lines.  <giddins>there is no value in blocking up the kingside with 19. g5. kramnik's move activates the rook on the potentially open g-file. <giddins>19 ...nh3 20. rg3 nxf2 is met by 21 gxh5 when black can hardly defend the g-pawn. <giddins>structurally, white has acquired a weakness on the h-file, but on the other hand, the opening of lines on the kingside gives more dynamism to the position. an admirable display of energy, but, after 22...bxa4 23 rc7 bb5 24 rxb7 o-o, black reduces the tension and gains counterplay. taking the pawn could even be dangerous for white after 25 bxb5 axb5 26 rxb5 ra2+. for this reason, i prefer 22 ke3 restricting black's knight, and if 22...o-o then 23 rg5 g6 24 rcg1 ng7 25 h5! or if 24...kh8 25 bxg6! fxg6 26 rxg6 rf7 27 ng5 and wins.  <giddins>white starts selzlng space on the other wing, classic two-front strategy. ? leko exhibits an alarming tendency towards a bunker mentality. after this passive move, black is strangled in the style of his hero petrosian or of nimzowitsch, the arch-blockader and early prophet of 3 e5 against the caro-kann.  <giddins>annotating the game in new in chess 2004/8, kramnik suggested that this natural move may in fact be the decisive mistake. 22 ...bxa4 23. rc7 is obviously bad, but kramnik recommended 22 ...ke7! 23. b5 axb5 24. axb5 bd7 25. rc7 b6 when he could find no direct win. black intends to challenge the rook with ....rhc8, and 26. rb7 is nothing after 26 ..rhb8. it is strange that allowing the rook into c7 should prove to be better than keeping it out, but it appears that this may be the case. this is the difference. the f7-square is now vulnerable. the point of white's play is to answer 24. ...axb5 with 25. bxb5!. as we discussed in the context of petrosianbannik,  bad bishops are often effective defenders of weaknesses, and the key to success frequently involves exchanging off the bad bishop, so as to expose the weaknesses. that is the case here. once the bishop on e8 is removed, black finds it harder to cover f7 satisfactorily. kramnik gives, as a sample variation, the line 25 ...rf8 26. bxe8 kxe8 27. rc7 rxa4 28. rb1 rxd4+ 29. ke3 kc4 30. rcxb7 rc3+ 31. kd2 rc8 32. ra7 and white will double rooks on the seventh, with a mating attack. note how in this line black is so badly tied down to the defence of f7 once his bishop is gone. clearing the a-file merely offers white a further avenue of attack after 24...axb5 25 axb5 ra3 26 ra1!  creating a terrible outpost on c7 for his rook. black must prevent such an invasion at all costs.  <giddins>now there is no way to prevent a rook invasion at c7, and black's position is objectively lost. black eliminates one enemy rook, but the other will replace it. black has plugged one path for white's forces but more soon open. black, we soon see, is fatally debilitated on the central dark square complex.  30 ...kd7 allows the tactic 31. nxb7 after which the white b-pawn will prove unstoppable. passive defence is hopeless, so black tries to clear off as many white pawns as he can.   <giddins>passive defence by 31. ...rh7 will inevitably lose, e.g. 32. a5 ke7 33. rg6 and white can prepare a breakthrough with f4-f5 at his leisure. kramnik pointed out that i f black starts checking, the white king can march into the heart of black's position, via f4-g5-f6 etc. !! the decisive coup. white's small but highly efficient army is ready to concentrate its powers and deal the death blow. if now 34...rxd4, then 35 f5 exf5 36 e6 re4+ 37 nxe4 fxe4 38 rc7, threatening rxc6, and if 37...bb5+, 38 ke3 when black's b-pawn is doomed and white's king penetrates.  34 ...rxd4 35 f5 exf5 36. e6 threatens mate in one. 36 ...ra1 leads to a lost rook and pawn endgame after 37. nxb7+ bxb7 38. rxb7 rg1+ 39. kh5. the same theme. the way white's king now takes the black fortress by storm with just rook and knight against rook and bishop reminds me strongly of the epic king march and superlative conclusion of game 5 from the petrosian-botvinnik wcc match, moscow 1963.  black resigns since 41...ke8 42 rc8+ kd7 43 rd8 is 'mate. a jewel of a game and a sublime atonement for the sins of omission in some previous games of this match. now compare the celebrated king march by petrosian that doubtless provided inspiration for kramnik as he conducted his final onslaught.   <giddins>a fine technical squeeze by kramnik, played in conditions of enormous tension. 
-------------------------------------
this is a particularly interesting position. black has an extra pawn, but since it is the backward pawn on h7, it does not look all that valuable, as it seems unlikely to produce a passed pawn. meanwhile, the white king is quite active in the centre, and he has a pawn endings passed pawn on d5 to set against black's passed c5-pawn. however, despite these first impressions, the h­pawn in fact turns out to be vital after all. there are two reasons. one is that it provides a reserve tempo with ... h7-h6, which can play a vital role in a king dance for the opposition. secondly, there is also the potential tactical breakthrough ... h5, should the black king be located within the square of the resulting white passed pawn after the reply gxh5. these factors prove sufficient to win the game for black, but only thanks to some extremely nifty footwork by his king. this is the only move to win, since after 45 ... kb6 46 kc4 a5 47 a4   black would be forced to expend his precious reserve tempo with 47 ... h6.  as will be­come clear later, the resulting position would only be a draw.  now we have the same position as in the previous note, but with white to move -a crucial difference. keres shows that white has no al­ternative to this exchange of passed pawns, since after 48. kc3 kc7 49. kc4 kd6 50. kb5 kxd5 51. kxa5 ..  black wins with the neat 51 ... kc6! imprisoning the white king in front of his a-pawn. a vital moment. the move 51 kb5 is is not possible, because after 51 ... h5! 52 gxh5 g4 the g-pawn promotes,whilst the white h-pawn is stopped by black's king (see the introductory remarks). this is the key point of the whole ending, and shows that black's extra h­-pawn is not the irrelevance it may have first seemed. the threat of ... h7-h5 means that the white king is effectively held in an invisible prison, bounded by the square of the g5-pawn, and cannot go left of the c-file or further forward than c5. now 52 ... hs is again a threat, this time with a quieter follow-up, e.g. 52 kd4 h5! 53 gxh5 kg7! (with the idea of simply ... kh6 and ... kxh5) 54. kd5 g4! 55. ke4 kh6 56. kf4 kxh5  winning easily. now 52. ... h5? 53. gxh5 kg7 is not possible because of 54. kf3 kh6 55. kg4 and the white king is in time to defend the hs-pawn. the point of the text is that white is in zugzwang. his king has to stay on the e-file, to be able to meet the threat of 53. ... h5 54. gxh5 kg7 the only move, but now we see that this too has its drawbacks. the black king changes direction and heads back to the centre. white must come to meet him and take the opposition, but, crucially, black still has his reserve tempo in his pocket.  and here it is. black takes the oppo­sition and the white king must give way.  going the other way also loses, once again because of the strike by the h­pawn: 56. kc4 ke5 57. kb5 h5! now the white king is out­side the square of the g5-pawn! 58. gxh5 kxf5 59. kxa5 g4 60. kb5 g3 61. a5 g2 62. a6 g1 queens and wins.  57 ... kb4 also wins, but allows unnecessary counter-play after 58. kd4 kxa4 59. kd5 kb3 60. ke6 etc. keres' move maintains black's dominance and wins without any alarums. fittingly enough, it is the h-pawn which administers the coup de grace.  as keres points out, this is again simpler than 61 ... g4+ 62. kg3 kg5 63. h6  although black is still winning after 63 ..kxh6 64. kxg4 kg6 65. kf4 f5  a highly instructive endgame, showing several important themes. 
-------------------------------------
relatively little was known about this type of endgame at the time this game was played, and despite a few inaccuracies in the play, botvinnik first whole endgame has now been "tablebased", it is not always a simple matter to divine the underlying point behind many of the computer's moves. broadly, we can point out the following rules of thumb: 1. one of white's main weapons in such endings is the "cross-check", i.e . answering a check by  interposing his queen, so as himself to give check, and so force an exchange of queens. this idea lies behind several of the other principles of such endings.  2. whilst there are no hard and fast rules as to which positions are won and which are not, it is true to say that the stronger side generally has most winning chances with a centre pawn or bishop's pawn, fewer chances with a knight's pawn, and fewest of all with a rook's pawn. the tablebase confirms that the present position should be a draw with best play.  3. the stronger side's queen usually takes up a post in the centre of the board, where its influence is at its greatest, and the chance of crosschecks is maximized. 4. the stronger side should usually try to place his own king on the same or adjacent rank or file as the enemy  king. this maximizes the chance of cross-checks.  5. with a knight's pawn as here, the defender's king should generally head for the corner diagonally opposite to the pawn's queening square (in other words, the a1-corner in this position). this, too, is motivated by the defender's desire to reduce the chances of cross-checks.  armed with these basic principles, we will see how botvinnik handled the ending. it should be noted that he had the benefit of adjournment analysis, of course; and since this was an olympiad, it can be assumed that his teammates will have contributed. in my opinion, none of this diminishes the value of botvinnik's achievement in this game.  it should be noted that white cannot be prevented from advancing his pawn at least as far as the sixth rank in such positions. this does not mean that the position is lost or that the defender has erred. the real  technical problems for white starts once his pawn gets to the sixth rank. this is a typical example of the application of the principles enunciated above, especially principles (3) and (4). thanks to the position of his king and queen, white is in a position to meet checks such as 59 ...qd3+?? with the cross-check 60. qf5+. thus far, the tablebase confirms that black has defended well enough to keep the position within drawing bounds, but his last move is an inaccuracy, after which the position is a win for white, albeit in 65 moves. black has five possible drawing moves here, but the most logical of these, following principle (5) above, is 60 ... ka4. heading the black king towards the safety zone in the south-west corner. an inaccuracy in turn. the ruthless tablebase shows that white has only one move to win here, and that is the  rather illogical 61 kh7, which goes against the principle that the white king should seek a position o in the same or the adjacent file as its opposite number. however, i do not think either player can be reproached for such minor imprecisions, given the huge complexity of such endings. all any human player can hope for is to understand the basic principles and apply them as far as possible; the tactical features of these positions are so great that they are always going to be beyond a human player's capacity. another imprecision, after which the assessment swings over to "winning" once again. of black's three drawing moves, two involve following principle (5) above and heading his king towards the safe corner: 6. ...ka3 or 63 ...kb3. white finds the most accurate move, underlining the drawback of black's last. now his king is forced away from the safe corner, because 64 ..ka3? runs into the cross-check 65. qf3+ there is nothing wrong with the immediate 65 g6 (indeed, it even wins two moves quicker), but botvinnik's move is more logical from the human viewpoint - he first puts his queen on a more centralized square, in accordance with principle (3). once again, the proximity of the opposing kings means that crosschecks are in the air, both after 67 ...qd2+? 68. qf4+, and 67. ...qg1+ 68. kf5! when there are no safe checks. 68. kf5 qc8+ 69. kf4 qcl+ 70. qe3 qc7+ 71. qe5.  in itself, this move does not spoil anything, but it is the start of a short phase during which botvinnik loses his way. he should prefer 71. kg4 or 71. kg5. we have actually reached the same position as after black's 67th move. the first time round, botvinnik found the  most accurate move, 74 kf5. it should also be noted that the plan of placing the white king in front of his pawn with 74. kh6? qh4+ 75. kg7 is much weaker. this was a lesson that botvinnik had been forced to learn the hard way, as he had made exactly that mistake in the same ending, against the soviet master ravin sky, eight years earlier. the tablebase confirms that the ending is then a draw. now there are no more profitable checks, since after 76. ...qh8+ 77. kg4, black once again suffers from his king  being on the same rank as its opposite number. one can see how much easier his defensive task would be if his king were now on a2 or a1, as it could have been, had he taken his chances earlier in the endgame. however, even though he is out of checks, black is not yet completely out of ammunition. instead, minev resorts to another typical defensive technique in such queen endings - pinning the pawn. a fundamental error of principle, which again endangers the win. this move simply drives the black king closer towards the safe comer, and the tablebase confirms that the position should be drawn after this. instead, white can win with several continuations, the main one being 77. kg4. however, the difficulty of such endings is attested to by the fact that the win still takes 60 moves from this position! (however, this does not mean it is a draw - white will, of course, advance his g-pawn again inside the so moves allowance). returning the favour. it is clear that minev did not understand the point about where his king was best placed, a forgivable error for his time, but one which makes botvinnik's task easier. obviously, the black king should emulate the birds and gratefully migrate to the kinder climate of the south, with 77 ...ka3! . botvinnik follows principle (3), and takes the chance to centralize his queen with gain of tempo. in so doing, he maximizes its influence, and so reduces the enemy queen's scope for checks. now we see the effect of botvinnik's  piece positioning. black soon runs out of checks, whilst the superbly placed white queen also controls the next square of the pawn, g7. once again, the possibility of a cross-check means that black is out of checks, and this time he cannot prevent the pawn advancing further. once again, the tablebase shows that the immediate 83 g7 wins slightly more quickly, but the human instinct is to improve the queen position first. another characteristic idea for such endings. with the pawn only one square from queening, the white king approaches closer towards its opposite number, to seek the elusive crosscheck. curiously, mark dvoretsky gives the note "87. kd5?! qc8!, but the tablebase shows that this wins for white in exactly the same number of moves as the text. 88 ...qh6+ 89 kd5 is again the end  of the checks. the final position deserves a diagram, as it perfectly illustrates the elements of the winning method. the white que􀘖n occupies a dominating central square, also controlling the queening square of the pawn, the two kings stand close together, and all the possible checks are defeated by a crosscheck. despite a number of inaccuracies, this is a classic endgame, and immensely instructive. without the aid of either tablebases or any substantial heoretical practice, apart from his own game against ravinsky years before, botvinnik effectively "solved" this ending in his adjournment analysis, identifying all the key elements of the winning method in such positions.

this is the textbook demonstration of how to exploit an extra, outside passed pawn in a rook ending, with the stronger side's rook behind the passed pawn. if the white rook were on a6 and the black rook on a4, the game would be a draw, although it is not as easy to defend as once thought, as mentioned in the next example, but as it is, white is winning by force. the ending is also of great historical significance, because this was game 34 of the alekhinecapablanca world championship match. alekhine led 5-3 in decisive games, needing six wins to take the world title, so this was the endgame which dethroned the great "invincible" cuban and gave the chess world its fourth world champion. the vital first step. the rook takes up position behind its passed pawn. now the black rook is tied to a6, else the white pawn will advance, whilst the white rook can make tempo moves back down the a-file, as required. white's plan is as follows:  1. bring his king over towards the pawn. the black king will have to stand in opposition, to prevent the white king reaching b5 and forcing the advance of the pawn. 2. once the kings stand in opposition, a waiting move by the white rook will force the black king to give way; either it allows its opposite number into b5, or into the kingside (two weaknesses!}. i have always thought it curious that, although this ending has been examined in almost every major endgame textbook, this move has hardly ever been commented upon. yet it is open to the objection that it weakens the square g5 and so allows the white king an avenue via this square into black's kingside pawns, as indeed occurs later in the game. it therefore seems logical to suggest 56. ...kd5, keeping the pawn on h6.   by a curious coincidence, just as this book was being written, german endgame expert dr karsten muller devoted one of his chess cafe endgame columns to an examination of this very move, prompted by  analysis supplied by a german amateur, erich korber. the full analysis is too extensive to reproduce here, and can be found in muller's column anyway, but the conclusion is that white still wins. the main line of the analysis immediately exploits black's failure to play 56 ...h5, as follows: 57. h5 ke6 (or 57. ...g5 58. f4 gxf4+ 59. kxf4 and white's king invades the kingside, rather as in the final phase of the game continuation) 58. hxg6 fxg6 and white will now be able to create another passed pawn, this time on the  king side.  just as in the game, black will not be able to hold both fronts: 59. f4 h5 60. kd4 kd6 61. ra3! and white wins in similar fashion to the game: his king will either penetrate on the queenside and support the apawn, or will attack the kingside pawns, supported at the crucial moment by a switch of his rook. readers wishing to see the complete analysis should visit www.chesscafe.com, and look up the karsten muller article "news on a classical rook endgame", dated 19 october 2011. step one has been accomplished. step 2. black's king must give way. 59 ... 'it>ds? 60 􀁦b4 obviously loses much more quickly. before advancing his king, white repeats moves. continuing the next stage of the plan. now the white king will mount a raid on the black kingside pawns,  and seek to establish a decisive material advantage on that side of the board. as usual, black cannot take the a-pawn, because the resulting king and pawn ending would be hopeless, so his only defensive idea is to "change the guard" on the queenside; the king will occupy a6, blocking the passed pawn, and the black rook will endeavour to hold off the white king. for the time being, black has achieved his best possible defensive formation. his king holds up the passed pawn, whilst his rook defends the kingside pawns. however, as so often, zugzwang will prove to be the straw that breaks the camel's back "do not hurry!" alekhine is here guilty of breaking that cardinal rule, and although it does not imperil the win, it does make it harder. i am sure a rubinstein or an ulf andersson would have played the precise zugzwang finish 67. kg7! rf3 68. kf8! rf5 69. kg8! triangulation. 69. ...rf3 (or 69. ...rf6 70. f4 rf5 71. kg7) 70. kg7! rf5 71. f4 and black must lose a pawn. seizing his chance to re-position the rook onto the second rank, where he has enough squares to avoid zugzwang. 68 ...rc3 was a threat. now we can see that white has complicated things. his rook has lost much of its mobility, because of the need to defend g3, whilst the black rook has plenty of squares on the second rank and cannot be driven into zugzwang. fortunately, white still has another way of breaking the enemy resistance - undermining his kingside pawn structure with a pawn break. this is the key idea. black must capture, after which the h-pawn falls and his remaining kingside pawns are weak. 71. ...rd5 was another defensive try, but then 72. kg5! (72 kxh5? f4+) 72. ...rc5 73. kf6 rd5 74. kxf7 f4 (passive play also loses, e.g. 74. ...rc5 75. kf6 rd5 76. rf3! etc.) 75. gxf4 rf5+ 76. kg6 rxf4 77. kxh5 and wins. clearly, the only hope. the decisive switch to the kingside. the a-pawn will fall, but the black king is too far away to avoid  devastation on the opposite flank. 7s ...kxa5? 76. re5+ is immediately decisive. black could still pose practical problems by 76 ...kb7 77. re7+ ka6 78. re5 rxf4 79. kxh5 f6, although the tablebase confirms that white is winning with the transfer of his rook to the hfile by 80. re3 ka5 81. rh3 etc. of course, many endings with this material distribution are theoretically drawn, but not with the black king cut off so far away.

transponiendo a una línea conocida y principal (el ataque fegatello) con el tiempo de h3 incluido. ca5 sería una mejor respuesta. un sacrificio típico en esta variante. los primeros en emplearlo fueron polerio y greco a comienzos del siglo xvii. es un sacrificio en el mejor sentido de la palabra, pues no existe una victoria forzada. las blancas consiguen una compensación muy grande basada en el desarrollo y en la mala posición del rey negro. 13.d4 era lo correcto. era preciso jugar con energía. la jugada era ab7. dudoso. lo mejor parece ser 18.e6 abriendo líneas seguido del jaque con af4. luego de este error la partida está decidida. era necesario 18...de6 bloqueando al peón de rey y salvando la dama. y las blancas ganaron unas jugadas más tarde. 
-------------------------------------
per adesso, solo uno studio interessante per un neofita in teoria di aperture. c'� il dubbio se "funzionerebbe" o no un certo sacrificio in e6, sull'arrocco nero. questa era la posizione desiderata dalle bianche con b4.  a partire da questa mossa, diventa complicatissimo valutare in ogni mossa successiva l'opportunit� di axe6, f7xe6, cxe6, axe6 (obbligata per la doppietta torre-donna), dxe6 , seguita da axe6. la domanda �: c'� sufficiente compensazione per il pezzo sacrificato? sembrerebbe di s�, ma chi � pi� bravo me lo dica... dopo molti ripensamenti.  scartando il scarificio per ora, l'idea � fare pressione su d6, quasi obbligando la torre ad andare in d8.  poi, c'� da pensare (per vedere se funziona, in alternativa ad un'altra mossa, pi� "tranquilla", come l'arrocco), a d4-d5, e se ce5, vedere se "funziona": d5xe6, e se cxac5, e6xf7 , rh8 o rf8 (se rf8 c'� da considerare cxcf6, axc, cxh7 , rg7, cxa, axc, o-o ma... non so se � sufficiente). in entrambi i casi non � chiaro il vantaggio delle bianche. ma poi mi sono accorto che se a d5 il nero risponde con e6xd5, cxf6 , axf6 rimetteva in gioco l'opportunit� di cxe6... ma nessuno mi obbliga a spingere il pedone in d5! e come potrebbe continuare l'attacco? alla prossima, h6 mi obbliga di nuovo a scegliere se sacrificare il cavallo in e6 o rassegnarmi a cxf6 , axf6, ce4, ae7, con posizione direi uguale, dato che la pressione su d6 non pu� aumentare.   e se il nero fa e5? un'altro mondo...  alla fine, per�, ho rischiato per cd2-e4, mi piaceva troppo l'idea di far pressione e portare avanti i miei pezzi.   l'alternativa era cg5-e4! in questo modo, rimaneva difeso l'alfiere c5 dopo un eventuale ce5 del nero, anche se per� rinunciavo alla difesa (e/o attacco del cavallo, secondo le varianti) di f7...  e come sempre, come achille, ho scelto la pi� rischiosa... eccomi ad una delle posizioni previste... quella il cui commento era: "come continuare l'attacco?". e ho cercato un bel po'.  f2-f4 sembra un errore per d6-d5, poi l'unica che ha senso � f4-f5, e se d5xac4, axdc7, c4xc3, c7xtd8 , cxd8, a3xa3 sembra essere molto vantaggiosa per il bianco, ma... posso fidarmi?  ce n'erano anche altre, come g2-g4!?, ma non mi � sembrato che la minaccia del pedone in g5 fosse sufficiente a contrarrestare la mossa "liberatrice" del nero e6-e5, al che ho pensato sia a d5 che a ad5, ma anche d4xe5... e qui le analisi sono molte e poco chiare per la mia limitata visione scacchistica... :-(  allora, ho scelto quella pi� prudente. non senza prima considerare anche o-o-o!?, pensando ad avanzare in massa i pedoni di re. ma anche questa era molto rischiosa, sempre per e6-e5.  devo risaltare che non ho dato abbastanza importanza a quell'asserto "e qui poi come continuo l'attacco?", e non ho evitato di trovarmici in mezzo...  mi ero detto che era un errore muovere il pedone per ca5, ma qui credevo che non ci fosse alcun problema.  non avevo "visto" questa. il calcolo era che non poteva mangiare il pedone perch� poi, con ta-d1, erano guai. e qui l'errore fatale, perch� mi sono perso in tante varianti. era tentatrice muovere il cavallo per poi dare lo scacco con doppietta in f6, ma in entrambi i "buchi" me lo mangiava e, anche se salvavo la donna, rimanevo con un pezzo netto in meno. qui la partita � persa. c'era qualche remota speranza spingendo il pedone, per�.  se raggiungo la settima, il nero deve giocare con attenzione.  
-------------------------------------
a mini-tournament game, playing a teammate of mine from the cynical cynics. open game. the caro-kann. yuck! the more i play against it, the more irritating i find it. it hobbles us gung-ho attackers. i think i'm going to start playing the anti-caro-kann from now on...  the advance variation. i find it comical that the description in wikipedia says "has gained popularity after having previously been widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the strategic demolition that aron nimzowitsch (playing as white) suffered at the hands of josé capablanca in one of their games at the new york 1927 tournament." but that happened over 80 years ago, and it's only just now gaining popularity? maybe that wiki article was written back in the 1930s? wiki recommends 4. ... e6 to shore up the center followed by 5. ... c5 to challenge the center. black instead opts to pin the white knight, losing a tempo by moving his bishop a second time. in return, white defends with the queen's knight, a move i got, no doubt, from the gk db, though i don't like it much myself. now white's queen's bishop is blocked. more to my taste would have been 5. bf4 followed by 6. nbd2. i don't see anything wrong with that move order, but the db doesn't favor it.  probably should have just played 5. be2 and been done with it, without trapping the queen's bishop. i guess i better get myself some good analysis of the caro-kann and find out why white is supposed to play all these moves that don't sit well with me, then figure out whether i should just learn to accept them because they're the best moves, or whether white has alternatives that are more my style. about time. this move has the advantage of challenging c5, though with black's knight on d7, it's not enough of a challenge. 8. bxf3 seems really strange to me. it's the 4th time in the first 8 moves that black moved that bishop, and he could have just played that on move 6 and been done with it, and saved a tempo in the process. i have no analysis of this opening to tell me whether black is following sound opening theory or not, but the move seems strange to me. now we've opened the c-file, and black seems better suited to seize it for himself. grrrrr. at least white has the lead in space and in development. black isn't really threatening much with his knight on f5. still, white finds no sound attacks so i make a subtle threat. or maybe not so subtle, but in this game, it worked well enough. this move works because the pawn on e6 is doing double duty. it cannot simultaneously defend the pawn on d5 and the knight on f5. black's pieces are getting in their own way - the knight on d7 block's his queen's defense of d5. there, now i think i might like this caro-kann a little better now that white is up a pawn and has isolated black's pawn on the d-file. ok, ok, i'm fairly sure we've left the main lines of the opening by now. threatening 17. bh6. not so much because i want the bishop on f4, but more because i want a rook on c1. hunting pawns. what a degrading thing for a queen, but game after game, she seems to like it. black's pieces keep getting in each other's way. f8 is not a happy square for a knight. black found a happier square for his knight, but he missed the fact that his f7 pawn was en prise. and now so is his happy knight. black offered the trade, and white's bishop was doing very littl eon e3, and white is up two pawns, so white is glad to accept. another favorable trade. thinking to double the rooks on the c-file, and fully expecting black to do something about his pawn on d5. black doubled his rooks on a file they can't really use, so even though it means giving black the open c-file, white seizes the chance to eliminate black's only center pawn, creating a pair of adjacent passed center pawns for white. even if i didn't know how this game ends, it would be a sure bet to assume that these two center pawns will win this game. chasing the knight back - it has no good squares except to return whence it came. black keeps leaving his pawns laying around, it would be rude not to clean them up. black defends his pawn, but it's not really a defense. now if 32. ... rxa4???, white wins instantly with 33. rb8+. time to win the game. white wants to play d6! but there are one too many attackers aimed at e6. time to chase one away. and now the winning move. final position. black had been counting on the pin to prevent 39. d7 but he resigned after playing 38. ... rxe6. in his resignation comment he noted that after 39. d7! rxb6, 40. d8=q+ forks black's king and rook and wins back the rook, leaving white ahead by queen and three pawns. black could try 39. ... re1+ 40. kh2 and now black has nothing to stop white's pawn promotion, and queen+knight vs. rook+knight will not end well for black, especially since white has three pawns to the good and can gladly trade his queen for the black rook if he wishes. 
-------------------------------------
hi everyone!  wolfgang (caveman1960) managed to get up into the low 2000s.  although his rating has fallen below it, after this game i still strongly back him to get back up there.  this game did last into the endgame, a b v n endgame and both our kings went on pawn gobbling missions.  but whose king got in first?  well, read on or read ga below.   2. d4 - pretty standard double qp opening following the reti. 3.c4 - which transposes into a queen's gambit declined. 5.e3 - opening up fou leblanc's diagonal. 7. be2 - clearing the decks for henry to go kingside. 9. bxc4 - pawn trade. 11. e4 - now opening up the diagonal for fou lenoir. 12. be2 - retreat. 14. rxd4 - another pawn trade. 18. rdd1 - after a knight trade another retreat. 19. be3 - and another. 21. ne2 - looking to put pressure on the c6 pawn. 23. rxd1 - rook trade. 24. ….. qxd8 - followed by another. 26. bf4 - trying to relieve pressure down the h2 to b8 diagonal. 28. nxf4 - bishop trade. 30. kf1 - escaping from a very nasty pin from the bq so that i can use the f3 pawn to back up the weak e4 pawn. 32. ……. b4 - mmmm, crafty, he does not recapture on c4 due to the fact that he can now pin my knight on e2.  nasty, nasty! 33. ke1 - henry now tries to assist his beloved wife, glenda in the defense of the queenside. 34. …… bxc4 - and after the queens have been traded off, my pawn on a2 is en prise.  but there is a way out of this mess. 35. nc1 - like this. 37. nd3 - either the g3 or the h3 white pawns is a gonner so i concentrate on liquidating wolfgang's queenside pawns. 39. kc3 - king fork!  yes, wolfgang's bishop can still back it up along the a2-g8 diagonal but my knight will attack it on the next turn and then the black b pawn will be eliminated. 42. kxb3 - the queenside pawns have been liquidated.  henry now has a dilemma - should he merely defend the white vulnerable kingside pawns or should henry counter-attack the black kingside pawns?  henry, after a long deliberation decides that attack is the best form of defense so he goes for the black kingside pawns. 45. kd6 - the heat is on. 46. bf1 - this looks to be a reasonable move, activate fou leblanc.  this move proves to be a mistake, according to ga.  i should have moved this prelate to h1 instead. 47. kd7 - at this stage wolfgang is really impressed by henry's move towards his pawns and told me he thought this was making the endgame very interesting.  nice. 48. ……. ne5 - henry is foiled. 49. ……. g5 - and foiled again! 50. ……. h5 - and again! 52. kxf7 - at last henry is able to capture something, but there are still 2 black pawns left on the board. 54. kh5 - henry desperately tries to make forg4 to block the g pawn.  sadly king wolfgang puts a stop to this. 56. ……. nh2! an excellent move - puts fou leblanc en prise and now the h3 white pawn may fall next move. 58. hxg4 - only one black pawn left, but ……. 58. ……. h3 - there is no stopping the remaining black pawn so i now wave the white flag.  although it is an expert loss at least i livened things up a bit in the endgame and took the fight to my opponent.  sadly it did not pay off.  well played wolfgang, you certainly deserved your expert status.  kind regards - joanne 
-------------------------------------
i started this game with a bit of trepidation. we were out-graded on all boards including this one. however we managed to win the match 2.5-1.5 it was played on the lichess site. his id there is eastcoker, mine is charleshiggie this of course is the sicilian defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_defence this is the main line. he opts for the open variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_defence#open_sicilian:_2.nf3_and_3.d4 i take he takes back. i attack e4 he defends it. i play the main line - also called the classical he plays the richter–rauzer attack. the move 6.bg5 was kurt richter's invention, threatening to double black's pawns after bxf6 and forestalling the dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable. for the time being i prevent the doubling of my pawns. after 6...e6, vsevolod rauzer introduced the modern plan of qd2 and 0-0-0 in the 1930s. white's pressure on the d6-pawn often compels black to respond to bxf6 with ...gxf6, rather than recapturing with a piece (e.g. the queen on d8) that also has to defend the d-pawn. this weakens black's kingside pawn structure, but in return black gains the two bishops and a central pawn majority. the usual reply, preventing white from playing a piece to b5 and preparing b7-b5 as vsevolod rauzer recommended.  i have to protect nc6 before advancing the b pawn. the usual prelude to a king-side attack by white. i have to react fast on the queen-side.  the usual move, giving up the two bishops but in return weakening black's pawn structure. black cannot take back with the queen because of  qxf6 11. e5 dxe5 12. ndxb5! with a huge advantage to white. so i take back with the pawn. he takes here. i take back. he puts his king to a safer square. i get my queen out. the usual central thrust. but his last move leaves his e5 square weak, so i prepare to occupy it with my queen. his bishop comes out. with my weakened king-side i decided to castle queen-side. he threatens to take on e6 and then on f6 so i protect f6 this is a really interesting move. to exchange queens or not? with the queens off the board i can stop worrying about my king position, but against that he may be able to exploit my weak pawns in an ending. fritz actually thinks black shouldn't exchange queens and likes bb7 here, with an edge to white, however....  i took and he naturally takes back. i intend to try and force him to play g2-g3 and then i play h7-h5-h3 and exchange my isolated h pawn. fritz prefers kd7. but he strikes on this side. so i take. he takes back with check. king up. he threatens to take on e6 twice. so my king comes across to protect. this is rather kind of him - he does the move i was hoping to induce. so i go back to my plan. fritz prefers rb8 with equality. again, i was very happy that he had played this, straightening out my pawns. i take back. bold sacrifice by him. patzer sees a pawn, patzer takes a pawn. fritz here likes 24. rxf6 and if 24....bxf6 then 25. rxd6+ followed by taking on e6 with check, and an advantage to white in all variations, although black is still in the game. instead fortunately white makes an oversight.  he plays this. so i take. this pin is going to win the piece back - but i had something prepared.  fritz says kc7 is stronger. the reason for this will become apparent later. it just seems natural to keep the king with the pawns, but as we shall see, this should have been a fatal mistake. he takes. but i have this move. he tries this. i take his bishop. fritz prefers ra8. he throws in the check. of course not kf8?? rd8# fritz now gives 29. rd6 with the threat of rb6 and rb8 mate. black can defend with rg5 meeting 30. rb6 with rb5 but then white exchanges rooks and plays 32. ra8+ and picks up black's rook on h8 and wins. thankfully he misses this. but if on move 25 i had played kc7 instead of ke7?? white would not have had this resource. thankfully he plays this instead. so i prevent rd7-b7 he threatens mate. easily parried he advances his past c pawn. i throw in a check his king comes up the board. and i set about activating my rooks. he takes. i take back. his king attacks my pawn. i take his pawn. if he takes my pawn i take his and then exchange a rook with ra2+ and i have a won ending. so he does this instead. i throw in a check. king advances i take with check king up again. the problem is this pawn is now a monster he threatens rf8 mate. i defend he checks king across again. pawn advances and so does mine - and he can't stop this, so white resigned. many thanks for reading about this rather lucky win. please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system so that i know how i am doing. until next time dear reader!

e' sempre antipatica questa inchiodatura per me è stato questo l'errore chiave del bianco, stavo cercando di fare un po' di pressione, ma non avevo ancora trovato qualcosa di convincente.  arrocco perso! da qui in poi ho cercato di attaccare con mosse che prevedessero una difesa quasi obbligata, in modo da evitare il riorgarnizzarsi del nero e nello specifico il mio intento era quello di non far entrare in gioco la torre h1 l'alfiere bianco mi bloccava un po', quindi il cambio tutto sommato non mi è dispiaciuto era già un paio di turni che cercavo di trovare il modo di rendere efficace: cb3 per coprire la difesa della donna sul cavallo bianco  e per poi dare scacco con la donna in b5 con minaccia al cavallo bianco in a4, ma non ho trovato un modo per diferdermi dalla contropresa del mio cavallo in b3. vi viene in mente qualcosa? forse era meglio provare a difendere il pedone... mossa decisiva  
-------------------------------------
  tjah... võrdsus on mustale üsna kergesti olemas, aga partii ajal mõtlesin rohkem sellele, kuidas seisu võitluslikkust tekitada. leidsin, et mingil hetkel on pärast ratsude vahetust e4-l olemas f7-f5... varem on siin mängitud 18. od2, mis paistiski mulle partii ajal selgelt paremana. leili mõtles siin kaua... ma arvestasin üksnes odakäiguga ning ei saanud aru, mille üle vastane mõtteid mõlgutab.  must haarab initsiatiivi. viga. parem oli 20. le2, millele parimaks vastuseks peaks olema 20...c4.  loomulikult ei kavatsenud ma võtta d5-le. nüüd nõrgestub valge kuningaseis ning tänu valge mahajäämusele arengus saan tempoga tagasi ka etturi. suur paremus on mustal ka pärast 25. ob2 f4  ei kõlba 26. lc2 le4 27. lxe4 vd1+ 28. kg2 fxe4 tapva sidumisega 1. real.  kiiresti võitis 27... vd6 28. lf1 vg6+ 29. kh2 oh4 30. ve1 lf3, sest valged ei saa kaitsta f-etturit - 31. ve2 og3+ valge ületas aja, kuid seis on muidugi täiesti kaotatud. 0-1 
-------------------------------------
mood. tegelikult polnud mul teooriast erilist aimu, kuid uskusin ideedest üht-teist ikka teadvat. tundub, et avangus jäi tal pisut arusaamisest puudu. see käik oli mulle kergeks üllatuseks, aga tegelikult on nii mänginud paljud (ivantšuk jt). see rõõmustas mind. ettur a5 jääb edaspidi musta seisu krooniliseks nõrkuseks, parem on 9... o-o 10. a5.  nüüd ei õnnestu mustal enam arendada ratsut b6-le... üldse paistab mustal headest ideedest puudu tulevat. valmistab ette c2-c4. pidasin ainuvõimalikuks käiku 14... og4, millele vastanuks 15. le1. must võidab nüüd hetkeks etturi, kuid valgete kaksikodad muutuvad ülitugevaks.  parem oli 18... og5, tekitades valgete ridadesse pisut ebakõlasid. otsisin siin tükk aega kohest võitu, kuid musta õnneks on neil olemas kaitsekäik rd6-e8. mis ei kaunista muidugi eriti musta seisu.  taas pikema mõtlemise järel. aga see ongi parim käik ka arvuti meelest. valge võtab etturi tagasi ja läheb soodsasse lõppmängu. 27. lf3 ei meeldinud mulle lg5 tõttu. nonii. lõppmäng on valgele selgelt soodsam, sest must ei tohi etturi b4 nõrkuse tõttu vahetada lippe. valged haaravad nüüd kiirelt oma kätte ka tsentraalliinid, ilma et must jõuaks vankrit aktiviseerida. ! edasine mäng sujus kiirelt ja ilma erilise mõtlemiseta. butuc on terane ehk segastes seisudes, kuid lõppmängus ei suutnud ta vastupanu osutada. viimane viga. lipulõppmäng on väga kergesti võidetud. 1-0

partiis becerra rivero - kamski käidi siin 24... veb8  pikema mõtlemise järel sündis nybäcki peas uus plaan. varasemates partiides mängiti mustadega rb7, millele järgnes b3-b4, aga siin pole ka musta vankrit a8-l. seda võimalust hakkasin arvestama alles siis, kui olin oma käigu rh5 juba ära teinud. partii ajal lugesin, et ei saa lüüa ei oda ega ratsuga h6-le - ometi pole asi sugugi nii lihtne ning mustalt on vaja ülitäpset kaitset - 31. rxh6+ oxh6 32. oxh6 rd4 järel ma enam eriti asja edasi ei uurinud, kuid selgub, et valge saab jätkata kahistiilis 33. le3! nüüd peab must olema täpne - 37...vxa1! 34. vxa1 rxc2 35. lg5 ld8! (35... rxa1?? 36. rf6+ kh8 37. of8 lõpeb matiga) 36. va8!! lxg5 37. vxe8+ kh7 38. oxg5 gxh5 39. oe7 oxc4! 40. vd8! oe6 41. oxd6 ning lõppmäng v+e vs 2r on viigiline.  väga huvitav on ka odaga löömine 31. oxh6 partii ajal lugesin, et kaotan - 31... oxf5 32. exf5 rd4, kuid arvutianalüüs tõestab vastupidist - valged võidavad! 33. lg4 vxa1 34. vxa1 oxh6 35. fxg6 rxc2 36. gxf7+ kxf7 37. lf5+! ke7 38. lh7+ kd8 39. va8+ rb8 40. lxh6 ning viguri eest on valgel 2 etturit ja võimas rünnak. mustal on aga olemas palju tugevam vastus 31...oxh6!! 32. rxh6+ kf8! 33. rg3 (33. vxa8 vxa8 34. rf6 rd4 35. rxd7+ kg7!! 36. ld1 lxd7 37. rg4 oxg4 38. hxg4 va2 39. od3 le7 ülekaaluka seisuga mustale) 33... va3 ning musta vigurid valitsevad lauda, valge enamettur aga ei anna end üldse tunda. nybäck oli sel hetkel tegelikult juba parajas ajapuuduses (ca 5 min 40.käiguni)... huvitav, kas ta oleks need variandid laua taga leidnud? valge puhub taganemissignaali. etturit jahtida ma ei julgenud - 38. va4 va8! 39. vxb4 lc7 järel kartsin musta vastumängu d6-d5.  pisukese mõtlemise järel leidsin valgele tugevad ratsumanöövrid. ! ratsu tuleb ideaalsele väljale f2, kust saab edasi liikuda g4-le või d3-le. taas oli võimalik võtta ettur 45. oxc5 vd2 46. lb1 lc6 47. oa7! , kuid eelistasin selle asemel rahulikku ja kindlat plaani.   ratsu leidis taas väga hea välja, kus blokeerib musta vabaetturit d4 ning ähvardab musta ettureid c5 ja b4. pisikese kõhkluse järel otsustasin alustada ise mängu võidule. parem oli kohe minna lõppmängu 51... lxf4! 52. rxf4 oc8 53. rd3 g5! 54. rxc5 f5! ning must jõuab alustada vastumängu kuningatiival ja vabaetturi d4 toetusel - 55. e5 g4! 56. rd3 kg6 57. rxb4 gxf3 58. gxf3 f4! usun, et kaotada valge siiski ei riski...  paremat polnud. lugesin siin varianti valesti, uskudes et jõuan kuningaga õigel hetkel d4-le. analüüs näitab, et valge peaks võitma variandis 62. ke1! oh5 63. rc2 kd6 64. rxb4 ke5 65. rd5! bg6 66. rc3! kd4 67. kd2 oh7 68. re2+! kxe4 69. b4! kahjuks oli mul mõtlemisaega vaid veidi üle 10 minuti ning kahe käigu vahel valides tegin vale otsuse.  käiku 62.c5 arvestades tundus mulle, et mu kuningas on juba d4-l ning võidan variandis 66.rd5 ke6 67.c6.    kui nägin, et võitu pole, otsustasin veel väheke nõksutada ning vastast eksima panna.  no jälle jäi natukene puudu... musta oda õnnetu asendi tõttu on laual kerge käigupuudus.   ja ikkagi saab must viigi... viik. 
-------------------------------------
partiiks ette valmistades nägin, et teooriat teadnuks vastane päris korralikult, kuid millegipärast otsustas ta hakata laua taga midagi uut leiutama.  sihikul on ettur c4. mustal on nüüd meeldiv võimalus valida hetk, millal vahetada välja valge rünnakuoda d3. valge eelnev mäng viitas justkui soovile alustada pealetungi kuningatiival... see käik ei lähe f2-f4-ga muidugi üldse kokku. mustal on juba ähvardus ra5 ning valgel on raskusi etturite e4 ja c4 kaitsmisega. jällegi hea uudis mustale. väli d4 kuulub nüüdsest musta viguritele ning mustaväljalisele odale pole enam oponenti. kohe pärast selle käigu kämist sain aru, et kiirustasin pisut. parem olnuks algul 18... g6 ning valgete võimalused kuningatiival rünnata on päris pisikesed.  kartsin siin 19... g6 peale 20. f5 le7 21. rg4, kuid sellele olnuks olemas tugev vastumäng  21... oh4! 22. g3 exf5!  kulutasin eelmisel käigul olles uue plaani leidmiseks päris palju mõtlemisaega ja ei raatsinud enam seda kulutada variantide 20... od8 21. f5 h5 vmt peale. tegelikult kuluks mustal mustaväljaline oda kindlasti ära... pidi loomulikult lööma 21. rxf6+ lxf6, partii ajal pidasin musta seisu pisut paremaks variandis 22. ve1 e5 23. f5 vb8. õige ta ju on, aga suurem ülekaal olnuks kahjuks ikkagi hajunud.  ! äärmiselt ebameeldiv torge. valge ei soovi järgnevalt liigutada oma g-etturit, mis nõrgestaks pikka diagonaali. mustal on korralik paremus ka variandis 22. g3 of3 23. oe2 rxe2+ 24. rxe2 oxg4 25. gxh4 lb6.  nonii, musta etturid alustavad edasitungi - vankrite toel jõuavad nad üllatavalt kiiresti 2. reale (!). ratsut ei pidanud üldse e5-le tagasi laskma, kuid kartsin pisut oma kuninga eest kõigi etturitega plagama panemist - siiski 24... h5 25. lh3 g5 26. rf2 f5 oli tegelikult väga tugev.  paljudes variantides kummitas vastulöök b2-b4.  ? no odal pole b1-l küll midagi teha. punkti g2 ja 2.rida pidi kaitsma näiteks käiguga 28. vd2, sellele plaanisin vastata 28...lg5 29. vf1 lh6 ning ei kõlba näiteks 30. rd7 e5! 31. rxc5 oc6 32. rd5 lxe3+ 33. rxe3 oe7 34. ra6 og5 võiduseisuga mustale.  taas väike kingitus mustale. visam oli 30. vd2 og5 31. ve1 lh6 32. g3. must ei taha isegi vankrit - pisut tuli lugeda vaid varianti pärast 37.oh7+ musta strateegia täielik võit.  
-------------------------------------
vastane mängis siin ja edasipidi kiiresti, mina mõtlesin teooriat välja... rybka olla tugevamaks pidanud käiku ve1... nu f2-le on igatahes palju loogilisem. valge plaanib nüüd vd2, lg1 jmt käike. mnjah... otsustasin lahingu vastu võtta, alternatiiv oli 15.a3. uuendus! partiis gallagher-alterman, 1994 mängiti 15... b4 16. re4 soodsama seisuga valgele.  analüüs näitab, et mustal on kõikjal hea. 1). 17. oxc6 vxc6 18. rc5 vxc5 (või 18... vd6 19. vxd6 exd6 20. rxe6 fxe6 21. lxd6 exf4 22. lxe6+ kh8 23. og1 re5) 19. oxc5 le8 20. oe3 exf4 21. oxf4 rb6  või 2). 17. od5 oxd5 18. vxd5 vc7 19. rc5 rcb8!

põnev avanguvariant, kus valged hiljem tihtipeale positsioonilise kvaliteedikahinguga musta mängu blokeerivad. seda käiku ei peeta just parimaks. kuna mul variandi mängimise praktika eriti suur polnud, siis pani see siiski mõtlema. hämmastaval kombel ma ei märganud üldse tugevat võimalust  15. qxd5! ning pärast 15...bxe5 16. qxe5 qxe5 17. bxe5 ra7 18. bxg7 rg8 19. bf6 on valgel lõppmängus suur paremus.  etturi löömine viib kuristikku: 18... qxa2 19. rb8! o-o 20. bb7! qc4 (20... bxb7 21. rxf8+ kxf8 22. qd8#) 21. qd6 g6 (või 21... re8 22. bxc8 rxc8 23. qd8+) 22. qxf8+ kxf8 23. rxc8+ qxc8 24. bxc8 enamviguriga.  valgel on väike, aga selge ülekaal. mustal on raskusi oc8 mängutoomisega, kui valge c-ettur  hakkab edasi liikuma, siis valmistab seegi mustale muresid. lisaks tiirutavad valged vigurid ka musta kuninga ümber... parem oli kohe käia 22. bf3, säilitades muuhulgas ka ähvarduse lh4+ näitlik variant: 22...h6 23. rd1 qb6 24. rxd8 qxd8 25. qb4+ qd6 26. qc3 bd7 27. qxg7 etturivõiduga.  ei sobinud 22... kf8 23. bf3. nüüd nõrgeneb musta 7. rida.  julge käik. pidasin seda algul veaks, arvestades variante a la 23... h6 24. qg4 kf7 25. rd1 qb6 26. rxd8 qxd8 27. qh5+ kg8 28. c4 selge ülekaaluga.  ?? kaotab kohe. üllatusena märkasin analüüsides, et nii 26... ke8, kui ka 26... rd6 27. rc3 qd2 28. rc7+ bd7 29. qb8 ei annagi valgele midagi erilist. vähemetturi kompenseerivad valge aktiivsed vigurid, kuid c-ettur olnuks valgele hilisemas mängus tugevaks trumbiks... nüüd on see laualt lihtsalt lahkunud.

conventional enough. he plays the modern. i continue classically. he develops. i develop a bishop. of course i can't take or b2 falls. so i defend. he takes. i take back. this is usual. i develop. threatening nf6-g4. which i stop. he castles. this position is a little like the way i play white side of the sämisch variation of the king's indian defence.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence,_s%c3%a4misch_variation he avoids the exchange of bishops with bh6, but i am not sure that this is his best. i develop. and so does he. i start my attack. i think this is mistimed.  with the centre closed, my king is in less danger. he retreats. his position is a bit cramped now. bringing the knight into the attack. he continues to develop. my attack continues a pace. i think he makes a mistake in ignoring my king side play. which trundles on. he continues with his queen side play. i open the h file. if now nxg6 then g4-g5 wins his knight. so he takes this way. now of course nh5 just loses a pawn for him, but that is probably better than what he tried. he tries to counter attack. i just take. he takes. ok what would you play as white now? did you spot it? no need to waste a more recapturing. i'm threatening to take on h7 and then mate him. http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=164774 he tries this. now find white's move again! did you see it? if he takes the knight i recapture with the queen and am mating him. he tries this, but now he gets mated. i love the way my knight jumps into the position! he tries this. my king is perfectly safe here. there is nothing better. it is mate no matter what black plays. so he does this. ok, find the mate in 3! did you find it? this lasts one move longer than kf8. but this leads to mate! many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system.

seems, we both know the ropes...  this gives us 2 queens pawns... háh!... black reached a favourable position... loses tempo, better first 10. a5 rc8... the only way, to stir up some dust, and some forced moves... 13. f3 nf6 (or nb8, e4, nc6) 14. e4 rfe8 (too early for qh5, etc.) 15. exd5 exd5 16. ne2 is probably better... i liked this better, then 15. ... qf6 16. re3 d5 17. a5!... whites second d-pawn comes in handy, now. better, then 16. ... qa5 17. ne4 (b4, qxb4, rb1, qa5, rxb7, nf6) rc6 18. rg3 qb6 19. b3! 17. a5 qg6 18. qxg6 hxg6 19. ra4 is probably better... 18. nd1 nf6 19. a5 ne4... no good is 19. ... kh8 20. rh3 h6 21. g4! qe7 22. f4! 20. qd2 kh8 21. ... nf6... any idea's, for white? the main threat now, is nb6... 22. f4 nb6 23. f5 exf5 24. qh6 r6c7 25. rh3 f6 26. qh4 re8 27. qxf6 nxa4... 23. rb1 a5... pawn a4 is lost, after all my warnings... 26. qa1 qxa1 27. rxa1 b4, is surely better... now follows a forced continuation, and black reaches a favourable position... slowly, but surely, white is losing control over the situation... 34. g3 kg7... hurry up, now: 34. ... h4 35. kf2... postponing f6, as well as qa2... never spoil a good threat... 36. kg3, probably qf1! 37. h4 kf6... i liked this better, then 37. ... f6 38. h3 kf7... we threaten deadly a3... 38. qb4 qb1... 40. kh3 qf3... probably, the winning move... more forced continuations... 42. kd3 qf3+ 43. kd3 h4!  44. kf3 kf5... without further adue... even without kings - only pawns - black will win this... in that case f6... 46. kc3 ke4... 46. kd3 h4... this is worse... another forcing, on poor white... relentless... white is in zugzwang, and will lose all of his pawns... white resigned...

this is another ladder game against a significantly higher ranked player. in this one i had serious hopes of a draw. it all starts with the english opening. the computer gives white a very slight edge here, presumably due to blacks soon to be doubled pawns. i don't want the knight pinned due to blacks threat of nd4 i'm guessing from this that black isn't intending to castle in the forseeable future.  although the computer doesn't complain about this move i'm not sure it was the wisest as it opens a line for the black rook to my soon to be castled king this was a bit of a suprise, the computer calls it an inaccuracy preferring … qg5 16. bxd4 cxd4 17. qa4 rc8. i rarely get a material advantage against such a high ranked player without a lot of pain following soon after but i couldn't see here what that might be the computer calls this a mistake preferring 20. o-o o-o-o 21. qg4+ rd7 22. rad1 kc7 but my plan was to gain a little more material in the hope that i would stand a chance of getting a draw this is something i never usually see, a move that the computer calls a blunder from a high ranked player due to … a5 21. qe6+ kf8 22. qxd6+ kg8 23. o-o qe3+ 24. kh2 qxd3 25. qxc6 kh7 26. c5 rhb8 27. bxa5 rxa5 28. qc7 rab5 29. rxf6 rxc5 this was pure greed and the computer calls it a mistake. i figured with being 3 pawns ahead my chances of a draw were fair to good. i was expecting re8 though i guess that black wanted to avoid the forced queen exchange resulting from qf5, this does however lose a pawn. i can't say i am totally thrilled with having doubled pawns here though i still had hopes of a draw, the computer gives white a fair advantage at this point i'm more than happy to exchange pawns. looking to grab blacks a pawn so that i can support my b pawn. this is a mistake due to 51. b7 kc7 52. ka6 kb8 53. rb6 rd8 54. re6 rh8 55. h6 gxh6 56. rxf6 rd8 57. rxh6 re8 58. g5 rg8 59. g6 re8 60. rh7 re6+ 61. kb5  best was 51. rc4 rb8 52. rc7+ kd6 53. rxg7 f5 blunder: +1.91 » 53. rxa4 re6+ 54. kb5 kxb7 55. rf4 rb6+ 56. ka5 re6 57. a4 re7 58. kb4 re5 59. rc4 ka6 60. rc6+ kb7 61. rc5 re4+ 62. rc4 re2 63. a5  best: +6.13 » 53. rb6 rf8 54. re6 rd8 55. h6 gxh6 56. rxf6 re8 57. rxh6 rd8 58. g5 rf8 59. rc6 rd8 60. rf6 re8 61. g6 kc7 62. g7 kb8 63. rf8  despite this the computer still thinks white has the edge i thought by doing this i might get to promote a pawn. nxh6 would be better this is the first of two mistakes which lost me the game: -   mistake: -0.02 » 64. rg6+ re6 65. rg8 re4+ 66. kb3 rh4 67. rd8+ ke5 68. rd1 h2 69. rh1 kf5 70. a5 kxg5 71. a6 rh3+ 72. kc4 rh7 73. a7 rxa7 74. rxh2 best: +1.72 » 64. rh7 rxg5 65. rxh3 kc6 66. rh4 rd5 67. re4 rd1 68. re6+ rd6 69. re2 kb6 70. a5+ ka6 71. ra2 rc6+ 72. kd5 rf6 73. kd4 rf4+ 74. kc5 and all of a sudden black is ahead despite my material advantage  mistake: -2.86 » 65. rg7 re4+ 66. kb5 rh4 67. rg6+ kd5 68. rc6 h2 69. rc5+ ke6 70. rc6+ kd7 71. rc1 h1=q 72. rxh1 rxh1 73. a5 rg1 74. kb6 kd6 75. a6 best: -0.02 » 65. rg8 re4+ 66. kb3 rh4 67. rd8+ ke5 68. rd1 h2 69. rh1 kf5 70. a5 kxg5 71. a6 rh3+ 72. kc4 rh7 73. a7 rxa7 74. rxh2 ra4+ 75. kd5 very well played by black. once again i have thrown away a material advantage against a significantly higher ranked player. my consolation in this game was that i survived over 60 moves. maybe one day there will be a different result.  thanks for reading, please comment

this was a ladder challenge from an opponent who was over 200 points north of my rating at the start of the game. i got into a good position and managed to completely blunder it away. from move 15 on, the analysis shows something wrong with almost all my moves. sadly for me by this point my opponent had woken up and stopped his similar sequence in the first half of the game i've been playing kings gambit quite a bit and so wanted to stay on relatively familiar territory. the first mistake of the game  mistake: +0.81 » … nf6 7. bxf4 be7 8. nc3 bg4 9. h3 bh5 10. e5 dxe5 11. dxe5 nd7 12. ne4 o-o 13. e6 nc5 14. exf7+ bxf7 best: -0.63 » … g5 7. qd3 na5 8. na3 nxc4 9. nxc4 be7 10. bd2 nf6 11. e5 dxe5 12. nfxe5 o-o the analysis calls this a mistake but then gives a line which ends with me +2 on material.  mistake: +3.36 » … bd7 13. qe4 g6 14. bxh6 re8 15. qf4 bf8 16. bxf8 rxf8 17. exd6 cxd6 18. qxd6 bg4 19. ne4 nc6 20. ne5 qxd6 21. nxd6 nxe5 22. dxe5 best: +0.76 » … d5 13. be3 nc6 14. a3 bg4 15. qf2 be6 16. qg3 kh8 17. qf4 re8 18. kh1 ng5 qe4 would have been better here  the analysis gives me +4.37 here, which is the most i achieved in this game and i quite liked my position here, i have the bishop pair and his knight on a5 doesnt' seem to be doing anything useful.  i'm trying to work out how to get the most from the b1h7 diagonal, this seemed a decent move to me but the analysis calls it a mistake. i felt i had some chances here but was worried about messing it up   mistake: +1.81 » 15. qe4 f5 16. qe1 nc6 17. exd6 cxd6 18. qg3 rad8 19. rae1 nb4 20. bxh6 rf6 21. bf4 nxd3 22. cxd3 qd7 23. b3 best: +4.37 » 15. exd6 qd7 16. b4 nc6 17. bxh7+ kxh7 18. d5 bxd5 19. qd3+ kh8 20. qxd5 cxd6 21. qxd6 qxd6 22. bxd6 rfe8 looking at sacrificing the bishop on h6. however black doesn't allow that and all of a sudden the position is more equal this move pretty much seals my fate as it loses my dsb this is a terrible move, i have no idea what i was thinking at this point i'd had enough, i'd managed to go from a relatively good position to complete defeat in the space of a handful of moves.  thanks for reading please comment 
-------------------------------------
at the time this game started i was in the midst of a slump in form. to add insult to injury i had a few challenges from much higher ranked players on the slow ladder. this is one of those games  annotation is available at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=26566808&rnd=0.06266435291659667  clearly it would be suicidal to play an opening i'm not familiar with so i start with kings gambit which is the one i was most familiar with at the time. i was also hoping my opponent wasn't too familiar with it. gambit accepted the computer analysis calls this a mistake and prefers  ne7 8. d3 bh6 9. qe1 qxe1+ 10. kxe1 a6  the analysis likes this. for the first time in the game my score goes positive threatens to regain the pawn that was gambitted pretty much forced as black won't want to be a pawn down computer calls this a mistake, preferring rxh2 ... my intention here really was to simply defend the bishop  this was completely unexpected, i can't see here what black was attempting to do. i was expecting black to develop a piece i'm not going to refuse a free pawn especially one that threatens a fork with king and rook. the analysis now puts white firmly in the lead. looking at the position black seems underdeveloped to me so i'm going to try to take advantage, initially be denying black the ability to castle. the analysis prefers gxf3 but i was happy to exchange queens as it reduces blacks active pieces and allows me to achieve my short term objective of forcing the black king to move - losing the ability to castle. pretty much forced otherwise black will lose a pawn i like this move as blacks kingside knight and rook are pretty much trapped in and the king is restricted to the 8th rank. not only that, but blacks knight on b8 can only really move to d7 which leads nowhere at the moment.  tempting as it is i'm not going to take blacks bishop as that will free up his kingside pieces. its seems to me that the best thing i can do is take advantage of my space advantage to restrict the options for black. i suspect black is trying to get something going here but i'm not moving my lsb off this diagonal firming up my pawn chain and preventing nb4 should he be considering it considering forcing an exchange of knights followed up with bh6 i'd like to keep my bishops though i did consider g3 would give me a very nice pawn chain if he took ie 23. g3, nxf4, 24. gxf4   i also need to be wary of the fork on e3 although it's well defended at the moment. isolates his pawns as cxb5 loses to bxd5 forced.   blacks rook on b6 now looks rather uncomfortable this was intended to prevent nf4 as i'm going to try to move the knight with c4. i'm still not sure if g4 would have been better the analysis calls this as mistake, i call it a suprise as i wasn't expecting this even though blacks options are limited no way would i have exchanged pawns, i think that would have been a mistake. this move gives me connected passed pawns. as long as i can keep them connected i think i am in with a chance here, blacks position is still looking cramped to me though he is trying hard to change that. analysis prefers h5 here, i was tempted to exchange with nxd6 but i liked that the black king was trapped.  the idea here was nxd6 rxd6 bxc5 forking the rook but of course black isn't going to allow that  the analysis is that this is a blunder but the explanation doesn't make much sense to me as to why it's a blunder and not an inaccuracy, white still ends up ahead this is a blunder due to  … ne7 32. bh6+ kg8 33. be8 nxf5 34. bf7# however i didn't see that.  i felt in this position black was unlikely to exchange unless he had a clear advantage  the analysis however calls this a blunder, partly i presume because of the previously noted mate. the computer prefers nc7 here however the line given still ends up +5 on material to white. i think this is where black spotted the mate if white gets his bishop to f7 this is where i spotted the mate from bf7  the analysis gives mate in 11 however i will leave that as an exercise for the reader the idea here was to force my way through with rxe5 analysis calls this a blunder and prefers its mate in 9 35. g5 bf8 36. gxf6 bxh6 37. nxh6+ kf8 38. ba4 ng6 39. d6 rb7 40. e7+ nxe7 41. dxe7+ rxe7 42. rd8+ re8 43. rxe8# analysis calls this a blunder however it was intended to maintain the plan to blunt force with rxe5 of course black is going to fool that plan and here is how. it was around this point i decided to change tactics in favour of elimination, this bishop can gain a pawn and exchange for a rook. given that my form had recently been on the decline i just need to be sure i don't do anything stupid and end up losing. this was totally unexpected, i was expecting ne8, bxh8, if kxh8 bxg6 continuing with my elimination plan, i can't see that black can do much to prevent it this was another unexpected move from black - not that he had many options however this opens the g file for my rook to attack the king it's all too late for black now, even i can see a mate here kh7 was equally hopeless due to rg7# i'd like to thank my opponent for this game, if it's any consolation i learnt a lot from his play and am sure i can learn even more from analysing the game further.   i was delighted with the result. not only is this the highest ranked player i have beaten i also felt that this was more deserved than some of my other wins against higher ranked players.  please comment 
-------------------------------------
when this tournament game started, my opponent was a good 100 points north of my rating. if i'd won he would be the highest ranked player i had beaten for some considerable time. the game started when my confidence was high. i had just completed reading sierawans strategy book which for me consolidated and added to some of the ideas i had already and which resulted in my rating skyrocketing by about 100 points to the highest its ever been, so i was optimistic.   the tournament itself was meant to be kga but very few games started like that. this is van't kruijs opening which i'm not familiar with computer analysis calls this an inaccuracy but i can't really see how to take advantage of this. as i'm not familiar with this opening at all i'm going for early safety and aiming to castle soon. this should give me a little time to see what my opponent is up to this takes us out of the gameknot database. the aim is prohylaxis, it limits the white dsbs threats into my kingside. as it happens this is maintaned for much of the game. the double fianchetto has been successfully used against me in the past so i thought i would try it here. this seems a good spot for my lsb i was quite pleased by this as i don't want to damage my little pawn chain, the problem of course is that my lsb is now not so well placed which i'm sure is whites intent. trying to keep the lsb active. analysis calls this a mistake. i was more generous and thought of it as a high risk move that was intended to open up whites king and scare him a little, i can get my queen and both knights into the attack and push my kingside pawns, even though white has space he has little scope for manoeuvre just at the moment, though of course that can change quickly. i'm unsure that i can see the point of this move. interestingly the analysis calls it a mistake preferring 24. axb6 cxb6 25. ra4 nf5 26. qe2 analysis also calls this a mistake but my aim was to get rid of a defender and bring my other knight in . my dsb can now support a pawn push  analysis calls this a mistake preferring  … kf8 29. kg2 ng8 30. bc1 bxc1 31. rfxc1 nf6 but for me at the time it was part of my plan i was hoping to avoid the rook exchange but white has forced it. the white knight has limited options and can then be threatened by my dsb analysis calls this a mistake. i would prefer to keep a rook i'm unsure about this move, the idea was to reduce the risk that white would exchange knights as he would lose a pawn. better may have been rf8 not ideal for white but the only way he can protect his pawn on c4 this is a blunder due to 38. ne3 bxe3 39. fxe3 rf8 40. ra1 nxe3  unfortunately for me i didn't quite see that... ... and i blundered too ( 38. ne3 bxe3 39. fxe3) luckily for me white didn't spot it and blundered too.  this gave me some hope that i may be able to push the white king into a corner and make life difficult for him analysis puts black significantly ahead for the first time in the game the white king is trapped into a corner and i have three passed pawns, things are looking up. at this point i was optimistic that i might win or at worst draw. this is obviously a gamble for white  i got hesitant as i didn't want to give white a passed pawn.   analysis here prefers  … dxe5 42. nxe5 h3+ 43. kg3 bf4+ 44. kxg4 h2 45. ra1 bxe5 46. rh1 rf4+ 47. kh3 rxc4  obviously this was coming, i just hoped i could hold my nerve long enough to ride it out at this point my slim chances of winning had all but evaporated. all of my checking suggested that the game could now be drawn, so i somewhat reluctanly aimed at a draw. by this point i had convinced myself that this was a draw i couldn't see here what was was attempting i didn't realise at the time but this was the single move that meant i lost. best is … ba3 57. ne8 kxb5 58. nxd6+ kc5 59. ne4+ kc4 60. d6 bxd6 61. nxd6+ kc5 62. nb7+ kd4 63. nd6 which i would have been very happy with. i think it was about here when i finally realised what white was doing but it was too late. this was my final blunder. analysis suggests …   once again i have proved to myself that one move can lose a game, i just need to remember that lesson now! 
-------------------------------------
this is the 8th of my long running series of how not to play chess. in this particular game i felt as though i successfully managed to grasp defeat from the jaws of victory.  this is a genuine case of a game of two halves. it was a ladder game which resulted from a challenge from armorpawn. i find it's common in ladders to get challenges from much higher rated players, my challenge in these cases is to give them something to think about. the action starts with the english opening. this isn't a move i often play in the english and the computer calls it a mistake preferring d3. in the gameknot databases there are only two games both of which were won by white. this takes us out of the gameknot database where bxg1 is preferred i've been experimenting with d3 in the english and i'm still not sure how sound it is, the hole it tends to create in d4 makes me uncomfortable. the computer calls this a mistake due to 9. be2 h6 10. bd2 o-o 11. rb1 be6 12. b4 ba7 13. a4 qd7 14. h4 nxe2 15. qxe2 b5 16. h5 bxa4 17. nxa4 but i can't see anything in there which makes it so bad this wasn't the best exchange for me as i have now lost my good bishop i'm reluctant to castle kingside due to the black bishop staring down the diagonal this threw me at first then i realised that taking the queen results in a royal fork. the computer calls this a blunder … qxf3 14. nxd4 qf6 15. nxc6 bxc4 16. dxc4 bd7 17. nb4 qh4 18. nd5 bd4 19. bf3 rac8 20. rc1 f5 21. exf5 bxf5  fortunately for me i spotted some of this sequence myself as we will see suddenly the game has swung in my favour although the computer prefers nxd6 i like this move here. my other knight, bishop and queen can easily get into the action and i can push my two kingside pawns in support, i have the makings of an assault on the black king. the idea is to tempt g6 which fails to qxh6. although this was in my plan i was suprised to see it played, the coomputer agrees, calling it a mistake kf2 is better as it doesn't block my lsb the analysis calls this a mistake preferring 19. dxc4 d5 20. cxd5 cxd5 21. bb3 rfd8 22. qh4 qxh4 23. nxh4 dxe4 24. nxg6 rd2+ 25. ke3 rd3+ 26. kxe4 rxb3 27. axb3 fxg6 28. kxe5  my plan was to turn up the pressure around the black king the computer calls this a mistake -  20. g5 cxd3+ 21. kf2 qh8 22. qxh8+ kxh8 23. ng3 bc5+ 24. kg2 rfb8 25. rb1 rb4 26. kf3 rab8 27. bb3 rxb3 28. axb3 rxb3 29. rbd1 kg7  preferring  20. bc2 rfd8 21. g5 qh8 22. qxh8+ kxh8 23. ne3 cxd3+ 24. kxd3 ra7 25. exd5 cxd5 26. bb3 rad7 27. rhc1 kg7  my idea was to push the black queen away if i could at this point i felt i had been close to pulling off a suprise result but it had started to slip out of my hands and that i needed to try to maintain my material lead in order to stand a chance of maybe getting a draw. and it was all thrown away by this move which i can only describe as temporary madness. now life is a lot more comfortable for black who deservedly punished me for this. this is a blunder as it allows black to force my king back with rf2 which he takes full advantage of by this point i'd had more than enough.   congratulations to black for a thoroughly deserved victory  thanks for reading please comment.

this was a ladder game from a significantly higher ranked player. he blundered in the middle game, which gave me some hope.  analysis is available at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=21294966&rnd=0.9512844220735133. it all starts with the english opening all standard stuff so far though i was a little suprised that black gave up a bishop for a knight, he clearly thought it was a worthwhile exchange this move takes us out of the gameknot database. the computer calls this a mistake preferring 8. be2 nf6 9. cxd5 qxd5 10. o-o e4 the computer also calls this a mistake preferring  … nc5 9. be2 dxc4 10. o-o be6 11. a4 e4 the computer calls this a mistake but i like this square for my queen, it threatens the b7 pawn and is on a nice diagonal with the black king this was a complete suprise and the computer calls it a mistake preferring … nc5 11. qb5 nxd3 12. cxd5 nb8 13. qxd3 e4 1 i figured i can't afford an opportunity to regain my lost material i was half expecting nxc4 here blunder due to 13. qa4 nc5 14. qc2 e4 15. ne5 exd3 16. nxd3 nxd3 17. qxd3 dxc4 18. qc2 nb3  thankfully for me my opponent didn't see the same combination as the computer, this does however give me an opportunity to regain my lost pawn the compouter says nothing about this move but i think its an oversight ... and this is why, threatening the royal fork on e7 this was a complete shock and is called a blunder by the computer i've never been this far ahead in material against such a high ranked opponent and was starting to hope i may even get a draw out of the game if i was very careful i want to push my passed pawn but that will prove difficult i can't recall why i made this move but looking at it now it seems a little pointless my intention here was to sit my dsb on e3 but this never happened hoping to gain more material but this move pretty much lost the game this move pretty much sealed it for black's win, any advantage i had was now gone i decided grabbing material might give me a chance still of a draw ouch. the only consolation for me was that this is the first game ever against such a high rated player where i have been ahead in material by a significant amount and when i have resigned i have been equal on material.  thanks for reading please comment

apertura inglesa a controlar el centro. centro controlado. piexas menores desarrolladas y activas, toca achicar sus espacios. empieza a hacer movimientos dilatorios, no está a gusto, sus piezas menores alejadas del rey; a por él. error, yo aumento la presión. por fin contraataca, hay que defenderse un poco. la defensa parece sólida, hay que atacar. empieza el desmoronamiento... flanco de mi rey difícilmente atacable, él intenta poner su dama en otra posición. a mi me toca enviar piezas al ataque. sin descuidar mi defensa. molesta posición de la dama negra. ¿me la cambias? no. pero me das algo a cambio. no comprendo el movimiento y yo a lo mío, aprovecho el regalo. si no se da cuenta se acaba la partida. no se da cuenta. golpe final. 
-------------------------------------
everything has moved along main line paths until now. also popular is 8.bg5  a very common move in the bf4 and bg5 lines. the white knight is headed to c4 where it can aid in the attack of the d6 point. the d6 point is traditionally the weakest point in black's defense.   two relatively unexplored alternatives for black are 9...ng4 and 9...ne8. both are imo better than the game move. after 9...a6 black has not had much success in top play. mostly because black does better when he resolves the pressure on d6 quickly.    this thematic knight move has been championed by john watson in his book 'starting out: modern benoni' strategically black wants to follow up with ...nd7 and ...ne5 in preparation of ...f7-f5.   !? there is nothing inherently bad about this move but offering to give up your prized bishop for a weaker one is never a good idea. in almost all cases it is black who will miss the dsb as he will have to maintain control of the dark squares with his queen which is easily harassed by the weaker pieces.   anticipating the exchange. so i play to put my knight on a very good square.   overall, i would say that white is doing better. on black side he has managed to resolve the problematic d6 weakness for the foreseeable future. the absence of the dsb means that b7-b5 is highly unlikely. so black must throw everything into making f7-f5 work.   a powerful little move, keeping the knight out of f4 and supporting said f2-f4 advance.   ?! if there is an improvement to be made in this whole line for black it is right here. the logic in this move is to support ...f7-f5 or maybe to play ...ne8 to meet nc4. either way black may have better luck with ...rb8; ...re8 or ...nhf6.   hitting at d6 again.   the knight has moved 4 times already is well traveled. i am anticipating an attack on e4 shortly so nd2 and bg2 should do the trick.   e4 point is now well defended  and here it is  only move  black will try to secure the f-file for operations but this idea seems to not work.   this is where black's missing dsb begins to be felt. black has no chance of succeeding without it. in the meantime, black threatens to win a pawn on b2. however, again the weak d6-pawn becomes liability.   activating the lsb and trying to repel the pressure on d6.   we are pretty much level here though i have to say that white looks much more active.   ?! a very risky move that will cost black dearly. when defending improve your pieces and move pawn only when you have too. better possibly are ...qf6 or ...nf5.   ! black has forgotten that e6 is in dire need of defending.   the computer thinks black is still in this for a draw. it sees that ...qf6 can marshals the defenses on the king side just in time. but what it does not see is how quickly white can gain space and time attacking the queen. the key is that as of yet there is no direct attack against the black king so the computer thinks everything is fine.   now 26...qf6 is forced to try and hold e6 but that is not going to be enough.   the first nail is in the coffin. gaining control of the critical f7-square. the gameknot computer stubbornly thinks black is inferior but still ok.   the bishop can not be taken i.e 28...nxe6 29. dxe6 qe7 30. qd5 should enough to win for white.   this guarantees that i have an enduring dominance on the light squares.   ! a in between move that forces black into a corner. black has no good moves so forcing him to make one is the idea here.   pinning the knight with the idea of 33.b3 and 34.qb2 with a nasty pin on f6.   forced or 33. b3 is to follow  i love moves like this, they are like little can openers that just do so much damage. black falls quickly now as he has too many weak points.   trying to shore up f6 but abandoning the a6-pawn. perhaps ...qe7 is a little better   black can not plug up the holes fast enough  exploiting the pinned knight by threatening to play g5  alternative variation: 37. g5 [?!] 37... hxg5 38. hxg5 nh7 39. rxf8+ nxf8 40. qf4 nxe6 41. dxe6 qe7 42. qe3 [∞] alternative variation: 37. b3 [!?] 37... g5 38. hxg5 hxg5 39. rf5 [is the same as the game]  with the fall of the a6-pawn black resigns after two more moves.   i hope you enjoyed this game.   
-------------------------------------
my standard way of beginning i don't think this is the best, it allows me full control of the center after my 5º move i would have waited a little longer to castle!
-------------------------------------
this is my "bet" on the london. white's push has a very small edge over black's symmetrical. the plan it to leave the black lsb looking freely to the diag, and playing around it. this theme will become crucial during the middlegame.  not in a hurry. and not to c3.  the thematic... threatening nxb, for one side... ...but not playing it, actually, since it is beter for white to try to strangle black, instead of releasing the pressure. besides, it would leave a semiopen column to black, and i'm not ready to defend or to use it to attack.  thematic. the dsb keeps trapped for the rest of the game, but white's central dominion is strong, provided white takes care of the queenside.  again, trying to "strangle" instead of freeing him. and avoiding a nasty qh4, of course. nf3 could be playable, but this is more threatening.  i was tempted to take with the king, so after be4, f3. i didn't dare with a strong opponent like this.  surprising him. i'm planning an inmediate f3.  not whorty for black bxf3, rxb, qxh4+, rg3 and nothing happens.  ...before black takes advantage of my weak queenside. if bxc2, qxb7, rb8, and i think black is better. anyway.  this helps him. the only good is he can't castle kingside.  say we transposed the moves, and here we are. my kingside attack is stopped, and i'm playing indirectly in the center.  unpinning at once the queen.  i knew that this would have helped him a hand, but i couldn't see anything better.  to control the knight, and providing my king a route to the action via dark squares.  now, this is a pawn's game: it is really very difficult to handle in blitz time.  i lost my temper and attacked.  this was intended to be a surprise, but it turned out to be a simple mistake.  better was bf5.  ok. black has won a battle, but not the war.  i thought the bishop has not a good spot, and that better is to get it into the fight and leave the way free for my rook to g1.  i discover my king, but now i have a decent defence against the black's avalanche.  a mistake, in my view. ra-g8 was deadly.  i thought he thought i was so naive to set a trap hoping in a mistake of him.  but no. now, don't ask me why i gave my h pawn. i thought the rook's penetration would be decisive, even considering the e6 refuge his king has.  this was embarassing, and unforseen. right. now i can't move my rook from the g file or i will exchange a rook and lose a pawn (the least) in the process, after rg8 by black.  i'm sure this is not the good one. i justified myself saying that i was looking to get away of the 3º row pawns in order to be able to move my bishop again (sob!)  ...intending f4 without fearing rd8. note that i don't find time to take the b7 pawn.  even here, i was tempted to rxb7, but...  ...this was much more important: to free my bishop. now, i'm offering a clean pawn's exchange, but with a "plus"... ! (i dare). i mean that rxr, rxr+, kmoves and rh2 wins the bishop. so i don't have to take, that's all. but with this move, i also threat... not bxg1, or it will be pinned with rh1.  now that i have the mate in sight, let's try to be clever and use it. can you believe? my opponent played... and, of course, it was... in my language you say: "warned soldier, half-saved soldier". it sound horrible in english, but you get the meaning, don't you? thank you for reading.

this is game 6 of the match where a computer, deep blue, defeated a reigning chess grandmaster, garry kasparov in only 19 moves.  most commentary is by yasser seirawan.  ((comments from wikipedia entry on this game are in double parentheses.))  the garry kasparov versus deep blue match had all the drama of a great epic. going into the last game with the match tied the expectation and excitement had reached fever pitch. my audience had just begun to warm their seats when the game was over! in just over one hour the match was over and we were all left gasping for answers. i hope these comments provide some crucial clues to the most gripping chess event that i've ever had the pleasure to be involved with.  garry's opening choice came as a great disappointment to me. he rarely plays the caro-kann and the opening does not suit his style of play. i had expected and hoped for his vaunted sicilian defense (1...c5) which he plays supremely well. (( somewhat atypically, kasparov plays the solid caro-kann defense. in later matches against computers he opted for 1...e5 or 1...c5, the sharp sicilian defence, kasparov's usual choice against human opponents. )) ((this relatively recent innovation breaks one of the classic opening principles ("don't move the same piece twice in the opening"), but puts pressure on the weak f7 square. kasparov had played this move himself as white at least three times earlier.)) (( not 5...h6? 6.ne6! fxe6?? 7.qh5+ g6 8.qxg6#.( 6....qb6 7.nxf8 nxf8 8.c3 bf5 9.nge2 nf6 10.a4 n8d7 11.ng3 bg6 12.bd3 . deep rybka 3 gives ( 0.13 ) advantage towards white.) )) all of the previous moves are "standard opening theory" played in thousands of games before. kasparov's next move came as a great surprise. the text has a dodgy reputation based on the results of previous games played with this move. while playable, it is definitely not the main line. the normal move is 7...bd6 (first!) 8.qe2 h6 9.ne4 nxe4 10.qxe4 nf6 as has been seen in countless games.  (( a strange blunder by kasparov, one of the most theoretically knowledgeable players in chess history. apparently kasparov got his opening moves mixed up, playing ...h6 a move too early. the normal 7...bd6 8.qe2 h6 9.ne4 nxe4 10.qxe4 was played in kasparov(!)-kamsky, 1994 and kasparov-epishin, 1995, among other games. the upcoming sacrifice is well known to theory and kasparov must have known about it (in fact, there are some reports that he even wrote an article supporting 8.nxe6 as a refutation). objectively speaking, the move may be ok, although the resulting position is very tough for a human player to defend. rajlich later indicated that the decisive error may have been on move 11, pointing out that rybka was prepared to play this in a 2007 computer match. )) this sacrifice is the only chance for white to gain an advantage. after 8.ne4 nxe4 9.bxe4 nf6 10.bd3 c5 is fine for black since he hasn't yet moved his f8-bishop the freeing break ...c6-c5 and the subsequent move ...bf8-c5 doesn't come with the loss of a tempo. therefore the text. however, the effect of white's move had a devastating effect on garry's face. he looked as if he had just been hit by a bolt of lightening. while we were busily speculating if kasparov had come prepared with a novel idea his reaction was manifestly clear, he had transposed his move order and fallen into a well known book trap! how on earth was this possible? garry kasparov is arguably the finest opening theoretician in the world today. how could he fall into a known opening trap? there are several answers. in the post match press conference, garry explained that he had lost his confidence. following the disappointing draw in game five he had told his trainers that, "the match was over." garry had simply given up and went into the game with a losing mentality. too, garry had exhibited signs of increasing nervousness and tension following game two. playing openings and defenses that were unfamiliar to him he had hoped to out fox the computer. he had done so, but, also achieved positions that didn't suit him. following the look of appall on his face following the text garry clinched his head in his hands looked plainly disgusted and banged down his next move swiftly.  (( the computer is aided by having this knight sacrifice programmed into the opening book. this move had been played in a number of previous high-level games, with white achieving a huge plus score. however, had deep blue been on its own, it would probably not have played this. the compensation white gets for the material is not obvious enough for the computer to see by itself. as an indication of how far computer chess has progressed in recent years, modern chess programs running on ordinary desktop computers do find ng5xe6 without their opening books. )) this however is a known mistake. when it rains it pours and mistakes usually come in numbers. for caro-kann players like myself, we are aware that 8...fxe6 9.bg6+ ke7 10.o-o qc7 11. re1 kd8 preparing ...bf8-d6 is the only way to go. this variation is not to everyone's taste as black's king and his lack of development promise a difficult future. however, if black can solve his current problems he has an extra piece to give him hopes. in the many games that feature the text, white has won all of those in my database! the problem as we shall see is that black's queen is terribly misplaced.  (( instead of taking the knight immediately, kasparov pins the knight to the king in order to give his king a square on d8. however, many annotators have criticized this move and said that kasparov ought to have taken the knight immediately. although the black king uses two moves to reach d8 after 8...fxe6 9.bg6+ ke7, the black queen can be placed at the superior c7 square. )) (( white castles so that 9...qxe6?? loses to 10.re1 pinning and winning the black queen. black must now take the knight or he will be a pawn down. )) deep blue's operator, joe hoane was so nervous at this point - deep blue's evaluation was in its favor - that he shakily started playing 10.bc1-g6+ an illegal move. since this is not deep blue's fault the rules concerning the operator's moves are not touch move. the most incisive. the bishop is on a superb diagonal covering key squares which control the movements of both black's king and queen. other known moves include 11.c4 when black has also been swept off the board.  (( if black's bishop were on d6 instead of f8, white would not be able to play this. for the sacrificed knight, white's bishops have a stranglehold on black's position. black, having moved his king, can no longer castle, his queen is blocking his own bishop, and he has trouble getting out his pieces and making use of his extra knight. )) unfortunately for the commentators we were trying to justify kasparov's opening choice and explained that the novel move 11...b5 was prepared by garry and that all of his head shaking was his attempt for an oscar for best drama. previous games have seen 11...qb4 trying to make room for his pieces. but these games also have resulted in black losses. the purpose of the text is to secure the d5-square for a black knight when it can't be dislodged by c2-c4. a noble aim except that it simply does not work. there is no question that black faces difficulties but the computer's approach to winning the game is quite different from a human's. essentially the computer looks at each position as if it were unique. it doesn't have prejudices about previous ideas but tries to play the best move according to its evaluation and its thinking. take another look at the position before the text move. in general, it is good to win a queen for rook and bishop. a computer is correctly programmed to think that winning a queen for rook and bishop is a good thing. white can play rf1-e1 and bg6-f5 in order to win the e7-queen. also the computer likes to win pawns and could play for rf1-e1 and qd1-e2xe6 when in both cases black is relieved by the trades. if white is given the opportunity to carry out either of these operations it is definitely in black's interests to let him!  with the text, kasparov weakens his entire queenside structure and allows white to develop his a1-rook. what were his choices? well, 11...nd5 12.bg3 qf6 13.bh4 definitely fails. and no one wants to play black after 11...nd5 12.bg3 n7f6 13.ne5 when white has too many threats. in the past 11...qb4 hasn't worked so another strategy has to be found. an anti-computer strategy. kasparov facing a difficult position has to let the computer bail him out! my suggestion is to do little! black should draft his queenside into the game while trying to induce deep blue to win material. of course i can't guarantee such a strategy would work! this then is my suggestion: 11...a5!! (two exclaims for understanding the opponent is a computer.) 12.re1 (12.a4!? b6 13.c4 ba6 14.rc1 kc8 is black's basic idea given the chance he wants to play ...kc8-b7 and try to hold on.) 12...a4 13.qe2 b5 14.qxe6?! qxe6 15.rxe6 nb6 16.rxc6 nbd5 intending ...bc8-d7 when we see black's idea in full bloom. if in the above line we see the following: 11...a5 12.re1 a4 13.bf5 (as in the game) 13…exf5 14.rxe7 bxe7 black is in great shape. he is about to coordinate his pieces and he has a material advantage. these lines demonstrate how deep blue could easily go wrong. its highest priorities are to win material. in both cases deep blue is doing what it is told (don't forget, it was told to sacrifice a knight!) and winning material. if the result is that deep blue gets a bad game that is just the way it goes. the real bad news about the text is that it tells deep blue exactly what to do, open up the queenside. simple for deep blue and a powerful move. the computer tells itself that advancing pawns are good. white's a1-rook is activated without moving and that the shield around black's king is compromised by the text. all reasons enough to make this move. played without any understanding for the position. garry misses a devastating shot which finishes the game fast. he had to play 16...qb4 17.rxe6 be7 and hope. garry was busily shaking his head in disgust and looking into the few persons in the audience. he was looking towards his mother as if to say i want to resign. should i? not a happy mother's day present. (( white is pounding at black's e6 pawn and is planning to invade the position with his rooks. kasparov cannot hold onto all his extra material and desperately decides to surrender his queen for a rook and a bishop. )) (( black resigned after the next move because the white queen will soon invade through c4 or f5, and once re1 is played it will be lights out. a sample line would be: 19...bxc4 20.qxc4 nb4 (20...kb7 21.qa6 mate!) 21.re1 kd8 22.rxe7 kxe7 23.qxb4+. it was the shortest loss of kasparov's career. )) doing what computers do best, calculate tactics. as 19...bxc4 20.qxc4 kb7 21.qa6 is checkmate, kasparov was forced to realize that his whole plan of controlling the d5-square simply fails. his alternative19...nb4 20.qxf5 rf8 21.qe6 bxc4 22.ne5 is also good for white. still, kasparov's resignation was premature to say the least. i had expected kasparov to dig in his heels and fight. but he had no fighting spirit and simply gave up. following his resignation there was a sudden and complete emptiness in the spirit of the people in the auditorium. all the buildup up in tensions had been sucked out as if in a vacuum. we were all in disbelief and shock. ibm had done it. they had created a computer program that defeated the world's highest rated human. it was a watershed event and an extraordinary moment in time. kasparov seemed utterly dazed.  press conference: garry appeared in the press center shortly after the last game had finished so disastrously for him. he took his seat next to ibm team leader c.j. tan and looked grimly up into the air till it was his time to speak. monty newborn tried to introduce kasparov's team but garry stopped him: "my team doesn't need to be recognized. deep blue's team does." c.j. tan thanked garry, "a brave man to participate in this great experiment." c.j. tan continued, the computer played grandmasterly chess. where do go from here? we will continue to work with garry but perhaps on a less competitive level." garry's response: "the competition has just started." garry started off with: "i have to apologize for the performance today. the match was lost by the world champion with very good reason." garry elaborated on the loss of the match, that game two had been crucial. "it was beyond my understanding the moves deep blue played. it plays a move like be4 but misses qb6. all the print-outs of game 1 - 6 should be published. i have no idea what was happening behind the curtains. i'm ashamed i lost this match, since the machine had too many weaknesses. i want to understand how deep blue won the match. i want to look at the print-outs. the computer still has generic problems and the way to prove that this was not a single event - that the computer has a great mind, is for deep blue to enter competitive chess. make ibm a player not a sponsor." garry was asked if he was suggesting that ibm had been cheating on him. he replied: "i'm suggesting, many things happened well beyond my understanding and it should be tested on other machines to see if they show up with the same kind of answers." garry about game 6: "the best player in the world cracked down under pressure. after the computer takes on e6 (8.nxe6), i can resign. i didn't feel like playing. i'm human. what happened in the previous games was beyond my understanding and i was scared." garry won't mind to play another match against deep blue but one of the conditions he already stated is: "only when ibm is not the sponsor.

ca commence bien, je n'ai pas bossé mes ouvertures contre 1.e4 (en fait je n'ai rien bossé en ouvertures quel que soit le coup blancs). j'espère juste que le joueur ne va pas m'agresser avec un gambit blackmar-diemer. voila la fin de ma théorie. j'ai joué 2.c5 car ca m'a rapelle une partie du livre starting out modern de n. davies. et puis parce que je crois que kronx jouait 2.c5 (si un +1950 elo fide joue ca, ca doit le faire).  meme si je suis hors theorie, la position rappelle pas mal la moderne. je ne suis pas perdu finalement et en plus j'aime bien ma position. comme quoi la moderne est bien une ouverture qui fait appel a pleins d'autres ouvertures. c'est le tournant de la partie (tout au moins le premier). par contre je me suis trompe en visualisant la ligne et je vais perdre un pion. il est urgent que je travaille a fond cette capacite a visualiser. le gros bol que les blancs ne jouent cxd4 (c'etait la ligne que j'avais mal visualise et ou je m'attendais donc a perdre un pion). la je pense que ca commencer a picoter pour les blancs. j'espere que cette fois je me suis pas tromper sur la ligne. fb4 n'est pas cloue en fait grace a fe2, si la dame prend fe2 je gagne la qualite. j'avais vu aussi cet alle retour {game 608 (loopy vs. mrtoduvet) loopy  checkmated

las blancas utilizan este orden de jugadas para evitar la defensa grünfeld, de todas maneras en ese instante me daba lo mismo si entramos o no en ella, porque iba resuelto a jugar india de rey. aquí estamos en la linea en cuestión. las blancas retrasan el avance del peón en d5 o la captura y a la vez retan a las negras a perder algunos tiempos para descolocar el alfil de "e3".  entonces, estas posiciones ya no son los acostumbrados asaltos de peones en el flanco, son más abiertas. las blancas tienen presencia en "d5" y las negras en "e5". querrán golpear a "e4", pero el desarrollo del flanco de dama es un tema no menor. no estoy seguro de la corrección de la idea negra, ahora se abre la diagonal se presiona en el centro, pero... los peones doblados son de verdad. ¡y la pareja de alfiles también! ¡pésima jugada! un error de cálculo que pudo costar de inmediato la partida. al parecer mi rival no estaba en su mejor forma... 16 axd8 luego toma en c7 y d6, tocando a la torre de f8. lo más probable sería tomar en c3 y luego defender con tf6, pero es clara ventaja blanca. torres a las columnas, ¡qué más natural! sin embargo, la posición dinámicamente hablando, es fome para las negras. salvo la gran diagonal... entonces, se ve interesante 17.., ae5, con idea de dg7, tomando en cuenta que los chistes con ah6 no son tan fuertes ya que el caballo de c3 quedará tocado o bien la torre si va a c1 a defender, permitirá un af4 recuperando la calidad en todas. la partida de a poco se empieza a volcar en favor de las blancas. ahí vamos por el buen camino!, pero ahora la torre blanca está más activa momento crítico. había que seguir presionando en las casillas negras con de7. las blancas aprovechan la oportunidad ok, perdido no estoy, pero de que es incómodo, es incómodo: estructura de peones, diferencia de piezas menores, debilidad en el flanco de rey, pocas perspectivas de iniciativa. la posición de las blancas es "sanita". ahora mi ecuanimidad naugragó, como dijo karpov "ataque" en el flanco, contrajuego en el centro. las blancas están a la altura. ahora resulta que el peón que no se movería será uno de los verdugos de la posición. ahora se notará la diferencia de reyes (nótese la columna f) y la ventaja del caballo sobre el alfil. algo tengo que buscar la lucha está perdida.  
-------------------------------------
personalmente considero más activa para el negro la continuación 5.-ae3-df6/6.- c3-ce7/7.-cc2-axe3… etc e5 es quizá la mejor respuesta que tiene el blanco ya que de otro modo se cambien las damas o no, el blanco ayuda en el desarrollo del bando  enemigo. por otro lado para las negras también era interesante la continuación db6 a lo cual las blancas hubiesen contestado dxb6 para luego jugar en contra de la estructura negra en el flanco de dama este es otro motivo por el cual era mejor que las negras intentasen cambiar las damas en b6 ya que el ataque negro es bastante lento comparado con el de las blancas, las cuales llegaran por el flanco de rey muy rápidamente interesante continuación que le permite un rápido desarrollo a las negras, sin embargo las blancas deben persistir con su ataque en el flanco de rey con af5 las negras perderán un tiempo valioso, quizá era mejor intentar reaccionar con b5, si las blancas respondiesen con g4 a mi parecer es interesante para las negras jugar f5 que a primera vista es arriesgado sin embargo opino que es bastante sostenible la posición para las negras dada las circunstancias las negras debieron disminuir la presión simplificando con ce4, con el cambio las blancas pueden intentar jugar posteriormente f6, a lo cual las negras responderían probablemente g6 y llegar a una posición más estable de la que se llegará posteriormente aun era tiempo de jugar ce4 ya que con la actual respuesta de las negras dan comienzo a un fuerte ataque por parte de las blancas, la continuación que yo esperaba era 19.-f6-ce4/20.-cxe4-txe4/21.-fxg7-tae8  y las negras amenazan ingresar en la segunda fila con fuerte ataque, y las blancas ya no tienen tan fácil el acceso al flanco rey negro ya que se defiende con por ejemplo con t8e7 o dg6 dependiendo de la ocación ya es tarde,  debido a que las blancas tiene una inminente amenaza con ce7+ considero más precisa dc5, por ejemplo  21.-dh4-dc5/22.-ce7+-rh8   y las blancas deben tener cuidado ya que las negras están cambiando damas con dg5+, además en ese caso las blancas no disponen de td5 ya que perderían la partida con dxg1. por lo tanto en esa posición una mejor continuación podría haber sido, 21.-dh4-dc5/22.-ce7+-rh8/23.-g4-txe7/24.-fxe7-cd6 y aquí mi oponente perdió por tiempo 
-------------------------------------
una interesante retirada de dama, a mi parecer la más activa, ya que a diferencia de da5 o dd8 no perjudicará mayormente al desarrollo negro.  (héctor mamani) anand ha demostrado en el ajedrez de alto nivel que todas son jugables. sin embargo, sigo pensando que la defensa escandinava no plantea serios problemas al blanco. un tiempo, es un tiempo.  cg5 busca activar al caballo al mismo tiempo que se centraliza francamente no sé si f3 sea la mejor respuesta, pero en esa posición no veo como puedan ingresar las negras. pero se debe tener en cuenta una conocida frase de josé raúl capablanca la cual señala que cualquier movimiento de peón en el enroque es una debilidad. la diferencia es que a mí me gusta que me demuestren dicha frase… rolando intenta demostrarme que la última jugada f3 de las blancas fue imprudente, sin embargo las blancas disponen de recursos para sostener la posición.  (héctor mamani) pienso que, más que la diagonal g1-a7 es la h2-b8 la que se debería intentar aprovechar. tal vez ahora sería bueno que la dama estuviese en "a5" para pasar el flanco de rey. sin embargo, estoy de acuerdo en pensar que "la dama sola no gana". lo cierto es que la posición de la pieza más fuerte de las negras, aún sigue sin ser definida. (héctor mamani) tal vez c2g3, con idea de mantener defendido el alfil de "e3" con la torre, echarle un vistazo al homólogo de "e7". mi punto es que después de los cambios que vienen, el caballo en "c5" quedará clavado, entonces podría seguir: 15, c5;16 dc5, cc5; 17 cf6, af6; 18 ce4. en esta caso, supongo que 15, cd5; 16 af2 es mejor. (si 16, f5; 17 cd2 con idea de 18 cc4) las negras buscan golpear los puntos débiles de las blancas. tomando en cuenta el incompleto desarrollo se puede decir que las negras se encuentran ligeramente superiores en este punto yo esperaba que las negras jugaran ch5 la cuál considero interesante por el hecho de que la dama blanca no tiene casillas útiles, asimismo el caballo blanco situado en e2 se encuentra sobrecargado defendiendo la casilla g3. así mismo las negras amenazan jugar df2 seguido de un posible sacrificio con axf3. de haber jugado ch5 la partida podría haber continuado 20.-dc1-ch5/21.-rh2-df2/22.-dg5-axf3/23.-tf1-dxg2+/24.-dxg2-axg2/25.-rxg2            la idea es interesante, pero la variante es obviamente variable aquí entra en juego lo psicológico, antes de la partida hable con rolando y a ninguno de los 2 le convenía siquiera hacer tablas, debíamos jugar a ganar para obtener uno de los 3 primeros lugares dentro del torneo, por lo cual le ofrezco un cambio de damas repitiendo las jugadas, como ya sé que él no quiere cambiar tantas piezas lo obligaré a que sea él quien cambie la jugada y veré si puedo sacarle algún provecho ahí está. jugada lógica de parte de las negras que le permitirá a las blancas obtener contra juego en el flanco dama creo que con esta jugada las negras quedan perdidas, yo esperaba 35.-db6-txa6/36.-dxa6-dxa6/37.-axa6   y entrar en un final de alfiles donde el blanco debe presionar el flanco dama y por su parte el negro debe cuidar su flanco dama y hacer lo propio por el flanco de rey. si las negras hubiesen tomado el peón de e4 perderían ya que no logran alcanzar al peón “c” de las blancas el cual va a coronar (héctor mamani) ¡esa torre hace de todo! con el apuro de tiempo no podía resolver como ganar por el flanco dama, en ese momento me percate de la lejanía del monarca negro el cual por fuerza mayor desprotegió el flanco de rey (héctor mamani) la partida se alargó por varios movimientos más, las blancas ganaron capturando el peón de h7 con el rey y avanzando los peones propios. la torre se mantuvo en la columna "f", cortando al rey negro.  
-------------------------------------
bueno, las blancas se salieron de la línea, ahora es ajedrez puro aquí  yo esperaba que las blancas jugasen  6.-cxe5-cxe5/7.-af6-dd6/8.-axh8-f6/9.-f4-cf7/10.-e5-fxe5/11.-axe5-cxe5/12.-fxe5-dxe5  y  no siento que las negras quedasen mal ya que posteriormente el caballo se ubicara en la casilla e3  ya sea mediante el salto en d5 o f5 con bastantes molestias por el momento hay una evidente igualdad me considero un jugador  a ratos agresivo y táctico, pero la jugada g5 es quizá demasiado agresiva y descuidada. en esta ocasión fritz recomienda  13.-ce1-fxe4/14.-axe4-cd7/15.-dc1-g5/16.-f4-cf6/17.-dc2-de8/18.-db3-cxe4/19.-dxe4-exf4/20.-gxf4-cg6  con ventaja negra aunque las negras no quedaron mal era mejor 16.-axe4-cf5/17.-b4-cd7/18.-cc2-g4   con ligera ventaja negra.  en caso de 16.-axe4-cf5/17.-fxg5-ce3/18.-txf8-dxf8/19.-axe3-dxe3/20.-cg3-ad7     y la posición es absolutamente igualada según fritz el caballo  negro no hace nada, pésimamente situado, mejor era dd6 otra jugada mala por parte de ambos bandos, con rh1 las blancas ablandaron el ataque  ya que las negras deberían haber  contestado 18.-rh1-af5/19.-tg1-axe4/20.-dxe4-tf7  con juego complicado.  la jugada realizada por las negras probablemente sea la perdedora, pero la hice apresuradamente ya llegando a un tiempo restringido df5 es una jugada anti conceptual ya que la torre blanca ve con rayos x, mauricio castigo bien la imprudencia negra las blancas ganaban más rápido jugando directamente ch5  
-------------------------------------
hace mucho tiempo que quería jugar la defensa pirc en un torneo. si bien el resultado no me acompañó, no descarto para nada incluirla en mis próximas actuaciones. guillermo busca entrar en una linea que estuvimos discutiendo unas semanas antes. la idea es jugar un esquema con ac4 y df3 (?!) (obviamente, la dama saldrá de este lugar) como las negras no desarrollan acciones agresivas en las primeras jugadas, las blancas colocan las piezas para un ataque paso a paso sobre el flanco de rey. por otro lado, si ahora juego 2.., c5; guillermo puede trasponer a un ataque gran prix 3 f4.  más en el estilo de guillermo era cf3 o cualquiera que le llevara a un esquema clásico. esta jugada tiene como objetivo comenzar el llamado "spike", tanto con 5 h4, como 4 g4. una "bruta" demostración en el flanco de rey, que a veces da resultados... sobre todo en los blitz. esta linea la popularizó juan meruvia, un destacado exponente de ataque, local. también se ha jugado: 8.nh3 nbd7 9.f3 e5 10.d5 cxd5 11.nxd5 nb6 12.nxf6+ bxf6 13.o-o-o bxh3 14.rxh3 bxg5 15.hxg5 rc8 16.g4 hxg4 17.rh6 kg7 18.rdh1 rg8 19.f4 nc4 20.qd5 qc7 21.rh7+ kf8 22.bxc4 qxc4 23.qxd6+ ke8 24.qxe5+ kf8 25.c3 qxa2 26.rh8 qa1+ 27.kc2 qa4+ 28.kb1 {1-0, zimniok lubomir (cze) 2210 - zimniok zdenek (cze) 2036, karvina (czech republic) 2002 creo que mi planteamiento es "correcto", pero la falta de práctica en esta apertura, me pasa la cuenta. el contrajuego negro está demasiado atrasado, correspondía buscar el "c5" antes. las lineas me parecían claras en ese momento, pero olvidé considerar un par de respuestas 11...cxd5 12.h6 ( 12.exd5 db6 ) ae5 13.exd5 db6 se ve más consecuente con la idea de explotar la casilla "b2". la jugada de la partida tiene como idea activar las piezas en el centro, poniendo en claro la falta de desarrollo de las blancas. el tema es que la posición concretamente no dará pie para aprovechar tal situación, por lo tanto, puedo concluir que no existe tal ventaja. ahora con un f5 y el potencial mounstro de "g7" las negras deben estar mejor ¡la columna "e" ya está abierta! todas las piezas negras jugando.   
-------------------------------------
todas las jugadas realizadas hasta el momento eran conocidas, pero francamente en esta jugada olvide la continuación y opte por af4, para seguir la continuación teórica se juega  “de2”, la jugada de las negras es bastante arriesgada ya que al parecer  el cambio 2x1 no tendrá compensación alguna en este punto las blancas estan claramente major, para continuar presionando las negras debieron haber entrado en la linea 13.-rf1-dxb2 / 14.- cd2-0-0 / 15.- cf3-c5  / 16.-c4-ae6   e intentar repeler el ataque en el flanco de rey c3 es la mejor respuesta que tienen las blancas, sin embargo interesante para las negras era haber jugado 14.-c3-dg1+ / 15.-rxg1- axd1   de esta manera las blancas tienen a su monarca bastante más alejado del centro de lo que ocurrió en la partida la jugada de las negras no me gusto por el hecho de que es anti conceptual, es sabido que en los finales se debe llevar al rey hacia el centro, por ello creo que la mejor era rd7 y las blancas obtienen  el premio por el cual trabajaron, encerrar a la desolada torre negra, para sacar su torre las negras deberán entregar un peón ¿por qué las negras no jugaron c5 para luego sacar su torre?, sé que la posición negra es muy complicada, pero en estos finales una torre es una torre  
-------------------------------------
desde primeros pasos en ajedrez la jugada favorita de emilio. corto romance con 1.e4 no se convertio por el momento en algo serio. defensa eslava hace poco se incorporo en el repertorio de jorge. una eleccion muy aportuna, bastante consiste con el estilo de joven maestro.  la jugada permite evitar las magistrales variantes relacionados con captura del peon c4, impide la salida del alfil a f5 y deja la opcion de transformar la apertura en una catalana.  justamente! alfil f1 quiere en algun momento ser dueno absoluto de la diagonal h1-a8, considerando que su oponente en c8 no tiene muchas posibilidades. con clara intension de preparar el avance e2-e4 y romper el muro b7-c6-d5.  idea de las negras tambien es muy clara. pensando en el destino del alfil c8 ellas preparan el avance e6-e5. entendible mejora de torre, pero mas de moda es la jugada 9. b3 , cuando alfil blanco pretende tomar el control por el punto clave e5. es muy probable que este camino ofrece a las blancas un poco mas ambas bandas han cumplido sus objetivos. las blancas  abrieron el camino a su alfil g2, pero su contraincante c8 no quedo atras. enfrentamiento en el centro ha comenzado demasiado temprano. habitualmente esto lleva a los cambios y empate.  muy modesto. la linea magistral podria ser la siguiente: 13. ¥g5 f6 14. ¥e3 exd4 15. £xe7 ¥xe7 16. ¥xd4 estadistica de las partidas jugadas aqui es bastante favorable para las blancas, aunque rybka 3.0 no considera que ellas tienen ventaja alguna.  optando por el cambio. una alternativa muy seria podria ser 13... ¤f6 14. £c2 e4 15. ¤d2 h6 , evitando la posible clavada del caballo. las chances de las negras aqui se ven como bastante interesantes equilibrada posicion, nadie tiene debilidades y chances reales conseguir algo. por otro lado no se puede relajarse, pequenas detalles pueden tener aqui bastante importancia.  en este momento me dio impresion que jorge quiere algo mas que juego para empate. con esto no quiero decir que emilio por su lado estaba de acuerdo con el paz. los cambios tempranos sucedidos de ninguna manera reflejan el espiritu combativo de ambos maestros. el peon negro quiere llegando a a4 desarollar una presion. pero por todo hay que pagar. se siente debilidad del punto b6.  a la primera mirada se ve muy logico, se cubre la debilidad de b6, pero ahora el caballo negro esta un poco colgado y depende del alfil e6. mas fuerte se ve 19... ¥g4 , clavando a las blancas y dejando la casilla e6 libre para el caballo. fuerte movimiento! desde ahora comienza aparecer la amenaza caballo d4, con la cual las blancas obtendran la pareja de alfiles.  larga jugada, interesante maniobra. habla muy bien de creatividad de jorge, pero objetivamente es un error. se entiende que las negras querian colocar alfil a a3, poner caballo a c5 y de este modo realizar la presion al flanco de dama de las blancas. pero lamentablemente no estan tomando en cuenta amenazas de su contraincante. ??
-------------------------------------
 gravisimo error que inmediatamente lleva a la posicion perdida. habia que permitir el cambio de alfil e6 y tratar de defender la posicion un poco inferior.  muy dudosa eleccion. al parecer emilio no dio tanta importancia a la debilidad del peon b3. por supuesto simple jugada  25. ¦xb1 , permitia obtener mucho mas cambiando al defensor.  lleva a la muerte inmediata, mientras que  29... axb4 30. ¥xb4 dejaba todavia bastante espacio para la lucha sin demorrar mas que un par de segundos emilio realiza esta captura. encontrar la combinacion de este tipo nunca ha sido una tarea dificil para el.  es imposible salvarse y jorge detuvo el reloj.

 "adolf anderssen was one of the strongest players of his time, and was considered by many to be the world champion after winning the 1851 london tournament.  lionel kieseritzky lived in france much of his life, where he gave chess lessons, and played games for five francs an hour at the café de la regence in paris.  kieseritzky was well known for being able to beat lesser players despite handicapping himself - by playing without his queen, for example.
-------------------------------------
ruy lópez (a.k.a. spanish) opening. 6...b5; 7. bb3, d5 is the main line of the open variation. 7...d5 is considered too risky. 7...f5; 8. nxd4 is better for white. better than 10. kf1, qh4. 11...qxe4 is worse due to 12. nd4 ! b5; 13. kh2. julen arizmendi's suggestion after arizmendi - garcía román, cullera op 2005. 15. be3, f5; 16. nc3, ke7; 17. g4 was played at capablanca - lasker, new york 1915. 18...g6; 19. gxf5, gxf5; 20. f3 creates a weak black pawn. an error. 20...bd5 was black's best option. 22...rf7; 23. kg3, bd7 was better. white bishops are in total control of the board, now. 29. be5, rb7; 30. bxb7 , kxb7 is also o.k. 32. ne6! heading to d4 was even better. 37. ng7?? re2 equalizes. the final is still far from won for white. how to continue? after 40. rd1, f3 ; 41. kg1, rd5 or 40. kf1, f3; 41. rd2, ra5, white is not making any progress. 40. f3!! the only way to break black's compact mass of pawns. 43. rg2, rh2 ; 44. rg1, rxb2; 45. rd1, rxa2 gives black some compensation. only move! now, the pawn at g2 will fall, and white will win the rook ending. 63...kf6; 64. ke4 was also hopeless for black. 64. kg5! was more accurate. here, on oct 8th, 2007, rolando resigned. 
-------------------------------------
another options are 3. nd2 (tarrasch) and 3. e5 (nimzowitsch). my latvian opponent had previously played 3...nf6; 4. bg5, be7; 5. e5, nfd7; 6. h4!? c5; 7. bxe7, kxe7. another possibility is 3...bb4 (winawer). the main line is 5. nf3. 9. nf3 is played more often. 9. bg5!? qa5 ; 10. bd2, qc7; 11. 0-0-0, 0-0 was seen at polgar - ehlvest, vienna 1996. better was 9...h6, 10. bb5 , bd7; 11. bxd7 , qxd7; 12. bxf6, gxf6; 13. rd1, qc6 as in fedorov - van wely, istambul ol 2000. 10...bd7; 11. nf3 weeks - de andrés, hamburg 2005. 11. bc3, qg5 . 11...e5 is definitely safer. white has ample compensation for the pawns. 13...be7; 14. rdf1, qc5; 15. qg3 and white has a strong attack, khalifman - bareev, corus wijk aan zee 2002. here it comes! finkel recommends 14...kh8; 15. qg3, nf6, but white is still up after 16. bd3! protecting h6... 17. bc3 was played by anand against van wely in 2001. 18...qc5?? 19. qh6 1-0 morozevich - van wely, corus wijk aan zee, 26.1.2002. no easy life is expecting black, anyway... of course! the key move! 20. nd2! intends rf3, heading to f7. the queen is not allowed to abandon the f file. 20...kf8; 21. rf3, nf6; 22. qh8 , ke7; 23. qxd8 , kxd8; 24. rxf4 was black's best option... unsufficient to equalize, however. according to plan! 21...qf5; 22. rxf5, exf5; 23. qxf5, nf8; 24. qf2 was not enough, either. the attack has not vanished, yet! 26...ba6; 27. h5 was the other way to die. necessary. if 35. qc7?? rd1#. black will be mated at h8. 
-------------------------------------
he brings out his pawns early i guess making it harder for my knights to advance. if he were to castle from here, it wouldn't look especially pretty, but the king will never get that  far anyway.  advantage me! ... but i will lose it somehow... yup, this is where i lost it. (the advantage, not the game.) maybe i should have  taken the bishop here...but i think my king's position would  have been worse... given the circumstances, a decent trap. it occurred to  me too late that moving the  other rook to c8 would have looked less obvious, but no use complaining since he did take the bait.   (but left me wondering all afternoon/night before he finally did so.[in retrospect this "trap" may have killed me. don't try this at home, kiddies.])  i guess he never saw it coming. bam! you know you in trouble now! oh  no you di-in't put your lady in my lady's face! but i didn't come alone! i got friends!  my kingdom for a horse! he says, but his horse can't even help him! he's hopeless! yup he runnin' for it now. all runnin' in circles around his lady lookin' silly. and i  am back in the game. i am offering draws at this point,  and being met with only mockery. but i think this game will end in a draw, and  i sir, shall have the last laugh.  ....................................................................................  wichti: well, u lost, didn´t u? ....................................................................................  nobody likes a know-it-all,  wichti. yeah, i did lose it in the end, whilst enduring some merciless mockery from my opponent, who basically profited from some very sloppy moves on my part. personally, i don't think someone who titles a game "in a mad world only the mad are sane" should be allowed to mock other people, but that's just my opinion.  i can only be comforted by the fact that my opponent was too cowardly and classless to grant me a rematch. 
-------------------------------------
the larsen's opening. i think this was the second time i ever played vs this opening, which is kinda odd considering it's the 6th most popular opening move. larsen himself thought that b3 is an opening in which most black players make a mistake somewhere, since they aren't familiar with the ideas behind the opening. he was more or less right, i didn't know and still don't know these ideas, hence why i'm analysing this game in the first place. i expected her to play the london system and prepared for that specific opening the night before, so i was a little bit baffled about b3, which invites a completely different kind of position. universally speaking the most played response. it blocks off the diagonal and takes a hold of the center.  still the main line and the most logical move in my opinion. unfamiliar with the opening i was calculating d4 here, but couldn't see how that'd benefit white so i disregarded it. i should have thought a little longer about this move, even if it's just to familiarize myself with the ideas of the opening. taking a hold of the center. and so it begins. black has got to be a little careful here. usually a move like bd7 would work fine, however because his bishop on b2 is attacking e5, the only really thing black can do is to defend e5. white usually tries to hold onto this pin for a little while, however i researched my opponent a little bit before the match and knew she had a tendency to just take in these type of positions.   theory suggests that 4.bb5 bd6 5.c4 is the logical continuation after 4. bb5. i opt for f6 instead. this move may look insignificant, but means a huge deal since it closes off a diagonal for my queen and makes nf6 impossible for the time being. also interesting to note is that after d4 all my pawns would be positioned on dark squares, which weakens his bishop on b2, but makes it hard for my own dark squared bishop to develop properly. this last part will become a huge issue later on.   as predicted she couldn't resist taking. black has a frightening center now and ideas arise along the lines of rb1 -> rb4  and then bringing it over to the king side. that idea of course isn't useful just yet, but it's definitely there. i think black is better here and if black develops normally from this point onwards he'll have a very good game. developing a knight to a rather poor square. nf3 isn't really an option though since 6. nf3 e4 makes white's position a tad cramped. this move took me quite long and quite frankly i think bf5 is better, targeting the weak c2 square. looking back at it, i'm not sure why that wasn't played. i assumed she was going to castle king-side, which is premature in my opinion. she did end up castling, which i think is an error. now the knight on e2 is in a spot where it can't move to g3. this move and the following ones are the reason why i'm not too proud of this game. the idea behind c5 can be explained with 3 short sentences.: i have doubled pawns. i don't like double pawns. can we get rid of them? i figured i'd push with d4 and get in a position where white is cramped and struggling to develop her minor pieces.  this however makes things awkward for my dark squared bishop. i wonder what i would play if i could replay this game, probably something like bc5 or nd7. making room for the knight to develop to d2. i understand this move, but it feels sort of tame. i probably would have played f4 if i were in white's shoes. after 8. exf4 rxf4 9. bd6 rf2 white gets out of the pin and can create some sort of counter play. she'll still have a very tough game, but it offers better chances in my opinion than 8. d3. if black doesn't take on f4 then after for example 8. f4 ne7 9. fxe5 fxe5 10. d3 white has a pretty solid position with an open f-file. in that position black would probably still be better, but white would barely have any big weaknesses which black can exploit whereas black's position is aggressive but vulnerable on e5, c5,c7  the e8-h5 diagonal, etc. you can probably tell by now that my dark squared bishop isn't going to play a huge role in the next few moves. at this point i started calculating f4. my opponent afterwards asked me what move she should have played and when i explained her my f4 idea she admitted to not noticing that idea. f4 is going to play a major role in all my future calculations. black has more space, but f4 is a serious issue and black's white squared bishop is looking rather odd. i start to get a little nervous at this point, but decide to not show a worried face to my opponent. instead i leave the room to tempt her to make her move more quickly. you often see lower rated players do this to win a couple of minutes. up until this point i had spend about 20-25 minutes whereas she had used 15 minutes. by leaving my board i essentially tempt her in getting a 15 minute advantage in the hope that she doesn't think of f4. when i came back 5 minutes later i noticed 4 more minutes missing on my clock and c3 being played. i took a sip of my drink ( which i ended up getting in the time i left my board ) and leisurely looked at the board. my worst nightmare, f4, wasn't played and it looked like i was going to get a pawn for free. life was good. losing a bit of my pressure, but making a move like f4 less uncomfortable. white also can't prevent black from winning material. she sighed as she realised she messed up. the following move strangely enough took her 5 minutes or so. after the game she told me that she was unsure of which piece she'd recapture with. the most logical recapture in my opinion. notice how her minor pieces are developed whereas most of my pieces are still on the 8th rank. bxd3 was the other option. both are fine in my opinion. i opted for a queen trade since i was 1 pawn ahead. it may seem like a premature decision, but surely i should be able to win an endgame against a usually weaker opposition right? this move just straight up loses. she should have played rf1e1 or rf1d1 in my opinion. this just makes the position very awkward for white. the knight can't move, the open files aren't used, etc.   editing note: looking back at this game once more, my assesment of the position before this move is that black is up, but not by much. the reason being because he's underdevelopped and one could argue that it's worth the pawn. in this position ideas of f4 arise once more. white should aim to open up the game and gives checks all across the board rather then bunker up. rae1 is a mistake and instead rfd1 or rad1 should have been played after which i continue rd8 or o-o-o. maybe then ng3 or f4, or something, but the move that was played. this move is to prevent f4 once more. reason being that the rook on e1 makes f4 an even bigger nuisance. let's say that i make a random move like h6. 13. rae1 h6 14. f4 exf5 and white has 2 rooks aiming at the king and 2 knights ready to give checks everywhere. black should move cautious because there's definite attacking chances for white in that position.  or 13. rae1 h6 14. f4 rd1 15. fxe5 fxe5 16. with the same issues. white can probably spare a tempo in that position to get out of the pin and will start aiming with all his pieces towards my king. the pawn on e5 would most likely fall somewhere along the line and one could even go as far as saying white is better in that position. of course that is implying that i lose 1 or more tempo by making unnecessary moves, but you get the idea. the threat is definitely there in the future. aiming at c7 which forks king and rook. this would probably work in a blitz game, but with still more then an hour on the clock? not likely. rc8 might have been slightly better, since now white can get out of the pin by taking the bishop and employ the f4 idea. this is where she noticed the f4 idea. a tad late, but at least she noticed. the next move is going to take me a while. i'm tired of having to calculate f4 every move so i decide to get out of the pin. f4 is still playable, but my knight ( which hasn't moved all game, the poor thing ) defends the important e7 square thus making an attack rather unlikely to succeed. not too sure what she's trying here. if i had to take a guess she's grasping at straws here to try and create some kind of counterplay before she unleashes f4, maybe hoping i'll develop my knight so the e7 square isn't protected anymore. attacking the knight, forcing her to either retreat or take my bishop. cxb is better then axb in my opinion, it makes the 2 pawns less vulnerable. moving out of the pin. it took me 18 moves, but i think i can consider myself fully developed now. i pat myself on the back for a job well done. ne7 is slightly better than nh6 in my opinion, because although both moves move towards the d4 square, after ne7 -> nc6 white can't play b4. b4 isn't a big threat per sé, but i'm the type of player that likes to kill all counter play before finishing off a game. attacking said knight. the only response i can muster to this move is: meh.  it's not really an amazing plan, but a plan is a plan i suppose. looking to place my knight on d4 with tempo after trading my bishop for her knight. completely destroying any prospects of f4 and preparing myself to march my extra pawn to the first rank in the future. mistakes were made. she didn't realize that my bishop can just take her knight. this sequence pins her 2 pawns, which she can't protect. my knight is a monster knight on d4. a tad too late, but she found the move which haunted me this game. no reason not to take. creating a square for her king to move to. this move attacks the bishop, thus she must retreat it. after her retreat i planned on pursuing it aggressively in an attempt to get my rook on the 2nd of 3th rank. bc1 isn't exactly what i expected, but i suppose she wanted to recapture on f4. nd4 aims for ne2 while also attacking b3. most people would resign here. and at this moment she realized it was more or less hopeless. her next move adds salt on the wound. the only move that didn't lose material was rd1, but it'd cost her her bishop and gives black an easy game. she resigned. all in all i ended up winning and the chess team i play in even ended up winning its first team victory ( with a score of 3-1) of the season. that being said, this game was full with inaccuracies. if white had played f4 sooner then black would have had a hard game for sure. i also don't like that i wasn't able to exploit her weaknesses, though that in itself is interesting to analyse. 2 weeks ago i won versus a 1600 elo player, this week i struggled against someone easily 400-500 points weaker. it not only proves that i still got a long way to go, but perhaps also emphasizes one of the best parts about chess, the part in which it's a game and no outcome is certain.

the starting moves of the italian game. so far, very standard. not a mistake, but definitely less popular than c3. good, better to maintain the tension than to exchange right away. the pin is very useful later. ?! i hate to criticize this move, because it is 100% consistent with basic opening principles. nc3 is not really a bad move per se, but it is unambitious and leads to a potentially dull and boring game.  more promising options would be c3, aiming for either b4 or d4, castling to leave options open, or h3, preventing white's next move. the game is now almost entirely symmetrical. often symmetry works out poorly for black, who is behind by a half-move, but in a position as locked up as this one, it will be hard for white to make any play without taking some risks. this is an excellent square for the knight, and it takes advantage of the annoying pin on black's f6-knight.  ?! this is carrying the symmetry too far. black might have tried ...g5 10. nxf6+ qxf6 11. bg3 0-0-0 instead, getting the king to safety on the queenside. white strikes first. ! and now, black is denied the same opportunity. white has inflicted a weakness on the kingside and has gained space there as well. on the other hand, the kingside will no longer be a safe space for the white king, so white needs to put some serious thought into the king's future. in the actual game, white delayed figuring out the king's situation so long that it became a real problem. !? on one hand, this move is admirable for how it restricts black's pieces and kicks the black knight out of d4. on the other hand, it leaves behind some problems for white: 1) the knight was the only white piece who could really take advantage of all those nice squares on the kingside (f5, h5) and in the center (e3, d5), and 2) white will probably want to castle queenside, so this weakens the king's future home.  a different plan would be to play bg3, so that either black plays nxf3+ of his own volition, or you get to play nh4, threatening both nxg6 and nf5. ?! now that white has committed to c3 in order to restrict this knight, black should have traded it off. ? ooooh.... yes, this move is a very worthwhile goal. but the white pieces just aren't ready for it. the queen needs to develop, the king needs to castle, and there needs to be adequate support for both center pawns. as it is, this move just loses a pawn and hands black the initiative. ? wishful thinking. now both center pawns hang.  defending the e-pawn with, say, d5 and bd3 (bd3 right away loses the d-pawn) should have been the priority.  ! cool, calm and collected. black takes a move to secure his king, knowing that white cannot defend his center pawns. ? undefends one pawn to defend another. 0-0-0 would have been better. d5? would have been met by ...na5. ? at this point, during the next few moves we see a familiar pattern: one player makes a mistake, then the other player, after taking a big advantage, doesn't know what to do with it and drifts aimlessly. meanwhile, the first player (white here), newly motivated by his/her mistake, plays with renewed focus and gradually takes over the initiative. ? i assume that white was short of time, since this move does nothing to help the attack. what about either moving the rook on h1, or getting the queen out of the dark-squared bishop's way? ?! courageously giving up more material to eliminate black's best piece. but it would have been much better to play qc3 and then bxd4+, trading a bishop for the knight instead of giving up a rook for it. ! good, using all of the pieces. black should not go grabbing pawns in front of his king right now. instead, he should focus on using the material he already has to take the fight to the insecure white king which is stuck in the center  – …rc8 or …qc7 come to mind. ? ditto for white – this is not the time to go grabbing wing pawns. white is too far behind in material to be able to make up for it with this kind of queen sortie. all this does is a) open lines to the white king after …ra8, and b) take the queen out of the action. instead, moves like qf6 or qg3 – attacking the bishop (notice that the f7-pawn is pinned?) and freeing d4 for the white bishop – should have been under consideration. ? missing white's next – forcing it, in fact. black should have noticed how short of squares his queen was. now was the time to free the queen with …qf4. ! an excellent idea, which forces a major concession from black (hiding the queen away on h7) if he wants to avoid a draw by repetition.  the black queen cannot avoid harassment without completely removing herself from the action. taking the repetition with …qh6 would have been hard to do in view of black's being up the exchange (i.e. rook for bishop), but it would have avoided the loss. white's pieces are now too active compared to black's, and black needed to get real about his chances. another consequence of qxa7? is that the queen and bishop now get in each other's way. still, instead of this little step, the queen should have gone all the way to e7, threatening to move to f6 next turn, at which point black would be completely tied up. ? thinking to take advantage of the fact that be3 is no longer an option, but it gives white the opportunity to play… !! this move! an excellent combination, not at all easy to see – especially with your clock ticking down. it is very impressive that white, despite the time pressure and the psychological effect of being behind for so long, was able to spot this tactic. the bishop on g6 is pinned, and the rook on f8 is overloaded. (i.e. it's trying to guard too many pieces at once.) white is only up one pawn for now, but he has not given up any of his piece activity and his position is crushing. black now decides to end things quickly. ?? …rf8 would have held out longer, of course. then 37. qe6+ kh7 38. qxd6 (threatening 39. rxg6 qxg6 40. qxf8, among other things) would have kept white firmly on the path to a quick victory. as it is, white does not miss this chance to end things quickly and cleanly, before any more mistakes can happen on either side.  congratulations on your fighting victory! the game wasn't always pretty, but it was scrappy and plenty exciting. 
-------------------------------------
philidor's defense.  this move isn't exactly bad, but i don't recommend it unless you know exactly what you're doing. black would be better off defending the pawn while developing a piece (…nc6, …nf6). ? way too slow. white also should be developing his pieces. !? interesting. this grabs a big share of the center, but again i think black would be better off developing pieces. ! a good plan: preparing to blow the center open. ?! black now develops a piece, but not the right one or to the right square. …nf6 would be more to the point: it gets black one step closer to castling and attacks the e-pawn. also, the lsb (light-squared bishop) is better placed on e6, not d7. development is good, but should be planned out and not done randomly. ! again, white has exactly the right idea: to open the center and then punish black's slow development. white's pieces will be able to develop rapidly once the black pawns are weakened. good, now black is catching up. …nf6 is still better for the reasons stated in black's last move. ? too much! white cannot attack with just one knight. bc4 was just crying out to be played. ? this developing move is too late. …be7 is better, attacking the knight and leaving the defensive move …nh6 open. ?? this is the logical follow-up to white's play, but it just loses a piece. again, you can't attack with just one piece! bc4 was again obvious, natural and good. black would have no good way to defend the f-pawn.  now this move comes… two moves too late. where is white's attack? black has the extra material and the lead in development. ! good, clearing some tension in the center to reduce complications. ?! pointless checks are pointless. finally getting some more pieces involved. with a cheapo threat. !? a very tricky way to defend, giving back a single pawn to exchange off white's last aggressive piece. good eye! ! forcing exchanges. now it is black who attacks. i like how you didn't get stuck in defensive mode and seized your chance to end it quickly. ! things don't look good for white… ! white seizes on every chance for counterplay, but it's not enough. ! rather than defending, black wraps things up with a nice attack before anything strange can happen on the e-file. the worst of a set of bad options. ! no way black was letting that one go. excellent counterattacking. 
-------------------------------------
again, e4 (the king's pawn opening) and b3 (the nimzovich-larsen attack) are both reasonable moves on their own, but they don't go well together. with e4 you started occupying the center and you ought to develop quickly while supporting you foothold in the center or attacking black's – nf3, nc3, f4, d4 and bc4 are all better moves. white does well to claim a greater share of the center. normally i would tell you to develop your other minor pieces and castle before making this move, but in this case nc3/d2 would remove a supporter of d4, while bc4/b5 would allow black to hit back with …nf6. ?! tension, tension. there is no need to make this trade unforced. why not apply more pressure to the knight first, with bb5?  ?! now is the time for development, not for making pawn thrusts on the wings. this move does nothing to aid your development, weakens your pawn structure (we haven't gone over what that means yet, i know), and just forces the black bishop to go to a better square. this move is fine, but …rb8 would have been a fancy way to develop a piece while indirectly protecting the bishop. ! releasing the dsb (dark-squared bishop) with a gain of time (the threat against g7). still, why did you have to play b4 first? ? preventing the "threat" of c5, which would have just lost a pawn anyways. black desperately needed to play …nf6. now white wins a whole rook. ! good eye for those diagonals! ! not getting complacent. white develops while hitting the pesky advanced knight and clearing the way for castling. better than retreating. ? instead of opening lines to his own king, black should develop the bishop on c8. a dangerous pin. ! preventing f3 and threatening bxf2+. eliminating the threat. ! getting the last pieces into the fight. (qd5!? also deserved a look, but i'm glad you chose to develop.) ! making some play out of the doomed e-pawn. ?? ouch! the pawn isn't really pinned! gotta stay sharp, even when winning. ?? one good turn deserves another. …exf2+! (yes, it's check!) 20. kf2 fxe1=q+ 21. rxe1 rb8 and white is in big trouble. black should have won the game here, but missed his chance. to your credit, you didn't give him another. good job picking up that extra pawn before trading queens. white is playing with purpose: the white pieces are increasingly encircling the black king's position. an unnecessary exchange; it'd be better to get the last rook involved. still, i can't blame you for trading while ahead. squeezing black more and more. ! here's your trump. black, huddled up in one quarter of the board, now has to figure out a way to stop the pawn or perish. good, no need to miss necessary defensive moves. ?? and black makes a final huge mistake under the pressure. ! curtains! good eye. 
-------------------------------------
hi everyone!  this game will be categorised under the heading "king in the centre".  henry does get caught in the centre after an exchange of queens but unlike king myrridin, henry does not become involved in tactical shots based around him and in this game he manages to hold my position together like glue - just like his absent spouse glenda tended to do.  it is not often now that i give away the result of the game at its commencement but i would like you read on just to find out how only my 4th draw in 37 games against the coach came about. 1. …. nf6 - after starting with the reti, coach ion replies by bringing out his own knight. 2. c4 - kind of transposes into an english opening. 3. nc3 - out comes sir lollabout! 5. qa4+ - and out comes glenda! 6. qxc4 - who zaps ion's pawn on c4 to regain material parity. 7. …… a5 - pawn roll. 8. e4 - i counter in the centre with a pawn roll of my own. 9. …. bb7?! - ga marks this down as an inaccuracy.  difficult to see what is wrong with the move though. 11. …… nd5 - a black horsie now makes d5 a permanent residence. 12. ….. qxe7 - bishop trade. 13. nc5 - i find an outpost of my own. 14. ….. qxb7 - n for b trade.  i did not like the possibility of ion's lsb landing on a6 so i thought i would trade it off. 16. bg2 - only one move away from castling.  this does not happen because ion offers me a queen trade.  i think very carefully before i accept it because if i do then there is a possibility of a black rook invasion down the c column later down the line. 17. ……. cxb5 - ion does saddle himself with doubled pawns after this trade though but unfortunately i was unable to exploit this. 19. kd2! this move prevents a rook invasion on c2 and as there are not so many pieces on the board and the rooks will soon be traded off, the centre becomes the right place for a king. 20. rc2 - prepare to double! 22. kd2 - one pair of rooks is traded off and henry just shuffles back to d2 to allow my remaining rook to come to c1. 22. ….. a4 - looks strong but it does make ion's b pawns potential targets later on. 24. kxc1 - the final pair of rooks are traded off and we now have a two piece endgame.  in my jo against the titans mt part 5, this game is now offering me the best chance of avoiding nul point as in my other games against the 3 daves, dynamic dave, dave patron and dave rundle (all who had ratings of over 2400!) i have had to deal with being canned in the middlegame.  i also lost my game with the black pieces against ion so it was great to reach a position like this against the coach who, in this game was due to reach the dizzy heights of masterdom! 24. …… nac7 - ion's knights each back up a b pawn. 26. nd3 - putting pressure on b4. 27. gxf6 - pawn trade. 29. f4 - to widen fou leblanc's scope. 29. …… kd6 - king ion makes for my iqp but fou leblanc will not allow him to land on d5.  so long as fou leblanc keeps on that diagonal this vulnerable pawn is safe. 30. bf3 - followed by draw offer which ion accepts.  this ensured that i signed off that mt with un demi point and my sixth master draw.  coach ion felt i had the better of it and ga gave me a plus score of 0.54.  ga also could not detect any errors in my game so an error free game against the coach is a miracle in itself! i, however, was a little worried about that aforementioned iqp and i felt tied down to defending it, although i was also putting pressure on ion's queenside pawns by means of sir slugabout.  so i can only conclude that this iqp weakness has prevented me from cooking coach ion's xmas turkey and has saved his bacon and possibly the chipolatas that go with it! 
-------------------------------------
esta movida coloca a las negras en una situación defensiva inmediatamente.  mejor es el contragolpe central mediante 3...d5!  dudosa. las negras deberían haber atendido la amenaza posicional de doblarles los peones. sin duda 5...ad7 era mucho mejor.  el negro está obligado a realizar este cambio, ya que si retira el alfil de la diagonal d1-h5 pierden peón después de fxe5 y cxe5. tampoco es posible 7...ah5 por 8.g4 ag6 9.f5 perdiendo pieza.  tras esta jugada las negras quedan peor de lo que ya estaban, puesto que sus peones doblados en la columna "c" ahora quedarán aislados.  era mejor para las negras 8...exf4 9.dxf4 ch5 10.df2 ae7 11.0-0 y las blancas están algo mejor, pero aún hay mucha partida por delante.  buena jugada  las negras defienden el peón de e5 antes de enrocar.  no vale 11...0-0 por 12.dg3 y las negras perderían peón ante las amenazas de dxe5 y axh6  el caballo por d1 se puede dirigir a las casillas "c4" o "f5", dependiendo de lo que haga el negro.  es lógico que el pequeño maestro quiera atacar, pero esta movida tiene poco concepto al dejar un feo agujero en "f5".  fuerte jugada. amenazando dejarle los peones aún más feos de lo que ya están.  es mejor 14...dxf5 aunque el blanco sigue con mucha ventaja después de: 15.txf5 cd7 16.ce3  desde el punto de vista estratégico esta partida ya está ganada para el blanco. el plan a seguir será colocar las piezas atacando las debilidades, en este caso el peón de "e5", lo que obligará al negro a colocar las suyas en situación pasiva. este es un procedimiento típico cuando se busca ventaja contra los peones doblados.  no vale 20..af6 por 21.txf6 txf6 22.cxe5+ cxe5 23.axe5 thf8 24.axf6 txf6 25.rg1 con idea de cambiar torres mediante tf1 y el final sería un paseo para las blancas.  con idea de rg2 y jugar el final sin las torres.  no ayudaba ho 22...h4 23.txf8 txf8 24.tf1 txf1 25.rxf1 hxg3 26.rg2 y la ventaja del blanco es decisiva por la entrada del rey.  cae un peón y las ventajas posicionales del blanco se mantienen. el resto de la partida no requiere muchos comentarios.  !el rey se dirige a capturar el peón de c5!  y ante la amenaza imparable de rc4 las negras se rindieron. esta partida me gustó mucho por su simplicidad y forma de aprovechar las ventajas obtenidas.  
-------------------------------------
i've never seen this before. i wonder if he's preparing for g5 or he's worried about me playing bg5. i was just reached the standard position for white in the king indian's attack. i usually don't fianchetto both bishops -- probably because i read an opening book once that derided the double fianchetto as "flashy," and it's been hard to overcome that prejudice. i played this move way too automatically. e5 comes out better for me! after 10. … bxe5; 11. bxe5 qxe5; 12. nxe5 bxe1; 13. rxe1, i've gotten a q+2b for a q+b+p. i didn't expect him to release the tension this quickly. but maybe he was real concerned about me playing e5. here's a tough question: take back with the pawn or knight. either way, i probably end up with a pawn on e4. this way, there won't be a knight attacking it. plus, i've got my minor pieces all developed and i'm castled, and he still is uncastled and has a knight on b8. i decided to trade off one of his developed pieces. i was about to play dxe4 without much thought, but i decided this gives him fewer choices. he has to castle. then i'll play qg4 and see how he can deal with the threat on g7. if he plays e5, i'll challenge it with d4. i decided to trade off more pieces and head to an ending. i just taught the kids when is a bishop in the ending better than a knight: when there are pawns on both sides of the board and the center is open. so i'll try it out. i don't intend to let the pawn on d4 become a target; i'll play c4 and then d5 to trade off the center pawns. i'm sticking to the plan of creating a better endgame for me. i just taught them a couple of weeks ago that bishops are better than knights when there are pawn islands on both sides of the board and the center is open. now, i'm thinking that i can also trade pawns and he'll end up with an isolated king's pawn. another thing i taught them is that it's better to have fewer pawn islands. i spent lots of time looking at the variations after  24. rxe8   rxe8 25. rd1 then just as i was about to move it, i realized that he did lots better with nxe8. i can't push the d-pawn, and i can't send my rook to c7. so i found this plan b. but i like it because i need to make a move eventually to let my king out. but i don't think he'll take me, because it would un-isolate my qp. i'm trying to make that passed pawn. i've got a trap in mind. actually, there are lots of traps he might have to deal with because i can move the pawn and check the king. it makes sense. he figures he can attack the pawn three times, and i can only guard it one time -- i won't get my king there fast enough. but i have a plan. here's one of the traps he has to worry about. nd3 is really his only option, and i'm thinking of moving rc7. that'll let me play e7 with check, still guarded by the rook, and i can attack his queenside pawns.   and if he takes the pawn, then his knight is pinned, and i have a second pin ready with rc8 that leads to a fork. i made my last move while i saw he was online, and he took back immediately. i wonder if he hadn't been online if he would've given it more time and seen the trap. now i'm going to win the knight, and this looks like an easy endgame. he's hoping i'll take the knight first.  
-------------------------------------
is this rook sac really sound? in this game my opponent sacrificed a rook early on. although black seems to not have enough compensation, i was unable to find a way to consolidate and lost quickly. has anyone seen this sacrifice before? also - where did i go wrong? the post-match computer analysis doesn't record any mistake by me until the last few moves, when it is clearly lost for me - although it claims - perhaps wrongly - that the sacrifice was a mistake. your comments would be most welcome! so black defends against my queen's pawn with the indian defences i continue with the most commonly played move black shows an indication to play the king's indian or grunfeld defence and i continue with the most commonly played move. and black plays the grunfeld this is a quirky, rarely played move. someone played it as white against me. in the first game i met it, i lost, and i adopted it for a while, and enjoyed some successes with it. i am not sure that i would still play it against an equally rated opponent. my opponent was then rated about 1600, and i played it in a "give him a chance" frame of mind. perhaps my lose can be traced to this move? this is the best reply, which has scored well for black. pxd5 seems to transpose into the normal exchange variation of the grunfeld, where f3 is not normally played. dxc5 scores better in the gameknot opening databases. d4 is the only move in the database and in the same way nb5 is the only move in the database white won both the games on the database when black played the alternative e5, although i am not convinced that e5 is not playable. again e3 is the only move on the database. there is one game with pxe3 on the database, but white won it. e5 is the only other move on the database. again, the only move on the world database of gameknot. white won both the games with exd4 now there are two games in the database with this position. pomes marcet, j… (2390) vs. martinez, a. (2220) continued with be7 and a draw. nestorovic, dej… (2424) vs. misailovic, neb… (2335) continued with bxc5 10. nxd4 exd4 11. bd3 and black eventually won. but i thought "hang on, if he takes on c5 i can just win the rook on a8".
-------------------------------------
so far, all pretty normal for a london. black can do two things: c5, and get countergame on the queenside, or try to castle queenside, instead. black didn't make the mistake of nc6 before c5, but castled kingside. this makes it a perfect target for me. it would be exaggerated to say that white has an edge, but black has to play with more care that it seems.  ? just one carelessly slow move. probably it has a plan of b5-bb7, but...  here it comes. cesar crossed the rubicone.  almost useless move. the nd5 can't be taken by the other n. nb4 is hardly an annoyance. black plans to answer nd7 to g5? nd7 forces me to find a way to proceed, and i have plenty of them, but it would be hard to find a definitive winning one. but black preferred... my nd2 has only one scope in this opening: to be exchanged with this black n.  black is helping, but not all is still done. this move threatens him a pawn. but, more than that, is x-raying h7.  ?? the losing mistake. f5 was needed, or even qh4, and the fight continues.  but now, nothing can save black.  a piece is lost... or more.  opening a square for his n to retire, but... if now black plays 15... f6, 16... bxn. bxh6 is threatened, so fxb seems the only reasonable option. after it, 17. ng5 seems to offer white with nxh6, winning, for example: be7, 18. nxh6+, gxn, 19. qg6+! and mate on h7 the next move.  bxn, dxb, ne7 was another idea.  the unconfortable bd6 pays the price of his outcome (it could have been in e7, and black would stand a little better).  ok now. playing against a 1900+ deserves something more interesting than the boring qxh6.  coup de grâce.  and black resigns. it's not only hanging two minor pieces with almost no action, but he's facing a dreadful discovered check after bxn. a good lesson about how very slight careless moves can lead you right into the hell against a london :-d 
-------------------------------------
no me gusta cf3 de las blancas, por cuanto quedara la estructura de peones en el flanco rey (fs) mucho mejor era ad6 ya que las blancas tienen recursos para eliminar el alfil negro el cual era mejor mantener (fs) mientras más centralizados estén los caballos mejor, es una impresición negra, te8 era jugable en esta posición aquí la máquina indica una igualdad absoluta, claro que a mi gusto era mejor para las negras reaccionar con c5 (fs) imprecisión blanca, td3 era mejor, las blancas hubiesen mantenido ligera vetaja nuevamente igualdad total nadie sabe para quien trabaja, g6 por parte de las negras continuaba la igualdad, cb6 retorna a las blancas a la ligera ventaja ¿por qué las blancas no jugaron la ganadora txg7?, es debido a que yo habia dejado de anotar las jugadas varios movimientos antes, segui anotando la partida cuando ésta ya culminó, estábamos con unos 2 minutos cada uno y el tiempo apremia para cometer errores; resumiendo, alfredo no tomó el peón g7, a mi juicio se llegó a un final de tablas, el cual perdieron las negras por una imprecisión fatal cuando ya quedaban pocos segundos, eso sumado a la poca motivación de las tablas  tomando en cuenta que las tablas no le servian a ninguno como para encabezar los primeros lugares del torneo. sin mencionar mi confianza en las tablas debido a que alfredo nunca me habia ganado, como sea, !felicidades al merecido campeón del lv open jaque mate! 
-------------------------------------
esto me huele a estudios con tio johan considero mejor para el negro ah4 considero mejor f6 debido a que c6 automáticamente da un tema a las blancas a tratar, el punto d6 parece que rolando no se a percatado de que tengo un caballo... aqui se acordaron las tablas, claro que ocurrió algo curioso, le mencione a rolando lo que estaba a punto de jugar lo cual era 22.-txd8-axd8  23.- cd6-db8  24.-ce8-a6( recomendacion de fritz) 25.- cf6+-rg7  rolando dijo que no hubiese tomado el caballo, y hubiera jugado rg7 a lo cual la maquina comenzaba a aplastar a las negras con la variante obvia 26.-dg3-axf6   27.-exf6- rxf6  28.-dh4+-rg7  29.- ad2-f6  30.-ac3....      eso demuestra que antes de un ofrecimiento de tablas se debe mirar detenidamente el tablero, siempre puede haber algo escondido fuera de la vista superficial.  
-------------------------------------
nada que decir de la apertura, es todo conocido a consideración era cb5 de las blancas en vez de dd2 se acabo el librito  las blancas ya miran puntos vulnerables en h7 y deben intentar explotarlos, para ello deben abrir paso para que juegue su alfil las blancas intentan fiel a su estilo, aplastar rápido, sin embargo las negras tienen un recurso bueno para contrarrestar dicho ataque.  el recurso del cual disponian las negras y que yo por decirlo de alguna manera "mire a huevo" era 14.-ce2-dd5  15.-tf1-dxa2...... complicando la partida y quedando definitivamente superiores, las sutilezas hacen la diferencia mejor era que las blancas hubiesen jugado cfxd aqui la maquina dice que es ventaja ganadora para el blanco desesperación  
-------------------------------------
aqui eu acho que ele errou... rocar vai me dar a vitória... ele armou uma jogada interessante....mas vou fazer uma armadilha para ele. se ele achar q eu joguei errado e imaginar q ganhou cavalo e uma torre....ganhei o jogo com mate em dois ... hummm.... fez exatemente o que eu queria.... mate em dois !!!! será que ele não viu a outra torre ???!! gran finale !!
-------------------------------------
 é difícil ver um tabuleiro tão bonito no final de uma partida !!! 
-------------------------------------
lance que caracteriza o "ataque fegatello".  lance surpreendente, porém duvidoso. lance duvidoso. a melhor continuação e que dá boa vantagem para as brancas é bxf7+. df6 era melhor, segundo o rybka. cxf7 é melhor. bxd4 era uma possibilidade boa, talvez melhor. lance duvidoso. melhor seria bg5, contra o qual as negras jogariam dxd4, mantendo vantagem. tomar de bispo era melhor. lance duvidoso. be2 era quase forçado. lance interessante, mas duvidoso. bxb2!! dava vantagem decisiva à negras. se as brancas tomam o bispo, as negras jogam td8 com vantagem decisiva. dei xeque perpétuo, pois as brancas saíam da mesa (coisas do ping), mas as negras ainda têm clara vantagem, embora tenham desperdiçado várias chances boas durante a partida.  sugiram jogarem no ping o lance 4.    ,cxe4 (já joguei até em pensadas, o que não aconselho), para treinar posições agudas e eventualmente surpreender o adversário.  depois colocarei aqui a melhor continuação para as brancas, mas sugiro que já vão tentando encontrar a melhor sequência depois de 5.bxf7+,re7.

esta partida me llegó por mail. es una experiencia interesante poder comentar partidas. en parte, la búsqueda de la verdad en el tablero, pero, por otro lado, la comprensión de las diversas jugadas efectuadas por los ajedrecistas.  la defensa philidor, aparenta tranquilidad, pero su estructura de peones la transforma muchas veces en una dinámica india de rey, una de las más activas defensas. en general, una pérdida de tiempo. más clásico parece 3 d4 y 3 ac4. esto no ayuda mucho. las negras podían aprovechar el desliz de las blancas jugando 3.., cf6 y enrocando con prontitud. ahora, en cambio, se devuelve el favor, las casillas blancas quedarán tocadas, en especial "d5" otra vez... dándole un aire al alfil en caso de ser expulsado de su bastión en "c4" las negras confían en que lo cerrada de la posición les brinda tranquilidad...  ¡ajá! ahí está, ahora las blancas buscan juego en el flanco de dama en b3 parece más preciso las aguas se han calmado un poco y las blancas siguen con su diagonal a2-g8, así como también el peón de "a6", la casilla "a5" y, en un tono un tanto menor, la "d5" las negras quisieran apostar por la columna c; mientras, las posibilidades de atacar por el flanco de rey parecen escasas buscando las casillas blancas. el alfil a toda máquina! aquí se aprecia una de las consecuencias de "h6" las blancas presionan sobre "f7" y le echan un ojo a d5, la retirada del caballo negro a "h7" solo empeora las cosas reagrupando las negras recuperan terreno grave error, aunque doliera se debia permitir doblar los peones en f6.  axd8, es más simple. la doble amenaza de axf6 o si axd5, exd5 tocando al caballo de "e6" se lleva una pieza o calidad apuros de tiempo en posición perdida  
-------------------------------------
like so many, i was an avid chess player in high school and college, but gave it up entirely until later in life. in my younger days, i played 1. e4 exclusively. back then i had time to keep track of the myriad defenses that black can use. at this stage of life, its just not worth the effort. it is true that there are a lot of defenses to 1. d4 but the positions tend to be more similar and morph into one another more easily than the 1. e4 games. i have had more trouble with 3. ... d5, which usually leads to a more unbalanced position than the king's indian. i have not faced the grunfeld enough to feel confident yet that i know how to deal with it. in the handful of grunfelds i have played as white, my most smashing success was with the wild and crazy 4. g4, but this was only because my shocked opponent blundered almost immediately. my first attempt with the saemisch. this move never made much sense to me; white neglects development to make yet another pawn move and takes away the most logical square for his king's knight. initially i tried the seemingly more natural 5. nf3 against the k's indian, but i was not satisfied with the resultant positions. black seems able to complete his development unproblematically and eventually play ... e5 or ...c5, chipping away at white's pawn center and thus achieve the main goal of the k's indian. so for a while i switched to 5. f4 which got better results, but only through luck in my opinion. 5. f3 supports the center better than 5. f4 and while it is not a developing move, it aims at hindering black's natural development by taking away the g4 square from the king's knight (should white decide to play be3) or the queen's bishop (should white decide to play nf3). this is not the only option, of course. the database i use gives ... e5 as the most played move here, followed by the text, ... nbd7, and ... c5. i like either ... e5 or ... c5 here, as i think black has to hit white's strong center right away. at least in this game, black did not have the luxury of leisurely development! ... c5 of course can involve a pawn sacrifice, but black's results seem to be good. the other main possibility is 7. qd2, but i figured: why commit the queen just yet? there is only one reasonable square for the knight, so let's move it first and see what black does. according to the db, the most played move, but it seems dreadfully slow to me. i prefer an immediate hit on the center with ... e5. if white responds 8. d5, then after ... na5, 9. ng3 (or nc1), c5, black has achieved his opening goals. this is an attempt to preserve the kb (if white should play bh6 black can retreat to h8 without losing his kr). yet surely it is way too slow? black can still play ...e5 here and answer d5 with na5, as on the previous move. even ... rb8 seems preferable. true, in this case white can force the exchange of black squared bishops, but one wonders if this is worth facing the possibility of ... b5. probably ... nxh5 was preferable, because after the pawn exchange hxg6 fxg6, the e6 square becomes dreadfully weak. after 11 ... nxh5; 12. g4 nf6; i was planning 13. ng3, to be followed with qh2 and g5. however kanko vs. graeffe (finland 1991) continued 13. nd5 bxc4; 14. nxf6+ exf6; 15.nc3 na5 16.qh2 and black was crushed. with an eye not only on h5, but also e6 which is about to become weak. this is better than 15 ... nd7?? 16. ne6! 1-0 as actually occurred in stake larsen vs. sorseth (gausdal 1999). nevertheless, ... g5 is much better. black does not seem to understand what trouble he is in. in view of what happens, perhaps it would have been better for black to accept the loss of a piece with 16 ... g5; 17 e5, h6; 18. exf6, exf6; 18 ng2 finally! of course, it's way too late. 20... re7 would have held out a bit longer. of course, black would love to take the pawn, but that runs into 23. qxh7+ kf7 24. qf5+ ke7 25. rh7 qe1+ 26. rd1 qe3+ 27. kb1 with the dual threat of rxg7 and nd5+ this runs into a quick mate. amazingly, my computer tells me that black can survive to an endgame, albeit a piece down via this route: … ke8 27. qg6+ kd8 28. rh7 bf8 29. rxd6+ kc7 30. rxe7+ kxd6 31. rd7+ kc5 32. e7 bxe7 33. rxe7 qf4+ 34. kb1 rd8 35. nc3 rd2 36. na4+ kd4 (not ... kb4 as black gets mated). i find it hard to believe that there isn't an improvement for white in this line. the idea is to pin the black kb, threatening rh8++ black resigns. he can stave off immediate mate by giving up his queen for a rook, but then he cannot stop rh7 followed by n-e3-f5. 
-------------------------------------
в настоящий момент я начинаю именно так :) черный выбирают староиндийское продолжение защита нимцовича. ничего военного не происходит. очередной ход черных легко угадывается (сb4). ... интересны поворот событий. судя по всему черные планируют фианкетировать белопольного слона. укрепление центра, активизация слона f1.  фактически получился розыгрыш защиты нимцовича с потерей одного темпа. белые не боятся размена на b4. стратегический план - под прикрытием пешечного центра развить слонов в направлении королевского фланга черных и его последующая атака при активное поддержке состороны ферзя (а возможно и ладьи).  черные таки фианкетируют белопольного ферзя. в далеке вырисовывается атака на королевский фланг белых с участием слона и ферзя при поддержке пешек королевскго фланга и коня f6 (c5, фс7, фс6, ...).  черные начинают активные действия при незавершенном развитии. у белых "промахов" в развитии вроде бы нет. силы атакующего не значительные - две фигуры. по класике жанра такая атака для черных ничего хорошего принести не может  :) проще разменять. держать одновоременно под прикрытием ферзя двух коней невозможно - можно получить сдвоенные пешки на линии f и открытого короля ... в тоже время уничтожен защитник позиции короля.  белые заверают развитие - осталась только рокировка. в тоже время этим ходом они провоцируют черных на еще один размен фигур. в результате этого размена чернопольный слон белых станет займет очень удобный для него пункт c3. так же можно было бы и сразу 0-0. можно подвести итоги дебюта. у белых практически весь центр и все развитые фигуры, осталась только рокировка. у черных только один развитый слон. теперь белые полностью завершили развитие. не смотря на резмены стратегический план белых прежний - атака слоном, конем и ферзем на позицию короткой рокировки. читаемый ход. черные должны развиваться. белые должны немедленно переходить в атаку.  лучшего хода в данной ситуации я не видел  :)  белые грозят согнать коня и стать ферзем на d4. также можно попытаться воспользоваться незащещенности черного слона на e4. сказывается ощутимый перевес белых в центре после дебюта. результат - черным фигурам становится тесно. первый материальный резутат позиционного перевеса! черный слон е4 спойман. у черных только один ход - f6. после передышки атака возобновится. белым надо думать как "ломать" оборону возле короля. такого подарка судьбы белые неожидали. пункт g7 становится самым слабым звеном в позиции черных. помимо этого черный конь получил превосходный плацдарм на g5. естественный ход. белые намечают смертельный удар на g7. у черных только один ход... основной принцып стратегии - концентрация. к атаке на ограниченном участке подключается третяя фигура. спасти ситуации уже врядле можно. черные сдались. 
-------------------------------------
fisrt burst is from black. an "osé" move, interesting. of course i can go e4, attacking the pawn, but then b4, and maybe black can cause the game turn its way, not mine... so this was profilactic. i'm not sure black's pawns storm would have been good or bad, should i? black seems not to be in a hurry, so i can take my room in the center.  now, this was innecessary. black could have defended the pawn with a6, or he can even thought about to sac it with b4 at once, while axb will be followed by d5, with no tempo loss because white has to care about his b4 pawn.  of course.  natural was c6, this is the purpose to leave the nb8 in b8, right? consolidating the kingside, preparing for an attack.  three moves (not bxn, of course!). 9. ba4, and i keep the bishop preventing the black knight from developing. good. 9. bc4, and i prevent black to advance the d or the f pawn. good. and 9. bd3, and the bishop is aiming to h7. good. so it is one of the most difficult moves to do: which is the best? what i am not seeing? black is already half-cramped. ba4 is kind of "naive". black can move bb7, nc6, and that's it. bc4 has to cope with nb6... ba2 or b3, and black wins a tempo to untangle himself. is tempting, true, to keep control on the diagonal against the king.  i want to move e5, but it should be prepared. ng5, nxd4 have to be calculated at any moment, so i better waste a tempo in preventing it forever, and... open a square for my queen on c2.  "cool". two in one.  clever, since if now e5, f5! and i cannot open the diagonal! very, very subtle, i liked it! of course, it opens a hole in e6.  but i was sticking to my pawn's storm first plan. when the opponent advance its pawns, they become threatable of exchange or else.  seeing i am not attacking e6, black takes his chance to put the bishop on a very nice diagonal (since e5 is coming).  only way to open files. now black cannot move f5.  the bishop is hanging, ok, but after rxb, if the knight is in g5, it can jump to e6, forking the q and the r. but the knight has to be in that square, so hxg5 doesn't work. bxg5, bxb, hxg5 is ok. i choose the risky way, just for fun and for testing my intuition.  black falls into it. but chess is not simple.  this sac seems to be meaningless, but look.  qe8, but after nxc7, qh5 and black attacks. now, note that e5 is followed by bxr, and i'm not sure my attack will overwhelm him up to that point.  the knight plays a much better role where it is. i am giving my h pawn, but... who cares? this is almost good for me. and after it, o-o-o (i don't care about the f2 pawn either) is very strong.  black thinks correctly that to counter white's rook and to guard h7 is better than to threat f2, but... now, e5 is just fine, but i was playing in "blitz" mode.  greedy, wasn't i? not at all.  this was the plan behing rxb. not nf1, because i wanted to have the black rook out of the column first.  it was probably better to retire the rook. but note that now i am "only" -1.  and now this is lethal.  nf8 doesnt work because of nxn. or qxc7.  not qxb beacuse of rxb2+.  black resigns, there is no trick for black. an interesting game, i would say.  
-------------------------------------
so he starts with what i usually play.  i reply with a grunfeld defence. i have already annotated a game with this line http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/colwyn-bay-2-v-malpas-whitchurch?gm=54435 all this has been seen many times before. it was the old "main line" of the grünfeld defence, exchange variation. please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence#exchange_variation:_4.cxd5_nxd5_5.e4 from about 1960 to about 1980 it wasn't played much, it being replaced by smyslov's idea of 10....qc7 followed by 11. rc1 rd8, but this was rather put out of business by 12. bf4! so players went back to this older system. to quote from wiki "this was frequently played by karpov, including four games of his 1987 world championship match against kasparov in seville, spain, is the seville variation, after 6...bg7 7.bc4 c5 8.ne2 nc6 9.be3 0-0 10.0-0 bg4 11.f3 na5 12.bxf7+, long thought a poor move by theory, as the resultant light-square weakness had been believed to give black more than enough compensation for the pawn. in the aforementioned game white took on f1 with the queen, rather than the king, but it doesn't make much difference. his c4 square is now very weak, but i can't play nc4 immediately as he has qb3 pinning my knight against my king. white protects the g4 pawn. black hits the e pawn white protects. i offer the exchange of queens. it is unusual for the side a pawn down to offer a queen exchange. however the ending is not that bad for black. white's extra pawn is doubled and on the king-side, where the king's are, and it is very difficult for white to exploit this extra pawn. this looks like a mistake to me. in previous games, white had exchanged queens on c5. black's knight has a tremendous square on c5, but white has the extra pawn. chances are even. i considered retreating the queen to e6 now. i wondered if he would advance his queen again to d3 and we could just keep repeating the position and agree a draw. however i was very much aware that on board 3 and 4 we were heavily out-graded and stood very little chance. i would have to win if my team were to get anything out of this match, so i played.... this, building up pressure on the d pawn and pinning the d pawn to the queen. he calmly moves his king to a safer square and unpinning his knight at the same time. i build up again against d4. note how the d4 pawn is doubly pinned. it can't take on e5 or c5 as it is pinned by the rook against the white queen, and it can't advance without losing his e4 pawn. the d4 pawn is now attacked by five pieces (2 pawns, a bishop, rook and a queen) and protected four times - so i am threatening to take it. this move saves the d pawn, as if i take on d4, he takes back with the c pawn, discovering an attack on my queen with his rook. this is the key position. i looked at qxa2 20. ra1 qb3 21. qxb3+ nxb3 22. ra3 and at the time i thought i was losing the knight on b3. however i see now that in that position i can save it with c5-c4, or i can take on d4, which threatens his bishop on e3. this is clearly what i should have played, or maybe take on d4 first with my c pawn. either way i think black would have had an advantage. however i tried another way, which just loses for me, although it looks very plausible!  i take this way, to open up my diagonal for my bishop more. he takes back, uncovering at attack on my queen. i can still take on a7, but now he can take back on c5 with his rook, reducing the pressure on d4. i think the position is pretty even then, but, as i was saying, i was playing for a win, but this led to a loss. so i played this. i thought this position was good for me. i still have the two-way pin on the d pawn. of course, i saw that his bishop can drop back and hit my queen, but what of it? i can take on d4 with my bishop. he can't then recapture with his knight, as then i take back with the queen, give check and follow up with qxbd2 and i am a piece up. of course he doesn't have to capture on d4, he could simply move his king, but then i move my queen, and if he takes my knight, i recapture with my queen. no problem there? or is there? so he hits my queen. i take the pawn. this king moves to safety. my queen retreats. he takes. i take back. ouch! that was the move i missed when i was considering my 19th move. how could i miss it, when i noticed it when considering my 14th move? i put it down to two things. one "is playing for win". the other is "dizziness due to success" 0- i was getting so carried away with how i had pressure on his position and was getting my pawn back, that i didn't notice this. i don't have much choice now, as advancing the king loses the b7 pawn with check, and moving to f8 allows his rook to come over to f1 with a killing check. i think black is lost now.  as i said, this is the only square left. he takes here. i make another mistake here. taking back with the rook is pretty dreadful. after rxd4 26.	qxb7	qxa2 27. rxc5 he is threatening  rc8 he is threatening both 28. rc8+ forcing qg8 and black's queen goes, and if qg8 28. rc8 rd8 29.	rc7 with the dreadful threat of qb2+, but black may be able to hold on for a bit longer. as played, the c file is opened for white rook to come into the position immediately and black is lost. so i took this way. while studying this position, i thought at first 26. qxb7 could be met with qb6, but then i saw that he just plays qf7 followed by rc7 and it is all over. come to think of it, can't he play 26. qf7 immediately? it looks all over for me. with some relief to me, he didn't play that and played. this. i tried the one move i thought may hold on a while. this briefly restores the material balance. with a threat to h7. queen comes back to protect. i offer a draw. he rejects, not surprisingly. he is not just a pawn up, his queen and rook have dominating positions. played with my next move in mind. the pawn starts to roll. this move is not necessary. he could already play the winning manoeuvre of rf7 followed by qe7. threatening some checks. rook hits the queen. the queen is forced back. again, not sure why he plays this. qe7 simply wins. i am not sure why i played this! i think i was just basically running out of moves. my king can't move. my queen can't move without allowing a quick mate. my rook can't move along the back rank without allowing qxd4+ mating. d4-d3 allows qa1 mating. rd6 loses to qc5. he finally sees it, and i resign. many thanks for reading this annotation. please leave your comments and rate it on the star system. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
being a true winner, the only move i had expected from him. i decided to surprise him... the keres system, one of my favourites next to 2. f4... i prefer this over nf3, any day... of course, black was not totally surprised. he had read my bio, past game history, and so on. he was expecting 2. f4... exactly the reason, i didn't play it... so he decided, to play my favourite with black, 2. ... g6, in most cases... out of respect for doctor keres, i would play 2. ... nf6, the nimzowitch approach. i lost some fine games against that; they drawed ;) most replies in the sicilian defense fail now. white prevents a quick d5... the trick with this variation is, that bc8-g4 can never threaten the kings knight - defender of d4 - because of f2-f3... nc3 can be replaced by ne2-c3, let say after nc3-d5... paul keres made a great contrubution to fighting the sicilian, with this plan... 5. ... d6 6. nd5 nf6 7. nxf6... where's the sicilian maffia when you need them... enters the sicilian dragon, accelerated, no less... at this stage, the queen must never leave the d-file... 7. nxc6 bxc6 8. e5 ng8 9. f4 nh6 leads to nothing... attacking the bishop... there is little hope in 7. ... 0-0 8. rd1... back to the drawing board, for black, we are leaving the sicilian trail... after 8. ... bxc6 9. bd4, white wins the opening stage... after 9. ... bxd4 (0-0, bxg7 is worse) 10. qxd4 (hence 7. qd2) f6 (0-0, h3, nf6) 11. be2 ne5, white has nice play... trying to make something out of nothing, el nuño chatted... forced... surely, nxf2, nxf2, bxb2, rd1, ke8 (else bc3+), c3 is no option... better then 12. bc3 bxc3 13. nxc3 kc7 14. h3 nf6... and much stronger, then directly f4... 12. h3 nf6 promises white nothing... 12. ... nf6 13. c3 bb6! 14. ne3 nd7 looked fine for black... f4 is constant threat, now... 13. f4 nd7, and all is well for black... this is a forcing move... 14. ... kc7 15. f4 nd7 is surely sounder... i wanted to release the pressure on a2... after f4, nd7... my plan of be2, ..., kf2 (let alone 0-0), didn't please me anymore... black is planning an attack against whites kingside... we seek temporary solitude at the queenside... practically forced, or else 0-0-0+, and white wins a tempo... 15. ... nd7 16. rd1, forfeiting 0-0-0 alltogether...  decisions, decisions... i wanted to keep f4, and be2 as precious threats... maybe not best. i had promised myself not to castle the long-shot but it seemed tempting, because blacks pieces are not in position for a queenside attack... had i not played a3, now bxa2 for sure, and black wins... so far, whites strategy worked. black collapses under the pressure of f4... i was expecting rad8, or h5... the only move, in all variations... complete development... the temporary closure of the d-file gives us (both) precious time to re-organize, and use the half-open d-file to our benefits... black has to start a new plan... maybe better, is straightaway 19. h5 g5 20. b4, and keep the rooks on board... the plan is, to clean up the attack on the kingside, and travel my king back there, but i am probably better off with two rooks... this reply caught me off balance, i was reckoning with 22. ... bf7 23. h6 e6... 22. ... a5! clears all tensions... black is opening the a-file... again, black finds the strongest reply. maybe 25. rd1 ra4 26. c3 was better, because we have ke1, but i didn't like the idea of bb3!... the only way, for white... black is playing only forcings, now... soon, white will have to exchange rooks, or travel his king back to the kingside, at last... i felt, it was too early to exchange rooks with 28. nc2, and ra1... altough this game must end in a forced draw, black has still to prove his point... a trick question, avoiding the issues... all other moves are delusional, for white... rc1 belongs... i was reckoning with 29. ... bb3, preventing rc2... new material... let's see, what he makes of this... tempo play... it was surely about time, to play bf7, to free the e-pawn... relentless... plan a is fulfilled: the kingside is under control... now solve the queenside... ad lib... black is thriving into trouble... i was reckoning... forcing b5... after 34. ... b5, i had planned 35. rc2 ra1 36. kf2, and after 34. ... c4 35. be2, via conditional moves. something must have gone wrong, it resulted in this... lesson: never use condition moves, sheer out of impatience... of course... chess blindness, still pretty much oblivious of what happened at move 35... in my mind, rc1 was on c2, and his on a1... so i played 36. kf2 out of blind faith; rc2 was still in order... white loses a tempo here, and his precious edge... now, he will have to fight, for a draw... my punishment for ignoring keres' rule: never play 0-0-0, or 0-0. play f3, kf2... from now on fourth, i will always have to exchange bishops at e2, and take back with a pinned knight... i admit it full blooded: we had some (well-earned?) fortune... after 36. ... kc6!! (pulls the hook out of any threats against b5) 37. ke1/kf1 (lost tempo at 36) bd5! (prepares e6, and prevents kf3), white has to start worrying... the text is forcing for white, after 36. ... bf7, nf5 is the only viable move... of 40. ... rd5, i am not utterly convinced. i feared rd6, nd4/nf4 etc... this is very unclear now. after 41. ... rd3+/rf5+ 42. ke4! (rf5+, kg4, rf6 is better for black), white suddenly has nd4! damned knight?! i saw more light in the tunnel for black, after 41. ... kd6 42. nf4 (else rd3) rf5 43. kg4 rf6 44. kg5 nb2!, preventing rd1... just in time... the draw is settled. the most spectaculair variation (since both sides are forced) is 42. ... nxc3 43. nxc3 (rd7+ leads to the same variation) rh3+ 44. kf4 rxc3 45. rd7+ kc6 46. rxe7 rh3 47. rxh7 c3! 48. rh8 c2 49. rc8+ kd6 50. rxc2 rxh6 51. rc5 rxe6 52. rxb5... although white has a pawn left, he can never win; because of eternal checks by black, whites king cannot get to the pawn, and whites rook cannot get behind it... after 42. ... rh3+ 43. ke4, we lead into variations with eternal checks... 43. ... nb6 (to prevent rd7) 43. nd4 na4 (or else, trouble for black), same... my opponent hates forcings by now. let's see, what this variation does... 43. ... nd5 is a nice forcing, also; white has to follow... all is pretty much forced, for both sides... 46. kg4 works, also... this is a very tense position. 46. ... nxc3/ne3+ 47. nxc4+/kxg2 doesn't work... in fact, 46. ... rh5 47. rd4, neither... after 48. ... rxb4 49. rd7 rh4 50. rxe7 rxh6 51. kg3... no more beating, around the bush... 49. ... rxe6 50. rg7 rxh6 (else rxh7, and black might even lose) 51. rxe7... this is a technical draw, because blacks pawn cannot be held, like whites pawn... after 49. ... rxb4 50. rg7, i expect the return of the black king, 50. ... kc6, 51. rxe7 kd6 52. rxh7 kxe6 53. kg3 kf6 54. rd7 kg6 (ke6?, h7, and black loses) 55. h7 rb8... blacks king is keeping whites king away from h7, whites pawn will be lost... i sent a draw offer, which was accepted... 
-------------------------------------
until here, standard, "book" moves. the two will manouver very slowly seeking for an attack line, in a strategic display. white has to risk some more if he wants an attack line. black has time to relocate his lsb on the big diagonal.  white's position seems overwhelming, while black is completely stuck on his third rank, pieces all together... normally, a losing scenario, but hey, it's kasparov behind it. he has everything under control. the deepness of the defence is far beyond my ability to decode it.  attacks b6 and, indirectly, f7. and delays the bishop's run to b7.  now the other bishop will search for the fianchetto. very delicate.  is karpov protecting b2 against a future b(g7)xb2? leontxo says white should have played f5 right now.   23.	f4-f5	e6-f5 24.	e4-f5	b7-g2+ 25.	h1-g2	c7-b7+ 26.	g2-g1	c8-c4 27.	f5-g6	c4-g4+ 28.	h3-g3	g4-g3+ 29.	h2-g3	d7-e5 30.	g6-h7+	g8-h8 31.	f2-f5	b4-c2 32.	f5-c2	e5-f3+ 33.	f1-f3	b7-f3 34.	c2-f2	f3-d3 it would be a mistake trying to get the advantage on c3:   23.	c1-e3	g7-c3 24.	b2-c3	c7-c3 25.	e3-d4	c3-h3 26.	g2-h3	c8-c2 27.	f2-h4	        b7-e4+ 28.	h1-g1	d7-f8 covering f7. now, f5 for white doesn't work anymore.  24.	f4-f5	e6-f5 25.	e4-f5	b7-g2+ 26.	h1-g2	g7-c3 27.	b2-c3	c7-c3 28.	e3-d4	c3-c2 29.	g2-g1	c2-f2+ 30.	f1-f2	e7-e1+ 31.	f2-f1	e1-f1+ 32.	g1-f1	g6-f5 white is attacking, but he has some weaknesses he has to take care of.  can you imagine how deep calculations must be performed in order to be able to play this? "kasparov entrega b6 a cambio de armonía y actividad." says leontxo: kasparov gives away b6 seeking for harmony (piece coordination) and activity.  i won't say ?, but it seems to deserve it. the pawn costed 2 tempoes, and the white's queenside is weak. the white's attack over the black king is not going anywhere, right now.  karpov needs to win, he cannot allow a draw.  better thank nxe4, according to leontxo. this move wins the c2 pawn, and eliminate one of the most active white pieces.  white is now playing against black's central pawns.  qxq, rxq, bh3! would have be the right move. leontxo says karpos was in time trouble here.   36.	b6-b8	e8-b8 37.	g2-h3	b8-b3 38.	h3-e6	b3-c3 39.	b2-c3	g7-c3 40.	d1-d6	g8-g7 41.	e6-f7	g7-f7 42.	h4-h7+ 3 pawns for a piece would be nice, but more white pawns will fall.  leontxo says this is a mistake. in fact, rb1+, nxr, qxn+, and white has a hard time defending against multiple threats. but here, the simple ne3 seems to win.  this was actually played. i don't understand why not ne6++, winning the queen. maybe is there a mate somewhere.  
-------------------------------------
this was in the 4ncl online it was played on lichess. my opponent is mikeymouse456 on there he plays the alapin variation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_defence,_alapin_variation "the main line in current practice is 2... nf6 3. e5 nd5 and can also arise if white offers, and black declines, the smith–morra gambit (1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 nf6 4.e5 nd5).  white has a number of options including 4.d4, 4.nf3, 4.g3 and 4.bc4." he advances my knight runs he advances in the centre. more or less forced, otherwise white plays c4 and d5 he takes back i attack the centre he develops i develop his bishop comes out. knight goes back, tempting white into an unsound bishop sacrifice on f7 but he doesn't fall for that so i take he takes back. i take he takes back. i prepare to fiancetto my bishop, to take aim at the pawn on e5. he castles. i attack the pawn. he protects it. not only attacking e5 but also attacking b2, meaning that he can't protect e5 in the most natural way, bc1-f4 meaning that this is the only way to protect the pawn. so now i am threating e5 again. so he takes off the knight attacking it. i take back he attacks my knight. i take his knight. he takes mine. my bishop drops back. he at last secures his e5 pawn, but what about his c4 pawn? so i attack it he defends i attack it again he counter-attacks not only defends, but this stops his c pawn from advancing. so now he protects c4 i attack the defender the only square! rc3 loses to bd2  i attack his rook again. he moves back. now i think i can force a draw here with 22.....be6 23 rc2 bf4 24. rb2 etc but i thought i saw a way to win a pawn, but my plans included a miscalculation! so i attack th pawn from this angle. his knight advances. i thought "if i take the c pawn with the bishop then he would take the a pawn with his knight. but what if i take with the rook? he can't then take the a pawn as then i could take his bishop with my rook.   so i took it. ok stop - find white's move now. did you find it? incidentally white would still have had this move if i had taken with the bishop not the rook. i take. he takes back with a discovered check king up he takes my rook. i take the pawn. so i thought that i have bishop and pawn for a rook, but my king is active and i have a queen-side pawn majority. i felt i had chances of saving the game if i got my queen-side pawn rolling and played actively. he is trying to cut my bh6 out of the game. i decide to exchange his re1 before it becomes active. this may be a mistake - normally one tries to exchange pawns not pieces if materially down. i would appreciate views. so he takes. i take back. rook of course has to move. so bishop drops back. of course not bc4? or bc2? and rc3! wins. he attacks the bishop again. bishop drops back, preventing any rook checks. rook pins the bishop i start to mobilise my queen-side majority. he advances the king. pawn up again. he attacks my bishop bishop retreats. he attacks my pawn. pawn up he blocks out my bishop. i advance again. he attacks my b pawn. i advance. he takes. i recapture this way. if i take back with the pawn, then he has ra1 and his rook has free reign into my position. his king comes up again. and so does mine. he solidly blocks the a pawn. i threaten to advance it again. he blocks it again. i throw in a check. king across. blocking his king-side pawns on black squares, where they may be vulnerable to by black squared bishop, should his rook try and penetrate my position. he offers a bishop exchange. i throw in a check, hoping for kc3? bd4+ and wins. but he doesn't fall for those. hitting his rook. with the idea of penetrating my position, but i have my counter prepared. this is part of the plan. the rook comes in. i prevent rd7+ his king comes across. a waiting move. he attacks my h pawn. so i put it on a safer square. rook comes back across. my king comes in. now 49. re6 wins a pawn for him, but may well lose the game after 49....be4+ and 50...kb3. so he comes here. and my king drops back. i think kd5 also draws. his king comes back up but now his king-side pawns are weak. he attacks my g pawn. i take he takes. preparing to pop my bf3 on g4 protecting my king-side pawns. king across bishop back. he comes in to pick up my bishop, but i prepared a counter. stop and find black's next move. did you find it? it is the only move i think. he takes. i take.  presumably preparing rh7 and advancing the h pawn. but i still have the passed a pawn. he prevents kb6 and threatens rb4! i prevent the check and also free up my f pawn to advance. he attacks my bishop i attack his rook. so the rook retreats. pawn advances. his bishop drops back i throw in a check. king moves. i block his h pawn and a draw is agreed. many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two and use the star system to rate the annotation. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
so he starts with the usual as i do he signifies a preference for a closed sicilian and i develop usual in this variation, although g3 is more popular (see my annotated game http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/kidderminstervhalesowenbd1?gm=42465) and i adopt a similar set up as i did in that game. he develops and so do i he hits the knight and i prevent the doubling of pawns. he castles i develop and so does he i put the question to his bishop, although later i found out that nd4 actually scores very well for black. 0-0 seems to be better too. so he takes i take back. now this is an interesting position. after the game my opponent said that he couldn't decide between e5 and f5 and he eventually played e5, and he wasn't sure that this was right. i replied that i thought e5 was stronger, but he made a mistake in not maintaining the pawn on e5, supporting it with re1 and maybe qe2, rather than exchanging it. i see on the gameknot world database, there is one game with e5 rendle thomas (2397) vs. kakkanas evange… (2064) which ended in a draw, and one with f5, lalic, susan (2320) vs. makropoulou, ma… (2305) which white won. however i still think e5 is stronger! and now i think i must hit this pawn as soon as possible. as i have two bishops i want to open up the position for my bishops. rendle thomas (2397) vs. kakkanas evange… (2064) continued with 9......d5, but why head into a blocked position where his knights are better than my knight and bishop? the search engine "shredder" now suggests 10. ne4 as best for white, with a slight advantage for white. i think the move he played was a mistake. shredder thinks it is equal now. so i take back. he hits the queen. now qe7 is the obvious move, keeping the c pawn protected, but i thought that i wanted to prevent him from playing d4, so i played my queen back to d7. shredder surprisingly suggests retreating to c7 and if 12. nxc5 then nd5 winning the pawn back on c2, with equality. of course he can't take on c5 as i have a check on d4 which picks up the knight on c5. so he really does threaten pc5 now. i thought this was a mistake as it leaves the d pawn backward, but shredder thinks it is best. so now i do have to protect my c pawn. shredder likes 13. ne5 and if nxe5 14. pxe5 bxe5 15. bf4! and if bxf4? 16. nf6+ winning the black queen and the game, and after bg7 nd6+ "with a slight advantage to white". thankfully my opponent didn't see this and played.... reasonable development. shredder prefers 0-0, but i was wanting to discourage d4. now 13. d4 can be met with exchanges on d4 and his ne4 is eventually left to be taken by bb7 shredder like bf2 and "the position is even". what white plays is plausible. at last! another obvious move. shredder recommends a room move for black now too, but i wanted to prevent d4 and played..... which also has the benefit of hitting a2. shredder now likes b4, but he played... the obvious move! shredder now also likes rook moves for black, but i played.... which shredder eventually finds too. as well as deterring b4, bb7 is coming to a6. black now stands slightly better, according to shredder so on with the plan.... and white is rather grovelling on the back 3 ranks... i had a long think here. i wanted to play r(a)d8, but was rather unhappy about the reply nc4, so i eventually played my other rook over, so as to meet nc4 with r(a)b8 followed by b5. shredder like qa2 here i thought white was rather meaninglessly moving his bits back and forth while i was improving the position of mine, but shredder still only gives this as slight advantage to black. planning to double on the d file, but without restricting my queen's movements too much. i thought this was another strategic mistake, making his d pawn forever backward, but in fact shredder likes this move. black still slightly better, according to my silicon friend. keeping on the d pawn. and i was happy to see this move - i see to have complete dominance of the long black diagonal - but he has a plan to neutralise this. shredder likes this move. preventing my queen coming in. keeping the pressure on d3 continuing with his plan my bishop has done its job on a6, not doing much there now, time to improve its position. i was dreaming of exchanging my nc6 for his nf3, getting my queen and bishop lined up on the long a8-h1 diagonal, so forcing his nf2 to move, allowing me to take on d3. unfortunately it didn't quite work out like that!  so he first protects f4 before playing bb2 shredder prefers nd4 first. contesting the long a1-h8 diagonal as part of my plan he takes i take back he takes i take back this way, to keep the pawn d3 under pressure. shredder now likes qd6 and "black is slightly better". i thought qd6 could be met by 29. ne4, but shredder thinks after bxe4, 30. dxe4 black still has the edge. so i played this he defends f4 eyeing the weak white squares.  and he offered a draw. i couldn't see any way of winning this, both of us were running low on time, so i accepted. shredder agrees this is now equal. the question is "did i miss a win?" what do you think dear reader? please leave a comment or two, and rate my annotation with the star system. many thanks! 
-------------------------------------
so he starts with the most popular and i reply with my normal in this case leading to a closed variation of the sicilian, although sometimes white follows up with nf3 or ne2 and following it up with d4, going back into the open sicilian so i keep my options open and he confirms a closed sicilian. an immediate 2. g3 is best met with d5, so 2. nc3 prevent this so i can play this without any fear of him transposing into the yugoslav attack against the sicilian dragon the natural follow up and i do likewise he develops again this is my usual in this variation, planning ng-e7 and d5, as opposed to the usual plan of playing for b5 he hits the c pawn in line with my plan. i was thinking that d5 will now threaten d4 forking be3 and nc3. after the game stuart said that he had had this position before, and black had then played d6, and he had continued as in the game. going for a king side attack. so i continue to develop he plays very agressively calmly castling! on this the attack. he is already threatening h5, exchanging on g6, exchanging on g7 and qh6 followed by mate on h7, but there are defences. so i take he takes back now h5 can be met with g5 and his queen is in risk. i also have the option of rf7 protecting h7. also i have a long term plan - now that black squared bishops are exchanged, put all my pawns on white squares and then my bishop can weave in and out of them. afterwards i found out that this was played in perez garcia, h… (2255) vs. lemmers, oscar (2385), black won in 61 moves. he decides the queen isn't doing much there so i continue with my plan another agressive move and i carry on with my plan. shredder assesses this position as +1.14 to white. maybe my plan of putting pawns on black squares was too slow. maybe i should have stayed with my plan of d5. what do you think dear reader? with the idea of blocking the h file and also preventing him from castling. i was still reasonably confident. of course, if he had taken on e5, i would have taken on h5 keeping my pawns together shredder thinks this is a mistake, letting me back into the game, and prefers f5 or bf3. shredder says the position is now level shredder likes this move he takes back shredder prefers nd4 with equality, but i thought it may have good defence choices here, plus the chance to go to f5 and maybe take on g3. shredder now gives this as +1.9 for white "who has the upper hand shredder likes this move, but during the game i was considering 17.... nf5, and after the game we both thought maybe black should offer the exchange for a pawn with 17......dxe5 18. d6 qxd6 19. bxh8  shredder now thinks that white has a decisive advantage, after the game, stuart said the same..... more or less forced and this was the subtle little move that i missed, which wins.... nothing better really. immediately i played it, i saw the combination which he plays now, winning knight and bishop for rook. shredder actually prefers rh4 here "and white is +2.93 whereas now shredder thinks that white is "only" +1.99 forced, otherwise i lose a whole knight he takes i take back he takes the bishop i offer the g pawn, in order to move my king to safety. shredder agrees this is the best chance he castles i finally connect my rooks, and, i thought, got my king to a safe spot. shredder prefers rf2 he develops, with a threat of n-g5-e6 so i stop that i hadn't seen this move. now qc6+ is crushing so i prevent that he takes i take back and he wins the exchange, to leave himself a clear knight up, so i resigned. many thanks for reading this, please leave a comment, and rate it with stars. merry christmas and happy new year! 
-------------------------------------
hi everyone!  this unrated game was between myself and walking the walk & learning to run newbie, pawnish53 (joe).  joe has also only just joined gameknot and has so far played only 5 games, hence his low rating.  at the conclusion of his next game he will be issued with his provisional rating and an actual after his 20th.  so, i was playing an unknown quantity.  so, would king henry end up being caught in the centre?  well, you will just have to read on to find out.  i start with the reti opening. 2. d4 - first two moves follow my consultation game v ipissimus (martin), but black will deviate from this on his next turn. 3. …… bf5 - although this game does look as though it is transposing into the ipissimus game, g3 has already been played and i will follow up on the next turn with bg2.  this was one of the suggested moves in the ipissimus game so it will be interesting to see what the follow up is gonna be. 5. a3 - stopping nb4 or bb4+. 6. 0-0 - henry gets out of the centre - umph! 8. …… qxf6 - b for n trade.  black now has the option of castling queenside or kingside.  on the next turn king joe chooses queenside.  so, is it really possible for a king to be stuck in the centre post-castling?  we shall see. 10. nbd2 - glenda looks particularly innocuous on d1, wouldn't you agree?  looking at her you would never believe that she is capable of creating mayhem in the opposition camp, would you now? 10. ….. qg6 - right now it is the bq that looks the more threatening and there is every hint of a kingside pawn storm.  however, i see the opportunity of ridding black of his strong light square bishop. 13. nf3 - the seed of a plan to attack black's queenside is beginning to germinate in my head - first there will be a couple of petrosianesque type knight manoeuvres which look a bit silly but will lull my opponent into a false sense of security. 14. ne1 - merely preparing a queen trade but black chooses to keep the queens on.  is that wise?  we shall see. 16. e4 - i remember, long, long, ago a game against a very strong expert called heinzkat in which i lost on move 52.  my rating was in the 1500s at the time.  heinzkat pointed out that i had the opportunity to make a crucial pawn break e4 but failed to take it and i had condemned myself to the all too familiar passivitis.  so, i play e4.  this will lead to me getting a strong pawn centre.  in fact, i am now threatening to win a pawn by exd5, exd5, bxd5. 17. ….. ne7? - gasp!! here is the error - it loses a pawn and allows glenda a decisive penetration into black's position! 18. qxb7+ - zap! 18. …… kd7 - and king joe is forced into the centre! 19. qxa7 - kpow!!  21. qc2 - glenda hides herself from possible rook attack but not for long! 22. …… g4 - the much anticipated pawn storm is coming but that is as far as it gets. 23. c4 - threat - c5 winning joe's bishop. 24. rd1 - the storm clouds over black's position are starting to gather. 25. c5 - forcing black to clear a discovery line right through to his king! 26. …… c6? - so joe gives glenda another pawn to turn into dust - wowee! 27. ….. rhg8 - still thinking about attacking henry's castled position.  in the meanwhile a familiar dark dark shadow is moving ever closer to king joe - that's right, our chessic grim reaper old matey is not that far away. 29. d6!! - now i decline the queen trade and with good reason.  qd7# is threatened on the next turn.  joe can only avoid it with ruinous loss of material.  can you see how?  time to set the conditionals. 29. ….. bf8 - black prefers euthanasia. 30. qc7# - qc7 mate!! - now that bolt of lightening comes from those storm clouds and strikes down king joe.  it's so amazing that black's queenside castled position has been completely destroyed.  three oversights caused king joe to lose vital pawns around his castled position and drove his king back into the centre.  after that my queen made full use of the open lines at her disposal to snare king joe.  i think i can now safely say ……. 'ware glenda!!

hi everyone!  well, now that i have got my first ever expert victory out of the way i have another little gem for you against a near-expert called myrydin (tim).  despite a queenless middlegame a player whose king is stuck in the centre is gonna cop a little trouble.  in order to find out whether it is king henry or his welsh counterpart king myrydin that comes to grief you will just need to read on.  i begin with nf3 which is the reti opening.  ga analysis is here: https://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=27211149&rnd=0.27808322082055636  2. …… e6 - transposing into an english opening. 5. bd3 - after a few pawn moves on both sides i finally clear the way for kingside castling. 8. ….. na5 - instead of castling black decided to harass fou leblanc. 10. …...b5 - pawn roll. 12. e4 - pawn break threatening a pawn fork on e5. 16. ….. bxe6 - pawn trade. 19. ned4 - sir lollabout temporarily allows a pin on f3 but this will not last. 21. nxf3 - b for n trade. 22. e5 - king myrydin has let himself be stuck in the centre and a pawn thrust exploits it.  this will set of a chain of events that will win an important pawn. 23. re2 - first the pinned f2 pawn must be guarded. 24. be1 - uh oh, the familiar jo stevens passivits appears to set in …….. 25. qg5 - but glenda ensures that appearances are deceptive and she is eyeing up tim's pawn on g7. 26. ….. nxh6. 27. bc3 - putting pressure on g7. 28. e6 - threatening a bishop fork on g7. 29. bg6+ - black's last move prevented that fork but allowed another.  tim's h5 pawn is hanging. 31. bg6 - fou leblanc keeps king myrydin stranded on the back row and locks in his king rook. 32. nd4 - sir lollabout supports my vital e6 passer. 34. ….. rgh5 - he lays a trap but i see that henry will cop old matey on h1 if i take his g4 knight. i must be patient, very patient. 36. rd1 - threatening mayhem along the d file.  tim decides to wave the white flag at this juncture.  ga confirms resignation on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as i have a plus score of 6.48.  a fascinating example of how an uncastled king can be in danger even when the queens have been exchange and on move 36!  i hope you have had a good read and another example of a king being caught in the centre will occur in my jo against the titans game against coach ion.  it is henry but against a player of expert/master strength such as ion, will it be a recipe for disaster?  well, wait and see.  till next time, bye for now - joanne 
-------------------------------------
i am black against linus. scandinavian king of hill hmm, trying to get to the central 4. bye bye  threatening to win. easily stopped bait. blocking  well my king out ooh! escaping the check that falls into another probably better was 7... e5, but this threatens to win which is stopped. whatever  winning back a pawn  threatening discovered check. not stopped? discovered check. escape  threatening to win, white cannot take the queen. stopped, but... !!! only delays... check, leading to king in centre square d5 or e5 final move. i win! my king is on the “hill!” 
-------------------------------------
i keep winning, anyway... gambit! accepted!!! yahoo guarding the pawn, damn it... king out, going to attack pawn... what? i think much better was qh5+, but i don’t know, i am just rated above 1300, and even normal chess, let alone koth, is tough against others. threatening to win stopped... but looses the pawn qd4+, i think, would be best... attack!!! skewer you. blocked! run away, doo doo doo doo doo doo, run away doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,  run away doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, run away!! (baby shark song) check forced check not forced check forced not a check not forced. ?? check! forced check forced !!! forced my king on the hill yet again... 
-------------------------------------
итак защита беккера - рекомендованная самим капабланкой. таким путем черные уклоняются от острейшего гамбита муцио
-------------------------------------
  белые пытаются как можно скорее вскрыть линии для атаки
-------------------------------------
  другая возможность заключалась в: 8. d5 ne5 9. bd3 bg4 
-------------------------------------
  положение обострилось, черные угрожают выиграть материал
-------------------------------------
  етественно что черные не берут на  f3
-------------------------------------
  и все-таки белые жертвуют фигуру: думается что жертва компенсируется потерей рокировки черных и их неразвитостью
-------------------------------------
  может было хорошо и : 12. bxd4 nxd4 13. qg3 qh4 (надеясь на ловушку топорной выделки 13... nxc2+ 14. kd2 qf6 15. kxc2 +- и у белых порядок !!!) 14. qxh4 nf3+ 15. kf2 nxh4-+
-------------------------------------
  наверно лучше  было: 12... bxc3 13. bxc3 qf6 -+
-------------------------------------
  несмотря на отсутствие фигуры у белых активная позиция !  альтернатива: 17. bd3 rg7 18. rxg7 nxg7 19. nxc7 qxf4+ 20. rd2  не кажется лучшей
-------------------------------------
  здесь можно было бы сыграть интересней:
-------------------------------------
 например: 20. e6 ne7 21. qd3 f5 (но не 21... nxd5?? - самоубийство 22. qxh7 ke7 23. exf7 +-)
-------------------------------------
  здесь черные могли бы сыграть: 21... rd8 22. rg8+ ke7 23. re1 -+
-------------------------------------
  интересная позиция возникала после: 22. exd6 cxd6 (но ни вкоем случае не 22... qxd6 23. rg8+ ke7 24. re1+ qe6 25. qg3 +-  и белые выигрывают) 23. rg4 qf2 24. qxc6 rh8 =+ (брать 24... qxh2 ??  хуже яда 25. rg8+ ke7 26. re1+ qe5 27. rxe5+ dxe5 28. kc1 +-  и белые побеждают)
-------------------------------------
  думается слабее: 22... rd8 23. rg8+ ke7 24. re1 =+
-------------------------------------
  борьба продолжается !
-------------------------------------
 migchess20: 9.cxd5 esta continuación la considero mejor, ya que los peones centrales ejercen mayor tensión al juego. 9...ag4 10.0–0 axf3 11.axf3 cbd7 12.te1 te8 migchess20: 9...ce4 el caballo en la casilla e4 ejerce mayor control en el centro del tablero 10.cxd5 cc6 11.dc2 f5 12.exd6 starts a chain of exchanges in order to relieve the pressure on the black position. migchess20: creo que es mejor mantener el par de alfiles para un final y no hacer el cambio por el caballo. es mas fuerte el par de alfiles que alfil y caballo. white has an advanced free pawn, pressure on the f-file. the weak point could be the open d4-g1 diagonal. 
-------------------------------------
 migchess20: considero debil este movimiento, creo que era mejor llevar el alfil a d6. aquí podias haber logrado un tablas. las posiciones de ambos era equivalente. la defensa india del rey la considero una apertura muy difícil, ya que es muy posicional. provoques the next 5 moves but unfortunately has a hole because... ...black intended to win back the bishop here but... ...the white rook can retreat and in the same time protect the bishop. so: always think tactical move chains until the very end! theratens mate on g7 and also the rook check on c8 is dangerous. there is only one way. and the c8 rook check is met with rd8. this skewer leads to the loss of a rook which is too much to continue. black resigned. 
-------------------------------------
a game i lost in the mini-tournament "king's indian april 2007". i also add annotations in spanish by migchess20. migchess20: 7...e6 esta es una mejor posicion , con juego equilibrado 8.ae2 exd5 9.cxd5 te8 10.e5 dxe5 11.fxe5 cg4 12.ag5 db6 13.0–0 cxe5 14.d6. migchess20: 8...ca6 es mejor el caballo a la posicion de a6. y mantener un juego equivalente 9.0–0 db6 10.e5 cd7 11.ce1 axe2. migchess20: 22...h6 la continuacion del peon a h6 es mejor para ahuyentar al alfil 23.ac1 tf6 24.tb1 taf8. migchess20: observemos como el poder del par de alfiles ejercen la posicion necesaria para ganar. a sacrifice to weaken the attack no black's king. migchess20: el rey esta muy debil, y es aprovechado por las blancas para ejercer su presión y lograr un gane. ? leaves the square f8 weak and loses the rook. or 32...rxf8 33.qxf8# migchess20: una ventaja clara para imponer su dominio y lograr un punto definitivo. 
-------------------------------------
based position for the tournament. my first choice, as it is the most efficient way to show that white intends to attack. i consider this move as a positive move, as black knight has already moved three times and was much more aggressive than my bishop. white has definitely more space and the only weakness (e4) is not in real danger attacking the pawn; let's eat what's on the menu opening the game, but the computer considers it as an inaccuracy black is now with the advantage of an open column. but white has lost his weakness and is a pawn ahead. this move was supposed to give some air to the queen. the computer does not say anything, here, but considers white loses its 0,50 advantage. not quite sure this attack is valuable. the computer sees it as an inaccuracy again. proposing the exchange, i guess. the queen is confined, now... though i saw this move as the completing one to enclose the queen, the computer does not give me a real advantage. mistake! the computer sees it well, but not wwgia. he could have played ng3, followed by 24. hxg3, then bxg4 recuperates the piece and win 2 pawns. mistake, according to the computer, but i am not convinced by his reasoning. the best according to the computer was here to take the knight and the bishop for a rook. probably the computer proposed the best solution as playing bf5, threatening many things. the computer consider this as a mistake. once again, its line is not convincing and he avoids my next move h7+ which i considered since the beginning of my attack, here. this may be the best shot of this game, if i can say that. i think this is decisive. i don't think king can take, as it exposes itself to a check "à la découverte", with a direct threat on the d7 bishop. i think this was the right move to play: avoiding more threat on the g column by refusing the g4 offer... threatening rh3, i guess. considering qg5 or qh6. the computer proposes instead bf5. it would eliminate a good defensor, but is it the thing to do? the pawn is now safe... this is of course a tragic mistake, but i am not sure bf5 -again- can save the day.  
-------------------------------------
pretty straightforward move. in always every situation where enemy king fianchettos, one easy way to attack there is through exchanging black bishops(be3 qe2 and to h6.) after doing that h4 moves effect will be much more powerful, you only not open your way to rook, but also give a place for queen to h6 early. simple tactic but effective. 8.h6 is quite good move too. imagine how annoying it would be for black. even i often hesitate whether going h6 or exchange, here h6 seems better choise. it may not make much difference but slightly better is hxg6 since its already weak anyway(h line). rook can get out later anytime. black should concentrate first getting his white bishop out, whích never moves durning the game btw. i'd rather avoid the cxd by d5, e6 gives no harm to your structure. this way you'll be left in enemy rooks meal box(11...nxe5,12.nxe5 12...rxf4  leaving pawn up)i understant this position is difficult to develop bishop so you gotta leave it to later,g5 and d2 are the only good spots but there is better moves to offer.------------------- f4 followed by f5 is one interesting idea. one thing you must also note is that you can still castle. it may be hard to admit, but your opening plan didnt work too well. this is the one big psychologial difficulty where it is hard to see such move. since you did manage to reach free way for your rook. you must still watch every position through different perspection. early castling is good for almost everywhere :) 11..nxe4!........ e4 pawn is still there. you've got some advantage now, thanks to blacks bad queen moves. f4 was good move for long but  move 17 was the best time to use it.(and then hidden check in move c5)  sometimes it may be bad idea driving queen away but for the most of the time it gives great advantage in development. 18.rxd5! 19..qf6 20.nxh7 another mind trick since its usually more safe to take with pawns pretty dangerous stuff. now need to be extra careful. 21.rxg7!! makes his sacrifice vain. and if king takes rook then bd5! rook e1 or something to cover bishop. game is pretty much over anyway. a good lesson might be that" positional eye can be deceptive" 
-------------------------------------
my favourite. here, as black, i would have gone for my dsb with nh5. this scheme provides me with nice settings, much less "attacheable" than c4 ones.  i've seen my opponen is not fond with the nh5 idea, but this is not to provide my bishop of a square to hide as to prepare a pawn storm.  thank you, just where i wanted you to be.  this is to unpin the f3 knight and to prepare h4. my queenside keeps closed. it is supposed to be the shield for my king, after o-o-o. good, preventing qc2 (nb4) just wait for me... :-) a little trap. he falls in it. this just helps me, opening the h column.  ...but this move was too juicy to delay.  now, the trap clicks. he cannot save the bishop, but my king is becoming very exposed, and castling appears very far.  nice attempt.  it was important for me to keep the queen active, and i needed it looking to h7. not with the rook, and not with the knight, because of nf3 needs protection. this also keeps my king out of the re8's action (as black, i would have played e5, probably).  i considered to shield with c4, but i didn't like b5. well, back to the e column. i thought that now e5 was almost the only black chance.  well, this is an exposed king. i am lucky the bd6 is untouchable, and cramps him a lot.  no, the f column should not be opened! i thought rxh7, and if kxr, qh1+, followed by qh6. but i wasn't sure it was enough.  bringing more firepower to the enemy's field.  he can now attack the f column, but without much effect.  intelligent. returning the exchange in order to free his position. now i have to be very "osé", if i want to keep my attack.  the nf6+ threat is very dangerous for black. his best answer is rg7, imo.  but he went greedy, and this is almost mortal. i could have gone rxr, kxr, qh1+, but after kg7 i couldn't see a clear win.  my queen returns! ...at the cost of a piece, but the presence of the first lady into the king whorts it.  qh8+ is not checkmate, though.  again, i have to play very strong to make my attack successful.  the nice one. tempo is all in chess.  i was in doubt if to follow with the queen or the rook. now, with more time, i realize that rh6+, kf5 (kf7, qf6+, kg8, rh8#), qf6+, kg4, rg1#, but on the spot i didn't. pity.  kf6, rg8+ and i win. now, i had to bring in the other rook, and get rid of defensive forces, so... tempo is all.  it is funny how long my queen keeps "en prise" undisturbed.-  kf7 loses to rg7#. so it worked, for once :-) 
-------------------------------------
the "losing" scandinavian nobody plays anymore. exd is better for white. this is not bad, of course, but white has to be very active to attack black's position. most people wouldn't do it.  threatens to exchange my lsb. i assume i will eventually lose this good bishop, but i can save it playing a3 to leave the a2 square for it. it is not necessarily a good plan, both are playable for black (imo). in such positions, black has to think about defending carefully and try to untangle armoniously his pieces, but in my experience black can succeed on this task.  i choose to keep my bishop. my opponent was near me in elo, so i didn't want to seem too "naive".  another try, more aggressive, is c4, hitting the centre. if black goes (say) c6, c5 blocks black, who is squeezed. or black can go for a tartakower-like system, replaying c5 to c4 by white.  the played move indicates my opponent is not willing to attack very quickly.  having moved the bishop to e2, i can play this with a strong probability my opponent won't play bb5+ now. not that this would be a terrible thing: black can perfectly hold against it, if he plays the correct moves for defence.  once again, my opponent acts carefully and passively. this is not by any means a bad move, of course.  standard developement.  another standard move. it blocks white's dsb sortie, due to qxb2. if the knight is not on g1, though, this pawn is poisoned: rg1 and rxb7, being black still far from castling, can be deadly.  another idea would have been qa5, threatening bxn and qxa8. doubtful... be3 is the standard answer here. the queen is not in danger, despite what it may seem. black is ok exchanging pieces, since he plays for equality, not for attack.  ...but, since white is going on with passive moves, let's put a little pressure on white's queenside. now, the lsb is valuable, and i can play this (instead of developing my dead kingside) because i can save it. white didn't play f4!, that is a "must" in this kind of positions for white to attack.  white helps me a lot with this move. but true is that he couldn't avoid to open the c file, somehow, so he correctly prefer this move that leaves c3 protected. and plans to take his revenge with bxc5, b4.  ...but white is, again, more passive than that. true is that the white n in b3 is very well placed.  ...so i play quickly to avoid b4 and, in case of ng3, white has to stop a4, rejecting it.  ...but then i decided this plan was too passive. this was a mistake. i had to keep my bishop, even if it meant to leave the knight trapped on his home square. i didn't like it at all, so i realized my previous plan was pure crap. ok. so, i'll act as if it all was part of a plan (sometime it works, and surely makes your opponent think a lot more :-))) (don't try it with good players!) of course. it deprives me of a very important piece and leaves his dsb the owner of the dark squares. but i didn't imagine (on a blitz) that it meant that the queen would be trapped (in the middle of the board, a queen!!!)  here it is. again, i had to act as if it would have been part of a plan :-d the only move to save the queen.  against any other queen move, white could have either trapped it or won a piece after d5, so this ugly place (it takes the good square from  the knight) is my move. could i survive? a bishop's storm is on sight. i cannot have my king exposed for what is to come... here he goes attacking. i cannot play b4 due to qxa5, but it's ok to fight for the column and reinforce b5.  do you want to play exchanges? of course, white is thinking in bc2, a nice move that is another reason for playing na7.  now, with this knight here, i defend a4, and now i can move b5.  upppsss! this was a blitz game. i didn't see it... now, it can help me, actually... now the threat is nxe5, and white must exchange queens, then rxa5, and black has a decent game. i can choose to go on with nc6 or try a risky move like rc2... victory. white's attack is half being rejected. now, let's prove our strenght.  freeing the f6's knight from the duty. now, looking for his beloved d5.  white should have tried d5, maybe. but this leaves me the nice spot... without almost thinking.  white thinks that after the rooks are gone, his bishop's pair will prevail.  but what bishop's pair? he plans to save it with qxq+, bxq? i don't want to exchange queen. with a pawn less, i have to keep pieces in order to create complications. the rooks allowed me to have my knight on d5, but now i don't get anything from the exchange but a knight in c8... white thinks that his dsb is more valuable than my knight. that can be true, but i know that in the endgame, a bishop's pair is a lot. and this looks to be a two sides pawns' endgame, for sure. no way.  now white has a very strong centre, but black can fight on the white squares, and the fry seems roughly even, or at least defendable.  maybe a mistake, but i had to prevent white to grab more space. white is not in a piece hurry... nor i am. with this move, i set free my queen to leave the defence of c8. anyway, white's queen penetration would be a problem, for sure, if left unattended. thank you, sir, you leave my bishop in its best place.  bxb would have been even. we both lose our best pieces, and his knight is more active than mine. qd5 is a trap, since it allows white queen's penetration on c7... so i had only one move. a risky one.  making white spend a tempo before retaking with the g pawn, having a supported defender for white central pawns.  an odd decision, since qc5 would have crushed me. to tell the truth, my game could have been destroyed in several occasions. this is not a good example about how to proceed in chess. but your opponent has to be smart enough to see all the implications.  let's see what happens in the endgame. my queen has little future, and the exchange provides me with tempoes and a single piece. a knight can be very poisonous, but i have to trust myself about being able to manage.  no fork in sight, so i can give my knight his most value.  now the position is equal, except for the pawn less i have. "ánimo!", let's go on... proving my assumptions, attacking.  wrong move. white must retire to nd3. this gives me a good chance to win.  now black can apply a strong pressure.  the point. white cannot move because black promotes...  another trick. if kxd6, nxb5+, followed by nc3, and his kings comes on time to attack mine and defend everything.  so i don't take it. he can't, i can't... no promotion here, but i will still win a piece.  white realizes he will lose a piece, there's no hope. even if the king takes back black's knight, the black king will take white pawns before white can support them, so the game is lost... the knight can escape... my opponent resigned. 
-------------------------------------
can you find the refutation? in this game i rather speculatively sacrificed the exchange, in return for threats to both white's king and queen - on both sides of the board. i couldn't see any defence. neither could my opponent, who surrendered material and lost quickly. post-match analysis showed the sacrifice to be unsound. perhaps against a stronger player i would have checked it out better and not played it. can you find the defence we both missed at the time? so my opponent opens with the reti (nf3), i grab space in the centre. this was reti's favourite, although king's indian reversed set-ups with d3 and/or g3 are common too. perhaps d4 is more aggresive, but black can end up with an over-extended centre, if he is not careful. the most common move in this position. i continue to develop. as does he. the most common move in this position this has to be played sometime, so there is no point in delaying. and the same goes for black. transposing into the catalan variation of the queen's gambit declined. this is the most commonly played move here. 7. qc2 is more common, but this is perfectly playable. 7.... qd6 is only the 5th most commonly played move in this position, but it had a good record. so white recaptures. 8.... qa6 is the only move in the world database on gameknot. 9. qb3 is the most commonly played move. black attack the pawn d4. now on the database, there are 3 games with 10. nc3 and one with rd1 - which looks the obvious way to defend d4 - stoer, andreas (2150) vs. lautner, josef (2126), which black one. ok, before reading on, consider what happens if black just takes the pawn on d4 now. why can't he take it? so why can't black just take the pawn on d4? the point is that after 10... rxd4, white has 11. nb5 attacking d4 and c7, and after rd7, which is the only way to meet both threats, white has ne5, attacking the rook again, with advantage. so now white has to defend it with a pawn. this is the parting of the ways. there were 3 games on the database with this position, rb8 ended in a black win in szymczak, zbign… (2355) vs. staniszewski, p… (2405), nb4 led to a white win in kristiansen, je… (2435) vs. ornstein, axel (2430) as did na5 in manor, ilan (2430) vs. rubinetti, jorg… (2445), so obviously i picked the one black one!
-------------------------------------
in the first round i was black against  paweł pityński, 1485, the tournament organiser, who i had beaten when i played in the same tournament in april. playing black i developed an attack on his king, which was wandering round the king-side. i forced him to sacrifice a pawn and the exchange. but he got back into it. he had a winning position, but we both became short of time and we reached an opposite coloured bishops ending which probably was drawn. so i wanted to win this one. incidentally this was reconstructed after the game. i think i have done it accurately, but it is possible that the move order is not correct.  queen's gambit. slav defence. the usual move. but this is slightly unusual. the most common reply. and so is this. so i also decided to develop my queen-side bishop outside the pawn chain. looking at the opening database now, i see that qb3 is more commonly played, and scores better. that is on its way... his knight comes out. so that if he takes on c4 i can recapture immediately with my bishop. he develops bf8. i am happy to exchange my "bad" bishop on the same coloured squares as my central pawns. he takes back. i copy his idea. he avoids the exchange. i see on the databases that black has played bxbd3, dxc4 or bg6 in this position. this seems to be a new move, according to the limited gameknot databases. i hit his bishop. he retreats. i attack b7 he defends. my knight advances before he exchanges and doubles my pawns. the bishop drops back. i take. unbalancing the position slightly. he correctly captures towards the centre. slightly ambitious maybe.... and now the position is unbalanced... i move my king to a safer square. he has the plan of attacking on the queen-side, which is what he should be doing. i take back. his queen-side expansion starts. bishop drops back. queen-side expansion again! while i dream of action on the king-side and centre. his nb8 finally moves. with the idea of discouraging c6-c5 he takes. i take back. he hits my bishop. bishop drops back, keeping the c6 pawn pinned against the rook behind it. he breaks the pin. still wanting to discourage c6-c5. he hits the queen. queen drops back. more preparation for c6-c5. this half pin on the d file discourages c6-c5 again. his knight seeks better squares. my king-side advance starts. and his queen-side action continues. i attack his rook. rook moves. i offer the exchange of queens. he turns it down. offered again. declined again. blocking c6-c5 once and for all. knight comes in. support for the rc5 trying to prise open a file on the queen side. so i block. h throws in a check. i thought long and had about sacrificing the rook for knight and pawn here, but evntually decided against it. and played this. one king move deserves another, but probably a mistake. i prepare to open a line on the king side. i am not 100% sure this was the move he played. rh8 instead stops what happens next and keep black in the game. i open a line. of course, not taking back with the g pawn, otherwise rxg7. now for my best move of the tournament. what did white play? did you find it? i think black is lost now. seeing that taking the bishop loses the queen he tries this. i take. king moves back. i take. now his rook was not on b7, as i remember he couldn't take on e8 with his queen he would have been mated by qxg7. he played this. i took this pawn. he took my bishop. i pinned his queen. he tries a counter-pin. but i take with check. he takes. i am mating now. he tries this, but... and this is mate. many thanks for reading, sorry i haven't reconstructed this game properly, but you get the idea! please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system.

so after a win in round 2 (see my last annotated game,) i eventually managed to win on time in round 3, so with 2.5 out of 3 i was paired against this guy, the tournament's strongest player, who went on to win the tournament outright with 4.5 out of 5, conceding a draw to the second highest ranking player in the last round. i was the third highest ranked player in the tournament, and so to lose the last two rounds and only finish on 50% was a bit of a disappointment, although the games are not sent for grading or anything. we both rattled out the first few moves. incidentally this was reconstructed after the game, and i am not 100% sure of the move order. reaching a standard king's indian position. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence as usual i play the sämisch variation, named after friedrich sämisch, who developed the system in the 1920s. this often leads to very sharp play with the players castling on opposite wings and attacking each other's kings. standard development. black plays the panno variation: 6...nc6, named after oscar panno, is a sharp and highly theoretical system which can lead to very complicated play. black holds back the c-pawn for the time being, and aims to put the knight on d4. the immediate plan is to prepare queenside counterplay with ...a6, ...rb8 followed by ...b5. the usual way of meeting it, so that if 7...e5 black can't play nd4. after 7. qd2 e7 8. d5 nd4! with advantage to black because if 9.	bxd4?	exd4 10.	qxd4?	nxe4 again the usual move. white prepares to play 0-0-0 in some variations. black is preparing b7-b5 should white castle on the queen side. opening up the diagonal for the bf1. taking advantage of the white knight moving away from e2. i played this quickly without thinking. i thought it was the standard move in this variation, but i see now that 10. d5 is more commonly played, and does get better results. he takes. i take back. he takes again. i take back. he is trying to open files on the queen-side. played with the hop of keeping the a and b files closed. he hits my knight. knight retreats. rook develops. i thought that i was developing the bf1 to an attacking post, but this may very well be a losing error. what does black play now? black also had an alternative in 15.....d6-d5 but it "only" seems to win a pawn after 16. be2 dxe4 17. 0-0 and fritz regards the position as plus .74 for black, and indeed, after a few minutes prefers 15.... bb7 as the second best move for black (+.77) while it regards the position as +2.37 for black after this move. now if i take the knight 16. fxe4 rxe4 and if i save the bishop on d4 with 17. be3 rxc4. so i thought that if he is winning the knight back anyway, i may as well take the pawn with check to maintain level material. so i take. he takes back. i threw in a check. i was rather surprised that he just didn't retreat the knight with a discovered check, but what he played was good enough. which was simply to retreat the king. firitz actually thinks this is the best move. i took his knight. i am not sure why he didn't simply take my bishop on d4. so i take back. this is in fact a mistake. black could have kept his deficit to managable proportions by just giving up a pawn and exchanging on g7 and then castling. threatening to take the e pawn and stopping me from castling. fritz prefers 19....rb5 or 19....qd5 protecting e4 and attacking the queen. what would you do as black now? again fritz prefers 20....bc3+! 21. bxc3 qxc3+ 22. ke2 be6 and black has a raging attack. and this is yet another mistake! best for white according to fritz is 21. qe3 bxb2 22. qb3+ be6 23. qxb2 qxc5 24. 0-0 and white is still in the game, a pawn down. fritz also prefers 22. qc1 he attacks my queen. i try to stay protecting my bishop, but.... and white has to give up the bishop. i would normally resign here, but at 25 minutes each, and no increment, who knows what may happen? i played it out quickly, until i was mated eventually. i the last round against jacek bylica i evenutally lost, trying too hard to win. thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two and rate this annotation on the star system. until next time dear reader!

kramnik, the defending world champion, scored a brilliant victory in the 14th and final game; peter leko resigned after 41 moves when faced with checkmate. this is only the third time in the entire history of the world championship that the defending champion has saved his title by winning in the final game. the game itself was a jewel of controlled aggression. despite consistent exchanges throughout the game, kramnik maintained an iron grip on the position and ultimately blasted his way into the black camp via the dark squares. taking no account of material sacrifices it was kramnik’s king that dealt the fatal blow when it marched right into the heart of the opposing position. this outstanding game, the best of the match, recalled the classic fifth game won by petrosian against botvinnik in 1963 when a similarly epic king march in an endgame brought white a classic victory. "i had to give everything, especially at the end, to win against such an opponent. peter leko is an incredible defender. for me it was more difficult than my match against kasparov in the year 2000", said kramnik after the game. leko said in conclusion: "it was a very hard fight. in the end, it was not enough for me to win the title. i'm disappointed, but i'm looking forward to the future. i'm 25 years old, and i hope to get a new chance to become world champion."   leko is not averse to repeating the main lines of the caro-kann. by contrast, kramnik must seek sharper paths. this move, favoured by nimzowitsch, tal and short, is ideal for a must-win situation, since it locks pawn formations and avoids premature exchanges.  nimzowitsch liked this 3 e5 variation and would play here 4 bd3. his most famous game with this line is sadly a loss, a magnificent manoeuvring game against capablanca from new york 1927. the most common alternative these days is 4 nc3, as played for example by kasparov in a drastic win over karpov at linares 2001, which continued 4...e6 5 g4 bg6 6 nge2 ne7 7 nf4 c5 8 dxc5 nd7 9 h4 nxe5 10 bg2 h5 11 qe2 n7c6 12 nxg6 nxg6 13 bg5 be7 14 gxh5 nf8 15 nb5 nd7 16 h6. the latest try for black is 4 nc3 a5!? as in sebag-chiburdanidze, fide wch women ko, elista 2004. black won in 33 moves after 5 be3 a4 6 a3 qb6 7 rb1 qa5 8 g4 bd7 9 bg2 e6 10 nge2 c5 11 0–0 nc6 12 f4 h5. this 4 h4 line was tested repeatedly in the tal-botvinnik wcc match, moscow 1961, with generally favourable results for black. the paths they followed are retraced below.  4...h5 may be preferable, after which tal tried 5 ne2 e6 6 ng3 g6 7 nxf5 gxf5 8 c4 c5 9 cxd5 qxd5 but only drew their 14th game from 1961.  instead 5 ne2 is possible and in their 20th game 5 e6 6 ng3 ne7 7 nc3 nd7 8 be3 bh7 9 bd3 bxd3 10 cxd3 h5 led to a marathon struggle and another draw. it looks more natural to retreat the bishop along the b1-h7 diagonal, but, in that case, black has to reckon with the dangerous pawn sac e5-e6. this looks like a new move. in the 10th tal-botvinnik game from 1961, we saw 6 h5 c5 7 c3 nc6 8 bh3 e6 9 be3 qb6 10 qb3 cxd4 11 qxb6 axb6 12 cxd4 na5 and black won in 42; while the 18 th game followed the course 6 c3 c5 7 bg2 e6 8 ne2 bb5 9 na3 bxe2 10 qxe2 cxd4 11 cxd4 bxa3 12 bxa3 nc6 and black won again. however, tal persisted with this line, and in tal-pachman, bled 1961, he finally won after launching an attack following 7... e6 8 f4 qb6 9 nf3 nc6 10 na3 cxd4 11 cxd4 o-o-o 12 nc2 kb8 13 bd3 nge7 14 rb1 na5 15 bd2 rc8 16 b4. black has one way to free himself before white's pawns begin to exert a fatal grip.  a small combination that regains his pawn, but at the cost of trading his dark squared bishop. 9...qc7 would doubtless transpose, but this is more forcing.  the tone of play for the middlegame is set -- black's position is resilient, but white has a promising future on the central dark squares. fritz now wanted to try the line-opening gambit 14...d4!?, but no human player would yet regard such drastic measures as necessary. (it's a mark of how far computer programs have advanced that fritz makes this dynamic choice.)  accepting some exchanges, but white's dark square grip persists. in contrast, 15 bxg6 gives black too much counterplay along the half-open f-file.  from now on, white's play is direct and brutal. i would have played bf1 and followed it with ke3. kramnik has no truck with such sophisticated nuances and goes directly for the jugular.  and here i would have left black's king's-side pawns severely alone and traded on d3. after 18...nxd3 19 kxd3 ke7 20 rc7 rab8 followed by ...rhc8, i believe black could withstand the onslaught from white, though it must be admitted that white's knight will always be superior to black's bishop.  19 g5 is possible instead, but kramnik is all for open lines.  an admirable display of energy, but, after 22...bxa4 23 rc7 bb5 24 rxb7 o-o, black reduces the tension and gains counterplay. taking the pawn could even be dangerous for white after 25 bxb5 axb5 26 rxb5 ra2+. for this reason, i prefer 22 ke3 restricting black's knight, and if 22...o-o then 23 rg5 g6 24 rcg1 ng7 25 h5! or if 24...kh8 25 bxg6! fxg6 26 rxg6 rf7 27 ng5 and wins. ? leko exhibits an alarming tendency towards a bunker mentality. after this passive move, black is strangled in the style of his hero petrosian or of nimzowitsch, the arch-blockader and early prophet of 3 e5 against the caro-kann. clearing the a-file merely offers white a further avenue of attack after 24...axb5 25 axb5 ra3 26 ra1!  creating a terrible outpost on c7 for his rook. black must prevent such an invasion at all costs. black has plugged one path for white's forces but more soon open. black, we soon see, is fatally debilitated on the central dark square complex.  passive defence is hopeless, so black tries to clear off as many white pawns as he can.   !! the decisive coup. white's small but highly efficient army is ready to concentrate its powers and deal the death blow. if now 34...rxd4, then 35 f5 exf5 36 e6 re4+ 37 nxe4 fxe4 38 rc7, threatening rxc6, and if 37...bb5+, 38 ke3 when black's b-pawn is doomed and white's king penetrates. the same theme. the way white's king now takes the black fortress by storm with just rook and knight against rook and bishop reminds me strongly of the epic king march and superlative conclusion of game 5 from the petrosian-botvinnik wcc match, moscow 1963.  black resigns since 41...ke8 42 rc8+ kd7 43 rd8 is 'mate. a jewel of a game and a sublime atonement for the sins of omission in some previous games of this match. now compare the celebrated king march by petrosian that doubtless provided inspiration for kramnik as he conducted his final onslaught. a wonderful game.

oh ho! really?? let's see what happens when i play ... ... the krejcik gambit! ...i don't know: technically this may not be the krejcik because that's a gambit against the dutch. by opening 1. c4 white keeps the option of playing his d-pawn to the 3rd rank, and with his bishop on g2 (buck-nekkid fianchetto though it may be), the opening becomes more like the english. if the t-crossers and i-dotters insist on the purity of 1. d4 f5  2. g4!? as the krejcik, then let's by all means call 1. c4 f5  2. g4!? the avocet gambit.  ;-) i might venture something cliché here, like  "so far, so book," but to tell the truth i'm not sure if there even *is* a "book" for this particular variation of this opening! every time i play the "krejcik/avocet gambit," i'm doing it mostly "by ear." at this point i'm already sketching plans to exploit the check on h5 and win black's weakling on d5. oh yes, there's my diagonal. ?! - this is actually not the best move, the result of my idée fixe about getting the queen check on h5. mo' nastier was 13. nf4! threatening both the scary fork on g6 and black's little soldier on d5. if 13. ...qf7 to stop the fork then 14. nd5 snags the button outright and black still can't capture on g5 because of rxh8. ...sigh. missing things like this otb is why i'm not a master. i certainly would have considered 19. ...bc6, opening lines. somewhat of a critical point in the game. black has weathered white's misplayed storm, and is a passed pawn to the good. white has better development and more active pieces but no clear attacking chances. ...what to do? well, first i want to truss up black's undeveloped rooks, binding them to a passive defense of his k-side pawns; then i want to quickly push my a-pawn in a minority attack maneuver to limit black's desire to push his own pawns on the q-side, and finally i want to start pushing my c- and d-pawns to make his life in the center miserable. to stop silliness like ...rg8-g2. black's king is cut off and both his rooks are now bolted to the floor until i feel like letting them go. time for phase 2. a little finesse: white now not only covers the black h-pawn, he also looks to the q-side from a distance. ! - suddenly white has a little sump'n-sump'n going on that draws the sting out of any plans black may have had for his q-side pawns. ? - not even pesky. ! - tempting white to exchange. ! - after 39. rg5?? black wins, having a passer on the h-file and being able to force one on the b-file. but now it's white who's looking good with all his pawns covered, while black's q-side pawns are weaker than kittens. what else? more accurate but not much more help was 42. ...kg7, to keep black's rook from going to the h-file. "conan! what is best in life??"  "to crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women!"    ...okay, maybe that's a little too over the top; but suffice it to say black's finished at this point. some chess giant once said, "the best move is not always the right move." this is one of those cases. the "best move" here is 49. ke6, but i wanted to provoke black into completely misposting his rook first. now black has lost his chance to check me - the point of my 49th move. too late. white forces a new queen after 51. ...kd8  52. rf8 kc7  53. d8=q+, so black resigns.

jusque là, rien de neuf sous le soleil ça par contre je m'y attendais pas ! il est 9 heures du matin et j'ai trop peu dormi cette nuit alors je commence par paniquer et je vérifie en relisant ma feuille de partie si je n'ai pas oublié ou interverti un coup. non : tout semble normal. c'est quand même dingue qu'au bout de 5 coups, dans un début que je joue maintenant depuis un sacré bail, je sois confronté à un pseudo-sacrifice qui va me faire perdre un pion ! si je reprends du roi, la dame fait échec en f6 et ensuite prend mon cavalier en ç6 et dans le tour de passe-passe mon pion f2 aura disparu...euh, attendez voir : mon cavalier en ç6...il vient de prendre le cavalier noir qui s'y trouvait ! donc, je vais perdre un pion mais gagner un fou en fait. je me disais aussi...c'est dur les rondes du matin mais apparemment plus pour mon adversaire quand même. on m'avait prévenu la veille qu'il arrivait presque toujours en retard et là il était à l'heure. il aurait mieux fait de traîner et de prendre le temps de se réveiller complètement.  pour dire comme j'étais réveillé, j'ai surtout joué ce coup pour organiser la protection du pion e4 et me développer. je n'avais même pas vu que la dame noire menaçait de prendre mon pion ç2 sur échec...  ... 8...d6?? bon, maintenant ce qui serait bien ça serait de réaliser le petit roque "à la main" comme on dit, en dégageant le fou de f1, en faisant passer la tour h1 au-delà de la colonne g et, pour finir en planquant le roi en g1. ensuite, je devrais pouvoir gagner des temps sur la dame adverse avec fou en b5 parexemple. et si je le faisais de suite...et c'est là seulement que je remarque que ça gagne la dame adverse...j'ai du bol car si la partie avait duré, rien ne dit que ce n'est pas moi qui aurait commis de telles bourdes.  fb5 (1h31 c'est bien la première fois que je gagne une partie avec plus de temps à la pendule qu'au début de la partie...) 1–0

esta bonita historia acontece en esos tiempos lejanos del ajedrez romántico, posbilemente en europa. un terrateniente, cuyo nombre se ha perdido en los laberintos del tiempo, tenía la particularidad de ser tan despiadado como buen jugador (al menos eso era lo que decía). para castigar a los campesinos que trabajaban en su tierra y, de paso divertirse, los citaba y obligaba a jugar, demostrando así su superioridad tanto económica como intelectual. las sesiones eran humillantes y cada vez más frecuentes. un día, llegó al latifundio un forastero. sin tener donde dormir, encontró lugar entre la peonada que supo compartir su pobreza con el recién llegado. la alegría surgió cuando  el visitante, agradecido por la hospitalidad, prometió que vengaría el buen nombre de estas pobres personas en el propio juego del abusivo. al día siguiente, el retador se presentó en la mansión del noble, quién, encantado de encontrar un retador, le dio las piezas blancas. antes de empezar, dijo nuestro jugador, le confesaré que no solo estoy dispuesto a ganarle, sino que me he impuesto una condición secreta que procederé a escribir.  debo aconsejarte que muevas los peones - dijo el noble mientras pensaba en el pésimo jugador que tenía en frente.  no me importa jugar sin enroque si ganaré de todas formas. que juegue dxe5 si desea. pensó el noble.  has perdido un alfil. pensar que un par de jugadas atrás creías que me podías ganar  y en este momento el noble se dio cuenta que su situación no era tan cómoda como le hubiera gustado.  nuestro jugador dio el papel al noble, que decía: 'tu tienes grandes riquezas, soldados y súbditos, pero de nada te sirve si te dejan solo. no solo daré mate con mis peones, sino que no me comerás ninguno. ellos, avanzando unidos, lograrán destronarte'.

as i was the challenger, i am black here not going for my favourite black opening, the french defence, this time... ruy lopez, my favourite as white, don’t really like having it played against me... development, less aggressive than 3... a6 the correct recapture castling  pinned down stopping a potential threat b4 ? this is not what i expected. tempo, maybe, but the pawns are still doubled switched sides! well, tougher than i thought  regaining material equally at this point we have reached a r+n+ps vs r+b+ps endgame smart ?? what meh huh? ??  no good moves left white resigns, forced mate. 
-------------------------------------
the classical variation (eco: e32) besides 9.be2 white could also consider 9.qe4. in this position 16.ne4 would break up black’s bishop pair while saddling him with an isolated c-pawn. white offered a draw at this point.  black declined only because he thought his bishop pair gave him an (albeit very slight) advantage…and white’s last move suggested he was unsure how to proceed. [?] black was fixated on achieving the typically favorable position of paired rooks on an oppo­nent’s second rank, but overlooked that he must separate his own rooks to do so, pin­ning his bishop to the rook on the d-file.  this would not be a problem if the bishop could be attacked by only a rook, but white’s next move reveals such is not the case.  he would have been better off playing to clear the rooks off the board with 21.… bd6 and seeing if his bishop pair could over­work white’s bishop and knight, though the symmetrical pawn structure suggests white’s offer of a draw was well considered.  now this move required preparation with 22.… ra1. as black resigned he quoted george bernard shaw, who suggested his epitaph read, "i knew if i waited around long enough something like this would happen." 
-------------------------------------
not long after i played this move, i regretted it.  white should play for a king’s indian reversed type formation with moves like 0-0, d3, nbd2 and eventually e2-e4.  4. ...	dxc4!  
-------------------------------------
 an excellent move by cm9k that anticipates the coming 7 ne3 and bolts down the extra pawn. i searched in vain now for a way to exploit the position of black’s queen, but i could not find an effective plan. this move acknowledges that i am unable to recover the lost pawn. i was hoping now to complete the development of my queenside and open up some files to bring pressure to bear on black’s queenside. 8. ...	cxb3 
-------------------------------------
 this move gives me some hope. 9k should retreat with 11…qc7, planning on finishing development with …bd5 followed by …e6. 12.bxc4  	nbd7 
-------------------------------------
 a bone-head move!!! i could have made life much more difficult for 9k by first denying black his right to castle with 14 bxf8 kxf8 and then playing 15 qb1. then, 15…qc7 16 qb4  kg8 17 rfb1 gives me very strong pressure on the queenside. 14. ...	bxa3 
-------------------------------------
 cm9000 is happy to trade a pair of knights. my only logical plan now was to drive off the well placed knight on c5 and that can only be achieved by forcing through the advance d3-d4. at least i am playing well in "bail-out mode" ... this move helps to break up black’s pawn structure. the position is starting to turn drawish, but there are some pitfalls for both sides to avoid. 28 dxc6 re2 29 rf1 nxc6 30 bxc6 qxc6 31 rxa5 leads to an equal position. i was still hoping for a miracle which explains the game continuation. the tactical justification of this move is seen in the variation 30 qa3 rc2! 31 rf1 ra2! and black wins material. 9k breaks the pin by counter-attacking my bishop on f3. i had to accept further simplification which brings us closer to a draw. 31.qxb4 	qxf3 
-------------------------------------
 my old friend centralization saves the day. black cannot make further progress thanks to the well placed position of the queen where it blockades and attacks the d-pawn. this rook will guard the f2 pawn while also taking aim at black’s vulnerable f7 pawn. this efficient combination of attack and defense assures me a draw. 37. ...	qd7 
-------------------------------------
 more petting myself on the back ... this move helps to restrain a possible advance of  9k’s kingside pawns. i did not want 9k to beat me to the punch by advancing his pawns and cramping mine. 41. ...	re5 
-------------------------------------
 white should play 9 f4! here, with the following ideas in mind.  first, if black plays 9…nxc4? white answers by 10 e4! attacking that knight and building up a huge center. that gives white a big advantage and a big initiative. black should on the other hand play  9…ng6! 10 bxf6! qxf6 11 g3!  
-------------------------------------
 and now, if black wants to stay out of trouble, he should send his knight on g6 on maneuvers with 11…nf8! intending nd7 to c5. the game continuation, on the other hand, leads almost to a strategically lost position for white. 9k is burdened with doubled, isolated c-pawns with nothing to show for it. 9. ...	d6 
-------------------------------------
 12.0–0 	0–0 
-------------------------------------
 after the exchange of the knight for bishop, white’s position goes from bad to worse. white’s bishop does not have much defensive value because its own pawns keep it away from contact with the kingside. 21. ...	bxb5 
-------------------------------------
 i need to set my kingside pawns in motion to apply maximum pressure against 9k’s passive position. as a prelude to that plan it makes sense to first improve the position of my king. kings can often play a very useful supporting role in the middlegame. the pawns are starting to rumble and there is little that 9k can do to ease the pressure. the alternative 30 bxe6 r7xe6 does not help white at all.  trading queens with 31 qxg6  kxg6 hardly eases the pressure. i can improve my position at will while white has almost no prospects of creating counter-play. by keeping queens on the board, i must be alert to a surprise check or unexpected penetration of the white queen.  31. ...	f5 
-------------------------------------
 after 34 bxe6 qxe6 i will force a breakthrough on black's e3 point. now, beside the game continuation nf8, i had a strong alternative in 34..f3, which cuts off support of the white e-pawn from his comrades and imposes a powerful, decisive cramp on white’s king position. 34. ...	nf8!
-------------------------------------
 i was sorely tempted to play 40...hxg4, but could not find a clear way to make progress after the reply 41 g3! which freezes my knight.  so, i went in for another plan to slowly build up pressure on 9k’s weak g2 pawn. 41.rb2 	rxg4  
-------------------------------------
 although a rook is a very heavy investment, i felt that the sudden exposure of white’s king and the prospect of obtaining two connected and far advanced passed pawns hurtling down the board just had to be worth the high price. white must accept the sacrifice. if 54 qb1 i could plant a rook into the heart of white’s position with the devastating 54…re3. 54.hxg3 	hxg3 
-------------------------------------
 the only alternative was 55 rf3, when i had in mind 55…rh5  56 kg1 rh2 57 kf1 qh5 58 rd2 rh1  59 ke2 rg1 and white is in serious difficulties. 55. ...	rg4? 
-------------------------------------
 sometimes, the most obvious continuation is also the strongest; i think black wins here after 55…rh5  56 kg1 rh2! - excellent move - 57 qf3 kg5! -that's a key move. now, 58 kf1 nh4 59 qb3 f3! , putting more presure over black's position, till it cracks, 60 gxf3 g2  61 rxg2 nxg2 and white cannot hold out much longer. 56.kg1 	qh5 
-------------------------------------
 and here i resigned. a very bitter defeat for me after i had skillfully built up my position to a crushing advantage. after the game, numerous spectators and kibitzer remarked that i had “gone nuts” with my sacrifice but it was my follow-up to the sac that cost me the game. at least the battle was entertaining! 
-------------------------------------
 this was a very pleasant surprise to me because it should lead to white’s domination of the center. a better move was 4…cxd4 which leads to conventional variations. 5.cxd5 	nxd5 
-------------------------------------
 also worth considering were 12 g3 or 12 g4 to play for bg2 and the quick capture of black’s cornered knight. but in that case, black would boast of 3 pawn and a rook vs two pieces - a very favorable material count for the second player. 
-------------------------------------
 a very important move. this pawn push removes the possibility of white playing bf4  and so stifles his development. after this move i went into “bailout” mode and where i was once playing to win, i now was playing to draw.   
-------------------------------------
 if white grabs the knight with 17 kxh1, he suffers from back-rank problems after 17…rgf8 19 bc4 rxf7! 20 bxf7 rf8 with the end result being that black recoups the lost material with interest. 17. ...	raf8 
-------------------------------------
 in hindsight i should have played 23 rf1 at once, although 9k has a strong continuation available in 23…re5 24 rf7 bf6! [better than 24…rxe3] 25 bf2 kd7! 26 rxh7 rf5 because the white rook is out of position. 23. ...	bc6! 
-------------------------------------
 25…bf6 26 bf2 kd7 is also good. 26.rxg7 	h6 
-------------------------------------
 white’s knight is totally dominated by black’s bishop here which pretty much kills all thoughts of meaningful counter-play. 28.g3 	kd7 
-------------------------------------
 bcm9k has made steady progress although a win is still far from definite. i'd love to exchange that lame knight for black’s active bishop here. if i could achieve that a draw would be a realistic possiblity. 
-------------------------------------
 i've just got to sit tight and keep black’s pawns under surveillance. sometimes you really have nothing better than to sit and wait for your opponent to come up with a plan. 37. ...	h5 
-------------------------------------
 this blunder effectively ends the game. there is still plenty of fight after 45 rxg4 rf2 46 rf4! rh2! 47 ke3 rh3  48 kd2 bh5! 49 nc3 bg6 50 ra4! rd3  51 ke1! now the point here is that 51…rxc3 is met by 52 rxa6  which wins back the piece and forces a likely draw. 45. …	rf4  
-------------------------------------
 cm9k now has a decisive 2-pawn advantage and is just coasting to victory. i played it out to the bitter end just to see how effective cm’s technique would be. 46.ke3 	ke5 
-------------------------------------
 with the exchange of rooks, there is no possiblity of creating counterplay and the pawns will just roll forward and stretch white’s defenses to the breaking point. white cannot set up a blockade and the knight is progressively stretched like a rubber band trying to hold back the two advancing foot soldiers. wow! this was a real wake-up call! i failed to keep the position under control and paid dearly for it. 9k displayed its usual tactical brilliance but i contributed to my loss by allowing the position to explode tactically. i had to put this game behind me and get a decent night’s sleep to be ready for tomorrow’s decisive final games. (0-1) 
-------------------------------------
this game is a little tale of the mobile pawn-center, and how much havoc it can do when it starts to roll. the sicilian o´kelly variation coming up. since i seldom play 1. e4, i had to read some books before the next moves :) a weakness or a useful move? it gives the king a "breathing hole", but more important: it keeps the black knight out of g4 harassing the white bishop on e3. a phase where both players tries to find the best squares for the pieces. looking at the mobile pawn-centers, the important difference is that white has advanced one more square than black. moving the bishop from defense to attack, and thereby helping the coming pawn-roller. freeing d3 for the queen with a mating attack in some variations. ?! i did not quite understand this move. the black knight leaves the defense of the square h7, and with my next move both knights are stranded on the back line, making my center pawns even stronger. exchanging the pawns on d5 would give white a clear edge due to the "anchor" pawn on d5 and a lot more room for future operations. on the other hand, now the full force of the mobile center begins to show. threatening mate in 2, so black has to weaken his king side. sometimes in chess the pawn is the strongest piece! the black queen doesn´t have a reasonable place to go. 21. ne2, qb6 22. be3 was my first choice, but looking deeply into the position, the knight move seemed even stronger. 23. - kf8 might be a bit better, but white simply continues: 24. nxc8 with the threat of playing the e6 pawn to e7  and promotion to a queen on d8. black is down with a piece and a pawn - and with no tricks in hand. the rest is easy. and 1-0.  
-------------------------------------
 {a plain silly move. i am reasonably sure, most of blacks win in the caro-kann stem from white players becoming impatient and ruining their position without need. bxc7 would have been enough for whíte to gain some play. as a matter of fact, i can't even say what exactly i missed. somehow, i was under the impression, i would have the time for d5.}  {objectively, this makes things just worse. but then again, qxc7 would be the immediate admission of defeat} q:f4 is also good, but i decided to make the board simple
-------------------------------------
the slav, which was the main theme of the recent match, kramnik-topalov. white chooses the gambit-line - a very sharp continuation. black holds on to his extra pawn on c4, but white gets a nice centre. according to a book by markov and schipkov - "winning with the slav" - this move prevents a knight-move to g5. but does black have the luxury of this kind of moves in the opening? i don´t know, it just doesn´t look right. but i decided to follow the book. a strong move, keeping the initiative. now the main line goes: 10. - be6 11. be2 nc6 12. 0-0 bd5, and black is fairly okay. the book had another suggestion though - and unfortunately i decided to try it. the idea is: 11. nd2 a5! 12. qf3 ra7! when white is in greater danger than black. alternatively white could continue with: 11. d5!? bg7 12. d6 nc6 13. qd5 bd7, but black is still okay. (!) a very natural and good refutation of blacks opening play! the queen attacks b5 and has an eye on the good square e4. i have simply lost too much time with the moves h6 and g6. now whites centre-pawns comes rolling, and blacks pieces are totally un-coordinated. here already, i had the feeling it would be a short game ... forcing the bishop away from the defence. rooks on b7 and h7! it looks more like a joke than good opening-preparation. desperately searching for some kind of counter-play, but the pawns on d5 and e6 are simply too strong. enough is enough ... i can´t recall ever having had such a bad position after only 22 moves, but at least i learned a lesson: opening-books are not flawless! 
-------------------------------------
this game evolved from a rather rare line of the sicilian to an extremely complex middlegame - and ended up with an "objectively drawn" endgame with opposite coloured bishops. unfortunately these kind of endgames are seldomly played out - because there are still a lot of tactics involved. but let´s start with the beginning...  the accelerated dragon is not seen very much at master-level these days, but it is still a fresh alternative to the bulk of theory of the more common sicilian lines. gm lothar schmid played some interesting games with black back in the sixties and seventies. we are at the crossroads of theory. white can opt for the maroczy with 5. c4, which is linked with the english opening, or go for 5. nc3 - the so-called classical. this line can even lead to the more orthodox dragon. of course there are other moves, and my opponent prefers one of these. but it just leads to a transposition in a few moves. (!) this is the critical test of the line, according to a specialist in this opening, gm heine nielsen. black has no tricks with a queen move to b6, and white prepares an attack on the king-side with f2-f3, qd2, 0-0-0 and h4. black has other ways to go though, and i chose to try a fianchetto of the other bishop too. this leads to a very open game. (!?) a very aggressive move! i had expected 9. f3 to limit the "bite" of the comming bishop on b7. black needs to react in the centre immediately, and the time is just right since white hasn´t castled yet. (!) white brings his king to safety, but it will cost him a pawn. at the moment this is not so important, since there are lots of attacking possibilities on both sides and in the centre. i must admit that i felt like walking into a battle-field more or less blinded by smoke from the gunfire :) this is the kind of position i would hate to have in a blitz-game - even with a pawn up! of course the black d-pawn is strong, but white has plenty of play around it, and the final question could be: which king is the safest. i decided to seek for simplifications instead. the obvious threat of bh6 (hitting both queen and king on same diagonal), gives black time to put a rook to a more active position - the cover of the d-pawn. hoping for a queen-swap, but my opponent rightly tries to get it under the best conditions. please look at this position. i must admit it took me ages to analyze it - but it leads almost forced to an endgame with opposite bishops and black a pawn up! whites problem is the lack of communication of his light pieces and the threat of mate on the baseline. without these tactics, black would have been out of ammo, with only a handshake left... after all the fighting this is an esthetically beautiful position: two bishops left right beside each other - and ready for a very different kind of game. i am no expert on endgames (but i love to play them!), and my opinion around here was: probably a draw, but with pawns on both sides, black has chances. first: get a passed pawn on the king-side. my opponent plays very skillfully in his attempt to take out the venom of the pawn-majority. without the bishops this would lead to an easy win, but having the opposition of the kings dosn´t do much here. it may sound strange, but blacks win is where his pawn-minority is right now! that should explain the next moves. with the aim of changing to the more active diagonal a7-g1. the classical theme of 2 pawns controlling 3 - but still: with opposite coulored bishops the draw is always terribly close. controlling the white squares and the black pawns on the kingside, it is hard to see how this can be anything but a draw. i decided to leave my kingside-pawns to their own destiny and go for the other flank. (!) a crucial moment - and a great trap by white. the "automatic" move 46. - kxc4?? will be refuted by 47. kf3 followed by eg. bb5 and a rock-solid draw, since white has build a fortress on the light squares. maybe i am wrong - but i don´t have fritz to prove it... nevertheless, it became obvious that the c-pawn helps black to win, because it blocades whites bishop if the a-pawn goes. the next move is therefore both simple and decisive. white resigned. after 47. bxg2 kxa4, white cannot stop the a-pawn without giving up his bishop. a very inspired game by both players, if i may feel free to say so. 
-------------------------------------
una mossa strana, ma visto che in passato il gm francese eric prie l'ha giocata in diverse occasioni, ottenendo anche buoni risultati, se non corretta è perlomeno giocabile. ho letto un consiglio su come affrontare simili mosse in apertura: evitare di perdere tempo a cercare una confutazione che spesso non c'è e pensare a sviluppare i pezzi. questa invece qualche difetto deve averlo. il mio obiettivo è effettuare la spinta c6-c5 che però toglierebbe il sostegno al pedone d5, quindi con questa mossa voglio eliminare il cc3 che attacca d5. sempre per sostenere la spinta in c5, inoltre butta un'occhio su b2 alla fine il bianco è riuscito a utilizzare in modo utile questo cavallo, ma ha mosso tre volte questo pezzo oltre al tempo speso per spostare l'alfiere da f4 per fargli strada. lo stesso obiettivo forse si poteva raggiungere con la semplice cg1-f3-h4xg6, spendendo qualche tempo in meno se il bianco avesse giocato 16.b2-b4 per ostacolare la spinta in c5 sarebbe seguito a7-a5. troppa preparazione, era meglio spingere subito in c5, perché ora che le torri bianche sono in comunicazione e quella in f1 può portarsi in b1,  la replica a7-a5 a b2-b4 non è più così efficace. il bianci perde l'occasione, b2-b4 era senza dubbio la mossa migliore meglio un po' più tardi che mai. ancora un'imprecisione da parte del nero. se si vuole lasciare al bianco di cambiare in c5 allora il posto di questa torre è in e8, dato che dopo 19. dxc5, axc5; la pressione su e3 e lungo la colonna "e"  creano problemi al bianco. così il nero si è creato una maggioranza sul lato di donna. ora l'obiettivo è metterla in moto.   come minimo il pedone a4 è condannato. 26...tb4; 27. a5 tb5 e il pedone cade ma il nero perderebbe lo slancio. mantenere la pressione e sfruttare la forza dei pedoni avanzati penso sia più importante che andare a caccia di un pedone che tanto non scappa. un errore. si poteva tentare 29. e5 cui sarebbe seguito ch7 ( o cd7 ) con l'obiettivo di portrlo in f8 da dove impedirebbe un'ulteriore spinta del pedone "e" che potrebbe offrire del controgioco al bianco. un pedone in settima che incatena le torri avversarie è un ottimo risultato. il materiale è ancora pari ma è questione di poco. per dare aria all'alfiere. per disperazione. il bianco abbandona, seguirebbe ...tc1 
-------------------------------------
bird's opening - featuring mate with bishop and knight. transposition to some closed sicilian is quite common. both e6 and g6 does not feel right. [12.kh1 sg4 13.lxg7 kxg7=]  [12...sxe4!? 13.lxg7 sxd2 14.sxd2 kxg7]  17.- a4!? seem troublesome for white. definitely =. [18.e5 se8±]   [21.e5 se8]  [23...dc7!?=]  ?!  [27.fxe5!? fxe4 28.sxe4±]  ?
-------------------------------------
ruy lopez. ruy lopez. old steinitz defence. nimzovich attack. i have already won a pawn. white castles. but black have several moves left before being able to castle. queenside castling is out of question for black, because of the queensides destroyed pawn shield. a tactic. white has a slight advantage. rook and two minors against two rooks. white also is one pawn up! it will be a very interesting endgame! endgame with two minors vs. rook. white have also a pawn more. interesting! white is clearly better. but some work still left before winning. an active king is gold worth in the endgame. the strength of the king is approximately as a minor piece. another pawn less for black. my first good move in the whole game. sac my knight for blacks last pawn. no risk that black is queening in the future.  now it is my king, bishop and three pawns against my opponents king and rook. also my king is located perfect in the area of the queening squares. i will win, if i not blundering the game away. locating my bishop better and also gives space for my a-pawn to advance. it´s no hurry. another nail in blacks coffin. black gives up. this was a fun game. nice to win against a 1800+player also!

-------------------------------------
this game is interesting if only for the queen sacrifice that forces checkmate.  most comments are useful for non-experts and there are no comments about opening strategies. prevents white getting control of the centre of the board with e4 this seems like a pointless move at this stage.  neither important for defence nor does it develop any pieces enables development of bishop and black to castle quickly still white has not developed any pieces and seems to be weakening his defence develops bishop and is now ready to castle this move protects white’s rook from the potential threat of black’s g7 bishop.  (it would only take black to force a move from the a4 pawn to leave a knight move uncovering an attack with possibility that the knight could simultaneously attack or take another piece.) allows the c8 bishop to develop and prevents the a4 pawn advancing which would have prevented black’s b8 knight from moving to c6. defends the a4 pawn and allows white to develop f1 bishop usually a good idea to castle early without letting the opposition gain control of the centre of the board. although this gives the bishop options it seems a slightly wasteful move – is it not better to develop the knights or at least pieces of value (i.e. the other bishop) – so far out of 6 moves 5 have been pawns! this allows the night to move to c6 without getting attacked by the bishop yet another pawn move without developing any pieces!  this is really weakening white’s defence without showing any signs of an attack bold if not pointless move!  why didn’t black just develop the knight?  black thinks if the white pawn attacks the bishop it doesn’t matter because he can then attack the white rook on h1 as expected as planned black had not planned for this as there’s no way of preventing loss of the bishop.  on the plus side, white’s defence and pawn formation is a shambles with the king wide open and nowhere to develop pieces! this is whites 9th move and the 8th pawn move! not worried about losing the bishop - this puts the queen within 1 move of forcing the white king to move without castling.  also nxe4 would be a big threat.  the only way black could prevent this with ne2 but this would mean black could do bxf3 useful move because it enables fxe4 without leaving too much of a threat from nxe4 after qg3+ white still wants 12 fxe4 followed by nxe4 so develops the final knight which is better placed back up the knight on e4 white makes a well judged choice not to take the bishop with the pawn for reasons previously explained and instead attacks the bishop with the knight. a better move was nc3 because it means that after 12... bxc2 13 qxc2 is possible black is best off taking the pawn forcing the white king to move and preventing both develoment of the g file knight if bxf3 only move queen moves back in order to enable an attack on the king an attempt to move the knight to a4 - a threatening position finally moves the second knight in an attempt to help defend the king as planned this forces the black knight to either retreat or take a piece. black opts to take the bishop because it forces the king to move into a position that could potentially be attacked by the g7 bishop - a tactic that paid off - wait and see! this prevents the knight from moving to a5 and enables either the a or c pawn to advance needed to protect the b6 pawn - black chose not to advance the b pawn because he wanted to move the a or c pawn forward this puts the rook in a powerful position and prevents the c pawn from advancing successfully, the pawn is defended by the black queen as planned taking the pawn would have left the white king in trouble so the best move under the circumstances very good move - it may leave black a pawn down but remember the bishop on g6 and the position of the black king this is exactly what black wanted may have been better to use the rook to take the pawn and certainly would have been better to move the king to safety but white was worried about the c pawn advancing again and attacking the queen white in serious trouble and about to lose a rook for nothing and probably wishes the f1 bishop had moved the knight simultaneously attacks the queen and the rook and the queen is unable to protect the unprotected rook probably the best possible move under the circumstances - attacking the black knight (who isn't bothered) why wait? white needs to bring the bishop into the game but first decides to move a pawn... who knows why? time to bring the knight back into the game and into safety bad move! the bishop was protecting the pawn on b5 the b5 pawn is gone attacks the d5 pawn with bishop and queen which is only protected by the black queen black hopes white takes the d5 pawn so that 29... rb2+, 30 nxb2, rxb2+, 31 ka1, rd2+ wins black the white queen for a rook good move! white is wise to the threat of rb2 attacks e3 pawn and hopes white moves e4 so that he can move the knight to d4 hooray white did what black wanted as planned - enables rb3 to be followed by qxa3 checkmate.  rb3 previously would enable white to swap queen for 2 rooks (2 rooks are worth more than a queen) excellent defensive move.  puts a stop to blacks plan... now how can black go back to the original plan of rb2? this is not a blunder - black wants white to take the queen with the knight and it's game over! woohoo! only possible move whatever piece white chooses to take the knight with loses the game 
-------------------------------------
this game was very exciting. at each move i was looking forward to what my opponent would have done. i don't know if it is tactically brilliant; but it was exciting to explore the different tales which the chessboard could tell, depending on each move. the closed sicilian is somehow not very popular. the black can be comfortable, and probably the best line is 2. nf3, or 2. c3; but it's a very sharp and extremely entertaining opening. classic position. i was more used to 9. nd4, 9. ... a6 and 9. ... rb8. the point is probably to defend c5 in order to advance in d5, but the black must be careful with that diagonal. seemingly this is a book move, so i won't protest about that. the queen might choose d2, however if the black plays d5, he threatens d4, and one must think of a good position for the bishop. this might be d2. moreover, i can choose to play: 10. ... d5 11. exd5 exd5 12. bd2 re8 13. rf2 nf5 14. re2. unexpected. the bishop leaves the diagonal unguarded to pin the d-pawn. i would have played 10. ... d5. this might come somewhat unprepared, especially because the black is about to play d5, and then there will be less chances to attack on the side. however, i needed a bit more space to maneuver, and i played qe1 to use the e1-h4 diagonal, after all! is that fear i see in 11. ... f5? 11. ... d5 was to prefer. usually one takes with g. in this particular case, however, i couldn't wait to boast my bishop with a longer diagonal. the nc6 is pinned. i think that taking by e eliminates one weakness. i have no interest in taking in f5 at the moment. e6 is a more attractive target. it has become *the* target. well, this was truly unexpected. i thought the nc6 was pinned. the white shouts his skepticism to the black's chances to checkmate before entering the endgame. 15. ... nxc2 16. qxe6+ qxe6 17. nxe6 rxa8 18. rc1 is just about the same, but with some pieces swapping (not good for the black). yes, the 10th move wasn't that great. the situation is getting complicated. it may be hard to believe, but the square e1 must be available for the king! the big threat of the black now is dc6-g2#. from g3 the queen controls g2. however, qf2, which also controls g2, cannot be played, since the black would threaten mate in h1. the black spotted another weakness: the e2 square, where the knight might fork the royal couple. kf2! i thought this move deserved an exclamation mark when i played. the computer does not agree and proposes:  18. gxf5 ndxf5 19. qg4 bd4+ 20. rf2 ng6 21. re1 re8 22. nce4 rf8 23. a4 bxf2+ 24. nxf2 e5 25. axb5 exf4 26. bxf4 nxf4 27. qxf4 qxb5  i don't know. for the moment kf2 solves the problem of the fork, but even more importantly, it prepares rg1. without a counterattack, the black is bound to open the lines and slaughter the white soldiers! the computer is unhappy again: … h6 19. nh3 nf3 20. g5 hxg5 21. be3 b4 22. nd1 g4 23. ng5 nxg5 24. fxg5 kf7 25. bd2  the point of e5 is opening new lines. however, this might have been more effectively prepared with rf8. you have to think that at each move the threats b4, qc6, e5, d5, rf8, must be accurately calculated... the risk is terribly high! pins the knight and poses an immediate threat to h7. the knight has found a strong square. the most important feature of the e4 outpost is that the black must fear nxc5, threatening the queen. activity! the white king is boldly walking around, but two black pieces are pinned! the computer suggests 23. nb1 exf4 24. c3 bxc3 25. bxc3 kh8 26. qg4 be5 27. na3 qe6 28. qg6 qxa2 29. bxd4 bxd4+  but i don't see the advantage of pointing to a3... mabe this was too bold... 24. c3 was more precise -- but much less fun!! the white looks forward to freedom, but now it will be hard... i had only considered 24. ... d5 and 24. ... be4 (which i thought the best for the black). anyway, the nf5 is free now. the threat is very simple: 24. ... be4. nf5 blocked once again! the black feared the worst. however, this was the time to open the lines with bxe4. now he will have to defend himself. better late than never. this is retreat. bxe4 was still better, after all. i actually feared 27. ... ne5, to which i thought to reply 28. bxe5 nxe3+ (but also qxe5) 29. kxe3 qxe5 threatening 30. ... d5. all is lost for the black. after 29. … nd4 30. qxe6 nxe6 31. nxf7 nxf4 the white is two qualities up anyway. the white calls the last forces to arms. 32. ... nxg7 33. qxe3 qxe3+ 34. kxe3 was probably better. the black resigned. for me, it was a very beautiful and rewarding game. 
-------------------------------------
queens gambit declined. castling is preferable almost always.  fianchetto. can´t take blacks knight with my c3-knight, if i do black retakes with the pawn, and are forking my queen and f3-knight. what? this sacrifice seems not so convincing? of corse, and then will queen h4 follow! but i escape! another pawn for the bishop, and soon will probably rook f6 follow. with pressure against my f2-pawn. natural defense move by white. surprise! soon white got a counter-attack. was not so good of black to push his f- and g-pawns. suddenly white delivers checkmate! the big mistake of black in this game was apparently his pushing of the f- and g-pawns in front of the king. better had been rf6 earlier in the game! 
-------------------------------------
i started with d4.  queens gambit. one of my common openings. it´s pretty even! i have heard that a player must castle within seven moves. now at move 11 my opponent castles! but i´m even later to castle! centralizing the rook! think this exchange was a little bit favorable for me. pressure against e4- pawn and nc6. increasing the pressure along the c-file. black is swapping quenns. takes with the rook of course! keeping up the pressure along the c-file is necessary! doubling the rooks! increasing the pressure at the c-file. a free pawn. centralizing the king is a good strategy in the endgame! nearly the only move that makes sense in this position. going with my free pawn. a tactic! wins back the rook! now have i get the advantage with two connected, passed pawns! can´t go away to far with my king. must guard the black king side pawn majority.  my plan was ...fxg4 and white has three connected, passed pawns against blacks two. white have then the possibility to block blacks two passed pawns with his king! ??? strange move??? now have white blocked blacks two passed, connected pawns. they can´t do any more damage! whites three connected, passed pawns is far stronger! as i see it two connected, passed pawns can pretty easily be blocked, if the king is in the neighbourhood and no other threats is  possible, but three connected, passed pawns is probably one too much for the opponent to grasp! the future is looking bad for black! he can´t do anything more productive than go back and forth with his king! black gave up!  
-------------------------------------
  this is a questionable maneuver, the black bishop has been driven to a more useful diagonal by a pawn charge which has no sustainable attack. it would appear that black is preparing to launch an attack aimed as disrupting white’s central pawn structure ? forces white to tie up either the queen or the bishop or lose material black now has a very strong king side attack whilst white’s queen is tied to the knight and cannot assist in the defence. white has given the only active piece on the king side and allowed black to half open the file in front of the white king. ?
-------------------------------------
 in breaking the knight pin white has trapped his king’s rook
-------------------------------------
this is a league match, when i was challenged my opponent was around 200 points north of my rating so i was expecting a tough match and that is what i got. i've recently played in a kings gambit tournament with mixed results however i really enjoyed it so i thought i would give it a go here. i was hoping it would take my opponent to less secure territory this is the bishops gambit variation bishop's gambit, bogolyubov variation this is a mistake the bishop limits the options for the black knight which is sidelined for the rest of the game, the white lsb is a little more fortunate. this is a blunder, the computer suggests 16. qxd8 raxd8 17. ng5 nxf4 18. rxf4 bh5 the computer calls this a mistake preferring  … ne6 19. qf5 kh8 20. rh3 g6 21. qg4 ng5  however in compensation the computer calls my next 3 moves mistakes best is  20. nf4 nxf4 21. qxf4 qe7 22. rbf1 rad8  around this point i started to feel that i had totally lost any grip i had on the game and that i was just being hounded around the board. i looked again and realise that i had the potential for a lot of pressure on the black king, particularly based around the f7 square so i started to put a plan into action in the hope i could do better than lose. computer prefers  21. nd3 rae8 22. e6 kh8 23. rh3 bxa3  according the the computer this is the last of a sequence of mistakes on both sides i need to try to eliminate the black dsb as i am looking to get my queen or a rook onto the 8th rank and it seems to be one defender too many for me to get through. if it's not moved then i will get the added benefit of doubling black pawns and isolating the a pawn which could be useful if we get to an end game the computer says this is an innacuracy preferring 23. nxc5 re7 24. e6 f6 25. nd7 rd8 26. rh3 nb7 the computer calls this a blunder, as i see it, it doesn't really achieve much. the threat on my queen is not really there. this is a blunder as the rook is now pinned which also limits the options for the rook on f8. the computer suggests … kh8 25. qxg6 re3 26. rxe3 bxe3 27. qe6 bd4 i was not clear on my best option here, i wanted to take with my lsb but in the end i figured that this was more forcing. the computer calls this a blunder and proposes mate in 7 which i will leave as an exercise for the reader this is a blunder as it's not part of the mate in 7 routine however i had now regained all the material i had lost earlier and was sure i could gain some more. the computer prefers … qxf7 27. rxf7 kxf7 28. nxc5 nf8 here finally it's time to get rid of that pesky bishop, black is in real trouble now, the knight can't be taken due to qe8+ though the computer declares mate in 12 here and black resigned.  i was delighted with this game but think i had a very lucky escape. i started badly then a series of blunders in the middle game on both sides threw it into some disarray and i was able to improve the co ordination of my pieces to apply a lot of pressure around the black queen 
-------------------------------------
black opens with the french. ? i play the advance variation in the french defense! maybe not the best move, according to gameknots own database. better was nc3 or nd2! a very common pawn-push in this and similar positions. black tries to attack the base in whites pawn chain, here the pawn at d4! my standard response to c5. all other alternatives i´m seeing as weaker, with the risk of getting a weak pawn and all such drawbacks! a very weak move according to the gameknot database! giving me a somewhat easier play. better was nc6 or qb6!  now comes nc6! at this point, i had a pretty good game, maybe even some slight advantage? ? maybe was it better to continue development with bd2 or even 0-0 ?   now i´m castling kingside.  continuous development. now is it time to come up with some kind of plan for the middlegame! chasing the queen away! it´s also seen as good strategy to centralize the rooks in the beginning of the middlegame! aiming towards the kingside with my light-squared bishop. ? maybe not the best if black plans to castle kingside? but maybe has black other plans? castling queenside was maybe blacks best option here, because he had weakened his pawn shield on the kingside. it´s also possible that black plans a pawn storm on the kingside!  it don´t look like black want to make a pawn storm on my kingside after all? now is blacks pawn shield in front of the king to some extent weakened! not very good! i have heard a theoretical wisdom that if the center is locked, you can advance with your pawns in front of your king, without too much risk!  swapped knights! best to defend my g4-pawn! now have i defended my kings camp successfully, at least for the moment! black tries to increase the pressure! probably the best defense move? a little miss there? the pawn is actually undefended ! my bishop swallows the pawn with good appetite! threatens my h3-pawn ! threatens my bishop and also increases the pressure on the f-file ! locking it up a bit ! i made a proposal to change queens! think that i have some advantage now, a defended free pawn and all that, so it made a point to try to reach an endgame here! black refused to change queens! wins another pawn! the game has changed to some kind of slow manouvering with the goal to step by step slowly placing the pieces better! i think that´s named positional play? a positional sacrifice! i wasn´t clear if this would winning, but it felt right ! and black can´t defend his e 4-pawn ! black are trying to make counter-threats! in this case against my f 4- pawn! must defend it with my rook ! i tried to reorganize a bit! a little pointless , perhaps? don´t think that this king walk to the center is good for my opponent ? seems too risky in my opinion. planning c 4 check! defence move against the check! the e4 -pawn will fall with havoc in blacks camp ! wins  a pawn, but definitely not the game! disastrous for black, this move! checkmate. a happy ending for me in this game! i was especially proud to win against a player with over 1600 in rating! 
-------------------------------------
hello chessfriends! want to annotate this game, i won against a 1650 rated player, not so usual that i do this! nothing particular with the opening, yet! king´s pawn opening. think the game is even, at this point! ? better was nxd5 or be7! ! now can i destroy the pawn shield in front of blacks king! maybe it was better for black to sac his rook and get his king out of danger as soon as possible? now i must come with my queen to blacks kingside as soon as possible! threatening with tempo! chasing away blacks lightsquared bishop makes it easier for me! a pretty good move. threatening qg3+ ! qg3+. seems to getting worse and worse for black! the only move. but not good enough? nxg6!! and it´s not possible for black to save the game. black gave up!

6:e vanligaste draget med 37-30 till vit. 2:a vanligaste draget med 33-35 till svart. vanligast är 2. nf3 med 37-28 till vit. ut ur worldbook, men draget är i botten på amatörboken som 17:e alternativ med 100 % till vit. +0,62 ut ur teorin, där 3. e4 varit enligt boken med 100% till vit. +0,52, och 3...f5 hade varit gnuttan starkare. +0,52 och bästa draget i den positionen. tar befälet över centern. +0,71 där 4...f5 varit bästa drag. +0,54 +0,77 +0,43, där 6. bd3 varit starkare. +0,64 och svarts näst bästa drag. 6...f5 hade varit gnuttan starkare. +0,35 och inte särskilt starkt. 7. h3 hade varit starkast med +0,64 i utdelning. +0,92 och en aning förhastat. svarts bästa drag är fortfarande avancemanget av f-bonden till f5. +0,72 +1,83 och vit får tid att utveckla sig och förbereda rockaden. här borde jag observerat b4, och täckt upp det hålet med a3. men en rockad är inte fy skam ändå, och det står +2,12 +2,54 och starkare hade 10...nge7 varit med utveckling i fokus. +1,16 ett uselt drag, och 11. a3 eller rb1 hade varit betydligt starkare. +1,07 och jag får dansa fram och tillbaka med min l. +0,92 och jag vill få upp mina trupper. -0,17 och jag hade vunnit mer mark om jag slagit med bonden fxe3. vill jag iväg svarts d här, så något optimistiskt förbereder jag det med a-bonden. -0,23 -0,18 -0,18 utjämnat läge -0,02 det bästa draget i den här positionen, och fortsättningen är något oklar. svart öppnar upp positionerna, och det är vit som tjänar på det +1,38 +1,00 och vit har initiativet igen. svart går åt fel håll, men jag ser inte det omedelbart och missar därför att gå upp med qa4. så det blir endast 1,00 till vits fördel. äntligen, och det här ger ett gott övertag på +4,71 +7,62 men jag velar för mycket och missar det vinnande 23. nd5 +1,10 och jag är för orutinerad för att se kombinationerna så snabbt som jag borde. +0,45 och mitt överlägsna övertag (som jag aldrig förstod att jag hade) är som bortblåst. just som jag sade det, så får jag en chans till. svart släpper bevakningen av d5 och nu ser jag situationen klarare. sådärja, nu tar jag kommandot igen. +7,35 +14,86 och skall en amatör som jag kunna utnyttja hela situationen fullt ut...? +15,30 och jag behåller trycket mot svarts försvagade kungsdomäner. plötsligt gör jag rätt i flera drag, och det betalar sig. +17,45 här ser man klart att svarts s är pinnad mot k, så jag hade lätt kunnat gå ner med qxa7 och schackat. men det här funkar också, och för ett proffs hade det här varit matt i 10 drag. för mig blir det några fler drag, men jag vittrar ett segrande övertag. av någon anledning ser jag inte att qxa7 är snabbare, och hade jag spelat så här mot ett proffs så hade han undvikit matten helt och hållet. på vår nivå lönar det sig att tvinga motståndaren offra sin d, så jag går ner och hotar att promovera a-bonden. svarts d och s ser farliga ut, så jag måste gå ur gaffeln på e2. +10,65 och ett tryggt övertag för vit. nu är jag bra sugen på att kriga nere vid a8, och jag väntar mig ett gäng utväxlingar. svart slår säkert med t, och då får jag det till priset av en bonde.vill sedan svart fortsätta striden så ryker bägge hans t. ok, då får man vara flexibel och ändra plan. svarts agerande stärker ytterligare mitt övertag, och jag kopplar grepp med en schackning. eftersom min l täcker a8, kan jag frilägga 7:e raden och bygga upp ett mattnät.  bättre hade varit kg6. 7:e raden frilagd och nu väntar jag mig strid vid a8. nähä, då passar det ju bra att 7:e raden är frilagd så lägger vi trycker där istället. sådärja, nu känns matten inte alltför avlägsen. hoppsan, han ger sig inte. möjligen överreagerar jag här och undviker den direkta konfrontationen med rxf2 låt han få tornet, för det deltar ändå inte i mattsättningen uppe på svarts planhalva. här gör jag en felkalkyl snart som svart gudskelov inte heller ser, för han kan promovera bonden till s och ta initiativet. nu kan svart schacka mig med dels sitt t och en blivande s på f1. aha...ibland har man tur. jävlar...om svart promoverar bonden till s så kan han matta mig istället. 40. qxf2 hade varit det korrekta spelet här. vit gav upp. 
-------------------------------------
en skum öppning, som heller inte har någon bra statistik för vit. vit lämnar den seriösa teorin, där 4.d3 är vanligast med 50 % utdelning för vit; om svart spelar 4...c6?.  -0,50 och jag ligger före i utvecklingen. -1,27 med bästa draget 5...dxe4. -0,84 och jag föredrar att avancera bondekedjan. -0,99 med bästa drag 6...be7 ! -0,95 min position är klart bättre än vits och jag har diagonalerna öppna för mina l. -2,72 och svart borde ha öppnat upp damsidan istället. -1,09 här hade jag vunnit mer tempo genom att spela b5, och vits s har ingenstans att ta vägen. -2,63 och det här partit är i mina händer. +2,39 jagar på vits s och öppnar samtidigt en diagonal till för min l. -3,43 och vit greppar efter halmstrån. jag satsar på rätt häst och frigör centern. -3,59 och jag hade vunnit mer om jag slagit nxe5, men mitt övertag tillåter det mesta i det här läget. -2,70 och jag kan inte längre pinna vits dam med min l på g4. -8,25 och det här är rena motorvägen fram snart. -8,51 och vit ger upp.

queen's gambit declined (d30), standardsvaret dessutom. queen's gambit declined (d30), öppnar upp för min l mot c4. fortfarande queen's gambit declined (d30), men det vanligaste draget nc3 är till svarts fördel. det näst vanligaste svaret nf3 är till vits fördel statistiskt. här ser man direkt att svarts l f8 kan bli hotfull, så det är bäst att följa spellinjen för  queen's gambit declined (d30). här går man upp med s till c3. han väljer ett lite mer udda drag i qgd, där 5...bb4 hade varit i linjen. efter lite moget övervägande så valde jag att följa den udda linjen, och säkra b4 mot en ev attack från vits l och s. här avviker svart från queen's gambit declined (d30), där 6...be7 hade varit i den linjen. normal utveckling, och frigörande av rutor för rockad. säkrar g4 innan jag gör rockad. normal utveckling. svart gör sannolikt rockad han med, och sedan börjar mittspelet. lyfter upp positionerna, jagar iväg svarts s på a5 och skapar luft åt min l på c1 för vidare utveckling. frilägger den bakre raden så sakteliga, samt skapar förutsättningar för framtida kombinationer. bakre raden frilagd med endast t'na kvar, samt förstärkning med d mot e4 där ett antal utväxlingar kan ske. låt utväxlingarna börja. detta behövs för att öppna upp det låsta eländet. behåller greppet i mitten, och utväxlar s hellre än l. ska jag utväxla s på f6 eller l på d6 ? löparna är viktigare i slutspelet, så kan jag minska på hans l är det långsiktigt sunt. förvisso har jag en stark diagonal längs b1-h7, och det hade kunnat motivera slagning av s på f6;men det är för tidigt att bygga mattnät. nu slår han säkert cxd6, och då aktiverar jag antingen mitt a-t eller så går jag d5 för att avleda s. nu måste han flytta någon av s, annars förlorar han material. det öppnar för utväxling på e5, eller dubbelpinne av s'a med l. inte mycket att tveka på, utan det är bara att utväxla s. aktiverar a-t och utmanar svarts t på e-filen. offrar han sin d av taktiska skäl, eller är det en blunder ? det verkar vara det senare, så vi slår d direkt. ser en trippelgaffel på c6 för d, så materiellt tänkt går jag d till c6. nu blev det roligare, för material lär utväxslas. men han lär väl parera med l på e6. en dubbelattack mot s med d och l till e4 kan vara effektiv. trängt läge, och jag som trodde att jag skulle få material direkt :-) men så sakteliga vinner jag mer och mer tempo, genom att både attackera och försvara mig samtidigt. han måste ha missat att jag har min l på e5, så jag slår hans t med den. här lämnade svart in. 
-------------------------------------
petrov's defence (c42), för att undvika ruy lopez. petrov (c42), french attack, statistiskt till svarts nackdel. följer grundlinjen i petrov (c42), french attack. till vits fördel med 43% fast med 19% remipotential. standardsvaret i french attack, men fortfarande till vits fördel. här är det nog bäst att backa hem med s, och standardsvaret i petrov (c42), french attack är också mycket lämpligt 5.nf6. här skyddar jag även min d mot en ev framfusig l. nu ser statistiken bättre ut för petrov (c42), french attack, och svart vinner tempo genom att gå med l till e7.  här lämnar vit standardlinjen för petrov (c42), french attack, där 7.bg5 hade varit i den linjen. säkrar g5 mot framtida attacker. normal utveckling och vi har sk "italienska löpare". bra för min d som kan säkra sig i sidled om vit attackerar med s och l mot c7. spelar aktivt och undviker att backa ner med s. här skapas åtminstone lite framtida utväxlingar. snabba utväxlingar, men i längden är det bättre att röja undan hoten. risken finns annars att vit kan mobilisera kombinationer med s, l och d. slår med d för att komma igång med lite kombinationer. vits s kan förvisso hota på b5, men då behåller jag skyddet mot c2 och schackar på e5. ser en kombination som kan ge mig hans l. börjar med att schacka efter hans parering med s går jag med d till f4. parerar han istället med l så förlorar han tempo av att gå jo-jo med l. då går jag med t till e5. då får vi se vad han gör. han sabbar sin rockadmöjlighet, vilket var lite oväntat. då blockar jag b5 i händelse av att han vill tracka min  d med s. bäst att spela defensivt -men aktivt- och säkra l med t på e5. föredrar oftast ett offensivt spel, så jag vinner hellre tempo genom att avancera och utväxla s. en mer positionell spelare hade omgrupperat s genom att backa till d7 och sedan gått vidare till c5. det tar för lång tid, och kräver mer positionell rutin än den jag har. nu har jag en snygg kungsgaffel på d7 mellan k och hans d samt l på b3. sådana tillfällen ska man alltid utnyttja. en livsfarlig gaffel för vit, och det blir nästan tråkigt enkelt att matta honom. slår jag med t mot hans på e1, så är matten definitiv. min d på d6 täcker flyktrutan h2, och det är godnatt för vit. mer utmanande är att vänta med matten och knipa hans d istället, för att samtidigt få lite rutin på dammanövrer. mattläget kvarstår ännu, och slår han min s med g-bonden så slår jag hans t på e1 och mattar. undviker att matta för spänningens skull och schackar med d på g6 istället. sådärja, nu har jag endast materiellt övertag. positionellt står vit i potentiell remikapacitet. det ska bli intressant att öva på dammanövrer nu. vit har två t kvar, och det gör honom hyfsat farlig. dessutom står mitt t så illa till, att en utväxling är klart motiverad. vit har ett t kvar, en s och en l samt sex bönder. farligast är hans l som har direkt diagonal mot min k, så vi utväxlar l på c2. hoppas han inte går till c4.  skönt att han nappade på  den utväxlingen.  backar hem. och laddar om för en ny attack. behåller initiativet genom att schacka, och behåller även tempot. nu hinner jag aktivera mitt t, och samtidigt blockera d-filen. han lämnar skyddet av sin s, så vi går ner med d till c1 och stressar. ok, han försvarar s men hans bonde på a4 står en prise. här gillar jag inte idén av att ge hans s manöverutrymme genom att slå axb5, utan jag bypassar till a5. sedan kan jag blockera hans b-bonde med min dito. han skapar stress genom att avancera sina bönder, men jag har en gaffel med min d på b2. detta låser vit till att försvara damflygeln statiskt, medan han måste agera dynamiskt på kungsflygeln.  nu hinner jag blockera b5 innan han blir farlig som promobonde. gafflar han med s på a4, så slår jag b-bonden med d. han stressar fram fler bönder, och stormar lite på min planhalva. blockerar direkt, så jag slipper tänka på dom. nu blockerar han sin k, och det kan utnyttjas med d. hotar f5 och han kan inte parera med t p g a dubbla bönder. han försvarar f5 med k, men det gör honom bara mer inträngd. försvarar han med s till d1, så schackar jag på h5. det gör jag i vilket fall som helst, för nu är hans k avskuren från att backa hem. då sckackar vi och sedan ryker hans t. nu är vit bekvämt inträngd på h-filen, och han kan endast agera desperat i försvar. min f-bonde står förnämligt placerad, och tillsammans med d så kan vi knocka vits k i nästa drag. den här gången får han ingen frist, utan nu sätter vi in nådastöten där satt den. 
-------------------------------------
king's pawn game (c44) king's pawn game (c50) här lämnar jag king's pawn game (c50). 5...d6 hade varit i den linjen, men till liten vits fördel. nu får han ett stort övertag p g a mitt förhastade utväxlingsdrag. här hade det varit bättre att gardera mot vits s med c6 istället. min kommande öppning för fianchetto är ganska uddlös och ger vit en tempovinst. nu när vit rockar på damsidan, så framstår mitt föregående drag som ännu sämre. en fullständigt verkningslös fianchetto, som istället hämmar min l i dess framtida utveckling. vit vinner ännu mer tempo. här går jag på finten och tar vits bonde på f4, vilket endast ger hans d större manöverutrymme. det hade varit bättre med antingen h5 eller f5 här, så hade jag inte varit lika inlåst på min halva. en förhastad tabbe, som jag beskrev tidigare. förbereder min l för att agera på diagonalen h8-a1.  lika bra att utväxla och reducera pjäser. här borde jag ha tittat noggrannare, för vit gör en dundertabbe och oskadliggör hans d. mitt första motdrag är förvisso bäst, men jag ser inte fortsättningen. här har jag ett starkt övertag, som jag dessvärre inte förvaltar till fullo lite längre fram i partiet. å vilken tabbe vit gör här, men ännu värre är att jag inte tittar noga och ser hur utsatt hans d på f3 är. *pannslag* här är jag blind som en åsna, och missar att ta hans d med tornet på f3. här blir vit ivrig, och hoppas på en snabb promovering vid g8. men då jagar jag honom med kungen, och minskar lite på hans övertag. säg att benfliza går ner med tornet till h8, så undviker jag frestelsen att ta det. istället går jag upp och schackar vid e1, så kniper jag hans promoverande bonde vid g7. äntligen börjar jag tänka lite taktiskt. detta gör att han förlorar sin promobonde snart ;-) sköönt !! försenar hans planer genom att schacka. här borde jag istället tänkt på att mitt torn kan nästla sig in hos vits k genom rd2 och sedan rc2+ när vit räddar sin bonde. nu har vit tempot och initiativet igen p g a min föreg miss. vi kör sålänge remi är tänkbart. jagar hans bönder. hotar tillbaka med min promobonde och slår han på c5, så hinner jag upp till promo. här slår han förmodligen mot c5, men då slår jag a3 och slår han då d3, så tar jag hans t. slår han senare med t så får jag tillgång till d2. går han till a4 så avancerar jag till c4 och skyddar. skönt att han inte slog min c-bonde, för nu blir det jämnare fighting. för tillfället kan vit inte slå någon av mina pjäser utan att förlora material. bra ! är han ivrig så tar min d-bonde, men då ryker hans t. slår han min d-bonde, så hinner jag upp med c-bonden och på slutet ryker hans t om han slår nu. intressant läge, för om han vill hindra mig för att queena på c1 så ryker hans t. nu får han jobba med t om han ska hindra mig från att få övertaget. det ser överlag ut som att åtminstone remi ska uppstå, för hans tidigare överlägsenhet är försvunnen. hans t kommer att ryka. tar han min d så ryker hans t. nu handlar det om att förhindra att han får upp någon promobonde, samt att han inte pattar in sig. är han seg, så blir det här ett långt slutspel. tar kommandot över b-filen med schack. vill han försvara bonden så går han till a5, och då är han låst längs a-filen. vit försöker avleda uppmärksamheten från promobonden. glöm det ! dags att sätta k i arbete. med tungan rätt i mun, så kan remi undvikas. borde nog ha gått till f5 istället, för det här leder till remi. justja, avlägsen opposition hade varit det rätta draget. på f5 så hade våra k stått med tre rutor emellan och är antalet rutor udda, så är det opposition. än aning försenad opposition, som antagligen endast kan åstadkomma remi. fast med tanke på vits stora övertag i mittspelet, så är remi inte så illa pinkat. vi försenar hans promobonde med schack, och det kan även vara en vändpunkt till min fördel. nu måste han sätta sin k i säkerhet, och det sker antagligen på a6. då kan jag skära av hans väg på c7, och promar han då så har jag en skåvare med t på a1. håller hans k avskuren från annat än a-filen. hoppsan, han överraskade mig lite där. men då går jag bara upp ochtar opposition igen. här hade kanske t till b4 varit snabbare, men jag spelar r till a1 och får mer överblick på läget så. nu måste han tvunget gå med k till b8. undviker att han repeterar dragen genom att gå med t till f1. då kan inte parera med s mot någon ruta på rad 8. knaske hade t till e1 varit lugnare, men jag är lite irriterad och går tillbaka till a1. nu vill jag inte repetera några drag, så jag går till a5. där kan vit inte hota mig med s iaf. nu kan vit endast flytta s, annars är han matt med k till c8. ger mig förutsägbarhet, och bättre chanser att planera fortsättningen. hotar f7, vilket kan ge mig hans s om vit går med k till a7. jagar in vits k i hörnet med t till f8. återigen blir vits drag förutsägbara, vilket underlättar. går vit tilbbaka med k till b8, så tar jag opposition med k till b6. går vit med k till a8, så ryker hans s efter t till a7. han bjuder på en matt, så vi tackar och tar emot. klart ! 
-------------------------------------
two knights defence (c55) här funderade jag om jag skulle ta f7 med s eller med l, men beslutade att ta med s. det ger fler möjligheter i fortsättningen.  här lämnar svart two knights defence (c55) f ö . 5...0-0 hade varit i den linjen. här fortsätter jag att jaga svarts löpare. i övrigt så behöver jag komma ut med mina torn och min dam. mina pjäser är en aning blockerade, så det är svårt att bygga upp någon snygg kombination för tillfället. utväxlar l mot s på d4. ett ganska aggressivt inbjudande, som kan leda till att vi snart utväxlar våra d. om inte annat får jag lite spelrum för tornen. bäst att isåfall flytta bt istället för ft, om utväxlingen sker längs f-filen. men vi får se. om svart spelar medvetet, så kommer våra d snart att utväxlas. fördelen är att jag gör det med schack. svart spelar som väntat, så jag går ner och utväxlar d. så får jag ett t på köpet. han går ner med l för att skydda d4, men då dubblar jag på e-filen. nu har jag både materiellt och positionellt övertag. en rad möjligheter att agera med mina t öppnar sig. pressar uppåt och skär av svarts k i sina färdvägar. en naturlig utväxling. nu gäller det bara att behålla pressen uppåt, och leta efter avslut. det börjar bli dags att sätta k in i spelet, men först lägger vi en bondestruktur på ljusa rutor. då kan hans l inte tracka dom. han siktar förmodligen på att ta min c-bonde med l köksvägen. bäst att låta a-bonden stå kvar och parera,men se upp för mörka rutor sålänge hans l existerar. ser inget omedelbart, utan passar på att sätta a-bonden på ljus ruta. stoppar även svarts a-bonde på sin promoväg. nu är det dags att sikta mot k, och ev mattnät kan växa fram. bonden skyddar fint även om han parerar på c7. det är alltid klurigt att finna mattar när det står många pjäser kvar på brädet. får se upp för patt också, samt hans lömska l. måhända offrar han sin l medvetet för att försena mattläget. men jag vill helst slippa hans l. så jag tar den iaf. då knyter vi ihop mattnätet. vart han än går med k, så slår jag g6 med d-t. säg att han går kc8 och sedan kc7, så säkrar jag e-t till h7 och sedan går jag ner och mattar. nu är det endast en fråga om teknik, och sedan är han matt. matt inom ett drag. där satt den ! 
-------------------------------------
choosing the sicilian dragon. a very anti-sicilian move this was a lame move. obviously, my opponent sees the threat on the bishop. a better move would be e6 blocking the f7 square and setting up a possible d5 pawn thrust. also, by moving my knight, i not only lost pressure on d4 but also encouraged white to move to d4 putting pressure on my wayward knight. when i was playing this game i thought this looked okay because it looked similar to the yugoslav attack with the noteworthy exception that my opponent was not playing the sicilian dragon. such naivete. my opponent is starting to take control of the center. finally, the move i should have done 2 turns ago. too late now. this is a weeker move that be7. correct me if i'm wrong chess experts, but i believe h6 weekens the pawn structure should i decide to castle on kingside while the be7 provides the same pin-break without troubling the pawns. case in point, the pin is still there despite h6. this is now the second time i have made a decent move but a turn or two late. you will see how much it will cost me. now this is where things start to turn bad. it is also, where i started focusing all my energies to get out of this jam.  here i thought, ng6 could lead to chasing away the bishop and provide a good defense should the pawns come forward. i believe a better move would have been to move him back to c3. it would have at least opened up space on the kingside. my bid to start to control the center. i feel like this was one of my first decent moves in the game. i made a good step at controlling the center here while the en passant means he gave up a key central square that was really annoying me. the downside was that it weekened my kingside. in retrospect maybe i should have worked on castling. i loved this move attacking 2 pieces at once. i really thought that at this point i had gotten out of a bad jam. i was so ambitious to take the knight and the lead that i didn't take much time to consider that bd7 and queen-side castling might have been the safer option as my opponents king was safe from harm. to stop that bishop from tripleteaming the pawn from the other side of the board. didn't have much of a choice here. i had to keep that pawn alive to blockade the e-file. i assumed he would just trade queens. i suppose i could have checked his king with qg5  and then tried taking the f4 pawn with mine and the queen would provide cover. probably would have been the better move. i've commited myself to that pawn now. i wanted to activate that rook somehow. rh2 would have at least protected the pawn and allowed me to release the bishop. i think i rushed through these moves more than i should have. the goal was to fiachetto the bishop to attack the queen. bad move because it isolated my rook from any action whatsoever. terrible!  ok, so i fianchetto the bishop and then when he blocks with his bishop i don't have the guts to take him. being up by a bishop, i definitely should have taken him at this point. how many blunders have i had in this game so far…don't answer that. i've lost count by this point.  laughable, i just wasted 2 moves, no really, 3 moves. still not out of it yet though. at least in my mind. ng4 would have been much better here. it would have done the double task of attacking the queen and protecting the e4 pawn. this was my last (and fatal) blunder. had i made the ng4 move, i think that i might have been still in the game, although clearly still at a positional disadvantage despite my 2 point lead. so, skeeterss0, if you're reading this, good game. you made less mistakes than me, and fully deserved your win! and that, my friends is how not to play 1.e4 c5 2.bc4...

standard knight  philldors defence. i prefer nc6 because d6 blocks one bishop and makes another one good !? regular development  i marked this ? but later i understood  castling  ! ?? what? why not 10... nxa4 11. bxa4 rxa4 !? complete development  castling  come on. threatening mate  nope  pinned pawn  only move for a draw some conditional moves coming up if black doesn’t want the draw he can do 19... qxf7 20. bxf7 but black is losing badly  ugh ugh king gate. white a ueen is no longer needed for the draw king check and draw is declared

another sparkling little game from steve rush. "my best ever win in terms of graded opponents and my best game ever and my best move ever." black copies white's first move. one pawn offered - the centre game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/center_game taken, it usually is. another pawn offered, turning it into a danish gambit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_gambit black takes again. white offers another pawn. black takes again. white takes back. the most common continuation is for black to give both pawns back with d5 6. bxd5 nf6 7. bxf7+ kxf7 8. qxd8 bb4+ 9. qd2 bxd2+ 10. nxd2 and a fairly equal ending, maybe white has a very slight edge. however black seems to try to hold onto the extra two pawns - with fatal results! white also won quickly in the game https://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x1303449&mv=10&rnd=0.4251310708559717 voigt, martin (2258) vs. parindra, amran mojo pahit (2032)		2004.05.30 which continued 6.	nc3	qe7 7.	nge2	nf6 8.	o-o	o-o 9.	e5	bxc3 10.	bxc3	ne8 11.	nf4	qc5 12.	qd3	nc6 13.	rfe1	nb4 14.	qe4	a5 15.	nh5	d5 16.	exd6 e.p.	nxd6 17.	qe7	qxh5 18.	re5	nc6 19.	rg5	nxe7 20.	rxg7+	kh8 21.	rxf7+	kg8 22.	rg7+	kh8 23.	rg8# steve plays an interesting move. of course, two pawns down it would be silly to encourage exchanges. i find this move very strange though. i see on the gameknot opening databases that this position before bf8 has been met several times, and no less than 12 moves have been tried by black - some very unsuccessfully it must be said. nf6, f6 and kf8 are the mot common tries. bf8 is the 5th most popular 9at the time of writing this of course!) surprisingly this natural developing move doesn't seem to have been played by anyone else - nf3, bxf7+. qb3 and e5 have been tried. natural development. and also by white.  black pins the knight steve gives himself a couple of exclamation marks for this move, but in fact he is missing better alternatives. 9. bxf7+ kxf7 10. ne5+ is playable - winning back the piece as the knight can't be taken without black losing his queen. also in this position is a variation of the légal trap - 9. ne5!! and if 9....bxd1 10. bxf7+ ke7 11. nd5 mate. if 9....be6 10. bxe6 fxe6 11. qh5+ g6 (forced 11...ke7 12. qf7#) 12. nxg6 and white is on top. or 9...dxne5 10. bxf7+ ke7 11. ba3+ and black is busted. 9. qb3 attacking both b7 and f7 looks good too, and indeed 9. qd5 with the same double attack. steve comments "if takes qxf3 leads to a massive potentially over whelming attack....well this is what sort of happened anyway!" in fact fritz first of all gives bxf3 as the best move and later moves to liking be6, before switching back to bxf3 - and in both cases gives advantage to black. however this sort of position is much easier to play as white - white has all his minor pieces developed and attacking prospects, while black has to find careful defensive moves. well done steve, out of the various options, he chooses the best! compared with the position on move 9, as well as attacking f7(although of course this pawn is protected, but it means he doesn't have to worry about say 10...bxf3, which is now met by a mate on f7) and b7 he is also attacking bh5. when looking at this position, fritz at first gives black a slight advantage, but after looking deeper into it fritz gives white a slight advantage of plus 0.09, then later plus 0.25 "all forced now" is steve's comment. protecting the bh5 and attacking the queen. one pawn back! obviously the best move. played so that the queen on d8 protects the rook on a8. steve again plays the most accurate move, not allowing his opponent time to consolidate. it also meet his opponent's threat of 12.....rb8 followed by rxb2 steve says "what else?....my opponent said after the game he expected my queen to move at some point and then bb2 was en prise to gain counter-play....sadly for him not to be!" fritz gives 12.....rc8 as the best move for black with plus 2.22 for white. the obvious continuation. fritz now suggests black should give up the queen with 13...qxc7 with +5.94 to white. however giving up the queen is really equivalent to resigning. so black plays the only other legal move. steve "my best move ever." and "a whole queen sacrificed". of course if the queen is taken white has a choice of queen mates with nf5 or nc6 mate. "only move to avoid a double knight mate". in fact fritz is still wanting 14....qxc7 but that is hopeless for black (+11.75 to white). i guess in the eyes of fritz anything is better than an immediate mate. ok dear reader, stop and find the quickest mate. fritz likes this move too. https://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=214011 forced. forced again. "although bxnc6 is mate i decided on a prettier mate." so he played this. forced. now find the quickest mate for white. another check. nc7 anywhere is a quicker mate. another forced move. again find the quickest mate. check again. forced. i must admit this is a pretty knight mate, and i don't blame steve for playing this rather than the quicker mates. 
-------------------------------------
once more into the fray the so-called modern defence, actually at least 60 years old. white takes the centre. black completes the fianchetto white rules out transposing into the king's indian defence black does the usual 3rd move, going into the pirc–robatsch defence i have a plan of attack against the fiachetto position the usual move for black. i want to play bc1-e3, but i don't want it hit by ng4, so i play... this move also rules out nf6xe4 followed by d5 regaining the piece the usual 5th move. although we had arrived 15 minutes late, i was moving almost instantly, while he was taking a long time over his moves. i think he was afraid of an attack against his king. i continue with my plan he prepares to strike in the centre. i develop he hits in the centre i leave the way opne for castling on either side. he takes i take he takes again of course, not 10. qxd4? ng4! with advantage to black. he continues with his policy of exchanging. this time i don't go along with it. as played in mandak, miroslav (2089) vs. doucha, ludvig (2107)  2002.11.09, which continued 12. o-o d5 13. exd5 nxd5 14. bxg7 kxg7 and agreed draw on move 47. i play something else.
-------------------------------------
?! most modern books on the benoni do not even cover this move and for good reason. it is way to slow! the appeal of this move is that white essentially shuts the door on tactics for the time being. holding true the stientz altruism, "it is better to keep your enemy at arms length until you have finished developing." well he did not say that exactly.  another rare move. sometimes this knight will end up on c4 via g3-f1-d2-c4. quite a tour if you ask me. the other option(which you will see in this game) is the knight supporting the rare f4-f5 break. opp! did i just give up too much.  alternative variation: [mostly played is ] 8. bg5 o-o 9. qd2 bd7 [⩱]  a very good idea! black who has all the time in the world can flick in ...b7-b5 whenever he feels like it.  alternative variation: 9... nh5 [!?] 10. nxh5 gxh5 11. bd3 nd7 [ has turned out well for black in practice]  preventing b7-b5 for the time being.   a standard move aimed at harassing the knight on g3.  alternative variation: 10... nbd7 [!?] 11. be2 [ and now black has a choice of no less than 5 moves. 11...h5; re8; ne8 and rb8. all of which are relatively unexplored. ]  developing and making way for a possible nf1-ne3-nc4  ? here black should be thinking to playing for f7-f5. in that case the rook sits better on the f-file. later in the game this move will come back to bite black in the butt.  alternative variation: 11... nh7 [!?] 12. be3 nd7 13. o-o h4 14. nh1 f5 [⩱]  creating an annoyance for black but this should be very easy for black to handle. this move along with it's bf4 cousin are easy victims for the benoni player.   ?! and this is not it.  alternative variation: 13... qb6 14. qd2 nh7 [⩱][ has scored very well for black in 2500+ play] alternative variation: 13... nf8 14. qd2 n8h7 15. bh6 bh8 [⩲]   i want to play f4  there are 4 games in my database from this position and white has won them all.  ? black should never give up his dsb so easily.  alternative variation: 15... bh8 [has not been explored. ] alternative variation: 15... bd4+ 16. be3 bg7 17. a5 b5 18. axb6 qxb6 19. rfb1 f5 [⩲]  ?? it was this move that sparked me to start a defending 101 thread in our club forms. all to often mistakes come in pairs. i am sure black thought white can not play f4 but he was wrong. at first i was quite disappointed with black's choice. however, the more i thought about it i was being too harsh on black as the correct 16....qd8!? is not easy to spot.  alternative variation: 16... qd8 17. f4 qf6 18. e5 qg7 [⩲]  ! all of the sudden the white dragon has awoken from his slumber!  ! now the small positional error of 11...re8 comes back to haunt him. truth be told black has been conditioned to expect white's attack to come through e4-e5. however, the king's knight is on g3 not f3!   and now the error 16...ne5? comes to bare fruit. the bishop is pinned. when playing the benoni such deep tactical combinations must be thought out. the idea of 16...qd8 is to swing the queen over to g7 where it can be exchanged for the white one with little disruption to the king pawns.   everything exists for the powerful attack. #1 piece majority #2 space advantage #3 open lines.  it is mate in six  ? alternative variation: 27. kh1 rg8 28. rg1 rxg1+ 29. rxg1 qg7 30. qxg7#

sicilian  development  !? cool  check ?! die b for n trade fiercequeen, up by 1 fancietto  bishop out, ready for castling  castling  development  guarding  kingside  not changing much well rook  i would’ve went bxc4 threatening rxe2, but this is ok !? ? better was nxd4! check! rook still guarded by knight  queen trade pin cool move i would have went 24... bxf3 !? threatening ne7+ pretty equal rook check trying to trade oof ?! ooh  boring boring boring boring boring boring still boring ugh. why not rxg5? finally! some action! ooh dead checkmate!

annotiamoci.....  fin qui son pronto a tutto.... mi sembra proprio una bella grunfeld, si fa interessante, non l'amo tanto e sinceramente col bianco mi rompe un pò.  le mosse precedenti le ho giocate in automatico, cf3 l'ho scelta in alternativa a ac4 che giocavo regolarmente fino a 2 anni fa e mi creava grossi problemi dopo cc6 e poi a5; l'ho abolita dopo aver preso una scoperta stupida con dc7 e c5xd4 che mi costò un pezzo! molto regolare.... qd2 forever qui! qui l'alternativa era tb1 con l'idea tb5, continuando a non fidarmi e non gradire la grunfeld preferisco il gioco conservativo. tc1. ...aspettando cc6 secondo me con questa spinta viene a cadere tutto il gioco della grunfeld. non dico che sto in vantaggio, ma mi riprendo un pò d'iniziativa. questa l'aspettavo, qui l'inchiodatura non mi preoccupa, devo liberare la donna, percio: o-o l'idea è di creare un bel pedone passato e sostenuto prima delle possibili semplificazioni. con questa mossa si da il via alle danze! non potendo difendere cavallo e pedone b7 ho calcolato: 16...; ce5 17. cxe5;axe2 18. cxf7; axd1 19. cxd8;txd8 20 txd1; axc3(o dxc3) 21 dxb7
-------------------------------------
 secondo me con posizione complicata ma bianco in vantaggio netto! qui come da copione! svista clamorosa! come approfittarne? intanto ch6  porta in salvo l'equino poi c'è pensare a mangiare un alfiere. e andiamo  3 netti!  3!!!con svariate possibilità d'attacco...'n capita mica sempre! debole e disperata! attacco diretto!re7 unica! ( rg7,df7 ,rh8,axd4 ,cxd4,df6#)
-------------------------------------
  qui la vedo scura per il nero, forse la migliore è dxd5 in ogni modo da parte mia non vedo grosse chance! immagino un tentativo di difesa! questo è un colpo di fulmine...stavo pensando agli scacchi oppure a mangiarmi la torre netta, poi ho guardato distrattamente il subdolo equide, nascosto e quasi dimenticato e.....slam! 3 secondi netti per innamorarmi!

de por qué nunca hay que rendirse.  queda planteada la apertura italiana contra la defensa siciliana.  impide el salto del caballo y el enroque. bloqueo en flanco de rey, ataque en el flanco de dama.  demoledor. intento amenazar a la dama blanca para conseguir un respiro.  pero obtengo justo lo contrario. empatados en cuanto a piezas capturadas pero mejor posición blanca.  al ataque. a la larga ese alfil va a resultar muy pasivo. tomar en d4 es una mala jugada. por esto era una mala jugada. ahora la dama hará caja. dolor. y el caballo en e4 amenazado. hay que moverlo y desproteger al rey blanco.  me sorprende que no tome el caballo. prefiere tomar con su dama. el enroque lo pierde de todas formas.  pensaba que no cambiaría las damas pero confía en su ventaja material.  debo aprovechar su falta de desarrollo y la exposición del monarca blanco.  abriendo diagonal blanca.  le da una salida al rey. empieza el baile. atrapado. no va a poder escapar. ya no hay jaques. si no puedo dar mate en e5 lo haré en otra casilla. b8 por ejemplo. casillas negras cubiertas pero ¿y las blancas? :)

just won 9 in a row.  i’ve been pretty “streaky” lately.  opponent from portugal.  his games don't include many normal sicilians.  game note: “5...e6 my 7 vs his 4 in centre.  i’m pretty happy with my development.”  game note: “6.bb5 seems typical but his b will need to retreat right back to whence it came.  i think d4 would have been good.”  game note: “8.ba4? nope.  needed to exchange to maintain initiative or retreat to keep the lsb.”  game note: “check out 10.d4 also.”  12.e5 pretty annoying too.  avoids …bxa3.  game note: “13...be7 not a critical move but how to decide over ...be6.  the latter controls a central square but reduces it's scope.  the text move maintains or "improves" scope and allows for ...o-o.  i’m +2 material.  i control 5 in the centre vs his 6.”  is it worth the isolated pawn to maintain initiative and eliminate another one of his pawns controlling a central square?  i thought so.  or develop his dsb to connect his rooks.  leaves my isolani a bit weak but creates an immediate threat on his k-side.  i really like his move 17.qg3 game note: “18.rxe4?! really!!  here come the fireworks.”  checking now afterward and i think it’s unsound.  but as the game plays out he’s able to use it to his advantage.  game note: “20.nc4 sets up a q/r fork on b6.  can i still get in ...bf5.”  in hindsight, how did i not realize there was no time for …bf5.  i missed 20…nd4 …ne2+ solving all my problems.  if 21.cxd4 then i have the discovered capture 21…qxc4 and his pawn to boot.  i don’t get it.  did he not see nb6 or nd6.  and my k is safe.  …be5 also looks decisive.  game note: “22...qe6 and ...rd8 would also be nice.”  planning to advance his c-pawn maybe??  game note: “24...rd2 is a powerful post but dangerous on account of discovered attack from his dsb.”  game note: “26.ng4 and there is the discovered attack. nice move! (worried).  guess i should have recaptured with the ugly 25…gxf6.”  amazingly i’m still +2 material.  28.qc7 is very immediate.  game note: “28...qb2 check that one out.”  yes in hindsight …h5 or …f5 to push the n and threaten his q.  game note: “29...qxa3 gives me some relief on the q-side.  also hoping to get in ...h5 of ...f5 for k escape.”  game note: “30.qc7! wide open game.  i need initiative again. (worried)”  game note: “31.f4 is this a trick?  sure opens up the f-file for him.  i still have ...qc8+ in my back pocket if rxf3”.  playing through afterward i can’t see any trick or benefit.  buys me time.  …ne6 also good.  playing around too much with my q.  somehow i thought this was a simple choice but i was wrong.  game note: “36.ne5 at first this move scared me but i'm starting to look at some good possibilities involving ...qf4 pinning the n; ...ne6 attacking the q and discovered attack on his r; ...f6 pushing the n and discovered attack on his r.  so maybe i actually have an advantage here (plus material so yes i do).  36...qf6 maintains the possibility of the others.  good tactics but at some point i still need to mind the structural imbalance on the q-side.”  the culprit move?  game note: “38.rh8+!  wow!!  38...kxh8 forced.”  game note: “39.ng6+ a brutal fork.  what the heck happened?  i thought f7 was overprotected, but i might as well resign.”  in hindsight, i guess the innocent looking 36…qf4+ …f6 were faulty.  but it looked so good at the time.  let’s insert 27…ne6 and force him to move his q first maybe…?  at least that also reveals a discovered attack on his r.  i resigned 1-0 well played “alvexisback”   
-------------------------------------
petrov's defence is sometimes considered somewhat dull; indeed it's strong drawing weapon in - for example - kramik's hands.  for lower-rated players, to whom draws are rarer it should offer chances for both sides though. as should any other opening. 3.nxe5 d6 is considered mainline - maybe it is the pawn formation that arises after ...nxe4 (equal number of pawns for each wing) that has given the drawish reputation for the opening. 3...nxe4 is another option this is an interesting move but unfortunately bad, too. black gets some pawn for the piece, but the compensation is inaquate as black will find it hard to complete his queenside developement. 4...ne4 is the normal move, when white can play 5.qxd4 or 5.bb5!? black could have castled and started normal developement with ...nc6 and ...d6. objectively this is equally good, but then again, then black would simply play piece down. at least this brings some chaos on the board. i think this is the strongest. white is ready to haras the queen with rb1, controls e4 and gives queen bishop the possibility to take residence at the long diagonal. the most active square for the knight i thought this move for a long time, and my thoughts went something like this: as the e5 pawn is likely to be removed and black is ready to castle, i didn't want to give black any free tempi by playing rf8-e8 with a check. i considered 9.bc4 with the threat of ng4 but i wanted to answer ...qc5 with ne4, but the bishop on c4 would then be en prisé.  black had many options here and as this move lands black in trouble, maybe should've played e6 or nc6. i was  very fond of the idea of activating pieces by harassing the queen rather than play safe with 0-0, when black could get his queenside developed. it is true that black will pick a pawn or two, but i had no intention of going into an endgame where queenside pawns mattered. after analysing some variations i deceided that white can build such an activity, that it just must be enough. threatens mate and attacks e5-pawn twice.... a lot more active than 11.0-0 and probably better  it's pf course temting to pick another pawn, but maybe black should start rounding the e-pawn with 11...qe7.  the bishop is still aiming for the long diagonal, but this allows b2 rook to lift smoothly. the a-pawn is off little importance, as white will be able to swift his forces towards the black king.   black's only active piece gets now kicked away. this move contains a pawn sacrife as black has a little tactical resource here 13...nh6 14.bxh6 would be extremely unpleasant. this piece of tactic regains the piece but loses some time. ! this and the next move makes nf6  sacrifice a terrible threat. 15...c4 fails: 16.ng5! with the point that 16...cxb4 17.nf6  wins the queen. and now black will pay the price of moving his queen eight times of total 16 moves. it really does not matter where the queen moves. this loses queen for knight and a rook, but white is threatening mate so...  16...qe6 is slightly better but black still loses her majestety: 17.nf6  gxf6 18.rg4  qxg4 (18...kh8 19.qd4! h5 20.qxf6  qxf6 21.bxf6  kh7 22.bd3  kh6 23.bg7#	is the point) and now black has an extra tempo compared to the game continuation. ! kh8 can be ansvered with nxh7 the bishop at this square is a monster and completely decides the game. it should be mentioned, that the simple 19.rxg5 fxg5 can be followed with 20.qd4! f6 21.bc4  kh8? 22.qxf6  rxf6 23.bxf6#. instead allowing the queen sac black should play 21...kg7. i didn't bother calculating all those murky lines, as the black king has more moves. besides, i had already found a winning method simple enough. now black will find it impossible to parry the threat of 21.rxh7.  it's quite the same what black moves here. now white mates shortly 22...kg8 23.qh3 and mate next move.  this mate is prettier though! 
-------------------------------------
  i tried to not to check, when he changed him pawn to queen.. may i win a queen? yes i can.. watch now i must be careful... he made a mistake, he would not give me chance... he is trying to move to him pawns... but he can't ½ -  ½ he offered draw... 
-------------------------------------
opponent from belgium 1.d4 nf6 - nid?  checking his past games and as white he likes kia.  as black he likes french and indian.  gotta challenge him again after this.  my theme in this game... central control. game note: 6...g6 gives me time.  also want to consider lining my own dsb to take out his on h6. game note: 7.nf3 centre = 7 vs 4 but his fianchetto is potentially strong.  my qc2 could be well positioned. game note: 8.bf4 interesting (provokes tactics), counter-intuitive (to k-side development), gains another centre control. 8…a6 …nh5 starts showing up in the computer analysis.  very tricky because there’s the discovered fiancheto behind that.  he finally plays it at move 12. game note: 9.a4 put an end to those tactics. game note: 10.bd3 controls a centre square but blocks my q from 2 centre squares. 13…f5 in hindsight.  checked with computer and it prefers the text by a tiny amount.  either way i’m compelled to play 14.h3 to mobilize my lsb and trade off my weak n for his bad lsb. game note: 16.bxh5 even though i didn’t foresee this or want this, i did it in the spirit of controlling the centre.  if i retreat my lsb then it has no control on the centre.  if i let his h5 n back to f6 then it controls 2 centre squares.  follow up with 17.f4 (even though, in hindsight, the computer prefers something like qe2… but not by much) and maybe a r to the middle to continue with the central theme and a break with the e-pawn.  in hindsight i won based on his k-side being opened up by this doubled pawn. 18…rc8 in hindsight the computer considers this a small error.  i don’t think i doubted it at the time but i was also watching …bxc3. 20.fxe5 the computer likes f5 on account of moving the n and then d6 (+2.20 vs text +0.50). 22.d6? why not 22.bxc5 but i guess i get it anyway on move 24. game note: 26.bd4 because now my q and k are lined up in a skewer.  plus his dsb has great central and long range control. game note: 26...rg5 if he's thinking 27...qxh3 then qxf7 wins.  i replied 28.ne4 because that was my focus but maybe computer line of qf6+ kh6 then 29.ne4.  kinda the same thing i think except kg8 sets up the fork. game note: 29...kg8 sets up a n fork on f6 game note: and he fell for it but it's pretty much lost anyway. 1-0

saída clássica sampeta ! resposta clássica do adversário ! dama exposta premeditadamente para tentar capturar peão do meio (e torre) e preparação para trazer bispo para o jogo ! defesa clássica do adversário. bispo apontando para possibilitar o xeque pastor ! defesa clássica do xeque pastor ameaçando a dama recuo da dama ainda ameaçando o xeque pastor. não entendi o que o adversário fez mas.... aproveitei...!!! hehehee

je ne suis pas sûre que ce coup soit un bon choix pour les noirs. je ne suis pas à l'aise avec ce type de position. j'ai voulu simplifier la situation au centre. c'est une mauvaise position pour les noirs. ce coup est une erreur.  la position noire n'est plus tenable. ?? c'est fini. 
-------------------------------------
the king's gambit, currently my usual opening as white. the cunningham defence. this happens to be also my favourite defence against the king's gambit, so we were reading from the same script. the immediate d4 is perhaps more popular. the most common move, though gallagher regards qxd6 as more accurate. the exchange of queens is said to give white a good endgame, despite his pawn down. i was expecting bf5 here; i can't remember what i had prepared against it, but had given it a lot of thought. however, black opts not to pursue the attack on c2. the move he plays is a bit risky given the open centre. the black knights will now be driven back with loss of time. the retreat to f6 is impossible because of nxg5. driving the knight right back to the back rank. black's position is looking very passive, though cracking it open does not prove to be an easy task. white completes his development. keeping an eye on e3 without getting in the way of the rook. an eventual redeployment to b2 is also contemplated. while sacrificial ideas such as g3 came into consideration at this point, i decided to continue to develop my positional advantage. defending the knight from the discovered attack and positioning the queen on the long diagonal. passive, but not so easy to dislodge. pinning the bishop with the threat of re8 . forcing an isolated pawn. not bxd6? otherwise re8 . the knight will re-emerge at the right moment. the dark-squared bishop can redeploy along the a3-c1 diagonal, now that the black knight has gone from f5.. heading for the weak light squares on the king's side. the bishop is forced into defensive duty again. coaxing the black knight away from e5, as 36. ...qxh6 37.nxh6 followed by 38.nf5 would be awkward for black. keeping the black bishop tied down to a passive position. this manouevre was all to defend the e8 rook, thus unpinning the bishop. white feints to attack down the h-file. in fact he has conceived the surprising plan of swapping off all his active pieces and strong d-pawn for black's passive pieces and weak d-pawn. reason: the resulting pawn ending should be won for white. the preliminaries include improving the position of the white king, while black´s cramped position forces him to sit and watch. i think this was to free the king from the defence of the f-pawn, anticipating a white king march. a final precaution against the black rook invading down the e-file. and now here we go. black was probably not expecting this, but i had recognized that it was necessary to stop the black rook getting to e3. black now has an unpleasant choice; an equal pawn ending which will be decided by white's c-pawn, or a rook ending where white's strong extra d-pawn will probably prove decisive. mobilizing the queen's side majority. letting white's king in among the king's side pawns. and immediately 1-0.  there is no chance of a stalemate. 
-------------------------------------
caro-kann defence. this game is the first time - and surprisingly the only time to date - i have encountered it in actual play. the advance variation. the beginning of an aggressive continuation, the bayonette attack. the best deployment for the knight in this variation. black adopts a quiet formation originating with karpov, avoiding the wild tactics that can otherwise occur. in the last few moves white has gained some space, weakened some light squares on black's king's side, and removed the light-squared bishop which was protecting them. now white regroups in the centre, awaiting black's french-style counter-attack. a pawn weakness for white, which black will try to exploit. preventing bb4 , which would disrupt white's support for his weak pawn. black's bishop, though technically "good", no longer has many options. white's king's side formation may look unusual, but the plan is to exert pressure on black's pawn centre. (this eventually happens, though not until the endgame.) to allow the development of the other bishop, though this move allows black to create a few problems. still protecting the two pawns, but now also pressuring the weakened light squares f5 and g6. extra protection for d4, though this does not last long. allowing black a knight outpost on f4. this was a conscious decision, banking on being able to generate more important play on the other side of the board. preserving the bishop and shackling the black knight. now it is once again white's turn to go on the attack. not the most comfortable castled position, but at least the rooks are nearly connected. this gives white a tactical target. threatening forks on both e6 and g6 after a pawn exchange. a sidestep to prevent black's rook escaping from the coming fork with rxf1 . this will lead to an exchange of dark squared bishops, which should not ultimately be to black's advantage. better would have been to admit rcf8 was a mistake and move it away again. now white wins the exchange. seizing the f-file for the rooks, as black can keep the c-file blocked. those weak light squares again... black attempts to find counterplay. not kc7?, otherwise rf7 ! putting the question to the intruding knight. black obviously judges that this knight is stronger than the bishop - which might appear logical, but that is not how things will work out. the big question for me at this point was to stop black큦 queen coming down the c-file and possibly getting a perpetual (or worse). i thought this plan was the best way of tying her down. qc6 would have allowed the pleasing tactic 37 qd6  qxd6, 38 ed! the bishop joins the action at last. once again shackling the knight. black's remaing trump is of course this pawn. white insists on going for the g7 pawn, attacking b7 and securing a winning breakthrough for an eventual pawn ending. black needs to prevent rxb7 . disconnecting black큦 passed pawns. it might look as if the white rook is cut off from the a-pawn, but in fact it will reach it in time. getting out of the rook큦 way, while also threatening to enter the a-pawn큦 square. a last attempt to make trouble with the knight from d5. getting the king off the a7-g1 diagonal in the event of a pawn race after g5. hoping for 48 rxa2? nb4! (in fact this would probably still have lost - the knight is too far away from the king´s side pawns.) 1-0. black resigns because of the breakthrough 49 g5!, where neither king nor knight can catch the h-pawn.  
-------------------------------------
an opening experiment; i usually play the sicilian. in this game i prepare to defend against the ruy lopez. the archangelsk variation. black neither takes the pawn nor commits his bishop to e7. the möller defence. the dark bishop is developed to an active square, but there are two drawbacks, both of which are illustrated in this game. the bishop serves as a target as white pushes into the centre, and black ends up with a backward c-pawn. bg5 is also possible. now that black has castled, the bishop switches to the new diagonal. black plays to pre-empt d5 followed by an exchange of dark squared bishops which would double his pawns (though he might have the better bishop as compensation). the knight aims to regroup via d7. aiming for g3, a regrouping allowed by the relief of pressure on e4. the subsequent threat of nf5 was a theme of much of the middle game. trying to solve the problem of the backward pawn on c7. however this only creates more pawn weaknesses, at d7 and shortly also on the a-file. ultimately these will decide the game. this looks precarious, and was probably bad. i had calculated the immediate results, but the a-file pawns eventually proved an important weakness. fixing the weakness at d6. the intention of this was to draw the rook off the back rank, giving my own rooks first bite at the c-file, but this was not effective. if 27 rc7,  then ...rc8 and white has nothing better than the exchange of rooks. black's position is not comfortable here. white's knights will prove stronger than his bishop and knight, and besides d6 the advanced a-pawn is an additional weakness. preventing white pressurizing d6 from f5. the knight is accordingly redeployed. intending to pressurize a3, but black should be defending. black has been completely outmanoeuvred. 
-------------------------------------
this was a mistake... he's in some trouble here. useless move... more free pieces for me. also a mistake... merely a stall, given the circumstances. he probably should have stepped his queen up. it would have saved him a lot of grief. not a terrible move, but not a great one, either. more free pieces. and the pain continues. if that were a knight instead of a bishop, this would have gone a lot slower, given 12.qh8 ...kd7 13.nf6 ...kc8, at least giving him temporary respite, surrounded by his pieces. but given the eight point advantage, this game is already decided. didn't really think this one through. useless check. didn't really think this one through either. yet another useless check. bad trade on his part. here i'm starting the pawn pressure. standard procedure would have been; i'm ahead, even trades equals good. however, the pivotal part my queen was playing said that wasn't really an even trade. not the best of moves. yes it gets a piece out, but it further weakens the queen and allows extra time for my queen to move to a better position, qf4, meaning he loses at least one piece. violá, i get a piece. still wary of the f7 pawn... a little too late, might i add. still more pieces for me. he should have started to run, and fast. here's where he really messed up. rather than seeing the mate and beginning his run, he stepped into the pawn and cast his death in stone. might as well have pressed conceed....

ese caballo fue decisivo para que blancas dicidiera en proteger a la reina o hacerme jaque. aquí blancas debió proteger a sus reina, en lugar del caballo
-------------------------------------
se haplanteado la variante berlinesa de la apertura española.
-------------------------------------
 la teoria nos explica que una posibilidad es con 4. o-o nxe4; 5. d4 nd6; 6. bxc6 dxc6; 7. dxe5 nf5; 8. qxd8 kxd8 con mayor flexibilidad en las piezas blancas. seguido de 9. nc3 y las blancas tienen mejor estructura de peones y el rey enemigo en el centro y sin posibilidad de enroque a cambio de la pareja de alfiles del negro. la jugada de la partida responde a jugar una partida más posicional, pero mi rival comenzo muy temprano con un fuerte ataque en el centro. está jugada es un prematuro ataque en el centro, además de conceder el peón de "e4" quedará pronto en inferioridad.  no 7. e5, porque ahora todos los cambios me son favorables y cambiar damas me parecia un buen cambio a mi favor. no me molestaba hechar a perder mi estrcutura de peones en el flanco de dama debido a que también tengo la opción de bxc6 dejando la misma estructura a mi rival más un final de alfil contra caballo y con peón demás. las torres tarde o temprano se cambiarán en la columna "d". aca podría haber evitado el cambio en c3 pero preferí terminar con mi desarrollo, todos los cambios son favorables, mi estructura de peones en el flanco rey es bastante mejor y tengo la posibilidad de crear, alli un peón libre. mi fuerte alfil ubicado en e3 controla importantes diagonales como las de c1-h6 impidiendo la penetración de la torre negra hasta "d2", ahora mi rey iniciará su camino hacia el centro con el fin de poder crear un peón libre en el flanco rey y tratar de cambiar las torres, de esa manera además mi rey podrá atacar la debil estructura del flanco de dama del negro. una jugada dudosa en vez de 17...h4 mejor era 17ne8 con idea de nd3 y nc4 donde el caballo quedaría bastante bien.    ahora las casillas negras son debiles en casi todo el tablero. esto es una ventaja para mi alfil ya que tendrá bastantes casillas para ocupar y atacar. está jugada me pareció mala, debido que tratar de ganar la calidad en g3 es imposible mi torre ahora ira a d1 para el cambio de las torres lo que sin lugar a dudas me favorece un segundo peón de ventaja ya es suficiente para asegurar una victoriaahora el caballo tiene pocas casillas y donde salte llegará a una casilla negra que será inmediatamente atacado por mi alfil, de ir a f6 sin ninguna duda se jugará bxf6, con amplia ventaja blanca.  lamentablemente el rey negro no tiene ninguna opción que nos ea pasar por casillas negras. 26...nf4?? era única 26...nf6 seguido de 27.bxf6 ganando el final, la jugada de mi rival es inferior ya que ahora perderá su última pieza, su caballo. sin prisa. en su didáctico libro "técnica para el jugador de torneo" de mark dvoretsky en el capítulo 10. "como realizar una ventaja" el destacado entrenador nos explica que: la idea principal que tiene que seguir el ajedrecista a la hora de realizar la ventaja, no consiste en ganar lo más rápido posible, ni mucho menos". en otra parte del texto explica: "al realizar la ventaja en el final, hay que imitar a la serpiente boa, que termina con su presa muy poco a poco". en esta partida, a pesar de que el final es ampliamente favorable al blanco y estar el caballo negro absolutamente perdido preferí jugar 28. h4 para evitar una pequeña cadena con g5 y f6, además de jugar ahora el negro 28...f6 entonces 29. ke3 g4; 30 h5!! dejando al peón h sin obstaculo rumbo a la coronación.  ya no hay nada más, el triunfo blanco es solamente cosa de tiempo. acá las negras abandonaron. quiza no haya sido una gran partida pero creo que podemos aprender algunos conceptos de ella. es importante entender que de todos nuestros partidos podremos sacar concluciones. 
-------------------------------------
 espero les guste esta partida y le deseo a mi rival taper71 un gran éxito en sus otros encuentros, esperando tengamos alguna vez la chance de una revancha.

mistake. blunder: -13.04 » 54. ka7 ke3 55. b6 f2 56. b7 f1=q 57. b8=q qa1+ 58. kb7 qb1+ 59. kc8 qxb8+ 60. kxb8 g4 61. kc7 g3 62. kd6 g2 63. ke5 g1=q 64. kf5 best: -2.93 » 54. kc6 ke3 55. b6 f2 56. b7

-------------------------------------
un ejemplo que confirma que la defensa siciliana suele crear posiciones de doble filo. esta partida es interesante por la sucesión de ataques y de fallos y por cómo, al final, se imponen las negras que toman las decisiones adecuadas en las postrimerías del encuentro. hasta aquí pura teoría. planteo la variante najdorf al ser la que he elegido para aprender a jugar la defensa siciliana. nunca me habían jugado c4. veo que habilita la casilla a4 y el jaque que puede ser molesto. me cubro. ataco el caballo que está en una posición muy buena. hay que echar al alfil , empezar a ocupar el centro y dar salida a mis piezas. batiendo la gran diagonal. el enroque corto ahora es menos atractivo. no puedo seguir atacando el centro. al flanco de rey. me lo esperaba. sigo ganando espacio a falta de un plan mejor. ahora sí hay que atacar en el flanco de dama. columnas centrales abiertas. peligroso para mí. mi otro alfil en la gran diagonal negra apuntando al peón en b2. pero... una baja sensible, un error que me sale caro. dos peones menos. dama amenazada si se mueve el caballo. he de aprovechar las columnas abiertas y atacar si no quiero morir lenta y agónicamente. a ver si comete algún error... hay partida todavía. el caballo de momento no se va a mover. no me interesa cambiar. presión. creo que me viene muy bien despejar la octava fila para que mi torre entre en juego cuando sea necesario. deja de defender el caballo. va a atacar el alfil. lo sé. pero he visto algo interesante. esta jugada concretamente. salgo ganando en el intercambio de golpes pero tengo todavía dos peones menos. ataca el punto débil f7.  mate en una. buena defensa y ataque. ¡ ay ! tres peones menos y un alfil pichándome en el culo. vuelve a tener mala pinta para mí. igual que antes o ataco o muero. manos a la obra. doble ataque. yo voy con mis peones. no puedo perder ni uno más. y él lo sabe. doy dos golpes y recibo uno. algo he mejorado. y presiento que voy a ganar. sus peones en a2 y b3 no se pueden mover de momento. debo sacarlo de ahí. ataque. su monarca está ahora fuera de juego. a atacar. el único peón al que puedo amenazar. casillas blancas a ser atacadas por el rey.  mi ataque con el rey compensará esta pérdida tan dolorosa y sus peones blancos siguen lejos de sus respectivas casillas de coronación.  mi peón ahora es oro. míos esos peones. se acabó la partida. ese peón no se toca. blancas abandonan. ha sido una partida muy bonita. 
-------------------------------------
e4, una invitación a plantear la defensa siciliana ya que desde hace un tiempo tengo interés en aprenderla. así que... don miguel, a quien profeso una cierta veneración, siempre presente en mis pensamientos. me inclino entonces por la variante najdorf. hay que evitar que domine el centro. molesto. muy molesto. lo quiero muerto. desarrollo en el flanco de dama completado. ninguna agresión sin respuesta. lo sabía. no suele importarme perder el enroque si veo que tengo opciones de evitar o aplazar dicho movimiento y así aprovechar ese tiempo para desarrollar piezas. tenía que empezar a atacar para no ser completamente dominado. ataque a d6.  me escondo un poco. peligrosísimo el caballo. a por él. ¿cambias? no. por fin lo capturo. pensaba que iba a tomar con el peón de e4. lo penalizo inmediatamente. ha visto la diagonal que va desde h3 hasta c8. me voy a una posición que me permita defender y atacar al mismo tiempo. una torre por la otra. de momento me sirve de parapeto. yo también he visto la diagonal. renuncio a mi caballo en b4. me puede dar mate. por eso no ha capturado mi alfil negro. hay que huir. despejando el centro. defensa y ataque con la torre. opta por salvar el alfil y atacar mi dama. ¿ me la cambias ? ¡ que no ! pues protego a la mía y me acerco al rey blanco. ahora que no está ese peón tengo una posibilidad de dar mate con la ayuda de mi caballo que ya no queda obligado a proteger a la dama. custodio la casilla que necesita mi caballo. error. mate inevitable. abandona. 
-------------------------------------
gambito de rey. no sé jugarlo y no lo he entrenado. esta apertura tiende a producir partidas rápidas y alocadas. divertidas, según algunos. normalmente desarrollo alguna pieza pero ahora decido tomar en f4. ataque al punto débil f7, mucho más débil en esta apertura. hay que movilizar piezas. centro blanco muy fuerte, otra carácterística del gambito de rey. enroque largo blanco preparado. esperaba que tomara con la dama para presionar el punto b7 pero toma con el peón y abre la columna del teórico enroque corto negro.  protejo mi enroque por si fuera necesario, aunque espero no hacerlo en corto. lo esperado. también esperado. salida para la dama, debilidad en h2. por fin un ataque serio. ve la manera de librarse de mi ataque sacrificando el alfil... y mi enroque. metiendo presión. otro sacrificio que abre la columna h. ¿ no habría sido mejor capturar en a8 y empujar los peones centrales? creo que llevar al rey a c4 es una locura. todo parece perdido, sin peones y con el rey muy expuesto. tengo que recuperar peones ante la pasividad de la dama blanca. no recuerdo una partida en que hayan capturado todos mis peones. pero hay que seguir jugando y esperar el error. bloqueo y acercamiento a la zona caliente del tablero. ese peón no debe ir a a5. desclavo el alfil y me escondo un poco. ¡¡¡ ahí está el error !!! ha habido suerte. lo normal es mo equivocarse.

black: “this was a mistake.  i routinely play the nimzo-indian defense against 3.nc6 and the queen’s indian defense against 3.nf3.  having just made moves as white in several other games (where the c-file is on my left) and with other games waiting for my move i played in haste without even looking at the board, believing my opponent had developed his other knight.” 9.be3 now seems like a natural continuation after which black intended to take over the queen side with 9.… a5, but white does not cooperate, making a case for playing that move now instead of the text. black realizes that any chance either side has for a full point lies on the king side, but he plays it safe instead of taking the initiative there with 15.… exf4 16.rxf4 nh5 17.rf3 bh4. in such a closed position knights are more mobile than bishops, hence white should actually have wanted black to play 18.… nxd3.  moreover, the previous note suggests taking the initiative on the king side, with 18.g4 for example. [?] the losing move for it creates a hole on f5 that white can exploit with his knights.  having committed to playing defense it would have been better to accept the embarrassment of 19.… bd7, which he has to do next move anyway.  nb.  gameknot does not have a function for adding move evaluation marks to a game score, hence i have adopted a standard of enclosing them in brackets in the note proper. [!] the natural push-by, 28.… g4?, loses the exchange to 29.bh6+. [!] 29.… fxg5 would also have failed against this move, just not as badly as it turns out. correctly rejecting 33.exf5 qxg5 34.f6+ bxf6. [?!] given his pawn plus perhaps white should have taken a more conservative approach and brought his king into play on e1 or e2.  it is difficult to argue with results, however, given black’s rejection of 40.… exd4 41.e5+ kd7 (and not 41.… ke7 42.exf6+). inferior alternatives are     • 41.kf3 qg3+ 42.ke2 qxe3+ 43.kxe3 exd4+ 44.kxd4 re7 45.rxh5 rxe4+ 46.kc3 bf6+     • 41.g3 bxg3+ 42.ke2 qg4+ 43.nf3 nxe4     • 41.ke2 exd4 42.e5+ ke7 43.d6+ cxd6 44.exd6+ kxd6 45.rd5+ kc7 black can level the position with 41.… nxe4 42.qxe4 exd4 43.qf4+ kd7 44.d6 bg3 45.qxd4 bxd6.  the text also works until … [?] … black fails to recognize the power of his passed pawn with 43.… d3.  now ♪ it won’t be long before it’s crying time. ♪ [!]  
-------------------------------------
8.… qxe2+ 9.kxe2 na6 10.d3 looks to favor white slightly. white’s prospects for victory currently lie on the queen side where he has the pawn majority.  he does realize this eventually, but 14.c4 would have started the ball rolling sooner. white would have been better advised to delay this push until after getting his king into position to support it, for example with 22.kf1 kf8 23.ke2 ke8 24.a4 nf6 25.kd3 kd7 26.b3. now 24.b4 looks to be better than the move white actually makes.  “fortune favors the bold.” [?]  (gameknot's annotation function does not allow for move evaluation symbols in the score proper.  this is my workaround.) [?] anticipating that black was simply going to move his king back and forth between e6 and e7 white offered a draw at this point.  when black declined he realized he had made a mistake on his previous move, and black had let him get away with it by not playing 40.… ke5. black must keep white’s pawns within sight of his king: 42.… kxf5 43.bd2 kg4 44.bg5 bf2 45.ke4 bxh4 46.bxh4 kxh4 47.kf3 g5 48.c5 g4+ 49.kg2 for example. 43.… bf2 would have been ineffective: 44.be3 bxh4 45.bxb6 ke5 46.bc7+. 48.… kxh4? lets white promote a full move before black can. a rather unusual king vs. king and pawn stalemate position: the side with the material advantage is the one with no legal move. 
-------------------------------------
siciliana. todo normal. el maestro najdorf siempre presente. impetuoso. me gusta. tendré que empezar a desarrollar. y a disputar el centro. demasiado peligroso el caballo. sin dudar. ataque en flanco de dama. contraataque en flanco de rey. conecta torres. quiero abrir las columnas. ahora el enroque parece un error. habrá que darle la vuelta a ese error. y para ello debo sacrificar la torre, al menos el pierde un alfil. defiendo el importante peón y ubico el caballo en otra posición más activa. sólo puedo defenderme de ese ataque con el monarca. bloqueo y ataco, un movimiento bueno. la diagonal blanca es inatacable, hay que atacar donde se puede. error. adiós torre. además ganando un movimiento con el subsiguiente jaque. se acaba la partida sumando la pieza que me queda al ataque.  
-------------------------------------
if this were the slav black could allow the lsb exchange of the for the knight where it is to exert more control of the e4 square. a retreat to temp the knight to take the bishop and open the h file for black's rook, with the obvious negative being the doubled pawns and lake of pawn mobility. a strong move by white, white has better control of the center and also has better development so he is seizing on this initiative and playing energetically. not forced but black would have had a very cramped position had he instead chosen to play be7 instead of the capture as white could then push on to e5 with an unclear position developing where white would still stand better. white exerts steady pressure in the center and on black's knight black could have captured with the pawn and then fianchettoed his bishop to exert pressure on the long diagonal, it would have also given his pawn mass more mobility, but instead chose to recapture with the knight. there are ±'s to each plan. though blacks knight stands better on f6 and now black's bishop still has some dynamism, i would probably play this either way in the future.  a temporary location for the queen to engage white's queenside pawns and deter white from long castling. though the deterrent is probably only psychological as white would still have a good game had he chosen to 0-0-0 here. white also has the option to let the pawn go to energize his rooks and black would be ill advised to take the b2 with white now capturing the b7 pawn and the ensuing pig on the 7th would be unenviable for black to say the least. white controls a lot of space on the queenside but play will soon be on the kingside and white's backward pawn at c3 is a long term weakness, though it will not factor into this game. white has the bishop pair, control of the center and queenside, the game is far form preordained but objectively white looks to stand better at this point. eying the h pawn prompting a trade and the removal of white's strong bishop pair and looking for relative equality setting a trap a solid developing move, though it neglects the implicit threat ahead. white should resist taking the pawn and evaluate the threat at hand, black's queen is eying the h3 square and from there all roads lead to rome. white needs to think of damage control here. a serious mistake that leads to the end of the game though not with a bang but with a wimper. a loss of material cannot be avoided form this point on and a drawn game is out of reach for white form here on without help form black. a bishop sacrifice to avoid mate qxb would have been a slight mistake, but would probably have led to a comparable position after white plays 20 h4, g5. also, black should have considered nf4 and the complications that ensue, but this move was not considered during the game. trading down to a won endgame, though this is probably an imprecision. this move means the end for white, from here white is forced to trade queens. the white queen has no escape and must be traded leaving black too far ahead for any real counter play. this prevents white from breaking the connectivity of blacks pawns & white resigns. 
-------------------------------------
miniatura italiana. hasta aquí nada nuevo. ataque inmediato al enroque negro. el ataque que las negras planeaban contra caballo en f3 ya no parece tan útil. sigo adelante con mi plan el alfil cae sin posibilidad de recapturar al atacante. ataque mortal denla dama.  
-------------------------------------
apertura inglesa. tomando el control del centro con e4.  desarrollando piezas. nc3. empiezo las hostilidades con e5.  estructura de peones en flanco de rey debilitada fxg6. ataque al punto débil qc2. buena posición para el caballo nc5. piezas negras en el flanco de rey inmovilizadas desde hace varios turnos. hay que abrir hueco por el flanco de dama. a4. ahí está mi hueco :) rxa1. ahora es su alfil blanco el que queda inmovilizado. casi no ha podido desarrollar sus piezas en toda la partida. a pesar de haber perdido dos peones y de su bloqueo no se rinde. hay que perseverar. sólo puede atacar con peones. obstá ulo eliminado. a coronar. me conviene el cambio. descubre a su rey y no va a poder parar mis peones. qxf5. decide no prolongar la agonía. no ha contrarrestado bien mi apertura y eso ha pesado como una losa. tampoco ha desarrollado sus piezas a tiempo. se ha enrocado muy tarde. ha hecho todo lo que no se debe hacer en una partida. 
-------------------------------------
lately i’ve been playing nothing but the english opening.  i’ve found that not only does it offer white good long-term chances in a drawn-out positional battle, but occasionally it offers relatively quick tactical victories if the opponent obliges. opting for a catalan style of game (but without black’s d5) rather than a more reserved and less ambitious “traditional” english approach with d3.  i like the space advantage and slightly more tactical opportunities presented. developing, and also trying to keep the tension in the center.  it’s something i’ve been trying harder to do lately, rather than immediately committing in the center and resolving the tension before advantageous or the opponent's plans emerge. since i was allowed to play e4, grabbing even more space and taking even more control of d5, i thought now was the time to do so. still keeping the tension in the center and also preparing to fianchetto the other bishop. maybe this was greedy and perhaps even loosening my queenside, but i wanted to prevent b5 and some queenside counterplay of my opponent.  i really wasn’t sure about this move, but i didn’t think it was horrible. at this point i thought it was time to begin some sort of “attack”, or at least clarify the center.  i reasoned that if ...cxd, then i would have a very nice center with lots of space there (after exd).  and, if ...c5, i would still have a nice central space advantage with a locked center, allowing me play on the kingside if i wanted it.  i had second thoughts about the placement of my dark-squared bishop and didn't want to commit it yet.  it seemed okay where it was for the moment, exerting some influence on the kingside even though still undeveloped. preparing f4 or nf5, both of which seemed good to me. with the black rook moving to the e-file, i thought the possible opening of the e-file with f4 was no longer quite as attractive, so i went ahead with nf5, which seemed like a great square for the knight, with multiple possibilities that would create kingside weaknesses to dislodge. opposing the black rook and preparing for a possible rook lift and swing to the kingside. preparing for a kingside attack.  i was even considering the possibility of g4 at some point.  i strongly considered the obvious bg5 but thought it would simply invite h6, putting the question to my bishop and “forcing” the bishop into taking the knight, only to be replaced with another knight (an excellent defender of the kingside).  since i was really hoping to dislodge any and all kingside knights, i held off, and decided to begin with the queen and perhaps prepare g4-g5. although this looks very logical, i think this was a mistake.  i was really hoping for this actually, and was surprised my opponent played it.  perhaps he just didn’t think there was a lot of danger to his kingside, which does appear well-protected with the knight and bishop, but it turns out that he really isn’t as well-defended as might appear and could have used this knight in the defense. now with the knight on d7 no longer supporting it's counterpart, this seemed like a very useful, strong attacking move finally. frankly, i was really shocked by this.  i thought that my opponent would have surely seen the dangers of bxf6 and might just simply retreat the knight right back to d7 again.  i can’t remember which gm said it, or exactly what he said, but something like “don’t go looking for baubles on the side of the road when there are more important things going on.”   the obvious and most forcing move.  he is now faced with several choices, none of which are all that pleasant. i think this was probably the least attractive alternative.  i think maybe gxf6 or even bc8—to get rid of the knight and at least initiate a double attack—were likely better. i first considered nh6+, but didn’t see it giving enough and eventually found and preferred nxg7.  even though it is less forcing, it causes more damage.  obviously, the bishop can't take the knight because after qg4 it is mate next move. 1-0.  black resigns, as there really is nowhere to hide.  a bad mistake on my part would have been the obvious 20. nxe8 or 20. bxd8.  instead, the attack on the exposed king had to be continued, and bringing the knight back to f5 was the way to do it.  now, if the black bishop doesn’t take the white knight on f5, it’s mate soon after 21. qg4+.  and, if 20….bxnf5, then after 21. qxbf5, followed by 22. be4, it’s either mate on h7 or black has to give up his queen (after 20…qc4 and 21…qxe4).   
-------------------------------------
from this position black could secure a slight advantage with 8...nxe4 9.o-o d5 (as in petrov-pucher, le touquet, 2006), which is why white would have been better advised to play 8.d3. [?!] the quieter 9.… bd6 10.d4 nxe4 is preferable, but the text definitely gets white's attention, just not enough of it. [?] oblivious to his danger white neglects to address black’s threat of getting his queen into play with check.  11.kf1 seems best; granted it locks in his h-rook, but up a bishop and ahead in development white can surely find the extra tempi to get that rook out of hock. [?] black gave white a reprieve – 11.… d5 12.bf1     • (12.bd3 qg5+ 13.ke2 qxg2+ 14.ke1 qf2#)     • (12.be2 qg5+ 13.kd3 nf2+ wins the queen)     • (12.qf3 ng5 wins the bishop) 12.… qg5+ 13.ke2 e5 14.h3 ng3+ wins the exchange – but white panics and so does not see that substituting 12.be2 for 12.bxb5? and proceeding as in the actual game salvages a draw as in the note following black's 17th move. black passes on the chance for a draw by repetition with 17.… qe4+ 18.kf2 qg2+ 19.ke3 (19.ke1? qxh1+ 20.bf1 qxh2 gives black a rook and two pawns for a bishop and a knight) qe4+ etc. mate in 2: 36.ke4 rxd4+ 37.ke5 rg5# 
-------------------------------------
the most classical line in the giocco piano i usually play 5. d5 which leads to a more opened situation. joining rooks and queen and developping.  pawn storm is launched. i wanted to try a pawn storm and, as the move is in the world db and lead to a black win, i supposed it was ok, don't knowing precisely why. leaving the db the gk computer says it's an inaccuracy. there was no hurry to set the king out of the fireline of the lsb. 13. nxg3 would have been better. preparing a trading sequence on f5 i should have plaid this move earlier (see comment on move 13) protecting the g pawn and trying to open the h file the gk computer prefers d5 logical trade now black has an isolated pawn and white has double isolated pawns both kings are weak, the material is equal, the center and open files are contested, black controls the long white diagonal. the situation seems even. white has little other choice to prevent both 20. nxg3 and 20. nxe3, 2 forks attack. joining the rooks and queen attacking black's isolated pawn and joining the rooks protecting the isolated pawn and joining the rooks taking control of d5. black's plan is to play a further h4 and if gxh4qxe4 + mate. but it's not possible now due to : 22... h4 23. rxf5 rxf5 24. qxg4+ 24. bf2 would have been better but black sticks to his plan (advancing h4) blocking the a7g1 diagonal now, i estimate that the time comes white has little other choice forced move to prevent 28. qxe5+ and protect g4. gk computer preconises exd4 but i was to afraid of qxe5+. in such an edged to edged situation and wide open game with many pièces still on board, it's a risky business to be set in chess. menacing to promote the c pawn... but the computer estimâtes that 28. b6 would have been better. if 29. cxb7 or 29. c7, 29. ... dxc3+ with mate to follow... ... but white sees the danger. ... so that black  takes. if 30. qxc6 qxd4+ with mate to follow by 31. rh8 the d pawn, blocking the dark diagonal is important to prepare the endgame, having the pawns on the bishop's colours trade menacing g4 which black cannot protect so that black menaces g3 protecting g3 and unpinning the d pawn. increasing the pressure on g3 no choice menacing to take the lsb and setting the king on a black square now the draw is sure.  
-------------------------------------
3. con d4 en lugar de d3 se iniciaría el extremadamente complicado e inestable ataque de max lange. aquí sigo otra línea de ataque...  5. ... 0-0. las negras enrocan pero las blancas prefieren ganar un tiempo en desarrollo de ataque dado que el centro está cerrado y el rey, de momento, bien resguardado. 6. ojo a este movimiento que es la clave de la victoria de las blancas: el caballo en f6 queda clavado por el alfil. ¿por qué descuidaron las negras esta situación?. supongo que el razonamiento de levoxine100 sería proteger el caballo con la dama para evitar abrir peligrosamente la linea g al tomar el alfil con el peón g7. 9. --- negras podrían haber jugado c x c..., pero, en principio, el criterio que siguieron las negras es más ortodoxo ya que tomando el caballo blanco suponía perder el alfil b7, y dado que auuuu llevaba ventaja material se debería evitar el intercambio de piezas (quedando así a iniciativa de las blancas). hasta aquí resulta imprevisible el mortífero ataque de blancas. 10. b3 en lugar de b4!... no me puedo explicar este lapsus (tal vez el único, pero suficiente para que la partida de blancas pueda considerarse perfecta). la intención era clara: el ataque doble a caballo y alfil, con pérdida inevitable de una de las dos piezas. yo creía haber jugado b4 en lugar de b3, esto no se olvida fácilmente ya que es una de las jugadas más excitantes, pero al revisar la partida me encuentro con ese bug... lo que demuestra que la mente no está continuamente al 100%, sino que se producen oscilaciones el la curva de la atención, y cuando te pilla en un valle pues metes la pata. 12. ... al fin y al cabo el bug de b3 no tuvo consecuencias: lo curioso es que las negras reaccionaron como si las blancas hubiesen jugado b4, tomando el alfil negro en f2. tal vez la explicación esté en un análisis más profundo por parte de las negras, al probar suerte esperando que el rey blanco tomase el alfil, lo que parece razonable ya que el caballo en g4 estaba muy bien posicionado. en este caso auuu fue prudente e inició un rápido "analize board", descubriendo así que con el rey en f2 las negras podrían jugar c x e4+, a lo que blancas deberian jugar d3 x e4, es decir, negras cambian el caballo clavado desde el principio por un peón... pero la dama negra tomaría el alfil en g5. de esta forma las negras acabarían con la iniciativa de las blancas, y adquirirían incluso ventaja material de un peón.  -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-  12 ... after the bug b3 did not succeed: the funny thing is that the black reacted as if white had played b4, taking the black bishop on f2. perhaps the explanation is in a deeper analysis of the black, to try his hand waiting for the white king take the bishop, which seems reasonable since the horse was well positioned g4. in this case auuu was prudent and began a quick "analyze board", discovering that with the king at f2 black could play c x e4 +, what white should play d3 x e4, ie black exchanges the horse nailed from the principle for a pawn ... but the black lady would take the bishop on g5. this would end the black white initiative, and even acquire material advantage of a pawn. 14. aquí se inicia la secuencia más engañosa, ya que las blancas tenían dos piezas amenazadas...  moraleja: analizar siempre, hasta lo más evidente.  
-------------------------------------
any comments are welcome, especially from all the higher rated players!  this is my game against a much higher rated opponent, so i decided to try the annotation feature and to learn more from my loss. :) black starts with caro–kann defense, which at my level is a very rare choice. i was considering also c4 instead of d4, but then i would end up with an isolated d pawn, which could be a problem. main line. maybe not the best choice to block the bishop, but keeps my c pawn free to move and hopefully knight will not stay there for long i don't know why, but black takes, so i am happy to advance my knight. black also decided to temporarily block his bishop. somehow this move is considered to be ok, although for me the black's position looks very passive. white is ready to move both bishops, but black cannot move any of his bishops. simple development move. black offers to exchange knights,  i have to protect my knight, because i don't want to take on nxf6 giving up my only developed knight and helping black to get the other knight from d7 to f6. moving queen also prepares connecting rooks and possible castling long.  now i checked some chessok database and it says that 6. nxf6 has been played a lot, even by some super gms rated 2740, but my 6. qe2 only by a few, the highest being 2177, so not even master level :( black takes knight and gets another knight developed with a tempo. ok, maybe it was not a good idea to move the q, because now it will be chased away. i guess the only reasonable place for q is d3. . black prepares for fianchetto, attacking d4 pawn, i will make b2-c3-d4 pawn chain to counter that black bishop. developing knight, preparing to castle fianchettoing bishop development almost finished now castling short i decided to castle long just to create more dynamic and exciting game. black's fianchettoed bishop is pointing at this direction, but i was planning to move q to d2/e3 and then bh6. my plan didn't work out :) attacking with a tempo only square developing with a tempo. probably better was qe2 or qe3, but i was still hoping for a possible bh6. now it's getting dangerous for my lsb, there are obviously moves a3 or c3, i considered only c3,  but maybe a3 would be better for long term pawn structure, what do you think? a3 instead of c3?  . i think the only move. . . . i retook with q, but now i think maybe knight 17. nxg5 would be more active? . . in this position black king is fairly safe, but white king not so much, so white is happy to exchange queens. . who do you think is better now after all the exchanges?  i think we are fairly equal.  blacks king is safer, but now after the queens are gone there are no threats to white king either. black has a bishop, which can give some advantage against a knight in endgame, but with so many pawns maybe it will not be the case. at least at the moment my pawn chain is pointing against the fianchetto, so it looks goods for me.  what do you think? just starting to push my pawns, maybe create some threats to black king. i didn't expect this move. what should white do now? i chose b4:  to isolate a3 pawn and  to protect my c3, d4 pawns, which limit black's bishop . . . i want to move my knight to b1, but decided to first overprotect c3 pawn, in view of bh6, rac7, rfd8. so now black has (almost) all the pawns on white squares, so the bishop can move freely. . . . . . my knight is keeping opponent's two rooks busy and inactive, i thought this was a nice achievement :) maybe f3 was a mistake.  g3 just to limit the bishop's movement would be better? . . . . ra4 - what was the point of this move?? moving into dead end, just loosing time? . so now i have created 2 isolated pawns and one is fixed on black square h4, where it can be attacked by bishop, but on the other hand my rook has the only open file. yes, the rd3 was a waste of time. . . f4 pawn sacrifice could also work out. . . at this point i thought i was doing well, but maybe this was a big mistake? i thought i was going to exchange h4 to f7 pawn to have more space for my rooks, maybe even create some vague mating threats (if black moves f7 pawn then r1g6#: of course that's too obvious, but at least it limits some of the black's options). . . . i decided to exchange rooks, so i get the a3 pawn and threaten b5, but maybe i should not have exchanged rooks, what do you think? . so we have exchanged a3 and h4 pawns. i guess the last few moves were the decisive mistake creating passed pawn h5, which i didn't manage to stop. here white could try nxb5: knight for a pawn, but two connected passed pawns would be something, what do you think? . . . at this point i understood that h4 pawn is a real problem, for which i don't have a solution. . . . . . . . . . . . . i was hoping that if black takes, then after exchange i would eliminate the most dangerous h pawn, but black was very careful. . . . . . . . . . b6 was brave, i saw the winning exchange of rooks, but actually that was a mistake, black can just 51. ... rxa4! and white pawn stays on b file, where b8 is covered by bishop. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . losing another pawn, time to resign, all hope is lost :)  i think i played a pretty decent game, holding on for some 60 moves against a player who is rated 468 points higher, or maybe he just didn't press for a quick win, what do you think?

9. ng3? débil jugada. lo mejor era 9. bd3 para luego enrocar y poner al rey en seguridad 10. o-o. esta jugada profiláctica es una pérdida de tiempo; siempre es mejor desarrollar las piezas, ponerlas en acción lo más rápido posible, y enrocar para la seguridad del rey. lo mejor era 10. bd3, que una vez más fue pasada por alto. 12. be2... 13.o-o no es tanto un error pero sí una inexactitud. mejor 15. ne4 que sería una jugada de contrajuego y evitaría peones doblados, que es debilidad de estructura en la fase final. mejor era tomar con el peón f y ganar un tiempo para la salida de la torre. mala jugada. 17. c5. 19. b5+?? 19. rfd1 es más razonable: pone presión sobre el peón negro, aunque la iniciativa la tienen la negras con un fuerte rey centralizado. jugada muy pasiva. 22. b6?? a partir de aquí la partida se pierde para las blancas. no hay oportunidad de hacer tablas. nada que hacer...

this time i will annotate a lost game of mine! will try to analyze what it was that gone wrong! i heard that bobby fischer once published a book about 50 games that he had lost. the name of the book was, if i remember it right: " 50 bad games".  sicilian opening. theory so far. i nowadays avoid this type of move! makes a nasty hole in my pawn structure on e6. but this game i played two years ago and then i obviously believed it was a decent move.  f3 looks a little bit unsound for me? better was maybe be2 or bd3? 0-0-0! now f3 looks like a perfectly fine move, preparing a pawn push against black`s king! the natural follow-up move after f3. starting a pawn push against black´s king side. the logical continuation. a pawn push against blacks king side.  a free pawn or maybe some kind of clever trap? instead of taking back the pawn immediately, white threatens checkmate on h7. black must defend against this threat in the next move! getting the pawn back with tempo and also ruins blacks king camp. i tried to escape with my king. now is white one pawn up and have also destroyed the defense around black´s king! ties up blacks pieces in the defense of the d6-pawn. black´s position have become a little bit cramped. not good of me. the light-squared bishop has more utlity in the defense of my king. makes my white squares weak, because black has still his light-square bishop left. some exchanges have occured! white is clearly better positionally! threatens checkmate at f7. black resigned, can´t defend properly against this threat. if black tries ...qe7, then rc8+ must lead to ...qd8 (only move) and then it´s still checkmate on f7 with the white queen! analyze!!!  
-------------------------------------
very tied game with uncommon situation and draw obtained by sacrifying a rook. looking for a benoni common answer main modern benoni line the benoni move. white doesn't play 4. dxc5 ... so that i opt to take trading developping another possibility was 6. nxc6 bxc6, creating a semi open file in b for the black rook. pinning the knight. another option was to fiancheto the bishop by playing 6.g6 white weakens both sides in case of a castling but white has now a strong center king in safe preparing the castle i do not want to let white fully control the center it seems a mistake, for it enables black to set a pawn on c6, thus reinforcing the central d pawn and it creates a semi open file on b. pushing on the center but the pawn will be hard to defend. defending the e pawn. to prepare a queenside attack the queen can be dangerous, aiming on h7 and she protects c3 c5 would have been better, enabling d4 king in safe but the opened a7 g1 diagonal is dangerous. ... and black has to seize the occasion. only move. black gets a pawn. white prefers to protect his bishop but i think trading (15. bxc4 qxc4) would have been better. black's plan is now to get the b pawn on c3 so that white has 2 isolated pawns. attackin the unprotected f4 knight and preparing to trade. only move if white doesn't want to lose the e pawn. black trades white has now 2 isolated pawns and one pawn less. this is a bad place for the queen but the aim is to send it on a5. developping and stenghtening the center. i didn't found anything better and black has got enough material and positional advance to afford trading. to prepare 20. ... rb8 i choose not to take and to prepare my attack (plan : occupy the open file - done, double the rooks and set one on the first line), estimating that it will take at least 4 moves to white to build a dangerous attacking possibility against the black king and i'll get a mating menace in 3 moves if white doesn't defend. i underestimated the danger of white's progression. i didn't see any other place for the rook but it's a weak move, letting the initiative to white. 22. rb7 would have been better. white is on attack on the kingside to double the rooks black lost one move by playing 22. rc8 i saw little point in this move. the following trade doesn't seem to have much importance in this position. it weakens both kings. in fact i underestimated white's attack. to enable a furher rh4 it seemed to me the obvious move to play white culd have interpose a piece but chooses to move the king. harassing the white king but dame guenièvre is blocked far away from her king and husband. forced move to chase the queen from the c1 h6 diagonal the white queen is less dangerous on this diagonal. but the 2 pieces on line 1 are cramped to prepare 30. ... qh1 31. bh2 rxf4 ... but whites sees the danger and prevents it no choice danger on g6 : if 32. rxg6 ! fxg6 33. qxg6+ kf8 34. qg7+ with mate to follow. preventing the danger equalising material. both kings are unsafe and material is equal but black has 2 pieces blocked in the corner. to counterattack. menacing 34. rh8 mate only move. forced move now white's attack is getting even more dangerous. to protect the c pawn. menacing 37. qe7+ kc8 (forced) 38. rxf8 mate i couldn't find any other idea. white is one rook ahead and the game seems to be lost for black "my kingdom for a horse" the brave perceval goes for a desperate ride to save the situation and obtain a draw. only move to prevent the mate (if 38. ... ke8 39. qe7+mate) white carries on pressing the black king. forced move. menacing 41. rxf7 ... 42. qc7+ with mate to follow or 41. rg7 ... 42. rg8+ with mate to follow. verrry dangerous but in both cases white needs 2 moves before setting arthur in chess. ... so that black has 2 moves available. dame guenièvre saves her husband for she menaces : 41. ... nf4+ if 42. kh4 qxh7+, 43. ... nxe2 it's white's turn to be in trouble. if 42. kg3 nxe2+ 43. ... qxh7 and white is in late in material. black cannot be in advance of material if playing 41. ... nf4 ... but still plays it. perceval lays down his life for his king without any hesitation. 42. bxf4 was another candidate move. reducing the late in material and preparing a draw. 43. ... qxh2 was another possibility but i wasn't so sure it lead to a draw for white would regain the initiative. forcing the draw. if 45. kf2 rb2+ and the white king is doomed. white proposes the draw... gladly accepted !

idea albului e sa il descurajeze pe adversar sa joace d5.  ... fara succes, din cate se poate vedea.  negrul sta foarte bine. are pion in plus, a facut rocada in siguranta, si are in vizor pionul din d4 negrul pune toate piesele pe campurile bune. singura sansa a albului ar fi sa complice lucrurile, in speranta ca, intr-un fel sau altul, va reusi sa schimbe pionii de pe flancul damei, pentru a intra in final cu 3 contra patru toti grupati pe flancul regelui.  diagonala mare de campuri albe si controlul campului d5 fac jocul negrului foarte placut. albul nu are decat niste sperante vagi la un atac pe flancul regelui. albul incearca sa arate ca nebunii sai pot produce amenintari pe ambele flancuri. aducerea turnului in a3 face parte din aceeasi strategie. incearca sa tina sub control campul d5. in caz de schimb pe c4, albul crede ca s-ar putea apropia de obiectivul sau de a schimab toti pionii de pe flancul damei. albul face tot ce poate pentru a da perspective turnului din b3 pe flancul regelui. prima figura de pe linia a treia a plecat. dar mai sunt inca 2! in plus, deoarece pionul din c5 nu poate fi luat imediat (din cauza 20...dc5 21. cf5 dc7 22. nb6) albul pretinde, cu optimism, ca s-ar putea sa aduca calul in d6.  albul deplaseaza a doua piesa de pe linia a treia din calea turnului din b3, si incepe o lunga combinatie cu sacrificiul pionului din c5, pe care o crede ca asigurandu-i in cel mai rau caz sanse rezonabile de egalare. dc5 nu merge nici acum a treia piesa pleaca cu tempo de pe linia a treia, sacrificandu-se ca sa deschida pozitia regelui.  poanta albului. nebunul nu poate fi capturat, din cauza 25.dh5, cu amenintari de mat imparabile. prezenta nebunului in f6 impiedica, in acelasi timp, apararile prin g6 sau f5. dupa ce a stat prost de la mutarea a doua, albul incepe sa creada ca va castiga, fiindca oponentul nu a vazut aceasta mutare, care, isi zice albul, ţl+ar fi facut mandru si pe tal". ... dar o vazuse! sau, daca n-o vazuse, a gasit totusi solutia. regele alb sta prost pe g2, direct intr-o furculita de pe f4, care anuleaza amenintarile de mat pe h7 si h8 atacul albului s-a incheiat. negrul are doi pioni in plus, o pozitie superioara, si va castiga cu usurinta  
-------------------------------------
so here's another game of mine where i manage to win the game. white starts with e4. i decided to go with the sicilian this move was surprising cause i didn't really know hot to react to this. it does stop my king side knight development. well it works like this also, but i weakened my king side a bit. here i have a nice central grip and also managed to kick the bishop w tempo. now my king side is really weak, but in exchange i got his dsb, but i'm starting think about castling queen side. this move just loses a pawn. i didn't know what white was trying at this point. now i see his point. attacking the queen and the knight. a nice move from white. i was threatening qxc3+ so knight retreats. this was a mistake because after 13.c4 my bishop gained scope and can now fork king and rook. a free rook. another pawn won. no problem, ill take it. decided to add support to c4, because its a passed pawn, and might be useful later on. now i just want to connect my rooks and there's really no major threat if kings on g2. doubling rooks to add pressure on the king after f pawn has been removed. had to take a little control of the g-file, because it could be dangerous´s with that rook on g1. i'm attacking the unprotected knight so something has to be done. free pawn again, and with check now. rg3?? this is blunder, because i cant see any threats after takes. by taking the queen i win the bishop. this pawn is now getting dangerous. here black manages to win a pawn but is doesn't really matter. and here white resigned cause he cant stop the queening of the pawn. hope you enjoyed:) 
-------------------------------------
no está claro que capturar de dama sea lo mejor. lo hice para maximizar el espacio. este jaque no se entiende tal vez en lugar del enroque largo correspondía una jugada de desarrollo más simple. ahora ya se nota que la dama está mal colocada, especialmente en caso de ad2 o ad3. en cualquier caso, 0-0-0 no es buena. mala jugada. esperaba d5 peón de más. tal vez ce8 mala jugada. pierde calidad. (!) pierde pieza. era ch5 ventaja decisiva. 
-------------------------------------
défense du pion f7 laborieuse et pas très belle. 3 ... fc5 est plus classique et plus dynamique ... oui elle permet d'éviter le cg5 qui fait si peur tout en continuant de développer ses pièces de manière harmonieuse !  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  f7 pawn defense laborious and not very nice. 3 ... bc5 is more conventional and dynamic ... yes it avoids ng5 so afraid that while continuing to develop his pieces harmoniously ! deuxième cavalier sur le bord ! deuxième cavalier mort ?  --------------------------------------------------------  second knight on the edge ! second death knight ? on échange un pion contre un fou pour affaiblir le roi adverse ? alors c'est ce qu'on nomme un sacrifice spéculatif, le plus souvent à éviter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  we exchange a pawn against a queen to weaken the opponent's king ? so this is what is called a speculative sacrifice, usually to avoid. menace de mat en h7 ! beaucoup de défense possibles !  -----------------------------------------------------------  threat checkmate in h7 ! many possible defense! les noirs ne voient pas la menace de mat !  -------------------------------------  blacks do not see the threat to chechmate ! le baiser de la mort en treize coups ! pourtant avec un cavalier si proche de leur roi il devrait à chaque coup se demander si il y a menace de mat ... moral de la partie : évitons de laisser l'adversaire poster un cavalier si proche du roi !  -------------------------------------------------------------------  the kiss of death in thirteen shots ! yet with a knight so close to their king should every time whether there is a threat mat ... moral of the game: let's not let the opponent post a rider so close to the king ! 
-------------------------------------
a quick 10 move game that illustrates some of the pitfalls of eating too much material when facing the traxler. the king in particular eats well, but dies with a full belly.... a familiar first few moves  white advances the knight to threaten blacks pawn on f2 black ignores the threat and lines up his own attack the white f2 pawn  white takes the pawn on f7 and forks blacks queen and knight. not the best move for white....but let’s see how it works out black hits back with a capture on f2 checking the king the hungry king takes the bishop and is now exposed to a range of potential attacks the black knight jumps in and the king starts to move up the field  the queen joins the action and white needs to play carefully to avoid the gathering storm white presses on with the material advantage, but eight move in all is lost the king is forced to continue his march again white claims material advantage by chewing up the knight the lawn checks the king, forks the bishop and frees up blacks dangerous lsb whites final mistake the game is over with 11 of the white pieces still unmoved.   
-------------------------------------
a pesar de que nunca me he enfrentado a esa defensa decido proseguir con mi idea inicial: apertura italiana. hay que contrarrestar el poderío de su alfil negro: c3. con d3 defiendo el peón de rey y abro la diagonal para mi alfil negro. gano un poco de espacio por si su idea es iniciar un avance en el flanco de dama. cf1. hay que empezar a atacar el enroque ya. con la mayor cantidad de recursos posibles. como iba diciendo, hay que atacar con todo... incluso renunciando al enroque. su peón en h5 interrumpe la acción de la la torre, así que hay que buscar una buena ubicación para ella, siendo g3 un punto que no puede atacar. hay que echarlo de ahí. atacándolo. cubre el punto f7 y ataca mi peón de h4. mi alfil blanco pierde influencia, pero antes debo defender el peón. ¡ qué remedio ! defenderlo con cf3 implicaba obstaculizar la diagonal blanca que controla la dama. error. voy a clavar ese caballo. a ver qué hace con su dama... otro error. me garantiza una pieza a buen precio. habrá que estar atento al punto g2. cierro el centro y mi alfil irá a b1 para controlar la diagonal que va hasta h7. aparta la dama restando un defensor al caballo. pieza gratis. no creo que renuncie al otrora poderoso alfil negro o su rey quedará muy desvalido. hay que atacar más. a su dama, por ejemplo. y de paso bloqueo el peón de e6. lo ve. el caballo en esa posición es un monstruo. inatacable. supongo que tomará el peón tan molesto de f6. ¿ ? consolido entonces el punto f6. comienza el asalto final. no calculo en profundidad porque instintivamente percibo que un contraataque en el flanco de dama no prosperará. capturar el alfil implica perder la dama y sufrir un peón en f7. tomar el peón con la dama abriría la séptima fila y la dama negra podría auxiliar a su monarca. tomar el peón con al alfil abre más posibilidades. dudo. ¿ prosigo mi ataque o me defiendo ? y ahora, ¿ qué pieza defiende mejor al rey negro ? la torre. no quiere abandonar. le daremos mate. si el rey toma mi alfil negro dama g5 mate. si su peón toma mi alfil blanco dama g6 mate.  
-------------------------------------
1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5 black declines the queen's gambit and offer's the albin counter-gambit with d4. 3.dxe5 d4  i accept the offered pawn. black is prevented from dxc4, due to qxd8 kxd8 losing the ability to castle. black pushes his pawn forward into my centre. 4.nf3 nc6  i attack the pawn, black defends it. 5.g3 be6  aiming to fiancetto the light squared bishop and enable castling. black's bishop threatens bxc4 6.nbd2 qd7 nc3 is prevented by black's pawn on d4, but nbd2 also defends against bxc4. black develops queen to enable queenside castling.  7.bg2 o-o-o  i fiancetto my light squared bishop to build up pressure on the centre (xray on e4, d5, c6). black castles long. 8.o-o h5  i castle to defend my king. black threatens my kingside with his h-file pawn. 9.nb3 h4 - inaccuracy this was an error and i lose the previous positional advantage i have. computer analysis puts this at -0.12. the pawn on c4 is undefended bxc4 puts me a pawn down. qa4 would have been better. however, black has opted to continue his kingside attack. 10.nxh4 nxe5 i need to get rid of that pawn, doing so loses the defense of e5 which is then taken by black. i have lost control of the centre, and the kingside. 11.bf4 nxc4  i develop the dark squared bishop threatening bxe5 and looking to control the diagonal increasing the threat on black's queenside for a later attack. 12.rb1 bd6 – mistake! worried about nxb2 which would also threaten my queen on d1 i rush to defend b2 with my rook. computer analysis puts this at -0.64. however, bd6 was also a mistake, this time on black's part (+1.66). ( 13. qxd4 b6 14. bxd6 qxd6 15. qxg7 would have provided me a + 2 pawns advantage). 13.qxd4 kb8 i have noticed black's error and taken the pawn that was threatening my position. black's king defends against qxa7. 14.rfd1 bxf4 – mistake! rbc1 is better. qxg7 would have been too greedy as bxf4, gxf4 weakens my kingside defense. (14 rbc1 qc8 15. bxd6 nxd6 16. qxg7 nh6 would have won me the pawn after dealing with the bishop threatening f4.). black takes my bishop. 15.qxf4 qxd1+ - inaccuracy! better was qxg7 (15. qxg7 qxd1+ 16. rxd1 rxd1+ 17. bf1 be5 18. qf8+ bc8 19. qc5 bh3 20. qf8+ bc8). black goes for a sequence of exchanges while i am under check losing tempo with pressure building on my kingside.   16.rxd1 rxd1+ 17.bf1 nf6 this was forced. black develops his knight to aid his attack on my kingside. 18.nd4 nd5 – blunder! computer scores this as -6.27. i should have gone with nf5 to defend my king. nd4 did have the aim of attacking the bishop on e6 which was threatening bh3 (can't take it with my bishop due to the rook on d1) but i overlooked a quieter move which would have been more useful. black threatens my queen. 19.qf3 bh3 – blunder! i am now at -10.99. i should have attacked the king with nc6+. if black responds with bxc6 then i can reply qxc4 putting my queen in a position to better defend my king and threaten a king/rook fork with qb3+. i had also missed the threat of bh3 as my bishop is pinned by the rook. 20.ng2 nd2 – blunder! -23.92. i am clearly done for. nd2 forks my queen and the pinned bishop. i have to lose my queen to temporarily survive. if i try to save the queen then rxf1 is checkmate. 21.ne3 nxf3+ - impending checkmate the game is lost, i can not prevent mate.  
-------------------------------------
ok, let’s start the end game... on move 7. when you pin a piece, attack it again. leaves the knight and rook hanging. looking to play g5 soon and kick the bishop a trade? sure =) pinned pieces should be attacked again. i need to take this bishop back, but i have time to harvest the d2 knight leaves the a1 rook vulnerable to a skewer the queenside pawns will never queen (king and two pawns are there guarding), but lets clear some space for my rooks to mate. build a wall that the white king can’t cross trap king on the 1st and 2nd ranks trap king on 1st rank forces king away from defense of d1. only move  
-------------------------------------
this is an unusual opening: doesn't claim any center, but does release the queen and light square bishop. ok, i'll take some center. pressure on c2 pawn, develop bishop outside pawn chain support bishop (...bxd3 4. qxd3 activates white queen) i'd like, perhaps to get the knight to e4. fxg6 works, too. my idea here is to use the fact that the rook is released and possibly castle queenside later. nbd7 looks interesting to trap (but not capture) white queen e.g. 7...nbd7 8 qxb7 nb6 it fails to 9 a4 ... 10 a5, though i can win the pinned pawn on b4 (my dark square bishop is x-ray attacking his dark square bishop) blunder. win the pawn, protect the bishop attack the pawn on c3. my idea is to try to trade queens on c3 or c4 after ...qc6 (i’m a piece up). i need to pay attention to my king safety (no threats right now) this stops my qc6 plan; can we trade on b5? ok, piece up endgame. c3 pawn is hanging. what to do about possible c4? i don’t mind trading pieces my original idea here was to snap up the f-pawn after king moves to back rank kd8,ke8,kf8 all lose the f-pawn now i get the pawn -and- checkmate 
-------------------------------------
one of my favorite openings. i prefer this opening, as it is more give more intersting play. also there are some variations where black gets into good positions this opening was popular in the eighties i believe. to be honest, i like the position, but i dont know it that well. i like the control black has over the e4 square. white loses too much time, however the position is closed, so black cannot profit quickly. aiming to break open the center with c5 or e5. nice move, now c5 can be countered with a5, weakening blacks b6 pawn.  trying to prevent weakening b6, but now c5 does not look very apetiizng anymore, since it would leave b6 weak. maybe black should have played nxg3 here, hoping for a strong field on e4. unfortunately it is the knight that should go there, so trading the knight defeats seems wrong at the same time. white slow response means black has a hold on square e4. well, nxg3 is out of the window now only now did i realise that ne4 is barely usefull. my plan was ne4 and qf6, but it is impossible because of f3 and the knight has no escape. preparing for an e5 breakthrough. white kings looks a little frail in the cente, but he will find no safety on either side of the board. if white had played e4 here, i would have countered e5, using the fact that his king is not safe on e1. preparing for e5. if white had played e4 i would have countered with f4, followed by e5. also if white tried d4-d5, it leaves the field c5 open for blacks knight. probably castling queen side 0-0-0 would have been better. the kings side is not safe enough for white hing. white his center is not a strong as it may seem. and since white must now castle kingside, black is moving on the kings die already. also black will soon attack the centre with e5 or d5, perhaps even c5. danger robinsons! it is clear white is in trouble, but this moves just cramps up his kings position. as a preparation for g4. black has a superior position, and the initiative. white has very few ways to open up on the other side of the board himself. white has little choice but to try and do somehting before he is being overrun. not a bad move actually. there a resome clear positional disadvantages to exchanging the pawn. as will become clear in the rest of the game. i did not expect this a strong move, taking advantage of the fact that e4-e5 is not possible. after e5, bxf3+, re2, qd7, exf6, g5-g4! white is in serious trouble.  black move gives him a considerable positional advantage. both e5 and c5 great positions for his knight, and the thread g4 is still present. if black can occupy e5 with his knight he will have a superior position. black has a superior position. he now abandons immediate tactics, and aims to put his pieces at better positions. now if i can get the knight to e5 or c5, things are looking great. white does have a counter with c4-c5 though. this move seems stronger then the obvious ne5. from here the knight blocks c5, and aims at both a4 and e4. the plan is still to break through with g5-g4.  black can easily wins a few pawns, but i am in no hurry. i considered it a winning position already. putting even more pressure, and bringing the bisshop more into play. white may have to play ra1, moving his rook away from the zone of the most imminent danger.  as a side effect, rg1-d1 is now not practical because of bxa4, winning the exchange. however i would not take the exchange, considering my knight and bisshop are more valuable in this position than the white rook. here we go, the time is right. black cannot answer bxf4 because gxf3 would finish him off. simple and effective stronger than qxc5. nothing can stop the march of black's h-pawn now. meanwhile black's kingside is secure, since white does not have time enough launch an attack there.  last attempt, but c5 is secure since black queen will make it to the diagonal g1-c5.  game over, well almost... white surrendered, after ke1, qe3, kd1, qxg1 his last hope against blacks king is gone, since c5 is safe.

computer analysis of this game is available at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18564045&rnd=0.21791306044906378  this game was an open challenge as part of my attempts to get my rating back above 1500, as it turned out it was one of the shorter games i have played for a while in that it was all over in twenty moves.  the game starts with my favoured english opening bellon gambit which i don't have much experience of so i thought i would give it a try this is an unusual move for me but i wanted to reduce the risk of doubled pawns on c qc2 is another option here but i was happy to have the chance to bring my b pawn to c this takes us out of the gameknot database which favours developing one or other bishop. the computer calls this a mistake preferring bc5 while this pin can easily be broken i think its irritating for black. the computer prefers qa4 here. i like the threat of d5. last chance to play it before the knight can escape threatens qxc6 which i am happy with due to bd5 skewering the rook at this point i realised that if i could get the black queen away from the a4-e8 diagonal he would be in trouble due to the threat of qh6 he takes the bait, the computer now claims mate in 8  … qxc3 18. qh5 rf7 19. qxf7 be6 20. bxe6 qxc1 21. rfxc1 rf8 22. ng6+ hxg6 23. qxg6 rf7 24. bxf7 bxa3 25. qh5# now the threat is ng6# thanks for reading please comment 
-------------------------------------
did black just block its defence of it pawn? better to play the calmer e2-e3 poor, black’s knight will come to c6 solving blacks problems and creating quite a few for white. that does not solve anything and black will soon have white in chaos. i  white can no longer castle, and that’s a real problem. luckily white can play qc2 with quite a few threats: qxb7 mate and knight to e6 forking black rook and queen. an early xmas present. checkmate. black should have continued 15. ... re8 giving it’s king an escape route. there is various calculations to make. but i think white’s attack on black’s king will eventually peter out, and black will finally be able to make white pay for its poor opening play. or maybe white has pulled off a magnificent feat of escapology.

i think this is the soundest continuation for white. the older 4. qc2 prematurely activates the queen. 4. bd2 is too defensive and places the bishop on a poor square. 4. a3 forces a retreat or exchange, but neglects development. this is playable, but i like 4...c5 or 4...o-o. not many people play 4...bxc3 any more, but it was fashionable some 50-60 years ago. it seems to prematurely commit black to a plan that may not work out. the plus is that it doubles a pawn, but really that's not much of a weakness for white and may even be a strength, since he gets a big central pawn mass to control the center squares. mencik-golombek, england, 1931, continued: 5...d6, 6. bd3, c5, 7. e4, e5, 8. ne2, nc6, 9. o-o, qe7, 10. f3, b6, 11. be3, o-o. white has the advantage, but black's position is not bad. my old eco gives 5...d6, 6. bd3, bb7, 7. f3 (7. nf3, ne4 threatens ...f5), d6, 8. ne2, nbd7 (8...nc6, 9. e4, e5, 10. o-o, qe7, 11. f4 favors white: ivkov-lombard, bath, 1973), 9. o-o, qe7, 10. e5, a5, 11. rb1, e5, 12. ng3, g6, 13. f4, good for white (farago-puschmann, hungary, 1971). i much prefer something like 6...c5. white wouldn't dream of tripling pawns. anyway, black could recapture after 7. dxc5, qa5. 7. ne2 or 7. f3 could be played. black will miss his chance to challenge the center. 7...d5 was called for. 8...ba3 is an interesting try. but here, the bishop is practically useless. now white makes his push: too late. his best try was 10...ne4. this loses material. a quieter idea was 11. ba3, winning the exchange, but this looked like a sound sac. or 12...kg6, 13. qg4, f5 (13...nf6, 14. exf6, qxf6, 15. ne4+, kh7, 16. nxf6+, gxf6, 17. qh4+, kg6, 18. qh6+, kf5, 19. qh5+, ke4, 20. qf3#), 14. qg3, f4, 15. bxf4, rxf4, 16. nxe6+, kh7, 17. nxd8. black could resign. the only possibility. gameknot's computer analysis:  mistake: +5.88 » 17. rfe1 na6 18. cxd5 cxd5 19. re5 raf8 20. f3 nc7 21. rae1 rf5 22. rxf5 rxf5 23. qg4 rf7 24. kf2 a6 25. f4 best: +7.25 » 17. qe8+ rf8 18. qxe6+ rf7 19. cxd5 cxd5 20. qe8+ rf8 21. qg6 nd7 22. rfe1 rf6 23. qd3 rf7 24. re6 raf8 25. f3 kh8 26. rae1 a6 27. re7. i did consider 17. qe8+, kh7!, and then what? 18. rfe1, na6, 19. qa5+, kg8, 20. qg4, re8, 21. cxd5, cxd5, 22. re3, nc7! anyone see improvements here? if 18...exd5, 19. re7. black's weaknesses are his h-file and his e-file, especially e6. white eyeballs both. so far, one rook defends both. the queen has amazing mobility and range, especially on the white squares. watch as she swings right and left and penetrates the seventh and eighth ranks. i toyed with the idea of 23. rg3, but black seems able to defend, for now, the g7 square. the text move obviously threatens 24. f5. or 23...g6, 24. g4, reh7, 25. r1e2, bc8, 26. f5, gxf5, 27. gxf5, exf5, 28. qxd5+, be6, 29. rxe6, rxe6, 30. rxe7, nxe6, 31. qxe6+. once again threatening the e6-pawn by pinning a defender. the queen incidentally gets into a position where it can wreak havoc on the queenside. winning more material. consolidating. white can't play 27. qxb6, e5! pinning the knight again. it's really potentially the most dangerous piece, so i want to keep it dormant! since all the files are at least half-closed, i have to create trouble on the e-file and the fifth rank, where i can move to the g-file. black is hallucinating. he won't have time to create a real threat. aiming for g7. the problem with giving up the knight to attack the h2 pawn is that white's response immediately threatens mate, whereas black's taking of the h-pawn would not be a check and so would not require an immediate response. gameknot's computer analysis: blunder: +mate(7) » … rfh6 31. qxf8 rxg3+ 32. hxg3 rg6 33. rh5+ rh6 34. rxh6+ kxh6 35. qh8+ kg6 36. rxe6+ kf5 37. qh3#. best: +7.38 » … kg8 31. qe8 g6 32. a3 kg7 33. ree5 rf7 34. rxe6 nxe6 35. qxe6 rh6 36. f5 rf6 37. qe7+ rf7 38. f6+ kg8 39. qe8+ rf8 40. rxg6+ rxg6.  this is the most colorful way to win. of course, 32. rxg6, kxg6, 33. rxe6+ might even be quicker, but i just liked this move! black can't take it, of course. as i suspected, gameknot's computer indicates that this move actually delays mate by a move. though it does not give the moves, i suspect the best continuation is 32. rxg3, kxg3, 33. rxe6+, kh7, 34. qf5+, g6, 35. re7+, kg8, 36. qf7+, kh8, 37. re8# (or 37. qg7#). ha! yes, we could have wiped out all the rooks, but this is quicker. black's move is forced: black is officially in zugzwang. so, he resigned.

la reti inglesa me parece mejor definir mas tarde donde colocar este caballo evita cg5?? mejor era seguir con el desarrollo ae7 por ejemplo tambien podian jugar cc7-ce6 no me decidi por tcd3 porque las negras pueden mantener su caballo centralizado doblando torres y amenazando entrar en 7ª  
-------------------------------------
back in my teenage/early 20's years i always played 1. e4. (except when i was goofing around i would play 1. g4). then i went through a long period in my life when i didn't play at all. a few years ago i started playing computer chess and found that my style has pretty much changed. so i'm bouncing back between 1. d4, 1. b3, and 1. c4. so far my best success has been with 1. b3 actually. huh? in too much of a hurry to double white's pawns. the gameknot analysis computer puts white up by 0.93 here. probably not best. maybe qe2 to keep the option of putting the qb on f4? after this move, white's advantage has evaporated to 0.08 judged to be an inaccuracy by the computer, which gives  … ng4 13. bd2 nc5. i had been so engrossed with noticing that ... nxe4 doesn't work that i didn't even consider this obvious move! nevertheless the computer calls it an inaccuracy, giving this line instead: … ng4 14. nf5 nxe3 15. fxe3 qf8 16. rf3 o-o-o 17. qa4 g6 18. ng3 kb8 19. qb5 a6 20. qb3 rc8 21. a4 qe7 22. rf2. that would have been an interesting game! ... d5 was necessary. ... kc7 was better. this move seemed so obvious to me that i missed the better rxf7, qg8, 19. qa4! a mistake. the computer gives … nf6 21. bf3 qe6 22. rd2 ba6 23. be2 bb7 24. a4 nxe4 25. rdd1 bc6 26. bf3 qg6 27. rf2 h5 28. bxe4 qxe4 29. qd6+ ka8 the computer gives … bxe4 23. bg4 kc7 24. rfd1 bc6 25. rg6 ba4 26. rf1 rg8 27. rf7 e4 28. be6 rd8 29. rgxg7 h5 30. bd5 bc2 31. rh7 bb1 as black's best line computer calls this a mistake and gives rg6 as best (see next note) the computer gives … nf6 25. rxd8 bxg4 26. r1d6 nxe4 27. rd3 nf6 28. ra8 kb7 29. rh8 be6 30. rd2 bxc4 31. rf8 a6 32. rfd8 ne4 33. r2d7+ kc6 34. rxg7 bxa2. instead of 26. r1d6 i had been planning to play r1d3. black's actual move loses quickly. black tosses in the towel here. a game with plenty of mistakes on both sides. i thought it was fun because i've never had a pawn structure quite like this one! 
-------------------------------------
en udda öppning kp (c20), napoleon's opening helt ny teori, och jag går på känn. 2. nc6 är det vanligaste draget med 40-40 lika. vit följer teorin med 54-18 till vit. fortsätter att spela intuitivt och draget finns i world book med 50-50 lika. -1,53 vit lämnar teorin. -1,34 öppnar upp spelet i centern, men vit har tre anfallare på d5 mot mina två. -1,23 och jag utvecklar med attacker. -1,25 och svarts bästa drag. -1,35 något starkare hade varit att parera med qg3. -1,24 ett långsiktigt drag som parerar b7. men bäst hade varit qe7 tätt följt av bondelyftet till e4. -1,55 vit försenar sin utveckling och förlorar tempo. -1,63 och bästa tillflykten. behåller kontrollen ner mot vits planhalva. -5,73 vit inbjuder till en skevis och och förlorar såväl tempo som material. -6,08 och svarts bästa drag. -5,97 och ett givet kap. -15,21 och vit har för bråttom. mindre uselt hade varit qxe5 -5,82 och även svart har för bråttom. här hade 10...rg8 varit rejält vinnande. min springare skyddas av d och mitt t hade skyddats av min s, och sedan hade jag gått ner med rxg1. -6,45 och den rätta pareringen. hade jag parerat med d så hade vits d kunnat nästla sig in med qxf7 + och skapat stress. -7,01 allt lugnt, men jag vill helst få hem min k så här tidigt i spelet.  -7,21 och svarts bästa drag i det här läget. min k kan sedan söka skydd bredvid s utan att vits d kan komma åt. -7,53 och den väntade schacken. -7,70 och nu ser det lugnare ut. -10,67 vit gör ett banaldrag och förlorar tempo. här ser jag att min l på h1 inte gör nämnvärd nytta, så den kan lika gärna utväxlas. -8,65 och vit har inte mycket att välja på. -6,10 och starkare hade varit att slå nxd5, för att sedan bygga upp ett avancemang mot vits planhalva. -8,89 och vit får inte fart på spelet. -7,75 och jag vill upp till vits planhalva. -5,15 och där gör mitt t mer nytta. -8,49 och vit underlättar min framfart upp till hans planhalva. -8,91 och fokus är nu flyttat över till vits k. -12,71 -13,88 och snart kommer min d att behövas för den slutliga nådastöten. -29,86 och jag övervägde att gå upp med ne4, vilket hade skyddat min l om jag schackat med t på h1. -15,82 och mitt övertag tillåter i princip vad som helst. -10,13 om vits k går till g1 så är matten snart ett faktum. -10,94 och fullföljer min plan att få upp min d i spelet. -10,81 och vit har inga underbyggda hot att komma med. -13,83 och en lam attack som snart är över. -14,16 och det är intressant att se hur vits d är inlåst av mina springare. här hade ett proffs satt matt i sex drag, men jag behöver några fler. min d till g4 hade satt igång ett snyggt mattnät. det blir matt så här också. det blir matt vad jag än jag gör, och som amatör tar man motståndarens d när chans gives. nu är matten nära. ett par sista andetag från vits sida. klappat och klart. napoleon mötte sitt waterloo ;-) 
-------------------------------------
det 5:e vanligaste svaret, och utgångspunkten för queen's pawn, mason variation (d00). statistiken ger 39-27 till vit. ett spontant drag utan kunskap om mason-variationen, och det känns rätt i utvecklande mening. det 6:e vanligaste draget med 30-46 till svart. vanligast är 2...nf6 med 40-26 till vit. det näst vanligaste draget med 28-44 till svart. vanligast är 3.nf3 med 38-27 till vit. det vanligaste draget,med 54-27 till vit. det 4:e vanligaste draget med 54-27 till vit. ut ur öppningsboken, där 4...e6 är enligt teorin.  bättre för vit hade varit 5. nf3, nu står det istället lika 0.00 +0,60 en tabbe. starkare hade varit att mobilisera t med rb8. -0,30 vit tabbar sig också, där 12. dxc5 hade varit vinnande vit timeoutade, men positionen är jämn. 
-------------------------------------
i opened with the french defense as black. nowadays i always consult the game database in the opening when i play here at gameknot. that has increased my rating significantly. developing the pieces towards the center. a knight outpost at e4 is well placed in the center. maybe better for white was qxb7 clearing the b-file for queen and rooks? the black pawn at c4 is weak and difficult to protect and will probably soon fall anyway! back at the outpost again! an alternative for black was here 16...nc3. but it will not lead to anything because of lack of protection of blacks knight! still pretty even. occupying the semi-open e-file with one of my rooks. also nice that the white queen is at the same file, maybe it can lead to something? the position of the white king seems already a little bit vulnerable? now it comes. but still without protection. the only good square for the knight. white is grabbing a pawn suddenly. but was it sound? white is grabbing another pawn. blocking the advance of whites both free pawns is necessary. threatening whites queen in the next move. blocking the pawns even more.  an alternative, probably better move would be nd5. now nd5 becomes  a necessity. now the blockade of whites c-and d-pawns can`t be more efficient. threatening the pawn at a5. advancing temporary solves the problem. but only very temporary! an interesting move! if white takes the offered knight, he will immediately lose his bishop at d6. hard to say if this really was a good move by me? i´m dubious, but if rejected the possibility exists of a knight fork at c4 in the next move! he falls in the trap. disaster! i missed my chance to take white rook at a5 with my knight! to try to compensate for my missed opportunity i forced myself to think really deep! chasing away my opponents queen away from the important task to protect the rook! check! white will lose his rook in the next move because of this fork! takes the rook for free! threatening my rook. probably ...qb5 would have been a good defensive move here, or first trade off with ...nxd6 ? ??? very bad "protection move"! misses totally pawn fork c6! my second very bad move in this game in a short time. trying to get the best out of the situation! now i also must defend so that pawn b7 not will go in queen. a bothersome task. blockade. at least i get rid of the very dangerous white pawn at b7. white is threatening mate in two. try to defend as good as i can. a pawn for free! counterplay. disaster for white! a winning fork at f5 will follow! with correct play i think it would have been drawish. white gave up here.

-------------------------------------
philidor's defence (c41) 3.d4 vanligast med 44 - 28 till vit. 3...exd4 vanligast med 42-29 till vit. 7:e vanligaste draget, med hela 62-12 till vit. 4...dxe5 vanligast med 62-12 till vit. här spelade jag det enda draget som är till svarts nackdel i world book 0-50 till svart. i gameknots databas ger draget dock 63-31 till vit. vanligaste linjen i philidor's defence (c41) bland amatörer, med 65-26 till vit. följer huvudlinjen utan att kunna öppningen 63-33 till vit. vanligast är 5...exd4 och näst vanligast är 5...nc6 med 71-23 till vit. vanligast är 6.d5 i philidor's defence (c41) med hela 50-9 till vit, medan 6.c3 är tredje vanligaste med 66-33 till vit. svart lämnar gängse teori, där 6...nc6 är vanligast med 33-66 till svart. analys ger 7.qb3 som bästa drag här med +1,90 för den ökade mark det draget vinner; men en rockad ger +1,49 så det blir mvg på draget ändå. här borde svart gå upp med 7...h6 och backa upp g-bonden rent instinktivt vill jag låsa in svart med 8.d5 och samtidigt pressa undan hans s från centern. +1,46 +1,59 nu borde jag verkligen ha utvecklat min d till a4+, eller  min s eller l till ett främre läge. mitt positionella övertag är dock så stort så vad som helst funkar. +2,71 med sikte på att konsolidera bondekedjan sedan med c4, men jag glömde min ljusa l i det resonemanget. svart hänger sin g-bonde, så den plockar vi hem. +2,75 här hade jag kunnat vara mer offensiv med bg4 mot svarts d, men jag har inte bråttom. bäst för svart hade varit att gå ut med nf6, för att sedan få sina pjäser i rörelse. nu tvekar jag inte en sekund på att pinna svarts d mot hans k, och sedan är definitivt partit mitt. självklart ! hade väntat mig f5, men det här snabbar endast på processen. så går vi ner och plockar hem svarts l på g7. svarts bästa drag, och han räddar åtminstone tornet. här hade det varit smartast att slå bxh6 för min del, för att samtidigt täcka f8. backar hem och lugnar ner tempot lite, men det är som sagt inte nödvändigt. övertaget påbjuder fortsatta offensiver och ett snabbt avslut. mer ett impulsförsvar än en reaktion på ett allvarligt hot; för det föreligger inget sådant. nu hänger även svarts h-bonde, så jag påbörjar operation upprensning. +15,11 och svart släpper partit. 
-------------------------------------
här tänkte jag mig en klassisk queen's gambit och var inställd på att möta 2 c4. queen's pawn (d00), stonewall attack, istället för queen's gambit. helt ny variant för mig, så jag fick tänka själv tidigt i detta parti. bygger upp bondekedjan samtidigt som jag försvarar d-bonden. vanligaste svaret på stonewall attacken är dock 2...nf6, tätt följt av 2...bf5 vars statistik är till svarts fördel. vit bryter mot grundregeln att s skall mobiliseras före l, men enligt statistiken är 3.bd3 till vits fördel i denna variation. vanligaste draget är dock 3.nf3. här går jag spontant ut med kungsspringaren för att utveckla pjäserna normalt. det visade sig vara det vanligaste svaret i denna variation, och statistiskt är 3...nf6 till vits fördel. här avviker vit från stonewall attacken, där 4.nf3 är det vanligaste svaret i denna variation. här transponerar proffsen till 4...c5 och får ett siciliansktliknande parti, men jag valde den säkra vägen och utvecklade ännu en springare. vit gör det mest lämpliga draget, och får ut lite mer pjäser.  här hade 5...bd6 varit det lugnaste och mest långsiktiga draget, men jag kände för att spela offensivt och utväxla vits l. som väntat. här bestämmer jag mig för att öppna upp spelet och gynna mina två l framför vits två s. en naturlig parering, även om 7.nbd2 hade varit mer gynnsam för vits position. nu får dock vit en stark bondestruktur. retirerar till bästa möjliga position för l och behåller kontrollen över diagonalerna. vit hoppas på att jag skall slå dxc4 för att därigenom kunna dominera centern bättre, och så här tidigt i ett parti hade jag nog inte förlorat så mycket på att ta c4-bonden. men jag vill centralisera min s och utnyttja utposten, vilket hade straffat mig om vit spelat 9. c5. då hade vit fått övertaget, så nästa gång dår jag tänka på den här positionen. säkrast är att slå 8...dxc4 ! vit spelar enligt mina dåvarande kalkyler och ger mig kontroll över centern när jag slår d-bonden. nu har jag godkänd kontroll över min centerdel och jag öppnar även upp för min ljusa l. här släpper vit kontrollen över sin centerdel och tillåter mig att ta befälet över hans mittregion. i det här läget har fördelen svängt över till mig, och vit har inga svar som kan vända partit i hans riktning. den minst dåliga pareringen vit kan göra, men jag leder med -0,49. här tycker experten att jag skulle gått ut med qg5 och ta initiativ, men jag ville fortsätta utvecklingen av pjäserna i lugnare tempo. kontrollen över 5:e raden med q hade nog varit strategiskt bra, och jag hade även kunnat sabba vits rockad med qxg2. vits bästa svar, och han är snart klar med utvecklingen av sina pjäser. här hade jag en tanke att blockera b5 för vits s, men förbisåg att min bonde på e4 endast är försvarad av min l; medan vit hotar med bägge sina s att ta sig fram den vägen. experten anser därför att jag borde försvarat e4 med 12...qe7.  experten ser detta drag som ett misstag och ger vit +0,53. vit utnyttjar mycket riktigt svagheten på e4, och nu har vit övertaget i partit. ett tappert försök att undvika utväxling av min l, eftersom jag planerat ett slutspel med löparna som huvudaktörer. vit tar kommandot över kungssidan, och experten anser att jag borde rädda min l genom att retirera med be6; men jag väljet att försvara den  (och positionen) istället. här väntar jag mig rockad på kungssidan, och jag är beredd att göra detsamma snart. vit gör en skum damsidesrockad, och den ser inte ut att vara till vits fördel. nu står hans kung svagt placerad längs c-filen, och det ska vi utnyttja ;-) experten tycker att jag skulle varit mer offensiv och spelat bg4, men jag ansåg rockaden lämplig just nu; och jag vill få fart på mina torn. här släpper vit det dubbla försvaret av e4, och svart skulle lätt kunna utnyttja övertaget genom 16...qe6; attackerandes bägge springarna samtidigt. datorn bedömer det som ett grovt misstag av vit och ställningen är -1,72. här har jag för bråttom, och missar att utnyttja positionen till min fördel. men jag är inställd på att få igång mina torn, och det får jag genom den kommande utväxlingen. enligt datoranalysen var det här mitt främsta misstag, men positionen står endast i +0,46.  bättre hade varit 16...qe6 ! självklart, och jag får snart ut mina torn. få fördelar egentligen med denna attack, förutom att jag mobiliserar mitt torn på en halvöppen fil. experten håller med om att det ändå är mitt bästa drag i det här läget. +0,36 vit siktar in sig mot min svaga f7-bonde, och hans s ser ut att vara sugen på att gå till e5 för att skrämma min d. bevakar e5 från ev trix från vits s, och ger samtidigt min d lite mer rörlighet. vit jagar iväg min l. den bästa rutan att fly till, så att jag inte blockerar min d och mitt t.  vit är på offensiven och har ett lätt övertag, men jag ser en svag s som kan angripas. skjuter även fram min position och skapar mer rörlighet. vits position är försvagad och jag kan börja ta initiativ igen. aktiverar min l med en attack och erövrar mer mark. vit bestämmer sig för att utväxla damer, och det stärker min position ytterligare. experten bedömer det som ett grovt misstag av vit och ger svart -1,17. bättre hade varit om vit parerat med 22.qf3 tveklöst det bästa draget i det här läget, och min position är rejält stärkt. nu kan jag snart aktivera mitt andra torn och börja angripa vits kung. bättre hade varit om vit parerat med 24. ne3, så hade han även blockerat mitt torns framfart längs e-filen. självklart, och nu plötsligt har jag såväl initiativet och det positionella övertaget. vit hoppas på en utväxling av bönder så att han också skall få upp sitt torn. det blir inget med den saken ! en snygg bypass till c5, och vits bonde på d4 ser plötsligt meningslöst placerad ut. skall han kunna promovera den framöver, och lär han hinna det innan jag börjar väva mitt mattnät ? - knappast ! vit hotar ånyo att komma upp med sin torn, men jag behåller isen i magen och undviker ett överlämnande av e-filen. vill han utväxla torn, så får det ske på e2. en skum reaktion av vit, och föga produktiv. en utväxling av torn hade varit bättre för hans del,men jag tackar och tar emot. upprensning av kanonmaten. vit förlorar mer och mer tempo, och det är dags att förflytta striden till vits planhalva. det starkaste draget, och även om vit utväxlar torn så behåller jag kontrollen över 7:e raden. vit släpper försvaret av h2-bonden. datorn bedömer det som ett grovt misstag av vit och analyspoängen ger -6,21. ett enormt övertag för svart. väck med den. fast datorn ger mig en stor poängförlust för denna girighet, och nu står det -2,81. ett rejält övertag ändå, så det får vara godkänt. vit hoppas förgäves på att han skall kunna förhindra min l från att gå in i striden. datorn ser en matt i 8 drag enligt: 30... bf4+ 31.rd2 rxe1+ 32.kc2 rxd2+ 33.kc3 rc1+ 34.kb3 be5 35.ne7+ kf7 36.a4 rxb2+ 37.ka3 b4# 0-1 slutstriden tar fart, och det här var precis rätt läge att ge den efterlängate schacken med löparen. vits undergång är snar.  vits enda flyktruta. han går in i en matt på 3 drag, där en parering med rd2 hade förlängt plågan lite till. nu är det matt i två drag. där satt den. en skön seger seger efter en ganska jämn kamp.

i wasn't sure what russel was going to play, but i'm not surprised to see the qpo.  erika has annotated games that started off this way, and it's a common move in the beginning.  in fact, erika, most often, plays 1.e4, but my student, sometimes, plays this first move.  her next move will be 1...d5 as i've told her that this is the most common to this move. i used to mark this move as dubious, but i'm not really sure that it is.  one thing for sure is that i, personally, find fault with this move and don't like it.  i don't feel the same way in 1.e4 opening, but this blocks russel's c pawn which is like a center pawn in qpo's.  however, i also know that it isn't super important since ion said that in a different annotation.  not only that, but gm susan polgar didn't say anything against playing nc3 ...nc6 after 1.d4 or 1...d5 which is how i also realized that it's not super important despite once being told that a gm lost by blocking his c pawn.  although i was told that by the very same player that i and others blocked.  and, up until i read ion's comment, i was very critical of that c pawn for 1.d4 d5 openings. i like this move a lot since it develops.   ? trying to attack it, but this is a mistake that will allow erika to win a pawn. ?? but, russel didn't think it did since he played this.  and, i can easily relate to how's he thinking since i thought the same way against kenneth_fiore_3 in one of our training games.  however, that way of thinking will cause the same problem that my way of thinking caused which is the lost of material since nothing is protecting white's ne4.  having said that, with best play from erika black can win, but this is where you have to take your time and be careful as coach stockel emphasized to me when i lost a tournament game that i ought to have won. trying to get counterplay, but what erika does next is how i also would've responded. very understandable since it forces the  before you continue playing on stop and take a breather, erika.  you have an opportunity to do more then just a remain which would almost force a win right away.  before you continue reading on, try to figure out how black should continue. as, charleshiggie would ask, "did you find it?"  unfortunately, you didn't play it, but i hope that after i said something above you played it out to find it.  right before i continue, i know why you played this since the idea was to continue developing and give you the opportunity to castle.  but, this is one of those times where development ought to have waited.  having said that, your best move, by far, was 6...bxg2! not only picking up another pawn but winning an entire rook, as well, with an overwhelming advantage for black.  in fact, white's position would be very near resignable, at this point. with this move, erika still has the option to take on g2.  but, she was worried about the pawn on c6, and took right away to pick up another pawn, as well.  the thing to note is that the pawn on c6 is no problem, even after winning the r, because if after something like 7...bxg2 8.dxc3, you'd have 9...qxd1+ (to prevent losing the q and stopping white from castling), then after 10.kxd1 bxc3 or 10...nxc3, (to prevent him from exchanging your ra8) his r is still trapped on h1.  and, no matter what russel does next, nothing stops 11...bxh1. preventing erika from winning a r, even if she plays 9...bxh2, which still would've been the best move since it wins, yet, another pawn. but, she played this to free up her bf8.  remember, that as with other games, there's more to the eye here then just development.  in fact, it also boils down to seeing the overall picture, as bhidragon emphasized to me.  so, the thing to ask yourself, way to think is, what's going on here, where am i going, and what i can i get.  that's in addition to seeing other things like as ion points out tactical motifs including the masked battery.  those kind of things, sometimes, takes precedence over development.  and, the reason for me emphasizing this was due to my most recent game against bhidragon that i lost.  it was due to me thinking about how to free the c pawn to enable my nc6 to come out since it was also a d4 d5 opening.  so, i played either 12...c6 or 12...c5?? which immediately got my q out play and allowed him to swarm in with 13.qh5!, after which i lost because you had his q and then 2 or three other pieces to come in and attack my k.  that's what also enabled him to continue the attack by sacking his b.  so, the point then is what it is now, try broaden the spectrum and look at everything that's happening and not just development.  i know how difficult and even painful that is, but this is also extremely important to becoming a better chess player.  believe it or not, one of the main things that helped me with this was a sentence from a chess quote from gm susan polgar.  …"the pain that you're suffering today can the pain you are suffering today can bring you a lifetime of rewards."   bringing his n to a better square. but, this was not the way to do.  i know that you're plan was to continue developing and place your opponent in check.  but, remember that it's sometimes not a good to play the check, and you're ill advised to do it just because it's possible to put your opponent in check.  the problem here is that russel can gain a tempo. having said that, his best move was 11.c6. this wasn't the best move either, although it does liquidate while ahead, which is generally, to your advantage.  the problem is that your bishop was more active then his bishop, so i wouldn't have accepted the exchange, especially, since i was corrected for doing this kind too often by ken.  instead, 11...bc5 was better, and if he counterattacks with 12.f3 12...bxd4 13.fxe4 dxe4 which still picks up a pawn, and it also continues liquidating which is to your advantage. and, even though this protects the r, russel can no longer castle short.  but, he still has the option of castling long which i think would be risky.  on the other hand, i don't think he has anything better, unless you blunder which is all that white can hope for. ?? and, this is a blunder which russel should have exploited, and it's a lot more then just the n being on the rim.  before you read any further, find the best move for white, erika. well, hopefully, you found it.  he should've quick played 14.rxg2 which would've won back a b. going for h2 and pinning f7.  but, you should've retreated your bg2, since he can still take back.  but, as with before, russel overlooked 15.rxg2!   it generally is a good idea to castle early, but now was not the time to do that.  as with before, we need to be thinking about the overall picture.  in this case, what's happening since, unlike before, russel will take advantage of the opportunity to grab on g2, winning back material. ? i don't know why erika played this, but best was 16...qh3 not only attacking the r, but allowing black to pick up a pawn on h2 when white retreats.  this would've left her the equivalent to a piece up without compensation, but it's better then that, as we're talking about 3 pawns up, as opposed to, just a minor piece.  ion noted 3 pawns are usually worth more then a b or n which is of same value.  and, the reason behind is due to what the pawns are capable of in the endgame.  having said that, this is also a mistake as white can win back a pawn.  try to figure out how, erika. !? the idea being is that if i can't castle short, i'll do it long.  that's how russel was thinking.  but, best would've been 17.qxd5, and now even if erika is to play 17...qh3, for the reason outlined earlier, she isn't able to win another pawn. i understand this move, but russel will use the opportunity to grab on d5. wanting to exchange q's.  but, the thing to note is that, unlike before, you're only up a pawn now.  while 18...qh3 was still the best move, better then what you'd play would've been to attack the q with either r, 18...rad1 or 18...rfd1, and then after retreating and then exchanging with 19...rxd1+ 20.kxd1 almost as strong as ...qh3, would be 20...qh5 pinning the n which would tie down white's pieces.  and, that's generally, not a good way to go when we're nearing the endgame.  with this move, erika's position is about to become passive which is not so good either.  ?? i'm not sure what russel was thinking, why he played this.  but, it's a serious blunder on his part.  in fact, as chesskingdom64 would say, "almost anything was better then this move?"  take a moment and try to figure out how black should respond, erika. this is not easy to see, and i've overlooked this myself.  but, your best move was 21...exf3 e.p., which would've won a piece.  and, this time, it would have been without compensation for white. going after the n. ?? but, this is a terrible move, and i know why erika played.  as with before, it was, simply, to place russel in check.  can you figure out why this is a blunder, erika? ? the reason being is that russel should've answered with 23.cxd3 not only compensating for lost material, but now, he'd be the one who's the equivalent to a pawn up.  having said this is a mistake, why is it so, erika? it's very easy to overlook it, but your best move was 23...nxb4+ picking up another pawn through a discovered check.  with this move, russel will prevent erika from winning another pawn on his next move. going after the n which won't do because of erika's next move. ?? this is a blunder, and with that, how can you exploit this erika? it looks difficult to near impossible to do this.  but, the answers is with what ion calls the masked battery.  and, with that 26...nxf4+ was the way to go.  this fork might look ineffective, but with russel in check, there's no way for white to protect his rg2.  with that erika would, as with a missed opportunity before, be up an entire r and pawn.  and, since this is an endgame, he'd have very little to no chance of counterplay. going after the n, but this allows erika to play the masked battery which she'll take advantage of, this time around.  not only that, but she will further exacerbate white's situation by rightly taking the r on g2.  at this point, unless erika err's, white is now busted. ?? having said that, this is a blunder, erika that should allow some counterplay.  how can russel do that. with 30.kxg2. trying to prevent russel from getting a passed pawn.  but, best was 30...rd2, pinning his ne2 which would've also prevented him from winning back the n. still missing the opportunity to grab her n. likewise, she fails to see that it's en-prise.  and, this continues for a while, back and forth. in fact, erika wants a2 which would've also been available later on since there is no way to protect it, afterall.  likewise, russel still forgets about erika's ng2.  in fact, her best move was 33...nxh4, winning, yet, another pawn. and, with this last oversight, erika will protect by grabbing h4, this time around. trying to do what he can for counterplay. and, erika's telling russel that it's too little too late with this move. in case you're wondering, erika, this is a skewer which is the opposite of a pin.  as now, he's forced to pull back his n which enables to get, yet, another pawn. i like this move, but better was 39...f3+, and russel gets out of check, you'd be able to continue advancing your passed pawn to f3.  however, the opportunity still arises after this move, but a promotion, i believe, would've be even sooner. better would've been 40.kd3 to prevent erika from pushing her passed pawn under grounds of 41.ke3, as now, it needs to remain where it is and not advance to prevent russel from grabbing with his k.  with this move, her next move is just as good as it would've been earlier, and she'll be able to promote soon. trying to stop further advancement by attacking the r, but it won't due because of erika's next move. as now, she will promote on her next move.   trying to figure out what else he can do russel dishes in the check.  and, what erika is also how i would've responded. not only protecting her pawn, but trying to push it.  i understand this attempt, but there's no need to do it, erika.  the reason being is that you're so far ahead that what you have is enough to checkmate your opponent.  what's, more is that the pawn is of no concern.  having said that, i would've played 45.qd1+.  as now, similar to the n+b endgame checkmate or those other mating patterns, i'd be looking for ways to confine the k into the corner, where it can't get out.  but, upon studying this, i would've been a little upset with myself since there's still a small way to deliver mate.  having said all of that, 45...qc1+ or 45...rc1+ was best, and with the skewer, you would've won his remaining piece.  that would've only left russel with his k against what you have which would make it very easy for you to checkmate. protecting his n with check. going after the pawn.  ok, erika, what's the best move for black here? i know how much you like these checks, but best was 47...qf7, trapping and winning his n. unlike before, you have something better then winning his last piece which would've ended the game at once, erika.  what am i alluding to?   ?? 48...qc4# which would've been mate.  this is a blunder that will allow russel to win back your r. going for a passed pawn, but you have so much material, that'd i'd first be thinking about the n, erika.  and, then, i'd go for a checkmate.  with that being said, your best move was, similar a couple of moves back, 50...qe3+!  with this move, russel will escape with his n, for now. still giving you the opportunity to skewer and pick up his n.  but, you have something better, although it's harder to see since it's several moves. and, with that, 51...qf7+ was better.  but, best was 51...qa3+, and mate is unstoppable.  for example, 52.kb1 b3 (pinning the k) 53.nc7 qa2+, forcing 54.kc1 which then allows 54...qc2#  making room for your passed pawn.  but, slightly better would've been 52...kd4, and the reason isn't obvious either.  the idea being is that your bringing your k closer to his monarch and your b3 pawn.  in fact, this is what makes the monarch dangerous in the endgame.  now, they're the near equivalent in value to the r.  and, it's not because of points like pieces or pawns.  it's because, in the end, the k can guide the pawn to a promotion, at best.  in fact, this is how i won a game against, at the time, a much stronger player since i was still a novice back then who even sm.  but, this is the worst case for white, and in this case, it works together with the q to confine his monarch to the corner where a checkmate then ensues. you still have the same idea, but like before, i wouldn't have considered anything else, besides, 53...kd4 for the same reason.  i also know that you're going to keep pushing the pawn until it promotes.  but, as a reminder, when you're far ahead like this, you don't need to promote to deliver checkmate.  instead, it's better to use what you have to do this.  the reason being is that going for a promotion when it's not necessary can allow your opponent to pull a swindle and draw with stalemate.  that's important because the last thing you want to do with a won game is allow your opponent to draw or even win.  something like that happened to me in one or two games and i was frustrated.  and, the first time i took the n+b endgame checkmate test, i failed by allowing a draw by rep.  as the idea from that course is the same thing that i'm telling you which is not to throw away a win.  in fact, this becomes very important as we get later on due to a miscalculation that could've allowed a draw of the same kind that i got in the test. having said that, now's even more of the time to really calculate to prevent a swindle, erika.  as it's important to realize that in a position like this, all it takes is one or two miscalculations to allow a stalemate which is where the monarch's in a place where it can't move.  but, unlike with checkmate, it's the only spot where it's not eliminated or checkmated.  in fact, right before the first game that i won, which was against the same opponent, i miscalculated and allowed a stalemate by maryrose.  at the time, i wasn't upset myself, but that's only because it was just after i learned some strategy in the game.  i'm not sure what the best move was.  i would've suggested a move to try and mate him which, i think would end the game in checkmate.  having said that, upon further consideration, i would've played 57...qh7 to trap and win the n. but, i also understand this move, erika, as you are going to checkmate.  in fact, this is what i would've suggested, and i was worried about white stalemating you.  looking at it further, i realized that it's not possible to do so.   i understand the checkmate ideas, and i almost overlooked this myself.  but, your best move was 60...q1b3# which would've been checkmate. best was 62...qec4# which was also checkmate. best was 63...qdc3+, and no matter what russel does next, it's mate in 3.  for example, 64.ka4 qb1, which prevents the k from moving but isn't stalemate due to the n.  so, then, for example, 65.nf5 qcb4#. now, we get into confining the k into the corner where it can't get out.  and, with that, best was 64...qb6+, which then forces the k onto the first rank, and then black can checkmate on the next move, with either 65...q6b2# or 65...qa1#  but, at this point, you'll need to be even more careful about not giving up the win.  as the position starts repeating, and once the same position repeats three times, russel can pull a swindle by declaring a draw by repetition. in fact, right here is where russel could and ought to have declared the draw by rep, since the same position repeated itself 3 times in a row.  in fact, that's what i would've done as black.  and, it's exactly what i did in a couple of hopelessly lost games against carl, including our last tournament game. preventing it now since the move is different.  and, with best play, russel has no more chances, which is exactly what happened.  there might have been, in between the last few moves, a mate in 1 which i'm not mentioning since you were able to keep that win and deliver the checkmate, erika. there are, however, a couple of takeaways, lessons to be learned from this game.  first, when you have so much material, it's not necessary to go for a promotion.  instead, you're better off using what you have to deliver a checkmate, erika, especially to prevent a swindle with a stalemate.  with that being said, the second lesson is that when you have a win, keep and don't miscalculate.  it goes along with what coach stockel said about underestimating your opponent.  otherwise, you could draw or even lose, an otherwise, won game which is the last thing that you want to do. 
-------------------------------------
i open with my usual king's pawn. he replies with sicilian opening. i develop knight, following the sicilian. protects pawn, following the sicilian so far. i check to develop my bishop and pin his knight or exchange bishops. he's in for bishops exchange. i go for it. recaptures. castle. my king is safe now and i'm ready for taking the lead. develops knight. opening up diagonal for my black color bishop, while protecting the pawn. develops his knight. challenging his knight. his knight escapes... not the best place to go, since he's being x-rayed by my queen and will be en-prise as soon as i remove my f3 knight. no point for me to leave my bishop there, i better retract it to attack the central d4. a blunder... this loses a pawn since i can sacrifice my knight to capture that pawn. if he captures my knight, my queen goes and capture his. if he saves his knight, i captured the pawn and can safely exchange knights... either way, he loses a pawn. i go for it. now my queen is ready to capture his h5 knight... that's why i said it was not the best position for his knight. he takes the sacrifice. i recapture and got myself a pawn. wants my queen to move. i retract it to this position. here is safe from knight range, plus, she makes way for me to seize control on the d file i'm about to open. he tries to setup a discovered attack from his black color bishop on my b2 pawn. if i allow it, he'll send his knight practically anywhere he pleases to (maybe to g4, to challenge my bishop), and then, if i capture the knight, he'll capture my b2 pawn and next my rock with his bishop... if i maneouver until then and instead of capturing his knight, i protect b2, then he'll have an extra time for his knight for doing yet another exchange by my bishop... discovered attacks are difficult to deal with once they've been put into motion. better prevent them. by playing c3, he no longer has a way to reach b2 by the means of a discovered attack, so, he won't be able to put his knight anywhere he pleases anymore. he tries to solidify his pawns structure. i'm all set for opening the d-file, so i pull the trigger. if he captures my pushed pawn, i capture with bishop and then his knight will be pinned against his bishop until he castles. and once i seize control of the d-file with a rock, also his d pawn will be pinned against his queen. i'll try to exploit all the pins i can to gain the center control and make way for my pawns through the center. he wants to keep me from pinning his knight,  while also preparing to capture my bishop and maybe to do a double attack on h2 once he places his bishop at e5. i see no major threat just yet, so i keep on my plan to open d-file. he recaptures, obviously not with d-pawn, or he will totally lose control on the d-file when i challenge his queen with a rock, and then his queen would be in real problems since she is overloaded also with defending his knight. i take the ready to open d-file. i just pinned his d-pawn against his queen. his c5 pawn is free for me to take now with my bishop. he is compelled to do anything about it. he now threatens me with a double attack on h2 by his knight and his bishop. he might take back the pawn i'm ahead, so i won't allow it. with this move, ne no longer can take the pawn and also i challenge his knight. whatever plan he has for his knight, he must do it now. captures my bishop, of course, that's my most dangerous piece at the moment. i recapture with queen, this way, i keep his c-pawn en prise once he castles. he castles... not the best moment to castle, his c pawn is en prise, since his d-pawn is pinned against his queen. i can take the pawn with my queen for free... but i don't do it. if i capture the pawn, he will get the lead of the game now once he starts challenging my queen with his rocks and he'll start adding pressure over my c and b pawns, since he has a bishop already attacking that diagonal. i better develop mi knight to d2 so i can take it to c4... if i put my knight there, he'll have to deal with my fork over his pinned d pawn and his bishop. since his d-pawn is pinned, his bishop won't be defended and it will have to abandon e5 and then my knight and rock will outnumber the only defender of d-pawn, the queen. a mistake, he should have prevented me from taking my knight to c4... so, nc4 it is. now, he has 2 choices, retreating his bishop and letting me capture the d pawn with my rock while i put his queen en prise, or moving the queen aside and let me go for the exchanges while also opening up the d-file. either way i will open the d-file, which was my original goal. he puts his queen in a place where she will capture a pawn of mine... if i go for the "free pawn" and challenge his queen with my knight, she'll recapture b2. i can't use the rock to init the exchanges or i will lose in the exchanges... so i have to take the bishop, so i can have a time to protect my b pawn. i take the bishop. if he takes the pawn, i'll just retract my bishop to c4 to fork his queen and already attacked d-pawn, so he'll have lost a whole bishop for no reason. he has to deal with my knight first. so he does. and i use the extra time to protect my b-pawn. his c pawn is en-prise, so he protects it. i fork his c and e pawns with my rock. he must use his queen to defend both, coz c pawn is under double attack from my queen and rock, and e pawn is now attacked by my rock. he protects his pawns. i take the chance to solidify my pawns structure... this is what gave me the winning in this game. soon you'll see why. of course, that rock is giving him a terrible headache, since he can't use 2 of his most important pieces now to defend those pawns. he will want to exchange it badly. i force him to do the rock exchange, or to give me full control of d-file, which will not help him at all. he goes for the exchanges, of course, but in doing so, he has allowed me to have a passed pawn in the d-file, while also keeping a solid pawn structure... so, i capture with my e pawn. see the difference in pawns structures. he has 2 isolated pawns (those will be weaknesses during the rest of the middlegame and once i convert the game into endgame). my pawns are perfectly coordinated and my passed d-pawn is already in the enemy territory... he of course will by all means try to keep me from advancing that passed pawn. but, in doing so, he failed to see that his unprotected queen is being x-rayed by my queen beyond his e pawn. i'll do all i can to disrupt his remaining decent pawn struct and to open up f-file now for me to start pressing on him. so, i exploit the pinned pawn. he might advance it, but then he would have to play f5 at some point to do a similar structure as mine in the kingside, but with the pawns that were supposed to be used to protect his king. i would use the some of the pawns in my own castle to distroy it and in doing so, shredding any defense he had left and then i would have a complete open area to do all kind of available tactics on a very weakly defended king of his, maybe mating him or gaining material advantage in the process. he might feel compelled to defend the pawn. so he does. but this will just enable my plans to open the f file. i capture. he recaptures with pawn, of course, he can't afford exchanging queens on this position and with my material advantage, and voilá... an open f file for me to start infiltrating the enemy territory. and the worst thing for him? 3 isolated pawns now. i do a preventive maneouver to keep his pawn from advancing until i can deal with it. he tries to bring his king into action. i seize the open file control. he won't allow it. but, this will make his king move before a waste of time, since whe will have to recapture with his own king, for his queen is busy defending his e pawn. i go for exchanges. recaptures... and i bring my king into action. the idea is bringing my king to e4 so he can gang up with my queen against his e pawn. his king will be too far from the action, or if he tries to come to the defense of that pawn, will enable all sorts of tactics to win pawns and to force queen exchanges in an open area like this. also i'm luring him to check my king, if he does, i protect mysef with my queen and then queens exchanges will be unavoidable for him. there's not much he can do with his queen. i consider this a waste of time. i'm not wasting time... i'm closing the back door for his queen to be completely unable to infiltrate my territory while my king goes for his pawn. not the best place he could put his king out of danger, but then again, there's not much places he can go, so i don't blame him. almost there, just moving my queen aside and then my king will be blocking the enemy pawn himself while my queen goes to infiltrate the enemy lines and makes way for my d-pawn to promote. he tries to keep his only non-isolated pawns structure the most solid possible. my queen has now seized control of the open f file, and makes way for my king to go attacking the pawn. that was not the best, now he'll allow my queen to go to f5 to attack the pawn while also keeping the greep on f-file. but first thing's first. my king blocks his pawn while i go for it. there's nowhere he can escape now from my advance... he tries to lure my queen to check him on positions where she will be captured. maybe works with a noob... not me. and, that's it, king and queen are both attacking the pawn now, and will take by the means of a check. guess he thought it was pointless to keep on defending it, and start using his queen to infiltrate my own position via b4-a3. but he won't have time for that. i capture and a check. not much place for him to go. yet another check. again, not much place to escape. but here he'll allow me to do queen's exchange, which of course i will do blinkless. fork, now he has to do queens exchange or lose his queen. he goes for the exchanges, of course, he has no choice. i recapture. he tries to bring his king to prevent my promotion. i think it was better for me to play ke5 here. this way if he played ke7, i would have played kd5, and he would have to either go back to 8th rank or come to f6. f6 would lose to me playing kd6, and then kd7, and then just pushing my pawn to promotion. if he went to the eight rank, i could safely capture his c pawn, and then return again to defend e pawn. but i failed to see that one. i thought i had plenty advantage to forfeit my e pawn and capture c pawn to make way to my c pawn to promote while protecting it with my king from b7. he comes to e7, and then i remember my a-pawn had a free tempo adjusting move at my disposal, which just came handy. so i use it, and now his turn to move. he has to go go back to 8th rank or allow a sooner promotion of my e pawn by playing kf6... of course, he'll prefer to deal with a more delayed promotion. i capture the pawn. he comes back to challenge my pawn. and i just go back to defend it. he has to fall back to 8th rank. and i make oposition so he keeps himself to the 8th rank. not much he can do. i could have played e7+ then he would play e8, i'd lose a time with my c pawn, he would try to do any other legal move than kf7 left, like h5, and then hxg4. at some point, he would have to play kf7, then i would just push my king to d7 and promoting my e pawn would be unavoidable, but that would make me chase his king to the h1 corner. so, i'd rather keep the king to the 8th rank while i threat with promoting c pawn, and then, once his king went to c8 to block the promotion, he wouldn't be able to prevent my e pawn promotion, and it would be easier to corner him in a8. he remains in e file, he can't just go to c file or e pawn would promoter egardlessly of whatever else he did. pushing the c-pawn. makes oposition. whichever pawn i advance now will have to be blocked by the king by going to his rank, and the other will promote. so, for me it will be easier to corner him at a8, and i force the king to come to c file, or be mated in the next move. he must play that, no choices or be mated next. now e will promote. he tries to lose tempi. i promote, check. only one place to escape. yet another check. my queen, king and pawn are now coordinated to push him to a6, with no other place to go. only move available. and since he can't go anywhare, i just need something to attack him. could be a queen or, in this case, a bishop. checkmate.

i managed to equalize the game right from the opening and in the middle game i was able to get a decisive positional advantage that would soon convert in to a promoted pawn... white in his effort to avoid this ended in a mate net! ruy lopez (c67), open berlin defence let's try a transposition to the 9th game of the match between kasparov and kramnik, london 2000, let's see what white has prepared for us... i'll add some comments by karsten muler (km), to my own comments about this game preparing counter-play on the a column km quotes here: 12.b3 bb4 13.bb2 bxc3 14.bxc3 c5 15.rd2 b6 16.rad1 be6 17.a4 ne7 18.ne1 g5 19.f3 nc6 20.kf2 ke7 21.bb2 rhd8 22.c4 rxd2+ 23.rxd2 bf5 0–1, fritz5-anand,v frankfurt 1998  blocking the e pawn white goes after the knight, and my king side is a bit restricted, hence the need to have counter-play on the other wing, eventually playing g5 and activating the h8 rook and black can hold the position...  km: this time kasparov takes energetic steps against the blockade on e6 and f5, which led to a draw in the first game.  ne7-d5, and black still has some problems to solve but should be fine blocking the open d column no the best option, in fact white exchanges my best bishop, but also by his best knight, so things are even there, but my e6 pawn will block white's e5 pawn severely restricting his remaining dark squared bishop, white derived from kasparov-kramnik with tempo now white has to remove the bishop from f4 and doesn't have the possibility of ng4 previously bg3 was played in a drawn game kindermann stefan (aut) - lalic bogdan (eng), portoroz (slovenia), 1998  freeing a5 for my rook, and preventing a4, now if white advances his a pawn it has to be placed on a dark square adding restriction to his bishop action and he does move a3 i need to get my king closer to the king's wing my weakest spot just a little bit annoying nothing further forcing the defence or advance of the c pawn so defence it is ng3-e4 is maybe white's idea offering the exchange of one rook with the possibility of bd4 or nxc4... preparing nxc4 ? allows me to block the d column again and on occasion more permanently than before... again nd5 block the open diagonal and now it's even harder to remove from d5, as white doesn't have the c pawn as a threat to it  now the c pawn is doomed... to get the a pawn, but i've rather prefer the c pawn over my a pawn any day a forced sequence now after kg2 b6 to prevent ra5 and have both the b6 and c7 pawns are restricting white's bishop i've considered also the immediate c5 retaining the connected pawns i really don't see the point of this move by white... he needed more a active move threatening something threatening both white's weak rook pawns, i've also considered ra5 to force the exchange of rooks and the resulting simplification, but i disliked white's counter play on the opposed wing forcing my king to be fixed to it's defence after which the bishop greater mobility compared to that of my knight might became a decisive favouring factor for white i needed to remove my king from the 2nd rank in order to be able to advance the c pawn, at the same time this move allowed me a better defence of the king's wing my first thought was nf4+ with the idea of kg3 to defend h3 then ne2+ with the idea of nd4 aimed at f3, but then i realised white had the simple bxf4 and after the forced gxf4 i might have had lost any chances with a rook endgame with only one extra pawn... ... so i proceeded with my plan to play c5 defends the b pawn and gets out of the way of the more advanced c pawn i'll end any counter play white might have here on the king's wing, forcing some pawn exchanges now white needs be1 ? does he intended to play rh6+ after kg6 or rh4+ after my kg4... totally hopeless moves just wasting time! now white will lose his rook, rh1 forced then i have c2 forcing white's reply rc1 to which i'll answer with rb1! then rxc2 forced and ne3+ with a double attack on king and rook wins the rook... the resulting technical endgame will pose no difficulties for black to win ? and now i'm safe rf6+ meets nxf6 losing the rook and the game and i have the powerful threat ne3+ followed by ng4 oblivious to ne3+ white keeps pushing his pawn let's lure him to play g7 ?? now i have a nice move ne3+ and all white king moves are losing, either allowing a promotion with check any move to the first rank (kg1, kh1); or allowing check with my next knight move ng4+ (kf2, kh2, kf3-discovered check) allowing then nxh6 preventing white's promotion; or even the more resistant kh3 after which both black and white may promote, but white's king position is inferior and is easily mated with qh1+ bh2 only nf1+ qg3 qxh2++ now all ends, white doesn't have any good move, he his lost  
-------------------------------------
this was a bird's opening, similar to other one in which i played black, i diverge from my opponent in the other game by avoiding to exchange my light squares bishop, and avoiding also damage to my pawn structure, then followed a good plan to fianchetto the dark squares bishop, and exploit black's constricted position. black's queen was soon trapped and black had to give up a piece to avoid losing his queen, due to heavily scattered pawn structure, a couple of advanced black pawns, and more active rooks consolidation was hard to achieve, but some poor move choices by black allowed the position to became slowly easier for white, until black finally lost all possible counterplay bird's opening, lasker variation, this was the second game with a bird's opening i play at the same time, now with white pieces, probably my opponents tried to confuse me, although it was my opponent in the other game that chose to play the bird's against me... this pin is the most sharp and probably the better reply to bg4 black shows he cares about the possible damage to his pawn structure after the exchange bxc6, up until now we were following larsen, bent - van geet, dirk, amsterdam, 1964 (1-0), the game continues with 5 0–0 a6 6 be2 (6 bxc6+?! qxc6 7 h3 bxf3 8 rxf3 e6 gives white nothing from the opening) 6...nf6 7 d4 ne4 8 c4 e6 9 nc3 rd8 10 c5 qd7 11 nxe4 dxe4 12 ne5 bxe2 13 qxe2 qd5 14 bd2 f6 15 nxc6 qxc6 16 b4! larsen spots the best chance to make progress by advancing the pawns on the queenside giving him the edge.   to protect the king and add another defender to the f3 knight with queen on d6 (or d7) i don't want to give up my bishop pair for nothing, so a retreat is the best option white has here this is a thematic idea for this bird's variation to fianchetto my queen side bishop to get a stronger hold of key square e5, unlike the other game i can follow this plan as black could not capture on f3 forcing gxf3 disrupting my pawn structure, also my c2 pawn is protected and black's queen is not a threat on d6 forcing black to decide, bxf3 would be bad now, as black light squares were somehow weakened by the previous move f6 i now have a small advantage, i keep the bishop pair, and my pawn structure is healthier than black's pawn structure black left the h pawn "en prise", the capture of this pawn can give me a precious advantage black is a bit cramped and my last piece is developed with an attack to d5 sow i'll try to set a trap to black's queen, profiting from black's cramped position ... finally i capture the pawn and in the process complete the trap on black's queen ? pointless, when the queen is in trouble, black should have been more assertive in providing an escape or launching  a counter-attack extending the fianchetto wins a piece for white blocks the attack, but loses the knight to d4 now with a material advantage (piece and a pawn), the strategy has changed, and i'll focus my attack on the castled king  avoiding the bg7, and placing the rook behind the c pawns, the idea is to play c4 to open some lines now i decided to try and lead black in to a series of exchanges according the the following variation: 20...exf3 21. dxc6 bxc6  - here black can also play 21...qxd1, leading to a zwischenzug move cxb7+ before capturing back the queen to further open the king's position...  22. qxd7+ - to attract the rook to d7   22...rxd7 23. nxa7+ - to coerce the king to b7   23...kb7 24. nb5 - sacrificing the knight to vacate c6   24...cxb5 25. c6+ - and the final objective to fork king and rook on the 7th rank   25...kc8 26. cxd7+ kxd7 27. rfd1+ here black can also play 21...qxd1, leading to a zwischenzug move cxb7+ before capturing back the queen to further open the king's position... to attract the rook to d7  to coerce the king to b7  sacrificing the knight to vacate c6  i was hoping for cxb5 to get to play c6+ with a fork on king and rook, missed this move... although i known it was possible for black to ignore the knight sacrifice! now after seeing black seizing the initiative i need to defend h3 to get the knight to f5 opens the f column, with tempo, so my rook can support nf5 forking the bishop and rook as referred before, now i aim to simplify the position and exchange as many pieces as possible so black doesn't have any counterplay  improving my bishop placement with tempo, now bd4 is a possibility to block the d column and protect both my e3 and c5 pawns freeing my c1 rook to other functions  threatens rxg2, and avoids the skewer rh1+ after: g4 hxg4 without the rook on c1 i can make this capture not fearing the skewer rh1+ only move, now if rh1 kg3 rdg1+ (rhg1+) rg2 and i've achieved consolidation and can start pushing my pawns, or even play bd4 first to secure my e and c pawns also 
-------------------------------------
the sicilian rossolimo variation, the best thing about this variation from white’s point of view is that it tend not to be as forcing as some other sicilian lines, so white can decide upon piece placement and long term positional plans. from black's point of view the pressure over d4 is reduces by bb5, as white can even exchange the bishop for the knight,  so we have a few possible choices here: a) 3...g6 so black can fiancheto the bishop and regain some pressure over d4 b) 3...e6 with the idea nge7, if possible before the exchange of white's bishop, then bb5 would lack it's point c) 3...d6 preparation of bd7, after exchange bxc6 bxc6, black would exert pressure over e4 d) 3...a6 in my opinion a bad choice, as it loses one tempo so white can exchange and black could have developed a piece or opened some lines with a pawn advance, in this case just lost that oportunity e) 3...qc7, also losing tempos with the queen not my first choice also f) 3...nf6, is at the same time a solid choice but also a very fighting one, richard palliser, in his book "the bb5 sicilian" called this 3...nf6 the fashionable line, due to several recent successful games with it, so this will be my choice for this game... and now a bit of unusual play dxc6 instead of bxc6 (we all hear to capture towards the centre), but dxc6 allow an immediate release of the light squares bishop, plus with the alternative recapture bxc6 and the knight on f6 white can threaten it to gain some edge as was seen in vescovi-milos, são paulo, 2002, black king would be vulnerable and white would get a great advantage the queen controls the key square e5, qc7 can also be done before 4.bxc6, but then the capture would also be dxc6! as i said the purpose of qc7 is to control e5... now this was a surprise, although limited in scope, white wanted to exchange both his bishops, as there was no pin behind bg5 forces decision... although questionable, i have some doubts about this move... as if it wasn't for this move 7.bxf6 gxf6 would have allowed bh6, i also had some doubts about 7...gxf6 were would i castle after it? with 6...h6 there is no point in gxf6, gxf6 would have weakened black king's wing for nothing, so now i need to castle and place my rooks on the semi open columns to prepare nbd2-c4 now both castle options are open, and the bishops are centralized prevents bg4... but there wasn't that option in my mind... i have the bishop pair and i'll stick to it, and playing bg4 without at least the slight possibility of bxf3 has no point... here it is the first rook on a semi open column ? this is a bad move it unnecessarily weakens the dark squares in white's field no i'll grab the initiative an try to create some tension in the centre, my doubled pawns worth close to nothing will now be put to some gain, if exf5 would have allowed me a more open game for my bishops nicely done to counter my rook so now my second rook in a semi open column now a new idea arises, from the need to relocate the bishop, lets try the main diagonal, and profit some from whites weakened dark squares on the queen's wing white has the same idea, to use the open dark square holes on his camp, but he is one tempo down opened the diagonal for the bishop and controls f4 now over protecting the e5 pawn and the idea nd6 might be present preventing any try against a5 it balances control over f4 but the h3 pawn is now another weak spot in white's camp now some tactics against the a1 rook can have place ?? moving the queen in to the line of fire, is not a good idea, nd6 is no longer possible, plus it loses a precious tempo in defence, several ideas to exploit here: a) 18...g4, to remove the defender nf3, but 19.nfd2 would call for 19...b5 20.axb5 cxb5, to remove yet other defender... b) 18...b4, better than the previous, as ncd2 is a possibility removing an escape square for the f3 knight c) 18...bxc4, i dislike the possibility if bxc4 opening a column for white's rooks d) 18...bd5, is the best, because it attacks nf3 at the same time opens the column for an attack by the rook on e5 and now the e pawn is lost for white late a temporary sacrifice to open the diagonal and recapture the queen a piece up, 19...rxd6?? loses the rook and the queen and give white a pawn in the 7th  this was a nice little game, i was a bit surprised by 6.bg5, and end up with a bit cramped position, with a bishop pair but seeing white manoeuvring his knights, finally the possibility to open some lines put white in trouble and forced a blunder, and thus my win. 
-------------------------------------
.white just blundered a piece right in the opening phase (move 6), but still managed to drag the game for 25 more moves, i've done some massive exchanges, but white defended stubbornly and forced me to play almost to mate (a mate in one in the last position)... my usual reply to d4 the more flexible option, fianchetto the bishop, just leaving to white the definition of his pieces to chose a way to contest them latter so here we have a grünfeld modern exchange variation... without the exchange part... as white didn't captured back?? ?? blunders a piece, obviously bxc3 is clearly better than the game's move to develop my pieces and cash in my material advantage, by exchanging as many pieces as i can massive exchanges to simplify the position connecting rooks rab8 follows getting my pawn back i don't mind exchanging rooks trying to pin my bishop unpinning my bishop with a threat over a2 chasing away the  queen is my priority now to consolidate the position more consolidation and white's queen is traped ? now forcing the exchange of queens recaptures the queen and attacks the rook ?? blunders a quality to my discovered attack no need to worry about the c pawn as i'm exchanging with check which allows the defence of the c pawn latter the best placement for my rook is behind the pawn, and it will stay there, while the other rook will force it's advance to promotion now the advance of the c pawn is decisive i expect 27.a4 rb4 gains a pawn, or if 27.ra4 rc7 defending both black pawns a7 and c5 defending both pawns and the promotion is inevitable white's king walk to the promotion square is of no use as it only shortens the win and mate in 1, the bad 7.qd3?? sealed the fate of white on this game.  some bad choices of moves, including an easy recapture that didn't happened allowed for a small material advantage, easily converted in to a won endgame. 
-------------------------------------
si inizia la posizione.. subito si arrocca? 2° arrocco c3? i cavalli neri sono in gioco! 1° scambio attacco!... ...contro difesa! non mangi? che errore! scambi! offer draw! patta! 
-------------------------------------
my opponent chosed the english opening. i feel that i have pretty good statistics against the english opening. i´m preferring to play e5 against c4. i´m threatening against the weak square f2. in the opening i´m trying to look in the game data base for improvements. that´s one of the advantages in correspondence chess, the possibility to look in databases. threatening e5 in the next move.  castling kingside. now can white win a piece with a pin. or can he? the only move i think? white has the better development! trying to prevent white from castling. a positional sacrifice! was rather intuitive. erasing whites pawn structure on the kingside. trying to develop my other pieces so fast as possible! whites king is stuck in the center! white is trying to overprotect the bishop at e2. finally giving up the castling idea. it´s not fun for white now! overlooked that pin! bad done of me. i´m now down with approximately a rook but still has the better pawn structure and king safety! a little trap. if the white queen is taking my knight on a4, then ...qe1 checkmate! falling in the trap! i was finally victorious! but look at the material balance, i´m down with approximately a rook and a light piece! interesting game! 
-------------------------------------
pirc attack!     as noted it's actually a defence that focueses around the four black moves: d6 nf6 g6 and usually bg7, and on white's side d4 e4 (or in a different order) nc3. white has a lot of options and kind of controls what will be the style of the game with the following moves (e.g. 4 f4, 4nf3 4be3 or 4 g3).  i'm trying to get into this with the book pirc alert by albert and chernin :) natural reaction from white, occupying the centre develops, attacks e4, most common move here in the pirc i guess defends e4 the natural way preparing to give the dark-squared bishop a home on the long diagonal uncommon variation? overdefending e4, developing the queen  as noted by chesscentral there would have been the possibility of: 4 ... sxe4 5 sxe4 d4 :) thx for the comment maybe developing to nc6 was attractive here, which also guards the critical point e5? developing, preparing to king-side castle pins the knight, attractive for a later nc6xe4 threat cracking up the centre, preparing a deadly king attack ;-) up to this point the game is equal i guess, however the knight needs to find a new home... ? a bad decision, as the knight has no future here (only c7 which is not free yet). it would have been happier on h5, even it's on the dim.   comment: my fear was that after nd7 e6 woud follow. of course fxe6 would yield bxe6 bxe6 qxe6+. i did not feel that comfortable with that thought... kh8 would have to follow since white could do ng5! well... :)  asks the bishop for a decision ! kills the defender of e5 and weakens white's king side. ?! interesting idea, white seems to plan queens-side castling and have an open g-file now. develops, attacks e5. however, the poor knight on e8 is definitely entombed now for a while... fixes the pawn on e5 ? for enabling f6, however it will soon be in a deadly bind... ... prepared by this pawn storm. threatens the deadly hxg6 ? gxh5 would have saved a bit longer i guess, however, after qxh5 it's lost soon anyway threatens mate in one only move was nf6, defending h7, however the game was already lost anyway pretty! 
-------------------------------------
my rival makes a irregular move, may be try out my opening´s theory. if black plays 3...  b6, with 4 c4 enter in petrosian system in qid after this move, black isn´t play b5. a punch to nobody. with 5 bf4, white controlling e5 and black must play with attention. with the game´s move, white can play e4. similar a colle system i analized re1. this move open the c-column for me. white pressure e5, with threat the e4 and e5 fourchette.  thematic advance. white now creates a isolated pawn for himself but try to attack in the kingside. forced, of course.  forced, too. if i no take the knigth, 17 nxf6 qxf6 and 18 ne5 and cannot nxe5.  i think what qxe4 was better. 17 qxe4 g6 and h6 and f6 squares are weaks will go to c4 or d5 lost time. threat nxe6 or qh5, but both are neutralized.  now, if 20 qh5 h6 winning a piece. the exchanges gives me this move 24 ... nc4 is an alternative. but i like this move, prevents 25 ng5 g6 26 ne4. may be 25 ... f5 it`s better, but i do not like create a weak pawn in e6. now, this move allows what i can force the exchanges, to go a bishop ending. i value adventage for me, because the isolated pawn in d4 an a3-b4 chain, all in dark squares. the ideal square for the king is d5. but, i cannot. good move, now, i can not plays kf5. if 32 ... f5 33 f4 now, with the king in the center, this move allows me create a passed pawn in h or blocked the white pawn in dark squares. if 35 g5 h5. bishop gives the place for the king, threats kd5 a passed pawn.  pressure, if 43 f5+ kc6 (not 43... kd7 44 fxe6+) and i am safe. white are in zugzwang?... may be, but i can´t affirmed that now, this move gives d6 to the bishop. try 44 ... a5 and if white does not takes 45 ... axb4 and 46 bd6 with two passed pawn, in both wings. i can choice too 46 ...bc3 47 kxe6 bxd4 48 f5 bb2 49 f6 bxa3 50 f7 bc5 to not blocked the a3 f8 diagonal.  
-------------------------------------
advance variation. french defence.  a new move for me. i knew 5. nf3 and 5. bd3. the 5 a3 variation and 5 ca3 transpossed, generally, to 5 nf3. attacking d-pawn. typpical for this variation. i was thinking about 6... h5 and 7 nh6. but this it´s too slow and weaking the kingside. prevents nf5 and allow the castle. the d-pawn is poissoned.7... cxd4 8 cxd4 nxd4 9 nxd4 qxd4 10 bb5+. now, i can take the d-pawn the white shows your plan, a3-b4 to controlling c5 square. i can play nc6-a5 to c4, but i do not like decentralising the knigth simple, but important, development. controlling g5 and allowed the short castle. consecuent. cxd4 it`s an alternative, but don`t like me. now, the white must choice about retake with the a or c pawn. if take with c, opening the column-c but can play the knigth to c3 (not now, clearly). here, i analized 11...bxb4 with 12 cxb4 qxb4+ and if 13 bd2 qb2. if 13 nbd2 nxd4 14 nxd4 qxd4 and attacking ra1 and f4, deffending a7 and white cannot castle blacks had three pawns for piece and threating ng4. but if white plays 13 kf2, the black`s attack it`s over. 13... ng4+ 14 kg3 and here it`s safe. if white plays 12 qd3 g6 with threat in bxb4. common move in the french. opening the f column this move weak the g3 square. white threats g4 but it`s inferior in development. now, fritz gives me the continuation 15... nxb4 with bb5. i analized only 15... bxb4 but falls 16 g4. protects h7. conceptual and tactics sacrifice. blacks have a superior development (see bc1-nb1-ra1) and the threats with bb5 or nb4. rook in c sees the bishop in c2, too. if 17 nxd4 rxf1+ 18 kxf1 nxd4 19 qxd4 qxd4 20 cxd4 rxc2 and black it`s a tempo more for rxc1. if 18 qxf1 nxd4 19 cxd4 qxd4+ and qxa1. may be, the queen is best in d2 i misscalculated for 20 ra7 rxf3 21 rxf3 nxd4 22 rf1 rxc1 23 rxc1 ne2+ 24 kf1 nxc1 25 rxa7 bb5+ and bc5. but, 22 rf1??, if 22 kg2 white it`s better. specullating for rxc1, winning a piece.  
-------------------------------------
white offers the kings gambit! i accept it, probably the best! threatening the bishop away with this pawn-push. check! starting an attack on whites exposed king. exchange of the queens nearly totally stop the attack!  chasing the bishop away! winning a pawn in the center! starting to develop new pieces for a new attack on whites king! i have a lead in development! this will lead to something positive for me! and there comes the rook! it´s never good to start wandering up on the board with the king. it´s dangerous, he can be mated or lose material when he tries to avoiding being mated! white can´t take back with the king. if he does that then bd5+ will win the white rook. a little tactical blast with the black knight!  winning material again!  black is leading in material with two light pieces! it seems like this game is lost for white! a big mistake! leads to bg4+! wins the rook! 0-0-0 leads to that my other rook will come in in the game quicker! and white gives up! nothing else to do.  
-------------------------------------
this is the london system, which is extremely popular on gameknot right now. white's setup is very solid, but there are plenty of opportunities to get aggressive at c7 or at the kingside. ?! this is unnecessarily slow. rather than preventing just one of black's many options for development, white should focus on activating his own pieces — either nf3 or e3.  black usually won't want to play …bb4 in this opening anyway (unless white plays some silly weakening move like b3) because the trade …bxc3+ just helps white — pair of bishops, c3-pawn supports the center, open b-file, etc.  white does make the correct decision to avoid nb5, which is just a waste of time after …na6. ! the most aggressive approach to white's slow opening play. this move is ok (the dsb is white's bad bishop and the doubled f-pawns just help control the center), but i would have considered either bg5 or bd3 (why move the knight twice when the lsb is still waiting?) instead. in particular, bg5 makes the knight just look stupid. (…f6?! 8. bh4 g5? 9. nxg5!) !? at first, i didn't like this move. the kingside is weakened and 0-0 is now impossible. but, seeing as white plans to castle queenside and launch a pawn storm anyways, i now think that this move is fine, if very committal. ! knife's-edge timing. white castles at the very last moment before it would get dangerous not to, meaning that black has to wait until now before truly beginning a counter-attack. this feel for when to make "safe" moves and when to push it is absolutely essential if you want to play in an aggressive style, like white does in this game. ? the wrong pawn. just pushing pawns does not an attack make — you've got to try and open lines of attack (with pawn breaks, for example). …b5 would instead threaten …b4 to aim at the a-pawn and guarantee black a half-open file on the queenside. ! now, in contrast, white takes direct aim at the immobile target on h6, guaranteeing that things get opened up.  (note that …e5 is met adequately by ne4.) ? this move goes completely against the needs of the position. black cannot win by defending — sooner or later, white's attack will get through. black needs to use this time to counter-attack on the queenside. even if black can't mate first, s/he may be able to trade off/tie down some white pieces to defence to weaken white's attack. white wants blood and will not be denied! ?! interesting. black takes aim at white's center — if that was his/her plan, why wait until now? — which does blunt white's attack somewhat but also leaves some serious kingside weaknesses behind. my first impulse was to want to maintain the pawn on e5 (with qe2, say), but now i think white's attack is strong enough that this move is correct. black never has time to get things going in the center, and white's pawns are free to keep storming. other rook moves may be better — rg4 or rg2 come to mind — but this move is perfectly adequate. bh7+ is tempting but i would hate to part with such a lovely attacking piece. and now, the black king's cover is stripped away. this discovery has been available for many moves now, but it's never been a real threat. it still isn't. i wish there was a way to keep the rook on the h-file, but i don't see a good square for it where it isn't open to harassment from the bishops. maybe h4 — but then the pin on the g-pawn is unpleasant.  the f-file is the next best spot for the rook. this move is probably necessary, but i'd play hxg7! first, opening the h-file for more attacking, and wait to see what black does. now black's center is starting to look a bit menacing. ?! now, though, rh4 is definitely called for — it prepares for attack on the h-file (did you all catch that the h-file is important yet?), prevents …e4, and avoids further exchanges after …rf8. ? this move has nothing to do with the needs of the position. if black wants to move a queenside pawn, s/he should play …b5 and then …b4. otherwise, …bd5, preparing …e4, looks good to me. this is a good attacking move, and difficult to meet (…rf8? h7+!) but… when are you going to play hxg7!!!!!!??????? nice — this is a better move here than hxg7, by the way — now white is clearly better. what else? ?? nooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!  never close lines where you're trying to attack.  white should actually still win (an extra pawn makes up for a lot), so the question marks are not really deserved. still, with one move, white basically gives up any chance of attacking the black king for no reason at all. note that, after 33. qxe4, white couldn't /pay/ black to take on h6 — …gxh6 34. gxh6 qxh6 35. rg1+ is suicide. ? again, why close lines around the enemy king? qxd4 is a much nicer way to maintain a pawn advantage, since …kxh7 just exposes black's king. now, black does a great job exploiting the stalemating possibilities afforded him/her by white's own misguided pawns. ! instead of ducking for cover, the white king bravely ventures out to snatch pawns. why not? — there's no risk of mate. black's checks have only managed to lose 2 more pawns… but they have brought the position much closer to stalemate, which is the only escape left for black. i'm not sure what this move is trying to accomplish. instead, qd5 looks like a sure win — white will force a queen trade with qg8+, sacrificing a pawn to rule out stalemate, and then just push the queenside pawns. of course, to see that, you have to see the very real risk of stalemate, which is far from obvious. i'd like to think that i would see this in the heat of a real game, but i'm not sure i would. coyly inviting white to snatch the b-pawn — it's a threat, right? and now the draw is all but assured. well played to black. ! good, keeping a sliver of winning chances alive. with check, now! at least white now has qg8+ if black misses the stalemate. white can delay taking the pawn for longer, but black can force the issue with a few checks. aw, c'mon. …qb2+!! would have ended the game faster, and in much greater style. (ka4 qxb4+!) i assume that white saw the stalemate, but couldn't see a way out of the checks. good game to both players.

ıt look variation of (ruy lopez) spanish white attack allows to play white for rock and weak the black left side. the importance of these attack is middle control.i̇t looks black has advantage but it is not.two pawn of the middle is allow the set up a good game for white and also in future the black bishop also lock down in g7 after these game set up white is highly advantage because black knight pin and game play is getting weaker. after that move black position is very bad situation and knight not protected by pawn anymore. a6 pawn not protected because of knight c6. qxa6 is very dangerous for black defend side. this move is also bad for black because the defence of black already collapse. wrong move knigt a6 should be better. after that black defence side totally collapse.there is nothing to do. 
-------------------------------------
the most playable move all over the world. it is the best by test.  black answers symmetrically to challenge white's centre.  inaccuracy. best is 3..exd4. a mistake. again best is : 4...exd4 (or) 4… bg4 5. d5 nd4 6. be3 nxf3+ 7. gxf3 bd7 8. nc3 nf6 9. rg1 rg8 10. f4 exf4 11. bxf4 be7
-------------------------------------
 if 5...dxe5 6.qxd8+ nxd8 7.nxe5. (or 6...kxd8 7.bxf7.) 5...a6?? another mistake.  best is : 5… be6 6. bb5 bd7 7. bg5 f6 8. exf6 nxf6 9. o-o a6 10. bc4 h6 11. bxf6 qxf6 12. nc3 thought white has a clear advantage.
-------------------------------------
   6.bxf7!! this is white's best move. blunder 7… ke7 8. bg5+ nf6 9. exf6+ gxf6 10. qxc6 fxg5 11. qxa8 bg7 12. nc3 g4 13. nh4 bxc3+ 14. bxc3 kf7 15. qd5+ kg7 16. qd4+ qf6 17. o-o-o qxd4
-------------------------------------
king's gambit be3: the good thing is this move develops piece, clears the back for a possible queenside castle, and reinforces the center.  however, bxc6 is the better move.  (engine favors white with this move). this move is okay.  perhaps c6 would be a good alternative. this is a small inaccuracy in calculation. engine shows why: … c4 15. dxc4 nxb3 16. cxb3 qb6+ 17. rf2 rac8 18. nd5 nxd5 19. qxd5 rc7 20. cxb5 axb5 21. bg5 kh8 22. bxe7 rxe7. this gives white the extra pawn.  even kh8 is an improvement.  nothing wrong with this move, although something like cxb3 might be a better move.  by going na4 i protect the piece and also attack his queen (hoping for some momentum). the knight in such a location doesnt look too nice though.  a move like qd3 is slightly better because it develops my queen, defends the center, protects all the pieces, and the rooks are now free in the back. this was an error on my part.  i was hoping to get the pawn advantage. unfortunately 20. ...nxe4 21. bxe7 qxe7 gives the opponent a slight lead.  should have done nc3 to bring it back to action.  big mistake my me.  kg3+ being the danger which the opponent does in game. this is a mistake by the opponent.  the pawn on a5 is free to take. a4! would be a nice move. the purpose of this move is to start create a mating net. this move is too premature and white can still advance pawn to c6.  however, h5! is a much better move limiting the options for whites king to escape.   here i was too much in a hurry.  i was planning to promote while neglecting the defence of my king. engine says this is a blunder which gives black a checkmate in 7: 34. c7 h4 35. qg8+ kxg8 36. c8=q+ kg7 37. qb7+ rxb7 38. nc1 qxc1 39. c4 rb1 40. g3 rb2#  34. qc5 would still make this a game worth playing. opponent realizes the checkmate so i resign. 
-------------------------------------
the opponent chooses to continue with the quaade gambit. the agressive lolli gambit (wild muzio gambit) here the two best options are 5. 0-0 or 5. ne5. muzio gambit, paulsen variation between d3 and e5 i choose e5. two options are acceptable here. 8. bxf7+! (double muzio gambit) or  8. the less aggressive d3. (the engine prefers this move).  i choose the first. the databases favor qf5 over qxd4+ (although both are still just fine).  qxb2?  is a little too aggressive and ignores the pressure white is building up on the king side. the more defensive qg7 or even qf6 have better outcomes for black.  white attacks. nf6?  another mistake. qf6 would extend the game much longer. engine analysis suggests the following: … qf6 12. qxc7 qxf1+ 13. kxf1 nc6 14. qf4+ nf6 15. nc3 be7 16. nd5 rg8 17. nxe7 nxe7 18. bd4 ned5 19. qe5 re8 12. bd4!  attacks the queen and the knight. the final mistake by the opponent.  the reason is a checkmate in 3 moves … bc5 13. qxf6+ ke8 14. re1+ be7 15. qxe7# here i was a little hasty.  i missed the checkmate in 2. (14. re1+ be7 15. qxe7#). in game i realized i missed it and could still perform a checkmate (14. qf7+ kd8 15. qf6+ ke8 16. re8+ be7 17. qxe7#).  my opponent realizes this and resigns.  
-------------------------------------
ruy lopez instead of c3 i probably should have done ba2 to keep the bishop for a longer time. qc8?  i dont see a real significant reason why the opponent would do this move. engine suggests bc6. here i play be3 to develop the piece and reinforce the centre of the board. nonetheless i think 12. axb5 would be better. the move makes some sense trying to a)get rid of the bishop or b)drive it back. the engine claims this to be a mistake on blacks part: (… h6 19. bxf6 rb8 20. bxe7 rxb3 21. nxb3 bxe4 22. nbd2 bxf3 23. nxf3).  18. ... rb8 is the best move here.  chasing the white queen away. 19. qd1 would follow with rxb2 and 19. qa3 being the best place if such a position had arised. again rb8 is more aggressive. this move is a waste of time as has very little purpose at this moment. 20. c4! traps the opponents bishop at d3 and gains a few points. black should have avoided this and kept the bishop as it would be useful in the endgame (nxg5 is a fair trade for white).  a move like 23. ... bd8 would allow it to find a place on the other side of the board where it would be a bigger threat against white. again here black should have kept the bishop. instead do 27. ... kf7 and bring the king closer to action. white is already losing here and this move certainly doesn't help. rb6 would be a more clear and aggressive move. black has a rather large advantage at this point.  even the slightly better ke1 wouldn't help. 40. ... exd4+ 41. ke4 and white loses the rook and the game.

-------------------------------------
opto por la apertura italiana a pesar de su siciliana.  y por romper el centro rápidamente.  ahora necesito terminar de coordinar mis piezas para atacar el enroque negro.  no puedo perder el alfil de casillas blancas.  y el de casillas negras debe apuntar directamente al enroque negro.  mi rival sabe de la peligrosidad de mis dos alfiles. y yo también. ni me interesa perderlos ahora.  diagonal blanca b1-h7 abierta. he ganado espacio pero la torre del flanco de dama no está operativa. muevo el alfil de casillas negras para controlar la diagonal c1-h6 y para poder dar una salida a la torre del flanco de dama.  el rival contragolpea por el flanco de dama.  y yo por el del rey. mi peón central en d4 se antoja clave y hay que defenderlo. le da una salida al monarca. no me interesa que se abra la columna f. además su peón en f6 entorpece la acción de su alfil de casillas negras.  directo al punto débil.  si toma el caballo de h5 entro a saco con la dama en h7 dando mate. era fácil de ver. tengo que empezar a arriesgar aun a costa de dejar de defender el peón de d4.  el monarca negro huele el peligro y busca un lugar más seguro.  mi caballo ya no debe ser sacrificado y debe buscar un emplazamiento mejor para poder seguir atacando.  sacrifico el de h4 para abrir la columna g, dar jaque en g7 y doblar sus peones.  peón pasado. puede serle incómodo. amenaza de mate si el caballo de c6 se marcha. aprovechando la clavada.  no tenía otra opción.  limpio un poco el flanco de rey antes de retirar el alfil.  sigo explotando la clavada del peón de e6 y de paso ubico la torre en una posición más activa.  salvo mu peón.  da paso a su torre y saca el rey de la columna e presionada por la mía.  hay que despejar la zona.  y seguir atacando. estoy en desventaja y no puedo jugar pasivamente.  y de paso elimino al peón que capturóca mi caballo y que resultaba molesto. posibilidad de dar jaque si es preciso y de defender el enroque si es necesario.  no me interesa cambiar me interesa atacar.  su caballo en f3 sería letal y es ahora mi peón de g2 el que está clavado por la presión de su torre.  no puedo perder el alfil.  a ver si se puede tejer una red de mate. ¡ sí !

-------------------------------------
i was aiming for the center with my pawns. aiming for the h7-spot with my battery of queen and light-square bishop. o-o-o. long castling, my goal was a pawn storm against blacks castled king, because of that plan it was necessary for me to castle long. pretty good move. opens up the b1-h7 diagonal and also chasing away a defending piece from the king´s camp. looks like a meaningless check, but i had a plan with it. it seems at a first glance that black can win a pawn here. but he can´t, will then lose his queen. black is relocating his queen to a safer spot, away from the open and potentially dangerous d-file. now the e5-pawn must be more protected. chasing the knight away. i want to control the g-and h-files with my rooks after opening up. logic move from my perspective. that bishop became trapped. but if my assault against black´s king will have progress i can live with it. i got already three pawns for my bishop and has opened up the g-file against black`s king. probably a good exchange. i´m increasing the pressure against black´s king camp. no extremely hurry. black´s position are worsening for every move! and black´s f-rook is trapped. better to improve my position than take black´s rook. ??? not so good of black? the end is near... checkmate! 1-0. 
-------------------------------------
i hate, i hate openings... every time i see the first move, my mind says "oh non, pas celle-là, encore!!!" well, i have to review my petrov, because i lose more than i used to, when i played against "real people". oh, non! pas les trois cavaliers! and this is the first bizarre move i really do like. and i really like this position... for me, it is the best i can achieve when we are both castled king size: my rooks are close to be linked, f-column is my reign and my only weakness cannot be easily attacked. i only fear the possibility of d4, but i usually have time before it. well this is new to me ok, this is a terrible mistake, but we are not here to "analyze" it i made a mistake here. not to big, but though: my queen is overcharged of defense: h4, e6 and c7. i tryed to discharge... but why didn't i go back to f6? because i wanted not to lose tempo for my f-column, even at the cost of a pawn pawn lost? no, no... let's see the next moves. forced forced and this is a terrible situation, by the way. i hoped he would go away... but he really pleased me. thank you again: the h-pawn is definetely mine. could have saved it (temporarily) with 21. kg2 and 22. rh1. i guess in my mind it was: the piece you have has to be the one active. it took time to me to appreciate knights, but now i really do love them. that is a nice attempt to strike back by the way. all the credit to shammer not to resign. he found good ideas, according to me like this one not rc6 30. rb6 and i am in terrible mess... maybe taking directly 31. ... dxc was better. but i was preoccupied by the potential arriving of the second rook ok, take my e-pawn, i take your d-pawn as we said... last attempt to scare me, but it was pretty obvious, no? oh, no, another attempt, true... but this accelerate the end woups, threats mate in one! you cannot take my horse... and finally thanks for this last mistake... but i enjoyed the game for the nice bizarre situations... probably didn't deserve the annotation, but i liked it

-------------------------------------
dunst opening. an unusual opening move that develops a knight and pressures the central light squares. the reasons for its unpopularity are that it does not prevent black from occupying the center (unlike 1.nf3) and that it blocks white's c pawn from advancing. not a standard response to the dunst opening. the usual response is 1...d5, which occupies the center and threatens to attack white's knight if not blocked. the standard continuation of the dunst opening. white occupies the center, protected by her knight. attacks black's knight. black moves his knight out of harm's way. the knight now has an advanced foothold from which it can attack white's back rank in one move. pins black's knight to the queen. attack's white's bishop, forcing it to retreat. renews the attack on white's bishop while freeing black's knight from the pin. moves the bishop to safety while attacking black's unprotected e pawn. protects black's e pawn. ? black can now play 8...nxb5, which would force white to recapture with 9.nxb5, hanging her e pawn. however, black misses the opportunity and instead plays: ? blocks the check and attacks the checking bishop. ? again gives black the opportunity to take advantage of the situation by playing 9...nb5. ? recaptures the pawn and attacks white's bishop, forcing it to retreat. moves the bishop to safety. black attempts to box in white's bishop on g3. blocks black's h pawn from attacking white's bishop and attacks black's unprotected g pawn. moves the g pawn out of danger. attack's white's unprotected pawn. moves the pawn to a protected square. the pawn is now twice protected and twice attacked. this square, b5, becomes an important focal point and remains so for the entire duration of the game. attack's white's bishop. captures the knight. white can now recapture with 15.bxb5+. instead, white advances a pawn to attack b5 a second time. the knight is still within her grasp, though, as it is pinned to the king and cannot escape. black captures the pawn that was left en prise by this exchange. ? white again hesitates to capture the knight on b5, and this time her hesitation is more costly. her rook is now in a position to be forked. ! forks a queen, a rook, a bishop, and a pawn. ? white responds by moving her queen to a position where it can simultaneously avoid capture and protect the rook. however, this hangs her bishop at a4. a better response to the fork would have been the more aggressive 17.bxb5+, which would have forced black to defer the execution of his fork while he responded to the attack on his king. ? black falls into the trap that white has set. he should have captured white's unprotected bishop with 17...nxa4. instead, both of his knights are now en prise. white's queen recaptures. black has won the exchange but could have done much better. the b5 square is now attacked thrice. black finally moves to free his knight from the pin, which relieves the threat of check. white finally captures the knight at b5. after the dust clears, black has a material advantage of a rook and a pawn against a knight. black continues to bring his own forces to bear on the focal point at b5. the pawn there is now attacked twice and protected twice. attack's black's rook, but hangs the pawn at f4. moves rook to safety. protects the threatened f pawn and makes way for a castle. brings additional firepower to bear on the focal point at b5. protects the focal point at b5 a third time, but hangs the pawn at f4. captures the unprotected pawn but creates a doubled pawn structure for black. attacks white's knight and makes way for a castle. an aggressive response to the attack. blocks the check and renews the attack on white's knight. however, the attack cannot be executed, as black's bishop is now pinned to the king. protects white's knight and prevents black from castling. attacks white's bishop. ! white moves the bishop to the only safe location. although the bishop is unprotected, it cannot be captured because its attacker is pinned. frees black's bishop at e5 from the pin, which threatens white's bishop at d4. moves the queen to protect white's bishop while still protecting all the same pieces that it did previously. ! black notices that the white king's movement is constrained; if black's rook could make it to e8, the king would be in checkmate. black cannot execute this idea yet, but he positions his rook to take advantage of the situation should the opportunity arise—which it does. attacks white's queen. ?? this is the move that loses the game for white. black can now play 31...bxd4+, capturing white's bishop, checking the king, and opening the e file to present a serious threat of checkmate. white has no good response to this. a much better move would have been. 31.qd3. ! forks white's king and knight. white cannot respond with 32.rxd4 because black could then checkmate with 32...re1#. white is forced to move her king: ? white moves into a forced checkmate. 33.qb3 would have resulted in a queen exchange and made black's job harder. black sees the checkmate and takes it. the king is now immobile. (the e file is attacked by black's rook, the f2 square by black's pawn, and the g1 square by black's bishop.) all white can do now is ineffectually throw pieces in the queen's way.

linusinsulins vs coraldog minor piece development  philldors development  sort of loss of tempo there  standard attacking  run bishop  ah ? better was fxg3 for clear path or rook  pawn wall  queen evading  guarding b7 development completed  pawn chain of doom guarding. black has good defence but poor development of minors pinning the bishop white having more attacks, though a pawn down out of pin, but still... yum yum perfect combination  only move that doesn’t lose too much material  preparing  ???? i would rather lose a queen than be checkmated checkmate

tenedor, pues se puso asi , entonces me tocó aprovechar. en este momento el tiene sus piezas cerradas a excepcion de la reyna y los caballos que pueden saltar. yo tengo mis dos alfiles la reyna y los cballos listos, incluso uno de ellos desarrolado.  apoyando al peon y colocando a la torre en la linea abierta. sacrificando al peon pero manteniendo la linea abierta atacando al peon libre, y llevando mis piezas cerca del enroque contrario y el jugador se rindió.   muchas variantes a considerar pero podia salvarse. podria jugar por ejemplo: 15. ...be6 16.bxbe6 fxbe6 17.nxe6 y a donde mueva la torre lo siguiente es jaque y muere una de sus torres por el caballo, buen cambio teniendo un alfil de ventaja, en fin. el decidio retirarse.

ici je préfère avancer e5 pour menacer le cavalier, plutôt que de prendre tout de suite d5 avec la dame (que je pourrai de toute façon prendre plus tard). l'idée étant de me mettre en position d'attaquant pour rattraper le coup de retard noir. je continue la chasse ici je vois deux choix qui s'offrent à moi :  * changer de cible (notamment, prendre d5 avec la dame)  * faire l'échange c5-d4 je choisis de faire l'échange, pensant que le deuxième pion pourra être pris facilement je passe en position de chassé, ce qui ne me plait guère, mais j'ai l'avantage de pouvoir m'en sortir en prenant le pion, comme prévu ;) ici je préfère sortir le cavalier que le pion, afin d'amener un renfort éventuel par la suite voyant son rock je suis conforté dans ma position d'attaquant et non plus défenseur. je décide de tenter le mat avec dame en g2. première étape : libérer le terrain. il me faudra amener ma dame en d5 (couvert par le cavalier) et mon fou en b7 après avoir déplacé mon cavalier pour libérer la vue (impossible tant que le fou blanc b5 est là). je commence donc par chasser le fou. pensant jouer un bon coup en menaçant ma dame au lieu de fuir avec le fou, il m'aide en réalité puisque le cavalier ne couvre maintenant plus la position que je chérissais. je peux sauver ma dame en menaçant son fou : les deux pièces qui me dérangeaient seront parties. le deux tours précédents me permettent surtout de libérer la place pour le fou c8 vers c7. ils me permettent aussi à chaque tour de menacer son fou à cause de son mauvais placement, détournant l'attention de mon adversaire ! très mal joué ! il ignorait la prise en passant, or il m'offre avec ce coup de déplacer gratuitement le pion e4 qui gênait ma vue vers le mat, tout en menaçant son cavalier (et lui faisant perdre encore un tour). cela fait maintenant 4 tours que je me prépare sans qu'il ne puisse jouer ses propres coups. phase 1 : ok il aurait du le voir à ce moment là et avancer son pion en f3. il a sans doute cru que je préparais un rock. aveugle, il préfère menacer à nouveau ma dame. je recule pour protéger mon roi de l'échec par la dame en e4. accessoirement cela me mettra définitivement dans la position du mat. je croise très fort les doigts pour qu'il ne casse pas mes plans. il a maintenant trois moyens de le faire :  * avancer son fou en d5 (couvert par la dame)  * avancer son pion en f3 (couvert par le pion g2)  * ou encore couvrir g2 avec par exemple son cavalier en f4 dans ce cas j'ai prévu de rocker avant de réorganiser un autre assaut. difficile de croire qu'il n'a pas fait exprès de me l'offrir ;) un classique

ecco... a me non piacciono le partite di donna :( difesa slava... forse l'unica apertura di donna che conosco un minimo la variante di presa... poco usata... poco conosciuta... almeno un piccolo vantaggio per me :d in questi casi solitamente si preferisce giocare a4 per scardinare la struttura pedonale del nero. infatti se dopo a4 il nero giocasse a6, il bianco guadagna un pedone con axb5. il nero non può catturare col pedona a altrimenti perde la torre e se riprende col pedone c lo perde per via del cavallo. l'obiettivo era di creare una pressione sul pedone e4 un sacrificio forse non abbastanza supportato da altri pezzi forse sarebbe stato meglio rf8 propongo il cambio delle donne in virtù del leggero vantaggio materiale e per alleggerire la pressione lui ovviamente rifiuta :) poi però mi propone lui il cambio :o e ovviamente accetto metto le torri in collegamento cerco di migliorare la struttura pedonale  una semplificazione che forse mi fa comodo. rinuncia anche ad un pedone centrale per uno laterale... blocco il pedone d che altrimenti potrebbe crearmi dei problemi ormai il mio piano è chiaro: cambiare il più possibile per cercare di arrivare al finale con un vantaggio materiale cerco di semplificare ancora tentativo di guadagnare il cavallo ma ovviamente non ci casca svista clamorosa... non so perché dopo aver analizzato a lungo la posizione mi sono convinto che il pedone fosse indifeso! la partita torna in parità materiale e mi dico: "tanta fatica per nulla!!!" troppo complicato per me! :d cambio... e' il momento per il re di entrare in gioco poiché lui ha un pedone isolato, provo a cambiare gli alfieri per semplificare ancora un po' quel pedone impedisce l'avanzata del mio re e quindi preferisco cambiarlo rg4 non mi ispirava (h3+ rg3 h4 gxh4 txh4 e avrebbe poi potuto tagliarmi il re fuori dal gioco) decido di sacrificare un pedone per cercare di promuovere uno degli altri 2 credo la mossa decisiva: il pedone b sta per cadere lasciando via libera al pedone c un errore! si espone all'eventuale scacco nel caso decidessi di prendere il pedone b facendomi guadagnare un tempo! ma decido di fare altro... prendo l'opposizione attaccando il pedone "e" e difendendo il mio pedone g  scacco e il re è costretto a indietreggiare grazie al rf4 giocata in precedenza elimino il pedone e, forse l'ultimo pericolo rimasto. il pedone "g" a questo punto si può anche sacrificare mi ero già studiato la strada per mettere al sicuro il re: rc4 tg4+ rb3 tg3+ ra4 tg4+ ra5 e re in salvo ovviamente prendo il pedone a: se cambia le torri promuovo altrimenti se gioca tc4 per controllare il pedone c2 gioco tb1+ :) finisce qua. avrei giocato rxb2 ma anche c1=d+ andava bene per poi catturare la torre con la donna dopo lo scacco :)

dear english-speaking friends, sorry but once in a while you will be the ones who have the trouble of translating apertura caro-kahn variante sistema dei 2 cavalli alcune premesse: 1) sono scarso e pieno di lacune 2) sono solo un paio d'anni che mi dedico agli scacchi più seriamente cercando di studiare aperture, concetti. tatticismi, ecc. :) 3) amo il gioco aperto e molto offensivo  ceg5 è un po' velleitaria ma come detto tendo a giocare in modo molto spregiudicato! 1 alfiere per 2 pedoni e una struttura pedonale del nero indebolita... ne vale la pena? attacco la donna e il pedone g7 guadagno il terzo pedone con scacco impedendogli così di arroccare attacco l'afiere perché il cavallo non era difendibile questo credo sia un errore. forse avrebbe dovuto prima salvare l'alfiere (tanto il cavallo non poteva scappare) catturo l'alfiere + scacco spingendo il re all'aperto continua l'attacco al re sono stato a lungo indeciso se lasciare il cavallo per la torre o se difendere prima il cavallo ma temevo tg8 che mi avrebbe complicato la vita a questo punto ho un leggero vantaggio materiale e il re più al sicuro ma un pezzo in meno e praticamente tutti i pezzi da sviluppare! dg7: la casa forse più attiva e sicura per la donna ero indeciso se portare subito la torre sulla colonna aperta o se aprire la via all'alfiere. ho optato per la seconda per limitare le vie di fuga del re nero ho preferito attaccare il re invece che spostare la donna per limitare ulteriormente le vie di fuga del re: h5 o h3 quasi obbligata, de7 e df7 mi sembravano un po' fuori dal gioco proposta di cambiare le donne quasi scontata da parte sua ma soprattutto la forte minaccia di un matto spettacolare con df3 seguita da dg2# !! prendo la colonna aperta l'obiettivo era di portare l'alfiere in c3 in una casa molto più attiva attacco alla casa h2... se cattura in h2 c'è il matto con th4 ! difende il cavallo e attacca la torre, sicuramente una buona mossa attacco il cavallo... cattura il pedone ma calcola male... scacco... questa volta ha una via di fuga... cattura il pedone in g3 ma... perde il cavallo. forzo il cambio delle torri per cercare di capitalizzare il vantaggio materiale riprendo la colonna aperta qui ho sbagliato! pensavo che avrebbe catturato l'alfiere e invece... guadagna la torre per l'alfiere! entriamo in finale... ha un grande repertorio di finali... persi !! ma ultimamente ho iniziato a studiare qualcosa, soprattutto relativamente ai finali di pedoni...  l'opposizione è a sua favore! il mio piano è di attaccare i suoi pedoni con l'alfiere cercando di conquistare l'opposizione punto alla casa a5... se avesse giocato c4, avrei risposto con rc3 (44. c3 cxb3 45. axb3 c5 46. ab4+ d5 47. d3)  mossa di "attesa". il pedone b è bloccato, il pedone a non può avanzare (verrebbe catturato dall'alfiere), il pedone c non può avanzare (lo catturerei col pedone b)... conquisto spazio con il mio re! attacco il pedone c5! il re nero è costretto a indietreggiare! prendo l'opposizione e attacco il pedone a5 e lui si arrende :) 
-------------------------------------
yo jugue el gambito de manera normal (gambito de vienna), sin embargo el compañero en lugar de armar su defensa empezó a lanzarme sus peones de reina.  hasta ahi todo normal, sin ser muy ofensivo, aun podria rearmarse, jugando 9...ra7, 10.a4 bxa; por ejemplo no se da cuenta de la amenaza del avance del peón e5-e6 que libera la diagonal negra para mi alfil en f4 y ataca junto con el caballo de d5 al peón en c7. tendría que haber defendido ese peón (c7) manotazos de ahogado.  devastador ataque de caballos. no desarrollo sus fichas de manera correcta.  no habia salida 
-------------------------------------
todas sus jugadas son con los peones, excepto el alfil, todas sus piezas grandes están "no desarrolladas".  comienza el ataque por el centro avanzo peón bien respaldado por dos piezas y dos peones. trato de llegar a su rey que está expuesto sigue avanzando sus peones, debilitando su posición con ésta jugada ataco al rey con la tore, ya que el peón de rey de los negros tiene poca protección. ataque del negro, sin tener resguardado a su rey continúa con su ataque ahora a mi enroque capturo el peón que quedó sin protección. error terrible porque mi alfil negro no tenía protección, gané peón pero perdí el alfil segundo error, ese peón no podía defender al alfil por estar "clavado" por la torre. empieza el ataque al rey.  aquí a pesar de no tener muchas piezas en el ataque, sin embargo  tenía dos peones pasados, uno de los cuales me puede ayudar en un ataque directo al rey. incluso para hacer jaque al rey y ganar su  torre. con el caballo. con esto obligo a que se mueva el rey y luego al comer con el  peón (al alfil) queden en jaque rey y reina (tenedor)   tenedor a rey y reina. rey expuesto, es hora de sacar a la reyna como caballo o torre cerrándole las salidas ataque a la reina aqui, la mejor continuación sería: 31...rxnb6 32 qxr+ kc8 33.d6  la misma torre le cerró las salidas a su rey. 
-------------------------------------
me parece que hay un error en esta jugada ya que tiene sus piezas guardadas y en lugar de desarrollarlas trata mas bien de sacar sus peones. además éste peón f7 es el más débil y al sacarlo abre la posición que ocupaba ese peón. permitiendo un ataque en esa zona. debió desarrollar sus piezas como ...ng8   o ...bg4 yo ya tengo todas mis piezas desarrolladas y él sólo al alfil blanco y la reina, libres. y además me ha dejado la línea central libre para dominarla con la torre de rey. y ataca sin haberse defendido primero. y pierde su única pieza desarrollada. avanza un peón que no tiene absolutamente ninguna defensa ???? atacando la diagonal abierta abierta, preparando un posible ataque coordinado con la reina en h5 sigo insistiendo ya que su alfil esta "clavado". podría haber jugado torre a1-d1; pero perdía la iniciativa. se escabulle podria haber jugado también 17. rd1+ ganando la dama, pero perdía iniciativa. teniendo la torre cubriendo la retirada el rey queda expuesto y llega la estocada final mate! 
-------------------------------------
no se dio cuenta de que mi torre podia causar daño estando alli fatal, tenia que haber salvado su torre hace rato hasta ahie stabamos empates pero mi torre estaba libre en su campo si perdia el peon g4 perdia la partida. tenia que haber capturado el peon, alli perdió. mejor: ...bg4! hubiera sido mejor que capture al peon g6 en lugar de la torre, y luchando tranquilamente podría aún ganar. pero hubiera sido muy dificil caballo contra torre. y un solo peon de ventaja.

alguien dijo que e4 y blancas ganan lucha de peones acepto la pelea y devoro su peon, para ver que jugada realiza captura el peon echamos a la reina pierde varios movimientos y ha liberado solo a la reina y al alfil blanco, yo tengo libres a mi caballo reina y alfil blanco ataque al caballo. parece que el jugador solamente quería atacar y atacar sin preparar su defensa,  yo me sigo desarrollando porque mi caballo esta defendido esa jugada no la entiendo saco el alfil y defensa adicional para el caballo, preparo 00 tampoco entiendo esa jugada 00 al parecer piensa que enviando peones puede causar daño pero los manda avanzando un lugar a la vez. echamos al alfil o esperamos el intercambio el decidio intercambiar, quiere seguir atacando como su alfil aqui avanzo su peon para evitar que entre con mi alfil a b7 protejo mi caballo, no quiero perderlo ataque con la reina a un lugar en el que no causa daño, aunque está directamente encaminado a mi rey. sigue sin desarrollar sus demás piezas ataco con torre a la columna del rey protege su peon debil pero su rey sigue en la mira fuera! saca su reina a una posición que le parece buena empiezo a llenar el centro mi peon avanzado tiene 3 defensas el piensa que voy a tomar su peon de rey pero me conviene mas seguir avanzando porque mi peon aun esta defendido ya que cubrio a su reina con el alfil sigue teniendo 3 defensas aqui me desconcertó porque el jugador parecía querer atacar siempre. fue una buena jugada porque detiene el avance de mi peon, aunque mi peon sigue estando en su territorio y muy bien resguardado. prepara avance de caballo y amplio el movimiento de mi reina a los dos flancos ataque al peon aqui pongo mi caballo en ataque a su alfil porque cubria al peon c5 y me tapaba la linea de ataque al rey negro mueve el alfil atrás para que no lo coma, pero deja a mi peón en posición de realizar un ataque "tenedor" entre su caballo y alfil dejándome ganar un alfil si avanzaba mi peón a d6 ganaba el alfil pero mi caballo quedaba clavado, y no quería intercambiar mi reina. así que tomé el peón sin defensa que tanto me molestaba. con eso su cetro quedó muy débil y su rey expuesto saco la reina para evitar que la comiera tenedor a caballo y alfil. avanza peon pensando que iba a retroceder mi caballo y quizas realizar un intercambio de caballo por caballo introduje mi caballo estando protegido por mi alfil penso salvar su alfil comí caballo y libere mi reina que iba hacia la captura del rey negro. tenia que capturar mi peón de e7 porque sino le comería el alfil y coronaba con dos reinas ganando por mate o ganancia de material. captura el peón !!! excelente jugada pues obligo a comer al caballo con ese alfil que defendía a su rey, era necesario que comiera el caballo o sino comía su reina  captura del alfil, el unico defensor del rey capturado ???con esta jugada defiende a la torre de a7 pero no se da cuenta de la amenaza del alfil blanco, tenia que haber jugado g7! unica,  unica mate. 
-------------------------------------
esperaba defensa siciliana por la salida del peon debil, y seguramente luego el caballo. decidí desarrollarme por ese lado con el caballo efectivamente sacó el caballo saco el peón del rey que ya está defendido por el caballo y preparo la liberación de mis piezas mayores parece repetir mis movimientos yo continúo desarrollando mis piezas apoya sus peones pero sigue sin desarrollar sus piezas. al parecer le gusta jugar más con los peones agrandando su "cancha", como en un campo de fútbol aseguro que no entre el caballo en b5 y preparo mi enroque del lado del rey jugada bastante ofensiva, a parte prepara al parecer el enroque de rey sigo liberando mis piezas, en este caso el alfil de rey para poder realizar el enroque penetra en mi zona del tablero con el caballo, teniendo mi caballo de reina clavado por el alfil largo decide comer en lugar de irse, con lo cual pierde el alfil que es la defensa del enroque de rey desarrolla su reina ataco su reina y preparo un ataque "tenedor" entre el rey y la torre, supuse que él retrocedería su reina para salvar su torre pero no se dio cuenta del tenedor. quiso ser ofensivo pero se equivocó jaque al rey y a la torre del rey el rey se acerca a "atacarme",  tomo la torre empieza a sacar sus piezas para capturar el caballo con la torre de reina, yo tenía como prioridad preparar mi enroque. libero la zona para poder enrocar sigue sacando sus piezas para comerse a mi caballo.  aprovecho para eliminar la amenaza del caballo suyo antes de enrocar protejo al peón solitario y dejo a la reina libre para salir por los dos lados 000 protege su rey preparo salida de la torre de rey por g ese error no lo vi, lo confieso. no me di cuenta de que ponía su reina al lado de mi peón prácticamente sacrificándola. sölo me preocupé por mi peón sin darme cuenta de que su reina estaba a mi merced.  ????, tenía que haber capturado la reina ??? tenia que haber movido su reina la capturé. su error fue grosero ya la partida estaba perdida salvar mi torre el último error, atacó a mi reina, que estaba el linea con el rey, pero no se dio cuenta de que su alfil no tenía ninguna protección. perdió la partida.  
-------------------------------------
peón de rey a e4 defensa clásica a e4 gambito de rey, se plantean muchas variantes que  aún no han sido develadas del todo. el alfil, aprovecha de inmediato la debilidad de la  diagonal b7-g1 previniendo la salida de la dama negra en h4+ y atacando e5 gambito aceptado, sacrificio aceptado. ahora tengo la iniciativa atacando de inmediato f7, amedrentando un poco al rival. le ha ganado el miedo de una celada, o trampa táctica y ha movido su dama. no puede tomar dxe4 por te1!, ganando dama jugada fuerte sin embargo a partir de aquí me aventuro 
-------------------------------------
 en una combinación que me dará la victoria, luego de... impresionante sacrificio de caballo por dos peones  y la columna semiabierta de f obligada una posición casi ideal. obviamente se plantean fuertes
-------------------------------------
 amenazas después de esto. no vale df6 por ae5. amenazando capturar el  peón de f6 y la torre de h8 para prevenir la captura de d4, evidentemente un error de las negras, lógico sería un desarrollo de piezas
-------------------------------------
 seguido de peones para buscar contrajuego.  despúes de b4, sigue axb4, cxb4 y dxd4+, dando un poco de aire al bando negro. preferí esto a 11. dh5, cf6. las negras consiguen un poco
-------------------------------------
 de contrajuego. las negras planean un curioso mate en g2 previniendo ese mate y para doblar torres otro error, que aprovecho en seguida clavando caballo las negras me ofrecen su caballo, a cambio de su enroque. atacando cd2 ofreciéndole el caballo, pero amenazando mate en g3 cuarto error garrapafal. amenazando mate en f7, también 18. ag5+ capturando 
-------------------------------------
apertura de peón de rey planteando defensa francesa cerrando el centro defensa francesa, variante del avance un error, las blancas debieron mantener  la estructura central de peones castigando de inmediato el peón aislado las blancas buscan contrajuego finalmente decido comer para atormentar al peón de e5 otro error, me cambia su única pieza activa. mis peones centrales están más fuertes ahora. atacando e5 de inmediato y retomando la iniciativa. la única las blancas me entregan la diagonal de b7-g1 forzada ganando pieza menor otro error, ya no he ganado pieza menor, sino mayor. para enviar el alfil al ataque continuo mi desarrollo única si deseo seguir el ataque error, el rey tapa sus propias piezas para salir de nueva cuenta, se castiga la impericia del rival. única jugada del blanco que vale la pena, después de cualquier jugada negra sigue  ae3, ganando dama o buscando un poco de  contrajuego retomando la iniciativa y el ataque las blancas están perdidas, luego de a4 y las blancas se rinden. 
-------------------------------------
nice small game, although clearly decided by blunders... night put in a nice position, but the development of black pawns is threatened, and so is the black centre...  τοποθετεί το  άλογο σε ισχυρό τετράγωνο, αλλά απειλείται η δομή των πιονιών του μάυρου, και ο έλεγχος του κέντρου... tries to gain more control over the centre....   τείνει να ισχυροποιήσει τον έλεγχο των μαύρων στο κέντρο, είναι όμως ακόμα ρευστό... white hoped to simplify the centre and get more space, but this plan failed and white knight loses its nice position...   προσπάθεια διάσπασης του κέντρου, όμως σταθεροποίηση του, και ο λευκός ίππος δεν έχει καλή τοποθέτηση ! really strong move by the black,threatens bxa3 and dxc4... white didn't notice, but it appears that neither black did...  ! δεν πρόσεξα την απειλή αχ α3, αλλά προφανώς ούτε κι ο μαύρος, με αποτέλεσμα να χάσει ένα πιόνι...   ??? black still didn't notice the bxa3...  ο μαύρος έχει ακόμα την ευκαιρία να κερδίσει υλικό με αχ α3, αλλά πάλι δεν το προσέχει. η κατάσταση στο κέντρο απλοπιείται protects c2, and the knight gets in a strong position, thretening the queen and the pawn on e5  προστατεύει το γ2, σε ισχυρή θέση ο ίππος, απειλή τη βασίλισσα στο β6 και το πιόνι στο ε5, πιέζει το κέντρο ?????? black didn't see his queen threatened, which will cost him the game...   ?????? ο μάυρος δεν βλέπει την άμεση απειλή κατά της βασίλισσας... αβλεψία που θα του κοστίσει το παιχνίδι... white starts his attack now that his king is not threatened, while black king is open to dangers  ο λευκός θα περάσει στην επίθεση στην πτέρυγα του βασιλιά, ενώ ο μαύρος βασιλιάς είναι ανοιχτός (η προώθηση των πιονιών μειώνει ταυτόχρονα την αξία του μαύρου ροκέ, αν και εκθέτει κάπως και τον λευκό βασιλιά (ο λευκός δεν ανυσηχεί τώρα που λείπει η μαύρη βασίλισσα) the attack goes on but slowly, the black 0-0 is threatened by the pawns advance... also he didn't notice the pawn at h5, which puts the black king in danger...   η επίθεση των λευκών εξελίσσεται, και ο μαύρος τελικά κάνει ροκέ, πολύ αποδυναμωμένο όμως.... ταυτόχρονα παραβλέπει το πιόνι στο θ5, με αποτέλεσμα περαιτέρω κινδύνους για τον μαύρο βασιλιά... desperate tries from of the black to create some attacking games...  ο μαύρος προσπαθεί απεγνωσμένα να δημιουργήσει επίθετικές δραστηριότητες κατά του λευκού ροκέ, είναι όμως αποτυχημένες... ??? seems that the black didn't really search this move, he just sacrifices his bishop...   ??? περαιτέρω άσκοπη θυσία, προφανώς δε μέτρησε καλά ο μαύρος, το τέλος πλησιάζει... and black resigned, since he has no more chances for a game...   και ο μαύρος εγκατέλειψε, καθώς και μετά από αυτή την άσκοπη θυσία δεν έχει καμία δυνατότητα δημιουργίας παιχνιδιού... 
-------------------------------------
 la emboscada se aproxima... i think it was better bxc3. the white doesn´t realize what i have prepared.
-------------------------------------
 ataque a la dama y en retirada, al rey to late for df2. the queen didn´t have to capture the a7 pawn!. now the white has no defense.
-------------------------------------
 ahora se ve porque anteriormente esta era mejor y no haber comido el peon a7. el blanco da todas las facilidades para ir por el rey... there isn´t much to do.
-------------------------------------
i'm not much of an e5 player, but i chose to play it because i was hoping for a real morphy king's gambit game. danish gambit, i rather like white's chances after the two pawn sacrifice so i'll decline. i debated between the sörensen defense immediately (d5), but i decided to see my opponents reaction to qe7. an attempt to solve the e4 pawn, but instead later it allows me access for a decent post in his territory. the whole time i was expecting a cxd4...poor b1 knight never got to participate much preventing the imminent castle at least for the moment i'm still unsure of this move, perhaps just for a development and for a battery? destroying hte battery and launching a counter offensive i particulary like this move.  development support to the knight; frees the queen more support to the knight and also an indirect attack to the queen. i figured i had decent position and i was welcome to the trade; however, my opponent fell for the trap.... gobbling the a7 pawn and... losing the knight. rxe2 and qc1  support to the bishop and also attacking the b2 pawn here i looked into the position a little bit deeper and decided this was still in my best interest even after my queen will be traded out or i lose my bishop entirely i was rather surprised at this move, i assumed he'd take the queen, but instead he tried to launch an attack at my weak base. there was no immediate checkmates and i figured he could chase me around and i could end to safety at g6 if needed threatens mate with rb8 another pawn gobbled everything seems well protected and no chances for me losing yet, so back to my offensive i guess my opponent decided we were in a sort of drawish position and figured he could push his a pawn without resistance perhaps i could've made another move, but at the time i didn't account for qb2 which halts my attack there's the qb2...i get an extra pawn and let the trade occur tough position, perhaps better to not have traded rooks, but still i should be able to take the game with relative ease he too decides it's too hard to continue.  
-------------------------------------
ouverture classique. réponse classique. rien à dire... cherche le jeu ouvert... aggressif? je continue mon chemin tranquillement. huh !? pion gratuit? j'ai un doute, mais bon tant pis j'attaque!  1. prévisible... retrait préventif... il mijote quelque chose... mais j'ai toujours trouvé que d'échanger mon cheval pour un fou étais à mon avantage dans la majorité des cas. ok. tout va bien. tiens donc, il a reprit le pion. on va le forcer à bouger pendant que je déploi mes pièces. pas mauvais. moi aussi j'en une! un embouteillage se forme... je vais essayer de doubler le rangée e. il a vu venir le coup... je doit faire attention... c'est un petit malin. aller le fou tire toi! c'est bien ca... maintenant faut que je mette de la pression sur ca reine pour atteindre son cheval. très bon, en plus il doit couvrir c7 pour ne pas perdre sa tour. attention à la tour en e8 qui pourrait menacer ma reine. bon c'est fait pour le cheval. bon coup, mais c'est maintenant qu'on va voir si tu joues bien... je libère ma reine. je pense qu'il va essayer de mettre de la pression avec son pion en f5... excellent!!! ah ha! et la beauté ici c'est le cheval qui peu mettre aussi échec (double échec). et voilà la déscente aux enfers. et hop sacrifice du cheval... pourquoi? il faut regarder le fou e4 - b7... hehe  ah surprennant, mais j'avais aussi envisagé... il pense peut-être que je ne suis pas du type à échanger les reines... pouah! tiens toé! dans les dents, et je suis pas sur qu'il voit ce qui va lui arriver. pas vraiment le choix, hein? il pense toujours pouvoir mettre de la pression sur mon fou...  merci pour la jolie tou-tour...  et tous ca pour... ca!!! rien à faire tu as perdu... ah ben oui il résign.
-------------------------------------
 bravo à moi! 
-------------------------------------
vediamo che succede aumentando la pressione su h3... io non avrei avuto tutta questa fretta di cambiare! il bianco non si è accorto di avere la torre in e1 non protetta sinceramente questa è stata una mossa che mi ha colto proprio di sorpresa! menomale che riuscivo ad avere come prima una buona forza sulla torre in e1 con questa mossa mi sono messo un po' più tranquillo forse era meglio accettare lo scambio... bianco molto caparbio! era forse più antipatica c4 difficile uscire da quasta situazione per il bianco...  
-------------------------------------
 ok, anyway, he has now moved his pawn up to d3. this provides further support to his pawn on e4 that my bishop was attacking. it also allows his black bishop to come out and develop/attack if he wants i'm now building a safe area to castle into. if i choose to castle that side my king will be well protected...  apparently it's important to castle in the first 12 moves. i'd like to disagree with this statement but i've lost track of the number of games i've messed up through not castling early enough still no pieces taken and there are no obvious signs that things will change in the next few moves hopefully volhouder will forget his house keys like my dad. that way he might time out.  i love it when your opponents times out. you win the game without even having to think or nothing. remember kids… it’s the winning that really matters, not the taking part. no one likes a loser
-------------------------------------
blackburne gambit!! ... non accettato... :-( perché questa mossa? comincia l'incursione di donna e cavallo! !! con questo il bianco ha neutralizzato tutti i miei attacchi... forse un po' naive? questa mossa sfocia nel massacro. forse era meglio ...qg4! ! i lancieri neri chiudono cavalleria e arcieri tra le proprie sarisse e i ranghi della loro stessa fanteria!! trappola psicologica, non tutti si ricordano l'en passant... beerheit invece se ne ricordava...

bishop's opening (c23) det näst vanligaste svaret i gameknots databas, efter 2.nf3. är ovan vid denna öppning, så jag övervägde instinktivt att gå ut med s enligt öppningsprinciperna. det vanligaste svaret i bishop's opening (c24), berlin defence. det fjärde alternativet i gameknot world book. här övervägde jag först att slå nxe4 (till svarts fördel i databasen), men p g a orutin med bishops ö  valde jag det lugnare och vanligaste nc6.  nr 1: 3.d3 bishop's opening (c24), berlin defence det vanligaste svaret i denna öppning. lätt fördel vit. det 5:e alternativet i bishop's opening (c24), berlin defence. till svarts fördel.  nr 1: 4. d3 (till vits fördel med råge) det vanligaste svaret, med 40-30 % till vits fördel. ett tokdrag som skenbart ser offensivt ut, men som ger -2,55 i analys. svart kompenserar lätt den förstörda rockaden med det tidiga materialövertaget. det enda rimliga, och analys ger -2,46. vit attackerar planlöst, och förlorar tempo genom att inte utveckla övriga pjäser. här anar jag vits avsikt att komma ut med d till b3 med sikte mot g8. min spontana tanke är därför ta kommandot över center med d5, vilket också är analysens 1:a drag. -2,99. eftersom jag vill bevaka h5 mot vits d med min s, så väljer jag att slå qxd5; vilket också är analysens 1:a drag -3,53 vit förlorar ännu mer tempo, och skapar inget produktivt; vilket ger mig -4,68 vid analys. utvecklar min l med initiativ och press mot vits s och d. bättre hade varit 10.h3 -4,58 bäst hade varit 10...e4 och därnäst 10...be7; nu försätter jag min mörka l i ett trängt läge. plötsligt inser jag att min e-bonde står i vägen för effektiva manövrar med d, och min l på b6 ser ut att bli inträngd när som helst. lika så bra att gå upp till e4, och det är också analysens bästa förslag. -7,52 flyttar fram positionerna och ger manöverutrymme längs 5:e raden. trängt läge och min mörka löpare känns rökt, men mitt positionella övertag är så stort i övrigt att jag anser mig ha råd med ett tokdrag. -13,41 innan tokdraget. nu har jag "endast" -2,75 i övertag och det räcker långt. vits bästa respons i det här läget. bäst hade varit 13...qh5, och t o m ett avancemang till d3 hade varit bättre än denna onödiga reträtt. förlorar initiativ och tempo och min s behöver inte skyddas genom denna manöver. analys sänker mitt övertag till -0,82. tur i oturen att vit missar initiativet med b5, så nu återfår jag det positionella övertaget. -3,28. analysen anser vits motdrag vara ett grovt misstag och ger svart en ställning på  -9,32. bättre hade varit 15. bb2. men jag krånglar också till läget i onödan, och missar den uppenbara 15...nd4 med schackpotential senare på f3 och materialvinst. ett grovt misstag mot en starkare motståndare, och den här positionella missen får inte upprepas. när vit aktiverar sin l till bb2 har vit ett övertag på +2,20. som sagt...går till f4 med d för att minska skadeverkningen. nu är det bara för vit att knipa min l på g4 och vinna partit...eller ? åååh, vit missar det initiativet och jag får tacka och ta emot. men jag glömmer ändå att omgruppera min l fast med ett tagande av d-filen som kompensation. analysen ger mig inget beröm för detta drag +2,44 och min l står där fortfarande och väntar på nådastöten... men den kom inte nu heller, och nu är jag äntligen medveten om min ljusa löpares livsdugkighet; så jag räddar den till h3. -4,72 mitt övertag är återställt och jag kan börja planera en slutattack. bättre hade varit 19. rd1 med försvar av den efterblivne d2. övertaget är så stort att även detta initiativ funkar, även om analysen föredragit rxd2. funkar, men är långt ifrån optimalt då vit kan jag min dam med 21.rg1 det här draget skulle som sagt ha gjorts innan g1 blev tillgänglig för vits bakre torn. vit ger ett desperat intryck, och offrar sin l planlöst. -8,93 bäst hade varit att straffa vits l med gxf3 direkt, men på den här nivån är chanser till matt värda att försöka. vit går i fällan... så ska en slipsten dragas. 
-------------------------------------

-------------------------------------
el enroque es perfectamente válido, pero prefiero mantener bajo control el centro otra opción es ab3, pero como dije antes tenia en mente tanto el control del centro como un posible ataque al flanco de rey ganando espacio! correcto, las negras no dejan que me consolide en el centro e inmediatamente lo atacan mala jugada! yo esperaba ch5 a lo que pensaba jugar ae3 y el peón de d5 me debe de dar una ligera ventaja ganando tiempo para poner las torres en el centro en realidad las blancas solo deben de tener una ligerísima ventaja ya que las negras ocuparán tambien el centro con sus torres, pero con esta centralización pretendo además hacer "rayos x" a la casilla h8 así como tener bajo control a un defensor del enroque negro esta jugada es horrorosa! y todo a pesar de que es una partida por "correspondencia" a traves de internet, está claro que mi rival es un jugador bastante ético y no utilizó ningún programa informático, y yo tampoco! os lo prometo! jugada ganadora, las negras aceptaron el "regalo griego" y perdieron inmediatamente, pero de todos modos el control de la casilla f6 hace que gane con mi penetración de dama en h6  
-------------------------------------
e4 is my favorite opening in hopes of the italian game where many fun traps await. and it seems to be a favorite of blacks too. giuoco pianissimo, canal variation white is unconcerned about the doubling on the c file since it would still add support to the center, but offers the chance to double the e file and open the f file for later use as well! an unsound choice at best, that proves unfavorable for white later on. preparing to double the rooks on the f file for a kingside attack. white gets distracted from the original plan of kingside attack. returning to the plan at hand white's feeling the pressure of the queenside attack consuming the center and is getting desperate with no real way to open up the kingside underfire. 25.rf3! "if i win, it was a sacrifice. if i lose, then it was a mistake." – george koltanowski aimming for a way to open the kingside up black doesn't see the threat.. ...of opening up the base to invasion... ...of the perpetual check! a last minute save for white's weak doubled pawn opening. 1/2-1/2

el movimiento c4 que puede dar  lugar a una apertura inglesa o a muchas otras, lo que evidentemente depende en cierta forma de las negras. en mi caso, suele suceder que refleja una apertura sin pretensiones específicas, algo así como ya veremos que pasa...  este movimiento me resulta incomprensible en conjunción con e6. ¿es síntoma de desorientación o simplemente de falta de conocimiento de transposición de aperturas?  no se emocionen, difícilmente volveré a jugar esto.  alternative variation: [una oportunidad que dejan pasar las negras es] 4... d4 5. exd4 nxd4 6. bb2 bc5 7. na3 ne7 8. nc2 nec6 9. nfxd4 nxd4 10. b4 nxc2+ 11. qxc2 bd4 12. be2 [me parece que era un hallazgo bastante concreto que igualaba posibilidades en la apertura derivado del movimiento b3.]  queda claro que la estrategia blanca no tiene pretensiones específicas. algunas veces esta forma de desarrollo me ha ofrecido buenos resultados, incluso contra jugadores teóricamente más fuertes en los que el combate se traslada al medios juego, y algunos se dejan llevar por la ilusión de que el blanco no atacará nunca...  alternative variation: 10. a3 dxc4 (10... bxc4 11. dxc4 a5 12. qc2) 11. dxc4 b4 12. axb4 (12. a4 nd7 )  alternative variation: 12... rb6   alternative variation: 14... ne7  15. bd3 f5 16. b4   cambio de plan...apuntalando e5. alternative variation: 18. nb3 [era consecuente con el planteamiento pero imprecisa y era mi idea original. la molestia por no jugarla se derivaba de recordar aquel famoso juego que karpov le ganó a yusupov en una española abierta, donde las blancas dominaron el juego evitando en todo momento el movimiento liberador c5.]  alternative variation: 19. exf6 bxf6 20. ne5  alternative variation: 20... bxc5  con los dos últimos movimientos las blancas pretendíeron consolidar la estructura de sus peones antes de buscar una ventaje definitiva en el flanco de dama. no parece ser malo, pero sin duda es una idea menos concreta que el movimiento recomendado por la máquina. alternative variation: 23. rfc1   alternative variation: 25... bxa4 [necesario para evitar el peón pasado que da forma a una ventaja definitiva..]  el movimiento del caballo lo realicé porque resolví que me daba ventaja inmediata de material. sin embargo, el ir y venir del caballo es poco preciso y retarda la ejecución de la ventaja. era más apropiado mover la torre a la segunda fila. alternative variation: 27. ra2 [claro! la apertura de líneas podrías crear dificultades adicionales a las negras en virtud de que parece ser más armoniosa la posición de las torres blancas.]  demasiada precaución. alternative variation: 29. nxf7 gxh2+ 30. kh1 bxf7 31. rf2 bh5 32. be2 [esta fue la jugada que no me vino a la cabeza]

-------------------------------------
comienzo con e5 poniendo un peon en el centro. desarrollo mi caballo en c6, protejo mi peon de e5 y ataco el centro. mi rival quiere crear complicaciones en el centro rápidamente. tomo para abrir el centro cambio caballos y la apertura se torna irregular. mi rival me sorprende en este movimiento. creí que tomaría con el peón de e. sin perder tiempo pongo mi peón de d en el centro. jugada razonable desarrollando el caballo y atacando el peón central. defiendo mi peon central y desarrollo el caballo. jugada de concepto. empiezo a preparar un posible enroque corto. el blanco aca avisa que pretende sacar su alfil rey por el fianchetto, la idea es poner mas presión sobre el peón de d5. personalmente la jugada me pareció mala. creo que el alfil blanco tiene mejor juego en e2 o en d3. c6 es la mejor jugada en este momento. por un lado apoyo a mi peon de d5 y por otro evito el salto de caballo a b5 que posteriormente ganaría el peón de a7. esta jugada me tomó unos minutos pensarla. la idea aca es hacerle caso a capablanca cuando decía que hay que simplificar la posición. tomo el peon negro al mismo tiempo que le ofrezco cambio de damas.  blanco acepta el cambio. con esta jugada pierdo el enroque, pero enroques sin damas muchas veces no tienen sentido. ag5 clavando mi caballo. apoyo mi caballo y resuelvo la clavada. esta es la jugada en donde el blanco pierde la partida. cxe4 entrega un caballo con nada ya que la clavada está resuelta. aca creo que al blanco lo traicionaron los nervios del torneo. a esta altura estoy con pieza de más. el blanco que ya debió haber abandonado decide seguir y atacar mi caballo con su alfil presionando también sobre h7. cc5 buena. retirando el caballo y atacando al alfil. enroque largo aceptando el cambio de piezas para poner una torre en juego. esta jugada la pensé un rato y jugadas más tarde me arrepentí. lo correcto según la teoría de capablanca hubiese sido td8 ofreciendo el cambio de torres para seguir simplificando la posición y si el blanco no acepta el cambio yo ganaba la columna abierta d. pero no, mi idea era un poco diferente. mi plan era conseguir un enroque forzado, llevando en un futuro mi rey a f8 y ganando la columna e con la torre y hacer los cambios de torre sobre esa columna. veamos como sigue la partida. evidentemente el blanco da jaque con la torre en e1. aca habían 2 opciones: retirar el rey a f8 y cambiar las torres, lo que no me hace ganar la columna e que es lo que quiero lograr, o bien jugar ae6 cubriendo el jaque y presionando sobre el peón desprotegido de a2. me decanté por esta última ya que es más agresiva y va más con mi estilo de juego. las blancas comienzan un ataque por el flanco con f4.  sigo con mi plan retirando el rey a f8. blanco dobla sus torres. y este error podría haberme costado caro. si el blanco hubiese seguido con b3, mi alfil queda encerrado y sería muy dificil de salvar. afortunadamente la moral de mi rival estaba ya por el suelo y no vio la celada. el blanco se tira al cambio de torres. aca me asusté un poco. mi razonamiento fue este: el blanco vio mi error en a2 y ahora esta tratando de simplificar la posición para después jugar b3, ganar mi alfil y tratar de igualar la posición. viendo como estaba el panorama me dije: "bueno, seguramente esto termina en tablas". se cambian las torres y se simplifica la posición. si mi alfil cae, el final será muy complicado y hay mucha posibilidad de tablas. grande fue mi sorpresa al ver esta jugada. el blanco no ve la celada y juega c3 convirtiendo mi error de axa2 en una buena jugada. la partida aca esta ganada. mi alfil toma una muy buena ubicación en b3. comienza la carrera de los reyes por el control del centro, fundamental en el final. comienzo a preparar mi ataque definitivo por el flanco. esta jugada pierde un tiempo, hubiese sido mejor seguir con el ataque de peones. continua mi ataque. ruptura en c3 el blanco esta tarde con los tiempos e intenta apurarse. gano un tiempo con el alfil retirandolo de b3 al mismo tiempo que jaqueo al rey. sigue mi ataque. era mejor g6 trato de inmovilizar al blanco. blanco juega mal y se queda sin ataque en el flanco. una preocupación menos para mi.  aca la clave esta en ganar espacio con el rey. si nos fijamos, hay una barrera formada por el peon, el alfil y el rey. el rey blanco no se puede acercar. mi rey sigue ganando todo el espacio posible. el rey pierde espacio en el flanco y mi rey lo aprovecha. retiro mi alfil para que el peon pueda avanzar y gano un tiempo atacando al rey blanco. camino despejado, ¡a coronar! blanco sigue jugando mal y pone el rey en la diagonal de mi rey y dama. jaque a la descubierta. mate. espero les halla gustado esta partida. 
-------------------------------------
a mesma linha, como na antiga continuação 4... de7 5.c3 bb6, etc. mas aqui há uma sutil melhoria, pois se agora as brancas respondem com 5.d3 em vez de 5.d4 as pretas não precisam mobilizar sua dama para a "superproteção" do peão de e5.  outro refinamento da abertura e mais enérgico que 6....d6. agora as brancas te que tomar medidas para proteger seu peão em e4 e isso diminui suas perspectivas de ataque. um continuação mais viva aqui é 7.bg5. o lance 7.dxe5 simplifica muito o jogo, enquanto 7.d5 cb8 resulta numa posição congestionada. depois do enérgico 8.a4, este último movimento mostra uma preocupação excessiva e poderia provocar fraquezas na ala do rei. uma continuação ambiciosa seria 9. ca3. aqui existe uma cilada. se agora cxe4 então as brancas ganham uma peça com d5! após ter cumprido a missão de proteger seu peão do rei, a dama retrocede deixando livre a casa e7 para o cc6 (12.d5 ce7). aqui as brancas tinha a possibilidade de simplificar o jogo com 12.dxe5 cxe5 13.cxe5 dxe5 14.bxb6 cxb6 15.de2 etc com chances iguais. um nova manobra preventiva. o bispo não somente antecipa um 14. cc4 mas também um 14.d5, seguido de 15. bxb6 por meio do qual a estrutura de peões das negras estaria deteriorada. se 15.cxd4 então 15...cb4 melhor do que esse recuo total seria 16.be2. depois dessa investida no centro, as pretas assumem a iniciativa. se 17.f4 cg6 18.e5 ch5, com vantagem negra. tarrasch espera com esse lance realizar trocas de peças para aliviar a tensão. bem jogado, pois alem de concentrar as peças na ala do rei, o sacrifício de peão está bem fundamentado. tarrasch aceita o citado peão e não teme 21...bxh3 22.gxh3 dxf3 23.bg2 e as brancas teriam um boa posição.  a ideia por detrás dessa manobra é tirar o bispo de f1 de seu posto de observação e somente então atacar o rei sem proteção. melhor seria oferecer a troca de damas com 22. dd2 ou 22. dc1. ameaça agora 23...bxg2 seguido de 24...dg4+ 23.dd2 oferece mais resistência. jogando 24. bf1 as pretas responderiam com 24...txe1+ 25. txe1 dxd5 as brancas perderiam um peão mas teriam evitado a catástrofe que aconteceu na partida.  o ataque frontal é decisivo. brilhante! depois de 28. rg1 tem mate em dois com 28...cxf2+

τα λευκά παίζουν το <<γκαμπί του αξιωματικού του βασιλιά>> xωρίς να φοβούνται το σαx της μαύρης βασίλισσας στο θ4 αλλά ούτε και την περιπλάνηση του βασιλιά τους.  το 18ο αιωνα το υλικό δεν είxε σημασία αλλά η ταxεία έξοδος των κομματιων για την αναζητηση του αντίπαλου βασιλιά. tο σωστό είναι τα μαύρα να επιτεθούν στο κέντρο και όxι από τα πλάγια όπως έκαναν. καλύτερο ήταν 4. __ γ6  τα μαύρα θέλουν να κρατησουν το ζ4 πιόνι τους, όμως η βασίλισσα τους μένει στην άκρη και απομονωμένη. το καλύτερο θα ηταν 6. __ βθ5 με επίθεση στον β5 αξιωματικό.      τα λευκά μετακινούν τον _|ππο για να απειλησουν την βασίλισσα. (?)  η μαύρη βασίλισσα βρίσκετε σε πολύ κακη θέση.  τα λευκά θυσιάζουν ένα κομμάτι xωρίς προοπτικη να ανακτησουν άμεσα την διαφορά που έxασαν. το έκαναν για να αποκτησουν πλεονέκτημα στην ανάπτυξη τους. η θυσία αυτη είναι σημαντικη γιατί είναι η πρωτη παρτίδα παγκοσμίως αναγνωρισμένη, όπου ένα κομμάτι θυσιάζετε με αντάλλαγμα την καλύτερη ανάπτυξη.  το κυνήγι της βασίλισσας απέδωσε καρπούς. τα λευκά έxουν αναπτύξει σxεδόν όλα τα κομμάτια τους σε αντίθεση με τα μαύρα παίζουν μόνο με την βασίλισσα τους. τα λευκά αν θέλουν να εκμεταλλευτούν το πλεονέκτημα της ανάπτυξης τους θα πρέπει να παίξουν δραστηρια.  από εδω ξεκινάει ένας καταπληκτικός συνδυασμός.   με αυτήν την κίνηση τα λευκά θυσιάζουν και τους δύο πύργους τους. τέτοιες θυσίες είναι πάντα πολύ εντυπωσιακές. ο βασιλιάς των μαύρων είναι σε απειλή αλλά το κέρδος των δύο πύργων είναι μεγάλος πειρασμός για τα μαύρα! ομορφη θυσία της βασίλισσας με σκοπό να ελευθερωθεί το ε7 τετράγωνο.   
-------------------------------------
tipikal pembukaan sisilia naga, notasi komentar di sini menggunakan huruf inggris (n=kuda, k=raja, b=gajah, q=ratu). white usually disdains this capture and plays 10. 0–0–0, thinking to get on with the traditional kingside offensive, but it is interesting to see what happens if he does play the obvious move.
-------------------------------------
 putih biasa tidak mencaplok di sini dan bermain 10.0-0-0 rotasi panjang, untuk memperoleh serangan dari arah sayap raja. akan menarik untuk melihat apa yang terjadi kalau dia main langkah tersebut. rather unusual. most black players prefer to stop white’s next move with 11...ne5 first, and this is probably better than the text.
-------------------------------------
 masuk di akal. putih segera menyerang kelemahan di diagonal a2-g8. superficially, 14...nxb3+ to knock out the light-squared bishop is tempting, but it is not clear then where black’s queenside counterplay is coming from. if he cannot conjure up something, he might simply get mated on the kingside. this is an occupational hazard of playing the dragon, of course. as nigel short put it in the commentary room: “dragon players don’t really mind getting mated”, though one could hear dragon expert gm chris ward in the background saying “oh yes, they do!”.
-------------------------------------
 memainkan kuda mencaplok gajah di b3 cukup menggoda, tapi hitam tidak yakin bisa memperoleh bantuan serangan dari perwira-perwiranya dalam tempo singkat. kalau gagal, hitam bisa saja terkena skak mat, tapi ini adalah tipikal pembukaan sisilia naga. seperti kata nigel short dari ruang komentator : "pemain naga tidak pusing terkena skak mat", walaupun gm chris ward, pakar naga, terdengar menjawab "....nggak... (kami peduli)" you might find your computer gets excited at the prospect of 15...nxb2!? here, with the idea of 16 kxb2 nd5 17 exd5 rxc3 18 qxc3 bxc3+ 19 kxc3 rxf3 20 dxe6 qc6+ 21 kd2 a5, etc, but the two players were dismissive of this line, feeling that white’s rook and two bishops were more than adequate compensation for the queen. 
-------------------------------------
 di komputer mungkin terlihat menarik prospek dari 15...nxb2, dengan ide  16 kxb2 nd5 17 exd5 rxc3 18 qxc3 bxc3+ 19 kxc3 rxf3 20 dxe6 qc6+ 21 kd2 a5. tapi kedua pemain sepakat line tersebut tidak baik, dengan pertimbangan benteng putih dan dua gajah sudah cukup kompensasi untuk ratu. 18 nxe6? bxb2+ 19 kb1 rxf3 20 ng5 rxe3! 21 qxe3 bf6 gives black a very useful attack for the small material investment. besides which, white doesn’t want pawns, he wants to give mate.
-------------------------------------
 variasi di atas, hitam memperoleh potensi serangan yang baik dari sedikit kompensasi materi. selain itu putih tidak menginginkan bidak, tapi serangan skak mat. it would all too easy to fill up the page with analysis here but let’s look at just one alternative: 20...d5!? 21 exd5 nxg4 is another try if black is afraid of being mated. however, white could continue with 22 bg5!?, e.g. 22...nf2 23 d6! nxd1 24 qe6+ kh8 25 d7! and white seems to emerge with an advantage.
-------------------------------------
 cukup banyak variasi di sini, salah satu alternatif hitam 20...d!? (sesuai di atas) bisa dilangkah kalau hitam takut skak mat. tapi putih bisa main 22.bg5!? (sesuai di atas) dan putih keliatan lebih baik malah. both players were in severe time trouble by now. here nigel short thought he must be winning on the kingside but calculated that his likeliest tries were flawed, e.g. 22 rxh5!? nxe3 23 qxe3 23...rf1! 24 rh1 (24 rxh7+ kxh7 25 qh3+ bh6+ (the fact that this is check is vital, of course) 26 g5 nd3+!! is another stunning resource for black) and now the implausible 24...qd3!! comes to black’s rescue. but 23 qh2! would surely have won the game after all.
-------------------------------------
 nigel bisa segera menyerah, tapi dia dengan sportif terus bermain sampai ke bagian yang lebih nyata kalahnya, demi penonton yang ramai mengikuti. both advanced pawns can queen and ‘buy’ a rook but black has a back-up supply of potential new queens, of course.
-------------------------------------
el ajedrez se trata de crear figuras geométricas con los elementos que nos dan. el ajedrecista es como un albañil que tiene que construir puntos fuertes dentro de la estructura del adversario desde donde amenace el adversario. entonces que elementos de construcción tenemos. diagonales, que la hacen los alfiles, columnas, que las hacen las torres, vigas o filas, que las hacen las torres. remaches, que los hacen los caballos y los peones. la dama tiene varias propiedades y el rey todas las debilidades. una diagonal de peones fortalece la diagonal que ocupa y deja debilitada la diagonal que no ocupa. dos peones en el centro fortalecen las cuatro casillas sobre las que influencian y debilitan las dos casillas de los costados. dejamos un punto debil cuando hay un peon atrasado y uno adelantado. el punto debil esta en el costado del peon adelantado y el frente del peon atrasado. entonces desde ese punto domina la situacion la pieza que pongamos. es un lugar para ocupar, donde no puede ser desalojada la pieza. pero eso solo no hace ganar la partida. hay que ver el concepto y el modo de usarlo. las diagonales o columnas o filas que dominan las otras piezas se pueden obstruir con una pieza nuestra que este defendida. también se puede desviar las piezas contrarias.    con la apertura del blanco le dimos lugar a las diagonales del alfil y la dama, lo mismo hizo el negro.  el blanco amenazo el punto en e5 y el negro lo defendio con su peon.  con este avance del peon el negro debilita dramaticamente la diagonal que va de h5 a e8. debe haber una compensación a esta debilidad que da mas ventaja que esta terrible desventaja   el blanco amenaza comer la dama negra , pero previamente el negro habia amenazado la casilla f2 con su alfil y de ese modo puede sacar su dama hacia un lugar donde amenace la casilla f2 .  la dama puede ocupar esa columna y construir una estructura donde la diagonal del alfil negro de casillas negras refuerza el punto f2 porque previamente cambio su peon que obstruia esta construccion . esta debe ser la compensación a la terrible debilidad que comente previamente   este avance de peon libera la fila 2 para que la domine totalmente la dama negra.  el negro aprovecha la ventaja de la liberación de la fila para el dominio de la dama negra amenazando con su caballo la casilla c2 . el blanco antes de avanzar el peon debería haber jugado su peon de a2 a a3.  aca cuando el negro toma con el rey, no puede el blanco tomar con el peon, porque debilita su diagonal de e1 a a5. entonces el blanco se ve obligado a tomar con la dama . la fortaleza del negro esta en ocupar con su dama la fila segunda y en la amenaza de ocupar la diagonal con el alfil negro. las dos solas , la fila y la diagonal no sirven . lo que sirve es la combinacion del dominio de la fila y el dominio de la diagonal.    el negro toma el caballo que estaba defendiendo el punto en c2

il mio tipico schema d'attacco in questa apertura. lui "vede" in pieno. questa � gi� la mia mezza vittoria in questa apertura. intendiamoci, non che la partita sia vinta, ma diciamo che ho ottenuto il mio scopo, che � quello di ripiegare le nere alla difesa, e dare fastidio sul fianco di re.  il pezzo forte delle nere �, naturalmetne, l'alfiere bianco, ben rintanato. qui, ho deciso di farlo venire fuori, ma in questo modo contravvengo al principio di questa apertura, che � quello di giocare c3 per evitare problemi sul fianco di donna.  logico. e qua, per essere coerente, devo rassegnarmi allo scambio di donne. comunque, senza gli alfieri per lui era meglio cercare un attacco a base di cavalli e pedoni, gli sarebbe stato pi� utile.  l'arrocco, per me, va bene "cum grano salis". qui � senz'altro meglio questa. comunque, il mio attacco sul lato re � quasi morto, senza le donne... o no?  semplicemente. non si aspettava certo che questa mossa gli portasse tanti problemi... tutto questo sembra svantaggioso per me, perch� questa casella dovrebbe essere occupata dai miei pezzi minori. ma non portava a niente mettere l'alfiere o il cavallo l�, e lasciare scoperto il pedone e5, che adesso devo difendere. ah, qui ha definito lo schema, e quindi mi ha dato un piano d'attacco. certo che non � facile, ma c'�. prima di tutto liberiamoci dall'obbligo di difendere e5 con i pezzi minori. non importa. certo, � necessario controllare l'entrata dei cavalli, per adesso basta... certo, lui vuole attaccare. ma adesso tocca a me. avete indovinato qual � il mio piano per penetrare? grazie! questo pedone in h pu� essere la vittoria (e lo sar�), ma bisogna stare molto attenti a non perderlo. a questo punto diventa abbastanza difficile calcolare se per me � meglio cercare di avanzare sulla colonna a, o continuare sul lato di re. bene, tutto calcolato. arrivo in tempo a difendere, e ho ancora la torre libera!  non mi conveniva avanzare il pedone h difendendolo con la mia torre, naturalmente, di questo sono abbastanza orgoglioso! e qui sta il bello della posizione: la sua torre � schiava, la mia � libera... i tempi sono una bellissima cosa. posso mollare il pedone h, perch� minaccio la torre. e posso fare anche questa. guardate un po': se cxa, cf6  e vinco la qualit�... perch� se rf8, cxt , rg8, cf6  e poi h6xg7 e vinco materiale.   e io lo faccio lo stesso, guarda un po'...  adesso la torre nera � bloccata per sempre. anche il mio alfiere, ma � come se avessi una qualit� in pi�. se cambia il cavallo, perde per i pedoni. e se cxh6, con th1 vinco il cavallo! qui abbandono h6, ma in compenso vinco b4 e poi la mia torre entra in campo nemico. comunque, per lui era meglio di quella che ha fatto. benedetti tempi. se non muove il re, per esempio con cxh6, tb7 , prendo il pedone a7 e poi mi rivalgo col pedone in a. questa era la manovra giusta per far penetrare la torre. almeno credo. l'importante � che il re nero non possa minacciare il pedone in a, senn� sono bloccato.  qui, devo ammettere che non ho visto il pericolo: il cavallo fa scacco, da qui. con f3 ero assolutamente blindato, e potevo dire di aver gi� vinto. almeno re2. invece, non ho visto lo scacco... ma comunque vinco lo stesso, guardate.  se adesso rb3, ac5  e poi nessuno mi ferma pi�... attenzione alla manovra. mi chiedo se c'era un modo migliore per le nere di difendersi. se rb6, a7, unica cc7, e txc. qui era meglio direttamente txc. il fatto � che comunque la torre la sacrifico per il cavallo, tanto vado a donna! se rg7, txc e vinco. qui, la mossa era a8=d , rd7, td1#.  il famoso pedone in h, che non ha preso quando poteva, decide.

a "new" queen gambit? :-) wrong move. white has to defend the d4 pawn here, with e3. because the plan is to answer to black's bd6 with ne5, leaving the pawn unattended. this happened here, but... so, this was a simple blunder. a little one, of course, but a blunder. nevertheless... my plan to take in e5 with a pawn, one of the keys of this opening, fails...  the simple nf6 is better, but i cannot blame him for not seeing what was coming on... again, nh4 looks better, but g5 follows, and then the queen goes out...  where does this nasty pawn go? ok, now i had to choose between h4, f4, or nf3. neither look bad... but i like to be aggressive, and after some calculation... never allow such a pin! now it starts to be really tactic. one of the funniest variations i found was the following.   13. ...        rg6 14. qh5	nd6-e4 15. o-o-o	nxf2 16. rxg5	nxd1 17. rxg6	h7xg6 18. qe5	f7-f6 19. qg3	kf7 20. bd3	f6-f5 21. nf3	qf6 22. ne5+	ke8 23. bb5+	c7-c6 24. nc6	qb2+ 25. kxd1	qb5 26. qxg6+	kd7 27. ne5+	kc7 28. qxf7+	kd6 29. bf4	qb1+ 30. kd2	qb4+ 31. c2-c3	qb2+ 32. kd3	qb1+ 33. kd4	qd1+ 34. nd3+	kc6 35. qc7+	kb5 36. qc5+	ka6 37. qa3+	kb6 38. qb4+	kc6 39. qc5+	kd7 40. qc7+	ke8 41. bg5	qa4+ 42. ke5	qe4+ 43. kf6	bd7 44. ne5	rd8 45. qd6	and mate the next one, or black loses the queen.  here it goes, the dangerous queen.  risking again. a quiet way to play was to protect f2 (rg2... looks weird), or h4 or f4... but i adore tactics, and if a sacrifice is possible, i do it.  oh, playing hard... now i have to change my bishop, and all seems to stay calm, with a pawn less. not quite.  a half blunder, since it allows my bishop to come into the game aggressively. this move makes me recover the pawn, but no only this.  it opens the 5º row to my queen's action, and bishop and rook are perfectly placed for a mortal attack. black worry about his h pawn... a mortal check, due to the combined action of my bishop and rook. qc4+ was also good. but this one is a little more sadistic, since it seems to give black some chances.  ke8 is followed by bc6+... ...and the game is over. black can struggle more, and white can allow himself not to take the black's queen, with:   25. ... ke7  26. qc7+, kf6  27. qd8+, kf5  28. e3-e4+, kxf4  29. rf1+, ke5  30. qc7+, kd4  31. c2-c3+, ke3  32. qf4+, kd3 33. rf3+, kc4 34. d5+, any,  35. qb4#  sure there are more defences for black, but the game is won if white just gets the black's queen.  the shortest way to lose, but... what else?  to say the truth: my opponent was trapped in a tactics difficult to see, and i got it by chance. one of those games in which a "little" mistake leads to major material loss.   
-------------------------------------
qua ho pensato che avrei potuto cambiare i due alfieri per i miei due cavalli. il che andrebbe bene, ma poi soffro per il poco sviluppo, e non sono sicuro di avere abbastanza vantaggio. una posizione per me difficile da valutare.  allora ne ho cambiato solo uno.  qua la tentazione facile era e3, ma mi "puzzava".  qua mi aspettavo ah7, con difficoltà se prendevo il pedone. comunque, è venuta fuori lo stesso la situazione.  qua � cominciata a diventare una partita complicata.  questo secondo me è un errore, e qui ho subito pensato a cxh6, e se riprende col pedone, axh6 e la torre � intrappolata. se guadagno la qualit�, mi rimangono ben 3 pedoni completamente liberi, e anche con solo una torre per due pezzi, vinco. ma lui aveva ag3, che mi costringeva a perdere un tempo per difendermi, e cos� salvava la torre.  17. cxh6, g7xh6, 18. axh6, ag6, 19. af5*, axa, 20. dxaf5, e se cerca di salvare la torre con tf7, 21. dg6 , rh8 (unica), e poi non vedevo vittoria chiara, dopo 22. ag5, cc5-d7, anche se con i pedoni liberi avrei dovuto vincere... era una possibilit�. 23. h4, e chi lo ferma pi�? forse ho fatto male a non scegliere questa strada.   * ho provato altre mosse, per vedere se la donna poteva creare minacce, ma... se 19. dd4, con l'idea di andare in g5... cd3 ! � mortale! 20. rf1, per evitare la doppietta cxf2, e segue ce4!. se  21. dxc, txf2  22. rg1, e poi de5, e di fronte alla minaccia dxb2 eccetera, � prudente 23. de5 , dxd, 24. d4xd, txe2 con un sacco di minacce.  o 21. ..., cxf2 e non serve de5 , per af7,  22. dg5 , ag6,  23. af5, rh7,  24. axtf8, cxth1 25. axa , dxa 26. dxd , rxd,  27. ae7, te8, e forse rimango in vantaggio... ma c'� da fidarsi di analisi cos� lunghe? e comunque, non risolvevo il problema di txf2 , prima!   ho creduto di fare il furbo, con l'innaturale f3. il punto era che volevo impedire l'accesso dei cavalli neri ad e4, in modo da poter giocare, dopo 17. ag6, ce7 , che credevo vincente.   naturalmente, 17. g5 non serviva alle nere, per 18. cxh6 , r muove e 19. axg5.   e se 17. ch5, potevo ritirare l'alfiere nero, cosa che non potevo fare se giocavo prima e3. ora, anche se mi cambiava l'alfiere, prendendo con il pedone g aprivo la colonna, e magari non andava neanche tanto male.   sono posizioni difficili per me da analizzare.  a questo punto ho visto che non andava del tutto bene ce7 , anche se d'effetto. dopo le rispettive prese, ta-e8 mi obbligava a difendermi, con gioco almeno pari.   altre possibilit�?  18. o-o, doveroso e salutare. ma � anche rinunciare e dare tempo. per esempio, per ch5... e lasciare indifeso e2 (ma � poi cos� male? magari mi da il tempo per portare la torre a1 in gioco...) 18. o-o-o, addirittura, ma non mi convinceva.  18. b4, in modo da scacciare indietro il cavallo ed evitare completamente i problemi derivati da eventuali colpi di testa in e4 o d3 . e tenere duro con il cavallo inchiodato.   la risposta temuta � ce6, minacciando il mio bell'alfiere nero. dopo ce7  e le rispettive prese, rimango con un solo pedone di vantaggio, ma debole. non so se mi conviene. ritorna la minaccia del sacrificio nero del cavallo in e4.  20. af5 non serve per ch5! ok, questa � la tipica situazione nella quale bisogna decidere cosa fare a lungo andare. ho un pedone in pi� e la coppia di alfieri, non va affatto male... ma... adesso � questione di strategia. e questo � il mio problema... just in time... as predicted. di nuovo... cosa fare? come base, non volgio perdere la coppia di alfieri, mio grande vantaggio. n� pedoni, naturalmente. direi che la priorit� � quella di riorganizzare i miei pezzi per ottimizzarne l'azione. il problema � la torre in a1, virtualmente esclusa dal gioco. e la colonna f � la mia potenziale debolezza... per cui il piano, logico, di portare il re in f2 non � prudente. una di quelle tipiche situazioni "a lungo raggio", con duemila varianti, e difficili da smistare.  se txe5, axh6+ con vantaggio. intrappolato! non può difendere il cavallo con tg7, per axh6, cf5, ta-f1 ecc...  
-------------------------------------
una partita persa proprio male... solo per uso interno! forse uno sbaglio. il calcolo era scambiare gli alfieri bianchi in c2, avanzando c3, com'� tematico in questa apertura. ma non era cos� facile come credevo. non avevo fatto i conti con la debolezza di d6, avanzando c3. adesso devo correre ai ripari, e sono gi� inferiore.  e non avevo visto che se adesso proteggo il pedone con f4, mi rimane un brutto "buco" in e6, e se... ...mi vince l'importantissimo pedone in e5, prima o poi. rischiosa, ma era per "dare un senso" ai miei errori di prima. putroppo, in molte varianti la donna rischia di rimanere intrappolata.  ecco, non avevo visto neanche questa, non ora.  se non la faccio (per es. h3), significa accettare il vantaggio delle nere, che avanzano tranquillamente i pedoni sul mio re semi-scoperto. invece, se... il piano era proprio quello di smorzare l'attacco nero facendo s� che i suoi stessi pedoni raddoppiati su h gli impedissero di essere pericoloso.  purtroppo questo libera le nere da molti problemi. evidentemente, se dxa7 il pedone non compensa l'allontanamento della mia donna dalla difesa. ecco, ancora incapace di accettare la mia inferiorit�, o diciamo meglio, cercando di trarre qualche vantaggio dalla minaccia di scoperta alla donna e5-e6, corro un rischio troppo grande, e sbaglio. cero, non � facile vedere buone mosse per le bianche, dato che le semplici rh1, per continuare con tg1 eccetera, lasciano spazio a f6, con ulteriori minaccie nere (e "nere"...:-) . se perdo il pedone e5, sono nei guai. fino alla prossima nota tutto era previsto.. e adesso sembravano sufficienti tg1, scambio e via, almeno giocabile. questa non l'avevo prevista. pensavo pi� a che avrebbe allontanato il re dalla diagonale pericolosa, in d8 o g8.  per� mi permette di mettere in azione una serie di scambi, forzati per le nere, e guadagnare un pedone. il che non so bene fino a che punto � stata una buona idea.   forse dovevo analizzare prima f6!?, o e4... cio�, un'altro libro! fino a qui ancora giocabile. il pedone nero � un'arma a doppio taglio, essendo isolato, dato che si pu� perdere facilmente dopo una semplificazione, prima che il nero abbia modo di materializzare il suo vantaggio nel centro. almeno ci speravo.  questa calcolata sin da prima, pensavo innocentemente che toglieva forza al pedone in h. e qui l'errore definitivo: ho "perso" f6!, se � che era una soluzione e non un modo per perdere un'altro pedone.   volendo fare dg7, sarebbe stato meglio farla ora. e avevo sottovalutato questa.  per questa ragione.  non so perch� si sia ritirato qui, forse per darmi qualche speranza... comunque, � ovvio che qui perdo anche f5 e la partita, perch� i due pedoni in meno non hanno compensazione.  se prendeva di donna, forse riuscivo a prendere h e salvare la partita.  cos�, invece, va meglio per me.  ho analizzato molte varianti interessantissime se il nero gioca db8. rimane intrappolata, ma paralizza torre, alfiere e regina. d'altra parte, il bianco ha sempre, latente, la minaccia dg7, o pu� venire in e2, minacciando in e7... insomma, un'altro mondo. queste sono le "speranze" a cui mi riferivo prima. da notare: qui df4 del nero vinceva?  insomma, � proprio la mia giornata!!!! finisce che resto anche superiore! che bravo sono! ...e allora perch� butto via cos� la partita????  ah5 era mooooooooolto migliore!!!!   sembra incredibile, ma con tutto e il pedone h, l'attacco nero � impotente, anche con la donna nera! chiaro, mica avevo visto che perdevo anche questo pedone, in quel modo!!!!  altro che bravo, sono un idiota!  
-------------------------------------
una partita giocata abbastanza male, ma che comunque ho vinto perch�... le mie imprecisioni sono state meno gravi delle sue, e soprattutto, ho avuto pazienza e sangue freddo. ho voluto cercare di complicare le cose, ma senza molto successo. se cxc, d5xc e ad axa, e5xa, e dxc. la via dello scambio non era comoda per lui.  ritirare il cavallo era ammettere una sconfitta strategica, quindi ho cercato di far valere il mio alfiere bianco. questo era il prezzo da pagare per avere quell'abbozzo di attacco. mah... ritirare la torre era ammettere di perdere un tempo. almeno, cos�, forse nel futuro la torre avrebbe avuto pi� mobilit�, pur avendo perso l'arrocco dal lato di re. rischioso, ma coerente. senn� perch� avrei perso l'arrocco di re? se qua giocava b4, mi avrebbe creato difficolt�. me lo aspettavo, invece ha fatto questa, peccando di prudenza, secondo me. a questo punto, dovevo agire in fretta e coerentemente con il mio piano di attaccare sul fianco di re, senn� avrebbe attaccato sul fianco di donna. il pedone in c6 � la mia miglior difesa. e la torre in h2 fa sentire la sua utilit�. "devo" attaccare :-) rinunciando al cavallo in c5, rinuncio al blocco di c6, ma non potevo aspettare passivamente. ecco che il mio alfiere bianco rivela la sua utilit�.  giocando col fuoco. anche se spinge il pedone in a3, con b3 sono a posto. a parte eventuali sacrifici, che ho cercato di prevedere.  ristabilito il blocco di c6. potevo prendere di torre, mantenendo una salutare pressione su c6, ma in fin dei conti mi rimaneva debole d5, invece cos� ho la colonna aperta e occupata. ormai h7 non � pi� un buon obiettivo, il mio attacco sul lato di re � sfumato.  c5 � debole, ma lui non pu� attaccarlo troppo bene. se faceva ta5, riportavo la torre in c2, e mi rimaneva l'altra per giocare sulla chiusura del suo re. comunque, era migliore per lui di quella che ha fatto. dandomi il tempo di contrattaccare.  errore, perch� e adesso � a3 che rimane debole. b4 pu� essere difeso, questo l'ho calcolato. forse era meglio te7. questa � stata un'altra imprecisione. i pedoni cos� sono deboli.  forse non si � reso conto di perdere un pedone con questa mossa.  adesso mi aspettavo ta8 , rb2, ta8xa2, td7 e giocare sulla debolezza di f7. comunque, lui aveva due torri molto ben messe, e poteva darmi dei problemi. un po' troppo ottimista, perch�... potevo anche provare con tc5, ma comunque perdevo quelli nella quarta fila.  adesso non pu� continuare a mangiarmi pedoni, quindi cerco di scambiarli. lui ha "visto" che avevo lo scacco in g7. per�, se giocava tb5 io non potevo salvare h5 e mi sa che perdevo, o al meno ero in forte svantaggio. ma ha giocato male.  qua, sicuramente si aspettava h5xg6, ma ha fatto i conti senza l'oste. la sua torre in g6 � molto meno efficace dell'altra... hehehe con tg5  non mi metteva in difficolt�. se rb5, tb5 , rg6, e se txh5, a5 e ritornavamo alla partita... ormai � fatta. incredibile. comunque, ho dovuto ancora giocare con attenzione.  qui la tentazione era quella di fare donna, ma non ero affatto sicuro di vincere, pur con la torre, contro i due pedoni e il mio re lontano. temevo una patta insidiosa. allora... di questa sono orgoglioso, se nessuno mi dimostra che era sbagliata.  se h2, perdevo perché txt, rxt, e il mio re è sulla linea di scacco. cos� tolgo il re dalla diagonale bianca, e arrivo prima per un tempo. pu� abbandonare. 
-------------------------------------
ecco una bella variante dell'attacco di londra, con una posizione abbastanza cervellotica. forse una perdita di tempo, meglio direttamente g4 - � la base di questo attacco. per�, attenzione, gioco contro il fianchetto, che � sempre un po' meno facile.  ma anche lui non corre molto... questa mi sembra un errore. e anche qui, non vedo il vantaggio di fare questa mossa, dato l'attacco bianco che si avvicina.  cominciano i fuochi artificiali. se f3, cxc pensavo a rxc, guadagnando un tempo nel comunicare le torri e on sviando la donna dalla diagonale bianca. se per� cd6, non vedevo il vantaggio di otturare f3. oh oh, sorpresa... e qua sono io che sorprendo. � fondamentale cercare di aprire la colonna h. questa gli � proprio piaciuta. la situazione � diventata "assurda": due pezzi in presa da tre pedoni. e diventa anche molto difficile da analizzare seriamente. ma per lui era meglio non aprire la colonna h.  ho dato la precedenza ad aprire la possibilit� di dxh5, con minaccia di matto.  fantastico. qui non guadagno un pezzo se mangio l'alfiere, anzi, gli lascio vie aperte per "cose strane" con la donna in b4, o un eventuale f4... insomma, meglio andare avanti. 
-------------------------------------
 l'altra scelta era g5. s�, ci ho pensato. ma dopo f5xc, non ho visto chiara la vittoria. per esempio: g5, f5xce4. dxh7 , dxh7, txh7 , rg8, c3xad4. e... la vittoria? evidentemente, qui non prende perch� sarebbe ag5 e perde la qualit�. con questa, che mi ha sorpreso, lo ammetto, pensava di aver risolto tutti i suoi problemi, ma... ho un asso nella manica! hehe, altra sorpresa che do io... e adesso si rende conto con orrore che in poche mosse � matto, e dato che ha messo imprudentemente la torre in f7, sta pericolando dappertutto.  errore mio, era meglio tg1  e poi prendere il pedone h, che comunque � l'unico elemento che potrebbe eventualmente rappresentare un pericolo. comunque, vinco lo stesso.  e questa posizione � vinta, potrebbe abbandonare.  l'ultimo errore, fatale, ma la posizione era gi� persa...  
-------------------------------------
i lost for a blunder, but till it, it was a very interesting game. it's almost incredible, but from here i have tactical resources, due to the queen's check in h5.  maybe i had to consider g4, taking advantage on the uneasy position of his queen.  the only one. g6, bxg6. the bishop can escape, with a somewhat uneasy position, but he can't trap it. not a great advantage, but better than nothing.  i feared e5, trying to trap the bishop. i could have saved it, but it would have costed me a slight inferior position, and the bishop pair (e5, 11. dxe, dxe, 12. bb5 or 12. f4).  i must protect myself from nb4, losing the bishop pair.  i think this was better than f3, since it keeps control over the black diagonal, making impossible for him bd6 - his natural developement move. of course, be7 is still possible, but this bishop, there, is passive.  ok, now, this is one of this situations in which long-term analysis must be performed, and i don't have a clear plan. very difficult. the ideas can be:  14. f3, preventing the n to go to g4 (but... is this n a threat, there?). if nf5, i can play bf4, since he cannot threat it with his pawns, since the n would be hanging. i will lose the bishop pair, but i will win some other pawn. but i cannot stop nf5 - bd6. 14. nc3, developing and making him harder to push e5. with nf5, he allows his bishop to d6, thus exchanging it with mine. and the only way i have to stop it is bxn, but this is ugly, even if he gets a doubled pawn (not easy to take advantage of it).  ok, blocks my knight, or i go in through a4-b6 but... to where? i dind't find it a great plan.  so, the best plan maybe was kd7, and push the central pawns e4, f4... but i feared to get only a blocked center or, worse, an open column it was not completely clear to whom would have been an advantage to.  so i went to another direction, among the many possible (e. g. o-o-o): b4, pushing and try to get advantage of the weakness of his 7º rank, due to the bad collocation of his pieces. this one i eventually reached, but probably a move too late, since i played the knight in order to go e2-f4 to support an incursion in g6, either by the bishop or the knight. another plan... ok, now i forget my previous plan, and lose a tempo by moving the king. now, the "incursion" in g6 is really a desiderable objective? i must admit i didn't "do the homework", i still don't know. to change my knight for the bishop in f8 was a favour to him, so i must be sure to get something more from it, and i wasn't.  now i "see the light". a little late, maybe.  time losses due to his "mistake": not to have placed the knight in f5, instead, in order to get one of my bishop changed, either with his knight or with his bishop, a liberatory change for black. but to that plan i had some resource, still a good try for him.  to change or not to change (bxn, of course), this is the question.  if he re-takes by rook, i can make pressure over the b7 pawn with more easyness than him can defend it, and if b7xb, my a pawn is free. but i lose my bishop pair, a major advantage. it's worthwile? for now, i must defend from the knight jumps, so i lose a tempo in return to his previous one.  ah, now i see his plan. pretty good. now, i will lose my bishop pair, since i must take the knight with my beloved g3 bishop, or i would have had problems pushing my a pawn, with so many black pieces around there. i analyzed some variants leaving his knight in d6 and i didn't see a victory, so i came back to the previous "exchange" plan. but, again, with a "detour".  i decided all the game will be decided over the a and b column. this is my plan now. a pretty extrange plan for this kind of opening, but... it came this way, folks! necessary anyway, in order to threaten the b7 pawn after the exchange. and now goes the second bishop! oh, my god, am i sure? what have i done? :-)) ah!, so, he must stop my a pawn! that's good, this brings me the initiative. but it is very easy to lose this pawn, i must be very careful!  now: to check or not to check? what do i get from it?  maybe nothing. the truth is that rb2 in order to double rooks seemed somewhat weak to me. just it.  now, i started the advance, with doubts.  couriousely, i saw that rb6, in order to "block" his rooks, didn't worked because of bc7, and i cannot take the pawn because of ba5+, winning the rook. so rc6 is a bad plan. uh ok, what other plan do i have? to advance the pawn, of course.  rd7 doesn't work because bb4+ and then (whatever i move), ba5 blocking the pawn, and while i try to unblock the situation, the black king has time to go to the queenside.  i left him the b column... this is really risky.  in white square, but very far from my king. it doesn't look so good.  can i stop it? or must i go for kf4, threatening his pawns? but this is a very passive plan. after bxn, black can go with his king, and i have to look for some counterplay on the kingside, but this is really difficult, even with some "tempos". if i go into the center, he can even allow my pawn to go to e5, and just retire the bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, and i am almost blocked.  so i went for a surprising one:  a "magical" trap. 29.	..., kd8 (the king must go to d8 instead of d7 because of:  30. na4, and the black king cannot go closer to the pawn, and if the rook takes the pawn,  30. ..., rxa6,  31. nf5+ wins a neat quality. but to try to avoid it by kd8 fails, for instance to:  30.	kd3, kc8 31.	e3xe4	, kb8 32.	e4xd5, e6xd5 33.	rb1+	ka7 (assuming black's plan is to take the a pawn) 34.	ra1, kb6 (it looks as if he will achieve it) 35.	ka4+, and if kxa6 36.	kc5+, kb6 and the rook is lost again!  maybe this will never happen in the game, but i couldn't resist the temptation to find out if he would have seen the trap or not. the alternative was  29. nf4, retaining his king to this side of the board, with the result to somewhat stall the game, or if he changes his bishop for my knight, his king comes first and takes my pawn, so no good.  this doubled pawn was calculated. it looks like weak, but prevents the black king to threat the a pawn along with the rook. now he threatens the center with a pawn "mayority"! i can stop him, but the game goes to draw! he knows he can take the pawn anyway, sooner or later. so i have to look for tricks. ...and "use" my a pawn as a sacrifice in order to win a precious "tempo".   the other choice was ka6, and if he tries to push his pawn (38. ..., d3), i thought about some trick with 39. rb1, but d2, 40. rb7+, kc8, 41. kb6, d1=q, doesn't give me nothing, just for one tempo. ohter variants based on the same motive get more or less to the same point.  ah... this was what i wanted. now my king can go for the pawn.   again, 40. rb1, d2, 41. rb7+, kc8, 42. kb6 cames late. really annoying. and his goes for mine.  if he exchanges rooks, i must win due to my king's proximity to his pawns, since my doubled pawns prevent him to easily take them.  resourceful.  yes, i "must" leave him the h pawn free in order to get tempos to advance mine. at least, this was what i thought.  probably, i should have advanced my king to the other side (b4). as i said, i must take the risk.  i know i have to make him check me in order to get the king to the b column, free of checks.  here he goes. now i threat mate. i dont' want perpetual check. and here i blunder, because i am still thinking i threat mate. if only i had hold the position some more moves, i would have won. or i think so.  no hope, just for a tempo.

an interesting and very hard to analyze position in the middle game, and a long and very tactical chain, cut by a blunder from my opponent, in a very difficult position.  with the c column open, white should defend b2 with the queen, so it is important to play c3 and not e3, or black will go qb6, creating problems.  this is the good one. with black, against a london attack, is necessary to attack the white's queenside early, or the white's attack on the kingside will make you suffer. and this is another good one. the threat of bf5 forces the white to defend.  played with fear of the consecuences of black's c4. because i'll win the pawn in f5 after the bishop's exchange, but then black will have his return value on b3, and my king is still in the center.  ok, let's play keeping the unresolved tension... but i protect b3 in the meanwhile, since he protected f5 ;-) i feel inferior, now. good opening for black. and he's almost trheating to open the c column. bxb doubles a pawn, but... i don't know if it is worthwhile. if he goes c5xd4 and then nb4, i probably will lose the bishop in d3.  this passive play gives me some counterplay in order to balance the situation.  i am speculating now with the uneasy and exposed position of his queen.  i thought he would have taken the pawn, but of course i had bd4.  but now what? the plan is: 1 not to leave him castle. 2. take advantage of the d column with the rook after exchanges and if he rxb5, ne4. in some variants, it threats both the bishop (after re-taking the n in f6) and the rook. but it doesn't work.  so what? so i choosed to solidifying my pawns and take advantage of them. too bad he will castle.  i have now a very strong advanced post on d6, but at the price of giving him the black diagonal. very interesting, i think.  now it was complicated. i could see some advantage, but with a time more. my wsb and my queen are pinned, this is really embarassing. so i analyzed a lot, and took my chance. i calculated before than after bxc3, white gets advantage from his threat qxb7. he, correctly, defends b7. my calculations gave me advantage, but now it is really complicated to take advantage correctly from it.   19. rad1... defends c3, because if bxc3, be5 and black loses the bishop since he has to defend his queen. 19. rc1... defends c3, but allows the black queen to reach b5 and a6. i won't die because of that, but i'd like to "squeeze" him the most. so i considered 19. a4... the queen can go to c6, allowing him some freedom, and leaves c3. 19. ne5. prevents the black queen to go to c6, and bxn favours me, in theory. it's ok, apparently. but he has nf5, to which i should play rd1. this is the reason 19. nd4 is slightly inferior. but ne5 allows qb5. let's look for surprising and not natural moves:  19, g4... prevents nf5. but, again, loses c3. 19. ng5... because if black f5, dxe6. but again, it loses c3 without compensation.   so, this is a very complicated position for me. i cannot say i did know how to manage it correctly, i had to play "blind". after all, it seemed the most aggressive move. even if it allows... now, to exchange queens is good for him, since my queen has more activity than his. i tried to be more aggressive (always i do, even if it is not always the best idea).  and not qh5. my idea is ng5, in order to try to make him play f5, leaving the e6 pawn somewhat weak.  now, the knight is far from the king, and i can act. if i moved the queen right away to h4, nf5 grabs my good bishop or defends h6... letting definitively the pawn in c3 (and b4). i misplayed the last two moves, but now i have an attack over the kingside. tactics plays an important role here.  now, e6 is weak, but i cannot take advantage of it right now. and his pawn blocks his own bishop.  now my knight cannot be taken with the bishop. now, i have to explain that i was tempting him to take the a2 pawn! the idea is ra1, and eventually to take a7, g7, and display an attack on the 7º file. even at the cost to lose my queen pawns, i "must" find a tactical way to make my previously weak moves worth to have been played.  ok, now i am attacking e6, and it doesn't matter he will take c3. but more than that, i am aiming to d7 with my queen, since i thought a next logical move from his side would be e5... ...and he did it. if i would be a master (but i am not, i'm just an average player), i would say that you must learn to see when to leave something unattended (c3) in order to take time to create threats. and that multiple threats normally win. but i must admit i didn't see how qh3 strong was when i started my plan avoiding the exchange. what i correctly estimated was that, being my queen much more mobile than his, i must use it and not exchange it. but this is an early lesson.  but i didn't see all the comsecuences of my move.  !? observe the nd5 is "en prise", which is pretty obvious, but limits the possible move for him.  ok, now he should think about nxc3, 25. qxc3, rxn. this is good for him, since he can push his king's pawns. but my replay could have been  nxc3, 25. nxbg7, nxrd1, 26. nxre8, rxn, 27. qf3, nb2 (or he loses it), and now white has both 28. qxf6 or qxb7, that still give a good positional advantage. so, wisely, he didn't went for it. but the choice wasn't better. i wonder if black has any chance here, and my thought is "yes". but the game is very delicate for him.  ah... defending the knight, knowing the queen can move trought the white squares. well, so i have the chance to take real advantage of the 7º row, so i need to take away my knight to open the way for my queen. but i have also to eat 2 pawns up there... one is granted, but the other isn't (and, without the other, all the 7º row plan won't work).  now, i should have taken the chance inmediately with 26. qd7+, which assures me the g pawn. right moves, wrong order. ok, probably he fears the q and r conjunction in h7, and he saw that to try to defend the pawn with 27. ..., qb5, fails to 28. c4!, and black loses either the d5 knight or the b7 pawn. (kf5 doesn't work here, since 29. cxq, kxq+, 30. gxn and black cannot prevent to lose b7 and the white pawns go to promotion soon).   a plan to be considered was nxc3, , leaving the 7º row to 28. qd7+, kh6, 29. rxb7 (or qxb7), with the plan: 29. ..., ne2+, 30. kh1 (forced), ng3+!, with perpetual check.  nevertheless, white has a sadistic tactic here: 31. h2xn, qxrf1+, 32. kh2 (forced), and then... ? qxf2, and 33. qh7+, kg5 (forced), 34. qh4+, kf5 (forced), 35. g4+, and black loses the queen! of course, black can play also other moves, like 32. rh8, in which case, white will go on with 33. qh3+, kg4 (forced), 34. f4+!, exf (forced), 35. bxf4, qxb (forced), losing the queen for a bishop and a pawn.   so you see, the situation is already very compromised for black. nevertheless, i must be very careful with some surprise over my king with black q and n, since if i lose this one by perpetual or something, i will shoot myself :-) guns armed and aiming. still, you can believe it or not, i have to keep thinking.  ?! even now, a good move, since it covers very weak points, and threats the ne2+ - ng3+ sequence we saw in the last comment! nevertheless, it would have been much better nxc3, not in order to win the pawn, but to allow d4 accessible for the queen, too. this will prove to be very important for black, and a key to his loss.  in that case (nxc3), my plan would have been: 30. qg7+!, kg4 (forced), 31. f4+, and i think black is almost lost: if exf, 32. bxf4+, if kf5, 32. fxe+, and to any other king move, white queen takes pawn with check and mate in few.  with this move, i pretended to free my king from the perpetual trap.   if ne2+, 31. kg2, qe4+, f3! and the black is stopped. but if 31. ..., nf4, i must be very careful at 32. g3xn, since qe4+, and if the white king tries to escape from the perpetual threats, it will be mated: 33. kh3, qf3+, kf4 (forced) and g5+!, and ckeckmate in the next! so i have to think about all the alternatives: kh1, ke3. i won't do it here now, because it will take really very long for both of us, but you can enjoy the tactics black have, and that often lead him to mate me!  so, i cannot really assure 30. g3 this is a good move or not, but, being black, i would have gone for ne2+, without any doubt. he didn't.   very good, indeed. now, g7 is forbidden for my queen, and i analyzed qh7 without finding a clear victory.  now, it becomes very clear the difference would black had taken the c3 pawn: i couldn't have played my next one.  can i ask for a (!) here? i am threatening mate in h7. he must defend, so... now, both my checkpoints have been defended. but my attack now comes from another side. i cannot imagine (at my poor chess level) a most interesting play.  black cannot take exf, since 32. bxf4+ (threatening now mate in h7), nxb (forced), g3xnf4, and black cannot stop one of two queen's mates.  ...and not fxe, that makes me lose a tempo after f5.  forced. he cannot move the knight, or 33. qg7+, kg5 (forced), g3xf4+, winning, both if exf (qxg7+ follows), or if kf5 (fxe+ follows. in this case, he ends losing its queen for a rook, minimum. it is fun to go for it).  it seems to lose a tempo, but threats qxf6+ and pins the black knight.  the wise one. if rc-b8, re7 wins the knight. but the cavalry comes to help! now, black seems to be lost if he moves the king. kh3, 36. qf5+, qg4, 37. qxq, hxq, and with 38. rf2!, black cannot stop the following mate! very nice.  but it is not: if 36. ..., kxg3, i would have had some difficulty to go on. his king is trapped, but also is mine (by his own - awkward!), and a lost tempo anywhere can give me surprises, from perpetual to mate (look at something with qd5+....), so i have to play with a lot of care.  this is the good part, many things occurred, and i have a crushing attack, and three blessed pawns on the queenside in the worst case, but the game is not over.   anyway, he thought he was lost, so moved... do you see, kg2 would be the winning move in a standard problem, but i don't want to allow his queen to check me (and, much more important, to free herself from his pawns trap and threatening my rook). so i have to think about something more. the "simple" hxk is probably good enough to win, but i had my doubts after rc-g8 (maybe rg7 is enough to win, but you never know... black always has kxg3 and i cannot mate, neither win the queen with a check with the rook because of the damn pawn in e5, covering f4! so, it will take too long to analyze! but in some lines i saw, i got saved only by my pawns, or not even that... i still need to be careful!).  let's see what happens not taking the knight... now.  ok, maybe i am crazy. but now i am threatening rf4!, so the king cannot go to h4. the only other move is exb. after which, qg4+, qg5 (forced: if kh3, rf3#), after which i must exchange the queens (if i allow kxh5+, surprisingly... i would be mated in few moves!), and then i will win with my pawns (and his king so far... curiously, if he checks me rg8, he goes mated in few moves... can you see this?).  but... is there anything better? 38. qxe5+,  38. ..., kh3, 39. qe3+!, kxh4 (forced, unless black wants to interpose the knight), 40. rf4+ qxr (forced), 41. qxq+, kh3, 42. qxn, and rg8 doesn't help because of 43. rg7, rxr, 44. qxr, re8, 45. kf2! and white mates in few moves! 38. ..., kg4. if i take the knight, i get stalled in perpetual checks, with care not to lose a tempo, or i can try 39. qf5+, kh3, and we are in pretty the same position i just analyzed it, with the big difference that i cannot play the winning qe3+!  so i have to look for another move after kg4.  maybe 39. rg7, rc8, 40. qxg4+, and mate.  since i cannot see any other good move by black, i think i have won the game... let's see if it is true.  well, this is a blunder, or i was right. but it was a blunder, because all other variants are much longer. now, even if there is no inmediate mate he loses the queen and any hope.  
-------------------------------------
per adesso, una bella trappola d'apertura. sbaglio. in questa apertura, non si pu� permettere di lasciarsi indebolire g6, perch� la penetrazione sulle caselle bianche da parte del bianco � terribile.  l'unica alternativa, evidentemente, era di usare l'alfiere. forse era meglio, in quanto dopo non poteva essere scambiato con la donna nera. d'altra parte, non minacciava di prendere in g7 n� nient'altro.  e adesso. come proseguire l'attacco? non � cos� facile come sembra.  1) h4, per portare l'alfiere in h3 e attaccare e6.  sembra la pi� ovvia, ma dopo ...de8, lo scambio delle donne � inevitabile, e il mio attacco si smorza. allora pensiamo a  2) ad3, in modo che poi sia l'alfiere ad occupare g6.  comunque, il nero ha due buoni salti di cavallo in b4 e c4, di cui bisogna tener conto... se non riesco ad arroccare di donna, finisce che devo difendermi. c'� anche  3) df7, e se ...de8, porto avanti il pedone in g6. dopo lo scambio delle donne, quel pedone rimane debole e pu� cadere, ma intanto io sto attaccando c7, ed eventualmente posso portare il cavallo in b5.   allora, non vedendo chiaro il modo di proseguire direttamente, ho fatto cc3, pensando a sviluppare i pezzi prima di proseguire l'attacco. se de8, ad3, e se ...cb4, dxd e poi ag6.  ha preferito sovradifendere. i temi qui rimangono quelli di prima. tutto � molto ricco e complicato.   1) df7 .  1a) se si copre d'alfiere, prendo g7, e poi c'� una lotta per scacciare la donna e prendere g5, che per� vinco io, perch� la donna finisce col prendere h5 e poi coprire il tutto con h4. quindi, lui non la far�.  1b) si copre di donna. allora, l'unica coerente � g6, scambio di donne (e non � forzato, occhio), e rimane il mio pedone bianco in f7. se re7 per prenderlo, io posso prendere in c7 direttamente, o usare il cavallo in b5. in entrambi i casi, non vedevo chiaro se mantenevo l'iniziativa (ci sono sempre i salti dei suoi cavalli da tenere in conto). 1c) pu� anche rifugiare il re in c8, e qui non so proprio come andare avanti. avrei solo un pedone in pi�, magra consolazione!  2) h4, con l'idea ah3. questa viene contrarrestata come prima, da de8.   3) cb5, con l'idea di minacciare c7, da dove poi si minaccia e6. ma con tc8 mi blocca. e poi, dato che pu� sempre tagliarmi la ritirata (o l'appoggio, a seconda se mangio c7 di alfiere o di cavallo), pu� anche permettersi di offrire lo scambio di donne e lasciare in presa c7, poi con la torre mi guadagna due pezzi. o, dopo lo scambio di donne, ad6 e chi si � visto si � visto.   4) ab5. blocco il cavallo, ma a che pro? a parte che con a6 mi rimanda indietro.  l'unico vantaggio pu� essere che se axc, poi il mio alfiere nero � libero di occupare e5 e attaccare g7, e poi avanzare il pedone in f fino al debole f5.  non pu� proteggere direttamente con la torre in g8, per df7 , ma pu� portare il cavallo in c4, minacciandomi due punti (e3 e b2), ma soprattutto minacciando di scambiarmi l'alfiere. posso fare direttamente axg7, non gli rimane che axa, dxa , e adesso dopo d37 praticamente non mi rimane molto, solo lo scambio e poi perdere a mia volta uno dei due pedoni minacciati dal cavallo. e nel finale, gli rimane un pedone di meno, e i due raddoppiati sulla colonna c, e quello isolato in a. vantaggio sufficiente per  altra posizione da 2000 varianti.  e4xd5 kxd5 rxd5 qf5  bb6 h4 ?????????  
-------------------------------------
  an excellent example of a ‘complicating move’ ... and a move that i normally don’t handle well at all.  now i'm faced with a position that only a couple of moves ago concentrated on the k-side (with a bit going on in the center) that now stretches from k-side, through the center to the very extent of the q-side.  with 16. na4 and 17. ... qa5 we’re now playing laterally across the whole board.
-------------------------------------
 not only do i have to deal with a vastly expanded playing field, i have to figure out how much a threat (and what kind of threat) qa5 actually is!  it’s subtle ... and insidious.  it does not ‘force’ me to take any action at all ... the knight is protected by white’s queen.  but i now must think past the current state of play and down the road of ‘what happens to the queen if things start to break loose on the k-side or the center?’ ... ‘what then?’
-------------------------------------
 anyway, 26. re3 seems to be the popular choice here ... but i'm not clear on how that allows nb3 in the near-term. i didn't see the follow-up bishop fork that would give up a piece.  i was still beating myself over ra1 and didn't have my head in the game.  i was thinking, 'up some material ... let's trade queens!' had to move one of them.  here i at least attack a rook. ok ... protected passed pawn in the center.  maybe there's something left in this position after all! my first thought is re3.  maneuvering my rooks behind my advanced pawns will be very difficult with black's light-squared bishop still on the board ... as will freeing my king should the need arise.  if i can get my rook to d2 or d4 then the forward d-pawn will be a bit more secure.  whatever the case, black is getting ready to play rd8, but the d-pawn is (for a move or two) covered by white’s bishop ... but then the pawn can’t move forward without a rook backing it up. however, with the knight coming into play i have to make sure i get the rooks and king are on different colored squares ... hummm, three pieces and two colors ... that really is going to be a trick! the second choice is be5 ... but there an eventual f6 (backed up by something of course) forces it away, maybe back to where it is now.  so that’s sort of a bust.  although the bishop really lacks any scope where it is, it seems to be doing its limited job fairly well. and that brings us to a4.  not a great move ... but it does protect the b-pawn.  and, now that i think about it ... black is going to drop the knight onto d4, threatening nxb5 or nc2 forking the rooks.  so, to keep from dropping the pawn white has to cover it this move.  i think a4 does that.  black obviously has a lot of optional responses ... but at least it works for one move.  in retrospect, i failed to realize how powerfully black's bishop was positioned.  re3 was again the best move.  expected ... and brutally effective. although this looked logical at the time, i think re3 (a third chance!) and sacrificing the exchange would have been interesting.  35.  re3  nc2 36.  rxf3 nxa1 37.  a6  white is down material but is more active. trying to create something out of thin air ...  36. rb4 was at least a chance (not much of a chance to be sure).  white has three (3!) passed pawns, two of which are backed by rooks ... and has managed to get into a dead lost position!!  black's piece placement is perfect.  and the instructor graciously offered the student a draw. 
-------------------------------------
 score: +0.18 probably, my opponents intention was not to lose tempo in case of 18.rxe3 d5, where he should have retreated with the knight in a more defensive position, as d, as my next move would have been d4, pushing my pawn forward and chase his knight, if he retreated to e3. if he chose 19.exd5 cxd5, no problem, he should have retreated with the knight, and i gained tempo anyway. aiming for qd7 and then qg4 probably connecting rooks here the computer suggests that white's best move would have been kh2 the computer analysis suggests that my best move would have been qh3+, aiming for 20. ke2 ne6 21. qd1 nf4+ 22. kd2 d5 23. rh1 qe6 24. exd5 cxd5 25. kc1 rab8 26. rb1 d4 27. nc4 rb5. now, after the game, this sequence of moves makes sense to me, as i really could gain more pressure on white's king, however, during the game i tend to focus on material advantage and when i saw that after qh3+ i couldn't capture his knight, i considered this move to be pointless, not seing the potential check with my knight, but centralizing my pawns was also a good move, which gave me the score of +0.60 now i fully control the center. my score is +0.93 preventing qh3+ pushing my pawns here i offered a trade while i was up positionally, however, by getting rid of two central pawns, i could open the game and increase my pieces mobility score: +1.12 the computer characterizes this move as a mistake, and recommends 26. rad1, following qf5 27. qxf5 bxf5 28. ne2 nc5 29. b4 be6 30. na5 d3 31. cxd3 bh3+ 32. kg1 nxd3. even if the computer suggests that it is a mistake, as 26. nc4 nd6 27. qxd4 be4 28. f3 nxc4 29. qxc4 qxc4+ 30. bxc4 bxc2 31. kf2 bd3 32. c5 gave me an advantage of +1.26 and recommends qg4 26. rxe4 rxe4 27. qxc7 ree8 28. qg3 qxg3 29. fxg3 bxc2 30. rc1 rc8 31. nc4 bd3+ 32. kf2 bxc4 33. bxc4, which could give me an advantage of +3.50, i was almost sure that my opponent will try to attack my queen, forgetting about en passant mistake: +4.09 » 27. c4 dxc3 e.p.+ 28. nc4 c2 29. kg2 nc3 30. ne3 qc6+ 31. kh2 rd2 32. nf5 nb1 33. rc1 re4 34. nh3 rxf4 35. ne7+ kh7 36. nxc6 rxh4

 best: +21.14 » 35. kf1 rg4 36. f3 bb1 37. rxb1 qxf3+ 38. rf2 qd3+ 39. re2 qxb1+ 40. kf2 rxe2+ 41. kxe2 qxa2+ 42. kf3 qxh2 43. g6 rg3+ 44. ke4 qxh4+ 45. kd5 i like this move. not only it discovered the attack from re8, it prevented the opponents king to run to d1 he could hold for one more pair of moves, giving up his queen, but it was pointless

sacrificio più che accettabile, se mi mangiava il pony per lui sarebbe stata quasi finita, con la colonna h libera, il pedino avanzato protetto e la donna che con un passo si sarebbe trovata nella colonna h. questa mi ha rotto i coglioni tutta la partita qui tra un pò mi veniva un colpo, per prendere il cavallo ha involontariamente fatto cadere la regina, pensavo volesse mangiare con quella. un pò di pressione, tanto non poteva muovere il pony chiaramente un pò di pressione anche lui da qui perdo un sacco di tempi qui per me lui ha sbagliato io ho sempre il cavallo inchiodato e la donna quasi, sempre lì a proteggerlo, ora dimmi se una donna si deve sacrificare così ce l'ho fatta a liberare il cavallo ma ora io ero convinto che spostasse la donna invece avevo previsto male qui ha risbagliato, se la metteva in b3 lasciava spazio per l'alfiere  qui se avesse mangiato avrebbe perso una torre qui ho sbagliato, volevo altri pezzi a proteggere c6 e ciao ciao cavallo e qui ri ho sbagliato, ero convinto che volesse pattare, ripensandoci era solamente a 2 scacchi da qua in poi è stato un pianto, non c'è bisogno di dirlo e ho risbagliato a cambiare la torre adieu, mi sono arreso, era l'ora 
-------------------------------------
questa non l'ho proprio capita, non era meglio d5? secondo me è stato questo l'errore decisivo anche qua per me ha sbagliato, si era concentrato per fare la guerra da quelle parti senza guardare dove volevo attaccare io qui per me ho sbagliato, meglio f5, lui mi avrebbe potuto bloccare  qui siamo in un punto critico, volevo concludere elegantemente con 17) df7+ rc6 18) cb4+ rc5 oppure rb6 e 19)matto con ae3.. però se invece di spostare il re avesse parato lo scacco con l'alfiere avrebbe nello stesso tempo liberato la torre, dunque m'è toccato desistere. qui mi sà che era nel pallone finita con calma perchè non mi rinvengo nei finali e qui si è arreso 
-------------------------------------
curioso che inizi col bianco e sia cotretto a difendermi da subito qui mi avrebbe dato noia se avesse voluto scambiare le regine qui ho sudato freddo, se avesse fatto, anche prima, dh4+, probabilmente avrei risposto con g3, al che lui dh4 e f3 sarebbe stato difendibile solo tirando fuori il re non ricordo perchè non d4 qua invece di mettersi in vantaggio di un pedone ha preferito tendermi un'imboscata errore fatale, per mettersi in vantaggio di un pedone secondo errore, forse mi voleva indurre a dare subito scacco

so this was the first game of the season in the shropshire league for oswestry a. thankfully we won 5-0 to go top of the league! so it starts conventionally enough. i am hoping to play a grünfeld defence. but he doesn't play nc3. so i calmly complete the fianchetto. as does he. i was tempted to castle and go into king's indian type positions, but i decided instead on what i always call the semi-grünfeld, because that is what max euwe calls it in his book, "the road to chess mastery", although no one else seems to call it that! he seems to be "threatening" e2-e4 now, so i play the usual grünfeld move. this. he plays this, rather than the more combatative cxd5. i castle. so does he. i support my pawn on d5 and also with a threat. which he ignores. so i take. he grabs the centre. i support my pawn on c4 he advances hoping that he will exchange on d5 and i can take back with the pawn and straighten out my pawns. but he centralised his knight. aleksic, nenad (2435) vs. dinic, dragan (2270)		1995 continued with a4. i develop. he sacrifices another pawn to break up my pawns. so i thought i may as well take. attacking e6, threatening a fork of my queen and rook. so this protects it with my bishop. he attacks again. i defend again. he attacks it yet again. i am two pawns up. i am planning on giving up the exhange for a pawn, leaving me with three pawns for the exchange and an overwhelming position. he hops in. i leave my rook en prise, and take an important central pawn. he takes. i finally move my bc8. he takes back. and so do i. so for the sake of a small amount of material (rook for knight & pawn), i have established a huge centre, all my pieces are on good squares, his most attcaking pieces have been exchanged or driven back. in short black now has a massive advantage.  he decides to re-centralise his knight. opening up the long diagonal, making it hard for him to develop his bc1, and also pushing my passed pawn nearer to the queening square. he tries something on the king side, but he just doesn't have the central control or the development to do anything successfully. stopping his knight from coming in on e6. threatening the pawn on h7. easily prevented. knight hits the queen. he seems to think he is winning a pawn, but i had seen all this, and he is sleep walking into a trap. the queen moves. this is what he had planned, but it is a massive mistake, throwing away a piece. because i have this, and his queen has no squares. his only hope is this counter-attack.  after a lot of thought i decided to take the queens off. i have many other winning moves, but i decided this was the simplest, transposing into an easily winning endgame. he takes back the queen. i take his bishop. i now have knight, bishop and two pawns for the rook, but what is more, my pieces and pawns are in a dominating position. he protects his b pawn. again, there are various ways to win. this seemed the best, if he takes on g5 it means that his knight can't get back to help stop the black pawns, and 26....c3 or 26.....bxb2 both win very easily. so he took. i take back. trying to hold back my pawns. centralising my rook, and preparing to penetrate on e2. he prevents that, but allows another exchange. so i take. he takes back. and now, his position hopeless, he resigns. many thanks for reading. please leave a comment or two, and rate the annotation on the star system, to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader!

najdorf; now i learned. hehe, i know it so wellll my favorite defense (so, you know you can't play it with me for next games ) :-) the strongest attack i think i now prefer to play black with najdorf... classic one classic of classic preparing the castling that will never come the brave move! 2 pawns and an attack for the bishop... it is a good idea, of course... and now 3 pawns! not quite sure this is the best move i made. but i considered the 2 others -kf8 and kd8- and i did not like them.  excellent move not kxf6 followed by the terminating rxd7 bad pawn structure; was qxc3 not better? the good news is that i save my rook... increasing the pressure... but at what cost! now the "épreuve de force" starts: white still has the attack, but black can try to reduce it. reducing accepting the reducing. many threats... looking for forks and mate... blocking some possibilities scary, isn't it? with confidence  gnap come to meeeeeeee (of course to avoid the fork) really, i felt confident, here... avoiding the trade and attacking again... these whites are sharp... black still thinks about escaping the attack and grouping its force on the white king at the same time: seen how the three pieces are pointing undirectly on it? this means: black, you have to lose e6... but i decided not to lose e6! still looking for an attack to produce... but black has more margins now. the last possible threat could come from the 2 pawns on f and h columns...  defense again... for the last time and now... attack threatening too many things: can you see them all? 
-------------------------------------
i have prepared an interesting idea (see my 9th move) especially for this game, primarily to surprise my opponent. as a child, i used to be an 1.e4 player, then at the age of 10, i basically switched to 1.d4. in this game i chose the english, which is opening i only rarely employed in my career. i found a good number of games of maia's in the database with this position, so far everything was going according to my plans. a smart move to prepare e6–e5, which effectively neutralizes the battery of bishop and queen along the a1–h8 diagonal. if 8...bb7 9.g4 works well. ! this new idea was the whole reason, why i chose this opening setup. this concept is certainly an exception from the rules, which is: castle early and keep your king safe. after my last move it will be clear that it would not be safe to castle to either side of the board, as both b4 and g4 has already been played.  the standard move is 9.g3 instead. black could not play immediately 9...e5?!, as then white has 10.nxe5! dxe5? 11.bg2 trapping the rook in the corner. now that the knight is attacked, it has move, and it can only move to squares that hold on to the g7 pawn to avoid the checkmate. the best move. also after 10...ne8 i planned also 11.rg1. the natural follow up of my last two moves. it was important to move my rook out of the pin and to liberate my knight. ! again the best defense. at this point i started having some doubts about my game plan. but as maia was spending considerable amount of time so far, i was hoping that eventually she will make some inaccuracies/mistakes. with this move, i pretty much completed development, except for my king being stuck in the middle and my rooks not connected. i was a lot more worried about 12...f5!? 13.gxf6 qxf6. the tactic with 13.nxe5 dxe5 14.qxe5 did not work here because of the tricky 14…nd3+! 15.exd3 re8 counterpunch. the key moment of the game. maia spent a lot of time here, but fell into my trap, due to a miscalculation. ? maia did not miss my upcoming combination, just misevaluated the position at the end of a key variation. 13...nc6 was the best alternative. if 13...nd7 i was going to play 14.rg4 threatening 15.rxf4. !! at first it seems like a typical combination the open up the long diagonal. however, it is much trickier than it looks. this is what maia was hoping for, she made this response rather quickly. some other interesting variations were: 14...gxf5 15.nc6 and white is winning. 14...dxe5 15.qxe5 f6 (if 15...ng2+ 16.rxg2) 16.qxf4 gxf5 17.gxf6+ kf7 (17...kh8 18.f7+) 18.rg7+ ke8 19.qe5. 14...re8 15.nxf7 and black is lost. 14...qe8 when i first noticed this defensive idea, i almost gave up on the knight sacrifice altogether, as i could not move my knight from e5 due to the checkmate on e2. luckily i found an elegant counter blow with 15.be4!!. and after15...bxe4 16.ng4! is most accurate and if 16...nd3+ 17.qxd3! bxd3 18.nh6 checkmate. actually, the relatively best defense was 14...qe7! and after 15.be4!! dxe5 (if 15...bxe4 white wins after 16.nc6! nd3+ 17.kf1!) 16.bxb7 nxe2! (after 16...qxb7 17.qxe5 f6 18.qxf4+ white has a winning advantage.) 17.kxe2 qxb7 18.qxe5 f6 19.qe6+ rf7 20.gxf6. white is two pawns up, but black still has some hope to save the game. the idea behind black's "counter-sacrifice" (with 14…nxe2) is, that if now 15.kxe2 dxe5 and i could not take 16.qxe5?? due to the pin with 16...re8. !! not enough that my queen, rook and bishop was already hanging, this move just puts the knight also under attack. if 15...kxf7 white wins quickly with 16.qg7+ ke8 17.bf6 rf7 18.qg8+ rf8 19.qe6+. ! the key point of the entire combination! but not 16.nxd8?? rxd8 17.be6+ kf8 18.bxc3 re8 and black wins! my opponent calculated this far, only thinking that her rook is still on the board on f8 and that she is up a piece. here white has a clearly winning position (being up an exchange and a pawn). unfortunately, i forgot the famous advice: when you see a good move, look for a better one!  instead i played the natural  and missing the appropriate finish to this otherwise elegant game i was short on time so i was not able to spot the best move 20.rb1! and black helpless against the rook swinging over to h3 via the third rank. 20...gxf5 (20...bf3 21.rb3 bh5 22.be4) 21.rb3 and checkmating with rh3 next. if 29...rxc4? white can force the exchange of rooks with 30.rd1 rd4 31.rxd4 cxd4 32.rxa7 with an easy win. if 36...nxh2+ 37.kg2 ng4 38.rd4 ! of course moving the king out of the check to the g file is fine two, but this simplifying combination seemed simpler to me. and black resigned as the connected passed pawns on the a and b files are unstoppable.

-------------------------------------
on tuesday september 20, malpas & oswestry 1 lost their first fixture at their new venue of the bull, shocklach, malpas, 4-1 against the liverpool giants, atticus. atticus turned up with a very strong team, while malpas & oswestry 1 were missing a couple of key players. the first result was on board 3, when graham ives lost to tim wiseman. charles lowick higgie was the next to finish, losing with white on board 2. the next result was on board 4 where celeste mccrann produced the only win for the home side. orlando bell lost on time, a few pawns down on board 5. finally brian whyte finally succumbed on board 1 in a long closely-fought game. full result: brian whyte(184) 0 steve kee(182) 1 charles lowick higgie(166) 0 luke boumphrey(176) 1 graham ives(124) 0 tim wiseman(126) 1 celeste mccrann(113) 1 steve burge(127) 0 orlando bell(64) 0 steve philp(120) 1. in this game, he plays an opening variation which i had forgotten the best continuation! i fight back, and gain an edge, but fall for a clever trap and lose horribly. enjoy! king's indian defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence sämisch variation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence,_s%c3%a4misch_variation usual development. these are all the mostly played moves. 7....c6 is played slightly more usual than 7....nh5, but both are commonly played. i was trying to remember the best move here. i looked at 9. g3 nxg3 10. bf2? nxf1! with advantage to black. what i should have played was david bronstein's queen sacrifice 7...nh5 8.qd2 qh4+ 9.g3 nxg3 10.qf2 nxf1 11.qxh4 nxe3, where black has given up the queen for two bishops and a pawn, and will also win a second pawn after 12...nxc4. in return for the material, black obtains a solid and compact position devoid of weaknesses, the safer king, and control over the dark squares. cherniaev and prokuronov were sceptical of whether black had sufficient compensation after 12.qf2, but the line is very dangerous if white plays nonchalantly. also my opponent obviously knew this variation better than me, so perhaps it would have been hard for me to convert! but now i am at a disadvantage in that my opponent knows this variation better than me. i had to think, while my opponent continued to play very quickly. so played this instead. he offers the exchange of queens. i did consider playing be3 and accept a repetition, but afterwards he said he would not have accepted a draw, maybe withdrawing the queen to e7 after checking on h4 again.   however i knew this was going to be a close match, and we were badly out-rated on board 5, i had white, i was only slightly out-rated - i felt i should play on. afterwards my opponent claimed that this was a positional blunder, as it leaves black with a strong pawn on f4, opens up the long black diagonal, and the e5 square to use. however this exchange does score ok for white in opening database. afterwards i found out that g4 and ng-e2 were the moves previously played her. my opponent afterwards said that this was to prevent nb5. i then asked should i have played nb5 the move before. he replied it wasn't too much of a problem for black with na6 followed by bd7. i continue to develop. he has a plan to put his knight on e5 but my knight also finds a strong central square. he hits my bishop. in in the light of what happens next, maybe 0-0-0 would have saved me some tempi! challenging my knight. but i want to keep it there. the best way to recapture. centralising my rook. attacking b2. protecting, and completing my "castling by hand". continuing to develop. preventing the exchange of my bishop, opening up the d file for my rook, and also protecting f3, and hence preparing g2-g4. if i play g2-g4 immediately, he can  take en passant, play c6-c5, driving my nd4 to another square, followed by ne5xf3. he also develops. i continue with my plan. he retreats. with thoughts of nc2 followed by doubling rooks on the d file. i wanted to overprotect c4 in case he wanted to play be6. so he protects d, rendering my plan useless. also black is now threatening c5, driving away my nd4, and then nxf3 or g4 discovering an attack on my nc3. but i have this attacking rd8. so he moves the rook. and i have this. i did see the combination my opponent played, but i thought "what of it? material will still be level, as i gain the pawn on f4 and i get rid of his strong knight on e5, his strong pawn on f4, and i am left with pressure down the d file. so he continues with his plan. the only square for the knight. i actually thought taking on g4 was better, as this capture draws my bishop onto a better square. i take. he takes back. and i restore material equality, his d6 is now attacked twice. so he protects. i hit the bishop. bishop withdraws. i double on the d file. this move is an ingenious trap - into which i fall! i felt i had to take now, before he protects d6 again. after the game my opponent and i were looking at variations such as 28. ne3 be5 29. bxe5 dxe5 30. nd5	bxd5 31. rxd5 re6 which appears to be positional advantage to white. but i just took. ok, what would you play as black? did you find this? it is a killing check! blocking the check with knight or rook just drops the bishop on d6, so my king is forced onto the b file. which loses the c pawn and the exchange. i protect the bishop again, as it is losing a protector. he takes. i take back. another strong move. my rook retreats. attacking h2 and also, indirectly, d6. hoping to make something of this attack on c4 and f7. he takes. i take back. he throws in a check. the pawn on d6 will fall. if ka3 it falls with check to his bishop, which then takes on h2. if king moves to b1 or a1 rxd6 threatens rc-d8 and as i have to meet that threat, the pawn on h2 goes too. i didn't fancy playing on the exchange and two pawns down against a player of his quality, so i resigned.  many thanks for reading! please leave a comment and rate this annotation on the star system, so i know how i am doing with my annotations. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
so he plays the english. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_opening 1...e5 white has black's position in the sicilian but with an extra tempo. this is often called the reversed sicilian, though others call it the king's english. bruce leverett, writing the english chapter in mco14, stated, "it is natural to treat the english as a sicilian reversed, but the results are often surprising—main lines in the sicilian defense correspond to obscure side variations in the english, and vice versa." natural development. i too keep options open. he offers the four knights variation. this is actually less popular and less successful that nf6, but i thought it was more aggressive, hopefully leading to a king-side attack. he prevents 4.....e5 i develop. and this is the most common reply. it is now a reversed levenfish variation: 1. e4 c5 2. nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. nxd4 nf6 5. nc3 g6 6.f4 so i continue to develop. it is not bad, but the fourth most popular move according to my databases! he completes his fianchetto. in chess the fianchetto (italian: [fiaŋˈkɛtto] "little flank") is a pattern of development wherein a bishop is developed to the second rank of the adjacent knight file, the knight pawn having been moved one or two squares forward. i continue with my development. he completes his development. i didn't want him playing na4 winning the two bishops, although i see now that 7....0-0 is more common. i'm getting out of my opening databases now. i can only see one game with this position, pupols, viktors (2223) vs. charbonneau, pascal (2405) 2002.05.18 in that game black castled instead of retreating the bishop. he advances in the centre. i advance. knight drops back, covering d3, reducing the power of nb4-d3 which would just drop a pawn now. i finally castle. he prepares queen-side expansion. i am dreaming of securing my centre with c6 and d5. he continues with his plan. and me with mine. he advances again. i take. he takes back. more development. not quite sure what he is planning. i am planning rf-c8 to gang up on c4. securing his knight at b5. as per my plan. he attacks my bishop the only square for the bishop. he takes my bishop. i take back. and now his bishop has a lovely unopposed long diagonal. with the threat of be2. i was rather expecting 20. f3 or maybe 20. f4 now, preventing the loss of material, but leaving his e pawn very weak after i take on f3. e4 becomes a lovely square for my nf6 to move to in due course. but he allows me to play it. so i jump in. this again was a bit of a surprise - i am not sure whether it is better to lose the exchange or a couple of pawns with 21. re1 allowing 21....bxc4 followed by bxd5. what do you think dear reader? i took the offered material. he takes back. with ideas of going to e5. he hits my rook. rook retreats - i didn't fancy ra6 where it may be hit with c4-c5 opening up a discovered attack from his bf1. attacking b7, although if he takes on their immediately i can take on a4. i threaten nf3+ followed by nd2 forking his qb3 and rook b1. so he takes it off. i take back. i think he was planning on advancing d5-d4 so i block that. i now have a plan to blockade his pawns on d5 and c4 so that his bf1 remains with very limited scope. perhaps preparing to advance his c pawn. so i block it. attacking e5. which is easily protected. perhaps dreaming again of attacks down the b file. i want to secure things, fixing his pawns on white squares. not sure what he was planning. i protect b6. perhaps with ideas of trying for d5-d6 again. i block. he takes. i take back. i am not sure what he is trying to do. i think i have neutralised any counter-play he may have had for the exchange. i know decide to march my king to the queen-side before opening a file or files on the king-side to deliver the coup de grâce - or so i thought! so off i go! not sure what he is trying to do. another step. this again rather surprised me. i now rather wanted to stop h4-h5, although i am not sure if it is really any good for him. so i played this. this struck me as a rather random king move. so i continue my king-march to the queen-side. this rather surprised me too. rather than wait for the coup de grâce he blasts open the position. but is straightens out my pawn formation. so i take. he takes back with the king - his c pawn drops if he takes back with the bishop. i continue my king-march. maybe played on the basis of exchanging pawns but not pieces if you are materially down? i want my king tucked away on a7. he is now threatening to take on f5. so i protect f5. he takes. i take back, threatening e5-e4 forking king and bishop. so the bishop runs. maybe this final king move was not needed, but i wanted to avoid any tricks with a pin along the b file. any views dear reader? not sure of the point of re3. i throw in a check. king retreats. my rook prepares to scurry across to the king-side. he centralises his queen. preparing f5-f4. rook comes back across. i double up on the g file. with the idea, if i play f5xg4 then he can take my pawn on e4. so i protect the pawn on e4. threatening my a pawn. we were both getting short of time here. i thought "well what of it? if i play f5-f4 and he plays 49. rxa5+ after kb7 i am threatening both bxra5 and f4-f3+ winning his bishop. he can't cope with both threats surely?" so i plough on. he takes. according to plan. this was the move i missed. i throw in the check. king moves. my queen advances, threatening mate. and, with only seconds left on his clock, my opponent offers a draw, which i accepted.  it is now a very complicated position, and i am not sure what is going on here. obviously i can't play kb8 which loses to 53.	qxb6+ kc8 54. ra8+	mating. what do you think dear reader?  many thanks for reading. please rate my annotation on the star system, and leave a comment or two. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
at last i win a game again! lovely feeling after losing my first game of the season. it was a crucial win, helping my team to a 3-2 win. http://www.wirralchessleague.uk/results.php?club=malpas_oswestry&team=1 mind you i did out-grade him. so it starts with a grünfeld defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence he goes with the exchange variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence#exchange_variation:_4.cxd5_nxd5_5.e4 i take back. he attacks the knight. i take. he takes back. i develop. in a similar position - after 1.	d4	nf6 2.	c4	g6 3.	nc3	d5 4.	cxd5	nxd5 5.	e4	nxc3 6.	bxc3	c5 7.	nf3	in his excellent book, "the road to chess mastery" (1966) the former world champion described this move as 7. nf3(?) "white attempts to defend the knight a third time. but at any time black can nullify this defence by pinning the knight with ....bg4. therefore 7. nf3 is not adequate. white should have played 7. bc4 followed by 8. ne2." that was an accurate assessment of chess theory at the time. however in the 1980s an alternative method of development was found, making 7. nf3 playable after all. bill hartston's 1970 book "the grünfeld defence" also makes no reference to this move. i just carry on developing. this is part of the new system. by attacking b7 white makes it harder for black to play bc8-g4. white also prepares to advance his d pawn without having to worry about ....bg7xc3 followed by .....bc3xra1. i carry on with the usual development moves. as does he. i did pause here. here there is a very reasonable alternative to what i played - that is the usual exchange of pawns on d4 followed by throwing a queen check on a5. after cxd4 10. cxd4 qa5+ the pawn sacrifice 11. bd2, giving up the a2 pawn, scores well for white - but may be playable. but instead i play this, inviting a different pawn sacrifice. which is this! i see now on the opening databases that usual is to decline the pawn with 10....ne5, but i had it in my mind that the best line was to take the pawn and then give it straight back. so i took. he blocked. i took. he took back. and i offer the pawn back. i see now on the opening databases that 12....na5 is more common. he takes. i take back. this was the first real surprise, and the first time i stopped for a decent think. i try to hang onto the pawn on d5. i found out afterwards that this has all been played before. in blackburn, jonathan lb (2162) vs. guy, david t (2051) white won following e5 15.	dxe6 e.p.	fxe6 16.	f4	b6 17.	bc4	qd6 18.	e5	qd7 19.	rbd1	bb7 20.	qxd4	qc6 21.	rf2	rad8 22.	qxd8	rxd8 23.	rxd8+	kg7 24.	bb3	qe4 25.	rd1	bd5 26.	bxd5	exd5 27.	rfd2	g5 28.	fxg5	qxe5 29.	rxd5	qe3+ 30.	kh1	a5 31.	r5d3	qf2 32.	rd7+	kg6 33.	r1d6+	kh5 34.	rxh7+	kg4 35.	h3+	kxg5 36.	h4+	kg4 37.	rg6+	my opponent tries another way, which i think is inferior. i wasn't sure what i would do after 15.	dxe6 e.p. maybe take back with the bishop and give up the b7 pawn. either way i wasn't happy with my position.   he tries to undermine my pawns in this way. but i can just protect like this. i was very happy with my position now. i thought i was just a clear pawn up. he goes for the big king-side attack which works in some variations of the grünfeld defence but in this case black is secure there. i think he would have been better advised to try and grab the c file before i complete my development. firmly blockading the passed d pawn and also threatening .......e5xf4 in some variations. i think he wants to swing his rook over from b3 to f3 without having to worry about ....bg4 but this is too slow. besides, 17. rf3 bg4 can be met with 18. f4xe5 and black has to recapture with the queen and the black d4 pawn is not looking so secure. preparing to develop the bc8. he carries out his plan. i like this move, keeping an eye on the king-side with the bishop and maybe going to a4 in some variations. fritz prefers bb7. maybe hoping for a discovered check with d5-d6 sometime? stopping that, and also stopping the white queen from coming to h6. trebling on the f file! putting the question to the bishop. bishop drops back. i start to take control of the c file. he is still dreaming of something on the king-side. making sure his a2 pawn cannot advance. my rook comes in. he gives his bishop more support. my other rook swings over. this is a blunder in an inferior position. black has an overwhelming advantage now. best, but the position remains hopeless. ooch! one last desperate effort. i take with check. he takes back. i take back. after a think he realised it is lost and resigned. many thanks for reading. please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a message or two to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
in this game black plays passively and pays the price. immediately before the game i had demonstrated my win against david jameson. i was wondering how long he would repeat moves for! http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/colwyn-bay-v-malpas-oswestry-chester-league?gm=62100 this is different! jameson had taken on c4 instead. bd6 is very unusual though - it normally goes to e7 or b4 here. my very good friend peter lovatt, when i showed him the game suggested e2-e4 instead of this move. i was glad to see that e2-e4 had not been played in any of the previous games where this position arose. what do you think dear reader? is e2-e4 superior to e2-e3.  so he develops. i decide to exchange - rather than develop my bishop from f1 and then he can gain a tempo with dxc4. another point of course in this position, black can only recapture with a pawn, and not his nf6. if he takes back with the e pawn, as in the game, there is a possibility of a white minority attack. http://www.expert-chess-strategies.com/minority-attack.html another consideration was that with his nb8 already committed to d7, if he takes back with the c pawn, that knight ca't be developed immediately to c6. of course, taking back with the c pawn and his bc8 has problems in developing. i was very surprised that in none of the games on gameknot, on the gameknot database, was 8. cxd5 played, although ti was played in some of the games on the world databse he took back this way. preventing his knight coming to e4 in some variations, and preparing to castle. he castles. i castle. he puts his rf8 onto its most logical square, controlling the semi-open e file. in chess, a half-open file (or semi-open file) is a file with only pawns of one color. the half-open file can provide a line of attack for a player's rook or queen. a half-open file is exploited by the player with no pawns on it. i get my rooks connected and add another piece to the key square e4. he move the knight to prepare the development of his bc8. i change my mind about an immediate minority attack. i am planning nd2 followed by f3 and e4 to expand in the centre. rather an acknowledgement that his bishop would have been better developed to e7 in the first place. i tend to think that this move is a waste of a tempo and it would have been better for him to develop his bc8. this is the logical reply, putting the knight on an aggressive square. black is seeking to ease the pressure with exchanges, but the knight is rather out on a limb here. after 13. ne5 i can only find one game in my opening databases with this position, http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=20476007&mv=24&rnd=0.006532949289570045 colo1889 (1907) vs. john_wr (1871). i have actually met john face to face! anyway he chose be6 instead, and i think that move is better. incidentally gameknot post-game computer analysis doesn't give be6 as a mistake, suggesting it was a reasonable move, maybe even the best. i was also looking at ng4 for him, with a similar idea of exchanging pieces. so i take his bishop. but really i am getting rid of his good bishop and my bad bishop. i was rather expecting him to recapture with his queen. so i anchor my knight to e5.  he prepares to exchange my knight. and the long-awaited minority attack starts. he continues with his plan. and me with mine. he takes. i take back. finally the bishop comes out. i take. i can't help thinking that although white has a slight edge anyway, it would have been better to take back with the bishop. heading for c5 not quite sure of the point of this move. knight hops in. he challenges my knight. i grab the open file. he takes. i take back, attacking h7. again, very passive! be6 looks better. of course, he would love to play rb8, but it just loses a rook - i exchange rooks and then take his rook on e7. so he moves it here instead. preparing to double rooks on the b file and invade on b8. black can't stop this. i also protect e3 just in case he tries to break with f6. he has a plan to exchange queens. i double. he offers an exchange of queens. so the rook finally reaches b8. now if he takes my queen, i have a zwischenzug - i take his bishop with check before recapturing the queen and end up a bishop up. the zwischenzug (german: pronounced [ˈtsvɪʃənˌtsuːk] "intermediate move") is a chess tactic in which a player, instead of playing the expected move (commonly a recapture of the capturer of a piece that the opponent has just captured) first interposes another move, posing an immediate threat that the opponent must answer, then plays the expected move. this is a good example.  but now he really is threatening to exchange queens. so i threaten to invade on h7. he prevents this. and now i have a pin on the f file, so i am threatening qxg6. in chess, a pin is a situation brought on by an attacking piece in which a defending piece cannot move without exposing a more valuable defending piece on its other side to capture by the attacking piece. "to pin" refers to the action of the attacking piece inducing the pin, and the defending piece so restricted is described as pinned. this is a good example. were it was white's move now i could play qxg6 and black can't take my queen with his pawn on f7 as he would be moving into check because of my rf1. so he breaks the pin. more pressure on the f file. more importantly he can't play 30....rd8 neutralising my rook, as i have 31. qf6+ where 31....qxf6 is met by exf6+ and he loses the rd8, 31... kf8 is met by qh8# and kg8 or h7 is met with me exchanging queens and winning the rd8.  so he moves back again. i threaten bxg6 now. queen comes back out to g4, but i think kg7 prolongs the game more. i attack the queen. queen wants to keep on the g pawn. ok, stop and find white's best move. did you find it? the threat of qh8 followed by qxbe8 mate is irresistible. http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=181618  many thanks for reading. please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
before this game, i had played him once before and lost. https://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/just-one-slight-mistake?gm=57599 i reply with a grunfeld defence again. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence he played the exchange variation again. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence#exchange_variation:_4.cxd5_nxd5_5.e4 i take back. he takes the centre. i take. he takes. i develop. he plays the old main line. for decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with bc4 and ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. it was generally thought that an early nf3 was weak in the exchange variation because it allowed black too much pressure on the centre with ...bg4. in the late 1970s, however, karpov, kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange variation with white, often involving an early rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of black's queenside. another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing be3, qd2, and rc1 or rd1 to fortify white's centre, remove white's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by white. i strike at the centre. he protects the centre again. i attack d4 again. he protects it. in our last game we continued with the old main line -  0-0 10.0-0 bg4 11.f3 na5 12.bxf7+  rxf7 13. fxg4 rxf1+ 14. kxf1 and i got a reasonable position, but eventually lost. i decided to try something else. i took he took back. i threw in a check. and this was the real surprise! 11. bd2 or qd2 is normal. one possible continuation is the old trap 13. bd2 qa3 14. rb1 o-o 15. d5 ne5 16. bb4 qf3! and white can't take the queen as mate in 2 follows. i decide to castle. clearly the best and most played move here. white decides to move his king out of the way to allow the rh1 to enter the game along the back rank. i was rather more worried about plans involving h2-h4-h5 maybe combined with qd8-c1 and be3-h6. however black should be ok if he or she counters aggressively. logical development. vershinin, igor (2229) vs. rakhmanov, alexander (2110) ended in a draw after  13.	qb3	nxd4 14.	bxd4	bxd4 15.	rd1	bf6 16.	bxf7+	kg7 17.	rxd8	qxd8 18.	kf2	qb6+ 19.	qxb6	axb6 20.	bb3	bd7 21.	nf4	bd4+ 22.	ke2	e5 23.	ne6+	bxe6 24.	bxe6	kf6 25.	bc4	 white continues with his plan. gaining space on the queen-side. fritz likes this move. attacks the knight. fritz prefers bb7, but i think it is much the same. attacks the bishop again. i complete my mobilisation - all my main pieces have moved to logical squares. white is actually behind in development, as he has wasted time with his king. attacking f7 defending against that threat and attacking his bishop. he takes. now which way would you take back dear reader? of course! this is better. if i take with the rook, he simply exchanges rooks on c6 and then brings his remaining rook to c1 with a gain of tempo, as it would be attacking my bc6. he completes his mobilisation. with the nasty threat of ba4. which he defends against of course. bishop comes in anyway. queen retreats. i thought this was good, but fritz seems to prefer rxc1 or bb5 or a6. fritz here likes 21.....rxc8 22. qxc8 exd5 23. exd5 rxd5 24. bxa7 with an edge to black. i tried something else. this! fritz prefers 22. nxc3 with equality. i take. he now takes. i take. he takes. i take. his rook on d3 is attacked and if 25. rd3xc3? rxc3 26 rxc3 d4 wins for black. so this is more or less forced. i take he takes. i move the a pawn to a safer square. black has a very slight edge. he attacks the pawn forced. he tries to restrict my king. so the king comes round here. i am not sure if he was trying to gain space or just exchange pawns. i continue my king march. and he centralises his.  mine also. i wasn't sure why he played this, perhaps to stop my king march up the board. this move is considered by fritz, but fritz thinks that even stronger is 31. f6 and if 36. bxf6 kd6 and white's d pawn goes. black's advantage has increased. protecting his bishop so if i take on d5 he takes on c2 protecting the pawn, so i really am threatening to take on d5 now. so king comes up to protect. with a threat of 34....rb1 winning. so that 34...rb1 can be met with bf4 protecting his rook. but now he loses a pawn. his king strolls up.  and the pawn goes. he takes - now which way would you take back dear reader? i took this way, so that my f pawn is passed. fritz actually prefers taking back with the f pawn, when fritz thinks black is over a pawn and a half ahead. bishop eyes the vital queening square on c1. fritz thinks it is a mistake. i attack the bishop. bishop moves. charge! i thought he was aiming for rc1-e1 followed by rd7+ and a few checks. i decided to stop that, although fritz likes f4 here. but i played this. and now he "threatens" a rook check on g7. fritz thinks this is a mistake. so my pawns advances again. his bishop again eyes the c1 square. i decided to take control of the queening square of my f pawn. fritz prefers 41...f3 he throws in a check, another mistake according to fritz. king drops back. preventing my f pawn from advancing. fritz again doesn't like it! of course! staying near his advanced pawn. fritz puts black more than 3 points up now. another check forced! check again. ending the checks. threatening to take the pawn with check. the obvious move, and very good. fritz puts black as nearly plus 8 now. he attacks the rook. what would you do dear reader? i manage to find a dreadful move, turning a completely won game to a completely lost game! fritz says 48...rf6+ and black is plus 12.63 of course! now ke8 50. rg1 leads to mate, so there is only one other move. now 50. bxg7+ and white is 7.03 up. but thankfully he didn't take it. now, unbelievably fritz gives the position as completely level! that's what the  players thought anyway, as white played 51. rg3 and offered a draw, which i immediately accepted. 
-------------------------------------
this is fascinating. black played the thematic exchange sacrifice on c3. the question is - was the exchange sound, or could white have refuted it? it starts as a sicilian defence. white plays the open variation.  all this has been played many times before. this is the open variation. black takes. white takes back. black attacks e4 white defends.  najdorf variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_defence,_najdorf_variation this is the main line. also common are 1. english attack: 6.be3 2. fischer–sozin attack: 6.bc4 3.	classical/opocensky variation: 6.be2 4.	amsterdam variation: 6.f4 5.	the adams attack: 6.h3 6.....h6 is highly unusual. 6....e6, is by far the most common move and 6.....nbd7 and 6.....nc6 are played. white's first mistake. white places too much faith in his bishop. he should take the chance to  double black's pawns. white choses an agressive square for his bishop. black blunts the bishop and we transpose back into normal positions. the bishop drops back. 0-0 is normally played in this position, but that is coming soon. black develops. this bishop drops back too. i am not sure of the white plan. black castles. so does white, but i would have been tempted to move the queen and play 0-0-0. a fairly thematic sicilian move. this move is often played too. black continues to develop. this is thematic. normal development. fritz prefers 14. e5 another thematic move, although fritz prefers qb6 and surprisingly g6. white takes. rook takes back. white develops. fritz agrees this is best. attacking d4 and b2. fritz agrees this is best. knight drops back. fritz agrees this is best. so here it is, the bold exchange sacrifice. it is not what fritz would play. i wouldn't play it either. i have played this sort of sacrifice, but i would want at least a pawn in return. having said that it is pretty thematic and white has no open files for his rooks. white correctly takes back this way, in order to keep his e pawn. fritz now gives the position as equal, but before the exchange sacrifice it was given as advantage to black. attacking e4. fritz agrees this is best. white protects e4. fritz agrees this is best. the logical square for this rook, but fritz prefers d5. white centralises his knight. fritz agrees this is best. fritz prefers nxe4 21.	rxe4	bxe4 22.	qxe4	rxc3. black attacks c2, although at the moment it is protected by nd4. threatening to exchange on e6 and then play nxe6. fritz pefers rb1 or bh4. fritz agrees that this is best. fritz agrees that this is best, in fact it is the only move to save the knight and the pawn on c2. black renews his attacks on e4. seems likea good idea to me. fritz prefers ne8 or nd7. not sure why. white attacks the black queen. fritz agrees that this is best. white decides to attack on the kingside. fritz prefers c4 or nd2. fritz doesn't like this move either, preferring bb5 or b5. fritz agrees that this is best. to me this is a logical move, but fritz prefers ng4 or b5. a defensive move. fritz now gives this as the second best move, preferring b5. white continues to put great faith in his bishop. fritz likes re2. this is why moving the bishop was wrong. black now has the advantage. better re2 staying protecting e4. fritz prefers bg5 or bd8. fritz agrees that this is best. fritz agrees that this is best. fritz agrees that this is best. now that the doubled pawn is going to be exchanged, fritz says it is equal again. black avoids undoubling the white pawns, but fritz doesn't like this move. fritz gives just taking on d5 as best, but this as the second best move. it thinks white is better now. the bishop was attacked.  fritz actually likes the piece sacrifice here - 31.... d4 32. nxh4 bxe4 with attacks on pawns on c5 and c2. fritz puts white 1.56 up now. fritz agrees that this is best. threatening pawn fork. fritz prefers exd5. fritz agrees that this is best. this looks good as it forks bishop and knight. fritz doesn't like this move. steve gives himself an exclamation mark for this move,but fritz thinks the best move is bxg5 and 2nd best is bxe4. the natural capture, but fritz prefers qg4 as best, followed by kh2. of course the bishop is safe as nf3 is pinned. fritz agrees that this is best. steve gives this move 36.bh2?! but i'd be tempted just to give it a question mark. fritz gives 36. kh2 as best, followed by bf2. steve correctly gives himself an exclamation mark, and quite rightly! fritz agrees it is the best move. fritz doesn't like this move either. fritz agrees it is the best move. the pendulum has swung in black's favour now. white's king seems to be on a suicide mission into the centre and to his doom. fritz prefers 38. kh3. fritz agrees it is the best move, and gives it as  +1.66 for black. white continues with his plan of walking into trouble! the king should have gone back to the g file. fritz agrees it is the best move. +2.56 now. bf1 trying to exchange a powerful attacking piece was better. even better were the simple moves e4 or qxc2. it is becoming a bit academic now, but both nd2 and c3 were better. simple and strong, but be4 or be8 were even better. white takes. black takes back. white takes. the knight goes. fritz agrees it is the best move. fritz says it is mate in 15. white tries to take control of the d file. fritz agrees it is the best move. it is mate in 11. fritz prefers kf2. and now, the end is near and so i face the final curtain kc1 holds out slightly longer. many thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it. please leave a comment or two and mark it with the star system, to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader, and i'll leave the last words to steve. "0-1 white resigned. it's mate!!!!!!!!!! well very soon lol!!!!!!!!" 
-------------------------------------
so it starts as a sicilian https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_defence and we reach the usual position in the open sicilian. he plays the richter–rauzer attack, probably the strongest continuation, and at the moment the most popular. we both follow the most usual continuation for a few moves. he prepares to castle. this is normal. he castles. i prepare to advance my b pawn. this is usual, giving more support to e4, although 9. f4 is even more common. i continue with my queen-side operations. i think this is a bit of a wild thrust on the king-side, although it has been played before. so i continue to develop. although the position after 10.....be7 is on my opening databases, i can't find this queen move on them. presumably the idea is throwing the queen over to the king-side to support a pawn advance there. i don't think it turns out particularly well for white. so i hit his bishop. bishop retreats. i exchange he takes back. i hit the bishop. bishop drops back. played with the idea of preventing him permanently occupying d5 with a piece. if he plays nd5 i can take it. he can't take back with the rook, so he has to take with the pawn and then my weakness on d6 is shielded by his pawn on d5. they is also the chance of an attack on a2. i'm quite happy with this position for black. so he gives some more protection to a2 and my queen comes out to add to pressure on a2 he just develops. this is a thematic exchange sacrifice. in return for the exchange, black gets the a pawn and i shatter his queen side pawns. i have enough compensation, but not more. i was also motivated because nothing else seemed very good, for instance if instead 16......d5? then 17. nxd5 and if qxe1 18. nxf6 check and white ends up a pawn up. in the same way, if 16..... 0-0 then 17. nd5! again is powerful. this is the best way to take. so i take the pawn with check. his king moves back towards the centre. so i take her queen and break up his pawns. he takes back. i have to retreat my bishop, before it is trapped in with c3-c4. this is a good, centralised place for his king. i finally castle. i did consider kd7, but i thought i may need d7 to manoeuvre my knight and/or bishop.  he decides to place his rooks on the a and b files. however i did wonder if rb1 may be stronger. so i bring my rook over. he takes over the b file also. i protect b7. attention now switches to the king-side. i discover an attack on h4 he pushes. i try and keep the king-side closed. i also leave his a4 pawn as a possible target. he prepares to double on the b file my knight is heading to g6 to attack h4. he threatens f4-f5 so my reply is virtually forced. i take. i hit his bishop and h4. so his bishop retreats. i keep up my attack on the king-side. i threaten to take twice on g5. if he takes, i take back with my bishop, attacking c3. but he counter-attacks d6. so i block his bishop attack. he takes the knight. if i take with the other pawn, my bishop on d6 goes. he attacks b7 again. i protect it. i think around here i offered a draw, which he declined. he hits h5 so i protect. i thought this was a bad idea, putting another pawn on the same colour as his bishop - it restricts it somewhat. i give extra protection to g6. not sure of the point of this move, i think he just wanted to reach the time control of move 35. i have a plan to boot out his rook on b6. he moves his king up. i hit his rook. it retreats. i keep the pressure on the c file. his bishop drops back. my rook moves up. he hits the d pawn. i protect it. he moves back. bishop moves back. king moves across. i thought i was securing my queen-side. i saw this after i had moved! i calculated that if i take it, he also wins the d pawn and has an advantage in the ending, while if i don't take it, he still has problems penetrating on the queen-side - or anywhere else. i was dozy for allowing this move, i should of considered it. i put it down to complacency, and i knew at this stage i only had to draw and i had convinced myself that this position was drawn, and i let my guard down. i am very lucky that the position is still drawn, but at least i made the right choice in not taking the rook. so i just protect d6. he moves his king across. i move my king over. he moves his bishop - i think he should have retreated his rook. so i take it. he takes back. i protect the d pawn. rook retreats. passed pawns must be pushed! so his rook comes over. i get ready to protect g6 with nf7, if his rook comes to f6. so he tries on this side again. and my bishop stops it. he offers an exchange of rooks. i encourage it. he takes. i take back. king comes over. so does mine. he opens up another square for his bishop. my king comes across. his goes across again. my king comes up. he threatens ba4 but this attack prevents it. so the bishop goes back. my king goes back. we start to repeat. i go up again. and a draw is agreed. a moment later we won on two, and so narrowly won the match.

he starts classically. i opt for the sicilian. he plays the main line. and i do likewise. he goes for the open variation. so i take. he takes back. i hit his e pawn. he protects. this is a very normal position. the richter–rauzer attack (eco codes b60 et seq). the move 6.bg5 was kurt richter's invention, threatening to double black's pawns after bxf6 and forestalling the dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable. i prevent him doubling my pawns. this is usual development for white. vsevolod rauzer introduced the modern plan of qd2 and 0-0-0 in the 1930s.  usual again, preventing a white knight from coming to b5 and also preparing b7-b5. he continues with his plan. protecting nc6, so preparing b7-b5. this is an interesting move. if now be7 10. bxf6 and if i take back with the bishop my pawn on d6 falls. so i decided to continue with my queen-side play. i am now threatening b5-b4 and after nc3 moves, i can play nf6xe4 and if he plays bg5xqd8 then i have ne4xqd2. so he protects against that threat. now one of my team mates said he thought f3 was a bit passive, but in fact accoridng to my on-line opening databases, it is the most popular move in this position. 10.... rc8 doesn't seem to be in my opening databases, but it seems to me to be a fairly logical follow-up to my previous play. this was also criticised by my team mate as being too passive, but this sort of move is often played in this variation. i attack f3. now this move i think is a mistake. my knight now gets into c4 and it seems very powerful there. perhaps be2 was better. now if 13.	bxf6	bxf6 14. qxd6 nc4, attacking his queen on d6, and after it moves, i have 15....nxb2 and if 16. kxb2 i have bxc3 check so he carries on with his pawn of advancing his king side pawns. my play on the queen-side seems more dangerous. i hit his queen. queen moves. i am now threatening to take on b2 and then on c3. if he protects c3 with 15. bd2, then i have b4 16. nb1	nxb2 17.	kxb2	qxc2+ 18.	ka1	nxg4 and if he takes my knight then be7-f6 check is killing.  so he protects c3 another way. but now his knight comes under fire. knight retreats. with horrible threats.... white finds the best defence, but it drops rook for knight and pawn. with threats to the rook. he takes the bishop. i take the rook with check. he takes. i take the knight. he takes the pawn with check. i was tempted to offer the exchange of queens, as i am materially ahead, but i figured his king was still vulnerable with the queens on. i am threatening mate on c2. so he protects. i take the bishop. i thought taking back with the pawn was best, with pressure down the half-open h file, but i think this position is still better for black. but he took back this way. and i eventually castle. he develops his rook. i hit his a pawn. he advances again on the king-side. i like this move, renewing the possible threat on c2 again - so his ne3 can't move. he advances again. i drive the queen back. she retreats. i hit it again. queen retreats again. and i finally gets round to taking the a pawn. bishop comes round to a better diagonal.  i stop his bishop coming to c4. another king-side pawn advance, but what else can he do? i stop any counter-play down the g file. he takes. i take back. he is still hopeful of something on the king-side. threatening to take on c2. he tries to stop by queen-side play. stop! what do you think black plays now? did you find this dear reader? so he takes. i take back. knight comes in. white is lost now. can you find the mate in 5 from here? http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=158556 did you find this move? forced! and, as there is no satisfactory, long-term defence against ra8-a1, white resigned. many thanks for reading! please leave a comment or two and rate it on the start system. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
this was a very lucky win. he comes up with a winning combination, but at a crucial moment, he quickly makes an instinctive capture. this turns out to be a mistake. i end up with two queens, trying to avoid a perpetual check, which i do. the question is - could he have played the final position better - could he have got a perpetual? please let me know your thoughts dear reader! so once again, he plays the king's indian defence, and i play the sämisch variation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence,_s%c3%a4misch_variation he continues with the main line. i close the centre. this is common too, preparing f7-f5 and/or nf4. this is a mistake. next time i will stick to the main line and play qd1-d2 knight comes in, also hitting g2 so i protect g2. this threatens nxg2 again, but i am not sure it is correct. on the gameknot opening databases nxd3 and f7-f5 have been tried. now taking on g2 with his knight, just loses a bishop. ok, stop and see if you can find white's next move? did you find it? the point is that white now has he threat of g2-g3. i did toy with the idea of kb1 or bc2 with the same threat. i will tell you after the next move, why i played bf1 instead, but first now find black's next move! did you find it? the only other defence g5 runs into 12.g3	ng6 13. h4	f6 14.	nh3 and black is losing a pawn. if instead on 11. bf1 i had played kb1, then black could have played nd-c5 with tempo first, attacking my bd3. after i see to that threat, the final nh3 is less strong as he can meet nh3 with bc8xh3. in the same way, if i had retreated my bishop to c2, he could have played nb6 with tempo, as it attacks my pawn on c4, and again his bc8 can capture on h3. i only considered taking on f4 very briefly. it is a usual pawn sacrifice in the king's indian. white would give up his best minor piece, his dark squared bishop and black is ready to exploit the weak black squares. the position is so much easier to play for black. after 12. bxf4 exf4 13.	qxf4	f5, his knight has lovely squares on c5, e5 or f6. so his knight drops back. i develop again. the usual break is made. i develop. he hits d3 i retreat. he takes. this is played with a view of getting my other knight to c3. this was a bit of a surprise so i take his knight. he takes back. i recapture my pawn. he hits my bishop. i decided to try and gain a tempo by hitting his rook. he next move was a complete surprise to me, but it should have won him the game! this is the surprise! i take his rook. stop and find his next move please. he hits my bishop. i protect i didn't see this move. this is why qf8 is played rather than qf6. did you spot qf8. now there is only one move to save my queen. and this is it! he played this quickly. it is the natural move to play. you normally should take with the weakest piece first. it is a massive mistake! after the game, my opponent stopped that nxf4!! instead is much stronger. analysing later with a friend, david thomas, we found lines like nxf4 23. kb1 bf5+ 24. ka1 ne6 25. qe1 nd4 26. qxe5 nc2+ 27. kb1 bg7 28.qxc7 rb8, winning for black. ok, stop and find white's next move. did you find it? the point is that fxg3 is met by bd5+ and white wins. rb8 is met with d7 which wins a bishop as if he moves his bishop to b7 or a6, i play d7-d8=q and wins. so what did he play? i think this is his best move, as the knight covers d5 and d7 and fxg3 is threatened again. so i have to take this pawn. i think this is a mistake and simply rb8 may be ok for him. i take he takes. i did consider playing bd5+ here, which is also strong, but what i played was good enough. i took. he takes back. and now this pawn is queening. kf7 may be an improvement, so that after i queen, i am not threatening mate. also it takes the e7 square away from me. so i play queen in. his queen comes in. i get a second queen. he checks. there is only one square now which doesn't lose the rook with check. so i played king to this square. the question is - what happens now after bxf4+ - has he got a perpetual check or not? after the game with luke, we found ways out of the checks, but looking at it later with david thomas, we were unable to find ways out. what do you think dear reader? has anyone time to run this game through a computer and find out if white is winning in this position? anyway, he checked here instead. and now he resigned, as after qa4 check, b3 and he has run out of checks and i am threatening my own mate. please rate this game on the star system and leave a comment or two. i hope you enjoyed this game! 
-------------------------------------
so he starts conventionally i play the sicilian he develops his knight, preparing d2-d4 and i develop mine. he pushes i take he takes back i hit his e pawn he protects it. i prevent him from playing nd4xnc6 followed by e4-e5. this is really the parting of the way next. he can play  6.bc4, called "sozin" (eco code b57). it brings the bishop to an aggressive square, or 6.bg5, the richter–rauzer attack (eco codes b60 et seq). the move 6.bg5 was kurt richter's invention, threatening to double black's pawns after bxf6 and forestalling the dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable. he plays the thrid most popular move at this point. quite playable, but perhaps less agreesive that the previously mentioned moves. this is the boleslavsky variation, named after isaac boleslavsky. black gets a foothold in the centre, but has a backward d pawn on a semi-open file. both sides have chances. this is the old move, which used to be considered the "main line". now nf3 is more common. so i develop. he castles i castle. he develops. now i have had this position before. see http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/hagley-v-kidderminster?gm=44180
-------------------------------------
the sicilian defense.  black is looking to create an unbalanced position from his first move. this is a different take on the sicilian than normal.  white looks to play 3. d4 and have a two-pawn center (pawns on d4 and e4). a center-counter-like line to draw the black queen to the center of the board.  white, however, cannot effectively drive the queen away, as nc3 is prevented by a white pawn occupying that square. may open a discovered attack on the black queen by dxc5. pins the knight on f3 to the queen. removes the pin and allows for a discovered attack on the bishop. attempts to drive the bishop off of g4. moves to safety while keeping what control he has over the d1-h5 diagonal. all moves that precede this as well as this are book moves: the sicilian defense / alapin variation (b20).  it seems that this opening starts both sides' attacks geared toward the kingside.  (book source: chessmaster xi) out of book (book source: chessmaster xi).  this move looks to control space deep in white's camp; however, white can play 11. a3 to drive that bishop off the square.  chessmaster's annotation suggests be7, simply opening up for the kingside castle (which this move does), and leading to 11. nc3 qd6.  personally, i would play bd6, challenging some of white's kingside control. one other thing that this move does: it forces deep blue to begin calculations, as it is not in the computer's opening book. now kasparov finds himself on defense. again, black continues to contest squares deep in the white camp. now the two white knights are advancing on black too. both sides are looking to take control of the open c-file. white is out of bishops but has his knights advanced. black looks to control the d-file as well as the c-file. the competitors are after 3 files: the c-, d-, and e-files.  white controls more territory on these three files, so he has the edge. concedes the e-file but stares intimidatingly at the d4 pawn. white gets the pawn out of the queen's and knight's lines of sight.  exd5 here would be a big mistake. black wins the pawn and a rook for a rook, and a passed pawn on d5; however, now the white queen can move all over the e-file. moves the king back in order to make it seem less exposed.  opens a new line on the g-file for black's rook. putting a chokehold on the c-file. pushing the passed pawn, but it still looks doomed. a move that would often be overlooked in favor of more offensive moves.  this demonstrates the big difference in the way humans and computers think.  humans typically evaluate moves that fit in with their overall strategy and current plan, while computers evaluate all moves.  deep blue "sees" that kasparov is attacking but really does not care because there is no real threat.  many humans would see black's attack and think that they were in deep s***. keeps pushing his pieces toward the kingside in order to continue the attack. exploits the pin on the pawn on g2. halts the pawn advance. right to the seventh rank, and now black is in some trouble. there's an attack, but the silicon monster that is deep blue calculates that this is a less-than-legitimate threat. forced.  now the white king is trapped; however, black's king is wide open. threatens rh1 and mate.  but white will exploit the open position of black's king to render this threat moot. "also futile is 35...qxf7 36. qd8+ kg7 (or 36...re8 37. qxd4+) 37. rxf7+ kxf7 38. qd5+ kg6 39. qxf3 d3 40. qxf2 re2 41. kg2" (chessmaster).  and the harassment of black's king begins.  black has run out of good moves.  out of three legal moves, all of them lead to continued harassment of the king and an eventual removal of the mate threat. kasparov has two options here: move the king to g6 or raise the proverbial white flag.  he chooses the latter. kasparov describes chess as "a fight of two intellects, two egos, two wills."  he informs us "[w]hen playing a computer suddenly you don’t have an opponent, you have an operator in front of you who just moves the pieces. it’s a kind of wall, you know. it’s a face, but the person represents virtually nothing to you." this game's impact on chess is undeniable; we have seen that computers can play sound chess.  they do not play like humans, but we can gain new insight on chess by examining the calculations that computers make. i believe that, no matter how strong computers get, humans will not be far behind them for this reason. 
-------------------------------------
ruy lopez common line marshall attack (thematic game). modern variation, common line not the common line any longer. usual move in a marshall attack. attacking the rook classical move  to contest the open file bocking the e file developping and preparing an attack on the queen side developping and joining the rooks white will have to face a strong queenside attack, very uncommon in the marshall attack (black usually attak the king side by playin qh4. so that i make my plan : attacking on the kingside. now everybody in white's uniform is aiming at the black king. black's pawn advance is dangerous. white's attack on the king had better be strong and quick first, slowdown black on the queenside "a pawn is a pawn" like my mighty opponent says but this attack doesn't seem too serious, material is now equal and the knight has little immediate menace available (at least, it seemed so). so that white launches the counterattack. i thought that against such a powerfull opponent, i should take the initiative. if i let elohim play his game, i can, at best oppose a long resistance but i'm doomed. so that dame guenièvre is paying a little visit, knocking at the black king's castle only move, foreigners are not welcomed under the castle walls now, white's idea was to carry on with dsb and knight on f3. alas ! i had overlooked this simple move. fearing the black archery, dame guenièvre has to retreat in her domain, not even choosing the square. if 21. qg5 qxg5 22. bxg5 bg4 with menace on e2 from both knight and bishop the evil black knight harasses the poor dame guenièvre ... who has only one proper place to go. now black controls about two third of the board, are better on the center which is still contested by white and has a strong and dangerous soldier on a3, in ambush for the endgame. i thought i had now to block black on the queenside, menacing c6 the d knight has loss his protection against black's dsb menace. things begin to look really bad for white. only way to carry on protecting the faithfull lancelot, dame guenièvre's presence is giving him courage in the battle. carrying on the pressing weakening the white king but i couldn't find any better move. pressing white's central bishop. black has to be quite sure of himself, probably seeing a precise tactic because this move seriously weakens the black king. one's more, i couldn't find any better move. atleast, i preserve the material equality only move to save the queen and protect lancelot and d4, white's isolated pawn. dame guenièvre, in the middle of the battlefield, rally all her faithfull servants attacking the weak and essential d4 pawn. to escape the mortal fork attack qxd4+ and the a rook meets its doom. anyway, the brave d4 soldier is unproctable and ready to lay down his life for his queen. aargh ! nothing else to do black has now a passed pawn. i could have submited here but i thought there could be more to learn, studying elyhim's tactic. exchanges are not good for white but that was the only way to avoid 30. nd2 or 30. nxe1 which would have been even worse ! the second time in this game that black has a forced move to play (white had at least six). almost forced (31. nb1 would have let the king protected only by the pawn and lancelot would have been blocked in the corner) only two more steps  blocking the d pawn and setting the rook on a dark square unavoidable forced move ! what else ? lancelot is still guarding the castle gate but the brave knight is doomed providing an escape to the king now black has material advantage. to menace the a2 pawn. ... which white cannot defend. the only way is a stronger menace black has plenty of place to escape. a pawn is a pawn. white has only one move. if 39. kh1 rf1+mate a new passed pawn for black harassing the bishop another forced move for white to avoid the mate ... but not the check. the poor king arthur is under a close siege in his castle, under the weak protection of his last henchmen. preventing 43. ra7 arthur goes for a little walk (so long he still can) only move to delay the mate only one move available for white white submits here. thank you elyhim for this lesson. the queenside developpement in the marshall gambit is uncommon and an interresting alternative to the traditionnal attack (as long as i can judge).

 b) permite colocar uma torre defendida em e5... a ordem dos lances é importante, primeiro f3... pressiona d6... defende d6... tenta ganhar mais espaço... finalmente, torre em e5, bem defendida, e pressionando constantemente o peão em e4... defende e4... reforça a ameça em e4, ao mesmo tempo em que prepara o avanço do peão em d6, totalmente inesperado pelas brancas... o peão em d4 não pode ser tomado, e se tornará um peão passado... peão passado em d5! e agora a questão, como defendê-lo e trocar as peças para valorizar sua posição vencedora? a torre em c8 está pregada, e não consegue invadir a posição das negras! oferece a troca do primeira torre... de acordo com a estratégia adotada... evita que a torre branca se infiltre por tras das linhas negras... reduz o espaço das brancas... traz o rei branco para o centro, prevendo um final puro de reis e peões... também procura centralizar... procura abrir a posição... apodera-se da coluna aberta... troca a segunda torre, mesmo perdendo o peão em a6... tanto as brancas quanto as negras ficarão com os reis expostos, mas o primeiro xeque será das negras, e essa diferença decidirá a partida... as negras tomam o peão central branco, já prevendo que:
-------------------------------------
 a) se as brancas tentarem dar xeque no rei negro, a única casa segura é h7, desde que evitem o xeque perpétuo por parte das brancas dg6 <-> de8, o que é feito colocando a dama na coluna "e"
-------------------------------------
 b) o peão negro vai ser promovido em d8 antes do peão branco em a1... belo xeque, que ganha um tempo para as brancas... rei protegido... perde um tempo precioso para o avanço do peão branco da coluna "a" descrava o peão... avança para a vitória... tenta segurar... acabou... as brancas desistem... 
-------------------------------------
uma partida interessante, que ilustra uma variante arriscada da defesa dos dois cavalos... defesa dos dois cavalos variante clássica... esta é a variante... neste momento, as negras podem optar por sacrificar a torre, em troca de maior desenvolvimento e um eventual ataque. a variante clássica padrão preve o recuo do bispo branco para e2, ao invés do lance de dama das brancas... eis o segredo da variante, o bloqueio da dama branca... ganha um tempo... coloca o rei em segurança e a torre negra em jogo... ataca a dama, que fica praticamente sem casas... 13. qa8 é arriscado, e meu adversário opta por 13. qc6 ...  defende o bispo negro ao mesmo tempo que ataca o cavalo branco! além disso, prepara uma armadilha para a dama branca com bb2! a dama branca está perdida... busca se livrar do peão isolado... ataca f2... defende... defende o peão em e5, liberando a torre negra para o jogo... ataca d3... defende d3... centraliza o cavalo negro... protege o bispo, que continuará atuando na agressiva diagonal a7-f2, ao mesmo tempo permite que a torre negra possa ser jogada com tranquilidade em b8... opta por atacar outro ponto fraco: c3 ... defende c3... ataca novamente d3... defende d3... defende o ponto b7 novamente... evitando o risco de um ataque das torres brancas dobradas... erro que custa a partida, pois permite a entrada dos cavalos negros e do bispo negro em d4... coloca a dama em uma diagonal mais agressiva, já que a mesma foi bloqueada no lance anterior por c4... defende d4... ataca d4... defende d4... toma d4, na força bruta, o que leva a uma vantajosa troca de peças para as negras, que tem vantagem de dama para o final do jogo... ataca a2... defende... procura destruir o que sobrou dos peões brancos, isolando-os... as torres brancas ficam isoladas uma da outra... ataca torre e bispo ao mesmo tempo... salvou a torre, mas o bispo... o erro definitivo... as brancas abandonam, pois poderia seguir 40. kh1 rxa3, que colocaria as brancas em grande dificuldade.... 
-------------------------------------
i'm practicing playing e6 against the queen's gambit, planning to move into the dutch without having to deal with the staunton gambit or the bg5 opening. and so far, white usually is willing to transpose to a french opening. but i don't know the french, except for the first 3 or 4 moves that i learned from a pbs show on the spassky-fischer match back in the early 70s (and i went to my first tournament ready to play black with that information). so i'm investigating the sicilian in this position -- probably the taimanov variation since that uses e6 instead of d6. and d5 is what i've prepared for as the most difficult drawback to the plan. i can't afford to let him play d6 and lock in my bishop. but this doesn't feel totally unplayable, either. i'll have to deal with a dark-colored bishop that has limited scope at first, but i don't feel at risk. usually i hate to play a3 or h3 before the knight or bishop come to g4 (or b4), but that's probably a good move here. i was planning ng4 to let my bishop out, and i would've looked at moving the knight to e5 if he chased it away with h3 (and my bishop would still be unblocked). so he's not going to trade on d7 and let my knight recapture.  i decided that i'm not so worried about bxa6 and doubling my pawns. they won't be that easy to attack, and i'll use the b-file for my rook. but no sense in just letting the knight sit on the edge forever. so will he use nc3 to get the knight out and protect the pawn, or will he retreat the bishop to c4? the good thing about nc3 for me is that my knight becomes safe from pawns. i'm looking at bf5 to put more pressure on his c-pawn and it gives my pawn on d6 more protection. if he plays nc3, i wonder if i can risk a6 and cut off my knight's retreat and then b5. i haven't looked at that in depth yet, but it looks like to win the pawn on b5 (attacked by the pawn on a4, a knight, and a bishop), i would get the pawn on d5.  lots of possibilities. i figured he'd have to retreat eventually. next, he'll probably head for c7 if i'm willing to cut off my queen from b6. i think he's moving the bishop out of the way so he can play c4 to protect that pawn better. i'm making plans to challenge the pawn on c4 by playing b5. he sure has clamped down on b5. i play qd7 to support b5 if i want to use that at some time. it also lets me sacrifice on h3 if that looks helpful. i have to remember that the q is guarding the b on e7 if he plays re1.  i recognize this as a very defensive position for both of us. i want to start playing to prevent him from getting an edge (more than expecting to find a wonderful tactic). i'll use implodes+k to assess this position. i (initiative) - i've got a little initiative if either of us do, but i don't think i have an edge. m (material) - even p (pawn structure) - probably even. we both have a backward pawn to protect. l (lines) - even. our bishops on f4 and f5 control some lines, and my q is a little more useful in this regard than his. but i expect to see rc2 eventually. whichever of us ends up controlling the e-file gets the big advantage here. i can imagine re8 being my next move. o (officers - knights & bishops) - looks even. we both have a knight and a bishop that are out of play, but i think his knight can get into the game easier than mine. de (development) - even s (space) - white's got the advantage here. king safety - even   looks like white has a slight edge with more opportunities to improve his position than i do. there are really two moves i'd like to make. this is one of them, because i can't move my queen otherwise (i keep looking at bxh3). the other move is b6. in fact, i messed up -- must be getting too late. i had planned on re8, then i started worrying about him playing a5. as it stands, he can't move his knight from a3 because i'm ready to play b5, but if he plays a5 first, then i've got to deal with the en passant threat. that's what i'd decided to move on the analysis board, then i returned to the real board and made the other move. so now i just have to wait and hope he doesn't play a5. i thought of playing b6 last move (to stop a5), but i'd underestimated how dangerous it is. he threatens ba4 to win the exchange, and if i try to block with b5, he takes it en passant with an attack on the knight. and looking at bxh3, it doesn't seem to go anywhere because he can block with bg3  i was worried that he was going to play rxe7, followed by bxd6 and bxc5. maybe i'll have to play ne5 to block it. that's a strong move. the only options i think i have are bd7 (which loses the knight), bxh3 (and i can't get that to work), and rd8 (which i really don't like, but i don't see another choice). again, nothing looks good here. i've got to give up the idea of bxh3 and retreat it to g6. white still has a better position, though, way better placed pieces. i've sure got lots of pieces under attack ... or about to be under attack. looks forced to me. not thrilled with this move but i don't want him to get a knight into the attack on g5 and make my rook retreat, too. (it's not as if my rook has all that many squares to sit on.) gameknot says we're even, but i know that i'm really behind (but not by much). knights and bishops are really worth 3.25 pawns, and a rook is worth 5 pawns. but, positionally, i'm worried about that passed pawn. if i want to blockade it, i'm looking at ne8 and then nd6, except he can play qb4 to prevent it. another move i'm looking at is bf7 so it can have an effect on the center, but i really like that it's protecting the rook for now. my rook on e4 doesn't have a better square to go to, and it threatens to get behind his pawns at some point, and i've got nowhere better at all to put that queen. then there's that rook at b8 which really isn't doing anything there. so let's move it to a better square, either d8 or c8.  so i have to worry about re1 or d6. let's evaluate:   initiative - white's ahead   material  - white's ahead   pawn structure - even (or white's ahead)   lines      - white's ahead (because of his control of the c5-f8 diagonal)   officers  - white's ahead ("officers" refers to whose knights & bishops are better placed)   development - even   space     - white's ahead   king safety - even    so the knight's going to g3 next to fork the rook and the pawn. i can put the rook on e4, but it's not a good position for me, especially after he plays d6. these games are making me feel so tired; i feel like i'm on the wrong end of every game i'm playing. i want to play re1, but after d6, my knight's going to have to go to a8 and never be heard from again. i might as well use it to take out two pawns instead of just banishing it. what? i know i'm playing lots of games all of a sudden, but i just gave away my rook? i said that i got a high rating, for a large part, because i never timed out or made ridiculously stupid moves — and now i've thrown away pieces in two games in a row. sorry, team. 
-------------------------------------
la posición de ruptura intermedia, si las blancas aceptan el cambio de damas caen los peones centrales, si retiran la dama el caballo en g3 va a quedar en el "aire" como se verá mas adelante era mejor a c1, pero las blancas ya están claramente inferior rh2 pierde de inmediato por 18.... cg4+ cazador cazado, el alfil no tiene escape si 24.tf1 c4, 25.d4 cd3, y caen los peones centrales porque el caballo sostiene la torre en g3 no hay defensa mejor era 27.... ae5, 28.f4 txf4 con ganancia de material blancas abandonan 
-------------------------------------
por raro que parezca esta es la última posición en mi base de datos ... esta vez fue tommy el que salió de la teoría por la estructura de peones el alfil blanco de las negras es un peón gordo en este momento, mi caballo en cambio si es valioso ... torre, caballo y alfil del flanco rey todavía guardados ... eso tiene que pagarse en algún lado, como en g6 ... si 14... axc5, 15.bxc5 cc4, 16.0-0 y la columna b queda para las blancas ... es notable el retraso en desarrollo de las negras no la entendí ... tal vez, 15... ah6 esto ya debe ser ventaja decisiva para las blancas ... es como si las blancas jugaran con dos piezas de más ... la columna b es una autopista para las torres momento de decidir hacia donde arrinconar al rey, obvio elegí la columna b abierta para mis torres si ya sé .. no es muy fino que digamos buscando la columna h para mi torre no encontré mate alguno ... para evitar que el caballo negro llegue a b3  
-------------------------------------
alternative variation: 6.c3 [ es la continuación principal. la jugada ensayada en la partida tiene por objetivo llevar el planteo a una formación maroczy, con los peones en las casillas blancas, ahora que el alfil del mismo color ha sido cambiado, las negras no tendrán protección en ellas. ]   ahora me sentí incómod ante la "amenaza" posicional 7..dg4!? doblando los peones en f3, ya que la blancas no quieren tomar el caballo de "e5" por la presión que tendrían las negras por la columna "d". en ese instante me arrepentí de haber jugado esta variante. alternative variation:   alternative variation: 7...qg4 [ era perfectamente jugable, las blancas tienen algo de ventaja de espacio, las negras tendrán mejor rey y la casilla c5 si las blancas insisten en jugar con d4.] 8.nc3 nxf3+ 9.qxf3 qxf3 10.gxf3   asumí que como gabriel no la hizo antes, ahora tampoco jugaría dg4. veía que tendría ciertos problemas con los descubiertos, pero me interesaba más activar mis piezas en torno al posible ataque sobre el flanco de rey por medio de f4-f5. por otro lado, en esta formación de peones, b3 en algún momento se realiza.  alternative variation: 11.ng5 [de conocer las partidas de morozevich la hubiese jugado. era una continuación más directa, acorde al plan comentando antes, que involucra el sacrificio de calidad en una de sus variantes:] 11...n7c6 12.f4 nd4 13.qe3 nc2 14.qh3 nc6 15.f5   ahora las negras tienen la oportunidad  de jugar 15.., f5!? aprovechando la centralización de sus piezas. sin embargo, gabriel apunta hacia la ruptura en d5, la cual es perfectamente lógica, pero débil en la parte práctica, ya que me dará más "cuerda" en el flanco de rey.  apartándome del camino pre concebido. ví que me quedaba con un cómodo juego contra un peón aislado luego de los cambios y el golpe en "d4". pienso que era mejor ser consecuente y jugar 16 f5, por ejemplo: alternative variation: 16.f5 gxf5 17.cxd5 exd5 18.exf5 kh8 19.qh5   debería ser mejor la captura en d4. la posición alcanzada claramente no es lo que buscan las blancas.   ? parece que omití 18.. dd3 del manojo de variantes que estaba revisando antes de jugar el cambio en "d5". en río revuelto las blancas pescarán un peón, ahorrando la posibilidad de atacar con el prometido "f5".  â¡no pierdo la esperanza de jugar f5! sobre todo ahora que la torre dejó la columna "f".   â¡ahí está! por fin, eso sí, estoy sacrificando una calidad al permitir ce3 por parte de las negras, pero el ataque será tan fuerte que estará compensado. en este momento se justifica el cambio de alfiles de casillas negras para debilitar el flanco.  tira pinta por sí misma esta jugada, sin embargo 29.., cd1 pone las cosas en su lugar. de todas maneras, pronto viene ta7 y los peones del flanco de dama serán los verdugos de las negras.   craso error entrando en los apuros de tiempo, gabriel no ve más que el sacrificio de la dama alargando la agonía.   y las negran rindieron.   
-------------------------------------
ahora llega el momento de poner en práctica otra idea. jugar rossolimo para dirigir el planteo hacia una apertura española. en esta caso específico, las negras no jugaron "e5", así que el planteo derivó en una especie de ataque indio de rey.   â¡ahí está! ahora si las negras quieren silenciar al asesino de las casillas blancas, jugarán "e5", derivando el planteo hacia posiciones de la apertura española, en donde uno de los temas principales será aprovechar las casillas blancas "d5" y "f5" respectivamente.  ok, las negras no jugaron "e5", entonces la lucha deriva hacia el ataque indio de rey, en donde la diagonal b1-h7 es un tema de preocupación constante para las negras.   ultra conceptual, sin embargo, toga opina que "c4" es una interesante alternativa. resulta que las piezas negras no están muy bien organizadas en el flanco de dama, tomar en c4 dejará una debilidad en "c5" y no hacerlo permite aprovechar la gran diagonal blanca:  alternative variation: 12.c4 nf4 13.be4 rb8 14.nb3 ng6 15.qc2   preparando al defensor nâº1 del flanco de rey de las negras, el caballo en "f8". la defensa es excelente, pero tiene el precio de atar una pieza.  ok, conseguí sacar al caballo centralizado, pero cómo llevo más piezas al flanco? pasar la torre de "a1" a lo kasparov, por la tercera fila me llevará muchos tiempos. me empezaba a sentir incómodo al no encontrar una continuación claramente fuerte.   las negras escupen su gran alfil para evitarse dolores de cabeza, confiando en los cambios de pieza para aliviar la presión.  el avance de h4-h5 costó un par de valiosos tiempos a las blancas. el flanco de dama se empieza a teñir de negro, las chances prácticas serán del primer jugador.  el fin de la maniobra defensiva de las negras. las blancas deberían estar perdidas...   era mejor 28..., cg6, pero había que tener nervios de acero para aguantar la ofensiva de las blancas mientras el reloj de a poco empieza a influir en la certeza del análisis.  de un vistazo comprendí que necesitaba agregar más debilidades para poder llegar, así que opté por una idea bien compleja y arriesgada, reorganizar las piezas, darle algo de espacio a las negras y aprovechar cuando se expandan. un objetivo en el mediano plazo será el cambio de alfiles de casillas negras y mejorar mi caballo.   ok, las primeras fases se cumplen a cabalidad, las negras avanzan en el flanco y mi caballo ya está de nuevo en el tablero  las negras han caído en la trampa sicológica. era mejor 35.., ch4 obligando a bloquear la diagonal d1-h5, el camino hacia la ventaja de las blancas.  ahora af8 permite ce4, así que las negras se la juegan por acumular riquezas en el flanco opuesto. el resultado será un premio a la tenacidad de las blancas.  se acaban los jaques, la bruma de los cañonazos se esfuma y el rey negro yace completamente acorralado. las negras se rinden.

-------------------------------------
hello! i decided to annotate this game, which was a tough one, actually played against a team mate of mine! the team is yeshua´s army, one of gameknot six christian teams. anyway, i started with 1. d4, i like to play the queens gambit pretty much nowadays. my opponent answered with d5.  c4, the queens gambit move. now is it queens gambit declined, qcd. as far as i have read in the theory books, this move is better than accepting the gambit. just playing standard opening moves. if i was black, i had choosen 7... c4 instead with space advantage! after we both have castled, it´s even. occupying the a1-h8-diagonal with my dsb. for you that don´t know what this shortening means, it´s the dark squared bishop! aiming towards the black king , of course it´s some pieces in the way, but they will sooner or later be removed! after this last exchange, i have the bishop pair and my opponent two knights. according to the chess theory it´s a small advantage! suddenly, i saw that i could exchange my dark squared bishop for one of my opponents knights! furtrhermore that knight was not protected by any piece, only by a pawn. that means that after my opponent has striked back with his g-pawn, it will appear a hole in the pawn shield in the front of his king! to demolish the pawn shield in front of the enemy king is, as far as i know, a greater advantage than the bishop pair. so i gave the bishop pair up, because of this new, greater advantage. so must you think in chess. 17...f5 was a good move, it somehow defends the black king from threats alongside the diagonal b1-h7! trying to replace my pieces in optimal positions. i want to triple on the d-file, with queen and two rooks. furthermore, my light-squared bishop is also aiming against blacks d5-pawn. that means that black will be tied up with the defense of that pawn. finally, i have reached my desired position. but this is not enough, because black can defend properly. now it´s time for me to create a new weakness, according to the theory of the two weaknesses, well known in the chess theory! blacks position is rather passive. now i´m also aiming against blacks f5-pawn. the theory of the two weaknesses! maybe not the most innovative move in the position, but i couldn´t find any stronger! gaining a tempo with threat against blacks queen. is also fixing blacks f5-pawn. material it is even, but maybe i have got a small positional advantage here? but it´s not easy to know how to best proceed from here! ? not a good move, creates another pawn weakness for black! starting to pressure along the d1-h5 diagonal.  the game seems a little bit locked on the kings-side, so therefore i will try to provoke a new pawn weakness for black on the queens-side! the game bears the stamp of slow manuevering, in this stage. maybe the breakthrough, at last? i wins a pawn, thanks to this tactics! i´m aiming at both blacks a- and f-pawns, forcing black to passively defend.  better was b5. a great tactics by black here, if i escape with my bishop here, black will give a check on d4 in the next move and then win my undefended rook on c5 for free! i found that this little sacrifice was the only solution! better than lose a whole rook anyway! now am i quality under.  now it doesn´t looks so fine out for me! i have got a very passive, crampy game and is also a quality under! a  pawn move that opens up the diagonal e1-h4 for a counterattack with my queen. better was to escape with the king to a safer square! now i get a pretty nasty check! he totally missed the checkmate in the next move with qh7#. checkmate! this was a really hard game between two christian team players. have tolerance with me if my comments not is of a very high standard, but i have tried to give my opinions about the game, after my best ability!

petrov's defence (c42) petrov (c42), french attack petrov (c42), french attack petrov (c42), french attack fortfarande petrov (c42), french attack, men det hade varit statistiskt bättre att spela nc6. nu har vit försprånget. petrov (c42), french attack här upphör petrov (c42), french attack, och vit har ett övertag med +1.83. här ligger jag rejält efter i utveckling, och vit har alla initiativ möjliga. det här bondelyftet är endast skenbart bra, för vits t har en effektiv pinne mot min d runt hörnet.  bättre hade varit att parera med s7 till antingen b6 eller f6. vit leder enormt positionellt. mina pjäser är helt låsta, och ingen vettig attack har jag heller.  här kommer pinnen jag nämnde tidigare, och jag måste förlora material för att rädda situationen. räddar d, men ligger risigt till totalt. mitt enda rimliga drag. här hade det varit bättre att avpinna d och flytta henne till d7. min bondestruktur är åt helvete efter detta drag. äntligen. vit leder fortfarande både materiellt och positionellt, men jag slipper åtminstone bekymra mig för k. lite lam attack, men jag var trött på att vara defensiv. behåller kontroll över diagonalen, och inbjuder vit till att luckra upp sin bondestruktur. backar hem hela vägen,och försöker bygga upp något konstruktivt mot vits kungssida. inte världens bästa drag, då vits s nu kan placera sig på e5 och kontrollera mitten. ett lamt drag som endast får mig att förlora l på e6. d till d7 hade varit bättre. där satte vit in stöten, och nu är han på väg att klassa ut mig. försöker sätta lite motkraft, och draget är bra. hans försvar av k hotas en aning, men vit leder givetvis stort ändå. nu har han åtminstone dubbla bönder på f-filen. förhoppningsvis kan det bli en nackdel för vit längre fram. avpinnar k gentemot vits d. bra för mig att han inte utväxlar t på f6. här ligger jag i starkt underläge, och endast chansningar återstår. försöker ta lite material av honom innan han promoverar en bonde. här får jag en oväntad chans till utjämning av spelet. en damgaffel mellan hans l och k borde göra susen. plötsligt är vits enorma övertag på +11.42 reducerat till 0.00, pga detta misstag. bra !! nu vänder vi på steken, och vit är hårt pressad. efter en stunds betraktande och prövande upptäckte jag att svarts l måste slås med d och inte med t. här ligger en matt runt hörnet, men endast om jag slår med d. annars får vit ett stort övertag igen. sådärja, nu gäller det bara att gå ner med t'na sedan och matta. allt närmare matt. ett snyggt slut, och en fantastisk vändning av partiet vid 39:e draget. 
-------------------------------------
black chose the sicilian.  a little bit unusual move in this situation, maybe? castling kingside! putting the question to the bishop! the opening is over, yet the middle game has begun! threatening a fork on blacks rook and queen in the next move! advantage for white! and there comes the fork! generally speaking it´s good to exchange pieces when you are over in material! tripling on the d-file! a free pawn! i have a clear advantage now. is up in material and have two free pawns + free play! winning another pawn through this tactic! changing queens make it easier for me to win! activating the king is important in the most endgames! a positional sacrifice that wins the game for me! it´s hopeless for black now! black resigns!

jätan vaieldamatult pingelise partii esimese poole kommenteerimata, sest põhisündmused algasid esimese ajakontrolli eel. mõlemad vastased olid siiani kulutanud suhteliselt võrdselt aega - kummalgi oli ca 20 minutit järel. edasi hakkas topalov aga mängima märksa kiiremini kui vastane. väga hea käik! anand näitab, et valge suudab järelejäänud viguritega alustada väga ohtlikku kuningarünnakut. 38. rd1 peale on mustal ainus vastus 38...nd3, ideega 39. nc5? nf2+  topalovi mäng selles partiis oli ebaühtlane - ta võis pikka aega teha arvutite poolt soovitatud ainsaid käike (nagu seegi), siis aga eksis palju süütumas olukorras. ajapuudus! palju tugevam oli 40. re4! ning variandis 40...b4 41. rxa7 b3 42. rb7 b2 43. kh2 qc1 44. ra4! nd7 45. rab4 qe1 46. rxb2 qxh4+ 47. nh3 on musta ohtikud etturid laualt lahkunud ning edasine peaks olema tehnika küsimus.  parem polnud ka 41. rd1+ nd3 42. ra8 kc7 43. ne4 qa3  must kuningas pääses ohtlikust tsoonist 8-lt realt. või 42...kb6 43. re7  edasi leidis anand vaieldamatult tugevaima plaani, kuid kulutas selleks ka tublisti mõtlemisaega... ! jälle parim, ei sobinud etturi võtmine: 46. nxg6? nxg6 47. re6+ kb5 48. rxg6 qe5+ 49. g3 ka4 ning musta etturid on ohtlikumad  halb käik, mis pidanuks topalovile kaotuse tooma. ei läinud ka 46... b3? 47. hxg6! b2 48. g7 ja valge võidab, kuid palju tugevam oli 46... g5! 47. rh6+ kb5 48. ne6 üksnes väikese eelisega valgele.  õige! võibolla arvestas topalov, et variandis 48. re6 qg7 49. rhh6 qc7 ei aita valget võidule ka enamratsu - 50. rxc6+ qxc6 51. rxc6+ kxc6 52. nd3 b3 53. g4 a4 54. g5 a3 55. g6 b2 56. nxb2 a2 57. g7 a1=q 58. g8=q qxb2+ järel on laual viigiline lipulõppmäng. jälle parim! teine võimalus polnud nii hea: 49. re6? qb1 (49... qg7 50. reh6 qd4 51. rh7+ kb8 52. rd7) 50. f4 qd3! üksnes väikese eelisega valgele.  või 51... nd8 52. nb6+ ka6 53. rg6 qb1 54. rgh6 +-  53... nb5 54. rg6 qb1 55. rgh6 +-  oioi! taas oli anand sattunud ajahätta - ca 5 minutit ajakontrollini 60.käigul ning jätab kasutamata lihtsa võidu 54. nd5! ja näiteks 54...nc6 kaotab viguri 55. rh7+ ka6 56. rxc6+ kb5 57. re6, kuid midagi muud mustale soovitada ka enam pole.  ! topalovi vastus oli välkkiire - selliseid käike ei mõelnud bulgaarlane praktiliselt hetkegi. ja sai oma tahtmise - anandil polnud aega, et teha valik kahe käigu vahel. paraku näitab arvutianalüüs selgelt, et võitis justnimelt 57. rhh6! a4 58. kg3 +-  ka siin nägi topalov ilmselt kohe, et pärast 58... kc6 59. kg3 b2, on tema kuningas matirünnaku all: 60. r5d6+ kb5 61. rb7+ kc5 62. ne4+ kc4 63. rc7+ kb5 64. nc3+ kb4 65. nxa2+ +- ja tegi sellegi käigu päris kiiresti.  ajakontroll sai täis ning anandile lisandus 15 minutit mõtlemisaega. rahulikult mõeldes leidis ta tugevaima käigu, kuid ausalt öeldes tundus mulle partii ajal, et praktilisem olnuks 61. ra7 a4 62. kg3.  kurb. anand ei leia taas võidukäiku - 62. rdd7! ning näiteks 62...a3 peale võidab 63. kg3 qa1 64. rc7+ kb8 65. rb7+ kc8 66. nxb3 +-  64. rdd7!  fritz jt arvutid sõnavad siin, et võitu enam pole. valgel ei õnnestu enam ajada musta kuningat mativõrku... 66. rb4 qe1+ =  nojah. must võib endale lubada seda luksust, et annab ära oma viimase etturi, kuid annab seejärel igavest tuld.  
-------------------------------------
see käik on praktikas väga vähe esinenud ning pani ka topalovi mõtlema. siin mängiti 2008.a. partiis külaots-grabarczyk 19. b3 (mäng lõppes viigiga). topalovi käik on uus.  valge nõrgestab ilmaaegu oma kuninagseisu. esialgu veel midagi halba ei järgne. viigiettepanek? väga hea käik! valge peab nüüd tõsiselt mõtlema oma kuninga ohutusele. topalov eksibki kohe. seisu pidi hoidma käiguga 31. rd2, mille peale saab must minna võrdsesse seisu 31...fxe4 32. rxe4 oxe4 33. fxe4 vd4. aga võimalik, et mustal on varuks agressiivsemaid käikusid.  see käik sisuliselt kaotab. häid lahendusi valgele siin paraku enam ei olnud. sellegipoolest tegi topalov selle käigu sisuliselt mõtlemata. jäi see käik kahe silma vahele? 35. rg2 lh5+ 36. rh4 lg4 matt!  või 36... ld8+ 37. f6 vf7  ei kõlba 38. h3 hxg4 39. hxg4 vh7+ 40. kg3 ld6+  mustal oli mittu võidukäiku, näiteks 39... vf7 40. vxf7 og2+ ja valge peab loovutama lipu 41. lxg2 (41.rxg2 vh4+ ja matt järgmisel käigul 42...lg4x) 41...vxg2; ka 39... lg5 40. vf8+ kg7 41. vf2 oe4 annab mustale suure paremuse. anandi käik on kõige lihtsam ja selgem.  arvuti pakub, et kõige visam olnuks ratsu loovutamine 40. ld1 vd4 41. rf5 lxf5+ 42. vxf5 vxd1. edukaks kaitseks see muidugi ei sobi.  40... kh7 41. vh8+ kxh8 42. lf8+ lg8 43. lh6+ (43. lxe7 lc8!) 43... vh7 44. lf6+ vhg7, kuid anand valib taas lihtsama tee. partii ajal paistis kommentaatoritele, et käik on viga... ometi nägi anand ilmselt kaugemale, kui pealtvaatajate arvutid võisid näidata.  42. rxe7 vh4+ 43. kxh4 lg4#  valge võinuks võtta lipu tagasi 47. vf7+ kg6 48. vg7+ kxf5 49. vxg4 hxg4! 50. kxg2 ke4 51. kf2 kd3, kuid etturilõppmäng on valgele lootusetu. seda varianti ei näinudki osad kommentaatorid.    must mängib valge käigupuudusele!    
-------------------------------------
my opponent starts with reti's move i play a common reply. afterwards on the databases i found that nf6 is actually more popular, although d5 scores better. reti used to continue with c4. g3 is the most common move here, d4 is second, followed by c4 this looked the most aggressive, the best chance to seize the initiative. nf6, c6 and e6 are all more common. this seemed to me to be a passive reply. afterwards i found that c4 and e3 are more popular and score better. this seemed best, i didn't like the idea of him taking on c5 and following up with b4. this again is rather passive. bf4, e3 and bg5 are more popular, and in my view, better. i thought it logical to bring out this knight, although nf6 is slightly more popular. the logical follow-up to his last move. i decided to delay the development of this bishop, i was dreaming of maybe playing ne7, 0-0, f6 and e5. again logical development by white i wish i had had the courage to continue with my plan. there are two games on the database with this, both black wins! at the time i was worried about white getting in an early e4 so white pins the knight black attacks the bishop of course retreat to h4 loses a piece to g5, so exchanging is more or less forced, although on the database there are a few games where white retreated the bishop to c1, d2 or f4. black cannot allow his pawns to become weaker. white makes a blunder that drops a pawn so i take it! now 10. cxd4 nxd4 11. qa4+ nc6 12. e4 o-o 13. exd5 exd5 14. qb3 be6 15. qxb7 rfc8 16. rac1 rab8 17. qa6 rb6 18. qa4 qxb2 19. rc2 qb4 20. qxb4 nxb4 21. rxc8+ bxc8 22. re1 bb7 23. nb3 nxa2 24. na5 bc6 25. nd4 nc3 26. bf3 rb2 27. h4 bb5 28. re8+ kh7 29. ndc6 bc5 30. h5 rd2 31. bg4 bd4 32. bf5+ g6 33. hxg6+ fxg6 34. re7+ bg7 35. be6 ne4 36. f4 nxg3 37. ne5 bf1 38. bxd5 rxd5 39. kf2 nf5 40. rxa7 bb5 41. ng4 rd7 0-1 was campos alexandr… (2114) vs. oliveira jeffer… (2289). my opponent finds an improvement, which takes us out of the databases. much better than meekly losing a pawn. i can't allow my d pawns to become doubled. this is another excellent move, better than the obvious nxc4, when e5 or retreating my bishop leaves me an extra pawn up. i had to retreat to e7 or d8. i considered this move better, as if i play d8, in some variations the queens get exchanged on the d file and my under-development is exposed. and now he is threatening to exchange on c6 and then take on d6, so i move my bishop to the most active square white exchanges and weakens my pawn formation after dropping the pawn, white has fought back well, and even has an edge now i was expecting this! i could have taken the knight. after bxf6 15. bxc6+ bd7 16. bxa8 o-o bishop moves and then i take on b2. with pawn and bishop for rook, black is doing ok, but i thought the game continuation was ok. i probably was, and my mistake was later on.

-------------------------------------
en esta partida veremos un ejemplo como puede explotarse la ventaja de tener dos alfiles. primer punto de atención, las blancas deciden conservar su alfil de casillas blancas, al analizar la posición con un poco de cuidado, vemos que los alfiles de las negras tienen un limitado rango de acción y entorpecen el desarrollo del resto de las piezas. hasta este momento, las negras parecen haber ubicado correctamente sus piezas, sin embargo puede verse que los caballos no tienen buenos puntos de apoyo, esto decide explotarlo el blanco en las siguientes jugadas. excelente jugada, que permite aprovechar la falta de desarrollo y la inactividad de las negras para tomar control del centro. en esta posición, las blancas tienen ventaja, especialmente por la pareja de alfiles. por ello, la siguiente maniobra, abriendo juego y creando un peón pasado, es el plan más adecuado. la ventaja blanca es decisiva. ahora las negras adoptan una medida desesperada, pero ya no había nada mejor. las negras rinden. 
-------------------------------------
i still can't believe that this is white's best line, but it avoids the main theory of 2. e5 and the obscure positions that occur.  i'm not sure whether this is !? or ?! - white gives up a pawn to change the style of the game.  the position is akin to a veresov (1. d4 d5 2. nc3) or potentially, a french defence.  black's pawn on e4 can only be defended at the cost of a weaknesses at e6 and/or d6 in the event of ... f5 and white gets some open lines.  probably better than 3. dxe4 where white can look to play bg5 to pressurize the nf6 in due course. the gk computer says that this is inaccurate and suggests 5. nc6 5. c3 e6 6. qc2 f5 7. nh3 bd6 8. 0-0-0 0-0 9. be2 bd7 10. d5 as +0.87 for black. personally, i think that white has good compensation for his pawn in this line.  his king is safe, his pieces are freer and he has f3 and g4 to prise open the k-side.  5. bd7 is flexible and looks at playing ... e6 and .. c5, whilst keeping an eye on bb5 threats in the event of ... nc6.  the computer thinks that 6. qh5 e6 6. 0-0-0 bd6 is pretty equal. is this a waste of tempo?  7. qe2 bd6 8. nh3 0-0 9. 0-0-0 re8 10. re1 bc6 11. d5 could leave black's k-side a little fragile and there is the option of recapturing on e4 at moves 9/10 etc if white fancies it.  for my part, i was thinking about ... b5 (which qe2 would have prevented) but i'd probably have gone with 7. ... bd7-c6-d5 and ... c5 to hold the pawn and to compete in the centre.  i don't see that black needs to rush to 0-0 in this position - he can always 0-0-0 instead. it seems sensible to attack the centre at this stage, before playing ... nc6 although the computer suggests  6. ... bd6 7. qg4 0-0 8. bg5 f6 9. bxe6+ as the best line for black.  my personal rule is that if white can get away with playing qg4, you probably don't want to be meeting it with 0-0.  i'll go with 6. ... c5 thanks. 8. f3 exf3 9. nxf3 looks more in keeping with white's plan for an attack, although there's nothing wrong with this move. white gives up what remains of his centre but does he really want an isolated pawn on d4? white's development is almost complete, he has a pawn majority (and space) on the q-side and the e4 pawn is a little isolated.  11. ... 0-0 simply moves the king away from his minor pieces, whilst d6 is already looking somewhat weak.  perhaps 10. ... be7, controlling d6, is better, but it looks rather passive and the bd7 isn't going anywhere. if this looks cavalier, it's based on some relatively sound dynamic principles.  it defends e4 in the first instance, threatens ... g5 and ... e5 followed by ... f4 and looks to utilise black's k-side majority as soon as possible.  granted, e6 is drafty, but i have a cunning plan. stopping 12. ...g5 and threatening to double on the d-file. the computer thinks that 12. ... 0-0 13. qd6 re8 14. a4 bc8 15. a5 is a better continuation.  any takers? ! - the obvious square really. the obvious move, although 14. bd6 might be stronger.  black can play 14. ... a5 according to the computer, although 14. ...g5 demands consideration at this stage.  black's k-side pawn advance looks very imposing.  i really liked this move too.  at a stroke, black frees himself of the weaknesses at e6 and e5 and grabs a share of f4 and d4.  the computer wants to grub around with 14. ... kf7 which looks a bit grotty, but the threat of ... rd8 is actually rather difficult to meet.  15. be3 qe5 16. qd2 rd8 is, on the face of it good for black, but i had an extra pawn and wanted a phalanx, shoulder to shoulder, to advance on the white king.  at this stage, however, i'd be lying if i thought i was better.  equality first as black, then push on to win if you can. the position is, according to the computer, equal.  black's pawn apparently counts for nothing at all, but is that right?  the bh6 looks nice enough, but what if i can play ... f4!?  can white force a pawn through on the q-side? white's only central square is d5. i'd rather keep my dark-squared bishop than my light-squared one.  i have dreams of playing ... f4 or ... e3 at some point, but here and now i'll settle for equality. black's in a bit of a bind here.  his pawns aren't going anywhere and his pieces are tied up. i can't use g8 and b7 is weak.  how to solve the problems? white's pawns start to move, and the threat is 21. b5.  20. b5 nd4 hits c2, e2 and b5 and potentially forces 21. c4 when white has compromised the flexibility of his pawns and the nd4 looks useful.  black might even be tempted to play rxd5 and try to advance his pawns.   at this stage, i wasn't particularly confident about the outcome.  black has an extra pawn, but it's doubled and white has the bishop pair.  can black stop white playing 21. c5 and closing down his q-side for good?  i think white is actually better here, despite the nominal material difference. so what's black's next move? 21. ... rad8! a zwischenzug, or 'in-between' move. 21. ... bc7 22. bxc6 bxc6 23. rxd7+ gives white lots of compensation for his pawn - his q-side pawns are up and running and my pieces are passive.  now, suddenly, the tables are turned.  white has to go backwards at this point.  22. cxb6 rxd5 23. rxd5 rxd5 24. bxa7 nxa7 and white's pawns go nowhere.  suddenly, i felt as if i might survive on the q-side and take advantage.  firstly, though, i wanted to get the rooks off because i thought that would minimise white's winning chances and give me the best chance in the endgame. 22. ... bc7 is supposed to be stronger according the gk analysis, but is too messy for my liking.  here, i get rid of the rooks and use my endgame technique. now we have an interesting endgame.  this is one of those positions where it's worth stopping and looking at it.  white's pawns are more advanced, but black's king can get there first.  the bh6 could find itself trapped if it's not careful and the nc6 can hop into d4 where it dominates the board.  much as i like the visceral thrill of a direct attack on the king, this is a tense, dynamic position.  white blinks first. giving black a passed pawn can only end in trouble, although the alternative sees black play ... a5 and (if necessary) ... b6 to neutralise the q-side.  white can pick up the h7 pawn but at a cost.  25. bb3 a5 26. bxa5 bxa5 27. bg8 kd7 28. h4 bd8 30. bf8 be7 31. bxe7 kxe7 32. h5 kf7 is the line suggested by the computer as best for white, albeit practically equal. 25. ... bc7 is likely to be met by 26. fxe5 bxe5 27. g4 bd4+ 28. kg2 ke6 29. h3 bb2 30. be3 a6 31. gxf5+ kxf5 32. bg4+ ke5 33. bc8 when the q-side pawns start to disappear.  i think that white can hold the draw by a timely sacrifice of bishop for 2 pawns in this line.  white is lured into a check.  what are those bishops up to? finally, black gets to break up those pesky white pawns. and the knight gets big. one of those difficult choices.  30. bd8 avoids the possibility that the bishop gets trapped, but 30. ... bd8 31. fxe5 fxe5 allows the bishop out and gives white chances again.  i was a bit worried by 32. bg5 and 33. bxd8, although 32. bd1 is probably better, restricting the knight's squares and meeting ke6/d7 with bf8, ba4 and c6 if he can get away with it. so which way does white recapture?   whilst this looks to leave the bh6 trapped, 32. bxf4 bxf4 33. gxf4 ke6! is winning for black.  33. ... ne6? 34. c6! is, however, not so hot. 33. ... nd4 34. bg8 is unclear 33. ... bxf4 34. bxe6 bxh6 35. bxf5 throws it all away. 33. ... nxf4 34. bxf4 bxf4 35. bd5 is embarrassing.  any ideas? 33. ... a4 is, i suppose, one of those logical, dynamic continuations in a position like this.  it feels as if it should work (if the force is with you).  34. bxa4 nxc5 35. bc2 bd6 and the bh6 is trapped. the possibility of opposite coloured bishops disappears, white's pawns are on the wrong coloured squares and if i can activate the bishop, we're quids in.  a hint of psychology to this move.  it looks aggressive, and white's reply is pretty forced, but white is now looking to hold the draw, and gets suckered into a repetition.  35. ... kd7 is stronger because i can triangulate the king to lose a tempo if necessary.  36. bg7 ke7 37. bh6 kf7 38. h4 ke6 39. h5 ke7 40. bg7 kf7 and i can waste a move by playing ke7. ?  37. bg7 is, i think, stronger.  white doesn't realise how short of moves he's going to get, and the bishop needs to be on g7 to give flexibility as to when it goes to f8.  black's not exactly blessed in the moves category at this point - his bishop may have potential energy, but that's about it, whilst his pawns aren't going anywhere.  a tempo here or there will make all the difference.  offering a draw, but i've got one more plan. now 40. bd6 is met by bxd6 and the king covers the d-pawn whilst white's king is stuck stopping eddie (né duncan). amusingly, 40. be7 kf7 41. bd8 kd6 42. bc7 bxc7 43. bxc7 kd7 also shows the power of zugswang. in this line, if white ever tries to move the king, f4 falls. surely that's it?  except it's still not that simple.   black can still make a real mess of this.  white's idea is to meet ... bxf4 with ba7 forcing black to give up the bishop.  another moment of decision.  44. ... bxf4 45. ba7 gives white saving chances.  i saw that 44. ... c5+ 45. kxc5 bxf4 46. ba7 be3+ is winning, but after 46. kd5 bb8 47. bd4 kc7 48. ke6 f4 49. kf5 i am not sure that black can break through.  if white can pick up the f-pawn and sacrifice the bishop for the a-pawn, i have the wrong bishop to queen on h1.  i thought i might be able to lure the white king away from the e-file first. allowing white to repeat with 44. kd4 but the last time he tried that, it didn't work out for him.  if he had, i think i would have tried 44. ... kd6 45. kc4 c5, akin to the game continuation. it's only a pawn, and it was getting in the way.  47. kxc5 bxf4 and the check on e3 allows me to get back to b8 now the b7 pawn falls but there's one sting left. now we both have a passed pawn and my doubled pawns don't look healthy.  what's black's move? of course.  if white plays 50. bd2 e3 51. bc3 e2 and ... 52. bf2 (where have i seen that theme before?) wins the bishop and, because white's k-side pawns are fixed on dark squares, the game. and, having exchanged the queens, then the rooks, and then the minor pieces, we arrive at a k+4 v k+3 endgame. black takes the opposition, but there is nothing left for white here.  if the king stays with the a-pawn, the e-pawn will run.  if not, the a-pawn drops and then the king makes its way to the k-side. a couple of examples: 52. kc4 ka5 53. kb3 kb5 54. a4 ka5 55. ka3 e3 -+ 52. kc4 ka5 53. kd4 ka4 54. ke3 kxa3 55. kd4 kb4 56. ke3 kc3 57. ke2 kd4 58. kd2 e3+ 59. ke2 ke4 -+ white realises that he's had enough and resigned.  exhausting, but fun.  please rate the game if you got this far.  cheers, d

(b) the primary cause of all white's subsequent difficulties.  (c) apparently nothing better, bad as this is.  (d) an ingenious and beautiful début, sometimes called the pipeopener.  (e) ill-judged.  (f) never seen in the café de la régence, seldom in simpson's divan.  (g) the flag of distress.  (h) exquisitely played.  (i) it is difficult to imagine a more deplorable situation than poor white's at this point.  (j) the ingenuity of despair.  (k) black has now an irresistible game.  (l) high praise is due to white for the pertinacity with which he struggles to lose a piece.  (m) at this point mr endon, without as much as 'j'adoube,' turned his king and queen's rook upside down, in which position they remained for the rest of the game.  (n) a coup de repos long overdue.  (o) mr. endon not crying 'check!,' nor otherwise giving the slightest indication that he was alive to having attacked the king of his opponent, or rather vis-à-vis, murphy was absolved, in accordance with law 18, from attending to it. but this would have been to admit that the salute was adventitious.  (p) no words can express the torment of mind that goaded white to this abject offensive.  (q) the termination of this solitaire is very beautifully played by mr. endon.  (r) further solicitation would be frivolous and vexatious, and murphy, with fool's mate in his soul, retires.

transposing into modern benoni line with bf4. this should not give black to much difficulty if he has experience in such lines of which i have plenty.   !? alternative variation: 7... bg7 8. qa4+ bd7 9. qb3 b5 [⩲] alternative variation: 7... nbd7 8. h3 bg7 [⩲]   anti main line: white wishes to devoid black of excellent counter attacks against e4. which often arise in the bf4 lines.   alternative variation: 10... re8 11. nd2 nbd7 12. be2 ne5 [ small edge to white]  setting up b7-b5   with the idea of ...nc7 to support b7-b5   alternative variation: 14... ne5 15. nxe5 bxe5 16. bxe5 qxe5 [∞]  clearing the e-file for the up coming exchanges on e5.   white has a slight edge due to his centre pawns. but he can not use them because the knight on c7 holds the pawn on e4 in order to protect d5. furthermore, black has slightly better attacking chances due to the fact that the white king is a little more exposed. so all and all the position is dynamically equal.   i give up a little more in the centre to keep the position dynamic. .   [∞] i might have not calculated everything as white looks pretty good.   ?! alternative variation: [⌓] 24. g3 ke7 25. rd2 b5 26. a5 h5 [∞]    ! the king block aids the pawn and the position.   keeping the only possible file that can be opened closed at least i have one good piece  ! nice idea to try and crack open the f-file but i find away to keep it closed.   ! everything else fails  !! alternative variation: 33... rxa4 [??] 34. rxb3 rd4 35. rxd4 cxd4 gives white control of a open file.  closing the king side for good. now everything shifts to the fight for the b-file of which i have control   if white can win control of the b-file he will win the game. however, i seriously doubt he has enough wood to make that happen.   white invests a rook to gain control of the b-file but it still is well in my control  alternative variation: 42. kf3 kf8 43. nc4 ra6 [=]  the king goes back to blockading duty all i have to do is shuffle the rook back and further for the draw. but!!!  alternative variation: 51. nc4 nxc4 52. bxc4 rb8 53. rb2 rxb2 54. kxb2 [=]  ? i should have just moved the rook and let shamash offer a draw. but instead i put the insane idea in his head that he had something here.  alternative variation: [⌓ ] 54... rc8 55. rd1 c4 56. b4 nxa4+ 57. kd4 axb4 58. nxb4 c3 59. rb1 [⩲]  ?? alternative variation: 55... nxa4+ 56. kxc4 nb6+ 57. kd4 ra8 58. rd3 axb4 59. nxb4 [∞]  alternative variation: 56. rd1 [!] 56... axb4+ 57. kxb4 nxa4  alternative variation: 59. rc7+ kd8 60. rg7 nxd5+ 61. kb5 ne7 [=]  50 move rule is coming into effect over the horizon   
-------------------------------------
king's indian, opening which is a bit more risk taker opening than for example queen's gambit declined or the queen's indian when meeting 1.d4. the idea of king's indian is to battle for the initiative right from the start and not just reacting to the opponents threats. you can come out on top if white gets lured by over-extending and also launching a counter-attack is blacks idea. it is not a big surprise that dynamic player like kasparov used this opening during his career. so white decided to go for sämisch variation. this is true king of the hill variation as for example: tal, spassky, karpov, kasparov, kramnik, have all played the sämisch and they all are world champions. so the idea of 5.f3 is to defend e4 securing stable centre and due this white can attack on kingside, lets say: be3, qd2, bh6, g2-g4, h2-h4, can be used to carry out this plan. white can also attack on the queenside so sämisch can be called as a flexible variation. also, be3 can be played without worrying about ...ng4. well, okay, everyone can agree that knight on g1 seems to be on wrong square at the moment so sämisch has drawbacks and kingside development is rather clumsy.  this has recently popped out again and it seems to be just change of move order. the knight on g1 wants to get out anyway and white usually just plays be3 or bg5 transposing into the main lines. this is one of the moves which i personally prefer. lets say 6...nc6 7.bg5 and 6...e5 bg5 have been slightly in white's favour. books give 6...c5 as a reliable reply here and mention 6...a6!?(which i don't fully understand why) stated as flexible move. i would say the flexible one is to play 6...nbd7 as white is going to show next is he going to play bg5 or be3. when 6...a6!? doesn't seem to have any very good reason to be played but after 6...nbd7 you can't play knight to c6(then again, white can't drive it away with d5). so white decides to go for 7.be3. bg5 ideas were not considered very much in the past until it was found out that be3 doesn't really do anything to prevent c7-c5. by playing bg5 white plays bishop on more active square and black plays h7-h6 in some variations to drive it away. we would need to go deeper in king's indian and go through many variations to show the differences between these two so lets continue with the game. 7.be3 protects d4 whereas in bg5 lines white may lack that protection of d4. in king's indian, black plays e7-e5 or c7-c5 at some point if dream of counterplay shall be taken as possibility(that is what you want to do and not to just stay still while hoping for miracles).  opening up long-castle possibility and maybe trade bishops in some cases by playing bh6. 8.d5 qa5 8. qd2 ne5 favours black and after 8.dxc5 nxc5 9.nd4 ne6 black is doing just fine.  this is rare move here. it was in my head that 8...a6?! is possible and played here but then again why i would go for a move which i don't understand. what is exactly ...a6?! doing in this position as it seems to be waiting move only. if black is going to play ...b5 then it will be played anyway without preparing the move ...a6?!. so i was just thinking that i move queen here as white surely doesn't want to castle queenside and meet the move ...b5 with a strong attack. if white tries to get hold on the kingside then queen can jump there in some variations by doing knight maneuver to e6 aswell so that queen won't be caught there. ?! this asks for trouble. looks more like a computer move than something which human would play. white could have just played 9.dxc5 or 9.nc1 which have been played earlier or maybe even interesting idea g2-g4, bg7, 0-0, and surely black wont be the one attacking. examples: [9. nc1 cxd4 10. bxd4 a6 11. nb3 qd8 12. be2 b6 13. o-o re8 14. rfd1 bf8 15. nd5 nh5 16. be3 e6 17. nc3 qc7 18. rac1 bb7 19. qe1 rac8 20. qf2 ba8 21. rd2 qb8 22. rcd1 ng7 23. f4 red8 (ree,h (2500)-andersson,u (2545), wijk aan zee 1978, ended in a draw).] [9. dxc5 dxc5 10. nc1 rd8 11. nb3 qc7 12. nb5 qb6 13. o-o-o rf8 14. be2 a6 15. nc3 qc7 16. g4 b5 17. g5 ne8 18. nd5 qe5 19. na5 qd6 20. nc6 kh8 21. ndxe7 qc7 22. nxc8 rxc8 23. qxd7 qxc6 (tomescu,v (2447)-aldrovandi,c (2414), taormina 2003, led into whites victory).]  i found it a bit funny that in here has been played 9...re8, which surely doesn't question whites long caslte. 8...b5 makes much more sense. example game from the 9...re8: [9... re8 10. kb1 a6 11. nc1 qc7 12. d5 rb8 13. a4 e6 14. dxe6 rxe6 15. nd3 re8 16. nf4 bf8 17. g4 rd8 18. g5 ne8 19. be2 ne5 20. nfd5 qc6 21. h4 be6 22. h5 bxd5 23. cxd5 qc7 24. f4 (evans,l-mednis,e, new york 1963, led into whites victory).] whites takes what is given.  more firepower towards queenside.  so white got scared under the attack. he decided to carry move to stop b-file attacks and not let knight to go c4 forking queen and bishop. 11.kb1 seems alternative as 11.dxc5 is crazy stuff, as after 11...nc4 and queen moves but after that 12...qb4 seems very dangerous!  putting up more pressure.  of course not 12.bxc4??, as 12...nxc4 drops the bishop due the fact that 13.qd3? qa3+! leads into mate.  ?! better would have been 12...cxb3 13.axb3 qb4 14.nc1 a5 15.qb2 a4 16.bxa4 qxb2+ 17.kxb2 be6 and black is doing good. but i wanted to encourage white to play 13.d5 here. okay, this looks natural here but is actually bad choice. white should play 13.qb2! and white simply seems to keep advantage in every variation, for example: 13.qb2! cxb3 14.axb3 qb4 15.nc1 nc8 16.g4 rb8 17.h4 h5 18.g5 ne8 and white is better. now it is all different, this position seems much harder for white as he needs to find right the move.  ?! white has let it slip away. 14.bxb6! would be the right choice, for example: 14.bxb6 axb6 15.dxe6 fxe6 16.qb2 bxa2+ 17.qxa2 qb4+ 18.qb2, seems equal. even that taking the knight on b6 with a bishop seems like something you wouldn't like as it opens a-file. 15.qd3 seems to lead into transposition of the game after 15...qb4 16.rd2 b2.  i am not sure why. my old notes says that: "this is based on playing by intuition and possibly doubling rooks after moving e-pawn. rook can jump to affect queenside after e-pawn is moved and keeps doubling as possibility. just in case, which most likely doesn't happen, rook keeps f-file in control so no tempo is lost from moving king out of the way. if something happens then white can't do any nasty checks either." but seriously, is this really that much better than just taking with king. well, maybe i should trust my younger intuition! this is actually really nice tactical play as white ends up trading his queen for knight. protecting the pawn. 17.a4 will be met with 17...rc8.   after 17...bxa2+ white is safe if 18. kxa2 qa3+ 19.kb1 qb3+ 20.kc1 rx8 21.rc2 and white has his king in better safety. now threatening mate with ...na3.  white had to exchange his queen and now he seems to be going down.  white can't just wait and do nothing for example: 20.g4 rc8! wins for black and after 20.rc2 nxe4! 21.fxe4 qd3 black is winning. so this is reasonable move protecting squares around white king, opening the line for light-squared bishop and moving knight to better square.  ?! here i missed the strongest move due tactical blindness(i am usually strong with tactics), 20...nxe4! 21.fxe4 bxd4 22.bxd4 rc8 23.nxb2 e5 would be the best.  understandable, white doesn't want to open the a-file.  trying to improve piece placement and attacking b-pawn.  now in here white could have played 22.rd3!? qc5 23.ne6 qc6 24.nxg7 taking the strong bishop away which would have been very good plan. 22.ne6 straight away doesn't work cause 22...rc8 is too strong so white has to play 23.nc7 nxb6 24.bxb6 qb4. opening up the line for f-rook to join the game and basically luring white to play b7 which is bad plan here.  this is already looking bad for white. so now he just starts to collapse by making bad moves from here on. 24.rc2, would fight longer after, 24...nb8 25.nd4 d5 26.rc3 qd6 27.exd5 rxb7 28.bc4 exd5 29. bb3, but white is still losing.  this is not helping anything.  ! now it is over but this move is true beauty! 28.axb3 qa1+ leads into mate.   now white resigned. the attack is going through and white will be mated. this is a good example that even if white would have had chances to play stronger defence and keeping the advantage it is often really hard to defend under the pressure. in this final position whites pieces are just sitting ducks. white simply went for too hazardous option by long castle and then wasn't able to put up the strongest defence. 
-------------------------------------
the maroczy bind – not the automatic win it was once thought to be, but a very tough formation to meet nonetheless. castling would make more sense here. and now black really needs to be castling, not fooling around with queenside pawns. this is too provocative for the black position to bear. ! the start of a plan to trap the light-squared bishop. …nd7 was relatively best, though 12. f5 is not pleasant for black. ! the bishop is short of squares. necessary, as 14. h3 nxc4 15. qf2 nxe3 16. qxe3 qb6 wins for black. !? …gxf5 also deserved consideration, planning to keep the king in the center and get compensation for the piece by attacking down the g-file. white has an extra piece but the weak dark squares, white's exposed king, and black's kingside pawn mass are causes for concern. ! others invite more trouble: 18. rac1 nxe3 19. qxe3 qb6 20. rfd1 e6!; 18. rf4? nxd3 19. qd3 bh6; 18. nd5 e6!; etc. ?? black must take the bishop in order to exploit the dark squares with this move. this move order allows white to hang onto the bishop for 6 crucial extra moves. ! the start of a decisive combination. ? stubbornly hanging onto the a7-g1 diagonal. cowering with …qd8 was better, after which bg5 saves the bishop. ! a sacrifice that threatens to trap black's queen. ? 21. …bxf6 22. rxf6 nxf6 23. nc6! leads to the same, but with an extra exchange for black. white is firmly on top either way. ! ? losing another piece. ! after this calm sidestep, black has nothing. black should really resign here, but plays on until just before mate. note to readers: please do not do this. resigning a hopeless game is a simple matter of etiquette; some of us without premium memberships would like to play someone else and don't want to wait for two weeks.  
-------------------------------------
?! this is a waste of time – it is better to simply develop with 4. nc3. (4. nc3 qxb2? 5. nb5! +-) ? bd3 followed by 0-0 is natural and good. the text leaves the kingside undeveloped, undefends the c-pawn and allows a fork on d5.  threatening …nxc3 and …nxf4; exf4 cxd4 ! the best choice. white will still lose material, but will have more active pieces and pressure on the dark squares. black should still be better, but will have to work hard. ? white takes another tempo to trade off the knight he just gave up a pawn to put on c4. 9. dxc5 nxc3 10. qd3 (or 9. bd6) would be much better. ?? missing black's reply while overestimating the danger of …qa5. 11. qc2 qa5 12. qd2! and now …ne4 is met by taking the black queen. ! black doesn't sit back and relax down a piece, but goes for the throat: the queenside dark squares. ! a quiet move to maintain the pressure. ?! a waste of time, since b4 is unplayable. white needs to be extremely careful in untangling himself: 16. bd3?? is met by …nb5 17. qb1 nxd2 18. kxd2 b6! and white is in even deeper trouble. ?? not seeing the pin. white timed out here, and proceeded to lose the rest of his tournament games by time-out, but black is clearly winning. 
-------------------------------------
this game, played between the last two undefeated players of this mini-tournament, is an instructive example of how quickly things can go wrong in an open game. white made a slight inaccuracy in the opening and, though black (me) did not find the most accurate continuation right away, i was able to pose some concrete problems that my opponent failed to meet actively and energetically enough. the scotch game – though the idea of advancing the d-pawn right away is a simple one, the resulting positions tend to be complex and challenging to play for both sides. the other common line is 4. …bc5, where white has either 5. be3 qf6 6. c3 0-0 7. bc4 with a tense position, or else 5. nxc6 qf6 6. qd2 dxc6, with black's activity compensating for the slightly damaged pawn structure. of course not nxd4 5. qxd4, when white's queen radiates power over the entire board and cannot be easily challenged. i chose 4. …nf6 because in my opinion it gives black good chances to complicate the game and outplay the opponent. popular, but not as challenging as 5. nxc6?! bxc6 6. e5!? qe7 7. qe2 nd5 8. c4 ba6! with extreme complications to come. after the less ambitious text move, black can put the white center under a lot of pressure. …dxc6 is sadly not an option due to qxd8+. ?! an inaccurate move, misjudging the needs of the position. white secures the center pawn, but what he really needs to do now is develop and get the king out of the center. to this end, bd3 is the normal move, while qd4!? is also logical. 7. f3 seems to secure the center for good, but in fact the e-pawn is going to be gone in a few moves, after which white will be behind in development and having the pawn on f3 will just leave a weakness on the kingside. ! striking back in the center immediately. black wants to eliminate the e-pawn and open lines while white is still two moves away from castling.  i also considered some kind of knight sacrifice to allow …qh4+, but i could not find anything worthwhile after 7. …nxe4? (…nd5? is similar) 8. fxe4 qh5+ 9. g3 qxe4+? 10. qe2! and the queen is now pinned and must be traded off, ending the attack. ceding the center to black, though 8. bd3 dxe4 (…d4?! 9. a3 gives black very little) 9. fxe4 (bxe4?! qxd1+ 10. kxd1 bxc3 11. bxc3 nxe4 12. fxe4 bg4+ ∆…rd8(+) and black's pieces are more active) bg4 10. qd2 is hardly better. ? here, being all too happy with my position, i made a careless natural move that should have let white off the hook. much better was …bxc3+!, after which might follow 9. bxc3 cxd5 and now 10. qe2+ can be safely met with …be6 11. bb5+ nd7 with ideas of …a6 and …qh4+, or just …0-0 and a gradual buildup in the center. black has better development and central control, while white has both kingside and queenside weaknesses and lacks a safe place to put the king.  by failing to make this exchange now, black allows white a chance to get the king out of the center right away and avoid the grim fate described above.  the pawn sacrifice with …0-0!? was also interesting and deserved consideration. ? this moment is the critical point that decides the course of the entire rest of the game. white misses his last chance to safeguard the king and equalize.  this is a very instructive psychological error. 9. bd2 seems like an entirely natural and logical move: it develops and breaks the pin on the knight. the problem with this line of thinking is that it misses the urgency of the situation: white's position is extremely perilous and requires radical action. the white king is sitting on an open e-file and needs either three moves to castle safely on the queenside, or else two moves to run to the dubious shelter of an airy (remember 7. f3?) kingside. true, black has no immediate threats against the king, but that does not matter: if the white king does not make it out of the center safely, black can take all the time he needs setting up threats against a sitting-duck target. thus, urgent tactical means are necessary to get the king to safety now: 9. qe2+! qe7 (forced: …be6? loses to 10. qb5+!, winning the bishop – this is why black should have traded last move) 10. bd2 and white can castle safely next move. with the king castled and the queenside pawns intact, white is out of danger. after the text, black is able to keep the white king in the center long enough to build up a crushing attack. not realizing the danger of the situation, white did not look for an antidote: as a lesson to all players, it is hard to find a solution to your problems if you don't know that they're there! white looks to be ready to castle and finish development, but now black is ready to start making threats: ! driving the knight back. this fits in with blacks plans a bit too easily. 11. nb5? bc5 ∆ …c6 puts the knight similarly out of play, but 11. na4 qe7 12. 0-0 bd7 13. b3 bxa4 14. bxa4 gives black only a small advantage. ! exchanges with bxd2+? would just ease white's traffic jam on thr first two ranks. the bishop has served its purpose on the queenside and now reposts itself to control the kingside dark squares. castling is prevented by the threat of …d3+. already, white has very few useful moves. what else? the lsb must stay and block the e-file, the queen and rooks have nowhere to go, and the knight has only a3 as a safe destination. continuing to tie white up and build pressure. ?! white thinks to blockade the d-pawn and allow castling, but this plan has a tactical flaw – the blockade can be broken! white had no better than kf1, thanks to the threat of …ba6. unpinning the knight, yes, but also preventing castling for yet another move thanks to a surprising combination that my opponent overlooked. ?? losing on the spot, though white's game was already very difficult. instead, kf1 is the only safe way to break the debilitating pin on the e2-bishop. black could then increase the pressure either with …a5 (∆ …ba6) or with the simple …nd5.  !! white thought to prevent this move with qd3, but black can play it anyway! there is no way to avoid the loss of material. a creative, though insufficient, response that i had not expected. 15. qxa6? drops the queen to …d3+!, while otherwise the threats of bxd3, d3+, and r/bxe2 are decisive. black's advantage is overwhelming and any number of moves win here, but this one ends things quickly. once you have an advantage, don't sit there waiting for the position to win itself – that's when you get swindled. when you smell blood, go for the throat! 19. kg2 bc5#  an instructive miniature! 
-------------------------------------
comments are from leontxo garcía, so i am violating copyright, but i hope he won't sue me! the game shows a novelty by black in dragon sicilian.  all standard stuff till here.  leontxo says: "! after 15. nxb5?, bxn, 16. bxb, nxf3, 17. qe2, nxg4! black will get the most of the pressure over c2". i say black's position looks promising. something must be taken as wrong in white's attacking scheme. it looked suspicious the bishop outcome in e2, and the assumption that attacking was just to push the pawns up (against a fiachetto? it is ok only when you are ready to sac in g6, or something like that...) a direct strike over the king, supported by c4 pawn, that proves to be very strong. white is already defending. note that the rook move blocks nb5, with the intention to try to annoy or exchanging some minor pieces. but white chooses another plan for defending, and again it proves to be any good.  leontxo says: "game proves this plan to be slow and wrong; it looks much better 18. bh6, to accellerate white's attack)" leontxo says: "novelty, better than the known 19... e5". white reinforces nc3, but i wonder if he had something to fear now. not e5?, self-blocking the bishop's diagonal. the problem is that white doesn't have any way to block the rf8 to enter into the fray. another idea could have been hxg6 (now that the rook is no longer in f), followed by bh6, with an eye on the sac nf5, to open the black king to the rook's action - if time allows it. leontxo comments this move "?!". trying to reach d5, maybe, but this is pointless. leontxo says: "more solid is 21. a3, ra6, 22. bd4".  leontxo says: "be careful! there are very hidden deadly threats.". he refers to a knight or bishop sac in order to exploit the firepower on b2, which in fact happens later. leontxo says it on the next move, but i copy it here in behalf of a better sight: "the deadly trap: 22. hxg6?, nxe4!!, 23. fxn, rxa2+!! and mate in two. if: 22. a3?, bxg4!, fxb, 23. nxe4, 24. nxe4, rxa3#". nice, isn't it? now, i would say that after 22. hxg6?, nxe4!!, white should try 23. gxf7+, and if kxf7, 24. qd5+, exchanging queens and releasing some of the pressure. black can go 23... kf8, and white 24. qd5 all the same. but i cannot say if it saves white.  nevertheless, black finds his way to victory with a difficult-to-see sac. leontxo says: "!!" :-) seeing the following, one can suppose white should have not taken the bishop, but it is difficult to find another move that shields white against the powerful black battery.  leontxo says: "if 24. nxe4?, rxa2+, 25. kxa2, qa6#" this proves nf4 was a loss of tempo.  this sounds a little slow, but white is blocked. leontxo says: "if 25. rd1, nxn, 26. nxnc3, bxn, 27. bxb, qxc3+, 28. rb2, rxr, 29. qxb2, qxbe3, with decisive advantage". qb8+ or h6 don't save white, since f6 defends everything. leontxo says: "? but white had a hidden resource with 25. h6!!, whose main idea is that after the previous line, white could give mate with qb8#. the best line seems to be: 25... nxc3, 26. bxn, bxc3+, 27. nxb, qxc3+, 28. rb2, f6, 29. bf2, kf7, and the black pawns whort more than the bishop".  it gives white again the mate threat with qb8+. leontxo says, "not falling in the trap 26... nxnc3?, 27. nxnc3, bxnc3, 28. bxbc3, qxc3+, 29. rb2, rxrb2?, 30. qxrb2, qxbe3, 31. qb8+ and mate." renewed attack, this time on a2. white has not anymore qb8+, and no tempo to defend a2, so he must play... the knight cannot be taken. if 28. nxn, bxn, and if nd4, nxr provides black with overwhelming advantage... it is correct? :-) ...and white resigned here. either if white could have saved, it seems that this novelty puts a lot of pressure over white queenside castling, putting a question mark over all the scheme of white's attack. the sicilian is endless... :-) 
-------------------------------------
later in his career capablanca switched to 1. d4 marshall copies the opening move. capa plays his usual follow-up. "my first surprise," wrote capa.  (marshall allows the ruy lopez for the first time in nearly a decade) capa plays his favourite ruy lopez or spanish opening. the morphy defense, named after paul charles morphy (june 22, 1837 – july 10, 1884), an american chess player. he is considered to have been the greatest chess master of his era. capa drops the bishop back. marshall attacks the e pawn. capa ignores the attack. black continues to develop, opting for what is usually known as the closed variation, rather than the open variation with nxe4. the game doesn't remain very closed for long though! capa protects the e pawn. black attacks the bishop now, otherwise white will play c3 and drop the bishop back to c2. so the bishop drops back. marshall castles. he thought, incorrectly, that this was a novelty. capa commented "‘castling has been supposed to be undesirable at this point, on account of 8 bd5." - which rather begs the question - "why didn't capa play 8. bd5 then, if he thought it was so good?" capa himself answers "i now felt that marshall had prepared something for me, expecting me to play b-q5 (bd5), therefore without hesitation i played my next move." white prepares d2-d4. this move is still the most commonly played move here, although some prefer other moves, one of which, 8. a4 is now known as the anti-marshall. marshall plays his gambit. capa commented "the sacrifice, if accepted, yields black a powerful attack, although of a doubtful nature, and i am inclined to think that white should come out with advantage." i think for a long time the chess world agreed with this analysis. growing up in the 1960s and 1970s i remember reading an article in the magazine "chess" about a refutation to this gambit. yet today many players consider it sound and play it. opening databases show that results with it are similar to other defences to the roy lopez. currently, armenian grandmaster levon aronian is one of the main advocates for the marshall attack. capa takes. marshall takes back. capa wins his pawn. "i thought for a little while before playing this, knowing i would be subjected there-after to a terrific attack, all the lines of which would be of necessity be familiar to my adversary. the lust of battle, however, had been aroused within me. i felt that my judgement and skill were being challenged by a player who had reason to fear both, (as shown by the records of our previous encounters); but who wanted to take advantage of the element of surprise and of the fact of my being unfamiliar with a thing to which he had devoted many a night of toil and  hard work. i considered the position then and decided i was in honour bound, so to speak, to take the pawn and accept the challenge ... as my knowledge and judgement told me that my position should then be defensible."   -  jose r. capablanca.  ( from his great book, "my chess career." )  black exchanges knights. white takes back. re-positioning this important minor piece. this was marshall's original idea, but is considered  "passé" by most opening books today. the "modern" variation of,  "the marshall attack,"  is 11...c6 and is the usual move at this point. marshall himself found this improvement. "white's move order is slightly unusual, but it transposes into the more natural sequence 12. d4 bd6 13. re1 (today re2 is considered equally strong) 13...ng4 14. h3 qh4 15. qf3" dr john nunn in the excellent book "the world's greatest chess games" 1998. "12 d4 looks like the natural move, but leads to the same thing." - capablanca. black re-positions his bishop. taking aim at the black king-side. "if 13 d4, then will follow 13...ng4." - capa black plays it anyway! "the onslaught begins."  -  j.r. capablanca. "black's attack gathers momentum."  -  gm j. nunn.  he goes on to note that white has no minor pieces defending his king, and that white's entire q-side is still at home. he notes that the black attack looks extremely dangerous and maybe the only reason white survives is because of perfect defence - and the fact that white's queen and light-squared bishop - prove to be a very effective combination of defensive units. "the knight can't be taken, 14.hxg4? qh4 15.qf3! bh2+!; 16.kf1 bxg4 17.qe4 bf4; 18.g3 qh2 and white will lose his queen under unfavourable     conditions."  - gm j. nunn. this move is both offensive and defensive, as it threatens the rook on a1 and also protects the white kingside.  black continues with the most aggressive continuation. "intuitive, and absolutely correct."  -  gm reuben fine. "the tempting move of 15 re8 is met by 15...bb7 16 rxf8+ rxf8 17 qxg4 re8 18 kf1 qe7 19 be6 bd5, and black has the best of it." - capablanca. "the trapper, trapped." -  j.r.c.  "very likely a mistake and overlooking the reply. 15...h5 was perhaps the best way to keep up the pressure." black had nothing better, according to capablanca.   capa says black had, " ... to go on with the attack ... or die."  interestingly in the opening databases i use i can't find any other moves being successfully used by black in this position. fritz seems to think it is the best move. "again white cannot take the knight. 16. qxf2 bh2+ (but not 16...bg3?? 17. qxf7) 17. kf1 bg3 18. qe2(now 18. qxf7+ rxf7+ is check) bxh3 19. gxh3 rae8 20. be3 bxe1 21. qxe1 qxh3+ 23. kf1 qxb2 and wins" - dr. john nunn. "a strong move, but decades of analysis have shown that the most convincing refutation of black's play is 16. bd2!" (dr john nunn). 16. bd2 is indeed the most popular move on my opening databases. 16. re2 is third most popular behind 16. qxf2, although that move loses, as explained above. "one can hardly criticize capablanca's move since after it white retains a clear advantage no matter how black plays." (dr john nunn).  "the tempting move of 15 re8 is met by 15...bb7 16 rxf8+ rxf8 17 qxg4 re8 18 kf1 qe7 19 be6 bd5, and black has the best of it." capablanca. black keeps attacking, giving white a choice of taking bishop or knight. of course there are other moves available.  nxh3+ 17. gxh3 bxh3 18. re4 is given as "hopeless by dr john nunn, and in my opening database i can see white scoring 66% with this. capa took the bishop. marshall threw in the check. the reply is of course forced. protecting the knight and threatening mate in one.

eilonwy's favorite. lately i have been experimenting with 1 ... g6. the move in the game is my old standby. i thought i would revert to this because i had already played the modern defense against this particular opponent and i wanted to mix it up a bit. tried and true. i don't have much experience with this since the large majority of players i have faced choose 3. nc3 rather than face the queen's indian. i don't really know what i'm doing here. i played this move here mainly to avoid the possibler gambit line 4 ... bb7 5 bg2 be7 6. d5. an apparently ignomious retreat, but the point of black's previous move is to pull white's pieces out of optimal position. the black bishop was always headed for b7. if i had been more familiar with the line i may have chosen 5 ... c5. an unassuming move. more aggressive alternatives are 6 ... c5 and 6 ... bb4+. immediately after i made this move i regretted that i didn't look at bb4+ more closely, but as it turns out, the bishop on e7 has a great future. i know from previous games that this guy likes an expansive pawn center. nothing wrong with that as long as you don't allow your opponent to tear it apart later. now both kings are safely tucked away in their respective kingsides; at least for now. so black has completed his minor piece development and white has a decision to make: what to do with the qb? this caught me by surprise. if it had been me, i probably would have opted to fianchetto this bishop. well, why not? black eventually has to make some sort of break in the center, otherwise he'll get squashed. white has decided to lock up the center pawns, which favors the attacking side. i wonder which side that will be, hmmm? white has decided to go on the offence. the bishop eyes the f5 square and occupies an important diagonal. so i counter with my bishop again i was caught by surprise. should i worry about a future qc6? i decide to worry about it, although i did feel like my pieces were going in the wrong direction. white looks better to me here, but i was wondering about his intentions. is he trying to attack kingside or queenside? i think this deserves a question mark, but the computer let it pass without comment. now that white has ceded the important h3-c8 diagonal to black, he can play this important break. what could white be thinking? oh, whoops! the computer gives this a ?? since i'm on the attack, i have no problems with locking up the center even further. of course white can't play 17. g3xf4 because it leaves the knight on h4 hanging. now i'm glad i didn't play 6 ... bb4+ with an aim to trade this bishop! so the queen comes back to the defense of the king. nevertheless, 19. f3 was better. just a plain waste of time. now white can still play f3. finally black decides to prevent f3 and opens up the f-file for his rook to boot. the computer didn't like this and prefers 21. bh3. a possible line is 21 ... bh3 22. bxh5 qg5+ 23. bg4 bxg4 24. qd2 rf4 25. f3 bxf3+ 26. bg3 qg4.  bringing another defender into the fray. now black gets this shot in. so white has managed to save the exchange, but now the f2 pawn is weak. of course, on 25. bg2 then ... rg6 getting ready to bring the other rook to the f-file. at the time i thought 26. rc1 was a better try, but the computer doesn't like it. the computer thinks that 26. re3 is white's second best move, slightly preferring 26. kh1. (a very computer like move. the idea is to get the hell out of dodge!) that's a lot of stuff trained on the f2 square. understandably trying to defend, but he misses black's next shot. removing a crucial defender. of course not 28 ... bg4 29. rxf8+ the end is near. whoops! waiting for the end. with mate coming the next move, white resigned.

una bella manovra di re con minaccia di matto... simpatica. ma sufficiente? questa, anche se l'ho vinta, non sono sicuro di meritarlo. comunque ha il suo interesse! e le sue domande... e qui sto decisamente meglio! mi faccio i complimenti? :-) e qui l'idea: ma lui quell'alfiere lo perde! per�, se faccio direttamente h6, ho calcolato che per il bianco c'erano contromosse mentre prendevo l'alfiere, magari dopo ah4, g5, ag3, f5. tra td1, ah5  aveva qualche possibile compensazione. ma con l'alternativa, quella che ho giocato, c'era anche la minaccia f3! per averla, dovevo probabilmente sopportare l'incursione della torre bianca da d1 a d7 . ho calcolato che il gioco valeva la candela. sembra un brutto errore del nero, perch� perde il pedone in b2 e lascia penetrare la torre. invece... la scommessa era se permettevo quest'entrata di torre pur di avanzare i miei pedoni e ed f, con forti minaccie,  o se invece avrei dovuto preferire la calma e rinunciare alla possibilit� di prendere l'alfiere g4... se il re va in d1, tad1 , rc2, td2 , rxac3, txae2, axf4, tac8 crea problemi, ma anche d1, tad1 , rc2, cd4 , rxace, cxae2 , rd2, f4-f3, con dei pedoni avanzati ben forti anche se si perde, probabilmente, quello importantissimo di a per la torre bianca. comunque, la torre h1 rimane chiusa, e sussisono minacce per il re bianco di torre in 1. quindi buon gioco anche in questo caso. se invece il re va in f1... non serve cd4, allora ho calcolato e ho portato avanti il mio piano, nonostante lo scacco (e anche questo � tutto da vedere). conscio di rinunciare di cercare di catturare l'alfiere nero perch� comunque la torre bianca avrebbe un forte attacco, appoggiata dai due alfieri bianchi e addirittura scacco liberatore in c4... qui non si tratta pi� di catturare l'alfiere g5, ma di sfruttare la minaccia di matto  eventuale con td1, e la costrizione della torre bianca in h1.  ho valutato tf7 , e mi � sembrato che il mio re avrebbe trovato rifugio in h5 il tempo sufficiente da difendermi... per esempio rg4, tg1 , rh5, e qui o ritira l'alfiere (e io passo all'attacco su d), o tenta ad4 (h6xg5, ag4 , rh6 e poi tb6, e anche qui c'� da vedere quali ne sarebbero le conseguenze), o tenta anche tg8 (e questa � quella che ho analizzato di pi�, ma vinco con td8, se non sbaglio, o almeno lo obbligo a darmi l'alfiere bianco per i pedoni avanzati.  non mi sento ancora sicuro di poter scartare tf7  come alternativa per le bianche, per�.  ma a lui � sembrato che avessi ragione! complimenti un'altra volta?:-) forse dovevo accontentarmi di prendere subito. il vizio di complicarmi la vita... qua era troppo semplice ritirare l'alfiere in b2... bisogna sfruttarla, questa minaccia di matto, o no? ma, poi, gli scacchi della torre avrebbero creato dei problemi? qui il gran dilemma. non vorremmo mica liberare la torre in h1, no? o risolvere tutto con un pezzo per i due pedoni neri di e ed f, no? hehe, adesso non si tratta pi� di perdere l'alfiere, si tratta di un matto! :-)  lo salver� tf7 ? � andata pi� o meno come prevedevo, il pericolo sul re nero � una bolla di sapone. per� mi rimane il dubbio: era la strada migliore da prendere? o era meglio pensarci da prima e non permettere la minaccia della torre bianca su c3? io avevo pensato pi� a tg1 , naturalmente. gi�, e abbiamo l'alfiere per tutti e due i pedoni. insomma, ne esco bene, ma forse ne sarei potuto uscire meglio.   ho calcolato che lo scacco in d1 non mi serviva a niente, quindi, avanti con un finale comunque favorevole. invece, non avendo visto pi� avanti, e forse essendo un po' superficiale, non ho visto il pericolo. segue un inspiegabile errore del nero, non ricordo la ragione.  con questo errore (no, non mi chiedete perch�, vi scongiuro) ero gi� riuscito a perdere un altro pedone, importantissimo... insomma io non avrei lasciato perdere, al posto delle bianche. invece � stato quello che hanno fatto! si � arreso troppo presto, secondo me.

sometime you lose by weak moves, but it is not clear were the mistake is...  always necessary in order to prevent the white knight to jump aiming to c7.  it seems an innocent move, but it puts white in troubles.  the good thing about this opening is that, even if black seems to be underdeveloped, at this point almost every move is "good".  the "original" move by white is not good, in my opinion. the price of this uneasy bishop in d8 will create an edge for black. white can play bd3. after the exchange, experience tells that the doubled central pawns are not such a disadvantage as they seem to be at the first glance.  you can choose between let the c2 pawn and develop, or defend it with the king. it is not very important to lose castling rights when the queens are out of the game.  all the ways are open for black. and i prevent d5, the "strong" move for white.  another questionable move by white. i think nf3 is better. maybe he was thinking about pushing the kingside pawns. but bf4 was the good one for white.  now, i am occupying the strong black diagonal.  ok, he can castle kingside. but is it that important? now i lose the black bishop, but exchanging it for him, so no problem.  what is really doing his knight in f4? black is now free to develop as he wants. the plan re1, followed by d5, comes too late for white.  planning, as foreseen, a pawn storm on the kingside... and exchange my wsb. but the rooks are not communicated. of course, i can castle queenside, which i consider the normal plan for black in this scheme. it was interesting for white nxh4, followed by g4. i followed some variants, but it seemed to me that there was no advantage for white in it. he must have thought the same, since he played the rook. as before, he can take the h5 pawn. if rxn, g4 returns the piece. but his king will be very exposed. still, so was mine, after gxb, r moves, and fxd3, so it would have been a good choice for white. aha. now, white is very cramped.  and my rooks communicate, with a good edge.  now it is impossible for him to stop my pawns. if ng5, i can defend f7 or even play rh-g8! a tempo lost in order to free the bishop. of course, my plan is not to take on f3, i don't want to help him. maybe more dangerous for me was c4, hurrying the break in d5.  this knight would have been better in g5. this way, it simply helps me.  maybe, i should have been more aggressive and play hxg3, but nxg4 is good for him. better for him to exchange pawns? but probably i would have taken with the bishop. or bb3, creating some threat on e6. anyway, not easy for white. to tell the truth, there was not any "blunder" by white. simply, small half-weak moves... but that is all it's needed to lose a game. now, my pawns look really stormy! more tempos to defend. now, i think i have a strong edge, but... how to materialize it? better, i think, was bb3, pressing my e6 pawn - my weak one! probably, this was the real mistake by white. or f3? decisions! i must avoid him to block the pawns.  attacking? it's a dream! how to go on? i thought about rh3, that was a good move too.  it comes tactics. kxg4, bh5++ followed later by f2... still, not an insurance! he cannot take it because of rxh2 and loses the bishop... if kxg4, bf4++ followed with stormy checks, ending into a mate or loses the bishop. playing modestly, but i didn't see a clear win after bxb or rf3. you have to choose to pursuit a phantom attack or to get a good final game...  maybe it was wiser for white bxb, rxr, rxr, rxb, kxf2.  wonderful pin... yummy move. i expected re2, to which i would have played bd3... rd2, and things like that. but he made it easier for me. if kh2, rg3 moves for example to g6, and white cannot avoid mate in one.  i will lose the wonderful white bishop, but a quality is a quality! and he will lose another pawn in addition. why not rf4, in order to defend? maybe he is seeking for rf6, but he has no time for that. the normal and wise move here is rb4xd4. i followed phantoms, and played... aha. now i lose the e6 pawn. the only way to make it less stupid i found was... now, if rf8+, ke2 and white is lost. this was my original plan.  the e pawn is his only hope.  he cannot take the b pawn if i play rd4-d5, due to rb5+ and he loses the bishop without compensation. but i wanted to give a sense to the loss of my e6 pawn, so i tried to crunch his king. this was to prevent rd3+, and his king has to retire to b2 or there is a mate coming (kb4, rc4+, ka5, ra3#). i feared all the time e6 and rf3, but he didn't go for it.  look at this nice mate:  44.	bb7		ke6 45.	bc8+		kd5 46.	e5-e6		rd4-b4+ 47.	ka3		kc4 48.	re4+		kc3 49.	re3+		kd4 50.	e7		rc3+ 51.	rxc3		kxc3 52.	e8=q		ra4#  different variations of this theme grant me the win... or i hope this! he went for it. now, he must have felt really good. apparently, i let him hope to reach the 8º row, and as a minimum to recover material...  ok, this is my plan. if he plays the best, he gets in a lost position. otherwise, he's mated. really, really nice. i set the following conditional moves:   47. ka3 (forced), kd4 he cannot abandon the 3º row, or he's mated.  48. e7	rc3+  49. rxc3 (forced), kxc3 and mate in one, no matter white's move.  the best move for white, and the only one able to prevent mate, is: 48. rb3, to which i have another nice move: rc2, threatening mate with ra4.   49. rb2 is met simply by rb4xr, so the only reasonable move for white is  49. rxr+	a5xr  let's see some sequences:   50. kxb4 loses, because of rb2+.  if 51. ka3, 	kc3, and after any white move,  52. 		b4+ 53. rxa2#  if 51. ka5, the only one able to avoid mate, kc5 52. ka6 (forced), ra2+ 53. kb7 (forced), and white cannot stop the black pawn. the plans can be both:   53. ..., kd6, and white has two answers: bd7 (met by rc2) and kb6, met by b4 and goes to queen, even if i havt to sacrifice my rook for the bishop. to give me the pawn with e7, in order to free the bishop, fails since my king has time to come near my pawn again - or the b pawn gets to queen.   but white has another good move, if he doesn't take the b4 pawn:   50. kb3  i have to answer re2. if he takes the pawn, we get into the previous variants. otherwise (by moving the bishop) i play kc5, protecting my pawns... and this should be a win.   you see, all these calculations may seem excessive in such a strong position. but... what if i get only draw? i would shoot myself! :-))) as planned.  the "bad" one. i would have liked more resistance, with rb3. probably i would have won, but work had still to be done.  
-------------------------------------
the moscow variation in the slav defence. white gave up the bishop pair for the sake of faster development and superior control of the center. thus, he usually enjoys a slight spatial advantage in this line, although black tends to gradually equalize chances with correct play. there are many options for white here and on the previous move, but a sure-fire way for obtaining opening advantage is quite elusive. magnus comes up with a rare approach.  the main line used to be 8.bd3 dxc4 9.bxc4 g6 10.0–0 bg7 11.e4 e5 12.d5 nb6 13.bb3 bg4 and although they could claim a slightest of advantages, white came up on top too few times to be able to call this a refutation of the solid moscow variation.    putting this bishop to a more restrained position on e2 (rather than d3) is a sign that white would like to enter the carlsbad pawn structure (more about that in a second). as expected, magnus goes for the structure announced by his previous two moves. now we have one of the oldest known typical middle-game pawn structures: carlsbad pawn structure. for those who may not be familiar with it, it is characterised by 2 pawn chains on both sides of the board as can be seen in the diagrammed position. needless to say, every strong player needs to know the typical plans for white and black in this type of position as carlsbad structure can arise from many openings (including queen’s gambit declined, nimzo-indian defence, gruenfeld defence, etc., torre system and caro-kann with colors reversed, etc.) those plans often stretch well into the middlegame and sometimes as deep as the endgame. carlsen enjoys slow kinds of positions that usually arise in this structure, while topalov is not a big fan of them and i doubt that he has had much experience with them as he usually seeks to play more dynamic positions.  the point of rc1 can be seen in the variation 10…cxd5 11.nb5 a trade-mark plan in the carlsbad is the minority attack. in a nutshell, white’s a and b pawns attack three black pawns on the queenside (thus the name “minority” attack), aiming to create pawn weaknesses that white would later like to exploit with his pieces. a famous example of this plan in a very similar position is game seirawan-kasparov, 1986. that the ex-world champion lost! white achieved his plan relatively effortlessly. the pawn on c6 is currently immobile due to the weakness of d5 pawn. [carlsen seeks to fully employ his pieces before determining the pawn structure on the queenside.]  in that sense, 16.bxc6 bxc6 (intending to create a backward pawn on c6) would be premature. black would benefit more from opening of the position. 16…c5 is premature as white wins a pawn after 17.dxc5 qxc5 18.na4 qd6 19.nxb6 qxb6 20.qxd5; 16…ra3 17.qb2 is rather pointless for black. !? where most players would automatically play rfd1, carlsen becomes creative. the knight is obviously headed towards d3 square via b2. from there, it would control the important c5 square, highlighting the immobility of the backward c6 pawn. the most recent example of this knight manoeuvre in a similar pawn structure could be seen in carlsen’s brilliant positional win over levon aronian in wijk an zee this year. ! excellent positional judgement by topalov in anticipation of the aforementioned plan. the knight on d3 would be stronger than black light-squared bishop, so why not exchange it. consistent.  19…nc4 looks tempting, but effects of such an “active move” are fleeting, while the exchange on d3 is more to the point, positionally speaking. white could continue putting the pressure with 20.ra1 etc. ! topalov achieved the desired break, getting rid of the backward c-pawn, so he has roughly equalized. an isolated pawn structure should not bother black as long as he remains active as he is. ! what a great fighter carlsen is! even in such “dry” positions, he finds ways to create practical problems to the strongest chess players in the world. should black play h5 now and weaken his g5 square or allow white to soften his kingside with the same move? after a long think, topalov decides that he will allow weakening of his kingside after h4–h5, gxh5 and deal with the consequences by active counterplay on the queenside. a risky decision, to say the least.  22…h5 was definitely more solid and i don’t see any immediate benefits white would get from 23.ng5 although it is an achievement for white. probably not the most accurate way to seek counterplay.  more straightforward was  23…nc3 24.hxg6 qxg6 25.qxg6! fxg6 (the point being that after 25…nxe2+ 26.kh2 fxg6 the rook on c5 is not defended 27.rxc5) 26.bd3 rbc8 27.ra1 kf7 28.ra7 when white enjoys a slight, or should i use the synonym, “carlsen” edge in the endgame, but his active pieces promise him very good chances to equalize. ! carlsen curbed black’s queenside activity with this calm move and can claim an advantage as in the addition to a potential target on d5, he already has something going on the kingside. topalov decides that he will at least get something in return for the inevitable positional suffering he will be subjected to by the world champion. logically aiming for the weakened f5 square. a critical moment. carlsen prefers to keep the queens on the board.  the alternative was the endgame  27.qf5 qxf5 28.nxf5 where black’s multiple pawn weaknesses look juicy. yet, he seems to be able to hold with 28…bf8 29.rc1 (winning the d5 pawn with 29.rd1 would give black a breather:29…ne4! 30.rxd5 nc3 31.rd2 nxe2+ 32.rxe2 rc5 with a draw.; as well as 29.bxh5 ne4) 29…rc7! 30.bxh5 (in case of 30.bf3 black barely escapes with a draw after 30…ne6 31.rxc7 nxc7 32.b6 nb5! 33.bxd5 nd6 and he can hold the position with opposite colored bishops even being a pawn down.) 30…ne6 where white could still hold an edge with 31.rd1 rc5 32.be2 ! typical topalov with a sharp eye for tactical solutions. this tactical sequence leads to a queen endgame with good chances of survival for black.  alternatively, he would be faced with prospects of defending an unpleasant positиon in the middlegame, although black’s activity in the view of 29…ra8! 30.bxh5 ne4 31.nd4 qe5 32.qd1 ra2 33.qg4+ qg5 would be sufficient to hold the position even in such circumstances. it seems like the b7 pawn is lost and carlsen would cruise to his first victory in the tournament. ! there is no doubt in my mind that topalov prepared this move as a punchline for the nb3 combination. forced,  as white can not win after 34.qxb7 dxe3 35.fxe3 qe1 36.qe4 bd6 with such a weak king. ?! topalov’s determination to keep white bishop outside of the game is understandable as white can not win the game without its help. yet, the most natural move  was 34…qe4 protecting the pawn on b7, attacking the one on d4 and centralizing the queen, all at the same time. none of the possible variations lead to anything for white. for example 35.g3 (35.bc4 qe1+ 36.kh2 qxf2; 35.qg3+ bg7 36.bc4 h4 37.qb8+ bf8; 35.qd7 h4 36.d5 b6 37.d6 qf4) 35…h4! a double pawn comes in handy to open up the possibilities of perpetual check against white king! 36.gxh4 be7 37.bg2 qe1+ 38.kh2 bxh4 39.qc8+ kg7 40.qg4+ bg5 41.f4 f5! with an inevitable draw. the most stubborn try.  35.qxb7 qxd4 is drawish as the pawn will be blocked on b5. 36.b6 fails to 36…bc5 ?! it is difficult to find the right way in a maze of possibilities, but making the king more vulnerable is rarely a good policy.  it seems that 37…qg4 among a few others would be a more precise choice. ! carlsen mercilessly punishes topalov’s inaccuracy with a quiet move, typical for his style. it proves to be surprisingly difficult to defend the b pawn now. ! this is the point. black can not defend the b-pawn any more. fortunately, he can win the d-pawn and hope to get enough counterplay against white king. now we get a dream endgame “50–50″ scenario for carlsen where there is fifty percent for draw, should black defend accurately and 50 percent for white to win, should black make a mistake. ! virtually the only move that keeps black in the game. he stops g3 and threatens qh4. dealing with the aforementioned threat in the most efficient way. ! again, the best defence. now discovered attack bxf2+ is threatening, so white queen has to leave the d-file. fortunately for black, the geometry works in his favor in case of 44.kh2 qxf1 45.qxd4 qxb5 draw. ? the only real mistake in the game after which white probably gets a winning position.  44…kg7 would keep within the famous “50–50″ boundaries. a simple move that refutes kh7 as taking on f7 and b5–b6 are threatened simultaneously. white gained a valuable tempo to push the b-pawn to the brink of promotion. ! 48.b8q?? bxf2# would be embarrassing. clever, but white repels the attacks with topalov managed to block the pawn, but now he is about to just sit and watch carlsen gradually improve his position until it is winning, which is something he is currently the best at in the world. the problem is not only the dangerous b-pawn, but also weak black pawns on the kingside. if those pawns were on f7 and g6, for instance, black’s drawing chances would be much greater. !? another clever defensive try by topalov, offering a dubious queen trade. carlsen says: “thank you, maybe later”.  indeed, the opposite-colored bishops endgame is drawn, but only due to the fact that black can force an h-pawn with a wrong bishop: 52.qxf6+ kxf6 53.be2 kg5 54.kg2 h4 55.f4+ kf5! 56.gxh4 kxf4 and what would normally be a winning position for white is drawn since black can give up his bishop for b-pawn while keeping the king on h8. carlsen is improving his position ever so slowly. there is not much black can do about it. he could not find relief in queen exchange any more as now white king is positioned much better on h2 and after 54…qf6 55.bg2 qxf3 56.bxf3 kg6 57.kh3 he can not defend his h-pawn 57…kg5 58.be2 bb8 59.f4+ kg6 60.kh4 bc7 61.bxh5+ and white is winning since he will be able to force another passed pawn on the g-file.; however, the last attempt to hold the position was 54…h4 55.kg2 (as 55.kh3 hxg3 56.qxg3+ kf6 57.b8q bxb8 58.qxb8 qxf2 is drawn.) 55…bb8 carlsen is beginning to measure up black’s weaknesses on f7 and h5. looks like h5 pawn will not survive much longer. ! it turns out he is interested in the f7 pawn after all! as usual, topalov goes all in with a tactical sequence. as it turned out, this was the best practical decision!  a more stubborn defence was 57…ba7 58.bb3 qd7+ 59.kh2 (59.kh4!? would be very brave 59…bb8 60.kxh5 bd6 although i am not sure anyone would feel comfortable playing this with qh3 and be7 in the air.) 59…qe7 and white still needs to make the final break. 58…qg4+ would allow white to win quite easily 59.qxg4+! hxg4+ 60.bxg4 fxg4+ 61.kxg4 and black is stretched too thin. this was topalov’s idea. white can not take the bishop on b8 as checkmate is threatened on g3.  59…fxg3 60.fxg3 would presumably be easily winning for white as any queen exchange would lead to a winning bishops endgame. as topalov played his 60th move, carlsen sunk into thought looking for the winning continuation. unfortunately, he spent all his remaining time, not being aware that there is no increment after move 60 (which was the case in last year’s tournament)! it is difficult to say who was more shocked by this turn of events, carlsen himself or the spectators around the world who could not believe seeing the result 0–1. sadly, such an interesting struggle had to finish this way.   leaving the unfortunate fate of this game aside, does white have a win after  60…kf7 ? he does indeed, but working it out at the board is quite a difficult task, regardless of what many “couch-experts” (with houdini or stockfish running on their computer) might say. the right move is 61.bc4+! (the attempt to attack from the kingside with 61.bh5+ ke6 62.qg8+ kd7 63.qc8+ ke7 64.qe8+ kf6 65.qf8+ fails to bring a full point as the king escapes to the center (an interesting attempt to create a checkmating net with the help of white king is 65.qc6+ ke7 66.kg4!? qxg3+ 67.kf5 but black has 67…qd3+) 65…ke6 66.bg4+ kd5!) 61…ke8 62.bb5+ keeping the king away from the central squares 62…kf7 63.qf5+ ke7 64.qd7+ kf6 65.qd8+!     the key check and the one that might be the toughest one to find in the calculation of a long line. the point is that black king can not step onto e5 due to qxb8 with check, so it has to stay in the corner. 65…kf7 (65…ke6 66.bc4+ kf5 (66…ke5 67.qxb8+) 67.g4+! is even simpler.) 66.bc4+ kg6 67.qe8+ kf6 68.qf8+! using the same idea to keep the king away from e5! 68…kg5 69.qg7+ kf5 70.g4+! this move is essential, otherwise white can not win!  (70.bd3+ ke6 leads nowhere.) 70…ke4 71.qg6+! another key queen check preventing king’s run toward the center 71…kf3 (as 71…kd4 72.qb6+ wins the queen!) and now white wins with a study-like queen manoeuvre: 72.qc6+ ke3 73.qc5+ kf3 74.qd5+ ke3 75.qd3#!     a beautiful winning combination and a beautiful final position, too bad we could not see it happen at the board! 
-------------------------------------
[it goes without saying that caruana is one of the world’s leading experts on the gruenfeld defence.] !? [carlsen “finally” plays something concrete against the gruenfeld. he’s been toying with a host of off-beat systems against this opening lately, but today it seems that he is fully prepared for a sharp theoretical battle. we should add that this move prepares to take the centre with e4, but the main difference between this move]  [and the more natural 3.nc3 is that in the latter case, black can trade a pair of knights with 3…d5 4.cxd5 nxd5 5.e4 nxc3 6.bxc3] [following the gruenfeld course is caruana’s favorite and usually the most natural choice for gruenfeld players in this position. however, i will give a small expose on a number of other options for black, which might be a good starting point for those interested in learning this interesting line.]  [king’s indian players prefer 3…bg7 4.e4 d6 which usually transposes into the main lines of the saemisch kid after 5.nc3 (although another interesting development scheme exists – 5.ne2!? 0–0 6.nec3 aiming to develop the knight from b1 to d2 or a3.) 5…0–0 etc.; another popular approach is “tango” style 3…nc6!? to which white usually responds with 4.d5 ne5 5.e4 d6 6.nc3 etc. with complex play.; benoni aficionados would probably go for 3…c5 4.d5 bg7 5.e4 d6 6.nc3 e6; and those willing to experiment with totally unorthodox positions might try 3…e6 4.e4 d5; or even 3…e5 4.dxe5 nh5 although this line may be too risky as the following game shows: 5.nh3 nc6 6.bg5 be7 7.bxe7 qxe7 8.g4 ng7 9.f4 d6 10.exd6 qh4+ 11.nf2 bxg4 12.dxc7 be6 13.qd2 0–0 14.nc3 bxc4 15.e4 bxf1 16.rxf1 rac8 17.nd5 ne8 18.qc3 ne7 19.qh3 1–0 (19) hammer,j (2633)-yankovsky,r (2474) las vegas 2012] [we can see now that white has avoided the knight exchange by postponing nc3 and he still has a strong center. the f3 move has other drawbacks though, but to paraphrase an old saying: “no move is perfect”.] [quite naturally, white prepares to castle long and follow up with a typical kingside attack: bh6, h4–h5 etc.] [the first small junction.]  [8…e5 9.d5 c6 was topical for a while, but a few nice white wins after 10.h4 cxd5 11.exd5 n8d7 12.h5 nf6 13.hxg6 fxg6 14.0–0–0 have generally discouraged black from challenging white center in such a direct manner. however, the line is not dead yet, as it was succesfully employed by gelfand in the 2012 wch match against anand. for those interested in playing it, i suggest coming up with some improvement with engine assistance and triple-checking your analysis before the game.] !? [this move is the new hit. caruana has already played 4 games with it, losing two and drawing the other two. his decision to stick with it is a sign that he has upgraded his analysis.]  [a long time ago, the principled looking 9…e5 10.d5 nd4 was played almost exclusively, but things have proved to be a little suspicious for black after 11.f4 etc.; another common approach is 9…f5 10.e5 nb4 11.nh3 be6 although it has been going through a certain crisis over the past few years.] [immediately attacking the queen is the most popular move here.]  [last year, nakamura has challenged caruana with 10.h4 rd8 11.nb5 qd7 12.h5 a6 13.nc3 when the young american-italian blundered with 13…nxd4 (13…bxd4 is possible as well.) 14.hxg6 hxg6?? (14…fxg6 15.g4would lead to a complicated position.) 15.bxd4 qxd4 (or 15…bxd4 16.qh6 and black loses a lot of material)16.qe1 and black had to give up the queen for no compensation in nakamura,h (2772)-caruana,f (2779) elancourt fra 2013, 1–0 (34).] [the last word of theory. several moves have been tried here with pretty good success for white. the theory of this line is still developing, so i will just mention a few recent games that are relevant for the 9…qd6 line. the reader is free to explore them more deeply at his leasure.]  [11.f4 qe6 12.nc3 nc4 13.qe2 nxe3 14.qxe3 nb4 15.kb1 c6 16.nf3 nd5! 17.nxd5 cxd5 18.e5 and black was doing ok in a game that was played just a few days ago: bachmann,a (2589)-kovchan,a (2558) zalakaros hun 2014, 0–1 (36), although he won the game only after his opponent blundered.; 11.bh6 bxh6 12.qxh6 a6 13.nc3 nxd4 14.f4 f6 15.nf3 e5 16.fxe5 fxe5 17.nxe5 qd6 18.nf3 c5 19.bd3 qf4+ 20.qxf4 rxf4 21.nxd4 cxd4 and players reached a drawish endgame in sadler,m (2646)-svidler,p (2758) london eng 2013, 1/2 (44).] [the optimistic experiment 11…f5 didn’t end well for black after 12.h4! fxe4 13.h5 e5 14.d5 nd4 15.nxd4 exd4 16.bxd4 qxd5 17.bxb6! qxd2 18.rxd2 axb6 19.bc4+ kh8 20.hxg6 and white soon won in laznicka,v (2677)-zhigalko,a (2619) warsaw pol 2013, 1–0 (31) .] [the pressure on d4 became unbearable (a6 was threatening), so white pushes the pawn further.] [13.dxc6 wins a pawn after 13…qxd2 14.rxd2 rxd2 15.bxd2 axb5 16.cxb7 but black gets a strong compensation after (or 16.bxb5 bxc6 17.bxc6 rb8) 16…bxb7 17.bxb5 rd8] [a very useful move. the queen gets out of the way of the other pieces and wants to use the pin to break white’s center with e7–e6 push.] [carlsen deviates from the game gelfand-caruana in zurich last year. with this move he still keeps his attacking prospects with bh6 open.]  [gelfand copied caruana’s queen manoeuvre with 14.qe1 and the game continued 14…na7!? 15.h4 nb5 16.nge2 nc4 17.bd4 nxd4 18.nxd4 nb6 19.h5 e6 20.hxg6 hxg6 21.f4 giving rise to a sharp play where black was doing great. the game, however, ended in a draw.] [a logical follow-up.]  [it might seem like 15.bxb6 cxb6 16.b4 wins a piece here, but black has a nice tactic 16…bd7! 17.bxa5 rac8 18.nge2 rxc3! 19.nxc3 rc8 that equalizes the game after 20.rd3 bb5 21.re3 bxf1 22.rxf1 bxc3 23.rxc3 rxc3 24.qxc3 qb5+ the point! 25.kc2 qxf1; a recent game berczes,d (2497)-sarkar,j (2452) dallas usa 2014, 1/2 (45) saw 15.h4 e6 16.bg5 f6 17.bd2 nbc4 18.bh6 bxh6 19.qxh6 exd5 20.h5 d4 with a complicated position, when black was, again, doing more than fine.] [caruana shows that he knows in’s and out’s of this line.]  [the immediate 15…e6 would be inferior as after 16.bxg7 kxg7 17.h4 exd5 18.h5 the king is more exposed on g7 than g8.] [threatening ng5 and qxh7.]  [if white attacks with 17.h4 exd5 18.h5 black wins an important defensive tempo with 18…qf8! since the queen trade is in his favor.] [caruana decides to stop the threat with defense along the 7th rank,]  [although chasing the queen away from h6 with 17…qf8 was a noteworthy alternative.] ! [i was wondering what carlsen would play in this position as it seemed that his attack has come to a halt. he came up with a very interesting pawn sacrifice that allows him to complete the development.]  [18.ng5?! would only help black 18…f6 19.nxe6 bxe6 20.dxe6 rxd1+ 21.nxd1 qxe6 and it’s already white who fights for equality here.; 18.nf4 e5 19.nd3 seemed quite decent. with the knight out of the way, white is ready to push h4. but black probably equalizes after 19…c6 20.qe3 nac4 21.qc5 qxc5 22.nxc5 ne3 etc.] [caruana decides to refuse the greek gift and probably rightly so.]  [white’s attack after 18…exd5 19.nf4! looks scary in all variations. 19…be6 (19…c6 20.exd5 cxd5 21.nh5!; 19…d4 20.ncd5 qe5 21.h4; 19…dxe4 20.nxe4 followed by ng5 or nh5.) 20.nh5! (or 20.h4) ] [however, with the closed center, white now has a free hand on the kingside. if black doesn’t manage to push c6 soon to break white’s center, he will find himself in a difficult position with little counterplay.] [caruana activates his idle knights.]  [it turns out that 19…c6 is one move too slow due to 20.h4 cxd5 21.h5 qf8 22.qg5! f6 23.qc1 d4 24.hxg6 hxg6 25.nd5! and white has a crushing attack.] !? [a move that black probably doesn’t want to make as this blocking square is usually reserved for the knight, but it stops h5 for the time being.]  [the active try 20…qb4 runs into 21.bxc4 nxc4 22.nd3] [i was a little puzzled by this positional decision. trading the bishop has positive sides, like freeing the d3 square for the knight, but i think it also makes black’s life easier.]  [that being said, i think it was better to avoid exchanges and immediately play 21.qc1 b5 22.h5 g5 23.b3 nb6 when black has two clumsy knights to worry about, rather than one, like in the game.] [making h5 thrust possible.] [this move is strategically risky as it weakens the queenside, but black can hardly do without it.]  [if he plays 22…c6 now, white obtains a nice advantage with simple forcing moves: 23.b3 nb6 24.qe3 cxd5 25.exd5 f5 26.rhe1; on the other hand, 22…rb6 is simply answered by 23.nd3] [now white controls critical squares b4 and c5 and all he needs to do is take measures against c7–c6. if he manages to do that, his position will be clearly better simply because he controls more space and his pieces are superior to his opponents.] [up to this point, carlsen played a perfect game. but now he plays a careless move that throws away everything he’s been working for…]  [allowing white to open the h-file 25…c6 26.hxg6 fxg6 would be terrible risky. white can continue 27.rh6 rf8 28.qa3! with dangerous threats all over the board.] ?? [the idea of opening up the kingside with f4 is sound, but the timing is completely off. black now gets the time to open the center with c6.]  [carlsen should have simply played 26.qe3 when c6 is impossible as the knight on b6 is hanging. if black tries to defend it with 26…rb8 white can answer (26…a5 may be a little better, but white still keeps a clear positional advantage with 27.qc5 b4 28.nb5 bxb5 29.qxb5) 27.qc5 c6?! 28.nb4! with a winning position.] [just in time! now the game becomes completely unclear.] [the best chance.] ? [but this move is a mistake.]  [white has to play 28.fxe5 and then 28…rc6 29.qd2 be6 leads to a dynamically balanced position. black’s chances may be slightly better, but this was definitely better choice than the game continuation.] ! [this move works due to a nice tactic that carlsen may have missed somewhere in his previous calculations. now black takes over the control of the game.] [trying to utilize the pin on rd6.]  [the point is that 29.ne2 is answered by 29…bc6! 30.nxc6 qxe4+ and black is on top.] ?! [maybe not a bad practical decision, but definitely giving up a piece can’t be right from a purely chess perspective. but this move gives us some valuable insight into the inner workings of the world champion. this is not the first time he gives up material in a troublesome position in order to keep his opponent busy and maintain piece coordination. he likes to do this especially as the time trouble approaches, putting additional psychological pressure on his opponents and making conversion of the advantage more difficult.]  [30.nd5 nxd5 31.exd5 was objectively better, but carlsen probably judged that caruana would find the best moves more easily in this kind of position than the game.] [white has two pawns for the piece and some activity to show for it. generally speaking, though, black should win this game with precise play.] [black doesn’t lose any of his advantage by exchanging queens.]  [however, he could have also avoided the queen swap with 31…rad8 32.rhd1 nc8! (the tempting 32…rxd4? 33.qxe7 rxd1+ would be a huge mistake as white’s threats are far more serious than black’s. 34.kb2) 33.rxd6 nxd6 and if 34.qxa5 f6 sometimes, especially with exposed kings, this kind of material advantage can be converted more easily with queens on the board.] ! [the knight on e5 holds white’s position together, so this move makes the most sense.]  [33…f6 would only create additional weaknesses in black’s camp. 34.ng4 would follow, with a sufficient compensation.] ? [the right idea, but wrong execution. caruana maybe got a little excited, or he was in a slight time trouble, so he forgot]  [an important intermediate move 34…gxf4! and after 35.gxf4 (the point being that 35.nxd7 is answered by35…f3! 36.nf6+ kg7! 37.rxe7 f2 38.rd1 kxf6 and black wins.) 35…nxe5 36.rxe7 nc6 37.rd5 nxe7 38.rxb5 nc6 we reach a similar position as in the game, but with an extra pawn for black. his extra piece should definitely prevail in this endgame.] [nicely using the geometry on white rooks.] [but white has a trump of his own. this move keeps carlsen in the game.] ! [an important intermezzo.]  [36…nxe7? fails to the intermediate move 37.rxg5+ kf8 38.rxb5 and with three pawns for the piece white already has little to worry about.] [we have reached an unusual endgame where white has, let’s say, 2 and a half pawns for the piece. black should have better chances to win the game, than to draw, but carlsen is known as a very resourceful defender, so it might be closer to 50–50 in this case.] ?! [it is clear that black wants to play rb5, leaving the eight rank open, so why waste time on this manoeuvre?]  [it would have been more purposeful to activate the king, for example 39.kb2] [an interesting try was 42.ra6!? hoping for 42…rxg5 (however, black can just play 42…rc5! followed by nc6 etc.) 43.h6+ kh8 and then (43…kf8?? 44.ra8+) 44.kc2 and white will eventually win the a-pawn with good drawing chances.] ?! [it’s hard to judge this move as it seems so natural to win the pawn.]  [however, a move that appeals to me better is 42…nc6 which immediately activates the knight. maybe caruana didn’t like the fact that white can win the h-pawn by force with 43.h6+ kg6 44.rg8+ kh5 45.rg7 but here i like 45…ne5 46.rxh7 kxg5 47.rh8 ng6! and i have a feeling that black should win this endgame.] [black’s main problem is passivity of his pieces. even though he is a piece up, it is not being felt. and carlsen just keeps on forcing pawn exchanges, inching his way closer to a draw…] [after a long think, caruana sets his king on a logical course towards the g-pawn. the only question is, will he be in time?]  [perhaps the last opportunity to activate the knight was 48…nc6 white should then go 49.ra8 (as the k+n vs. k endgame after 49.rxe5 nxe5+ 50.kd4 is lost for white after 50…nxg4 51.a4! kf6! 52.kc5 ke6 53.kb5 nf6 54.h6 ng4 55.kxa5 nxh6 56.kb6 kd5! 57.a5 nf7 58.a6 nd6 59.b4 kc4 60.kc6 nb5) 49…rg5 50.ke3! rxg4 51.ra6 keeping drawing chances.] [the next few moves are pretty much forced.] [the only move. carlsen keeps on walking a tightrope successfully.] [caruana finally goes after the g-pawn.] ! [carlsen manages to create counterplay with the passed pawn just in time.] [it is obvious now that black will have to give back the knight to stop the dangerous passer, which would leave him with an extra h-pawn in the r vs. r endgame. unfortunately, this kind of rook endgame has drawish tendencies, unless the defender’s king is cut off very far (at least on the d-file).] [60…ne3 was the first opportunity to do so 61.b6 nc4 62.b7 na5+ 63.kb6 nxb7 64.rxb7 rxh5 but it seems that white would have no trouble holding the draw after 65.rh7! rh1 66.kc5 h5 67.kd5 h4 68.rf7+ ke3 69.re7+ kd3 70.ra7 etc.] [caruana basically agrees to a draw by move repetition.]  [62…nd3 was a little more stubborn, as black manages to trade the knight for the pawn after 63.b7 nc5 64.kd6 nxb7+ 65.rxb7 ra5 and white can still go wrong for instance with 66.rb4+? (but it’s still a draw after 66.ke6! h5 67.rh7 kg4 68.rg7+ rg5 69.ra7 h4 70.ra4+ kh5 71.kf6! rd5 72.ra3 rd2 73.kf5 rf2+ 74.ke4 kg4 75.ra8 re2+ 76.kd3 re7 77.rg8+ kh3 78.kd2 etc.) 66…kg5 67.rb8 h5 68.rg8+ kf4 69.rh8 kg4 70.rg8+ rg5 and black is winning] [a good fighting game with a somewhat dissapointing result for both players. carlsen had a clear advantage in the middlegame, but spoiled it in one move, while caruana walked by a few promising ways to capitalize on his material advantage.] 
-------------------------------------
the game starts off with a queen's gambit...  declined. this seems counter-intuitive, blocking in my light-square bishop, but it's solid (there was another game where i played bf5, intending to play e6 next move. i paid heavily for it - the annotation of that particular game will come soon)  i would also consider nf6 some time  white prepares a kingside fianchetto, but according to gk analysis (which had labelled all moves as 'book' so far) , this is an inaccuracy that gives black a .53 advantage. gk gives 4.nc3 nf6 as equal in the position.  making room for queenside castling (though i never do so in the game)  logical  there is nothing wrong with this move, but if i were to reach this position again, i would like to try something different; qe7, 0-0-0. g6, bg7 and nf6, if i get the chance. the resulting game for black would be less cramped than the position he finds himself in soon.  ? i played this move a little too quickly, and was immediately dissatisfied with it. it seemed good at the time, the bishop acting a little like a sniper zooming in on white's position, but it gets driven back too easily. the gk analyser gives dxc4 as preferable (and it does make sense now, since the bishop can't recapture anymore)  ?! what i feared, but white missed the more powerful c5!, where the bishop would then be trapped and captured. here, black can keep the diagonal with; 7...ba5 8.b4 nxb4 [8...bb5 9.c5] 9.axb4 bxb4, but i didn't like the look of that position  this is where i began to feel cramped. i would prefer to be white in this position, but the gk analyser gives this position as equal (well, .08 advantage to white, but that doesn't really make any difference)  i decide that it's safe now to take the pawn (black doesn't really have much else at the moment) but this is promptly met by...  ! white gains the classical centre... but apparently, it is now a .45 advantage to black. how strange....  ? (personally, i give myself this) this was the start of a very silly plan, and afterwards i dismissed it immediately. the plan was a kingside pawn storm, but that is hazardous for my king, for sure! 0-0 would be better [and in fact, it would have saved me a lot of heartache! you'll see what i mean :)]  targeting black's c4 pawn. however, when white played this move, it gave me notice of an interesting feature in white's position...  not only defending the pawn on b3, but also beginning an inevitable journey to the knight outpost on b3, where it will be difficult to budge.  putting a second attacker on the c4 pawn - of course, black needs to do something about that. but first...  a zwischenzug! [what a weird name!] white needs to save his rook first!  the better of the two choices  now that the c-pawn had become so important for the knight, i had no worries with playing this move. true, it does invoke weaknesses in black's queenside position, but right now black plans to castle kingside... i was wondering whether white would try 13.nxc4 bxc4 14.qxc4, but it turns out....  that white had a different sacrificial idea altogether! from here, i saw the line up to move 17, where i thought that i had a refutation idea to white's idea... [you know, i;ll take the opportunity now to tell you all something that i really hate about gk's analysing system - you play a move like this, it looks pretty, it works wonderfully... then along comes gk analysis, saying that it was an 'inaccuracy/mistake!' here, gk gives 'inaccuracy,' although it ends up being 0.48 in black's favour - still anyone's game!]  the point of the sacrifice - white attacks both the knight and the rook on a1 ( a consequence of black's 12...b5)  ?! black does see that there are two pieces on the square that the knight had just leapt on, but like i said, i thought that i could weather the storm. gameknot labels this a mistake, and instead prefers 14...c6, giving back the piece to loosen the pressure on the black position. (… c6 14. exf6 bxf6 15. be4 h5 16. be3 nxd4 17. qd2 qb6 18. rbd1 e5 19. f4 bg4 20. fxe5 bxd1 21. qxd1)  the most natural move, and again gk calls it a mistake. the line it suggests is 15...nxd4, whick i had considered, in fact. however, i had dismissed it because i didn't like the position of the knight. the analysis, however, finds a way around that ( nxd4 15. qd1 bc6 16. qxd4 bxd5 17. rd1 c6 18. qf4+ kg8 19. qg4 qd7 20. be4 qc7 21. bxd5 exd5)  the envisioned position...  ? and a miscalculation - ke8 would have been best, i believe. now...  ! it's not just an exchange anymore - the rook is now won!  ?? ohh boy, did the analysis not like this move - from -1.45 to -7.14! (… ke8 17. bc6+ bd7 18. e6 bf6 19. exd7+ kf8 20. bxa8 qxd7 21. bc6 qd8 22. bxb5 nxd4 23. qb7 nxb5 24. qxb5) by the looks of things, bf6 was black's best try here  by taking the bishop instead of the rook, white creates a powerful mating threat on f7. again...  the most natural looking move in this position also loses! (the best line gives 6.88 for white - i guess this was more of a 'mercy killing' than anything!)  mate in 3. (qc6+ also works)  ...g6 drags it out, but there isn't much point in that really...  game over! white's sac created a pretty sharp position in the game, and one slip from black (as you can see from the change in gk analysis' score) sent everything crashing down! (and i felt that white might have been winning for some parts of the game, even though gameknot put the game as equal before the sac) still, i do like these kind of games, just 'cause it makes things interesting! good game :)  
-------------------------------------
black is creating a solid scheme i use to play with white pieces... but with the bishop closed in c8, it is just too passive.  since he has no intention to play c5, i can play this b on his optimal square for attack.  here we go.  nf3 is ok, but i am looking for blood.  ...my blood? you'll see... with a mate threat. only move... maybe nf3 was more accurate.  threatening ng5 and nxf7 for the least.  my good b is gone, but now i can bring my other r to h3 or g3. maybe nh4, with a sight on ng6+ was good, too, or even better.  tactic, tactic... ...the only move for black is rxn, after which i'll play qg6, with the terrible threat rxh6+ and mate on the next. if he plays... ...this is mate in two. et voilá. it won't be so easy in the future... but a nice goodby before sleeping. thanks for watching.

regular. hi. you’re still reading this? oh, just stop. i need you to stop reading. kay? oh kay, you said it. i am black. yep ooh declined  oof kings gambit? oof pinned heh. i once played a blitz game where my opponent went 5. bxf7+ kxf7 6. ng5+ qxg5 7. fxg5 bxd1. oh oh  oops -11 oof oops yum um yay yay ooh  castling  ah oh  pawn trade oh searching for doubled rooks aw man wellwellel hey ? checkmate. in this case, for white, i would rather not have a queen blocking the king’s escape route. no queen checkmate! this is sorta like a smothered mate, but not really. 
-------------------------------------
this is a game i played a little while ago where i neglected the safety of my king - and paid the ultimate price for my folly. listen close and pay heed, for ultimately this - the safety of the kings - are the alpha and the omega of the game! so this then, though a cautionary tale, should not be read to mean that you should just cover in the corner like a frightened rabbit. far from it! but it is better to attack from a strong position than from one riddled with weaknesses... so, i play the sokolsky here - 1.b4. it is, to put it mildly, a somewhat uncommon opening choice. it is the 6th most common opening move here on gameknot, but considering the enormous preponderance of 1.e4 and 1.d4 that still translates to barely 1/2 of a percent of all games played.... somewhat surprising, actually, as it is eminently playable. anyway, enough advertising! my esteemed opponent choses the standard reply here: e5. one of the hallmarks of the sokolsky is this development of white's dsb (dark-squared bishop). and indeed, somewhat in contrast with other openings at his disposal, white will often see his queenside developed a bit faster and easier than his kingside. or, stated differently: i need to be a bit careful with the safety of my king here, as it is likely to remain in the center for a little while until i can get those other kingside pieces of the way. and the more so as i will almost invariably find myself castling short because the queenside is definitely unsafe now (after 1.b4). i trade a flanking pawn for a center pawn and will now proceed to prove that this is to my advantage. or that at least is the general idea... notice how black is already ready and primed for castling, while i have achieved nothing whatsoever on that front? in *principle* i may be correct in my claim that exchanging the b-pawn for a center pawn is a very good trade ... but black has excellent compensation for that (minor) loss: my king is still far from safe and any kingside development will take quite some time yet. the gk engine claims this is a mistake (it prefers 4.a3 instead), claiming a black advantage after 4.c4 o-o 5.nc3 ng4. but i don't intend to follow that line at all... forcing black to choose between keeping his bishop on the a5 diagonal or retreating it towards e7. the position requires this (the alternative would give black good attacking prospects on the kingside), but notice something? i still haven't developed a single kingside piece, while black is all set to start brawling! yes, i do have some advantage in the form of space and mobility, but that kingside is already causing me plenty of grief. this may not be the most accurate move in the position; in general i should keep the f-pawn fixed on f2 in order to keep my kingside as sturdy as possibly. now, i will have to be on a constant lookout for bad things that might happen on h4 and f2. but on the plus side, this does give me more space on the kingside, making it a bit more difficult for black to start something there, and it anchors the bishop while denying e5 for the enemy knight. black can hardly afford to trade the bishop, as 7...nxe5 8.fxe5 ne8 (where else?) looks pretty awful for him.   kicking my bishop away while opening lines of development for his own lsb. throughout the whole game black remains very conscious of the safety of his king. though this move may feel a bit excessive (i have hardly any threats in that direction yet), the point here is just as much to create some 'luft' (air) around the king (thus preventing 8th rank mates), as it is to take away control of g5 from white. this makes it a very useful waiting move in many positions, and indeed you will want to do something like this relatively early in the game, for you will often find that it is far too late to do this once things actually starts heating up! if you play through some grandmaster games from the last 20 years or so, you will find that this kind of move is very common quite early in the game! so, pay heed and remember this - give your king a bit of 'luft' to avoid finding him strangled later on ... well, that pawn needs to move somewhere or the bishop on f1 is never going to go away ... and this does create a rather impressive center presence! on the other hand, if you pointed out that my center is actually a bit shaky (those 4th rank pawns have little or no actual support) and that black's position is quite solid, you would be quite correct in that too ... a good tip: always move your rooks so they can take advantage of open and half-open files. like black is doing here. the proper response! black is challenging my center - but only *after* ensuring the safety of his own king. doing it earlier would have been a mistake, as i might then have used my advantage of space of mobility to threaten his king and win additional tempi - and more force to my attack. now the tables are nicely turned - my king is still in the center and finding himself more and more exposed by every move ... i have neglected the safety of my king and now i am starting to pay the price. opening the e-file, with that rook pointing straight down the throat of my exposed king, would be sheer suicide now. 12.exd5 bb4+ 13.kf2 (13.kd1 re1#) 13...qe7 14.qc1 bc5+ 15.d4 nxd4 and things just go downhill from there... too little, too late. the gk analysis engine gives black a rather impressive +2 pt advantage here, based purely on the positional aspects of the position (meaning: my exposed king!) or rather, after this move - which is a blunder quite in its own right - black's advantage is actually more like 4½ pt! (due to lines like 12.ne2 ndb4 13.axb4 nxb4 14.qc3 nxd3+ 15.kd1 nxb2+ etc.) luckily for me he misses this - though, more to the point, so do i too or i would have moved 12.nf3 instead! the idea behind the ne2 move is rather simple: i need to shield my king from that rook on e8, and now the knight has to move away from d5. it still would have been better to do nf3 followed by be2 however, as then i could at least have castled ... which would really have proven a big, big help later on! so, notice how f2 is really, really weak now that the f-pawn has moved away to f4? like it's a great, big, ugly, gaping hole in my kingside position!? well, that's what happens when you move those f-pawns away and then allow your king to just stand there ... ok, threatening mate now ... that's better, yes? means i have finally equalized and can forget about that pesky king-being-all-exposed thing? well, yes. kind of. but only because black really missed his big chance after 12.ne2 ... and though i do get some rather active play against the weakness in his own kingside now (namely: the long diagonal pointing straight at g7), that just means that for now the position is roughly even. if my king had been tucked safely away, as it ought to have been, i could have claimed a solid lead ... creates a new weakness on g3 and weakens h4 even more. but it does have the advantage of taking away g4 from the enemy knight - as long as he does not simply sacrifice it and follow up with tactics based on the h4 check! more things to worry about and keep track of ... it is quite possible that simply castling long would have been significantly better, all in all: that at least would have brought the king away from the threats on the e-file and activated the rather moribound rook on a1 (with the additional bonus of actual threats against black's queen too). ... though moves like this was exactly the reason why i decided to let the king stay put on e1 just a little while longer. if white had some pawns in place on , say, a2 and b2, then castling long would have been a no-brainer. as it is, a long castle would simply exchange an extremely unsafe position for a very shaky one: better, but not really good. in for a penny, in for a pound ... the gk analysis lets black do this without even hinting at any questionmarks... which might seem awfully odd considering that i can now fork his knight and bishop simply by moving e5! but guess what? those holes and weaknesses around my king - the consequence of stupidly letting him stay put in the center - they make the whole idea impossible! 17.e5? nd5! 18.qc2 qh4+! 19.kd1 ne3+ and i might as well resign. but now, surely i must be able to fork something! i have two (2!) potential forks going: e5 and d5. he cannot possibly escape them both ... right. instead he can do this. and now 18.exd5 bxd5 19.o-o-o bxh1 20.d5 qf6 (forced or mate on g7) 21.qxf6 gxf6 22.dxc6 bxc6 would mean playing against his pair of bishops in a very open position - which would clearly favour him. and now i stumble a bit. gk correctly flags this as an 'inaccuracy' and gives this, very instructive line as the alternative. it's probably not entirely correct (the gk analyses gets less precise towards their end), but the general idea is clear - and it shows again very clearly the consequences of having literally no protections in place around the king: here it let's black get out of what would otherwise have been a hopeless bind. 19.bg2 na5 20.d5 bd7 21.e5 nxd5 22.qxd5 bc6 23.qxa5 bxg2 24.exd6 bxh1 25.dxc7 qh4+ 26.kd1 qxh3 aiming for a material bonus to offset my positional disadvantages. a general tip: do try to avoid placing the queen on an open file with the king behind her and an enemy rook in front ... those things are bound to cause grief - which is precisely why black chooses to let his knight capture here rather than on, say, d5. the bishop on e6 is untouchable, as 21.dxe6 qxd2+ would make my position (even more) awful. and 21.axb4 is also firmly in no-go land after 21...bxd5 22.qc2 bxh1 23.qc3 f6 where i may have achieved material equality but is strategically lost. this, on the other hand, is even worse ... considering how this ends, i really do think i should just have captured on b4 immediately. the reason i didn't: those three pawns on his queenside were just going to roll down and squash me then, considering that i haven't a shread of shielding in front of my king over there on the queenside. finally deciding to sacrifice the rook in order to get the king away from that e-file. black is at +2 materially, and plus something innumerable strategically. gk evaluates his advantage to +2.75, but that is definitely too low. i could just as well have resigned here, as the total lack of (pawn) protection for my king, coupled with those open d- and e-files and the linked queenside phalanx of pawns, ensures black an easy victory. neatly removes the most efficient piece remaining to me. both knights were pinned. sacrifices a pawn to open the b-file. capturing here is suicidal as the open b-file directly next to my exposed king means mating threats will now come quick and thick. but on the other hand, i cannot ignore the coming avalance either... the coup-de-grace, utterly isolating the king from my remaining pieces. a neat, very direct and totally deserving defeat. i violated several tenets in this game, and most importantly: i began operations against black *before* ensuring the safety of my king. i will take pain to avoid doing so in the future! 
-------------------------------------
de caro-kann-defense, een verrassende openingskeus van chris.  voor het eerst, terwijl toch een geschiedenis van 22 jaar onderlinge partijen hebben.  die partijen hadden maar al te vaak een beslissend karakter.  maar nu zo vroeg in het seizoen niet. en dat geeft ruimte om wat nieuws te proberen. (chris: klopt, caro-kann speel ik eigenlijk niet. meestal russisch.) . alternatieven voor chris zijn e6 of pbd7/ waarna de loper op g6 meestal wel geslagen wordt en de strijd ook nog lang is. de positie de dameloper vond ik in deze partij een lastige. lf4 kan wellicht ook. lg5 lijkt me minder zinvol omdat de loper met h6 toch verjaagd wordt. ld2 maakt de lange rochade mogelijk voor wit en leek me daarom een goed idee. ……………. le7 is chris zijn prima antwoord. gezonde ontwikkelingszet. dit leek me voor chris niet de beste voortzetting.  ik pareer de aanval op f2 snel met de2, wat, gezien de druk op e6 een betere plek is voor de grande dame. ( chris: ik wilde wit op het verkeerde been brengen. na 11. .. -  pg4, 12. de2 - pdf6. helaas durfde ik het niet aan. angst voor de tegenstander?) is dit de beste opzet voor mij? nu ik het na kijk twijfel ik weer. op h3 staat het paard later niet goed. ik heb veel moeite om hem weer in het spel te brengen. het idee was om dat via f4 en d3 te doen. daar komt niets van terecht. ( chris: hier moest ik goed uitkijken. 13.pg5 -h6! jan kon nu niet offeren: (14pxe6? -fxe6. 15.dxe6 - pf8! en wit moet terug.)) de chess.com analyse zegt nu ook dat ik slechter sta. maar gelukkig is chess.com geen chris.com chris durft na  f4 de korte rochade niet meer aan. interessant om eens na te spelen, niet echt goed te overzien chess.com is nu iets minder verdrietig over mijn stelling en geeft c4 aan als beste zet. dat durf ik alleen niet met mijn koning op c1  ik heb een heel ander plan: aanvallen op de andere vleugel. natuurlijk keurt de computer mijn plannen volstrekt af. chris verliest een tempo met ld6 denk ik. hij moet opletten op de dreiging c2-c4-c5 met mogelijke  stukwinst. chris pareert met 19.   lb4, maar nu geeft chess.com een interessant idee voor hem: 19… c5!  of als alternatief 18… pf6 waarna c4 niet meer op gaat.  (chris:  nu ik de analyse bekijk had ik idd. c5! moeten spelen. opnieuw het niet durven. achteraf is het zo simpel…..) zetten als  19…..p4d5 of 19.  p6d5 20. dxa7 geeft een hoopmooie verwikkelingen. nu staat ook chris z’n paard in de hoek. maar hij komt er straks heel snel weer uit…. het vuurwerk begint. chris antwoordt met de doorschuif 22….. e5 een tijdelijk pionoffer.  ( chris: toch had ik hier g6 moeten spelen. zo krijg ik druk op de g-lijn! slaan was niet  de sterkste voortzetting.) chris staat een pion voor. maar ik heb de f-lijn. is td7 hier een alternatief? of pd5? ik krijg nu wel een heel mooie aanval voor de (tijdelijk) geofferde pion pd5? nu kan al 26. txf7?! en wit kan de toren niet slaan op f7 vanwege dame verlies na pd6+. deze zet zag ik echter pas later wint de pion terug had ik nu niet even 28. a3 moeten doen om de tegenaanval er uit te halen? nu zag ik wel dat ik de pion op f7 kan hebben omdat chris niet terug kan slaan op f7 vanwege pxd6+ met damewinst, maar ja, net te laat, daar komt de tegenaanval al aan en nu moet ik er wel meteen iets aan doen de bom onder mijn koningsstelling, briljant van chris! want nu te doen? na kd2 kom ik waarschijnlijk niet goed weg, chris heeft talrijke goede voortzettingen. ik moet mijn koning wel laten insluiten en bidden dat ik chris zijn offers levend doorsta….. (chris:  (31… - dxc3 gaat net niet op. jan heeft de tijd om de dreiging db6, db2 en mat te ontwijken. namelijk: 32. ka1 - db6, 33.tb1!) phiieeewwwww, ik kom er mee weg…. heeft chris geen betere alternatieven? nu zie ik ze niet meer jawel, daar de zet die op zet 26 al had gekund toch (chris:hier stond ik verloren. dus maar een wanhoopspoging proberen...) nou wordt ik weer nerveus, hoewel mijn stelling prachtig is. en mijn volgende zet is daarom niet zo goed (chris:ik ontspring de dans! op deze schaakzet volgde nog kd2, niet ke1 zoals hier staat aangegeven. ) . en hier nam ik, moegestreden, een remise aanbod aan van chris. nu naar de stelling  kijkend, denk ik dat ik mijn koning er wederom onder uit had kunnen draaien en nog steeds winstkansen had in het eindspel met de ijzersterke g- en h-pionnen, maar, ja met weinig bedenktijd na een intensieve avond. (chris:er volgde na 40. ..-da4+ nog: 41. kd2? - dc2+, 42 ke3 - de2+ ik bood remise aan, net als jan moe gespeeld. bovendien was er zeer weinig tijd over gebleven. minder dan 10 minuten.  ik had nog kunnen proberen: 42. … - de2+, 43 kd4 - td8!. vooral dan niet kxc4??wegens d2 aftrekschaak. misschien had ik door moeten spelen. in ieder geval was dit een zeer spectaculaire partij.) 
-------------------------------------
e5 zet de partij op scherp. ik weet niet of 7. ….pg4 8.h3 ph6 een alternatief voor zwarts’ paardzet is. onduidelijk, wordt een heel ander spel.  alternatief voor wit is om aan te sturen op een lange rochade met 8. h3, gevolgd door 9. le3 en 10. dd2.  db6 creëert een tegendreiging, 13…. pxe5. voor de volgende zet van wit, df2 is geen goed alternatief  a5 moet wel, het net om de dame sluit zich na  bijvoorbeeld 14….tad8, 15. a5 db4 16. ta4. alternatief is bijvoorbeeld 14…. c5, 15. a5 dc6  b3 gooit de diagonaal g7 – a1 open. dus had chris kunnen denken aan een offer: 15.  ….pxe5! 16. dxe5 dxf2 17. k x f2 18. l x e5 l d2 met goede compensatie voor zwart  had zwart hier niet beter de gevaarlijke loper op d3 kunnen ruilen? met dit stuk krijgt hij later een hoop last….  de laatste zet van zwart maakt de weg vrij voor de aanval op f7 kh1 moet! want pxe5! dreigt na meteen pf4. de vraag is of pf8 niet een betere zet is voor zwart als het gespeelde dd8? eerst verhinderen dat de loper op d3 wordt afgeruild de verwikkelingen na de alternatieve verdediging 23…. pf8  zijn complex. nog eens naspelen het paard offer dat de partij beslist 26… pf8 of pf6 helpt niet meer, 27. tf1 x paard 1-0 analyse jan brinkman. 
-------------------------------------
iedereen slaat hier op d4, hier gaat herman direct uit de theorie van de siciliaanse opening slaan op c5 voelt niet goed omdat herman de zwarte loper op f8 direct in de aanval zet op c5. wat dan. doorschuiven naar d5 of e5? ik maak een andere keus en het bord gaat in brand..….  alle andere zetten verliezen direct een pion kijk eens naar alternatieven als dxb2, de pion lijkt erg giftig. of pd5 of pe4 het alternatief d x a1 lijkt niet echt verantwoord vanwege 9. pb3, dxa2 en 10. fg7 zwart kan zelfs denken aan doorslaan met de dame omdat ta1 dan valt, maar waarschijnlijk brengt dit niet genoeg voor zwart. met deze zet blijft zwart een pion voor en haalt hij de dreiging pb5 uit de stelling was hier voor wit direct dh5 een alternatief geweest? en dan daarna le2 of tb3? nu is het verschil dat mijn koning wel veilig achter 3 pionnetjes staat en die van herman niet. dat biedt mogelijkheden… slaan op c4 lijkt haast verplicht omdat anders ld2 weg moet en de dames geruild worden. waarna het aanvalsvuur van het bord  is en ik gewoon een pion achter sta. hoewel zwart wel moet uitkijken met deze dameruilvariant, stel 16. lc1 d xd1. 17. pxd1 pe5 18. tg3, dan kan herman net zijn loper op g7 redden tegen dreiging lh6 dreigt dameruil op g4 na het sterke f5 van herman haalt h3 haalt dg4 en het eventuele mat achter de paaltjes uit de stelling en lijkt een nuttig zetje een mooie zet, waardoor de zwarte dame uit haar isolement wordt verlost en mee kan gaan verdedigen tegen de op handen zijnde aanval op hermans’ koning. ik heb echter na lang nadenken nog een lastige wending voor herman. feitelijk is dit een verzwakking van herman’s stelling, maar de alternatieven verliezen mionimaal een kwaliteit . het kwaliteitsoffer. d x g7 gaat nu niet want na lc3 staat de dame gepend de grote vraag. had ipv td1 hier dh8 gekund? volgens mij slaat het niet door, ik raak ook door mijn tijd heen en daarom haal ik er met td1 een extra aanvaller bij en verhoog ik de druk op d6. herman besluit de kwaliteit terug te offeren	 en hier werd tot remise besloten analyses jan brinkman. 
-------------------------------------
frans! dat zie ik bij herman niet vaak. was altijd meer iets wat je tegen de breimers kon verwachten. dreigt pf5 met 3-dubbele aanval op d4. hoe kan wit dit pareren. het programma waarmee ik deze partij analyseer geeft zetten als 9. pc3 (9…. pf5 10. pa4 dd8 11 a3) of 9 pa3 of 9 dd3 pf5 10. td1 tc8 11 pc3 en het kan nog alle kanten op. maar ik doe een zet die ik tegen het frans vaker gespeeld heb: ?!? de analyser is natuurlijk niet positief over mijn zet en ziet meteen allerlei varianten waarbij wit slecht komt te staan, bv 9. …  h5 of 9….. tc8 of 9…. tb8 met nog enigszins gelijk spel. maar dat doet herman allemaal niet: nemen op c5 lijkt nu voor herman niet de beste optie, … lc5 15. txc5 pa5 16 txc8 lxc8 17. h4 h5 met toch wel prettig spel voor wit. dus doet herman en nou komt het spektakel volgens chris heeft jan hier winst laten liggen. 17 dxe5 lxc5 18 txc5 txc5 en nu is 19 dd4 winnend zwart blijft nu een pion voor maar moet nog wel uitkijken want dc8+??  is achteraf dc6 niet beter? of a4? herman pareert nu de aanval pb6 kan ook nu heeft herman goede mogelijkheden om te consolideren met bv pb8 of bxa4 maar hij besluit tot een offer dat ik niet zag aankomen en wel moet aannemen: remise op voorstel van wit. heel onduidelijk hoe dit afloopt als we wel doorspelen. de eenzame maar vrije b- pion kan snel gaan lopen, ondersteund door mijn sterke c-lijn, maar de extra loper zal al snel nodig zijn om de aankomende pionnen stormloop af te slaan. na de remise verschillende varianten doorgerekend, en duidelijk was het niet. 
-------------------------------------
vorige keer vergat ik tegen frans deze zet en kwam al snel in de problemen na lb5. daarom nu wel … met zijn laatste 2 zetten wijkt frans feitelijk af van de theorie van de siciliaanse verdediging, waarin wit door gaat met zetten als le3. voor mij pakt dit goed uit zwart heeft nu een mooie stelling en kan de aanval door het centrum gaan voorbereiden te3 is effectief tegen de zwarte aanval op h3, a5 snoert de witte damevleugel verder in pd7 is een noodzakelijke opzet voor de opstoot d6-d5, vanwege 13….d5? 14. exd5 c xd5. 15 txe5 en vervolgens 15…. ld6 brengt niet genoeg aanval voor de verloren pion. e5 moet dus eerst gedekt worden en pd7 is daarvoor een mogelijkheid. dc7 kan ook. bij de witte zet pe2 heb ik wel twijfels. moet het paard niet op c3 blijven en  13. lf1 lijkt dan beter? 16….e4!! dwingt de ruil op e7 af. van lc6!! schrok ik wel. d5 is na f5 een zwakte geworden.  reken het allemaal maar eens uit na 20. lxa8 fxe3 21. lxd5 exf2 + 22. kf1.  nu niet 21 …lxh3, want dan wordt de dame geruild via dxd5+. zwart heeft nu alle tijd, ondanks de geofferde kwaliteit 22. kf1 is misschien een alternatief? 25. fxe3 is waarschijnlijk geen goed alternatief.  de dameruil moet vanwege de dreigingen dg3 en df2. ondanks de kwaliteit minder zijn de doorgebroken centrumpionnen nu bepalend voor zwarts winst is c3 een mogelijkheid voor wit om tegenspel te geven? zwart heeft dan in elk geval d3 te2 ipv kf1 faalt op pd2 + met stukwinst via pxb1 wit geeft op. commentaar jan brinkman.

  1. ...... c5 - well, that was how the game ended but we go back to the present with bob playing his trusty sicilian defense. 2. b3 - as the game is unrated i decided to try an unusual line here - this is intended to counter a possible fianchetto of bob's dsb on the a1-h8 diagonal. 3. bb2 - fou lenoir occupies that diagonal as planned. 6. nxd4 - the traditional scicilian pawn trade on d4 ensues. 9. bd3 - steady development. 12. qxf3 - knight trade. 14. qd3 - glenda eyes up the h7 square longingly.  unfortunately there is a black knight.  e5 will not do as i will simply drop the pawn to dxe5. 16. ....... qc6?? - both players have been playing fairly faultlessly until now.  i am planning a kingside attack and at the same time trying to prevent henry copping old matey on the g2 square - i see real danger in the line up of the wicked witch and her partner in crime the lsb on that a8-h1 diagonal.  gameknot identified this move as a blunder and this sparks off a series of blunders and mistakes on both sides.  blunder: +3.13 » … qc6 16. nd5 bd8 17. bxf6 gxf6 18. e5 f5 19. exd6 qc5 20. d7 rc6 21. rg3+ kh8 22. qc3+ f6

si bien es perfectamente jugable, tal vez intecalar 4.., c5 darías más opciones a las negras. el orden elegido por el campeón de arica fue empleado con asiduidad en el match kaspárov-kárpov. las negras aprovechan su leve ventaja de desarrollo para acosar al caballo de "c3". en varias lineas las blancas se quedan con peón de menos, alfredo se decide por la aparentemente única opción: simplificar. ¿esto era necesario? la alternativa era 9 ad2, donde habría que evaluar la "eterna" clavada del caballo. las negras arden por abrir lineas. d5 se ve como una posibilidad grata, así como cc6, colocando énfasis en el abandono de las casillas negras por el corcel de las blancas. ¡me pican las manos por sacrificar algo! veamos: 9.., d5; 10 cd, ed; 11 dd5, td8 con idea de ad4 y luego tomar de torre... el tema del mate en octava tal vez no se logre, pero en dos jugadas ¡todas las piezas negras juegan! bueno, sigamos con la partida. el tema es que ahora la dama queda tocada si se sacrifica un peón.. ok, pareja de alfiles y peón aislado, pero me sigue preocupando el tema del rey en el centro. además, siento que la dama blanca no se quedará tranquila en la columna c echándole un ojo a "e2" los enredos favorecerán al bando mejor desarrollado, tal vez es tiempo de mejorar la ubicación del rey, pero la posición no es del todo tranquila, ag4 y tc8 son algunas ideas bastante claras para las negras. ansioso tal vez, alfredo no duda en cambiar las damas haciendo caso al viejo adagio que el peón aislado es más débil en el final.  ¡genial! ahora tenemos la columna c, pero el caballo se mostrará bien activo. interesante parece 18.., af5 si 19 e4, de4; 20 tc2, e3 y el peón en séptima es respetable. el caballo de todas maneras tiene una misión importante en b3, además ataca al débil "b5" un descuido que pudo haberle costado el punto más pronto de lo que ocurrió al blanco. la posición no es del todo clara, pero todo parece estar en la jugada 18 tc1, la torre se presta actualmente para todos los caprichos del corcel negro. un descuido que pudo haberle costado el punto más pronto de lo que ocurrió al blanco. la posición no es del todo clara, pero todo parece estar en la jugada 18 tc1, la torre se presta actualmente para todos los caprichos del corcel negro. 19.., cb3! si 20 td5, td5; 21 ad5, cd2; 22 re1, af5 el rey blanco sigue siendo tema. 19.., tc2 pierde después 20.., af5; 21 e4, de4; 22 ae3, td1; 23 re2, ag4.  nuevamente, af5 era la jugada 22.., tc8 se encontraba con ac3. le pone zapatillas al peón

this is a series of the best matches in a mini tournament of the orangutan opening orangutan opening this is nice start for black, most common is to exchange the pawns with the bishop white didn´t see a more concentrated attack on the king side but have a goog plan?? i dont think this is good but the plan keeps going anunciated going for castle breaking, note bb3 in a great position pull attack double threat on f2! he blocks the queen but now theres no turning back this is a massive attack, pictoric takes rook, knight can take black rook but its too late abismal checkmate, is been said that in orangutan op, savage attacks are usually seen, well lets see, thank you! 
-------------------------------------
this was part of a semi-slav thematic mini. the starting position can be found at black's fourth move. the starting position. white heads for a probable meran. the meran variation. this is a very heavily analysed variation, and both sides are following mainline theory until about move 14. the current main line. alternatives are the aggressive e4 or the quiet a3. a major choice point; the main alternative is nd4. black departs from theory (15 ...qxe5, usually leading quickly to an endgame). the text is an idea of shirov's, virtually forcing f3 and clogging up white's lines of attack. delaying white's attack down the e-file, and freeing c5 for a bishop or queen check. be7 is another interesting possibility here.  i was expecting 21 qxe5, whereupon qc4  is a way of easing the pressure. the beginning of a very risky plan which in the end did not succeed. black tries to break white's king's position open by marching this loose pawn down the king's side, while white's major pieces queue up to attack his uncastled king! the problem is that taking the e5 pawn does not get white far, e.g. qxe5 qxe5, rxe5  kd7, and white is at risk of a strong attack from black's bishops and h8 rook. the move played stops black castling and makes the threats to his king more serious. white thought about this move for some time, but it seems to be correct. 24 qxe6 qxe6, 25 rxe6  kd7, the rook must move and bc5  seems to be winning. alternatively 24 rd1 bc5  and again black has fg with check. bc5  is answered by 25 be3. the text is intended to deprive white of this possibility.  25 qxc5 bxc5  and black has time to castle, and then it is white's king's position that looks precarious. obviously aiming at h2, but there are tactical risks to black as well. allowing rxh2 . i had seen this tactic earlier but taken my eye off the ball. 33´...rg8 fails to 34 nf6 . the idea here was 34 nxg5 rxh2, 35 nxf3 rxb2 and white's king is cut off on the second rank. liquidating the pawns gives black a chance of holding a r v r n (or r v r b) pawnless ending. ...but white doesn't want any of that. of course not 36 ...a4?, 37 nd4 ! ra8 or re8  would have been better.  the idea was to seize the chance of crossing the e-file and getting to the g-pawn. but then i changed my mind, fearing penetration by the white king. indecisive play with a heavy price. several moves too late to be effective. still hoping to liquidate the pawns and  to reach and hold a cochrane position. black cannot stop white defending this last pawn by bd6-c5. what can i say? :-( 1-0 
-------------------------------------
he starts conventionally. i reply with my usual. the sicilian is the most popular and best-scoring response to white's first move 1.e4.  he plays a dangerous sideline. if black is not careful white builds up an overwhelming king side attack. 2.f4 is the grand prix attack or mcdonnell attack: the latter name stems from the 14th match game played in london in 1834 between alexander mcdonnell and charles louis mahé de la bourdonnais, won by black. according to jeremy silman and others, black's best reply is 2...d5 3.exd5 nf6!, the tal gambit, which has caused the immediate 2.f4 to decline in popularity. white may decline the gambit with 3.nc3, called the "toilet variation", so named after its reputed place of invention. a less common option is 2...e6, as la bourdonnais played against mcdonnell. players usually enter the grand prix attack nowadays by playing 2.nc3 first before continuing 3.f4. the modern main line runs 2.nc3 nc6 3.f4 g6 4.nf3 bg7. here white can play the positional 5.bb5, threatening to double black's pawns with bxc6, or the more aggressive 5.bc4, aiming for a kingside attack. i think it is best to strike in the center immediately to stop this build up. so he takes. i play this, rather than taking with the queen and allowing him to develop his knight to c3, attacking the queen with gain of time. this is a bot like a centre counter opening, except white has played f4 and black has played c5. white calmly develops. trying to hang onto the pawn with c4 or bb5 don't lead to any advantage for white if black plays correctly. i played this, as i was afraid that if i took on d5 then the bishop check on b5 was strong. checking on opening databases now, i see i was wrong to fear this, and simply nxd5 was best, although a6 was successfully played in elduderino1 (1712) vs. tjbuege (1779), which continued with  5. bc4? b5 6. bb3? c4 7.	bxc4	bxc4 and black is piece for a pawn up. but my opponent doesn't fall for that. so i take back. the pawn on f4 was attacked and this uncovers protection from his bc8. protecting my pawn on c5. attacking it again. protecting it again. he hits my knight. i retreat. i chose this square, as i didn't want to give him time to play d4-d5. he takes. i take back, and notice how he can't play d4-d5 now. notice also how we have both played 9 moves, moving only knights and pawns. we both seem to have taken the advice "knights before bishops" to extremes! i think this is a mistake, simply be2 was better. the position is open, so it is better to have bishops than knights. it would have been better for him to retreat the bishop to g1.  so i take it off. he takes back. preparing either a nasty check on a5 with my queen or b4 with my bishop. my computer suggests that white should have delayed recapturing with qd2, rather than allow the checks. now black has a choice of tasty checks. which one would you chose and why? i thought this was the stronger check, although my computer prefers bb4. this move is horrible. nd2 was perfectly playable. i did look at 14.....bd7 now (the move my computer recommends), but i didn't like the look of lines like 15. rd1 0-0-0 16. ne5. i also wanted to develop my bf8 with tempo, but didn't want my g7 pawn falling. eventually i decided on a move which prepares bc5 and also stops his knight from coming in to e5. which was this. he develops. computer agrees this is best for white and gives the position as about equal. i develop. computer prefers bc5. computer eventually plays this, after considering 16. bh3, although i was looking at this and thinking black had after qh5, 17. bg2 bc6 and i was really liking black's position. neutralizing the bishop. computer still prefers bc5. computer prefers 17. qe3. i was looking at this and thinking that if so, i could just play kf7 (computer prefers bd7). i was thinking after 18. nd4 bxg2 19. qxe6+ i could escape the checks by marching my king to h6. however after kg6 20, qg4 kh6?? white has nf5+! winning the black queen. so in this variation it seems best is just to allow the perpetual check.  i develop my bishop with tempo. computer prefers exchanging queens, but it is surely better to keep the queens on, with his king still stuck in the middle. he attacks my pawn on e6. and i just calmly castle. computer prefers 0-0-0, but surely my king is safer here. it is too dangerous to accept the pawn, so he hits my bishop. i attack his queen. he offers the exchange of queens again. computer prefers qc1. i of course refuse. computer prefers exchanging still. he hits my bishop. i attack his queen with gain of time. computer prefers rf-d8, although it is surely better to move the a rook, keeping the other rook for the f or e file. so the queen runs away. and i attack his rook. the rook moves. i want to open up the e file. he foolishly ignores my threat. i thought at the time f4-f5 was the best move for him, trying to keep the king side closed. computer likes 24. fxe5, but i like my position after i recapture on e5 with the pawn, as i also have the open f file. i open the e file. i think this is best, although computer likes ba4. white recaptures. i like this move, although computer prefers the straightforward rf-e8+ computer actually prefers giving up the queen for two rooks with 26. rxd8 - black is clearly winning now. black as several horrible threats. white tries to reduce black's attacking potential, but to no avail. i just take back. as good as anything, the position is lost. clearly winning. ok, stop and find black's next move. did you see it? it is mate soon! see http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=167742  many thanks for reading this annotation. please leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing, and rate the annotation on the star system. until next time dear reader!

nxc6 better, developing a knight. but, too late now... ? this loses a rook due to the pin along the h1-a8 diagonal. ! now black has to think smart. ??? caught in the centre. now he is doomed! a sweet tactic here. i excitedly move my rook to e1 and exclaim to kai: “thanks for the queen. greatly appreciated.” ?? could have regained the piece! mate around the corner. checkmate! hope you enjoyed! tied for first in the tournament, i played linus in the final game and won the trophy! these opponents were not hard to beat, but not easy, either. stick around for some more otb and regular game annotations. 
-------------------------------------
this seems to win the knight. however, qa4+!? doesn’t due to n8c6!! and d5 fails to nxd5. ? this just loses a pawn! now this wins a knight because the white queen is guarding d5! ! better was rb8 threatening mate easily. this is usually spotted, however arjun didn’t! ??????????? mate! i won an easy tournament game. i played 3 more games. being the highest rated player in the tournament, i was favoured to win and played 3 more games. let’s see if i won... 
-------------------------------------
my opponent starts normal. i continue with the king pawn opening. four knights game! i never play this as white unless i use the rule of the fork, a tactic for when people play 3... bc5 i continue with 4. nxe5 nxe5 d4! which forks the knight and bishop. he could play nxe5 now, but i don’t think he knew the trick. this is asking for bg4! ruins the kingside. this is fine - as long as he does not castle kingside. ?? now i punish him for this. ?? this sacrifices a bishop for a pawn! i am at +2 and a winning kingside! now, we see me storming through raj’s defences! !? now at +5. touch move. this is a blunder, but raj touched his king and didn’t have anywhere to move it. mate in 2. checkmate. my second tournament game won! 
-------------------------------------
queen pawn opening. i don’t like queen’s gambit as black, so i played this to prevent that. this position is like slav defence, but with black going first! i figured white would probably lose tempi if i did this... and this is how. it was touch move. lost another tempo. teehee! ! oh, guarding. still doesn’t work. !? isolating the pawn ore. challenging the e-file. that was another reason f5 would not be a great move for white. rook endgame. +6!! sacrifice. accepted  threatening mate, so white resigns.

i’m pretty sure it’s called the scotch opening die queen. aiming at f7. pinned teehee check oh well, i think better was bxf6. stopping doubled pawns  die you stupid bishop die you other stupid bishop ? teehee better was nxb5 oh well trades thought against ke7 after a while die knight castling kingside die knight die rook trades, i am +1 ! rxe5 and white is busted distraction threat preparing raf8 forced trade, game close here and whites pawns are soon to be killed, so my opponent nathan resigned... 
-------------------------------------
? rips open the centre while uncastled. my first mistake. touch move! this bishop move is meaningless, probably inaccurate. kartic’s first mistake. preparing o-o, hoping re1 doesn’t happen soon. whew! huh, low on development and blocking the c3 square, perfect for the knight. completing my development. the meaning of c3 kind of becomes clear now. not trading my good bishop for his horrible one, but placing it on a worse square. dude, you need more development! 4 lsb moves! 6 now open file taken ?? asking for trouble. his 3rd mistake(2nd being moving his lsb too many times). preparing a simple checkmate along the h2-b8 diagonal. preparing dsb development (finally!) better probably was bxh3 ?? didn’t see the masked battery. ?? one of the final blunders. ??? hope you enjoyed! 
-------------------------------------
this is a game played by arthi and i, which i won. however, we both made blunders and it could have been a draw. enjoy! comments and ratings are welcome. i don’t like this, but either way i played boring kpo. what? ?? i am won. huh. better was qxe5+ i think. check  die!! ?? oops. oh no double oops. ?????? ???? white could have took the rook! trades. ?? yay. yay white resigns. yet another victory for me. 
-------------------------------------
since i was white the last time, i had to play as black.  interestingly enough, jack remembered that i played tom, but he wanted to know how many games.  and, if it was just one, which color.  so, i did the same thing that i do for an annotation by going over my notes.  in other words, i sort of, had to go over the score, but not with how many wins, etc.  but, for me, this score wasn't even about wins, but just the amount of games, and then who it was against and which color.  that's when i figured it out, and tom defeated me the last time as black.  interestingly enough, i know tom, and when i play as black, he often plays the kpo.  but, this time, he opted for the english opening. i hate to say it, but if i didn't study some of fiercequeen's annotations involving the english opening, i wouldn't have known what else to do besides this move.  of course, before that, i learned from ion, that this is, indeed, the most common response for the reason that i thought which is due to it being the reverse sicilian.  but, then where else do you go?  well, i was thinking in terms of what else goes into a normal sicilian and what i remembered from, "bonnie" as black. as this is how fiercequeen responded.  had i not studied that, however, i would've played this anyhow as it not only starts to develop, but e5 is attacked.  but, i'll hold off on taking the pawn for a short while. defending and continuing to develop. so, i go right after the n.  my idea is to exchange, as my thinking was winning a pawn.  it was later that i realized that this shouldn't have worked.  right now it doesn't, but there's a variation that i forgot about until we exchanged on c3 which was the only reason why i went forward with it, after 4.a3.  otherwise, i would've retreated with 4...bc5. as i was thinking in terms of 5...nxe4?! and had almost played it.  then i remember some variations where you attack the e file, as i noted in previous annotations.  but, it wouldn't have worked in those other annotations, but it would here.  and, it's based on what coach stockel taught me a long while back, and he wasn't wrong here.  on the other hand, i applied it in the wrong context, but that's not so here.  without the sleep, i might've forgotten it.  having said that, i remembered that 5...nxe4 allows 6.qe2 (this time around).  in order to avoid losing a piece, i have to retreat my ne4 which would not only hand back a pawn, but i would lose my right to castle.  that is, even if i were to exchange q's which is something that didn't occur.  the only way around it would be to delay it.  but, i wouldn't have done it anyway.  by delay castling, i mean move the k and r over in a few moves, as opposed to, one.  so, i'd be talking what happens after 6.qe2 nf6 then 7.qxe5+ qe7 8.qxe7+ kxe7, with a later idea of ...rh8-e8, followed by ...kf8, …"at some point", as charleshiggie puts it.  on the other hand, i would not be happy exchanging q's there because similar to ken, i'm thinking about what my queen could, potentially do later on. therefore, instead of going into all of the variations or just leaving the k out there and not exchanging, i decide to castle first.  as this move makes me feel comfortable about taking on e4.  the reason being is that if white responds with qe2 to win back a pawn, my k is already where it should be.  and, i'm not forced to exchange anything.  creating more mobility for his bc1.  but, i'm about to take, as noted earlier. ? but, this is a mistake which loses a pawn.  the irony is that i almost made a blunder which would've lost a piece.  and, that would've been an example of what jack calls, "a 2 second move".  maybe, tom thought that this won back a pawn, but best for tom would've been 7.qe2 which would've done just that. as noted a move ago, this is where i almost blundered which would've given tom the advantage, instead.  the reason being is that the only other move that i considered besides this was 7...nxc3??  in fact, this is what i almost played.  but, i then saw what comes after which would've been 8.qc2, trapping my n.  had i not stayed on the same schedule, this would've happened as it has before.  and, the irony is that i did this for work, but there's also chain reaction or chain of events where one things leads to another.  this is an example. continuing his development and going after my r.  i wouldn't see the point if tom was just attacking, his b is more mobile here then on b2. completing his development on the q side.  and, i would see the point, if tom were to castle long, but he didn't.  therefore, as far as, i'm concerned, his q is out before completing his development for no good reason since i don't have an immediate threat against him.  but, by doing this, i will not try to punish him for lack of development which will work this time around.  even if i couldn't win material, i would've opted for gain of either a tempo or two tempii. so, i start off with this move, as my plan isn't just to develop.  but, my aim is to pin tom's d3 pawn since his q is on the same diagonal.  and, despite continuing with his development, tom's next move allows that.  ? continuing with his development and preparing to castle, but this i thought was the losing blunder.  i didn't realize this, at the time until my next move.  having said that, best was to castle long because of what i'm about to do next which will still pick up another pawn, to say the least.  and, it's worth noting that i also would've overlooked my next move without the sleep.   were it not for his n on d4, i would've captured and placed him in check with my re8, instead, as that would've also gotten his q.  however, i assumed that i was now an entire piece up.  and, i know why, as i didn't overlook what tom could've done.  but, i had ghost vision thinking that, somehow, he was down by an additional piece then what i had calculated.  and, that's because i visualized another b, from the earlier fork. ?? having said that, this was the losing move by tom.  as complicated as the position is for him, 14.nxf5 which would've gotten a piece back right away.  and, even though in theory, i'd still win, this would be very hard for me.  even being well rested, there's a good chance that i'd go wrong somewhere which would allow a swindle.  depending on how complicated things would get, being that there's so much time left, there's a slight possibility that i'd lose on time.  but, there's a better chance that i'd miscalculate and allow a draw with an advantage with something like a stalemate or draw by rep.  when we get real complicated and complex, that's where i miscalculate, and i know that this is even where really experienced players would do this as well.  having said that, this not only leaves him more then a piece down without anything in return, but his ne2 is tied down which is going to allow me to win it starting on my next move. the idea being is that keeping in mind that his n's pinned, i used a similar strategy against tom that ken used against me in our second training game.  in that training game, i had an attacked piece defended once, so ken brought in a second attacker which won it.  it's a very similar story here because his ne7 was attacked once and defended twice.  so, i brought in a second attacker to keep not just his n, but q and k all tied down.  thus, even if he kept it the way it was to try to avoid losing material; it's only a matter of time before i'd be able to launch a devastating on his k side as i saw with bhidragon.  and, i was already starting to think of a strategy to do that. but, this move made things much easier for me since i'll just grab it, immediately. trying to avoid liquidation, but this allows me to grab his q.  right before i moved, tom realized what he had done, and wanted to take the move back.  i did not do it, but were this is a casual game, i would've allowed to go back.  however, we, more or less, have to follow tournament rules in jack's tournaments since it's practice for the real world. and, once i played this, tom resigned.  somewhere either by the middle or towards the end of the game; master nathan came in and was surprised at how well i played just from what he saw.  i told him that, unlike with previous games, including tournaments, i was well rested and had adequate sleep the night before.   and, that i did this by managing my time properly and staying on the same schedule.  and, i said that, ironically, i'm just doing this to stay awake at work to avoid getting fired for sleeping on the job.  nathan responded by saying, "hmm.  that sounds right."

hi everyone!  i joined a mt organised by charleshiggie  where all bar one of my opponents were experts.  it looked to be a tough tournament indeed.  my opponent actually held coach ion to a draw in another mt so it certainly looked as though i would be on the back foot.  however, something happened that was completely out of the blue.  read on to find out just what it was! 3. ……bb4+ - fou lenoir clears the decks for kingside castling. 5. qxd2 - bishop trade. 6. ….. d5 - contesting the centre. 8. …… nbd7 - development. 10. bd3 - white also develops. 12. …..ne4 - outpost. 13. …...ndf6 - sir lollabout goes to f6 to support his kingside colleague sir slugabout on e5 (ion kindly gave me some ideas on what names to give my horsies - sir slugabout is henry's knight on the kingside and sir lollabout belongs to glenda on the queenside). 14. ne5 - white returns the compliment. 16. …… dxe4 - a plethora of exchanges ensues and i lay a trap.  if qxp?? then white loses a piece by f6 on the next turn. 17. nc4 - of which white avoids. 18. …… bh7 - fou leblanc hides away on h7, but he will emerge later on, never you fear! 20. …… rd5 - out of the blue a seed starts to germinate in my mind.  as white has concentrated his pieces onto the queenside, king plutark has been left on his own.  time for glenda to seek his company. 21. ……. qh4 - like this! 23. axb5 - pawn trade. 24. ….. rg5 - over the last two moves after getting that queenside pawn skirmish out of the way i am now seriously making king plutark shiver in old matey's shadow.  the immediate threat is qxh3 as the g2 pawn is pinned. 25. …… bf5 - now fou leblanc joins the party. 26. nd6?? - ga indicates this as the losing move.  i now play bxh3 as gxh3 allows qxh3#. 27. …… qh5 - glenda backs off but never fear, she is eyeing up f3.  if she gets there king plutark will not have a prayer. 28. …… qf3 - after this move i announce #3 and i told my opponent that he did not have to play it out.  if you want to work out the mate then please give your answers to me in a pm.  as a result of this game, this particular humble pawn (jstevens1) has her own promotion to username jotheblackqueen (this may take a few days before it happens) as she has now claimed her first ever expert victory.   
-------------------------------------
this is an annotation i have done to help one of my friends improve. i will not embarrass the player by giving the name, nor, for that matter, help opponents of my friend with their preparation. it was played in an evening league over-the board game. black copies white's first move. white attacks e5. black defends e5. as a spanish opening or spanish game or ruy lopez, named after 16th-century spanish bishop ruy lópez de segura. black plays the morphy defence, 3...a6, which "puts the question" to the white bishop.  the bishop retreats, the most common move, although exchanging on c6 is quite playable. this is the classical defence deferred (deferred as 3....a6 and 4. ba4 are inserted. the classical defence is 3.....bc4 immediately) for a century it was believed that it was safer for black to place the bishop on e7, but it is much more active on c5. white can gain time after playing d4 as the black bishop will have to move, but this does not always seem to be as important as was once thought.  white sensibly castles, probably the best move, and certainly the most common. black attacks the white bishop. of course the only safe square. black sensibly continues to develop. this is playable, white simply protects the e pawn. this move has a drawish reputation. white doesn't have to worry too much about the attack on the e pawn while the black king is in the centre. the drawback with this move is that it rules out the c2-c3 followed by d2-d4 plan. white can play 7. c3 and just ignore the attack on e4, meeting 7....nxe4 with 8. d4, 8. qe2 or 7. bd5, but not, of course, 8. re1? bxf2! 7. d3 is also playable, planning to develop the bc1 and keeping c3 and d4 at a later date an option. white can also play 7. nxe5, meeting 7....nxe5 with 8. d4 or 7. a4, threatening 8. axb5. black continues to develop, perhaps with the idea of playing bc8-g4, perhaps followed by nc6-d4. white decides to rule that out, although there are other options such as  8. d3 bg4 9. h3 bh5 10. bg5 nd4 11. g4 were possible, although black can improve by exchanging on f3 with 9....bxf3 10. qxf3 nd4. 8. a4 is perhaps best, with perhaps  8. a4 na5 9. ba2 o-o 10. d3 c6 11. bg5 b4 12. ne2 qe7 13. ng3 h6 14. be3 bxe3 15. fxe3 a reasonable line for both sides. so 8. h3 is arguably a slight inaccuracy. black hopes to drive the nc3 away and then win the e4 pawn. the drawback of this move is that if white moves the knight to any square other than d5, then ....nf6xe4 can be met by bd5 forking knights on c6 and e4, for instance 9. na4 (better than nb1 or ne2) nxe4? 10. bd5 wins for white as, as well as attacking both knights the nc6 is threatened to be taken with check, and then the ra8 could go too. 9. bd5 also saves the pawn, play may continue 9....nxd5 10. nxd5 and although black has the two bishops, play is equal. the computer program fritz tells me that white does best to sacrifice a pawn here with 9. nd5, although i probably would not play that myself! white meets the attack with an attack on c6. not a bad idea, it is always a good idea to look for counter-attacking moves rather than just respond to opponent's threats, but, as we saw from the previous note, white had better options, so i would call this a mistake - white's first mistake. black of course protects the nc6, but probably better is bd7 as this move leaves the nc6 pinned against the black king, and therefore gives white more tactical chances. however in this game white fails to take advantage of this, and in the end the bishop on b7 plays an important part in the mating attack on the white king. fritz gives this as the second best move and prefers 10. d4, but i think white can be forgiven for not seeing all the tactical possibilities after 10. d4. i am sure i would play 10. nd5 myself too. black does the obvious capture, the move black has been aiming for, but it is actually a mistake! fritz tells me that white should now play 11. d4! with advantage, for instance 11.	d4	bxd4 12.	nxd4	exd4 13.	re1 winning the ne4 (13.....f5 can be met with 14. f3). we now see how crucial it was for black to protect the knight with bd7 rather than bb7. fritz actually gives as best for black after 11. d4! 0-0 12. dxc5 nxc5 and white has an extra bishop for two pawns - what should be a winning advantage. fritz gives as the second best move for white 11. qe1  this lets black keep the extra pawn. so the knight drops back. this is an excellent move by white, pinning the nf6. white does have full compensation for the lost pawn. black attacks the bishop. this is what i would have played, although fritz prefers taking with the bishop followed by 14. d4. black naturally recaptures. the doubled f pawns are now a weakness for black, and there are potential weaknesses on the white squares on the black kingside, on f5 and/or h5, but white is never given time to exploit this. the open g file also gives black attacking possibilies for his rook and this is exploited to the full. again, i probably would have played this, keeping the pin on the f pawn. fritz prefers other retreats to e3, d2 or even c1. fritz gives 14.....kf8 as best fritz still likes the plan of c3 followed by d4 to blunt the bc5, fritz gives the position as equal after 15. c3. fritz gives 15. kh2 as the second best move for white. fritz also like this move. targeting the pawn on h6, not a bad idea at all. fritz still likes 16. c3 or 16. bd5 to blunt the bb7. naturally black protects the pawn. black has now come up with the best move on 4 successive moves and now has an advantage of more than plus 1. presumably with the idea of ng4 attacking f6 and h6. not a bad idea. fritz prefers 17. kh1 or bd5. unfortunately for black, white finds a strong reply. this is a powerful counter, threatening to play 18...qxh6 and the 19....qxg2 mate. if, say 18.	ng4	h5 19.	nxf6	qxh3 20.	g3 is hopeless for white - black can simply take on h4 or move the nc6 to e7 to threaten mate on g2 again. bravo! white finds the best defence! but black finds the best move to keep the attack going. there is now a strong threat to g2, attacked by both bb7 and rg6. f3 is the only move to keep white in the game. this is plausible, blocking the g file, the problem is that the ng4 can be attacked. of course! the obvious move wins easily. black could have also won with 19....nf5 this allows a mate in two, but there wasn't anything much better, for instance 20. ne3 protects e3 but allows a mate in three -  20.	ne3	qxh3+ 21.	kg1	rxg2+ 22.	nxg2	qxg2# fritz gives as the best move f3, with advantage to black of over 6 - black position is dire. ok stop and find a mate in two. there is also another mate in 2 starting with bg2+ forced! there are now three mates in one. probably the prettiest, although rxg2 and qxg2 would also have done the trick. in my view white developed well and had full compensation for the lost pawn, but lost because white failed to find the plan of c3 and d4 blunting the b5. black played well managing to develop an attack against the white king, even though black never castled. it was one of those games where neither side moves their queen side rook. many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two, and rate the annotation on the star system, so i have an idea how i am doing. until next time, dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
mon ouverture classique avec les blancs cela devrait me permettre de pousser un des pions sur la 5e ligne.  je m'attend à voir bg2 au prochain coup.  pour ce genre d'ouverture, je pense que c'est mieux de sortir le fou du côté de la reine et non pas celui du côté du roi comme le font les noirs présentement.  sortir le fou en b2 permet une attaque subtile sur le pion en g7 (côté du roque).  je préfère avancer e5 pour limiter la sortie du fou et du cavalier. j'apporte une protection supplémentaire aux 2 pions, tout en préparant le roque. je ne m'attendais pas à ça.  je croyais voir bg3 ou nc6.  j'imagine que le but était de prévenir bg5. puisque les noirs n'ont pas joué bg4.  j'avance le pion pour l'empêcher. je me positionne pour le roque. j'ai hésité avant de jouer ce coup.  initialement je voulais roquer, mais j'ai finalement opté pour le pion en c4.  un échange de pion viendrait fragiliser la diagonale f7-d4 des noirs. l'échange se fait comme prévu. encore une fois, pas certain de comprendre ce coup.  je crois que la sortie du cavalier aurait apporté un bon support.  l'avance de tous les pions semble menaçant, mais cette menace est souvent facilement contrôlable. sortie du cavalier en c3 pour potentiellement couvrir e4 et f6. la poussé des pions se poursuit, mais je crois que toujours que la menace est seulement apparente. j'ai préféré rester sur cette diagonale pour faciliter la sortie de la reine. la poussé des pions se poursuit, mais s'affaiblie tranquillement.  les grosses pièces sont toutes derrières. ceci forcera un échange ou affaiblira la diagonale.  je peux facilement déplacer le cavalier si les noirs avance en b4. l'échange n'a pas eu lieu.   je déplace ne4 qui sera un atout en attaque. le roque est moins bénéfique, la protection des pions étant plus faible. bc2 sera un meilleur support à l'attaque. encore une fois j'aurais aimé roquer, mais j'ai décidé de stopper définitivement l'avance des pions de ce côté.  ceci empêchera la venue possible du cavalier sur d7 en c4. bon coup.  ce cavalier est bien positionné et je l'avais oublié... ceci est pour empêcher nc3 et prévenir l'avancement du pion b4 en c5 suite à un échange potentiel de cavalier. bon coup.  je crois que mon roque est foutu.  j'ai manqué ma chance à quelques reprises. le roque n'étant plus possible, je me concentre sur l'attaque.  le positionnement des pions noirs me font envisager un sacrifice potentiel pour créer une ouverture. les noirs ont probablement senti le sacrifice pour ouvrir.  kh7 vient compliquer les choses. le roque n'étant plus possible.  h4 me permet d'ouvrir la ligne pour sortir la tour. je crois que les noirs tentent de repousser l'attaque.   je peux prendre le pion "en passant", mais f6 est bien protégé par 5 grosses pièces.  je préfère donc me replier avec ng3, car je trouve que nd6 s'éloigne de l'attaque et risque d'être coincé là. 
-------------------------------------
una delle continuazioni più utilizzate della partita scozzese: il nero triplica l'attacco sul cavallo bianco, a scapito della velocità nello sviluppo dei suoi pezzi generalmente la mossa più comunemente giocata in questo caso è 6. c3 che difende il cavallo. la mossa 6. cb5 è insidiosa perché attacca subito il punto indifeso c7 lasciando l'alfiere in presa. quasi obbligata questo scacco ha più che altro lo scopo di aprire i pedoni dell'arrocco del bianco, costringendolo ad arroccare sul lato di donna. ovviamente, non si può, in seguito, prendere il pedone in e4 per l'attacco del cavallo in c7 con scacco e attacco alla torre nera la donna deve tornare a casa per difendere il pedone e' chiaro che dg4 del bianco attacca il pg7: nel database di gk si trovano, come continuazione per il nero, sia g6 che rf8, che g5. ho scelto quest'ultima perché forniva la maggior percentuale di vittorie per il nero continuo a seguire il database, che a questo punto dà il 100% di vittorie al nero ( ma sarà attendibile?? ) mossa di sviluppo del cavallo bianco ( anche questa nel db ) qui potevo scegliere tra la più ortodossa a6 e cf6: con questa mossa ha proseguito la partita marina brunello contro pepino enrico. mi sono detto: se l'ha giocata lei ...  ecco l'imprevisto: a dire la veirtà, marina brunello non ha arroccato, preferendo mantenere il re centralmente, ma spostando i pezzi sul lato di re per difenderlo. io, invece, preoccupato dei possibili sviluppi della manovra del bianco ho pensato bene (?) di arroccare, mettendo il mio re in grossi guai. era sicuramente preferibile tentare di arroccare sul lato di donna, sviluppando subito l'alfiere c8  ( magari in g4 ) e la donna, per esempio in e7, naturalmente dopo aver scacciato il fastidioso cavallo in b5 comincia già a sentire un po' di freddo, il mio re! un'ottima posizione per il cavallo, avamposto per l'altro cavallo in g4, appena possibile così si mette al sicuro il re! avevo pensato a mettere il re nell'angolo e, magari, portare le torri sulla colonna g, ma, pensando di poterlo fare più tardi,  non ne ho più avuto il tempo. ora il cavallo in f6 e sotto attacco e blocca la donna nera per la sua difesa. era indispensabile scacciare subito il cavallo in b5 e sviluppare la donna ... ... invece, ho giocato una mossa molto debole e passiva, togliendo anche un pezzo dalla zona di difesa del re il bianco comincia a spingere i suoi pedoni contro il re avversario. lasciando, però, un importante casa al cavallo nero che conquista spazio e attacca la donna bianca  ecco i due cavalli neri in posizione. a questo punto, pensavo di riuscire a difendere il re e la mia posizione con h6 e presa di donna sulla presa hxg5. poi, spostato il re in h8, avvicinare , addirittura, raddoppiare le torri sulla colonna f e mi sembrava di stare bene.  invece, ecco una mossa inutile, con perdita di due tempi per due mosse consecutive di alfiere, con il solo scopo di attaccare la donna avversaria senza, peraltro, impensierirla minimamente.  torna a casa, lessie! non faccio a tempo a spostare l'alfiere che il bianco me l'attacca. anche qui ho scelto la soluzione strategicamente meno valida: con il cambio cavallo per alfiere, infatti, il pf6 abbandona la zona delle operazioni della difesa e il re nero è sempre più nudo.  questo velleitario tentativo di creare un diversivo sull'ala di donna è ridicolo: era molto meglio preoccuparsi della posizione esposta del re ora la posizione diventa veramente delicata: il nero minaccia di sfondare con una serie di cambi di pezzi e pedoni e di aprirsi la strada davanti al re nero questo è un segno della confusione mentale in cui mi trovavo ( e non c'entra il raffreddore! ); ritirare l'alfiere in d7, spingere il pf7 in f6, raddoppiare le torri e portare la donna in difes, per esempio in g7 sarebbe stata una scelta strategica logica. così si difende il cavallo, è vero, ma il re adesso non ha solo freddo ... sta congelando!!  torna la spada di damocle sul pedone c7 et voila! e adesso avanti con l'attacco al re nero alla buon'ora: la donna nera si è degnata di portarsi in difesa del proprio re e la colonna h è aperta qui, forse, si poteva approfittare della temporanea impossibilità di accedere alla casa h8 per alzare la torre f8 e dare una via di fuga al re ovviamente, non è possibile catturare latorre d1 con il cavallo perché segue un attacco fortissimo con torre e donna a partire dallo scacco di torre in g4 e a seguire l'entrata della donna bianca sulla colonna h perché attaccare il cavallo in b5 ( e svegliare i can .. pardon, il cavallo che dorme? ) quando è ancora attiva l minaccia su c7 e, soprattutto è imminente un attacco in massa contro li re?  ancora si poteva tentare una fuga con il re: tf7, rf8, re7 e taf8 con questa mossa il nero fa harakiri: il raddoppio delle torri bianche sulla colonna h è devastante evita almeno tg4+, ma ormai è la fine.  il re nero tenta la fuga! ah, no! come non detto! forse, però, col senno di poi, si poteva tentare di scappare in e7, anche se il seguito era comunque difficile.  anche questa è una mossa poco chiara: l'analisi del computer la definisce un errore, suggerendo: … dd5 34. g4 tae8 35. g5 dxg5 36. cf3 dg6 37. txa4 te7 38. dc3 e5 39. cd2  forse si poteva tentare e5 per bloccare l'avanzata del pedone "e" nero; l'analisi del computer dà addirittura rd8 come mossa migliore: … ttd8 36. e5 dxe5 37. cxe5 b5 38. cd3 de7 39. tf5 td5 40. txd5 cxd5 41. de5+ df6 42. tg4+ rh7 43. dh5+ dh6 a vederla così sembra buona: in realtà l'analisi del computer la definisce un errore: secondo lui era meglio dh1. in effetti il raddoppio sulla colonna h non porta niente di buono al nero, anzi... e la frittata è fatta! ora con donna inchiodata sul re non ci sono più speranze.  uno scacco dettato dalla disperazione: l'analisi del computer lo bolla come errore, suggerendo: th8 42. txg3+ cxg3 43. dg4+ rf6 44. te1 thg8 45. th4+ rf5 46. cf7 td1+ 47. txd1 tg6 48. ch6+ txh6 49. dxh6 e5 50. df8+ rg4 51. dg7+ rf4 qui mi sono detto: "vuoi veder che sono riuscito a raddrizzare un po' la situazione?" ma l'attacco di donna e torre che segue mi ha smentito clamorosamente.  non resta che abbandonare: il nero non riesce a difendere contemporaneamente il pc7 e ikl matto di donna in a8.

 this game belongs to the knights of honour pawn structures thread.  this is about a little passed pawn on the a column which was left to create some mayhem similar to the berzerker pawn which is what i will raise in the thread later on.  here is a game against the dentist who has returned from vietnam after another long sabbatical.  he does put me under a bit of pressure in the middlegame but he makes the mistake of leaving his dark square bishop in a pin and then i take full advantage of this.  after a double king pawn opening he plays 2. qf3 which is the napoleon opening.  the last time he played that opening against me i lost - see the dentist has his day http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-dentist-has-his-day?gm=17287.  just hope i don't get bogged down yet again. 3. c3 - gameknot described this move as an inaccuracy: +1.14 » 3. c3 nf6 4. bc4 bc5 5. ne2 na5 6. bb5 c6 7. bd3 d5 8. o-o o-o 9. exd5 nxd5

[%clk 0:15:08]  [%clk 0:15:18]  [%clk 0:15:14]  [%clk 0:15:23]  [%clk 0:15:14] there you go from here on i am 90% sure my opponent will go for d5 to avoid queen exchange. [%clk 0:15:18]  [%clk 0:15:19] protecting c4 and prompting nc3 to attack b4 [%clk 0:14:40] oh no oh no. unfortunately that is unepected move. i am out of my book. my home cooked line is 5.nc3 nf6 6.nxb4 nxe4 7. bxc4 nxf2! 8.kxf2 qh4+ 9.g3 qxc4 and white is set for a bad game but now i am on my own. time is already ticking.  [%clk 0:13:52] just continuing the old trick hoping it would bring same result. [%clk 0:14:02] things already feeling different game than i used to in this line [%clk 0:13:47]  [%clk 0:13:54]  [%clk 0:13:14] i hate pins [%clk 0:13:59]  [%clk 0:13:16]  [%clk 0:13:52] i am dropping pawns and where is my compensation. [%clk 0:12:56] anybody needs mate in one? [%clk 0:13:10] no [%clk 0:12:27] i hated this move  1. the threat can easily be defended and 2. the queen is in a cramped place [%clk 0:12:01]  [%clk 0:09:52] i love this move though and engine agrees to now na4 can be met by qa5+ so i will not lose to nxb  but not for long after white o-o queen got to go.  [%clk 0:11:42] pawns are falling .i am a pawn down [%clk 0:09:52]  [%clk 0:11:37]  [%clk 0:08:39] time for queen to go but is that the best square?  i dont know . i thought qg6 was better more free space. [%clk 0:10:02] now i feel my a7 pawn is in danger after rfa1 doubling  [%clk 0:07:43] unnecessary move i feel bb7  better address my fear [%clk 0:09:05]  [%clk 0:07:09]  [%clk 0:08:00] what did i say? [%clk 0:05:13] just to free my cramped position [%clk 0:076:56] i thought nb6 was more forceful [%clk 0:04:58] no qxc5 for ne5 drops a pawn [%clk 0:07:21]  [%clk 0:04:48] mistake number 1  i dropped e5 pawn for simple overlooking 19. qe5  [%clk 0:06:25] 2 pawns down question is can i save the game? [%clk 0:04:42] simple  trick  [%clk 0:06:16] solves the trick  [%clk 0:04:37]  [%clk 0:06:02]  [%clk 0:03:39] that bishop was there for defending the rook  now it is no longer needed to defend so i try to realigne it to more useful lines [%clk 0:03:56] the doubled rooks are threatening nothing as a7 is well guarded by the bishop which should have been taken by the knight  on move 17 [%clk 0:02:49]  [%clk 0:03:23]  [%clk 0:01:49] under time pressure, and also i could not c any concrete play for a draw [%clk 0:03:28] i thought the queen exchange speed up my draw options and so does agree the engine [%clk 0:01:57] i smell draw signs even if i am 2 pawns down 1. many things are blocked  2. opposite bishops 3. whits isolated double pawn   [%clk 0:03:00] i think e5 was better  [%clk 0:01:56] blocking e5 [%clk 0:02:52] ng6 looks bad for me [%clk 0:00:55]  [%clk 0:02:53] ng6 would have trapped the knight [%clk 0:00:47] now i am beginning to get belief about the draw  [%clk 0:03:03]  [%clk 0:00:39]  [%clk 0:03:13]  [%clk 0:00:48]  [%clk 0:03:11]  [%clk 0:00:38] to stop g4 [%clk 0:03:03]  [%clk 0:00:43]  [%clk 0:03:12] beware g4 cant be defended right away by g-pawn [%clk 0:00:47]  [%clk 0:02:52]  [%clk 0:00:41]  [%clk 0:03:00]  [%clk 0:00:39] blocking any counter playof  r on e7 [%clk 0:02:58]  [%clk 0:00:30]  [%clk 0:02:37]  [%clk 0:00:31] one more pawn restores material equality and rewards my tenacious play  [%clk 0:02:40]  [%clk 0:00:33] now i am eve dreaming better than draw for me [%clk 0:02:12]  [%clk 0:00:26]  [%clk 0:01:53]  [%clk 0:00:18]  [%clk 0:02:02]  [%clk 0:00:24] to win here is difficult but i believe i have guaranteed the draw [%clk 0:01:40]  [%clk 0:00:30]  [%clk 0:01:48]  [%clk 0:00:21] mistake number 2 well not what is this move?  another unforced error drops a pawn but still i think is solid draw [%clk 0:01:56]  [%clk 0:00:25] they say passed pawn is dangerous than exchanging it but i am already in time trouble i should have elected t simple game by fxg4  [%clk 0:01:50]  [%clk 0:00:33]  [%clk 0:01:56]  [%clk 0:00:30] just look whit king can not cross into my territory  i still feel i am controlling the game in a draw position [%clk 0:02:04] it will take a lot of walking if u want to get to my pawns white king so i focus on promoting  my c-pawn as whit bishop can be chased away by my king [%clk 0:00:28]  [%clk 0:01:58] he did not budge as well the race to queen is officially on [%clk 0:00:36] mistake number 4 passed pawns holiday   [%clk 0:02:06] i overlooked the strength of this move i was thinking i will stop it by my bishop  [%clk 0:00:33] i c that the g-pawn is the runaway queen as my bishop can not stop it so i decided to c if i have any chance left over [%clk 0:02:15] true horror watching this pawn fly to the queening square without any opposition [%clk 0:00:31] giving way for my late f-pawn [%clk 0:02:23] one square to go but mine is 3 q´´square to go i feel cold.  [%clk 0:00:40]  [%clk 0:02:31] already a queen. how can i guard my pawn to queen with just a king and bishop [%clk 0:00:49] the reason why i decided to annotate this game i feel glimmer of hope fantastically according to the engine this position is a dead draw. white queen can not simply prevent the queening of my pawn  but i had to be sharp precise  [%clk 0:01:38]  [%clk 0:00:51] game over last chance and only move to save game was bd2. it was hard for me to understand why even after the game  but close inspection i see that it got to do with the resulting position in the king pawns end game his king on d2 and my king on f1 is draw but his king on e3 and my king on f1 is lost [%clk 0:01:30]  [%clk 0:00:53] even 53....f1q 54. qxq kxf1 kxe3 would lose for reason i stated earlier. [%clk 0:01:26] i lost but it was a beautiful and lively game. i believe the errors in the game add beauty to the game. i would love to hear your comments. 
-------------------------------------
here are some analysis from two games in a recent gruenfeld mini-tournament (the other game was against "yulio"), where we follow a main line with the big question: how strong will whites advanced d-pawn be? the answer seems to be: very strong - but take a look at both games. nothing much in this. it has been played thousands of times, but here white may consider a line with bc4. karpov preferred it in quite a few games against kasparov - though with little success. the classical attack of the white center. the second attack on the center, but white has a good counter. where should be5 go to? over the years there has been a dispute of wether bg7 or bc7 is best. i find bg7 a bit too passive, but at least it protects the king. i tried the latter instead. so finally, here is the d-pawn only three moves from the queening square. nothing critical yet, but in this position i would prefer the white pieces: better development, control over the half open b-file, and the pawn ... ? a waste of time. according to later computer analysis, this was my only inaccuracy, but from now on black is positionally more or less out of the game. 16. - b6 was better, but still ba5 looks like a problem child. white has put his pieces on perfect squares, so my only hope was some kind of a swindle on the k-side. hadn´t it been for the pawn on d6, i would still have some optimism, but my opponent finds all the right moves. what a pawn! almost game over, but what if my bishop had been on g7 instead of getting astray on c7 and a5? looks like suicide, but i could not find anything better. my queen is in the firing line from rf1 and soon also from bb2. black just got blown off the board, mostly because of bad piece coordination and that insisting pawn on d7. i will loose a lot of material (starting on f6), so in respect of my good opponent i chose to resign. at least i learned something - just take a look at my other game from the same tournament! 
-------------------------------------
all standard icelandic stuff. in the previous game, my moves (c6, bc5, etc.) have failed, so i went for the strong line:  you're right: black will have a hard time freeing his dsb and defending from the aligning of the r on e1. i bet i can manage it in a blitz.  good.  ? this is a little tricky: the wlsb is pinned, so i can do this. but this is pointless, as you'll see. bg4 is no better after o-o. it is a mistake due to the easy d3 answer by white, that makes me lose tempos in developement. my opponent didn't play it, and it was not a bad choice.  of course. now white threats bxb and re1. i can retreat my b to e6, but this will be a two tempoes loss. no way. i have just few possible lines here. the point is that white didn't weakened himself with central pawn's moves, and this is the best for him in this situation.  if qxb, qxq and everything is quiet.  from the beginning, my plan is to castle queenside and use the d column.  none of my n can defend me from re1, but this is the tempo i need to unpin the q.  ng5 would be good, but qxnf4 is threatened.  ? much better was d3, defending the n while developing. this move makes an unusual white's formation, joined with the extreme lack of a pawn's structure... leads to unexplored boundaries. where to move the q? i want to free my dsb, so out of his diagonal (f8-a3). i want to use white's weakness of f2: true is that it is defended twice now, but in the near future nd3 must move, and if one of my n can reach e4 or g4... b6 seems a good place for this.  it blocks the natural square for the black n on d7. but i am not forced to play it there. on this spot - note - my q can't be one-move harassed by the white knights. now: which point is weak in my field, and why and how can white exploit it? oh, not at all. the idea to possess the diagonal and develop the b via b2 is good. but makes this the nd3 safe and sure? not at all... ok, the point is that forces white to react: black can play nxn now, and rxe3, winning a pawn. if white uses the tempo to play 13. bg2, black can consider the previous line, winning a pawn, or rxne3 (threats qxf2+,so is practically forced) 14. cxe3, nxe3, threatening to win back the exchange or nxbg2. the only reasonable way for white to get out of this is 15. bxnf6, nxre1, 16. qxne1, gxbf6. black has scrambled pawns but a nice semi-open g column to play with, and the dsb. not bad. i'll check this with the board later. on the other side, white's nxn allows bxc5, threatening f2, stopping d4, and solving my dev problem. not bad! an alternate solution, that incidentally presses on my own weak spot, f7, with a fork. that will win an exchange. but my pressure on f2 is stronger. i must go on.  if nxn, nxn and the threat remains the same. white can defend with qe2, and must do it or... find black's next move if white plays (say) h3. well, white escaped nc3! by black. being d2 pinned, white would have lost his q for n and r. now, i sill can't take the pawn, but i can play nc3, q moves, bb4, defending it. but then a3... no, i have to create complications... and free my last pieces. i already accepted nxf7, and the exchange loss, so i have to make the most of my playing forces.  it is not good: bd2 helps white's developement. but if bd2, nc3. and the q is trapped, forcing to bxn, bxbc3, which forks both white's rooks. this "returns" the fork white will play, nxf7... and the crossed exchanges will go on. crazy. of course: if be2, black can also think in rxd4!?, with the following idea: nxr, qxn (qxf2 is threatened). but white has be3. so, i think that black will lose this, if white plays properly. but white didn'! white goes for the exchanges. now, this is a nice tactic melée, as often. i don't use engines, so to work out the best move would take me too long. nc3, qd2, nd5, q moves gives me an exchange, but white has his own in return. this move forces white to retake the b and not one of the rooks, because of bxf2+. black can play (and should) have played be3, stopping once for all all black's threats and his fork is still active.  ?? the bad rook. my other r is the dangerous one! ...winning d4. but with lots of tactics involved, as you'll see.  note that qb5+, qd3, doesn't give anything to black. nc3 now is meaningless. so this was the natural move. it threatens ra1 with a discovered attack on the wq, that makes useless most defences (but rb1). but white has a brilliant move to answer. can you see it? now, my dsb is pinned, and it can't give check, nor i can force the wk to a square for it to check. of course i can defend, but... (can you believe it? material balance is = 0!). as "brilliant" is the threat, it has a "brilliant" solution (if i am not wrong). can you see it?  simple, but effective. r is defended, my b unpinned, ra1 threatened, and nf7 too.  good and forced idea. a pity for my wonderful dsb.  not qxd4, qxq, rxq, ne4. i still can get something more from the position. always remember this. you can get wrong, but that's how you explore chess. now, after the r is removed, qf2# is threatened. white's best defence is probably bd2. white went for... ...covering f2 from a possible mate, and threatening qf5+. but... (can you see it)? ! qb5+ is pointless after f4. incidentally, another very good move was rd2. white can't take bxr or nxb+ forks white's q. white's check on qf5+ just causes kb8 and nothing changes. here, my opponent blundered qxr, and i mated him with qf2#. what if... ...and white is lost. i'll check it... thank you for reading. hope you had some fun at least.

hi everyone!  despite the fact that pawn forks are more easier to spot than knight forks, even in games at class a/expert level pawn forks can occur!  in this case there was a pin motif accompanying the fork.  but who was the victim?  well read on! 2. …. e6 - after allowing white to build an impressive pawn centre i now prepare to attack it - e6 prepares d5! 3. ….. nc6 - development first! 4. a3 - preventing a possible nb4. 5. …… e5 was played instead of d5 - white now has a very impressive looking pawn wall on the queenside.  a few jstevens1 hedgehog like moves follow. 7. ….. ng6 sir lollabout must give fou lenoir some air! 9. …… bd7 - and we have another jstevens1 position - oh dear! 11. …… c6 - challenging white's queenside bind. 12. ….. qc8 - suddenly glenda eyes up the kingside should king butz choose to go there! 14. …. bd8 - to challenge b6. 17. exd5? - yup, with the e4 square doubly defended you wouldn't think a pawn fork was possible would you? 17. ……. e4! - i play it all the same because if the wq goes to the e file she will be pinned against king butz by my king rook. 18. nd2 - he saves his knight. 20. kd1 - so my opponent loses two material points and the right to castle.  getting this far is one thing but how to proceed from there is another.  with my next move i use fou leblanc to ramp up the pressure. 21. nb3 - white is forced to put his knight in a pin - his king has no safe moves and it is the lowest value piece he can put in the way.  now comes a knight fork. 22. ……. qf5 - out comes glenda! 24. …. re2+ - the queens are off the board but king butz is in deep do-dos! 25. ….. ne4+ - white is a long, long way from copping old matey but will also be a long, long way behind in material as he cannot save his c3 knight.  he will be 5 points down on material.  despite the rating differentials he decided this was far too much and waved the white flag.  thanks to this game i got my second expert victory and enjoyed a brief sojourn in the 1900s.

hi everyone!  somehow, i, jo stevens yet again managed to get struck down by passivitis in the middlegame.  did this result in me having to wave the white flag with henry faced with certain armageddon from the newly crowned white queen or will a reappearance of glenda bring about the final twist in the endgame?  you will have to read on and see!  kind regards - joanne 2. bc4 - bishop's opening. 2. ……. nf6 - hitting at e4. 3. qf3 - transposing into a napoleon opening.  here  i have to watch out for scholar's mate, particularly if white plays g4 on the next turn. 3. …….. bc5 - development. 6. ….. a5 - looking to trap the bishop on b3. 8. …..0-0 time to castle kingside.  i must be very wary of white's light square  bishop bearing down on f7. 10. …… ne7 - glad to see the back of that  bishop! 12. …… d6 - so white sacs a pawn eh?  what is he up to? 15. bd2 - white concentrates on development rather than breaking up my pawns by dxc6 ep. 18. qxf4 - so i have the  bishop pair against two knights.  unfortunately, fou lenoir is a bit out of the game on a7 and he will stay there for many moves to come. 19. ….. qd7 - clearing the decks. 21. ….. rxe8 - rook trade. 25. ndf3 - out of nowhere white launches a kingside mating attack! 27. qh5! threatening qg6 - nasty, nasty! 27. ….. hxg5 - on careful analysis i must accept the sacrifice immediately.  one of the considerations is the possibility of either my rook or glenda delivering mate on white's back row. 28. ….. bd7 - this move looked good at the time but in fact ga gave it ??  it certainly looked as though i would be faced with qf7+ on the next turn with the words "draw offer - perpetual check" but white had other ideas. 30 …… ke7 - run henry, run! 34. ….. qxc4 - suddenly there is only one lonely white pawn on the queenside.  on the kingside, however, there is a different story.  there is 4 potentially lethal white pawns!  eeek and double eeek! 36. qxf5 - threatening e7+. 39. f4 - despite the queen trade i will still have to watch those kingside pawns.  however, i now have an extra piece in fou lenoir.  at the moment he is still out of play but never fear, i have now found a use for him.  over the next few moves you will see just what use i will be putting him to. 40. ……. bd8 - now you will see that operation joblock is about to strike again.  those white pawns will be blockaded by fou lenoir.  normally i use operation joblock to grind out a draw against the experts but here i will use it to try and promote my own black pawns without interference from the other side. 41. ….. d3 - pawn push! 45. …. dxc4 - pawn trade.  now i have 4 passers on the queenside - wow! 48 …… c2! white will have to give up his rook to stop glenda from making a re-appearance. 50. rd7 - so, he keeps his rook on but, there is glenda and she will now show you just what she can do on an open board! 50. ….. qc2+ - queen fork no.1. 51. ….. qxf5 - the clean up begins! 52. …… qxe6+ queen fork no.2 - with his rook about to go on the next turn white waves the white flag.  so, i win the game but by god isn't jo a lucky so and so - would you all agree?

this is a veresov wich is going to have some nice pawn formation. just preventing a close knight pawn close up, nice diagonal formation, symetric but whit a bishop thretning c2 went for a change to open kings column another close up by pawns, nice picture. note that a prision has been formed leaving the white knight trapped, it´s doomed. i think this is not too good for white pressure on the prisioner two knights front attack, but note that there is +1 for the black, 11. nc4xn d4xc5 12 bc4x..  cautelous defence for breaking formation i think i should won the pawn first, but well, pressure to the k see what happen this is a good formation, going for a fresh start, like new attack, or contraoffensive, black winning place new pawn structure. stairways formed giving a diagonal strong attack, i don´t know why but two diagonals cover usually falls into mistakes, they are hard to see (in this level of play of course). i mean diagonals by bc1 and qc2. see what i mean, but even g4 was doomed whit knight retreat, ohh humans!! didn´t want to retraet and fell in, no one can blame, knight to the back and  restores the original chess position, is awful so mind play tricks on us. white searching room for a queen-rook counter attack maybe, if holes are open completing the attack, queen bishop went downstairs, formation by pawn holding the white offensive most completed white into the waters of black evil inoffensive check and awful move check and the rest is clear. 21 ..qe2 22 qc3 and rook dies attack worked and queen dead is going for mate and a good looking mate! so veresov, without a plan by white, retreating can be devastating. but i found really interesting the pawn structures i repeat:  5. diagonal bicoulur formation, symetric (with a white bishop pushing just a little more) 7. semicircle prision to white knight 14. refreshing the attack, linear formation 15. stairway formation 17. stairway holding, queen and bishop double attack.  thanks!!

presque une première pour moi, la dernière fois que j'ai joué g6 en match officiel j'ai lamentablement perdu...  peu etre devrais-je jouer c5 ? j'avais un plan different  flute il ne prend pas  voila exactement le genre de plan blanc qui m'enquiquine fortement !  pourquoi ? bonne question... je crois que voulais donner du jeu a ma tour f  le but est encore de jouer, je veux ouvrire taper sur c2  pourquoi je prend pas en d5 ?  il s'est fait avoir !  je me suis fais avoir ! d6 est perdu et tout tombe, e5 et c5 se retrouverons seul et je suis chagriné de ne pas avoir plus reflechit avant de prendre f2, c'est mechant les cavaliers il ne faut pas l'oublier !  jesus... dxd6 et j'etais foutu... coool !  malagres mon avantage materiel, je le sens pas bien et j'ai peur a tout moment de me prendre une vilaine fourchette, alors je propose nul deux coups plus tard et il accepte. mais je pense que td4 etait pas mal ! mais il faut bien tout calculer... fritz ma dit que td4 etait bon.   
-------------------------------------
j'ai peur si je joue 3.d4 qu'il connaisse trop bien ça sicilienne...  je m'attendais pas a g6, que je trouve mauvais ! e6 et g6 ca fait trop  j'ai longtemps hesité à pousser d4, mais c'est le champ de la dame noire qui m'a fait jouer d3 (qu'elle arrive en f6 ou b6 avec un fou en c5 etc...)  je reserve 0-0-0 et attaque sur l'aile roi,  la il joue 9...bxd4, j'avais plutôt regarder cxd4 nb5 e5 bh6 0-0 car je me suis dit qu'apres 9...bxd4 il arrivait mon bh6 ce qui gene noir  sur e5 je pensais a nxd4 exf4 nf3 gagne le pion  trop passif, mais j'ai peur de d5  laisser la tour sur la diagonale pourrais devenir dangereux un jour ou l'autre  j'ai analysé qh4 h3 il a rien, ou bxh2+ kxh2 qh4+ kg1 il a rien non plus et je menace dans les deux cas bg5 qui enferme la dame  la il faut savoir qu'ilk me reste 15 minutes (la cadence est a 1h30+30s/coup) il lui 1h10  compliqué et je me demande bien ce qui la machine !  j'ai hasité a jouer bg5 a la place de fxe5, mais bxg5 fxg5 et plus rien tape sur e5 et son roi  le temps me force a jouer vite, je me suis dit que sur qd4+ be3, je regarde pas plus loin  la aussi c'est pas facile, j'hesite beaucoup entre nf2 et ng3, je me dis qu'au moins avec ng3 si qd4 arrive je ne suis pas coulé  c'était un peu chaud mais je m'en sort quand meme et pense pouvoir choper la nulle  combien de fois j'ai entendu dire fou de couleur opposé = nulle, punaise ça me faisais stresser !!!  j'ai joué ke2 rapidement et ai vu bxc4 trop tard, encore un coup de stresse !  il voit rien ouf....  maaaaaauvais !!! qu'elle nouille je pense que c'est la que je perde, le roi arrive et va prendre g4  j'ai eu tres peur de bd1, mais je sens de toute facon que ma position va s'ecrouler d'un moment a un autre  abandon. reelement mort ici, bf1 bd1! bxg4 kxg4 et ces pions avancent tranquille ! je m'en veut sur ce 38.g4 :(  
-------------------------------------
so here i was up against the highest rated player in the tournament so i reply with my usual he follows the main line and so do i he continues with the open sicilian so i take he takes back i hit the e pawn he defends i stop ideas such as nd4xnc6 followed by e5. all this is very standard and this is the most popular too, the richter–rauzer attack. the move 6.bg5 was kurt richter's invention, threatening to double black's pawns after bxf6 and forestalling the dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable, as g6 is simply met by bxnf6 and after exf6 black's pawns are a mess, the d6 pawn in particular being isolated and backward on a semi-open file and the d5 square is open for white's pieces. i follow a suggestion by barden he continues to develop i start queen side operations. qb6 is probably stronger, taking advantage of the fact this his bg5 can't defend dark squares in the centre. he prepares to castle i continue to expand on the queen side he castles so i hit his knight. now he can play 10. bg5xnf6 as after bxnc3, hitting the white queen, white can play 11. qd2xc3 and after gxbf6 play 12. nd4xnc6, winning a pawn. however black can reply with qc7 and after white retreats his knight, exchange queens on c3 and the position is about level. black has compensation for being a pawn down, as white's queen side pawns are smashed. this was better for white compared to what happened, where white ends up a pawn down and a broken pawn formation. so he keeps his knight but loses a pawn, and his queen and bishop are forked so he moves his queen i take his bishop he takes back i secure my b pawn, releasing the nc6 from protecting it, and preparing the following move he develops i hit his bishop, and prevent any nonsense down the e file. so he retreats his bishop and i prepare to put my bishop on g7, protecting ne5 and also with an idea of an attack along the long dark diagonal. so he tries to exchange my strong knight and i strengthen it he now takes the opportunity to get rid of one of my bishops so i hit the knight he takes i take back he tries to do something on the king side i castle this was a bit of a surprise. h5 seemed more consistent so my queen mobilises. can you see what i am dreaming of? is the king any safer here? i continue to mobilise and he protects c2 ihit his queen, sacrificing my e7 pawn. i thought he couldn't take it, and was expecting another queen move, however..... ok, pause and find my next move! i thought i was clearly winning. the threat is qxb2 mate. if he takes my queen, i take back with the pawn, discovered check and mate in 2. i couldn't see any defence for white. so pause again, and work out what white did play. this must be his best shot. if i take with the bishop then he takes my bishop with his queen, and after i take take back he can take my queen and this time there is no mate. but what if i take with my knight? so i tried this he takes i take king runs this is ok, but lets white escape into an ending. nd7 was probably better so he blocks the check i take he takes i take the 7th rank bishop mobilises knight advances, threatening r(either!)xc2 he prevents that, but runs into.... picking up the exchange. white resigns. many thanks for looking at this, please rate my annotation on the star system and leave some comments, so i know how i am doing. please remember that this was a quick-play game, both sides had just 15 minutes each to make all moves. until next time! 
-------------------------------------
so i start with my usual still very normal so into the benoni-benko systems. white has a slight space advantage. but will play his bf8 to g7 and try to build up pressure along the long black diagonal, combined with play on the queen's side. white may try for a large break through in the centre and/or a king side attack. it is quite unbalanced, which is why it is popular. according to the stats, 2.....c5 leads to less draws and more wins for both white and black. so dave goes for what the english-speaking world call the benko gambit, after pal benko, a hungarian-american grandmaster who provided many of the ideas. in other countries it is known as the volga gambit. black gives up a pawn on the queen side. the idea is to get open a and b files, which combined with the bg7 can give overwhelming pressure on the queen side. the advanatages of this system is that black's initiative and pressure can last well into the endgames and can continue even if a number of pieces have been exchanged. it is also a relatively easy system to play for black. i prefer this to just falling in with black's idea by taking the second pawn. there are some interesting lines here, such as 5. nc3 axb5 6. e4 b4 7. nb5 nxe4 8. qe2 (if black moves the knight white has nd6 mate!) f5 9. f3 ra5 10. fxe4 ba6 11. exf5 bxb5 12. qh5+ g6 13. fxg6 bg7 14. gxh7+ kf8 with advantage to white. zontakh, andrey (2545) vs. milanovic, dani… (2420) and sauleda roig, j… (2152) vs. fiol company, j… (2189). white won both games. so i grab the centre, and give further protection to my pawn on b5. hoping at some stage to be able to get in e5 and cause disruption to the black set-up. i find bb7 a bit odd. bg7 looks so natural, and indeed, is the only move on the gameknot world database. nf3 is played to support an eventual e5. computer prefers bxa6 or bc4 here. i did conside bc4. i was a bit afraid of the bishop being hit by nb8-d7-b6. computer agrees with these moves and already thinks white has the upper hand. i was quite confident too, but mindful of my previous 2 games, i was being careful not to get over-confident. computer agrees these are the best moves for both sides. computer prefers na6 for him and a4 for me. what we both missed was that black can in fact play nxe4 here. if white takes the knight with the queen, black can exchange on c3 and then pick up the bishop on b5, and if white recaptures the knight on e4 with his knight then black plays c4 which puts white in check and then he can play queen takes bishop next move. instead he tries to open the centre, but he misses a tactic. this is it! the black e pawn is hard to defend. 14...d5 of course defends the e pawn with his queen, but this moves allows me to cut his bg7 out of the game, gains a space advantage, and it is still hard for him to prevent losing a pawn. computer actually likes 15. exd5. what do you think dear reader? rather than go into defensive mode, dave decides to give up a pawn. this time i did see that if i took the pawn immediately, c4 would lose a bishop computer actually prefers rd1, but both moves seem good to me. computer prefers nc6 to nd7 and still likes rd1. certainly the knight on d7 doesn't seem to have many prospects and comes under fire down the d file. i wanted to make sure that there were no sacrifices on e5 - he may well have been loking at giving up a piece for 2 pawns on e5 to free his position. now if he takes back with the pawn, which is probably best, i was going to play qg4 hitting the knight on d7 and also with ideas of playing qe6 check followed by nf7 check, picking up the exchange. computer actually prefers to follow up with 21. rd1 and thinks white has a decisive advantage, because after 21. qg4 black has qd4 check and if kh1 black can then take the pawn on e5 with either knight or queen, as there is a pin on the f4 pawn, and if white captures on e5 there is rf8xrf1 mate! or if instead rf2 black has nxe5 and there is still a pin on the f4 pawn. however black decides to throw in the queen check immediately. he is getting his bishop back, but helping my development. computer agrees with these moves and says white has a decisive advantage. i was originally going to play qg4 with similar threats, but i thought that this move kept more central control. i was wrong, qg4 would have been better, as now he finds a way of staying in the game. with the queen on g4 i would have been able to play qxg6, but white is winning easily. for the record, computer prefers 24. b4. what do you think dear reader? mobilising my reserves....computer actually prefers qe7 dave takes advantage of a pin on my knight, so if 26. nxr?? qxq. once again i have the chance to win two rooks for the queen with 26. qxr, rxq 27. nxr, but i decided this was better. computer actually prefers e6 and afterwards i was thinking that b4 may have been better. i think they all win! after the game dave confessed he just didn't see this move. computer prefers the queen capture. rf45 threatened my rook of course. a nice move to play! regaining the rook. white is winning easily. computer wants to resign this position. computer prefers e6 and is probably right. black is making one last bid.... threatening mate! black has just a few spite checks. black could resign here. and black finally resigns. thanks for reading my annotation. don't forget to leave comments and to rate my annotation, to let me know how i am doing! until next time..... 
-------------------------------------
this was a rather painful loss from a couple of years ago. our knock-out team were away to pen-y-ffordd. on paper they seemed a perfect match for us, with 2 stronger players and then a big gap and 4 weaker players. unfortunately when we turned up, i found that they had a couple of "ringers" - pat bennett being one of them - who hadn't played for pen-y-ffordd before or since. at the time pat out-graded me, but most of my other players were out-graded by an even higher amount, so although i was black, and faced what was on paper a stronger opponent, i wanted to win! so it starts conventionally enough. perfectably playable, although 2. c4 is more common. i normally play the grünfeld defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence against d4. i was wondering if this was going to transpose into a grünfeld defence i continue to develop. he decides to fianchetto his king's bishop too. i castle. he completes his fianchetto. i play this, mainly because it is played in the grünfeld defence. i play in the same 4ncl league team as my opponent, and i asked him months later whether or not he had specially prepared this opening against me. he replied that he had prepared it, not against me specifically, but generally against grünfeld defence players. so he takes. i take back.  he castles. i develop. he advances in the centre. i retreat. he advances again. i found out later that na5 is more commonly played and scores better. at the time, to me, it seemed to make sense to try and exchange a few pieces as white has the stronger centre. so he takes. i take back. and he develops again. i chip at his centre.  he develops his bishop with tempo, attacking my rook. the rook only had one square. this move scores two out of two in the database of world chess games! so i take. he takes back. i develop my bishop. now this position has been seen twice on the opening databases of gameknot. on the database of games played on gameknot there is pitagoran (2031) vs. wildrussianbear (1806) and on the database of world games there is heck, norbert (2271) vs. mueller, frank (2004). white won both of them. pitagoran (2031) vs. wildrussianbear (1806) continued with 15. rac1 instead, while heck, norbert (2271) vs. mueller, frank (2004) continued with 15. rad1 the queens adds power to the be4 and also protects nb6 along the rank. he mobilizes his rook. and so do i. he attacks a7. so i defend, and hit the knight. the knight takes up a more central role. and my bishop drops back, freeing my nb6. he hits the other bishop. which drops back. and he continues his king side advances, threatening f5xg6 and discovering an attack on my queen. i can answer that with qxg6 but then it means my king side pawns are isolated and weaker. my computer likes simply capturing on f5 now with the pawn, but i felt this left my king side pawns rather weak and isolated. 20...bxf5 is playable too. 21. g4 doesn't win a piece as black has 21....qe7 braking the pin and attacking be3. white can get the pawn back immediately with	bxf5 21. nxf5 gxf5 22.	bxb6	cxb6 23. qxb6. perhaps this is chickening out, but it does keep the king side closed. and now his knight, which started out as his queen side knight, now takes up the position usually taken by this king side knight! computer says this is the best move for white in this position. the pawn was attacked, so it advances again. computer likes this move too. he attacks my queen with tempo. this seems the best square for the queen. his attacked knight advances. and i reposition my knight to a more central location. computer likes this move. he advances again. i am trying to exchange bishops, and hopefully win the pawn on f6. computer prefers ne5. he avoids the exchange and attacks my queen. my queen drops back. and he re-enforces the pawn on f6. i decide to attack his bishop. he now comes up with a combination that i hadn't seen. computer prefers 26...qc5+ of course! if i take the knight, 28. f7+ is very strong.  27....ac5+ can be met with be3, but that may have been marginally better than what i played. so he throws in a check. it may be best just to give up the exchange here, but white is winning easily no matter what. cartainly black has to avoid 28..... kf8?? 29. bxh6 mate. 28....kh7 qd3+ looks pretty grim for black too. this is another strong move by white, attacking my queen. i should have taken the queens off with qb6+ here. black is still losing, but black is crushed in the game. so i throw in this check instead.  bishop comes back with tempo. 30....qb5, trying to exchange queens was probably stronger. finally the pawn goes. i felt safer having my queen near the king for protection, but it is an illusion, in fact the queen takes up a valuable flight square for the king. 31...qc5+ was better. he throws in a check. i see that i am losing my queen, but i decide to at least get two pieces for her. so my king comes up. checkmate to the black queen! 33. qe3 threatening mate was perhaps even stronger, but both moves win for white. i take the bishop. he takes her.  i take the knight. opening up the diagonal for his queen to come in. played to reach the time control. black's position is hopeless. by the time all the other games were over. we had lost the match heavily. rather than put the clocks back 15 minutes each, i decided to resign.  many thanks for reading this! please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
and carry on with my usual. now is he going to play the gruenfeld with 3....d5 or a king's indian with bg7 king's indian it is! and i continue with the saemisch variation. we continue with the usual development. 6....nc6 is a more dymanic way of meeting white's set-up compared with the formations chosen in charles higgie vs. kevin short or charles higgie vs. mike williams (see previous annotations). now i remember at university a player called rod newbury playing this against me. i was desparately thinking back to over 30 years ago! i had memories of playing d5 in this position and losing quickly, although now i see in the opening databases d5 is playable, although what i play here is more popular and has a higer ratings. both a6 and qd2 are the most popular moves in this position - although of course at the time i didn't know that. so i finally accept the challenge and advance. nc1 is the most widely played move in this position, although white seems to have a host of choices here - rb1, rc1, h4 and a3 all scoring well on the database. this was the point, to move my knight to what i thought was a commanding square and so be able to develop my bf1. i didn't want to open the b file for him and give some point to 8...rb8. i saw later on the opening database that 11. dxc6 e.p. bxc6 12. rb1 c5 13. nc2 seems to be a good line for white. i wanted to deter him from playing b5. afterwards i found that f4 had led to a win in raghuram balaji… (2043) vs. venkat, sundara… (2152). a5 had led to a draw in petersen wolfga… (2091) vs. mueller daniel (2260). but that game had continued with 12...ne8, 13. be2 nc7 etc. my opponent finds a more aggressive set up. i have a plan to double his pawns and get rid of my bad bishop on e2, whose movements are blocked by my own pawns. i am now going to compare my moves with the suggested moves of a computer. (this was done after the game obviously). the computer here recommends exf5 instead of f4 the computer again recommend exf5 now i quite liked this position. i thought the exchange had dragged his f pawn away from the centre and so had relived pressure on my centre. i had finally managed to castle, and got rid of my white squared bishop. the computer recommends g3 instead of 0-0 i didn't want to open up my king's side position, i though h3 kept everything under control. the computer thinks qd3 or hxg3 is better. it thinks black is better in this position. what do you think dear reader? i didn't see much point to qc8. he is never going to be able sac soundly on h3. so i decide to move my knight to a better square - d3 from where it will be protecting b2 and perhaps preparing to support e5. computer prefers qe2 or e5 and still thinks black is better. so i decide not to open the b file. computer also thinks this is the right move. computer prefers a5 to this. i decide to move back to d1 where it protects b2. computer prefers ne2 black decides to re-centralise his knight, attacking my e pawn which is hard to defend. in this position i found a sequence of moves which seems to relieve pressure on my position, so may the computer is right to suggest qa6 instead. computer agrees with e5, and still thinks black is better. so if he takes my knight, i take his. computer prefers exd6 first. so if now nxf1, i have a queen check on d5, then i can take his rook, or so i thought. what we both missed, but the computer didn't was that after nxf1, 25. qd5+ e6! 26. qxe6+ rf7! and my knight on d7 is pinned so i can't take his rook on c8. this is why white should exchange pawns on d6 first. now my knight is becoming active, i have managed to keep material equality. i am a bit surprised computer thinks black is slightly better. what do you think dear reader? seems best to drive the bishop back again. computer prefers qd4 i have a plan to force his pawns to e6 and d5 where the pressure on my pawns on f4 and e5 has gone, and so his bishop is restricted and i have a lovely square on d4 for my knight. computer prefers qd3. i'm not convinced this is better. computer prefers qd3 still. it thinks the position is even. he has only driven the knight to a better square. so i play to move to d4. the computer agrees with me and thinks the position is even. i thought with queens off my advantages of a good knight and a passed a pawn would be easier to convert to a win. computer prefers nd4 or kh1, after which white is slightly better. i thought the knight was great on this square, attacking e6 but also able to quickly move to the queen side to support the a pawn advance. computer rates this as even. so passed pawn need to be pushed! computer also likes rf3. i push again and the computer agrees! i push again, and the computer agrees! it thinks the position is even however. this is my big blunder! i thought this was good, attacking e6. i was expecting re8 when nb5 wins for me. unfortunately i had missed something. computer suggests nb5 here, with equality. oops! if rd1 then bxd4 and if rxd4 then rc1 mate. so i resigned. many thanks for viewing my game. please leave a comment and rate my annotation!

hi everyone!  it is not often i give away the outcome of a game in the title, but because this game will go in a themed thread on walking the walk & learning to run, i feel it is necessary.  the player who is at a disadvantage (either threatened with # on the move) or behind on material usually instigates the perpetual check.  but who was the instigator of the perpetual?  read on and find out. 1. ….. c5 - in response to the reti, simon plays c5.  i think he is hoping to transpose into a sicilian. 4. nxd4 - and it does! 7. …… a5 - i think simon is trying to stop me from castling long. 8. be3 - development. 11. 0-0 - so i go kingside. 14. cxd5 - b for p trade. 15. ….. na6 - simon's knight is driven back. 16. nc4 - and sir lollabout goes forward! 17. qxe4 - and now glenda zaps a pawn!  but will she get away with it?  we shall see. 18. qd1 - she bids a hasty retreat! 19. nd2 - so does sir lollabout! 20. rc1 - pin! 24. nc4 - after a plethora of exchanges, sir lollabout returns to c4.  i now have a passer on d6.  this looks good but it looks as though simon has a plan of attack from his heavies via the queenside. 25. rd1 - threatening d6 forking bq and bb. 27. qg4 - glenda is thinking of entrenching herself on d6 with check. 28. ……. qxd6 - knight trade. 31. rc2 - i plan to trade my b pawn for simon's c pawn. 32. kf1? - in retrospect a misstep for henry.  i was loathe to create the possibility of back row chances by putting him on h1.  however, henry will be far more trapped as the game will evolve. 33. qe6+ - so both queens sit on the e file and on their respective opponent's third rank! 36. ….. bb6 - i end up a clear exchange and two pawns up.  but, henry is just starting to shiver.  it seems as though old matey is about to descend on f2 and i can do nothing about it.  but! 38. qxc8 cheeeck!! 39. ….kg6 - this move is virtually forced.  either kf8 or kg8 lead to glenda delivering mate on e8. 40. qg4+ glenda checks king simon again! 40. …. kf7 - king simon retreats to f7.  he could block the check with his queen but i would simply trade queens and he is an exchange plus two pawns down - not in his best interests.  the king retreat allows glenda to check again on d7. 42. qg4+ and draw offer which simon accepts.  he told me in the chat that he felt it was quite an exciting game.  ah well, i hope you have a good read because i have two more annotations in the pipeline for you.  one more from yours truly which i will call berserker pawn and another from ab15 which will require a lot of thought! 
-------------------------------------
a strange game, with a complex edged to edged position (i.e : probably mistakes from both sides) which suddenly basculated. i do not know much about the petrov defense anyway, i like the center game most agressive answer... one tempo against one pawn, gambit situation... ok for me equilibrating the material situation, losing one tempo and aggressively contesting the center. lancelot the brave accepts the challenge of the black knight. ... and falls on the battlefield. arthur is safe now to prepare the castle and take control of the d8h4 diagonal. now that the king is safe, the left wing soldiers can advance. initiating a trade. both sides will get an isolate pawn in the center. perceval enters in the battle, straight toward the center. not sure it's a good move : black central pawn will still be isolated, white's one will be supported by his comrade on c3, the e file will be under white's control. no real choice there were other candidate moves (12. re1, 12. rb1) but it's a fork attack between h7 (mating menace) and the isolated d5 pawn. white has now full control on the center but dame guenièvre can easily be fired. menacing the c3 pawn. menacing the rook and the king, on the long term. black will have difficulties to force the dsb to leave his advanced post. setting the rook in safe, aiming at the center, menacing the queen. protecting the queen and the c pawn. white controls the center, nobody conrols the open file, the black king is unsafe, white is ahead in material black's pieces are well grouped and can initiate a quick counterattack. each side has one unprotected bishop. white has an isolated pawn on the left wing.  white's plan is to attack the back king, using the open e file but for that i need to regroup the troops which are not on the proper squares. it will necessitate some manoeuvres because black has dangerous available possibilities. attacking the queen, the a pawn and protecting f7 dama guenièvre goes for a long trip. she'll move 7 times in the 27 total moves of the game. black's plan seems to contest the center. if he eliminates the c3 pawn, he'll have strong attacking possibilities. taking control of the open file it seems to me a weak move. probably done to prepare 19. ... b5. and may be to prevent 19. bb5, so that black can play a further re8. the queen carries on travelling in her domain. she still protects the a pawn and is now on the open file. her final destination is f3 black attacks on the queen's wing and still aim at the center but it weakens his position on the kingside. rook on the open file, menacing b7 i judged that white's position was now strong enough on the kingside to let black take pawns on the queenside. black's queenside pawns are now safe but the g2a8 diagonal is now wide open for white. the aim of the queen's travel. menacing mate by 22. qxf6 ... 23. qg7+ mate fianchetoing the bishop. forcing the rook to move. to double the rook but the c8 rook is now unprotected and dame guenièvre is looking at a8 to double the rooks and indirectly protect c3 (which i hoped black would bite). ?? mistake, the black queen is doomed and the game is lost for black. if 24. ... qa5 25. rxc8+ and the mate is unavoidable for if 25. ... bf8 26. bh6 black trades a queen against rook taking the queen blunder, the game is lost for black. unavoidable mate in 5 in 4... ... in 3 black submits here. 
-------------------------------------
my opponent has played this a number of times... and i usually develop the bishop instead of playing 3.d4. it's a perfectly good alternative. especially when my rather defensively minded opponent allows me the luxury of what almost amounts to an extra move. the game develops in fairly standard way, with both sides getting pieces into play. somehow, despite the early innacuracy, my opponent doesn't suffer too many consequences. maybe i should have been more aggressive. i could exchange and double black's pawns, something that happens in the scotch opening, but i have a tendency to leave castling too late, and decide to get my king to safety now. just to guard againt an intrusion by the bishop or knight.  attacking my undefended bishop, which now has to make a choice: to stay on the diagonal againt the king, or retreat? i don't want to lose it and leave black with the two bishops, and this seems about the safest place. getting ready for an f-pawn advance, something that looks a little dubious. black wants to exchange his centrally place knight, so i'm happy to oblige. looking at the board now, despite that early and unnecessary h-pawn advance, black doesn't have a bad position at all; i have a bit more space, but those two bishops have a couple of decent diagonals to play with, while mine has scurried home. i thought that f-pawn advance looked dubious, and it is. better was developing the dark-squared bishop, which can find a nice home on e5, via f6. now i could go on the attack, as the computer suggests , with 13.bd3, and suddenly that f-pawn is looking frail. instead i decide to exploit the opened diagonal against the king. i also have the possibility of getting rid of one of black's bishops. if he's going to give it up, it will be for a bishop, not a knight. but this doesn't really interfere with my plan... attacking the b-pawn and keeping the light-squared bishop at home to defend it, and threatening a nasty discovered check. the black king wisely steps out of the way. i'm allowing the knight back into the game, but i miss the computer's rather convoluted advantage... 15. exf5 rxf5 16. bxg5 nxg5 17. nxc7 qxc7 18. re8+ kh7 19. bd3 threatening a horrible fork on g6. black guards against it, but it's better done with the queen, getting both queen and rook on the same file. drawing out that bishop from c8 - black won't want to allow the check on g6. it means the bishop will be attacking my c-pawn, but he will lose the b-pawn inexchange... now i feel i have black on the run, attacking the c-pawn twice. and his bishop has opened the file against it as well. black is on the defensive. once i get rid of the bishop, i have three pieces on that weak c-pawn. however, i've missed the reply. chess is often about momentum, and at present i have it. better to continue with 20.qc6, which wins the weak pawn: 20...bf5 21.f4 bd7 22.qxc7 black has neatly turned the tables, and now, threatening my queen, i'm the one on the back foot. it also allows him to exchange a couple of pieces, rather neutralising my attack and heading into the phase of the game he's better at... one of those hard-to assess (for me) positions. but i probably do have it slightly better, despite those connected pawns in the centre; that a-pawn on a7 is going to be hard to defend. i start by trying to get the rook away from it. not a bad idea, and certainly not an error, but probably not the best plan... now i win the a-pawn and give up my b-pawn. i've now got a passed pawn and a bishop that covers the queening square. great. but the exchange has allowed black two passed pawns, something that is going to prove a problem later. at the moment, though, those pawns aren't going anywhere. black counters by threatening both bishop and pawn. i get the pawn out of the way; the bishop is already defended. however, once again i have lost momentum. a threat, and i think about defending the threat. better to keep the momentum going with counter-attacks on black's pieces - 28.h4, followed by 29.f3. not a serious problem, but once again black is seizing the initiative. black gets his rook in front of my passed pawn. and i get my rook behin d it, which is how it's supposed to be! the computer prefers the exchange before this move, for some reason. instead, it follows... i feel happy with the position; the black central pawns are blocked and i have the right colour bishop to cover the queening square. surely it's just a  matter of technique now? obviously i don't want to lose or exchange the bishop. the king must lose no time in getting across the board. and i must push that pawn whenever i can, especially if it means placing it on a white square... where it can be covered by the bishop. the rook is out of play for now! getting ready to go to b7, force an exchange of rooks, queen the pawn etc. ha. black strikes out with his own passed pawns. i decided it might be prudent to get my king off the back row, in case there's a point where both pawns queen. rather negative thinking, given my position. this actually gives me a chance, with 38.bc6, which, though it gives up the pawn, there follows 38...rxa6 39.re1+ and the knight falls. but i didn't see that, so focussed was i on queening that pawn! instead, i go the other way, geeting ready to force an exchange of rooks with 39.rb7+ black really ought to have pushed his pawn. 38… c3 39. ke3 c2 40. rc1 nc7 41. rxc2 kd8 and both pawns fall. with this move, i still have a chance. eh? when i look back at this move i wonder what i was thinking. did i just think it advanced the pawn to the 7th? clearly, the rook must be taken by the bishop, so it's still covering the queening square, and black will be forced to give up the knight for the resulting queen. then, i would have a bishop to help stop black's passed pawns, and a pawn majority on the k-side. it probably, might, have been enough to win. this way, it all goes awry. i later wondered how black managed to get a draw, and the answer is probably here. now black covers the queening square and there's not much i can do about it with those pawns advancing. my king can at least block them... and i still have that pawn majority to play with. hopefully i can lure the king away to the k-side, win the black pawns and head to b7 with my king. crafty; the knight isn't confined to covering the queening square. it can help drive my king back. once again, i have lost momentum and am being driven back. i wonder now if black had a win here? the computer says not, but black advances those pawns most skilfully... then he gets worried about my pawn majority, instead of pushing me further back with 48...c3+ black reasons that since my king can't do anything about the pawns, he can get rid of that majority. and he can! but i still get pawns too. still, his king has enough time to scurry back to my remaining pawn, hovering on the brink. however much i shuffle pieces, unless black drops a real clanger, it's drawn. hoping for 65...nxc6?? 66.kxc6 ka7 67.kc7 winning. nope. here i ceased scurrying about and accepted the draw.

je n'avais pas suspecté ce coup, pourtant simple, qui me met déjà sur la défensive.  nc6 aurait peut-être été mieux pour empêcher cette poussée de pion. voilà la grande diagonale, ce qui sera dure à contrer. je ne veux pas laisser g5 de disponible pour son cavalier ou son fou. ici, je voulais essayer de provoquer un échange de pion afin de diminuer l'effet de cette diagonale de pions. malheureusement pour moi, l'échange n'a pas eu lieu et le fou en e3 apporte un bon soutient à son attaque éventuelle.  ça commence à chauffer pour moi. ce coup me fait réaliser que je suis perdant au change.  si bxd6, dxc5 et je perd une grosse pièce.  même chose pour qxd6.  à ce stade ci, je décide de concéder 2 pions plutôt qu'une grosse pièce, en retirant mon fou.  peut-être y avait-il un meilleur coup? voilà, l'adversaire a pris ces 2 pions et me force à retirer mon cavalier. un autre sacrifice, les pions sont maintenant trop nombreux et près du but. excellent coup de mon adversaire.  en plus d'attaquer ma tour, le fou bloque la ligne de ma reine. je dois ouvrir une porte. après ce coup, je considère la partie terminée.  je continue quelques coups pour la forme.  
-------------------------------------
i call this game "pins and needles" because it is suspenseful (i think), and because there are many pins of pawns and pieces on both sides; and a few needles, meaning the needling, or bothering, of pawns and pieces that require defending. black will play the king's indian. duz-hotimirski-capablanca, moscow, 1925, continued: 6. qe2, nc6, 7. rd1, e5!, 8. dxe5, dxe5 [denker-kavalek, usa, 1976], 9. nc3=. if 6. e4, nbd7, 7. h3, c5, 8. c3, e5, 9. dxe5, dxe5, 10. a4, qc7, 11. na3, c4, advantage black.

-------------------------------------
   i thought i would try annotating one of my games as it has been a long while and i feel i have made progress since doing my last one. my biggest weakness in chess is in rushing my moves so i deliberately picked out an opponent who is playing 5 days per move, forcing me to slow down myself…so here goes…    to avoid a lot of theory i have a tendency to play the same three moves whether i’m playing black or white. it’s called the modern defence but i prefer to call it the rat. the crux of the strategy here is one of non-engagement. i allow my opponent free rein in the center so number one there are few forcing variations (a good way to avoid a lot of theory) , and two…i’m hopefully giving my opponent all the rope he needs to hang himself. i call this opening or system of development, ‘the rat reversed.’ in learning this system i took numerous beatings until i learned the importance of over-protecting e4 (as white, e5 when playing black). you can see this strategy here, as i have already protected my e4 square three times a somewhat innocuous move at first blush (i often play c3 here as well), but later on, this move will set up an offensive thrust on the queen-side. meanwhile my opponent continues to develop in classical style.     black attacks my queen, while developing another piece. you will notice that when you play this system you will come under attack early and often but with experience you will find that this system of development has a lot of hidden resources that go unnoticed if you don’t pay attention. this is an instructive position. black has fully developed all his pieces while white appears to be cramped and on the defensive. but taking control of the center uncontested entails the responsibility of maintaining it. i’m about to launch a counter-attack. a forcing move, his bishop has to retreat. b-h5 is probably not the best move here. this bishop can still be chased away with g4.    another forcing move, his other bishop has to retreat as well. meanwhile i’m gaining space on the queen-side while threatening his knight on c6 if i decide to push this pawn again. the battlefield has undergone a dramatic shift since the ‘instructive position’ after black castled on his 7th move. the strategy of this opening system is becoming clearer. i’m going to attack his center from the flanks with my bishops. while playing this system (at my level of competition), i have noticed that my opponents have a tendency to push their center pawns prematurely up the board. when this happens i like to push my other center pawn up as well, locking up the center. this often gives my knights attractive squares in the center to occupy. notice too i have not castled yet. by delaying castling my opponent will be uncertain where he should attack. if the center does get locked up, chances are i won’t castle at all..…my opponent continues to develop in the classical fashion. the pawn move, a6 was another possibility for black, protecting the b5 square from my b pawn. another pawn move which makes black move his queen’s bishop again. you can see i seem to be counter attacking on the wings while playing with a ‘restricted center’ in the middle of the board. my metallic kibitzer, komodo 8 (infinite analysis) prefers c4 or 0-0. it’s not that g4 is a bad move although maybe in retrospect i’m overextending myself on the kingside while attacking on the queenside as well..... if i had to do it over again i think i would play c4 and keep my king-side pawns back for now in case i eventually did decide to castle.....after thinking about this awhile c4 was definitely the move to make, by playing g4, i chased his bishop to a square where he was attacking my e4 square (my whole strategy in this system is to over-protect this strategic square).....if i had played c4 instead, i would have been attacking his d5 square, weakening his hold on e4. the whole course of the game would have been changed. i would have expanded on the queen side instead of the other side of the board. again the fault was in myself and not the opening system......or maybe i just should have just castled, chess can be a challenging game. when black moved his bishop to the g6 square on his last move, i noticed he was attacking my e4 square 4 times while i only had defended it three times. if your opponent manages to successfully occupy the e4 square its curtains for me. i have lived through this a number of times. that being the case i move my king’s knight to g3 where it additionally provides cover for this strategically important square. when you overprotect e4, your opponent will often push the other center pawn up the board. ko still thinks i should castle…..as expected my opponent pushes his queen pawn to d4. ko suggested h6 for black, protecting the g5 square. i’m sure his king’s knight would have appreciated the gesture.  i anticipated his pawn move to d5, so i move my pawn to e4, locking up the center. the resulting shift in the pawn structure shapes my strategy. i plan on making a king-side attack with my pawns supported by my knights while leaving my king in the center of the board...... ko prefers q-e2, a developing move. n-c4 was another possibility, increasing my presence on the queenside. one thing to keep in mind about e4, it does lock in my king’s bishop..... black’s knight move gives the base of his center pawn chain added protection in case i go for eventual pawn break on f4. now that the center is safely locked up i shifted my other knight over to the f3 square. i made this move quickly (actually i make all my moves quickly). ko had a bevy of other suggestions. he especially liked g5, and suggested h4, n-c4 and even o-o as well. but i had other ideas. this is the cost of moving too quickly and not taking all the nuances of the position in consideration. it’s not that n-f3 was an especially bad move, but i passed up other moves without even considering them. i saw a move i liked and tried to justify it to myself, a good example of confirmation bias.....a good idea here is when you settle on a move you want to make, try inverting your line of thinking and see what’s wrong with it.    ko preferred a5 to black’s a6 response, challenging me on the queenside.   i decide to push the attack on the king-side. if i move this pawn again, his bishop will be trapped. chess is as much as anything else, a psychological game. i want to give my opponent something to worry about and maybe frustrate him in the process. while nodding his head in approval, ko also suggests g5. i guess we’re both thinking a king side attack..... he also likes b-c1, providing additional support for the pawn advance on the kingside while improving the bishop’s effectiveness as well......  black replies f6, providing an escape square for his bishop, while giving his g5 additional support.   i forge on ahead, forcing him to move his bishop. once he does that i’m looking at n-f5 with my knight occupying a nice hole close to his king…sure enough he retreats the bishop…not bad i suppose, but ko suggests b-h3. the bishop move was an interesting alternative; it gives the bishop more scope while strengthening my grip on the f5 square (a square that’s in close proximity to the black king). he’s a pretty sharp kid this ko.   anyway black is forced to move his bishop to f7.  before replying right away i noticed that he could move his bishop to b-e6 attacking my g4 pawn. i thought about it…it seemed to me if i could trade off my knight for his bishop, it would be a good exchange for me. if that bishop stays there it’s going to hamper my attack. i’d like to get rid of it. my knights are also getting in the way of my heavier pieces so getting rid of one of them seemed like a good idea. i ran through a few variations and they left me with a good attacking position so i went ahead and made the move…..ko also likes g5 for me.....   black shifts his knight on c6 to e7 to help defend his king-side…maybe even force an exchange of my knight on f5…ko had a nice reply for black in a5, challenging me on the queenside, giving me something to think about, than my attack on other side of the board.     i add support to my attacked knight, moving my other knight from f3 to h4, opening up some space for my queen and eventually my bishop as well. notice too that after about 18 moves into the game, all the pieces and even the pawns are still on the board, a demonstration of the ‘non-engagement’ character of the rat. by avoiding direct contact with the enemy in the opening, variations become less important until the middlegame and even then there is more of an on emphasis on schematic thinking, piece placement and pattern recognition…..ko preferred o-o (king safety) and n-d2 (re-positioning my own knight with an eye on the queenside). looking back maybe n3-h4 cluttered up my kingside too much resulting in my pieces getting in each other’s way. in retrospect, i think this was the first of a series of sub-par moves on my part while my opponent was strengthening his position.....   meanwhile black moves his other knight over to f8 on the king side, to help in the defence of his king. it also now controls g6 so if i was to play h6 it would open up a hole for this knight. ko likes this move as well as the disruptive a5.    i move my queen’s bishop to a more active square so he can take part in the storming of black’s barricades..…ko also liked h6, pressing the attack.....   black moves his knight on f8 to a more active position, eyeing the strategic f4 square. the intentions of his eighteenth move have now seeing the light of day, a karpovian repositioning of the knight to take advantage of some of the holes left by my advancing pawns on the kingside. ko also liked a5, (breaking up my pawns on the queenside) but not as much as the move that was played.  time for my queen to get more involved in the assault, while adding additional cover for the f4 square…or so i thought at the time. looking back, this move spelled the beginning of the end for me......ko didn't consider this move in his top five suggestions, and is it my imagination or is my attack beginning to peter out here, funny how things look in retrospect...... ko likes r-b1, and in lieu of what happened on the queenside in the next couple of moves, it would have been a good idea. ko also likes b-d2, giving my b4 pawn more support..…i made that queen move awful quickly. one thing i have to learn is to take more time in evaluating the position in front of me before i commit to making a move.....  black counterattacks moving his queen’s rook to c8, threatening a pawn break at c5 disrupting my queenside. played through a few variations and things are getting troublesome…ko pointed out that black had a number of promising replies…both c5 and a5 break up my pawn structure on the queenside and with my king sitting in the middle of the board, black is actually outflanking me.     after much deliberation i decided to move my bishop to d2 to giving added support to my b4 pawn. my attack on the kingside seems to be fading fast. black’s last move has me worried. i can see what is coming on the queenside. remarkably, all the pieces are still on the board. i think black has the initiative..... ko prefers h6, still trying to stir things up on the kingside. nxe7+ and o-o are other ideas.....   black plays c5 seeking to breakthrough on the queenside. i ran through several variations and they all looked dangerous for me. i have to be careful here. if black breaks through on the queenside i have serious problems. ko endorses c5 as best. another possibility is n-g5, attacking my queen. black increases his advantage with every move.  i’m flustered as i feel things slipping away. chess is as much as anything else, a psychological game and i’m cracking here. b-f1 wasn’t the best move but i made it anyway…..ko prefers q-d1 and r-c1, both of which protect my vulnerable pawn on c2 which is the base of my pawn chain.....    black captures my pawn on b4 and my queenside collapses. my c2 pawn is now wide open and waiting for black’s rook to swoop down and gobble it up.    a reflex move, capturing the offending pawn but i’m done for now. the queenside will determine the outcome. i stop checking in with ko as things are plainly lost. i don't think he thought much of my move.....   black’s rook sweeps down and takes out my backward pawn on c2…the bombs are starting to burst and things are getting ugly. my demise is quick. chess is not a good game to lose but in order to enjoy you have to learn how to lose.  i resigned......   postscript…..   i seemed to have lost the thread of this game around move 18 (n3-h4). black was adjusting to the position on the board while i wasn’t. i should have paid more attention to the queenside and the safety of my king.....    frankly i move too fast and always have. by moving too quickly i often fail to understand all of the nuances of the position on the board. i also have a tendency to get so hung up on a singular idea that i fail to consider alternative moves......   there has been a difference of opinion on using chess engines to analyze your games. i think it depends on what engine you’re using and how you are using it. all of the engines are tactical monsters so i think you should try to analyze your games with an engine that puts more of an emphasis on positional play. komodo has a reputation for that, so that’s the engine i settled on. i’ve read that both shredder and hiarcs have a strong positional bent as well. i also think you should let the engine analyze for awhile (10 minutes or more), especially for positions that have a lot of moves that rated close together). and i think you should also try to figure out why the engine settles on a particular move. this can help you learn the positional nuances that are involved in a position.......   i will continue to use the rat as my opening system of choice. it did its job but i didn’t…..and congrats to my opponent, imiodrag who took his time with each move and taught me an additional lesson in patience......   as for komodo 8...you can go outside now and play with stockfish...

on sort des grandes lignes. sur ma compilation des twic (the week in chess), seules 3 parties sur 650.000 parties! la grande ligne est cc6 puis à égalité (fd6 plus les occurences du coup fe7) le coup le plus logique, protege le roi immédiatement, et la tour va ajouter de la pression sur la case e4 ou tout va se passer renforce la case e4 occupée par son ami le cavalier noir. c'était la case que thierry avait choisie pour ce cavalier en passant par d7. le fou c8 est libéré aussi. attaque bizarre que je ne comprends pas. prévoyait-il un échange en e4? renforce e4 ajoute encore de la pression sur e4 le fou sort de l'attaque de la dame, et la contraint à bouger.  a la place j'aurais joué dd7 pour renforcer la position du fou et sortir la dame de sa 8eme rangée. d'ailleurs rybka aussi, bien qu'au début de son analyse, il fasse comme toi. ahh non, il change d'avis rybka au bout d'une profondeur de 14, il fait comme toi, bon...  pourquoi ce coup? quelle est ta stratégie à ce moment là? sans doute que tu as pensé que la position en e4 n'était plus tenable (trop d'attaquants?) rybka aurait simplifié en échangeant cxg5 continue le développement basique ''interroge'' le cavalier (comme ils disent dans les commentaires de 'pros') élimine le cavalier qui serait gênant en e5, contre un fou qui ne trouve pas sa place et bloque un peu les autres pièces attaque g7. en plus les noirs ne peuvent plus roquer a cause du clouage si le fou c1 prend le pion défenseur qui est avancé en h6 plan classique après l'ouverture basique des blancs bien joué, c'est bien embêtant comme pion! mais rybka aurait joué ch5 tout de suite ah, je comprends maintenant, c'est là que tu voulais placer ta reine depuis le début, non? c'est une de tes armes habituelles? ce coup semble logique car il met en jeu le fou au 'centre' et contre ta dame, pourtant l'ordi n'aurait pas fait ça... roque de ce côté, car le petit roque est compromis coup compréhensible: attaque double sur le fou d7, et en même temps sur le pion h6 le fou s'échappe de l'attaque et se place à un endroit stratégique et se rapproche du roi adverse pour le combat final le coup violent, mais qui ne marche que si les blancs prennent avec le pion h en plus, comme les noirs n'ont pas tout de suite repris leur pièce en c4, il faudra penser à la sortie de combinaison pour le faire dégage le fou de l'attaque de la tour, et 'force'  de façon peu élégante mais efficace les échanges pour passer en finale avec une piece de plus dommage que ton cavalier en g3 n'ait pas été plus dangereux dans les tactiques à la fin, ça aurait pu faire des dégâts...

english opening. symmetrical. what uncomfortable players play. so do i... referred to as hedgehog system. this is off the main line. we classically see 3. d4 cxd4. my opponent maybe tries to open ways for the c bishop aiming at my c pawn. but watch out! the diagonal is open to the a rook as well. keep this in mind. simply developing without any weird idea, i promise. opening ways for the queen now? putting pressure on d4 while preparing for castling. preparing for castling too, but no pressure of any kind. a gentle move? not exactly. the bishop is already in position to aim at the king side. still trying to castle king-side. this was in the air. so was this. pushing pawn because it's time for the battle. this was a bit puzzling, i confess. probably 8. ... nc6 would have been a better move, putting pressure on the center. still pushing pawn and going to exchange. now i have advantage in the center. please note there's no advantage in pieces. trying to escape to the front line. a classical response would be ... h3. but this was not in my mind. i move my queen because i want to take control of the e column. of course qe4 is now so tempting for the next move... a poor move. i figure out my opponent was avoiding a move of my f knight. turning on the fast forward now. remember the freed diagonal after 3. … b6? payback time! at this point, what do you see at first? i'd say, there's the evidence: a fork on rook and knight. what can he do? moving the rook - the knight is dead. moving the knight - the rook is dead. as you will see, he will choose to make some mess in my defence with his knight while losing his rook, and win a tempo to move his knight back. but... there's something else. my queen and d knight are now aligned. this means that i will no longer consider taking pieces and preferably will rely on my position advantage. making some mess and waiting for his rook to die. fatal attack in 2 moves. the purpose of this annotation was to set forward the most important role of a good position, letting pieces for what they are: consolation.

johndyson is a hard opponent. he is an experienced player with an impressive record. i am particularly proud of this game because it shows how positional advantage can be converted into victory.  this sets the scene - the pawn structure for the middle game is this: it's white's pawn supremacy on the queen's side, black's advantage on the king side.  white has a nice development. computer analysis shows that white has a small advantage.  white's focus is on fast development.  weakening the black pawn structure on the king's side.  starting the pawn advance.  the rook belongs on the half-open file.  the black queen advance threatens with many difficulties. i analyzed in-depth a sacrifice of the b2 pawn, which leads to complications. black rejects the sacrifice.  the black queen continues to move around. the pawn advance at this point brings the added benefit of restricting its mobility.  after long analysis, i determined that the exchange of the queen tends to lead to an equalized play.  the pressure on the queen side pays out. now white's pawn advantage is getting very big.  white can now develop an initiative. i was a little bit uncertain, however the main idea was to get the queen out of the way, possibly preparing for a king side surprise attack, and bringing the knights to the center in order to pressure the point d6.  while the tactical position of white continues to improve, the pawn structure on the king side seems now secured for white, as well.  through tactical maneuvers, white has managed to get a passed pawn.  this is a clear winning position for white.  computer analysis shows:  inaccuracy: +2.78 » … rh5 47. rd1 ke6 48. re1+ kf6 49. re4 g5 50. kg2 rh6 51. ree7 rh7 52. rf7+ best: +2.01 » … rd5 47. rfc1 rd2+ 48. kf1 rd6 49. r1c6 rxc6 50. rxc6+ ke5 51. rc7 kd6 52. rxg7 kc6 53. rxg6+ kxb7 54. rf6 rd8 55. rxf4 rd2 56. rf7+ kc6 computer analysis shows:  inaccuracy: +3.26 » … rbh8 49. rd6+ ke5 50. rxg6 rh1+ 51. kf2 r1h2+ 52. rg2 rxg2+ 53. kxg2 rb8 54. rxg7 kd6 55. kh3 kc6 56. b5+ axb5 57. axb5+ kb6 58. kg4 rxb7 best: +2.36 » … rb2 49. rd6+ kg5 50. b5 axb5 51. rb6 rd8 52. rxb5+ rxb5 53. axb5 rb8 54. rf7 kh6 55. b6 g5 56. kg2 kg6 computer analysis shows:  mistake: +4.74 » … kc6 56. kg4 rxb7 57. rxb7 kxb7 58. kxf4 kc6 59. ke5 kc7 60. f4 kb6 61. kd5 a5 62. b5 kb7 63. f5 kb6 64. ke6 best: +3.25 » … kc4 56. b5 a5 57. rf7 kb4 58. rxf4+ kc5 59. re4 rxb7 60. kg4 rg7+ 61. kf4 rd7 62. kg5 kd5 63. re8 kc5 64. kf6 rd2 65. re7 kb4

i am white now once again, thematic(done right now) 2 o-os in a row! i know the notation looks weird... ?? bye bye rook discovered check with fork bye bye queen the sacrifice. i hoped it would work. nope! +8 get out of my life, knight! he’s smarter than that now mr. knight is pinned! ? blocked not for long. checkmate!!

fork guarded by rook bad queen move no more black queen forgot about the rook random pawn move get rid of bishop didn’t take the rook checkmate

the queen pawn games are quickly replacing e4 as the 1st move of choice at top level of play.   queens gambit declined one of my favorites. it has the rep of being a quiet game but it does have some very flashy variations.    the fashionable choice that avoids the nimzo-indain.   semi-slav is a very solid defensive choice.   wow ratkop is playing like his mentor(which is me) this is exactly what i play most of the time. as i always say to my students consolidating your centre and develop your pieces is paramount.   discouraging potential king side play by black via ...nh5  !? not my choice of move. for one it greatly reduces the tension in the center which benefits black more than white. secondly, white makes a pawn move when there are pieces that need developing. i would have played 8. qc2  alternative variation: 8. qc2 dxc4 9. bxc4 b5 10. bd3 [⩲]  it is good to see that white has a clear simple plan here. his idea is to gain space on the queen side with the hope of creating a passer later on.   nice move, appreciating the fact that black may wish to open the e-file at some point. but it creates a significant weakness on f2.   the centre is closed and subtle manoeuvrings to improve your pieces becomes the priority. lets see how white does.   so far so good. now any opening of the position should benefit white.   white has great potential on the queen side which is counter by black's advancing  f-pawn. still white has the poorly placed knight on f1 which he will have to resolve before getting on with the attack. all that being said the game can go in either direction. long term i like white's chances.   !? alternative variation: 17... rf7 [!?] 18. ne3 nf8 19. ncd1 ne6 20. g3 bxe3 21. nxe3 ng5 [⩱]  ?! trading the dsb when your major weakness is on the dark squares(f2) is not a good idea. alternative variation: 19. rab1 axb5 20. axb5 ng8 21. nd1 ndf6 22. nfe3 [⩲]  exposing the weakness of f2  ?! alternative variation: 22. nd1 [only move] 22... qf6 23. qc3 nc7 24. rc2 ne6 25. rd2 ng5 26. nfe3 [⩱]  white is in serious trouble.   white's road to salvation is down the b-file but will it be enough!  nice active defensive in a desperate situation. at least white is giving black something to think about!   ?? alternative variation: [ ⌓ ] 28... nc7 29. kg1 qh6 30. h4 a5 31. rc2 qg6 32. qe1 [−⁠+]  and white is back in the game.   ?! alternative variation: [ a draw by rep is ] 33... nf6 34. be2 kg8 35. qd1 h5 36. qf1 bd7 37. qf4 rf8 38. bxa6 ne8 39. qg5 qf7 40. qf4 qe6  alternative variation: 35. qf8+ [!?] 35... kh7 36. qd6 qxd6 37. cxd6 nb5 38. bxb5 axb5 39. rxc6 [±]  ?? alternative variation: 37... qg8 38. qxg8+ kxg8 39. bxc8 rxc8 40. nc2 [=]  ?? alternative variation: 39. rxc6 bxg4 40. nxg4 kg7 41. nxf6 nxd4 42. nh5+ kg8 43. rg6+ kf7 44. rg7+ ke6 45. nf4+ kf6 46. rh7  alternative variation: 40... h5 41. h4 e3 42. rxa6 kg6 43. nxe3 nxd4 44. rb6 nf3+ 45. kf2 [⩲]  ?? the losing blunder.   excellent endgame technique by white.   white finally creates his passer and wins the game. the rest is an exercise in endgame play. well done by white.   ratkop pulls a rabbit out of his hat! well done.  
-------------------------------------
this game was in a scandinavian defense mini-tournament.   the main line.   ?! not a book move and very passive, blocking the light squared bishop. more common is 3.nc3.   taking control of the center.   ? wastes a tempo. ...bb4+ is not a threat here.   continuing with development.  ? another tempo waste.  ? gives up the bishop pair for nothing.  ? blocks in the f1-bishop even further, and allows my next move.  violates the principle, 'move every piece once before you move any piece twice unless there is a tactic,' but this move does not lose a tempo because white's queen is forced to move again and keep an eye on the c2 square. my knight position improves, but white's queen position does not, so this is a free beneficial move.  preparing queenside castling. i want my rook on the d-file.  gk computer says this is an inaccuracy because of 11...bg5 12.qd1 f5, but what if 12.qxg5? then 12...nxc2+ wins a rook, but there likely would be tactical complications with open lines on the kingside and the a1 knight trying not to get trapped. i considered 11...bg5 but preferred a lead in development, pressure, active pieces, and the bishop pair to being up the exchange with complications.  should i have played 11...bg5? is it better?  ?! wastes a tempo in my opinion. i would have tried to get the f1 bishop out via g3, rg1, and bg2.  this move turns the f1 bishop into a tall pawn on the 1st rank, and clears the path of the d8-rook.  logical move, trades a 2nd rank knight for a 5th rank knight.  i recaptured this way to make my rook more powerful.  the f1 bishop is completely useless now.  doubling rooks to increase the pressure on the d-file.  threatening 17...bg5 then ...f5 and ripping open the center.  unblocking the f-pawn to prepare ...f5 and an attack in the center.  as planned.  i changed plans and now target white's king.  trying to restrain the kingside/central attack.  pawn storm. my pieces' activity and open lines compared to white's passivity and blocked pieces means that my king is safe while white's king is not.  logical follow up.  ? computer says best was 22.axb4 bxb4 and only a small disadvantage for white.  ripping open white's king shield.  the a-pawn prepares to advance and attack the weak b3-pawn.  attacking. my advantage is 3.56 pawns.  ? best was 25.nc1. this costs white about 1 pawn worth according to the computer.  26.c3 fails to 26...qb3+.  ?? loses to the computer recommended next move.  ?? logical move: attack the king, win material, simplify, then win the endgame. but better was 26...qc4!! and 27.dxc4 loses so computer gives best play as 26…qc4 27.kb1 bc3 28.dxc4 rxd1+ 29.nc1 rxe1 30.qxe1 bxe1.  loses the f3 pawn but it makes no difference already.  if 29.dxe4, then 29...rd1!  preparing a discovered check.  ?? 30.c3 was much better according to computer.  if 32.rxd1 then 32...rxd1+ wins a queen for a rook.  ?? 33...rd1+ and mate in 12! but simplification is good enough to win.  opponent resigns.  
-------------------------------------
molto interessante per lo sfruttamento della posizione nella mossa 17. vittoria con un pezzo in meno, bel finale! ok, qui il piano � anche quello di bloccare la donna nera. con a5, il blocco � mortale. ma il nero ha modo di rispondere cd5.  a questa, ho gi� analizzato che bisogna muovere l'alfere a h2 per non perdere un tempo preziosissimo se il nero spinge f5-f4.  la mossa complementaria delle bianche � dd3.  se viene giocata prima, il nero risponde cd5, il bianco ritira l'alfiere in h2, e adesso la donna si pu� ritirare solo in a5, e da l� con tb5 vince, perch� poi prende il cavallo d5.  il nero ha una mossa per parare questo inconveniente, e la pi� aggressiva (a parte ritirare la donna in b4 subito, e poi impedire tb5 con a6), f5-f4.  il dubbio, qui, � se ritirare il cavallo o di lasciarlo, giocando tfb1. se f5xce4, dxe4 e la risposta naturale, cf6, mi fa perdere un tempo prezioso, ma alla fine nessuno mi potr� impedire di prendere, prima o poi, il pedone in c3.  se il cavallo si ritira, per esempio in g3 (la pi� brutta), non pu� ancora ritirare la donna in d6, perch� con cf5 poi mangio l'alfiere in g8, lasciandomi con un finale vantaggioso. se invece la ritira in a5, per continuare a difendere il pedone, con tb1 continuo l'attacco. prevedibilmente a6, ac4 e la mia posizione � migliore.  se invece il cavallo si ritira avanzando a c5, la mia minaccia rimane, ma se gioca b6, il mio cavallo va a b3, e comunque non � male.  errore, errore! ma questa non l'aveva vista, secondo me. e neanche questa. la mitica coppia di alfieri... perch� mangiare questa torre in particolare? lo vedrete nel prossimo capitolo.  errore, errore. bisognava proteggere la colonna c, togliere di l� il cavallo.  raggiunto lo scopo: un pezzo in meno, ma i pedoni centrali sono forti.  incredibile, no? 
-------------------------------------
esempio di un finale di cavalli e pedoni, quasi da studio, che non so analizzare bene e tuttora non so se potevo fare patta. example of a knight and pawns final that i couldn't manage accurately. i still don't know if i could have reached drawn or not.  ho perso imperdonabilmente un tempo con l'alfiere bianco. forse potevo essere coerente con b3, ma lasciavo la diagonale aperta all'alfiere nero, e questo mi � sembrato troppo pericoloso.  ecco. non so capire se � meglio a4xb5 o ae2. e siamo arrivati a una certa stabilit�. adesso, passata la "tempesta", il mio schema di pedoni � pi� debole di quello delle nere, cosa che mi coster� la partita. un peccato, ma difficile da prevedere sin d'ora.  niente paura, recupero il pedone.  incredibile, lui ha i pedoni separati, eppure io non ho modo di difendere il pedone in g! che lezione di finale. e qui perdo il pedone in g. quindi, non mi � restato altro da fare che cercare di complicare un po' le cose.  e adesso c'� una bellissima lotta per fermare il pedone nero. forse un errore. dovevo cercare comunque i conquistare c6 per il mio re. queste posizioni sono un po' al di l� della mia capacit� di analisi.  errore. dovevo tenere duro con cf4.

its little bite inaccuracy move:5... bb4 better was 5...nbd7. because of after 5....bb4?6. bd3 o-o 7. bd2 c5 8. o-o dxc4 9. bxc4 nc6 10. a3 bxc3 11. bxc3 ne4 12. dxc5 nxc3 13. bxc3! and whits position better. the whites dsb is blocked on c1-h6 diagonal because of pawn e3 which blocked by the black knight on e4, i decided to develop the bishop to much more use full place like a3, this is long and very effective for the white dsb to move . white now all most developed all he's pisces while black still behind with he's development . black wishes to close whits lsb long diagonal and trays to exchange one of the bishops followed by 11...dxc4.12.bxc4-nxc4.13.qxc4.....  but still black must finished he's development . the center now totally controlled by whites pisces . now , white takes advantage of he's space , by forcing the black knight to retreat to passive position which we saw in the game , 17.e5!-nd5.18.c4!-nd7(18..nf4 was leading to 19.qe4-ng6 another lose of tempo . according to whites space and center control , white can maneuver he's pisces to more stronger position while black still struggles with him self by standing behind with he's development .  the maneuver begins ,19.nd2-e4. black wishes to open the c8-a6 diagonal and try to start any kind of contra play on the queen side but does he have enough time to do it . that's mistake because of : 22 … qh4 23. rg3 kh8 24. ng5 hxg5 25. rh3 red8 26. rxh4+ gxh4 27. qb3 rd7 28. f4 rc7 29. kf2 rd7 30. ke3 rad8 31. ke4 c5 best move: 22 … rec8 23. rg3 kh8 24. nd6 rc7 25. qa3 bb7 26. qf3 rb8 27. qh5 rd8 28. rb1 rcd7 29. c5 bxc5 . butt still white have advantage.  another mistake:25 … qe7 26. qa3 bb7 27. rxg7 c5 28. qg3 rad8 29. qg6 fxg6 30. rxe7 bc6 31. dxc5 kg8 32. rxe6 be4 33. c6 bxc6 34. rxg6+ kh7 best move was : 25… f6 26. qa3 qh5 27. f3 bc8 28. nxc8 raxc8 29. exf6 gxf6 30. qxa7 rg8 31. qxb6 rxg3 32. hxg3 qf5 the beauty is if 27...kxg7.28.nf5+and the black queen is trapped after 28...exf.29.qxe7 and black under heavy attack. the end is near ..... tow pisces scarifies leads to un stoppable mate in 4 moves ... .. and black resigns : after 32...kh7.33.qxf5+kh8.34.qf6+-kh7.35. qg7# and if 32...kh8.33.qxh6#  i hope you enjoyed the game !!

je pousse le pion pour contrer l'éventuelle ligne du fou. je ne voulais pas jouer nf3, car cela aurait pu engendrer dxe5, suivi de dxe5 et qxd1 pour l'échange de dame qui me faisait perdre mon roque.  en jouant ce coup, il est clair que je perd un pion.  kf3 aurait probablement été plus efficace. je ne me suis pas méfié de ce coup, car je croyais le cavalier clouer.  je n'ai pas remarqué que je pouvais être en échec.  j'ai hésité beaucoup entre ce coup et l'échange de reine. je crois que j'ai été impatient avec ce roque, qui après analyse me semble très dangereux.  ng3 aurait été plus efficace, cela aurait forcé une série d'échange ou le retrait de sa reine. ce coup me semblait la seule option pour pouvoir dégager ma reine sans donner le cavalier avec connaissance de la fin de cette partie.  il est clair que ce coup était mauvais.  qc2 aurait été mieux n'ayant pas vu la ligne entre son fou et sa reine.  
-------------------------------------
j'aime mieux protéger mon pion que de prendre le pion adverse.  ainsi après un échange de pion éventuel, les 2 pions restent face à face devant les dames. pour empêcher nb5. encore une fois, pour empêcher ng5 ou bg5. j'ai hésité avec nc6, mais j'ai préféré préparé le terrain du côté du roque. ce coup permettait également de protéger mon fou. j'essai de repousser la dame. je n'aimais ma position pour roquer à cause du fou et de la dame sur la même ligne. je veux pousser mes pions vers l'avant dans le but d'ouvrir un côté du jeu.  je garde la possibilité du grand roque. je n'avais pas remarqué que le fou pouvait s'amener.  je m'attendais à dxe5.  ce coup m'a débalancé et je dois déplacé ma tour (les espace sont assez limité) le cavalier est perdu, j'essai de provoquer un échange avec le fou. je voulais roqué, mais j'ai remarqué que nxb6 et je ne peux reprendre le cavalier avec le pion à cause de la dame qui clou le pion (si je roque).  j'ai donc décidé de concentrer l'action de l'autre côté du jeu. je n'avais vraiment pas prévenu ce coup.  je voyais seulement hxg4. j'ai pris le cavalier, car si la dame vient prendre mon fou, ma tour prendre le fou en g6. je sens que mes coups sont comptés.  après analyse du jeu peut-être que nf6 aurait été plus efficace.  dommage de l'avoir vu après. encore là, je ne sais pas pourquoi je n'ai pas simplement pris le fou (kxh6)?? je me suis auto-squeezé.  je n'ai pas le choix, je dois enlever un fou. un coup du désespoir.  ce fou protège tout de même la diagonale noire. j'essai d'échanger les dames, cela enlèverai une menace. évidemment... qf7 aurait été mieux sur le coup précédent. je tente une dernière attaque avec les fous. (en espérant que l'adversaire aille en e1 pour un beau mat) malheureusement, mon jeu a été déjoué.

hi everyone!  this was a real roller-coaster of a game.  i decided it was time to challenge mike again.  here are my current stats against him +0, won: 47 (48%), lost: 47 (48%), draws: 2 (2%), 96 games.  so despite the 200 point difference in our rating we are pretty evenly matched and will have soon played 100 games against each other!  mike has been inflicting a lot of passivitis on me in a lot of my games against him with different eventual outcomes.  in this game it is no different, through a large part of the middlegame, mike has me tied down.  glenda briefly leads a break out rally but she is exchanged off and mike re-establishes his bind with a bone in the throat and more.  mike releases the bind and there follows a race to the promotion square and wins the race by just one move.  i am also a pawn down.  but will glenda be able to save the day here?  please feel free to read the ga below to find out or simply read on.  mike starts with 1. c4 as he often does and i reply with f5 transposing the game into an anglo-dutch defense. 2.e4 - a gambit. 2...… fxe4 - accepted. 3. ….. nf6 - development and defends the extra pawn. 6. nxe4 - mike however wins it back. 9. hxg3 - knight trade. 9. ……. dxc4 - this is becoming like a qga! 11.rh2 - mike takes his rook out of the line of glenda's fire and threatens bb2. 12. ….. bg4 - pin. 15. ….. qf7 - glenda has to move but i am hoping to move her again to a more aggressive square later. 19. rxa7 - mike regains material equality and gives me a bone in the throat - aaargh and double aargh! 19. ….. 0-0 - well, i have finally done something about henry, but i will also need to do something about glenda - firstly watch out for a pin on the g8-a2 diagonal from mike's light square bishop! 22. ….. nb8 - this sorry knight will be imprisoned on this square for many moves to come.  its job at the moment is to cover the c6 square. 25. ra8 - maintaining control with a pin on my b8 knight. 30. …… bxd4 - an attempt to break out with a plethora of exchanges. 31. ….. qb4+ glenda joins in the fun and now mike's pawn on b2 comes under attack. 34. bxe4 - queen trade. 36. kxe3 - bishop trade. 39. ……. nd7 - the knight finally moves but now mike is about to give me a hell of a bind!  42. …… rf7 - either that or g7. 43. ……. re7 - the defensive shuffles carry on.  now mike releases the bind and gives me a pawn deficit.  here it comes! 48. kf6 - and now a decisive penetration by king mike.  i have my finger hovering over the resign button here but suddenly i have a better idea! 50. …… ke4 - the answer is henry lunching on mike's f4 p(r)awn. 52. …… e5 - the promotion race now begins. 56. ….. e1/q - boy am i glad to see glenda - she increases my chances of avoiding defeat from zilch to slender! 60. ……. qd8 - if glenda can get closer to king mike she can harass him betimes! 63. …… kh4?? - this move should have lost me the game according to ga.  thankfully mike overlooks this continuation and played 64. qe4+? 66. qf6? - this move throws away the win and brings the match to a dramatic finish. 68. ke5 - if kg6 glenda just checks him again on h5 and it will lead to perpetual check.   69. ……. kxg5 - after all the fireworks just the two kings are left on the board - a draw by dead game - even though i have conceded a low draw here (thankfully the game was unrated) things could have been so much worse so it is certainly a case of wheew and triple wheew! 
-------------------------------------
the biggest mistake beginners make in chess to develope the queen to early. normally when the queen comes out, the other player may develope for free by attacking it which results in a early offensive buried by a flood of enemy pieces. but in this case, it works and i´m going to try here to explain why.  up till this point this has been a standard queen´s pawn opening, i think this variation is called the keres defense. black however makes an early mistake here. white will not take this pawn, as it will obstruct black´s developement to no end.  this move is also bad. black is utterly clogged. no knights are out. his f8 bishop is bottled up. worse, his c8 bishop is in no position to do anything. in this situation, white can exploit the clog by qa4 since black has no means to threaten it.  black is now in deep trouble. his white bishop is trapped. he has to get a piece out on the board other than a pawn. perhaps qf6 is the best option for black here since it forces white to play defense on the right side and at least slows down the pressure.  i have no idea why black did this. bg5 would immediately be taken the queen. the threat is to black´s left side, not the right.  black latches unto a stratedgm here. since he can´t get at the queen he´s going to get the king to opposite side of the board. then he can finally move his d pawn and roll the queen back.  black needs to get the knight out and this slows that down. if he moves the knight, white takes pawn and the knight has to move again instead of being able to castle.  so he takes it.. which is just as problematic.  will black see qb6? it´s not an optimal move, but it will at least take the pressure off.  black is still committed to castling. unfortunately bxf4 prevents that. notice here that in 4 moves since the queen is out and black still hasn´t been able to threaten it. as an asside, in chess it pays to jettison fixed plans. qb6 needed to happen. castling looks tempting, but black needs to put pressure on white´s line.  oh dear. qb6 no longer the move you want to make. nb5 cuts it off, and the pawn prevent traps black´s queen. but there isn´t much by way of alternatives. any move other than qb6 and the bishop is toast. pull the bishop back and his castling plan is derailed.  too late.  the queen is pinned, the rook is forked.  this is the right choice for black, but loses the bishop. white also doesn´t need that pawn, pawns deep in enemy territory need defending. this makes them liabilities more often than not.  black still trying to get the bishop out. however this basically gives white an opportunity to pick up more material by realizing check. black should have taken the pawn, which still gives him the power to bring the rook into play. and he can easily pull the king back to 8 file in case of check, which white could not have attempted anyway.  yup yup.  this is better than nc7. white now needs to castle. this frees up the bishop and shields the pawn. plus, black cannot stop nc7 at his point anyway.   note.. 13 moves in and black still hasn´t threatened white´s queen.  black attempts to conserve the piece perhaps?  no need to castle when the king can be useful defense. nc7 requires the bishop to move, and the e pawn needs to be defended.  too late! on move 18 white´s queen is finally threatened. white's queen however is not serving a purpose though, from here on out the main action is going to be on the e file. never put a queen in front of a king.     the rooks are lined up without needing to castle. if the king is well defended there is no reason why you can't advance him up a file to preserve tempo, especially when it helps defensively.  king tries to get clear which not a bad plan but the tempo is not with black on this one.  obvious pawn push.  this is why the queen can be a liability, the worst situations i've found myself in are when people can take a piece and realize an attack on the queen.  queen  kg3 of course was the right move. black puts together a good combination of moves here to convert this into an exchange instead of a slaughter.  now its an exchange.  the problem though is that when you are 8 points down, you are still losing even if it's an innovative piece exchange black resigned. black put together a smart exchange at the end to prevent white from converting this into a route, but attrition still gets him in the end. (and he loses the knight after kxe8 anyway).   moral of the story. opening with the queen can be good, provided black cannot threaten it. in fact, a queen in an unreachable spot gives white a lot of good attacking options. another good moral here is the importance of paying attention in the opening. manage those pawns carefully, keep the files open to get the bishops or knights in a way that is helpful!   as always, i´d like to thank black for a fun game.

queen pawn. one of the most popular replies. developing. wanting to play c4. develops the bishop. protected. putting pressure on the d5 pawn. some think prefer the bishop over knight, thus not liking this move. i see no problem with it. awww, man. another pin?? threatening qxb7, which i now realize only wins a pawn after bxf3 9. qxb7 nbd7 10. gxf3. not wanting to double pawns. i think black should be trying to find a way to threaten the knight on f3, not wasting moves like this. not wanting the bishop pinning my knight anymore, i threaten the bishop and force it to swap or retreat. finally castles. g5 threatens the knight protecting the pawn on d5, then i can win the pawn. queen swap or free pawn… or both. i like this move. meh. after capturing the bishop i will no longer have doubled pawns on the b-file, because i will win take the knight with my pawn on b2. liking my position. good move, the pinned pawn is under pressure. okay. after the knight retreating, i will eliminate the pawn on c6 and win the pawn on d5, and if the pawn on e6 takes back i will capture it, pinning rook to rook. now for the free pawn. i will receive another free pawn. beautiful. the pawn threatens the knight and the bishop threatens the rook. i am now in a very good position. threatening and protecting. i don't know why i did this. swaps rooks. wanting to get rid of all the rooks and dominate with minor pieces. with doubled up pawns, it is now pretty much a bishop, a king and five pawns against a king and four and a half pawns. wanting to get my king into the action. the most important and protected piece is deadly in the endgame. this doesn't do much. wanting the pawns on b6 and a5. the king can only defend one of the groups: g5, f5 and g6 or: a5 and b6. the king goes for the smaller group. the pawn is unable to be saved, and my opponent resigns.

i always play this move in order to safely place my black bishop on f4, without fearing nh5. i just consider this bishop too valuable to get it changed or retired. but i am a "self made opening" player, i must admit. this is the typical risky-move that costed me a lot of reasoning, and maybe i was wrong.  the situation worths some advice, but is not the particular item i am really interested in, in this play.   the plan is to take advantage of the weak c6. i even considered the sacrifice of the rook h1, in some variants.  i played this in order to get a bishop against a knight, forcing queen's exchange, in order to enter in an endgame with an edge due to doubled and isolated pawn, the d column supported by my bishop, and the weakness of e4...  i thought black cannot defend c6 but taking my knight with bd6xe5. i planned this from the moment i moved my bishop to b5. after this, queen exchange is forced since the black knight is pinned. that leaves me with a rook on my d column, and his knight is not in a comfortable position: if it goes to h5, it's only plan can be to move f6, allowing to exchange my doubled e5 pawn. i think it would have been the better move for this knight. my counterplay is the weakness of his pawn in e4. if he defends it with f5, it leaves a good diagonal for my bishop, even if it has to retire in g3. it points to c7, and if this pawn is moved, to b8.  thank to another comment, i now realize that black can put his queen in b8. i dind't see it as a possibility, i just saw he has to take away his knight.  i got it! i'm better now! i lost the queenside castling, though. queen castle is not so important, since the b column is open for him. though, he cannot take too much advantage of it. with the castling, b2 is defended by my king and if he want to use his pawns to attack, it is a long journey and it would be easy for me to defend.  in order to complement the 13� move's considerations, his knight can go to d5, blocking the d column to my rook action (aiming to d8), and threatening an attack on my queen's pawns. but i again can defend it easily with rook d4, that both takes the e4 pawn and prevents kb4. he can go on with c5, supporting his knight, to which i could have answered a3.  this leaves the time for him to castle, but if he does so, i would have played rook g1, threatening bishop h6, and planned to advance my h pawn too. i think it would have been his best plan, though. after he puts his rook in d8, i would have allowed he to exchange rooks, and my king could participate in the defence of my queen-side pawns.  of course, it will take time to get something of this. but e4 (or c7) is mine! true or false? as predicted... i forsaw this.  the "simple" answer was c4. he cannot play f5 because of e5xf6. but, if he now plays na4, i will have let him enter and play against my king, so... now i can play it, because he has to lose a time in order to retire the rook. ok, now... how to go on? the "logical" one was b2-b3. but i feared some problems with the black a pawn. beside, with b2-b3 he could castle, and this will give him some peace, so i played more aggressively. but was i right?  he cannot castle, this is for sure! now, b2-b3 is not possible, because of nc3. but i had more tricks on my sleeve! if nxb3, rb1 and he must lose his knignt due to b8 ... now... can i really "trust" that? how can i know? this is a mistake, i think. he just wanted to get his king to h7, but it is too large a journey. typical comments i would expect to read on a "professional" review:  "solidifying the central pawns" / "trapping the bishop with his own pieces". both are "true", but none makes real sense to me, they just "sound good" :-) and probably a better plan was kf3, and if rd3, ke4 etc.   thank you for helping me get my bishop to a stronger position... :-) note that the chessmate still exists with the rook in h8, so he cannot take the b2 pawn. now he can take b2. rb1 doesn't work because of rxh4, and i cannot take the knight because of rh2 .  i didn't see that the previous is wrong. he still cannot take the b2 pawn, as after rxh4, i play rg2! and nothing can save him from losing a piece and more defending from mate in b8-h8. now, i realized it afterwards, thanks to somebody else. thanks a lot, and what a shame... so, my intention to change rooks and then take advantage of the open and free g column, thinking i will eventually take the black h5 pawn, and using my a4 pawn to win, was unnecessary.  rh-g1 was the best option. if black defends by rxr, hxr and then rh1 threats mate again... and if black defends rh6, h5 will smash him some way or another.  staying calm... the g1 check is wotrthless. to be able to say that, i spent a lot of time analyzing variants such rg1 , kh7. 29. rg5, kh6. it comes to a stall, so i explored 30. f5, d6xef5, 31. rxf5. but... then?  looking for the a or b column with my rook is worthless, since the black king escapes through white squares... unless my king or central pawns can stop it! it wouldn't have happened if i didn't exchange rooks, so 27. rxr was a mistake! taking away my king from the second row, i have a time more in order to make something on the g column. my position is very delicate, due to the weak pawns on the a and c columns. still, rook g2 can give me something, in addition to my king. but i must accept the penetration of his rook on my field... this is incoherent. yes, he loses the f7 pawn if he doesn't play it, but in the meanwhile he can do much harm on my a and c pawn, and i calculated a lot of variants in which he threats me with his c pawn. my advance of the central pawn, even without f7, is slower. is this correct? the check is now useless. ok. kh7 is forced. then, i considered bf8, in order to take c5 if he moves his knight. and if he plays re8, i give check with rxh5 . now, if kg8, be7 and i win. but if kg6, rh8. he must act quickly, so he plays f6 (or f5) in order to get his king closer and take my bishop. then i take in f6, and if he does kf7, rh7  and he cannot take the bishop because of rh8 , and his rook is lost (and the game also, if i am right).  if he takes f6 instead of the bishop, re7  and he must exchange rooks, then bxc7 must win (almost sure). the best for him is kg8, but even so, be7. if he exchanges rooks, he won't be able, i think, to both stop my pawns and make the c pawn a menace.  on the other side, the rook cannot leave the 8 row because of f7  and promotes, and if the rook goes elsewhere (say b8), i have again f7 , exchange rooks and then a winning endgame, or rg8 , kh8 and rg5 (say), and in order to stop my pawn from get to the 8�, he must use the knight: kb6. then f7, nd7, and i should win because black is almost in zugwang.  all this i foresaw (whew!), but... as planned. ...! back to thinking hard. however... again, kg6 would have won, because of similar themes than in the previous analysis.  ...he avoided the trap.  now, the bishop can go to d4, and black is "blocked" (this is not right, i realized later), even taking the c4 pawn. my king is free to give support to the pawns. ok, now he threats nc6, and i can answer ke4.  but, again, i had one of my "ideas".  with the idea: 38... e6xf5, 39 e5-e6, f7xe6, 40. rh8 , kf7. 41. rh7 , ke8. 42. rxr, kxr. 43. h4-h5, nc6. 44  bf6,  ke8 (if ne7 45. bxn, kxb, and by forcing the black king into h8 in order to capture the pawn, white wins, or maybe 45. kf4 first, ke8, 46. kg5 and white still wins). 45. kf4 and it goes more or less as before. but such analysis are very risky... it takes so much to be sure of them, that i tend not to consider other choices on the very first moves of them, as...   ...! now he sets the menace c7-c5... and i have to start again thinking! now, i was really tired (even for a correspondence game!). i just could think that i didn't want to "free" his king with f5xd6, and stay with two doubled pawns... the entire game was falling over me!  now: was the previous move a mistake? my bishop is in danger, as my a2 pawn...  who will win? was i lost or not? where was my mistake?  i have two threats: bishop g3, f4, h6, g7 and mate. but they are a lot of moves.  rg5 , then rg7, blocking his knight in order to defend f7. are they enough? 
-------------------------------------
as white, i've always preferred the closed and semi-closed openings. closed openings start with 1. d4 d5. semi-closed ones start with 1.d4 and black responds with some move other than 1. ... d5. the open game is 1.e4 e5, a semi-open game is 1.e4 where black makes moves other than 1...e5. flank openings 1.c4, 1.nf3, 1.f4 can easily transpose into closed or semi-closed (or sometimes open or semi-open). also, 1. d4 d5 can easily transpose into various openings such as the slav defense, chigorin defense, albin counter gambit, baltic defense, etc., if black later plays d5. and so we have a closed game. so we both bring our knights to c3 and c6. this is good. **************************************************************  generally, the knights belong on c3, c6, f3 and f6 on their 1st developing move. the primary reason for this is, each knight controls 2 of the 4 central squares: d4, d5, e4 and e5. i will speak more on controlling these crucial squares on white's move 7. ****************************************************************  the 2nd reason knights should be placed on these squares is that you don't know yet where they will be needed. let's say later in the game, you need your king's knight to help defend your queen side. the knight would get there faster from f6 than he would if you had played him to h6. if you wanted that knight to assist in an attack on my king, he would be on the job faster from f6, than from e7. the same principle applies to all 4 of those knight locations. ****************************************************************  the third reason is, a knight on f3 controls e1, d2, d4, e5, g5, g1 and h4; six squares. you usually want to place your pieces where they control as many squares as possible. a knight on e2 also controls 6 squares, c1, c3, d5, f5, g3 and g1. a knight on h3 controls g5, f4, f2 and g1; only 4 squares, thus an edge of the board knight is usually weaker than a knight in the center. a knight on f3 and e2 both control 6 squares, but the one on f3 is usually stronger due to the 1st two reasons above.  ***************************************************************  there are exceptions to every rule though. the squares c3, c6, f3 & f6 are the ultimate starting locations for knights, but depending on the position, d2, e2, d7 & e7 can be best, and on rare occasions, a3, a6, h3 & h6 are the best places to put a knight. when the latter is the case, it is usually just to relocate it to another place. ****************************************************************  key principle: develop towards the center! develop knights primarily to c3, c6, f3 & f6. so here we transpose into a qg (queens gambit), whether declined or accepted depends on you. in the qg, white offers black a "free" pawn in an attempt to draw black's d pawn away from controlling the center. if black accepts, white has many resources to use to get the pawn back, one of which is the simple qa4+, followed by qxc4. black cannot hold the pawn. ******************************************************************  it is generally accepted that it is safe to take the pawn as long as you don't try to hold on to it. on the other hand, i personally don't accept the qg pawn when i play black. to take would mean moving my pawn away from the center to take a pawn that i cannot hold. better to keep developing and supporting the center as you did with 3. ...c6, or with various other means. ******************************************************************  that is only a personal opinion, though, since many masters accept the pawn. if you choose to accept the pawn, that's fine. then you need to learn the various lines of play where black accepts the pawn. ******************************************************************  key principle: when and if you accept a pawn gambit, be careful about trying to hold the pawn. i'm not saying never try to hold a gambit pawn. sometimes depending on the position, you  should keep the pawn. i am only saying be careful.  ******************************************************************  in the case of playing black against the queens gambit, don't try to hold the pawn or don't accept it at all. qg declined / slav defense. with this move black threatens to accept the pawn, then support c4 with the pawn thrust to b5. i still was not concerned as black gives up the center control and i still have other resources to harass his queenside pawns, and potentially gain the pawn back, such as e3, followed by a4. if bxa4, then his pawn structure is terrible. i would then have no trouble winning the 2 pawns back! i continue to add pressure to d5, not concerned about 4. ...dxc4 and 5. ...b5 to protect the pawn on c4, because of the reasons stated on black's previous move. he who controls the center the best, controls the opening!  ******************************************************************  so we both are doing a good job of controlling the center. in the opening it is crucial to occupy and / or control the primary center squares, d4, e4, d5 and e5. secondarily, it is also important to do the same to the 12 squares surrounding those 4, being c3, c4, c5, c6, d3, d6, e3, e6, f3, f4, f5 and f6. lastly, it is good to control any squares on the board you deem important, based on the position. ******************************************************************  you have a pawn occupying d5, the c pawn controlling d5, a knight controlling d5 & e4, a bishop controlling e4 and the queen bearing down on d5. i have a pawn occupying d4, the c pawn controlling d5, the knights controlling the 4 primary squares and a queen honing in on d4. ******************************************************************   so thus far, we both have a lot of control of the center, but i have a little more than you do, since you have no occupation or control of d4 or e5. my extra control is not a major thing as of yet, but it is something you should be looking to work on. for example, you may want to consider nb8d7 and qc7 both to control e5. ******************************************************************   this type of analysis should be frequent throughout every game, especially in the opening! ******************************************************************   key principle: contend to control the center of the board! 5.qb3 to defend the d4 pawn, attack the undefended b7 pawn and apply more pressure to the d5 pawn.  be careful when bringing your queen out early, as she can be subject to attack, causing you to lose development. i will speak more on this on move 7 for black and white. i chose to bring my queen out early here because she can't be attacked easily on this square (exception being 6. ...dxc4 7.qxc4, or 6.qb6 as you  played, no problem). ******************************************************************  key principle: only bring your queen out early if she can't easily be chased around the board! so you offer me a queen trade, which would give you the disadvantage of doubled pawns and the advantage of an opened file for your queen side rook. ************************************************************** doubled pawns are a disadvantage because they are harder to work with later in the game, when you want to break through to get a passed pawn. isolated doubled pawns are worse, because they are also harder to work with to promote them, but more than that, they can`t defend each other. therefore they are easier for your opponent to attack and take them.  ***************************************************************  rooks need open files to reach their full potential. most frequently, files are opened in the middle (among other reasons, because the central pawns on the c, d, e & f files are the most frequently traded) and the rooks move there to gain their mobility. yet an open a-file would be ideal as the queen rook automatically is on an open file. *************************************************************** since the queen trade would not result in isolated doubled pawns, i felt your advantage of the opened file would be greater than your disadvantage of doubled pawns. i'd rather you took my queen, giving me the open rook file (and the doubled pawns). thus my next move, c5 to attack the queen. now you have to trade queens on my terms or move your queen off of the b file. this is the only reasonable square to move to (apart from trading queens) as you need to defend the b pawn. the move 6. ...qa6 would open you up to 7.e4 attacking the queen and the lsb. you probably saw that though since you did not play 6. ...qa6. :-) 7.bf4! so, i sacrifice my bishop, knowing that if you take him, i take your b pawn, then your rook! if you don't take my bishop, you have to move your queen, thus losing even more development. you already moved her twice. ******************************************************************  mohsen, let me make up an imaginary scene, then relate it to chess. imagine twins, jack and jake setting aside funds for retirement. jack set aside $10,000 in the year 2010 and invested it at a certain interest rate, say for example 9%. in the year 2050, his total interest earned would be $304,094.20. jake on the other hand waits until the year 2040, and sets aside $10,000 and invests it at the same interest rate, 9%. in the year 2050, his total interest earned would be only $13,673.60. ******************************************************************  what is interesting about this scenario, is that if all things are equal with the exception of the investment dates, jake can never ever catch up to his twin brother jack! you may ask, "why the lesson on investing? i'm here to play chess!" ******************************************************************  one of the most important principles in the opening is to try to get your pieces and pawns developed (moved out of the original square, to a more active location) as quickly as possible. if you don't, you may find yourself behind in development. it is also intriguing to know that if you play an opponent who knows how to take advantage of an initiative, similar to jake in the illustration, you're far less likely to be able to catch up! one way to get a lead in development is to force your opponent to move the same pieces over and over again. if you develop your queen, then i develop my bishop to attack her, forcing you to move her a 2nd time, i gain a "tempo", and you lose a tempo. one result of gaining tempo is that it gives you the initiative over your opponent. this means that you have a measure of control over how your opponent moves his pieces. you can't safely play qnd7 right now, for example. you'd lose your queen! ******************************************************************  both you and your opponent have things you'd each like to accomplish. every time your opponent forces you to make a move, he hinders you from doing what you may have planned, (unless of course if the move he forces you to make was actually part of your plan). if he forces you to make a move you did not want to make, it can put you in a position you don't want to be in! ******************************************************************  key principle: be careful mohsen, not to allow your opponent to gain tempo, and therefore development, faster than you do.   so now mohsen, you have moved your queen 3 times. take a look at your other pieces, compared to mine. ******************************************************************  you have a knight, bishop, 2 pawns and your queen developed. the only material you have intentionally placed are the knight, bishop and pawns. your queen was intentionally placed on b6, then she moved back to c7 and c8 where i chased her. it is good to force your opponents hand! as i said, if i force you to make a move you did not want to make, it can put you in a position you don't want to be in! ******************************************************************  i, on the other hand, have a bishop, 2 knights, 2 pawns and my queen not only developed, but sitting where i intended them to be. ******************************************************************  furthermore, i have 7 development moves, you only have 5! white goes first, so if all things remain equal, white makes 1 development move, then black makes 1 development move, white makes a 2nd development move, then black makes a 2nd development move, and so on. therefore black is always 1/2 development move behind. the battle in the opening is to tilt the scales in your favor (whether black or white). you want to force your opponent to lose development or tempo, by attacking more valuable pieces with less valuable material. ******************************************************************  a 2nd way to force initiative in development is to develop a piece with check. the king moves, (for example to d1 or d2 on the open d file), so you queen side castle, putting the king in check again. you have developed your bishop, your king to safety and brought your rook to an open file. all your opponent has done is move his king around. good for you!  preparing to continue my development.  preparing to continue your development. you need to try to catch up! now i have my queen and minor pieces off of the back rank. i only need to activate my rooks. you still have a queen, bishop, knight and both rooks undeveloped!   i normally prefer my bishops over knights. this is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped, closed positions, while bishops are stronger in open positions. so, you have to consider each game individually, but generally, as pieces get traded off, closed positions become open positions in the middle game and end game. as the position opens up, the bishops become stronger and stronger. so, although both pieces are technically the same value, the bishops are my piece of choice. that may be just a personal thing though, because while most strong chess players agree with me, i've met some who disagree. so here i attack your bishop and trade. then i will have 2 bishops against a knight in the endgame. ******************************************************************  also, the trade gives you doubled pawns, which can be compensated for by the fact that you also will have an opened file. earlier in the game, i stated that the opened file was more of an issue than the doubled pawns. in this case, i feel the opposite because, while you have an opened h file to attack my king, the dsb (dark square bishop) would help cover h2.  ******************************************************************  in addition, if you castle on the king side, your rook goes to f8 off of the open file. if you choose queen side castling, you have a good deal of maneuvering required, seeing how i attack your b pawn with my queen, and my dsb is on the h2-b8 diagonal. to queen side castle, you need to move your queen off the back rank. her only square to go to is d7, which should be reserved for the queen side knight.    now i will have 2 bishops against a knight and bishop. i rub my hands together. mohsen, it is usually best for pawns to capture toward the center of the board. it gets back to controlling those primary center squares, d4, e4, d5 and e5, and secondarily the 12 squares surrounding those 4, being c3, c4, c5, c6, d3, d6, e3, e6, f3, f4, f5 and f6. ******************************************************************  capturing as you did leaves the e6 pawn weak and less protected. you want to keep all of your pawns strong, but especially the pawns within these crucial areas. the e6 square is within that secondary range. ******************************************************************  this move also weakens your kings position as the a2-g8 diagonal is more vulnerable to be attacked. this (in conjunction with 15. ... e5) gave me space to make the combination: 18.nxd5 cxd5 19.qxd5+. qxd5 would not be check if you had captured via 11. ... hxg6. since it would not be check, the combination would not work, because when i play 19.qxd5, then you protect the bishop with 19. ... b6. ******************************************************************  key principle: make pawn captures toward the center of the board!   the stage is being set! you made a very natural move, castling king-side. yet, in the process, you put your king on the same diagonal as my queen. you are not yet in trouble, but the stage is being set! suspecting you may play nh5, i wanted to give my bishop a retreat square. if after nh5, i play bxn, i still give up a bishop for a knight. i wasn't interested.   i played this move not only to bring the rook to a more central square (since there are no open files to put the rook on), but i also did it in preparation for your 15. ...e5. i was not sure you would make that move, but just in case, i needed extra support on the c5 pawn, so after the exchanges on d5, i can play qxd5 followed by qxb or rxb (on c5).  aside from that, if there are no open files, it is good generally to bring rooks to one of the 4 center files (c, d, e or f). this is because the pawns on those files are the ones most likely to be traded.  14. ...nh5? be very careful about putting your knights on the side of the board. there are certainly exceptions, but generally, when you put a knight in this position, it should be to trade it off (as i did), or make a forking attack, or serious threat, or to get to another more active position.  ******************************************************************  in this example though, you may have done it with an intention to trade off my bishop, but i, not wanting to trade had an escape square. the knight has no attack or threat and there are no active squares he can move to, (with exception of f6, where the knight just came from. that wastes time and hurts your development). to make things worse, you helped me to shut your knight in further by trading on the e5 square (15... e5). this trading left me with a pawn on e5 cutting off your knights only escape route (f6). so the knight was forever stuck on the side until i attacked him (24.g4) and you resigned.   15... e5? after the exchange on the e5 square, i will have a pawn there, attacking f6. notice that f6 was the only square your knight had to retreat to. so 16.bxe5 nxe5 17.dxe5, and your knight is forever trapped. i knew the knight would never get back into the game, since you can't move your pawn on g7 as it is blocked by the pawn on g6. you can't move the pawn on g6 (to make space to move the pawn on g7) because i would play bxn. so the only way to make space for the knight would be to win the pawn on e5, before i play g4, but i have a enough to defend the pawn. you don't have enough fire power to win it. i delayed the g4 move since i felt the knight was dead anyway. he could neither attack me nor help defend you. ******************************************************************  also, this move 15... e5 removes protection from the pawn on d5, which helped me with a later combination, beginning with 18.nxd5. this capture enables you to get a bishop for a knight, which is good for you. but i went for it to get the pawn on e5, to block in your dead knight. there are also the other reasons pointed out in the annotation on 15...e5.   with this move, your knights fate is sealed. imprisoned forever! 17. ... bxc5? you've taken the poison pawn! this is bad for you because we have my queen and your king on the same diagonal. so after bxc5, i play 18.nxd5, with a discovered attack on your bishop! if you take back, (defending the bishop with your queen) i play qxp+. i give up my knight and win the 2 pawns, knowing i will the piece back when i take the bishop with my rook or queen. you could have played 17. ...kh8 to avoid the ensuing combination.   key principle: be very careful about allowing forking checks and discovered attacks.     i am considering now the following lines of play: 19. … kh8 20. rxc5 (gaining development as you move your king, then i attack your queen with my rook, to get even further development. seeking to gain development is not only an opening theme, it flows throughout the whole game!) or 19. … rf7 20. rxc5 qf8 21. bc4 re8 22. rc7 ree7 23. rxe7 qxe7 24. qxf7+ qxf7 25. bxf7+ kxf7 26. g4 or 19. qxd5+ rf7 20. rxc5 qf8 21. rc7 rd8 22. qb3 b5 23. rd1 rxd1+ 24. bxd1 a6 25. qxf7+ qxf7 26. rc8+ qf8 27. bb3+ kh8 28. rxf8# or 19. qxd5+ rf7 20. rxc5 qf8 21. rc7 rd8 22. qb3 b5 23. rd1 rxd1+ 24. bxd1 a6 25.	qxf7+ qxf7 26.	 rc8+ qe8 27. rxe8+ kf7 28.	ra8 ke6 29. g4! again, as i mentioned earlier, i take with the rook instead of the queen to force you to move her. taking with the queen in an attempt to trade queens would not be bad either. see my next note on 20. ...qd8 for the reason. you are behind in material,so it's not in your best interest to trade. i have 7 pawns to your 5, a 2 pawn lead. i have a strong bishop and you have a dead knight, so for all practical purposes, a bishop lead. yet in order to win the knight after g4, i have to give up a pawn (pxh5 and you play pxh5), reducing my pawn lead to 1.  so if we continue trading, then after everything is traded off, i will still have a pawn and bishop. i would use the king and bishop to help advance the pawn to become a  queen. key principle: avoid trades when you are behind in material! so we trade queens, and from this point on, i simply offer another trade, which you willfully accept, then i play g4 to attack the trapped horse.   again i am trying to trade off all equal material.   so the material on the board is dwindling down!   you resigned, seeing your horse was trapped in his stable. thanks for the game mohsen, i hope this was a lot of help! 
-------------------------------------
b3 is an unusual move from white. it is either to support c4 or prepare for a fiancetto. i follow the usual plan of the carokann and attack e4 with d5. after the exchange usual development occurs, white places a central pawn, but this blocks their bishop if they procede to place it at b2. nf6 strikes at the centre, defends d4 against the c4 threat, and helps prepare the kingside for castling.  in my opinion the fiancetto is wasted and accomplishes nothing with d4 blocked. i further build the pressure on e5. white offers an exchange, i accept. a key strategy behind the carokann is working towards a favourable endgame for black, so simplifying the board with the exchange suits my goals. the only option for white, doubled pawns would only consolidate their bishop's problem. nc6 is standard development. white enables queenside castling but the knight contributes little, it does attack e5 but does not help defend the king. nc3 is better, white could retreat their bishop to c8 and look for kingside play or look to move to a3 once it is safe. white castles their king, but black's position enables them to quickly mount an attack on the queenside. a3 is better and defends against nb4. black brings the queen in to play, this is a bit passive and is waiting for rc8, qa5 would have been more to the point. white develops to the kingside – but the threat is on the queenside, ne3 (with the aim of nc3) is better. bd6 does create a strong threat on the kingside, but again this was too passive, nb4 would have been better. g3 blocks my bishop, but the real threat is all queenside. black loses momentum with castling, there is a tenet of ensuring the king is safe before attacking – but there was no current threat to the black king! again nb4 would have been the best option. h4 is a blunder from white. h4 provides no benefit to white's position and the queenside threat needs to be addressed.. black finally starts the attack with nb4 which threatens the queen and qxc2#. another blunder, and the queen is lost with a fork from black's knight. the combination has won black the queen and a pawn to further weaken white's position. black queen's is in a perfect position to continue the attack.  ne1 is probably the best move for white, their knight becomes active and defends against the threat of rac8 followed by qxc2#. ba3 prevents the king from escaping and threatens qb2# after removing the knight on d3. white sees the threat and defends with their knight. black has plenty of options, if qb2# is prevented then rac8 followed by qxc2# is a solid plan to fall back on. a final blunder from white, rdc1 would have defend against this threat but at the cost of their rook ( rdc1 bxc1 19. rxc1).  white resigns. 
-------------------------------------
the was a strange game, with the advantage swinging from one side to the other, with neither side able to capitalise on our opportunities. in the end it came down to the old chess adage: “the winner of the game is the player who makes the next-to-last mistake” (savielly tartakover) the scotch game. i faced this opening several times against one of the top players in my chess club. my database shows that it is fairly even with all 3 outcomes (0-1, 1-0, 1/2) around 33% each, slightly in favour of white. a strange looking move but the 3rd most commonly played. attacking the e4 pawn, and will win the pawn after something like; 5. nc3 bb4 6. bd2 bxc3 7. bxc3 qxd4. however white will have good attacking chances in exchange for the pawn. this is an early mistake, giving me a free pawn early on. although the lead in development gives slight compensation. with an extra pawn i was happy to exchange queens, and remove any chance of quick counterplay. after this mass of action both sides will look to develop as quickly as possible. this move threatens to double the f-pawns, but can easily be met by ng4, however i thought i could see a better move... ...that turned out to be a complete blunder. over the next few moves my opponent takes a large lead in development and in position, that gives him good attacking chances a good move; if 10...bd6 then 11. bxf6 gxf6 leaves me with doubled isolated pawns, a positional nightmare.  once again i overlooked ng4, fearing the knight would struggle to make it's way back to my side. this was unfounded as ng4-e3-f5 is useable, although wastes a lot of time with the knight. this looks like a good aggressive move, however fails to take advantage of hte undefended c7 pawn, which cannot be easily defended (kd8 blocked off by the bishop) and so the best move would have been either nd5 or nb5. driving away the bishop, and so allowing the king to move to d8, and so removes the threat of nd5 completely.  a nice zwischenzug (inbetween move) before retreating the bishop white activates his rook to the open file with check. with my pinned knight and with 2 bishops and a rook lurking ominously i try to get my last piece out and look to castle to safety if given the chance. white wants to make the pawn thrust g4, so this is a prepatory move, however it is rather slow, and white could have played g4 straight away, as after 15. g4 bxg4 16. rhg1 h5 17. h3 bd2 18. rxg7, the position looks very much in whites favour. better would have been bd7, as bf5 allows white to play g4 with a tempo as it forces the bishop to retreat. bg6 would have been better, looking to move bf5-g6-f7 to try and remove one of whites aggressive pieces a stunningly bad move. it would have been better to play fxg5 and deal with the extra pressure from the bishop after bxg5. rf8 should cost a pawn after
-------------------------------------
so i start with my usual he knew that i would play the sämisch variation, and prepared a line which kasparov had played. i am not convinced that it is that good! this is a main line of the king's indian defence. for my comments on these moves, see this annotation of mine http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/penyfordd-v-rhyl-chester-district-league?gm=35684 or also see this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence,_s%c3%a4misch_variation black strikes at the white centre. white closes the position black attacks white's centre white develops black exchanges. i regard this as a mistake as it relieves pressure on the white centre. if white were ever to play 0-0-0 it would be hard for black to open up files against the white king. so i take back. i'm not sure this is best, why not nh5 and f5 immediately? so i develop the usual knight move i develop my queen he develops his knight after a long thought, i decide to castle queenside, which is what i often do in this sort of position. my thinking is this - if i castle kingside he has a ready-made attack with f5-f4, g5-g4-g3 etc. if he tries to attack my king on the queenside, he is going to find it hard to open uip the a or the b file. there are two plans i can follow - either move my king to b1, and try and take over the c file, or to launch an attack on the kingisde. however afterwards i found that castling kingside is more common in this position. what do you think dear reader, which side would you castle on? so his "attack" starts i tuck my king away. i am not afraid of 13...b4 14 na4 as he can't then make much progress on the queenside. threatening b4 now. i was surprised that this position is in the gameknot opening database. there are two games. both times white played a3 here. but i thought a3 would just help black open up lines on the queenside. i decided to give my knight the d1 square and played... also with a view to taking over the c file sometime. so he develops. i considered nxb5 here, but it is refuted by qxd2 16. bxd2 axb5 17. rc7 nc5, attacking bd3, so i played going for the king side attack a thematic pawn sacrifice. otherwise he just gets hammered on the kingside. so i take he takes back i take the pawn. he hits d3 and f3 so this is more-or-less forced again, i looked hard at nxb5 here. maybe going into an ending where i have 3 pawns for a knight was a good idea? my passed a and b pawns look good. any views dear reader. instead i continued with king side operations. and again i considered nxb5 - now that his ra8 has moved to c8 of course he can't meet it with a x b5 like he could before. what do you think dear reader? instead i continue my king side attack he hits my knight i retreat he takes. he explained afterwards he was wanting to take my queen away from protecting my bishop on e2. of course i can't recapture with my king as my pawn on a2 is hanging so i take with the queen and this is his combination. it isn't really sound, but i fail to find the best defence. i take, although taking on g6 or d6 are also options. he takes, hitting my bishop i hit the rook. what is this? a further sacrifice? i was thinking that he was planning  bxe4+ 26. ka1 bxh1 when 27. qc8+ bf8 28. bh6 mates him. i completely overlooked that he was also attacking a2. afterwards i was thinking that instead of taking the rook, i could have played 25. qc8+ bf8 26. bh6 immediately. however that fails to him playing qxa2+ followed by rc4+ winning my queen. but i did miss a win here. i should have played 25. b3 and white is clearly winning.

-------------------------------------
a wild game with edged to edged situations, very funny (at least for the players). thank you rednif_tap. to prevent 8. ... b5 standard developpement the lsb comes back in his place white has to take at this moment, i thought black was doing a mistake strong move but dangerous for black to protect e4 supressing the g knight's support bishop on the big diagonal, aiming at the opponent king. to support the e knight and the g pawn menacing mate by qg7 white cannot castle anylonger, is in late in developpement but has a strong menace on g7 and another by qxc8. preventing the mate so that white uses his other attack. at this point black misevaluated the situation and submited but both players agreed to reinstal the game and carry on. black had no other choice (if 20. ... kf7 21. qxb7+ kf8 and white wins the a rook by 22. qxa8 playing this move was strange because both players, at this moment, had access to the gk computer analyse which counselled 21. qc3 and after 10 moves, exchanging most of the pièces arrived at a position which, in my opinion led to a draw so that i decided to elect another line to gain another pawn in order to have a better endgame.  black has no other choice to save his rook 2 pawns advance for a better gameend. of course, the king situation is unsafe but i judged that i could defend it. attacking the unprotected bishop. keeping the bishop on the same diagonal, still unprotected but unattacked and aiming at the essential e1 square aiming at f2 the queen came to support her husband. ?? blunder, despite a long hesitation between 26. rg1 and 26. rh2, i choosed the bad solution. at this point, i tohought i could still save the situation but ... mate in 4 mate in 3 mate in 2. i submited here but i add the mate now. well done rednif_tap !  
-------------------------------------
ruy lopez opening preparing for the push d4. gaining control of the center. the attack on black's king begins with this pawn thrust. i think ne7 or qc8 would have been better here.  the computer sees nothing wrong with this move, though it gives white a slight advantage. the computer doesn't like this one.  it suggests: best: +1.96 » … gxf6 12.  bf4  o-o  13. qd5+ kh8  14. rad1 be8  15. h3 qxd5  16. nxd5 nge5  17. nxe5 nxe5  18. nxb6 bxb5  19. nxa8 bxf1  20. nxc7.  the suggested line leaves white up a pawn. once again, i believe ne7 would have been a better counter.  the computer disagrees. best: +2.89 » … kf8 13.  nd5  h6  14. bh4 bg4  15. nxf6 qxd1  16. rexd1 gxf6  17. bxc6 bxc6  18. bxf6 bxf3  19. bxh8 bxd1  20. rxd1 if anybody can tell me why 13...ne7 is bad, please, i need the help. even though this move sets up a deadly attack by white, i understand why black played this move.  it seems that there is no immediate threats that white can make against black's king.  it took me a while to find my 15th move. computer suggests: best: +6.08 » … kf8 14.  nd5  be8  15. nxf6 qxd1  16. raxd1 bf7  17. nd7+ kg8  18. nxb6 axb6  19. bxf7+ kxf7  20. rd7+ kg6  21. rxc7 rxa2 now, no matter blacks move, white wins at least a piece. and this move allows the forced mate.  i would have suggested 15...be6 for black.  after 16 nf4+ kf7 17. bxe6+ kf8, black seems to have a respite from the attack.  computer disagrees again: best: +12.61 » … bxf2+ 15.  kxf2  ng4+  16. kg3 qxg5  17. nxg5 nge5  18. nf3 nxf3  19. qxf3 rhe8  20. bd3+ kh6  21. qf4+ g5  22. qxc7 though this leaves black down a queen. black can only delay the inevitable.  1-0. 
-------------------------------------
hi everyone!  it looked as though i was going to lose the endgame hands down, but would a removal of the guard tactic change the result?  do read on. 1. ….. c5 - an unusual move by yours truly - usually i play into the qga and get mixed results. 2. …… f5 - curiouser and curiouser. 5...… qa4+ - now i bring glenda out fairly early doors.  however, it does result in white moving his knight twice to block the check. 6. …… bg7 - out of this craziness a normal developing move at last! 7. …… nf6 followed by another! 9. …. 0-0 - the sanity remains with me putting henry safely on the kingside. 12. …… gxf5 - had to weaken my castled position.  hopefully i will not pay for shattered kingside pawns. 13. ….. rf7 - prevents fork on e6. 15. ….. nc7 - almost my last piece leaves my first rank and this prevents a knight invasion on e6. 17. …… ng4 - trying to ward off any frontal attacks to my king's position. 18. ….. bd4 - attack! 21. nb5! - this move floored me!  my knight on c7 is en prise and if i take the b5 knight along comes that dreaded fork.  if i move glenda to defend the knight then i will still fall for the fork!  i find a combo though that seems to be the least of all the evils! 24. ….. nd4 - after a crazy passage of play we have a knight fork! 26. ….. qf7 - after the dust has settled i find myself a pawn to the bad. 29. …… bxa3 - fou lenoir at least prevents white's outside pawns from being passers through capture.  unfortunately i will go back to being a pawn down in the next few moves. 32. …… a5 - i now push up my own passer. 33. ….. bb4 - there is no saving the pawn on e7 so fou lenoir gets out of the line of my passer and defends it and attacks the wq at the same time.  alas, it does not prevent the e7 pawn from falling but at least he has to capture it with his queen first. 34.... qg6 with the idea of bailing out with a perpetual check on b1. 38. ….. kf8 - the wb is en prise but my position looks still lost now being 2 pawns to the bad. 39. f4?? - this move proves to be a gross error which will turn the game immediately in my favour.  he should have played bb2 or ba1. 39. …. rxe5! - this turns out to be the removal of the guard.  no matter what black does i will be a piece up on the next turn.  if he saves his rook i save mine, if he takes my rook, henry will take his.  what a turnaround! 41. e6 - so he advances his passers but no worries, henry will put a stop to that nonsense by playing kf6 on the next turn. 42. g4 - a valiant attempt at counterplay but i have worked out that my a pawn will get to glendadom before anything gets to it! 42. ….. a4 - so, my little christian soldier, onward to glendadom you go! 43. …..ke7 - i do not take the poison pawn on g5.  i work out that he will bring down his h pawn but this will be way, way too late. 44. h4 - nacht! 44. ….. a3 - double nacht! 45. …… a2 - this is just ace - only one square to go for that footman that was in so much danger some moves ago.  best of all glenda when she appears has complete control of the a1-h8 diagonal and if white leaves his king where it is then glenda can also land in a handy check. 46. ….. a1/q+ cheeck! now because white must move his king i can now start a clean up operation.  i now exchange my h7 pawn for white's g6 pawn. 48. ….. qg7 - glenda will remove white's g6 pawn on the next turn and then mop up all the other white pawns before turning to the bog standard k+q v bare king wrap up.  white finally accepts this awful reality and waves the white flag.  wheew and double wheew! 
-------------------------------------
hi all; annotating this very interesting game on request! white opens with the old standard. sicilian. the theory behind this opening is notoriously deep; i'm not going to go into it very much. this is the canal–sokolsky attack, also called the moscow variation.  3...nc6 and 3...bd7 are more common, but there's nothing wrong with this move. good, solid, thematic move. black invites some very sharp play. forced. ?! this is the first deviation from book lines as far as i know. while there's nothing obviously wrong with this move--it doesn't lose material or anything--the knight is badly misplaced on g4, and can be driven away at white's leisure with a gain of tempo, with moves like 7.ng5, setting up 8.e6. best was 6...ne4, building pressure on the nc3 (which was the whole reason for playing 5...qa5+). probably 7.ng5 was stronger but this is fine. ?? this error is as subtle as it is deadly. by blocking b6, black has cut off his queen's retreat path, and now there's suddenly no way at all to save her! 8.nd2 (also threatening the undefended ng4) followed by 9.nb3 wins the bq outright, with no chance of escape! she could try to run to b4, but then 11.a3 keeps her trapped, and she'll have to move again to gain more than a pawn for her life. the line i gave above was better, but this is still fine, blowing open the bk's cover. look how much better white's position feels, even though material is basically even: the bq is useless and on the verge of being trapped for good, and none of black's minor pieces are doing anything useful either. white's minor pieces, on the other hand, are all actively placed and contributing to the threats on the board. 8...e6 was better. now white has the chance to break through the center with the advanced pawn and nd5 after playing 9.bc6 to get the bishop out of danger (with tempo!) ? simply put, it's hard to see a reason for this move. white still has a much better position, but this pawn push does nothing to advance his goals. much better was 10.nd5, threatening nc7+, adding pressure to e7, as well as threatening to trap the bq with 11.bd2. ? that pawn was a thorn, to be sure, but opening up the king like this is an invitation for disaster. now white's 11.nd5 comes with even more potent threats, as the king no longer has any defenders (and re1 is on the way, as well as the other threats i already mentioned). black needed to play 10...cxd4 instead, to let his queen out of her miserable little corner. another pawn move with no purpose: what does this accomplish for white? it forces black to put his knight in a better position--hardly what white wanted to do here! 11.nd5 was certainly best, threatening all manner of checks and threats (nc7+, re1+, bd2...). ! black finds the correct intermezzo here, gaining time to free his queen and allowing his knight to relocate to the strong e5 post. ? black wants to castle, and rightly so, but this doesn't get it done, because white still has too many threats. better was 13...qc5, where the threat of entrapment is gone and the queen can finally be of some use tying down the white pieces to defending one another. correct! all the old threats are still viable; black is in trouble. again, material is *even*, but there's no question that white is in vastly better shape. ? this should have come earlier, say around move 10, or else later. counterplay is the right thought, but this is the wrong way to do it just now, as it simply loses a piece outright to a nice tactical shot... ! if now 15...kxe7? 16.bxb7! black cannot recapture, because 16...rxb7?? 17.nc6+ wins the bq. black must simply run away with his tail between his legs. or take, as i mentioned above, but since he can't avoid losing material, he should not be making more exchanges. the general case of the rule is simple: when behind, don't exchange!! better was probably 15...kf8 or maybe 15...f6, seeking to get the king out of the center any way possible. ? but white misses his own combination! as i mentioned above, this was a good threat several moves ago, but now that black's c-pawn is gone, the queen can't be trapped this way. best was to pick up the free bishop with 16.bxb7. ?? white is trying to put pressure on the ne5, but overlooks his hanging bc6. his mobility should have allowed him to continue with several powerful threats (indeed 17.nf5+ kd8 18.bxb7 rxb7 19.be3 qmoves 20.nxd6 wins a pawn and an exchange with no counterplay for black), but getting too tricky has led him to drop a piece instead. ? now it is white's turn to make trades at the wrong time: he is down a full piece at this point; he shouldn't be making exchanges. perhaps 19.bg3, threatening 20.f4, would have been better. trying to stop the bleeding and allow the queen to get into play. ! black keeps up the pressure, offering exchange after exchange. when material is uneven (especially by a full minor piece), exchanges almost always benefit the player who has more. 21...b4 was stronger, taking advantage of the queenside minority to force trades. the text hangs the e-pawn and gives white back the initiative. i don't much like this; that pawn isn't really going anywhere if black doesn't want it to. the computer prefers 23.qg4 or 23.qh5, and so do i. when behind, counterplay has to become the name of the game! this just invites white to put his rc1 on e1 where it belongs. i like 24...rhe8 better, in preparation for ...kf8 to get out of the pin. ?? white misses the threat, and the rest is history. ?? 27.qh3 was called for (though 27.resigns was playable). now black has his own chance to trap a queen, but unlike white, he jumps on it immediately. 0-1. faced with ruinous material loss, white resigns. not a perfect game by any means, but certainly interesting to see all the tactical opportunities that sprang up as early as move 6! well played by both sides, and well worth a close look at all the middlegame maneuvering. we saw both sides make poor choices that would have been strong at another time: a good reminder that every single chess position is different. what was strong last move may be fatal now! thanks for reading! 
-------------------------------------
una patta incredibile, difficile da vedere... non serve 4.e5 per d6xe5, 5.dxe5, dxd, 6.rxd, e il cavallo salta tranquillamente. rimane la perdita dell'arrocco in cambio di un buon pedone in e5. comunque, l'apertura non � stata ben giocata, e le nere si trovano gi� impacciate e scomode. beh, adesso, se l'alfiere ritorna, non avrebbe avuto molto senso portarlo in g5. mossa, peraltro, discutibile. quindi, ho fatto i calcoli e... gi�. qui temevo l'arrocco, ma ho dovuto farlo. l'alternativa era tg8 e poi cercare di arroccare sul fianco dama.  secondo me, con g2-g4 le bianche vincevano, per� riconosco che non era ben chiaro come. quindi ho rischiato.  non ricordo bene i calcoli, ma non pu� essere una buona mossa. comunque, una ragione c'era ;-((( probabilmente ho voluto lasciare la colonna g a disposizione della torre, e parare un eventuale sacrificio di cavallo in h6. se qua ritiro l'alfiere, le cose prendono una brutta piega con axf6 e poi f4... per questo ho mosso il re, in casi del genere avrei sempre potuto sfruttare la colonna g con la torre. magra consolazione. anche direttamente 16. g5: dopo lo scambio, il re rimaneva scoperto. 
-------------------------------------
 allora ho avuto una delle mie famose idee. in questo modo bloccavo un po' il fianco di re, comunque mi garantivo lo scambio di un mio cavallo per un suo alfiere. comunque, una posizione bruttissima e praticamente perduta.  quando si gioca in difesa, a volte bisogna essere molto "zen": assorbire e smorzare, senza molte pretese.  segue secondo me un errore. con f4, le bianche mi distruggevano. certo che avevo cxg5, ma...  sembra un errore, ma se arginavo f4 con il il pedone, rinunciavo proprio a tutto e il mio alfiere bianco rimaneva incastrato malamente.  questa non l'ho proprio capita. ho calcolato che la posizione era difendible dopo questo scambio. adesso per le bianche l'attacco � meno devastante (?).  la minaccia era txc, e se rxt, e4-e5  prendendo l'alfiere. ho voluto tenerlo qui, per scambiarlo con quello bianco in caso di e4-e5. qui si vede la simpatia della torre in d7. di nuovo, mozza "zen".  s�, condanno il cavallo, ma tutto il resto � ben protetto, e il mio alfiere � libero.  questo � un errore, perch� dopo il salto di cavallo in d4 c6 non � pi� difeso. dovevo impedire che il cavallo bianco arrivasse a d5 o e6, senn� erano guai.  per� avevo sbagliato a fare i conti. qui, il cavallo bianco � altrettanto pericoloso che in d5, o almeno cos� ho creduto. in realt�, riguardando, forse potevo tenere duro anche di fronte a cd5. ma mi sono spaventato, e ho usato l'alfiere per proteggere d5. senza vedere che perdevo un pedone importantissimo.   con questa, teoricamente proteggevo b5, perch� poi con ac4 vincevo la qualit�.  la probabile soluzione era ac4, e dopo la mossa di torre, tf8.  ma mi sono "perso".  adesso, per�, l'attacco bianco � fermo, e io posso ripigliarmi.  cd5 non � pi� molto pericolosa. non era sufficiente cf3  per riprendere la torre. se prendevo la torre in e1, poi guadagnavo c2, ma la sua torre in e6 mi � sembrata pericolosa, insieme al cavallo. forse era migliore. comunque... ahhh... adesso sono io ad avere un lieve vantaggio posizionale!  e con questo errore, recupero il pedone! del resto, con td1, cf3 , poi cd4... guarda guarda, adesso ho un pedone in pi�. il pedone in h delle bianche dovrebbe scomparire presto, e con due pedoni centrali uniti, uno passato, dovrei addirittura vincere. pensavo che d5 fosse sufficiente, invece... questa � la posizione "bella": patta!  d5 � minacciato.  se faccio th4  e poi prendo h5, lui prende d5. continuo ad avere due pedoni liberi, ma la mia torre � scomoda. e anche lui ha un pedone libero, e quando questo avanza, ho le mie belle difficolt� a fermarlo (anche il cavallo � inchiodato).   se avanzo a d4, ce8 . attenzione a dove va il re, per evitare un altro scacco con gli occhiali, e perdo la torre. potrebbe essere perpetuo, a meno che vada per esempio in f8. allora, cf6, minacciando la torre e difendendo h5! adesso lo scacco non mi serve pi�. se la torre va in f5, cd7  e perdo il pedone in e!  non sono solo quelle, le minacce. una volta rotti i pedoni centrali, le nere devono difendere quello in d, che comunque non pu� avanzare. rimane solo il pedone h, se il nero riesce a prenderlo senza perdere anche d!  che il "gentile lettore" mi dica: possono vincere le nere?  ora, altra cosa � che le bianche abbiano giocato male... sbaglio.  non serve a niente dare scacco con la torre per prendere in h, perch� poi entra la torre bianca nella colonna f, e qualche pedone salta. 
-------------------------------------
 se sono le bianche a dare lo scacco in f2, il re va in e7.  se tf2 , il re va a prendere il pedone in h, e adesso s� che "funziona".  ...no, non funziona per cf6, of course. ah, i cavalli sono i pezzi pi� "magici" degli scacchi. insidiosissimi. ma questo vale anche per io mio. per me � meglio scambiare i cavalli che le torri. se cxc, e5xf4 , rf3, te3 , rf2 (se rg2, f3  e poi posso difendere anche con il re il pedone), ta3. non posso prendere il pedone direttamente con il re! rxh5, rf3! non ci si pu� proprio rilassare! e neanche qui posso prendere direttamente h5, perch� di nuovo, rf3 e o � patta o perdo il pedone. per�, ho fatto i compiti e ho visto che ho una possibilit�. se riesco a scambiare le torri sulla colonna e quando mi prende il pedone, vinco perch� il suo re rimane tagliato fuori dalla colonna h. vediamo se funziona.  
-------------------------------------
as i know very little about the reti opening, i'll choose my next moves in the  database. at this point, i wonder if the b knight has to come on d7 or c6 i finally opt for 4. ... nd7 sir perceval is going to protect his fellow lancelot. the white knight is challenging perceval. no real choice. perceval must accept all challenges black has no way to fire the bishop immediately. so that dame guenièvre can protect her faithfull lancelot. black has now 4 pieces out against 3 for white.  the bishop has little places to go. carrying on pinning the white lady. developping i want to get rid of the anoying ecclesiastic i'm not sure it's a very good move : the bishop is unprotected. black's plan is to take full control of the center. the soldiers advance so that white's dsb is blocked on both diagonals.  if 13. dxe4 nxe4 and the white knight is under menace of dame guenièvre. if she can come to f6, there is a mating menace by a further qxf2 white sees the trap and sends his brave knight in the middle of the ennemies... paradoxically, the safest place. preventing 14. nxg7 so that the knight kills the poor d4 soldier... ... and is pinned to the rook d4 has lost his protection if 16. exd3 bxd1 enabling exd3 only place white is ahead again in material but has a weak king. preparing bxd4 it doesn't prevent bxd4 but provides an escape to the king. trading no real  choice dame guenièvre charges in the middle of the battle preparing to castle white has only one move available if he wants to castle if 21. bd2 qxd3 aiming at the queen. material equality, the white king is unsafe, black controls the open and semi open files, and indirectly the center (all his pieces are aiming at it). black's pawn structure is better (white has an isolated pawn) and black pieces are better connected. black's plan is to fully destroy white's e and d pieces to cut white army in two. of course. protecting c7 and preparing an attack on the dsb. i overlooked this move. but it doesn't change black's plan ptotecting the c rook and the dsb lancelot charges furiously under the eyes of his true love... ... and dies heroïcally dame guenièvre is sad but doesn't attack foolhardy. to join queen and rook. black's plan has not change : eliminate the central white pieces. menacing the black queen... aiming at the e pawn. at least, this move doens't surprise me (many previous moves by white were unforeseen). white can take the c pawn but black has now mating menaces. i'm not sure it's a good move, black will have a very strong attack. 29. rc2 might have been better. at this point, i hoped it was the final attack. "mission completed, my king" countering, but white cannot get further i do not think white can avoid the mate, except by trading his queen against a rook. pinning the rook but black doesn't need to move it - mate in 5  white submits here. i add the mate.  
-------------------------------------
so i started with my usual. i should perhaps add that i am annotating the game on the morning after. i am pretty sure of all the moves, but i may have got them in the wrong order! wine was served with the lunch, which may explain the poor quality of this game! we were also moving quite fast - just like we used to have a quick game after lunch when we were students together! he replies in kind. i go into the queen's gambit. he replies with the albin's counter gambit! he always played this as a child, but it had slipped my mind. so i take. he advances. the careless move 4.e3? can lead to the lasker trap. after 4...bb4+ 5.bd2 dxe3 6.bxb4?? is a blunder—6...exf2+ 7.ke2 fxg1=n+! and black wins. the lasker trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion in practical play. so i played this. this is unusual. black normally plays c5 or nc6. michael aims for c5, but he wants to exchange black square bishops first, rather than be left with a bishop on f8 restricted by the pawn on c5. i figure that exchanges help me as i am a pawn up. he takes. i develop my knight. he continues with his plan. development of the bf1 to g2 is very common in this opening. michael develops. so do i. black turns it into a proper gambit, rather than try to regain the pawn. so i take. he takes back. i castle. so does he. i have a plan to get rid of his powerful pawn on d5. he develops. i continue with my plan. he takes. i rather expected d4-d3. i take back. i think i am a clear pawn up now. he develops his queen, planning to bring his rook a8 into play. i plan to bring a knight to e4, to exchange pieces. he hits my queen. this is probably a mistake, by bishop is probably better than his knight. now he originally recaptured with his pawn, saying he had to take that way. i asked why. he replied that that i could just take his bishop with my rook on g5. i pointed out that although it was a rook with a piece of paper round it, it was in fact a knight! i allowed his to take back the pawn capture and take with the queen instead. white now has very weak squares round the king, but i don't think black can exploit it. i move my queen which was attacked. he completes his development. i continue with my plan. he takes. i take back, but this is a massive mistake, losing all my advantage. because after this move black wins the exchange, rook for bishop. although white has a pawn for it, it is not enough. michael very sportingly offered a draw here, which of course i accepted. it was time for us to go on a coach tour of chester. this was followed by dinner at night, and the conclusion to a lovely reunion day! many thanks for reading this, please rate it on the star system, and leave a comment or two!

klassiska king's gambitdraget, och jag ät ställd direkt. det vanligaste svaret, med 36-39 till svart. vanligaste svaret, med 36-40 till svart. näst vanligaste svaret, där 3...g5 är vanligast. 3...d6 markerar fischer defence, med 39-43 till svart. vanligaste svaret med 41-41 lika. draget finns inte i proffsboken, men är tredje vanligaste drag i amatörboken. 4...g5 är huvudteorin, med 41-49 till svart. 4...bg4 ger 66-25 till vit. näst vanligaste draget med 50-32 till vit. huvuddraget är 5. bxf4 i amatörboken med 69-23 till vit. 5:e vanligaste draget med 53-30 till vit. +1,15. bättre är 5...g5 med +0,33 det påbjudna svaret med +1,01 alldeles för sent för att bromsa vits framfart +1,78. bättre är 6...nc6 med +1,03. det näst bästa svaret +1,18, där 7. qb3 är 1:a drag med +1,75. +1,10 här hade 8. c3 varit vits bästa drag med +1,26, medan 8. qh5 ger -0,38. vits avsikt är uppenbar och jag övervägde först qe7,men valde att parera med det sämre nh6. +2,88 och jag inser att 8...qe7 hade varit en bättre parering. +2,89 och jag korrigerar spontant misstaget med nh6, men förbiser taktiska möjligheter med nxd4 för att sedan gaffla på c2. +3,14 och det känns som att vit har definitivt grepp om partit. +3,12 +3,14 och jag greppar efter halmstrån. +3,22 +3,23 och jag väntar mig idel attacker från vit. +3,35 och vit täcker upp svaga punkter först. +3,73 och jag försöker hitta taktiska öppningar. +3,50 +3,52 och qd3+ är en långsiktigare schackning än den på g2. min bonde på f4 parerar g3 snyggt. +0,88 och jag återfår lite initiativkraft igen. lite för bråttom, och jag hade vunnit på att utveckla tornet till e8 med kommando över e-filen. alternativt sacka med nxd4 och sedan återfå initiativet med qxd4 +. nu står +3,93 +2,90 -0,45 och jag återtar initiativet. -0,14 och än finns det hopp om att vända på kuttingen. bättre hade pinnen med qf2 varit , och varit mer tvingande för vit. nu står det +3,89 vits bonde på h6 står alldeleles för nära, men jag är för inriktad på att lösa upp min låsta position i det här läget. +-0.00 och jag är åter med i matchen. -7,54 och vit tappar mark. endast schackningar återger mig initiativet, så jag finner schackpunkterna. -8,55 och vit är trängd. nu ryker vits l på d5. -9,41 och diagonalen mot g2 är skyddad, om inte vit parerar. -16,19 vit parerar, men mina övriga alternativ är stora. vits l på f4 står oskyddad. men jag missar den taktiska gaffeln med nxd4, som öppnar upp vägarna till matt. -7,55 fortfarande står min s och väntar på nxd4, men jag är ovan att tänka så taktiskt och intrikat i sådana här lägen. vits bonde på h6 är skyddad av hans t, och i normala fall bör man tänka igenom en sådan här position noga. för ytligt tänkande, och jag ger bort mitt övertag alldeles gratis. såklart mitt bästa alternativ. nu blir det fart på matchen. +0,24 och jag kom undan med blotta förskräckelsen. -2,49 och nu inser jag äntligen att min s kan behövas däruppe på vits planhalva. hotar med en riktig praktgaffel på f3. -4,35 vit bromsar gaffeln mellandrag vit hänger sin s -5,08 och jag känner vind i seglen. -9,39 och nu täcker jag gaffelpunkten på f3. en smarrig kungsgaffel och snart tar vi kärringen. där åkte hon till blåkulla ;-) och vit ger upp. 
-------------------------------------
searching for a semi indian defense, black goes for all looking for a change but i decide pressure to king because it has no space a paun near king and queen in 10 moves it´s always an excting position bishop appears lonely, almost forgotten from the beggining discipline, no one strikes, quiet play black bishop feels the hit ando goes for a cooling change who needs towers!!?? black closed position, king´s paun feels bad, swets. white is not attacking awaeful mistake and punished clearly advantage for black. note that lonely bishop has not move, never since he get there black attacks with their supperiority, but kings has no defense white can´t find a hole and liberates king, the persecution begins. lonely bishop stills king totally blasted, has not air only chance, replegated the queen ,this position requires knight for the blacks, but ja! tower comes to help. if king escape loses his queen, if queen sacrifice, black crowns and it over, so??? revenge of a forgotten bishop, more than 20 moves still, but he was there! chek.  if queen takes, tower dies, queen to queen is going for tie, no one likes ties so move king, imagination is required for the queen living a dead position for white king queen managed to take kings seeing each other, this is it, bad move loses revenge bishop sacrifices and gets even giving an amazing check, black queen caught it is over queen takes and then is just joy! breeth paun crowns and two queens blasted the black king 
-------------------------------------
this was steve's great come-back match - his first in the evening leagues for about 3 years - against his old club! steve's comments are in inverted commas. the dunst opening is a chess opening where white opens with the move: 1. nc3.  this fairly uncommon opening may have more names than any other: it is also called the heinrichsen opening, baltic opening, van geet's opening, sleipnir opening, kotrč's opening, meštrović opening, romanian opening, queen's knight attack, queen's knight opening, millard's opening, knight on the left, and (in german) der linksspringer. "i spent four minutes on my reply to move 1 as i had prepared this line played in the game roughly to move 8 or so against john years ago and was trying to remember it!" this is the same position as 1.e4 d5 2.nc3, an obscure branch of the scandinavian defense.  the move 2...d4 gives black a spatial advantage, which white may work to undermine along the lines of hypermodernism. keilhack writes, "2...d4 is chosen either by somewhat naive players who are attracted by the fact that black wins time and space ... or by strong players who are aware of the strategic risks but are striving for a complex battle." (keilhack 2005:44) he considers the van geet attack, 2...d4 3.nce2 followed by ng3, to be "the core of the 1.nc3 opening,". but black stops that for the time being. preventing black from playing d4-d3 black simply develops. white attacks the bishop. so bishop retreats. white develops a bishop. black puts the question to the bishop. and the bishop runs back - i think i would have exchanged rather than lose the tempo. black takes the centre. i prefer black already. white tries to undermine the black centre. so white re-enforces it. white attacks b7. black protects. white attacks the bishop. so it drops back. the other knight comes out. and black develops his. and white's last minor piece comes out. queens come off. white takes back. black develops his bf8. attacking the bishop. black castles. instead of exchanging the white knight takes up a commanding position, attacking, amongst other things, the bishop on d6. so the bishop drops back. white finally castles. the rook is moved to the logical square. presumably planning on breaking open the c file. perhaps played to one day advance the king via g6? steve says "john could and probably should have won a pawn by playing cxd exd and then nxd as i cannot recapture due to losing my bishop but i do have the john could and probably should have won a pawn by playing cxd exd and then nxd as i cannot recapture due to losing my bishop but i do have the intermezzo bxng3. this is not john's style....it's mine!!! so he bottled out and went solid without much play.. this is not john's style....it's mine!!! so he bottled out and went solid without much play." to me the intermezzo bxng3 seems to win a piece for the pawn and refutes 19. nxd4. however is does seem strange to block the c file immediately after moving the rook to the c file. fritz likes this move and now gives black a slight edge. white doubles on the a file, but a5 is easily protected. black is gaining space on the king side as well as the queen side. white blocks that. preparing for action on either side of the board. carrying on with his plan. but it is easily met. white appears to be just shuffling his rooks around without any strategic plan. presumably with the plan of nb8-c6-b4. white at last does the pawn break. black completes the re-positioning of his knight. white takes. black takes back. this seems like a strategic error by white to exchange off his good bishop in exchange of black's bad bishop. so black takes. white takes back. steve says "i was happy now as i felt that i have all the chances to win as long as i am careful". this rook starts returning to a more useful square. another exchange. steve says "maybe knight is a fair bit stronger...not pawn takes though due to potential tactical shots!" pawn takes of course loses white two minor pieces for a rook. it doesn't make much difference whether white recpatures with rook or knight as black is playing g6 next move whatever, driving the piece back. like this. and the rook drops back. king repositions to counter any threats white may develop along the semi open f file. the other rook comes across. steve says "much better than nb4 i thought." yes it is, the knight takes up a dominating post in the centre of the board. "draw offered by john....no thanks we need to get the win to help the team!" steve was quite right to turn down the draw. in a four board match we went two down, but managed to draw it with wins on this and the other top board. but even without that to consider, fritz gives this position as about plus 1 for black. clearly white's bishop is virtually useless, hemmed in by its own pawns, unable to defend on dark squares. in these blocked positions knights are far better than bishops. "now john can't break through at all easily as f7 is protected." "....shuffling about..." "the winning try now i have all the squares!" fritz agrees that this is the best move. white takes. black takes back, threatening to go to e3. so the white knight has to drop back to stop this. ".....threatening nf2 if he doesn't exchange......" "ooops!" black corrrectly takes the chance to win the exchange. white has to take otherwise rd1 goes. black takes back. "....and now the fat lady starts to warble......." a hopeless gesture. black simply takes. black saves the b pawn, at least for the time being, but the position is resignable - white is exchange and pawn down and black dominates the second rank, all white's pieces are passive. once the other rooks enters it is curtains. white attacks the rook. rook attacks b3. white protects. but now white can't avoid the loss of at least another pawn, and so gives up. in my view a most impressive come-back game! thank you for reading, please rate the annotation on the star system, and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am getting on. until next time dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
i was pleased with my play in this game. the fun starts when i sacrifice a knight for two pawns. i gain a third pawn then sacrifice the exchange and then a pawn to keep his king on the run! the match was played on board 1 of division 3 of the chester & district league. in our previous encounter he had beaten me with white - my only loss this season in this division - so i am doubly pleased to win! rhyl & prestatyn 2 won the previous encounter 3-1 and we won this encounter 3-1. division 3 tuesday 10th march 2020 rhyl & prestatyn 2	vs	malpas & oswestry 2 1	mohammed ayad (125)	0	-	1	charles lowick higgie (171) 2	chris grier (130)	1	-	0	peter lovatt (145) 3	andrew hughes (123)	0	-	1	tim mcmahon (135) 4	diego garcia lucas (99)	0	-	1	david thomas (105) final score:	1	-	3 so i am wondering, king's indian or grunfeld? so let's see! king's indian it is! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence i take the centre. the usual move i play the sämisch variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_indian_defence,_s%c3%a4misch_variation arguably already an inaccuracy, and possibly better (and certainly more common) is 0-0. as played he never castles. i develop. again, 0-0 is better. this is very passive, and on b6 the b pawn blocks the d8-a5 diagonal in some variations. 6....b6 has been seen before though. i carry on with my development. he puts a pawn in the centre. i protect d4 he said after the game he wanted to stop my bishop going to g5, but this is another inaccuracy. better is 0-0 although white has an edge in this position. now he can't castle without losing his h6 pawn. he takes. i take back. he develops. played after a lot of thought. fritz is preferring b3 with virtual equality. fritz prefers rc8 with a slight edge to black. fritz prefer ndb5 with equality. fritz agrees with this move. and with this one! and with this. and with this. fritz prefers ne-d7 with a slight edge to white. here i was thinking that the game would continue with nxd5 16.	cxd5	nxd4 17.	bxd4	bxd4 18.	bb5+	kf8 19.	qxd4	 with a slight edge to white. fritz here like ndb5 this is a move that fritz considers but eventually preferring nxd5 fritz likes this move. fritz likes this move. ok what would you play here as white? would you play this? i analysed the three ways that black could take. 17.	nxe7	nxe7 18.	nxd6+	kf8 19.	bxc5 and then nxb7 recovers the sacrificed piece with massive advantage. 17.	nxe7	qxe7 18.	nxd6+	kf8 19.	nxc8	bxc8 gives white a slight material advantage - two knights sacrificed for rook and pawn.  fritz doesn't play 17. nxe7 but i think it is clearly best. but there is this way of taking back. fritz does think this is best, although gives this position as equal. fritz likes this move. fritz likes this move. fritz likes this move. i can't play 19. qd5 immediately as black has the defence 19....ne5 i played 19. bxc5 with a certain degree of reluctance and some thought - i didn't want to give up my lovely dark squared bishop - clearly my good bishop - but it is the best move. he takes back. forking pawns on f7 and c5. fritz likes this move. i had "seen" this position in my head when i sacrificed on e7 on move 17 and concluded that getting a third pawn for the piece would be at least good enough. fritz like this move. and this one. that move was forced! and i have to recover some material. this is a move that fritz considers, but eventually prefers qg5. find white's move here. fritz agrees with this move - after some thought! he takes back. what would you play here as white? this is far better than the obvious 24. qxd4+ fritz agrees that this is the best move for black too. what now to keep white's attack going? white is still materially down and must be active before black develops his pieces to good squares and takes over the initiative.  fritz looks at this and agrees that it is better than qxd4, but fritz finally settles on rd1 or bc4. forced as kxc5 leads to him being mated with rc1+ etc and kd7 loses his queen to bb5+. fritz gives this as plus 3.94 to white now. and what now? keep checking! fritz likes this move. forced again. what now? did you find this? another pawn sacrifice that black cannot accept. 27...qxc6 28. rc1 wins the black queen and bxc6 28.	ba6+	is also winning for white very easily. black is lost, this is a reasonable attempt, hoping to get the queens off and escape to an ending when he has rook for bishop and two pawns. fritz prefers taking the bishop with check, but both win easily. forced again. fritz prefers 29. rc1. i looked at 29. rc1 but didn't play it as i was concerned about the reply 29....d3 but fritz points out that this can be met with 30. qe5+ winning. now white can meet 29....d3 with 30. qc4+ and 21. bxd3. nevertheless fritz thinks this is the best line for black, leaving white "only" 2.44 up. but black takes here. what now? fritz likes this. forced. what now? fritz agrees this is best. fritz thinks this is best. fritz agrees this is best, and gives the position as plus 7.34 for white. fritz thinks kc6 is better, but in either case it is hopeless. fritz agrees this is best and agrees black's position is resignable, which is exactly what black did in this position. many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system, so i know how i am doing in these annotations. until next time dear reader!

i think it was gm bent larsen who once stated that sometimes chess is pure mathematics, sometimes art and sometimes a pure boxing match. this kings indian really had the boxing aspect! this has been played thousands of times, but now white has to decide between main lines like: ne1, nd2, a4 or b4. more or less it all comes to the same: white attacks on the q-side, black on the k-side. the battle is on. black tries to control the important square c5 for as long as possible, but i must admit bg7 looks awful. nevertheless it is still well known theory. only chance for black is to keep the pawns rolling on the k-side. in poker they call it "all in!". i prefer this to the immediate 18. - h5 idea. for the time being the rook defends the weak pawn on c7, and in the future it can swing over to g7 or h7. i thought this position was fun to look at: the pawn chains! then i looked at my bg7 again and didn´t think it was so much fun anymore. but at least it protects the king. i had a long think here. i am about to be crushed on the q-side and decided for a dubious sac on h3. and a sac in return! is it necessary? i had expected something like 25. qd2 and 26. bd1 to avoid the mate threats, but the position is rather unclear. still i don´t think black has enough compensation for the bishop. black is up a pawn in the endgame, but how often do you reach an endgame in a kings indian? rather have a weak d6 pawn than a weak c7 pawn. the black bishop can always protect the d6 pawn from f8. another good reason for playing 18. - rf7: suddenly the rook challenges whites back rank. in my opinion 36. bf2 is better. with the bishop pair still on, white is still almost equal in spite of a pawn down. white has played a very good game so far, and i guess he saw i mate on g8 in some lines after rg4, but this blunder looses on the spot. 38. ne2 qb4 39. rh1 is still better for black but far from decisive. with the deadly threat h7-h5 or nf6 and white will have to give up the exchange. last chance was 40. nd1 h5 41. rxg6 qxg6 with a lost endgame. with a forced mate in maximum 10 moves.  no, the kings indian is not for players with bad nerves!

hi everyone!  in our wtw&lr club, julio (easy-win) decided to take me on - brave one!  however, i have played opponents well south of my rating and they, such as dmaestro and the dentist have given me some really tough games and i have had to battle passivitis in the middlegame.  will julio also inflict this on me?  well, maybe, but we do go into an endgame, a rook endgame and one player has a pawn minus.  but which player will eventually prevail?  well, you will just have to read on. 1. …… nf6 - in response to the reti opening, julio decides that piece development is the way to go! 2. …. c6 - after 3 knights come out to play here comes a pawn move.  this move prepares d5 of which black plays on the next turn. 4. e5 - somehow this has transposed into a kind of alekhine's defense but with a few moves inserted in the interim. 6. be2 - clearing the way for henry to tuck himself away on the kingside. 9. be3 - further development and additional defense of d4 pawn. 10. bxd4 - pawn trade. 13. …… qxf6 - after this plethora of exchanges i have got rid of my weakie on e5.  julio does have a pawn centre which at first sight looks strong.  however, there is a backward pawn on e6.  can this be exploited?  well, bringing material to attack it at the moment is a long way off. 16. a3 - to prevent b4. 17. …… qg6 - allo, allo, allo, i must watch it here, julio's queen bearing down on henry on the g column and there is a light square bishop bearing down on the a8-h1 diagonal.  however, there are a few pieces in the way so a defense can be mustered in time. 19. ……. nxe5 - knight trade. 21. …… bxc4 - b for n trade. 22. qd4 - glenda moves into an attacking position where she cannot be assailed by julio's bishop.  she also blocks up that diagonal leading to henry - a good way of defending there, glenda! 23. qg4 - offering a queen trade but the bq moves off the file. 25. ….. rf7 - preparing raf8 and suddenly i will be faced with a pile-on on the f column. 27. ……. rxf4 - the queens are now traded off. 29. nd7 - suddenly threatening nc5 and nxf6. 30. ….. bc6? (bc8) - loses pawn. 31. …… be8 - draw offer. 32. rxg6 - declined as i am a pawn up and i thought it was best to play on to see how i could realise this advantage. 32. ….. hxg6?! - leaving himself with doubletons, is that wise?  i think that bxg6 looked stronger. 34. nd4 - i am carefully considering my own weakie on b2.  i am preparing to exchange it by moving it to b3. 35. ….. rb7 - julio finally attacks my b pawn.  however, my rook can now defend it on the rank rather than the file and this gives my rook much more scope.  also my rook could get attacked by julio's lsb if it goes to b1. 38. kf2 - the kings now start moving towards the centre. 40. kg4 - henry really likes the look of that juicy p(r)awn on g4.  it can be defended, however but this gives me the opportunity to trade pieces. 43. ke5 - now we have our rook ending. 45. kxd5 - pawn trade. 47. kxc4 - gobble, gobble! 49. g3 - suddenly i spot the possibility of king julio being caught in a mating net on the h column! 50. …… ra4? - this move now leads to a rook trade into a won k & p ending. 52. ra5 - like this! 56. fxg5+ - there is no saving the pawn on a6 and glenda making a re-appearance on a8.  julio sees this and waves the white flag.  solid play from julio up until he left his e6 pawn en prise.  when you are down on pawn material in an endgame it pays to keep at least a piece on to give you some drawing chances.  i hope you have all had a good read and there will soon be another annotation coming up, this one will feature tactics in the middlegame which will net heavy material.

questa è la variante mccutcheon della francese. il seguito più giocato è 6.ad2, ma questa variante non è niente male il nero ama i rimedi drastici e gioca col fuoco. 7...g6 o 7...rf8 sono i seguiti normali 8. cge2 è semplice e soddisfacente, ma il bianco vuole alimentare la tensione se il nero avesse scelto di proseguire con  8... h5 il bianco avrebbe dovuto scegliere tra  a) lo spettacolare sacrificio di donna 9. hxg5!? hxg4 10. txh8+ af8 11. cxe4 dxe4 12. ce2 dove sembra che il bianco abbia  compenso per il materiale sacrificato b) la "tranquilla"  9. dd1! cxc3 10. dd2! dove il bianco ha vantaggio dopo, per esempio  10...cxa2 11. c3!  era forse questo il momento per il nero di giocare  9... h5  e se 10. hxg5 cxd4! 11. cxd4 da5 con una posizione complicatissima ma equilibrata  scatenando una tempesta di complicazioni.  il calcolo delle varianti è fondamentake per valutare questa posizione, non ci si può basare su ragionamenti astratti il dedalo di varianti porta a scoprire seguiti affascinanti, vediamo per esempio 11... hxg4 12. txh8+ rd7 13. cxe4  e ora: a) 13... dxa2 14. c2c3 da1+ 15. cb1 dxe4 16. dxc5+ rc7 17. g6! con forte attacco b) 13... dxe4 14. c3! con vantaggio  sembra che il bianco in questa drammatica posizione abbia trascurato 12. g6!! che vince subito! lascio a voi di verificare con le analisi!  il nero perde l'ultimo tram  bisognava tentare 12... hxg4 13. txh8+ rd7 e ora  a) 14. g6 fxg6 15. th7+ rc6 16. ab5+ rb6 17. dxc5+ axc5 18. ad2 e non è del tutto chiaro se il bianco ha compenso b) 14. th7! con una posizione complicatissima ma sostanzialmente equilibrata  la mossa vincente! non sembra esserci di meglio, ad esempio:  13... fxg6 14. dxg6+ rd8 15. dg7 oppure  13... hxg4 14. txh8+ rd7 15. g7  se 14... txh5 15. g7 se invece 14... tf8 15. bxc3 dxc3 16. txd5!! dxd5  e il bianco dovrebbe vincere sia dopo 17. ac4!  che dopo 17. g7  la sassata finale! il nero abbandona visto che non c'è possibilità di resistenza sia dopo 17... dxd5 18. gxf7 che dopo 17...rc7 18. tb5

this is how the breyer's system begins.  and, it is also where the voting begins.  simon: 10.d4 with the knight undeveloping itself, an aggressive more into the centre seems best to me.   white has opening advantage plus an extra two tempi?  joe: my vote is similar, but it would be 10.d3 the idea being to prevent an exchange because if 10.d4, she can play 10...exd4, and i'm keeping in mind what kenneth_fiore_3 told me about exchanges which is to hold off on that. and, that was due to me getting impulsive and doing so whenever possible which is a big no no.  ion: i'll join in... ... but for reasons of a rather erratic attention span (i've only just seen this thread though it must be three days old already) i do not wish to 'captain' the side. i reckon charleshiggie would be very suited to the role.   my vote: 10.d4   seems to me as good a time to stake a big claim on the centre, and it frees the q-side for development.   black's immediate programme will be to reorganise her q-side. we can use that time to develop our own.  jeremy: i also vote 10.d4   it's a bit aggressive but with the position, and the knight not challenging, we stake a nice claim on the center, open a space for our dsb to move, and gets us one step closer to completing development.  joe: could change, but my vote, for now, is 11.d5 as that prevents an exchange. the only drawback is that our development is hindered since that same pawn will be moving.  simon: i vote 11.nd2 this seems the obvious way to develop the knight as the c3 square isn't available. from here it'll probably go to f1 and then g3 for a kingside assault, which would free our bishop on c1 at the same time.   white could also consider 11.c4 or 11.a4 to threaten on the kingside but it feels a little premature to me.   jkarp - i think the exchange would be to our benefit. if ...exd4 then cxd4 and we have a central pawn duo and good control of the centre.  joe: i agree with you simon which is why janet did not play 10...exd4 so, i change my vote. i like 11.nd2, but this appears to cramp knight. then, again, there are situation where this must be done. however, another move that develops which i was also thinking about was 11.bg5. therefore, this is my new vote. although not even a half pin, there appears to be some pressure against janet's nf6. and, in somewhat similar positions to this and the same scenario as we're seeing here, i have played moves like this. therefore, my vote is now 11.bg5.  ion: the quieen's knight... ... will develop via nb1-d2-f1 and the e3 or g3 as we think best. i believe we can afford to maintain the tension in the centre for now. let black exchange if she durst. i don't reckon she will. if she plays 11...bb7, we can support the e-pawn with 12.bc2.  ion: i suggest... 12.bc2.   reason is that we will want to move the d2-knight again very soon, in order to free the dark-square bishop. the knight will have to go to f1, and thence to e3 or (more likely) g3. but before moving the knight we ought to ensure the protection of the e-pawn, hence playing the bishop move first.  joe: i don't know how this frees a square for the n. as that moves the lsb, as opposed to, the dsb. i know that bf1 would. therefore, believe it or not, my vote is the same as ion but for a different reason. if it were for freeing the n, i'd vote 12.nf1. but, what i like about 12.bc2 is that the both of the bishops are nicely aligned. as i analyzed a training game between adevela and steppenwolf. and, what i learned just by being a spectator is that you want your b's aligned and vertical to each other. so, 12.bc2 is my vote.  ron: i would also suggest 12. bc2. that's if i can join in on this game. i know it would be the 3rd time moving this piece, but i like the bc2 position.   simon: 13. nf1 continuing the plan.   13. a4 or 13. b3 are also worth considering.  ion: i'd be ... ... happy with 13.nf1 or 13.a4. if there is otherwise an even split, i'll probably go with the knight move. the a4 move is on the cards sooner or later. it can afford to await the further development of our pieces.  jeremy: i really like b3 to activate the dsb and prepare for a4 (coming). nf1 is an interesting decision, but my preference is b3.  charles: on this opening database, nf1 seems to be the most popular move, but a4 and b3 seem to score better...  joe: which is my vote. and, that's because the idea is freeing up our dsb. so, my vote is for 13.nf1.  simon: i can definitely see the merits of a4 and b3.   if we go down the nf1 and subsequently ng3 or ne3 then we'll have ended up moving the knight three times and the bishop 3 times, which is hardly what the grandmasters recommend!   by playing b3 (or a4 and b3 later) we can develop the bishop without having to move the knight again and hopefully retain more opening advantage.   i'll switch my vote to b3 just to keep things interesting.   joe: i'm not sure exactly what to do. 14.nf1 looks good. but, seeing that we have freed our bc1 with the fianchetto, my vote is 14.bb2 to take advantage of that long diagonal.  simon: i like 14. bb2 here to develop the bishop and add pressure to the long diagonal.  ion: i suggest... ... we carry in with normal development: nf1 followed by ng3  jeremy: bb2 is my vote. the knight moves​ take from our tempo advantage.  ion: the knight moves ... ... must happen sooner or later. i don't think it makes much difference what we do within reason: bb2, nf1, even d5 - all seem reasonable moves to me, and would have no quarrel with any of them.   janet: 14.bb2 or 14.a4 was essential.  ion: oops - - methinks i made a boo-boo, and have contributed to our having to fight a thankless defence for the rest of the game. my blunder: i simply didn't check.   let that be a lesson. take the time (i was in a bit of a needless hurry), and when offering a move for selection, make a case.   it might also be an idea to examine others' options and be prepared to argue for or against. usually i try to do this, but chose an occasion in which i didn't to propose a lemon.   at this point i see nothing better than 15.cxd4, but suggest we look further.  even if it is not the moral of the story, janet's next post is a very important lesson, so i have decided to tie it in with the moral for the annotation.  that's because with different defenses, and more then just two he has implied how important it is to study variations.  what he has told me is to play moves that are most played by masters and grandmasters.  of course, you don't know what they always play.  but, what he has implied is that it is very important to study the variations carefully as the moral to some of my games.  janet: i would be willing to call this game a draw,start over up till move 14. 14.nf1 is a bad error. but it seems it was caused by a slight vote count error. it is more important to study this opening variation then for me to have an easy win. mr lopez and mr.breyer would be disappointed.... let me know guys.  ion: thanks, janet. i do not believe that we could make a successful defence of this as it stands: a pawn ffalling, and a centre pawn at that.   what do the rest of youse jokers reckon?  jeremy: agreed to draw.   
-------------------------------------
time to annotate a game i won for a change. i am not a confident attacker and even less confident when making sacrifices so this game was a little nerve-wracking for me. moves like this are what it takes for me to try to attack out of the opening, because if i let someone get away with it, then how grievous could such a waste of time really be? the göring gambit of the scotch game goes 1. e4 e5 2. nf3 nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3. its goal, like the goal of many gambits, is (at least in part) to gain a lead in development. because white already has a lead in development thanks to each side's third move, i overcame my aversion to giving away pawns in the opening, with, ideally, an even greater lead in development as compensation. at some point here the game database comes into play. here black picks the most common move in this position. as do i in this position. the position after white's 7th move is in the world database precisely once, but has been reached nearly 100 times on gameknot. 7...bxc3 is most popular here. black's actual move is played more often than the knight to f6, but i'm not sure why.  this is a move i really suspect of being attributable to the database. even though 8...bd6 is only in the database twice, black won both times. however, i don't see how it can be good as it blocks the d-pawn. i leave the database here (earlier games saw 9. be3 and 9. e5). this move discourages 9...nxd5. black has a lot of potential exchanges on the table now, and each exchange helps black. i'm starting to get pretty nervous already. 12...o-o 13. nf6+ just seems terrible for black, so he avoids castling. but he is many moves from being able to castle queenside--four, at the very least. this should give white time to build up even more of an attack. opening the dark-squared bishop's diagonal. even though white has quite a bit of time now before black can get his king to safety, i'm still feeling bad about this. for one thing, where are the open lines to black's king? obviously not 14...bxb2 when 15. bxc7 traps the black queen ignominiously.  and here white has the "safe" 16. rad1 or the more violent... is it good? probably not. however, this may be the only chance to play this sacrifice--16...nc6 was on the table. threatening mate. black only has two options here, and picks what must be the wrong one. i expected 17...rg7 when i made the knight sacrifice, and was planning 18. qxh6 rg8 (or kf8) 19. qxf6 here. i think white has some play there, otherwise i'm not playing 16. nf6+ at all, but when black played this move instead, i began to feel a lot better. now black demonstrates a stubborn unwillingness to give up the queen. while there is no way to do so and stay ahead in material, it would have resulted in an endgame where black has a rook and knight for it and might still be able to put some play together. i like this move. i saw it after 17...rf8. this is the really stubborn move to save the queen, but it looks absolutely silly hiding over there on b8. if black goes with 19...bxe6 20. rxd8+ kxd8 21. fxe6 fxe6 22. qxh6, it's that losing endgame again, but it's not completely hopeless. a stalemated king is never good; even worse when the queen is trapped with nothing to do; and even worse when one rook is stalemated and the other staring at doubled pawns on its file. black resigns. he could still play on with 22...c5, which loses a piece but is the only move that doesn't lead to instant annihilation. one variation (hardly forced) that i would very much have enjoyed playing through to the end was 22... c6 23. be6+ kc7 24. qxe7+ kb6 25. qb4+ ka6 26. re3 b5 27. ra3+ kb6 28. qa5+ kb7 29. rd7+ kc8 30. rxf7# - but the position of black's king and queen in the actual final position is amusing enough. 
-------------------------------------
il mio scopo era catturare la torre in a8...ho pensato un pò e ho visto che sacrificando il cavallo mangiando il pawn in d5.... ....potevo attuare il mio piano...scacco con donna in f7... ....eccolo... ...il re è costretto alla fuga in d8 ...nuovo scacco... a questo punto interporre regina o cavallo non avrebbe comunque impedito la cattura della torre

-------------------------------------
this game was played in 5 days, more or less. too quick by each side. specially, his. since he was in a strong position after the opening, but i could surprise him with a tactic. no way, it is difficult to find someone playing the "normal" c4, in order to practice the budapest. now, i have to improvise. and the db offers the widest variety of followings... too many to study them.  it seems to be a good idea to fight for the white diagonal. it is not true... but it is a plan. to fianchetto the other bishop is possible, and possibly good. but two "passive" moves are too much for my style. i am planning c5, of course... just getting even, and boring. i can play d5, transposing to something that i think is called the tartakower. i am always defeated playing with white... but as black, i am not sure how to go on, so i tried to get some movement.  ok. his pawns are strong. and my dsb has not a good place to go, unless i change it with the c3 knight. hmmm... anyway: i am delaying to move the d pawn, in order to control e5 with d6. and i don't like to play the bishop on e7, it's just too passive. so, i tried something else.  ...with the intention to get rid of his dsb after bf4, g5, etc...  planning an early attack on the semi-open e column, taking advantage of the position of my king, still far from castling due to my stupid idea of delaying developement.  a plan is a plan. this is in order to provoke, after g4, ne5, d6. trying to control the game, that is already going out of it... another loss of time... but nb5 is really bad for me. if i want to develop my queen to c7 and my bishop to d6, i had to prevent the knight's jump.  no problem. everything but avoiding the white diagonal to be blocked. d5 whorted a look... but i wanted to keep to my plan of d6.  yes! why not? my dsb can always develop on g7, controlling a very nice open diagonal... i am not really in a nice position, but i was not so stupid as to play qxe6. besides, i had to give the nb8 a square, since i didn't want it to block my bishop's action on the white diagonal. his queen has to take care of bxn, always. and if he jumps to d4, this is not a very dangerous position for me... not right now.  yummy pawn, isn't it?  but i have made room for my knight on purpose...  time to be aggressive, and go on with my plan. i think i cannot longer dream of a real attack, but... the "normal" bg7 is just too slow. white clouds are condensing in the nearest skies... i thought about e5, but... no, it is too dangerous.  when in danger, exchange. his dangerous bishop is the dsb, not the lsb, but it is better than nothing.  winning a tempo to double the rooks on the d column... this is going... whiter and whiter .-) last try. this is a yummy move for him! you see: to attack the c5 pawn is not a plan. it is too easy for him to defend it. so, just let it be. more than that: be prepared not to exchange it if he advances it, in order not to open the c column for his threatening rooks.  i confess, at this point, that i honestly believed i will lose. ok, ok, now i have an ugly duty: to defend it with the queen.  qc2 and i almost resign. but he didn't play it.  now, a breath. this "osè" move, and i have space to move my king to b7. more than that, i prevent his qe5! it was a good moment to get the dsb out of it initial square? maybe, but after be6, i had to retreat it. and, i insist, i didn't want to passively play it on e7. on g7, maybe. but it will be aiming to an empty diagonal...  rd2 was better, in my opinion, not losing the advantage of a possible developement of the f1 rook.  it was a pity to exchange my bishop, but bc5, nxb, and his bishop will be too dangerous over the black squares.  now i am threatening e5? not at all. but it is better than nothing. now, if he plays bd2, i will lose b3 and the game.  nice for me! ugly. he could play qe3, adding pressure to the weak b6.  now, the situation is less unbalanced. my pieces are all playing...  thank you. now he has to lose a tempo in order to get his rook into the attack.  oh oh. he doesn't see a wonderful combination here... i did! and he cannot take back the bishop because of the mate in e1! but he could play nxb6+... anyway, a piece less with no compensation (almost no compensation) must have seemed a suffering, after such a promising opening...

una posizione veramente molto curiosa, direi quasi da studio. e qui sembro in svantaggio, e in effetti la valanga dei pedoni bianchi sembra refutare la mia apertura (lo so che non � buona, lo so, ma...) fin qui, sembra che le bianche siano uscite bene dall'apertura, hanno pi� spazio, e stanno attaccando. ma... vedete, quando i miei avversari sono in vantaggio, devono giocare molto bene :-) oh oh, avranno detto le bianche. i miei soliti "rischi". era troppo facile mettermi in d5 con il cavallo, per� non era male lo stesso. il cavallo bianco deve ritirarsi, e la torre va in d3. ma non era cos� semplice, c'erano molte alternative. con questa, la minaccia era in d2, con il cavallo, ma io puntavo addirittura alla donna bianca! perch� non cavallo in e2? ho voluto sfruttare un po' la colonna aperta... he he... anche qua forse la cosa migliore era semplicemente cambiare l'alfiere. la chiave della combinazione. un'arma a doppio taglio, per�, come vedremo poi... gira e rigira, si arrivava comunque a questo punto, e le bianche sono scomodissime! e fino a qui, tutto come previsto. adesso sono in vantaggio, no? invece, non � cos� semplice.  qui non ho saputo vedere il pericolo che correva il mio cavallo, nel senso che, anche se non sembra a prima vista, non sa dove andare. dovevo metterlo in a3e poi b5 per conservarlo. e adesso mi rendo conto che la mia donna � virtualmente inutile, anzi, diventa un problema.  bisogna sempre stare attenti alla doppietta del cavallo in e8. gi�, per� adesso c'� sempre il rischio che la torre bianca occupi la colonna d, cosa che se faceva adesso, vinceva! se salvo il cavallo, per esempio in b6, td4, minacciando td7, dc8, txf7, con minaccia imparabile di matto in h7!!!!!! per fortuna non l'ha vista! forse potevo guadagnare il pedone e5, ma il cavallo si perdeva, poco ma sicuro! meraviglie degli scacchi! se la donna nera non si muove, rimane bloccata, con possibilit� di scacco al re e alla donna con la torre difesa dal cavallo, eventualmente. potevo anche tentare b6, ma comunque la torre non deve passare alla colonna d! e adesso comincia una lunga tortura, nella quale gioco sempre con il rischio di finire nei guai se smetto di dare scacco per tentare qualsiasi cosa, per l'occupazione della colonna d e le minaccie varie con la torre. incredibile, dopo aver vinto la donna, rimango quasi bloccato! non serviva a niente avanzare il re. incredibile, � ancora in trappola! questo � stato un tentativo di rompere la patta per ripetizione. ormai era chiaro che la mia unica possiblit� era mangiare qualche pedone e poi cambiare la mia donna per entrambi i pezzi bianchi, e vincere un finale di re e pedoni! incredibile! non pu� giocare th4 per df5  e perde il pedone in e5, un pezzo chiave per le bianche. questi sono i momenti imbarazzanti per le bianche... che devono fare? secondo me un grosso errore. dovevano resistere con te3, e non so se sarei riuscito a "rompere" la fortezza bianca.  
-------------------------------------
una vittoria non troppo meritata, ma comunque... qua, la mia paura era f5! quindi, logico, parare f5... mi aspettavo comunque g5, anche se gli cambio l'alfiere. l'alternativa ah6 non era da scartare. dopo 12. g4, ce7, 13.g5, ag7, il fianco di re era bloccato (14. h4 era lenta per le bianche), e il mio cavallo poteva tornare indisturbato in f5, dove esercita un'azione efficace. ma ho preferito creare minaccie. di nuovo, le bianche dovevano pensare a g5, subito! adesso se g5, ce7, g6, ag7 e torniamo a prima: il fianco di re � bloccato, anche se il mio alfiere nero � imprigionato, posso continuare la partita con una posizione leggermente pi� scomoda, ma con il vantaggio della colonna c aperta. se non g5, almeno g6 andava bene per il bianco. grosso errore.  adesso � difficile continuare l'attacco. 15... ag3 era una possibilit�, anche se dava la possibilit� di 16. cc3, che libera un po' le bianche. non potevo permettere che le bianche arroccassero, perch� la loro posizione si solidificava. ho pensato anche a 15... ac1, ma dopo 16. b3 non era chiaro il mio vantaggio, dato che la torre vedeva la casella c1 occupata dal mio stesso alfiere. allora... qui, con 18. cc3, le bianche potevano continuare la partita. ma... 19. ce1, dxd4 e le bianche perdono la torre a1. perci� hanno abbandonato. 
-------------------------------------
una sconfitta vergognosa, ma anche cosï¿½ sono gli scacchi.  errore. in questo schema d'apertura, in questo caso bisogna ritirare la donna in a5, proprio per evitare o rendere meno efficace la mossa seguente. altro errore. di nuovo, ï¿½ da giocare da5. se b5 subito, axc, e se c6xa, cf6xd5 con minacce e complicazioni. anche se non lo fa, comunque non vinco il pezzo. cosï¿½, la posizione non ï¿½ troppo brutta. sono indietro con lo sviluppo, ma questo ï¿½ normale, e non mortale, se giocata bene. adesso, perï¿½, sï¿½ che "cedo alla tentazione" e faccio b4.  volevo ottenere di piï¿½ dalla posizione, ma lei (?) ha giocato a rischio, sfruttando il suo maggiore sviluppo dei pezzi.  qui era meglio axc, ho sottovalutato il pericolo. forse. non so se c'era modo di salvarsi e guadagnare il pezzo, giurerei di sï¿½, ma non sono abbastanza abile da giurarlo.  non mi negherete che la posizione ï¿½ interessante e complicata. se sopravvivo, ho un pezzo in piï¿½ per due pedoni. se sopravvivo, perï¿½. qui, le analisi sono diventate cosï¿½ complicate e ricche di varianti e trappole nascoste, che, confesso, mi sono perso.  sembra strana, ma se cxc, dxd5 . e se d5xc4, una marea di possibilitï¿½, ma mi ï¿½ sembrato probabile che il pedone bianco insieme alla colonna c gli desse troppo vantaggo.  l'idea ï¿½ che il suo stesso pedone copre la colonna, quindi mi protegge un po'. adesso, la tentazione era ad6, ma allora tc6 mi metteva in serie difficoltï¿½. d'altra parte, non scordiamoci che io ho sempre "sotto mira" f2... ho pensato anche a ac5, forse era migliore! cercando di scambiare pezzi per alleggerire la situazione. tentativo un po' disperato, non sono stato capace di ragionare bene. se cxt, d5xc6 , naturalmente. txt, d5xc6 forse era l'unica. ma dopo non potevo prendere c6 perchï¿½ cxf6 e perdo il cavallo centrale. allora ho avuto la "brillante" idea di cambiare l'alfiere bianco per quel cavallo cattivo cattivo...  beh, ho una torre netta di vantaggio. complimenti alla signora, che si ï¿½ cacciata in una posizione cosï¿½! ma questo ï¿½ stato il mio errore definitivo. il fatto ï¿½ che non avevo visto la combinazione successiva. se avessi mangiato di donna, non avrebbe potuto farla, e forse avrei vinto! unica per evitare il matto subito, fornendo una via d'uscita al mio re via f6. soluzione comunque fasulla. un'imprudenza fatale qualche mossa fa. come si sarï¿½ rallegrata :-(((( 
-------------------------------------
a very intense game, with mistakes on both sides, and a very nice and interesting two-against-one-knight-but-more-pawns game. deviando dalla mia linea normale, che include c6, ecc.  se cxe4, dxg2! inoltre, se cxe4, dxc e non pu� prendere l'alfiere perch� � inchiodato. se cxe4, dxc e non pu� prendere l'alfiere perch� � inchiodato. qui per� comincia a diventare pericoloso, per cb5... di nuovo latente dxg2... qui mi ha risparmiato la vita. con dxe la mia posizione rimane scoperta ed inferiore.  bello e strano schema, no? anche se sono indietro con lo sviluppo... tutto calcolato.  penso che la mossa giusta fosse ag3, mantenendo la pressione. anche se recupero il pedone, la sua posizione � pi� aggressiva della mia.  e qui commette un errore fatale... se te1, cf4. se te3, anche.  ma qui lo commetto io... ed eccomi con un pezzo in pi�, ma ben tre pedoni in meno! il piano � che se rf4, ce6 , e se cxc, rxc!. se segue rxc, il pedone passa e se h6, rf7 lo blocca e vinco. mica male. ma... mi obbliga a perdere un tempo. e non posso ritirare il cavallo, n� difenderlo, senn� c corona.  ! se prendo il pedone b4, non sono sicuro di riuscire a sopravvivere, quindi cerco lo scacco perpetuo. he offered drawn here, and black refused! ma anche qui ho valutato male la situazione. con la prossima mossa, gli lascio la possiblit� di fare patta, mentre invece, non so se avrei potuto evitarla e persino vincere. se movevo il re in c6, per esempio... non lo so.  
-------------------------------------
questa mossa è un errore. bisogna rassegnarsi: l'alfiere si deve mettere lì solo dopo che il bianco gioca af4, sennò... this move is a mistake. the bishop should be played there only after white plays bf4, otherwise... ...lo si perde per nulla! you lose it for nothing.  now the plan is to act in the h column, but it is not easy to see how.  i thought i was risking in order not to stay passively, playing the queen to a5, just to take it away from the danger, but letting him go on with an attack on the center... almost the only move not to lose the queen. the feared one.  now, a blunder. i should have moved the queen instead, but with no hope.   
-------------------------------------
"my" scandinavian, almost model.  un bell'attacco contro la mia scandinava. ma ho avuto un buon momento, un po' di fortuna... till now it seems almost a manual about the opening, the way i play it.  more often, my white-squared bishop is taken before the knight goes to e7, so the h7 pawn goes in g6.  note that if i retake the bishop with the e7 knight, an inmediate d4-d5 is possible. i cannot say if it is really mortal, but i prefer not to find out in a live game. the opening of the h comumn for black proves decisive in the future, despite its innocent aspect right now. secondo i miei calcoli, � possibile giocare sia cd7-f6, sia f7-f6, nonostante il pericolo. la chiave sta nell'arrocco lungo, con minaccia di presa alla regina dopo lo scoperto ah2 .   i must admit i didn't see this "trick" after the b - n exchange. but i decided to make the best of it.  and here, the position "smells" like if i have something. but nothing can be done yet.  now, i think it should have been better to get out the knight via d5-f4 thinking on a sacrifice in h3.  you have to know when to stop pushing your luck. i cannot go on with my attack right now.  i love risk. i think he didn't expect this one. if g3, rxa3  seems to start something, even with the diagonal self blocked. now, he didn't risk, but why? g3, rxa3  kg2, and then? rxg3 ?  f2xg3, bxg3 if wnite tries to retain material with re4, he probably succeed, so i think this was a blunder of mine.  he wants to go on with the attack, but this is not a good move. now the knight menaces g3  and a sacrifice starts to glitter. unfortunately, this is necessary to protect e5 but also to give my king an escape square in f7. i like my ability to stay calm under strong attakcs. the mistake he did. thanks. otherwise, the game is still to play. and i think this is a good move for an average player like me.  the best. kxb leads to e4 , then nxbf3... again, i choosed a good moment to stay calm. in my previous moves, i had to calculate all the danger coming from the white queen and knight. it was fun. the incredible fact of this game is that i win with my pawns, pushing them with my king behind them against a queen, the rooks and a knight... i could have pushed my bishop to h2 before, but, as always, "time" is precious. i must act before he can react, i have very few moves left.  why not ng4? anyway, i can imagine white thoughts: black has a discovered king, i have four pieces pointing at it... how can i be in danger? just some move to take away this fly, and i'll will go for a win. but...  this move was a mistake. with the next one i go further on with my attack, and the queen gets away from the danger zone, while the king is fully in it.   ok, so what? i am proud of the next move, i think it is kind of decisive. of course, i calculate all possible variants, and i got a piece minimum.  note that rg4  is not a great move. rd8-h8 looks great, but gives he the chance of d6. then, i don't have an inmediate win. so the correct one is the following.  he believes that with this one is saved, since i have to change queens. nope! because my pawn makes the trap. is he aware of the danger?  but he gave me more. i calculated this position from move 33, not that bad for an average player like me. incredibly, after such an attacking position, white is trapped.  
-------------------------------------
ok, questo � il momento di dimostrare che le nere possono uscire indenni da questa posizione. ricca di tattica, sin d'ora... che ne dite? questa mossa permette c6xb2 , alla quale il re deve rispondere con rb8, e non prendere il pedone per non scoprire la diagonale bianca alle bianche. la scommessa � che questo pedone verr� perso, dalle bianche, prima o poi, e che quindi rimarrebbero in vantaggio. questo � stato calcolato sin da e5. non so se si poteva ottenere qualcosa di pi� dallo scambio. comunque, non mi lamento del risultato finale. qua si poteva giocare normalmente riprendendo il pedone, e la cosa rimaneva con un pedone meno per me. ma questo significava non aver dimostrato un bel niente! allora ho continuato a rischiare... fin qui avevo analizzato bene, e credevo di poter sopravvivere, nonostante l'apertura della colonna. anche il pedone c sarebbe caduto, prima o poi, e se resistevo l'uragano e scambiavo pezzi, sarei rimasto persino in vantaggio. la mossa giusta era th8-d8, per esempio, e non td3, perch� poi df4 vince.  invece ho fatto un errore inspiegabile (?), mi sono perso nelle analisi. bei colpi tattici mi aspettavano dopo dxa2, df5... anche se era comunque interessante.  l'alternativa era cd5, ma txf7 non mi faceva presagire niente di buono. � interessante da analizzare, ma ho visto troppi trucchi tattici delle bianche per fidarmi.  a questo punto, ho deciso per la soluzione che mi avrebbe portato, secondo i calcoli, ad avere una torre di meno (per colpa dello scambio delle donne e poi b8!), ma almeno era pi� sotto controllo della precedente.   
-------------------------------------
primo colpo di testa. secondo colpo di testa (forse meglio cf6). terzo colpo di testa. unica. rh1, ag1  e matto. ora, la semplice �: g4xf3 , 18. cxf3, ah3 , 19. rh1, poi una possibilit� � axt.*  un'altra �: 17. ..., ag1. 18. f4 (unica**), f6. 19. txag1, f6xg4. non pu� riprendere il pedone, quindi 20. cxaf5, e6xcf5, 21. th1, o-o, 22. txt, txt, e nonostante il vantaggio materiale (di ben 6 punti!), il bianco � senza molte risorse, e dopo g5xf4, il nero � in vantaggio, per esempio: 23. b5xc6, b7xc6, 24. dd2, g5xf4, 25. f3, g3, 26. th1, txt, 27. rxt, g5, minacciando dh7  e matto. se per esempio 28. de1, dh7 , 29. rg1, dh2 , 30. rf1 (unica), dh1#. (altre varianti danno patta per scacco perpetuo o il bianco perde la donna: 28. ad1...).   ma... c'� da fidarsi?  * ah3 . (non vale pi� ag1, perch� il cavallo difende h2). 19. rh1, e qui la semplice � axt. se il bianco riprende l'alfiere, sia con il suo alfiere che con la donna, con ae5  (scoperto), posso poi prendere il cavallo c3 e siamo pari di materiale, e il gioco pu� continuare.  se il bianco non riprende l'alfiere, pu� giocare per esempio 19. ce4 e allora non so bene, forse sono guai per me. ag3 (o d6) , rg1, axa, dxa, o  f6 ah4, g4 e al bianco rimane: cf3xg5, al che io dovrei rispondere axa, dxa, f6xg5, e se axg5, ag1 , rxg1, dh2  e matto, e se cxg5, txa, c o dxe6...  **questo � un grossissimo errore! non � l'unica. se txa, dh2  e il re "scappa" in f1, e rimango con un palmo di naso. infatti l'ha fatta, e...   adesso me ne sono reso conto! ah3 , 19. rh1, axt, (o ae5!?)  se: 20. dxa, ae5  (o af4 , ma � pi� pericoloso il cavallo -?-). 21. rg2 (o rg1), axc (minacciando matto in h2)  22. dg2 e axc e, nonostante l'attacco su c6, rimango in vantaggio.   se:  20. b5xc6, ae4 , 21. rg1, axc (minacciando dh2  e poi matto in f2).  22. ce4!, posso scegliere se salvare l'alfiere in h3 un'altra volta, o  22. ..., b7xc6, 23. rxaf1, f5, 24. (cg3 axf2 e non pu� riprendere perch� perde materiale, allora...) e il bianco ha anche lo scacco in h5, che blocca la mia torre. se salvo l'alfiere con 22. ..., ah3, 23. txb7 (e non posso riprendere, dovrei andare in de5, con 24. c7...  and here, the attack seems to be lost. now, i make my first "weird" move. notice that he cannot take the bishop, since bg8+ and mate.  now, ng3 would make me lose all my spin, so... if you calculate the position if white plays bxb thinking about exchanging queens, you'll see it gives me pawns d3 and c2.  necessary, otherwise my position will collapse. there is no mate anymore for black.  i needed this one in order to progress. if qxb, rh3. with a trick in my sleeve.  i would say this is the wrong one, as for my following.  it seems an almost even game. white should fear of my g pawn, but it is still playable. but i have a little pressure over d3, too... white is overloaded with little threats. if dxc, qxe6, with advantage - but still far from victory. he resigned here, and the game was probably lost for him, since he will lose another pawn.  
-------------------------------------
una simpatica vittoria, lavorata con cura nonostante alcune imprecisioni!) e non senza pericolo. in questa apertura, lo scambio dell'alfiere bianco � previsto, e viene parzialmente compensato dall'apertura della colonna a alla torre. per�, qui non ci sono le donne, e l'attacco nero � lento.  una lotta molto difficile contro un attacco bianco tematico ma potente. la chiave della difesa stava in questa. non devo perdere assolutamente il blocco dei pedoni in d per conservare qualche possibilit�. il cavallo dovr� aspettare pazientemente di uscire... grazie! ...con una strizzatina d'occhio ad un eventuale matto in e8. naturalmente non ci penso nemmeno a cambiare la torre, la coppia di alfieri bianchi sarebbe troppo superiore. e qua, la semplice td6 era forse la migliore. avevo paura poi che le bianche continuassero l'attacco e riuscissero a materializzarlo, ma il pedone in d5 doveva essere difeso. la prossima mossa non credo che sia cos� geniale come poi si � dimostrata, ma penso che sia interessante da analizzare.   cercare di togliere l'alfiere bianco dalla diagonale con la minaccia di matto finiva miseramente dopo a6, ad3... e mi rimaneva anche a6 debole. ecco, questa la chiave del movimento di torre in e1. fin qui, tutto come previsto. non sapevo se avrei poi finalmente vinto il pedone in a, e se mi convenisse aver perso quello in d4, ma almeno era un piano.  ma lui mi ha facilitato le cose!!!!!!!! pensavo allo scambio di questi pedoni, ma il piano � fasullo per il bianco, perch�... se tb5 , rc6, almeno pu� liberare l'alfiere.  e cos� vinco anche l'altro pedone, e sono in vantaggio!!!!! incredibile!!!!!!! l'inarrestabile d!  ma qui conveniva fare prima a6 (ora s�!), per prevenire...  vedete cosa mi piace di me? qui si pu� fare direttamente d2? se ae2, te1, e se af3, d1=d, axd1, txd1, vincendo, ma se axd2, axd2, txd2, non sono sicuro di conservare qualche vantaggio. stop, dunque! allora l'idea era avanzare qui, con l'alfiere ostruito.  d2, ae2, te1 obbliga a sacrificare la qualit� per il pedone, come minimo. non so perch� non l'ho fatto...  pensavo che questa fosse sufficiente... hehe, tanto sono difeso dal pedone f6. calcolavo di avere comunque un vantaggio sufficiente... no!!!!!no, non ce la far�. ma... come proseguo l'attacco? quello che segue si � svolto come calcolato. da fare prima, ma non ora! per�, lui mi ha perdonato. funzionava ancora il discorso di prima riguardo a ae2, te1? non tanto, perch� dopo lo scambio degli alfieri prendeva di torre con scacco, e gli rimaneva solo un problema, quello del pedone in a, ma comunque perdevo il mio. ma qui bisognava pensare a cc5, che obbligava a txd2 , axd2 e guadagno il pezzo. ma devo calcolare anche che ora il pedone h � libero, anche se credo di arrivare prima io con la torre... ma con questa... si trova bell'e intrappolata la torre!!!!  e deve sacrificarla per il pedone, perdendo una qualit� netta. adesso, per�, c'� da andarci piano. bisogna arginare con calma il problema del pedone in h, e non permettere agli alfieri bianchi, fortissimi, qualche "doppietta" strana, o qualche trucco... qui s� che � stato difficile andare avanti, e questa � la parte che mi piace di pi� della partita, per come ho giocato. tutto calcolato. il pedone arriva a h7, ma per colpa del pedone in f6 non pu� coronare! c'erano alcuni sacrificetti o scambi che potevano permettergli di coronare in altre varianti. credo di aver giocato bene in una posizione non facile. a meno che non veda qualche errore del bianco... s�, s�, la cosa poteva sembrare pericolosa, ma tutto era calcolato! e nulla pu� impedirmi di mangiare in h, e poi con calma portare a a coronare.  
-------------------------------------
una bella combinazione non vista da lui mi ha fatto vincere... senn�, chiss�! fin qui il mio schema normale con le nere. la prossima mossa del bianco non � quella tipica: 0-0, o ch4 per scambiare l'alfiere. quell'alfiere in realt� fa ben poco l�, anche se sembra minaccioso. qua l'importante � difendersi da un eventuale d5, che � sempre il pericolo in questa difesa (e nessuno la fa mai). e anche occupare la diagonale con l'alfiere qui, pi� che altro per neutralizzare il suo (al massimo riesce a scambiarlo per il mio, tutto qui). la "mira" su h2 non porta mai a nulla, ma preoccupa l'avversario. ecco la culminazione del mio schema: l'arrocco sul lato di donna, che cre pressione e "blocca" in una sola mossa d5. inoltre, apre la via per un eventuale attacco sul lato di re del bianco. una mossa cos� utile che la faccio, pur rischiando il contrattacco sul lato di donna (cio� sul mio re). la donna deve continuare a difendere f7. e qui la mia posizione � solida, anche se sono in ritardo con lo sviluppo. con l'arrocco lungo mi espongo ad un attacco sul fianco di donna, ma per esperienza so che ben difficilmente riesce. e io ho controgioco sul fianco re, anche se non � molto pericoloso per le bianche. lo scambio dell'alfiere bianco, se si pu� evitare � meglio, ma in questo schema bisogna rassegnarsi a cambiarlo per un cavallo. se porto la torre in d2, non faccio altro che dargli un tempo in pi� per cc5, che � buona per lui. sempre una mossa che, in questo schema, preoccupa l'avversario, anche se non � molto pericolosa. non si direbbe mai che in questo modo ottengo un bel contrattacco sul lado di donna.  sto minacciando cxc. non posso vincerlo, come vorrei. dovrá ritirarsi o mangiare (il che favorisce me), certo, corro il rischo di farmi intrappolare io la donna, ma... tutto calcolato!  (?) e qua sono io che "devo" aprire le ostilit�, senn� poi il suo attacco sul mio re lo pu� portare ad avere il vantaggio. cos� facendo, lascio il punto debole e6, cosa che non si deve mai fare in questa difesa. ma ho rischiato. meglio direttamente a5? qua comincia un bel ballo... cos� adesso lascio anche la via libera ai miei pedoni in g e h. certo, sto sudando freddo, anche se sembrerebbe, dato l'attacco avversario che � seguito, che, ancora una volta, il pericolo sull'arrocco lungo � relativo in quest'apertura.  non � la stessa cosa fare f4 che h4. se avanzo f4 lui non mangia, aspetta, e sa che io non mangio. se avanzo in f3, non faccio in tempo a difendere il pedone, portare la donna in h3 con minaccia di matto, prima che lui riesca a prendere i provvedimenti (ae4 e ce3). e non avrebbe senso prendere f4xg3, perch� scopre la mia colonna f all'azione della sua torre. quindi perdo altro tempo mandando avanti il pedone in h, ma cos� lo preoccupo ancora di pi�, anche se in realt� il mio attacco non ha seguito.  e qua forse si � spaventato un po'. comunque, avrebbe dovuto, perch� aprire la mia colonna h mi da comunque delle possibilit�. se qua faceva direttamente b5, scommetto che vinceva, e comunque mi obbligava a difendermi.  ma perch� difendere c3? se l'avessi preso, avrei solo fatto del bene a lui! io avrei magari fatto db2, rinforzando anche l'attacco... si � proprio spaventato! non vede che il suo attacco non � nel centro, ma sul lato di donna! sacrificare in b5 era "obbligatorio" per lui! e qua si sta difendendo lui, quindi per me va bene. se non agisco in fretta, per�, poi lui si render� conto, prima o poi, del suo attacco con i pedoni, e mi si butta sul re e io non ho pezzi l� per difenderlo... non solo lasciando posto ai miei cavalli, ma anche "puntando" al re. ho gi� in mente di fare qualche sacrificio tattico, ma non lo vedo ancora chiaro.  punta ancora, sbagliando, sulla debolezza di e6, che invece tanto debole non � (pu� facilmene venir difeso dal re e poi dal cavallo, oltre ad avere gi� due difensori. qui doveva star pensando ad un eventuale sacrificio axf5, con le sue torri e la donna facendo pressione. ma ha fatto i conti senza l'oste...  gi� qua potevo fare forse dxg3, se h2xd, th1 , rg2 (unica), t8-h2 , rf3 (unica), ma poi?  la mia torre deve difendere il pedone, non la donna. se ad2, muovo la donna e siamo daccapo, ma l'alfiere l� lo intralcerebbe, infatti poi fa... molto pi� intelligente per evitare th3 e varmi venire idee strane, come txg3, eventualmente. ma non una mossa buona. doveva fare per esempio tf-e2, per essere corente col suo nuovo piano. a scacchi bisogna seguire i propri piani, non c'� quasi mai tempo di cambiarli. d'accordo, volevo portare il cavallo in f4, d'accordo, ma neanche questo lo minacciava per niente (in apparenza. in effetti, rendeva possibile il sacrificio dxg3, ma non credo che lui questo l'abbia visto). qualche altra ragione per giocare g7-g5? beh, s�, minacciare f4 - ora s�. il fatto � che ormai "dovevo" attaccare, per forza, questo � il bello, perch� mi sta per piovere addosso sul re! eccolo. ma non ha visto la seguente, sennò questa non me la faceva... posizione interessantissima. non solo le nere possono sacrificare la donna, ma "devono" farlo, perch� senn� sono guai per il re.  le bianche hanno solo tg2 o rh1, le altre portano al matto.  in queste posizioni, bisogna calcolre anche i sacrifici pi� assurdi, a volte salta fuori qualcosa.  torre x h2, txt unica, df3 , ag2, txt , rxt, e qui il nero pu� pattare per scacco perpetuo (!?!? forse...?). ma deve accontentarsi del perpetuo? non posso vincere? se txt, df3 , dg2, cxd!?, txt, ce3 scoperto, poi prendo l'alfiere e come minimo faccio la doppietta col cavallo   rh2, e prendo la torre e5 e rimango in vantaggio... o faccio matto.  per� se txt , txt, df3 , rg1, ed � perpetuo (o vince). (questo � interessante da vedere, fatelo da voi. benedetta tattica).   il fatto � che non vedo molte mosse buone, eccetto txt. devo ritirare la donna, e in h4 non vedo a cosa serva. senn� in b3 o a3, per� non ci fa niente.   le analisi con db2 sono lunghe e complesse, non so se il suo attacco � forte, bloccato com'�... ma e se fa qualche sacrificio?  non so ancora se era txt era poi buona. ne ho fatta un'altra... guarda guarda, ecco cosa ci faceva la donna in b3... andare a minacciare l'alfiere da b1! non avrei mai creduto che me l'avrebbe lasicata fare. le bianche avrebbero dovuto giocare pazientemente t o de1 e trovare un'altro modo per proseguire l'attacco. sicuramente c'era, mentre io sono bloccato contro il suo re, nonostante l'aspetto minaccioso della posizione (avrei poi dovuto avanzare il pedone in g4-g3, ma insomma, meglio di quanto � successo poi). e qui la sua fatale svista. mio caro, non � solo che ti blocco l'alfiere, ma � che � difeso solo dalla torre, e guarda caso � la stessa torre incaricata di coprire il fatidico h2... il tipico caso di "due compiti vitali assolti da un solo pezzo". e abbandona, perch� � matto in due mosse. una posizione per "tactic server".

passief, pc6 of lc5 is actiever koningsgambiet, geeft vaak open spel (lg4 is actiever, geeft de mogelijkheid van pd4 na afruil op f3) (luchtgaatje voor de loper, en verhindert evt. a6 en b5 of pa5) (geeft dekking van e5 op, en blokkeert de dame en zwarte loper) (is sterker dan meteen pe4, gevolgd door d5; zwart mag van mij wel slaan op c3, want dxc3 geeft dan meteen de zwarte loper van wit vrij baan) (dit begreep ik niet helemaal, verhindert evt. een lange rochade) (verzwakt de zwarte stelling, nemen op f6 moet) (deze stelling was de bedoeling) (doorslaan op f7 was ook mogelijk: 15. txf7, txf7; 16. pxf7, kxf7; 17. dh5+ en 18. dxc5 – maar deze combinatie heb ik tijdens het spel niet gezien)  (deze zet verhindert een evt. mat achter de paaltjes, maar ook hier was doorslaan op f7 mogelijk en waarschijnlijk zelfs beter) (ik dacht even dat mat zou volgen, maar dat had ik verkeerd gezien, ik ga dus terug met mijn dame) en zwart geeft op, hij gaat mat op de volgende zet.

como no se debe jugar una escosesa !! gran error sacando la dama ahora que mis dos alfiles controlan las diagonales. para eso es el gambito goering ( escosesa ) mi maestro  dice que mejor dc2 las negras parecen estas ahogadas y la dama està en peligro porque esa diagonal es controlada por mi alfil negro trata de respirar abriendo paso al alfil pero es la dama la que tiene que proteger.
-------------------------------------
 el rey tambien està en el centro del tablero en la jugada 15 ya no hay tiempo ni para enrocarse y casi todos sus movimientos son obligados  el negro subestima la posiciòn y tiene que empezar a defenderse sin enrocarse bang !! a partir de esta jugada viene una lista de 8 patadas hasta terminar en mate. eso es si no se rinde antes bang ! sigue rh5 cf4 y peon !!

i've decided to annotate this game for a number of reasons. firstly it's between it's against an opponent 100 points north of my rating. it's from a kings gambit tournament and after the game ended, he was top of the ranking  with 11 points and i was joint next to bottom with 2. this is a fairly short game (22 moves) and the analysis suggests a total of only one inaccuracy, two mistakes and a single blunder which suggests to me that the game was fairly close overall  i wanted to try this tournament as even though most opponents are higher ranked than me i though it would be interesting and that has certainly proved to be the case.  starting position the gameknot database suggests this favours black, though at this stage i'm not clear why. the computer calls this a mistake. i'd already decided that i wanted to play aggressively and this seemed a reasonable start frees the diagonal for the lsb to threaten to skewer the white queen with bg4 though it can easily be parried this seems a high risk approach to me as if i can castle quickly i can get a rook on the e file to threaten the white king i can't yet see a better place for the bishop so i put it here so that i can castle and get my rook to the e file as planned. white looks a little cramped now. i think white here is trying to get some activity going and threatening the b7 pawn but i think i would be more worried about the open lines to my king. i had my eye on something like ne4 followed by qf2 which looks dangerous to me though i couldn't quite figure out how dangerous.  the computer calls this an inaccuracy preferring  8. kd2 qf2+ 9. qe2+ qxe2+  at this point i thought i might have been able to go for the kill but i couldn't see a way to achieve it, one possibility was ne4 threatening the fork on f2. the computer calls this a mistake preferring  … qf2 12. qd3 bb4 13. h3 bxf3+ 14. qxf3 qxd4 15. bd3 nc5 the computer calls this a blunder and i agree, fortunately for me i saw the reason why. this sort of exchange is always nerve wracking but i had looked at every other possibility i could think of and this seemed best, fortunately for me i hadn't miscalculated now i am a whole piece ahead on material i just need to ensure i don't make any mistakes i was surprised and pleased with this exchange. i'm happy to exchange and white is letting me. and white resigned, thanks for reading please comment and rate. i was very pleased with this win as it's one of the highest ranked players i have beaten without a timeout. 
-------------------------------------
un altro esempio di come la gente abbandona prima del tempo e gioca senza pensare. in questa apertura, l'alfiere bianco delle nere � condannato. spero di non cascarci mai con le nere! questo � il sacrificio tematico. da qualche parte devo trovare della teoria su questo. l'alternativa � 12. cg6, minacciando la torre.  qui si poteva anche pensare a muovere il cavallo in f3, ma io volevo aprire le colonne di fronte al re. il nero crede di avere aperto una colonna importante, ma per il bianco � facile difendersi con l'arrocco. il nero doveva invece impedire la presa del pedone, per esempio con h5, anche se permetteva g6. crede di essere furbo, ma ormai � fatta. era meglio g6 per il nero. piccolo tocco... potevo anche prendere direttamente con la torre, ma cos� la minaccia � ancora pi� forte. e adesso, anche se la donna scende in f2, posso anche lasciare che mi mangi l'alfiere! terribile errore.  d'accordo, ha perso un pezzo ma... abbandonare? 
-------------------------------------
una bella partita fino allo sbaglio, stupidissimo e fatale. comunque sono orgoglioso del sacrificio di torre. segue quello che secondo me � un grosso errore del nero. perch� mi da la possibilit� di chiudere il fianco di donna, dandomi carta bianca per agire in quello di re, che � sempre il mio obiettivo principale in questo tipo di apertura, e che credevo irraggiungibile dopo il mio errore (se c'� stato...) questa era l'intenzione segreta della presa della donna. niente di che, tra l'altro, perch� non � ancora possibile per me ad6 per dxa!  questa mi sembra una perdita di tempo del nero. prendo di alfiere o di pedone? non lo so... di pedone ha qualcosa di tattico, forse. se dopo d4xe5 la torre prende c5, exf6, e si pu� andare avanti con lo scambio di donne. se il cavallo f6 muove d7, c'� comunque la minaccia alfiere d6... se prende di donna si scambiano le donne e poi prendo il cavallo f6, quindi niente per il nero.
-------------------------------------
 ma se il cavallo f6 si ritira in d7 subito dopo d4xe5, le bianche hanno il tempo che gli serve per fare b3-b4, e il gioco � incerto per la colonna d aperta al pedone nero, che oltretutto, se riuscisse ad avanzare (e potrebbe anche essere sacrificato), libererebbe l'alfiere b7, la cui chiusura � il principale vantaggio delle bianche. 
-------------------------------------
 alla fine per� non ho preso di pedone, nonostante sia tematica, per me, perch� comunque � sempre pi� sicuro non aprire la diagonale all'alfiere b7. e c'� sempre ad6...
-------------------------------------
 beh, dopo 22.g3, e4xg3, c'� tutto un mondo. sia se si cambia l'alfiere, sia se si mette subito la torre in g1 e... tattica! alla grande. ci sono duecento trappole per il nero... ma la situazione � delicata per le biache. fantastico. da analizzare. non capisco cosa fa il nero...  questo, che sembra a prima vista un errore, � il "clue" della mia strategia. sacrifico volentieri il pedone g pur di avere la colonna libera per l'attacco sul re nero. anche se questo mette in pericolo diretto il mio re. qui ho calcolato, e direi che � stata una scommessa mica male (soprattutto perch� poi � andata bene). qua il nero comincia a sentire la pressione, perch� la donna � virtualmente l'unico pezzo in gioco, dato che la torre e l'alfiere controllano la presa in d4 da parte del cavallo che potrebbe creare problemi se la torre nera prendesse poi c5.  per quanto mi preferisca come bianco, qui, per�, l'attacco non pu� avanzare direttamente. la debolezza di f3 inchioda l'alfiere e2, e ho provato parecchie varianti sacrificando f3 per vedere se poi la pressione dell'alfiere bianco sostenuto dalla donna su f5 servisse a qualcosa. e mi � sembrato di no.
-------------------------------------
 allora ho detto calma, che comunque anche le nere non hanno grandi possibilit� di attacco. ah, benedetto errore... grazie, grazie, non dovevi... sarificare la torre subito non funzionava, ci ho provato, eccome! beh, insomma, per vincere, un po' d'aiuto dall'opponente non guasta mai... questa utilissima, poi... io temevo un po' cc6, cercando di scambiarmi l'alfiere buono... bella questa sua... contrattacca molto bene di fronte a txf5! devo sempre sorprendere, io... e rischiare. ma lo dico sempre: il re gioca, deve giocare, in posizioni aperte. con prudenza, naturalmente. con questa mossa � di nuovo una minaccia txf5... non sembra, vero? provate. beh, insomma, forse il nero ha pi� risorse di quanto credessi... meglio essere prudenti, la posizione del mio alfiere non potrebbe essere migliore che l�. ok, siamo arrivati al dunque. scambio di donne o scacchetti a iosa, magari qualche pedone va via, ma insomma, il nero sarebbe completamente bloccato (e non credo che riuscirebbe a farmi un perpetuo... anche qui ci ho impiegato del tempo, ma sinceramenete non posso dire di essere sicuro dell'esito). 
-------------------------------------
 allora, dato che si gioca per la gloria, ho voluto fare il sacrificione "colpo di scena"! epatons le burgueoise! non era impossibile per il nero rh7! ricordiamoci che la sua donna campeggia sul mio re... qua, la salvezza del nero era torre per alfiere, qualche mossa prima.  ecco, la scommessa, sin dal sacrificio della torre, era che questo finale fosse vincente per me.  fino qui, tutto � stato calcolato ed � andato come previsto. adesso la minaccia del pedone c bianco dovrebbe se non decidere, almeno permettermi di arrivare ad un finale pi� semplice dove si sentirebbe il mio vantaggio. evidentemente la torre nera non pu� prendere in d4 perch�... ok, questo era il risultato previsto della combinazione. lui non pu� mangiare il pedone d4 perch� perde la torre, infatti... ...dicevo, non pu� prendere in d4 perch�... fino a qui, tutto bene, sacrificio elegante e corretto. dovrei vincere, naturalmente, ma... ci sono errori di distrazione anche nelle partite per corrispondenza. incredibile, ma vero. non me lo chiedete. ore piccole, telefonate, non mi ricordo pi�. non guardate il resto !!!! dovevo abbandonare, ma non si sa mai.  e qui il bianco perde comunque.   
-------------------------------------
  making way for the queen to get to f7. black no doubt took some comfort from removing one of the knights which had caused so much damage. forced! now kc7 allows mate in one with qc8, so again, his move is forced. back again to f7..... again forced. might as well pick up a pawn.....i now left the following conditional sequence, and left a message for my opponent, "conditional moves - 22. … kd8 23. nxb7+ kc8 24. nd6+ kd8 25. qf8+ kd7 26. qc8+ ke7 27. g5." this was enough to make him resign. please leave your comments, and don't forget to rate this annotation!

ett drag som tvingar kamp om centrum, vilket inte är typiskt för sicilianskt spel.
-------------------------------------
 fördelen är alltså att man slår hål på svarts förhoppning att få spela den typiska strategin.
-------------------------------------
 nackdelen är att b-springaren får svårare att komma ut. vanligare är att hålla centrum stängt. nu gav motståndaren mig centrum och min b-springare kan utvecklas normalt. förhindrar löpare g4 motståndaren vill uppenbarligen spela defensivt inledningsvis. om jag har möjlighet utvecklar jag gärna alla pjäser innan jag gör rockad. jag ser inga komplikationer här. bättre drag här för motståndaren är förmodligen b5. tövligt av mig att glömma bort att b-bonden är det enda som skyddar min springare på c3 här förväntade jag mig b4 som svar. jag funderade att det är lättare att attackera hans bönder om de är lösgjorda från varandra. sätter press på a6, skyddar e4 bättre och ger rum åt tornet på f1. och mitt drag förhindrar motståndarens drag exd5 att vara lika effektivt. hotar mitt torn istället för att skydda sin löpare. ett drag jag är stolt att jag såg. om kxh7 så th4+ innan jag tar hans löpare på e7 med damen.
-------------------------------------
 om kh8 så th4 och fortfarande omöjligt att vinna löparen utan att jag får hans löpare också. hans enda möjliga goda drag här gissar jag. en mycket vacker dominans av e-filen. jag måste erkänna att jag var nära att göra bort mig totalt. jag trodde att min löpare kunde ta d6 och tog tag i min löpare före jag såg hur dåligt draget var. som tur är så fanns det ett vettigt ställe att flytta löparen till, som jag enligt reglerna måste flytta på eftersom jag har rört pjäsen. hans bästa svar här är förmodligen att gå 26. db1+ för att vinna ett viktigt tempo i hans pressade situation. mitt svar skulle förmodligen ha varit 27. kh2 ett mycket bra drag från min sida. hotar löpare (vilket tvingar hans dam att hålla kvar skyddet på den) och bonde på d6. märk att draget även sätter press på f7 så att löparen inte kan gå någonstans annat än möjligen g6. bonden på d6 är mao förlorad. min motståndare har här ca 4 minuter kvar på sin klocka och måste göra tre drag till innan han får 30 minuter extra betänketid. själv har jag en hel kvart på mig att göra två drag till. blunder i tidspress från motståndaren. här ger motståndaren upp. efter tvingat drag 28. kh8 följer 29. dg7++

have you ever won a best game prize dear reader? i have, once, with this game, a long, long time ago. as i received it, i was reminded that the late, great john littlewood had not entered any of his games, and if he had, he almost certainly would have won this prize - as well as the prize he won for winning the tournament. i have played andrew j mort since then - i think there is at least one other game with him in my annotations. he is a few years older than me and at the time had a much higher grade.  standard grünfeld defence he plays the exchange variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence#exchange_variation:_4.cxd5_nxd5_5.e4 he grabs the centre. i take. he takes back. i complete the fianchetto https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fianchetto he plays the old main line. for decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with bc4 and ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. it was generally thought that an early nf3 was weak in the exchange variation because it allowed black too much pressure on the centre with ...bg4. in the late 1970s, however, karpov, kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange variation with white, often involving an early rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of black's queenside. another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing be3, qd2, and rc1 or rd1 to fortify white's centre, remove white's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by white.  vladimir kramnik and boris gelfand are the leading practitioners as white, and ľubomír ftáčnik has had many fine results with the black pieces i castle. he continues with his plan. i strike at the centre. he castles.  i develop my knight, attacking d4 for the 4th time. and he protects it. one of the 3 variations in the grünfeld defence that is names after vasily smyslov, world chess champion from 1957 to 1958. however this move has rather been put out of fashion by 11. rc1 rd8 12. bf4! so nowadays more common is an older line bg4 11.f3 na5 12.bxf7+ he develops his rook. i develop mine. he starts his king's side attack. i pin his knight on e2. he continues with his king's side advance. i attack his bishop, daring him to take on f7. later i did have a game which continued with 14.	bxf7+	kxf7 15.	fxg6+	kxg6, the point being 16. nf4+ can be met with qxf4! but he played a more sensible move. this move is a mistake, i was rather hoping for 15.	bc4	na5 16.	bd3	nc6 and draw agreed. but he plays this. i take back. attacking f7 protecting. attacking my rook. find black's next move. would you have played this? i felt it was best and still do! fritz agrees! he takes the rook. i take back. he takes back. at the time i thought it was a mistake as i win back the exchange and end up a pawn up. i thought it was better for him just to lose the second pawn so i end up with bishop and two pawns for the rook. however my version of fritz seems to think it is the best move. at the time i thought this was clearly best, winning back the exchange, but fritz tells me nxd4 was better. the king moves out of the way. bishop moves in, attacking the rook on c1 and discovering an attack on the queen. so the queen moves. all those years ago i gave myself an exclamation mark for this move. i am not sure why. fritz prefer the immediate bxrc1 he takes back. as fritz points out, it is better to recapture with the queen. can you see why dear reader? i take the rook. as fritz points out it would have been more accurate to first play 22.....rd2! which more or less forces 23. qc4 and then 23....rd4! and after the queen moves, capture the rook on c1 and black has improved the position of his rook. he takes back. i am just a clear pawn up here.  attacking a2. not really bad, but fritz prefers rd4 attacking f7. protecting f7. protecting a2. offering a queen swap.  his queen drops back. offering another queen swap. avoiding the exchange. again, offering the exchange. bc4 and e4 are threatened too. so this is forced.  again threatening the exchange of queens. fritz prefers qe3. he avoids again. i offer the exchange again. fritz prefers ne5 he finally allows the exchange of queens. so i take. he takes back. i attack e4 he takes. i take back. he attacks c6 but he can't take it right away as 34. rxc6?? re1# so he prevents back rank mates. 2 clear pawns up now! he takes. i take. king comes up for the endgame passed pawns must be pushed! king comes round again. pawn forward again. rook behind!  onward christian soldiers! king thinks about coming across. he was running short of time by now. i make way for the pawn to advance again. he now realises that he can't come across. so i advance again. he shuffles his pawn my king comes up. he sorts of wastes a move. and i stay near his king. i have an easy winning plan of driving his king to the f file and then playing rf1+ followed by a2-a1=q white resigned. thank you for reading. please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two. until next time, dear reader! 
-------------------------------------
these moves were compulsory. as opposed to 4. …nf6, which is more common.  actually, the first four or five moves of the sicilian are so malleable and interchangeable, each often leading to a known, studied line, that the order of these moves is secondary to the ideas.  this particular position is known as the taimanov variation.  in this system, black often hopes to place a bishop on b4 or c5.  many interesting and complex positions can be reached from this position, including a form of the hedgehog, the maroczy bind, and the kasparov gambit. a natural developing move, but with a latent threat.  what would love to, at some point, get a knight to d6, which is arguably the most powerful square that he can sit on.  the permanent weaknesses incurred at d5 and d6 for black have to be dealt with, and much time and effort has been spent finding the best methods for which he can do so.  one drawback of the taimanov variation is by moving the e-pawn, black has created a permanent hole at d6.  white would do well to try to exploit it.  a knight on c3 is a mere two moves away from the lethal square, and of course, many other factors will have to be in place if the white player hopes to properly use the square to its devastating potential, but the lack of pawn protection leaves the idea permanently in both players minds. black creates a tight little pawn barrier in the center.  what it restricts in space, it adds to defense, and given the weakness at d6, it makes sense to occupy it with a pawn as second best to being defended by one.  an aggressive move to be sure, but not completely debilitating.  the weaknesses incurred at f3 and especially f4 are believed to be not life threatening with proper play.  but, as we’ll see, polgar was able to exploit the weakness.  if a player of shirov’s strength is unable to defend the weaknesses, perhaps the move itself should be considered suspect.  it hardly speaks well of the line if your only hope is that your opponent misplays. an innocuous looking move, but with deep theory behind it.  an early a6 is a common theme in many lines of the sicilian.  the b5 square is inherently weakened due to black’s first move and a6 seeks to both defend it, and prepare b7-b5, as this often makes white’s knights uncomfortable.  black must be careful not to over extend here, but a7-a6 can hardly be considered doing so.  the prophylactic nature of the move, combined with its subtle power, make it a common choice at the grandmaster level.    shirov brings out the bishop to its best square.  bf4, aside from prohibiting an f2-f4 advance, gives black the opportunity to play e6-e5, forking the knight and bishop.  this also lends support to the d4 square, which is the weakness white must with for the entire game. polgar chooses the superior knight development move, instead of nf6.  nf6 is all well and good, it develops, it helps clear the way for a ks castle, and it attacks the g-pawn, but it allows the following line: [9.  nxc6 bxc6 (now any hopes for b7-b5 are gone, and black’s pawn on a6 isn’t doing as stellar of a job as it was before) 10. g6! (and black is on her heels.  she loses a tempo, and good, central spots for her knights are quickly disappearing) 10. …nd7 11. qd2 a5 12. f4! (now white is exerting incredible pressure on the ks.  the f4 weakness has been successfully nullified, and the ks pawns are storming.  perhaps this is what shirov had in mind with his 6th move?  oh, to be able to calculate like that over the board…)] .  nge7 accomplishes nearly the same thing as nf6, but without conceding a tempo when white plays g6.  also, the move contests f5, which is going to be black’s key breakthrough. shirov sees the impending b7-b5 break, and takes steps to limit the power of it.  although one can argue that reacting to a move that hasn’t happened yet gives your opponent the upper hand, i don’t believe that is the case here.  shirov probably reasons b7-b5 is going to happen regardless, so taking a turn to move the knight will also have to happen, and whether it happens on move 9 or move 10 is irrelevant. the inevitable consequence of a6 in the sicilian.  this move has yet to find an absolute refutation, and until it does, i’m sure black will keep using it as a potent weapon. shirov thrusts forward and creates an intimidating looking pawn wall, but as is often the case with pawn moves, their committal nature comes back to haunt them.  the f4 thrust fatally weakened g4.  now, rather than having a dominating pawn wall along e4-f4-g4, white has a debilitating weakness along the squares e3-f3-g3, and also the weakness extends to e4 and f4, which can no longer be defended by pawns. calmly and efficiently, polgar applies additional pressure to the e4 square, in preparation for the onslaught. as if he senses the impending break, shirov sends his queen in to defend all three pawns.  the fact that this is necessary goes to show how weak these squares have become. most annotations give this a double exclamation point, even by grandmasters who are reluctant to do so.  polgar sacrifices a pawn, but in return she nullifies the strongest point in white’s position.   the queen, who had been shielded behind the pawn wall is now uncomfortably open.  white is now forced to put his attacking plans on hold as he cleans up the mess that has ensued. shirov has little choice but to accept the sacrifice as after 12 f5 ne5, black has permanent control of f4 and e5.  the counter-attacking 12. e5 is a slightly more edible, but still leaves the ugly holes across d4, e4, and f4, as well as an isolated e-pawn after the captures.  shirov’s best chance was to ignore the threat with o-o-o, and start a more strategic counter attack, putting pressure on the e-file.  it would be hard to do so when so much time and material are invested on the ks, to simply ignore it. the knight gladly accepts the square left unguarded by the pawn capture the queen is now purely on defensive duties, and shirov puts her on the square where she can guard both the e- and d- pawns.  shirov is undoubtedly shaken at this point, much like ivan drago was when rocky first cut him. polgar has seen deeply into this position and deems it necessary to constrict shirov’s position even more.  on the surface, it may seem like it takes time out of her attack for a seemingly pointless move.  the knight can easily be moved, and most of the energy has been focused on the ks at this point, but it’s where the knight has to move to that polgar is interested in. shirov is forced to move the knight, and feels that it’s better to add to the defenders on the ks.  na4 gets the knight out of danger, but a4 is a wretched square for him.  nb1 is not as bad, but it cuts the rook off from the fight.  the drawback of ne2 is that it constricts the king, as we’ll see in a few moves polgar finishes the combo with a right cross.  this removes the only defender of the f5 square (the pawn on e4 is pinned by the bishop).  the knight on e2’s restrictment of the king is becoming palpable unattractive is gxf6 because after bxf6, black’s bishop is joining the fray. polgar sends her other knight into the donnybrook.  they are nearly untouchable as white’s g- and h-pawns are too far advanced, and the e-pawn is pinned.  overall, this is a very uncomfortable position for shirov. this is almost forced as the bishop is undefended. polgar brings out the big guns to add to the already lethal pressure in the ks. this is the move that essentially loses for white.  the logic behind it is straightforward, to drive the bishop from the a8-h1 diagonal, but shirov has over looked a devastating move at black’s disposal.  in his book “chess: the art of logical thinking,” neil mcdonald says that a mating attack with two knights is so rare in grandmaster play that it’s excusable that shirov missed this move.  the queen is untouchable because of 17. qxg5 nf3#.   this type of mate is virtually never seen, so it's quite impressive that polgar was able to create one.  also, the knight attacks f2, and it will fork the king and rook if it gets there.  for shirov, it's a case of losing his queen, his rook, or being mated.  not a comfortable position for anyone to be in. seeking to minimize the damage.  shirov forks both knights, but the threat is completely benign. polgar decides that the queens are not needed and she is happy to remove white's most powerful piece. capturing with the bishop leads to the horrific 18 ...bxe4 19 kf2 n3g4+ 20 ke1 bxh1, and recapturing with the h-pawn let's black mate on the next move with nf3#.  the knight clears space for the king as well. polgar succeeds in pulling off a trick amateurs often fall for. seeking to trap the knight after it takes the rook, but polgar has a plan for that too! shirov is finally able to dispose of the fire-breathing bishop. polgar succeeds in saving her knight, and will come out of this comfortably up the exchange. if he can't capture the knight, he might as well chase it off, and activate his king.  the shirov is no doubt dreading the endgame that will follow, but he's prepared to go down with a fight. another option here was 22 ...ng4 and after [23 bg1 nc5 24 nxc5 dxc5 [24 ...rc8? (25 bxa6 rc7 26 bb4+, and white has successfully equalized] 25 be2 rg8!, black has a strong attack on the ks.  alternatively, if 23 bb6 nc5 24 nxc5 dxc5, black has a dangerous, albeit isolated, passed pawn, but it has the support of the knight on g4 (after ne5), the rook on a8 (after rc8), and the bishop on f8.]  the position reached in the game is nearly identical, only with the white bishop on f2 instead of b6 the other option was to take with the bishop, but shirov correctly decides that keeping the bishop pair is one of the few advantages he has in this position. shirov looks to get his bishop to c3, pinning the knight to the rook. before allowing that to happen, polgar removes the knight before he becomes tied down. a nifty little maneuver by polgar, blocking the rook, but now it can no longer be taken because it is defended. inadvisable was 26 bxd4 because of 26 ...cxd4!, and the value of the passed pawn increased by being off the c-file. it took until move 26 for polgar to bring her last minor piece out, but when your opponent gives you the opportunity to use your knights in such an effective manner as shirov allowed polgar, it's forgivable. an excellent tactical idea.  28 e5! will give black serious problems.  fortunately for her though, polgar found an adquate response. an excellent tactical idea.  28 e5! will give black serious problems.  fortunately for her though, polgar found an adequate response. following the adage of “restrain...blockade...destroy,” shirov blocks the advance of the c-pawn. bringing her king into the fight and connecting rooks.  if one move gives you the opportunity to achieve two objectives, it might to well to make it. shirov tries to tie the rook down to the defense of the a-pawn, and perhaps has ideas of ra5. white resigns here because [30 kxc5 rac8 31 rxa6 nb8+, and the rook is lost.] 
-------------------------------------

quite a good square for the bishop, better than c4 it seems to me. pity about that missing pawn ... i suppose there are a few other moves that can be tried, although it will be difficult to mould them into some kind of independent development plan. i propose that 6.bg5 be simply answered by 6...bf5 with a likely transposition to earlier lines: 7.bc4 e6 8.0-0 be7.  6.bf4 is a decent enough move but with white a pawn down that is simply not enough! 6...bf5 7.bd3 bxd3 8.qxd3 e6 9.0-0 nbd7 10.rae1 be7 is one of many possible continuations. white has scant compensation for a pawn. 6.ne5 looks more dangerous than it is. 6...bf5 7.qf3 e6 is much the same. i reckon simple development will do for black: ...bf5, ...e6, ...nbd7, ...be7 is the plan and then black decides on where to move his queen (usually c7 or b6) and then on which side to castle. if this sounds simplistic i suggest you withhold your skepticism and give it a try!   after 7.h3 bxf3 8.qxf3 qxd4 9.be3 qd8 10.0-0-0 nbd7 11.rhf1 e6 white has very little to bite on. one icc game, taken from sawyer's book continued 12.g4 ne5 13.qf2 qc7 14.g5 nd5 15.nxd5 cxd5 16.bb5+ nc6 17.bf4 qb6 when white was two pawns down for nothing. icc games should be taken with a pinch of salt but has white got that many options after 8...qxd4? hardly.  7.0-0 e6 is the same type of game. neither 8.h3 bxf3 9.qxf3 qxd4+ 10.be3 qe5! 11.bf4 qa5 12.ne4 nbd7, or 8.bg5 bxf3 9.qxf3 qxd4+ 10.kh1 nbd7 gives white enough for his two pawn deficit.   or 8...bd6 9.qe1 nbd7 10.a3 qc7 11.h3 white's last two moves are a joke - he just doesn't know what to do! 11...bg3 12.bf2 bxf2+ 13.qxf2 bxf3 14.qxf3 qb6 15.qe3 0-0 16.na4 qa5 17.nc5 nxc5 18.dxc5 nd7 19.b4 (19.bxh7+ kxh7 20.qd3+ kg8 21.qxd7 qxc5+ 22.kh1 qxc2 is easy for black) 19...qc7 20.rae1 rae8 21.rf3 f6 22.qe4 g6 23.rfe3 ne5 24.bc4 kg7 25.rd1 re7 26.rd6 rd8?!

the king's indian defence. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king's_indian_defence i play the sämisch variation. it is named after friedrich sämisch, who developed the system in the 1920s. this often leads to very sharp play with the players castling on opposite wings and attacking each other's kings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king's_indian_defence#s.c3.a4misch_variation:_5.f3 this is all commonly seen. i now come up with a move which is questionable. correct is nge2 or qd2. i am threatening to take on c6 followed by d6. he meets this threat, with his own threat to c4 not a good square to put my queen! closing up the centre. i develop he prepares f7-f5 i hit his knight. i was quite expecting a pawn sac now, nf4 and after 13. nxf4, exf4 14. bxf4 he has compensation for the pawn. this just wastes time. i felt confident with my position again. preparing kingside attack while he prepares ....b7-b5 i finally commit my king. further preparations for b7-b5 while i mobilise on my eastern front..... (the kingside!). the blocked pawn centre does rather divide the board into 2 halves. so he makes the final preparation for b7-b5 now that he has removed the attack on c4, i can mobilise my queen. so he starts his queenside push and i just ignore the attack on c4 and just get on with my attack rather than take, he moves his knight forward again. and i throw the knight in. of course he dares not take the knight with his g pawn, i simply take back with my g pawn and there is disaster down the g file. but i am giving up the pawn on c4, and the question is - is this pawn sac sound? although i won, maybe it not sound. what do you think dear reader? so he takes, attacking my queen. i want to stay on my bishop so that i can reply to bxh6 with qxh6. for instance 19. qg2? bxh6+ 20. nxh6 kg7 and white's attack seems to be grinding to a halt. he virtually has to take this way. i open the g file. ok stop and find white's next move! did you get this? ok, what did white play next? did you find this? rxg7 instead wins for black! and now white plays? bxe5 is mate too. so it was great to go back to the top of the "player of the season" for division 2 of the chester & district chess league. http://cdchessleague.org.uk/players.php?comp=division+2 but the question remains. was my pawn sac sound? what if instead of nh5? which loses for him (in the best lines he is bishop for pawn down in the ending, maybe instead he should play ne8. then what? maybe someone would set this up on a computer for me, and see its evaluation of the position? anyway, many thanks for reading, please rank this annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two! until next time dear reader!

this is a fairly standard - the exchange variation of the grünfeld defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence#exchange_variation:_4.cxd5_nxd5_5.e4 white's move order though is slightly strange - i played 9. 0-0 instead of 9. be3 to avoid black exchanging pawns on d4 and then throwing in a queen check on a5. black's next is an attempt to take advantage of this.  although this move is the third most popular, according to the world database on gameknot, - after nc6 and cxd4 - it also scores the best. black now threatens to take on d4, discovering an attack on the bc4.  10. bf4 e5 11. bxe5 bxe5 12. dxe5 qxe5 13. bd5 seems to be the best way forward for white. the obvious way to continue. keeping the nd7 out of e5. bf4 or rb1 has been played in this position previously.  so the knight comes out this way instead. bishop drops back. threat - 13...bg7xc3 white protects. black develops white asks the question. he takes. i was rather expecting him to retreat of c8, but this seems adequate. i take back. he hits the bishop. it drops back. he throws in a check. considering what happens later, maybe kh2 was better. he attacks c3. i protect. now 18....na4 is met with ba3 with complications. so now he is threatening na4 which i prevent. he doubles on the d file. this was probably a mistake. by over-protecting c3, i release the bb2 and/or the qe3 for other duties. he nibbles at my centre. i take. he takes back. i shut out his bishop. he advances i challenge he takes i take back. he attacks my rook. rook drops back. he attacks my queen. i threaten 27. bxg6 with complications. which he avoids. so i play this. he takes i take back. he attacks i defend. he takes. he is now threatening rxf5 and if i recapture, qd1+ is winning for him. so i move my king. queen comes back to protect his king-side so my bishop heads towards the new war-zone. by breaking the pin, black is now threatening to take on f5. but now if he takes, he gets mated. i now lay a trap which he falls into. he sees the chance to take my queen. he falls into the trap. 33.....rf6 is correct and good. i take his rook. he takes my queen with check.  i take back. he has to play this to stop my pawn queening. i block. he takes. right, white to play and win! a blunder! 37. bg4 was the only way to win. now the pin stops the mate on f8. threatening mate again. but now there is no mate. a final blunder in a lost position. oops! white resigns. 
-------------------------------------
so it starts out as a grünfeld defence, named after ernst franz grünfeld (november 21, 1893 – april 3, 1962). for more about this defence visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c3%bcnfeld_defence my young opponent opts for the exchange variation. now white has an imposing looking centre the exchange of knights strengthens the white centre still further. black generally attacks white's centre with ...c5 and ...bg7, often followed by moves such as ...qa5, ...cxd4, ...bg4, and ...nc6. white often uses his big centre to launch an attack against black's king.  reuben fine in "the ideas behind the chess openings" 1943 thought that black had to play an immediate 6.....c7-c5 as otherwise white can play 7. ba3. however it was later pointed out that black can play nd7 to prepare c7-c5, if necessary sacrificing a pawn, and so black need not fear 7. ba3, so i prefer to to play bg7 and 0-0 first and avoid variations where white may throw in bb5+ - not that black need fear this move either, but i haven't learned about it! white can develop his pieces in a number of ways in the exchange variation. for decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with bc4 and ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. it was generally thought that an early nf3 was weak in the exchange variation because it allowed black too much pressure on the centre with ...bg4. in the late 1970s, however, karpov, kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange variation with white, often involving an early rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of black's queenside. another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing be3, qd2, and rc1 or rd1 to fortify white's centre, remove white's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by white. playing 7. be3 keeps white's options open. according to plan. ruling out the old main line of bc4 and ne2. so i do the thematic push. moving his rook off the a1-h8 diagonal, i was rather afraid of him playing d4-d5 followed by c3-c4 at some stage, which is why i did the following exchange. now taking with knight or bishop leaves his pawn on c3 very weak - it is isolated and exposed to attack along the diagonal and the file. so this recapture is virtually forced. indirectly attacking d4. if i were to take on f3 now, if he took back with the queen i could take on d4. so he prevents that. now i decided that i had better check on a5 now, otherwise he will castle and then it is not check. so i threw in the check. otherwise he loses the a2 pawn. so i take. he takes back. because of his better development and strong centre white has an edge in this position, but i correctly guessed that my young opponent had yet to master the grand-master skills of grinding out a win in endings like this! so i develop. he attacks my knight. i pin the pawn. i found out afterwards that this position had been seen before! 15.	ke1 was played in dziadyk, pavel (2198) vs. karnaukh, anato… (2277) with white winning in 69 moves. 15. rhd1 e6 was played in koen, maja (2195) vs. genova, ruzka (2175) which ended in a draw in 24 moves after ke1 and grabliauskas vi… (2433) vs. makovskis georg… (2250) which ended in a win for white in 36 moves after 17. ng5. my young opponent tries another move.  he attacks my bishop. so i take. he takes back. i contest the c file. he unpins his pawn. i throw in the check. going into an opposite coloured bishop ending makes it even more drawish.  i take back. he hits my rook. i advance it. he takes. i take back. he attacks my bishop. i protect it. and he offers a draw which i willingly accept. many thanks for reading. please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader!

a40 queen's pawn opening. the queen's pawn opening move is somewhat slower than the popular e4, because white will not be able to castle for three more moves. its advantage is that it gives white more control over tactical surprises and often provides more lasting initiative and pressure.  a45 indian defense. the immediate development of the knight is the most supple response to the queen's pawn opening, allowing transposition into virtually every type of defense at black's disposal.  a45 indian defense. by blocking the c-pawn, white forces the game out of normal queen-pawn opening lines. transposition to the french defense is now possible, or white may intend the blackmar-diemer gambit.  out of opening book. d5 would have been in the indian defense opening line. §˜ž¯³¹¨ ƒÿƒÿƒÿÿ ˜ÿ  ÿ – ýÿýýÿýÿ ¦ª²›–¤   b07 pirc defense / pirc defense 1.e4 d6 2.d4 nf6 (transposed).  b07 pirc defense / classical variation. in the classical variation, white is content to develop as in a king's indian, without c4.  b08 pirc defense / classical variation / two knights system.  b07 pirc defense / pirc defense 1.e4 d6 2.d4 nf6 (transposed).  b07 pirc defense / pirc defense 1.e4 d6 2.d4 nf6.  b07 pirc defense / pirc defense 1.e4 d6 2.d4 nf6.  out of opening book. c6 would have been in the pirc defense / pirc defense 1.e4 d6 2.d4 nf6 opening line.   slightly better is bb7.  slightly better is e5.  black wins a pawn for a pawn. material is even.  blocks black's pawn at c5.  pins white's pawn at c2.  forks black's bishop at e4 and black's rook at a8 and blocks black's pawn at d6.  frees black's pawn at f7 from the pin, protects black's rook at a8, and attacks white's pawn at a2.  pins black's pawn at f7, protects white's pawn at a2, threatens black's rook at a8, and blocks black's pawn at d6. black wins a bishop, a knight, and a pawn for a bishop and a knight. black is ahead by a pawn in material.  removes the threat on black's rook at a8.  attacks white's queen.  moves it to safety.  protects black's pawn at c5.  slightly better is qc7.  slightly better is qb5.  slightly better is e4.  checks black's king and isolates black's pawn at c5. white wins a pawn. material is even.  slightly better is qxd5.  leads to 21...nxb2 22.rxd8 nxc4 23.rd7 e4 24.nd2 nxe3 25.fxe3 f5 26.nc4 rfd8 27.rxa7 bxc3, which wins a queen, a knight, and a pawn for a queen, a bishop, and a pawn. better is qb7, leading to 21...rc7 22.qb3 qe8 23.rd6 nb6 24.rfd1 qf7 25.qxf7 rfxf7, which wins a queen for a queen.  slightly better is nxb2.  removes the threat on white's pawn at b2.  attacks white's knight.  moves it to safety.  hangs the pawn at b2. leads to 24...nxb2 25.rb1 nd3 26.f3 c4 27.rb7 rc7 28.rxc7 qxc7 29.fxe4 re8 30.be3 rxe4, which wins a rook and a pawn for a rook and a pawn. better is bf4, leading to 24...nb6 25.a3 qa4 26.rfe1 rfd8 27.bg5 rd7 28.nf1, which results in no captures.  leads to 25.bg5 be5 26.rd2 qc7 27.f4 bf6 28.bxf6+ rxf6 29.qf2 rd6 30.rxd6 qxd6, which wins a bishop for a rook and a bishop. better is nxb2, leading to 25.rb1 nd3 26.f3 c4 27.rb7 rc7 28.rxc7 qxc7 29.fxe4 re8 30.be3 rxe4, which wins a rook and two pawns for a rook and a pawn.  protects white's pawn at b2 and blocks black's pawn at e4.  attacks white's pawn at a2.  threatens black's queen.  protects black's queen. black wins a bishop for a knight. material is even.  removes the threat on white's pawn at a2.  seizes the open file.  pins white's pawn at f2.  partially pins black's rook at e8 and threatens black's rook at e8.  frees black's rook from the pin and removes the threat on black's rook. black wins a rook for a rook. material is even.  pins white's pawn at f2.  slightly better is rd8.  takes control of the open file.  blocks black's pawn at e4.  slightly better is g5.  protects white's knight, threatens black's rook, and isolates black's pawn at e4. white wins a pawn.  yikes!

-------------------------------------
the starting point of the accelerated dragon. i opt for a maróczy bind, which takes control of the d5 square and pretty much prevents the d7-d5 move that black hopes for in the accelerated dragon. this all seems normal up to now. i do not think this was a wise move, trading the g7 bishop with that kind of pawn formation can be detrimental to king safety. i guess i did this to prevent any surprise forks/double attacks with check, maybe i was thinking of a possible pawn storm. getting my queen into an aggressive square. i like my position up until now. planning to double rooks on this file and control the center. not sure what this was for. i guess nh5 was to prepare this move. preventing a discovered attack which would end up in the loss of my queen. and i'm a pawn ahead. i like my position to be honest. a pawn ahead, my rook is on an open (central) file, my queen is on an aggressive square, and my king is safe. offers the rook for control of the file. here, i have several options. i can retreat my queen to d2, i can place my other rook on the same file and put some use to it, and i can trade rooks in order to simplify since i'm ahead in material. i like retreating my queen to d2 or placing the other rook on the same file the best. trading rooks here might seem to favor the side that's ahead on material, but i think that giving him that open file might be a bad idea. so i chose c5. let me explain. i defend my rook, while at the same time opening the possibility for my e2 bishop to check his king and put him in a precarious position. what i failed to notice is that i cannot actually check his king since his queen would take my bishop, and that i've just given the pawn back due to a tactic. but if he took the pawn back, i'd be able to get my bishop where i had planned. and here's the tactic. this is what i had planned, but now what? i did this to try to place my rook on e6 after and possibly distract the queen from it's defence of f8. he attacks my bishop. i retreat to a safe square. this is a blunder. how do i capitalize? there we go. he can't take the rook because he'd get mated in 1 by way of qxf8, so now he must move to a square where he defends the rook on f8. there's only two options. qd6 and qb4. he chose qd6. and i chose to blunder right back, with the idea of sending my knight to g5 afterwards and attacking his king. the problem is that i had a move that would win a piece, attack his king, and kept my king pretty safe. i should have followed up the first brilliant tactic with another brilliant tactic. i should have played 28. rxh5. the g pawn was pinned to the queen, so he couldn't take the rook unless he wanted to lose the queen. and his queen was defending the f8 rook, so even if he checked me, he would have had to find a way for him to defend both the mate on h7 and the mate on qxf8 after the check, and even if he could, i would be a piece ahead. i think 28. rxh5 would have won instantly. and now will follow a myriad of checks until he wins a pawn and gets tired of checking my king. wins the pawn and now is a pawn up. and now i do not like my king safety.  i looked at this move a bit too late, and a bit erroneously as well. i thought he couldn't take the rook because of qf6#, but he surprised me with another check which defended the f6 square and allowed him to win the exchange. this was starting to look quite grim for me. i take the f pawn since doubled pawns are easier to attack. i was thinking that i could still pull a victory out somehow, but the next move was pretty forcing. i believe i was forced to do this, or else i'd lose a lot of material, or get checkmated, or get into a really uncomfortable position after 39. qe3. so i chose to trade queens, hoping that his doubled pawns on the h file will be a target and i'll find a way to draw the game. protects his pawn. i was planning some weird knight moves to win the h4 pawn. maybe i should have focused more on advancing my kingside pawn majority. now he began to get his queenside pawns rolling. attacking the bishop. only 3 more knight moves away from attacking the h4 pawn. might have been a bit too hopeful for that. forgetting that his queenside pawn majority could be my downfall. trying to get my king involved. i'm not sure that this was the right way to proceed. maybe i could have played a4. suggestions? i can't go up as i'd like to because of rd3+, winning my bishop, and the game. he goes to d3 anyway, only in this case i don't lose a piece. preparing an advance to b3. preventing the immediate advance. finally bringing his king out of inactivity. perhaps i should have tried g3 here. this move allows the advance of the pawn after a useful check on e3. if kf2 i lose a piece, if kd2 i lose the g pawn. saving the bishop and limiting the rook's movement. i suppose he wanted to move his king without losing that pawn. i finally play g3, not sure if it was too late. his king is getting closer. trying to get my king involved somehow. and this is the final, decisive blunder. try to find the next move for black. i should have played kd2, but maybe that would have lost as well. and here it is clear that i cannot win. the next few moves i played quickly and without much thought. and i surrendered. his king was going to g4 next, winning my final two pawns, and relinquishing all my hopes.

first move for the sicilian defense. stopping him from taking e5. challenging him on c5. took his pawn to capture control of the center. reinforcing e4. reinforcing d4 and blocking moves on his king-side. reinforcing e5 with the pawn. super reinforcing all my pieces (c3, d4, e3, g2) took his knight since he was trying to take back the center, which he won't.  he tried to take my queen, but that isn't going to happen. pushing for his king's pawn at f7, but not really. just trying to put the pressure on him. trying to keep queen-side open, hoping he will move his bishop to give me room to try and checkmate. i am hoping he moves his queen with all this pressure i am putting on his side. getting rid of his pieces. he doesn't need them right? :p castled. making a move to reinforce my position on his side at b6. protected my bishop on b6. he now sees what i am doing and is trying to stop me. first check of the game. (he is bending to the pressure. ) second check. he can't seem to stand the dragon variation at all.  trying to capture his rook. he made a big mistake, letting me get a second queen. of course he took it because he realized he messed up. challenging his queen. third check of the game. fourth check. he messed up again, taking his queen. getting a third queen of the game. my win is inevitable now. fifth check. boxing him in. checkmate!   the sicilian defense is the most popular defense for black against the e4 push from white. the dragon variation is the most aggressive and sharpest line that black has in the sicilian defense. white has many options that he can respond with. the most common is the yugoslav attack but this is a double edge sword. white will castle on the queen side, black will castle on the king side and both will have very sharp options to attack their opponents king. this is one of magnus carlsen’s favorite lines and has had much success playing as black, opening up the defense white has on the queen side. some of the other options white has are the classical variation, the levenfish and the harrington-glek. my personally favorite line is the levenfish. with the idea in mind to attack the king side of black, white makes an early aggressive push with his f pawn to f4. this poses many problems for black and is forced to mix up his normal developement to defend the e pawn from white pushing forward. there are so many exciting lines in the dragon variation of the sicilian defense, it is a must study for any chess player.  i highly recommend using this at any level of chess play. but do be cautious as it is very hard to use, and one wrong move and you're giving the game away. 
-------------------------------------
this move is usual, but i dont like. i dont know why i did it (it could be due to the gameknot opening book) i didnt know this move was an error i thought "i will lost a pawn but it doesnt matter, because that pawn is a burden (i dont know if it´s the correct translation for 'lastre'). i prefer to open the d-column for a counterattack in the queen side (if i could do it)" why is this move correct?. for me was an error ok, we both have same value of pieces, but for me i have more value because i had lost a pawn anyway now i have other plan:change pieces and keep my rook (more powerful than a bishop or knight) for the end of the game strong knight out white with no rooks and open column, i thought at that moment i had advantage one pawn you, one pawn me obvious, with less pieces, i have advantage for the power of my rook (as i said) same value, but my rook have the power and the king is prisoner  for keep the white king with less room the king is in the battle this was an error.  and the rook is better than the bishop other pawn is mine :-) this move has no hope... another one... :-) here the game was over for me and the way for h-pawn (or even f-pawn) is almost clear
-------------------------------------
sicilian wing gambit that stalhandske showed me. the first time i use it. developping i found this aggressive and strange move in the database. as i'm experimenting, i'll try it. gambit black has little reason not to take. to fire the black knight and devellop menacing white's central pawn. logical move. attacking white's center trading only available move i saw pinning the knight, knowing that the brave lancelot won't sacrify his true love and queen. to fire the evil bishop lancelot dies. now that there is no more black lsb, i estimatte that it's not a bad place for the queen. challenging the d soldier. the archer counterattacks with a mating menace. to prevent 13. qf7+ mate so that king arthur can hide in his castle. black wins another pawn but his king his naked and white has plenty of attacking possibilities (it seems to be the advantage of this gambit). "send the war machines against the ennemy king" ... who hides behind his wife. black is in trouble and his d pawn is almost pinned. preventing 16. re8 ... so that white attacks her black majesty ... who prudently hides developping and pressing time to liquidate black's central heroïcal soldier. if 18. ... qxd4 19. rd1 if 18. ... nxd4 19. qxb7 with mating menace. carrying on the pressing. forced move black has only one move. forced move but i do not see how to carry on. pressing developping finally, black manages to develop. most of his troops are regrouped in the corner but i do not see ho to carry on attacking, so that i decide to call for reserves. perceval saddle his warhorse and rides to the battle. huh huh ! very good move. i had a lot of difficulties to find this move. i tried many other lines but they were all bad for white. "my king, we lost our archering company but our position still gives us an advantage" " carry on, brave soldiers but be carefull now." protecting the d pawn so that black cannot settle on the center. probably to prevent d5 but it doesn't seem a great move. menacing check "à découverte" with mate to follow. black has little other choice. mating menace. only move. the black king will have to flee near the right edge where he'll be trapped. no choice beginning of the mating sequence black brings reinforcement. forced mate in 6 another possibility was 29. ... kg5 30. qg7+ with mating sequence to follow (white has to bring his knight on e4) black has no choice. if 30. ... hxg6 31. qxg6+mate from now on, all of black's moves are forced. the black king goes back on g5 forced black has only one move. forced rook sacrifice mate.

-------------------------------------
mira que cuartas, antes de empezar advirtió a todos en su catalán de cali: "posin les peces on no les pugui menjar", y voy yo y no le hago caso. tras la salida habitual del peón de rey, intenté quitar su peón ofreciéndole el sacrificio del peón del álfil que posteriormente podría recuperar comiendo con el álfil de reina... ésta, desde luego, no es una salida estándar y por ejemplo, en esta página de salidas no está contemplada: http://www.eudesign.com/chessops/epin-01b.htm ... y pronto supe por qué. mi siguiente movimiento iba a ser d5, avanzar el peón de reina para liberar el álfil y amenazar el peón blanco... pero me di cuenta que si cuartas sacaba la reina para hacerme jaque ( 2. d5 qh5+ ), esta situación me iba a dejar muy descolocado el flanco de rey, pues a 3. g6 seguiría 3. ... fxg6, perdiendo otro peón. así que decidí evitar la situación del jaque con 2. kf6 ... lo cuál iba a ser el final de la partida como veréis a continuación. aquí ya empecé a ver que se me estaba complicando el flanco de rey. aún así seguí con mis planes iniciales y adelante el peón de reina, dejando una posible salida al rey y liberando el álfil de dama. primer problema serio. si le como el álfil con el caballo  4. ... hxh5  5. qxh5+ g7  6. fxg7 y volvemos al mismo problema de antes, el flanco del rey hecho trizas. así que decidí la otra opción posible que era mover el rey, pese a perder el enroque. tras jugar cuartas 5. d4, pensé que ya se había recuperado el pulso de una partida normal y que pese a tener el rey descolocado podría recuperarme. mis planes eran abrir un hueco en el flanco de dama, por donde sacar el álfil y poder meter el rey a buen recaudo, dejando salida para la torre por la línea de fondo... vamos, un enroque en 3 tiempos... pero el rey nunca llegaría a su destino. el peón blanco de d4 era un dardo envenenado. aquí ya vi lo que se proponía cuartas... mierda! ese caballo acabaría llegando tras el jaque a f7 amenazándome doblemente a dama y torre. quizás lo mejor hubiera sido jugar hc6 y si subía el caballo cambiarlo, pero en una desafortunada decisión decidí mover el rey a d6 para evitar que el caballo blanco me hiciera jaque... luego ya movería la dama para evitar la doble amenaza en f7 horror!!!! qué he hecho! le he puesto en bandeja una triple jaque a la reina, al rey y a la torre... lo que es peor, la reina no puedo moverla, el rey tampoco... en esta jugada decidí acojerme al único pasa palabra que podía hacerse. cuartas me dijo: "uy, parece que vas a perder una reina", juas, como si tuviera más. después de una vuelta de reflexión, encontré lo que cuartas calificó como: "parece que has encontrado la única solución del problema"...  como mal menor, pensé que sería mejor comer el peón y perder una torre en la siguiente jugada, pero cuartas ya había olido la sangre y no se contentaba con ir comiendo piezas... y el puto peón de d4 dando cobertura a ese caballo. para evitar de nuevo el triple jaque no quedaba más remedio que comer con el caballo ese álfil. buah! dama por álfil, jaque y mi única respuesta posible conducía al triple jaque!!! era momento de abandonar, pero tras echar un vistazo al resto de mesas pensé que no sería bonito ser el primero en rendirse. arrrggg!!! el triple jaque!!! en este momento, no sólo cuartas había olido la sangre, mis compañeros de mesa también y el ps pous (pequeñosaltamontes, título que se otorga antres de gm, granmaestro) me dijo: "parece que has sacado al rey a pasear"... de qué me sonaba a mí aquella frase??? y por si fuera poco que me comiera la reina, cuartas miró 2 segundos más y dijo:"juas, además mate en 3"... y siguió su despiadada ronda. cuartas: "tres y jaque" cuartas: "dos y jaque" cuartas: "uno y jaquemate". aquí en este momento, y tras haber visto como cuartas iba dedicando a la gente los bonitos comentarios de "me has caído mal" y demás, pensé. "ahora gritará me he cargado al primero" y la gente saldrá corriendo despavorida, pero todo quedó en un estrechón de manos y la foto de la prensa...   ... ah! ya recuerdo quien dijo aquello, nuestro amigo leoncho: "... y el imprudente aficionado sacó el rey a pasear", "recuerden, por su bien, el rey a buen recaudo". 
-------------------------------------
black built up a series of small advantages to break through and win a pawn on move 20.  the game continued with a rook on the 2nd rank that confined white's king, allowed black to advance up the board, and mate.  please feel free to message me if you have comments, questions, or find any mistakes. the sicilian defence breaks symmetry by contesting the d4 square with the c pawn rather than the e pawn.  white often attacks the kingside while black obtains a queenside advantage.  grandmaster john nunn noted that the reason for the sicilian defence’s popularity “is its combative nature; in many lines black is playing not just for equality, but for the advantage. the drawback is that white often obtains an early initiative, so black has to take care not to fall victim to a quick attack.” attempting to reestablish symmetry, this often transposes into positions arising from the english opening.  2. nf3 is most common. preparing for d5. ?! - dubious.  white's kingside bishop can already be developed via e2, so weakening the kingside castle is unneccessary.  better is nc3, contesting the center d6 square. ?! - dubious.  developing the queen too early often leads to a loss of tempo as she is attacked and forced to move multiple times.  better is nc3. after the exchange, white is left with a backward pawn on the half-open d file.  this will become the focus for an attack. developing with tempo. moving the rook off of the long diagonal and preparing to fianchetto the lightsquared bishop to counter white's bishop.  it may have been better to play b6, allowing bb7 next move. finally developing the 2nd white knight, but too late to influence the earlier exchange. opening up the bishop and threatening black's knight.  also threatens mate (qxh7#) if black's f6 knight can be lured away. forcing the queen to retreat again. white's queen has moved 4 times and returned to her original square, effectively wasting 4 moves.  during that time, black has developed all but one of his pieces and constructed a solid pawn chain supporting a centralized knight.  however, advantages in development and time are temporary and need to be taken advantage of immediately or the opponent will have the opportunity to equalize. countering the strong white bishop. exchanging the bishops leaves the pawns around white's king weak.  the exchange also lifted black's rook, enabling black to to easily double pieces on the half-open d file. attempting to trade off black's dominating centralized knight. protecting the rook from nf3 (or bb2, though that would give up the d pawn).  16...ne4?! 17. nxe4 rxe4 18. bb2 would isolate black's rook in the center and give white some counterplay. qe2 is probably better, as it still allows rd1, protecting the d pawn, and protects ng3 attacking the g5 knight and preparing bg6. ne4 may have been better as this regulates the knight to the edge of the board for most of the rest of the game.  perhaps white was expecting to follow it up with ng4, forcing the rook to retreat. taking the long diagonal and threatening white's rook.  this prevents the possibility of a3 and ra2. preparing for rd8, which would triple pieces on the d file, further pressuring the d pawn. giving up the d pawn. not 20...bxb2? 21. rxb2 rd8 22. rd1, which would protect the d pawn (after nf6-e4, white could add more pressure to the d pawn, however white could play 23. nf4 forcing rd4 and play for a draw with 24. ne2). eliminating the potentially dangerous bishop. the exchange leaves black with a rook on the 2nd rank, where it will dominate the rest of the game.  the power of a rook on the 2nd rank is two fold: it confines the king to the back rank and forces the opponent to defend pawns with pieces. attempting to defend the a pawn.  unfortunately, white has few alternatives.  ng5 (or ng4) followed by h3 would have driven the black knight off, but would have surrendered the queenside pawns in the process.    ng5 followed by nf3 would have forced black to either give up the d file or the 2nd rank.  if black could have seized the d file, it may have been worth the a and b pawns. preventing ng5. better is nf4, centralizing the knight.  this pins the f pawn, though to be fair, white is in danger of losing either the f or a pawn no matter what he does. preventing nf4.  if 27. kf3 then f5 traps the king and forces a further loss of time. abandons the h pawn, hoping to attack the rook.   offering to trade the a pawn for black's e pawn. trading pawns would allow white some counterplay along the open e file, so black refuses. since the d file is now closed, black feels safe enough to pick up the unprotected a pawn. the exchange gives black a passed pawn. finally mobilizing the king.  as more pieces leave the board, the king becomes more and more powerful.  he'll need to escort the pawns forward and eventually help give mate. trading queenside pawns to prevent surprises from that side of the board. because black had already moved off of the back rank, he wasn't trapped like white's king. reestablishing 2nd rank dominance. prevents white from escaping. white is already lost as this point, as black will slowly advance his pawns while continuing to confine the white king.  however, ra1, ra3, or ra4 will provide more resistance than random checks. the check just pushes black's king where he wants it.  better would be rd8 forcing black to be careful of the pawn. hoping to prevent queening or escape the back rank. with white on the back rank, black set a trap. ? - bad, facing either mate or loss of the rook.  this was the only major blunder of the game. white overlooked the mate.  however, even 45. kg1 doesn't save white after d2 46. kh2 (rg6 d1=q  47. kh2 rxf2  48. kh3 qh1#) d1=q 47. kh3 48. qh1#.  .   0-1  please feel free to message me if you have comments, questions, or find any mistakes. 
-------------------------------------
the short variation of the caro-kann defence. blacks position is usually cramped but it has absolutely no weaknesses if you treat it right. this is the state-of-the-art treatment of this branch. the great protagonist of this variation, anatoly karpov, lost a theoretically important game versus boris gelfand in their 1995 fide world chess championchip candidates match after 9. … dxc4 and gave up the caro-kann for the rest of this match. but since then the black knights strengthened their stonghold. :-) a rare move also prefered by engines. 10. nc3 ... is more common. i hadn't seen this move before, but in my opinion it's a strong move because black has to work hard to develop and even to castle. 16. ... nc6? 17. bxd5 exd5 18. nxc6 bxc6 19. rxc6 ... engines also consider my opponents choice to exchange his rook for a bishop and two pawns obviously aiming to push forward the passed pawns while most human players might have prefered 18. txc1 ... maybe better 19. ... h6. but i thought that opening the 8th rank for the rook would accelerate the rooks development. offering the bishops exchange aiming on releasing white's pressure. the black king is infighting trying to stop the passed pawns. aiming on exchanging the bishop b5 to destroy white's strong bishop pair. of course not 30. ... kxa7 because of 31. sc6 ... +.  black has solved all problems. there is no danger that the passed pawn could be promoted. that defends the passed pawn. -white must have planned this move when he moved 28. a6+ ... .  but destroying my opponents strong bishop pair improved my prospects. so what to do for black to counter white's initative? the only chance i saw was to push forward my kings flank pawns. a kind of wait-and-see-move. i didn't like 37. ... h4 because i thought this would give white the opportunity to block the kings flank. i thought that 38. ... gxh4 39. gxh4 rd8 would have been too slow and i didn't see how to advance at the kings flank. so i decided to push the g-pawn forward and to try to break through with the rook on the d-file. 40. ... rc1 is met by 41. kg5 ... so black has no time to lose. obviously dreaming of promoting one of the passed pawns. but black's king and rook are strong enough to defend this threat. in the end this attempt loses a pawn for white. white has lost a pawn. black's pawn f7 is defended tactically. there is no real chance for black to promote his passed pawn. so this manoeuvre is just an attempt looking if black treats this episode fine.  so what has black to do next? attacking white's pawn c5! black is still a pawn up but still the position should be almost equal because for the moment white can defend his pawns and it is hard to see how black can progress. meanwhile i had been contented with a draw, but my opponent declined my draw offer. so i was forced to play for a win. :-) black has to exchange or better to erase white's pawns to progress. 56. ... kxe4? is met by 57. ng5+ ... overcoming white's defense of his pawn. okay folks, from now on only black can hope for a win. but already wilhelm steinitz knew that this endgame of black rook vs. white knight is equal if white succeeds in keeping a close connection between king and knight. so my only chance was to try to create difficulties for my opponent in that.
-------------------------------------
  aiming to force back the black king on the first line to intensify white's problems to keep the connection between king and knight. succeeded in forcing back the white king. 63. ... ke3? aiming for a mate is of course met my 64. nf1+ ...  so the rook has to leave the square h2 first. aiming for a mate on the first line.  okay that didnt't work and i had to concentrate on escaping the threefold repetition. for a moment the contact between king and knight is interrupted because of black's pressure. but until now this isn't enough for black to win. the only move that keeps the connection between king and knight and thus keeps white in the game. for example 69. na1 ... ? is met by 69. ... rb1+. i was trying to keep the king locked in lying in wait for the critical mistake. again the only move.  threatening the mate on the first line. the critical mistake! now the white knight is seperated from his king and will fall prey to black sooner or later. obviously my opponent didn’t knew the aforementioned rule for this endgame. it’s notable that even today strong engines have problems to realize that from now on white is lost. even after deep calculation they admire 71. nc5+ .. , 71. nc1+ ... and 71. ke1 ... as equal. but only 71. nc1+ ... is drawish while 71. nc5+ ... ? and also 71. ke1 ... ? lose. so the consequences of his move must have been beyond my opponents horizon. or 72. nb3+ kc3 and then 73. nc5 rh4 or 73. nc1 rh1+ or 73. na5 rh4 and so on. there is no way back for the white knight. or 74. na8 kd6 or 74. ne8 rb7. as i mentioned there is no way out for the white knight. the rest is silence. that indeed was a lot of hard work, folks!

-------------------------------------
white's aggressive opening move opens lines for the queen and king's bishop and fights for control of the squares d5 and f5.  black plays the classical response to 1. e4. by mirroring white's move black has guaranteed himself an equal share of the centre and scope to develop his pieces. 1...e5 is one of the few moves that directly interferes with white's plan of playing d4. ye olde stuff here. i attack black's king pawn, preparing for kingside castling, and preparing for d2–d4.  is the natural move, combining defence of the pawn with control of the d4 square and refusing to commit another pawn. the extent of this move's popularity is such that the typical player of 2. nf3 as white is already thinking beyond it to their third move, safe in the knowledge that any variation by black will play into their hands.  white has multiple choices here which can lead to very different games. 3. bb5 (ruy lopez) is the most played. white puts pressure on the knight defending the pawn. i was thinking of 3. d4 (scotch) because my opponent wanted a "fast correspondence game" and 3. d4 is aggressive but decided against it as i have not played it in a very long time...not seriously anyways... enter the ruy lopez. white threatens to trade the bishop against the knight, leaving the pawn undefended. it is not a real threat as after 4. bxc6 dxc6 5. nxe5, black can fork the knight and a pawn with 5...qd4 or 5...qg5. as nothing's urgent, black can respond in a variety of ways. the most common move is the morphy defence : 3...a6, forcing white to make a decision about his bishop. many other moves are available, some neglecting completely the protection of the knight and the pawn and continuing development.   i assumed he would choose a route that would let us really open of the center...   the berlin defence!?!?!, 3...nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is sometimes called "the berlin wall". this was not what i expected considering they wanted this game to be a speed game! if he wanted fast and some action why did he not take 3. ... a6  so might be able to follow 4. bxc6 (ruy lopez exchange variation) or any other line for that matter? i follow the line by the numbers (yes i have my notes open at this time) and castle. i wondered if he thought i might come with 4. d3 ("steinitz's move") and set myself up for mortimer's trap. maybe so...that might explain what happened next. he already went with the berlin defence line in this so called "speed correspondence game" and now...he closes it!?!?! he could have played the solid 4...nxe4 or the more combative 4...bc5 (the berlin classical variation), but no...i am stuck trying to hurry through ...sharp lines...open it up...anything... cause he wants to be done in an hour!   here i go making yet another attempt to get us away from slow and drawish. even if it actually increases his winning chances!  i have done what i can to continue to develop safely up to this point and attack get some kind of middle game going.  we are out of my notes now and there is just too much shit on the board still for me to count very far ahead.  this pawn move, i thought, should make him shit or get off the pot! i thought maybe he would 7. ... nb4. then maybe i would follow up with 8. qe2 and he would 8. ... 0-0 and finally castle and we could get a move on. could have even gone  7. ... nb4  8.bxd7 followed by either nxd7 or qxd7  and then 9.a3 with his knight backed up to a6 square. nope!!! he backed up to his starting square.  now he kinda makes me bring my queen out to d3 (i guess qe2 would have worked too) to defend both the the pawn at e4 and the bishop at b5.    i considered 8.nc3 to defend the same squares but this was not some lightning real time game on yahoo (where i know i would have done it). i started playing correspondence so i could take my time and develop as a player...see deeper faster...learn more theory.  i saw lines like 8. ... nxe4 9. bxe7 qxe7 10. nxe4 bxb5  where i am down a pawn and have my rook under attack by blacks's light bishop. getting in a hurry would have cost me material and momentum. i chose this over 8. bxd7 to deny him a chance to re-develop his b1 knight with nb1xd7. i worried he might 8. ... nxe4 this move than covered that.   if for example they 8. ... nxe4 i could follow with 9. bxd7+. black's response to that could have been 9. ... nxd7 or qxd7 and would still get hammered by 10. qxe4 scooping back the lost material +2.  black finally castles, i develop my knight to the c3 square and black attacks my light bishop on b5. finally black does something less that passive. i did those to avoid all together 10. ba4 b5 11. bb3  lines that might involve me moving a3 at some point and tucking my light bishop into the a2 square. i am ahead i saw combinations of h6 attacking my dark bishop and blacks night on the g4 sqaure in my future without this move. although i did almost move ra1-e1 here, i did not want to give up a chance to attack on the queen side near his idle queenside knight. with 11. h3 i made h7-h6 a pointless waste of time and gave my self a few moves to get over to his queen side without his night in my house. no point in getting into a fight here that could result with a knight attacking my queen from f4 so... ...i tuck back my bishop and black pulls back his knight...looks to me like i just gained momentum from black without even thinking more than 1 move ahead!!! i brought the rook over generally to support my coming f and e pawn pushes that i hope are coming...no real depth of play other than in the vague visions provided by just a couple moves thought. blacks pushing the c pawn was lost on me and i spent little time on it because it gave me my first choice of direction...a queen side attack with a queen/rook fork on the horizon black is now paying for the reverse development of the knight.  as the capture of the rook was certain black seems to have decided to make room for his underachieving knight to get out of the way... moving the queen tell me that they had to suffer this process for longer than a lesser player might have... and still ...nothing they can do to stop it.... chomp!!!! +2!! and ready to push now i will share the chat dialog...  that led up to the draw over the course of the game.... me: speedgame? maxiol09: yes, game in 1 hour! me: ohhh ok then i can stay up  me: hope you dont mind i have ruy notes open maxiol09: ok, all right me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9k-phnveek&feature=player_embedded me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oztlwxggkv8&feature=plcp&context=c3d38898udoegstopdskku2icvy6t-8bqdjwre0_7n maxiol09: no in this moment me: even with the two pawn gain...i would rather offer draw...want a draw? ( i said this after he opened the b6 square to my night with 13. ... c6) me: will give you a couple minutes to think about it...next move is na8 maxiol09: i don't understand me: my next move...na8 i will trade knight for rook a plus two point (or pawn) gain in material...even though it puts me ahead ...i would be willing to give you a draw....as i am not at ease with my chances of winning (not in a couple minutes anyways) me: do you want me to offer a draw? maxiol09: why? we just started playing! me: i dont think i can finish in one hour and beat you...if you dont mind it going over its ok (i offered the draw after the c4 push)  it took me an hour to get where i wanted to be (13. ... c6 )in an open i am not familiar with...i knew that they wanted it short from the start...so i gave away what was in my mind...a sure win... :-( 
-------------------------------------
hello! will try to annotate a fun and interesting game i played recently against -mark-. i sacrificed a whole rook (maybe incorrect) but get excellent mating opportunities instead! we plays the robatsch defence, the rossolimo variation.  now have we both castled kingside and so far followed the theory.  somewhat aggressive move? this pawn probably want to advance to b4 and chase my knight away! an option for me is now a3 to prevent this, but i played bd3 instead! first now we begin to leave the opening theory and must start to think on our own! pushing my e-pawn forward! will try to open up in the center! rather complicated! maybe this move by me seems a little bit odd out? but i want to protect my e-pawn better and my dark-squared bishop also aims towards the black king! this move seems a little bit awkward out for me? this rook could play a more active role on other squares! retreat! black doesn´t have to been afraid of c 4. if i do that move here, i will simply lose that pawn! threatening the black queen. if i was black, i would try to exchange dark-squared  bishops here. that action will also make white`s c-pawn significantly weaker! i´m starting to gain a small space advantage here! the white queen is aiming against the black king! a rook lift. common in positions like this! placing my pieces better before the breakthrough! interesting sacrifice, i have tried to analyze what would happen if black accept it and it would probably lead to checkmate in some moves! but, because i´m not a very good analyzer i can maybe missed something? but at least i had won the piece back! black chosed to deny my sacrifice. as i just mentioned it would be better for black to take the piece, probably winning, because my sacrifice was incorrect. white tries to open up lines for the queen and rook! i develop all my pieces towards the kingside, maybe the right continuation? an interference check by black! a pretty good move, i think? advancing with my h-pawn! a pawn for free! but how is it best to continue after this? tripling pieces against blacks f-pawn. can´t take at f7 for tactical reasons! now is it necessary for black to protect his f-pawn. but black`s position begins to look very cramped! advancing with my g-pawn, but it is complicated and not easy to find a winning move for me! for example, g6 is not a winning continuation! a new idea! white takes control over the a-file with one of his rooks and is planning to occupy the a7-square with the rook! a rook sacrifice that seems a little bit strange for me, when i look back at this game. pretty good move i believe? forces black to exchange queens and gives white three advanced free pawns and also some very serious threats against black`s king! forced move! blocks white`s discovered check in the following move. probably the best move in this position? threatens the weak black b-pawn. aiming to enforce black to weaken his position because of the need to protect weak pawns! white threats another pawn, wants to weaken blacks position so much as possible! now can white´s king sneak in to the h5-square! too late! rather bad move by black, what was the purpose to double his rooks on the c-file in this crucial situation of the game? unpinning the g-pawn! the last mistake by black! black gave up, because if...kf8 then h8q# and if ...kh8 then a discovered check with the move f7 and the only answer to that is ...e5, but then bxe5#!

salut,______je te mets ici un resume de la méthode pour analyser sa partie.______1. ouverture______qui connaissait les coups théoriques le plus loin dans l’ouverture?______l’autre? alors il faut travailler l'ouverture______2. milieu de partie______ai-je été capable de reconnaître les menaces de chacun des coups de mon adversaire ?______ai-je eu un plan ?______trouver ses erreurs (tactiques ou stratégiques : la ou est l'erreur c'est la ou il faut travailler)______découvrir de nouvelles idées ?______3. les finales______identifier la technique a utiliser. etait-elle maitrisee ? si non....au boulot.______addendum______- decouvrir le tournant de la partie et évaluer votre prise de décision lors de ces moments.______- quel coup on est content d'avoir joue ?______- quel coup on sera content de ne pas avoir joue ?______- la gestion du temps ? si on a joue trop vite alors on note son temps de jeu a chaque coup (ou le dire à haute voix si on est devant un ecran) c'est bien egalement de noter comment c'est deroule le tournoi.______ouverture avec les blancs______ouverture avec les noirs (1.e4, d4, c4, cf3)______est-ce que j'ai etudie les finales, mon milieu de partie, fait des exos tactiques______resultat de la ronde n°x, nom adversaire, elo adversaire, le tournant de la partie, la raison de la victoire ou de la defaire______noter sur 20 sa capacite de concentration. je suis toujours dans la theorie (3.bd3 empeche 3...ff5) j'ai suppose que comme toute bird, on ne laisse pas fg4____par contre comme il n'y a pas eu de roque noir ca ne va pas marcher h3-g4. aie aie aie, c'est difficile de jouer contre ce sacrifice. le roi blanc va bien se faire attaquer. pour absolument relancer le plus tot possible et obtenir du jeu aile-dame. pas sur du tout de ce coup. est-ce que c'est bien de prendre de l'espace ? c'est le coup que j'aimerai reprendre.______mais aucune idee de quoi jouer a la place.____ca montre donc que je dois travailler la strategie car je ne suis pas capable de jouer cette position. la suite de coup me semble etre plus tactique qu'autre chose. je ne fais pas le malin et je m'attends a me faire mater dans les coups qui suivent. avec l'idee de rammener un defenseur sur l aile roi. je crois que maintenant c'est moi qui reprend le dessus. j'ai survecu je ne sais pas trop comment______est-ce que j'ai ete vraiment menace finalement ? mon plan est de balancer tout les pions sur l'aile dame pour ouvrir des lignes. j'espere que ce sera plus rapide que les pions noirs aile roi. j'avoue que je n'y crois pas trop. la par contre je crois que c'est fini pour les noirs maintenant. j'ai passe du temps sur ce coup a essayer de calculer comment mater.______c'est le coup dont je suis content pour cette partie.  
-------------------------------------
toujours dans la theorie, je te fais confiance je ne connais pas.  j'aime !  parfait, meme sur fg6 apres fxg6 c'est mauche pour lui, et je ne pense pas que le sacrifice de cavalier soit si bon que ca.  pour absolument relancer le plus tot possible et obtenir du jeu aile-dame.  je pense que fermer le jeu n'est pas tres bon pour toi a cause de l'attaque sur l'aile roi qui pourrait arriver vite. je pense plus à cc3 ou fd2, continuer le developpement.  tu avais vu fh3 ? apres ca je ne pense pas jouer de1, mais continuer sur cc3  heureusement qu'il ne pense pas jouer g5 etc...  est que tu as ete vraiment menacé, je pense que oui, ouvrir un peu plus l'aile roi etait peu etre dangereux pour blanc  je pense plus que tu craigne grand chose maintenant c'est la course au pion !  par une science que je ne connais pas, j'arrive plus souvent dans le grand roque que dans le petit... c'est cool non ? :d  je crois aussi que c'est fini pour les noirs maintenant.  jolie combi bravo, toute les pieces s'y mettent !   
-------------------------------------
en bilan, une ouverture désastreuse dès le 6ème coup. je m'en sors sur une erreur et une boulette de l'adversaire. c'est donc même pas la peine de trop analyser. hop au boulot ouverture.___je viens d eme rendre compte que c'est contre loopy que j'ai eu aussi la même ouverture. lui non plus il n'a pas bossé :-)) et bien me voilà déjà à la fin de la théorie que je connais. pas terrible, il y a du boulot. flute, je me rends compte que je peux jouer qa5 (comme la partie précédente). quelle nouille ! je m'en veux sur le moment....mais j'ai une super excuse, j'ai mal à la tête, je suis sous antibio :-) je ne suis pas spécialement convaincu par ce coup. 6...f6 c'est peut-être mieux. bon je viens de regarder avec un module. 6...nxe5 ça m'aurai bien plu de penser à ce coup. c'est donc le coup que je reprendrais bien pour cette partie. suite à ce coup son fou va forcément être échangé. je pense que c'est bien pour moi d'avoir la paire de fous. j'ai pas mal hésité avec 9...dxc en supposant la ligne 9...dxc 10.dxc qxd1 11.rxd1 rd1 et je suis finalement parti sur 9...f6 qui  m'a mis dedans quelques coups plus tard. c'est la panique, je ne sais pas comment répondre, je suis complétement étouffé, les cavaliers blancs sont très menaçant. je vais me prendre 13.nxe5, la misère. faut vraiment que je bosse cette ouverture. oooouuuuffff e6 va ramasser. ca va être difficile de mettre plus de pièce pour défendre e6 après ne2-f4, alors je tente ma chance d'essayer de faire reculer les blancs. je ne calcule pas trop, on verra bien. là je crois que j'ai ma chance. comment il va défendre 2 pièces en l'air ? je pense qu'il s'est planté dans la défense, je vais avoir 2 pièces mineures pour la tour. mais surtout je fais un gros calcul car si il joue bxg7, qc3 et bh8, il faut absolument que mon cavalier puisse revenir sur la diagonale a1-h8. je pense que ça va tenir, non pas grâce à mon cavalier mais grâce à e6-e5. et voilà, on est en plein dans la ligne dangereuse. j'espère avoir bien visualisé. un peu de stress là ! c'est ce que j'aime en live par rapport en différé. voilà la fin de ma visualisation, en voyant la position au présent, j'ai l'impression que je vais tenir. la dame blanche va m'embetter mais je suppose que je vais pouvoir contenir et échanger cette pièce. j'ai un petit doute, allez à la pèche au pion ce n'est peut-être pas le meilleur moment. mais je pense que ça va surtout affaiblir son potentiel d'attaque aile roi et aussi dénudé son roi. ralala, il va me faire c***r avec son cav, c'est sur. pour les coups suivant je souhaite arriver à échanger les dames. et voilà, maintenant je crois que les blancs n'ont plus rien. mais c'est loin d'être gagné pour autant. juste jouer zen, sans forcer les choses, échanger au maximum et surtout ce cav qui peut faire des fourchettes (que je pleure si ça m'arrive à cette partie,^^). et mettre une douce pression sur ses pions. hop, plus de cav, un pion en moins, la maintenant je commence à me sentir serein (mais méfiant quand même) là je pense que c'est complétement fini. il va jouer au bout, c'est sur. alors juste à éviter le pat. histoire de voir si je peux échanger les tours. pendant que j'avance mon pion je visualise le mat, re5+ à la découverte puis qc5  
-------------------------------------
alternative variation: 5.nh4 [ besser laut fritz ]   like french  alternative variation: 8.be3 [ besser laut fritz ]   alternative variation: 9...qb6 [ i had expected ]   i kind of know from the french, is not so good, according to fritz  alternative variation: 10.dxc5 [ i have not seen, win a pawn? ]   dd2 is not designed to prevent sbd2 to   alternative variation: 12.a4 [ besser laut fritz ]   i did´t know what to move  alternative variation: 14.nf1 [ besser laut fritz ]   with the plan sg3-sh5-sf6   new plan ng4-nf6, but the knghts a standing away   developed the the bishop and covers the weak field f6   i wanted to keep the bishop, if he has intentions of exchange   theknight  in the middle and force f5   victims combination   now 2 pawn against one piece   rough patzer   alternative variation: 21.qd1 [ besser laut fritz ]   the quality and one pown more away   on the e-line figures are important, and when the queen has moved away, is tied f5   alternative variation: 25...qc7 26.qxf5   blocks b5 and atacks fields in the black area   raise the shackling on   alternative variation: 32.bc3 [ besser laut fritz ]   according to fritz poor white problem, because ne4 was not seen. as weiss has too early abandoned?   usw. usw. => draw   
-------------------------------------
un seguito assai bizzarro e provocatorio che popchev ha giocato abbastanza spesso il bianco non si dimostra interessato al dibattito teorico e sceglie una linea prudente. volendo cercare di confutare la variante del nero il seguito più energico è 4. d5 dove il nero può scegliere tra 4...cd4 e la bizzarra 4... cb8  sicuramente la continuazione più energica. era comunque giocabile 4...d6  il bianco continua a scegliere soluzioni tranquille. dopo 5. exd5 cb4 oppure 5. cxd5 e6 (con l'idea di rifarsi sul pedone d4) il nero ha forse maggiori difficoltà per dimostrare la correttezza del suo impianto  una novità rispetto a 6...ag4 che era stata giocata in precedenza  attaccando entrambi i cavalli neri il bianco non si fida ad entrare nelle complicazioni conseguenti a 9. axh6 axh6 10. dxh6 cxc2+ 11. rd1 dxd5+ 12. rxc2 af5 con posizione poco chiara (ma non necessariamente cattiva per il bianco)  l'unica mossa logica! dopo aver giocato fin qui  in modo prudente (e anche troppo) il bianco pecca gravemente di ottimismo. si  imponeva la semplice 12. o-o anche se dopo 12...cf5 non sembra che il nero abbia grossi problemi. con l'arrocco lungo il re bianco è un bersaglio ideale il nero con questo sacrificio passa decisamente in vantaggio dopo 13. bxa5 cf5  o 13...cg4 il vantaggio del nero sarebbe evidente, visto che le sue prospettive d'attacco sul re avversario sarebbero concrete mentre quelle del bianco sarebbero inesistenti  liberando la casa di fuga d2 per il re il modo più energico per evitare la fuga! non ci sono altri modi per evitare il matto il cambio delle donne è forzato. dopo 16...dxa6?? 17.dxc3 l'attacco del nero si affloscia come un sufflé mal riuscito. il pedone c3 è di importanza fondamentale evidentemente il nero non ha previsto la mazzata che gli arriverà alla 18a mossa. era migliore 17.fxe3 alla quale popchev sull'informatore dedica la seguente variante 17.fxe3 ta6 18.rb1 te8 19.td3 af5 20.txc3 tea8 21.te1 ta1+ 22.rb2 t8a2+ 23.rb3 ae6+ 24.rb4 ta4+ 25.rc5 ta5+ 26.rd4 td5+ 27.re4 ta4+ 28.cd4 c5 e il nero ottiene una posizione vincente.  l'alfiere si immola (solo apparentemente) per sgombrare la strada alla torre in f8. ovviamente non c'è tempo di catturare l'alfiere: occorre cercare di approntare una difesa per l minacce sul re. non c'è speranza dopo 20. rc1 ta8  la botta finale. il re non ha difesa malgrado l'esiguità del materiale rimasto il bianco abbandona, visto che il matto si riesce ad evitare solo a prezzi esorbitanti. morale: attenzione a dove si arrocca ... 
-------------------------------------
toward classic stonwall attack black knight looking for trouble the attack begins paun eats, en generates the freeway to the king plays queen because he doesn´t want to lose the intrepid knight, huge mistake! stonewall crazy knight i appears, double threat in this place black pieces are not in bad position, near the king, queen attacks directly, intrepid black knight is not dead nice change, to aligarate pressure on the other knight and movement of the queen. crazy knight goes directly to king crazy knight ii start playing, agressive, if succesful, black king castle is flanqued by the crazy knights. then black plays amazing last resort! sacrifice queen looking for direct attack with bishop and knight only option for the white never give up! never white king much exposed than black, but any mistake and it´s mate hole for the king, feels the pressure black goes all in and, avoids hole hacked by the bishop but... good blocking but stonewall crazy knight had one battle left before retiree king sorrounded, caught by the back, chekmate.  anusual stonewall, the liberation of the crazy knight generates a freeway in the midd field, with white pieces placed previously than blacks there is an advantage, usual stonewall responses to a king castle in the other sight of the field, so the crazy knight doesn´t exist, is rapidly changed to avoid a fast mate. but here they found a place for their crazyness, freeway to the knights!!!! 
-------------------------------------
a nice opening this is usual in the stonewall attack, going for c3 all normal this is a variation, more often seeing ne5, but i was pushing e6 pawn left shifted queen enforce the knightt attack, f7 a little back for safe i must admit this move leads to wrong very often, but with de ne6 still, king area gets more pushed. and also must admit i really like this move! the midd canal, now g6 is under pressure here is a mistake, i went out of ideas at the moment, and get into trouble a little advantage, time to play all in quit the b so it does´t get busted by the queen if i use b on c2 the sacrifice, and a good one i think breaking king´s castle open space for bishop, thought h5 will be a nice a defence for eventuallities black attack continues natural defence destroy castle this is just crazy!! i mean the hole table close tower getting back and with a little fortune it is over perfect structure is no way out the end (qh7 mate). really enjoyed!! thank you!!  
-------------------------------------
a popular first move. i was trying something new - i would usually reply by pushing the pawn up to e5, but i decided to try this… he pushes up his other pawn. i like that position. i attack his e-pawn with my d-pawn while being protected by my own e-pawn. i would've pushed the pawn up to e5, but i'm not a great player, so i don't know what's best. he takes my pawn on d5. i obviously take his pawn. my pawn is protected by my queen, but he still opens up his knight. i give the pawn double protection, as i don't like getting my queen out early. he now has both his knights out. i open up my own knight. i see the threat of nxe6, but i don't really care… i open up my other knight, giving the pawn triple protection. he takes my bishop. i obviously take his knight, but it gives me a disadvantage, as i don't like to castle in this position. he opens up his bishop, giving him the option to castle. i threaten his bishop - quite like what he did to me, but on the other side. he castles. i take his bishop. he uses his queen to take my knight. i open up my queen, preparing for: ng4 - threatening mate. he threats my queen, but also threats: nc7 if i move the queen to a wrong square. i move my queen out of the threat, also protecting the c7 square. now he is free to move his knight to c7 again, because he is protected by the bishop on f4. i protect the c7 square by using my bishop to block the path of the enemy bishop.  he takes my bishop with his own. i take his bishop with my pawn, a position i don't like very much because it can't move anywhere. he  threatens my pawn with his rook. i protect the pawn with my king. he double protects his knight with his a-pawn. i threaten his knight with my pawn, forcing him to move, but seeing this: nc3+qb2 (free pawn). he threatens my queen, but forgetting his knight! i take with the queen, and receive a free knight! :d he takes my queen with his own. i obviously take his queen with my pawn. he double protects his pawn on a5. i move my rook threatening his pawn on c2. he pushes his pawn up.. i except the swap he takes the pawn… …and i take his! he checks me with his rook.  a bad move, i realize this soon. i though he should have check me, winning a rook, but i didn't see my knight. not a very good move, he still has the choice of checking my king with his rook and getting my rook. he threatens my pawn. i take his pawn, checking the king and being protected by the knight on e4. his only option. i threaten his pawn. he checks my king down the g-file with his rook. i should of blocked with the knight, but i move my king out of the way of the castle. now he should have checked me!! i threaten his rook with my knight. finally!!! he checks my king and my only option is to move out of the way, exposing my rook to capture. :(! damn!!! he takes the rook… …and i take his with my knight! he takes the knight. i'm in a good position. +2 up, with nothing but  rook and pawns, but more pawns then my opponent. i take his pawn, threatening another. and he takes mine. i protect the pawn with my king. he moves his rook on to my bank rank, preparing to threaten and capture my pawns one-by-one. i take his other pawn! he threatens the-already-protected pawn. i push up my pawn… the race has started! he threatens my pawn on d6. i move my pawn out of the way. the king comes to meet the pawns… …but he can't! he has been cut off by my rook! he moves his king in front of my pawn. my pawn can move one square but no more! my pawn moves one square. :d i don't know what he's doing here. i threaten his rook and move my king up to protect the pawn for when i check the king with my rook. he threatens my pawn with his rook… …and i ignore it! now if i move my castle to b2, the king must move to e, d, or c1, and then i will be able to push my pawn up one more square… one square from promoting! he takes my pawn. i check him with my… the plan is working. :) he moves hi king straight back to d1. i push my pawn up, and his king is almost entirely trapped! a smart move. he prevents my king from completely trapping the king, then i would just need to push my rook up to b1, and unstoppable move (checkmate). i push my pawn up, hoping to block his rook from preventing my king from going through the third rank. he's going for a queen! but i ignore it, for i shall beat him to it. he pushes up again, he's three squares away! he should of just moved his king to e2. but i ignore it again, and now i'm one move away from completely trapping his king! he suicides his rook - fair enough. :d now i am +6 up, with a rook and an extra pawn. two squares away… once again, i ignore it and trap his king, his only option is to move one of his pawns, which is then answered by r#b1. unstoppable checkmate (white resigned). here's what would've happened. one square away… checkmate!!! :d what a game! i couldn't believe i had beaten a player rated 1543! i am very proud to have won this game. i hoped you enjoyed the annotated game, thank you! :>d nah, that nose looks bad.

my favorite first move, one i almost always use. he uses a popular response. i open up my knight, threatening his pawn. he protects with his pawn, a move that i wouldn't do, i would usually respond by nc6 or bd6. i open up my other knight protecting my pawn from any possible threats. he opens up his knight. i am now in a position to castle. he pushes his pawn up one square. i threaten his pawn, he now has a choice, protect the e5 pawn with one of his pieces or take my pawn… he takes my pawn. and i take his. he threatens my pawn on e4, i can protect my pawn using my other pawn on f2, my bishop, or my queen, but i don't like using my queen to early unless i see a good opportunity. i check with my bishop, he now can't take my pawn due to the threat and he must block the check. he blocks with his knight - probably the best move. i castle. he could of taken the free pawn, but he got is bishop out of the way in order to castle. i protect the pawn with my rook. he castles. i open up my bishop, protecting the e5 square for: e5. he opens up his knight threatening my pawn on e4. i my pawn up to e5, as planned. he takes my pawn. and i take his pawn with my own. :d his knight is in the open, but has double protection. i take his knight with my own… …and he takes mine with his own. i threaten his knight with my pawn. and he retreats… …only to be threatened again by another one of my pawns! he retreats yet again, and now have the option of capturing his knight… … i do. :) and he takes me back. :( i threaten his queen with my own queen and my knight, seeing: 17. qxd1 ne7! 18. kh8 qxd1! just as planned… i capture his bishop… for free! and check his king, forcing him to move, which then allows me to capture his queen! :d the only possible move. and i get his queen! he threatens my knight… …and i protect it. he threatens my rook, not seeing the free pawn i can capture. i capture the free pawn. he threatens my bishop with his pawn. and i retreat. he threatens my pawn on c2. so i protect it. he blocks himself in! i threaten: 25. rxg7. he could've also played: g6. i get ready for: bc2 re7 - threatening his g-pawn. he's planning to check me after: re7, although checking me won't do much. i push up my rook… and he resigns! :d what a game. i won with a bit of luck but it was a tight game in the end. 
-------------------------------------
i was trying out a new opening, seeing if it was any good, so i played e3. he responds with what i would normally play. i push up my pawn. he mirrors my move. i push my knight up behind my pawn - like in the sicilian defence. i don't like moving there, i think it opens up the rook to much. i move out my bishop, preparing for: nf3 and then o-o. he opens up his bishop, but not the way i would. i push out my knight, preparing to castle. he opens up his knight, but notice that none of his kingside pieces are open. i castle. he opens up his knight, his first kingside piece is out. i attack both his pawns with the protection of my knight, two pawns and queen. he takes my pawn which will soon lead to a lot of trading and taking on d4. i take his pawn. he takes my pawn and now all the pawns in the centre are about to disappear. i take the last pawn in the centre. he takes my knight with his own. now i have my queen out and deadly, and my two bishops have much space to move around in. he opens up his own queen. i threaten: bf3, checking the king and threatening the rook. he threatens my queen, which delays my threat. now i'm also threatening: bg5, putting pressure on the knight. he castles, and my hope of bf3 evaporates. now i'm threatening: bg5, which means he can't move his knight without checkmate. he threatens my rook with his own, challenging me to take his rook. i accept. he takes my rook back. i threaten his queen with knight. he checks me, which can easily protected by… …bf1. he threatens my knight. i take his knight… …and he takes mine. i take the free pawn… blunder: -mate (15) it's true, i tried to create the puzzle but it said: error, too many possible solutions. i push up my bishop, and he resigns, almost unstoppable checkmate. :d that was a good game. we were both very attacking but i managed to scrape a win! 
-------------------------------------
my favorite first move. he responds normally. i was trying something new, so i decided to play g3 early. he opens up his knight, protecting his pawn from any threats. i get my bishop out of the way for castling. he opens up his other knight - what i would usually do. i decided to try to persuade him to take my pawn then threaten his knight repeatedly, but… …he doesn't take my pawn, but instead pushes up his pawn on the wing up two squares, something that i think is pointless. i threaten his pawn on e5 while being protected by my knight on f3 and my queen. he protects his pawn using another one of his pawns. i castle. he pushes up his pawn, same as i did on my second move. i protect my pawn with my rook. he opens up his bishop. i do this often. i fork his knight and bishop with my pawn. :d he threatens my knight, but it's easier for me to take his bishop with my pawn rather then taking the knight. i take his bishop. he takes my knight with his own, and i am now in check. i take his knight. and he takes my free pawn. but notice that the other pawn is right in front of him. now both of his e can't move anywhere. i open my knight… finally. he pushes up his pawn one square. i open up my other bishop. now both my bishops and my knight are mobile and have a fair amount of space to move around in. not a great move. it isn't doing anything except preventing him from castling, unless he wants to open up his rook. i pin the knight with my bishop. he threatens me with a pawn. and i take his knight. he takes me back. i threaten: nc7. he castles, but now i see something else, a possibility… 16. na7+ kb8 17. nc6+! forking the knight and rook! i attempt my plan… …and it works!! :d i fork his king and rook! he moves his king out of the way and i happily capture his rook. yay! he takes my knight, but now i'm plus 4 up with two rooks! i push up my pawn. and he pushes up his own. i threaten his a-pawn while being protected by my c-pawn. he ignores the threat and prepares to open up his bishop. now i'm really threatening his pawn.  but again, he ignores it! i take the pawn… …and he takes mine. …i take his… …and he doesn't take mine! now i'm planning: 25. axb6 cxb6 26. qa8+ kd7 27. bb5+ he pushes up his pawn again and now my plan can work. i take his pawn… …and he takes mine! perfect! the plan is working… yes! yes!! this is good. i check him with my queen, ignoring the queen swap. yay!!! checkmate in one move. i checkmate him with my bishop, my queen blocking his escape routes. :) believe it or not, i didn't actually checkmate him here in the blitz game. i actually played: bc4! :d but then i won his rook and he reigned. apart from not checkmating him in the blitz game, that was a great game!  
-------------------------------------
the start of queen's pawn game. i usually prefer use king's pawn game.  i didn't know how to react so i chose to try alekhine's defence on the queen side. he threatens my knight with his pawn. i obviously retreat. he protects his advanced d-pawn. i threaten his pawn, hoping to get my knight back into a position that i feel comfortable. so much for alekhine's defence. he threatens my knight with his bishop… …and i retreat, threatening his bishop. now my knight is on the other side of the board, right near to my other knight! his bishop retreats. i push up my pawn. he protects his advanced d-pawn. i open up my other knight. he opens up his bishop, preparing for: nf3 and then o-o. i open up my bishop, and i am now in a position to castle. i would prefer to play nf3. i push up knight further, looking for a gap or a free pawn. he threatens my knight and i am forced to… …retreat. he castles. i give my pawn double-protection and prepare to open up my bishop. he pushes up his pawn. i castle. he threatens my bishop while being protected by his a-pawn that he had pushed up last turn. i retreat. i don't know what he's doing here apart from placing his king right in the corner. i threaten his bishop with my knight. he retreats even further. i threaten his pawn. he takes it. the first piece has been taken! i take his pawn with my bishop. a move that will turn out to be the start of a mass-swap. i take his pawn… …and he takes mine. i take his knight… …and he takes mine. i take his bishop… …and he takes my knight with his rook who is now open. i take his pawn. and he takes back. i threaten his rook with my pawn. he retreats. i open up my bishop, giving him access to the right side of the board. he opens up his knight. i threaten his rook with my bishop. he moves out of the way. i fork the rook and the pawn. now i have at least a free pawn. he threatens my bishop. but i just take the free pawn. he threatens my pawn uselessly, due to the fact that my queen is protecting it. the first really good move. i pin his rook to his queen. he threatens my pawn, a threat that will be ignored: i take his rook. :) i am plus three up and happy with my position with an extra pawn and rook. i threaten his queen. he checks me while being protected by the queen. now i'm not a pawn up. :( i move into the corner. he moves his queen out of the way of my rook, but sill protects the bishop. i push up my pawn… and he goes straight past me. now he's two squares away from promoting! :o i threaten his pawn. he finally retreats his bishop. i retreat back to make sure promoting can't be possible. he protects his pawn, threatening: e7. forking my rook and queen! :o i put my queen in the way, halting his run. he retreats his queen. i prepare to threaten his queen with my rook, also directly threatening his rook. he moves out of the way of the threat, delivering a threat of his own on my bishop, but he doesn't see the threat on his rook.. i take his rook happily. he takes my pawn for free. my pawn can't take his knight because of the queen pinning it. i prepare for: bf2 or bc3. he checks me with his knight. suicide! i take his knight. he halts the threat of bf2 or bc3. i threaten his bishop. he moves out of the way. i threaten his queen. he retreats, obviously. i prepare to move my bishop to d4, which then allows to me to play: rg1, threatening mate. he checks me. i move to my only safe square. rh7 would result in mate for white. he retreats slightly. i check him, and his only option is: g3. his only option. i take his pawn, checking his king. his only possible move. i check him with my rook. he moves out of the way. i check him, now his options are mate in 2 for me, or a free queen for me. he chooses free queen. i move my rook out of the way - check - and after he moves his king, i am free to take his queen. i am free to take his queen! :d i take it and he resigns. :d that was such a good game! one of my highest rated players ever one against on blitz or in real games! good game vertolet! 
-------------------------------------
he uses a popular opening: king's pawn game. i respond normally. he opens up his bishop, ignoring the classic theory: 'knights before bishops'. i push up my pawn, preparing to threaten his bishop with my b-pawn. i probably should have been getting my pieces out, but, like usual, i was trying something. i still can push up my pawn, the result would would be a swapping of pawns.: b5 4. bd3 bxa4 5. rxa4. i open my knight. he opens up his queen surprisingly early, looking for 'scholar's mate', a checkmate using the bishop to protect the queen as she takes the f-pawn. 'scholar's mate' is one that beginners fall for. i will not. i open up my knight, at the same time preventing the queen from reaching my pawn. this doesn't do anything, he should be getting his pieces out. i open my bishop, and am now in a position to castle. he opens up his knight. i threaten his knight with my bishop. he moves forward, threatening my knight. i ignore the threat and prepare: be6. he threatens my bishop. i retreat. he threatens again. i retreat again. yet again, he threatens my bishop, and yet again… …i retreat. he now threatens my knight, and i'm not liking my position so much. i take his pawn with my own. and he takes mine with his bishop, he is still threatening my knight. i push up my bishop, preparing to take the free pawn. if you ask why i would sacrifice my bishop, look again at the position, at both my and my opponents rooks. he takes my knight, checking the king. i take his bishop with my pawn. he takes my bishop with his knight, checking me and i obviously… …take him. he is now in a castling position. i must have forgot about the free pawn… he pushes up his bishop. i take the free pawn with my bishop. he castles. i see something. a could pin the pawn to his queen and persuade his pawn to take one of my pieces, which would give me the queen, but how do i get to this position? i see my pawn on f6: my bait, and my pawn on c6, my barricade. now i'm thinking further. the rook and bishop connect and collide on the g2 square. he uses his rook to protect the pawn. i go for it, trying out my plan. ^^                                           00                                            v                                            - he pushes up his pawn… :o i push my queen out in case he decides to take my pawn with his queen. no matter, he is pinned to his king with my rook. but i don't see that, so i try to get rid of the pawn.  i try to get him out of the way, then i realize his g-pawn can't take me, and it can't take my pawn when i move it to f5.. this move doesn't do anything, thats what i needed, a move that doesn't threat any of my pieces or get in the way of my plan. he can take with his pawn or his queen, or he can just totally ignore it, either way, i get at least a pawn. a very bad move, but my plan worked! i take his queen, and he resigns! :d until i captured his pawn in move 15, i was worried, really worried. but, what a game! thank you for reading my sixth annotated blitz game! 
-------------------------------------
trying 'kings indian defence'. most players would usually play e5 for black, this move, e6, blocks in his bishop on c8 unless he wants to play: b6, and then: bb7. i push up my pawn, momentarily exposing his rook to a threat. he pushes up his pawn. most people do this on the other side, with: e5 d6. what some people might call 'shotgun'. pushes up his other pawn. almost sicilian. i open up my bishop early. he opens up his knight. i push up my pawn, threatening his and being protected by my pawn and bishop both. i knew he would play d4. now he has an advanced pawn, not good for me. it stops me from playing nc3. i threaten his pawn, and if he takes i will be able to open up my knight. awww! he threatens my bishop, forcing me to retreat, and protects his pawn on d4! i retreat, protecting my pawn. he pushes up his pawn. he should be opening up his pieces, preparing to castle. i push up my knight, and i am now in a castling position. not very good, this blocks his knight in, except for e7, but that blocks in his bishop. i threaten his pawn protecting his pawn. unusual, a line of three pawns. i take his pawn. and he takes back with the knight. i take his pawn… finally. he takes back. i take his knight. he takes my bishop and finally the capturing streak is over. i use my only safe square. he threatens. i castle, ignoring the threat. he threatens my rook, and he will receive the free pawn after i retreat with my rook. i retreat, threatening his pawn if he takes on a2. he takes on a2. but for some reason i don't take his pawn. now i'm not in a great position. there's my knight to worry about, and there's his queen to worry about. i protect. and he traps his bishop! i threaten his lonely bishop on c8. he threatens me, and now i can start the checking spree. check. retreats. check. retreats further. check with my knight. now he is my domain. muhaha! check. and he resigns. well, from -1 to come back and win, that was a pretty good game! 
-------------------------------------
my opponent starts with queen pawn, an opening that i found effective that day at school in a game against one of my friends. i reply, mirroring my opponent, with not much experience of how to reply, i choose the most popular reply. blocks in the black-squared bishop, not a move that i use anymore except in gambits… …like the one i am playing now. he takes my pawn. i have not yet figured out what is better: capturing or protecting, in these gambit positions in the early game. the next move of the gambit. hmmm… probably wants to prevent the double pawns on the c-file. i ignore and protect instead. uh-oh. now my pawn is being threatened by my opponents pawn, his knight, and his queen. so, naturally, i protect, also threatening the pawn with my bishop. opens up the other knight. i take the pawn, and the gambit is complete. he takes my pawn, but i am well prepared for this attack. my pawn takes back. pins my knight to king. that can be annoying. i castle, and i am now out of the pin. takes the knight with the bishop. i still don't which is worth more: knight or bishop. i take back, obviously. threatening my c-pawn. i protect my pawn and threaten his knight. protects with the pawn. i open up my bishop. bg4 is more attacking, but the queen can easily move out of the way. castles. with the f-pawn gone the king is open to diagonals and i have the e-pawn is pinned, which can come in handy. now that i look at it, i see that the d-5 pawn has enough protection. :d a nothing move, should be getting out the bishop or something. i threaten the knight, preparing for my pawn to be taken by my opponents, and then i will take back and check the king. as planned. i take the pawn and check the king. moves into the corner. i take the knight with my bishop. accepts the swap. i take back, protecting my pawn on c6. takes my bishop. doubling up rooks can be dangerous for the opponent, and i see rd1, a swap of rooks and then i will check the king. prevents my plan. i move back in order to play bb7, so if i want do something with my rook, my c-pawn will be protected. threatens the rook. i move out of the way and see that the rook and bishop could possibly meet on g2. threatens my other bishop. argh! one of my only free squares. takes the pawn and threatens my a-pawn threatens the pawn. now i see a possibility: 22. na7 ra5 or rd8, knight or bishop retreats 23. bg2. checks the king and wins a rook. my opponent sees the threat and retreats. my plan could still work. as i made my twenty-second move, i rejoiced… until my opponent moved. :( i get out of the threat and threaten the bishop. not a good move: rxd1 25. rxd1 rxe7 26. rd8 re8. but i didn't see that.  i take. takes back. obviously, but this is where i go wrong: i could have taken the free bishop. takes my knight, and messes up my pawns. i take back. pushes up a pawn. i threaten the pawn with my bishop. moves out of the way. i threaten with my rook down the a-file. threatens my bishop and pawn. i check the king with my rook. moves to the king's only free square. i take the knight. he takes back with a pawn. i check the king. king moves behind his pawns. i take the pawn. and he takes mine. i threaten the rook and protect my pawn. the rook retreats. i push up my pawn, and now i can move my king up the g-file. checks me, this does nothing, i was going to move my king anyway. i move my king in between my two pawns, i am safe for the moment. pushes up a pawn. i block my opponent's king's way of escaping into my half of the board. pushes his pawn further, he's going for a queen. i push my rook all the way to the 1st rank. his king moves away from his slightly trapped position. now, as i look at the board, i would've pushed my king to h4, but this what i played. moves his king back. i push my rook back, hoping for three-fold repetition. my opponent sees that there is no danger, and continues his run for a queen. i check the king. threatens my rook. i threaten his pawn. threatens my rook and protects his pawn. my opponent could swap pawns, but his pawn is more advanced, so it wouldn't be worth it. he pushes his rook onto the 8th rank. i check the king. moves out of the way. now its my turn to run for it… his rook is trapped unless he wants to give up his highly advance pawn. i run for it. the king is going to threat me. but i ignore it, because the threat will do nothing. threatens my rook. now, my opponent can take the rook and i get a queen. or he can swap pawns. he decides to swap pawns. i take his advance pawn. and he takes mine. now its a game of few pieces. i threaten his pawn. protects with the king. i can win the h-pawn. i threaten the h-pawn, who has no escape. so my opponent goes for a swap. i accept it. he takes my pawn. i threaten his pawn, and if he accepts another swap, then he will have a pawn and rook and i will have a rook. he checks me instead. a bad move. i will benefit from this. i take his pawn. he checks me. i retreat. threatens my pawn. i check the king. he moves out of the way. i check him again. he moves out of the way. and i check hims yet again. he moves out of the way. i protect the pawn. checks me while being protected by both king and rook. i retreat to my only possible square unless i want to lose a pawn. i would of played: kg4. i check him. moves out of the way, and now he can push up his pawn. seeing a possible pin, i move as far away as possible. as i thought. i move behind my pawn. damn! it was a weak attempt which did not succeed. now for the checking spree. check… moves out of the way. check. moves out of the way. check. moves out of the way. check.  i wanna say something different for once. but i can't think of anything else to say. moves out of the way. check! moves out of the way for the second last time! check! for the last time!! moves out of the way, and now i can swap a rook for a rook. i take his rook. he takes back. now its a game with very few pieces. i move my king toward my opponent's pawn. my opponent wants a draw, it looks like. so do i. he takes my pawn. and i take his. the last piece is off the board. now only the two kings remain. the games drawn! 
-------------------------------------
usually, d5 is the most popular reply to nf3. it lets black establish a strong pawn center. nf6 is another popular move for a symmetrical game, perhaps, for a while. but i taught my kids the dutch defense to d4 a few months ago, so let's see if he'll let me transpose into it. see, now we're playing the dutch. the dutch can lead to wild and exciting games -- that's the number one thing i'm interested in when i play chess. it's nice to win, but it's even better, for me, to have an interesting and fun game. and i'm going to use a stonewall setup. that's where there are pawns on c6, d5, e6, and f5. shock! that is not a typical move, and i didn't find it referenced in any of my books on the dutch. usually, when white plays d4, c4 openings. he keeps the tension on d5 long into the game. i wonder if he thinks he sees something to exploit. the dark bishop is extremely important in the dutch. with the pawns on all of the white squares, it's up to this bishop to protect the dark ones. it's important to be thinking about what you're going to do to cover your weaknesses in your games. he's making good moves.  i haven't made any terribly weak moves, so he's developing more pieces before trying to start an attack. that's normal in the dutch. white's knight likes to go to e5, and black's knight will go to e4. sometimes you get real wild positions if those knights are traded off and pawns recapture -- you end up with a white pawn on e5 and a black pawn on e4. it's a little easier for me to develop in this game since he's taken the pawn on e6. normally, to use this bishop, it either has to go to b7 or go to d7 then e8 and then f7 or h5. i'd been thinking about nbd7 to chase away his knight, but now i can't do it. i have to be careful of his knight moving. right now, my queen's protecting my bishop on d6, but if i put a knight on d7, then i have to watch for discovered attacks. normally, white likes to play bf4 to get rid of black's powerful bishop, and it's a good move for black to capture bxf4 and force white to recapture with gxf4; that hurts white's kingside a lot. but i'm wondering if white will play nd3 to enable him to recapture with the knight instead of the bishop. ne4 is always a good move for black in the dutch. that's sneaky! he's threatening 12. nxe4 fxe4; 13. bxe4 and my pawn on d5 is pinned because the bishop on e6 is unguarded. i thought about playing nxc3 here. that's a trap -- if he plays qxb7, i'll play nxe2+ and then qb6 (and if he plays qxa8 after that, nd7 traps his queen). this move protects both of my bishops and my pawn on b7.  what i'm nervous about is that my queen is being used to guard two pieces and a pawn. i have to watch out for combinations against her being overworked. next, i may play na6, looking at rc8 and c5 at some point. well, that surprised me a little. i was expecting him to put a rook on c1. it may be that he's anticipating my playing na6 and looking at c5, and then he would want a rook on the d-file to be hitting the pawn on d5. but i don't see any good alternatives to na6. i have to get the knight out and let my rooks get connected, and nd7 isn't an option because i lose my pawn on b7.   i looked for a while at how i might play g5 to chase off his bishop. the books i taught from showed lots of games where black's surprisingly safe when playing g5 in the dutch. i think it's because white's queen is on the queenside and diagonals to the king are blocked, so white really can't take good advantage of the move. for black, it leads to f4 at some point, and my queen and a rook and bishops and a knight are ready to attack his king if i can open it up a little.  but, for now, i can't play g5 because he can trade knights first on e5 then take the pawn with the bishop. and if i take back with the queen, he plays qxb7. but i'm going to remember that move in case i can use it still, coming up.  yeah, i thought i saw that move coming.  i can't trade on f4 because it makes his knight too powerful and i have to move my bishop to f7. that's not a bad square for it (it lets the bishop go over to h5 at the right time), but i'd rather not block my rook yet.    i looked at g5 again, but i lose a pawn after. 13 … g5; 14. nxe4 fxe4; 15. bxd6 qxd6; 16. qxb7.    i didn't find any real strong offensive moves, so i chose a defensive move that stop the qxb7 threat. now g5 becomes an option -- though i have a feeling he's planning to trade my bishop on d6 and then put the knight back on e5 even.    sometimes it's good to ask which is your worst piece, and then make plans to improve it. i don't like my knight on a6. it doesn't stop anything, and i'm not sure it threatens anything -- unless i want to play c5. i have to look at that. it threatens c4. but if he trades pawns on c5, i'm not sure that helps me, and my pawn in the center is isolated and weak. the other choices for my knight are b4, but that's not good. it chases his knight back to a better square (e5), it's easily chased away by a3 (and can only return to a6), and it's not even safe after white plays bxd6 and removes one of its defenders. so that means that the knight is going to c7. but what can it do there unless i move my other bishop and let it go to e6.   i feel like i don't have any real weaknesses, but i don't have a strong plan yet. that surprised me. i was certain he planned to trade my bishop and put his knight back on e5. i'm not sure what he's up to. this closes the position even more and makes my position even safer. his, too. so i decided to do what i'd rejected before. i'm going to trade the bishops. i'm sure he'll recapture with the knight, and i'm kind of hoping, even, that he'll trade his knight for my other bishop. in closed positions like this, knights generally have a big advantage over bishops. notice that all of pawns on white squares make both of our light bishops pretty ineffective. his hope for an advantage might be to trade his knight for my bishop, put his on h3, and then trade knights on e4. if i take back fxe4, suddenly his bishop would control an important line behind my pawns.     what i'm looking at is getting my knights to d6 and f6 (i'm guessing his other choice is to play f3 to chase mine off of its powerful post). then, if he plays ne5, i'll be able to play nf7 to challenge it.   that's a lot of knight moves, but that's the big difference between open and closed game. this is a closed game; look how there aren't any open lines and the pawns block attempts to get to the other king. in closed positions, knights are stronger because they can get past the roadblocks. also, attacks develop much more slowly. you don't have to be as concerned about rapidly developing attacks because the lines of attack just don't exist yet. in closed positions, be willing to take your time to get your pieces to the best square; don't rush your attack. that's a huge surprise to me. i felt that his knight would be very strong on f4. maybe he was worried about me playing g5, but then he'd just go back to d3 and e5.   when your opponent surprises you, think about what he's planning to do. he didn't just arbitrarily make a bad move; he has a plan in mind that i'll have to deal with. the sooner i can figure out what he's up to, the better off i'll be.   i think he's telling me that he cleared out the e-file so he can post rooks on it and dominate it. if he puts a rook on e1 and plays f3 to chase away my knight, he might be planning to put the rook on e5 and then the other one on e1. it'd be hard to withstand the pressure on my bishop.   i need to decide if i want to stay defensive and play nc7 which would support that bishop. or do i want to break open the other side with c5 while i have two knights and a queen supporting that move. this was a tough move. i was looking at nc7 and qd6. either way, i'm committed to being in a defensive position until he makes a mistake or breaks it open. what finally led me to nc7 instead of qd6 was in case he plays f3, i'm thinking that i might want to play nd6.  though it just occurred to me, now that i've made the move, that if he chase my knight to d6 and then plays qa4 (i'll play ra8), then nxc6 to trade the knight for two pawns is uncomfortable for me. i almost played bf7 here, which would've been a disaster. i was wondering if he would give up his strong knight for my last bishop - but then i saw that i lose a pawn after    19. bxe4   fxe4    20. nxe4 and my pawn on d5 is pinned and can't take it back.   instead, i'm just waiting to see what his plan is. but i'm playing black against a higher-rated opponent, so i don't mind if i can keep anything from happening and get a draw. so do i really think he's planning to play nc5? if so, he needs to get rid of my n on e4 first. would he trade the b for it? that'd be unusual -- almost admitting that white's b is as weak as black's b. i think it is in the stonewall, but that's not the common consensus. he might play f3, but that makes that bishop even weaker. perhaps he's planning to redeploy it on f1. that would chase my n back to c7. it'd be surprising to see that b traded for either n, but all of my queenside pawns become very vulnerable and weak if i let him trade on a6. no way i can let him take trade on a6. sure, i get a discovered attack with the queen, but it's just going to go to c2, and my pawn on c6 becomes way too weak -- lots of pieces can attack it, and there's no pawn that can protect it.   so after he plays f3 to chase my knight to d6 and he puts his knight on c5, i've got to figure out what i'll want to do. maybe i need to be thinking about a rook on c8, play b6 to chase the knight off of c6, and then i can play c5. but i'm sure he'll have a rook on c1 by then to stop that from happening. we'll see. i thought about trading knights, but i really don't want his queen on c5. i'm not happy with either way to guard a7. but now that my queen's on e7, i think i'd be willing to trade knights and then queens on c5. i see lots of ways for me to lose a pawn or more and no counterattacks yet. i'd like to swing my b to the other side of the pawns (though i'll have to look closer to see if there's any way it can be safe on e4 -- probably not because of be2 and f3)   if he plays bh3, i'm going to have to return to e6. i'm sure on the tightrope here. i don't like how vulnerable so many of my pieces are.  what i especially have to watch out for is if i move my knight off of e4 (like nd6 or nxc5), then i have to worry that any move from his knight on e5 (like nxc6) attacks my queen with his rook. i really don't have any choice here. now the fun starts, but i can tell i'm not going to be happy with it. by the time we're done, he'll have two minor pieces compared to my extra rook. the problem is that in this closed position, the rooks don't have as much scope as a bishop and extra knight. i think i'd rather be in his position. pretty. it looks like he has a nice, little mate-in-two set up after i take the knight. well, not really a forced mate, i can trade my q for his b to postpone it. such a deal! yeah, i knew he saw this before he played ng6+. time to move on to the next game. 
-------------------------------------
a first mistake. i think 10. bxc3 was better. now, after 10... ba5 black's bishop will excert pressure on the c3 pawn, which will furthermore be pinned after white play re1.   un primer error. era mejor 10. axc3, pues después de 10... aa5 el alfil negro ejercerá presión sobre el peón de c3, que además quedará clavado después de que el blanco juegue te1. although it is dificult to evaluate this move, the original idea was to consolidate the center and eventuall play d4 and cxd4. as will become obvious in what follows, this plan will actually be very hard for white to carry out. as a result, the d3 pawn now becomes a serious weakness for white.  aunque es difícil evaluar esta jugada, la idea original era consolidar el centro con esta jugada y seguir con un eventual d4 y cxd4. como se verá en la partida, llevar a cabo este plan le costará al blanco mucho más trabajo del que anticipaba; en consecuencia, ahora el peón de d3 habrá de ser una debilidad constante en la posición del blanco.  white has not been able to play d4 and so with this move white changes his plan. the idea now is 22. nh3, 23. f4 and 24. nf2 with the intention to bring support to the d3 pawn.  el blanco no ha podido jugar d4 y debe de cambiar de plan. esta jugada tiene la idea de 22. ch3, 23. f4, y 24. cf2, brindando apoyo al peón de d3. black responds energetically to white intention of consolidating the center.  el negro por su parte reacciona con energía ante el plan del blanco de consolidar su centro. it seem to me this is the only alternative. after 26. qxc5 nxb5 27. qxe5 a4 and after 28. qc5 white will be constantly troubled by black's pawns on the queenside. it is unclear whether white will eventually be able to stop them.  la única alternativa. después de 26. dxc5 cxb5 27. dxe5 a4 28. dc5 el blanco tendrá la constante preocupación de detener los peones pasados y ligados del negro, y en realidad no es claro que pueda siquiera lograrlo. there is no alternative since after 28... rxd3? 29. rxd3 qxd3 30. qxc6 white's b pawn becomes unstoppable.  después de 28... txd3? 29. txd3 dxd3 30. dxc6 el peón pasado de las blancas se vuelve una amenaza mortal. a serious mistake. with this move the black rook on d6 is suddenly left pinned and white automatically gains two tempi. with these, white can now play 30. nd2 and 31. nc4, winning the a5 pawn without black beng able to defend it.  un grave error. con esta jugada la torre de d6 queda clavada y el negro le regala dos tiempos al blanco. con ello el blanco puede jugar 30. cd2 y 31. cc4 y ganar el peón de a5 sin que el negro pueda oponer resistencia. another mistake, since now white will take the black pawn on c6 and his b pawn becomes unstoppable. although passive, 33... rd6 was necessary.   otro error, pueas ahora el blanco tomará el peón de c6 y su peón de b6 se volverá imparable. aunque pasiva, era indispensable jugar 33... td6.  this move allows white to win instantly but there were not many alternatives. if black plays 35... ke7 [36... kf7 37. qd5   -] 36- b7 nd5 (intending 37... qf3 ), then 36. qc7  follows.  esta jugada le permite al blanco ganar de inmediato, pero no había ya muchas alternativas. si el negro hubiera jugado 35... re7 [36... rf7 37. dd5   -] 36. b7 cd5 (con idea de 37... df3 ), entonces sigue 37. dc7 .  the black queen is pinned and so there is no defense against b8=d. black resigns.  la dama negra está clavada y por lo mismo no hay manera de evitar b8=d. las negras abandonan. 
-------------------------------------
gledaj, ovako napadaju samo početnici koji su naučili da treba napadati polje f7 i samo su na to skoncentrisani. zato redovo upadaju u zamke, zaostaju u razvoju i nema više nikakve šanse da se odbrane.  crni razvija svoje figure i izaziva belog na privlačno polje g5. beli je zagrizao mamac. ovo je sad forsirano. beli nema bolji potez nego da uzme pešaka. crni preuzima inicijativu. svaka nebranjena figura na tabli je poziv protivniku da preuzme inicijativu forsiranjem igre. šah izgleda kao najlogičnije rešenje za belog. ovo je novi mamac na udici. beli ima priliku da zadrži pešaka više i usput potpuno rasturi pešačku strukturu crnog na toj strani.  sve ovo izgleda belom kao veoma opasan napad. ovo je ključni momenat zamke. belom najprivlačnije i najlogičnije izgleda potez ba4. mogućnost da se uzme pešak c6 i viljuškom napadne kralj i top deluje zaslepljujuće na belog. samo treba oterati crnog konja i eto....ništa lakše od toga. ( : beli nastavlja sa realizacijom svog genijalnog plana da uzme topa. samo mu još taj konj smeta, ali najuriće ga on. ima vremena. ovo je samo malo odlaganje plana. još uvek ima vremena na pretek. crni postaje malo dosadan sa ovim pešacima.  sad je beli prividno povratio inicijativu i napao još opasnije pešaka c6 beli je ustvari nateran na ovaj potez. jedina alternativa tom potezu bilo bi vraćanje konja na početnu poziciju. odluka o tome koji je od ova dva poteza bolji je veoma laka za belog. grom iz vedra neba. istovremeni napad na dve figure.  ako - 11. nxc6  qxa4     12. nxa5  qxa5 ako - 11. bxc6  nxc6     12.  nxc6  qd5   13. nxa7 bg4  14. nc3  qh5  15. ne2  rxa7 bilo koji od ova dva poteza belog vodi u poraz. zato je najbolji nastavak za belog  ovo što sledi...... >  beli je napokon dočekao priliku da ostvari svoj plan i napadne tog konja koji mu smeta. ali iznenađenjima nikad kraja. crni bi dobio ovu partiju i potezom - 12. ba6 koji je možda i bolji, ali ja volim da pojednostavljujem stvari i ovo je sasvim solidna igra. napokon je beli dočekao da uzme tog topa.  ( : treba samo biti dovoljno uporan. opet problemi. ) : sad beli lovac nema gde da pobegne. šah je igra puna iznenađenja. jasno je ko dobija ovu partiju i i dalja analiza je nepotrebna. od 12og poteza ova partija se mogla razvijati u nekoliko pravaca. nije moralo baš ovako, ali to je sad preširoka analiza. u svakom slučaju crni drži sve konce u svojim rukama i pobeda ne dolazi u pitanje. gotovo sva otvaranja kriju ovakve ili slične zamke. zato je potrebno polako učiti te varijante. ono što je za decu tablica množenja, to su za šahiste varijante u otvaranju. uz pomoć game db to može veoma brzo da se nauči kao pesmica. ja takvu mogućnost nisam imao kada sam učio šah.   
-------------------------------------
this is a game which i played for a mini-tournament. it's the second game with the specific player. i lost the first game making a lot of mistakes and my opponent took advantage of them, winning easily the game. when i lost the first game i decided to concentrate to this game and don't make (a lot of) mistakes. i was playing carefully and with respect to my opponent. this game hasn't well-organized strategies and divine moves. i annotate this so you can see how emotions can destroy a game... it was a great lesson i took and i wanted to make it public. sicilian defense. even i don't use it a lot, i believed that it would help me develop without problems. i believe, looking the whole game, that e6 was better move in order to open my bishop, castle and prevent the knight claiming the d5 square (which destroyed me).   ??? was it mistake? nd4 is obviously ready to go to the graveyard and white didn't do anything to protect it. i thought a lot for the next move in case white had a plan. my opponent said that he didn't do this on purpose. it was simply a mistake which everyone has done at these low-respected games. i didn't find something that could cause me problems so...  exd4. here is the key to my defeat. after this move white had 4 options for his knight. 2 going back, 1 going to a4 and do nothing and 1 going ahead to d5. so this move was really natural to me and i wasn't surprised at all.  expected... and here is my crash. after taking the knight all were easier. i had only to attack, and using the queen was the proper way. it was the second time in the game that his knight couldn't move to prevent a second strike to his pieces: c3 was unavailable.   so there was only one solution... in this move i felt winner without happening in fact anything that could lead to victory. i was so happy with the idea that i would send another piece to the graveyard that i forgot completely my defense. c7 was barely protected now and with my next move everything was going down. i repeat that staying white knight in d5 was the result of the pressure of the d4 pawn. everything was going allright ?!?!?!?!?! and now what? gr8m8 had only one move to do and he did it. the funny thing is that when i closed the pc i strongly believed that the opponent would soon resign after losing two pieces! but... knight threatens my king, my queen and my rook. when i saw this i was really angry with myself and i wanted to smash the computer. it wasn't the loss of the queen that made me furious but my blindness. there are some emotional rules which everyone must keep in order to play without unpleasant surprises. even if you know playing chess masterfully if you underestimate your opponent (which i did after 7... exd4) weaknesses are expected. i believed that i won without doing something to prove this. also, after 7... exd4 and 8... qa5  i never looked back. i didn't pay attention to the heavy weaknesses. knight and bishop were not for me attacking pieces. ι believe that everyone had this problem sometime. he underestimated his opponent just because he thought that he was in a superior position. in the end that was only a fake idea. you may say that 10. nc7  was obvious and i was just careless but i think that you did it too sometimes in the past and it wasn't obvious for you then. that's all folks. i hope you enjoyed the crash of my arrogance... thank you for watching this game... :-) 
-------------------------------------
also die partie ist von tricks geprägt und ja mal gucken was passiert ist. der spielt mir ja nach jetzt weicht er ab sd7 gefällt ihm wohl nicht. weg mit dir ,laüfer lauf bauer, hier ist schon der erste taktische ansatz zu sehen. aber der bauer ist leider wieder weg  wollte er nicht nehmen? find ich gut!!! meint der er gewinnt was? find ich gut! der springer lebt wieder dame weg ok jetzt ist die partie entschieden wieder ne figur da hängt ja fast alles er hat sich für das matt entschieden 
-------------------------------------
  i dont see any threat with this, should be just in oreder to castle. so i have a free tempo to devlop but first i whant to repulse the queen-side 's wite center occupation whith b7 b5. it is not very good but i dont know what to do ...will it be the bigining of the end for blacks ? maybe..., maybe not ! i still have a tempo ! in order to pin the f3 knight. my plan is this : brcause anyway i know that i will die, i whant to have some fun playing more agressvely, so i diced to intent a bishop sacrifice 9. ...bd2  10....qc1   11...bg4   12.h2/h3 g4xh3 13.g2xh3  qxh3!   of course this is too long to prepare and to easy to anticipate for such a good player like my oponent. but it will be fun anyway ! remenber that this is just a blitz . for themoment i dont care about this rook plan n°1 ... no direct threat, i dont care ! plan n°2 ... (oponent should now know what i will intent) ho ! i forgot this poor little pawn ! plan n°3... i fell so sad, it doesnt work ! and i'm now missing a paw and he is going to push the center and surely try to have a advanced paw, this happen very often whith good oponents in way to pu it in c5 to stop the c4 paw progression and maybe to do all a mess in white camp from c5 (?) preparing to cancel the pin pressure, but it seems no thing more !  i still dont realize it, but this knight is a very good move that will make me surprisely win this game yes ! this is the wining move ! the queen has to move, but where ? now the c5 knight will start his good job going to e4, nc3xe4 nf6xe4 and thea1 rook is threatened ... ! ! not enought, first ne4 c3, the queen have to move then i take with the same knight the e2 bishop, the queen has to take it an so i win the d4 knight ! first second third ! i'm know +2 and it is not finished ... bad : i will take the a1 rook and he will take my f8 rook, but my king will take back the white bishop, bad calcul from oponent win the rook loose the rook (so same level) but i win the bishop ! now i'm +5, the game could go on, but white resign.  
-------------------------------------
dragon !!! cg5 !! con idea de eliminar el alfil que vendrà a  ah6 sacandolo de la diagonal cd5 !! controlando el centro del tablero !! muy buena jugada que le da mas iniciativa a las blancas centro del tablero absolutamente controlado por las blancas quitando del camino piezas peligrosas bloqueando diagonal jugada dudosa que permite el desarrollo del alfil blanco en direccion al flanco rey con ae3 !! desarrolando mis piezas poco a poco las blancas tienen mucha iniciativa y hay que hacer algo para parar su ataque jugada preventiva caballo en medio juego controlando el centro no lo puedo permitir.
-------------------------------------
stronger seems nh5. if i don't want to take the bishop back, i go bg3, accepting the exchange to use the h file.  now i can save the bishop, just in case. it is not regarded as good.  i don't want to push the center, nor with e4, nor with c4.  this knight here is not so useful as it seems. but his twin will become black's more active piece.  just to avoid to support the knight with the bishop.  preparing to support the knight.  indirectly looking for protecting the knight.  accepted. now, he has to take it, and i don't bother at all to lose my inactive n. surprise. i want to connect the rooks asap :-) sweating, since i knew what was coming. i won't take it. it will only favour him.  oh, yes, i know where are you aiming at.  better was the othe pawn, h5. anyway, the issue is to surprise him (with not that bad moves). interesting, but i can't see the advantage black has with these exchanges.  it seems logical to prepare it first.  opening the po(i)sition for me? thank you! i have to "take" those black diagonals. my queen must come into the game. f6 was impossible because of rxg6+, hxr, qxg6+, kh8, nf5 and i win. now, bxg6, fxb, rxg6+, hxr, qxg6+, kh8, bxn+, winning. but i saw another good move, thinking it was definitive. i was wrong.  desperate defence, since i can play straight away qxn. of course it was a blunder, since ne8 would have worked much better. anyway, the bxg6 sac would have worked all the same. forced or mate.  now black can defend on the 7º row, so there is still a game to play. anyway, white threats nxn and bxg6, so black is kind of forced to play  nxn, rxn, rc7, rh-g1 and white gets enough firepower to win. my opponent resigned.  
-------------------------------------
 this is a training game of team synergie. sorry, annotations in german language only. arabsalam: "ich möchte meine weitere bauernstruktur (e6-e5, c6-5) immer noch nicht festlegen und entwickle eine figur. der positive aspekt bei sbd7 ist, daß er nach e5 schaut, negativ, daß nun dd8 und lc8 versperrt sind." vorbereitung von e4, rochade kann jederzeit erfolgen. (arabsalam) mit e5 habe ich ein ideales bauernzentrum und etwas raumvorteil in der mitte erreicht. die stellung sollte ausgeglichen sprich der weiße anzugsvorteil neutralisiert sein. (arabsalam) um zu rochieren muss ich meinen lf8 entwickeln.
-------------------------------------
 2) ld6 überdeckt e5, so daß auf lg5 einfach h6 folgen kann (und lxf6 sxf6). nachteilig ist die fehlende perspektive auf dieser ldiagonale richtung königsflügel (g3!). zudem verstopfen jetzt ld6 und sd7 die d-strasse.
-------------------------------------
 3) lc5, für das ich mich entscheide, sieht optisch sicher am überzeugendsten aus, vor allem die diagonale a7-f2 ist so viel schöner als c7-d5 bei ld6. allerdings hat er auch den nachteil, dass er eine bestimmte abwicklung zulässt (brulla) kontrolle über e4. (arabsalam) könig raus aus der mitte (brulla) damit ist der standardaufbau des kia erreicht. (arabsalam) mit c6 festige ich das feld d5 und öffne die d8-a5 diagonale für meine dame. (brulla) es starten die zentrumsaktivitäten: feld d5, e-linie usw.
-------------------------------------
  (arabsalam) cxd5 und mein bauernzentrum bleibt erhalten. mein plan ist es das zentrum zu halten und demnächst den lc8 ins spiel zu bringen (brulla) so, der turm macht nun druck auf der e-linie. klar, du willst deinen läufer entwickeln, also muss ich dich beschäftigen, damit du das nicht realisieren kannst. falls du den läufer über b7 entwickeln willst halte ich mal ausschau nach kleinen gemeinheiten über die lange diagonale. (arabsalam) tatsächlich bindet te1 meinen sd7 an die deckung von e5 und mein vorhaben, etwas für den lc8 zu tun rückt in weitere ferne. andererseits ist das noch nicht so dramatisch, weil es um deinen lc1 augenblicklich nicht besser steht. sollte ich den lc8 einmal entwickeln können, geschähe das eher nach f5 oder g4 als nach b7. 
-------------------------------------
 te1 hat aber auch einen nachteil, denn jetzt deckt nur noch der kg1 den bauern f2. mein nächster zug macht sich das zunutze.
-------------------------------------
 (brulla) außerdem schaut deine dame nun nach b2.  (arabsalam) sb4 gibt es nicht, aber sg4: 
-------------------------------------
 das attackiert f2 (und deckt e5) und forciert tf1, womit dieser wieder auf seinem ausgangsfeld landet und die e-linie räumen muß. andererseits ist fraglich, wo mein sg4 hin soll, wenn du h3 spielst. auch bleibt mein lc8 immer noch beerdigt. (brulla) richtig! diesen "tanzschritt" mit dem turm hätte ich mir sparen können, wenn ich gleich 9.qe2 gezogen hätte. wieder was gelernt! :) (arabsalam) du sagst es, tanzschritt, ein schritt nach vorn, einer zurück, und nicht nur dein tf1e1, sondern auch wahrsch. mein sf6g4f6 (wenn du h3 spielst), mit dem unterschied, daß ich den "sidestep" f5 einschiebe und so ein wichtiges tempo im zentrum gewinne. nach f5 ist für s in solchen stellungen oft die diagonale g8-a2 ein problem. in dieser konkreten stellung ist das aber nicht der fall, weil da erstmal keine w figuren hinkommen. nach 12...sf6 oder später steht mein sf6 hinter dem f-bauern und nicht vor ihm, ich denke, das ist eine bedeutende verbesserung meiner position. ich sollte hier mindestens gleiches spiel haben, und das ist wahrscheinlich eine pessimistische schätzung.  (arabsalam) sf6 ist hier der einzige zug und sh6 keine alternative (brulla) alles nachvollziehbar. ich versuche jetzt, meine figuren, insbesondere den läufer c1 und den springer f3 ins spiel zu bringen. damit könnte auch mein läufer g2 platz bekommen. (arabsalam) sb3 gegen lc5 wäre ein schlechter tausch für mich, denke ich, daher ld6 (brulla) 14...e4 ist ein guter "dominierungszug". ich war erst versucht, 15.nfd2 zu spielen, aber dann fielen mir die schwarzfeldrigen diagonalen auf. dxe4 kam für mich nicht in frage, da ich deinen springer nicht auf e4 haben will! wie gut, dass deine bauern auf den linien c und e schon "vorbei" sind. (arabsalam) mit meinem nächsten zug zentralisiere ich meinen sd7 und befreie endlich den lc8 aus seinem kerker. anders als läufer sind im mittelspiel springer im zentrum am stärksten positioniert. nachdem ich die zentrumsfelder dominiere, bin ich nun bestrebt zentrumsnahe felder wie f3, d3 oder c4 zu erobern sowie die c-linie mit meiner artillerie zu bestücken. (arabsalam) einziger sinnvoller zug hier (arabsalam) fxe ist besser als dxe weil es dem lc8 und tf6 die diagonale bzw linie öffnet und zudem die kontrolle über das feld c4 (via d5) erhalten bleibt. (brulla) ziel: raumgewinn am damenflügel. etwas sorge macht mir deine beherrschung des feldes f3....mein springer d4 steht zwar gut, weg darf er aber von sich aus auch nicht. (arabsalam) a4 gefällt mir sehr, nachdem du im zentrum und königsflügel beengt stehst, versucht du am damenflügel vor allem mit unterstützung der d4-b3 kavallerie druck zu machen. mit a6 oder ld7 könnte ich jetzt gegenmaßnahmen ergreifen und meine position weiterverstärken. aber am königsflügel kann ich mit einer taktischen abwicklung das spiel verschärfen (arabsalam) der vorführeffekt hat mich erwischt, dh5 hatte ich gar nicht auf dem schirm, meine taktische abwicklung ist nach hinten losgegangen. anstatt 18...sf3 ? hätte ich mit dem ruhigen ld7 meine position verstärken müssen. jetzt stehe ich ziemlich blöd da. (brulla) insbesondere auf meine springer bin ich ziemlich stolz. aber "die messe ist noch nicht gelesen", jetzt kommt die große frage: wie weiter? ich will mal eine weitere figur aktivieren. da scheint immer noch einiges an taktik drin zu sein.
-------------------------------------
  (arabsalam) jetzt kommt leider verspätet ld7. *** (arabsalam) viele felder hat meine dame ja nicht. c7 ist oft ein gutes feld für sie, vor allem wenn die linie halboffen ist und nicht etwa tc1 sie direkt wieder vertreiben kann. zudem kann nicht sb5 kommen, was auch unangenehm wäre. desweiteren verstärke ich die diagonale b8-h2. (arabsalam) mit lxg3 zerschlage ich jetzt den bauernwall um deinen könig. wenn man es abzählt, sind es nur deine dh5 und der sd4, die deinen könig beschützen (f3 u h3), während meine beiden läufer, der turm und die dame deinen königsflügel anstrahlen. die verwicklungen habe ich nicht durchgerechnet, ich opfere aus strategischen erwägungen heraus.
-------------------------------------
even if i have lost the game in a deplorable way, i think that this is one of my most interesting games for the rich tactic possibilities in the midgame.  black makes very questionable choices in a very tense situation, and finally loses, but... was the sac sound? could black have survived or even won? if you can provide an answer, i would appreciate you to do so.  my favourite, the scandinavian.  the "second" best move, perfectly playable.  i can't conceive to play this opening with the lsb into the pawn's chain, but i know it is playable and even considered better. not very recommendable, but not disatrous (imo). another option is nc6. this move deprives the knight of a good square, but it can go to d7 anyway, and it is not badly placed.  white didn't lose a tempo, since my best option will be to play c5, sooner or later, so c6 would have been a loss of tempo.  this is obviously in order to play c5 (avoiding the bishop's check). black has not a wonderful game, but its objectives are clear: to catch up in developement, and there are only few ways to do it. and it is very difficult for white to avoid it.  a promising procedure for white is g4, f4... a quick expansion on the kingside. i am prepared to cope with it, anyway.  ...and this is in order to keep the lsb in case of nh5. this will happen if the black queen wants to go to the kingside. ok, too many pawn's move in the opening, but the position is still solid.  now black's queenside developement is assured. another pawn's move... white sees no quick attack (c4!?). he is somewhat threatening ba6, if this can be considered instead of be3.  thank you for the tempo, white.  ah, ok, white's plan is to play slowly, building a fortress with pawns. ok.  let's push them, then. my kingside is blocked, but the game is on the queenside, and my dsb is acting from its very spot, as long as the bg8 knight is patient.  piling a futile defence, since e5 is invulnerable in most lines.  this move adds pressure on the black diagonal, specially d4. since i cannot develop my other pieces, i do it with my queen.  thematic. black cannot afford bxb, since my strenght is the pawn chain.  depriving d4 of one of its defenders.  adding another one. tension is building, but for white dxc5 is not good.  the idea is to keep the pressure on d4. in this opening, i know my white bishop will be exchanged, eventually, so i decide to exchange it before nb1 goes to d2 and makes the exchange useless.  now i can take the pawn and give some air to my dsb.  by taking back the pawn with c3xd4, the natural move, i'd have a little countergame with nb4, threatening kc2 forking the rooks or to exchange the white's lsb. with bxd4, i could develop my bishop in c4.   but now the firework starts. this seems to be bad, since i am helping white's developement. but if bc5, b5!, so i am somewhat forced. i can't delay my developement any further.  nxc3 would have been better, even if black had countermoves, like nd4, or bc5, or bb4.  finally developing the dsb. black is catching up in developement very quickly, as it often happens in the scandinavian.  threatening b4, kicking my bishop, that could have gone to d4, etc. but i started to think about some tactic... now i have to be very careful, since the queen is x-raying my rook (with check!).  with a nasty fork threat on c6.  oooohhhhh!....:-))) this was my plan from the bc5 move. it protects c6 and the queen must abandon the support of the white diagonal. i knew it has a very nice place to go to... this one. note that the knight is threatened, as is the g7 pawn. but i considered that the pawn was poisoned. on purpose, i afford to have two free pieces under attack, plus a weak spot. he has only the dsb uner threat. but in chess you have only one move at a time... this was my bet. if the queen leaves, bxf2+. no problem if white goes bxr, since it gives me a tempo i can use for a lot of nice things, like pushing the pawn to c2! not enough to win, but still threatening.  now: is bxf2+ enough to go for it? remember the white queen can be on g7, threatening the rook and then the knight with check.  of course, qxn is also possible, but then bxf2+ is still there.  a rook is gone (but material is equal!), and i cannot go bxf2+. and i still have two problems: the knight and the pawn. but i had a trick in my sleeve... or at least i thought so.  oooooooohhhhhh!!! if qxn, bxf2+ and then i can take the rook... but i wouldn't! i need the bishop to be ready to come back to d4 in order to threaten the queen and save the rook. then, i'm threatening c2, winning the knight or the rook a1.     se la donna bianca mangia in g4, tra lo scacco in f2, con minaccia alla torre, e il fatto che anche se il bianco prende in g7 c'� sempre ad4, o addirittura lasciare che si mangi la torre e magari c'� compensazione sufficiente data la posizione esposta del re bianco e la minaccia del pedone della colonna c... in alcune varianti, poi, il cavallo g8, messo in f6, difeso dal re in e7 o dall'alfiere in d4, che tra l'altro minaccia la torre a1, con la minaccia tg8... vertigini.  avrebbe rischiato il bianco??? !? white smells danger, and prefer to defend than to take! this was a kind of psychological victory, but see...     non ha rischiato! star� vincendo?  my god, che posizione complicata! per la mossa 20 ci ho messo non so quanto e ho studiato mille possibilit�. il problema � salvare il cavallo g5 senza portarlo indieto a f6, il che non si pu� per donna x g8. anche se poi ad4 salva la torre, non � simpatico farsi mangiare un'altro pedone. allora, questo � il trucco. facciamo andare avanti il pedone, in f2. qui abbiamo:  1) dxc. allora alfiere d4 e con la minaccia alla torre ha tempo di coprire g7. qua il bianco o salva la torre o salva il cavallo, e io recupero il mio pezzo.  il problema resta sempre: c'� compensazione per la qualit� persa se salva il cavallo? per esempio su f7? 2) cc3 o d2.  in queste due, il tema consiste nel far ritirare l'alfiere bianco a f3, e poi con l'alfiere minacciare la dama, e h2.  se il cavallo muove in d2, non vale ad4 perch� mi cede la torre per i miei due pezzi.  quindi devo muovere cg8-f6, perch� il punto g2 diventa veramente vulnerabile con il cavallo in f6. il problema � h2-h3, devo ritirare il cavallo.  posso fare arrocco, per minacciare l'alfiere.  posso togliere il re, per minacciare l'alfiere lasciando per� la torre in h pensando eventualmente un colpo tattico con a5 in risposta ad h3, per aprire l'azione della torre sulla colonna h, con effetti almeno spaventosi, se non reali, minimo di patta per scacco perpetuo! posso provare con ad4,  e posso provare con ad6.  tra le due, mi fa pi� paura la seconda perch� se non si chiude la dama, questa dopo ad6 fugge a c3, minacciando uno scomodo scacco in c8. ma si pu� arroccare, non salvando quindi il cavallo in g4, ma minacciando l'alfiere a1. insomma, se sto a spiegare tutto, scrivo un libro. bd4 allowed qxn (now white can afford it) but threatened c2. i'm not sure i should have played it now. if bd4, white can go simply ra2, and i have troubles to progress. but see: after 20... bd4, 21. ra2, ng8-f6, defending my knight and keeping the pressure on f2.  i'm not sure the text move was the right one.  a kind of mistake, since it allows... if now qxn, i can consider even ng8-f6. if the queen takes g7, ne4 forces it to go away, and i am the one who is threatening a free piece. if qg4, bxf2+, kh1, nxn.   alla fine, forse era meglio per le bianche dxg4, e anche qui dovevo decidere se rispondere la "semplice" 22. axc3, tc1, 23. cf6! e a dxg7 rispondere con 24. ce4 o tg8, entrambe complicatissime, o spingere ancora di pi� sul tattico con 22. cf6 e pi� o meno lo stesso tema di prima, con esito non chiaro!   white is defending, and now my c pawn seems to be lost.  i can consider 22... ne3, and if 23. fxn, bxe3+ forks the rook. but after 24. kh1, bxr, 25. rxb,  i am still losing the exchange. anyway, i had the resource ke7.  if white 26. qxg7, nf6, and the knight is ready to jump to g4, threatening the check in f2 (27. qxr, ng4, 28. qg8, nxf2, and white has to defend from nd3+, since if 29. rxc2, nd3+ (discovered), 30. kh1, and black has at least nf2+, 31. rxn, bxn, and white cannote go 32. rxb, because of qxrf2, threatening mate...   should i have gone for it? in such a situation, a white had a lot of alternate moves, and it was beyond my ability to analyze all of them.  the white moves makes me lose the c pawn, but allows me a very precious tempo.     due possibilit�: o ce3, e se f2xe3, axe3 , rh1 (ma anche tf2), axc1, e la donna bianca non pu� prendere in g7 per la potente sorpresa df2!!, con minaccia di matto che fa strage, insieme al pedone. per�, se non prende in g7 e semplicemente mette la torre in c1... le nere sono senza mosse buone. a dd4 segue un mondo di varianti, troppo incerte per poterci contare, con possibilit� tattiche impressionanti per entrambi. lo scacco in b8 ha un finale felice per le bianche, o devono rimanere con la patta per scacco perpetuo? e se invece non vanno in b8 ma txc7, le nere hanno compensazione? 2) cg8-f6. se h2-h3, ce5, e se ora dxg7, cg8!, minacciando lo scacco di cavallo che lascia scoperta la regina. ma se non prende in g8? le varianti sono un sacco, ed analizzare questa posizione � molto, molto difficile per me... 3) axc3... e qui due mondi diversi: dxc3, con una doppia minaccia in c8 o g7, che per� ha la contromossa cg8-e7!?, che tappa sia l'alfiere sia la dama per lo scacco sulla diagonale bianca. e se dxg7, tg8 � addirittura favorevole per le nere, con un gioco tattico complicatissimo ma che il nero vince se riesce a portare il cavallo in d3, nonostante gli scacchi di alfiere e dama. difficile per� analizzare tutte le varianti del bianco. ma c'� anche la semplice dxcg4. axc3, poi txc7, non sembra dare sufficiente compensazione alle nere, per cui si pu� pensare a cg8-f6, ma anche l� non vedo molte uscite. dxg7, ce4, e dovunque si ritiri la donna c'� la minaccia cd2 che incombe, anche qui con gioco complicatissimo. oppure: dxg7, tg8, dxh6, cg4, dh4, af6, dh3, ae4 o th8 e le nere hanno un attacco potentissimo. c'� anche la trappola dxg7, tg8, dxh6, cg4, e se dh6 direttamente, db1!! e per il matto in h2 non pu� prendere l'alfiere, e poi vince.  ma c'� da fidarsi di quest'analisi??? se, per esempio, invece di prendere g7, si limita a ritirare la donna... vale ancora la pena per il nero?  si potrebbe scommettere che prender� l'alfiere, in quanto sembra valere pi� del cavallo?  now the center is completely mine, and i can harass the white queen.  ?? a losing move. the right one was among be5 (q goes away then nxh2), or... o-o!! incredible but true. i threaten the bishop, at the moment.  if 23... be5, the queen must go, but if qxg7, ne4 wins a piece, and h2 is still threatened.    grande e definitivo errore del nero, cio� mio.  la mossa giusta era arrocco. o ae5.  il fatto � che mi sono perso riguardando tutte le possibili varianti, tra sacrifici, prese pericolose della donna bianca in g7 (che in molti varianti giocava a mio favore, per esempio se il mio cavallo andava in e5 e dopo dxg7, togliendo il cf6 c'era la minaccia cf3 !, vincendo la donna anche se questa avesse preso intanto la torre h8... d'altra parte, le nere possono giocare con la ritirata ae4, la presa in h2, sia di cavallo che di alfiere, con tutt i problemi tattici che ne derivano... insomma, un mondo...).  sono giunto alla conclusione che potevo farla. del resto, minacciava l'alfiere.  qua le reazioni potevano essere sia ritirare l'alfiere, sia minacciare il cavallo con h3, ed in entrambi i casi il gioco che ne sorge � molto tattico e pericoloso per entrambi.  per esempio, se ritira l'alfiere a f3, con ae5 inizio un gioco ricco che prevede, in alcune varianti, la perdita della donna bianca, e comunque la presa in h2... se � che poi questa mi da veramente qualche vantaggio, cosa non da poco da decidere...  e non dimentichiamo 24. cd5! figuriamoci se uno come me non la vede! e anche qua le analisi, varianti dei temi precedenti, mi sono sembrate a mio favore... sbagliando!, ma con anche molte varianti in cui erano le nere a rimanere con vantaggio materiale!  e non ho pensato che comunque gran parte di tutte quelle analisi, e di tutti quei rischi, erano inutili, potendo semplicemente arroccare con lo stesso effetto di minacciare l'alfiere a8!  il fatto � che avevo cominciato tutto questo discorso con l'idea di vedere se re7 fosse un'alternativa all'arrocco, se mai. siccome si � complicata troppo, l'ho presa come l'unica mossa da considerare, mi sono dimenticato che era solo un ramo dell'analisi.   evvabb�, succede!  per� ho perso la partita, per quello. perch� non avevo considerato nella sua giust white countersacs in great fashion, and wins! e5xn was risky because of the rook checks. this is the reason o-o would have been better! seeing what is coming up, i decide to exchange my way... but it was a mistake.  ?? qxf2+, qxq, nxq, kxn, exb, and the game would have been playable, but i made the wrong move again, overwhelmend with all the lines i analyzed the moves before, i didn't see the obvious... still, kf6, and if qxn+, qxq+, kxq, exb, and the game is still playable.  black loses.  now i realize i am lost... to be noted: with o-o all this could have been avoided.   questa era la mossa che ho sottovalutato. forse ho analizzato soltanto adesso che se ce4 , txd, cxd, c'era da perdere per lo scacco in tb8 , e se ch3  , rf1 salvava il bianco (anche se dg1 , re2 e le nere non possono pi� continuare l'attacco, e perdono).   il tipico "oh oh" del coyote quando si accorge di essere oltre l'orlo del precipizio!!!!!! nh3++, kf1, qg1+, ke2, leaves me with the threat rb8+ to cope with, and white wins the knight (as a minimum).  if ne4+, rxq, nxq, rb8+ also wins.  the game is lost. but... could i have won this?   abbiamo visto che gli scacchi di scoperta non funzionano! sono morto... gli ho dato il gusto di continuare, proprio perch� se lo meritava.  la gran domanda: avrei potuto vincere? ho sbagliato anche prima del mancato arrocco? very good game, white... :-( 
-------------------------------------
una bella vittoria, in una posizione interessante e ricca di varianti tattiche. opzione un po' strana da parte delle bianche, ma forse volevano squilibrarmi. la presa dell'alfiere in un certo senso le aiuta ad occupare il centro, ma non sono un problema per le nere. in questo modo, lascio il campo libero a c4, ma comunque ho gi� rinunciato ad arroccare di donna, quindi mi posso occupare con calma di proteggermi sul fianco di donna.  l'idea � quella di giocare c6 e poi sistemare l'alfiere in c7, che � sempre una formazione simpatica e solida.  questo cavallo non pu� andare da nessuna parte, penso che sarebbe stato meglio metterlo in e2... ma sono cose molto incerte.  gli rid� posto per il cavallo, ma prendo l'iniziativa. gi� che ci siamo, restringiamo un po' i movimenti delle bianche sul lato di donna.  comincio ad avere qualche bel pensierino sul lato di re bianco, nonostante il problema dello sviluppo.  sto gi� pensando a g5... beh, non potevo sperare tanta passivit� delle bianche... non volevo autobloccarmi con g6, ma anche questa mossa ha i suoi inconvenienti... restringendo il possibile blocco bianco in e5. certo, che sto lasciando indietro lo sviluppo dei miei pezzi, e anche un brutto "buco" in e7, che in effetti mi da dato non pochi grattacapi. bellissima mossa, che non avevo previsto. stavo gi� pensando a g5-g4 e una quasi-vittoria, quando mi sono trovato in difficolt�. adesso s� che era obbligatoria g6, e la mia posizione diventa traballante. per fortuna non pu� fare g3 perch� prendo il cavallo, comunque per lui sarebbe stato uno scambio favorevole. intanto, non so come sviluppare il mio cavallo, e in conseguenza gioco con una torre in meno... per quanto strano, mi � sembrata l'unica uscita per la mia torre. anche ta7 era prevista. e, comunque, dovevo contrarrestare la pericolosissima db3. potevo giocare a4, ma comunque, con da2, lui aveva lo stesso la diagonale bianca. qua sudavo freddo.  non ho paura di ta1, per cc7.  via di corsa.  oh, adesso s� che sta minacciando g3. probabilmente si accorge che se adesso potesse mettere la torre in a1, sarebbe simpatico per lui, e cos� vuole liberare la donna. ma ormai ho tempi da usare a mio favore. devo stare attento a lasciare spazio per la mia donna, che corre facilmente il rischio di essere catturata. ma il bello deve ancora arrivare... apro spazio alla donna, ma guadagno anche un tempo per l'attacco... brutto posto, ma... passo al contrattacco. ah, come gioca bene adesso il mio cavallo "sottosviluppato" :-) qua cominciava ad essere difficile sapere cosa fare, ma questa mi � piaciuta. adesso sono i suoi pezzi ad essere autobloccati.  voleva poter togliere l'alfiere. ma era meglio giocarla in a1! scopro il re, ma ho un attacco che vale la pena. non senza pericolo.  ah! questa me l'aspettavo. ma perde una qualit�! e se non prendo la torre? cxf4... catena solida di pedoni, ma ho una qualit�. e via libera in g (anche se l� c'� il mio re!). ecco la posizione veramente interessante... contrattacco bianco sul centro, re mio scoperto... mille viarianti. perché non kh7? sto rinunciando ai due pedoni (e lasciandogli pedoni passati in abbondanza per compensare la qualit�), scommettendo di vincere con il mio attacco.  che paura. c7 � una vera minaccia. e non posso fare ac7 per dd7. ma io penso ad altro.  se tg6 , si rifugiava in h1 e io non ero sicuro di fare in tempo. forse s�, ma... questa non poteva essere sbagliata.  se prendo il cavallo perdo un tempo preziosissimo.  dh8  non portava a niente.  sbaglio, ma come proteggersi? forzata, se rf7 � matto. ma anche cos�, per quella che segue: c'� mancato poco. le bianche mi distruggono, anzi, sono a una mossa dal matto, e hanno un attacco micidiale nel centro.

the most popular move. pirc defense, a now seldom used opening. controlling and occupying the centre. g6 is most popular, this is a very unusual move. protects. putting pressure on the e4 pawn. developing. likewise. d5 is better, but this develops the knight, and it doesn't look like the knights going anywhere, so for now, it's all good for white. this is the tarrasch defense on the wrong side, and with white in a very different position. wanting to get the knight out of position after dxe5 7. qxd8+ nxd8. another possibility is nxe5. now the knight or the king must be taken out of place. the knight volunteers and is now out of position. not a pin now, as the queen is gone. not wanting doubled pawns. finally, the pawn is swapped. the bishop is now developed. castles queenside? could be dangerous with the bishop where it is. threatening the bishop on g5. swap. black is in a nice position, with all of their pieces developed. wanting to develop the bishop queenside. wanting to castle queenside, and with nothing else to do the knight attempts to block the path of the rook on d1. wanting a swap. just in case the bishop is needed on a2. swap. now the bishop can check the king: bg5+ threatening the pawn on b7. blocked. awww. now what to do? … …pin the knight, maybe. the knight doesn't need extra protection, but it is received anyway. seeing, possibly, rf2. even more protection? buggar. now the knight is pinned again. heheheh… grrr. this knight is looking extremely important. threatening the rook who has no where to go but d1. the only safe square. oo! free pawn! yay! if the rook can move to b1, then the knight will be free. seeing what white was planning, black saw rd8. the knight is free! white doesn't see it, but: rd8 ng1 bd2 wins rook. the plan may work. awww, what? he did see it? muhahahahahaha!!! wins the rook anyway.  one might see a free rook on e1, but another might see that after be1 white can play rxd8+, but, to yet another, one might see: bxe1 rxd8+ kg7, and now the bishop on f1 is stuck and doomed. the last one is correct.  as the bishop takes the rook, the truth dawns on white, but he won't give up! … …or, maybe he will. anyway, white resigns here. thank you for reading my annotated game!

[a well-known position in the najdorf. stockfish team opts for the most common continuation.] [the famous "poisoned pawn" variation starts with 7...qb6; while 7...h6 8.bh4 qb6 has been the most recent try by black, with najdorf experts such as vachier-lagrave, dominguez, and wojtaszek giving it a shot.] [this move is relatively rare compared to the main line 8...qc7 9.0–0–0 nbd7 10.g4 b5 etc.] ?! [now, this is a real sideline, and a dubious one at that. black does not usually castle this early in bg5 najdorf, at least not until he has had some counterplay going on the queenside. the presence of the pawn on h6 makes this idea even more suspicious as now white can open up black's kingside with the usual g4–g5 thrust even faster.] [black have tried here 9...qc7; 9...nbd7; and even 9...g5 with acceptable results.] [this rauzer-like development is in fact more appropriate here. black needs to challenge white in the centre immediately as otherwise he might get crushed on the kingside.] [more in najdorf-style would be 10...qc7 which was played in the only two "decent" games i was able to find in my database. one was between two computers in a freestyle tournament, while another one was between two humans; however, both finished badly for black, especially the human one. 11.g4 b5 (11...nbd7 12.g5 hxg5 13.bxg5 b5 14.rg1 b4 15.nd5!  a typical, but very powerful blow. 15...exd5 16.nf5 nc5 17.nxg7 dxe4 18.bxf6!!  18...exf3 19.ne6+! covers the c8 bishop before delivering the final strike. 19...kh7 20.rd5 with inevitable mate to follow in the game 1–0 (20) daurelle,h (2263)-benitah,y (2421) l'estartit 2007) 12.a3 bb7 13.g5 hxg5 14.bxg5 nc6 15.nxc6 bxc6 16.rg1 g6 17.bd3 black is already in trouble. his kingside is very vulnerable and he has no counterplay on other parts of the board. 17...d5 18.bxf6 bxf6 19.exd5 bb7 20.bxg6! it's the right time to destroy the pawn shield around black's king. 20...fxg6 21.rxg6+ bg7 22.rdg1 rf7 23.qf2!

(22.hxg5?! is really not in the spirit of this position. black consolidates after 22...rh8) 22...gxh5 23.qxh5 rh8 24.qf3 and despite being a pawn down, it's still white that is calling all the shots.) 21.rdf1 qc7 22.qe3 qc6 23.rf6 and black has to show great precision in defence.] [black's position is passive, but quite solid - it's not simple for white to break through - so we will witness some light maneouvering until the position clears up a bit.] [of course, the bishop is immune.] [22...gxf5?? 23.gxf5 would lead to a quick checkmate along the g-file.] [23.bxe6?! is premature, since black is safe in the french-like structure after 23...fxe6 24.qd3 kg7] [a controversial decision. of course, black is looking to get some counterplay, but generally opening up the position favors the side that holds the initiative. strictly strategically speaking, white should be happy with this pawn exchange as in such positions he is usually the one that tries to push a2–a4 in order to create a pawn weakness on black's queenside (either b5 or a6). with his last move black has done this job for him and now he always needs to be careful about the a-pawn, which could prove especially weak in all sorts of endgames.] [it might have been more prudent for him to sit tight with a neutral move such as 25...bh4 but then again, how many people (and engines!) would forego an opportunity to finally get some counterplay?] ! we’ve already seen this move, but in this case it is more effective. white will now play on both sides of the board so he needs to clear the third rank for his heavy pieces and create some weaknesses on the kingside. this move is perfect for both ends.] [the right positional decision.] [the alternative 28...qxe6 seems to be playable as well. however, the queen is very passive on e6, as well as the rook on f8. the game can continue something like this 29.h4 a5 30.h5 g5 31.qd3+ kg8 32.rf5 a4 33.rdf1 with a difficult position for black. now any time black moves his queen from e6, white can sacrifice the e-pawn to open up his bishop with dangerous threats to black king. it should also be noted that 33...a3 is not dangerous due to 34.b3 and white will pick up the weak a-pawn later on.] [black succeeded in trading off its passive rook for white's attacking one. however, white initiative still hasn't died as he finds new ways to attack the king.] ! [looks scary, but stockfish finds a cold-blooded defence.] ! [taking the exchange 33...bxf6 34.exf6+ kh7 leads to a strong initiative for white after 35.qxe6 qb7 36.h4 etc.] [and white has to retreat.] [preparing a6–a5,] [since 37...a5 drops the pawn to 38.qd2] !? [komodo is just as resourceful.] [now 38...a5 doesn't work because of 39.qa7] ? an obvious mistake, although it is less obvious that it is the losing one! black is playing for the attack too stubbornly,] [when it should have thought about safety. why not 39...rf8 ? after the inevitable rook exchange, 40.rxf8+ (in this case 40.rf6 is not as dangerous as in the game since black has 40...bxf6 41.exf6 rxf6! 42.qe5 (42.bxf6 qf1+ 43.ka2 qxf6 is just a draw.) 42...rf1+ (black is ok even after the pedestrian 42...qf1+ 43.kb2 kf7) 43.kb2 qd7 44.qh8+ kf7 45.qxh6 d4 and white should better hold a perpetual.) 40...kxf8 white would have a small plus in the endgame, but it should be nothing serious.] ! [for the second time in the game, komodo goes for a recurring sacrificial motive. this time around, black has to accept the sacrifice.] [unfortunately for black, 41...qc6 42.h4 rc8 fails to 43.qd3! qe8 44.hxg5 rxc3 45.qxc3 hxg5 46.qe5 kf7 47.qxg5 qh8 48.qe5! and white is winning using the fact that the pawn endgame after 48...qxf6 49.qxf6+ kxf6 50.c4 is winning.] !! the key move! this position is very reminiscent of carlsen-caruana game from the zurich chess tournament two months ago, which carlsen won in a very nice style after sacrificing the exchange in a similar fashion. maybe komodo was inspired by that game? :)] [stockfish was undoubtedly expecting 43.hxg5 hxg5 44.qxg5 when 44...qg8 45.qf4 a5 46.g5 a4 should give him enough counterplay.] ! another quiet move with great impact. now the point of last two moves becomes obvious – white has basically stalemated black queen.] [black's position is already beyond saving.] [44...ke8 doesn't help. white demonstrates his winning plan 45.be5 qf7 46.qg6! the queen exchange is hopeless, so white continues to pick up kingside pawns, winning easily as well.; the desperado attempt 44...a5 45.be5 a4 runs into the counterattack 46.c4! axb3 47.cxd5 and it is black who is about to get checkmated or lose a significant amount of material.] [basically resigning, but there was nothing better.] [if black sits with 45...kf8 46.kc1 kf7 white pulls out another ace out of his pocket 47.c4! dxc4 48.bxc4 and the c-pawn's march will decide the game.] [a little game of cat-and-mouse before white converts the advantage.] [white has finally achieved a winning position. there is no defence against qg6.] [a very nice positional game by komodo. stockfish defended tenaciously, but it overestimated its chances in the very end and was punished swiftly.] 
-------------------------------------
this is the bogo indian defense. 4.nbd2 is equally common. 8…rd8 is the main line, with idea to wait for white to move the bishop and only then to take on c4. a new move, but hardly an improvement on the previously played 11…nc6. white voluntarily plays with an isolated pawn, to have more active play and also to avoid symmetry. it was important to hide the bishop in a safe place. 17…a6 was logical to prevent a future b4-b5. white opens the position and threatens d6. 20.nxd5 was slightly better. 20…nxd5 21.bxd5 rxc1 22.qxc1 giving white a small advantage. ? 20…qd6 was black’s only move. 21.qxd6 rxd6 22.nxd5 rxc1 23.nxf6+ gxf6 (23…rxf6 24.rxc1 nc6 25.ng5 h6 26.re1 bd7 27.nxf7 rxf7 28.b5 nd4 29.a4 kf8?

-------------------------------------
bluenoser: d6 or nf6 which would be my usual response to c4.  roneshet: d6 can you explain in a sentence the reason for d6?  a_random_guy: 1...nf6 that knight belongs on f6.  the d pawn can still be moved up 1 or 2 squares later, depending on white's move.  roneshet: nf6 sorry for asking. why is it important to move to knight now?  ptitroque: 1. nf6 is ok for me. bluenoser: d6 possible pirc defence?  a_random_guy: 2...c6 again, there are multiple viable moves here, it is mostly a matter of preference.  i pick 2...c6, to prepare to push d5 at once.  roneshet: c6 i agree. i think his next move will be bg2 - so c6 will also defend our castle... roneshet: d5 i'm not sure. but i think we need to open the middle a little bit.  bluenoser: g6 g6 with thoughts of bg7 developing and getting ready for our king side castle, if they play d4 we could play d3 instead of bg7. i think d5 could really open things up also, with lots of possibilities. i just like to play a bit more defence.  a_random_guy: 3...d5 after all, we played 2...c6 to prepare 3...d5.  ptitroque: 3.d5 is good. we shouldn't let whate taking the control of the center (not without fighting for it, at least) a_random_guy: 4...bg4 simple developpement move.  alternatives are 4...e6, 4...g6, 4...bf5 and 4...dxc4.  bluenoser: 4...bg4 looks good to me  ptitroque: 4... g6 to fiancheto our dsb, as they have opened the long black diagonal. our lsb could also be nicely placed in e6 - we can see later were to settle it.  roneshet: bf5 i say we should take out our bishop, so we can open the way to take out the knight afterwards to d7. then we can move safely e5. bluenoser: e6?? i was thinking e6 to open our diagonal for our bishop. we could also play g6 with intent of bg7 and castling.  a_random_guy: 5...e6 is fine overprotecting d5 is a good idea, it lets our dsb out and our lsb is already out, so it won't be locked in.  an alternative here would be 5...nbd7. it likely transposes into the same lines.  roneshet:  nbd7 i thinks we need to protect e5 - the middle. than we can move to e5 next move. the way i see it, d5 is already overprotected...  ptitroque: 5. e6 freeing our dsb, so that we'll be able to castle whithin 2 moves and have control over the a3 f8 diagonal. nbd7 ik ok as well.  a_random_guy: 6...nbd7 it's clear that our b knight belongs to d7 for now, to support f6, e5 and c5, so we may as well play it now. we'll have to wait for white's reply to figure out what is the optimal square for our black squared bishop.  roneshet: nbd7 i agree. i think we should also prepare for right side castling. we need the h8 rock there.  ptitroque: 6... nbd7 for the sames reasons than a random guy. we have to get control on c5 and e5. we have no other proper place for the knight. we have several squares for the dsb (depending on what they will play and the strategy, we'll decide.  bluenoser: 6.....nbd7 appears to be our best move.   ptitroque: 7. bd6 we can play a further e5 to take control of the center.  a_random_guy: 7...bd6 seems fine to me.  an acceptable alternative would be 7...be7, to overprotect our f6 knight.  roneshet: how about bc5? why not advance a little and position the bishop on a further diagonal?  a_random_guy: about 7...bc5. that move isn't actually horrible, it's just that white can push d4 at once and force us to move our bishop again, while they reinforce their center. that d4 push would partially block their dark-squared bishop though, so there's that. also, i don't really see the bishop being usefull on the a7-g1 diagonal for the moment, since they can easily close that diagonal. 7.bd6 could help prepare an e5 pawn push by black, eventually after castling.  bluenoser: bd6 of the two moves suggested i like bd6. bc5 in my opinion just helps them push d4 and chase our bishop around. i guess so far we are in agreement to move that bishop. i do believe bd6 to be more solid for us. bluenoser: castle? would now be a good time  a_random_guy: 8...0-0 yeah, it would be a good time to castle!  ptitroque: 8.o-o we've got to castle short so let's do it now ptitroque: interresting position 9... e5 not sure about it, it's getting complicated.  9th move ...maybe it's worth a discussion, we shouldn't decide to quickly. (discussions are interresting in this kind of games, because it's how to learn...)  bluenoser: 9....e5 i too was looking at this move...like you i think it is worth some discussion could be a key move in the game. i was also looking at qc7, then e5...but that might be too slow as they may push d4.  ptitroque: qc7? seems ok but if they play a further rc1, we might be in trouble.  roneshet: qe7 - why trouble? can you explain a little bit, why are we going to be in trouble if the do rc1? i think e5 is a very good move. i thought of h6 also. opening up for the king.  ptitroque: @roneshet if 1. ... qc7 2. rc1 let's suppose 2... b6 (or anything else) 3. cxd5 exd5 4. nd4 * but you suggested qe7 which is another matter. i'll have a look.  ptitroque: @ roneshed (about qe7) 9... qe7 seems safe for me, but we'll be heading to a close game and be less active. it's more chances to end with a draw.  now, it's a question of general strategy.  a_random_guy: 9...re8 to free f8 for our knight if needed, and to prepare the e5 pawn push.  ptitroque: 9...re8 i checked again to see if 9...e5 was possible and it's indeed dangerous to play it right now. with re8, it'll be safer.  ptitroque: 10... bf5 we have only 2 other options : 10... bh5 but i do not like this line because of 11.e4 10... bxf3 but we'll lose the bishop pair and get nothing in exchange.  roneshet: bf5 of bxf3 i think bf5 is better. bxf3 will let him take out this locked bishop...let him stay there...  bluenoser: 10...bf5 i like this move bf5, let them chase it if they want.  a_random_guy: 10...bh5 seems fine to me, we can always push e5 if they do push e4.  ptitroque: 10.... bh5 i've had a closer look and it seems it works.  bluenoser: try again here what makes bh5 better than better than bf5? i am not disagreeing just wondering why we want to stay on that diagonal.  ptitroque: @bluenoser a random guy probably has a better analyse than i do. the only little advantage i can find in bh5 is that it is on the diagonal of their queen. obviously they will notice it but it may limitate their moving possibilities at some points.  a_random_guy: @ptiroque the problem i see with 10...bf5 is that they can basically play 11.nh4 to trade off our bishop for their knight. if they want to push g5 to push our bishop to g3 before forcing a trade with 12.nh4, they'd have weakened their kingside more in that variation then if we had played 10...bf5.  ptitroque: @a random guy thanks, i didn't thought about nh4  bluenoser: thanks for explaining i can see it now!    roneshet: e5 get a better stand at the middle. next d4.  ptitroque: i hesitate e5 was indeed my first idea but we'll probably obtain a close game, for we'll have to push our d pawn if they play e4 and i do not like that kind of games.  qc7 is another possibility, connecting our rooks  bluenoser: 11....e5 e5 looks good to me, may give us a close game, but i believe we will have more space.  ptitroque: hmmm hmm it seems that they plan to attack our queenside...  i consider 12... qc7 : completing our developpement by joining our rooks and protecting our dsb in cas if they trade the central pawns. 12... e4 seems also playable, more aggressive. they'll have to respond energically if they want to avoid 13... e3. which would put them in troubles.  a_random_guy: another option 12...a4, to slow down white's advance on the queenside.  ptitroque: @ a random guy 12... a4 ? do you mean 12... a6 or 12... a5  what about if white answer 13. e4 ?  i suppose that both could be played  a_random_guy: oops i meant 12...a5, yeah.  roneshet: d4? taking more controll over the center of the board  ptitroque: i propose 13... dxe4 to prevent their knight to come on g5  a_random_guy: 13...d4 i don't really see ng5 as a threat, as it doesn't attack anything and we can just push it back with h6.  that being said, i'd suggest locking the center with 13...d4 instead to make both of their bishops locked in.  bluenoser: 13...d4 13...i like d4, i don't see the ng5 as a big threat. also gives us space advantage and their two bishops don't look very troublesome right now or in the near future.  roneshet: dxe4 explain please explain a little more about the reasoning. why would it prevent their knight from coming to g5? h6 would do it? roneshet: с5 a better stand in the middle.  a_random_guy: 14...qe7 c5 is probably fine, but i also like 14...qe7, attacking the a pawn.  bluenoser: qe7 qe7 forces them protect their a pawn either by pushing it or moving the rook they've already moved. my bet would be they will push the a pawn.  ptitroque: qe7 ...might lead to a less close game, personnaly, i prefer it. ptitroque: 15... b5 the situation is blocked on the center. we could try to push on the right wing  bluenoser: 16...b5 i don't see a better move than b5. roneshet: qe6 if they will not notice the trap, they will respond with nf3. and than we can do bxf3, the will respond with bxf3 and we can do qh3...  a_random_guy: hmmm both 17.nf5 and 17.f4 could be quite annoying for us. i'd suggest 16...bg6 here.  ptitroque: 16... bg6 yes, we must have some control on f5  a_random_guy: 17...bxf5 probably followed by 18.exf5 rac8.  roneshet: bxf5 well, this was our plan all along...  bluenoser: 17....bxf5 i don't see anything better!  ptitroque: 18... rac8 protecting the pawn - indirect menace on their q  bluenoser: 18...rac8 rac8 also appears to be forced to me. ptitroque: 20... be5 we are cramped.  the immediate threat is 20. bxd4, for our e5 pawn is pinned. i do not see any counterthreat for us. i believe that we should play 20... be5  but maybe i've overlooked something.  bluenoser: be5? i don't believe our bishop will go to e5 if my diagram is right. it could possibly go to c5  a_random_guy: 19...qf8 sure, 19...qf8 looks ugly, but it does unpin our e pawn and it provides additionnal support to our c8 rook, if they decide to pile on the c file. roneshet: h5 to open up this defense a little bit. if they answer with g5, we can do nfh7  a_random_guy: 20...h6 i don't like 20...h5 due to 20...h5 21.g5 nh7 22.h4, locking us in even more. i think we need to stop g5 from happening, since white really wants to bring their knight onto e4. by playing h6, we stop that plan for now and still open up h7 for the knight.  ptitroque: 20...h6 seems fine, indeed  bluenoser: 20....h6 h6 looks good to me...it is the other game that is a tricky one at the moment.  roneshet: n7c5 threatening b3 and d3. in addition we put it in a very central position.  bluenoser: 21. b4? i was looking at b4 which would give us more space and everything is protected.  ptitroque:  i do not like b4 2 possibilities ;  21... b4 22. axb4 axb4 23. ra6 and we are in trouble.  21... b4 22. axb4 bxb4 and we have an isolated pawn on the a file, which will be hard to defend.  bluenoser: 21,b4 on 22. axb4 bx4 was my intent, i don't see why it will be hard to defend as we have a pin on rook as the knight is on the same diagonal. you of course have the higher rating so i could be missing things moves down the road. i generally don't post when, but i put down that this was ron's suggestion.  the logic behind this is one person voted for 21...b4, and the other disagrees.  but, ron voted for this move independently of everyonelse based on what he thought was best.  and, i can relate to that, for the wrong reason, as well.  as this is how i thought during, i hate to say it, but the kibitzing moment in gm judit polgar's puzzle with the terrible headache.  that was, based on, what i thought the best move would be, independently of everyonelse.  plus we starting to run into danger of losing the game on time here, as we had about 2 days left.  and, that was, during a day off from work.. bluenoser: 22....axb4 22...axb4...if 23. ax b4....nh5.  roneshet: axb4 we knew they'd do that move...  ptitroque: 22... axb4 we are in trouble. i'm not sure it holds.  bluenoser: we could be in trouble i think you care correct ptitgorque. we should have seen this sereral moves back, or i should say our higher rated players should have seen it coming....i for one didn't. ptitroque: 23... nd7 we need to defend our e5 pawn - vital for our defense.  if they play ra e1 and a further nf3, we need at least 3 pieces to defend e5 and 2 of them have to be knights or bishops (since we have no pawn available to defend it).  roneshet: na4 well nd7 is also a good move, adding protection to the e5 pawn, and defending the other knight. but i think the danger from the rock on the a column is more imidiate...  bluenoser: 23...na5 i believe this was our original plan.  a_random_guy: 23...na4 this blocks the a file, preventing their rook from landing on a6 and pressuring our c6 pawn. in a pinch, we could trade our a4 night for their b2 bishop, to reduce pressure on our central pawns. i don't think trading the rook for our knight is worth it for white for now, if they want to play rxa4, though i could be wrong.  (i fixed some typos from my previous post)  roneshet: bb1 we can't put our b on c2 or e2, because it will lead to losing one of our pawns... bb1, as far as i can tell, is the only viable move.  ptitroque: bb1 yes, i see no other solution ptitroque: i suggest nxb2 our knight is poorly placed and stuck. their dsb is on a fine diagonal (it could take our d4 pawn it e5 dies, which is probable soon, for they will play kf3 and we cannot prevent it). i admit that it doesn't solve the problem of our e5 pawn.  maybe someone has something better to propose...  roneshet: nxb2 or nd5 i agree, but we shpuld consider, after or before, this line of defence on the e4 pawn. nd5 bxd5 cxd5 nf3 f6 ... ptitroque: nd5 is an option that i din't consider seriously but it's worth to analyse it.  thewrongreason: so, ptitroque mentioned about what we ought to consider which was with ron. i can wait a little, but by tomorrow evening, at the very latest, i'd have to make the move. as we're down to a little more then 2 days left to make the move.  bluenoser: nd5 nd5 looks good to me. they can't do much with their b on b2 i think we are helping oursevles more by playing the nd5.  ptitroque: 26... cxd5 what else ?  roneshet: only move cxd5 is the only move ptitroque: 27... qe7 they'll probably attack our unpritected d5 pawn, so that our queen can come and defend it on d7.  if they chose to move their knight on b3, we can menace their king side by qh4. our queen has to be mobile.  roneshet: agreed qe7, looks like a good option. i like the qh4 option...  a_random_guy: 27...f7 27...qe7 allows them to play 28.bxd4, as our e5 pawn would be pinned. 27...f7 would help to protect our e5 pawn, and prepare qf7 (protecting our d5 pawn while keeping an eye on e8) and kf8. geting out of the g8-a2 diagonal, and protecting e8 once more.  ptitroque: 27 th move a random guy is of course right. qe7 doesn't work.  27. f7 is ok. they have no more lsb to menace our king on the a2-g7 diagonal. roneshet: qf7 i say, qf7 following by h5, will open their king side...  how are you all doing with the corona madness?  ptitroque: 28...qf7 seems ok  protecting our d5 pawn and giving mobility to our queen  bluenoser: qf7 qf7 looks good to me too. ptitroque: 29... qc7 ?! gives us a strong menace : they cannot prevent us to play e4 and we have a mating menace. if they play f3, we can play qg3+ and their knight gets it.  please gentlement check carefully, for it's edge to edge situation  bluenoser: qc7? i was thinking qc7 with thoughts of pushing our e5p to e4. with the threath of qh2. just taking a quick look at this so far.  ptitroque: 29... qc7 !? the more i think about it, the better it seems. we might get an overwhelming attack  roneshet: problems... if they move their knight to g6 after we do qc7, we cam be in a great deal of trouble. 29. ... qc7 30. ng6 e4  than what will we do? say they do f3... 31. f3 qg3+ 32. kf1   we should not open our e column... it's dangerous!!!  ptitroque: @ roneshed 29... qc7 30. ng6 e4 31. f3 qg3 32. rd2 (forced) qe1 chessmate  bluenoser: f4 was unexpected. we were all thinking f3 for some reason.....going to have to look this one over really good now.  roneshet: e4 i still think e4 is a good move.  bluenoser: e4? i've been wondering if that is still the best follow up move?  a_random_guy: i don't like 30...e4. 30...qc6 maybe? they can play 31.ng6, covering their f4 pawn and leaving our d4 pawn defenseless.  i think this position is bad for us, and is actually quite complicated; they might want to pile on everything they have onto e5.  that being said, i'm unsure what the best move would be: here are all the moves i could see being played:  kf7, qc6, nb6, nc3  personally, i prefer 30...qc6: we still threaten to take on f4, and it unpins our e5 pawn as e8 now has enough protection for now. it also protects our d5 pawn as well, as it could get targeted by their queen in some lines.  bluenoser: qc6 qc6 does look like a solid move for sure.  roneshet: qc6 i really learned from your explanation, thanks. qc6, leads to minimum losses at the moment...  ptitroque: 30... qc6 seems good, indeed  a_random_guy: 31...nc3 i think we can't quite play 31...exf4 sue to 32.bxd4, locking our knight to a4 forever. by playing nc3, we more or less force them to exchange their bishop for our useless knight.  sample line:  1. ... nc3 2. bxc3 dxc3 3. fxe5 bxe5 4. nxe5 rxe5 5. rxe5 fxe5 6. rxe5 re8 7. rxe8+ qxe8 8. qxc3 qe3+ * likely a draw?  roneshet: sounds good nc3 also will open the way for d5 to move to d4, thus opening the way for the queen.  bluenoser: nc3 looks good nc3 looks good to me, maybe our only good move. the sequence after could change along the way. i know you are looking at what you consider best moves on each side. they may do something different which might even give us winning chances. bluenoser: 32.....dxc3 dxc3 is our only move as predicted by a_random_guy.  a_random_guy: 32...dxc3 not much else to say here. the question is whether they'll play 33.qxc3 or 33.fxe5 (probably the latter). ptitroque: 33... d4 if 34.qb3 (probable), then 34... kh7  bluenoser: 33...d4 d4 looks good to me. i know i can't look as deep into the game as ptitroque can.  a_random_guy:  i dislike 33...d4. i'd suggest 33...e4 instead they can play 34.qb3+, and it would give them the time to take on e5 safely, leaving us 2 pawns down like in this line:  1. ... d4 2. qb3+ kh7 3. fxe5 fxe5 4. nxe5 bxe5 5. rxe5 rxe5 6. rxe5 *  i also just realized we can't play play 33.exf4 either, due to ne7+. i think we've already lost this game, but 33...e4 seems like our best bet to keep us into the game, not opening the e file yet and stopping a series of disavantageous trades on e5.  roneshet: qc7 that being said, and i think well said. we can add a little bit more defense on the e5 square, while also preventing the option of ne7+, which will be devastating.  bluenoser: 33....e4 yes of course e4 not d4....that is the move i was looking at too. but did say d4 which was not correct. roneshet: qc7 no one has responded.. though we already made the move, i'd like to hear you opinion on qc7. if it's possible. thanks!  ptitroque: @roneshed about qc7 i believe it would have been a bad move for 2 reasons  1. offensive reason we cannot take the f4 pawn which is protected by the g knight and we have no chance to capture or force the g knight to move.  2. defensive reason it would enable white to play dxe4 without trouble : 33. dxe4 dxe4 34. rxe4 rxe4 35. rxe4 and white has control on the open file with plenty of attacking possibilities. a_random_guy: 34...kf7 i don't think we can prevent the loss of another pawn; the best we can do is activate our pieces, avoid trading our pieces and trade some pawns. roneshet: qa6? go around to threaten h3, g3  a_random_guy: resign i can't think of a good move here, i'm pretty sure we've already lost at this point. sorry!  bluenoser: resign i believe i agree here. i can' see them making any major mistakes. perhaps it will be another learning experience for everyone.  thewrongreason: we have resigned here. i'll be annotating this game later this week.  for those that are wondering, my resignation was gg.

-------------------------------------
  this move was a surprise to me. obviously white's best move here was to play c4 and challenge my strong central pawn. if white had played 4.c4 then, after 4...c6 4.nc3 dxc4!? 5.e4 b5 6.e5 h6 the game would be transposed to a form of queen's gambit called the botvinnik system; which is one of the sharpest modern openings and leads to an unbalanced and very dynamic game. a very important move! now i can exchange my side pawn with white's central pawn. also my queen now is free and can come into the game in the right moment. now, i'm planning to put my queen on a5 and exploiting the pin by playing ne4. this plan is similar to black's plan in the cambridge springs variation of the queen’s gambit declined. if black can execute this plan, he will equalize in an early stage of the game and will seize the initiative from white very soon. this is the most reasonable reply. white protects his d-pawn and opens a diagonal for his light square bishop. black exchanges his flank pawn with white's central one, a good positional achievement! an in-between move. i don't like this move for white because it forces exchange of light square bishops and this is completely favorable for black. so i can put a question mark to this move and consider it a strategic mistake. i think it was better for white to take on d4 with his e-pawn and develop his bishop on e2 or d3.

[??] 38.… rg6 40.rf8 h5 gives black some hope.  now he has none. if white’s f-pawn were the only pawn on the board black would have the opposition and the game would be a draw by stalemate: 46.ke6 ke8 47.f7+ kf8 48.kf6.  white realizes such is not the case, however, and avoids letting black off the hook with that line of play. black realizes that after the exchange of the current queens he has no way to stop white from getting another one (or two).  a resignation when it is one’s opponent’s turn to move is not all that uncommon in games played over the internet with time control expressed in increments of days. 
-------------------------------------
i'll anotate this game, for it seems to illustrate some chess strategical principles : open file, center... queen's gambit. this move comes to early in the game : none of both coulours is fully developped. ok for the trade taking with tege knight would have meant 11... bxg2 - white is one pawn up but the queen will be harrassed now, a few moves tp contain black and save the queen. the queen has to stay on black squares - then, a couple of positionnal moves (we are still in the opening). once agai, this attack might have been to early. both caps are not fully develloped. white has to save his queen. queen in safe, the defense is ok. no counter attack possible (white is not fully developped). a weak move - moving the queel no join the rooks would have been better. now begins the fight for the open file. bold attack but the black queen will be soon under harass. strong menace - aiming at the center which is under black control. the fight for the open d file and consequently the center will occupates most of the time, from now on. the control of the d file is vital. white cannot let black take control of the d file ( and, consequently the center). waiting move. if black takes, white will control the d file. now, white controls the d file. the following moves are fight for the center. the g4 square, proved to be an important one further in the game. probably a mistake. black's attacking possibilities are ùore reduced than white's defensive capacity. retreat. doubtfull move, which weakens the black king (the white queen holding firmly the long black diagonal). launching the attack ! centeeeeeeeer ! black has only 2 moves available menacing q and n only move to save the knight - now white has a better control on the center. to protect e3 black nas not plenty of options. settling at the center and beginning of the final attack. crucial move. 32. qd6 and 32. qd8 would have loss the queen. 32. q d7 was bettre but it wouldn't have changed much. several menaces. not the best move - mate in 3.  
-------------------------------------
king's gambit... tricky opening as the game will show it. usual answer the most common answer still in the books menacing f7 taking control of the long diagonal and enabling a further bd4+ (which is black's plan) white has castled and is strong on the center but his king can be attacked via the a7 f2 diagonal. black has 2 options : developp the queenside pièces to enable the castle or use the white's king weakness to attack. first : develop the center (common move) and taking control of d4 one of the most common answer, protecting the e pawn and freeing the dsb. pinning the knight and developping on the queenside. mistake. it weakens the king and achieve little... white should have carried on developping on the center, unpinning his knight by moving the queen or attacking on the center... ... for black doesn't have to move the bishop. blunder. white falls in the trap and will soon be in big trouble. now the white king is in serious danger  mistake. white has little good move available but 10. nd2 was better as was 10. nd5 (abandoning the knight to his doom) white submits here for if 11. be3 bxe3+ and the situation is the same with one bishop less for white if 11. kh1 g3 and white is facing an unavoidable mate by 12. rxh2+mate if 11. rf2 bxf2 12. kxf2 rxh2 and white is 4 points late in material with a very weak king. 
-------------------------------------
marathon game : the white king moved 35 times, the black queen 45 times for a total of 108 moves. uh uh ! i do not like the caro kahn very much ! everything standard. the main problem in this move is that it blocks the  dsb  both sides have developped. i found that in the db. it exploit the d1 h5 diagonal, frees the dsb and enable sa further nd3 or nc2 carrying on with the line bold move. rrading center contested, black has more pieces develloped, white has a better pawn structure, white controls the opened diagonals. i think that white is slightly better. annoying for white but black will quickly be dangerous on the queenside white is on defense but has strong counterplay available. sir lancelot leaves the court to run into battle. another bold move black is still on attack sir lancelot, back to the courtyard. shame on him ! to prevent 20. ne2+ the black knight prepares 20. nf e6 beginning of a sequence which will create weak pawn structure on both sides offering to trade the g knight against perceval on d2 white's one pawn up maybe nc4 would have been better the black knight retreats. white is one pawn ahead, has 2 passed pawns (which will prove to be important at the end) but his pawn structure is a disaster. white is better on the center but black controls the open file. the white king is weak... the situation is slightly in white's favour but not much. only move black has a strong attack on the kingside lancelot dies bravely beneath his loved queen. this trade weakens black's attack no choice the siege machines are approaching. king arthur doesn't feel at ease in his besieged castle bringing reinforcement now the knighthood ! "oh my king ! the next assault is about to come" "it doesn't matter. counerattack, my brave knight !" "but it's serious my king !" "go to sacrifice, my lady" - no passaran. and dame guenièvre charges wildly, beginning a wild battle. now the board is cleaned but the fight is far to be finished. during the next 38 moves, no pieces will be taken. beginning of a long positionnal sequence during which both sideshave to be very carefull because the game is so opened that a little mistake can be fatal. as i see no way to mate the king if black doesn't do any big mistake, my idea is to bring my king near the center and push the d pawn but for that, black must let me some quietness.  black king in safety, the black knight can move freely one step toward the center back to the corner. around this moment, i offered a draw, refused during the next 21 moves, the poor arthur moves 19 times and is set in chess 15 times (the four last moves, being under mating menace) black could have try to attack the a and c pawns so that he gets a passed pawn on the queenside but he opts for a direct attack on poor arthur. at this point i offered a draw once again. the white king has little choice but black has not enough material to conclude. to avoid 3 times repetition, black has to change his tactic, enabling king arthur to escape.  now, the white king has good chances to attain the center and be able to support the passed pawn. poor perceval dies on his king's side, slain by the black knight !  i think that the exchange is in white's favour because black has only one piece which means that the mate is not possible without the king and that he cannot trade one piece against another. the bold king arthur rushes forward, beeing now at the head of his army. menacing the b pawn and enabling a further d5 white has now the advantage but the game will last 32 more moves preparing d5 according to gk computer, it's a mistake. b5 would have been better. now white has definitely the advantage. now we go for another chase : within the next 15 moves, the poor arthur moves 13 times. at least, arthur doesn't have to stay and protect the d heroïc footman my plan is now to slay the b and c black soldiers and, once the menace is eliminated, to bring the king on the e file, so that he can grant a tittle to the brave d soldier. now, king arthur in expedition toward e file. mission accomplished. white needs 2 moves without being set in check. blunder, black is doomed : 94. ... qf4 would have been better, enabling a further check whatever white plays.  if 96. d7, 96. ... qf8+mate arthur is blocked but his proud footman will protect him. the only move to prevent 98. d8 white will have to sacrifice a rook. black has nothing else to play to avoid 99. re7 with further mate by rg7 etc. last trading sequence. gk computer considers it as a blunder, there was a quicker mate. the black pawn is more advanced. white will have to sacrifice the rook. blak submits. thanks to dracoargentum for this tight game. 
-------------------------------------
probably expecting a benoni ... but black choses another line neglecting the in and developping carrying on developping black could have opt for a long castle after 6. nc6 both kings in safe the d pawn is overprotected. but white takes off ! retreat white gains space on the queenside to prevent 11. nb5 and prepare b5 aiming at d5 and the weak f7 to control c5 and have a look at d4 preparing a further b5 aiming at c5 gaining space reinforcing the control of the e semi open file. i'm not sure about this move. probably white wants to accentuate his control on f4 to avoid being obliged to take with the e pawn in case if f4 is under attack. it leaves the f knight without protection but black has no way to attack it for the moment. reinforcing d5 an preparing a further b5 which would block white on the queenside. the unprotected knight leaves, white menaces 16. e4. this is the exlanation of 14. g3 now black can play 15. ... c5 or 16. a5, his bishop is protected against a white queen's attack. challenging the d pawn black prefers to keep on his own attack than to counter the white one charge ! the trading sequence is over. the center is still contested, black controls one open file, material is equal, both pawn structure are ok, white controls more space on the queenside. the position is equilibrated with a slight advantage for black (it seems to me) of course, the next targets will be the 2 advanced pawns. preventing 21. nxd5 and joining the rooks a wild trading sequence begins now the game is wide opened. black's control on the open file is not effective anylonger, material is equal, black's control on the center is slighly better. white still controls more field on the queenside. black's a pawn is under direct menace. white has 2 pieces unprotected against one for black. the situation seems equal. to prevent 25. bxa6 trading. taking control of the second open file. to unmask the e rook and block the white king. partially blocking the e file and preparing a further bd4 i do not understand this move. a fine row of bishops ! ... not for long. black will move his 2 bishops to menace d4 with his rook. white cannot protect d4 but when he'll have to move the dsb, the lsb will be protected. ... so that the black bishop is back in the row. back to a previous situation. white seems to be looking for a draw. ... and black plays the same. but white's not trying to draw in moment. still protecting the b pawn and menacing the dsb bishop protected attacking the lsb "à découverte"  no other place to carry on menacing b5 pawn advance, preparing the game end menacing 36. bxe4 fxe4 and black has an isolated pawn. ... so that black has to take king toward the center white is looking for exchanges but why ? probably to set the rook on a light square because black has only the dsb left doubling the rook on open file and pinning the dsb unpinning the dsb exchanging - black will gain one pawn in the bargain black is now one pawn ahead to prepare to double the rooks protecting g7 and sending the king as near as possible of the center this move enables the black king to approach the center ... which it does white will equalize in material material is equal, rooks doubled on an open file. both pawn structures are similar. the black king is more centralized and the black pawns are more advanced, black has a slight advantage... ... so that it takes white is looking for a draw, trying perpetual check. black refuses to draw. now, the black king is blocked on the 8th line, white's situation is better than previously proposing a trade 53. gxf4 would have meant draw. advancing the king toward the center freeing the rook. black has to take. if 55. ... ra3+ 56. kf4 and black loses one pawn keeping the king as near as possible from the center centralized king. black still doesn't want a draw menacing both pawns initiating a sequence to protect the f pawn. f pawn protected but the black rook is less mobile. to enable 64. ke5 preventing a further ke6 which would have meant the loss of one pawn for black. white king in safe (if 64. ... re3+ 65. kxf5 to enable 65. ... re3+ black takes risks to enable the king to support an attack on the white pawns to enable a further rg8 or rh8 to enable  a further f4 pinning the g pawn to the king. black still plays 67. ... f4 no choice for white white proposes to trade, still looking for a draw. black doesn't want to draw. black still refuses the draw keeping the rook on the f file to avoid the white king to come on f5 preventing the black king to come on g6 or h6 and protect his little soldier white has to loose the pawn. white will get the pawn. now the draw is unavoidable  
-------------------------------------
queens gambit, slave variation. very solid. also playable (and popular) is bg5, but i noticed that i have a better score with this move (even thu i don't know why). i'm sure this has been played before, but for me i get out of the books here. i just don't want to play bd3 and loose a tempo after dxc. so i prepare to fianchetto the bishop, even thu my king is still in the center. ?! not sure what this was for. prepare b5 maybe. 0-0 seems better. finally, i cannot delay this if i want to finish my development.  ?! not sure what is the point, likely 0-0 at once is better. at last some action in the center. black has an edge in development and decide to open the center. i cannot allow e4 because of the fork, and because my pieces would be burried alived. 11.c5 ? bc7 would be bad for white. i cannot let him inflict me double pawns on f3. black has the initiative. 0-0-0 seems more dangerous because the q-side pawns can easily be exchanged. but my king is almost alone. what will black do for the center ? after 14...nxd5 minor pieces would be exchanged, and i would have tried a minority attack on the q-side (2 pawns vs 3), while black would probably have gone for a king attack on the other wind. the chosen move gives a central isolated pawn, that can be a weakness or a help for an attack. c column opens as well. position is balanced. i propose more exchange and try to make d4 a strong place for my knight. ! black occupy the column 1st, i should fight for it latter if i can. ?! i guess the bishop exchanged would have favored white, but b8 seems a better place, not blocking the rook. so i challenge the column ? black should have tried 17...ne4, or heaven some qd6 (threatening mate). now it's position looks more cramped. with these 2 wonderfull diagonals for my bishops, i prepare some b+q battery to attack the king. black goes first. 14 g3? bxh3. or 14 ng3 ?! but the knight cannot move and if the qd6 move, bxn would destroy my pawns. so i weaken e3 aiming at h4 and e3 (x-ray). as french says: "un air de déjà vu" ^_^ 20... nf6?? 21. bxnf6 loose. while 20...g6 qd4 is quite unpleasant. so, same medecine for both players (f4 and f5). the e6 bishop is burried. just considering the knight position, white has a big +. black knight want to jump on e4. soon, black will play, nd6 - e4, or attack e3 with q+r, and come into play. so i need to find something. !? open everything while ahead in development. i exchanged 1st to avoid bxe3+ and bxc1 in some variation. not sure it is mandatory but i felt it safer. a pawn is a (doubled) pawn ! i was expecting 24...nf6 followed by 25...re8. gk computer spots this as a mystake. may be, but a dangerous one as we'll see. i protect the pawn, but actually 25.kh2 followed by 26.rg1 is better, without fearing 26...qf2+ thanks to 27.rg2. black counter attack on f5 or e4 with the knight, after which the q can enter in g3 but this simple defense stop it. and now i felt confident for the win. forced gk computer found out a nice tactic : 28. rc1 bxe3 29. rxc8! rxc8 30. qe6 rf8 31. qxe3 only square, but it is fine as d2 is under control i intended to trap my opponent, as 30...be3 (or bc7) is faced with qc3 wining the bishop thanks to the qxg7# threat. i was expecting 30...ba7 31 qc3 rg8. so i forked anyway. again i missed a tactic here : 31.rd1 !! as 31... rxr is countered by 32.qf8+ kh7 33. qxg7#. forced to counter the mat ! never too late to loose ! after 32.fxrg6 ?? qxh3# the knight is not protected as the g6 rook must protect g7 desperate. gk computer proposes the sharp : … ne8 34. qxc8 rc6 ! 35. bxg7+ kh7 36. qxb7 qxf3 37. bd4+ bc7 38. qxc6 bxf4+ 39. kg1 qxd1+ 40. kg2 qe2+ 41. bf2 nd6 with a +5, but i would still not be confident there is no perpetual check in such an open position with the queens on board. last boulet 37.kh1 ??? qxf3# here my opponent resigned, after qxn it is an easy mate.  thanks for watching, feel free to leave coments.

-------------------------------------
the game begins as a bishop's opening: vienna hybrid (c28). a rare opening which allows you to avoid the hackneyed ruy lopez. this opening is ok as long as you are not in love with your king's bishop. you allow the exchange of it for the queen's knight to gain time and a white square lock on the center i begin to prepare for wing activity with the next few moves. the move 9.... c6  is given a ?! in the game carl schlechter vs wilhelm steinitz, 1898. i personally do not see why. black has to develop play in some way although it is clear he will probably never do the d6-d5 break.  now that all of my pieces are ready for action, i open the position. with the move 18. bd2 i began to see the possibility of a combination. i sensed that black would not move his queen but would prepare his own combination to guard the f5 pawn. and here it is. i looked at all the possible continuations for a day or so and finally was surprised to find an eight (8) move combination that involved the sacrifice of the knight and even a rook with check.  it is because of these types of positions, i love chess. the energy of the white position completely overcomes the material considerations. the combination begins with 19. ngxe4.  after the game the gameknot analyzer said that this was an inaccuracy. here is the gameknot analyzer analysis at this point:  19. ngxe4 inaccuracy: -1.13 » 19. ngxe4 fxe4 20. qg3+ kh8 21. nxe4 bb4 22. bxb4 qxb4 23. ng5 bf5 24. rxd7 rxd7 25. qe5+ kg8 26. rxf5 rxf5 27. qxf5 rd1+ 28. kh2   best: -0.29 » 19. ncxe4 fxe4 20. qxd7 rxd7 21. bxa5 rxd1 22. rxd1 e3 23. rd3 bg5 24. h4 bf4 25. ne2 bh6 26. bc3 rf1+ 27. kh2  funny, huh? the gameknot analyzer thought that my continuation 19. ngxe4 was a mistake and completely missed the subsequent 22.nd5! at this point black could bail out with a queen for three minor pieces with the following continuation.  21.... bxf8  22. nd5 qxd2  23. rxd2 cxd5  24.cxd5 bf7  25. qc7 be7  26. d6 bg5  27. re2 bg6  28. qxb7 nf6  29 qe7 re8  30. qxa7  and there is very little doubt that white will overcome black with all of those pawns. 24. bh6 was the really hard move to see earlier at the 19th move. white drops a rook with check but wins by force! and now black is in sort of zugzwang. he cannot move his queen from the back rank the knight and king and the h-pawn can't move at all.  so the winning process is fairly simple, create a passed pawn on the queen side and trade all of the material.  black resigns. this was a lot of fun.  gandalfnefod 
-------------------------------------
queen's pawn opening ! black can play the benoni which i'm working in the moment. modern benoni, first move. but it's not the expected move. no benoni for this time. black had no precise idea about wht to do and changes his plan. we go for the boring four knights opening. now it looks more like a sicilian of some sort. not a very efficient move when the e pawn is still in the starting block. i'm not sure about this move. if white takes with the knight, black will have a double pawn difficult to defend and has moved twice the same piece. on the other hand, by playing f6, black can easily drive away white's dsb and the knight at the center menaces the white knight and the bishop. white chooses to retreat his bishop, probably fearing 5. ... nxc3 6.bxc3, doubling the c pawn. trading trading settling in the center and opening diagonals for the dsb and the queen. retreating and menacing the e pawn. the d pawn is now weak but can be protected, by 9. ... be6. good place for a knight on the center if it cannot be attacked by the pawns. black has to develop and the f2 square is an interresting target. attaécking the bishop. white trades  apparently a good move, winning a pawn and menacing the h rook. to drive the bishop away and occupate the half open file. the drawback is that black will have to caslte long and the king on c8 won't be safe at all.  to stay on the center will not be safer as the two central pawns are far away from home. as black has 4 pieces out against one for white, black has the initiative and it balances the unsafe king position (but may be not the late in material). obliging black to lose one move to retreat. undangerous check so that the queen is no more necessary to protect d5 all of black's minor pieces are out now and white has still a bishop in his garage (and need 2 moves to leave because of the menace 16. be2 rxg2)  to prevent black to castle but a mistake anyway because the dsb will have to move twice. i believe that better would have been 16. g3 to prepare a fiancheto. the bishop has to leave. just to permit the castle probably to prevent the castle but it's a mistake to me because black gets more and more developed and white has only 3 pieces out. and it doesn't prevent black to castle anyway. furthermore, i think theat the fiancheto on g2 would have been the best option for white and it is now more difficult. so, black developpement can be considered as completed. both kings are unsafe (although white can still castle and the black king cannot move on b8). black is better on the center, the semi open file g is under black control, black is in late in material, white's pawn structure is better but underdevelopped. black occupates far more field than white. to permit the castle black's plan is to attack on the center before white can castle so that he can menace the royal pair. the c pawn is pinned. black could have played 20. ... rxd4 21. qc2 and then, and then... i had no idea how to prevent white to castle and unpined the c pawn. this is far more menacing. expecting 22. kxe2 now, black has a winning sequence. better to attack with the bishop than withe the queen (by 22. ... qb5+), to control the d1 square and because the queen can also come on black squares and the bishop not. to enable the black queen to come on the e file. i do not see any option for white to avoid the mate in 4 moves. white submited here. anyway, the king would have to move on line 1, black would take the white queen with mate to follow with queen on g2 or rook on line 1. 
-------------------------------------
i'm annotating this mainly because of the ending.  according to gameknot's computer, the end position is +2.14 for black.  i agreed a draw believing that i couldn't force a win but whether i was right or not, the computer's scoring was nonsensical - it should either have been 0-0 or 100% for black. white ducks standard qp indian/nimzo type lines that would have resulted from 2. c4  i adopt my favourite king's indian formation anyway. black has a standard king's indian formation.  white's is a somewhat conservative formation more commonly seen against something like the slav, i think. i continue my development, developing my n towards the centre.  i often play this n to a6 or d7 in the king's indian but see no need to avoid the best square in this position. prepares ...e5 not quite sure what was in white's mind here...  the computer calls it an inaccuracy. (+0.38 rather than -0.33 for 8. nc3) white gives up a n.  not sure why ...  better was 10. bg5 according to the computer, which now scores things +2.78 in black's favour. another mistake.  better was 13. qb3 ne4 14. nxe4 bxe4 15. rad1 qc6 16. f3 bf5 17. rxd8 rxd8 18. rd1 rxd1+ 19. qxd1 bf6 20. qd5 kg7 21. b4 ? better was 14… be4 15. qb3 bxd5 16. qc2 qe7 17. e4 bc6 18. be3 qh4 19. f3 a5 20. qc5 nd7 21. qg5 qxg5 22. bxg5 according to the computer. and now, 15. f3 was better the computer evaluates this as +5.32 for black. i'm always nervous about making captures like this but it seemed safe enough at the time.  the computer identifies it as a mistake (+2.84 rather than +5.30). and here, the computer reckons 17. ra2 to be better. although the b was out on a limb, it was ok where it was.  17... rfe8 would have maintained my advantage, preventing the next move. suddenly white wins the piece back.  my b has nowhere to go.  needless to say, i should have seen this coming and prepared for it rather than taking on b2. not as good as 18...g5, apparently: best: +2.71 » … g5 19. bxg5 f6 20. bf4 bg6 21. qb3 qf7 22. qxb7 bxe4 23. qxa7 rd7 24. qc5 bxd5 25. rfe1 rfd8 26. a4 f5  an inaccuracy ... and here, the computer prefers 30.... rxe4, allowing black to pick off the a4 pawn after white reciprocates. ? generally speaking, i believe it's a good principle to exchange when ahead on material, but this is one of those occasions when you have to look further.  better was 30… qe4 35. f5 qxf5+ 36. qxf5 gxf5 37. ke2 ke7 38. ke3 h5 39. kd4 ke6 40. g3 a6 41. kc4 ke5 42. kb4 and white was wrong to refuse the exchange. by now, black's advantage is clear but care is still needed. ? but white worsens his position further.  46. qc1 a4 47. qc7+ kh6 48. qc1+ g5 49. qc6 qb2+ 50. kh1 a3 51. qd6 qa1+ 52. kg2 qa2+ 53. kf1 qb1+ 54. kg2 qc2+ 55. kg1 qc1+ 56. kg2 is a better line. at this point, the computer gives black's advantage as +4.12 but this mistake reduces the advantage from +5.15 to +3.52.  better was … qd5+ 49. kf2 qf5+ 50. ke2 qe4+ 51. kf2 qf4+ 52. kg2 qxg5+ 53. kf3 qf5+ 54. ke2 qe5+ 55. qxe5 fxe5 56. kd3 a3 57. kc3 e4 58. kc4 kf6, whereby repeated checks snatch material and swap in more advantageous circumstances. here, the computer prefers a series of checks, starting with 50. qa2+, keeping black's advantage down to +3.55, rather than +5.18 resulting from its preferred response of ...qd2+ to 50.h4 and here the computer's event horizon produces an interesting variation.  on white's 50. h4, it recommended that black respond with ...qd2+ but now it prefers ...qd5+, with  marginally higher value of +5.21.  i was intent at this stage on eliminating white's counter-chances by getting rid of his annoying f6 pawn, hoping to capitalise on my 2-1 kingside pawn majority, or indeed eliminate white's pawns completely. i've achieved that objective.  now, can i swap off queens? ? played with the intention of allowing my pawns to start their advance but losing sight of the fact that white can just nick the h-pawn. white gratefully snatches the bounty. ? here, the computer prefers qc4+, followed by a series of checks and king advances that force black backwards: best: +1.03 » 59. qc4+ ke7 60. qc7+ kf8 61. qb8+ kg7 62. qb7+ qf7 63. qb2+ kh7 64. qh2+ kg8 65. qh6 qf5 66. kh4 kf7 67. qg5 qe4+ 68. qg4 qe1+ 69. kg5 ? and now my best option was to force the q exchange immediately with 59...qe5+ ? allowing the exchange again: mistake: +2.64 » 64. qf4 qxf4+ 65. kxf4 kh6 66. kg4 g5 67. kh3 kh5 68. kg3 g4 69. kg2 kh4 70. kf2 kh3 71. kf1 kg3 72. ke2 kg2 73. ke3 best: +1.15 » 64. kg4 qf5+ 65. kh4 qe4+ 66. kg3 kg7 67. qc3+ kf7 68. qc5 ke6 69. qb6+ kf5 70. qf2+ ke5 71. qc5+ qd5 72. qe7+ kf5 73. qf8+ ke4 74. qf3+  i think the computer's analysis is flawed in the first line.  at move 70, kf2 looks like a blunder to me.  white needs to maintain the opposition.  this time i don't spurn the opportunity, though my king is not as well placed as it had been on move 59.  the computer assesses this position as +3.16. but now it reassesses the score at -0.01! and now it's +0.01 :-) and now it's -0.01 :-)  black can't get his k ahead of his p and thereby force white's k away but i could at least have advanced up the board with 66...g5 followed by ...kh5 etc as shown in the computer's annotation to 64. qf4?  was i right to accept the draw offer, or could i have forced or wangled a win? 
-------------------------------------
hmmm bad luck for me.. its not the e4 move but its f4.. in some variations of the french defence, the winawer as example f4 is playd in a later state.. therefore i still replied with e6 with keeping the possibility in gaining that position open still possible. but also kept in mind that there is a good change that we wont end up in a french defence variation. still possible.. but also kept in mind that there is a good change that we wont end up in a french defence variation. however, the moves that are played in the french defence looks legit on against this opening as well.  okay, well in the french defence the e pawn normally goes to e4 instead. so maybe its time to drop that idea for black. however as said before.. the pawn position that you go for in the french defence, also looks strong here. so i just proceed with that way of developing.  at first sight, this looks solid for white. however, if i can brake up the center the black squares might become available for my dark bisschop. i believe we got an equal position here. b3 gives white the opportunity to set the white dark bisschop on the long diagonal. this moves makes the square e3 weak. so i wouldn’t be surprised if white wants to go for e4 and maybe even f5. however, this migt take some time.. my dark bisschop is attacking the f4. when he plays e4 white will lose the defence on f4. i also want a to let my white bisschop go to a better square. i prefer to do so without blocking other options. bisschop looks strong on b7 but on the other side.. there is a lot material in the way for that long diagonal. also the knight on f3, is overprotected. on a later state, i also want some options to do something on white queenside of the board.. therefore i do believe that the move a5 makes sense. if i can push that pawn fun further on the a file.. it might give white holes. if i get it to a3 it also might irritate white darks bisschop. plus, i leave the option to move my light bisschop to a6. 
-------------------------------------
 i find it fun and also a bit my style to play e6 against the f4. i’m not a professional and there are many stronger then me but still if you like the way i playd against f4 feel free to do so as well. 
-------------------------------------
with 3 d4 this unfold to be the scotch game, which i really enjoy.  it's a dynamic, fighting game. these moves are all pretty common. the computer analysis shows this move, nf6, as not as precise as d6.  the gameknot database for the scotch shows only d6 as the book move here.  in 365chess.com, they show white winning ~79% of the time with the response of e5.  black cannot find a good place for his knight.  note how this one imprecise move by black causes it to lose time, while white develops nicely.  this corresponds to the advice i give to look for a mistake or lack of precision or sharpness in the opening, seize on it and relentlessly put pressure on your opponent. the opening book does show black's bf6 as possible.   the computer analysis shows this continuation (rather than e5):   6. nc3 d6 7. bg5 be7 8. o-o-o o-o 9. e5 ng4 10. bxe7 qxe7 11. exd6 qxd6 12. qxd6 cxd6 13. rxd6 nxf2  i like the immediate pressure that e5 creates. th computer analysis liked  c5 rather than qe7:  c5 7. qe3 nd5 8. qe4 nb4 9. nc3 be7 10. bc4 o-o 11. be3 qb6 12. o-o-o kh8 13. nd5 nxd5 14. bxd5 freeing the e pawn to threaten black's knight, and developing.  but the computer analysis calls this a mistake on my part.  it liked be3, with this continuation:    7. be3 ng8 8. nc3 qb4 9. o-o-o qxd4 10. bxd4 nh6 11. nd5 kd8 12. be3 nf5 13. bg5+ ne7 14. bc4 h6 15. nxe7 bxe7 black has lost a lot of time.  look at the development of white's and black's positions.  the computer analysis preferred c5:    c5 8. exf6 qxe2+ 9. kxe2 cxd4 10. na3 b6 11. re1 gxf6 12. nb5 ba6 13. kd1+ kd8 14. nxd4 bc5 15. be3 re8 16. nf5 bb4 17. c3 white is far better developed. white is not ready to exchange its queen, nicely in the center, and not so easily scared away. so this is black's plan: to develop and put pressure on e5, and claim the long diagonal. threatening the c7 square with a fork on the king and queen's rook. or possibly checking the king later at f6 (if supported by white, say with its queen bishop).    centralized, the knight is commanding and widely threatening.    too bad that black's queen is guarding c7. what can white do? the computer analysis calls a6 a blunder, preferring ne7:  ne7 12. nf6+ kd8 13. rd1 bxf6 14. exf6 nf5 15. bc4 re8 16. qd5 qb6 17. qxf7 nd6 18. qd5 nxc4 19. qxc4 qxf6  black is behind in development and needs to get its pieces deployed.  white is in it face with nd5 and black needs to counter that.   a6 falls far short. white sees an opportunity to get the black queen off the c file and maybe to trap the black queen. black needs to protect the c7 pawn. white continues to harass the queen. now white has its king's bishop in the game!  if qxb5??, then nxc7+ forking not just the king and rook, but the queen, too! nowhere else to go!  black's queen is where it was six moves ago, but meanwhile white's pieces continue to develop and attack. now the queen bishop is developed and attacking.    where can the black queen go to escape? the computer analysis calls qa3 a mistake.    it prefers accepting this loss of material, the queen for the knight and bishop:  qxd5 16. qxd5 c6 17. qc5 cxb5 18. rfe1 h6 19. bd4 rh7 20. qxb5 ne7 21. bc5 nd5 22. bd6 nc3 23. qc5 nxa2.  the computer is right about qxd5 being the better approach.  i was thinking qxd5, 16. qxd5 c6 17. qc5 cxb5 18. bg5 bf8 19. qxb5 ra6 20. rfd1 rc6 21. h4 h6  black is going to lose the exchange with his rook.  but, worse, look at white's pieces amazingly coming to the fore to attack the uncastled king.    black's lag in development has cost it big time.  if black's king went to d8, then white might respond 17 bb6, ne7; 18. rfb1, nf5; 19 rb3, qe7 and 20 nxa8+ and the black king is back at e8. white doesn't find anything better to do than take the rook. black recaptures with it queen.    at the time of the game, i thought that black needed to do something else, but the computer does not show this as an error.  how about . . .d6 18 nb6 qa5 19. nxc8 qxb5 20. nxd6 ne7 21. rfd1 nc6 the computer analysis calls black's move a blunder, preferring d6.  it's mate in 5 the analysis says:  . . . ke8  19. e6 be5 20. exd7+ bxd7 21. qxe5+ kd8  22. bb6+ kc8 23. qct#  the d6 continuation goes this way per the computer:  … d6 19. rfd1 bh6 20. exd6 bd7 21. bxd7 bg5 22. be8 bd8 23. d7+ ne7 24. bxe7+ bxe7 25. re1 bd8 26. qb4+ kg7 black resigns as he sees mate on the horizon.  morals of the story: 1) the scotch game is fun (for white) 2) develop, develop, develop 3) jump on early move inaccuracies, here black's nf6 at move 5. 
-------------------------------------
i open with my queen pawn. queens gambit. black accepts the queens gambit. rather unusual, i think it´s bad for black. gaining space in the center. you shall always do that if black accepts the gambit! theory so far! threatening my knight! counterthreat against blacks queen. white castles kingside. rather aggressive move, this! this move is to hazardous. black castles queenside, too risky with removed pawns in front of the king! not to recommend! threatens blacks queen! gains a pawn! now you can see the danger for blacks king along the open c-file! tricky move. was this retreat really necessary? when i look closer to the position, it seems like that i just could take the e-pawn there? now i take the e-pawn. threatens my queen, but misses something essential! a discovered double-check! wins a piece for free, but it will be worse for black, much worse! at first i didn´t saw this crushing move, but then i discovered it! black must take with his queen! but it doesn´t help black! mate in one, can you see it? desperation! i only takes the queen and now checkmate! immediately after i finished this amazing game i thinked, i must annotate this game! as i can see, black castled in the wrong direction, if he had castled kingside i think it had been a whole different story! 
-------------------------------------
i had to choose here.. allowing the knight on e4 or not. i prefer not to but to make him able to play for it. he has to play g5 .. that way his kingside is weakened so i decided to allow it. this move gives the bisschop beeing on g3 more power so i totally did not mind. and there we go if he opens my f file now, i will be a happy man this position doesn't look very healthy for white but it gives me a lot of tactical options. the knight on d7 doesnt have many squares to go too as example, his position is kind a locked.  all i can do at this point is building up some pressure and back to d7 where it belongs :p black looks to be out of problems here not sure if both sides playd the best moves here but i think white is position is really strong now.. black is pulled back.. white has a strong f file the queen must stay at d7 for a bit cause of the checkmate with qf7x if black queens move to d8. d7 is the only allowed square for black. plan is easy.. the queen is still not allowed to go to d8. to be honest.. i was really thinking i had wun here.. but then he playd rook g7.. that move was earlier a bad move cause my bisschop is attacking g7. but the bisschop diagnol is blocked now lets build up something new ;) knight h7 is taking care of the f6 square. if i allow black to move up that f pawn.. he will be relieved of his problems .. i didn't want that ;) he has to be carefull now. his knight has no squares to go too..  one attacker, one defender 2 attackers one defender still.. blunder. he could defend his knight ones more by playing king g8 or to move up the f pawn i dont the idea about this move but it gives me more advantages and i win the offered rook back cause the king can´t defend it anymore. and he resigned

-------------------------------------
sicilian defence is my favorite. because of it i play 1.d4 - don't want to switch sides. there are a lot of possibilities here. i usually prefer nc6 because want to keep pressure on d4. it is not guarantee something - just i used to play like this. for example, i also prefer nimzo-indian defence or grünfeld defence- always keep pressure on white position.  i am very happy when people play this variation. bb5 and c3 are more boring. keeping pressure.  i love this variation.  usually white play ndb5. 
-------------------------------------
this is a game i lost. i underestimated my opponent's attack. it's a sicilian, rossolimo variation. i never thought it was a particularly offensive variation, but i had to change my mind. i have a solid center, a rook on an open file, i can't complain overall. the thing is, my pieces are drifting away from the king-side, and i am not thinking of aggressive resources of my opponent at all. i think this move is already a bit unconventional. first, 10. ... a5 fit better the idea of queen-side attack. second, black has to think about what will happen when white will push forward the e-pawn. and i am not doing that. this is an attempt to open the center which i consider now not likely to work. and that's the reason. white's pieces are better placed. i did not resign to the knight dominating the center. this weakens the castle: the black should worry more about gaining some space to maneuver, before opening the lines. the bitter truth. e6 will become a far too easy target, if the black takes the pawn otherwise. this unduly concedes f5. the black must call the far-away forces to the king-side: 17. … rbe8 18. qh6 qf7. the c4 pawn and the black bishop are laughable. 18. ... qf7?? 19. nh6+ trying to breath. this is an educational example: one of those situations in which it really matters what rook you move. … rbd8 21. re3 kh8 22. ne7 rg8 23. nxg8 rxg8 somehow resisted. black resigns. so if you're attacked, don't forget: seek space and bring the pieces to the bombed area! 
-------------------------------------
we play the nimzo-indian defense. i like to fianchetto my bishops if possible. here it is somewhat delayed. it´s still kind of even. white are soon ready to the pawn push e4. this move will also make my c4 pawn weak.  because i take back with my e-rook instead of the pawn, i´m avoiding to isolate and weaken my c-pawn. i also have some vague ideas about starting an attack against whites castled king in the future.  now begins the trickiest part of the game, with much threats and counterthreats, and maneuvers back and forth! aiming at the h3-pawn. now the long anticipated pawn push gets a reality. tricky position. after a long pondering i find this the best move. this move is not so pleasant for me. white gains space here. probably better for white was exd5. i can´t take back with my bishop, if i do that i loose my e-rook! white probably missed that! threatening my d5-pawn. combining attack and defense. now my d5-pawn falls! but i can live with that. for now i begin to impose a serious threat against whites king.  a good defensive move. again combining attack and defense.  a handy rook lift. threatening disaster along the g-file. i was here pondering pretty long time, accept or reject the sacrifice? but decides to take it. white wins a bishop back, but still i´m up in material. to be a knight up is always nice. especially when the endgame is near. to trade queens are the easiest way to win. white tries! white gives up. and that is right. he is completely lost now.

my opponent open the game with her e-pawn. mi oponente comienza el juego con su peón e. the french defense, when the black try to attack the e-pawn with d-pawn. la defensa francesa, donde las negras intentar atacar el peón e con su peón d. another alternatives to this move are: qe2 (tschigorin´s attack), b3 (tartakower´s attack), nf3 d5 3 e5 c5 4 b4 (wing´s gambit) and the indian atack. entre otras alternativas a este movimiento tenemos: de2 (ataque tschigorin), b3 (ataque tartakower), cf3 d5 3 e5  c5 4 b4 (gambito del ala) y el ataque indio de rey. exchange variation, in the most popular lineas, white try to tend a simetrical position of pawns, but my opponent will play aggresive. white can play too: e5 (advance variation), nd2 (tarrasch variation) and nc3 (clasical variation). variante del cambio, que en sus más populares líneas, las blancas juegan estructuras de peones simétricas, aunque este no será el caso. también pueden jugar: e5 (variante del avance), cd2 (variante tarrasch) y cc3 (variante clásica). this move attacks the black center but the d-pawn is now a weakness. i think what c6 do not offer adventage to the black and dxc4 allows bxc4 with initiative. so, nf6 with development and allows castle. este movimiento ataca el centro negro, pero el peón en d4 es ahora una debilidad. creo que c6 ahora no ofrece ventajas, por remitir a una estructura simétrica, y que tomar el peón cede la iniciativa al adversario. mejor desarrollar el caballo e intentar enrocar. more pressure to d5. i will try to put a rook in the e column. más presión sobre el peón central, mi idea ahora era enrocar y colocar una torre en la columna abierta. now, i can play dxc4 winning a move, but i do not desagreed this position. the weaknees in the d4-pawn is the caractheric to the position and white will try to compensate. ahora, podría tomar el peón c, ganando un tiempo, pero no me disgusta la posición, la debilidad en el peón central es la característica de la posición y las blancas deberan ingeniarselas para compersalo. this move allows the next move with two threats. may be better are nge2 with castle. este movimiento permite la siguiente maniobra con fuerza, mejor seguramente era desarrollar el caballo rey y enrocar. threats d4 and b4. amenaza b4 y d4. i do not understand this maniuvre. better nge2. no comprendo esta maniobra, mejor era el otro caballo. now, black had adventage in pawn´structure and development, his king is safe. black is better. ahora, las blancas están mejor porque poseen mejor desarrollo y mejor estructura de peones, asi como su rey está seguro.  better be3. mejor ae3 if nxd4, bb4+ and mate in the next. si cxd4, ab4+ y mate en la próxima i play this move to development the ligth bishop to f5 (seeing c2) and protect the knitgh with the queen. two ideas and a only move, must be strong. jugué este movimiento con la idea de colocar el alfil de casillas claras en f5, atacando c2 junto con el caballo, y defender mi caballo con la dama. dos ideas en una sola jugada, debe de ser buena. now, black has a winning position, but the next move is a blunder, best is bb3. advantage in material, white´s king in the center and pressure in both open columns, i will try to exchange the active pieces, to try reduce the counterstrike. con ventaja en material, el rey en el centro y presión en ambas columnas abiertas, intentaré cambiar las piezas activas para restringir el contrajuego. if 23 fxe3 qxe3 24 qd1 qf2++ or 24 kd1 qxe2++.

latvian counter gambit i have done nd8 in a past game which did not fair well for me. here i did re8+ which seems like an aggressive move.  i have won all my past games doing this move. other options to consider include: qe4+ and nf6.  engine analysis suggests nge7 followed by: 12. dxc6+ bxc6 13. qd4 nd5 14. nc3 re8+ 15. ne3 nxe3 16. bxe3 qe6 17. kf2 qf5+ 18. kg1 c5 19. bb5+ kc8 exactly like my previous games white responds with 12. be3.  upon further calculations though ne3 gives white an even better advantage. the mistake: qe4 13. dxc6+ bxc6 14. nxa7 d5 15. bd3 qxg2 16. nb6+ cxb6 17. qxc6+ ke7 18. rf1 qxh2 19. qb7+ bd7 20. qxb6 nf6  although black is still at a disadvantage qf6 13. dxc6+ bxc6 14. nd4 d5 15. na5 rxe3+ 16. qxe3 bb4+ 17. c3 bxa5 18. h3 bh5 19. ba6 c5 20. bb5+ kc8 21. qe6+ qxe6+ 22. nxe6 gives a closer game. again i am following my old game lines. … d5 15. bd3 qxg2 16. nb6+ cxb6 17. qxc6+ ke7 18. rf1 nf6 19. qc7+ ke6 20. nc6 be7 21. bxb6 kf7 22. nd4 is not very good looking for black.  improvement: … nf6 15. bd3 qxg2 16. rf1 qxh2 17. nb6+ cxb6 18. qxc6+ ke7 19. qc7+ ke6 20. bc4+ ke5 21. nc6+ ke4 22. bd3+ kd5 23. ne7+ ke6 24. bc4+ ke5 still lines played from my previous games.  here white makes the error: 16. ne5+ rxe5 17. qxc6+ ke7 18. qxc7+ ke6 19. qb6+ kf7 20. rf1+ nf6 21. nc6 re4 22. rf2 qh1+ 23. bf1 bf3 24. qc7+ kg8 25. qb6  best would be: 16. nb6+ cxb6 17. qxc6+ ke7 18. rf1 nf6 19. qc7+ ke6 20. nc6 bc5 21. qxg7 rhf8 22. rg1 qxh2 23. bxc5 bxc5 24. rxg4 nxg4 25. qxg4+ awful mistake by me.  ...ke6 is a much safer location.

this is the recommended way of playing the semi-slav according to american im larry kaufman in his excellent book 'the chess advantage in black and white' (mckay chess library, 2004). kaufman's repertoire opening book is worth having a look at if you're searching for practical openings that aren't too analysed to death (najdorf, sveshnikov etc) or too drawish. the point of 3...c6 instead of 3...nf6 is to avoid the queens gambit declined exchange variation (4.cxd4) which is supposedly good for white because he hasn't yet committed his kings knight (to f3), so can more easily play f3 and e4 (after e3, bd3 and ne2-g3 etc). this move order means that black has to be prepared for the marshall gambit (4.e4) which is tricky but, for a clued-up black player, is probably not quite sound (though i have been on the wrong end of this in an over-the-board game!). now black has a choice. 5...be7 is super-solid and can lead to the lasker defence, the classical or the tartakower; 5...nbd7 can lead to a classical or cambridge springs set-up (black plays 6...qa5, which usually gives black the two bishops (after bxf6) but allows white to keep an edge). instead, the move i chose is the whole point of the semi-slav's c6 and e6 (a plan to take on c4 either to hold onto the pawn with b5 or, after white plays bxc4, to hit the bishop with b5 and follow up with bb7, a6 and a later c5). this leads to a razor-sharp position. black snags a pawn, but now white can set up a classic pawn centre (pawns on e4 and d4) with an immediate threat of 7.e5 . . . which white does. this is the ambitious (and only real) way of playing, holding onto the pawn. it does, however, invite the enormous complications of the botvinnik variation, which is nicely explained in glenn flear's interesting book 'starting out: slav and semi-slav' (everyman, 2005). please note, however, that this book is five years old, which is light years when it comes to slav and semi-slav opening theory. kaufman, instead, recommends avoiding the botvinnik by playing 5...h6 (this is called the moscow variation). however, the anti-moscow gambit (in which white gives up a pawn after 6.bh4 g5 7.bg3 dxc4) gives white a lasting positional advantage and is not easy to play against. the only move to prevent the loss of a piece. ditto. white's usual move here is 11.exf6, when 11...nxf6 would leave black's remaining knight stuck in a terribly inconvenient pin and would not be recommended. after 11.exf6 black invariably plays 11...bb7. because white delays taking on f6 by one move, black has an interesting alternative to committing the bishop to the b7 square (according to flear). this is it, to which flear attaches an exclamation mark: 11...qa5! like most players, i love to play moves with such a suffix. flear says: "the bishop on a6 defends the c-pawn and is part of a plan to rapidly mobilise the queenside." i couldn't understand this move (and still don't). it seems entirely natural to play 14.bg2 (especially after 11.g3). in the source game of this variation (in which mikhail botvinnik beat arnold denker in the famous ussr-usa radio match of 1945), denker put his bishop on e2 and was crushed (and that was with the g-pawn remaining on g2). however, according to flear, 14.qf3 is the move to play, presumably to x-ray target the c6 pawn and keep the white bishop on the f1-a6 diagonal for the time being. i can't remember why i played this instead of 14...0-0-0. i recall seeing a number of games in which white managed to get a pawn to e7 with a fork on two pieces, and figured that the king might be useful in the centre. in hindsight, i'm not sure this was a great move. a double attack on the c4 pawn, but i'm not sure moving the queen away from the d1-h5 diagonal was a good idea (also, the queen is no longer defending the e2 bishop and the d3 square is weakened). in this opening black is pretty well committed to attack as the best form of defence. this move, as well as hitting white's only central pawn, also opens the a8-h1 diagonal for black's qb. white takes up the challenge. i figured that this move prevents white from castling (the e2 bishop is then hanging) and if 17.bxa6 qxa6, white still can't castle and has waves of weak white squares flooding around his king. i was expecting 18.e7 when (as mentioned earlier) a white pawn makes its way to the seventh rank with a fork. i'm sure this is weaker. it gives a check and, on the face of it, exposes the black king on the kingside. but the f6 pawn actually acts as a useful shield, and, meanwhile, black has strong central and queenside threats. one interesting variation could be: 18.e7 bxe2 19.exd8=q+ qxd8 20.qe3 (20.kxe2?? qd3+ 21.ke1 nf3 mate) 20...cxb2 21.kxe2 bxa1=q 22.rxa1 rxh2 23.nxc5 when 23...qd5 (centralising the queen) looks to be about equal. this means white cannot castle except 'by hand' (kf1-g2-re1). but that takes three moves and, right now, it's black who has a lead in development (and those white squares are still desperately weak). logical. the black queen moves to a white diagonal. note how much control black has over the crucial d3 square. white hastens to block the diagonal (even if only for a moment). why play this move, giving up a pawn? firstly, 21.ke1?? allows 21...nf3 mate! and 21.ke3?? leads to 21...qd3+ 22.kf4 qf3+ 23.kxe5 re8+ 24.kd5 qxe4 mate (those white squares again). after 21...nxc4, white can play 22.kf3 and try to get the king to g2 (probably the best option). if 22.kf1, then 22...nd6+ wins the white knight. and 22.ke1 invites 22...ne5 targeting the f3 square and, more crucially, a royal fork on d3. i really liked this move. yet again it's a tempo gainer (the obvious threat is 22...rxe5+). also, taking with the rook on c4 is now a very nasty threat because a) it gains a tempo by attacking white's queen on c1, and b) a subsequent discovered check with a rook move is brutal. meanwhile, because the black knight is still on e5 the king plan of f3 and g2 is impossible. to stop the rook taking the c4 pawn. 23.nxc4 rxc4 leads to the same assessment of the rook discovered check. now the black queen comes to the e-file with a gain of tempo. this wasn't a difficult move to find. a check, after all, is a check. bang goes the defender of the f3 square. and now a double attack (on the bishop on d2 and the rook on h1). black's reply is forced. the rook finally arrives at c4 with tempo, and eyes up the c2 square. i thought this was a strong move, but didn't quite appreciate how strong until i started to examine the white queen's options for retreating from the attack. an unfortunate necessity. other queen moves lead to a debacle: 22.qb1 rc2+ 23.kd1 (ke1 then qxh1+) qd3+ followed by mate on e2; 22.qd1 rc2+ 23.kf1 (or e1) qxh1+. 22.qd2 or b2 and the black rook going to c2 is decisive. obvious. the idea behind this move is to exchange the e3 bishop which is the glue holding together white's defence. the rook reaches c2 and it's all over because of the twin threats of 31...qf3+ and 31...qd3+ (note, those white squares again). fitting, i think, that mate is given on e2, the square on which white's kb should probably have never visited.  if you're looking for an opening to play against 1.d4 and 2.c4, then the semi-slav is rich in possibilities. obviously, you have to be clued up on the meran and the anti-meran (both covered in flear's and kaufman's books), but i've found that the positions you get with black always seem to be nicely unbalanced and offer chances of fighting for the initiative (a bit like playing the najdorf sicilian against 1.e4). the nimzo-indian also fits the bill against 1.d4 and 2.c4, but white can avoid it by not playing 3.nc3. personally, i don't much like playing the black side of the queens indian (3.nf3 b7), and the bogo-indian (3.nf3 bb4+) offers at least one forced variation which gives black a cramped position that, at best, is drawish. so my advice is: mug up on the semi-slav: ("there is one defense that does it all – the semi-slav" says kaufman).

just a warning that this game is full of mistakes and/or blunders but the analysis is done anyway to learn from mistakes. not that e6 is bad or anything but bxd3 is probably slightly better and gives both opponents a more even game. again not the best move but could not be considered bad. maybe developing a piece with na6 would be okay even if it looks somewhat odd. blunder.  after the following long line we see why this is: … ba5 13.  nd6+  kf8  14. bxh6 nf6  15. bxg7+ kxg7  16. qg5+ kf8  17. qxf6 rh7  18. ndc4 qd8  19. qf4 ke8  20. nxa5 qxa5  suggestion maybe … bf8 might defend the black kingside? this is a mistake if you look closer: 14. nd6+  kf8  15. bxh6 nf6  16. bxg7+ kxg7  17. qg5+ kf8  18. qxf6 rh7  19. ndc4 qd8  20. qf4 ke8  21. nxa5 qxa5 gives white a fairly big advantage. big blunder.  checkmate in 9 (… e5 17.  ne7+  kh8  18. bxh6 g5  19. hxg5 bxc3+  20. bxc3 fxg5  21. bg7+ kxg7  22. nxg5 nxg5  23. qg6+ kh8  24. rh3+ nxh3  25. qh6#).  another blunder... ne7+ kh8  19. bxh6 g5  20. hxg5 bxc3+  21. bxc3 fxg5  22. nxg5 exd4  23. bg7+ kxg7  24. qg6+ kh8  25. qxh7# gives white the win. small mistake 19. e6 seems more solid. … nxe5 would keep the game more even. blunder.  this move allows the opponent right back into the game.  however  22. qf5  red8  23. rxd8+ rxd8  24. nxe5 ne8  25. qe6+ kh7  26. nf7 qd7  27. ng5+ kh8  28. bxg7+ nxg7  29. nf7+ kg8  30. nxd8+ qxe6  31. nxe6 gives white a much bigger advantage.   mistake is seen here: 23. qe3  nxg3  24. qxg3 gxh6  25. ne7+ kh8  26. rd7 rxe7  27. rxc7 bxc7  28. qg6 rh7  29. qf6+ kg8  30. kc2  best move would keep the game even with: qg4 nxg3  24. fxg3 rad8  25. rxd8 rxd8  26. qe6+ qf7  27. ne7+ kf8  28. ng6+ kg8 mistake i believe... better is … gxh6 24.  b4  bb6. … rd5 29.  qe2  bb6 should be considered.   30. be5  kf7  31. bd4 qd5 blunder... qg5 qd6  32. qg4 rdxe5  33. bxe5 qxe5  34. rf1 qf6  35. f4 rd8  36. rh1 qd6  37. h5 qd3+  38. ka1 bc5 blunder again.  … qd6 31.  qg4  rdxe5  32. bxe5 qxe5 blunder yet again.  32. nxd7  rxg5  33. bxg5 e3  34. nc5 e2  35. nd3 e1=q+  36. nxe1 bxe1  37. kc2 bg3  38. rd1 bf2  39. rd2 bc5  40. g4 would give white a clear advantage. smaller error because of the following… qe7 32.  qxe7  rxe7   mistake:  qxe7 rxe7  34. ng6 re6 is better. another mistake this game is now approaching to an end with black having the advantage.   although at this point the game is lost … e1=q+ would be the better promotion. after this there are still several mistakes done by the players but as said the game is over.  
-------------------------------------
opening moves, my opponent had chosen scillian defence najdorf variation which i am not much comfortable with.. i wanted to control a2-f7 diagonel with my bishop, hoping a future attack on f7 square or pin f7 square after he castles hmm.. my opponent has chosen to fiancetto his dark bishop on g7. it seems i will have to be careful on dark squares on this game. he wants to control dark squares. i didnt want him to play e6 which strenghts f7 square.also i thought i might want to change my bishop on g5 with his knight on f6 in the thought of controling the light squares. centerilizing my rook.. i was expecting nc6. but my opponent had some good plans.. developing my queen and conneting my rooks.. !! here i have to make a choice either i will stay on the a2-g8 diagonal or i will take my move back..good move from my opponent. he centerilized his knight on e5 and i had to retreat my bishop losing one tempo.. but luckily it s not the end yet..  i wanted to control the squares this evil knight can go with my bishop.   he might have played b5 first than fianchetto his light colored bishop in the direct attacking position on my king-side.  "rc8" very naturel move from my opponent. he wants to use half open file for rooks on behalf of black king. here i wanted to exchange some material as i felt some pressure because of his knight that resides on e5, but i wanted to put my knight on d5 first. this move might be bad because it turns black's dark square bishop to a monster because after giving up my bishop he can dance on the long diagonal as he likes he doesnt want to exchange his strong bishop with my centerilized knight because he wanted to do that with his other bishop.  so it is time to get rid of that knight from the center.. i didnt want to retreat my queen to c1 to defend my pawn. ı t would be real bad duty for excelancy:p nor i wanted to lose a pawn so i exchanged my bishop again i dont wanna lose a pawn, i started to feel his bishop's strenght... but luckily his queen and rook on f8 arent doing much here.  i have missed this move.he s attacking to my knight and giving me some hard time. but it weakens the d6 pawn. and d5 is a good outpost for my knights pinning my pawn. another attacking move. but wait a second what s his rook on f8 doing here? wouldnt it better if he played on re8! certainly! it would be naturel move. developing the rook towards to center.. 19-b3 attacking the rook. i think qd3 would do it better . and i could save my pawn from the pin. here i guess 20-b5 would be better.. after  20-...b5 , 21-nb4 bxf3 , 22-nxc6 bxd2 , 23 nxd8 bxe1, 24 nxe1 rxd8 25 rxd6 ... material would be even and it would be end game rook+bishop versus rook+knight.. actually i would have the advantage because of the pin on his bishop on d7. but didnt calculate further. wanted to find good suare for my queen and it was b4. she could have an eye on d6 and and b6 square that his queen can come with a check. so he didnt like my knight there. well positioned knight values rook. so he did a good job. here i didnt want to lose outpost square d5. also pinning the his weak pawn on d6 i am down a pawn and have to do sth to gain it back. this is the move will get rid of the bishop and leave e4 pawn for my knight.. he could play rb6 and after qa5  then simply bg7 attacking the knight! qb6 loses immediately after qxq followed by nd7! here i could just play 33-g5 because after 33 .. rf2+  ı would play kg3 then if he takes my pawn as a nice morsel rd8 followed by re8 and rg8 mate. he would have big trouble cause of that. i missed it. here i saw mating attack it but it s too late for that. i could play g3 with the same idea of mating threat i guess after this move my opponent felt he doesnt have a chance at all, so  he resigned.

francesa con miscelanea de ataque variado con jugadas constantemente inesperadas por el adversario. bombardeo al estilo capablanca logrando ventaja material listo para ganar el final. tengo la variante de cd y luego axa3 doblando el peon pero abriendo una columna que puede ser fatal para mi. luchando por controlar el centro del tablero jugada de contraataque para frenar un poco la agresividad del blanco ataque del balnco concluido sin èxito. ahora veàmos un poco !!! si da8, rf7 pierde mucho tiempo porque luego tiene que empezar a defenderse de todos modos y mejor hacer una jugada directa defensiva. rey seguro vale por 2 no creo que esa jugada sea buena se da cuenta del error y quiere eliminar mi dama pero.... linda combinaciòn !! se esconde como una rata . al ataque !!!!!  
-------------------------------------
  it is not mandatory. white have few other alternatives and the most promising is 2. nc3 leading (2. ... d5 3. nf3) to two knights variation or to spielmann attack (2. ... d5 3. qf3). other good alternative is steiner attack 2. c4!? white can select old indian like structure with 2. d3 (breyer variation or stein attack). rarely used moves are 2. ne2, 2. b3, 2. nf3, 2. f4 (with tranposition to advanced variation), 2. g3, 2. bc4?! (hillbilly attack) and 2. qe2 (in russian book, i found that it was proposed by "нипхауз", but i can't identify that master - (niphouse?) )  caro kan defence -- good even for blitz!
-------------------------------------
 asymmetric pawn structure in the center define plans: a) initiative of white at king wing (e-file and e5 square); b) attack of black’s pawn minority at queen wing (b7-b5-b4) and pressure using c file. and black can organize their minority attack easier than white - to attack at king wing (related to some level of risk).

-------------------------------------
e6 ?? d6 o c6 encerrado en la jugada 14 por causa de un error teòrico me doy cuenta que me està jugando con mucha cautela pero se olvida de conceptos de escuela: punto debil a la vista en d6 es logico tomar con este peon o de lo contrario dxd8 , txd8 y axe7 evitando h6 y dejando espacio en d1 para mi torre para quitarse la presiòn del alfil atacando el punto dèbil me abre la diagonal al alfil blanco y este hace presiòn sobre otro punto debil en f7 sigo inhabilitando el caballo y provocando mas y mas jugadas defensivas error !! pienso que rh8 era mejor que esa ataque al otro punto debil. me he dado cuenta que esta partida el ataque o la iniciativa solo viene de un lado. otro error dentro de la desesperación y la asfixia unica jugada para defender su alfil concepto de escuela !!  gran jugada para evitar el ataque esperado simplificar sy hay ventaja decisiva. otro oncepto de escuela !! ataque final si cxf7 ? re6 mejor aquì ! las negras se rinden !

scandinavian (centre counter) defence (b01) scandinavian defence, lasker variation (b01) här lämnar svart scandinavian defence, lasker variation (b01). 6...be7 hade varit i den linjen här tänkte jag först parera vits s med h3, men det är inte så bråttom med den paraden. dessutom kan vit sätta min l på c4 i knipa genom att göra b5. min l måste kunna retirera, så draget blir därefter. när jag slår hans s på d4, så kan vi hoppas på att han slår min s med d. då slår jag med l på b5 och schackar. när han sedan säkrar k så kniper jag d. ok, då kör jag med ett mothot på f7 mot hans t. sätter min d i spel, och öppnar upp för kombinationer. slår han min s på c3 så slår jag hans t på a8. säkrar han t så säkrar jag s. justja, höll på att missa denna finfina gaffel tidigare. men så länge man upptäcker möjligheterna i tid, så är man på säker mark. han parerar smart, så vi tar en bonde under tiden. avleder samtidigt l, men sannolikt slår han min s på c6 och då slår jag med d på c6 och schackar. avledningen gick hem, så jag tar hans d. sedan slår han förmodligen mitt t med l. slår han s med t så går jag med d till c6+ och sedan tar jag hans l. slår han s med k så säkrar jag f-t till d1+, efter k till c7 så säkrar jag s till e4. finemang, han kunde motstå frestelsen att knipa mitt t. då har jag en manöver som återger mig en hel del material, från att schacka med d på c6. slår han s med k, så slår jag bonden på c7 och kungsgafflar med t. här har jag lite bråttom, för t till d1 hade skurit av svarts k bättre. men jag spelar godkänt med d till c7+ han kommer säkert att parera t med s till d7, men då kungsgafflar jag  på c6. som förväntat, och jag har lite bråttom igen. här hade s till d5 varit starkare, eftersom det hade tvingat hans k att fly till f6 och blivit mer inträngd. materiellt tänkt, men ok som drag. nu flyr svarts k till f6 iaf, men jag är sugen på hans t. spelar materiellt igen med s. här vinner jag mer tempo på att schacka med s på e4, så jag hejdar mitt materiella tänkande en stund. försöker han dubbelhota med k på f5, så går jag bara upp med d och schackar på e5. det tränger honom längre in mot h-kanten. han viker undan, så jag passar på att knipa hans l. här är det befogat med en sådan manöver. en rad alternativ står till buds, men jag väljer att skära av diagonalen d8-h4. backar han eller går han till h5 ? han backar till h7, och skyddar samtidigt sitt t om han skulle vilja aktivera l. här hade antagligen d till d3 varit bäst först och sedan s-manövern, men jag valde s-manövern först. slår han med l, så slår jag tillbaka med d. går han upp med g5, så slår jag antingen med s mot f7 eller så säkrar jag l på e3.  * här gav svart upp kampen. en aning för tidigt dock, för jag kunde inte se någon direkt matt inom de närmsta 5 dragen iaf.

-------------------------------------
i probably face 1.e4 more than any other opening move in correspondence chess. either acolytes of "best by test" or lots of people prefer open games to closed games. as for me, i prefer semi-open or closed games :-) by eschewing 2.d4 my opponent is inviting any one of a number of unorthodox moves to avoid any mainline french theory.  i do not oblige him. so d4 is finally played and we have the beginning of a familiar/drawish french exchange setup. 6...bg4 is playful more than anything else. there are a number of other moves just as good and more solid, but i'm sensing my opponent is hoping for just that: solid defensive play. better to play around and see if any holes develop! i've already goaded him! ? this is a mistake that should cost me a pawn. i took my opponent's previous move as cautious and complacent and so i started really horsing around when i'm now in serious danger of blowing the opening. the continuation to lose the pawn would be: 9.g4 bg6 10.g5 nh5 11.nxd5 here, i thought my opponent saw it and i was close to resigning already. thankfully, my favorite chess motto is "never resign!" aha! 10.g5 is missed and so now i have a chance to save my loose pawn. i'm not sure what my opponent hopes to gain here as the pawn is already bolstered on the g5 square by the dsb. as we will see, the rook is misplaced, not only in preventing castling, but will need to defend h2 very soon. protecting the d5 pawn from 11.g5 at this point it's becoming clear that my opponent is not entirely sure what to do with me. i haven't castled yet, nor i have i made any threatening moves. it's like we're both waiting for the other to do something. i, however, have already been planning. his kingside is a shambles, i must provoke to start stirring the pot. i love this move! the white king is still stuck in the center (i can castle at my leisure) and now my knight occupies the valuable real estate at e4. he can't be exchanged for the knight at c3 because of the impending pawn fork, but exchanging him for the lsb is almost worse since then my bishop pair gives me a lot more latitude should the position open up. the best thing for the moment would be to just leave him there, except that should i exchange at c3, the queenside gets airy and the white king has nowhere to go should things get ugly. my opponent cannot risk being unable to castle and so gambles the longterm threat of my bishop pair (and potential light square weaknesses) against removing the threat immediately and maybe even winning the soon-to-be black e4 pawn in the process. making his bid for the e4 pawn clear. now we see the misplaced rook. this also give me the option to castle queenside if i so choose. my king has lots of options, his king is stuck! correcting the error as best he can. i would prefer 14.rg2 myself, although that would be a mistake if he pushed the g-pawn, which he later does. so the best he could do given his situation and inclinations. this is a gamble. i'm hoping to provoke a response, buying time for a longterm defense of the pawn and keeping my opponent's position cramped. should he ignore my e-pawn and try to develop his king to the queenside a very different game than the one i imagined should arise. he takes the bait! the pawn can now be taken, but not without serious consequences: 16.nxe4 nxe3 17.fxe3 bxe4 18.nxe4 bxg5 ... if now 19.nxg5 then 19...qg3+ pickes up the knight, an extra pawn, and leaves the king dislodged on his decimated kingside. not a won game to be sure, but an uncomfortable one, all things considered. my opponent would rather not engage in the tactical exchange-fest, but it's all to the good for me. now that e-pawn is there for a good long while :-) still hoping to castle queenside and regain some semblance of stability and development. however, looking at the board now, only two pieces remain on white squares. it will be open season for my lsb. i took days for me to make this move. the idea was that if my opponent did castle queenside, he wouldn't be able to assault my king without risking his own fortress. also, the kingside is a shambles for him now, but if i castled there he could quickly turn this to his advantage sending the heavy artillery behind those advanced/advancing pawns...with my bishops in the way. i took this as an indication he would attack the queenside, now that he knew where my king would be. giving more squares for my lsb to play with, also reminding him if he doesn't want to lose his a-pawn he need to keep his rook right where it is, out of the action. hard to fathom by the end, but here it makes perfect sense. connects the rooks, and keeps his king out of the theater he means to attack at any moment. this d-pawn needs defending if i'm to develop my rook to b6 like i plan. castling would have prevented this move, which looks threatening, what with my queen and king on the same file and his d2 knight to bolster the advance. oops. so suddenly the c-file is no longer viable and the a-file is the next target. i'm guessing my opponent by this point doesn't like closed positions at all. i love this move, too! the white squares are a veritable smörgåsbord of threats and access for not only my lsb, but now my queen. justifying the rook to a1. the c-file will open up at some point, and when it does i need a rook here. a bad move. the pawn on a4 provided a necessary stop-gap on the a6-f1 diagonal. that stop-gap is now gone. ouch, that hurts. my opponent took forever when he saw this move. i'm guessing for several reasons. i don't need him picking up an extra check like i just did if he were to play 25.bf4, and i also need my king off the b8 square in case he gets any ideas to continue advancing the a-pawn while i'm messing around. also, what does he do now? what moves are available to him? not what i would have played, but then what are his options? i had thought a while on my opponent's previous move and it occurred to me that e2 is the mating square now. i just need a bishop bolstering my queen and the game is over. so after this move, i need rhd8, bd7, bb5, qe2 checkmate. this isn't what happens, but this plan will allow something just as cool to come to fruition shortly. seems reasonable, but totally unnecessary as my queen has an adequate escape square. the first step of my plan. part of what i had been banking on was a free move i would get with bd7 threatening the queen. that extra move ("the most powerful weapon in chess" - bronstein) is now gone, so best to retreat and go back to the drawing board. also, the d-pawn and e-pawns are loose if i play 27...bd7 now. in this position i'm guessing my opponent would have accepted a draw if i offered one. or maybe not. he didn't offer me one. so we will free up some squares for my other bishop! also, this diverts the action back to the kingside to give my opponent as many headaches as possible. ?? the game is now lost. a simple pawn move and it's over. here the light square weakness is fully revealed as most of the moves that follow are forced. my opponent must now prevent mate in one. 30.nc4 also works, at which point i would have played 30...rxc4, giving me a rook move (anywhere!) that threatens mate-in-one. i also considered 30.f3 as a possible response, but that just loses a pawn as the pawn supports the mate-in-one just as well as the bishop. no more checks until the end, but it's like check in that the threat of mate forces very particular responses. again, if my opponent takes with the knight i take with my rook and i have that dangerous rook move interposing mate. what else does he have? this way he can at least meet the threat at e2, but the queen can't do everything, but she's the only piece that can do anything. time to overburden! the blasted e4 pawn is finally dispatched...far too late. the goal so far has been to avoid mate and egregious loss of material, but the position was such that you can't have your cake and eat it too. material has been saved, but now the game is over beyond a doubt. the final stroke. there are five ways to interpose between the bishop and king, and they all lose by force (in various variations), as does taking the bishop (since the queen gives up protection of e2). amazingly, material is even in this final position, but my bishop pair, domination of the light squares, and my opponent's stranded king gave me a distinct advantage that directed play and created an unbeatable winning game (after the blunder on 29.h4). one of the more satisfying games i've played against near-equal competition. 
-------------------------------------
one of my best games , let´s see. my regular move e5 , because i like it. nc6 to defend the pawn. opening and attacking , i wanted to get my queen out - possible if he capture my pawn  here it is , now the bishop is under attack great move , defends the bishop and attacks my queen i had to go back with my queen h6 , to make it impossible to move the knight to g5 nice move - attacking the pawn  i didn´t realise it , so i moved bd7 to defend my knight after this move i expected bf4 that´s why i moved g5 i lost my knight no problem - recapture waiting for the next step , white is in a better position in my opinion - king in safe , knights out ,... he is dominating now , so i am waiting ... that´s not a good move for me ...  i needed to make o-o-o to get my king out of the e-line because of the rock on e1  honestly , i didn´t know the purpose of this move my big mistake   ... look  i need to defend my rock equal exchange  good move i don´t have any possibilities , just one to take the knight it looks like the white is in a better position , but i have a better chance - checkmate in 2 moves this is the time when i took the lead in the game , white must block the possible checkmate - he has more solutions... fortunately he did the best move for me... check and after that... i took the rock now the game is mine that was not a good move, instead , the white could make a better move checkmate position the white is forced to move there i moved my queen there to take his pawn h3 another bad move in my opinion and from here it is easy it was a good game , i think the white had more possibilities to win and better positions during the game , but finally i was a bit lucky , but also i defend the attacks successfully and finished it with checkmate. nice play

well this game started with an classic opening, e4 which not gave e5 as it use to be and the possibility to to capture blacks e-pawn by en´passant went possible but how next move in that case should become stopped me from doing it i could also have threated pawn at e5 by qh5 but thought to save that move to future in this game here did i opened for chance to check by qh5+  and here does opening for the rook comes but the way to check by qh5 got stopped by this move and here is the first check in this game and here is the second check, moving kd7 had probably been the best move for black but by this move so is check-mate possible and here is the game ended in check-mate

uncommon, to say the least (0.5% occurrence) in my db. i trust you are using the gameknot database to find the right moves in the opening? it is *extremely* important that you all remember to do that; it will save you much grief ... as i know from personal experience.  very good - and entirely correct. gameknot may have recommended this to you, but i am betting you could find this move on your own as well. why? because advancing the e-pawn gives you a firm grip on the center, takes away d5 from him, gives you easy development of your lsb (light-squared bishop), an additional diagonal of infiuence for your queen, and contests control of f5. an impressive list, yes? but then, good moves will usually serve several purposes! and guess what - that *is* a very, very good way of finding the good moves in any position: select a move which serves multiple purposes.  gameknot correctly evaluates an advantage to you in this position. indeed, according to my database you should now have an approx. 82.5% chance of winning. of course, that number includes your opponent playing less than optimally ... but it does indicate that your position is clearly favourable. however, we really need neither engines nor databases to tell us that; simply look at the position: white: more space, more developed pieces, easier development, more mobile pieces (your bishops control far more squares than his!), better center control. good! always finish development and castle *before* doing something drastic! (and no, that is not an advice that i am especially good at following myself - unfortunately...)  so, in light of what i just wrote, why is black then wasting valuable time doing this? shouldn't he concentrate on getting his king castled instead? well, yes. however, this move does have the advantage of contesting your space advantage on the queen-side, and you will be forced to spend a move responding to that. so it doesn't really cost him anything - directly. however, as the game continuation shows, he will be more or less forced to follow up with a5 to support that pawn, and *that* move will cost him time better spent elsewhere. for that reason, i believe b5 is a strategic mistake. gameknot agrees with that assessment, by the way, adding to your evaluated positional advantage.  good! you are already castled and almost fully developed, while he still must spend at least 2 moves to get his king away. any complications are likely to favour you, for that reason.  however, this is likely a waste of time. why did you make that move? he is going to move the king away from the e-file rather immediately, and you have little hope of gaining control of it even if you do succeed in opening it. i think it would be more logical to continue what you already started and fire up the queen-side some more... axb seems a reasonable continuation (as gameknot also suggests), but you might also take a close look at moves like d5! again: any opening of the center, while he remains uncastled, is highly likely to favour you.  for the same reason, this seems to be a mistake. he should have castled. gameknot suggests bxa4 as the better alternative, but i wouldn't trust its evaluation of the position here. on the other hand gameknot is *great* at evaluation tactical complications! and its suggestion of 12.d5 exd5 13.cxb4 dxe4 14.qd4! is very interesting.   this is entirely correct; there is no reason to doubt this move: it mobilizes your dsb, adds pressure on the important diagonal to c7, and adds weight to any center thrust you might make. this is a good move. and this is also correct: you break up the center while his king is still not castled - which means he must waste a move, at some point, getting his king away. the more pressure you bring to bear on him, the more that wasted move will cost him. this however is a mistake. you can see why? the bishop - on g3 it will have only a single square of control (h4). additionallym, if moving it to g3 is to have any meaning, it should be because the pawn advance f2-f4 is planned and the bishop is needed to support that. however, until and unless that advance happens, the bishop is going to be severely handicapped: essentially, white is now playing a bishop down. on e3 it would be far more powerful, able to support any f-pawn advance while also bidding to take control of the very important (because: weak and influential!) c5 square.  or, as you see here: with the bishop on e3 this move would have been impossible. a useful waiting move, giving some 'luft' (air) to the king and a square of retreat for the bishop. it still feels trapped though.  and this will effectively prevent any immediate advance to f4... let me belabour the point a bit more ... ;)  on g3 the bishop is chewing granite - the pawn on e5 is protected and not likely to fall anytime soon. on e3 it would be biting into soft cheese: the virtually unprotected pawn on c5.  white needs to affect a breakthrough somewhere, but i am not convinced this is the best way to do it; white's pieces are awkwardly placed and will need time to take advantage of the break. now, while the position remains closed, time is not of much essence. white, as well as black, can generally take the time he needs to move his pieces about. after all, the opponent is severely restricted and cannot easily get to you. what does matter is the effective positioning of your pieces - both in defence and in offence. because, once the break comes - as it must if the game is not to be drawn - things are likely to speed up exceedingly! ideally, your pieces will then be like a torrent, forcing their way past the breach and into the unshielded enemy land beyond. if, as in the present game, you effect the breach and then your pieces have to maneurver and labour to trickle through one by one, you achieve far less of an effect.   white has the bishop pair, but as long as the position remains closed they are likely to be less effective than black's knights. in a situation where the position is opening up however, white should think carefully before giving up his bishops; they are likely to grow far more powerful shortly.  i believe black's move here to be a near-fatal mistake, allowing white to open up the position and get his pawns roling. better would be: 28...re8 29.fxe5 rxe5 30.rf1 rde7 31.d6 rd7 32.rd1 nh8 33.rd5 nf7. this is a mistake. white should - indeed, must! - advance his pawns immediately. the closer they get to the 8th rank, the more powerful they will be: once they get to the 6th rank they will severely restrict black's freedom of action, and on the 7th rank they will prove a massive problem for him. but as they are right now, they are more a nuisance than an actual threat, and this allows black the freedom to start actions against white's position. this should never have been allowed to happen. when you consider which move to make, it is a good rule of thumb always to make the one which poses the most problems for your opponent. in this case, the pawn advance: 30.e5 h4 31.f5 g3 32.bxg3 hxg3 33.rxg3  33.rc1? loses after 33...b3! however, the game move costs white an important pawn as well. gameknot recommends 33.rh1, but that loses too after 33...nxc4 34.re2 b3 35.rxh5 b2 36.rh1 rb8 37.rb1 rdb7 and 38...na3. black has now succeeded in creating passed pawns on both the kingside and on the queenside, while white's pawn majority in the center has yet to begin moving. strategically, the game is practically lost for white now.

tratto non riscontrato in altre partite; che sia una novità? si adotta subito la manovra per scardinare il centro del bianco. ancora un tratto inatteso che però non difende il centro il bianco tentava di giocare c6c7  con perdita della donna. e' necessario bloccare il pc6 e provvedere a breve a catturarlo. il nero non ha interesse ad aprire il centro, ha il pc6 facile preda e bb5 bloccato impedisce bb4 che avrebbe eliminato un difensore di bb5 non c'è tempo da perdere: il pc6 va eliminato soccorre bb5 e minaccia la cattura di nc6 prontamente difeso finalmente si libera la via per l'arrocco liberando di conseguenza nc6 dall'ichiodatura a questo punto della partita il bianco non trova di meglio che espandersi sul lato di re lasciando decidere al nero le sorti sul lato di donna. prima mossa di una manovra che mira a risolvere il blocco sul lato di donna con una serie di cambi. infatti se ora 19.dxe5 qxe3. ma lo scopo è quello di minacciare l'arrivo di nb2 con cattura della donna. ora il bianco deve abbandonare bb5 alla sua sorte se vuole conservare la donna. buona mossa per impedire il passaggio ne5d3b2 quindi si ripiega sull'attacco diretto di bb5 che non può essere difeso da rb1 per via di bf5. quindi bb5 non può né essere difeso né scappare. bene, cambiamo un po' di pezzi grave errore, il bianco non scorge la minaccia nb2 che gli farà perdere la donna. mi aspettavo 21.nxd3 bxd3  
-------------------------------------
i was betting than you would do 3...ng4 and after bb4 , qe7 and nc6 you would see all of the pressure against that bold e pawn and justify that gambit well i think this is an unnecesary move because you will go with ne6 anyway, then 5...d6 has more chances 'cus you open all of the lines to the bishops although i have said this move before, right now it´s better to continue with 7...nxb3 to make some queen deviation and avoid b4 from white to let 8...bc4 why not 9...qd6 ? at this time 13...qf6 would get some counter attack against d column well, white feels very trusted, but 16.h4 or 16.ne5 would be a devastating move to black obviously white knows the weak point first 17...qf6 more proactive 20...rf8 don't worry, there is not checkmat... yet. i think 21...c6 before because the move d5 is definitive well, he doesn't want 22.d5! and after 22...bb5, 23.rf4 and rb4 could control all of the black space well, although there is some playing with 25...re8, after 26.rxe8 rxe8, 27.d5 bb5 and 28.rxg5 there is no more game to the black pieces

well, i don´t know. sometimes it´s better a waiting until we have more pieces on the table. black would be confortable with a more desirable 6...e5 and if 7.d5 nc5 wouldmake some room to counter attack white´s structure off course you have to go with your plan, that´s the way there is a problem of perspective here, seems like we are eroding black´s structure, but at the same time we are opening some lines for the opponent, like the f column, to win the h column, but the clearvoyance would fail before making a clear advantage. when there is not a certain perspective sometimes we prefer moves like 8.h6 to stay straight the path of the plan and wait for a psicological result. i don´t say that 8.hxg6 it´s not a good move, in fact it´s a good one, but as i said is a perspective view. oh my gosh. changing plans in middle of the battle would be incongruent with the soul of chess, but with the human spirit. it seems like 9.d5 is a move with a few more chances, obviously you give the e5 point, but retain e6 and e7 and can try with f4, nh3 and qd3 to exploit the king side, and at last the f column is blocked before 0-0-0 off course! it doesn´t matter that there is a three pawn islands, but this position is more desirable to defend the e6 and e7 points what kind of openning is this one? there´s not an easy answer to this question, just one thing remains: one move can change our life... ... but i don´t think very good thinkings about this move. i would like 10...nc5 against e4 and try to make a free world to the beasts living in g7 and c8. at last the white can´t move the b pawn without hazardous results. what kind of competition we are seeing! it´s like you are saying: "no, i do the bad move-. no, i do the worst move-". for jesus! did not see that after 11...ne4 12.ne4 rf4 there is no a doubt about the more posible winner yesss! oh gosh! it´s like the football team against us failing a penalty! after this move white can reorder the pieces with ndb5 and be3 or bd2 to regain control looks very aggresive, but with 12...ne4 (again) there is an open f column and a weak g7-d4 diagonal to exploit well white, as chess player, you are a good poker player ;), because black did think that you had a joker underwear with c5. now, in this instance, recover power with 13.be3 and the queen has to fly quickly all right white i´m asking you: do you like that queen in c5? ufff! how it´s possible to lose here? not in this world! i will call this queen, the nomad queen. because 15.nf3 and 16.ng5 she is helping our best attack position well luke, all the planets are aligned, as your head astrologist i say you will destroy some castles. at this time the a2-g8 diagonal belongs to white hey luke, please don´t abandon your plan in the middle of the battle!! the best of the best of the best move is 17.c5! o even the magnificent 17.f4! and the nomad queen would go to 17...qa4, and after 18.c5! there is no time to cry for black. 17.nd5 is not bad, only close our beloved a2-g8 diagonal i like 18.rd5 because leave the hot move c5 alive, and remember the nomad queen has to walk. off course 18.cxd5 leaves open the c column to the remaining a8 tower yep, black has the right to give back one punch 20.nxh7! and keep the attack after this move i just only have to say thank you black! why are you so comprensive? i did wait for this moment since the beginning of the times! and the moment of glory comes when white play 21.rxg7! how many pieces are very important for black? how many are in good shape? just the nomad queen and the terrible beast in g7. then, at this moment i say: get out of here black bishop and thanks for the rook in f2 what´s up man? are you crazy? what kind of demons did you see? or it was just a moment of incredible weakness? off course 21...nc4 would be deffinitive noooo, fellow, you still had 22.rg7 to rescue some of the board i don´t know about your football club, but, well, it´s like to see manchester united losing against aston villa by 0-1 in the last minute, and the last words in our head is: "how i did not see?" 
-------------------------------------
i can not understand this move. looks aggressive but there is not enough pieces. i want the classic 3...a6 or 3...nf6 to open your game. anyway it´s style´s matter i dont know, but with 4...fxe4 you are in line with your plan well i think there is no reason to fear. 7...bxf5 and you have another piece to play well, he did not see 8.ne6 at first hey kain-, there is a god for you, obviously with 9.ne6 he is making a great investment, because he would gave back the gambit and after the attack to your pawn structure it would seems like a greek ruins oh the beatifull of chess, after this bad move (9.nh3?) you are with a little advantage. he has one bad knight, and you have two bishops in an open game.  at this time its difficult to exploit your pawn´s structure. anyway he has to play against your pawns and move 10.dxe4 kain- you have to accept that 10...exd3 is a better move because you are free of this weakness in e4, what is the head on this structure nooo! oh my god. that was the bad horse and you are eating bad quality meat. your better bishop were this one because your other bishop seems like a big pawn containing your pawns, and besides the white bishop is without space and you make it free. i like the more aggressive 12...bg4 i like 14...d4, retaining the d3 pawn and making space for nd4 sometimes believe in your attack, even better 16...g5 and if 17.bxc7 qxc7 18.fxg4 qb6  19.d4 qb2 20.ne2 bxg4 and you are confortable why not 18...nd7.  the white bishop seems like a big radar dont like 19...rb8 ? 20.re3! i dont know but i think he wants to take the e column with heavy metal better 25...g5 to go against the f column that was a definitive move because you have a bad bishop, your rooks are not playing in concert and he wants to get the e column well its not only the e column, but the c one and the g column you dont forget, you still have a queen, better 35...qd6 better 36.qc1, and if you play 36...kg5 37.nf7  rf7 38.re8  and lost the queen 
-------------------------------------
5.bc4? it´s better to get all the center with 5.c4 17.raxd1? (17.bxe6 ) 20.ng5? better: 20.nxg7 kxg7 and 21.rd7  define the game 23.rd7?? sometimes we have a bad day. obviously 23.bc4 again

echange de la paire de fous contre une meilleure activité des pièces blanches. avec les noirs je ne ferais pas cet échange. et vous ?
-------------------------------------
 commentaire de myself1234 : j'aurais joué e5 et laissé le cavalier la le temps qu'il faut.  ? je pensais que les noir auraient attaqués sur l'aile dame avec fd7. j'aurais attaqué sur l'aile roi avec dd2 préparant fh6
-------------------------------------
 commentaire de myself1234 : coup 9: bg4 ma semblé aussi suspect pour les noirs jaurais roqué avant et ensuite fd7, suivi de a6 et b5.
-------------------------------------
  les pièces noires ne sont pas suffisamment développées pour profiter du clouage du cavalier f3 le pion est empoisonné ! attention à la dame noire ! echange des dames et nous avons tour cavalier contre quatre pions
-------------------------------------
  pression sur la colonne c ?? 15. cxb3 la partie est gagnée pour les noirs c'est trop tard pour attaquer sur l'aile roi. l'avantage matériel noir est trop important. la position blanche n'est plus tenable et les erreurs se succèdent.

chads.>please  reply with improvments for the game .i love playing the french and hope to master it sometime.... thank you. the french winawer is an opening i began to play when i found a nice book in a bookshop for £2.00 ...one of only a few books i own and have read ferverously. from here it is up to white to choose , but carefully as each variation is unstable with no time to stumble ...  im not a good enough player yet to understand why there unstable but they are. the keres gambit 4.bd2...  most games i play are due to 4.e5 locking in the pawns but this variation allows black to snaffle some pawns while white gets stuck in on the king side. all known theory and quite relieving for me as most of my games encounter 4.e5 and the knight always seams awkward to me on e7 after whites kingside thrust. this has all known theory so far and the moves just come naturally. i have an extra pawn with my queen expecting a discovery by white at any time this position has been played before between boleslavsky and bronstien ,but we got here in a different move order , this bishop move back to f8 has a strong pyschological effect as it goes back to its origional square and puts the white queen in decision time. now here bd6 or rg4 have been played before in competition but i tryed something new. a new move i havent read about or seen before ... although blacks position seems to have a lot of holes the centre is quite active and peices can still develop to the protection of the king. c7 under some pressure and mostly the reason for moving c5. attack and defence. so the queen has c7 after all and can smell the king. just saving the bishop. oh dear an inevitable discovery with mate to follow ...... but my active centre should be sound. level material and white to play .... both of us have developed slowly and have awkward decisions to make.the two pawns look happy togeather in the centre and mostly my reason for this variation. i thought this move unfortunate for white ... i couldnt really see where he was going with it ......the bishop to b5 cant get took by the rook but  its too slow and it allows me to take command of the centre. the centre is mine . my attack plan was under way now .. i saw a possible check from the dark squared bishop , i had to get my rook activated , the lazy white squared bishop to move some how hello king........ hello queen.... attack and defence. now i wanted to activate my two queenside peices , i attempted to make white develop them for me. space at last space at last spoil sport out at last all out to play except poor old rook in the corner .... a complicated game for two amatuers im two pawns down now but have co-ordination and all my peices can wreak havoc    .........  i just liked this game not just becuase i won but i played a new variation of an opening i enjoy and sacrifised the queen for centre activity ..... its probably subject to ridicule by top players but i thoroughly enjoyed the game and i thank my opponent for that and frank marshell who first introduced the move 4.bd2  in 1901 against chigorin. 
-------------------------------------
i will annotate a newly played game of mine! sicilian defense. black is castling kingside. whites castling is delayed, at least three moves left. white is also castling kingside. ? maybe better for white to play on the queenside in this position? weakens the f-file. slow manouvering.  a little threat! doubling the rooks on the f-file. threatening the h3-pawn. white must prevent this! i had made kh2 instead. white can´t take this bishop, because it will opens up the g- and h-files in front of the black king. maybe it would be better to exchange queens and eliminate most of the pressure? slow maneuvering. a miss there of white. if white had played properly here in the endgame, i think it would probably end with a draw! 
-------------------------------------
dovde je sve knjiški, ništa novo ovaj potez gca ne prijavljuje kao grešku, ali to mi je bio prvi nerezonski, posle sam se o tog lovca samo saplitao... zapravo, ideja je bila da povežem bc2 i qd3, ali čak i da nije uveo konja u jednačinu, to bi trajalo tri poteza, a protivniku bi bilo dovoljno da odigra g6 - tad mi je to izgledalo izgledalo genijalno, ali posle se ispostavilo da je to totalno nerezonski plan, gubljenje tempa i pozicije, i poklanjanje vremena protivniku da lepo nagomila topove na c liniji... kad kola krenu nizbrdo... ovim b4 potezom sam praktično samog sebe pobedio, imao sam sreću što protivnik nije bio od onih koji to umeju da unovče ... još mi je pomogao da se više ne saplićem o lovca... dakle, zbog one gluposti s bd1 i b4 (iako protivnik nije unovčio odmah), nešto se grčim, ali polako gubim partiju, što je očigledno - gledam i razmišljam, baš mi je lepo kraljičino krilo, samo mi je kralj na potpuno pogrešnom kraju table, a top zarobljen, biće dovoljno da topa prebaci tamo i da mi sredi i a i b pijuna i mogu da se slikam, oslobodiće c pijuna (ovde sam iznenada postao pametan, pa sam sve jasno video za razliku od 17. i 18. poteza...)  gca je izračunao da sam ovde trenutno u minusu 2.16, i to čisto pozicionom, dakle pečen i poslužen...  onda mi protivnik, očigledno nezainteresovan za pijune na kontrakrilu, pakuje prvi poklon pa drugi poklon... i odmah mi nudi remi  iskreno, taj prvi put sam razmišljao da prihvatim, nikako da povuče taj bg5, ali možda se opseti. vidim da i dalje pozicija ne valja (gca je izračunao ovde -1.30), ali takođe vidim da uopšte ne zarezuje levo krilo, i da tu imam šansu, možda, ali ako prevedem kralja da može da dohvati njegovog c-pijuna i da ga blokira. tad smo još igrali obe partije pa sam rešio da malo rizikujem i odbijem remi. gca ovo prijavljuje kao grešku, verovatno i jeste, ali ovo je bio glavni deo mog plana: da eliminišem topove iz jednačine, nateram kraljicu da se zaleti na levo krilo, da mu dupliram i neutrališem pijune desno tako što ću dati konja za lovca i onda zapravo imam otvoren prostor da ja njega maltretiram kraljicom i, na kraju krajeva, izvučem bar remi večitim šahom... naravno, glavni cilj je da ga nateram na razmenu kraljica, jer sve vreme imam na umu dva pijuna sa dva polja razmaka između, koje posle kralj ne može da zaustavi krećem da prebacujem kralja protivnik se odmah navukao, izgleda kao da je zauzeo ekstra poziciju, pokriva c pešaka, ima na izvolte moja dva pijuna sledeći korak je izmenjati kraljice, i posle toga bih bio u problemu posle bg5, ali nosili bismo se već... međutim, on smatra da se to ne isplati, zašto bi pokvario c pijuna i moja dva koja već vidi pojedena... drugi deo plana, razmena uspešna gca ovde ne vidi ništa loše, ali po meni, mnogo jači potez je da potpuno ignoriše mog konja i odigra qxa3, ali suviše se komforno oseća da bi se uopšte uplašio ovog poteza, a zapravo time oslobađam f6 za damu sad sam ispunio sve što sam hteo. propustio je da uzme a3,  propustio je bg5, propustio je i da krene c linijom kad joj je bilo vreme. dosad je igrao opušteno dobijenu partiju, ali sad mu više nije svejedno, ako mu se uvalim kraljicom gore, ovako s kraljem levo, izgubiće partiju... i zato nema više c3, nema qxa3, mora pod hitno da vraća kraljicu meni sad razmena i te kako odgovara, posle razmene mi u bilo kojoj kombinaciji ostaju dva pešaka sa dva polja razmaka protiv kralja da li vidi ili ne vidi, ne znam, u svakom slučaju, ne sviđa mu se razmena (međutim, čvrst overujem da uopšte nije svestan zašto mu uporno poturam kraljicu pod nos) gca ovo ne smatra čak ni nepreciznošću (zato nikad ne verujem kompjuteru), a ovde je i konačno izgubio partiju dao mi je potez viška, sad ne može da mi da šah, i od sledećeg poteza može samo da igra kako ja sviram, a sve vreme na umu imam ona dva pešaka sa dva polja razmaka ne znam zašto je ovo odigrao, svakako ne bih menjao kraljice sad na f6, jer bih izgubio ključnog pešaka koristim poklonjen potez opet potpuno besmisleno, sa moje tačke gledišta... ako me posle qh5+... qxh6 pusti dole pojevši pijuna na b5, opet gubi ovde mi, inače, po drugi put nudi remi, što sad odbijam bez razmišljanja. i gca se konačno udostojio da mi da +0.74. uzimam poklon, što da ne, opet, ako uzme vrućeg b4 pijuna, izgubiće, toliko vidi i sam sve sam očekivao, ali ne i ovo. ne znam šta je hteo, valjda da skloni kralja s linije 7 e sad može razmena, jer dobijam dva pijuna sa tri prazna polja razmaka!!! tu i on vidi da neće moći da stigne oba, pa vraća kralja.  sad mi i treći put nudi remi, ali sad već mogu samo da se nasmejem. sve što sam isplanirao pre 20 poteza, sve sam ostvario glatko, i dobio partiju  (ovde sam već bio siguran da on uopšte ne uočava da ću posle razmena pešaka imati dva pešaka slobodna, koja on neće moći da uhvati) konačno se i cga otvorio da mi oda priznanje: +3.26 mistake: +4.22 » 53. kc3 kc7 54. e4 dxe4 55. kxc4 kc6 56. kc3 kb7 57. kd2 kc6 58. ke3 kb6 59. kxe4 kc6 60. h4 h6 61. h5 kc7 62. d5 exd5+ 63. kxd5 best: +6.33 » 53. b5 axb5 54. axb5 kc7 55. e4 kb6 56. exd5 kxb5 57. dxe6 kc6 58. kc3 kc7 59. kxc4 kd8 60. d5 h5 61. kc5 h4 62. kc6 ke8 63. kc7  eto, postojala je i prečica, a ja krenuo dužim putem. sve u svemu, šta god da sad odigram i kojim god redom da odigram, rezultat će biti isti, samo sam dodao malo poteza... ovo sam odigrao samo da bih mogao da kontrolišem njegove poteze kraljem posle ovog jedina figura kojom ima smisla da igra je kralj, tako da mi je lakše da ga namestim gde meni najviše odgovara blunder: +14.23 » … kd7 56. exd5 exd5 57. b5 axb5 58. axb5 kc7 59. e6 kd6 60. b6 kxe6 61. b7 kf5 62. b8=q kg4 63. qg8+ kxh4 64. qg6 kh3 65. qxh5+ kg3 best: +5.13 » … dxe4 56. kxc4 kb7 57. kc3 kc6 58. kd2 e3+ 59. kxe3 kb6 60. kd3 kc7 61. ke4 kd7 62. d5 exd5+ 63. kxd5 ke7 64. e6 kf6 65. kd6 kf5 blunder: +26.87 » … kc7 58. exd5 exd5 59. e6 kd6 60. b6 kxe6 61. b7 kf5 62. b8=q kg4 63. qg8+ kf3 64. qxd5+ kg4 65. qg5+ kh3 66. d5 kh2 67. d6 kh1 best: +13.24 » … dxe4 58. kxc4 kc8 59. d5 exd5+ 60. kd4 e3 61. kxe3 kc7 62. e6 d4+ 63. kxd4 kd6 64. b6 kxe6 65. b7 kf5 66. b8=q kg4 67. qg8+ kxh4  nikad nisam video ovoliki blunder :) on se u svakom slučaju ne predaje evo ih, preslikano kao iz udžbenika, dva pijuna sa dva prazna polja između u 6. redu - kralj ne može da ih uhvati na liniji šest (mogao bi na liniji pet, ali ovde više ne može) protivnik se konačno predao. dakle, partija je verovatno mnogima nezanimljiva, puna grešaka, ali ono što jeste zanimljivo je zapravo da je protivnik bio slep za šahovske osnove. jedini razlog zašto je izgubio, potpuno sam siguran u to, jeste zato što nije bio svestan da će mu ostati dva pešaka slobodnjaka u završnici pred golim kraljem, i da će to odlučiti partiju, dok sam ja imao za cilj baš to još od 34. poteza i bukvalno igrao (koliko sam umeo, vidim da se cga ne slaže sa mnom u mnogim potezima) na taj njegov slepi ugao (i što mi se ne dešava baš često, uspeo da sprovedem zamisao do kraja). zato i objavljujem ovu partiju, najviše za nas male igrače ispod 1700: uvek treba imati na umu gde će završiti pešaci u završnici, i svoji i tuđi, jer to na kraju odluči sve... 
-------------------------------------
white begins with the non-committal king's knight, controlling e5, but otherwise allowing black to occupy the center. most often (in my experience anyway) black will reply with 1…nf6 – a solid developing move waiting for white to show his hand first (and typically following a kid setup).  black however responds in classical fashion with the confident advance of the queen’s pawn to occupy the center thereby controlling e4 and freeing the queen’s bishop for development.   with the immediate advance of the c-pawn, white opens with the reti proper – threatening black’s d-pawn and offering the gambit to either displace black’s central pawn or cause him to lose time in defending it. the natural choice of the qga player, black removes the pawn to resolve the tension simply and immediately, giving up the center to achieve flexible play for his pieces. black’s main alternatives are 2…d4/e6/c6 which are all equally good.  white replies by the short advance of the king’s pawn, freeing the king’s bishop to attack c4. black chooses to develop the queen’s bishop to e6 to hold onto the pawn. normally, black would return the gambit pawn with normal development (e.g 3...nf6 4.bxc4 e6 5.d4 or even the questionable 3...b5 4.a4 c6 5.axb5 cxb5 6.b3!?)  nc3 seems to be the natural developing move if one were to ignore the pawn advantage and na3 is also certainly possible in attempt to recapture, but can white take advantage of the bishop which may be misplaced on e6, forcing it to move again while gaining a more threatening square?  black’s bishop sidesteps the knight while trying to hold the pawn and maintain a presence  through the center – however this allows white’s e-pawn to advance to e4 supported by ng5, pushing the bishop again, eventually allowing white to regain the pawn. the bishop retreats to the only square available, blocking the c-pawn. also possible was 5…e6,  attacking the advanced knight, 6.d4 bc6. white regains the pawn with an aggressively posted bishop pressuring the kingside, without a d-pawn to push it back.  in response, black looks to open a line for his bishop, blunt white’s bishop, and threaten the knight. 7.d3 seems to be the solid move to play to reinforce central occupation of e4 while defending ng5 with the queen’s bishop, but it results in a weak d-pawn. at this point i decided to move forward with the more dashing and perhaps questionable d4 for the large center effectively transitioning from what began as a flank opening to a more classic approach. in the event that black pushes queenside with b5, white now has extra options for redeploying the bishop. black develops his queen’s bishop to a great natural square, threatening ng5.  at this point i had a few different ideas. retreat with 8.nf3 bxe4 9.nc3. defend with the h-pawn? try to make something of a tactical shot with nxf7 then a queen check on h5? however, i decided upon the “throw all you got at the king and hope something sticks” approach with 8.f4 – defending our intrepid knight while gaining the broad center with nice open lines.   black develops the king’s knight to f6 trying to stake his claim into the center with both knight and bishop attacking the e-pawn.  again i debated with which approach i should take – should i play e5 and go with the slow but more solid approach or should i try to develop quickly and hope to overwhelm my opponent? i decided to move forward with nc3 – grasping more control over the center with a simple developing move. although the e-pawn is defended by both knights if one can be immediately displaced then the central pawn could fall. however, as we will see white has an interesting option available to create a strong imbalance while his pieces are mobile and his king relatively safe. instead of 9…h6 i believe black would have been safer with 9…o-o to be followed up with 10.e5 nd5 11.o-o.  to retreat with 10.nf3 would be to admit mistake and give up the pawn while losing time. 10.nxe6 gives up the knight to tear away at the pawns in front of black’s king while ramming the queen’s bishop deep into his territory – controlling key squares around the king and cutting off castling avenues. at the same time, the e4 pawn is no longer free for the taking… black blunders by accepting the pawn and mate is forced - 12.qh5+ g6 13.qxg6+ kf8 14.qf7#.  (11.bxe4 12.nxe4 also looks weak for black even if not immediately losing the game). stronger would have been either 11…bd7 or 11…nbd7 to develop the queen’s pieces while still keeping control of h5. although black would have been up a knight for two pawns, white still would have retained a strong initiative with mobility, space, and control with a complex and interesting game ahead.

igra četiri skakača. volim ovu poziciju jer znam šta sledi. beogradski gambit je moja opsesija još iz mladih dana i nikad ne propuštam da ga odigram. to je varijanta koju sam najviše studirao i u njoj za mene nema nepoznanica sve do završnice. ako protivnik zagrize mamac, biće samleven. taj gambit ima svojih slabosti, ali protivnik mora da odigra do savršenstva precizno da bi ih iskoristio. to se dešava izuzetno retko jer je malo onih koji poznaju ovu varijantu.  ovo je još uvek igra četiri skakača. nastavak za belog u toj varijanti je : nxe4, ali ja to nikada ne igram. beogradski gambit !! najbolji nastavak za crnog je  5...be7 6. bc4 d6 7. nxd4 o-o 8. o-o ovakav razvoj belom ne daje prednost u otvaranju kao neka druge varijante i zbog toga beogradski gambit nije popularno otvaranje, ali ja ga volim zbog onoga što sledi, ako crni ne odigra tako. ovo otvaranje  protivniku koji ga ne poznaje deluje prilično laički. krši pravilo otvaranja: -ne igrati istom figurom dva puta u otvaranju, ostavlja nebranjenog pešaka koji uopšte ne deluje otrovno i ... teško je odoleti.  upravo tako !  crni je zagrizao prvi mamac i pojeo tog pešaka koji je otrovan samo ako crni nasedne i drugi put na nešto još privlačnije. ovo je crni predvideo i zna kako da se brani. verovatno se i pomalo smeška. to uopšte ne deluje opasno, a beli se još više zapetljava. sada već ima dva pešaka manje i zatvorenog belog lovca. ono čega crni, u ovom trenutku nije svestan je da je ovo, zapravo jedini mogući potez i da on polako upada u mašinu koja će ga samleti, ako bude neoprezan. ovo je zaista najbolji potez crnog. svaki drugi potez prepušta belom inicijativu. ovaj potez će odigrati svaki majstor i može se naći u svim bazama podataka.  crni sada igra potpuno školski i potpuno je ubeđen da je na pravom putu. ustvari...on to i jeste. njegova pozicija je bolja, inicijativa je njegova, ali ... ima tu još nekih izazova koji ga čekaju.  mislim da je crni ovde očekivao -qxd3 jer ovo ne izgleda baš dobro za belog. naravno !  bela dama više ne može da vezuje crnog konja. mora da se sklanja sa e linije i gubi konja g5. pozicija belog zaista izgleda očajno. qe3 gubi damu.  qd1 gubi konja. sve drugo osim qd1 gubi topa.  9. qh5+ g6 bi sve to odložilo samo za jedan potez.  crni ima mnogo razloga da se oseća superiorno u ovoj poziciji i da se opusti. iz njegovog ugla, ova partija je praktično dobijena. beli je ipak odigrao qh5+.  iz ugla gledanja crnog to je samo očajnički potez i odugovlačenje. iz ugla belog to je rutinska igra i uvlačenje crnog u zamku iz koje nema vađenja. zanimljiva pozicija i crni mora malo da se zamisli.  mislio je da je odvezao napadnutog crnog konja, ali on je i dalje vezan jer iza njega se nalazi nebranjena figura.  nc2+ i uzimanje topa izgleda privlačno, ali ako se malo bolje analizira, beli jednog konja uzima, a drugi ostaje zarobljen i to nije dobra trampa. osim toga beli bi potpuno pruzeo inicijativu i sa pet aktivnih figura lako savladao crnog.  sve je lepo odigrao, ali topa još ne sme da uzme i to je pomalo iritirajuće. i to je upravo ono što će crnog kasnije uvesti u zamku. ta fiksacija poteza nc2+ koja dugo traje i sve vreme mami i opija crnog.  to je u ovoj varijanti najveći adut belog i to je upravo ono zbog čega sam zavoleo beogradski gambit.   crni i dalje pokazuje zavidno poznavanje teorije ili je ovu poziciju veoma detaljno i dugo analizirao. ovo je zaista najbolji potez crnog. kocka je bačena ! ovo je trenutak partije u kojem sam uvek uzbuđen.     najbolji potez za crnog je bg7 !! ako odigra to onda zadržava prednost i materijalnu i pozicionu i beli će morati veoma preciznom igrom da se bori za remi. dobar potez je i qa5+, ali i on vodi u remi, ako beli odigra precizno.     najgori potez za crnog je nc2+, ali i najprivlačniji. ( :  osim toga, crni je veoma dugo fiksirao taj potez i imao ga na oku i zbog toga se najveći broj igrača ovde prevari.  onaj e4 pešak u petom potezu nije bio toliko otrovan i mogao se svariti, ali on je vodio crnog do ove pozicije, a top je smrtno otrovan. naravno, nije to lako da se vidi jer ništa u ovoj poziciji ne ukazuje na to. crni je zagrizao mamac. ( :  ovaj potez kralja, iako iznuđen, ima dve napadačke funkcije. tera crnog konja dalje u zamku i istovremeno oslobađa polje e1 za topa.  sad je crni već potpuno izgubljen, ali verovatno još uvek nije svestan toga. ovo je za mene jako zanimljiv potez. u teoriji i u svim partijama majstora koje sam pronašao(a nema ih mnogo) ovde beli uvek i bez izuzetka igra 15. d6! zbog toga ja ovaj potez bb5 smatram svojim potezom. ( :   verovatno nisam pogledao dovoljno partija, ali nema veze. neću ni da gledam. lepše je ovako. to ću smatrati svojim potezom sve dok mi neko ne pokaže partiju u kojoj je to neko odigrao na zvaničnom turniru, a da je tražim sam...neću. ( : 15. d6 je dobar potez i vodi u pobedu, ali mene je toliko iritirao zbog sporosti da ga nikad nisam do kraja analizirao.  možda je on i bolji, ali ja potezu bb5 ne mogu da nađem ni jednu jedinu manu. mnogo je lakši za analiziranje jer je brz. odmah otvara sve karte i ne ostavlja crnom ni tračak nade. za mene je ovde partija završena. crni ne može da učini apsolutno ništa da se izvuče. jedino logično. pretnja na c2, ali ....nema crni vremena. ovaj potez crnom definitivno izbija poslednji adut i nadu da može da se izvuče. konj ostaje zarobljen, d6 i dalje preti, pa i žrtva topa je opcija. praktično, sve figure belog su potpuno operativne i imaju igru. crni nema odgovor na tolike pretnje. ovo je iz očaja. pokušaj da se neočekivanim potezom nešto promeni na tabli. ali ne smeta ništa. sve je isto, samo njega nema. (: ovaj potez sprečava i napredovanje d pešaka i žrtvu topa. alternativa je qb6, ali u tom slučaju, žrtvom topa beli može da diriguje sve do mata. kraj !  ovo dalje je samo rutinska završnica i može da ide u raznim pravcima, ali ishod ne dolazi u pitanje.  
-------------------------------------
the most agressive line in the scandinavian. it may be that this line should be considered ´incorrect´, but at my level, i am unlikely to encounter opponents that can actually prove this and there are seceral lines that can lead to very agressive and tactically interesting games. icelandic variation. at this point, it is unlikely that black will regain his pawn soon, but the head start in development often leads to quick control over the central files, so that white will have to deal with a lot of pressure. maybe not the best. the idea of course is to set up the discovered check by taking the c-pawn, but white now gets the chance to build up a solid defense by blocking the e-file with be3, leaving little play for black in exchange for the sacrifice pawn. a more agressive option would have been 6.... ne4 not the best defense. while it blocks the discovered check, black can still take on c4, because the bishop that was defending it is now pinned. a balancing factor to all this is that taking on c4 merely equalizes material and that white will regain his slight advantage in the development because black needs to make so many moves with his bishop. however, the c-pawn is also rather important, because once it is gone, the d-pawn can no longer count on support from fellow pawns and will therefore likely become a prey for black in the future. the exchange allowed white to develop quickly. a better idea may have been bd5, as the most likely line that would follow is development of the knight towards f3 (either directly or through exchange of the bishop on f3), which would leave the knight on c3 weaker and more susceptible to moves like ne4 in hindsight this is a rather weird move. of course, i pressure e3, but qd3 is an excellent defense, and that's most likely where white would want to place it anyway. simply furthering development, through nc6 and then castling on either side would have been more solid. immediately posts the rook where it needs to be and the asymmetric castling makes it all the more likely that the game will become dynamic and interesting. trying to put pressure on the freshly created weakness in the king's position. but it is quickly blocked by white preparing g5 i could not resist the promiss of winning a pawn, but perhaps it would have been better to continue the project of opening the h-file via 15...g5 thoughtless. there wasn't really a good reason to give up a pawn at this point. g5 to poke away the knight before the moving the rook on h8 would probably have been better. if black would trade rooks at d7, he would momentarily gain control over the d-file, which benefits him to some extent, but this close to the endgame, the extra pawn is probavly worth fighting for. once again, an attempt to save the pawn through 21... g6 22. nf4 nce5 could well be better, although in this case, white could follow that up with forcing the rook trade, leaving  a rather equal knight end game regardless. f3 is actually rather weakening, since i threaten to set up an attack and 24. f4 leads to ng4, blocking the march of the white passed pawns. 25, nxf6 was not allowed, because of 25...nxf3 26. rxf3 (kh1 rh2#) nxf3  in hindsight i don't really like this move. i considered i might be able to block the white's pawns with my knights, so i wanted to create three connected passed pawns to force the issue. however, as we will see later, white's rook becomes an important tool to cut off my king from the king side. therefore, 26...rxf2 27.kxf2 f5 followed with rushing my king to the king side to catch white's passed pawn was likely better. excellent move by white that i had overlooked. the trade is forced and immediately places the white rook firmly on the d-file, cutting my king off from any potential interference with his h-pawn. on its way to e5 from where it will have access to both g6 and f7 for control over h8 chosen over g6 as it would be more easily protected by the king here (e.g. 31. rf2 kd7 32. rxf6 ke7), but g6 would have been a foil to white's following move (to some extent at least) it is a necessity to create some breating space for the king, since white threatens to push the king with ne7. while white cannot checkmate at d8 because of the knight on f7, black would still rather not be forced to place his king on b8, as it would allow for overloading the defensive responsibilities of the knight, threatening both rd8 and h8q as previously stated, the knight has too many defensive responsibilities at this point, so it can't afford to take the rook. white's approach here is quite interesting. of course he is piling on the pressure right now, but he also moves his rook away from the second row, where it was crucially protecting his king. as we will see, this seals the fate of the game. another option white had was to keep his rook as a defense to his king and play ng6. this would allow him to trade his h-pawn for the black knight. at that point the game would become a race between the three connected passed pawns for black and the single passed pawn (black's f-pawn is likely not going to hold out much longer after the knight is taken) that is supported by an additional piece. i have not looked into this end game very thoroughly, so i can't really say if rd8 would be a mistake, as it throws away a won endgame, or rather a great way to force the draw, but it is certainly interesting to play out the more daring option of 34. ng6 a few times as an end game training. a draw is agreed as repetition of moves is now unavoidable. the white king needs to make sure he prevents the black rook from taking control over the h-file, since that would cost him his most important pawn. at the same time, black needs to keep 'trying' to do just that, as he would otherwise allow white to play rf8, winning the knight. overall the game seemed like a bit of a back and forth between two parties that both obtained small advantages during it, but could never properly capitalize on these advantages and ultimately both ended up conceding them to the other player. at least studying the game revealed some subtleties that might be learned from in order to be able to turn small advantages into a win next time. 
-------------------------------------
not c3, as i tried in another annotated game of mine. although i won that game, its opening phase seemed questionable on my part, so i decided to go more conventional in this case.  preparing bg7 leading to a rather strong bishop for black pressuring the knight, but in hindsight this is really too optimistic, or at least too early: as we will see in a moment, the queen will be hurled around a bit, while black positions his pieces nicely. simply developing the knight seems better. profilaxis against ne5. it doesn't prevent the move, but it does prevent it from being an annoying fork. i wanted to develop my other knight via d2, so i avoided qd2 here, but as we will see later, this is not really the most convenient square either, since black will be able to place a knight on g4 with a tempo gain later on. as mentioned earlier, the ill-positioned queen allows black to make this move à tempo and it leads to a powerful sequence winning a pawn 14. h3 doesn't seem great either because of 14...qxd4 15. xg4 qxb2 16. nd2 nf6 black doesn't mess about with his queen out in the open, but retreats to set up his pieces for what should be a favourable end game, as he is a pawn up and white's pawn structure on the queen side is messed up normally one might indeed want his rooks on the centre files, but in this case, the rook was probably better positioned on b1, where it gets to put on some (momentary) pressure. black's favourite move to develop his bishop (seen next move) would for example not be possible in that case unnecessary. g4 might be an interesting move to play somewhere in the future, but since the bishops are likely to trade anyways, preparing it in this manner doesn't do much but waste time. black trades off to take away tension from the board and make transition to a won end game more comfortable, but it comes with the down side of fixing white's pawn structure. opening up the centre would be favourable as i have already positioned my rooks along the centre files. looking to trap the knight, but really losing another pawn, since black can punch right back with his own little trick given that black will win back a knight with e4 on his move, playing nxe4 first is better. this still loses a pawn through 23...bxe4 24. xh5 xh5, but at least in that position, black has a bunch of weak pawns, rather than a pawns on f3, preventing my king to move out in the end game. preparing for an exchange sequence and we've entered the end game. white seems heavily disadvantaged, but it didn't look much better before the exchange if for example qd2 would have been played, rather than qe2 seems a bit inaccurate in hindsight. if i allow black to take, his pawn structure is ruined, so i am likely to get the pawn back anyways and in this way, i allow black to create a fast lane for his king. opens up a quick route for the king to rush forward. trying to secure the h2-g3 route for the king but effectively prevents that be3 was coming, so this move is useful to make sure that black is not obligated to trade in that position (which would free the white king and doom the f3 pawn). avoiding the trade to keep the king locked up i planned on getting my king to e3 and wanted to block his qs movement in the meantime. however, this wasted one tempo too many, as black's king will join the action too quickly now. with the black king this far advanced and two pawns down, there really is no hope any more, since the pawns on the king side should easily overwhelm me. i rather pointlessly played some more moves. and a concession. black can free up his h-pawn, then block the b8-h2 diagonal with a bishop on e5 and happily march to h1.

i had just turned 16, and was starting to become aware of the joys of the fairer sex. i was also obsessed with chess. one night, i went to sleep after studying some games in bobby fischer’s “60 memorable games.”
-------------------------------------
 i woke up to find myself lying in soft grass. looking up i saw that i was in a square field. beside me was a bench, with, what seemed to me at the time, an old man crying. i noticed the long robe, and the mitre on his head, and his long staff. “he must be a bishop” i said to myself. i sat down beside him and asked me what was the matter. as he removed his hands from his face, i noticed for the first time that he was black, and i saw the purple shirt he was wearing, with a dog collar above it, as confirmation that he was indeed a bishop.
-------------------------------------
 “it’s starting again. the kings and queens are collecting armies together. there is going to be another war. beware young man, beware.”
-------------------------------------
 just then a black horse slowly trotted up beside us. a tall, dark lady was riding side-saddle on it. she was wearing a long flowing cloak and a small crown on her head. i realised she must be a queen. she slipped off the horse and clicked her fingers in front of the bishop with the single word “sleep”. the bishop immediately seemed to fall into a deep sleep. “what’s up with him” i thought to myself, for at that time, i had no knowledge of the art of hypnotism.
-------------------------------------
 “what have we here? is it a boy who will fight for me?”
-------------------------------------
 “i’m not going to fight for you. i don’t want to die. i am white, if i fought for anyone it would be for the white queen.”
-------------------------------------
 “but black can become white and white can become black. haven’t you heard of michael jackson?”
-------------------------------------
 “yes but i don’t want to end up like him.”
-------------------------------------
 “good point and you will not.”
-------------------------------------
 “and you are in your pyjamas; boys in their pyjamas should be asleep.”
-------------------------------------
 “look into my eyes boy.”
-------------------------------------
 “yes i can see in your eyes that you have been sleeping, and that you want to go back to sleep. let me help you boy. just look into my eyes and trust in me. trust in me completely.”
-------------------------------------
 i didn’t trust her one inch, but somehow i couldn’t turn my gaze away, i wanted to keep looking into those eyes.
-------------------------------------
 “that’s right boy keep looking into my eyes and listening to my voice, my sweet soothing voice.”
-------------------------------------
 “sleep boy and dream of me. i am your queen. you love me boy. you love my big brown eyes. keep thinking of my eyes. you love the smell of my perfume. you love my voice. you love my touch. you are next thing i knew there was noise and commotion everywhere. i was standing in front of her.
-------------------------------------
 “be ready boy, we are about to start.”
-------------------------------------
 “pawn to queen four” bellowed a voice behind and to left of me.
-------------------------------------
 “oh darling you are so old-fashioned.” i heard my queen behind me. “he means pawn to d5. that’s you boy, off you go, forward two squares.”
-------------------------------------
 she pushed me in the back and thrust me forward two squares. i came face to face with the opposition soldier. “i have no quarrel with you” he said.
-------------------------------------
 “but i have!”
-------------------------------------
 “look out, use your shield,” shouted my queen from behind me.
-------------------------------------
  “don’t worry we will send re-enforcements.” my queen shouted from behind me.
-------------------------------------
 “can i suggest the slav defence dear?”
-------------------------------------
 “yes pawn to queen bishop’s three.”
-------------------------------------
 “he means pawn c6.”
-------------------------------------
 “don’t worry sir; i am here to protect you.”

called the "grivas" sicilian in the name of greek gm grivas who used to play it a lot. all this suite is theoric till the 15th move .. the only game i found in my database, played by gm. grivas (2505) with black against zoltar almasi (2610) in kopavogur (island) 1994 (1/2-1/2). here almasi played bxc3. this move is right too.  all the following moves are analyzed with fritz 8   best move for fritz fritz proposes nc1 fritz proposes qb8 and gives "=" for the position best move for fritz best move for fritz best move for fritz white knight found a good position, and at this time i thought that black position was a little under. that is not true, as fritz propose now ba6 with a draw position.  this thematic move is also playable, and this is the second best move for fritz best move for fritz bad move !!! deteriorating the pawn structure, giving access to black squares,  fritz gives  = for white ( 0.78) with f4-f5 following for white   ba6 was much better best move for fritz 2nd best move for fritz that recommands e5 black stay with a bad evaluation (-1.00) best move for fritz a difficult move to find, but the best for fritz ! it protects e6, to avoid ke6 best move for fritz a good move that maintain the pressure.  best move for fritz keep a pressure on g2.   fritz proposed bh6 with  1.16.  here the position is nearly draw now black have not a lot of moves, but ke4 is to be studied with attention best move for fritz it was a little breath for black at now, i can say that white have done a good work, except their last move, and fritz evaluates the position with an advance of half a pawn for white.  black have well played also, except g6, that was a big mistake. fritz proposed bxe7 ( 0.47)  white move is drawing   fritz was recommanding bf6  now he gives the following suite for white  1. � (0.78): 25. te1xe4 fd5xe4 26.f5-f6 fe7xf6 27.tf1xf6 db7-d5 28.dh3-c3 fe4xg2  29.rh1-g1 dd5-e5   well, that was a breath again for black the best move for fritz  now fritz recommands to let the knight here and proposes rdb8   fritz gives a draw evaluation a little  = for white ( 0.44)  white missed the following suite 1.  - (1.59): 13.dh3-c3 f7-f6 14.fb5-c6 fd5xc6 15.cd4xc6 td8-d7 16.cc6xe7  td7xe7 17.te1xe7 db7xe7 18.tf4xf6 rg8-h7 19.fh6-g5  i was waiting for this move ! for the first time, the evaluation is better for black, (-0.91), despite the white supremacy ! fritz gives bf6, i saw it but the position was really too complex a simple move, but totally wrong ! fritz gives ba6, with  1,75 for white , and my opponent and me did not see it. difficult to find it in a such complicated position at this time i saw a very good move for black. fritz gives  1.75 for black in this suite ! i was lucky incredible ! queen e7 is not takeable, (rc1 mates). g2 and re1 are attacked, there is no defense that doesn't loose material a big blunder but the match was so difficult ! i proposed draw, and my russian opponent accepted. the same day, russia was eliminated from european football cup against spain 3-0. anyway it was a great  team !! thanks to my opponent, krotenok, and nice to meat you !  a very tactical match, with a lot of opportunities.

the first move, which is used to try and make the player take it. someone else sees an unprotected pawn, so goes for it. someone lets greedy someone else have the pawn. greedy someone else takes the pawn. now, if greedy someone else is feeling really greedy, he will capture the pawn and lose his own pawn and a rook. someone else is really greedy today! now someone gets the pawn, and in the next move a rook. someone else gasps and tries to block in the bishop… …who takes someone else's rook. someone else is going to try to get the bishop now. threatens bishop in order to open up the queen and bishop. someone else retreats one square. only to be threatened again. he retreats one square again. pushes up queen to play e3, opening up the bishop. greedy someone else threatens the bishop, who is trapped. the trapped bishop receives a pawn. and is taken by the queen. developing. someone else develops as well. opens up the bishop. someone else accepts the swap. and someone takes back. someone else moves back to maybe double up the diagonal with queen. someone develops his other knight. someone else wants to swap queens, as someone's queen is stopping someone else's king to a safe position. but someone doesn't want to swap queens… …and as stupid as his move is, someone else doesn't want to swap knights. and he doesn't have to, he'll lose a queen instead. at this point, someone else resigned. 
-------------------------------------
white has the initiative, and plans 15. d4. black can not wait quietly, and must do something. 15...f5? is weak do to 16 f4, with clear advantage to white. 15.... d5 was possible, and maybe was better than the actual move of the game.  a mistake! i didn´t see white´s  strong reply. but it is not so easy to see in this position that when the pawn on d6 moves, the diagonal c5--f8 lies open to the very strong white bishop, pinning the night e7 on the rook f8.  the reason for this move is to leave d8 free for the c6 knight. i expected    16 d5 ke8 with a good game for black!   very strong!  only move! if 17......f5 18 qb3  kh8 19 exf5 rxf5 20 rfd1 qf7 rd6! with overwhelming  position for white the best. if 18 rc1 be6  greatly reduces white advantage   only move  again the best. i see no other options, black must exchange some pieces to relief it´s squashed position. again the best! bold and strong. if 20 nxd5? be6 gives black a good game  possibly this was a bad move. the position is very complex. probably 20...ne7 was better, but i am not still sure. again the best! very strong and bold.  if 21 qe2, either 21....f5 or (probably better) 21...bd7 give black a good game .  white stands better. now black´s best hope is to play at some point, n.... f5; n1....e4, give life to the g7 bishop, exchange pieces, and exploit the d6 pawn, that is likely to become a weakness, when there are few pieces on the board.   nevertheless, 21... f5 immediately is too dangerous. e.g. 21....f5 22. nd5 threatening both 23 nc7  followed by 24 bd5 (winning at least the exchange) and 23 ne7   followed 24 ba7, again winning the exchange, this time capturing the other rook. if 22 ....e4? 23 ne7  and 24 f3, with great advantage to white. if 22 ....qd7 23 ra1 followed by 24 ra7, and white´s initiative is difficult to stop. i couldn´t find a saving move for black.   on the other hand, 21 ....nb7 was possible and maybe better than the game´s move. could follow 22 ra1 f5 23 bb6 e4 25 bxb8 bxa1 26 qxa1 be6.  a mistake (white's first, in my rumble understanding). 22 kd5 was very strong, and would keep black in a very difficult position. black can play neither 22 ....nc6? because of 23. nc7 followed by 24. bd5 winning; nor 22....be6 because of 23. ne7  followed by 24. ba7, also winning. the best hope would be 22....ne6, and white could keep the pressure e.g. with 23 ra1. the miserable black’s b8 rook is threatened by all sides, and can´t find a good position. with the games move, black begins to see light in the end of the tunnel only move. 22.... ne6? is answered by 23 qb3, with a clear advantage for white. the best. 23 f4 would be answered by 23......f5, threatening 24.....e4. so 24 fxe5 bxe5. and now either 25 qb3 or 25 re1 are answered by 25.....bxc3, eliminating the dangerous knight, and leaving black with the better position, due to the d6 pawn, that will gradually become a weakness.   the game’s move increases the pressure on the d file and the b5 pawn.  now that black could breath, it is time to star the plan n....f5; and when possible, n2.....e4 another imprecision. the only way to avoid the freeing move 24.....e4, was 24 rfe1!, with a complex game. white would threaten to gain the a file, which, combined with the strong activity of the minor pieces would win the b5 pawn or one exchange, and win the game. black would have to answer 24......bxd5 25 nxd5. and now black has two possibilities, the less risky 25....rfb7, defending b5 and contra balancing white future activity on  the a file. and 25.....ne6, with an unclear game.  finally! the idea now is to eliminate the dangerous nc3, which is central to white´s possibilities to create threatens with the d6 pan. without the white knight on board, the pawn starts already to become week. to me this looks a good move! but detoxer said he is not sure about it, he maybe prefers 26. rxc3 instead. i would have answered to 26 rxc3 with 26......bxd5, and i think the white rook is not well placed on d5. e.g. 27.... nc6 28 rd1 ne5 with an about equal game. also possible is 26....qxe6 27 rxc3 rd7 28 f3 nf7 29 fxe4 ng5 and now if 30 e5 ne4 with an equal game. the knight starts an epic journey to d3. if it gets there safely, black will have the better game. so white must play 28 kh1! avoiding  28.....nf3? due to the decisive 29. qa2! threatening both a)  the maneuver 30.ra3 and 31. rb7 or (if the black rook leaves b8,) 31 rb8  ; and b) 30 qd5. black has no way to defend the position. e.g. 29 .....qd7 30. ra3 rb7 31 ra8  kg7 32 qb2  rf6 33 be3 threatening 34 rf8 kxf8 35 qxf6  kg8 ra1 and winning. or  29....ne5. 30 qd5 rd8 31 ra3 nc4 32 ra7 winning (32....kg2 33. d7)  in face of all that, after 28 kh1! black would play 28....rd7, with an unclear game.  a mistake, see comment to black's 27th move. now the knight will reach a very strong position, and give black the upper hand. also possible was 30 qa2 nc4 31. ra6 rd7 with slight advantage for black.  the b pawn still has to be defended, and that shows the strength of the white´s 23th move (qe2).  now other moves for black would be bad. e.g.  31.....rd8? 32 bb6 or 31..... rc8? 32 rd5.  it is not clear to me if this move is bad.  detoxer also is not so sure about it, and told me that considers maybe qe3 better. but nothing is so clear since the black position is already slightly better, and the game’s move kept white with drawing chances.  detoxer takes 32 qe3 into consideration, but black could have followed 32....qc6 33 bc5 rd7! and now if 34 qd4 e3 , with clear advantage for black.  maybe 32 ra1 qc6 33. bc5 nc4 was better, but black still has slight advantage.   only move, but strong. any exchange of queens here (on f7 or a2) is hopeless for white. obviously, to exchange the knight for the bishop would be a blunder. it is the lack of ability of the bishop to help the d6 pawn to advance that makes that pawn weak. if the small pieces disappear from the board, all of the sudden the pawn gets renewed strength, and that combined with the exposed black king’s position would leave white with the better game. besides that, black must be very careful, because the weakness on the dark squares, specially the a1-h8 diagonal, combined with the weakness of the 8 line, can generate mating possibilities for white. e.g. 33.....nc4 34 bc5 qe8 (to defend the 8 line) 35 qd4 rd7, but now 36 qd5  (threatening ra1) qf7 (only move) and now white is clearly better, and can play either 37 qa8 or 37 qc6.  necessary, to defend the 8 file.  otherwise, 35.....qd5 with clear advantage. white can not take on c4, because it leads to a lost ending, as in the game. but 36.qe3 was a very interesting option, with the plan to play for draw, and very strong chances of getting it, for with the rook on d7 (defending f2) and the queen on e3 defending c5, it is not easy to see a breakthrough for black. here there is a very subtle detail. black could have played 36.....qd5, and after the forced 37.kg1 (otherwise black wins immediately ) 37....qf7. but that would have been a mistake, because it would have strengthened white’s position. the present position of the white king on h1, and the debility of the f2 pawn can be exploited not only by the queen, but also by the knight. so it was very important to leave the w. king there, as will be seen in the game on white’s 40th move.  again, white can not exchange queens, for the ending is strongly favorable to black. after an almost lost position on move 21, black could be tempted to go for the draw with 37.....qc4. we are lucky when we can see the changes in the balance of the game, for it is so easy to stay with some strong situation (as whites advantage on move 21) frozen in the mind. (especially in real time, on the board, games). but now it is black who has the upper hand.    this gives white a drawing possibility, but i could not find anything better. the position is a lot trickier than it looks at first glance. e.g. 38...qb3 is dangerous. 39 kh2! and now black has no way to continue with the initiative:  39.....dxd1?? looses to 40 qd5  39.....ra2?? looses to 40 d7 39.....rf1?? looses to 40 d7 so black would have to play 39....qc4, with a worsened position (for the white king is better at h2.  i didn't understand why my strong opponent took the queen, entering a clear lost ending. after 39. qf6 the position is still extremely complex: if black tries to force the win with 39....qb3???, he looses to 40 rxd3! followed by bd4 and mate.   if 39....qd5?? 40 bd4 threatening mate and winning., the only possible try would be the risky and cloudy move 39....nxc5 40 bxc5 qb3 with a complex position. with the game's move, white is clearly lost.  i congratulate my opponent, detoxer, for a very fine game. the most interesting i have played in gameknot so far. i was first lucky to escape a miserable defeat on the early middle game, then still luckier to win, but will take more care on such symmetric positions on the future. 
-------------------------------------
this game is the main claim to fame of both hamppe and meitner, and has been reprinted widely. the variation of the vienna game it uses was named the hamppe–meitner variation in honour of the two players. the game was played in the 19th-century romantic style, in which rapid development and attack were considered the most effective way to win, where many gambits and counter-gambits were offered (and not accepting them was considered slightly ungentlemanly), and where material was often held in contempt. these games, with their rapid attacks and counterattacks, are often entertaining to review even if some of the moves would no longer be considered the best by today's standards. in the game, black sacrifices huge amounts of material to drive the white king to his back rank and attempt to force checkmate, but white spectacularly manages to force a draw by perpetual check. so the game start conventionally enough. this is the vienna game, an opening which hamppe made major contributions to, giving his name to two variations in the vienna gambit. 2...nf6 is more usual. this move is offbeat, but certainly playable. better would be 3.nf3! d6 4.d4 and white has a slight advantage. the move is premature; although many lines of the vienna have white trying to obtain the bishop pair with this move, the bishop can still retreat to e7, and the knight is not ideally placed at a4. the quiet 3...be7 would be better and less risky, especially since the move played may in fact lead to a win for white with best play. a bishop sacrifice is commonly seen in reply to an early knight attack in various lines, including this one. of course white does not want to be materially down. black attacks, and forks king and e4 pawn. the only way to save the e4 pawn. if 5. kf3 then qf4 drives the king away from the protection of the e4 pawn. black checks again. white obviously doesn't want to lose the e4 pawn. black tries to open up the position, in order to get at the wandering white king. although 7.qe1 is usually given as a refutation of this line, with 7...dxe4+? 8.kc3 e3?! 9.kb3! be6+ 10.ka3 where black has nothing left, black need not play 7...dxe4+?, and in fact better is 7...nf6! (schiller's move) 8.g3! dxe4+ 9.kc3 qg4 10.bh3 nd5+ 11.kb3 nc6!! (11...qg6!? is unclear) 12.bxg4! na5+ 13.ka3 nc4+ 14.kb3 na5+ with an equal position. 7. kc3 is perhaps the best move. threatening the na4 better for white than this curious king move would be 8.d4!? exd4+ 9.qxd4!! qe1+ 10.bd2! qxa1 11.nf3 qxa2 (an alternative is 11...nc6!? 12.qxg7 be6 13.nc5! 0-0-0 14.nxe6 fxe6 15.qxh8 qxa2 16.bg5 where white has a large advantage) 12.qxg7 qxa4 13.qxh8 d4+ 14.nxd4 qa5+ 15.kb3 qxd2 16.qxg8+ ke7 17.qxc8 qxd4 18.bc4! and white has a winning advantage, but must find several very difficult moves. threatening 9...qb4#. this move is a crucial mistake, after which black forces the draw in a breathtaking manner. white can win here more easily than at the previous move with 9.d4! exd4 10.bxa6 bxa6 11.nc5 or 9.c3! bd7 10.ka3 b5 11.d4 bxa4 12.bxa6 qxg2 13.qf3! qg6 14.qxd5 bc6 15.bb5. a spectacular queen sacrifice, preventing white from playing nc3 and ka2, after which black has insufficient compensation for his material disadvantage. the move forces the draw that follows. white of course, virtually has to accept. black checks. 11.kb5 still leads to a draw after 11...ne7!! 12.qh5! a5 13.qxe5 na6 14.kxa5 nb8+ 15.kb4 nbc6+ with equality. black checks. 12.kc3 has been suggested as a means to avoid the draw, but loses after 12...d4+ 13.kc4 be6+!! (13...b6? is unclear) 14.kxc5 nf6! (threatening mate in three with 15...nd7+ 16.kb5 c6+ 17.ka4 nc5# or nb6#) and white cannot avoid checkmate: 15.bb5+ ke7 (threatens 16...ne4#) 16.qf3 c6 (threatens 17...nd7#) 17.bxc6 rhc8 (threatens 18...nd7+ 19.kb5 bxc6+ 20.qxc6 and mate in five) 18.kb6 bxc6 (threatens 19...nd7+ 20.kb7 rab8+! 21.ka6 nc5+ 22.kxa5 rb5#) 19.qxf6+ and mate in eight follows. every move in the game after 12.kxc5 is forced. threatens 13...b6+ with ...bd7# to follow. white's only chance. this move too is forced. mate by b6 is threatened again. the only way out. not 14...bxc6? and the white king can no longer be mated. forced! black takes, with threats. not 16.c3?? nd4+! 17.cxd4 bd7#. another stunning sacrifice! not 17.kxb7?? kd7! 18.qg4+ kd6! and 19...rhb8# cannot be prevented. black checks again. not 18.ka4?? bc4! and 19...b5# cannot be prevented. with a draw by repetition.  many thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed this merry romp! please rate this annotation on the star system, and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing! 
-------------------------------------
the nimzo-larsen attack. the second most popular move, after 1… e5. a very strange move, more popular is 2… nf6, but practice favours black after 2… bg4, and no so much with 2… nf6. !? the litus gambit, strange-looking at first, but very fun to play. more popular nowadays is 3… bh5. attacking the e4-pawn. !? this is where the litus gambit starts to look even stranger. the queen now blocks in the f1-bishop, and it should be clear to black that the queen wants to go to b5, forking the king and bishop. the bishop can block, but the b7-pawn is unprotected. ?? a losing blunder, much better was 8… nc6! developing a piece and allowing the queen to protect the rook, but now things are going to start looking very ugly for black. ! showing why 8… nc6 was better. the threats on the white king are nothing, and the queen on d2 will provide as a target for white. the only move which doesn't lose. remember that if it wasn't for the queen on d2, then qc8 would be mate. the game is looking quite unpleasant for black don't you think? finally, black resigns, the queen is trapped and will soon be lost, plus there are threats of qxa8 and qc8+ and all sorts of stuff. hope you enjoyed, thank you!

i had never seen a game where this guy would have played anything else than 1.e4. now i start with my common reply against 1.e4. im quite sure that my opponent was waiting for najdorf as he knows that im bad loser and if i lose in one of my favourite openings i try it until i win but this time i didnt go for najdorf even that its one of my favourite openings. i was finally ready to launch dragon on official game as i had trained this opening very much and i was totally ready for ány kind of challenge in this opening. the rauzer attack, white is ready for long castling and start the pawn storm on king side. white lets black to start his counterplay on center, 9.bc4 is more often used nowadays. im going for the most aggressive option by sacrificing my pawn. white is accepts my aggressive challenge. now i have gained my compensation for lost pawn as i can attack whites queenside from open lines with support of my bishops. 14.qc5 is normal response but 14.qxa8 is really intresting as white changes his queen to rooks. this move might look odd but its totally okay. its not easy for white to defend and black has to be cautious too. this is intresting situation. this move was played in game smyslov-gufeld 1960. my opponent plays really accurately and he has shown to me that he knows dragon variation really well. smyslov-gufeld game continued 17.bb5 h5 18.rhd1 bxb2  19.kxb2 qxb5  and black has better position. my computer offered 17...e6 18.bc4 qe5 19.bd4 but i think that 17...h5 is as good as 17...e6. good move by white. best move from my view. my opponent plays good move again by putting my king on line and activating his bishop and rook. i dont know where from my head i heard "19.kh7, opponent will take take pawn and then you won" it was quite intresting that i had about 21min on my clock and i spent only 30s to make this move. my computer offered better option 19...qe5 20.bd4 qa5 21.bxg7 kxg7 22.re1 qxa2 23.kd1 qa1  24.ke2 and position is better for black. now my opponent made a mistake in time trouble, i dont know how i got this idea that my opponent will eat my pawn for sure, i was completely sure about it. 20.g4 hxg4 21.h5 would be the right way. this is the only winning move on this situation. not 23.a4 bxd4 24.rxd4 qc3 25.rc4 qa1  26.kd2 qxh1 white keeps playing accurately. well, it really doesnt matter where i move my king as long as i do not move it to g8 or h8. i still need to make accurate moves or this could end to draw. white resign. it is hard to say are those rooks better or worse than queen on these kind of situations. this time my queen proved to be better. our team went to victory as this game was last one so our team won match with result 3-2. 
-------------------------------------
solosky-canal variation is a good alternative for white if he wishes to avoid main line stuff. i used to play this years ago as a surprise weapon on otb play.   almost anything can be played here except for ...qd7 of course  not bad but this does allow black to gain space on the queen side by checking the lsb. usually, white tries to check the initiative by playing d4.   !? alternative variation: [ better is ] 5. bd3 ngf6 6. c3 [=][ white has some prospects. ]  strictly speaking white can not be happy with how things are turning out. black is far more advanced on the queen side. the lsb sits very well on the current diagonal.   deciding to develop the dsb on the g7 diagonal is a very good idea here because it is extremely difficult for white to shut it in. i am planning to setup a hedgehog formation which i love to play as black.   as i tell my chess students. if you play g7 then bg7 should always follow. no exceptions.   when white plays be3 in the sicilian he almost always wants to play qd2. especially if black has played the fianchetto. the reason for this is that later on white can setup all kinds of tactics on f6 and h6 with the support of the king pawns. but here this maybe a tad too early because this blocks the escape route of the dsb.  allowing black to play his next move.  alternative variation: [better is ] 10. f3 o-o 11. qd2 rc8 12. rad1 [=]  ?! allowing black to get in the advantageous ...e6 with inattentive.  alternative variation: 11. nd1 b5 12. f3 nxe3 13. nxe3 [=]  ?? this a typical mistake, white ignores the attack on one piece only to put two in danger. it is kinda like a rescue mission gone bad. where the rescuer ends up needing rescue too.  alternative variation: 12. nc3 nxe3 13. qxe3 o-o 14. rfd1 rc8 [⩱]  ! white is forced to give up a piece.   ?? white should have accepted his losses and enter damage control. instead he, goes all kamikaze on me. he attacks a point(...f6) that is well in black's control. no hope at all! alternative variation: 13. nf4 fxg5 14. ndxe6 bxe6 15. nxe6 qd7 16. nxg7+ qxg7 17. qxg5 ne5 18. f4 [ is bad but white still has a long shot chance. ]  ?? ok kamikaze tactics never really worked for the japanese and neither does it in chess.   a big "x" marks the spot with the d4-knight right in the cross-hairs  i am not so much as attacking the dsb but rather the f4 weak point. can you see how?  the art of combinations is what wins chess games. a combination is a series of three or more moves that leads to advantageous gain either material or positional. here it is both.   alternative variation: [just as good] 19... gxf4 20. qe2 e5 21. nf5 qf6 22. nxg7+ qxg7 [−⁠+]  ? white i think is trying to stay active. which is a good think when defending for your life. however, activity at the expense of a minus two pawn count is very bad. when defending you should avoid further material loss at all costs.   now i have a three point cross hair on f2.   if you have a chance use all of your pieces! white should have played rac1. who cares about the pawn on a2 when you have the cap in your cross hairs.   it is a very bad day when you feel that your best move is to drop yet another piece.   setting up a forced mate in 8.

i'll name this annotation "the trojan horse" - standard king's pawn opening épine dorsale - mutual king's pawn opening develop king's knight - which is customary for me leading to my preferred scotch game, or ruy lopez when i'm feeling more aggressive damiano defense - an inferior response damiano gambit - poison chess at it's greatest.  it's an enticing capture that should be avoided, because that "piece" offering comes with bad intentions. gambit accepted, a common mistake taking the knight - which i refer to as the trojan horse once the trojan horse has been invited inside the walls of troy, it's only a matter of time before the spartans sack the city.   from my frame of reference, checkmate is inevitable at this point keep black's king in check, to separate further from his defenses only option for black continued development for white, all while black's future options are continuing to look bleak bad option for black, sacrificing the queen's pawn in order to free up the queen's bishop, while attacking white's kb, would have been a more prudent option the spartans are running wild in the city! only move at this point, when your king is beyond your defenses - it's not a good place to be again, continued development for white while keeping black in check only move available for black, # of moves for checkmate is dependent upon white's response first move in many that white does not check black (please see above comment) shouldn't have been surprised by another poor move by black, although i was....  black may have prolonged checkmate by kb to e7 it's as good as over with another check only option for black checkmate in 11 - take away, avoid poison pieces & expect the unexpected through respect of your opponent, assume their "mistake" was made intentionally - with bad intentions...  read sun tzu's art of war for a fuller appreciation of these strategic theories.

this was one of 6 gameknot games i played simultaneously with my opponent. i lost two, drew 3 and won this. some of those draws were very lucky, when my opponent kindly offered me a draw although i was a clear pawn down in a couple of them. in this game he loses as one of his knights goes out on a solo run to win a pawn, but ends up losing itself for two pawns. i manage to convert a lead of a knight for two pawns into a win - but we both make a lot os mistakes along the way! in a couple of games he had beaten me very quickly and very easily with the blackmar–diemer gambit, after 1. d4 nf6, 2. nc3 d5 3.e4. i wanted to try and find out what he would play against it himself. but instead he transposes into a benoni. this version of the benoni is considered better for white however, as the normal c2-c4 has not been played. the square c4 is available for a knight or bishop. g6, d6 and e5 are all more common at this point. i reinforce my centre.  he prevents the d5-d6 push. i'm following the gameknot opening databases as usual! he develops. i throw in a check. he blocks. i take. he takes back. i exchange bishops. he takes back. interestingly on the world database taking back with the queen is the only move given. taking with the knight can hardly be bad surely? as played in longtail99 (1922) vs. sualksnh (2472), in a tournament called "play the trompowsky attack!" so obviously with a different move order. that game continued with ne5 instead of a6. a6 is given as a mistake by the post match computer analysis (pmca). so this is the first move i did entirely off my own bat. pmca says it is a mistake and prefers nf4! oh well..... so this move comes in at last. so i hit the knight. and of it goes, on a solo adventure from which it will never come back. i hit the knight. knight comes in. i prevent the knight escaping to c4. he takes the pawn. i hit the knight, which finds it has no escape squares. so it takes a pawn and i take the knight. i am knight for two pawns up now. attacking the bishop, but making his d5 square weak and his d6 pawn backward. i retreat. he castles. i move my king to a safer square. he prepares to use his queen against my king. so i move it again. i actually will have lovely open f and g files against his king, and more crucially there is just one open file, the f file, on which i have excellent chances of exchanging off rooks. of course, being materially up, i want to exchange off pieces, but not pawns... the queen comes out. i prevent the knight check. he moves his king to a safer square. i mobilise my other rook. this check is actually a horrible mistake. i thought "i can't play 21. rxg4 as then he can play rxf1". however i missed 22. ng3, forking queen and rook, so winning the rook back. i think i missed this, because i was a bit in awe of my opponent, who had beaten me in one game, and was winning in a couple of others, and it just didn't occur to me that he might accidently throw away another knight! but hey, i'm still winning surely? piece exchanges favour me, and his bishop and two pawns are certainly not worth my two knights. d5 is going to be a tremendous square for one of them soon, surely? so i take back. he hits my queen. queen comes across. preparing bf4, but it only results in more piece exchanges. so i trade rooks. he recaptures. i contest the open file. he takes. i keep my queen on the f4 square. this doesn't actually achieve anything, just allows more exchanges, which favours me. computer says this is a mistake, and qg4 was better. maybe, but this is simpler. computer prefers the queen recapture, but that allows me to exchange queens, and simple win in the ending. so now i do play qg4 he has to make a flight square for his king. i throw in a queen check. forced! now only one pawn for the knight. his king comes up. knight finally reaches d5. not ke6, qe7 mate! so i check. king up again. computer says this is a mistake, but i think it is by far the easier way to win. so he takes. i take back, hitting the h pawn. pawn advances. ne8 also wins, but this is better. i need to go after his potentially strong kingside pawns. he saves his h pawn. i attack it again. at this point we did a deal, at my suggestion. he resigned this, and in return i resigned a game where i was 2 pawns down without any compensation. i was a bit surprised at his resignation comment. "i think i could draw this with good play...but as you insist i'll resign". i tend to disagree, i think this position is pretty hopeless for black. he has only one pawn for the knight. he is losing one of his kingside pawns for my e pawn. my king easily blocks his passed f pawn. my knight can quickly and easily jump from the queenside to the kingside, as necessary. but i'd be interested in your view near reader! so please leave a comment or two, and please rate it on the star system.

by common agreement we are playing the ruy lopez, which makes the next couple of moves mandatory... with this move we enter into the ruy lopez. black has a number of options here, though by far the most common continuation is (as indeed played in the game) 3...a6. apart from that, black may opt for 3...nf6 (berlin defence), 3...f5 (jaenitsch gambit / schliemann defence), 3...d6 (steinitz defence), 3...bc5 (cordel variation), 3...nd4 (bird defence). either of these are emininently playable, though only the berlin defence currently enjoys any real popularity. the murphy defence, forcing an immediate declaration from white: will you exchange, or do you retreat? white opts for the exchange variation. for a long time thought to be completely harmless for black, until bobby fischer turned it into a dangerous weapon in the 1960s. white has a slight lead in development and a superior pawn structure. recapturing with the d-pawn opens lines for both queen and bishop, significantly lessening the impact of white's development. in principle, black should at least consider a recapture with the b-pawn, as the general rule for pawn capture is "always capture towards the center". but though correct in its general principle, capturing with the b-pawn is hardly recommendable in this specific position. for instance, 4...bxc6 5.o-o d6 6.d4 exd4 7.qxd4 c5 8.qd3 and black's pawn formation is stymied, his development non-existent, and his position close to untenable. the proffered sacrifice of the e5 pawn is purely illusory. on 5.nxe4? black has two forceful replies: 5...qg5 and 5...qd4. either will affort black a superior position, eg.: 5.nxe5? qd4 6.nf3 qxe4+ 7.qe2 qxe2+ 8.kxe2 bg4 9.re1 o-o-o 10.kf1 bxf3 11.gxf3 bd6 -+. in the game position, the current main move - and white's most flexible choice - is 5.0-0. before the days of bobby fischer the most common continuation was 5.d4, which offers a considerable simplification of the position. white has castled and his position is sound if not very threatening. black, on the other hand, has lost the only developed piece he had (nc6) so that all of his officers are now still on the back rank. however, his position is not so bad as all that, as he does have the half-open d-file and open lines for his bishops and queen. what he needs now, more than anything else, is to keep the position reasonably closed while getting his king whisked away to safety - and he needs to protect his e-pawn too while doing it. there are various ways of achieving this, including the unpretentious 5...f6, and the more spectacular but ultimately dubious 5...bg4 6.h3 h5!? before the days of computer-assisted opening analysis this move would be regarded as ugly, premature, foolhardy, and a waste of time. today, it is one of the main lines in the spanish exchange variation - though still regarded as ugly. its redeeming features make up for its unsightliness however: it keeps up pressure on the d-file, vacates the back row in preparation for castling long, opens up for the possibility of transferring the queen to the king-side in preparation for a k-side attack on white's position, and it supports the pawn on e5. a measure of the strength of this move is that white cannot just wrench open the position by 6.d4; black is fine after 6...exd4 7.qxd4 qxd4 8.nxd4 bd7. planning to harass black's queen while preserving the option of opening the center quickly and efficiently by means of d2-d4. black considered various options here, including 6...qe6 and 6...b5. of these, he evaluated the pawn move as clearly the stronger, as it would both restrict the mobility of white's night and expand his control of q-side space. additionally, 6...qe6 would place both queen and king on the e-file, at a time when opening this file would indeed seem to be a possible, tactical resource for white. still, 6...qe6 is playable, as demonstrated by romanishin in his rather nice win against fiorido: 6...qe6 7.d4 exd4 8.nxd4 qf6 9.re1 bd7 10.e5 qg6 11.e6 fxe6 12.nc4 o-o-o 13.bf4 c5 14.nf3 bc6 15.qe2 qf5 16.qe3 nf6 17.nfe5 nd5 18.qa3 qxf4 19.nxc6 qxc4 20.nxd8 kxd8 21.rad1 bd6 22.qh3 nf6 23.b3 qg4 24.qe3 qh5 25.h3 re8 26.qd3 kc8 27.rd2 e5 28.rde2 e4 29.qc3 qg5 30.qe3 qe5 31.g3 qh5 32.kg2 nd5 33.qd2 qf3+ 34.kg1 e3 35.fxe3 qxg3+ 36.rg2 qe5 37.e4 nf4 38.rh2 ng6 39.rhe2 nf4 40.rh2 g5 41.c4 nd3 {0-1 fiorido, g. (2127) - romanishin, o. (2511) / 3. forni di sopra open, ita 2012. black gains space on the queenside and white will have to spend additional tempi if he is to activate his knight on a3. still, this does little to allay the fundamental challenge in black's position: his precariously placed king. indeed, in some respects the pawn move actually enhances the danger to black's king: he can no longer rely on castling long, which means that white may gain dangerous pressure on his position once the center pawn on e5 has been exchanged. the straightaway advance to d4 is not that dangerous however, as black is fine once the queens have been exchanged off the board: 7.d4 exd4 8.nxd4 c5 9.nf3 qxd1 10.rxd1 be6. the logical, maybe even necessary move, freeing up c2 for the knight while adding weight to the eventual d4 advance. but there are problems as well: first and foremost, the c-pawn advance to c3 leaves the d-pawn backwards and creates a gaping weakness on d3. this in itself is quite enough to cast the whole na3 variation into doubt, in my mind. the more so as black has a splendid rejoinder available... the logical response. advancing the d-pawn to d4 will now gain white nothing, while black stands to get rid of his doubled c-pawn weakness. meanwhile, the center is still closed, which means black is not unduly bothered by not having had a chance to castle his king yet. or, stated another way: the closed position negates any significant advantage that white might otherwise have stood to gain from his greater development, while black has achieved already a marked positional advantage by means of the half-open d-file, pressure against white's weaknesses on d2 and d3, and his significantly greater mobility on both q-side and k-side. in a very real sense, initiative has now shifted to black; white just hasn't discovered it yet. on 8.d4 black will reply 8...cxd4 9.cxd4 exd4 10.nxd4 c5 after which his mobile q-side majority gives him the better chances. sticking to the planned d4-advance - which would, if black allowed it, actually equalize the game. however ... and white is stuck! the d-pawn stays put, the weakness on d3 is now glaringly obvious, and the doubled c-pawn actually serves to reinforce black's q-side control. white's position is seriously cramped and his pieces have little mobility to speak of. meanwhile, the center remains closed and black has no worries about the safety of his king. gives white a little more space while pressuring the c4 pawn. reinforces c4 while developing a piece. white gains control of the b-file after 10.bxc4 bxc4 11.rb2, but it is hardly useful for him: he cannot hope to equalize unless he can neutralize the weakness on d3. though rather obvious, i tend to regard this move as being a slight error: it merely serves to prompt black into a response he would like to do anyway, which means it is likely a loss of time. on the other hand, the bishop does need to get moved off the 1st rank, and it is hardly better placed on b2. possibly 10.qe2 is the better move. very strong. black reinforces his control of d4 while effective blocking off the bishop diagonal and wrestling b4 away from the knight. the doubled c-pawns are now revealed as a significant strength rather than a weakness. forces the ensuing exchange, as 11...nf6 12.bxc4 bxc4 13.qa4+ ke7 14.nxc4 bxc4 15.qxc4 leaves white with a clear advantage. white has removed the cramp on c4 and gains a mobile pawn flank on the q-side. the fundamental weakness on d3 still exists however. a key position in the game. black has almost regained parity in development, and anyhow the position is still closed to a significant degree, so white's lead in development matters little. what does matter is white's weakness on d3 and his relative lack of space (mobility). all of which will disappear in a moment, unless black can somehow block the threatened d2-d4 advance. and there it is! the queen serves to physically restrain the pawn from advancing, while at the same time forcing white to reply to the threatened capture on e4. the obvious reply, 13.qc2, fails due to 13...qxc2 14.nxc2 bxb3. quite good. black either has to move his bishop off the b3 diagonal (thus solving a significant problem for white) or accept being saddled with yet another, doubled pawn - and an isolated one at that. however, as we have already seen, doubled pawns are not always a weakness - and in this case it will serve to give black an almost immutable lock on the center. developing with added pressure on e4. this will serve as adequate replacment for the soon-to-be-gone bishop. virtually forced, or white will have achieved nothing. and we have the doubled pawns - again. this time the effect is possibly even stronger: though isolated and thus - in principle! - quite weak, they are actually a close to deciding feature on the board, affording black a virtually unbreakable hold on the center and effectively neutering white's knight on e3. the only way of protecting e4. unfortunately, this also creates an additional weakness as it opens the diagonal onto the white king. black now needs to find a way to continue the pressure, noting that an immediate 15...b4 avails him not at all after 16.bb2. a necessary move, as black needs to castle and activate his rooks. but nonetheless, this affords white a breathing pause and thus a chance to reorganize his pieces. it is difficult to find anything better though; settling the bishop on d6 would prevent the queen from retreating at need. a rather defensive-looking move, but with teeth: white vacates the a-file for his rook, which means black's rook on a8 is now severely limited in its mobility, and prepares for an eventual c3-c4 advance with a discovered threat against black's e5. the pawn on e5 is not seriously threatened yet, and black needs both his rooks in offensive roles. as black needs to remobilize his knight on f6 anyway, this is hardly an embarrasment for him. aiming the knight - once it has fulfilled its defensive duty towards e5 - against the weaknesses on b4 and d4. white prepares to add pressure against the backwards pawn on a6 (alternatively, to defend against a breakthrough on the q-side). but before any such pressures can be brought to bear, he will have to find a more permanent solution to his center weaknesses. the pawn on d2 is locked solid; it can advance to d3 and no further. retracting the queen will allow black to remobilize the knight and add more pressure on white's creaking formations. on 19.cxb5 black gains a clear advantage after 19...axb5 20.qa1 rxa2 21.qxa2 qxd2. it's difficult to white to find a plan forward, so he settles for locking down the q-side as much as possible. black wants to keep pressure on the d-file, so this makes more sense than trying to reinforce b5. white may, in this position, want to keep pressure on the a-file in turn, in which case black will have to be precise: 20.qa1 bd8! with the idea 21.ra2 bc7 and white can no longer prevent black from relocating his knight: nd7-b8-c6-d4, as black may (if required) advance a6-a5 and thus keep his a-pawn covered. an important point in the board postion here - and the reason why black has to play precisely - is that he does **not** want to open the d-file prematurely. after 20.qa1 qxd2?! 21.ng4 qc2 22.qa2 bd8 23.bxe5 qxa2 24.rxa2 white has equalized and may even have a slight advantage. while 20.qa1 bd8 21.ra2 qxd2? 22.bc1! qd4 23.qb1 qd6 24.rd1 actually hands the d-file -and the advantage - over to white completely! this however, is entirely too passive. white would be better off going for the more exacting 20.qa1 (as detailed in the comment to 19...b4). likely he underestimated the effect of the ensuing knight maneuvre. black needs to activate the knight. on d7 it is entirely passive, besides blocking up the valuable d-file. white's best play here is probably to do the same: ne3-g4-f2, and black is left with a very difficult task trying to break through, seeing as how white seems able to block the q-side advance by the simple (though expensive) expedient of placing his rook on a4. as an alternative to the g4-f2 knight maneuver, white is now able to perform the same relocation by means of d1. the game move has the added advantage of moving the white queen off the d-file and giving room for the rook to take its place there. the knight is well placed here, and far more active than it was on d7. white should now retreat 22.ra4, in order to block black's q-side ambitions, after which 22...bd8 would probably be imprecise as black cannot hope to break through on the q-side while that rook is on a4, which means the bishop is likely to prove of better use on the k-side after all. the rook retreats too far. it would be better placed on a2 (where it would help cover the 2nd rank and offer the prospect of working together with the rook on f1 in quickly and decisively seizing control of any open file that may present itself), and far better placed on a4. it is clear for black that any hopes he may have of winning the game is and must be closely linked with a breakthrough on the q-side. it is thus important to advance those pawns as far as possible, so that the eventual q-side breakthrough (or even the threat of one) will prove decisive. thus for instance an immediate 23.qc2, aiming to block any further advance of the pawn, may now be countered by the interesting - and probably decisive - pawn sacrifice 23...a4! 24.bxa4 rfd8, after which 25.rfd1 nd4 26.bxd4 qxd4 27.qf2 b3 should win for black. white correctly perceives that any active counterplay must happen on the k-side, but there is little hope of this advance ever bearing fruit. black is too well poised in the center for a counterattack on the flank to have any perceivable chance of success. preparing to take advantage of the open lines in white's camp while blocking any ideas white may have about advancing the f-pawn. now interesting complications arise after 24.ng4 nd4, on which 25.qd1 h5 26.nf2 nxf3+ 27.kg2 where the sharp rejoinder 27...nd2!? is probably premature due to 28.re1 rf3 29.qxf3!? nxf3 30.kxf3 with an unclear position. black is ahead on points but may find it very difficult to break through. less good for white is 25.bxd4?! qxd4+ 26.qf2 qxd3 27.qxc5 rxf3 28.rxf3 qxf3 and white's position is in shambles. prudent. the knight is an important defender and control of e3 is vital for white. white's 23rd move (g3) now looks like serious mistake; rather than vitalizing white's k-side, it now reveals itself as a near-fatal weakening of the important pawn on f3. if that pawn could advance, the weakness may have been turned to a strength ... but it can't. and because it can't escape the pressure being levelled against it, it threatens to bring the whole edifice crashing down round white's king. black's knight, magnificantly poised on d4, commands the whole board. the threat against b3 has to be replied to, and retreating the queen to d1 to cover it is inadvisable as black can simply pile up pressure on the f-file until something gives, eg.: 25.qd1 rf7 26.f4 raf8 27.fxg5 rxf1+ 28.qxf1 rxf1+ 29.rxf1 nxb3 and black wins. thus, white is compelled to this exchange a forcing move. white cannot move the king away, as 26.kh1 rfd8 27.rfd1 qc3 28.rab1 a4! 29.bxa4 rxa4 gives black the q-side breakthrough he needs to win. additionally, white cannot block with the rook: 26.rf2 rfd8 27.rd1 a4 28.f4 a3! is a clear win for black (29.fxg5 a2 etc.). black has succeeded in denuding d3 of defenders, but he cannot take immediate advantage of that: capturing the pawn now would be premature, as 26...qxd3 allows 27.qxc5! with complications, eg.: 27...qxb3 28.qxe5 be3+ 29.nxe3 qxe3+ 30.kh1 qb6 (black must cover the pawn on e6 or hand the center over to white entirely) 31.rfd1 and white has counterplay though black is still better. the 'intuitive' reply here would be to recapture with the rook. it would also be ... wrong. white needs to capture with the king here, even if it does place the king in an exposed position, entering a half-open center and looking down the throat of a hostile rook with only a weak pawn as shield. but if he doesn't - if he captures with the rook instead - his monarch is going to turn out to be too far away from the q-side pawns to be able to avert the disaster looming there. only by capturing with his king, getting that one, vital step closer to the front, can he equalize the game now. let's look at some lines: 27.kxf2! rf7 28.ra4 raf8 29.ke2 (29.ne1 bd2!) 29...bd8 and white has equalized. or 27...bd2!? 28.ke2! bc3 29.ra4 and black cannot break through (and likewise, any attempt by white to open the center will free black's bishop to range the board again). that said, this line actually does represent black's best attempt at a win, as white has to play rather exactly to ensure equality. for instance 28.ra2?! bc3 29.ke2 a4 30.bxa4 ra5 31.kd1 rfa8 32.kc2 rxa4 33.rxa4 rxa4 and black has a clear advantage. or 28.ne3 bc3 29.ra2 a4 30.bxa4 ra5 31.nd1 bd4+ 32.ke2 rfa8 33.nb2 bxb2 34.rxb2 rxa4 and black should win. on first blush this has several advantages on the king capture: it prepares for a doubling of the rooks on either the a- or f-file, and it enhances the collective mobility of the rooks. true, there is a potential weakness insofar as the king and the rook are now on the same diagonal, but the knight on g2 serves well to guard against black placing his bishop on e3 to fork the rook. the actual problem with 27.rxf2 is less obvious - as detailed in the previous annotation: the king remains on the g-file and without influence on the central and q-side scenes. black takes immediate advantage. the bishop on g5 prevents the f2 rook from entering the defence of the weak pawn on d3, and the rook on a1 cannot move away from the a-file or black will break through with an immediate a5-a4. and the knight, of course, cannot move either, or black will win the exchange by means of bg4-e3. white has prepared for those problems however, and after this advance everything seems fine. more than fine actually, as white gains both initiative and a slight advantage after 28...exf4 29.gxf4 bh6 30.rf3: any activity black may wish to initiate on the q-side is easily neutralized by a thrust by white's, now very mobile e- and f-pawns. unfortunately for white, black does not have to capture on f4... even worse was 29.rd2 exf4 30.rf1 bd4+ 31.kh1 fxg3 ... the immediate 29...a4!? is also playable, but the game move has the advantage of blocking white's rf2 away from the action, as white has to retake with the rook: 30.gxf4 bd4 is simply awful for white, and 20.nxf4 bd4 31.nxe6 bxf2+ isn't much better. forced, but unfortunate: moving away from the 2nd rank gives black the option of boxing it out of the game for now. blocks off the important f2 square, preventing the rook from reentering the game there. nor can the king take advantage of the chance to come back again: 31.kf1 e5! 32.rf3 a4 33.bxa4 rxa4 34.ke2 (even worse: 34.ne3 bxe3 35.rxe3 rf8+ 36.ke1 ra2 37.rd2 b3 38.ree2 ra1+ 39.rd1 rxd1+ 40.kxd1 rf1+ 41.kd2 b2 and white can resign) 34...ra2+ 35.rd2 rxd2+ 36.kxd2 ra8 37.ne1 bc3+ 38.kd1 ra1+ and wins. with the king forced away from the action, black is now free to enjoy all the benefits of a q-side breakthrough. forcing the issue, and better now than later: black would gain little and risk much by delaying this unnecessarily. precise play is required though, should white go for the complications arising from 32.rff1!? to which black's best reply is 32...axb3 (closer analysis reveals that it is a required feature of the position that black can keep white's knight away from c2: with the knight posted there, the a-pawn cannot queen) 33.nf4 rd6 34.rb1 b2 35.ne2 be5 after which 36.d4!? fails to 36...cxd4 37.c5 rc6 and the rook cannot capture the intrepid pawn on b2 due to d4-d3. black must not succumpt to the temptation and mindlessly reply 32...rxa4: a waste of time which might cost him the very victory he has worked so hard to ensure. the endgame is quite complex, for instance: 32...rxa4 33.rb1 ra3 34.rf3 be5 35.ne1 b3 36.d4 bxd4 37.rfxb3 and white has equalized. or 34.ne1 (instead of 34.rf3) 34...b3 35.rf1 b2 36.nc2 be5 37.kg2 d4 (not 38.kf3 ra1 39.nxa1 bxa1=q 40.rxa1 rxa1 and black has won) 38.d4! bxd4 39.nxd4 cxd4 40.rxb2 with complex play. with this (temporary) pawn sacrifice, black wins an extremely important tempo. the advanced b-pawn restricts white's options significantly. thus 33.rb1 b2 34.rff1 rxa4 35.nf4 rda8 36.nxe6 ra1 37.nxd4 rxb1 38.rxb1 ra1 and black wins. or 33.ne1 rxa4 34.nf3 be3!! (prevents the bishop from being captured, forces the rook off the f-file and deeper into obscurity, and prevents the knight from reentering the game through d2) 35.rg4 b2 36.rb1 ra1 and black wins. bolsters the 1st rank and vacates f4 for the knight. but with the pawn on b3 already, it cannot be captured merely - at best - contained. and even that will prove impossible. keeps the knight out of the game, and the wonderfully centralized bishop keeps a1 under tight control. white could try to bring the knight back with 34.rb1 b2 35.ne1, but black will counter with 35...bc3 36.rf3 rxa4 37.nc2 rda8 38.rff1 ra1 39.nxa1 bxa1=q 40.rxa1 rxa1 and black wins. the central point of black's play: with the pawn still on b3, the knight still cannot move on to c2, and thus remains locked out of the battle. as an added benefit (from black's point of view) it now disrupts the communication between the rooks as well. black may consider simply capturing the a4 pawn now, as 34...rxa4 35.nf3 bc3 36.rc1 rxd3 37.kg2 rxc4 is clearly won. black decided to up the pressure on white's position first. on 35.rc1 there now follows 35...b2, while 35.rb1 is answered by 35...bxe1 36.rfxe1 rxd3 37.re2 rxa4 38.reb2 rxc4 39.rxb3 rxb3 40.rxb3 rxe4 with a winning end-game. a very nice trap. if now 35...rxa4? white slinks out of his troubles by means of 36.nd2! b2 37.nb1 and he has suddenly equalized after all. black cannot go for 37...ra1 as 38.nxc3 rxd3 39.nb1 rxd1 40.rxd1 is simply lost. simple and direct. offers up the bait again: 36...rxa4? would lead to the same trap as before. but now, white is simply lost. the weak d-pawn has fallen at last, and with it any coherence in white's position. black may now choose to enter via the d-file as well as the a-file, and white cannot block him any more. offers to block the pawn with the knight while exchanging rooks. black accepts. exchanging the rooks greatly simplifies the win. move the bishop out of the shadow of the knight, blocks the d-file, and covers all three pawns at the same time as well as preventing nc3 for the time being. the knight must remain to cover b1. brings the rook into play and threatens to remove the pawn preventing c5 from linking up with the b-pawn. exchanging on a3 would now be a major mistake. vacates the a-file, but the checks there are reasonably harmless. the check on c1 is, however, anything but. moves the king into cover. black has to consider the possibility here that the white pawns could actually move to mate him, if used in conjunction with the king and rook. he has, however, sufficient resources to prevent this with only moderately careful play. the king cannot move back to the 1st rank or the knight will be lost (after rc1+). threatens mate after rxh2. on 49.nd2 black would simply reply 49...c4! which wins: 50.ke3 c3 51.nb1 c2 etc. and white resigns.

a game from gameknot, that i needed to win for a mini tournament 1st place. gk computer analysis available here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=26085158&fb=1&rnd=0.8105011886182563  a bit passive, this block white bishop. at least, we are out of books. kind of reflex when opponent plays c3. the queen can be centralized without tempo loss after nc3. avoid queen exchange in case of dxe, and keep an eye on e4 and f2. computer gave a ?!. well, white still didn't develop bishop nor knight, and both f3 and h3 are weaken. so nf3, be2 0-0 was better.  black develop (classic) i didn't play bc4 preventing rock, because of nd2, missing that bd3 attacking the queen was good for black. now rd1 threaten to take the column, so i leave a place in e7 for the queen and prepare for re8. black is a slight edge thanks to better development. inaccuracy. ng5 to give white bishop pair, then play nef3 and finish development (bg5, rad1 etc...) leads to equality. this direct f2 attack is annoying. i prefer it to computer's line (rad8 12.nb3 bb6 13. bg5 where black finish development protect f2 take the d-column and intend to reinforce it rd6 rfd8 and may be the queen. computer propose b4! bd6, then h3. in case of bb6, i assume b5! then after nb8 pawn in e5 is weak, and so is black "attack". according to computer, bxf2 is an "easy" win : 13. h3 bxf2+ 14. kh1 ne3 15. qa4 nxg2 16. rxf2 ne3. alternative 14. rxf2 leads to game continuation.  computer propose 14. b4 nxe4+ 15. bxc5 nxg3 16. re1 qxc5+ 17. kh2 nf5 18. ne4 qa5 19. nfg5 bd5 20. bd2 f6 21. c4 ncd4 22. bxa5 nxc2 which is clearly not deep enough to conclude. when i played ng4, i had this position in mind, with nb4 coming, white king in the center, and a big + in development for black. no mat nor material advantage in mind, just threats. computer suggest main line 16. ke2 nb4 17. qb1 (cxn??qxq) nd3 18. kd1 (else qf2+ then qxb) qf2 19. bf1 nb4 20. be2 (else qxf1+ qd3+ qxf3+) nxa2 21. bd3 (else bb3+) qxg3 22. kc2 nxc1 where black grab all white kings pawns. i considered this the only move to prevent nd3 followed by qf2#. actually after 17. qa4 nd3 18. ke2 qf2+ 19. kd1 qxg2 there is no mat (black is wining still) ?? so focused on the qf2 threat, i missed the simple bc4+ that win the queen (knight e2 is pined and if ke1, then nd3+ followed by nxb2+(discovery) and nxd1) after this forced defense, there is no clear win. i decided to open the game to take advantage of my better development. opening f column, whatever black play. may be less good, but more interesting than grabbing a pawn by bxa2 (if rxb, nxbc1) attack the queen and try to achieve queen side development. keep the center (e5 and d3) and "x-ray" g3 computer spot this as a mystake, but proposed alternative 21. kg1 e4 22. ng5 qxg3 23. qe3 nxc1 24. qxg3 ne2+ 25. kh2 nxg3 26. kxg3 rd3+ seems doomed for white either. i rejected nf4 due to bxf4, missing bd3 that win the queen. critical line was … nf4 22. qxe5 (if qe1 then bd3+, ne2+etc...) qd1+ 23. ne1 (kf2? nd3+ loose q) nxg2 24. kxg2 (else be4+) rfe8 25. bf4 bb1 26. rxb1 qxb1 27. qxc7 qxe1 where black ends with 2 rook versus b+n. according to gk computer, the position is almost equal. i am only confident that it is a big mess ^_^ free the way to f2 for the rook. nh4 was better, to protect the g2 bishop (and exchange g6 bishop in some variation) enter the weak square forced to avoid qg3. but it blocks the c1 bishop. double on the open column this lead to a mat in 5. can you spot it ? according to computer, white is doomed anyway (25. nd4 ne1 26. qxf2 rxf2 27. kxf2 nd3+ 28. kg1 qg3 29. kh1 qe1+ 30. kh2 nxc1 31. nf5 bxf5 32. gxf5 qd2 33. nxe4 qxb2 ) ?? loose gk hard chess puzzle. answer was :  25. nxe4 bxe4 26. qf3 r8xf3 27. bf4 nxf4 28. bxf3 nxh3+ 29. kh1 bxf3# i only saw that white queen is forced to sacrifice to prevent rf2 qh2#  there is still a mat in 6 i didn't spot the mat in 6. but if qxb rf2+ with qh2#.  or if kh1 move rf3 leads to the win. so black resign. thank you for reading, feel free to add your coments and 1 star. ^_^

the second game i have annotated in this mini-tournament. this was quite an interesting game as it involved my pawn chain trap such as the one i used in my game against eldominicano34 (see this link for the annotation http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/lets-play-chess?gm=37916) a normal sicilian move i hadn't seen this before but continued on as normal. i didn't want to play this as it drew my queen out very early but the other combination forced it. a pin not to dissimilar to that of the 6. bg5 najdorf. know my pawn trap begins the computer analysis showed that he should have played qd8 long before doubles my forces on the d-file and takes my king away from the center. i had to queenside castle because of my kingside pawn chain attack. before this game had ended i had planned on giving it an !! because of these combinations:  14. bf3 (i believe this is the nail in the coffin) 14.bf3 d5 15. exd6 rb8 16.d7 kd8 17. dxe8 = q+ kxc8 18. qd8# 17... rxc8 18. qxd7# 17... ke7 18. qcd7# 16... ke7 17. d8 = q# 14... rb1 15. bc6 dxc6 16. qd8# 15... (no real strong reply) kd8 16. bxd7 (fall into already planned checkmate lines. you can see this above but slightly different.) bxd7 17. qxd7# 15... ke7 (prolongs) 16. qd6+ kd8 17. qxb8 (5 points behind and in a tight situation) 16... ke8 same as above 17. qxb8 14... bb7 15. bxb7 (forces) rd8 (all other rook moves = mate with (16. qxd7#) 16. bxc6 dxc6 17. qxd8# 16... ke7 17. qd6+ ke8 18. bxd7+ rxd7 19 qxd7# another possible way to prolong it is qxc2+ at any time kxc2 means game is basically over because of large point deficit. also leaving rook on a8 and doing something else results in losing the rook and having large point deficit. there are also some other moves but they all still leave black so far behind the only chance of victory is time out or some horrendous blunders.   i didn't see bc5 causes me to move queen he can then castle into safety however the computer anylasis said this was a mistake and said rb8 was a better move because of best: +3.59 » … rb8 15. qc4 bc5 16. b4 be3+ 17. kb2 o-o 18. qd3 qxd3 19. rxd3 bc5 20. bxc5 bxc5+ 21. ka1 f6 22. rb1 rxb1+ 23. kxb1 fxe5 24. fxe5. however i wouldn't have played 15. qc4 because i wanted a quick checkmate. why he doesn't recapture i don't know this stops r(b or f)d8 pinning the bishop i knew this was coming and planned on playin qc3 unexpected as he loses the exchange a blunder because of qxd7 luckily he didn't see it doubling my rooks i knew i would lose the knight but could capture the bishop the computer described this as a mistake but i wanted to trade queens as i could use my pawn and rook advantage to win the endgame i saw a mating combo wanting to play 32.qe7 but after 32... qxc7+ i have to play 33.ka3 because 33.ka1 ends in forced mate. also after 32...qxc2+ 33. ka3 qc1+ 34. ka4 bc6+ 35. kb4 qc5+ 36. qxc5 bxc5+ 37. kxc5 bxd7 38. rxd7 (white has strong end game) also after 34. kb4 position can be interesting however what i planned on playing you will see next. black resigns because he is unable to avoid mate 
-------------------------------------
i wanted to share this game because it made and impression on me and i can't get it out of my head :d. i recommend that you watch the game in interactive move.i will only annotate a few moves with alternative routes since this game is played at gm level and its the manifestation of the word logic :d. white doesn’t get much from 7. nxe5 nxe5 8. d4 bxd4 9. qxd4 nc6. white’s extra pawn in the ending outweighs his doubled pawns after 17...nxf3+ 18.nxf3 bxf3 19. qxf3 qxf3 20. gxf3. a likely draw would result from 27...rfd8! 28 bd5 nxb2 29 bxf7+ kh7 30 rxd8 bxd8 31 be3 nd1 32 bxc5 nxc3. black is a pawn down without compensation but this only hastens his defeat. (!) and black resigns. every white and every black piece is hanging! if 33...rxb5 34. ra8 mates. also futile is 33...rxe4 34. rxb8+ kh7 35. rxf7, losing the exchange and a pawn. finally, if 33...nxf2+ 34.kg2 ree8 (not 34...nxe4? 35.rxb8+ kh7 36.rxe7) 35.rxb8 rxb8 36.kxf2, losing the knight for a pawn. 
-------------------------------------
excelente jogada! com esse lance, a dama e um bispo foram desbloqueados, e na sua próxima vez de jogar as brancas já terão mais alternativas: esse movimento começou a deixar as peças brancas menos asfixiadas. uma outra qualidade desse lance: ocupa o centro do tabuleiro. o centro do tabuleiro: são as 4 casas d4d5e4e5. é uma região estratégica, e quem domina o centro fica com mais chances de dominar a partida. as pretas respondem na mesma moeda: esse lance tem as mesmas qualidades do lance anterior das brancas, e é uma reação correta, pois quando seu adversário ocupa o centro você deve brigar com ele para disputar esse rico espaço! ótimo lance. f3 é uma "casa natural" para o cavalo, e deve ser sempre uma boa escolha para os seus lances iniciais. o cavalo saiu das margens e se aproximou do centro, e com isso ficou com muito mais raio de manobra. na posição inicial ele só tinha 3 casas (2 das quais estavam ocupadas por suas outras peças), e em f3 ele passou a ter oito casas para ir (apenas 3 estão ocupadas por suas próprias peças, e 1 casa, d4,  está protegida pelo peão preto. além disso, essa foi uma jogada de ataque! o cavalo ameaça capturar o peão preto. é claro que é bem fácil se defender dessa ameaça, mas o que importa é que as pretas perderam a liberdade, pois obrigatoriamente precisam providenciar uma defesa para o peão atacado. jogada interessante, que configura a "defesa petroff". aqui, a resposta mais comum seria com o outro cavalo em c6 - nessa casa o cavalo protegeria o peão: se as brancas capturam o peão preto, as pretas capturam o cavalo! mas deixemos de lado cc6, pois o lance da partida foi o cf6. a defesa petroff é uma linha de abertura interessante, mas eu recomendaria a nenhum iniciante que se especializasse nela. aqui as pretas resolvem a ameaça ao peão por meio de um contra-ataque: se o cavalo branco toma o peão preto (que é a continuação mais comum), o cavalo preto pode tomar o peão branco, e fica "elas por elas" (embora seja melhor, antes disso, avançar o peão da dama para d6, "expulsando" o cavalo branco. ótima resposta: as brancas mantém a tensão no centro, desmanchando o trabalho de defesa feito pelas pretas (pois agora não é possível responder à perda do peão preto com a captura do peão branco, pois isso deixaria o cavalo preto perdido).. e o melhor é que as brancas fazem isso simplesmente desenvolvendo seu outro cavalo para a sua "casa natural". agora as pretas precisam resolver novamente o mesmo problema da rodada anterior - como defender o peão central? além de cxc (cxc="cavalo toma cavalo") e deste cc3, uma outra resposta muito boa seria colocar o peão da dama em d4. a essa altura, esse é um dos melhores lances à disposição das pretas. dentre as partidas que começam com esses lances, a minha base de dados diz que as brancas vencem 39%, as pretas vencem 30% e em 31% dos casos dá empate. ao colocar o peão em d6 as pretas finalmente providenciam uma defesa mais definitiva para o seu peão central de e5. em termos de desenvolvimento, a boa notícia é que agora um dos bispos está mais livre; a má notícia é que o outro bispo que já estava livre agora voltou a ficar preso! lance fraco! evite dar xeques a esmo. esse é um xeque facilmente defensável, e o lance pouco contribui para o desenvolvimento das peças brancas. além disso, não possui ação no centro. melhores seriam: - colocar o peão da dama em d4, ou - colocar esse bispo mais perto do centro, em c4. boa resposta. observe que, nessa configuração, se as pretas pudessem fazer um segundo lance consecutivo elas poderiam tomar o bispo com bxb - as brancas retomariam com cxb, mas aí haveria uma surpresinha desagradável: o cavalo preto tomaria o peão central das brancas, pois o segundo cavalo que apareceu para dar suporte foi "distraído" na recaptura do bispo (depois de cxe4 as brancas não podem imitar com cxe5, senão levam d6xc ("d6xc"="peão que está na casa d6 captura o cavalo"). iniciativa e vivacidade no roque! é sempre bom realizar o roque, de preferência o-o ("o-o" é o símbolo do roque pequeno. se o roque tivesse sido realizado com a outra torre, que está mais longe, o símbolo seria "o-o-o"). observe que esse roque permite que as pretas façam o estratagema descrito no movimento anterior, com bxb seguido de cxb e depois cxe4, ganhando um peão. contudo, com de2 as brancas atacam o cavalo preto, que terá de recuar para se defender. se isso tudo acontecer, mesmo com um peão a menos a posição das brancas é boa, e cedo ou tarde serão boas as chances de capturar esse peão preto da coluna "e", reequilibrando o placar. esse avanço do peão da torre para a6 deixa o bispo branco ameaçado (pois se as brancas permitirem que o bispo preto capture o bispo branco na esperança de retomar com o cavalo, perderão também o cavalo!) vamos ver o que as brancas fazem para se livrarem dessa ameaça... lance fraco. melhor seria o agressivo bxb. entenda: as brancas estão restringidas, sob ataque, e fizeram um lance passivo, meramente defensivo, o que "passa a iniciativa" para as pretas, que estão livres para tentar inventar qualquer coisa - e se houver um novo ataque, as brancas terão que se defender novamente... e após um terceiro ataque, nova defesa... com isso, as pretas "pegaram a iniciativa" e podem começar a pressionar as brancas. por outro lado... se o lance é bxb, às pretas não restará alternativa senão retomar - e qualquer que seja o modo escolhido para realizar essa retomada, a vez de jogar voltará para as brancas nenhuma ameaça - as brancas é que estarão livres para tentarem inventar alguma ameaça. sempre lute pela iniciativa! lance fraco. melhor seria bxb. embora esse avanço de peão tenha o mérito de criar uma ameaça às brancas, mantendo a iniciativa em posse do time preto, o fato é que depois que o bispo recuar para b3 as pretas não terão mais o que fazer, e com um agravante: em b3 o bispo branco dominará uma importante diagonal! aprenda: torres devem dominar colunas livres (e também fileiras), bispos devem dominar diagonais livres. as colunas livres são verdadeiras estradas asfaltadas, dando às torres ótimas condições de mobilidade. idem em relação aos bispos, que em vez de colunas preferem diagonais.  não deu outra: as brancas "agradecem" a pressão dos peões pretos, que no fim das contas não causaram nenhum prejuízo à posição das brancas e ainda por cima conduziram o bispo para uma ótima localização! aparentemente, é um bom lance, pois desenvolve o cavalo para uma "casa natural". contudo, observe que logo após as brancas posicionarem um bispo em uma ótima diagonal as pretas respondem fechando uma das rotas que estavam abertas para o seu bispo da coluna d. além disso, esse lance permite que as brancas respondam com cg5 - se nada for feito, a sequência disso seria cxf7, que além de ganhar o peão preto de f7 ainda faz um ataque duplo à dama e à torre, ou seja, ganha uma torre! melhor teria sido colocar o bispo mais atrasado em frente ao rei (be7), o que ao menos permitiria o roque. as brancas deixam escapar a oportunidade de criar as ameaças associadas ao avanço do seu cavalo da direita para a casa g5 (cg5), o que poderia permitir o letal cxf7. mas avançar o peão da dama para d3, embora um pouco passivo, não pode ser considerado um lance ruim: tem ação central, desenvolve um bispo e é bastante sólido. boa jogada, pois devolve ao bispo um pouco de liberdade. além disso, embora bispos e cavalos tenham o mesmo valor (cada um é considerado equivalente a 3 peões, sendo tradicional pensar que p=1; c=b=3; t=5; d=9), é comum considerar que "bispos sejam um pouquinho melhores do que cavalos" (na verdade, depende de cada posição - em algumas posições mais obstruídas os cavalos são melhores, pois saltam, nas posições mais abertas os bispos são melhores, pois voam rapidamente ao longo de diagonais livres, ou seja, cada caso é um caso). quem tem o par de bispos e já está sem cavalos quase sempre está melhor do que um adversário que tenha o par de cavalos e já esteja sem bispos. e essa jogada tem o mérito de permitir que as pretas sacrifiquem um cavalo para ganhar um bispo, "normalmente vale um pouquinho mais". mas vale uma última observação: cavalos têm maior potencial de ação quando estão no centro. posicionados junto à borda eles têm movimentos limitados, de modo que só vale a pena colocar os cavalos longe do centro quando existe alguma razão tática bastante evidente como não existe nenhum jeito de evitar desvantajosa troca de bispo por cavalo, as brancas tratam de cuidar de desenvolver suas peças. esse lance bg5 não é ruim, pois "crava" o cavalo - embora seja difícil aproveitar essa cravada (quando uma peça estiver pregada, tente atacá-la - nesse caso, porém, não é fácil providenciar um novo ataque - além disso, as pretas podem intercalar um bispo entre o cavalo e a dama ao jogarem be7, anulando a cravada). boa jogada! jamais ignore o incômodo fato de que uma das suas peças está pregada: sempre lute pela máxima mobilidade" (se você estivesse em um campo de batalha, o que você ia preferir: ficar preso, de mãos amarradas e dentro de um caixote, ou livre, com os braços ágeis e prontos para atacar e defender, junto com pernas livres para chutar e correr??) lance interessante: observe que a dama saiu do caminho, permitindo que as torres "se comuniquem". é sempre uma boa ideia manter as torres em comunicação, pois uma defende a outra e a outra defende a uma! além disso, em breve uma das torres poderá se posicionar atrás da dama, criando uma metralhadora ofensiva ao longo da coluna d. em todo caso, foi um lance um tanto quanto passivo, e melhor seria o agudo bxc, o que abriria de uma vez por todas as linhas defensivas das pretas (o que compensa o fato de que bispos são "um pouco melhores do que os cavalos", pois uma linha de defesa em frangalhos é bem melhor do que isso). o-o finalmente! o roque é um lance muito útil, pois deixa o rei protegido e coloca a torre em jogo. é um lance para ser feito o quanto antes, e não seria um bom sinal esperar mais do que dez lances para rocar! esse roque é um pouco tardio, e já nasce sob ameaça: com bxc as brancas podem bagunçar todas as características defensivas desse roque. bom lance: a torre se posiciona atrás da dama, dobrando o poder de ataque ao longo da coluna d.  passados 10 lances, como estamos? a posição está equilibrada. os dois reis rocaram, mas o roque das brancas está mais "inquebrável". os dois bispos brancos estão muito ativos e bem posicionados (um ameaça demolir o roque adversário e o outro domina uma importante diagonal), enquanto um dos bispos pretos está totalmente aprisionado. os cavalos brancos estão em posições "naturais", enquanto os cavalos pretos parecem um pouco inferiores (embora um deles esteja prestes a realizar uma vantajosa troca de cavalo por bispo). a disputa por espaço no centro do tabuleiro está equilibrada. a dama branca está muito mais livre do que a sua irmã preta, e as torres brancas já se comunicam e estão dobradas com a dama, algo que não se vê no lado das pretas. em todo caso, é uma posição equilibrada, e os dois jogadores chegaram até aqui sem cometerem erros graves. uma cuiriosidade: dez lances se passaram e não houve nenhuma captura! a primeira captura do jogo. lance correto das pretas, pois ganham um bispo mesmo perdendo um cavalo - além disso, dois peões brancos ficarão "dobrados" na coluna b, e isso é considerado uma fraqueza: quando dois peões estão lado a lado é impossível posicionar uma peça inimiga diante deles, mas quando estão enfileirados esse "escudo" deixa de existir. aprenda: dobrar torres é muito bom, mas dobrar peões é ruim aprenda também: peões formam uma espécie de "escudo" quando estão lado a lado, e isso é especialmente importante no caso dos 3 peões que protegem o rei após o roque. 1) os peões brancos ficaram dobrados; 2) as pretas ainda têm um par de bispos, mas as brancas não - elas têm apenas 1 bispo 3) as pretas tinham um problema: um dos seus cavalos estava mal posicionado, junto à borda. por outro lado, as brancas exibiam orgulhosamente um bispo muito bem posicionado, que dominava uma diagonal livre que desembocava direto na direção do rei inimigo - e as pretas acabam de trocar um cavalo mal localizado por um bispo bem localizado 4) as brancas não têm escolha: nem é preciso pensar... devem retomar. isso significa que a iniciativa está com as pretas. 5) as brancas escolheram o peão errado! a captura deveria ter sido feita com o peão da coluna a, pois o peão de c é mais central e estava em uma formação de 3 peões alinhados diagonalmente em direção ao centro. qual foi o objetivo desse lance? na verdade, foi um lance sem objetivo. muito passivo, e ainda por cima bloqueou os caminhos de um bispo. a posição estava um pouco "morta", sem nenhuma ameaça evidente. tampouco havia uma clara oportunidade. em momentos como esse é comum "perder a inspiração" e fazer lances fracos. mas sempre existe algo interessante! por exemplo, colocar o bispo em g4 (não seria brilhante nem letal, mas seria bom... ao menos ameaçaria bagunçar o roque das brancas por meio de bxc) ao fazer isso, provavelmente as brancas visualizaram uma troca de peões do tipo b5xa4 seguida de b3xa4 (desdobrando os peões). contudo, em casos assim é comum que o jogador não perceba que as pretas não são obrigadas a tomar o peão, podendo simplesmente avançar seu peão de b5 para a casa b4 - se fizerem isso, ameaçarão o cavalo branco, que será obrigado a fugir, abandonando a ótima casa c3 em que atualmente se encontra - e ao fazer isso, a presença branca no centro ficará menos sólida. esse avanço tirou a única defesa que sustentava o peão central preto (o peão de e5), que se encontra ameaçado por um cavalo desde o segundo lance da partida. aprenda: perder um peão é ruim; perder um peão central é péssimo. outro problema com essa jogada é que ela entrega um peão central sem nenhuma compensação. foi uma distração, uma queda no grau de concentração. aprenda: no xadrez (ou durante uma prova no colégio), depois de um certo tempo nosso grau de atenção oscila para baixo. isso é normal, mas é importante que "algum despertador interno" nos avise "ei! seu grau de concentração está baixo - espere um pouco e não faça nada enquanto a sua atenção não voltar para os níveis normais") - dessa vez, esse desertador não tocou. ótimo lance: implacáveis, as brancas aproveitam o primeiro vacilo das pretas e obtém uma importante vantagem: capturaram o peão central das pretas! as pretas passam por um mau momento na partida, e parecem um pouco assustadas com a perda do peão. é verdade que o bispo se encontrava ameaçado pelo cavalo, mas também é verdade que ele já estava protegido pela dama. com esse movimento as pretas entregam mais um peão... as brancas são inclementes e sem comiseração, punindo severamente cada lapso das pretas. zonzas como estão, não seria uma surpresa se as pretas reagissem ao ataque feito pelo cavalo à dama com o desastrado dc1 (você consegue imaginar o que as brancas poderiam fazer nesse caso? elas tomariam o bispo e ainda fariam um ataque duplo, com xeque e ameaça à dama... e quando as pretas saíssem do xeque, adeus dama preta!) as pretas despertam, e fazem um lance coerente. parece que o grau de atenção voltou ao normal. a essa altura, porém, as pretas já começam a ficar pressionadas pelo relógio, com cerca de 5 minutos a menos do que as brancas. aqui as brancas provavelmente pensaram "em vez de fazer um lance passivo que meramente defenda o cavalo, é melhor fazer algo mais agressivo, como uma troca de cavalo por bispo - que, aliás, costuma ser um bom negócio" bom lance as pretas retomam corretamente. agora é a vez das brancas realizarem um lance desprovido de significado. aprenda: como regra geral, não é bom movimentar os 3 peões que protegem o rei rocado - embora existam exceções, é claro, pois cada posição é um caso.  foi um lance pouco inspirado, as brancas deveriam ter pensado um pouco mais -- eles têm tempo para isso! (por exemplo, avançar o peão central para e5 seria ótimo, já que o cavalo está pregado - ele não pode sair de onde está, sob pena do bispo branco capturar a dama preta). a ideia de posicionar uma torre em uma coluna livre é boa, em geral. nesse caso específico, porém, a jogada não é boa, pois dá às brancas uma segunda chance de perceber que o avanço do peão central para e5 é um bom ataque... estrategicamente, essa jogada tem um defeito: entrega à torre das pretas uma coluna 100% livre. além disso, as brancas deixaram a oportunidade de atacar o cavalo pregado por meio do avanço do peão central para e4. mas a jogada possui um mérito muito positivo: o condutor das brancas percebeu que essa troca resultaria em um lucro de um peão (pois depois de cxd5 pode seguir bxc, mas quando as brancas prosseguirem com e4xb as pretas perceberão que não podem usar o cavalo em cxd5, já que isso implicaria a perda da dama). o bispo retoma... ok pronto: as brancas ganham bispo e peão em troca de um cavalo - além do lucro de mais um peão, as brancas trocaram um cavalo por um bispo, o que também é lucrativo. essa captura é uma boa forma de dar sequência à partida, pois deixa as pretas com ótimo espaço livre. ok, retomada normal. observe a posição: as pretas possuem uma significativa desvantagem material (3 peões a menos), mas suas peças estão bem mais livres: sua dama tem ótimas casas, sua torre domina uma coluna aberta e seu roque permanece intacto (embora isso não seja mérito das pretas: as brancas é que desperdiçaram várias oportunidades de desmantelar o roque preto). pesando prós e contras, é inegável que as brancas estão em vantagem, embora não seja uma vantagem tão cômoda que permita "ligar o piloto automático": ainda há muito trabalho a ser feito! péssima jogada, tanto pelo que fez quanto pelo que não fez: a torre preta dominava uma coluna aberta, e abandonou o posto para atacar um peão dobrado; deveria ter feito esse ataque com a dama (dama em d6), pois além de criar uma ameaça as pretas conseguiriam: a) despregar o cavalo; e b) posicionar a dama em uma excelente diagonal confesso que não tenho certeza se anotei corretamente esse lance: talvez a partida tenha continuado com a outra torre sendo movida para a casa e1 - que, de fato, é superior. a dama foi atacada e deve ser defendida. o lance realizado não é um erro grave, mas seria mais agressivo posicionar a dama na casa d6 (se na sequência as brancas permitissem que o cavalo preto fosse à casa g4, as brancas poderiam levar xeque mate) lance aceitável. as brancas propõem uma troca de damas. as pretas tomam o peão, e isso é correto. em vez disso, talvez fosse melhor abrir de vez a defesa das pretas, com bxc. aprenda: embora os bispo normalmente valham um pouquinho mais do que os cavalos, também existe um valor "posicional" em ver o roque adversário desmantelado. as brancas ignoraram esse fato durante esse jogo. mas tudo bem: ocupar uma coluna aberta com uma torre também tem um certo valor posicional (embora, nesse caso específico, essa coluna esteja um tanto quanto "fora da região onde as coisas acontecem") para retomar a iniciativa, teria sido interessante atacar a dama branca colocando uma torre na coluna e. além disso, esse movimento enfraquece um roque que passou vários lances sendo inacreditavelmente poupado pelo condutor das brancas - e de repente o próprio condutor das pretas causa a destruição! definitivamente, as brancas têm algum carinho especial pelo roque do rei preto... o certo (acho que escrevo isso pela décima vez aqui...) seria bxc essa perseguição do bispo branco pelos peões pretos é inútil, mas é muito comum: instintivamente, ao vermos alguém fugindo somos tomados pelo desejo selvagem de empreender uma perseguição! mas calma: xadrez é exatamente uma luta interior entre o nosso lado racional e os nossos instintos selvagens! aqui, novamente o lance correto seria ameaçar a dama deslocando uma das torres para a coluna e. se não bastassem esses problemas, existe outro: há um erro de cálculo, e esse movimento permite uma troca de peões que será lucrativa para as brancas. as brancas capturam... em vez de recapturar, você consegue adivinhar qual deveria ter sido o lance das pretas?? pois é... "ameaçar a dama deslocando uma das torres para a coluna e" (dessa vez eu copiei e colei o texto, para economizar digitação!) pronto! mais um peão se foi... a essa altura as pretas já estavam bastante pressionadas no relógio, e começam a fazer lances rápidos, sem pensar. o cavalo estava pregado! (pobre cavalo... passou boa parte da partida cravado) como aquele texto ainda está copiado, vou apenas pressionar ctrl+v: o melhor lance seria "ameaçar a dama deslocando uma das torres para a coluna e", ou, se preferir, deslocar a dama para f5. existem inúmeras formas de proteger esse cavalo, inclusive o fraco lance com com a torre em d6 (um erro mais perdoável). lá se foi uma torre... (colocar a torre em c5 também seria uma boa ideia) também poderia ter capturado o bispo com a dama. lance pouco inspirado das brancas... mas ok, a vantagem material é muito grande: 5 pontos! melhor seria cg7 (o cavalo perto do rei ficaria defendido e daria alguma proteção ao rei). esse lance permite, por exemplo, que o cavalo seja novamente atacado (por meio de mais um avanço desse mesmo peão) segue o ataque... cg4 teria sido uma fuga mais agressiva, pois atacaria a dama e posicionaria o cavalo próximo do rei branco, que está bastante exposto. as brancas começam a atacar sem muita objetividade... embora estejam azucrinando o pobre cavalo preto, o fato é que as brancas não vão muito longe com esse movimento (inclusive porque o cavalo está duplamente defendido). o cavalo preto vai se afastando cada vez mais da região da tabuleiro em que o jogo se concentra: a briga está no lado direito, e o cavalo foi parar no lado esquerdo. essa fuga foi desnecessária. as brancas deslocam a sua poderosa dama para uma casa de onde ataca duplamente o peão preto - contudo, esse peão preto está bem defendido pelo casal real, dama e rei (se txf7 segue dxf7 e se as brancas insistem com dxf7 então as pretas respondem com rxf7, e as brancas acabaram de trocar uma torre por um peão!). mas o pior mesmo é que, depois de jogar com relativa calma e segurança, as brancas cometem o pior erro que pode ser cometido: entregam a dama de graça, sem nenhuma compensação. o lance seguinte sela o desfecho da partida... as pretas não deixaram de notar que as brancas cometeram um lapso, e dessa vez são elas que atuam de modo implacável: o erro das brancas não foi perdoado.  lamentavelmente, cometi algum erro ao anotar a partida, e não sei os lances finais. as pretas não se comportaram bem a partir desse lance, pois pouco depois elas é que cometeram um lapso, entregando a dama - mas dessa vez o condutor das brancas não percebeu, e a dama preta prosseguiu viva. sem cometer novos erros, as pretas devastaram todas as peças brancas, chegando a um final de rei e dama contra rei. mas o ponteiro das pretas caiu: essa queda de seta, em tal posição, significou empate. o jogo foi bom até o 13º lance, mas a partir desse ponto os dois jogadores erraram muito. o condutor das pretas errou mais, porém o erro do condutor das brancas foi mais grave. espero que esses comentários ajudem os dois jogadores a reverem suas próprias partidas, aprenderem com os próprios erros e melhorarem seu desempenho. parabéns aos dois jogadores, foi um empate justo. a partida inaugurou muito bem o torneio afbndes de xadrez sub-18 por equipes! 
-------------------------------------
ótimo lance. deve ser o preferido de todos os iniciantes: tem ação central e libera caminhos para a dama e um bispo, além de oferecer uma casa  mais para um cavalo. uma das vantagens de liberar o caminho desse bispo é que ele deve ser movido para que o roque pequeno seja possível. ótimo, pelas mesmas razões os jogadores continuam fazendo bons lances: essa é a casa mais natural para o cavalo, ao menos no início das partidas essa é uma resposta rara, que ocorre em menos de 0,5% das vezes em que temos 1e4e5 2cf3. as estatísticas indicam que esse é um movimento ruim, pois em cerca de 70% dos casos as brancas vencem. observe que o cavalo poderá capturar o peão central das pretas. lance ruim, pois desperdiça a chance de capturar o peão central das pretas. o correto seria cxe5 melhor seria capturar o peão. esse xeque não teve muita objetividade, pois é facilmente contornado pelas brancas. boa jogada: resolve o xeque, libera uma diagonal para a dama, atua no centro e realiza um ataque contra o bispo preto. as pretas movimentaram o bispo, depois movimentaram outra vez e agora movimentaram de novo! isso viola um princípio importante: na abertura do jogo, evite usar a mesma peça mais de uma vez. boa jogada! as brancas ganham o peão (já deveriam ter feito isso, mas antes tarde do que nunca!) bom lance, desenvolvendo o cavalo para a sua melhor casa, liberando o caminho para o roque pequeno e atacando um peão branco. cc4 teria sido mais agressivo, mas o lance escolhido ao menos mostra que as brancas perceberam que seu peão estava ameaçado. lance ruim: atua sobre o centro? não! desenvolve alguma peça? não! posiciona o cavalo em uma casa boa? não! (como regra geral, cavalos não devem ficar nos cantos, a menos que exista algum motivo específico) cria alguma ameaça para o adversário? não! ok, esse lance não compromete nada grave e ainda abre espaço para o roque pequeno. contudo, se a ideia foi criar uma ameaça, esqueça: o peão em d7 conta com 4 defesas! além disso, se esse bispo se tornar incômodo poderá ser facilmente expulso, por meio de um avanço de peão até c6. péssimo lance, que revela que as pretas estão um pouco confusas e sem imaginação: primeiro colocam o cavalo em uma casa ruim, depois desperdiçam tempo fazendo-o retornar à casa inicial! aqui, muito melhor teria sido rocar. as brancas rocam. ok, é bom rocar, pois isso coloca a torre em jogo e deixa o rei menos exposto. mas veja: esse roque está fragilizado, pois um dos 3 peões que fazem a "guarda real" já foi movido. ok, esse lance tem um mérito: é agressivo, pois coloca o bispo branco em risco. no futuro, porém, dêem preferência a ataques que não possam ser tão facilmente defendidos. aqui, o bispo vai recuar sem maiores dificuldades (e se for atacado novamente pelo outro peão, continuará fugindo, e no fim das contas estará em uma boa casa!) 0 melhor teria sido rocar o bispo também poderia ter ido para a casa d3, onde ajudaria a dar uma sólida sustentação ao centro branco. mas essa jogada é interessante, pois permite um futuro bb3, de onde o bispo cominará uma importante diagonal. ok. isso é bom: os dois jogadores realizaram o roque (beleza!), mais especificamente o roque pequeno (ótimo!), e fizeram isso antes do décimo lance (boa!!) a posição está boa para as brancas, que monopolizam o centro com seus 4 peões. as pretas, porém, têm um roque mais preservado, com 3 peões protegendo o rei, além de um cavalo e uma torre por perto - o nível máximo de proteção! ok, é um lance jogável, desenvolvendo o bispo e "pregando" o cavalo - quando chegar a hora certa, esse bispo poderá forçar uma troca com o cavalo, bagunçando o roque das pretas, que está impecável. esse lance não foi bom: tira do cavalo a sua casa natural - aliás, esse cavalo está 100% aprisionado agora! cg4 seria bom. esse movimento de dama é errado por conta de um detalhe: retira a única casa de fuga que o bispo tinha - se as pretas perceberem, avançarão um peão até b5 e deixarão esse bispo em uma tremenda enrascada! as pretas desperdiçaram a chance de atacar o bispo branco, mas o lance realizado tem o mérito de ser ofensivo - realmente, devemos sempre deixar o adversário na defensiva, evitando jogadas passivas e sempre criando algum problema que complique o próximo lance do oponente. lance péssimo: as brancas capturaram um peão. mas perderão um cavalo! ok, mas seria ainda melhor capturar com o cavalo que ainda se encontra no fundo do tabuleiro, desenvolvendo-o. bom lance: possui ação central e permite que as torres se comuniquem. ok, lance normal. as pretas precisam acelerar o desenvolvimento das suas peças. provavelmente com a intenção de trocar cavalo por bispo (que normalmente é um bom negócio). esse lance foi ok. uma defesa criativa, gostei! em vez de fugir com o bispo ou providenciar alguma defesa, as pretas deram um jeito de pregar o cavalo branco: se as brancas insistirem em capturar o bispo de a5 com o cavalo, perderão a dama com bxd! contudo, um pouco mais de cálculo mostra que o lance não é bom, pois depois de trocar bispo por cavalo com bxc e g7xb as brancas poderiam avançar o peão até d5, anulando a pregadura - e assim o cavalo poderia capturar o bispo em segurança. esse cavalo está com o mal da vaca doida! jogou tudo pro alto e foi em busca do bispo, deixando a própria dama perdida! alguém aí quer um par de óculos?? as pretas não perceberam que uma dama suculenta estava pronta para ser devorada! ufa! depois de suar frio, as brancas fogem com a dama bem rapidinho... isso não foi bom... o cavalo tampou a saída do bispo: se o bispo for atacado por um peão em d5, para onde vai fugir? perdendo a chance de atacar o bispo. esse ataque à dama não surte muito efeito, pois é fácil de defender - na verdade a dama até agradece, pois ela precisava mesmo sair de onde estava, despregando o seu cavalo. correto. muito melhor seria avançar esse peão para a casa d5, atacando um bispo que não teria meios de se defender. ao jogar, fique sempre de olho nas peças adversárias "sufocadas". retomando sem maiores polêmicas ok... pouco inspirado... boa jogada. retomando com a peça certa (retomar com o cavalo pregado causaria a perda da dama). antes de fazer essa jogada teria sido melhor "preparar o terreno" com a troca bxc, pois além de bagunçar o roque, essa jogada elimina uma das defesas das pretas. por que não retomou com a dama? se fizesse isso não haveria risco de perder a dama, pois em caso de dxd as pretas responderiam com cxd (ou seja, seria uma simples troca). a ideia de atacar um cavalo pregado é boa, mas não nesse caso: agora era hora de defender o bispo! perfeito! defendendo-se passivamente torres são peças muito pesadas: embora seu jeito de se movimentar lhe dê muita força nos finais, quando várias peças já foram capturadas e existe muito espaço para circular, antes disso elas são um pouco desengonçadas, como se fossem caminhões manobrando no quintal. as brancas podem avançar um peão até c4 para atazanar um pouco essa torre... as brancas se assustam um pouco com a presença da torre e tratam de providenciar uma defesa, sem perceberem que o peão atacado já conta com uma defesa (pela dama). por outro lado, para capturar o cavalo seria necessário retirar o peão da frente, deixando a torre livre para tomar o bispo lance pouco inspirado... que dá às brancas uma chance de capturar o cavalo. a posição é bastante favorável às brancas, mas elas deixam escapar oportunidades preciosas. mais uma vez o cavalo foi poupado ok retomada simples aqui teria sido melhor dxd - as brancas teriam que perder tempo recapturando, e com isso as pretas teriam chance de salvar o cavalo, pois um dia as brancas vão acabar vendo que existe um peão prontinho para devorar um cavalo! aleluia! em vez disso, deslocar a dama em diagonal para a casa b6 teria sido mais interessante. mas tudo bem, não muda muito as coisas: as pretas estão completamente perdidas, com uma grande desvantagem material! esse foi um lance passivo. o certo seria aproveitar para causar danos ao roque adversário, por exemplo com peão x peão apesar de inferiorizadas, as pretas buscam um jogo mais agressivo, e posicionam sua dama em um posto central e avançado, embora muito exposto a ataques. o correto seria colocar a torre na casa e1, ameaçando a dama. esse foi mais um lance passivo. mais um lance desprovido de objetivo: os dois jogadores alternam lances ruins, demonstrando que ambos estão passando por um momento de queda do grau de concentração. conforme já comentei na primeira partida, nossa capacidade de permanecer atento oscila, e é normal que ocorram fases de baixa concentração. até aí tudo bem - mas é importante ser capaz de perceber "ôpa, estou meio desatento... deixa eu contar até dez e recobrar a linha de raciocínio, e enquanto estou zonzo não vou fazer nada!!" bom lance ok as brancas voltam a realizar lances a esmo, sem objetividade. a pressão do relógio às vezes causa esse tipo de desatenção. boa! as pretas atacam o bispo branco lance fraco: as brancas entregam o bispo, que será tomado pelo peão. bye bye bispo... a vantagem das brancas se reduz um pouco. ok, certo. ok, sem maiores problemas... ok, bom lance. ok, certo bom lance! as brancas estão com um forte ataque sobre o rei preto! não!!! péssimo lance! as brancas tinham a intenção de preparar a torre para um avanço até d7, encurralando de vez o rei preto... porém, não perceberam que poderiam receber um ataque duplo, com a dama preta dando xeque e ao mesmo tempo atacando uma torre indefesa. perfeito único lance possível, pois não sobrou nenhum outro meio de escapar desse xeque. horrível! por que a dama preta não capturou a torre branca? pior do que isso: agora as brancas poderão realizar aquele plano de deslocar a torre para a casa d7 em vez de td7+, as brancas preferem atacar a dama... certo! certo! nosso cérebro às vezes se enrola quando precisa prestar atenção em duas coisas ao mesmo tempo. aqui existem dois assuntos para o condutor das pretas resolver: como atacar o rei branco e como preservar a segurança das suas peças. ao jogar, parece claro que o cérebro só se ocupou da primeira questão, e providenciou um ataque... desprezando completamente a segurança das suas peças! se a cada jogada ele tivesse o hábito de se perguntar "será que com esse lance eu vou perder a minha dama?", com certeza não teria feito isso... bye bye dama. o xeque mate é iminente... ok, jogável melhor teria sido recuar a torre... se bem que não existe lance que salve a partida das pretas: a única esperança é que as brancas errem. bom lance. a esperança é a última que morre: e se as brancas erram? o jogo foi bom, mas com muitos momentos de passividade e de jogadas sem objetividade. cada vez que temos o lance devemos tentar das duas uma: ou criar uma ameaça ou melhorar o posicionamento de alguma peça. caso estejamos sob ataque, devemos pensar com calma para encontrar uma forma de defesa que seja sólida e não piore muito a posição das nossas peças. nesse jogo as brancas deixaram que a sua vantagem se reduzisse a apenas 3 peões a mais, e se não fosse a perda da dama por mera falta de atenção poderia haver certa dificuldade de jogar o final.

joguei 12...db6 com intenção de 13...cg4 e pressionar o peão atrasado dele de e3, geraldo responde corretamente 13.h3! geraldo joga 14.ch4, com intenção de 15.txf6 gxf6 16.cf5 e finalmente 17.dg3 com ameaça de mate! respondi 14...ch5  cometi um descuido nesse lance, mas em troca do peão, obtive 1 tempo na construção do meu ataque aos peões centrais brancos! joguei 18...da6 com intenção de 19...b5 20.bb3 bxb3 21.cxb3 e finalmente 21...dxd3 recuperando o peão, mas geraldo responde 19.d4 evitando a perda do peão e ao mesmo tempo contratacando o meu peão central preto. joguei 19...tae8 como movimento defensivo ja prevendo o avanço de d5 por parte das brancas!  contra-atacando o bispo dele, na intenção de trocar meu bispo mais ou menos pelo bispo bom dele, mas ele recusa avanço providencial evitando 24.e4 e defendendo o peão passado branco xeque providencial para evitar o avanço do peão passado lance para pressionar o peão passado dele 26...f6 único pois a sequencia de trocas favorecia as brancas geraldo busca expulsar meu cavalo de g6, nesse momento eu estava calculando um contra jogo após as trocas que viriam a seguir após esse lance, fui forçado a tomar a torre de dama, devido ao lance branco 33.dg4, causando sérios problemas na posição para as negras lance previsível que ja tinha visto desde o lance 31.h5 final equilibrado, onde um erro é fatal ameaço a torre na intenção de desenvolver rapidamente os meus cavalos para atacar o rei branco nova ameaça, entregando o peão mas desenvolvendo o cavalo 40...td4! lance lógico que é atacante e defensivo ao mesmo tempo após 41.ce6, eu poderia simplesmente tomar o peão com 41...td6, geraldo responderia 42.txg7+ rh8 43.tg6 th4+ 44.rg1 txh5 e ficaria empatado tecnicamente, mas eu queria ir alem, foi pura estratégia da minha parte, já estava calculando possibilidade de mate! seguiu 41.td1+  meu calculo estava tão imprevisível que esqueci da possibilidade do perpetuo de cavalo, por sorte geraldo não viu tambem, eu fui ver após o lance 43.cf8+ posição de perpétuo, bastava geraldo jogar cg6+, depois cf8+, repetindo, se fosse moacir com certeza iria empatar kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk! após esse lance continuei com a minha combinação, esperando só mais um erro da parte de geraldo mate quase pronto, ou geraldo perpetua ou ele leva mate! ele acabou jogando 45.ta8, ameaçando promover e da mate com bispo em g6 e descoberto de cavalo, mas meu mate ja estava pronto. posição de problema: pretas jogam e dão mate em 3 lances! após esse lance geraldo abandona, mas vamos seguir para ver como iria terminar a partida! mate muito bonito, com 2 cavalos e uma torre, partida digna de gms. um abraço!

se plantea la lucha por el centro, concretamente por la casilla d4. julio granda dice que las negras han salido bien de la apertura. no obstante, las negras se están quedando cortas de tiempo. sta jugada no le gustó a william moreno: el negro pierde un peón y, encima, abre la posición. de todos modos, a esta altura varios aficionados especulaban con un empate, dado los alfiles de diferente color. buena jugada ! pero los alfiles de diferente color permiten, precisamente, los ataques en el medio juego. y eso hace julio, apurar las acciones contra el rey negro. fallaba el ataque a la torre: 38... bd4?, por 39.qc8+ rg8 40.g7+ bxg7 41.qf5 y mate. buena jugada ! granda señala que contra 43... be5, tenía 44.rg3!! se amenazaba 45.rxh6+ bxh6 46.qh7#. rinden mate invitable.

-------------------------------------
se trata del segundo round del torneo de la unam en mi categoría, menor de 1600. en estos momentos abrí con gambito de dama, veía que había muchos novatos y con gambito de dama se descubriría con alguna jugada inesperada. la partida se ha desarrollado como un gambito de dama declinado, en su línea principal con ag5. las negras pueden responder con cbd7, c5, o c6. todo esto es teórico, realmente no hay nada nuevo.  esto me parece un error, la jugada principal es 0-0 siguiendo la lógica de las jugadas anteriores (g6, ag7, cf6) estuve pensando largo rato esta jugada, pero me pareció apropiada...aún no conocía la fuerza ajedrecistica de mi rival  fritz recomienda da5, con cierta posibilidad de igualdad a lo largo del juego en estos momentos, decidí seguir con la teoría y que la posición de las negras se derrumbara por si sola de nueva cuenta me sumí a pensar si era correcto, por la posibilidad de da5 y como dije, fritz iguala la posición porque de hecho es una mala jugada c5. pero con tan pocas jugadas, me pareció que mi contrincante no tenía tanta experiencia y que se "sofocaría" ante la presión de peones ha perdido 2 tiempos la única posibilidad de contrajuego de las negras todavía no estoy seguro si esta es una buena o mala jugada, por la posibilidad de contrajuego de las negras. tuve que calcular hasta la jugada 20 más o menos y otras variantes, fue un poco extenuante para mi nivel de aficionado. pero finalmente decidí hacerla me parece que era la mejor jugada de las negras, se sumió en unos 15 minutos de reflexión. ya la había calculado pero tuve que calcularla de nuevo...y es que como pueden ver sigue dxh3, luego ag4, y probabilidades de mate sin duda fue la peor jugada, debi haber esperado.  era evidente la amenaza ag4, la única jugada que concebí como buena fue esta. para seguir con ce1 una buena compensación de las negras por la pieza menor.  mi única posibilidad es el intercambio de piezas para hacer más notoria la pieza menor faltante de las negras una jugada deliberada, si 26. axf1 sigue 27. cf6+, txf6, 28. txe8+, rg7, 29. rxf1...y luego de ce3-cd5, la torre esta perdida. se sigue amenazando la misma táctica aprovechando el error del negro, la única era 28. de4, pero no le gustó la posibilidad de perder la pareja de torres con cf6+ he de admitir que para este momento, me sentí aliviado del craso error cometido y jugué bastante confiado en los siguientes minutos aquí tuve que hacer un paréntesis, después de tomar dxd3 fui a comer. casualmente me encontré con manuel fuentes, y comentando la partida le dije que mi siguiente jugada en caso de dg3+ era tg2, pues es la que estaba calculando mentalmente. y manuel me hizo ver mi error porque obviamente sigue dxe1. sin embargo, eran cálculos sin tablero y por las prisas había calculado mal, afortunadamente cuando regresé y vi dg3+, me detuve a pensar mejor. en estos torneos nunca es sano jugar a la ligera. mi única posibilidad era llevar mi rey al flanco dama un grave error, finalmente mi rival sucumbió a la presión. llevábamos más de 2 hrs sentados pensando. ya estaba muy difícil para las negras. necesitaban un craso error de mi parte una jugada fea, no es recomendable las negras se apacigüan, no queda de otra que jugar a la defensiva está clara la amenaza el golpe final táctico que inició con db3 era cuestión de tiempo para que las negras sucumbieran y con golpes tácticos es más rápido. al final, el muchacho, sumamente molesto me dijo fríamente "ps felicidades". yo no respondí, sin embargo me parecen absurdas esa clase de comportamientos antideportivos. pero seguía una tercera ronda, y estaba seguro que sería más complicado. 
-------------------------------------
esta es mi tercera partida, yuri un joven oaxaqueño de 19 años, representante en las olimpiadas. un rival fuerte. me sentí bastante cómodo al jugar la defensa francesa, como bien saben, la prefiero por sus posiciones tácticas debo admitir que me sorprendió mucho esta apertura, después la investigué un poco y averigüe que el gm carlsen magnus, la acostumbraba jugar. es la apertura stonewall. supongo que por ese motivo se ha vuelto popular entre los más jóvenes ajedrecistas. como dije me sorprendió bastante y decidí adelantar c5, aprovechando su punto debil d4. pretendía basar todo mi juego en el control de esta casilla pidiendo explicaciones al peón de e4, me sentía bastante cómodo en esta posición creo que subestimando a mi rival, y a su posición pasiva decidi jugar g6, pero creo que era más fuerte d4, con el posterior e5, apoyado por el cc6. aunque no me gustaba del todo la idea porque podría venir un ataque fortísimo en el ala de rey. por esa razón y aprovechando mi ventaja posicional decidi continuar con la idea original y controlar la casilla d4 no recuerdo bien que gm dijo "en una apertura donde no sepas bien por donde van los cauces, aconsejo fianchetto". y me pareció buena idea, controlaba de lejos el centro y me limitaba a observar que se traía entre manos mi rival desafortunadamente por la posición similar, y debido a que mi supuesta ventaja no era tal....y que era una posición igualada, me desanimé al percibir unas tablas me pareció una buena jugada, pretende llevar su caballo a f1 y moverlo a e3, seguir con avance en e5 y con un ag5, la posición blanca estaría destrabada ya quería cerrar el centro al ver lo que pretendía hacer esta jugada me parece mala, creo que era mejor cf1, luego cg5 y seguir con f4. en la posición negra, ya sea en siciliana o francesa, hay una línea que debe ser seguida para darle continuidad a todas las jugadas y darle la mayor actividad posible. en este caso puede ser db6, da5, dc7, de hecho ibm al configurar deep blue recomendaba esta jugada en la computadora que debía hacerse siempre por parte de las negras, dc7. sigue con su plan de ag5, y e5 me siento bastante cómodo en esta posición, mis piezas se desarrollan con cierta naturalidad y las blancas tienen un poco de dificultad en desarrollar una estrategia me sorprendió un poco esta jugada, pero me percaté que realmente planeaba f4 como antes había supuesto. finalmente encontró que esas maniobras eran mejores. así que decidí debilitar mi enroque con tal de que f4 no fuese hecha.  quiere liberar a su alfil mediante e5, la consiguiente toma ed y retirar su alfil a e3. creo que teniendo una ventaja posicional en estos momentos, decidí abrir el juego es posible que mi contrincante no le gustara la posibilidad de cambiar alfil por caballo, pero no tenía muchas opciones y a mí me parece que era su mejor opción desarrollo ante todo algo de contrajuego, pero resulta inútil. quizás en una partida rápida hubiese funcionado, pero se trataba de un juego de más de dos horas es imposible un error de esa magnitud esta jugada me gustó mucho, amenaza romper la cadena debil de peones con f4. mantiene al caballo a raya y también manejo la posibilidad de e4, además de que he activado indirectamente la tf8 como ya les había comentado, tomar piezas es un error si dejas posicionado a una pieza menor de tu rival. sin embargo la decisión que tome con cd4 no fue la mejor, me parece mejor ce7. y es que el cambio de piezas beneficia a mi rival, desahoga sus piezas. es una pena porque de nueva cuenta estoy perdiendo mi ventaja posicional este estilo de juego me gusta mucho, presionarlos hasta la locura con peones. es un juego agresivo, y basta un error para que la agresividad te rebote en la cara el cambio le favorece al blanco, sin embargo es un alfil que debe ser eliminado. está muy bien posicionado y amenaza h5. cuando movió esta pieza, me percaté de cuales eran las verdaderas intenciones de mi rival. quería tablas. de hecho, después de que tomé su dama, me las ofreció "te ofrezco tablas", me dijo. ambos habíamos consumido mucho tiempo, cerca de 45 minutos. ya decía yo que no debería confiarme en la mañosa e3, que por su simpleza, es bastante fácil de jugar por las blancas de hecho, aquí estuve pensando un buen rato. estuve calculando algunas variantes, estaba un poco molesto lo admito de tener ahora que defender mi peón débil de e5. todo parecía indicar un triste final de tablas forzando b3, debilitando un poco los peones realmente buscaba esto, mantener la iniciativa. aquí mi rival, se sintió un poco ofuscado por esta jugada. la desesperación empezaba a mellar. habíamos estado cerca de 2 horas sentados, uno frente al otro calculando, esperando no cometer algún error era mejor td8 ahora todas las piezas están apuntando mi debilidad en e5, un peón que caerá irrremediablemente. viendo que no había posibilidad de salvación, decidí por mantenerme activo he capturado este peligrosisimo peón y finalmente, llevo un peón de menos. pero entonces, con menos de media hora calculé algunas variantes y decidí jugar a la defensiva. necesitaba ocupar td4, para amenazar alfil, recuperar peón y si torre blanca captura b6, txg3 y ad4+ con alfil de ventaja. esta fue una variante, de algunas...y para mi fortuna, mi rival no la había calculado de hecho me sorprendió un poco que ya con menos de 20 minutos estuviese jugando ya sin darle importancia...de nueva cuenta me ofreció tablas. las rechace la jugada que esperaba del blanco recupero el peón y la posibilidad de hacer una pequeña táctica si el blanco se equivoca.... aquí me sumí de nueva cuenta al cálculo, a pesar de que todo esto ya lo había calculado me sorprendió que con 15 minutos ambos, se hubiese equivocado de esa manera. sospeche y calcule por 30 segundos, al ver que no había problema decidí seguir con el plan. ya había calculado que pasaría si tomase, si no tomase, etc. estaba tan concentrado que francamente no me había percatado que eramos de los últimos en seguir jugando, había sido una partida demasiado cansada y  comencé a notar que algunos curiosos comenzaban a ver la partida...y entonces volteé a ver a mi rival, había escuchado gimoteos desde que tomé el alfil, pero me sorprendí de nueva cuenta al ver que mi rival se deshacía en llanto abierto. creo que la tensión del juego le pegó demasiado, ambos pusimos demasiada concentración y sólo bastó una jugada imprecisa para voltear la situación radicalmente.  lejos de sentirme indignado o burlón, empecé a sentir respeto por este joven que con tanta pasión lloraba por un juego de ajedrez. me parece que nunca lloraría por una partida perdida, me parece que hay cosas más importantes en mi vida. mientras los curiosos observaban al joven, y murmuraban, yo sólo guarde silencio y volteé mi mirada al juego. sin embargo, el joven había perdido por completo la concentración, era cuestión de tiempo para que se equivocara. entonces, me dio la mano, me firmó la hoja, se levantó y se fue. sentí deseos de darle una palmada en el hombro, y decirle que admiraba su pasión por este juego. pero cuando un hombre llora, realmente no hay que hacer nada. todos pasamos por eso y es parte de la madurez. luego, me lo volví a encontrar en la 6ta ronda y me felicitó por mi desempeño y yo también le deseé suerte. 
-------------------------------------
les presento mi primera partida de la unam, admito estar sumamente nervioso, me temblaban las manos y estaba taquicárdico. mi sistema límbico estaba gritando, pero decidí sentarme y hacer ejercicios de relajación, es decir, respirar profundamente. desde este momento, noté cierta confusión de mi contricante quien la manifestó sacudiendo la cabeza de un lado para otro, negando y como quien deduce que el rival (yo) ha hecho una jugada mala. decidió jugar cf3. decidí seguir con lo planeado, defensa francesa y esperar que me tenían preparado. nunca hay que confiarse, y quise jugar a la espera de la fuerza ajedrecistica de mi contrincante es muy molesto el ag4, me pareció una buena maniobra para desconcertar aún más a mi rival y tomar de cierta manera, la iniciativa. demasiado pasiva, pero sostenible, de hecho no es una jugada mala. sin embargo le da demasiado importancia a un alfil que no la tiene. en estos momentos decido desarrollar y enrocarme, pues aún no sabía contra que clase de rival me enfrentaría esta jugada es fea, me parece que pierdo un tiempo para realizar af5. sin embargo, el blanco ha frenado su desarrollo y ha debilitado el flanco de rey. supongo que es una buena justificación de nueva cuenta, me parece que persigue a un alfil que no tiene mucha importancia y la nueva posición de mi alfil, me gusta aún más quizás es un poco apresurado, pero me pareció apropiado seguir con la iniciativa me parece mejor dc, y 0-0 es de todos conocido que capturar una pieza retrasa y acomoda a las piezas menores esto ya me pareció un error ahora debe jugar af1 y eventualmente amenazar al caballo negro grave error, sin embargo en este punto ya considere jugar agresivamente debido a la inexperiencia de mi rival una jugada agresiva pero peligrosa, mi rival estaba cayendo a menos de una hora de tiempo y comenzaba a impacientarse es probable que haya sido mejor cxc1 y amenazar la torre en f1 que era la idea original en este momento ya estaba impaciente y quería que la partida terminara rápido, no quería desgastarme tanto al tener ventaja considerable y decidí hacer cambios. creo que esto fue un error de mi parte, era mejor 0-0 el blanco juega sin ninguna estrategia planeada como dije, los cambios me favorecen pero le deba algo de contrajuego al blanco la jugué porque me pareció que mi rival tardaría en hallar la jugada ce3 y así fue, en estos momentos ella tenía menos de 30 minutos y yo, poco más de una hora. es obvia la amenaza cf3+ no quería dejar nada a la deriva la teoría sugiere amenazar la pieza sin defender en estos casos debo admitir que esta jugada me sorprendió, un poco porque mi contrincante la jugó después de consumir casi 10 minutos y francamente no la esperaba. sin embargo, el caballo ha quedado atrapado y es cuestión de tiempo para que sea capturado pretende algo de contrajuego me parece que pretendía f4-f5  con 15 minutos para jugar, mi rival se desesperó que cometió este otro grave error. en estos momentos no entendía porque quería seguir jugando con tanta desventaja y con tan poco tiempo hago el paréntesis que para estos momentos mi rival, una mujer de tal vez 17 años carecía de tiempo y no jugaba ya con precisión, ni concentración un tremendo error garrafal con desventaja de 13 puntos, finalmente se rindió. 
-------------------------------------
christian juega un orden especial, sin sacar el caballo de f6; así que insto a las negras a "volver a la normalidad" ahí estamos, la receta de tigrán petrosián puesta en marcha. había leído con ahínco sus recomendaciones y ya era hora de ponerlo en práctica segunda fase, las blancas retrasan el enroque buscando el cambio en "e5" para tomar con "d4" y así sacar al caballo de f6, el gran defensor del enroque. esta es una de las posibilidades mostradas por petrosián, aunque en otro orden de jugadas ahí está. las blancas no cambian el alfil de casillas negras, manteniendo en parte el atochamiento de piezas. así es, sin abrir la columna "c" tercera fase, ahora hay que llevar las piezas al flanco, aprovechando la gran diagonal blanca (del ad3)  hay que cuidar a este alfil ahora con el enroque debilitado, comienza el avance de la estructura de peones las negras van muy lento en el flanco de dama ¡más piezas en el ataque! ¡ahora la columna "g" está abierta! sacrificio completamente justificado, las blancas ganarán si las negras toman en "b2" sin apuro, la falta de contrajuego en el centro y la cantidad de piezas asegura un mal pasar a las negras el tiempo que necesitaba con mate en pocas jugadas. 
-------------------------------------
uno de los más difíciles problemas de la teoría del ajedrez. las negras permitieron la formación de un fuerte centro de peones blancaso, pero logran ejercer una presión de piezas sobre las casillas centrales. según smyslov, tal estrategia "no es de fácil manejo, pero abre amplias perspectivas para el espíritu creador de cuantos buscan la lucha en el tablero desde aquí la dama puede trasladarse a la fuerte posición "b4" si 15 a5, sigue ab2;16 tb1, ca4 y las negras tienen una posición activa smyslov indicó que aquí las blancas debían seguir con 18 cd4, lo que hubiera conducido a un juego complejo con probabilidades aproximadamente iguales más seguro sería 19 ad1 en sus instructivos comentarios a esta partida, smyslov escribe: "decisión sencilla en apariencia, pero que en realidad implica una cuestión de principio. no cabe duda de euwe tenía en cuenta esta contestación, pero esperaba, gracias a la pareja de alfiles, recuperar el peón b6 y obtener un final favorable ¡cómo prevalece en nuestros días la convicción de la superioridad de los dos alfiles! es interesante mencionar que a chigorin le gustaba luchar llevando dos alfiles y que más de una vez lo hizo con éxito" ganar el peón de "b3" no resulta tan fácil. si 23 ab5, smyslov da la siguiente variante: 23..., ce5; 24 ac5, tc5; 25 tb3 , cf3; 26 re3, tc3! con ventaja para las negras era mejor ac3 fracaso del dogmático punto de vista sobre la "siempre fuerte" pareja de alfiles. resignándose a este cambio, las blancas admiten el error de su concepto estratégico la situación de las blancas es ya desesperada. la jugada del texto da pie a un hermosa combinación final de smyslov o bien 37 aa2, cc3; 38 re3, ta4; 39 ab3, ta3 y las negras ganan pieza las blancas abandonan 
-------------------------------------
hi all. here is one of my games that i lost recently. my opponent is a 2100+ national elo player and it's a 45min+10sec tournament.  1. e4 c5 i come here to say that this is all for all.. i'll play sicilian defense and i'm here to win! closed sicilian.. in some way i really didn't expect this movement.  sicilian kan defense fianchetto? really? well, surely i didn't expect that movement. from now on i play myself, i mean, without knowing the theory or main line in this position. something i know here, it's a good plan to play e5, so his white bishop can't play well because of his own pawn on e4. nc6 controling d4 and e5 chess is played developing pieces.. i don't want to make more pawn moves until see how white develops, plus knights must play through the center. ok.. i really hate this. my opponent plays e4 and now i feel that i'm playing a closed opening (it doesn't looks like a common e4 opening). now white has showed his plan: king side castle, and an attack to the king side (i know this because of the pawn chain structure). but this position has something peculiar.. the f2 bishop. that piece covers somehow d5 and attacks the queen side. now i have to decide how i'm going to play, what will be my plan. not decided to do d5 before putting my king on safe, i develop my bishop. the common battery of qc7 and bd6 to pressure h6 in some sicilian games clearly doesn't make any sense in this position, and a fianchetto in the king side is a little bit slow, i want to gain some space, or at least put my king on safe to start measures in centre.  f4!? an interesting move that i allowed playing be7 instead of d5, white has seen that he can gain space and attach the king side, putting pressure in e5 and f5. d6!. almost any other move is bad here, i know as a sicilian player that i can not allow e5 advance in this position. castling? not any more with f4. as white has hurried to pressure the king side, now i hurry to queen side attack, meanwhile i speculate with the castle.. maybe i'm going to king side castle, or maybe queen side, or maybe i'm going to leave the king in the centre! ..  qc7, a normal sicilian develop for the queen. qb6 is other interesting option here, as h5!? could be (an attack with the white bishop on b7, h5, ng4, h4, is very common to see in gm as karpov in this kind of positions. well, white wants all. he wants to play his c pawn to put more pressure in the center (good idea because of black's king) b5! i still have some time meanwhile white is organizing his attack., and i don't want to die because i don't have enough space to move my pieces. h3, preventing the uncomfortable ng4 finally i decide the future of the game.. i know that white will mount an attack in the king side, while i plan to queen-side attack, maybe mixing my attack with some center attack. i do this because i know his knights and pawn structure in the king side are not well positioned, so i should be able to survive his attack, and in some point i hope my attack will be faster than his (i'm counting that in this king of attacks, as white throws his king pawns, the king is exposed to many checks). bb7?!, maybe it's a mistake here. f5! and ng3 are good moves for white, as he is first in the attack. also the bishop on c8 somehow help in the defend of the king. a3? surely ng3 or f5 where better for white here. well, white haven't played f5 before, now i'm sick of waiting, plus i have almost all my pieces develop, so it's time to take active measures, and what is more active than a punch in the center? white is happy closing the position, as he knows that if he can reach h5 and g5 with pawns, supported with the pieces he has right now, the pressure over h7, g7 will be deadly mortal. time to exchange a passive knight for one of his own. here i'm aiming to many things: 1) if white doesn't take my knight, well it is a huge knight over there. it makes pressure over almost all the white side, plus i can always exchange it for his f3 knight which is the most active one white has. 2) i want the a8-a1 diagonal free for my white bishop 3) i'm aiming to have the c-row open to use it with my rooks. as i said, i want my pieces active!, so lets free the diagonal for my white bishop.  scare? no!.. i'm still calm as i know white have troubles in his c-row, and if i'm able to enter i will have a very expose king. also i'm very proud of my defense abilities, so i'm counting that i will survive to his attack. here f6 for white seems to be the move, that's why i played bd8.. after the game, and with a computer analysis, it gives be7 the best one.. seems that the computer can survive to anything with tactic.. after that, in my next games i surely will analyse be7-f7-bd5 (now i like it, because even when white is the one attacking in the king side, it's a premature attack, without enough piece force.. i need to be more brave ;) f6. not the best move, but i didn't want to think all the troubles that could involve the position if white do f6 first.. as my style of chess, i thought i would prefer to defend this position than the other one (after the computer analysis, the other position was much more easy to play as black.. damn!, why i'm so thought-lazy?) do you guys feel uncomfortable with black?.. well, i must tell that the computer analysis says that black has been up in score almost all the match ;)  qc6. i missed the better one, qc4! (really?, exchange?.. yes!, without queens black can laugh of the white attack, and the c2-pawn weakness will be more workable. now i'm happy.. i have almost all what i want!  careful with ne6! here i wanted to threat the queen and pass my rook to c4 and bring the other rook to c8.. still qc4 were better, and maybe other move. rc6. i thought it was better to c6 instead of c4 because it could protect the king side as well. second mistake. i wanted to play rc8, but now ne6 makes a lot of pressure in g7, plus other important squares like f8, d8 and c7 (where i wanted to put my queen), so i tried to protect the spot. at first i didn't realize why white did this move.. preparing rfc8 pressure over g7! bringing back the queen first, then the rook to c8. also qc7 helps to defend on the 7° row. bd3! now i see why the bishop to f1. damn!, now it's really difficult  for black to attack the c-pawn, and white can proceed with his attack. a very good move!  i'm a little bit confused over here. i've lost my plans, so meanwhile i want to prepare the defenses (i want to play qe7) the good spot for the queen. it makes black to move h6 or play bxg5.  really?, a pawn move? weren't better bxg5? what is thinking black here?. well, when i moved qe7 of course i knew white will play qh5, so i calculated h6 first, as bxg5 allowed white to take with h-pawn or with the rook, in both cases putting a lot of pressure in h-pawn. while i was analyzing this move (h6), i saw a counter attack, that surely exist (here exist a lot of moves, black can always sacrifice his white bishop on f5 to do e4 and go with checks and pressure over the white king or having activity, for example (one of many).  what?!, wait, and the h-pawn? i know!!!   bd7 was the best move i saw!, i know i'm going to lose the h pawn, but i have counter attack! really believe me! bd7 is necessary to play be8 later.  wow, open all! i really have steel nerves sometimes.. and as you will see, sometimes i lost all my thoughts and loose in one move t.t what the hell??? that was the right move, but in different order!! first i was going to move be8, expeling his queen, and then rh6, giving black a good counter attack (playing this was the first option for rybka engine!, even better than bxng5, giving black advantage of 0,6 pawns!). but i lost my mind because of people pressure (at this time, all the players were standing up from their chairs, and i got nervous, and made my move without thinking.. i had 18 min. left on my clock and my opponent only 3:30 mins, so surely was an stupid mistake not to use wisely my time and think). loosing my rook, i have nothing else to do here. i stopped the annotation and last like 6 moves more, but white took advantage of his rook, and devastate my position. a good game that i won't forget (i was really pissed off with myself). :(

une partie avec des hauts et des bas, des erreurs, un débusquage comme à la chasse à courre! 
-------------------------------------
 on part! comment une telle erreur est-elle possible? j'avais décidé de prendre le pion (avec le pion évidemment) et à la dernière minute je me suis dit : et si je prenais avec le cavalier, ce serait la même chose. et de prendre sans réflléchir. conclusion : il faut toujours bien réfléchir avant de jouer (c'est comme une vérité de la palice, mais c'est vrai). habituellement, je fais le vide sur mes réflexions avant de jouer, question de vérifier s'il n'y a pas quelque chose d'évident que j'ai manqué. mais, visiblement, je ne l'ai pas fait sur ce coup. évidemment! mon adversaire avait abandonné quelques jours auparavant dans une autre partie, aussitôt qu'il allait perdre une pièce (pas vrai, nicolas ?). je me suis dit que je le chicanerais pour son manque de ténacité. donc, pas question que j'abandonne. tout à coup il jouerait qxq ? les fous blancs sont très bien placés, donc il y a peut-être de l'espoir. excellent. comment continuer? les blancs doivent tenter de garder une certaine pression. pas beaucoup de choix. ici, je ne comprends pas pourquoi les noirs ne jouent pas nc4. le pion e7 n'est pas très important en vue de l'échange d'un des fous blancs et la possibilité de sortir une tour avec gain de tempo. un coup qui ne m'a presque pas pris de temps de réflexion. dans une position de désavantage, l'activité des pièces blanches est ce qui compte le plus. donc, tant pis pour le pion c. les noirs auraient-ils été mieux de ne pas prendre? mai après tout, un pion est un pion. le problème avec ce coup c'est qu'il permet aux blancs de placer sa dame à un endroit plus favorable. l'erreur qui justifie les blancs d'avoir continué. il fallait jouer le cavalier pour laisser la case d6 au fou. ba3 était meilleur en raison de ce qui suit. ici, ma première réflexion fut : mon adversaire perd les pédales. pourquoi sacrifier sa dame pour une tour. bien sur, il perd une pièce autrement, mais n'est-ce pas mieux qu'une tour pour la dame? mais j'ai changé de réflexion plus tard. personnellement, j'aurais tenté de conserver les deux fous avec les blancs, mais c'est une considération purement théorique. ici encore, il me semble que les noirs auraient du éviter les échanges. mais ça aussi. c'est de la théorie. pourquoi avancer ce pion? dans ce type de fin de partie, si on peut parler de fin de partie déjà, l'avantage de la dame est sa mobilité et sa capacité d'attaquer le roi adverse de tous bords et tous côtés. mais pour cela, il faut que le roi adverse soit attaquable de tous bords et tous côtés. il faut donc le débusquer de dans son petit coin tranquille. ici (encore la satanée théorie), je ne comprenais pas la stratégie de mon adversaire. les tours appartiennent sur les colonnes ouvertes. ici mon adversaire semble faire fi de ce principe. je me dis : victoire facile à l'horizon. mais plus je regarde la position plus la victoire semble difficile. finalement, toute la stratégie des noirs me semble pas si mauvaise. et tant pis pour la théorie. mais je suis encore confiant de l'emporter. ce coup fait partie de mon plan de débusquage. oups! changement de plan. je craignais au plus haut point c5, la suite logique, il me semble, des derniers coups noirs. je crois toujours que c'est le coup qui aurait pu sauver les noirs, puisqu'il permet aux tours noirs d'entrer avec force dans le jeu. surtout que le coup précédent devient une perte de temps. le temps est important aux échecs. la suite du débusquage. pratiquement forcé. et le chasseur continue... encore forcé changement de plan? non, suite du débusquage. le roi noir est maintenant plus exposé. naturellement de retour au centre. ma stratégie est d'échanger une paire de tours. dans cette position, il sera impossible pour les noirs de l'empêcher. dame contre tour et cavalier, avec le roi noir maintenant plus vulnérable, et la victoire est possible. va dans le sens du plan des blancs, mais il est difficile de suggérer un meilleur coup. si les noirs ne font rien, pour éviter un échange de tours, les pions blanc vont continuer d'avancer de côté roi, et le débusquage va continuer. toujours dans le suite du plan. je crois que c'est le meilleur coup. ici, par contre, les noirs auraient du prendre le pion. mais c'est plus une intuition plus qu'une certitude. tentative louable de pouvoir jouer ensuite nc4 et éviter l'échange de tours. easy does it! (pardonnez le changement de langue, mais c'est ce que je me suis dit). aussi bien crever l'abcès, se disent les noirs. nc4 ne fonctionne pas (rxn tout simplement, et la dame peut se sacrifier pour les 2 tours noires). le coup clé qui justifie le 35ème coup des blancs. le noirs vont devoir donner échec avec le cavalier en d4 au lieu de c3 (si la dame blanche avait pris le pion). le cavalier en d4 bloque la tour, et, malgré les apparences, ne pourra pas prendre le pion en b3. non!!! j'ai bien dit que le cavalier ne pouvait pas prendre le pion. tous le coups possibles ne peuvent empêcher la capture du cavalier. même kf7 (qf6  suivi de qe6 ) mi ni mi ni ma ni mo! je prends celui-là. j'attendais plutôt rf3  mais la partie est tout de même terminée. on peut retenir deux leçons de cette partie (à part le fait de réfléchir avant de jouer et de ne pas abandonner trop tôt) : il ne faut pas toujours se fier à la théorie (le sacrifice de la dame noire n'était pas si bête); les coups de tour des noirs sur la colonne c auraient pu les sauver, s'ils avaient continué avec la poussée du pion. à part ça, c'est tout de même un bon exemple de ce que la dame peut faire contre tour et pièce mineure. la dame va habituellement l'emporter grâce à sa mobilité, et avec l'aide du roi adverse si celui-ci est vulnérable. 
-------------------------------------
he's letting me gain centre control maybe to launch a side attack later  he opts for ne2 rather than nf3...  i continue  doesnt want me pinning his knight  backing up the centre pawns  unusual fiancetto coming up?  i'd never encountered this type before except in our previous game (this was a rematch where i won the first). i don't always play like this but it seemed appropriate  there's the fiancetto...has anyone else seen this played? castling early  i was enjoying this game  getting the pawns out  getting ready for fiancetto 2.0 .. ;) that moment where there's nowhere else to go cuz all the pieces have been developed.. he is all for symmetry.. the purpose of me pulling back the knight  he chooses to castle  time to reinforce + launch an attack k-side he notices... i haven't finished yet! compromising my own k- side for a good offense  he fights back but im not sure about this move being a good idea .. returns to defending position to protect e pawn  now he wants my centre position!  his dark square bishop can't really do anything useful now and i conveniently get out of a pawn exchange  blocking k-side entry and attacking my bish  only safe place for the bishop  hmmmm... i would have placed knight at c4 attacking other bishop i block that path  trying to attack the lone h pawn  defending the lone h pawn why..? new plan!! h file attack!! this works for me as now his h pawn is vulnerable ... he is preparing to add the dsb to the greenzone  im aware of this  adding the knight to the fire soon  to get rid of the dsb  he chooses to capture rather than retreat  i reciprocate he intends to make use of the f file my rook is ready to come into play  ?? bad idea... its interesting that my attack on his k-side has left my own k-side quite skeletal  he realised his h pawn was again vulnerable  the best move as ...rh6? would lead to g5 and then he would get my knight and get into my kings territory . not going to happen! not good -what about strong f file? preventing g5. safe as f file is not under pressure anymore  another minor attack  touché! he would have benefitted more from qf2, imo .. at last!! my plan commences.. defending no turning back for the bish! opening up the 6th rank doesnt see the danger? despite my king being out in the open he has no real counterattack and now i've got a heavily armed h file  don't know why he does this  tearing down those walls! nice! uh oh! the king must step aside from his lady! if he takes with the knight he loses the other knight but it is better than taking with the rook... mistake because... 37...be3!! at this point he resigns as he will lose his rook and i will have the advantage to compose a quick win. hope you enjoyed the annotation! :d 
-------------------------------------
contesting the centre in traditional fashion. counterthrust. stonewall setup.  not the most aggressive but easy development to hopefully iniyialise a kingside attack. versatile.  aiming at centre. not committing the kings bishop yet and leaving c1/h3 diagonal open. well, i think i will carry on with plan.  central development and start aiming at the black kingside. ok...swift natural development..knights before bishops and aiming at the centre...certainly black is playing solid. i can't carry on with my development until i prevent black's knight coming to b4, which is a nuisance as it will dislodge my centrally placed bishop.  i could play a3 or c3 to stop that.  c3 gives the advantage of a retreat square for my bishop and also overprotects d4.  yep...looks like c3. wow.  here she comes already!  i didn't even get a chance to play f4, followed by nf3 and castles.  that's the stonewall out of the window.  ok...what are my options?  i'm fairly restricted in choices f3/nd2/dxe5/ne2....everything else looks unnatural or suicidal.   f3 makes me feel a little uneasy with my king looking slightly vulnerable.    nd2 looks a little better, preparing for f3 in my own time.    dxe5 doesn't look too bad.  i get to keep a solid pawn formation and a strong point for one of my knights on d4.  however, emma would get to play c5 in short order, chasing away my brilliant knight and then b6 opening up the killing diagonal a8/h1 for her white squared bishop (wsb) onto my castled king if i castle kingside....not liking that!  how about ne2?..then probably after retreating my bishop to c2 following blacks e4 push, i could play ng3,nd2,0-0 and f3....looks like a plan!     mmmmm. hang on..she can play bg4 which ties me up a bit and then it's difficult to untangle myself.    i might have to play h3 first...bit slow and against opening principles.  should be developing pieces asap.  ok...going back to nd2.  of course if she takes on d4 i shall retake with the e pawn and i will be very comfy....but she will almost certainly push e4, but i always have f3 later to diffuse things in that area and at least i will have 2 pieces developed if i play it in this order....yep...i think i will play nd2. black is beginning to aim all her bits towards me king.  she is playing very aggressively...i have had considerable success where black develops routinely and i have been allowed to play f4, then develop my knights on e5 and f3.....this is a different ball game and i don't feel entirely comfortable here. the last thing i now want in this situation is black pushing e4 and semi-locking the centre.  my qb will be hemmed in and virtually out of play, in fact my entire queenside would be very restricted.  that is such an issue for me that i'm not even considering anything else right now.  i really hate being cramped.  tactically, i'm not bad so i need to keep the position as open as i can....maybe even work towards castling queenside and storming the kings wing with my rooks belching up the g and h files....but she will launch a similar storm on the queenside....mmmmm! i need to play to my strengths...ok...f3. whoops!...that's embarrassing.   i didn't much like the alternatives and just didn't see that at all!  i was so absorbed and convinced that black was going to push e4,   i didn't even go through the stage..'what has changed?'...well it's painfully obvious what had changed...black's queen was now on the same alignment as my king! oh well lets try and salvage something at least....it's not all bad....just 98% of it! i have to at least try to get some compensation by trying to activate my rooks on the e file...even though iit will be a miracle if i get time to do that! might just be able to castle long and get a teeny weeny bit of counterplay....might work against a weaker player anyway, but not young apt i greatly fear. don't like either option much.  if i take with the knight black will push the d4 pawn lever and i am toast.  there is some compensation in taking with the b pawn to give a little gasping space for my queens bishop, strong-point the d4 square and open the b file to activate my rook.    however, there is a lot to do just in order to develop properly.  my knights are misplaced, my rooks are a million miles from being connected and i'm material down  oh no!...not on the wing as well!   sorry emma!...embarrassing.  all chess conventions broken and hurled through the arched window!...just trying to survive my blunder.  well, i have to minimise the damage on the wing and definitely can't sit back and wait for black to open me up with a pawn charge down the h file.  i can't get my king to safety anywhere as there is no shelter.  maybe on f2 and try to barricade.....but black's bc5 then looks highly uncomfortable.. mmmm..castled kingside.  wasn't expecting that.... ok..slim chance of counterplay on the kingside...although well dodgy with the centre so open....but have to have some sort of plan.  i need to block the b8/h2 diagonal which is causing me much concern.  perhaps with pawns on f4 and g3.. i think this is of major immediate concern in order to survive.  but my pieces are awful...how did it get so bad?  i think my queen would be more use on theb1/h7 diagonal and perhaps my knights on d4 and f3....my kingdom for a few tempi!   ouch.  centralises the knight, attacks my only good bishop and prepares for c5 well, i can't afford to waste any more tempi by retreating my bishop, if i activate my queens rook at least it will be working on a semi-open file, maybe giving me a chance for some sort of minority attack.  i don't like the thought of black exchanging on d3 then playing g6 followed by bf5, but what can i do?...the game was lost on move 7.  if i don't play my rook to b1 now, i may never get the chance again. consolidates and gives room for her queen to swing onto c7 if needed for a battery along the b8/h2 diagonal esp. pressure on g3 if i try to swing my knights into more active positions. on one hand i don't want to lose yet another tempo but on the other hand i really need to hang on to control of the c1/h7 diagonal to at least have some token chance on the kings wing. i need that extra pressure on the e-file like a hole in the head.  i think i need to push e4 pretty soon but first i need one of my knight on g3. maybe i can get up ontof5 with a bit of prep although g6 seems to kill off hopes of activity there. charging down the queenside.  she could easily overwhelm me there with a pawn storm.  still, might give me an opportunity to do something over the kingside, while she's preoccupied.  whatever, i must activate my pieces sooner than immediately! ah!...here is a chance to maybe get rid of one of her pesky bishops.  if she defends c6, i play nef5 or ngf5. oh blast!...check!...too wrapped up in my own feeble desperate plans. no choice.  have to take or i go even more material down...and my position is shot to pieces either way! into the frying pan!...have to protect e3.  if 17....nxe3,  18.qd3 is a possibility with a double attack on e3 and h7+.  if 17....qf6+,  !8.ndf4,....g6,  19.qd4!    which eases some of my problems.    have to try it...cheap shot!   oh $%£!  she also has a free move with the knight because of the sqewer on the queen.  i did see this earlier but was only thinking of n25, but of course she will probably play nxe3 and i am toast.  i could still play q d4 but her attack looks 100% fatal. didn't see that one...but it was all over anyway!  nice one emma. 
-------------------------------------
hi everyone!  here is a match where i am playing a class b player.  in the middlegame both players castle on opposite sides.  black tries to create a rook line up on my kingside position whereas i somehow manage to win material which ought to be decisive by a few line openers on the queenside.  however, in the endgame, despite being 5 material points up, henry ends up in a mating net.  but is there to be a houdini act?  read on, inquest jury, i say, read on! 1. ….. b6 - unusual response to the reti. 3. bg2 - aha!  a bishop v bishop stare down along the h1-a8 diagonal! 4. 0-0 - got henry castled early, on second thoughts, is it too early?!  we shall see. 6. c4 - after a series of third rank pawn placements i finally decide to put one of them on the fourth rank, the c column.  this paves the way for sir lollabout to emerge on c3 without impeding a pawn. 7. nc3 - all four knights are developed. 8. …...g5 - allo, allo, allo - the start of a pawn storm? 9. be3 - time to get as many pieces out as possible to deal with such a threat. 11. qc2 - if king qr19kaash goes queenside, glenda is waiting to welcome him via the c file! 12. rad1 - now my rook stares down the bq on the d file! 13. d4 - that little seed of an attack again starts to germinate in my head, when that happens i bet you are glad to be reading this game rather than be my opponent.  this idea is to try and storm the queenside castled position by opening lines.  this will distract black from getting any further with his kingside attack.  i think i am finally learning a bitter lesson from my loss against the dentist many years ago when i failed to find any similar counterplay when we both castled on opposite sides and succumbed to passivitis and a 3 pawn loss in the endgame.  i the black queen will not make that mistake again! 15. c5! - let the line opening begin! 17. na4 - hitting at b6. 18. …… e5? - loses a piece for a pawn. 22. …… h4 - black carries on with his pawn storm but i grab more material with check and keep black very busy with threats. 24. nxf7 - more black wood disappears from the board. 26. …. kxd8 - this plethora of exchanges takes us into an endgame.  at least with one pair of rooks and the queens off the board, black's mating attack has been reduced to nil, or so i thought! 29. exd5 - another set of pieces has been exchanged and more significantly a passed pawn appears on the d column. 31. be4 - attacking black's remaining rook, but it will prove to be very annoying. 33. bc5 - preparing a pawn advance. 34. ….. bc5 - uh, uh, at the moment, henry is boxed in.  it only needs one piece to checkmate him but will he find it?  we shall see! 36. d6+ fou leblanc is en prise and the pawn on a3 will fall when he moves.  thankfully i can get my d pawn one square closer to glendadom with check before i have to deal with the skewer.  being 5 points ahead on material, the loss of a pawn isn't that bad in itself, the bigger concern is that rascally rook using a3 to get to a1 to deliver mate! 38. bf5+ - black does take that pawn and henry really is in old matey's shadow.  before i play my rook back to defend my back row i prepare another pawn advance with check. 40. d7 - now that my pawn is soooo close to glendadom i can afford to let my rook hang.  i now set up a few conditional moves. 48. d8/q - boy am i glad to see glenda, but can she save her beleaguered spouse? 41. …… ra1 - black threatens to move his bishop to any square to deliver mate.  looking at the bottom half of the board you would think i was about to hit the resign button wouldn't you?  but …... 42. qd7 mate!!!! yup, my deadly diva glenda gets in first with a swallow's tail mate - wheew and many times over wheew! 
-------------------------------------
1. .......d5 - the centre counter defence - black can play qxd5 but the bq does get chased around. 2. e5 - white does not take on d5! 2. …. f6 - bit dubious here - it opens up the fool's mate diagonal and it does not develop a piece.  however, if white plays exf6 black can recapture with nxf6 which is development and prevents a wq getting to h5. 4. nf3 - development. 5. …. c5 - black has moved a lot of pawns and developed no pieces! 9. ….. nxf6 - black's position has improved after this plethora of exchanges.  he does have a strong pawn centre. 13. …… d4 - it looks as though black will win a piece here.  however, another white knight comes to the rescue by forking the bq and the bb on d6. 17. …. dxc3 - black regains his piece but ….. 19. nxc3 - ..... white is 2 pawns up. 20. …… nd5 - only way to save rook on a8. 21. 0-0 - white finally castles and unpins his knight. 24. qxa8 - white has a terrific material advantage after this.  his opponent plays on a few moves however. 26. qxa7 - another pawn falls. 28. rad1 - pin. 30. rxd6 - after this move black finally resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  after nxd3, fxe3 white is an overwhelming 10 points up on material.  white brilliantly exploited the trapped rook on a8 in the middle game and caused black to lose very heavy material.  an excellent expert victory for ab15 in a blitz game! 
-------------------------------------
tras mi habitual jugada, quedaba esperar que me depararía el azar. sí sí, !así mismo!... la versatilidad en el repertorio de mi rival era tan amplia y aleatoria que su primera jugada era todo un enigma...   !para nada se apoderó de mi sentimiento alguno de sorpresa! al fin y al cabo, iba mentalizado a enfrentarme a cualquier defensa.  desde hacía tiempo mi línea favorita era el ataque de los cuatro peones, pero hoy en día ya no me resulta tan atractiva. así que...  inocentemente pensé que bauer capturaría con el peón de "c", para buscar una partida más desequilibrada. pero realmente, tomar con peón "e" también tiene su veneno, a pesar de la posición tan simétrica. alternative variation: [tras] 5... cxd6 [ llegamos a una variante principal de la defensa alekhine, donde el blanco ha llevado a cabo con suficiente éxito el plan siguiente:] 6. nc3 g6 7. be3 bg7 8. rc1 o-o 9. b3 e5 ([si] 9... nc6 10. d5 $1) 10. dxe5 dxe5 11. qxd8 rxd8 12. c5 n6d7 13. bc4 $14 [posición que parece favorable al blanco según ha demostrado la práctica.]  [%csl ge2] el caballo es más flexible en "e2" para evitar la molesta clavada con bg4.  alternative variation: [el problema de] 10. o-o [es que permitiría] nb4 [y no podríamos jugar] 11. bb1 $2 [para conservar la pareja de alfiles, ya que nos podrían contestar con] nxc4 12. qb3 nxe3 [ganando peón.]  [%csl rd4]  maniobra muy útil. una de las reglas de oro del ajedrez dice que cuando se tiene desventaja de espacio, hay que tratar de cambiar piezas, para poder liberarse. y eso es precisamente lo que se pretende con 12.. .bh5 seguido de bg6.  diagrama # mentiría si dijese que esta idea la saqué en el tablero. lo cierto es que hace tiempo vi una partida del gm arkadij naiditsch, que me gustó bastante por su simpleza en la ejecución del plan. la idea de poner la  torre de "a" en e1 tiene la virtud de mantener la otra torre en la columna "f", donde podría ser útil en un futuro, tras el plan h3-g4-ng3, y un posible avance con f4.

[%csl rg4][%cal gh5g4] aquí bauer hizo una de esas jugadas que esperan pasar desapercibidas, para posteriormente servirle de arma para darle la vuelta a la partida. pero lo cierto es que era un farol, y la simple captura del peón le habría creado más problemas de forma innecesaria. alternative variation: [si] 27... ra3 28. ra1 [y la columna es del blanco, lo cual sería un hándicap más para las negras.] nb2 29. qc2 $1 $16  continua con el plan previsto, pero dada la última jugada de mi rival, mejor era: alternative variation: 28. gxh5 gxh5 (28... nf5 $2 29. bxc7 $1 $18) 29. qf3 [ [%csl rd5,rh5]] ra3 30. bc1 rxc3 31. qxc3 nf5 $18 [y no hay compensación alguna.]  otro concepto posicional: "cambiar la única pieza activa del rival."  quizás la única chance práctica de mi rival es dar coletazos entregando peones y jugando activo.  [%csl rd5]  y aquí se ve como su arriesgada jugada con 27...h5 (que no fue castigada) pudo comenzar a crearme serias molestias. por suerte, su contrajuego no alcanzó a ser suficiente.  poniendo todo en orden.  alternative variation: 35... qh3 36. rbd1 [[%csl rh3] y la dama está inestable en h3.]  entrando en un final en el que pensé que éste me otorgaría una ventaja decisiva por la incipiente presión en c7.  mi amenaza es clara, 38.bf4, haciendo daño en el punto antes mencionado.  ?qué otra cosa se podría hacer?  ahora se amenaza rxd6, además de g5 seguido de rh4 con mate inevitable.  alternative variation: [si] 40. rxd6 rxd6 41. rxd6 rc1+ [intermedia] 42. kg2 cxd6 [pero parece que a pesar de ello] 43. bd4 [debe ganar.]  y el resto de las jugadas ya son consecuencia natural del trabajo hecho anteriormente.  y bauer abandonó ante la inevitable pérdida de pieza.   debido al prestigioso rival y a la partida tan lineal que se produjo, sin duda, recordaré esta partida como una de mis mejores batallas ajedrecísticas.

 however, maybe black can give up his c6 knight.   after 23. nb7 qg8!?   24. re2 qh7   25. kf2 qh2   26. qg1, the c6 square feels miles away.   i don't think the knight is worth the g2 pawn. however, he takes, to my relief. other moves (e.g. qh4, rb1, qb3) may be too slow.   or may end up similar; not entirely sure!   this at least keeps up the checks. black had a bit of an aul think here; i didn't see his next move though (partly because of the time control obviously; i just played the obvious because it looked right) the other rook may have been better - leaving the a-rook and the queen to gang up on the a7 pawn - but i had it in my mind that the e-rook was soon to be needed at e2 in a defensive capacity.   but after 27. reb1+ nb6 28. bxb qxb 29. qxp+, i pick up black's queen.   maybe a similar sac as in the game would have been on for black. have to remove the defender. more to free up the d8-h4 diagonal for the queen than to remove the bishop. an ! for black here, i think.   there's a lot of checks coming; i have to be very careful.   the slower 29...rhg8 may fail to 30. re2 qg5 31. qd7+ ka8 32. qc6+ kb8 33. rxn+! pxr 34. qxp+ and i've a draw anyway, and a win given any tempo to get in c6. i'm rook for pawn up, both knights are hanging and black is on a king-hunt. 31. kf2 allows qxn with check.   kf3 seems to be asking too much after 31...rh3+ it's possible black felt he didn't have time to take my knight because of his own weak knight - i'm threatening the curious qd7+, with the queen immune from capture as the knight is pinned.   black may need to keep up the checks, and material be damned. and, similarly, a pinned knight allows black a move i hadn't considered.   i'm fairly sure nf3 was still correct though.   but i thought i had everything covered until black played this. anything else hangs the knight with check. the knight is doing sterling work, now preventing q (or r)d2#.   with black a rook down, his knight unable to join the action and his two major pieces struggling to get in at my king, black may have to settle for perpetual here.   if he can find it.   meanwhile, with the knight hanging, i can sac a fair bit of material to end the checks. here, kd4 loses the queen, though black's rook and knight are both hanging!   (a sample line may be 36. kd4 qg4+ 37. ke3 qxq 38. nxr qe4+ and there's chances of picking up the knight or the important c5-pawn - saving black's knight - with checking forks).   after ke3, we seem to have perpetual.   i don't think black was expecting my next move though. !!   the checks are over, and with black's knight hanging, i'll come out of the exchanges material up.   a swap off will remove black's queen as well, and if black doesn't want to swap, he can't stop qd7+ (or qe8+ if the king moves back).   after 36...qg2 37. pxn, i have all the checking squares on the second rank covered.   and again, stuff like 36...qg2 37. pxn pxr+ 38. qxp+ and i think black is getting mated.   don't anyone dare refute this move! :) i've always enjoyed how, in tal v hecht from the varna olympiad (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1139582), all tal's wild sacs are ultimately just to reach a technically won - but not straightforward - endgame.   i don't for an instant pretend to be a tal, but i do like how i've emulated him ever so slightly here!   there's still a long way to go to bring home the point though; black has decent drawing chances.   tal's achieved endgame was easier to win! covering f5 and so helping support the e5-pawn for now. the knight falls, having stood pinned and hanging for 12 moves. eyeing the d6 square and the f7 pawn. a bit of a botún here; i missed that black can now play f5 without fear of capture black missed it too, fortunately! stopping the f-pawn's advance to an extent - i can take without hanging my knight.  though 46...f5 is probably still good for black here - i think i need at least one pawn to win, and pxpep leaves me with just the one.   possibly i could try centralising with 47. rd4; if black takes, my pawns are re-connected, and my knight is much stronger.   any other move may let me gain space with rc4+, forcing the king back.   or perhaps, better was just nc4 ??   black needed that pawn. ?? a shame of a way to end a highly entertaining game.   but such is the way of blitz at times.

?! this opening (the ponziani, for those who care) is dubious because white is trying to build a big center but neglecting to develop the necessary pieces to support it. nf3 is far more common, and nc3, f4, d4 and even c4 or g3 are better as well.  ?! interesting. the queenside fianchetto (that is, playing …b6 followed by …bb7) is fine in a vacuum, but it doesn't usually mix well with …e5.  also, white's last move was begging to be embarrassed with …nf6, which is basically a "free" move. you have to be on the lookout for those kinds of tempo-gaining moves in the opening! this move is fine, but what about d4? that was the point of 2. c3, no? i like how you attack white's pawn instead of stopping to defend your own – both are good plans, but your move shows ambition and commitment to your own plans. ?! are we sure the queen wants to be here? why not develop the minor pieces first, and then see where the best place for the queen is? (…nc6) white should consider g3 and bg2, although that is a bit slow. ? there is no need to move this pawn at all. develop your pieces!!!!  also, this pawn may well want to move to d5 some time down the line. (in fact, it does do that, at move 13.) that makes …d6 a wasted move, unless you had some important need for it to go to d6 first (you don't). on top of that, now the dsb (dark-squared bishop) is locked in. ! developing with a gain of time on your exposed queen. ? the knight belongs here. white wants to trap your queen, which is wishful thinking. ! good! boot that bishop! ?? oops. white made an understandable, but still awful, blunder here. ! good, you saw it! alright, at this point black is up a piece. white really doesn't have any compensation. this should be enough to win, no problem – if i were writing for experts, and felt lazy, i'd write,  "the rest is a matter of technique." of course, having a won game is not the same thing as winning it – let's see how you go about doing that. good start. black needs to develop pieces. !? i like how you kick this knight out so that you can finish development. that's high-level planning. ? what is the point of this? for the next few moves, white just marks time with aggressive-looking moves and wait for you to make a mistake. ? on one hand, there is some very good thinking behind this move – you're seizing more influence in the center and releasing your dsb. you're also rightfully ignoring white's pointless pawn pushes and doing your own thing. before you open the center like this, though, you really, really need to develop your pieces. that includes getting your king out of the center first, too. …0-0-0 is a must.  this has nothing to do with your play in the center, which is the central issue of the game right now. 0-0 or rd1 are better. ? good, you're continuing to ignore the pawn pushes. this move is too impatient, though.  it looks like you're trying to open b4 or c5 for your dsb, which is admirable. still, it would have been better to castle and keep the tension in the center. (tension is a pretty advanced skill, but development is development.)  b4! is much better. ! activating the knight, and making lots of threats. ! best. good for you – with some cooperation from your opponent, you got the square you wanted for the bishop, and an extra pawn besides. tension again – it's not a big deal, and it's pretty advanced, but there's no need to rush this capture. (…0-0-0!) at last!  actually, …nd7 to guard the e-pawn was safer. still, it all works out. !? i was going to say that you missed the fork on f7, but then i realized you had seen it, and seen further. this next tactical exchange is impressive on your part, showing potential far beyond your current rating. still, it doesn't get a full '!' because the whole thing would be unnecessary if you'd just defended f7. ! nice! moving the other rook would let you recapture on d8, which is a better square for the remaining rook. a small, subtle thing to think about. ?! at this point, you start drifting a bit, until your opponent self-implodes and lets you off the hook. it's important to have a plan, even (especially?) when you've got a big advantage. i realize you were probably short of time, but planning will (in the long run) actually help you move better, faster.  here, a sample plan could be to try and create a passed pawn while exchanging pieces, and then push that passed pawn to the end of the board. …rd8, targeting the d-pawn, would be a good start, plus it'd win a pawn. (rd1? nxe4! 26. nxe4 bxe4 27. dxe4 rxd1+ – using a pin) once the d-pawn is out, the c-pawn can be pushed all the way. it's good that you didn't break up your pawns with bxa5. why bother with …b5, though? there is no real threat from axb6, so …rd8 was again best. ?! you're voluntarily entombing your bishop! don't do that to your pieces!!!!  either defend in a more piece-friendly way (…bc6) or ignore the b-pawn and go after the much more important d-pawn with …rd8. ! now black's queenside is temporarily awkward. not a fatal problem, but there was no need for it.  good, making use of your king. ? i get that white is trying to round up the b-pawn, but this move completely liquidates your cramp on the queenside. ! showing the bishop some long-overdue love. ?! back to the drifting. where are you going with this?  you need to train yourself to always ask the question, "what am i trying to accomplish?"  with so many pawns traded off, now you need to go after some of white's pawns – which should be easy, with an extra piece to work with – to clear the way for one of your own. ? i'm guessing you missed that the knight could take, but still, after fxg3, what have you accomplished? your pawns are your path to victory in an endgame like this; don't squander them! again, i don't see where this is going. how about activating your rook, who's been out of the game for 17 moves now? (…rb8 or rd8) ?? giving you a big opportunity, which you duly take advantage of. had white not done this, the game could have continued indefinitely, unless you started playing much more intentionally. ! bam! the long game has clearly not dulled your tactical vision. good find! white should really be resigning here; now the win is easy. ?? as happens so often, one bad move follows another. !! excellent! it'd be easy to get complacent after going a rook and a bishop up, but you stayed sharp and put him away with a judicious pin. good game! (your opponent missed it, but kd2 would have made it more complicated. still, white was totally lost to begin with and the resignation is overdue.) it's fitting that, after you had ridden your tactical skills so hard to an overwhelming position, you would again finish off with a tactic. thing is, your opponents won't always drop opportunities like this into your lap. you need to learn to "make your own luck" – to plan and strategize so that you are constantly improving your position on your own initiative instead of waiting for stronger opponents to beat you and for weaker opponents to fold.

-------------------------------------
el enfoque creativo con el que afronté este torneo, se reflejó de la forma más precisa en esta partida. ninguna pretensión de apertura, intentando trasladar al medio juego el peso de una adecuada comprensión de la posición y la elaboración de los planes subsiguientes.  debo mencionar que la apertura inglesa la jugué en mi primer campeonato nacional durante el año de 1988. a lo largo de los años he seguido alguno de los esquemas más representativos, especialmente el que en esta posición comienza con g3. sin embargo, hice el movimiento de la partida intentado llevar la partida a una posición tipo siciliana invertida, contando con que mi adversario pudiera no estar consciente de ello y tuviera que encontrar un plan de juego desacostumbrado.  la práctica me hace considerar que el movimiento más fuerte en esta posición es ab4 por su incidencia concreta en la lucha por el centro.  este movimiento lo hice por analogía a la posición equivalente de la defensa siciliana en el que la casilla c4 es un objetivo tradicional. en esta posición, la casilla c5 se convierte en este objetivo. también consideré este movimiento tratando de evitar que fuera cambiado en la siguiente jugada negra si hacía el movimiento mecánico 0-0, lo cual ami parecer, disminuiría sensiblemente la posibilidad de crear complicaciones en el flanco de dama.  alternative variation: 11... f5 12. qc2 nf6 (12... e4 13. dxe4 fxe4 14. qxe4 rad8 15. o-o $16) 13. o-o kh8 14. nc5 bxc5 15. qxc5 e4 16. nd4 nxd4 17. qxd4 qxd4 18. exd4 $14  contando con la siguiente jugada negra  alternative variation: 13... qd5 [esta jugada podría haber sostenido mejor la posición negra, manteniendo la tensión.]  este es el movimiento que establece la ventaja en esta línea. mi intención es buscar el cambio en el centro, lo que abre la posición conventaja blanca intentando aprovechar las debilidades de la estructura de peones en el flanco de dama negro. un detalle en particular en este momento es que al jugar d4 inmediatamente se evita que las negras pongan en movimiento su masa de peones con b5 lo que podría otorgarles incluso ventaja.  alternative variation: 14... e4 [línea propuesta en el análisis de la partida por mi amigo josué velázquez en la que se procura que el peón negro en e4 obstruya la adecuada protección del flanco de rey blanco y la armoniosa ubicación de las piezas. se evita también la línea de la partida en la que todo es más cómodo para la blancas. dejaré intacta la secuencia propuesta por el módulo de análisis.] 15. nd2 f5 16. bc4 rfd8 17. o-o rac8 18. qb3 bxc4 19. qxc4+ qd5 20. qxd5+ rxd5 21. nc4 bd8 22. a4 bc7 23. na3 na7 24. bd2 kf7 25. h4 nc6 26. nb5 bb8 27. bc3 ne7 28. f3 exf3 29. rxf3 rc4 30. e4 rd8 [[%eval 32,21]]   es en particular por esta jugada por la que me atreví a comentar esta partida. al tener todavía a mi monarca en el centro, la secuencia obvia pasaba por un inmediato enroque. sin embargo, tuve la fortuna de no precipitarme y considerar esta jugada a la que le dediqué varios minutos durante los cuales consideré diversas ramificaciones, después de las cuales sentí que lograría en cualquiera de ellas una posición muy ventajosa.  alternative variation: 16... f5 17. nxf5 rxf5 18. e4 $18  alternative variation: 19... g6 [si las negras hubieran ralizado esta jugada, ya había pensado en el plan de2 seguido de h4 con lo que seguén mis consideraciones obtenía una ataque directo sobre el rey negro. no es la línea que propone el módulo lamentablemente, pero ya lo había decidido. como decía el gran tahl "cuando me gusta una jugada ya no busco otra, y como no la busco pues no la encuentro, y como no la encuentro pues hago la que me gusta"] 20. qe2 qe8 21. bb3 bd6 22. h4 $40  alternative variation: 20... b5 [este era el único movimiento que me preocupaba y realmente no tengo claro que hubiera jugado. todo el resto de la partida el alfil en c3 ejerció una presión devastadora, por lo que cuando tuve conciencia de esta posibilidad me sentí intranquilo a pesar de que consideraba una clara ventaja para las blancas. el módulo propone la siguiente línea  en la que establece una clara ventaja blanca, pero de la que estoy seguro yo no habría seguido simplemente porque no habría cambiado mi alfil por el caballo y la que tal vez habría dejado escapar mi ventaja.] 21. o-o b4 22. axb4 axb4 23. bd4 nxd4 24. exd4 bd6 25. rfe1 qg6 26. bf5 qh6 27. qxh6 gxh6 $16  tal vez el negro mantenía la imagen residual del alfil ejerciendo presión a lo largo de la diagonal b1-h7 y hace este movimiento que traslada la presión a la diagonal negra...hasta el final de la partida.  esta maniobra la propuso el módulo sin cambiar en d8. tratando de comprender lo importante de la posición llegué a una conclusión tipo botvinnik (ustedes perdonarán lo pretencioso): !hay que cambiar las torres y mantener los alfiles!  alternative variation: 27. g4 [una jugada muy concreta, ejerciendo presión rápidamente sobre f6. sin embargo, francamente fuera de mi alcance.]  limitando hasta el movimiento b4.   
-------------------------------------
j'y vais avec une ouverture moins classique. attaque immédiate dans le but d'ouvrir le centre. le recul du fou n'était peut-être pas la meilleur option.  je crois que exd3 aurait été mieux, exd3 suivi de exd3 cela laisse la ligne du roi bien ouverte. le fou vient soutenir le pion en d5 cela est un coup risqué, à cause de la diagonale possible du fou en b7. maintenant le fou en e3 est attaqué et la menace bxg2 est présente. ce coup était bon, dans les circonstances. ici j'essayais de poursuivre la pression sur le fou, mais, après réflexion, je crois que j'aurais dû y aller avec bxg2. ce coup était trés mauvais, car je donne la chance à mon adversaire de parer la menace de bxg2. ce coup également n'était pas efficace.  nf3 ou f3 aurait été mieux cela aurait mis fin définitivement à la possibilité de bxg2. ici j'enlève le cavalier pour libérer la diagonale bxg2. encore une fois nf3 ou f3 aurait été mieux. là arrive l'attaque. il aurait été préférable de déplacer le fou bf4 pour essayer de sortir le cavalier en d2 par la suite.  maintenant bxa3 suivi de bxa3, vienne de tuer toute possibilité de roque. le roque, même si ouvert, aurait peut être été mieux.  la tour aurait attaqué le fou et reine assurait la protection du cavalier qui est maintenant sans défense. ici, j'ai paré l'attaque avec le fou, mais j'aurais dû y aller avec le cavalier (ng4) car du même coup j'aurais attaqué le fou en h6.  
-------------------------------------
the usual defence.  allowing bb4+. a try.  i'm not sure this was good for black, but anyway... second try. the logical bc5 was good, i don't know this one.  third try. ii got nowhere.  but this gives me the opportunity to show this trick. i sweared i will recover the piece, sooner or later.  if fxn, bxn. white tries to keep the piece.  bxn was better. bxb5... harassing the dsb.  i can't believe it. i am self-tangled.  and besides, i blundered another pawn.  defending was losing. so i tried the last one.  knowing i will end with doubled pawns. but in the 6ª row, and with a white pawn in f7.  now i won't advance my pawns, and the white king cannot capture them.  ...and three connected pawns can be stopped by the king, just as two! white is in zugszwang!

questo seguito è stato reso popolare da rossolimo e ha preso il nome proprio dal maestro francese che l'ha impiegata con successo alla fine degli anni '40 considerato il seguito migliore per il nero oggi il seguito più popolare è 4.axc6, mentre all'epoca in cui fu giocata la partita si preferiva 4.0-0 il seguito più energico per il nero è 4...cf6! anche ora era da preferirsi 6...cf6! andare a caccia di pedoni trascurando lo sviluppo è pericoloso il bianco non esita a sacrificare materiale per accelerare lo sviluppo. 7.axc6? sarebbe stata troppo remissiva. senza alcun motivo, l'alfiere si sarebbe trasformato in un "divoratore di tempi": con lui sarebbero infatti spariti dalla scacchiera anche i due "tempi" (ab5 e poi axc6) coerente con le mosse precedenti, questa cattura si rivelerà disastrosa guadagnando ancora tempi di sviluppo. questo cavallo sarà tremendo 8...da5+ sarebbe stata ancora peggiore dopo 9.ad2 ovviamente l'alfiere in b5 è intoccabile a causa del doppio di cavallo in c7 una mossa goffa ma necessaria. la regina è legata alla difesa di c7 e incombe la minaccia di af4 dopo 9...dd8?! 10. af4 e5 (se 10...da5+ 11. b4)! 11.dc3! il nero è già spacciato non 10.af4? ae5! e il nero resiste non era certo il momento di pensare a guadagnare altro materiale. dopo 10...axb2? 11. 0-0! axa1 12.txa1 (minacciando 13.af4 e 13. ab4) il bianco ha completato il suo sviluppo ed è pronto ad un attacco imparabile, visto che le forze del nero stanno ancora sonnecchiando il confronto dello sviluppo delle due parti è impietoso. il nero può farsene ben poco del pedone in più il cavallo bianco in d5 è una presenza assai scomoda per il nero, tuttavia dopo 12...exd5 13.exd5 l'apertura della colonna e sarebbe stata fatale. il bianco continua tranquillamente a trovare le case migliori per i suoi pezzi la minaccia dello scacco in c7 costringe il nero a catturare il dannato cavallo le alternative non erano molto meglio. dopo 14...f6 15.tfe1+ rf7 16.de3 il nero è imbottigliato. il male minore era forse 14...ce7 15.tfe1 0-0, restituendo materiale per cercare di porre il re al riparo. ll bianco avrebbe comunque mantenuto una psizione vincente. quando si è sotto attacco occorre sempre considerare le possibilità di restituire materiale per smorzare l'attacco dopo 15...rd8 16.dxf7 il nero prende matto anche questa vince, ma ancora più efficace era 16.txc8+! dxc8 17.txe5+ rd8 18.de3 e cala il sipario e ora via al gran finale il nero avrebbe comunque preso matto anche non catturando la torre il matto è immediato dopo 23...cf6 24. axf6+ e poi 25. de5 matto oppure 24...rxg8 25. de8+ rg7 26. axf6+ e matto in poche a 27... rf4 segue 28.de3 matto una dimostrazione impressionante dei rischi del ritardo nello sviluppo 
-------------------------------------
hasta ahora, todo "parejito" (felipe sanhueza) era mejor para las negras jugar 17, cb6 (fs) las negras deben ser precisas o se viene un inminente aplaste (fs) mucho mejor era para las blancas seguir intentando ganar terreno con g4(fs) según fritz hay igualdad absoluta(fs) ahora de hecho hay ligera ventaja negra viendolo desde el punto de vista material(fs) simplificando piezas juan lo unico que logra es que la ventaja negra sea mayor (fs) continuan la ventaja negra, pero era mas exacto que las negras hubiesen jugado rf8 (fs) teniendo un tiempo prudente  este final deben ganarlo las negras (fs) esta jugada a diferencia de como dijo juan, no es mala, simplemente las negras sueltan la ventaja para volver a la igualdad segun fritz, era necesario que las negras jugaran ah8. aqui se dejo de anotar la partida pero para que se tenga una idea algunas jugadas posteriores fueron 38.-d7!?- axd7  39.- cxd7-ad6!?   40.-tc2-td5  41.- f4-td1+ 42.-af1-exf4.... las blancas debieron sacrificar una pieza por el peon de b, y estando en un final en el cual las blancas perdian se acordaron tablas debido al apuro de tiempo negro.  1/2 - 1/2(fs) 
-------------------------------------
con ignacio ya habíamos jugado varias partidas, por lo que sé en qué lineas entraría sin falta, por lo que opté por intentar variar el esquema a ver el tipo de respuesta tambien era posible y probablemente mejor para el negro entrar en la variante 9.-cxd4-cxe4!? - 10.-cxc6-cxc3  - 11.-cxd8-cxd1  - 12.-cxb7-axb7 con ligera ventaja negra las blancas no quisieron jugar dd4, ya que el cambio de damas si bien da igualdad para ambos bandos no es del estilo del blanco: entrar en un final tan prematuro. las negras en este momento pasaron por alto una variante la cual yo calculé sin embargo tenia ciertas lineas que si ignacio no veia el blanco quedaria mejor 13.-cd4-cxe4  - 14.-fxe4-cd3 - 15.-dxd3-dxd4+  - 16.-dxd4-axe4+  17.- tf2- axc3 (no axf2 ya que este es el detalle en el cual las blancas quedan superiores) y se entraria en un final donde las negras tienen ligera ventaja sin embargo deben ser exactas en sus jugadas o la ventaja se perderá rapidamente, es un final complejo. las negras por inexperiencia e impulsivamente juegan cd7 en vista de la amenaza que propina el ag7 en el punto d4. la variante 16.-cxg7-dxc3 - 17.-ah6-tfc8 - 18.-cxe6 solo da mayor ventaja al bando blanco mejores resultados para el negro era reaccionar por medio de f5 las blancas aciertan con la mejor jugada, fritz 11 indica que la jugada b4 por parte de las blancas es la jugada que decide el juego en ventaja desiciva para el bando blanco unque las blancas siguen estando con ventaja desiciva la jugada mas fuerte en este punto era f5 ingresando rapidamente en el enroque negro nuevamente las blancas dan la movida mas fuerte segun fritz aqui se dejo de anotar la partida por apuro de tiempo en este punto por apuro de tiempo cometi una impresicion fatal al jugar de3 pasando por alto una jugada la cual calcule mentalmente miehntras jugaba  la siguiente ronda la cual era 26.-ag7+- rxg7 - 27.-dxg5+- rh8  - 28.- df6++      o  bien 26.-ag7+- rh5 - 27.- af3+- g4 - 28.- dxg4++   y francamente creo que darme cuenta de esa jugada en el transcurso de las rondas hizo bajar enormemente mi nivel de juego durante el resto del torneo, pocas veces o la verdad nunca me habia ocurrido omitir un mate en 3 movimientos el cual no era dificil ver. con el blitz las negras resultaron ganadoras e ignacio ocupo el tercer lugar del torneo, de todas maneras aprovecho este medio para felicitar a uno de los jovenes que nos representaran en el futuro de 64 casillas.

samamoodi mängisid ladva ja lapidus ka äsjastel juunioride meistrivõistlustel. siis lapidus ei võtnud d4-etturit. etturikahingu vastuvõtmine annab valgele hea mängu ja pole siin mustadele eriti populaarne lahendus. sellegipoolest on mõned suurmeistrid ka sedasi mänginud. tundub, et lapidus ei ole avanguvarianti kodus uurinud, muidu oleks ta kindlasti valinud käigu 13... b6  sellised käigud nõrgestavad tublisti musta seisu. siin oli valgele väga hea käik 16. h6!  kahjuks ei leidnud ladva siin plaani musta lipu kinnipüüdmiseks. tüüpiline trikk on 17. vh3 ähvardusega rf3-h2. väga hea käik. nüüd päästab ähvarduse vh3 ja rh2 vastu üksnes 18...b6 19.vh3 ra7, kuid efektne 20.a4! rxb5 21. axb5 sunnib musta lipüukaotuse vältimiseks loovutama vankri 21...vc8 22.rh2 ld4 23.cxd4 vxc2 24.oxc2 oxb5+ 25. od3 ning valgel on vigur kahe etturi vastu ning võidušansid üsna head. lapidus ei märka ohtu. aga ka ladva ei näe tekkinud võimalust. lipu võitis 19. vh3! ühes rh2.  taas võitis 20. vh3  kahju. alles nüüd teeb ottomar õige käigu... paraku lippu enam kinni ei püüa. õnnetu käik. must kuningas jääb f8-l tempotule alla. valge võidab viguri, kuid esialgu on asi võidust veel kaugel. ilus variant oleks tulnud pärast 32. rxe5 lh4+ 33. vh3 lf4+ 34. g3 vxf2+ 35. kg1! vf1+! 36. kg2 lxe5! 37. kxf1 lf5+! ning valge peab võidule mängimiseks andma tagasi vankri (muidu igavene tuli), misjärel tekiks aga võrdsete võimalustega seis.  ladva pidi lipukahingut nägema küllalt kaugele ette... vajalik oli 48... f4+ 49. kg4 vh1  ilus löök, mis jätab valgele enamviguri. täpne ratsumanööver lõpeb a-etturi kinnipidamisega. ?? lihtsa võidu annaksid käigud 59. kf3, 59. g3 fxg3 60. fxg3, 59. kg5 jne.  veel oli valgel šanss lipulõppmängus: 63. kxf4 kc3 64. g4 kb2 65. g5 kxa1 66. g6 kb2 67. g7 a1=l 68. g8=l  ?? viigi tegi 65.ke4-d3-c2 nojah... no comments. viik? ilmselt sai mustal aeg otsa...

jürgens lieblingsaufbau gegen queen's blues.  alternative variation: 12. dxc5 qxf4 13. bxf4 bxc5 14. be3 c4 [das feld d4 sieht stark für weiß aus, aber schwarz hier dennoch sehr bequem.] 15. bc5 ( 15. rb2 ng6) 15... rb8  alternative variation: 13. c4 ba6 $15  der normale plan von schwarz besteht nun darin, den könig nach h7 zu bringen.  das jürgen nicht lange wartet war klar. schwarz kann immer noch mit kg8-h7 operieren, aber nach etwas nachdenken gefiehl mir eine weitere option besser.  der könig wandert seelenruhig nach b7. weiß kommt auch nur weiter, wenn er seinen f-bauern in bewegung bringt. dafür muss er aber auch zeit investieren.  alternative variation: 16. nh4 rf8  beide seiten haben ihre ziele erreicht und weiß droht f4-f5.  der gegenstoß kommt genau rechtzeitig.  alternative variation: 21. bf3 fxe5 22. fxe5  verstärkt den druck gegen d5 und erneuert die drohung f5.  22...f5 wäre wahrscheinlich noch präziser. alternative variation: 22... f5 $15  alternative variation: 23. f5 e5 $13  die lage im zentrum hat sich geklärt und nur schwarz kann noch druck am königsflügel ausüben. alternative variation: 24. kh1 $15  nicht schlecht, es ging aber besser. alternative variation: 24... rh8 [ danach ist ...sg6 noch stärker und deshalb ist der turmzug besser. allerdings habe ich ihn komplett nicht beachtet.]  eine gute ausrede, die mich zum langen rechnen zwang.  alternative variation: 25... nh4 [hier rechnete ich bis zum remis.] 26. qf2 hxg5 27. fxg5 rh8 28. qxh4 be8 29. g6 bxg6 30. qf6 bxh5 31. qxe6 rag8+ 32. kh1 nxd4 33. qd7+ ka8 34. cxd4 qxd2 35. qxd5+ kb8 $11  alternative variation: 27... rg7 28. h5 hxg5 29. fxg5 rag8 30. g6 be8 [ist der vorschlag von kommodo, aber zwei so weit vorgerückte bauern erlauben auch keinen fehler mehr.]  die stellung ist unklar. jürgen dachte er stünde besser, aber da die bauern gut blockiert sind, kann davon keine rede sein.  alternative variation: 29... rg7  auf g6 soll bald der springer stehen und ... b5 diente dazu die dame einen weg für die dame frei zu machen.  um die schwarzen felder auszunutzen, wäre 31.dg3 stärker gewesen, mit chancen auf leichten vorteil.  es kündigt sich ein qualleopfer an, welches ich auch unbedingt spielen wollte.  falls weiß darauf verzichtet, hätte ich ...sg6 gezogen mit guter stellung.  alternativen hatten keinen platz mehr in meinen gedanken. 33...dd8 war eine weitere vernüftige lösung.  plötzlich hat sich die stellung verändert und jürgen muss von angriff auf verteidigung umschalten, was ihm nicht mehr gelingt. nach dem springerzug ist weiß verloren. alternative variation: 36. kf2 [davor hatte ich etwas angst, da ich mir nicht sicher war, wie gut die kompensation denn wirklich ist.] qc7 [wir haben hier lange analysiert und in einer partie ist es pychologisch sehr schwer mit weiß die stellung zu spielen.] 37. ke3 (37. ke2) 37... e5 (37... rxg5) 38. dxe5 bc6  und auf einmal taucht auch die dame auf.  mit wenig zeit auf der uhr, ist mir die schlusspointe erst sehr spät aufgefallen.  bis hierhin zu rechnen ist nicht so schwer gewesen, aber wie geht es weiter?  und nicht 42... dh3+ was ich die ganze zeit zum laufen bringen wollte.  weiß verliert zuviel material, weshalb jürgen nur die aufgabe blieb.

nice opening a common move exchange pieces king with open window, i didnt like it kind of jail filling so better getting softer now´s my turn, irregular business all over the table non effective moves, hard to move in this puzzle looking forward to get an active tower!!! but made an awful mistake!! intermidiate idea i thought it´s over, so all in didnt bite, king can smell it vertical triple attack, f4 cannot be in better place, closing kings retreat if he dont get hurry!!! white dindt see it coming?? star running man!!! ke1 now!!!! sacrifice the queen, because chekmate or ng2 and get even how many pawns did he take?? i lost count get even a mistake and its over! ups i really nice game, succesful vertical attack!! thank you  
-------------------------------------
jerome gambit. he is going for the king. not many moves to prevent and keep bishop and knight in play for further planning. the winning move perhaps. whites king is on e-line and a fork on ng6! if he goes for it. i may have material enough maybe even legs to finish him. and it comes. if i take it my rook is history, but his queen will need at least 1 move to be back in action. so i go for it! and he is falling just where i wanted him to fall. here we go! now it is a matter of how long will he last!? searching for mate in 1. he is forced to move kd1. another opening. still his queen in the corner. can�t do much from there. he is doing all he can to stall. looks tough for white since he has so many undeveloped pieces and queen terribly misplaced.  a better move is: nd4 followed by nc3, then see puzzle 48635.  what can you do? once again forcing him to play my way. mate in 2 perhaps, but he will prolly struggle more. its close now... any last wishes, before we close the store? unfortunately my opponent didn�t see it coming and still his queen nicely in the corner. 
-------------------------------------
white indicated he was interested in playing the benoni with me, rather than the sicilian.  however, i am not entirely prepared with the benoni, so i decide to mirror his opening move and see what the master player has in mind. i am hoping for a qg game, as i'm pretty good there as well.   in this game, because of the next few decisions stay fixed for much of the game resulting in a relatively closed game.  queens gambit! white applies immediate pressure to the d5 pawn. black has various choices here, in no particular order: dxc4 (qga), e6 (qgd), nf3 (marshall), c6 (slav, after c6), among others. i've not studied all of these well enough. i've reviewed marshall (nf3), but have spent more time with either qga (dxc4) or qgd (e6).   in addition, given my opponent's rating he could probably play these positions blindfolded, so i thought maybe playing something this typical might produce a complacent move. let's see how it turns out.  qg declined. black decides to not accept the pawn at c4 and instead moves to defend d5. cramping a bit the lsb, but he'll be ok with it in a while. normal developing move pressuring the d5 pawn.  and black responds counter with the same move. pressure mounting. white pins the knight to the queen reducing the defense on d5 and threatening to double the pawns on the file spoiling a kingside castle. further development for black, removes the benefit for white to exchange at f6 and moves closer to the castle. this move further supports the d4 pawn, but more importantly opens lines or the lsb and queen. specifically, the lsb now defends the c4 pawn and the queen line prevents black from moving ng4 anytime soon. castle normal development i debated here whether to move nd7 (orthodox defense) or h6 (neo orthodox). i decided on the orthodox even though it is a bit more cramped.   i am not as strong with knights as i would like to be. in fact, in general i do not like knights at all, not my favorite piece. the orthodox line depends on piece exchange for black to stay in the game and i figured this would be one way to remove those pesky critter knights. :) so the opening attack begins, white strikes first at the center! black retakes offering up his first knight!  nice bishop fork.  good exchange for white. the white dsb was less valuable then the black dsb given center pawn structure. now black is stuck with a lsb that can't move easily, while white has a nice line for his lsb. one knight down, three to go. two knights down, two more to go! i'm loving life right now. i simply don't like them. the white lsb opens up his look and gives white the option to castle. protects the h7 pawn and the d5 pawn... the f6 knight is overloaded. however, i am prepared to exchange if i can manage it! now white loads the b1-h7 diagonal gun. in addition, opens the option to castle long (albeit unattractive) attack queen side... threatens the b2 pawn, which keeps the queen busy for a few moves. gives black the initiative and white has not yet castled.  black could exchange queens here, but chose nd2 instead. this move pins the knight. i am expecting the h3 kick in the next move or so. not much more the queen can do here. by forcing the knight into defense, i think she's done enough. attack king side. i didn't want white to castle long, his pawns are slightly better positioned for a pawn storm.  natural i thought about bringing the bishop to g6, but will need some additional help back there and the queen is awaiting her next mission white mobilizes on the queen side preparing to attack the weak pawns there. queen pulling extra defensive duty: defending d5, c5 and helping defend the kingside in subtle ways.   i see the potential of ng4 & qh2, but that's unlikely given a highly likely h3 pawn push.   i also imagine one future with a black rook at e8 and the queen at e6. the black queen is in a nimble position. i like this position for her. she is highly mobile and capable of playing both sides.  white steals my idea, but he's several moves ahead there... that looks strong simple, yet powerful, defensive move. relieves the black queen for other duty and stalls the white queen.   notice that white has amassed all his major and minor pieces on the queen side. the black king looks a bit vulnerable now. i'm feeling comfortable with the black side. i feel the piece spread is solid with many pieces working in harmony and an active queen. anticipated as earlier discussed. this stops the ng4 plan.  time to mess with that bishop. i know i'll end with doubled pawns (which become a factor later in the game), but i think having the rook staring down the f file is interesting. maybe there's a discovered attack there with a knight move in the future.  takes takes. doubling the pawns and weakens the castle. however, the bishops are off the board, so the only piece that can threaten the king diagonally is the queen, which the d5 pawn holds at bay.  i hate knights put the queen where i envisioned her earlier. i know in this position the knight must move twice to threaten the queen and defends the b pawn simultaneously. and the pawn storm on the queen side begins. will prepare to double my rooks up on the f file. the f file is now my attack plan. the queen is not well positioned yet, i would like to move the knight up to e4 (blocking the queen and pressuring f2), then maybe g2.  pawn attack alert.. that's a problem i'll have to deal with. c3 is the weak spot. it's clear white will push forward on the queen side. all his major pieces are prepared and in good position. however, back to my earlier note. this leaves his king side a bit weaker.   my attack plan is still along the f file. however, while i’ve learned keeping to a strategy is certainly a good idea, small tangents are often necessary to dismantle or interrupt an opponent's plan. in this case, i want to perturb the threat building on the queen side. i still intend on doubling my rooks on f, but put a minor threat on his queen while defending the c6 pawn.  move the knight out of harms way and opens up the queen-rook attack on c3. i only have two defenders, but they i think i will win the exchange still.  discovered attack on f2 and positions the black knight in excellent position. i really don't like knights, with their strange and mysterious way, but i think this one is in pretty good position. white cannot easily contest the black knight.  threatens an eventual white queen centered at d5. not sure my plan to interrupt the queen side attack was effective. it seems my opponent is committed there.. perhaps this is something i should use. the black pawn at a7 does look weak, but its not clear how the final attack will form there. white still has the f2 attack, but that's not really that powerful yet. i think if i put more pressure there white will have to react and slow the queen side attack. so back to my f file attack plan. double the rooks, double the fun! i basically abandoned the queen side pawns and committed to a king side attack. i didn't do the math, but think the queen side pawns can fend off the queen side attack while my king side attack solidifies.  this move by white maintains his attack on the queen side and additionally defends f2. at this point, i really don’t know if my king side attack will work. the next move seems to be qh4, which will commit me to king side and weaken my queen side defense. i spent a lot of time analyzing this position. now, because white moved the rook to c2, this tells me the king side attack has some merit. this provides a bit more confidence.  so, black attacks. the black queen is no longer supporting the queen side pawns, but they don't seem in imminent danger.   the pressure is quite high on both sides of the board. on the queen side, the pawn storm is well underway with a strong supporting cast ready to invade black’s territory. on the king side, black is preparing an attack at the f2 cell. the white pawns on the kingside appear to be fixed, while the black pawns on the queen side are in the same condition.   the difference from both sides appears to be that white’s major pieces provide both attacking and defending support, while black’s strong pieces are mostly committed to the attack on the king side. if i’m committed to this attack, black needs to add another piece to the mix. the king side pawns are pretty useless in their current state. i think moving one of these into the mix would be good.. just seems a bit too slow. white's queen side attack begins. if black exchanges on b5, the queen side defenses are done. in fact, i don’t see a pawn move on the queen side that doesn’t result in a total defensive breakdown. also, at this point my opponent and i were discussing the pawn structure. he also pointed out my king side pawns are doubled. he sees this as a weakness as well.  i decide to advance the king side attack further and simultaneoulsy try to resolve the doubled pawns. i considered h5 and h6, as this gives my king a place to run when the white pawns reach the rear rank (which appears inevitable), but neither supports the black attack. the only pawn move that participates in the f attack is the leading g pawn.  white continues on the queen side. the defenses have been breached. black can’t afford to let the pawn pass. this exchange is logical as the white rook on c2 is fixed to defend against the f2 attack.  i didn’t expect this capture. i thought white would double the rooks on c. this seems to opens the door for an  attack at f2.  so black takes on f2. my opponent indicated a queen exchange here may have been better, but he doesn't know i really just wanted to get rid of the knights!!! one more down, only one more to go! finally.. the knights are gone and now i'm threatening the queen. i spent a while analyzing the position and forgot about the d5 pawn threat. this changes things for black. the queen side is entirely breached and two very strong pieces running amok uncontested. i must come up with an alternate offensive approach. but first, i need to move out of check  :) now white doubles the rooks. this moves threatens checkmate unless the white queen stays on the the diagonal, somewhat limiting the white queen's movement. white intent on pushing forward with the d pawn trying to line up the rook, then the queen and pawn on e3. white has forced the exchange. i didn't see this coming either. black choices are qb8 (and lose the rook) or exchange. any other move is results in checkmate.  black makes the only viable move. black takes at least i was able to even out the material.  white defends his pawns i decide to exchange. i've read more complex positions favor the stronger player, so my goal is now to simplify. white takes. the d pawn is my concern now. if that pawn is out of the way, perhaps the imbalance on the king side can result in a positive result for black. making room for the black king and moving the pawns forward. yea, that's the one. i counted the moves and the black king can beat him. looked like a waiting move maybe, but lined up the white pawns. pinned the d pawn the black a pawn is gone. now, black has to worry about the white a pawn. takes i decide to keep the black king from participating moving out of the way for the pawn. i wanted to bring the king up so he doesn't trap my king on the last rank. i'm hoping the king will participate in a pawn promotion. yikes. attack that puppy. white could have moved the pawn forward, but this move keeps the black king constrained for a move. it also fixes the black rook along the a file and the white rook along the 6th row. i really want my king involved mr. white chess guy. check uncheck yikes!!! time to attack the pawns and try to promote one. take take i didn't expect this move, the final pawn exchange would result in a draw. so, i look very carefully. white has set a trap with h4. its a game ending move for black, do you see it?  not interested in ending the game (kh5 results in checkmate), i decide to move the pawn forward. take take and i think maybe i can march the pawn up the board to promote. however, if you count carefully, it won't work.  white moves to intercept the black rook moved the king to start walking from here, i'll skip ahead a bit because we are pretty much even. this is the first potential draw position. my opponent has determined at this point, the a7 pawn is irrelevant to the draw, so we make a couple of moves and then draw. we agreed to draw at this point. i'm very pleased with my progress in this game and thank the club for advancing my game so rapidly. i will also say that during this game, i got very little sleep and spent a long time analyzing these positions. so... its off to bed!   hope you enjoyed the annotation and please leave your comments.  thanks david for the game!

i opened d3.    black opens bringing out his kingside knight.  i bring out another pawn in hopes to controlling the center. this is considered book. black plays book and is attacking my pawn i take his pawn and am now attacking his knight. this is book. this is my third move and i have not developed a minor piece. playing too many pawn moves could end up getting me doubled pawns in an exchange. so far i feel i have played book and am up a pawn. black has to move his knight again due my pawn. i develop my first minor piece.  knight takes knight.   i  retake the knight with my pawn and now have doubled pawns and a pawn on e5 that is unprotected. with this move i still have  all my pawns, neither of us have developed minor pieces.  black has developed his dsb and it has a nice look at my f2 pawn. i play yet another pawn to e3 thinking this will protect me from the dsb. this is not the best move i could of played something better, developing a minor piece would have been better.   black develops a knight. i don't think he was too worried in castling just yet. plus this way he attacks my unprotected hanging e5 pawn i develop my knight to protect my center pawn. i was about to f4 to protect the pawn, could that of been a better move? now black castles kingside.  i bring out my lsb as far as it can go. my pawns on the c-file are doubled up and i am wondering if i will ever get  to move them in this game.    black's queen peeks out to e7. i have moved my lsb again. i wanted to develop my dsb but it had only 1 move. i think castling here would have been a better move. knight takes pawn. i decide it's time to introduce my queen into the game. a better move was to exchange knight's. d6  protects the knight.  i moved the wrong bishop. blunder: -5.27 » 12. bb2 rd8 13. bxh7+ kxh7 14. qe4+ g6 15. o-o bf5 16. qf3 bd3 17. rfd1 e4 18. qh3+ kg7 19. qg4 bxc4 20. a4 rd6 21. rxd6 cxd6 22. rd1 best: -1.36 » 12. bc2 rd8 13. qf3 c6 14. rb1 rb8 15. qg3 qf6 16. o-o be6 17. bb3 e4 18. rd1 qxc3 19. bb2 rxd1+ 20. rxd1 rook to d-file attacking my queen.  bxh7+ i decide to put black in check with my lsb. at least if black takes with his king. i can move my queen out of danger.    qe4+ weak check, but able to move my queen from attack. i retreat my queen  pinned is the f5 pawn for now. black develops lsb. move my rook next to my king.   rxd1+ rook takes rook.  king takes rook, i decided not to take with my queen thinking i would make my king safer queen side.   black brings out his queen as a defender.  blunder: -10.84 » 19. f4 qg4+ 20. kc1 bxe3+ 21. kb1 bd5 22. rd1 be4 23. rd3 qh3 24. bc1 qf1 25. rxe3 bxc2+ 26. kxc2 exf4 27. re5 fxg3 28. hxg3 best: -6.45 » 19. kc1 rd8 20. rd1 rxd1+ 21. qxd1 bxa2 22. qa4 bd5 23. qd7 bd6 24. qb5 be4 25. qa5 b6 26. qxa7 qg4 qg4+ blunder: -mate(2) » 23. qxe4 qxd1+ 24. bc1 qxc1# best: -13.54 » 23. rd3 exf4 24. bc1 fxg3 25. h3 qg6 26. bxe3 f4 27. kc1 bxd3 28. qd2 fxe3 29. qxe3 bf1 30. qf3 bxh3 31. qxb7  qxd1+ i block the check but the damage is done.  mate (1)  qxc1#   checkmate   the end!   hope to hear from all who wish to discuss this game!

classical qgd (queen's gambit declined) opening. still in use even at the highest levels i personally favour c5 here (before nc6) to open up the centre to prevent an annoying break-in of the white knight, and to solidify a possible queen-side pawn rush a bold advance; not bad but a3 might have been more careful. or then developing a bishop the route via b4 is now possible for this knight (which is why 6. a3 had been better) this move has little purpose. the white bishops sit an stare at the movement! finally, a white bishop is out. both players castle and the other bishop a sound move preventing interventions via g4, and paving the way for a possible pawn ruch on the k-side later frees the rook interplay on the 8th row and prepares for q-side attack rb1 is understandable, but unnecessary. a developing move such as bd3 had been better. if black had then taken the b pawn, his queen would have quickly been in trouble. 13. bd3 qxb2 14. a5 excellent move! a good move again. the alternative had been to take hold of the c-file (15. rc1); if 15....qxb2 16. na4 and black loses the knight  this is all right, but a rook exchange at c8 was an alternative black is up in material and the exchange is warranted yes! much better than 18. bxc1 the position here is fairly even, i think, with some black advantage due to better development 19. qc3? is the move that soon leads to white's downfall, for reasons to be seen in a moment. perhaps the best move for white had been 19. nc5 attacking on the q-side and threatening to exchange black's dsb note that 20. bxc4 dxc4 21. qxc4 leads to 21.....b5  but it is this move (20. b3) that loses. white fails to note the danger of the unprotected e4 square available to the other black knight this leads to a minimum loss of white's dsb, which is protected only by the queen (who is now herself under attack). white resigns. i think white played very well up to the last two mistrakes indicated, which could have been avoided by some more careful analysis à la id=elyhim 
-------------------------------------
gambit accepted i usually play c3 for a danish gambit. joanne opts to defend her advanced pawn. ... which white takes defending the knight glenda is on tour white occupates the center but there is a big amount of black pressure on it. the most aggressive move. to prepare a fiancheto king in safe black can castle on both sides menacing fork attack by 10. bc7 i was sure that black wouldn't dare to castle long with the many white pieces aiming at this side. to prevent 10. ... bxe3 11. fxe3 with double isolated pawns for white and to weaken black's king weakening the king. only place for the knight threatening the knight not a very good place for a knight but there was no choice. i hesitated a long time before electing this move. the other candidates moves where 13. qe2 13. qb3 13. nb3 but black would probably have traded his e kight against the bishop and, in this particular position, i thought that the lsb would be usefull to attack the black queen, so that it shouldn't be traded. black plays very agressively. i first looked for a defensive move and felt very annoyed :  if 14. exd4 rxd4 if 14. qa4 d4. finally i remember that "la meilleure défense c'est l'attaque"... ... it weakens the king but black has no dsb anylonger, so that i considered it as no to dangerous for me. the plan is to develop, chasing the black queen so that black cannot regain the initiative for long. i remembered that  joanne had trapped dame genievre one game ago, and thought it was nothing but justice to hunt her lady. go, dog ! go ! the servant knight has to flee black has little available moves for g5, and d5 are under white's control f5 and f6 lose the queen by 16 g4. h4 is not safe. black has 15. ... qb6 or 15. ... qc6 or can take with the knight, losing some material but opening white's center. another candidate move was 15. f5 but i didn't see how to carry on after. so "go dog ! go" that (in my opinion at least) was the best square for black to go and i was not to happy about this move. but i was ready for it. white sends a powerfull defender. black counterattacks on the kingside. long hesitation before playing this move because i have to sacrify the e pawn but white's plan is still to chase the queen. strenghtening black center and taking material advantage both pawn structures are bad but the black one is even worse. escaping the danger only move fork attack between queen and e pawn. good move from black. white has now little attacking possibilities and black can quickly be very dangerous with 21. ... nxd5 22. ... nxe5 or 21. ... bxd5 menacing 22. ... bxg2 etc. after a long hesitation, i opt for this move. black is forced to take. the main advantage is to create an open file in b. without queen and with knights in this position, black will have trouble to defend b7. the white king, in contrary, is in safety because black has no more pièces to menace the black diagonal a7g1. of course, this move has the drawback to isolate the a  white pawn. forced move. the b file is opened and it will, further in the game, be the main theater of operations. protecting e5 pinning the lsb unpinning the lsb. white has strong attacking possibilities toward the king. black is one pawn less. the situation is very opened with bad pawn structures on both sides, white controls the 2 open lines, although, in both lines, black limitates the possibilities of move of the rooks with her pawns or knight, the black king is weaker than the white one (poor henry !), the center is contested. i saw no way to directly attack the king. i was surprised because it was none of the answers i imagined. as such a situation favorises the tactics and joanne is rated far higher than me, i felt very unsafe. i saw 4 candidate moves : rxf8 which my able opponent had surely taken into account, c4 which secured and blocked the center, probably leading to a draw, bf3 which achieves little and nac4 preparing an attack upon the king. it seemed the best move to cary on fighting for the victory. i finally choose rf8 to prepare the following attack, eliminating one defenseur on the 8 line to prepare 26. nac8 now black controls one of the open files the other candidate move was c4 but it blocked the situation, the knight on c 4 menaces b6 and e5, it seemed to be better to conduct an attack. joanne could have counterattacked by nxd5 or bxd5 but she chooses to defend, preventing bf3 so that white must find another way to attack. almost  forced (the e knight had no proper place to go and the passed pawn would have been dangerous). trading a pawn and attacking the bishop doubtfull move, 28. ... bc6 might have been better but i'm not sure (this i wrote during the game but finally it proved efficient. all white forces are aiming at the black king and at this moment, i tought that i had a winning game. good move. to menace 31. nd7 with menace on the black rook but 30. na5 would probably have been better, menacing the lsb.  counterattacking i couldn't find any other move, so that i initiated a trading sequence. i thought we were heading to a draw but black is one pawn ahead and has one passed pawn. trading horse trading white has little choice. trading the rooks now white must be very carefull to obtain a draw. with a passed pawn (and the white a2 pawn under direct menace, white plays for a win). black must think that the less, the merrier in an endgame with one pawn more no choice at least, that one is blocked. white's plan is to block the a file with the lonesome rider and to take the e pawn with the king. 2 pawns ahead but i still had hope to block all the black pieces. to come in e3 and take the pawn. to block the lonesome rider's advance. during a time, i thought the situation was desperate. the survivor will go to a1 in time. going for a ride. avoiding the indian's ambushes on the way good place to be. white has to block all the pawns and all the passages that henri may use... done for the a, b,c and d file. now, let's organise the right side. black blocks the lonesome rider and protect the e pawn. "no passaran" "beware, everybody", king henri is coming.  just hope i didn't miss anything. the black king can come on that way. it's impossible to fully block this side but i estimated that there was still a chance for white. "you shall not pass" tempting but if 45. kxg5 e3 and glenda reappears on the board 2 moves later. no choice to defend the pass no choice to prevent 49. kg4 now white situation is desperate but i still want to try something. the place to be for the very last chance. blocking the pawn of course black doesn't take last trap. joanne is too wise and clever to fall into such a trap (if 58. ... bxb1 stalemate) if black takes, stalemate white submits here. well done joanne and thanks for an interesting game.

miglior risposta sarebbe stata ng1-f3 meglio era 5. c4 bb4+ 6. bd2 qe7 questa mossa assicura g5 al nero, una posizione scomoda per l'alfiere bianco in f4. era meglio qh5+ obbligando la risposta risposta del nero con nf7 qe2 era una risposta più bilanciata. il nero avrebbe risposto con qb6. la successiva mossa del bianco con nf2 teneva il cioco ancora aperto. a questo punto il nero ha occupato una casella base sulla scacchiera. la partita può considerarsi chiusa. dopo lo scambio il nero è in poltrona... :-) la mossa è giusta. infatti se: 21. nxd4 bb5 22. rc1 qxd4+ 23. qxqd4 rxqd4 24. fxg5 ng4 25. rxf5 bxd3 la qualitâ del materiale sul campo è chiaramente a favoree del nero forse sarebbe stato meglio giocare 23. na3 bxa3 24. bxa3 ne3 anche giocando ora na3 non è possibile cambiare l'andamento della partita. infatti dopo 25. na3 ne3 26. rd2 bxa3 27. ra5xba3 rc8 va bene come mossa. anche bh3 non avrebbe impedito th7-g7  questa è una mossa di asescamento. infatti se 31. nxb4 tce7+ e la torre bianca è persa forzare b4 non sarebbe stato sbagliato. 33. b4 bxb4 34. bf1 a copertura del cavallo, re7+ 35. kf3 mossa da knockout 36. g4 non aiuterebbe molto di più ne5 non serve a niente il bianco ha abbandonato 
-------------------------------------
this game deals with the exchange sacrifice - one of the most difficult and challenging aspects of modern chess. most commonly it involves an exchange of a rook for a bishop or a knight - either for a direct attack or for positional reasons. the kings indian is still one of the best choices for black, if he wants a dynamic game with good attacking possibilities on the king-side. a very rare line indeed! the move is more flexible than it looks. first of all, it takes away a lot of squares from black´s c8-bishop. in case of a white bishop-move to e3, it can´t be attacked by a black knight-move to g4 - and if white should decide to castle long, he has the move g4 in hand with an attack on the black king. i don´t think this is black´s best option. attacking the centre with pawn-moves like c5 or e5 seems more active. a bit of a "luxury"-move, but nb4 by black could be annoying. closing the centre, but also creating long-term problems when it comes to activating the bishop on g7. white´s bishop on d3 is not much worth either at the moment, but it gets new life when play moves to one of the flanks. this leads to the exchange sacrifice, and i must admit, that i had no idea if it would do the trick or not. many of these sac.´s are played more by "gut feeling" than long calculations. a very nice move, challenging the sacrifice. !? after 19. - axb5 20. nxb5, white has plenty of play against the pawns on c5 and e5 plus a potentially dangerous passed pawn on d5. my feeling was that white had more than sufficient compensation for the exchange, but absolutely nothing is clear yet! the pawn on b7 will tie down black´s pieces for a while and give time for re-grouping. now 22. - rxa3 could be answered by 23. qb2 with a double-threat of nb5 or promoting the pawn. black desperately needs to find some counterplay, or white´s two queenside pawns will decide the game. threats the nasty fork 26. nf7  even with the queens off, black is still under a lot of pressure, and his pieces are not well co-ordinated. now another pawn has to go. in this kind of position it becomes clear why a rook can be a terrible defender. white takes final control over the promotion-square b8, which will cost black at least a piece. therefore black chose to resign. i hope this game will inspire you to look more for the option of the exchange sacrifice. if it works, it is a great weapon! 
-------------------------------------
this was an odd game in many ways... nothing much happened from the opening, then came the move of the "wrong" rook, and suddenly we ended up with a classical mate that i guess all chess-players dreams about. from the english opening we have reached the semi-slav. it normally calls for slow maneouvering, and has been very popular in top-level chess for a while. maybe this development of the "bad" bishop is too early. i would rather prepare for the castling with bd3. looks a bit strange, since black has lost a tempo with c7-c6 and now c5. but white hasn´t gained anything from the opening, and there are no immediate threats. maybe we could call it a "centre-counter" ! for some moves black could have chosen the isolated pawn on d5 instead. it can be strong - or just a looser. mostly it depends on wether it gets blockaded efficiently or not. in this case i think the two white knights will do what it takes, so i decide to retreat my own knight and keep the game in balance. the wrong rook! i have read so many commentaries by danish gm bent larsen on this theme... in this case it is not the rook but the plan which is the problem. white wants to answer 15. qc7 with 16. rac1, so the black queen only has the active goal at b6 for the moment. the plan then is to chase the black queen with e4 and be3, but the lack of support of the pawn on f2 becomes critical. this is the point. after 17. be1 bf6 black has a very good middle-game. whites next two moves doesn´t make much sense, but leads to what could have been a beautiful finish. of course i hoped for 19. kh1 qg1 !! 20. rxg1 (or nxg1) nf2#... but my opponent decided to resign. 
-------------------------------------
the major theme of this game is the strength of the bishop pair in an open position. the accelerated dragon ... not the most common way to play the sicilian at present, but a player like bent larsen have used it quite often throughout his career. one big difference from the "normal" dragon is, that black hasn´t played his pawn to d6 yet. in some lines this gives the opportunity to play it to d5 directly - like in this game. if you want to study this opening, i can recommend the book "the sicilian accelerated dragon" by gm peter heine nielsen and carsten hansen. another main line here is the maroczy bind: 5. c4. black can still choose the traditional dragon by playing 8. - d6, but now the d5-push is possible. the last few moves has been more or less forced. now 12. - nxe4 13. fxe4 is about equal, though i think black´s isolated pawn at c6 is a bit weaker than white´s on e4. i had another plan: to win the exchange ... exploiting the fact that both white´s king and rook are on the h6-c1 diagonal. black wins the exchange, but my opponent had looked far deeper into the resulting middlegame. !! black needs to chase the knight on e4 away. if instead 14. - nb6, white can play 15. bxe7 with the nasty threat 16. nf6 . once again a strong move by white. if 16. - cxd5?? 17. bxd5 , and the rook on a8 are doomed. if we only look on the material, black is better - but white´s bishops rules the board, he has a dangerous pawn at c6, and is ahead in development. as we shall see, this is more than enough compensation. black has been more or less forced to close in his own bishop on c8. now white is preparing to create double passed pawns on the queenside of the board - eventually winning the game. mission accomplished! black has no counterplay against the exposed white king, since the bishops are covering almost everything around it. my last hope is that white will push the pawns prematurely, so i can sacrifice my bishop for both of them. if  then i can trade off the last pawn on h2, there should be good chances to hold the game to a draw. ! ... now the additonal threat to the pawn-promotion is 29. rg1   followed by all kinds of disaster around g6. trading off the rooks would be immediate resignation, but now white tugs in his king comfortably on c3 and goes for the kill. the end ... next comes 32. b7, and black will loose. what a great bishop pair! 
-------------------------------------
 the game is notable for how long it is. what is the longest game you have ever played dear reader? where do you go for your holidays? i love going to warmington-on-sea chess tournaments. we play a move a day. 9am start. we have two hours each on our chess clocks, for 48 moves each. if it is not finished, we get 2 more hours each, adjourn for lunch and then play to a finish after lunch. i was amused to find myself drawn against a certain span-ki-moon. i was even more surprised when i met my opponent. she stood about 5’ 7” tall with jet black hair all the way down her back, with big brown eyes and skin so golden it seemed like a tan. when she smiled she had the most perfect teeth and lips i ever seen. she was dressed in the tightest blue jeans you could picture and a tee shirt that was skin tight. she was lovely! "are you related to ban ki-moon i asked?" half joking. "no, he's from south korea and i am from thailand" she replied. "bangkok?" i asked her. "no, i'm not kind of girl" she smiled in reply. we exchanged a hand shake. her hands were small and dainty and beautifully manicured. they felt soft and inviting. we held hands for just a moment longer than normal. it went through my mind how nice it would be to walk with her, holding that hand. i was a bit entranced by her, as we rattled the first few moves. aha! entering the benoni-benko complex of openings. it was slightly off-putting playing her. the strong smell of her sweet perfume. this beautifully manicured hands reaching over the board..... this move is probably necessary to prevent white from playing d6 nc3 prepares e4 and i call this the czech benoni, also sometimes known as the hromadka benoni. the czech benoni is much more solid than the modern benoni, but it is also more passive. likely to lead to a long, slow, manoeuvring game. perfect! it is possible for black to also develop the bishop to g7. she looked at me with a little glee in her eye as she played this move. surely she didn't think i would overlook an attack on my queen? i quickly played f3. and then i realised. my white squared bishop now would have very little scope. she clearly had brains as well as beauty! but i wasn't going to just sit around all day. let's attack her b pawn. i was out of my opening theory now, and thinking for myself. mmm there almost seems to be an offer of a draw here. if i take on b7 she has nb4. 10. kd1 rb8 11. qxa7 ra8 12. qb7 rb8 and a sort of perpetual check on my queen. now do i want to end this game with this stunning beauty opposite me? not blinking likely! let's see, a3 renews the threat of queen takes b7
-------------------------------------
testing the budapest. something has to block the check.  if qxd2, ng4 all the same. but it was better for white.  it comes to mind qh4 (pinning the pawn to the rook). i didn't because of g3. in that case, to mantain the pin will cost several tempos to black, and i won't get much (by experience).  f4 is disastrous for white, so this seems safe.  uff, just a "shot in the dark". i should have castled first.  any attempt to defend the knight seems to fail, and nxn just helps him, so... ...aware of qxq+ to come.  this because there are no queens on the board, an white misses his dsb.  foreseen.  now, nd7 will just lose the knight. black's position is not all too bad (white is still better).  i have to play with great care, stopping the "holes" everywhere in my position. if bf5, nc5.  now i have a shadow of a grimp on d3. i'll try to exploit this.  the knight has to retreat, "losing" control of d3.  very well, since if white allows nxf2, nxc7 is not a match, because of the opening of the c column... now the position is not too unbalanced. white has to fight with an exchange down... it was tempting to keep the diagonal, but after e4 it will be closed all the same.  i have to control the white pieces. and i don't have to exchange the lsb, if possible.  preparing e5. this gives me a tempo, since is only half dangerous (kxf6 is possible provided the rook can't penetrate).  go back.  just to remove the bishop from the diagonal. not inmediately b5, because of nc5. "be patient..." preparing to activate my last piece.  there are 3 ways to react: to take, to advance and to wait.  white's best piece is now a headache.  good (i would have played nb4, but bc4 would be the answer). white's weakness will be felt soon.  just "crazy". i wanted to disrupt white's pawns, so i can take them later.  ok, but this gets the king into a cage.  this was not the best move, for sure.  yes, ok. and the h pawn is hanging, i know.  i could have given the h pawn. i have something on the queenside.  just controlling the knight.  !? not a good choice, since it opens the way for my lsb to c4.  if bb3, bxb, and my a pawn becomes a serious threat.  using the same tactic, but it won't work, now.  opening the column. i'm winning, i can feel it.  better and better. i have a rook on the right column, now... ...and still i have it. bxa2 is deadly. but white has other plans.  i just can't allow nxh2+, so... ...aware of the rook penetration. but if i can survive this, my force on c will prevail.  the "trick" is that white... cant' attack h2 with the bishop.  ...i can allow myself this.  threatening mate in one, but better would have been nxh7.  et voilà, white's attack is stopped.  bxa2+, kxa2, rxb, ok, but then... i'll lose the rook or the a pawn. but the right attack (imo) is... of course, forcing white to defend (if the bishop moves, rc1# - i like my pawn!.... re2, only one, but then bxa2 becomes possible. white lost by timeout. i think white is lost, but... what do you think? 
-------------------------------------
this was my opening game in a minitournament consisting of teammates from waskally wabbits and morose mooses. i decided to annotate all my games from the competition, as this would also help me to focus more on my games and hopefully cut out most blunders. i can't promise scintillating play, as i'm not that kind of a player. :)   my opponent, blackbaron, is my most frequent opponent on gameknot, and i played against him in my very first minitournament in this site. we usually have very exciting games with a lot of exchanges early on, so let's see how this one goes.   he starts with 1.e4. my personal favourite, pawn moves to the centre, and frees two pieces, the light squared bishop and the queen. my usual defence against 1.e4 is the french defence. 1.... c5. the sicilian, my current preferred opening against 1. e4. i had a pretty good run with the french, and will return to it soon. tried the pirc for a while, with horrible results. record with the french : 50%, record with the pirc : 35%.  have recently ordered the book play the french by john watson (just arrived today, in fact. takes 12 days for amazon.com to deliver to bangladesh, for anyone who might be interested) :) . will switch back to the french after i study the book for a while. normal development, moves the knight to its best square, and follows the rule : knights before bishops, as we know what the best squares are for the knights, whereas it is better to wait a bit before developing the bishop. this move frees my light squared bishop. i plan to play the sicilian dragon, so while my king side bishop looks horribly locked in, i 'm not too worried.  i plan to fianchetto the bishop. the fianchettoed bishop failed miserably for me in the pirc defence, let's see how the dragon suits my style. unorthodox move, no idea if this move is in the book, will have to check later after the game what the best response is. for now, will have to follow my instincts. perhaps he is planning to fianchetto his own bishop, to prevent me from playing g6 for the dragon formation. normal development, knight to its best square. if he fianchettoes his bishop to counter my dragon, i'll still continue with my plan, i fancy the early exchange which wins his bishop for my knight. 4. e5. typically aggressive play by the baron, but has he overlooked something? i can play 4.... dxe5, which wins a pawn, because if 5. nxe5?, i can play 5..... qd4! which forks the knight and rook. let's wait and see though. awaiting his response... he has overlooked it! how will he defend this? give away the rook, as a sort of poisoned rook, if there is such a thing, and attempt to trap my queen? for example, 6. nc4  qxa1, 7. bb2  qxa2, 8. nc3 qa6 and so on. or even 7. nc3 which looks better. let's wait and see. of course, trapping my queen is one thing, capturing it with no further loss of material is something else entirely :) actually, i was expecting this, kxf7 looks safe, and worth the extra piece. possible responses from the baron? bc4 looks plausible. note the placement of my knight, by choosing to develop it early to it's best square, it prevents my opponent's queen from playing threatening queen moves such as qa5 or qg4. the knight defends beautifully from there. as predicted. too late for me to react to this now, as it's way past midnight, and i have to get up early for work tomorrow. to be continued. protecting the king with the e pawn. white could castle and bring his rook into play on the half open file, but my pawn is backed by the bishop, and i could bring a piece or two out myself by then. i wanted to avoid a move like ke1 because it would leave my king too exposed protects the rook, and develops a piece. reasons for this move : develops a piece; the game is very open, and the player with better development should have the advantage. also, it takes me a step closer to 'castling by hand' and takes my king to safety. i would have loved to have been able to play ng4, but there's a time and a place for everything. possible threats now : nb5 i can deal with, qf3 gives me time to bring out my h1 rook, qe2 could have been a worry, but my bishop at c1 is nicely placed to deal with that.  9. qf3. let's see, pins the knight, and prevents my light squared bishop from moving, with an eye on my b7 pawn. that's always a thing to remember when your opponent plays a queen move, it can threaten multiple pieces or squares simultaneously, and it's easy to miss out sometimes. the knight is well protected for the moment, and i could play nbd2 if necessary, developing my qside knight in the process. i could try qe5 , to ease the pressure a bit, and see how my opponent reacts. he would most likely block the check with his bishop, giving me time to bring out my rook and continue with my original plan of castling by hand. 10. be2, as expected. my queen move also prevents white from castling, as o-o would be followed by qxh2 . time to bring my rook into play, but where? one of the two half open files (f and d), or re8? i choose rf8, as it allows nd5 (after i take my king to safety), which threatens white's knight currently protecting the queenside rook, while simultaneously attacking white’s queen with my rook. i need to watch out for any discovered attacks on my queen now. but how soon do i need to respond to this threat? do i have time to tuck away my king? what's the worst the knight can do? and most importantly, the bishop itself is unprotected, so a discovered attack may not be on the cards just yet. another motive could be that my opponent plans to castle queenside, and use a pawn storm to tear up whatever protection i have left for my king. i don't like this at all. safety first, the king looks better protected, and i manage to unpin my knight. must start preparing my response to o-o-o. 12.o-o-o. let's see how this changes things. white's fianchettoed bishop is now protected, and can threaten my queen. let's see what my options are. i have three pieces that i haven't developed at all, not a good idea in such an open game. the bishop and rook can't really move, and are running out of oxygen. nc6 looks like the only developing move. but what if 12… nc6?  13. nb5. among other options, an exchange of queens would suit me fine, will have to find ways to force it. something like qf4 would be a step in that direction, and would also take my queen out of the range of white's annoying darksquared bishop. but should i go for that now, with so many pieces still undeveloped?  in the end, i settle for qf4. getting white's queen out of the game, or even forcing it to move away from the h1-a8 diagonal would allow me to develop my pieces. of course, white still has the option of replacing the queen on that diagonal with his lightsquared bishop. exchange of queens suits me fine, as i am a piece ahead. also reduces the pressure that was being exerted on my queen side pieces. now let's see if the bishop replaces the queen on the long diagonal. bishop must move, but what is the best square? keeping it on this diagonal would be useful, as it prevents white from pushing the d-pawn. however, bg5 or bh6 could easily be blocked off with f4. in response, i could try nbd2 followed by e5. worth a try. i was afraid of that. well, time to open things up a bit more, something along the lines of 16...e5  17 fxe5 nxe5 which gives me some breathing space and gets rid of my isolated e-pawn. i don't like this. next up i suppose he'll support it with g4. i'll take measures to advance my pawn anyway. i'm not too happy with my position, my extra piece hasn't meant anything so far, must get to the endgame quickly. threatening my f6 knight, which is well protected by my knight on d2. i now have to find a way to prevent nc7 which forks my rooks. i chose to exchange knights, as : it takes me closer to the endgame with two more pieces off the board, and i can now use my other knight as the blockader at f6.  where should i move my king? i chose kf8, as i was worried about the possibility of being cornered by the two bishops. now my knight move nf6 looks nice, forks white's bishop and pawn, and blocks the f pawn. one thing to keep in mind is a future g5 by baron, which will fork my bishop and knight. so that when i play e4, if baron tries bxf6, i can retake with my bishop and replace one blockader with another. what's next, g5? that will weaken the f5 pawn though. makes it possible to advance the d pawn, my bishops are beginning to look less useful, i really haven't taken advantage of my extra piece. baron's knight sacrifice brought my king out, and i've been under pressure since. looks like a clumsy and awkward move, but i can't think of anything better at the moment. advance the b pawn next, and try to exchange the light squared bishops. thought so, the blockader must move now. nd7, and i wait for baron's next move. his f pawn is hanging. if he brings it forward, the exchange gives him a passed pawn that is well advanced. protect my own hanging pawn. it seems to me as though i've been reacting to baron's moves for a long time, rather then setting up some threats of my own. hopefully things will change when my queenside pieces enter the play. new plan, will attack the lightly protected f pawn with a discovered attack, next move rf8 continuing with my plan, but i'm expecting baron to play f6. exchange of pawns, my king's exposed, not good. return the knight to d7, and then start advancing my queenside pawns? the knight does provide added protection to my isolated e pawn though. i'm seriously thinking about sacrificing a piece here, the knight, if it eases the pressure on my king. for example, 29... nf6. 30. gxf6   rxf6. this could win white's f pawn for me as well, so i'd be a pawn ahead, with a kingside pawn majority, and closer to the end game. but what are my opponent's options? if he decides to advance his pawn rather than take my knight, that suits me too, as i can exchange my knight for his bishop and retain my piece advantage. i'll go for it. awaiting baron's response…in hindsight, a better move may have been b6, but i was worried about the way my opponent's pawns were storming my already weakened king side defence.  i win the pawn, but how do i respond to bxe5? will the resulting exchanges be favourable for me? i notice the chance for the stalemate, and go for it. i apologise for the anticlimax. my endgame is my weakest point, it would have been good practice to continue, on the other hand, i was under a lot of pressure for a very long period, and was relieved with the draw. draw, we share the points. i had an extra pawn, with a kingside pawn advantage, but i was under pressure from my opponent from a very early stage, and was relieved to get the 1/2.

dopo tre tentativi falliti con i pezzi bianchi, sergey karjakin decide che ne ha abbastanza con 1.e4. dopo tutto, carlsen era quello che ha deciso il tipo di apertura nella prima metà della partita così lo sfidante deve aver sentito una certa pressione per cambiare le cose. nei loro precedenti incontri, karjakin ha giocato 1.d4 solo tre volte contro il campione del mondo. già carlsen si differenzia dalla sua scelta di apertura giocata a bilbao. sicuramente karjakin non può ripetere la combinazione giocata allora perché magnus sarebbe in grado di rigiocare la stessa partita senza molto stress. (1... nf6 2. c4 e6 3. nf3 d5 4. nc3 bb4 5. qa4+ nc6 6. e3 o-o 7. qc2 re8 8. bd2 a6 9. a3 bd6 10. h3 bd7 11. cxd5 exd5 12. bd3 na7 13. qb3 c6 14. qxb7 nb5 15. nxb5 axb5 16. ne5 rb8 17. qa6 ra8 18. qb7 rb8 19. qa6 ra81/2-1/2 (19) karjakin,s (2773)-carlsen,m (2855) bilbao 2016)  . entriamo nel slava, generalmente considerata una solida apertura per il nero. il bianco spesso sviluppa con più facilità e spera di creare punti deboli sul lato di donna, ma il nero è in grado di espandersi con a6, dxc4, b5, c5 (come si vede nel gioco). carlsen tentò di giocare la slava alle in olimpiadi di quest'anno, ma prima di allora, non aveva giocato l'apertura dal 2014. a questo punto è facile pensare che il team del russo avesse preparato questa apertura per prendere in contropiede magnus. cosa però che non si è realizzata. questa mossa permette alcune varianti della slava, limitando altre. (4. nf3 è anche popolare, ma questo cambia la direzione del gioco portandolo in linee e posizioni complicate questa variante è stata giocata più di 5000 volte: 4 ... dxc4 5. a4 bf5 6. e3 e6 7. bxc4 bb4 . in questo caso il bianco ha fatto una concessione legittima sul lato di donna consegnando la casa b4, ma bianco mira a muovere alla fine e3-e4 e colpire nel centro. c'è una certa tensione in questa linea con una forte concentrazione di pezzi minori che non è presente nel proseguimento del gioco. forse karjakin rammarica della direzione che ha preso il gioco.)  . . altra variante: 4... e6 [questa é la più usata]  . . . . .. . . questa mossa porta ad una struttura di gambetto di donna accettato.  . . . un tentativo insolito giocato fino ad ora solo una volta. altra alternativa: 10... qxd1 11. rxd1 bxc5 12. nd2 be7 13. nb3 nc6 14. f3 o-o 15. e4 rfc8 16. be3 ne5 17. na5 bc6 18. f4 nc4 19. bxc4 bxc4 20. nxc4 rab8 21. e5 ne4 22. nxe4 bxe4 23. b3 rd8 24. ba7 rbc8 25. bb6 rxd1+ 26. rxd1 bd5 27. ne3 bc6 28. rc1 f6 29. bd4 kf7 30. kf2 h5 31. g3 ke8 32. nc4 bb7 33. ke3 rc7 34. rc3 rc8 35. exf6 gxf6 36. nd2 rxc3+ 37. bxc3 bd5 38. kd4 kd7 39. nc4 kc6 40. kd3 [wang,y (2730)-wang,h  (2734) danzhou 2016 1-0 (64)]  dopo questa mossa il nero sta un po' meglio. carlsen può conquistare una tranquilla patta. probabilmente però non molto di più. altra possibile variante: 11. qc2 nb4 12. qb1 (12. qb3 bxc5 13. rd1 qe7 14. a4) 12... bxc5 13. rd1 qc7 14. a3 nbd5 15. nxd5 nxd5 16. bd2 be7 17. qd3 rd8 18. rac1 qb8 19. qb1 o-o 20. ba5 rc8 21. h3 rxc1 22. rxc1 rc8 [1/2-1/2 (21) bischoff,k (2533) -schlosser,p (2554) austria 2006]  . . . . . . . . altra possibilità : 15... f5 [per creare un po' di pressione a carlsen non restava che giocare questa mossa]  la patta è nell'aria.  un errore inspiegabile che costringe carlsen a giocare con senza possibilità di errore per un paio di mosse per salvare il gioco. fortunatamente per lui la cosa si è rivelata abbastanza facile. avrebbe avuto più facilmente la patta con qualsiasi altra mossa. mossa migliore: 16... bd5 [gli avrebbe fatto la vita più facile] 17. nf6+ bxf6 18. bxb4 bxa1 19. bxf8 kxf8 20. bxd5 qxd5 21. qxd5 exd5 22. rxa1 rc8 23. h3 ke7 24. b4 rc4  . . . . . questa mossa garantisce una patta tranquilla.  a qiesto punto non servono altri commenti. carlsen gioca per la patta, che oramai è sicura, e karjykin non può far latro che accettarla. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . il risultato è stato una piccola sorpresa. ma era difficile intravvedere un piano di gioco più utile al bianco. volendo, però, quest'ultimo avrebbe potuto continuare a mantenere carlsen sotto pressione. ma con certi campioni è difficile forzare un errore che permetta una vittoria. quest'ultima, a questo livello, è possibile conquistarla solo con una pianificazione perfetta del gioco e senza eccessive sbavature.

my favourite. bad, because qb6 now forces me out of my lines.  but to play this move or not is a matter of taste. so let's continue the bluff. theory prefers e3, here, but i want to keep e4 as a threat.  finally guarding against qb6.  a quiet line, but solid for me to break.  let's go! preparing e4, nº 1.  preparing e4, nº 2.  preparing e5. i have to fight that, but my advance comes first.  black is still a move behind to play e5.  ok, so what? i'm not bad, but black is still very solid.  ...as this knight manouver proves.  trying to provoke f6, making my bc4 a more valuable move. in case of bishop's exchange, we'll have a fuzzy game.  not releasing the tension. i'm waiting to play g5 until the black's lsb is on the board.  hmmm... does black have an attack on the queenside? well, just in case... strange move, but it was not clear who was in charge here.  let's make my pawn worth! maybe not the right choice, but i thought that a tempo in doubling rooks was interesting to unbalance the position... one side or another. moreover, i was looking hard at c4... maybe not the best option. i wanted to assure control over the g5 square, to avoid the nasty bh6+. but i didn't want to exchange my bishop with no reason.  i expected e5, here.  a little "breath" that gave me a tempo to, hopefully, get something back. the idea was c5, but the knight takes the rook with check, which i overlooked badly.  i expected qxc5+, winning anothe pawn.  at least i deflected the pawns and my two angels are more free to fly. i planned to set the bishop in c3. e3 would have worked, but it blocks the semicolumn "e" i can use to pressure on with my rook.  reinforcing e5... i cannot take the bishop out of the diagonal, not now... with almost no plan. the truth is i am lost! if e5, i cannot answer d5 because of e4, forking with a check threat.  i'll say a blunder. e5 would have crushed me.  ok, so give your damn check in h6, but now the position is looser... that's all, folks! well... ok, now is the moment to risk something.  now it could have been a good idea d5, but... ...seemed better to me. anyway, white is still lost, but you know, in blitz... :-))) nice! of course, rxn leaves me just undefended, since re8+ is impossible.  ?!!! wow, this suddenly looks interesting!  i think it is the right one, since it threats a lot of squares and guards f3. nxg6 threats rxc6, nxe7+, recovering the material. rd8+, rxr, bxr, and black can stop the pawn with rf8. he will lose it, anyway.  this is another way. i cannot tell if better or not.  my turn.  better was rf-f8, nxg6.  no hope for black, now. the rest of the game was not actually played.   
-------------------------------------

a tactical unexpected victory. i play the budapest, but now it is impossible, so... what? i found this apparently dull move in the database. the plan is to play till g4. it is probably not so good, but i like to experiment.  white is not bad, but it is a strange play for him, since the knight in d3 is unusual.  this is the normal strategy of the average player: pawns up! it is not necessarily bad: i feel "squeezed", in fact.  i must just stay calm.  this is a mistake. he must open the white diagonal, not to block it.  i hate this positions specially from the black point of view. he has a better position, undoubtely, more space, more ways of action. but he has the problem to seek the correct way to brake into mine.  looking for some space for my pieces. i thought about the queenside, but i had not clear how we could fight there. i cannot easily penetrate, nor him. if he plays nb5, a6 just gets it back. he can try with b4, but if he does, i can stand it. despite of the blocked white diagonal, white seems to be very easy, and black very unconfortable.  the hidden reason for this move is to activate the black squares's bishop.  thank you. maybe he feared h4 from me...  the c4 pawn gives me a tempo.  controlling g4 and a4. i had nothing concrete in mind, till now.  well, if he doesn't go for the queenside, i will. of course, i should have developed but... castling under the open g column? no, thank you.  red alert! the opponent made this move! doesn't he see the danger on the a column? probably yes, but he underestimated it.  no no, it leaves c4 undefended.  now he thinks everything is ok, since the c4 pawn is defended. but i already looked ahead.  i thought a lot if to take with the rook, instead, threatening e4... i don't remember the whole sequence, but finally i decided to make the normal one, just to threat nxd2 and bh6. to defend or not to defend? i think this is a really interesting position. he can take my knight and my rook, but i will have two tempos... what can i do in 2 tempos? a lot.  and, after taking the rook, his bishop would be trapped and almost useless.  i didn't like defending moves like bg7 or nh7, since the key for me is to use the bishop in h6, just into the heart of white's position, and i won't accomplish that with them.   variants are a lot, and all interesting.   23.	nxa3	rxc3+ 24.	kb2	nxe4 25.	bxe4	bxe4 26.	qxe4	rxg3...   the correct one, i thought. of course, i cannot just retire the knight, my other one must be lost for something. i spent a lot of time looking through variants with both kxn, qxn, or the obvious bxnf6. i couldn't see a clear victory, there are a lot of tricks on both sides.  now, the key is in activating the queen, that is not easy. qb5 only allows rb1. i am pretty proud of the next move, that leaves both my n and my r to his bishop just in order to win tempos. 24.	..., 	a4-a3 25.	bxf6	bh6 26.	rb1	qa4+ 27.	rb3	b5 28.	bxh8	b4 29.	bxh5	rxc3+ 30.	rxc3	b4xrc3 31.	kxc3	qd4+ 32.	kc2	be4+ 33.	rd3	qb2+ 34.	kd1	qc1# opens the squares for the black queen, due to the pin of the white knight. after bxn, qa4 and... wait a minute! there is no mate there! he could escape on the kingside, and i am not sure at all my attack won't vanish, letting me with just two pieces under! i went for it just after considering the 2º tempo the bishop's take will leave me. time to block the white king with bh6! ok, am i sure about what am i doing? no risk, no gain.  7 points under. bud, you better be sure about it, or you will lose with a much inferior opponent.  now, he blunders for a mate in two. but interesting is to observe 28.	b1-a1 	c8-c3 29.	h1-b1	        c3-c1 30.	b1-c1	        h6-c1 31.	d3-b3  	c1-b2+ 32.	a1-b1 	b4-c5 33.	e2-e1 	c5-d5 pretty crazy... and i am still a rook under, but with a strong attack. now, to be absolutely sure i will win, not at all! no risk, no win.   or, look at this one:  28.	b1-a1	        c8-c3 29.	h8-f6 	b4-b2+ 30.	e2-b2	        a3-b2+ 31.	a1-b2	        c3-d3  pure chess!  but  28.	b1-a1	        c8-c3 29.	h1-b1	        c3-c1 30.	b1-c1	        h6-c1 31.	d3-b3	        c1-b2+ 32.	a1-b1	        b4-c5 33.	e2-b5+	c5-b5 34.	b3-b5	  and i am the trapped one! but...  34.	b3-b5 	f7-f5 35.	b5-b7	        f5-e4 36.	f3-d1 	e4-e3+ 37.	d1-c2	        g6-c2+ 38.	b1-c2 	e3-e2 39.	c2-d2	        b2-c3+  so he has to lose his rook for my bishop in order to save himself, so... enough? :-) now he's lost. it's a pity. it could have been a most interesting game.   
-------------------------------------
! this is my home preparation against alekhine’s defense. i call it the “three pawns” variation: white pushes the f-pawn but not the c-pawn. it sets a really fascinating trap, which i used once to defeat im jake kleiman. (i gave a chesslecture on that game a few years ago.) what makes this trap so effective against a high-rated player is that it’s several moves deep. the higher-rated player will think that he is being really clever, playing a four-move combination to win a pawn, little realizing that this is exactly what the lower-rated player wants him to do. also very interesting is 8. qe4, “falling into black’s trap.” after 8. … qxd4! white of course does not play 9. qxd4?? nc2+ but instead plays 9. qxb7! however, the insanity that follows is difficult to calculate. i prefer the text move because it has a clear strategic plan behind it: sacrificing a pawn for rapid development and pressure on black’s kingside. black is morally obliged to take the pawn; otherwise he would have to admit that the knight sortie to b4 was just a waste of time. this is where kleiman played 9. … qg4?! against me and went down to a rapid defeat. the text move seems like the most principled answer, putting pressure on c2 and preventing me from castling. the trap initiated with 5. bd3 doesn’t lead to a forced win or even a forced advantage; it simply forces black to make a lot of difficult decisions, while white has an easy initiative. in practical chess, playing against a human, i would take white’s position any day of the week. against a computer, of course, it’s not quite so easy. one of the first decision points for white. rybka slightly prefers 12. nxd5, with two points: 12. … qxd5 will allow white to castle easily, while 12. … ed will allow 13. e6! with quick pressure against black’s king. nevertheless, 12. ne4 is also a very playable move, and i think that for a human player it’s a little bit more intuitive; as the attacker, white would prefer to avoid exchanges. ? rybka says 15. nd4 qd7 16. bb2 with full compensation for the pawn. the text move attempts to prevent black from castling queenside, but the trouble is that the bishop can be chased away. ? because shredder’s rating is set at 2220, not full strength (2600), it will make an occasional inaccuracy. this move is a very human-like mistake. black has two key moves, … qd3 and … g5, but shredder makes them in the wrong order. after 18. … g5! black would stand better, because sacrificing on g5 would be unsound for white. ! now the sacrifice is completely sound: 20. … hg? 21. qxf7+ leads to mate very quickly. but shredder came up with a remarkable resource: ! this is computer chess at its best (or worst): it comes up with moves that most humans would not even look at. at this point, it was time to call in the canine reinforcements! actually, what i did was take a time-out. i’ve written about this before: when i play the computer, i allow myself one chance per game to stop the clock and analyze the position on a board. i call it “matrix chess,” because i’m like neo in the matrix movies, who can stop time to defeat his computer adversaries. but i can only do it once a game; that makes it a challenge to find the right high-leverage moment. so i stopped my clock and set up a chessboard. when daisy saw me hunched over the chessboard, she seized her opportunity to jump up on her favorite spot: my back! so what would you play in the position above: a) exf6 (yes, it’s legal!), b) nf3, or c) nh3? i was very pleased that daisy and i not only found a good move, but we predicted the actual game variation up to move 29. truly a successful collaboration! first, (a) is bad. after 21. ef? now black can take the knight without getting checkmated. after 21. … hg! 22. f7+ kd7! (not 22. … kd8 or … ke7, when 23. qf6+ wins) i was exceedingly surprised to find out that white has no good way to take advantage of black’s seemingly exposed king. for instance, if 23. bxg5 bd6 24. nf3 qf5 and what next? black’s pieces are all active and there are no obvious breakthroughs for white — and black’s b and r are eyeing the h2 pawn with hostile intent. (b) is the move i played, and you’ll see my analysis shortly. (c) is actually the move that rybka thinks is best! i very nearly played it. for instance, daisy and i liked white’s position in lines such as 21. nh3 nxb3 22. nf4 qxd2? 23. qf3! h5 24. qxb3 bc5+ 25. kh1. this is the position that you see in the photograph! black can finally castle if he wants, but he’s not likely to live very long. unfortunately, black had a resource that daisy and i couldn’t find any good answer to: 21. nh3 nxb3 22. nf4 bc5! amazingly, black comes out ahead in all variations, for instance 23. nxd3 bxf2+ 24. rxf2 nxa1. white can trap the knight in the corner with 25. ne1, but it takes too long to bring the rook to a square where it can attack the knight, and meanwhile black can rescue it with … a5, … a4, … nb3. this was such a bummer that daisy and i gave up on 21. nh3 altogether. but in fact, rybka says that white gets a comfortable advantage after 21. nh3! nxb3 22. nxb3 qxb3 23. nf4 qxc4. i think that we underestimated this because we saw white sacrificing two pawns for nebulous counterplay. but actually, rybka says it’s overwhelming after 24. rc1 qb3 25. qe2!, threatening qh5+. there are too many leaks in black’s position, he can’t cover them all. there’s a great lesson here, which is that if you’ve sacrificed a pawn for some counterplay, you can often get overwhelming counterplay by sacrificing a second pawn. daisy and i were not quite ambitious enough. however, in variation (b) we found a really nice,  ? too greedy. according to rybka, black should hold white to a slight advantage with 21. … rg8. ! now black cannot stop the queen from invading the heart of the black position. a key point that daisy and i had to foresee is that 25. … kc6? would allow white to win a queen with 26. nd4+. loose pieces drop off! black’s moves are all forced. ! once daisy and i found this move, we were sold on 21. ngf3. of course black cannot accept the queen sacrifice because 28. … rxe6? 29. rd8 is mate. at this point daisy and i stopped our analysis because we thought white’s advantage was clear. true, but winning this position is by no means routine or easy! in fact, the thing i’m proudest of in this game is that i continued to find strong moves without help from my faithful canine companion (and without time-outs). i was quite surprised here that black didn’t continue to press forward with the knight fork, 30. … ne3, and instead played the purely defensive retreat 30. … nb6. usually shredder prefers sharp, aggressive play even when it shouldn’t. but here i think that it realized white’s attack is just too strong after 30. … ne3 31. qf7 rc8 32. bd8! for example, if 32. … nxf1 33. rxc7! is the coup de grace. nice stuff! i’m not sure if i would have found this last move.  having forced shredder into a rare passive move, i thought it was time to press my advantage. ! again a sac that shredder can’t take, because after 31. … nxd7 32. ed the pawn will queen. probably 31. rh7 would have been okay too, but i thought it was important to put maximum pressure on black in order to keep shredder’s defenses disorganized. ! should i go to d1 or e1? it was a choice that i made on intuitive grounds. after 32. re1 i was uneasy about the pin on the e-pawn. it turned out that i was right: 32. re1? nxd7! 33. ed rxe1+ 34. nxe1 qxh4! (a move i didn’t see!) miraculously stops the pawn from queening and threatens mate. i’m glad that i trusted my gut and put the rook on d1 instead. now on rd8+ black’s king can escape to a7, and after that white’s advantage may start to evaporate. how can we keep that from happening? (space in case you want to think about it.) ! this is what you’re looking for on a chessboard, a sense of flow. one move naturally leading to another: rd7, e6, rxc7. the main point is that 33. … kxc7 34. bg3+ gives black a disastrous choice between 34. … kc6 ne5+ losing the queen and 34. … kc8 35. e7+ losing the king. even so, the computer isn’t done yet. it’s tough to outplay a tactical monster in a tactical position, and shredder makes me work for the point. even though this means giving up the attack, i thought that the choice was justified because i would have a winning endgame. i can’t let the position stay tactical forever — if i do, eventually the machine will find something that i’ll miss. there were only two flaws with my thinking. one is that the endgame was not as routine as i hoped. the second is that the position does stay tactical forever! ! this was the move that sold me on 34. rb1. amazingly, the only black piece that can defend the bishop is the king, and i felt certain that with enough checks i could pry the king away. again, my gut was correct, although the machine as usual made it harder than i thought it would be. finally! every king move allows a fork that wins the bishop. however, shredder does manage to snag two pawns as compensation. yes, white is completely winning — rybka gives me a +5-pawn advantage. however, over the board i didn’t know this, and the win was still looking anything but routine. with all my pawns gone except the forgotten soldiers at g2 and h2, i’m not going to win any pawn races. basically i have to play for either a checkmate or a major win of material. fortunately, the queen, bishop and knight are an extremely effective attacking force and black’s king is far from the rest of his army. for those reasons the position more or less played itself from here. black resigns.  the cutest finish is 48. … kd2 (or d1) 49. qd3+ kxe1 50. bg3 mate. if black plays 49. … kc1 instead, either 50. bc3 (my move) or 50. bd6 (rybka’s move) force black to shed material to avoid checkmate. what a fun game this was! we had an innovative opening; an exciting middlegame with a pawn sac, a knight sac, an exchange sac, a rook sac, and a queen sac (although black had to decline most of the sacrifices); and a complex endgame culminating in a king hunt and a checkmate. i hope you enjoyed it as much as daisy did! 
-------------------------------------
donald byrne (1930–1976) was one of the leading american chess masters at the time of this game. he won the 1953 u.s. open championship, and later represented the united states in the 1962, 1964, and 1968 chess olympiads. he became an international master in 1962, and probably would have risen further if not for ill health. robert "bobby" fischer (1943–2008) was at this time a promising young master. following this game, he had a meteoric rise, winning the 1957 u.s. open on tiebreaks, winning the 1957–58 u.s. (closed) championship (and all seven later championships in which he played), qualifying for the candidates tournament and becoming in 1958 the world's youngest grandmaster at the age of 15. he won the world championship in 1972, and is considered by many to be the greatest chess player of all time... in this game, fischer demonstrates noteworthy innovation and improvisation. byrne, after a standard opening, makes a seemingly minor mistake on move 11, losing a tempo by moving the same piece twice. fischer pounces with brilliant sacrificial play, culminating in a queen sacrifice on move 17. byrne captures the queen, but fischer gets far too much material for it – a rook, two bishops, and a pawn. at the end, fischer's pieces coordinate to force checkmate, while byrne's queen sits, useless, on the other side of the board...  after a rather peculiar opening sequence, we reached some breed of the grünfeld defense; white controls much of the center, but black has already castled... after e4, d6 (black needs to prepare c5), be2, white has solid play... daring but not too solid; better d6, e4, nbd7, be2, c5, d5, ng4... there is no doubt, that e3, dxc4 (c6, qb3), bxc4, nbd7, ne5 would have been much safer... no use, is the so-called prins variation na6; e3, c5, dxc5, qa5, be5!... also here, e3 would have been much sounder play; after qb6, be2, be6, qd3, all is well... also qb3, nbd7 e3, poses no problems... b5, qb3, qa5, bd3, leads nowhere soon; qb6 might disrupt whites' play, after be2, qxb2, rb1, qa3, 0-0, qa5... also here be2 was to be much preferred; after nb6, qb3... not safe at all; best is qb3, be6, qc2, bg4, be2... just playing the best moves; after this be2, nfd7, qg5, bxf3, bxf3, e5, and we trade queens... but this is taking too much out of whites' defenses; absolutely necessary was be2... this move - which is not bad at all, is dubbed "one of the most powerful moves of all time."  fischer offers an ingenious knight sacrifice. if byrne played nxa4, fischer would reply nxe4, leaving byrne with some terrible choices...  or qb4, nxc3, bxc3, nxe4, bxe7, a5! (qb6 is better for white), qa3, qd7, bxf8, bxf8... at this point, bxf8, bxf8, qb3, nxc3, qxb6, axb6, ra1/rd2, was still worth considering... but now, fischer is unleashed and pushes another sacrifice... no good either is qxc3, rfe8, 0-0, rxe7, rde1, rae8, ne5, be6... this must certainly be the move, that made this game famous; a queen sacrifice upon two earlier sacrifices... the best way out of this is qxc3, qxc5, dxc5, bxc3, bxe6, rxe6; byrne decides to take the queen, much to his dismay... blacks' pieces are working nicely together in this stunning windmill variation... white is left without a chance... no use either is qxa4, nxa4, h3, bxa2, kh2... slightly better is qxb7, bd5, re1... only speeding up the process, but this is lost anyway; tougher is kh3, nf2+, kg3... breaking the pin over bf8... walking straight into mate, out of respect for bobbys' play; nxg6 would have been tougher, but also losing... kh2, nd2, takes a while longer... and thus, a new windmill emerges... or ba3 mate... after this game, byrne took up bobby as a prodigy and mentored him for a long while; they even became close friends... the rest is history... 
-------------------------------------
 this has been my last game with the master mater or which will be for a while - he sure finished the game in his style!  anyhow, this game starts off with a reti (1. nf3) and freddy gives me a bizarre looking gambit - (2.g5). 2. ...... g5 - of which gameknot calls it a mistake: +1.17 » … g5 1. nxg5 h6 2. nf3 nf6 3. nc3 rg8 4. rg1 nc6 5. d3 d6 6. e4 be6 7. be3 nb4
-------------------------------------
 best: +0.00 » … nf6 1. c4 (the more regular line of the reti).  freddy was trying to take me out of the db here. 5. nfd2 - this knight has been kicked around for the last two or three moves and now blocks in fou lenoir. 7. ..... qxd5 - the wicked witch of the west is well centralised here and not very easy to drive away. 9. nc3 - but at least here i manage to develop with an attack on that evil besom! 11. nxf3 - i decided to try and get rid of that cramping pawn, improve the position of my king knight and free up a square for fou lenoir.  nice to accomplish 3 things in one move! 14. bd2 - all my pieces are now developed and i have a choice as to where to put henry.  kingside or queenside, which is the safest?  oh where is my crystal ball when i need it? 15. 0-0-0 - queenside i choose you!  i did consider the kingside but then freddy has a ready-made open g column to attack henry, he already has the wicked witch on the h column and all he has to do is to develop his dsb and then the heavies can pile up quite quickly on the g column.  i remember a game where i took what looked like a free pawn on the file in front of henry where he could bring a rook to quickly - freddy did use this as a basis for a mating attack so once bitten, twice shy! 16. qxd3 - oh, oh, with fou leblanc off the board freddy now has carte blanche to put his lsb on the b1-h7 diagonal. 18. ne5 - this move looked good at the time, piling up on the f7 pawn and threatening to exchange on d2 to get rid of said light square bishop. 19. bxc3 - but freddy had a very clever intermezzo - a forced exchange on c3. 21. rd2?! - i was doing ok until here when gameknot marked up this move as an inaccuracy: -1.03 » 21. rd2 bxe5 22. dxe5 rxd2 23. kxd2 bd5 24. rg1 qxh2 25. kc1 rg6 26. rh1 qxg2 27. qxg2 bxg2 28. rd1

-------------------------------------
 hmm, i like the look of the best line - i would have then followed it up with 29. qd5 forcing an exchange of queens and activating my rook.  sadly i missed that line. 23. kxd2 - this rook trade does not ease the pressure on my position, freddy still has enough pieces to combine a mating attack. 26. qc1 - oh dear, that move was to prevent qc2+ but gameknot calls it a blunder: -7.03 » 26. qc1 rd8+ 27. bd4 rxd4+ 28. exd4 qxd4+ 29. ke2 bg4+ 30. ke1 qxg1+ 31. kd2 qxh2+ 32. kd3 qxg3+ 33. qe3 bf5+ 34. kd2 qg2+ 35. qe2 qd5+ 36. ke1

 best: -0.94 » 26. bd4 qc2+ 27. ke1 c5 28. bc3 bg4 29. rg2 qd1+ 30. kf2 qxf1+ 31. kxf1 bh3 32. b3 rd8 33. g4 bxg2+ 34. kxg2 kc7
-------------------------------------
 at the end of the "best" analysis however i will still be the exchange down. 28. bd4?? - a move which was suggested by gameknot a few moves back is now a horrible blunder: -18.61 » 28. bd4 rxd4 29. h3 rd1+ 30. qxd1 qxe3+ 31. kf1 bxd1 32. rg2 bb3 33. rc2 bxc2 34. g4 qxh3+ 35. kf2 qxg4 36. e6 fxe6 37. ke3 qe4+ 38. kf2

-------------------------------------
 even in the "best" line i will still be q for b down and that is against master freddy, enough to justify resignation in my book! 29. qc3?? - this move allows #2 but gameknot's best move suggests i am busted anyhow.  this is far more painless! blunder: -mate(2) » 29. qc3 rd1+ 30. kf2 qf3#

in paris, morphy suffered from a bout of intestinal influenza. in accordance with the medical wisdom of the time, he was treated with leeches, resulting in his losing a significant amount of blood. although too weak to stand up unaided, morphy insisted on going ahead with a match against the visiting german master adolf anderssen, considered by many to be europe's leading player. despite his illness morphy triumphed easily, winning seven while losing two, with two draws. when asked about his defeat, anderssen claimed to be out of practice, but also admitted that morphy was in any event the stronger player and that he was fairly beaten. anderssen also attested that in his opinion, morphy was the strongest player ever to play the game, even stronger than the famous french champion louis charles mahe de la bourdonnais... karl ernst adolf anderssen was a german chess master. he is considered to have been the world's leading chess player for much of the 1850s and 1860s. although quite soundly defeated by paul morphy who toured europe in 1858, morphy retired from chess soon afterwards and anderssen was again considered the leading player...  not how we would handle this today; we do not want to encourage nc3, and end up in a closed sicilian, with the better play for white... better d5, or e5, or maybe nf6 or a6... the taimanov variation - not yet invented in those days - as always a burdon for black; especially after bf4... after a6, nd6+, bxd6, qxd6, qe7, qg3... better nf6, n1c3, d6; this pawn will become a weakness... like clockwork; this is practically forcing e5 to preserve d6... there is no doubt, that bg5, nf6, bc4 (threatening bxf7, followed by qd5 at some point), qa5+, nd2 is much stronger, but morphy is weaving an intricate trap, involving nb1-c3-nd5 to break open c7; so he needs nb1 for another exhibition... threatening f4, to no avail... best here is nf6, or be6 to prevent bc4... after nf6, n1c3, a6... this is suddenly very strong now... after a6, nd5!, axb5, bb6, qh4, nc7+, and loss of ra1... only this knight... morphy passes by on nxa8, exf2+, kxf2, qh4+, g3, qxe4, bg2, with a clear win ahead; after qh5+, g6, qf3+... black seems out of trouble, for now... or maybe not... the only one... after qxd5, nfxd5, nxf3+, gxf3, exf2+, kxf2, rb8, white is better... but far from winning... a tragic failure; after ke7, qh5 (the only one to keep an attack going), gxf6 (nxc2+, kd1!), qf7+, kd6, nxa8, nxc2+, ke2 (kd1 is losing now), nxa1, rc1, white has a lot more to prove... qe7, rxc8, qxf7, bxf7, bg7!, and white is still far from winning; now all is over... the next best move again; out of boredom? we will never know... directly winning however is of course f4!, threatening mate on qg5; after exf4, e5+, ke7, qf7 mate; after bb4+, c3, ke7, nxa8, clears all illusions... after ke7, qxe5+, ne6, nxe6, qd6, qg5+, ke8, nxg7+, bxg7, qxg7, black can safely give up... black resigns; after qxc7, raf1+, ke7, rf7+, he loses the queen... after his defeat by steinitz in 1866, anderssen became the most successful tournament player in europe, winning over half the events he entered—including the baden-baden 1870 chess tournament, one of the strongest tournaments of the era. he achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.  anderssen is famous even today for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the "immortal game" (1851) and the "evergreen game" (1852). he was a very important figure in the development of chess problems, driving forward the transition from the "old school" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.  he was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an "elder statesman" of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration...

ok, this is another draw, where i would ask stronger players to say whether they think one side or another had an advantage in the final position. weaker players may enjoy and interesting tussle. it started out as another noimzo-indian defence, so i would refer you to another anotated game adamraoof (2006) vs. charleshiggie (1932) for the first 3 moves on both sides. adam played a3 here, e3 is more common, and scores better according to the on-line databases. 0-0 and c5 are more commonly played than b6, but it is equally sound. white wants to avoid doubles pawns. black re-news the threat to double to c pawns. my scottish oponent takes the opportunity to get the 2 bishops. white had more central control and better development for the two bishops. chances are even. so far, as in aleksandrov, aleksej (2660) vs. ehlvest, jaan (2610) ½-½ in 16 moves (13. b4 qe7 14. rac1 bh6 15. bf1 g6 16. qc2 c6 draw agreed). i now come up with an alternative move.
-------------------------------------
here playing black on a challenge asked by juanefe. against d4, i play usually nf6 giving me the oportunity to play the king indian defense, the queen indian, the nimzo or the benoni. i'm not a big fan of the queen gambit, i find these games quite boring most of the time. the dutch, mostly the leningrad variation, look pretty interesting but i'm not experienced enought with this opening to think about playing it in a ranked game. maybe in a close future. well, to tell the truth, this move surprised me very much. i didn't seen this move quite often and seriously didn't know what to play against it. black still have a lot of choice and could transpose it to something lookliking at the qid, the kid or even the benoni. i think c4 is a little superior finally because it take the center right in the beginning, giving a lot of space to your pieces. i was thinking about to transpose into the benoni. with the knight on f3, white couldn't play the dangerous taimanov variation. this opening have his proper name, the spielmann-indian defense. the name come from of rudolf spielmann, one of the best attacker in the first part of the last century. ?! black have good results generally with the spielmann-indian. i think the best way to fight it as white is to advance the pawn to d5, going into the main lines of the benoni. by doing so, white continue to keep his center pawn and take more space. the benoni is not considered as one of the best defense for black, but i really like this opening because some of my favorite players (tal, velimirovic) could do miracles with this. anyway, it's rare that i enter into the main line of the benoni cause it's rare beginners know them (and i'm not going to help them to! :d). i don't like that much that c3 move because the knight will not be able to use it if black don't take the d4 pawn. well, here black could have done b6 and going for a double flanchetto, giving a fine position later. however, this move sounded more natural to me. i think it's a lost of tempo at this point of the game, but it's still playable. white have now the option to do b4 to threat the c5 pawn.  i think bg5 would have been better here. the fianchetto on the queen side is often used in the nimzo and the queen indian. with this kind of position, there's a lot of chance than white castle on the king side, so the bishop positionned on b7 can create some nice attacks. ?! at this point in the game, i was thinking that this match would be at first a fight of space. i thought that it would be a hard fight in closed position a la nimzowisht and i didn't wanted to be squizzed like a rat facing a snake. that's why i've been surprised by this move. white can now free his light squared bishop but it's gonna be harder for him to develop his queen side as we will see further in the game. ?! well i'm not sure if it was that much a good move. i think it was a kind of high risk high reward move. losing tempo but taking space and countering white's development on the queen side. it can pay as it can be a problem later because there's possibility that white find a way to take benefit of the weakness on b6 (only the queen can protect it right now) we're now both ready to castle on the king side. ?! white underestimated me here. with 5 pieces protecting the d7 pawn, there's no way white can dream of taking it, the only purpose of this move is to do qf3 to threat my rook. on a bullet game or against a weak player it can be a strong move and give a won game early in the game but in this case it will only result as a lost of tempo. o-o would have been better here. ! even if computer analysis doesn't like this move, i think it's a good move, useful later as much in offense than in defense. ! to me it was a great move, giving me the option to continue with f5 and even attacking on the queen side with nc7. the computer analysis doesn't have the same opinion.  computer analysis: inaccuracy: +0.37 » … ne8 10. o-o d6 11. ng4 nc7 12. bd3 f5 13. nf2 nd7 14. re1 b5 15. c4 bc6 16. cxb5 nxb5 best: +0.98 » … d6 10. nec4 nc6 11. dxc5 bxc5 12. o-o qc7 13. e4 d5 14. ne3 qf4 15. qe2 ne5 16. g3 qg5 ?

well i think it really didn't worth it for white to lose a bishop and a knight for a rook and a pawn. it was too early in the game to make this kind of sac; white didn't have enought advantage to do this and it didn't provoked anything. white still lack of development, not coordinated for a great attack and his pawn structure is not that fine. thinking about to exchange as much pieces as possible to finish this off. exchanging the pawn to not have the burden to protect it later, giving the possibility to dismantle the 3 linked pawns. my plan here was: 16.cxd4 f5! 17.o-o fxe4 18.qd2 nxe5 19.bxe5 exf3 20.gxf3. ? white want to keep his 3 linked pawns but keep getting lower in materials. black is better prepared than white right now to face this plan. ! i didn't liked the idea at this time that white exchange both his knight and bishop on my knights, moving my queen to c7. if my queen move, the white queen can get the d4 pawn. nc5 will give me some counterplay later. computer analysis: inaccuracy: +3.74 » 18. rae1 fxe4 19. nxc6 exd3 20. nxd8 rxd8 21. rd1 bf6 22. rxd3 d5 23. cxd5 e5 24. bg3 nc5 25. rd2 bxd5 26. rc1 best: +2.76 » 18. nxc6 bxc6 19. rae1 fxe4 20. fxe4 qb6 21. re2 qc5 22. ref2 a4 23. bg3 rxf2 24. rxf2 bf6 25. bf4 qh5 forcing the queen to stay back, threatening e4 and give the oportunity to advance my pawn to d4.  ?! i expected qd2 who looked more natural, protecting the bishop.  computer analysis: mistake: +4.26 » 19. qd1 fxe4 20. nxc6 bxc6 21. fxe4 qb6 22. qd2 nxe4 23. qd3 qxb2 24. rxe4 bxe4 25. qxe4 bxa3 26. bc7 rxf1+ 27. kxf1 qc1+ 28. kf2 best: +3.07 » 19. qd2 fxe4 20. fxe4 nxe5 21. bxe5 rxf1+ 22. rxf1 nxe4 23. qd3 qb6 24. rf4 qxb2 25. rxe4 bh4 26. g3 bxe4 27. qxe4 ??

white was trying to swindle the game. i can't take the rook because i would lose my queen or be mated. the game is lost for white now, there was now no way to avoid losing. mate is coming. well this was a very fun game with a lot of surprises! 
-------------------------------------
i start off with e4, as it often leads to wild tactical play. my opponent responds with a sicilian, common among high level players. i decided to go for the grand prix, as i would easily lose a steady positional game. in fact i hope to play the infamous bryntse gambit, which is 1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5 3. nf3 dxe4 4. ng5 nf6 5. bc4 bg4 6. bxf7+ kd7 7. qxg4+ nxg4 8. be6+ with an all-out attack. but my opponent does not comply. oh well... my opponent places his bishop to a strong square. he also prepares to castle. if he does, i would have a hard time to break through his defenses. i try to open some lines toward black's monarch, as a wild tactical play (which is my favourite type of play) is my best bet to at least draw the game. he accepts the gambit. the h5-e8 diagonal has somewhat opened for business. why not? i have to keep the king in check, or else he can escape. black gets somewhat greedy and attacks my lone knight. mybe better was kf8. now... of course! if i can bring his king towards my pieces, i may be able to mate him! that would be great... black is really greedy here. i don't know if there is a better move though. of course! he retreats to a square where i can't check him without simply losing a piece. what to do? ! i cut any escape the black king had and i threaten bg5+, which would be very dangerous. he brings in his knight and frees the e5 square for his. of course! this move serves two purpose: it protects the c2 pawn while allowing my rook on the e file. my king cannot be checked for now as well. ? black tries to develop his pieces while giving cover squares for his king. however... i won't allow the black king to escape! if the black king goes to f6, i simply plays bg5+. he must either take the perpetual or lose his queen (at least). however, if he takes my bishop... ??which he does...  !! deadly move. i cut off any escape square from the black king. i also threaten g3#, which is almost unavoidable. the only move! of course. ? re3+ is better, as it forces mate quicker. and i must not play 17.qg5+ because of 17...bg4+ 18.kc1 bh6, pinning my queen to my king. do not want. those bishops can be pesky here.  ? surprisingly, kf2 is better­ (i think). i now see the forced mate... of course! my queen switches from light square control to dark squares control. my b1 knight shall go to d2, where it controls three key light squares. 18...kf3 19.nd2+ kf2 20. qg3# not 19.rg4+, because of 19...bxg4+. only move. of course! the king must go to d3. forced check and mate! after many sacrifices to bring the black king near my pieces, i finally finish him off. since this was in a simul, i can't take full credits for that. however, it is still a victory against an im, with a totally unsound opening and a sack-fest of pieces. even though we both made mistakes, it was very fun to play. please feel free to leave any comments and/or feedback whether it is positive or negative. that way, i will be able to make better annotations. until then, adieu!

grand master chess game, pal benko vs shimon kagan winnipeg 1967  ·  caro-kann defense: classical variation http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1536419   the caro-kann defense.           this move by black marks the caro-kann classical version.                                                                                                       this 30th move is where i believe black erred. he put both queen side pawns on black squares, one under attack from a bishop, one from another pawn. if your opponent only has one bishop, it is frequently good to put your pawns on that color, to restrict the bishop. on the other hand, i always say there is an exception to every rule! his two queen side pawns are not stable enough. he ended up losing both pawns (one traded, one taken for free), which left his king open to attack. to defend his king he had to sack his queen for a rook, then white got a 2nd queen, and it was downhill from there. i say instead of 30. ... a5, black had 2 feasible game plans at his disposal:  1. he could have played 30. ... rd1 +, as he did play on the next move, after messing up his pawn structure! if 31. qxr then qxr. or if 31. ka2 then qd5+. blacks pawns would still be intact, and his king a lot safer. he could then choose to play 32. ... b5 to keep the queen out.  2. or he could have played 30. ... b5. with the pawns on white squares and white only having a dsb, black's pawns would come under less attack.   black would then have a slightly inferior pawn structure. white would have a queen side pawn majority (3-2), black a king side pawn majority (4-3). white would have a passed c-pawn, but it's well blockaded by a queen which would be hard to move, since the rook can't get in, the bishop is on dark squares, and the queen, if she gets in can be traded. black has a backward g-pawn, but it is well defended.  so the pawn inferiority would be hard to take advantage of in my opinion, and black should have a good game. black can't play 31. ... pxb due to rc4 wins the queen.                                                             and it's over!

hi all, this is recent game i played in jo's welcome nº3 mini-tournament. it is interesting mainly for the final position, i'm not able (since i have no chess engine) to tell if it was won or not, and i would like some advice. this was a mistake. the theory about icelandic gambit says nf6 first, hoping for white to move the c or d pawn. now, it is premature. because of this move, that shields white about all the tactics that arise after d4 or c4 are played. it's not a disaster, but now the gambit is not all that exciting anymore.  my opponent doesn't take advantage of the free tempo to develop a piece. bc4 is kind of pointless, since no serious threat can be put on f2 in a short time.  i can play this in order to get some control of the center, open the lines for my queen, get out the b8 knight without blocking my c pawn, and since little attack can be performed on the a4-e8 white diagonal by white because of d3.  kingside castling, and a battery against the kingside is served.  black is ahead in developement, but no concrete attack... still. it will come shortly after. not qc7 because of nb5. but a bishop sac on h3 is worth considering. i could have played bc7, or nxn (recommended by gk engine), but i wanted to "tempt" him to... ...in order to play this, opening a column for a kingside attack.  this rook is not misplaced here, but i plan to move it quickly to theg column.  white's play is passive, but i can understand the point: to provoke exchanges without disrupting the king's pawn chain. the plan will not work because i have f5.  or ne5, fighting for g4. but i don't want to exchange, only have more firepower against the white king.  kind of good, controlling the black diagonal. if it wouldn't be because of the control white has of f3, i would have gone bxh3 right now.  firepower into the fight. it's amazing how white, just because of a couple of weak moves in the opening, seems now completely frozen, with no countergame.  temporarily avoiding bxh3, but at the cost of an even more cramped game (the bishop cannot move or bxh3. i think kh1 was the indicated move, followed by rg1.  hunting the bishop, with f4 the next move.  i expected f4. the f5 pawn is blocking my own attack, but i can make something of it moving my battery to the white diagonal aiming to g2 in a couple o moves (nd4, bd5, qf6). i only have to find the right order.    threatening to exchange white's lsb.  white could have gone be5+, f6, bxn etc, but this would have allowed me to further advance the f pawn.  step two.  step 3. as predicted, weapons are aiming the right spot.  gk engine says this is a mistake. but it doesn't explains why. i'd like to think this is because of my next move, but i am not all that sure, either.  was this sac correct? i played it almost without thinking.  and here it comes: is this position winning for black?  gk engine says this is a blunder, preferring bxn+. it is a thematic line, and i thought white is lost, and so did white, because it resigned. but the gk engine says white is >+2! what do you think? of course the threat is ne1+, 22. kh2, rg2+, 23. kh1, rxf2+, 24. kh2, rxr+, 25. kh2, rh1+, 26. kg3, qf6 etc. but does it win? too lazy to see further... :-)

. . . . . . . . . . se 5. ... bc5 6. nxe5 nxe5 7. d4 e il bianco ottiene un vantaggio controlla e4. questa è la variante preferita da carlsen nella partita spagnola (ruy lopez) chiusa. . . . . con 8. ... bg4 9. be3 il gioco tornava in parità con 9. h3 be6 il bianco avrebbe incrementato il leggero vantaggio . . il bianco minaccia di guadagnare materiale. altra possibile continuazione 11. re1 nd8 12. d4 nc6 13. dxe5 nxe5 14. qe2 c5 15. rad1 c4 16. ba2 nxf3+ 17. qxf3 qe6 18. h3 h6 19. bf4 a5 20. qe2 rfc8 21. rd4 rc5  . . . . . se 14. qa1 ne6 . . . . . . . . . . . . . consolida f4 . . . se 23. b4  bb6 24. be3 . . . . non era male 25... ba5 26. d6 bxe1 27. nxf7 nf4 28. bh6+ kf6 29. bxf4 exf4 30. qxf4+ kg7 31. qh6+ kf6 32. qg5+  . carlsen inizia un attacco, ben programmato ma poco supportato  . . . . minaccia bf3 . con questa continuazione forse la partita avrebbe avuto un altro esito: 30. bh8 re7 31. qxc5 ng7 32. h4 ne6 33. bxe6 qxe6 34. d4 bd6 35. qb5 e4 36. qg5 qd5 37. bf6 re6 38. qxd5 bxd5 39. ng4 re8 40. ne5 rc8 . questa è la mossa che forse ha deciso la partita. carlsen, fino a questo momento in possesso di un leggero vantaggio, forse deciso a guadagnare, al minimo, una patta, inizia una fase di inesorabile caduta. molto meglio, come valutato da + esperti giocatori, era giocare: 31. bd5 bxd5 32. qxc5+ kg7 33. qxd5 kxh6 34. qxf7 ba5 35. qxe8 bxe1 36. qxe5 bd2 37. be7 qf5 38. qxf5 gxf5 39. b4 kg6 40. b5 kf7 41.ba3 ke6 42. b6 kd7 43. kf1 kc6 44. ke2 . . . c5 è un pedone avvelenato. fortunatamente il bianco non è caduto nella trappola. mai qxbf3 perché la torre è persa . . . . . . . il nero ha raggiunto, grazie alla passività del bianco, lo scopo che si era prefisso. un attacco sul lato del re con forze nettamente in maggioranza.  . . . pista libera . . . . non cambia l'andamento della partita. . sperando contro ogni speranza. il gioco è deciso . 44. nh6, gli conveniva ripararsi in questa posizione liberando l'alfiere dal suo gravoso impegno. l'attacco continua . . . il nero ha campo libero . . sperando in un miracolo con 49. ... g1=q non c'è più nulla da fare. a mio avviso, in questa partita carlsen ha mostrato una strana immobilità. forse per merito di svidler ma, penso, più a demerito di carlsen. la combinazione di attacco a metà partita ha impegnato posizionamene dei pezzi che avrebbero potuto essere molto più utili se maggiormente attivi. un eccesso di sicurezza o troppa enfasi giovanile? 
-------------------------------------
. . . . . . . . . in questa apertura siciliana (b67), fabiano opta per una variante complicata, la rauser, che l'anno scorso, non senza rischi, gli ha creato una certa popolarità . . . . . . . in questa posizione il nero ha diverse possibilità. la scelta di fabiano è dettata dai suoi propositi per la prossima mossa. una specialità di li chao che anand ha a lungo studiato e rielaborato (intervista con caruana a fine partita) . sarebbe stato meglio 10. ... cxe4 11. de1 cf6  in vista di 12. cf5. per una partita così importante, anche queste mosse sarebbero state da prendere in considerazione. . l'idea è quella di indebolire la posizione del re avversario e le case bianche. un'idea intelligente. al nero sarebbe stato più utile avere il pedone in h7 anziché in h6. . . . forse 13. cxc6 seguito da ad3 avrebbe permesso al bianco una più ampia possibilità di gioco. . dxc6! insolita risposta con questa struttura di gioco, ma a mio parere, più forte che catturare il cavallo con l'alfiere. fabiano tiene protetta la casa d7 per rinforzare la debolezza di e6. il ragionamento è abbastanza lungo, ma interessante. se fosse stato giocato  14. ... axc6 15. ad3 h5 16. rb1 b4 17. ce2 dc5 18. thf1 ah6 19. te1 a5 20. b3 avrebbe permesso al bianco di poter pianificare ad3-c4 e ce2-d4 mentre il nero avrebbe dovuto perdere tempo prezioso per coprire pe6.  . . . 16. ... ah6?! 17. df2 avrebbe aiutato il bianco a amalgamare maggiormente la formazione. . . fabiano  si accorge delle conseguenze della sua apertura che in questa occasione non ha dato i frutti che sperava. infatti giocando 18. e5!. il bianco avrebbe sacrificato un pedone per scardinare il muro davanti al re nero. . . . assicura all'alfiere una posizione forte nella diagonale a2-g8, non per attaccare ma per premunirsi contro la probabile a5-a4. 20. ... a4, 21. ac4 axb3, 22. axb3 non aiuta il nero. il re bianco è al sicuro grazie a ab3. . . . nell' hockey si potrebbe definire questa mossa un passaggio intelligente in un'altra zona. con 22. ... tg4, 23. cd4 a4, 24. tf3 il bianco avrebbe avuto tutto sotto controllo. forse cf4 avrebbe reso la partita più interessante. . . . . cercare di mantenere l'alfiere, avrebbe dopo: 25. ... ad4, 26. tfd3 ae5, 27. cxh5, creato solo problemi. . come riconosciuto da caruana dopo la partita, 26. ... ac6 avrebbe alleviato la tensione sui suoi pezzi. se il bianco avesse risposto con 27. dd3, il nero avrebbe replicato con tf7?! rendendo il sacrificio di pedone più utile e limitando l'iniziativa del bianco. . . ora il bianco sta elaborando e4-e5. . . . non c'è alcuna possibilità per il bianco di di rintuzzare questa offensiva. ma probabilmente fabrizio deve aver pensato che l'attacco è la miglior difesa :-) . si poteva giocare anche 31. dh7+ tf7, 32. dh8. . . . . . . con 34. ... d5, 35. dh7+ tf7, 36. dh8, il nero avrebbe avuto qualche difficoltà nel bilanciamenro della struttura della sua formazione. il bianco si è accentrato. . . probabilmente sarebbe stato meglio giocare; 36. ... ae4, 37. txb4 dc6, 38. rb2, portando la partita verso una patta. la ragione di questa mossa è chiara anche perchè è l'unica da giocare in questa combinazione finale. . minaccia matto in d7. la disarmonia nella formazione dei neri, nonostante il vantaggio materiale, è un grande svantaggio. si sarebbe potuto giocare anche td4, ma anche dopo 39. dxd4 dxd4, 40. txd4 tb8, per il nero sarebbe stato difficile non perdere. . a questo punto fabiano caruana ha chiesto la patta che, logicamente, è stata rifiutata. . . . . se 42. ... rf7, 43. dh7+ re6 44. dd7# matto. 
-------------------------------------
"white’s 8. bb5+!? was perhaps anand’s way of sidestepping his opponent’s prematch preparations, as after the game’s 8. … nc6 9. d5, the line 9. … a6?! 10. be2 bxc3+ 11. bd2 bxa1 12. qxa1 nd4 13. nxd4 cxd4 14. qxd4 0-0 15. 0-0 is one of the classic grunfeld variations where white’s two bishops are considered worth at least as much as the lost exchange." i guess all this should be well covered by theory. since i don't study, it seems a very interesting and tactic game to me... :-).   i don't guarantee the quality of the moves in the following lines, then! theorists are welcomed to pitiless destroy my attempts to explore myself some well-known lines, probably choosing the wrong way. i'm only enjoying myself.   now, black can try to cash in with 9... bxc3+, 10. bd2 (just guessing, no books),  bxra1 (saying that he's greedy), 11. qxd1 (this threatens the rh8 - wow, so i guess black's best option is 0-0. now it's white's turn to cash in with 12. dxnc6.   fen="r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/1bp5/4p3/5n2/p2b1ppp/q3k2r b k -"  now, black must choose between two lines:   a) 12... bxc6, 13. bxc6, rb8, (with a possible follow up as 14. o-o!?, bg4 -attacking-, 15. ne5 (threatening the fork nd7?), qxbd2, 16. nxbg4, rb2 17. a4, rf-b8, and black seems to have a good edge, despite material theoretical equalness.   "fen=1r4k1/p3pp1p/2b3p1/2p5/p3p1n1/8/1r1q1ppp/q4rk1 w - -"  b) ...or try to look for another move, waiting for a possible cxb7 with bxb7 (which white won't do, probably). keeping in mind, of course, all the complications if bg4...  back to a), let's imagine that after 13. rb8, white gets greedy, and wants to cash in an exchange by the mate threat 14. bh6. it seems that the only defence for black is f6, so we have:   "fen=1rbq1rk1/p3p2p/2b2ppb/2p5/4p3/5n2/p4ppp/q3k2r w k -"  once you see that 15. ng5 leads to nothing, i tried the simple one, 15. bxrf8. this could be a clear loss by black, so you would advise him not to play this. but black has another interesting move: 15. qa5.  would this move will be able to compensate black's exchange (or even full rook, if necessary)? looking at it, it seems black has a powerful attack, here. but can it lead to victory?  when these kind of situation happens in real games, i sink in a sea so deep that i often end with the wrong move (see my game with symbian, annotated, if you want to laugh at me :-(. )  ok, let's see:   "fen=1rb2bk1/p3p2p/2b2pp1/q1p5/4p3/5n2/p4ppp/q3k2r w k -"  i explored the logical 16. nd2. i cannot remember the line, but i couldn't find a clear win if black, instead of the natural kxbf8, goes ba6 (it smells like mate, but where's the roast-beef?), or tries to proceed harassing the bishop with rb6. anyway... let's see if white can afford 16. ke2... (it is only the last line of several dozens i found, and i can't swear it is the best...)  16. kd1 is a choice to be explored. the other is...  "fen=1rb2bk1/p3p2p/2b2pp1/q1p5/4p3/5n2/p3kppp/q6r b - -"  of course black goes on attacking, and very strongly, but hey: white is about to play bxd7, and then f6 gets fatally weak: black has no easy way to defend it. so, after all, white can go like that, after all, just to tempt - as to say - black to go on with the attack and getting unable to defend f6 after the storm is gone. for example:   16... ba6+, 17. ke3 (practically forced because white cannot affor the blac well... the previous message was cut by gk's unadvised limit of comment's lenght.   ok, i understand i cannow write an entire book on a position, but please, programmers, warn me first, please!!  it never mind. i just wanted to show whay happens to me when analyzing a particularly tactic postion like this. my life stops, and i frequently get lost. and this is the reason i don't play seriouslyu anymore (sigh!).  but the astonisching think is theory "must" have explored all these lines - for sure, and for sure "all this work is in vain", since if the world's champions don't go inte them, it must be that all this is so well known by them that both are sure they will get to an even position... and black prefers to go otherwise, overattacking c3, thus complicating even more the situation.   this amazes me. gelfand's preparation behind this move implies to have reviewed all the lines after bxc3+, white goes in (because he know he will survive and even get an advantage for the fork...  but black has this trick...   and the comments say that the game was not "such a big deal" (no literally, of course :-).   chess is exciting :-d   the last line of the previous message was:    10.	c1-d2	c3-a1 11.	d1-a1	e8-g8 12.	d5-c6	b7-c6 13.	b5-c6	a8-b8 14.	d2-h6	f7-f6 15.	h6-f8	d8-a5+ 16.	e1-e2	c8-a6+ 17.	e2-e3	a5-a3+ 18.	e3-f4	a6-c8 19.	f8-e7	g6-g5+ 20.	f3-g5	f6-g5+ 21.	f4-g5	c8-e6 22.	g5-h6	a3-b2 23.	e7-f6	b2-d2+  (i cannot decoy it again now!!!)  again, black goes beyond the natural bxc3+... and all this is theory.... of course, the chesc's momentum should be kept... i guess. white doesn't defend c3, nor attacks using the d pawn, but castles. if before bxc3 was not dangerous, why now it is necessary to castle? black doesn't try to defend c7 (what's wrong with bd7?), or save it by exchanging it (cxd5, exd5, bxc3), nor b (or q) x c3. he prefers this "naive" move, that would allow white to easily cover everything with bd2.  white choose an attacking move, again, keeping momentum. it seems that it white's best was - hey, vishy played it! - or is it all still theory? it was theory, until here. comments goes: "the contest’s most intriguing moment, superbly negotiated by the challenger, came on 14. d6! (setting a high-class trap) ra7!"   i would like to have time to find out exactly what is the "high-class trap" the comment refers to, but i have to work, to sleep... :-) having to assume that it is forced... "...15. bg5, when the plausible 15. … f6? runs into 16. rb8! and black may already be lost: 16. … 0-0 17. ne5!! exd6 (best; losing are 17. … fxg5 18. nxc6 qxc3 19. dxe7 re8 20. rxc8 rxc8 21. qd5+ kh8 22. qd8+ rxd8 23. exd8=q+ bf8 24. qxf8 mate, and 17. … fxe5 18. dxe7 re8 19. qb3+ kh8 20. qf7 raxe7 21. bxe7 and wins) 18. qb3+ kh8 19. nxc6 c4 20. qb2 qxg5 21. nxa7, and white is clearly better."  why not rb8 at once, then?  "but black finds 15. … exd6! 16. qxd6 rd7 17. qxc6 qc7, consolidating nicely. white’s attack peters out and in the final position, gelfand’s bishop pair give him a distinct edge. the challenger may regret later in the match playing on a few more moves in a position in which he could hardly have lost." this, again, seems to be a "naive" move, but if qc7, probably white wins with rb8... now he can, because white's queen is not on the good diagonal. why not o-o? because black is absolutely sure white has no better choice than to exchange queens and that he will survive the attack.  i guess rd1, o-o is not better.  oh, the forgotten and never taken c3! nobody was remembering it, right? and black, after the well prepared white's novelty, survives on a decent - or even advantageous - position. a psychological victory, for sure. scattered pawns, open game... all a delight for tactics, but there's not much left, to be truthful. black, again, finds a way to attack.  now black seems to have a pin, but the white knight escapes taking a pawn and threatening a rook. despite it, they decided to draw here the game! this is the move, i guess... again, i faced myself with a sea of complications. let's explore only one of them.  now, it seems to be logical for white to try to win a bishop with rc1, but bd4+ forces white to kh1 or bd3#. after it, black has at least a pepetual threat against the rook with the bishops.   white has to find a way to stop black's threats, and bc5 seems to be the one, or, probably better, bg3.  white has to save the knight, and black has the bishop's pair and a free pawn... somewhere i went wrong :-) white's nxc5 is under question again... is this a draw? :-) 
-------------------------------------
having said that, susan starts here with, "petroff again but 4. nf3 instead of nd3. this is more ambitious approach with 0-0-0" the whole idea is white will launch a kingside attack. this has the making of a very dynamic game!  giri played 11. rhe1 we are still in opening theory. but carlsen is thinking here. so perhaps he is trying to recall some special home prep to create chaos since 10...c5 is well known.  and caruana played immediately. in top level games, white won 1 and drew 3. here karjakin played 12. bg5. so did giri while sasikiran played 12. kb1. be prepared for some carlsen surprise soon i am quite surprised. why is carlsen thinking so much? we are still in opening theory. after  immediately. so they are following the sasikiran v miro game in st louis just a few weeks ago. carlsen cannot help himself. he wants to head to endgame immediately. no risk grinding! it seems that both sides are satisfied with what they have  preventing 15. ng5 sorry but this now has the making of a long boooooring game i am at a suite overlooking hyde park. but i am not in london for the world championship. i am here for other reasons  – at four seasons hotel carlsen opted for  with a direct threat of ng6 or nf5. things can get wild with 15... ng4 16. ng6 fxg6 17. rxe6 nxf2 18. rde1 nxd3 19. cxd3 bf6 20. rxd6  and immediately. that is what carlsen wants. long slow grind with microscopic advantage with no risk. ♟carlsen once again had nothing special prepared. he is like in an mma fight and his only objective is to get his opponent on the ground to grind something out, little chance of getting knocked out. ♟ – at four seasons hotel even if he can hold on to his title, carlsen will have big trouble holding on to his #1 ranking long term unless he modifies something. he cannot continue to hope that he can beat others all the time with this style. ♟  very disappointing! another simple draw. terrible for the fans! so the game had 99% chance of draw, and 1% of carlsen winning. is this the best approach for final white game in classical chess? carlsen thinks so and fans are frustrated. it is clear he wants rapid/blitz playoff. caruana decided that the easiest way to draw is to give up the c pawn to play out pawn down endgame with bishops opposite colors. he wants to prove that it would be a draw even with a pawn down. 
-------------------------------------
🤔 so far a repeat of game 8 caruana is cranking out moves at lightning speed. a deviation from game 8 which caruana played 12. bd2. once again, carlsen allowed caruana to unleash his home prep. i am still confused about carlsen's unwillingness to change his opening in spite of nearly losing before. if carlsen loses this match, his fans can question his strategy. it is like facing caruana alone was not fulfilling enough. he wants to face caruana+stockfish+supercomputer+teamofseconds. i still do not understand carlsen's ideas. he clearly played so much better, and have much more comfortable positions, when he took caruana out of his home preparation. so why continue to go to the lion's den and poke at the lion? 🦁 carlsen is ok in this position. the problem is it is so concrete, which is not carlsen's strength, and caruana is clearly in his preparation. so it is like fighting with your hands tied. now i expect 16...f5 is expected 17. a5 f4 18. bb6 qe8 += caruana is slightly better. ​we saw the same kind of stubborness from kasparov, one of the greatest players ever, against kramnik's berlin. it did not work out so well. so i am really confused about what carlsen is trying to prove? just as expected. now the bishop will go to b6.  if carlsen wins this match, i have to say that he is one brave "hombre" for his willingness (or stubborness) to take caruana's deep home preparation head on without fear! so he is either really brave or really crazy! we will see in the next 3 games! 🤣  is the only logical move. 18...nxb6 is not as good. 🤣 some players, like me, prefer to go around the brick wall in front of them, while others, like carlsen, like to punch a hole through it. power to him! that is why most guys do not have long nails :) ​one of the drawbacks for caruana is because he is so well prepared, and covered so many lines, it is hard to remember everything. this is why sometimes you see a long pause to try to recall the analysis. 🤔♟️this happens to all gms from time to time. hard to remember everything! this is so unexpected! now carlsen can try 19...qg6 followed by nf6 threatening e4 then kingside attack! carlsen is cautiously playing this move. he is thinking to himself what is the trick? why is caruana allowing me counter-attacking opportunity? well, the plan for carlsen is pretty clear. the idea is nf6, e4, and trying to do something on the kingside. i am not sure what is caruana's plan with 19. ra3, especially when there are no square for the rook in the kingside. that was a curious move for me. i guess we just have to sit back and see. there is a very interesting idea which may prove to be problematic for caruana! 20...b5! 21. axb6 rxa3 22. nxa3 nc5 black will have a very strong attack with bh3 coming!  if carlsen plays 20...b5 and win, it may go down as one of the bravest and most daring moves in world championship history. but if it does not work, he will have to move from norway to sweden or something. this is good too. i guess carlsen is not as crazy as me. this is a very important move, to get the king away from the potential pin on the g file. sorry for my sense of humor! sometimes my hungarian humor is hard to understand! :) now if 22. nb6 nxb6 23. bxb6 b4 24. rb3 bf6 and we have a very dynamic game. i still think 20...b5 would be a bit stronger because the white king would still be on g1 with the potential pin threat of the g file. but one move later is still better than sitting and waiting. if 22. axb6? then rxa3 23. nxa3 f3! and black is cruising along and a big ooops for white! so i think 22. nb6 is the only decent option for caruana here. now 23...b4 24. rb3 bf6 as i pointed out earlier will give carlsen excellent play. oh oh! carlsen blundered! giving up the b5 pawn is too premature and it does not work. white can simply take it, followed by re1 to clear the f1 square for the bishop to retreat to defend g2 pawn. black has nothing. oooops! all norwegian fans are praying that caruana will not take the bluff and not play bxb5! 🤔♟️ ​i can understand caruana's cautiousness before taking. he does not know if carlsen has something up his sleeves or not. it does look scary with the kingside attack, but a pawn is a pawn. it is not over as black still has plenty of play left. maybe too scary for caruana to take?🤔 caruana took the bluff and not take on b5**.  so now we know that carlsen is also a poker master, since he publicly said he likes playing poker with his friends! this is the most crucial game so far for both players. it can go either way, and a loss by either may be very costly. the biggest problem for both carlsen and caruana is the clock in a very complicated position. so we may see things decided by time pressure! ♟️hang on to your seats! carlsen should not allow bxb5 again. so b4 is important! i want to differentiate the merit of the position versus the practical aspect of the position. while technically white "may" be ok, in reality, it is very difficult to play as white because of the strong kingside attack. because of this, carlsen may have better chances. but of course with little time, either player can make horrific blunders. so very far from finality! very exciting for the fans though! 👏 i did not like 24. g3 at all. it creates all sorts of problems for caruana. it allows multiple threats such as f3 and bh3. black eventually can bring the rook to f6 then h6. too many problems! too hard to fend off everything! this is why i tried to explain and many fans simply refuse to believe. when players are in immense pressure, they start to see things that are not there. nerves can play tricks in humans' minds. if caruana is playing a 2000 player, he would not hesitate to capture on b5. white is still ok, but it does look scary. caruana is defending very well so far. he is one tough cookie! 😆 so now if 27...bxf1 28. qxf1 qxd5 29. rxb4 white has a passed a pawn, but black has a lot of pressure on the king. likely holdable for white providing no more mistakes. now black wants to put his queen on e6 to keep the qh3 threat going while clearing the square for d5. even the position is somewhat equal, i still prefer black, easier to play, especially with limited time. here is the deal. black should try to trade bishops but keep other pieces on. that would make it more difficult for caruana because of the king on h1 and g2 mate threat. this is where strong understanding of the position is important. black wants to trade bishops and keep everything else on the board. let's see if carlsen would do the same. again, technically speaking, the position is equal. but for humans, it is easier to play black, much less dangerous. with the bishop on the board, white can control the g1-a7 diagonal, harder for black to attack, potentially with d4, e4, e3 at some points. this game will probably end in a draw. but it is a surprisingly comfortable game for carlsen after the near disaster in game 8. caruana is still fine but he has to remain patient and accurate. this is a very important few moves for caruana before making the time control. he is not out of the woods yet. he needs h4 to avoid back rank problem. there are a still a few danger left 🤣 of course caruana found it. he is not #2 in the world for no reason. this is why this match has 9 draws so far. these guys are good! both sides made time control. the game will still likely head to a draw. and now it is important for white to defend with 42. ra6 and not rb3. and caruana found it again. very strong defender! the white king needs to be active. white cannot allow black to roam free without any consequence. one option for carlsen is to play g5 to try to block the white king in. so here is the news. the position is objectively equal. but black is the one pushing, and white is under pressure to be extremely accurate, the white king lacks mobility. the compensation is white has pawn on b6. ? ​i can't believe this. did he lose patience again? kd4 does nothing but create problems for himself. this is a complete gamble and he better hopes that it will not backfire. and of course caruana found it and now carlsen needs to sac a pawn hoping to hold 45... e3 46. ra4+ ke5 47. fxe3 rbxb6 48. rxb6 rxb6 49. kxf3 this is simply an unforced error on carlsen's part. i am sure now carlsen realizes that he is in deep trouble. and he has to be so accurate hoping to hold. this is what happens when you have a player in bad form. carlsen now has 3 huge problems: 1) his position is bad 2) caruana smells blood 3) the clock is his enemy. he has to try to put out the fire he created himself for no reason. ​many fans also questioned carlsen's strategy of spending so much energy on rest days for soccer. caruana is younger than him. he is fit. he is hungry. we will see if carlsen is correct with his game plan or not. we will see! ⚽️♟️ white can play c4 and after a series of trades, white will end up with a pawn up r + 3 ps vs r + 2 ps on the kingside. as i predicted, it will be 3 vs 2 on the kingside. carlsen found the best way to hold. and caruana offered a draw pawn up. he will not bother testing carlsen's endgame skill. 
-------------------------------------
caruana deviated on move 9. it is clear carlsen has no problem repeating moves. will caruana accept? caruana is telling carlsen that he came to play today! is this a decision he may regret? we will see! carlsen should just develop bishop to e7. but the game can get wild which i am not sure who will benefit more.  if carlsen loses this game, it is because of his stubbornness for refusing to deviate his opening. if he wins, he is right for not deviating and many of the chess pundits will swallow their pride carlsen did not want to go into the pawn sac line of 16...be7 17. qxb7. instead he went for   white is slightly better at this point. maybe the players will fight in game 12 after all. caruana simply cannot give away his last white game as the playoff will favor carlsen.  i do not see the official time clock, but it seems to me that caruana has spent a lot f time. it can mean 2 things: 1) he is out of book 2) nerves set in and he is being extra cautious as he knows that 1 mistake can cost him the title.  it is a tough decision for caruana now. what to do? he can try g3, f3, be2, kf2 then swing the h rook to c1. but then what. or he can take big risk by trying to do something on the kingside. this is why he is thinking. he is out of book and has to figure something out now. ♟ and carlsen immediately responded w/ this is a very uncomfortable situation for caruana. objectively speaking his position is fine. but carlsen is playing so fast. this can psychologically effect caruana because he does not know if this is still in carlsen’s prep caruana played as i suggested earlier. but carlsen immediately responded with  i am sure this is very confusing for caruana. carlsen is cranking out moves at lightning speed. the idea of nf8 is to go to d7 to help solidify the c5 square.  this is not a good home prep game for caruana as carlsen is clearly dictating the pace. so either carlsen thoroughly prepared for this or he is doing an amazing job bluffing caruana. we will see ♟ and carlsen should just continue with nd7. time may be a factor as carlsen is well ahead on the clock. the position is still objectively ok for caruana. ♟ now carlsen can retreat his bishop to g6 threatening f5 at some points.  exciting position but caruana must pay attention to his clock, especially in the next 5-10 moves. ♟ this is a move i did not consider. i like carlsen’s position. his plan should be bg6 then f5. he is also well ahead on time. as i said a few moves ago, this is the critical stage for caruana. complicated position, no real clear plan and well behind on the clock♟ we officially have a real brawl! as i predicted before the game, i have a feeling that somebody is going to win today. but who? nerves, nerves, nerves! that is what it will come down to. now the idea i mentioned bg6 then f5 looks really good! carlsen’s idea is clear with f5. for example if 23. rc2 f5 24. ng5 bxg5 25. hxg5 e4. black is on the attack while caruana has to be extremely careful as one slight inaccuracy can cost him the game. caruana is in big trouble! his king is vulnerable. b5 is coming soon after exf4. white’s position can crumble very quickly. ♟ this is not the best move imho. i believe that 25...exf4 or 25...b5 are both more accurate. the question is does carlsen have what it takes to convert. this seems to be a problem for him of late, missing opportunities. ♟ white has no counter-play on the kingside. black is building up, even though not the most efficient way, a lot of pressure on the queenside. the world championship is in carlsen’s hands if his nerves hold up. ♟ my internet kept dropping from 39,000 ft. this is one of the more disappointing ending. it seems that carlsen lost his ability to calculate and he also lost his nerves. there is no way to sugarcoat this. he offered a draw in a superior position after making inaccuracies. ♟ carlsen’s legacy has suffered a great deal. i cannot say 100% but most gms would never offer a draw with black, which has very little risk. this is simply shocking! ♟ all 12 games are drawn! this has to change! @fide_chess needs to change this rule! no draw offer should be allowed! there is no draw offer in , ping pong , boxing , mma & other sports. fighting draw is no problem. but not because one’s nerves is shot! am i wrong?  as i said in the beginning, the players will do what they think is best for them. they do not care about styles to please the fans. carlsen came into this game wanting a draw. he offered to repeat early on. caruana refused. then he offered draw in better position + more time! ♟  caruana would be crazy not to accept the draw offer in that position with such little time. since carlsen seems to have lost his ability to calculate deep lines, he is much more suited for faster time control where chess instinct is more important. that was the game plan.♟ based on statistics, carlsen is the favorite in faster time control. but after his mindset & clearly fragile nerves, caruana may surprise him, especially now that he’s just given a new chance. i can’t imagine any world champion, male/female, would offer a draw in that position.♟  
-------------------------------------
here we go, we have a repeat of game 1. the question is who will uncork the first novelty? very interesting psychological play by both players! game on! ​the first deviation is  instead of 6. h3. surprise!  it is nothing special chesswise, but clearly caruana did not want to repeat the potential problems of game 1.  it is interesting that carlsen played this right away. immediately, it is putting doubt in his opponent's head. carlsen wants to show that he expected 6. 0-0 and is fully prepared for it. so caruana now must think how to avoid possible home prep. a complete mind game! more common moves are 6...nf6 or 6...e5. after 7 re1 e5 the game is back to similar territory as with 6...e5. transposition of moves. caruana seems to have returned to his childhood favorite... back in 2004 he has played this same line, but there his opponent played 6...e5 [event "budapest fs06 im"] [date "2004.06.08"] [round "4"] [white "caruana, fabiano"] [black "martini, balazs"] [result "1-0"] [eco "b31"] [whiteelo "2140"] [blackelo "2289"]  1 e4 c5 2. nf3 nc6 3. bb5 g6 4. bxc6 dxc6 5. o-o bg7 6. d3 e5 7. be3 qe7 8. h3 nf6 9. nc3 o-o 10. a4 b6 11. nd2 nh5 12. a5 rb8 13. axb6 axb6 14. ne2 qc7 15. c3 nf4 16. bxf4 exf4 17. d4 rd8 18. nf3 qe7 19. qc2 g5 20. e5 be6 21. c4 h6 22. rad1 rd7 23. rd2 b5 24. cxb5 rxb5 25. nc3 rb4 26. dxc5 rxd2 27. qxd2 qxc5 28. re1 qb6 29. ra1 qb8 30. nd4 rxb2 31. qd3 qxe5 32. nxc6 qc5 33. ra8+ bf8 34. ne4 qxc6 35. qd8 qxa8 36. qxa8 rb1+ 37. kh2 rb4 38. nf6+ kg7 39. qa1 kg6 40. ne8 rb8 41. nc7 rb6 42. qa8 bg7 43. qg8 bd7 44. h4 gxh4 45. nd5 rf6 46. ne7+ 1-0 world championship play versus tournament play is so different. the preparation level for a 12-game match, or 14 in my match in 1996, is so much deeper and intense. there are a lot of guess work by both teams. the team with better guesses and better prep has big advantage!  the 8. a3 the idea is to prepare b2-b4 and after the exchange on b4, opening the a-file  more common is first 8. be3 b6 and then 9. a3. carlsen needs to make a decision: allow b2-b4 and just continue developing on the kingside or try to prevent it with a7-a5  now the logical follow up is 9. b4 it is too late to play 9. be3 as then black has 9...c4 and if 10. dxc4 nxe4. now we will see a completely different dynamic as in game 1. sacrificing (temporarily) the pawn on c5. interestingly even though we are out of official theory, but so far both sides are playing rather fast. if white captures the pawn with 10. bxc5, black will win the pawn back soon enough after 10...nd7 11. be3 and f5! followed by chasing the bishop away with f5-f4.  i prefer the white side here. it is a little easier to play, but of course far from anything decisive. carlsen spent quite a bit of time here. what to do? 10...cxb4, 10...nd7, 10...be6 or even 10...bg4. choices, choices!  the idea is to take some pressure off the e5 pawn. if 11. h3 then bxf3. the c8 bishop has very little play, so to exchange it for the knight on f3 is not a bad idea. white is slightly better in this position. perhaps carlsen will change his opening choice in game 5?  this is certainly a much better white game for caruana than game 1. it clearly seems to me that he got a hold of his footing after a strong game 2. even though there is no decisive result so far, the momentum has swung quite a bit. as expected, carlsen exchanged his bishop for the knight. one of the things i do not understand sometimes in world championship play is why some players insist of repeating the same opening choices? this is another underwhelm opening choice for carlsen.  this is basically survival mode. carlsen hopes to trade a lot of pieces off to hold the endgame. he needs to mix things up drastically in the next few games. the missed opportunity in game 1 now looms larger. having said that, caruana needs to find a way to convert while carlsen is still wobbling. otherwise, the momentum will shift back. sometimes, 1 move in 1 game can change the entire outcome of a match this important!  unless one has played in long classical world championship matches, it is hard for most chess players to understand the importance of psychology, home preparation, momentum, and other rarely seen off the board factors.  carlsen has a big edge in match experience, but caruana has adjusted very well after a shaky game 1. big kudos to his team for preparing him nicely. this now has become a really interesting psychological battle.  caruana will try to put his bishop on c3 and queen on b2 to put pressure on both e5 and b7 pawns.  white is slightly better and has a more comfortable position, it should be hold-able for carlsen.  what to do? white is better. white has space advantage. white has better pawn structure. but how to take advantage of it? this is what carlsen is counting on. black can sit back and defend.  black can play almost anything and still is ok. 18...h5, 18...bf8, 18...b5 one thing caruana must keep in mind is carlsen is very resourceful. he has no problem playing slightly inferior positions. therefore, caruana must develop strong patience and not wears himself out like foreman vs ali "rumble in the jungle'.  now, it seems that white got nothing out of the slight advantage. this is now practically equal. but caruana must not fall asleep here as carlsen can be very dangerous in this type of "boring" positions. he became a world champion because of his ability to grind.  it is a big sigh of relief for carlsen as he is no longer in any danger. he can just relax and grind. as i said in my pre-match assessment, caruana is superior in opening prep but carlsen is better positionally. objectively, the position is equal now. carlsen can force the trade of queens if he wants to 22... qa2 23. qb2 qxb2 24. bxb2 f6 = look at that! carlsen is following the suggestion. maybe i should type quieter so carlsen won't hear? :) this is a quiet signal that they are ok with a draw in peace  this is now 99.99% draw, unless someone falls asleep and loses on time.  the position should result in a draw. but i am afraid carlsen will play on a while to burn off some anger that he got outplayed in the opening again.  carlsen has nothing. all he is doing is trying to grind hoping that caruana will get careless. seriously, neither side has anything here.  while most grandmasters would take a draw here, look at what carlsen is doing. he is slowly provoking caruana. he has no problem doing little poking for hours and hours. the problem is many will fall asleep mentally and lose to him. it is like some sort of hypnotism. you may see something like bd6 then g5. he wants to create either a passed pawn, or creating a stand alone pawn for white on a dark square. this is why white has to be alert. these little moves can prove to be a pain down the line.  to be clear, caruana is not losing. but this does not stop carlsen from trying to win.i personally believe caruana made a small psychological mistake by agreeing to a draw too early in game 2. he should have played out that drawn endgame to send a message to carlsen that 2 can play same game. black has to consider the following: is it better for him to trade off knights, bishops, both, or keep everything, each scenario can change the dynamic of the game. this is a difficult decision for most amateur or club players.  even though the game should still end in a draw, the momentum of the game has shifted. now it is carlsen who is the one to do the pushing and caruana the one who is defending. even within a game, you can see the momentum going up and down. look at that! the lazy kings now want to get into the action. black can try to make a play on the queenside or kingside. it is he who is dictating the pace now. you are witnessing the beauty of chess (if you like this type of chess). black faked it on the queenside. as soon as the white king shifted to the queenside, black made a play on the kingside. still draw but this is a good lesson for club players. some were asking me if caruana should offer a draw. the answer is no. he knows carlsen will not accept and it shows sign of weakness. you do not want to do that against carlsen.  look at what happened? in just a few moves, carlsen managed to do this. white now has 4 pawns on dark squares while black has only 1. even though in this position it may not mean much, in some others, that can be lethal. endgame lesson for club players. remember what i said before? carlsen was thinking about what to trade off. now he sees that white has 4 pawns on dark squares, he traded his knight for bishop so he can exploit them, then bring his king in on the queenside. this is a master at work folks!  ​this is a very good endgame lesson for the average club players. even it may not be enough to win, you can see the deliberate effort from carlsen to slowly change the dynamic of this game. he is working to shift every little possible advantage to his side. white now must bite back by creating some counter play not to allow the black king to freely roam down the queenside. this is the blueprint to draw. white cannot afford to play defensively.  speaking from personal experience in world championship matches, this is where caruana and his team must find a solution. he got excellent positions out of the openings in the last 2 games with nothing to show for it. what went wrong? how to improve. this is why you have a team of seconds. this is the right plan. caruana wants his knight on the more flexible e3 square. this game is still heading to a draw. but carlsen enjoys this type of maneuvering. so i expect another long game. and this is why i said fitness is so important. long games is expected.  another shift in the position. now carlsen has just created a passed pawn for himself. but caruana is fine as long as he is making plays on the kingside.  this is the correct play by caruana. this is why he is #2 in the world and the rightful challenger to carlsen.  excellent defense by caruana. game 4 tomorrow!  in case if you are wondering, black's bishop in on the wrong corner. so all white has to do is put his king on h1 and draw. black cannot make progress so draw. i really try not to go into the detail computer lines. anyone can read those things off their engines. i am trying to give you more from my personal world championship experience, and the thinking and maneuvering from both players. hope you do not mind! that's my coaching side!

these guys really want to prove something! men!  #carlsencaruana  this is the first change from fabiano's previous white games in this match. in games 1 and 3 he played 4.bxc6  the last time magnus faced this off-beat gambit line was in 2005!

 this is an important intermediate move. otherwise white would have lost the initiative. caruana is playing pretty fast. so it is clear that he is still in his book. carlsen is slowly trying to figure out how to avoid the pitfalls in the caruana dangerous opening web!  a possible continuation 9... rxa1 10. bxa1 d6 11. bxc5 ne7 12. cxd6 qxd6  carlsen is following the line i suggested. he has to be a little patient dealing with the double b pawn. but with correct play, he should be ok. it is interesting to see the pace of caruana. he is playing extremely fast no matter how carlsen tried to deviate. this is world championship mind-games at the highest level. this speed can really put doubts in the opponent's mind.  i do not envy magnus at the moment. he has clearly walked in to fabiano's home prep. and this line is a lot sharper and more concrete than some of the previous games we have seen in this match. 12. qe2 this was a novelty compared to an earlier game (12. cxd6 qxd6 13. d4 exd4 14. bxd4 o-o polschikov, a (2270) - anoshkin, a (2386) pardubice 2007 where black had no problems).  ​something like this would lead to an equal position 13... qa5 14. cxd6 be6 15. qc7 qxc7 16. dxc7 nc6.  carlsen once again followed the move i suggested and with correct play, he can equalize and hold in spite of getting into caruana's book. he is not a world champion for no reason  carlsen is like 007. he knows how to get out of trouble  both players are following the variation i suggested above. i think carlsen is out of trouble and his position should be ok now. caruana's is finally thinking. that could only mean 2 things: 1) he is trying to remember his analysis 2) he is out of his opening prep. so now, play ball, mano a mano!  they are still following exactly what i suggested. first, caruana sacrificed a pawn. now carlsen gave back the pawn and sacrificed a pawn. he will have no problem winning the c7 pawn back. i must have had a crystal ball  position is equal  after nc6 to defend the e5 pawn, black will recapture the pawn on c7. no problem at all.  now carlsen cannot take on c3. this will give caruana an extra tempo with 18. nxc3 and the knight can defend the c7 dangerous pawn. therefore, carlsen must ignore and play 17...kd7 18. cxb4 ra8 =  i think 17. rd1 or 17. d4 would have been a little better. now, carlsen has consolidated his position, have a dangerous bishop pair, and a comfortable endgame.  now i like carlsen's position better. it is easier to play. he has more than enough compensation for the temporary sacrificed pawns. all of a sudden, the tide has turned. after an inferior 17. c3, caruana now has a problem finding good squares for his pieces. he has to be extremely careful and it is now carlsen's turn to strike back. the momentum has shifted after the promising opening surprise. after 18...ra8, caruana is spending a lot of time. he now realizes that in spite of being temporarily up 2 pawns, he could be in trouble. the best move now is 19. bc3 but then his knight has no place to go. a big mess! so the cause is 17. c3 his pieces are in a tight space. the instinctive move to try to free up the d2 square for the knight on b1 may not be perfectly timed. i think caruana was better suited to play more actively with 20. rc1 threatening the e5 pawn due to the pin, or perhaps 20. ng5. now, if carlsen finds 20...b5, he will block the b4 pawn, and in a few moves, he can take it after f6 defending the e5 pawn, then bf8. then white will have problems dealing with the passed b pawn and black's bishop pair.  wow! i cannot believe that was what carlsen played after spending so much time for this move. this is the key difference between carlsen at his peak and the carlsen now. he was so much more lethal then with this type of position. i would really be interested to find out what went on in carlsen's mind not to play 20...b5, eventually winning back the b4 pawn, and have a passed b pawn with a pair of bishop supporting it! a real big miss for carlsen here!  now caruana will have time to consolidate and hold.  in chess, just like in other sports, momentum is so important. neither of these 2 players "float like a butterfly or sting like a bee" so far in this match. it is more like float like a hippo and sting like a mosquito.  the good news is neither has made a big leap so far so the match is still even. this shows the tremendous pressure these players are facing in a world championship. it is much easier for the fans to watch at home.  i remember the emotions i had to overcome in the first few games in my world championship match in 1996. after i got the momentum, it was crushing the rest of the way. so the one who scores first in this match will have a huge boost.  ​black cannot really take advantage of the backward d3 pawn with rd8 yet because of be3+ followed by rd1.   so now i expect 22. be3+ now there is an interesting possibility of 22... kb5 23. nc3+ kxb4 24. nd5+ bxd5 25. exd5 rxd526. rb1+ kc3 27. rxb7 nd8 28. rc7+ kxd3. carlsen will be up a pawn but caruana will have no issue holding this game. the players followed my suggested line. caruana should be able to hold this game in spite of being a pawn down. carlsen must be careful even though he is a pawn up. his king may be trapped after white plays g4 cutting the escape route back to f5. therefore, caruana has enough compensation for the pawn down. i think carlsen missed this completely. he can be in the real danger zone! carlsen correct played  to prevent white from playing g4.  to once again threatening g4. carlsen is giving back a pawn. as expected, the game ended in a draw.

yes! it will be a battle today, hopefully!  this is rare move and a new fashion in search for something different against the super solid petrov.  just a couple month ago caruana faced it against so: [event "6th sinquefield cup 2018"] [site "saint louis usa"] [date "2018.08.27"] [round "9.1"] [white "so, w."] [black "caruana, f."] 1 e4 e5 2. nf3 nf6 3. nxe5 d6 4. nd3 nxe4 5. qe2 qe7 6. nc3 nf6 7. b3 nc6 8. bb2 bf5 9. nf4 o-o-o 10. qxe7 nxe7 11. o-o-o ng6 12. bd3 bd7 13. nxg6 hxg6 14. ne4 nxe4 15. bxe4 g5 16. h3 c6 17. c4 be6 18. bf3 d5 19. d3 f6 20. rhe1 bf7 21. cxd5 bxd5 22. bxd5 rxd5 23. re8+ rd8 24. rxd8+ kxd8 25. re1 bc5 26. f3 re8 27. re4 kd7 28. kc2 bd6 29. a4 a6 30. bc3 b5 31. bb2 re6 32. bc3 re8 33. bb2 re6 34. bc3 re8 35. bb2 re6 1/2-1/2 the players are cranking out these early moves! both are well prepared! let's see if carlsen and his team have a novelty somewhere for caruana! this seems to be a novelty. in the only other gm game in my database that reached the position after 6.nf4, black went for the endgame with 6...nf6 [event "71st ch-rus hl 2018"] [site "yaroslavl rus"] [date "2018.07.04"] [round "8.5"] [white "motylev, a."] [black "rakhmanov, ale"] 1 e4 e5 2. nf3 nf6 3. nxe5 d6 4. nd3 nxe4 5. qe2 qe7 6. nf4 nf6 7. d4 qxe2+ 8. bxe2 nc6 9. c3 g6 10. f3 bg7 11. h4 h5 12. na3 ne7 13. nb5 kd8 14. kf2 a6 15. na3 b6 16. bc4 rf8 17. nc2 bb7 18. ne3 kd7 19. a4 bc6 20. rd1 bh6 21. nd3 bxe3+ 22. bxe3 bd5 23. b3 bxc4 24. bxc4 nf5 25. bf4 ng8 26. c5 nxh4 27. cxd6 cxd6 28. c4 nf5 29. c5 h4 30. cxb6 nge7 31. rab1 nd5 32. bd2 rab8 33. b7 nfe7 34. rdc1 nc6 35. nf4 nce7 36. rh1 nxf4 37. bxf4 nd5 38. rxh4 kc6 39. rc1+ kd7 40. rb1 kc6 41. bg3 rfe8 42. rhh1 f5 43. rbc1+ 1/2-1/2 magnus is playing it super safe. clearly still in his preparation. caruana is a well known expert in the petroff. no one seems to be able to crack it so far. so unless carlsen has something well prepared, it will be very hard to beat caruana with his pet opening. caruana is making the petroff fashionable like kramnik did it with the berlin! it looks like carlsen will attempt to squeeze water from stone again. black has no opening issues here. rock solid! i am not sure what carlsen and his team have prepared for the match. i have not seen formidable novelties or anything which can cause caruana to break a sweat. it seems that he once again relies on his superior middlegame and endgame play. but that is not enough so far. black can just develop his bishop e7 then 0-0 and he has no problem whatsoever with this game. and still nothing! caruana's position is like rock solid wall.  the fans need to remember that carlsen is in no pressure to win this match in 12 games. if the score is tied 6-6 (maybe 12 draws), then the players will have a playoff with rapid, blitz, etc. this will heavily favor carlsen. so basically he has a big draw odd. so the pressure is on caruana to win in regulation! it is clear that carlsen cannot allow black to play h4. that can be uncomfortable for white has he cannot move his h1 rook. and if h3 then the g3 square becomes problematic.  the players seems to be content to move the pace at glacier speed so far in this game.  the problem is how to break through or make progress without big risks? so for example, if black plays 20...ne7 to defend the f5 square, what can white do? one has to admire caruana's preparation and work ethic. he has always been a very hard worker ever since i knew him back when he was 6 years old. he is the example of how to maximize his talent through hard work.  caruana started playing rated chess at my chess center in ny. he won just 1 game out of 4 in his 1st ever tournament. he went home to train harder, came back and scored 1 win out of 3 in his 2nd tournament against tougher competition. he kept on improving and not giving up. so finally, will we see the position opening up and maybe some actions?  this type of position is very difficult for many players, especially club players. when to break, when to exchange pawns, and to shift the dynamic of the position to favor you. i have news for you. it is hard for the grandmasters too! black has a very strong f5 square. i think carlsen needs to start trading some minor pieces before the position becomes dangerous. caruana's pieces are better placed. if this is the best white can get then it is an opening success for black. carlsen may want to trade his dark square bishop. so perhaps 27. bg5 f6 then 28. bf4 just to provoke f6. he wants his own knight on f4.  same idea of trading the dark square bishop. but i prefer black's pawn to be on f6 instead of f7.  all of sudden, the white bishop on b3 has limited squares to go to. caruana has to be really happy with his position. to have this position in the 1st of 2 consecutive black games is great!  ​i am curious to know the mindset of carlsen's team up to now. they surely cannot be happy with the type of positions he has been getting out of the openings. it is clear that team caruana has done a better job with opening preparation. but because carlsen is so good, he is doing fine so far. black does not want to trade, especially the dark square bishop. he wants to maintain the pressure. it is much easier to play with the black side now. carlsen has to go into holding this game mode as white has no concrete plan to play for any kind of advantage. as i said a few moves earlier, it is in carlsen's interest to trade some minor pieces off. otherwise, caruana may have to much play. but as you can see, caruana is wise not to trade. he thinks he has chances to play for a win here, or at least at no risk.  it would be crazy for anyone to suggest that carlsen is happy with his current position with white. i am sure that it is a disappointment for him so far in this game, and a draw will be good here for carlsen. to be clear, white is not losing here. but it is simply much more comfortable to play black with the space advantage and better piece placement. one way to simplify the position for white to hold is 30... nd6 31. rxc8 rxc8 32. rc1 rxc1 33. bxc1  here is another way to simplify. that is very important for carlsen to trade down pieces. he is very smart to do so. black still has a more comfortable position but carlsen is making it a little easier to hold now. even though things look less difficult now, carlsen still needs to be extra careful. there are still some weakness he has to deal with such as the d4 and a2 pawns. but it sure is a lot less complicated than a few moves earlier. if​ 34... be6 35. nc2 bc3 36. be2 bxd4+ 37. nxd4 nxd4 38. be3 and potentially we can have a bishop opposite color endgame with white down a pawn but draw. white still has issues with the a2 pawn. carlsen could try this 36. bd3 be6 37. nc2 bb2 38. a4 na2 39. ke1 nc1 40. bxc1 bxc1 but he has to allow caruana to have the bishop pair. carlsen took a lot of time for the last few moves. he knows that this is a critical moment for him as there is danger lurking around with the a2 and d4 pawn.  caruana is in good shape. he is the one putting on a tremendous amount of pressure against carlsen, who is clearly in survival mode here. even if caruana does not win, it has to give him a big boost knowing that his beloved petroff worked gloriously. carlsen is willing to give up his light square bishop against the black knight to alleviate some pressure against his a 2 pawn. it is not easy being a world champion. carlsen has business obligations, commercial meetings, appearances, meeting with sponsors, etc. this took away a lot of his training time. in spite of this, he held his title since 2013. but the gap is closing! so soon he will have to make a hard choice of finding a better balance. here is a decision caruana has to make. to take on a2 or to go after the d4 pawn, or maybe both eventually? i would personally go after the d4 pawn with 40...ne4+ caruana also chose the d4 pawn.  both players made time control. caruana still maintains his small edge and a much easier position to play. the glaring problems for carlsen are black's d pawn, as well as his own a2 pawn. clearing the way for the d pawn to march forward. carlsen should make a mental note to himself. no more 1 e4 against caruana! no more petroff!  after a long thought, carlsen decided on now caruana has to move his knight away to d2 and not allow the trade. brilliant sequence by carlsen. he gave up a piece for a bunch of pawns hoping to simplify things to draw. black had to stop the queenside pawns from advancing to give time for the knight to swing over to capture the pawns. white only has one goal, to trade off all the pawns. if he can do it, he will hold. black's main objective is to try to hang on to at least 1 pawn.  i am sure carlsen and his team are sweating now. even it is hard and quite long, it is possible to black to win. this is caruana's best chance of the match so far. it will be devastating for carlsen to lose with the white pieces. carlsen correctly gave up his b pawn to save the a pawn. still a lot of work and maybe even some luck to hold. not an easy endgame to win, and also not an easy endgame to hold. but these are the two best players in the world and here is their chance to prove it. clearly this is caruana's best chance in the match so far.  caruana can go after the h4 pawn with 54...be1 again the objective for both sides is simple. white must try to trade all black's pawns to hold. black must try to hang on to at least one pawn to try to win. this is the key battle. another factor is time. white's mission is clear and not very difficult to find moves. but black has to be so accurate to maintain winning chance. so time may come into play later on. white has no chance to win. he is fighting to survive! black is the only one with chances to win here.  this endgame is very complicated. but it is fitting for a closely contest world championship like this one. i think it is too hard for most players, including grandmasters.  so carlsen gave up his last pawn on the queenside to fulfill his objective. now he is banking on his h pawn while putting pressure on the f6 pawn forcing black to use a piece to guard it. it does not seem that caruana has figured out how to win this. carlsen has done a magnificent job trying to hold this. we may have to take the title of "minister of defense" from karjakin and give it to carlsen if he succeeds. and caruana must be scratching his head saying "what do i have to do to win a game?"  full disclosure: i have no idea who to win as black here either. i cannot find any viable line! the problem is black's king is cut off to the g file. and black cannot win the h or f pawn without help. so we are going around in circles without progress!  not so easy to dethrone a champion!  caruana is still trying. white has to remember to block the black king from getting to either g8 or g7.  still no progress ​one scenario i could see if black will go after the f pawn, allowing the h pawn to go to h6. then black will sac his bishop for the pawn. that would lead to n+p v b but that is still a draw as carlsen can sac his bishop for the pawn. this is like caruana offering a draw because it is a dead draw. and they took a draw! this is a huge escape by carlsen, mr. houdini himself!  
-------------------------------------
smart move! so far as in game 2 still as game 2 the first deviation from game 2 where magnus played 10.rd1. most common responses are 10...be7 or 10...bb4 but caruana instantly responded with it is a less popular move than 10...be7 or 10...bb4, but it clearly aims to prevent potential forks with b2-b4 or nd2-b3.  ​most likely magnus and his team focused their preparation on the more popular responses to 10.nd2, so maybe after the rarely seen 10...qd8 he is out of his "book" at this point and is taking his time. it is logical. if white would have made a quiet developing move such as 11.be2 black would get the initiative after 11...d4.  in my database, 11...be7 12.rd1, white went 6-0! so it is a smart move for caruana to find a different option. 11...bb6 a new move according to the database.  some are wondering why players do not analyze everything. the answer is simple. it is physically impossible to analyze everything & especially memorize everything! neither player knows what the opponent will play. so it is the job of the players and their seconds to guess wisely! another logical development to prepare 0-0. this opening choice is much more suitable for carlsen, a big improvement over game 6. white is slightly better because of the backward bishop on c8. now let's see how he can take advantage of this. there are a lot of attractions from the non-traditional chess fans for this world championship. my twitter commentary had around 533,000 twitter impression during game 6. people are intrigued because these 2 are quite different in every way. just clearing the d8 square potentially for the rook. carlsen's team has to be very excited as he has obtained a "normal" position that is not in the caruana's wheelhouse. they believe carlsen is superior in the middlegame phase if he does not have to face against super software and super hardware behind caruana's home prep. i personally do not like this move. very strange. i prefer 13. rd1 or 13. 0-0. white is fine, it is not a blunder, but i prefer other choices. it is encouraging psychologically for carlsen when caruana has to think. this is exactly carlsen wants to see. he is not afraid of caruana. he is just afraid of caruana's notorious and lethal home preparation!  ​this is precisely why bobby fischer advocated for fischer random so there would be no 60-move deep opening analysis. this is why bobby and i spent countless hours working on and perfecting all the fischer random rules people play with today. after thinking for a long time, caruana played  now i like 14. nd2 to capture the c4 pawn with the knight. carlsen agreed with this move choice. the knight is more suited on c4 than b3.  now caruana needs to play 14...ne5. he needs to be precise and not so passive, especially with his bishop sitting on c8. even though white is only slightly better, it is much easier to play white in this position. caruana did indeed play it is important to understand that if you have a cramp position, it is good to trade pieces to open up squares. therefore, eventually if white plays nc4, black can at least trade the knights and the c6 square freed up for the c8 bishop. now caruana is trying to bring his last undeveloped bishop out. both players are just making logical moves. amateur players can learn a lot from this. make sure pieces are developed, king is safe, control the center, etc. simple chess rules!  carlsen is following another rule of chess. if you have space advantage and your opponent's position is more cramped, do not trade pieces to maintain advantage. so carlsen chases the knight away so he can capture on c4 without any exchange of pieces. now pieces are developed for both sides. symmetrical pawn structure. this will be a long middlegame struggle with very little chance for advantage. for most, it would be a disappointment to get so little out of white, normal for carlsen. the strategy for this game is like nadal v djokovic at french open tennis. they are just going to sit back on the baseline and play out long long long baseline rallies. so if you want fast pace action, watch wimbledon  pieces coming off the board. this game is heading for a slow draw.  caruana is trading everything he can. he is telling carlsen to prove his endgame skill. no gm in this level should lose in such a position. so i expect caruana to go i nto game 8 tomorrow with the score 3.5 - 3.5. well, carlsen can try f3, kf2 and eventually ne5. he can slowly try to do something, but 99.999999% the game will end in a draw. carlsen will now work toward trading queens. that would result in knight v bishop endgame, a slight imbalance. as long as caruana keeps queens on the board, he has nothing to worry about.  still equal. the difference now is both sides need to be careful as both have pawn weaknesses. we must feed this position into super computers again because i do not know how to win with either color!  now will they repeat moves with 38. kf3 ba6 39. ke3 bf1?   
-------------------------------------
no more rossolimo! magnus chose the famous sveshnikov variation of the sicilian!  the 7.bg5 line is most popular, but this is interesting with significant theory behind it  another option like 8...ne7 is ok. they are cranking out moves like they are late for dinner! the old main line was 9.c4 (which i faced multiple times as black back in 1980s), but this is the more modern way to play. this is a fresh idea compared to the often tried 12.kh1 or 12.a5. i have only four games in my database with 12. bd2, all played with the past year. white did well 2 wins and 2 draws. because this is a relatively new move, carlsen immediately took his time.   there is only game that has reached this position: [event "mitropa cup 2018"] [date "2018.06.03"] [round "4.1"] [white "huschenbeth, n."] [black "hracek, z."] [result "1/2-1/2"] [eco "b33"] [whiteelo "2571"] [blackelo "2582"]  13 a5 nf6 14. be3 bd7 15. nxa7 f4 16. bb6 qe8 17. f3 bd8 18. c4 bxb6+ 19. axb6 qd8 20. qb3 nh5 21. c5 dxc5 22. nc6 qf6 23. ra7 ng3 24. re1 nxe2+ 25. rxe2 bxc6 26. rxa8 rxa8 1/2-1/2 ​once again, caruana and his team are very well prepared!  white is eyeing the b6 square at one point. both sides came to play today. to carlsen's credit, not many choose sicilian as he main weapon in recent world championships. but caruana is too sound with his opening preparation. so it will be interesting how this game will turn out. the biggest problem for carlsen is he is really the underdog. he is not only playing against caruana alone. he is also playing against caruana's team of seconds, stockfish and super computers. from the time on the clock, it seems that caruana is still in his element. while black is objectively ok here, in reality, carlsen is in real pressure. he has no idea what else caruana had cooked up at home. so he is trying to figure things out over the board knowing one mistake can cost him the world championship title. carlsen's struggle is real! one thing that really surprises me is why so many players insisting on repeating the same opening choice over & over again in world championship matches. we saw how that worked out with kasparov versus kramnik as well as other matches. this plays into opponents' preparation advantage. why not mix things up? the biggest problem here is this is not carlsen's style. can he do it? yes. but that is not the strongest area of his game. but this plays right into caruana's wheel house. this is why home preparation does matter! i already read some online comments of how arrogant carlsen is for playing 1...c5 for 4 games in a row. i am not sure if i would go that far, but it is questionable to allow your opponent to simply uncorking home preparation at will is either very brave or very crazy! if carlsen wins, people will say he is a genius for allowing this. if he loses, people will question his stubborness. what is your opinion?   on the surface, things look "dangerous" for carlsen because his kingside is exposed. we will see how he plans to address it. 20. bc3 is logical. carlsen can try to put his bishops on f5 and f6 to somewhat shield his king and consolidate. but white is still doing good, especially because this type of position/this style favors caruana. same as in tennis. can nadal, djokovic, connors and borg...serve nd volley? yes, but their strength is at baseline. can mcenroe, edberg, and becker...win at the baseline? on some points, yes, but strength is at the net. just as in this game. carlsen can play sharp stuff but it is not his strength. after spending a lot of time, carlsen played my suggested idea the problem is now white can play 21 c5 right away. something like this could be annoying for black: 21. c5 bf6 22. c6 qc7 23. rc1 carlsen cannot possibly be pleased with his position.  or 21. c5 nxf3+ 22. qxf3 dxc5 23. rae1 with a strong advantage. caruana did it!  now 23. rae1 with big advantage! i think we may have a winner and new world #1 today! this is the best practical chance for caruana in this match so far!  carlsen has 2 big problems: 1) white's d pawn and 2) the weak a1-h8 diagonal!  i personally prefer 23. rae1 and not rad1. i think it is more forceful. but white is still considerably better here. just my preference  the one hope for carlsen is this is a very concrete position tactically. so one slight inaccuracy can let the opponent back in the game. this is what carlsen is hoping for because with accurate play, i think it is finito! and  is inaccurate. 24. nc4 is much stronger. white has no time to be laid back. nc4 stops the queen from getting to the kingside for support. now carlsen has a new lifeline! after playing 24. h3 too quickly to allow 24...qe8 and let black into the game, now caruana is thinking. the problem is this golden opportunity may be gone. white has compensation but down a pawn and black has bishop pair. now but it does not have the same sting. with bishops opposite colors, the game will likely head to another draw. white is still slightly better in spite of being a pawn down because of black's king safety issue and pawn structure. but this is more likely to head into a draw then before when caruana could have dominated to potentially bring home a full point! carlsen can play  28. qxf4 qxf4 29. rxf4 h3 and likely draw with queens off the board. to win a world championship, you have to beat the champion and earn it. so many came so close but failed. you have to be able to take full advantage of opportunities and close things out. karjakin learned the hard way, so did many others. caruana has to hope for another chance!  as expected. this will be another draw. sorry folks but i call things like they are, just with a bit of humor  i have to be objective and not favor either side. may the best player with strongest nerves win! that is all we can ask for!  soon both pairs of rooks may be off the board which will result in a definite draw. the simplest may be just kf7 followed by re8.  caruana can try to avoid trading rooks but it should still be a draw. caruana just cannot offer a draw here. he has to try. but the position is practically a draw unless someone make a monumental boo-boo! and carlsen can play 35...re2 36. rb6 bc8 still draw. in fact, there are just so many ways for black to hold here, relatively without much effort. this is like offering a draw, to give up the d pawn for the c pawn. 101% draw! i think we can sum up this game with 1 move 24 h3? if caruana would have played 24 nc4 or 24 qh5, the outcome would have been different. they key idea is not to allow black time to consolidate. h3 was simply too passive & slow. at this level, you cannot give opponent 2nd chance!     
-------------------------------------
we once again have the english! so far following game 4 of the match the first change from game 4 where carlsen played 9. bd2. this is already practically new territory (except for one game by some lower rated players according to my database) 9... nxc3 10. bxc3 f6 11. bc1. nothing seems to surprise caruana so far as he is moving at lightning speed. ⚡️ this has a strong psychological impact on his opponent as he is saying: "is this all you got? you can't surprise me!" 😂♟️ interesting retreat with the bishop. there are 2 reasons for this: keep the d2 square open for a potential knight-maneuver with nf3-d2-c4 and try to employ the bishop via a3 after advancing the pawn to a4. it also gives support to the d4 square eventually. so far this home prep by carlsen has a better psychological impact than on the actual board. he has not much in the game but this keeps away from caruana's home prep. so a moral victory of sort. objectively speaking, carlsen has nothing. but caruana is out of home prep and he is thinking for the first time so far in this game. that is what carlsen is banking on. he believes he is better than caruana in the middlegame. as for the women's world championship, it looks like lagno is on her way to be the next women's world champion! she held a very difficult position today. all she needs is a draw tomorrow with white to win the match! ​after 13. d4 caruana thought for a long time before finally playing  long enough for the british to have afternoon tea. surprisingly, carlsen immediately responded with now caruana is thinking again. at high level chess, nerves, self confidence & mental toughness play major roles. this is why sometimes you see players in the 2600's losing to players in the 2800's in "objectively drawn" positions, ones where they can draw weaker/same strength players with their eyes closed. this is an equal but unbalanced position. so let's see what carlsen can do. i do not expect much though. ? what is this about? i do not get it? is this a real move or broadcast error? this move does not smell good. carlsen now has 2 good replies: 18. qb3+ and 18. bxf3 both moves will potentially lead to an edge in opposite color bishop endgame. 17...bxf3? does not cause an immediate loss. however, it makes his equal position more complicated for no reason. this is kind of inexplicable for me. 🤔 equal materials and bishop opposite colors. but the a and c pawns are isolated. white is slightly better and can play on forever without risks. black believes that he can hold. what carlsen will play for is the lack of mobility of the b6 bishop and c7 pawn. but it is a long long way from "winning". white can only continue to grind hoping for more inaccuracies. i am curious to know what caruana was thinking taking on f3. why? while he can probably hold, why complicate things and give carlsen any confident for the final 4 games? carlsen has the draw odd with the fast time control playoff. why give him a mental boost? now that black bishop is stuck on b6, white can try to weaken the kingside with h4-h5-h6 stopping h5. it is not a straight forward position. but carlsen can basically do whatever he wants while caruana has to sit back and hold. much more comfortable to play white, and easier on the clock as well. carlsen keeps on moving forward. this is vintage carlsen. while it may not give a "win", he keeps on compounding pressure on his opponent hoping that eventually someone will "crack" under pressure! their styles are so different. there is no really "concrete" way for carlsen to win. all he is trying to do is create more "weaknesses" to make it difficult for caruana to defend everything. it is like how to defend the entire great wall of china? which part? where? all of caruana's pawns are isolated pawns. so in spite of black being a pawn up, it is white who is trying to win by trying to exploit the weaknesses. carlsen may not succeed but his ideas are quite clear and easy to understand. 😂 now for caruana, he has to play aggressively and fight back. he cannot just sit back and defend. if all pieces are off the board except for the bishops and pawns, it is 100% draw. so he can trade rooks or give back the pawn with h4 but open up the g file. this is the correct plan. he has to punch back and not allow himself to become a piñata. i think carlsen's h5 was a bit too premature. he could have improved his position and not much caruana could do to really improve his position. so no need to rush h5 by allowing black to play gxh5 then h4. just my opinion. he could have been a bit more patient. and now carlsen must take the h pawn with gxh4. otherwise, he will be worse. the correct recapture. the position is equal. but as you can see, it is slightly easier for humans to play on the white side as black has weaker pawns and white king is a little safer. but still should be a draw unless someone makes a colossal mistake. caruana tries to seal the weak diagonal where his king is hiding in. the position is equal. carlsen will push but it will be a draw. ​carlsen is a very well rounded athlete. he likes to play soccer, basketball, tennis, ping pong, and sometimes even ... chess :) seeing that he gets nothing from the position, carlsen traded rooks to change the dynamics of the game. now he does not have to worry about being mated as the king can always escape the black queen. this gives him time to try to exploit black's weaknesses. more simplification. but carlsen is still slightly better because of the black king safety issue. should be a draw. and if 37... qxa4 38. qc3+ kg8 39. bd5+ kf8 40. qh8+ ke7 41. qxh7+ kf6 completely equal. still should end in a draw. caruana was afraid of some potential complication with 27...qxa4 so he chose the safe way. what carlsen hopes for is for caruana to think this will be an easy piece of cake draw so he becomes careless. what caruana is banking on is even if he has to sacrifice his bishop for the a pawn, he c and h pawn will march, and the white bishop will have to try to defend them and he can simply take the f pawn = draw. now the advantage is back on caruana's side. he will have 2 white games in the final 3. the world championship title is in his own hands!

 the swedish variation has eco code d33. and white carries on with developing. as does black. i thought it was time to take on c5, as he has moved his bishop from f8. in a similar black playing the standard defence to the queens gambit declines waits before white moves his bf1 before exchanging on c4. i also prevent a transposition to the swedish variation. i was interested to see that in fact both 0-0 and bg5 are more popular at this point. so he recaptures. i decided to increase the pressure on the d5 pawn. which he relieves by advancing i attack his bc5 and threaten to take on f6 so he defends. i take he takes back i take again he takes back again i cover the black squares with my queen. he castles so did i and this is the logical square to develop his bishop. now this position has been seen before. i found out later that the gameknot game chessterkh67 (1802) vs. jraul (1706) continued with 15. rac1 and white won in 34. according to the gameknot opening databases, h6 has been played 6 times with 3 white wins, 3 black wins, rfd1 has been played with 1 white win, one black win, and 15. rac1 led to a win for black in ancival lucien (2068) vs. guillaumat jean… (2057). i find another move. see if you can find what i played? this seemed logical to me. boot the knight from c6 by continuing with b5 and then take on d4. what do you think of this move dear reader? is this where i first went wrong? so he delevops his rf8 to a logical square. i carry on with my plan. rather than just lose the d4 pawn, he plays this. i recapture. he hits my bishop. so i take the b7 pawn instead. and he has to move his rook. now, this is the critical position. after the game my opponent criticized my next move, ba6 as it meant my bishop was out of the game. at the time i didn't want to just give up my extra pawn. also although i knew the bishop was a bit out of the action on a6 at least it protects the pawn on b5, and prevents black from contesting the c file with rc8. i would be very interested to know your thoughts dear reader! i would also love to know what decent chess computers would play for white in the position? so i retreat my bishop to a6. naturally bc6 loses a pawn to nxc6 followed by qxc6 and any other retreat just allows rxb5. so, a pawn down, he decides to try and mix it a bit. now if i play exd3 he has rbd8 and he wins the pawn back on d3.  this is an aggressive reply, if knight moves then i can take on d3. maybe it is a mistake as it weakens my king position? he throws in a check i was quite happy with this position. his queen has no checks on the long white diagonal. so to avoid the lose of another pawn he has to exchange now. and i recapture. this move surprised me. i thought he may be aiming for nb4 and exchanging on a6 so i put a stop to that he centralises his knight. i contest the open e file. he wisely gives his king a square. for instance i had been dreaming of variations such as 24....rbd8 25. rxe8 rxe8 26. rd1 nf3 27. qc6 threating qxe8 mate and if 27.....qxc6 28. bxc6 he can't play re2(threatening mate on h2) as i have rd8 mate! now i think this is the losing mistake. perhaps kg2 or qc3 or d3 prevents the combination that follows. what do you think dear reader? this is more or less forced, and i was still quite happy, i thought he was giving up control of the e file. so i recapture. but this is the problem. if my rook advances, he has qg1 mate, or if it moves to any square other than f1 he has qf2 and qxh2 mate, so f1 it has to be. and it attacks the knight, but...... he has this fork, and now black is winning. although a pawn is sometimes enough compensation for being bishop v rook down, this is not one of those positions! so queen moves. knight takes. queen takes back his queen centralises now, normally i wouldn't try and exchange queens when materially down. "exchange pawns not pieces when materially down, exchange pieces not pawns when materially up" is the usual advice. however this is not one of those positions. white is in grave danger of being mated by black's queen and rook, white the queenless endgame is probably just about ok for white. so for those reasons he does not exchange forced! check again! forced again he takes a pawn. i take a pawn. he threatens a mate! i defend he misses a mate in 2! 34....qd5 would have mated. so i struggle on.  and i resigned.

-------------------------------------
1. d4 is an opening i like, because i'm a lover of closed, positional games. 1. e4 on the other hand, guides you (mostly) to open, tactical positions. a waiting ànd developing move ! he prevents me from playing 2. e4, thus i can't occupy the whole center. nevertheless, this wasn't my intention, as said before..  going on with my development, some sort of "london system". mmm, only faced this once before while playing this opening. a very aggressive move !  making space for my light-squared bishop. he's giving a double threat: both on d4 and b2. the best way to keep his queen away from b2. but now, my c-pawn is getting weak.. triple-attacking d4. the pressure is rising !  defending d4 and developing a piece in the same move.  preventing me to play bg5 or be5. and also preparing to play g5 sometime ?  so i play h3, to give my dsb a field to run to, once nh5 or nd5 would be played..  probably his next idea is to play e5; giving more pressure to d4.. also, the diagonal c8-h3 is now open for the lsb. bringing my bishop to his best field. both 7. bd3 nb4 and 7. bc4 d5 would benefit black..  in some way i was trying to get a hold on c4 with my knight. so i would gain some sort of controlled space in the center. gaining space ànd forcing me to retreat with my bishop.  i'd rather like to move this bishop to g3, because i was trying to keep the h-line free for my rook. it's nice to see how the mind of a higher-rated player works.. if i was in stalhandske's place, i would've played something like 9. ... bg6, followed by castling kingside. but my opponent is choosing for a straightforward battle, no time to loose ! interesting !!  both 10. exd4 and 10. nxd4 were going to the same result. this move came as a surprise. my first thought was black would go for a 10. ... nxd4 11. nxd4 qxd4-move, with the win of a pawn. but nevertheless, the pawn can still be taken ! and now, he has pressure with nc3 !  gaining a little bit extra time and space, by attacking black's queen. surely he can come with a check on b4, but since then, i could be leaving my cramped position..  offering a trade of queens. if 12. ... qxd2+ 13. kxd2 and the c3-square would be under my control (but for how long ??). sure, no need to hurry. he leaves the choice to white. but i can't comfortably take on b4: 13. qxb4 ndxb4 and both the c2- and d4-square are attacked twice !  probably not the best move.. but by now, around move 10-20, i'm falling empty regarding new idea's. let's say the middle-game isn't my best phase of the game.  forced moves..  ow yes sir ! maybe i've should've castled earlier, but when ?  16. ke2 nc6xd4+ 17. nxd4 bxd4 and things are getting depressing for white.. with the textmove, the only advantage i'm having is i'm not in check, when black takes on d4.  how further the game is elapsing, the better it is to give the king a more central position ! i wanted to have my rook out of the a1-h8-diagonal, and giving him some things to do in the center, on the semi-open e-file.  expected this move a few moves earlier, buth black has no hurry..  the idea behind this move is to play 21. f3 , and challenge black's dsb by 22. bf2.  and again, the difference between higher- and lower-rated players become obvious.. first, i would've settled my rooks behind some pawns and/or open lines: 20. ... rhe8 and 20. ... rac8 were contenders.  following my first idea..  and with every move, black is gaining a lot of space !  the exchange went as i wanted it to go, but by now, black possesses a whole lot of space of the board !  ok, black is following my move 20-idea, but only after his superior pawn-moves.  making space on d3 for my king, so afterwards my rook could go to c2. i'm down the exchange, but i'm sure he has to fight for a victory !  getting ready to double his rooks on the c-file..  scaring away my knight. the only field of any importance i can go to is a3, offering the rook-exchange.  and again, gaining space !! i guess that's the best lesson to be learned from this game.. it's shown for a dozen times or so. so keep that in mind: "if possible, gain space !!"  so i had to stop him from playing 29. ... b4 (at least for free). if 29. ... b4, then 30. ... rc3+ would follow, with the loss of my b-pawn. again a little surprise.. my 5 cents were going to a d- and e-pawn-march..  so i accept to win a pawn !  but now the whole puzzle is falling on it's place ! he was tempting my knight away from c2, so the rook could get on the back ranks.. nothing i can do to prevent him taking my g-pawn !  this isn't a move of big value, but for the time which was left for me, i was trying to keep at least as much place as i could afford to keep.. by now, my king has a route to get closer to the kingside-pawns. if black had the opportunity to play e6, followed by d5, my king would be stuck on the back ranks. actually, game over.. 33. ... rg3 and 34. ... rxh3 are the next moves..  i've played a little bit further, just to see how my opponent would finish this game..  with this knight-move, my b-pawn is saved for a little while.  unexpectedly !  aha ! that's why my king had to go away ! pawn f3 is dead meat , so is the h-pawn.   thanks stalhandske for this game.. it was a nice way to enter the "walking the walk and learning to run"-club ! 
-------------------------------------
standard opening move for me trying to play into the bdg with 1. d4 nf6 2. f3 d5 3. e4, in more recent games i have played 2. nc3 which i found got me to the position i wanted more frequently  the idea was from this article http://sawyerbdg.blogspot.co.nz/2011/08/blackmar-diemer-gambit-huebsch-after.html i was not sure how to respond to this at the time, initial thoughts were e5 and nc3 both of which would have given me a more familiar position i ended up looking at the gamedb and the options were limited, i hadn't considered bg5 at that point and discounted it because gamedb suggested it was more favourable for black 46%-53%  i ended up playing be3 which seemed more favourable for white, however it cramped my normal position and didnt allow me to play e5 and blocked the a6-f1 diagonal this again was a gamedb move, which suggested it was the best option for white at this stage  i was aware of the rule of not moving a piece more than once in the opening but felt no choice, other options looking at this position could have been nc3 but not really comfortable with the position of the bishops pawn is protected by the bishop on f2 and expecting him to play 5..bxc5 6. bxc5 qa5+ to regain the bishop this seems to put pressure on the c2 square with bxc5 bxc5 and qxc5 trying to get back to development elyhim: 7. bd2 is a bad move. for one you moved the bishop three times. second, 7...e5 will over run you in the centre  i understood what elyhim was saying about moving the bishop 3 times, i was sure he meant bd4 - the logic i feel looking at the position is that i wanted to play bxd4 qxd4 which gave me more control in the centre, i didn't take into account e5 properly  better options could have been e4 which would challenge the centre and after dxe4 fxe4 nxe4 nxe4 i would be able to play nf3 and have some more emphasis on the centre. another obvious option is bxc5 qxc5 e4   essentially the previous bishop move was a waste of tempo for me plus 4th move of the bishop i felt this was probably my best move now expecting dxe4 fxe4 nxe4 nxe4 threatening the queen hmmmfff.. forcing me to move my knight again with options at na4 nb1 ne2, i discounted nd5 na4 threatens the queen but was countered with qb4+ nb1 seemed to be a backwards move with no real benefit  interestingly the post game analysis didnt identify inacuracies or blunders from move 3 to move 17 alsthough the score was -2.25 for elyhim  pga advice on move 3 was best: -0.38 » 3. e4 nc6 4. nh3 bb4+ 5. c3 be7 6. bd3 o-o 7. be3 d6 8. o-o e5 9. na3 bxh3 10. gxh3 qd7 getting the king to safety before an attack at this point i felt like i had created some more space but looking at the position i still had an undeveloped bishop and knight on the queenside with all my moves being defensive, i am expecting him to bring his queenside pieces into play soon looking at the position now it appears a very strong move for black as he asserts more control on the centre with this move, protecting the pawn on e5 and putting pressure on the d4 square in hindsight this almost seems a wasted move, although the material is even i am clearly on the back foot in this position, perhaps bd6 would have been a better move? my logic at the time is that the materiel was even here and to trade queens would relieve some of the pressure, downside is castling would be out of the question if he traded  i was suprised to see this move and was trying to figure out what he was going to do next, perhaps nb4 or b5? took the chance to bring out the bishop and prepare to castle if i can get the knight out oother thoughts at the time were b3 to protect the bishop but didn't play that as it would allow qxc3 threatening nd3 forking the queen, i was reluctant to move the king as i still felt castling was an option i really felt like this was my best option at the time as it defended the d3 square and still didn't move the king  pga gave the following about my innacuracy: inaccuracy: -3.00 » 17. rd1 nd3+ 18. rxd3 rxd3 19. nge2 bd7 20. o-o rd2 21. rb1 bc6 22. qe3 qb6 23. qxb6 axb6 24. bc4 rc8 best: -2.23 » 17. kf1 b6 18. qe3 ba6+ 19. nge2 rad8 20. kf2 bxe2 21. nxe2 rd2 22. rad1 nd3+ 23. kg3 nxb2 24. rxd2 rxd2 considering the previous comment, i was interested to see that elyhim didn't play the nd3 rxd3 rxd3 option? forcing the king back into the firing line.. overall i felt a very weak game by me, i don't think i have played the paleface attack before and certainly am not comfortable with the positions that i got myself into. i think if i had played differently at move 3 the game could have been a stronger one by me, well played elyhim 
-------------------------------------
comments warmly welcomed, of course and thanks to caveman53 for this interresting game. a variation i didn't know. black carries on main benoni line. fiancheto main line it's quite for the moment. still following the main line, developping quietly. surely to prepare e4 and to bring the knight on c4 to menace d6. so white prepares a central attack.  to prevent 11. nb5 and prepare 11. ... b5 preventing 12. kc4 preventing b5 it blocks the lsb but permits ne5or nb3 probably a mistake, weakening the kingside to prevent ng4 which wasn't that dangerous. black lances the attack at the center. the plan is to take control of it. forcing the knight to withdraw but opening the kingside a bit more. black  has to withdraw but the plan is now to attack the g and h pawns. whjte's on attack at the center as well. i do not remember why i did this move which is of very little interest. probably to enable bb7 which has not much interest either. to protect the d pawn without moving the d knight. whit still prepares his attack at the center to unblock my pièces who where totally cramped by white's pawn advance and accentuate the weakness on white's king side. of course the knight would be quycky fired but f6 seemed to me a proper place for the brave lancelot. to protect the b pawn and permit the queen and the d knght to leave their post. mistake, white's kingside is even weaker. the knight has no escape in case of an attack but it doesn't need any, for the brave lancelot is prepared to give his life for his king. so, blood has to flow. ?! if white takes with the queen, he'll be quickly in trouble and have an isolated pawn. taking with the pawn give him 2 pawns advance but a serious weakness on the king side and, most important, it gives me the advantage on the center, so that i'm almost sure to get at least one pawn so that white will have two isolated pawns and black will have the initiative. the bargain seemed ok... but i have been wrong so often that i possibly oversee something. of course, the death of lancelot the brave  charging in the melee with no support will be the price to pay. white opts to take with the pawn. now, black should take control of the center and decimate white's kingside pawns. the weak point of black's plan. menacing 17. qh4+ and black still has 3 pieces protecting e5 which is enough. white's idea is to protect the passed d pawn but the white's king is in a even weaker position. better than 22. ... be5+ as it frees the lsb menacing 23. ... bxg4 or 23. ... nxg4+ so that white is almost forced to take. white takes 23. ... nxe5+ was another candidate move but this seems more offensive because  if 24. ... nxe5, the h2 square is undercontrol of both black queen and  dsb and if 24. ... bg4, the white queen is under direct menace. so that black has more attacking possibilities with this option. forced move (if 24. bh3 rxe5 25. rxe5 bxe5+ 26.kg1 qxh3 with mating menace. there were several options (24.... bg4 24. ... re5 25. ... bd4+) and i'm not sure at all to have chosen the best one. white takes which is almost forced move. now black has regain his lost piece and a bit more since he has the material advantage and positional as well although white's d pawn is dangerous. white counterattacks and his rook protects the queen in cas of 30.re1+ this move seemed to me the winning one but didn't hold all his promises. black is ahead in material and his king is in safer but with the many lower pièces, white can afford trading so that black has to be very carefull, expecially because with his passed pawn black could force an exchange. here, white is fairly cramped : can harly move the knight, lsb is pinned, rook protects the dsb. the only piece white can move safely is the dsb. anyway, the situation is pretty complicated and the first who does the mistake loses. black can quickly be in a very dangerous situation if white manages to set his rook on e8 and his pawn on d7 (black has to take it by rxe8 and is mate by dxe8 with pawn promotion. it's a rather common mating situation. preventing 30. d7 which seemed the most important menace. pretty dangerous situation for black with mating menace, passed pawn on the 6th line and forks attack possibilities from the knight. it seemed the best way to prevent 31. bf6 with fork attack against queen and rook and still keep a control on the h4 d8 diagonal. it has almost the same interest than the last move. if 32. bf6 qc1+ 33. kh2 rxd6 i'm not sure it's the best move (for it leads to the win of the black queen against knight, bishop and the d pawn. may be white should have plaid 33. nd7 to take the b pawn for black could hardly move a piece without being in danger. so, black exchanged a knight vs a queen and white does the same. justice. first, getting some compensation for the queen probably the best move.... black has lost  his material advantage. white proposes a draw and i hesitated. caveman is a stronger player tha i am. as for the situation : material equality, both rooks are on the center on open files. black has 3 pawns on the same color than the white bishop. the black king is near the center and can protect his pawns. gk computer gives white ahead. i wanted to see what could happen and i saw an interesting line. menacing the b pawn and blocking the white king on line 1 but abandoning the b and c pawns to their doom. black's plan is to advance his king and pawn on the left wing to trap the white king and oblige white to exchange his knight and/or rook against a pawn. but it is not a very good move. i didn't play 38. ... f5  to prevent as long as possible white to play re6. but i had oversaw that after f5; the g pawn would have to be protected by the king. i think 38. ... h6 would have been better or even 38. ... f5. 39. re6 kg4. white attacks the unprotected pawn. there i saw that 38. ... h5 was a mistake., for i cannot advance the king without having my g pawn taken. and the plan to trap white's king won't work with isolated pawns. so that i have to advance the f pawn. white's plan is to take on the queen side to have his pawns passed. black has to advance the g pawn and doesn't want to set his king on the h file, for it's better to stay at the center. at last i could push the g pawn but i could have spare at least one move for this result. at least, all my pawns are one or two squares ahead but at the price of one pawn. if 43. rxc5+ kg4 to prevent kg4 it's not a bad place for the king. the most important is to advance. i have to sacrify another pawn but white has to fear a mate in 2 now if the black king comes on g3 white's now one bishop ahead but i still hoped that black's position would compensate it. i offered a draw which white refused. to carry on pushing and to prevent rxh2 i felt quite unsafe for black could now afford to exchange the rooks and have an easy win. and the black rook cannot come on d1 any longer. menacing rb1+ or rxb3 only three more steps and the white pawn is promoted. i decided to force the draw. by menacing perpetual check for if the white's king leaves his corner, black will promote his g pawn in two moves and white needs 3 moves to do the same.  white offers draw and black accepts for if 45. kg2 rb2+ 46. kg1 rb1+ etc... if 45. f3 kxf3  46. rf5+ 47 kg4 rb5.  if 45. rxb3 a6 and the white tower can move move to  protect the pawn. may be there was a way to win but i didn't find it. 
-------------------------------------
so, here we go following the main line to prevent bb5, probably not the best option but an okay move and black's idea is to advane on the queen side. white reinforces his center and prepare to castle. time to prepare castle for black as well so, both kings are safe but the developpement is not yet completed. both rooks on the e file, like often in the benoni. the situation is equilibrated. preventing bg4 (which i surely would have plaid) at this point, i leave the database. the plan was to oblige white to set his knight aside (wether on a4 or b1) so that it wouldn't protect the d5 pawn any longer when e5. would come. to control b3 and d6 and able the lsb or knight to come on d7 that was black's idea when playing 14. nxd5 i was sure that whote would have plaid 15. exd6 rxe1+ 16. qxe1 17. qd7 so that this move completely surprised me. the line choosed by stalhandske is in a way more dangerous for black  because it's more complicated and harder to follow. the d knight has no place to retreat and will soon be attacked by both lsb and queen (if white plays 16. be4, for example). the only solution i found (after long thinking)  was to protect it by both queen and bishop. of course it will enable black to play exd3 as i feared. .protecting the d knight but pining it to the queen and preventing  17. nb3 protecting the c pawn, menacing black's e pawn and joining the rooks. everybody is on the center. the queen still plays the same protecting role and is still pined. annoying but 19. ... rxe6 would have let the d knight with only one protection against two attacking pièces. it had to come to protect the c pawn. material is equal, the black king is less safe because  the f pawn is taken and white has a passed pawn while black has an isolated one. further more black pièces are cramped but after 20 moves, i considred it was not to bad a situation against a player 600 points above me, if i manage to gain some intiative allowing me to get rid of the d pawn. allowing the e rook to menace e3 necessary to avoid 22. rxe6+ rxe6 23. nxd5 pining the rook to the king. i saw no other move and couldn't get he initiative. white carries on attacking but it's the first move for long that black is not under direct menace. this diagonal seemed good to take control of (although white can menace the queen by be2 but it would block his e rook. furthermore, the black queen menaces the a knight if the white queen moves. menacing the weak e pawn protecting the e pawn. protecting the knight and thus allowing the queen to move. also allowing the knight to move on b2 attacking the rook, putting the knight on a less exposed place and controlling d3, thus freeing the f knight or the queen from that job. i couldn't find the reason of this move and against stalhandske it made me feel very uncomfortable. anyway after a big rush on the center until the 18th move, everybody has left it. i prefer open games but i know that it's also the case of my opponent. i longely hesitated before this move because i was afraid to miss something with white's last move and because, for the first time since the begining of the game i had the impression of having several options. the other candidates moves were rd8, 25. ... g5 or 25. ... e5 but 25. ... nd7 seemed safer and wouldn't prevent the other moves further. nd7 has the advantage of controling b3 and thus preventing the white knight on a4 to come there. i had anticipated this move and thought it had the advantage for black to mask the e rook. letting white take the a pawn. but it's a trap. for if 27. nxa6 rxc6 28. nc4 e5 29. rhe4 rxd6. so that black exchanges a pawn not involved in the game against a dangerous passed one and directly menaces the queen, thus getting the initiative. at least that's what i expected but... black's tactic seems to work next step of black's tactic to take d6 there, i was sure to take the d pawn. but... fork attack not much to do to prevent the mate by 30. qg8 (29. ne6 would have let the pawn unprotected). i could have submit at this point but wanted to see how stalhandske would do and how many moves i culd hold against a master. so, i have the impression that i did a good defense until i made a blunder by trying a counterattack overseeing something. 12. ... b4 doesn't seem a good option, anyway. no surprise if it's not in the database.

the best move is supposed to be 8. nbd7 to prevent a further b5 lancelot enters in the battle the brave lancelot stands in the middle of the opposite army dangerous because of bd4+ first getting rid of the annoying lsb. the footman challenges the bishop probably to keep the e and d files free for the heavy pièces. the most logical move. safe move to avoid bg4 perceval must get ready to prepare 15. nh5 the lsb has moved twice, unnecessarily perceval is in ambush for further action.  lancelot is menaced dame guenièvre, worried, comes to support her faithfull knight. which meet his doom. but dame guenièvre revenges her true lover. big mistake. long hesitation, it seemed to be a clue move. i do not like to exchange the dsb in benoni because it's a very powerfull piece and i hoped it was worth it. if 19. nxd4 qxe1+ so that king henry wisely hides lancelot is dead, dame guenièvre won't survive. to take the f pawn. mistake, it doesn't save the f pawn and the e pawn is now unprotected now black can take the e and f pawn. e pawn first now f pawn trading perceval enters in the melee at first sight i found this move strange for the 2 rooks are not joined anylonger and there is not direct menace. in fact there are a bunch of traps for black ; if 25. ...ne2+ 26. kf2 and the knight is doomed. if 25. ... nd5 26. re5 rxe5 27. rxe5 nc7 28. re8. i studied  several other sequences in which black always loses. poor perceval, he won't accomplish anything great this move. menacing b2 and protecting b7, so that the lsb can move easily to defend the center. one more pawn. bringing out the reserve defending the center and the f pawn. to prepare 29. ng5 perceval doesn't like to drawback but the orders are clear : defend the bishop and menace 29. ... bxb3. white could have tried to attack black's king but it seems joanne prefers to defend. now back's plan is to get rid of white's a and b pawns, if necessary by trading but, in this case, without having his own pawns isolated. preventing 29. ... bxb3 attacking one defender of the b pawn. escaping black carries on his plan a common benoni move... usually done earlier in the game, but "better late than never" trading "well done, brave footmen. mission half completed". now, the next task : capture white's b pawn, if possible without damage (for us). now black's plan is to bring the c and d pawn to the second line to oblige white to exchange pieces against pawns. fruitless move joanne is defending very well and despite my material advance, i have a lot of trouble to gain terrain. still defending to prepare 38. ... na6 39. ... ra4 and 40. ... nxb4 white sees the combo abd prevent it. so that i try something else : if 39. rxa4 bxa4 and i have a passed pawn. white again has a proper answer. ?! so that i make another plan. at least, the move will probably surprise my opponent. it considerably weakens black's kingside but i need to eliminate the white knight and play d4 so that perceval can be posted on d5 and it is the price to pay. i suppose that i'll be strong enough on the right center to compensate this drawback. i can bring a rook on  the open e file in case of need. trading the ennoying knight is no more... perceval will be free for new adventures. his horse is impatient. the f pawn is lonesome but well spotted for it controls e4 and g4, 2 important squares... an heroïc footman. the white bishop will probably capture it but it will take 2 moves. menacing the rook if 41. ... rxa1 42. rxa1 menacing 43. ra7 ne6 44. bh5 menacing f7 etc. so that retreat seemed better. of course... finally advancing a pawn sacrifice... ... in exchange of another step. i overlooked this move back to a previous menace : preparing 45. ... nd5 to take the pawn preventing 46. ... nd5 threatening the bishop and enabling the rook to put the white king in check no other  choice mistake but white has little else to do. "now, my brave perceval ! you've been home for a long time, just watching around. it's time you go to battle" "aye aye sir" answers perceval to his king and he goes to d5 from where he can ride whether on b4, directly attacking the white footman or on c3, to menace both rook and bishop or on e3+. the brave knight rides for the decisive charge for which black has sacrificed two poor footmen and his king safety. only move to free the bishop advancing manoeuvers defending d1 only one more step and the little footman will be general but there is still a mighty opponent on the road preparing 51. ... rb1 only move trading "perceval, go for the winning charge !" in case if black makes a mistake perceval the brave menaces the white king wh has to leave the c1 square. 54. ... c1 is unavoidable by white so that joanne submits here.

one of the debates that is currently being discussed in benoni circles is whether or not white should delay playing the f-knight alternative variation: for example ] 6. e4 g6 7. f4 bg7 (7... qe7 8. nf3 bg4)8. bb5+ nbd7 [ we have a hybrid four pawns attack]  if i remember correctly this is what i played against stahandske in our last game(colors reversed) in the benoni game. if you want a deeper review of the in-and-outs of the bf4 variation then may i direct your attention to that game. http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/golden-rules-of-rook-endings?gm=50122. but i am glad he played it as white because it allowed me to demonstrate how i would handle the tricky 8.bf4.   i was intending to play... but forgot about it during the game. alternative variation: 8... a6 [!?] 9. qa4+ bd7 10. qb3 b5 [!?][ to highlight the main drawback of 8.bf4 which is that white can not stop black from developing a strong initiative on the queen side. ]  ? as a general rule white should never allow black to play ...bg4 successfully.  alternative variation: 9. nd2 [!][ the typical move in the bf4 lines. the white knight wants to go to c4. ] 9... ng4 [!?][the main response to nd2. black  takes direct aim at cutting off white's plan of planting a knight on c4. ] 10. be2 ne5 11. o-o f5 [⩲]  alternative variation: 9. h3 [?] 9... re8 10. nd2 nxe4 11. ncxe4 f5 12. be2 fxe4 13. nc4 qf6  alternative variation: [i did not see much gain in] 11... nh5 [!?] 12. bh2 qe7 13. o-o nd7 14. g4 nhf6 [=]  with the idea of bg5  alternative variation: [i did not like ...nh5 due to the fact that white could exchange the dsb's so early in the game. ] 12... nh5 [?!] 13. bg5 f6 14. bh6 bxh6 15. qxh6  i like this move it puts a lot of pressure on black's seriously cramped king side.  alternative variation: 14. qg3 ne5 15. bxe5 dxe5 16. qe3 b5 [∞]  ! pinning black down to the defense of d6.   the knight sits awkwardly on e8 disrupting the communications on black's back rank.   white is trying to push through e4-e5. so black has to get going  ! white threatens in the centre and black punches back on the wing.  blockading the e4 pawn and threatening ...c4  alternative variation: 18. bxe5 bxe5 19. f4 bd4+ 20. kh1 [⩱]  defending the a-pawn and improving the knight position  challenging white for control of the b-file  ! lifting the rook and controlling massive amount of space in the enemy camp.   white goes for broke but he does not have the time and space to do it.  alternative variation: 22. bc2 g5 23. bc1 ng6 [∓]  ! nice tactical shot.   now all of the sudden the black dsb has become a monster and the knight on c3 is a sitting duck!  the white queen and bishop sit haplessly on the other side of the board as the action builds on the queen side.  ? surely to goodness white has a more active move! alternative variation: 27. re1 [!][hoping for...] 27... bd4 [?] ([but...] 27... a4 [!] 28. ra2 a3 29. nd1 rb1 [−⁠+])28. e5 bxc3 29. qxc3 qxg4+ 30. bg3 qd4 31. qxd4 cxd4 32. d6 [⩱][draw]  alternative variation: 29... a3 [is the same as line b after. 27. a4! in note on move 27. ]  0-1 possible continuation

-------------------------------------
the only time i've seen this before was when my opponent attempted sm.  however, people who've surpassed novice status would not do that.  despite knights before bishops, it's a solid move.  but, given that it's 1.e4, e5 themed tourney (with it's starting position, i must think about what to do.)   so, i decide to develop since that's generally the best alternative.  2...d5 came into consideration with an idea of calculating what to do after 3.exd5  the problem is that this would lose a pawn.  and, the idea is not blundering so early. opening up a line for his bc1. not knowing what to do, i take.  the idea being is that if 4.qxd4, i'll hit his queen with 4...nc6. up to my surprise, however, he develops.  so, this had to be a true gambit.  he'll get something better, in return. meanwhile, i continue with my development. this is why he gambit the pawn.  the idea was hitting my n gaining tempo, as compensation, and in return, he'd take my d4 with his nf3. ?! the idea behind this move is to prevent my knight from getting undeveloped on f8.  5...nh5? also came into consideration, except as usual, a knight on the rim is dim.  had i played that, he would've won a piece, after removing his nf3, as it leaves me with a discovered.  so, this appears to be the best move, but according to reversion, it was not.  in it, he said, ..."your 5º move was an inaccuracy already. better was 5...d5, counterattacking my bishop instead. you'll see this is a very common idea in the max-lange attack(1.e4 e5 2.nf3 nc6 3.bc4 nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.o-o bc5). in fact, the positions would be quite similar." as, now that he's reattacked my knight, i must think about what to do here. ?? therefore, i thought i could protect this way and aniticipated his next move, believe it or not.  but, i thought i could answer with 7...qxg5, until the next move, where i saw his bc1 to stop that.   reversion: i think you overlooked the fact that g5 was attacked twice, right? can't see another reason for this move.  jkarp: i definitely overlooked that. i saw it was attacked before, asked myself what i could do to defend. i thought this was the only move, but it still got attacked.  the he explained about what happened after the 5th move by saying, " and for your 6º move, d5 was better once again, giving the pawn back to get castled, in a sharp tactical line running after 7.exd6 e.p o-o 8.dxc7(8.qxe4? re8 pins and wins the queen) qxc7!? 9.qxe4 bb4+ 10.c3 qxc4 11.nbd2(11.cxb4? qxc1+) qb5, and the bishop is immune due to the pin threat of ...re8."   jkarp: they are very similar, when going back to the fifth move. but, after 9.qxe4, i would not play 9...bb4+. instead, i'd pin with 9...re8, right away. i once had a game like this with reuben, saw that i could pin and executed it. similarly, the pin involved the queen.  reversion: e8 is undefended in that line(black's q is on c7), allowing 10.qxe8+.  jkarp: yes, i overlooked that which is quite bad. i remember now, don't know when, but sometime ago, i looked at a similar line. but, i missed that the move played was undefended. consequently, the opponent won a piece. i believe, it was a rook, and shortly after that, the game went downhill.    as i anticipated, reversion takes my weakest pawn.  with that, combined with ta's blitz q sacs (involving the weakest pawn), i asked myself what could be done, in this position.  the reason behind 8.qe7 is that he was threatening to fork my queen and rh8.  by bringing the queen to e7, i thought i'd gotten out of trouble and was gaining confidence.  however, the trouble has just begun, as we're about to see. ?? figuring that i've bailed out, i played this.  it did not appear that he could anything else, until ... this move.  reversion: hm, looks like your queen has been trapped...  jkarp: it has, just when i thought i'd gotten out of trouble.  knowing that my queen was busted, i was doing calculation.  if i didn't take, the queen would be free.  by playing this, i get a piece in return, but as we will see, it's not enough to compensate, anyhow.   meanwhile, he continues developing. and, i have the same idea in mind. bringing his knight to a better outpost, whilst, hitting my bc5. doing whatever possible to stay in, i place him in check. not to my surprise, however, he blocks with his c pawn. ?? so, i try something different, knowing that my position can't be defended.  but, this, however, makes matter worse.  reversion: no, not there! your bishop has been attacked already on c5, so there's no sense putting it back on that same square. probably better is ...dxc3, getting rid of your doubled pawn and leaving me with 2 isolated ones(a2 and c3), then retreating it to e7/f8.  as in our previous game, we should only continue if there's something needful to be learned here. otherwise, just resign this game and move on.  jkarp: in general, i agree. but, i'm planning to annotate it. i won't change the name but will add wtw. they have rules which state that one continues, until mate can be forced. otherwise, i would've resigned after the loss of my queen. it could still work, if i didn't post in that club. but, given that the tourney was from those annotations, it means that i talked the talk which resulted in this game, which they call walking the walk (wtw). with that, i intend to post it in the wtw annotations thread, but resigning now means that they will question it, as this is what happened in one of my games against jack stockel.  this might sound shocking, but i also told everyone, in that thread that i'm playing several simultaneous wtw games, with the very last post.  the mini tournaments is what i was implying.  then, i showed him the link where fred questioned, as otherwise, i would've resigned, right after he took my queen.     so, i played a similar to what we discussed on the 5 and degree marks, by hitting his e5 and bg5. but, that does not bother reversion because of this. so, i intercede by attacking the queen. but, it's of no concern to reversion since he takes. at this point, it appears that i had compensated for some lost material.  but, he pointed out that i did not.  reversion: very well. so might play some cheapo moves to end it quicker   now your rg5 is lost, but it was hard to suggest a good plan anyway...  jkarp: i agree that there are no good moves left. once over, i'm sure that we'll get a lot of comments, and it'll be shown to fred.   still doing whatever possible, i bring my monarch into action.  the idea being that the k is a powerful weapon, in the endgame. but, that does not bother him since i'm in check. the other option was 20...ke8, but my idea is bringing the monarch to h8 because jack stockel has told me that bringing it into the corner is part of king safety. reversion: regarding what you said about your club, you're alluding to a game against jack that were a rook ending where you resigned early, but easy19 said it wasn't that easy for black to win, right?  the difference was that in that game, the material is approx equal, while here my material advantage is evident and you have zero counterplay. that's a basic principle to know when to resign - great material disadvantage with no counterplay at all.  jkarp: that's why. i misinterpreted the difference which often happens to me. yes, there's a big discrepency between that, and what we have now. and, it's true that he said that it wasn't easy for jack to win. that's the example he showed.  i'm going to see what happens when i resign and annotate. hopefully, he won't question it since you do have a forced win. so, i'll keep my fingers crossed.  and, it also turns out that, in this position, reversion has a forced mate, as he told me.  had i continued, he would've advanced the h pawn another square.  if i take, he uses his queen and rh1 for a final attack.  if i don't take, he'll mate by promoting the h pawn.  that's something we reviewed, right after the game.

-------------------------------------
the draw for the first round was done on the usual swizz system. as i was rated 15 out of the 24 players in the tournament, i near the top of the bottom half, and knew i would get one of the best players in the tournament. peter was rated 4th in the tournament - the number 2 seed took a bye in the first round, so i played peter instead of the number 3 seed. as you will see, i was also drawn against the second and thrid seeds in later rounds. this was the first of my three loses in the tournament - all with the black side of the sicilian defence. he heads for the main line. i've recently changed my move order, to avoid 2....nc6 3. bb5 so he plays the open variation. i take. he takes back. the usual move. the usual reply. and i go back to the main line, (sometimes called the classical variation rather than the dragon with g6 or the najdorf variation with a6 or the scheveningen variation with e6. 6. be2 is perfectly playable, if slightly less aggressive than bg5 the richter–rauzer attack or 6.bc4, - the  sozin. i play the boleslavsky variation. this is the older way of handling this for white. nowadays nf3 tends to be played more, as the increased pressure on e5 makes it harder for black to play d6-d5. i develop. he castles. so do i. attacking! if i allow the further advance f4-f5 white can build up a good attack against the black king. so i take. he takes back. i secure a lovely post for my knight. simply moving his king to a safer square and avoiding checks from my queen, if it moves to b6. i continue to develop. i was rather frightened by the prospect of him exchanging on e5 and e6 and leaving me with doubled pawns on those squares. played with the idea of recapturing on e5 with my knight rather than the pawn. i didn't expect his next move, after which i felt a bit uncomfortable. i think 12....ng6 or 12....bc4 are better. with an attack on my d pawn. this move means that my d pawn is now protected by my queen. but he has this. of course, going back to d7 would lose the d pawn. he said afterwards that he was afraid of my bishop going to f6 and enjoying a lovely long diagonal. i take back. he protects the b pawn. i thought i was stopping his knight from entering on b5 or d5, but.... it comes into d5 any way. i take. he takes back. i prevent him from connecting up his queen-side pawns with c2-c4 he connects his rooks. i give more support to my knight on e5. he develops his rook. i attack d5. this is my big mistake! he takes. i take back. i've manged to connect my pawns into 2 groups and prevent his d pawn from being supported by his c pawn. the problem is his d pawn can advance without the aid of his c pawn. he prepared to advance. if only i had another move and could play rd8-d6 i would be ok but..... he advances. i attack the pawn. it advances again. my knight is forced to move again. my knight is rather short of squares! forced! so the pawn goes. i block the d file. find white's next move! would you have played that? it is an excellent exchange sacrifice. i take back. find white's next move! threatening bd5 winning the queen and also 29. bxa8 rxa8 30. d7-d8=queen. so i try this. again, find white's move. usefully driving the king away. find white's next move! he has seen a winning line. i take back. he recaptures the exchange at last. i take back. ok find white's next move. this is the fastest win! black resigns. many thanks for reading, please rate this annotation on the star system, and leave a comment or two to let me know how i am doing with my annotations. until next time dear reader!

having lost with black to a highly rated player from malta in the second round, i rather expected an easier game with white in the next round. well i was drawn with black, and instead of meeting the 4th seed, i was paired against the 5th seed, patrick zerafa (2069), a candidate master with black! i started white's clock. the tournament organisers explained that he had a full-time job in malta, and he would come straight from work. normally the default time is 30 minutes, but i was told that as he had indicated that he would be late, he had an hour to arrive. i waited and waited... but he never showed up, and i was awarded the game by default. then in round 3 i was paired against arne, from germany and at last i was given white. i played the queen's gambit. he plays the albin counter-gambit. although this opening was originally played by cavallotti against salvioli at the milan tournament of 1881, it takes its name from adolf albin, who played it against lasker in new york 1893. though not played frequently at the master level, russian grandmaster alexander morozevich has recently made some successful use of it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albin_countergambit  the recommended reply for white. and the usual move by black.  in exchange for the gambit pawn, black has a central wedge at d4 and gets some chances for an attack. often white will try to return the pawn at an opportune moment to gain a positional advantage. attacking d4. the careless move 4.e3? can lead to the lasker trap. after 4...bb4+ 5.bd2 dxe3 6.bxb4?? is a blunder—6...exf2+ 7.ke2 fxg1=n+! and black wins. the lasker trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion in practical play. and protecting d4 again. 4...c5 allows 5.e3 because black no longer has the bishop check on b4. the usual way to continue, as 5. e3? still, fails to bb4+! turning it into a real gambit, rather than playing ng8-e7 or developing the bc8. so i take. this is unusual and unexpected and caused me to have a long think. i didn't know it at the time, but black has just left any opening database i have access to. recapturing on f6 with either knight or queen has been played before. fritz prefers f6xg7 but that seemed a bit greedy to me. so he takes. i throw in a check. fritz prefers taking on g7 followed by e2-e4 with the threat of a queen check on h5. he takes. i take back. i was rather expecting kxf7 when i can play 10. qb3+ and pick up the b pawn and weaken his queen-side. however.... he counter-attacks my rook. fritz prefers 9....bb4+ so i take. he takes back. what would you play here dear reader? played to stop 0-0-0. fritz prefers 11. qb3 his queen comes back. fritz likes this move. he throws in a check. fritz actually prefers the bishop block. and he is threatening mate, however... i take the knight with check. again, although this seems very natural, fritz prefers the queen check on f7 followed by f2-h4. he has to avoid kd7? 15. bh3+ my queen was attacked. so that his rook can take my knight. i now need to do something about his threat to take on d2 with mate. so i castle, removing the knight from the pin by the bishop, but walking into a pin from the queen. i can always get out of that pin with f2-f4 of course. he decides to stop my knight from becoming active. i take back. and he takes my knight off. i couldn't see any other way of making progress. maybe 18. bh3 was better? his queen drops back. i take off queens. i was looking at 19. qc4 but couldn't see anything concrete, but it may have been better. he takes back. i threaten to win his e pawn. he find the best reply, now threatening to win my e pawn. so i take. i offered a draw here, i could see the next few moves and felt the position to be very level. he throws in a check, forking my king and bishop. my only defence. he takes. i take back. he takes my pawn. i need to activate my king, but kd2 runs into nf3+ winning my h pawn, so i stop that by.... also attacking b7. i was rather expecting simply c6 here, but he is playing for a win so... he plays this. i advance my king. he continues with his queen-side advances. i centralise my king more. he advances again. i start advancing, my king-side majority. his knight drops back- my king advances. he advances again. and so do i. he throws in a knight check. although i was tempted to play kf5, i was concerned at his knight coming into d3, taking on b2 and his pawns becoming a problem. now i expected him to check on e6 again, my king goes back to e4 and it it a draw. however.... he plays this, forking my pawns on f4 and b2. it looks good for him, but i have a strong reply.... this! i am now threatening to take twice on d3 to win a pawn, and reach a won pawn ending. so his knight is rather forced to one of my pawns, but then i take his h7 pawn and my h pawn is really dangerous - an outside passed pawn, just what i need to win this. i think black's position is lost now. he takes this one. i take that one. his problem is that it is hard for him to advance his queen-side pawns quickly, while my king-side pawns are free to move. he tries this. i advance the outside pawn. he advances again. so do i.  his king hurries back to defend. i advance again. so does he. my bishop hurries back to stop his pawn. he takes. i take back. his king comes across to stop my advances. now if he exchanges on c4, he has a lost pawn ending, so... he tries this. but this is very strong. again the pawn ending is lost if he exchanges on d3. this is more or less forced. but now i have two protected passed pawns. his positional is resignable. the bishop's return to c4 is enough to force his resignation. many thanks for reading. please leave a comment or two, award the annotation on the star system, to let me know how i am doing. until next time dear reader!

primera victoria sobre torres. el gambito grunfeld.  la mayoría de partidas que hemos jugado torres y yo se inician con el peón de rey (e4), pero aquí torres inició con el peón de reina... una salida muy común en torneos y que requiere conocer muy bien los primeros pasos de respuesta, que empiezan casi siempre por sacar el caballo de rey a cf6...  ... lo que no se suele hacer es lo que hice yo, sacar el peón de rey desprotegido. pensé que torres se conocía muy bien la otra salida y opté por hacer una salida poco estandar y no recogida en grandes partidas. el blanco se lleva un peón fácil... pero por contra su peón queda muy adelantado y desprotegido. pensé que atacarlo le obligaría a concentrarse en defenderlo y podría desproteger los flancos. sacar la dama a pasear no es lo más recomendado nunca... para él, lo mejor sería sacar la dama a dd5... pero eso va en contra del principio de tener la dama protegida hasta que acabe la apertura. ... la maniobra más lógica es esta, sacar el álfil a defender el peón. un peón de más, 2 piezas desarrolladas por una sola del negro y además éste a sacado la dama, pero... este golpe es importante. recien levantado de la cama, un jaque que amenaza además el álfil de f4 y el peón de b2, con una amenaza velada a la torre de a1. lo más lógico parece salvar el álfil a cambio de perder un peón. de todas maneras la reina negra puede meterse en un atolladero de difícil salida. peón recuperado, amenaza a la torre y amenaza de llevarse el peón de e5 doblemente amenazado. hay 2 opciones para defender la torre. sacar el caballo a cc3 o mover el álfil ac3 y amenazar la dama. parece más agresiva esta jugada, pues obliga a la dama a alejarse del terreno enemigo, pero... el golpe de gracia. el álfil negro en ab4 inmoviliza al álfil blanco. para defender la torre: a) o se saca el caballo, con lo que se pierde un álfil 7. cc3 dxc3 b) se puede desbloquear el álfil tapando con el caballo de f3 -> 7. cfd2 axc3, con lo que se acaba perdiendo también 1 pieza c) se saca la dama a d2, con lo cual todas las piezas quedan defendidas.  c) parece la mejor opción y es la que torres tomó, pero... ahora si come con el caballo, pierde la torre y otro peón, el de a2. y si come con la dama es jaquemate...  ... a torres no le debió gustar la situación en la que quedaba, así que se rindió.  victoria relámpago, blitzkrieg!

in this game my opponent gets an advantage, but i fight back and manage to draw, a rather lucky draw! it was played on chess.com my first game from that site to be annotated, and i will use the assessments from that site. sicilian defence main line what i usually play now. open variation i take he takes back. i attack the e pawn he defends i opt for the main line. the richter–rauzer attack for the time being i prevent the doubling of my pawns. vsevolod rauzer introduced the plan of qd2 and 0-0-0 in the 1930s. preventing a piece from getting to b5 and also preparing b7-b5 castles of course the nc6 needs protecting before b7-b5 can be played. he will match my queen side expansion with advances on the king side and/or the centre. the advance comes he takes. this looks strange, but taking with the queen is bad. qxf6 11. e5! dxe5 12. ndxb5! with massive advantage to white. the king tucks himself away near the and avoids any tactics on the c1-h6 diagonal and makes attacks along the c file less likely. threatening exchanges on d4. black's king is far less secure than the white queen and an exchange of queens makes a successful attack on the black king less likely. white exchanges black takes back and the attack continues. the black queen aims for e5. my opponent afterwards said that he wondered if this move was sound - whether black had time for this? however it is the most commonly played move here, and i pointed out that white has to sacrifice a pawn to prevent the queen occupying the e5 square with the queen. he takes. this looks a bit strange too, voluntarily undoubling black's f pawns, but it does loosen black's king position. black takes back. and the bishop finally comes out with a plan of developing my bf8 to h6, but it doesn't turn out too good. i wonder if 15. ....qe5 was better to prevent what happens next. this is considered a star move by chess.com taking this way strengthens the centre "always take towards the centre" part of the idea is this - it is a clearance sacrifice for the knight. so i take. he takes back. the usual square that the ra1 goes to in this variation. taking control of the open file. finally developing my bishop. a star move, attacking a6 this was the only way i could see of protecting a6, but as it turns out i can't protect it anyway. d6-d5 was better. another star move, attacking b5. again, i thought this was the only way to protect b5, but as we shall see, this doesn't really protect it. d6-d5 was better. oops! i can't take back with the rook as there is a bishop fork on c6 and i can't take back with the pawn on a6 as the pawn is pinned against the queen. at last! white throws in a check, it looks very natural, but in fact this move is not the best, simply retreating the bishop to d3 was better. i was quite pleased when i saw this move as, at the right moment, i may be able to play e5-e4 cutting off the bg6 from play on the queen side. forced! the only square the king can move to. another star move, according to chess.com, threatening nasty discovered checks with the b5 pawn. so getting out of the way of the queen's diagonal. rook comes in threatening the bishop. while a few moves ago i was really worried, i was now thinking i was doing ok. i didn't think this worked. i wasn't 100% sure that i was ok, but recapturing is virtually forced. he takes the pawn with check. king drops back. he had a long think and eventually came up with the move chess.com gives as the star move. with the threat of rf7 winning the queen. virtually forced, another star move. he takes. i take back. i later set up this position on fritz and at first it thought b6+ was winning here, but then saw the defence - 30.	b6+	kc6 31.	b7+	kc7 32.	qa8	qb8 and black is ok, and then it saw 32. qa7! and white wins. chess.com gives this a double question mark.  and black offered a draw, which white accepted. computer analysis does show that the position is level now, but there is play left in this position. many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two and rank the annotation with the star system to let me know how i am doing, until next time dear reader!

signs of the struggle to come. my opponent is a steadfast partisan of the dutch and never misses an opportunity to defend its honor; for my part, the dutch is one of my absolute favorite openings to play *against*. the veresov dutch – while 2. nc3 generally leads to a quiet game against most black set-ups, against dutch it is a sharp and ambitious line. white intends to play e4, with a sort of mirror-universe sicilian position. black has the option of preventing this with …d5, but that has its own dangers, as we will see. my opponent knew very well that i like to play this line against the dutch, having suffered against it several times, and so he came prepared this time… to make way for e4. this is black's last chance to definitively rule out e4. in doing so, however, he commits himself to weakening the light squares in his position, locking in the light-squared bishop, and allowing doubled f-pawns. the alternative …e6 allows white to take over the center right away. the famous game ed. lasker vs. g. a. thomas is an excellent example of the dangers black faces in this type of game: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1259009 let's take stock of the position: black has complete control over the e4 square as well as the bishop pair. at the same time, white is ahead in development and has the f-pawns as a target. black's bishop pair is unlikely to be of much use in this closed position, but on the other hand white has blocked the c-pawn and so the usual c4 pawn break will be harder to organize than usual. white's plan, at its simplest, is to play bd3, qf3, and nge2 to pressure the f-pawns, and then to further weaken them with either h3-g4 or h4-h5. this plan does not pan out so well in this game, so an example of how powerful it can be seems in order: browne vs r. byrne, 1977 (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1333279) was the game that first persuaded me to give this variation a try. !? an interesting deviation from the more usual …c6. there is only one other instance of this move in the db, but it makes sense – quick development and queenside castling. black will support the center with piece play (…ne7) and keep a more fluid pawn structure. in this game it worked out well for black, as i had trouble adjusting to the changed circumstances. continuing to pressure the pawns. ?! i really liked this move at the time, since it prevents …nb4 in order to preserve my bishop and (i thought) deprive the knight of any future. as the knight is headed to e7 anyway, the latter point is simply not true. as for the former, i am not sure that there is anything wrong with allowing …nb4 and …nxd3. the bishop ends up being pretty pathetic for most of the game (especially in contrast to black's knight), and after 8. nge2 nb4 9. 0-0 nxd3 10. cxd3 i have an open c-file, a possible minority attack with b4-b5 if black plays …c6, knights against bishops is a closed position, and support for a potential e4 push. black would be better off continuing 8. …ne7 as in the game. in short, with 8. a3 i weaken my queenside to prevent a move that black probably didn't want to make, anyway.  i thought for a long time about how to open up black's kingside. the h4-h5 plan has little force, since black just replies …g5 and castles queenside. 10. g4 fxg4 11. qxf6 was tempting, but of course black does not need to take on g4 can just play …bg7. this move was intended to increase the pressure on black's light squares with the hope of making g4 possible.  ! as bad as the bishop looks, it is needed here to keep everything together. black plays with restraint, looking to push the white forces back later. again trying for g4. this is a bit of wishful thinking that should have gotten me into trouble. in reality, the kingside will soon belong to black, and white should have looked to the queenside for play with h4 (to discourage …g5), qe2, nd1, rc1 and c4. ! white's forces have stayed too long on the kingside and black's pawn roller will force them back in disarray. this move prepares …g5 (if 11. …g5 right away, then 12. nh5) as well as …h5, clamping down on the white kingside. ?! at this point i realized that i was in real trouble on the kingside, and decided to at least get my king out of the way asap. white's problem is one of dynamics: although white appears to have the better pawn structure, black's pawns are in fact more dangerous for one simple reason: they can move. black's pieces, seemingly huddled in confusion on the last two ranks, are in fact well placed behind the pawns to support their advance. white's pieces, meanwhile, however far advanced they may seem, actually block white's own pawns – particularly, the nc3 inhibits the vital pawn break c4.  0-0-0 does nothing to solve these problems – in fact, it simply gets in the way of the queen's escape route and causes a traffic jam for the retreating white pieces. moreover, the king's position on c1 makes it even harder to get c4 in.  much better would have been qd1, intending to leave the king in the center, retreat the f-knight to e2, and get on with organizing c4 and queenside play. ?! black takes a move out to tuck away his king. still, 12. …g5 13. ne2 h5!, threatening to trap the queen and forcing ng1, would have been more direct, and black could have already claimed an obvious advantage. ?! stupid. i am still laboring under the mistaken assumption that i should be playing on the kingside. white needs to resolve a major tactical problem: the queen and the knight both need to retreat via e2, or else one of them risks being trapped. re2, g3, ne2-g1, and even h4 would have all been unpleasant, but they would have addressed this vital problem. even better would be bb5!, allowing the knight into d3, which i played (too late) next move. ! locks down the kingside, and contains some tactical threats as well. i am now forced to conclude that i won't be getting any play on the kingside after all. ? good idea, bad timing.  my plan is to get the bishop off d3 with tempo, provoking a weakness in black's castled position at the same time. unfortunately, right now i don't have time for this and have to respond to the veiled tactical threat of …g5 and …bh5 with 14. g3. ? black underestimates his position. instead, 15. …g5! 16. ne2 (nd3?? bh5 17. g4 hxg3 ep 18. qxg3 bxd1 +-) …bh5 17. g4 hxg3 ep 18. qxg3 looks excellent for black.  now white has a chance to untangle on the kingside. ! the knight's job is done, and it recirculates to the queenside. i should say that at this point my opponent lost by timeout, so i reinstated the game (seeing that he was winning and all, and hardly deserved to lose just like that), letting him know that he had missed …g5! at this point, i think he tried to hard to make something of the lost combination, rather than continuing with the sensible regrouping started by …nc8.  finally preparing to make some queenside play. ?! i think this is a waste of time, now that white can interpose with f3.  i was very concerned about the simple plan of playing …nb6 and …nc4, which would basically shut down my queenside play before it started. this move came as a big relief to me: the fact that black would move his bishop off of f7, where it supports …nc4 so well, meant that he probably hadn't seen that plan. my opponent probably meant to make something of the half-open e-file once i unsupport the e-pawn with f3, but as we see in the game, that doesn't work too well for him. ? now this is a serious mistake. black has been outplaying white for most of this game so far and, though he has missed some chances, he would still have a real advantage after 19. …nb6/d6 20. bb3 nc4, where white has no play and black can search for a breakthrough at his leisure. there is no good way to get control of c4 back – if bxc4 dxc4 the pawn becomes almost as annoying as the knight (and invincible after …bf7), while the pawn on a3 (dammit, 8. a3!!!!!!!) drops with check in case of b3 or b4.  after 20. …nc4, i had actually planned to play 21. b3 nxa3+ 22. ka2 as a pawn sacrifice, choosing to go down in complications instead of being slowly crushed.  one of black's biggest problems in this game is under-appreciating the strengths of his position. it's easy to miss chances for advantage if you assume they aren't there!  ? a lazy move. i had some hazy idea of playing b4, rb1 and nc4, but to be honest i just didn't want to go to the trouble of figuring out a plan and hoped my opponent would hand me something to use. not a good frame of mind to be in!  i'd say that this temptation to drift without a plan is white's biggest problem throughout this game, and an important lesson for me to learn. a creative way to activate the rook, but doubling on the e-file is not as useful as it seems - the e-pawn is easy to defend for now, and black would be better served by nd6-c4. anticipating ...rhe7, which was indicated by black's last. i noted that b4 would then no longer be covered, and i wanted to be ready to take full advantage. ? ...bd6 should have come first, maintaining a guard on b4. (yes, ...bxb4 would give up the bishop pair, but in this closed position the knights are clearly more useful, especially when they hit at a6 and c6.) ! taking advantage of the temporary obstruction of black's dsb to gain a lot of activity very quickly. or  ...rd6 24. na6+ (24. n[either]xd5? b5!) kb7 25. qd3, and the knight will be a bone in black's throat, though at least it can't get to c5.  the king now takes up residence in the corner for the rest of the game. i looked at nxb5!? cxb5 26. bxb5, getting a rook and two pawns for two pieces (...qxb5?? 27. nc7+) i also looked at variations where after 26. ...q[somewhere] i didn't take the rook, though i could find nothing concrete, and at 25. bxb5 cxb5 26. nxb5, which seemed inferior. 25. nc5 is tempting but ultimately after ...qc7 26. bb3 ra7 27. nd3, (na6?! qb7 28. nb4 bxb4 =/+) which seems =, possibly +/=, i have reduced my own tactical possibilities, though this line was perfectly playable.   as far as i can tell, 25. nxb5!? should give white a better position, but it is a complicated position where i had trouble finding a plan and so i chickened out. perhaps other players with time (or an engine) on their hands would care to add their own analysis? -- especially my opponent, of course.  no c5 for you! ? at this point i was excited to discover the line 26. nxd5!! cxd5 27. bxd5+ qxd5 28. nc7+, which seemed to win by force... except, of course, that 27. ...qxd5 comes with check, and therefore nc7+ is quite illegal. cursing my 20. ka3, which turned nxd5 from !! to ??, i then completely refused to learn the obvious lesson about making pointless king moves and proceeded to "fix" my mistake by making it all over again.  instead of vainly hoping that i'd get the chance to play 27. nxd5, i should have made the best of my king's position to begin play on the a-file with a4, ra1 and only then kb1 if necessary.  ! now my opponent find the nb6-c4 plan, ruining my swindle at the same time. as noted before, this move -- which is now necessary to create play -- has much more force with the king off the back rank. ...dxc5?! 29. axb5 cxb5 30. d5! and white has a big initiative. !? i will control b4! again, striving for active play at all times. more passive play, such as 29. nc5?! bxc5 30. dxc5 would soon leave the game totally under black's control. black has a strong pawn roller on the center and queenside, if it can just get moving. ? right idea, bad timing. ...qb7 30. n[either]b4 bxb4 31. nxb4 and now white's attacking chances are much reduced. black does not have to allow white such dynamic possibilities as in the game. with a little patience, he could have slowly forced the white pieces back and then played ...f5 at his leisure. this is not the same as defensive or passive play because it actively and aggressively limits white's play so as to add strength to one's own attack.  ! sacrificing a pawn for the initiative to counter black's (otherwise irresistible) attack. threatening nc7+. 31. d5 would have transposed. or ...bd6 32. d5 re5  (...cxd5? 33. qxd5+ qb7 34. qxc4 and now the threat is rxd6 and nc7+ so either ...bb8 35. nc5 +-, or ...bc8 35. qxe6! rxe6 36. rd8+ qb8 37. rxb8#, or else ...qd7 35. nc5.) (...r6d7 33. dxc6 qxc6 34. nab4 seems promising for white, though black is not yet lost.) 33. nab4 and black seems to be holding and posing threats of his own, though white still has a promising position. ! the center breaks wide open and chaos breaks loose! !? i had analyzed ...cxd5, exf3 and e3 all as winning for white. i had not even considered this move, to my opponent's credit!  black now puts up a tenacious defense but unfortunately the position is already very dangerous. 32. ...cxd5 33. rxd5 qc8 (or else nc7+) 34. red1 and the threat of rd8 is decisive. 32. ...exf3 33. dxc6 qc8 34. rxe7 rxe7 35. c7  32. ...e3 33. cxd5 qc8 (qxc6 34. rd8+ kb7 35. n2b4) 34. c7 ! preserving the initiative. again, an unexpected move. other moves are no good: 33. ...cxd5 34. qc6+ rb7 35. rxd5 and white will start collecting all of black's pawns. 33. ...re5?? 34. qc6# 33. ...qd7 34. dxc6 black's counterplay is just a step too late. awkward but forced: 35. ...bxe7 36. d6 bd8 37. d7 more practical chances would be offered by counterattack with ...fxg2. then 37. qd5!, (threatening c7#) rc7 (...re5 qxg2 is no help) 38. nxc7+ qxc7 39. qd8+ wins.  black has managed to organize some defense, but has become totally passive in the process, so that white can finish things off at his leisure. after ...fxg2 38. c7! threatening both qc6# and rd8. there is fianlly time to bring up reinforcements and make luft (at a2) at once. black is hogtied. just about all the possibilities run into mating nets: ...fxg2 qd5; ...bf7 c7 ->rd8, qc6+, etc. black allows a quick and pretty finish. ! yes, rd8 wins as well, but the exclam is for style. ...qxc7 40. rd8+ qxd8 41. qb7# is so much nicer.  an interesting beginning, a muddled middlegame and a stirring finale. 
-------------------------------------
a solid approach from black – i knew that my opponent was most comfortable in attacking positions so i stayed away from the more provocative lines of the sicillian such as the schevenningen or dragon. the taimanov sicilian, one of the most solid sicilian variations. i'm not sure this is the most challenging move at white's disposal. developing with, say, qe2 or qe1-h4 is probably more relevant to the struggle for the center. still, white will have to make this move eventually, so it is safe, at least. ?! striking out for freedom, but a bit premature. …b5 and …bb7 is more solid. ? closing lines and weakening the center. this should not have worked out as well for white as it did in the game. there is no longer any hope of clearing the way for the bd3 or the rf1. white should embrace the tension in the center, since he is trying to open lines for his developed pieces. 12. f5 not only closes lines, it also hands the center over to black, since without the f-pawn exerting pressure on black's e-pawn, there is nothing to hold back the freeing advance …d5.  instead, nd5! nxd5 13. exd5 bxd2 14. qxd2 (bxh7+?!? kxh7 15. ng5+ is tempting, but after …kg6! white has nothing better than qxd2.) gives white a strong initiative. ! giving up the bishop pair but paving the way for the thematic sicilian break …d5, after which black's active pieces will more than compensate for it. if black does not play this move, then why did he play …e5? ! the proud white center falls very quickly. black can now claim full equality, at least. perhaps …re8 right away is more accurate. i was indulging in a pipe dream of …nb4, nxd3, and bxf5, which was not going to happen. a good spot for the queen, eyeing both kingside and queenside, controlling b4, and avoiding the knight fork awaiting her on e2. ?! this is one way to prevent …e4, but the knight would be a better blockader after ng5-e4. (ng5 e4 18. nxe4 just loses a pawn, since white has enough time to play qh4 and safely break the pin.) ?! again, rd1 was called for. there is no pressing need for c3, since c2, d4 and b4 are adequately covered. even if the f3 knight moved and black did manage to get a knight on d5, white could then play c3 with tempo and drive it away. ! putting the question to the knight while black has still not completed development. (i would usually have no problem with doubled pawns in return for a bishop-for-knight trade, but here it would leave my king far too exposed.) notice that neither white nor black have been terribly concerned about the possibility of nxe4 so far, since as long as there's a pawn on f5, that bishop is a non-factor. with the pawn's blockader about to go, however, the bishop must be eliminated. ? a natural move that gets black into big trouble. …f6! was necessary and good, after which black would have a very comfortable game. i actually considered playing it, but underestimated white's threats and felt more comfortable breaking the pin on the h1-a8 diagonal. this oversight very well could have lost me the game! ! white immediately takes the initiative. now the threats come very fast, and there is no time for …f6 thanks to the pin on the g-file. the opportunity for ...f6 is over, thanks to the pin on the g-file. darn!  white threatens bf6, bh6 and f6, and i could find nothing better than to play this move, breaking the pin and allowing ...rg8 if necessary. ! of course, white rules out ...f6 right away, while forcing a disruption in the black king's pawn shield. what else? ...rg8 23 fxg7+ rxg7 24 bf6 is no good, and so i am obliged to create holes around my king. ! again, white mixes attack with prophylaxis. this phase of the attack is very instructive because of how black simultaneously snuffs out black's defensive resources while increasing his own threats. here, i had hoped to get in the liberating move ...h5, which would greatly slow down the white attack and give me time for counterplay. instead, white blockades the h-pawn and hones in on g7. the one downside is that the queen's route to h7, h6 and/or g7 is temporarily blocked. !? what to do? white not only has a big attack, but has also prevented any immediately useful defensive move that black might want to play. it might seem odd for me to "force" the white knight to g5, where it already wanted to go anyways, but this move is motivated by sound practical logic: black is not going to be able to defend against white's attack -- my pieces on the queenside are just not going to get there in time. my only hope for survival, then, depends on getting some kind of counterattack going. pushing the pawn does three things to help that: 1) it clears the h2-b8 diagonal for the queen while giving the e-rook more scope on the e-file; 2) it controls the f3-square while opening e5 for the knight; and 3) it disrupts the timing of white's attack. white would prefer to play qh4 first and ng5 second, which retains control of e5 for a turn longer, but now he doesn't have that choice. !? again, forcing a move that white planned to play anyways. now, however, black's formerly pent-up pieces are starting to take up active posts in the center. white needs to be careful not to underestimate this activity. (as they say: "the best way to meet an attack on the flank is with an attack in the center.")  ! white threatened bg7+ kg8 26. qxh7#. now, bg7 can be met with ...h5, and white's attack has stalled. still, white's pieces seem extremely threatening, and the situation is optically very grim for black. for one thing, nxh7 looks very strong. the black position contains hidden resources which are easy to underestimate, however, and the game is far from over. my opponent, thinking i was on the ropes, probably expected a resignation soon after his next move… ? this seemingly crushing move actually loses for white! how? ...kxh7 26. bg7+ kg8 27. qh8# seems pretty convincing... but black doesn't have to take the knight! this counter-sacrifice neutralizes white's attack completely. the attacking white pieces which seemed so  menacing a few moves ago now trip over each other clumsily -- the f-pawn blocks f6 from the knight, while the knight and bishop temporarily block the h-file for the white queen as effectively as if they were black pawns. after this move, black poses a series of powerful threats which do not allow white the time to rearrange his pieces and continue the attack. by repeatedly activating my pieces while forcing white into reactive mode, i am able to completely shift the initiative to black.    it seems clear that white did not have the option of moving the knight away from the defense of f3 last move, and so developing with re1 seems best, with the dangerous plan of re1-e3-h3, for example, which is hard for black to meet. white needed to continue the slow buildup of an attack by mixing threats with prophylaxis as seen before. still, while it seems clear in hindsight that 26. nxh7 is a mistake, it is hard to criticize a move that wins convincingly in all variations except for one improbable sacrifice. white was understandably eager to cash in on the strong attacking position he had built up with patience and care, and in his position i would have hardly expected the tables to turn so quickly, either. ? instead of accepting the sacrifice, white could have gone for the endgame after qh3 qxh2+ 28. qxh2 nxh2 29. kxh2 kxh7, where black may have a slight edge due to better-placed rooks and the vulnerability of the f-pawn, but white has good chances for equality. though objectively speaking qh3 gives good chances to hold while the text move loses outright, i cannot blame my opponent for continuing to play for a win in a position which had seemed so overwhelmingly better just a move ago. the knight sacrifice seemed desperate even to me, and i doubt that many players of our level would have seriously considered declining it. the first surprise threat: ...f2+ is mate in two. qf2 is met simply by ...kxh7, where material is even and black has an overwhelming position. after kg1, black has a number of good options. one simple path to advantage is ...qc5+ 29 qf2/d4, (rf2 re4 as in the game, except that white has self-pinned) and after the trade of queens and ...kxh7 we again come to a much better ending for black. i would not be surprised, however, if black could try for even more by keeping the queens on with 28...re4. threat number 2, dislodging the queen while clearing space for the a-rook. ?! it would be more challenging to play qh3, after which black still has the same crushing attack as in the game, but at least white has some material to show for it in case black messes up. now i can win back my piece without disrupting my attack in any real way. ! threat number 3. even if black wasn't threatening mate on e1, the knight still has nowhere to go and black is in no hurry to round it up. in the last three moves, black has been able to activate every piece for the attack, while white's position has not improved in any real way and the white pieces are no longer well placed for attack or defense. i was even startled by how fast things had turned around, let alone my shocked opponent! recovering the piece with yet another gain of time. (threat number 4?) !? a bit of prophylaxis mixed with increased pressure on the f-rook. ...re2 is the obvious move, and as far as i can tell it is completely sufficient to win, but after qg3! white would all of a sudden be threatening a lot of cheap tricks on the h-file and g7 square. there are several lines where white can just sac the f-rook and mate my king. while black should be able to avoid that fate with careful play, i figured that this game had already seen enough surprise twists and i wanted to carefully exclude any possibility of a white counterattack before going in for the kill. again, with the the idea of a future mating attack based on qh3+. white is (admirably) not ready to give up while there are still swindling chances. against qh3+. ...kg8 would be just as good, but i liked having the option of taking control of the h-file myself with rh5. the obvious ...re2 is not losing, but after 33 qh3+ qh5 or 33 qh3+ kg8 34 qh6 qf8 white can lessen the force of black's attack somewhat by trading queens. avoiding exchanges in this position allows a quick win due to black's overwhelming piece activity. at last! this move is even more powerful after being delayed for two turns. my opponent resigned here, as there is no answer to both …rxd2 (followed by ...rg5 if necessary) and, if the bishop moves, …re8+, mating.  i found this in incredibly instructive game for both of us – a lesson on how much patience and care is necessary to conduct a successful attack against an alert opponent, and most importantly a reminder that even some of the most desperate-looking positions hide a whole mess of incredible hidden resources. it ain't over 'til it's over!

다시 생각해보니 별로 좋은 수가 아닌 것 같다. 비슷한 수준의 상대에게 생각없이 밀어붙이는건 좋은 행동이 아니다. white는 knight 하나를 희생시켜 black의 킹을 위험한 곳으로 유인한다. 이 수는 전혀 생각하지 못했기 때문에 당황스러웠다. white의 queen은 black의 king과 knight를 동시에 공격한다. (fork) 여기서 white는 qxf6를 취하지만 좋은 수가 아니다.  내가 생각하는 최선의 수는 8. bxc6  bxc6  9. qxc6 다. 이렇게 게임이 진행되면 white는 추가적인 이득을 얻을 수 있고 black은 진형을 추스르기 전에 king 반대편 진형이 초토화되는 것을 막는데 전력을 쏟아야 한다. 내심 bishop끼리 자폭하길 바랬지만 내 진형이 더 나빠지는 쪽으로 white는 교활하게 움직였다. 기물은 white가 하나 앞서 있다. black의 pawn structure와 king의 위치도 엉망이다.  하지만 white는 중앙 쪽으로 전혀 기물이 배치되지 않은 반면, black은 pawn과 bishop이 중앙을 어느정도 장악하고 있다. 게임 당시에는 절망적으로 느껴졌지만 생각보다 내가 할만한 국면이었던 것 같다. white은 체스에서 초반에 여러 기물을 움직여 중앙을 장악하는 것이 얼마나 중요한지 잘 모르는 것 같다. black은 white의 약점을 조금씩 찌르며 4-5 라인의 점유율을 높이고 있다. white의 실수다. g2의 약점 때문에 black이 pawn 하나의 이득을 보게 된다. 내가 유리한 상황이기 때문에 시간을 많이 써서 이득을 취할 방법을 생각했다.  1. checkmate가 가능한가? -> 힘들 것 같다. 2. 그러면 이 상황을 이용해서 rook을 하나 없애보자.  여기까지는 강제된 이동이다. white로서는 rook과 bishop의 교환을 허용할 수 밖에 없었다. 상대의 남은 두 개의 주요 기물을 묶어둘려는 의도였다. 치명적인 실수다. black은 두 수에 checkmate가 가능하다. 실수가 있어도 꿋꿋하게 두면 승산이 있다는 교훈을 주는 한 판이었다.
