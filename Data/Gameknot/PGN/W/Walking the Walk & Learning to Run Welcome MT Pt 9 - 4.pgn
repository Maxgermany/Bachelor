1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ng5 h6 6. Nxf7 {All game start here in this mini tournament.} Kxf7 {Easy19 played Qf6 against me instead of Kxf7, but I don't have the guts (or the skill) to let him swipe my rook.} 7. Qxg4 Qf6 {I play it now, to try to give my king a little defense. In my game against vandoostlo I moved my knight there instead, and died horribly an painfully even faster than against easy19. (11 moves)} 8. Bc4+ d5 {I don't see anything wrong with this move, because if he captures my LSB (as he does) get his and reduce some of the attack. Of course, he can start raiding my pawns but I didn't see anything better than this.} 9. Qxc8 dxc4 10. Qxb7 Qc6 {This protects my rook.} 11. Qc8 Qxe4+ {I start some pawn-grabbing of my own.} 12. Kd1 Qxg2 13. Qf5+ Ke8 14. Re1+ Be7 {While I am ahead in material, I don't really like my position.} 15. Nc3 Nc6 16. Nd5 Qf3+ {After he added the knight's pressure to the bishop, I decided to force a draw. The reason there are more moves than necessary, is because I plugged them in as conditionals and didn't bother to count how many times I did it.} 17. Re2 Qf1+ 18. Re1 Qf3+ 19. Re2 Qf1+ 20. Re1 Qf3+ 21. Re2 Qf1+ 22. Re1 Qf3+ 23. Re2 {And.........Draw! I was ahead, but I just didn't like my position, and he did have a higher rating than me, so I'm pretty glad I survived with the black pieces, until now I've had better luck with the white.}
