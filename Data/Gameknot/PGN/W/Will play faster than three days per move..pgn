[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A50)"]

1. d4 {Playing as white. Queens pawn.} Nf6 2. c4 a6 {? Dubious in my opinion. Neither attacks the center or flanks. Defends against the bishop pin on the knight. } 3. Nc3 {Developing the knight. } e6 {Free's up the diagonal for the bishop. } 4. Nf3 {Developing. } d5 {Attacks the pawn. } 5. Bf4 {Developing, I allow him to take the pawn knowing that most likely he won't be able to keep it and I might have a development edge. } h6 {Again non developing move. Perhaps weakens king side slightly. } 6. e3 {Free's the white bishop and defends the c4 pawn. } g6 {Probably clearing the way for the black bishop to franchetto (sp?) White is further developed. } 7. Bd3 {Here I'm looking at a bishop queen battery because I think he's going to castle king side. } Bg7 {Clears way for the king side castle. } 8. O-O {I castle. I am an amateur and want to get my king out of the way. } Nc6 {Developing. } 9. Qc2 {Forms battery on the b1-h7 diagonal, links the rooks in the back rank. I might be looking at a bishop sacrifice down the road to clear the defenders. I miss the intruding Nb4 when analyzing but I see the answer to the problem when the move comes. } Nb4 10. Qa4+ {Queen check avoids the loss of a pawn on c4 and attacks the knight. } Nc6 {Removes the check and defends the knight. Pins knight to king. } 11. Ne5 {This might be preemptive. My idea is to put pressure on the center and king side while keeping him busy. } Bd7 {prevents losing a pawn. Possible discovered attack on my queen and knight, I want to avoid this. } 12. Nxc6 {Simplifying and removing the discovery. I plan to reform the battery for my bishop. } Bxc6 {Attacks queen. } 13. Qc2 {Moves to safety and reforms battery. } O-O {Castles. } 14. Be5 {Pins knight to bishop. Idea here is that if the knight moves I can take his strong bishop with my weak one. His king side would also be weakened. } Rb8 {Not sure what his idea is here. Perhaps he is hoping to play b5 and maybe bring his rook into the game. } 15. f3 {Not the best. My idea was probably to keep my battery intact. It prevents Ne4 but weakens king side. } dxc4 {Threatens bishop. } 16. Bxc4 {Move it to safety and takes blacks pawn. } Bd5 {He is threatening my good bishop with his bad bishop. I don't want this trade. } 17. Bd3 {reforming the battery. Note that both of my bishops are active and my queen is more active.} b5 {Probably trying to push his pawn to influence a trade of knight for bishop. I don't want to trade down here because I think I have the positional edge. } 18. Ne2 {I moved my knight back threatening black with a fork. I plan on moving my knight to f4. There is a number of ways he can defend. He's probably going to defend with his queen hoping to preserve his rook lift to attack my queen and temporarily gain the c file. I'll probably first attack his bishop then move my rook on a1 to c1 continuing the attack on c7. }
