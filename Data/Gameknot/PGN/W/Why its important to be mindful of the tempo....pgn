1. e4 {I haven't done much annotation lately so i thought this would be a good match to annotate since this time I'm black. I'm trying to learn a bit more theory on openings and middle games, but to be honest, everyone is bound to develop their own strategies. So, hope you enjoy!} c5 {Ok, one thing i know is that this opening move 1.. c5 is supposed to unbalance the game, which is true. White now has stake of control over the d5 square (white square) and black now has stake on the d4 square (black). However, white's pawn on e4 pretty much seals that square but places it under future threat, for which white has to defend. I like to take the outside control approach.} 2. Nf3 d6 {Protecting c5 pawn, not allowing for Nf3 to get to the e5 square, and expanding my queen side.} 3. g3 {Fianchetto comin right up.} Nc6 4. Bg2 {Oh dear... white has developed really well. Has stake over the center, ready to castle, and all set for an attack on my poorly developed king side. Or maybe i'm getting too far ahead of myself...} Nf6 5. O-O g6 6. Nc3 Bg7 {Fianchetto.} 7. d4 {First strike: i'm opting for just a knight trade. But here's probably one of the many mistakes i made: but trading the knights, i've opened up his fianchetto. Plus, it will eventually open up the e file for his rook. I had to ensure that the file is protected.} cxd4 8. Nxd4 Nxd4 9. Qxd4 O-O 10. Bd2 {(??) I know that white's intending to bring the other castle into play, but i thought Bg5 was a bit better cos it will then stop black from playing the e7 pawn as it would create a pin on the Nf6} e5 11. Qe3 Be6 12. Nd5 {Here's an interesting scenario: i didn't realise it before, but now i've got a nice little c file to occupy. at the same token, i'm weary about the knight jumping on e7 and causing havoc. So, here's how i played the hand i was dealt...} Rc8 13. Qxa7 Rxc2 14. Ba5 {b7 pawn is under threat. So, i've got to protect it with my queen and test out how much he cares about his queen. As the game continues, I will demonstrate how much importance was placed on the white queen and how that was white's ultimate demise.} Qa8 15. Qb6 {When i saw this, i knew that he really cares about his queen. Now, i'm going to try and work to move the queen around as much as i can, thus resulting in white's loss of tempo. Never leave the work of the game rest on the shoulders of only one piece.} Nxd5 16. exd5 Bf5 17. Qb4 {Another mistake from Black: at this point i can move e5-e4. This will block the Bg2 bishop and releases the diagonal my bishop on g7 rests. If there was an exchange in the two white square bishops, i will still win the bishop on a5 as its no longer protected by the queen. Oh well, what follows is just as good i suppose...} Rc5 18. Bb6 Rc2 19. Rac1 Rfc8 20. Be3 e4 {Ah, all i need is for white to take the pawn on e4...} 21. Bxe4 {Woo hoo! Free bishop!} Rxb2 22. Qxd6 {Well, that was the first of many moves to come made just by the queen. During this time, i developed my pieces enough to create a mating opportunity. This loss of tempo is really damaging at this point in the game, because you need to develop the right opportunity to end the game.} Bxe4 {And now, i saw a potential mating opportunity, since my queen occupies a strong diagonal. However, the pawns on b7 and d4 are blocking it, and my bishop on e4 needs to protect the g2 square. Its a long shot, but in the process of setting it up, it will open up other doors.} 23. Qe7 Bxd5 24. Qd7 Be6 {Perfect. Protecting my rook on c8, threatening the queen, and getting the bishop on e6 ready to move to Bh3.} 25. Qd6 Rd8 26. Qc5 b5 27. a3 Bh3 {Well, that's the final move. At this point, there's nothing much white can do. If white moves f2-f3, that opens up an opportunity for a fork with my black square bishop. If white moves the rook on f1, then its game over.} 28. Rfe1 Qg2# {Hope you have enjoyed this game. Its all about tempo and ensuring that a piece is not moved around too much, compromising development of other pieces. My opponent played really well, and i had to really think ahead. Thanks and hope you enjoyed it!}
