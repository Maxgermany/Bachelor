[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 e6 {Haven't found a non e4-opening to stick with me yet, so we begin with the French defense!} 2. d4 {For the most part, when Black tries to wade in via these more passive pawn-openers, I enjoy going for the center immediately. However, Black has an intriguing variation in mind... } Qf6 {Just like that, it took my opponent merely two moves to rip us violently off of the databases.} 3. Nf3 {Not e5 just yet. I want to make sure I have some decent stake in development before I start launching a Queen-chase. And frankly, f3 is an amazing square for White's knight in the openings.} h6 {Deterring Bg5, but honestly, even though one of my strongest moves just got blocked, the Black Queen is just too open to not end up suffering anyway.} 4. c4 {I eagerly grip more of the center. White has several options.} Nc6 {Also playable is g6, perhaps stronger, considering. Black clearly wants control of b4.} 5. Nc3 {I really don't mind the idea of Bb4. My central development is nearly complete.} Bb4 {Black continues the plan to pin my knight, threatening a doubling of the c pawns.} 6. e5 {Instead, I hit the queen. I could have played this several moves ago, but allowing Black to explore with other pieces almost seems to have cramped him worse than if I let my enemy remain virtually sealed by just chasing immediately all those moves ago.} Qe7 {Black's Queen doesn't have many places to go. If Qg6, then forced becomes Nh4! Qh7, Bd3 g6, or else the Queen must be given up. In this line, the kingside is cramped and misplaced, and slightly more defensible for Black would appear to be aiming for a O-O-O. But this would require at least two more moves of development, and White already has an attacking synergy. If Qd8, O-O-O is virtually outright discouraged and Black has lost massive amounts of tempo. White has a clear advantage here already- which you're about to see me blow completely.} 7. d5 {Ugh. When I was looking through this, I was telling myself that I didn't really care so much had Black played Bxc3, because if Bxc3+, bxc3 seems to help White move control of the center along. White would have pawns on c3-d4-e5, which allows my side of the board more space to pressure Black for being too cramped in. The doubled pawn on c4 could go to c5, and help me control virtually every dark square that I'd need to pressure Black's King wherever they decide to castle. So I play this, thinking I can keep boxing Black in, while completely forgetting that this was just about my worst possible move. d4 was so central to all of my attacking and defending plans. This was just an awful case of a brain lapse on my part.} exd5 {I mean- seriously, I told myself my Queen had this square covered, but how in the heck did I forget the fact that my king now has two pieces pinned to it?!} 8. Qxd5 {So I continue my plan to capture on d5 with the Queen, (cxd5 would come under fire after Qxe5+, which I can tell is coming at this point), but in hindsight, I was cursing at myself for being so greedy and careless. A huge White advantage thrown at me within the first two moves of the match, just for me to throw it right back in one huge overstep. I was pretty flustered by this point.} Nf6 {I was really going wild with how much I hated my 7th at this point. :P} 9. Qd3 {Not Qd2. I wasn't comfortable putting my queen in front of the king with the Bishop there. Also not Qd1, as allowing c4 and e4 to have fewer defenders would be dangerous at this point.} Nxe5 {Black gives me back more control of d4, while costing me my better knight.} 10. Nxe5 {Forced.} Qxe5+ {And here's the dropkick. Do I block with a bishop, or the Queen?} 11. Be2 {I figured the option that allows me quicker castling was probably safer at this point. Now that Black's energy has returned to the board, trading Queens probably wouldn't be in my interests either.} O-O {Black takes the chance to castle while I struggle to get back on my feet.} 12. O-O {Hiding my king, developing the rook and breaking two pins, but even after all that, Black is still much better and with more tempo for the time being.} Bd6 {He tries this, hoping I don't see it. Frankly, he probably had better options, starting with perhaps actually capturing the knight? Bxc3 looks far more stronger to me.} 13. g3 {Blocking the mate, but not by moving the other pawn to f4 because Black can launch some nasty attacks on the exposed king, starting from ...Bc5+!} b6 {Now, Black plays this. As to why, I haven't the faintest. In merely ten moves, the entire position is thrown right back in Black's face. An opening blunder, followed by my own throwaway, and this begins probably the biggest meltdown I've ever had the joy of unfolding in a game of my own...} 14. Bf3 {After I saw b6 played, I literally was like "First of all...", driving a wedge in with this. I see the other more obvious move, but why not liberate my pieces in more of an aggressive position first?} c6 {Bb7 obviously doesn't work, but this is just as much of a disaster. The only saving move was Rb8. In just two moves, GK says I've gone from about -1.2 to about +4.5, and I really can't say I disagree.} 15. Bf4 {Shish kebab bishop, right here! Worse- the queen has nowhere good to go!} Qa5 {There weren't many choices. Black does have Qe6- being met by White's Rfe1, to play Qh3. But the Queen doesn't do much there. Any further back kills the Rook after Bxd6, so if Black didn't want to retreat the Queen, this is his only alternative as any other square is a dropped piece.} 16. Bxd6 {Well, I'd probably have prefered Qe6, in hindsight, although this bishop was always doomed.} Re8 {My own Re1 isn't going to be as strong now. In fact, this becomes Black's strongest defender. It's a pretty good move to beat me to the open rank, but...} 17. b4 {-there just isn't going to be enough time anymore. Frankly, even the Queen Trap had Black played ...Qg6 on their 6th wouldn't be nearly as devastating as this.} Qa6 {It's either play this, and have the Queen trapped among fellow Black pieces, or play Qa3, having the queen trapped among enemy White pieces after 18. b5.} 18. b5 {Okay, let's see here... Black cannot play Qa5, or- a3! c5, Bxa8 and White takes the Rook absolutely free of charge and the Queen is too trapped to do anything about it. So if Black can't play Qa5, the other line was 17. b4 (Qa3), b5 Qb2, 19. Rab1 and the Queen falls after that- so Black cornered both royals after not answering 15. Bf4 with ...Qe6. Was there really no saving this queen, besides spotting this overly convoluted trap all the way back from his three moves ago?} Qb7 {Anyway, if not Qe6-Qh3 all that time ago, the Queen enters the enclosed Black Queenside corner, never to return to the game again, along with the lonely Ra8. I never dreamed of the bishop on d6 being as damaging as it has been at this point!} 19. Rad1 {A waiting move, mostly. I want to keep d6 under my control, no matter what the cost is to keeping it this way. The longer Black goes on, forced to pin the d7-c6 pawns, the effective score for White is a LOT higher than just "+2", as now I only need to deal with three pawns, a rook, and a knight.} a6 {A desperate attempt to open the corner.} 20. a4 {Not happening.} a5 {If Black captured, White plays cxb5, NOT axb5. The only pawn freed from there is the pawn on c6, and it just cannot be allowed to move under the current circumstances.} 21. Qf5 {With Black's Q-side on lockdown, I start turning my focus to the kingside.} Re6 {Meh. Black tries to prepare for his next move. I don't like this move, but I've got no better alternatives for Black, as the King is just beyond saving at this point.} 22. Rfe1 {One rook, one knight, three pawns. Once they fall, the Black King is left staring alone in a faceoff with my remaining pieces, and that will never change for as long as the c6-d7 pawns are pinned. And it's about to get a whole lot more ugly for Black: with the rook on e6, capture is unavoidable.} g6 {Black realizes this, but figures there's safety by trying to kick the Queen away. GK recommends Qh3, threatening Qxh6. Instead, I play an even stronger move. } 23. Rxe6 {Black must now decide if opening the confined corner is worth me keeping my queen....!!!!} gxf5 {In the end, it's decided against, and Black captures my strongest piece.} 24. Rxf6 {In return, Black's remaining power pieces remain imprisoned, and they will never reach the King to save it in time, as all that remains for his safety are mismatched pawns.} Kg7 {The King comes to shoo my Rook away. } 25. Rxf5 {I also had Be5, threatening discovered check, but doing that allows ...d6!, from Black.} Qa7 {Black desperately tries to free his queen, an attempt that just walked the King into an apparent Mate in 8. I didn't spot the forced mate from start to finish, but here I had a good idea of how to build the mating net. Can someone walk me through how the Mate was SUPPOSED to go?} 26. Bh5 {I start here, removing the King's most aggressive flight square.} f6 {Forced, or Rxf7+ wins faster.} 27. Re1 {But with d7 frozen in place, the other Rook can enter the mating trap without issue. Gameknot still says I'm wasting time, and that I'm still within Mate in 8.} cxb5 {-And now it's Mate in 5. So the computer states every time Black attempts to free the pieces, it's a losing blunder, but honestly, what other choice is there?} 28. Re7+ {Now there's only the Back Rank, and my key proximal pieces are guarded.} Kh8 {I was surprised to see him back into the corner, though. It's a fantastic flight square, really- somehow, I couldn't really see how I could Mate with only the four pieces. And I had to act with more precision right away- if I screw up the next move, Black plays Bb7, freeing the rook to defend, and it's only going to get harder to threaten the Mate!} 29. Ne4 {And at the end of the day, it turns out that had Black merely played Bxc3+ all that time ago, I might not have been able to win the game at all! Not only was this knight lucky to be alive, it likely turned out to be the very reason I won this game without endless perpetuals!} bxc4 {And here, I think Black realized Mate in 2 was unavoidable, and signals having given up.} 30. Nxf6 c3 31. Rh7# {And here it is! The completed Mating net. Trying to get better at these, but all the sharp play this game demanded from me in order to keep on my feet made playing my opponent so much more fun. There was a lot of unusual play, unusual play that I had to keep myself focused on careful, calculated moves, because I saw the punishment in overstepping too soon before the game had ended. There was another game as Black I had due to the League setup, which was just as fun, albeit it more obvious and quicker. Hope you enjoyed reading this game as much as I enjoyed playing it!
