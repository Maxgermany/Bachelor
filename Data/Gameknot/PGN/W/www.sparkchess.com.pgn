1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 {I came across this website "Sparkchess" [www.sparkchess.com] which allows a game at four different levels, without having to download anything. It's good fun: The levels are 'Beginner'; 'Casual'; 'Advanced' and 'Guru' - although it warns that the higher level takes some time to make its moves.  Players can judge its standard from the following game at the second highest level.} 6. Bg5 {The Jackal Attack} f6 7. exf6 gxf6 {This is going to require some very accurate defensive moves.} 8. Bh4 cxd4 9. Nxd4 {Could I mate in under 21 moves? I asked myself:} Kf7 {Very possibly! On 9...Qe7 I was intending 10.Be2. The move 10.Ndb5 is almost certainly better but is a bit less likely to mate.} 10. Qh5+ Ke7 {Now would I pick the best move? The short answer is 'No'. Best here is 11.Nf5! while 11.Nxe6 is also very strong. My excuse is that I was playing my moves very fast - my wife left me - I had to catch a train - but most of all - I wanted to 'save up' the N-f5 move.} 11. Nxd5+ {This is good anyway. On the objectively stronger 11.Nf5 exf5 12.Nxd5+ Kd6 13.O-O-O is crushing.} exd5 12. Nf5+ Ke6 {So now the kink cannot retreat backwards for the time being.} 13. O-O-O Nc6 {Now the very best move is 14.c4} 14. Bc4 {But this is also very strong - and more in the  'coffee-house' style.} dxc4 15. Rhe1+ Nce5 {Now 16.Rxe5 wins the queen. The trouble is that the chances of beating the 21 move deadline will probably evaporate after 16...Nxe5 17.Rxd8 Ng6 because of a check with ...Bh6} 16. f4 {Keeps all the pieces on the board.} Qa5 17. fxe5 fxe5 {Now - here I had my chance - and I blew it. It's a mate in three after the obvious 18.Qe8+ Kxf5 19.Qf7+ Nf6 20.Qxf6 Kg4 21.Qg5#} 18. g4 {I was too keen to keep my precious knight.} Nf6 19. Bxf6 Kxf6 20. Ref1 Bxf5 21. Qxf5+ Ke7 22. Qf7# {One move out.}
