1. g3 {A "Walking The Walk" Club game.  Thank you to brigadecommander for playing.  My assessment is that questionable moves by white at 15 and 16 and then unwisely forging ahead with a bad plan at 17 and 18 clinched the loss.   } d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {effectively a queen's pawn game.} Nf6 4. Bg2 g6 5. O-O Bg7 6. b3 O-O 7. Bb2 Bg4 8. h3 Bf5 9. Nbd2 Qc8 10. Kh2 Rd8 11. Nh4 {trying to reduce black's arsenal while bringing my bishop and f-pawn more in to play.} Be6 {11. ...Be6} 12. f4 {12. f4...} a5 {perhaps 8. h3 and 12. f4 have invited a side attack on the white king's position.  at this point, even though neither king is facing a threat, it is easy to see that black's king is much more safely situated than white's. will this be a key factor in the outcome of the game? } 13. c3 {couldn't commit to a plan to remove black's d-pawn and so played c3 to hinder her knight.  but since I went on to c4 soon, this move wasted time.} a4 14. bxa4 {noticing that white is very porous here while black has retained all of her pawns' potential, keeping them well fed and housed and in reserve.  perhaps white can proceed with a plan that plays off an early space advantage.  or perhaps black will break apart white's overly advanced pawns and gain control of valuable central real estate.} Bd7 15. Qc2 {an ok move by itself, BUT it may be the start of my problems a few moves later.  I wanted to remove black's central pawn.  but if the c-pawn was going to be involved, this move has the problem of ...Nb4.   } Ra6 16. a3 {almost played Nb3 (probably a better choice, ...possibly wins bishop with Nc5).  this a3 is part of white's overcommitment to the poor plan of c4 (and it's failure to take in to account the problems of putting the knight on c4).  } Na5 17. c4 {at this point, I had been thinking black attacks c4 twice.  but c4 is really attacked three times because the black bishop can go to b5 after BxP (if NxP and NxN now).  a bit tricky but not something I should have missed.  Had I played 15. Qc1 instead of Qc2 (or not played 18. NxN coming up), this problem would have been avoided.} Nxc4 {white should have taken his lumps and left the black knight alone.  the idea that the white e-pawn could advance once black's d-pawn was removed played in to the irrational...} 18. Nxc4 {...NxN, which seals the game.  or perhaps commenters will find a way to proceed even once 18. Nxc4 has been played.} Bxa4 {BxP.  } 19. Qd3 Bb5 {Bb5, as expected (too late).  I dislike black's central pawn more and more, and it is now causing me more trouble than before. so...} 20. Bxd5 {...BxP.  allows a white rook to move to c1 in time to prevent too much damage and may enable white to have a strong pawn presence in the center.} Nxd5 {NxB.} 21. Nf3 {prevents white from having to defend knight on c4 with heavy pieces.  BUT misses that it gives black a fork of white's queen and rook after BxN & QxB.  had seen that but rushed a bit and will now pay.  thought about proposing a bending of the club rulez here, ...resign and start a new game.  but went a head with some very dull mechanical play.} Bxc4 22. Qxc4 Ne3 23. Qc1 Nxf1+ 24. Qxf1 Rb6 25. Bc3 Rb3 {25. Rb3} 26. Bb4 Bxd4 {BxP.  earlier, I thought I could respond to this with Rd1.  worked out that that was a poor option.  I did not want to be w/o my knight, but...} 27. Nxd4 {went ahead with NxB.  had I seen ANY decent other options for the knight, I would have kept it in the game.  unhappily, its best use seemed to be to remove the bishop.} Rxd4 {RxP.} 28. Bxe7 {BxP.} Qe6 29. Bc5 {gives the bishop a chance to help defend the king if necessary. earlier observation that white's king's position is weak plays in here.    } Rd2 {white resigns.  broke club "rulez" a bit here by not playing further. but my past 12 moves had been uninspiring and that took a toll on my enthusiasm toward continuing.  prospects for continuing play were not great either.  still, a fun game.  many lessons learned.  thanks again to brigadecommander for playing.   }
