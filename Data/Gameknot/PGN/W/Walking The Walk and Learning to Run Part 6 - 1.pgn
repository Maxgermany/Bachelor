1. d4 {First, I would say the score is not the reality of this game. I was outplayed all the game.} d5 2. e3 {I had annotated in the same time i played the moves. I don't move the pieces to work visualization, i don't use a computer, so all can be totally wrong. ______ About analysis the game, in post-mortem, i try to look : __1.opening Who know the most theoretical moves ? if not me i have to work the opening.  __  2. Middle game Did i seen the opponent threat on each moves ? Did i had a plan ?  __  3.Ending Did i had a plan ? Did i know the technique needed ?  __  4.Other Where is the/a turn of the game Find my mistakes (strategy ? tactics ? ) and study the weakness. ?  Which move i would like to take back ? Which move i am glad to had played ?} Nf6 3. Bd3 e6 4. Nd2 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. f4 {The end of this thematic tournament. Glad to play in because i learn this opening.} Bd6 7. Ndf3 {to be able to catch d4 with e3} O-O 8. Ne5 {The usual place for a knight.} Ne4 9. Ngf3 f5 {POST-MORTEM, this pawn strucure and both Ne4-Ne5 is call double stonewall by Soltis. I still don't have read this part of his book. So no idea of an usual plan. I had try Qc2 both time in this MT and both time is was a mistake or i  hadn't been able to play it. ___ now i suppose Qe2 is a better place like in the dutch stonewall.} 10. O-O Bd7 11. Qc2 {This time i try a no king side attack rush __ POST-MORTEM, the turn of the game. And also the move i would like to takeback. Probably Qe2 and not Qc2, but i don't know if there is a " theory about ". So the stonewall middle game is where i have to learn.} cxd4 12. exd4 Qe8 13. b3 {I don't know what i can play, because i had read b3-Bb2 is often played i do this. I suppose it wil not be bad. POST-MORTEM : it is bad :-) c3 is weak and the column c is half open for black.} Rc8 14. Bb2 Bxe5 15. Nxe5 Nxd4 {Ok, so c3 was pinned. Never a good idea to let an opposite rook and our queen on the same column.} 16. Qd1 Nc6 17. Bxe4 {2 knights on the 4th rank, i dislike so already one less.} fxe4 {The position seems to be difficult for me (nice centre, pawn passed for black) because i just see advantage for black and what plan I could have ? I don't see any available move.__18.c4 Nxe5 19.Bxe5 dxc4 20.bxc4 Rxc4__18.a4 Nxe5 19.fxe5 perhaps white position stay in ?} 18. a4 Nxe5 19. fxe5 Rxf1+ {oh oh, so much exchanges means black has something in mind.} 20. Qxf1 Qd8 21. b4 {21.b4 Qb6+ 22.Qf2 Qxf2+ 23.Kxf2 and perhaps my position is ok ?___ or ___21.b4 Qb6 22.Qf2 e3 23.Qe2 and perhaps i can create threat on e3 after a4-a5} Qb6+ 22. Qf2 Qxf2+ 23. Kxf2 Rf8+ {perhaps black will play then 24...Rf5, aoutch, i will look how boring it is if he plays this} 24. Ke3 Rf5 {25.Kd4 is not possible because 25...Rf2___may 25.c4 is possible ?__25.c4 dxc 26.b5 (free 27.Rc1) a6 27.b6 (27...a5 seems wrong because Ra1 can threat c4, go back to a1 or the 4th rank. But difficult to visualize.} 25. c4 {POST-MORTEM, this is the move i am glad (not so much because i don't think i have other choice)} dxc4 26. b5 Rg5 {ok, the end of my visualization__I realize i don't know really how to play pawns vs a rook. can i push the pawns or the rook just have to move column to column and take a pawn (if enough room) ? I have to go to ABC of the endgames to try to learn.__27.g3 Rh5 28.h4 (Rg5 is not possible nice) Rf5 29.Rc4} 27. g3 Rh5 28. h4 g5 {29.hxg Rxg 30.Kf4 Rg7 31.Rc1, difficult to visualize.} 29. hxg5 Rxg5 30. Kf4 h6 31. g4 {31.g4 to prevent the push of the pawn h, Rf5+ is not possible too 31...Be8 32.Rc1 __or__31.Bg5 a3 32.bxa6 bxa6 33.Rc1 Bxa4 34.Rxc4 (looks difficult to defend against a pawn on a and one on h)______ i realize after having played 31...Be8 is not possible 32.Rd1 Bg6 33.Rd8+___ and to be honnest i don't have the feeling i will have back my two pawns.} a6 {32.Rd1 can be interesting 32...Be8 33.Rd8 Kf8 34.bxa6 bxa6 35.a8 or 35.Rxx, difficult to visualize but Bb5 keeps most of the pawns but i think my position has improve now.} 32. Rd1 Kg7 33. Rxd7+ {the score will be probably different now.} Kg8 34. Rxb7 {I think black is black is over, Rg5-Ph6 can't move, Bb2 can stop c4 and e4 but.... 34...axb 35.axb Kf8 36.b6 Ke8 I am not abble to push b6 __ 37.Rc7 Kd8 38.Rxc4 Rg7 39.Rc7 Rxc7 40.bxc7 Kxc7 41.Kxe4 Xxx 42.Bc1 and h will fall. And i suppose i will be able to have a queen.} axb5 35. axb5 Kh8 {36...Rg8 I suppose ___ 36.b6 Rg8 37.Rc7 Rf8+ 38.Kxe4 Rg8 39.Kf4 Rf8+ 40.Kg3} 36. b6 Rg8 37. Rc7 h5 38. gxh5 {}
