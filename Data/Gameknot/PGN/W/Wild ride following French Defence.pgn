[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 e6 {I really don't like playing against the French; pushing the e-pawn to e5 seems dubious, but White often ends up playing it. But not here...} 2. d4 c5 {Straightaway we are not going to see the usual French. I gather taking the pawn leads to some sort of Benoni game, which I didn't fancy. Nor did I like the idea of advancing the d-pawn.} 3. Nf3 {I try to steer the game into a more familiar Sicilian.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 5. Nb3 {5.Be3 is better, developing a piece and defending the Knight. But this attacks Black's Bishop, so no real tempo has been lost.} Bb6 {Black uses a move to retreat the Bishop.} 6. Nc3 {I'm already slightly ahead in development.} Nc6 {6...Ne7 allows Black quicker castling, which is probably better.} 7. Bf4 {Possibly not the best move, since Black can just drive the Bishop back by advancing the e-pawn and gaining space.} e5 {Which he does.} 8. Bg3 {Going back along the c1-h6 diagonal makes the previous move a little pointless; this covers f2, something that grows to be most important!} h5 {Logical, I guess, to try to trap the Bishop.} 9. h4 {Equally logical and necessary to prevent it.} d6 {Black is probably better getting out the other Knight, but my opponent likes attacking, risky and unusual strategies, and that Bishop could find a nice square on g4 supported by the h-pawn.} 10. Be2 {Interestingly, I'm already slipping into a defensive mind-set, protecting g4, when 10. Qd2 followed by Q-side castling might give me a better edge.} Nf6 {Black gets out his other Knight.} 11. Qd2 {I prepare for castling Q-side.} Be6 {Black gets out his last minor piece and threatens to double my pawns.} 12. Qg5 {Very suspect, in retrospect. This early sorte by the Queen results in Black gaining a momentum by driving it back and back and back...} Bxb3 {First, though, he carries out his plan to double my pawns, at the same time taking away the defender of the d4 square, something I hadn't really considered a problem.} 13. axb3 Nd4 {But Black has thought of it and has a nice, if temporary, spot for his Knight.} 14. Bd3 {My Queen is positively begging to be brought back, but I still feel there's a worthy attack. Somewhere.} Ne6 {d4 proves just a stepping stone in the start of Black's Queen-harrassing.} 15. Qf5 {The Queen really isn't getting the message!} Ng4 {Building up a nice attack on f7, but with the Bishop guarding that square it's rather toothless - and Black has left d5 unguarded.} 16. Nd5 {So I follow his early example and post a Knight there.} g6 {Black continues to hassle the Queen.} 17. Qf3 {Back she goes...} Nd4 18. Qd1 {Back, in fact, to the starting square, proving what a silly move Qg5 was.} O-O 19. c3 {Black finally castles behind a somewhat weakened defence. The computer actually has me ahead, but it didn't feel that way, as I drive away one Knight.} Ne6 20. Be2 {And get ready to do the same to the other.} f5 {Black doesn't want to retreat the Knight, and here I should have taken full advantage of the weakened Black defence with 21.exf5 gxf5 22.Bc4. I didn't because I thought Black might recapture the f-pawn with his Rook, building up his attack on f2. But that would have fallen foul of 22.Bxg4 followed by 23.Qxg4 and White is on top.} 21. Nxb6 {Instead I give up my nicely posted Knight for the Bishop that's been bearing down onto f2.} Qxb6 {Now I have the Black Queen on the same diagonal. Not the smartest move.} 22. Qd5 {I do get my own Queen to the centre of the board, though exchanging pawns on f5 first was still advisable.} Rf6 {Better to bring out the other Rook and defend from e8; I still have the option of exchanging on f5...} 23. Rd1 {Instead I build up against the d-pawn, letting another chance to exchange on f5 go} Rd8 {Black defends the d-pawn} 24. O-O {And here I blunder, not only passing up my chance for 24.exf5 gxf5 but castling into a mass of advancing pawns...} Kg7 {First, though, Black gives me one more chance by stepping aside with his King to unpin the Knight.} 25. Rd3 {I want to double up my Rooks, but I don't get chance...} f4 {Having unpinned the Knight, Black doesn't attack the Rook with 25...Nc5, but drives back the Bishop instead.} 26. Bh2 Nc7 {Black begins to chase my Queen again.} 27. Qc4 {Black could now play 27...Ne6, threatening 28..Nc5...} Nxh2 {Instead he rather loses momentum by exchanging off his nicely placed Knight.} 28. Kxh2 Qc6 {Offering a Queen exchange that I don't fancy, even though it takes a bit of the pressure off and allows me to seize the open a-file with the Rook afterwards.} 29. Rf3 {Instead I allow Black to exchange if he wants...} Ne6 {But he doesn't. I think we both wanted to keep potential attacks going and didn't want to go down to an endgame just yet.} 30. g3 {Opening up the position, something I really do at my peril. But the game is being played at such a fast and furious rate I'm hoping there will be a few attacking chances.} g5 {Black makes the psotion very complicated indeed, and I really needed to spend some time analysing it before going ahead.} 31. gxf4 g4 32. fxe5 {There are not many hiding places for the Kings now!} Rxf3 {Black can't afford to take with the pawn as my capture of his Rook results in a check!} 33. Qxe6 {Now I'm banking on counterplay, with the Black King exposed.} Re8 34. Qxd6 {I doubt very much Black will fancy a Queen exchange to allow those two pawns to link up, though it's probably hsi best bet. Instead he tries something speculative...} Rh3+ 35. Kg1 {Only two squares for the King and clearly g2 is lethal after 35...Qxe4+} Qxe4 {It looks pretty dangerous without the check.} 36. Qf6+ {But now I have the counterplay I want, and the game is very evenly balanced. Whoever blunders first might be the loser!} Kh7 37. Qf7+ Kh6 {And oh, how I want to take the Rook. But mate on h1 awaits me if I do. I guess the game could have ended in a draw by repetition here. But I'm starting to fancy my chances!} 38. Qf6+ Qg6 {Maybe Black thinks I'm after the draw and tries this, which hands me a big advantage...} 39. Qf4+ Kg7 {Now there's little to stop my Rook getting to d7 via d1.} 40. Qd4 {Alas! I hand the initiative, and possibly the game, back to Black, by setting up this very obvious revealed check.} Qe6 {Whichj Black stops right away. It's not even that dangerous: 40...Qf5 41.e6+ Qf6 42.Bc4 Qxd4 Black still holds the advantage.} 41. f4 {Ooooh but this is risky, even if I do get two passed pawns; that g-pawn is now looking hungry for Queening.} g3 {Forward it goes. And curiously, this ought to have been the losing move for Black: 42.f5 Qb6 43.f6+ Kf8 44.Rf5 Qxd4+ 45.cxd4 Rxh4 46.Bxh5 is surely enough. But I just see that unguarded pawn on h5...} 42. Bxh5 {And think I have time to take it!} Rh1+ {As soon as Black played this I knew I was sunk. But as I've said, it was a game played at breakneck speed and understandable that Black missed a mate.} 43. Kg2 {Obviously taking the Rook is suicide.} Qh3+ {It's looking grim anyway.} 44. Kf3 {Now, 44...g2+ is deadly...} Rxf1+ {But Black also just sees the material.} 45. Ke4 {My King is on the run, and it's surely only a matter of time?} Qg2+ {45...Re1 brought mate closer, but I'm still sunk, I think.} 46. Kf5 Rf8+ 47. Kg5 {I thought I'd escaped here, and I've certainly escaped the checks for a move or sao.} Rf1xf4 48. Qd7+ {Now it's my turn for a check or two, though Black still has, incredibly, a forced mate. But it's in 12 moves so I escaped.} Kh8 {I expected Black to interpose a Rook on f7, but his King scurries away instead.} 49. Bg6 {Now I'm getting ready to deliver mate myself on h7. In my dreams... 49...Rxh4 50.Bf5 Qh1 51.Qd6 Rh5+ 52.Kf4 Rfxf5+ is the computer's continuation, ending in mate a few moves later. To my surprise, Black decides to liquidate the position...} Rf4f5+ 50. Bxf5 Rxf5+ 51. Qxf5 {I don't know whether Black missed something here, but now I am right back in the game, though with that pawn sitting on g3 it's probably drawn?} Qf2 {Yes, taking that Queen would be the answer to Black's prayers.} 52. Qc8+ {I'm looking for drawing chances now; surely I can keep that King pinned down with perpetual checks?} Kg7 53. Qxb7+ {Actually, 53.h5 is more threatening; h6+ would be a difficult one for Black. But I'm focussed on keeping the Black King in check. And this square with my Queen covers g2.} Kg8 54. e6 {Oh dear; 54.Qd5+ keeps the Black King on its toes, but suddenly I think I have winning chances (nope) and foolishly hand the initiative back to Black.} g2 {Now that pawn really is dangerous, especially with my King on the g-file, something that might have been crucial.} 55. Qa8+ {I must keep the checks going now.} Kh7 56. Qe4+ Kh8 57. Qa8+ Kh7 {I keep them going long enough for Black to offer the draw, which I gratefully accepted. Interesting to speculate about 58.Qb7+ Kg8 59.Qb8+ Qf8 60.Qxa7 g1=Q+ 61.Qxg1 Qg7+ 62.Kf5 Qxg1... but the game's pace meant that it went begging. A really wild one.}
