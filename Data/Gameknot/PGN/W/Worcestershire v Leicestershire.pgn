1. d4 {So I start with my usual.} c6 {He invites a Caro-Kann, which would arise if I play 2. e4, and he replies with d5. I am sure he knows more about it than me, so I avoid that!} 2. c4 {So I invite a Slav defence with d5} f5 {But he avoids that and opts for a Dutch Defence.} 3. Nc3 {So I develop.} Nf6 {He does the natural developing move too.} 4. g3 {And me also.} g6 {He opts for a Leningrad formation, with his bishop on g7 rather than playing e7-e6 and developing it along the f8-a3 diagonal.} 5. Bg2 {I continue to develop.} Bg7 {As does he.} 6. e4 {So I grab the centre.} fxe4 {He takes.} 7. Nxe4 {I take back.} O-O {He castles.} 8. Ne2 {I play the natural developing move too. I am planning 0-0 and Ne2-c3 to back up the knight on e4.} Nxe4 {So he takes before I can get the knight round.} 9. Bxe4 {I take back. e4 is a lovely square for one of my minor pieces, but it would be even better to have a knight on this square rather than a bishop.} e5 {I am not sure about this move. After my next, the range of his Bg7 is limited, and my minor piece on e4 is unable to be shifted by a pawn.} 10. d5 {So I close up the position.} Qb6 {This move surprised me. He has pressure on f2 and b2, but is this move really better than simple development such as d6?} 11. O-O {So I castle and protect f2.} c5 {He blocks the position up.} 12. d6 {This is a double edged move. If I can maintain this pawn here, it may be very hard for him to develop his queen-side pieces. This d6 pawn also cuts his position in two and may hinder him from moving pieces from the queen-side to the king-side and vice versa. On the other hand this advanced pawn could end up being weak and lost. Also d5-d6 allows his knight to develop to c6 and then d5.} Nc6 {So his knight comes out.} 13. Qd5+ {I throw in the queen check. This means that if he plays Nd4, at least I will have the queen on my d6 pawn. Also the queen is quite powerfully centralised.} Kh8 {So his king goes into the corner.} 14. b3 {b3 is played so that I can move my Bc1 without losing the b2 pawn. Also, if he does play Nd4, I can take with the knight and then protect d6 by the bishop on either a3 or f4. I may also be able to play Bg5-e7 in some variations.} Nb4 {So the knight comes in this way instead.} 15. Qd2 {This is the only square for the queen. if Qd1 i just lose the d6 pawn to Rf6. If now Rf6 16. Rd1	Bf8 17. Bb2	and if Rxd6 then Bxe5+ or Bxd6 then Qg5, in both cases with advantage to white. So black's best is to retreat the knight and threaten Nd4 again.} Nc6 {and now I have to play Qd5 again, otherwise Nd4 is going to cut off my support of my d6 pawn.} 16. Qd5 {So I return.} Nb4 {And he goes back, and draw agreed. Many thanks for reading this annotation. Please rate it on the star system and add a comment or two.}
