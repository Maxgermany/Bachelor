1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 4. Bxc4 e6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6. Nbd2 c6 7. a3 Bd6 8. b4 O-O 9. Bb2 Nb6 10. Bd3 Nbd5 11. O-O a5 {Trying to get the extra Queenside pawn.} 12. b5 cxb5 13. Bxb5 Nc7 14. Bd3 b5 15. Ne4 Nxe4 16. Bxe4 Rb8 17. Qc2 h6 18. Ne5 Bxe5 {Has the advantage of doubling Whites e-pawns, but the disadvantage of giving White the Bishop pair. I hoped in light of the extra Queenside pawn and the blockading of Whites dark-squares Bishop by his own pawn on e5, the net strategic effect was an advantage for Black.} 19. dxe5 Bb7 {Obviously, this is a verrrry slow opening for Black :-)} 20. Rfd1 Bxe4 {Eliminates Whites Bishop pair advantage.} 21. Qxe4 Nd5 22. Rac1 Qe7 {It only took Black twenty-two moves to get developed!} 23. g3 b4 {Looking for a passed pawn deep in White territory.} 24. axb4 axb4 25. Rc4 Rfc8 {Looking for an endgame where Whites King can't cover the Kingside and Queenside simultaneously. I was very aware, and afraid of the potential negative effects, of Whites ability to dislodge the Knight with e3-e4. I also thought about the pawn structure weakness for White that would come with e3-e4.} 26. Rdc1 Rxc4 27. Qxc4 Qe8 28. e4 Ne7 29. Kg2 Qb5 30. f3 Qxc4 {Continuously working toward a Queenside that required Whites Kings assistance. At this point in time, I thought there would be a game of cat-and-mouse between Blacks Knight and Rook, and Whites Bishop, Rook, and King. I didn't know who would win that battle, and didn't know if Black would be able to take control of the Kingside as a result of it.} 31. Rxc4 b3 32. Rc7 {This seems like a waste of time for White, and the continuation leaves Whites Bishop in the unenviable position of being overworked. That White pawn on e5 was looking weaker and weaker all the time.} Kf8 33. Kf2 Ke8 {Probably a wasted move. I was waffling on the best way to try to limit Whites Rooks mobility and/or get my King in the action.} 34. Ke2 Rb6 35. Kd2 {White needed to be careful here about his potentially vulnerable h-pawn due to the skewer with his King on the second rank.} Nc6 36. Rc8+ {I didn't like this at all for White. It loses the e-pawn, takes his Rook out of the action, and the continuation left him with a lot of work to extricate his Rook after being trapped in enemy territory. I was thinking maybe f3-f4 or Kc1 instead.} Kd7 37. Rg8 g6 38. Rh8 Nxe5 39. Bxe5 b2 40. Bxb2 Rxb2+ 41. Ke3 Rxh2 42. f4 h5 43. Rh7 Ke7 44. e5 Ra2 45. Kf3 Ra3+ 46. Kg2 Ra8 47. Kh3 Ra7 48. g4 hxg4+ 49.
