[Opening "Reti (A05), King's Indian attack, Spassky's variation"]

1. Nf3 {Reti. I intend on the Fianchetto at this point, but what I like about f3 is there are so many options. I've learned this is probably not a good opening when I'm playing a more advanced player. } Nf6 {Book} 2. g3 {I have had some success against 1300-1400 level players when I Fianchetto and that is still my plan. I prefer flank attacks.} d5 3. d4 e6 4. e3 {In hindsight, I think Bg2 may have been better here. I deviated from my initial plan. I'm now a move behind that plan. In addition, my DSB is not happy.} Bd6 5. Bg2 {A little late. I wanted to castle first!} O-O 6. O-O c5 {4. e3 is still not that useful. Seems like I wasted a move and I don't think black will forgive.} 7. Nc3 {Developing minor pieces. I would like to advance my knights quickly here since the center seems so complicated.} Nc6 8. Nb5 Be7 9. Ne5 Nxe5 10. dxe5 {That's ugly. Two pieces unprotected. I think advancing the knight to b5 was premature. I considered Nd6, but that doesn't look very healthy.} Nd7 11. e4 {Trying to free up my DSB, still paying for that e3 move. I thought black would trade pawns.} d4 {Rut Roh, that can't be good.} 12. Nd6 {I reconsidered the knight move. I thought I might get a chance to protect the e5 pawn with my DSB. I should've moved f4.} Nxe5 {So much for that plan.} 13. Nxc8 {I thought a bishop might be worth more than a knight. In hindsight, maybe the other bishop, but black's LSB is not really worth the trade.} Rxc8 14. f4 Nc6 15. Bd2 c4 16. c3 {From here, I made so many errors (beyond what I've already made), I've also decided to stop annotating. Good game.} Qb6 17. Be1 dxc3+ 18. Bf2 Qxb2 19. e5 Rfd8 20. Qb1 Rd2 21. Be4 Rxf2 22. Bxh7+ Kh8 23. Be4 Bc5 24. Qxb2 Rxb2+ 25. Kh1 Rd8 26. Rab1 Rdd2 27. h4 Rdh2# {}
