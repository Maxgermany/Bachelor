1. e4 {White playes e4. I play e4 myself too. The downside of e4 is that it allows black to decide what kind of game it's gonna be. King's pawn game e5, pirc d6 french e6 caro kann c6 sicilian c5 scandinavian d5 and there are even more variations. There are a lot less variations in other openings white can play.} e5 {But I play this move, e5. } 2. Nf3 {Attacks the pawn and develops a piece.} Nc6 {Protects the pawn and develops a piece. d6 is sometimes played but I don't like it becuase it locks the bsb.} 3. Bc4 {This is the italian game and I play it myself too.} Bc5 {Most common reply. Now Nxe5 doesn't work, because of 4Nxe5 Nxe5 5 d4 Nxc4 and white simply lost a piece.} 4. d4 {This is not played a lot, it simply loses a pawn. However because I was not concentrated enough I chose the wrong piece to hit the pawn. } Nxd4 {Taking with either the pawn or the bishop (I prefer the bishop) is much better} 5. Ng5 {But white didn't see he could simply play Nxe5 here which has the same effect as this. A bit of luck on my side.} Ne6 {Nh6 is also possible here but at least it forces white to do something because white's knight is attacked twice and only defended once with the queen.} 6. Bxe6 {White decided to trade his bishop for the knight. } fxe6 {Always capture to the center, and now I have a half open c-file. If I took with the d-pawn then white could have traded queens and I couldn't castle anymore.} 7. O-O {White could have played Qh5 but the threat looks to have no use. 7Qh5+ g6 8Qf3 Nf6.} Nf6 {Develops the knight, prepares castling and stops any annoying queen move.} 8. Nc3 {White develops his knight} O-O {I castle to safety.} 9. Na4 {White moves the same piece twice. Better was to develop the bishop, maybe with fianchetto on b2.} Be7 {I do not want to trade bishops, I think this bishop is best placed here.} 10. Re1 {Better is probably to develop the bishop.} b6 {Looking back I think c6 and then d5 may have been better, but I was afraid it was too slow.} 11. a3 {Apparantly white doesn't like the idea of Bb4} Bb7 {Gives more pressure on the e-pawn. } 12. Nc3 {White moves the same piece twice again to defend the pawn. He didn't like f3 and maybe he has a good reason because white's king is vulnerable.} Ne8 {I now attack white's knight twice and I think d6 is a better square.} 13. Nf3 Bc5 {This move is simply a mistake.} 14. b4 {Now I have to retreat back because on d4 it will lose a pawn and it loses the bishop pair.} Bd6 {Since the lsb is already developped, this seems ok. I might go c5.} 15. Bb2 Ba6 {Improves the bishop a bit, but I think this is also a mistake. Better is probably Rc8 or Qe7 to prepare c5. However this stops Nb5.} 16. Qd2 {White completes the opening phase with connecting his rooks.} h6 {g5 is a very strong square for the knight, so I played this.} 17. Rad1 {White tries to improve his position} Qf6 {?This is really bad, better was probably to go with the c5 plan.} 18. Ne2 {Surprisingly a good move.} Qg6 {This move threats either Rxf3 (gpawn is pinned) or Qxe4. But I think it's not good.} 19. Ng3 {Good move, protects both the knight (the pawn isn't pinned) and the pawn on e4.} Rd8 {?? Another mistake on my part. The only move was to move the queen back to defend e5.} 20. Bxe5 {White takes} Bxe5 {Maybe Be7 is a lot better to keep the bishop pair? This is another mistake I think.} 21. Nxe5 Qg5 {The knights are very powerful, if I move to f6 then 21Nxe5 Qf6 22 Nh5 Qe7 23 Ng6 and I have a problem.} 22. Qxg5 {White does not want to move the knight} hxg5 {Now I have doubled pawns on my kingside.} 23. Rxd7 {White earns another pawn. If I play Nd6 then he could simply win another pawn on c7. Rc8 and he can play Ng6 and after the rook moves white can play Nd7+ to win the rook.} Rxd7 {Im not sure if this is the best move. But I also couldnt find any better one.} 24. Nxd7 {Now if I play Rf4 then white can play Rh5 and it looks horrible for black.} Rf7 25. Ne5 {Now my rook has to move to the retarded square e7} Re7 {This really looks like a lost position for black to me.} 26. c4 {White starts to play bad from here. White should play slow and start to move the knight on g3, then move the pawn. The queenside is OK for black. Nc6 is another option, but if black takes on a7 then the knight could have problems getting to safety. So maybe that is why white played this, so he could retreat to b5.} Nd6 {Attacking the pawn.} 27. c5 Nc4 {If black can trade the knights, black will improve his position.} 28. Nxc4 {White chooses to trade! Maybe Nf3 was much better?} Bxc4 29. cxb6 axb6 {cxb6 is also possible, but I preferred this because white could still make some mistakes and get me a passed pawn.} 30. e5 {White thinks that this is safer for the pawn because its now on a black square and I only have a lsb. White should have played Rd1.} Rd7 {Now I take the open file here.} 31. f3 {White wants to stop any back rank mate so he can move the rook} c6 {This allows me to retreat the bishop back to b5 after Rc1.} 32. Ne4 {Attacking the pawn on g5. The pawn is lost.} Rd3 {Attacking the a-pawn.} 33. Rc1 Bb5 {As planned.} 34. Nxg5 {White is in a winning position. Its a miracle how I still won the game.} Re3 {This move is a lost tempo} 35. f4 {White defends his pawn very easily.} Rxa3 {Taking the pawn.} 36. Nxe6 {White took my pawn and the game looks even better for white.} Rb3 {This is actually another mistake, but white didn't see it. If white plays Nd4 the game is pretty much over for black, because white will create double pawns on the b-file and the rook is standing on a place where the pawn cant promote. } 37. Ra1 {This move is a mistake as discussed in the previous move.} Rxb4 {Taking the pawn and now I at least have passed pawns too.} 38. g3 {Another wasted move in my opinion. White wants to move the knight and doesn't want f4 to fall.} Kf7 {Activating my king with a free tempo.} 39. Ng5+ Kg6 {White has free room to go for promotion. } 40. Re1 {He plays this move first. Maybe this is actually a wasted tempo.} c5 {My pawn moves and now e8 is defended by the bishop!} 41. e6 {White moves the pawn} c4 {But I dont seem to care and move my pawn too!} 42. e7 {This move is actually not good. Black should have played Ne4 probably.} c3 {I push the pawn.} 43. Re6+ {Now black is making some serious mistakes. I can play Kh5, but then white will promote with check. I think Kf5 is better.} Kf5 44. Re5+ {Now he checks me again If I play Kf6 then white could play Nh7 and it would still be check if he promotes.} Kg4 {So I moved here.} 45. Rxb5 {???!! White makes the big blunder! He thinks now he can freely promote to e8 after I take back but the problem is I don't take back but move to c2!} c2 {Now I could force a draw. If he promotes, I promote and check the king endlessly because he can't escape to h3 or f3 (isn't that funny?) He probably saw this too and made the next blunder.} 46. h3+ {A serious blunder. If I play Kh5 ofcourse the game is over for black.} Kxg3 {But I play this move!! Now if I promote, its CHECKMATE. } 47. Ne4+ {This move is pretty much forced.} Rxe4 {Now I take the rook and suddenly now I am winning! Re1# or c1=RorQ# !!} 48. Rb3+ {This move is also forced.} Kxf4 {Not only did I take another free pawn, but I'm now up in material!} 49. Rc3 {Here another club player said later that I made a mistake. He thought I could play Re1 and go for mate but I think he is wrong, the result would have been the same.} Rxe7 50. Rxc2 {And so we trade pawns but Im now in the winning position and I finish it.} b5 51. Kg2 Rb7 {This move defends both pawns and white will lose this. But he played on, and I will show you what happened.} 52. Rf2+ Ke3 53. Rf3+ Ke4 {Now he can't check me.} 54. Kg3 b4 55. Rb3 {White saw that giving checks does not help.} Kd4 {Moving the king into the action.} 56. Kf3 Kc4 57. Rb1 Kc3 {Pushing the rook off the b file.} 58. Ke3 Kc2 59. Ra1 b3 60. Rg1 b2 61. Rg2+ Kb1 {Kb3 was probably the same.} 62. Rg1+ Ka2 63. Rg2 Ka3 {Now he resigned. If he played Rg3 I had the nasty Rb3+ which won the game the fastest. This proves that having a pawn more in a rook endgame is a winning position. If you have any comments, feel free to do so!}
