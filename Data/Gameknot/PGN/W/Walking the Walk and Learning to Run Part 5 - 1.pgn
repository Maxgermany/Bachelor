1. a4 e5 2. a5 d5 3. e3 f5 4. a6 {Thematic tournament begins from this position} Nxa6 {Black takes the gambit pawn.} 5. d4 e4 {Black tries to lock in the center} 6. Nh3 {White develops looking for weaknesses.} c6 {Black wants to bring the N back from the rim.} 7. Nf4 Nf6 {Otherwise Qh5+} 8. c4 {White begins the counterattack against the center.} Nc7 {Black plans on bringing the N back into play.} 9. Nh5 {This exchange tries to weaken Black's K position.} g6 {Black puts the question to the N.} 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Qb3 {Similar to a French Defense reversed, white puts pressure on d5 and b7.} Be6 {?? This is a losing blunder. I forgot about the threat to b7.} 12. Qxb7 {Of course, Black must protect the N but how?} Kd7 {Hoping for some variation where Black can trap the Q at b7,} 13. Nc3 Bd6 {With the idea of Rb8, } 14. Ra6 {!! However this is fatal. Not only does Rb8 fail to Qxc6+ but there is no way of defending c6. Black must lose material and his king position will be a chronic problem. Given my opponents rating resignation was in order.}
