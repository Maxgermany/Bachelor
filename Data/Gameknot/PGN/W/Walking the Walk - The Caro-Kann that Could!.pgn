[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance variation"]

1. e4 {Here is a game from the "Walking the Walk" club. The idea is that the wannabies (like myself) issue a challenge to one of the masters. After "talking the talk" it is then time to walk the walk. The Wannabe is to annotate the game on completion. I'm going to annotate this game along the way, to ensure a I represent my thoughts correctly, rather than with a retrospective eye.} c6 {Caro-Kann. This is what was expected as I suggested to Shamash that I was going to turn his Caro-Khan into a Caro-Can't. Seems a little bit like threatening to stab a T-rex with a plastic fork. } 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {The advance variation. I have almost no experience with the Caro-Kann, and the small amount of study I was able to put in before the game suggested that this variation doesn't require as much theory to back it up as 3.Nc3 I wouldn't play the exchange variation (3.exd5) as it seems to give black a much easier game. I also noted that Shamash (who is yet to be beaten on this site) has drawn more games of this flavour than the rest. } c5 {I'm not familiar enough with the theory really, but to my untrained eye I would suggest that the idea behind this move is Black offering a pawn in order to draw White into an overextended position. My crash course in Caro-Kann informs me that this defence leads toward long games where it can all come down to the integrity of pawn structures. } 4. dxc5 e6 {White now must try to defend his advanced pawns. A big drawback to White's pawns is that there are squares in the centre that they can no longer exert control over. } 5. Be3 {Looking to place the bishop at d4. } Nh6 {Developing. Perhaps looking for Nf5 challenging the bishop when it gets to d4. } 6. Bd4 Nf5 7. c3 {At this point the game looks to be fairly even. White may even retain an edge? What I notice about this position is that White seems to have more options for quickly developing pieces. } Bd7 8. Nf3 {I continue to develop.} Nc6 9. Qd2 {Trying to exert more influence on the kingside squares. Black is unlikely to exchange his knight for a "bad" bishop and allow White to take away the pawn weakness. At this point I am thinking about b4, trying to gain more space and to put the squeeze on black. } f6 {Challenging e5. I can see two reasons for this. Firstly, Black wants to improve his light square bishop. It is currently locked into a relatively useless diagonal. Secondly (and perhaps more importantly), this move is a bid to regain the pawn that was given up and to agressively place his dark square bishop by 10...fxe5 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bxe5 Bxc5. The resulting position is probably ok for White, but doesn't fit in with the strategy I am trying to implement - basically to make it difficult for black to develop his pieces onto good squares, and to cramp his position. } 10. b4 {I played this move to avoid the previously mentioned line, and to keep the material advantage for a little longer. Ideas for white may be to follow up with a4, gaining more space and making any Queenside action for black more difficult. An opprtunity may even present itself to exchange with blacks b pawn to create a passed d pawn. A bit of a pipe-dream perhaps! I am expecting Black to respond something like 10...fxe5 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bxe5 - at least that is what I might consider as black - exchanging pieces to free up a cramped position. } a5 {I think Black is looking to exchange at b4, in order to take away a defender of d4. 11.a3 doesn't prevent anything (PxP, PxP, RxR), and 11.bxa5 looks like positional suicide, bringing the black rook into the game and creating isolated, doubled pawns. 11.b5 seems a good way to proceed, forcing Black to either retreat the knight or exchange with White's "bad" bishop.} 11. exf6 {However, I figured that my plan would still be valid next move, so I chose to hit Black's pawn structure first. Black must either recapture with gxf, or try to mix it up with something like: 11...axb4, but after 12.fxg7 Nxg7 13.Bxg7 Bxg7 14.Be2 black looks quite scattered. Otherwise 11...Ncxd4 12.cxd4 gxf6 13.b5 } gxf6 12. b5 Ncxd4 13. cxd4 {At this point, it's looking ok for White. I seem to be more or less keeping up with development, and seem to have a space advantage. The material advantage is an illusion though. I can't see how white can defend d4 after 14...e5 } e5 {The threat to d4 isn't in itself doesn't look all that dangerous. Exchanges on d4 seem to favour White - Black would have a difficult task on his hands trying to defend all of those isolated pawns. There would be a passed pawn of course, but I don't think that is enough for Black. However, If white doesn't exchange on e5 then Black can play 14...e4 gaining space and forcing the White knight to retreat back to g1. I cannot immediately see any reason why not to take on e5, but I'm sure Shamash wouldn't give me an extra pawn for nothing...} 14. dxe5 {It took me a long time to make this move. The obvious responses for Black are 14...fxe5, which seems very bland, and doesn't achieve anything, or maybe 14...Bxc5 which could bring about some complexities, including a bishop sacrifice on f2. I don't think the sac is sound (at least for now). after something like: 14...Bxc5 15.Qxd5 Bxf2+ 16.Kxf2 Qb6+ 17.Ke1, it looks fine, but definitely worth keeping in mind.    } Bxc5 {I now think that it is a bad idea to take the pawn at d5. after 15.Qxd5 Qb6 the f6 pawn will fall and the White king will be exposed (the White Queen can't come back to d1 because of Bb4). It seems that 15.Nc3 or 15.Bd3 are safer. After 15.Nc3 Qb6 16.Nd1 Bxb5 17.Bxb5 Qxb5 Black has regained the material and has a very aggressive position. After 15.Bd3 Qb6 White can castle into safety. } 15. Bd3 Bb4 {Unfortunately shamash had a better idea. Not sure why I didn't consider this move - I noticed it when investigating another line. } 16. Nc3 {Forced - White cannot avoid losing material here. Black will almost certainly respond with d4 and at least one of the White knights will be out of the race. } d4 {As expected, although before making the move Shamash revealed through a comment "the issue is whether to go for a little material right away, or to ramp up the pressure" } 17. Nxd4 {Forced - otherwise 17...Bxc3 and the White queen will have to watch the rest of the game from the sideline. } Nxd4 {Unfortunately I fell behind in my annotation here so the rest is retrospective. Sometimes chess must move aside for more important things! Anyhow, this is a strong place to post a knight. it will be difficult to dislodge and exerts pressure on the White King's position. } 18. Rc1 {Giving the rook some influence on the c-file. Also defending the pinned knight. } Bxb5 19. O-O {If instead 19. Bxb5 then ...Nf3+ and the White Queen is lost. There were some comments around this time (which sadly aren't available to me anymore) about the notion of a knight sacrifice on f3, and how awkward it could make Whites game with an open g-file. } Nf3+ 20. gxf3 {The Rook at h8 now looks destined to create havoc for White. Also notice how difficult it is for the White pieces to plug the gaps in the kings position. } Qxd3 {I had missed this at the time, essentially making the sacrifice of the knight only a brief handover of material. The Queen exchange is unavoidable due ...Rg8+, with unavoidable mate. 21. Qf4 doesn't help due to ...Bxc3} 21. Qxd3 Bxd3 {The noose seems to have loosened off slightly for White, but against such strong opposition finding any counterplay will likely be almost impossible. } 22. Rfe1 {Stepping out of the Black Bishop's way and defending the e5 pawn. I was dreaming of ways to try to create a passed pawn to make life a little less comfortable for Black. The down side of this move is that Nd5 is no longer a good option due to a self inflicted pin. } Rg8+ 23. Kh1 {Was bound to come sooner or later!} Rd8 {Bringing the last piece into the action. Shamash commented here that he had 4 sound moves to choose from - a tribute to the mobility he has created for his pieces. } 24. exf6+ {There is the passed pawn. Unfortunately it is inable to be supported effectively. This does remove all pawn protection from the Black King. It has become apparent that this is not going to be one of those Caro Kann games where the sounder pawn structure wins!} Kf7 25. Ne4 {Offering a rook to gain the initiative and hopefully find some counterplay somewhere. } Bxe1 26. Rc7+ {Trying to create some chances for the pawn, and looking for ways to coordinate the knight into a last ditch effort. } Kf8 27. f7 {Inching closer to the 8th rank, and making room for the knight at f6, dreaming of a last minute swindle that might begin with something liike 29. Nxh7+, Kg7 30. f8=Q+} Rg6 {But it isn't to be. The game was lost for White a long time ago, but now the writing really is on the wall. } 28. h3 Bxe4 29. fxe4 Bxf2 30. Rc1 {The rest of the game is just trying to survive as many moves as possible. } Be3 31. Rf1 Rd2 32. e5 Rgg2 33. Rf2 Rgxf2 34. e6 Rf1# {And there it is. Thanks for a really instructive game shamash. I hope other readers can gain something from this game too. All comments welcome}
