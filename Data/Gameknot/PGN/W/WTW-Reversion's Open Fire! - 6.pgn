1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Wanting to learn by trying something different, I play the Philidor's Defense.  I like to try different things that I haven't done before since for me, I'm used to responding after the Ruy Lopez.  What I like about the defense is that it doesn't just start off with a conventional opening, but this also enables me to open up a diagonol for my Bc8.  The idea is center control.  That was based on some games that I've studied in elyhim's past annotations since he mentioned things similar like controlling the center right in the beginning.  I should point out that this game happened before Terence's most recent annotation, but that was also mentioned.  And, he implied that having the center controlled first and leaving it that way, is generally, how a game develops.} 3. d4 {As anticipated, so I exchange.  But, when playing 2...d6, this entire line came into calculation, and the plan behind exchanging is, as noted, development.} exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 c5 {Meanwhile, I attack, to hinder his development.  But, I overlooked his next move.  } 6. Bb5+ Bd7 {This way I can castle, and another reason behind here is to exchange.  However, I learned that this plan is problematic when tactical-abyss talked about Knights being worth more then bishops in 1.d4 openings because they're closed positions.  But, 1.e4 is open, so I wound up losing an exchange.  It's not always the case, but usually, we need the bishop when the position is open, like this.} 7. Bxd7+ Nbxd7 8. Nf5 {Which he takes advantage of to develop.} Qc7 {One wouldn't think so, but the harsh reality is that, my d6 was under attack, and therefore, needed protection.  I originally thought that 9.Nxd6 isn't so bad because black could answer with 9...Bxd6, but what it boils down to is his Queen, which is why I need that extra defender.} 9. O-O {Meanwhile, he castles.} g6 {?? But, I was too hyperfocused on finding a good outpost for my Bishop and castling short.  Much better, however, was 9...0-0-0, at once.  Now, I wind up in a lot of trouble, and he takes away my castling rights.  In doing so, my monarch will wind up under siege with a very small chance to save the position.  But, castling on the opposite wing would've taken care of the problem, as this will enable him to win material.  And, by not castling, my monarch will wind up exposed.  So, this turns out to be a serious blunder.  Instead, the focus needed to be on what was happening, and what to do in that situation.  By failing to castle, I've set myself up for disaster.} 10. Nb5 {And, it starts with this move, for after I retreat, he wins material and my monarch is badly exposed which will allow his attacking pieces to swarm right in.} Qc6 11. Nfxd6+ Bxd6 12. Nxd6+ Ke7 13. Bf4 {Continuing with his development.  But, I'm also pretty sure that he's taking advantage of my exposed King.  I'm just not sure how.} Nxe4 {?? At first, I thought I was safe which was the reason behind this move.  This, however, was a time where I did not think it through due to overlooking his next move.  What happened was perceptual illusion because I forgot about his Nd6.  Now, that I think of it, this is similar to my second game against Tim because this blunder occured a day or two prior to me postponing my games.  Like that game, I was terribly distracted due to planning ahead for the vacation.  In this case, I was thinking about how to prevent fatigue while on the plan in order to study a Susan Polgar, as opposed to, focusing on the game.  This is the second game that resulted in a costly error and prevent me from doing my Homework.  In doing so, any chances of saving the game are now over.  In fact, this position is resignable, but my reason for staying in is to follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk rules which states that we don't resign until mate can be forced.} 14. Nxe4 Rhc8 {Knowing that it can't get worse, I follow one rule of thumb.  That it's generally a good idea to have the Rook behind the Queen.  You'll note, that things were crazy, and this move happened very shortly after coming back from vacation.} 15. Bd6+ {Taking advantage of my weakened King, as noted earlier.} Kd8 16. Ng5 {Preparing for a mating net.  So, I'll do what I can to hold it off.  How I figured out that it's lost is me being in worse trouble then one could imagine.  He will prepare his Queen and one of his Rooks.  When this happens, mate will soon to be followed because there's the Knight and the DSB.  As I know, when two or more attacking pieces work together, it often spells disaster, and this is no exception.  } Nf6 {Trying to confuse him, which I no doesn't work.  But, the strategy is the same as what redfoxrising used against me without luck.  So, all I can do is hope that he goes wrong which would enable counterplay.  My chances are zero, but the idea is seeing how long you last, which is part of why the WTW rules are not resigning until you see a forced mate.} 17. Qe2 {The move that I anticipated.} Qd7 {So, I try to block the mate.} 18. Rad1 {But, as I know, he had ways to prevent.  In other words, I knew that he would play because of what's soon to follow.} Qe8 {This was in my game notes since that's part of my Homework which didn't start, until recently.  But, I got ideas from bhidragon and kenneth_fiore_3 since moves had to be discussed before playing them.  And, I also remember being given Homework, so this dates back as it's based on what went through my mind (the thought process) before each move was played.  What I have is, This was very difficult for me to access. But, if I take the bishop, he gets a pawn and my Queen for Knight, after 18.Nxf7 But, if I don't do something, he mates with 18.Qe7# Therefore, 17...Qd7 is forced. If I don't move my Queen, it gets pinned. But, if I go anywherelse, aside from e8, he mates with 19.Qe2#. So, my only option is 18...Qe8.} 19. Bg3+ Nd7 {Forced, and now, the Knight is tied down.  If this weren't the only move, I would've gotten out with the monarch because a pin like this is very serious.  But, there's nothing I can do about it.  And, as we know, he'll force mate starting with the next move.} 20. Rfe1 {At first, I thought that this was played to protect his Queen, but there's more to the story then meets the eye.  That's because, as the story reveals, he'll force mate.  In fact, the reason for my next move isn't just for exchanging Queens.  But, having said that, I would've captured on e2, anyhow.  However, the idea was to, if possible, prevent mate since the immediate threat was 21.Qxe8#.} Qxe2 21. Rxe2 {But, it cannot.  I analyzed the board and asked myself what could be done to prevent.  The answers is nothing because of 22.Nxf7+, Kc8 (forced) 23.Re8# which is mate.  So, I resigned here.  What's important is to see how the game is developing and what must be done.  This is another example, of where I overlooked his attacking forces against my monarch and paid the ultimate price.  This wouldn't have happened, if I had castled with 10...0-0-0, as he would not have had any forces to attack my monarch, as quickly.  So, the real moral as it were in my game with bhidragon is to figure out the entire story that the board is revealing which is still a weakness for me.  And, that's why I feel that getting out of my comfort zone is vital to becoming a better player.}
