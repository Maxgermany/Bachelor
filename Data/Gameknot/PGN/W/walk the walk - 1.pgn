1. e4 {Walk the Walk game....I decided to play an open game to play it safe} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Qe7 5. O-O Nf6 6. d4 Bb6 7. Re1 O-O 8. Bg5 {Not a very strong move as Janet (BC) commented} h6 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. d5 Ne7 11. a4 {Now that my king is safe my plan is to set-up a strong pawn chain} Ng6 12. a5 Bc5 13. b4 {Strong enough i guess..} Be7 14. Nbd2 {I wanted to connect my rooks but I missed out on black's next strong move} Nf4 {By giving her knight a foothold she is able to attack my kingside (as you can see on the succeeding moves)} 15. a6 {I figured there is no way she will capture the pawn and risk a queenside attack. So i went ahead and pushed forward} b6 16. g3 Nh3+ {A stronghold for her knight....} 17. Kg2 d6 18. Qa4 {Clearly my King is already under attack. I could worry about defending or initiating my own counter-attack. I opted for the latter} Bg4 19. Be2 h5 20. Qc6 Rfc8 {For now my Queen outpost renders two of her rooks immobile...Very much needed to stall her attack} 21. Ref1 Qg6 22. Kh1 Rab8 {black is  planning b5 then Rb6 to drive away my Queen} 23. b5 {...but by this time I already have a stonewall pawn chain} Qh6 24. Ra2 h4 25. Nd4 {Finally forcing her to exchange to relieve myself of the pressure} Bxe2 26. Nxe2 hxg3 27. fxg3 Qe3 {There appears to be a pin if I moved Qd7. However, after her Nf2+ it would have been a massacre for my pawns.} 28. Qc4 Nf2+ 29. Kg2 Ng4 {...and Janet offers a draw} 30. Rf3 {But Im not quite satisfied yet} Qh6 31. Nf1 Qh7 32. Nc1 {Next plan is to move my knight to c6...that way I'll swap the role of my Queen with my knight in immobilising her rooks and fully utilizing my Queen for the attack} Bg5 33. Nd3 Qg6 34. Nb4 Rba8 35. h3 Nf6 36. Rf5 Rcd8 {Another offer of Janet to capture her c7 pawn. But I think with great repercussions} 37. Nc6 Rde8 38. Raf2 Kh7 39. Qd3 Kh8 40. Qf3 Kg8 41. c4 Kh7 42. Qd3 Kg8 43. Qf3 Kh7 {At this point I was thinking if I moved my Knight to h2 then g4 provoking an exchange of Knights and Queens I would be left with two rooks and a knight against her two rooks and bishop. My knight immobilising her two rooks yet my two rooks being unable to penetrate her f and g pawns because of her bishop stationed at h6..} 44. Qd3 {Hoping for Janet to move her Bishop and initiate an exchange with my knight vs. her bishop} Kg8 {Neither of us would budge} 45. Qf3 Kh7 {...fin (please feel free to comment)}
