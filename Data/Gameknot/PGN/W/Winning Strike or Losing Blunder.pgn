[Black "rickdaily12 (1570)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B22), 2.c3, Heidenfeld variation"]

1. e4 {The most common first move. I exclusively play e4 as White if I'm serious about the game.} c5 {Likewise, I've really grown to appreciate the Sicilian. For similar reasons, I suppose. I can be a little fluid in my first 3 moves as White after e4; and this is usually the case when I do Sicilian as well.} 2. c3 {I encounter this line less often. This move inhibits Nc3 outright, allowing Black to seize d5-e4 easier.} Nf6 {Likewise, the usual reply. But not unprepared for...} 3. e5 {A knight chase. Usually this would be poor on Black's part, but White's back rank remains untouched.} Nd5 {If Bc4, then the chase is reversed after Nb6. If c4, d4 becomes less safe for White and e5 is compromised.} 4. d4 {This is the main line as it is anyhow. White tries to displace the Sicilian with a solid pawn phalanx.} cxd4 {Black has hardly any reason to refuse.} 5. cxd4 {Now e5 is protected, but hard to maintain due to none of White's stronger pieces being in play yet.} d6 {Inviting exchange, and also opens the LSB, further deterring 6. e6!} 6. Nf3 {Finally!} Nc6 {Continuing development.} 7. Bd3 {Also not usually seen. Usually better are Bc4, Be2, or even a3, thusly preventing...} Ndb4 {Now the knights are joined and bullying White's queen-side.} 8. Bb5 {White is clearly responding to Black now. Seeming to go for a more aggressive path, aiming to pin down one of the knights instead of diverting the bishop to c4 or e2 as earlier noted.} Qa5 {A bit more aggressive as well, but at this point I didn't feel as though losing the knight to a bishop exchange on c6 should concern Black anymore, not with the c pawn gone. Now White needs to seriously consider how to handle the bishop while paying extremely close attention to 9... Nc2+!!} 9. Nc3 {Practically forced? This is the only move that addresses both above issues.} Bf5 {I didn't see how Black benefits from a6, nor did I see exchange as a real threat. I did see this move causing some serious harm to White's queenside, but I overlooked one saving move: O-O! Once played, all my pins and pressures against White effectively end on the spot...!} 10. Ba4 {-but they didn't seem to spot that one either! Worse, after that, Nd3+ becomes perfectly possible...} b5 {First, I decide to bully the bishop even further.} 11. Bb3 {Again, practically forced... or is it?} dxe5 {Next, I noticed that the central pawn pair becomes unstable and weak now that Rd8 is playable...} 12. dxe5 {If d5 instead, I still have Rd8. Might as well make the material equal... but this was ultimately White's final chance to castle... gone.} Nd3+ {Only way to maintain Castling privileges is by sacrificing the queen...! } 13. Kf1 {-and now the kingside rook is out of the game!} Rd8 {Black just simply has the tempo/space advantage, as well as development, to continue threatening all sorts of discovered checks against White. My opponent is in for a seriously uphill battle.} 14. Nd5 {I understand why, but it was a little too soon, I think. First should have been Bd2, especially if the knight can by chased away. Not only is the knight going to not be an obstacle for very long, but a bishop on d2 would threaten my queen instead of allowing...} e6 {Now the discovered attack on the queen is going to be stronger.} 15. Ne3 {Trying to drive away the powerful bishop, but I don't need it for now. White still has a way out of this...} Ndxe5 {If Nxf2, Qxd8+, Qxd8, Kxf2 and the position isn't as strong as it could be. Plus, White's own knight pair is a little too strong not to stress out at the moment.} 16. Qe2 {No! Moving the queen -at all- was the trap! Bd2, Bb4, Qc1 would have saved the queen and prolonged the life of White's King. To quote my opponent, after my next move, they were instantly sorry for playing this, saying "I tried for so long trying to avoid exactly that!" Indeed!} Bd3 {And there you have it. The White Queen has now fallen, and White resigns here. But surely this wasn't inevitable? What was the cause of this result? Did Black simply have too much tempo, or did White make a game-losing blunder even before the queen drop? What do you think, my wise reader?}
