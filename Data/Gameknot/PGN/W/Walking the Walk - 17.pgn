[Opening "French (C00), Chigorin variation"]

1. e4 {Play lines you know best, while I've dabbled with other openings, 1.e4 is certainly the one I play most often and am most comfortable with. Computer analysis here http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16424431&rnd=0.01421505631878972} e6 {Starting the sequence for a possible French, an opening I hate playing against and score very low against.} 2. Qe2 {While I do not exactly heed my own advice playing (I've never played this line either OTB or online) I am aiming for more comfortable positions. I've experiment with many different responses to the French, none of which I've been very successful with; sometimes here I'll play 2. b3, a gambit line, or just stick to traditional classical or tarrasch lines. The Chigorin defense has almost 2,000 games in the world database (compared to 90,000 with the book d4), it discourages the typical 2...d5 from black in the french since after the pawn exchange black's e-pawn is pinned and he must capture with the queen. Black's typical response is 2...c5 after which the games resemble closed sicilian positions, a board position that I would be much more comfortable in, typically avoiding open sicilians when I play 1.e4} c6 {My opponent however does not go for typical play, c6 supports the d5 push as black would not forced to re-capture with the queen. This does hinder the queen-side development though, and indeed black does not develop these pieces until move 14 with Ra7! The pieces are perfectly at home on these squares for almost the entirety of the game. } 3. d4 {Since ...c6 is so unusual there are only 4 games with it played, White won with d4 but I know I'm mostly on my own here. I open lines to develop my bishop and try to stake my claim in the center. } d5 4. Nc3 Bb4 {And now we have an early deviation from the database which continued 4...de4 5. Qe4 Nf6 6. Qh4. With the text move e4 loses a defender and d5 loses an attacker. } 5. Nf3 {I decided that I would continue developing, e4 was still protected by the queen but if de4 Qe4 Nf6 came to pass I wanted a defender on d4. Little did I realize that white needs to heed black already. } Nf6 6. Bg5 {My first real mistake, I didn't want to play 6. e5 Ne4 or any other line which would allow Black that nice home for his knight so I thought I was all set however I missed...} dxe4 {Queen takes turns ugly for white real fast after 7. Qe4 Ne4 8.Bd8 Nc3 and of course my knight is still pinned. There are few places the f6 knight can go} 7. Nd2 {I decided to at least remove the pin on my knight.} Qxd4 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Ndxe4 Qh6 {I've scrapped by and managed to only lose a pawn, my structure is still intact on the queenside which was a worry, but I need to develop my bishop and castle. I was hoping the development of Black's queen and the under-development of his minor pieces would gain me some tempo but that is not the case. } 10. Qc4 {Threatening the bishop and making way to develop} a5 11. Be2 b5 12. Qd3 O-O 13. O-O {I feel slightly cramped already, my knights need room to move and the bishop does not have much scope, but I'm only a pawn down still...} f5 14. Ng3 Ra7 15. a3 Bc5 16. Bf3 {The one move in this sequence I'm happy with, glad that black "allowed" me to get this in, I don't realize that he's very efficiently hampering all my other pieces} Rd7 17. Qe2 Rd2 18. Qe5 Bd6 19. Qe3 Qxe3 20. fxe3 Rxc2 {And now I've lost a second pawn with little hope of getting either back while my structure is collapsing by the move.} 21. Rab1 {Having few, if any, counter threats I must try to defend my hanging pawns now. } b4 22. axb4 axb4 23. Nce2 {Aiming for d4, but little do I realize that I've effectively trapped my bishop.} e5 24. Rfd1 Bc5 25. Nf1 e4 26. Bxe4 fxe4 27. Nd4 Bxd4 28. Rxd4 c5 {The black knight and bishop are still undeveloped, but they do plenty of work. } 29. Rd2 {Loses the exchange, I could capture on e4 due to Bb7. } Rxf1+ 30. Kxf1 Rxd2 31. Rc1 Na6 32. h3 Bd7 33. Rc4 {The final mistake, walking right into a pin.} Bb5 34. b3 {My opponent here said that he had expected Ke1 and a rook exchange, a point I missed but hardly saving anything. Waiting for the final blow now. } Bxc4+ 35. bxc4 b3 {Although I will get something from the match, somewhere here my opponent declared a mate in 4 and I was able to outsmart him and last a little longer! } 36. Kg1 b2 37. Kh2 b1=Q 38. Kg3 Qf1 39. Kh4 Rxg2 40. Kh5 g6+ 41. Kh6 Qf8# {Slowly my games are getting longer against the masters, perhaps eventually I'll even get a decent middlegame. }
