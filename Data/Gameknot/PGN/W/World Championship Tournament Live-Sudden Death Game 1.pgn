1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4 O-O 5. Nge2 c6 6. Bg2 a6 7. O-O b5 8. d4 d6 {Susan starts here with, "White is about to temporarily sacrificing a pawn to weaken Black's pawn structure. I like Carlsen's position, easy to play."} 9. a3 Bxc3 10. Nxc3 bxc4 11. dxe5 dxe5 12. Na4 {White is down a pawn. But Black has very weak c4 and c6 pawns. Very nice position for white. Very little risk, pressure on black. Carlsen's rapid rating is 2880! Caruana's rapid rating is 2789! I show the ratings, you decide who is the favorite! } Be6 13. Qxd8 Rxd8 14. Be3 Nbd7 {Black is up a pawn. White has a Bishop pair, better piece placement. White is slightly better. } 15. f3 Rab8 16. Rac1 Rb3 {The idea of f3 is simple. He wants to protect the e4 pawn so eventually the Bishop can get back to f1 to go after the c4 pawn first, then c6 pawn. Black needs to get active before white can pound on the weaknesses. Carlsen's plan is quite obvious and deliberate. He has his targets in the c file with Caruana's weak pawns of c4 & c6. It is up to Caruana to find a plan to either distract or defend. This is an ideal position for Rapid Chess for Carlsen! The one who will score 1st has big edge! I really dislike Caruana's position. I will venture a big risk by predicting a Carlsen's win in game 1 of the rapid! Am I crazy? Maybe! But structurally, white's position is simply too strong and black has no real plan to stop it.} 17. Rfe1 Ne8 18. Bf1 Nd6 19. Rcd1 {17. Rfe1 Ne8 18. Bf1 Nd6 19. Rcd1 Black has too many weaknesses: c4 pawn, c6 pawn, c file, d file, poor piece placement, etc. This should be close to winning for Carlsen! That is my 1st game prediction! } Nb5 20. Nc5 Rxb2 21. Nxe6 fxe6 22. Bxc4 Nd4 23. Bxd4 exd4 {As I said right at the start, this type of position is ideal for Rapid chess, especially for Carlsen! It is difficult for Black to defend too many weaknesses! Good opening choice for White! If Carlsen wins this 1st Rapid game, he will be on a roll! But if somehow he screws up and Caruana manage to hold, the momentum will shift BIG time! Self confidence and positive mental attitude are crucial, especially in short time control! There is one big trick left! 24. Rxd4 Kf7 25. Kh1 is a must because of the Ne5 threat! If Carlsen finds it, it is over! } 24. Bxe6+ Kf8 25. Rxd4 Ke7 26. Rxd7+ Rxd7 27. Bxd7 Kxd7 {Carlsen just like in Classical chess, simply lost his ability or patience to calculate deeply. He chose the "safest" way but much more difficult to win. This is now still much better for Carlsen but far from winning. } 28. Rd1+ Ke6 29. f4 {I really do not know if he lost his nerves, patience, ability to calculate, or if the soccer injury has some effect, but this is NOT the Carlsen of past World Championships! Something is very strange! He is missing a lot of things and playing too cautiously!} c5 30. Rd5 Rc2 31. h4 {Caruana should be able to hold now. Very hard to win, especially with such little time! It is INEXPLICABLE how Carlsen chose to walk into this endgame when Caruana was so helpless with his position! Inexplicable!} c4 32. f5+ Kf6 33. Rc5 h5 34. Kf1 {This is now pretty much a draw! Great start! Great opening choice! Terrible decision making after reaching a huge advantage! What disappointment! } Rc3 35. Kg2 Rxa3 36. Rxc4 Ke5 37. Rc7 Kxe4 38. Re7+ Kxf5 39. Rxg7 Kf6 40. Rg5 a5 41. Rxh5 a4 42. Ra5 Ra1 {Ooops! Caruana made some inaccuracies! It will be about nerves now with so little time left! I expect many more mistakes from both players! } 43. Kf3 a3 44. Ra6+ Kg7 45. Kg2 Ra2+ 46. Kh3 Ra1 47. h5 Kh7 48. g4 Kg7 49. Kh4 {Caruana returned the favor. Ooops! Where is the Dvoretsky Endgame Manual? Now Carlsen is close to closing out game 1! This one hurts! Stunning turn of event! This is what you get in fast time control! Carlsen had huge advantage, decided to return the favor & allowed Caruana back in the game. Then Caruana returned the gift! Carlsen won game 1! This is a big emotional boost for Carlsen & heart break for Caruana!} a2 50. Kg5 Kf7 51. h6 Rb1 52. Ra7+ Kg8 53. Rxa2 Rb5+ 54. Kg6 Rb6+ 55. Kh5 {Stunning turn of event! This is what you get in fast time control! Carlsen had huge advantage, decided to return the favor & allowed Caruana back in the game. Then Caruana returned the gift! Carlsen won game 1! This is a big emotional boost for Carlsen & heart break for Caruana! This was the moment of truth! Carlsen let Caruana back in the game! I would recommend all of you to study this position! This is a draw. Analyze it! It will help you in the long run. When the King in stuck in the 1st rank, do not help it by letting it out! }
