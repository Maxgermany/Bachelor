1. e4 e5 2. f4 {Joe: As you said with a different game, I figured I'd try something different. That's especially because I told elyhim that I had no idea how to handle the KG when I annotated a game from tactical-abyss. Therefore, I have a feeling that he'll play this against me in which case, I needed to start preparing now.  reversion: For blitz/bullet, yes it's hard to handle because of it's complications. But it's easier to do it here in correspondence. For more info, you can look at the games of izscha2014 in this mini-tournament and the one he played against albertwall and myself.  Joe:  I did not find any from his game against you. But, I found one from albertwall, and that was interesting.  reversion:  I meant the current one I'm playing against him, i.e, game. But his win over fenek was quite impressive, i.e, game; worth annotating. } exf4 {Not surprisingly, reversion, accepts.} 3. d3 {? But after the game, we discussed it and reversion told me that this is how I end up in rough shape.  In it, he said, "3.d3 was already an error, since it doesn't stops Black's ...Qh4+ idea(Which is prevented by the mainline 3.Nf3), and also blocking in your LSB, which usually goes to c4 pointing out at the critical f7-square."  } Qh4+ {At this point, I figured that I'm in trouble, as it's due to my last blunder, as we saw.  But, it's worse then I expected.} 4. g3 {?? The losing blunder.  I thought that this was the only move to save my position, as moving the monarch takes away castling rights.  What I didn't realize is that I was, once again, focusing on the chess bits and wisdom (chess quotes,) which was not my intention, at all.  Instead, my plan was to try thinking about what the board was telling me (the overall picture).  But, this doesn't do that, however.  I wanted to get out of check with an attack and castle as I felt that if moving my monarch to d2 or e1 would allow an inevitable Kingside attack, similar to what I saw with bhidragon.  However, that wouldn't have happened, for had I used my Ke1, instead, I'd still be safe, for a while longer.  That's the actual story here.   } fxg3 {After my last move, I had anticipated this.  As now, I was starting to think about how to protect the Rook.  I thought there was only way to save the position, but it doesn't as I opened myself for disaster, already.} 5. hxg3 {I thought I'd gotten out of trouble here.  The idea is that if I got out of check with my monarch, he'd play 5...g2+, with a nasty fork.  And, due to the discovered check, not only does he get my Rook, but reversion would Queen, at which, I'd be dead.  But, I overlooked his next move, forgetting that my Rh1 is en-prise.} Qxh1 {After getting my Rook, I resigned.  Against anyonelse, except for Jack Stockel or reversion, I don't resign this early.  In addition to this, I'd, at the least, have to also lose my Queen before resignation would even come into consideration.  And, in a regular WTW game, that won't even be enough.  Instead, the runner must have a proven mating sequence as I generally follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules.  But, reversion have and I have an agreement which ION thinks is a good.  That, one should resign when you lose material like this as there's nothing else to learn.  Although less then 10 moves, it absolutely rings a bell with me.  It actually proves that one should stick to mainlines, afterall.  Simply because, as my opponent notes, had I done this and not blocked my Bishop, he wouldn't have been able to check me and it's with the same move we see in the Damiano's Defense.  Second, but more importantly, seeing that I did it again; this is where if the position becomes more demanding the general chess facts, or as you call it, chess quotes or wisdom, saving the position takes precedence.}
