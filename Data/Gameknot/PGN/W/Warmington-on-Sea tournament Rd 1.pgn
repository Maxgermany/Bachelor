1. d4 {The is based on a real game I played with white. Aside from that, virtually all the details have been changed for the story. The game is notable for how long it is. What is the longest game you have ever played dear reader?} Nf6 {Where do you go for your holidays? I love going to Warmington-on-Sea chess tournaments. We play a move a day. 9am start. We have two hours each on our chess clocks, for 48 moves each. If it is not finished, we get 2 more hours each, adjourn for lunch and then play to a finish after lunch. I was amused to find myself drawn against a certain Span-ki-Moon. I was even more surprised when I met my opponent. She stood about 5’ 7” tall with jet black hair all the way down her back, with big brown eyes and skin so golden it seemed like a tan. When she smiled she had the most perfect teeth and lips I ever seen. She was dressed in the tightest blue jeans you could picture and a tee shirt that was skin tight. She was lovely!} 2. c4 {"Are you related to Ban Ki-moon I asked?" half joking. "No, he's from South Korea and I am from Thailand" she replied. "Bangkok?" I asked her. "No, I'm not kind of girl" she smiled in reply. We exchanged a hand shake. Her hands were small and dainty and beautifully manicured. They felt soft and inviting. We held hands for just a moment longer than normal. It went through my mind how nice it would be to walk with her, holding that hand. I was a bit entranced by her, as we rattled the first few moves.} c5 {Aha! Entering the Benoni-Benko complex of openings.} 3. d5 {It was slightly off-putting playing her. The strong smell of her sweet perfume. This beautifully manicured hands reaching over the board.....} d6 {This move is probably necessary to prevent white from playing d6} 4. Nc3 {Nc3 prepares e4} e5 {And I call this the Czech Benoni, also sometimes known as the Hromadka Benoni. The Czech Benoni is much more solid than the Modern Benoni, but it is also more passive. Likely to lead to a long, slow, manoeuvring game. Perfect!} 5. e4 Be7 {It is possible for black to also develop the bishop to g7.} 6. g3 Bg4 {She looked at me with a little glee in her eye as she played this move. Surely she didn't think I would overlook an attack on my queen? I quickly played f3.} 7. f3 Bd7 {And then I realised. My white squared bishop now would have very little scope. She clearly had brains as well as beauty!} 8. Qb3 {But I wasn't going to just sit around all day. Let's attack her b pawn. I was out of my opening theory now, and thinking for myself.} Na6 {mmm there almost seems to be an offer of a draw here. If I take on b7 she has Nb4. 10. Kd1 Rb8 11. Qxa7 Ra8 12. Qb7 Rb8 and a sort of perpetual check on my queen. Now do I want to end this game with this stunning beauty opposite me? Not blinking likely! Let's see, a3 renews the threat of queen takes b7 } 9. a3 {So now she prevents the capture on b7} Rb8 10. Bd2 Nc7 11. Bh3 {So I decide to exchange my white squared bishop, which didn't have much scope anyway} O-O 12. Bxd7 Qxd7 13. a4 a6 {I would like to play Ne2 followed by 0-0, but ne2 is met by Qh3! This wasn't so great for me after all....} 14. a5 Na8 {It is almost as if she could read my mind! Black prepares to stop the white knight from going Nc3-a4-b6.} 15. Na4 {So this was played with the idea of Nb6 and if she cpatures I can recapture with the queen. It also ties her knight down to the a8 square} Qc8 16. Kf2 {So time to sort something out about my king....} Nd7 {mmm she may have f5 sometime and my king is not too clever on f2} 17. Qc2 b5 18. axb6 e.p. Ndxb6 19. Nxb6 Nxb6 {So I was thinking this isn't too bad for me. She has an isolated a pawn and her bishop is bad, while mine was good.} 20. b3 {and b3 makes it better - the pawns are protecting the white squares while the bishop protects the black squares} f5 {mmm here comes the attack I feared....} 21. exf5 Rxf5 22. Rxa6 {Ha! Take that my oriental friend! Her queen was over-worked protecting both a6 and Rf5. I glanced at her, hoping to see disappointment or surprise, but all I saw in return was this serene beauty, eyes glued to the board, looking to the left and then to the right. No sign at all that she thought she had dropped a pawn.} Qxa6 23. Qxf5 Qa2 {mm she has got a bit of an initiative in return. } 24. Qd3 {mmm have way through the first session. I offer her a coffee. (The famous "coffee gambit"). She declines (The Coffee Gambit declined).} Nd7 25. Ne2 Rxb3 {Oh my gosh! She has broken through, recovered the pawn, with advantage. Perhaps winning the pawn was not such a good idea after all. What do you think dear reader?} 26. Nc3 Nb6 27. Rc1 Nxc4 28. Rc2 Qa6 29. Bc1 {And now I have gone from being a pawn up to being a pawn down. She played Qa6 with an air of confidence, got up, for the first time in the game, turned round and started looking at the game behind her. I again got a lovely view of her long dark hair falling down her back. I followed the hair down, and then noticed what a lovely nice round behind she had. All sort of silly puns came into my mind. Does she like mooning? Does she live up to her name and like spanking? If so does she prefer to be the spanker or spankee? I had to force myself to concentrate in the game again.} Kh8 30. Qe2 Rb4 31. f4 Kg8 {I don't love to exchange pawns - when material down, exchange pawns, but not pieces. But taking on e5 gives her such a lovely square for her knight.} 32. Qg4 Qb7 33. Qe6+ Kh8 34. Qf7 Qd7 35. Ne4 h6 {while e4 is a nice square for my knight, she makes sure it doesn't advance again} 36. Kg1 exf4 37. Rxc4 Rxc4 38. Bb2 {Aha! Forcing the return of the exchange} Rd4 39. Bxd4 cxd4 40. Qxf4 {and my deficit is down to one pawn - and a doubled one at that.} Qb7 {She once again got up and started looking at the game behind her. I found myself just staring at her lovely backside again. It was so nice, so perfect. It was round, hugged by these tight black jeans. I found myself staring at the W on each of the pockets on the back of the jeans, and the little shiny studs on the corners of the pockets, and how the light reflected off these studs. I noticed how sometimes she would put her hands in her back pockets, and sometimes hold her hands behind her back. Once again, I had to put supreme effort into concentrating on my game again.} 41. Qf5 d3 {mmm this passed d pawn could be a problem} 42. Qf7 Qb1+ 43. Kg2 Qc2+ 44. Kh3 d2 45. Nxd2 Qxd2 46. Qxe7 Qxd5 {mmm no soon as I deal with one passed d pawn, another appears!} 47. Kg4 Kh7 48. h3 Qd1+ 49. Kf4 {And here we broke for lunch. I asked her if she wanted to have lunch with me. She said "I want to go to the bitch." "The bitch?" I queried. "Yes the nice sandy bitch by the sea. I love walking on the bitch." She said smiling. Obviously this Siamese beauty had not mastered English yet. I smiled back. "Me too, I love walking on the bitch. Shall we go to the bitch together?" And so it was I got to spend the lunch break with her, on the "bitch". She was lovely company. I asked her to join me for supper that evening. She told me that she was winning easily, a clear pawn up, and wouldn't consider dining with an inferior player! "What if you don't win then?" "eeef I don't win ziss position I vill buy you dinner!" Right! that was it! I had to save what looked like a hopeless position!} Qf1+ {mmm only one square here, the other options lose my queen!} 50. Kg4 Qd3 51. Qe1 Qg6+ {I thought if I could keep queens on, and perhaps start checking her, I may have a chance.} 52. Kf3 {And now I had an extra two hours on the clock, and the playing arena had emptied. No more distractions from her turning round and looking at the game behind her!} Qf5+ 53. Kg2 Qd5+ 54. Kf2 Kg6 {mmm is she really getting anywhere in this ending?} 55. Kg1 Qe5 56. Qb1+ Kf6 57. Qf1+ Ke7 58. Qf3 d5 59. Qa3+ Kf6 60. Qf3+ Ke6 61. Qg4+ {when in doubt throw in a check!} Ke7 62. Qb4+ {patzer sees a check, patzer takes a check....} Kf6 63. Qb6+ Kg5 64. Qd8+ Kg6 65. Qb6+ Kh7 66. Kf2 Qf5+ 67. Kg2 Qe4+ 68. Kf2 d4 69. Qc5 {mmm now I have run out of check and the d pawn is marching through. Help!} Qe3+ 70. Kg2 Qe2+ 71. Kg1 Qf3 72. Qxd4 Qxg3+ 73. Kf1 Qxh3+ 74. Kg1 {And now, I have the d pawn - but at the cost of losing both my king side pawns. This is going to be hard, but perhaps not impossible. How on earth is she going to advance the pawns without exposing her king to loads of checks again?} Qg3+ 75. Kh1 {So it must be right to stay behind the pawns, maybe my king can help stop them advance at some stage.} Qg6 {mmm blocking off the checks....} 76. Kh2 {mmm here they come...} h5 77. Qf4 Qf6 {Of course I can't exchange queens....} 78. Qe4+ Kh6 79. Qe3+ g5 {mmm my last check just encouraged her to advance the pawn, but I couldn't see what else I could do} 80. Kg3 h4+ 81. Kg4 Qg6 82. Qe7 Qh5+ 83. Kh3 {Kf5 loses for me} Qf3+ {and this reply is forced too....} 84. Kh2 Qf2+ {Kh3 loses, fortunately I have another option} 85. Kh1 Qd4 86. Qe6+ {mmm good a few more checks...} Kh5 87. Qe8+ Kg4 88. Qe2+ Kf5 89. Qf2+ {and now a little stalemate trick!} Qf4 {but she doesn't fall for it. But will she fall for me, that is what I am interested in} 90. Qc5+ {another check, another move closer to that free dinner with the most beautiful girl on the planet} Qe5 91. Qf2+ Kg6 92. Qc2+ Kh5 93. Qd1+ g4 {Damn! I was counting the moves. 50 moves without a pawn move or a capture and it is a draw. I was counting! Now I have to count again...} 94. Qd2 {Qd2 is forced} Qe4+ 95. Kg1 Qb1+ 96. Kg2 h3+ 97. Kh2 {mmm another pawn move....} Qb8+ 98. Kh1 Qb7+ 99. Kh2 Qc7+ 100. Kh1 Qc6+ {100 moves each, and still it is not certain what the outcome will be. We were the only players left in the playing arena now} 101. Kh2 Qf6 102. Kh1 Qe5 103. Kg1 Qc5+ 104. Kh2 Qf5 105. Kg1 Qe5 106. Kh1 Qe4+ 107. Kg1 Qf5 108. Kh2 Qe6 {mmm I am not sure she is really making any progress....} 109. Qa5+ Kg6 110. Qd2 Qe5+ 111. Kh1 Qg5 112. Qd3+ Qf5 113. Qd6+ Kh5 114. Qd2 Qg5 115. Qb2 Qd5+ 116. Kg1 Qd1+ 117. Kh2 Qd6+ 118. Kh1 Qc6+ 119. Kg1 Qc5+ 120. Kh1 Kg6 121. Qd2 Qc6+ 122. Kh2 Qc7+ 123. Kh1 Qb7+ 124. Kh2 Qb8+ 125. Kh1 Qb1+ 126. Kh2 Qf1 127. Kg3 Qf3+ 128. Kh4 Kf5 129. Qg5+ {Aha! now it is MY turn to throw in a few checks!} Ke4 130. Qd2 Qf4 131. Qe2+ Kd4 132. Qd1+ Kc3 133. Qe1+ Kc4 134. Qe2+ Kb3 135. Qd3+ Kb2 136. Qe2+ Ka3 137. Qd3+ Kb4 138. Qb1+ {Although I felt increasingly confident with every check, still her demeanour didn't change, that beautiful face didn't give any hint that the win she had been expecting was not on its way....} Kc4 139. Qc2+ Kb5 140. Qb3+ Kc5 141. Qc3+ Kb6 142. Qb3+ Kc6 143. Qe6+ {It almost felt that the black king was trying to visit every single square on the board. In fact Qe6 was a mistake, and technically changed a drawing position into a lost position for white. I was tiring at the time. Unfortunately for her, and fortunately for me, she couldn't take adavantage of it before the 50 move rule kicked in.} Kc5 144. Qe7+ Kd5 145. Qd7+ Ke4 146. Qc6+ Kd3 147. Qa6+ Ke3 148. Qa3+ {and now, with a sigh of relief I pointed out that it was 50 moves since a pawn move and so it was a draw. I expected to see disappointment on her face, and she just smiled, extended her hand and said "I 'ope you like Thai cooking..." Kf2 would win for black, if there wasn't a 50 move rule., for instance 149. Qa2 Kg1, 150 Qa1 Qf1 and she is eventually going to escape the checks. Thanks for reading this, don't forget to give me some stars and leave a comment!}
