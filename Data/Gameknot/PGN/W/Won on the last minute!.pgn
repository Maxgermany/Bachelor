1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 g6 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nbd2 Bg7 5. e4 {Up to here, a model. Now, even if normally black avoids this move somehow, it is good for white, but the game follows an entire different path from the normal attack that takes place after d4 from black. } Nbd7 6. c3 {Instead of the normal c4, white tries to limitate black's action. } O-O 7. Be2 {The purpose of this bishop is to take BxN if ever black goes Nh5 or Ng5. It doesn't happen in this game, so probably it is not a wise move. Bc4 leads to a completely different attack from white, using Qb3 and Ng5 to press on the white diagonal. } e6 8. Nf1 {Black is playing quietely, so I decided to try another plan. The standard one being h3, Nh2, etc. It is kinda slow, so I try this one that is also very slow... maybe slower. But both of us, incredibly, overlooked that the pawn in e4 is "en prise"...} b6 {Good idea from black. I underestimated this move during the game. } 9. Ne3 {The idea is to support g4, g5, and once the knigh has flawn, h4 etc., castling long. } Bb7 {Now even now we realized e4 was under attack and undefended. } 10. Qc2 {Thinking that the pawn was attacked only by the bishop, I defended it with the queen...} Bxe4 {And now it all became clear. Can this be a kind of "sac"?} 11. Bd3 Bxd3 {Better BxN, I hoped to be able to take gxf3 in order to open some potentially useful lines. Wihtout much hope, to be truthful...} 12. Qxd3 Rc8 13. h3 Re8 {Where to castle? Under the circumstances, castling long - the default plan - seems unwise.} 14. O-O e5 {But I overlooked this one, that wins a piece. Wonderful performance, really!} 15. dxe5 dxe5 {Why wait e4?} 16. Nxe5 Nxe5 17. Qb5 c6 {Foreseen, and lethal. The piece is lost with no compensation. } 18. Qb3 Qe7 19. Rfe1 Qf8 {This bad place for the queen can be useful...} 20. Re2 Rcd8 21. Rae1 {Sets a potential threat. } Nd5 {Tactician's lovers: give yourself a gift analyzing this. BxN, RxB, NxN, Re4xN and all remains the same, so I went for...} 22. Nxd5 Rxd5 23. c4 {Not much, but better than nothing. } Rc5 24. Bg3 {Threatening f4, desperately trying to squeeze the position in order to take some advantage or provoke some mistake. } b5 25. f4 {Nevertheless. We'll see where the queen will go (don't play like this, never :-)} bxc4 26. Qa3 {Complicate it, you never know. The knight is lost one way or another: piece recovered, mission accomplished. } Nf3+ {Black chooses to lose it this way. I have to be careful, now. } 27. Qxf3 {I'm still a pawn under, but my pawn's structure is better than his. } Bd4+ 28. Bf2 {Maybe not a wise choice, but bishops' destiny is to be exchanged anyway, sooner or later. } Bxf2+ 29. Qxf2 Rxe2 30. Rxe2 Rd5 {Black considers better to lose a pawn than to try Ra5!. But after the mistakes I've done, what can I say?} 31. Qxa7 Rd8 32. Re7 Re8 33. Rxe8 Qxe8 34. Qd4 {The only enge I have is his pawn's weakness... but I also have to defend mines. } Qe6 35. Qd8+ Kg7 36. Qd4+ Kf8 {Oh, well, this is for fun, anyway... let's have fun!} 37. Qh8+ Ke7 38. Qxh7 {Now black should grab some pawns and win. } Qe1+ 39. Kh2 Qf2 {Threatening two pawns, indeed, but...} 40. Qh6 Qxb2 41. Qg5+ Qf6 42. Qc5+ Qd6 43. Qxc4 {Now, you see, I have an edge. } g5 {Good try. Black is playing far better than me, given the respective ELO's. } 44. Qe4+ Kd7 {Better Kf6, but who can blame him?} 45. Qf5+ Qe6 {The queen's exchange leaves me undefended against the c pawn, while his king is nearer than mine to the promotion square a8. But I can win with the h pawn, but... it's long to calculate, and I had only few seconds left. } 46. Qxg5 {A big mistake, since the a pawn has much more value than the g one. } Qxa2 47. Qf5+ Kc7 48. Qe5+ Kb6 49. Qf6 {Restricting black's movements. I have to refuse to exchange queens until one of my pawns is far enough to balance or outpass him.} Kb5 50. h4 c5 51. h5 c4 {A fatal mistake by black.} 52. Qxf7 {and black loses a tempo since he has to relocate his queen, and can't deliver check in doing it.} Qf2 {...but now sets Qh4+ and to grab a pawn if white leaves it undefended. } 53. Qd5+ Kb4 54. Qe4 {Blunder, based in forgetting about the queen's check. } Qh4+ 55. Kg1 Qxh5 56. Kf2 Qd1 57. g3 {Now, this is very interesting: can white draw or even win?} Kb3 58. Qe6 Qd2+ 59. Kf3 {White cannot allow a queen's exchange. Will white find tempoes to push his pawns?} Qd1+ 60. Kf2 Qc2+ 61. Ke3 Qd3+ 62. Kf2 Kc2 {Black tries to win. } 63. f5 {This gives me a tempo. } Qd2+ 64. Kf3 Qd1+ 65. Kf4 Qf1+ 66. Kg5 {The previous check saves me a tempo: I had to take away the king from that column anyway before f8, or I'll lose it by a check. } c3 67. f6 Kd2 {Now, the genius (or flop) sequence: } 68. f7 c2 69. Qd6+ Ke3 70. f8=Q {Look what happens in f4. } Qxf8 71. Qxf8 {He my opponent timed out, but if black goes c1=Q, white wins it with Qf4+. If black tries to defend the pawn, based on the known rule of the drawn, it won't work because white has an extra pawn. So Black is lost. }
