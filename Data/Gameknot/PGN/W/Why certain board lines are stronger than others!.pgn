1. d4 e6 2. c4 g6 3. b3 Bg7 4. Bb2 {This move pins not only the R, but the B in front. The K-side fianchetto is very strong against this opening.} c5 {Attacking a pinned P. White cannot take because, obviously 5.PxP BxB 6.Nd2 BxR 7.QxB ...Black is up a R.} 5. e3 Ne7 6. Nf3 Nbc6 7. Ne5 O-O 8. f4 {Black cannot play 8.... NxN, as white follows with 9.PfxP ... leaving black to initiate the c5-d4 P exchange, allowing white to undouble his weakened pawn structure. } d6 9. Nxc6 Nxc6 {Everything is focusing towards d4.} 10. g3 {better, I think, is 10.Be2 Qc7 11. 0-0 .... having opened up both the K- and Q-sides of the board made castling nearly irrelevent. Even if black were to follow through with 11....e5, the subsequent exchange would leave a more open board, allowing white the opportunity to develop minor and major pieces.} Qc7 {This is the only logical square for black's Q at this point, even though she is blocked by white's K-side pawn structure. Playing 10....Qe7 to line up black's Q with white's K takes away one of the few moves black's N has, and as the game hasn't decided which lines will be of import, allowing for N support of d5 and f5 from e7 may yet be important.    Also, if white decides to castle Q-side, then he aligns directly the Q's path.} 11. Bg2 a6 12. Qd2 Rd8 13. a3 {at this point, I was just hoping to have the opportunity to play Bh3, preventing a K-side castle, but to do so I must lure that B from g2} cxd4 14. exd4 e5 15. Bxc6 {a-ha! 14....e5 was the needed bait to remove the B from the long diagonal, and even though a controlling N was removed from the board, black's undeveloped B has the opportunity to plant itself deep in enemy territory.} bxc6 {assumed 15. ...QxP leads to 16. d5 , attacking the Q and removing black's control of the long diagonal while suffering a past pawn.} 16. b4 {White has no  "best move" here, and must settle for the lesser of evils. Less evil, I think, is 16.a4 Bh3 (as was my original design) 17.Na3 .... 18. 0-00, with supporting pieces and a semi-P structure in front for defense. While the N on the edge is not ideal, it's 1 move away from the influential c2 square.                       If white tries to expedite the castling process with 16.Nc3, then 16....PxPd ; or 16.Qd3 (with the intention of 17.Nd2 ....18.0-00 ....) reults in 16. ...Bf5} exd4 {from here I determined 17.BxP BxB 18.QxB c5 19.PxP Bh3 20.Nc3 Re8+ 21.Kf2 Qc6 22.Rg1} 17. Bxd4 Bxd4 18. Qxd4 {Deciding to switch gears at this point, I determine to control the long diagonal. The best way to acomplish this is to force my opponent to respond to MY moves, and plant my Q on c6. I plan to use the Q to control this diagonal due to her flexibility. White's K-side pawn structure is the ideal environment for black's remaining B.} c5 19. Qc3 {It seemed sound for white to remove its Q from the path of black's R.} Qc6 {The Q is removed from the d-file, and black grabs the long diagonal. From here, I honestly figured 20.0-0 Bh3 21.Rf2 Re8 22.Nd2.....which, of course, leads to a longer end game.} 20. Rf1 {I have the game at his point, I just didn't realize how soon, though. from here 21....Qg2 22.Rf2 Re8+ 23.Kd1 QxR .... and with significant advantage, plus a mobile bishop and a second rook to add to the e-file, I figured I could easily turn this into a game of attrition which he would lose very quickly.   However, better is 20. 0-0 Bh3 21.Rf2 Re8 22.Qd2 Re7 23.Nc3 Rae8 24. Rad1 ...} Qg2 {Allowing black's Q to penetrate so deep with an open lane for black's R and good attacking angles for balck's wh-B. } 21. Qf3 {21.Qf3?? .... White cannot recover from this mistake.} Re8+ {The R acts as a crowbar, separating white's K from protection.} 22. Kd1 Bg4 {22....Bg4! ....forcing a trade, effectively removing the Q from any possible further meaningful interventions.} 23. Qxg4 Qxf1+ 24. Kd2 Qf2+ {White resigns.   Any other interference would have resulted in a loss of his Q,P, and R, in that order.}
