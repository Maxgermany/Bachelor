Qd1 Be7 17. g3 {Susan starts here with, "No time for celebration! Game 2 immediately! Caruana v Carlsen!" You have just witnessed a boxer getting knocked down for the 1st time during a fight! He has to be super aggressive now to get back in the match! It is now full pressure on Caruana to even the match!" } Qc8 18. Be2 {In rapid and blitz, things can turn around so fast & no time to find the right defense. This is why Carlsen, in spite of big disagreement among the chess community, decided to offer a draw in game 12 so he can play rapid where he thinks he'll demolish Caruana. } Bg4 19. Rc1 Bxe2 20. Qxe2 Qf5 {I do not like Carlsen's position here. Caruana is doing much better in game 2. Just as Carlsen in game 1, he has a much easier position to play while Black has many issues. } 21. c5 {21. c5 is way too premature! Not a good idea! I know he needs to win but he has to be more patient than this. Caruana needs to build up the tension and not let the air out of the position! } O-O {The tension has diminished. Carlsen back in the game. But it is obviously hard to play being a game down in the playoff. The anxiety now kicks in. Black is fine here. Caruana is simply playing on his adrenaline. He is fighting for his Chess Life in this game! He has no choice but try to make something happen! I cannot blame him for trying, and hoping Carlsen will make mistakes! } 22. c6 bxc6 23. dxc6 Rfc8 24. Qc4 Bd8 25. Nd5 e4 {= This is the test of nerves! Caruana is trying to throw the kitchen sink at the Champion. He has nothing to lose now! He must try to win! He must try to save the Titannic!} 26. c7 Bxc7 27. Nxc7 Ne5 {Caruana is going on a Kamikaze mission! He may go down again in game 2! If Caruana loses this game, the chances of him winning the next 2 to be back even is virtually zero! } 28. Nd5 {? Another compounding blunder by Caruana! Things are looking really bad for White now! Experience matters in World Championship play, especially in the playoff when there is no time to recoup! I expect resignation from Caruana soon! The bleeding is getting worse for Caruana in this playoff! The 1st game was crucial! Once Carlsen scores 1st, it is virtually over as his self confidence is back sky high while Caruana is sinking in quick sand!  What a brutal ending to the 2018 World Chess Championship after 12 straight draws in Classical Chess! Carlsen will retain his title for another two years in spite on being out of form and fragile nerves. But he proves that he is still the best in shorter time control in WC play! Caruana officially resigned! It is now 2-0 in Carlsen's favor in best of 4 games Rapid Chess playoff! The end is near for Caruana! Carlsen has OFFICIALLY regained his Chess Mojo, something he lost in the past few weeks! }
