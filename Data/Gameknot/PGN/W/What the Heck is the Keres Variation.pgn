1. e4 c5 {My toughest victory to date, a hard fought game against Joanne. It's an unrated game because when she challenged me, Joanne's rating was 140 points higher than mine (1627 vs. 1767), so she went for friendly rather than fierce. She begins with the Open Game and I respond with the Sicilian.} 2. Ne2 Nf6 {I only know three things about 2. Ne2. One, it's called the Keres Variation. Two, none of my references on the Sicilian give it any analysis. Three, I handled it badly and got into trouble very early in this game.} 3. Nbc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 {Natural looking developing moves.} 5. Nxd4 e5 {This was a mistake, the consequences of which black will regret for at least the next 20 moves or so. Black should have played 5. ... a6. I'm (obviously) no openings expert, and I've forgotten almost all that I knew 25 years ago when I played competitively. I have learned, primarily from this game (and from not making this mistake in other games as black) that 5. .. a6 is pretty close to mandatory. White's knights are going to be a terror on the queenside for much of this game.} 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 {Finally.} 8. Na3 Be7 {Breaking the pin.} 9. Nc4 Nd4 {Seems like a useful post for the knight.} 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. Nd5 Bg4 {Here I thought I was being quite sneaky.} 12. Qxg4 Nxc2+ {See how sneaky?} 13. Kd2 Nxa1 {Yay, ahead in material, but that knight on a1 is doomed, and then we'll be even, with white much better positionally.} 14. Ndb6 Rb8 {There go those white knights, terrorizing my queenside. It's now that I wish I had kept a bishop or knight around to fight off the evil white equines. Black is in a real bind. The queen's rook is stuck on b8. the queen cannot go to d7 to bring the black bishop to d8, and she's tied to defense of the pawn on d6. All of black's major pieces are bound to the back rank.} 15. Bd3 Nb3+ {More sneakiness, I guess. The knight has to die, might as well make white double her pawns to kill him. Actually, this little tactic will pay off in 20 or so moves. } 16. axb3 O-O 17. Rd1 Bg5+ {Probably not black's cleverest line. What I really want to do is trade places with my queen and bishop, getting the bishop on d8 to drive off white's knight from b6. But it would take a bit of maneuvering, maybe with Qc7, Bd8, Qe7 - if white would even sit still for it. But this pointless check with Bg5+ is just wasting time, mostly, though it does give a little room for the king's rook to come out and play.} 18. Ke2 Re8 19. Kf1 Re6 20. Bc2 Rg6 {White seems to be just shifting about, dragging her king to safety (from what?) and shuffling pieces. Although getting her king and bishop off of the d-file opened up the white rook's attack on d6. Black's little sneaky ploy, if white is careless, would be to play 21. ... Be3 discovering the attack by the rook against white's queen, followed by 22. ... Bxb6.} 21. Qe2 Bf4 {Yeah, I didn't think it would happen. Still, one must try. Now black is poking at h2 and opening the way for Qg5.} 22. h3 Qg5 23. Qf3 Qh6 {Well, something had to be done about the pawn on d6, attacked by knight and rook. It was either this, or Rd8. But 23. ... Rd8 is met with 24. Na4 and the lonely pawn on b7 would be in trouble, requiring 24. ... Qe7, and then 25. Nd5 forks black's queen and the bishop on f4, and now white will win either the e5 pawn or the b7 pawn. What a sad, sad place for a queen. Note: not 23. ... Qf6? allowing 24. Nd7 and white wins the exchange.} 24. Nd5 Re6 {White threatened Ne7+ winning the exchange.} 25. Nxf4 exf4 {Now black's pawn structure takes a little hit, isolating the d6 pawn. Still, it was already backward, so isolated isn't much worse. Thankfully, white voluntarily got rid of one of those pesky knights. Now maybe black will have a little room to breath.} 26. Nb6 Qf6 {Hunting the white b2 pawn while still protecting the black f4 pawn. Note that white can fork the black queen and the rook at b8 with 27. Nd7, but it wins no material after 27. ... Qxb2 28. Nxb8 Qxc7 and now the white knight at b8 is trapped. After 29. Nd7 Qc7 the knight has nowhere to go and must die (actually, 29. Nxa6 is probably best, gaining at least a pawn, but even then white has exchanged bishop+knight+pawn for rook+pawn).} 27. Qc3 Qd8 {White avoided the pitfalls and now seriously threatens the fork at d7. Black could trade queens, but that would liberate the only advantage he has on the board, the isolated white pawns. Now black avoids the fork and chases away the white knight.} 28. Nd5 Rc8 {Black's pawn on f4 is en prise, but the rook on b8 smells its first breath of fresh air and pounces on a chance at the open c-file.} 29. Qd2 f3 {The black pawn was twice attacked and could not be safely defended, so it marches off to suicide, its only compensation is the destruction of the white kingside pawn structure. Well, truthfully, black can get the pawn back on h3 easily enough, so it's not too much of a suicide - more like a sacrifice.} 30. gxf3 Qh4 31. Ke2 Kh8 {Not 31. Kg2? to try and hold the pawn at h3, allowing 31. ... Rg6+ 32. Kf1 Qxh3+ capturing the pawn with check and gaining a tempo. Now that pawn at h3 isn't going anywhere, and black is worried about the possible knight fork on e7. It's a shame to tie the rook on e6 down to the tedious task of defending against the fork. So 31. ... Kh8 seems to be called for, to free the rook.} 32. Bb1 f5 {The white pawn on e4 is pinned, might as well attack it.} 33. Rc1 Rxc1 34. Qxc1 Re8 {Must prevent the back-rank mate.} 35. Qc7 fxe4 {Not much black can do about the queenside pawns, so might as well get some kingside captures.} 36. Bxe4 Qh5 {Now the bishop is pinned, black's queen threatens 37. ... Qxd5 and winning the knight. I think white's strongest move here might have been simply 37. Qxd6 or 37. Qxb7.} 37. Kd3 Qxh3 {Finally capturing the doomed h3 pawn and evening the material - for now. Also, black thratens 38. ... Qf1+, making horrible threats against white's king and other pieces. Note that white's pawn structure is in shambles, and though material is even, it's almost as if white is down by two pawns.} 38. Ke2 Qc8 {If 39. Qxd6, black plays 39. ... Qc7+ and wins at least one, maybe both of white's queenside pawns.} 39. Qxc8 Rxc8 {Finally, 39 moves into the game, I finally breathe a little easier. I've removed white's primary threats and ended up in a winnable endgame. Black's queenside pawns can hold their own against white's queenside, and black has the passed pawn in the center at d6 that white must deal with, and best of all, black has a supported passed pawn on the h-file. It's too much for white's knight to cover both sides of the board, so her knight will most likely end up on guard duty on one side while black's rook goes head-to-head with white's bishop on the other side - a material superiority, especially given that black will have the superior pawns on that side, too. That's the plan, anyway, now to put it into action.} 40. Nb6 Rc5 {White cannot capture the black pawn with 41. Bxb7, for then 41. Rb5 skewers the white knight to the bishop. After 42. Bxa6 Rxb6 43. Bc4 Ra2 and 44. Rxb2, white will have traded away her knight for one pawn.} 41. Kd3 Rb5 {Even without the skewer, the fork is dangerous enough. White must choose between losing the knight or the pawn.} 42. Nc8 d5 {The black pawn at d6 was threatened. 42. ... Rxb3+ 43. Kc2 and now the black rook must run to safety, but not to b6, and the pawn at d6 would still be en prise and would fall to 44. Nxd6. As played, the white bishop must retreat to f5.} 43. Bf5 Rxb3+ 44. Kd4 g6 {Black is finally ahead in material, and could simply capture on f3 then f2. I'm not even sure why I played this zwischenzug; it doesn't seem to gain any advantage for black.} 45. Be6 Rxb2 {Finally, after wasting last move.} 46. Bxd5 b5 {Black can capture f2 or not. It wouldn't change the course of the game much now. Better to just forge ahead with winning moves rather than chasing a trapped isolated doubled pawn that isn't going anywhere.} 47. Bb7 a5 48. Kc5 a4 {The pawn on b5 is defended by the rook (because he didn't run off to the kingside after that doomed pawn). So onward we march.} 49. Nb6 a3 {White's in real trouble now. 50. Bd5 is met with 50. ... b4 (threatening 51. ... b3 followed by 52. ... a2 and 53. ... a1=Q) 51. Na4 (forced) a2 52. Bxa2 (forced) Rxa2 53. Kxb4 Rxa4+ 54. Kxa4 h5 and now white's king is too far away to prevent the promotion of black's h-pawn. This is the point where white resigned.}
