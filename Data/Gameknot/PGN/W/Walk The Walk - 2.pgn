[Opening "Dutch defence, Blackburne variation (A81)"]

1. d4 {Hopeing for a classical QGD.} f5 {Battlefleet is a fan of Alekhine whereas I,m a follower of Capablanca.Like most positional orientated players I consider the Dutch opening as semi correct whereas warriors of the ilk of Alekhine Botvinnik and Korchnoi revel in the challenges it provides.} 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 e6 4. c4 d5 5. Nh3 {Under the old classical rules I learnt as a youn boy 40 years ago a Knight on the edge of the board was frowned upon.With modern more concrete analysed chess many old rules of thumb have been over thrown.The position is semi closed so tempi isnt a factor so the White Knights Duo plan of N-h3-f4-d3 and N-d2-f3 to try and lock down e5 is playable.} c6 6. Qc2 Bd6 {Contesting the key square e5} 7. Nf4 {7.Bf4 may be preferable} O-O 8. Nd3 {One knight in place as per plan.} Nbd7 {Sending more troops to contest e5.} 9. O-O Qe8 {more troops} 10. Nd2 {Heading for f3.} e5 {Novelty?Breaking out before white can lock down e5 with Nf3} 11. dxe5 {About here the Gameknot computer gives white his best plus score +0.26.} Nxe5 12. Nxe5 {On reflection I now prefer 12.b3 looking for a white plus rather than the text trying to play super solid against the master.} Bxe5 13. cxd5 Nxd5 {Black has equalised and is threatening to take over the iniative.} 14. Nf3 Bf6 15. Bg5 {Looking to trade off the better of the Black Bishops.} Be6 16. Bxf6 Nxf6 17. Nd4 g6 18. Nxe6 {Tradeing off hopeing to prove that the white Bishop is the superior minor piece to Blacks Knight.} Qxe6 19. b3 {Inaccuracy.19.Rfd1 followed by 20.b4 was superior I think.The plan would be to weaken and immobilise blacks Q side majority.} Rad8 {Sent with the Master's draw offer.I decided to take a bird in the hand rather than play on.Though against a lower rated player I would have played on.Objectively speaking I think the final position is dynamically equal .......opinions?}
