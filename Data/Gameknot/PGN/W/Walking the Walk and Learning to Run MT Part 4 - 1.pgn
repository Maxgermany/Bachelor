1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {Attacking the weak pawn} 5. Nc3 {protecting the e pawn and developping} Be7 6. Be2 {To enable the castle} O-O 7. Bf4 {developping } Re8 {Rokk on the central semi open fils} 8. O-O {Both kings are safe} Bf8 {To menace 9. ... Nxe4 10. Nxe4 Rxe4} 9. Bg5 {preventing the attack on e 4} h6 10. Bxf6 {trading} Qxf6 {Queen on the first rank} 11. Nd5 {attacking the queen} Qd8 {White is ahead in developpement but has two unprotected pieces} 12. Bf3 {To protect the e pawn} c6 {The knight will have to leave} 13. Ne3 {13. Nc3 was another option but it would have blocked the c pawn that white planned to advance} Nd7 {developping} 14. c4 {White doesn't want to loose control on the center The plan is to take control of d5} Nf6 {Attacking the e pawn} 15. Qc2 {15. Qd3 was another candidate move but the queen would be less safe and I want to set a rook on the d file aiming at d4, d5, d6.} Qb6 16. Rad1 {The ideal place for the rook.} c5 {Attacking the d knight but letting d5 without protection} 17. Nb5 {To bring the knight on c3 from where it can attack d5} a6 {Chasing the knight} 18. Nc3 {White developpement is almost completed.} Be6 {To protect d 5} 19. b3 {Now the queenside is safe} Rad8 {Reinforcing the center.} 20. Ncd5 {I consider that white's developpement is sufficient to launch the attack on d5} Bxd5 21. Nxd5 Nxd5 22. Rxd5 {So the trading period is over, back to positional moves : Material is equal. Both kings are safe. There are no immediate threats. White pawn structure is better but black can easily reorganise his, all the pieces on both side are protected but white is far better on the center and therefore contrlos more space and has more mobile pieces. So that white's plan is very simple : take the d pawn and bring a rook on d8, eventually gaining material.} g6 {A good move, to prepare 23. ... Bg7 which will reduce white's available moves and give black some countergame with the help of the queen.} 23. Rfd1 {Seeing no immediate danger, white carries on his plan.} Bg7 24. Rd5d3 {To avoid 24. Re5} Bd4 {Good move which seriously slow down white's plan, for I need now to advance 26. a3 ... 27. b4} 25. Qd2 {To prevent 25. ... Qa5} Kg7 {I felt unsafe because I hadn't planned this move at all but it seems to be a defensive move, so that I carry on the plan. Black prepares his castle against the assault.} 26. a3 Re5 27. b4 {Now, white has a second plan : 28. Qc2 and 29. Rb1 to promote a pawn on the queenside.} Rde8 28. Qc2 h5 29. g3 Qc7 30. Bg2 Qe7 31. Qe2 b6 32. a4 {}
