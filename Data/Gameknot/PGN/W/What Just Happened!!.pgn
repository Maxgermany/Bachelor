[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed, Korchnoi variation"]

1. e4 c5 {My favorite Black opening, the Sicilian.} 2. Nc3 {It's closed.} e6 {Black creates what is known as the Korchnoi Variation.} 3. Bc4 {I ignore the book (which probably yelled out 3.g3 at me) and I attempt to take over the d5 square. From now on, keep your eyes fixed at that square.} Nc6 {Black goes for d4.} 4. Nf3 {When I played this move, I forgot about 4...Nd4.} Nd4 5. d3 a6 {Black already knows which side he's going to attack. Me; I'm stuck here with that rock solid Kinght on d4. I think to myself,"Do I really need to attack that Knight?"} 6. Be3 {Yes, but what was that Knight doing there? Absolutely nothing. I probably should have ignored it for now.} b5 {My Bishop is now officially trapped in the pathetically crammed Queenside.} 7. Bb3 Qb6 {I wonder what Black has planned?} 8. a4 b4 {After this, I should have made use with the Knight's position and played 9.a5.} 9. Ne2 {Now is a good time to remove the Knight off of d4.} Nxf3+ {or maybe just trade it off.} 10. gxf3 {Only reply.} e5 {Now, I'll follow with 11.d4.} 11. d4 Qg6 {Black's queen carries itself to the wrong file.} 12. dxc5 {This works, but to the extent of losing a pawn.} Qg2 {Rook or pawn, what am I going to keep?} 13. Rg1 {I'll keep the rook.} Qxh2 14. f4 {I start wondering if I'm being too aggressive.} Nf6 {By now, I see Black trying to win another pawn.} 15. f3 {After this move, I think that I'm too aggressive, but I don't think I listened to myself. } Bb7 {I get irritated at his pieces for this threat to my weak e4 pawn.} 16. Bd5 {I hope to win the exchange.} Bxd5 {I think you can guess what happened next without scrolling down.} 17. Qxd5 {What have I done?!! Now I'm completely lost.} Nxd5 {I don't know if he figured this out or not, but it seems like I was losing and then he gave up? First of all, I do not see what I can do about this situation if he had continued. I think that he overreacted and thought I didn't lose my queen and that he lost the center, but even though you lose the center, it doesn't mean that you'll lose the game without a doubt.}
