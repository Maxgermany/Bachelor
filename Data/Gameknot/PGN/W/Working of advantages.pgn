[Opening "Lengfellner system (C00)"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d6 {This is the French Defense going into what's called the Lengfellner system.  White has something of an advantage here due to greater control of the center - the battle here will come on the fifth rank rather than between the fourth and fifth rank, which threatens Black much more.} 3. Nc3 c6 4. f4 Be7 {White has three pawns in the middle of the board in attacking position, while Black is in a more reserved position, with his bishop weaker than White's engaged knight.} 5. b3 Nf6 6. Bb2 {I have previously been on the record as criticizing the fianchetto but have come around.  White's fianchetto is set up, while Black has likewise gotten better by getting his knight involved, though his bishop is pinned in.} O-O 7. e5 {White could do some more positioning but would rather attack the middle of the board before it gets clogged with Black's pieces.} dxe5 8. dxe5 Qxd1+ 9. Rxd1 Ng4 {White has eliminated both e-pawns, traded queens, and got his rook involved far earlier than normal.  Here it's a good thing.  Black is going to try to harass White with his knight.} 10. Rd3 Nd7 11. Be2 {White's knight was moved to try and combat a fork he foresaw from the knight, and is now attacking the knight, while Black is trying to move his second knight.} Nh6 12. Nf3 Nf5 {White has chased Black's knight back and gotten his own knight involved, setting up to castle and get all pieces involved in the position.} 13. O-O Bc5+ {A harmless check meant to keep White's king from getting too close, trying to pin it back in the corner.} 14. Kh1 Ne3 15. Rc1 Nd5 {Black's knight is trying to harass White's position and vaguely threaten it.  White has had enough and wants to free up his well-positioned bishop on b2.} 16. Nxd5 exd5 17. c4 {White does not like the vaguely threatening Black pawn position and would like to throw a wrench into it.} Nb6 18. cxd5 Nxd5 19. Rxc5 {Black has left his bishop en prise and White has also managed to destroy Black's pawn position, though at a cost of leaving his f-pawn undefended.} Nxf4 20. Rd2 Ne6 {Black has retreated and although White's pawns are rather more scattered than Black's, his pieces are much more involved.} 21. Rc1 b5 22. Rxc6 Bb7 {Black figures he wants his fianchetto, and will get it at whatever cost, but foolishly wastes a pawn.} 23. Rc1 h6 24. Bxb5 Nc5 25. Rxc5 {More and more pieces just waiting to be picked off.} Bxf3 26. gxf3 {This is one of the dumber moves Black has made.  Black should, when already down so much, conserve whatever pieces he can. Entirely unnecessary trade. } Rab8 27. Bc4 g5 28. e6 {White's attack is coming.} fxe6 29. Bxe6+ Kh7 30. Rc7+ {White's continual checks drive Black's king toward the middle of the board.} Kg6 31. Bf7+ {A blunder, though White will at least get a rook for his two pieces.} Rxf7 32. Rxf7 Kxf7 33. Rd7+ Kg6 34. Rxa7 {Picking off Black's last pieces.} Rf8 35. Ra6+ Kh5 36. Kg2 {Black's king dangerously pinned in.} Rf4 37. Rd6 Rf8 38. Kg3 {White trying now to move in for the kill. Black's king has no moves.} Re8 39. Bd4 Re2 40. a4 {White is missing the checkmate possibility and is just annoyingly kibitzing with Black.} Ra2 41. Ra6 Rd2 42. Be5 Rd5 43. Bg7 {White FINALLY sees it.} Rd3 44. Rxh6# {Notice how White got a small advantage (a piece, positioning) and exploited it, trading pieces to make the advantage more dramatic.}
