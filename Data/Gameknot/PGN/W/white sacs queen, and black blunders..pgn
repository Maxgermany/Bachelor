1. d4 {This is a decent game where white plays a queen sac which, trough blacks blunder lead to a won game.} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Nf3 {The queens gambit declined. (I think thats what it is called) } dxc4 5. e4 e5 {Computer gives this as a mistake giving white a reasonable edge. It aslo loses a pawn.} 6. d5 Nb4 7. Nxe5 Bc5 8. Bxc4 Qf6 9. Nf3 Bg4 10. O-O O-O-O {Black castles queen side and places his rook on an open file. Perhaps playing Ne7 and trying to short castle was better.} 11. Be2 {Unpinning the knight.} Ne7 12. Bg5 {Gaining a tempo and developing. White now only has to get his queen out.} Qg6 13. Qd2 f6 14. Be3 Bxe3 15. fxe3 {If Qxe3 Nc2 fork queen and rook.} Bxf3 16. Bxf3 f5 17. Nb5 fxe4 18. Bh5 Qg5 {Black cant take the bishop, because Qxb4 leaves a7 and e7 attacked.} 19. d6 {This move seems to lose a piece, but thats not the case.} Qxb5 20. Bg4+ Kb8 21. dxe7 {Dxe7! A queen sac.} Rxd2 {Black accepts it. Here black still has a chance for an equal game.} 22. Rf8+ Qe8 {Only move to stay in game.} 23. Raf1 Rxf8 {And this blunder loses, best was rd8.} 24. Rxf8 c6 25. Rxe8+ Kc7 26. Rc8+ {And black resigns due to the massive material advantage which white will have after he queens the pawn on e7.}
