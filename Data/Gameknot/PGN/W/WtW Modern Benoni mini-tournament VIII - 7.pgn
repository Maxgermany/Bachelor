1. d4 {Thematic benoni game} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 {main line} 7. h3 {i do not like to advance the f pawn and h3 is the only other way to prevent 7. ... Bg4 or 7. ... Ng4} Bg7 {main line} 8. Bd3 {White chooses a quiet line (I often play 8. Bb5)} O-O 9. Nf3 {The same quiet line for black, preparing a central attack.} b5 {The central line chosen by white let black with open space on the queenside and Last Archimedean tries to exploit it. } 10. Nxb5 {Double edged move. It opens the b file for the black rook and the white knight can be easily fired. Another candidate move was 10. Bb5 to prevent 10. Re8 but white's plan is still the central attack and I want to menace black's d pawn with 11. Bf6} Re8 {Solid move} 11. O-O {Castling when it's time} Nxe4 {Logical move.} 12. Re1 {If 12. ... Nf6 13. Rxe8 Qxe8 13. Nxd6} a6 {Attack from the knight} 13. Na3 {Even Lancelot the brave has to retreat sometimes.} Nf6 {Attacking d5} 14. Rxe8+ Qxe8 {That was part of white's idea but after 13. a3, white cannot take the d pawn. Black is doing well and plays solidly.} 15. Nc4 {But I want this pawn and send Lancelot to the battle again} Bb7 {At first I thought this move was a blunder for : 16. Nxd6 Qd7 17. Nxb7 Qxb7 and white is one pawn up but if 18. Bc4 to protect the d5 pawn. 18. ... Rd8 and the pawn it dead for I cannot bring any other piece to protect it so that I think this is a very good move.} 16. Nb6 {So that I have to elect another move. I thought a lot about it because the knight is unprotected and has only two squares to retreat. But it seemed the only way to save my d pawn.} Ra7 {No choice} 17. Bc4 {Now the d pawn is secured but I do not like the position at all for black controls the open file, the long black diagonal  and the center (not directly but with his f knight, queen and c and d pawns). Luckily for white his other pieces are blocked.} Nbd7 {Good move to get rid of the b knight.} 18. Nxd7 {No other choice (If 18. Na4 Ne5 19. Nxe5 Qxe5 and white is in trouble for black controls the center and the white king feels lonesome in his castle.} Qxd7 {18. ... Nxd7 might have been better, preparing 19. ... Nb6 and the black queen would have staid on the e file.} 19. Rb1 {First organising the queen side to resist an eventual attack of the DSB.} Ra8 {To liberate the rook.} 20. Qd3 {Preventing 20. ... Ne4} h5 {? It weakens the black king and achieves little. Re8 would have been better.} 21. b3 {Everybody is in safety on the queenside.} Nh7 {? Blunder. For the knight is less efficient on the far side and it let white the control of the e4 square.} 22. Bb2 {To get rid of the ennoying powerfull black bishop and liberate the b rook which has to come on the e file that black doesn't occupate.} Bxb2 {Black had little choice (if 22. ... Bf8 23. Qc3 menacing mate.)} 23. Rxb2 {So, this diagonal can be mine when I want, by Qc3. White has now a clear positionnal advantage being more mobile and controling the center.} Qd8 {Black cannot play 23. ... Re8 any longer for 24. Bxa6} 24. Re2 {Now it's time to attack. First take control of the open file. White position also improves because all his pieces are connected (black's one are dispersed).} Ng5 {Probably to force the knight exchange. Black might look for a draw.} 25. Nh4 {Menaces 26. Nxg6 fxg6 27. Qxg6+ Kf8 28. Qxg5 with two pawns advantage and a very weak black king.} Kg7 {To prevent 26. Nxg6} 26. Qg3 {Menacing the knight and after 26. ... Nh7 preparing 27. Nf5+ Kg8 28. Nxd6} Nh7 {Forced move.} 27. Nf5+ {Fork attack between the king and the d pawn.} Kh8 {27. ... Kg8 was the other candidate move but it wouldn't have changed a lot the situation.} 28. Nxd6 {Fork attack between the bishop in b7 and the f pawn.} Qd7 {To protect both b7 and f7} 29. Qe5+ {queen and rook on the same file.} Kg8 {29. f6 would have been better but white's position is far better and it would not have saved black.} 30. Nxf7 {If 30. ... Qxf7 31. d6 and the black queen is lost. If 30. ... Kxf7 31. d6+ Kf8 (forced move) 32. Qh8+ mate.} Rf8 {Mate in one} 31. Nh6# {}
