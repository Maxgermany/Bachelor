1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Qb3 Nce7 11. O-O {Giuoco Piano, as it has been played a million times before; usually follows 0-0, Rfe1, c6, Ne5, Nf5, Bxd5, Qxd5, Qxd5, cxd5, Ndf3, with easy play for White...} c6 {but this cannot work; I presumed...} 12. Bxd5 Nxd5 {after cxd5, Rfe1, 0-0, Rac1, Re8; after Qxd5, Qa3, Be6, Rfe1... this leads to other complications...} 13. Rfe1+ Kf8 14. Qa3+ {or Nd7, Qa3...} Kg8 {too late for Ne7, Re3!...} 15. Ne4 g6 {desperately seeking for Kg7, and releasing Rh8...} 16. Nd6 Kg7 17. Re4 {to be honest, I was lost for a better move here: I did not trust Ne5, Be6, maybe unjust; I would follow this up with Rae1 and see where it leads us...} Rb8 18. h4 {again, I could not find an immediate progress after Rae1, Be6, Qc5 and/or Re5; this move however seemed appealing at the time...} Bf5 19. Nxf5+ gxf5 20. Re5 Qd7 {this came as a bit of a disappointment; I was counting on f6, Ree1, a6, Nd2, Rg8, Qf3 (not Qh3, Qc8, Qf3, Kh8)... all the more reason to have played 17. Ne5...} 21. Re2 {again: after Qxa7, f6, Re2, Nf4, Re3, Rhg8, I found no progress...} Rhg8 22. Ne5 {seeking for play; maybe better Rae1, Qc7, Re5...} Qe6 {by then, I had underestimated this reply, and counted on Qc7, Qf3, f6, Nd3, followed by Qxf5...} 23. Rae1 Kh8 24. h5 {also here, played on a whim; after Qf3, Rbf8!, h5 or Rc2, or even Qd6!?, Rbf8!, I could see no progress...} Qf6 25. Qf3 {at this time, I might have considered g3, but after f4!, Qf3, Rbc8!, White is left with nothing...} Rbd8 26. h6 {again, the best move I could find; after Rc8, Qh5, Rc7, Nd3, we still hold an edge...} Rg5 27. Qb3 {played without hesitation; after f4, Qxb7, Rxg2+, Kxg2, f3+, Kf1, fxe2+, Kxe2, Nf4, Kd1, Rxd4+, Kc1, White is winning...} Rf8 28. Qxb7 {the only one; but I had no real answer for Blacks' reply...} Nf4 29. f3 {sounder might have been g3, Nxe2+, Rxe2, f4!, Qxc6, Qxc6, Nxc6, fxg3, Nxa7...} Nxe2+ 30. Rxe2 Rh5 31. Qxc6 Qxc6 32. Nxc6 Rxh6 33. d5 {not much play is left...} Rd6 34. Ne7 Rb8 35. b4 h6 36. Rd2 Rbd8 37. Kh2 {by now, the game is dead equal; after f4, b5, Black is even a slight bit better...} Rd8d7 38. Nc8 Rd6xd5 39. Rxd5 Rxd5 40. Nxa7 Rd8 41. Nb5 Rb8 42. a4 Kg7 43. f4 Kf6 44. Nc7 Rb7 45. Na6 Ke7 46. b5 Kd6 47. Kg3 Re7 48. Kf2 Re8 49. a5 Rc8 50. Ke3 Kd5 51. b6 Kc6 52. Nb4+ Kb7 53. Nd3 Rc4 {at this point, Black offered a draw; which I gladly accepted, sick of how this game turned out... no e4, e5, Nf3, Nc6, Bc4 ever again; I will switch to Bb5, walking Spanish...}
