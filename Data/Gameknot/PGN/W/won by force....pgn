[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 {the Hungarian variation in the Sicilian: after Nc3, we prefer d6...} 3. d4 Bg7 {no fear for dxc5, Qa5+, winning the pawn back...} 4. Nc3 cxd4 {forced...} 5. Nxd4 e6 {following the Hungarian in preparing Ne7 and d5: sharper was a6 against Nb5, but White is oblivious...} 6. Bb5 a6 {point made...} 7. Ba4 Ne7 {b5 can wait...} 8. O-O b5 9. Bb3 O-O 10. Nf3 d5 {as always: d5 on the menu...} 11. e5 Bb7 {too late, to turn this into a closed Sicilian...} 12. Re1 Nf5 13. Bg5 f6 14. exf6 Bxf6 15. Bxf6 Qxf6 {we need to control d4...} 16. Ne2 Nd7 {connecting the rooks, and aiming for Nc5...} 17. c3 Nc5 18. Bc2 Rad8 {no comments needed: the White Queen is getting into trouble...} 19. Rf1 h6 20. Nfd4 Ne4 {after Bxe4, dxe4, Nd4 is pinned...} 21. Bxe4 dxe4 22. Qb3 Bd5 23. Qb4 Bc4 {closing all the gaps...} 24. Rae1 Nxd4 {time to break up the tensions...} 25. cxd4 Bxe2 26. Rxe2 Rxd4 {winning a decisive pawn...} 27. f3 {chess blindness, or a prosaic way of resigning? } Rxb4 {I guess, we will never know: after this, White resigned...}
