[Opening "Nimzo-Indian defence (E20)"]

1. d4 {Steve commented "Played to avoid his big theory in the Sicilian" although I have never been impressed with Brian's knowledge of any openings.} Nf6 {Preventing 2. e4 of course.} 2. c4 {The most played reply, although not the only move possible,} e6 {Possibliy heading for a Nimzo-Indian?} 3. Nc3 {White continues to develop sensibly. } d5 {Black transposes back into the Queen's Gambit Declined.} 4. Qc2 {4. Qc2 is a very unusual move. 4. Bg5 4. Nf3 or 4. e3 are more common.} c6 {Black goes into a Slavic pawn formation.} 5. e3 {Played presumably as white was afraid of black capturing on c4 and continuing with b7-b5. I am not sure that white really needs to worry too much about this though.} Be7 {Black continues to develop.} 6. cxd5 {This seems to release the pressure on black's centre, and rather contradicts white's previous move which seemed to suggest that white was going to keep the pawn at c4, protected by the white squared bishop.} exd5 {This recapture allows the Bc8 to develop.} 7. Bd3 {Sensible development by white.} Be6 {Steve comments "already happy with my position". I am not sure why - to me the position seems very level, very quiet, and black does not have the usual problem with the Queen's Gambit Declined, of how to develop the Bc8. If I were black I would be happy with the position.} 8. Nf3 {Sensible development of the knight.} h6 {Presumably to stop Ng5} 9. h3 {"to stop any Ng4 or Bg4 and preparing a big pawn storm. I'd already decided on my plan to as necessary get the pawns rolling if I could". I think white is being rather over-optimistic, and black's position is very sound. Fritz prefers 0-0, Bd2 or Ne5.} Nbd7 {Sensible development of the knight. The position is dead even.} 10. Ne2 {Fritz prefers 0-0 or Bd2.} Nb6 {"dubious taking away the knight from the kingside". I don't think that black is at much risk on the kingside, but I do wonder what the plan was with this move. Where is the knight going to head from here? Fritz prefers 0-0 or c5 with equality.} 11. Nf4 {Steve gives himself an exclamation mark for this move, but I am not sure it is that good. Fritz prefers the simple 0-0.} Bd7 {Fritz does like hanging onto the bishop.} 12. Ne5 {Fritz is still calling out for 0-0.} Bd6 {"he's now moved both his bishops twice giving me the tempo needed to put the boot in with a positional sacrifice". Fritz actually thinks that 12....Bd6 is the best move.} 13. Nxf7 {Fritz is still wanting 13. 0-0 and 13. a4 is an alternative, with a slight edge to white.} Kxf7 {Fritz gives this as +1.45 in black's favour, but as we shall see, in practice black's position is not that easy to play over the board.} 14. Bg6+ {White throws in a check. Where would you move the king to dear reader?} Kf8 {"His poor pieces!!!!! Rh8 looks totally out of the game as does Ra8 and his other pieces don't help much". I personally think you could make similar comments about the Rh1 and Ra1 and Bc1. White just doesn't have the development to justify the sacrifice. Nb6-c8-e7 and black is fine.} 15. O-O {At last!} Nc8 {"now this horse has moved three times too". Fritz does give this as the best move, and to me it is the obvious defence.} 16. f3 {Fritz prefers Bd2 or Bd3. "Controlling e4 and preparing the big pawn roller!" So white still very optimistic, but Fritz still giving this as plus 1.45 in black's favour.} Ne7 {Fritz now gives this as plus 1.71 for black. 16. Qb6 was also good for black.} 17. g4 {Steve gives this another exclamation mark. Fritz prefers Bd2 or b3.} Bxf4 {Black wisely decides to meet this show of aggression by exchanging some pieces.} 18. exf4 {White takes back.} Nxg6 {Now this bishop goes.} 19. Qxg6 {and white takes back.} Be8 {Black hits the queen.} 20. Qd3 {The queen drops back "I'm happy now....I have all the dark squares and the pawns are going to start becoming space invaders". Fritz is giving this position as plus 1.44 to black} Qd7 {This is a mistake. Without a black squared bishop the black queen belongs on black squares. 20....Kf7 or g6 was better.} 21. b3 {"Threatening Ba3+!!". Steve gives 21. b3 an exclamation mark, but Fritz prefers Bd2 or Re1.} Bf7 {Presumably to contest the e file with Re8 at some point.} 22. Re1 {The file is taken.} Re8 {Blck contests it.} 23. Ba3+ {The check comes in.} Kg8 {King moves.} 24. Re5 {"yes must get exchanges to get rid of a pair of rooks but also to get my kingside pawns even stronger!". Fritz actually prefers Rxe8+} Rxe5 {Black takes - this is a mistake - better is g6 preparing Kg7 and getting Rh8 into play.} 25. dxe5 {"not the other pawn". Well done Steve, Fritz agrees with you this recapture is better.} Nh7 {"still struggling for room" Fritz agrees that this is best retreat and give the position as plus 0.54 for black. } 26. Re1 {Supporting pawn adavance.} Nf8 {Trying to find a better square for the knight.} 27. f5 {Threat e5-e6 winning back the piece. Fritz agrees this is the best move.} Be8 {And Fritz agrees that this is the best defence. } 28. f4 {The pawns keep advancing. Fritz gives this as plus 0.47 to black.} Qc7 {"Best try to get Queen active". Fritz prefers 28....Qd8 or 28....b6} 29. Kg2 {"Prophylaxis and to prepare for an active King in the endgame to give me further compensation". Fritz prefers 29. Bd6 or 29. Re2} Qa5 {"attacking my Bishop and Rook....looks a good try but this just helps me!" In fact Fritz gives 29....Qa5 as the best move for black, and black as plus 0.55 now.} 30. b4 {The only move to save both pieces.} Qb5 {This moves looks sensible to prevent the b pawn advancing again, so preventing the Ba3 doing much on the a3-f8 diagonal, Fritz prefers 30...Qa4 (+0.55) or 30....Qb6 (+0.47). "Realised this Queen needs to be removed now as it's becoming a bit of a pain and I can cripple his pawns and leave his minor pieces still pretty bad so I exchanged....doesn't look that logical but he has no counter-play if the come off".} 31. Qxb5 {Fritz gives a small advantage to white now.} cxb5 {Black takes back.} 32. e6 {Again, given an exclamation mark by Steve, but Fritz prefers 32. Bb2 or 32. Kg3.} Nh7 {Fritz now gives this as +0.90 to black.} 33. Rc1 {Again Fritz prefers 33. Bb2 or 33. Kg3} Bc6 {"forced". Indeed it is the only move to preserve black's advantage.} 34. Kg3 {White advances his king.} Kf8 {Black too moves his king to a better square.} 35. Bb2 {At last this bishop takes up its best post.} Nf6 {Black gets his knight into play again.} 36. a4 {"tricks afoot and he's got not much time". Fritz prefers Kh4.} a6 {Steve thought this was forced. It is the best move, but black also keeps a slight advantage with 36....b5xa4} 37. axb5 {White correctly opens up the a file for his rook.} axb5 {Clearly the correct way to recapture.} 38. Ra1 {Steve of course immediately puts the a file to good use. Fritz still gives a very small advantage to black.} Ke7 {The only move to keep black's small advantage.} 39. Bd4 {Steve again finds the best move - but Fritz still gives a small advantage to black.} Rc8 {Black prevents his rook being cut out of play on h8 again.} 40. g5 {Steve gives 40. g5 two exclamation marks, but Fritz prefers both Kh4 and Kf3. with the evaluation equal. Steve thought he was winning.} hxg5 {This is a mistake, undoubling white's double pawns. 40....Ne4 gives black the advantage (+0.88)} 41. fxg5 {White takes back. White really does have an advantage now.} Ne4+ {Knight takes up a powerful central position.} 42. Kf4 {And the white king also correctly heads for the centre. Note how this square would not have been available if black had not exchanged pawns on g5.} Rh8 {I think this can be considered the losing mistake. 42.....g6!! keeps white's advantage to managable proportions (0.63 instead of 1.96)} 43. Bxg7 {"after 15 mins thought - I had to check for his mate threats"} Rxh3 44. Ra8 {"Threatening Bf8 mate amongst other nasties" Steve gives 44. Ra8 two exclamation marks, but Fritz prefers 44. Bd4 (+3.03) and 44. Ra8 as the second best move (+2.78)} Nxg5 {"I think this was forced" - indeed it was Steve!} 45. Kxg5 {So the knight goes.} Rg3+ {Hoping to win the bishop.} 46. Kh6 {White saves the bishop} Rh3+ {Another check.} 47. Kg6 {White has a plan for getting out of the checks.} Rg3+ {Black keeps checking, but in fact he is driving the white king into a better position.} 48. Kh7 {White continues with his plan.} Rh3+ {Black keeps checking.} 49. Kg8 {"now my King is safe and helps my attack too!" Excellent observation by Steve, who is clearly winning now. Stopping the white pawns is now very hard.} Rf3 {Black tries to stop the pawns.} 50. Rf8 {Excellent move by Steve!} Rf4 {Hard to suggest anything better.} 51. Rf7+ {Fritz gives this as the third best move - Fritz thinks 51....f6 and Bf6+ are better.} Ke8 {It is getting very hard for black now.} 52. f6 {How are these pawns going to be stopped?} Kd8 {The match depended on this game - all the other games were finished, and wite had to win the game to draw the match.} 53. Rf8+ {A check to drive the king away from the advancing pawns.} Kc7 {King moves.} 54. f7 {"The final nail....too many threats surely" Indeed there are!} d4 {"The final Blunder in time trouble"} 55. Be5+ {"Black resigned as his Rook is gone amongst other stuff". Many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system so that I know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
