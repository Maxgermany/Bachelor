1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ng5 h6 6. Nxf7 {This was a themed mini tourny so all the games start here. It's a extremely speculative sac, but I think white has a good chance of making it through if black doesn't play great.} Kxf7 7. Qxg4 {This is the most popular move after Kxf7} Bd6 {Probably ?! as it blocks in the queen's pawn and therefore the LSB. I understand he was trying to defend his pawn, but development is crucial in openings like this.} 8. Bc4+ {I develop with check} Kf8 {Maintaining defense of the g knight, good move} 9. Qf5+ Qf6 10. Qxf6+ {? Probably a bad idea to trade off queens when I'm behind.} Nxf6 11. Nc3 Nc6 12. d3 Nb4 13. Bb3 {Prevents the fork} Ng4 14. O-O {I add extra pressure to the f pawn} Bc5+ 15. Kh1 Nf2+ 16. Kg1 {? Allows a discovered check that wins a pawn.} Nfxd3+ {I expected that.} 17. Kh2 Nxc1 {?! I would say it was a ? to trade a developed and active piece for an undeveloped one, but he's ahead so it isn't that bad as he aims to trade off material. } 18. Rfxc1 {?! Probably better is capturing with the other rook as it wasn't doing as much. The reason that I used this one is because I hadn't noticed that the knight and bishop were defending a2 so I didn't want to move my rook that is defending it.} Be3 19. Rcf1 c6 20. a3 {I shove the knight away} Nxc2 {?? I guess he didn't notice that my bishop could take the knight.} 21. Bxc2 d6 {Allows his bishop to leave} 22. Rf3 Bg4 23. Rff1 Ke7 {Here I would put black as ahead. His bishops are wonderful and he's up a pawn.} 24. b4 {I grab some space} Raf8 25. a4 Rhg8 26. b5 {I keep advancing} f3 27. gxf3 Bf4+ 28. Kh1 Bh3 {I've equalized, but my f pawn is in possible danger} 29. Rf2 Be5 30. Ra3 {I defend the knight} Bd4 {Those bishops are driving me crazy. I would still put black as ahead.} 31. Rd2 Rg3 {?? The sad blunder that loses. I would assume that he plans to double up rooks, and get checkmate but I manage to avoid mate and hold onto my extra piece.} 32. Rxd4 Rfxf3 {I think doubling rooks on the g file might have been better.} 33. Rc4 d5 34. exd5 Bf1 {He looks menacing, but I'm not really worried about it as I analyzed and it seems he doesn't really have a way of getting mate.} 35. Re4+ Kd8 36. dxc6 {?? a blunder. Loses my knight.} Rfxc3 37. Rxc3 Rxc3 38. cxb7 {It's now the endgame. Black has won back his piece, but white is still winning.} Kc7 39. Re7+ Kb8 40. Be4 {I prepare to play Re8+ and then b8=Q+} Ra3 {Mate in three} 41. Re8+ Kc7 42. b8=Q+ Kd7 43. Qd8# {And checkmate. I felt it was a good game, comments are welcome.}
