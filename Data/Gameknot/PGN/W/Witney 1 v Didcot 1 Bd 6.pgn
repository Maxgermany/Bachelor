[Opening "English (A22), Carls' Bremen system"]

1. c4 {The English Opening.  I've always had trouble finding a consistently successful response but recently 1... e5 seems to have served me best, so...} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Nc6 {Seemed sensible to develop the QN to its most active square before deciding where to put my KB.} 4. Bg2 Be7 {Happy at this stage to develop quietly onto squares that seem most natural and defensively strong.} 5. d3 {... as is White, it seems.} O-O 6. Nf3 h6 7. O-O d6 {I was falling behind on the clock by now and the next move caused me to think even longer.} 8. Rb1 {!? Interesting and unexpected but I'm not sure it's any better than (eg) 8. a3 or 8. Bd2.  Eventually I decided that the probably planned pawn to b4 needed to be discouraged.} a5 9. a3 {Confirming my suspicion ...} d5 {I decided to counter-attack in the centre before White could progress his Q-side plan.  This move not only demands a response but also opens up the KB's view of b4, again discouraging White's planned advance. } 10. cxd5 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 {By now I was ahead on the clock slightly and remained so for the rest of the game.  I had been slightly chary of this exchange as it left my Q in the line of a revealed attack from the fianchettoed B but I couldn't see any seriously injurious way that White could exploit it.} 12. Bd2 {White reverts to his plan for the b4 advance.} Qe6 {I decided that discretion was the better part of valour and retreated the Q from the long white diagonal.} 13. Be3 {!?  Seemed an odd move, after the previous B move.  Eventually, I decided that it was either to support  a d-pawn advance or to enable a knight manoeuvre via d2 to either b3, c4 or e4, depending on how I responded...} Rd8 {developing the KR to the half-open d-file.  All White's attention seems directed towards a Q-side attack so I decided the R wasn't needed to defend the K-side.} 14. Qc2 {White gets his Q out of the R's sights.} Bd7 {Developing the B and connecting the Rs.} 15. Nd2 {as expected, eventually ...} Rac8 {Completing my development by putting the QR on the c-file.} 16. Ne4 {Now the N lands on a beautiful central square, threatening to attack my Q.} b6 {a natural move getting the pawn off the long white diagonal and preventing the WN's threatened move to c5.} 17. Rbc1 {White ratchets up the pressure on the c-file} Nd4 {virtually forcing an exchange that will leave me with the bishop pair vs N and B.} 18. Bxd4 exd4 19. Qc4 {Interesting response ...} c5 {I decided that if we were to exchange Qs it would be best to do it in a way that improved my position rather than White's.  this pawn move gives me more room and creates a strongpoint on d4.} 20. Qxe6 Bxe6 {Now I was well satisfied with the scope of my Bs and Rs.  My position seemed harmonious and full of potential for an winning attack.} 21. Nd2 {A surpise retreat but I soon worked out that the N was probably heading for c4 to attack b6.} b5 {Mobilising - and nullifying the previously noted threat.} 22. Rc2 {Threatening the double Rs on the c-file.} Rc7 {responding likewise...} 23. Be4 {preventing my king escaping from back row checks via h7.} Rdc8 24. Rfc1 f5 {forcing W to retreat his B.  I wasn't concerned about exposing my K at this stage as there didn't appear to be any scope for W to exploit the opened up lines.} 25. Bf3 Bg5 {exploiting the fact that W has prevented his f-pawn from moving by pinning the N against W's R.} 26. h4 {White immediately challenges me to decide what to do with the B.} Bxd2 {Sad to give up the advantage of the B pair but swapping that advantage for disruption of W's position by undoubling his Rs.} 27. Rxd2 c4 {pressing forward with my attack.} 28. dxc4 Rc7xc4 {Necessary to protect the isolated d-pawn, rather than retaking with the b-pawn.} 29. Rcd1 {W piles on the pressure on the d-pawn.} Rc4c2 {Rather than defending the pawn for a very drawish-looking position, I decided to offer to swap it for the b-pawn so that I'd have a q-side pawn advantage with potential to queen.} 30. b4 {A sensible response.  White now looks certain to capture the d-pawn.} axb4 31. axb4 Rxd2 {After W recaptures, I intended ...Rc4, defending the d-pawn and threatening the b-pawn.} 32. Rxd2 Rc4 33. Rb2 {So I'd saved the d-pawn but not yet managed to obtain a winning passed pawn.} Bf7 {?! I had picked up the B, intending to play it to d2, to support the b-pawn, but belatedly realised that I would lose the exchange after the response Bd5+, so I hastily rerouted my hand to park the B on f7.  An unfortunately wasted move as its only use was to obstruct the freedom of my K.} 34. Rb1 {probably to prevent a back-row check and enable W to centralise his K} Kf8 {Now my K starts its own centralisation a move later than it should have done.} 35. Kf1 {White responds likewise but his K is obstructed by his pawns, so Black gets the positional advantage over the next few moves.} Ke7 36. Ke1 Kd6 37. Kd2 Ke5 38. e3 {White attacks the d-pawn and threatens to skewer the R and b-pawn from e2.} Rc3 {a necessary response.  Now, if 39. Be2 then ...Bc4 defends while maintaining the pressure.} 39. exd4+ Kxd4 40. Be2 Bc4 41. Bd1 {W avoids the exchange while ceding further territory - but Black's attacking options are limited by lack of resources.} Rd3+ {testing White's awareness of potential discovered checks etc} 42. Kc2 {Of course, 42. Ke2 would have been a horrendous mistake allowing Rb3+, winning the rook.  Retreating onto a black square would have avoided that bu ceded more space.} g5 {Wanting to avoid repetition, I decided to initiate action on the other side of the board to limit White's options.} 43. hxg5 hxg5 44. Rb2 {Just about White's only move...} g4 45. Rb1 Ra3 {hoping to win the f-pawn.} 46. Rb2 Ra2 47. Rxa2 Bxa2 {Now my advantage is dissipated and my pawns are all on white squares, giving White a slight advantage, despite his apparently cramped position.  It took me a while to realise this ...} 48. Be2 Bc4 49. Bd1 Bd3+ 50. Kb3 Bc4+ 51. Kc2 {Now I might as well have conceded the draw by repetition but I wanted to exploit my considerable time advantage: I had about an extra 30 minutes on the clock by this stage.} Bf1 52. Kb3 Kd3 {?? Trying to gain access to the f2 pawn, I missed the fact that White could now mop up my f and g pawns.} 53. Bc2+ Ke2 54. Bxf5 Kxf2 55. Bxg4 Kxg3 56. Bd7 Kf4 57. Kc3 {!? White sp in the hope that he might be able to force a win.urned the opportunity to force a draw by 57. Bxb5, leaving me with insufficient mating material} Ke5 58. Be8 Kd6 {and I offered the draw, which was gratefully accepted.  I had 27 minutes left, my opponent just over 4.}
