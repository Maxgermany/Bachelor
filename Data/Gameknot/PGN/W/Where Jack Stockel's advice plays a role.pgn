1. Nc3 {In this particular game, I made many mistakes during the beginning and middle games, but I did not give up because I remembered Jack Stockel's advice to, "Think about things".  I also remembered, from Jack Stockel, that there are usually second chances to correct mistakes after a mistake has been made.  As a result, I was able to trick my opponent into a three fold repetition.  That trick is shown here, from moves 12-16.} d5 2. d4 {I made this move to prevent my opponent from playing d5 and threatening my knight with exc3.} Nf6 3. Bg5 {This move was made to threaten my opponents knight on the f square, with Bxf6.  If I was able to capture his knight, I would have been able to mess up his pawns.  In other words, I would have been able to put him in a situation, so that two of his pawns would be on the same square.} e6 4. Qd2 {This was a big mistake because I should have played Bxf6, captured his knight, and forced two of his pawns on the same square.  Instead, I play Qd2 to trick him and put pressure on his queen and knight.  Now he is able to eliminate this threat. } Be7 {Now he plays Be7 to put pressure on my knight.  I either could have taken his knight or pulled my bishop back.  Instead, I make a bigger mistake on my next move.} 5. e3 {Now, I have made one of my biggest, maybe the second most serious, mistake.  I played e3, without even thinking about it.  When I look at this board, he could have played Ne4 with a powerful fork between my queen on the d square, and my knight on the c square.  That is not the other half of the story.  He also could have left his bishop attacking bishop on the g square, if he had moved his knight.  Instead, he castles on his next move. } O-O 6. Bf4 {I had to pull the bishop back in order to prevent him from threatening my knight with his bishop.} Bd6 7. Bxd6 {This is where I decided to exchange bishops with him.  This might not have been the best move, but I wanted to get his bishop, off the board.} cxd6 {Now, he likely made a mistake, because he now has two bad pawns.} 8. O-O-O {This was my biggest mistake.  I should have moved the knight and bishop on the other side so that I could castle on the kings side, as opposed to castling on the queens side.  At this point, my king is exposed.} Nbd7 9. f3 {This was another big mistake.  I should have moved my knight with Nb2 or Nb5.  Nb5 would have been my best move.  My queen would not have been allowed to break through, I would have been able to win a free pawn, with Nd6. } Qa5 {Now my knight is pinned on the c square due to my last mistake, what am I going to do now?  I am not going to resign, but I will try to find a way out of trouble because this where I remembered Jack Stockel's advice.  His advice was, "Don't give up right away."  He would also say, "If you know that you cannot win, try to get a draw."} 10. a3 {This might have been a good.  It was good, in one way, because it might have put some pressure on the opponent.  On the other hand, it might not have been so good because I did not use judgement before I made the move.} b6 11. b4 {This was a great move I put pressure on his queen and some stress on him.  As a result, I was able to get a draw, instead of a loss against him.  This, "forced draw", started here, after the opponent made a move. } Qxa3+ 12. Kb1 Qxb4+ 13. Kc1 Qa3+ 14. Kb1 Qb4+ 15. Ka2 Qa5+ 16. Kb1 Qb4+ {}
