1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 {This move stops the e5's Budapest. Does it?} e5 {I can get something back for the pawn (if Nxe5) by Bb4+, d6, etc. Maybe.} 3. e3 {White blunders with this move. Not easy to see why, but for sure, what happens if...} e4 {White loses a tempo reatreating the N, while I'll be able to defend e4 with d5. Wonderful. } 4. Nfd2 d5 5. c4 {Natural and almost forced to develop without being squeezed in. } Bb4 {? Not a particularly good idea, since I'll have to exchange this B with a WN. } 6. a3 Bxd2+ 7. Nxd2 {Now my problem is easier to understand: after cxd5, I can't take it back with the N (or Nxe4), but Qxd5, Bc4 is bad. I can't allow that. } Bg4 {Trying to do sometihing more than c6. After cxd, cxd, White has a strong attack on the white diagonal (a4-e8) I must be aware of. } 8. Be2 {Wonderful! I have another try... like...} h5 9. Bxg4 {? Maybe better was h3, forcing me into the exchange. Anyway. This represent an unique opportunity to open the h column for my rook, and keep white distracted from d5. } hxg4 10. O-O {? Instead of attacking, castling just into the enemy's fire is a common mistake. Don't overestimate castling. } Qd6 {Mate threat in one. } 11. g3 {Practically forced. Now my attack will go on... on the h column, with the Q. If I could remove Nf6 from the board... Qxg4 will stop my plans. But I need my Q on h. So let's make the hard way. } Qe6 {Without the lsb, cxd just helps me. But my Q's journey proved very costly. See how. } 12. Qb3 {b7 is threatened, and I should have played b6, and if Qb5+, c6. White needs more tempos to penetrate. But I let him in!} Qf5 {ONe move from a nasty mate threat. Go on, take my R!} 13. Qxb7 {...but I realized now that white doesn't have to take the R... after my Q is gone to h5, Qc8+, Qxc7+. I shield it with my N and everything should be ok. } Qh5 14. h4 gxh3 e.p. 15. Kh2 {! The good one! But now, } Ng4+ 16. Kh1 {...and here I "had" to break in somehow. I bet my life on it...} Nxe3 {Let's see. As a sac, Nxf2+ was more accurate. } 17. fxe3 Qe2 {!? This lets again white with the choice to take both R (Qc8, QxRh8, or Qxa8). But it threatens mate on g2 all the same, so white has only one move. } 18. Rg1 {How to go on? I could only see...} h2 {...but this time, Qc8+, Ke7, QxRh8, hxRg1=Q+, KxQ, Qxe6+, Kg2, Qxd4... I'll look into it deeper later. } 19. Rf1 {!? now white is a move from adding Rxf7+ to his possible threats! Is black dead???} Rh3 {?? Qc8+ wins it. Say I played Rh5, please... :-)} 20. Qxd5 {Preferring the check threat to the R. } c6 {Saving the R. I'm feeling busted. } 21. Qxf7+ {Now I got the way to win. But Re1 must go out of there. Can you see it? No, not Qe1+ or Qd1+ (Re1 and back and forth). } Kd8 22. Qf8+ {Come on, white, come on... } Kc7 23. Rf7+ {Done! I was already sure my opponent didn't realized that by doing so, he gave me an one-move mate threat. If he doesn't mate me, I win!} Nd7 {Go on, take my R! Take my N with your and try to give a perpetual to me...} 24. Qxg7 {?? Overlooking the mate threat. Of course, after Qe1+, Nf1 would follow. So?} Qg2+ {A little brilliancy... } 25. Kxg2 h1=Q+ 26. Kf2 Rh2# {And that's all folks! Don't follow my examples, just have fun with them! :-)}
