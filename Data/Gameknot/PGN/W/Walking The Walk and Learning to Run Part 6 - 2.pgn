1. d4 {Thanks to stalhandske for the game.} d5 2. e3 {I had annotated in the same time i played the moves. I don't move the pieces to work visualization, i don't use a computer, so all can be totally wrong. ______ About analysis the game, in post-mortem, i try to look : __1.opening Who know the most theoretical moves ? if not me i have to work the opening. __ 2. Middle game Did i seen the opponent threat on each moves ? Did i had a plan ? __ 3.Ending Did i had a plan ? Did i know the technique needed ? __ 4.Other Where is the/a turn of the game Find my mistakes (strategy ? tactics ? ) and study the weakness. ? Which move i would like to take back ? Which move i am glad to had played ?} Nf6 3. Bd3 e6 4. Nd2 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. f4 {post-mortem : The end of the thematic line} Bd6 7. Ndf3 O-O 8. Ne5 Ne4 9. Qc2 {This is where my theory knoledge ends. __ i try 9.QC2 to threat to win d5 and keep the f3 square for Ng1. And i will continue my developpment with b3, Bb2.__the day after i had played 9.Qc2, i realize 9...c4 and c2 is not available for Bd3.___and something like a week after 9.Qc2 i suppose this move is going to be the move i would taken back. __ POST-MORTEM, so yes I would like to takeback this move. I will prefer now 9.Nf3 to continue to put pieces in the game } f5 10. Ngf3 {it looks like a double stonewall___POST-MORTEM : Soltis talk about the double stonewall....at the end of his book, and i have started by the beginning, snort :-)} Bd7 11. O-O c4 12. Be2 {POST-MORTEM, once again it seems Qe2 is better becasue let the seat for Bc2} Be8 {candidate moves : 13.Nd2 (and i am back checking e4)___13.b3 (but is it ok to open the c column for black ?) cxb 14.axb Ne7 (if the idea is to attack c3) 15.c4, but of course black can not take on b3 and so ???? no lines appears to me___few days/hours after...why black played 12...Be8, may he wants to have his queen-bishop outside his pawn structure. if yes, 13...Bh5 will come. 13.Nd2 answer to the black move.___between 13.b3 which can be bad or 13.Nd2 which have 2 positive points, well let's go for Nd2.} 13. Nd2 g5 {ok, black attacks. Why does black thinks he can attack ? probably because a lot of his pieces are available on the king side (Ne5, Qd8-g5, Be8-h5 and the rook with an half-open column g next) and not mine ? if yes perhaps just trading Nd2 is good way because it give faster control to Qc2-h2 ?___14.Nxe4 fxe4 15.fxg5 Rxf1 16.Bxf1 Qxg5__or__14.Nxe4 fxe4 15.fxg Qxg5 16.Rxf1} 14. Nxe4 fxe4 {well, i had miss-visualizated (or an other word,^^). 15.fxg5 looks, now, not good because 15...Nxe5 16.dxe5 Bxe5. So i am going to take and repeat again and again the moves to have a better visualization of the position in my brain....i hope 14.Nxd4 wasn't a too late mistake___candidate moves : 15.fxg5 (what does really happen if i take) ; 15.b3 (but look strange and so why i think about this move and why i like it so much ??) ; 15.Bg4__15.fxg5 Nxe5 16.dxe5 Bxe5 17.Xx Qxg5 aoutch.__15.b3 gxf4 16.exf4 (and no idea for my 2 and a half line)__or__15.b3 (h5 16.bxc4 g4 17.bxd5 so i suppose black has to take) 15...cxb3 16.axb3 but even i am not able to visualize well i don't see something against 15.b3___15.Bg4 Qe7 16.....no idea, but nothign seems to happens, nice for me____so let's go 15.b3} 15. b3 b5 {ohhh no exchange, no game for me on the queen side. I have to solve the pressure on the king side, i take the other candidate move on the last move__16.Bg4 Xxx 17.b4 gxf4 18.exf and i have win space but e4 is free now__16.Bg4 Xxx 17.f5 looks dangerous because my developpement is not yet finish.___ i will try to visualize after 16....} 16. Bg4 Qe7 {so still in mind 17.b4 but is 17...h5 is possible ? ___ 17.b4 h5 18.Bxh5 Bxh5 19.NxNc6 i can't really see the position in my mind, but i suppose Rf2, g3, a3, Ra2 will be possible to protect the king.__ i writte i can't really see but it seems i have improve in visualisation. Glad when working give results.} 17. b4 a5 {oh oh noooooo, 18.a3 is not possible because no Bb2. I hadn't seen this. OK, I keep still, is it annoying or not ? 18.bxa5 Nxa5 and...and...aoutch no idea__ 18.Nxc6 and once again it open sight Bd6.__ and don't take a5 looks dangerous (open column a and will open column c. So i take and i will think about the 2 and a half moves later.} 18. bxa5 Nxe5 19. fxe5 {19.dxe5 give a big black centre. White (oups it's me) doesn't look roomy :-(} Rxf1+ 20. Kxf1 Bc7 {21.Bd2 h5 22.Be2/d1 Bxa5 i don't like but i suppose i can just wait.} 21. Bd2 h5 22. Be2 g4 {g4-g3 could be very boring because Qf2 in the future so 23.g3 h4 24.Kg1 and my king will have to tramp, time needed to wait ?} 23. g3 Bxa5 {24....b4 is the threat ? 24.a3 Bc7/d1 25.Bc1 h4 26.Kg1 (just to play something) and black can move Be8 and Rf8 to use the column f. ___ I am not able to evaluate the actual position. I feel very bad but objectively can I have a draw ? the position is already lost ? do i have counter-play ?} 24. a3 Qg5 {No panic is the most important __ what is the threat with Qg5 ? what does it change ? Perhaps it open a path for Rh7-f7, Qf5+ add with h5-h4 ? __ so Kg1 is a candidate move, Ra1-f1 against ___ 25.Kg1 Ra7 26.Rf1 Bd8 27.Bd1 Be7 28.Qa2 b4 aoutch __ 25.Kg1 Ra7 26.Kh1 Bd8 27.Bd1...well i don't see how my queen and rook move to each flank. } 25. Kg1 Bd8 26. Kg2 Ra7 {still thinking it is dead for me. Just try to keep in mind to try to keep the most possible h close to avoid Rh7-Qhx ; try to keep control on e3 and on the same time against b5-b4....aaaaaaaahhhh, panic mode.} 27. Kg1 Qh6 28. Bc1 Bg5 29. Qd2 h4 30. gxh4 {may h2 could be a buckler ? } Qxh4 31. Bf1 {to control h2 against Rh7} g3 32. h3 Bh5 {autch, Rh7 and Bg4.} 33. Ra2 Rf7 34. Qe1 Bg4 {so Bg4 works also before Rh7 ? 35.hxg4 Rh7 __ 35.Rg2 perhaps ? __ anyway thanks from black saying i have well defended.} 35. Rg2 Bxh3 36. Qxg3 Rxf1+ 37. Kxf1 Qxg3 {}
