1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Ng5 Ngf6 6. Bd3 h6 7. Ne6 {Early sacrifice to take advantage of opponent's cramped position.  Note that he MUST move his Queen, because if 7. ...fxe6, then 8. Bg6#!} Qb6 8. Nf3 fxe6 9. Bg6+ {Setting up potential King and Rook fork from Knight at f7...} Kd8 10. O-O Nd5 11. Qe2 {Planning to remove Knight at d5 next move with c4...} c5 {He attacks pawn...} 12. c4 {...so I attack Knight!} Nc7 13. dxc5 Nxc5 {Better move for Black might have been Qxc5...} 14. Be3 {...because taking the Pawn with his Knight allows me to pin his Knight to his Queen, AND he removes his Knight's protection of the e5 square (the jumping off point in preparation for a Knight fork at f7).} Qd6 {I don't know if there was a better place for his Queen...} 15. Rad1 {...but moving it to d6 allowed me to pin his Queen to his King with my Rook.} Nd5 {His only choice is to lose a minor piece so he can un-pin his Queen...} 16. cxd5 {...allowing me to get back almost even in the game...} exd5 {Don't look ahead; do you see a surprise move that will ultimately win the game for White?} 17. Rxd5 {Is this a gross blunder?} Qxd5 {Could be... down a full Rook now!} 18. Rd1 {Ah, but there's that nasty pin again! } Qxd1+ { After the exchange...} 19. Qxd1+ {... I have given up two Rooks for a Queen and am still down by a Pawn... but he MUST answer to check...} Nd7 {Note that even though the Knight protects the jumping off point (e5) for the threatened Knight fork at f7...} 20. Ne5 {... it is pinned firmly to his King... almost as if it weren't there at all!} Kc7 {Now I can still easily win the Rook... after Nf7, followed by Rg8, I can attack his Rook again with Bh7, leaving him nowhere to move his Rook.  Tempting as it may be, let's not forget that the object of the game...} 21. Qc2+ {... is to checkmate your opponent!  There is one for White, several moves ahead.  Can you see it?  If he moves his King back to d8, the Knight fork at f7 would certainly be my best option.  Better move his King to safety...} Kb8 {Can you see a checkmate for White yet?} 22. Nxd7+ {Black's only option to get out of check is to... } Bxd7 {...take the checking Knight with his Bishop.} 23. Bf4+ {This allows White to move and mate in three... ONE!} e5 {Black blocks check with his Pawn (could have used Bishop)...} 24. Bxe5+ {...TWO...} Bd6 {Now he has to lose his Bishop as well, and finally...} 25. Bxd6# {... THREE - Checkmate.  Lessons to be learned here?   1.  Attacking moves greatly limit the possible responses of your opponent. 2.  Look for sacrifices, and use them to your advantage. 3.  The pin is mightier than the sword... 4.  Winning material is very important, but checkmating your opponent is the ultimate goal in every chess game.}
