1. d4 {This is my first game with bridgecommander. I am playing black. Please comment on the annotation.} c6 {I wanted to do something different, probably why I never gained ground. Moved c6 in preparation for d5.} 2. e4 {Since I never really opened with c6 before, I was unprepared for this advance. Although in hindsight, it seems like it shouldn't affect my plan, butIdid decide to not push d5.} d6 {I wish I would have moved d5 instead of d6. I typically am more aggressive and wanted to try a defensive move instead. Also, this move took the game out of the database. Probably more of a disadvantage for me to do that.} 3. f4 {That looks imposing.} Qc7 {Decided to castle queen side.} 4. Nf3 Bg4 {People have done this to me a lot, so I've been trying it myself to pin the knight. I think the goal appears to be to disrupt the kingside pawn structure.} 5. h3 {Worked as planned, although not much of an advantage.} Bxf3 {I decided to trade my LSB for the knight. Only real benefit I could see is to further disturb the king's pawns, but the there's that massive pawn onslaught down the middle I'll have to deal with. Never been here before, so we'll see what happens.} 6. Qxf3 {Oops, I guess that really didn't work out at all. I just traded my bishop for a knight for no apparent benefit.} Nd7 {Now just trying to castle before the pawns attack.} 7. Bc4 {Debated e6 to defend, but the king seems very vulnerable. It think I'll give up f7 and just castle now.} O-O-O {I don't really feel much safer.} 8. O-O {Now that I see the king castle short, white doesn't really look very vulnerable with all my pieces undeveloped. What a mess.} Kb8 {I wanted to protect my a pawn. Definitely should have moved e6.} 9. Bxf7 {First blood and nothing I can do about it.} Ngf6 {Trying to get my knight out of trouble. Really pointless with those center pawns. I'm way out developed here.} 10. e5 Nd5 {The white pawn troop make their move.} 11. c4 {No time to develop without losing that knight. Not moving e6 was a big mistake.} Nb4 {Wondering if Nb6 would have been better. Although I think a black c5 would have made me move it again.} 12. Qb3 {Queen threatens the unprotected knight. He's really doomed, just hasn't figured it out yet.} Qb6 {Pulling the queen out to protect. It bothers me my pawns and minor pieces are relatively undeveloped and the queen is out front. I haven't been in a game like this where I've done well without an opponent blunder. I don't think that will happen here.} 13. e6 {Not many configurations more disturbing than this pawn-bishop combo two rows from promotion. I am thinking I will have to sacrifice something to keep a promotion from happening.} Qxd4+ {My only real threat the whole game, rather empty at that.} 14. Be3 {Simply deflected and now my queen is in trouble.} Qd3 {I know I'm behind in development, but hoping white will trade queens to relieve the king file pressure.} 15. exd7 {But white has other plans. If I am forced to take her queen, it opens the white rook up. Now down 2.} Rxd7 {I wanted to remove the pawn promotion threat and didn't consider 15... c5. That would have supported the knight and stopped the bishop from taking a2, but I didn't think of it during the game.} 16. Bxa7+ {With the bishop and queen on this side, I thought there must be a mate coming very shortly. My goal was to defend until the end.} Kxa7 17. Qxb4 {I am surprised the 15... Rxd7 wasn't considered a mistake. The c5 move really seemed to accelerate the loss.} d5 18. Qc5+ Kb8 19. Be6 Rd6 20. cxd5 {There's that bishop-pawn combo again. There must be a name for that configuration. It shows up quite a bit.} Kc7 21. Nc3 b6 22. Qa3 Qd4+ {A temporary offensive front. A second check! Yippee!} 23. Kh2 {Meant nothing really, everything on the white side is totally supported. The queen has little help.} b5 24. dxc6 Qb6 25. Bd5 b4 {A fork! In this game, I have to have my mini victories as I lose.} 26. Nb5+ Kb8 {Not sure why I didn't take the knight... maybe it's because white wanted me to and I felt compelled to rebel.} 27. c7+ Kc8 {Another pawn threatening. That decision early on has haunted me this whole game.} 28. Qa8+ Kd7 29. c8=Q# {Nice finish. Makes sense in this game to lose to a pawn promotion since I let them advance in the opening. Enjoyed the game!}
