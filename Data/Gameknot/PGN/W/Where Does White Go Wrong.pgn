[Opening "Giuoco Piano (C50), four knights variation"]

1. e4 e5 {A mini tournament within my team, the Cynical Cynics, for players 1600 - 2000. I'm playing black. My opponent opens with 1. e4 and I'm feeling adventurous, so I give him the Open Game, my favorite as white, so today I'll play against it instead - actually the second time on the same day I made this choice to wear the other man's moccasins.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {The Giuoco Piano. Quiet Game. Yuck. Not my style. I like active, aggressive games. Still, seems a very strong option for black here, being the 2nd most common and 1st most successful for black.} 4. Nc3 d6 {White opted for the Four Knights variation, far less common than the main line 4. c3 or the less appealing Evans Gambit 3. b4. In fact, out of the five moves in the DB with over 100 games played, 4. Nc3 is the best move for black. Black's far most common response is 4. ... Nf6 which the DB says is even. Not hard to believe since the position is exactly mirrored. But the move played, 4. ... d6, while far less common, has positive results for black. I could play either, they both suit me just fine, but I went for the one with the best results.} 5. d3 Bg4 {White is determined to mirror, and once again the DB says 5. ... Nf6 is black's most common response but very even, and once again the 2nd most common response favors black much more than the most common response, so I go for the better move. But not number 2. Nope, have to dig down to number 4 to find this one. Still favors black, but more importantly, I like being aggressive. Black has gone from the Quite Game to making aggressive moves. } 6. h3 Bh5 {Inevitable. But black still maintains the pin on the white knight. The threat is Nd4 which then threatens to ruin white's kingside.} 7. a3 a6 {7. a3 is a waste of time and not even in the DB. Black responds with 7. ... a6 which seems to mirror white's waste of time, but there is one difference. Without 7. ... a6, white has 8. b4 Bb6 9. Na4 and white can exchange black's very useful bishop. So 7. ... a6 is played to open an escape hatch that lets black retain a bishop on the a7-g1 diagonal. Even though white loses a little tempo here, her forces black to make a flank move too, and white's game still looks very strong.} 8. Bg5 Nge7 9. Nd5 h6 {The pressure mounts. White is attacking the pinned black knight on e7 with two pieces. Something will have to give soon. Even so, there is no way for white to bring in a third threat, so this attack may have been premature. White would probably be better served getting his king to a more defensible location.} 10. Bh4 O-O 11. g4 Bg6 {Inevitable again.} 12. Bxe7 Nxe7 {Much of the pressure eases.} 13. h4 Nxd5 14. Bxd5 c6 {To defend b7 and send the bishop packing, but better still, to prepare for 15. ... d5.} 15. Bb3 d5 {Time to strike at the center. Note that the black pawn on e5 is now hanging, but if white takes it, black can win the pawn on e4. This move, 15. ... d5 isn't game-winning, but it sets the stage for what is to come.} 16. h5 Bh7 {This poor bishop has been harried by white pawns 3 times since he first joined the fight. White has destroyed his kingside by chasing this bishop, but black's bishop on h7 is biting on granite, so the moves seem sound enough. On the other hand, there is an attack mounting on e4 and granite or no granite, this bishop has a strong influence on that attack.} 17. exd5 cxd5 {White saves his e4 pawn, but now black has gained the strong center and has much more mobility for his pieces. In addition, his strong bishop pair is a decent advantage in such an open position. The black pawn on e5 is still hanging, but now white would lose his knight after 18. Nxe5? Re1.} 18. Qd2 Qf6 {Time to attack. Black's queen is very strong on the a1-h8 diagonal with only that little pawn on e5 in the way. Further, the queen on f6 threatens the undefended white knight on f3. 18. ... Qf6! surrenders the pawn on d5, but that is now inconsequential.} 19. Bxd5 e4 {19. Bxd5 looks safe, and it defends the en prise knight on f3, but it may be white's losing move. 19. e4! gets a big old exclamation point. Black now has Qxb2 any time he wants it. White's knight is en prise and must move or be captured - white had thought his bishop on d5 was defending the knight, but now black's pawn is in the way. 20. Bxe4 loses a piece to 20. ... Bxe4 21. dxe4 Qxf3. And 20. dxf3? loses the knight immediately. So the knight must move, but it has no good moves - everywhere it can safely move will leave it stranded on the edge of the board.} 20. Nh4 exd3 {The coup-de-grace. The black pawn on d3 is defended so the queen cannot capture it. White cannot allow 21. ... dxc2. So the pawn must be captured.} 21. cxd3 Rad8 {And now white's bishop on d5 must fall. If 22. Bxb7? then 22. ... Rfe8+! 23. Kf1 Rxd3 and white's queen has nowhere to go. All of her safe moves allow 24. ... Qxf2#, and all the moves that prevent the checkmate allow the queen to be captured by black. 22. Bc4 seems to save the bishop and defend the d3 pawn, but loses to 22. ... Rfe8+ 23. Kd1 b5! and now the white bishop is lost and black has a real thread on d3 to skewer the white queen to her king. At this point, black's best option might be to sell the bishop dearly with 22. Bxf7+ Rxf7 23. Nf5+! which blocks the f-file and the b1-h7 diagonal. Sure, white will lose more material, but he may blunt all of black's attacks long enough to save both his king and his queen. Faced with this, white resigned. Truth is, I'm not sure where white went wrong. 7. a3 wasted a tempo, but that couldn't have been the sole reason for white's downfall. White essentially stranded his king in the center by wrecking his pawn structure chasing black's bishop, but many kings survive being in the center. I truly don't see an evident game-losing flaw in white's play, but black's multiple threats here are truly game-ending (or create enough of an advantage to secure an easy win). I don't know where white went wrong. It must be the accumulation of little weaknesses and then 19. Bxd5 that really drives the nail into the coffin. Still, white's game looked sound, and the danger in his 19th move is not easily evident.}
