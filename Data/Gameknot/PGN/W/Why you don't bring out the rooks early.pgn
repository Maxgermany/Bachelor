1. h4 {I open up the H rook so the queen can protect it if I have to open it up.} h6 {Jir goes h6. I have no clue why.} 2.

Re3 {I start the attack} Nc6 {He brings out the knight.} 4. a4 {Now I try to get my second rook out. Unfortunately, his bishop is preventing me from bringing it out.} Bc5 {He attacks my other rook} 5. Rc3 {I counter attack} d6 {He guards his bishop} 6. a5 {I move my a pawn once more to bring out the rook} a6 {Another move I don't get.} 7. Ra4 {Double the pain.} Nf6 {He develops his other knight} 8. Rg3 {Here's my first mistake, instead of developing, I attack recklessly.} Nh5 {He attacks and defends.} 9.

Ree3 {move back} Qxh4 {He goes in for the kill.} 18. Reg3 {I try to yet again, fork his knight, not paying attention to the mate in four.} Bd7 {threatens my next pawn} 19. e3 {I be greedy and fork} Nde6 {He moves his d knight} 20. exf4 {I take} exf4 {He takes} 21. Rgh3 {I threaten his queen} Qxf2# {Gets me with a bishop and queen. The biggest mistake I made in this game is that I didn't move many pieces, because I was trying to attack (which epicly failed), and I spent half of my turns moving pieces, which means he was like 10 moves ahead, which is terrible. Rooks aren't good in cluttered positions like these because you can't move them very far. I never developed much pieces, and thats my big #1 mistake right their. Hope you enjoyed this annotation.}
