[Opening "Gruenfeld (D87), exchange, Seville variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {The game starts with the Gruenfeld Defence and my opponent chose a very sharp line that gave me quite a few headaches as the game ensued.} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 {The Classical main line and one of the first historic attempts to refute the Gruenfeld. It's still seen with regular frequency in modern practice. White's idea is to place each piece on a very active and secure post, while trying to maintain the central pawn duo as it is.} O-O 8. Ne2 c5 {The standard plan for Black is to create pressure against the White centre, especially the d-pawn.} 9. O-O Nc6 10. Be3 Bg4 11. f3 {White's main idea behind this setup. He doesn't want to push either on of his central pawns and break the phalanx formation, otherwise Black's pieces will just use the central squares as outposts and play around White's pawns.} Na5 {Black's tactical idea is to use the loose position of the Bc4 to rearrange his pieces so as to hold the centre.} 12. Bd3 {12. Bxf7+ is still very much played and can be quite dangerous.} cxd4 {The point in delaying this move is very simple. Black wants to keep the c-file closed, as White won't be able to reply to 11...Na5 with 12. Rc1} 13. cxd4 Be6 {A very thematic position for the Gruenfeld but one that has slowly subsided from practice because of new discoveries in the Bronstein gambit, which starts with 14. d5. I'm not that concerned about it and I'm actually looking forward to playing against it, provided an opponents accommodates me, of course.} 14. Rc1 {An old idea, White sacrifices a pawn to hold the centre. The idea is to vacate the Rook from a1 so that White can play d5 and gain space.} Bxa2 {No need to be compliant, taking the pawn is relatively safe.} 15. Qa4 {The old variation starting with 15. d5 Bb3 16. Qd2 e6 17. Qb4 exd5 18. Rc5 Bc4 19. Rxa5 Bxd3 20. Rxd5 Bxe2 21. Rxd8 Rfxd8 has fallen out of favour since Black is the only one with real winning chances. This move tries to exploit the two Black pieces that are on the edge of the board. White definitely has pressure for the sacrificed pawn.} Bb3 {15...Be6 is way too cooperative. This is the best way to fight for the initiative.} 16. Qb4 {White still keeps the Queen on the Q-side to pressurize Black's position.} b6 {A bad positional move, since now there are weak squares on the Q-side for White to invade but there is no other decent way to untangle the Black pieces.} 17. Rc3 {A relatively new try and not a bad one at that. White's idea is to double Rooks and dominate the c-file. Note that because of weak white squares on the Q-side, Ba6 is possible in some lines, thus Black is forced to accept White's domination on the c-file.} Be6 {Forced, since White was threatening to exchange a Rook for two pieces.} 18. Rfc1 {White managed to double with tempo and already has ideas of infiltrating Black's 7th rank.} Qd6 {The theoretical recommendation and it served me pretty well in this game. Trying to simplify the position with 18...Rc8 19. Nf4 Qd6 20. Qxd6 exd6 21. Nxe6 Rxc3 22. Rxc3 fxe6 23. Bb5 leaves White with enough compensation for the pawn thanks to his Bishop pair and Black's weak pawn structure and bad Knight on a5.} 19. Qa4 {Avoiding the exchanges with good motive. After the Queen swap, Black can contest the c-file and reduce White's compensation to zero.} Bd7 {No time to wait and the more pieces are exchanged, the more the extra pawn will be felt.} 20. Bb5 {White exchanges my white square defender but it's all in order.} Bxb5 {Not accepting the exchange allows Rc7 and Black will slowly suffocate.} 21. Qxb5 a6 {This move gives me enough time to secure the 7th rank.} 22. Qa4 Ra7 {An ungainly move but necessary. If White is given time to play Rc7, d5 and Nd4, Black has no counterplay.} 23. Rc3c8 {An interesting try and directed against my last move. White wants to reduce the scope of play of my pieces to the absolute minimum.} Qd7 {I, in turn, use White's move to force the exchange of Queens and a pair of Rooks.} 24. Qxd7 Rxd7 25. Rxf8+ {25. d5 transposes after 25...b5. White must keep his remaining Rook active on the c-file before I play Nc4 and gain the upper-hand.} Bxf8 26. d5 {Perhaps 26. Rc8 was slightly more accurate, but this needs to be played eventually. White wants to use the extra space to get his pieces on ideal spots and generate more than enough initiative to recover the pawn.} b5 {With the idea of Nc4.} 27. Rc8 {Absolutely forced. Now the Rook can attack the Q-side pawns from behind, while at the same time keeping the Bf8 under lock and key.} Nb7 {Directed against White's matting net starting with Bh6. Now I could reply with Rd8 and force the exchange of Rooks. I also use the opportunity to get the Knight into play.} 28. Nd4 {A nice and obvious move. White activates his pieces by using his space advantage.} Rd8 {The best move. The White Rook was far too active on the last rank.} 29. Rc7 {Keeping the Rook active is an imperative. Now the Knight is attacked and I must decide what to do about it.} Na5 {This looks like a step back and maybe it is. 29...Nd6 was worth considering but I was in a greedy mood.} 30. Ra7 {30. Nc6 is a basic draw after 30...Nxc6 31. dxc6 e5 32. Ra7 b4 33. Rxa6 b3 34. Rb6 Rc8 35. Kf1 b2 36. Rxb2 Rxc6. My opponent was trying to win this.} Nc4 {As was I. The Knight finally arrived to c4 and I can breath a sigh of relief because I have a much better chance to hold on to the extra pawn now, even if that means suffering for a short time. OK, maybe not a short amount of time, but a pawn is a pawn and it beats suffering for nothing.} 31. Bg5 {White keeps playing aggressively and forcing me shut my own bishop in. The alternatives weren't much to look at however. After 31. Kf2 Rd6 32. Nc6 a6 33. Ra8 Nxe3 34. Kxe3 exd5 35. exd5 a5 36. Rb8 a4, Black has better long term prospects, provided he doesn't allow any exchange of pawns, which isn't an easy task by any measure.} f6 {A double-edge move because it restricts the Bf8 further and it also weakens e-pawn and the white squares on the K-side. The main advantage of it is that is forces the White Bishop to relinquish its very active post.} 32. Bc1 {Probably the best place to retreat. Now the Nc4 is kept under control and I'm not allowed to develop my Bishop on the c1-h6 diagonal. After the alternative 32. Bh4, I could have played 32...b5! (giving back the pawn to activate the pieces) 33. Nxb5 Rb8 34. Nd4 Bh6! and I have a good position all of a sudden.} a5 {The a-pawn was under attack and pushing it was the only way to defended it.} 33. Rc7 {A very good place to keep the Rook. White was smart to avoid restoring material balance with 33. Nxb5 because after 33...e6! the Ra7 is poorly placed and White must move to King in order to avoid an embarrassing double attack. Now I can't protect the b-pawn by advancing it because that leaves the Knight en-prise.} Ne5 {Retreating the Knight from the now insecure c4 square and preparing the b4 advance in case White doesn't take on b5 at once.} 34. Kf1 {An excellent move. My opponent is avoiding all the pitfalls with great skill. The King is brought close to the centre to avoid any back rank tricks and also traps on the dark squares. But why was the very natural looking 34. Nxb5 worse than this move? The reason is that after 34...e6, White can be lured into what seems like a dangerous attack starting with 35. Nd4 exd5 36. Ne6 Bd6 37. Rg7+ Kh8 38. Bh6 Re8 39. exd5 Re7 and the attack has stalled and the a-pawn is looking like it might just queen.} b4 {The intended and best move. The pawns are pretty advanced now but they are not yet very dangerous because White with his previous move has brought an excellent piece to supervise them, his King.} 35. Ke2 {Now the pawns don't seem so menacing and White can use his active pieces to either capture them or direct his threats elsewhere.} g5 {A very ugly move but I was under the impression that f4 followed by Nc6 is very powerful. The problem is that after this move, it will take extraordinary means to activate the lousy Bf8. A much better try was 35...Ra8 and after 36. f4 Nf7 37. Nc6 b3 White can choose between 38. Nxe7 Bxe7 39. Rxe7 a4 40. Ba3 Rb8 41. Bb2 a3 42. Bxa3 b2 43. Bxb2 Rxb2+ 44. Kf3 Rd2 with a very promising endgame and 38. e5 (a much better try) a4 39. Ba3 fxe5 40. fxe5 e6 41. d6 Nd8 42. Nxd8 Rxd8 43. Kd3 Rb8 with a complicated ending.} 36. Ra7 {Keeping the pressure on my pawns. The only drawback is that it allows me to activate my Rook.} Rc8 {What to do with the Bishop now?} 37. Be3 {An active looking move but perhaps 37. Kd1 was slightly better.} Nc4 {Now I can defend my pawns with tempo.} 38. Bf2 {Pretty forced. The active looking 38. Nc6 fails to 38...e5 39. Bf2 b3 40. Kd3 Nb2 41. Kc3 Nd1+ 42. Kxb3 Nxf2 43. Rxa5 and I'm sure I could have won this.} h5 {The point to this move is to prevent White from achieving a favourable pawn structure on the K-side, starting with g4.} 39. h3 {Inviting me to play 39...h4 and fix the pawn structure on the K-side but after which my Bf8 would effectively be locked in an iron cage. I had something else in mind.} f5 {A pawn sacrifice meant to activate my awful Bishop. Perhaps 39...h4 wasn't that bad, but I had had enough of playing with only two pieces.} 40. exf5 {Taking with the Knight leads to an almost forced variation after 40. Nxf5 b3 41. Bd4 a4 42. Rxa4 b2 43. Bxb2 Nxb2 44. Ra2 Rc2+ 45. Kf1 Rd2 46. Ra7 Nc4 47. Nxe7+ Bxe7 48. Rxe7 which is again a very complicated ending that both sides can try to win.} Rc5 {Over-protecting a5 and getting rid of the White's annoying d-pawn.} 41. Ne6 Rxd5 42. g4 {Fixing the pawn structure and threatening Ra8 which wasn't very good right now because of 42...Rxf5 43. Kd3 Nb2+ with an immediate draw. White is still bent on winning this. I love fighting chess.} hxg4 {I exchanged pawns on my weaker flank to lower White's prospects.} 43. fxg4 Bh6 {An odd looking place for the Bishop, but the g-pawn must not fall. I'm trying to win this, too, and the more natural looking 43...Ng7 would have almost forced White to draw with 44. Ra8+ Kh7 45. Nxg5+ Kh6 46. Nf7+ and so on.} 44. Bd4 {The drawback is that White can activate his Bishop.} b3 {Passed pawns must be pushed. I must act quick and generate enough threats before White weaves a matting net around my King.} 45. Ra8+ {The forceful 45. h4, trying to squeeze the mate in, fails after 45...Rxd4! (eliminating White's best piece, which was both attacking and defending at the same time) 46. Nxd4 b2 47. Rb7 gxh4 and there are too many runaway pawns for White to catch. The move played gives White time to bring the King closer to the connected pawns on the Q-side.} Kf7 46. Kd3 {The Knight is threatened. Where do you think it should go?} Na3 {A good place where Knight is safe and is eyeing the queening square of the b-pawn. 46...Ne5+ forces White to draw after 47. Ke4 Rxd4+ 48. Kd4 b2 and White must draw with the Knight checks because Rb8 fails to Nc6+. It's very interesting that the Black King cannot come to d7 because after Rd8+, he's forced to take the forking c6 square and that gives White enough time to win the b-pawn and the game. 46...Nd6 fails to 47. Rh8 and White has enough time to capture the Bh6 and stop the pawns from advancing too far.} 47. Rb8 {Put your Rook behind the most advanced pawn. That isn't an empty statement and it's the best way to play against connected pawns with a Rook.} a4 {What else?} 48. Ke4 {The King comes into the fray.} Rd7 {The Rook must stay on the d-file. Trying to play 48...Rb5 is thwarted by 49. Rh8! and mate is looming.} 49. h4 {The last try for a win. Trying to play slowly with something like 49. Bb2 can only lead to a disaster after 49...Nc4 50. Rh8 Nxb2 51. Rxh6 Rd6! 52. Nxg5+ Ke8 53. Ne6 Kd7 (53...Rxe6 only leads to a draw after 54. dxe6 Kf8 55. Rh8+ Kg7 56. Ra8 a3 57. Rxa3 Nc4 58. Ra8 b2 59. Rb8 b1Q 60. Rxb1 Nd2+ 61. Kf5 Nxb1 62. g5 Nc3 63. h4 Nb5 64. h5 and White holds his ground) 54. Rh8 Rxe6! (now this works) 55. fxe6+ Kxe6 56. Rh6+ Kf7 57. Rh7+ Kg6 58. Rxe7 a3 and the Black pawns triumph.  } Rxd4+ {The only move. This was the main reason why the Rook had to stay on the d-file. 49...gxh4 loses to 50. Bh8! followed by g5 and White's attack is very strong even with the reduced material on the board.} 50. Kxd4 {Taking with the Knight is worse because after 50...gxh4 51. Nxb3 h3! 52. Kf3 Nc2 53. g5! (worse is 53. Nc5 Ne1+ 54. Kg3 h2 55. Kxh2 Be5+ 56. Kh3 Bxb8 57. Nxa4 and it's a simple matter of technique to win this) Bxg5 54. Nc5 a3 ( 54...h2 is met by 55. Rh8, the point behind 53. g5!, the h-file is cleared with tempo) 55. Ra8 and the only one in danger of losing this is White.} gxh4 {Another passed pawn is born.} 51. g5 {If that pawn ever gets to g6 with tempo, the Black King is doomed.} Bg7+ {Try to play tricky intermediate moves like 51...Nc2+ is not recommended. After 52. Ke4 Bg7 53. g6+ (remember what I said a move earlier?) Kf6 54. Nxg7 Kxg7 55. Re8! and White will deliver a Queen first, despite all the passed Black pawns.} 52. Kc5 {The King has to come forward or else my King can escape and the pawns will win. For example after 52. Kd3 h3  53. Nd8+ Ke8 54. Ne6+ Kd7 55. Rd8+ Kc6 56. f6 ( trying to close the diagonal and catch the Q-side pawns with the King) exf6 57. Kc3 fxg5+! 58. Nxg7 Nb5+ 59. Kb2 Nd6 and there are too many pawns for White to keep tabs on all of them.} h3 {A slight inaccuracy that leaves me a bit worse but not without hope. 52...Nc2 was the better move, making room for the pawns to march in tandem. An interesting try is 53. g6+ Kf6 54. Nxg7 Kxg7 55. Re8! b2 56. Rxe7+ Kf6 (56...Kf8 loses outright to 57. f6 with mate to follow) 57. Rf7+ Ke5 58. Rb2 Nd4 59. Rxb2 Nxf5 60. Rf2 a3 61. Kb4 a2 61. Rxa2 Kf6 62. Ra6+ Kg7 63. Kc5 h3 and the pawnless ending is a dead draw. A very dangerous attempt is 53. Nd8+ Kg8 54. g6 Be5 55. Ra8 Kg7 56. Ne6+ Kh6 57. Rxa4 Kh5 58. g7 Bxg7 59. Nxg7+ Kg5 60. Ne6+ Kxf5 61. Nd4 Nxd4 62. Rxd4 with a draw also. The Rook can hold the pawns but it's not enough to capture them all.} 53. Nd8+ Kg8 {The only move. Ke8 doesn't work now because there is no escape through d7 anymore.} 54. Ne6+ Kf7 55. Nd8+ {Repeating the position, not a problem in CC, but in OTB it can have a psychological effect on your opponent, who might just crack under pressure and deviate with a worse move.} Kg8 56. g6 {Threatening mate with Ne6.} Be5 {The only move. It prevents a very nasty discovered check, it forces the Rook of the b-file or the 8th rank, it makes room for the King to escape and it prepares to advance the h-pawn. Talk about doing multiple things at once. I'd just like to add a small opinion of mine. When there are advanced passed pawns on both flanks, or more generally, there is heavy play on both flanks, a Bishop comes very close to the value of a Rook because it can focus fire, defend, blockade on both sides of the board and sometimes all of that at once.} 57. Ra8 {The only move for White, as well. Playing 57. Rc8 suddenly loses after 57...Kg7 58. Ne6+ Kh6 59. Kd5 (forcing the Bishop from its over-active post in the middle of the board) Bb2! (guarding against Rc1) 60. g7 (otherwise White has to sit and what the h-pawn queening) Bxg7 61. Rc1 b2! ( advancing with tempo) 62. Rh1 Kh5 (White was threatening mate) 63. Rxh3+ Kg4 and Black will soon have a full fledge Queen on his hands.} Kg7 {Forced or else mate follows.} 58. Ne6+ {Again the only move. Trying to change the move order loses because after 58. Rxa4 h2 59. Ne6+ and Black can play Kf6 because there is no mate on f8 anymore.} Kh6 {Again the only move, as mentioned earlier Kf6 gets the King mated with Rf8.} 59. Rxa4 {After an incredible long struggle, White finally gets to capture at least one of the troublesome passed pawns. Again, this is the only move that keeps White in the game. Trying to play something like 59. Kd5 gets clobbered by 59...Nc4 and the Black Bishop is the star of the show.} Bf6 {Again, the only move. Mate was threatened on h4. This Bishop is sure making up for the lost time in the earlier part of the game, when it was the worst piece on the board.} 60. g7 {Not forced anymore, but the best try. White wants to make a Queen for himself as well.} Kh7 {60...Bxg7?? 61. Rh4#. The King is the only piece that can catch the pawn.} 61. Rg4 {White is still determined to queen that pawn.} Bxg7 {The shortest way to splitting the point after an arduous battle. The awesome Bishop sacrifices itself for White's most dangerous pawn.} 62. Rxg7+ {Taking with the Knight loses to 62...b2. White must still be careful.} Kh8 {But so must I. After 62...Kh6 63. Rg3, the threat of mate gives White just enough time to capture all the pawns and use his last remaning soldier to bring home the point.} 63. Rxe7 {The game is almost drawn now. White munches one more for the road.} b2 64. Re8+ Kh7 65. Ng5+ Kg7 66. Re1 {There won't be enough mating material left on the board after 66...b1Q 67. Rxb1 Nxb1 68. Nxh3 Kf6, so draw was agreed at this point. A very difficult and sharp endgame that was like walking a tightrope that is set aflame behind you.}
