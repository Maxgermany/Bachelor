1. d4 {Hi everyone!  So, no doubt you have all been wondering just where Henry and Glenda have got to and had no doubt thought you had seen the back of Old Matey.  Well, it's just that I have been soooo busy lately with my huge games workload which is gradually diminishing and other things.  However, here I am again.  This time, after 3 losses against Davide, I managed to open my account against him with a Low Draw.  I think it is a pretty rare endgame though.  Even though at the end I was a pawn down, I managed to draw it because it was a side pawn and my opponent had the wrong colour bishop.  So how did this happen?  Well, read on ........} d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 c5 {3.  ....... c5 - after a double queen pawn opening and both sides getting minor pieces out quickly, I decided to deflect the d4 pawn opening up the possibility of e5 at a later date.} 4. c3 Qb6 {4. ...... Qb6 - whey-hey! Just look who has come to defend that c5 pawn, why it's no one other than Glenda!  However, she is also attacking something.  Can you see what?} 5. Qc2 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nc6 7. Nxc6 bxc6 {7. ..... bxc6 - a plethora of exchanges has taken place.  My a pawn has become isolated.  I just hope that will not be too much of a handicap later on in the game.} 8. Be3 c5 9. g3 e6 10. Bg2 Bb7 {10. ...... Bb7 - Fou Leblanc contests the a8-h1 diagonal.} 11. O-O Be7 {11. ..... Be7 - I now clear the decks and Henry is ready to castle.  As the kingside looks undisturbed I think he should go there, although I must keep my eye on the Wicked Witch of the West who has plonked herself on c2 and is eyeing up h7, which is another fav. square for Old Matey to reside on.} 12. a4 Qc7 13. Na3 a6 {13. ...... a6 - a prophylactic move - no white knight can land on b5 - at least for the nonce.} 14. f3 O-O 15. b4 cxb4 16. cxb4 Qxc2 17. Nxc2 Rac8 {17. ....... Rac8 - after another plethora of exchanges I decide to stick a rook on c8.  Rooks just lurve those open files!} 18. Rfc1 Rc4 19. b5 axb5 20. axb5 {20. axb5 - the good news is - I have got rid of my isolani on the a file.  The bad news is, Davide has a passer on b5 and an open file for his QR!} Bc5 21. Bxc5 Rxc5 {21. ....... Rxc5 - bishop trade.} 22. Nd4 Rxc1+ 23. Rxc1 {23. Rxc1 - rook trade.} Rc8 24. Ra1 Ra8 25. Rxa8+ Bxa8 {25. ...... Bxa8 - the final major pieces have been traded off.  Now, just how powerful is that white queenside passer gonna be?  Will that bally witch reappear or has Davide overplayed is hand with the pawn?  Que sera sera!} 26. Nc6 Bxc6 27. bxc6 {27. bxc6 - this B for N trade has brought the pawn one step closer to Henry.  Trouble is, he is gonna have to abandon the kingside pawns to round it up!} Ne8 {27. ..... Ne8 - only move to stop it in its tracks.} 28. e4 Nc7 29. e5 {29. e5 - crimp.} Kf8 30. Kf2 Ke7 31. Ke3 {31. Ke3 - as Henry moves towards his favourite repast, Davide's king also moves towards the centre.} Nb5 32. f4 Na7 33. Kd4 Nxc6+ {33. ..... Nxc6+ - the pawn has been hovered up and I am a pawn up and I ought to win.  However, the WK has advanced into my arc and even with a pawn up, defeat cannot be ruled out.} 34. Kc5 Kd7 35. Bf1 Kc7 {35. .... Kc7 - ho hum, would Ne7 have been better?  You the Inquest Jury decide!} 36. Bd3 h6 {36. ...... h6 - g6 perhaps?} 37. Bb5 Nd8 38. Be8 f6 39. f5 {39. f5!! - this is a brilliancy which leads to me having to concede a Low Draw - whichever way I capture, I will not be able to hold on to my one point advantage.} Nb7+ 40. Kd4 fxe5+ 41. Kxe5 exf5 42. Kxd5 {42. Kxd5 - not Kxf5?? - which was what I was hoping for.  If Davide had played that I would have played Nd6+ forking king and bishop.} g5 43. Ke5 f4 44. gxf4 gxf4 45. Kxf4 {45. Kxf4 - and now white equalizes and the h pawn is about to fall.  However, it really is fortunate that Henry, despite being in his sixties, is still pretty agile and will manage to make a frantic dash to h8 in time.  Even if my knight falls, white cannot win because he has the wrong coloured bishop!} Nd6 46. Bg6 Kd8 47. Kg4 Ke7 {47. ...... Ke7 - huff ....} 48. Kh5 Kf8 {38. ..... Kf8 - puff!} 49. Kxh6 Kg8 {49. ..... Kg8 - wheeze .......} 50. h4 Kh8 {50. ..... Kg8 - MADE IT!  WHEEEW AND DOUBLE WHEEEW!  After Henry is safely ensconced on h8, he bends over and puts his hands on his knees, just like we girls were taught to do in our PE lessons after going for a 400m jog round the athletics track at school!  There is no way Davide can crown that h pawn, even if I lost my knight, because his bishop does not command h8, the best he can achieve is the wrong kind of mate.  Ho hum - even though my rating has dropped a further 3.5 points, at least I can take heart from the fact that being 3.5 - 0.5 down looks a little better than 3-0 down and is quite an improvement on my 3 other games with him!  Anyhow, tomorrow is another day ........ so goodnight for now folks!}
