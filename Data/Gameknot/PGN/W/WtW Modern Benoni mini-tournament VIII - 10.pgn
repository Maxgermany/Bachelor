1. d4 {Comments warmly welcomed, of course and thanks to caveman53 for this interresting game.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. g3 {A variation I didn't know.} g6 {Black carries on main Benoni line.} 7. Bg2 {Fiancheto} Bg7 {Main line} 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O {It's quite for the moment.} Re8 {Still following the main line, developping quietly.} 10. Nd2 {Surely to prepare e4 and to bring the knight on c4 to menace d6. So white prepares a central attack. } a6 {To prevent 11. Nb5 and prepare 11. ... b5 preventing 12. Kc4} 11. a4 {Preventing b5} Nbd7 {It blocks the LSB but permits Ne5or Nb3} 12. h3 {Probably a mistake, weakening the kingside to prevent Ng4 which wasn't that dangerous.} Ne5 {Black lances the attack at the center. The plan is to take control of it.} 13. f4 {Forcing the knight to withdraw but opening the kingside a bit more.} Ned7 {Black  has to withdraw but the plan is now to attack the g and h pawns.} 14. e4 {Whjte's on attack at the center as well.} b6 {I do not remember why I did this move which is of very little interest. Probably to enable Bb7 which has not much interest either.} 15. Nc4 Qc7 {To protect the d pawn without moving the d knight.} 16. Re1 {Whit still prepares his attack at the center} Nh5 {To unblock my pièces who where totally cramped by white's pawn advance and accentuate the weakness on white's king side. Of course the knight would be quycky fired but f6 seemed to me a proper place for the brave lancelot.} 17. Kh2 Rb8 {To protect the b pawn and permit the queen and the d knght to leave their post.} 18. g4 {Mistake, white's kingside is even weaker.} Nhf6 {The knight has no escape in case of an attack but it doesn't need any, for the brave Lancelot is prepared to give his life for his king.} 19. e5 {So, blood has to flow.} Nxg4+ {?! If white takes with the queen, he'll be quickly in trouble and have an isolated pawn. taking with the pawn give him 2 pawns advance but a serious weakness on the king side and, most important, it gives me the advantage on the center, so that I'm almost sure to get at least one pawn so that white will have two isolated pawns and black will have the initiative. The bargain seemed ok... But I have been wrong so often that I possibly oversee something. Of course, the death of Lancelot the brave  charging in the melee with no support will be the price to pay.} 20. hxg4 {White opts to take with the pawn.} dxe5 {Now, black should take control of the center and decimate white's kingside pawns.} 21. d6 {The weak point of black's plan.} Qd8 {Menacing 17. Qh4+ and black still has 3 pieces protecting e5 which is enough.} 22. fxe5 {White's idea is to protect the passed d pawn but the white's king is in a even weaker position.} Nxe5 {Better than 22. ... Be5+ as it frees the LSB menacing 23. ... BXg4 or 23. ... NXg4+ So that white is almost forced to take.} 23. Nxe5 {White takes} Qh4+ {23. ... NXe5+ was another candidate move but this seems more offensive because  if 24. ... NXe5, the h2 square is undercontrol of both black queen and  DSB and if 24. ... Bg4, the white queen is under direct menace. So that black has more attacking possibilities with this option.} 24. Kg1 {Forced move (if 24. Bh3 RXe5 25. RXe5 BXe5+ 26.Kg1 QXh3 with mating menace.} Bxe5 {There were several options (24.... Bg4 24. ... Re5 25. ... Bd4+) and I'm not sure at all to have chosen the best one.} 25. Rxe5 {White takes which is almost forced move.} Rxe5 {Now black has regain his lost piece and a bit more since he has the material advantage and positional as well although white's d pawn is dangerous.} 26. Bf4 {White counterattacks and his rook protects the queen in cas of 30.Re1+} Bxg4 {This move seemed to me the winning one but didn't hold all his promises.} 27. Qxg4 Qxg4 28. Bxe5 {Black is ahead in material and his king is in safer but with the many lower pièces, white can afford trading so that black has to be very carefull, expecially because with his passed pawn black could force an exchange. Here, white is fairly cramped : can Harly move the knight, LSB is pinned, rook protects the DSB. The only piece white can move safely is the DSB. Anyway, the situation is pretty complicated and the first who does the mistake loses.} Qg5 29. Re1 {Black can quickly be in a very dangerous situation if white manages to set his rook on e8 and his pawn on d7 (black has to take it by RXe8 and is mate by dXe8 with pawn promotion. It's a rather common mating situation.} Rd8 {preventing 30. d7 which seemed the most important menace.} 30. Nd5 {Pretty dangerous situation for black with mating menace, passed pawn on the 6th line and forks attack possibilities from the knight.} Qh4 {It seemed the best way to prevent 31. Bf6 with fork attack against queen and rook and still keep a control on the h4 d8 diagonal.} 31. Re4 Qg5 {It has almost the same interest than the last move. If 32. Bf6 Qc1+ 33. Kh2 RXd6} 32. Nf6+ Kg7 33. Nh5+ {I'm not sure it's the best move (for it leads to the win of the black queen against knight, bishop and the d pawn. May be white should have plaid 33. Nd7 to take the b pawn for black could hardly move a piece without being in danger.} Kh6 34. Bf4 {So, black exchanged a knight vs a queen and white does the same. Justice.} Kxh5 {First, getting some compensation for the queen} 35. Bxg5 {Probably the best move....} Kxg5 {Black has lost  his material advantage.} 36. Bf1 Rxd6 37. Bxa6 {White proposes a draw and I hesitated. Caveman is a stronger player tha I am. As for the situation : material equality, both rooks are on the center on open files. Black has 3 pawns on the same color than the white bishop. The black king is near the center and can protect his pawns. GK computer gives white ahead. I wanted to see what could happen and I saw an interesting line.} Rd2 {Menacing the b pawn and blocking the white king on line 1 but abandoning the b and c pawns to their doom.} 38. b3 h5 {Black's plan is to advance his king and pawn on the left wing to trap the white king and oblige white to exchange his knight and/or rook against a pawn. But it is not a very good move. I didn't play 38. ... f5  to prevent as long as possible white to play Re6. But I had oversaw that after f5; the g pawn would have to be protected by the king. I think 38. ... h6 would have been better or even 38. ... f5. 39. Re6 Kg4.} 39. Bc4 {White attacks the unprotected pawn.} f5 40. Re6 {There I saw that 38. ... h5 was a mistake., for I cannot advance the king without having my g pawn taken. And the plan to trap white's king won't work with isolated pawns.} f4 {So that I have to advance the f pawn.} 41. Rxb6 {White's plan is to take on the queen side to have his pawns passed.} Kf5 {Black has to advance the g pawn and doesn't want to set his king on the h file, for it's better to stay at the center.} 42. Rc6 g5 {At last I could push the g pawn but I could have spare at least one move for this result. At least, all my pawns are one or two squares ahead but at the price of one pawn. If 43. RXc5+ Kg4} 43. Be6+ {To prevent Kg4} Ke4 {It's not a bad place for the king. The most important is to advance.} 44. Rxc5 g4 {I have to sacrify another pawn but white has to fear a mate in 2 now if the black king comes on g3} 45. Rxh5 {White's now one bishop ahead but I still hoped that black's position would compensate it. I offered a draw which white refused.} g3 {To carry on pushing and to prevent RXh2} 46. Bg4 {I felt quite unsafe for black could now afford to exchange the rooks and have an easy win. and the black rook cannot come on d1 any longer.} Rb2 {Menacing Rb1+ or RXb3} 47. a5 {Only three more steps and the white pawn is promoted.} Rb1+ {I decided to force the draw. by menacing perpetual check for if the white's king leaves his corner, black will promote his g pawn in two moves and white needs 3 moves to do the same. } 48. Kg2 {White offers draw and black accepts for If 45. Kg2 Rb2+ 46. Kg1 Rb1+ etc... If 45. f3 KXf3  46. Rf5+ 47 Kg4 Rb5.  If 45. RXb3 a6 and the white tower can move move to  protect the pawn. May be there was a way to win but I didn't find it.}
