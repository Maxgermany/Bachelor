[Round "1"]
[White "Dr. Max Euwe "]
[Black "Aleksander Alekhine "]
[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Keres defence"]

1. d4 e6 {this was the 26th game of the match, and Euwe was leading one point ahead; if he would win this game in this 30-game match, he would be almost sure of winning the match...} 2. c4 f5 3. g3 Bb4+ 4. Bd2 {a gross oversight by Alekhine: trying to pull off the Dutch Defense against the Dutch champion... best now, is Bxd2+, Qxd2, Nf6, Bg2, 0-0, Nf3, d6, 0-0, Qe8, and just sit and wait...} Be7 5. Bg2 Nf6 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Nf3 Ne4 8. O-O b6 9. Qc2 Bb7 10. Ne5 {slightly sharper would have been 9. Nxe4 fxe4, 10. Ne5, but both giants are taking this easy... (note: whites' KN just went on a formidable journey across the board; move count = 2)} Nxc3 11. Bxc3 Bxg2 12. Kxg2 Qc8 {Alekhine does not seem to feel very comfortable in this modern style type of opening play; he is fishing in murky waters, and already behind in development...} 13. d5 d6 14. Nd3 e5 15. Kh1 c6 16. Qb3 Kh8 17. f4 e4 18. Nb4 c5 19. Nc2 Nd7 20. Ne3 {slowly but surely, Alekhine is getting a firm grip on this game; White has no advantages left, and the next move might grant a slight edge for Black... (note: count = 6)} Bf6 {after Bxf6, Nxf6, h3, Nh5, Black is firmly back in the saddle; but he hasn't counted on Euwe's reply...} 21. Nxf5 Bxc3 22. Nxd6 Qb8 23. Nxe4 {the smoke is clearing; White took 3 pawns for the black squared bishop, and gained a slight edge after Bd4, Ng5, Qd6, e4, Qg6... (note: count = 9)} Bf6 {tries to tempt White into trading his strong Knight; not today...} 24. Nd2 g5 {clearly underestimating the gravity of his situation; best is a6, e4, Bd4...} 25. e4 gxf4 26. gxf4 Bd4 27. e5 {countering Qd6 followed by Qg6; all of a sudden, Black is confronted with three connected free pawns, with his Bishop shut in; other than that is Rae1 becoming a potent threat...} Qe8 28. e6 {obviously trying to avoid the capture of e5, with two pawns against a piece; a bit tougher was Qh3, b5, Rae1, or straightaway Rae1...} Rg8 {preparing Qg6, at the cost of Nd7...} 29. Nf3 {but White does not take the bait, covering for g1 in the process...} Qg6 30. Rfg1 Bxg1 31. Rxg1 Qf6 {Alekhines first real mistake; after Qf5, exd7, Rxg1+, Kxg1, Qxf4 or Qxd7, Black can keep up with the loss of material... now - once again, the cavalry rolls in...} 32. Ng5 Rg7 {we wouldn't like Nf7+ at all... (note: count = 12)} 33. exd7 Rxd7 {maybe Qxf4 works better...} 34. Qe3 {Euwe is missing an opportunity with Ne6, Re8, Qc3, or directly Qc3, to get rid of the Queens; but he goes about it differently...} Re7 35. Ne6 Rf8 {after Qxb2, d6, Rd7, Nc7, Rad8, Black is better prepared for what is coming; or maybe directly Rae8, followed by Rxe6...} 36. Qe5 {a bit soon: White had still time for b3, a3, b4 and such...} Qxe5 37. fxe5 Rf5 {better straightaway Rxe6, dxe6, Rf5, Re1, Kg7...} 38. Re1 h6 {also here Rxe6, dxe6, Kg7, Re3, Kf8 or at least Kg8, Re3, Rxe6, dxe6, Kf8 were much needed; again Alekhine underestimates the Dutch cavalry...} 39. Nd8 {of course Rxe5, Rxe5, Rxe5, fails on Nf7+...} Rf2 {but this is no better either; Re8, Nc6, Rf2 looks safer...} 40. e6 Rd2 41. Nc6 Re8 42. e7 b5 {this move was needed much earlier in the game...} 43. Nd8 Kg7 44. Nb7 Kf6 45. Re6+ Kg5 {safer Kg7...} 46. Nd6 Rxe7 47. Ne4+ {Euwe finishes it off in style; with probably the busiest Knight on the planet for modern understandings... Alekhine never knew what hit him and resigned: and won the next game to no avail; after three conclusive draws, Euwe became the first and only ever Dutch Word Champion of Chess... final note: the KN move count in this game amounts to 19 moves out of 47; let's say 2 out of every 5 moves... that is why this game is ranking among the then greats; we Dutch call this The Pearl of Zandvoort...}
