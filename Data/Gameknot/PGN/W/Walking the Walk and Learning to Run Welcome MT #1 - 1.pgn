1. e4 e6 {1....c5 is statistically the best.The Sicilian Defence puts a greater premium on tempo than other replies to 1.e4.I however as I"ve aged I prefer a slower game even giving up opening 1.e4.} 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 {The Exchange Variation of the French defence.Though it has been played by kasparov on occasion it came as a bit of a surprise from my higher rated opponent.More principled and aggressive are 3.Nc3 3.e5 3.Nd2.The gameknot data base also prefers the other moves.} exd5 4. Nf3 Bd6 5. c4 c6 6. Nc3 Ne7 7. Bd3 dxc4 8. Bxc4 O-O 9. O-O Nd7 10. h3 {I'm out of book now though though I see 10.h3 is in the gameknot database with a massive % W/B/= 58/11/29  in whites favour. } Nb6 11. Bb3 Nbd5 12. Nxd5 {12.N!?White gives black an isolated Q pawn as well and fixes the central P structure. 12.Re1 & 12.Bg5 are in the GK database} Nxd5 13. Bxd5 cxd5 14. Bd2 {14.Bg4 is met by 14....f6 a thematic move for black in the French exchange.} Qb6 {Activating the Queen in preperation for uniting the Rooks.It also fixes whites N to protecting the d pawn ans threatens the b pawn.} 15. Bc3 {I look forward to seeing the GK computers evaluation of this move and feedback from the Masters.I don't like this move and think it may be an inaccuracy by white.I prefer 15.b3} Bf5 {Seeking active squares for my pieces.Just about here I was quite satisfied with my position.Black has at least a =/+.The position also fits my style better than my other game against Jo where I had a definite white plus out of the opening in a very complicated position.} 16. Nh4 {Expected.After blacks best reply 16....Bd7 I hope it proves to be a loss of tempo.} Bd7 17. Re1 Rfe8 {17...Rfe8, contesting the efile. Also preparing f8 for the bishopin the event of a white incursion into f5. Its about here that I decided I might have the possibility to win against Jo so I decided to switch from a fast moving tempo to correspondence mode like my esteemed opponent. Though the position looks potentially drawish : (fixed & symetrical pawn positions, equal centre control, safe k positions and equally contested e file with potential multiple Rook exchanges). We do have a minor piece imbalance. N/B V Bishop pair though the fixed centre tends to balance them out. Blacks plan will be to try and provoke weakness on both sides of the board in the hope of utilizing his B pair. Whites plan to exchange down to a Q/N v Q/B ending where white has the superior piece combination.} 18. Qd2 {18,Qd2. Joining the Rooks. And also threatening the Ba5 and Qg5.  } Bc7 {18...Bc7 countering Ba5 and allowing Blacks Queen lateral defensive/offensive options along the 6th rank.} 19. Rxe8+ {I consider this a slight mistake by white as the plan chosen by white leads to the exchange of the major pieces giving black what he wants.Better minor pieces and a low risk position where he gets the chance to grind away at whites position.I think 19.Nf3 was better than if 19....Bf5 than 20.Nh4 seeing if black is ready to repeat positions for the draw.} Rxe8 20. Re1 Rxe1+ {Avoiding this exchange would favour white.} 21. Qxe1 Qe6 {!! Played as a winning attempt and not trading down for a draw against my higher rated opponent.} 22. Qxe6 Bxe6 {fxe only gives black a weak P on e6 and decreases the mobility of the WSB.} 23. Kf1 g5 {Played to gain space  and with the f6 follow up to deny whites knight anchor points in the centre.} 24. Nf3 f6 25. Nd2 Kf7 26. Ke2 {In the endgame the King is a fighting piece.I recall that I read somewhere that in the endgame it has the same valuation as a minor piece.Any comment from the mentors?} h5 {Again gaining space and also aiming to play h4 fixing whites pawns to the white squares.} 27. f3 {I think Jo played this to discourage g4 by black or hoping for multiple pawn exchanges on g4.} h4 {Sticking with the plan of trying to create weaknesses on both sides of the board for the greater mobility of the bishops to exploit.The k side has been weakened now black has to create a weakness on whites Q-side.} 28. a3 {I don't like this move as I think white unnecessarily weakens her Q-side.I think b3 may have been better or perhaps leave the pawns as they are at the moment and play Ke3.} Bd6 {Played to prevent Bb4 by white but also bettering its own placement as the BSB now bears down on both wings. The alternative plan which I looked at (28.......a5 29.b4 a4 ) may have been better,Any comment from the mentors?} 29. Nb3 {Looking for activity by probing on the Qside} b6 {Again denying the white knight outpost points in the centre,this time c5.} 30. Nd2 {Back to the position of move 29 except for the P on b6 for black and it being blacks move.I think this sequence has favoured black as I don't see b6 as a weakness and its a move to be played in many variations.} Bd7 {Repositioning the WSB so it now covers both sides of the board,also preventing a4 by white and preparing  for Bb5 at some stage and exploiting the a6-f1 diagonal and the white weak k=side pawn structure.If white should manage to get in Nf3 attacking the pawn on d5 black now has e6 for his king protecting the pawn.} 31. Nf1 Bb5+ 32. Kf2 a5 {Gaining space on the Q-side} 33. Bd2 {A stellar defensive move, Changing whites bishop from a pawn". White activates the Bishop and eyes blacks K-side.} Ke6 34. Be3 Bd3 35. Ke1 b5 36. Bd2 b4 37. axb4 Bxb4 {After the game I thought 37...axb was better keeping the bishop on.} 38. Bxb4 axb4 39. Ne3 f5 {Taking away g4 from the N} 40. Nf1 Bb5 41. Nd2 Ba4 {Black seeing no way to make any headway offered the draw which was accepted}
