[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {This opening goes by a variety of names (Reti is the one I've encountered most frequently), or sometimes by no name at all--1.Nf3 is a transpositional move, used in a variety of ways to avoid certain lines (generally those including an early ...e5) in other common openings. In this game, for example, White wants to play the English, but avoid a reversed-Sicilian (1.c4 e5).} c5 {More popular are 1...Nf6 and 1...d5. With this move Black offers a transition to the main-line Sicilian (after 2.e4).} 2. c4 {But White was intending to play the English, so now we have a Symmetrical English opening instead.} Nf6 3. g3 d5 {Black makes a claim for the center before White's King's Bishop can get in the game, aiming at d5. The game still has a large amount of transpositional potential; the move order is not critical. White will continue to attack the center from the wings, while Black seeks to occupy it directly.} 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. cxd5 {It may be stronger to play 5.Bg2 first, but this move is coming sooner or later.} Nxd5 6. Nxd5 Qxd5 7. Bg2 e5 {Black now has a solid foothold in the center. Even his Queen is not trivial to harass right away, as the loss of White's QN restricts his options--only the Bg2 is available to attack the Queen, and that only via moving his Knight to a much more marginal location (either Nh4 or (after castling) Ng5-h3 (after Black's Queen's retreat and ...h6)).} 8. O-O Be7 9. Qc2 {Both sides have continued to develop logically, though White's untouched d-pawn is cramping his QB needlessly-- I think 9.d3 would have been stronger here, freeing the bishop, preventing ...e4 and allowing the White Knight to threaten a jump to g5 after 10.Qc2.} e4 {Black creates space and forces the White Knight to make a tough decision.} 10. Ne1 {I think 10.Nh4 is probably better, but it's understandable that White doesn't want to let Black weaken his castle with 10...Bxh4 11.gxh4. The Knight also has an easy-looking redeployment to d3 if White can get rid of the e-pawn, on d3 or e4.} f5 {Black supports his overextended e-pawn. Now he needs to find time to get his Queen out of that pin and free the e-pawn to move, before White manages to win it.} 11. d3 Nd4 {Black does not have any other defenders for e4, but he can drive away an assailant.} 12. Qd1 {Attempting to maintain the pressure on e4 with 12.Qb1? fails against 12...Nxe2+.} O-O 13. b3 b5 14. Bb2 Rb8 {Getting off the long diagonal and preparing ...Bb7, for the inevitable moment when the BQ needs to leave the h1-a8 diagonal.} 15. Qd2 {I'm not sure about the intent behind this move. The Queen doesn't threaten anything new from d2, and if the point is to defend b2, it could wait until something actually threatened the Bishop.} Bb7 16. Nc2 {Preparing to win a pawn by starting a bloodbath in the center.} h6 {? Threatening ...Bg5, complicating White's attack, but hanging a center pawn in the process. The defensive 16...Bf6 was probably better here.} 17. Nxd4 cxd4 18. dxe4 {Less about taking the pawn than opening the d-file.} fxe4 19. Rfd1 {Black cannot hold the d4 pawn now, and when it falls, e4 will be isolated and weak.} Qf5 {Black finally breaks the pin, maintaining control of e4 for now and putting pressure on f2.} 20. Bxd4 Bf6 21. Bxf6 Rxf6 22. Qd4 {The most active way to defend f2.} Rbf8 {Black piles on, but White has more than enough defense.} 23. Rdf1 a6 {As Black has no way to threaten f2 further, he pulls his lagging pawn out of the WQ's gaze.} 24. Rac1 {Preparing an obnoxious presence on the seventh rank.} Qg4 {Threatening e2, but more to the point, allowing the Rooks to take the lead down the f-file and defending g7 for the inevitable attack via Rc7 and Qa7.} 25. Rc7 Ba8 {Not the best place for a Bishop, but it must not leave the h1-a8 diagonal or the e-pawn falls and the WB enters the game to devastating effect. 25...Bc6 is ineffective, as White simply plays 26.Qb6 and the Bishop must retreat to a8 anyway.} 26. Qa7 {Now the BQ cannot leave her defense of g7, or mate follows in short order.} h5 {Black must create counterplay if he is going to survive this attack. Trying to defend g7 with a Rook loses the Bishop and the game soon after (26...R6f7 27.Rxf7 Rxf7 28.Qxa8+ Rf8 29.Qxe4), so aggression is the best viable alternative.} 27. Rd1 {?? I think this move almost singlehandedly loses the game for White. Driving the BQ back and away first with 27.h3 Qg6 may be safe, and certainly would not be worse. This move allows the Black Rooks to drive into the heart of White's kingdom with their Queen right nearby for support, and the attack is actually much deadlier than White imagines.} Rf6xf2 {?! If White now blindly continues his plan to batter down the seventh rank, Black wins: 28.Rdd7?? Rxg2+! 29.Kxg2 Qxe2+ 30.Kh3 Qf1+ 31.Kh4 g5+ 32.Kxh5 Qh3+ 33.Kxg5 Rf5+ 34.Kg6 Qh5# (White can hold out somewhat longer with 33.Kg6 but his position remains hopeless).} 28. Bf3 {White cannot allow ...Rxg2+! in this situation, and this move carries a surprising sting: 28...exf3 29.Qxf2 fxe2?? (thinking to win the Rook with tempo) 30.Qxf8+! Kxf8 31.Rd8#. So Black must continue another way, with 29...h4 or 29...Qg5-e5 instead, leading to an unclear position.  28.Rf1 is no good as 28...Rxg2+! still wins. Also ineffective is trying for an "even" exchange with 28.Qxf2, which should be a clear win for Black after 28...Rxf2 29.Kxf2 e3+! 30.Kf1 Bxg2+ 31.Kxg2 Qxe2+ 32.Kh3 Qxd1 and Black will soon promote for an overwhelming QQ vs R ending.  The best chance I see for White is 28.Bh3, driving the Queen away from her ridiculously powerful post on g4 and defending g2 against the Rook. 28.Re1 might barely hold as well, but the Bishop move is much stronger, I think.} exf3 {?! 28...R2xf3 29.exf3 exf3 30.Rd2 is probably safer for Black, avoiding the dangerous line mentioned earlier.} 29. Rdd7 {?? Failing to play 29.Qxf2 here is catastrophic. Black has his choice of winning moves now.} Rf1+ {0-1. After this sacrifice, White will lose in five more moves (30.Kxf1 fxe2+ 31.Ke1 Rf1+ 32.Kd2 e1=Q+ 33.Kc2 Rf2+ 34.Rd2 Qxd2+ 35.Kb1 Qb2#) and resigns. Two moves faster was 29...Rg2+ 30.Kf1 fxe2+ 31.Ke1 Qb4+ 32.Rc3 Qxc3+ 33.Rd2 Rf1#, but I missed that at the time. Besides, the Rook sacrifice is showier ;-)  Thanks very much to delgado1971 for this excellent game!
