1. Nf3 Nf6 2. e3 {the move 2.e3 is harmless move for both sides , some say it because it helps white develop his LSB but if white wants to take over the center he should play moves like 2.c4 , d4, extra extra ....} g6 3. b3 Bg7 4. Bb2 O-O 5. c4 b6 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. Be2 c5 {Black could equal the position by playing 7...d5 and after 8.Nxd5-Nxd5.9.Bxg7-Kxg7.10.cxd5-Qxd5.11.d4 the position is totally equal that's for black decided to prevent that silent continuation and starts to complex the things .} 8. O-O Nc6 9. d4 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Nxd4 11. Qxd4 {good move , if 11.exd-d5.12.Bf3-Qd7 and black starts to get pressure on whites center pawns .} Ne4 12. Qd3 d6 13. Bf3 f5 14. Rab1 Nc5 15. Qd2 {Until now white played logical and good moves , but now his good judgements fails , it was necessary to defend his bishop on f3 by plying 15.Qe2.} Bxf3 16. gxf3 f4 {Good move !, white missed that 16...f4! , if 17.exf -Qd7! and evatuly black is going to get back the pawn he lost with clear better position . } 17. Nd5 e5 {Good move , the idea of 17.e5! is to open the diagonal d8-h4 for his queen and by the same time it closes temporally whites strong a1-h8 strong diagonal .} 18. exf4 Qh4 {with the idea of maneuvering tho rook to f5 and than to h5 and white going to be in serious trouble .} 19. Kh1 Qh3 20. Qe2 {20.Qe2? a mistake that destroys whites attempts to save the game , it was necessary for white to play 20.Qd1!-Rae8! and black with the upper hand but the war is fare from over .} Rae8 21. Rbe1 e4 {strong move ! white probably didn't see it coming , the threat is clear exf and than checkmate the white king and the queen is under attack on the same time . how white is going to stop the attack without losing large material , its seems that winning for black is now matter of simple technique } 22. Rfg1 Bxb2 23. Rg3 Qh4 24. Rg4 {now black ends the game quick , 24.Qxb2 is usless because of 24...Nd3 winning the exchange with total winning position for black . white is lost .} exf3 25. Qxe8 Qxg4 {white resigns .}
