1. e4 {e4! What a surprise!} d5 {Ooh - my opponent replies with the Scandinavian Defence. } 2. exd5 {So I take.} Nf6 {The most common move is 2. ... Qxd5, is it not? But Nf6 is OK.} 3. Nc3 {Nc3, one of many common moves.} Bf5 {Bf4: again, still common.} 4. d4 {d4! Is this a little bit on the stubborn side, maybe?} c5 {c5?? Apparently, my opponent does not want my d4 pawn to be on the d4 square.} 5. dxc5 {So I take.} e6 {e6? I can see his objective: to get rid of my strong centre pawns - again, that's why you shouldn't play Scandinavia. But in one look, why not 6. d6.} 6. d6 {And the mighty pawn advances! Nothing, not a pawn, can take it.} g6 {My opponent wants to develop his DSB through fianchetto.} 7. Bg5 {And I pin his knight. Too, frightfully, common.} Bg7 {He develops.} 8. Qd2 {Qd2. Again, quite common. If 8. ... O-O 9. Bh6, making a hole on the dark squares in Black's home. Sincerely, it's not that bad, but it's not that good either.} Nc6 {He develops his queen's knight, at last.} 9. Bb5 {And I pin his knight, again! Yet again, too common.} Rc8 {He defends his knight, and preparing for an attack down the queenside.} 10. O-O-O {And I castle queenside. A bit risky, I admit, but the c-file's not actually 'open'.} a6 {He wants to chase away my bishop.} 11. Bc4 {Bc4, relieving the pin, but its better than Ba4 and then b5.} b6 {Ooh - another gambit - he wants to rid out the root to my strong d- pawn.} 12. cxb6 {So I accept - note that if 12 ... Qxb6 13. d7+ Nxd7 14. Qxd7+ is not looking spectacular for black.} Rb8 {This attacks the b-pawn and takes away the threat of d7+ forking the pieces.} 13. Re1 {Pinning the king in the centre. I would castle if I were black, ignoring Bh6.} Rxb6 {He accepts the offer.} 14. Nd5 {And Nd5!!! Stunning move which exploits the pin on the g5-d8 diagonal, and the pin on the e-file. Stunning!} Rb7 {The rook retreats, but to an odd square, leaving the a6 pawn undefended.} 15. Nc7+ {But Nc7+ first displaces the king.} Kd7 {I prefer f8, don't you? A skewer on the d-file?} 16. Bxa6 {Threatening the rook.} Ra7 {Again, why not to b8? This is a rather odd rook?} 17. Nf3 {I develop my last piece.} Rf8 {He develops his rook, but it isn't doing much on c8.} 18. Bb5 {Yep. I'm threatening 19. Ne5+ Kc8 (19... Ke8 20. Bxc6+) 20. Nxc6 forking queen and rook.} Rxa2 {And he ignores it, playing a threat of his own! 19 ... Ra1# is mate. } 19. Ne5+ {I check first, however ...} Kc8 20. Ba6+ {20. Ba6!!! wins the exchange. If Kb8 then Nxc6# is a rather spectacular looking mate and queen fork. How lovely! Unfortunately, black sees this ...} Rxa6 {And takes with the rook.} 21. Nxa6 {I take.} Qa5 {And the threat of 22. Qa1# is renewed, forcing the exchange.} 22. d7+ {But why not check first?} Kb7 {The pawn is on the verge of promotion ...} 23. Qxa5 {... but the queens are swapped first.} Nxa5 24. Nc5+ {And the knight swoops in for a check.} Kc7 25. Bf4 {Planning a discovered check, winning the rook with 26. Nxg6+} Kd8 {My opponent is scared and hides.} 26. Red1 {Strengthening the d-pawn ...} h6 {h6??? Worst move ever. Probably threatening g5 but ...} 27. Nb7+ {Nb7!!! If Kc7, then Nxg6+ wins the rook and promotes, if Ke7 then Nxa5 threatening Nc6# and after that promoting, and if ...} Nxb7 {Nxb7 then ...} 28. Nc6# {Nc6 is a wonderful, most spectacular mate ever! And I'm only a point ahead! The pawn covers c8 and e8, the knight covers d8 and e7, the bishop covers c7 and most importantly, the rook covers the d7 pawn. Thank you for reading!
