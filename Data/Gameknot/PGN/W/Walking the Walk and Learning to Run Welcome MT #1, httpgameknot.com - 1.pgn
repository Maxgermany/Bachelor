[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70), Cozio defence deferred"]

1. e4 {This game can be boiled down to central themes. #1 pawn breaks which means pawns attack to create a weakness and #2. Central dominance. } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nge7 {Not normal, but still well within establish theory. The major draw back is that black's most important device for countering white is attacking e4 but now that is all but impossible. } 5. c3 {!? Play consistently until your aggressive opponent makes a mistake. This is the bedrock from which this opening system of white is built upon. I can not tell you how many times I have won tournaments by just playing safely and not going out of my way to create an attack. } g6 {Black aims for indirect control of the center while White is aiming for direct control. The lines in the sand could not drawn any clearer. } 6. O-O Bg7 {Black chooses the Cozio system in response to white's 5. c3. A good defensive position but not very strong against the deferred center system } 7. d4 {This pawn thrust can be played now or at anytime in the future. I played this because I knew that Jstevens is a spirited fighter and would not resist playing 7. ...exd4 giving me the majority of the center. FYI white's move order with c3 followed by d4 is known as the unassailable center because no matter what black does white will always maintain the edge in the center. } exd4 8. cxd4 {'centre' } b5 {!? this is fine but one of the defining features of the cozio system is to avoid harassing this bishop. It is base on the strategic idea that on a4 white's LSB is somewhat of play. Here instead black can most likely improve her position with 8. ...d5!? challenging the centre before white can consolidate it with Be3 and Bc2. Even more important is forcing white into playing an isolated pawn position.  Alternative variation: 8... d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Bg5 Qd6 11. Nbd2+/=  } 9. Bc2 {9. Bb3? is not good because it gives black time to get in ...c5 with tempo. 9...Na5 10. bc2 d6 is fine for black. Alternative variation: 9. Bb3 Na5 10. Bc2 d5  } O-O {Black's lack of direct attention in the center is actually disturbing Alternative variation: ['better is' ]  9... d5 10. exd5 Qxd5  ([or ]  10... Nb4 11. Nc3 O-O 12. Bg5 [ with very sharp pay] ) } 10. a4 {Novelty This is a thematic move which is played to provoke a weakness in black's queen side pawns. } Bb7 {?! more than likely this is not the best move since it allows white to make a favorable exchange on b5. Most of the time black is reluctantly forced to play 10. ...b4 followed by either ...a5 or ...Rb8 in order to keep the lanes closed. If you do not think black is forced to push the pawn forward then read on dear reader. Because this is where the game is won and lost. } 11. Nc3 {Attacking b5 twice and expecting ...b4 to be played. } d6 {If ...b4 then 13. Ne2 with an excellent game for white Alternative variation: 11... b4 12. Ne2 d5  } 12. axb5 {opening the dangerous a-file for attacking lanes. } axb5 13. Rxa8 {exchanging heavy artillery and expecting either ...Bxa8 or ...Qxa8 } Qxa8 {Alternative variation: [worse is ]  13... Bxa8 14. Nxb5  } 14. d5 {'greater board room' } Nb4 15. Bb3 Ba6 {?? The bishop while on b7 was the only thing from holding back white from steam rolling in the center. Alternative variation: ['better is' ]  15... Qe8 16. Re1 Na6 17. e5  } 16. Bf4 {'centre' now black can not stop e4-e5 } Rb8 {?? When you ignore what your opponent is doing in the center you will lose Alternative variation: ['better is' ]  16... Qb8 17. Re1 Re8 18. e5  } 17. Re1 Bc8 {Alternative variation: ['better is' ]  17... Nd3 18. Qxd3 b4 19. Qc2 bxc3 20. bxc3 Bd3 21. Qxd3 Rxb3  } 18. e5 {! crushing } Nf5 19. exd6 {Alternative variation: 19. g4  19... dxe5 20. Bxe5 Nd6 21. Bxg7 Bxg4 22. Ne4 $18  } Nxd6 {Alternative variation: 19... cxd6 20. Re8+ Bf8 21. g4 Bd7 22. Rxf8+ Rxf8 23. gxf5 Bxf5 24. Bxd6 Nd3 25. Bxf8 Qxf8 26. Nd4  } 20. Bxd6 cxd6 21. Re8+ Bf8 22. Qd4 Na6 {Alternative variation: $7  22... Nd3 23. Qxd3 Bd7 24. Rxb8 Qxb8 25. Nd4  } 23. Ne4 f5 24. Nf6+ Kf7 25. Ng5+ {mate in 2 }
