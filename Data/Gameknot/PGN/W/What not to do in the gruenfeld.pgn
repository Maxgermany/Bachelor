1. d4 {I open with the solid queen's pawn opening.} Nf6 2. c4 {Surprise!I usually play 2.Nf3 or 2.e3 for a stonewall.I said no more sidelines!I will ride the tiger...} g6 {King's Indian} 3. Nc3 d5 {The move that distinguishes the Gruenfeld.} 4. Bf4 {4.cxd5 and 4.Nf3 are also good,but this move suits my style.} Bg7 5. e3 {Developing natuarally.} dxc4 {?! from a psychological standpoint this move is bad.Black plays the Gruenfeld just to play like a QGA.} 6. Bxc4 O-O {? A bad mistake! 6...c5 is better.7.dxc5 Qa5 with Nf6-e4 threatened,but White would still have a slight advantage} 7. Nf3 Bg4 {too late is 7...c5 since 8.dxc5 Qa5 9.O-O Black has lost the sting of ...Ne4} 8. Qb3 {!? White takes advantage of the LSB departure.} Bxf3 9. gxf3 b6 {Now White has created a weakness in Black's queenside} 10. Nb5 Ne8 {Black's position is pathetic.} 11. O-O {A nuance would be exposed after 11.Bd5? c6 12.Bxb8 cxd5 13.Bxa7?? because of 13...Nd6! with a material advantage} Nc6 12. Rac1 {12.Bd5? Na5! looks pretty nasty.This preps for a combination...} Qd7 {?? the decisive mistake.Itis hard to suggest any productive moves in Black's position though.Maybe best is 12...Rc8 but after 13.Na3 White still looks better.} 13. Nxc7 {!} Nxc7 14. Bxc7 Rac8 {14...Qxc7 15.Bb5} 15. Bg3 Qf5 16. Ba6 {Black resigns.A sheer blowout!}
