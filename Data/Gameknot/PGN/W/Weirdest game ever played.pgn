[Opening "Vienna game (C26)"]

1. e4 {A normal, somewhat aggressive first move.} e5 {I generally have bad luck with the Sicilian so I like Open Game.} 2. Nc3 {An interestingly defensive choice of knight movement.  This is more of a waiting move than anything, leading to the dangerous Vienna Game.} Nf6 {Black decides to take the Falkbeer Defense, challenging the d5 square.} 3. Bc4 {White has nailed down the d-pawn by absolutely controlling the d5 square.} c6 {Alekhine recommends Nxe4 here - this move is rather timid and not terribly good.} 4. b4 {More aggression, White is trying to assert control over the fifth rank.} Bxb4 {But White makes a bad blunder there and gets Black's bishop out of the back rank, in a strong and annoying position to boot.} 5. d4 {Another, even worse move.  White is apparently trying to attack Black's center.} Bxc3+ {Black sees the undefended knight and the opportunity to check the king and fork the rook as well.} 6. Bd2 {The most sensible move, White wants that bishop off the board.} Bxa1 {Bxd2 or Bxd4 might be good here, but getting a rook off the board on the sixth move is always nice.} 7. c3 {White moves to trap the bishop in his corner; not the best move in the world since Qxa1 is available, though it does defend the d-pawn.} Nxe4 {More and more captures, leading to a weak White formation.} 8. Qb3 {Prepping for a Bxf7, a really bad move as White should have other priorities.} exd4 {Castling might work here but Black has nothing to fear from the weak check and will keep harassing White.} 9. Bxf7+ {White follows through. An attack, finally, although a weak one.} Kf8 {Forced, basically, as Ke7 pins in the queen and is asking for something bad to happen.} 10. Nf3 {An attack on the center, White wants to bolster up his burgeoning attack.} dxc3 {There is more havoc to be wreaked; White's attack is still pretty toothless and Black is having fun here.} 11. Bg5 {Now White has something going.} Qe8 {Rather a mistake, as Nxg5 was available, but it sets up a discovered check.} 12. Qb4+ {An obvious move, Black thinks he can exploit the Black dark-squared bishop being involved.} Kxf7 {Clearly he forgot that the queen was the only defender of the light-squared bishop.} 13. O-O {Eliminates the discovered check and gets the rook into playing position; Black will take anything it can get.} d5 {Black sees his neglected queenside and angles to get some of those pieces going.} 14. Re1 {Pinning the knight.} h6 {White does not have terribly many good moves here and attacks the bishop, which is a bit close for comfort.} 15. Be7 {White appears to be evident on trading queens, though doing so at the cost of a bishop is high stupidity.} Qxe7 {Black will take it.} 16. Ne5+ {A weak check.  Awful.} Qxe5 {Why not do it?} 17. Kf1 {White has no idea what to do.} Bb2 {Black wants to promote his long-neglected pawn and is trying to protect the promotion square.} 18. g3 {Building for a 19. f3.} c2 {Black wants to promote.} 19. f4 {White did it, and Black can't promote.} Nd2+ {Rather the worse intermezzo.  Bh3+ would have been better.} 20. Qxd2 {White will take the knight.} Bh3+ {Black's caught on and will do it here.} 21. Kf2 {Black either pins himself in the corner, loses his queen, or does this.} Qd4+ {Keeping the king moving.} 22. Qe3 {White finally wants to trade queens.} Qxe3+ {And Black will do so.} 23. Kxe3 {Capturing with the rook would give direct promotion.} Re8+ {Oh well, the rook will go anyway with this skewer.} 24. Kf2 {White will protect the rook.} Rxe1 {Wins promotion.} 25. Kxe1 {The only decent move.} c1=Q+ {And White resigned, utterly lost.  I'm sure I made mistakes.  Have fun with this anyway.}
