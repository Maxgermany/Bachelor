[Opening "Sicilian (B20), wing gambit, Marshall variation"]

1. e4 {This is probably one of my better wins though White did throw it away at the end.  I had some fairly interesting plays this game.  Lets start with the typical opening.  e4} c5 {My typical response to e4 after I learned to play the Sicilian back 4 years ago.} 2. b4 {The wing gambit the only gambit that I can recall of the top of my head for the Sicilian defense.  I believe the idea is for white to try to keep his d-pawn.  White should be able to almost always form the ideal pawn center with this opening.  I see no reason to not accept this sacrifice.} cxb4 3. a3 {white plans on opening the file for his rook and allowing the development of the dsb to the a3-f8 diagonal where it plays influence on the development of the e pawn due to the somewhat undermining Bxf8 Kxf8.  I decided that I don't like that plan so instead I decide to start my move on the center and develop if axb4 with the move e6.} e6 4. axb4 Bxb4 5. c3 {A decent reply white gains the center for now with d4 next move and forces me to expend the tempo I gained from whites axb4.} Be7 {I decided on this move because I wanted to set a solid defense with a Scheveningen style structure for black.  Whites central pawns will end up marching at some point via e5 or d5.  So I plan on having my bishops in a defensive style for the moment and what for my chance to counter attack.} 6. d4 Nf6 {Attempting to get white to play e5 so d6 can come with a possible pawn exchange not to mention if I can get my knight set up on d5 could be good for me.  The downside to this move order is white has the potential to increase the squeeze on black.  Example being e5 Nd5 c4 Nc7 where black plans d6 or d5 in order to break things open.} 7. Bd3 d6 {Adopting my counterattacking structure. I feel fairly flexible with this set up.} 8. Nf3 O-O {I want to get my king away from potential checks along the e8-a4 diagonal though Bd7 was also possible I have the idea of possibly moving my bishop to b7 instead to attack d5, and put pressure on e4.  Keeping the flexibility alive.} 9. O-O Nbd7 10. Na3 a6 {Taking back control of the b5 square though I feel that my pawns will be weak after my eventual b5.} 11. Re1 b5 {? in hindsight I forgot about the pin on the a8 rook though I didn't have a whole lot of choice I could have played b6 first maybe.  The point being I want to get my bishop into the action and fast.} 12. Nxb5 Bb7 {Now white must expend a tempo to keep the knight.  I haven't lost my passed pawn as of yet. which I would believe blacks advantage at the moment.} 13. Na3 Qc7 {Development and attack of the c3 pawn.  Black is now ready to begin the attack on the center that I have been preparing for.} 14. c4 e5 {My idea was to exchange on d4 or have the possibility of playing Nc5 to attack whites bishop on c3 and possible win the e4 pawn.  If white decides to close down the center with d5 I can play Nc5 and eventually have the plan of f5 to bust open the center.} 15. Bb2 Rab8 {I feel that having the potential to attack the bishop on b2 could be good for me. I also have the possible plan of unbalancing the position which you will see in a few more moves.} 16. Qd2 {Protecting the b2 bishop.} exd4 {I want to get my d7 knight out.} 17. Nxd4 {I believe this is the better of the take backs the knight does well on d4 but this is what I wanted from white.} Nc5 {My knight finally comes to the c5 square where it has a threat on the d3 bishop and the possible plan of Nxd3 Bxe4 or Nxe4.} 18. f3 {White defends from this threat but now my plan I mentioned a few minutes ago comes into play.  First thing is to remove the defender of the b2 bishop.} Nxd3 19. Qxd3 {Now that the b2 bishop is undefended I can attack the b2 bishop.} Bxe4 {!? here is the plan i mention a few minutes ago.  White won't take back with the rook or queen because I can just play Nxe4.  White now must deal with the reality of the lsb's attack on his/her queen.} 20. Qe2 {I think this is the best of what white can play.  But how does black continue now?  } Bd3 {Walking more into the fire white must again deal with bishops attack on the queen he can try Qxe7 Qxe7 Rxe7 Rxb2 and both sides have fairly dynamic position.  I think I may slightly favor white in that position.  But I thought that white may have the better of it when I played Bxe4, but I couldn't resist. } 21. Qd2 {White's decision attempts to make everything work out well for him.  If Bxc4 Nxc4 and I'm in big trouble.  It keeps the defense of the dsb and if white gets to many move he may find a way to defend everything.} d5 {I plan on however supporting my bishop  with dxc4 or Nxd5 after cxd5 in order to add protection to my e7 bishop.} 22. Qxd3 {White finally decides to exchange.} Rxb2 23. Rab1 {Continues the exchange white is probably hoping for Rxb1 Rxb1 dxc4 Nxc4.} Bxa3 {The in between move.} 24. Qxa3 Rxb1 25. Rxb1 Qxc4 {and now for the moment black is up two pawns and everything is defended.  Whites counter play is his activity.} 26. Nf5 {I was seeing sparks from white here with the interesting combination attempt Ne7+ Kh8 Ng6+ winning the rook on f8. I can't move my rook via e8 or c8 due to the nasty fork Nd6. } g6 {?! I don't like this move now my idea was that once white plays Ne7 I could defend with Kg7.} 27. Qb2 {now things are starting to feel very uneasy.  White seems to have formed an attack out of my passive position for the moment.} d4 {I sac a pawn in the hopes of trading off queens here.  Thought there is another reason for this sacrifice.} 28. Nxd4 Qc5 {and here it is now white is at least pinned down for the moment and it gives me a few moves to try to come out of my passivity.} 29. Rc1 {Attempting to free himself.} Qe5 {another pin.  trying to give myself some time or hopefully some breathing room from a move from white.} 30. Qf2 {And here it is the pins are done but whites attack has been slightly weakened black now has the opportunity to come out of the shell a little.} Ra8 {I deiced on getting my rook where it belongs with the idea of pushing my passed pawn and gain the initiative.} 31. Nc6 {White response by slowing down my pawns advances.} Qb5 {adding protection to my pawn.} 32. Qd4 Kg7 {yes my knight is now pinned but I couldn't come up with any other way to deal with the problems I plan on trying to trade queens in order to release the tension on my position.} 33. Ne7 {Stopping my plan of Qd5.} Qd7 {now I believe I forced my trade of queens due to Qe5 Qe6 and I think I get my queen trade, or release of my knight from the pin.} 34. Qc3 {?? white blunders } Qxe7 {White resigns.  Would have been interesting to see the rest of the game played out.  If white hadn't blundered away the knight.}
