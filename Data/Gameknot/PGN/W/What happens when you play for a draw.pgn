1. c4 Nf6 {The English opening, Anglo-Indian Defense.} 2. Nf3 g6 {Black goes for a kingside fianchetto.} 3. Ng1 {?! White undevelops his knight.} Bg7 4. Qa4 {!? More natural moves include 4. d4, 4. Nf3, and 4. g3.} O-O 5. Qxd7 {?? GM Huebner blunders his queen, perhaps he thought he was playing black.} Qxd7 {5...Nbxd7 seems more accurate.} 6. g4 {? White weakens his kingside and gives up a pawn without compensation. This is unsound.} Qxd2+ {?? Unfortunately Black misses the free pawn and blunders.} 7. Kxd2 Nxg4 {This is the right move, but it was played one move too late.} 8. b4 {?? White leaves his rook en prise.} a5 {?? black is playing too fast.} 9. a4 {?? White does not see the attack...} Bxa1 10. Bb2 {?? Better is 10. b5.} Nc6 {??} 11. Bh8 {??} Bg7 {??} 12. h4 {??} axb4 {?? draw agreed. "This incident was in the nature of a protest because Huebner had many adjournments pending and he wanted to rest. But his captain assigned him to play against the Americans, telling him that a quick draw would be acceptable." -- Pal Benko}
