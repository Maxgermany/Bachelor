[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 {The King's Pawn Game.} e5 {He chose the double kings pawn opening instead of the Sicilian Defense, but I am also used to this defense.} 2. Nf3 {I respond and start to develop my minor pieces by bringing out my knight.  This also threatens him with Nxe5.} Nc6 {He protects his pawn on e5 by bringing out his knight.} 3. Bc4 {Now, I finish developing the minor pieces on my king's side by bringing out my bishop.} d6 {I do not know why he picked that candidate.} 4. Bd5 {If I played Bb5, he would have been able to get rid of the pin with a6 because I would not have been able to capture his knight Bxc6, or he would get a pass pawn on the a square.  Therefore, I play Bd5 in my attempt to capture the knight and give him two weak pawns because two of his pawns would be on the c square. } Nb4 {He responds with Nb4 and threatens to capture my bishop with Nxd5 to protect his knight.} 5. Bc4 {I protect my bishop by playing Bc4.} Nf6 {Now he decides to bring out his other knight.} 6. O-O {At this point, I decide to castle, but it is not a great move.  Instead, I should have played d3.} Bg4 {That is because he could have captured a free pawn with Nxe4, but I am lucky because he play Bg4, instead.  That is worse for me because my knight is now pinned on f3.} 7. c3 {Now, I threaten to capture his knight with cxb4 by playing c3.} Nc6 {He responds by pulling his knight back with Nc6.} 8. h3 {I decide to break his pin with h3.} Bh5 {Because my pawn is now on h3, he can no longer exchange my knight with Bxf3.} 9. Bd5 {At this point, I play Bd5 in order to force an exchange with Nxd5 and exd5.} Nxd5 10. exd5 {This way, I also threaten to capture his knight with dxc6.} Ne7 {He responds to the threat by pulling his knight back with Ne7.} 11. Qb3 {At this point, I loose control of my temper because I missed an immediate mating pattern in a different game, and that infuriates and distracts me in this game.  Therefore, I begin to make to fast, abrupt, careless, and reckless mistakes.  For example, I decide to play Qb3 so that I could threaten him with Qxb7 and capture his pawn, but this is a bad move and a serious mistake because I was pinned.  Therefore, I will have two bad pawns on the f square, and my king will be exposed when there is an exchange with Bxf3 and gxf3.  In fact, Jack Stockel would say, "that looses immediately". } Bxf3 12. gxf3 Rb8 {Now, he protects his pawn on b7 with Rb8.} 13. Qa3 {At this point, I threaten to capture his pawn with Qxa7 by playing Qa3.} Nxd5 {He responds and captures my pawn with Nxd5.} 14. Re1 {Because I am enraged and explode, I was oblivious to any major threat and play Re1 instead of d4 which would have forced an exchange with exd4 and cxd4 and prevented him from playing Nf4 because of my bishop on c1.  I also could have played d3, and that also would have prevented him from playing Nf4 for the same reason.  As a result, I am now in big trouble, and the game is lost. } Nf4 {Because he played Nf4, I thought that he would capture a free pawn and check me with Nh3+, but he does not do this.  In fact, it is much more serious then what I thought.} 15. Re3 {Now, I am really infuriated, so I play Re3 to put pressure on his knight.  I do not play Re4 and threaten to capture his knight with Rxf4 because of his pawns on e5 and d6, but it does not matter because it is too late since he just found a mating pattern against me.} Qg5+ 16. Kf1 {Because he checked me with Qg5+ I am forced to play Kf1 because he will checkmate me immediately with Qg2# if I play Kh1 or Kh2, but I am now in trouble and cannot get out of it.  That is because I am going to loose the game no matter what since it is inevitable.  I was hoping that he would not play Kf1 so that I could get out of danger, but I knew that it was not going to happen because it would be too easy, otherwise.   } Qg2+ {At this point, I resign because he has an inevitable mating pattern against me and will mate me in one move with Qg1#.  I remembered from this game that people make mistakes, even masters and grandmasters at chess, because it is, "human nature", and one is, ..."only human, not a machine".  I did, however, learn an important lesson from this game.  In fact, I recently learned from Jack Stockel that even the best players make mistakes.  There was an OTB tournament between the second and forth best players in the world with ratings over 1800.  The second best player made an extremely serious and shocking blunder because he inadvertently sacked his queen by not being careful.  Therefore, he lost and became the 4th best player, and his rating was 2815.   I also learned that when a person is mad, he or she should take a break from and not play chess until the player has recovered from anger, and it could take hours to fully recover.  However, one can't play chess well when he or she is angry.   }
