1. e4 {This is a WtW mini tournament game against a player quite a bit stronger than me. A dubious choice in the opening left him behind material, and he never managed to get it back. Anyway, this is my highest non-blitz victory. The forced moves end on move six for black.} e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ng5 h6 6. Nxf7 Qf6 {This is the choice I marked as maybe not great, as it allows my to take his rook for my knight. The only advantage is that it doesn't get his king out in the opening. But then again, easy19 played this move and beat my in seventeen.} 7. Nxh8 d6 {I guess there was no rush to take the knight because it couldn't go anywhere without being taken.} 8. Nc3 f3 9. gxf3 gxf3 10. Bc4 {And now if he doesn't take my knight, then I win his knight.} Bg4 {! If I take his knight, then a discovered attack wins my queen.} 11. O-O {But I spot it. He can still win my queen, but I can take his back.} f2+ 12. Rxf2 Qxf2+ 13. Kxf2 Bxd1 {I lose some material there, but I didn't see anything else I could have done. If someone sees something, then please comment. At lease I can get his knight.} 14. Bxg8 Bxc2 {He takes the time to pick off a pawn.} 15. Ng6 {I start to try to extricate my pieces from the upper right corner.} Nd7 16. Be6 O-O-O {This close to the endgame I might have stayed in the middle.} 17. d4 {Preparing to develop my last minor piece} c6 18. Bxd7+ Kxd7 {It's usually good to trade when you're ahead.} 19. Nxf8+ {I know, I know, my knight was more active than the bishop, but I didn't see anything else to do with the knight, and this close to the endgame a bishop is pretty strong, especially once it gets out of the pawn wall.} Rxf8+ 20. Ke2 d5 {Here I start trying to trap the bishop while he tries to get it out.} 21. Bxh6 {But first I snag a pawn and attack the rook.} Rh8 22. Bg7 {? I should have played Bg5 to keep the pawn.} Rxh4 23. b3 {The bishop is immobilized. Unfortunately, there are a lot of pieces attacked e4.} Rh2+ {Hmm, I would probably have played Bxe4.} 24. Ke3 {Here I offered a draw because while I was ahead, his bishop was no longer in danger and a draw was pretty good for me against someone this strong. I wouldn't have done it against someone weaker though.} Rh3+ {He declined it.} 25. Kd2 Rh2+ 26. Ke3 b6 27. exd5 cxd5 28. Nxd5 {And after the little pawn flurry I end up one ahead, but his bishop is no longer blocked in.} Kd6 {?? This allows a fork} 29. Be5+ {Winning a rook for a knight} Kxd5 30. Bxh2 Be4 31. Rf1 a6 32. Rf4 Bb1 {Saving his bishop and going for my pawns} 33. Rf6 {Now if he captures my pawn I can recapture a different one.} Bxa2 34. Rxb6 {Here he resigned. It was only a matter of time before I promoted and checkmated. Please comment and rate.}
