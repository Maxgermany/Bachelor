1. Nf3 {Having begun other games with e4, b4 and d4, I thought I'd try this one.  It can lead to a King's Indian Attack, or a Reti, or transpose into something else altogether.} d5 2. d4 {...such as a Queen's Pawn opening...} Nc6 {Tchigorin defence.  The placement of the Knight in front of the c-pawn strikes me as counter-intuitive, but if one of the world's earliest experimenters of openings thought this viable, I'm not going to argue.  I don't reckon it is an easy line, but several master games even up to the present day have gone this route.} 3. g3 {I could have mede it a line of Queen's Gambit by 3.c4, or played for a Colle System by 3.e3 or 3.c3 - any number of possibilities.  This looked as though it might be interesting.} Nf6 4. Bg2 Bf5 {Sooner or later Black will want to play ...e6.  He wants his bishop outside the pawn chain, where it would be more immediately active.} 5. O-O e6 6. c4 {Transforming the game into a type of hybrid Queen's Gambit - Catalan System.  This doesn't necessarily gambit a pawn ...} b6 {(?!) The first indication that Black is unsure how to proceed.  To be honest, I don't know much about this sort of position either, but could see that this loosening of Black's position did not augur well for his future.    Instead of the text, 6...dxc4 would have been fine.  If White wanted he could have got the pawn back at once by 7.Qa4.  Also good for Black would have been 6...Be7.  My immediate thought was how to 'get in' Qa4 and Ne5 to win the Knight.  As it doesn't work, I carried on more 'normally'.} 7. Nc3 {Straightforward development, inviting Black again to take the c-pawn.} Bd6 {(?)  Now, you might ask yourself, what on earth could be wrong with this move?  It develops a piece - on an active square, too.  It does explain, also, the purpose behind Black's previous move: to inhibit c4-c5, which would dislodge the bishop from this posting.  The beginnings of the answer lie in White's reply, played without the slightest hesitation.} 8. Bg5 {(!) Now that is a very annoying pin, though Black probably didn't think so.  But White is already threatening 9.cxd5! (exd5 10.Nxd5).  Probably Black's best option is to drop the bishop back to e7, accepting the loss of a tempo.  Understandably he didn't want to do this.  But I was surprised by his next move.} Ne7 {(?!) Was this to break the pin at f6 or free the c-pawn?  White could have taken the knight at once, but a sudden evil thought crossed my mind...} 9. Nh4 {(!) 'Knights on the rim are dim.'  Not this spectre grim: just look at him advancing with vim!} Qd7 {Clearing the back rank for castling long, and also breaking the pin outright.  But now comes the series of exchanges that leaves Black's pawn structure shattered.} 10. Nxf5 {(!) How should Black retake?} exf5 {The alternative was 10...Nxf5 11.Bxf6 gxf6  12.cxd5 and if 12...exd5 13.Nxd5, threatening to pick up the f-pawn, or unmask a battery along the long light diagonal.  Even without 12...exd5, Black's centre would have come under enormous pressure.} 11. Bxf6 {Who can resist saddling his opponent with tripled pawns?} gxf6 {Apart from this being a fairly rare sight, tripled pawns usually are as dire as they sound.  When they do occur they will very likely be isolated and therefore vulnerable and hard to defend.  But it is not all down side.  For a start, Black has two open files to play with, which is two more than White has right now.  The other is that those pawns control a heck of a lot of squares upon those adjacent files.  Far more significant is the fact that Black loses his d-pawn and remains a pawn behind.} 12. cxd5 {Also possible was 12.Nxd5 Nxd5  13.cxd5.  But I wanted to keep the Knights on.} h5 {(!) Very good move!  Black seeks salvation in the more immediately available g-file and an attack upon White's castled position.  No other plan really suggests itself here.} 13. Qd3 {13.e3 was an alternative, but I had it in mind to push the pawn 2 squares when I pushed it at all.  I also had some vague ideas concerning the b5 and a6-squares.} f4 {(!?) A spirited try that I didn't quite expect, though I saw it as a possibility.   Black has no plan to exchange pawns (14.gxf4 Bxf4) on account of 15.d6!  His idea is to prize open the g-file for his rooks, and, you never know, the Queen's over-watch upon the h3-square might come in useful as well.  But maybe the continued advance of the h-pawn would have had better results.} 14. Ne4 {Threatening a fork by Nxf6ch.} Rh6 {(!) The only good defence.  If 14...Nxd5?? 15.Nxf6ch Nxf6 16.Bxa8 would have won the exchange.} 15. Nxd6+ {Yep:  White is after the leading f-pawn...} cxd6 {(?) Understandably, Black didn't want to subject her Queen to carrying out blockading duties.  But 15...Qxd6 was the right move, even though White could still play 16.gxf4 and win the second pawn: 15...Qxd6  16.fxg4 Qxf4?? 17.d6.} 16. gxf4 O-O-O {Another reason for White's earlier Q-move to d3: a6 beckons...} 17. e4 {Building up the central phalanx.  This will be the game winner.  Speaking of pawns, J.R. Capablanca used to speak of pawn groupings, especially in the endgame, as islands.  The fewer the 'islands' the more secure the structure.  Here Black has the maximum - 4 pawn islands; White one fewer with 3.  Dominating them all is the central White mass thrown forward, both White's flanks refused and hard for Black to come at.  But we haven't reached the endgame quite yet...} f5 {Wow!  Does this mean that White will also get 4 pawn islands?  And tripled pawns as well??} 18. f3 {Not in this life!  In the sequel, White takes as his first priority to preserve the integrity of his central pawn mass.  That the flanks of the mass comprise doubled pawns is all to the good: the whole exerts a powerful control of the immediate surroundings.    It is reminiscent of the tactical attacking formation of Napoleonic French Brigade columns: Ordre Mixte.} Rg8 {Just about his best chance: operate directly against the White King.  But the invasion route is very narrow and localised.  } 19. Kh1 {At once breaking the pin.  It is clear that Black will want to advance his h-pawn, the only lever he has since the f-pawns are held up. White wants his bishop to be free to move, so he plans to blockade with it at h3.} Kb7 {(!?) Crossing any idea White might have had in bringing the Queen to a6, and also taking the King off the h3-c8 diagonal and the c-file as well.  Insofar as Black saw Bh3 coming, good thinking, but better might have been ...Kb8.  A White Queen at a6 would not have been able to achieve much, and until it could, the Queen wasn't going there.} 20. Rac1 {Black committed to the K-side, White has in mind the c-file as the invasion route, and already has the c6-square earmarked for the bridgehead.} h4 {Yes, well, that has to be stopped, right now.} 21. Bh3 {Halting the pawn's progress.  That the file is left open is of little help to Black as he has nowhere he can establish a foothold in White's position.  Having said that, though, White has to keep an eye on the possibility of the enemy knight coming in via g6 to f4 and forking Q and B.  Speaking of Bishops and Knights, the canny reader will have noted that this is a Bishop vs Knight game.  In close games such as this, the Knight is usually a match and even more for the Bishop.  Here I regard the pieces as more or less a balance for each other, and both are about the handiest pieces available to either side.  Maybe the Knight is slightly the superior minor piece at that.  White's advantages lie altogether elsewhere, in particular the stranglehold he has on the centre, but also the quicker access he has to the Q-side.  } Rh5 {(!) For the moment, ...Ng6 was not playable, so Black prepares the way.  } 22. Rf2 {(!?) I could I suppose have challenged Black on the g-file by Rg1.  But the plan here was to vacate the f1-square for the Bishop whilst preparing to double rooks on the c-file.  Whilst combining defence and attack, attack was the foremost consideration.} Ng6 {Per spec:  Black threatens to bust the game open with 23...Nxf4.} 23. Qe3 {(!)  Played after a long, long think.  All sorts of attacking moves crossed my mind here (Bf1, Qa3, Qc4, Rc6, Rfc2), but none of them seemed to lead anywhere decisive - and even suggested White might end up forgoing some of his edge.  This defensive move stopped Black's counter-attack in its tracks - where to from here? - and maintained White's pressure down the c-file, with the possibility of Q and B reinforcements being thrown in in due time.} Re8 {(?) Abandoning the g-file.  The move looks OK, as it rules 24.Bxf5?? out of court.  Possibly Black ought to have challenged White's tenure of the c-file, because that is about to become absolute.  The Gameknot engine suggests 23...Ne7, which would at least reopen the g-file, and thown some obstacles along the c-file.  But who could contemplate such an abject abandonment of his hopes?} 24. Rfc2 {Now Black has no way to drive White off the file.  The invasion can not be far off.} Ne7 {The Knight has to break off his journey after all.  But at least Black can make White fight to establish his foothold in Black's position!  The 'Battle of c6' begins.} 25. Qa3 {Eyeing a6 and d6.  The latent pin on the e-file is broken at the same time.} Rc8 {The battle for the c6-square escalates!  But White was threatening to come in a c6 anyway, as the Knight was unable to defend c6 even with royal assistance: 26.Rc6 Nxc6??  27.dxc6ch winning the Queen.} 26. Rc2xc8 Nxc8 27. Rc6 {The Battle of c6 ends in a victory for White.  Now that a bridgehead has been established, White will look for ways of extending it.  At the moment, d6 is under attack, as is f5.  The outnumbered Black pawns are too scattered to provide an effective defence.} Qd8 28. Bf1 {Probably 28.Bf5 was just as good, but I wasn't really prepared to offer any chances based upon ...Ne7(!).  Throughout this game, I had gone to considerable pains to deny Black counterplay.  He wasn't making that task easy!  The threat is, of course, 29.Ba6ch, winning the Knight.} Ne7 29. Ba6+ {A good alternative was 29.Rxd6 at once.  But I had made up my mind now to exchange down to a winning endgame.} Kb8 30. Qxd6+ Qxd6 31. Rxd6 fxe4 {Otherwise White would have played 32.e5, and closed the game out with his central pawn pair.} 32. fxe4 {Now there are just remnants of Black's army left to face this newly mobile pawn phalanx.} f5 {(?) A slip, but really, what else could Black sensibly do?  I considered 33.e5 here, but the win of the enemy knight was too much to pass up.} 33. Re6 {The knight is a goner, having no sensible moves available to itself (33...Nc8  34.Re8 or d6); and the only other move (33...Rh7) leads to 34.d6 whereat the knight is lost anyway.  So, after a valiant defence against long odds, Black at last waved the white flag.  1-0}
