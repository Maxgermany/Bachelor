[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 e6 {The French Defense: solid, if a little passive. } 2. d4 {Standard. } c5 {This is reminiscent of the Benoni. } 3. Nf3 {Now we've transposed to a standard open Sicilian. } cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {The Kan Variation (of the Sicilian). It's probably worth mentioning that my Sicilian play is really not very good ;-) } 5. Bd3 {White keeps his options open--he still may play c2-c4 and set up a Marcoczy Bind on d5, or else play f2-f4 with a big kingside assault. } Be7 {5...Bc5 is more common. } 6. Nc3 Nc6 {Both sides continue development. } 7. Nxc6 {Paving the way for a pawn wedge at e5. } dxc6 8. e5 {This pawn may prove troublesome for Black to remove now. } Bg5 9. f4 Bh6 {? The computer dislikes this and I'm inclined to agree. This Bishop no longer has any prospects from this side of the board--it ought to just retreat to e7. } 10. g4 {White steps on the gas. The GK computer came up with a better move here, taking advantage of Black's out-of-position Bishop: 10.Ne4! This threatens 11.Nd6+ and there's nothing at all that Black can do to stop it, or to drive White's Knight away anytime soon. } g6 {Creating a bolthole for the Bishop. I actually like the more aggressive 10...Qh4+! 11.Kf1 g6 here. } 11. g5 Bg7 12. Be3 {White continues development and prepares to castle queenside. } Ne7 {Making for one of Black strong points on d5 or f5. } 13. Qd2 Nd5 14. Bf2 {White's dark-square Bishop is 'bad', but not bad enough that he wants to trade it away. Especially in contrast to the Black Bishops, which are both miserable. } Nxc3 15. Qxc3 O-O {The computer dislikes this. Admittedly, it is castling into a bit of a firestorm, but White has a lot of work to do to prove that he has an attack. I think this is fine. } 16. O-O-O b5 {? This, on the other hand, is definitely a mistake. Because of the potential for discovered attacks against the BQ, White now has his choice of free pawns to grab--b5 or g6. Besides that, this pawn push creates even more weak dark squares that Black is powerless to defend. } 17. h4 {?! The computer prefers 17.Bxg6, with good reason. I considered it (and Bxb5), but ultimately decided to go with the text move because White's position is so superior--the extra pawn doesn't make much difference, but it's going to take several tempi to open the h file. Beginning the process now, while there's still a big threat on the table, seemed like a good way to get in a 'free' move. } Bd7 {Blocking the threat against the Queen and freeing the Ra8. 17...Qd5 (threatening a2) or 17...Qc7 were also definitely possible here.  } 18. h5 {Continuing to push on the Black kingside. } Re8 19. hxg6 fxg6 {One defender of g6 taken care of. Now things are really starting to get interesting. As White, I'm looking for an opportunity for a sacrifice on g6 to blast open the BK, but I also need to keep him from escaping to the queenside, since after a sacrifice like that I'd need real compensation. So... } 20. Bc5 {This blocks off the BK's most likely escape routes and traps the Rook at the same time. The computer suggests that Black's best option to ease the pressure here is 20...Rd7, sacrificing an exchange in order to assure his King's safety. } Bf8 {? This spells trouble, though. White doesn't need the Bishop to block in the King if he can get Black's own pieces to do it for him. } 21. Bxf8 Rxf8 {If 21...Kxf8 22.Rxh7 with a huge advantage for White. But now the BK can't escape through f8 at all. } 22. Bxg6 {! At the time, I really had no idea if this was truly sound, but as I told Dan at the time, 'it looks like too much fun to pass up.' The computer vindicates me here, giving this as the best move. The point is that if 22...hxg6, White will play 23.Qh3, and then his attack down the h-file is basically unstoppable. } Rxf4 {! Black also finds the correct move here. Taking the Bishop would be a deadly mistake. } 23. Bxh7+ Kg7 24. Qd3 {?? I was trying to lay a trap here: if 24...Qxg5, then 25.Rg1, winning the Queen--or so I thought. Far better was 24.Qe3, though many other options were available that were better than the text. Even 24.Kb1 was preferable (as you'll see...) } Qxg5 {! Black dares me to spring my 'trap'. White's correct move here is the simple 25.Qxd7+ Rf7 dis.ch. 26.Qd2. Note also that my original plan has already fallen through: I was seconds from playing 25.Rdg1??, but just in time I noticed that 25...Rf1! would be mate! That revelation unfortunately didn't convince me to rethink my plan... } 25. Rhg1 {?? Black's resources are more vast than I ever imagined at this point... } Rg4+ {! This is a great move. I had only really looked at what seemed like the obvious choices: 25...Rf3+ or (better) 25...Rd4+, where 26.Qd2 Rxd2 27.Rxg5+ Kxh7 28.Rxd2 leaves White with a Rook for a Bishop and a strong position. I overlooked the text move entirely, and it's much, much stronger than I initially realized. } 26. Qd2 {26.Kb1 is not significantly better (26...Rxg1 27.Qxd7+ Kh8 28.Be4 and White is down an exchange and can hope for a draw at best). } Qxd2+ 27. Kxd2 Rxg1 28. Rxg1+ Kxh7 {Black has reduced to a very favorable endgame with accurate play. His Bishop is still miserable but now he has all the time he needs to fix it. } 29. b4 {Preventing ...c5. } a5 30. a3 axb4 31. axb4 Be8 {The Bishop finally comes out. } 32. Rh1+ Kg7 33. Kc3 Rd8 34. Rg1+ Bg6 35. Kb3 Rd5 36. Re1 Rd4 {Intending ...Re4. There's little White can do at this point; Black's advantages steadily grow with accurate play. } 37. c3 Re4 38. Rd1 Rxe5 39. Rd6 Be8 40. Kc2 Kf6 41. Kd3 {? Probably 41.Rd4 was stiffer. } Rd5+ 42. Rxd5 cxd5 43. Kd4 Kf5 44. Kc5 {Likewise, 44.Ke3 was a better resistance, but White could easily resign any time. There's no way to stop Black from promoting. } Ke5 45. Kb6 Kd6 {The WK is trapped, far from the e-pawn. } 46. Kb7 e5 47. Kb6 e4 48. Kb7 e3 49. Kb6 e2 50. c4 {The last hurrah. } dxc4 51. Ka5 e1=Q {Mate in 3. } 52. Kb6 Bc6 {2 } 53. Ka7 Kc7 {1 } 54. Ka6 Qa1# {Very well played by pennsylvaniadan. He was consistently more accurate in his calculations during the critical point in the game, and definitely earned this victory. Many thanks for the game, and thank you all for reading! }
