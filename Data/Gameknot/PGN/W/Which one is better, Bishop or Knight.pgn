1. d4 {I think 1. d4 is very common. Usually I play 1 ... d5, but today I shall decide to do something different.} Nf6 {I'm not sure if this is the right knight, but I don't think I'll regret it too much.} 2. Nc3 {White develops a knight. This protects the e4 square.} d5 {But I won't let white take care of the centre that easily. } 3. Nf3 {White develops another knight. } Nc6 {I do the same. I am just trying to develop my pieces and take control of the centre, as everybody usually does. } 4. Bd2 {I think this is an intresting move. It will be hard to develop the queen and connect the rooks, though.} Bf5 {First, develop my LSB, so I am then ready to play e6} 5. e3 {This move lets white's LSB out but blocks the DSB. Anything better?} e6 6. Bb5 {Pinning my knight and getting ready to castle. } Bd6 {Attacking the defend h-pawn which might be a bit vulnerable after white castles.} 7. O-O {Gets the king into saftey, or does it?} O-O 8. Re1 {Nice move. But what's wrong with simply taking the c6 knight?} Qd7 {Develops my queen, protects the c6 knight and connects the rooks. 3 in 1!} 9. Qe2 {White now connects his rooks. But I think his position is a bit squashed. } Rfe8 {Developing my rooks.} 10. Rad1 {Good move. But the h2 pawn is left undefended.} a6 {Chasing away the bishop, } 11. Bxc6 {Which one is better, Bishop or Knight (in this position)?} Qxc6 12. b4 {White is trying to chase my Queen away.} b5 {Not so fast!} 13. Ne5 {A fine outpost for the knight, attacking my queen as well.} Qb6 14. a4 {Strange and intresting move. } bxa4 {What else can I do?}
