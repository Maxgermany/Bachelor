[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {So, he starts out with my favorite opening.} c5 {So, this is my standard defense.} 2. Qh5 {?! Now, this move is unprecedented.  I understand that this move is inaccurate and completely out of book.  Normally, I would refute this move with 2...g6 or 2...Nf6 to punish black for not developing properly.  However, I know what his intentions are, in this position.  And, I will allow it, in order to learn from what's about to come.} d6 {Therefore, I just respond with the normal continuation of my defense.  In other words, I decided to treat this as though it was a normal Sicilian.  But, in reality, I know that it is anything but that.} 3. Qxf7+ {So, this is where things get interesting.} Kxf7 {And, this is what he expects me to do.  That's because easy19 said, "yup you got the queen and are winning. Now show me"} 4. Nf3 {Well, he starts by developing.  On the one hand, I expected him to try and get something back, in this position.  But, on the other hand, I know that it is not feasible to do that, yet.} Nf6 {Meanwhile, I am also going to start developing.  The reason being is to avoid the same mistake that monkeykungphu made in his game against tactical-abyss.  In one of the comments to that annotations, schakertjie said, "Black hasn't moved any minor pieces at all. Black should try to look at those obvious threats after black sacs his queen."  So, I kept that in mind before making any other move.} 5. Nc3 {In the meantime, he decides to continue with development. } d5 {? Now, this is extremely interesting.  While one can argue that this move does not develop anything, it can be said that in this position, my goal is to control the center.  I start with this move because it advances a central pawn one step further.  According to different commentators, they have previously implied central pawns have to be advanced a little further to control center.  Because central pawns are the main aspects of central control, and I remembered that with this move.  In addition, my main goal is to exchange, but this is black's first mistake, according to my opponent. That's because he said, "well actually i wanted to tell you after your next move. that it took you about 5 moves to give away all the advantage i gave you. back to me."  The problem here is that I miscalculated.  I told my opponent that aside from analyze the board, I often get the facts wrong by miscalculating.  And, he said, ..."that is exactly where you are going wrong."   } 6. exd5 {So, he takes as I expected.   } Nxd5 {And, as I had implied on my last move, I decide to recapture.  However, according to Fred, "6...Nxd5 should have been Nbd7 just development. so you adapt it slightly because your king is out. ( first get in position before you press your advantage. )"} 7. Nxd5 {Now, as expected, he retakes.} Qxd5 {But, this was still part of my plan since move 5.  But, easy19 said that, "7...Qxd5 should have been e6 or Nc6 so actually you can say to take is a mistake."  And, his advice was, "Tip: try not to win in your upcoming new games, just try to last as long as possible. And ignore most of the moves from your opponents ( or in short play your own game )"  } 8. Bc4 {But, white has plans of his own.  In this position, he decides to attack my Q by pinning it to the K. } Qxc4 {?? At first, I seemed nervous and asked my self what could be done, in this position.  Then, I figured out the answer.  It is feasible take his LSB, since he left it vulnerable.  Before making this move, I asked myself if he had a good reason for doing this.  The reason is that sometimes, your opponent has a good reason for doing this.  I learned it the hard way in a couple of my past games.  After looking the position, however, I figured out that this is just a blunder.  He blundered it away, or so it seemed.  So I decided to take it immediately.  That's because it appears that there are no threats, in this position.  However, he has something to hide, so this move is an outright blunder.  The reason being is that this move will allow white to win back his Q after 9.Ne5+.} 9. Ne5+ Ke8 {I had different feasibility's.  But, for several reasons, this is the best move for black.  As noted earlier, however, he is about to get something back.} 10. Nxc4 Bf5 {At this point, my goal is to continue with development.  But, he is already far ahead in this process.} 11. d3 {In this postion, he intends to develop his DSB.  Also feasible was 11.b3, but I think that this move is better.} Nc6 {That, however, is not going to delay me from developing.  I decided that since I'm behind in the process, that I would start by getting as many pieces out as I can, at once.} 12. Bf4 {This is how he develops his piece.  He also had other places to put it, but for some reason, I like this move the best.} e6 {In this position, however, I am also determined to develop my B.  So, I decide to follow what white did on move 11.} 13. O-O-O {He also could have castled Kingside, and in my opinion, that would have been better.  Of course, however, I am the kind of person that often likes to castle short because that is what I was originally taught.  The only problem with that is that myevilluck, the former mentor for the, "Walking the Walk and Learning How to Run" club told me that you can't play a move just because that's how you were taught.  On the one hand, I agree with his assessment because it's a bad idea to make a move without having a good reason for doing so.  On the other hand, some of what he told me is void and invalid because he is no longer my mentor for the club.  It really depends on what therealjimfriar has to say since he is the current for the same club.} Be7 {In the meantime, my development is pretty much complete.  The only thing to figure out is what way I plan to castle, and if it's feasible to do so.  At this point, however, Fred said, "to easy".  At first, I thought he was asking if I thought that it was easy.  I told him that it seems extremely easy, but the answer is no.  That is because has repeatedly said, "It's not so easy".  And, that statement was reiterated by GM Judit Polgar, in her commentary for the Alkehine tournament, and a different video where she defeats Grandmaster Karpov.  However, he then clarified by stating, "lol no this is easy for me".} 14. f3 {I do not know why he moved here.} Kf7 {In this position, I wanted to bring the Rooks together with the King behind, so it is about King safety.  However, better was to do the thing that I'm obsessed, castle.  I cannot believe that I forgot to do this.} 15. h4 {I still do not know what he intends to do, in this position.  } Rhf8 {In the meantime, I start the process of King safety, as mentioned earlier.} 16. g4 {But, he decides to kick my bishop.} e5 {? On the other hand, I decide to do the same thing to his B.  Unfortunately, I get distracted and miss the threat.  If I had looked more carefully, I would have seen the threat.  As it turns, this loses a pawn, after he places me in check.  That's because after 17.Nxe5+, it will not be possible for me to retake because if then 17...Nxe5??, 18.Bxe5, losing a piece for a pawn. } 17. Nxe5+ Kg8 {Despite the mistake, this is the move that I had been planning to play 14...Kf7.  Now that everything is in tact, I am completely developed.  However, the interesting factor is that we will be exchanging during the next couple of moves.  The only disadvantage is that I am behind a pawn.  } 18. Nxc6 bxc6 19. gxf5 Rxf5 20. Rde1 {? For some reason, he decides to attack my DSB, but I am not bothered by it.  Instead, I view this move as a mistake because we are about to exchange material.  This time, however, after we exchange, I will win a pawn back, so that everything is even again.  Therefore, I believe that black is no longer at a disadvantage.  Let's see how long this lasts.} Rxf4 21. Rxe7 Rxf3 22. Rc7 {However, I miscalculated something important.  Since those pawns are doubled, he decides to attack one of them.  Which means that he is about to win a back, and there is nothing that I can do about it.  This is the disadvantage of having doubled, and now we all know why I make a big deal out of these things.  There might be more to chess then this, but this type of situation can make a big difference in a game.  And, this is the logic behind it.} Raf8 {Knowing that the pawn is lost anyway, I decide to double up my rooks.  That's because doubled rooks can be extremely dangerous, as I have repeatedly mentioned in other annotations.} 23. Rxa7 Rf3f7 {So, at this point, my goal is to put pressure on the seventh rank.  The other story is that I want to confine his position, but unfortunately, the plan is not going to work.} 24. Ra5 {That's because the joke is now on me.  With this he is automatically going to win my c5 pawn, as mentioned on move 25.} Rf7f1+ {But, that does not stop me from placing him in check.  In addition, this move forces a rook exchange.  The goal is to delay his plan for, as long as, possible.  Not only that, but I want to get as many pieces off the board as possible.  That's because I still have a fight in me and am willing to do battle, until the end.} 25. Rxf1 Rxf1+ 26. Kd2 {Forced, and that is exactly what I wanted, so one of my goals worked.  I really wanted to force into making a certain move, as it's psychological.  If he is forced to do something, I generally hope that my opponents get overworked and hand over the advantage.  Usually, that's how it happens, and it has caused me to pull a swindle in a couple of past games.  By this, I'm alluding to a victory in a lost position.  Of course, the Master Mater is not going to get stressed over a forced move, but it still proves that I'm no where near ready to resign yet.  That's because when I first joined the site and for the first few years, I used to resign in this kind of position.  In fact, I gave up, as soon as, I gave up something like a pawn.  That's when Jack Stockel has repeatedly said, "Don't give up right away.  Start thinking."} Rf5 {At the last minute I found a different move, but it is the only move that protects my c pawn.  However, things are about to take an interesting turn, as we will see shortly.} 27. Ra6 {Because of this move, I have to think of a way to protect c6.  As it turns out, 27...Rf6 is the only way to do it.} Rf6 28. a4 {At first, I had no idea why he played, but as it turns out, his intentions are to promote.  As we will see later on, this is the pawn that will become a Q.  However, it makes perfect sense because in the past, Jack Stockel has repeatedly told me that one of the best ways to promote a pawn is by bringing it directly behind the R.  By this, I am alluding to the same file, so directly vertical from one another.  } h6 {In the meantime, I am also determined promote and win his h pawn, at the same time.  28...Rh6 was also possible, but it certainly would not have been more useful then this move.  If I had been able to ...RxP, white would respond with RXP, so that move would not have accomplished anything.  This move, however, achieves very little.  The only useful thing are that the pawns are connected which usually brings you a step closer to promotion.  That's what I thought.  In fact, I wrongly assumed that this was a passed pawn and that I could just move my way by sliding these pawns together (e.g ...h5, ...g6), and vica versa.  However, the plan is not going to work.  I quickly figured out that he would take one of those pawns, and if I were to still attempt a promotion, White's King would stop me dead in my tracks.  And, I kept that in mind before continuing my attempts.} 29. a5 {Still attempting the promotion.} g5 {But, so am I, and in the same way that I had mentioned earlier.  I was hoping for an exchange.  30.hxg5, hxg5.  However, I forgot to look at two things.  First, I wouldn't get a promotion because of Fred's K.  Second, I am not going to get the exchange that I had attempted.} 30. Rb6 {Instead, he brings moves his R to the right.  During the game, I had no idea why.  However, I figured out the answers afterwards.  This move almost guarantees the promotion because his pawn now has room to make a Q, whereas, it didn't before.  BTW, this is part of the advantage to having your R directly in front of the P.  The only thing that white has to look out for is that I might play ...Rf8.  But, a second look shows that it won't be much of a help.  That's because even if I could stop a promotion, he would be able to win my f8 R, at best.  The logic behind this is that he could simply play Rb8, before I even get the chance to place my Rook on the eighth rank.} g4 {I realize now that I could have taken with 30...gxf5, but that certainly would not stop his plans.  Of course, it wins a pawn back, but he would certainly get that and then some once he plays a8 =Q.  However, I am not quite ready to resign yet.} 31. Rb8+ {This is part of his plan, as mentioned earlier.  When I think about it, I could have exchanged with 31...Rf8, 32.Rxf8, Kxf8.  But, it's pointless due to his a pawn.  As implied earlier, that's the pawn that will eventually result in my downfall.} Kg7 {So, I decide to get out of check, with this move.  What gives?   No move is better then the other, at this point.} 32. a6 {He' still getting ready to do the inevitable.} g3 {But, I attempt a scheme of my own.  At this point, I was hoping and a little optimistic about turning a game into a draw.  The reason being is that when two pawns promote right after each other, the game usually ends in a draw.  However, that will not be the case with the master mater.  At this point, I am just going to have a little more confidence because I can't go wrong by becoming overly confident.  That only happens when you're in a winning position and allow your opponent to pull a swindle by underestimating him or her.  However, in the scenario, I'm in a losing position, so the more confident I am, the more I will learn.  As it turns out, I'm already learning more about the position then I expected} 33. a7 {And, this is his final step before the Q.} g2 {But, the same can now be said for black.  And, we are both about to promote, on our next moves.  The only thing is that white still has an overwhelming winning position, even after the promotion.  So, I just go for brokes, but it was well worth the attempt.} 34. a8=Q g1=Q 35. Rg8+ {That's because of this check.  And, I can't get out of it by taking Fred's R, due to the promotion.  Not only that, but to make matters worse, my Q is now pinned due to the R fork that he has.  Therefore, when all is said and done, white will end up with a Q ahead.  In addition, it is the endgame, so there's no compensation for what I'm about to lose.  So, I resigned on the grounds that any hopes for a swindle are gone.}
