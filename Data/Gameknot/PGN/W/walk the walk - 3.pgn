[Opening "Petrov three knights game (C42)"]

1. e4 {My first match in the new "Walking The Walk" club pitting lower ranked players against 2000+ GK players. I was wary of playing 1. e4, the "Open Game" move against what is sure to be a better tactical player (and how right I was!) but then again they also say you have to play what you know so here we go :) GK analysis can be found here http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16424407&rnd=0.6628477014601231} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {The Petrov, not a defense I face often or enjoy facing either, I decide to see if my opponent will enter a more passive three or four knights game.} 3. Nc3 Bb4 {This move has a higher percentage win for white than transposing into a four knight's game with 3. Nc6, however I know that my opponent is doing their best to open this game up and force me to crack. } 4. Nxe5 {That being said perhaps I should have played 4. Bc4 staying away from more open lines, but 4.Ne5 had 42%/18%/38% Win/Loss/Draw for White so I thought why not, let's see where the database can take me...} O-O {Pretty much all moves here end up at the same position with just a difference of move orders...} 5. Nd3 Bxc3 6. dxc3 Nxe4 7. Be2 Re8 8. O-O {White is castled and pretty well developed, Black is castled but has no queenside development of which to speak. Despite the doubled c-pawns it's no doubt that White has a winning edge amongst true GMs, IMs, and Masters. White needs to be the one to press lines here and take advantage of their open lines.} d6 9. Nf4 Nc6 10. c4 Bd7 11. Nd5 {White's knight has found a good post on d5 while Black catches up on development. The white DSB is poised to control the long diagonal now that black will have a harder time contesting it.  } Ne7 {We're down to two games left in the GK database. Black doesn't want to leave the strong knight on d5 while White is ok to trade it since it will fix his pawn structure. That being said the pawn will not be well supported as it is a bit extended. } 12. f3 {This still follows the GK database with a win for White. The other option, 12. Bf3 lead to a draw. I did  consider that move and probably should have played it, this move is a bit more aggressive but opening the structure around the king is certainly problematic. } Nxd5 13. cxd5 Nc5 14. Bd2 Qh4 {The first novelty of the game. I took my time here and tried to really understand the position. The game we had been following so far continued with 14... Qf6 15. Bc3. The text move gives the queen some more mobility but I figured the main threat was still on d4 so continued the same.} 15. Bc3 Na4 {However this allows the strong move by black which will rob White of one their key advantages, the DSB. GK engine recommends the very computer-like 15. Rf2 Re7 16. Ba5 but playing 15. Ba5 immediately also seems fine, that being said going back to move 15 it's still hard for me to find a good move or plan, Ba5 was never a move that I even considered. } 16. g3 {Given how this game continued I would have much preferred the recommended 16. Re1 but I was thinking at the time that I would be able to get the queens off the board early and perhaps hold on longer. I even toyed with 16. g3 Nc3 17. gh4 Nd1 18. Bd1 but then even I could see the cracks or shall we say grand canyon gaps in White's position. } Nxc3 17. bxc3 Qa4 18. Bd3 {I want to contest the e-file but was probably better to position the rook first. } Qa5 19. c4 Bh3 20. Re1 {Now Rf2 was essential to block the check on c5 and stop the queen from infiltrating but I was still focused on contesting that file. } Qc5+ 21. Kh1 Qf2 22. Re2 {Here I thought I had covered all my bases and forced a rook and queen trade yet I missed a mate in one. White's position has certainly fallen apart, the "best" way forward is 22. Bf1} Bg2# {I certainly had fun trying to defend against the onslaught hopefully I can last longer in my current game against ionadowman :) Any and all comments are welcome, hope you enjoyed the game!}
