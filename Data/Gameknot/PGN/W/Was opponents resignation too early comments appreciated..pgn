1. e4 {Good evening annotated section likers. i have a short and sorta sweet one to ask advice on.} e5 {this is about our 8th game against each other. sadly for my opponent, I won 7 and we drew one.  i am not picking on this person nor do I consider myself a teacher, but he keeps challenging me after each game and there is no bad verbal exchanges between each other.} 2. d4 {so i see no reason as why not to grant him the games. i personally dont mind losing versus higher rated opponents just for the greater learning curve. so im able to indulge someone else too.} exd4 {my opponent isnt aggressive at all. he has some sharp play when the game stays pretty classical, but each time i threw in a sacrifice of a bishop rook or knight in our previous games the following moves after is when his empire crumbled.} 3. Qxd4 {and so i believe i had a pretty good grasp of how my opponent plays. Pure defense waiting for his opponent to make a mistake.   this is the cause for my e4  d4 opening with the queen recapture.   ill try a aggressive line i havent played in a year here. instead of my classic bishops opening. ill try to not give my opponent anytime to set up a strong defensive structure as to not make this game a 50 move mind boggle like the last 3.  have to keep my opponent guessing.} d6 {hes been managing to make each successive game longer and longer, (its as if hes getting used to my antics :D).  i was not surprised at all to not see nc6 here.   our last 3 games also my opponent withheld his castle until after i castled without ever posing any threat to any of my castle opportunities. } 4. Nc3 {my opponent was wise in his defense.  not always trading. but always traded my LSB if i gave him the chance or would trade out any of my pieces that i was setting up to potentially cause a hole in his wall.  } Be6 {already taking a backrow position with his LSB. ill hold mine back as long as possible not to invite pawn growth queen side or get a forced exchange or loss of tempo.} 5. b3 {i didnt feel sending my DSB king side to be wise either not to induce pawn set ups he would like so i thought putting my DSB on b2 to be wiser this game, and holding my stronger pieces for long distance attacks.} Be7 {my opponent really liked keeping his development slow and as you can see he is keeping both castle options alive as long as possible} 6. Bb2 {and so i go on with my plan and told myself ill queen side castle and if he makes 1 or 2 more passive moves im trying to bust in right away} Bf6 {passive move 1 but prevents the immediate castle. so he still has 2 in bank he can play} 7. Qa4+ c6 {why am i not surprised he didnt develop his knight.} 8. O-O-O {i was really hoping to induce a b5 pawn here and was going to sacrifice a knight or my LSB and just see what happens after his replies} Qc7 {but to my surprise he played this move.  i reanalysed my plan and his queen move just solidifies which piece i got to sacrifice. the LSB not the knight,} 9. Bc4 {and so i play this to induce b5.  i really thought he would play b5 over Bxc4} b5 {and he did!} 10. Bxb5 {chomp} cxb5 {retake} 11. Nxb5 {chomp. thinking.... thinking...... thinking...... thinking........ opponent resigns.        personally i was "going with the flow"  but was this attack so strong to merit a resignation?  i can easily get his rook. but can i get a checkmate or his queen? i didnt even have time to analyse all the avenues of this nice play or if it even was.  well id like some comments on this one if anyone would indulge me.}
