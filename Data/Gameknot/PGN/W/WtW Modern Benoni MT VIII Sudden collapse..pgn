1. d4 {Another game from Modern Benoni Tournament VIII.  From an even opening, White makes a slip that allows Black to win a pawn.  Shortly afterwards Black returns it to obtain a far advanced passed pawn on the Q-side.  White's defences seem to be holding until two apparently insignificant errors in a row puts the game out of White's reach.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 {The starting point: the real narrative begins here.} 6. g3 {The Fianchetto line.  White begins solidly and in fairly non-committal fashion.  At some point she may be considering bringing the King's knight out via f3 and d2 to c4 - a thematic spot for the knight.  This would be accompanied or followed by a general expansion in the centre, intending to break through at e5.  This is just one of several plans she could have adopted.  Also playable at this juncture are 6.e4 and 6.Nf3.} g6 {Thematic.  It is possible for Black to develop the bishop at e7, or perhaps to delay its development for the moment, but in my view, the fianchetto is so called for, it might as well be carried out at once.} 7. Nf3 {White could as well have played Bg2 at once.  I do not believe though that the change in move order is independently significant.} Bg7 8. Bg2 Na6 {In a lot of Benoni games you will find ...0-0 at this point, or ...a6, or even ...Qe7.  In this line, the knight is intended to pull back to c7, putting pressure upon d5, and also supporting the subsequent pawn expansion (...a6; ...b5) on the Q-side.  Again, one plan - or at least, one approach to a plan - among many possible.} 9. O-O O-O {A transposition, really.  Chances are had I castled a move earlier I would have followed with ...Na6 here.  But equally possible is 8...0-0 9.0-0 Qe7.  I have played both lines in Correspondence Chess (in the distant past), with good success.} 10. h3 {A move associated with Viktor Korchnoi.  Its purpose is to deny Black the use of g4 (often a place where a bishop, or sometimes a knight arrives to outflank White's centre).  His right flank thus guarded, White plans in the centre may go ahead the more smoothly.  That is (or was) the idea, at any rate.} Re8 {Delaying the advance of White's e-pawn.  After 10...Nc7  11.e4 b5?!  12.e5! is 'very strong', according to Bill Hartston.  Meanwhile, the game Korchnoi-Tal USSR Championship, 1962 went 11...Nd7  12.Re1 Ne8, and Black's game never really did get going after that.  Although he did conjure up play on the Q-side, White always had the ascendancy in the centre and on the K-side, where they counted.} 11. Nd2 {Thematic: in support of the e-pawn's advance, but also interested in the c4-square.} Nc7 {Equally thematic, and equally dual in function.  This makes way for and supports Black's planned Q-side expansion.  But it also has a wee bit of an eye on d5.} 12. a4 {Inhibiting Black's expansion before it even begins.} b6 {More often it is the a-pawn that moves first.  There is, however, a potential downside to that, namely 12...a6  13.a5 - a real nuisance if I want my Q-side play to counter-balance White's operations in the centre.  This way, when the time is right I can force the b-pawn forward without worrying about axb6e.p.} 13. Re1 {Further preparation for the e-pawn's drive...} Ba6 {!? Now, why this?  I'll be honest, and say I got it from the GK Database.  It serves two possible functions: to keep the White knight out of c4, but also to put pressure on the e2-square.  Black will want to advance his Q-side pawns, so the bishop will eventually have to make way for the a-pawn...} 14. Nde4 {If c4 is off limits, we'll try e4 instead, thinks the knight...} Nxe4 15. Nxe4 f5 {Slightly weakening, but it relieves the pressure on d6.} 16. Nc3 Qf6 {On the way to e5, given the chance.  The pawns at e2 and d5 have attracted the interest of the Black queen...} 17. Bd2 {There is a fair bit of pressure on White's Q-side and centre, yet so far not enough to make her feel  uncomfortable.  But one gets the feeling at this point that Black is having the easier task finding moves. } Re7 {The point of aim is e2.  Black wants to double rooks on the e-file.} 18. e3 {The pawn seeks the protection of his compadre on f2.  Doubling Blacks rooks gets shuffled down the agenda.  But now the hole at d3 beckons.} Bd3 {Occupying such a position with a bishop is very hard to resist, so I didn't resist it.  It does put a bit of a crimp in White's game, but it has another virtue...} 19. Bf1 {... It induced this obvious response, that turns out to be a mistake, as the sequel will show.  The GK engine gives a counter-attack beginning 19.Qb3 the preference, but it's not very convincing.  I was pretty sure White would play the way she did.} Bxf1 {It is always hard to exchange off such an active piece for one on its home square, but this is a means to an end.} 20. Rxf1 Qf7 {The White d-pawn comes under a siege.} 21. Qf3 {The relief column props up the pawn for the moment, but other support is to be cut.} Bxc3 {(!) Ordinarily one gives up a fianchetto bishop extremely reluctantly, even when winning a pawn; especially if ones opponent retains the same-colour bishop.  But here, White will find it not so easy to do much with the weakened dark squares in Black's K-side.} 22. bxc3 {From this I infer that White concluded that taking with the bishop constituted a loss of time after ...Nd5.  Or maybe she hoped to induce an exchange of Queens by leaving the bishop loose on d2.  But it seems likely, too, that she figured that it would be easier to hold up Black's Q-side with a c-pawn available...} Qxd5 {(!?) Probably Black could have finessed a little here by ...c4, as the White d-pawn wasn't going anywhere.  This capture forced the Queens off, which probably suited White as well as Black.} 23. Qxd5+ Nxd5 24. Rfb1 {Very cunning and rather awkward to meet.  But White might have been better off playing 24.c4! first, then bring the rook across.  Or maybe after Black moved his Knight to c7, then played 25.c4.} Nc7 {Black still wants to capitalise on his Q-side pawn majority, but White has ensured the pawns may not advance.  The knight will give the pawns a boost up...} 25. f3 {At this point, White lost me a bit.  Possibly this was simply marking time, or else she was preparing a K-side pawn storm of some sort.  Probably now was the time for 25.c4!} d5 26. Kf2 c4 {Again, one does not normally cripple ones own majorities in this way, and I subjected it to a bit of thought before playing it.  Its purpose is to tie down White's Q-side.  Right now, Black is speculating upon what might be mined out of the b3 and d3 squares.} 27. Kg2 {Definitely marking time.  White has no positive plan at this point, so adopts a wait and see policy: 'OK, let's see what you've got!'} d4 {(!) This.  Black exploits the half-pin that has suddenly appeared in the e-file.  Yes: the e-pawn is pinned against an empty square - the crucial point being that 28.exd4 Re2ch loses the bishop.} 28. cxd4 {Black has ceded White the central Majority.  But it's in a good cause...} Nd5 {More than blockading the d-pawn, The Knight establishes a demesne over the b4, c3, and e3 squares.} 29. Rbe1 {Keeps the pawn.  I thought White might have played 29.Kf2, but after 29...c3 thinks look very dire: [a] 30.Bc1 Rae8; or [b] 30.Rb5 Nc7  31.Bxc3 Nxb5 winning the exchange.} c3 30. Bc1 Rae8 {White's centre is coming in for a terrible battering, but it's still holding up...} 31. Kf2 Nb4 {I like this move, outflanking White's Maginot Line of pawns, and threatening forks at c2 and d3.} 32. Rd1 {(?) I suspect Jo was distracted by other things at this point (planning a vacation).  Instead 32.Re2 kept White in the fight.} c2 {And after this pawn thrust I was expecting the rook to go to f1 or g1.} 33. Rd2 {(?) The final mistake, and this really is costly.} Re7xe3 {The breakthrough.  In the sequel, White must lose at least a piece, so she resigned. [0-1]}
