1. c4 {In this Division, player have to be rated ECF 100 or less or ungraded. White starts with an English opening.} e5 {Black turns it into a Reversed Sicilian} 2. g3 {A usual continuation.} Nc6 {Black develops} 3. Bg2 {White continues the fianchetto} f5 {Black seizes control of central squares. Also quite widely played, with good results.} 4. e3 {Slightly weakens the f3 square, but playable.} Nf6 {Black wisely develops.} 5. Qf3 {A dreadful blunder. White needs to continue developing knights and castling and developing Bc1. It is a waste of time. The queen is very vulnerable on this square. Now 5...e5 6. Qf4 Nb4 is very strong, as is Nb4 immediately.} d6 {But black continues to develop.} 6. Ne2 {Suicidal! cutting of the queen's retreat is asking for trouble.} h6 {Threatening 7...e4 8. Qf4 g5 winning the queen, but this is easily met. Again e5-e4 followed by Nb4 is strong, as is Nb4 immediately.} 7. Nec3 {White spotted the threat and gives his queen a retreat path.} e4 {Black finally advances.} 8. Qe2 {The queen drops back.} Ne7 {Again 8...Nb4 was still good, as was Ne5 eyeing the f3 and d3 squares.} 9. b3 {Protecting c4 and maybe preparing to develop Bc1.} c5 {Black gains space in the centre.} 10. a4 {Not sure what the idea was here.} d5 {Another central advance.} 11. cxd5 {White takes.} Nexd5 {Black find the correct way to recapture.} 12. O-O {White wisely castles. Black too, could have been advised to prepare castling with Be7. Nb4 is now a pssobility again too.} b6 {But he decides to prepare to develop his Bc8.} 13. Rd1 {White correctly plans to open the centre with d2-d3, while the black king is still in the centre - a good plan. Black could have cut across this plan with Nb4 .} Bb7 {But black continues with his plan} 14. d3 {The break comes.} exd3 {Black falls in with white's plans. This move can't be right. Maybe 14...Qe7 is better?} 15. Rxd3 {White now has a very powerful pin on the d file.} Qd7 {Black now has a lost position. 15,,,,Ba6 is probably best.} 16. e4 {White does the central break. This move is strong, but white could have also just picked up a piece by exploiting the pin on the d file by taking on d5 - 16. Nxd5 Nxd5 17. Bxd5 Bxd5 18. Nc3 or 16. Nxd5 Bxd5 17. Nc3.} fxe4 {White takes.} 17. Nxe4 {Black recaptures, threatening all sorts of discovered checks on the king.} Qe7 {Better is 0-0-0} 18. Nd6+ {White comes in with the check.} Kd8 {The king has to move.} 19. Qxe7+ {White exchanges before taking the bishop. If 19. Nxb7+ Qxb7 and black is still in the game.} Bxe7 {Black finally develops his Bf8} 20. Nxb7+ {The bishop goes.} Kc7 {The knight has no escape squares.} 21. Bxd5 {But a piece goes here.} Nxd5 {Black takes.} 22. Rxd5 {Rook takes. Now black can't capture the knight immediately as 22....Kxb7? 23. Rd7+! and the Be7 goes, so...} Bf6 {Black attacks the rook.} 23. Ra2 {Rook moves.} Kxb7 {Knight goes.} 24. Re2 {Rook develops.} Rad8 {Black challenges the rook.} 25. Nc3 {White throws away all his hard work!} Bxc3 {Knight goes.} 26. Rxd8 {Rook takes.} Rxd8 {Rook takes back, with the threat of Rd1+ winning the Bc1.} 27. Kg2 {And draw agreed....}
