1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 {All the games in this themed mini start here.} 6. Nf3 g6 7. e4 Bg7 8. Bd3 O-O {Standard development through here.} 9. h3 Re8 {Sliding over to pressure the KP.} 10. O-O c4 {Pressing the B.} 11. Bc2 b5 {Must support my advanced P.} 12. Nxb5 Nxe4 {I'll gladly trade a wing Pawn for a central one.} 13. Bxe4 Rxe4 {Completing the exchange of minors.} 14. Bg5 Bf6 {Interposing.} 15. Bxf6 Qxf6 {More wood vanishes.} 16. Nc7 Bb7 {Ooopsie. Didn't see the knight's move. Well, I'll have to settle for being down an Exchange.} 17. Nxa8 Bxa8 {Now I have to launch an attack. Passive play will lose slowly but surely.} 18. Rc1 Nd7 {Time to move some pieces forward!} 19. b3 Nb6 {Guarding my own Pawn, and attacking White's.} 20. Nd2 Rd4 {If I go down, it will be fighting. "If this is to be our end, then let it be such an end as to be worthy of remembrance."} 21. bxc4 Qf4 {Adding more pressure to the pinned Knight.} 22. Rc2 Nxc4 {Inadvertently offering White a winning simplification [23 RxN RxR 24 NxR QxN, and with a Q and R vs. a Q and B, the ending is a technically easy win for White.]} 23. g3 Qg5 {A mistake. I should have played 23... RxN. Now I lose a piece outright.} 24. Rxc4 Bxd5 {Still fighting on... but I lose another piece to oversight.} 25. Rxd4 Qf5 {The only reason I'm still playing is because I had posted a comment on the game and was waiting for White to respond to it.} 26. Nb3 {He responded, and I resigned.}
