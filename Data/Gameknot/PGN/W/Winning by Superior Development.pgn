1. d4 c5 2. c3 {Weak} d5 3. b3 {very weak} Nf6 4. e3 {White moves 4 pawns in a row.} Nc6 5. dxc5 {That's 5 consecutive pawn moves.} e5 6. b4 {make that six} a6 7. Bb2 Be6 8. a3 {White has made 7 pawn moves and his dark-square bishop might as well count as a pawn.} Be7 9. Nf3 O-O 10. h3 {Black's already completed his development and White pushes the h-pawn, weakening his king's position. That's 8 pawn moves for White.} e4 11. Nd4 Ne5 12. Be2 Nfd7 {Black tries to open the F-file.} 13. Nd2 Re8 14. Nxe6 {White makes it easy for Black.} fxe6 15. Nf1 Rf8 16. g3 {A ninth pawn move that further weakens White's position.} Nf3+ {Now the exchange is forced.} 17. Bxf3 Rxf3 {Of course not exf3??} 18. Nh2 Rf7 19. O-O {"castling into it"} Ne5 {The Black knight will dominate the board on either d3 or c4.} 20. Kg2 Nd3 21. Qc2 Rc8 22. Rad1 {Black will avoid the exchange sacrifice.} Ne5 23. a4 {That's 10 pawn moves by White.} b6 24. Qe2 Nc4 25. cxb6 Qxb6 26. a5 Qc7 27. Rdc1 {White is forced into a passive position.} Bd6 28. h4 {yet another pawn move (11)} h6 29. Rc2 g5 30. Bc1 {Black should play Rg7 here.} gxh4 31. Qg4+ Rg7 32. Qxh4 h5 {White dare not take the pawn.} 33. Kh1 Qf7 34. Rg1 Ne5 35. Qf4 {Trying to trade queens} Qg6 36. Rg2 {White is holding the fort, but the fort will eventually succumb.} Rf8 37. Qh4 Be7 38. Qh3 {The only square} Nd3 {Most of White's pieces have been crammed into the corner. White's other two pieces are horribly placed.} 39. Bd2 {White was almost in zugzwang and now blunders.} Nxf2+ 40. Rxf2 Rxf2 {White should have resigned here.} 41. Nf1 h4 42. g4 Bd6 43. Rc1 Qxg4 44. Qxg4 Rxg4 45. Be1 {All of White's pieces are back on the first rank.} Rfg2 {Now mate is inevitable. Black could sacrifice the bishop with Bf2, but then Black's up a whole rook, and mate is still threatened.} 46. c4 Rg2g1# {Puts an end to White's misery}
