1. Nf3 {White begins with the Reti opening.} a6 {A very unorthodox move for black.  I suppose he is just toying with me, or perhaps he is providing a handicap in order to give me a chance.  I am sure there is a name for this defense but I don't know what it is.  The GameKnot database says that there have only been 83 people in the history of the universe that have ever used this response to the Reti.} 2. d4 {White pushes the d pawn rather than the c which means that we are no longer following Reti.  I was spooked away from pushing the c because I thought my opponent had something up his sleeve.  } e6 {Black opens the diagonals for the Queen and Bishop.  This strikes me as a conservative move.  Not showing any aggression here.} 3. Bf4 {Developing a Bishop.} Nf6 {Developing a Knight.} 4. c4 {I push the c pawn which discorages the black d pawn from coming forward and it also opens a diagonal for my Queen.} Be7 {Another conservative move for black.  This allows him to castle on the next move if he desires to do so.} 5. Nc3 {Developing my other horse.} d5 {Here comes that d pawn that I was expecting.  The black d pawn is protected in 3 ways.} 6. cxd5 {I decide to swap pawns.  The experts say that center pawns are worth more than the others, so if I can take a d pawn with a c pawn then it seems like a good idea to me.} Nxd5 {Black evens up the score using his horse.  This threatens the unprotected white Bishop which perhaps should never have been placed there to begin with.} 7. Bd2 {The white Bishop tucks his tail and retreats whilst giving a little more support to the white Knight.} O-O {Black castles.  Another solid conservative move.} 8. e4 {White now has a pawn on e4 and d4 supported by Knights on c3 and f3.  In all the books I have read, this is a really good thing for white.  This is the classic center-controlling set up that people drool over.  I am feeling really good at this point.} Nxc3 {Black decides to swap Knights.  This negates my protection on e4.  } 9. bxc3 {White evens the score.  I opted to take the Knight with the b pawn instead of the Bishop.  In my opinion its a good idea to support your center pawns with other pawns rather than with pieces.  This gives my Bishop a chance to do other things rather than to babysit with pawns.} c5 {Black attacks my precious center pawns which I was so proud of.  Looks like they won't stay there for long.} 10. Rb1 {White ignores the pawn threat because the d pawn is so nicely protected by the c pawn.  White decides to take control of that empty b file.  In the books that I have read, it says that controlling territory is a good thing.} Nc6 {Black piles more threats on d4 and develops a Knight in the ordinary fashion.} 11. Be3 {I am trying with all my might to maintain my beautiful e4 and d4 which everyone tells me is such a wonderful thing to behold.} cxd4 {Black hammers away at my wall.} 12. cxd4 {Once again, I have my d4 and e4 back.  I am so proud.  My d4 is protected with 3 pieces.  My e4 has no protection at all.  That could be a bad omen.} Qa5+ {Now we see that white should never have moved the Rook to b.  The black Queen executes a lovely forking maneuver threatening both the King and the a pawn.} 13. Bd2 {I decide not to block the check with my Queen, because then the black Bishop would come down and give me a nasty Skewer.  By blocking with my Bishop I lose a pawn, but the alternative would be really bad.} Qxa2 {As expected white loses a4 and goes a point down.} 14. Be2 {I suppose the Queen scared me and I am now preparing to castle.} Rd8 {Black threatens d4} 15. Ra1 {White ignores the threat on d4 and decides to play "chase the queen."} Qb2 {The queen ducks away.} 16. Rb1 {White continues with this game of "chase the queen." } Qa3 {The queen ducks away again.} 17. Ra1 {White continues to pester.} Qd6 {Black Queen finally takes the hint.  White d4 now has 3 threats and only one protector.} 18. Bc3 {White adds two protectors to d4.} Rb8 {Black prepares to push the b pawn.  I am now thinking that my last move should have been Bishop to e3 rather than c3.} 19. O-O {White takes the opportunity to castle.} b5 {As expected, black pushes the b pawn.  No threat yet but it will be soon.} 20. e5 {White decides to abandon the classic e4 d4 pawn structure to continue the game of "chase the queen."  I can't really claim that e4 and d4 was doing me any good, but all the books say that it is such a wonderful thing.  I guess I am proud that I could maintain those 2 soldiers for as long as I did.} Qc7 {I scared the black queen away.  This makes me happy.  It takes some pressure off of d4.  The black queen is now in a cramped place.} 21. Qd2 {I made this move to control more territory, to allow my Rooks more freedom to move on the back row and I was also thinking about executing a Skewer by putting my Bishop on a5.} b4 {Here comes that b pawn that I was expecting.  Once again, I am wishing that I had put that Bishop on e3 rather than c3. } 22. Bb2 {My bishop retreats while keeping the protection on d4.} Nxe5 {Here is a brilliant move which shows why my opponent is a 2164.  I would have never thought to make this move.  White goes 2 points down.} 23. Qf4 {I thought this was a good response.  The d4 pawn is now free to take the Knight, and the Knight does not really want to move away because QxQ.} Nxf3+ {Another brilliant move for black.  It is always a good idea to check. Now the white Queen is in trouble.} 24. Qxf3 {White gets out of the predicament and remains 2 points down.  The white d4 pawn is very lonely with no supporting pawns although not in trouble right now.} Bb7 {Now black plays chase the queen.} 25. Qg4 {White queen moves out of harms way.} Qc2 {Another nice move for black.  The b2 Bishop is nearly trapped.} 26. Rab1 {White manages to save the Bishop.} f5 {The white Queen is threatened.  The white Queen wants to protect the Bishop on e2.  She is reluctant to simply move away.} 27. Rfc1 {If you get me, then I get you.} Qxc1+ {I never would have thought of this.  This is a 2164 move.  It is brilliant. } 28. Rxc1 {White negates the check.} fxg4 {Black takes Queen.} 29. Bxg4 {At this point, white has no hope, but holds on a little longer.} Bd5 {Black defends pawn.} 30. Rc7 {White throws a last ditch threat.} Bg5 {Black negates the threat.} 31. Ra7 {White throws another threat.} Rbc8 {Black threatens checkmate.  White Resigns.  CONCLUSION: There were 2 or 3 brilliant moves executed by black, which ultimately won the game for him.  These move were completely unexpected by white.  This game demonstrates what happens when a strong player meets a mediocre one.}
