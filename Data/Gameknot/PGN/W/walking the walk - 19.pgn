[Opening "English (A22), Bellon gambit"]

1. c4 {My standard opening with white for the last 6 years. I like the variations and transpositions that mean there is never a dull game} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 {The Bremen variation which is again my preferred line} d5 5. cxd5 {Almost an automatic capture as the point of the english opening is to allow black to build a centre then destroy it. d5 cxd5 accomplishes this in one move. There are rare exceptions - see my game with hityerclock} Nxd5 6. Bg2 {And a rule of mine - if you start a fianchetto then complete it as soon as possible}} Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a4 a5 9. e3 Bg4 10. h3 Be6 11. d4 {Because I dislike Qp games i usually try to avoid playing d4 for as long as possible to make it harder for black to transpose into one of the Qp lines. However here i had no sensible alternative} exd4 12. Nxd4 Nxd4 13. exd4 c6 14. Ne4 O-O 15. Nc5 {All standard moves to here but then black started to apply the pressure building up a small but definite advantage} Bc8 16. Be3 Nd5 17. Rc1 {Much better was Re1 preparing to take control of the open file} Nxe3 18. fxe3 {splitting my pawns into 3 groups of 2 and opening up the K defenses} Bd6 19. Rf3 Qe7 20. Qc2 Re8 21. e4 Bxc5 22. dxc5 Qxe4 23. Qxe4 {Working on the principle that if your K is exposed then exchange Qs as soon as possible} Rxe4 24. Rd1 Re8 25. Rb3 h5 26. Kf2 g6 27. Re1 Rxe1 28. Kxe1 {Already thinking about engineering a draw even though a pawn down} Kg7 29. Ke2 Ra7 30. Ke3 Bf5 31. Rb6 Kf6 32. Kd4 Be6 33. h4 Ke7 34. Be4 Kf6 {And blacks last few moves, beginning with the pointless Ra7, have frittered away any advantage and so we slide into a draw} 35. Bg2 Bf5 36. Bf1 Be6 {}
