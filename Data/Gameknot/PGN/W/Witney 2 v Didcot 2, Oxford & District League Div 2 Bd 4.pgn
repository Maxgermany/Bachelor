1. d4 {Notes in "" are by John Walker from his column in the Oxford Times, 6 Jan, 1995: "Bob Jacobs supplied this exciting gamescore together with a penetrating analysis too detailed to reproduce"... Notes without "" are from my "penetrating analysis" :-)} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 Nbd7 {This is inferior according to BCO2, which dismisses it with 7 0-0 =, but it avoids the line Carl wanted to play: 6...e5 7. de de 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9 Bg5, when he reckoned 9... Re8 is best but difficult to find if you do not know the line.  I avoided it because I do not like swapping Queens early in the game.  6...Bg4 would have avoided trapping my Bishop in - unless I play vigorously from here on I get a very cramped position.} 7. O-O e5 8. d5 {More flexible is 8. Bg5 and it interferes with Black's development.} Ne8 {"Dissuading White from Bg5 and aiming for an early ... f5 himself" 8...Nc5 attacks e4 and frees the Bishop, but I wanted to get f5 in as quickly as possible.} 9. b4 {Now I have missed the opportunity to play Nc5 but I have other plans for the Knight on d7.  Additional note 2008: normal is 9. Ne1, preparing 10. f3 in response to 9...f5 and a later Nd3 to support the c5 advance.} f5 10. Qc2 f4 {I decided to disregard White's build up on the Queen side and launch a King side pawn storm.  This move shuts off the White QB and allows me to build up unmolested.  In view of what happens later, White should have taken on f5, or played 10 Bg5.} 11. Na4 {This offered me further encouragement - the White Knight is sidelined.  I thought White should play c5 straightaway, attacking d6 in order to create a weakness to attack.} g5 12. Nd2 Ndf6 {Abandoning any claim to c5 and leaving the Ne8 to hold the fort on d6 and c7.  It is heading for h5 and possibly g3 or f4 to cause complications, also freeing my Bc8, which was in danger of being shut in for good.} 13. c5 g4 {"Typical of the Classical Kings Indian we have a blocked centre with the armies massing on opposite wings.  Theory favours White but Black has a king on the end of his attack." As planned, I'm avoiding any Queen side moves which might slow down my progress.} 14. Qb3 {The main point was to cover the third rank but it turned out to be rather ineffectual for this purpose.} Nh5 15. Bb2 {I thought this was rather irrelevant but Carl pointed out that it connected his rooks, which later proved important.  What else was there anyway?  I still thought cd was needed.} Qh4 {"White is showing little feel for the demands of the position and Black's direct play seizes the initiative." ! Carl expected this.  It looked right, but I still had no clear idea how I was going to proceed.} 16. g3 {Carl thought a long time over this.  I felt that any pawn move in front of his King should now prove fatal, but how was I going to prove it?  From my later analysis, it appears that 16 h3 f3 also loses, though it is quite difficult to find the right continuation for Black.} Qh3 {Preventing the h pawn from moving.  If 17 gf 17... Nxf4 18 Qxh3 Nxe2  19 Kh1 gh and I am a piece up.} 17. Rfe1 {Threatening to trap my Queen with Bf1.  I can release the Queen with Nhf6 but then my attack disappears and White storms through the centre...} fxg3 {Threatening 18 Bf1 Qxh2 mate, so White has to retake.} 18. fxg3 {Carl was happy with this pawn structure, since I could throw no more pawns at it and he could chase my pieces away.  I began to feel that I had to do something now or I would not get another chance to attack.  The Knight retreat was still unattractive.} Rf2 {"!! A bolt from the blue... but one that Bob must have planned well in advance: his queen being otherwise imperilled." John credited me with too much foresight but I do love this move, inspired as it was by Nigel Short's Bishop sacrifice on f2 in his 17th game against Kasparov, which I had witnessed live at the Savoy. I felt a Rook sac might be on, maybe when the Bishop came to f1, but it would be too well covered by White's Rooks and I was still undeveloped on my Queen side, so I could not bring my other Rook into the attack.  Then I saw that if I could entice the King away from h2, the pawns fell and White's King might get mated.  So I looked at Rf2.  With the threat of mate on h2, White had to take.  Even if the King didn't get mated, I should recover the piece when White had to block check on f3... Incidentally, when I played through the game on my computer, it played Rf2 instantly. } 19. Kxf2 Qxh2+ 20. Ke3 Qxg3+ 21. Bf3 Bh6+ 22. Ke2 {"? This loses but, after 22. Kd3, Black exerts considerable pressure with 22...Qf2."} Qh2+ {It was only here that I realised that I wouldn't be able to take on f3 because of 23 Rg1, pinning the Queen against my King.  This move took me a long time to find - in retrospect it was obvious!} 23. Kd3 Qxd2+ 24. Kc4 c6 {"The mercenary might have settled for 24.... gxf3 25. resigns but Bob can be excused demanding more fun!" This took another long think.  It had looked as if White's King might escape.  b5 failed to cxb6ep and I did not want to move the a pawn to a6 as I wanted that for my white squared bishop.  Now dc is not possible because my bishop would skewer White's King and Queen.} 25. Qd3 {? I think that Mike Truran suggested b5, which would have lasted longer but Carl only had about 2 minutes on his clock for the next 6 moves.  cd or Rg1 might have lasted longer as well.} b5+ {"and White resigns." I always like it when a pawn delivers the coup de grace: 26. Kb3 Qxd3  27 Nc3 Qc4  28 Ka3 a5 or 26 cb Ba6  winning the Queen.  This game should really carry a health warning: "Do not try this at home kids!"  The Bc8 and Ra8 have still not moved.}
