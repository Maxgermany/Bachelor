1. e4 {This is another Walking the Walk and Learning to Run MT but unlike my last game where I lost to a high rated myevilluck I tasted victory against a much lower rated chrisforbes21 who played well, but played 2 losing blunders. I hope you enjoy!} Nc6 {Nimzowitch defense } 2. d4 d5 {This is the line Aron Nimzowitch played followed by 3.e5 Bf5} 3. e5 Bf5 4. Be3 {Developing, I think slightly better was 4.Nf3} e6 {Letting out my DSB and Queen} 5. Bd3 {Trying to force the trade} Nge7 {I protect the Bishop. I think this was necessary because if I played something else then 6.Bxf5 exf5 ruins my pawn structure,} 6. g4 Bxd3 {I think Slightly better was 6. ....Bg6} 7. Qxd3 h5 {Trying to give the f5 square to my knight} 8. g5 Nf5 {Continuing with my plan.} 9. Ne2 Nb4 {I thought a lot about this move, and I thought it was best because It forces the Queen to d2 unless you want to lose a pawn} 10. Qb5+ {? I don't really understand this move} c6 11. Qa4 {Protects c2} Nxe3 12. Na3 {?? Gives me a free Bishop} Nf5 13. Rg1 {Protects the pawn on g5} Qb6 {Attack d4} 14. g6 Nxd4 15. O-O-O {?? This is just a really bad blunder that loses a ton of material} Nxe2+ 16. Kb1 Nxg1 17. Rxg1 Qxf2 18. gxf7+ Kxf7 19. Rc1 {? Hangs the other pawn.} Qxh2 20. c3 Nd3 {Threatens Mate,} 21. Qd1 {Does not stop Mate.} Qxb2# {That's all she wrote for chrisforbes21. Please feel free to comment}
