1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 {3. ...... cxd5 - the Exchange Variation.} 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Bg4 6. Qb3 {6. Qb3 - in fact the similarities to my lost Expert Caro game end here.} dxc4 {6. ....... dxc4?? - this is the move which deserves the skull and crossbones.  Don't play this move if you value your rating points (although fortunately for Bob this game was unrated).  Over the next few moves you will see why.  Going through the World DB a suggested alternative for black would have been as follows:- 6....... Nc6 7. cxd5 Na5 8. Qa4+ Bd7 9. Bb5 a6 10. Bxd7+ Nxd7 though I think white still has the edge here.  } 7. Bxc4 {7. Bxc4 - both the b7 and f7 pawns are under the hammer.  Black decided to save the f pawn.} e6 8. Qxb7 Nbd7 9. Bf4 {9. Bf4 - here it gets nastier.} Be7 10. Bc7 {10. Bc7 - and nastier!} Qc8 {10. ....... Qc8 - the only way the Wicked Witch of the West can save herself, but .....} 11. Ba6 {11. Ba6 - ....... piling up on c8.} Nb6 {11. ....... Nb6 - Bob manages to save his queen but .....} 12. Qxc8+ Nxc8 13. Bb7 {13. Bb7 - ..... look at the terrible twins, Fou Leblanc and Fou Lenoir.  Bob must lose the exchange + pawn.} Nb6 14. Bxa8 Nxa8 15. Ba5 {15. Ba5 - Fou Lenoir extricates himself from the black camp after the damage is done.  Bob now castles to get play for his remaining rook.  I then shut out his lsb with 16. f3.} O-O 16. f3 Bf5 17. Nge2 {17. Nge2 - development.} Rb8 18. b3 Nb6 19. Bxb6 Rxb6 {19. ........ Rxb6 - Fou Lenoir trades himself in for a black horsie.  There is still too much wood on the board for it to be a white flag job for black though.} 20. Kf2 {20. Kf2 - I feel that Henry is better placed here than a kingside castle with the queens off the board - just thinking about my recent game against lighttotheright here.} Bb4 21. g4 Bd3 22. Rhd1 Ba6 {22. ....... Ba6 - black's lsb retreats to a6 but puts pressure on the self-defending horsies.  Black has the bishop pair for the exchange + pawn so I must still tread carefully.} 23. Rac1 h5 24. h3 h4 {24. ....... h4 - this is the start of a ingenious plan by Bob to try and create a passer on the h file.  Unfortunately for him it just does not come off.} 25. Na4 Rb8 26. Rc7 Bxe2 27. Kxe2 {27. Kxe2 - not sure this was a good way to go from Bob - that bishop pair did offer some counterplay.} a5 28. Rdc1 Nd5 29. Rc7c8+ Rxc8 30. Rxc8+ {30. Rxc8+ - I force a trade of Bob's remaining rook.} Kh7 31. Kf1 Nf4 {31. ...... Nf4 - I cannot avoid the loss of my h pawn so I attack black's f pawn.} 32. Rc7 f6 {32. ...... f6 - Bob pushes the f pawn out of the way but his e6 pawn will be hanging once the h pawn drops off.} 33. Nc5 Kg6 {33. ....... Kg6 - would Bxc5 been an improvement here?} 34. Rc6 Kf7 35. Rc8 Nxh3 36. Rc7+ {36. Rc7+! - this move ensures the win of the e6 pawn.} Kg8 37. Nxe6 g5 38. Kg2 {38. Kg2 - time to eject the h3 knight splitting up the black kingside pawns.} Nf4+ 39. Nxf4 gxf4 40. Kh3 {40. Kh3 - and now more prawns on toast for Henry.  Bob plays on for two more moves and then waves the white flag after Henry makes a meal of the h4 pawn.  A welcome victory.} Bd6 41. Rb7 Kf8 42. Kxh4 {}
