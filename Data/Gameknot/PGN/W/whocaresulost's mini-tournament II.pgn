1. c4 c5 {Opening with the English opening} 2. Nc3 e6 3. e3 {Pawn to e3 to allow light bishop access to diagonal and protect pawn at c4} Nc6 4. Nge2 {Developing g knight} Bd6 5. g3 {Preparing to fianchetto light bishop} Nf6 6. Bh3 {Light bishop taking control of h3 diagonal} O-O 7. O-O {Castling on king side} Ne5 8. f4 {Pawn push on f file attacking knight at e5} Nd3 9. Bg2 {Black's knight finds a safe place to lodge at d3.  I move my light bishop to g2 ready to protect e pawn when it moves up.} a5 10. e4 {Pushing e file pawn to gain centre space} b6 11. e5 {Pushing e file pawn forking bishop and knight.  Now have a pawn chain consisting of 4 pawns from h2 to e5.  Game should be mine if I don't lose it.} Ne8 12. Ne4 {Black's f6 knight retreats to f8.  I move c knight to e4 into a more central position to control more squares and threatening dark bishop} Be7 13. f5 {Black's dark bishop retreats to e7.  I push f file pawn attacking e6 pawn whilst protected by rook} Bb7 14. f6 {Black's light bishop moves to f7 possibly protecting rook and attacking knight at e4.  Pushing f file pawn forking pawn and bishop.} gxf6 15. Rf3 {Black's g7 pawn takes my f6 pawn and doubles up his pawns on f file.  I move rook to f3 in order to attack knight at d3. Whilst also threatening pawn at f6.} Qc7 16. Rxd3 {Black's queen is threatening my pawn on e5 as well as black's pawn at f6 which could threaten my knight at e4.  But I continue to take knight at d3.} f5 17. Rf3 {Black's pawn at f5 is threatening my knight at e4.  I sacrificed my knight and instead moved my rook back to f3.  } fxe4 18. Re3 {Black captures my knight at e4 and I bring rook to e3 to halt e pawn's progress.  Both light colored bishops are on same diagonal as e4 pawn.  [I think I would have stayed on this file if I was black as he risks losing rook as well if the bishop moves.]} Ba6 19. Bxe4 {Black's light colored bishop moves to a6 and I take pawn at e4.  I should continue and take black's rook if no protection is provided to it.} b5 20. Nc3 {Black pushes b file pawn attacking my pawn at c4 leaving rook unprotected.  But I did not see this and stupidly move knight to c3 which I thought may give more protection to my light bishop which is an important piece.  Must have thought it may be important in checking king.} bxc4 21. Qg4+ {Black takes my pawn at c4 doubling up his pawns on c file.  I move queen to g4 and check king.} Ng7 22. Bxh7+ {Black moves knight to g7.  I move light bishop to h7 to bring it off its square.} Kxh7 23. d4 {Black king takes my light bishop.  I push d pawn threatening c5 pawn.} Bb7 24. Ne4 {Black moves light bishop onto b7 to take control of diagonal to h8.  I move knight to e4 to bring it back into the attack.  Leaving my d4 pawn to be taken as it is no longer any use in the attack on the King.} cxd4 25. Nf6+ {Instead of black using his light bishop and taking my knight at e4 he takes my pawn at d4 and my knight moves to check the king.  Black's dark bishop is in a position to take the knight at f6.  [Black could have taken my pawn at e5 with his queen but maybe he thinks those pieces can't do anything now.]} Kh6 26. Rf3# {However black moves its king and I move my rook across to f3 which gives me the game with a discovered checkmate from my dark bishop at c1}
