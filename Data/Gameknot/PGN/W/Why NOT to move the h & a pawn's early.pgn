1. e4 {I do the kings pawn opening.} e5 {Kings pawn game.} 2. Nf3 {Not sure what opening this is called, but I generally play it. Develops the knight, while attacking the e pawn.} d6 {Defends the pawn.} 3. Bc4 {Develops my LSB, and attacks the weak f7 square.} Nd7 {...? Any idea's what the point of this move was?} 4. d4 {Center control!} a6 {Black needs to develop! My white bishop is already on the a2-g8 squares, and has no ideas of moving to b5. I think Nf6 would be good here.} 5. Nc3 {Developing yet another piece. } h6 {Black is in desperate need for development. Again, I think Nf6 is best.} 6. dxe5 {"When your development is superior to the opponents, attack!"} dxe5 {He takes back...} 7. Bxf7+ {This move is actually a big deal, as you'll see in the next couple of moves.} Kxf7 {Obvious answer.} 8. Nxe5+ {Black can't take the knight with his own, because then I win his queen with ...Nxe5, Qxd8} Ke8 {This is wrong, but I'm not really sure what to advise black to do at this point...} 9. Qh5+ {And now for the major point of this annotation! If black hadn't pressed his h pawn in the beginning and mearly developed,  he would have been able to press his g pawn, or defend in some other manner.} Ke7 {Forced.} 10. Qf7+ {The black king is in peril!} Kd6 {Again, forced.} 11. Nc4+ {Black resigns here, which is understandable. I hope this annotation has showed the importance of not pressing the h and a pawns in the opening!}
