1. d4 {Hello! I'm black in this game. The strange game name was from my opponent. No idea what he/she meant.} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. h3 Bf5 4. Nc3 h6 {I know, this is not precise, but common in my level} 5. Bf4 e6 6. a3 Bd6 7. Be5 {this was novelty for me. Usually it is bishop exchange} O-O 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 {Good exchange in my eyes} 9. e3 c5 10. Nb5 e5 {some center attack!} 11. dxc5 e4 12. cxd6 exf3 13. Nc7 {ok, this is not so good..} Qxb2 14. Bd3 {The rook will wait} Bxd3 15. cxd3 Qc3+ 16. Kf1 {This gives me nice compensation for exchange} fxg2+ 17. Kxg2 {Hopefully it will be playable even with -2 for exchange. Good position and some pawns. I should try to use my position somehow.} Qc6 18. Nxa8 d4+ 19. e4 Qxd6 20. Qb3 b6 {this knight will not escape!} 21. Rhc1 Nd7 22. Qd5 Qxd5 23. exd5 Rxa8 24. Rc7 {This will hardly be a positional win... I begun think about draw. How to force a draw here?} Nc5 25. Rd1 Rd8 26. Rxa7 Rxd5 27. Ra8+ Kh7 28. Rb8 Rd6 29. f4 Kg6 {using king as attack piece. it's needed if want to win. Or draw atleast.} 30. Kg3 Kh5 {limiting opponents king possibilities!} 31. Re8 Rg6+ 32. Kh2 {oh! I loved this! trapped king! Now I plan to N R mate. N needs to go to f3. Easy - b3,d2,f3. It would need some tempo...} Kh4 {need to go to safety first} 33. Rd8 Nb3 {ha - plan is begun!} 34. Rd7 {hmm. It looks bad. If Rb1, it'd go with my plan. I could not give up another pawn!} Rf6 35. Rb1 {Ha. Gods heard me!} Nd2 36. Rb4 {Hmm. This move looses, I think.} Rg6 {give up both pawns. going to mate. Any defense at this point? Rb1 sacrifice perhaps...} 37. f5 {And here it is!} Nf3+ 38. Kh1 Rg1# {I'm ~1500 player, so not a master level game, but nice mate, isn't it?}
