1. e4 {This is an interesting game in the Sicilian Sheveningen that was played in 1976.  I wanted to share it with everyone who hasn't seen it yet.  I found it in Alexander Belyavsky's autobiography and collection of games published by Cadogan Press.  The annotated comments are Belyavsky's alone.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. Be2 Be7 7. f4 O-O 8. O-O Nc6 9. Be3 a6 10. Qe1 Nd7 {Ulf Andersson has the reputation of being one of the leading experts on the Sheveningen Variation, and the latest resources of the position are well known to him.  Thus he chooses a new and cunning plan for Black.  The usual continuations are 10...Qc7 or 10...Nxd4; 11.  Bxd4 b5. } 11. Rd1 { } Re8 { } 12. Bc4 {White makes use of the opportunity offered to switch his bishop to an attacking diagonal (12...Na5 is not possible because of 13. Bxe6), after which the f-pawn advance becomes imminent. } Nf8 { } 13. a3 {Ensuring the safety of the main attacker. } Bd7 { } 14. Qf2 { } b5 { } 15. Ba2 { } Rb8 {If 15...Na5; 16. f5 Bf6, with the idea of blocking the diagonal with ...Nc4, White has the unpleasant 16. fe fe; 18. Nf5!} 16. f5 {Lengthening the operational diagonal of the bishop.} Ne5 {After 16...e5 White would have established permanent control over d5:  17. Nxc6 Bxc6; 18 Bd5.} 17. fxe6 { } fxe6 { } 18. Nf5 { } Nfg6 {Black prefers to give up a pawn immediately, if only to get rid of the pieces hovering over his position, since if 18...Bc8 White would have switched his attack to the d6-pawn -- 19. Bc5.  In this respect 18...b4; 19. ab Rxb4; 20. Nxd6 Bxd6; 21. Rxd6 was no better.  If 18...Qc7 White could continue the attack with 19. Qg3 g6 (19...Nfg6; 20. h4); 20. Bd4, threatening Nh6+} 19. Nxd6 { } Rf8 { } 20. Qd2 { } Rxf1+ { } 21. Rxf1 { } Qc7 { } 22. Nf5 { } Bf8 { } 23. Nd5 {This purely Sicilian pseudo-sacrifice is not so difficult to find.  Black cannot take the knight due to mate by Qxd5+ and Qg8.} Qc6 { } 24. Bd4 { } Re8 { } 25. Qf2 { } Kh8 { } 26. Nfe7 {This knight too is immune.  If 26...Bxe7; 27. Nxe7 Rxe7; 28. Qf8+ mates.

Nxd7?! and eventually won on time.  I am going to play out the strongest continuation on the board. } Qe7 {29...Nxe5 is not possible because of 30. Qh4 h6; 31. Nxd7 Nxd7; 32. Qxh6+} 30.
