1. e4 {A WTWLTR club game. } c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {3. d4} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3} Nc6 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qd2 a6 8. O-O-O {white castles long, expecting black to castle opposite and a race after each other's king to then ensue.} Qb6 9. Nb3 Be7 {9. ...Be7.  } 10. f3 h6 11. Be3 {11. Be3} Qc7 {11. ...Qc7.  Game looks even.} 12. g3 {12. g3.  Wanting to keep my option to take out black's g and h pawns open, I give the lsb an alternate way off the back rank (the queen possibly being needed for recapture if the B went to d3 for example).  } b5 13. Nd4 {13. Nd4.} Bb7 {13. ...Bb7.} 14. Kb1 O-O {14. ...0-0 and I decide not to trade the B for two pawns.} 15. g4 {15. g4.  Starting in on the black king's position (if this, should have just played 12. g4 earlier).} b4 {15. ...b4.} 16. Nce2 {pushes the night back.} d5 {16. ...d5} 17. g5 {17. g5.  A good deal of my thinking to this point has been to keep black from opening up his position.  This move kept black's dsb held back and removed a few pawns giving white a nice open file.  I hoped to deal with the pawn on b4 soon.  Perhaps should have played exd5?  comments?} hxg5 {17. ...hxg5} 18. Bxg5 {18. Bxg5.  I expect pxp will follow but hope that will be manageable.} dxe4 {18. ...dxe4} 19. Nxc6 {NxN.  Judged black's N to be dangerous and so removed it.} Qxc6 20. Bxf6 {BxN.  Ditto.  I was seeing all sorts of offensive potential in black's position.  I felt these two captures were necessary to limit black's options.  At the same time, I am now without two pieces expended with no real gain (though I had perhaps headed off trouble).  A bad expenditure?  Comments? } Bxf6 {20. ...Bxf6.  This is the last point where white is still in a reasonable solid position. I almost played the obvious fxe4, but a combination of concern over black's queen then coming to a very central location and also the (bad) idea that grabbing the b pawn and preventing the a and b pawns teaming up prompted...} 21. Qxb4 {21. Qxb4.  Now I'm not totally doomed yet.  But it's not far off.} exf3 {21. ...exf3} 22. Ng3 {22. Ng3.  Plan here was to move my lsb to e4 (two moves required), possibly causing trouble for an out-of-position black queen and possibly picking up his lsb.  Slightly surprisingly, but not really...} Qc7 {dynamic_dv sidesteps any potential trouble with 22. ...Qc7.  Drat!} 23. Bd3 {23. Bd3.  Probably the losing move.  Not bad in itself but bad because of the poorly positioned queen, which black capitalizes on with the obvious...} Rfb8 {23. ...Rfb8.  In the course of three moves, the game has shifted to where white was ok to where he is in big trouble!} 24. b3 {24. b3 I believe was my only move.  However, it sets up the final fatal position, ...a nice funnel down to the hole on c3.  I don't see this here due to (general blindness and) the immediate concern with b2.} f2 {24. ...f2.  that pawn's final position.  Nine moves left in the game, all of which reinforce that I should have captured that pawn at move 21!  I now clearly see the problem with the Queen coming to c3 and almost resign here.  But as d2 was available as a flight square, I played on a bit.  Plus, he MIGHT let me play c4!  Not wanting to lose the rook...} 25. Ne4 {I play 25. Ne4.} Bxe4 {25. ...Bxe4} 26. Qxe4 {26. Qxe4, and as expected...} Qc3 {26. ...Qc3.} 27. Kc1 {from here on, I'm on the run and will resign in 6 moves.} Rbd8 28. h4 Rac8 29. h5 Qa1+ 30. Kd2 Rxc2+ 31. Ke3 Bg5+ 32. Kf3 Rxd3+ {32. ...RxB} 33. Qxd3 {33. QxR} Qf6+ {33. ...Qf6+.  I Resign.  All routes lead to either immediate checkmate or to being pushed down to the first two ranks to checkmate.  Thank you to dynamic_dv for playing.  Good game.  Comments from club members appreciated.}
