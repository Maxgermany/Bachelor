1. d4 {Standard opening move for me} Nf6 2. f3 {Trying to play into the BDG with 1. d4 Nf6 2. f3 d5 3. e4, in more recent games I have played 2. Nc3 which I found got me to the position I wanted more frequently  The idea was from this article http://sawyerbdg.blogspot.co.nz/2011/08/blackmar-diemer-gambit-huebsch-after.html} e6 {I was not sure how to respond to this at the time, initial thoughts were e5 and Nc3 both of which would have given me a more familiar position} 3. Be3 {I ended up looking at the GameDB and the options were limited, I hadn't considered Bg5 at that point and discounted it because GameDB suggested it was more favourable for black 46%-53%  I ended up playing Be3 which seemed more favourable for white, however it cramped my normal position and didnt allow me to play e5 and blocked the a6-f1 diagonal} d5 4. Bf2 {This again was a GameDB move, which suggested it was the best option for white at this stage  I was aware of the rule of not moving a piece more than once in the opening but felt no choice, other options looking at this position could have been Nc3 but not really comfortable with the position of the bishops} c5 5. dxc5 {pawn is protected by the bishop on f2 and expecting him to play 5..Bxc5 6. Bxc5 Qa5+ to regain the bishop} Qc7 {This seems to put pressure on the c2 square with Bxc5 Bxc5 and Qxc5} 6. Nc3 {Trying to get back to development} Bxc5 7. Bd4 {elyhim: 7. Bd2 is a bad move. For one you moved the bishop three times. Second, 7...e5 will over run you in the centre  I understood what elyhim was saying about moving the bishop 3 times, I was sure he meant Bd4 - the logic I feel looking at the position is that I wanted to play Bxd4 Qxd4 which gave me more control in the centre, I didn't take into account e5 properly  Better options could have been e4 which would challenge the centre and after dxe4 fxe4 Nxe4 Nxe4 I would be able to play Nf3 and have some more emphasis on the centre. Another obvious option is Bxc5 Qxc5 e4  } e5 8. Bxc5 {Essentially the previous bishop move was a waste of tempo for me plus 4th move of the bishop} Qxc5 9. e4 {I felt this was probably my best move now expecting dxe4 fxe4 Nxe4 Nxe4 threatening the queen} d4 {Hmmmfff.. forcing me to move my knight again with options at Na4 Nb1 Ne2, I discounted Nd5 Na4 threatens the queen but was countered with Qb4+ Nb1 seemed to be a backwards move with no real benefit  Interestingly the post game analysis didnt identify inacuracies or blunders from move 3 to move 17 alsthough the score was -2.25 for elyhim  PGA advice on move 3 was Best: -0.38 » 3. e4 Nc6 4. Nh3 Bb4+ 5. c3 Be7 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Be3 d6 8. O-O e5 9. Na3 Bxh3 10. gxh3 Qd7} 10. Nce2 O-O {Getting the king to safety before an attack} 11. c3 dxc3 12. Nxc3 {At this point I felt like I had created some more space but looking at the position I still had an undeveloped bishop and knight on the queenside with all my moves being defensive, I am expecting him to bring his queenside pieces into play soon} Nc6 {Looking at the position now it appears a very strong move for black as he asserts more control on the centre with this move, protecting the pawn on e5 and putting pressure on the d4 square} 13. Qd2 {In hindsight this almost seems a wasted move, although the material is even I am clearly on the back foot in this position, perhaps Bd6 would have been a better move?} Rd8 14. Qf2 {My logic at the time is that the materiel was even here and to trade queens would relieve some of the pressure, downside is castling would be out of the question if he traded } Qa5 {I was suprised to see this move and was trying to figure out what he was going to do next, perhaps Nb4 or b5?} 15. Bc4 {Took the chance to bring out the bishop and prepare to castle if I can get the knight out} Rd4 16. Bb3 {OOther thoughts at the time were b3 to protect the bishop but didn't play that as it would allow Qxc3} Nb4 {Threatening Nd3 forking the queen, I was reluctant to move the king as I still felt castling was an option} 17. Rd1 {I really felt like this was my best option at the time as it defended the d3 square and still didn't move the king  PGA gave the following about my innacuracy: Inaccuracy: -3.00 » 17. Rd1 Nd3+ 18. Rxd3 Rxd3 19. Nge2 Bd7 20. O-O Rd2 21. Rb1 Bc6 22. Qe3 Qb6 23. Qxb6 axb6 24. Bc4 Rc8 Best: -2.23 » 17. Kf1 b6 18. Qe3 Ba6+ 19. Nge2 Rad8 20. Kf2 Bxe2 21. Nxe2 Rd2 22. Rad1 Nd3+ 23. Kg3 Nxb2 24. Rxd2 Rxd2} Rxd1+ {considering the previous comment, I was interested to see that elyhim didn't play the Nd3 Rxd3 Rxd3 option?} 18. Kxd1 {Forcing the king back into the firing line..} Be6 19. Ba4 Rd8+ 20. Ke2 Bc4+ 21. Ke1 Nd3+ {Overall I felt a very weak game by me, I don't think I have played the paleface attack before and certainly am not comfortable with the positions that I got myself into. I think if I had played differently at move 3 the game could have been a stronger one by me, well played elyhim}
