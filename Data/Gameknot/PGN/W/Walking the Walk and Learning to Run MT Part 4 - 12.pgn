1. e4 e5 2. d4 Bd6 3. Nf3 f6 {? This move opens the diagonal.} 4. Bc4 Bb4+ {mistake} 5. c3 Ba5 6. b4 {This is somtimes conidered as a bad move but, as I planned to castle short, I thought it wasn't too dangerous.} Bb6 7. Qb3 {menacing the knight an the king} d6 8. Bxg8 d5 9. Bxd5 {White has already a far better game : direct menace on the king, stronger in the center, material advantage.} Rf8 10. Ba3 {Menacing the tower by b5} c6 11. Bg8 Nd7 {developping. White's plan is to attack c3} 12. Qe6+ Qe7 13. Qxe7+ Kxe7 {The exchange favorise the one who has a material advantage} 14. Bb3 exd4 15. cxd4 {This reinforces white's center} Rd8 {The attack on d4 seems to be a good idea but it is too slow.} 16. O-O {White castle to bring the tower on d1} Nf8 17. Rd1 {now, the attack d5 can begin} Be6 {Black develops but d5 is not protected enough} 18. d5 cxd5 19. exd5 {Now, the bishop will have to remove and the e file will be free} Bf5 20. Re1+ {because of the two bishops on a and b files, black has little good squares for his king.} Kd6 21. b5+ {Now, white judges that it's time for this move.} Bc5 22. Bxc5+ Kxc5 23. Rc1+ {I hoped, black would be tempted to take on b5 so that his king is trapped on ths side} Kxb5 24. Nc3+ Kb6 25. Nd4 g6 {useless move. It would have been better to bring the a rook on c file} 26. Na4+ Ka5 27. Rc5+ Kb4 28. a3# {}
