1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Bf4 Nf6 4. e3 Bf5 5. h3 g6 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. Bxc6 Bxc6 8. Nf3 Bg7 9. Ne5 O-O 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. O-O Re8 12. Be5 e6 13. Na4 h5 {Pawn thrust h6. The center is closed so what do you do? Counter a closed center by attacking the wings.} 14. Nc5 Nd7 15. Bxg7 Kxg7 16. b4 Nxc5 17. bxc5 {The center has closed more making a wing attack even more likely. Which wing to attack? } e5 18. c3 e4 {This seals off the center and opens several diagonals and oppurtunities for black.} 19. a4 {A4, pawn thrust with the hopes to make black counter on the queenside and stay away from the kingside. } Rf8 {Rf8 sets up the f pawn to push forwards to open lines against whites king. } 20. f3 f5 21. f4 {The center is now entirely sealed off. Blacks king does not  need a solid defense because the center is sealed and white would have much problems attacking. } Rb8 {Rb8, white should have taken advantage of this open file sooner. The f file under control by black has opened up a mating possibility for black. } 22. g4 {A weak pawn thrust in an attempt to counter by white. This move takes away the white king's defense and leaves the white king wide open. Compare the white king to the black king, which do you think is better protected now? } hxg4 23. hxg4 {The white king no longer has any defense. } Qh4 24. Rf2 Rfh8 {Mate in 5.} 25. Rg2 Qh1+ 26. Kf2 Rb2+ {The ever so important f file that was controlled by the black rook which could have been controlled by the white rook, has now helped to finish white. } 27. Qe2 Rxe2+ {The rook capture is to draw the king away from the rook on g2. } 28. Kxe2 Qxg2+ {Notice how the king can not move upwards because of the closed center and the aggressive positioning of the black pawns. } 29. Kd1 Rh1# {}
