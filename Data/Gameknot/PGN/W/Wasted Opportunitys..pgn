[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {The Reti opening may not be the most brilliant opening of all but it is a great surprise opening.} c5 2. g3 Nc6 3. Bg2 e6 {I believe d4 is the more aggressive line leading to the Kings Indian Attack which many GM's have scored impressive victorys with.} 4. O-O d5 {I opted to choose a more aggressive line. He could've played c4 to emphasise the h1-a8 diagonal.} 5. d3 Bd6 6. c3 {6.c3 made me wonder. I didn't know what his plan was.} Nf6 7. Nbd2 Bd7 8. b3 Qc7 9. Bb2 {He's blocking his own diagonal. Perhaps c5 is strong here? } h6 {Trying to prevent any annoying moves and making an escape route for my king in the future.} 10. Qc2 a6 {Wanting to gain more space on the queenside with b5 but...} 11. e4 {He strikes the centre. He also has future plans of a e5 fork but just not yet.} Rb8 12. Rae1 O-O {Is c4 strong here? It prepares for a fork and strikes the centre thus being the most logical move. ( Correct me if i'm wrong)} 13. a3 {Weird move. What's the purpose.} Rfe8 14. d4 cxd4 15. Nxd4 e5 16. Nxc6 Bxc6 17. a4 dxe4 18. Bxe4 Nxe4 19. Nxe4 {Now his fianchettoed bishop is gone.} Be7 20. c4 Bd7 {A few inaccurate time wasting moves which allow him to gain the upperhand.} 21. Qc3 Bh3 {I will be up the exchange but lose my bishop pair.} 22. f4 {Taking on f4 will be GG} Bxf1 23. Rxf1 f6 24. Kh1 exf4 25. Rxf4 Ref8 26. Rf5 Qc6 27. Qe3 Rbe8 28. Rh5 {White does have some compensation for being down the exchange but i think i can still hold on.} Bc5 29. Rxc5 Qxe4+ 30. Qxe4 Rxe4 31. Ba3 {Forces the exchange of queens. Now being up the exchange should be easy.} Rd8 {More accurate and crushing is 31.Ba3 Re2 32. RESIGNS! } 32. Kg2 {I fail so much....} Rd2+ 33. Kh3 Re3 {Huge blunder. It was too late when i pressed the button.} 34. Rc8+ Kh7 35. Bc1 Rdd3 36. Bxe3 Rxe3 37. b4 Rb3 38. b5 Rb4 39. bxa6 bxa6 40. a5 Ra4 41. Rc5 Rb4 42. Rc6 Ra4 43. Rc5 Ra2 44. Rd5 Kg8 45. Kh4 Rxh2+ 46. Kg4 Rc2 47. c5 Kf7 48. Kf5 g6+ 49. Ke4 f5+ 50. Ke5 Ke7 51. Kf4 Rc4+ 52. Ke3 Ke6 53. Rd6+ Ke7 54. Rxg6 Rxc5 55. Rxa6 h5 56. Kf4 Kd7 57. Rf6 Rxa5 58. Rxf5 Ra4+ 59. Kf3 h4 60. g4 Ra3+ 61. Kf4 Ra4+ 62. Kf3 Ra3+ 63. Kg2 Rg3+ 64. Kh2 Rxg4 65. Rf7+ Ke6 66. Rh7 Kf5 67. Kh3 {If 67. Kh3 .. Kg5 then 68. Rg7+ winning the rook and i will be hopelessly lost.} Rg1 {So i just make a random move and offer draw which he accepts. I missed so many opportunity's making this game somewhat interesting.}
