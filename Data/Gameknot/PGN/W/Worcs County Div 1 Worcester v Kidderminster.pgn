1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {Vienna Opening (a personal favourite)} 4. d3 Na5 {Threatening to capture on c4} 5. Nge2 {allowing the capture as recommended on the DVD I have by IM Andrew Martin.  White would then get control of d5 and maybe play for 0-0, Ng3, Nd5...} Bb4 6. Bb3 {maybe 0-0 was best here} Nxb3 7. axb3 O-O 8. O-O {We both Castle} Bxc3 9. Nxc3 {thought about bxc3 but then he plays d5 so decided to play Nxc3 instead} d6 10. f4 Bg4 11. Qe1 {didn't mind Bg4 as Queen usually head to e1 and eventually g3} exf4 {otherwise I may have played f5} 12. Bxf4 Nh5 {again going for this manoeuvre} 13. Be3 {I want to keep the Bishop for now, and this leaves his Knight mis-placed and returning to f6 is risky for him after Bg5} a6 14. Nd5 c6 {attacking my Knight...} 15. Bb6 {but I had in mind retreating the Knight to e3 where it may then get to the f5 square, so first I attacked his Queen.} Qg5 {I think this is a mistake, as it seems that I can force the Knight for Rook exchange from here? perhaps Qd7 was okay?} 16. h4 Qh6 17. Be3 Qe6 {He can't play Qg6 as Ne7+ would win..} 18. Nc7 Qe5 19. Nxa8 Rxa8 {Exchange up but maybe at the expense of some weaknesses on my Kingside?} 20. Qf2 {putting pressure on f7} f6 {and now the Knight is stuck on the edge of the board...} 21. Bd4 Qe6 22. Rae1 {I had thought about Ra5 but after c5 my Rook will take longer to rejoin the action... so I had the plan of e5!} Rc8 23. c4 {Perhaps I should have played b4 but after c4 I was hoping for Bc3, d4, d5} c5 24. Bc3 b5 {he obviously is intending b4, so I thought my e1 Rook would be more effective if......} 25. e5 {I give up the e Pawn...} dxe5 {as I think it is okay for me to retake anyway...} 26. Bxe5 {if now fxe5 then Rxe5! where Qxe5 leads to mate and Qd7 could be met with Rxc5 leaving Black with Queenside Pawn majority.} h6 {So he decided not to take the offered Bishop..... which may be worse?} 27. Bc3 {time to retreat and uncover the attack on his Queen..} Qd6 {Threatening to win back the exchange with Ng3 and also attacking d3 pawn.} 28. Re3 {Defending both..g3 & d3  (not sure if Re4 was better)?} b4 29. Bd2 Kh7 {I thought this was a mistake.....} 30. Re4 {Attacking his Bishop} f5 {defends it with the Pawn..... as I had hoped.... Can you see why?} 31. Rxg4 fxg4 {so I give up the exchange.... but after my next move..} 32. Qf5+ {winning back a Rook so effectively leaving me a Rook up...... ... so he decided to resign...   he said he was thinking of Qg6 but after Qxc8, White is clearly winning.  If g6, then 33. Qxc8  Qd4+,  34. Kh2 where g3+ is no use after Kh3 and Qe5+ can be met with Bf4, (if Nxf4 then Qxg4)... just tried this line against Shredder and went on to win all the Queenside pawns...  Thanks for looking.}
