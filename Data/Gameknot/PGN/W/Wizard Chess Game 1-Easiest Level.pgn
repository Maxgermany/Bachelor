[Opening "Dunst (Sleipner, Heinrichsen) opening (A00)"]

1. Nc3 {I was quite surprised to see the Dunst Opening.} Nf6 {But, it did develop right away, so I decided to develop also.  But, I use the other N as I'm focused on the K side.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {I forget the name but think it's called the Four N's Defense.} 3. e3 {I had expected 3.e4 here, but my response.} e5 4. a4 {Opening up a file for the Ra1.  But, 4.a3 appeared more logical because of what I'm about to do next.} Bb4 {The idea is trying to put pressure on the opponent, but it doesn't bother the computer as it'll do the same with my Nc6.} 5. Bb5 Na5 {? My plan was to fork with ...Nb3 when the moment was right which, luckily occurs.  This, however, is a mistake.  But, it's more then just having it on the rim, this is a mistake because of what white will play next.} 6. Nxe5 Qe7 {Meanwhile, I treat like a different variation which would work if white's e pawn wasn't there.  As I'm trying to figure out a way to get something back which isn't very useful, yet.} 7. Bxd7+ {? But, this is an oversight that will allow me to do that.  As I defended more then the computer attacked.} Bxd7 8. Nxd7 Qxd7 9. Nb5 {I don't see the point behind this move which is why I attack with 9...a6.} a6 10. Nd6+ {?? But, this is even worse as I'll get a piece.  Since it's easy, I think the computer is intentionally making these blunder so that it'll be easier for me.  It's also important to note that a couple of days after this game, being without cable, I played another game.  That was at the hardest level with white, where I lost.  And, that'll be the next game that I annotate.} Bxd6 11. Qf3 {I also don't see the point to this move since white's bringing out the Q before continuing with it's development for no good reason.  But, I think it's the same thing, and with that, I decide to attack c3 on my next move.  As 11...Qc6 is a dual purpose move since I'm also threatening to liquidate Q's, as well.} Qc6 12. c3 {This is the wise choice, but with it, I'm also, extremely happy to exchange here since I'm, of course, up.  But, it's more then just that, as I kept in mind that white's K side pawn structure will be ruined which I remembered from a lesson in Chess Polgar University.} Qxf3 13. gxf3 Nb3 {As noted, this was my plan behind 5...Na5.  But, it's in a better context now because protecting Ra1 means further liquidation.} 14. Ke2 {?? Of course, the computer enjoys making it easy due to the level, and with it, I happily take on a1.} Nxa1 15. e4 {Planning to fork, but I look through it, see what's there, and ask if that would work.  I then realize that it wouldn't, so, 16.e5? would, of course, add insult to injury.  With that, I decide that now is the time to castle short.} O-O 16. d4 {Not seeing the point to this, I decide to force further liquidation with 16...Nb3.} Nb3 17. Kd1 Nxc1 18. Kxc1 Nh5 {My plan here was to play 19...Nf4 here with the idea of 20...Ne2+, and from there, I'd then try to figure out what else I could do.  And, the computers next move allows me to bring the N to f4, but since white's next move stops the check, I refrain from responding with 20...Ne2.} 19. Kb1 Nf4 {So, it's a waiting thing, but after white's next move, I make a quick decision on how to respond.} 20. c4 c5 {As I threaten to exchange, as I have f2 in mind.  The idea is, winning another pawn.} 21. Rg1 {But, this move allows me to do it right away, since I'm about to take on d4.} cxd4 22. Rd1 {Trying to stop that pawn.} d3 {But, I had other ideas since passed pawns must be pushed.  And, I kept in mind that it's now protected by my Nf4.} 23. Rd2 {Still trying to block.} Bb4 {So, I attack.} 24. Rd1 Bc5 {And, with it, I target f2, and when the computer protects with 25.Rd2, I defend d3 again with my Ra8, as I'll also have the opportunity to centralize my Rf8 later on.} 25. Rd2 Rad8 26. e5 {Trying to push a different pawn, but I'll respond to this by attacking f2 a second time, with my Nf4.} Nh3 27. b3 {I don't see the point behind this move, but either way, white doesn't have any good moves left.  And, I emphasize that on my next move, when I take on f2, as I'm asking white what it's going to do then.} Nxf2 28. h4 {One thing is certain, white's doing what it can for counterplay, but I'm about to show that it's of no use since I'll attack Rd2 with 28...Be3.  My thought process is that if it protects it's Rd2, I'll respond with 28...d2 and promote since the R's behind it.  At the very least, white's R will still be gone since, as with the team game that others saw.  And, it's for the same reason that  Jack showed me something similar since it'll be directly pinned to the K because I won't underpromote.} Be3 29. Ka2 {But, doing this makes things even easier since I'll just take it, at once.  I'm sure that a person would resign after my next move, but the computer continues until you mate.  Similar to chess puzzles, they want to see if someone like me will find the mate for learning purposes.} Bxd2 30. c5 {Still trying for counterplay.} Be3 {I wouldn't have worked anyway, but I'm basically telling the computer that I won't have any nonsense with this move.} 31. c6 bxc6 {And, with it, I take.} 32. e6 {Trying to find a way to promote, which I can allow because even if I straight played 32...d2 with the idea of 33.e7 d1=Q 34.PXR=Q RXP I'm still far ahead with a Q on deck.  But, I decided that allowing is just letting white do nonsense, and I'll still none of that.  So, I decide to take on e6 first, before promoting.  } fxe6 33. Kb2 {I also kept in mind that it would possible to use just what I have which I normally do.  But, in this case, I realize that Queening would guarantee a quick checkmate for me.  As I'm still thinking about the Double Bishop and N+B endgame checkmates with the line of symmetry which I also used for Precalculous.} d2 34. Ka2 {In addition, keeping in mind where my N is, combined with, what happened against anitam, where I went wrong, I'd still promote, even if white were to play 34.Kc2} d1=Q 35. a5 {I had anticipated 35.Ka3 which would've been slightly.  And, I would've answered with 35...Rd2 as I thought that this forces a mate.  If so, it would not have been that soon which I thought, but I would've, sooner or later, found a mate.  As there's no way that I was going to let white pull a swindle with a stalemate.  But, this allows me to mate even sooner.} Qc2+ 36. Ka3 Rd3 37. Ka4 Qxb3# {}
