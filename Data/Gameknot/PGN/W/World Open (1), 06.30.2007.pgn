1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 a6 {Not the most popular move in this position, but a very interesting one. Black wanted to surprise his opponent.} 4. Ngf3 c5 5. exd5 exd5 6. Bd3 {?! This move loses a tempo; here Black realized that his opponent probably isn't very familiar with this variation. The most natural move here is 6. Be2.} c4 7. Be2 Nc6 8. b3 b5 9. a4 Bf5 10. axb5 axb5 11. Rxa8 Qxa8 12. bxc4 bxc4 13. O-O Be7 {Here Blacks opponent spent a lot of time and came up with  this very interesting piece sacrifice.} 14. Nxc4 {!? Normal play would be 14. c3 Nf6 15.Nh4 Be6 16. Qc2 Qc8 17. Re1 0-0 18. Nf1 with roughly equal chances.} dxc4 15. Bxc4 Kf8 {A very difficult move to find. Black realized he will not have time to castle, making his king vulnerable in the center in an open position. For example, 15. ... Nf6 16. d5 Na5 17. Bb5  Bd7 18. Bxd7  Nxd7 19. Rel and White has a strong attack while Black's king is still mired in the center.} 16. Bf4 Qc8 17. d5 Na5 18. Bd3 Nf6 19. d6 Bd8 20. Re1 Nc6 21. Bc4 h6 {Here , black felt comfortable about his position because his pieces are working together and are all well defended. But he still needs to bring his h8-rook into the game.} 22. h4 {The idea behind this move is to stop ... g7-g5. However, black thinks this move is too slow; better is 22. Bb5 with the idea of c2-c5 and the position remains unclear.} Kg8 23. Ng5 {Here white, in time pressure, attempts to complicate the position with a second piece sacrifice, but unfortunately for him black has a defense.} hxg5 24. hxg5 Ne4 {If 24. ...Be4? 25. d7! (25. gxf6?? Rh1 ! 26. Kxh1 Qh3  27. Bh2 Qxg2 mate.) ...Qxd7 26. Qxd7 Nxd7 27. Rxe4 and white is "back in the game."} 25. Qd5 {Better was 25. d7 Qxd7 26. Qxd7 Bxd7 27. Rxe4 Bf5 28. Re8  Kh7 29. Rxh8  Kxh8 30. Bxf7 Bxc2 white has some drawing chances.} Qe6 {Now black is winning.} 26. Qxc6 Rh1+ {! Black saw this strong idea before capturing the knight on g5.} 27. Kxh1 Nxf2+ 28. Kh2 Ng4+ {It is stronger to play this intermezzo before capturing on e1 in order to force the white king to the uncomfortable h3- square.} 29. Kh3 Qxe1 30. Qa8 Ne5+ 31. Kh2 Qh4+ 32. Kg1 Qxf4 33. Qxd8+ Kh7 34. d7 Qd4+ 35. Kh1 Qxd7 36. g6+ Kxg6 37. Qb6+ f6 38. Be2 Qd2 39. Qf2 Qxc2 {White resigns.}
