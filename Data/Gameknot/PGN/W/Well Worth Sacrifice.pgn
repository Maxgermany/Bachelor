1. c4 {When playing as White, I never play English Opening because White is less active than it could be. So far, I have had some pretty good winning chances playing against White's English Opening.} e5 2. d3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Be7 4. Nf3 d6 5. g3 c6 6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O Bg4 8. Qb3 Qc7 9. Be3 Nbd7 10. Rfe1 {Incorrect. The e-pawn is still at the base position, and the dark-squared bishop completely buries the pawn, making Rfe1 a bad move.} Bh5 {I don't like the dark-squared bishop eyeing on the a7-g1 diagonal because I want to place my knight on c5, which chases the queen away, and allows easy access to the active e6 square.} 11. Rad1 Ng4 {Removing the bishop, or forcing it to occupy a more passive square.} 12. a3 {Totally disregarding my plan.} Nxe3 {Happily trading it. Now, white's e2 is seriously buried, and Re1 looks like a joke! } 13. fxe3 {Look closely, the e3 pawn cannot be defended, and if it is moved to e4, it would block Ne4, and the fianchettoed bishop's access to the long diagonal.} Nc5 {Appears to be kicking the queen away, but all I wanted to do was to maneuver the knight. Doing it without losing a tempo!} 14. Qc2 Bg6 {Stopping white's idea of advancing d4, which would force me to trade pawns to dissolve his double pawns. Of course, I want to maintain my spatial advantage.} 15. Qc1 {Moving his queen away to prepare d4.} Ne6 {By moving the knight to this active square, I avoid trading central pawns, which would be ideal for him to alleviate some spatial cramps. } 16. d4 {No longer a good move because my knight is not on c5.} e4 {Now, white's double pawns and rook on the e-file are non-existent.} 17. Nd2 f5 {The only good way to protect the advanced pawn.} 18. d5 {Again, it is not necessary to push the pawn because it now gives my knight a new (and better) active square to maneuver to. Nc5-d7-e5 is unstoppable!} Nc5 19. Ref1 {Finally realizing the passivity of that rook. A better move would have been g4 to immediately undermine my e4-f5 pawns. Perhaps, he is concerned about giving his king too much air. } Bg5 {Claiming the weak e3 pawn and anchoring the bishop at the enemy's camp! This pawn cannot be defended, and the bishop is annoying the queen. } 20. Ndb1 {Only to prolong the inevitable.} Nb3 21. Qc2 Bxe3+ {Winning a tempo, and the bishop has found its outpost!} 22. Kh1 Nc5 {I thought about playing Nd4 to annoy the queen but the queen can escape to Qa4, and my knight would not have a good position to anchor to. Also, the prospect of him trading his rook for my knight would do him more good since my knight is very strong.} 23. b4 Nd7 {Gladly retreating to facilitate the maneuver. White's queenside expansion will not help, as black's queenside is looking quite robust.} 24. Nd2 {Making its way to b3 for more active squares} Ne5 {As stated earlier, this is the new outpost for the knight.} 25. Nb3 {Looking to occupy d4 or a5. But more importantly, he can now push c5 to challenge my queenside. If 26. c5 dxc5, 27. d6 forces my queen to retreat and will thus give white more central space.} Rad8 {Nxc4? I want to avoid complications like 26. Nxe4 (discovery attack on my knight), which would then free his light-squared bishop and undermine my dark-squared bishop's outpost.  Rd8 stops the possibility of 26. c5 dxc5 because 27. d6 is now met with Rxd6.} 26. dxc6 bxc6 {Qxc6 would have been a blunder, since it allows Nb5 or Nd5, with the latter being much stronger., which forces my dark-squared bishop to give up the a7-g1 diagonal.} 27. Na4 {Possibly noticing that the pawn is undefended, but hey, I am not interested anyway.} Rf6 {Seizing the initiative to launch kingside attack, while protecting the d-pawn so that my rook at d8 can move around.} 28. c5 d5 {Rejecting and now creating a new spot for my knight. Nc4.} 29. Nb2 {Stopping Nc4.} Ng4 {I could threaten perpetual (or win material), but I basically want to bring the rook, knight, and bishop together for an attack.} 30. Rdb1 {Avoiding the fork. But to be completely honest, I wouldn't take it because my knight is far more superior.} Bf7 {Slowly giving up the defense on f5 pawn to prepare Rh6.} 31. Nd1 {With this move, my bishop can no longer control the a7-g1 diagonal, and it can only retreat to g5 to still allow the rook to access h6. Black would be giving up some spatial advantage. Though Nd1 looks to be a passive move, my opponent (a 2000+ rated player, mind you) is slowly neutralizing my attack.  If you were me, how would you keep the initiative going?} Qxg3 {How about a queen sacrifice to force mate!} 32. hxg3 {Forced. Note that my queen wouldn't have been so powerful had it not been for the well-positioned bishop that controls the a7-g1 diagonal.} Rh6+ {A much more effective way to bring the rook to h6 without losing a tempo!} 33. Bh3 {Again, much thanks my well-positioned dark-squared bishop, even though it is just a step away from being captured!} Rxh3+ {The fianchetto bishop has really been a burden to him, but now, everything is just too late.} 34. Kg2 Rh2# {A beautiful combination of rook, knight, and bishop courtesy of the queen sacrifice!}
