[Opening "Sicilian (B23), Grand Prix attack, Schofman variation"]

1. e4 c5 {A team match in which I am playing black. White played the King's pawn, so I opted for the Sicilian. I must say, I'm pretty proud of this one. My oppnent gave me fits and kept me in a straight jacket for almost 20 moves. This is by far the hardest defensive struggle I have undergone in any of my recent chess games.} 2. Nc3 Nc6 {White chose the "Close Variation", often considered positional rather than sharp, and I followed with the main line.} 3. f4 g6 {White's 3. f4 begins the Grand Prix Attack, and I play a dragonish response to fianchetto the king's bishop aiming at d4 and irritating white's center.} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. e5 d6 {White left the main line (5. Bb5 in my book) and left me stranded, so off to opening principles. I figure white blocked my fianchettoed bishop, so I'll attack his advanced center and eliminate the blocker.} 6. Bb5 Bd7 {White got back to the main line, but with a difference being the threat of exchanges in the center.} 7. O-O dxe5 {White didn't defend his fragile center, so it's time to win a pawn.} 8. fxe5 Nxe5 9. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {Now black is a pawn up, though otherwise development seems roughly equal. Black has more mobility for his pieces, so perhaps a slight advantage here (beyond the material one).} 10. d3 e6 11. Ne4 Nc6 {Opens the diagonal for my bishop. The black pawn at c5 seems undefended, but it is really just bait for a little trap.} 12. Nxc5 Bd4+ {Black took the bait, and now he must lose a knight.} 13. Nxd4 Qxd4+ 14. Kh1 Qxc5 {Black has extended his material advantage, and has a lead in development as well. Things seem to be going well for black.} 15. Qf3 Qe7 {White's move threatened the backward f7 pawn. I defended it with my queen. I looked long and hard at playing 15. ... f5 instead, but decided against primarily because it leaves the pawn at e6 backward and vulnerable on a half-open file. Given how things turned out in this game, I think faced with this move in the future, I would choose advancing the pawn over defending with the queen. As played, I am putting myself into a straight jacket of my own choosing, and will spend many moves laboriously struggling to get out of it.} 16. Bg5 Qc7 {My poor royal lady is being chased by a mere bishop. How demeaning...} 17. Rae1 h6 {White has brought 4 pieces to bear on the black king who is trapped in the center. While he is well defended, the ferocity of white's attack cannot be ignored. Black must play carefully here. Note that his king's knight is trapped with no moves (Ne7? results in Qxf7) and while that knight is trapped, there is no hope for the black rook on h8 to get involved either. The black rook on a8 has room to play, but little role in the defense at this time. Essentially, black's pieces and pawns are all in each others' way, and he is defending against a four-piece attack with only two pieces.} 18. Bf4 Qd7 {Again my queen is harassed. She cannot leave the 7th rank or the f7 pawn will fall (white's bishop blocks the attack, so the queen has more options right now, but a single move by the bishop, such as Bxh6, and white is back in business on the f7 pawn). The straight jacket is so uncomfortable!} 19. Bg3 Nd4 {Aha! I find a little, and mostly ineffective attack of my own. But at least it's something, a little wiggle room in the straight jacket.} 20. Qf2 Nf5 {Blocking the white attack on f7 and threatening the bishop.} 21. Be5 f6 {Saving the rook and chasing away the bishop. Maybe a tiny bit more wiggle room now, but not much - I'm still firmly tied in knots.} 22. Bc3 h5 {Black is still tied up in knots. His knight on g8 cannot move or he loses the pawn on f6. The h8 rook is still mostly trapped out of the way, though he has a little room to move - just not much reason to move. The black queen is still tied to defense, now she protects the pawn at e6. One false step and the whole thing crumbles. This move prevents white from easily playing a pawn to g4.} 23. Qe2 e5 {Advancing the pawn lets his brother on f6 defend him, and at the same times takes some of the pressure off of the f6 pawn.} 24. Red1 O-O-O {White seemed to be setting up 25. d4. Castling brings my distant rook into the picture, unpins the e5 pawn, and gets the king out of immediate harms' way - all good. And now with 4 threats on d4, white's d-pawn is going nowhere. I have been in this straight jacket for 9 moves now, and this is the first time I can feel it noticeably loosening up.} 25. Rf3 Nd4 {White plans to double rooks on the f-file, but his move lets me trade off his bishop by forking him - he must capture the knight.} 26. Bxd4 Qxd4 {Whew, one enemy piece eliminated. My straight jacket feels a little less restrictive. I have an arm free, but the jacket is still on.} 27. c3 Qb6 {Frees the knight from his tiresome defense of f6.} 28. h3 Ne7 {Another hand free!} 29. Re1 Nf5 {In retrospect, I'm glad white didn't play 29. d4 while my e5 pawn was pinned (29. ... exd4, 30. Qxe7 costs black his knight). So I move the knight to unpin the e5 pawn and put pressure on d4, and at the same time blocking white's rook's attack on the f6 pawn, freeing my queen from that defensive duty. I feel another buckle on the straight jacket come undone, and I'm just about free of it.} 30. Kh2 Qd6 {I am not sure what 30. kh2 did for white, other than keeping the black knight from the royal fork on g3. For now, the white rook on f3 has that covered, and that rook doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon, so maybe white was just playing a waiting move and covering his bases. My move threatens 31. ... e4  to win the white rook on f3.} 31. Kg1 Qa6 {Forking two pawns, though the pawn on d3 is well enough defended. I am thinking of doubling rooks on the half-open d-file and putting white into his own straight jacket. Maybe see how he feels about it for a change.} 32. a3 Rd6 {Plan in motion.} 33. Qe4 Qb6+ {Ahh, finally I shrug off the last of my straight jacket. White has no useful attacks and my pieces are no longer all tied to critical defenses. So now I launch a campaign of my own. White's queen was tied to the defense of the pawn on b2, but he moved her away. Time to pounce! After 18 moves in that straight jacket, I'm ready to leap at anything that feels like an attack!} 34. Kh2 Qxb2 {Gobble. But now white has an excellent response that I did not anticipate.} 35. d4 Qxa3 {Uh oh, white is threatening my pawn at e5 (36. Pxe5 Pxe5? 37. Qxe5 and white gains a pawn, forks both rooks, and forces black to get back on defense). But worse, he's threatening 36. Rb1!, skewering the black queen against the b7 pawn. After 36. ... Qxa3, 37. Qxb7  Kmoves, 38. Qb8  Kmoves, 39. Qxh8 and now white is right back in the game, material is even, and black's kingside is going to crumble as the white queen attacks it from the rear. I search around for the move that prevents both eventualities, but there is none. So I take the a3 pawn, extending my material lead to a knight and 2 pawns, knowing I will lose a pawn in the center and have to run back on defense.} 36. Ra1 Qxa1 {I don't know how this happened. My guess is, white knew how strong Rb1 could have been, and he realized that Ra1 could chase my queen to the b-file and allow him to play that devastating Rb1. In fact, when I returned to this board and saw his rook on a1 threatening me, I panicked a little, thinking I would have to do just that, flee to the scary b-file. Until I realized that the rook on a1 had no defender - the one flaw in white's plan. So I gobble him up and white takes the noble way out, resigning to spare the rest of his pieces from violent ends on the field of battle. I spent 18 moves in this 36-move game in that confounded straight jacket. Half the game. Lesson learned: the queen is not a defender.}
