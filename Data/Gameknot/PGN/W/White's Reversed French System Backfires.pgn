1. e3 {An uncommon opening, that gives Black at least equality.} e5 2. d4 e4 3. c4 {Discouraging ... d5, which can still be played: 3. ... d5 4. cxd5 Qxd5 5. Nc3 Bb4} Nf6 {This move looks best.} 4. Nc3 Bb4 {This is an improved version of the Nimzo-Indian, because the e4 pawn prevents both Bd3 and Nf3.} 5. f3 {White should play Nge2 followed by a kingside fianchetto or Ng3, Be2, and 0-0.} Bxc3+ {Doubling White's c-pawns} 6. bxc3 O-O 7. fxe4 Nxe4 8. Nf3 {Preventing ... Qh4 Nxc3 isn't a threat because Qc2 traps the knight.} Re8 9. Qc2 d6 10. Bd3 Bf5 11. O-O Bg6 12. Kh1 {The King was better on g1.} Nd7 13. Ba3 {The bishop does nothing on a3.} Nb6 {Threatening ... Nxc4 followed by ... Ng3+, winning the Queen} 14. Rae1 {White doesn't see the danger.} Nxc4 15. Bc1 {All other moves lose.} Qe7 {... d5 was best.} 16. a4 h5 {Provoking h4, which loses to ... Ng3+} 17. Nd2 Nxe3 {The most forcing continuation, since the Queen is under attack.} 18. Rxe3 Nf2+ 19. Rxf2 Qxe3 {Forking Rook and Bishop} 20. Bxg6 {Completely losing} Qxf2 21. Bh7+ Kh8 22. Bd3 Re1+ {Mate is unstoppable.}
