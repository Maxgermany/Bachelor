1. e4 {The name of the tournament  was of course not "Who is zooming whom??". Being that it has no relative bearing here at Gameknot, I took the editors discretion and called this game      a representation of the theme which the game overall expressed!!} c5 {A mild attempt at the Sicilian Defence.....} 2. c4 {Not familiar with this response, though have seen it before. Is this standard?} Nc6 {Just seemed the right thing to do, if your opponent does not want or exibits that development is not an issue, well then, just get ahead of him or her and enjoy the extra tempo you gain!} 3. Nf3 {His lead in development is by one pawn?} d6 {I hope recommendations for this opening are given by someone who studies them.... as well you can see, I do not, and need the advisers care!} 4. d4 {Commanding pawn formation in the center.} Bg4 {I REALLY HARDLY EVER use pins so early..... they never stay pinned and throw a good piece to the boards edge.} 5. d5 {4 out of 5 moves for white have been pawn.......Must absolutely have abolished the book by now!} Ne5 {Seemed natural.} 6. Be2 {In kind!} Nxf3+ {Some of what I have gained from players insights and being a student of the game, is that Black has a mission in exchanging more often than not. By doing so gains equality with the tempo White is blessed with initially is the theory..... Masters, this is your invitation to shed some light please??!!} 7. Bxf3 Bd7 {Then again, can anyone see my reasoning for not exchanging the BISHOPS? Because I'm clueless too!} 8. O-O {Now cramped and looking behind in space for any kind of plan formulation.... I applaud the opponent!} g6 {Maybe acquiring a1-h8 dominance for my Bishop?} 9. Re1 {Seems the Queen side can wait to develop? Kinda matches my King side egh?} Bg7 {OK!} 10. Qb3 {Still searching for a mentor!!!!!! I am!!!!!!!} b6 {If I have white square weakness, then it is justification for 7. ..... Bd7! I think jstevens would be proud of my Billblock!!!!} 11. Bf4 {Wish we had a plan!} f6 {I played this during a very temporary bout with insanity! I would recommend no one annotating the specific benifits of a move like this, simply due to it may confirm your own temp/perm insanity!} 12. Nc3 {I think I match up well with this guy.......fully developed, he is, and I met all his pawn moves!!!!! And even an extra one!!!!!!!!!!} Nh6 {Have to look like f6 was meant for something...... really, when you look at this position, hard to believe I won. On second glance though, who is better? I might have dubbed this game as the "wait for attacks whole heartily?" This is a job for a super player to step up and guide us through this mass of external ugliness.} 13. h3 {Now we are even on the pawn advancements.....  PERFECT!!!!!!} Nf7 {There, pawn advancement justification!} 14. Qc2 {OK, wondered if she was gonna stay in her closet over there.} O-O {And so the reluctance for attack continues......} 15. Rad1 Ne5 {Anything better than the boring? Hey, I only know that this game does get better with time!} 16. Be2 {We both excel at defence?} Kh8 {I hope I make this move look as though it has some purpose. I thought I would wait it out and see if any aggression will ever be expressed by my opponent!} 17. Qc1 {Looks Bh6-ish for him.... in keeping with that..................} Qe8 {Even more purposeful the f6!!!} 18. Bh6 Qf7 {See? Finally, the attack comes to me!} 19. Bxg7+ Qxg7 {Only thing positive to say so far is that I was the first to give check! My opponent made it even! Is my position improving????} 20. b3 {He is ahead 6-5 in pawn moves!} Rae8 {Is there better?} 21. f4 {Bout died....another attack?!!} Nf7 {Imagine if you will, how disrupted my position would have been without f6? 21. f4 would have won the exchange.} 22. Qe3 e5 {I thought, I've had enough already, let there be light positive or negative to the ending of this game!!! Masters annotations are fully admired and thank you for helping way ahead of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! } 23. Bg4 {Don't know what to say...... believe it or not!!!!!} exf4 {Tempo?} 24. Qxf4 f5 {Discovered attack with tempo? Where should all the ???????? go???????} 25. exf5 Rxe1+ 26. Rxe1 Qxc3 27. Re7 {Wow----now the game is at that point of who is zooming whom? Extreme apologies for the waiting.......} Ne5 28. Qh6 {I felt the zoom was gonna consume me!! This strong move requires investigation!} Qe1+ {BEWARE OF TACTICS....... most of the time they win!!!!} 29. Kh2 Nxg4+ {Royal fork fake with check!, but along with it a discovered attack to the rook from my highness!! Plus delivering the required defence against mate! Pert near the craziest it gets!} 30. hxg4 {FORCED} Qxe7 31. fxg6 Qg7 {The defence with the right spark of aggression wins! Any problems with that??? Black assumes resigning will do! I want to personally thank all of you who were willing to wait and see this, and for those who annotate/comment, may your games be showered in blessings.....thekingni........}
