[Opening "French (C19), Winawer, advance, poisoned pawn variation"]

1. e4 e6 {The French Defence, though conceding more than many other defences, has the virtue of solidity.  } 2. d4 {Building a broad centre.  This move is by far and away the most preferred line.} d5 {The most usual, and what I normally play as well.  But every now and ten I will switch to 2...b6!? - Owen's Defence. Non-committal in the centre, Black intends later to undermine white's central hold.   With this pawn advance, Black is at once challenging for the centre more directly.} 3. Nc3 {Main Line.  Also playable are 3.e5 (Advance Variation) and 3.Nd2 (Tarrasch).  The Advance line intends to cramp Black's game, especially on the K-side.  But Black usually challenges this plan outright, with ...c4 after which a big battle rages around the d4-square: 3.e5 c4  4.Nf3 Nc6  5.c3 Qb6.  The Tarrasch is more restrained, but seeks a K-side attack without allowing the pin by a Bishop at b4.} Bb4 {The Winawer - one of my favorite Chess openings - for both sides.} 4. e5 {White's most usual response, this heralds an intention to attack the K-side.  White could keep Black guessing and play 4.a3 right now, or even 4.Bd2: the 'Finger Slip.'  } c5 {Equally thematic: Black looks to operate on the Q-side.} 5. a3 {Forcing Black to make a decision about what to do with the Bishop.  I rather like the retreat to a5, but have to admit that it is not bringing me very good results against strong opposition.  More usual in any case is the exchange on c3.} Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7 {Apparently preparing to castle.  But it is probably just as well to develop this knight right now, as otherwise 7.Qg4 would induce the g-pawn's advance, leaving the dark squares weak.  It would be playable, but I can't say I like it much.  This might be due to the many times in the past I have been able to exploit the dark square weakness when I've had the white pieces.} 7. Qg4 {Although White could simply develop by 7.Nf3, this Queen sortie is quite popular, and quite good, too.  What should Black do?  He could defend the g-pawn by ...Kf8 or even ...0-0, but I like to let the K-side go.  There are compensations, as you will see.} cxd4 8. Qxg7 {Instead 8...cxd4 was possible.  But here white accepts the challenge and goes for the lucrative raid among Black's K-side pawns.} Rg8 {Taking the open file.} 9. Qxh7 Qc7 {Black's turn: attacking c3 and e5 both.  } 10. Bd2 {Defending c3 and averting the K/R fork by the Queen.  Black could play ...Qxe5 now, but prefers to create an imposing-looking pawn phalanx in the centre.  } dxc3 {Instead 10...Qxe5ch  11.Ne2 and if then 11...dxc3  12.Bxc3.  I much prefer the text.} 11. Bf4 {This might look like a loss of time for white, but in fact he did well to force Black to commit to a line of action.    Black's central majority looks impressive, but the fact is, it's not very easy to get it moving.  White, meanwhile, has a passed h-pawn, and that has to be a consideration for the rest of the game.} Nbc6 {Now that the opening skirmishes have died down, both sides look to completing their development.  This is a good moment to review the position.  Black's position looks the more solid, and his central pawns the more imposing.  He is a little further ahead in development as well.  But White has badly wounded Black's K-side, such that the White passed  h-pawn remains a long-term asset.  Not so far ahead in development, White can be picky about how he mobilizes his K-side.  Altogether, this is a very unclear position, difficult to call.} 12. Nf3 Bd7 13. Ng5 {(?) A mistake, but a very plausible one.  Seeing an opportunity to strike at the f7-square, White goes for it.  The threat is 14.Qxf7ch Kd8  15.Nxe6ch.  In response, I did briefly consider 13...Nxe5, but quickly found Black had a much better reply...  } Rxg5 {(!) This small combination will win material.  } 14. Bxg5 Qxe5+ {Forking King and Bishop.  What can White do about it?} 15. Be3 {Saving the Bishop and keeping the exchange?  No.  Meanwhile White can not gain access to the eighth rank with his Queen, neither..} d4 {This will win the immobilized Bishop, leaving Black ahead, 2 minor pieces for a rook.} 16. f4 {(?) This might not look all that serious, as the Bishop was lost anyway.  Possibly White hoped that by inducing Black's Queen to take it rather than the d-pawn, then Black will have uncovered the h8-square for a Queen check of his own.  But as it happens, this pawn thrust is a fatal error from which Black is able to throw in a decisive attack and bring the White King under a close siege.} Qxe3+ 17. Be2 {Forced, on account of the mate after 17.Kd1.} Ng6 {(!) A vital component of the attack.  White was threatening Qh8ch, which would have won a knight and the rook on a8.  Black averts the worst of that, whilst threatening ...Nxf4 and ...Qxe2#.  Black is not concerned about the loss of his rook after 18.Qg8ch Ke7  19.Qxa8 as after 19...Nxf4 White can not escape the mate.  } 18. Rd1 {Defending against the possibility of ...Qd2ch and ...Qxc2, giving Black an advanced co-joined pair of passed pawns.  Had White played 18.g3 to protect the f-pawn, I might well have gone in for that line, or maybe tried ...Nce7, followed by ...Bb5 and threatening mate that way.  But I was expecting 18.Qh5 here as White's likeliest choice. } Nxf4 {Bringing home the mate threat, and placing White's king under a tight siege.  What defence does White have now?} 19. Qg8+ {Forced.  There is no other way.  White is not going after the a8-Rook.  This is a tempo gaining move to bring the Queen back into defence: a relief column.} Ke7 20. Qg5+ {This came as a minor surprise: I was expecting Qg4 at once.  What the check does is bring the Black King closer to the centre, and that had a bearing on the game as it happened.  I did consider playing 20...f6, but took what I thought to be the simpler course.} Kd6 21. Qg4 {Now the mate is 'off'.  But the relief column - the queen- has done no more than prevent the immediate storming of the walls.  Black has plenty of reserves to reinforce the storming party.} Rg8 {(!?) But Black is deriving as much profit from the siege of White's e2-square as he can.  Of course the rook isn't really 'en prise', no more was he two moves ago.  White can not touch him.  But White's queen has to move again, getting driven in to the closely encircled defences.  ***  As it transpires, Black had an even better move for the win!  Although off and on I did look at ...Ne5, I appear to have overlooked it at this juncture.  As it leaves White's Queen with no sensible moves, and 21...Ne5  22.Rxd4ch leads simply to a huge loss of materialfor White, the game might have ended right here.  Thanks to eduard352 for point this out (see comments).} 22. Qf3 {It was at this point I had a sudden change of mind.  I had intended to take the g-pawn here, and was thinking which piece to do the taking.  Very attractive was 22...Nxg2ch  23.Kf1 Qxf3ch  24.Bxf3 Ne3ch winning the exchange (25...Nxd1), and I near as a toucher played it.  But then I saw something even better...} Qxe2+ {(!) The quickest and easiest road to the win turns out to be this straightforward, even brutish, method.} 23. Qxe2 Nxe2 24. Kxe2 {Black's forlorn hope has been annihilated, but in the process has cleared the breach for the troops following up.} Rxg2+ {And this is the 'point' .  If the King moves anywhere but to d3, 25...Rxc2 gives Black four (4!) passed pawns in the centre, and an overwhelming game.  So I was not surprised to see White's next move...} 25. Kd3 {But now White is in the toils of a mating net.  That is why at move 22 I decided not to play the Exchange winning line.} Kd5 {Threatens ...Ne5#.  The siege - the mating net - tightens.  There is no relief in sight.} 26. Rhe1 {Only defence.} e5 {Threatens mate in two with ...Bf5ch; ...Bxe4#.  If 27.Rf1 then 27...e4#.   White tries something else.} 27. Rdb1 {It made no difference what White played, mate would have happened in a move or two.} Rd2# {White's 13th move set him back seriously, but the decisive moment came 4 moves later after which Black was able to place the White King under a siege from which there was no escape. }
