[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Andreaschek gambit"]

1. e4 {In Paris, Morphy suffered from a bout of intestinal influenza. In accordance with the medical wisdom of the time, he was treated with leeches, resulting in his losing a significant amount of blood. Although too weak to stand up unaided, Morphy insisted on going ahead with a match against the visiting German master Adolf Anderssen, considered by many to be Europe's leading player. Despite his illness Morphy triumphed easily, winning seven while losing two, with two draws. When asked about his defeat, Anderssen claimed to be out of practice, but also admitted that Morphy was in any event the stronger player and that he was fairly beaten. Anderssen also attested that in his opinion, Morphy was the strongest player ever to play the game, even stronger than the famous French champion Louis Charles Mahe De La Bourdonnais...} c5 {Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen was a German chess master. He is considered to have been the world's leading chess player for much of the 1850s and 1860s. Although quite soundly defeated by Paul Morphy who toured Europe in 1858, Morphy retired from chess soon afterwards and Anderssen was again considered the leading player... } 2. d4 cxd4 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nxd4 e6 {not how we would handle this today; we do not want to encourage Nc3, and end up in a closed Sicilian, with the better play for White... better d5, or e5, or maybe Nf6 or a6...} 5. Nb5 {the Taimanov Variation - not yet invented in those days - as always a burdon for Black; especially after Bf4... after a6, Nd6+, Bxd6, Qxd6, Qe7, Qg3...} d6 {better Nf6, N1c3, d6; this pawn will become a weakness...} 6. Bf4 {like clockwork; this is practically forcing e5 to preserve d6...} e5 7. Be3 {there is no doubt, that Bg5, Nf6, Bc4 (threatening Bxf7, followed by Qd5 at some point), Qa5+, Nd2 is much stronger, but Morphy is weaving an intricate trap, involving Nb1-c3-Nd5 to break open c7; so he needs Nb1 for another exhibition...} f5 {threatening f4, to no avail... best here is Nf6, or Be6 to prevent Bc4... after Nf6, N1c3, a6...} 8. Nb1c3 {this is suddenly very strong now...} f4 {after a6, Nd5!, axb5, Bb6, Qh4, Nc7+, and loss of Ra1...} 9. Nd5 fxe3 10. Nbc7+ {only this Knight...} Kf7 11. Qf3+ {Morphy passes by on Nxa8, exf2+, Kxf2, Qh4+, g3, Qxe4, Bg2, with a clear win ahead; after Qh5+, g6, Qf3+...} Nf6 {Black seems out of trouble, for now...} 12. Bc4 {or maybe not...} Nd4 {the only one...} 13. Nxf6+ d5 14. Bxd5+ {after Qxd5, Nfxd5, Nxf3+, gxf3, exf2+, Kxf2, Rb8, White is better... but far from winning...} Kg6 {a tragic failure; after Ke7, Qh5 (the only one to keep an attack going), gxf6 (Nxc2+, Kd1!), Qf7+, Kd6, Nxa8, Nxc2+, Ke2 (Kd1 is losing now), Nxa1, Rc1, White has a lot more to prove... Qe7, Rxc8, Qxf7, Bxf7, Bg7!, and White is still far from winning; now all is over...} 15. Qh5+ Kxf6 16. fxe3 {the next best move again; out of boredom? we will never know... directly winning however is of course f4!, threatening mate on Qg5; after exf4, e5+, Ke7, Qf7 mate; after Bb4+, c3, Ke7, Nxa8, clears all illusions... after Ke7, Qxe5+, Ne6, Nxe6, Qd6, Qg5+, Ke8, Nxg7+, Bxg7, Qxg7, Black can safely give up...} Nxc2+ 17. Ke2 {Black resigns; after Qxc7, Raf1+, Ke7, Rf7+, he loses the Queen...} Qxc7 18. Raf1+ Ke7 19. Rf7+ {After his defeat by Steinitz in 1866, Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he enteredâ€”including the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament, one of the strongest tournaments of the era. He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.  Anderssen is famous even today for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the "Immortal Game" (1851) and the "Evergreen Game" (1852). He was a very important figure in the development of chess problems, driving forward the transition from the "Old School" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.  He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an "elder statesman" of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration...}
