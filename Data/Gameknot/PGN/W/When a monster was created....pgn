[Opening "Reti opening (A05)"]

1. Nf3 {Donald Byrne (1930–1976) was one of the leading American chess masters at the time of this game. He won the 1953 U.S. Open Championship, and later represented the United States in the 1962, 1964, and 1968 Chess Olympiads. He became an International Master in 1962, and probably would have risen further if not for ill health. Robert "Bobby" Fischer (1943–2008) was at this time a promising young master. Following this game, he had a meteoric rise, winning the 1957 U.S. Open on tiebreaks, winning the 1957–58 U.S. (Closed) Championship (and all seven later championships in which he played), qualifying for the Candidates Tournament and becoming in 1958 the world's youngest grandmaster at the age of 15. He won the world championship in 1972, and is considered by many to be the greatest chess player of all time...} Nf6 {In this game, Fischer demonstrates noteworthy innovation and improvisation. Byrne, after a standard opening, makes a seemingly minor mistake on move 11, losing a tempo by moving the same piece twice. Fischer pounces with brilliant sacrificial play, culminating in a queen sacrifice on move 17. Byrne captures the queen, but Fischer gets far too much material for it – a rook, two bishops, and a pawn. At the end, Fischer's pieces coordinate to force checkmate, while Byrne's queen sits, useless, on the other side of the board... } 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. d4 O-O {after a rather peculiar opening sequence, we reached some breed of the Grünfeld Defense; White controls much of the center, but Black has already castled... after e4, d6 (Black needs to prepare c5), Be2, White has solid play...} 5. Bf4 d5 {daring but not too solid; better d6, e4, Nbd7, Be2, c5, d5, Ng4...} 6. Qb3 {there is no doubt, that e3, dxc4 (c6, Qb3), Bxc4, Nbd7, Ne5 would have been much safer...} dxc4 7. Qxc4 c6 {no use, is the so-called Prins Variation Na6; e3, c5, dxc5, Qa5, Be5!...} 8. e4 {also here, e3 would have been much sounder play; after Qb6, Be2, Be6, Qd3, all is well... also Qb3, Nbd7 e3, poses no problems...} Nbd7 {b5, Qb3, Qa5, Bd3, leads nowhere soon; Qb6 might disrupt Whites' play, after Be2, Qxb2, Rb1, Qa3, 0-0, Qa5...} 9. Rd1 {also here Be2 was to be much preferred; after Nb6, Qb3...} Nb6 10. Qc5 {not safe at all; best is Qb3, Be6, Qc2, Bg4, Be2...} Bg4 {just playing the best moves; after this Be2, Nfd7, Qg5, Bxf3, Bxf3, e5, and we trade Queens...} 11. Bg5 {but this is taking too much out of Whites' defenses; absolutely necessary was Be2...} Na4 {this move - which is not bad at all, is dubbed "One of the most powerful moves of all time."  Fischer offers an ingenious knight sacrifice. If Byrne played Nxa4, Fischer would reply Nxe4, leaving Byrne with some terrible choices... } 12. Qa3 {or Qb4, Nxc3, bxc3, Nxe4, Bxe7, a5! (Qb6 is better for White), Qa3, Qd7, Bxf8, Bxf8...} Nxc3 13. bxc3 Nxe4 14. Bxe7 Qb6 15. Bc4 {at this point, Bxf8, Bxf8, Qb3, Nxc3, Qxb6, axb6, Ra1/Rd2, was still worth considering... but now, Fischer is unleashed and pushes another sacrifice...} Nxc3 16. Bc5 {no good either is Qxc3, Rfe8, 0-0, Rxe7, Rde1, Rae8, Ne5, Be6...} Rfe8+ 17. Kf1 Be6 {this must certainly be the move, that made this game famous; a Queen sacrifice upon two earlier sacrifices... the best way out of this is Qxc3, Qxc5, dxc5, Bxc3, Bxe6, Rxe6; Byrne decides to take the Queen, much to his dismay...} 18. Bxb6 Bxc4+ 19. Kg1 Ne2+ 20. Kf1 Nxd4+ 21. Kg1 Ne2+ 22. Kf1 Nc3+ 23. Kg1 axb6 24. Qb4 Ra4 {Blacks' pieces are working nicely together in this stunning windmill variation... White is left without a chance...} 25. Qxb6 {no use either is Qxa4, Nxa4, h3, Bxa2, Kh2...} Nxd1 26. h3 Rxa2 27. Kh2 Nxf2 28. Re1 {slightly better is Qxb7, Bd5, Re1...} Rxe1 29. Qd8+ Bf8 30. Nxe1 Bd5 31. Nf3 Ne4 32. Qb8 b5 33. h4 h5 34. Ne5 {only speeding up the process, but this is lost anyway; tougher is Kh3, Nf2+, Kg3...} Kg7 {breaking the pin over Bf8...} 35. Kg1 {walking straight into mate, out of respect for Bobbys' play; Nxg6 would have been tougher, but also losing...} Bc5+ 36. Kf1 {Kh2, Nd2, takes a while longer...} Ng3+ {and thus, a new windmill emerges...} 37. Ke1 Bb4+ 38. Kd1 Bb3+ 39. Kc1 Ne2+ 40. Kb1 Nc3+ 41. Kc1 Rc2# {or Ba3 mate... after this game, Byrne took up Bobby as a prodigy and mentored him for a long while; they even became close friends... the rest is history...}
