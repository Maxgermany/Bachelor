1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d6 {I thought this was a little passive} 5. e3 O-O 6. Nge2 {I wanted to contest the black squares} c5 7. O-O Nc6 8. Rb1 {I wanted to prepare for getting the black Bishop out} e6 {I'm thankful that he has blocked the white bishop} 9. f4 {Is it a good idea to flank two sides without promoting the center pawns?  Almost didn't do it, but it payed off later} d5 {Rats} 10. d4 {I thought this was the only way to defend the center} cxd4 11. Nxd4 Nxd4 12. exd4 dxc4 {I spend a lot of time figuring how to make up that pawn} 13. h3 {To thwart Ng4...Ne3 fork, still thinking I might push the f pawn, so keep the rook here} Rb8 14. Be3 {Thinking of Qa4, but need to keep the h8-a1 diagonal blocked up} a6 {Forget Qa4} 15. Qc2 {coverin e4 and threatening c4} b5 16. Rfd1 Bb7 {Knew that was coming} 17. b3 {Should have done this earlier - hope it's not to late, considered seriously Ne4, then b4.  Settled on the direct threat} b4 18. Bxb7 Rxb7 19. bxc4 {He can't take c3 or he looses the rook} Qd7 20. Na4 {Originally the plan was Qa4, but had to abandon that} Qc6 21. Nc5 {protecting e4} Rbb8 {he would have done better to move his f rook here} 22. Kf2 {Keeping the queen out of f3 and making mahem.  I am down to 24 minutes on my clock, my opponent has 48 minutes.  I am thinking hard on his time} a5 23. Qa4 {Finally} Qxa4 24. Nxa4 Ne4+ {Of course} 25. Kf3 f5 26. Rb3 {Considered g4, but have 20 some minutes and thought it was too complicated to figure out...choose instead to block the b pawn and eliminate the fork of Nc3.   Preparing d5} Rfd8 {Thwarts d5} 27. c5 {took 7 of my 24 minutes to think about this, the room is HOT, I'm tired and I'm not sure of this move.  Trying to get to 40 moves without too much damage} Rdc8 28. Rdd3 {So the rooks are covering each other in case a file opens} Kf7 29. a3 {I want his pawns} Bf8 30. axb4 axb4 {I'll get that one later} 31. Nb6 Rc6 32. d5 {I use 4 of my 14 minutes to think about this.  Hanging on for 40 moves and more time} exd5 33. Nxd5 Rd8 34. g4 Bxc5 35. Nxb4 Rxd3 36. Nxd3 Bxe3 37. Kxe3 {After I moved, I saw a fork with Ne5 , then realized he could have responded in time with Nd2  and fork} Re6 38. Rb7+ {Motivated by wanting to break any possibility of fork} Kf6 {Kg8 would have protected the h pawn} 39. Ne5 {I just notice g5 is cut off} Ng3 40. Rf7# {}
