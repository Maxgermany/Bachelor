1. e4 {As usual, they also enjoy 1.e4.} c5 {So, Stick to my Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nf3 {As anticipated.} d6 {So, I stick to mainlines.} 3. Bc4 {Last time, they played 3.Bb5.  But, I've seen this move once.  That was, in my loss against one of my students.  The idea here is 4.Ng5, with N fork threat.} e6 {But, they can't fool me since I've seen before.  As the saying goes, "Don't trust your opponent."} 4. O-O {4.Bb5+ is the move that I anticipated, but they decide to get their monarch safety which is a good strategy, especially, when I'm behind in development and center control.} d5 {But, now I play as if black had a SM in mind with 2.Bb5  My idea is exchange pawns to gain tempo.} 5. exd5 exd5 6. Bb5+ {However, they're the ones that gain time.  I knew that this would be played, sooner or later and was waiting for it.} Nd7 {I base things on what reversion has told me.  And, I checked out the game.  In it, he said that best is ...Nd7.  Therefore, the idea is to follow my instinct.} 7. d4 {After what happened in my game against Sue, I know black's evil intention.  They want me to exchange on d5 because Nf5-d4 would pose as a very dangerous threat, in this position.} Ngf6 {So, I don't allow it by declining the exchange, for now.} 8. Bg5 {Meanwhile, they decide to indirectly pin my N.} Be7 {Which I break in the most common way.  After which, white exchanges.  I'm a little surprised because I was once told not take the Knight that's pinned to the Queen.  But, it's beneficial, in this position.  } 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Re1+ {After which, they place me in check.} Be7 {However, I still want to keep my option of castling open.  The only problem is that I have a piece tied down, which gives white an advantage.} 11. Qe2 {As noted from several annotations, a Queen in front of the Rook is, especially, dangerous, but especially in this position.  That's because white's threatening to win a piece, as I saw in my game against Sue.} Kf8 {Therefore, castling is not an option.  Instead, I need an extra defender on f8. } 12. Nc3 {Completing their development.  But, now that it appears safe, this is where I decide to exchange pawns.} cxd4 13. Nxd5 Nf6 {?? Preparing to exchange Knights.  But, this move, however, loses a piece.  After which, white will liquidate.  Since it's no longer pinned, I had to move my DSB off of e7 to prevent this.} 14. Qxe7+ Qxe7 15. Rxe7 Bd7 {?? Completing my development.  The problem was that I did not count how many more defenders they had then me.  By playing this, they'll win another piece.  Might sound contradictory, and thus, strange, but the only other move that came into consideration was 15...Nxd5?? with the idea of winning back material.  However, that would lose immediately because this would give them an immediate back rank mate, with 16.Re8#  With that being said, I'm not sure what the best move was, but something else had to come into consideration.} 16. Bxd7 Nxd7 {? Not a good choice, though.  The idea is that it's liquidation, but I wasn't losing an additional piece.  That was a terrible miscalculation because this loses the exchange, and therefore, further liquidates, as they will take back, which also still adds up to the loss of a piece.  By doing this, they benefit because the idea is to exchange when ahead.} 17. Rxd7 Re8 {And, now, there's no choice but to give up a pawn.  If this weren't played, I thought they would mate after 18.Ng5, followed by 19.Rxf7+  I now understand that they're would be a way around it, but black still winds up in a lot of trouble.  In fact, against opposition like this, I'd normally resign.  The reason it's not happening is due to following the Supplemental Talking Talk Rules which states that you don't resign, until they have a mating sequence.  Sometimes, we don't see it, so it means not resigning at all and letting them mate.  This is one of those times.  And, I want this to blend in with the rules, in order to post in the WTW Annotations Thread as this is good for learning purposes.} 18. Rxb7 Rd8 {Now that they took, I'm not worried about the threat.  Instead, I realized that they're going to grab another pawn.  When this happens, my instincts were to win back a Knight.  Of course, that quickly changes.} 19. Rxa7 f5 {Like the last time, "To take is a mistake."  If I grab they're Nd5, they'll win a Rook, after 30.Ra8+  Now, I can't afford to lose anything else.  Of course, I know that it's lost but it's about playing as well as you can, which is, believe it or not, also part of the WTW rules (not to my surprise).} 20. Ng5 {Preparing to fork my Kf8 and Rd8.} Re8 {But, I stop it.} 21. Rf7+ {So, they place me in check, forcing my next move.} Kg8 22. Ne7+ {After which, they do it again.} Rxe7 {I didn't want to take because of what follows, but unlike before, it's forced.} 23. Rxe7 Kf8 {This wasn't played simply to attack the Rook.  Instead, I remember what happened in my most recent loss against Fred, as we're in a similar situation, believe it or not.  I almost surpassed 25 moves, but made one mistake by leaving my monarch pinned since the Rook did not move off of where it should've been.  Although we can't depend on my inactive Rh8, the same thing applies, but even more so here.  They're threatening an immediate mating net because of white's Ng5.  So, if this weren't played, the next move would be 24.Rd8#  Like that other game, I wouldn't have lasted 25 moves, so the idea was to learn from the mistake and prevent history from repeating itself.  That is, despite being in a lost position, as, unlike before, I've marked down the 25 move mark.} 24. Rae1 {Going for the kill, though.} g6 {Still doing my best because if this weren't played, they'd have the immediate 25.Rf8#  I knew it'd be soon but wasn't completely sure when mate would come.  But, we can conclude and am, thus, happy to say that I've improve since my last game against easy19, despite a 14 point drop, in my rating.} 25. Rf7+ {As anticipated, forcing my next move.} Kg8 26. Re8# {Right after 25...Kg8, but a split second before this, it's when I realized that he'd mate.  A few mistakes led to this moment, but that's the general themes of WTW and/or LTR games.  It's training, learning from your mistakes, and improving which has happened.  Therefore, I am proud of myself.}
