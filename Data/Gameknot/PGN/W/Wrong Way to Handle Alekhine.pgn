[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Steiner variation"]

1. e4 {Random challenge game. I play white and open with my favorite king's pawn.} Nf6 2. e5 {The Alekhine's Defense. It's been 20 years since I played competitively or read a chess book. I seem to recall my understanding of this defense was to build my 4 center pawns up by chasing the black knight - this was considered strong for white. Maybe I am just remembering poorly; I've forgotten a lot in 20 years. In any case, 2. e5 is the main line.} Nd5 3. c4 {The Two Pawns Variation. c4 is a good square for a pawn, threatening the center and relatively unassailable by black pieces. And the move gains a little tempo by chasing the knight off of d5.} Nb6 4. d4 {Heading to the Four Pawns Attack - as said earlier, I thought this was how to handle the Alekhine.} d6 5. f4 {I have achieved my goal.} g5 6. d5 {Black's 5. ... g5 took me by surprise. I even went back to an old opening book and didn't see this line getting much credit.} e6 7. dxe6 Bxe6 8. b3 {My center has already crumbled somewhat and black has a big edge in development.} Bg7 9. Qe2 {Black's development continues to outpace mine. My queen is "developed" as it were, but she blocks my king's bishop, so in essence she un-develops the bishop. I am not liking this approach to handling the Alekhine.} Nc6 10. Bb2 {The development stands at 4 to 2, and I'm purely on the defensive. Yuck.} gxf4 11. Nf3 {And now I've lost a pawn, but at least I'm gaining a little on the development angle.} Nd7 12. exd6 {I liked my opponent's 11. Nd7? (I think it earns a ?) because it let me exchange my precarious e5 pawn and when black recaptures, it will leave him with isolated f and h pawns. Maybe I'll end up with some decent compensation here with black's weak pawn structure. Even better, by capturing with 12. exd6, I expose a bishop attack on the long diagonal, so black cannot immediately recapture at d6.} Bxb2 13. Qxb2 {Black exchanged bishops, but now his king's rook is en prise at h8. He still cannot recapture on d6.} Rg8 14. dxc7 {And now I have equalized in material, though I am still behind in development - in compensation, black's pawn structure is a mess.} Qxc7 15. Bd3 {Sneaky. The queen on b2 defends the pawn. I have to admit, I was hoping my opponent would overlook that. Regardless, this move lets me attack one of the weak isolated black pawns, and combined with my queen, seems to open some interesting lines of attack into black's home along those long diagonals.} h5 16. Bh7 Rf8 17. Nc3 {Ahh, development is fairly even, material is even, and black's pawns are still a mess. I think I've reached a viable middlegame here, but I still don't think I handled the Alekhine properly.} Nde5 18. O-O {I just know black is itching to play the royal fork with Nd3 , but my bishop way over on h7 denies him the square. Still, taking the knight gets his queen further into play, and I don't want him to take my knight on f3 and isolate some of my pawns. Also, he might just chase away that far-flung bishop and get his royal fork. So castling seems a good solution.} Qb6+ 19. Kh1 Nxc4 20. Qe2 {Oooh, 19. ... Nxc4 was very clever - I didn't see that coming. Now I'm a pawn down again, but my queen is ready to discover an attack against the pawn on h5.} Qe3 21. bxc4 {Black might want to trade queens, but that works for me. It lets me get ahead in material.} Qxc3 22. Ng5 {I am dreading Bxc4, but the bishop is currently pinned. Gotta watch out for it though, if black unpins his bishop. Or, I can just kill the bishop. I am also unmasking a rook attack against the pawn on f4, but while the black queen is threatening my rook on a1, I cannot play my f-rook off of my back rank.} Qe3 23. Qxh5 {I hate running my queen out of the backfield when black's queen is so close to my under-defended and cornered king. Still, it looks safe, I need to balance the material before it is too late. Besides, I'm now building up an strong attack along the e-file, threatening black's queen with a rook and when she moves, either my knight or rook can take the bishop at e6 while his only pawn defender is pinned by my queen.} Ne5 24. Nxe6 {Oops. Black's move, 23. ... Ne5? was a blunder. That bishop only had one defender - the queen at e3. The pawn at f7 is pinned. And now the Knight has a new attack planned at c7 - black needs to see to the defense. And I still have Rae1 in store to force the black queen to move, whereupon my rook or queen can take the knight at e5.} Rh8 25. Nc7+ {24. ... Rh8? was another blunder. I pondered whether I wanted to play 25. Nc7  or 25. Rae1, but finally concluded that, while the latter wins more material, it runs the risk of losing the bishop at h7, and the former leaves the possibility open that I can play both. For example: 25. Nc7  Kd7 26. Nxa8 Rxa8, 27. Rae1 Qmoves 28. Qxe5.} Kd7 26. Nxa8 {Black resigned. Apparently black concluded that he could capture the knight at a8 but then lose his knight at e5, leaving him down by a rook and bishop (and then the pawn at f5 will certainly fall too), or he could save his own knight, but then he his only defense against 27. Bf5  and 28. Qxh8 is to play 26. ... Ng3, which still loses: 27. Rad1  Kc6 28. Qb5# or 27. Qd5  Ke7 (or Ke8) 28. Rae1 and black's queen falls or 27. Qd5  Kc8 28. Qxf7 Ne7 29. Rae1 Qc5 30. Rxe7 with too many checkmate threats for black to counter.}
