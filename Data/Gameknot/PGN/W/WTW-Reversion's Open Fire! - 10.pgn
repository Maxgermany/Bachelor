1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {He plays something I'm used to.} Nf6 {In the future, I'll allow a stronger opponent to play the Ruy Lopez or Guaco Piano.  But, reversion, to make a long story short, advised me to try different defenses in this tourney since the idea is learning.  One thing he mentioned was the Petrov Defense.  And, after seeing it's starting position in tipsyjourneyman's mini tourney which I, regretfully, had to decline (in order to avoid being put at too many games, more then 6 at one time.)  However, this was the position, and I have a little basics in it because the first defense I played against there was this defense.  At the time, I didn't know it was called that but had bad luck with it.  Times, however, have changed, and as I became stronger, I cope with things better.  That even includes things against something against Caro Kann which elyhim annotated.} 3. d4 {I figured that he played this to open up the center, as you do with the Philidor's, or French, or Caro Kann.  In general, 1...e6 is played.  Maybe, he wanted to follow the same logic.} exd4 {Already starting to get distracted about the vacation combined with knabbing a pawn early, I took.  Better, however, was 3...Nc6 because of his next move.  The idea being that his next move, as we often see in the French Defense, can be of bad omen.  The position still holds, but I don't like having to deal with it. } 4. e5 Qe7 {I figured that this move would prevent the loss of tempo.  I also beared in mind that he can't win my Nf6, as his e5 is now pinned.  Being hyperfocused on General Openings would've resulted in the loss of time.  But, one thing I did remember was not to focus on chess terms, or bits and wisdom.  That's how I found this move.} 5. Be2 {But, I overlooked this move as the pin is now broken.  And, with it, my Knight is now attacked.} Ng8 {?! It appears that any other move would've lost my Knight.  This is where that distraction, however, starts to become ugly.  Instead of calculating, I assumed.  So, this means the failure to access the position which, as he also noted especially with the training, is vital.  And, that's why I'm frustrated.  Usually, I don't just forget things like that.  And, in general, it's prevented.  The only reason for this failure was out of an unusual, "Fight or Flight" situation which as, unbermensch43 noted followed by me telling some of my students, chess is not supposed to be that way.  But, it happened here.  Now, for some more thought process, I know how it happened as things like this have become reality.  And, it, believe it or not, occured here.  It was the fear of losing too much sleep.  It ended minimally better then expected.  With that being said, my worry was that I wouldn't get more then 6 hours of sleep which would make me tired.  I actually got 15 minutes more then that and lasted a little longer then expected.  But, about 2 hours, after landing, I was exhausted.  My worst fear did not come true which was not being able to study a book by GM Susan Polgar called, "Chess Tactics for Champions" due to my fatigue.  Better was 5...Ng4, but the assumption was that, after he gives a discovered attack by moving his Nf3, I would not have been able to protect my N.  What didn't come into calculation was 6...Nh6, and now taking would be to my benefit since his Bc8 is stronger.  Calculating better and doing my Homework here would've made the situation better.} 6. O-O {So, after that error which hindered my K side, he takes advantage by castling.} Nc6 {So, I try to come with a plan.  The idea is, sooner or later, castling Q side which he'll prevent.} 7. Re1 {Therefore, he goes right for it by centralizing his Rook.} Qc5 {With the disadvantage I'm at, I try to come up with a plan that will a pawn.  My plan is, actually, unsound and easy to drive off.  Not to my surprise, it doesn't work.  With that being said, here's the thought process.  The idea here 8...Nb4, followed by 9...Qxc2  Usually, I don't play like this, but as noted in the intro and for the same reason it was a rough weak.  Particularly, less then 4 days before going away.} 8. c3 {And, this is how he stops that plan.  The idea being that for the obvious reason, I can't move my Nc6-b4.} dxc3 {Trying to stop him from getting a pawn back, I take.} 9. Nxc3 {But, it does not work, once he takes back.} Nxe5 {?? I was much more distracted then before.  Stopping the game and trying to come back would not have worked since this distraction happened for the rest of the week leading to, as noted, close to a fatal mistake two days prior.  Without calculating (which is unheard of for me, these days), I got greedy and took his pawn.  Had I paid better attention and not been distracted, this would not have come close to consideration, as now, I'm losing a piece, in return.  I'm not sure what the best move, but had I been more alert, 9...d6 would've been played, instead with the idea of getting my Bc8 out and castling, at once.} 10. Nxe5 Bd6 {Without giving it much thought, as noted, this was played to try and intimidate this runner.  I figured that I'd get something out of it.  I knew that he'd retreat, but the joke is on me (as the saying goes).  That's because I'm about to be punished when he reattacks.} 11. Nd3 Qa5 {Going for, just about, anything, I decide to pin his N.  This time, however, I anticipated his next move.  That's because my initial thought was that 12.b4? because of what I play which is the fatal mistake.} 12. b4 Bxb4 {?? Had I given this more thought and done my HW, I would've calculated better.  Therefore, I would've retreated my Queen (which is what should've been done)  But, this, however, is where the distraction was the worst, as now, aside from that thought (which was wrong) I was not with it.  What matters is that I should not have taken.  It was a case of not playing a move just because it looks good which I've taught my students.  But, it's not obvious because it was more then just looking good.  It also boiled down to planning the necessary ways to reduce the sleep deprivation issue, as opposed to, what the threat.  In doing so, unlike what was discussed, I ignored the only way of saving the position, as now, I'm busted.  Yes, I don't lose a piece on the next move, shortly there after, he is going to win my Queen, at the least.  But, instead of taking right away he plays other moves that are even more powerful.  In doing so, he will force a win quickly.} 13. Nxb4 Qxb4 14. Nd5 {This is where the trouble starts, but I did not know to what extent.  I didn't think it was too bad, and figured that my Queen was protected.  But, after 15.Bf4 is played, that's when I start to realize it.  Despite that, however, I thought I was still fine until 16.Bb5+  And, that's when everything changed, realizing the extent. } Qd6 15. Bf4 Qc6 16. Bb5+ Qe6 {At the very least, he would win my Queen.  } 17. Nxc7+ {In fact, oddlord could've done that with 17.Rxe6 (since my Queen is pinned.)  Not doing this means that I'm in worse shape then I could've imagined.  In fact, it also implies that I'm lost immediately since because they only let one keep the Queen when a mate is inevitable.  Even with best play, I would not have spotted it, in this position.  But, chess is a language and realizing that is now a good way to learn, in case, I ever have something like this but on the other end. (That is, if this happened and have a mate, which I'd try to take advantage of.)} Ke7 18. Qd6+ Kf6 19. Bd3 Qxd6 {This is where the distraction ends, and I pay attention.  In fact, I'm almost completely aware of what's happening and the vacation is not getting to me, at this point.  But, it's too little, too late.  I didn't play this for the thrills and giggles of winning the Queen.  Instead, I figured that oddlord would mate with his Queen and Nc6.  So, playing this was the only way to save the position.  In other words, this is where I thought that the worst was over.  But, after the game was over, I analyzed, and no matter what I would've played, it was over with his next move because this is a mating net which is also why he did not take my Queen.} 20. Ne8# {And, what I learned is that, like with big storms or meetings, as with any schedule, don't think about it too much.  In other words, it's good to plan things out in advance, but don't let it distract you.  Instead of having that as the first thing on your mind, it's better to put it aside and focus on chess first.  This means that concentrating on what's important such as the threat and how to save the position should be the first thing on one's mind.  Then, when you're not on the chessboard or at work, that's when it becomes appropriate to think about planning the vacation.  Therefore, it is a perfect example on how thought process plays a role and where they must be changed.  So, as a way for me to remember and change the way I'm thinking: there is always a time and place to do it.  And, when it's not that time, it should be put aside until appropriate.  Therefore, the moral is as was (before I started playing chess), to think about, "the here and now".}
