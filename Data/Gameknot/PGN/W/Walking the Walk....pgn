[Opening "King's Indian (A48), East Indian defence"]

1. d4 {I still don't have much of an opening repertoire.  Need to work on that.  This game, my poor opening put me at a disadvantage beginning at about move 7.  Well, it isn't exactly a poor knowledge of openings but rather a few bad decisions during the opening that got me in to trouble early in this game. } Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 {Black plays the King's Indian, East Indian defense (I don't know this from experience or study. I looked it up).  Seems to be a variation of the Reti system or Benko opening, except in reverse.} 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 Bg7 5. e3 O-O 6. Bd3 {6. Bb5 here might have been better.  Here, and perhaps earlier, I saw that black would probably play c5 at some point and then bring his bishop out behind.  } c5 7. b3 {Should have played pxp, or even BxN.  I can't believe I made this move!!  } Nc6 {as expected. and not good.} 8. O-O Nh5 9. Bg5 {well, the game is pretty much set and done here.  ...my d-pawn is attacked three times (and my N is unprotected due to unwise 7. b3).  To mitigate, I relieve the workload on my e-pawn. Probably should have played 9. Be5 here.  Around this time, I did have a plan to sacrifice some material in exchange for damage to black's f, g & h pawns.  But he did not play into that.  } h6 10. Bh4 cxd4 11. exd4 {There are a few interesting moves further along in the game.  But the impending unfavorable exchange has me deflated.  My sense of being "in the game" has gone out of me.  Nevertheless...} Nxd4 12. Re1 {...I try to have have some fun with the game.} Nxf3+ 13. Qxf3 Bxc3 14. Bxe7 {some decent action.} Qe8 15. Bxf8 Bxe1 16. Bxh6 {That bishop has captured a rook and two pawns and is in a position that has some potential.  But his work is essentially done.  He has some influence during the game but never leaves that square.} Bc3 {uck, blockade.} 17. Rd1 Qe5 18. g4 Nf6 19. h3 Qc7 20. Bc4 {This is pretty much my only creative move the whole game...  } Be5 {But black is not going to give up control of the a1-h8 diagonal.} 21. Bxd5 {Regains the pawn I had lost at 10, but is really only the beginning of the end (well, the middle of the end).  Still, moves 12 to 22 were fun (and the computer analysis doesn't complain about any of our moves in this stretch, though it notes I am down throughout).  } Nxd5 22. Qxd5 Be6 {Black's beautiful bishop pair comes together here and will not be overcome.} 23. Qe4 Re8 24. c4 {Not wanting black's bishop back on c3, this move gives my pawns a chance at some mobility.  Well that was the theory. They never move. } Bf5 25. Qd5 {The only way I can get to the relative safety of d2.} Be4 26. Qd2 {The computer suggests I should have gone to d7, but wants black to not exchange queens.  I pictured an exchange.  May still have been best.} Bh2+ 27. Kf1 Qc6 28. f4 {The better of two poor options to avoid checkmate.  Computer disagrees but again thinks black will avoid a queen exchange.} Bf3 {The main enjoyment of this game, watching and learning from black's excellent employment of his bishops, ...very well supported bishops.} 29. Qc3 {Here I feel I've done well to still have my queen and be relatively close in material.  For a moment I have some optimism that I might be able to extend the game a bit.} f6 {how rude :)} 30. Re1 {Very frustrated here.  I couldn't lift the rook to d2 or d3.  And black's rook has been controlling the e-file and isolating my king for several moves.  So, this instead of c1 (or b1 or a1 etc). The thought that there might be some way to engineer a forced draw entered and quickly exited my mind around this time. } Rxe1+ 31. Kxe1 {Capture with king instead of queen in the hope of avoiding loss of kingside pawns.} Qe4+ {Beautiful use of bishop-pair and queen closes out the game.} 32. Kd2 {Black can keep me in check or pin my queen from here on.} Qe2+ 33. Kc1 Qd1+ {Expert positioning of queen will soon provide ideal support of B to wrap up game.  Good lesson for me.  I would have won if I had black's pieces.  But I would not have had the focused precision that brings about the quick end here.  For example, I thought black might play 33. ...Qf1 and then capture my pawn and bishop. How unnecessary and inelegant.   } 34. Kb2 Bg1 {Bishops now fully mobile again, poised to hunt down and kill.} 35. Ka3 {avoids pin and fork and, I think, will allow me a moment of freedom.} Bd4 {I resign.  Continuation only leads to loss of queen on the fifth or sixth rank in a few moves. More lessons here. In the scenarios I played out for this move by black, I was looking at what pieces might check my king and how that would lead to the win.  Black's vision is much more clean and his play much more efficient.  The computer calls this a "blunder" by black and prefers 35. ...Bc5+.   I think this computer has no appreciation for art.   Thank you to ionadowman for a great game.}
