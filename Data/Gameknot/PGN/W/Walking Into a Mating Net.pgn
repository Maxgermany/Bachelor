1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Bc4 e6 5. d3 d5 6. exd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. h3 Qc7 10. Ne2 a6 11. Ba4 {Ba4?? loses a piece, BxN was necessary, although black is slighly better.} b5 12. Bb3 c4 13. dxc4 dxc4 14. Bxc4 bxc4 15. Bf4 Qb6 16. b3 Nd5 {Nd5?? loses a piece, the move order was supposed to be 16...Rd8 followed by Nd5.} 17. Qxd5 Be6 {Black is now behind a pawn but hopes to gain it back by aggressive play. } 18. Qd2 Rfd8 19. Qc1 Bf6 20. Rb1 cxb3 21. cxb3 Rac8 22. Be3 Qa5 23. a3 {23 a3?? is the mistake Black was looking for. White miscalculates the resulting move sequence.} Nd4 {White has nothing but a choice of evils.} 24. b4 {b4?? compounds White's problems. Relatively best was perhaps 24 QxR!?, RxQ, 25 Ne2xd4 with a rook and piece for the queen. } Rxc1 25. bxa5 Nxe2+ 26. Kh2 Rxf1 27. Rxf1 Nc3 {Black is a piece ahead and is better placed as well.} 28. Rc1 Rd1 29. Rc2 h6 {Protects against the back rank threats.} 30. g4 {White wants to get the king out but this weakens the defences and white squares prematurely.} Bd5 31. Kg3 Ne4+ 32. Kf4 {32 Kf4?? sets up the white king an interesting and instructive mating net. Though Kh2 was objectively better, waiting for the axe to fall was not very pleasant.} g5+ 33. Kf5 {Forced!} Kg7 {Threatens 34... Nd6 mate} 34. Bc5 {Stops one mate threat but Black is not finished....} Nxc5 {Again threatens mate, White must take.} 35. Rxc5 Bxf3 {Not only wins the piece, but threatens Bd5 followed by Be3 mate as well as Rd4 followed by Rf4 mate.} 36. a4 {White is going to try fora stalemate after a rook sacrifice, but does not have the time.} Rd4 {White resigns, mate is inevitable.}
