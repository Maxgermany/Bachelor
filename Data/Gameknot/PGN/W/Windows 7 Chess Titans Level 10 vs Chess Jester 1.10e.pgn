[Opening "English (A34), symmetrical variation"]

1. c4 {English (A34), symmetrical variation  Annotated by me and some help from Rybka. The ratings are simply my estimates for both programs.} c5 2. Nc3 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. e3 {This move gives room for the white bishop and also reinforces the center d4.} Bxc3 5. dxc3 d6 {This move basically prevents white from taking advantage of the e5 square.} 6. Be2 {6. e4 Bg4 is slightly better.} Nf6 {Even game thus far.} 7. O-O Nc6 8. b3 O-O 9. Bd2 Qa5 10. a3 Qb6 11. b4 Bf5 12. b5 {Seems like an okay move. 12. Nh4 would threaten the black bishop (12. Nh4 Be6 13. f4 Ne4)} Na5 {Na5 gives a small advantage to white.} 13. h4 {Alternate moves: 13. Bc1 Rfd8 14. Bb2 a6.} Bg4 {13. ...Be6! attacks the c4 pawn.} 14. Bd3 Nd7 15. e4 Ne5 {Obvious threat here is Nxd3.} 16. Qe2 {A move like 16. Bg5 Rfe8 is alright.} Nxd3 {Although this does not seem bad its not the best. 16. ...Nb3 (bring that Knight more into play and attacks 3 pieces at once) 17. Rad1 Qa5 Bc1.} 17. Qxd3 Be6 18. Bh6 {Perhaps 18. Rfb1 is more interesting.} Bxc4 19. Qb1 {19. Qe3 Bxc1 20. Bxf8 Rxf8 21. Rxf1 Qxb5 (gives black a significant advantage).} Bxf1 20. Bxf8 {At least worth considering: 20. Qxf1 Rfc8.} Bxg2 21. Kxg2 Rxf8 22. a4 c4 23. Kg1 {Waste of time.  23. Nd7 places the knight in a better spot.} Qc5 24. Qb4 {Not a great move.  White should keep the queen while he can. 24. Qf1 Qh5 25. Qh3 Nb3 is better but still opponent has advantage.} Qh5 {Here the queens should have been exchanged.} 25. Ne1 Nb3 26. Ra2 Qg4+ 27. Ng2 Qxe4 28. Rb2 Nc5 29. Qa5 {Here white is thinking of perhaps pushing the pawn to b6.} Ra8 30. b6 Nd3 31. Rc2 {I am confused why this move was made (other than to avoid the Knight). The following looks much more interesting: 31. Qxa7 Rxa7 32. bax7 Nxb2 33. a8Q+ Kg7 (still though black is winning).  } Qg4 {Certainly the reason for doing this move is okay. 31. ...Ne5 is better though 32. Qxa7 Rxa7 33. bxa7.} 32. f3 Qxf3 33. Rd2 Nc1 34. Kh1 Nb3 35. Qg5 Nxd2 36. Qxd2 axb6 37. Qc2 Qg3 38. Qc1 Rxa4 39. Qe1 Qh3+ 40. Kg1 Ra2 {Black has basically won at this point.} 41. Qf2 Rxf2 42. Kxf2 Qxc3 {White resigns. (Rybka says: Mate in 12).}
