Some years ago a gameknot player Maxistar tried to test me on this theory and he too failed.  } Nfd7 {only move } 9. Nb5 {Alternative variation: 9. Ne4 dxe5 10. Nd6+ Ke7 comes to the same thing, Alternative variation: while 9. exd6 O-O [is harmless] Alternative variation: and 9. e6 [?] 9... fxe6 10. dxe6 Nb6 [!] Favors black } dxe5 10. Nd6+ Ke7 {! Alternative variation: 10... Kf8 [?] 11. Nf3 [!] leaves the rook on h8 out of the game  } 11. Nxc8+ {Alternative variation: Naturally ] 11. Nb5 [?!] is met by 11... Re8 [!] 12. d6+ Kf8 13. Nc7 exf4+ 14. Nxe8 Qxe8+ 15. Be2 Ne5 16. Bxf4 Nbc6 [ Smirnow-Kapengut, Minsk 1979 0-1] } Qxc8 12. Nf3 {Alternative variation: 12. d6+ [?] allows black to use the c6-sqaure 12... Kf8 13. Nf3 Nc6 14. Bc4 Nb6 15. Bb3 e4 [and black went on to win in Baumbach-Polugayevsky, Bad Liebenstein 1963] } e4 {!? is somewhat risky after 13.Ng5 Alternative variation: 12... Re8 [!] It is very logical to centralize the rook 13. fxe5 Nxe5 14. Bb5 Nbd7 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 is in black's favor } 13. Ng5 h6 {?? is very pleasant for white Alternative variation: 13... Nb6 [!] 14. d6+ Kf8 with far from unfavorable complications for black in [Kooiman-Povah, London 1976] } 14. Nxe4 {! } Re8 15. Be2 f5 16. Nc3 {Monhring-Postler, Frankfurt 1977 1-0 } a6 {? Alternative variation: 16... Kf8 [!] 17. O-O Nb6 is a better position for black. } 17. O-O Kf8 {?! This is a bit of a waste of time now since white has already castled.  Alternative variation: 17... Bd4+ [!] 18. Kh1 Nf6 with the intention of playing ...Kf7 on the next move } 18. Bf3 Nf6 {? a natural looking move that does nothing to wrestle the initiative from white.  Alternative variation: 18... c4 [!] 19. g4 Nf6 20. h3 Nbd7 21. gxf5 gxf5 calls white on his bluff! } 19. Re1 Nbd7 {? Alternative variation:  Necessary is 19... Rxe1+ [!] 20.

Be3 Nc5 {as I said earlier exchanges almost always favor black in the Benoni } 22. Rxe8+ Nxe8 {! Black has managed to neutralize white's building momentum  } 23. Rb1 {? not sure what the effectiveness of this move is over. Na4 Alternative variation: 23. Na4 Nxa4 24. Qxa4 [⩲] } Nd6 {Black's strong grip on e4 guarantees equality } 24. Na4 {? This is clearly not in white's favor but he has nothing better to do } Nxa4 25. Qxa4 Qc7 {Black IMO has achieved a slightly favorable position as his queen pawns are not as fixed compared to white king-pawns } 26. Qb4 Kf7 {?? It is understandable that black would think of dodging the Queen-Bishop battery on the a3-f8 diagonal but... Alternative variation: 26... b5 [!!] 27. Bc5 Rd8 [!] and white will have to waste two tempo just to avoid getting squeezed off the board on the queen side } 27. Bc5 Bf8 28. Qb6 Rc8 {The exchange of queen's is in black's favor} 29. Qxc7+ Rxc7 30. Bb6 Rd7 31. Kf2 Nc8 {I would have played 31...Bg7 before ...Nc8 to try and avoid the mess on the dark squares that results from this move and before the bishop gets stuck to the defense of d6.  } 32. Bd4 b5 {Alternative variation: 32... Ne7 [!?] 33. Bc5 b6 34. Bxb6 Nxd5 35. Be3 Nxe3 36. Kxe3 g5  is also good for black} 33. Re1 Ne7 34. Re5 Bg7 {? The bishop has to stay on f8 to eye d6 this is why 31...Bg7 was preferable to 31...Nc8 Alternative variation: 34... b4 [!] 35. d6 Rxd6 36. Bc5 Rd7 37. Bxb4 Bg7 38. Re2 Nd5 39. Bxd5+ Rxd5 40. Re7+ Kg8 is a draw } 35. d6 {! black is just one step behind white and as a result is now in tough} Rxd6 36. Rxe7+ Kxe7 37. Bxg7 {In this case where there are many pawns on the board the advantage goes the bishops.  } h5 {?? Alternative variation: 37... Rd7 [!?] 38. Ke3 (38. Bxh6 [??] 38... Rd2+ 39. Ke3 Rxb2 [−⁠+])38... Ke6 39. Bxh6 Rd3+ 40. Ke2 Kf7 41. Bg5 Rd6 [⩲] } 38. Bc3 Kf7 39. Bb7 {The Bishops swarm and the rook is caught like a deer in headlights} Rb6 40. Bd5+ {!! With the king squeezed out of the centre the black pawns have no chance and the black rook is hopelessly out classed! } Ke8 41. Be5 a5 42. Ke3 a4 43. a3 b4 44. Bxc4 bxa3 45. bxa3 Rb1 46. Bd6 Rb2 47. Kf3 Rc2 48. Bb5+ {1-0 a game could have easily been won by black. However, a few small errors late in the game cost him. Well played by both players}
