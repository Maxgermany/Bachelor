1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. Bd3 Bd6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Nc3 c6 7. Ne2 O-O 8. Re1 Re8 9. Ng3 Nd7 10. b3 {Here is where I decided to play the bishop sacrifice - expecting it to be refused.} Qc7 11. Bxh7+ Kxh7 {Opponent took, to my surprise, since it leaves the king badly exposed.} 12. Ng5+ Kg8 13. Qh5 {Here I was nicely in position, but it was morning, I had not slept and instead of going to bed, I thought I could finish the game.,....bad idea.} Nf6 {This is the point we had reached before I made a stupid and tired mistake. For some reason I forgot about the Knight threat to the queen and skipped a move ahead - the result was, of course disaster. This annotation shows what I intended to play...} 14. Qxf7+ {Queen moves into aggressive mode. King move forced.} Kh8 15. Bb2 {Fiancetto bishop to get more pieces into attack. Now there is a clear mate : 16. Bxf6 Nf5 17, Rxe8+ Bf8 18. Qxf8# So black must support Night on f6 } Neg8 {This seems to be best move for black. } 16. Rxe8 {Rook now joins attack.} Qxf7 {Black must simplify to reduce mating threats, so exchange queens.} 17. Nxf7+ {knight retakes} Kh7 {Forced move} 18. Bxf6 {Bishop seeks to hasted the end...if black retakes with pawn then : 19. Nxd6 Kg7 20. Rxc8 Rxc8 21 Nxc8  - and white can then simply take his time and use overwhelming material advantage in end-game. If back retakes with Knight then: 19. Rh8+ Kg6 20. Nxd6 and as before... Best move for black is:} Bxg3 {I'll show one likely continuation of this position in the following....} 19. hxg3 Nxf6 20. Rh8+ Kg6 21. Nd6 Ne4 22. Rxc8 Rxc8 23. Nxc8 Kf6 {At this point white can slowly exploit material superiority and either go pawn grabbing or advance f pp for queen - black would be unable to stop it.}
