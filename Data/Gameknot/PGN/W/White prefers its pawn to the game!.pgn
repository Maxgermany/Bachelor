1. d4 {Here i am again boring you with another of my games but here we go any way} e6 {to play a different opening to my usual d5 i played the often played e6} 2. e4 {he gets straight into control of the centre} d5 {but he can't hog it all- white has to share the centre} 3. e5 {now this is a position i usually want to avoid because often from such positions, i feel at a loss how to get at the king apart from when it castles} c5 {but i still can break this formation by the strength of pushing my pawn to c5, threatening to involve my bishop into the game!} 4. c3 {not uncommon but if i were white i would have tried to avoid that} cxd4 {so i play the obvoius} 5. cxd4 {now, though it is a similar position to before, whites defences are much weaker and i have opened up my line of attck for my bishop!} Nc6 {push right into the developing of pieces} 6. Nf3 {so does he} Bd7 {a subtle hint that my knight is likely to advance further} 7. Bb5 {not exactly pinning my knight in a dangerous way, in fact it can be an exscuse to move the knight} Nxe5 {which i take obvious advantage of!} 8. dxe5 {if i were him, i would have done BXd7+} Bxb5 {but here i get a point ahead} 9. Nc3 {he keeps developing} Bb4 {but i like where my white-squared bishop is placed, so play the pinning move} 10. Nd4 {i'm not certain why white would play that?} Bd7 {but i still pull my bishop to safety just in case} 11. O-O {now that knight is no longer pinned} Ne7 {but i had other plans not regarding that knight} 12. Bg5 {another pin!} Qc7 {i get rid of that pin} 13. Bxe7 {he takes} Bxe7 {i still want to keep my lead} 14. Rc1 {now his rooks are starting to get involved as well, making this whole affair more exciting!} Qxe5 {but i think white forgot about that stranded pawn!} 15. Re1 {now white also wants my queen!} Qf6 {but i'm the type of people who would drop down to blunders!} 16. Ndb5 {where is that knight sneaking off to?} Bxb5 {let's have swap off! eh?} 17. Nxb5 {here comes another knight! What to do?} O-O {here we are- why not get my most essential piece in the game out the way!} 18. Rc7 {going for my pawns!} b6 {not that one thank you!} 19. Nxa7 {i don't really mind that because i've got plans} Bd6 {first lets threaten that rook} 20. Rd7 {oops i forgot it could move there} Bb8 {but now i can force that knight to move!} 21. Nc6 {ha ha} Rxa2 {now i've earned that pawn back} 22. b4 {what? why? well...} Qxf2+ {here goes the forced mate} 23. Kh1 {only option and...} Qxg2# {poor old white, because one silly mistake it lost the game a bit too early than anticipated! CHECK MATE!}
