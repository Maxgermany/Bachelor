[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 {This is one of the longest blitz games I've played, with both of us getting right down to the wire on our timers. A big pawn block develops in the center and some slow positional play develops with two Bishops facing off against a Bishop and a Knight. I open with the English and the bind I set up on d5 leads to the central pawn structure the last fifty moves of the game revolve around. Thanks for the game, finicius!} Nf6 2. g3 {My preferred line in the English.} d6 {This is a little passive for my tastes.} 3. Bg2 c6 4. Nc3 {Black's pawn on d6 makes me think he's intending ...e5 or ...c5, which could leave the d-pawn weakened and make it more difficult to advance to give Black's DSB space to maneuver. With that in mind, I choose a standard developing move that continues to bear down on d5.} a6 {This is a bit mysterious to me. It seems to indicate ...b5, but that doesn't actually seem to be a serious threat.} 5. e4 {I don't want to let Black play ...d5 in the event he wins my c-pawn. His position is a little cramped; I want to keep it that way.} e5 {Black locks my king-pawn in place, but now his d-pawn is backward and weak.} 6. Nge2 {I want to get ready to play d4, without blocking in my Bishop any more than necessary.} Be6 {Threatening c4.} 7. b3 {Reinforcing c4. Another option would have been 7. e3, but I didn't want to tie the d-pawn to defense.} c5 {Black begins to lock d4 in return. d5 is now terrifically weak.} 8. O-O {? I'm about to lose my chance to play d4, but I'm not pressed for time on castling. I should have played 8.d4 here, with the chance to advance to d5 if necessary, and preventing ...Nc6 for the time being (8.d4 Nc6 9.d5 wins a piece).} Nc6 {Now it is too late for d4.} 9. Bb2 Nd4 {This starts the dominoes falling: the center is about to become very tough to navigate.} 10. Nxd4 exd4 11. Nd5 {Moving up to a solid post on d5, expecting to open some space for my Bishop while preventing Black from advancing his doubled d-pawn and trading it off.} Bxd5 12. exd5 Be7 {Preparing to castle and staving off a check from a White Rook.} 13. Qe2 {Not so much intended to pin the Bishop as to get the Queen moving towards a more active location.} O-O 14. Rfe1 {Threatening the Be7, though mostly as a formality to ensure he doesn't play anything surprising while I get a presence on the e-file.} Re8 {Logical.} 15. Qd3 {I get the Queen out of the way of Black's Rook and begin to put a little pressure on d4 and h7.} Bf8 {It's not like this Bishop has many prospects on e7...} 16. b4 {This is a bit of a futile effort to assault the pawn chain, but I feel obliged to try. Black has a Knight against my Bishops, which could be a losing proposition for me if the board locks up much more.} b6 17. Ba3 Rxe1+ {?! Black pulls my Rook away from the queenside, at the cost of control of the open e-file.} 18. Rxe1 Qd7 {Setting up ...Re8.} 19. bxc5 bxc5 {The pawn chain stands, and is now almost unassailable from either side.} 20. Bb2 {There's nothing left to do on a3, but I want to allow myself the option of playing Rb1 if necessary.} Re8 21. Rxe8 {Drawing the BQ away from her defense of f5. I want to get behind that pawn chain somehow.} Qxe8 22. Qf5 Qd7 23. Bh3 {If we're going to make this trade, I want to do it on my terms, while getting my Bishop into a better position.} Qxf5 24. Bxf5 g6 {Black finally lets his DSB out.} 25. Bc8 {With the Black Bishop locked on the kingside, I think I can win the a-pawn.} a5 26. d3 {Setting up Bc1-d2.} Bh6 {Blocking my Bishop momentarily.} 27. f4 Ng4 {?? Black overlooks my Bishop entirely.} 28. Bc1 {?? Playing too quickly, I completely miss the free Knight that Black just tried to give me.} Nf6 {It was a one-time offer.} 29. Kg2 {I want to get ready to quickly repel any more intrusions on the kingside while I work on the a-pawn.} Ne8 {Black begins a long march to assault my pawn at d3.} 30. Bd7 Nc7 31. Bd2 a4 {? This pawn is lost whatever Black chooses to do with it. There are better things he could do with his time, like try to get his Bishop into play with ...f6 and ...g5.} 32. Bxa4 Na6 33. a3 {This is all it takes to keep d3 safe.} f6 {Preparing for ...g5 in an attempt to free Black's miserable Bishop.} 34. Bb5 Nc7 35. Bd7 g5 36. f5 {For now, the g-pawn is pinned to the Bishop it was trying to free, so I take the chance to lock the kingside down further as I get ready to march, or rather crawl, to victory on the opposite flank.} Kf8 37. Ba5 {I can trap the Knight if it decides to stick around. Otherwise, I can drive it off and queen the a-pawn with ease.} Na6 {The valiant Knight chooses death.} 38. Bc8 Nb4 {38...Nb8 39. Bc7 is no better. The text line at least breaks up the pawns on Black's terms.} 39. axb4 cxb4 40. Bxb4 Ke7 41. g4 {Black's DSB has done next to nothing all game, and now its position is even more hopeless than ever.} Bf8 {This is the only spot it might still see use.} 42. Kf3 {d4 is indefensible.} Kd8 43. Be6 Kc7 44. Ke4 Kb6 45. Kxd4 Be7 46. Kc3 {I start to end-around all the debris on the board to get into position to force a pawn through.} h6 {Black is just marking time.} 47. d4 Bf8 48. Kb3 Be7 49. Ka4 Bf8 50. Ba5+ {This is the beginning of the end, as I slowly drive the BK away.} Ka6 51. Bc8+ Ka7 52. Kb5 Kb8 53. Bd7 Ka7 {It's about here that I realize that I might not need to promote--I can finagle a KBB mate right here in this tiny corner, as long as I don't screw up too badly--the timer is running out fast.} 54. Bb6+ Kb7 55. Bd8 {I can't let the BK out of this corner or the mate's off.} Bg7 {Black is (as he has been) out of options.} 56. Bc6+ Kc8 57. Be7 Kc7 58. c5 {The King is stuck, the Bishop is helpless, and pawns are coming.} dxc5 59. dxc5 Kc8 60. d6 h5 61. gxh5 {? This is needless; correct is 61. Kb6 hxg4 62. d7+ Kb8 63. Bd6#} Bh8 62. h3 {? Again, just wasting time trying to prevent Black from pushing his pawns when there's a mate in three sitting right there.} Bg7 63. Kb6 {Finally, I get around to it.} Bh8 64. d7+ Kb8 65. Bd6# {And so, this tortuous tale of positional pandemonium comes to an end. This was certainly one of the longest (number-of-moves-wise) blitz games I've played on Gameknot, and while not exactly clean, it was certainly fun to play and interesting to analyze. Thanks again to finicius for this game! Comments on the analysis or on the game itself are much appreciated (and if you leave a low rating, please tell me what I can improve!). Thanks for reading; hope you enjoyed it!}
