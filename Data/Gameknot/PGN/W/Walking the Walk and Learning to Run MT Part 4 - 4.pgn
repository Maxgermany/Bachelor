1. d4 {"Attack is the best defense" (at least, for this particular game).} e5 {Englund gambit} 2. dxe5 f6 3. exf6 Nxf6 4. Nf3 Bc5 {Black develops as quickly as possible.} 5. e3 O-O {The black king is not very safe here but the rook is operational after the 5th move.} 6. Bd3 d5 {Black has condemned himself to strong developement moves (because of the weakness of the king)} 7. O-O {Logicas move. Now black's plan is to settle on the center and rush to the kingside.} Qe8 {Occupaying the two open files. Black didn't want to play 7. ... Qe7 because if the queen and the rook have to be doubled at an early stage of the game, it's better to have the queen behind the rook. Furthermore, I thought that the h5 square could be a important place to control.} 8. Re1 {Rook in front of the queen on the semi open file... Dangerous.} Be6 {The a2g8 diagonal has to be occupated by black for the danger will be there.} 9. Nbd2 Nbd7 {Black's developpement is almost completed and has been quick enough.} 10. b3 {White will sson have many attacking possibilities.} Bg4 {So that black decides to launch the first attack without waiting (doubling the rooks or the queen would take at least 2 moves) and after 11. Bb2 black will be in position to attack by 12. e4 or 12. Ne5.} 11. Bb2 Ne4 { If 12. Nxe4 dxe4 with fork attack between th f knight and the d bishop.} 12. c4 {white attacks the weak pawn and menaces to create an open file in c for his queen or his rook (the queen on c3 would be a problem for black).} Nxd2 {Black has no time to loose.} 13. Qxd2 {Now, the queen has moved, black can carry on.} Bxf3 {I hesitated to bring the queen on the h file to have a stronger attack on the king side but I decided it would take too long a time, for white can play Qc3 at any time and it would cause black a lot of trouble } 14. gxf3 {Weakening white's king side} Rxf3 {Material equality, both kings are unsafe, black is better on the semi open files, white pawn structure is weaker (separated in 3 parts), serious threats to come for blackwith the two open diagonals a1h8 and b1h7. The kings weakness make it a dangerous double edged position but the danger is on both sides.} 15. Kh1 {It was an unexpected move (I was sure white would play Kf1) and I realised that the rook would come on g1 to menace g7 which is now a major danger for black.} Qf7 {protecting g7 and menacing Rf3xf2.} 16. Reg1 Nf6 {16. ... Rxf2, menacing the queen would have little interest for white could play 17.Qc3. and defending the d pawn seemed lost of time, for the only chance black has resides into direct king attack (at least that's what I believe) At this stage I counted the moves necessary to get a mating attack, wether for white or for black : white : 17. Rg2 ... 18. Rg1. ... 19. Qc3 ... or 19. Qc2 ... for black : 16. ... Qh5 ... 17. ... Rf8 18. ... Ng4. but if white doubled his rooks on g1 and g2, he would menace g7 and protect f2 and g2. Black needed one more move to bring the bishop on d3 or e 2.} 17. Rg3 {Mistake. White will have to move his rook twice...} Nh5 {... and white loses one tempo. Now The game looks better for black.} 18. Rg2 Rf8 {Black carries on his plan} 19. Bd4 {It seems a mistake to me, for black planed anyway to move the bishop and the right wing pawns are not black's preoccupation.} Be7 {Now, everybody is in position ! (it's like a second developpement phase). "READY..."} 20. Rf1 {White is pretty good defended  and can quickly counterattack (for both sides, all the pieces are on the left side of the board and connected together) but black has strong attacking possibilities "STEADY..."} Bh4 {"GO !"} 21. e4 {The f2 pawn is expensive, white has now 4 pieces to protect it and black cannot bring one more to attack.} g6 {This move was necessary to free the knight from his warding job, protecting g2. It's time for Perceval to go and attack.} 22. exd5 {Black's plan had better to work... If we go to game's end, white will have a far better game but anyway, it's to late to change the dispositions.} Nf4 {The winning move (fork attack, with g6 protection, just in case).} 23. Be4 {White chooses to sacrify the rook.} Nxg2 24. Kxg2 {Black had little other choice (if 24. Nxf3 Qxf3 menacing check)} Rf4 {White's defense on f2 is still powerfull (one rook less but the king is involved in, now), so black has to withdraw (for the moment)} 25. f3 {White has to regain some field but the situation is almost desperate.} Rxe4 {If 26. fxe4 Qxf1 mate.} 26. Qd3 Rf4 {Now white has not enough material to effeciently counterattack.} 27. Bc5 {Last try.} Re8 {Menacing to come on e1 and force a rook trade.} 28. Be3 Rf5 29. Bd2 Rfe5 {Now it's almost finished; White cannot aford to trade material } 30. Bc3 Re5e2+ 31. Kh1 Qf4 {Only way to avoid the mate next move : queen sacrifice but it only gain one tempo.}
