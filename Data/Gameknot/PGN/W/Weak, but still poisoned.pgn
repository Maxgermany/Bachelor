1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 {My favourite.} c6 3. Nf3 {Bad, because Qb6 now forces me out of my lines. } Nf6 {But to play this move or not is a matter of taste.} 4. h3 {So let's continue the bluff. Theory prefers e3, here, but I want to keep e4 as a threat. } Nbd7 5. c3 {Finally guarding against Qb6. } g6 {A quiet line, but solid for me to break. } 6. g4 {Let's go!} Bg7 7. Nbd2 {Preparing e4, nº 1. } O-O 8. Qc2 {Preparing e4, nº 2. } Re8 {Preparing e5. I have to fight that, but my advance comes first. } 9. e4 {Black is still a move behind to play e5. } dxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 11. Qxe4 {Ok, so what? I'm not bad, but black is still very solid. } Nf6 12. Qc2 Nd5 {...as this knight manouver proves. } 13. Be5 {Trying to provoke f6, making my Bc4 a more valuable move. In case of bishop's exchange, we'll have a fuzzy game. } Bd7 {Not releasing the tension. I'm waiting to play g5 until the black's lsb is on the board. } 14. O-O-O Qb6 {Hmmm... does black have an attack on the queenside? Well, just in case...} 15. Bc4 Nf6 {Strange move, but it was not clear who was in charge here. } 16. g5 {Let's make my pawn worth!} Bf5 17. Bd3 Bxd3 18. Rxd3 {Maybe not the right choice, but I thought that a tempo in doubling rooks was interesting to unbalance the position... one side or another. Moreover, I was looking hard at c4...} Nd5 19. h4 {Maybe not the best option. I wanted to assure control over the g5 square, to avoid the nasty Bh6+. But I didn't want to exchange my bishop with no reason. } f6 20. Bg3 Rad8 {I expected e5, here. } 21. c4 {A little "breath" that gave me a tempo to, hopefully, get something back. The idea was c5, but the knight takes the rook with check, which I overlooked badly. } Nb4 22. c5 Nxd3+ 23. Qxd3 Qb5 {I expected Qxc5+, winning anothe pawn. } 24. Qxb5 cxb5 {At least I deflected the pawns and my two angels are more free to fly.} 25. Rd1 a6 26. Bc7 {I planned to set the bishop in c3. e3 would have worked, but it blocks the semicolumn "e" i can use to pressure on with my rook. } Rd5 {Reinforcing e5... I cannot take the bishop out of the diagonal, not now...} 27. Kc2 {With almost no plan. The truth is I am lost!} Rf5 28. Rd3 Rc8 29. Ba5 {If e5, I cannot answer d5 because of e4, forking with a check threat. } Rc6 {I'll say a blunder. e5 would have crushed me. } 30. Kd2 fxg5 31. hxg5 h6 {Ok, so give your damn check in h6, but now the position is looser...} 32. gxh6 Bxh6+ 33. Kc2 {That's all, folks! Well...} Re6 {Ok, now is the moment to risk something. } 34. d5 Re2+ 35. Kb3 Rxf2 {Now it could have been a good idea d5, but...} 36. c6 {...seemed better to me. Anyway, white is still lost, but you know, in blitz... :-)))} bxc6 37. dxc6 {Nice! Of course, RxN leaves me just undefended, since Re8+ is impossible. } Rf8 {?!!! Wow, this suddenly looks interesting! } 38. Ne5 {I think it is the right one, since it threats a lot of squares and guards f3.} Rc8 {Nxg6 threats Rxc6, Nxe7+, recovering the material. Rd8+, RxR, BxR, and black can stop the pawn with Rf8. He will lose it, anyway. } 39. c7 {This is another way. I cannot tell if better or not. } Bg7 {My turn. } 40. Rd8+ Rxd8 {Better was Rf-f8, Nxg6. } 41. cxd8=Q+ Rf8 42. Qd5+ {No hope for black, now. The rest of the game was not actually played. } Kh7 43. Qh1+ Kg8 44. Nxg6 Re8 45. Qc6 Kf7 46. Bb4 Bf6 47. Nf4 e5 48. Qd5+ Kg7 49. Nh5+ Kg6 50. Nxf6 Kxf6 51. Bc3 {}
