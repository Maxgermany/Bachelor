1. c4 {Above all in the unrated games, I want to make experience about English opening.} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 {Four Knights ah!} 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 {Those knights are good to see, aren't they?} 7. O-O {I try to develop as quick as possible of course.} Be6 {He too!} 8. d3 Be7 9. Be3 O-O 10. Na4 {Na4? "A knight on the rim is dim" I know but I think it's better to know why, than to know it without understanding. Am I right?} Nd5 {....He refuses. But above all he did the best of my mistake. Before I was controlling d5 square with Nc3 and now he takes advantage.} 11. Bc5 {In the opening of this game I was fixed about exchanges!!} Bxc5 12. Nxc5 b6 13. Nxe6 {And again!} fxe6 14. Rc1 {In this way I can capture e5 removing the Knight by c6 square.} Nd4 {Was Qd7 better?} 15. Nxe5 Rc8 16. e3 Nb5 17. a4 {I don't like too much that Knight.} Nd6 18. Qb3 {Qb3! I think this move earns a ! point. Are you with me?} Nf7 19. Nxf7 Rxf7 20. e4 {e4. Was Bh3 better?} c6 21. exd5 cxd5 22. Rxc8 Qxc8 23. Re1 Qc5 24. Re2 {To avoid a DISASTER.} Qc1+ 25. Bf1 h5 {h5 to move h4 in the next move I think.} 26. Qc3 {Now, with 3 points up, I have good reasons to try to exchange.} Qg5 27. Qc8+ Kh7 28. Qxe6 {4 points up....Even if I don't like that Queen and that Rook. But I know I can avoid something bad with a good defence, too.} Rf6 29. Qd7 h4 30. Qxa7 {Very risky move...} Qg4 {Qg4!} 31. a5 Rh6 32. axb6 {I still don't defend my king. Damn, Am I crazy?????  just a little.......} hxg3 33. hxg3 Qh5 34. f4 {To avoid DISASTER another time.} Qf3 35. Rg2 Qe3+ 36. Rf2 Qxg3+ {Well, he could take b6...Maybe he didn't see it.....Me neither.} 37. Bg2 Qe3 {I hate that Queen... } 38. Qa2 Qxb6 39. Bxd5 Rg6+ 40. Kf1 Rh6 {Rh6? There's Bd5...} 41. Qb1 Qd4 {Very good move. This move threatens Q:b2 if I choose to not defend b2 pawn with my Queen; same with d3; f4 if I choose to not defend f4 pawn with my Rook and above all Bd5.} 42. Bg2 {Bg2? This is a mistake. Be4 was a lot better.....or not considering Re6?} Kh8 43. f5 Qb4 44. Qc2 Ra6 {Ra6?? Very bad mistake. It's all easier for me now!} 45. Qc8+ Kh7 46. Qxa6 Qg4 {Qg4! But he's a fox! He threatens Qd1#. } 47. Bf3 {I prefer to play quitely....} Qh3+ 48. Ke2 Qh6 49. Qxh6+ Kxh6 50. Rh2+ Kg5 51. Be4 {And now I start to play my easy endgame...} Kf6 52. Rh7 g6 53. fxg6 Ke5 54. g7 Kd4 55. g8=Q {19 points!} Ke5 56. Qd5+ Kf4 57. Qf5+ Kg3 58. Rh3# {Rh3#. I never defeated a 1571 player. It's true it's unrated, it's true he made many mistakes, but it's always good to beat someone else in this way. I mean 18.Qb3 for me it's been a great move. Maybe not for you. Please let me know what you think about this game. Bye!}
