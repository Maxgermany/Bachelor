1. d4 {I was threatening a cheapo on the king side, Bxh6 and if gxh6 his Nf6 goes. Defending against it he walks into exactly the same tactic on the queen side. Bxa6 and if b7xa6 RxNc6. I am not sure I have ever seen similar examples ever in chess. Take a look and see what I mean!} d5 {My opponent now lives and works in London and plays for a London side. However he grew up near me and went to the same school, although a lot later than me. He was born in 1974, me in 1957. I approached this game cautiously. Although I had a higher FIDE rating, he had a higher ECF} 2. c4 {So it is a Queens Gambit.} dxc4 {Accepted.} 3. e3 {This is really a bit of a cheapo. If black tries to hang on to the extra pawn, he loses quickly. 3.	e3	b5 4.	a4	c6 5.	axb5	cxb5 6.	Qf3 and black's rook on a8 goes. However 3. Nf3 or 3. e4 are probably stronger.} e5 {An excellent move.} 4. Bxc4 {I recover the pawn.} exd4 {He takes} 5. exd4 {I take back} Bd6 {Bishop comes out.} 6. Nc3 {My knight develops.} Nf6 {so does his.} 7. Nf3 {and my other knight} O-O {Castles} 8. O-O {Castles} h6 {He stops my bishop developing to g5} 9. h3 {and I stop his.} Nc6 {His other knight comes out.} 10. Re1 {I grab the e file} Bf5 {He develops his bishop.} 11. Be3 {and mine comes out.} a6 {He prepares b7-b5} 12. a4 {And I stop it.} Qd7 {He queen comes out. manacling Bxh3 in some variations.} 13. Bf1 {So I stop that.} Rfe8 {He contests the e file.} 14. Rc1 {My other rook is developed.} Rad8 {And his also.} 15. Nh4 {I attack his bishop.} Bh7 {Bishop drops back.} 16. Qf3 {I am hoping at some stage to get in Bxh6 and if he plays g7xh6 then Qf3xNf6. However I am not threatening it yet, as Be3xh6 unprotects my d pawn. } Bb4 {His bishop comes out.} 17. Red1 {I unpin my Nc3} Nd5 {He gets rid of the threat of Be3xh6 forever, but walks into exactly the same tactic on the other side!} 18. Nxd5 {I take} Qxd5 {He recaptures} 19. Qxd5 {I take again.} Rxd5 {He takes again.} 20. Bxa6 {and a pawn drops. I think best is now Na5 and he is just a pawn down, but he tries to hang on to the pawn.} Nxd4 {An error, but there is some logic. He hopes for 21.	Rxd4	Rxd4 22.	Bxd4	bxa6 with level material, but I have far better.} 21. Bc4 {This!} Rh5 {He attacks my knight} 22. Rxd4 {Now he is just a knight down.} Bc5 {He attacks my rook.} 23. Rf4 {I move it.} Bxe3 {He takes} 24. Bxf7+ {I take with check} Kh8 {His king moves.} 25. fxe3 {I take back and he waves the white flag. Many thanks for reading.
