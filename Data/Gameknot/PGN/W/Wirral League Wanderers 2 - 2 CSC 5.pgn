1. d4 {A couple of days ago I annotated my game from this same match. This was our other win that night, on board 3. I was playing on board 1.} c5 {Just a word about my player, Hiya Ray. In August 2018 Hiya Ray has become the Champion of Britain in the age bracket for Under 12 years old for girls. in 2019 12 year old Hiya confidently won Welsh Championship under 14, shared 1-2 place in Welsh Championship under 16 and won South Wales Megafinal girls under 12-14 with result 6 out of 6. Her ECF grade is 153 - a grade that I was not to reach until I was 18 or 19. She plays for St Johns School in the Junior 4NCL. She plays for me in the main 4NCL, where she has scored 7 wins out of 7 so far. Hiya was born in 2006. Her opponent Max is only a little bit older, born 2003, but both are playing in the main 4NCL usually taking on adults.} 2. Nf3 {She declines a chance to go into Benoni structures with 2. d4-d5} d5 {Max doesn't give her a second chance! This is now the Krause variation. https://www.365chess.com/eco/D02_Queen's_pawn_game_Krause_variation} 3. c4 {Going into the symmetrical (Austrian) variation of the Queen's Gambit.} Nf6 4. g3 {Although this has been seen before, it is a bit unusual, and doesn't score well. cxd5 is more usual followed by e3, dxc5, Nc3, and finally g3.} dxc4 {Black takes.} 5. Bg2 {More usual, and with a better score on opening databases, is 5. Qa4+ regaining the pawn immediately.} Nc6 {Sound development by black, threatening to take on d4.} 6. e3 {White protects d4 again.} Bf5 {The only game I have on my opening databases with the position after white's 6th move is this https://lichess.org/wGx8Q9k7 which continued with 6...e5 and was eventually drawn.} 7. O-O {White castles.} e6 {Black continues to develop.} 8. Ne5 {Given as the best move for white. Fritz gives this position as slightly better for black.} Be4 {Black wisely decides to neutralise the Bg2. Fritz thinks this is best.} 9. Nxc6 {hite takes.} Bxc6 {Black takes back.} 10. Bxc6+ {White takes again.} bxc6 {Black takes back, and now has tripled pawns on the c file} 11. Qa4 {White attacks c6.} Qc7 {Black protects. Fritz prefers Qb6} 12. Qxc4 {White recaptures the pawn. Fritz prefers either 12. dxc5 or 12. Nd2 with equality.} cxd4 {Black correctly takes.} 13. exd4 {White takes back.} c5 {Black hurries to eliminate his only weakness, his pawn on c6. Fritz prefers 13...Bd6 or 13...Rd8 or 13....Rb8 with a slight edge for black.} 14. b4 {Excellent play by the 13 year old! White correctly exploits the pin on the c pawn to win a pawn. Advantage to white now!} Nd5 {Fritz doesn't like this, and neither do I. Black really needs to develop his bishop and castle. I guess the idea behind this move is to protect the queen so that he can take the pawn.} 15. dxc5 {But she doesn't give him a chance!} Be7 {He finally develops his bishop.} 16. Bb2 {and so does she - and it has a lovely diagonal to g7.} O-O {He castles.} 17. Nd2 {She develops.} Rab8 {He attacks b4 for a second time, so it needs protecting.} 18. a3 {Which she does.} a5 {He correctly attacks it again.} 19. Qg4 {And she correctly threatens mate.} g6 {A necesarry weakening of his king position.} 20. Qe4 {With a threat. Fritz prefers Rf-e1} axb4 {Black takes.} 21. Be5 {White carries out her threat and wins the exchange.} Qxc5 {But black is getting two pawns for it.} 22. Bxb8 {White takes.} Rxb8 {Black takes back.} 23. axb4 {White takes.} Rxb4 {Black takes back.} 24. Ra8+ {White throws in a check before moving her queen.} Kg7 {King comes up.} 25. Qe5+ {Another check} Bf6 {Black blocks} 26. Ne4 {This is actually a mistake by white. Black could now have got a second pawn for the exchange with 26....Qxf2+ and then after white takes the black queen black takes the white queen with Bxe5. Fritz says that black would then have a small edge.} Qc6 {But luckily for Hiya black doesn't spot that.} 27. Nxf6 {Excellent play by white. Black will now have a powerful pin on the Nf6.} Nxf6 {Black takes back.} 28. Rfa1 {Another strong move, doubling on the a file.} Re4 {Fritz actually prefers 28...Qe4 or 28....Qd5 although I can see the logic in black keeping the queens on the board - normally when material down, as black is, one avoids an exchange of queens if you can. White can't keep the pin on the Nf6 now, as if 29. Qb2? e5 but she has something better - threaten mate!} 29. Qb8 Ng4 {Fritz prefers 29....g5 (with white at plus 1.69) or 29....Nd7 (with white at plus 2.91)} 30. Qh8+ {White drives the black king up the board, and gives the position as plus 3.63 to white. Fritz prefers 30. Qf8+ with plus 5.44} Kh6 {Forced! } 31. Qf8+ {White correctly drives the black king up the board again.} Kg5 {According to Fritz the better of the two options black had. Fritz gives it as plus 3.59 to white, but plus 4.56 after Kh5.} 32. h4+ {A pawn gets in on the action! Fritz is not a fan of this move, preferring simply 32. Qxf7 (plus 3.66)} Kf6 {This looks logical as now the king is protecting the f7 pawn, but it turns out that the pawn can't be protected anyway, so Fritz prefers 32...Kh5 (plus 3.03) With the king on f6 Fritz gives it as plus 5.62} 33. Qd8+ {Nicely played by white.} Kg7 34. Qh8+ {Another check} Kh6 {Forced!} 35. Qf8+ {Another check} Kh5 {Forced again.} 36. Qxf7 {And the f pawn finally drops, and there is a threat to the h pawn.} Qc3 {I think black is planning his own little attack with Re4-e1+ but it is not as strong as white's attack. Fritz prefers 36....h6 with plus 3.22 to white.} 37. Qxh7+ {Now the h pawn goes with check} Nh6 {Forced!} 38. Ra8a5+ {Another check} e5 {Blocked} 39. Ra5a6 {And now a mate threat.} Re1+ {Black finally gets his own check in} 40. Kg2 {King up the board. } Qd3 {Clever move by black. Black protects g6 and also prepares to meet Ra1xRe1 with QxRa6} 41. Rxe1 {White takes anyway} Qxa6 {Black recaptures} 42. Rxe5+ {Another check} Kg4 43. f3# {And finally the mate. Many thanks for reading. I think both players played extremely maturely for their ages, and both are names to keep an eye on! Please rate the annotation with the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am getting on. Until next time dear reader!}
