1. e4 {This game is an instructive one in the sense that it features a simple king + pawn vs king ending.   Ideas applied   how to win KPvsK endgames  1. Gain opposition 2. Advance pawn to the 2nd last rank 3. force zugwig 4. promote pawn} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {I have been playing the sicilian more lately but I still prefer kings indian games. } cxd4 4. Nxd4 e6 {one of the strengths of sicilian from black's point of view is that he can setup a meriad of pawn structures to suit his style of play. Here I am aiming for a hedgehog formation with pawns on e6, d6 and a6.} 5. Nc3 Nf6 {I played this to test white and see what kind of mood he was in. If he follows up with g4 then I know he wants to fight. } 6. Be2 {A solid line but this move does not give black too much trouble. In fact it allows black to achieve his openning objectives unmalested. } d6 7. O-O Be7 8. Be3 {putting the bishop on e3 instead of G5 is becoming very fashionable lately. It is easy to understand why because on g5 the bishop get harassed and white has not really gotten any serious advantage from it. Plus the bishop on e3 is actually more flexible than on g5. From here it eyes the d4 square and can assist with queenside attacking stratagies. } Bd7 9. Ndb5 {an exicting idea but a bit too aggressive. The forced move for black Qb8 is actually not to bad because the queen is well position on the b8-h2 diagonal and can support pawn thrusts from safety. The disadvantage of Qb8 is that the A rook is going to be hard to develop. } Qb8 10. a3 {The gameknot database overwhelmingly favors this position for black. If there is an improvement on this line it is here. Something like 10. a4} O-O {planning to deal with the knight on b5 but first I take care of defense. } 11. Qd2 {As white I would be expecting 11. ...a6 but the problem is how do you get an advantage out of it?  11. f4 a6 12. Nd4 h6 13. Qd2 and black has 13. ...Nxd4= 13. ...b5 13. ...Qc7 as options 11. Nd4 a6 12. f4 h6 12. Qd2 =} a6 {the problem of 10.a3 is now evident. Normally white can retreat his knight to a3 in order to avoid teh exchange and to reorganize via b1 or c4. } 12. Nd4 Ne5 {both ...Nxd4 and 12. ...e5 create a serious weakness on d6 } 13. f4 Neg4 {my position is a bit cramped so the exchagne of pieces is in order} 14. h3 Nxe3 15. Qxe3 {As a result of the exchange white's centre has been weakened. However, my main problem is my lack of mobilty so I have to open the game up further to increase my advantage of the bishop pair. Plus white's king pawns are starting to look dangerous.} e5 {saddling white with a isolated e4 pawn } 16. fxe5 dxe5 17. Nf5 Bxf5 18. Rxf5 Qc8 {controling c5 which threatens Bc5 with a deadly pin. In a short few moves black has greatly improved his prospects. Black's pieces enjoys a greater sense of harmony} 19. Rxe5 {defends against Bc5 and gains the pawn but blacks well coordinated pieces more than compensate for the pawn} Bd6 20. Rg5 Re8 {the idea of attacking an isolated pawn is simple. Control the square immedaitely infront of it. } 21. Rxg7+ {?? This is suicide there is no way white has a winning attack here. In fact he is out gunned} Kxg7 22. Qg5+ {in order to win here white need the support of either his rook or knight. But neither is capable of adding support} Kf8 23. Qxf6 {I am not sure how far my opponant saw but he is busted. You cant win with a lone queen} Qc5+ {when everything else is equal piece position trumps everything. I have patterned my chess after Karpov and I am in awe with how he has this knack of pieces being down a pawn and still winning because of he piece placement.   Peterosin also followed this rule of piece placement. in many of his games he slowly squeezed the life out of his opponent by simply maximizing the influence of his pieces and controlling the centre. } 24. Kf1 Be5 {all my pieces with the exception of my A rook are centralized and attacking something. } 25. Qf5 Re6 {simply threatening ...Rf6 winning the queen} 26. Nd5 {plugging up the centre and preventing Rf6 with nasty stuff happening. } Bxb2 27. Re1 {rook belong on open filies so Rd1 is better} Kg7 28. c3 b5 {taking space away from the LSB} 29. Rd1 Bxc3 30. Rc1 Qxa3 31. Rxc3 Qxc3 {forces the exchange of queens and gives a winning advantage to black because of the mobility of his queen pawns} 32. Nxc3 Rf6 33. Nd5 Rxf5+ 34. exf5 Rc8 35. f6+ {The irony of this move is that this limits the mobility of the knight. } Kf8 36. Ke1 Rc5 37. Ne3 a5 38. Kd2 b4 39. Bd1 Rc6 40. Nd5 Rd6 41. Bf3 a4 42. Kc2 Rc6+ 43. Kb1 a3 {putting the pawns on the dark squares out of the range of the LSB} 44. Bd1 Rc4 {Threatening to fork the minor pieces} 45. Nb6 Rd4 46. Bb3 Rd2 47. Ka1 Rxg2 48. Nd7+ Ke8 49. Ne5 Rg5 50. Nd3 Rg3 51. Ba4+ Kf8 52. Nxb4 Rxh3 53. Ka2 h5 54. Bc6 h4 55. Bb7 Rg3 56. Nc2 Rg6 57. Nxa3 h3 58. Kb3 h2 59. Kc2 Rxf6 60. Nc4 Rf1 61. Ne3 h1=Q 62. Bxh1 Rxh1 63. Nd5 f5 64. Nf4 Kf7 65. Kd2 Kf6 66. Ke2 Rh2+ 67. Kf3 Ra2 68. Nd3 Ra3 69. Ke2 Rxd3 70. Kxd3 {how to win KPvsK endgames  1. Gain opposition 2. Advance pawn to the 2nd last rank 3. force zugwig 4. promote pawn} Kg5 71. Kd2 Kf4 72. Ke2 Kg3 73. Kf1 Kf3 {Opposition gained} 74. Kg1 f4 {Advancing pawn} 75. Kf1 Ke3 76. Ke1 f3 77. Kf1 f2 {focing zugwig for the win}
