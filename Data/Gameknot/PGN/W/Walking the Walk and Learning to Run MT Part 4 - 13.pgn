1. e4 d5 {At the moment I always chose the scandnavian.} 2. e5 {It's not my favorite variation;} Nc6 3. d4 Bf5 4. c3 Qd7 5. Bd3 Bxd3 6. Qxd3 O-O-O 7. Nf3 f6 8. Be3 Kb8 {To protect the king but may be a failure, giving white one tempo.} 9. Nbd2 fxe5 10. dxe5 e6 11. Nb3 Nge7 {The position didn't suit me. It' rather equilibrated but black is stronger in the center, black has a lack of mobility and the black bishop is blocked on f8} 12. Nc5 {White attacks} Qc8 {to protect b2 and c2} 13. Bd4 h6 {to prevent Ng5} 14. b4 {white's attack preoccupates me and my plan to stop it is to trade both knights and the bishops} Re8 {To protect e3 so that the e knight can move on f5 to attack the bishop} 15. a4 {White carries on attacking} Nf5 {I hope my plan will work} 16. O-O Nfxd4 {Let's go for trading ! No pieces, no attack.} 17. Nxd4 Nxd4 18. Qxd4 Bxc5 {N} 19. bxc5 c6 {At this point I felt relief. The danger seemed passed and I was quite satisfied of myself. The b open file is still dangerous for black but white's pawn structure is far inferior. If I can trade the pieces, the game's end is for black.} 20. Rfb1 {That had to come.} Re7 {Black has material enough to protect himself} 21. Rb2 Rf8 {To be able to double the rooks on f file or 7 line} 22. Rab1 Ref7 {The queen and the f7 tower seemed sufficient protection  even in case of 23 Qb4, so I decided to double the towers on the file to prepare a counterattack. It's probably the losing move because I didnt car of c3} 23. Qb4 Qc7 {This move was foreplanned and seemed ok to me : protection of b2, menace on e5, aiming at a4} 24. a5 Ka8 {My protection still seemed sufficient. I still had the idea to trade as many major pieces as possible.} 25. a6 bxa6 {It still seemed ok to me, dangerous but I thought I would stop the attack} 26. Qa3 Qxe5 {The pawn trading seemed ok, anyway I couldn't prvent white to take in a3} 27. Qxa6 {At this point, I saw the problem in c3 but it was too late} Qc7 {I had no other choice} 28. Rb2b7 Qxb7 29. Rxb7 Rxb7 {As for material black'still allright and can double the towers but c3...} 30. Qxc6 Rfb8 {Last chance !} 31. g3 {I could have submited here but wanted to see a bit further how black could defend} Rf8 32. Qxe6 Rf6 33. Qg8+ Rb8 34. Qxd5+ Rb7 35. c6 Rb1+ 36. Kg2 Rf8 37. c7+ {Well done Theanalogikid ! Your attack was clean.}
