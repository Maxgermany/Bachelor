1. e4 c5 {This started as a Sicilian.  White to play.} 2. c3 {White plays the Alapin Variation.} e6 3. d4 d5 4. e5 {Transposes to the Advance Variation of the French Defense.} Nc6 5. Nf3 cxd4 {Not technically the best, because it opens up the c3 square for the White knight.  Better is 5... Qb6.} 6. cxd4 Bb4+ {This check is not particularly good, because it will likely trade his good bishop.  It is either that or waste time moving it again.} 7. Bd2 Qb6 8. Be2 {White was familiar with this position and knew that the d4 pawn is poisoned.} Nxd4 {Black takes the bait.} 9. Nxd4 Qxd4 10. Qa4+ {Black loses a piece.} Bd7 11. Qxb4 Qxe5 12. Nc3 {White made this move with the hope of catching his opponent in another trap.} d4 {Black thinks that he can win a piece.} 13. Nb5 d3 {Black falls for the trap.  According to Alan, at this point his opponent looked smug.} 14. Nd6+ {Now Black can't avoid losing his queen.} Qxd6 15. Qxd6 dxe2 {Black gets what he wanted, but the price was too high.  White to play.} 16. Bb4 {Threatening mate.} Kd8 17. Qf8+ {It is technically faster to play 17. Rc1 Rc8 18. Kxe2 Rc6 19. Rxc6 bxc6 20. Qb8+ Bc8 21. Rd1+ Ke8 22. Qxc8#.} Kc7 {Here White took the rook and eventually won, but it seemed to me that he could do better...} 18. Rc1+ Bc6 19. Qd6+ {If 19... Kc8 20. Ba5 b6 21. Rxc6+ Kb7 22. Rxb6+ axb6 23. Qxb6+ Kc8 24. Qc7#.  If 22... Kc8 23. Rb8+ Rxb8 24. Qc7#.} Kb6 {Mate in 5.} 20. Qe5 a5 {Mate in 4.} 21. Bc5+ {If 21... Kb5 22. Qxe2+.} Ka6 {Mate in 3.} 22. Qc7 Kb5 23. Qb6+ {With three different ways to mate on the next move.}
