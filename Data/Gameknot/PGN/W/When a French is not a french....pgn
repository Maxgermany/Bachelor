[Opening "French (C00), Steinitz attack"]

1. e4 {E4. My favorite.} e6 {Black chooses the French Defense with e6.} 2. e5 {I decide to take him out of book, and test his knowledge. Of COURSE this isn't the best move. Played intentionally, however.} d6 {My opponent chooses the correct response...} 3. exd6 {And I decide to not let things transpose back into the french, and trade off the pawn. This of course gives away most of white's advantage of moving first, but I still retain the initiative, so I often don't mind doing this just to not follow known book lines, although no doubt the position ends up in some known line. There's only so many chess moves in the opening one can do after all that don't give the game away.} Bxd6 {Again, the strongest reply. Black seems to be playing very well so far, and me? Ha ha ha! Well, that's what chess IS to me: fun. Is this still a French? What is this now? I really don't know, but I don't think it's a French, even though Black still has a structure that seems like one. At any rate, now it's time for white to begin to play in earnest...} 4. Nf3 {Not the recommended move order by Fritz. Fritz prefers I move my d pawn or white bishop out before the knight. Not sure this move order is so significant at this point, however.} Nc6 {Fritz liked Nd7 better, and an eventual fianchetto of black's light-squared bishop. This should be considered an inaccuracy by black that might have implications later in the game.} 5. d4 {So I choose the best reply here. D4.} Bd7 {Again Fritz preferred another move, Nf6. Seems black has been a bit lulled by my odd play earlier in the opening and does not have a plan as a result. To be honest, nor do I at this point. The game is going to end up, just looking at the pieces, as an open game; and it's hard to have a plan without seeing how the pawn structure will end up. Notice, however, that black does have structure to his pawns; hence Fritz's disagreements earlier to black's moves. I however am still not sure at all what to do, so my plans will wait until I can see something more clearly. That's what I like most about chess; the ability to create plans from a position where none may be apparent to those of us who enjoy chess more as a hobby.} 6. a3 {I choose a waiting move. Fritz preferred a bishop move by me here, but I'm not so sure where my bishops should go yet. Some may say it's a wasted move, but I am also preparing a future b4 here, as my play will be on the queenside most likely. Oh, that's the other problem with being out of book; known openings have known strategies while only at move 6, as here in this game. Now this a pawn move by me is easily countered by black with say, a5, if he were to choose to do that. The game is pretty equal here, and although I like black's pawns, I don't like his piece position so much.} Nf6 {Fritz did not like this move either, preferring to add tension to the center with e5, and open up the board for his bishops, which pieces could suddenly be much better by so doing. Black, however, wishes to get his king to safety, hence the night move.} 7. Bg5 {Now here Fritz wanted me to move Be2, or my other knight out. This move wastes a tempo, but after black's response, I'll have a better idea of what I should plan... i.e., will he move h6 or move the bishop? Since it pretty much does waste a move, Fritz is not too impressed with this move, giving black a small advantage.} Be7 {And Fritz thinks this is not the best reply. H6 or castling was Fritz' choice here, but the game is still basically equal, slight advantage now for white.} 8. Bd3 {I choose the best continuation here according to Fritz. Black's pieces look very symmetrical, although not sure that e pawn should be sitting on e6 for long.} O-O {Black chooses to castle....} 9. O-O {And I also castle; again the best response according to Fritz at this point.} Nd5 {And Black makes the natural looking move Nd5, a top pick of Fritz.} 10. Bd2 {Fritz seemed to like trading the bishops off, but I'm not quite ready to do that. So I go ahead and retreat to d2; white still has a small advantage. I like, however, at this point, my potential mobility better than black's.} f5 {Black chooses the aggressive f5, but I don't think this is good; black's king defense is weakened, and the white bishop remains very passive. It's not clear where the black knights should go - d5 won't be an outpost for too long, and a knight on g4 is easily chased away. And although it's early in the game, black is beginning to look uncoordinated to me.} 11. c4 {I am beginning to formulate a plan. I am going to want to have my knight on c3, but I don't want black to have the option of trading those pieces off, when I think I am better positioned for mobility. Since I am planning now on a queenside push, while positioning a second threat at the kingside, this move to me is a better fit. It was also Fritz's second choice. Silly Fritz. ;)} Nf6 {Nb6 or Nf6; black chooses Nf6. Meanwhile, I am beginning to like my position.} 12. Nc3 {Well Fritz preferred a queen or rook move here, considering this an inaccuracy. But I am exercising my plan, and it called for this knight move. So far, 25 moves in, neither side has made a major strategical or tactical mistake, unless you call my strange moves to start the game such. ;) I believe and Fritz agrees that white has a slight edge.} Kh8 {This is a prophylactic move by black, to get his king off the a2-g8 diagonal. Fritz doesn't like it at all. But I can see why black wanted to make this move now. There is a continuation to remove one of my bishops for a knight here, but black chose not to try it. After some thought...} 13. Kh1 {I do the same for similar reasons. And Fritz thinks there are better ones. But it's the kind of move that saves a position down the road often enough. White is retaining an edge still.} Rg8 {THIS move I did not like by black. In order to pull off what he seems to be trying to do, he's gunna need to push that g pawn, and that will leave his king rather vulnerable. Although he has his forces mostly positioned to help things over there, they don't have all that much room to maneuver. Fritz agrees; this is not a good move for black.From this point on, I think white slowly gains the clear upper hand.} 14. b4 {Fritz preferred d5 or Qc2; but I'm interested in pushing that queenside. Moving one of those other two could result in winning a pawn according to Fritz and the pressure on black's king would go up, especially with the white light-squared bishop getting to a2-g8 diagonal. But this is not a bad move either.} Qf8 {Fritz is really disliking black's strategy now, giving a plus to white of about 1 1/2. Bottling that one rook up is a bad idea in general too.} 15. b5 {I choose the best move: b5.} Nd8 {Black chooses the lesser of two evils. Now yes, I am hanging the a pawn, but black won't have time to make that a game-changer!} 16. Ne5 {Fritz likes c5 or a4 here. This move however allows me, if I choose, to cause black to either give up the bishop pair or for at least a few more moves, remain even more cramped. When I play, I do not always play for an immediate advantage or tactical edge. I often look at what I am trying to accomplish, and then position to make that a reality; if my plan is the better plan of the two, then normally things go well!} c6 {Fritz liked c5 better.} 17. Nxd7 {Well, Fritz didn't like this, but now black does not have the bishop pair. Black is so oddly positioned that I could have done a couple other things; allowed Nf7 and played Re1 after which the e pawn would have become a target is one such thing. However, I felt that I needn't fight just for that one pawn, and thought that later in the game, black's not having the bishop pair would put him in difficulties. You can decide that for yourself. While the knight WAS worth more than that bishop just now, I did not see a way to make that work to my advantage, and that particular advantage would not remain later...} Nxd7 {The obvious reply.} 18. d5 {Fritz still dislikes this series by white.} e5 {Fritz isn't liking what either of us have been doing. But we're both working our unique plans, not just going after the .5 swing these moves are causing!} 19. dxc6 {Here I happen to choose a move that makes Fritz happy. Black has to reply.} bxc6 {Be3 was possible, but for my upcoming move, I preferred Qh5...} 20. Qh5 {Now white is launching a serious attack. Pushing on the Queenside gave me mobility and restricted black's, and now I can suddenly mount threats on the kingside too. Black is totally passive. Yes, I'm still hanging the 'a' pawn, lol. But I have bigger fish to fry than saving the lowly peasant, alas. ;)} g6 {Black responds with Frit'z best choice.} 21. Qh3 {I respond with Frit'z top choice of moves. Although my Queen is a bit out of position just now, I have succeeded in really loosening up the black King's defenses. Time for a quick regroup, and continue with the attack!} cxb5 {Taking the a pawn was still possible, but black is trying to free up his position... I just don't think he can do so safely at this point; and this allows my bishop to easily get to c4. But what else could black do here? } 22. cxb5 {Retakes. And now, Fritz thinks there are better things for black to do than take that a pawn.} Ne6 23. Bc4 {Ratcheting up the pressure... and at this point of the game, black finally has no good reply now, cramped positionally and with little king safety. This position is definitely winning for white now, and Fritz agrees.} Nf4 {Black is willing to give up the exchange, but white still has a winning game. The continuation is a no-brainer...} 24. Bxf4 exf4 25. Bxg8 Kxg8 {Not a huge difference which piece recaptures. It's an easy white win, although my opponent dislikes losing to an 'unrated' opponent, and plays on a bit longer.} 26. Nd5 {The best move.} Bd6 {And... the best move. Suddenly, the best moves are easier to spot!} 27. a4 {Rad1 was the best move, and I thought about it. Connecting the pawns is not bad either, and I choose to do that.} Qf7 {This move hangs the black rook, allowing white to win a pawn by Nxf4. (...Bxf4 Qf3!) But Fritz likes Rad1 better, and so did I.} 28. Rad1 Be5 29. Qh6 {Now at this point of the game, I no longer played sharply; the position is won for white, and I lose interest. Better would have been Nb4 or Rfe1. I just want to trade pieces now, and that is what this move was for.} Nf6 {Nc5 or Nb6 was much better. This move prevents the loss of the pawn for a while, but further's white's advantage by allowing the trade.} 30. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {Much better was taking with the bishop, but it doesn't really matter anyways.} 31. Rd7 Qh8 {Bd4 or Re8 were much better. But it's not so easy to see in a Blitz game when one's king is under that much pressure. With the last few moves, black has sealed his fate.} 32. Rfd1 Bf6 {A momentary respite. So I'll reposition the queen with benefits...} 33. Qxf4 Re8 {And now something has to give. Unfortunately a quick mate is now possible.} 34. Qc4+ Kf8 {And Qf7 is mate. I was so bored and playing so quickly in this Blitz game (read: sloppily, shame on me) I simply moved Rf7, then realized I had a mate, and would have to move the rook again and move the queen. But after that last move, Black finally resigned.} 35. Rf7+ {Mate in two which should have already been mate. In retrospect, I think black went wrong way back when he positioned his one bishop poorly instead of fianchettoing it. The cramped black position, and open King's defenses contributed to white's success here many moves later. You know, I find strong players sometimes fall into the trap of playing unrated opponents a bit more loosely than perhaps they should; mobility, space, king protection: these are all basic parts of the game, and cannot be forgotten no matter who one's opponent is. Hope you enjoyed it!}
