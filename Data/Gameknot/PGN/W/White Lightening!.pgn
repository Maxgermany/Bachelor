1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Ardin (Sonata) was trying to get his revenge against me for his defeat in the Allgaier Gambit.  Ardin plays a good solid game until something happens and he loses the exchange.  After this I spend a lot of time contemplating just how I am gonna convert this advantage into a victory.  Then, I had a lightbulb moment and unfortunately for Ardin, he was hit by a Glenda generated bolt of white lightening!  So, how does this happen, well read on.} g6 {1. ..... g6 - the Robatsch Defense - black plays a hyper-modern opening.} 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 c6 4. Nf3 {4. Nf3 - so, I as white have a good pawn centre and my two knights are on their best squares - but can I convert this into a real advantage? We shall see.} d5 5. h3 e6 6. Bd3 Ne7 7. O-O {7. 0-0 - both sides continue to develop and I tuck Henry away on the kingside.} dxe4 8. Bxe4 {8. bxe4 - pawn trade.} Nd7 9. Be3 Nf6 10. Bd3 Ned5 11. Nxd5 cxd5 {11. .... cxd5 knight trade.} 12. c3 O-O 13. Qc1 {13. Qc1 - preparing a move such as Bh6.} Ne4 14. Qc2 f5 15. Bf4 {15. Bf4 - not much doing at the moment and black's knight looks pretty strong.} h6 16. Be5 Bxe5 17. Nxe5 {17. Nxe5 - I do manage to trade off the two dark square bishops and manage a tit for tat knight placement on e5.  Black's castled position looks a little draughty though but can I take advantage of this?  Again, only time will tell.} Qf6 {17. ..... Qf6 - if only there wasn't a black light square bishop controlling d7!} 18. Bb5 Qg5 19. f4 {19. f4 - Aha, the Wicked Witch of the West decides to come into my pos, does she?!  Well, I think I can put in a Witch Ejection Plan here.  Luckily my f4 pawn is defended by my f1 rook.} Qg3 {19. .... Qg3? - this move is gonna drop the exchange in two turns, just wait for it .....} 20. Rf3 {20. Rf3 ....... wait for it ......} Qh4 21. Nxg6 {21. Nxg6 - ...... NOW!!!  ..... So my knight gets a bun and the hap penny too!  Not only does he fork the Witch and the Rook on f8, because of Ardin's draughty kingside, he also steels a pawn into the bargain - nice and double nice!} Qf6 22. Nxf8 Kxf8 {22. ..... Kf8 - my steed is finally expunged by the BK but he has had his fill.  Now, I think the next plan is to exchange Fou Leblanc for black's knight on e4.  It is stopping a WR from getting to g3 so, as loathe to part with Fou Leblanc as I am, I think it is the best plan here.} 23. Bd3 b6 24. Raf1 Bb7 25. Bxe4 dxe4 26. Rg3 {26. Rg3 - I did delay the exchange of B for N because black's move gave me time to move another rook to the f file to defend my f pawn should there be a lot of heavy piece activity.} Kf7 27. Qa4 {27. Qa4 - Glenda can be a very sneaky, stealthy queen at times.  A lot of the time she is defending pieces, hence her title Glenda the Defender, but here she will soon be Glenda the Offender!} Bc8 {27. ..... Bc8?? - in the chat, Ardin told me that he intended to make me work for my victory.  I thought, he was absolutely right.  Then I got my lightening moment.  I realised that Glenda could now plonk herself on c6, threatening Ardin's rook.  In fact, looking even more closely, that rook cannot be saved due to a queen fork on c7 if the rook moves to b8.  I then made that move.  Ardin sees that he will be 8 points down on material two moves down the line and so, on the grounds of ruinous loss of material he decided to resign! Commiserations Ardin and good luck in your other games!  Kind regards - Joanne} 28. Qc6 {}
