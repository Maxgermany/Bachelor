1. d4 {I opened d3.   } Nf6 {Black opens bringing out his kingside Knight. } 2. c4 {I bring out another pawn in hopes to controlling the center. This is considered book.} e5 {Black plays book and is attacking my pawn} 3. dxe5 {I take his pawn and am now attacking his knight. This is book. This is my third move and I have not developed a minor piece. Playing too many pawn moves could end up getting me doubled pawns in an exchange. So far I feel I have played book and am up a pawn.} Ne4 {Black has to move his Knight again due my pawn.} 4. Nc3 {I develop my first minor piece. } Nxc3 {Knight takes Knight.  } 5. bxc3 {I  retake the knight with my pawn and now have doubled pawns and a pawn on e5 that is unprotected. With this move I still have  all my pawns, neither of us have developed minor pieces. } Bc5 {Black has developed his DSB and it has a nice look at my f2 pawn.} 6. e3 {I play yet another pawn to e3 thinking this will protect me from the DSB. This is not the best move I could of played something better, developing a minor piece would have been better.  } Nc6 {Black develops a Knight. I don't think he was too worried in castling just yet. Plus this way he attacks my unprotected hanging e5 pawn} 7. Nf3 {I develop my Knight to protect my center pawn. I was about to f4 to protect the pawn, Could that of been a better move?} O-O {Now Black castles kingside. } 8. Bd3 {I bring out my LSB as far as it can go. My pawns on the c-file are doubled up and I am wondering if I will ever get  to move them in this game.   } Qe7 {Black's Queen peeks out to e7.} 9. Be4 {I have moved my LSB again. I wanted to develop my DSB but it had only 1 move. I think castling here would have been a better move.} Nxe5 {Knight takes pawn.} 10. Qd5 {I decide it's time to introduce my Queen into the game. A better move was to exchange Knight's.} d6 {d6  protects the Knight.} 11. Nxe5 dxe5 12. Bb2 { I moved the wrong bishop. Blunder: -5.27 » 12. Bb2 Rd8 13. Bxh7+ Kxh7 14. Qe4+ g6 15. O-O Bf5 16.

Rxd1} Rd8 {Rook to d-file attacking my Queen.} 13. Bxh7+ { Bxh7+ I decide to put Black in check with my LSB. At least if black takes with his King. I can move my Queen out of danger. } Kxh7 { } 14. Qe4+ {Qe4+ weak check, but able to move my Queen from attack.} f5 15. Qc2 {I retreat my Queen  pinned is the f5 pawn for now.} Be6 {Black develops LSB.} 16. Rd1 {move my Rook next to my King. } Rxd1+ { Rxd1+ Rook takes Rook. } 17. Kxd1 {King takes rook, I decided not to take with my Queen thinking I would make my King safer Queen side.  } Qg5 {Black brings out his Queen as a defender. } 18. g3 Bxc4 19. f4 {Blunder: -10.84 » 19. f4 Qg4+ 20.
