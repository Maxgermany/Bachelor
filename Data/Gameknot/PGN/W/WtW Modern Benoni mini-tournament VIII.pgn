1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. h3 Bg7 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Nf3 a6 10. a4 {preventing the anoyimoveng b5 } Re8 {rook on the semi-open file} 11. O-O {king in safe} Nh5 {I'm not sure about this move : it opens the diagonal giving efficiency to the DSB but is a call for a further g4 and second move for an already developped piece. On the other hand it covers the f4 square, a weak point in white's position.} 12. Bg5 {bold reaction to black's last move.} Bf6 {The DSB leaves his lair} 13. Be3 Nd7 {developping move. } 14. Re1 {I see nothing better. Until now both players play very prudently (we had a lot of benoni together before this game...)} Rb8 {To prepare an attack on the queenside} 15. Qd2 {Joining the rooks and preparing a kingside attack} Bg7 {The DSB is back in his lair} 16. g4 {White has developpement advance and control more space. I estimate that some risk is ok. The aim is an attack on d6} Nhf6 17. Bf4 {Attacking the unprotected d pawn.} Ne5 {Knight on the center.... defensive and offensive move (menacing a fork attack by 18. ... Nxf3+)} 18. Nxe5 {trading} dxe5 {Black has no choice.} 19. Bg5 {pinning the knight} Qc7 {unpinning the knight.  At this point, I see a possible tactic.} 20. Bc4 {preparing a further d6, blocking the c pawn, pinning the f pawn.} Bd7 {To join the rooks. The LSB has no other proper place to go. More dangerous : it menaces 21. ... b5} 21. Ba2 {To prevent the main menace if 21. ... b5 and keep white's plan on the center available.} b5 {Black launches his attack on the queenside} 22. d6 {"The best defense is attack"} Qb6 {Qc8 would probably have been better} 23. Bxf6 {Preparing the next move.} Bxf6 {Black has little other choice} 24. Nd5 {Fork attack between b6 and f6} Qxd6 {Only move to save f6} 25. Nxf6+ {Black has only one move available} Qxf6 {No alternative} 26. Qxd7 {Now white is ahead in material but has serious positionnal weaknesses (3 unprotected pawns and a weak king) which  black, undoubtedly will try to exploit.} Rbd8 {Obvious move} 27. Qc7 {There were few alterbatives (27. Qb7 is death because of 27. ... Re7). 27. Qa7 gives the same result than 27. Qc7} Rd2 28. Qxc5 {Protecting the vital f pawn} Rxb2 29. Bd5 {Closing the open file and protecting the e pawn at little risk because black has no more pawns available to fire the bishop.} b4 30. Ra2 Rxa2 31. Bxa2 Rb8 32. Rb1 Qf4 33. Rxb4 Rxb4 34. Qxb4 Kg7 35. Bd5 h5 36. Qe7 hxg4 37. Qh4 Qc1+ 38. Kg2 gxh3+ 39. Qxh3 Qg5+ 40. Qg3 Qxg3+ 41. Kxg3 Kf6 42. Kg4 a5 43. f3 {I hesitated between several possibilities (43.f4 ; 43. Bc6). I finally elected this one because there is still a risk of draw and I wanted to try to take a free pawn without exchanging.} Kg7 44. Kg5 f6+ 45. Kg4 Kf8 46. f4 Ke7 47. fxe5 fxe5 48. Kg5 Kd6 49. Kxg6 Kc5 50. Kf5 Kb4 51. Bc6 Kc5 52. Bb5 Kd4 53. Be8 Kc5 {}
