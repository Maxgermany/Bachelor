[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C67), Berlin defence, open variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {I didn't know what to do if after 1...e5, he played 2.f4.  But, I would've started by accepting the gambit since that's what reversion in our third game.} Nf6 {Since, however, he played the Ruy Lopez, I'll answer with what I'm most comfortable doing which is the Berlin Defense.  Afterall, "Stick with what you Know." is effective but especially against this runner.} 4. O-O {Not to my surprise, he castles.} Nxe4 {And, I take due what I've studied with cplusplus11 in a game against Jack Stockel.  Later on, I studied the same thing in my first game with reversion.  It boils down to one thing which is that I'm staying in book for the same reason mentioned a move earlier. } 5. Re1 {Still in book.} d5 {But, this is where I deviate and try something different.  The most common move is to retreat back.  Generally speaking, I'd answer with 5...Nf3  But, this is the strongest opponent that I've been playing against.  So, I'm not messing around.  Instead of retreating, I decide to defend with my pawn and treat it, as though, it were the Philidor's Defense, even though, it's something different.  The idea, in this context, was preventing the loss of tempo since I don't want to be bothered going back to the original square that I started off.  Also, if I moved back, 6.Nxe5 becomes available right away.  So, I thought that I was preventing Terence from getting my N back until the next move.} 6. d3 Nc5 {Knowing that, it was a question of where to retreat.  I wanted to play 6...Nf6 but thought that this square gave my N a better outpost.  Turns out that it doesn't, but the main reason behind playing this, however, is that I enjoy having both my N's close together.  Plus, they're towards the center, and coordinating your pieces near that area gives you better center control, as I learned (some time ago) from Susan Polgar.} 7. Nxe5 Be7 {?? This, however, is the terrible blunder.  Unlike my game with albertwall, I made a very similar blunder that happened with bhidragon, and it's quite bad.  Yes, I went back to the chess bits and wisdom, as opposed to, thinking about how the games developing.  My hyperfocus was on continuing with development and trying to control the center.  I knew that my Nc6, but forgot that it happened twice.  I was thinking along the lines that if he took, I'd take back.  And, it's that simple, after what happened in our first where I got too nervous.  This time, the opposite happened, as now, despite not being pompous, I was, most certainly overly confident.  However, it also boils down to the same mistake that I made with reversion in our second game.  With the N being attacked two times, Terence will get a pawn+piece without compensation.  Since my Nc6 is pinned, better was 7...a6 to for a defender.  But, I don't know how much that would help, after the next move, anyhow.  Better then what I mentioned (so best) was to break the pin with 7...Bd7, which is the most common way to break that pin.  And, if he takes I would've had an answer to that.  It might have meant exchanging pieces, and possibly losing a pawn, but it's much better then what happens being that and piece, without compensation this early.} 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. Nxc6 Qd6 10. Nxe7 {At first, I thought that it wasn't a free piece.  But, due to his Re1, it is.  This is why it was better to stop this threat by breaking the pin, at once.} Be6 {Knowing what's unfolded and given that I can't castle short but also bearing in mind that the Queen is out, my focus becomes castling long or opposite wings of elyhim.  I remembered two past games where my opponent castled on opposite sides with good results.  In those instances, when I castled short, the opponent would castle long and would end up with good results.  The difference, in this case, however, is that I'm behind.  But, since I'm following the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules, I'll try that method of castling on opposite wings, anyhow.} 11. Nf5 {But, he has a threat that must be answered first.  Due to my Be6 being pinned, I can't take.} Qf8 {And, knowing that I can't castle short, as noted, I just retreat here.  I also bear in mind that anything loses my Queen or g7 pawn, so why not defend both?} 12. Nc3 {Continuing his development.} O-O-O {And, as noted, I castle on the opposite wing.  Another reason for doing this isn't just because it was used against me.  But, there is a bigger story.  With the pin, his Nf5, and Re1, Terence was threatening to win my Be6.  By castling, however, that threat is gone, as now, I can protect it.} 13. Nd4 {With that being said, his N was under attack, and thus, needed to defend it.} Bd7 {And, I use that time to avoid further liquidation.  The bad part is that he is going to win another pawn.} 14. Nxd5 Be8 {Just like with Knights, my plan was to get my Bishop to a better outpost.  The plan involves 15...f6, and then 16...Bf7, or 16...Bg5.  I think it would've been g5 since I like bringing them to good spots, and I am thinking of strategy, similar to what Susan Polgar emphasized with the Knights which you saw in one of her games and an OTB WTW Game against Bernie.} 15. Ne7+ {But, he stops that with this move.} Kb7 {I also could've answered with 15...Kd7, but it would've just been for the thrills and giggles of a one move attack.  It's pointless due to his Re1 protecting Ne7.  In addition, this would restrict the mobility of my Rd8, and as we know, mobility is vital.} 16. Qf3+ {Not surprised to see Terence play this.} Ka6 {And, this is how I was going to answer, anyway.} 17. Ndc6 {Attacking my Rd8, which I overlooked.  } f6 {?? This is where I thought it was safe to follow up on that plan, overlooking my Rd8 being under attack.  In doing that, he gets a Rook.  Although I don't enjoy liquidating here, the only move that would've stopped this was 17...Bxc6.  The other move that it appears to work (17...Ra8) fails due to his discovered with 18.Nb4+  Afterwhich, he still gets the Rook.} 18. Nxd8 Bd7 {?? With Ne7+Nd8, I can't get my LSB to the square that I desired.  So, I bring it here.  But, I overlooked what's coming which is mate.} 19. Re6+ Ka5 20. Nb7+ Nxb7 {I thought that I had, temporarly, gotten myself out of trouble.  I couldn't calculate everything but thought that if I got out with the monarch, in anyway, moved, he'd mate.  By playing this, it appeared that I was in better shape.  But, it's coming, one way or another with no to defend against it.} 21. Qd5+ Nc5 22. Qxc5+ Bb5 23. Nc6+ {And, I resigned here because Terence will mate on his next move.  My only two options are 23...Ka6, after which, he has 24.Qxa7# Or, 23...Ka4, and then comes 24.b3#}
