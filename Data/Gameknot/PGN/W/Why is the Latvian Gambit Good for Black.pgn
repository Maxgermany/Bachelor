1. e4 {This is a Latvian Gambit mini-tourney so the first three moves are set for each player.  I annotated it to try to explain to myself why this crazy opening, in which Black allows White to ransack his position early on and gain a significant material advantage, actually gives Black some winning chances.  The game ended in an interesting  opposite colored bishops stalemate, which makes the ending pretty interesting too.} e5 2. Nf3 {Looks like a standard opening...} f5 {Black offers a pawn.  why?  to speed his development and also, as most of the games in this tourney show, to open lines for his pieces (which is tantamount to development).} 3. exf5 {white takes} e4 {OK.  Here we start the tourney's original position.  Black kicks the knight.} 4. Ne5 {white chooses to target f7.  The other option is 4. Nd4 but the move chosen by White puts Black in a more stressful position because the threatened Qh5  has more venom with the knight here than on d4.  Why? because at 55 the knight puts pressure on the g6 square as well.} Nf6 {Paries the Qh5  threat.} 5. Be2 {Good move.  White announces he is going to check at h5 no matter what.  Plus he gets ready to castle.  He seems to be on offense, and he's already up a pawn.  why did I ever give up that pawn in this crazy opening?} d6 {Black tries to kick the white knight out.  Plus he opens the line for his c8 bishop and threatens the capture of that f5 pawn.} 6. Bh5+ {White follows through with his check.} Ke7 {Black has to move his king.  why is the opening still used by players with the black pieces?  Now I can't even castle....} 7. Nf7 {On top of that, White has forked Black's queen and rook on move 7.  Isn't Black supposed to get some initiative since he's the one who gave up the pawn??} Qe8 {This move saves the queen and it doubles the attack on white's Bishop if the knight takes the rook off the board.} 8. Nc3 {White gets the other knight into play. Other options were to (1) 8. Nxh8, taking the rook; (2) 8. Nxd6, discovering an attack on the Black queen and later, if Black liquidates queens on h5, to take the unprotected c8 bishop.} Nxh5 {Here Black cracks under the pressure and takes the bishop with the knight.  It might have been better to simply move the rook to g8.} 9. Nd5+ {White checks with the c3 knight now that Black's f6 knight has left its post.} Kxf7 {and Black has to move his king...} 10. Qxh5+ {White brings the queen out with check.  I ask again - what is black getting out of this?  he's the one who should be attacking!} g6 {a sheltering move - forced to protect the Black queen.} 11. fxg6+ Kg7 {Now Black is using his opponent's pawn as shelter.} 12. Nxc7 {and here is where I believe white played into the true spirit of Black's aims in Latvian gambit - he goes for material superiority at all costs.  It was from here on out that I began to understand this opening and why Black allows this dreadful position to arise in which none of his remaining pieces are developed, his king is using the other guy's pawns as shelter, and his rook is about to be taken off the table.  } Qxg6 {First things first, Black gets rid of that pawn, and hopefully he can exchange queens to lessen the threats to his exposes king.} 13. Qxg6+ hxg6 {Ok, mission accomplished.  Now take a look at this position.  True, none of Black's remaining pieces have moved from their starting positions, however he has massive amounts of open lines.  By virtue of the fact that Black has only five pawns to White's seven pawns, Black has open lines for his h8 rook, his c8 bishop.  And though the f8 bishop is blocked in, it won't be for long.   By comparison, White has all of his pawns in their original positions (except for the one that took part in the gambit) and his one active piece is about to corner itself all the way back on a8.} 14. b4 {This move serves two purposes:  it opens a line for the c1 bishop (threatening to check at b2 and win the exchange for Black's h8 rook) and it seeks to advance further to give the knight an escape after it captures on a8.} Kh7 {This is the only responsible move.  Black needs to contest that a1-h8 diagonal.} 15. b5 {Probably a bad move.  White should have played 15. Bb2 to get "first dibs" on that long diagonal.  His text move shows that he is too concerned with getting a free rook out of the transaction on a8.  } Bg7 {Obviously this is the best move.  Black gets his bishop on that nice diagonal with a gain of time since white will have to take a move to get his rook out of the way.} 16. c3 {But white chooses to close off the diagonal.   Not the best decision for two reasons:  (1) since white is less developed than Black (remember, Black has lots of open lines for his pieces, even though his pieces have not moved) he should encourage exchanges of material;  (2) white no longer has his light squared bishop, so he will be unable to defend this light squared weaknesses he has created with this move (this is exacerbated by the fact that Black still has his light squared bishop); (3) By moving the c2 pawn to c3, white has obstructed the mobility and influence of his bishop.  It would have been better to simply exchange it.  } e3 {Based on the errors made in the previous two notes, Black plays in the spirit of this opening and sacrifices another pawn.  This is why:  (1) that e4 pawn was simply in Black's way.  It was doing Black more harm than good.  The reason for this is that Black wants his c8 bishop mobilized to f5 to take advantage of all of those juicy light squared weaknesses.  } 17. fxe3 {white has to take with the f pawn otherwise he would lose a pawn and a rook if he took with the d pawn.} Bf5 {occupies the light squares and plans to head for d3.} 18. Nxa8 {White carries through with his material acquisitions.  Black is now down five points (equivalent to a rook).} Nd7 {This was not the best move.  better was an immediate 17. ...Bd3, preventing White from castling, but Black suspected that White would not castle on the next move anyway, as he has played to gain that rook for free for the past several moves.} 19. Nc7 {White gets the knight out unscathed.  But what has he gained for this five points?  who stands better?} Bd3 {Black stands better because now White cannot castle and he cannot even use f1 as a post for his h1 rook ad he can't mobolize his a1 rook either.} 20. a4 {So white starts to make some room for his pieces.} Nc5 {Black moves quickly to take advantage of his superiority in development as he is down a whole rook.  This move is designed to shield the d6 pawn from white bishop that is about to jump to a3.} 21. Ba3 {practically the only move available.} Ne4 {Now Black's knight jumps to an active position and it protects the d6 pawn.} 22. Ne6 {Good move for two reasons:  (1) it threatens Black's g7 bishop (remember that white would love to begin wholesale exchanges here so as to realize his material superiority) and (2) it takes the coveted f8 square from Black's rook. } Be5 {Black saves jis bishop from the knight and he further reinforces that weak d6 pawn, thus blunting the scope of white's a3 bishop.} 23. g3 {This was not the best as it creates a backward pawn on the half-open h-file and it allows for some tactics that favor Black.  Better was to immediately move the knight to f4 where it could have smoked out that troublesome d6 bishop and defended those light squares.} g5 {This move was played to prevent the knight from occupying f4, where it would be able to block off the f-file and defend those light squares that Black has dominance over.  It would also have threatened Black's light squared bishop, the crown jewel in his position.} 24. Bb4 {Now that white can't get his knight to f4, he tries to somehow mobilize his bishop to a better square.} Kg6 {This move opens the line for Black's h8 rook, which, although it has not moved once in the game, is as fully "developed" as any piece on the board.} 25. Nd4 {White moves the knight to e5 but it does no good from here as there is no time left to avert the following combination.} Bxg3+ {The h2 pawn is pinned against the threat of checkmate.} 26. Kd1 {only move.} Nf2+ {Black delivers a knight fork, returning the favor from earlier in the game.} 27. Kc1 {Best move.} Nxh1 {Takes the rook.} 28. hxg3 {Takes the bishop.} Nxg3 {takes the pawn} 29. Bxd6 {attacks the knight , but this move allows black to win a valuable pawn...} Rh1+ {The exchange of rooks is designed to force the White King into the corner of the board - an endgame disadvantage.} 30. Kb2 Rxa1 {Black figures that by forcing the white King all the way back to a1, he will have a king position advantage in the endgame.} 31. Kxa1 Ne4 {Forks the bishop and d2 pawn.} 32. Bb4 Nxd2 {wins the center pawn of white's central pawn majority.} 33. Ne6 {re-mobilizes the knight} Ne4 {and here is where Black makes a decisive mistake.  He wanted to block the advance of white's e pawn, thus not allowing his Bishop to have access to the queening square, but in mmaking this move he allowed a worse evil:  He allows an opposite colored bishops ending which takes away his winning chances.  Had he simply advanced his pawn to g4, he would have been on the way to a clearly winning endgame.  } 34. Nc5 {Excellent move in that white forces an exchange of knights.  } Nxc5 35. Bxc5 a6 {Black played this move with a defensive mindset - He was feeling the effects of his higher-rated opponent's endgame skills and he wanted to make it harder on him to clear a path for his queenside pawns.} 36. bxa6 {takes} bxa6 {takes} 37. Kb2 {White mobilizes his king - but where is it going?  } Be4 {A bad move - Black should have advanced the pawn.  what is the value in securing the queening square if his pawn never gets there? } 38. Kb3 {Black does not have much time left and he's allowed his presious passed pawn to sit idle for about 5 moves!} Kh5 {Black  moved his king here to that he could get get in front of the pawn.  If he were to advance the pawn first, then White could move his bishop to e7 to take away the h4 square from my king.} 39. Kb4 {White plays very methodically with a clear goal in mind.} Kg4 {Black continues trying to advance the king in front of his pawn.} 40. Be7 {Good move - white further frustrates the Black king's efforts to escort the pawn.  Black can't use the f4 square and if he moves my king to h4, then the pawn is pinned.} Kh5 {Now Black has to back-track to let the pawn go first.} 41. Ka5 {White is clearly winning now.  Black has to fight for a draw.  } Bb7 {Black tries to salvage the a pawn.} 42. e4 {White offers the e pawn to clear the way for the a pawn.} g4 {Black refuses the offer as the game depends on frustrating Whites efforts to queen the a-pawn.  } 43. e5 {It is looking pretty bad for Black now.} g3 {Black plays the only card he has left.} 44. e6 {white keeps the e pawn coming.  Now Black is starting to see the gravity of this situation...} Bd5 {Black decides to take the e-pawn and deal with the a-pawn later.} 45. Kxa6 {Mission accomplished for White!} Bxe6 {Now it is a two against one pawn majority in an opposite colored bishops game.  Black does jis best to save the game by getting his king into a useful position and by taking advantage of the Bishop's ability to occupy both of white's queening squares.} 46. Kb5 {white clears the path for the a-pawn} Kg6 {Black tries to get his king back to play defence.} 47. a5 {her it comes!} Kf7 {Black gains a move on his king march by attacking the bishop...} 48. Bd6 {white gets the move back by attacking the pawn.} g2 {Ok - Black's pawn is in position.} 49. Bh2 {And white puts his bishop on the best square.  The other diagonal (g1-a7) would not have been as good because he wants to occupy the squares between the Black king and the white pawns).} Ke7 {Black's king keeps moving into position.} 50. Kc6 {Shouldering Black's king - best move - like "boxing out" in basketball.} Bc4 {Best move as it prevents the a-pawn's advance and blockades the c pawn.} 51. Kb6 {White allows Black's king in, but he wants to get that a-pawn moving as that is the key to his winning chances.} Kd8 {Black takes the time to get better king position.} 52. a6 {Not the best move - White should have mobilized his king down to b8 - a safe square and one that would allow the queening of his pawn.} Kc8 {Better king position.} 53. a7 {The pawn no longer has any support after Black's next move.} Bd5 {White cannot queen the a-pawn now.} 54. c4 {White advances his other pawn - there is no way Black would take it of course.  The bishop is needed, at every second, to watch over a8.  } Ba8 {best move.  The a8 square is now occupied by black.} 55. c5 {The other pawn comes in to apply some pressure, but will it be enough?} Kd7 {Black's king shuffles, hoping for a "3-peat" repetition and a drawn game.} 56. Bg1 {White shuffles the bishop hoping that the white king will have to give ground when it is Black's turn to move.  He now commences a clever maneuver in which he uses lots of endgame trickery- triangulation zugzwang and other nuances to crack Black's defences.  } Kc8 {But the black king can shuffle back and forth...for now.} 57. c6 {The pawn advances.} Kd8 {The black king shuffles again, now to d8.} 58. Kc5 {The white king re-mobilizes.  Here come the endgame skills.} Kc7 {Black's king continues shuffling , while it can...} 59. Bh2+ {And white continues to net the Black king into a box.} Kd8 {Shuffling.} 60. Kd6 {The white king takes some of the shuffle squares from Black...} Kc8 {Black shuffles with what he has left.} 61. Bg1 {Is it almost a zugzwang situation for Black.   } Kd8 {almost...} 62. Bf2 {this move forces the king back to c8 (triangulation).} Kc8 63. Bb6 {and now white achieves his final aim:  Zugzwang (forcing the other guy to move in an way that is unfavorable for him).  Black has the choice of moving either the bishop or the pawn (since the king now has no legal moves left).  } Bb7 {But Black finds the best solution - sacrifice the bishop for the c6 pawn while still keeping control of a8 with the king.} 64. cxb7+ {sacrifice accepted...} Kxb7 {and a 8 is still controlled by Black.} 65. Bg1 {The Bishop retreats...} Ka8 {and now black can resume his shuffling since he controls a8 and b7.  If black takes away the b7 square, then, in this position...} 66. Kc7 {... it is stalemate!    I hope you enjoyed my annotations of this interesting game which contained instructive errors and ommissions by both sides during all phases of the game.    }
