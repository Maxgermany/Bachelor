[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), Chigorin variation"]

1. d4 {My opponent opens with d4.  I myself use the queen's gambit when white so I feel that this is a strong opening move.} d5 {Play continues..} 2. Nc3 e6 3. h4 {h4? white's first questionable move.  Now, I'm sure theres a purpose to this, but I don't see it.. maybe to defend his bishop soon to be on g5, but his bishop stays put costing white a tempo.} c5 {As I mentioned before I use the queen's gambit so I am now in a position I am very comfortable in as black.} 4. Na4 b6 {White's knight is not threatening to me, and allows me to free up my light squared bishop without losing tempo.} 5. b3 Bd6 {Now I can develop without having to worry about his pesky pawns.} 6. c4 {It looks like he wants to break up the centre, which is fine with me.} Nc6 7. e3 Nge7 8. dxc5 {I do not feel that this is in his best interest as I am much more developed than him and if we trade off pawns I will have centre control with all my big pieces.} bxc5 9. cxd5 Nxd5 {Capturing with my knight made it incredibly powerful. Just look at all the dark squares my centre three pieces are attacking.} 10. g4 {Don't even ask..} Bb7 {A very good spot for my bishop.} 11. Nxc5 {Nc5??? What a blunder! Trading his only developed piece for an isolated pawn?} Bxc5 {Just look at my development compared to white's.} 12. e4 {Should've done that while your knight was still protecting c3.} Nc3 {Attacking the queen and threatening checkmate.} 13. Qxd8+ {NOT a good time to trade queens.} Rxd8 {Now another powerful piece joins the attack! White looks to be in trouble here.} 14. Bb2 Nxe4 15. Nf3 Nb4 16. Rc1 {He sees my threatened fork, and moves to defend..} Nxf2 17. Rg1 {.. but he should have moved Rh2..} Nfd3+ {.. because this three-pronged fork and discovered attack on the rook leaves him in a much worse position than before.} 18. Kd1 {Now, would you take the bishop or the rook?} Nxb2+ {The bishop of course, and it soon become clear why.} 19. Ke2 Ba6+ {Ba6! Forcing the King back to e1.} 20. Ke1 Nb2d3+ {.. look familiar?} 21. Kd2 Nxc1+ 22. Kxc1 Bxg1 23. Bxa6 {With Nxg1 I would win a free bishop on f2..} Be3+ 24. Kb2 Nxa6 {.. but the result is the same.} 25. a4 O-O {Now it is not long before his impending doom.} 26. Ka3 Bc5+ 27. Kb2 h5 28. gxh5 Kh7 29. Ne5 {Careless..} Bd4+ 30. Ka3 Bxe5 {And white, understandably, resigns.}
