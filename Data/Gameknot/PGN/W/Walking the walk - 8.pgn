1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 {Stay in the book?  What do I know...} Bc5 5. O-O {King safety?  Think brave, get a rook in play.} O-O 6. Be3 {Although the data base agrees it would have been my desire to offer an exchange of bishops to open my rook file.} d6 7. h3 {To prevent  easy occupation of g4.} Bxe3 8. fxe3 {The pawn is doubled but the rook is in play.} Na5 {If black wants to exchange he will have made three knights to achieve it, and white will have developed a piece.} 9. Nbd2 Nxc4 10. Nxc4 {Knight takes to keep the pawns intact for a move or two longer.} b5 11. Ncd2 {Is black clearing the board for a clean field for a pawn march?  My queen side needs careful defence.} Bb7 12. a4 {Can i get my a rook into play or does it simply allow the pawn to b4 with support at a5 later?  My knights  are cozy but constrained.} a6 13. c4 {Don't like giving black choices but my knights are getting restless.} b4 14. Qb3 {I have backward pawns, and the black knight can come sweeping around , the queen is not too badly placed on the black king's diagonal, but the position is fragile.} a5 15. Qc2 {Making room for my b pawn to cement the pawns a bit, but i am very aware of all the backward pawns.} Re8 16. b3 c5 17. Qd1 h6 18. Qe1 Nh7 19. Nh2 {I need a bit of space to deal with the black advance, my e3 pawn is useful but eventually weak.} Bc8 {Don't want the black queen on my g file.} 20. Ndf3 f5 {I'll have that one.  If bishop takes  I'll push the e pawn free.  Free?  Somebody knows.} 21. exf5 Bxf5 22. e4 Bd7 {Ha! Just like a bishop - two moves to move one square.} 23. Ra2 Rf8 {Black can pressurize my f file - we'll stick a rook in there.} 24. Raf2 {More support for the knight} Qe7 25. Qe3 {Let the queen  see what's going on.} Rf6 26. Kh1 {Bit cozier here, and g1 might be home for a defensive piece one day.} Raf8 {Lottta rooks on this file.} 27. g4 Qf7 {I think someone has it in for my knight - I've only got 5 pieces to protect it with..} 28. Kg2 Rf4 29. Kg3 h5 30. Nh4 g5 31. Nh4f3 {Why not post it on f5?  I will never know, but after the rook exchanges  that murderous f-file might have been closed for a while} Qe6 32. Nxg5 Nxg5 33. Rf2xf4 Rxf4 34. Rxf4 exf4+ 35. Qxf4 Qe5 36. Qxe5 {Somewhat forced exchange.  Simpler is not always better.} dxe5 37. Nf3 {I knew this knight was needed to defend backward pawns, but was obsessed with the black knight's power on its current square and on d4.  The danger of the bishop sacrifice on a4  or g4 was also overlooked.  I would not normally play on at this point because the end-game is hopeless.   }
