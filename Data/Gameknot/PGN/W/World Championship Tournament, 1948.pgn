1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Nc6 {6... P-QN3! 7 B-Q2 B-N2 is stronger, as it forces 8 P-KB3 from White.} 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Ne2 b6 9. e4 Ne8 {A strong move, preventing 10 B-N5 and allowing the reply ...P-B4 if White tries P-B4.} 10. Be3 {A serious error of judgment. In the present position White must seek compensation for his doubled Pawns with active piece play, and a K-side attack should be prepared as quickly as possible. In the 16th Russian Championship Averbakh with the White pieces vs. Taimanov played 10 P-K5! P-B4 11 PxP e.p. QxP 12 B-K3 PxP 13 PxP B-R3 14 Q-B2 with a powerful attack in the works.} d6 11. O-O Na5 {White's prospects of active play are not sufficient compensation for the doubled Pawns. If he tries 12 P-B4, 12... P-B4 kills his Pawn advance and hems in his Bishops.} 12. Ng3 Ba6 13. Qe2 Qd7 {Black cannot be prevented from winning a Pawn. White's only hope is 14 P-K5, to create tactical chances on the K-side.} 14. f4 f5 {Stops White dead in his tracks.} 15. Rae1 g6 16. Red1 {Black does not need to rush things. The weak P on White's QB4 can be captured at leisure. First he must kill off White's potential tactical chances.} Qf7 17. e5 Rc8 18. Rfe1 {If 18 PxQP? NxP the Pawn on QB4 falls at once.} dxe5 {White must recapture with the QP, killing his K-side attacking chances. The game is now strategically won for Black.} 19. dxe5 Ng7 20. Nf1 Rfd8 21. Bf2 Nh5 22. Bg3 {An unpleasant, but necessary, move. The square K3 must be kept open, and 22 P-N3?? fatally weakens the long diagonal after 22... B-N2!! After the unstoppable follow up moves ...B-R1 and ...Q-QN2 White may as well resign.} Qe8 23. Ne3 Qa4 24. Qa2 Nxg3 {24... P-KN4 wins more quickly, but Black does not wish to allow counterplay by 25 PxP.} 25. hxg3 {Black has achieved his strategic goal with the unstoppable attack against the isolated Pawns. He now should seek an exchange of Queens.} h5 {A mistake, giving White a tactical possibility...} 26. Be2 {...which he overlooks. 26.B-B2! was the move. Black would still have the better position but White would be able to hold out longer.} Kf7 27. Kf2 Qb3 28. Qxb3 Nxb3 29. Bd3 {Otherwise ...N-R4 wins at once, as after... K-K2 Black would swap off the Rooks and win with ...P-KN4 and ...P-KR5, supported by the K.} Ke7 30. Ke2 Na5 31. Rd2 Rc7 {A serious mistake, enabling White to obtain counter-play. Both players were in severe time-pressure.} 32. g4 Rcd7 33. gxf5 gxf5 34. Red1 {A horrible blunder, leaving White with no good moves. 34 R/2-Q1!, to be followed by R-R1, deprives Black of any clear winning path.} h4 35. Ke1 Nb3 36. Nd5+ exd5 37. Bxf5 Nxd2 38. Rxd2 dxc4 39. Bxd7 Rxd7 40. Rf2 Ke6 41. Rf3 Rd3 42. Ke2 {And Botvinnik resigned, as after ...RxR KxR Black has a technically easy win.}
