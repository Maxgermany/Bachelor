Nf1 Nf8 {  Just in case there is any uncertainty with regards to the rules of this popular game, here is a summarised version of the 'Blide Verpoinian Chess rules'  ___ 1.1 Nature and Objectives:   All pieces behave in the same way as they do in conventional chess, moves alternate as usual.  The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's 2 rooks (not including promoted pawns) whilst avoiding checking the opponent's king. As soon as the opponent's king is checked, the opponent wins the game. If no move can be played without checking the opponent's king, the game is a draw. ___ 6.1 Special Rules:  If either player hesitates just as they are about to make a move, the opponent is allowed to cry out 'Maggot-Moose' and they will be rewarded with a free legal move of their opponents pieces. The words 'Maggot-Moose' must be said articulately; 'Magga-Moose', 'Maggom-Toos' or 'Mag-Moose' are not acceptable.  If a player temporarily leaves the game for any reason during play, it is acceptable for the opponent to slyly move pieces around at their discretion.  If for any reason, either player leaves the game before it has finished and doesn't return within exactly 5 minutes, both players must be roasted and fed to the spectators.  } 43. Nh2 {Alfrom Namanamic Safeway, (playing as white) a chess-prodigy Kweedite from the Purple Ocean had been tournament champion for the last 4  Olympics and was particularly hoping for another win so he would hold the record as the only Kweedite to win 5 consecutive Chess Championships (This was Safeway's final year before his Phorphism - a Kweedite tradition where the first-born in each family must sacrifice themselves to the Phortanak Sharks in return for peace among Purple Ocean races).  } f5 {Lord 'pawnonator' Jabborg (playing as black) was a newcomer to the Championship Chess scene and a favourite among the young chess audience (particularly Verpons). He had a controversial chess style - at the time, a respected only-recently-retired chess analyst commenting on one of his games, had remarked; 'his moves are stupid, his tactics are stupid, he's impatient and he's an outrageous cheater - If he gets to the final I'll retire'. This tournament was said to have been the first he had ever entered and won his first game against Garl Trowlaph (no. 4 in the Wackyworld chess standings) with an astonishing 600,000 to 1 odds against him. } 44. Reh1 {This move is a continuation of the 'corner-fort defense' (one of Safeway's favourite openers)} f4 45. Kf1 {As all Jabborg fans know, Jabborg has many unique pawn openings; this particular opening 'Jabborgian Torpedoes' involves launching the front line pawns 1 by 1 in the hope of overwhelming their opponent's defences.  Safeway continues his defence as expected.} fxe3 46. Bxe3 {The first torpedo found a target;  but Safeway, a very defensive player, has been known to 'never attack unless under attack'; it's a useful philosophy which has achieved him great success.} e5 47. Ne2 {And so, the 2nd black missile is fired;  Knight to e2 as expected} e4 48. Ng1 {Chess analysts who have studied the Verponian chess 'corner-fort defense' have discovered that even though it is strong, it is flawed by the necessity for the king to remain in 1 position for a long time. Ancient heroes of Verponian chess were successful for their great king maneuverability - the king being a valuable weapon in Verponian chess} exd3 49. Bxd3 {Jabborg strikes again, Safeway calmly levels the material difference.} d5 50. Kg2 {With another torpedo on it's way and the 'corner-fort defense' now in place, Safeway would likely begin to develop his remaining pieces} d4 51. Bf2 {Safeway chooses to reinforce the corner-fort} dxc3 52. Qxc3 {According to chess records; it was noted that, after this move, Jabborg had very quietly begun muttering incoherently, his head had lowered and his intense chess-board-gaze was now cast on Safeway, almost as if he was gazing deep into his Kweedite head - other than a slightly vacant look, Safeway didn't seem distracted and so play was continued.} c5 53. Bf1 {Jabborg (his gaze still set on Safeway) advances with his last pawn;     Safeway, looking slightly pale, seemed to be slightly over-defensive here - Chess analysts have commented that it was this point in the game when Kweedite's tactics had become somewhat unorthodox} c4 54. Qh8 {A very surprising move for Safeway - he's not usually known to move pieces that many squares in one move (particularly as his sitting-down-reach only facilitates moves as far as the 4th rank).   He had had to lean on the table to manage this move} c3 55. Qg8 {Incredibly - Safeway gives Jabborg his queen on a plate.} c2 56. Bg3 {Jabborg too pawn-determined to worry about anything else. Safeway's moves had become strange.  } c1=N {Also noted in the chess records was the fiasco that erupted after Jabborg's pawn reached the final rank; with the pawn sitting on C1 and Jabborg continuing to stare at Safeway's head, the referee asked 'to what piece will you promote?', Jabborg immediately turned his gaze to the referee and  grunted in his thuggish tone 'What did you just say?',  the referee repeated 'which piece are you going to promote to?', 'I wanna promote to pawn' said Jabborg,  'that's not allowed', 'it's allowed if I says it's allowed', 'well I'm sorry but you have to choose between a rook, knight, bishop or queen' (the nervous phrappenite had begun to sweat), Jabborg's brutish arm had picked up the referee by his wings and threatened 'I don't think you heard me right mate, I promote to a pawn otherwise I'm going to promote you to a friggin sack of phrappenite body parts'. Before anyone got hurt, the Moonlagoom Hall staff-abuse stewards had intervened and after Jabborg settled down, he reluctantly promoted to a knight.} 57. Rxc1 {During the commotion, Chess records say that Safeway had suddenly jerked as if he had woken up from a trance and prior to this move, he was staring at the board in disbelief and insisted that Jabborg had hypnotised him. After the referee shrugged his shoulders and gestured to continue play, Safeway angrily grasped his d1 rook and violently swiped the newly promoted knight off the board, off the table and landing, with a loud 'clang-clang-splatch' in Jabborg's spittoon (Jabborg was rarely known to be without his spittoon - he was a regular grophacco chewer)} Bxg8 {Feeling offended, Jabborg responded by grabbing the f7 bishop and, using his other hand, violently flicking the white queen off the table and smashing into a portrait of the 1st ever Kweedite chess champion 'The great Alphrom Saph', knocking it off the wall and falling to pieces on the ground. It was known that at this moment, Safeway stubbed out his gropherette, rolled up his sleeves, rubbed his hands and embarked on the most aggressive play ever known in Verponian chess history.} 58. Rxc7 {Safeway thrusts his rook into the opponents territory taking a bishop casualty.} Qxc7 {Jabborg nervously captures the valuable rook} 59. Bb5 {threatening the e8 rook} Na7 {A poor move, Jabborg was beginning to show signs of panic. } 60. Bxe8 {Jabborg was now down to 1 rook} Ra8 {Feeling vulnerable, Jabborg sweeps the other rook to a8 -  a desperate attempt to erect a corner-fort} 61. Bf7 Qb8 62. Bxg8 {Safeway was acting impulsively now} Nd7 63. Bxb8 {The black queen captured, both players were making their moves rapidly - it was recorded that at this point in the game, there was less than a second between each move. Safeway's moves were particularly frantic.} Nxb8 64. f4 Kf8 65. f5 {For the sake of a pleasant interlude to this intense annotation, it may be of interest to know the origin of the expression 'grophworthy' -  a term derived from the Gopite/Draphenium hybrid mineral 'Grophenite'; now and again, Wackyworld's clouds turn a yolky colour due to an infection from a vapour-eating parasite known as Loshtophitus. Fortunately, a government-paid agency known as 'A Whiter Wackyworld' are responsible for directly administering 'Grophenite' into clouds when symptoms first emerge and the parasite is rapidly dissolved. For as long as 80 years, common citizens from the Graw City would point a finger to the sky at a yellow cloud remarking 'that cloud's grophworty', over the years, the expression was adopted in many sports including, cloud-surfing, cloud-skiing, cloud-jesting, cloud-chestnuting, cloud-chess and eventually chess.} Kxg8 66. f6 {Safeway, presumably feeling very confident, uncharacteristically allows Jabborg to capture his bishop. Jabborg had now built his corner fort.} Kf7 67. Kf3 {The end to a succession of weak frantic moves by Safeway, now he reluctantly disconnects his king from the corner-fort} Kxf6 68. Ke4 Ke6 69. Kd4 {At this point, the game had reached a state of equilibrium and both players had now begun to collect themselves.} Kd6 70. Kc4 Kc6 71. Kb4 { } Kb6 72. Kc4 { } Kc6 73. Kd4 { } Kd6 74. Ke4 {With both players reluctant to attack with their corner-fort resources, the game was apparently going nowhere. At this point, the referee suggested to both players that they take a break and then finish the game with a 'Habbajoop duel' - Jabborg and Safeway enthusiastically agreed and adjourned to their respective dressing rooms. The referee then activated the Moonlagoom Hall tannoy (which is also connected to a speaker system in Moonlagoom park) and announced that the game was to be decided by a 'Habbajoop duel' and a 5 minute intermission would take place.} Kc5 75. Kf5 Kc4 76. Kg6 Kb3 77. Kg7 Kb2 {During the intermission, the chess records explain that after the referee had set-up the board to habbajoop formation, there was curious discussion taking place within the audience - many spectators were asking each other if they knew what a 'habbajoop duel' was. The sympathetic Phrappenite referee decided to use the tannoy to explain the rules and use the chess board (which was projected on a wall in Moonlagoom hall as well as clearly visible to spectators outside via video screen) to demonstrate the nature of the game.} 78. Ng4 Nd7 79. Nf3 Nb5 {Thanks to a squoppulant scirbe present at the game, the referee's exact words were recorded; 'The rules to Habbajoop dueling are as follows; both players must use only their own knights and attempt to 'Joop' or 'Sandwich' 1 or both of the opposing knights whilst avoiding capturing any of the knights or checking the opponent's king -'} 80. Nfe5 Nd4 81. Ne3 Nf6 {'Here is an example of a diagonal Joop - Black wins the duel.'} 82. Nf5 Nc6 83. Nf7 {'A vertical joop; white wins'} Ne8+ 84. Kg6 Nd6 85. Kg7 Kc3 86. Nd8 Kb2 87. Nd4 Kc3 88. Nd8e6 Kb2 89. Nb5 Kb3 90. Nbc7 Kc3 91. Nd5+ Kb2 92. Nb6 {'A horizontal double-joop; white wins'} Ne4 93. Nd4 Na7 94. Nd5 Nc8 95. Kf7 Nb6 96. Kg7 Nd7 97. Ne7 Ndc5 98. Nd5 {'Special positions such as these are good for white - whatever move black does, white can joop the other knight:'} Nc3 99. Nb5 {'like this; white wins'} Na6 100. Kg6 Nb8 101. Kg7 Nc6 {'Also, this position is good for black, white can't escape the diagonal joop'} 102. Nbc7 Ne4 103. Ne6 Nc5 104. Nef4 Na7 105. Ne3 Nd7 106. Ne2 Nb8 107. Ng4 Kb3 108. Ng1 Kb2 109. Nh2 {With Safeway and Jabborg returning from their dressing rooms, the referee rounded up his explanation; 'knights can only joop within the b7:G2 grid and players must make their moves immediately after their opponent has moved - only a split second delay is allowed, as soon as a player has been 'jooped', they must present their rook to a1 (if white) or h8 (if black) so that the opponent's king can capture and that colour will win the game!'} Nb5 {To any Verponian-Habbajoop-duel chess students who may be using this annotation, it may be helpful to use the annotation window (click the small window symbol) and rapidly click 'next move' between moves 109 and 127 to simulate the actual game which took place between these 2 chess titans.} 110. Ngf3 Na6 111. Ng4 Nb4 {Both Jabborg and Safeway were on their feet (Safeway stood on his chair) rapidly making their moves, one spectator present at the game had said 'their hands were a blur!' another spectator had likened this part of the game to a table-tennis match - particularly safeway, as he had to occasionally jump to achieve his moves.} 112. Nfe5 Nc3 {Jabborg stays close to his king for protection} 113. Ne3 Nc2 114. Nf3 Ne2 {Safeway can't joop vertically because it would be outside the grid.} 115. Nd4 Ne1 116. Nf3 Ng3 {a close double joop} 117. Nf1 Ng2 {Jabborg threatens a diagonal joop on the f3 knight} 118. Ng5 Nf4 119. Nh2 {In the heat of the game, Safeway misses an opportunity for the diagonal joop on e3} Ne4 120. Ng4 Nd5 121. Ne5 Nec3 { } 122. Nh3 Ne2 123. Nf2 Ng1 { } 124. Nd7 Ne2 125. Nc5 Nef4 { } 126. Ng4 {Bombshell! Safeway had caught Jabborg in a Kweedian death trap - there was no way he could escape defeat now. Whichever knight Jabborg moved, Safeway would joop the other knight.} Nc3 { } 127. Ne4 {After this move, a huge cheer had gone up in the audience, Safeway had gloriously punched his arms into the sky and Jabborg was just staring at the horizontal joop in utter disbelief. } Rh8 {Completely gutted, Jabborg, with a sulkish facial expression, reluctantly moved his rook to h8 (so that Safeway can capture the final rook and win the game - as the rule dictates)} 128. Ra1 {Safeway, with a gladdened look of relief, calmly stretched from his chair to the other side of the board to capture the rook_____ But as he was about to, Jabborg suddenly, very violently kicked one of the legs of Safeway's chair causing him to come crashing down on to the chess board and seriously injuring his left shoulder! Lord Jabborg quickly stood up and roared; 'MAGGOT MOOSE!!!'. Jabborg (still stood up) viciously hurled Safeway off the chess board and after plonking the white rook on a1 - } Kxa1 {Capturing! The spectators in Moonlagoom hall and the audience outside were stunned into silence. Lord Jabborg (holding up the recently-captured white rook in one hand and the Krompoborg trophy in the other) was staring out to the audience with a victorious mad glare laughing like a maniac. His evil laugh was apparently heard as far as the Graw City outskirts and a commentator of the match had likened his powerful winning-player manner to the intimidating personality of a political dictator. 1 month following this game, Lord Jabborg had become mayor of Graw city, 1 year later he had become president of Zaltang and 6 months after that, the Verponian race had declared war on the Purple ocean and many races (particularly Kweedites) had been chased out of their homes, separated from their families, brutally tortured or even destroyed. Good game!}
