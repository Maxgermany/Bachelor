1. Nf3 {I love Clydesdale Horses! They dance and prance around so majestically. It's a beautiful thing to behold.   ************************************************************************** Watch my Clydesdale dance!  **************************************************************************  Note the beginning of the game has little or no annotation as I felt the moves were good. Annotations start on move 12. Annotation Updated Wednesday, July 25, 2010} d5 { } 2. c4 { } e6 { } 3. e3 { } Nf6 { } 4. b3 { } Bd6 { } 5. Bb2 { } O-O { } 6. d4 { } b6 { } 7. Bd3 { } Bb7 { } 8. Nbd2 { } c5 { } 9. O-O { } dxc4 { } 10. bxc4 { } Nbd7 {There is commentary in the following pages.} 11. Re1 { } cxd4 { } 12. exd4 {Black has traded away his advanced pawns, removing all tension in the center. Not usually a good idea.} Qc7 { } 13. Ne5 {Interesting. He has his queen and both bishops bearing down on my king side. I will play Qc2, thus getting the same type of attack against his king. I want to block his impending attack on my king while keeping my own lines open, thus Ne5.} Rad8 { } 14. Qc2 { } h6 { } 15. Ndf3 { } Bb4 { } 16. Re2 { } Nxe5 { } 17. Nxe5 { } Bd6 { } 18. Rae1 { } Bb4 {He's moving that one bishop too much in the opening: Move 4. ... Bd6; Move 15. ... Bb4; Move 17. ... Bd6; Move 18. ...Bb4. That's 4 moves for 1 piece in the 1st 18 moves of the game. That is 22% of his moves are made by 1 piece! In so doing he is slowing up his own development.} 19. Rf1 { } Nd7 { } 20. f4 { } f6 {This move leaves weaknesses on the white squares surrounding his king; a deadly mistake. I will make him pay!} 21. Bh7+ {The set up! He has to go the corner where my Knight can check him forking his king and rook. He is forced to take the bishop.} Kh8 { } 22. Ng6+ {So the Clydesdale begins to prance!} Kxh7 { Forced} 23. Nxf8+ {I take the rook with discovered check from the queen.} Kg8 { } 24. Nxe6 {When he got out of check, I take his king pawn, forking his queen and remaining rook! What a sequence!} Qc6 { } 25. Nxd8 {Black resigns. He could have gotten the knight by moving his queen to c8 or b8 instead of c6, but it would not matter. He's given me too much.}
