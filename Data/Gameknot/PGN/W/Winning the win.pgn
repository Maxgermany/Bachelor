[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 c5 2. f4 {Grand Prix Attack.  A good, aggressive line to play against the Sicilian, though it does tend to telegraph the punches, just a little bit...} d5 {This is usually why you don't see the Grand Prix all that much.  But White's game is still quite playable.} 3. Nf3 {Invites Black's reply.  White has a certain gambit in mind...} dxe4 4. Ng5 {Inviting ...Nf6 to protect the lead e-pawn.  White is aiming for a line I have dubbed the 'Demolition Derby' Attack:  4...Nf6  5.Bc4!? (apparently allowing Black to win White's Queen) ...Bg4  6.Bxf7ch Kd7  7.Qxg4 Nxg4  8.Be6ch ... 9.Bxg4.  For the Queen, White gets active play and Black has difficulty just developing.  The jury is still out on the soundness of this ultra-violent line.  (I wonder if  'A Clockwork Orange' Attack wouldn't be a better appellation?  Maybe that should go with the Caro Kann version...).  } e5 {Black is having none of it.  Jo has built up a fund of experience with the 4...Nf6 line, which may be why Charles gave it the go-by.} 5. Bb5+ {(!?) I have my doubts about this, though I won't condemn it out of hand.  It seems to me 5.Bc4 was still a good move here.} Bd7 {The obvious response.  Yet there was something to be said for 5....Nc6, even though Black might have got a lot of doubled pawns scattered about: 5...Nc6  6.Bxc6 bxc6  7.Nxe4 exf4 ...} 6. Bxd7+ Nxd7 7. Nxe4 exf4 {In effect, White has gambited a pawn, but doesn't have all that much for it.  Could this be one of those positional gambits the hypermoderns used to play, with a view to the ending?  White has the Q-side majority (which proves to be a major motif in this game), but realising it seems a long way off.} 8. O-O {Pragmatic: continuing her development.  But worth considering was 8.Qe2, a move that has some developmental value, but tests Black's alertness.  If he were to play, say, 8...Nf6 then 9.Nd6# ends proceedings right there.  Black would just about have to play his lone already-developed piece (8...Ne4) to remain on roughly level terms.} f5 9. Nec3 {Rather awkward, as it interferes with the development of the other knight.  Too bad: there doesn't seem to be anything better.} Bd6 {An interesting development.  Black wants to maintain that lead f-pawn for as long as possible.  Was he already contemplating a direct attack upon White's King?  Note that the bishop exerts, through the f-pawn, a certain amount of pressure on h2.} 10. d3 Qh4 {(!?)  Sticking to his plan of attack against h2, and maintains the lead f-pawn for the time being as well.  The GK engine mislikes this in favour of 10...Ne2  11.Nb5!? Be5  12... 0-0-0.  This alternative is less committal, but equally less forcing.  The game continuation does, however, give White the opportunity for counter-action.} 11. Qf3 {(!?) Thematic, but the GK engine indicates 11.Nb5 ought to have come first, with attack against d6 and c7.  After 11.Nb5 the engine suggests 11...Bb8  12.Qf3 with threats against f4 and b7.  But 11...Be5 seems better, as after 12.Qf3 Ne7  13.Qxb7?? Rb8  14.Qa6 Rb6  looks very nasty.  Instead 13.Bxf4 keeps things more or less level.  My own view is that the text move is unobjectionable.} g5 {Further protection for f4, and stormclouds appear to be gathering darkly on the King-side.  Though 11...0-0-0 was more solid, White would have been able by 12.Bxf4 somewhat to blunt Black's attack.  As it happens, White doesn't appear to be much fazed by Black's threatening attitude...} 12. Qxb7 {Wins back the pawn, and leaves Black centre and Q-side looking very porous.} Rb8 13. Qd5 {(!?) Sensible-looking, and centralising, yet the GK engine doesn't approve.  According to its wisdom, 13.Qa6 ought to have been played.  I'm inclined to agree, as that move combines attack on a7 as well as d6.  But I think White wanted to keep the Queen nearer the action, bearing in mind, her Q-side has yet to make a move.} Be5 {(!) Good defence: keeps a watch over f4 (and h2), and closes off the e-file (else White might have continued Qe6ch and Re1).  } 14. Qe6+ {As planned, I suspect, but White might equally well have considered beginning to bring out her Q-side: 14.Nd2, with 15.Nf3 to follow.  Black has a bit of a lead in development that White can not afford to see become much longer.} Kd8 {Black has to forgo castling as after 14...Ne7  15.Nd5! g4  16.Bxf4 Bxf4  17.Rxf4 Kd8 and white can exchange down into a very promising endgame: 18.Qxe7ch Qxe7  19.Nxe7 Kxe7  20.b3 - White would have the stronger pawns and an extra pawn as well.} 15. Qxf5 {(!?) Once more, GK prefers 15.Nd2.  But White has it in mind to stymie once and for all, Black's K-side offensive.} Nh6 16. Qh3 {Forcing the exchange, but in fact White had no choice, here.  Black's ...Ng4 threat had to be answered at once.  Now the Queens come off.} Bd4+ {An intermezzo.  Black uses the check to improve the placing of the bishop.} 17. Kh1 Qxh3 {According to the GK analysis, Black's (slight) edge was slowly dissipating.  This can be a problem when gambiting material, which in effect Black has done in recent moves, and is now a pawn behind.  That the Queens are disappearing won't be altogether welcome in that context.  Once the compensating intangibles (time, space, initiative) disappear, which they tend to do given time, then the material advantage will come into its own.  } 18. gxh3 Nf5 {Discouraging the knight's development to d2?} 19. Na3 {Apparently so.  Interestingly, GK suddenly gives a noticeable plus in favour of Black at this point, but without giving any reason why, or noting any improvement White might have.  19.Nd2? Ne3 could not be countenanced, but how about 19.Ne4, preparing the way for the other knight?  An interesting forcing line ensues: 19.Ne4!? Ne3  20.Bxe3 Bxb2  21.Bd2 Bxa1  22.Ng5 with a complicated endgame to look forward to.  That White will have given up the exchange offers an intriguing counterpoint to the actual game.} Nd6 {(!?) Inhibiting the a3-Knight's further progress.  Also playable here was ...Bxc3, breaking up White's pawns.} 20. Rb1 {To free up the bishop.  White is steadily catching up in development.  However, 20.h4 was worth looking at, to disrupt Black's K-side (though Black would probably have responded ...h6).} Re8 21. Bd2 {At last, all White's pieces are in action, though Black's are still appreciably the more dynamic right now.  But there's the distinct feel to the game that suggests White is gradually beginning to assert her own stamp on proceedings.  If Black wants to make progress, he'll have to do something - and that pretty shortly.} Rb6 {(!?) Aron Nimzovitch used to write about the 'mysterious rook move'.  Well, the motivation for this move is pretty obscure, unless Black was planning on a switch to the a-file or maybe to the K-side.  Or did Charles have some nefarious other scheme in mind?  We'll come to that...} 22. Rfe1 {A pawn ahead, White wants piece exchanges, provided she doesn't have to make concessions to bring them about.  All the same, 22.h4 was still worth considering.} Rxe1+ 23. Bxe1 h5 {This pawn phalanx is Black's strike force, and will always constitute a danger White has to watch.  White's majority on the other wing will take much longer to mobilise.  All the same, the GK engine rated the position as dead level at this point.  I'm inclined to agree.} 24. Kg2 Ke7 {(?/?!)  The first real mistake of the game, according to GK.  A straightforward oversight, it must have seemed to Jo when she saw this position.  But, you know, I am beginning to wonder about that.  Could Black have seen that his advantages were gradually eroding away, and something needed to be done to create a wider range of possibilities, even at the risk of conceding to his opponent real winning chances?  Maybe Charles can answer that question...} 25. Nd5+ {Correct.  There's nothing against taking the proffered material, and everything to recommend it.} Ke6 26. Nxb6 axb6 {Now is the time to assess the situation.  White is the rough equivalent of a piece ahead: Rook and pawn for a Knight.  But the extra pawn is doubled, and a Rook's pawn at that.   Further, Black's pieces are all nicely centralised, with plenty of collaborative potential.  White's for the moment remain scattered.  And there is that niggling problem of the Black K-side majority, well advanced, and ready to go if given the chance.  I'm not saying Black has enough to hold on even for a draw; but he's got plenty to have a good old crack at it, and even maybe turn the tables.  White has to tread very carefully, and yet play decisively enough not to let slip her own chances to win.  Game on!} 27. Bf2 {Not a bad start: offer a piece exchange.  After 27..Bxf2 28.Kxf2, White will have conceded nothing to rid herself of Black's most mobile piece.} Bf6 {So: no sale.} 28. Nc4 {(?!)  Offering another exchange, but this does concede something, and more in my view than White ought to have been prepared to yield.  GK agrees, preferring 28.b4.  Now the line GK follows is certainly very attractive for White: 28.b4 cxb4!?  29.Rxb4 Bc3  30.Rb1 Bd2(!?)  31.Bxb6 Nxb6  32.Rxb6 Be3.  At this point GK gives 33.Rb8, but I would probably play instead 33.Rxd6ch Kxd6  34.Nc4ch Kc5  35.Nxe3 fxe3  36.Kf3 Kd4  37.a4.  Even at the cost of giving up the exchange, this simplification brings us down to a winning pawn ending.  If Black tries 28...Bd4, then 29.bxc5 brings about the mobilisation of White's own pawn majority.} Nxc4 29. dxc4 {Writes down part of White's material advantage, and with this pawn doubled, the White majority will be a little harder to get going.  While I'm at it, many beginners and probably intermediate players too, find minor pieces difficult to use without the aid of the heavy pieces.  This game offers a fine example of how they might be handled even in a difficult defence.  Be it noted, though: White still has a considerable, probably winning, edge, here.} Ne5 30. Re1 Kf5 31. b3 {Really I don't like this move, but it can't be helped.  The lead c-pawn requires protection.} g4 {Black has seized the initiative - for the moment at least - to make progress on the K-side.   But White seems well placed in defence on that wing.} 32. hxg4+ hxg4 {Well: White's h-pawn has been 'undoubled', for what that might be worth...  That means that there are fewer obstacles in frnt of Black's K-side pawns.} 33. Rd1 {I can't find any improvement for either side in the last 5 moves.  Black's K-side has made some progress, but seems to be stymied for now.  White now conjures up a threat of her own to mobilise her Q-side.  Once those pawns break loose. it will be all up for Black.} Ke6 {Hence this retreat, to keep the rook out of d6.} 34. a4 {(?!) I believe that Jo had already worked out a plan to mobilise the Q-side in which this pawn was to advance to a5, backed up by the bishop on the e1-a5 diagonal.  I'll come back to that.  But I really dislike this move as making it harder to unleash the pawns.  Preferable is 34.a3, with the b4 advance in mind.  One possible line is 34.a3 Nc6 (say)  35.Rd5ch Be5  36.h4! f3ch  37.Kf1 Bf4  38.h5 g3  39.Bxg3 Bxg3  40.h6 and, ironically, White's K-side pawn wins the day!  } Nc6 {Black has certainly the upper hand on the dark squares.  But it's hard to see how even this will prevail in the long run, given White has the means to contest Black's dark-square ascendancy: her bishop.  } 35. Be1 {(?!) Here is Jo's plan: to shove forward the Q-side pawns with the bishop's backing.  The c-pawn will be undermined, and the rook will take it out.  Well thought out, but, and this was sheer bad luck, it turns out to be a mistaken plan.  By committing herself to the Q-side, White allows Black some slack on the other wing.  There were good alternatives in 35.Rd5; 35.Bg1 (I like this move); or even in waiting 35.Kf1.  However, This is not the losing move - in fact, I reckon White still had the winning of the game after this move, but this was one of those rare situations in which following a plan proves ones undoing.} Nd4 36. Bd2 {(?) With this move probably White's winning chances start to fade away.  The GK engine prefers 36.Rd2 here, though with ...Bg5 and ...f3ch in the air, it is easy to pass this move by.  After 36.Rd2 Bg5  37.Kf1 Ke5  38.Bf2 f3  39.Bxd4ch cxd4  40.Rd3 Ke4  41.Rd1 Bf4   42.Kg1 Bg5  43.b4 Bh4  44.Kf1 and Black's K-side attack is running out of steam whilst White's pawns are ready to roll.  A whole different plan, which seems less to teeter on the edge of the abyss, was 36.c3! with the idea 36...Nxb3 37.Rb1 Na5 38.Rxb6ch Ke7  39.Rb5 Nxc4  40.Rxc5.  } Kf5 {The GK engine still gives White an edge, but already this is looking doubtful.  Though still nominally a piece down, Black still has that menacing K-side, and the more active pieces and pawns.  White's game is looking harder to get rolling than even a couple of moves ago...} 37. a5 {According to plan.  More complicated was 37.b4, but it might have been worth a look.} bxa5 38. Bxa5 Nxc2 {The complicating factor is the threatened fork at e3, which persists after White's next.  All the same, GK now considered the game evenly balanced.  This would have been a disappointment to Jo, but, immersed as she was in her scheme to break the chains about her Q-side pawns, no doubt thought she still had the better of it and soon she would be home free.} 39. Rd5+ Ke4 40. Rxc5 {(?) Twin passers on the Q-side!  The culmination of White's plan... and the move that put even the draw out of reach.  It just one of those horrible situations in which you suddenly realise that the creaking of the thin ice that you thought was coming from under the other guy's feet were actually being caused by your own bootsteps.  Who said it?  'Chess is a cruel game...'  Better chances of a draw were offered in these lines: [a] 40.Rd7  f3ch  41.Kf1 Bd4  42.Bd2 Kd3  43.Bg5 Na1  44.Rf7 Nxb3   45.h3  Be3  46.Rd7ch Bd4  47.Rf7 with a repetition; or [b] 40.Bd2 f3ch  43.Kf1 Be5   44.Rxc5 Bxh2  45.Rg5 g3  46.Rg4ch Kd3  47.Bf4 g2ch (...Ne3ch=) 48.Kf2 g1=Qch  49.Rxg1 Bxg1ch  50.Kxg1 =.} f3+ 41. Kf1 {(?) But 41.Kh1 still lost after 41...f2  42.Kg2 Bh4  43.Re5ch! - The best White can do to slow things down was to give up the rook for nothing - 43...Kxe5.  Mind you, White could still have resisted for a while, even brought about a close finish:  44.Bb6 Ne1ch  45.Kf1 Nf3  46.Bxf2! Nxh2ch!  47.Kg2 Bxf2  48.Kxf2 Kf4  49.b4  {or 49.c5 Nf3  50.c6 Nd2!  51.c7 Ne4ch  52.Kg2 Nd6  53.b4 Nc8 etc} 49...Nf3  50.b5 g3ch  51.Kg2 Nh4ch  52.Kg1 Nf5  53.c5 Ne7  54.c6 Ne8 etc.  Interesting also would have been 41.Kg3 Bh4ch!  42.Kxh4 f2  43.Bc7 f1=Q  44.Re5ch Kd3, but White's pawns are too scattered and weak for her to set up any kind of fortress.} Ne3+ 42. Kg1 Bh4 {(0-1) At this point Jo tossed in the sponge: there's no cure for ...f2ch.  There's a good deal to be got out of this game.  For one thing, it shows how hard it can be to overcome a determined defence.  In this game, for all his material deficit, Black had a good deal to play with, so White's task to win the game was no light matter.  It was her truly evil luck to hit on a plan of attack that seemed to promise a clear path to her goal - her Celestial City -  only to discover it was the road into the Slough of Despond.   Ask Christian: some days you just can't win.}
