1. e4 e5 {I was delighted when I saw this move.Usually,I get 1...c5 when I play this move.I play 1...e5 myself so I know a lot from the White side also.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Also good is 2...Nf6.The petroff defense.} 3. Nc3 {The boring four knights game.} Nf6 4. Bb5 Bb4 5. O-O Bxc3 {!? More popular(and main line) is 5...O-O 6.d3 d6 7.Bg5 Bxc3 8.bxc3 Qe7 9.Re1 Nd8 10.d4 Ne6 11.Bc1 c5.} 6. dxc3 {Probably better is 6.bxc3,capturing toward the center.} d6 7. Re1 Bd7 8. Bg5 a6 {Kicking the light-squared Bishop back.} 9. Ba4 b5 {Staying true to his plan.} 10. Bb3 Na5 11. Bxf6 {Not sure why I made this move.} Qxf6 12. Qe2 {Connecting my rooks.} Nxb3 13. cxb3 O-O 14. c4 {Trying to get rid of the doubled pawns on b2 and b3.} c6 15. cxb5 axb5 16. a4 {Same idea as move 14.} b4 {?! This move is debateable as it gives White an outside passed pawn,which he uses to win the game.} 17. Red1 {Going after the d6 pawn and preventing 17...d5.} c5 {?! This move is also debateable as it gives White an outpost on d5 and the d6 pawn is backward.} 18. Rd2 {Ganging up on the pawn.} Bg4 19. Rad1 Bxf3 {? This move loses a pawn.Black thought he could get the pawn back,but this allowed the a-pawn to storm down the board.} 20. Qxf3 Qxf3 21. gxf3 f5 22. Rd2xd6 fxe4 23. fxe4 Rf4 {Attacking the e4-pawn.} 24. Re1 Raf8 {This is the line where Black thought he could win the pawn back.} 25. Rd2 Rf4f3 26. Re3 {Giving White weak e-pawns.The a-pawn is compensation for this though.} Rxe3 27. fxe3 Rf3 28. a5 Rxe3 29. Kf2 {An important move,not allowing the rook to get back to catch the pawn.} Rxe4 30. Rd8+ {This move is very important since 30.a6 Rf4 allows Black to get back.} Kf7 31. a6 {The pawn is unstoppable} Rd4 {Black realizes that the pawn is unstoppable and throws in the towel.} 32. Rxd4 cxd4 33. a7 {Black resigns.}
