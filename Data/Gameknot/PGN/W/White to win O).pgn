[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A46)"]

1. d4 {The parrot is a demon two-knights defender and he plays the sicilian like Don Corleone. So the horse is wise to open on the queen side.  (Gratuitous boasting of course, but these are my annotations!)} Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e3 {White has chosen a sort of Queen's gambit declined position to avoid the Nimzo.  Do I play c5 myself ?} c6 {Hmm .. this is a sort of Slav defence or something .. will it weaken my Queenside ?} 4. c4 {This has transposed into a Slav} dxc4 {I didn't consult my opening book for this.  Is it right ?} 5. Bxc4 b5 {This reminds me of some of the Benoni positions I used to play and always lose...} 6. Bb3 a5 7. a4 b4 8. O-O {My advanced b-pawn is definitely a plus, but I'm well behind on the king-safety stakes and Dr. Evil is going to have fun on the two major light-square diagonals.} Bf5 {Developing this B is always the problem.  I think Bg5 is wrong because it'll get shut out from the Q side.  Is this move premature, though ??} 9. Bc2 e6 {Would bg6 have been better?  Or simply Bxc2 ? The bishop is now shut out from Q side which is what I' was trying to avoid.  Still at least my f8 bishop can move.} 10. Bxf5 exf5 {I expect Qc2 threatening both pawns, but I'm planning Qc8 in response. It's gonna be a bit defensive for a while.  I'm not in control here! } 11. b3 {Giving the shut-in bishop development at b2.  Evil.  He's saving Qc2 for a better moment.} Be7 12. Qc2 Qc8 {Bad move from the parrot.  Qd5 was surely right and solves all my problems. Bleeeugghhhh !!} 13. Bb2 {White has all the space in the centre, but I've still got those good queenside pawns. If i can get my pieces active I'm OK. I think.} O-O {I'll curl up like a hedgehog, but have i got any spines ?} 14. Nbd2 {Threat of NC4 is looking strong for the bad guy.  I, on the other had want to exchange queens.  Use my queenside pawns for an eventual positional victory.} c5 {I'll be rid of the backwards pawn (good) but he's gonna have a big bishop (could be very bad)} 15. Rfe1 {He's now got tactics on the e-file as well, and I've got to worry about an eventual rook-lift to e5.  However, the queens are going, and thats a plus for me.} cxd4 16. Qxc8 Rxc8 {is that rook good on the c-file or not ?  And where's my knight going to go now its relieved of its defensive duties.} 17. Nc4 {Passive sacrifice of e-Pawn is offered.  Is this sac a positional one to give B on b2 and e-file rook more play ?  Or is it tactical and he's planning Nb6 ??} dxe3 {I'll accept the sacrifice.  Nb6 looks good, but after Rc2! ( not exf right away) I'm winning but its a bit double edged.  (In some variations, a later BC5 is a killer move for Black)} 18. Nxe3 {OK - so the enemy has eschewed the tactics of Nb6 and made the pawn sacrifice a postional one.  I've got my extra pawn but my advanced pawn is weak,  B on e7 is vulnerable (but required to avoid hopeless tripled pawns) .  Can I play g6 here and take a permanent dark-square weakness? (live annotation)} Nc6 {No definitely not g6. Also f4, Nbd7 quickly lead to loss for black.  White's positional sac is fully justified as he will win the pawn back with a plus (at least doubling/isolating all blacks K-side pawns)  The position for black is bad, but is it desparate yet ?} 19. Nxf5 {White's position is looking overwhelming with e-file and diagonal ...} Rce8 {It's all looking a bit desparate for black ... was Bc5 an alternative.} 20. Rac1 {And with final piece in play the forces of evil triumph yet again... A clear piece up and with no counterplay, it's clearly all over for the bird once again ....  Never really recovered from the mistake on move 12. }
