[Opening "Latvian counter-gambit (C40)"]

1. e4 {Standard fair, not going with any of my lesser practiced openings against a 2000+ player. } e5 2. Nf3 f5 {The Latvian Counter-Gambit.  If I ever played against this before, I have no recollection of doing so.} 3. Nc3 {So I proceed cautiously in unknown territory.} fxe4 4. Nxe4 {A trade of pawns and I'm feeling a little more comfortable.} d5 {Bigpeta gaining central position with pawns early.} 5. Nc3 e4 6. Nd4 {Shuffling the knights, some space to play in is available, although my opponent controls the tempo.} Nf6 7. d3 {I did this to open up the bishop for a possible Bg5, pinning the knight against the queen...} c5 {But that is disallowed by a further attack on one of my knights.  This is beginning to feel like the Alekhine defense. } 8. Nb3 {Not many other options here, still not a horrible position to be in...} exd3 9. cxd3 {I recapture, not recapturing would have allowed 9 ... c4.  Not that he would have played that particular move, but it was on my mind and I felt the need to develop other pieces.} Be7 {He's a step ahead of me, here I don't have to abandon Bg5, but I do anyway...} 10. Qe2 {A mistake.} O-O {A powerful castle.} 11. Qd2 {Another mistake.  I am aiming my queen towards the kingside with this move, but I'm also pinning in a bishop that would probably be better off developed.} Nc6 12. Be2 {Preparing to castle...} d4 13. Na4 {Running out of room with the knights.} c4 14. dxc4 {Forced.} Ne4 {The attack is coming, I may own a temporary material advantage, but I'm losing pretty handily at this point.} 15. Qc2 {Really nowhere else to go with the queen at this point.} Bb4+ 16. Nd2 {I should have placed the bishop I've been dying to develop there instead of the knight.  I can see why I thought to move the knight, there's room on the board and I would much rather give away a knight and win a bishop, the knights are stranded uselessly on the side of the board anyway.  I still prefer Bd2, however.} Bf5 {Things are getting worse by the move!} 17. O-O {A minor and temporary escape.} Nxd2 18. Qd1 {A nice attack by peta and I simply have to lose material...} d3 19. Bxd2 {I have to gain something...} dxe2 20. Qxe2 {Not much choice but to take.} Nd4 {The onslaught continues.} 21. Qd1 {There really isn't much going on here for me, there are so many guns aimed at my pieces that I would consider resigning in a regular game.  Alas, that's against the rules of WtW.} Bxd2 {More material gained...} 22. Nc5 {I can't capture the bishop with the queen because it's followed by Nf3+, 23. Kh1 Qxd2.  This knight move was the first time I was able to cross the center of the board in this game, peta took the initiative from the beginning and forced me to play on my heels in retreat.} Qg5 23. Kh1 {A move in response to the pressure being placed on my g2 pawn.} Bc2 {But I missed his true intention...} 24. Ne6 {A weak move, knowing I'll lose my knight seems ok if I can capture the c2 bishop in response.} Qh6 {Didn't expect that...} 25. Qg4 {Seems logical, just a bit too late.} Nxe6 {I couldn't have saved that knight anyway.  I made an effort but peta's pieces are dominating the entire board at this point.} 26. a4 {In hopes of bringing out the rook to a3 and then hopefully a playable position.} Rf4 {So much for that idea...} 27. Qg3 Rh4 28. h3 {Trying to avoid mate at all costs at this point.} Nf4 29. Kh2 {Moving the king up as another defender for the h pawn.  I do understand the positioning of my queen and king here is extremely dangerous, I just don't know what else to do.} Nxh3 30. Kh1 {Retreating the king to avoid a possible spear with the bishop.  } Nf4+ {A discovered check and mate is approaching.} 31. Qxh4 {The game's already over, I can see the defined mate, but am playing it out in accordance with the rules and out of respect for my opponent.  After all, how often does he even get a checkmate?  At his level I'm sure he only sees draws and resignations, right?  ;)  } Qxh4+ {Queen captures...} 32. Kg1 {King moves...} Ne2# {Knight moves, checkmate.  I hope you enjoyed the annotation and were able to learn a thing or two from the lesson bigpeta handed my way.  I wish good game to peta and can't wait to lock horns with him again real soon!}
