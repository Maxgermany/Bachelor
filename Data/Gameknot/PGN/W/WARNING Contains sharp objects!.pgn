[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C64), classical (Cordel) defence"]

1. e4 {A normal opening} e5 {my stock response. I have tried out the sicilian (1. ...c4), but didn't like the choices my opponent could have as to how open or closed the game was, and the French (1. ... e6), but quickly found I had a huge space disadvantge, and so retured to this.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez, whites most common opening.} Bc5 {A little seen response, but a good one. I beleive this is called the Cordel variation, but I'm not sure. It threatens to fork the knight on e5 (after 4. BxN dxB 5. Nxe5 Qd4) and a mate on f7, which will result in black winning back the pawn and having a superior position.} 4. Bxc6 {My opponent duly obliges and takes the knight.} dxc6 {I continue as planned. In a normal Ruy Lopez position, black would take with the b pawn, to gain more control in the centre. } 5. g3 {I'm not sure what this move was for. My opponent doesn't have an LSB to fianchetto, and this just creates weaknesse on g4, h3 and the knight on f3. The only reason I could think of was to move the knight, push f4 and then castle queenside. However, I would continue development before trying anything like this.} Nf6 {I continue my development with an attack on the undefended pawn on e4.} 6. Nxe5 {My opponent now takes the 'free' pawn on e5. I could take on e4 with my knight, threatening f2, but I prefer...} Qd4 {Qd4! I threaten mate on f2, the knight on e5 and the pawn on e4.} 7. Nd3 {White chooses the lesser of three evils.} Qxe4+ 8. Qe2 {Pins my queen, so I can't take the rook on h1.} Qxe2+ 9. Kxe2 {Queens swapped, black definitely has the better position, as white cannot castle, and is down on development.} Bb6 {I retreat the bishop out of harms way, but I should have gone to d6. b6 loses a piece eventually, as the bichop can't retreat any further.} 10. b3 {My opponent plans to fianchetto his DSB, rather than moving the knight and then the pawn on the d-file. This also sets him up for a Q-side attack.} O-O {I castle, to get my king out of the way and to get the rook involved down the e-file. Perhaps I should have played a6 or a5, to give my Bishop an escape square.} 11. Bb2 Nd5 {?? Not sure why I did this, it just loses a piece.} 12. c4 {! The knight is attacked, and when it moves, c5 and then b4 are fatal for my bishop.} Re8+ 13. Kd1 Bxf2 {I choose to keep my knight, as the bishop is rather trapped, and win a pawn for the sacrifice.} 14. Nxf2 Ne7 {I'm now 2 points down and my opponent has a good position. Its amazing what a few moves can do to a game of chess.} 15. Re1 {Trying to get his rook involved with a pin on my knight. I probably would have played Nc3, Kc2, Rae1, Kc1 then Rhf1, but this can give him a good position also.} Bf5 {Develop my last minor piece and remove the pin on my knight.} 16. Nc3 {Bringing the knight into the action.} Rad8 {Rook on an open file towards the enemy king.} 17. Ba3 {Trying to win the knight, but this is easily parried.} Ng6 18. Rxe8+ Rxe8 {Swap of rooks, but I gain the open file.} 19. g4 {Forcing me back, but weakening the pawn, as white doesn't want to then play h3, which is a loss of tempo and creates a backward h-pawn.} Be6 {Blocks the open file, but only momentarily.} 20. Kc2 {White now attempts to castle the old-fashioned way.} a5 {I begin an attack with my pawns.} 21. Nd3 {The knight comes over to defend, but has forgotten its duty to defend the g-pawn.} Bxg4 {Now only one point down, but with a King-side pawn majority, and a passed pawn on the f-file.} 22. Nc5 {Not much of a threat.} b6 23. Nc5e4 {I can now pin his knight, and gain back some advantage.} Bf5 24. Re1 {The knight is now pinned to 2 pieces. If he plays Kd1, white threatens a discovered attack on my rook.} Re6 {I defend my rook, removing any ideas of the discovered attack.} 25. d3 {He removes one pin, and defends the knight again.} Nh4 {Threatening Nf3.} 26. Kd2 {?? I now win back the piece, and have the advantage in the endgame with my K-side pawn majority.} Nf3+ 27. Kd1 Nxe1 {Gobble, thanks for the rook.} 28. Kxe1 Bxe4 {I trade off pieces. This also wins me a pawn.} 29. dxe4 f5 {Yet another pin!} 30. Bc1 {White is planning to bring his bishop to f4 to try to break through my pawns on the Q-side.} fxe4 {Gobble, another pawn.} 31. Bf4 Re7 {Defends both pawns at once.} 32. Ke2 {:( The e4 pawn is going to be lost.} c5 {I try to lock up the Q-side, but thsi just puts all my pawns on black squares, where his bishop will wreak havoc.} 33. Nd5 {Winning the c7 pawn, after which my entire Q-side will fall.} Re6 {I plan to manoeuver around the back with my rook.} 34. Bxc7 Rh6 {I didn't realize that the pawn is protected by the bishop. Better would be Rg6.} 35. Nxb6 {ARGH!!! My pawns are being massacred.} Kf7 {The king coems across to try to help.} 36. Na4 {2 more pawns under attack. I'm having fears of losing now.} g5 {Beginning the counter attack on the opposite side. I plan to over-run the poor lonely h2 pawn.} 37. Nxc5 {Oh dear, now my opponent has a passed pawn.} Rc6 {But I have a piece. A lovely fork, which wins me a piece and with it, probably the game (unless I make a huge mistake, which is very likley)} 38. Nxe4 {He chooses to win some pawns for his piece.} Rxc7 {I rather scared of a knight fork on my K and R now.} 39. Nxg5+ {Another pawn gone, but I have a rook, so I should at minimum be able to draw. However, I want to win, and I should from here.} Kg6 {Defend the h-pawn, and force the knight to retreat.} 40. Nf3 h5 {When in doubt, push a pawn.} 41. Kf2 {The king decides to help on the K-side. } Rb7 {I now try to cruch his q-side pawns, just like he did to mine.} 42. Kg3 {King hides from the check on the 2nd row after 42....a4 43. bxa4 Rb2+, which wions me all the pawns. I need to be careful though, the c4 pawn is actually protected, because of the fork that would result.} a4 {I go ahead with my plan anyway.} 43. b4 {My opponent decides to push, which loses the pawns as well.} Rxb4 {Gobble. It was at this point I wrote a game note to myself saying:  DON'T TAKE THE PAWN ON C4!!!} 44. c5 {He tries to trick me into playing Rc4, which wins it.} Rb2 {No such luck. Here my opponent timed-out. Whether that was their way of resigning, or if they just forgot, I don't know. Thank you for the game nfr-932, I enjoyed it.  This game shows the importance of pins and forks in the game, and that one bad move can change a game from a winning position to a lost one very quickly. Thanks for reading, please rate and comment.}
