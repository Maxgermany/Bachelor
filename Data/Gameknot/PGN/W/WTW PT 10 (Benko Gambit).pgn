1. d4 c5 2. d5 Nf6 3. c4 b5 4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 Bxa6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Nf3 g6 8. e4 {Pretty much on track to here.} Bg7 {During the course of the game, I thought this is where I messed up. I think should have traded bishops with him. I didn't realized the order was so critical. Analysis confirms this move was a mistake.} 9. e5 {This was one of the problems. I was trying to maintain my pawn chain. Not sure how to avoid this scenario.} Ng4 10. Bxa6 {My hesitation costs me the ability to keep him from castling.} Nxf2 {So I give up the knight, to keep him from castling. If the queen side attack can still happen, I don't want him on the other side of the board. In hindsight, this was not a good choice.} 11. Kxf2 Rxa6 12. exd6 O-O 13. Bg5 Qxd6 14. Re1 Rb6 15. Bxe7 {Working to recognize forks in advance, clearly not there yet.} Rxb2+ 16. Re2 {He pins his rook for me. Phew.} Qxe7 17. Rxb2 Bxc3 18. Re2 Qd8 19. Rc1 Bb2 20. Rxb2 Na6 21. Qa4 Nb4 22. Ne5 Qxd5 23. Re1 {I see the possible fork at Nd3, but his e5 knight is defending that space.} Qd4+ 24. Kf3 Qxb2 25. Qb5 Qc3+ 26. Kf2 {This is where it dawned on me he might not see the potential fork.} Rb8 {Analysis calls this a blunder, but I think this was a pretty good move. He'll capture and then I move my king in between my pawns, a Kg4 move will box my king in. If he doesn't see the fork, Kg4 will be very attractive to white. I gambled and....} 27. Qxb8+ Kg7 28. Ng4 {...it pays off! (Note: My wife asked me what was wrong when I screamed out "YES!)} Nd3+ 29. Kg3 {Surprised me he didn't move Ke2, but I'll take it.} Nxe1+ 30. Kf4 Nxg2+ {I found a mate path from here. I just need him to move...} 31. Kg5 {There!!} Qd2+ 32. Ne3 Qxe3+ 33. Kg4 h5# {I really enjoyed the opportunity Porcho! Thanks for setting up the mini tournament.}
