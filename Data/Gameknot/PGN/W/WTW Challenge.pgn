[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 {Of course, the usual.} e6 {Now, I lost the chat from the beginning.  Meaning: That most did not save.  But, I remember ION telling me that he doesn't play the French Defense that often and would like to try something different.  Since I'm not very familiar with it and there's a lot to learn, given that now, I've become good at playing the Caro Kann, and other defenses, but not the French, and after having some bad luck including my game against geniusacamel and blitzkov but during the misstep which just wasn't a good game at all, I realize that there is a lot to learn.  Remember: learning more things means that there's just so much you don't know.  So, as part of the theory, I wanted to get better at playing against this defense.  Therefore, I told archduke that it isn't a problem, and I like the defense as there's more for me to learn.  So, it was game on.} 2. d4 {Of course, I finally remembered the best response.  As it's said when the opponent responds to 1.e4 by advancing one pawn, best is 2.d4  I like going by this model to since it's a central, and henceforth, a developing move to open lines for the B, and that you need those central files to control the center.} b6 {Deciding to fianchetto.  Interesting.  But, in my mind, not the best.  From what myevilluck told me in the WTWLTR when he was a mentor, and then what this opponent previously taught me in other annotations, fianchettoing generally isn't the best idea because it'll often waste a tempo, when you could have developed the B right then and there since that e pawn has advanced.  So, the idea would be to bring it out right then and there.  Of course, the more moves black makes, the more I'm learning because there's more things to get used to and then adjust so that you remember that there can be a lot of possibilities, and sometimes variations to an opening or defense.  What I learned then, is that there are also several variations to the French.} 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. Bd3 d6 5. O-O {Of course, the idea is castle early and often.  Now, usually what's important is that you know how there are exceptions to that guideline.  From what I've noticed, this happens a lot with strong players.  A good example was against jstevens1 where I castled right into the attack and then wound up in trouble.  So, this is where you really have to evaluate which is good as it's part of doing that HW.  But, here, in this position, I saw that castling would not cause any immediate problems, so I just went for it since K safety is essential.} Nd7 6. Nc3 g6 7. Be3 {Not only completing development, but another idea with this move is a strong B pair.  The idea is that since they're both in the center with N's, it's well coordinated, so the center is well controlled.  The idea, from what I learned is that for the center to be controlled, not only do you need the pieces out, but everything has to coordinated in the center.  Like, hear, the line up is with the B's, and both N's placed right next to each B.  That was my plan right after castling.  What I just didn't realize is how quick I could do it because, usually, there are exceptions shortly after castling that a pawn or piece is threatened and then you must protect it, but not in this position.} Bg7 8. b4 Ne7 9. Qd2 h6 10. a3 Rc8 11. Rfd1 c5 {? This is a mistake according to the computer, and my coach said the same thing.  In it he said this but towards the end.  However, it applies here.  What he said was, ..." my 11th move was a straight-out blunder. The odd thing about it was that my immediate thought on seeing 11.Rc1 was "well, 11...c5 is unplayable." So why I played it (after thinking about what else to play) I can not explain to myself..."  This is also where he complimented and said that I'm doing extremely well, so far and have not made any mistakes, yet.  And, ironically they outline that this would've been best six moves, earlier.  The reason is because of what I do next.  My plan, now that I've completed development is to make a threat that will be difficult to drive off, so no cheapo tactics.  The real plan was to win a pawn.  So, best, is according to what it shows is 11...g5  Then, the proper continuation would be 12.Qe2, 0-0 13.h3, Ra8 14.a4, Nc6 15.b5, Nb4 16.Bc4, Nf6 17.Rab1, a5 18.d5, Qe7 19.dxe6, fxe6} 12. Nb5 {The idea here wasn't to win the R, as I know he has ways to defend.  The reason behind this move, is that he's going to lose a pawn one way or another.  That was actually why I played this.  So, the idea was take on d6 or on a7.} cxd4 {? This is a mistake because of what I play next.   Now, what I thought he'd play was 12...Rc6, which was the anticipated move, and computer outlines as the best.  But, then, I'd take with 13.Nxa7  And, the proper follow up would be 13...Rc7 14.Nb5, Rc6 15.c4, Qb8 16.e5, cxd4 17.Nfxd4, Bxe5 18.Nxc6, Bxc6 19.Nc3  But, with this move, black's in trouble after what I play.  The real idea was to take away black's opportunity to castle which is what I achieve here.  And, as ION pointed the mistake did not happen here.  } 13. Nxd6+ Kf8 14. Bxd4 {! I thought this was the blunder worthy of ?? only because of what I thought ION outlined. Actually, what he said is that this move is on the money.   However, I was not going to take right away on c8  because by protecting my B, the idea is to take on g7 with the same piece, which will happen.  My intention was to expose black's K, so by doing that, I feel that black has a weakness which I'm exploiting since K safety is extremely important.  Where had I taken now, I'd be stuck with a weakness, right after.  And, black would have the advantage, immediately.   } Qc7 15. Bxg7+ Kxg7 16. Nb5 {?? According to the analysis, which I agree, this is a mistake, but not for the same reason.  The computer outlines 16.Be2 as the best move, but that's wrong.  And, as ION put it, this is the losing blunder.  And, this is the move that he alluded to.   The reason I didn't play this is that there is also a saying, that, "To take is a mistake."  One time, I had a somewhat similar position, in my game against easy19.  He had a R en-prise and I took it.  By doing so, I lost because the K was exposed.  I thought that would happen later on if I played that because I was worried that there was a potential, though, not an immediate threat that the Q would come down and the d pawn would advance and create problems around the K.  That, however, is not the case.  Instead, this is where I missed the opportunity win a R for a N with 16.Nxc8! which was best.  Playing that would have left black clinging, as he put it.  But, the reason that I did not make that move  is because I still thought that to taking would be a costly mistake.  The reason I played this was not to win a Q or the a pawn, which it appears; as I wouldn't make that move just for that against a player like ION because it would be unsound and would be refuted.  The real idea was to prevent black from making threats with his Q.  If I took the R, after taking back  I thought because I analyzed and based on my assessment I believe that black would've played 17...g5, and would keep advancing the g and h pawns and keep them connected, and then the Q would come down and pose as a threat to white.  I didn't want to allow that, so the idea is that in order to protect both the a pawn and Q, and after asking what he could do, the only option is what he plays next.  And, by keeping that Q on b8 the structure around my K is safe, for now.  } Qb8 17. Qe3 Rhd8 18. Rac1 a6 19. Nbd4 Nf6 20. h3 Rc3 21. Nd2 Rxa3 22. Rca1 {The analysis gives this an inaccuracy.  Best was 22.Nc4  22...Ra4 23.c3, Ra2 24.Nxb6, Nxe4 25.Bb1, Ra1 26.f3, Ng3 27.Nd7, Qc7 28.Ne5, Kg8 29.c4  I disagree with the analysis.  And, as we know, sometimes, the analysis is wrong.  I feel that this is so.  The reason I'm not going by it is that I don't why they're suggesting these moves, so there not as much theory to understand since theory is the why questions.  Having said that, I think this is best, and that's why I played it.  The idea is we will exchange immediately.  And, as noted, the idea is exchange when up against a stronger opponent.} Rxa1 23. Rxa1 Qd6 24. c3 {The idea behind this was to achieve a solid pawn structure, or pawn chain.  But, this isn't a good move, at all. ?? Computer gives it as a mistake, but after what they outline, I view it as a blunder, not just a mistake.  The idea now is that with best play from white, I'm going to lose a piece for a pawn, after his next move.  Best, was 24.N4f3  24...Qxb4 25.Rb1, Qc3 26.Qxb6, Rd7 27.Rb3, Qc6 28.e5, Nfd5 29.Qd4, Kg8 30.Qh4, Nf5 31.Bxf5, exf5 32.Qxh6, Qxc2 and everything is still even.} e5 25. Nc4 {? Ok, the idea here, why I played this was to protect my N on d4.  I figured that, now, I'm in trouble after the use of Analyze the Board.  But, I thought this move would bail me out.  Terrible miscalculation on my part.  And, I saw ahead and anticipated what happened, but there was another defender that I overlooked, this time, his R.  With that, this backfired what I had analyzed.  No matter he's going to be 2 points ahead, but this move, loses another pawn.  Having said all of that, best was 25.Qe1  25...Nh5 26.Nc4, Qf6 27.Nxe5, Qxe5 28.Bxa6, Qxe4 29.Bxb7, Qxb7 30.Qe5+, Nf6 31.Qg3, Ned5 32.Nf5+, Kh7 33.Nd6} exd4 26. Nxd6 dxe3 27. e5 exf2+ {?! Mistake, according to the computer, but I give it, however, as an inaccuracy.  The idea is to promote the pawn, of course.  And, usually, that's how it happens, with no way to stop it.  But, that's not so here because he doesn't have anything right in front.  Generally speaking, it's the R, which is where putting the behind a promote that is to promote, will often guarantee the win.  However, with nothing behind, I am going to take it, and get a little compensation for lost material.  At least, for now.  Having said that, best was 27...Ne8 28.Nxb7, Rxd3 29.fxe3, Rd7 30.Nd6, Nxd6 31.exd6, Rxd6 32.e4, b5 33.Kf2, Rd2+ 34.Kf3, Rd3+ 35.Kf4, g5+ 36.Kg4, Nc6 37.Rxa6, Rxc3  } 28. Kxf2 Ne8 29. Nxe8+ Rxe8 30. g4 {?? Ok, I did consider 30.Bxa6, but I thought he'd take back and now would win a piece for a pawn, in addition to what I lost.  So, instead, I moved the g pawn to strengthen those pawn structures because, as I learned in the Deeper Chess Theory Club, you want to try an connect those pawns.  However, given that I'm lost, I think creatively in order to avoid getting overwhelmed and stressed as that makes the situation and where I make more mistakes.  In fact, this is something to that hindered my progress, back in the day.  However, what I overlooked was my R on a1, so the best move then was to just take, winning something back.  But, this move, however, prevents the compensation, and in fact, loses, yet, another pawn, after what black plays next.} Nd5 31. Be4 Rxe5 32. Bf3 Bc8 33. c4 {? Ok, not only was the move a mistake, but I did not have a good attitude here.  And, it typically happens, when I finally realize that I'm fault.  Remember how I learned that unsound aggression and cheapo tactics aren't good, unless you're lost and know your opponent can go wrong if they're not careful.  They'll likely see the threat so you do just about anything to stay in.  It's called a defeatistic attitude, which is sometimes, the wrong approach.  My idea is that, since I had absolutely nothing else to lose, I'll do anything to stay in.  So, I decide to march right after his ION's because once he moved I'd have tempo and could, maybe, get counterplay.  That's not so.  This kind of thing also happened in my game against Jack, about two weeks ago.  I was at a disadvantage and nearly lost, so I tried anything to stay in.  That time, I went for an easy to drive off mate threat, knowing that he had a strong edge.  I figured that I was lost, and so, there was nothing else to lose.  But, I had to think defensively, as opposed to, aggressively.  He said that had I done that, the game might have still ended in a draw.  But, the approach I took lost instantly.  So, the idea is that no matter how bad the situation, even if you're lost, sometimes you have to think defensively, as opposed to, aggressively.  This is now something that I emphasize to students because I realize that this is a common where sometimes you're aggressive because you're lost, but thinking, defensively is what you have to do instead.  And, the way to remember it is what pawntificator said in the WTWLTR, which is not to have a defeatistic attitude because, as we know, it's not over, until it's over.  Having said all of that, this move loses, yet, another pawn.  So, without further adue, best was 33.Rd1, in this position.  33...Be6 34.Bxd5, Rxd5 35.Ra1, Rd3 36.Rxa6, Rxh3 37.Rxb6, Rxc3 38.b5, Bxg4 39.Rc6, Rf3+ 40.Kg1, Bd7 41.Rc5} Nxb4 34. Rb1 a5 35. Rd1 Be6 36. Rd6 Bxc4 37. Rxb6 Nd3+ 38. Kg3 a4 39. h4 a3 40. Rc6 {?? The ultimate blunder.  Yes, the game was lost, but this loses immediately, however.  The idea here, since I make that mistake of being aggressive, rather then, defensive, is march right after the B.  I know he won't allow it, but now, even if, "To take is a mistake", I do so anyway since the position is dire.  Normally, this is where I used to resign, given that the a pawn is going to promote with no way to stop it.  But, first, wrecking_ball emphasizes never to resign, even with the promotion because you don't know.  On one or two occasions, on smaller scales, though, he's been put in situations similar to this, but played on and win when all hope was, more or less, gone.  And, I had a very similar position in my game against Jack, last week.  Though, we both had both the R's.  But, the same idea.  After blundering away a piece, within the first ten moves, he was ahead a pawn and a piece.  But, this time, with two passed pawns.  One very nearly promoted.  I was black, so his pawn was on the third rank, then.  So, that's lost, generally speaking.  But, against all odds, he made a mistake, allowing me to skewer his R.  So, when I placed him in check, I got that R back.  And, after that, white could no longer win, so I was able to draw in what was a hopelessly lost position.  So, as GM JP outlines, ..."Fight til it's over."   It's also because when I did the WTW games, I didn't and still don't follow just those rules which says you can resign when you think you're lost.  Instead, I follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk which is the equivalent to the original WTW rules, you don't resign until mate is inevitable.  I like that rule, and generally will follow it.  With it, the reason this loses instantly now, is that, with best play, black has a mate in 8.  So, best was 40.Rb7 40...a2 41.Ra7, Re3 42.Kg2, Ne1+ 43.Kf2, Rxf3+ 44.Kxe1, Rf6 45.Ra5, Ra6 46.Rxa2, Rxa2 47.h5, f5 48.gxf5, Re2+ 49.Kf1, gxf5  } a2 41. Rxc4 {?? There's only way to stop an immediate promotion, 41.Rc6  But, even so, black answers with 41.Nc5  So, it'll promote sooner or later, that's before I found out that black actually had mate.  So, at this point, I regained a little confidence back, and seeing how lost I was, given that he'd promote, anyway, I decided to take his B since there be one less thing that black has.  Big mistake though, as after black promotes, it'll be mate in 4.  So, best was to play the immediate 41.Ra6} a1=Q 42. Kg2 Qa2+ 43. Kh3 Qf2 44. Bc6 Re3+ {Seeing that black has a mate in one because the K is stuck and can't move, so the only option is 44.Bf6, after which comes 44...Rxf3#, I resign, at this point.  In order to prevent this, the K would've had to escape, and I've studied similar positions with GM games.  What I learned here is to ask yourself when taking is a mistake.  Sometimes, even against much stronger players, that isn't so.  And, in some cases, no matter how bad the situation, even if you think or are lost, it's important to think defensively, as opposed to, aggressively.  Overall, I would like to thank archduke_piccolo for giving me this game.}
