1. e4 {There has been much analysis since Bobby Fischer's time regarding a King's pawn (e4) vs. a Queen's pawn (d4) opening.  The numbers seem to give 'd4' a slight edge, but I like Fischer's playing style and he felt the King's pawn opening was 'best by test'.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Petrov's Defense.} 3. Nc3 Bd6 {3 ... Bd6 looks like a mistake.  It appears to protect the e5 pawn, although Nc6 (Four Knight's Game) does a better job of it since it doesn't block the advance of black's Queen pawn.  How to take advantage of Black's misplay?} 4. Bc4 Nc6 5. O-O {Protecting the King before breaking open the center.} b6 {It appears black is looking to fianchetto his bishop.  He can currently kingside castle, but he will need two more moves if he'd like to queenside castle, and I'd rather not allow him options...} 6. d4 {Challenging the center.} exd4 7. Nxd4 Bb7 {The expected fianchetto.  The only place for black's Queen is e7 if he would like to retreat the King to the queenside.} 8. Nf5 {This proves to be the critical move of the game.  It keeps the Queen from developing to e7, and black's dark square Bishop has stifled his ability to open space with a Queen's pawn push.  This move also targets the weak g7 square.  But what I like most about this move is it prepares to take away black's ability to castle...} Be5 {It appears black thought I was looking to exchange my Knight for his Bishop.  Perhaps he did not want to ruin his queenside pawn structure because he plans to castle queenside?} 9. Nxg7+ {The real knife in the side.  Black now has all of his forces solidified for queenside protection, but unfortunately the king will not be joining them anytime soon.} Kf8 {Getting out of check and attacking the Knight.} 10. Bh6 {Bringing more forces into the attack and cementing the Knight.  } Kg8 {Moving out of a discovered check.} 11. Nf5 {Removing a Queen move to the e7 square and opening the door for the White queen to finish the job on g4.  The lone black Knight on f6 keeps mate from happening.  What to do about him?} Ne7 {Trying to bring some pieces to the King's defense.} 12. Nxe7+ {Trading down to keep the black Knight off of the g6 square, but allowing the Queen to move a little closer to the action.} Qxe7 13. Nd5 {Attacking the Knight.  Another option was Bishop to d5, but white's Bishop is currently very strong on this diagonal.} Bxd5 14. Bxd5 c6 {At this point I thought long and hard about my next move.  If I retreat the Bishop, black can make a push with his d-pawn to d5, gaining space and some counterplay.  So instead...} 15. f4 {f4!  This move does weaken the King's defense slightly, but I have three powerful pieces currently along the back rank, and the real intention is to bring the Rook on f1 to bear.  If black captures the pawn on f4 with his Bishop, then Rook takes Bishop, gains material and dangerous mating chances.  } cxd5 16. Rf3 {The Rook lift brings another piece into the fight.} Nh5 {Black needs to protect a quick mate along the g-file, as well as open up lines of activity for his Queen.} 17. Rg3+ Ng7 {Correct.  17...Nxg3 loses to 18. Qg4+ Bg7  19. Qxg7#} 18. fxe5 {Removing a key defender.} Qc5+ {I'm not sure this move does much.  I saw the potential earlier from both the black Bishop and the Queen, and I still feel my King is safe for the time being moving to the h1 square.  This move also takes the Queen away from her King's much needed defense...} 19. Kh1 Kf8 {Trying to escape.} 20. Bxg7+ {Supported by the Rook on g3.  } Ke7 {20... Kg8 loses to 21. Bh6#.  I can trade one of my key pieces (Bishop) for a inactive Rook, but can I do better?} 21. Bf6+ {This forces the King to the back rank, allowing me to take the Rook on h8 for free.  21... Ke6 loses to 22. Qg4#} Ke8 22. Bxh8 Qc6 {Finally bringing the Queen back towards the action, although perhaps f8 might have suited her better?  It looks like she may also be trying to protect the Rook on a8 from a check from white's Rook on g8.} 23. Rg8+ {Peeling the black King off of the back rank.} Ke7 24. Bf6+ {This move wins the Queen.  After 24...Qxf6 25. exf6.} Ke6 {Mistake.  Mate in 1.} 25. Qg4# {}
