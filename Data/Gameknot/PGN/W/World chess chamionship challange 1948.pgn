Qxc4 O-O 7. e4 Bg4 {the idea of blacks 7....Bg4 is to act vs White's center with his pieces instead of his pawns .this way makes interesting dilemma in the modern chess strategy.} 8. Be3 Nfd7 9. Qb3 Nb6 10. a4 a5 11. d5 Bxf3 12. gxf3 Qd6 {good move , the black queen on d6 is in very good position , which it attendedto move to b4 and pressure on the white's queen side.} 13. Nb5 Qb4+ 14. Qxb4 axb4 15. Nxc7 {if the white moved 15.a5 so black answered 15...Bxb2.16.Rb1-Na4!(16.Ra2-Be5.17.f4-Bd6.18.e5-b3! with complications however better chances for black ).} Rxa4 16. Rb1 {white keeps his rook to defend the queen side . its not good idea to 16.Rxa4-Nxa4.17.b3-Nc3.18.Bh3-Be5.19.Bb6-Na6.20.Nxa6-Ra8!! with very good position for black.} Nb6d7 17. Nb5 Rc8 18. Be2 {maybe it was better for white play 18.Nd4 first , with the idea after 18...b3.19.Nxb3-Rb4.20.Nd2 with equal chances for both sides .} b3 19. Na3 {not 19.0-0-Rc2.20.Bd1-Rxb2 and black won a free pawn because if.21. Bxd3?-Rb4 and black win a piece.} Bxb2 20. Rxb2 Rxa3 21.

Nxe6 25. Be3 Ndc5 26. Bxc5 {the bishops pare didnt show any advantage over the  knights pare, there for white moving to passive defense.} Nxc5 27. Kc3 Ra4 {black doesn't seduced to give discovered check 27...Na4+because of 28.Kb4!} 28. Kd2 Kg7 {good positional move , the blac king will play on the dark sqaures to avoid any dangere for b3 pawn ,i mean that the LSB wont give any check on the king and attack with the tow rooks the b3 pawn in the future .} 29. Ke3 Rd8 30. Rc1 b6 31. Bc4 Rda8 32. Bd5 Ra4a2 33. Rcb1 Ra8a4 34. Kd2 Rd4+ 35. Ke2 Na4 36. Rxa2 bxa2 37.
