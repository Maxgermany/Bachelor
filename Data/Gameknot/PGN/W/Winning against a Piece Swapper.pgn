[Opening "Old Benoni defence (A43)"]

1. d4 {White opens with the Queen's pawn.} c5 {If dxc5, then Black can regain the pawn with Qa5+. Black can also play e6, gambiting the pawn.} 2. c3 {a weak move} cxd4 3. cxd4 d5 {The position is equal already. Now Black will play for the advantage.} 4. e3 {Another weak move that locks in the darksquared bishop.} Bf5 5. Bd3 {The first exchange} Qc8 6. Bxf5 Qxf5 7. f4 {White gains control over e5, but g3 and e3 are weakened.} Nf6 8. Nf3 e6 9. O-O Nbd7 10. Nbd2 Rc8 11. Qa4 a6 12. Ne5 {White's plan is not to keep the knight on e5, but actually to swap knights.} Qc2 13. Qxc2 {T} Rxc2 {The Queens have been swapped.} 14. Nxd7 Nxd7 {That's the third pair of swapping.} 15. Nf3 Bd6 16. Rf2 {White tries to swap rooks now, but Black doesn't want to exchange in this position, else he loses control of the c-file.} Rc4 17. b3 Rc7 {Perhaps black should have played Rc7 immediately instead of wasting a tempo. However, the text creates darksquare weaknesses.} 18. Bb2 O-O 19. Rff1 {Black should have played Rc2 here.} Rfc8 {Instead Black doubles up on the c-file.} 20. Rac1 {White offers to exchange rooks again.} Rc7c2 21. Rxc2 {White had no other moves. If the c1 Rook moves away, then ... Rxb2, capturing the bishop and if Ba1??, then ... Rxc1 winning a whole rook.} Rxc2 22. Rf2 {Another attempt to swap rooks} Rc8 23. Kf1 {White probably plans to move his king to d1 or d3 and then try swapping rooks again.} Nf6 24. h3 {But there's nothing defending the e4 square.} Ne4 {Now Black loses huge material.} 25. Re2 Ng3+ 26. Kf2 Nxe2 27. Kxe2 Rc2+ {That was a quick win.}
