1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {Closed Sicilan} e6 3. f4 Nc6 {Transposing into the Grand Prix attack.} 4. Nf3 d5 5. Bb5 Nf6 6. Bxc6+ {I consider this move to be weak as it only strengthens my center and trades off whites good bishop for a knight.} bxc6 7. e5 {Making the center static.  Not sure if this really does much for either side however it does allow white King side attacking chances with the f5 break.} Nd7 8. O-O Ba6 9. d3 Rb8 10. b3 {Not a bad choice as it settles the issue of how to develop the c1 bishop.} Be7 11. Re1 {Not sure I think much of this move however it does relieve the pin of the d3 pawn.} O-O 12. Bb2 {Here is we move into the middle game.  I've got a powerful center however I'd consider my pieces less active than the white ones.  The problem I have here is how to get my pieces into the action.  I decide it would be best for me to relieve myself of these doubled pawns and open up my bishops' diagonals.} c4 13. dxc4 Bxc4 {As strange as this move looks it is perfectly playable.  If white should play bxc4 Rxb2 black should have a clear advantage.} 14. Nd4 {This move centralizes the white knight and shows whites activity.  Black must look at how to avoid Nxc6.  I've got two options I can pin the knight or defend the pawn.  I think Bc5 is playable but I went with the other playable option Qc7 because of the pressure to e5.} Qc7 15. f5 {I have the option of play Nxe5 here.  I didn't really notice this move at the time but I feel that lining up my knight with the b2 bishop might be a bad thing.} exf5 {?! this probably not as good as Nxe5 because white can play Nxf5 and the knight now has a great position as everything is aimed at g7.} 16. e6 {?! better is Nxf5.} Nc5 17. exf7+ Rxf7 18. Ba3 {Forcing my c4 bishop to move and put pressure on e7.} Ba6 19. Kh1 {?! This moves off the checking diagonal but really doesn't do anything for whites game.  In fact it opens up back rank mating opportunities for black which is in fact how I end up winning this game.  } Ne4 {Forcing the trade of knights due to Nf2+ and Bxa3.} 20. Nxe4 fxe4 {My pawns now look great and should be a long term advantage for me.} 21. Bxe7 Rxe7 {Okay know I need to find a way to get my bad bishop working for me rather then just being stuck on a6.  Be nice if I can force a trade.  Abstractly if I could take my a6 bishop off the board for his d4 knight my game looks winning.} 22. Re3 Rf8 {Stacking up on the f-file.} 23. Qg4 {Moving the queen to a better square and removing the threat of Rf1+.} Ref7 {Now threatening the back rank mate.} 24. Ree1 Qe5 {This forces c3 which my opponent missed I was planning on trying to induce my trade by forcing the knight to retreat to e2 where I can take it with my bishop.  After c3 Rf6 my plan was to get in c5.} 25. Nxc6 {?? loses to Qxa1} Qxa1 {White resigns.  I'm fairly positive that mate is unavoidable at this point but I would be hard pressed to consider all possibilities.  }
