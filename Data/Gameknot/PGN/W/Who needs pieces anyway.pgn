[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 h6 2. e4 g5 3. Nf3 a6 {White has developed normally: occupying the centre with his pawns, developing a knight. Black, by contrast, has played the rare Global Opening, developed by IM Michael Basman. This can be played against pretty much any opening by White or Black, and is aimed at controlling and expanding on the wings.} 4. h4 {White diverts from his plan of occupying the centre and developing. Clearly something must be done about those over-eager Black kingside pawns. This choice of move forces Black to react on the kingside, before 5.hxg5 wins a pawn due to the pin on Black's h-pawn. The downside is that Black can lock the kingside up, and consolidate his hold on space, immediately.} g4 {! This grabs a lot of space, with tempo as White's knight must move.} 5. Ne5 h5 {White's knight takes up an unstable position in the centre of the board, in Black's side, in order to threaten Black's advanced kingside pawns immediately, as well as pressurise the weak f7-pawn. Black, for his part, quickly shores up his space advantage and his g-pawn. However, this does not catch up in development! My IM chess teacher would kill ME if I did what Black is doing...but a GM can get away with it...hmmmmm...} 6. Bc4 {White logically decides that his best chance against White's slow development is to highlight this disadvantage by developing quickly, and gaining another tempo with an attack on Black's f7-pawn.} e6 {Blunting the bishop's powerful line, and preparing for ...d5 with tempo. ...b5 also works, and is probably better.} 7. Nc3 b5 {! Grabbing a space advantage on the other wing, the queenside, and gaining a tempo as Black shoves back White's bishop.} 8. Bb3 {Here we can probably see the shadow of Black's future trap. White's light-squared bishop is trapped, and isn't going anywhere anytime soon.} d6 {Preparing for another space-grab with ...c5!, and gaining another tempo. 8...b4 also looks good, but this releases White's light-squared bishop.} 9. Nd3 c5 {!! A lovely move. Here, the beauty of this position is demonstrated. White is ahead on development by 3 pieces to 0, has established a classical pawn centre, has done everything the opening manuals tell us to do...but he is lost! Black's pawns control much more space than White's pieces do: White's pieces, for all their development, are immobile and sitting ducks. If Andre Dani Philidor had seen this, he would have pointed out to us, "There you go. I told you that pawns are the soul of chess". White's pieces are unable to prevent an eventual ...c5, which wins a minor piece.} 10. dxc5 dxc5 11. a4 c4 {As IM Malcolm Pein, in the Daily Telegraph chess column, said, "Resigning was objectively best here but White must have been in shock. So, that's where I'll leave it.}
