1. e4 {Hi all! This is my first finished game from the WTW Welcome Mini-Tournament Group 3. Obviously I'm not a Master or even Expert, but as I had the White pieces it's my honor to do the annotation, and if any Masters stop by to comment I'd definitely appreciate it. It's not a perfect game by any means but hopefully everyone can find something of use within. Here goes!} e5 {The oldest[citation needed] of openings!} 2. f4 {The King's Gambit is one of my favorite openings, on both sides of the board. I think it leads to fun and interesting play.} d6 {Personally I think accepting the Gambit (2...exf4) is better. Then it's up to White to prove he can get something for the pawn!} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Bc4 Nf6 {Both sides begin quick development.} 5. Nc3 Nb4 {? This blunders a pawn! Now White can play 6.fxe5 dxe5 7.Nxe5 and come out a clear pawn ahead, with a big central advantage and an attack on f7.} 6. d3 {White chooses to take the tempo rather than the material. Now Black should give up his central presence to maintain equality with 6...exf4 7.Bxf4 Be7.} b6 {? Black's DSB could easily have been developed to g4, and his e-pawn is still hanging! As I said above, best was 6...exf4.} 7. fxe5 dxe5 8. Nxe5 {White comes away a pawn to the good, and he's threatening a very disruptive check on f7.} Be6 {This is essentially Black's only good move. There's no other way to adequately defend f7.} 9. Bxe6 fxe6 10. a3 {White exchanges Bishops to give Black a weak, isolated e-pawn, and to further weaken the vulnerable light squares a6 and c6. It's worth mentioning that White is not devoid of weaknesses--his Ne5 is undefended and he has no claim at all to the d4 square.} Na6 {An ugly place for a Knight, but it has a view of c5 and it didn't have anywhere else to go, anyway.} 11. O-O {? Terrible! White hands over a significant material advantage. I think (the computer agrees) that the best choice was 11.d4, or perhaps 11.Be3. Black now has a simple tactic that wins a piece...} Bd6 {? But this isn't it! Correct was 11...Qd4+! 12.Kh1 Qxe5, coming away with a free Knight.} 12. Nc6 Qd7 13. Nd4 {? Again White overlooks Black's chances along the c5-g1 diagonal. Now 13...Bc5 pins the Knight to the White King, winning it for nothing!} Be5 {? And again Black misses the tactic as well. As I said, 13...Bc5 was the correct choice here. Now the Knight can escape with no trouble.} 14. Nf3 Bd4+ 15. Kh1 O-O-O {Black has finally consolidated a bit. He still has a weak e-pawn, but there's no direct threat at the moment and the file isn't open. He's also leading White in development. White, for his part, has far fewer pawn weaknesses (look at all the weak light squares around the Black King for comparison!) and slightly better central presence.} 16. Nxd4 {Out of White's 16 moves, six of them have been this Knight! It's no wonder he's behind in development. The thought behind this move is simple: White exchanges his Knight for the strong Bishop and draws the BQ to the center of the board, where she'll be easy to harass. Getting rid of the Bishop makes White's dark-square weaknesses easier to defend--important because he has yet to develop his dark Bishop!} Qxd4 17. Qe2 {White prepares to connect his Rooks, bolsters e3 in preparation for a Bishop that might want to land there, and takes aim at Black's undefended Knight from behind the d3 pawn.} h5 {The players have castled to opposite sides of the board, which usually means whoever gets a pawn storm going first has a big attacking advantage.} 18. Bg5 {White finally develops this Bishop and momentarily pins the Black Knight.} Rdf8 {The obvious response is a good one.} 19. Be3 {White's not about to give his opponent a free battery on the open file by exchanging on f6, so instead he repositions with tempo, aiming at the Black castle.} Qe5 {? This is too aggressive; better was ...Qd7. In the text, Black takes aim at h2 (perhaps contemplating a follow-up with ...Ng4), but his Queen is too easy to chase around here in the center. White has his pick of harassing options, but the best by far is...} 20. d4 {! Jabbing at the BQ as well as discovering the Queen's attack on the Na6. Black's only move is 20...Qa5, but even that is looking pretty grim after 21.b4 Nxb4 22.axb4 Qxb4.} Qd6 {? a5 looked like a kind of dangerous place to run, but as I explained above, it was best. Now White picks up two Knights instead of one! Right here, the game comes to the downhill part of the journey, and accelerates quickly toward its end.} 21. Qxa6+ Kd8 {I think 21...Kb8 was maybe a little safer--it's never very safe to have your King and Queen sharing a line (in this case the d-file) if you can help it.} 22. e5 {Following up, White now forks the Queen and Knight, winning another piece.} Qc6 23. exf6 gxf6 24. d5 {! White finds another tactic, made possible by Black's ...Kd8. It looks like Black can simply win the pawn...} exd5 25. Nxd5 {...But in reality, by pushing d4-d5, White has opened the d-file for a Rook, so Black cannot take the Knight: 25...Qxd5?? 26.Rad1 wins the Queen.} f5 {The GK computer thinks this is a blunder, but really Black ought to be credited for sticking with it at all in this position. It would be absolutely understandable for him to resign right here, as he is down two minor pieces with no possible counterplay.} 26. Rad1 Ke8 {Getting off the dangerous d-file (though this actually allows the WQ to penetrate and set up a mating net, there was really nothing Black could have done at this point).} 27. Qc8+ Kf7 28. Qxf5+ Kg7 {Mate is inevitable. White simply has too many pieces.} 29. Qg5+ Kh7 30. Qxh5+ Kg8 {It's mate in 4 now, with a simple, pretty little combination. Try to find it before going on.} 31. Rxf8+ {Drawing the BK out of the "safety" of his Rooks.} Kxf8 32. Rf1+ Kg7 {32...Qf6 holds out one move longer.} 33. Qf7# {Many thanks to kneilca2 for this game! There were definitely good chances for both players to leap ahead with tactical maneuvers, and once that happened, the rest of the game followed swiftly. Comments on the game or the analysis are appreciated. Thanks for reading!}
