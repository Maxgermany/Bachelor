[Opening "Sicilian (B32), Flohr variation"]

1. e4 c5 {During this tournament, two youngsters were drawing a lot of attention; of course the 24-year old Latvian Michail Tal, by then the strongest player of Russia and even daring the great Botvinnik, who - by the way - dethroned Alekhine; Alekhine died without ever having played again for his title. And then there was this 18-year old brat from America, Bobby Fischer, who already succesfully had beaten most of all (European) grandmasters of that time; like the late and great Paul Morphy did before him...} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e6 5. Nc3 {At this time, Fischer had never won a game against Tal; he lost four games with only two draws to account for. So Tal was truly a nemesis to Fischer; this variation was meant to diffuse Tal, because earlier in his career Fischer succesfully used Nb5, d6, Bf4 at Buenos Aires 1960... the Taimanov variation - deployed by Morphy, even before is was invented - which is indeed much stronger...} Qc7 6. g3 {Qc7, as supposed to avoid a direct Bf4; Whites' next simple move however 'masks a cunningly new idea' (Botvinnik); nowadays a normal practice against the Sicilian; g3, Bg2, 0-0, f4... at that time however, this was a novelty; and Tal turns it into a trap...} Nf6 {Tal clearly wasn't paying attention: needed was a6, Bg2, Nf6; Fischer did not hesitate to call this 'probably the losing move' in his annotations...} 7. Ndb5 {not very pleasant...} Qb8 8. Bf4 {truly inspired, and way stronger than Bg5 or even Bg2; the logical reply e5, Bg5, a6, Bxf6 is failing at either axb5, Bg5 or exf6, Na3...} Ne5 {so Tal chose the risky way, just like he was used to; Whites' next move however, comes as a surprise...} 9. Be2 {suddenly White has the better of the game; preparing Qd4, while still guarding b5 and g4... best for Black is d6, Qd4, Nc6, Nxd6+, Bxd6, Qxd6, e5, or a6, Qd4, d6, Rd1, Nfd7 etc...} Bc5 {making matters worse...} 10. Bxe5 Qxe5 11. f4 Qb8 12. e5 {there is no doubt, that Black is in big trouble here; Ng1, Ne4, Be7, Qd2, followed by Nd6+ and 0-0-0 is crushing...} a6 {no choice left...} 13. exf6 axb5 14. fxg7 {too eager to win material; after exf6, axb5, Ne4!, Bf8, Qd4, g6, Bxb5, Whites' advantage is even more substantial...} Rg8 15. Ne4 Be7 16. Qd4 Ra4 {trying to confuse the issue at hand; best is of course Qc7 (again: Botvinnik) or maybe Qa7...} 17. Nf6+ Bxf6 18. Qxf6 Qc7 19. O-O-O {another inspired move to cover for c2; Bh5 is met with d5 and probable (?) drawing chances, and Bxb5 costs a piece after Qa5+... all other moves give Black the chance to regroup...} Rxa2 {there is no direct cure for Bxb5, so Tal plunges into the deep...} 20. Kb1 Ra6 21. Bxb5 {again, Fischer is too intent to win material; he misses out on Bh5!, d6 (d5?, Rxd5!), Rhe1, Qe7, Qh6, Kd7, Qxh7, with a quick win ahead...} Rb6 22. Bd3 e5 {Qd8 is going nowhere fast, after Qh6, f5, Qh5+, Ke7, g4!...} 23. fxe5 {Qxe5+, Qxe5, fxe5, Rxg7, was still giving drawing chances; but Fischer goes straight for the win, saccing his Queen along the way...} Rxf6 24. exf6 Qc5 {the only one: after Qb6, Rhf1, all is over...} 25. Bxh7 Qg5 26. Bxg8 Qxf6 27. Rhf1 Qxg7 28. Bxf7+ {relentless...} Kd8 29. Be6 Qh6 {Kc7, Bf5 holds the pressure...} 30. Bxd7 {stops fussing about...} Bxd7 31. Rf7 Qxh2 32. Rdxd7+ Ke8 33. Rde7+ Kd8 34. Red7+ Kc8 35. Rdc7+ Kd8 36. Rfd7+ Ke8 37. Rd1 {White has been gaining clock time...} b5 38. Rb7 Qh5 {Qxg3, Rxb5 is equally convincing...} 39. g4 Qh3 {Qxg4, Rh1, Qd4, Rh8+, Qxh8, Rb8+ wins...} 40. g5 Qf3 41. Re1+ Kf8 42. Rxb5 Kg7 43. Rb6 Qg3 44. Rd1 Qc7 45. Rdd6 Qc8 {Qc5, Rb7+, Kg8, Rd8 mate...} 46. b3 {directly winning is Ra6, Kg8 Ra7, Qf8, Rc6, Qf1+, Ka2; Fischer uses force by tempo...} Kh7 {eventually, Black will lose the Queen; so Tal capitulates...} 47. Rba6 {closes all escapes for Black, so Tal resigned... despite the fact, that Fischer didn't lose a single game, and won from Tal and all the strongest in the field, Tal won this tournament with Fischer coming in second trailing one point...}
