1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  This has been my last game with the Master Mater or which will be for a while - he sure finished the game in his style!  Anyhow, this game starts off with a Reti (1. Nf3) and Freddy gives me a bizarre looking gambit - (2.g5).} g5 {2. ...... g5 - of which gameknot calls it a Mistake: +1.17 » … g5 1. Nxg5 h6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Rg8 4. Rg1 Nc6 5. d3 d6 6. e4 Be6 7. Be3 Nb4 Best: +0.00 » … Nf6 1. c4 (the more regular line of the Reti).  Freddy was trying to take me out of the DB here.} 2. Nxg5 e5 3. d4 h6 4. Nf3 e4 5. Nfd2 {5. Nfd2 - this knight has been kicked around for the last two or three moves and now blocks in Fou Lenoir.} d5 6. c4 Nf6 7. cxd5 Qxd5 {7. ..... Qxd5 - the Wicked Witch of the West is well centralised here and not very easy to drive away.} 8. e3 Nc6 9. Nc3 {9. Nc3 - but at least here I manage to develop with an attack on that evil besom!} Qf5 10. f3 exf3 11. Nxf3 {11. Nxf3 - I decided to try and get rid of that cramping pawn, improve the position of my king knight and free up a square for Fou Lenoir.  Nice to accomplish 3 things in one move!} Bd7 12. Bd3 Qh5 13. Qe2 O-O-O 14. Bd2 {14. Bd2 - all my pieces are now developed and I have a choice as to where to put Henry.  Kingside or Queenside, which is the safest?  Oh where is my crystal ball when I need it?} Nb4 15. O-O-O {15. 0-0-0 - queenside I choose you!  I did consider the kingside but then Freddy has a ready-made open g column to attack Henry, he already has the Wicked Witch on the h column and all he has to do is to develop his dsb and then the heavies can pile up quite quickly on the g column.  I remember a game where I took what looked like a free pawn on the file in front of Henry where he could bring a rook to quickly - Freddy did use this as a basis for a mating attack so once bitten, twice shy!} Nxd3+ 16. Qxd3 {16. Qxd3 - oh, oh, with Fou Leblanc off the board Freddy now has carte blanche to put his lsb on the b1-h7 diagonal.} Rg8 17. Qf1 Nd5 18. Ne5 {18. Ne5 - this move looked good at the time, piling up on the f7 pawn and threatening to exchange on d2 to get rid of said light square bishop.} Nxc3 19. Bxc3 {19. Bxc3 - but Freddy had a very clever intermezzo - a forced exchange on c3.} Be6 20. a3 Bd6 21. Rd2 {21. Rd2?! - I was doing OK until here when gameknot marked up this move as an Inaccuracy: -1.03 » 21. Rd2 Bxe5 22. dxe5 Rxd2 23. Kxd2 Bd5 24. Rg1 Qxh2 25. Kc1 Rg6 26. Rh1 Qxg2 27. Qxg2 Bxg2 28. Rd1 Best: -0.09 » 21. Qf3 Qg5 22. g3 f6 23. d5 Bxe5 24. dxe6 Bxc3 25. bxc3 Qe5 26. Rd4 Qxe6 27. Rhd1 Rd6 28. Rxd6 cxd6  Hmm, I like the look of the best line - I would have then followed it up with 29. Qd5 forcing an exchange of queens and activating my rook.  Sadly I missed that line.} Bxe5 22. dxe5 Rxd2 23. Kxd2 {23. Kxd2 - this rook trade does not ease the pressure on my position, Freddy still has enough pieces to combine a mating attack.} Qg6 24. g3 Qe4 25. Rg1 Bf5 26. Qc1 {26. Qc1 - oh dear, that move was to prevent Qc2+ but gameknot calls it a Blunder: -7.03 » 26. Qc1 Rd8+ 27. Bd4 Rxd4+ 28. exd4 Qxd4+ 29. Ke2 Bg4+ 30. Ke1 Qxg1+ 31. Kd2 Qxh2+ 32. Kd3 Qxg3+ 33. Qe3 Bf5+ 34. Kd2 Qg2+ 35. Qe2 Qd5+ 36. Ke1 Best: -0.94 » 26. Bd4 Qc2+ 27. Ke1 c5 28. Bc3 Bg4 29. Rg2 Qd1+ 30. Kf2 Qxf1+ 31. Kxf1 Bh3 32. b3 Rd8 33. g4 Bxg2+ 34. Kxg2 Kc7  At the end of the "best" analysis however I will still be the exchange down.} Rd8+ 27. Ke1 Bg4 28. Bd4 {28. Bd4?? - a move which was suggested by gameknot a few moves back is now a horrible blunder: -18.61 » 28. Bd4 Rxd4 29. h3 Rd1+ 30. Qxd1 Qxe3+ 31. Kf1 Bxd1 32. Rg2 Bb3 33. Rc2 Bxc2 34. g4 Qxh3+ 35. Kf2 Qxg4 36. e6 fxe6 37. Ke3 Qe4+ 38. Kf2 Best: -8.93 » 28. h3 Rd1+ 29. Qxd1 Qxe3+ 30. Kf1 Bxd1 31. Rg2 Bb3 32. Rd2 Qf3+ 33. Kg1 Bd5 34. Rxd5 Qxg3+ 35. Kf1 Qf3+ 36. Kg1 Qxd5 37. Kf2 Kd7 38. Ke3  Even in the "best" line I will still be Q for B down and that is against Master Freddy, enough to justify resignation in my book!} Rxd4 29. Qc3 {29. Qc3?? - This move allows #2 but gameknot's best move suggests I am busted anyhow.  This is far more painless! Blunder: -Mate(2) » 29. Qc3 Rd1+ 30. Kf2 Qf3# Best: -18.61 » 29. h3 Rd1+ 30. Qxd1 Qxe3+ 31. Kf1 Bxd1 32. Rg2 Bb3 33. Rc2 Bxc2 34. g4 Qxh3+ 35. Kf2 Qxg4 36. e6 fxe6 37. Ke3 Qe4+ 38. Kf2 } Rd1+ 30. Kf2 Qf3# {30. ..... Qf3# - here I get Freddied again.  Now, I have two goals I wish to achieve.  Goal no.1 - Get to 2000 (Expertdom) and Goal No.2 - Nail The Master Mater.  With every checkmate he has put on me, the more I have wanted to nail him.   My strategy is to watch how you other Knights of Honour guys get on against him and try and glean something from it and hopefully give myself the building blocks and necessary formula to beat him!  Watch this space ...... Joanne}
