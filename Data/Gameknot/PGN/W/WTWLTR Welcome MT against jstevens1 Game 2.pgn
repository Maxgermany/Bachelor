[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. Bd3 e6 4. Nd2 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. f4 {This is the starting position of the mini-tournament; White has adopted the stonewall setup, characterised by the pawns on c3, d4, e3 and f4. In this opening, White wants to post a knight on e5 and create a lot of pressure on the kingside.} cxd4 {Black immediately takes on d4.} 7. exd4 {In this opening, if Black takes on d4, it is preferable for White to take with his e pawn. Why? There are actually two reasons for this. First, it allows the dark-squared bishop to move out more easily. Second, the c3 pawn is guarding the b4 square, which is an excellent location for Black's knight. However, if Black has a bishop on d6, White has to be careful to not let his f pawn fall into the bishop's clutches! Considering it is not the case, I retake with my e pawn.} Bd6 8. g3 O-O 9. Ngf3 Qc7 10. Ne5 {Both sides develops their pieces.} Bxe5 {? Even though this move removes White's powerful knight, it has some severe drawbacks...} 11. fxe5 {The resulting position advantages Whte.His pieces are aiming at the kingside, whilst Black's piece are stuck on the queenside. As a result, Black will have trouble coordinating the defence of her king.} Ne8 12. O-O {! I take the time to allow my pieces to quickly come into the attack later.} f6 {Black understandably tries to break out of the lock.} 13. Qh5 {Threatening mate via 14.Bxh7+ Kh8 15.Bg6+ Kg8 16.Qh7#} f5 {Black blocks the b1-h7 diagonal, blunting my bishop's scope. On a side note, if I had played 12.Qh5 (instead of 12.0-0), black would have played 12...f5, skipping the f6 square and reaching this position except with an uncastled White King.} 14. Nf3 Qf7 {Black offers an exchage of queen.} 15. Qh4 {Which I refuse. Trading pieces here would help Black more than me.} Qg6 {I'm not sure of what this move accomplishes. It pins her own f pawn as well.} 16. h3 {I prepare a g3-g4 pawn push.} h5 {? Black tries to prevent the g4 pawn push, but by doing so...} 17. Ng5 {! It creates a powerful outpost for my knight on g5. And...} Ne7 18. Be2 {Her h pawn is lost. There is no way to properly protect it.} Nc6 19. Bxh5 {As a bonus, I also hit her queen; which does not have many squares to go!} Qh6 {This is the only safe square for the queen, which is in the line of fire of my dark-squared bishop once my knight moves. Unfortunately, there are no good moves with the knight right now... (20.Nxe6 fails to 20...Qxe6)} 20. g4 {! I add pressure to Black's kingside. However, this pins my bishop to my queen, so I have to be careful.} g6 {? Black tries to take advantage of my pinned bishop, but it cuts the queen's defence of e6, which allows me the following tactical shot.} 21. Nxe6 {! I attack the queen and the rook at the same time. More importantly, I took out Black's backbone of her central pawn formation.} Qh7 22. Nxf8 Kxf8 {The downside of this tactic is that I cannot save my bishop.} 23. gxf5 gxh5 24. f6 {In short, I traded a knight and bishop for two pawn, a rook and a dominating pawn chain from b2 to f6.} Be6 25. Kh2 Kf7 {Both sides try to set free their rooks to control the g file.} 26. Rg1 {However, having less undeveloped pieces, I gain control of the crucial g file. I also prepare to lift my rook to g5, attacking her h pawn. On a side note, Black can't move her e8 knight (and thus freeing her rook) as it prevents a Rg7+ King-Queen fork.} Bf5 {Black prepares the defence of her h pawn via 27...Bg6.} 27. Rg5 Bg6 28. Bd2 Nc7 29. Rag1 Rg8 {Both sides free up their remaining pieces. How to proceed?} 30. c4 {! The break-through begins!} Ne6 {? Understandable, but a mistake. Black absolutely had to reduce my central pawn mass.} 31. cxd5 {! I sacrifice my rook to get 4 central passed pawns.} Nxg5 {Black takes my rook.} 32. Qxg5 {And I retake with my queen, retaining the status quo on the kingside. (My queen wasn't doing much on h4 anyway.)} Nxd4 {Black takes my backwards d pawn, which saddens me. She also threatens Nf3+, a quadruple fork, but she does not have the time in this position.} 33. e6+ {Check!} Nxe6 {Forced. 33...Ke8 would leave the king in a very vulnerable back rank, with two mean pawns looking at him.} 34. dxe6+ {Check! (Again!)} Kxe6 {Forced, for the same reasons as the previous move by Black.} 35. Re1+ {! This forces the win in a nice way.} Be4 {Black blocks my rook and attack my queen at the same time.  Other alternatives: 35...Kf7 36.Re7+ 1-0  --- 35...Kd7 36.Re7+ 1-0 --- 35...Kd6 36.Bc5+ Kc6 37.Qc5+ Kd7 38.Re7+ 1-0} 36. Rxe4+ {! The black queen is overloaded. She can't defend both the bishop and rook!} Qxe4 37. Qxg8+ {The fact that this capture is a check ensures victory for white.} Kxf6 {No matter what Black plays, she can't avoid the exchange of queens. Variation 1: 37...Kf5 38.Qh7  /// Variation 2: 37...Ke5 38.Qe8+ /// Variation 3: 37...Kd7 38.Qg7+! Kc8 (38...Kc6 39.Qg2)(38...Kd8, Ke8, Kd6, Ke6 39.Qe7+) 39.Qf8+ Kc7 (Kd7) 40.Qe7+ /// Variation 4: 37...Kd6 38.Qg3+! Kd7 (38...Kc6, Kd5 39.Qg2)(38...Ke6, Kc5 39.Qe3(+)) 39.Qg7+! transposes into variation 3.} 38. Bg5+ {Variation 5: 37...Kxf6 38.Bg5+} Ke5 {38...Ke5 39.Qh7+} 39. Qe8+ {Skewer! } Kd4 40. Qxe4+ {Fun fact: This is the eight check in a row by white.} Kxe4 {Being up a bishop, white should have no problem winning.} 41. Kg3 Kd3 42. Kh4 Kc2 43. Bf6 {Black resigns. 1-0}
