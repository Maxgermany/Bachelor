1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 {The MT starting position.} 6. Nf3 {Probably the most flexible 6th move, keeping open the e4 lines, but retaining other options.} g6 7. e4 {Choosing one of the main lines, perhaps?} Bg7 8. h3 {[!?] An unusual line, apparently designed at once to keep a Black minor piece - especially the bishop - out of g4.  It is very frequently the case that Black is interested in exchanging his light-square bishop (LSB) for the knight at f3, removing one of the supports for White's e-pawn's progress to e5, but also leaving whatever recaptures on f3 none-too-conveniently placed for White.} a6 {Preparing the thematic ...b5 advance.  You will see this little move in a large percentage of Benoni games...} 9. a4 {...as you will this reply.  Black's Q-side operations are held up for the time being.} Nbd7 {[?!]  Probably Black ought to have been looking at castling about now.  Successive postponements were to prove mildly embarrassing in its results.} 10. Bd3 {With g4 unavailable to Black, this advanced development (instead of Be2) seems well motivated.  It supports e4 against possible Black attack, though such an eventuality looks a long way off at the moment.} Nh5 {[!?] Intending to bring a knight to e5.  But 10....0-0 might well have been an inprovement before committing myself in this way.} 11. Bg5 {[!] Most annoying.  Other than bring the knight back - horrors - there was just one sensible response.} Bf6 {[!?] Of course I had to have seen this coming, but it is no less a nuisance.  This bishop intervention at least puts the question to White: 'Care to exchange DSBs?'  } 12. Bh6 {[!?] I rather expected this, though there was quite a bit to be said for 12.Bxf6 (...Qxf6).} Ne5 {An intermezzo.  The other knight is headed back to g7, but I wanted to get in the object of my play hereabouts...} 13. Be2 {[!?]  Preserving his LSB.  As White, I might have been inclined to leave it on d3 and hope that Black exchanged his knight for it.  My reply suggests I might well have taken the Knight regardless, in which case White might have saved himself a couple of tempi.} Nxf3+ 14. Bxf3 Ng7 {The reversal of positions on Bishop and Knight on the K-side makes an odd impression.} 15. O-O O-O {At last!} 16. Be2 {[?!] Clearly intended to free the f-pawn to advance.  But Black is in a position to stymie that plan...} Bd4 {[!]  One of the features of the Modern Benoni is the control Black has over the e5 and d4 squares.  A bishop established on one of these squares has an influence on both sides of the board.} 17. Rb1 {[?]  Whether this was an integral part of white's plan is hard to fathom.  As it transpires, this move gave Black the chance, if he wanted to take it, to force a draw.  Mind you, the respective ratings here did influence my decisions in this game rather more than they usually do.  But having my eye drawn at once to the h3-square, it was hard to think of anything else...} Bxh3 {[!]  Objectively, probably the best move on  the board.  The position is '='.  But it might have been an idea to look into 17...f5 a bit more closely.} 18. gxh3 Qh4 {'Forking' the bishop on h6 and the castled King position.} 19. Bxg7 {[!] Absolutely correct.  For the moment two pieces behind, Black has a strong incentive  to take the draw.} Qg3+ 20. Kh1 Qxh3+ 21. Kg1 Kxg7 {[!] Embedded in this recapture is Black's decision to eschew the bird-in-the-hand draw, and go all out for attack.  Although objectively White might even have the whisker of an edge here, and there was a distinct chance that all I would have taken is a scenic route to a draw, yet I just felt that this was going to be ... fun.  It has to be said, though: it was touch and go whether I would get much of anything.} 22. Bg4 {[!?] This was the move I was expecting, though White might have done better with 22.Qd3, forcing Black back.} Qg3+ 23. Kh1 Qh4+ 24. Kg2 {[!] Very good!  The draw is now off the table; White is also playing for the win.  By playing the K to g2, the possibility of a White rook sliding over to h1 has to enter Black's thinking.} h5 {[!]  I had really intended ...f5 as the beginning of the infantry assault, but after some thought didn't much like prospects after 24...f5  25.exf5 gxf5.  Who would achieve final control over the g-file?  Apart from that, I also wanted the g-pawn as a lever.  That was not on the cards after 24...f5 etc.  This move at least forced upon White the decision which direction the bishop would retreat.} 25. Bh3 {[!] Best, I think.  Keeps watch over f5, for what it's worth...} f5 {[!] I was going to play 25...g5?? then realised that 26.Bf5 would just about have left Black with nil attack.  That was no use: I had to open lines.  White's King position does look porous, doesn't it?  Yet Black still has to find the way to crack it open and bring in his underemployed rooks.} 26. exf5 {[!] Probably best, again.  Instead 26.Qd3 f4  27.Qf3 g5 looks distinctly unhealthy for White.} g5 {[!] This was the plot!  The f5-square being occupied, White's bishop can not escape that way.} 27. f3 {[!]  To hold back ...g4.} Be5 {[?] Wrong.  Much better was to bring up the reserves: 27...Rae8.  But I was lured by the possibility of the mate on h2... (...Qh4-g3-h2#).  } 28. Ne4 {[?]  This was the move I anticipated, but 28.f4! offers much better chance of saving the game, according to the GK engine, which gives 28.f4 Bxc3  29.bxc3 g4  30.Bxg4 Qxg4ch  31.Qxg4 hxg4  32.Kg3 Kf6  33.Kxg4 Rf7 (High time something was done about the attack on b7!) 34.Rh1 Rg8ch.  Although GK gives White a +0.67 at the end of this line, the thing looks very drawish to me.  Incidentally, 28...g4 seems to lead only to a transposition of movesm after 29.Bxg4; and if White tries 32.Rxb7ch Kf6  33.Rb6 Rfd8  34.Kg3 Kxf5 this rook ending looks drawish as well.} Qf4 {Threatening ...Qh2#.} 29. Rh1 {Instead, 29.Kf2 g4 looked good for Black.  However White did have an interesting alternative - a counter-attack: 29.f6ch  Rxf6!?  30.Rh1 Rg6  31.Be6 g4.  I feel that Black's prospects look pretty good in that line as well.} g4 {Closer, and ever closer, Black batters his way towards the enemy King.  At last it looks as though Black at least will get his piece back!} 30. fxg4 Qxe4+ {A definite gain of ground, and material is level again,  but not quite a breakthough - not yet.  } 31. Qf3 Qc2+ 32. Qf2 Qxa4 {Rather unexpected fruits of the success Black has so far obtained... } 33. gxh5 {[?] Keeping the material level, but by opening up the g-file in this way, White's propects take a sharp turn for the worse.  I was looking at the possibility of 33.b4!? a pawn sac to cut the Black Queen off from the K-side.  But even better would have been 33.g5!  The GK gives 33...Qe5ch 34.Qf3 Qxf3 with fair prospects for White to stay in the game, but I'm fairly certain I would not have exchanged Queens - not yet at any rate.} Kh7 {Here come the rooks - or one of them at any rate.  White can do nothing to challenge possession of the g-file: 35.Kf1 Qe4 or 35.Kf3 Qf4ch.} 34. Rhd1 {[?] The losing mistake - though Black was probably in serious trouble after move 33 anyhow.  I was half expecting one of the rooks to go to e1, and the b2-b4 move looked possible as well.} Rfg8+ 35. Kf1 {The only half-way reasonable move.} Qc4+ 36. Qe2 {Forced.} Rg1+ {[!] The breakthrough at last.  White must lose the major exchange.} 37. Kf2 {Hoping to stay on level terms...} Bg3+ {... but no dice.  White has to play KxR now...} 38. Kxg1 {Instead 38.Kf3 Qf4 was mate; and 38.Ke3 Re8ch was mate in one.} Qxe2 39. Bg2 {Still fighting hard - quite a neat defence in the circumstances.} Bf2+ 40. Kh2 {Well played in hopeless circumstances.  40.Kh1 led to a mate in two.} Qe5+ {[?] A poor choice.  With 40...Rg8 Black would have forced mate in fewer than half a dozen moves.  } 41. Kh3 {[?] Of course 41.Kh1 would merely have prolonged the agony: 41.Kh1 Qg3, whereat, to postpone the mate (42...Qh4ch etc), White has to give up a rook by 42.Rd3, leaving himself a Queen down, and no chance.  } Qg3# {[0-1]  An exciting game, this one, with the result still in doubt as late as move 32.  Well played my opponent - some very clever defence had me working hard just to preserve chances. }
