1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 {Catalan opening.} Bb4+ 4. Bd2 Bxd2+ {This is all book.} 5. Nxd2 {This looks correct.} O-O {He's allowing me to play e4, which is great in blitz.} 6. e4 d6 {To prevent e5.} 7. f4 {!? This is how to play in blitz!} b6 {?! Dubious plan. Black needs to neutralize the pawn center immediately with ...c5} 8. Ngf3 Bb7 9. Bd3 {This looks blocked in, but I'll get in e5 and get queen to c2 with h4 and h5.} Nfd7 {Strange, not sure what black is doing here.} 10. Qc2 {As planned.} Re8 {My opponent is taking his time and is down to about one minute. I still have over 2. I wonder what he's planning in reply to e5...} 11. e5 {e5!} dxe5 {??} 12. Bxh7+ Kf8 13. fxe5 {I was not worried about ...g6 here, I was actually hoping for it. Unfortunately, It doesn't happen.} Nc6 14. g4 {?? ?? As soon as I let this move go, I realize it was a blunder! 14. g4?? Nxd4! 15. Nxd4 Bxh1.} Ne7 {He misses the chance. Now my attack is starting to roll...} 15. g5 Ng8 {? passive} 16. h4 {Attacking.} Bxf3 17. Nxf3 c6 {? What is black doing? His kingside is in trouble.} 18. Rg1 {g6 right away looks good, but there's no rush when your opponent is wasting time!} Ke7 {It's too late.} 19. g6 f6 {He keeps the g file closed, but now I blast open the center.} 20. exf6+ Ndxf6 21. d5 {!?!?! This could backfire in a slow game, but it should work in blitz! In a slow game I would probably play 21. 0-0-0} cxd5 22. cxd5 Qxd5 {Probably should have taken with the knight.} 23. Qc7+ Nd7 {? Queen trade would probably giving black better survival chances.} 24. Rd1 {! Now ...Qxf3?? 25. Qxd7+ Kf6 26. Qf7+!} Qe4+ {Black is down to 13 seconds!} 25. Kf2 Rad8 {Now he's tied up.} 26. Rd4 {! doubling on the d-file with tempo. Unfortunately my opponent timed-out here. If it was over-the board blitz, I would have offered to continue. 1-0}
