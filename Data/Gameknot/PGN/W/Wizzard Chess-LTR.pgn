1. e4 {I wasn't sure how the computer would respond since, as noted, it's different with black (especially on this level.)  But, they decided to play KPO, which I'm used to.} c5 {So, I respond with my favorite defense.} 2. Nf3 {This is, obviously, the open variation.} d6 {So, I continue with the usual.} 3. Bb5+ {But, then, the computer does something that I'm not used to.  I expected 3.d4 with the mainlines (3...cxd4, 4.Nxd4, Nf6 5.Nc3, a6)  However, it's also good practice to get used to something that you haven't seen.  It all blends in with theory.} Bd7 {The only other option was 3...Nd7?! for the obvious reason.  But, that inhibits my develop since I'm left with a cramped position.  The idea being is that now, I'd be forced to lose tempo to get my LSB into play.  And, since I'm not used to this, and we're talking about difficult stuff, "Know your Principles" absolutely applies.  So, I'm not willing to deviate, unless I must.  The only downside is that white will exchange my B for N.  And, like what we saw with TA's Sodium Attack, this is an open position which is going to make my position a little more difficult, thereforth.} 4. Bxd7+ Nxd7 5. O-O {With a slightly better position, white takes advantage by castling.} Ngf6 {The idea is putting pressure on black's center.  So, I had a hard time deciding between this and 5...Ndf6.  But, as noted, "Know your Principles"  With that being said, this move was decided.  The reason is that I'm developing another piece.  With 5...Ndf6 that doesn't happen, and to add fire to the flames, I'd be moving the same piece twice which one should not do, especially against stronger players.} 6. Nc3 {Meanwhile, white wastes no time in developing another piece.} g6 {?! Meanwhile, I fianchetto to get my Bf8 better placed.  The idea being is that I felt my DSB would limited and rather tight on e7 (since that's the only square, which is why I didn't push e7.)  However, this appears to be a slight inaccuracy, as well, because like another game with a similar position, I don't think there was time for this fianchetto.  It always boils down when there's enough time to do that which I have a difficult time knowing.} 7. d4 {Waisting no time, white prepares to complete development by breaking open the center (which you typically see after castling.)  However, I will exchange.} cxd4 8. Qxd4 {But, I was surprised to see the computer capture with the Queen (especially at this level)  One thing you should not do is bring the Queen out early, but what's important is what you see from the runners (especially tactical-abyss).  What it shows is that they can deviate from the guidelines and get away with it, but the walker (lower rated players ought to not deviate which is why it's about knowing their principles.)} e5 {So, I punish white for not following the General Opening Guidelines since the computer has not completed it's development, yet.} 9. Qc4 Nb6 {And, I continue the punishment, whilst, finding a better outpost for my Knight.} 10. Qb5+ {But, computer gets out of it by placing me in check.} Qd7 {And, I don't mind since a mentor told me that one thing you want to do, in an even position, is exchange Queens.  The idea being is that a Queen exchange can change the outcome of a game and that mentor (about 3 years ago) made me do Homework on how and why that happens.  My inference is that it applies here.} 11. Bg5 {But, the computer has other ideas since white is threatening to win a piece.} Bg7 {And, I protect by completing my development.} 12. Rad1 {Knowing that my Queen is pinned, white is threatening to win my d6 pawn.} Nc8 {? Which I had to protect.  The problem is that this undevelops a piece, and the computer is going to win a pawn.  Best was to take immediately with 12...Qxb5, and after 13.Nxb5, I can defend with 13...d5  Of course, I did not realize this mistake, until the costly one, later on.  That's why the thing to learn is knowing the pattern which is, currently, my weakness.  In fact, this is how I wound up losing material against reversion, early on.} 13. Nxe5 Qxb5 {This, however, is where I take back.  But, white's next move proves to be dangerous, which I miss.} 14. Nxb5 dxe5 {?? This is the losing blunder.  For me, it's hard to know, exactly when, "To take is a mistake"  Although I got it right in one of reversion's game, it's often very difficult for me to tell.  The reason being is that Jack Stockel has actually made blunders, before.  But, it's rare.  The only time I knew of taking to be a blunder is with an immeidate checkmate.  However, we've boiled down into the same category as what I saw with the same coach, and dynamic_dv, where after taking, I've lost my Queen.  Well, with a similar motive, white will win my Rook, without compensation.  It's ironic because I thought that white made the mistake by taking my pawn with 13.Nxe5, but it's the other way around.  This whole thing has to do with pattern recognition and something that bhidragon told me, after making the mistake of cutting the c file off by playing ...c4.  In other words, he said, "you absolutely must move beyond assessing individual moves in a vacuum, without considering how they affect the entire position on the board."  The problem is that is that despite my best efforts, it hasn't happened, yet.  And, I made that same mistake here which boils down to pattern recognition which is also why choosing the most difficult level is good practice.  Better was 14...Rb8 (at once)  But, best was 14...0-0, (getting my monarch to safety) and after 15.Nc7, 15...Rb8 is still an option.  } 15. Nc7+ Kf8 16. Nxa8 Nxe4 {?? Normally, against someone this strong, I'd resign.  But, since my intention is to post this in the WTWLTR annotation thread, resignation isn't an option, yet.  The idea being is that we follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules which states that you don't resign until mate can be proven.  Knowing that I'm lost but doing whatever to stay in, I take a pawn.  But, this is the final blunder, as I overlooked the mating net that's bound to come.  I'm not sure what the best move was, but my Knight had to remain on f6.  That way, I would've been able to get out of check.  Despite being behind, there would've been some fight left. } 17. Rd8# {Knowing the weakness compared to what unfolded, I will be playing Wizzard Chess on the most difficult level, much more often.  The reason this resumed is that, lately, there has not been an OTB WTW Chess Game with Jack because of Nemi (who's the newbie that's learning the game.)  And, that's combined with the fact that the place that runs it, as noted last time, is closed due to the holidays.  Not only that, but to make a long story, times are getting busy for a lot of new games here which means that I'm not posting in, "Are All The Walkers Sitting", yet.  That thread is for people who are looking for WTW challenges, but the problem is time management.  On the other hand, this substitutes for that as it helps me with my weaknesses, especially the important stuff which why I'm also learning how to run.  Therefore, although losing some time on the website, it's worth it to improve, even more.  And, anygames, like this, will result in an annotation, as we're seeing now which will also be posted in the WTWLTR Annotations Thread since that fits in with the description.}
