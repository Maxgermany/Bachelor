1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ng5 h6 6. Nxf7 {The games all start here. It didn't really help my playing that I would never ever play an opening like this, it's just too risky.} Kxf7 7. Bc4+ {This is the second most popular move, the most popular is Qxg4. } d5 {I've had bad experiences with just about everything else in this mini tournament, the only thing I haven't tried is this.} 8. Bxd5+ Be6 9. Bxe6+ Kxe6 {My king is lured out into the big wide world.} 10. Qxg4+ {Uh-oh, I knew this was coming. The good news for me is that his LSB is gone, I've had major problems in other games with people using the LSB and the queen to attack my king's knight twice.} Kf7 11. Qxf4+ {His queens wipes away some more pawns} Qf6 12. Qxc7+ {Gobble gobble gobble, his queen greedily eats pawn after pawn.} Qe7 {If I played Be7, he could pin my queen to my king with O-O.} 13. O-O+ {He plays it anyway.} Nf6 14. Qf4 {I start to think that playing Ke8 would have been the better choice.} Bg7 {Adds support} 15. e5 {But this is really painful, there's no way I can stop him from stealing my knight.} h5 {Thinking about getting my rook active.} 16. exf6 Bxf6 {If I captured with my queen he could have moved his queen and pinned mine with his rook.} 17. Nc3 Rg8 {Looking for a way to counterattack.} 18. Nd5 {! adds another attacker} Qc5+ 19. d4 Qxd5 {I take his knight, but he can take my bishop} 20. Qxf6+ {He does} Ke8 21. Bg5 {Threatening mate} Nc6 22. Rae1+ Kd7 23. Re7+ Nxe7 24. Qxe7+ {He sacs the exchange...} Kc6 25. Rf6+ {And brings his last piece into the battle. Just look at this position. He has all of his pieces attacking me, and the only piece I really have defending is my queen.} Kb5 26. c4+ {Pawn sac} Qxc4 {I thought the queen capture was better than the king, but if someone else doesn't think so, please drop a comment.} 27. Qxb7+ Ka5 {He announced mate in three.} 28. Bd2+ {One... he sharpens his axe} Ka4 {Two... My king is shoved to the block...} 29. Ra6+ {Three... He raises his axe....} Qxa6 {Four... I try to dodge} 30. Qxa6# {...And he lops off my king's head. Oh well, at least I lasted thirty moves, unlike last game were I was decimated in 17.}
