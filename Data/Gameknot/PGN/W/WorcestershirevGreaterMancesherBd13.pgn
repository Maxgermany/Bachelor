1. d4 {I start with the usual} f5 {He plays the Dutch} 2. g3 {I play with the recommended} Nf6 {Stil main line} 3. Bg2 {Natural follow-up} g6 {He opts for the Lenningrad variation - or should we be calling it the St Peter's Burg now?} 4. Nc3 {I thought, now that there is no danger of him playing Bf8-b4, why not threaten an early e4} Bg7 {He develops} 5. e4 {So why not advance in the centre?} d6 {He doesn't play what is normally played in this position, which is 5....fxe4. Now here Santos, Carlos P (2379) vs. Dias, Paulo (2267) continued with 6. e5 Nh5 7. f4 with advantage to white, but I didn't like the look of 6. e5 dxe5 7. dxe5 Qxd1ch, so I played something different} 6. Nge2 {And I continued with my development.} O-O {and so does he. I decided it was time to develop my Bc1. But where to put it? Be3, Bf4 and Bg5 can be hit by Ng4, Nh5 or h6 respectively. So why not send it out the other way? aqeel (1770) vs. invincible1 (1790) continued 7. O-O fxe4 8. Nxe4 c6 9. a4 Nbd7 10. Bf4 here. } 7. b3 {So I prepare to play it to b2 or a3} c6 {c6 is a typical move in this variation, although exchanging on e4 is better} 8. O-O {I castle} Qe8 {This is another mistake} 9. e5 {Because this is now very powerful} Nfd7 {A sad treat} 10. f4 {Must re-enforce the centre} d5 {He stabilises the centre, but maybe c5 hitting the centre was better} 11. Ba3 {I pin the e7 pawn} Na6 {Natural development. The question is how do I continue, to make the best of my space advantage. I thought my Ne2 hasn't many moves, lets improve its prospects. Nc1 then d3 and it is much better!} 12. Nc1 Nc7 {One knight manoeuvre deserves another!} 13. Nd3 {So I continue} Ne6 {So does he, hitting d4} 14. Ne2 {Which I protect, and get ready to play c4} g5 {He seeks king side counter-play} 15. c4 {So I continue with my plan} dxc4 {He takes} 16. bxc4 {I take back} Nb6 {He hits c4} 17. Qb3 {I protect} gxf4 {He takes again} 18. gxf4 {I take back} Kh8 {He moves his king out of fire of my Qb3} 19. c5 {This now wins a pawn, but I give up my lovely Bg2 and my king is left a little drafty. Shredder Chess Program prefers d5 "and white has the upper hand"} Nd5 {More or less forced} 20. Bxd5 {Contibuing with my plan} cxd5 {He takes back} 21. Qxd5 {and I take the pawn. Shredder give white only a slight advantage} Rg8 {Shredder now gives this as equal, and Kf2 as the best move, but I was afraid of Qh5-h4ch. I was also dreaming of me moving my queen, playing d5 and Nd4, with a crushing position. I thought afterwards maybe I should have played 22. Ng3 here, but Shredder gives 22... Qb5 (or Qa4) "and Black stands slightly better"} 22. Kh1 {Now I have to be careful of traps on the long white diagonal} Bd7 {For instance if now Qxb7?? Bc6ch wins} 23. Qb3 {so I continue with my queen moves, d5 Nd4 plan. Shredder correctky prefers Qf3 "and the positions is equal"} Nc7 {Now I didn't want him playing Bc6 and Nd5, when he knight and bishop dominate the light squares in the centre. Although I now blunder away a pawn, I don't think there is anything better, and the advantage has passed to black.} 24. d5 {I played this with confidence} Nxd5 {And received a shock! Shredder thinks I should have played 25. Nd4 still, and tried Bc6 26. Nxc6 Qxc6 27. Rf3, but still gives that as +1.33 to black. I thought I had to block the g file so I played } 25. Ng3 {and I offered a draw. He had a very long think, then decided to play on.} Ne3 {Knight in the guts!} 26. Rf2 {Rook moves} Bc6+ {Bishop check} 27. Kg1 {King moves} Bd5 {Attack the queen} 28. Qc3 {Queen moves} Ng4 {Hit the rook again} 29. Rd2 {Dreaming of counter-play on the d file} Qg6 {With potential threats on the g file} 30. Nb4 {I hit the bishop} Be4 {Nice attacking square for the bishop} 31. Nd5 {Knight attacks, but according to Shredder, I miss a trick here. 31. Nxe4 fxe4 32. Rg2 and white has better defensive chances than in the game} Bxd5 {He decides to get rid of it} 32. Rxd5 {I take back} h5 {Advance!} 33. h4 {I decide to stop the advance. Shredder now like Nf6!! "with decisive advantage", but my opponent opts for....} Bh6 {Now with Bc1, according to Shredder, black's advantage is "only" +1.1, but I missed his winning continuation, and thought that if I played Rf1 then Bc1 everything is secure and harmonious, but I missed something! } 34. Rf1 {OK Black to play and win!} Ne3 {Did you find it? I could have resigned here, but played on a bit....} 35. e6+ Kh7 36. Qxe3 Qxg3+ 37. Qxg3 Rxg3+ 38. Kh2 Rxa3 39. Rd7 Rxa2+ 40. Kg3 Rg8+ 41. Kf3 Ra3+ 42. Kf2 Bf8 43. Rxb7 Rc3 44. Rxa7 Rxc5 {and white resigns. Thank you for reading my annotation, please leave a comment or two and don't forget to rate it!}
