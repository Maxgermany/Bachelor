1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {The only time I've seen this before was when my opponent attempted SM.  However, people who've surpassed novice status would not do that.  Despite Knights before Bishops, it's a solid move.  But, given that it's 1.e4, e5 themed tourney (with it's starting position, I must think about what to do.)  } Nf6 {So, I decide to develop since that's generally the best alternative.  2...d5 came into consideration with an idea of calculating what to do after 3.exd5  The problem is that this would lose a pawn.  And, the idea is not blundering so early.} 3. d4 {Opening up a line for his Bc1.} exd4 {Not knowing what to do, I take.  The idea being is that if 4.Qxd4, I'll hit his Queen with 4...Nc6.} 4. Nf3 {Up to my surprise, however, he develops.  So, this had to be a true gambit.  He'll get something better, in return.} Bc5 {Meanwhile, I continue with my development.} 5. e5 {This is why he gambit the pawn.  The idea was hitting my N gaining tempo, as compensation, and in return, he'd take my d4 with his Nf3.} Ne4 {?! The idea behind this move is to prevent my Knight from getting undeveloped on f8.  5...Nh5? also came into consideration, except as usual, a Knight on the rim is dim.  Had I played that, he would've won a piece, after removing his Nf3, as it leaves me with a discovered.  So, this appears to be the best move, but according to reversion, it was not.  In it, he said, ..."your 5ยบ move was an inaccuracy already. Better was 5...d5, counterattacking my bishop instead. You'll see this is a very common idea in the Max-Lange Attack(1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.O-O Bc5). In fact, the positions would be quite similar."} 6. Qe2 {As, now that he's reattacked my Knight, I must think about what to do here.} Ng5 {?? Therefore, I thought I could protect this way and aniticipated his next move, believe it or not.  But, I thought I could answer with 7...Qxg5, until the next move, where I saw his Bc1 to stop that. } 7. Nxg5 { reversion: I think you overlooked the fact that g5 was attacked twice, right? Can't see another reason for this move.  jkarp: I definitely overlooked that. I saw it was attacked before, asked myself what I could do to defend. I thought this was the only move, but it still got attacked.  The he explained about what happened after the 5th move by saying, " And for your 6ยบ move, d5 was better once again, giving the pawn back to get castled, in a sharp tactical line running after 7.exd6 e.p O-O 8.dxc7(8.Qxe4? Re8 pins and wins the queen) Qxc7!? 9.Qxe4 Bb4+ 10.c3 Qxc4 11.Nbd2(11.cxb4? Qxc1+) Qb5, and the bishop is immune due to the pin threat of ...Re8."  } Qe7 {jkarp: They are very similar, when going back to the fifth move. But, after 9.Qxe4, I would not play 9...Bb4+. Instead, I'd pin with 9...Re8, right away. I once had a game like this with Reuben, saw that I could pin and executed it. Similarly, the pin involved the Queen.  reversion: e8 is undefended in that line(Black's Q is on c7), allowing 10.Qxe8+.  jkarp: Yes, I overlooked that which is quite bad. I remember now, don't know when, but sometime ago, I looked at a similar line. But, I missed that the move played was undefended. Consequently, the opponent won a piece. I believe, it was a Rook, and shortly after that, the game went downhill.   } 8. Nxf7 {As I anticipated, reversion takes my weakest pawn.  With that, combined with TA's blitz Q sacs (involving the weakest pawn), I asked myself what could be done, in this position.  The reason behind 8.Qe7 is that he was threatening to fork my Queen and Rh8.  By bringing the Queen to e7, I thought I'd gotten out of trouble and was gaining confidence.  However, the trouble has just begun, as we're about to see.} Rf8 {?? Figuring that I've bailed out, I played this.  It did not appear that he could anything else, until ...} 9. Bg5 {This move.  reversion: Hm, looks like your queen has been trapped...  jkarp: It has, just when I thought I'd gotten out of trouble. } Qxf7 {Knowing that my Queen was busted, I was doing calculation.  If I didn't take, the Queen would be free.  By playing this, I get a piece in return, but as we will see, it's not enough to compensate, anyhow.  } 10. Bxf7+ Rxf7 11. Nd2 {Meanwhile, he continues developing.} Nc6 {And, I have the same idea in mind.} 12. Ne4 {Bringing his Knight to a better outpost, whilst, hitting my Bc5.} Bb4+ {Doing whatever possible to stay in, I place him in check.} 13. c3 {Not to my surprise, however, he blocks with his c pawn.} Bc5 {?? So, I try something different, knowing that my position can't be defended.  But, this, however, makes matter worse.  reversion: No, not there! Your bishop has been attacked already on c5, so there's no sense putting it back on that same square. Probably better is ...dxc3, getting rid of your doubled pawn and leaving me with 2 isolated ones(a2 and c3), then retreating it to e7/f8.  As in our previous game, we should only continue if there's something needful to be learned here. Otherwise, just resign this game and move on.  jkarp: In general, I agree. But, I'm planning to annotate it. I won't change the name but will add WTW. They have rules which state that one continues, until mate can be forced. Otherwise, I would've resigned after the loss of my Queen. It could still work, if I didn't post in that club. But, given that the tourney was from those annotations, it means that I talked the talk which resulted in this game, which they call Walking the Walk (WTW). With that, I intend to post it in the WTW Annotations thread, but resigning now means that they will question it, as this is what happened in one of my games against Jack Stockel.  This might sound shocking, but I also told everyone, in that thread that I'm playing several simultaneous WTW games, with the very last post.  The mini tournaments is what I was implying.  Then, I showed him the link where Fred questioned, as otherwise, I would've resigned, right after he took my Queen.    } 14. Nxc5 Rf5 {So, I played a similar to what we discussed on the 5 and degree marks, by hitting his e5 and Bg5.} 15. Qh5+ {But, that does not bother reversion because of this.} g6 {So, I intercede by attacking the Queen.} 16. Qxh7 {But, it's of no concern to reversion since he takes.} Rxg5 {At this point, it appears that I had compensated for some lost material.  But, he pointed out that I did not.  reversion: Very well. So might play some cheapo moves to end it quicker   Now your Rg5 is lost, but it was hard to suggest a good plan anyway...  jkarp: I agree that there are no good moves left. Once over, I'm sure that we'll get a lot of comments, and it'll be shown to Fred.  } 17. Qh8+ Ke7 18. Qf6+ Ke8 19. Qxg5 Kf7 {Still doing whatever possible, I bring my monarch into action.  The idea being that the K is a powerful weapon, in the endgame.} 20. Qf6+ {But, that does not bother him since I'm in check.} Kg8 {The other option was 20...Ke8, but my idea is bringing the monarch to h8 because Jack Stockel has told me that bringing it into the corner is part of King safety.} 21. h4 {reversion: Regarding what you said about your club, you're alluding to a game against Jack that were a rook ending where you resigned early, but easy19 said it wasn't that easy for Black to win, right?  The difference was that in that game, the material is approx equal, while here my material advantage is evident and you have zero counterplay. That's a basic principle to know when to resign - great material disadvantage with no counterplay at all.  jkarp: That's why. I misinterpreted the difference which often happens to me. Yes, there's a big discrepency between that, and what we have now. And, it's true that he said that it wasn't easy for Jack to win. That's the example he showed.  I'm going to see what happens when I resign and annotate. Hopefully, he won't question it since you do have a forced win. So, I'll keep my fingers crossed.  And, it also turns out that, in this position, reversion has a forced mate, as he told me.  Had I continued, he would've advanced the h pawn another square.  If I take, he uses his Queen and Rh1 for a final attack.  If I don't take, he'll mate by promoting the h pawn.  That's something we reviewed, right after the game. }
