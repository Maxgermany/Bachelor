[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange variation"]

1. e4 {As usual, I start with the King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {And, he decides to respond with the King's Pawn Game.  I am surprised because I often see experts and masters respond with the Sicilian Defense, but there is nothing wrong with this move.  BTW, it is going to become a Ruy Lopez.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Although black respond with 3...Nf6 in the Ruy Lopez, this move is quite standard.  The reason being is that he's attacking my LSB and hoping for an exchange.} 4. Bc4 {Of course, that's not going to happen.  Although Jack Stockel originally told me that the best move is to exchange, either elyhim or inadowman contradicted that and told me that it's generally better to hold off on the exchange.  That 4.Ba4 is the best move.  The only problem I have with that is 4...b6, which means a loss of tempo.  However, Master elyhim told me that gaining tempo is like taking money from your opponent, and putting it into your bank.  In this case, I agree with him because losing tempii means a delay in castling, and I want to castle ASAP.  Unlike my last game against Joann, castling immediately is not going to storm into an attack, this time.} Nf6 {Now, he decides to play what I mentioned on move 3.  That's ok, but I am still going to castle, as I had planned.  } 5. O-O Bc5 {In the meantime, he decides to continue with his development.} 6. Nc3 {But, so do I.} d6 {Ok, I don't know why he made this move, but in our next game, this mentor will instruct me to figure out a reason for my opponents move.  Afterall, your opponent always has a reason for making a move.  Even if it's bad, and trying to figure out the reason is key to making improvements in your games.} 7. b3 {In this position, I am preparing to fianchetto my DSB.  Although I am not going to be successful in doing so, I will succeed in my next game against him.  And, that is when he will tell me that you generally want to avoid fianchettos, unless it's the only way to develop.} Nd4 {At this point, he wants to exchange.  Afterall, he has nothing to lose since the position is even.  In that, I am more then happy to accept it.} 8. Nxd4 Bxd4 9. Re1 {?? In this position, I was worried about losing my F Rook, if I was not careful.  The reason being is that he wanted to trick me with 9...Ng4, in which case, my R would be trapped because f3 is not an option. Instead, it's an illegal move.  So, I decided to protect it with this move.  Of course, this is the losing blunder.  Therefore, I went from flawlessness to losing in one move because of this mistake.  I mean, with f3 being prohibited, he could have won my Q with 9...Bg4, and that would be the very least of my problems.  Instead, he is going to play something else, which actually threatens mate.  However, for the first time, I do not know what the best move was.    } Ng4 {And, it starts with this move.  } 10. Rf1 {Because of my last move, I figured that I corrected my last blunder, with this choice.  Afterall, I originally thought that my Q was no longer in danger, and white had nothing to worry about, but I was wrong.  Now, he is planning a mating sequence, as we will see shortly.} Qh4 {So, I figured that he would play this.} 11. h3 {But, this is the real interesting part.  I was thinking ahead and had thought that this move prevents mate.  Afterall, if I had played any other move, he would simply mate with 11...Qxh2#, but I was not going to allow that.  What I didn't know, however, is that this move would prolong the inevitable.  However, he still has a mating sequence, as I will explain shortly.} Nxf2 {So, he takes my pawn, but that does not bother me.  Either way, I know that he is going to mate me, one way or another.  Therefore, if I am going to lose anyway, why not just play a reckless move.  Afterall, Master elyhim told me that if you know a loss is inevitable, just try any move because you might be able to pull a swindle and get a win, from a lost position.  Of course, that is not going to happen with this mentor.} 12. Qe2 {?? According to my opponent, however, this was one of the worst moves, I could have made. That is why I marked it with two question marks.  Of course, I don't know why he was so critical of it because the game is lost, anyway.} Nxh3+ {But, he quizzed me by asking why 12.Qe2?? was a blunder.  At first, I told him that he would win my Q, after something like 13.Kh1, Nf4.  Then, he said, "Look deeper", and this is when I realized that mate was inevitable.  I later told him that 13.Kh1, or 13.Kh4, are my only options, in this position.  After that, black will mate immediately after 13...Nf4#.  He was shocked that I knew the answer.  But, I resigned on that ground.  Until now, I had no idea that this was a doubled check.  I figured it out, however, because I realize that he used his DSB and N to place me in check.  I originally, only saw a the bishop check.  So, the game would have ended in a mating net.  BTW, this annotation is just a prequel to a different game in which I will eventually annotate.  That will be my next and final mentoring game against this opponent, in which there will be a lot more to learn. }
