1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {My now usual Italian opening (if black responds in the usual way).} Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 {Have to admit I would usually play d3 OTB, as I don't like the hanging e pawn and I'm not familiar with all the continuations at this point.} exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 {Trade off of the DSBs, and protecting the e-pawn. I'm fairly happy with this as attacks/pins on f2 are a lot harder without the DSB for black and white still has the LSB to do the equivalent attacks on f7.} d5 {Forcing the e-pawn off.} 9. exd5 Nxd5 {Not entirely happy with the isolated d pawn, and the games DB suggests this position favours black, but there's still a game to be played.} 10. O-O O-O {Both sides take the kings out of the exposed centre and prepare to bring the K-side rooks into action.} 11. Rc1 {Starting to put pressure down the half open c-file.} Bg4 {Pinning the f3 knight, leaving the d4 pawn unprotected.} 12. h3 Bh5 13. g4 Bg6 {Freeing up the f3 knight, although without the support of the g2 pawn it could become a target if white is not careful. Pushing the g and h pawns seemed ok in light of the absence of the black DSB.} 14. Re1 {Simply staking a claim on the e-file.} Nb6 15. Nf1 {I made this move just to reposition the knight and add a bit of support to d4, althouth it allows black to swap a knight for a bishop on a fairly open board. I don't think there are really any particularly good places to put the bishop though.} Nxc4 16. Rxc4 Ne7 17. Ng3 {Following the exchange the knight finishes its repositioning manoeuvre. This also leaves blacks LSB with no squares to move to, so it's going nowhere for a while.} h6 18. Qb3 {Attacking the unprotected b-pawn. Clearly not the most impressive threat however the main idea was just to try and cause black to weaken her position, remain on the back foot and leave some targets to aim for.} b6 19. Ne5 {The c-pawn and c6 now look like weak points, so white heads over there, whilst threatening to swap the LSB that although fairly immobile has a nice diagonal.} Bh7 20. Qf3 {Putting more pressure on c6, also leaves the f8 rook unable to move due to the double attack on f7.} f6 21. Nc6 {I took a long time over this move but couldn't really see anything better. Ultimately though it allows white to occupy the hole on c6 and hopefully make black a bit uncomfortable.} Nxc6 22. Qxc6 {Following the exchange the c7 pawn now needs extra support.} Rc8 {Black defends the c pawn, although this isn't an ideal square for a rook.} 23. Re3 {Re3 with the idea of putting all the heavy pieces down the c file, then maybe playing Qe6+ or similar and trying to get a rook onto the 7th rank. Have to say that I didn't see an actual way of forcing this plan though, but perhaps with enough pressure black will allow a way in.} Qd6 {Black offers the exchange of queens.} 24. Qxd6 {White obliges, I felt looking at the subsequent bloodbath the situation would favour white, at least allowing a passed d-pawn if not gaining material (although in actuality it achieved both).} cxd6 25. Rxc8 Rxc8 26. Re7 Bg6 27. Rxa7 Rc2 28. Rd7 Rxb2 29. Rxd6 Rxa2 {One of the few moves the computer analysis doesn't like in this game, suggesting that advancing the b-pawn was preferable. The suggested line seems to show that keeping white tied with with watching the b pawn and trying not to lose the a-pawn would make it difficult to make use of the passed d pawn.} 30. Rxb6 {Following the exchanges, white is up by the passed d pawn, although the imbalance of minor pieces maybe favours black.} Rd2 31. Rb4 {White must defend the pawn, the plan now much be to try and bring up the king or knight to support it to allow the pawn to make progress.} Rd3 32. Kg2 Kh7 33. h4 Bf7 34. Nf5 {Not so much supporting the d pawn as planning to move to e3 so that the pawn could advance to d5 at some point. One advantage of having the knight vs bishop is that the pawn is relatively safe as long as it is on a dark square, however white needs to be careful whenever he attempts to push the pawn onto a light square that the bishop can reach.} Bd5+ 35. Kh2 Rd2 36. Ne3 {Black cannot take the f pawn due to the response Kg1, with an attack on both black pieces that cannot both be saved. (Note not Kg3??, as Rf3+ saves both pieces, and loses the knight).} Be4 37. Kg3 {The bishop moves out of the knights reach so the King must defend f2, although it wanted to move towards the centre anyway, so this is no problem.} Rd3 38. Kf4 {The king continues to head towards the centre to support the d-pawn with tempo, as the bishop must move to save itself.} Bc6 39. h5 {Prevents Black's king from getting into the game.} Rd2 40. Kg3 {White has to go back again to defend.} Rd3 41. Rc4 Be4 {I think this may have been a mistake, as it allows white to advance the king with tempo, if the bishop had moved to a8 black could have simply threatened the f pawn if the white king went to f4 again.} 42. Kf4 {Advancing the king with tempo.} Bb7 43. Kf5 Ba8 {Another move the computer analysis didn't like, which suggests Rd2 threatening the f pawn again. The king is quite committed to going forward now so white would not have attempted to hold the f-pawn, but the loss of the f pawn may have made the rest of the game trickier.} 44. Ke6 Rb3 45. d5 {Finally with the king's support the d pawn can advance.} Bxd5+ {Black apparently decides that the pawn is unstoppable without the loss of a piece. That was my assessment as well really, although the analysis suggests Rb6+ is better although the line it give also ultimately involves sacrificing a piece for the pawn.} 46. Nxd5 Rf3 {Finally threatening to take the f pawn to allow some counter-play.} 47. Rc7 {I could see a possible mate here so decided not to bother saving the f pawn, black's king has very little movement available here and should the black rook move from the f-file white can play Nxf6+ with a probable follow up of Rd8# as the g pawn is pinned. Getting the knight to g6 also looks like a plan with a sort of arabian mate in the corner.} Rxf2 48. Ne7 {The knight heads off to g6 to play for the arabian mate, there doesn't look to be much defence for black now, it will take too long to pick off all the white pawns.} Re2+ 49. Kf7 {The white king simply steps out of the check and helps box the black king in.} Re4 50. Ng6 Rxg4 51. Rc8 {And it's all over now, any move other than Rxg6 is met by Rh8#, and Rxg6 is met by hxg6#.
