1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Nf3 {One of the debates that is currently being discussed in benoni circles is whether or not white should delay playing the f-knight Alternative variation: For example ] 6. e4 g6 7. f4 Bg7 (7... Qe7 8. Nf3 Bg4)8. Bb5+ Nbd7 [ we have a hybrid four pawns attack] } g6 7. e4 Bg7 8. Bf4 {If I remember correctly this is what I played against Stahandske in our last game(colors reversed) in the Benoni game. If you want a deeper review of the in-and-outs of the Bf4 variation then may I direct your attention to that game. http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/golden-rules-of-rook-endings?gm=50122. But I am glad he played it as white because it allowed me to demonstrate how I would handle the tricky 8.Bf4.  } O-O {I was intending to play... but forgot about it during the game. Alternative variation: 8... a6 [!?] 9. Qa4+ Bd7 10. Qb3 b5 [!?][ to highlight the main drawback of 8.Bf4 which is that white can not stop black from developing a strong initiative on the queen side. ] } 9. Bd3 {? As a general rule white should never allow black to play ...Bg4 successfully.  Alternative variation: 9. Nd2 [!][ the typical move in the Bf4 lines. The white knight wants to go to c4. ] 9... Ng4 [!?][the main response to Nd2. Black  takes direct aim at cutting off white's plan of planting a knight on c4. ] 10. Be2 Ne5 11. O-O f5 [⩲]  Alternative variation: 9. h3 [?] 9... Re8 10. Nd2 Nxe4 11. Ncxe4 f5 12. Be2 fxe4 13. Nc4 Qf6 } Bg4 10. h3 Bxf3 11. Qxf3 Qe7 {Alternative variation: [I did not see much gain in] 11... Nh5 [!?] 12. Bh2 Qe7 13. O-O Nd7 14. g4 Nhf6 [=] } 12. Qe3 {with the idea of Bg5 } Nbd7 {Alternative variation: [I did not like ...Nh5 due to the fact that white could exchange the DSB's so early in the game. ] 12... Nh5 [?!] 13. Bg5 f6 14. Bh6 Bxh6 15. Qxh6 } 13. O-O a6 14. g4 {I like this move it puts a lot of pressure on black's seriously cramped king side.  Alternative variation: 14. Qg3 Ne5 15. Bxe5 dxe5 16. Qe3 b5 [∞] } b5 15. Qg3 {! pinning black down to the defense of d6.  } Ne8 {the knight sits awkwardly on e8 disrupting the communications on black's back rank.  } 16. Rfe1 {white is trying to push through e4-e5. So black has to get going } b4 {! White threatens in the centre and black punches back on the wing. } 17. Nd1 Ne5 {Blockading the e4 pawn and threatening ...c4 } 18. a3 {Alternative variation: 18. Bxe5 Bxe5 19. f4 Bd4+ 20. Kh1 [⩱] } bxa3 19. Rxa3 Nc7 {defending the a-pawn and improving the knight position } 20. Nc3 Rfb8 {challenging white for control of the b-file } 21. Rb1 Rb4 {! Lifting the rook and controlling massive amount of space in the enemy camp.  } 22. h4 {white goes for broke but he does not have the time and space to do it.  Alternative variation: 22. Bc2 g5 23. Bc1 Ng6 [∓] } Nxd3 {! Nice tactical shot.  } 23. Bxd6 Qd7 24. Bxc7 Nxb2 {Now all of the sudden the black DSB has become a monster and the knight on c3 is a sitting duck! } 25. Bf4 Nc4 26. Raa1 a5 {The white queen and bishop sit haplessly on the other side of the board as the action builds on the queen side. } 27. Kf1 {? surely to goodness white has a more active move! Alternative variation: 27. Re1 [!][hoping for...] 27... Bd4 [?] ([but...] 27... a4 [!] 28. Ra2 a3 29. Nd1 Rb1 [−⁠+])28. e5 Bxc3 29. Qxc3 Qxg4+ 30. Bg3 Qd4 31. Qxd4 cxd4 32. d6 [⩱][draw] } a4 28. Rbe1 Bd4 29. Ra2 Rb3 {Alternative variation: 29... a3 [is the same as line b after. 27. a4! in note on move 27. ] } 30. Rc2 Na3 31. Rcc1 {0-1 possible continuation } Nb5 32. Bd2 a3 33. Rc2 Nxc3 34.
