1. e4 c6 {The caro-kann. I wonder if what I came across today is prophetic...  "Kann That Caro  I feel I'd be a happier man...if I could play the Caro-Kann. But as it seems to me...when I play pawn to 'Qb3' White gets a Knight upon 'K5'...and then, as sure as I'm alive My Rook file's opened and my Queen...exposed to dangers unforeseen By Nimzowitsch and all that lot...who think the Caro rather hot.  Then if I reach the middle game...my play is lifeless, cold and tame. White's game is logical and bright...while nothing I can do is right. I grow so tired of 'Check', 'Check', 'Check'...that I become a nervous wreck And get into a hopeless pin, allowing white an easy win. Tell Nimzowitsch it's all a plant. The opening's really Caro-Can't!"  (Huxley St. John-Brooks)} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 {My instinct is to take back with the knight...} 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Ng3 {Considered capturing but I suspect that's what he planned on when he moved his other Knight to d7, and I want to hold on to my Knight...} e6 7. Bc4 Bd6 8. Bg5 {Going to entice h7-h6 with the hopes of weakening a King side Castle...} h6 {OK, that worked but I hope this isn't the beginning of a Pawn swarm...} 9. Be3 Qc7 {That looks ominous...} 10. a3 c5 11. Qe2 Nb6 12. Bb3 {dxc5 may have been a better decision for me here... and GK's engine suggested  12. Bb5+ Bd7 13. Nf5 Bf8 14. dxc5 Bxc5 15. O-O-O O-O 16. Bxd7 Nbxd7 17. Bxc5 Nxc5 18. Qe5 Qxe5 19. Ne7+ Kh8 20. Nxe5... I like how this would have played out better than what I did...} Nbd5 13. Bxd5 Nxd5 14. Ne4 cxd4 15. Bxd4 Nf4 16. Nxd6+ Qxd6 17. Be5 {Feeling a little confident after this development...} Nxg2+ 18. Kf1 Qc6 {Take back with King or place the Rook at g1...?} 19. Kxg2 {Even now I still feel I might have a chance...Though the result of the following sequence I should have probably attempted to chase the Knight away with the Rook at h1.} f6 20. Bc3 e5 21. Rhg1 {GK recommends that I should have gone a little further to d1 and after my next move (a total blunder) I definitely should have done something different.} Be6 22. Kf1 {Man, when will I learn...?} Bc4 23. Rxg7 {Another Blunder I should have brought the Knight to d2 to protect against the next follow up check by the Queen after I lose mine...} Bxe2+ 24. Kxe2 Qe4+ 25. Kf1 Qxf3 {My moves seem to be helping Black out, and no help from me is needed... Vow to self..."Stop!"} 26. Bb4 Qh1+ 27. Rg1 Qxh2 28. Ke2 O-O-O {All downhill now...} 29. Be7 Rde8 {My thoughts were to draw the Rook from the open file so my Rook at a1 could control it but...} 30. Bc5 {I saw something else because Bd6 would have been so much better with the subsequent Rad1} e4 {These central Pawns want to get promoted so bad!} 31. Be3 f5 32. Bxa7 f4 33. Rgf1 e3 34. Kd3 Red8+ 35. Kc3 e2 36. Rfe1 f3 37. Kb3 Kc7 38. c3 b6 39. a4 Kb7 40. a5 {Losing my Bishop on top of everything...} Kxa7 41. axb6+ Kxb6 42. Kc2 Qxf2 43. b4 {The heaviness of the inevitable has broken my back..} Rd1 44. Raxd1 exd1=Q+ { Hmm that d Pawn looks so different now} 45. Kxd1 Rd8+ 46. Kc1 Qxe1+ 47. Kb2 Rd3 48. Ka2 Rxc3 49. Kb2 {My sloppy play from the mid-game has brought me to this. I need to examine the Caro Kan if I want to feel like "I can"..} Qd2+ 50. Kb1 Rc1# {Thank You Sir!}
