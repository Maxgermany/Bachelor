[Opening "Scotch (C45), Schmidt variation"]

1. e4 {As I prefer open positions, I stick with my usual 1.e4 opening.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch game, one of my favorites (although I don't play it that much nowadays, beginning to prefer 3.Bc4).} exd4 {As explained in a previous annotation, this exchange is almost forced.} 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {The other option is 4...Bc5 (4...Qh4!? is also an interesting alternative, although White can sacrifice a pawn and get very good compensation). 4...Nxd4?! is often a beginner's choice, as they think the queen in the centre is bad, but in this case the queen is actually very well placed and can't be chased away so easily.} 5. Nc3 {Wanting to keep things simple, I transpose into a Scotch four knights. The other option is 5.Nxc6, which leads to a more double-edged fight after 5...bxc6 6.e5 Qe7 7.Qe2 Nd5 8.c4. However, I never play that line.} Bb4 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. Bd3 O-O {7...d5 is usually played first, but I've seen this more than once.} 8. O-O d5 {The usual break in the centre, indicating Black has almost achieved equality. If Black can play ...d5 in a king's pawn game, it's usually a sign that he's doing fine.} 9. exd5 cxd5 10. Bg5 c6 {Defending d5, which was indirectly attacked due to the pin on the f6 knight.} 11. Qf3 Rb8 {Not the usual continuation, but White has only one win in the world database versus 13 losses and 19 draws. More common are 11...Be7, 11...Bd6 and 11...h6.} 12. Ne2 {I saw that the logical 12.Bxf6 Qxf6 13.Qxf6 gxf6 would lead to an endgame in which Black has doubled pawns, but the bishop pair. I thought a master would be very capable of using such advantages in endgames. This move doesn't avoid an endgame however...} Bg4 13. Bxf6 {I'd still like to avoid the endgame with 13.Qg3 or something like that, but all four games in the database exchanged down into the endgame so I thought it would be wise not to deviate from that. Can anyone explain why 13.Qg3 (or even 13.Qxg4 Nxg4 14.Bxd8 Rfxd8) are never played? Now that I've taken on f6, the following exchanges are forced.} Bxf3 14. Bxd8 Bxe2 15. Bxe2 {I have to take as my rook and bishop are hanging.} Rfxd8 {This ending with opposite-coloured bishops and three pawns on both sides for both White and Black, looks very drawish. It seems that Black is a little more active however, but his pawns on the queenside are not connected (though the a pawn is not easy to attack). I would say this position is balanced.} 16. Rad1 {Here 16.rAB1 led to a draw in Jasik (2368)-Grabarczyk (2453) and Kim (2434)-Atalik (2560) also ended in a draw after 16.Bf3. The text move was played twice.} Ba5 {! A subtle move, which forces my next move...} 17. b3 Bc3 {... So he can now play this. The bishop is on a very active spot here and won't get away from this square for a very long time. A game with this move, Preismann (2330)-Razuvaev (2560) ended in a draw, while another game, Pokorna (2429)-Stefanova (2503) was won by Black with 17...Rd6.} 18. Bf3 {Here I deviate from Preismann's move. That game went 18.Rd3 d4 19.Rf3 g6 20.Bc4 Rd7 and ended in a draw in 44 moves. My reasoning was that my move prevents ...d4 for now and pins that pawn to the c6 pawn. I also felt that I needed to deviate first because otherwise battlefleet would follow the game until he had found a better (or more challenging) continuation which would get me into trouble. After this move I received the comment: "You're playing far better than your rating suggests."} Rd6 19. Rd3 {Attacking the bishop, forcing 19...d4 if Black wants to keep his bishop where it is...} d4 {...But now the d6 rook has to keep an eye on the c6 pawn.} 20. Rfd1 {Pinning the pawn, threatening 21.Rxc3!.} Re6 21. g3 g6 22. Kg2 Kg7 {We both improve our kings.} 23. Bg4 {?! This might have been an inaccuracy, as I missed Black's next move.} f5 {Gaining a tempo as the bishop has no useful squares but f3, from which it just came.} 24. Bf3 Rbe8 {Black seems to have a slight edge now, as his pieces are more active than White's, and his pawns more advanced.} 25. h3 {I tried to open some lines on the kingside so my king could get more active.} Kf6 26. g4 f4 {Gaining space and preventing my king from advancing. Again, I had missed this.} 27. h4 {I felt I needed to prevent ...g5.} h6 28. a3 {This was a waiting move, as I don't have much to do in this position. It at least takes away the b4 square from the bishop, but on the other hand makes the queenside pawns a bit more vulnerable.} Rb8 {?! Black tries to exploit that, but interestingly enough the GK computer now thinks he throws away his advantage.} 29. Rh1 {?! This move was to sustain an advance on the kingside. The computer thinks I would have been better off by sacrificing the exchange with 29.Rxd4 Bxd4 30.Rxd4, freeing up my position. It considers that position as equal (-0.09). I hadn't considered that for a second, but it looks like an interesting line.} a5 30. a4 {Stopping a further advance of the a pawn.} Rb7 31. Rdd1 {There seems to be no reasonable move I can make in this position, but this one, re-connecting my rooks. At this time in the game I kept moving my rook up and down, waiting for Black to come up with anything. I felt he did have an advantage, but nothing concrete... yet.} Rc7 32. Rd3 Rce7 33. Rdd1 Re7e8 34. Rd3 Re8e7 35. Rdd1 {"Are you really willing to repeat moves?"} Rc7 {"No way!"} 36. Rd3 Re5 37. Rdd1 c5 {And there it is. I need to be careful now.} 38. Rdc1 {I'm not sure what I thought at the time, but probably I wanted to activate my h1 rook to help defend against the advancing pawns.} Bd2 {This bishop has waited patiently on c3 for 22(!) moves, controlling my entire queenside, but now it finally leaves its place to attack my rook.} 39. Rcb1 Bb4 40. Rhd1 Bc3 41. Rd3 Ke6 42. Rc1 {This is the first time in the game that the computer evaluation gets over -0.8 in favor of Black. It now gives an advantage of -0.94 to Black.} c4 {I had actually missed that this was possible. This seems to be the beginning of my downfall.} 43. Rdd1 d3 44. cxd3 cxb3 {Now we both have a passed pawn, striving for glory on the 8th rank. However, Black's one is much closer than mine. However, something else is going on as well in this position...} 45. Rcb1 b2 46. d4 {"HUH?! What's this?" I thought when I saw this position on the board. Black's rook doesn't have any squares. He's obviously planning some exchange sac, which would get his king involved to try and promote the b pawn. But there doesn't seem to be any immediate tactical compensation for the exchange, so it has to be a purely positional exchange sac. I decided to take the bait and see what Black had for the exchange. (By the way, the computer considers this exchange sac sound.)} Rd5 47. Bxd5+ Kxd5 48. Kf3 {To my pleasure, I saw I could finally get the king activated.} Rf7 {This is inaccurate, according to the computer. It says Black's advantage is now 0.32 points, while after 48...g5 49.hxg5 hxg5 it would be 1.26 points. I think the rook would be better placed on d7 than on f7, because now it doesn't sustain the queenside advance and that's where the action is right now. I'm not quite sure though, so if someone could explain what's going on in this position I'd be very interested.} 49. Ke2 {The computer says this is inaccurate as well and wants to play 49.Rd3 Kc4 50.Rdd1 Rd7 51.d5 Rxd5 52.Rxd5 Kxd5 53.Kxf4.} Kc4 {The computer even says this is a mistake, considering 49...Rb7 50.Kd3 Bxd4 winning for Black. Now it gives Black an advantage of 0.57 points.} 50. d5 Kb3 51. d6 {But now it also evaluates the position as winning for Black, while I didnn't even make an error in the last two moves. I suppose the computer couldn't see far enough to see 49...Kc4 was also winning and so came up with a line that would win a bit faster. I had calculated a line that would lead to a good ending for me at this point, but obviously I missed a move...} Rd7 52. Rd3 Kc2 53. Rbd1 Bb4 {! And this was what I missed. I only considered the immediate 53...b1=Q 54.Rxb1 Kxb1 55.Rxc3, leading to an extra pawn for me. I already expected there was something wrong with my analysis, but I didn't know what.} 54. Kf3 {It's over now, though I'm still an exchange up. The rest is simple.} Rxd6 55. Rd3xd6 Bxd6 56. Rh1 Bb4 {The master is very patient and waits for the best moment to promote. After the immediate 56...b1=Q?! 57.Rxb1 Kxb1, he would have some technical difficulties due to the reduced number of pawns.} 57. Kxf4 Bd2+ 58. Ke4 Bc1 {But now it's all over and I resign, but I'm not unhappy at all with this game. I think I made a very good fight out of it, and even came close to a draw. In the end the exchange sac, which complicated the position, made the difference. Congratulations for a wonderful game by my opponent, who was the deserved winner. Please leave some comments. Thank you for reading, hope you enjoyed it.}
