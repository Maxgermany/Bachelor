1. e4 {Therefore, easy19, is going to attempt the SM, at this point.  Therefore, we agree on the following moves, 1.e4, e5 2.Bc4, Nc6 3.Qf3.} e5 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. Qf3 Nf6 {So, I am not going to allow him to do the f7 tactic, mate on f7.  Therefore, I decide to bring my other Knight out, while his Queen is out, early.  Afterall, I told him that this time, I am not going to weaken my position, or undue his handicap.  Where did I get this idea?  It was based on two of my previous games, with this same opponent, "-Handicap 3-Your Move", and, "This Time for Real", as jstevens1 had annotated.  Instead, I am just going to continue developing my pieces, or, "deploy", as IM shamash calls it.  However, M Fred, responded by saying, "This is not as much a handicap as the game before, but it might look like it.  thing is that you you know that it is wrong whiteout thinking, the players in the annotated game are not so far yet.  But this time i play it and i know what to do to and how to cope with putting opening principals aside and you ar enot so far yet.  Bad English perhaps but i hope you understand what i try to say."  He also stated, ..." i deviate from the principals but i would not deviate if you where as strong as me or stronger. but i also notice that much stronger players then me do the same thing to me as i do with you. they deviate from principals now and then and beat me. Just because there understanding of the game is much better then mine. so i see a lot in a blink of a eye but they see more. You can remember 10 out of 100 things whiteout to much thought. I do 50 out of 100 but they cna do 80 or 90 out of 100      } 4. Ne2 {In this position, I understand that he intends to castle.  However, as we will see, he is not going to castle immediately, so I do not know why he deployed his Knight, this early.  In addition, I believe that this move is a mistake as it is going to block his LSB, later on, so that he will have to waste time.} Bc5 {In the meantime, I do not waste any time, to develop my DSB.  As noted earlier, I am only interested in getting my pieces out, ASAP.} 5. Nbc3 {So is he, but as noted earlier, I would have played 5.0-0, if I were white.  Of course, that does not matter because he will do this, on his next move.} O-O {In the meantime, I decide to castle, but as noted earlier, he will do this on his next move.} 6. O-O Nd4 {At this point, white is better developed then black.  However, he left his Queen out, in a vulnerable position, so I decide to take advantage by attacking it.  Of course, he will not allow this attack to continue, and white is not going to retreat his Queen.  Instead, he and I are going to exchange Knights, which I am well aware of.  In fact, that is the point of this move, and that is why I made this decision.  This exchange is going to benefit my position, as it will eventually allow me to complete development, with my DSB.} 7. Nxd4 Bxd4 8. d3 {So, he is prepared to deploy his DSB, as I am getting ready to develop my LSB.} b6 9. Bg5 {So, his development is now complete.  } Bb7 {But, so is mine, but by fiachettoing my LSB.  Afterall, you generally want to accomplish a long diagonal, when you deploy the bishop.} 10. a4 {Of course, I do not know why he made this move.  However, I recently learned from Expert myevilluck, a Walking the Walk mentor that it is usually a bad sign, if you don't why a move was made by your opponent.  Afterall, your opponent always has a reason for making a move, even if it is bad.  If you always knew why your opponent chose a specific candidate, you would never lose a chess game.} Qe7 {This is now the time to bring the Queen out.  Afterall, it connects the Rooks, and it is always extremely difficult for me to tell, when it is too early for the Queen to come out.  However, I thought that if Fred was able to bring her out, on move 3, it was not premature.  } 11. Ne2 {In the meantime, he pulls his Knight back.  Why?  To exchange my DSB for his Knight.  Of course, I am not going to allow that, so this move gives away a free pawn, or does it?  That's the question.  Note: After this move, he asked, " Are you Ready?"  I told him that I was more then ready, and his reponse was, "ok wel pay attention."  } Bxb2 {In fact, that is why I decide to take this pawn, as I told him.  And his reply was, "i think you have to figure it out afterwards". } 12. Ng3 {Note: My last completed game was against myevilluck, so I was at the stage where I could not figure out the logic behind my opponents move.  Having said that I have no idea why he moved his Knight.  Afterall, it was safe at e2.} Bxa1 {?? In the meantime, I take advantage by capturing his a1 Rook.  I figured that he left it hanging, and therefore, inadvertently gave it away.  As it turns out, however, this was not an accident.  It was, instead, black's losing blunder.  After the game, Fred said, ..."in chess i will give really nothing away and if i do you pay the price.", in a PM.} 13. Nh5 {In this position, he is hoping to force an exchange, and that will happen later on.} Qa3 {In the meantime, I am trying to win his a4 pawn because I believe that he left it hanging.  Of course, however, he is not going to allow that.} 14. Nxf6+ {Instead, he forces an exchange, with this move.  In addition, this move is automatically going to win the game, very quickly.  That is because after the exchange, my King will become exposed. } gxf6 15. Bh6 {So, he decides to attack my e8 Rook.  Of course, this was planned, ever since I played 13...Qa3. } Rfe8 {Of course, I am only interested in protecting my Rook, but there is a lot more that I should have been aware of.  What did I miss?  } 16. Qg4+ {This is it.  Like my game against last-archimedean, mate is now unavoidable because of 16...Kh8 (forced), Qg7#.  Therefore, I resign, at this point.  I learned two important lessons from this game.  First, at one point, black-cat-hamelet said, "The only time playing badly would ever be of any use is if you are losing anyway and try a strategy you know can fail in the hope that your opponent falls for the trap."  The only other time that playing badly works is when your rating is much higher, then your opponents rating.  Then, you can try different things and put the basics aside, as I had mentioned earlier.  Second, a wise man once said that, "To take is a mistake", and that applies here.  In other words, I went wrong by deciding to capture the Master Mater's Rook, so 12...Bxa1?? was the decisive mistake.  Those two concepts are the moral of this story.}
