1. e4 {A wild battle.} e5 2. d4 {Central game, my favourite opening for the moment with the white.} d5 3. dxe5 d4 {What do the masters think about this move ? } 4. Nf3 {"Attack black's pawn and protect white's.  That's you mission, my brave knight" "Aye Aye, Sir" The knight answers"} Bc5 5. c3 Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. g4 {I hesitated long before playing this move because it makes short castle almost impossible and the black d pawn makes long castle risky as well but I thought that the double pawn on e would give white a strong center and that I would anyway been on attack which suits me better but if strong counterattack the defense will be doubtless.} Bg6 8. Bd3 {Blocking the d pawn and protecting white's e pawn.} c6 {I don't understand this move.} 9. Bf4 {White has now a strong center although the scouts double pawns are unsupported by their fellows and black's d pawn is still a problem.} Nd7 10. Ng5 {White has to carry on the plan : control as much field as possible} dxc3 {?! I'm not sure it's a good move. + it opens the diagonal for the DSB and the file for the queen - it permits the white knight to leave his castle and go on adventure and white's to get rid of the annoying pawn.} 11. Nxc3 {White's developpement is almost completed.} Qe7 {The black queen 's in campaign} 12. h4 {The squire comes to help his knight. Carrying on setting pressure on the right wing and menacing h5 to attack the bishop in g6.} h5 {The bishop calls for a guard.} 13. Bc4 {The pawn in f7 seemed a good target for white.} Bxf2+ {A good move from black (preventing white to castle which is not so important as this option was no more in white's plans) but also permitting the next move which I oversaw.} 14. Kxf2 {Almost forced move} Qc5+ {The queen charges} 15. Be3 {A king needs an advisor at his side, expecially in times of trouble.} Qxc4 {Danngerous spot for the queen (dangerous for both sides). If black manages to remove the two white knights, his queen could come on e4. On the other hand,  the queen could be under attack of a rook, the b pawn or a knight.} 16. Qd6 {"Anyway, at this stage, there is little point to defend for white. The best chance resides in attack", the queen says leaving her husband alone with his bishop counseller.} O-O-O {?! I'm not sure about that move. The castle is under siege and no more a safe place. On the other hand, the center is not safer.} 17. e6 {It's a dangerous move for white because of black's d rook menacing the queen but I thought that she could move on the opened diagonal. As for the rest. I evaluated (may be wrongly that black couldn't give the mate with rook and queen). Furthermore a queen needs at least one servant.} Ndf6 {The black knight leaves his king to enter in the battle.} 18. Qg3 {Retreat but still menacing the black king and protecting the bishop on e3.} Nh6 {?! menacing white g pawn but setting most of black troops far away from their king.} 19. Bxa7 {Mate menace in one move.} fxe6 {Material equality, Little defense on both sides. Both pawn structures are almost totally destroyed, black controls the open d file, both kings are unprotected and under menace (the two black knights are dangerous for white and his king has found his lady back and stays on the open file). White's pieces are more mobile and White has the initiative.} 20. Qb8+ {Leaving her husband again, after having rest for two moves, the queen goes for an assault at black's castle. In such a situation, the attacking player has the most chances (or at least I suppose so)} Kd7 21. Rhd1+ {To regain the control of the d file and, eventually, menace the black queen by playing Rd4 and to free both rooks in case of a counterattack which could oblige the king to retreat on line one.} Nd5 {"I come to you, my queen and am ready to lay down my life", the black knight says. Pressure is less on the white e pawns but it allows the black h rook to give check on f file, dangerous for white.} 22. Qxb7+ {Forced move} Ke8 {Almost forced move.} 23. Rd4 {Adieu Madame. (I supposed black cannot attack dangerously, even with the h rook, for the white king, who now wanders alone in the wide world could come to g3 behind his guards but I'm not so sure about it)} Nxc3 {The faithfull knight gives his life for his queen.} 24. Rxc4 {I studied the board carefully to see if white could attack dangerously the naked white king ("My kingdom for a horse") and I had the impression that it was impossible to give the mate, or even perpetual check if the white king went on e1. But It often happens to me to oversee moves so I didn't feel relax.} Rf8+ 25. Ke1 {}
