1. e4 {I didn't know how William would open, but I was ready to respond with my favorite defense.} c5 2. Nf3 {Going into the Open Variation.} d6 {Of course, I'm going to stick to what I know.  But, I didn't what to make of this or what this would become.  I also didn't know of the variation but was just taught the lines from Jack which isn't so good due to lack of understanding.  I was hoping that William would go along with it, which he does.  And, it was recently that I learned what it's called, The Nadjorf Sicilian.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3 {I wasn't sure what to expect from William, but I'm not surprised to see the move played.  As it develops.} Qa5 {? Just like my first loss with Joann, my aim was to pin, but I showed my full inexperience, as well here.  My thinking was that there's no way that I'd lose tempo now, if with his next move.  As it's not direct, in this position, so I don't have to run back.  But, as with my game against her which bhidragon pointed out then, white will base his entire attack on getting my Q out before continuing with development for no good reason.  That's starting with his next move.  Nowadays, if given this position, I'd respond with 5...Nf6.  My aim is to get things out and castle.  But, now I realize that castling earlier isn't always good, but proper development is important.} 6. Be2 Qd8 7. O-O {As William, for example, almost has his development complete, whereas, I'm, yet, to start.} e5 {Keeping this in mind and thinking about where I stand, I go on the attack.} 8. Nf5 Bxf5 {Thinking that d6 was attacked twice but defended once, I exchange right away.  What I forgot, however, is that d6 was defended twice because of my Bf8.  I would've been better off playing 8...Nf6 here, as noted earlier.} 9. exf5 Qf6 {?! Rather then continuing with my development, which I should've done, I go right after William's pawn.  Being in that pompous move that I was, my attitude was that white just made a mistake and allowed me to get a pawn, without anything in return.  But, that wasn't the case since my Q is about to be harrassed.  I didn't realize the significance of something like 11.Re1 until recently.  But, this centralizes his R and will bring William even closer to controlling the center, whereas, I barely have anything developed.} 10. Nd5 Qd8 11. Re1 Nf6 {I, finally, start developing.  But, it's a bit late for that.} 12. Be3 {As William completes his development.  Not sure what to do, I exchange.  As my thinking was that it's better to do this then just lose material.  Even if I weren't behind in development, this is definitely the wrong approach, as I saw in my first game with Ken.} Nxd5 13. Qxd5 Qc7 {I thought about continuing with my development which would've now been too little too late because of William's next move.  But, I had the c2 pawn in mind which will make things worse.  So, while material is level, William is certainly winning here, especially with his next move.  But, that's a signature of not having any experience.} 14. Bh5 g6 {Thinking that his last move was pointless, I attack.} 15. Bg4 {But, what didn't occur to me was the pressure and attack that William has on my K side.  It wouldn't have occurred to me, until my rated game with bhidragon.  But, this position is definitely a losing proposition for black.  The reason being is that his pieces are pointed right at my monarch, and that's because of how much sooner white developed them.} Nd7 {Continuing with my development, but it's on the late side now.} 16. Bg5 {But, it's of no use now.} f6 {Not sure what William wanted and still finding the previous move pointless, I went right after his B.} 17. fxg6 {But, William didn't care and for good reason.  I just assumed, however, that this was a blunder and recaptured his Bg5.  However, I'm in for a very rude awakening now because is mate is not far off now.} fxg5 18. Qf7+ {It didn't even occur to me at this point.  } Kd8 19. gxh7 {This is the starting position of where I was thinking about what had occurred with the game this morning.  The idea is that if I take on h7, William will get my Q.  Nowadays, I'd respond with 19...Nc5 in an attempt to exchange Q.  But, that would not work because the passed pawn is dangerous.  And, with that he would answer with 20.Qg8!, and back then, I'd find it a blunder and respond with 20...Rxg8.  But, that, of course, would not hold as someone like William, so of his strength would take back and promote.  However, my thinking was that William just gave up a pawn, so I'll take on c2.  We now, however, get into what the opponent wants, and this was white's intention.  That's due to the mate that will unfold.  And, it's with the same pieces that Fred and later Jack mated me with in my first lost with him.  Fred did this in my first loss against him and Jack did it in early March.  I remember because I annotated the one with Jack, 3 days after being blocked by Mercey.} Qxc2 20. Qxd7# {}
