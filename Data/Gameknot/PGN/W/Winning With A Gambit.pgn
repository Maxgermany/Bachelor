1. d4 g6 2. c4 Bg7 3. Nc3 c5 4. Nf3 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nc6 6. Nxc6 {If I'm not mistaken, I think this capture is generally frowned upon as it strengthens Black's pawn center.} bxc6 7. g3 Nf6 8. Bg2 O-O 9. O-O d6 {Giving up a pawn for development and pressure on the b-file.  I think the principle is similar to the Benko.  } 10. Bxc6 Rb8 11. Bg2 Qa5 12. a3 Be6 13. Nd5 Nxd5 14. cxd5 Bd7 15. Rb1 Ba4 16. b3 Qb5 {Winning back the gambit pawn.} 17. e4 Bxb3 18. Qf3 Qa4 19. Bb2 {A natural try, but loses material.  Black's bishops sweep the board, while White's Bg2 isn't quite keeping up.} Bc4 20. Bxg7 Bxf1 21. Rxb8 Rxb8 22. Bh6 Bxg2 23. Kxg2 {White comes out of that down the exchange, but Black has to ensure that White can't get anything going on the dark squares around Black's king.} Qb3 24. Qg4 Qc4 25. Qh4 f5 26. Bf4 {Of course, Black would be happy to see 26 Qxe7 Qxe4  and simplification to a won ending.} Qxe4+ 27. Kh3 Qe2 {With too many threats for White to meet.  The list includes 28.. Qg4 , again simplifying to a won ending, 28 Qxf2 and the threat that White missed completely.} 28. Be3 Qf1# {}
