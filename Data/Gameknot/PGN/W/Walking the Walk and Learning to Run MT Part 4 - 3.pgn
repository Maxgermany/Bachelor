[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {I don't really know much about book openings, but the database says this is Philidor's defence.} 3. d4 {This is the most common move at this point, and I prefer it as I like open games rather than ones where the board is clogged up with static pawns.} Bg4 4. Bc4 {Putting a bit of pressure on f7, this might be useful later on. Recently I've taken to putting the LSB on c4 rather than b5 to see how it works out.} Nf6 5. dxe5 {Making some space in the centre, if ..dxe5 then Qxd8 and black can't castle.} Bxf3 6. Qxf3 {Retaking with the queen to keep the K-side pawns in tact.} dxe5 {With the white queen no longer on d1, black can do this without losing his right to castle.} 7. Qb3 {putting a double attack on f7, which is only defended once, this forces black to try to defend it. The white queen is also attacking b7, so black cannot defend both threats at once.} Qe7 {Protecting f7.} 8. Qxb7 {Taking the undefended pawn, and putting black at risk of losing his rook.} Qc5 {Attacks the undefended LSB, also points at f2.} 9. Qb5+ {I had a good think about this move, I suspected I could probably get away with taking the rook, but I was a bit concerned about my king being out in the open and black playing Ng4, so decided to swap queens and take the one pawn advantage.  Analysis with houdini says this is a blunder, scoring Qxa8 as +7 and Qb5+ as +1. } Qxb5 10. Bxb5+ c6 11. Bd3 {Having swapped queens, the LSB moves back to defend e4 from the knight.} Nbd7 12. Be3 {12 moves in so really need to get the pieces out at this point. Putting the DSB here temporarily ties blacks a8 rook to defending a7.} c5 13. Nc3 {Just getting the pieces out still, no real plan at this stage.} Ng4 14. Bg5 {Given the open board, I don't really want to exchange a bishop for a knight, so I move the bishop away.} h6 15. Bh4 {Keeping the bishop on the d8-h4 diagonal to attack squares near the black king.} g5 16. Bg3 {Only move at this point. Leaves black's king without much defence although with the queens off the board this probably doesn't matter too much.} Bg7 {I'm not sure this was a good move, the long diagonal is blocked so the DSB would have been better developing in the other direction.} 17. O-O-O {I castle queenside to get the rooks into action quicker, since with no queens on the board I'm not too concerned with the kings safety on the queenside.} Nb6 18. Bb5+ {Taking away the kings ability to castle, since black can't block the check with Nd7 as that square is attacked twice.} Ke7 19. Nd5+ {Expected ..Nxd5 in response to this, with Rxd5 to follow, putting the rook into the middle of the board.} Kd6 {This is a blunder, costing black a rook from the inevitable discovered check which leaves the white Knight attacking a8 with no defence.} 20. Nxb6+ Kc7 21. Nxa8+ Rxa8 22. Rd7+ {f7 and g7 are undefended so I decided this may gain some more material soon.} Kb6 23. Bc4 Bf8 24. Bxf7 {Winning the f7 pawn.} c4 {As far as I can see this is mistake, as the pawn just gets taken.} 25. Bxc4 Bc5 {Black threatens to win the f2 pawn, but will need to exchange a minor piece to do so, and I'm happy to allow this since I'm already 8 points up, and it will leave black with just 2 pieces and a handful of mostly disconnected pawns.} 26. Rhd1 {Doubling up the rooks.} Bxf2 27. Bxf2+ Nxf2 {Allowing black to win a pawn at the expense of an exchange reducing material left on the board.} 28. Rd7d8 {Forcing black to exchange rooks. Black's rook has nowhere to go - so black must either play ..Rxd8 with Rxd8 in response, or ..Nxd1 with Rxa8 in response.} Nxd1 29. Rxa8 Ne3 30. Bd3 {With just a knight left on the board against a rook, bishop and larger number of pawns, black's loss is inevitable although he can win another pawn on g2.} Nxg2 31. Rh8 {Picking off blacks h-pawn, which cannot be defended.} Nf4 {Threatening the bishop, although of course exchanging won't help black's cause.} 32. Rxh6+ Kc5 33. Ra6 {Targeting the a-pawn next, which also cannot be defended.} Kd4 {Threatening ..Nxd3, cxd3 ..Kxd3 winning a pawn, although still with a hopeless position for black.} 34. Kd2 {Prevents black winning a pawn, and black decides to throw the towel in at this point.}
