1. e4 c6 {The solid Caro-Kann Defense} 2. f4 {? weak} d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 {White now has a hole on e4.} Bf5 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Bd3 Qd7 7. O-O Nc6 8. Ne5 Qc8 9. c3 g6 10. Nxc6 {This exchange is advantageous for Black. White's e5 knight was better than Black's c6 knight.} bxc6 11. Qc2 e6 {If White exchanges bishops now, Black gets an open g-file for attack.} 12. Nd2 Bd6 13. Nf3 {White moves his other knight to e5.} Ne4 {Unfortunately for white, the knight won't be able to remain on e5.} 14. Ne5 f6 15. Nf3 h6 {Black does not fear Nh4. Simply Rg8 gives Black a strong attack if White decides to exchange knight for bishop.} 16. Be3 g5 {All of Black's minor pieces are "bad."} 17. fxg5 hxg5 18. Bxe4 dxe4 {White exchanges but blundered in the process.} 19. Nxg5 {White gets no compensation for this sacrifice.} fxg5 20. Bxg5 Bxh2+ {Now White's king is busted.} 21. Kf2 Qc7 22. Ke2 Qg3 23. Bf4 {A blunder. The position was untenable for White anyways.} Qxg2+ 24. Rf2 Qg4+ 25. Ke3 Rh3+ {White is losing huge material here.} 26. Kd2 Bxf4+ 27. Rxf4 {White sacs the exchange to avoid losing his queen. Here, White resigned. Note how Black's king has always been on e8.}
