1. d4 {Lesson learned not to repeat moves and found that this admits I made the wrong moves too many time in my game with elyhim. I opened d4 and made it 45 Plus moves when the mating net was dropped on this sly fox. I resigned before the mate but I don't give up easy or do I? I used the analyze the board through out the game and this Redfox was out smarted and instead of rising, I raised the white flag! Good game elyhim. As part of my conditional surrender I am hear now to annotate our game.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 {c4 e6 3.Nc3 d5  4.cxd5 exd5  5.Bg5 c6  } 4. cxd5 exd5 {This was played so far with ease.} 5.
