1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {I like that opening, and he responded good.} Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. Ng5 {Attacking f7. He obviously is a good player } Ng4 {Copy-catting in this position is OK. Especially how he plays it. } 7. Nxf7 {I thought I had him, but I overlooked Qh4} Qh4 {See.} 8. h3 Bxf2+ 9. Rxf2 {Why I did that? Here are the variations: 9. kh1, qg3 10. rxf2, Nxf2+. The rook move kinda has to sow up or else 10. ...Qh2# comes into play.} Qxf2+ 10. Kh1 Qh4 {A wise move. Same thing as my variation last move. Threatens Nf2+} 11. Bg5 {Bg5 looks like a pretty promising counter- attack. Of course I hate the pin on the H- file.} Nf2+ 12. Kh2 Ng4+ 13. Kh1 {Was he going to do it or not?} Qf2 {He Made a mistake here.  Qg3 is best. I was thinking of Rf8, but Bxh4. I would be really bad if I overlooked that. } 14. Nxh8 {Take THAT. He could not control both situations. } h6 {Things were looking good for me now, even though black's queen was in an uncomfortable position.} 15. hxg4 hxg5 16. Nf7 Bxg4 17. Qxg4 Nd4 {My rook had only one chance to escape.} 18. Nc3 Qh4+ {Why would black want to throw away its queen when it is so much behind?!} 19. Qxh4 gxh4 20. Ng5 O-O-O {Dream on Arham, that pawn won't promote. } 21. Be6+ {Figure this math out: Lets say black was a rook down. With is better for white, 5 points to 0, or 40 points to 35? If I were white, I'd want the 5 to 0. There is no reason why white falls behind in the trade, that is why black did not want it.} Kb8 22. Bb3 {Protecting the pawn, and tempting black with another trade.} Rh8 23. Ne6 {again} Nf3 {23. ...Nf3?? Why? Arham, you are not going to promote! Don't give up your pieces unless you know you can succeed in promoting!} 24. gxf3 h3 25. Ng5 h2 {I forced him down towards my king AND rook.} 26. Rf1 {Going after the pawn, and taking my time. You see how the whole 5 to 0 or 30 to 25 thing is working out for me?} d5 {He starts giving up on purpose.} 27. Bxd5 c6 28. Be6 Kc7 29. Rf2 Rh5 30. Nf7 {Finally, safe!} Rh3 31. Bxh3 {I think he just didn't see that. I'm not sure, because, there was the fact of 31. Rxh2, Rxf3, but he did play 26. ...d5, so I dont know.} g5 {Now he TOTALLY is just giving up.} 32. Nxe5 g4 33. fxg4 {Now my pawn will go over and promote. Easy as that.} Kd6 34. Nc4+ Kc5 35. Rxh2 b5 36. Nd2 b4 37. Ne2 a5 38. Nb3+ Kb5 39. Ned4+ Ka4 {He obviously was trying to stalemate himself, but I had a plan up my sleeve. Do you see it?} 40. Nb5 Kxb5 {NOOO!! The answer was 40. ...cxb5 41. Nc5#} 41. c4+ {I wanted him to e.p.} Ka6 42. e5 c5 43. e6 a4 44. Nxc5+ Ka5 45. e7 a3 46. e8=Q {Let him do what he wants, I will win.} axb2 {And the final move, to end the second to last game in the room, Qb5#} 47. Qb5# {Arham was a hard competitor, but he still has much to learn. I had went to the wardcliff tournament 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.  2006: 2nd. 2007: 4th. 2008: 2nd. 2009: 2nd. 2010: 1ST!!! Thank you for watching. }
