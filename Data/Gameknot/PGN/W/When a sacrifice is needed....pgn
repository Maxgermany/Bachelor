1. e4 {While this is meant to be an instructive game, I have to say I made some mistakes that a player around my rating would have capitalized on. I managed to clean it up in the end, and have to say my opponent gave a valiant effort.} c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. Bb5+ {The closed Sicilian. Not all that popular, but I like using it from time to time. First used it by accident in an over the board event. (Did Bb5 instead of Bc4). } Nd7 {Alternative: Bd7. Either way is ok, but at least you don't trap the bishop in using that approach.} 4. Nf3 Ngf6 5. O-O a6 6. Be2 {Alternative: Bxd7+ Qxd7 d4 cxd4 Qxd4 e5. I didn't want to trade off my bishop just yet though.} b5 {? - e5 allows black to develop the bishop and castle. The longer this is delayed, the harder it will be for black to develop. } 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 {I really should have taken with the queen here... } Bb7 {Protects the rook and attacks e4! a 2 to 1 advantage will win the pawn unless...} 9. Bf3 {...I respond and protect it.} g6 10. a4 {? - played without thinking about a b4! response} e5 {Finally! Was looking for this move for awhile.} 11. Nb3 Bg7 {Alternative: 11. ...b4! 12. Na2 a5 13. c3 Nc5 14. cxb4 axb4 15. Nxb4 Nxa4 But black plans to castle.} 12. axb5 axb5 13. Rxa8 Qxa8 14. Nxb5 {Simplifying the position and winning a pawn. Got to ask who really is benefitting from these exchanges though.} O-O {! - A necessary move. Any other response loses the queen} 15. Nxd6 Rd8 {? - Ba6 saves the bishop as I plan to trade off an get rid of the attacker. My knight has done its job well.} 16. Nxb7 Qxb7 17. Bg5 {Qd3 is also playable but with a simplified board, I felt the need to apply pressure where I could.} Qb6 18. Be3 {I forgot why I played this move. Qd3 was considered here as well.} Qc7 19. Qd2 Rc8 20. Rd1 Rd8 {? - Allows for Qa5! making black think about trading queens.} 21. Nc5 {Instead I choose to attack the knight and try and push for an endgame.} h6 22. b4 {Alternative: Qd6! putting pressure on a weakened kingside due to so many key weapons being gone from the board} Bf8 23. c3 {Qd3 serves well here as well.} Be7 24. Nd3 g5 25. h3 Kg7 {? - Wasn't sure where black was going with the king, but I felt that I needed to get it back to the exposed queenside in order to pursue victory.} 26. Bxg5 {?? - weakens my position quite a bit, but I do expose more of the kingside. But now I'd like to ask, how many of the higher rated players would make this sacrifice?} hxg5 27. Qxg5+ Kf8 28. Rc1 {Keep the queen there for now and defend my weak pawns using my rook.} Qd6 29. Qe3 {Be2 or Rd1 also protect the knight.} Nb6 {? - This move gave me an idea on how to expose the king.} 30. Qh6+ Ke8 31. Qh8+ Kd7 32. Nc5+ {Keeping pressure on it. Trying not to let it sit and get comfortable.} Kc6 {? - Kc7!} 33. Qg7 Rf8 {Nfd7 would've been a decent idea here.} 34. Rd1 Qc7 35. c4 Nxc4 {?? - With this move, I can deliver the finishing blows to the exposed king and attack the queen, whose power has been greatly diminished in this game.} 36. Rc1 Kb5 37. Be2 Bxc5 {Collateral damage, but his job was finished and he did it well.} 38. Bxc4+ Kxb4 39. Qg3 {I gave up a lot to get the position I wanted. Now an exposed king is closing in on a mating net.} Ka5 40. Qb3 Bxf2+ {A last gasp by black. Only delays the mate.} 41. Kh1 {No need to take. Why give black more time to attack when the game is over?} Qc5 42. Ra1+ Qa3 43. Rxa3# {A great effort on black's part. Despite my mistakes, she hung in until the end and had some clever responses to some of my attacks. }
