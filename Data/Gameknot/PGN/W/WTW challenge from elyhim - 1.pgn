[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 c5 {I'm a Sicilian guy so this will be all good...} 2. Nf3 g6 {Preparing to Fianchetto the Bishop, possibly into the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian...} 3. d4 Bg7 {This move order in the Sicilian Defense (ECO B27): is the "Hyperaccelerated Pterodactyl"   [1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.d4 Bg7]} 4. d5 {I thought this gave me a greater reach into Black territory. In retrospect after the next couple moves I may have fared better to push up the c-Pawn in support of the d-Pawn...} d6 5. c4 {My thinking is that I had made a good choice to resist the capture of the c-Pawn and seem to now have a solid Pawn "front"...} Bg4 {Pinning my Knight...} 6. Be2 {No prob... or so I think} Bxf3 7. Bxf3 Bd4 {Yikes! I do not like the encroachment...} 8. Nd2 {I thought that I would then move my Knight to a better position to attack that pesky Bishop...} Nd7 9. Qa4 {At the time I thought pinning the Knight was a good idea though it probably was hasty getting my Queen out this early. Should have stayed with the plan of repositioning the Knight...} Ngf6 {Making room to Castle?} 10. Rb1 {Thoughts of moving the b-Pawn, attack the c-Pawn and get the DSB into action. All looking good so far...} O-O 11. Qd1 {No sense keeping the Queen there after his Castle. If faced with the same choices I don't think I will move the Queen out there...} a5 {With Blacks well placed DSB an attack on the Queen side seems imminent...} 12. Nb3 {Finally, I get back to the plan, kick that Bishop out of there...} Be5 {OK, that could end up being problematic...} 13. Be3 {Needed to activate the DSB, but now I think I should have considered a more aggressive move at h6 or g5...} a4 {One of the reasons that DSB had to move...} 14. Nc1 {Allowing that Pawn thrust may have been the beginning of the end, although I had no inkling then...} b5 {Yep I don't like  how this is starting to go...} 15. cxb5 Qa5+ {Should have heeded Chess guidelines and Castled early...} 16. Bd2 {I may have salvaged my situation by recalling the Bishops...} Qxb5 17. Be2 {GK's analysis engine regards this as an "inaccuracy" but I think it's because so many of my moves in other analyses are referred to in this way that I think the GK engine may now think it's my user ID... It thought this should have occurred...  17. Qc2 e6  18. dxe6 fxe6  19. Ne2 Bd4  20. Nc3 Qc4  21. Be2 Qb4  22. O-O Bxc3  23. Bxc3 Qxe4  24. Rbc1 } c4 {The a and c Pawns are like the horns of a Bull...} 18. Qc2 {Support a feint by my LSB...} Rfc8 {So much for that idea...} 19. O-O {About time!} Rab8 {Looks ominous, from a Bull to a Freight Train...} 20. a3 {I might have time to set up a distraction or roadblock...} Nc5 {The rallying cry going out..."To the Queen, To the Queen!"} 21. Bxc4 {Yes! To the Queen! GK thought this was a Blunder thought f3 was best...  21. f3 e6  22. dxe6 Nxe6  23. Bc3 Bxc3  24. Qxc3 Qg5  25. Bxc4 Qc5+  26. Rf2 Nd4  27. Ba2 Qxc3  28. bxc3 Rxb1  29. Bxb1 Rxc3} Ncxe4 {I knew when he moved that Rook to c8 this was the plan... so why Is my Queen still there?} 22. Bb4 {A queen trade would have been better for me here... According to GK by  22. Bxb5 Rxc2 and having played it out, it's true that I may have, but I also think the inevitability of it was still evident. } Rxc4 {I felt at a loss to salvage anything out of this. } 23. Qe2 Nxd5 {Setting up a mating net but I couldn't see it.} 24. Nd3 Nxb4 25. Nxb4 {Instead, GK suggested taking the Bishop would have been better. 25. Nxe5 dxe5  26. b3 axb3  27. Rxb3 Rd8  28. axb4 Rd2  29. Qe3 f5  30. Rbb1 Rcc2  31. Rbd1 Rxd1  32. Rxd1 Rxf2  33. Rd8+ Kf7} Rxb4 26. Qc2 Rc4 27. Qd3 {another mistake I should have moved the Queen back to e2} Nxf2 28. Kxf2 {A desperate move, but I thought if I had taken back with the Rook it wold have led to a devastating skewer...with his BSB to d4. GK recommended moving the Queen to f3 } Qc5+ {Now the results of the ill advised capture by the King is that he now has to wander around seeking safe harbor...} 29. Ke2 {GK scored this Mate in 11...} Rb3 30. Rf3 {Well I am helping out (unintentionally) Mate(6)} Rxd3 31. Rxd3 Re4+ 32. Kf3 Rf4+ 33. Ke2 Qc2+ 34. Rd2 Qe4+ 35. Kd1 Rf1# {Thank You Sir!}
