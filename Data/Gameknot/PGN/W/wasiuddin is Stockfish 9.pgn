1. d4 {I was suspicious of the quality of the moves. After 38 moves Stockfish evaluated the position (evaluating for 30 minutes) as -0.08 Stockfish 9 destroyed Houdini 6 in the Season 11 TCEC superfinal with the best chess ever seen, and is rated over 3500. The idea that a 1500 player could be -0.08 after 38 moves in less than 2 hours against SF9 is laughable.} f5 {Dutch Defense} 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bd3 Be7 5. c4 O-O 6. Nc3 b6 {The position is starting to resemble a Queen's Indian} 7. a3 Qe8 {Qh5 is an idea} 8. e4 {opening up the center} fxe4 9. Nxe4 Bb7 10. Nxf6+ Bxf6 11. O-O Nc6 12. Be4 {aiming to trade light-squared bishops} Na5 13. Bxb7 {the light-squared bishop is Black's key piece in the Queen's Indian.} Nxb7 14. Bg5 Bxg5 15. Nxg5 Qe7 16. Nf3 Rf5 17. Rc1 Raf8 18. Re1 Nd6 19. c5 Nf7 20. Rc2 Qf6 21. b4 c6 {now that the light-squared bishop is gone, it is OK to put the pawns in the dreaded V-shape} 22. Qe2 bxc5 23. dxc5 Ng5 24. Nxg5 Qxg5 {major piece endgame, pawn structure does not matter much,} 25. Qd2 Qxd2 26. Rxd2 Rd5 27. Rxd5 exd5 28. Kf1 a5 29. Rb1 Rb8 30. Ke2 Kf7 31. Kd3 d6 32. Kd4 Rb5 33. cxd6 Ke6 34. Kc3 Kxd6 35. Rb2 c5 36. bxc5+ Kxc5 37. Rc2 Rb1 38. Kd3+ {The Game is Drawn by Agreement. Pretty amazing play for such low-level.}
