[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {It's the first time that I've opened with the QPO against the computer.  In the past, it was always 1.e4, as you typically see with me, but I wanted to try something different.  What I really have in mind is the Colle's System, since I did well against Bert, in our WTW game.  However, I'm not sure how the computer will respond.} d5 {Once they play this, however, I go into the Colle System.} 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 Nf6 4. b3 Ne4 5. Bb2 {And, now, it becomes Franketort (I believe it's called) which is what I was taught by GM Susan.} Bd6 6. Bd3 {Unlike the last game, I will waste no time in developing my pieces after the final blunder then.  The idea is, as usual, "Know your Principles."  So, don't deviate, unless you must, especially against this kind of opposition.} O-O {With that being said, the opponent decides to get it's monarch to safety.} 7. O-O {So do I.} Qf6 {Mobilizing the Queen before the rest of the pieces.  Not sure why, but the computer can deviate with the kind of opposition I'm against.  Plus, the other idea is, "Don't Trust your opponent."} 8. Nbd2 {Which is why I play this, as the idea is getting ready for an exchange and strengthening my Knight.} Nxd2 9. Qxd2 {The only reason I decided to recapture with the Queen is because I thought that taking with the Knight would leave my f file weak.} Nc6 {Well, in general, it's not a good idea to block the c file in QPO.  But, with stronger players, you figure out why and what makes them play things different.  What are their plans.  At first, this appeared to be a waste of time, so I quickly thought about it and realized that he might have a threat.  } 10. e4 {Therefore, what concerned me was the possibility of 10...Nb4, followed by 11...c5, as after exchanging pawns, it seemed that black might have a nasty threat.  What I figured would happen, in the long term is that the opponent would figure out how to take my N off of f3, and then bring the Queen to the h file.  That would be proceeded with that pawn exchange and, sooner or later, having h2 become a target which might become difficult to drive off a threat.  Now, the idea was trying to think, at least 10 moves in advance with possible variations, affiliated with them.  So, I played this to prevent that chance.  When that happens, I also keep this exchange in mind and know that what I'm picturing won't become a reality.} dxe4 11. Bxe4 Bd7 {Completing their development, whilst, connecting both Rooks.} 12. d5 {? The idea here is to exchange pawns and pieces with this discovered attack against the Queen.  I analyzed the next few moves, but made one oversight in my analysis, as now, I wind up a pawn down.  I'm not sure what the best move was, but just about, anything was better then this.} Qxb2 13. dxc6 Bxc6 14. Ng5 {I wasn't trying to win anything, as it might appear.  If that were so, it'd be too easy, but the idea is just making it difficult so that the computer really has to think.  What came to mind was 14...g6, after which, I'd kick the Queen.  But, this is the cornerstone of where I stop calculating through the variations which is starting to take it's toll.  So, it begins with them exchanging bishops.  By the looks of it, it's almost even, but we're far from that, as black has won my much stronger bishop for his weaker one.  It reminds of that sodium attack from tactical-abyss, in which he won.   That's because I'm slowly winding up in a lot of trouble.  Better was to retreat my Be4.  However, I think that best was 14.Rfb1, and after retreating the Queen, I'd gain tempo, after 15.Be4, since black would've been under siege.} Bxe4 15. Nxe4 Rad8 {At first, I thought that this was pointless.  But, once black played, I found out, otherwise.  They're preparing a nasty discovered attack on my Queen which will turn out to be devastating.} 16. Rfb1 {?? Overlooking that and still viewing 15.Rad8! as pointless, I played this in an attempt to gain tempo.  This is also where I, completely stopped playing through variations.  In doing so, I overlooked a ton of moves.  In fact, knowing just how much trouble I'm in becomes a reality now, as opposed to, later, starting with their next move.} Bxh2+ 17. Kxh2 {?? As you might expect, I did not look at any possiblities.  I was pretty confident, though, that, "To take is a mistake" due to studying similar positions.  But, in this case, I thought that I did not have a good move left.  In other words, I felt that there was nothing better or anything else to lose.  If for example, I had played 17.Kf1 (which was my second instinct), black would play 17...Rxd2.  So, the inference is that I'd lose my Queen, one way or another.  This kind of thing happens without analyze the board (which is why Wizard Chess is good practice, as that doesn't exist.)  But, had white been more careful and played through a little more, I would've seen 18.Nxd2.  Despite losing the Queen, I'd get a Rook, as compensation.  At which point, resignation would not be an option, yet.  But, by taking, as opposed to, calculating, that Queen is free, as we're about to see.} Qe5+ 18. f4 {This is where I start calculating again, believe it or not.  But, it's a very small amount which is too little too late.  If 18.Kh3, or 18.Kh1, black play 18...Rxd2.  However, I overlooked the Knight, until the move was played.  What first came to mind was 18...Qxe4, and then 19...Rxd2.  However, my Queen could still get out.  But, their next move did not come into calculation, after which, I'm doomed.  I figured that he'd get the Queen for free. } Qh5+ {Which is why I resigned by pressing escape button.  However, I still could've gotten the Rook.  However, this is where I realized that there was nothing else to learn.  Just like with my game against reversion, when there was nothing else to learn, I also threw in the flag.  But, the moral of this story is to calculate through all variations, carefully.  Failing to do so for, even, one or two moves can lead to disaster, as we saw here.}
