[Opening "Centre game (C22), Hall variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 {Not the best move for white. Black will gladly play into the Center Game opening. It allows black to gain a tempo by developing a knight with a threat on white's queen.} 3. Qxd4 Nc6 4. Qc4 Nf6 {Black is now ahead in development. I've stolen white's advantage of being first.} 5. e5 Nxe5 {An odd move. I don't see any reasonable refutation by white, so it looks like a free pawn to me - and a threat on white's queen again. I'm expecting 6. Qe2 which then threatens 7. f4 to kill the pinned knight.} 6. Qe4 Nxe4 {Now I truly wasn't expecting that move. This is where white decided he'd had enough.}
