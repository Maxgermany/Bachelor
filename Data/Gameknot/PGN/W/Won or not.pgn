1. e4 {Hi all, this is recent game I played in Jo's welcome NÂº3 mini-tournament. It is interesting mainly for the final position, I'm not able (since I have no chess engine) to tell if it was won or not, and I would like some advice.} d5 2. exd5 e6 {This was a mistake. The theory about Icelandic gambit says Nf6 first, hoping for white to move the c or d pawn. Now, it is premature.} 3. dxe6 Bxe6 4. d3 {Because of this move, that shields white about all the tactics that arise after d4 or c4 are played. It's not a disaster, but now the gambit is not all that exciting anymore. } Nf6 5. h3 {My opponent doesn't take advantage of the free tempo to develop a piece.} Bd6 {Bc4 is kind of pointless, since no serious threat can be put on f2 in a short time. } 6. Nf3 c5 {I can play this in order to get some control of the center, open the lines for my queen, get out the b8 knight without blocking my c pawn, and since little attack can be performed on the a4-e8 white diagonal by white because of d3. } 7. Be2 {Kingside castling, and a battery against the kingside is served. } O-O 8. O-O Nc6 {Black is ahead in developement, but no concrete attack... still. It will come shortly after.} 9. Nc3 Qd7 {Not Qc7 because of Nb5. But a bishop sac on h3 is worth considering.} 10. Ne4 Be7 {I could have played Bc7, or NxN (recommended by GK engine), but I wanted to "tempt" him to...} 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 {...in order to play this, opening a column for a kingside attack. } 12. Bh6 Rfe8 {This rook is not misplaced here, but I plan to move it quickly to theg column. } 13. Nh2 {White's play is passive, but I can understand the point: to provoke exchanges without disrupting the king's pawn chain. The plan will not work because I have f5. } Kh8 {Or Ne5, fighting for g4. But I don't want to exchange, only have more firepower against the white king. } 14. Bf4 {Kind of good, controlling the black diagonal. If it wouldn't be because of the control white has of f3, I would have gone Bxh3 right now. } Reg8 {Firepower into the fight. It's amazing how white, just because of a couple of weak moves in the opening, seems now completely frozen, with no countergame. } 15. Bg3 {Temporarily avoiding Bxh3, but at the cost of an even more cramped game (the bishop cannot move or Bxh3. I think Kh1 was the indicated move, followed by Rg1. } f5 {Hunting the bishop, with f4 the next move. } 16. Bf4 {I expected f4. The f5 pawn is blocking my own attack, but I can make something of it moving my battery to the white diagonal aiming to g2 in a couple o moves (Nd4, Bd5, Qf6). I only have to find the right order.   } Nd4 {Threatening to exchange white's lsb. } 17. Bh5 {White could have gone Be5+, f6, BxN etc, but this would have allowed me to further advance the f pawn. } Bd5 {Step two. } 18. Nf3 Qc6 {Step 3. As predicted, weapons are aiming the right spot. } 19. Kh2 {GK engine says this is a mistake. But it doesn't explains why. I'd like to think this is because of my next move, but I am not all that sure, either. } Rxg2+ {Was this sac correct? I played it almost without thinking. } 20. Kxg2 Rg8+ 21. Kh1 {And here it comes: is this position winning for black? } Nxf3 {GK engine says this is a blunder, preferring BxN+. It is a thematic line, and I thought white is lost, and so did white, because it resigned. But the GK engine says white is >+2! What do you think? Of course the threat is Ne1+, 22. Kh2, Rg2+, 23. Kh1, Rxf2+, 24. Kh2, RxR+, 25. Kh2, Rh1+, 26. Kg3, Qf6 etc. But does it win? Too lazy to see further... :-)  }
