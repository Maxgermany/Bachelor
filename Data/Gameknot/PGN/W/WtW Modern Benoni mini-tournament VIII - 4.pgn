1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Bb5+ Nbd7 {I've been told that the best move in this situation is supposed to be 7. ... Nd7 but this seems good as well.} 8. Nf3 {White carry on with a common answer, preparing the castle.} a6 {Common move as well} 9. Bd3 {The problem for white is that it enables 9. ...b5} b5 {Black has now a very good pawn structure.} 10. O-O {With black advance on the queenside, white's plan is to attack on the center.} Bg7 {standard move} 11. Bf4 {Attacking e5} Qe7 {I had the impression that this move was inaccurate O-O would have been better but i couldn't find any attacking possibiities straight away. So that...} 12. Re1 {Obvious move to support an attack on the e file.} O-O {Logical} 13. e5 {White has numeric superiority toward e5} dxe5 {Black has little other choice for if 14. e6 fxe6 15. Rxe6 Qd8 (forced move)} 14. Nxe5 {14. Be5 was the other candidate move but the knight in e5 menaces 15. Nc6 and the bishop in c5 could enable 17. d6 } Nxe5 {At this point, the game seems equilibrated. White is even slighly ahead (I think)} 15. Bxe5 {15. Re5 might have been better but white's plan is to advance the passed d pawn.} Bb7 {To menace d5 and, more important, to link both rooks.} 16. d6 {things go like in my plan} Qd7 {preventing further move from the d pawn.} 17. Bxf6 {Mistake. Ne4 or Be4 would have been better. From now on the GK computer gives an advantage to black.} Bxf6 18. Be4 {I miscalculated the consequences of the following trades (black plaid it in the right order which I oversaw)} Bxc3 {I didn't really oversaw this move but I evaluated falsely the complicated trades that will follow.} 19. bxc3 {So that I play 19. bxc3 having now 2 isolated pawns.} Bxe4 20. Rxe4 {No immediate threats, material is equal, white controls the open file, both kings are safe, white is better on the center and has a passed pawn but... but.. but... white pawn structure is far inferior and against a master the game is unwinable. I still plaid for the draw.} Rad8 {And white is unable to save the d pawn.} 21. c4 {To trade an isolated pawn against a protected one.} Qxd6 22. Qc2 Qd3 {Black forces the exchange} 23. Qxd3 {little other choice for white} Rxd3 {Now, white is one pawn late.} 24. Rc1 {White is still fighting for the draw which seemed possible although it had to be a hard task against a far higher rated player.} Rfd8 {Black will force the exchanges to get the highest possible advantage from his pawn more.} 25. g3 {To create an escape square for the king} Rd3d1+ 26. Rxd1 {forced move} Rxd1+ 27. Kg2 Rc1 28. cxb5 {No real choice} axb5 {At this moment I hesitated a lot but I think now that it the game was anyway lost.} 29. a4 {proposing a trade} b4 {trade refused} 30. Re8+ {to permit the rook to come behind the black pawns} Kg7 31. Rb8 {Blocking the black pawns advance} Kf6 {Black wants to occupate the center...} 32. a5 {... and I do not see any way to prevent it.} Ke5 {Still aiming at the center} 33. Kf3 {Trying to prevent the black king's advance} Kd4 {The black king comes and protects his pawns} 34. a6 {last try} Ra1 35. Rb6 {White could have plaid 35. Rd8 but it wouldn't have prevented black to come on c2} Kc3 {White has no solution to prevent black to promote the b pawn except by sacrifying the rook. White submits here. Well done ionadowman and a good lesson for me as for game end strategy. Thanks.}
