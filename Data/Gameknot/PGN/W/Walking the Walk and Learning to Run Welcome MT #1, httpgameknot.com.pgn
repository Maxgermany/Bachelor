1. Nf3 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. c4 c5 4. d5 {mostly likely the best because 4. dxc5 Qa5+ wins back the pawn with a slight tempo for black. } e6 {!? aiming to transpose into a favorable modern Benoni lines because I have already developed my bishop which in traditional move orders black has to give a small tempo to develop it. Also very interesting is 4. ...e5!? because I think it is good against computers, black aims to setup a Bermuda triangle pawn formation that many programs lose their way in. } 5. e4 {The alternative 5. dxe6 is slightly favourable to black because he has a better Center to counteract the weakness on the f-file. } exd5 {5. ...e5!? 6. Nc3 d6 transposes to a king's Indian style of game. } 6. exd5 {6. cxd5 would be main line Modern Benoni. However, the game move even though it has been seen in many chess games has no reference point in the Gameknot database. Which means that my opponent is more than likely thinking on his own. I of course have my own internal database that is still in book. An chess engine may very well give white a slight advantage due to his space advantage in the centre and superior pawn structure but Black's dominating DSB more than compensates. } d6 7. h3 {A good idea to prevent ...Bg4 when black will seek to trade bishop for knight for good prospects to control e5 and the dark squares. } Nf6 {? I normally do not criticize developing moves like this one but here the knight is poorly placed. It limits the scope of the strong DSB. Plus in such positions this knight is more active on e7 than on f6 where it supports f7-f5-f4. Furthermore, it takes away the option of a bishop sac on c3 with good play by black on the queen side. The alternative 7. ...Ne7 or 7. ...Nd7 is better } 8. Bd3 {A good square for the future superstar of white's army. However, the alternative 8. Qe2 Qe7 9. Nc3 Qxe2 10. Bxe2 is better for white because of his superior piece development } Nbd7 {?? It is funny during the game I played this because it looked so natural but it shows that my head is not in the game. } 9. O-O {?? White looks to be on cruise control and perhaps that is why he did not take a second look. } O-O {Now the immediate danger for black on the e-file has past and he will go on to equalize quickly. The lesson here is if you have a kill shot take it. When you are searching for candidate moves always include a offbeat one. Play it out in your mind or over a board and explore less common lines. } 10. Nc3 {So what has been the story up until this point. I would say it has to be black's poorly placed knights. What is even more disheartening is that the knights are only dominating their own team! So I am already in danger of getting overrun so I had to play aggressive. Which is the reason for my next move. } a6 {!? fighting for time and space. This almost forces white into playing 11. a4 which will buy me a small amount of time to play Re8 contesting the e-file. Why not 10. ...Re8 right way you say? Well if I can get away with ...a6 and ...b7-b5 then I am doing well. If I play 10. ...Re8 right away I may not ever have the chance to play it. } 11. a4 Re8 {Black achieves semi-equality based on his greater control of the e-file and neutralized queen side. However, position cramping and the problematic LSB still linger. The control of the e-file becomes the main battle ground for this game. } 12. Bg5 {Pinning the knight to the queen. Which has the upcoming threat of Ne4 with a big plus for white. } Qc7 {Not the ideal square for the queen but it meets the Ne4 threat } 13. Qd2 b6 {The lack of exploitable weaknesses in black's pawn structure gives black the to time to develop as needed. } 14. Rfe1 {Rooks belong on open files! } Bb7 15. Rxe8+ {? with this move black retains control of the e-file. However, after 15. Bf4(attacking d6) it is hard to see how black can avoid playing 15. ...Rxe1 giving up the control of e-file to white. ***Tip*** avoid early rook exchanges as this usually benefits the defender. Also in the middle game direct your pieces toward weak pawns. This has the effect of binding your opponent. } Rxe8 16. Re1 Rxe1+ {Ok I know I just said avoid rook exchanges early in the game, but here there is a exception. The #1 reason why I played it is to deflect the queen to a less ideal square. #2 the exchange buys me some time to reorganize my queen side troops. } 17. Qxe1 Qd8 {The idea is to play 18. ...Bf8 followed by 19. ...Qe7 fighting for control of the critical e-file. } 18. Qe3 {a decent move that does improve the queens view of the board, but if black attacks the DSB where does it go? Plus this move is purely defensive because it does not attack. ***Tip*** the best moves are the ones that attack and defend at the same time. Maybe a alternative is 18.Bf4 pressuring d6. } Bc8 19. Kf1 Qe8 20. Bc2 {I do not recommended that you allow your opponent to create a permanent structural weakness near your king position. Alternative variation: 20. Qf4 Qf8 21. Qd2 Qe8 22. Bf4 Qe7 23. Qe2 [=]  Alternative variation: 20. Qxe8+ Nxe8 21. g4 [=]  } Qxe3 {Ok one move ago I was playing for a draw. Now I am getting a slim sniff of blood in the air. } 21. fxe3 {it is important to retain one's pawn structural integrity for as long as possible.  21. Bxe3 is better.  This is exactly what I was waiting for all game. Namely a target to attack. Now there is a few g3, and e3. Alternative variation: 21. Bxe3 Kf8 22. Nd2 Ke7 23. f3 [=]  } Kf8 {With the heavy artillery off the board your king is your most powerful piece! } 22. Ke2 Ne8 23. Kd3 h6 {Caveman has been pushing me a around the board all game like a school yard bully now it is my turn to return the favor } 24. Bf4 {Alternative variation: 24. Bd8 a5 25. g4 Ba6 26. Bh4 [=]  } f5 {I really get a lot pleasure beating my opponents with pawns. I think they are so underrated! } 25. h4 Ne5+ {I know that my knight is going to captured on e5 but I am banking on that my big net on the king side will land the big one. } 26. Nxe5 dxe5 {Black gains a very menacing pawn structure on the king-side which is counter balanced by white's advanced past d-pawn } 27. Bg3 a5 {Any immediate advance in the centre by black allows white to mobilizes his d-pawn with bishop support } 28. e4 {Block aiding the Center is a good idea. } Nd6 {Remember what I said early about attacking weak points. This is what I meant, I am hitting e4 which puts white on the defensive. } 29. Bd1 {Not a good move. The decision to move a defender away from a point that is being attacked is always bad. Alternative variation: [better is ]  29. b3 Ke7 30. Ke2 f4 31. Be1 [=]  } fxe4+ 30. Nxe4 Nxe4 {?? Omg it is so rare that I miss a kill shot but yep I did. 30. Bf5 wins the knight. Now all my hard work of pushing white back has gone up in smoke. Not to take anything away for Caveman but I think it was 3:30 am here and I was in between my 4th or 5th glass of scotch Alternative variation: 30... Bf5 31. Bf3 g5 32. b3 g4 33. Ke3 gxf3 34. Nxd6 fxg2 35. Kf2 Bh3 36. Kg1 Ke7 37. Ne4  } 31. Kxe4 Bf5+ {With four bishops and a balanced pawn structure the position is dead. } 32. Ke3 h5 {Alternative variation: 32... e4  33. Bd6+ Ke8 34. g4= } 33. b3 {Very smart, and very instructive that when playing king and pawn ending you want to aim for symmetrical pawn structures. } Ke7 {Now ...e4-e5 is a possibility. } 34. Kd2 {all white really has to do to ensure the draw is to keep his king circling in the centre. } Bh6+ {Master move alert!! When all other things are equal do not move pawns but make small improvements to piece position which go along way to take a balanced position into a won one. } 35. Kc3 Kf6 {Black is slowly but surely out positioning white. Yet white does have the ace in the hole with the d5-d6 break. } 36. Be2 {it is important for white to keep his bishops active. } Be3 37. Bf3 Bf4 38. Be1 {Alternative variation: 38. Bxf4 exf4 39. Kd2 Ke5 [ looks like a draw but black has the better chances. ]  } e4 {With the white DSB now off the diagonal I can play e5-e5 without worrying about d5-d6 being supported by a bishop for the time being. } 39. Be2 Bh2 {avoiding the immediate g3 and threatening Bg1. } 40. Bf2 Bf4 41. g3 {guilty of moving pawns instead of pieces!  Alternative variation: 41. Be1 Ke5 42. Bd1 [=]  } Bh6 {White has excellent chances for a draw. My only hope and prayer is to be able to play Ke5 without being harassed by the DSB. But with good play from white that is impossible. Alternative variation: 41... e3?!  42. gxf4 exf2 43. Bf1 Bg4 44. Kd2=/+ } 42. Be1 {Alternative variation: 42. Bg1  42... e3 $4  43. Bd3 Bg4 44. Kc2 [=]  } Ke5 {In endgames like this the first king to grab the centre usually has the upper hand. } 43. Bd2 {Alternative variation: 43. Bf1 Be3 (43... e3  44. Bd3![=] )44. Kc2 Bd4 =/+ } e3 44. Bc1 {Alternative variation: [equally bad is ]  44. Be1 Bg7 45. Kb2 Ke4+ 46. Bc3 Bd4  } Kd6 {Caveman1980 resigns possible continuation. } 45. Kb2 Bg7+ 46. Ka2 Bd4 47. Bf1 Bg4 48. Bd3 e2 49. Bd2 Bf2 50. Bf4+ Kd7 {winning a bishop }
