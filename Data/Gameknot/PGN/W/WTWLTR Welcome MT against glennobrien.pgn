[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. Bd3 e6 4. Nd2 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. f4 {This is the starting position of the mini-tournament; White has adopted the stonewall setup, characterised by the pawns on c3, d4, e3 and f4. In this opening, White wants to post a knight on e5 and create a lot of pressure on the kingside.} Bd6 7. Ngf3 O-O 8. Ne5 {Both sides develops their pieces.} cxd4 9. exd4 {Pawn exchange. I take with the e pawn so that 9...Nb4 is not an option for black.} Bxe5 10. fxe5 {Minor piece exchange. Whilst the knights are generally better than bishops in a closed position, this is actually an inaccuracy from Black. I attack the knight with my pawn...} Nd7 {And Black is forced to retreat the knight behind the pawn structure, on the queenside. White's objective is to attack the kingside, so there is one less defender now!} 11. O-O {I castle to get my rook on the semi-open f file.} Qb6 {Black puts pressure on my b and d pawns. This also pins my d pawn, allowing Black to capture my advanced e pawn with either of his knight on the next turn.} 12. Kh1 {However, I simply step out of the pin. My b pawn is still protected for now.} f6 {Black now threatens to break my central pawn chain. However, I have a nifty trick that allows me to keep the position closed.} 13. Qh5 {! I threaten mate on h7. (14.Bxh7+ Kh8 15.Bg6+ Kg8 16.Qh7#)} f5 {Black blocks the b1-h7 diagonal, blunting my bishop. However, this also means that I have a very strong pawn on e5!} 14. Nf3 {I bring more pieces to the attack.} Ne7 {And black brings more pieces to the defence!} 15. Ng5 {I threaten mate on h7 once again.} h6 {Forced.} 16. Rf3 {!? A gutsy move. I sacrifice my knight so I can get a rook-queen battery on the h file faster.} hxg5 {Black accepts the sacrifice.} 17. Rh3 {Just as planned. I do not threaten mate. However, Black's kingside is paralysed. His g7 pawn cannot move due to Qh7#, his rook cannot move around without losing material or getting mated, both knights have no useful squares to go on the kingside, etc.} g4 {Black attacks my rook.} 18. Rh4 {I move my rook to h4. I also threaten the g pawn, as the f pawn is pinned to the h7 square.} Nxe5 {? Black sacrifices his knight to open up the position and to allow his queen to infiltrate my kingside, but it also remove a potential defender of the king...} 19. dxe5 Qf2 {It is now Black's turn to threaten mate!} 20. Bg5 {! Combining attack and defence. Mate is no longer threatened due to the discovered defence of the rook. I also attack the knight, which is undefended.} Qxb2 {Black takes my pawn and threatens mate once again...} 21. Rb1 {I defend my rook whilst attacking the queen. The knight on e7 is still under attack.} Qa3 {Black moves his queen out of the way and protects his knight. Can you find the winning move for white?} 22. Bf6 {!! This move simply wins. I add an attacker to the g7 pawn, which can't be defended. My bishop cannot be taken as well; 22...gxf6 Qh7#, 22...Rxf6 23.exf6 and Black still has the same problems.} a6 {Black prevents a future Bb5, but the position is lost no matter what he does!} 23. Qh7+ {23.Qh8+ works here as well.} Kf7 24. Qxg7+ {Obviously.} Ke8 25. Rh7 {!! The finishing blow. Black resigned at this point, as he cannot prevent massive loss of material and mate. The knight cannot be properly defended, and it cannot move away either. If the knight moves, then 26.Qg6+ mates in two moves. (26...Rf7 27.Qxf7#) I black takes my bishop with his rook, Then I recapture the rook with my pawn and the black knight STILL can't move away from e7. 25...Rxf6 26.exf6 (26...Nc6 27.Rh8+ Qf8 28.Rxf8#) (26...Ng6 27.Qxg6+ Kd8 28.Qg8+ Qf8 29.Qxf8#) (26...Ng8 27.Qxg8+ Qf8 28.Re7+ Kd8 29.Qxf8#) If the black king tries to escape to the queenside, then Qf8 wins. Many thanks to my opponent for this great game!}
