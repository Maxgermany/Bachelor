1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 {Black wastes no time with prophylactic moves like ...a6, launching straight into a Dragon formation.} 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. f3 {I think this is a fairly standard approach to supporting the centre against the Dragon.  I was already contemplating queenside castling and a kingside storm against his castled position ...} O-O 8. Bc4 {I had three main thoughts when making this move: 1. to set up long term pressure on f7; 2. to help defend my eventually castled King; 3. not to occupy e2, which I anticipated would be needed by one of my knights.  I think this worked quite well, even though I did eventually lose.  I couldn't see any significant benefit in advancing to b5 now that Black had already castled.} d6 {This inhibits any thoughts White may have of advancing his e pawn and, more importantly, helps Black to develop his LSB.} 9. Qd2 {Prepares Q-side castling and facilitates an eventual Bh6, but perhaps I should first of all have swapped on c6 ...} Ne5 {! I hadn't expected this yet.  This N becomes a serious nuisance.  The initial threat is easily dealt with by retreating my B but soon I'm given more serious headaches.} 10. Bb3 Bd7 11. O-O-O {I was already having doubts about my strategy as Black was obviously going to exploit the half-open c-file and eventually create further threats with his fianchettoed B, but at this stage I thought he was equally well placed to attack a kingside castled position and I could soon launch my kingside attack.} Qa5 {Black immediately develops his Q aggressivel.y} 12. g4 {and I immediately try to launch my counter-attack (note that Black is already ahead with his attack as White will need several more moves to create any credible threats).} Rfc8 {! Black commits to an all-out attack on White's King's position.  I could already foresee an exchange sac on c3, which worried me considerably.} 13. Rdf1 {? Now, expecting to need to retreat the Nd4 to e2 in order to defend the Nc3, I mistakenly moved this rook to the f-file to over-defend the f-pawn so that I could play Ne2 with impunity.  Unfortunately, Black soon demonstrated that I had more important things to worry about and that the rook was needed on the d-file.  I couldn't afford this waste of tempi.} Nc4 {! I'd missed this response.  Now I must either give up my LSB for the N, or allow it to swap with my DSB, which I had planned to use for my attack.} 14. Qd3 Nxe3 15. Qxe3 Qc5 {! Another strong move that threatens to win my N with ...e5! as it will be pinned against my defenceless Q.  It also creates a battery on the c-file and gets out of the way of Black's a and b pawns, which are poised to storm White's position and harrass the defending minor pieces.} 16. Qd2 {My third Queen move in a row, returning to its core defensive position.  At this stage, although I was disappointed that I hadn't been able to discomfit Black in any way, I still felt that my position was tenable with careful play.} b5 {!  This threatens to dislodge my key Nc3.  In the meantime, it also restricts my Bb3's options.} 17. g5 {At last an attacking move!  Having weighed up my defensive options, I decided to stay put and not create any further weaknesses in my castled position (eg by playing 17.a3), but revert to plan A and dislodge his N before it could join his attack.  I was also thinking of advancing my f-pawn and didn't want to leave the g-pawn hanging if I did so.  Unfortunately there is an undesired consequence of forcing the N to move ...} Nh5 {The good thing was that I'd persuaded the N to the rim, where it became a spectator.  The bad things were that now my Nd4 was under immediate attack and I couldn't yet move my h-pawn without allowing him to fork my rooks from g3.} 18. Rfd1 {So my QR returned to d1, which it should never have left, to defend the N and avoid the potential fork.} a5 {Black resumes his attack ...} 19. a4 {I decided that I couldn't just let him advance his pawns without any opposition and I needed an escape hole for B or N.  However, I could see that my defending pawns were about to get exposed and the whole world could come crashing in ...} bxa4 {Now, I had to decide the correct response: I'd already decided that if I were to recapture, I'd have to use the N first because the B capture would result in mate or I'd have to give up a piece: 20. Bxa4 Bxa4 21. Nxa4 Bxd4 22. Qxd4 Qxc2#} 20. Nxa4 {Now, when I recapture on a4, my B will still be defending c2, albeit awkwardly.} Bxa4 21. Bxa4 Rab8 {! Now b2 also comes under pressure and Black is about to fork the Ba4 and Nd4 with this rook.} 22. h4 {? This irrelevant-looking move was played to enable me to improve my defence along the second rank ... but I had a more urgent problem to deal with, which I'd overlooked.} Rb4 {! How can I avoid losing a piece?  I couldn't see how: if 23. Bb3 Bxd4 24. Qxd4 Rxb3 25. Qxc5 Rxc5.  If 23. b3 (blocking my B's defence of c2) Bxd4 24. Qxd4 Qxc2#} 23. Nb3 {?! a desperate attempt to bamboozle my opponent ...  } Qe5 {!?  Threatening mate in one but I'd expected the cool 23. ...Rxa4, when 24. Nxc5 allows Ra1#} 24. c3 {Now I had to give up a piece but at least my King would have a hole for temporary respite.} Rxa4 25. Kb1 Rac4 {Now Black has 4 pieces attacking the pawn on c3, which is only defended by 2 and the path is clear for the a-pawn to advance as well.  I could see that it was only a matter of time now.} 26. Nd4 {Have I succeeded in blocking the attack?} a4 {Only temporarily, as now Black opens more lines.} 27. Rh2 {The move I'd planned when I played 22. h4.  I was aware at this point that I would need to make sure that I kept this rook defended but I also thought that I could cope with my Queen's over-commitment because to expolit it Black would have to use his own Queen to capture on d4, thereby relieving the threat to my rook...} a3 28. Ka2 axb2 29. Qxb2 Rc4xc3 {Now the threats seemed too numerous and horrible to contemplate in depth.  The worst seemed to involve losing my Queen or conceding mate but I found another way to lose...} 30. Qb6 {?? maintaining defence of my Nd4 and avoiding an immediate pin against my King, with the possible prospect of a back row check, but I'd forgotten something...} Qxh2+ {So I immediately resigned, a rook and a piece down with mate or further disastrous loss of material sure to follow: eg 31. Kb1 Bxd4 32. Qxd4 Qc2+ 33. Ka1 Ra8+ }
