1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Bc5 {She starts here with, "They are cranking out the first 6 moves like they are in a rush to meet the Queen! Carlsen just wants to mix things up a little and play chess, and hopefully avoid any crazy home prep by Caruana and his team."} 7. O-O O-O 8. d3 Re8 {Some fans are complaining that the games have been boring and not enough action. Their jobs is to try to win the match. For one, it is to hold on to his title, and the other wants to take it away. They are not in London to entertain the fans. They will do what they think is best.} 9. Bd2 Nxc3 10. Bxc3 Nd4 {This so far could not have been surprising to Carlsen, as Caruana quite predictably choose this line against the English lately. In fact, he played 8...Re8 back in April [Event "GCT Blitz Paris 2018"] [Date "2018.06.23"] [Round "8.5"] [White "So, W."] [Black "Caruana, F."] [Result "1/2-1/2"] 1 c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3.

Ke3 1/2-1/2 } 11. b4 Bd6 {Structurally, this is like a reversed Sicilian Dragon but where White has an extra tempo. 11. b4 is first deviation from the So-Caruana game. Yes, the position looks harmless, but Caruana must remain focus. This is exactly the type of position Carlsen wants, and he got it. Of course after 12. Nxd4 exd4 13. Bxd4 Black regains the Pawn right back after 13...Bxg3 14. hxg3 Qxd4.} 12. Rb1 {We are seeing the typical Magnus, avoiding the clash in the opening. The strategy seems clear. Carlsen wants a more "boring" type of positions where he can grind his opponent down with no risk. Caruana on the other hand wants more dynamic positions. So the hidden game is how to achieve those positions. } Nxf3+ 13. Bxf3 a6 {Let me tell you some behind the scene secrets in World Championship matches. It is a complete mind game. Before the match, the team of seconds will comb through all the opponent's games, especially the more recent ones. Their job is to find any kind of "weakness" or any kind of "struggle" in any type of positions in any opening. Then they will come up with a plan of what to prepare for, and work on surprises. Of course nothing is ever 100% correct because the other team also has surprises. So it is up to the players themselves, arm with all the preparation, to figure out where the potential home prep landmines are, then try to avoid it.  This is why someone like Carlsen, who believes in his middlegame and endgame strength, prefers to go around deep theories, and just play chess. So sometimes when you see the players "think" in what seems to be non-complicated positions, it means they are trying to figure out what the opponents prepared for them and how to avoid it.} 14. a4 {White's goal is to break through with b4-b5 at the right moment and ideally trade of all the Queenside pawns, leaving only Black's b7 pawn as a target. However if immediately 15. b5 Black could respond with 15...cxb5 16. axb5 a5 } c6 {I expect b5 to come soon from Carlsen. I like his position, very easy and straight forward to play without any risk. Black has to work on equalizing. Very smart choice by Carlsen and his team.} 15. Re1 {Perhaps a little too cautious? I would have played 15. b5. Hard to understand.  Another thing many fans at home fail to understand is at this level, one mistake can cost them the match. Very few players can play like Tal and win World Championships today, especially with the vast improvement of computer power. Unsound moves & ideas will be severely punished immediately. } Bd7 16. e3 Qf6 17. Be4 {White is not better or worse, only equal, and Carlsen is fine with that. He relies on space advantage and his incredible patience. He is counting on Caruana making inaccuracies in this type of position. But objectively speaking, the position is equal. } Bf5 {And now if 18. Qf3 Bxe4 19. Qxf6 gxf6 20. dxe4 =/+= Equal and relaxing endgame with little risk.} 18. Qf3 Bxe4 19. Qxf6 gxf6 20. dxe4 {as expected. Now the chances of a drawn endgame is 99% with 0.9% winning chances for Carlsen, and 0,1% for Caruana in case if Carlsen over pushes. } b5 21. Red1 {Carlsen will try to make some plays against Caruana's Queenside pawn. The problem is even if he can trade his 2 pawns for 3, Black can still hold on the Kingside a pawn down. So the likeliness of a decisive result is slim, very slim. Of course anything is possible.} Bf8 {Now Carlsen has two options, to trade the a pawn for b, or leave it be and allowing black to play bxa4. However, he cannot play a5 as this will put his b4 and a5 pawns on dark squares where Black Biship can attack them.} 22. axb5 axb5 {So Carlsen decided to trade his a for b pawn. Black has a weak c6 pawn while white has a b4 target with his own pawn. } 23. Kg2 {Carlsen can try to squeeze but this game will head to another draw.} Kg7 24. Rdc1 Red8 25. Be1 Rdc8 26. Rc2 {It will be hard for White to make much progress. But that never stopped Carlsen from trying to squeeze water from stone before. I highly doubt that it will work against Caruana though.} Ra4 27. Kf3 {Black can just play Kg6 and sit tight as White cannot really do much.} h5 28. Ke2 Kg6 29. h3 {Carlsen wants to bring his King to the other side. But the potential problem is the Black King can get in via g4. So h3 stops it for now. Still equal and still heading toward another draw.  A slew of moves to simplify things even further } f5 30. exf5+ Kxf5 31. f3 Be7 {Neither side can really make much progress without crazy risk. So the game is still moving right along toward a peaceful end. } 32. e4+ Ke6 33. Bd2 Bd6 {I understand that the players are shuffling pieces and making moves.  But, I cannot find a single plan to give either side any advantage of or winning chances.  The white smoke went up!  } 34. Rbc1 {and Carlsen offered a draw, and it was promptly accepted by Caruana.  So what is my conclusion?  I think 15. b5 offered some small advantage for Carlsen. 15. Re1 was too passive which allowed Caruana to consolidate.  The score after 4 games is 2-2! }
