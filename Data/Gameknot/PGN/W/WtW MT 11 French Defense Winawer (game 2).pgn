1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 {Starting position for the MT.} Bxc3+ { } 6. bxc3 { } Qc7 {This time it's my turn to threaten the fork!} 7. Qg4 { } f5 { } 8. Qh5+ { } g6 { } 9. Qd1 { } cxd4 {I now realize the significance of 9. Qd1. He can protect his rook from the fork and threaten my queen simultaneously.} 10. cxd4 {It just looks so inviting!} Qc3+ {Hi} 11. Bd2 { I think that taking the d4 pawn may just be worth the trouble. I know he'll be chasing my queen, but I didn't see how it would get trapped easily.} Qxd4 {Even though I've captured the pawn, the GK analysis still shows white is winning by a slight margin (0.25)... Why?} 12. Nf3 { } Qe4+ {Because I can.} 13. Be2 { } Ne7 { If only the pinned bishop helped me in some way.} 14. O-O { } Qa4 {Exit stage right} 15. Bg5 { } Nec6 { Didn't really like blocking the queen out, but I wanted to castle.} 16. Bf6 { } O-O { } 17. Qd2 {That f6 bishop is really bothering, I must do something there quickly.} Nd7 {First time I'm green in the analysis (you can see it if you look REALLY close)} 18. Qg5 {Hmmm...} Qxc2 {More green... wait, really?} 19. Bb5 { } a6 {I should have just taken the bishop at f6.} 20. Rac1 { } Qe4 {I missed the better move Qb2, but I'm going to trade queens now and I need to hustle.} 21. Bxc6 { } Nxf6 {To late.} 22. Bxb7 {I didn't understand why black didn't take with the pawn instead, but I was ok with this alternative.} Bxb7 { } 23. Rc7 {Yea, this isn't looking good now.} Qg4 {Let me do the trade and get this over with.} 24. Rxb7 { } Qxg5 { } 25. Nxg5 {His king is all snug in his pawns and I'm getting beat up. I need to get some offense going.} Nh5 {Go forth pesky knight.} 26. Nxe6 {I see here if I move my rook to e8, there is an attractive looking fork play for white. However, it involves blocking his rook's view of the 7th row with his knight. When the sequence is over, his knight will be stuck in the corner.} Rfe8 { } 27. Nc7 {The intended fork.} Re7 {I thought this was a pretty cool move.} 28. Nxa8 { } Rxb7 {Now the knight has no where to go until the rook moves.} 29. g3 {White signals he's ready to move his rook out.} Rb2 {I think this move lost me the game. Analysis shows Ng7 preferred. It seems like Re7 would have been better. Would value opinions here.} 30. Rd1 {I should not have gotten greedy for that pawn.} Ra2 { } 31. Rxd5 { } Rxa3 { } 32. Nc7 { } a5 {Like that pawn will ever make it... Ha!} 33. Rd8+ { } Kg7 { } 34. Rd7+ { } Kg8 { } 35. e6 {Regretting not dealing with the passed pawn now.} Kf8 {The blunder that sealed black's fate!} 36. e7+ { } Kg7 { } 37. e8=Q+ { } Kh6 { } 38. Qf8+ { } Kg5 { } 39. h4+ { } Kg4 { } 40. Rd4+ { } Kh3 {  I decide to attack, hoping for an opponent blunder....} 41. Qxa3 { But that hope is gone now as well.} f4 { } 42. gxf4+ { } Kg4 { } 43. f5+ { } Kxf5 { } 44. Qc5+ { } Kf6 { } 45. Qg5+ { } Kf7 { } 46. Rd7+ {I resign here because I finally see the mate(2).  Thanks Steven for the opportunity to play. I learned much more about this variation and excited to practice this out in the remaining MT games.}
