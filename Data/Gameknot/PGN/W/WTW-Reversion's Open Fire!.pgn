1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {Pretty conventional, except that reversion recommended that I try different things.  Well, he played this against me, in our second game.  So, I wanted to see where this would go.} Nf6 {Standard development, whilst, threatening my Ne4.} 3. Nc3 {So, I protect and develop.} Bc5 {Development is also what he has in mind.} 4. Nf3 {I continue.} d6 {So does he as his Bc8 is now ready for action, plus that pawn chain means something to me.} 5. O-O {Seeing nothing wrong with it, I go ahead with it and castle.} Bg4 {So, he pins.} 6. Be2 {So, I break the pin in the most common way.  I don't like the looks of 6.h2 as well since that would appear to weaken my K when he as 6...Bh6  So, it's about sticking with what you know.} Nc6 {Continuing with his development.} 7. b3 {And, I decide to just go for it and fianchetto.  The thing is that I was feeling a little pressure being unsure of whether to play this or d3 since pressure is about not knowing what to do.  Under that condition, I just go by what my heart tells me to do.  So, I went for it and played this.} a6 {Getting a semi open file.} 8. Bb2 {But, it's of no concern to me since I don't feel pressure.  Therefore, I just follow up on the plan behind the fianchetto which was this move, as now, I have a nice long diagnol for my Bishop.} O-O {Not to my surprise, he castles.} 9. Ng5 {And, I bring my N to a more comfortable.  In part, I want and am more then happy to exchange here.  Of course, that was before the first lesson with Ken on when it's safe to exchange.  It still will happen, where I, occasionally make a mistake which is why instead of borrowing that book, I'll try to google, I believe it's You Fan's book on endgames, based on, if exchanging will work.  Back then, when I wasn't too sure, as is here, I just go by what my instincts and nothing else.  In this case, it was to exchange since Jack Stockel's advise was to exchange often against stronger players.  The big problem was, that after the lesson, I misunderstood the entire interpretation.  He didn't mean in general, just because you can.  Instead, Jack was, specifically, alluding to against Tom because Tom is the kind of player that likes to avoid exchanges which is how he often forces those wins.  One time, I got a draw just by keeping that in mind, when he made a blunder and lost the Queen for Rook.} Bxe2 10. Qxe2 Nd4 {Exchanging, though, might not have been the best idea as I didn't see this attack coming.  On the other hand, I'm more comfortable with my position then before and don't feel pressure, as this is what I believe my opponent wants.} 11. Qd3 {With that idea that my Queen and pawn were forked.  Probably figuring that I'd need to calculate.  But, in this context, that plan did not work as I knew how to handle that situation.  Just bring the Queen here and he doesn't get anything, in return.} Nh5 {Overlooking the discovered attack.  As now, I'm forced to protect on the rim.  Similar to my first game against a certain character, my N is now cramped there.  That's because there will be not other squares available without losing the N.  The beginning of where not calculating enough causes problem.  But, there's still plenty of fight.  It's not until much later on that I really go wrong.} 12. Nh3 Ne6 {Presumably, he wants to put pressure on my Nh3 and threaten a K exposure.} 13. Qf3 {Which I stop by attacking his Nh5.} g6 {Protecting this is in an unusual matter since I thought that he would retreat.} 14. Rae1 {Feeling just a little bit of pressure, I just go for it, again, by centralizing my Rook since that's generally a good idea.  The real question is if it works out, in this position.  I think so since everything appears fine, so far.} c6 {I'm not sure why he played this.} 15. Nd1 {Feeling that he'll try to pressure my N with ...Nd4, at some point due to the half pin, I just bring it back, before problems can arise.} Nhg7 {Bringing his Nh5 to a better outpost.} 16. Ne3 {And, I bring my N to a better place, as well.} f5 {He is planning an attack on my Ne3 which I stop by exchanging for a second time.} 17. exf5 gxf5 18. Nd1 {Preventing 18...f4.} Qf6 {Bringing in an attacker with his Queen.} 19. Nc3 {Unlike before, I'm willing to risk that pin because of what I believe is developing before me.  He takes advantage with that half pin.  This time, I was concerned about 19...e4  After which, he might try and formulate a calculation for pinning the Queen.  This wouldn't happen soon, but I'm thinking in terms of a very long term variation since it's about thinking about thinking and planning ahead.  So, as far as, I'm concerned, I am just stopping a problem before it starts.  Another way of saying this is preventing a problem.} Bd4 {But, on the second thought, this isn't a pin.  My thinking is that he wanted to apply pressure on me.  My attitude is that it, if this is what he was thinking, pointless, since I don't feel any pressure.  However, it's not pressure that he wanted.  Therefore, it has to be something that I'm missing.} 20. Ba3 {Figuring that his plan didn't work, I decide to attack his d6.  Calculating his next move and I formulate my plan for afterward.} Rad8 21. Ne2 {?? Which is this move.  But, it's the decisive blunder which I overlook.  I felt that this was the only mistake in the whole game, but against an opponent, especially a runner, one mistake is all that it takes.  As now, he is going to get my Queen, one way or another, without compensation.  Just about anything was better then this as the N prevented his next move from coming.} e4 22. Qg3 {Attempting to protect my Queen.} f4 23. Qg4 {And, that attempt is still continuing.} h5 {This is where I realized that the Queen is a goner.  But, my attitude is that if he wins my Queen, I'll get something for it.  The only thing is that it's not enough compensation.  So, I'd normally resign, but since it's a WTW game, due to their rules, resignation is not an option until mate is forced.  So, then the idea becomes lasting as long as possible.  At first, I thought that I might tie or break that 36 move which isn't going to happen here.  BTW, move length, although Ken has a good point on that is something that easy19 emphasizes (and it's one reason that the WTW club has a rule about resignation.)  However, my thought process was also wrong because I don't get any compensation.  Through a bunch of exchanges, he also gets my N, after I take his.} 24. Nxd4 hxg4 25. Nxe6 Nxe6 26. Rxe4 gxh3 27. g3 {Without a good move left, I play this.  I also considered 27.gxh3, but it would be mate shortly after 27...Rg7+} fxg3 28. fxg3 {?? So, I took back figuring that I got a pawn back with the discovered attack on his Queen.  But, it's mate.  The only thing that would've worked was letting his pawn remain where it was and allowing ...g2.  Now, the Rook moves back, but I'm pretty sure that it's still with ...Qf2+, with Kh1 (forced), and then ...Qg2#  So, I wouldn't have lasted 36 moves but would become close to that.  I also, like with itchnyscratchy didn't think the next move was mate.  Except that, I overlooked his Rook behind Queen.} Qxf1# {What this game shows is to judge carefully because it only takes one mistake to lose the game which I think is what happened here.}
