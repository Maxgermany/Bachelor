1. Nf3 {White chooses a quiet system of development, postponing the struggle for the center till he's fully developed.} Nf6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 c6 {Not my usual cup of tea but it's a good system as it blocks the white Bishop on g2.} 4. d3 Bg4 {Getting the Bishop outside of the pawn chain.} 5. Nbd2 {White could have played more active with 5.Ne5 but instead he simply develops another piece. His position is solid and reminiscent of KID, the only difference being that d5 is heavily secured by pawns.} Nbd7 6. O-O e5 7. e4 {The standard KID advance.} dxe4 8. dxe4 {Exchanging is good because I don't have a hole at d5. White's Bg2 is slightly passive now.} Bc5 {The best place for this Bishop, on d6 it would block the d-file and on e7 it would be passive.} 9. h3 {Tempting me to exchange on f3.} Bh5 {I decline because g4 would leave White's castle weak on dark squares. White still hasn't fully develop. He can't play his Nd2 because e4 would be undefended. Trying to defend it with Re1 would allow Black to activate his Queen on b6, targeting f2.} 10. c3 {Not really impressed with this move. Among other things it weakens d3.} O-O 11. Qe2 {Defending e4 in preparation of developing the Bc1.} a5 {Now that Nb3 could be played, I make room for my Bishop at a7, where it sits better than on b6 because it doesn't stop any pawn from advancing.} 12. g4 {Breaking the pin. On a side note, White was wise to wait playing this until I castled or else I could have used the g-pawn to active my Rh8 with a direct attack on the h-file.} Bg6 13. Nh4 {Now that f5 is a potential outpost, White brings the Knight to it. He also clears the f-pawn to advance.} a4 {Not allowing Nb3. This move will have another advantage later on.} 14. Nf5 Qc7 {It's generally a mistake to exchange a Knight in a similar position, and here in particular. White would get a mass of mobile pawns on the K-side and his Bishop's diagonal would open up. From c7 the Queen covers d6, overprotects e5 and makes room for a potential Rook to come to d8.} 15. Nc4 {Preparing to develop the Bc1 and threatening to come to d6 should I drop my guard.} h5 {Starting a tactical storm. I believed my position was good enough to start active maneuvers at once. I wanted to get rid of Nf5 before it did any real damage.} 16. g5 {The most active reply.} Nd5 {I didn't like Nh7, it looked to passive so I chose a more risky continuation.} 17. exd5 {17.Nxg7 would have given White the initiative.} Bxf5 {I'm glad to have gotten rid of this Knight even at the cost of weakening my pawn structure.} 18. dxc6 bxc6 19. Be3 {19.Qxh5 fails to Bd3. That's one practical drawback of White's 10th.} Bxe3 20. Nxe3 Bg6 21. Bf3 {Starting an ill-conceived plan to win a pawn. Better would have been Nc4, exploiting the weak dark squares.} e4 {Creating an outpost on e5, opening a dangerous diagonal against the White King, clearing the 5th rank, creating a weak spot at f3, this pawn advance is one multipurpose move. It also invites White to take the h5 pawn.} 22. Bxh5 {Retreating to g2 would have still left Black better because of aforementioned ideas behind e4, this wins a pawn at the cost of losing a castle defender.} Bxh5 23. Qxh5 Ne5 {Threatening mate in two. Black has more than enough for the pawn.} 24. Ng4 {White had attacking ideas of his own. If it wasn't for the mate threat, White could threaten mate himself with Nf6+. But the Knight is tied to the defense of h2.} Nf3+ {I felt that Black was winning once I managed to get my Knight to f3.} 25. Kh1 {Kg2 was stronger because he could defend h2 with a Rook and start activity on his own.} Ra5 {Good thing my pawn was on a4. Now Rxg5 is the threat, trapping the Queen.} 26. h4 {No other way of defending g5. But now the Ng4 is less secure and and h4 pawn is also weak.} Rf5 {Now not only Rf4 is threatened but g6 as well. White's K-side is in shambles. His attacking pieces are huddled in a corner and his King is feeling the cold shiver of mate.} 27. Rfg1 {Offering the exchange for the Nf3 and attacking prospects.} g6 {This traps the Queen as after 28.Qh6 Rf4, White can't save his Queen without getting matted.}
