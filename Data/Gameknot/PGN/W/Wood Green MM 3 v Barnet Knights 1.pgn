1. d4 {This annotation makes a lot more sense if you quickly play through these annotations first,- http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/shropshire-2-v-sandhurst-cadets-4ncl?gm=62242 http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/shropshire-2-v-wood-green-mm3?gm=62262 So having drawn with Robert Akeya-Price, after we had looked at our game, I asked him how he beat Thomas Villiers, and he showed me.} d5 2. c4 e6 {So it starts as a Queen's Gambit.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 {Robert turns it into a Catalan Opening - quite an unusual choice for one so young! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Opening} dxc4 {Black takes the pawn. Of course Robert could immediately regain the pawn with 5. Qa4+, but he is in no hurry, and calmly continues with his development.} 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. Qa4 {And now Robert plans to recapture the pawn.} Nd5 {This is slightly unusual. I tend to think that black should continue with his development.} 7. Qxc4 {So white gets the pawn back.} Na5 {Again - I can't help thinking that black should be getting on with his development, rather than playing this.} 8. Qa4+ {Robert told me that he was expecting his opponent to play either Nc6 or c6.} Bd7 {This was a bit of a shock. Of course 9. Qxa5?? Bb4+ and black gets a queen for two pieces.} 9. Qd1 {But the queen is quite comfortable here.} c5 {Black does a thematic attack on the white centre.} 10. O-O {White calmly castles.} Be7 {Black at last develops his Bf8.} 11. Ne5 {Knight takes up a dominating square in the centre.} cxd4 {I don't like this move either - castling or Nc6 seems better - but Fritz likes this move.} 12. Qxd4 {White recaptures, threatening to take twice on d5.} Qb6 {This is a blunder - simply castling was best - the Catalan Bishop on g2 is so strong, it is worth giving up pawn and knight to get rid of it. OK what would you play here as white?} 13. Qg4 {How many players, facing an opponent graded 56 ECF grading points ahead of them would have taken off the queens? Quite a few I fancy! But Roberts took his time and played the strongest move. Black is in all sorts of trouble now, as 14. Bxd5 is threatened, and if black recaptures with the e pawn white can take the bishop on d7. Or white could play the moves in another order - 14. Nxd7 and if black plays Kxd7 then white has 15. Bxd5. Meanwhile white is also threatening 15. Qxg7.} Bb5 {Black finds the best defence.} 14. Qxg7 {So the pawn goes.} O-O-O {Materially down, black sacrifices again, pinning everything on a king side counter-attack, hoping to take advantage of white's undeveloped queen-side. I would expect that black realised that objectively Rf8 was the best move, but 0-0-0 unbalances the position and has practical chances.} 15. Nxf7 {White correctly takes the offered material.} Rhg8 {Black attacks the white queen - it is the only way to save the exchange.} 16. Qxh7 {But at the cost of a third pawn.} Rdf8 {but both black's rooks now have nice open files against the white king.} 17. Bxd5 {Robert again plays the best move, removing black's best placed piece.} exd5 {Black takes back.} 18. Nh6 {and now, white is threatening both the Be7 and the Rg8.} Bc5 {Once again, black pins his hopes on counter-attack, hoping to confuse his young opponent. Either 18.... Qe6 or 18.....Rh8 lose less material, but offer little in the way of long-term chances.} 19. Nxg8 {So white takes.} Bxe2 {Black takes, threatening the only protector of f2. Dispite being materially down, black's counter-attack looks dangerous.} 20. Bf4 {Cool play from the youngster! Robert blocks the f file and prevents black's king from running to g8.} Bxf1 {So white recaptures some material.} 21. Kxf1 {White takes back.} Rxf4 {And black sacrifices yet again! Black correctly removes one of white's best placed pieces and damages white's king side pawn formation.} 22. gxf4 {So white takes back.} Qxb2 {Black is rook and pawn down, but he is going to regain the rook on a1 surely?} 23. Qf5+ {No! Robert has prepared a clever defence, showing that not only can he attack, he can also defend accurately.Now if Kd8 24. Qf6+ forces the queens off.} Kb8 {So the black king went this way.} 24. Qe5+ {and now this fork does the business!} Qxe5 {So black is forced to trade queens.} 25. fxe5 {White takes back.} Bd4 {But black is still winning the rook in the corner surely?} 26. Nc3 {This wins - although 26. e6! was even stronger.} Bxc3 {So black took.} 27. Rd1 {White attacks the d pawn, but again, 27. e6! was even better.} Bxe5 {Black is happy to exchange pawns - if he can trade all the pawns and the knights King & Bishop v King and Rook is usually a draw.} 28. Rxd5 {White forks black's pieces.} Nc6 {But black has a resource.} 29. h4 {This is a powerful outside pawn.} Kc7 {King comes over - but he can't go far.} 30. h5 {Meanwhile Robert correctly advances his h pawn "passed pawns must be pushed".} Bh8 {So his opponent rushes to block it.} 31. f4 {But Robert has a second ace up his sleeve!} Nb4 {Black tries to fight back, forking white's rook and a pawn.} 32. Rd2 {This protects both.} Bc3 {And now the rook is attacked again.} 33. Re2 {Robert cleverly prevents the black king from coming across to block the passed pawns which threaten to advance.} Kd6 {The king comes across one square anyway.} 34. Ne7 {This manoeuvre ensures that black will have to sacrifice his bishop on h8. I am sure against an opponent of his own grade and age Thomas Villiers would resign at this point, but in a time-honoured tradition, going back to at least "The Game of the Century"  Donald Byrne v 13-year-old Bobby Fischer, Rosenwald Memorial Tournament in New York City on October 17, 1956, Thomas sportingly plays on, allowing his young opponent to mate him with a humble pawn. I will therefore just include the move, without any more comments.} a5 35. h6 Bf6 36. h7 b5 37. Ng6 a4 38. h8=Q Bxh8 39. Nxh8 a3 40. f5 Nd5 41. Re6+ Kd7 42. Ng6 b4 43. Ne5+ Kc7 44. Rc6+ Kb7 45.
