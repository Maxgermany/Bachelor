1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {I have been trying different things but am most used to the Ruy Lopez.  And, now, I don't mind playing against it, either.  The next two moves are standard.} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 {But, I had anticipated 4...b5, after which, I'd respond with 5.Bb3  That's what most of them have played.  I could delay castling, as I learned with tipsyjourneyman with something like 5.Nc3 to continue developing.  But, given that I'm trying different things, as per reversion's suggestions and being most comfortable with castling next, I'll go by what my heart tells me.  That's because GM Susan Polgar has also told me to play what I'm most comfortable.  Quite frankly, before being given that advice it's one of the main ways as I've improved.  Back in the day, I changed my thought process in a way that I wasn't comfortable with, as per a coaches advice.  That, however, hindered my improvement and was a reason for reaching my lowest rating of 851. So, after going back to square one (where I was most comfortable), that's what helped me surpass the 1000 mark.  And, it's another reason for me coaching and mentoring players with another idea being that the students are comfortable.  Not only that, but one or two of them have also improved from that alone. } 5. O-O Be7 {I'm not sure why he needed to prevent the pin.  For me it would not have been a concern because if white were able to push d2 and play Bg5, it would be then that I play this and not before.  As black, however, I would've played 5...Bc5  Yes, this is, generally speaking, considered to be an inaccuracy.  But, despite the pawn chains, I would not be afraid of c3-d4, which is generally what you'd want to avoid.  Instead, it would be part of my plan, as then, I'd answer with ...Bb6 and feel comfortable about my position.} 6. Nc3 {Meanwhile, I develop.  But, I did not play this for the thrill and giggles of that since the idea is not being hyperfocused on chess quotes.  Instead, I, simply feel more comfortable and am just more used to it due to playing Two Knight's Opening, and Four Knight's Defense.  Although it's not that opening with the bishops being moved, it's too similar for me to consider any other move.} b5 {But, this move is what I thought he'd play earlier.  So, my response must be the same.  At first, I was asking myself what black was trying to prove.  Though, I voided out that question because he's a runner.  Therefore, he keeps me guessing.  But, that's what chess is supposed to be about. } 7. Bb3 d6 {Jack Stockel often plays this but earlier.  I figured him out as his Bc8 can become a real menace, in this position.  So, it's something that I must now be aware of.} 8. d3 {Knowing what he might do, I have the same idea, in mind.} Na5 {Trying to exchange my B for N.  But, when that intention is obvious this early then we know that a bishop is worth more.} 9. Bd5 {So, I don't allow it and respond by attacking his Ra8.} c6 {But, he counterattacks.  But, the idea is to castle as that's what he'll do, when I protect.} 10. Bb3 O-O 11. Be3 {And, that's when I decide to complete my development.} Bg4 {But, I overlooked this pin, as otherwise, 11.Nd2 would've been played. } 12. Qe2 {Knowing that it can't be broken without opening up my monarch (after what happened in the horrible loss against Jack), I decide to mobilize my Queen.} d5 {He opts for an exchange, which I accept.  That's because I'm pretending that I have an advantage.  In reality, however, I'm well aware that it's level.  But, my idea is lasting, as long as, possible.  The goal is 26 since that's how well in the hardest level of Wizard Chess.  And, as noted, I accomplish my goal with this unusual attitude.  It's unusual because one of my mentors said that I wouldn't improve much especially since I'm deviating from some of what he told me.  Therefore, the thought process is actually what he has outlined.  But, as noted, it's what I'm most comfortable, and by thinking this way, I get a very good game, in this context and am, thus, proud of myself.  It's not that often that I can think the way I enjoy (my style) and play so well against someone of this strength.} 13. exd5 Nxb3 14. axb3 cxd5 15. Bg5 {So, I go after his N, before he had a chance to fork my Be3 and Nc3.} b4 {But, this move was still anticipated.} 16. Nd1 {This was the only choice.  However, there is another move that I considered which no onelse would've have.  And, that was placing it on the rim with 16.Na4  This would've been better, believe it or not.  But, I was afraid of losing my Knight, after 16...Qa5  However, if I played, let's supposed, 17.Nc5, I've got a nice discovered attack on his Queen.  Afterwhich, I'd be able to protect my Knight.} h6 {I was surprised to see him play this.} 17. Bd2 {?? So, I retreat thinking that I'm still safe.  But, I overlooked the story that the board was telling me which is important.  I originally thought that I was safe, and it's even, bottom line.  But, the problem is the pinned Knight.  With that, I'm now bound to lose a piece.  Best was 17.Bxf6, and after 17...Bxf6, or 17...gxf6, 18.h4, and now it can retreat, or we continue with 18...Bxf3, 19.Qxf3, where it remains level.  By playing this, he gets the initiative, without compensation.} e4 18. dxe4 dxe4 19. Ne3 exf3 {As, this is the consequence of playing 17.Bd2??} 20. gxf3 Bh3 21. Rfd1 {Protecting my Rook.  Sure, I'm down a piece for pawn.  But, I'm confident that I still have a way to go.  Usually, I'm wrong, but this time, my instincts were spot on.} Qb6 {Trying to win material because his intention is to play 22...Bc5, after which, I go down another pawn.} 22. Nc4 {Therefore, I don't allow it and counterattack.} Qc6 {I'm not intimidated by this, as otherwise, I'd retreat.  As a result, I'm going to apply what I learned from Jack Stockel which is that part of K safety is bringing it into the corner.  It applies here since his target is g1.  We know, as otherwise, he would not have left his Be7 en-prise.  That's because I thought about taking it but realized that, especially, in this position, "To take is a mistake" because of how the game is developing.  Afterall, his intentions are 23...Nh5, followed by, 24...Qg7+, 25.Kh1 (forced), Qg2#  I had a similar threat against Jack Stockel with his two pins and then Tom.  The moral to both games is that the monarch has to land in the corner, when you have a threat like this.} 23. Kh1 Rfe8 {Now that the threat is gone, he protects.} 24. Be3 {And, I go on the offense since my idea is putting pressure on his Nf6 with 25.Bd4.} Nd5 {Which, not to my surprise, he prevents.  But, I was planning on this move because what I'm about to do.} 25. Rd4 {? As the plan is doubling up on the d file.  But, I overlooked something better which would've helped me last even longer, possibly, over 36 moves.  Much better was 25.Rd3, as now, I'm forced to liquidate.  } Bc5 26. Na5 {?? But, I thought it could be prevented with this move since his Queen is now under siege.  Therefore, my thought was him retreating and my next move being 27.Rd3, or 27.Rd2  By playing this, I wind up losing my Rook for a Bishop and a pawn, in addition to, what I've already lost.} Qg6 {That's due to the mate threat he has on g2.  With that there's no other way out because 27.Bg5?? loses an additional piece.  Afterwhich, the same thing that happens now, would've occurred a move after, putting me, in much worse shape.} 27. Rg4 Bxg4 28. fxg4 Nxe3 29. fxe3 Rxe3 30. Qg2 {Feeling that, aside from loss of material, my position is safe I try to protect, whilst, attempting counterplay due to his Ra8 being attacked.} Rae8 {After protecting, however, I start to figure out that there's a little more to this story then meets the eye.  I didn't how bad, until the next move.} 31. Qf1 Qe4+ {But, this is when I realize the full damage and figure out that I'm lost.  But, wanting to come closer, and possibly, break the record, I'm not ready to resign, despite mate being forced.} 32. Qg2 {The only other option was 32.Kg1, anticipating 32...Rg3# figuring it would be an exchange.  But, after analyzing, I figured out that it's mate due to his Bc5.  } Re1+ 33. Rxe1 Qxe1+ {This, however, is where I resign because he'll mate.  As now, 34.Qg1 is forced, allowing 34...Qxg1#  Once again, I'm proud of how long I lasted.  And, this shows that despite my ratings remaining the same for the last few months, that I have improved.  That's because, I lasted 23 moves, in my last game against easy19.  Shortly after that, I lasted 26 moves in the recent Wizard Chess.  I'm confident that, sooner then later, I'll be able to surpass that 36 mark, and even, make it to 40 moves against strong opposition, like this.}
