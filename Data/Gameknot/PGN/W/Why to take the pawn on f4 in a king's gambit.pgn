1. e4 {Hello and welcome to my annotated game. This game is played by someone I know from school (oogiegork) and shows that it can be dangerous game if there is a king gambit played, and this shows what can happen even if you don't take the pawn on f4!} e5 2. f4 {Like I said, there is a king gambit.} f6 {I personally think that you should not do this because moving a kingside pawn in a opening is dangerous, even when you can take the pawn on f4 and defend badly on the next few moves. But these players are better than me, so I cannot talk.} 3. fxe5 {Black thinks that white is offering a fair exchange.} fxe5 {And so he takes the pawn on e5} 4. Qh5+ {However, this has turned out that it was not a fair exchange after all! For not only he moved a kingside pawn, he also captured a piece, leaving a path where white can check black, making it unable to castle for the rest of the game and take the pawn on e5 next move (fork).} Ke7 5. Qxe5+ {And not only white took the pawn on e5, he has got the black king on the run!} Kf7 {Black must be in agony :)} 6. Bc4+ Kg6 7. Qf5+ {At this point, balck resigned perhaps because of agony. Thank you for watching this annotated game, and please rate this game, and good luck on all your current and future matches :)}
