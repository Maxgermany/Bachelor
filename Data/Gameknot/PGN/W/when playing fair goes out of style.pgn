1. e4 {a standard move.} c5 {my standard move.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 {this move is to get black questionably about whether if he should wait for white to go back into the books (like d4)} a6 {i wait} 4. a4 {this move is a move for the future} Nc6 5. d4 {so i still went d4.} cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nf6 7. Bc4 {white is slightly better} e6 8. O-O Be7 9. Be3 O-O {king safety.} 10. Qe2 Qc7 11. f4 {a standard move for white in the Sicilian } b6 12. f5 Nxd4 13. Bxd4 d5 {! best!! this opens up the board.} 14. exd5 exf5 15. Be5 Qc5+ 16. Kh1 Bd7 {still developing.} 17. Rad1 Qxc4 {you might find this move odd, but i moved there because what happen was he had his bishop on the corner of the c4 square so i said adjust quietly ( so i would not disturb the other players in the tournament) and since no one heard me say that i was forced to take the bishop.  i finished the game and lost but i don't see why to annotate the rest.  please comment and rate it on the star system.}
