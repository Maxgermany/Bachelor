[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 {Avoiding c4 and my Budapest-at-test. This is not a good move for white, but it is not straight forward to prove it. } b6 {Passively taking a good diagonal. But white has few problems coping with that. The fianchetto has the disadvantage of being announced, so the opponent has time to move according to it. } 3. e4 {Already threatening an annoying e5.} d6 {Well, this must be a mistake, but let's my opponent prove it. } 4. Bg5 {A doubled pawn is not a problem in this position, even if he cramps me a little. } Nbd7 {The bishop has to go to b7 anyway. } 5. Bb5 {Foreseen. } Bb7 {Now I threaten c6. He can take the knight and the other one and double my pawns... so what?} 6. Bxf6 exf6 7. d5 {Good move, in order to control my bishop. Ok. But...} a6 {The bishop will be chased away (or exchanged) anyway from the other side. I don't bother to advance the a and b pawns here. Should I?} 8. Bd3 {Now my knight seems to have a nice post on e5, but I must be careful since it can be kicked away with f4. NxB, under this circumstance, is not a wise move, since the white bishop is still almost useless. } g6 {...and it will bite on granite. Moreover, I leave room for my dsb to h6. A pretty unusual development scheme. } 9. Nf3 {Here white should have played f4. } Bh6 10. O-O {I have plenty of pieces on the kingside, and if he doesn't free them with e5 very soon, his pieces would be less active than mine. } Ne5 {Preparing a free way for the lsb. } 11. Nxe5 fxe5 {Now my pawns are ok, and white's kingside is weak. } 12. Qg4 Bc8 {...because of this. } 13. Qf3 O-O {Here, castling is an attacking move. The break in f5 is on the agenda. } 14. a4 f5 15. exf5 Bxf5 16. Ne4 Qd7 {Reinforcing my dominiom of the white square, and supporting the strong-looking Bg4. Why I choosed this instead of many other ways to proceed? A good question. It was pure instinct, I must be sincere. Was I right?} 17. Ng3 Bg4 {If BxB, the queen just retakes, and black has just an edge. This way I looked for something more active... and I prepared it before!} 18. Qe4 Rf4 {It looks like a trapped queen, but it's not. Now, I must confess I was at a loss. } 19. Qe1 {Black has clearly an edge. His undeveloped position after Bc8 became a very active and threatening one. But how to cash the win?} Raf8 {? This was a blunder. I'm not really threatening a target. a6 can be uninportant, but... Re8 instead would have been more intersting, since in case of Bxa6 black can demolish white with e5. } 20. h3 {Anyway, my opponent spared me of a nice midgame fight with this move. I couldn't allow to retire my bishop. I "had" to demostrate that my intuition about the bishop right there had a meaning. } Bxh3 {I found it... or so I believed! Was I right?} 21. gxh3 Qxh3 {Now, nothing can stop the mate. Am I right?} 22. Be4 {Not certainly this move. But the strange thing is that white has TWO tempoes, and he still can't do anything! Poor white didn't expect this, for sure! } Rh4 {And mate in one. White was caught in a "hard to see" countermove, but it would be interesting to analyze his opening and where it went wrong. Thank you for reading, and back to work! :-)}
