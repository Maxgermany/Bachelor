1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. e3 {a weak third move by White} Bg7 4. Nf3 O-O 5. Bd3 d6 6. h3 {to prevent Bg4, but wastes time} Nbd7 7. b4 {an unnecessary pawn move that wastes time and also creates tactical opportunites for Black's dark-square bishop} Re8 8. Bb2 e5 9. dxe5 dxe5 10. e4 {prevents the pawn fork, but now the light-square bishop is "bad"} a5 11. a3 axb4 12. axb4 Rxa1 {The rook exchange benefits black, who is ahead in development.} 13. Bxa1 b6 14. Qc2 Bb7 15. O-O Qa8 {forks the bishop and e4-pawn} 16. Nbd2 {discovered defense saves White's ass} Nh5 17. g3 {now h3 is weak} Qc8 18. Kg2 Bh6 {The bishop moves to a better diagonal.} 19. Bc3 f6 {supports the e5 pawn, but opens up the a2-g8 diagonal for White's bishop} 20. Ra1 {The a-file is of no use to anyone. All the action is on the kingside, where both kings are located.} Nf8 21. Nb3 Bc6 22. c5 Bd7 23. Ng1 Kh8 {saves a tempo, in case of Bc4+} 24. f4 {White blunders} exf4 25. g4 {this allows the bishop sacrifice (not 25. ... Ng7? 26.

Ke1 Nxc3+ {The discovered check wins more material.} 36. Kd2 Nge4+ 37. Bxe4 Nxe4+ 38. Kc1 Qf1+ {White's king is getting cornered on the opposite side of the board.} 39. Kc2 Qc4+ 40. Kb1 Rd8 41. cxb6 {White has 5 out of 6 pieces on the b-file and is in zugzwang.} Nc3+ 42. Qxc3 Qxc3 43. bxc7 Qxb3+ 44. Kc1 Rd1# {putting White in his grave}
