1. e4 {This game is included because of a possibility which came up. What I want you to do is to play through this and tell me what you would have done if White had played a differently on move 14.} c5 {My usual Sicilian} 2. d3 {This is not too bad, although not very common, as it is not very aggressive.} Nc6 3. Na3 {And this is bad, developing the knight to a bad square. The knight belongs on c3 or d2 where it has move influence on the centre.} d5 {I would not normally play this, as normally Black can just exchange pawns and play Nc3, but with the knight on a3 this is good.} 4. f3 {I don't like this move either, Bd2 perhaps is better? } e5 {Black now has a strong centre.} 5. exd5 {This is inconsistent with the previous move.} Qxd5 6. Nb5 {A good move, threatening Nc7 check.} Qd8 7. f4 a6 8. Na3 {The knight should drop back to c3} Bd6 9. Ne2 Bg4 10. Nc4 Bc7 11. fxe5 Nxe5 12. Ne3 Bh5 {White is going to find it hard to castle and complete development. } 13. Rb1 Ba5+ {Now what would you do if Bd2? I wonder who will be the first to answer correctly, in a message to me please.} 14. c3 {After this it becomes a massacre. } Nxd3+ 15. Kd2 Nf2+ 16. Ke1 Nxd1 17. Nxd1 Qd3 18. Nf2 Qxb1 {}
