[Opening "Queen's gambit accepted (D20)"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Accept gambit pawn or not, against a stronger player?  Accept to resist a blocked position.} dxc4 3. e3 {Defend pawn curious about the white side of things?  No. develop some minor pieces.} Nf6 4. Bxc4 e6 {Thar she goes. Let the bsb out for early castling.} 5. Nf3 {At this point GKDB does not give black a win, and off-book looks even more dangerous. Life in the suburbs? (pushed to either or both flanks)} a6 {a6 is sometimes called a 'waiting' move, but it makes sense to a weaker player, and the knight is not supposed to post on a or h files without a good reason.} 6. O-O Nbd7 {I do not fancy aggressive pawn movements like b5 - defensive development seems best.  } 7. a4 b6 {Forward a and h pawns bode ill in an even endgame - this is my feeling, and i invite judgement on this because i just don't know.} 8. Qe2 Bb7 {a3 is pressured and pushes the bishop to remain at hand. But the white knight on f3 will need to have support, or move if an exchange here would expose the king.} 9. Rd1 {the f rook is central, on my queens file, and supporting the d pawn - already strong.} c5 {trying to avoid an isolated c pawn. d5 is covered 3 to 2 in my favour, but the file is scary because of the rook. } 10. Nc3 Be7 11. e4 {d5 is one hot square.} O-O 12. Bg5 cxd4 {I am uneasy behind these e and pawns, perhaps a more open centre allows exchanges that makes analysis simpler against a stronger player.} 13. Nxd4 Nxe4 14. Nxe4 Bxg5 {Ooops!  There goes my knight...} 15. Nxe6 fxe6 16. Bxe6+ Kh8 17. Rxd7 Qc8 18. Nxg5 Qc6 {Janet's far too busy to notice the mate threat....}
