I seriously considered resigning here, but I remembered the comment that people learn the most when they play defensively, so I decided to stick it out and see if I can at least learn better defense.} 11. O-O Nxd1 {Ouch!} 12. Rxd1 {Now I am down 6 points and fear I will never make it up.} Bf6 13. Bb2 Re8 14. Rde1 Nd4 15. Nxd4 exd4 16. Nc4 Be6 17. Nd2 Qd6 18. Bf3 c6 19. Rab1 g5 20. Nb3 g4 21. Be2 f4 22. Nc5 Bc8 23. f3 b6 24. Ne4 Qf8 25. fxg4 Qg7 26. h3 h5 27. gxh5 Bxh3 {I considered moving the bishop on e2 up to f3 to protect the g2 pawn, but then I saw a better moves.} 28. Nxf6+ {Put the king in check. If the queen takes the knight, I get the bishop on g3. If the queen does not take the knight, but moves the king instead, then black can still threaten mate on the next move.} Qxf6 29. gxh3 {Now I am only down 2 points instead of 6.} Kh7 30. Bg4 Rxe1+ 31. Rxe1 Kg7 32. Re4 {Move rook into place for the next move.} f3 33. Bxd4 {Here is where I turn the game around. I pinned the queen against her king.} Qxd4+ 34. Rxd4 {And black gave up.}
