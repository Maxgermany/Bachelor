1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nbd2 Bd6 5. Ne5 O-O 6. e3 c5 7. c3 {I know, you'll say that c4 was better... but this is just the way I play.} c4 8. g4 Nbd7 {This move allows the tricky Nxf7. Black has to retake, the Q is threatened, and then BxBd6, winning a pawn. BUT it opens the f column for his R, and I am not sure I have a winning attack after that. So...} 9. g5 Ne8 {Now the Nxf7 threat is no more. } 10. h4 {Solidifying my pawn. He should play f6 now, I will have to go Ng4, then hold e5... no I have no real edge.} Bxe5 11. dxe5 g6 {It makes my work a little more difficult. Anyway...} 12. h5 Kg7 {The plain hxg6 is answered with fxg6, and I have nothing really. I have to build some more. } 13. Bh3 {? I threat now hxg6 and if fxg6, Bxe6. But this is a mistake, since it gives him a very nice counterplay. } Rh8 {Nc5, threatening the annoying Nd3+. He prefers to help the h column, but this gives me a tempo. } 14. hxg6 fxg6 {hxg6 would have been better, IMO, since after it I couldn't have swapped the e6 pawn. It was poisoned, nevertheless!} 15. Bxe6 Nc5 {Yesssss. The only good move for black. Now, I don't have any choice but to hold the countergame. I thought about Nxc4, avoiding the check, but black could have gone for NxB, and my piece sac won't give me anything solid (16. Nxc4, NxB or BxB, my N has to move, and 17. Nd6 just allows NxN, exN. After this move, thoug, I have Ne5 as a nice threat. Still, I wasn't sure about all this during the game. )} 16. Bxc8 Nd3+ 17. Ke2 Qxc8 18. Qg1 {Preventing Qg4+, followed by NxB, exN, Qxf4, and I'm almost lost. } Qf5 {I expected NxB here. He is planning Nxb2, then get the Q to d3 with check. The point is: can I afford that, or there is a tactic that kills me? I bet there was none. } 19. Qh2 Nxb2 20. Qh6+ Kg8 21. Nf3 {This may be a losing move, but let's see if and how he takes advantage of it.} Qd3+ 22. Ke1 Qxc3+ 23. Kf1 Qd3+ 24. Kg2 Qe4 {Pinning my N is a mild downside for such a terrible incursion. Now, his best chance were the c and d pawns, and I think that aftr d4 I am in very serious trouble. } 25. e6 {Finally getting the e5 square for my B!} Nd3 {Wise! Now he shields e5. I can't afford to lose my lsb and a pawn. } 26. Bg3 {Necessary!} Qxe6 27. Rab1 {? A bad one. He can defend too easily. Of course, he can't allow Rxb7!} b6 28. Rbd1 {Well... let's see now what happens. I telegraphed my idea, but there is few he can do about that!} Nd6 {Even better! This move leaves the black diagonal to h8 free after...} 29. Rxd3 cxd3 30. Be5 {...and black is a walking dead. Not even QxB can save him, since after NxQ, I threat Nxg6.} Qe7 {As I said in a recent game: all the fuzz (and -4) for an exchange? No way! :-)} 31. Bf6 {Mostly, making room for my N!} Qf7 {Too easy!} 32. Ne5 Qf8 {A tactic puzzle here (very easy). A single move makes me win. All the others gives advantage to black, even with the lost exchange on h8 and a messy position. "I'll give you two seconds... if you found it, congratulations!" :-)} 33. Qxg6+ {In great style, for a low rated player like me! } hxg6 {Qb7, QxQ#} 34. Rxh8# {Being -7, with only three pieces, all of them necessary for the mate. This was elegant, wasn't it? Please forgive me my self-praising, sometimes you just need it! Thank you for reading!}
