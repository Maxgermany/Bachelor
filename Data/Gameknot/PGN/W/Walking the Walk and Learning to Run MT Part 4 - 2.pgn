1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 {gambit accepted} 3. Nf3 {I usually play c3 for a danish gambit.} Nc6 {Joanne opts to defend her advanced pawn.} 4. Nxd4 {... which white takes} Bc5 5. Be3 {defending the knight} Qf6 {Glenda is on tour} 6. c3 Nge7 {White occupates the center but there is a big amount of black pressure on it.} 7. Bc4 {The most aggressive move.} b6 {To prepare a fiancheto} 8. O-O {King in safe} Bb7 {Black can castle on both sides} 9. Nb5 {Menacing fork attack by 10. Bc7} O-O-O {I was sure that black wouldn't dare to castle long with the many white pieces aiming at this side.} 10. Bxc5 {To prevent 10. ... Bxe3 11. fxe3 with double isolated pawns for white and to weaken black's king} bxc5 {weakening the king.} 11. Nd2 {Only place for the knight} a6 {threatening the knight} 12. Na3 {Not a very good place for a knight but there was no choice.} Ne5 13. Be2 {I hesitated a long time before electing this move. The other candidates moves where 13. Qe2 13. Qb3 13. Nb3 but black would probably have traded his e kight against the bishop and, in this particular position, I thought that the LSB would be usefull to attack the black queen, so that it shouldn't be traded.} d5 {Black plays very agressively. I first looked for a defensive move and felt very annoyed :  if 14. exd4 Rxd4 If 14. Qa4 d4. Finally I remember that "la meilleure défense c'est l'attaque"...} 14. f4 {... It weakens the king but black has no DSB anylonger, so that I considered it as no to dangerous for me. The plan is to develop, chasing the black queen so that black cannot regain the initiative for long. I remembered that  Joanne had trapped Dame Genievre one game ago, and thought it was nothing but justice to hunt her lady. Go, dog ! go !} Ne5g6 {The servant knight has to flee} 15. e5 {Black has little available moves for g5, and d5 are Under white's control f5 and f6 lose the queen by 16 g4. h4 is not safe. Black has 15. ... Qb6 or 15. ... Qc6 or can take with the knight, losing some material but opening white's center. another candidate move was 15. f5 but I didn't see how to carry on after. So "go dog ! go"} Qb6 {That (in my opinion at least) was the best square for black to go and I was not to happy about this move. but I was ready for it.} 16. Qc2 {white sends a powerfull defender.} f6 {Black counterattacks on the kingside.} 17. c4 {Long hesitation before playing this move because I have to sacrify the e pawn but white's plan is still to chase the queen.} fxe5 {Strenghtening black center and taking material advantage} 18. cxd5 {Both pawn structures are bad but the black one is even worse.} Nxf4 19. Bg4+ {escaping the danger} Kb8 {Only move} 20. Ndc4 {fork attack between queen and e pawn.} Qb4 {Good move from black. White has now little attacking possibilities and black can quickly be very dangerous with 21. ... Nxd5 22. ... Nxe5 or 21. ... Bxd5 menacing 22. ... Bxg2 etc.} 21. Qc3 {After a long hesitation, I opt for this move. Black is forced to take. The main advantage is to create an open file in b. Without queen and with knights in this position, black will have trouble to defend b7. The white king, in contrary, is in safety because black has no more pièces to menace the black diagonal a7g1. Of course, this move has the drawback to isolate the a  white pawn.} Qxc3 {Forced move.} 22. bxc3 {The b file is opened and it will, further in the game, be the main theater of operations.} Nfg6 {protecting e5} 23. Rab1 {pinning the LSB} Ka8 {Unpinning the LSB. White has strong attacking possibilities toward the king.} 24. Ne3 {Black is one pawn less. The situation is very opened with bad pawn structures on both sides, White controls the 2 open lines, although, in both lines, black limitates the possibilities of move of the rooks with her pawns or knight, the black king is weaker than the white one (poor Henry !), the center is contested. I saw no way to directly attack the king.} Rhf8 {I was surprised because it was none of the answers I imagined. As such a situation favorises the tactics and Joanne is rated far higher than me, I felt very unsafe. I saw 4 candidate moves : Rxf8 which my able opponent had surely taken into account, c4 which secured and blocked the center, probably leading to a draw, Bf3 which achieves little and Nac4 preparing an attack upon the king. It seemed the best move to cary on fighting for the victory.} 25. Rxf8 {I finally choose Rf8 to prepare the following attack, eliminating one defenseur on the 8 line to prepare 26. Nac8} Rxf8 {Now black controls one of the open files} 26. Nac4 {The other candidate move was c4 but it blocked the situation, the knight on c 4 menaces b6 and e5, it seemed to be better to conduct an attack.} e4 {Joanne could have counterattacked by Nxd5 or Bxd5 but she chooses to defend, preventing Bf3} 27. d6 {So that white must find another way to attack.} cxd6 {Almost  forced (the e knight had no proper place to go and the passed pawn would have been dangerous).} 28. Nxd6 {Trading a pawn and attacking the bishop} Rb8 {Doubtfull move, 28. ... Bc6 might have been better but I'm not sure (this I wrote during the game but finally it proved efficient.} 29. Nec4 {All white forces are aiming at the black king and at this moment, I tought that I had a winning game.} Ka7 {Good move.} 30. Nb6 {To menace 31. Nd7 with menace on the black rook but 30. Na5 would probably have been better, menacing the LSB. } Ne5 {counterattacking} 31. Nd7 {I couldn't find any other move, so that I initiated a trading sequence. I thought we were heading to a draw but black is one pawn ahead and has one passed pawn.} Nxd7 {trading} 32. Bxd7 {Horse trading} Bd5 {White has little choice.} 33. Rxb8 {Trading the rooks} Kxb8 34. Bf5 {Now white must be very carefull to obtain a draw. With a passed pawn (and the white a2 pawn under direct menace, white plays for a win).} Nxf5 {Black must think that the less, the merrier in an endgame with one pawn more} 35. Nxf5 {No choice} g6 36. Ne3 {At least, that one is blocked. White's plan is to block the a file with the lonesome rider and to take the e pawn with the king.} Bxa2 {2 pawns ahead but I still had hope to block all the black pieces.} 37. Kf2 {To come in e3 and take the pawn.} Bb3 {To block the lonesome rider's advance. During a time, I thought the situation was desperate.} 38. Nf1 {The survivor will go to a1 in time.} a5 39. Nd2 {Going for a ride.} Bc2 40. Nc4 {Avoiding the indian's ambushes on the way} a4 41. Na3 {Good place to be. White has to block all the pawns and all the passages that Henri may use... Done for the a, b,c and d file. Now, let's organise the right side.} Bd3 {Black blocks the lonesome rider and protect the e pawn.} 42. Ke3 {"No passaran"} Kc7 {"Beware, everybody", King Henri is coming.  just hope I didn't miss anything.} 43. g3 {The black king can come on that way. It's impossible to fully block this side but I estimated that there was still a chance for white.} Kd6 44. Kf4 {"You Shall not pass"} g5+ {Tempting but if 45. Kxg5 e3 and Glenda reappears on the board 2 moves later.} 45. Ke3 h5 46. Kf2 {No choice} h4 47. Ke3 {To defend the pass} Ke5 48. Kf2 {No choice} Kf5 49. h3 {to prevent 49. Kg4} g4 50. hxg4+ Kxg4 51. gxh4 Kxh4 52. Kg2 {Now white situation is desperate but I still want to try something.} Kg4 53. Kf2 Kf4 54. Ke1 {The place to be for the very last chance.} e3 55. Kd1 e2+ 56. Ke1 {Blocking the pawn} Kf3 57. c4 Ke3 {Of course black doesn't take} 58. Nb1 {last trap.} Bxc4 {Joanne is too wise and clever to fall into such a trap (if 58. ... Bxb1 stalemate)} 59. Nc3 a3 60. Nxe2 {If black takes, stalemate} a2 61. Nc1 a1=Q {White submits here. Well done Joanne and thanks for an interesting game.}
