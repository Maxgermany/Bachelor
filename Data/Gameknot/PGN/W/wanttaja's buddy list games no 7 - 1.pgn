[Opening "King's Indian (E71), Makagonov system (5.h3)"]

1. d4 {This game deals with the exchange sacrifice - one of the most difficult and challenging aspects of modern chess. Most commonly it involves an exchange of a Rook for a Bishop or a Knight - either for a direct attack or for positional reasons.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {The Kings Indian is still one of the best choices for Black, if he wants a dynamic game with good attacking possibilities on the King-side.} 5. h3 {A very rare line indeed! The move is more flexible than it looks. First of all, it takes away a lot of squares from Black´s c8-Bishop. In case of a White Bishop-move to e3, it can´t be attacked by a Black Knight-move to g4 - and if White should decide to castle long, he has the move g4 in hand with an attack on the Black King.} O-O 6. Nf3 a6 {I don´t think this is Black´s best option. Attacking the centre with Pawn-moves like c5 or e5 seems more active.} 7. Be3 Re8 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. a3 {A bit of a "luxury"-move, but Nb4 by Black could be annoying.} e5 10. d5 Ne7 11. Qd2 c5 {Closing the centre, but also creating long-term problems when it comes to activating the Bishop on g7. White´s Bishop on d3 is not much worth either at the moment, but it gets new life when play moves to one of the flanks.} 12. O-O Bd7 13. b4 b6 14. Rab1 Qc8 15. bxc5 bxc5 16. Rb6 {This leads to the exchange sacrifice, and I must admit, that I had no idea if it would do the trick or not. Many of these sac.´s are played more by "gut feeling" than long calculations.} Qc7 17. Rfb1 Bb5 {A very nice move, challenging the sacrifice.} 18. Rxd6 Qxd6 19. cxb5 Nd7 {!? After 19. - axb5 20. Nxb5, White has plenty of play against the Pawns on c5 and e5 plus a potentially dangerous passed Pawn on d5. My feeling was that White had more than sufficient compensation for the exchange, but absolutely nothing is clear yet!} 20. bxa6 Reb8 21. Rb7 Rxb7 22. axb7 {The Pawn on b7 will tie down Black´s pieces for a while and give time for re-grouping. Now 22. - Rxa3 could be answered by 23. Qb2 with a double-threat of Nb5 or promoting the Pawn.} Rb8 23. Qb2 f5 {Black desperately needs to find some counterplay, or White´s two Queenside Pawns will decide the game.} 24. Qb3 Kh8 25. Ng5 {Threats the nasty fork 26. Nf7 } Qb6 26. Qxb6 Nxb6 27. Ba6 Nd7 28. Ne6 {Even with the Queens off, Black is still under a lot of pressure, and his pieces are not well co-ordinated. Now another Pawn has to go.} f4 29. Bxc5 Bf6 30. Bd6 Rg8 {In this kind of position it becomes clear why a Rook can be a terrible defender.} 31. Na4 g5 32. Nac5 {White takes final control over the promotion-square b8, which will cost Black at least a piece. Therefore Black chose to resign. I hope this game will inspire you to look more for the option of the exchange sacrifice. If it works, it is a great weapon!}
