1. d4 {im playing with black} e5 2. dxe5 d6 {i do something called the englund gambit but my variation couldn't be foun in the gameknot openings section sadly} 3. Nf3 Bf5 4. exd6 {boring moves of development} Bxd6 5. e3 a6 6. Bd2 Nc6 7. Be2 Bb4 8. O-O Nf6 9. c3 Bd6 10. Nd4 Nxd4 11. exd4 h5 12. Bf3 {tries to threaten my pawn on b7} c6 {not only does this move block the bishop but it also lets me develop my queen to c7} 13. Re1+ Kd7 {i move my king so that i don't have to block and get that piece pinned for a while} 14. Bg5 Bxh2+ {sacrifice} 15. Kxh2 Ng4+ {this is a very good move because if he takes, i get a free move and its somewhat a discovered aattck} 16. Bxg4 hxg4+ {i check again to open up an entire file for my rook for free} 17. Kg1 Qxg5 {getting material back} 18. Qb3 Qh4 {i think i can take a hit or two all my good pieces are linked up and i think its somewhat a deadmate because kf1, bd3+, re2, qh1#} 19. Qxb7+ {instead he takes} Kd6 20. Qb4+ Kd7 21. Qb7+ Kd6 22. Qb3 {biggest blunder ever} Qh1# {i beat him because he was deadmated and its also because of the blunder he made ,though he put up a great fight . feel free to give me tips on my next annotation and comment}
