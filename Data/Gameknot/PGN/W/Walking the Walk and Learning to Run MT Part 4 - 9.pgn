Nxb7 {this move is seen by the computer as a blunder however I don't think it was by moving the queen it allows mate in 2 rather than the suggested 8.  if the queen does not attack the knight I can still move the knight to a5 to apply further pressure for black to move the queen} Qxb7 {the trap is set} 27. Re8+ {rook attacks e8 and also opens up the bishops line of fire on d4} Rxe8 {QxRe8#} 28. Qxe8# {}
