1. d4 d5 2. c4 {The queen's gambit. I'm trying to learn it better so I figure playing it against someone this good will help spot my mistakes with it.} e5 {Uh,oh I've never seen this before, hope I don't blunder the game too quickly.} 3. e3 {I I felt like capturing his pawn fell too easily into his plans.} exd4 4. exd4 Bb4+ 5. Nc3 Nf6 {So far, nothing special and I don't think there's advantage to either side.} 6. Qc2 {?! I think this might have been a bit of a mistake, I do this a lot in the queen's gambit because I like to move my rook underneath my queen and also this prevents doubled pawns if he captures my knight. But on the other hand, it is too early for the queen.} O-O {Nothing special so far, but I better castle soon or I might be in some trouble.} 7. Bg5 dxc4 {! This is a good move as it wins a pawn, at first I thought it was bad as it trades a center pawn for a side pawn that allows my to develop my LSB with the recapture.} 8. a3 Re8+ 9. Be3 {?! Better would have been to develop and block at the same time.} Bxc3+ 10. Qxc3 Nd5 11. Qxc4 Nxe3 12. fxe3 Rxe3+ {I'm not sure how this happened, as I suddenly went from a fine position to a terrible one.} 13. Be2 Be6 14. Qc1 {Somehow, without me realizing it actually happening, I've been confined completely to passivity.} Qxd4 {And I'm down by two pawns.} 15. Qxc7 Nc6 {At least I'm only down a pawn, but there are a few worrying possibilities with that pinned bishop.} 16. Rd1 {Trying to relieve my position somewhat, I see Qxb2, but I don't see anything better than what I played.} Qh4+ {This is a bad sign that he didn't take the pawn, this means he spotted something.} 17. g3 {Owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, This allows him to trap my rook.} Qe4 18. Qxb7 {I can't see anything else to do, anything I think about allows him in.} Re8 19. Kd2 {I'm trying to evacuate my king to avoid an immediate mate.} Bb3 {ouch, I didn't see this during my analysis, but it's painfully good. The only way out of checkmate within a move or so is to lose my queen for his bishop.} 20. Qxb3 {He'll take my queen next move, unless he spots something better, but at least I avoided immediate mate.} Rxb3 21. Kc1 {I continue my attempt to escape from danger.} Nd4 {He's coming in for the kill, his threats force me back where I was trying to escape from} 22. Kd2 Qc2+ {He has a forced mate in two. I made a puzzle out of it, so I resigned on grounds of Unavoidable Mate.} 23. Ke1 {}
