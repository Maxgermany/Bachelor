1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Qe2 b5 7. Bb3 O-O {The starting position for all the games.} 8. c3 d5 9. d3 dxe4 10. dxe4 Bg4 11. h3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 b4 13. Bd2 a5 14. Rd1 h6 15. a3 bxc3 16. Bxc3 Qc8 17. Nd2 {It took a while, but development is finally complete and the game starts taking shape.} a4 18. Ba2 Bd6 19. Kh1 Ne7 20. Nc4 {After some maneuvering, I threaten to exchange off Black's remaining Bishop, which would leave me with the much better pair of minor pieces.} Ng6 21. Nxd6 cxd6 22. Rxd6 {I gain a Pawn in the mix-up} Ra6 23. Rxa6 {Up a pawn and with 2 B's vs. 2 Knights on an open board, I'm definitely not averse to exchanging major pieces.} Qxa6 24. Rd1 Qb5 25. Bd5 Nxd5 26. Rxd5 {I sacrifice a minor exchange with the intent of winning a second Pawn [Black's KP].} Qf1+ 27. Kh2 Nf4 28. Bxe5 Nxd5 29. exd5 {In the confusion, I overlook that Black can win the Exchange. Now material is even, but my passed QP gives me an advantage.} Qb5 30. Qg4 {Buying time by threatening mate.} f6 31. Bd6 {Keeping the initiative by attacking the Rook.} Rd8 32. Qe6+ {Now I've finally guarded my passed Pawn, and still maintain the initiative with a check.} Kh8 33. Qf7 {Trying to set up a mate on the cornered King.} Qxb2 34. Bf8 {I willingly give up the QNP to threaten mate in 1. Black's Q is now forced to defend his KN2, restricting its movements severely.} f5 35. d6 {In the meantime, with the Q tied down, I press my passed Pawn menacingly forward.} Qd4 36. Qe7 {Black could rid himself of the menacing Pawn with 36... RxP 37 QxR, but I would have a technically easy win with my piece ahead.} Ra8 37. d7 {Pressing forward.} Kg8 38. Qe8 {If Black tries 38... Q-Q4 guarding the R and keeping the Queening square doubly guarded, I force his hand with 39 B-K7 dis ch.} Rxe8 39. dxe8=Q {Not only do I win the Rook, I also threaten to win at once with 40 B-B5 dis ch simultaneously attacking the Q.} Qc4 40. Bb4+ {I secure my B and QRP while maintaining the initiative.} Kh7 41. Qxa4 {Now I have yet another passed Pawn.} Qf4+ 42. g3 {Black is still fighting...} Qxf2+ 43. Kh1 {With my King in the corner, I have to be careful. At a minimum Black is seeking a perpetual check for a draw, and with the Q's still on the board, it's certainly possible.} Qxg3 44. Qd7 {I'm looking to regenerate my mating threat on KN7.} Qxh3+ 45. Kg1 {Black has succeeded in eradicating my K-side Pawns.} h5 46. Bf8 {The mating threat again restricts the movement of the Black Q.} Qg4+ 47. Kh2 {As good a spot as any.} h4 48. a4 {I can advance the Pawn freely since Black's Q is tied to defending KN2.} Qg3+ 49. Kh1 {Forced.} h3 50. Qb7 {Now *Black* has a mating threat at *my* KN2. Dueling potential mates...} f4 51. a5 {We both push on our Pawns.} f3 52. Qxg7+ {I'm forced to do this, since the Black KBP has cut my Q's access to KN2 on the diagonal.} Qxg7 53. Bxg7 {Black misses a golden opportunity. 53... P-B7!!! wins at once, as I cannot stop the P from Queening. But he is blinded by greed.} Kxg7 54. Kg1 {Now my K is in position to capture either Black pawn if it advances, and Black's K is too far away to prevent to promotion of my QRP.} Kg6 55. a6 {Black rushes his K forward to try and force through a Pawn, but he's one tempo behind.} Kg5 56. a7 {Onward!} Kg4 57. a8=Q {If the Black K were already at KN6, he could check with a Pawn and at least have an opportunity to force one through. But...} Kg3 58. Qg8+ {Now as long as I continually harass the K, the Black Pawns cannot move.} Kh4 59. Qh7+ {I'm hoping to move the Q steadily forward and through a series of checks win the two Black Pawns.} Kg3 60. Qg6+ {I suddenly see something...} Kf4 61. Qf6+ {Black has to move his K away from the Pawns. Instead, he plays a natural-looking move, trying to keep both Pawns protected...} Kg3 62. Qg5# {...and stumbles into this beautiful epaulette mate!}
