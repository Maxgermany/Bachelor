1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Right now, I'm almost exclusively playing the Queen's Gambit as white.} e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. cxd5 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 Qxd5 {I'm not sure if this is what I'd play. It does get the queen out, and its' hard to chase, but I think taking with the pawn would have had more lasting benefits as it would control more center and allows his LSB to develop better.} 6. Nf3 a6 {?! I have to call this a wasted move. I take it he was worried about me moving my bishop to b5, but it wouldn't have been a major problem for him if I had, and he could have chased it easily then.} 7. Qc2 Nc6 8. e4 {I grab a big chunk of the center} Qd8 {?! I would have moved it to a5 maybe? Undeveloping the queen completely negates any advantage to not capturing with the pawn back on move 5.} 9. Be3 Nf6 10. Bd3 {I complete minor piece development and have a strong center and well developed pieces. I believe white is slightly better here.} b6 11. O-O Bb7 {He adds pressure to my e pawn which is only defended twice.} 12. Rab1 {I bag the half open file.} Qc8 13. Ng5 {?! doesn't really accomplish anything.} b5 {?! If he wanted to move there, he could have done it in one turn.} 14. e5 {I press forward, grabbing more space and adding support to the e pawn.} Nd5 15. Rfe1 {I didn't want him to mess up my pawn structure if he traded.} Nxe3 16. Rxe3 Qd8 {Attacking my knight.} 17. Rf3 {?? Blunder} Ne7 {Blunder, he misses the ability to take my knight, and blocks in the attack. This also allows my rook to capture the pawn on f7. It's tempting to use the knight, but I have to use the rook because the LSB is attacking it.} 18. Rxf7 g6 19. f4 c6 20. Qb3 {I eye the e pawn.} Bc8 21. Rf6 Qd5 22. Be4 Qxb3 23. axb3 h6 24. Nxe6 {Gobble gobble gobble} Bxe6 25. Rxe6 {Look at white's position! his rook is dominant, he has a strong center and an excellent bishop.} Kf7 26. Rf6+ Kg8 27. Bxc6 Rc8 28. d5 {I advance my pawns. They sure look imposing.} Kg7 29. c4 Rhf8 30. Rxf8 Kxf8 {I'm ahead, so I don't mind trades.} 31. cxb5 axb5 32. Bxb5 Nxd5 33. g3 {Well, it's the endgame now, and white has a significant advantage.} Nc3 {Looks like it wins the bishop, but it doesn't.} 34. Rc1 {The knight is pinned, it can't take the bishop or I'll take the rook. I did notice that the knight could fork my king and rook, but I couldn't do anything about it.} Ne2+ 35. Bxe2 Rxc1+ 36. Kf2 {So now we come to an interesting position. I believe white has a slight advantage.} Rc2 37. b4 Rb2 38. b5 {I advance the pawn so that it is defended by my bishop.} Kf7 39. Ke3 {We both decide to get our kings involved.} Ke6 40. h4 Rb3+ {?! Doesn't accomplish much.} 41. Bd3 {I threaten his pawn. My bishop is pinned, so it can't take it, but if I move my king or he moves his rook...} g5 42. hxg5 hxg5 43. Ke4 {I could have recaptured, but I think that would have been inferior. Why? because it would have left me with two doubled pawns, and an isolated pawn.} gxf4 44. gxf4 {Instead I have an isolated pawn and two connected pawns.} Rb2 45. f5+ Ke7 {Black is now fighting for a draw.} 46. f6+ Kf7 47. Bc4+ Kf8 48. e6 {The BK is pushed backwards.} Rh2 49. e7+ Ke8 50. Be6 {?? Fatal mistake that allowed the draw.} Re2+ 51. Kd5 Rxe6 {!!!!!! If I recapture, he's stalemated. I really don't fancy my chances of playing three pawns against rook, so I decide to take the draw.} 52. Kxe6 {Well, he certainly fought back, and it was a fun game. Please comment and rate.}
