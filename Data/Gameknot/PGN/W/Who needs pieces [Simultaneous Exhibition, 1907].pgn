1. d4 {The amateur opens with the QP, hoping to prolong his resistance by playing a positional, slow game.} d5 {Bruening counters in Classical style.} 2. c4 {The standard reply.} e6 {Bruening plays an Orthodox defense in response.} 3. Bf4 {The amateur forgets the rule: Knights before Bishops. 3 N-QB3 is the move he should make.} c5 {Bruening takes advantage of this with an immediate challenge to the center.} 4. Nc3 {One move too late. Now Bruening can do...} cxd4 {...this in response.} 5. Bxb8 {The best move was to retreat the QN.} dxc3 {Now Bruening's advanced Pawn becomes threatening.} 6. Be5 {6 R-N1 or 6 PxP would drag out the game a bit.} cxb2 {Threatens PxR (Q) and B-N5 ch winning the White Q. White cannot defend both threats, so he resigns at once.}
