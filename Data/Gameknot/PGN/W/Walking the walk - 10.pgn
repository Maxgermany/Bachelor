1. d4 {Play d5, play d5} Nf6 {aww} 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Nimzo indian} 4. Bg5 {No clue what do do here, and since I don't think I learn anything if I follow the database I'm playing out on limb.} c5 5. d5 Nxd5 {Ohhhhhhh I somewhat unwisely take his queen.} 6. Bxd8 Nxc3 7. Qc2 {?? I really think this was a blunder. I think I should have taken his knight and let him win my queen back. Although then, while I might have lasted longer, I wouldn't have even put up as much fuss as I did.} Ne4+ {Expected} 8. Kd1 Nxf2+ {What else?} 9. Kc1 {Forced} Kxd8 {! No need to take the rook yet. I didn't think that he wouldn't take my rook immediately (I should have) and it totally threw off my calculations.} 10. a3 Ba5 11. b4 {I decide to play uber aggressive in the hope that I can get some counterplay. I can see that his wins a pawn, but it gives my rook an open file so maybe...} cxb4 12. axb4 Bxb4 13. Qb3 Bc5 14. Ra5 Bb6 15. Rg5 Nxh1 {He finally gobbles my rook} 16. Rxg7 {I looked at some various moves here, this seemed best.} Bxg1 {And yes, I did see that he could take my knight, but I'm just attacking all out, so I don't really care about that knight.} 17. Rxf7 Nc6 18. Qf3 {Threatening Qf6+} Bd4 {Deals with it} 19. Rf8+ {?? Never, ever, ever, trade one of your active pieces when you're way behind. My reasoning was something like this. Rf8+ Rxf8 Qxf8+ Kc7 Qf4+ forking his king and bishop, I then somehow assumed that he could do one of these three things. One: Kd8 where I could play Qf8+ and keep repeating it until he changed his move. Two: Kb6 I was then hoping that I could somehow get perpetual check or something, I didn't really analyze it. Or three, I though he could play Ne5, but for some reason I didn't notice Be5.} Rxf8 20. Qxf8+ Kc7 21. Qf4+ Be5 {! Totally sucks the remaining life out of me.} 22. Qe4 {I looked at all kings of super suicide sacs here, like throwing all my piece at him and hoping for a stalemate (ridiculous I know, but I wanted to fight to the end) but I decided to just lay over and die.} a5 23. g3 a4 24. Qxh1 {I know, this is useless, but I want to win some material back if I'm going to lose.} a3 25. Bg2 a2 26. Bf1 {Last ditch attempt to save my king. I expected a1=Q+ Kc2 Qxf1 and then I'd recapture and be 6 points down. Somehow, I didn't see the mate.} a1=Q+ 27. Kc2 Qc3+ {Oh well, I was lost anyway} 28. Kd1 Ra1# {Sigh, not a great game by me but it was impressive the way he ate me. Earlier I said my game against easy19 was like a wolf shredding a chicken. This game, was an elephant stomping on a beetle. All that's left of me is a smear on the ground.}
