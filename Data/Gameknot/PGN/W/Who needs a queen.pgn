1. e4 {The title of the game  "Who needs a queen" .  I was not sure who was going to lose a queen but I would soon find out.   White opened with Kings pawn to e4.} f5 {I decided to play using the Dutch defence.  I was intending to move my g knight out to f6.} 2. Qh5+ {White moved his queen down to check my king at h5.} g6 {I stopped the check by moving my g pawn to block the queen and protect my f pawn.} 3. Bd3 {White developed his LB out to d3.} gxh5 {I took the queen with my g pawn.  Now I found out who was going to lose their queen.  However this has given me doubled pawns on my h file which obviously means I cannot safely cast on the king side.  I don't think I would have chosen to take the queen in this position but if I get a chance to take a queen then I would mostly likely do so.} 4. exf5 Nf6 {Now white takes the pawn I was offering at the start which provides a place for my knight to reside and stops the pawns advance.} 5. Nf3 {White develops his knight to f3 and prepares to castle.} d6 {I move my pawn to d6 and this allows my LB to be pointed at white's pawn on f5 and stops f3 knight from moving onto e5.} 6. O-O {White castles.  White looks likely to move his rook onto the e file which only has my undeveloped e7 pawn and the king still on his spot.} c5 {I continue to add to my pawn chain with the move c5.  I wonder if e5 would have been a better move as it would stop white from using the e6 square to place his pieces and limit my scope for attack.} 7. Nc3 {White develops his b knight to c3.  White's bishop is looking happy with itself as it is currently at d3 and has access to 2 diagonals to a6 and h7. } Bxf5 {For some reason I now decide to capture the pawn at f5 and in consequence lose my LB to white.} 8. Bxf5 {White captures my LB.  Actually this may be fair in the circumstances since white gave me his queen its only fair I give him something back.  But there is nothing for the LB to attack so this may be returning to its previous good position but I suppose its here so it might as well stay and cause me difficulties in moving my pieces out.} Rg8 {I move my rook out to the half open g file as my doubled pawns are both protected by the knight at f6.} 9. d3 {White moves his d pawn to d3 to allow his DB access to the diagonal to h6.} Nc6 {I develop my b knight to c6 trying to get my pieces out on the queen side so I can long castle.} 10. Be6 {Now that pesky LB moves to the spot which I in future will try to fill with my own pieces before my opponent gets in them.  He is now pointed at my rook on g8.} Rg7 {So I bring my rook out to g7 as there is nothing for me to attack at present and white has some squares on the g file protected.} 11. h3 {White pushes the h pawn out to h3.  This stops my f knight from landing on g4 plus the e6 bishop is also protecting this square.} d5 {I push my d pawn out to d5 this is protected by f6 knight and the queen.  It is threatening to move up to d4 and attack the c3 knight.  The pawn also hems in the LB on e6 on one diagonal.} 12. Re1 {The white rook is moved across to e1 to take control of this file and protect the LB.  The king is still on his spot.} d4 {Now I push my d pawn and threaten to capture the d3 knight although I am in the reach of the f3 knight.  I have 2 protectors in the c5 pawn and the c6 knight.} 13. Ne2 {The knight retreats back to e2.  This was probably a good time for me to bring out my queen but I think I was worried about the LB at e6.} Nb4 {I decide to move my c3 knight into an area where it can cause a bit of concern to white.} 14. Bb3 {White's LB also decides to move to b3 to protect pawns that are in the firing line.  I see that was one way of removing the pesky LB.  I should now try to fill that hole.} Qd6 {I now bring my queen out to allow me to long castle.    My queen is protecting 4 pieces in the position she has come out to and has a diagonal which she can control.} 15. Nf4 {I should have taken that knight on f4 but I wanted to castle and get my king out of the way.  You know what will happen next.} O-O-O {I castle.  Great at last its done my king is safe well just peaking out a little bit.  I still have my DB blocked in at f8 so I need to move that pawn at e7 soon as I need to double up my rooks.} 16. Ne6 {Oh no now I have white's knight on the e6 square which I wanted to make sure my opponent could not use.  The knight is threatening to capture my rook or my LB but I am unable to take with my queen as the rook at e1 is waiting to pick up the queen.  The rook has the king and queen to protect it but the DB has no protection.} Nbd5 {So back comes my knight to d5 which was not really doing anything at b4 so now it is paired up with the knight at f6 and they can see off any attacks on either of them.} 17. Bg5 {White's DB is developed out to g5 and attacking my knight at f6 which is protected by the pawn at e7, queen at d6 and kngiht at d5.} Rg8 {I decide to move my rook back to g8 to allow my DB to be developed and as this is my only bishop I do not wish to trade it off with the DB lurking at g5.} 18. Nxd8 Qxd8 {Knight takes my rook and queen retakes the knight.  I am not sure I wanted my queen on the back row again but I did not want to take with my king as this would make him more exposed.} 19. Re5 {White moves his rook up to e5 and I have nothing to defend this move.  No doubt he will move his 'a' rook and double up his rooks on the e file.  I now see that without my queen at d6 this move was on the cards.  So I should have taken with my king instead.} Qc7 {I move my queen to c7 now threatening the rook which is protected by the knight.} 20. Rae1 {And as expected 'a' rook moves along to e1 and it looks like white is getting ready for a battle.  I thought I had a good defence on this file as I have a pawn at e7 which is protected by d5 knight and the queen and DB.  Maybe I was putting too much weight on my pawn's shoulders.} Rg7 {Now I also bring in my rook to g7 so now 4 defenders of this pawn as I saw it.  But of course this may not have been the object of white's threat.} 21. Bxd5 {And the LB slips in from b3 and takes my d5 knight.  One of my defenders gone.} Nxd5 {So I take the LB with my f knight.} 22. Rxd5 {Rook captures my knight at d5 now attacking the square next to my king d8 with the queen protecting this.  There is a pawn in front of my king at b5 which may be useful square to take.} Qb6 {I move my queen to b6 defending the pawn at c5 and the 6th file plus d8 square should the rook decide to take that square on but unlikely.  Apart from 1 pawn at h5 my pieces are all working together.} 23. Ree5 {Now the rook at e1 comes down to e5 and joins his pal on d5.   Nothing to defend this move with.} Rf7 {I now decide to move my rook to f7 protecting my bishop and still protecting the pawns on e7 and h7.  The rook was threatening the DB at g5 but this was protected by the f3 knight so I don't feel that moving the rook made a lot of difference here.} 24. Rdxc5+ {D rook moves to take pawn at c5 but I did not want to risk my queen as e5 rook would have taken and it would still have been check.  } Qc6 {I move my queen to prevent check to c6 protected by b7 pawn.} 25. Nxd4 {White's knight captures pawn at d4 and is now threatening queen at c6 who is unable to move because she is now pinned.} Kd7 {So king moves to d7 to unpin the queen and avoid getting stick at the back.  } 26. Nxc6 {Knight captures queen.} bxc6 {B7 pawn takes knight which cannot be taken as king is now protecting the pawn.} 27. Rca5 {C rook moves to a5 ready to take a7 pawn which will put king in check.} Kd6 {King moves up to d6 threatening to take d5 rook if a5 rook moves off 5th row.} 28. Bd2 {DB moves to d2 in order to access king from the queen side of the board as the e rook is blocking access to the king.} e6 {I move pawn to e6 leaving my rook to protect the a7 pawn if taken by a rook I will take back.} 29. Bb4+ {DB puts king in check and king will need to retreat back to 7th row which will mean my rook is redundant.} Kd7 30. Rxa7+ {So rook takes my a7 pawn and checks the king.} Ke8 {King retreats to e8 to take cover behind pawn at e5 and with bishop alongside at f8.} 31. Rxe6+ {E rook moves to e6 and takes pawn and checks king.} Be7 {I move DB up to e7 to stop check but white's 2nd rook is at a7.   Looks like trouble} 32. Bxe7 {And of course DB comes in to save day and pinches my DB but I will have revenge.} Rxe7 {I take DB with my f rook.  Now its just me and my rook against him and his 2 rooks.} 33. Rexe7+ {White captured my rook and checked me at e7.} Kf8 {I stepped out of check onto f8.} 34. Reb7 {E rook moved to b7 getting further away from the king so I didn't interfere with the play.} c5 35. Ra8# {My king was only able to move along the row so I moved my c pawn waiting for the inevitable checkmate.    (In this game I think I got to put up a bit of a fight compared to my last game with easy19 but I should have as I did have a queen and he didn't.    1) Try not to create an outpost for your opponent to put their pieces. 2) I think I missed a chance on move 15.  Instead of castling I should have moved my b knight to d5 ready to take on the knight and there would have been a bit of a fight.  The only thing is then my king would have been in the middle. )}
