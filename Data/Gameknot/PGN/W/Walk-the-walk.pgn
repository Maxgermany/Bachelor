1. c4 {My standard opening for many reasons.} Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. g3 Bc5 4. Bg2 Nc6 5. Nf3 d6 6. O-O h6 7. d3 a6 8. e3 O-O {Now that both sides have castled, white is a little behind due to the problem of the limited mobility of my bishops. This is a problem that usually comes up though and I feel as though it is not something that causes me to lose this game.} 9. a3 Ba7 10. b4 {With these two moves I take squares away from Black's bishop and knight. } Be6 11. Qb3 d5 12. cxd5 Nxd5 13. Qc2 Nxc3 14. Qxc3 Bd5 15. Bb2 Re8 16. Rfd1 Qf6 17. Ne1 {This was the beginning of my problems I think. I moved here without really having a definite plan for the knight.} Bxg2 18. Kxg2 Rad8 19. Qc4 b5 20. Qg4 Bb6 21. Rac1 Qd6 22. Nf3 Qd5 23. Qe4 Qxe4 24. dxe4 {This trade was probably ill advised, but at the time I saw nothing better.} f6 25. Nh4 Rxd1 26. Rxd1 Rd8 27. Rxd8+ Nxd8 28. f4 Nf7 29. Nf5 Kf8 30. Ba1 {Again, I saw nothing better, but moved this piece anyway.} c5 31. Bc3 {As white wastes time, Black is capturing more and more board space.} c4 32. Kf3 {Looking back, I probably should have played this at move 30.} g6 33. Nh4 Kg7 34. g4 Bc7 35. h3 Nd8 36. Ng2 Ne6 37. h4 g5 38. f5 Nd8 39. Ne1 {At the time, I made this move thinking of how I could try and recover some of my lost position. h5 was the better response.} gxh4 40. Kg2 Nf7 41. Kh3 Ng5+ 42. Kxh4 Nxe4 43. Bb2 Bb6 44. Nc2 c3 45. Ba1 Kh7 46. Kh3 h5 47. gxh5 Kh6 48. Kg2 {Kh4 was the better option. I even knew this at the time. Here I thought one thing and did another.} Kxh5 49. Kf3 Nd2+ 50. Ke2 Nb1 51. Kf3 Kg5 52. Ke4 Kg4 53. Ne1 Kg3 54. Kd3 Kf2 55. Nc2 e4+ 56. Kxe4 Ke2 57. Kd5 Kd2 {There is nothing more I can do to save the position. So I resign here.}
