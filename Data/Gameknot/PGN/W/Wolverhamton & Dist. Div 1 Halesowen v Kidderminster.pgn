1. e4 g6 2. Bc4 {We have played many times before so I had expected a Modern Defence} Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Nge2 {Keeping the option of a later f4} Nf6 5. d3 c5 6. O-O {beginning to transpose into a closed Sicilian} Nc6 7. Bb3 {kind of a waiting move but I prefer B on b3 so that I can recapture with axb3 if he decides to play Na5 and Nxb3} a6 8. f4 b5 9. Nd5 {need to make c3 square available in case he threatens to trap my Bishop.} e6 10. Nxf6+ Bxf6 11. c3 {making c2 available to preserve the Bishop, also to reduce the control he has on the a1 > h8 diagonal and maybe prepare for a later d4} Bd7 12. Be3 Bg7 13. Ng3 {with the idea of f5 should he Castle} Na5 14. Bc2 f5 15. Qe1 O-O 16. e5 {and if dxe5 then Bxc5} Qc7 17. exd6 Qxd6 18. Qf2 {adding to the pressure on his c Pawn} Rac8 19. Rad1 {preparing d4} Qe7 20. Ne2 {Knight no longer needed on g3 since my f5 idea is now not possible...} Rfe8 21. Rfe1 c4 22. Bd4 cxd3 23. Bxd3 Nc4 24. Bxg7 Qxg7 25. Bxc4 {maybe I could have played Nd4 but I think the endgame is better for me...} Rxc4 26. Rd6 {I preferred my position slightly here due to my control of the d file, his bad Bishop and his backward e Pawn. Also had the idea of Nd4, Nf3 and then fixing Knight permanently on e5} e5 {he had other ideas though, removing the weakness} 27. Red1 {seemed to make sense to grab control of d file and threaten Rxd7} Bc8 28. Rd6d8 Qe7 {My opponent offered a draw here, we both had about 6 minutes left on our clocks and 6 moves to meet the time control.  I decided to play on as I felt the threat of Qb6 was worth trying for..... } 29. Rxe8+ Qxe8 30. Qb6 {Threatening Rd8} Rc6 {a mistake, Kf7 is best... can you see why?} 31. Rd8 {.... winning material} Rxb6 32. Rxe8+ Kf7 33. Rxc8 exf4 34. Rc7+ Kf6 35. Nxf4 {Leaving me a piece up} Rd6 36. Kf2 {Maybe 35. Nd4 would have been better than Nxf4 as this would stop any counter-play down the d file.  But I still felt in control and had answers to the Rd2+ threat..... such as Rc6, picking up the a Pawn.} Rd2+ 37. Ne2 a5 {if Black plays Rxb2 here then White can play Rc6+ followed by Rxa6} 38. Ra7 a4 39. c4 {breaking up the Pawns} bxc4 40. Rxa4 Rxb2 41. Ra8 Ke5 42. Re8+ Kd5 43. Ke3 {Removing the pin to stop c3, also the trap... if Rxa2, then Nc3} Kc5 44. a4 Rb3+ 45. Kd2 {We adjourned in this position where my opponent playing Black made a sealed move. We had arranged a date to finish the game but after looking at the position when over the following days he decided to resign.  My Knight and King should be able to stop the c Pawn leaving my Rook to mop up the Kingside pawns.    H had sealed the move g5, which I could meet with Re5.  I expected Rb2+ but after Kc3, Black is clearly winning and if then Rb3 then Kc2 with Nc3 to follow.  Thanks for looking. }
