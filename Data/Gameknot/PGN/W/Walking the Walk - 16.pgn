[Opening "Bishop's opening (C23), Calabrese counter-gambit"]

1. e4 {This my first annotation, so let me know if I use the wrong name or terminology somewhere. I have been playing this opening for a year now and am getting comfortable with it} e5 2. Bc4 {I prefer Bc4 over Bd5 because black will want to play c6 sometime anyways. It does keep him from play Nc6 but it gives him opportunity to quickly put pressure on my king with Qa5} f5 {I think this is called a gambit of some kind. I could take blacks chance of castling by playing Bxg8 but after Rxg8 I either play exf5 and black get first jump at occupying center or I could play a knight forward, probably Nc3, and then have 2 pawns to contend with. I think white could take center but it wouldn't be as easy as it looks.  I could play Nc3 but if black would play f4 I'll be fighting these pawns for awhile.   Nf3 might not be a bad move. 3.Nf3 fxe4 4.Nxe5 would leave white looking pretty good right now.  Qh5+ would be an OK move also I think. Black kings side would be very open.} 3. exf5 {But what stick out gets taken. I think this is called gambit accepted.} Nf6 {black is taking control of center} 4. Ne2 {I think Nc3 would have been a better move. Ne2 is looking at d4 and f4 but it cuts off my bishops retreat.} d5 {I thinks this is a good move for black, it puts pressure on my bishop and the pawn is solidly backed up by the knight and queen} 5. Bd3 {I pulled back to defend f5 but I think Bb3 would have been a better move, keeping an eyeball on blacks back rank.} e4 {why not? he's reinforced by d5 and Nf6} 6. Bb5+ {what else could I do? If I had played 4.Nc3 instead of 4.N32 I'd have a few more options then I do now but nothing great even then. I could play Ba6 and black would have either double pawns or a knight on the A file. But blacks center pawns are on white, I want to keep my white bishop.} c6 {and the chase is on} 7. Ba4 Bxf5 {here we sitblack dominating the board, although he has opened his pawns up a bit. And white has a closed rank, with a lonley bishop out there (is this called a hung bishop?)} 8. h3 {this seems like a week move but I played it to put pressure on g4. I considered 8.Nf4 but didn't like the looks of 8...Bd6 9.d3 exd3 10. Nxd3. And I didn't like 8.Nd4 because of 8...Bg4. I think Nbc3 or 0-0 would have been better a better move. I would probably go with Nbc3 if I were to this position.} Bd6 {black is controlling more of center. Would Bc5 have been a better move?} 9. Nd4 {OK, i'm stepping into center. Threatening bishop on f5 and c6 is pinned.} Bd7 {c6 is no longer pinned. If black moves c5 I'm in trouble.} 10. Nc3 {a4 is supported and I'm putting pressure on center.} O-O {Black castles while he has the chance. Something I should have done also.} 11. d3 {I should have castled here but I didn't. This gives me a chance to see what kind of player I'm against. I know that he doesn't take a piece as soon as it's available, and if he plays e3, a very bad move in my opinion, I would try to exploit his weakness for passing pieces or always advancing.} exd3 12. Qxd3 {that played as i figured it would, with my queen now adding support to center and my queen and dark bishop cutting a nice diagonal. But now I have a glaring problem with my e file.} b5 {the start of the b, c and d pawns advance.} 13. Bb3 {My bishop is now where he should have been from move 5.} b4 14. Nce2 {I had been developing on the empty space on a, b and c file but I thinks it's time to move over to kings side and see if I can get my pawns to hold queen side.} c5 {I have to admire the way Ion worked these 3 pawns} 15. Nf3 {falling back but still putting pressure on center and moving toward the available space on king side} Be6 {I'm not sure why he moved here. I would think that a5 or Qe8 would have been better....but the white bishop on b3 is staring at blacks king.} 16. c4 {I have the advantage on the fight over c4 and if it goes to check, 16.c4 dxc4 17.Bxc4 Bxc3 18.Qxc4+, I will have a chance to castle.} bxc3 e.p. {I forgot about en-passent!!} 17. Qxc3 {I took with the queen because of my bishop/queen split and to keep my a,b pawns together} Ne4 {black is firmly entrenched in center now.} 18. Qe3 {c2 or e3, I'll take e3, again leaning towards kings side. Although the queen side has opened up more then I thought it would.} c4 {and here comes the c pawn again.} 19. Bc2 {again falling back while looking at the kings side. Would Ba4 have been a better move?....i don't think so. I do wonder how this would have played out though, 19.0-0 cxb3 20.axb3....I don't like the looks of the islands but my rook would have the a file to play on.} Bc5 {I keep finding myself in a position with subtle pressure applied. Something i need to remember to look for in my games} 20. Ned4 {The fight over center has begun. Ned4 protects my queen while putting pressure on e6, BUT I'll have to move my queen first.} Nc6 {and now my knight is threatened} 21. Bxe4 {The computer analysis says that Nxe6 would have been a better move but with my king out there and the force that black has out right now, I think it would have been a fine line to walk trying to protect my queen and king. } dxe4 22. Nxe6 {well, ok I will play Nxe6, I would have preferred to wait one more move. Also I would of rather Nc6 and creating an unbalance, but thought that I might end up losing my knight, so I'll threaten blacks queen and rook} Bxe3 23. Nxd8 {and there's the exchange.} Bxf2+ {there goes my chance of castling. } 24. Ke2 {And here was my mistake. The reason I didn't take the bishop was because I didn't like the looks of. 24.Kxf2 Nd4 25.Nd7 exf3 26.gxf3 Rxf3+ 27.Kg2 Raf8. I'm still not sure what the best move here is.} exf3+ 25. gxf3 Raxd8 26. Kxf2 {so now the pieces are taken. I should be concentrating on getting my rooks developed} Nd4 27. Bd2 {I don't know why I moved here. I think that f4 or Bg5 would have been better....or Rd1 that might have been best.} Rxf3+ 28. Kg2 {This is really the only move to make.} Rd6 29. Raf1 {I think Bc3 or Bb4 would have been better} Rg6+ 30. Kh2 Rfg3 31. Rf8+ {I'm seeing checkmate in a few moves, so I through a hail-mary, will he make a mistake somewhere?} Kxf8 32. Bb4+ {I think 32.Rf1+ Kg8 33. Bf4 would have been better.} Kg8 33. Rf1 {get the rook out of there, because of Nf3#} Nf3+ 34. Kh1 {the game is over so, I moved here thinking black would play Rxh3# but instead we went for one more move.} Rg3g1+ 35. Rxg1 Rxg1# {Ion also annotated the game but i haven't read through it yet, I wanted go through this on my own. I enjoyed the game and hope I can retain an apply what I've learned. thanks for playing.}
