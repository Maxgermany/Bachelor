1. e4 {The King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {The King's Pawn Game.} 2. Nf3 {Now, it transposes into the King's Knight Opening.  For me, this is standard, and I play it almost as often as the Open Sicilian Variation.} f5 {I originally thought that he would play 2...Nc6, so that I could transpose into the Ruy Lopez.  However, he drops a pawn, so I decide to take advantage by grabbing it.  Afterall, it is a free pawn, and it does not expose my King, at the moment.} 3. exf5 Bc5 {This is good because he is developing, but I would have played 3...Nf6, instead because it is said that you are supposed to develop your knight before the bishop.  However, General Opening Principle does not matter that much.  Afterall, GM tactical-abyss, and tigerlilov said that principles are only general guidelines to go by, but they do not always help you to win.  In some cases, you will win, if you do not always follow the guidelines.  In fact, that was one reason that I posted an annotation about, "Poor Opening Play", and stated that you sometimes have to play badly, in order to play well.  Of course, some people disagree with that assessment.  } 4. Nxe5 {?? I figured that I would take advantage by grabbing another pawn because he left it hanging.  However, I discovered that he deliberately gave it away, but why would he sac this pawn?  As it turns out, this is a deflective sacrifice that will eventually become a gambit.  Having said that, this is a very big mistake.  In fact, it is a loosing blunder because this will expose my King.  However, I am nowhere near ready to resign, yet. } Bxf2+ {In this position, my best move is 5.Kxf2, taking his DSB.  Afterall, I only have one other option, but it still exposes my King and takes away the opportunity to castle, given that I have to move the King.} 5. Kxf2 Qh4+ {Now, I am back in check, so I only have several options.  In this position, g3 is best, but it is better to move my King backward then forward.  However, I chose to move it forward, which exacerbates the King exposure. } 6. Kf3 Ne7 {Now, he is getting ready to continue develop and castle Kingside.} 7. g3 {Now, I decide to kick his Queen, but it is a little late for that because I am no longer in check.} Qd4 {In this position, I can only protect my Knight by moving my f Queen to the e file.  However, I do not do that because I was not completely concentrating, and I am only thinking about development which is another way for me to remember that General Opening Principles are only guidelines that do not always work.  As a result of my next move, he will win back a piece.} 8. Bc4 Qxe5 9. g4 {Now, I think about connecting my pawns, but the timing is off because this is not an endgame.} b5 {Now, he is clearly trying to win another piece, but I am not going to allow that.} 10. d4 {So, I decide to kick his Queen, for a second time.} Bb7+ {And, he decides to place me back in check, but this is a mere nuicanse because I will get out of it by moving my King back.  This is good, because I will reduce the exposure, that I had excaserbated, earlier.} 11. Kf2 Qe4 {I do not know why he played this because we know that he is not going to win the h1 Rook, do to my Queen.} 12. Rg1 {In this position, my intentions are to put pressure on the h-file because I can not castle, but it is a mistake because he is going to win another free piece, that I cannot get back.  Having said that, this is not gambit or a deflective sac, so 12.Bd3 was best as it kicks the Queen, again.} bxc4 13. Nc3 {Therefore, I will kick it with my Knight because I want to develop with an intention to connect my rooks.  Note: GM Kasparov was able to connect his rooks, despite not castling.  In fact, he decided not to castle, for that reason.} Qc6 14. Qe2 {And I decide to bring my Queen out, for the same reason, that I had mentioned on move 13.} O-O {Now, he takes advantage of his opportunities and decides to castle.} 15. d5 {Once again, I decide to kick his Queen, but best was 15.Qxe7, winning back a piece.  This will allow him to win a free pawn with the same Knight that I should have captured, and I do not like to give away material.  So far, I do not think that I am playing well, at all.} Nxd5 16. Qe5 {Now, I am trying to figure out a way to get something back, but it will not work.} Nb4 {He wants to win another free pawn, but I am not going to allow that.  Instead, I will protect it, with my final phase of development.} 17. Bg5 Qf3+ {Of course, I would have finished connecting my rooks, if it was feasible, but he is not going allow it.  Therefore, he decides to place me back in check, and it is serious because he is going to win another free pawn.  On the other hand, I will get out of it by alleviating the exposure even more, given that I am moving back to the first rank.  } 18. Ke1 Nxc2+ 19. Kd2 {In this position, it is unlikely that I will be able to win, so I try to trick him into a draw by repetition.  Note: my King was on d2 before I had played 18.Ke1.  However, he is going to see through it, and my attempt is not going to work.  } Qd3+ {This is why.  Instead of 19...Qf3+, he plays this.  Now, I am only interested in getting my King back to, "Square one" (the first rank.)} 20. Kc1 Nd4 {In this position, my only option is to sac my Queen for his d3 knight, or 21...Qc2#, mating me in one.  Therefore, I now know that the game is officially lost, for white.  However, I am not going to resign, until I am out of options because I am still learning.  As a couple of commentators have illustrated, you only stay in, when you have things to learn.  As it turns out, I am going to learn a lot more, so stay tuned.} 21. Qxd4 Qxd4 22. Rd1 {? At this point, I am going to kick his Queen because it has caused a lot of damage.  However, I was not thinking clearly, and this turns out to be another mistake because he is going to win my g4 pawn, for free.  BTW, that was the only pawn connected, so this also leaves my f5 pawn and DSB hanging.} Qxg4 23. Be7 {I decide to kick his f1 Rook, this time, to protect my DSB.  There is, however, one drawback.  In this position, he is going to place me in a check that I percieve as a nuicanse.  However, this is very serious.  Why?  } Qf4+ {This is the reason, and it is where I also learn even more.  Until now, I had no idea that he was threatening mate.  However, my opponent said that 23.Re7 was the only way to prevent mate.  That was he implied that 23.Be7??  There was some move that was a lot better then Be7, but I forgot what that was.  Bigpeta said that my last move got me into even more trouble.  Nonetheless, I am still not going to resign, yet.  As Jack Stockel would say, "It's not so easy", and, "Try to find a way out of trouble".} 24. Rd2 Re8 {?? He decides to kick my DSB, but that does not bother me because I will do that to his Queen, in return.  However, there is a drawback to Kicking his Queen.  What is it?} 25. Ne2 Qf1+ {That's the problem.  This is very bad because I either have to loose my other Knight, or the a1 Rook.  26.Rd1 is the only way to protect that Rook.} 26. Rd1 Qxf5 {As implied earlier, 26...Qxe2 was best.} 27. Nd4 {Now, I decide to take advantage by reattacking his Queen.  Afterall, I do not know what else to do because the game is still lost for white.  It goes by what Black-cat-hamelet, (previously know as x-machine), told me.  It only pays to play poorly when you are clearly loosing and do not think that you have a chance to pull a win or draw.} Qf4+ {And, he decides to place me back in check.  This time, however, I am going to get out of this with my d1 Rook, as opposed to the King because I do not want to expose it even worse then it already is.  On the other hand, this is serious because he is going to do, what he could have done several moves ago.  What is that?  Now, he is going to win my DSB, for free, after I get out of check.} 28. Rd2 Rxe7 29. Nb5 {?? Hoping for anything and seeing what I can get out of it, I decide to attack his c7 pawn.  I thought that he had no way of defending it, or his a8 Rook, in this position.  This way, I would be able to get something back, but I was completely wrong.} Re2 {This is why.  He is attacking my d2 Rook, and I cannot play 30.Rxe2, as it would be illegal.  Therefore, mate is inevitable and it is mate in two, even if 30.Nxc7.  Why?  30...Qxd2, 31.Qb1 (forced), 31...Re1#, so I resign.  Overall, I learned an important lesson about the Leftian Gambit.  It is a true gambit that often wins for black.  That was illustrated, in this particular game.}
