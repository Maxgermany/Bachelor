1. e4 {The King's Pawns Opening.} c5 {The, "cornerstone", of the Siclian Defense.} 2. Nc3 {This is not a blunder, but I am not crazy about this response.  According to Jack Stockel, 2.Nf3 is the proper way to respond to the Sicilian Defense, followed by 3.d4.  However, blake78613 mentioned that this move is perfectly playable, in response to 1...c5.} d6 {This is Mr. Stockel's favorite continuation of the Sicilian Defense.} 3. Nf3 {This is ok move, but I would have played it sooner, if I were white.} a6 {Once he decided to bring his other knight out, I was not hesitating to play this move.  If he played the Open Sicilian immediately, I would have advanced my a7 pawn, later in the game.  For Open Sicilian, 1.e4, c5 2.Nf6, d6 3.d4, cxd4 4.Nxd4, or 4.Qxd4? are played, followed by 4...a6.  That prevents your opponents knight or LSB from threatening the b file.} 4. d4 {At this point, he decides to play the Open Sicilian.  If I were white, I would have done the same thing, earlier in the game.   } cxd4 5. Qxd4 {? As I had mentioned earlier, this is a mistake.  5.Nxd4 would have been his best move, for this continuation.  He has violated General Opening Principles by bringing his queen out, this early.  Therefore, I will not hesitate to chase his queen with 5.Nc6.  Although, 5.Nc6! the obsession will cost me, and I will explain this momentarily.} Nc6 6. Qa4 b5 {?? I originally viewed this as a ! because I made this move to chase his queen, in my attempt to gain another tempo.  However, I was not thinking ahead and overlooked his LSB, due to this obsession.  It turns out to be a serious blunder for two reasons.  First, I will loose a pawn, after 7.Bxb5.  Most importantly, I am now in a lot of trouble, even though this is not the loosing blunder.  That is because this move will cause other problems, during the game.  In addition, I am going to chase more pieces throughout the game, due to my obsession.  This will eventually cause me to loose the game.  } 7. Bxb5 Bd7 {?? In this position, my knight is still pinned.  Therefore, I moved my LSB to undue the pin.  According to Jack Stockel, it is best to move your bishop, if you want to break a knight pin (get your knight unpinned).  However, 7...axb5 would have been my best move.  If 7...axb5, 8.Qxb5.  That way, my a pawn is exchanged for his LSB, so I am 3 points ahead.  If that happened, I would have been able to fix my previous mistake.  At this point, I am in even more trouble, due to my played move.  Consequently, he is going to win a free piece with 8.Bxc6.  } 8. Bxc6 Rc8 {?? At this point I realize that I can no longer attack his queen with my rook, so I decide to attack his bishop.  However, this turns out to be another serious blunder because he will place me in a very serious check with 9.Bxd7+.  What makes this serious?  That will be answered shortly.} 9. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {This move was forced.  As -chess- would say, "no options".  If I had played 8...Rc7!, 9.Bxd7+ would not have been feasible, or 9...Rxd7 loosing his LSB.  However, he is going to win another free pawn, due to this check, after 10.Qxa6.  That is what makes this check serious.  Remember: I am behind, so it is especially bad when I inadvertently give away material.  As Jack Stockel would say, "Don't give things away".} 10. Qxa6 Rc6 {? On a normal basis, I would not mark this.  However, my attitude is the mistake, not the actual move.  What is the logic behind this?  Well, I am still obsessed with trying to gain tempo by chasing pieces.  Therefore, I decided to chase his queen.} 11. Qa8+ {I honestly thought that he would retreat his queen.  However, he decides to place me in check, but this is a nuisance.} Rc8 {My attitude is still unrealistic.  However, this is a little, "more then meets the eye", as it is said.  I am also trying to trick him into a threefold repetition because I am still behind.  However, I will not be able to trick him, and that will be explained shortly.} 12. Qa3 {! He spots my trick, so he decides to play this move, as opposed to 12.Qa6.  I am not surprised because binblaster has illustrated the importance in knowing your opponents plans, as well as, your own.  In addition, ION said, "always assume your opponent will spot the threat", in one of my earlier annotations.} g6 {At first, I did not know why I chose this candidate.  As it turns out, I advanced my g7 pawn so that I could develop my DSB, but that does not happen.  Instead, my DSB will remain crammed, "jammed in", as Mr. Stockel would say.  According, to Jack it is a bad idea to leave your knight or bishop, "jammed in" as it puts you at a strategical disadvantage.  Note: a strategical disadvantage is more serious then a tactical disadvantage.  That is because I have learned that tactic=short term plan, but strategy=long term plan.} 13. Nd5 {! He decides to move his knight, in an attempt to play 13.Nb6!! forking my queen and rook.  However, I am not going to allow the fork.} Qc6 {I also could have played 13...Rc6, or 13...Qb6 to avoid the Q&R fork.  Both are equally effective and are, as good as, this played move.} 14. c3 {I do not know why he advanced his c2 pawn.} Qc4 {However, I decide to take advantage, by attacking his e4 pawn.  } 15. Nd2 {! This protects his pawn and attacks my queen.  15.f3 is the only other way that he can defend it.  Both are effective, but this is his best move.  If 15.f3, my queen is not in danger.  } Qd3 {?? At first, I had not idea why I moved my queen.  Then, I just figured out that this move was played because the threat of 16.Nxc4 was very high.  However, this turns out to be my loosing blunder, and I will explain this concept later on.} 16. Qa4+ {He decides to place me in check.  Although this is a mere nuisance, it could turn out to be very serious, and that will be explained shortly.} Kd8 {Aside from this move, 16...Rc6?? is the only other way to get out of check.  If, however, 16...Rc6, 17.Qxc6, loosing the rook.  However, the king is now exposed, as a result of being placed in check.} 17. Nb4 {! He decides to trap my queen so that it cannot retreat.  That way, he will win my queen, and I will go into more details momentarily.    } Rc5 {I figured that this is the only way that I can protect my most powerful piece, but I do not know what I was thinking because there is no safe place for my queen.  Like my first game against binblaster, my queen is trapped, as I had mentioned earlier.  Therefore, the game is now officially lost because he will win my queen, after 18.Nxd3.} 18. Nxd3 Rg5 {?? However, I am determined not to resign yet because Jack Stockel gives great advice.  What would he say?  First, "Don't give up, right away".  Second, "If you know that you can't win, try to get a draw".  Therefore, I decide to attack his g2 pawn, but this was a horrible choice.  That will be explained shortly. } 19. Qa8+ {This turns out to be very serious.  In this position, 19...Kd7, or 19...Kc7 are my only options.  After that, he will win another free piece after 20.Qxf8, so I will be 17 points behind.  In addition, he will attack my f7 pawn, after he takes my DSB.} Kd7 20. Qxf8 f5 {?? As I had mentioned earlier, my f pawn is now protected, but this is not a good choice.  20...f6 would have been best, for he will force an exchange with 21.exf5, Rxg2, but I am far behind.  On the other hand, 20...f6 also protects but without the exchange. } 21. exf5 Rxg2 22. Qg7 {At this point, I resign because he is going to win my h8 rook, and I have lost so much material, beforehand.  Therefore, I have no way of catching up.  In general, it is more important to think ahead then to obsess over chasing pieces and trying to gain tempi.  If you only concentrate on chasing pieces and tempo gain, you will not play as well.  That is what I learned, from this opponent.  Having said that, I would like to thank kibika for giving me this game.}
