[Opening "Two knights defence (C55)"]

1. e4 {This has become my standard opening now. I used to play the English, but since I stopped my rating has elevated.} e5 {Standard response. Glad it wasn't the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Giuoco Piano (the Quiet game)} Nf6 4. Nc3 Bc5 5. h3 {Keeping the knight and eventually a bishop off of g4.} d6 6. d3 Qe7 {Not sure if this is the best move. He should have moved out his bishop and got it developed before involving his queen. } 7. Bg5 {Pinning the Knight. (Other options included Ng5 or Be3 but I found these to be too passive and decided to keep pressure on him.)} Be6 {Trying to double my pawns and weaken my center.} 8. Bd5 Bxd5 9. Nxd5 {Threatening the Queen and a nasty K   R fork} Qd8 {Best move. This moves the Queen out of danger, protects the fork and keeps protection on the knight. ( ...Qd7  BxN gxB Nxg  and black loses his queen)} 10. Bxf6 {Ruining the kingsid pawns and developing a target on the new f pawn} gxf6 11. Nd2 {Preparing to bring Queen to the kingside} Nb4 {Trying to remove my knight from it's strong square.} 12. Nc3 {Retreat temporarily until I can remove his knight} Rg8 {Threatens the G pawn so...} 13. a3 {I threaten his knight and cause him to retreat} Nc6 14. g4 {Gaining space on the kingside and protecting the G pawn, but opens up the kingside too much and discourages me from castling in that direction} a6 15. Nd5 {Returning my knight to it's position of power.} Rg6 {Protecting the double f pawn} 16. b4 {Removes bishop from the center of the board where it could be come a thorn in my side.} Ba7 17. Nf3 {Bringing the knight back to the king side to engage with the rook} Nd4 {Attempts to trade knights} 18. Nh4 Rh6 19. Nf5 {Forking the knight and rook } Nxf5 20. exf5 {Bring another pawn to the weakend king side} c6 {Finally expelling my knight from the d5 square} 21. Ne3 Bd4 22. Rb1 Qb6 23. Qd2 Bxe3 24. Qxe3 Qxe3+ {Forced capture} 25. fxe3 Rh4 26. Kf2 {Bring the king into the action} O-O-O 27. Kg3 {Forcing the rook back to it's only available square} Rh6 28. c4 Kc7 29. a4 b6 {At this point the position is even. The remarkable part is that we both have all 8 pawns left and two rooks. When I reached this position I remember thinking that this was like something that you would do when you were just learning chess or like a chess puzzle. But notice that white still has the advantage because of the poor placing of Blacks rook on h6. It is completely immobile.} 30. e4 d5 {The Pawns start to disapeer} 31. cxd5 cxd5 32. Rbc1+ {Taking the open file} Kb7 33. Rc3 {Preparing to double rooks} dxe4 34. dxe4 {Continue the capturing process} Rd4 {Forks my two pawns} 35. Rhc1 Rxe4 {This move cost black the game} 36. Rc3c7+ Kb8 {At this point Black offers a draw because he was looking at 3 move repetition and forgot about my other rook.} 37. Rc7c8+ Kb7 38. Rc1c7# {Checkmated by his own pawn structure. This was the only game that Bob Alger lost this day. It was an interesting game and it removed my nerves for the rest of the tournament. Unfortunately though, the rest of my team lost their games.}
