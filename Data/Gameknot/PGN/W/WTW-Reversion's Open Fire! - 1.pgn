[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {It's a 1.e4, e5 opening, as the agreement is.  I decided to defend with 2...Nc6, as I'm prepared for things like the Ruy Lopez.  Plus, after 1...e5, he could also answer with, this move, but earlier, so 2.Bc4.  Forgot what that was called, but reversion played that against me, in our second game against each but the first one in this tourney.  It's interesting, though.  However, I was also prepared for the Guaco Piano, which this has become.} Bd6 {?! In which case, I try something different and play this.  However, I forgot that this is an inaccuracy as it blocks the center pawn.  In fact, I remember telling reachforgoals, one time, that it's not good for that reason.  I, on the other hand, forgot that since I don't know the main continuation after the Guaco Piano.  I think that best, however, was 3...Bc5.} 4. O-O {He starts taking advantage by castling.} Nf6 {However, I'm preparing and planning to do the same thing.} 5. d4 {Which he stops with this move, for if I castle, he doesn't just get a pawn.  But, taking would also cost me a piece due to the fork on my Nf6 and Bd6, combined with his Nf3.} exd4 {So, I take first.} 6. Re1 {Instead of taking back right away, he centralizes his Rook.  But, I know why as it's more then just centralization.  In other words, there's a bigger component to this.  If he forks, that R just adds pressure to the center, as well, which is also one of the main points to centralizing the Rook.} Be7 {So, I prevent him from winning a piece.} 7. e5 {With that being said, I'm no longer bothered by this move, as I had anticipated this, anyhow.} Ng8 {Although I don't enjoy undeveloping anything, it's the only way to protect my piece.  But, I will try to find a way to redevelop.  So, I do not feel pressure.  That's because I feel that I know what to do, and pressure is about not knowing what to do which isn't happening here.} 8. Bf4 {Presumably, he wants down the f4-c7 diagonal.} Bc5 {As noted earlier, however, I know what to do, and thus, don't feel pressure.  I'm putting pressure on his f2 pawn.  And, my plan is to somehow, if can safely be done, eliminate the c pawn.  Once again, my main interest is pinning the f2 pawn since it worked the first time that I did this combined with a different time.  First, however, it won't be safe here.  I guess this is where I finally realize that you do, afterall, have to base it on the position.  The problem is that I'm only thinking of one, as opposed to, multiple variations which is what's going to cost me the game here.  I remember what Kenneth_fire told me on studying many variations but ignored it here.  I figured out that this is also what it takes to figure out the story that the board is revealing.} 9. Ng5 {As now, he has pressure on my f7, instead.} Nh6 {Although I don't enjoy placing my N on the rim, it's the only defense.  Anything else, and he is going to win my Rh8, which I cannot allow.} 10. Ne4 {This is where I'm just beginning to feel pressure, as I didn't know what to do here.} d6 {?? But, that quickly gets eliminated here since my idea of a good time is exchanging.  However, I, as you might have guess also only consider one variation, and it's not his next move, either.  The line I was thinking along was 11.exd6, with the idea of 11...cxd6.  I also overlooked that he wins a pawn.  However, I consider this a serious blunder, as now, my King is badly exposed.  And, as you might guess, he will have a lot of attacking forces against it.  Needless to say that I wind up in a lot of trouble and can no longer castle.  So, best was 11.Nf5, as not only is my N better placed, but my monarch would not have winded opened up, like this.} 11. Bxh6 gxh6 12. Qh5 {This is where he starts swarming.  In fact, it's actually similar to when bhidragon played Qh6.  The difference is that his Queen didn't move, until now.  The result, however, is the same as he building up his army against my monarch, which like that game, I'm going to miss and will pay.} Qe7 {I thought that this was the only way to save the position, for now, because, unlike that game, I'm trying to use my Queen to protect my monarch.  In other words, it's not out of play.  But, I'll need a lot more.} 13. exd6 {However, it's much worse then that.  Were it safe, I'd take back with my c pawn.  The problem is, though, that it would leave my Queen pinned which forces my next move, and thus, still leaves my monarch weakened.  And, when this happens, I'm going to lose a piece, without compensation.  Plus, the move that follows will be forced, since I'll be in check.} Qf8 14. Nxc5+ Kd8 15. d7 {As now, he's threatening to win my B.} Bxd7 {Figuring that not only have I protected a piece but gotten a pawn back, I took.  And, yes, I didn't even attempt to consider multiple variations.  The line that I was thinking along was an exchange with 16.Nxd7, Kxd7.  After which, it'd appeared that I'd be safe the problems would be close to eliminated.  In the process, however, this is only the beginning as I missed there is, like that other game, much more to the story then meets the eye.} 16. Qd5 {As he is going to win a piece.} b6 {?? And, this is the main area where I really overlooked the overall picture and told reachforgoals not to do in two of our training games.  The difference is that I wasn't hyperfocused on tempo gain.  If that were so, this move wouldn't have come into consideration.  But, it is, however, not thinking about the overall picture is what did me in here.  Ok, I was thinking about his next move, but after which and getting out of check, my idea was ...bxc5 preventing the loss of a piece.  What I didn't consider, however, is that his next move is mate since my monarch cannot get out.  With that being said, I had to give up my Queen with 16...Qd6 to save the game.  16...Kc8 doesn't work.  if 17.Qd7+, Kb8  18.Na6+, Kb7 19.Qc7# is still mate.    } 17. Qxd7# {The moral of this story is to see the overall picture by trying to figuring what the board is revealing, as opposed to, thinking about one or two details.  The way to do this is by attempting to calculate multiple, as opposed to, only one variation.  That's because I, once again, got fixated on one or two things, as opposed to, how the games developing by only calculating one possibility and not even trying to consider other variations.}
