1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 d5 4. Bb5 Nf6 5. Bxe5 {I aim to "keep the draw in hand" from this point on. Even though it's an unrated game, a draw against someone 200 points higher than me would be most acceptable. A win would be even better, but a draw would be fine.} Bd6 6. Bxd6 Qxd6 7. Nf3 {Both of us are ready to castle.} O-O 8. O-O a6 9. Be2 h6 10. c4 {I want to ensure I don't get squeezed on the Q-side.} Bf5 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. Nc3 {Aiming to drive back the centralized Queen.} Qd6 13. d4 g5 14. Ne1 {I aim to reposition my Knight.} Kg7 15. Bd3 Bxd3 16. Nxd3 {The more pieces that are exchanged off, the less chance I have of losing.} Nd5 17. Nxd5 Qxd5 18. Rc1 f5 19. h3 {To create an air hole for the King and prevent my opponent's Pawns from surging too far forward on the K side.} Rf7 20. Rc5 Qd6 21. Ne5 {Looking to exchange off another piece.} Nxe5 22. Rxe5 b6 23. Qc2 {Focusing on the weakened Pawn at KB4. If I can get up a second Pawn, I can shift the game from "drawish" to "probable win".} Kg6 24. g4 Raf8 25. gxf5+ {My opponent has successfully defended the Pawn, but I see a chance to trade off the heavy artillery. } Rf7xf5 26. Rxf5 Rxf5 27. f4 {If I can play PxP, I can add an attacker to the pinned Rook.} Qe6 28. Qd3 {First I have to defend my own Pawn.} Kf6 29. fxg5+ {Here we go. Time to vaporize the pieces and kill off any Black winning chances.} hxg5 30. Rxf5+ Qxf5 31. Qxf5+ {Mission accomplished. Now I have a draw, and if Black mishandles the endgame, I can get a win out of it.} Kxf5 32. Kf2 Ke4 33. Ke2 {Now it's a battle for the Opposition.} a5 34. a3 b5 35. b4 axb4 36. axb4 {Which he wins, having one more Pawn move in reserve.} c6 37. Kf2 Kd3 38. Kf3 {I calculate that he can't beat me in the race to Queen.} Kc4 39. Kg4 Kxb4 40. Kxg5 Kc4 41. h4 {We will both Queen simultaneously.} b4 42. h5 b3 43. h6 b2 44. h7 b1=Q 45. h8=Q Qg1+ 46. Kf4 {Draw agreed. Even though I'm a pawn up, with an open board and a Queen on each side the perpetual check looms.}
