[Opening "King's pawn game (C44)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d3 {(!?)  Very unusual (compared with 3.Bb5, 3.Bc4, 3.Nc3, 3.d4), but the move is not bad.  It can lead into the king's Indian Attack, with the bishop developing at e2 or (more likely) g2.} d6 {A cagey response.  Black doesn't want to over-commit in the face of White's idiosyncratic choice of opening.} 4. d4 {(?) Now this really is bizarre.  In effect Whate has sacrificed a tempo in a Scotch Game/Philidor Defence type of game.} Bg4 {A handy pin.  What will white make of it?} 5. h3 {(?) Often it is a good idea to smack the bishop about after it sets up a pin like like, forcing Black to decide (if she hasn't already) to take or not on f3.  But here it will lose a pawn.  The right move was 5.d5, keeping the game more or less level.} Bxf3 {(!) Wins the pawn at d4.} 6. Qxf3 {Best, to preserve the shape of the K-side pawns.  But it will cost White a tempo at least.  The d-pawn is, of course, a goner whatever White did.} Nxd4 {Again, preferable to capturing with the pawn...} 7. Qd3 {Blocks the light-square bishop (LSB), but going back to d1 was not enticing, and on c3 she would have blocked the knight... or the c-pawn...} Nf6 8. c3 {(?!) An obvious move to make, to drive away the enemy knight, but it hampers his own Knight's development.  The Gameknot Engine (GKE) likes 8.Be3, the threat being to exchange on d4 and recover the pawn.  Black can defend easily enough (...Nc6 or ...c5) but White would have, within constraints,  a fairly easy development.} Nc6 9. Bg5 Be7 10. Be2 d5 {(?) A desirable break, but played much too early.  Black should lose a pawn, here, bring material back to even...} 11. Bxf6 dxe4 {(??)  The miscalculation, I suspect, really happened a move earlier.  Now Black loses a piece.} 12. Qxd8+ {(!) Not afraid, in a good cause, to exchange Queens.} Rxd8 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Nd2 {Developing and attacking the lead e-pawn.  Very well.  Black has two pawns for the Bishop, and a considerable centre that she probably ought to preserve by ...f5.  Still, White must have the advantage here, once he unravels his pieces a bit.} O-O {(?)  It is quite understandable that Bolack wanted to mobilise quickly and hope thereby to put up some sort of fight.  A rating differential of 100 ELO can be for some players a powerful motivator!  But she would in my view have done better to have tried ...f5 here with a view to creating some problems for White with the imposing central pawn phalanx.} 15. Nxe4 b6 {Keeping the White Knight out of c5.} 16. O-O f5 {(!?) See next move by Black...} 17. Bc4+ {(!) Beginning a sequence that will win further material..} Kh8 {(?!) The GKE calls thsi a mistake, indicating 17...Nd5 (though after 18.Ng5 Rfe8  19.Rfe1 e4  20.Nf3! Kf7  21.Red1 exf3  22.Bxd5ch Kf6  23.Bxf3 c5  24.Rxd8 Rxd8  25.Re1 Rd2  26.Re2 Rxe2  27.Bxe2  the ending ought to be a comfortable win for White, with his Bishop extra).  But probably the real error was a move earlier, when 16...h6 (instead of ...f5) would have prevented all this.  But who knew?} 18. Ng5 {(!)  With forks at e6 and f7 threatened.  "Was there a cure? 'The higher the fewer!' the learned doctor said." (Spike Milligan - 'Maveric Prowles').  What cure there is will still cost Black something.} Nd5 {(?) Desperation, that allows the Knight fork at e6.  The loss of the exchange, of course, implies that Black will be down a rook in the sequel.  The move preferred by the GKE would not have prevented the loss of the exchange, neither: 18...Rd6  19.Rfd1! - no need to rush - 19...Nc8  20.Nf7ch Rxf7  21.Bxf7 etc.  By 18...Rd2, Black keeps the exchange, but the result isn't very encouraging: 18...Rd2  19.Nf7ch Kg8  20.Nxe5ch Kh8  21.Nf7ch Kg8  22.Rfe1 Ng6(best)  23.Rad1 Rxb2  24.Ne5+! Kh8  25.Rd8! Rxd8 (else Black loses yet more material)  26.Nf7ch Kg8  27.Nxd8ch Kf8  (a reprieve!)  28.Ne6ch Ke7  29.Nxg7ch... Note the action of the Knight and Bishop - a species of the well-known 'windmill' motif.  Very nasty when you get caught in one.} 19. Ne6 {One door closes; another door opens...} Nf6 20. Nxd8 Rxd8 21. Rad1 {The beauty of the situation for white is that he can offer 'even' exchanges as threats to gain progress.  That is why taking the d8-rook was better than taking on f8.  White steals a march, as Black dare not exchange rooks.} Rf8 22. Rd2 {Guess what this modest advance portends!} e4 23. Rfd1 {(!) Obvious, but still good.  White can now force off a pair of rooks.  Fine exploitation of the material plus.} Ne8 {(?) A valiant attempt to avert disaster.  But this is a mistake that invites a catastrophe!} 24. Rd2d8 {(!) Carry on, Sarn't! The knight is pinned against the rook; and the King can not in time come to the rescue.  A terrible bind.  Black must lose a piece here...} g5 {Black's game has become completely hopeless.  For all her struggles, she is being outplayed; White's extra rook and the cramp on Black's position are too great to overcome.  She might well have resigned here - it's a convenient moment - but chose instead to carry on to the bitter end.  Now, some find this sort of thing rather objectionable, but they ought not to do so.  Even if the opponent is being merely bloody-minded about the whole thing, you don't know this.  There are all sorts of motivations that might keep one playing on in a hopeless situation.  For one thing, Black might have considered the situation, given the rating difference, not without hope at that.  In any case not all hopeless positions are hopeless (check out some of my other annotated games, e.g. 'Die Hard').  Or it might have been an act of discipline, or  a learning exercise (teaching herself to look for the defensive or counter -attacking possibilities in  difficult circumstances).  Having played on, Black did her opponent this courtesy: she allowed him to deliver the final checkmate.} 25. Bf7 {(!)  Now, the GKE regards this as a mistake, and it is true that 25.Bb5! won a piece for nothing.  But there are reasons for my regarding this rather clever move as pretty nearly as good.  Once the minor pieces go, Black will be able to keep her rook only at the cost of a pawn or two.  In an ending like this, the win of a pawn would for White be just about as valuable as the win of a piece.} Rxf7 26. Rxe8+ Kg7 27. Rdd8 {(!?)  Rooks doubled on the 8th rank can be very handy, but I would still have preferred 27,Red8 myself, threatening rook exchanges that Black could avoid only at the cost of a couple of pawns.} Kh6 28. g4 {(!) Good move: breaking up Black's last asset, her K-side majority.} fxg4 29. Re6+ {(?) Mixing ideas.  Better was 29.hxg4 first, to keep back Black's king.} Kg7 {(?) Black might as well have carried on with such counterplay as she could glean from the situation: ...Kh5.} 30. hxg4 h6 31. Ree8 Kf6 {Now Black's last rook HAS to come off.  Nor could it have been avoided.  See Black's 33rd move and the sequel.} 32. Rd5 {I would simply have played 32.Rff8 and exchanged rooks.} Kg7 33. Rdd8 {We've been here before!  } Rf4 {Black might have tried 33...Kf6 and see if White would fall into a threefold repetition.  Not that that was likely.   This attempt to avoid rook exchanges is no more successful than any other try would have been.  But it was worth testing White's resolution, his having failed to force off the rooks a move or so ago.} 34. Rd7+ {Clever.  Also good was 34.Rg8ch but this works just as well, and will pick up some pawns, too.} Rf7 {Bingo!  The GKE indicates 24...Kf6 but after 25.Rf8ch Kg6  26.Rxf4 gxf4  27.Rxc7 Black's centre pawns can't hope to make head against the White Rook, e.g. 27...Kg5  28.Rc4 e3  29.f3 Kh4  30.Kg2 ... 31.Re4 ... 32.c4.} 35. Ree7 {(!) A neat finesse.  The rooks still come off, but White ensures his remaining one gets onto the 7th rank at once.} Rxe7 36. Rxe7+ Kf6 37. Rxc7 {Although there was nothing against taking the e-pawn, I would also have chosen, as White has, to set up the Q-side pawn majority for White.} Ke5 38. Kg2 {OK: White does well to be cautious.  But I would probably have chosen 38.Rxa7 Kf4  39.Ra6 Kxg4  40.Rxb6; or 39...b5  40.Rxh6.  With nothing to oppose them, White's could have shove home one of the Q-side pawns to promote; otherwise, with the h-pawn gone, Black would have lost the last vestige of attack.} Kf4 {Stil trying gamely to conjure up counterplay ...} 39. Re7 Kxg4 40. Rxe4+ Kf5 41. Re8 {I think I would have played 41.f3 and then 42.c4.  But this move is fine.} h5 42. Rf8+ {Unnecessary.  The Black King was cut off from the Q-side, and so the White pawns could have begun their charge on that flank: 42.c4!  Note that neither of the other pawn moves are as good (42.b4 b5; 42.a4 a6), though White is so far ahead they would still have won.  After 42.c4 a5  43.b3!, White's pawns grind forward against Black's resistance by 44.a3... 45.b4... 46.c5 etc.} Kg4 {(?) Allows White to cut off the King again.} 43. Kh2 {Preferable are 43.c4 or 43.f3ch...} h4 {Now White can close down the K-side altogether.} 44. f3+ Kh5 45. Kh3 {That's it for Black's resistance: she has nothing left in her shot locker.  But I guess she wanted to see White's technique.  It has been good enough so far!} Kg6 46. Kg4 {All roads lead to Rome.  I probably would have played here 46.c4 Kg7  47.Rf5 Kg6  48.Kg4 h3  49.Rxg5ch Kf6  50.Rh5 etc.} a5 47. Rb8 a4 48. Rxb6+ Kf7 49. Rh6 Kg7 50. Kxg5 h3 51. Rxh3 {This could have waited: 51.c4, or maybe 51.b4 axb3e.p. 52.axb3. } Kg8 52. Kg6 {Much better was 52.Kf6! with mate in 3: 52.Kf6 a3  53.b3 Kf8  54.Rh8#} a3 53. bxa3 {Possibly Black was hoping White would get a bit too clever, e.g. 54.f4? axb2  55.Rd3 b1=Q Oops!  But White could have 'played to the gallery' by 53.Rh4!? axb3  54.Rb4 b1=Qch  55.Rxb1 Kf8  56.Re1 and mate next move.  A more forcing line was available in 53.Kf6! axb2  54.Rh1 b1=Q  55.Rxb1 Kh7  56.Rb8  Kh6  57.Rh8#.  Check out that last line.  All Black's moves are forced.  Having said that, with the disappearance of her last pawn vanishes whatever hope Black might have had of salvaging the game.} Kf8 54. Rh7 Kg8 {(? Relatively speaking) But 54...Ke8  55.Kf6 Kd8  56.Ke6 Kc8  57.Kd6 Kb8  58.Kc6 Ka8  59.Kb6 Kb8  60.Rh8#.  How to run the fugitive King to earth.} 55. c4 {Instead 55.Rf7 ended the game at once.  I suspect that Black might deliberately have chosen ...Kg8 as a form of resignation, allowing an early mate.} Kf8 56. c5 Ke8 57. c6 Kd8 58. Kf6 Kc8 59. Ke6 Kd8 {Else 59...Kb8  60.Kd6 Ka8  61.Rh8ch Ka7  62.Kc5 Ka6  63.Ra8#} 60. Kd6 Ke8 61. c7 Kf8 62. c8=Q# {A good win by id=chicoboy against opposition rated over 100 ELO ahead of him.  Once having gained the upper hand he was always in control, and never once looked as though he would let the game slip.  His opponent did her best to set him problems to solve, but lacked the resources to put serious obstacles in his path.  Beginners and early level players might find this game worth playing through just to observe the technique of 'winning the win'.}
