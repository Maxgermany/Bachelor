1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 Bf5 {Following my favorite scheme, but with black pieces. } 4. d3 Nbd7 5. Nbd2 e5 6. c4 {Interesting. } d4 {I'm self-blocking my pieces, but I wanted to control the advance e4.} 7. O-O c6 {defending b7, and opening the way for my queen. And leaving c5 for a minor piece. Nothing special. } 8. e4 {A mistake, since d3 is undefended.} dxe3 e.p. 9. fxe3 Bxd3 10. Rf2 {Here it is not easy for me to say which is the best. I choosed...} e4 11. Ne1 {Of course, trading the nice bishop.} Bc5 {Just "fuzzying" the scenario, threatening e3.} 12. Nb3 {Defending and attacking, good.} Qb6 {Defending and attacking, good.} 13. Nxc5 Nxc5 {No point in taking with the queen. No tricks involving Bxe4 (leaving the minor piece in d3 undefended), since Nxe4 threats the rook, too. } 14. Nxd3 Nxd3 {Here: BxN, NxB, QxN, NxR... I win the exchange.} 15. Rf1 {Rd2, Qxe3+.} O-O-O {I love to castle attacking... Even before: NxB, QxN, Ng4, Re1, Rd6 was unstoppable. But I liked the o-o-o move... not wise. Now, white has RxNf6, Qg4+, Bxe4... a whorty sac.} 16. Qb3 {My opponent try to losen the pressure by exchanging queen, but I am not compelled to exchange.} Qc5 17. Bd2 {White cannot place a rook on e2, this is all the story.} Rhe8 {Why hurry? Now, Ng4 wins... "once I take my king away from the white diagonal".} 18. Bc3 {BLUNDER, white cannot afford the loss of e3. No merit by my side. } Qxe3+ 19. Kh1 Ng4 {My blunder, in the sense that if now white plays Bh3, my knight is pinned (or exchanged), and there is no mate. I could have won, but not in the nice way I did. } 20. Rxf7 {Threatening mate in one, but overlooking...} Ngf2+ 21. Kg1 Nh3+ {Incredibly enough, with Kf1 white could have saved the day, as I realized later. Black has to defend from mate in one (Qxb7#) and black loses the knight. And how can black defend? Nc5, attacking the queen, doesn't work:  BxN+, Kb8, Be5+, winning the queen. Rd7 or b6 were not good either, losing a piece. So Kh1 was a big blunder by white, and the nice mate pattern is not such... chessi is wonderful :-)} 22. Kh1 Qg1+ 23. Rxg1 Nhf2+ 24. Rxf2 Nxf2# {...This simple still higly effective mate pattern. It happens in real life.  }
