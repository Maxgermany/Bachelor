1. e4 g6 {This was the last game in the Tournament, and Herr von Bardeleben has to win the game if he wanted to be amongst the prize winners.  he adopted, therefore, an opening which is but little analysed and allows of complications.} 2. d4 Bg7 3. c3 d6 4. Be3 Nd7 5. Bc4 Ngf6 6. Nd2 e5 7. d5 {A very bad move, especially after he has developed the Bishop to c4.} O-O 8. h4 Nb6 9. Be2 Ne8 10. h5 f5 {Quite right; the attack of the first player need not be feared with all his pieces blocked in.} 11. hxg6 hxg6 12. f3 f4 13. Bf2 Bf6 14. g3 fxg3 15. Bxg3 Ng7 16. Qc2 Nh5 17. Bf2 Nf4 18. O-O-O Kg7 19. Be3 Rh8 20. Rxh8 Qxh8 21. Bxf4 exf4 22. Nb3 Bd7 23. Bd3 Qh5 24. Nd4 Qe5 25. Qg2 Qg5 26. Qxg5 Bxg5 {Black has by far the best of the end game; his rook is able to take possession of the open file and the f3-pawn is very weak.} 27. Nge2 Rh8 28. Nb5 Bxb5 29. Bxb5 a6 30. Bd3 Nd7 31. Nd4 Ne5 32. Ne6+ Kf6 33. Be2 Rh2 34. Rd2 Rh3 35. Nxc7 Nxf3 36. Rd3 Rh1+ 37. Rd1 Rxd1+ 38. Kxd1 Nh2 {Having conducted the whole end game with great skill and accuracy, herr von Bardeleben reaps now the benefit of his superior strategy.   White has to give a piece for the passed pawn.} 39.
