1. e4 {1. e4 is very logical.  In terms of space, it occupies a center square (e4) and attacks another one (d5).  It also attacks f5 which can be considered part of the extended center.  In terms of development, it opens the f1-a6 diagonal for the bishop, and the d1-h5 diagonal for the queen.  Its drawbacks are few, but they do exist.  Pawns cannot retreat, so the e-pawn can never help secure the d4 or f4 squares.  Lastly, the e-pawn itself may come under attack.} c5 {The Sicilian defense immediately introduces an imbalance into the game.} 2. c4 {In some ways this is an effort to restore symmetry.  The d4 square is seriously weakened, however, because no white pawn can fight for control over it.  This is a significant concession so early in the game.} Nc6 {Naturally, black develops with an eye towards securing d4 permanently.} 3. Nf3 {White might be mixing systems.  The king knight belongs on e2, if white wishes to play with pawns on c4, d3, and e4.  White would then fianchetto the king bishop.  That's the normal Nimzo-Botvinnik system. } g6 {Again, developing with an eye on d4.} 4. Nc3 {The last chance to transpose into a "normal" Sicilian was 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 leading to a Maroczy bind.  Once a feared continuation, it has been fairly well established in modern theory that black has adequate defensive resources.} Bg7 {Now, white cannot play d4.} 5. d3 {As mentioned in a previous note, the king knight belongs on e2 in this pawn formation.} d6 {Continuing to seek control of the dark center squares and opening the c8-h3 diagonal for the bishop.} 6. Be3 {Seeking to contest Black's control over d4.} Nf6 {Black is thinking about driving the bishop on e3 from its post by playing a timely Ng4.} 7. h3 {A possibility that white removes, but at the cost of a tempo.} O-O {Black is ahead in development.  Now that he has castled kingside, he will try to secure a spatial advantage on the queenside.} 8. Be2 {The bishop is very passively placed on e2, but white needs to complete his development..} a6 {Black wishes to advance on the queenside in order to secure more space.} 9. O-O Rb8 {Again, with the idea of expanding on the queenside with b7-b5.} 10. a3 {10. a4 with the idea of contesting black's expansion plans was better, although that cedes the b4 square to the black knight.  Black would continue with Nb4, Bd7, and an eventual b7-b5.} b5 {Black has secured a spatial advantage.  If the pawn gets to b4 it will also increase the range of the bishop on g7, which is already the best minor piece on the board.} 11. cxb5 {It would be better to grin and bear the advance of black's queenside pawns.  The capture on b5 does nothing to stop the expansion, and only weakens white's control over d5.} axb5 12. b3 {Now, the g7 bishop has the entire diagonal a1-h8 to itself.  Notice that 12. ...Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bxa1 14. Qxa1 is better for white.  The two pieces are better than rook   p.  The bishop on g7 is far too valuable to give up in such an exchange. } b4 {12. ...Ng4 was possible, but the text creates an isolated white pawn on a half-open file, which will become a defensive burden. } 13. axb4 Nxb4 {It is important in situations such as this to capture with a piece.  13. ...cxb5 would be a mistake.  The text saddles white with a serious weakness in pawn structure.  See how black's pawns are coordinated and solid.  The white pawn on b3 by contrast is alone and blockaded.} 14. Bd2 {Guarding the knight on c3 and shifting the bishop's attention from d4 to b4, but black still wants to control both of those squares.} Nc6 {This retreat uncovers an attack on the b-pawn.  White's queen wants to do more important things than guard a pawn!} 15. Ra3 {Coming to the poor pawn's aid.} h6 {Black wants to play Be6 without being harassed by a white knight moving to g5.} 16. Nd5 {It's hard to formulate a plan for white now, but this move leads to a loss of material.  Notice how black first secured a spatial advantage, transformed that into an advantage in pawn structure and is now converting that into a material advantage.} Nxd5 17. exd5 Nb4 {Now, it is the d5 pawn's turn to come under attack.} 18. d4 {At last!  It's a good move, and the only try to save the position.} cxd4 {I didn't like 18. ...Nxd5 19. Ba5 followed by 20. dxc5.} 19. Bxb4 Rxb4 20. Bc4 {White has saved the d5 pawn. and hopes to capture the d4 pawn in order to restore material balance.  However, in order to do so, white has surrendered the two-bishops.  The two bishops are generally superior to a bishop and knight.  This is especially true in open positions with pawns on both sides of the board.} Qb6 {Defending the d4 pawn.} 21. Re1 {The pawn on d5 is cramping black's game a little bit.  White attacks the pawn on e7, which cannot advance without being lost.} Re8 {Rook's don't want pawn guard duty any more than queen's do.  Perhaps, 21. ...Bf6 was better.} 22. Re4 {An attempt to win the d4 pawn.  It is now attacked three times and defended only twice.} Bf5 {Black finally completes his development.  It had not been clear where to position this bishop until this moment.  White doesn't have time to capture the d4 pawn, unless he willing to sacrifice material.} 23. Ra6 {An interesting moment in the game.  I have often seen this sort of mistake.  Just as people often trade a rook and pawn for two minor pieces (usually a mistake) so they'll trade two rooks for a queen (usually a mistake).  If the two rooks become coordinated, they can over power the queen.} Bxe4 {Two rooks add up to 10 points, while the queen only counts for 9.} 24. Rxb6 Bxf3 {An important in-between move.  24. ...Rxb6 allows white to win a pawn with 25. Nxd4.} 25. Qxf3 Rxb6 {Now, the forced captures are over and the situation clear.  Black has 6 pawns to white's 5, two rooks for the queen.  Black has achieved material superiority, but must consolidate and coordinate his forces.} 26. Qg4 {With an eye towards 27. Qd7.} Rb7 {Which black prevents.} 27. Qf3 {White is marking time until black tips his hand.} Ra8 {Seizing the only open file.} 28. g3 {Creating additional luft for the white king.} Ra1+ {Black penetrates into white territory, and begins to activate his forces.} 29. Kg2 Bf6 {Part of the consolidation.  Black wants to defend the e7 pawn, and clear g7 for the king, at which point the king will be fairly secure.} 30. Kh2 {White marks time.30. h4 might've been better.} Kg7 {Eliminating any Qg4, Qc8 type tactics.} 31. Qg4 Ra2 {The f-pawn is a target, but black is really trying to advance the d-pawn at the right moment.} 32. Qf3 d3 {Here it is.  33. Qxd3 Rxf2  puts white's king in jeopardy, while 33. Bxd3 allows 33. ...Rxb3 with a clear advantage to black.} 33. h4 {Too little, too late.} d2 {Now, the d-pawn is a major threat to promote.} 34. Qg4 {34. Be2 was much better, although Black will break through by transferring both rooks to the 8th rank and playing d2-d1.} Ra1 {Threatening to queen the pawn.} 35. Bd3 {36. Be2 was mandatory, but after 36. ...Rxb3 black will force further material concessions.} d1=Q {0-1.  Chess is often about acquiring one type of advantage (such as one in space) and cashing it in for another one (e. g. pawn structure).  A lead in development can often lead to a material advantage as the defender gives up material in order to stave off an attack.  A lead in development is a temporary advantage and needs to be cashed in before it dissipates.  A spatial advantage tends to be more permament, as long as you deny your opponent any freeing moves.  In this game, white needed to play d4 in order to free his game, and black tried to discourage it.  White finally played d4, but at the cost of a pawn.}
