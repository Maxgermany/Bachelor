1. e4 {Hi everyone!  ..... in this game I managed to stay alert and patient and I tried something on the kingside late on in the endgame and it worked!  Yup, I have conceded a couple of low draws lately in my rated games because there seemed to be no way whatsoever of forcing a victory (and one of those low draws was against Delta the Master Blaster who I knew not to mess with!).  Class B and C players are certainly capable of nasty things against me, so I know when to hold out the olive branch.  However, in this case I got lucky.  Here is how it goes (it starts off with a Scandinavian/Centre Counter Defense with 1. e4 d5) and here is the gameknot analysis.http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16301005&rnd=0.1441176371074478} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 {2. ...... Qxd5 - the main line.  It does bring out the queen very early but this defense can pack a punch.} 3. Nc3 Qa5 {3. ..... Qa5 - this is considered the best square in the Centre Counter.  It will take a few moves before I can harass the Wicked Witch of the West.} 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 {5. Nf3 - development.} Bf5 6. Bc4 c6 7. Bd2 {7. Bd2 - Fou Lenoir emerges and lines up against the Witch.} e6 8. Qe2 {8. Qe2 - and Glenda puts pressure on e6.} Bb4 9. O-O-O Nbd7 10. a3 Bxc3 11. Bxc3 {11. Bxc3 - B for N trade.} Qc7 12. Ne5 Nxe5 13. Qxe5 Qxe5 14. dxe5 Nd5 {14. ..... Nd5 - over the last few moves there have been a series of trades and we are now moving towards an endgame.} 15. Bd4 O-O {15. ...... 0-0 and black castles kingside.} 16. f3 a6 17. Bxd5 cxd5 {17. ..... B for N trade and we now have opposite bishops.  Both pairs of rooks are on so there is still some possibility of a result here.} 18. Rhe1 Rfc8 19. Rd2 Rc6 20. Re3 Rac8 {20. ..... Rac8 - a doubling on the c column, but one of the rooks is about to be traded off.} 21. Rc3 Rc6xc3 22. Bxc3 {22. Bxc3 - voila!} b5 23. Ba5 h6 24. c3 Bh7 {24. ..... Bh7 - not much happening here.  Can I make things happen?} 25. Rd4 {24. Rd4 - I try.} g6 26. Kd2 Kf8 27. Rh4 {27. Rh4 - my finger has been hovering over the Offer Draw button for the last few moves.  I now see that I can certainly make something happen here though.  First I make the h6 pawn a target.} h5 28. g4 {28. g4 - and now the h pawn is pinned against the black lsb I pile up on it.} Rc4 29. b3 {29. b3 - black's move looked aggressive, but I think I can foil his plans.  Whatever I do, though I must not put Henry on d3 - can you see why not?} Rf4 30. Ke3 {30. Ke3 - so now Henry goes to e3 and suddenly his rook is ........ trapped.} g5 {30. ..... g5 - nacht, but .....} 31. Rxh5 Bg6 32. Rxg5 {32. Rxg5 - and now black must lose heavy material.} f6 33. Rxg6 {33. Rxg6 - black can now avoid losing his rook by fxe5 but he will be a piece and a pawn down.  My opponent decided this was too much and waved the white flag.  A nice ending.}
