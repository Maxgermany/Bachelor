1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I try again to get piece activity, it lasts a while but alas I could not maintain it.  A dubious pawn push on my part results in me getting tied up in knots yet again.  Freddy wins 2 pawns and forces liquidation into a lost K & P ending while maintaining his 2 pawn advantage.  I start with e4 and Freddy springs another favourite response of his, the Alekhine's Defense.} Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 Nb6 4. c4 {4. c4 - standard pawn moves in the Alekhine.} d6 5. exd6 exd6 {5. ....... exd6 - pawn trade.} 6. Nc3 Be7 7. Bd3 {7. Bd3 - development.} Nc6 8. Nge2 O-O 9. O-O Bf6 10. Be3 {10. Be3 - the back rank is almost clear.} Nb4 11. b3 Nxd3 12. Qxd3 {12. Qxd3 - piece trade.} Re8 13. Rae1 c6 14. Ng3 d5 15. c5 {15. c5 - so far so good.} Nd7 16. Bf4 Nf8 {16. ........ Nf8 - taking me out of the database.  Freddy does not exchange rooks here as it will result in my rook controlling the e file.  I decide against trading rooks because that would allow the Wicked Witch of the West to control the e file.  If I contest this then my d pawn will fall to the black dsb.} 17. Bd6 {17.  Bd6 - Here I decide to try and keep Fou Lenoir outside the pawn chain and to try and exert a cramp on Freddy.  I thought of this game when I did it - http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/operation-joblock-success.pl?gm=23188 - and thought it was worth trying out on Freddy.} Ne6 {17. ....... Ne6 - putting pressure on d4.  I am wondering whether, instead of my next move 18. Nce2 whether Nf5 was a good follow up here.  If g6 then Nh6+.  Does this idea have any flaws?  You the jury decide.} 18. Nce2 g6 19. f4 {19. f4 - thoughts of g5 here, breaking open Freddy's castled position.  Freddy discourages this with Ng7.} Ng7 20. Be5 {20. Be5?! - Freddy had this to say about this move and the next two moves.  "The pawn push was not so bad. I think 22. h3 was too early - it should have been something like Nc1 you force the trade on your terms and keep control of your position. Also something to consider was 21. f5 instead of 21. Bxf6, it sacrifices a pawn but your position becomes more active and the pawn can be taken back later." } h5 21. Bxf6 Qxf6 22. h3 Bd7 23. Nh1 {23. Nh1 - now I become cramped.} Re7 24. Qd2 Rae8 {24. ...... Rae8 - an ominous doubling on the e file putting pressure on e2.} 25. Nf2 Nf5 {25. ....... Nf5 - putting pressure on d4 now.} 26. Nd1 {26. Nd1 - something has to give, something has to give ......} Nxd4 {26. ...... Nxd4 - ..... and give it does - a pawn to Freddy for starters.} 27. Nxd4 Re7xe1 28. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 29. Qxe1 Qxd4+ {29. ....... Qxd4+ - after that plethora of exchanges Freddy is now set to win my c5 pawn.} 30. Kf1 Qxf4+ {30. ..... Qxf4+ - but it is the f pawn that falls.} 31. Qf2 Qc1 32. Qd4 {32. Qd4 - I could play Qe1 but here I decide to play a more aggressive defensive alternative, Qd4 - doesn't do much good but at least it gets me into the habit of making Glenda a little less passive.} Bf5 33. Ke1 Bc2 {33. ........ Bc2 - this move forces a piece trade into a losing K & P ending for me.} 34. Qd2 Qxd2+ 35. Kxd2 Bxd1 36. Kxd1 Kg7 {36. ..... Kg7 - Freddy now activates his king.  I decide to play on a few moves until the zugzwang.} 37. Ke2 Kf6 38. Ke3 Kg5 39. g3 {39. g3 - to stop the BK moving any further, but now Freddy rolls down his f pawn.} f5 40. Kd4 {40. Kd4 - maybe Kf3 was an improvement but then Freddy has a d5 passer.} f4 41. gxf4+ {41. gxf4+ - here I decided to resign the game on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  I could have played on a few more moves but I was about to go away on holiday and I could see that the BK could take my h pawn and walk home his kingside pawns.  It was therefore not worth postponing that game and stalling Freddy so I resigned.  Well, I have just returned from my holiday in sunny Hastings and am slowly getting back into the groove so watch this space.}
