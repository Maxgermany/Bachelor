1. e4 d6 2. Bc4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Ng5 {Mistake, white moves twice the same piece in the opening} e6 5. d3 d5 {Black also moves twice the same piece but for immediate attack} 6. Qf3 {Good move but risky !} Nf6 {Mistake. Black should have plaid Qf6} 7. exd5 {Good move} exd5 {Black had little choice if he wants to avoid being in late in material} 8. Bb3 {Mistake. White should have plaid 8.Qe3+ if 8. ... Be6 9. Nxe6 if 9... fxe6 10. Qxe6+ Qe7 11. Qxe7 Kxe7 and black cannot castle. Otherwise, black loses at least a pawn.} O-O {Black has now 4 pieces out (counting the castle as one) against 4 for white.} 9. Be3 Re8 10. O-O {Forced move} Be6 11. Bd4 {White moves once more twice the same piece.} Nc6 {Evident move. } 12. Nxe6 {Probably a mistake. It opens the file for the black rook and white hasn't developp his b knight, so that his rooks won't be joined, this e file will be of particular importance for the rest of the game. When one is in late in developpement, he shouldn't open the game.} Rxe6 13. Be3 {To avoid the fork attack 13. ... Nd4} Ne5 {Black's next idea is to take control of the center, get rid of the b3 bishop and prevent white to develop.} 14. Qe2 Qe7 {Doubling the rook on the e file, freeing the other rook and making place for the e knight} 15. h3 {Weak move, 15. Ng4 was not in black's plan, for I do not want to open the f file for white's rook, which would be aiming at f7 supported by the annoying white LSB .} Nc6 {To prepare black's further move.} 16. Nc3 {Menacing d5 and developping, white's developpement can be considered as finished.} Nd4 {To exchange white's LSB (I've recently heard that, if you have fianchetoed one bishop, you wan to exchange the other one).} 17. Qd1 Nxb3 {The most anoying white piece is over.} 18. axb3 b6 {White has strong attacking possibilities toward the queenside} 19. Re1 {Good move, white has to contest the control of the e file.} Qd7 {Menacing 20. ... d4} 20. Qf3 {The queen goes back to it's previous spot to pin the d5 pawn to the rook} c6 {protecting both a and d pawns} 21. d4 {Blocking black's pawn advance} Rae8 {Now that the queen's wing is secured, back to the central open file.} 22. Na4 {To liberate the c pawn.} Qc7 {Now, it's time to free the DSB, and for that, the f knight needs a proper place.} 23. c4 dxc4 {Not much choice} 24. bxc4 Nd7 {Black's attack is ready to be launched.} 25. Rad1 {White attacks on the center. He's now gaining field.} Re6e4 {A strong menace on d4 } 26. c5 {White attaks on black's flank...} Bxd4 {... and black on the center, dangerously} 27. cxb6 {Exchanging a pawn, before black takes it for nothing.} axb6 28. Nc3 {Very good move, black has no choice.} Bxc3 29. bxc3 {In his last attack, black won only a pawn butlosed the fianchetoed bishop the dangerous position for white is still the same.  Black has a better position but white resists very well.} Re4e6 {Black want's to reorganise his army for the next assault.} 30. g3 {I'm not sure about this move...} Ne5 {The next assault begins.} 31. Qf4 b5 {Menacing 32. ... Nc4} 32. Qd4 {Blunder.} Nf3+ {White loses his queen, the game is lost.} 33. Kf1 Nxd4 34. cxd4 Qb7 35. Rda1 Ra8 36. Rac1 Ra2 37. Re2 Rxe2 38. Kxe2 b4 39. Kd3 Qb5+ {}
