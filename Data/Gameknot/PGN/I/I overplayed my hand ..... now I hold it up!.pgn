1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is the second instance where I thought I had a decent mating attack going against my opponent.  I intended to go right for the jugular here which is fairly rare for jstevens1!  However, in doing so, I overlooked a tactical shot.  I thought I could get out of it but then a knight move from my opponent gave me grim confirmation that I would remain a piece light.  Again, after that I waved the white flag.  So how did this happen?  Well read on.

Nf3 {3. Nf3 - a standard move preventing Glenda from hopping on her broomstick and flying to h4.} g5 4. d4 Bg7 {4. ..... Bg7 - fairly standard here, develops a piece and bolsters a weakened kingside position should Henry choose to go there later on.} 5. h4 h6 6. Nc3 {6. Nc3 - development.} d6 7. Bb5+ Bd7 8. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {8. .... Nxd7 - In order to get another piece into play I decided to recapture after the trade off of light square bishops with my knight.} 9. Qd3 c6 10. hxg5 hxg5 11. Rxh8 Bxh8 {11. .... Bxh8 - after the rook trade, Fou Lenoir is a little off-side - this will prove costly to me later on.} 12. e5 {12. e5! - threatening Qh7 forking Fou Lenoir and my knight on g8.  Henry prevents this by moving to f8.  This square will prove to be an unfortunate one as he gets caught up in the tactics later on.} Kf8 13. exd6 g4 {13. .... g4 - a square clearance .......} 14. Ng1 Qh4+ {14..... Qh4+ - ..... for Glenda!  This is not where Glenda usually resides, sadly this unfamiliar territory proves to be her undoing later on.} 15. Kf1 f3 16. gxf3 gxf3 17. Nxf3 {17. Nxf3 - I sacrifice a pawn to denude the WK and launch a direct mating attack.  Unfortunately Glenda needs a little assistance in order to do this.} Qh3+ 18. Kf2 Ngf6 {18. .... Ngf6 - and so I bring a knight into play.} 19. Bf4 Ng4+ {19. ..... Ng4+ - voila!} 20. Kg1 Bf6 {20. ...... Bf6 - threatening to come into h4 but here comes the tactical shot.} 21. Ne5 {21. Ne5 - first up a discovered attack.} Qxd3 22. Nxd7+ {22. Nxd7+ - as per my earlier note, the piece-winning combo is on due to the unfortunate placement of Henry.} Kg7 {22. ..... Kg7 - hmm, maybe I can trap the knight on d7.} 23. cxd3 Bxd4+ {23. ...... Bxd4+ - first I get a pawn back.} 24. Kg2 Rd8 {24. ...... Rd8 - the knight is trapped, but .....} 25. Kf3 f5 {25. .... f5 - my passer on f7 moves up two squares to defend it and the d7 knight is still trapped, but .....} 26. Ne2 {26. Ne2 - ... a white knight move seals my fate.  Fou Lenoir will be exchanged off and I will remain a piece down.  As I said in the intro, time to write this game off as I have no counterplay whatsoever.  I think I had better look at some tactical puzzles to try and get my rating back into the 1800s!  Joanne}
