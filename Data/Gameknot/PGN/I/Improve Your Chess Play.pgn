1. e4 {Ratings are USCF} c5 {The Sicilian Defense is a heavy theory opening. 1-Most players, especially those who are in the club level, should NOT study openings heavily. The more important rule that it is almost always better to acquire understanding of chess than to get the theoretical knowledge. With theory, you are getting one position memorized. With understanding, you get a better thought process that will get you hundreds of better moves in your chess play. So *Thought process is more important than theoretical knowledge by a huge amount, at least for the club players trying to improve.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. f3 {It's a less theoretical variation of the maroczy bind. Using the first tip, you can know that when studying openings, most players do not need a very deep opening knowledge. Instead, they should get a general understanding of the plan for both sides. Of course it depends on the opening, and heres the next tip. 2-Improving club players should NOT use highly complicated openings that require heavy theoretical knowledge. If an opening requires you to study book for many hours, it is the wrong choice. You should be able to find right moves after a general understanding. } Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Bg7 9. Be3 {3-A very common misconception is the "steady chess improvement". One of the most important things I learned from an experienced chess master from a tournament was that chess improvement happens suddenly and not steadily. Fischer once said "One day, I just got good". Basically, if you study chess correctly by improving thinking, you won't get immediate improvement, but you will get a sudden bursts after long periods of time. So don't expect to improve by a few points each week or something. You will get a sudden noticable improvement.} O-O 10. Qd2 Be6 {Little diversion. 10...a5 is the main theoretical idea.} 11. Rc1 Qa5 12. Be2 Rfc8 {4-If your results don't improve, you are not. It simply means that if you have gotton better, you MUST notice the improvement by concrete results in your playing. If you have not gotton better quality of play or consistently get better results, then your study of chess is wrong and you should change it. Many club players at plateaus read hundreds of chess books, but don't improve. They need to change the study, and then improve. Instead, they just keep finding more books to read, and are disappointed when they don't get better. A good chess book many people have praised is the book "Silman's reassess your chess". Personally, I love this book, and it has improved my results greatly. Yet there are players 1200uscf reading this book. Of course they have no improvement from it since it is way too advanced, but there are a lot of things they learn. But if the book does not help you get better results, then it is not right for you at the time.} 13. b3 a6 14. a4 Nd7 15. O-O Nc5 16. Bd1 Qb4 {Black has played the opening and early midgame very well, and already has a slight edge. The white bind is useless, since all the dark squares are horribly weak.} 17. Nd5 {Bailing out into a worse endgame, but white cracks under the pressure. } Qxd2 18. Bxd2 Bxd5 19. exd5 {?White makes a bad move, and it loses. However, black needs to play accurately, and I messed this position up, drawing.} Bd4+ 20. Kh1 Nd3 21. Be2 Nxc1 {After a long endgame, white managed to draw after I messed up tactically. As a final note, I should say that the most important thiing to avoid if you want to improve is the useless information and chess thoery that does not improve your results. For example, a lot of people study theoretical endgames. I have looked at only 7 theoretical endgame positions(Theses are special, since they are of utmost importance and can actually occur in practive) and only 3 have happened in my games. Many of my games go to the endgame as well. So many theoretical positions never happen.  If you use these tips, I have a guarantee that it will help you improve.}
