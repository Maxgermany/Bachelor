1. e4 {Hi everyone!  My first post-Xmas annotation and what a way to start with a win!  I am playing in a mini-tournament with people in my own rating bracket which is a real test of whether that 1700  rating belongs to me or not.  Actually I have got off to a reasonable start, winning 2 games and drawing one.  Those wins pushed my rating above the 1750 mark for the first time in my chess career.  Here is the latter of the two.  } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 {4. ........... d6 - after a standard Ruy Lopez I decide to reinforce my e5 pawn.  A drawback of this move is that white can still play Bxc6 inflicting a queenside pawn bust-up - although on the upside I will have the bishop pair.} 5. O-O Bd7 {5. ......... Bd7 - develops a piece and breaks the pin.} 6. c3 Nge7 7. d4 {7. d4 - a necessary pawn break in this opening.} Ng6 8. Be3 Be7 {8. ....... Be7 - Fou Lenoir emerges from his dorter and enables me to tuck Henry up next move.} 9. Nbd2 O-O 10. Re1 h6 11. Bc2 {11. Bc2 - white takes me out of the database at this point.  I play what seems a reasonable move, Bf6, reinforcing e5 and putting some pressure on d4 which over the next few moves will begin to tell on white.} Bf6 12. Nf1 Bg4 13. h3 {13. h3? - a natural move but this allows an exchange on f3 - normally not a good idea but here it is very appropriate as white is about to drop a pawn!} Bxf3 14. Qxf3 exd4 15. cxd4 Nxd4 16. Bxd4 Bxd4 {16. ......... Bxd4 - After a plethora of exchanges white is now a pawn down.  White now backs up his b pawn with Rab1.} 17. Rab1 Qf6 18. Nh2 Qxf3 19. Nxf3 Bf6 {19. ......... Bxf6 - Fou Lenoir retreats to f6 to dodge the enemy steed's attack but maintains pressure on the b2 square.} 20. Re2 Rfe8 21. Kf1 Kf8 {21. ..... Kf8 - both kings move towards the centre to prepare for the coming endgame.} 22. b4 b5 23. Bb3 c5 24. Bd5 Ra7 {24. .......... Ra7 - over the last few moves I decided to advance my queenside pawn majority.  I did allow white's lsb to nest himself in a dominant position, but my move Ra7 dodges the enemy bishop's attack and prevents and invasion of that same bishop onto b7.} 25. bxc5 dxc5 26. Rc2 Be7 27. a3 Nf4 28. Bc6 Rd8 29. e5 Rc7 {29. .......... Rc7 - after some manoeuvering over the last few moves I try and eject the enemy bishop out of my camp.} 30. Be4 Ne6 31. Rd2 Rcd7 {31. ........ Rdc7 - not wishing to relinquish control of the d file I decide to double rooks on it.} 32. Ke1 Ng5 {32. .......... Ng5 - a lot of wood is about to disappear from the board over the next few moves.} 33. Rbd1 Rd7xd2 34. Nxd2 Nxe4 35. Nxe4 Rxd1+ 36. Kxd1 c4 {36. .......... c4 - pushes my c pawn one square closer to Glendadom and opens up a line of attack onto the white a pawn isolani.  That pawn cannot be defended, white's best try here is to play a4 attempting to break up my connected queenside pawns, but ......} 37. Nd6 {37. Nd6?? - let me tell you something!  If you are a pawn down in an endgame and you VOLUNTARILY exchange down into a pure K & P endgame, let me tell you three things, it is SUICIDE, SUICIDE, SUICIDE!  This proves to be so because you are many times more likely to fall into a zugzwang (your turn to move but whatever move you play worsens your position i.e. losing material or allowing your opponent to checkmate you) than if you have another piece on the board.  Now here is how, you, with the material advantage, can exploit such play.} Bxd6 38. exd6 Ke8 39. Kc2 Kd7 40. Kc3 Kxd6 {40. .......... Kxd6 - Henry has his fav. prawn on toast for brekkies on the battlefield.  That is white's first casualty resulting out of his 37th move.} 41. Kd4 Kc6 42. a4 Kb6 {42. ......... Kb6 - Henry spies second helpings on a4 so he makes for that square!} 43. Kc3 Ka5 44. axb5 axb5 {44. ......... axb5 - I am happy with this exchange as I now have 2 connected passers.  Henry looks down to b1 and c1 and thinks "Not long now" - Boy, isn't he a happy man!} 45. h4 g5 46. hxg5 hxg5 47. g4 f6 {47. .......... f6 - one little pawn push puts my opponent one step closer to the Zugzwang} 48. f3 Ka4 {48. .......... Ka4 - there it is!  White has now completely run out of pawn moves and his king must now give ground, he can only go backwards if he wishes to halt those pawns.  I am not to be denied though!} 49. Kb2 b4 50. Ka2 c3 {50. ......... c3 - closer and closer.} 51. Kb1 b3 52. Kc1 Ka3 {52. .......... Ka3 - closing in.} 53. Kb1 c2+ {53. ........ c2  - I set up a couple of conditional moves before turning into my pit.  The white king has only 2 legal moves, a1 and c1.  If a1 then Glenda will appear dealing instant death on c1.  If Kc1 then Henry moves to a2 and then the white king has only 1 legal move, d2.  He can take the c2 pawn if he wants to, but there is no stopping that b pawn!  I wake up the next morning to a white flag from my opponent and a 1760 rating!  Marvelous!}
