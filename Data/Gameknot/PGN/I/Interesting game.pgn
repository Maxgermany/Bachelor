Rc2 b6 19. Bb4 Qd5 20. Rfc1 a5 21. Bc3 Rac8 22. Bf1 e5 23. Bc4 Qd7 {If white takes the pawn at e5, black wins it back with 24. ... Qxd2 25. Rxd2 Rxd2 26. Bxd2 Bxe5 and black doesn't have a double pawn anymore so d5 is better.} 24. d5 b5 25. Bxa5 bxc4 26. Bxd8 Rxd8 27. bxc4 {Now white has got a connected free-pawn in the centre} Bg4 28. Rb1 {There the rook is more active.} Kg7 29. Qe1 Rc8 30. Rb6 h5 31. Qb1 h4 {If white takes the pawn the king isn't so safe anymore and white has got 2 weak pawns.} 32. Rb7 {There the rook is strong because he makes the king a little bit less active.} Qf5 {There the queen is better than at another square it can go because it can attack the king the easiest from there.} 33. Qf1 {This is to defend the king.} Bg5 {This will help black winning too like you will see.} 34. Rc3 Bh3 {Here the bishop makes the kings less active.} 35. Qe2 hxg3 36. fxg3 {White can also take with the h-pawn but then the h-line is difficult to defend so the king is weaker.} Rxc4 {I find this the most interesting move of the game, black wins by this move.} 37. Qxc4 {If white takes with the rook he loses by 37. ... Bxe3  38. Qxe3 Qf1#.} Qf3 {From there the queen attacks g2 and the king can't move anymore.} 38.
