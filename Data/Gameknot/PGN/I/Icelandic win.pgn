[Opening "Scandinavian (B01), Icelandic gambit"]

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 {The Icelandic gambit. Inferior, but against a well prepared player. } 3. c4 {The "bad" move. } e6 4. dxe6 Bxe6 {The thematic position. } 5. b3 {Correct, but not enough to stop black. } Bb4 {Avoidin d4. Of course, h6 is a refutation, } 6. Nc3 {but white prefers to develop. } Qe7 {The hidden threat.} 7. Be2 {Of course, or Bxc4. } Nc6 {Thinking in Nd4, pressing e2. } 8. Nf3 {Stopping it and developing.} O-O-O {Castling into the fire. } 9. O-O {Castling into safety. } h6 {Unsure about how to proceed, I stopped Ng5. } 10. h3 {Probably unsure about d4, white returned the tempo. } g5 {If I castled queenside, is in order to press on white's kingside. } 11. Qc2 {I feared Bb2, since my black diag is weak, but after Rh-g8, there is less danger. } Qd7 {This is a good move, since threats Bf5. White can stop it, but...} 12. Nh2 {white chooses to retreat, and probably thinking about Ng4, exchanging some pieces and stopping the pressure. A great mistake. } Nd4 {The bishop on e2 is half-threatened after BxNc3. } 13. Qd3 {Mistake, much better was Qd1, and accept to exchange the bishop. } Bf5 {Deadly. } 14. Bg4 {Intelligent escape, but not enough. } Nxg4 {The white queen is lost. } 15. Qg3 {Bd6 does the trick, but I was already looking for...} Bxc3 {And white has to defend Ne2+ forking K and Q. } 16. Qxg4 {Last try. } Bxg4 17. dxc3 {I have two pieces threatened, but...} Ne2+ 18. Kh1 Bxh3 {The final shot. I can easily sac this bishop, since gxh3, Qc6+. If f3 (forced to defend the king), Ng3+ forking the rook. White, sensibly, resigned. }
