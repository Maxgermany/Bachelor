[Opening "Nimzo-Indian (E33), classical, Milner-Barry (Zurich) variation"]

1. d4 {Here is an interesting miniature I played on the ICC.  Time control G-5.} Nf6 {My standard response to the queen pawn openings.  I have played the Nimzo-Bogo systems for the past 5 years and find they are very solid and can provide interesting kingside attacking chances.} 2. c4 {Heading straight for the main lines, many players who want to avoid theory will try the Tromp, the Torre, the London, or even 2. Nc3 aiming for a Veresov or a gambit with 3. e4!?.} e6 {Implementing the light-squared strategy in the center and preparing to develop the bishop to b4.} 3. Nc3 {Supporting the e4-push which forces black to respond in the center immediately with, ...d5, ...c5, or my favorite...} Bb4 {Bb4.  Heading straight for the Nimzo-Indian where black counts on his pieces to control the center and also on rapid development.} 4. Qc2 {The classical variation of the Nimzo.  There are nine different strategies that white can adopt against the Nimzo and my opponent chooses the most popular.} Nc6 {It's no secret that my pet line against the classical is a little known variation known as the Zurich.  Rapid development coupled with an immediate threat to the d-pawn which white has temporarily abandoned.} 5. Nf3 {Probably the most sound reply.  White keeps up his development and keeps the c1-h6 diagonal for his dark-squared bishop.} d6 {With this move it's clear that black wants to swap the dark-squared bishop for the knight and try to arrange an ...e5 break to free the other bishop and gain some space in the center.} 6. a3 {Immediately forcing the swap.} Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 {Avoiding any pawn weaknesses, but temporarily leaving e4 in black's control.} a5 {This is the move I forgot when I played this line agains GM Varushan Akobian in a Seattle Simul.  In that game I played the immediate ...Ne4 and ...f5 and Var eventually took over the center and won around move 42.} 8. Bg5 {A solid an aggressive continuation.  I decide to hit the bishop.} h6 9. Bxf6 {Not quite the best move as this helps black develop and brings the queen into position to assist in an ...e5 break.} Qxf6 10. Rc1 {This is also a bit odd as e3 is the theoretical recommendation, bringing the other bishop into play and preparing to castle.} Bd7 {Simple development.  0-0 is also fine.} 11. e3 {Keeping control of the d4-square.  11. e4 would allow black easy equality after 11...e5; 12. d5 Nd4.} O-O {Castling before the central break ...e5.} 12. Bd3 {Be2 is better as there really isnt a target on the kingside after ...h6.  White will also many times play e4 to stop ...f5, when the bishop on d3 is poor.} e5 {Black should be fine here.  The light-squared bishop has scope and Black has a clear plan to play on the kingside with ...Bg4 followed by ...Ne7-g6 and at some point ...f5.  White has good queenside play, chances should be pretty equal.} 13. d5 {13. de Nxe5; 14. Nxe5 dxe5; 15. 0-0 Rfe8 should be about equal as well.} Ne7 {Rerouting the knight to the kingside via g6.} 14. e4 {The first real mistake that white has made.  Now the knight on e7 is heading to f4.  14. 0-0 would have maintained the balance.} Ng6 {Black has the initiative and white needs to drum something up on the queenside to fight back.} 15. O-O {15. c5 looks better and more consistent with the white piece deployment.} Nf4 {White doesn't sense the danger here and instead of playing the mandatory Nf1, starts his queenside play too late.  Note that 15. g3 Bh3! gives Black a tremendous game as the capture of the knight would spell the beginning of the end for the White king.} 16. b4 {Loses at once to the sacrifice...} Nxg2 {Now white has to play Nd2 to keep the f3 square under control, even though he is still lost.} 17. Kxg2 {Mate it four!  Take a minute to see if you can find it.} Bh3+ 18. Kg3 Qf4+ 19. Kxh3 Qxf3+ 20. Kh4 g5# {Thanks to my opponent for a good and instructive game.}
