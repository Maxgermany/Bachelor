[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Kmoch variation"]

1. e4 {The young Glaswegian makes a radical first move.} Nf6 {I expect him to go for the "4 move checkmate" as there has been a lot of talk about it lately. The clever shimmy from the pony stops his queen making this move.} 2. e5 {I've seen this one before. The young Tim has gone in for a dubious and half hearted attack on my wee poor pony.} Nd5 {Any other move here would have led to him eating me with his queen. I expect him to move something else to put me back under pressure again.} 3. Bc4 {Et voila. There isn't a lot I can do to move the horse from a danger into an attack, also, it would leave me open at the back.} e6 {Shore up the defence with a cheeky "take me - take you" confrontation. Will he now move his queen?} 4. f4 {No, but I like the building move. A diagnal line of pawns is a strong line of pawns. He's obviously learnt valuable lessons from not carrying out the John Barnes 4-2-2-2.} Nxf4 {Now, if I was a betting man, I'd say he'll move that pawn to threaten my pony again....} 5. Qg4 {Well suck me sideways! I have to have a decent think about this one. How do I stop him from eating my pony? Keep in mind a wrong move could be the end of the game in this position...} g5 {What do you think of that then Campbel? I think that is near on genius. Not Michael Jackson "he-hee touch kids" genius, but genius none-the-less. What you gonna do now?}
