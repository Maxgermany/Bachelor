1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 {queen's gambit accepted. let the white proove his gambit.} 3. e4 c5 4. Be3 {not a good move. more femiliar is 4. d5,} cxd4 5. Qxd4 Qxd4 6. Bxd4 Nc6 7. Bc3 b5 {black is left with an extra pawn. white has gained no advantage for that pawn.} 8. a3 e5 9. Nd2 Nf6 {all black has to do is to keep his pressure in the center. that pressure and the c pawn will win the match...} 10. Ngf3 Bb7 {keep pressing the e pawn.} 11. Nxe5 {white helps black to change pieces. I dont think its good for white.} Nxe5 12. Bxe5 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bxe4 14. f3 Bf5 {the white king is in the center and there are only pieces on the board. with the extra pawn it should be enough for black.} 15. g4 {better is 15. Be2 and 0-0 afterwards. it is not good to chase something you will never get (the bishop)...} Be6 16. h3 O-O-O {the d file is a must for black in order to attack white's king.} 17. Rd1 Bd5 {f3 is weak. black will exchange rooks after Bf8 will move.} 18. b3 Bxa3 {white is doomed. the b4 square is crucial...} 19. bxc4 Bxf3 20. Rxd8+ Rxd8 21. Rh2 Re8 {no place to hide now. the bishop or the rook are lost.} 22. Kf2 Bb7 23. Bxg7 Bc5+ 24. Kg3 Bd6+ {the end...}
