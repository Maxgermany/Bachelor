1. e4 {Going for my standard opening, alot of mistakes made on both sides, any other views?} b6 2. Nf3 {still going} d6 3. Bb5+ {ussually this would be Bc4 but I through in the check to see if I could screw up his pawn structure...} c6 4. Bc4 {now i realise it might have been a bad move, but it stops the castle queen side with the pawns way forward} e6 5. Nc3 {I have not seen this formation so I keep to my opening} h6 6. a3 {didnt want a pin on the knight if he pushed the d pawn, also makes space for the bishop} b5 7. Ba2 {handy space....} Nf6 8. d3 {covering the pawn} Be7 9. d4 {decided to push it further to keep his pawns at bay} O-O 10. Be3 {planning the queen side castle} a5 11. e5 {i was trying to open up the game a bit} Nfd7 12. O-O {decided to go king side} d5 13. Ne2 {opening c3 for the pawn} Ba6 14. c3 {getting the structure right as i see a closed down game} a4 15. Bb1 {Getting the bishop more active} f5 16. g3 {trying to stop the pawn pushon f file} c5 17. Ba2 {?! have no idee what I was thinking here} c4 18. h4 {Here i was making space for both nights behind my pawns, trying to stop his pawn push and get some more room} Re8 19. Nf4 {Here i was still looking at knights to h2 and h3} Qb6 20. Ng6 {saw there was an outpost for the knight on g6, always dangerous and an iritation to the other playere} Bd8 21. Bb1 {here i was thinking of getting the bishop more active again as my lines were closed down} Nf8 22. h5 {defending the knight, i knew the pawn would be harder to defend and if i was black i would take the exchange here} Nbd7 23. Nfh4 {getting more active pieces} Bxh4 24. Nxh4 {I did not want to playgxh4, this would open the g file and maybe cause me trouble} Nh7 25. f4 {Locking down the position and blocking Khg5} Ndf8 26. Bc2 {thinking of bishop d1 and then plaing it up the board} Bc8 27. Kf2 {opening the back rank} Qd8 28. Rh1 {thats why} Qd7 29. Qf3 {pushing the queen forward} Qf7 30. Rag1 {getting the ducks in a row for the push} Re7 31. Ke1 {trying to get rex out of the way} Bd7 32. g4 {starting to look for trouble} Qe8 33. gxf5 {Here i kenw I would pick up some free pawns, i was also eyeing to push the pawn and trade bishop for knight h7....} exf5 34. Nxf5 {+1} Bxf5 35. Bxf5 {exchange, this might have been a bad move, bishops in a semi open game agains knights.....} Rf7 36. Bxh7+ {So i traded, bad bishop for good knight....} Nxh7 37. Qxd5 {picking up stranglers, oponent did not see b5 was defended by his queen?} Rb8 38. Rg3 {trying to het the battering ram started} Kh8 {think I Kf8 might have been better} 39. Rhg1 {linning up, thinking Qg2 - but this would mean losing a queen for a rook..... stil looking} Rd8 40. Qe4 {stil looking} Nf6 41. Qf3 {Well played by him, using the pinned piece} Nd5 42. Rg3g4 {I was thinking Qg3 with the rooks infront, or after the exchange g1, i was hoping to trade, as this was a bad trade for him, he is down and exchanging a piece that was defending good for a blocked in bishop....} Nxe3 43. Qxe3 {glad he traded} Rb8 {?? did not understand this move} 44. Rg1g3 {linning up opening g1 and 2} Rbb7 45. Qe4 {Here I was not sure how to proceed, went on a 3 day boat cruise and when I returned i figured it out} Qc8 46. e6 {Presurring his rook} Rfe7 47. f5 {defending} Qf8 48. Rg4g6 {pushing up the board to defend the f6 hole.... not that it was an immediate threat} Kh7 {this was a bad move} 49. f6 {I had calculated gxf6, Rook g8+, wins} Rxe6 {He must have seen it too, here i calculated some more and saw i was stil in a good position, and the initial plan was still on even though my queen was pinned to the king...} 50. Rg6xg7+ {Double check leaves the queen semi safe} Kh8 51. Rg7g8+ {I saw i could trade 2 rooks for a queen and win his rook with check} Qxg8 52. Rxg8+ {queen is still hanging} Kxg8 53. Qxe6+ {with check...} Rf7 {Here i thought about chasing the king around but realised that pushing the d pawn would be more important, my oponent could only play Kf8 to avoid losing his rook} 54. d5 {Here my oponent retired from the game even though i thought there was still a lot of work to be done to finnish.}
