1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bg4 5. h3 Bh5 6. g4 Bg6 7. Nbd2 {My first mistake. Now, black can spread a powerful attack with B4, threatening Nc2+. I can parry it with Bd3, losing a pawn... and the game's coherence. } Ne4 {Black doesn't see it, plays this unforced move (better was e6, if not Nb4 as said).} 8. c3 {Mistake corrected. } e5 {Sacs a pawn...} 9. dxe5 Qe7 {...with this idea behind. } 10. Qb3 {I don't care about NxN, KxN, so to join the Rs... and Nxe5 is not possible yet for black, so the "point" behind Qe7 has not came to anywhere. My move threats two pawns (Nc6 won't be defended after Qxb7, so the pawn is not poisoned). (quick quiz) Can you see how to defend both pawns? } O-O-O {Only move that defends both. Now I have to prove my ability to switch target from the kingside to the queenside. } 11. Bb5 {Threatening BxN, disrupting his pawns. Black can't use B or N to defend. Which would be Black's best  and natural move, here?} Na5 {Not this. Natural move, but it happens that from here, black's fate is almost inevitable. Due to the sac and the Qe7 (bad) idea, Bdsb is trapped, and so is Rh8, while white has it very easy to penetrate on black's white squares, due to the poor position of Bg6. Note that, normally, this B is very powerful, but here he is just targeting nothing (I can't play Rb1, ok, that's all!). Nec5 instead, Qa3, Na6, and after Q's exchange, black can take a breath. Or NxN, KxN, d4, threatening dxc3+ or dxe3+... } 12. Qa4 {Only move not to lose the N is Nc4, but NxN, dxN, Qxc4...} b6 {But now it's a piece of cake. } 13. b4 {Ba6+ is always there.} c6 {? Nb7 was better, though allowing qxa7.} 14. Ba6+ Kb8 {Now, e6+ is there. } 15. bxa5 {black can slow me with b5...} Nc5 {...but this seems to recover the piece. But for... (can you find the correct combination?)} 16. e6+ {The key is f6 is weak, and if I can take it with check, I would have tempo to free my lsb. } Ka8 {Better for black would have been Rd6, which allows NxB...} 17. Qxc6+ Nb7 {Forced. Can you see how to proceed with the attack? Which is white's most direct way to make a threat?} 18. Bc7 {If you thought about Ne5, you were probably right, too. This shields b7 from the protection of the BQ, so mate is treatened. Only one: } Rb8 19. Bxb8 {The BQ remains the only supporter of b7, and no tempo is lost because black has nothing better than retake. } Kxb8 20. axb6 {Again, if you answered Ne5, you were right. But this is crushing, too. Note that black can't propose the Q's exchange (which would lighten the pressure). Not now. } axb6 {Against any other move, bxa7+ doesn't look appealing. Would you play Qxb6?} 21. Ne5 {Finally! Much more threatening. } fxe6 22. Nd7+ {...and the key is the N blocks - again - Q's defence of b7. } Ka7 23. Qxb7# {A light play in the opening lead to disaster in few-than-expected moves. I hope I didn't misassessed the position too much! (Capablanca is still scratching his eyes: no endgame! He will rest in peace, for once :-D)}
