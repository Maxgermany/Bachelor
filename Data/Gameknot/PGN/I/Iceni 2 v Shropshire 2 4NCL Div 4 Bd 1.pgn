1. d4 {Someone reminded me it was a while since I did an annotation.} Nf6 {So I thought I'd do one.} 2. Bf4 {My opponent plays The London System - very fashionable at the moment.} d6 {I was prepared for it - I had seen a few of his games.} 3. e3 {I'm not convinced it is that good.} Nbd7 {I threaten e7-e5} 4. Nf3 {So he stops that, but rules out an attacking formation with Be2 and h2-h4-h5, which I had seen him play in one of his games. I am not sure it is any good, but decided to avoid it just in case.} g6 {now that is ruled out I can safely fianchetto.} 5. Be2 {He continues to develop.} Bg7 {So do I.} 6. h3 {He prepares a retreat for his bishop. It is quite usual in this variation.} O-O {I castle.} 7. O-O {So does he.} Qe8 {I threaten e7-e5 again.} 8. c3 {After the game I glanced at a book on this opening which thought that c4 was better here, as the Nf3 may have to retreat to d2, and so the Nb1 needs to develop at c3.} e5 {I carry on with my plan.} 9. Bh2 {He retreats.} Ne4 {Given the comment in the last note, maybe this is inaccurate too, as it allows an exchange of knights. Qe7 is more usual, but I didn't know that at the time.} 10. Nbd2 {He develops and challenges my knight.} d5 {Maybe over-ambitious? What do you think dear reader? Previously only Nxd2 had been played, resulting in draws. Fritz seems to prefer Nxd2.} 11. Nxe4 {He takes.} dxe4 {I take back.} 12. Nd2 {Knight drops back attacking the pawn. Now I figured I need not protect the pawn, as if he takes I have e5xd4 discovering an attack on his knight. Fritz seemed to like Qe7 here, at first, but I thought that wasted a move, if he exchanged on e5, so I played another developing move.} Nb6 {Making way for my Bc8 to get into the game. Given time, Fritz eventually settled on this move too.} 13. Nc4 {This move was a surprise to me - but I am not sure it is that good.} Be6 {This seems the natural developing move, although Fritz seems to prefer exchanging on d4.} 14. Nxb6 {So he exchanged. 14. Nxe5 loses the knight to f6 15. Ng4 h5 and the knight has run out of squares.} axb6 {Clearly the best way of recapturing, threatening to take on a2 in some variations.} 15. Qc2 {This more or less puts paid to any ideas of taking on a2. If I take with the rook he exchanges rooks and then traps my bishop with b2-b3, and if I take with the bishop b2-b3 immediately.} f5 {Protecting my pawn on e4.} 16. b3 {Definitely ruling out any capture on a2! } Bf7 {I maintain the tension on e5. Fritz seems to prefer exchanging on d4.} 17. Rad1 {Now that the rook is no longer needed on a1.} g5 {This is probably a mistake by me. I was dreaming of a king's side attack! Fritz again likes exchanging on d4.} 18. Bxe5 {He initiates a series of exchanges to get his rook to the 7th rank.} Bxe5 {I take,} 19. dxe5 {He takes back.} Qxe5 {I take again.} 20. Rd7 {He gets the rook to the 7th rank. "What of it?" I thought. "I can always drive the rook back with Be6 or Be8." Which one is better dear reader and why?} Be6 {This is what I played. I overlooked his reply. Having said that, Fritz actually prefers Be6 and thinks it is still level.} 21. Bc4 {This is what I missed.} Bxc4 {So I took.} 22. bxc4 {He takes back.} Qc5 {I think this is a mistake. I should challenge his rook on the 7th rank. I was being over-ambitious again, and nearly paid the price!} 23. Qe2 {Protecting the pawn and threatening a king side penetration.} f4 {Another mistake! Over-ambitious again! At the risk of repeating myself, his rook on the 7th really had to be challenged.     } 24. Qh5 {It was only now that I realized that I was losing a pawn. Still - not the end of the game.} Qf5 {This is more or less forced.} 25. Rd5 {And now my g pawn will drop.} Qf6 {Not Qg6?? Rxg5 and my queen goes.} 26. Qxg5+ {Fritz prefers taking with the rook.} Qxg5 {I need to get those queens off!} 27. Rxg5+ {He takes back.} Kh8 {Of course, not Kf7? 28. Rf5!} 28. exf4 {Fritz prefers Re5.} Rxf4 {I take back.} 29. Rd1 {He indirectly protects a2, as if I take on a2, he had Rd8 mate.} h6 {But can't I just attack his rook first? Fritz prefers 29...e3} 30. Rg4 {He more or less forces the exchange of rooks.} Rxg4 {So I take.} 31. hxg4 {He takes back.} Rxa2 {And the a2 pawn drops.} 32. Rd7 {Fritz prefers Rd8+. We`looked at that move together after the game, but I was still drawing it...} Rc2 {I go after his pawns.} 33. Rxc7 Rxc3 34. Rxb7 Rxc4 35. Rxb6 {I think the exchange of all the queen-side pawns helps me draw it. It is well-known that one can draw a pawn down in a rook ending, if played carefully. I manage to draw this!} Kg7 36. Re6 Rc1+ 37. Kh2 Rc2 38. Kg3 Re2 {Making it hard for him to win my e pawn without losing his f pawn.} 39. f3 {I had originally planned to play 39..... e4xf3  40. Rxe2 fxe2 here, but a quick look at the endgame database shows that is still drawn. Fortunately the ending is still drawn.} e3 40. Kf4 Rxg2 41. Rxe3 Ra2 42. Kf5 Kf7 43. Re5 Ra6 44. f4 Rf6+ 45. Ke4 Ra6 46. Rb5 Kf6 47. Rf5+ Kg6 48. Rd5 Kf6 49. g5+ hxg5 50. Rxg5 Ra4+ 51. Kf3 Ra1 {Draw agreed. So I managed to draw a game I should have lost. Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system, to let me know how I am getting on. Until next time dear reader!}
