1. d4 c6 2. c3 d5 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. Bxb8 {Surprising move but playable.} Rxb8 5. e3 Nf6 6. Nf3 e6 7. Bd3 Bg4 8. h3 Bh5 9. g4 Bg6 10. Bxg6 hxg6 11. O-O {the white position looks already lost...} Rxh3 12. Ng5 Rh4 13. Nd2 Qc7 14. Ndf3 {an other critical error by whites} Rxg4+ 15. Kh1 Bd6 16. Rg1 Rxg1+ 17. Kxg1 Ke7 {h2  is my target.} 18. Rc1 Rh8 19. c4 {bh2  was programmed, if c4 is played.} Bh2+ 20. Nxh2 Qxh2+ 21. Kf1 Ne4 22. Nxe4 {I had forgotten that K} dxe4 23. d5 {d5 shows that fransschwanen wanted to gain tempo in the center... but with 2 pawns up, how could black lose the game. Nevertheless I played really bad moves after. My intention here was to exchange the queens.} Qh1+ 24. Ke2 Qxd1+ {I should have played Qf3 .} 25. Rxd1 exd5 {I eventually take care of d5.} 26. cxd5 cxd5 27. Rxd5 f5 {I feel confortable with those pawns on the K's side. But we play about 25 more moves.} 28. b4 Rd8 29. Rc5 Rd7 30. a4 {white's K can not fight on Q's side.} b6 31. Rc4 Kf6 32. Rc6+ Kg5 {I can not understand why white do not resign.} 33. Rc8 Kg4 34. Rg8 g5 35. Rh8 Rc7 36. Rh7 a5 37. bxa5 bxa5 38. Kd2 f4 39. exf4 gxf4 40. Rh1 Kf3 41. Rh5 Ra7 42. Rf5 g6 43. Re5 Kxf2 44. Rxe4 g5 45. Re2+ Kf3 46. Re5 g4 47. Ke1 g3 48. Kf1 g2+ {there was probably some better ways to play the position, I could not find them.} 49. Kg1 {fransschwanen certainly saw this mate coming, I must thank him to let me play it until the last move.} Rh7 50. Rxa5 {White take that a pawn but this is useless } Rh1# {}
