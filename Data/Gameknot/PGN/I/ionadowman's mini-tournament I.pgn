[Opening "Sicilian (B29), Nimzovich-Rubinstein; Rubinstein counter-gambit"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e5 {Sicilian, Nimzovich-Rubinstein; Rubinstein counter-gambit (he says, as if he knew this opening at the time)} Nd5 4. c3 Nc6 5. d4 {I was guided by the opening database a bit here, to be honest this isn't the sort of opening I'm entirely comfortable with.} cxd4 6. Bc4 {Forces the knight away to the edge where it has less influence on the centre.} Nb6 7. Bb3 {Although I now have to use another move to put the bishop somewhere safe, although it's still in a nice position.} dxc3 {In the meantime black gets to eat more pawns.} 8. Nxc3 {Recaptures the pawn and develops at the same time. I'm always a bit wary of having one pawn on a solo mission in enemy territory as it feels a bit like over-extending, but it came good in this game.} e6 9. Ne4 {This seems like a good place for the knight, potential holes in f6 and d6 to keep in mind and the square g5 is now dominated by white.} d5 {I actually thought this was a mistake and black forgot about the en passant here, but the computer analysis apparently has no problem with this.} 10. exd6 e.p. {Only reply that makes sense as far as I can see, white is now back level and has a pretty good position, with a passed pawn cramping black.} Bd7 {I'm not sure this was the best move, the bishop has nowhere really to go from d7, and this relieves the pressure on the d6 pawn a bit.} 11. Bf4 {At the time of playing this move I'd been reading a bit of Aron Nimzowitch's 'My System' where he was talking about overprotection, insisting that strong points should be protected more times than they are defended. Apparently this 'good deed' reaps rewards just in itself, so I thought I'd test out this theory here - d6 is a strong point and a thorn in black's side, so white defends it a 3rd time even though it is only attacked once.} Nd5 12. Bxd5 {The bishops diagonal isn't particularly promising with the black pawns at e6 and f7, so this exchange seemed like a good idea. With the black pawn then isolated at d5 I was reasonably confident it wouldn't last there.} exd5 {Black should have played a5+ first, protecting the d5 pawn.} 13. Qxd5 {White wins a pawn, and has a very attacking position.} g6 {This is the move that really sealed the defeat for black, it leaves all sorts of interesting tactics open to white.} 14. Be5 {Attacking the undefended rook, but if the rook tries to hide by ..Rg8, Nf6+ and blacks only legal reply is ..Qxf6, and Bxf6 wins the queen. I was a bit unsure about how to deal with the reply ..Nb4, although fortunately for me black didn't try that.} Qa5+ {Black decides to cut his losses and force the queens off the board. This loses a rook but relieves the immediate pressure on the king.} 15. Qxa5 {Only sensible move.} Nxa5 16. Bxh8 {And white wins a rook. The name of the game now is "don't do anything stupid", this game should be a straightforward win.} O-O-O 17. Bc3 {Brings the bishop back to base, and forces black to do something about the a5 knight that is under attack.} Nc4 18. O-O-O {Protects the b2 pawn, d6 pawn, reduces the exposure of the king and activates a rook.} Bf5 19. Rhe1 Bxe4 20. Rxe4 {I'm not sure exchanging pieces is the best thing for black to be doing whilst a rook and a pawn down, but by removing the e4 knight he can get rid of the annoying d6 pawn.} Nxd6 21. Red4 {Simply trying to exchange off pieces here, the knight is now pinned, and if ..Re8, Rxd6 ..Bxd6, Rxd6.} Bh6+ {This doesn't really accomplish anything other than losing a tempo, since the king is happy to move and the bishop uses a second move to return to f8.} 22. Kb1 Bf8 23. Bb4 {With the knight pinned and under a triple attack, something is going to have to be exchanged off.} Kc7 24. Bxd6+ {The computer analysis doesn't really like this and prefers Ne5, but it's one of those situations where there's a "technically accurate" best way of doing something, and a "not so accurate but easy for a human" way of doing something, the latter being less risky.} Bxd6 25. Ng5 {Well the bishop is now pinned so the knight is heading for f7 where it can force further exchanges.} Rd7 26. Nxf7 {I guess ..Rd7 was to defend the f7 pawn but it doesn't work since once the rook moves off the d-file the bishop gets taken.} Rxf7 27. Rd4xd6 Rxf2 28. Rd6d7+ Kb6 29. Rd1d2 {Black either has to exchange off his rook or retreat and let white start eating pawns, so he quite sensibly resigned here.}
