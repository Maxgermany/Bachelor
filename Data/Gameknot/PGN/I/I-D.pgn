1. e4 {This game is more than 40 years old. It shows me (at the black side) in a international cc match Germany-Italy  juniors (under 25years). enjoy} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 {the Traxler Variation in the Two Night Defense. Highly complicated and sharp} 5. Bxf7+ {White avoid 5.Nxf7 Bxf2+ 6.Kf1 Qe7 7.Nxf8, which is deep analyzed and ended very offen in perpetual check} Ke7 6. Bd5 d6 {new idea, allow the white knight again to jump to f7} 7. h3 {good or bad ??!  Better is c3 or d4 for developing.} Qf8 {!! an idea of the slav grandmaster Krc} 8. O-O Bd7 9. c3 Re8 10. d4 {a better way for white is 10.Bxc6 Bxc6 11.d3 h6 12.Nf3 g5 13.Be3 =} exd4 11. Bxc6 Bxc6 12. cxd4 Bb6 13. Nc3 h6 14. e5 {not good - 14.d5 Bd7 Kf3 Kd8 and black has enough compensation for the pawn.} hxg5 15. Bxg5 Kd8 16. Re1 dxe5 {double edge move , but the Bb6 needs a free diagonal.} 17. dxe5+ Kc8 18. exf6 gxf6 {!! black looses a second pawn, but white kingside is wide open.} 19. Rxe8+ Qxe8 20. Bxf6 Rg8 21. Nd5 {blunder but what else can white play - g4 !?} Qe4 {follewed by a black blunder, too - Kb8 wins simple } 22. Ne7+ Kb8 23. Nxc6+ Qxc6 24. Qd8+ {??? white blackout .  Bg5!! followed by h4 is the plan, f.e.  Qb5 25.Bc1 a5!} Rxd8 25. Bxd8 Qc2 26. Bh4 Qxb2 27. Re1 c5 {game over - at the end a lucky punch.}
