1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5 {Into the Elephant or Latvian Gambit} 3. Nc3 {Gambit declined with a counter punching queen's knight move} d4 {The punch forward to d4 but ...Kd5 leaves an adwanced protected knight threatening Kc7 if the Queen is deployed to early in development.} 4. Nd5 Bg4 {Realising the danger on c7 trying to develop with threat pinning knight to Queen} 5. h3 {Reverse of the spanish opening that started accept or decline the knight capture for the bishop} Bxf3 6. Qxf3 {Accepted but white develops the Queen rather than the weakening pawn position created in the reverse in the spanish line for black.} a6 {Creating breathing space for the rook on c8 to prevent the threatend fork from Kc3} 7. Bc4 {Threat of Kc3 opening up capture by Queen or Bishop on f7} Nf6 {Prevents the double attack on the f7 pawn. Over exchange of knights and Queens.} 8. Nxf6+ Qxf6 9. Qxf6 gxf6 {Knight and Queen exchange complete white has the slight advantage of the doubled pawns and weakend kingside defence of black. } 10. O-O b5 11. Bd5 {Maintaining the threat on the Queenside Rook.} c6 12. Be6 {Blunder should have been Bb3} fxe6 {Moves the doubled pawns over toward the centre when facing an attack from rooks and bishop shoring up the defences as a result of white's blunder.} 13. d3 {Halts the d pawn's advance and also allows completion of development freeing the bishop.} f5 {Not really threatening fxe4 but the threat of f4 throttling the newly liberated bishop's usefulness} 14. exf5 exf5 15. Bg5 {Threat of trapping the bishop removed with the exchange and advance beyond the pawn's defensive line.} Be7 {White's bishop can either retreat and re-enter the trap of capture forcing the king to stay in the centre of the board after capturing for the exchange.} 16. Bxe7 Kxe7 17. Rae1 {With black's king now unable to castle putting the threat on the 3 file preparing to open it up} Kd6 {Removing the pin and protecting pawn on e5. Also prevents e4 18. dxe4 fx4 19. Rxe4+} 18. g3 h5 19. c3 {Better would have been c4 either forcing the e.p. capture or bxc4} c5 20. cxd4 {Better should have bee c4 to try and close up the game to try and make something out of the material disadvantage rather than allowing an open file as a result of cxd4} cxd4 21. Re2 {Error should have been Rc1 to command the newlt opened file} Nc6 22. Rc1 Rac8 23. Ree1 {The threat was Kb4 to threaten Kxd4 to open up the d file for advance, better would have been a3} Nb4 24. Red1 Nxa2 {Kxc3 25. Rxc3 Rxc1+ is still probably better as the d pawn has advancement potential, however, this still has matching winning threats with an exchange either on c8 or c1 of rooks} 25. Rxc8 Rxc8 26. Kg2 Rc2 27. g4 fxg4 28. h4 {Trying to stop the king's side advance but the threat is already coming from the queen's side and it is too late.} a5 29. Kg3 Rxb2 {After the advance of a5 now creating two pass pawn on the a and b files.} 30. f3 gxf3 {Isolating the king and all of whites pawns} 31. Kxf3 b4 32. Rf1 Rd2 33. Ke4 b3 34.

Kg6 Rxd3 39. h5 {Rearguard action advancing the last remaining pawn but too late to be of any use} Rg3+ 40. Kf5 d3 41. h6 d2 {The battle to queen was always blacks to win } 42. h7 d1=Q 43. h8=Q {White queens but Qf3 ends it all} Qf3# {}
