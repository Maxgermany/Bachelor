1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I am getting to the end of Master Chrisobee's Amor Vincit Omnia (Love conquers all) mini-tournament and I was paired with an Expert called Ningshih.  It was a very closed game and Ningshi had a big task breaking through it.  She did manage to breach the walls slightly by launching a combo which won a pawn.  This directly resulted in a single rook and pawn ending.  However, Henry and my rook managed to hold the fort and Ningshih could not make any further headway whatsoever and accepted my draw offer on move 54.  After my difficult game and loss against Coach Ion, I was really thrilled to have this boost and give my fellow Walk The Walkers hope for the future.  So, how did this happen?  Here is the gameknot analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17636006&rnd=0.8220917387966657} c5 {1. ..... c5 - Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ {3. Bb5+ - rather than play d4 I decided to do something different and play the Nimzowich-Rossolimo Attack.  Interesting that Coach Ion likens my play to Nimzo and Tigran Petrosian!} Bd7 4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {4. ........ Qxd7 - bishop trade.} 5. O-O Nc6 6. c3 Nf6 7. d3 {7. d3 - necessary to bolster my e4 pawn - at least this move opens up Fou Lenoir's diagonal.} e6 8. Qe2 Be7 9. Rd1 {9. Rd1 - I decided to put my rook on the same file as the Wicked Witch of the West.  This may form the foundations of tactical combos against her later on.} O-O 10. Bg5 b5 11. Nbd2 {11. Nbd2 - time to clear the decks!} h6 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 {12. ..... Bxf6 - B for N trade.} 13. Rac1 Rab8 14. Rcb1 b4 15. c4 {15. c4 - this is the start of the Joblock.  Nearly all my pawns bar one will end up on white squares.} a5 16. Nf1 Qe7 17. Ne3 b3 18. a3 {18. a3 - stage 2.} a4 19. Rdc1 Bd4 20. Nd1 Rba8 21. Nc3 Bxc3 22. Rxc3 {22. Rxc3 - at least black's strong bishop has been traded for one of my knights but black still has a spatial advantage.} Qf6 23. Qd2 g5 24. h3 e5 25. Rcc1 {25. Rcc1 - not a lot doing but at least I can make moves which do not compromise my position.  It is more a case of wait and see.} Kg7 26. Kf1 Qg6 27. g4 Rfh8 28. Kg2 {28. Kg2 - Henry moves to this square to prepare for a WR to come to h1 to counter the threat on the h column.} f6 29. Rch1 h5 30. Rbg1 {30. Rbg1 - again lining up a WR on the same file as the Witch.} Nd8 31. Kf1 Kf7 32. Ke1 Ne6 33. Kd1 Nf4 {33. ..... Nf4 - so a black knight is placed on a very active square and passivitis sets into the white camp.  But can black inflict anything worse on me?  Remember, if you can move just one piece to one square to avoid losing material or making any other concession - your opponent cannot put you in a zugzwang!} 34. Kc1 {34.  Kc1 - I do feel that Henry is a little safer on the queenside than on the kingside with the pawn formation blocked up.  Glenda, my knight and the rooks are keeping a close eye on the d3 pawn and the kingside.} hxg4 35. hxg4 {35. hxg4 - at last, black initiates a pawn trade which opens up the h file and she now prepares to double rooks on it.} Rh7 36. Rxh7+ Qxh7 37. Qd1 Rh8 {37. ...... Rh8 - so black does not double rooks on it but there are two major pieces on it.  Maybe it would have been better if the Witch had gone behind the rook but that would have taken a lot of messing about on black's part.  Nonetheless, I feel this order will be crucial to my kingside defense later on.} 38. Kd2 Kf8 39. Qf1 Ke7 {39. ..... Qe7 - black does a lot of manouevering though - with her king!} 40. Ke3 Kd7 41. Qe1 Qh3 {41. ..... Qh3 - at last black declares her hand.  A nasty pin on my f3 knight is on the cards.  Glenda now offers her life for that of the Witch.} 42. Qf1 Qxf1 43. Rxf1 {43. Rxf1 - one of the invaders is traded off, but there is still a black rook to reckon with.} Rh3 44. Rd1 Ng2+ 45. Ke2 Ke6 {45. ........ Ke6 - black moves her king to get me into a material losing zugzwang.  I can do nothing about this but, looking at the board and the pawn formations gives rise to the thought that I can afford to lose a pawn here, despite my opponent being 300+ rating points above me (remember that my 1950 rating is inflated!) - I simply dare to believe that as the BK may not be able to penetrate into my position, Henry and my rook will be able to handle the black rook and prevent any further damage.} 46. Rg1 Nf4+ 47. Ke3 Nxd3 48. Kxd3 Rxf3+ 49. Ke2 {49. Ke2 - Henry immediately puts the question to the black rook which, incredibly, has only one square to go to - h3!} Rh3 50. Rd1 {50. Rd1 - at least this rook momentarily puts pressure on d6 and ties the BK down to defending it.  However, black can attack my g4 pawn because I cannot afford to defend it with f3?? because this will allow a rook skewer on h2 winning the critical b2 pawn.} Kd7 51. Kd2 Rh4 52. Rg1 {52. Rg1 - nothing else, but at least Henry has the squares e2 and d2 to oscillate from.} Rh2 53. Ke2 Rh4 54. Kd2 {54. Kd2 - DRAW OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE!  My opponent sees that there is no way through the Joblock and, rather than take a risk like Freddy did in my draw game and hand me back a pawn to try and penetrate down the kingside bit the bullet.  While I would rather have been up and at em' like Master Blaster Ineedaname there is something really satisfying about preventing my Expert opponent from beating me - that is a victory in itself.  At the moment I am carrying on Master Freddy's work - challenges between players with huge rating differentials.  Eventually these challenges, although they may seem disheartening at first to have to deal with the heavy material losses and/or copping Old Matey, standards in play of these lower rated players will gradually and eventually improve until the walkers become runners!
