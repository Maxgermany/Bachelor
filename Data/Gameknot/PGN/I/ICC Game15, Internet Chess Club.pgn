1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 {This game was played on the Internet Chess Club with a time control of 15 minutes.} e6 3. Nf3 {This game appears to be dead even until both sides blundered.  My conclusion is that the opening is probably drawish until somebody makes a mistake, which might give black good practical winning chances if he knows the opening well.} Bb4+ 4. Bd2 Qe7 5. a3 Bxd2+ 6. Nbxd2 {The computer prefers Qxd2 instead, maybe because it likes the knight on c3. } b6 {The Houdini chess engine thinks that d6 is preferable.  I can only assume that it wants to keep its options open as to play b6 or not. } 7. e3 {Playing 7. e4 is preferable, but only by a slight amount. } Bb7 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O d6 10. b4 Nbd7 11. Nb3 {The knight is not going to be very useful on queenside, but it is not clear what kind of plan white should be playing.  } a5 {Playing c5 is a little better.  } 12. Qc2 axb4 13. axb4 Ne4 {This move is consistent with Black's plan.  The computer thinks that 13. .... e5 is minuscule better. } 14. Bd3 {White could have played 14. Nfd2 and now if 14. ... Nxd2  15. Nxd2 brings the other knight back to a more useful square of d2.  If instead  14. ... f5, then 15. Bf3 is fine for white an allows him to try to exploit the pin. } f5 15. Rxa8 {Again, 15. Nfd2 is minuscule better.  } Rxa8 16. Ra1 Rxa1+ 17. Nxa1 {The knight being temporarily out of play is going to help black a little.} g5 {Again this is consistent with Black's plan, but the computer slightly prefers 17. ... Qe8 so that if 18. Qa2 and 19. Qa7, black can play 19. ... Qa8. } 18. Nd2 {Only by the slimmest of margins does the computer think that Qa2 is better. } Ndf6 19. f3 { } Nxd2 20. Qxd2 g4 21. f4 {Gives black a tiny edge.  21. fxg4 fxg4 (21. ... Nxg4 is not very effective after 22. h3)  22. Nb3 Qe8 23. b5 Be4 24. Bxe4 Nxe4 25. Qc2 } Ne4 {21... Be4 22. Bf1 Qe8 23. Qa2 g3 (apparently not worried about sacrificing the pawn) 24. h3 h5 but I don't see much coming out of this position. } 22. Qa2 Qh4 {22... Qd8 23. Qa7 Qa8 } 23. Qc2 {Blunder. 23. g3 and now  Nxg3  fails to 24. Qf2 } g3 {Also a blunder, overlooking the mating attack.  23... Qe1+ 24. Bf1 Qxe3+ 25. Kh1 Nf2+ } 24. h3 Nf2 {Hoping to sacrifice the knight on h3.} 25. d5 {White needed to play  25. Bf1 Be4 26. Qa2 Kg7 27. Nb3 } Qf6 {After a long think, the Houdini chess engine agrees with this move, which has the idea of 26. Nb3 Nxd3  27. Qxd3 Qb2 with a strong advantage... 28. Nd2 Qc1+ (Qxb4 is only even after 29. dxe6 ) 29. Nf1 Qe1  30. Qd2 Qxd2 31. Nxd2 exd5 winning a pawn.} 26. dxe6 {Disastrous.  26. Nb3 Nxd3 27. Qxd3 Qb2 28. Nd2 Qc1+ 29. Nf1 Qe1 30. Qd2 Qxd2 31. Nxd2 exd5 32. cxd5 Bxd5 } Qxa1+ {White resigns }
