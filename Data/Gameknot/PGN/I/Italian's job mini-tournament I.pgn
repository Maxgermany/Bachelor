1. d4 {Good start, horrible end. Please, any comment is welcome as how it went so bad for me (white)} d5 2. c4 {I try to use the Queen's gambit as my main opening for the moment.} dxc4 3. Nf3 c6 4. e3 b5 5. a4 {Trying to get back my advantage while keeping an influence in the center} a6 6. axb5 cxb5 7. b3 Be6 8. bxc4 bxc4 9. Qa4+ Nd7 10. Bxc4 Bxc4 11. Qxc4 {Both our queen sides are open but I think I have a better development and a better pawn structure than black at this moment} a5 12. Ng5 {Trying to check mate... Who wouldn't see that? I should have developped another piece instead or castling} e6 13. Ne4 {Now I lose a tempo} Be7 {Luckily he is not developed and wants to castle} 14. Nbc3 {Getting more power into play but I probably should have tried to put some pressure on the queen side instead} Ngf6 15. O-O O-O 16. f3 {In all honesty, I don't know what is the meaning of this move and it's going to give me the worst pawn structure in all the game a little later.} Qc8 17. Qb5 Bb4 18. Ba3 Bxa3 19. Rxa3 Qb8 20. Rxa5 {Black is free to choose which one he wants to exchange. I should have tried to keep the initiative.} Qxb5 21. Rxb5 Rfc8 22. Nxf6+ {Completely unnecessary, it doesn't even open the castle...} Nxf6 23. Ne4 {I was thinking this move would help me open the f file for my Rook, but it destroyed my pawn chain...} Nxe4 24. fxe4 Ra3 25. Rb7 {Trying to find a way out} f6 26. Rb6 Re8 27. d5 exd5 28. exd5 {2 isolated pawns to protect...} Raxe3 {only 1 now...} 29. d6 {Rd1 was probably better...} Rd3 30. Rfb1 Kf7 31. Rb6b7+ {Desperately trying to draw...} Ke6 32. Rb1b6 Kf5 33. d7 Rd8 34. Rb6b5+ Kg6 35. Kf2 Rd3xd7 36. Rxd7 Rxd7 {Now the end game...} 37. g4 {Trying to get some 'space'} h6 {but he is coming slowly trying to keep a compact structure} 38. h3 Rd2+ 39. Kf3 Rd3+ 40. Kf2 {Blunder. I can't understand why I didn't go Kg2.....} Rxh3 {Now I'm definitely done} 41. Rb4 Rh4 42. Kg3 Rh1 43. Rf4 Ra1 44. Kh4 Ra5 45. Rc4 Rg5 46. Rb4 h5 47. Rf4 hxg4 48. Rxg4 Rxg4+ 49. Kxg4 f5+ 50. Kf4 {I won't get the stalemate and he will queen...} Kf6 51. Kf3 g5 52. Kg3 f4+ {Should I play Kg4 here?} 53. Kf3 Kf5 54. Kf2 g4 55. Kg2 f3+ 56. Kf2 Kf4 57. Kf1 g3 58. Kg1 f2+ 59. Kf1 Kg4 60.
