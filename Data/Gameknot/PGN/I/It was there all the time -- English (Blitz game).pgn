1. c4 g6 2. Nc3 Bg7 3. Nf3 d6 4. g3 Bg4 {Not the sort of thing you see every day, but hardly a bad move. Other playble ideas are 4. ...e5, ...Nc6, ...Nf6, and even ...c5.} 5. Bg2 Nf6 6. d3 Nc6 7. O-O Qd7 8. Bd2 Bh3 9. Rb1 Bxg2 10. Kxg2 h5 11. h4 Qf5 {Until the text move things were pretty boring, giving very indication the middle game would be one of careful maneuvering, the cautious incremental accumulation of tiny advantages, and probably a peaceful draw somewhere about the 45th move. But Black has now rather needlessly exposed his Queen, and now I start thinking about how best to exploit the miscue.} 12. b4 {But first things first: I want d4 for my KN, so the N on c6 has to be kicked.} a6 13. b5 Ne5 {I'm not ready yet: after all, Black's Queen still has the the diagonal to retreat along, and g4 to play to. But I "had a whisper in my ghost" that if I was careful (i.e. as long as I didn't lose in the process of trying to be so clever) I might be able to make Black pay for that Queen sortie.} 14. Bf4 {Casting the die. Now if Black plays 14. ...Nf3, then trapping the Queen will be difficult. But I keep a tenable position in spite of the fact I have a N on c3 that's trying to hang.} Neg4 {Well, well. Now I'm really calculating. Black's Queen still has plenty of escape squares, ugly though they be; but I'm now adding possibilities of a more comprehensive attack to my plans. All those Black pieces on my K-side are just cars in a rush-hour traffic jam: no danger at the moment.} 15. bxa6 Rxa6 16. Rb5 Qe6 17. Ng5 {Turns out g5 is the better square for my Knight.} Qc8 {Giving up, finally. So Black's early Queen sortie turns out to be a bad idea: and that's what I was trying to prove.} 18. Qb3 Rb6 {This move drops a pawn after 19. Rb6 cb6  20. Qb6; but I have something a wee bit nastier in mind.} 19. c5 {! -- Black's ancient weakness at f7 is suddenly exposed.} Rxb5 20. Qxf7+ Kd7 21. Nxb5 {This is not an automatic win for White; the position is actually unclear, although White is a pawn to the good.} Bh6 {?? -- Black misses his chance. The correct move was 21. ...Qg8! breaking White's attack. That's the resource that makes the position unclear. Now, however, all the mist disappears as White mops up briskly.} 22. Qe6+ Kd8 23. Nf7+ {Wins both Queen and Rook now, so ... Black resigns.}
