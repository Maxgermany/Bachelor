1. d4 {Trying out a new moment as either way i'll win the game.} d5 {So far it is quite a normal game.} 2. Bf4 {I bring my bishop out.} Nc6 {And black his knight.} 3. Nc3 {I also bring my knight out.} Nf6 {And so does black.} 4. Nf3 {It seems like a 4 knights game apart from the bishop being in the game.} Bg4 {I threaten to put opponent in a bad opponent.} 5. Ne5 {I move my knight out of the way.} Nxe5 {I except the exchange.} 6. Bxe5 {I take with my bishop because if I took with my pawn his pawn would be able to advance and threaten my knight.} Ne4 {I also go for a swap off.} 7. Nxe4 {This time it is me as white excepting the exchange.} dxe4 {The only way I can take his knight- it seems as if my opponent is in the better position.} 8. h3 {I attempt to scare his bishop away.} Be6 {There isn't much I could have done.} 9. Qd2 {I move my queen out of the way so that I can castle in my next move.} Qd7 {I am copying white.} 10. O-O-O {I castle.} O-O-O {And again...} 11. e3 {I push my pawn to release my bishop.} Bxa2 {I, without thinking take the pawn.} 12. b3 {Just what I had hoped for.} f6 {I push pawn to attack his bishop.} 13. Bg3 {Hardly a better move.} Bxb3 {My best option.} 14. cxb3 {I capture his bishop but it leaves me in a bad position.} a6 {I push pawn for maybe in the future.} 15. Bc4 {I put myself in a good position (I think).} Qc6 {My bishop is pinned.} 16. d5 {I try and force his queen back.} Qc5 {I just push my queen forward.} 17. h4 {I start advancing my end pawn.} b5 {I have his bishop trapped at the cost of my position.} 18. Qa2 {Not much i can do to save my bishop.} bxc4 {I take feeling better.} 19. bxc4 {I take back} e5 {I push my pawn two forward forgetting about n.p} 20. dxe6 e.p. {That is exactly what I do but I get rid of his double pawns.} Rxd1+ {I take the oppurtunity of a swap off as I am in a better position.} 21. Rxd1 {My best move.} g5 {I push my pawn in attempt for more exchanges.} 22. Qxa6+ {I am back in the lead and I believe there is a checkmate on the way.} Kb8 {Only option.} 23. Rd8# {And there you go- another game proving that I play better as white. I made quite a few mistakes in this game but that it is mostly because I was trying to play as fast as I can.}
