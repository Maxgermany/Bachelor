1. h4 {Well, I've annotate this game yet. But htis time there's a li'l surprise! yes, because i ask to a chess friend of mine to comment this game. and i wanna do it. and that chess friend of mine is CYRANO!he's italian like me so i'll try to translate as well as i can his comments.} d5 2. b3 e5 3. Bb2 f6 4. e3 c5 5. Nc3 {I don't comment white's opening, it's made by weak moves.} Ne7 {easier was 5...Nc6} 6. Qe2 a6 {i don't understand the sense of this move. 6...Nbc6 was better.} 7. O-O-O Nbc6 8. f3 b6 {white still make incoherent moves. he want to attack on Queen side. so there were no need to move b6. 8...Be6 was better.} 9. e4 {This is a bad mistake. } d4 10. Nb1 {Nb1 hinds the king} Bd7 {this is not a good move for 2 reasons. 1.Be6 was better 2.Nb4 threatens a2#in the next move.} 11. g4 {white hasn't real targets on king side and he should care of king's health...} h6 {There were no need of a defencing move.} 12. d3 a5 13. Bh3 Be6 {Black ignores 13...Nb4 and if 14.a3 Na2  15. Kd2 a4 with a violent attack.} 14. Rf1 Qd7 {too quit move. black could move a4 or Nb4.} 15. h5 g6 {black still decide to not attack white's king.} 16. Nd2 Nb4 {black move Nb4 finally....but it's too late! b5 was better} 17. Kb1 O-O-O {noooo rook was good in a1} 18. hxg6 Nxg6 19. Qg2 Be7 20. Nc4 Bxc4 {a nervous move that dissolves the advantage. Kb7 was better} 21. dxc4 Kb8 22. g5 {22.a3 Nc6 23. Nc6 Ne2! with the idea Cc1-d3.} Qd6 23. gxf6 Bxf6 24. Qxg6 d3 25. c3 {a suicide move. Rc1 was so better...} d2 26. Rd1 Qd3+ 27. Ka1 Nc2+ 28. Kb1 {in this moment black could make a good mate combo: 28 ...Na3  29. Ka1 Qb1  30. R:b1 Nc2#.} Ne3+ {Like u can see i've just sketch the analysis. Bye.}
