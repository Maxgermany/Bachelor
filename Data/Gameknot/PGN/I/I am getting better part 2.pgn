1. e4 {This game shows how much chess you can learn in a couple months of practice and hard work. This game ends in 28 moves with checkmate. enjoy!} e5 {Back to Back king pawn pushes.} 2. Nf3 {I bring out my knight to f3 as usual.} Nc6 {black knight to c6} 3. c3 {An opening I have been doing alot of lately and it works for me. This move opens up for the queen to check the king and also prepares for a pawn push to either d3 or d4 but usually d4.} d5 {Black moves pawn to d5 which throws me off for a second because I am not used to seeing that move.} 4. d3 {I respond with pawn to d3} dxe4 {Black takes on e4} 5. dxe4 {I retake on d4} Qxd1+ {This is not my favorite transaction but I did not mind this time. Queen takes Queen} 6. Kxd1 {King takes Queen.} Bg4 {Black bishop to g4 attacking my knight.} 7. Bb5 {I do the same on the opposite side.} Bxf3+ {Black bishop takes my knight.} 8. gxf3 {I retake.} a6 {Black moves pawn to a6 attacking my bishop.} 9. Bxc6+ {I take his knight as well keeping it even.} bxc6 {Black retakes. } 10. Nd2 {I prepare to develope my pieces by moving knight to d2.} Bc5 {Black does the same by moving bishop to c5 attacking pawn on f2.} 11. Rg1 {I move rook to g1 attacking his pawn on g7} Bxf2 {Black takes my pawn.} 12. Rxg7 {I take black pawn.} Rd8 {Black moves rook to d8 pinning my knight.} 13. Kc2 {I move my king un-pinning.} Bh4 {Black moves bishop to h4 preparing to try and move my rook.} 14. Nc4 {I move my knight from the rooks path to c4 also attacking black's pawn on e5.} Bf6 {Black moves bishop to f6 attacking my rook.} 15. Rg2 {I move rook g2 which I thought was better than g1} Ne7 {Black moves knight to e7} 16. Bh6 {I free my rook at the same time blocking black's king from moving to f8.} c5 {Not sure why black took the time for this move. I think to move the knight here on c6. Yes} 17. f4 {My plan here is to move pawn to f4 and take on e5. Putting rook on e2 maybe pinning the knight or checking the king at some point.} Nc6 {But black was one step ahead of me and defends e5 by putting a knight on c6.} 18. fxe5 {I take pawn anyways. on e5} Nxe5 {Black's knight retakes. I figure either to defend my knight on c4 or take black's knight.} 19. b3 {I choose defend.} Nxc4 {Black trades off knights.} 20. bxc4 {Pawn takes on c4} Be5 {Black bishop to e5 here I think to prepare and take my pawn on h2} 21. Re1 {I wanted to get a Rook on the same file as the king by moving to e1.} Kd7 {For some Reason black tries to get his king to the other side by moving king to d7.} 22. Rd1+ {I quickly check black's king.} Kc8 {Black moves king to c8} 23. Rgd2 {I move Rook to d2. I am not sure why because if we were to trade off Rooks here my pawn march would be very difficult and could lead to a draw game.} Bf6 {Black turned down the exchange and moves bishop to f6 to defend Rook on D file.} 24. Be3 {I move bishop to e3 attacking black's pawn on c5} Rhe8 {Black moves Rook to e8.} 25. Bxc5 {I take black's pawn on c5} Rxe4 {Black takes my pawn on e4 with rook.} 26. Ba7 {I move to a7 to block king from b8} Rxc4 {White continues to take my pawns.} 27. Rb1 {I move rook to b1} Bxc3 {Now white takes my pawn on c3 with his bishop. I think black is caught up with his own checkmate plans that it doesn't see the checkmate in one. Does anyone see what black is trying to do? because I don't.} 28. Rb8# {Rook to b8 and that's checkmate. Thanks for watching hope you enjoyed. }
