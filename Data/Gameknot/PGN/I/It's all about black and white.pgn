[Opening "Gruenfeld (D80), Stockholm variation"]

1. d4 {This is another game I played against Alex, a friend of mine. ( see annotated game: Nimzo Indian Defence. )} Nf6 {Sticking with his primary weapon against 1.d4, Alex plays the Indian Defence 1..Nf6.} 2. c4 g6 {This time Alex decides to play 2..g6 instead of 2..e6.} 3. Nc3 {Forcing black to make a commitment, as to wether to play the Gruenfeld, or to play 3..Bg7, allowing white to play the move e4, wich would stop the Gruenfeld.} d5 {Alex plays 3..d5, entering the Gruenfeld defence.} 4. Bg5 {The Stockholm variation. I saw Vassily Ivanchuk play this move in a game against Peter Svidler and decided to play it against Alex...} dxc4 {A bit dissapointing...I was expecting the main line 4..Ne4} 5. e3 {( 5.e4 is stronger. )} Be6 {? 5..Bg7 would have been more consistent.} 6. Bxf6 {To play d5 on the next move.} exf6 7. d5 Bf5 8. e4 {( See the note at move 5. )} Qe7 9. Qe2 Bc8 {The bishop must retreat since the square d7 is needed for the development of the knight.} 10. Qxc4 Bh6 {Since the light-squared bishop is driven back, Alex decides to try his luck with his dark-squared bishop.} 11. Nf3 {To answer 11...f5 with 12.e5} O-O 12. Bd3 Bg4 {The bishop is back! } 13. Nd4 f5 {   !} 14. h3 fxe4 15. Nxe4 Bf5 16. Ne2 Qe5 { ! Now the square e5 is a strong post for black's pieces. The black queen is aiming at pawn b2.} 17. Ne4c3 Bxd3 18. Qxd3 Nd7 {Black plans to move the knight to c5.} 19. O-O Rfe8 20. Rfe1 Nc5 21. Qc2 Rad8 22. Kf1 { !? Threatening discovered attacks at the black Queen. Also, the King moves to a light square, where it's less likely to be checked, since the black pieces seem to be moving more on the dark squares..} b6 {(If black tries to play ...Qh2, white plays Ng3.)} 23. Ng3 {(Attacking the Queen.)} Qg5 24. Nce4 Nxe4 25. Nxe4 Qe5 26. Qb3 {By now it has become clear that White controls the light squares, while black has more options on the dark squares.} Bg7 {For the second time black aims at pawn b2.} 27. Nc3 {(Again the Queen is under attack.)} Qf5 28. Rxe8+ Rxe8 29. Ne2 {White has to be aware of the move ...Qe5.  For instance, if white plays 29.Nb5?, black can win with 29...Qe5! ( Threatening 30...Qh2 and 31...Qh1 mate, but also 30...Qxb2. )} Qe5 {(Still a strong move.)} 30. Nc3 Bh6 {Alex could have gone for the draw; 30...Qh2 (threatening ..Qh1 mate) 31.Ne2 Qe5 32.Nc3 Qh2 etc., but he probably felt he had more winning chances, since the white King is more exposed to attacks.} 31. Qb5 {Notice how the white king cannot be checked, since both the black queen and the black bishop are on dark squares.} Qe7 {  ? } 32. d6 {A pawn sacrifice that leads to a nice combination!} cxd6 {Not so many options here.} 33. Nd5 { ! } Qe5 34. Nf6+ { !} Qxf6 35. Qxe8+ Kg7 36. Rb1 Qf5 {Black is trying to gain some space on the light squares and (for the first time) looking at a possible check on d3.} 37. Rd1 Bf4 38. Qe7 Qb5+ {Finally, black checks the white king, but by now there really isn't any threat anymore.} 39. Qe2 { !} Qxe2+ 40. Kxe2 Kf6 {The black king hurries to defend the pawn on d6.} 41. g3 Be5 42. f4 Bxb2 43. Rxd6+ Ke7 44. Rd3 { ! Now black is lost, since his king can't defend the Queen side. The rest of the game is not important, but I'll post the moves anyway..} Ke6 45. Kd2 Bf6 46. Kc2 h5 47. h4 a6 48. Kb3 b5 49. Kb4 Kf5 50. Ka5 Bg7 51. Kxa6 b4 52. Kb5 Bf8 53. Rb3 {And black finally resigned. Hope you enjoyed the game as much as I did...}
