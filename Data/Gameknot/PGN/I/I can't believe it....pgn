[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Lundin (Kevitz-Mikenas) defence"]

1. d4 Nc6 {Odd defence. I should have played d5, but I was sure he was well prepared to it, so I went on with my usual scheme, knowing than, in it, Nc6 is kind of a mistake. It is easier for me to play without the c5 move from black. } 2. Bf4 d6 {I can go directly to d4, here. Still, I stayed in my confort zone.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nbd2 g6 {Getting into an opening where c5 is good for black... but now impossible. } 5. e4 Bg7 6. c3 O-O {This scheme means I have to pressure on f7, knowing he can defend it, but by forcing his game into the defence it keeps me "healthy". Now, with the N in c6, all my moves into the white diagonal (Qb3 and Bc4) will meet Nb5. So, either I play b4, or I provoke Nb5 in a position that favours me. Not Bc5, but...} 7. Qb3 {...because the Q is more flexible, and if Na5, she can move and attack the N in return. } e5 {Black sacs a pawn, but there is poison in it, after Re8. So I have to play carefully.} 8. dxe5 Nh5 {Interesting. If dxe5, I'd probaby retired my dsb instead of taking the pawn. Wth the text, the simple idea is to exchange my dsb and then grab the e5 pawn. But I have a nice resource (other than g3).} 9. Bg5 {f7 is pinned. If Na5, the Q's exchange is ok to me.} Qe8 10. exd6 {We'll have both a weak, isolated central pawn. My K has time to retreat, aiming with the castled R on his weakness. Not bad. } cxd6 11. O-O-O h6 {This closes his lsb the way to h6, which uses to be a good attacking move against my K. } 12. Bh4 {Probably a mistake, Be3 was preferable, fighting for the center. I thought that if g5, hunting the B, Bg3, NxB, hxB could have provided me with a possible attack line on the h column, so it was acceptable. } Be6 {Not to hurry taking Qxb7. } 13. Bc4 Na5 {Ouch! did I forget what I said earlier? Yes. } 14. Qb4 {I lose my bishop pair... sigh!} Nxc4 15. Nxc4 {My queenside looks weak, and I smelled death. Anyway, I'll grab the central pawn, but at cost of my a2 pawn. } Qc6 {It looks good. } 16. Nxd6 {...I accept the loss of a2. And, still, I won't take b7 lightly. } a5 {Well, if you ask for it...} 17. Qb5 {Still sensing danger in taking b7.} Qc7 18. a4 Ra6 {Well, he's begging for it...} 19. Qxb7 Qxb7 20. Nxb7 Rb8 21. Nc5 {Now my N will take the lsb, smoothing the danger. I couldn't calculate too much, but by removing a B I felt somewhat safer. } Rab6 22. Nxe6 Rb6xb2 {! Ok, I kind of expected this. But there is no mate. I though I'll lose because of a5: after taking my a4, it will be hardly stoppable. But surely I won't allow his dsb to be looming on my K!} 23. Nxg7 Nf4 {Please note: Ne2#. If Re1, Nxg2, forking. So...} 24. Rd8+ {...eat this! :-D} Rxd8 25. Kxb2 Rb8+ 26. Ka3 {...defending my pawn. His a5 pawn is his only short-term possible countergame. } Kxg7 {Nxg2 looks better, but I'd had Bg3, R moves, Nh5. If he takes my N (gxh5) his pawns get very badly placed, and his Ng2 was trapped after Rg1.} 27. Bg3 {...and with this (foreseen) pin, which forces more exchanges, he gave up. I coudn't believe it! I was 1599 when the game started... and I recovered my 1600 "status" (for what it whorths) demostrating that my opp sac was unsound, or at least, badly managed. Cheers!}
