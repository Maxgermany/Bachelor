1. e4 c5 {As much as I hate to do it, I'm annotating all of my games, even the bad ones. So here's a bad one. Team match, one of four games I started against this same player (two matches) on 1/19/2009. I'm black and play the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. c3 Nf6 {White has thrown me for a loop with 3. c3. I don't have any chess library to speak of, and this move isn't in what I have. So I'm winging it with the GK DB for now. Edit: Note that now black's knight attacks the white pawn on e4, but if black captures it, say with 4. ... Nxe4?, white replies 5. Qa4+ and 6. Qxe5 and black loses his knight.} 4. Be2 g6 5. O-O Bg7 {Dragonish.} 6. d3 Nc6 7. Na3 O-O {Just developing.} 8. Nc4 b5 9. Ne3 a6 10. a3 Be6 {More developing. I should be attacking, but I'm finding nothing so far.} 11. b4 cxb4 12. axb4 Nd7 {Ah, there's a bit of a lame attack on the white pawn at c3, and a bit sneakier, pinning that pawn to the rook enabling 13. ... Nxb4.} 13. d4 Nb6 {Incoming fork. I thought 3 pawns would compensate for the piece quite nicely.} 14. d5 Bxc3 15. Rb1 Bxd5 16. exd5 Nxb4 {Black has created two passed pawns on the queenside, supported by eachother no less. Surely that's worth a bishop.} 17. Qb3 Rc8 {Oops. Black may not be able to hold onto all that he's won. Maybe those pieces are just a tad overextended.} 18. Ba3 Nb6xd5 {I think maybe 18. ... a5 might have worked out a bit better. A lot better, I think. Stick a ? on 18. ... Nbgxd5?.} 19. Nxd5 Nxd5 20. Qxd5 b4 {OK, down two pieces but up by 4 pawns, 3 of which are passed. Maybe this can still work. Except 20. Bb4? was probably not a good way to start off.} 21. Bxb4 Bxb4 22. Rxb4 a5 {OK, down two pieces but up by three pawns. Maybe this can still work?} 23. Rbb1 Rc5 24. Qd1 Qc7 25. Rc1 e6 {Fact is, I'm pretty much done for. I am hoping to trade everything off in such a way that white has to sacrifice a piece to stop the promotion. That would leave black with two pawns for a piece. One more promotion threat, one more sacrifice, and black is up a pawn. Yeah, not gonna happen, but maybe if I can threaten it, or if my opponent makes a mistake along the way, I can still get a draw, or a lucky win out of it. Maybe. Worth playing on to find out.} 26. Rxc5 Qxc5 27. Qd2 Rc8 28. h3 a4 29. Ra1 a3 {Well, traded one piece and the promotion threat is getting white's attention.} 30. Qa2 Ra8 31. Nd2 Qe5 32. Nc4 Qc5 {Looks like white isn't going to let black back into the game after all.} 33. Qb3 d5 34. Rxa3 Rxa3 35. Nxa3 e5 {Oh well.} 36. Nc2 Kg7 37. Ne3 {Yeah, I could play this on for 30 or so more moves, but two pawns against two pieces is a losing deal. I have better games to spend my time analyzing. By better, I mean games I'm not throwing away - my opponent played this game very well.}
