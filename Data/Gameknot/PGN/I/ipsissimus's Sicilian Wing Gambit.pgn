1. e4 c5 2. b4 {Sicilian Defense, Wing Gambit.  I do not like this variation because black appears to enjoy a slight advantage after taking the pawn, nor do I see how white makes up for the loss with any positional gain.} cxb4 3. d4 Nf6 4. Bd2 e6 5. Bd3 Qb6 {Usually not wise to bring the queen out early, but I figured why not?} 6. c3 bxc3 7. Nxc3 {White has five pieces in the field, black only three.} a6 {This move really boxes in my white bishop, which remains trapped until near the end of the game.} 8. Nf3 Nc6 9. Na4 {The queen must move.} Qc7 10. Nc3 Ba3 {I didn't really have anything in mind when I threw this bishop out there.  I guess I thought I might discourage white from playing Rc1, not that white would WANT to do that.} 11. Qb3 {White forcefully recommends black withdraw the bishop.} Bb4 12. d5 {This pawn push causes black considerable anguish, as the trade leaves white up a black bishop or a knight.} Bxc3 {Unless black trades the bishop first.} 13. Bxc3 exd5 14. Qb2 {White maneuvers to attack Nf6 instead.  PxPd5 seems like the better choice--the queen was guarding it against NxP.} dxe4 {Pawn fork, protected by the knight about to die for the glory of Rome.} 15. Qe2 {Black is ahead three pawns.  The white queen cannot get pinned while that pawn is in the way, but black begins dreaming of pinning the white queen.  The f knight will protect the rook on e8--several moves down the road.} O-O 16. Bxf6 {Nope, guess it won't.  Black doesn't want to break up the castle wall.  And the e pawn looks malnourished.} exf3 {Nom nom knight!} 17. Qe4 {White ignores the pawn for the thrill of a quick victory.  As if black could not see through such cheap parlor tricks.  Time to deploy the queen.  The beauty here is that white will no longer be able to castle, and the black queen can then traipse across the empty 5 rank to protect the h pawn.} Qa5+ 18. Kf1 {Kd1 might have been better, so the h rook could have egress.  White, though, has a lot of power focused across the board with both those bishops.} fxg2+ {Not really a good pawn fork, given that nothing is backing it up.  But the pawn was a goner anyway--it could make itself useful breaking up the white pawns, before the black queen deals with the threat against her sovereign.} 19. Qxg2 {White threatens mate from a new angle.} g6 {After this move black eyes the white queen again, nestled up against the king.  It would take a lot of doing, but if black could get his remaining bishop on h3, that would be fun.} 20. Be2 {This move seemed to lack purpose.} d6 {Black opens the door for the bishop.} 21. h4 {Confounded!  White brings another piece to protect h3.  The bishop plot is foiled, before it even got off the ground.  Black hunts around for another high value target (HVT), and decides Ne3+ would work--provided Pf2 was trapped.  It would require several feints with the knight, and Bf6 could cause much mischief.  But the first move is clearly the queen.} Qf5 {We should persuade white's black bishop to move.} 22. Bg5 {...but not there!  Now the knight cannot attack e3.  Black should have thought about white's response with greater care.  Kg7 would discourage Bh6--and the white queen is in no position to offer assistance.  But with a three pawn advantage black could also frighten white with even trades.} Nd4 {Black moves the knight.  Nc2 will scare the rook, but before that can occur Bg5 must be dealt with--either by getting blocked by a pawn or enticed off its diagonal.} 23. f3 {White adds queen power to the suspected threat against the white bishop.} f6 {Black feared white might move 24. Bh6, forcing Re8.} 24. Be3 {Neither rook a or bishop 3 is protected, making Nc2 a great fork.  But better yet, Be3 is right where the knight wants to be.  Black anticipates white will trade the a rook for the knight.} Nc2 25. Bc4+ {White searches for a way to stave off disaster.  While the white queen is now attacking the far flung knight, he is also under the protective fold of the black queen.} Be6 26. Bxe6+ Qxe6 {White cannot even things up with 27. QxNc2 since black will play QxBe3, but it is probably the best option here.} 27. Rc1 {Bishop and queen make for serious horse trading. } Nxe3+ {}
