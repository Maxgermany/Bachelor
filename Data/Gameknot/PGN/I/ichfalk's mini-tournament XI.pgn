1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {French defense. I have been preparing using Roman D's new training vid about a system vs the french.} 3. e5 c5 {most played here is c3.} 4. Nf3 {He suggests the Nf3 line.} Nc6 {pressure on d4.} 5. Bd3 {My fine attacker Bishop! This bishop destroys the king side in many lines.} cxd4 6. O-O h6 {Usual replys are Ngd7 planning Ng6, Qc7, Bc5.} 7. a3 {I prevent the kicking of my great white bishop. Sometimes black will reply a5 here thinking that I am planning to kick his knight, but that is not the plan. I will complete development towards the kingside where I am strongest.} Nge7 8. Re1 {Defending the e5 pawn and preparing for the queens knight journey.} Ng6 {adding pressure on e5} 9. Nbd2 Bc5 {Defending d4, but the plan here is to IGNORE the d4 pawn and play it like a gambit to gain development.} 10. Nf1 O-O 11. Ng3 Qc7 {again attacking the d5 pawn. } 12. Bxg6 fxg6 13. Qd3 Bd7 14. Qxg6 {ack! Who will defend the king??} Qd8 15. Bxh6 Qe7 16. Ng5 {And black is lost. Thank you Roman for your great lesson on the french!}
