1. d4 d5 2. h3 Nf6 3. a3 Bf5 {He brings out his pawns early I guess making it harder for my knights to advance. If he were to castle from here, it wouldn't look especially pretty, but the king will never get that  far anyway. } 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Bg5 e6 6. e3 h6 7. Bxf6 Qxf6 8. Bb5 Qg6 9. g4 Bxc2 {Advantage me! ... but I will lose it somehow...} 10. Qd2 Be4 11. Nxe4 Qxe4 12. f3 Qg6 13. Qc1 Bd6 14. Bxc6+ Ke7 {Yup, this is where I lost it. (The advantage, not the game.) Maybe I should have  taken the bishop here...but I think my king's position would  have been worse...} 15. Bxb7 Rab8 16. Ba6 Rb7 {Given the circumstances, a decent trap. It occurred to  me too late that moving the  other rook to c8 would have looked less obvious, but no use complaining since he did take the bait.   (But left me wondering all afternoon/night before he finally did so.[In retrospect this "trap" may have killed me. Don't try this at home, kiddies.])  I guess he never saw it coming.} 17. Bxb7 Qd3 {Bam! You know you in trouble now!} 18. Qd2 Bg3+ {Oh  no you di-in't put your lady in my lady's face! But I didn't come alone! I got friends!  My kingdom for a horse! He says, but his horse can't even help him! He's hopeless!} 19. Kd1 Qf1+ {Yup he runnin' for it now. All runnin' in circles around his lady lookin' silly.} 20. Kc2 Qxa1 {And I  am back in the game.} 21. Qc1 Qa2 22. Ne2 Qc4+ 23. Kd2 Bd6 24. Qxc4 dxc4 25. Rc1 Rb8 26. Bc6 Rxb2+ {I am offering draws at this point,  and being met with only mockery. But I think this game will end in a draw, and  I sir, shall have the last laugh.  ....................................................................................  wichti: well, u lost, didnÂ´t u? ....................................................................................  Nobody likes a know-it-all,  Wichti.} 27. Rc2 Rb3 28. a4 Bb4+ 29. Kc1 Ba3+ 30. Kd2 Bb4+ 31. Nc3 Rb1 32. Ke2 Rh1 33. d5 Rh2+ 34. Kd1 Rh1+ 35. Ke2 Rh2+ 36. Kd1 Rh1+ 37. Kd2 Rh2+ 38. Kc1 Rh1+ 39. Kb2 Rxh3 40. dxe6 Kxe6 41. Nd5 Bd6 42. Rxc4 f6 43. Nf4+ Bxf4 44. exf4 f5 45. gxf5+ Kxf5 46. Bd7+ Kg6 47. Rc6+ Kh7 48. Bxh3 a5 49. Bf5+ g6 50. Bxg6+ Kg7 51. f5 h5 52. Rxc7+ Kf6 53. Rc6+ Kg5 54. f4+ Kh4 55. f6 Kg4 56. f7 h4 57. f8=Q Kg3 58. Rc3+ Kg4 59. Qf5# {Yeah, I did lose it in the end, whilst enduring some merciless mockery from my opponent, who basically profited from some very sloppy moves on my part. Personally, I don't think someone who titles a game "In a mad world only the mad are sane" should be allowed to mock other people, but that's just my opinion.  I can only be comforted by the fact that my opponent was too cowardly and classless to grant me a rematch.}
