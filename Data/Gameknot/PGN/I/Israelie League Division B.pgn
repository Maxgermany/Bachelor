1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. f3 {interesting , white don't have to show black where or when the LBS will move , by the move 6. f3 !? it defends e4 pawn and avoiding black  playing Ng4 after Be3 whits move , and avoiding  unpleasant position for white , but  it  makes  now easy-er for black to attack d5 square and  that square very important in blacks game plane  in dragon Sicilian mostly openings } Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O d5 {good move , black attacking whits center by tacking advantage of white didn't move Bc4  and attacking e4 pawn , it seems that all so black given a free pawn but its not so easy , capturing the pawn will give black very hard contra play , for example : 10.Nxc6-bxc 11.exd5-cxd5 .12.Nxd5-Nxd5.13.Qxd5-Qc7!.14.Qc5-Qb8 (not!! 14.Qxa8??-Bf5! and white   losing his queen  because of amate threat on c2 and the whites queen under attack by the black rook on f8 , and  if 15.Qxf8+Kxf8 , pare rooks for queen but white stays under attack  and the black queen on c7 is stronger than arook on d1 and  h1 and where there are still pisece queen is stronger than pare rooks . the correct move is ,  12.Bd4!-Qa5.13.Kb1-Rb8.14.g4 and equal position .   } 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 12. Nxc6 Qxa2 {nice scarifies of knight ,  A mate threat on a1 and whites knight under attack on c6 , allowing white capture the e7 with check still is very bad position for white because of   its   exposed white  king .} 13. Nxe7+ Kh8 14. Qd3 { i think this move is blunder , even making an escape square for the king still doesn't help white so much because  it expose whits king even more. } Qxb2+ 15. Kd2 Be6 {whre the white knight will move?! , black threats Rad8 if 16.Nd5-Rfd8 and the white Knight is trapped because of a pin on   d- line , if 16. Ke2-Rfe8.17.Nd5-Rad8..... ,   maybe 14. c3 would help?! , but no so much either because : 15...Be6 16.Kc2-Bc2+.17.Kd3-Rad8+...., if 16.Qc2- Bb3...} 16. Be2 Rad8 {another blunder , white now loses its queen and the all game , 17.Ke1 was better but after Re8 still white in lost position  because of  18.Nd5-Rad8.19.c4-Bf5.20.Qd2-Rxd5!.21.Qxb2-Rxd1+.22.Kxd1-Bxb2... if 21.cxd5-Bc3.... and last  21.Qxd5-Rxe3+...} 17. Rdb1 {desperate try for white , black easily  blocks that try .} Qc3+ 18. Kd1 Rxd3+ 19. Bxd3 Qc7 {white resigns , because of the trapped knight on e7 that's to much to take for white , thank you i really hope you enjoyed my game . }
