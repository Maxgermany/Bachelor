1. e3 {A very pesimistic move, here is only e4 appropriate.} e5 2. Nf3 e4 {Maybe my pawn structure will not be very stable but I'll get a quick development with tempo} 3. Nd4 Nf6 {Didnt wonnt to play c5 immediately since Nb3 with d3 and c4 undermines my center very easy} 4. Nc3 Bb4 {I know this is not the best place for my bishop but I wannted to prevent 5.d3 with 5....ed3: 6.Bd3: Bc3: and a double pawn} 5. Na4 {? Iam not sure what was the idea, maybe preventing the double pawn on c line aftder playing d3} d5 6. c3 {? Oh so thats all about the previous move. One can see that white has no idea what to play not to mention a bigger plan or strategy.} Bd6 {This either brings the bishop in a good position or lurkd the night on b5} 7. c4 {Thats a logical and first realy good move from white. Taking the pawn would just allow him to develop his bishop for free 7. ... dc4: 8. Bc4:} O-O {Kings safety first} 8. Qb3 {Not so bad but the queen is not good positioned: 1. only a minor threat on d5 2. not active 3. away from his king - at least 2 precious moves} Be5 {Now the queen defends the pawn on d5} 9. Nb5 {?Again a bad move eliminating both knights by placing them on the table border} c6 {I could leave this knight there but was just too curious where the hack will he place him, aside I was planning now a pawn breakthrough.} 10. Nbc3 {Now take a look at the position: Whits development is at least bad, Bishops closed, Nights on the border, Queen hiden out of reach, king in the middle without adequate defense and no chance to castle in  at least 4 moves since Bd3 is very bad. If black breaksthrough white is in deep...trouble} d4 {Baby here I come! Taking it means 11.ed4: Be4: with pressure on f2 since blacks Knight can also move on g4 attacking f2 and h2} 11. Ne2 {? White nows the threats on f2 and complicates but unfortunately to his own damage} d3 {! This has a lot of consequences:  White can not develop his balck bishop White can not develop his white bishop White can not castle} 12. Nec3 {? Bad again, N3 would hold the position, at least for a while. Now he has again a minor threat 13. Nc5 with attack on e4 pawn.} b6 {Although the pawn doesnt matter because the name of the game is crash all the available forces against the white king, the knight on e4 would make it hard attack the king.} 13. f3 {?? This winns the game, its just the black is the one who wins! 1. diagonal e1 h4 is open 2. king has no place except d1 3. from d1 there is no way out!!!! 4. no one near to help the king, especially the white queen 5. The black white fielded bishop can  jump in one move on g4!} exf3 {A must nove since starting the action now with Ng4! would mean the white plays Ne4: and eliminates all the threats also winning a pawn} 14. gxf3 {Forced} Ng4 {!!! Who would think of that, white was more than supprised} 15. fxg4 Qh4+ {Now tha black planns are obvious} 16. Kd1 {remember ? just pne place to hide} Bxg4+ 17. Be2 Bxe2+ {Not de2: since the king could escape to soon} 18. Nxe2 dxe2+ {Now Kc2 would fail on simply Q34  checkmate} 19. Kxe2 {Now the blacks plan is simply to bring reinforcement and finish the game, the Bishop blocks the rock which c should be on e8 and d8 } Bxh2 {Moving the bishop and 1 pawn more for black} 20. Rf1 {? Bringing the wueen near the king would be better} Nd7 {There is no need to hurry and complicate something with useless queen and bishop moves. Black planns to activate both rocks. Wihite has a weak king, no castle, clodsed bishop and rock, far queen and very bad knight. Activating the rocks would winn the game} 21. Rf4 {?? } Bxf4 {the only active white piece is gonne now} 22. Qd3 {? Not taking the Bishop is very strange at least but on the other hand re8  would follow with Kd1 Qg4  Kc2  etc} Ne5 {Brings Knight in action with tempo and closes the whites escape field d3!} 23. Qe4 {?bad again but the position is hopeless anyway, at least the queen is nera the king he thinks} Qg4+ {Prevents whit going on d1,c2...} 24. Kf1 {No way out } Qd1+ {Again moves the king on open} 25. Kg2 {Only move since 25. Kf2 Ng4  26. Kg2 Q e2  27. Kg1 Qf2  28. Kh1 Qh2   or 27. Kh3 Qh2  29. Kg4: Qg3 etc} Qe2+ 26. Kh3 Qh2# {}
