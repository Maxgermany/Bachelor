[Opening "Grob's attack (A00)"]

1. g4 {What to play against this? I don't know for sure, but one thing: d5, trying to press the pawn in g4, is not the right way to proceed. Nasty tricks from white if so...} e5 2. Bg2 Nc6 3. c4 Bc5 {My favourite setup. I won't try to contest white's lsb, but play my game instead.} 4. Nc3 Nge7 {This N can't develop to f6... too bad, it was on his way to e7 anyway.} 5. d3 d6 6. h3 {...losing a precious tempo defending g4, that was what I aimed for. Now, the h4 square is free to my Q or N. } f5 7. gxf5 {To develop the lsb is ok, but 1) it leaves unguarded b7, and 2) Taking with the N is a step forward for both my Q and N way to h4.} Nxf5 8. Bxc6+ {Oooohhh, scrambling my pawns... but you'll see at what price!} bxc6 9. e4 {Now, I have to be careful. But white's position is so weak that I can play "Tal's" style. Guess what: } Bxf2+ {Can I have a ! for this one? :-)} 10. Kxf2 Qh4+ 11. Kg2 {Best, if white doesn't want to lose Rh1 to my N, forcedly.} Qg3+ 12. Kf1 {Now the eternal question: how to continue the attack?} Nh4 {Maybe this is the right one. The inmediate threat is Qg2+, winnint the R. True is white can stop it with Qd or e2.} 13. Nge2 {? Blunder. It doesn't stop Qg2+, but I want more...} O-O+ {Too nice not to play it.} 14. Nf4 {Only move. Now, I can get back my material, but even better is...} Qg2+ 15. Ke1 Nf3+ {! Simple, but beautiful. } 16. Qxf3 Qxf3 17. Rf1 Qg3+ 18. Ke2 exf4 {White has no possible counterplay, and he is -7. The game is decided.} 19. Rf3 Qg2+ 20. Rf2 Qxh3 {Making room for my white bishop.} 21. Bxf4 Bg4+ 22. Kd2 {Now, another little tactic just to finish.} Rxf4 23. Rxf4 Qh2+ 24. Ne2 Bxe2 {Best move for white is Ke3. But... my opponent resigned. sensibly. Qg3+ and he loses another exchange. Thank you for reading!}
