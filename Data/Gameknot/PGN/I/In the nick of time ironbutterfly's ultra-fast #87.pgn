1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 {Opting to keep my QB at home and defend the gambit pawn.} Bg4 {Black chooses to develop his QB outside the pawn wall.} 5. Be2 e6 6. O-O Bd6 7. Nc3 Nbd7 8. b3 {Standard developing moves so far.  With this move I confirm the decision to fianchetto the QB.} O-O 9. Bb2 Qb8 {An interesting attempt to attack h2.  Why not 9....Qc7 though, which would have connected Black's rooks?} 10. h3 {White asks the question of Black's QB and takes the h-pawn out of the firing line.  After the swap on f3 there will be no advantage to Black in playing his other Bishop to h2.} Bxf3 11. Bxf3 Qd8 {so the Q returns to base ...} 12. Rc1 {White resumes normal development} a6 {This both prepares ...b5 and discourages a future Nb5 by White} 13. Re1 Rc8 14. e4 {This break threatens to fork Black's B and N, so Black has to respond actively.} Bf4 {counter-attacking} 15. Rc2 Ne8 {Now, with Black unable to play his Rook to e8, looks a good time to open lines, so...} 16. exd5 cxd5 17. cxd5 e5 {by not retaking, Black gives up a pawn but sets White other problems.} 18. dxe5 Nxe5 19. Be2 Nf6 20. Qd4 {looks powerful but there is a sting in Black's reply} Qd6 {Now, at first glance, if 21. Qxf4, Nf3+ seems to win the Q but White can capture on f3 with his Q} 21. Qxf4 Nxd5 22. Nxd5 Rxc2 {The sting hits home.} 23. Bxe5 Qxd5 {As the dust clears, White has two minor pieces for a rook: virtually a level game.} 24. Bf3 {skewering Black's Q to his pawn on b7} Qa5 {but Black counter-attacks against White's undefended rook and a2 pawn} 25. Rd1 Qxa2 26. Qg3 {threatening mate in one} f6 27. b4 {ignoring the threat to the Be5 to threaten Bd5+, forking the Black Queen} Kh8 28. Bd6 Rfc8 29. Bc5 {splitting the rooks and bolstering the defence of f2} Qc4 30. Rd7 {threatening mate in one again} Rc1+ 31. Kh2 Rg8 {defending against the threat} 32. Bd5 {forking Q and R - surely decisive?} Qf1 {in turn threatening mate in one} 33. Qxg7+ {and Black resigned because of 33....Rxg7 34. Rd8+ Rg8 35. Rxg8#}
