1. e4 {This game started as most do when I'm playing white, the trusty old e4...} c5 {So my opponent opts for the Sicilian in response, which is also tried and tested.... } 2. Bc4 {A move i often play, it halts any immediate plans of d5 and adds early pressure onto the traditionally sensitive f7 pawn...} Nc6 3. c3 {This move is a favourite of mine, although it does impede the Q-knights development a little it bolsters my claims to the center of the board and also c2 can serve as a nice spot for the queen to conduct the battle from for a while if the need arises...} g6 {Black plans to fianchetto his bishop..} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. d3 {Opening space for my Q's Bishop and Knight to enter the game...} Nf6 {Now we are both prepared to castle I need to find a way to keep black busy for a while if I can...} 6. Be3 {So I strike out at the undefended pawn on c5...} b6 {Easily parried at the expense of limiting the black queens movement for now...} 7. a3 {I wanted to cover b4 twice so the c3 pawn could defend d4 without leaving b4 unattended...} Ng4 {My opponent decides to strike out himself but I spot a potential flaw and after some deliberation I take advantage of it....} 8. Bxf7+ {This move only works on those rare occasions where the opponent overstretches his resources without taking the appropriate cautionary steps first. In this case g5 and g4  are both vacant and are now available for occupation, had d6,d5 or e6 or e5 been played first this would never have worked out....However... } Kxf7 {.....I cause as much carnage as possible with my temporary sacrifice.....} 9. Ng5+ {The logical follow up...} Kf8 10. Qxg4 {Quickly recouping my losses and some...} Ne5 {I expected black to lash out at my queen although I was expecting d5 I noted that this move also attacked a undefended pawn so...} 11. Qe2 {I decided Qf4+ would just worsen my position so I opted for retreat...} Bf6 {I thought about my next move for some time. I really didn't want retreat all my pieces back from where they had came and admitting a minor territorial defeat, so I opted for as aggressive a move as I could think of...} 12. f4 {If the Bxg5 then I felt I could take a firm hold of the f file with my rook after castling...} Nf7 {Instead the black knight retreats...} 13. O-O {And I stick to my plan and castle, now I have a rook aimed at the black king, a Knight in a threatening position on g5 and my queen ready to leap back into the fray via the d1 h5 or e1 h4 diagonals...And the black king is denied casting privileges 3 major pieces are yet to be activated and 1 minor piece is still on his starting blocks... } Kg7 {Side stepping the rook and activating the Rook on h8....} 14. Nd2 {I decide to wake up my remaining forces and direct them toward the enemy king....} d5 {Finally black activates his remaining pieces.....} 15. e5 {Forcing the bishop to exchange and opening up the dangerous f file in the process..} Bxg5 16. fxg5 Ba6 {pinning my Queen to the d3 pawn, although Bf5 or Be6 may have been better in the circumstances....} 17. e6 Nd6 18. Bf4 {I really wanted to exchange that knight and would have had my opponent left it on d6, however...} Nf5 {This move blocks the scope of my Rook at the expense of....} 19. Be5+ {..One of his own. which also allows a nice little sequence....} Kg8 20. Bxh8 Kxh8 21. Qe5+ {A nice little tempo gain and unpinning my queen with +..} Kg8 22. g4 {Thinking back on this game I'm not sure this is best but I wanted to keep up the pressure without taking time defending pawns which could be better spent attacking. I felt I was fairly close to a breakthrough and just needed to find the right lines....} Nd6 {The only place for the knight as it cant allow Rf7....} 23. Rf3 {Finally defending the pawn and preparing to double the rook presence on the f file} d4 24. c4 {Blunting the bishops vision whilst freeing up my f3 rook of the defense of d3.....} Bb7 25. Rf4 {Not ready to spring into action just yet. i need one more move to prepare....} Qc8 {Now I'm given the chance i pile on the pressure...} 26. Raf1 a5 {I'm guessing my opponent was happy with his defensive preparations and was waiting for the inevitable blow to fall and just decided to pawn push here...} 27. Rf4f7 {I'm sure this is the best continuation here, it does give up the exchange but the threats are nearing terminal and black has to make concessions if he is to survive...} Nxf7 28. Rxf7 {Now black has to offer up his queen as a lifeline in order to survive....} Qf8 29. Rxf8+ {I willingly oblige not seeing anything better....} Rxf8 30. Ne4 {I move in my remaining piece.....} Bxe4 {My opponent wants a rook V queen ending maybe he is thinking of working a pawn to promotion somehow...} 31. Qxe4 {Denying him a passed pawn....} Rb8 32. Qd5 a4 33. Qd7 Kf8 {I wanted to force the king onto the F file to finish him off and now that he has stepped into the open....} 34. Qc7 {Just need to force the rook back....} Re8 {sweet...} 35. Qf4+ Kg7 36. Qf7+ Kh8 37. Qxe8+ Kg7 38. Qxe7+ Kg8 39. Qf7+ Kh8 {Just a quick scan to make sure a pawn can be pushed...And....} 40. e7 b5 41. e8=Q# {A nice little win there....I found this game enjoyable to play hence the annotation and I hope in some way it entertained you too, thx for reading. }
