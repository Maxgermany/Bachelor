1. g3 {The 5th Game between Graham and myself.  This one was fairly long but i tried to hold on to a game i really should've resigned.} c6 2. Bg2 d5 {I different start from usual.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. O-O Bf5 5. d3 {Prepares development of the bishop} Qc7 {Dont really like to move my queen this early but i thought i would give it a try.  We are 2 for 2 in our four games so i was playing for a win. ( or so i thought ) lol.} 6. Bf4 {Confirms the thought.  Dont move her.} Qb6 {I really should not move my queen so early but felt i needed to try get in early for the win,  I was wrong :-)} 7. b3 {The pawn position has lots of weaknesses with the backwards pawns.} h6 {Prevent Bg5} 8. Nc3 Nbd7 9. Na4 {Again she is under pressure.  No real good square so time to retreat.} Qd8 10. Nd4 {I want to save this bishop for later.} Bh7 11. c4 {Time for a fork.  I was happy to see this and i thought i would have a better chance.  I have been pushed around a bit so far.} e5 12. Nxc6 {Forced to capture the knight or my queen goes for a long walk and she wont be back.} bxc6 13. Bd2 {A piece up and decent space control.  I need to hold onto this lead......} Nc5 {I thought being a piece up exchanges are in order to widen the gap.} 14. Nxc5 Bxc5 {I thought it best to exchange when you are a piece up.  With every exchange the difference becomes bigger.} 15. b4 Bd6 16. cxd5 Nxd5 17. a3 O-O 18. Rc1 {Threatens the unprotected pawn.} Rc8 19. e4 Nf6 20. Bh3 {Help,  need to run now.} Rc7 21. Qf3 Bg6 22. Rcb1 {Going to push some pawns.  I dont want them in my half of the board.} Be7 23. a4 Nxe4 {I thought if i can get my queen up there maybe i can attack from the back.} 24. dxe4 Qxd2 25. Rfd1 {No time though,  need to run again. :-)} Qg5 26. Qc3 Bxe4 27. Rde1 Bxb1 {Maybe graham missed that. ?} 28. Rxb1 c5 29. b5 Rb8 30. Qc4 Qg6 31. Re1 Bd6 {Gotta protect the pawns.  Graham setting up a trap here, but i see it coming.} 32. Rd1 Kh7 33. Bg2 {I saw the pin 34.Be4 and i lose the queen.  Nice try graham.  For the record,  graham did manage to catch me in the same trap a bit later on.  Well done buddy.} f5 34. Rd5 Qe6 35. Qd3 e4 36. Qd2 Rd7 37. Qd1 Rbb7 38. Bh3 Qg6 {Here it is.  Wait for it.............} 39. Bxf5 {It there is that sick feeling in your stomach when you know you just made a blunder and you really should have seen it coming.} Qxf5 {Got to try get something for it.} 40. Rxf5 Kg8 {Its really all over from here.  I knew graham would not let me off easily but i played on in hope.} 41. Rd5 Rb6 42. Qb3 {Its just a case of finishing me off so i will set back and let you watch.} Kf8 43. Rf5+ Ke8 44. Qg8+ Ke7 45. Rf7+ Ke6 46. Qe8+ Be7 47. Rxg7 Kd6 {I actually thought at this  stage that if i hold on long enough he might slip and let me back in.  Even though i have an extra piece they are not active so his pieces are a lot more valuable.} 48. Qg6+ Kc7 49. Qxe4 Bd6 50. Rg6 Re7 51. Qc4 h5 52. a5 Rb7 53. Qd5 Rd7 54. Qc6+ Kd8 55. Rxd6 Rxd6 56. Qxb7 Rd7 57. Qc6 {Its all over really.  Nice game graham.} Rc7 58. Qd6+ Kc8 59. b6 axb6 60. axb6 Rb7 61. Qxc5+ Kd8 62. f4 Rd7 63. Qf8# {An the pain is over.  Well played mate.  Thats 3 : 2 in your favour.  The next game i pulled one back. :-)}
