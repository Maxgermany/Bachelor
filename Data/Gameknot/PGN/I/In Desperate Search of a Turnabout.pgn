[Opening "English opening (A20)"]

1. c4 {I was pleased to see an attempt at the English. Often the play requires sharp thinking.} e5 {I reply with the common response.} 2. d3 {This varation is tried...} Nf6 {...and I follow...} 3. Be3 {-SLAM! And now the opening book has been metaphorically thrown out the window. This isn't in the lines of the English at all, and now I must think of how to proceed next.} Ng4 {I really don't know how to proceed effectively here, so I try disrupting White's development.} 4. Qd2 {To stop the pawn from capturing if an exchange. But, that diagonal is looking extremely dangerous...} Nc6 {So I prepare to advance both my development and the first attack of this match.} 5. d4 {I honestly don't know why this was played, but the computer reasonably doesn't like this move...} Bb4 {Striking White with a queen pin already. The issue must be dealt with.} 6. Nc3 {Forced.} Bxc3 {Up until now, Computer Analysis had me at a +1.6 lead, but now it plummets down to .65. I really wanted to tempt a capture with the b pawn, but figured I still looked good, considering White hasn't touched the kingside at all this match so far.} 7. Qxc3 {Maybe I shouldn't have given up my dark squared bishop so soon after all...} exd4 {So I decide to exchange again, hoping to hamper development even further. Obviously inaccurate.} 8. Bxd4 {And this was why. g7 is under a lot of delicate pressure at the moment...} Nxd4 {Yet I continue telling myself that I can just keep trying to attack.} 9. Qxd4 {And now I fully understand I just should have stopped. I want to play Nf6, but if I do that, then Qe3+ forces me to lose castling rights regardless if I trade queens or not.} Qg5 {But since the White Queen sits there, I can't just leave my knight unsupported either, so I must do something. The knight must be defended.} 10. Nf3 {And yet, now the kingside is ready to begin the harassment.} Qa5+ {I must buy my knight enough time to escape the grip of the queen.} 11. Nd2 {And yet I still don't see even after board analysis that this just wasn't the proper way of doing it. My attack energy has clearly completely lost all steam, and I must resort to desperate measures to prevent White from both either winning the knight for free or utterly wrecking my kingside, or harassing the king.} d6 {An insane move. My opponent was very taken aback by this, and yet, it does seem to solve most of my problems. I planned to snap a trap with this gambit...} 12. Qxg7 {White eagerly eats the pawn, thinking the kingside is lost, but...} Qe5 {...Miraculously, I did find a way to force the queens off. Now, GK computer finds this more damaging than say, suppose if I just did 11 ...Nf6, and White plays Qe3+, then Kd8, Qg3 Qxd2+, Kxd2 Ne4+, Ke3 Nxg3 as a way for me to neutralize the White Queen without having to give up the g pawn. Personally, I didn't trust my instincts on Nf6, preferring the ability to castle long over an awkwardly eventually placed king nearer the center (which I felt would be forced had it lost castling rights) than having a pawn at g7. However, and as we'll later see, I'm starting to doubt that this is actually a wise call in the long run...} 13. Qxe5+ {White is not about to pull a Grand Prix Queen gambit here. Pretty much forced. My opponent did comment toward me before, shocked at what I was willing to risk here. What can I say, though? It isn't always the case that attacking is the best defense, so I needed this queen gone!} Nxe5 {And finally it goes. I did realize I'm down a pawn, but I felt my mobility could balance this as even. GK disagrees, and puts me at even -1.15 at this point in the game.} 14. g3 {Both a good move and time to develop. This allows f4 and Bg2, followed by a good O-O.} Be6 {I'm not overly concerned at the moment, and I set my sights on winning back the pawn.} 15. b3 {Totally safe. I needed to find a different way to do this.} O-O-O {There were a few purposes to castling now, though I see a possibility that this was premature. The king wasn't being threatened, so it didn't need to go somewhere. I did see a way to launch an attack on the d rank after ...d5, but I had forgotten a very crucial fact: I have no initiative required for any attack...} 16. f4 {And now comes the punishment for my eagerness. Yet, the computer has improved to -.74...?} Nc6 {It doesn't like this spot, favoring likely Ng4-Nf6. I was more focused on winning the d4 square.} 17. Bg2 {White wins the long diagonal now, and can castle either way at this point.} Nd4 {Pointless... I should have at least played Bg4 first, but I didn't.} 18. Rc1 {Obvious.} Bg4 {...And now I play it just for fun...} 19. e3 {The knight needs to be defended now. But it hardly has any squares at this point where it just doesn't end up hindering the other pieces on the board...} Rhe8 {So I opted to just pin the pawn onto the king and exploit it for everything it is worth there.} 20. e4 {Despite being so distant from the king while under a pin... it still stuns me how safe this move was. It's looking more and more likely that I need to fully back away soon.} f5 {However... I did hatch a plan to punish the pin. White isn't going to just find his king at the queenside in a nice neat fashion, so I found this as an effective way to expose it.} 21. Kf2 {-so White does something I usually elect to do when under pin pressure of my own. The king is, in fact, an actual piece that can defend others. My situation has gotten a lot more complicated now, and I spent quite a few days thinking about my next move. I know what I really want to do: I want to find that rook I have at e2, forking the king against the knight or even maybe winning the bishop. Now, how do I do this...?} b5 {I kept staring at fxe4. I didn't like it, because White could easily fend it off. d5 would been a way to torment the pawn further, but it's null and void if this pawn is in the way. But this was a terrible mistake, and likely the first of the two decisive blunders I made this match. I wasn't doing my pawn structure any favors in making this move. GK puts me at -2.34 here, and I have to agree. It suggests Re6 (to counter a stacking of rook on the e file), though I wasn't ultimately concerned with this situation.} 22. h3 {My opponent, as I figured, was definitely more concerned with Black's grip on e2. } Bh5 {Daring White to play g4 to stop me from holding the e2 square.} 23. cxb5 {They grab this pawn though, to send the knight away. I'm seriously regretting my second-thoughts after my 21st move at this point. This game is becoming increasingly desperate with each bind I'm in.} Nxb5 {So away this knight goes....} 24. g4 {-and now White throws their kingside pawns at me again. Now, initially I was planning fxg4, because my pawns were generally closer to the center to be able to disrupt the e-f pawn team. So at first, I wanted to play that instead, thinking I could equalize the material that way.} fxe4 {But then I noticed something troubling. If fxg4, then hxg4 Bxg4, THEN Rxh7! And then, all White has to do to divert my only defender of c7 would be playing a simple a4, so following Rxh7 would have to be Rd7. And this would have me with an awkward placement of rooks, and I just did not trust that position at all.} 25. Bxe4 {Oh. But look. h7 is being attacked anyway. Lovely. Now Black has a terribly weak response against White's 3 pawns to my one on the far side of the board. So fxg4 was likely the better move, and this is where I feel is the second decisive blunder on my part for this match. What's going to happen next is probably clear to everyone at this point in the game...} Bg6 {Dropped pieces are no longer an option in this match.} 26. f5 {Not that it matters. I am now down to -4.34, and it looks like there's no saving me anymore.} d5 {I refuse to give up, though. I've made it back through worse situations, and there is ALWAYS the chance that I could force a draw. So I counter with pressure of my own.} 27. Bd3 {Not the best of ideas, considering I forgot there were other stranded pieces left to consider...} Ref8 {I felt the bishop was better in this case. GK hates this move, sending me down to -7.11.} 28. Bxb5 {This was painful. I honestly don't know where I found the mindset to keep going.} h5 {I could complicate matters if I expose the king at least, so I resume focusing my attention there.} 29. Ba6+ {I still find myself cursing ever playing ...b5, in the meantime.} Kb8 {My own king is looking awfully locked down at the moment. } 30. Rc6 {And now Black is confined to the a8 corner. As I've said before, this game just gets more and more dire for me, but I wasn't going to let my determination in this match falter just yet. I still had some wild ideas up my sleeve to allow for a shot at returning...} Be8 {This is the only move that continues protecting h5 while freeing my king.} 31. Rc5 {White wants to stay close. Now, watch what happens- White solved a lot of issues with a more active king, so the turnabout I'm looking for actually happens with White's failure to keep mine locked down...} c6 {Secures d5, is guarded, and allows further protection after granting the king the c7 flight square.} 32. Nf3 {White will now require the material advantage held to knock me back down. So out comes the knight, a less predictable piece, and I can feel my anxiety returning...} Kc7 {But I still press on. I'm ONLY -4, after all... (Or -7.33, apparently.)} 33. Nd4 {So, White elects to unravel my defenses, starting with my own fall of the c6 pawn.} Bd7 {I'm not having any of it, so I start maneuvering my bishop closer to the queenside part of the battle. But GK doesn't like any attempts of mine to try and trap White, yelling at me right away that Rhc1 will end all my proceedings on the spot. ...To be honest, I didn't realize it right away...} 34. Bb5 {...but neither does White, and the trap has sprung! The first truly deadly blunder by my friend happens here, and watch how wildly the tide begins to turn...!} Kb6 {The computer prefers Kd6, but I'm not aiming for any more drawish maneuvers. My chance to end this material deficit is right here and now. Both the extremely powerful bishop and rook are under threat.} 35. Nxc6 {And this horrible oversight is made... ending my strong defenses of d5, and winning my rook in the process, but, still, there is another rook whose fate was just decided...} Kxc5 {This is no longer just a rook exchange. One of those other pieces are falling down- my dream has become a reality, and I actually just might pull off a fighting chance for this game after all.} 36. Nxd8 {The computer says this is a wild recovery slightly favorable for White now, but claims that in the span of three moves each, we have gone from an 8.62 lead all the way down to a mere .46. I no longer care about the outcome of this match, because I already, in my own mind, won with this incredible turnaround.} Rxd8 {-which I then decisively blow here. I saw two possibilities and not the third one available; either this, or Bxb5 following an Ne6+ fork, killing my rook. I didn't see Kxb5, which now, I can tell would have brought this game that much closer to a fighting chance for me...} 37. Bxd7 {so because of my own rashness, I must accept my punishment and battle five pawns with only two.} Rxd7 {So I prepare to attack White, thinking gxh5 can be neutralized effectively after Rf7...!} 38. g5 {-No, too bad! 5v3 stands in place of 3v2. A very wise move by White, and a terrible decisive oversight by Black. Suddenly I need another back rank piece (i.e. Kxb5!) and I know now that Black no longer has any hopes possible on winning this game.} Kd6 {But I can still try to draw this out. I'm only down two pawns.} 39. Re1 {But no, my best weapon (and most consistent, mind you) has just been blocked out.} Re7 {After a very long time of thinking, I think it's time to remove the rooks and hope to neutralize the kingside pawns in time before it's too late.} 40. Rd1 {I was hoping White would try to avoid the exchange. GK claims the exchange obviously should have happened, because after Kxe7, threats of g6, b4, and Kf3 would ultimately decide this match. But now, I actually have a better chance...} Re5 {My opponent was horrified after this move.} 41. Rg1 {And they blunder again. Now I have a pawn less to worry about, and my king is welcomed into the battle once again. I can actually draw this match!} Rxf5+ {And they must now waste a move to a check.} 42. Ke1 {White's advantage is clearly diminishing; The king should have approached, not retreated.} Ke7 {Black must have an answer to g6 right here and now.} 43. h4 {Probably fearing my own h4, but this costs White a tempo. I know that my next move matters...} Kf7 {But I blow it again! ARGH! Now the rooks can be forced off. Somewhere in here, I also think there was a misclick as well, but nonetheless. GK says that White should have forced the rook exchange in this match all along, made possible again by this move...} 44. Rf1 {And here it is seized. My fire starts to die down... again.} Rxf1+ {Forced.} 45. Kxf1 {And forced.} Kg6 {So I finally place my king on this square to stop these pawns from advancing, but then I realize something horrible. The only piece that can capture h4 now is my king. But if it moves, the g pawn promotes. My heart drops here. I realize now that, quite simply, I can't do anything meaningful in this game anymore. Kf7 was just such a terrible, terrible mistake...} 46. Ke2 {Not wanting to advance on the queenside yet, White's final piece goes active again.} Kf5 {I bring about a bravado, at least hoping for a promotion wayward to delay g's promotion.} 47. Ke3 {The advance continues...} Ke5 {And this is as far as possible for my king to advance.} 48. a4 {...Well, then this just allows...} a5 {And even though I am down a pawn on the queenside, I now own the board that way. White can dare to try moving the king to b4, but that allows me to secure the d pawn's promotion.} 49. g6 {And yet? Remember Qxg7, everyone? Here you have it. That move played such a long time ago, hoping a centralized king wouldn't falter in place of a castled one? That costed me my own g7 pawn. If it were still there, then this endgame would have been a much different finish, now wouldn't it?} Kf6 {Forced.} 50. g7 {Not even necessary. Watch: (49. g6 Kf6, Kd4 Kxg6, Kxd5 Kf5...)} Kxg7 {Because either way, Black has to place the king on g, allowing this...} 51. Kd4 {Now White wins the Queenside. But wait, don't I now have the kingside?} Kf6 {I'm really hoping at this point, since this is my only chance, that I am not a move behind. OR, if I am, that I can balance tempo in the next moves.} 52. Kxd5 {Here we go. Let's start counting.} Kf5 {Moves until h4 falls: 2} 53. Kc4 {Moves until a5 falls: 2} Kg4 {1} 54. b4 {1} axb4 {1...} 55. Kxb4 {0.} Kxh4 {0. ...Well, then I might be able to secure a Queen versus Queen endgame battle royale. Literally.} 56. a5 {Moves until a8=Q: 3.} Kg3 {Moves until h1=Q: 4, but if the king can make it to the pawn as it promotes...!} 57. a6 {2.} h4 {3.} 58. a7 {1.} h3 {2...} 59. a8=Q {0. Well. And now I realized the move that is made only possible from a8=Q, and dooms me entirely.} h2 {If only it was b8...} 60. Qh1 {or c....} Kh3 {or d....} 61. Kc3 {or e....} Kg3 {or f...} 62. Kd2 {or g...} Kh3 {or h...! Then a draw could have been at least feasible. But not with this king freeing-freezing ability to hold onto h1 without my king being able to grab it.} 63. Ke2 {Well... Mate is now forced, and White's King is eagerly on the way...} Kg3 {I could delay this longer, if I really wanted to.} 64. Kf1 {But there isn't really a point. So I resign here. For a 64 move match in which I was mostly losing according to post-game analysis throughout, I very much enjoyed the opportunity I held for most of it. I was very disappointed here, but it was an incredible match anyway. A great match. Was there anything else I've overlooked that could have helped either of us out? If not, then thanks for reading this annotation!}
