1. e4 {Her usual move.} d5 {On the theory of "we've tried everything else against her."} 2. exd5 {Obvious...} Qxd5 {The natural recapture.} 3. Nc3 {Strong and natural, forcing the Queen to move again.} Qd8 {The alternative move is 3... Q-QR4, but this seemed safer.} 4. d4 {Miss L. strengthens her center.} e6 {A natural reply, stopping P-Q5 and opening a line for the KB to develop.} 5. Bd3 {T. M. was shocked at this move. I remember him poking me with his elbow, as if to say, "I can't believe she made a mistake!"} Qxd4 {T. M. snags the loose Pawn. What he missed was...} 6. Bb5+ {Checking the King and attacking the Queen. T. M. looked disgusted as he resigned... not that he lost to her, but that it happened so darn fast!}
