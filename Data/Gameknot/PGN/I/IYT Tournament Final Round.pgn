1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nc6 {Here my opponent deviates from the Main line of the Philidor which would be 3 ... exd4.} 4. dxe5 {Planning to trade off pawns (maybe knights also) and then exchange queens which will force black to lose the ability to castle or else retreat his knight.} dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 6. Bc4 {Now developing with an attack against the f7 pawn which is a little awkward to defend.  } f6 {Saves the pawn but blocks the most natural square for the g8 knight to develop to.} 7. O-O Bd6 8. Be3 Bg4 {Both sides continue development.} 9. Nh4 {Trying to avoid an exchange and doubling of pawns, but 9. Nbd2 might have accomplished that better.} g6 {Keeping the knight off of f5.} 10. h3 Bd7 {Driving the Bishop away from its hold of d1.} 11. Rd1 Be7 {? This move loses time due to ...} 12. Be6 {Threatening to win the white-squared bishop.} Bd6 13. Bxd7 Kxd7 14. Nc3 a6 15. Rd2 Ke6 16. a3 {Both sides jockey for position and control of the queenside squares.} Nge7 {Black finally develops his last piece, but his rooks still sit in the corners.} 17. Nd5 Na5 {Looking at the fork on c4 (pawn, bishop, and rook).} 18. Bc5 {Threatening to exchange bishops and fork with the knight on c7.} Nxd5 19. Bxd6 cxd6 20. exd5+ {Gaining another tempo.  Both sides have a knight on the edge but with this move and the next the black knight becomes quite restricted.} Kd7 21. b3 b5 22. g3 Rae8 23. Re1 Nb7 24. b4 {Tightening the noose on the black knights mobility.} a5 25. Ng2 {Finally getting the knight back into play after the questionable 9th move.  16 moves of inactivity is the price paid here.} axb4 26. axb4 Rea8 {Taking the open file, which will cause white some problems.} 27. Ne3 Ra4 {Preparing to double the rooks with a tempo on the b pawn.} 28. c3 Rha8 29. Kg2 {Getting the king onto a sheltered row and closer to endgame action.} f5 30. Kf3 e4+ 31. Kf4 {The white king finds a nice outpost where it will be in good position when some of the piece power is traded off. } Ra4a2 32. Ree2 {Declining to trade on black's terms.} Ra2a3 33. Rdc2 Rc8 34. Nd1 {White's knight takes over defensive duties so the big boys can get to work.} Nd8 {Trying to find a good home for the restricted black knight, perhaps headed for e5.} 35. Rca2 {Trying to force a pair of rooks off.} Rxa2 {? Black obliges and gives white control of the valuable a file.} 36. Rxa2 Nf7 37. Ra7+ {The rook invades threatening king, knight, and pawn.} Ke8 38. g4 {With the black pieces mostly under control white prepares to break up the black pawn structure.} fxg4 39. hxg4 Rd8 40. Kxe4 Rd7 {Black buys some freedom but with the rooks coming off the extra pawn becomes that much more of a threat.} 41. Rxd7 Kxd7 42. f4 {Once again restricting the black knight.} h5 43. gxh5 gxh5 44. Kf5 {From f5 the white king can hold the passed h pawn at bay while the white knight and pawns show their hidden potential.} Ke7 45. Ne3 Kf8 46. c4 bxc4 47. Nxc4 {Now Black must worry about the b pawn too.  There are too many threats and the black knight cannot find anything to do.} Ke7 48. b5 Nd8 49. Kg5 {Black resigned as a white pawn will inevitably queen.  The restriction of the black knight from move 21 on seems to have been the decisive factor in the game. With white having his knight out of the game for 16 moves and black for 28 after their respective moves to the edge of the board, I think this game definitely demonstrates that a knight on the rim is dim.}
