1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. h3 {Yes, I know, a loss of time... but there is little difference, this is part of my scheme anyway. } Nbd7 5. Nbd2 b6 {This fianchetto is good, in my opinion. It creates for me the need to be extremely careful about the removing of the d pawn (needed for exchanges in e5 to come). I played on it in this game. } 6. e3 {Not passive, since it is part of my "dream" setup. Why try to push d4? It will just be "make his game". } Bb7 7. g4 {If he can't force me to remove d4, I can play risky on the Kside (my standard plan is to castle Qside). } Bd6 {Now the option: Bh2, and if BxB nothing happens (I don't mind to lose the castling rights). Here I took my first "risky move". } 8. Ne5 {After the exchanges, I can have some compensation for the tempo he will spend in taking my R. Not a precise idea, just a feeling.} Nxe5 9. dxe5 d4 {Critical moment. A lot of possible moves, too hard for me going through all them. 1) I move the R, and the fork trheat is still "on". But dxe3, and if I get the piece, exf2+. Scary. 2) I take one piece and let my R to be taken: exB, and if BxR, exc7, and the Q has to move. Enough? 3) I take the N, and if BxR, fxg7, threatening the R, say Rg8, Bh6. Enough? 4) Block the B's diagonal. With f3 (dxe3 still looks dangerous for me), 5) with e4, and finally 6) with Nf3.  Very hard decision in a blitz.  } 10. e4 {I sac the pawn, but I avoid dxe3. Now I get to my op a way out from the fork, in a way: } Nxe4 11. exd6 {I bet, here, that I will have compensatio for the R. } Nxd2 12. Bb5+ {?? Damn, this was a great flare. dxc7 shoud have been played first!!!} c6 {Gulp! Still, I can get out from this.} 13. Qxd2 cxb5 {...and now I can save the R. But... what are we here for? :-)} 14. Qxd4 {Second critical moment. Now, he R will cost him Qxg7, a ferocious attack (I can only see the f7 pawn's weakness...)} Bxh1 15. Qxg7 Kd7 {Black prefers this to Rf8, Bh6, Kd7. } 16. Qxf7+ Kc6 {Can someone remove my c2 pawn from the board, please? To remove one's piece would be cheating? :-D. Now, seriously. I considered Qxe6, but there is nothing to counter Re8. I considered the "emergency plan" Qc8+, QxQ, dxQ, being defended by my lsb. Moreover, I'd have to take care of Rf8, and if my Q moves, RxB. } 17. O-O-O {This makes possible qxe6, threats the B, and a possible R ride to c3. But does nothing against Rf8.} Rf8 18. Qxe6 {With the lsb, it would have been a thematic mate net (after d7+). Can I make it work without it?} Rxf4 19. d7+ Kb7 20. Rxh1 {This makes Qd5+ possible. Qe8 is not possible right now, but it must be kept in mind.} Rf6 21. Qe4+ {? Qd5+ was much better, with Re1-Re8 in mind, but hey, Rc7 and I can't lose my pawn...} Rc6 22. Rd1 {Ready for Qe8!} Qc7 {Uh-oh! This is also thematic: a threat on c2 with check. No mate in sight (until Rd1 is in its place). So let's go on. } 23. Qe8 Rd8 {A lovely position, isn't it? Black DOESN'T threats Rxd7, because after Rxd7, Rxc2, Kd1! (Kb2, Rc1#) and it can shield behind f2 and black will lose the Q. He cant' take my Q, either. But what can I do??} 24. c3 {Stupid move, better was Kb1.} b4 25. Kb1 bxc3 26. bxc3 Rxc3 27. Qe4+ {? Allows him to...} Qc6 {...and the game is over. I can't escape the Q's exchange, save my K AND my d7 pawn. After it, it's just a R down, not enough for my f and g pawns to make it. } 28. Qxc6+ Kxc6 {}
