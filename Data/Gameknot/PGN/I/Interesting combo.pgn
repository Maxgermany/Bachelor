1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 Nxd4 4. Nxd4 exd4 5. Qxd4 {Scotch Game} c5 {Black tries to make me move my queen, but I have a better idea.} 6. Qe5+ {Qe5 .  This either gives a queen trade after 6 ...Qe7, gives me the pawn after 6 ...Ne7, or gives me a pawn (and possibly a rook) after 6 ...Be7? 7.Qxg7.} Ne7 {Black plays smart and chooses to block with the knight.} 7. Qxc5 {I gladly take the pawn, but wary for the discovered attack on the queen if the knight moves.} Nc6 {Sure enough, there's the attack.} 8. Qc4 {So I move my queen back.} Ne5 9. Qd5 Qf6 10. Be2 {I play Be2, hoping to castle on my next turn to avoid any f2 attacks.  I also want to play Bb5, to pin the pawn and trap the black bishop and thus also trap the queenside rook.} d6 {d6? Black wants to activate his bishop, but this leaves him open for checks.} 11. Bb5+ {I play Bb5 , taking advantage of this opportunity.} Bd7 {Black defends with Bb7.  This leaves me free to take the b-pawn and cripple black''s defensive position!} 12. Qxb7 {Qxb7!  I now dominate this game.} Rc8 {Black tries to save his rook.} 13. Bxd7+ {Bxd7 ! Seriously pressuring black's king, who now realizes his mistake of being under-defended.} Nxd7 14. Qxc8+ {Qxc8 .  This forces black to move and leaves me with the possibility for a huge pin of the h4-d8 diagonal.} Ke7 15. O-O {I castle to get my king out of the way in case black decides to try and check me.} Qe5 16. Nc3 {Nc3, threatening 17.Nd5  Ke6 18. Qe8  Be7 19. Qxe7#, unless black wants to give up his queen.} Nf6 {Nf6, a valiant attempt to stop the knight.} 17. Bg5 h6 {h6, a try to stop the pin.  However, I don't have to worry about that as..} 18. Nd5+ {Nd5 !! Black's only move is to take the knight and give up his queen.  Black resigned, an excellent well-needed victory for me.}
