1. e4 e5 {Freddy had sent this game with the title 'Back to the Base Man'. 'Base Man' referred to the Basman Defence, something which I'd shown an interest in in the forums. Missing out on that hint, I play a normal king's pawn game... } 2. Qh5 {...but that's not to say we're going to play a normal game! This is the Patzer opening, usually associated with beginner play. There is a thematic trap here that I have fallen for a few times in the past [2...g6?? 3.Qxe5+!] Though the opening is considered weak [actually, using GK analysis this isn't too horrible an opening], I don't get my hopes up - he played an even weaker opening against Joanne [jstevens1] and disposed of her in just 30 moves - and that was against a player 400 rating points above my own! Here's the annotation of that game; http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/when-or-where-is-it-safe-to-castle?gm=31623 } Nc6 {The best move in the position, developing while protecting the e5 pawn. } 3. Bc4 {As well as developing the bishop, this move also threatens the cheap Scholar's Mate. } g6 {Once again, the threat is easily parried } 4. Qd1 {The queen returns to the d1 square - counter-intuitive, to be sure, but I'm guessing that this was played to let me have a bit of an advantage to compensate for the huge difference in rating } Nf6 {The normal move seen, Qf3, would have provoked this move to ward off Scholar's Mate once again. There's no reason not to play this move here anyway. } 5. Nc3 {Natual - development while saving the e4 pawn at the same time } Bg7 {Natural again - though the diagonal is partially closed, it makes sense to fianchetto the bishop } 6. d3 d6 {Both sides open up lines for their undeveloped bishops } 7. a4 {What this? queenside action? } O-O {After seeing that move, I castled immediately kingside - any ideas for queenside castling is out of the question if there is any possibility of a queenside pawn storm. Plus, Freddy is most likely looking to castle kingside himself. However, sometime after this move, I started to get just a little bit worried - what if there was something in 8.a5? [normal question mark, by the way] Possibly that was paranoid thinking there lol } 8. Nge2 {hmmm... guess there isn't immediate plans for the pawn after all... } a5 {...so I take the opportunity to halt it now to prevent unpleasant tactics later on } 9. O-O Bg4 {Bishop development - this was the only logical place for the bishop. the f5 and h3 squares are prohibited for obvious reasons, Bd7 is too inactive and Be6 allows Bxe6, weakening my pawn structure } 10. Be3 {For Freddy, the e3 square is where the bishop has the most scope, though Bg5 is also playable } Nb4 {!? I considered Qd7 here, but I also had plans to push my d6 pawn forward at an attempt at a centre break. This knight move targets d5 for that break [it also targets c2, but that's irrelevant; the White queen is naturally guarding it anyway] } 11. f3 {! The centre break will have to wait - this move made me regret playing Nb4 instead of Qd7, as Qd7 would have allowed Be6. Bh5, of course, is met with g4... } Bd7 {...so this is the only viable alternative, and as I've said before, this isn't a very active posting for the bishop. It also delays my desired pawn break because the bishop blocks the queen. } 12. d4 {!? Looks like Freddy has similar ideas! his d-pawn pushes forward first, and after the exchange of pawns... } exd4 13. Nxd4 {...he obtains a centralised knight. At the time of the pawn exchange, I had ideas of chasing away the knight with 13...c5, but then it gives the knight an outpost on the b5 square, and that made me uncomfortable. } c6 {unwilling to allow that outpost, I continue to prepare d5. Perhaps Bc6 would have been an idea as well } 14. Qd2 {Connecting the rooks, while preparing a future Bh6... } d5 {and Black gets his pawn thrust! Still unwilling to allow the b5 square for the knight, a plethora of exchanges ensue... } 15. exd5 Nbxd5 16. Bxd5 Nxd5 17. Nxd5 cxd5 {Now that there isn't so much going on queenside, a knight on b5 now isn't as threatening as it was earlier, especially since Black would have the option of exchanging it off } 18. Bh6 {The aforementioned bishop thrust, which strips Black of the bishop pair } Qb6 {! This move probably isn't strong enough to deserve the exclam mark, but personally I really liked this move - attacking both b2 and d4 while improving the position of my queen. Unplayable is 18...Bxd4+??, where after 19.Qxd4!, where Black must lose the exchange (f6) to prevent checkmate } 19. Bxg7 {This move is forced to save material - 19.c3? Bxh6 20.Qxh6 Qxb2 drops a pawn } Kxg7 20. b3 {saving the pawn... though for now, there was no need to make this move, because that pawn would have been poison e.g. 20.h3 Qxb2?? 21.Rfb1! wins the queen... Better safe than sorry, I guess } Rfe8 {The only logical move that I could find in the position, grabbing the only open file on the board } 21. c3 {Freddy relieves the queen of any defensive duties with regards to the knight } Re7 22. Rae1 {Freddy contests my control of the e-file... } Rae8 {...while I double up pawns on the e-file, though Freddy's d2 queen prevents me from obtaining complete control of the e-file } 23. Rxe7 {A rook exchange... } Rxe7 24. Re1 {...and Freddy brings his other rook to the e-file to contest the file. } Qf6 {The rook must be protected - this and Qd6 are both fine moves } 25. Qf2 h5 {I push my h-pawn forward... } 26. h4 {...and Freddy hinders it - a mirror image of the pawns on the a-file } Qd6 {I had absolutely no idea what to do at this point, so I play a waiting move - there is no attacking opportunities for either side right now } 27. Rxe7 {The second pair of rooks come off the board. } Qxe7 28. Kf1 {Running this game through the Gameknot Database, the number of inaccuracies from both sides add up to... zero. So far, both sides have played solid games, and the game has been pretty much equal throughout. Freddy did admit after this move that he hadn't been playing his best in this game, but still, keeping toe-to-toe with a player so much better than I am is cool :) } f5 {? My first mistake, and now White has the advantage. Freddy recommended f5 here, while the Gameknot analysis machine recommended Qe5. Both moves are designed to prevent a queen invasion from White... } 29. Qg3 {! With this move! White now threatens to invade via the c7 or b8 square, with the additional threat on the b7 pawn. To protect c7 and the pawn, the bishop needs to be moved, and for that idea, Bc8 is recommended. } Bc6 {?? And this move is a big no-no! As I've mentioned, this has been an equal game so far, excluding 28...f5. Now, two moves later, Black is totally losing! Just goes to show how sudden and unforgiving chess can be at times... } 30. Nxf5+ {! The pin on the g-pawn turns this attack into an elementary king and queen fork, and that is never a good way to lose a game! I would have thought that the ensuing endgame could have been pretty interesting, though I'd most likely lose anyway } Kf6 {Walks into a mate in eight, but this game is hopelessly lost anyway. If you want to try and work it out, here's the puzzle from this position; http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=29034 } 31. Qg5+ {The funny thing is that GK analysis had not actually seen the mate that followed after this, and recommended Nxe7 after this move. Though it is winning, it does not lead to mate... } Ke6 32. Qxe7+ {!! Only after Freddy had played this move did the computer see the mate - I'll give him two exclams for that! :) } Kxf5 33. Kf2 Kf4 34. Qf6# {Game over! possibly my best try against the Master Mater so far, but still, it could have been an even better attempt if it weren't for my 29th move... still, good game! }
