[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's Defense.  This move isn't exactly bad, but I don't recommend it unless you know exactly what you're doing. Black would be better off defending the pawn while developing a piece (…Nc6, …Nf6).} 3. h3 {? Way too slow. White also should be developing his pieces.} c5 {!? Interesting. This grabs a big share of the center, but again I think Black would be better off developing pieces.} 4. c3 {! A good plan: preparing to blow the center open.} Bd7 {?! Black now develops a piece, but not the right one or to the right square. …Nf6 would be more to the point: it gets Black one step closer to castling and attacks the e-pawn. Also, the LSB (Light-Squared Bishop) is better placed on e6, not d7. Development is good, but should be planned out and not done randomly.} 5. d4 {! Again, White has exactly the right idea: to open the center and then punish Black's slow development. White's pieces will be able to develop rapidly once the Black pawns are weakened.} Nc6 {Good, now Black is catching up. …Nf6 is still better for the reasons stated in Black's last move.} 6. Ng5 {? Too much! White cannot attack with just one Knight. Bc4 was just crying out to be played.} Nf6 {? This developing move is too late. …Be7 is better, attacking the Knight and leaving the defensive move …Nh6 open.} 7. Nxf7 {?? This is the logical follow-up to White's play, but it just loses a piece. Again, you can't attack with just one piece! Bc4 was again obvious, natural and good. Black would have no good way to defend the f-pawn. } Kxf7 8. Bc4+ {Now this move comes… two moves too late.} Ke8 9. Qb3 {Where is White's attack? Black has the extra material AND the lead in development.} exd4 {! Good, clearing some tension in the center to reduce complications.} 10. Bf7+ {?! Pointless checks are pointless.} Ke7 11. Bg5 {Finally getting some more pieces involved.} h6 12. Bxf6+ gxf6 13. Bg8 {With a cheapo threat.} Ne5 {!? A very tricky way to defend, giving back a single pawn to exchange off White's last aggressive piece. Good eye!} 14. cxd4 c4 {! Forcing exchanges.} 15. Bxc4 Nxc4 16. Qxc4 Rc8 17. Qe2 {Now it is Black who attacks. I like how you didn't get stuck in defensive mode and seized your chance to end it quickly.} Rc1+ {! Things don't look good for White…} 18. Kd2 Rxh1 19. e5 {! White seizes on every chance for counterplay, but it's not enough.} Qa5+ {! Rather than defending, Black wraps things up with a nice attack before anything strange can happen on the e-file.} 20. Kd3 {The worst of a set of bad options.} Bb5+ {! No way Black was letting that one go. Excellent counterattacking.}
