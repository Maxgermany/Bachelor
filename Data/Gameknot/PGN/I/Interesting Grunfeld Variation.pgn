1. d4 g6 2. c4 Bg7 {A Modern opening that soon transposes into the Grunfeld. } 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 d5 {Strange, usually this is played before Bg7 but this will likely transpose into a normal Grunfeld. } 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bd2 {This is an interesting move I picked up from my chess coach Vojislav Milanovic. The idea is to take on c3 with the bishop to effectively prevent a future c5. } O-O 7. e4 Nxc3 8. Bxc3 Nc6 {This is the right idea but the wrong move. Much better is c5 to put instant pressure on the center and then to maybe follow up with Nc6. } 9. Be2 {Standard development. } Bg4 {Trying to undermine d4 by eliminating one of its defenders. } 10. d5 {The only move. } Bxf3 11. Bxf3 Ne5 12. Be2 {Maintaining the bishop pair.  } c6 13. f4 {I plan to take control of the center, play Bxg7 and then castle. } Nd7 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 15. O-O cxd5 16. Qxd5 {Keeping good pawn structure and central control. } e6 {Just giving me a free pawn with very little (if any) compensation. } 17. Qxb7 Rb8 {Just giving up another pawn. } 18. Qxa7 Qc8 19. b3 Nb6 20. Rac1 {Taking control of the open c-file. } Qd8 21. Rfd1 Qf6 22. g3 {Strengthening my position. } Qb2 23. Bf3 {Preparing to open up the h1-a8 diagonal at an opportune moment. } Kg8 {I think my opponent was afraid of the maneuver Qa5-c3+ to trade queens and go into a winning endgame. } 24. Qa5 Nd7 25. Qd2 {Offering a trade of queens. Black is forced to accept or he loses his d7 knight. } Qxd2 26. Rxd2 Nb6 {White has a much better position and is winning. } 27. a4 {My idea is to play a5 and then march the a pawn all the way down the board to queen it. } Nc8 28. Rb1 {Supporting the b-pawn. } Nb6 29. a5 Na4 {Hoping I will take on a4. Of course I see through the trap. } 30. b4 Nc3 31. Rb3 Nb5 {Establishing the knight on a good square. } 32. e5 {I plan to play something along the lines of Bc6 and eliminating the knight. } Nc7 33. Bc6 Rfd8 {Offering a trade. } 34. Rxd8+ {I accept. } Rxd8 35. b5 {The game is almost over.  } Rb8 36. b6 Na6 37. Bb5 {Trying to get rid of the knight. } Nc5 38. Rc3 Ne4 39. Rc4 Nd2 40. Rc7 Nb3 41. b7 {The game is all over. } Nxa5 42. Rc8+ Kg7 43. Rxb8 Nxb7 44. Rxb7 {My opponent resigns. }
