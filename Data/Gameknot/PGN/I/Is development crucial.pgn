[White "Adolf Andersson (N/A)"]
[Black "Paul Morphy (N/A)"]
[Opening "KGA (C33), bishop's gambit, Cozio (Morphy) defence"]

1. e4 {This was the standard opening move for the players of that time.} e5 {Morphy sticks to his classical approach to chess. Always playing the King pawn openings when possible.} 2. f4 {The king's gambit. This opening was very popular in the 19th century. Although more rare these days it still has a sound reputation.} exf4 {Nowadays this is considered the best way to play as black. } 3. Bc4 {This move is contradictory to the opening principle that you should move your knights before bishops. HOwever it is an adequate move. It was famously moved by Bobby Ficher with 100% scored. Although I think the best move would be 3.Nf3.} Nf6 {Morphy shows that he was ahead of his time by developing his knight as he did most of the time when he played the opening.} 4. e5 {Andersson was seduced by this early attack on blacks knight thinking that it would gane him a tempo. However as you will see Morphy's precise play does the complete opposite. } d5 {! Morphy doesn't bother moving his threatened knight but instead decides to answer an attack with an attack.While also opening a diagonal for his queen's bishop and preparing an outpost for his knight on e4. Pretty good, no?} 5. Bb3 {If 5. exf6 dxc4 black looks better because of his easier development and the bishop pair.} Ne4 {This secures the knight in an accurate position while blacks light squared bishop has been demoted toa passive role on b3.} 6. Nf3 {Standard developing move.} Bg4 7. O-O Nc6 {Standard development so. It is obvious now that black is inn a much better position because of his speedy development. N.B- white's queenside has not developed a single piece and has put white at a disadvantage for time.} 8. Ba4 {Moprhy's development advantage increases as again white fails to develop any of his queenside pieces.} g5 {This move is very ambitious. It is obvious that Moprhy wants to expand on the queenside and secure his pawn f4 pawn. However he weakens his kingside. A more solid move would have been 8...Ng5 moving his knight to a more stable position less likely to come under attack from whites queen pawn.} 9. Bxc6+ bxc6 {Now white has a clear advantage in development. Anderssons's idea of the black's doubled c-pawns beingweak is absurd as you will see Morphy uses these pawns to his advantage.} 10. d4 c5 {This aims to undermines white's centre.} 11. c3 {Defending the d4 pawn.} Be7 12. b4 {Andersson finally realises he is not in a good position. He tries to stop his centre being dissapated.} cxb4 13. cxb4 O-O 14. Qb3 Rb8 15. a3 c5 {! White can no longer keep his blockade.} 16. Nc3 Nxc3 17. Qxc3 cxb4 18. axb4 Bxb4 19. Qd3 a5 {Now blacks development advantage has been turned into a substantial positional advantage.} 20. h4 h6 21. hxg5 hxg5 22. g3 {This is Anderssons last attempt to salvage his position.} Rb6 23. Ra2 Rg6 {Whit this move black secures his kingside.} 24. Rg2 Bh3 25. e6 Bxg2 26. exf7+ Kg7 27. Kxg2 Qc8 {Now with blacks next few moves black gets ready for his final attack.} 28. Ne5 Rh6 29. gxf4 Rfh8 30. fxg5 Rh6h2+ 31. Kg1 Rh2h1+ 32. Kf2 Rh8h2+ 33. Ke3 Rh2h3+ 34. Nf3 Rxf3+ 35. Rxf3 Qxc1+ 36. Kf2 Qe1+ 37. Kg2 Qg1# {I think you will agree when I say that this goes to show that a development advantage can lead to an easy game for the player with the advantage aslong as he keeps the intiative. SO to answer the question "is development crucial?" the resounding anwer is yes! I hope you enjoyed my annotation. If you have any feedback or you think I have made any mistakes please PM.  Tom}
