1. c4 d5 2. cxd5 c6 {The move d5 surprised me a little. It's usually done after e6 or something so that there is a pawn on d5, blocking my g2 bishop. So I took on d5 with pleasure and then my opponent desided to sacrifice a pawn for development. } 3. dxc6 Nxc6 {After the sacrifice is accepted, I couldn't play d4. What we expect now is that my opponent will play e5 at some time. I would play e4 and afterwards I'll have stalled pawn on d3. That's some kind of compensation for his sacrifice. } 4. f4 {By playing f4 I aim to stop his plan for playing e5 and having a strong center. At the same time I convert into Bird variation. It's idea is to play b3 and Bb2 attacking the square e5. What's even better is that that way I won't have to play with d3-e4 pawn structure. } e5 {I thought of that and liked it for the simple reason that I would have 2 center pawn and he none. } 5. fxe5 Nxe5 {Here its clear that he has one more developed piece. Also his bishops are ready to move. } 6. d4 Nc6 7. Nf3 {I played that instead of e3 cause I hoped that my c1 bishop would be well placed later. } Bg4 {Aiming to take on d4 afterwards. } 8. Bg5 {The other possible moves were e3 and Be3. 8.e3 was blocking my c1 bishop. Be3 was kinda good but it slows my development and also Bg5 aims at exchanging pieces. I should do that when I have a pawn more. } Qa5+ {At the same time attacks my g5 bishop. For example if 9. Nc3 Bxf3 10. exf Qxg5. } 9. Bd2 {The other possibility was Qd2. Looks good but I did let it after I saw the following 9. Qd2 Bb4 10. Nc3 Nf6 . Then Ne4 would be inevitable and would do a lot of problems. } Bb4 {Either that or moving his queen again while I was developing. Here, I was almost sure that we will exchange bishops at some point, so I was happy. } 10. e3 {Still needs to be defended. } Nf6 11. Bd3 {Guarding the e4 square. } O-O 12. O-O {He is fully developed so it's time for hime to come up with a plan to attack. } Qh5 {I didn't see what is doing that. At first I thought of Bxb4 or Nc3. Both were leading to a good position. Than I saw that I might try to take more material. } 13. Qb3 {It looks a strong move, but I had to calculate like ten moves forward to be sure of that. } Bd6 {Qb3 leads to sharp position cause black keep that black square bishop and can even join it in the kingside attack. Other way, such attack was completely pointless. Now the treat is Bxf3 followed by taking on h2.  Note that I have no way to defend that h2 pawn. If g3, I lose my knight. } 14. Qxb7 {So I decide to give up the h2 pawn and take other for it. } Bxf3 15. Rxf3 {Only move. If 15. gxf Qh2 mate } Qxh2+ 16. Kf2 {I want you to note that if 16. Kf1 there is 16... Qh1+ 17. Kf2 (17. Ke2 Qxg2+ 18. Rf2 Nxd4+ losing my queen) Ng4+ 18. Ke2 Qxg2 losing my pawn wit a check and my rook afterwards. } Ng4+ 17. Ke1 {The difference now is that if black 17.... Qxg2 I might take the knight on c6 and defend my rook with my queen. If black try to enter the other variations by playing 17... Qg1+ I might play 18. Bf1 and still have a pawn more. } Bg3+ {Expected. } 18. Kd1 {Only move. } Nf2+ {I thought of that too and I was completely ok with the following tradings. } 19. Rxf2 Bxf2 20. Qxc6 {Two light pieces for a rook and keeping my g2 pawn. Bigger material advantage bu I still have to develop and hide my king. } Rab8 21. Qf3 {That is how far I saw after I played 13. Qb3 I thought there would be 21... Bh4 22. Qh3 forcing the exchange of queens and easy win. } Bg3 {Well, that's it for my plans for exchanging queens.  Now my aim is to maintain a solid position until I develop. } 22. b3 {Won't let a pawn go. } Rb6 {That scared me cause I saw how I couldn't keep the rook from going on f2 and taking my g2 pawn. } 23. Kc2 Rf6 24. Qe4 Rf2 {Note that after taking on g2 there would be two peces attacking my d2 bishop and a black bishop waiting to join from e1. } 25. Na3 {Better than Nc3. That way my knight could defent my bishop from c4 and my rook could join. } Rxg2 26. Nc4 Rc8 {Bringing down one of the defenders. } 27. Rd1 Be1 {I guess here my opponent expected 28. Rxe1 Rxd2+ and then 29... Rxa2 with serious problems for me. } 28. Qxh7+ {What he failed to see. I take a pawn more and exchange the queens. } Qxh7 29. Bxh7+ {With check. } Kxh7 30. Rxe1 {Great position for me. But still, there's a long endgame to be played. } g5 31. Kd3 Kg7 32. a4 {I decided that's it's better to play on the queenside first. You see, my opponend moves would be about the g4 pawn on the kingside. By playing like that, I aim to distribute his forces, so he doesn't have many good chances. Also, the a4 move lets me move my bishop. } Rh8 33. b4 g4 {That's happening slow fro him. } 34. e4 {Keeps him from using the f pawn. Also lets me play my knight on e3 } Rh3+ 35. Ne3 {There is no g3 cause of Nxg2} Kf8 {He doesn't have many moves that make sense. } 36. b5 {fixating. } Ke8 {So king going on the queenside it would be. } 37. e5 Kd7 38. d5 {My pawns are just going forward. } Rf3 39. Bc3 g3 {That took him 2 moves. } 40. Ke4 {attac-king. } Rgf2 41. a5 {Basicaly moving my pieces forward while I wait the position on the kingside to be stuck. } g2 42. Rg1 {There it is. } Rh3 43. Bd4 {My opponent resigns, seeing that I have much more possibilities ant he culd move his g pawn anymore. }
