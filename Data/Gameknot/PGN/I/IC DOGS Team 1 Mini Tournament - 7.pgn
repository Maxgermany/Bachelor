[Opening "Sicilian (B22), Alapin's variation (2.c3)"]

1. e4 {1. e4 occupies a center square and attacks another (d5).  It opens lines for the king bishop and for the queen.  The e-pawn has passed by the d4 and f4 squares, however, and can never be used to fight for those squares.  } c5 {The Sicilian seeks to avoid symmetry, and to keep the position imbalanced.} 2. c3 {A slower approach with the obvious intention of establishing a pawn duo on d4 and e4.  2. Nf3 and 3. d4 leads to the open Sicilian which is the most challenging way to proceed.} g6 {Black is going to fianchetto the king bishop (flank development to g7) where it is relatively safe from attack, but still influences the center.} 3. d4 {White's continues with the plan.} cxd4 4. cxd4 {The c-file has been opened but neither side has developed enough to make use of it.  Remember that 1. e4 robbed the d4 of any pawn support from the e-file.  White's contiuation has robbed the d4 square of any pawn support from the c-file as well.  White has his pawn duo, but can it be maintained?} d5 {The most aggressive continuation.  An exchange of pawns would leave White with an isolated d-pawn.} 5. e5 {The advance 5. e5 gains some space for white (notice that the king knight's favorite square f6 is off limits) at the cost of a tempo.  Also notice that of the four central squares three of them are occupied by pawns.  Occupation is not the same as control.  The only central square avaible for the pieces is e4.  White has no pawn that can fight for control over e4, while black has two.} Bg7 {Continuing his development.  If black can break up the mini pawn chain d4-e5, the bishop will become stronger.} 6. f4 {If white wishes to maintain the pawn chain, he must support it with his f-pawn.  It costs another tempo to do so however.} h5 {Black wants to transfer the knight on g8 to f5 via h6.  Once it gets to f5, it will be clear why h5 was useful.} 7. Nf3 {White has to try to complete his development.} Nh6 {Transferring the knight.} 8. Bd3 Nc6 {Developing with an eye on d4.} 9. Nc3 {Developing with an eye on d5.} Nf5 {Now it is clear why black played 6. ...h5.  It prevents white from playing 10. g4 to drive the knight away.  From its perch on f5 the knight increases the pressure on d4.} 10. Bxf5 {A serious concession.  White's center pawns are on dark squares.  White needs the light square bishop to complement them.  Without it, white will develop serious weaknesses on the light squares.} Bxf5 11. Bd2 {11.  Be3 was a better choice in order to defend the d4 pawn.} Bg4 {Indirectly pressuring the d4 square by pinning the knight that defends it.} 12. Qe2 {This loses material.} O-O {Black, in no hurry, secures his king prior to initiating any complications.} 13. O-O-O {The king is not exactly safe on the queenside, but his king side pawns are going to be compromised in a moment.} Nxd4 {Black wins material and causes structural damage.} 14. Qe3 Bxf3 {Or 14. ...Nxf3 the choice is mostly one of taste.} 15. gxf3 Nf5 {I liked the knight on f5 even more than the bishop.} 16. Qc5 e6 {Black's advantage has been consolidated.  He now needs to develop his rooks and queen and transfer the bishop back to the f8-a3 diagonal.} 17. Kb1 {Bringing the king to relative safety.} Qd7 {Preparing to occupy the c-file with his rooks.} 18. Nb5 {White will be driven back quickly.} Rfc8 {Gaining the file with tempo.} 19. Qb4 Bf8 {Redirecting the bishop with tempo.} 20. Qb3 a6 {Driving the knight away.} 21. Nc3 {It's instructive to go back to the position before white's 18th move.  It is the same for white except that the queen has moved from c5 to b3.  In the meantime, black has move Rfc8, Bf8 and a6, and it is his turn to play!} Nd4 {Too hasty.  21. ...b5 was better.} 22. Qa4 {22. Qd3 was a bit better, because all endings are in black's favor.} Qxa4 23. Nxa4 Rc6 {Covering the b6 square, preparing to double rooks on the c-file and b5 to drive the knight away.} 24. Rhf1 {Guarding the f-pawn, but rooks do not like pawn guard duty.} Rac8 {Taking control over the file.} 25. Nc3 b5 26. Be3 Nf5 27. Bd4 {The passive bishop would love to sacrifice itself for black's active knight, but black isn't interested in the exchange.} Rc6c4 {He would like to win it though.} 28. Bb6 Rxf4 {One of the two crippled f-pawns finally falls.} 29. Ne2 Rfc4 30. Rd2 Rc8c6 31. b3 {Although the rook has nowhere to go on the c-file it can transfer itself along the rank.} Rh4 {There is now a double attack.  One rook attacks the pawn on h2, while the other attacks the bishop on b6.} 32. Rf2 {White protects the wrong one.} Rxb6 {0-1  White resigns.  This game featured an attempt to establish a strong pawn center by white.  Black attacked it and fixed the pawns on dark squares.  Black then used the light squares c6 and f5 to attack the weak pawn on d4.  White tried to reduce the pressure with 10. Bxf5, but this left him vulnerable on the light squares.  Black continued to pressure d4 until he was able to win it.  He then consolidated and developed often at white's expense.  He then used the open cifile to penetrate white's terriitory along yet another light square (c4).  White's remianing kingside pawns where crippled and unlimately had to fall.  If you're pawns are on dark squares keep your light square bishop.  And vice-versa.}
