1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d5 3. e3 Bf5 4. Nd2 h6 5. h3 e6 6. Ngf3 c5 7. c3 Nc6 8. Be2 a6 {Until now , I like my position , my pieces developed well , the character of the opening doesn't make serious problems for black ,and I don't see how white is going to find a way of create any serious weakens or develop a powerful attack on my king .whites position also fine here , he have a strong pawn structure and he finished his development very fast ,and as I was playing with the black Pisces I also couldn't find an immediate plane to equal the game with more comfy position or get better position here . some masters and even IM's told me that a very strong player in the level of GM who plays this opening as white  , if he wants the game will be finished in a draw , he will do it with no problem .} 9. O-O c4 {It is similar in positions like Queens gambit , french defense , ext ext ... , which black try to get some space in the queens side and limit whites light Pisces moves for example ,Nd2 cant move to b3 and than to c5, and Black is un able  to move to d3 to challenge the black bishop on f5 (after the knight moves from d2) , however that kind of move have some disadvantages like it puts down the attention of whites pawn center and its going to be very hard to break it , and another thing is that I made this move to soon , it was better to finish my development first and protect my king .} 10. b3 {After blacks 9...c4 , black create some strong pawn structure on the queen side , (e6-d5-c4) and the idea of 10.b3 is to break this structure , there are some rules in chess that explain how to destroy opponents pawn structure and the best way is from the base of the structure like a house which you about to destroy , you strike in the base of the house first , in this case is to attack f7or e6 pawn , but this is impossible here at the moment , so the other possibility is to attack the first pawn in front which is c4 , usually in order to break pawn structure or ''pawn chain '' we use it in Russian or Hebrew we attack it by pawns only . another idea is to open the B file for the rook .the problem with the 10.b3 move that it creates weakness on the dark squares on whites queens side .} b5 {The idea is to defend c4 pawn and keep the powerful ''chain'' on the queens side , and here I started to wonder if  I will be good here when my king is still un protected . } 11. Ne5 {good move , after white accomplished his development , protected his king , white starts to invade blacks camp ,black doesn't have time to finish his development (move out his bishop on f8) because of the black knight on c6 which his under attack, and now the other knight can go to f3 followed by Qd2 Bh2 g4 f4 .... it seems that whites attacking plane on the king side is starting to be clear when the black king stuck on the center .} Nxe5 12. Bxe5 {Maybe 11...Qb6 was better with the idea of protect the knight on c6 and than Be7 and finally 0-0 and move out the king from the center , and if 12.Nxc6-Qxc6 13.Nf3-Ba3 with the idea of Bb2 and the white rook will be trapped . } Ba3 {As I say  before the idea of 12..Ba3 is 13...Bb2 and trap the rook on a1 , although it seems that white cant do much to stop that , white find a nice way to start a very power full attack because of the fact that blacks king still on the center . by the way that I didn't mention is the another idea of 12...Ba3 is to make room for castling and may be the reason that i didn't castled is that  I thought that whites compensation for the exchange will be not enough and I was wrong .} 13. bxc4 {good move , white cant avoid blacks threat Bb2 , so he starts capturing some pawns instead , not only he breaks my chain , and even capturing my bishop for his rook , the position starts to be exposed .and the black king is going to suffer , here I was starting  to deep thinking , I saw that if I will wait with 13..Bb2 and move 13...dxc (not 13...bxc .14.Qa4+followed by Qxa3 and I lost a piece) I realised that after 14.Bf3 -Rc8 (14...Nd5 .15.e4 and whites forks the bishop and the knight ,and the  rook can retreat from the attack to b1) now white can decide between 15.Bb7 and do the same thing that I was going to do in the first place , trapping the rook or 15.e4 attacking the bishop on f5 and close the diagonal h7-b1 which gives white rook an escape sqaure on b1 .  } Bb2 {Maybe that was a mistake ,trapping the rook was the beginning for the end to my position , the fact of the poor position of my king and my broken queen side gives the idea that blacks exchange advantage is irrelevant . better was 13...0-0 .14.cxb-axb.15.Bxb5-Bb2.16.Bc6 -Ra7 would still give White a nice compensation but here at least I could have some use the fact that exchange advantage it is still vital .} 14. cxb5 Bxa1 15. Qa4 {white even doesnt capture the bishop , the threat is 16.b6+Kf8(16...Qd7.17.b7-Rb8.18.Qxd7+Kxd719.Bxb8-Bxc3.20.Be5-Bxd2.21.b8 Q-Rxb8.22.Bxb8 or 19...Rxb8.20.Rxa1 ... if 17....Qxa4?.18.bxa Q+Ke7.19.Qxh8 ....} Bxc3 {One mistake leads to another !! better was 15...0-0.16.Rxa1-Qd7.17.Rb1-Ne4...with unclear position .} 16. bxa6+ Nd7 {16...Kf8 also a playble , but I wanted to keep my castleing chancses,and in case of 17.Bxg7-Rg8 following by Bxh3..., I was also peparring the move f6 Kf7 Re8 Kg8 . } 17. Nb1 Bxb1 18. Bxg7 {It's looks funny that instead of capturing piesces white capturing pawns , however both of the black piesces are under attack .which piesc Black should give back ? well  it is logical to keep the stronger and lose the weaker , the rook is better than a bishop , but after I made up my mind , I understood that I made the wrong descision . I should gave up my rook and retreat with my bishop to g6 withthe idea to keep out the white rook from b1 and stop it to invade to my 7th rank .} Rg8 19. Rxb1 Rxg7 20. Rb7 f6 21. Qc6 {Attacking the bishop on c3 and the pawn on e6 .} Rc8 22. Qxe6+ Kf8 23. Qd6+ Re7 24. Bb5 {Attacking the knight which its pined to protect f6 pawn , It is amazing that even black have big materiel advantage , a rook and a knight vs 4 pawns , black can do nothing to use it . } Ke8 25. Qxf6 Rf7 {Black must trade queens , and maybe give up  a piesce for the passing pawn a , thats the only way to survive the attack .} 26. Qe6+ Kf8 {the only right move , not 26...Re7??.27.Qg8#, and if 26...Qe7.27.Bxd7+and black is losing evrything .} 27. Qxh6+ {Black resigns ... I couldn't take it any longer , because of the fact that I was going to lose all my pawns one by one , I didn't see any way how to stop the a pawn advancing to queen with out losing big material . I felt simply lost here , what could black do here ? if 27...Rg7.28.Rxd7 attacking the queen and the pined rook on g7 , if 27...Ke8.28.Qe6+Kf8.29.Bxd7, 28...Qe7.29.Bxd7+, 27...Re7??.28.Qg8# , 27...Kg8.28.Qg6+Re7.29.Qe6+Kf8.30.Bxd7...and , thank you hope you enjoy the game , remember , losing it is also part of the game , but the important thing is to learn from my mistakes and always try to find when I can do better next time ,  this lose was very pain full but it showed me that I should not always hurry to make moves with out checking 100 times that it will be OK , I always need to take care of my king firs and than attack latter if I can , and analyse the position more carefully and if it takes spend more time , thank you :)}
