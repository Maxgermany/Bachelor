[Opening "Vienna game (C25)"]

1. e4 {I had white pieces and started with e4.} e5 2. Nc3 {After e5, I decided to play Nc3, going for Vienna opening.} Bc5 {Bc5, this is not the most accurate move in this position, better moves would be Nc6, Nf6 or Bb4.} 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nd5 {After Bc4, Nf6, Nd5 was played. This move sets up the trap - white is now challenging black's knight on f6 and leaves the e pawn undefended, if black takes the e pawn then he would be in trouble.} Nxe4 {Black takes the bait with his knight, and threatens Nxf2 forking white's queen and rook.} 5. Qg4 {Qg4, forking black's knight and g pawn, leaving the f2 pawn hanging.} Nxf2 {Black happily captured the f pawn, he is now two pawns up and his knight is now forking my queen and rook. } 6. Qxg7 {Qxg7, white queen is now attacking black's rook.} Rf8 {Black thought that my rook on h1 is trapped, so there is no rush to take it straight away, thus he defended his rook first with Rf8. However, he totally overlooked my next move.} 7. Qxe5+ {Qxe5+!, Black now has two options, he can block the check with either Qe7 or Be7, unfortunately either move would lead to disaster. } Be7 {Black decided to save his beloved queen, and played Be7. He totally missed my next move. What did he miss? Can you find the next move for white?} 8. Nf6# {Kaboom! Nf6 checkmate! This trap perfectly demonstrated that you should never be greedy, especially during the opening. I hope you enjoyed reading this annotation, please feel free to leave your comments. I wish you good luck with your games, and see you next time.}
