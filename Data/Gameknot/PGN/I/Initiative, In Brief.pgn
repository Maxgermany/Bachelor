[Opening "Latvian (C40), Fraser defence"]

1. e4 {Hi all! This is a recent miniature--in the Latvian Gambit; I know; you're shocked. It's another example of an interesting deviation in the Fraser Variation (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5?! 3.Nxe5 Nc6?!), where we get into uncharted territory quickly and explore this strange line, where White grabs an extra pawn and Black attempts to make him pay. In this case, Black's spacious kingside and dramatic developmental advantage prove overwhelming with surprising swiftness. Some of the analysis is extremely long; I highly recommend using the interactive viewer since the one-page scrolling one doesn't display line breaks. Enjoy!} e5 2. Nf3 f5 {?! The Latvian Gambit. Generally considered somewhat dubious, Black gives up a pawn and generally much more in exchange for open lines of attack and a lead in development.} 3. Nxe5 {This is the main line. I'm not going to spend much time on the opening variations; I have several other annotated games that go into the main lines in more depth.} Nc6 {?! Standard is 3.Qf6 or 3.Nf6; the text is called the Fraser Variation, and is an attempt to draw White off the main line. I've favored it recently especially because finding the time to develop this Knight otherwise can be tricky.} 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Nxg6 Nf6 6. Qxf5 {?! I've encountered this a couple of times recently, but I don't know of any theory that supports it or even mentions it. The standard move is 6.Qh3 or 6.Qh4, but the "free" f-pawn is tempting. It is also, I think, poisoned, as it gives Black a strong initiative with which to regain his material while developing and chasing the WQ around the board.} d5 7. Qg5 {? 7.Qf3 (...Bg4 8.Qb3) or 7.Qf4 are probably better, as they don't invite the Black Rook onto the half-open g-file.} Rg8 8. exd5 Rxg6 {The only reasonable move; anything else allows White to keep his Knight.} 9. Qe3+ Ne7 10. Bd3 {? 10.Nc3 or 10.Bc4 are probably better. This just makes developing harder.} Nfxd5 {? This actually fails to 11.Bxg6+ hxg6. 10...Rxg2 was almost certainly better.} 11. Qf3 {11.Bxg6+! was correct.} Bg4 {? Continuing to not notice that Bxg6 is check, Black chooses to set up a short combination meant to essentially finish development and prepare for castling with ...Bf5 and ...Qd7, while keeping the initiative and the powerful Rg6.} 12. Qg3 Bf5 13. Qf3 Qd7 14. Bxf5 {After 14.Bxf5 Nxf5, I'm afraid my analysis goes too long for GK's annotation box, so it will be split up over this move and the next. Look at Black's fantastic development compared to White's single piece off its home square (after 15...Nxf5). Materially, the players are about even (with White having three pawns for a Knight), but positionally, it's not even close. Black owns the entire center of the board and is ready to castle; White has many moves to go before his pieces can be brought to bear, but he desperately needs the to weather the coming onslaught of Black forces.  As White has a free tempo here and a lot that he needs to get done, I think it's worth taking a look at his needs and his options. First, while Black doesn't have any immediate threats and may castle next move, giving White another tempo to use, it's worth noting that Black certainly isn't under any *pressure* to castle, and may instead play something like 15...Bc5, 15...Nd4 or 15...Re6+, or 15...Nh4. The first is probably not serious enough to warrant slacking in development; the second means that (A) 15.Na3 should be considered; the third should be seriously considered in all variations, and the last should be able to be dealt with by 16.Rg1 or a preemptive (B) 15.g3. White's own goals should be to get castled and get his queenside developed as fast as possible. The main options along these lines are (C) 15.O-O, (D) 15.d3, (E) 15.b3, and (F) 15.Nc3.  (A) 15.Na3 is a somewhat awkward developing move, but it is also the best way to defend the vulnerable c2 square, which could come under fire via ...Nb4 or ...Nd4 (note that White cannot win a Knight (unless 15.O-O) with 15...Nb4 16.Qe3+?? because of 16...Re6!). From a3, the Knight doesn't have much scope, but it keeps the BQ off b5 and may jump up to c4 a little later. This is not bad at all, though it means White would have to respond to 15...Re6+ by moving the King, which is not ideal.  (B) 15.g3 is meant to protect h4 from a marauding Black Knight intent on winning the g-pawn with check. This is certainly a significant threat as playing some other move means that 15...Nh4 results in 16...Nxg2+ (or 16...Rxg2+ if White played 15.O-O) and an ugly situation for White. So *not* playing 15.g3 looks somewhat dangerous, but what about the move itself? Well, it offers no protection against 15...Re6+, which would force White to respond with a King move and loss of castling privileges--definitely a downside. 15.g3 also creates big weaknesses on f3 and h3 which cannot be shored up by a Bishop, and does not contribute to White's development--both big concerns, given that consolidation and motion have to be White's top priorities.} Nxf5 {(C) 15.O-O looks okay at first glance, as it gets the WK out of immediate danger, allows the WQ to go back onto the e-file if desired, avoids 15...Re6+, and develops the KR. However, this also pins the g-pawn, and Black has terrific mobility and all the open files he could want on the kingside. After 15...O-O-O, he'll be threatening a devastating 16...Nh4! to which I don't see a satisfactory defense. To be frank, I think White should be rushing to the queenside, as the this move looks like castling into a firestorm.  (D) 15.d3 looks good at first glance: it allows the Bishop to move, even allowing it to interpose against 15...Re6+ on e3. However, there is a terrible flaw: it takes the d3 stop from the WQ, making 15...Nd4! a devastating move. White's only choice is 16.Qd1, and then he has every single piece on their home squares sixteen moves into the game, and the Bishop isn't even useful anymore again 16...Re6+ 17.Be3 Nxe3!. This seemingly-practical move, then, must not be played.  (E) 15.b3 is a decent choice, though it suffers the same problems that 15.g3 does in that it does nothing about any of Black's threats. It does allow the Bishop to develop without the catastrophic effects of 15.d3, though, and will allow an eventual long-hand castling once the WK is forced to move, via Kd1-c1-b2-Rd1.  (F) 15.Nc3 has the fantastic effects of developing a piece, making a claim on the center, offering a trade, and even being a reasonably adequate defense against all of Black's threats. For instance, White can now respond to 15...Nh4 with 16.Qe2+!? (Re6 17.Ne4 Nf6 18.d3 etc), and similar defenses against 15...Re6+ and 15...Nd4. 15...Nxc3 16.dxc3 seems to be fine as well, though White will still lose his ability to castle after 16...Nh4, but now Black's attack has lost a bit of steam and White should manage to hold. As the only move that can claim all this, I certainly have to conclude that 15.Nc3 is White's best move under the circumstances.} 15. O-O {? See the huge analysis in the two previous moves for why I think 15.Nc3 was the correct move here, and why this one was particularly bad. Now, if Black plays accurately, White will have little or no time to get any of his other pieces activated for the defense of his King.} O-O-O 16. g3 Nh4 {! No less brutal for the g3 push. Besides the obvious threat to the WQ, a mating net is tightening around the WK with the threat of 17...Qh3 and 18...Qg2#. There are only two moves that fail to lose right away: the WQ must stay on the h1-a8 diagonal to defend g2, so White may play (A) 17.Qh1 or (B) 17.Qe4.  (A) 17.Qh1 looks SO ugly for White. It certainly defends g2, but it also leaves the WK with no moves, which is a dangerous place to be with all this artillery bearing down. Black has a lot of choices here (truly, he can do whatever he wants), but the main things to consider are in these categories: (i) bring more pieces to bear, (ii) get the Queen to h3, and (iii) put a Knight on f4, threatening mate on h3 or e2.  (i) After 17.Qh1, putting more pressure on the White position seems like a solid plan. Specifically, Black's Bishop could be more active, either on h6 or c5. ...Bb4 is an option as well, glaring at e1--where White wants to put a Rook soon--and may also capture a Nc3. So Bb4 may be strong in preparation for ...Nf4, since it indirectly defends e2. Bh6 does much the same in a different manner: it defends f4 directly, so that White cannot eliminate the Knight there (17...Bh6 18.d3 Bxc1 19.Rxc1 Nf4 looks very good for Black). 17...Bc5 is not as clear, but it suggests 18...Rf8, where White's f-pawn is hard to defend. These all look pretty good for Black, with no obvious refutation.  (ii) 17.Qh1 Qh3 looks dangerous for White, but after some consideration, it's actually not terrible--the WQ literally *can't* move off the h1-a8 diagonal, so ...Qg2 isn't a threat. The main benefit to 17...Qh3 seems to be that White can't play 18.h3 to give his King some breathing room and potentially slip out of the pin. It does give White some tempo to play d2-d3 or even d2-d4, and seems to require a following Bishop-move to really be effective. Despite how forceful this looks, it seems to be more of a long-term goal and passive threat--the Queen is more useful on d7, where she has more options.  (iii) 17.Qh1 Nf4 is certainly the most forceful possibility. Black threatens immediate mate on e2 or h3, so there are exactly three possible moves for White: 18.Re1, 18.Qe4, and 18.h3 (okay, technically 18.Rd1 is not immediately fatal, but it's inferior to 18.Re1). 18.Re1 looks potentially okay for a minute: 18...Nh3+ 19.Kf1 Qb5+ 20.Re2 (20.d3 Rxd3! and White is lost) 20...Re8 looks bad, but maybe the WK can make it to the queenside. Note that gxh4?? remains impossible this whole time because of ...Rg1+, winning the WQ. Alternately, 18.h3 seems to fall flat against 18...Nxh3+ 19.Kh2 Bd6!, and 18.Qe4 is met by 18...Qg4 19.Kh1 Qg3 20.Re1 Nf3! 21.Qxf3 Rh6.  (B) 17.Qe4 looks to give Black a little less to work with. His Knight is now actually threatened, and the strongest way to defend it seems to be 17...Qh3, allowing White a tempo for 18.d3 (or 18.d4) or 18.Nc3, so that after 18...Rg4 19.Qh1, at least White will be slightly better off with an extra move under his belt.} 17. Qh1 {? See above for variations; 17.Qe4 was better.} Nf4 {0-1. White's had enough. As I mentioned above, White can maybe hold here with 18.Re1, but it's ugly and dangerous and Black's pieces are so much more energetic that the situation is probably hopeless, realistically. I hope you enjoyed this brief game: exploring the results after 6.Qxf5?! is convincing me more and more that the initiative afforded Black in this line is simply too large an advantage for the pawn to be worth it.  Many thanks to mischo for the game! Any comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated; if you leave a rating please also let me know what I did well or need to improve. Thanks for reading!}
