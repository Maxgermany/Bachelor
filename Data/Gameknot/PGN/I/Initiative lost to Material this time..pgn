1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Qh4 {This defense to the Scotch Game has had a better reputation in the past. These days, it's considered not so good for Black. But I'm thinking of using it in a tournament against a Scotch player who's unprepared for it and wanted to test it out.} 5. Nf3 {The common moves are Nc3, where White tries to hold on to the pawn, and Nb5, where White gets the pawn but Black gives up the right to castle.  I felt that this was a mistake because Black gets the pawn and still gets to castle. But it turns out not so easy to castle, even here.} Qxe4+ 6. Be2 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 {I was in a hurry to develop and get my king out of the center. You've got to castle rapidly in an open game. I think I was more worried that he would play c3 here, and I'd have to move the bishop again instead of developing the knight next or Nbd2 -- probably the best move -- and make me take a move with the queen. Though, I know the queen can't stay out in the middle of the board like this.} Nf6 8. O-O {Hard decision for me. Do I trade on c6 so I can castle or move the queen?} Qe7 9. Bg5 {White continues to make it hard for me. I'm worried about White playing Ne4.} Bxc3 10. bxc3 O-O 11. Rb1 {I think that's a wonderful move for White. I still want to play d6 or d5, but it just got harder to develop the light bishop. It also lets the rook develop quickly to the kingside.} h6 12. Bh4 {Yeah, I was hoping for the trade, but he didn't go for it. That means I have to keep going.} g5 {I'm already up a pawn, but I still had a nervous feeling that White might sac a piece for two pawns and then swing the rook over to the kingside and the queen via d3 perhaps. I've ahead in material but still far behind in initiative.} 13. Bg3 Ne4 {I want to get rid of his bishop pair and reduce the number of pieces he has attacking me.} 14. Bxc7 {That's a shock. The first thing I was worried about was Bd6. But then I see that I'll be okay. I can play Nxc3. He can play Bd6, but I'll move my queen to f6. He can move his queen, but I don't have to settle for a rook trade. I can play Nxe2+ and then Qxd6 after he plays Qxe2.} Nxc3 15. Qd2 {Instead of winning the exchange on b1, I decided it's better to get a bishop or more.} Nxe2+ 16. Kh1 d5 17. Rbe1 {Not a good move. Rescuing the bishop would be better. And if you want to pin the knight, I think using the other rook is better. The rook on b1 was one of the few good things left for White.} Qxc7 {Now Black's up a piece and a pawn, and the rest should be easy.} 18. Qxe2 {Rxe2 is probably better to double the rooks and not have the knight pinned  on the next move.} Bg4 19. Qe5 {That's just a plain blunder, but the game is already over for White.} Nxe5 20. Rxe5 Bxf3 21. Rf5 {This move traps the rook.} Be4 22. Rf3 Bxf3 23. gxf3 Rae8 24. Rg1 Re2 25. Rg2 Qf4 26. a3 Qxf3 27. Kg1 Re1# {}
