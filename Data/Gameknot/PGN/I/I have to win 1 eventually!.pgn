1. d4 f5 {Dutch Defence... why not.} 2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 e6 4. a3 Nc6 {I was kind of going for the Stonewall, mostly because when I read about it I thought it was a cool name. Except Nc6 kind of mucked it up.} 5. Bg5 Be7 {I agonised after this for a while, because I really didn't want him to trade out the black bishops.} 6. Qd2 Nf6 {Thankfully for my black bishop I can get my knight in there. It looks like a horrible pin, but I'm ok with it.} 7. e3 {Opening up his white bishop.} Na5 {Normally I'd avoid sending my knights out to the edge of the board, but here I'm aiming for Nc4.} 8. Ne5 {Ah yes... anything on e5 was always going to be a problem...} c6 9. Bd3 {It's here that I realise that my knight on a5 is stranded once he plays b4. Need an escape route.} b5 {Look at all those pawns} 10. b4 Nc4 11. Bxc4 bxc4 12. Nxc6 {It was either lose that pawn or lose my knight for nothing.  I'll be -1 for quite some time now...} Qc7 13. Ne5 a5 14. b5 {Ah the b pawn... we develop a hate-hate relationship in this game.} Bd7 15. a4 O-O 16. h3 Bb4 {This bishop has his knight pinned to his queen. What's more, the knight can't be backed up by anything else so the queen can't move either without giving up the knight for free. So I'm pretty pleased with that.} 17. f3 Be8 18. O-O h6 19. Bf4 g5 20. Bh2 {Him moving that knight will reveal an attack no my queen. Need to do something about it} Qg7 21. e4 {hmmm... pretty sure I have to take it, but from which side? I choose dxe4 because I want my f pawn to stay where it is. This gives away my pawn on c5 though... However - he has a real problem when I play Ne4 that forks his queen and knight pinned on c3.} dxe4 22. fxe4 Nxe4 23. Qe2 Bxc3 {and there it is.} 24. Rad1 Rc8 25. Nxc4 Bf7 {Little did I realise I have just blocked in my queen...} 26. Be5 {This is a great move from Aleks that I didn't see. Very few places for my queen to go. I decide to stay on the 7 row so that I can still slide back out again later.} Qh7 27. Qd3 Bb4 {Bringing the bishop back so my knight is free to move again.} 28. b6 {Gah, that b pawn! I didn't see that coming at the time; I was expecting him to be more concerned about my knight. If I'm not careful that b pawn will go all the way or kill one of my rooks.} Be8 29. Rda1 {It looks like my bishop was after the a pawn, but really I just wanted to get my queen back out.} Qb7 30. Rfd1 Rf7 31. Bc7 {Another great move from Aleks. I am very tempted to trade out a rook for bishop+pawn and just be done with it. But I don't...} Bc6 32. Ne5 Nc3 {Things are getting a little hairy...  (I think this move of mine is a mistake, since I can't really take his rook: ie, 33. Nxf7, Nxd1. Nxh6+. I wouldn't get the knight until after it has decimated the pawns around my king)} 33. Nxf7 Kxf7 {So I choose to accept my mistake and move on. Though I'm still fairly pleased with my attacking options here with my bishop and queen lined up the big diagonal.} 34. Rdf1 Be4 35. Qc4 Nd5 {I like this move as I can now be sure to kill off that annoying b pawn.} 36. Qe2 Nxc7 37. bxc7 Qxc7 {I take with the queen so that I'm lined up to capture the pawn on c2, as well as having an option to charge straight into g3 and put him on the defensive. (Take a moment to see the important thing that I've missed...)} 38. Qxe4 {Dang! I hadn't seen that coming. The pawn is pinned to the king, and on the previous turn it wasn't an issue because my queen was backing up the bishop.} Bd6 39. Rab1 Qxc2 {Queen trade? I'm hoping that my extra pawn, 4 of them connected, are enough to out play his 2 rooks.} 40. Qxc2 Rxc2 41. Rb5 Bb4 {Back to my favourite outpost} 42. d5 {I have few useful moves here, since I'm likely to start bleeding pawns.} Bc5+ {I'm giving up my a5 pawn to try to keep more of the connected ones.} 43. Kh1 Kf6 44. Rd1 exd5 {Well this is interesting... If Aleks takes that pawn then my rook will Rc1+, and he has pretty much forced move 46. Kh2. (He could interpose the rook but it would be futile). I follow that up with Bg1+ and if he tries to flee to the middle I get checkmate: 47. Kg3 Rc3+ 48. Rd3 Rxd3#. His other option is 47. Kh1 where I can play for a 3 move repetition.} 45. Rxd5 {Bingo!} Rc1+ 46. Kh2 Bg1+ 47. Kg3 Rc3+ 48. Rd3 Rxd3# {}
