1. d4 {Here is a team game I just completed, and it was one of the hardest fought games I've had in a while. It was a very positional type game, and with the white pieces I establish what I considered to be a very favorable position with two handsomely posted pieces. While the board was somewhat locked down, I felt that I had a nice space advantage and the more active pieces. The main problem was that I just couldn't seem to break through. My opponent, who was apparently playing off of his heels heading into and during the middlegame, fights back very admirably and has me on the very unexpected defensive. He ends up pushing a pawn down my throat that forces me to lose my last piece defending against his promotion. The real beauty of the position is that while I am down a piece, that piece is a bishop, and as you know lone bishops can be dodged by a crafty king. My king runs an end sweep around his remaining pawns, and ends up trapping the enemy king! This really is a pretty nifty draw - I hope you enjoy:)} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 dxc4 {Queen's Gambit Accepted.} 4. Qa4+ {Immediately regaining the gambit pawn.} c6 {A Slav type response that bolsters d5.} 5. Qxc4 e6 {?! I guess it's a matter of style, but I really prefer bringing the c8 bishop to f5 first, so as to not block it in.} 6. a3 {?! Maybe not the most economical as it does not develop, but in QGA positions black's dark squared bishop can cause white some headaches.} b5 {?! Way aggressive. Black chases the white queen with a non developing pawn thrust. Black now has a backward c pawn and a potentially ugly looking pawn chain on the queenside.} 7. Qd3 h6 {?! Black continues to confound me by not developing a piece.} 8. e4 {Since the center is available, white claims it.} Qa5+ {Black throws a misguided check that is easily repelled.} 9. Bd2 {Counter punching the intruder with development.} Qc7 10. Nc3 a6 {Black is allowing white entirely too much time to develop with these pawn moves.} 11. Rc1 {! Rook to half open file which targets the backward pawn and X-rays the enemy queen.} Be7 {Black finally gets into gear and prepares to castle.} 12. Be2 {Last piece developed.} Bd7 13. O-O O-O 14. e5 {Intruding into enemy territory and keeping lanes open towards the enemy's castled position.} Nd5 {Black moves to safety and offers to exchange knights.} 15. Ne4 {! As exchanging the knight would only help black, white eyes the nice hole on c5.} f5 {This move forces white to do what he was going to do anyway, which is nab the outpost.} 16. Nc5 Bxc5 {Bishop for knight, but black just couldn't allow that knight such a cushy outpost.} 17. Rxc5 Nb6 {?! Black leaves a strong square. What is he up to?} 18. b3 {He was eying c4 of course, and white protects that square.} Be8 {Opening a square for the Nb8.} 19. Ba5 Nb8d7 20. Rc2 {Saving the rook while keeping the file with plans to double up on it.} Kh7 {By this point, I had almost given up on trying to figure out black's plan. While certanly not in a horrible position so far, black continues to allow white time to become even more active. Maybe my opponent is just a better locked pawns/positional type of player. I really don't know, so I just continue to make what I consider sound developing moves.} 21. Rfc1 {Loading up on the c file with plans for Ne1 followed by f4.} Nb8 {hmmmmm..........................no idea.} 22. Ne1 Bg6 {Hoping for a chance to play 23...f4!} 23. f4 {As planned.} Be8 24. Bb4 {Eying the nice d6 post.} Rg8 25. Bf3 Nd5 {Black returns to the strong d5 square.} 26. Bd6 Qc8 27. g3 {Protecting f4 while creating more space for the light squared bishop.} g6 28. Ng2 h5 29. Ne1 {? Wasted move. White probably should have played Ne3 and tried to trade off for black's strong Nd5.} Kh6 30. h4 {White now supports a second tasty looking outpost on g5.} Bd7 31. Bg2 Rg7 32. Nf3 Rg8 {? Another wasted move.} 33. Ng5 {Ok - white has achieved two very strong outposts and controls more real estate than black. Black is cramped and very under-developed. I gotta admit, I was feeling pretty confident at this point. The issue at hand now is to find a way to take advantage!} Re8 34. Bc5 Kg7 35. Bf3 a5 {! Black has only one real area of opportunity, so he presses it. The Nb8 now has a square to develop to. The next sequence of moves turns out to be pretty advantageous to black. There are 12 exchanges over the next 9 moves that brings black right back into the game. In replaying this game, I simply can't believe how I let such a promising position get flushed right down the toilet. Many congratulations to ricardopr for engineering the bloodbath which follows! It really is pretty awesome......} 36. Bd6 Na6 37. b4 {? This turns out to be a horrible choice, as it allows the carnage to follow.} axb4 {! White has the chance to activate his Ra8 down the a file while itching for action on b4.} 38. Bxd5 {Removing the powerful knight.} exd5 39. axb4 {? Another horrible move by white. Black can now get vertical on the a file.} Rb8 {!! Outstanding tactic! Black sacs a rook in return for a very strong knight fork. It is worthy to note the backward c pawn that black has had for the whole game is now potentially very strong once the white bishop is off of the board.} 40. Bxb8 {? I fall for the trap, and get punished severely for it.} Nxb4 {! Of course.} 41. Qxb5 {! White responds with a strong tactic of his own!} cxb5 {Just keep an eye on this pawn. What was once a backward pawn is now a passed pawn that will dictate the game! Amazing transformation!} 42. Rc2xc8 Rxc8 43. Rxc8 Bxc8 44. Bd6 {Lo and behold we are now back to equal material, but black is now better positionally due to his passed pawn! The saving grace for white is that his pawns are ALL on opposite colored squares than the enemy bishop, so white is not at all reluctant to trade off his bishop for black's powerful knight.} Nc2 {Naturally black sees this, and will not allow it.} 45. Bc5 {d4 (as well as all pawns) must be protected while black has a knight on the board.} b4 {Passed pawns must naturally be pushed.} 46. Nf3 {Rushing to try to pick off the passer.} b3 47. Nd2 b2 48. Nb1 {Ok - white is gonna have to get his king active and moving towards the action.} Kf7 {As is black.} 49. Ba3 {? I lose touch with all reality. This was the worst possible move I could have made. So of course I made it. Black can now promote, and trade knight and pawn for knight and bishop.} Nxa3 50. Nxa3 Ba6 {You know he is going to d3.} 51. Kf2 {The white king is just one square too far away to guard d3.} Bd3 52. Ke3 b1=Q 53. Nxb1 Bxb1 54. Kd2 {White is totally demoralized after blowing such a beautiful middle game advantage, and realistically can only hope to salvage a draw. If my pawns were on white squares I would have resigned at this point, but since they are all safe from the enemy bishop, perhaps I can race around the queenside and lock in the black king behind his own position.} Be4 {? Although a little tough to tell, this move helps to blow the win for black. If 54...Ke7 then black could head off having to protect the crucial c7 square. Why is c7 important? Let's take a look................} 55. Kc3 Ke7 56. Kb4 Bd3 {? Again, black does white a favor by not moving his king towards the queenside.} 57. Ka5 {It's all square counting now. } Kd7 58. Kb6 Bc4 {Obviously 58...Kc8 gives white winning chances (black's g pawn becomes a target).} 59. Kb7 Bb5 60. Kb6 Bc4 61. Kb7 Ke7 {? Assures the draw for white.} 62. Kc7 {! Draw locked up. Black is now fully hemmed in behind his own pawns, and white can protect c7 from both b6 and b8.} Bb5 63. Kc8 Bd7+ {A frustration check that is easily sidestepped by returning to the righteous c7.} 64. Kc7 Be6 65. Kc6 Ke8 {Black tries another way....} 66. Kd6 {....but white threatens to gain material.} Kf7 67. Kc6 Ke7 68. Kc7 Bd7 69. Kb8 Bb5 70. Kc7 {I just love c7!} Be8 71. Kc8 Bd7+ 72. Kc7 Be8 73. Kc8 Bf7 74. Kc7 Be8 {And a draw was confirmed. I felt like I dodged a BIG bullet in this one.  Many thanks to ricardopr for the great game. It was one of the more interesting endgames I've had in a while, and a pretty instructional game about counting squares. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas}
