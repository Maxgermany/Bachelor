[Opening "QGD (D06), Marshall defence"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nf6 {This is called the Marshall Defense.  I don't like it for Black for reasons that we will soon see.  White to play.} 3. cxd5 {If 3... c6 4. Nc3 cxd5 5. Bf4 e6 (5... Bf5 6. Qb3) 6. e3 Bd6 7. Bxd6 Qxd6 8. Nf3  or 8. Rc1.} Qxd5 { } 4. Nc3 {If 4... Qa5 5. Bd2 e5 6. e4 c6 7. dxe5 Qxe5 8. f4.} Qd7 {This is a terrible spot for the queen.  This is the first of three key positions.} 5. e4 {White should have played 5. Nf3 first, which prevents Black from getting a pawn in the center.  Now Black is doing well after 5... e5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+.  If 6. d5 then 6... Bb4 7. f3 c6 and Black is slightly better.} a6 { } 6. Nf3 {If 6... e6 7. Bd3 b5 8. Be3 c5 9. dxc5 Ng4 10. Bf4 or 10. Qd2.  Then if 10... b4 11. Na4.} g6 { } 7. Ne5 Qd8 8. Bc4 {This forces Black to weaken his pawn structure.} e6 {Now Black has dark square weaknesses.} 9. Bg5 {If 9... Be7 10. d5 O-O 11. Bh6 Re8 12. O-O exd5 13. Nxd5 Be6 (13... Nxe4 14. Nxf7) 14. Qf3. } Nbd7 {A blunder.} 10. Nxd7 Bxd7 11. e5 Be7 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. exf6 Qxf6 14. O-O O-O-O {This is the second of three key positions.} 15. d5 {White is going to rid himself of his pawn weakness.  This also frees the White queen to go to b3.  If 15... b5? 16. Bd3 White is fine.  If Black were to pursue 16... exd5?! 17. Nxd5 Qxb2? 18. Rc1 or 18. Qf3 and Black has too many weaknesses.} h5 {Not particularly helpful.} 16. Qb3 exd5 {Makes things worse.} 17. Nxd5 Qd6 {I thought that this spot for the Queen was questionable, but computer analysis agrees with it.} 18. Rac1 {Black should play 18... Kb8 19. Nxc7 Qxc7 20. Bd5 Ba4 21. Qxa4, but White is still winning.} Be6 {This is the third key position. } 19. Rfd1 {Missing 19. Nxc7 Bxc4 20. Rxc4.  Now Black could play 19... Kb8 to which White would respond 20. Nc3, but not 20. Nxc7 Bxc4 21. Rxd6 Bxb3 22. Rxd8+ Rxd8 23. axb3 Rc8.} Qc6 {Possibly the worst move on the board. } 20. Ne7+ Kb8 21. Nxc6+ {And, of course, Black resigns.}
