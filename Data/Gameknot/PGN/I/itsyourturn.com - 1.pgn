[Opening "Polish defence (A40)"]

1. d4 b5 {A dubious opening move if there ever was one.  } 2. e4 Bb7 {White to play.} 3. Nd2 {Stockfish 9 prefers 3. Bxb5, but no doubt Black was prepared for that. } a6 4. a4 {Not really helpful.  } c6 5. Ngf3 e6 6. e5 {Better is 6. Bd3. } d6 7. Bd3 dxe5 8. Nxe5 {Now White is only slightly better after 8... Nd7.  If 8... Qxd4 then White has a better position after 9. Ndf3 or 9. Qe2.} c5 {A tactical mistake.  } 9. axb5 {If 9... Bxg2 10. Rg1 Bd5 11. bxa6 and White has a big edge.  White is significantly better after  9... cxd4 10. Qe2. For example Nf6 11. bxa6 Bd5 12. Bb5+ Nbd7 13. O-O.  White is also well off after 9... Qxd4 10. Ndf3 Qd6 11. bxa6 Rxa6 (11... Bxa6 12. Rxa6 Nxa6 13. Bb5+ Ke7 14. Qxd6+ Kxd6 15. Nxf7+) 12. Bb5+ Ke7 13. Qxd6+ Rxd6 14. Be3 Na6 15. O-O f6 16. Nc4.  } axb5 {Not seeing the disaster that is coming.  } 10. Rxa8 Bxa8 11. Bxb5+ Ke7 12. O-O Qc7 {Not as good as 12... f6. } 13. Qh5 g6 14. Qh4+ {If 14... Nf6 15. Nb3 and White is doing well.} f6 15. Nxg6+ hxg6 16. Qxh8 Nh6 17. Ne4 {Why give up this knight?} Bxe4 18. Bxh6 Bxh6 19. Ra1 {Both 19. Qxh6 and 19. Re1 are almost as good.} Bf4 {And now for the clever combination } 20. Ra7 {If 20... Bxh2+ 21. Qxh2 Qxa7 22. Qh7+.} Bb7 {This is worse than  20... Qxa7 21. Qg7+ Kd8 22. Qxa7.  } 21. Rxb7 {Black resigned because of 21... Qxb7 22. Qh7+ or Qg7+ winning the queen.}
