1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {Vienna game.} Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 {And now it is the four knights. Usually it is rather boring, but not in this game!} 4. Bc4 Bc5 5. a3 {?! Probably a bit of a wasted move.} d6 6. d3 O-O {This is a pretty dull position, hard to imagine how it will change.} 7. Ng5 h6 8. h4 {And... Boom. The 'boring' position is now not so boring.} hxg5 {?? Really bad decision. I thought I'd be okay since my knight prevents Qh5, but it wasn't enough.} 9. hxg5 Bg4 {And... BLUNDER! Allows him to win back his piece.} 10. f3 Nxe4 {No matter what I played, my knight would have to stop defending h5.} 11. dxe4 Bd7 12. f4 {Clearing the way for his queen.} g6 13. f5 {! Strong.} gxf5 {?? Should have created an escape route for my king by moving my rook.} 14. Qh5 {Nothing I can do.} Re8 15. Qh8# {Well done Jimrocks22!}
