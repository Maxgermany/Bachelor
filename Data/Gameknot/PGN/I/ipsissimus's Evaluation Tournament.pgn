1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Scotch} exd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 5. Be3 Qf6 {one of the most efficient lines for black} 6. c3 Qg6 {puting pressure on e4} 7. Nd2 {Defending e4} Nge7 8. g3 b6 9. Bg2 Bb7 10. O-O {Fianchoto built, white's developpement is completed.} Ne5 {To menace e4 with the LSB} 11. Qc2 {defending e4 and joining the rooks} O-O-O {Probably a strategical mistake, blac should have castled short as white has strong attacking possibilities on the queenside : he'll be dangerous quicker than black} 12. b4 {To fire the bishop off the long diagonal and advance toward the king.} Bd6 13. Qa4 {attacking the kingside. White has developpement advance and controls more space (having some control on 41 squares against 36 for black.} Kb8 14. Nb5 {White increases the pressure on the fiancheto} a6 {weakening the king but black had little othe choice} 15. Nxd6 {To eliminate one defender of the black king.} Qxd6 16. c4 {advancing toward the king.} Qc6 {menacing c4 and an attack on the long diagonal.} 17. Qb3 {Defending c4, setting the queen in front of the black king and making place for an advanc of the a pawn.} f5 {White cannot take but this move is of little advantage for black. 17. Ng6 might have been better} 18. a4 {reinforcing the attack.} g5 {mistake} 19. Bxg5 {menacing the e knight.} Rde8 20. b5 {The assault begins} Qg6 {The menace on g2 is over.} 21. Bf4 {menacing the knight so  that black has to defend it and setting the bishop on the black king's diagonal} Ng4 {It provides some countergame but the knight is far away of the black king. 21. f7 would have been better (to allow a further Nd6 or Nd8).} 22. bxa6 {Now white's attack cannot be stopped.} Bxa6 23. a5 Bb7 24. axb6 {Menacing 25. Bxc7+ or 25. exf5 or 25 bxc7 Kc8 26. Ra8+ Bxe8 27. Qb8 mate.} Qxb6 {Blunder but the game was anyway lost for black.} 25. Qxb6 {mate in 4. : 25. ... d6 26. Bxd6 cxd6 27. Rfb1 Kc8 28. Ra8+ Bxe8 29. Qxb8 mate.  The main mistake from Rakbeater is probably strategical : long castle and underestimating white's attacking possibilities on the queenside.}
