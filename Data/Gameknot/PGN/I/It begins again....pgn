1. e4 c5 2. Na3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 e6 5. f4 cxd4 6. Qxd4 {I think queens early excursion maybe dubious but I am no expert on whites opening strategy } Nc6 7. Qa4 Nb6 {Hitting the queen again ..did not see any other ideas..probably good to move the knight now as it may be attacked with c4 } 8. Qb3 Nd4 {Harassing the queen some more .. moving both knights more than once in the opening, hoping this is justified by whites queen placement} 9. Qd3 Bc5 10. Nf3 Nxf3+ 11. Qxf3 d6 {I was not sure what black should play here, I did not want to play d5 as I thought it locks my pieces in on the queenside and whites Knight can possibly make it to d4} 12. Qg3 {I think this is questionable as black is probably going to castle anyway, maybe white needed something else here but it is hard to find a plan} O-O 13. Bd3 dxe5 14. fxe5 f5 {blocking white's white squared bishop} 15. Bg5 Qd4 16. Rb1 {White's King will remain in the center now} Bxa3 17. bxa3 f4 18. Qh4 Qxe5+ 19. Kf1 g6 20. Re1 Qg7 21. Bh6 Qf6 22. Bg5 Qc3 23. Be7 Rf7 24. Bb4 Qc7 25. Bd2 {Spent a long time thinking about black's next move and finally came up with the following plan} Nc4 26. Bc1 {Black's knight now offers attacking possibilities on e3} Bd7 27. Re4 Bb5 {This move looks to be dropping a pawn but conceals something more sinister} 28. Rxe6 Ne3+ 29. Bxe3 fxe3+ 30. Ke2 Qxc2+ {Here my buddy resigned, I am sure he will kick my ass again soon but nice to pull one back}
