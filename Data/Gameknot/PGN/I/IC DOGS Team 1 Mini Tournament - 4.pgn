[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 {Fischer once said of 1. e4 "Best by test."} c5 {The Sicilian defense is one of the most popular choices for black.} 2. Nf3 {The open Sicilian (the closed would be 2. Nc3) is the most challenging continuation.} g6 {The hyper-accelerated dragon.  In the accelerated dragon black plays 2. ...Nc6.} 3. d4 {The principled continuation.} cxd4 {Black will try and control the dark squares along the h8-a1 diagonal, especially d4 and e5.} 4. Nxd4 Nc6 {Developing towrds the center and with an eye on d4 and e5.} 5. c4 {Establishing the so-called Maroczy Bind.  Black often wants to play d7-d5 in the dragon lines, and the move 5. c4 is intended to discourage that possibility once and for all.  This used to be all the rage against the accelerated dragon, but theory maintains that black is OK.} Nf6 {Black wishes to complete his kingside development prior to issuing any challenges to white's position.  Black will seek counterplay along the dark squares and on the queenside.} 6. Nc3 {Defending the e-pawn, while continuing to develop.} d6 {With d5 out of the picture for the foreseeable picture, black opens the c8-h3 diagonal and prevents e4-e5.} 7. Be2 {It is often difficult to activate this bishop.  Notice that while the e and c-pawns have a cramping effect on black's position, they also limit the e2 bishop's mobility.} Nxd4 {This capture trades one knight, which has moved twice, for one that has also moved twice.  In terms of the element of time, the trade would be neutral, except that it also brings the queen to a square that will come under attack.  The queen will be forced to move again, costing white a tempo.} 8. Qxd4 {Restoring material equality.} Bg7 {The dragon bishop takes up its usual perch.} 9. Bg5 {One of several plausible continuations.  White develops the bishop first and then plays the queen behind it on either d2 or e3.} O-O {Completing black's kingside development.  Black is now looking for queenside counterplay.} 10. Qd2 {A typical queen and bishop battery along the c1-h6 diagonal.  A typical way of attacking the fianchetto is to try and exchange bishops leaving the (in this case) dark squares weak.} Be6 {White wants to tie white down to the defense of the c-pawn.} 11. Rc1 {A normal move.  White removes the rook from the long square diagonal and positions it on the c-file, where it can help defend the c-pawn, and where it will be come active, if the c-file is ever opened.  Typically, white's other rook goes to d1.} Qa5 {Notice how the queen can still influence the center even when developed to the side of the board.  From a5 she can help control e5, for example.  She is also clearing the way for the f-rook to transfer to the queenside.} 12. f3 {White is setting up a super-solid position.  The knight on c3 no longer has to worry about the defense of the e4 pawn.} Rfc8 {Continuing with the theme of queenside counterplay, black attacks the c-pawn a second time.} 13. b3 {Although the pawns on e4 and c4 seem secure now, this further weakens the h8-a1 diagonal.  As with many moves in chess, you have to give up something in order to get something.} a6 {Black is going to try and open lines on the queenside.  A well timed b7-b5 will usually free his position.} 14. Na4 {Offering to go into an ending with apporximately even chances.} Qxd2+ {Black doesn't mind the ending, because the "Bind" isn't as significant as it is during the middlegame.} 15. Kxd2 Nd7 {Black had to react to white's threatened knight fork on b6.  Notice that black's e-pawn isn't really hanging, because 16. Bxe7 would be answered by 16. ...Bh6  skewering the rook on c1.} 16. g4 {Now the e-pawn really is hanging.} f6 {Driving the bishop away.  17. Bh4 loses to 17. ...Bh6  so white retreats to e3.  Normally you wouldn't want to block your g7 bishop with a pawn on f6, but black is intending to continue on with f6-f5, reopening the diagonal.} 17. Be3 f5 {Ideally, black would like to isolate white's e-pawn while maintaining control over e5.} 18. gxf5 {White captures on f5 in order to open the g-file for his rooks.} gxf5 19. Rhg1 {Threatening 20. Bh6.} Rcf8 {I preferred this to the alternatives at the time, but it does lead to a further reduction in material.  Black stands no worse, but has little prospect of creating winning chances.} 20. Bd4 Rf7 21. Bxg7 Rxg7 22. Rxg7+ Kxg7 {Following the captures, black has lost his "dragon" bishop, but his remaining bishop is better than white's.  This is not enough to make a difference in the game, however.} 23. c5 {A very nice way to secure the draw.  It increases the bishop's mobility and prevents black from establishing a superior pawn structure.} dxc5 {1/2-1/2 Now, once the f-pawns are exchanged both e-pawns will be isolated, so black will have no advantage.  A very solid game by white.}
