[Opening "Dutch defence (A84)"]

1. d4 {Queen's pawn opening... } f5 {I wanted to try something new, so I played this. The GK database lists this as the Dutch Defence } 2. c4 {White seems to play this after d4 almost all the time, it seems... } Nf6 3. Nf3 b6 {!? normally, Black goes for a kingside fianchetto here, but here he goes for kingside development } 4. Bf4 {Bishop development... } Bb7 {Bishop development... } 5. e3 {now that this move doesn't block in the dark-square bishop, this move is perfectly fine } d6 {Post-mortem, I considered d5... but I should mention, I was treating the opening like a rapid-fire blitz game, and in my head I had already planned these moves. Besides, d5 might not have been the best line of play anyway... what if White plays c5? (I should mention, I find those kind of moves very annoying!) } 6. Nc3 Nbd7 {the last of the knights get developed } 7. Bd3 {here's where I stopped playing blitz and put a little thought into my next move. I want to play e5, but White has too many defenders on the e5 square. Then I noticed that my f5 pawn was hanging, so I decided that it needed protection. Finally, I considered the possibility of simply blocking the bishop's scope... } Ne4 {I think that this is a good move, despite the 'moving piece twice in the opening' thing - and it did happen to be the onit's the only time where I played a move that took me more than ten seconds :P either the knight gets to keep a farily strong post on e5 or... } 8. Bxe4 {as in this case of the exchange... [of course, NxN? falls to a pawn fork at e4] } fxe4 {the defending piece on the e5 square is driven away, and Black gets to play his desired e5... } 9. Ng5 {? All of a sudden, e4 has a lot more sting... } e5 {! Because of the discovered attack on the knight, and the fact that the bishop will be forced to move away from the knight's defence (or be taken) White is forced to shed material } 10. dxe5 dxe5 11. Ncxe4 {the best way to get something out of the deal - White gets two pawns for the piece... } exf4 12. exf4 {..like this. I took a quick look at the position here and realised that I could win even more material. I played the next move without much thought... } h6 {?? thinking that there was nothing to think about. The knight has to retreat, and Black's fianchettoed bishop will snatch up the knight, leaving Black with a winning advantage. There is just one very small problem with this... } 13. Qh5+ {White now has a mate! (here, I resigned, but I'll show you the mate) } g6 14. Qxg6+ Ke7 15. Qf7# {I'm pretty sure that almost all the people who have read through this annotation has experienced something like this.. you think you have a big advantage, you think you have a winning advantage then your opponent pulls the rug away from you! (though fair play to White for getting the mate) I have quite a few 'skeletons in the closet' like this, so I figured that I'd get this one off my chest :) }
