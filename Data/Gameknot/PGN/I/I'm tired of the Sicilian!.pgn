[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 e6 {One d4 opening. We'll see if this person wants to play it badly enough to face the Dutch Stonewall.} 2. e4 {I guess not. Time to transpose into a Sicilian. } c5 {I don't remember if I've written how little I've ever played the Sicilian, or against it. But my theory is that someone that wants to play a controlled, Q-pawn game isn't naturally comfortable in a wild Sicilian. Then again, I'm not very comfortable in a wild Sicilian, which is why I play conservative Sicilians -- if such things exist.   I've played in one mini-tournament where the theme was the Scheveningen. And I'm finishing another Sicilian-themed mini-tournament where I've used the Taimanov Sicilian in my games. That's what this should transpose to.} 3. d5 {That move isn't possible in the Sicilian. Not sure how I should handle it.} exd5 4. exd5 d6 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Nc3 a6 {This is to keep his knight off of b5.} 7. a4 Be7 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O Bf5 10. Re1 Ne4 {I would've liked to move Nbd7, but I don't have a good reply if he plays Nh4. The move I was originally worried about here was Qd3, because if I trade knights and bishops, then I'm looking at Bf4 at some point, and it'll be even harder to get the knight out and keep protecting my pawn on d6. But I decided if he plays Qd3 here, I can try Ng3.} 11. Nxe4 Bxe4 12. Bd3 Bxd3 13. Qxd3 Nd7 14. Bf4 Re8 {Well, this game was postponed for a month, and now I'm trying to remember what my plans were. No clue, so let's do something that doesn't tie my queen down to protecting my bishop. } 15. Nd2 Nf6 16. h3 b5 {I'm not thrilled with any of my options here.  After Nh5, White retreats Bh2, and then my best move seems to just go back to f6. I'm almost tempted to play Bf8 and try to force some trades. It may still come to that.} 17. b3 {I just checked the status for this match. We're down 0-2 with four games left. And I'm hoping for a draw on this match, but maybe I need to be more aggressive. Looking at the other two games in the match, they aren't as far along as mine.} Bf8 18. c4 {Okay, he wants to force the issue. I feel I've got two choices. One is to close things up with b4. My other choice is to trade on a4 and e1 and then grab the open file with Rb8. I said I was thinking of how to play smart and keep things safe, so I'm leaning to b4.} b4 19. Bg5 Rxe1+ {I'm pretty sure that Bd7 is safer, but I can't imagine a more boring move here. I just couldn't do it.} 20. Rxe1 h6 21. Bh4 g5 22. Bg3 Bg7 23. f4 Nh5 24. fxg5 Nxg3 25. Qxg3 hxg5 {I sure don't want to trade queens. I need to keep as much material on the board for now. If I trade anything, it's got to be pawns, if I'm going to have a chance for a draw.} 26. Ne4 Be5 27. Qxg5+ Qxg5 28. Nxg5 f6 29. Ne6 Kf7 30. g4 {I've got to go for a draw. That outside pawn is going to be what kills me. I think I'm going  to trade the rook for his knight and a pawn. That knight of his is too strong, and my rook isn't doing anything, so might as well get rid of one of his pawns.} Ra7 31. Rf1 Re7 32. Kg2 Rxe6 33. dxe6+ Kxe6 34. Rd1 Kf7 35. Kf3 {He's got at least three ways to win. 1) His h-pawn. 2) Invade the king on d6 and go get the a-pawn and make another passed pawn. 3) Move the king to c6 and trade his rook for my bishop and pawn. Then he just takes the queenside pawns while I have to stop the kingside pawns. What other choices do I have? Put the king on e6, play f5 to trade pawns and trade my bishop for his queen on h8? That's another losing plan. } Kg6 36. Ke4 Kg5 37. Rd3 Kh4 38. Rf3 Kg5 39. Kd5 Kh4 40. Kc6 Bg3 41. Rxf6 Kxh3 42. g5 Bh4 43. Rh6 Kg4 {I wish I could do a conditional move -- if he takes the bishop, I'll resign.} 44. Rxh4+ {He took it, of course.}
