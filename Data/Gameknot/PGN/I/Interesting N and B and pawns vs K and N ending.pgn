1. e4 {Routine Lion Defense until after White blunders and drops the exchange. } d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. Bg5 h6 5. Bxf6 Nxf6 6. Bd3 e5 7. dxe5 {White sees a chance to exchange queens and prevent Black from castling.  But Black does not fear that line.} dxe5 8. Bb5+ c6 9. Qxd8+ Kxd8 10. Bc4 Bb4 {Here black chooses a more active line. If now 11 BxP, BxN  12 PxB NxP Black is fine.} 11. O-O-O+ Ke7 12. Nge2 Be6 {Black decides a bishop exchange frees the king to stay centralized.} 13. Bxe6 Kxe6 14. f3 Rhd8 15. a3 Ba5 16. Na4 Nd7 17. b4 Bb6 {Black is willing to exchange the bishop given white's weakened pawn structure.} 18. Rd2 {But Rd2?? loses the exchange--better was Rd3.} Be3 {Pins the rook} 19. Nb2 {Black was threatening to take the rook and win the knight with discovered check. White also hopes that a later nd3 will block the d-file} Nb6 {Attacks the pinned rook again, and prepares to attack the rook from c4 if the Knight moves.} 20. Rhd1 {Protects the rook} Rxd2 21. Rxd2 Rd8 {Piles up on the pinned rook to simplify and force a winning endgame.} 22. Nd3 {the best try} Nc4 {attacks the pinned rook again} 23. Nc5+ {Doesn't accomplish much} Ke7 24. Nd3 Bxd2+ 25. Kb1 Nxa3+ 26. Kb2 Nc4+ 27. Kb3 b5 {Now Black has a strongly placed knight and bishop, and is up a rook, but how to break through?} 28. g4 f6 29. Ng3 g6 30. h4 a5 {After defending the kingside against penetration, Black now wants to open lines for the rook.} 31. bxa5 Nxa5+ 32. Kb2 Rxd3 {Rxd3!!? A carefully considered sacrifice. Black gets a piece and pawn for the rook, simplifies to an advantageous ending, and gains pawn majorities on both sides of the board.} 33. cxd3 Be1 34. Ne2 Bxh4 35. Ka3 Be1 {Blacks plan to win is simple. Restrain the king, threaten to exchange white's last piece, and coordinate the knight and bishop to drive the king back into a corner if the exchange is declined. } 36. d4 Nc4+ 37. Ka2 Ke6 38. dxe5 Nxe5 {wins another pawn} 39. f4 Nxg4 40. Nd4+ Kd6 41. f5 g5 {creates connected passed pawns while restraining white's pawns.} 42. Kb3 Nf2 43. Kc2 Nxe4 44. Kd1 Bc3 45. Ne2 Be5 46. Kc2 Ng3 {White can't afford to exchange his last piece.} 47. Nc1 Nxf5 48. Kd3 {Now black can win easily by just advancing the pawns. But this is a good time to practice coordinating knight and bishop for use in future endings where black is not so far ahead.} c5 49. Na2 Nd4 50. Ke4 f5+ 51. Ke3 Kd5 {White is now driven back.} 52. Nc3+ Kc4 53. Nd1 Nc2+ 54. Kd2 Kb3 55. Kd3 c4+ 56. Kd2 f4 57. Nf2 Bc3+ {drives the king back.} 58. Kc1 Ne3 {Restraining the king.} 59. Ne4 Bb4 60. Kb1 c3 {Now is the time to advance the pawn if Black wants to try and effect a bishop and knight checkmate. This is the position } 61. Nf2 c2+ 62. Kc1 {Forced to avoid checkmate.} Nc4 {This is the position black was looking for. Checkmate is threatened in two ways, either on d2 or a3--white can only block one or the other.} 63. Ne4 Ba3# {esthetically pleasing checkmate.}
