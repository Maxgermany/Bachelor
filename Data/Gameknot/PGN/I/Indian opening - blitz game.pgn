1. e4 e5 2. d3 {An Indian opening, something not very common in blitz games (at least for me).} Bc5 {My favourite answer to this opening.} 3. h3 {It looked like a defensive starting by my rival.} h6 {He didn't want my bishop bothering, neither did I.} 4. Nf3 d6 {Seeking bishop e6.} 5. Nc3 {Development.} Nf6 {6. Nd5 Nxd5 7.exd5 was a variation that didn't worry me at first, so I continued developing my pieces and preparing to castle.} 6. b3 {Preparing d4?} Be6 7. Bb2 {Obviously.} O-O {Before starting the fight for the center...} 8. Be2 {He wanted his king to be protected too.} Nbd7 9. O-O c6 {Here we go.} 10. Nb1 {Wait a minute. A weakness in the long diagonal?} Qc7 {No way.} 11. Nbd2 {Looking for a better position for his knight. Now, the mid game. He had an useless white bishop, which gave me a small advantage in the board, didn't it?} d5 12. exd5 {Just what I expected.} Nxd5 {Kd5!? I could also have taken with my bishop or my c-pawn. But they were in good positions and f4 was a very attractive square. Correct decision? Let's see.} 13. Re1 {Rook on e-file.} Nf4 {That's it!} 14. Bf1 {Useless anywhere else, and allowing a discovered attack.} Bd6 {Protecting pawn in e5.} 15. Nc4 {An extra attacker to my poor pawn. And then, surely d3 white pawn would have been the next one.} f6 {So I permitted an exchange bishop-knight although a appreciated it (my bishop) a lot within this game.} 16. Nxd6 {I was his more active piece.} Qxd6 17. Re4 {Very brave.} b5 {Protecting the only square his rook could have gone. Why he would like to? Don't know, but just in case. I would also be helpful against a future c4.} 18. Bc1 {He definitely wanted to take my dangerous knight, something against I was ready to fight.} f5 {Threatening his rook.} 19. Re1 Rf6 {A flexible move, I think. Ready to move to g6 and start bothering his king, also protecting my bishop for the future.} 20. Bxf4 {It was going to happen.} exf4 {Better and a previous g5 and gxf4, isn't it? Now pawns were starting to be... not to be welcome, let's say.} 21. Qd2 {He thought the same.} g5 {Sending my attack. a5 was also possible, I saw just after moving.} 22. Qc3 {Fortunately, he decided not to do Qa5.} b4 {He had to decide.} 23. Qb2 {Occupying the diagonal was his choice. It's OK for me.} Rg6 {Preparing the attack, now the queen was far away from trouble. From his trouble.} 24. Ne5 {Taking with the knight would have implied two rooks in e5, something I definitely didn't want.} Rg7 25. Re2 Re8 26. Rae1 {mm OK, but I still had my knight, ready to take his in case he wanted his to help in the defense. Maybe that's not a reason, but this was the situation I had to face. And I was quite happy with it.} g4 {I supposed he was going to take it.} 27. hxg4 {Of course he did. Any better choice?} fxg4 {Now he must be extremely careful. I was delighted with how everything was taking place.} 28. Kh1 {I don't know yet what he wanted with this. I tried to understand how it would help him, but none answer was found.} g3 {g3, the key to the mate.} 29. f3 {?? f3 was where his knight was supposed to go in order to defend h2!} Qe7 {Here he eventually resigned. I enjoyed a lot this game and thought it was interesting enough for annotating it. Thank you for reading.}
