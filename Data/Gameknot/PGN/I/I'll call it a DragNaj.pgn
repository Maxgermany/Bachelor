1. Nf3 {Reti, I like this opening when I'm white so maybe we think alike... we shall see.} c5 2. c3 Nf6 3. e3 {Unusual so far.} g6 4. Be2 Bg7 5. O-O {He castles, and although his pawn structure is weak and keeping his queen's knight out, he has not committed any major errors.  At least not any which a caliber player like myself could exploit.} O-O {However, I do like my position better.} 6. c4 d6 7. d3 {I think I would've moved e4 and disrupted the center a little bit.} Nbd7 8. Nc3 {His knight is now involved, but he had to make three pawn moves to do so.} a6 {I've got some crazy looking Najdorf/Dragon thing going on here.} 9. b3 Rb8 10. e4 b5 {I feel like it is time to start an attack.} 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Bg5 b4 {I actually would not mind trading my knight for his dsb, but he chooses not to trade.} 13. Na4 {This is an awkward square for his knight, and is useless until I initiate an exchange later.} Nxe4 {I decided to sacrifice my knight and bishop for his rook, since I deemed his knight on a4 to kind of being out of commission.} 14. dxe4 Bxa1 15. Qxa1 f6 {Now my goal is to play sharp enough to survive the predicted attacks.} 16. Bh6 Re8 17. Bc4+ e6 18. Bf4 Qe7 {My position is very tight, but surprisingly allows for a decent counter-attack.} 19. Rd1 {I think I would've moved the a4 knight to b2 to try to get him active on the other side of the board.  It might have taken a few moves, but my position is so cramped, that I would have likely taken time to do anything positive anyway.} Nb6 {This is the exhange I mentioned earlier.  I did this to provide some breathing room.} 20. Nxb6 Rxb6 21. a4 {A good idea, but I was hoping for this.} bxa3 e.p. {I think this was a key move for me.  First, it gives my rooks much more strength with an open file, and now I'm thinking of ways to trap his bishop on f4 also.} 22. Qxa3 Rb7 23. e5 {a bad move in my opinion.} dxe5 {now I have two open files.  Even though his rook is on the file, it still benefits me to have it open.} 24. Be3 Rc7 25. Ba6 Bxa6 26. Qxa6 {Now his queen is trapped.} Rd7 27. Rxd7 Qxd7 28. Bxc5 {I think better would have been Qa1 to defend the obvious attack at hand.} Qd1+ 29. Qf1 Rd8 {Now his queen is in serious trouble.} 30. g3 Qxb3 31. Ne1 {I think Kg2 was better.} Qc3 {Now I want him to waste a move protecting his bishop so that the rest of my plan can unfold.} 32. Bb6 Rd1 {I have a pin on top of a pin.} 33. h4 {He should've sacrificed the knight and tried to survie with Q and B.} Rxe1 {Stick a fork in him... he's done.} 34. Bd8 Rxf1+ 35. Kxf1 Qd3+ 36. Kg2 Qxd8 37. g4 Qd3 38. f3 h6 39. Kg3 e4 {And white resigns.}
