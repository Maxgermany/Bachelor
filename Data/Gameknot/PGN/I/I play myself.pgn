[Opening "Giuoco Pianissimo (C50)"]

1. e4 {A promising opening.} e5 {A good enough return. I'm never confident to try something different like c5 because I am never too sure how to take it through.} 2. Nf3 {A simple and quite a popular move for white.} Nc6 {An easy way to defend the pawn for black.} 3. Bc4 {Threatening the pawn on f7 by later moving my knight to g5.} Bc5 {A move I'd usually do in this sort of game.} 4. d3 {To protect my knight if i was to move my knight to g5.} Nf6 {Giving myself a possibility to castle.} 5. Ng5 {Might as well have a shot at forking the queen and the rook.} O-O {Unfortunately, I would castle.} 6. O-O {And the same goes for white.} h6 {Scare the knight back.} 7. Nf3 {Hardly any other option.} d6 {Let my other bishop free.} 8. h3 {Stop the bishop pinning my knight.} a6 {Another move to past time.} 9. a3 {Same again.} Be6 {Time for some swap offs.} 10.

Qxe3 {I take with my queen to avoid double pawns.} d5 {Advance pawn to remove the double pawns.} 15. exd5 {I take in attempt to get a pawn up.} exd5 {Now I am in a fix as I'm going to lose a pawn.} 16. Qxe5 {There goes the pawn.} Re8 {Scare the queen away before it can do anymore harm.} 17. Qf5 {Moving out of the line of the rook.} c6 {Protect my pawn from future attacks.} 18. Rfe1 {I feel prepared for swap offs.} Rf8 {I hope to do some type of suprise attack on the white queen.} 19. Qg6 {Moving out of harms way.} b5 {Begin to push my pawns.} 20. Re3 {Bring my rook into the game.} a5 {Push pawns further.} 21. Rae1 {Double up my rooks.} Rb8 {Move my rook so I can push pawns further.} 22. Rg3 {Threaten checkmate.} Rf7 {Not much other option.} 23. Ree3 {Bring my other rook into the game.} d4 {I have accomplished some sort of trap.} 24. Ref3 {Imposing an attack on the black knight.} dxc3 {I capture the knight.} 25. bxc3 {Put an end to that pawn.} c5 {I continue to push my pawns.} 26. Qxh6 {I now realise that I can take that pawn.} b4 {I still continue to push my pawns forward.} 27. cxb4 {I take to get rid of my double pawns.} cxb4 {I take back.} 28. axb4 {Not much of an option.} a4 {I advance my pawn in hope to get a queen.} 29. c3 {I push pawn to protect my other pawn from the black rook.} a3 {I continue advancing.} 30. Qc1 {I bring my queen back to stop the pawn proceeding.} Ra8 {I protect my pawn.} 31. Qa1 {I move my queen to the end.} a2 {I continue to push my pawn as it is protected.} 32. c4 {I also push my pawn.} Nd7 {I bring my knight into the game and move it from danger zone.} 33. Rxf7 {I accept the swap off.} Kxf7 {Not much other choice.} 34. Qxg7+ {I am back in the game.} Ke6 {I attempt to push my king into safety- a real blunder.} 35. Rg6+ {I have nearly got mate I believe.} Kf5 {No other option.} 36. g4+ {I am now playing about with black.} Kf4 {Again I have no other option.} 37. Qd4+ {I go for the kill.} Kf3 {Oh boy.} 38. Qe3# {And there it is. This game proves that if I was to play a game against myself I would do better as white but this obvoiusly depends on my move and how much time I spend thinking on each move and as this game was made on the spot and is the very first against myself, it is quite unreliable to show which colour suits me better.}
