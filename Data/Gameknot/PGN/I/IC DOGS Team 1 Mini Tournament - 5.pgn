[Opening "Sicilian (B23), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 {1. e4 gains space and opens lines for the king bishop and the queen.  The  strategic drawback is that d4 and f4 have been slightly weakened. Since pawns can never move backwards, the e-pawn can never help control those squares.  The e-pawn may itself become an object of attack.} c5 {The Sicilian defense.  The idea is to create an imbalance in the position.  Black will frequently trade a wing pawn for a center pawn, and try to control the center witha 2 to 1 pawn majority.} 2. Nc3 {The closed Sicilian avoids an early d4.} Nc6 {Black develops naturally by centralizing a knight and attacking d4 and e5.} 3. f4 {The so-called Grand Prix attack.  White is hoping to gain space in the center and on the kingside, and then launch an attack.} e6 {3. ...g6 and 3. ...d6 are frequently played alternatives.} 4. Nf3 {White will want to complete his kingside development and castle quickly in preperation for the attack.} Nf6 {A normal looking move, but the knight is better placed on e7.  4. ...d5 would be better and would keep black in the game for spatial control.} 5. e5 {Gaining space without the cost of a tempo, since the black knight must move again.} Nd5 {Other moves lose time as well as space.} 6. Nxd5 {The black knight was threatening the f-pawn, so white plays to mangle black's pawn structure.} exd5 {Forced in order to restore material equality.} 7. d4 {White wishes to exchange the d-pawn for black's c-pawn leaving black with doubled isolated pawns.} Be7 {7. ...d6 was a better move.} 8. c3 {I considered 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Qxd5 Qb6 too risky for white.  Quiet moves will leave black with a weakened pawn structure with no risk to white's position.} d6 {A good move.  Black would like to complete his development and create some counterplay.} 9. Be3 {White wants to catch up in development before initiating exchanges in the center.} Bf5 {9. ...dxe5 would've forced white to tip his hand.  I would've played 10. fxe5 and if 10. ...cxd4 11. cxd4 Bb4  12. Kf2.} 10. Bd3 {Once white castles he'll be ready to clarify the situation in the center.} Qd7 {10. ...Bxd3 and 11. ...dxe5 was still the way to go.} 11. exd6 {Now, white is winning a pawn.} Bf6 {Better would've been 11. ...Bxd6 12. dxc5 Bc7, but it is still much better for white.  In chess sometimes you must take your medicine and choose the lesser of evils.} 12. dxc5 {Now, the advanced pawns are a serious problem for black.  Black could've had essentially the same position minus white's pawn on d6.} O-O-O {Blasck needs to counter attack, but how?  If black would've eliminated the d6 pawn earlier, you can imagine ways of creating mischief, but now it is very difficult.} 13. O-O {White finally secures his king.} Rde8 {Play down the e-file is ineffective, but it is better than nothing.} 14. Bd4 {White is two pawns to the good and willing to trade pieces.} Nxd4 {  14. ...Bxd3 was the alternative, now or on the next move..} 15. Nxd4 {Forcing black's hand.  15. ...Bxd4 16. cxd4 secures the advanced pawns, and 15. ...Bxd3 16. Qxd3 is much better for white as well.} Re3 {Over looking white's next.} 16. Bxf5 {1-0.  4. ...Nf6 put black behind the eight ball a little bit, because white was able to grab some space for free.  White then tried to saddle black with inferior pawn structure as well.  Black tried to sacrifice material in order to gain counter play, but white's positional advantage was maintained.}
