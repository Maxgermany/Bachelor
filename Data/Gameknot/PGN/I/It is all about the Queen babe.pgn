1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 {queen's gambit accepted } 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Qc2 {Normal is Nc3 or e3 but I am aiming for quick development and domination on the light squares} Nc6 5. Qxc4 Be6 {gaining a slight tempo against the queen but blocking the develop of the king side. } 6. Qa4 {An awkward square for the queen but it has to remain on the 4th rank because of the weakness on d4 } Bd5 {I am not sure if this is the best since it breaks black's attack on d4 perhaps ...a6 is an improvement.  6... a6 7. e3 b5 8. Qc2 Nb4 9. Qd2 c5 10. a3 Qa5 11. Nc3 Nc6 12. dxc5 b4 13. Ne2 Ne4 14. Qd1 bxa3+ 15. Bd2 Qxc5 16. Rxa3=} 7. e3 {making sure your centre is solid and adquently defended is the first step in developing a successful attack. Consequently, the neglect of center is the hallmark of an attack that is doomed to fail. The lesson is that you should never go after the enemy king if you have a weak unsupported center.} Qd7 8. Nc3 {! highlighting the major drawback of 6. ...Bd5 because the threat is to capture on d5 winning the strategic long term advantage of the bishop pair for white. } Bxf3 {this is better than 9. ...e6 since black gets some form of compensation in a long term damage to whites pawn structure. However, in return black gives up the bishop pair and gives white an extra centre pawn. } 9. gxf3 {black has given up the long term advantage of the bishop pair in exchange for a permanate target on f3. However, the drawback is that white now has an extra pawn in the center so black now has to watch out for a timely e4 break. } e5 {Black already is feeling the need to take drastic measures. Since any quiet moves like ...e6 would allow white to build a overwhelming center with 10. Bb5 Be7(10. ...a6 11. Bxc6 bxc6 12. Rg1 c5 13. dxc5 looks better for white) 11. e4 0-0 12. Be3 and white can take his time building on his space advantage. } 10. dxe5 Nxe5 {black is doing what he has to which is to attack the f3 weakness. but white had a deflection tactic to prevent black from capturing on f3 with check. } 11. Qxd7+ {! The black knight on E5 must capture or f4 is to follow with a winning position. } Nfxd7 {?! dubious since after 12. f4 the knights are tripping over each other. Better is Nexd7} 12. f4 {Gaining a huge space advantage and denying the knight the ideal e5 square. Up until this point I have not actually mounted any serious attack against the king. However, this is about to change because after 12. f4 I have defecto domination of the centre which usaully means a count blanc to do what every you want to do. Often if you play it calm and continue to play logical moves that are not too aggressive your opponent with get impatient and break himself on your pawn wall. After which you storm in sac him!} Ng6 {?? This knight more than likely should have gone to c6 but I think he is planning to go to f3. The problem is that he never gets there} 13. Bd2 {developing the bishop and preparing for queenside castling} Rd8 {13. ...Nh4? 14. 0-0-0 Nf3 15. Nb5 winning at least a pawn. } 14. h4 {played to threaten h5 and preventing the black knight from jumping into the f3 hole via h4} Be7 {a useful move that forces white to play h5 allowing the knight to go to h4} 15. h5 Nh4 {The knight is chomping at the bit to go to f3. } 16. O-O-O {side stepping ...Nf3+ and challenging for control of the d file. } c6 {preventing any tactical ideas involving Nb5 or Nd5 since 16. ...Nf3? 17. Nd5 Nxd2 18. Nxc7+ winning a pawn. } 17. e4 {gaining more space and opening up the e3 square for the bishop so it can keep an eye on c5 and attack a7} f5 {What else was there? perhaps 17. ...b5!? when 18. Be3 Nb6 19. Rxd8+ Kxd8 20. Rh3 does nothing to slow white's build up. The major drawback of 17. ..f5 is that the black kings is now stuck in the center. } 18. e5 g5 {attempting to open lines on the kingside and create some counterplay} 19. hxg6 e.p. hxg6 {Black threatens to free himself with ...g5} 20. Be3 {another tactic that involves a pin on e7 that prevents 20. ...g5 } Nb6 21. a4 {pressuring black's knight on b6} Rxd1+ 22. Kxd1 Bb4 {preventing a4-a5 and threatening BxN} 23. Kc2 {if 23... Bxc3  then 24. bxc3 Nxa4 25. f3 Nb6 26. Bf2 Nd5 27. c4 Nxf4 28. Rxh4 Rxh4 29. Bxh4 with a winning advantage. } Rh5 {black is still trying to play ..nf3 however that is not going to happen so better is 23...Kd7 24. f3 Be7 25. a5 Nd5 26. Nxd5 cxd5 27. Bxa7 Ke6 28. Kd1 g5 29. fxg5 Bxg5 30. Bd4 is better than the game line.} 24. Rh3 {preventing Nf3} Nc8 25. f3 {threatening Bf2 winning the knight} a5 26. Bf2 {?? better than the game move is 26. Nb1! Be7 27. Nd2 Kd7 28. Nc4 Bd8 29. Bf2 Ke6 30. Kb3 Rh8 31. Be1 } Be7 27. Ne2 {Up until now black has managed to parry all of whites threats but the reality is that black's only active piece(the bishop) is overworked. I plan to play threatening Nxa5 long term I want my knight c4 which will put black is a virtual zugwig. } Kd7 28. Nc1 b6 29. Kb3 Bd8 30. Bd3 {preventing ...g5} Be7 31. Ne2 {threatening Nd5} Bc5 {?? any peice exchanges would end up favoring white greatly so ...Kc7 or ...Bd8 would offer stiffer resistance. } 32. Rxh4 {why not 32. Bxc5?? well the answer is that white wins a pawn through the exchange. } Bxf2 33. Rxh5 gxh5 34. Bxf5+ {it is all over now the connected past pawns will be unstoppable. } Kd8 35. Bh3 Ne7 36. f5 Nd5 37. Kc4 {in the end game kings belong in the center so do not be afraid to let your king go for a walk up the board. } b5+ 38. axb5 Ne3+ 39. Kd3 cxb5 40. Ke4 Nc4 41. f6 {black resigns. }
