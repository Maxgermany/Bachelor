1. e4 c5 2. c3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. c4 Nb6 5. Nf3 d6 {this position remineds a littele bit of Alekhne's defense , when white have space and center controll while black makes presure on the center , but the only difrense of this idea is , the black didnt play Bg4 .} 6. exd6 exd6 7. Nc3 Nc6 8. d4 {good move , white opens his DBS diagonal , and build good center and activity for his pieces .} cxd4 9. Nxd4 Be7 {good move , black developme his DSB corectly , the idea of 9...g6 and bishop g7 is less effective because of the weakness of d6 pawn .} 10. Be3 O-O 11. Be2 {white peices are placed well , and doesnt interupt each other , now all i need is 0-0 and  i all most dont have problems .} d5 {good move , black wishes to get reed of his d6 weakness and attacks whites center .} 12. Nxc6 {i don't know if its mistake but ,surely was unnecessary move , i am helping black to opens his B file for his rook  , better move was 12.cxd5-Nxd5.13.0-0 and i am fine .} bxc6 13. Bxb6 {another strange move , i thught that after 13.Bxb6 and cxd i win a free pawn ,however i missed blacks next move .} Qxb6 14. cxd5 Qxb2 {good move , now i cant 15.dxc because of 15...Qxc3+, i simpley had a feeling that i am loseing my game .} 15. Rc1 cxd5 16. Nxd5 Bg5 17. Rc2 Qe5 {blacks pieces very active here.} 18. O-O Bb7 19. Bf3 Rad8 {good move , the black rooks now joining to the game ,Rook(a)pined the whites knight on d5 while R(f)will move to e8.} 20. Re1 {good move , as i was all most hopeless, i found a nice defense, 20.Re1 attacks to retreat from E file , and takes very effective position , and another idea is , that the black queen take a powerful spot on e5 and i had to some how to divorce it from there. } Qb8 {20...Qd6 was better , however it losing the eeffect of the pine on the white knight on d5 (20...Qb6.21.Nc3-Qxd1.22.Rxd1),the queen still can move to another active spots ,like g6. now i am take over on the game again .} 21. Rb2 {threating Rxb7 and Nf6+,} Kh8 22. Qb1 {maybe the winning move , the threat is winning the black DSB on b7 , now moves like 22....Rd7 wont help black because of .23.Qf5! and afork on the rook on d7 and the DSB on g5 . therefor black giving his queen for a knigh and a rook .} Bxd5 23. Rxb8 Rdxb8 24. Qf5 {even if white have small material advantage , the active queen is makes the deference . this shows how  queen can be so dangerous when it have power full position .} Bxf3 25. Qxf3 Bf6 26. h3 h6 27. a4 Rfd8 28. Rd1 Rxd1+ 29. Qxd1 Kg8 30. Qd7 Be5 {white still have to be careful here , if 31.Qxa7??-Rb1#.} 31. g3 a5 32. Qa7 Rb1+ 33. Kg2 Bc3 34. Qa8+ {and black resigns , after 34...Kh7 (forced).35.Qe4+-g6.36.Qxb1 and black loses his Rook and the game thank you i hope you enjoy the game .}
