1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d4 b6 {Queen's Indian defense by Capablanca.} 3. c4 Bb7 4. Nc3 e6 5. a3 {This variation is known as Petrosian_Kasparov system but used in 1930s by Sultan Khan well before Petrosian displayed its power to the public. This game is instructive in positional play.} d5 6. cxd5 exd5 {Present theory recommends, 6...Nxd5.} 7. Bg5 Be7 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 {This set-up is resembling the Queen's Gambit declined(QGD), Tartakower system.} Ne4 {This is called Capablanca's freeing maneuver in QGD. The idea is to exchange pieces to get out of the cramping effect of the QGD.} 10. Bf4 {Khan shows his deep understanding of the position and refuses to allow the freeing maneuver of Capablanca. This system where White places his bishop on f4 is an idea of Wilhelm Steinitz and we can see that idea in this game.} Nd7 11. Qc2 f5 {Capablanca's knight has occupied the center, well supported by pawns and the other knight is ready to move to f6. Capablanca has a vise grip in the center which is difficult to shake off.} 12. Nb5 {White is trying to clamp down on the backward pawn on c7.} Bd6 {Capablanca protects it and offers an exchange of his bishop for knight because the center is blocked and also challenging white's dark squared bishop on the h2-b8 diagonal.} 13. Nxd6 cxd6 {The position is difficult for an amateur like me to understand. Black has a doubled pawn on the d-file which is blocked. White has control of the c-file at the moment. Black's bishop on b7 is buried, while the battery of White queen and bishop is blocked successfully.} 14. h4 {Since the center is blocked, white initiates a flank attack on Black's castled king. White king feels safe in the blocked center.} Rc8 15. Qb3 Qe7 16. Nd2 {White wants to get rid off Black's dominating knight in the center.} Ndf6 {Capablanca reinforces his knight.} 17. Nxe4 fxe4 {Capablanca blocks the center with pawns.} 18. Be2 Rc6 {Capablanca is slowly placing his pieces to dominate the c-file by doubling Rooks. Looks like Black is gaining a positional superiority.} 19. g4 {White continues his flank attack on the king side.} Rfc8 {Capablanca controls the c-file. How does one feel playing White in this position?} 20. g5 {Attack!} Ne8 21. Bg4 {White is transferring pieces to the king side and his lsb now challenges the c-file control by attacking the rook on c8. A slow positional reply to Capa's plan.} Rc6c1+ {Boom! Capa crashes in with a counter attack!} 22. Kd2 Rc8c2+ {Will this massing of rooks so close to the king demoralize white?} 23. Qxc2 {Poof! Khan gives up his Queen for 2 Rooks, an advantageous exchange. Did Capa overlook this or did he plan something beyond this?} Rxc2+ 24. Kxc2 Qc7+ 25. Kd2 Qc4 {Capa is closing in for the kill. His lsb can move to a6 and cause havoc in White's camp.} 26. Be2 {Khan refutes Capa's plans.} Qb3 27. Rab1 {Forced.} Kf7 {Capa is probably getting prepared for the endgame and brings his king towards the center.} 28. Rhc1 {Khan switches flanks and controls the c-file.} Ke7 29. Rc3 Qa4 30. b4 Qd7 {Black's queen is evicted from White's territory.} 31. Rbc1 {Now the tide seems to have changed in Khan's favor who controls the c-file but has no entry point. Capa has defended well.} a6 32. Rg1 Qa4 33. Rgc1 {Repeating moves? Is Capa suggesting a draw?} Qd7 34. h5 Kd8 35. Rc1c2 Qh3 {I don't understand the purpose of this move.} 36. Kc1 Qh4 37. Kb2 Qh3 38. Rc2c1 {Players are close to the 40th move and probably some moves are played with the time control in mind.} Qh4 {Looks like Capablanca is suggesting a draw.} 39. Rc3c2 Qh3 40. a4 Qh4 {I am now feeling certain that Capa is expecting a draw in this game. He is telling Khan to offer a draw which he is ready to accept. An ex-World champion and a legend offering a draw and who can refuse? 40 moves completed now and probably Capa wanted to catch up with the clock.} 41. Ka3 {I think Khan does not know Chess etiquette and he continues his attack on the queen side.} Qh3 42. Bg3 {Khan has firmly refused Capablanca's draw offer by covering the h4 square and Capa has to retreat his queen.} Qf5 {Her majesty retreats.} 43. Bh4 g6 44. h6 {Khan has blocked the king side and is planning an entry on the queen side for victory. It is surprising that Khan missed the following strong continuation: 44. hxg6 hxg6 45. b5 a5} Qd7 45. b5 a5 {Now Capa blocks the queen side and seems to mock at Khan. "Can you win?", seems to be Capa's question.} 46. Bg3 Qf5 47. Bf4 Qh3 {Now Capa is back to his Queen antics.} 48. Kb2 Qg2 49. Kb1 Qh3 50. Ka1 {What is going on here??} Qg2 51. Kb2 {White seems to be offering his f2 pawn. If Capa accepts, then white probably intends to play Bg4 and crash into the queen side. I hope I read the position correctly.} Qh3 {Capa is too good to fall for such poisoned pawns. This is positional understanding at a high level. Now look at the paralysis which Capa is undergoing. His minor pieces are defending the entry points on the c-file and cannot move. His only active piece is his queen which cannot do much on the king side. Here I can feel that Khan must be chuckling away inside and plotting an entry on the queen side. Can he crash in? Any sacrifice in the offing?} 52. Rg1 {Khan says. "No more queen antics".} Bc8 {Capablanca may have played this bishop move to come out of his miserable monotony. } 53. Rc6 {Khan was waiting patiently for this moment and grabs the god sent opportunity to enter the queen side.} Qh4 {Oh my God! Capablanca has surrendered! What could he do?} 54. Rgc1 {Khan is getting his attack rolling on the queen side.} Bg4 55. Bf1 {The strongest continuation says Fritz 10!!} Qh5 {Capa is planning Be2, and if White plays BxB then QxB and he crashes in.} 56. Re1 {Khan is watchful and plays accurately. However, 56. Rxb6 Be2 57. Rb8+ Kd7 was a better alternative.} Qh1 57. Rec1 {Khan says ,"back to business". } Qh5 {Threat renewed!} 58. Kc3 {Khan side steps Capa's minor attacking tricks.} Qh4 {Capa is still eyeing the f2 pawn.} 59. Bg3 {Khan says, "Enough is enough".} Qxg5 {Capa pounces on the available morsels.} 60. Kd2 {Khan has covered the e2 square now.} Qh5 {Now there is no threat and White now goes ahead with his queen side attack. A very patient temperament shown by Khan.} 61. Rxb6 {Culmination of attack on the queen side.} Ke7 62. Rb7+ Ke6 63. b6 {How is 63. Rxh7 opening up the king side also?} Nf6 64. Bb5 {Black's king is caught in the center!} Qh3 {Tantamount to resignation.} 65. Rb8 {Capablanca resigns!!! What a positional battle!}
