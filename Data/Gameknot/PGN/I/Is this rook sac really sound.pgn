1. d4 {Is this rook sac really sound? In this game my opponent sacrificed a rook early on. Although black seems to not have enough compensation, I was unable to find a way to consolidate and lost quickly. Has anyone seen this sacrifice before? Also - where did I go wrong? The post-match computer analysis doesn't record any mistake by me until the last few moves, when it is clearly lost for me - although it claims - perhaps wrongly - that the sacrifice was a mistake. Your comments would be most welcome!} Nf6 {So black defends against my queen's pawn with the Indian defences} 2. c4 {I continue with the most commonly played move} g6 {Black shows an indication to play the King's Indian or Grunfeld Defence} 3. Nc3 {And I continue with the most commonly played move.} d5 {And black plays the Grunfeld} 4. f3 {This is a quirky, rarely played move. Someone played it as white against me. In the first game I met it, I lost, and I adopted it for a while, and enjoyed some successes with it. I am not sure that I would still play it against an equally rated opponent. My opponent was then rated about 1600, and I played it in a "give him a chance" frame of mind. Perhaps my lose can be traced to this move?} c5 {This is the best reply, which has scored well for black.} 5. dxc5 {pxd5 seems to transpose into the normal exchange variation of the Grunfeld, where f3 is not normally played. dxc5 scores better in the Gameknot opening databases.} d4 {d4 is the only move in the database} 6. Nb5 {and in the same way Nb5 is the only move in the database} Nc6 {White won both the games on the database when black played the alternative e5, although I am not convinced that e5 is not playable.} 7. e3 {Again e3 is the only move on the database.} e5 {There is one game with pxe3 on the database, but white won it. e5 is the only other move on the database.} 8. exd4 {Again, the only move on the World database of Gameknot.} Nxd4 {White won both the games with exd4} 9. Bg5 {Now there are two games in the database with this position. Pomes Marcet, J… (2390) vs. Martinez, A. (2220) continued with Be7 and a draw. Nestorovic, Dej… (2424) vs. Misailovic, Neb… (2335) continued with Bxc5 10. Nxd4 exd4 11. Bd3 and black eventually won. But I thought "Hang on, if he takes on c5 I can just win the rook on a8". } Bxc5 {But he did take on c5. The post-game computer of Gameknot records this as a mistake, and gives white an advantage of +2.2 now.} 10. Bxf6 {So I did grab the material.} Qxf6 {he retakes the bishop of course.} 11. Nc7+ {So I grab the rook} Kf8 {Perhaps taking the rook is a mistake, and white can perhaps have an equal game after Nd5. What do you think?} 12. Nxa8 {But I took the rook!} Bb4+ {So first bit of counter-play, I am forced to move my king. But what of it? He has moved his king too.} 13. Kf2 {The only square.} e4 {mmm this is unpleasant, ideally I'd like to put my bishop on d3} 14. Be2 {So it has to go to e2 instead.} Nf5 {With some nasty threats. Post-match computer now gives this as level. Although it looks daft, maybe fxe4 was best here? Black can play Ng3! White can't play Kxg3, unless he is prepared to give up his queen after Bd6+, but maybe White can struggle on with Nf3, although after Nxh1 approximate material equality has been regained, and Black still has the attack?} 15. Qd5 {I wanted to stop the bishop check on c5} Be6 {But this causes problems. If 16 Qb5, then Qd4 is a horrible check. There is a massive black squared weakness in my position!} 16. Qxe4 {So I comfort myself with more material!} Bc5+ {Now Kf1 is likely to be met with a horrible knight check on e3 at some stage, so I have only one choice.} 17. Ke1 {Post-match computer now gives black a 1.88 advantage. Where did I go wrong?} Qxb2 {So black re-coups some material.} 18. Rd1 {Perhaps it will be a case of "Safety in numbers" around my king.} Qc3+ {Post-match computer gives this as a mistake, leading to an advantage of just 0.01 for Black, instead of Ne3 maintaining the adavantage of 1.88. I think this view is questionable!} 19. Rd2 {Virtually forced, 19. Kf1 Ne3+ looks terminal.} Bb4 {Threat Qxd2} 20. Qd3 {So I play this, hoping for QxQ or QxR. I'd be overjoyed to give back the exchange to get queens off the board.} Qa1+ {But he doesn't fall for that!} 21. Bd1 {Forced again. If Kf2, Bc5+ and White has to give up his queen.} Kg7 {Attacking my knight. Perhaps it would be better to play Nc7 or Ne2, but I decide to counter-attack his knight on f5, which has been causing me problems.} 22. g4 {Now, rook takes knight, pawn takes knight, bishop takes pawn f5 and I am still in the game. Unfortunately Black finds another excellent sacrifice.} Bxc4 {Oops, I am more-or-less forced to take.} 23. Qxc4 {And he now grabs back the exchange} Bxd2+ {May as well recapture.} 24. Kxd2 Rd8+ {Although I am still a rook up, white's position is hopeless. Ng1 and Rh1 are still out of the game, Na8 is not doing much, while the Bd1 is a goner. Where did I go wrong?} 25. Ke2 {Post-match computer now puts Black 2.26 up} Qxd1+ {At least I have got rid of his black squared bishop. Will my king finally find sanctuary on f2?} 26. Kf2 Qd2+ {Unlikely!} 27. Ne2 {I decided to at last develop my king's knight. Post-match computer gives this as a massive mistake, and rates my position as minus 8.33 and gives 27. Qe2 Qd4+ 28. Kg2 Ne3+ 29. Kg3 Rxa8 30. Qb5 Rc8 31. Ne2 Qd6+ 32. Kh3 Rc2 33. Re1 Qd5 34. Qxd5 Nxd5 35. a4 f6 as best for both sides, and black 2.4 ahead. The ending is clearly winning for Black - he is a pawn ahead and his pieces are still on better squares, but I'm not convinced that black has to even go into an ending. } Qe3+ {No peace for the wicked!} 28. Kg2 Rd2 {I finally move my rook, although post-match computer gives Re1 as another error.} 29. Re1 Nd4 {And I resigned. Your comments would be most welcome, and please don't forget to rate this annotation!}
