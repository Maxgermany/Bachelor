1. e3 {This is a game I played recently OTB. The opponent is a young 2nd category player on the rise.   I decided to put the game on Gameknot because it has some interesting moments and can be somewhat educational. I will focus on my thinking during the game and not necessarily on computer analysis for "absolutely best moves".   First move is actually transpositional, as I play e6 very often as Black. I wanted to see how he will react, hopefully with 1...e5 so I can play the reversed Sicilian with extra move.} d5 {Pretty good reply, straightforward occupation of centre.} 2. b3 {With this move I am showing my intent to play 1.b3 system, where e3 is a natural part of White's development.} b6 {Black decides to counter in the same manner. This is on the surface not entirely natural due to closed diagonal (d5 is played), but it is hard to stop d5 from moving forward later with tactical possibilities. The only good way is with d4 by White, which means that both Bishops will be closed behind their pawns.} 3. Bb2 Bb7 4. f4 {Classic strategy. White takes control of the black diagonal.} c5 {Black improves control of center and is not afraid of Bb5  due to sufficient defensive forces. Game is equal.} 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Bb5+ Nbd7 7. Ne5 a6 {This is necessary sooner or later. White will NOT take on d7 unless forced to do so. Beginners sometimes make that capture unprovoked but it is a loss of tempi - it is better to wait until Black has spent a move forcing the exchange.} 8. Bxd7+ {8.Bc6 is also possible, but I decided to play normally and just take the Knight.} Nxd7 9. O-O {I decided that there is no need to waste a tempi on Nd7. At this point I was just playing quickly and without much care, which almost backfired!} Nxe5 {Black wants to simplify the position and is preparing a nice trap, which unfortunately does not entirely work.} 10. Bxe5 {I wanted to keep the diagonal open. 10.fe5 is safer and better.} d4 {Very good shot! Now the Bishop is trapped and it looks like it will be captured.} 11. f5 {Only move - White opens an escape route for the Be5.} Qd5 {And here comes the main point. Double threat of Qe5 and Qg2# seems unstoppable.} 12. Qf3 {The only move and a good counterpoint. Now best is 12... Qf3; 13.gf3 with approximate equality (Black for preference though). 12...0-0-0 is another good option. } Qxe5 {?! Unfortunately, Black did not want to exchange Queens and captured the Bishop instead as he originally intended. After this White is better, due to better development (already castled). } 13. Qxb7 {Black threat of d:e3 is only optical, because Ra8 is hanging.} Rb8 {13...Rd8 is probably better, but White has the upper hand in any case.} 14. Qc6+ {Depriving Black of castling rights. 13...Rd8 would allow 14...Rd7 here so that's why it is likely a better move than 13...Rb8.} Kd8 15. Na3 {Very good move. Ra1 is now defended, and the Knight will go to c4 and then either b6 or e5 (-> f3).} Qc7 {Now it is too late. There is no way to force exchange of Queens, and Black has to be extremely careful not to allow any opening of the position or he will be mated soon. 15...de3; 16.de3,Qe3 ; 17.Kh1 is suicidal due to the opening of d file.} 16. Qd5+ {This check is not meant to really threaten the f7 pawn, but to keep the action tempi in White hands.} Ke8 17. Nc4 {Knight is entering the game. The pressure on Black position is now developing, slowly but surely and safely.} Rd8 {Black has to get rid of Qd5 before White can play Ne5 with threats on f7.} 18. Qe4 {The best move. Queen is very powerful here, and can not be easily forced to move away. White keeps his positional advantage and forces Black to find a plan for development.} g6 {Nice try. If 19.fg6, hg6 then Rh8 is suddenly an active piece with threats on h2! 18...b5 is an option, when White will play 19.Ne5 and later maybe Nf3 to put pressure on d4.} 19. a4 {Excellent positional move, probably the best move of the game. The point is that sooner or later Black will probably get fed up with Nc4 and play b5. In this case the a file will be of great use to White, whose Rooks are better positioned to take advantage from it. From experience I knew that a file can be useful not only positionally but also tactically (with Black King in the centre).} gxf5 {Black wants to open the g file, which is pretty much the only choice now that g6 is played. The f file is opening too though, so Black needs to keep an eye on f7. If 19...Bg7? then 20.f6!, Bf8 (20...Bh6?, 21.Nb6); 21.fe7, Be7; 22. Rf6! with advantage for White.} 20. Qxf5 e6 21. Qf6 {Keeping the action tempi for just a little longer.} Rg8 22. e4 {Another good move. Now all threats with d:e3 and Bg7 are stopped and Black lacks obvious counterplay.} Bg7 23. Qf3 {White has significant advantage now, but there is no clear path to the win due to the closed nature of the position (only f file is open). However, Black is lacking in active counterplay and has an unpleasant position which needs to be defended with great care - a situation where a lot of patience is needed.} b5 {? Black shows no patience :I he is using up his only active positional resource - but this is the last straw and his position will soon collapse. It is useful to remember a rule here: In passive position a player should not try to play active - it will only help his opponent.} 24. axb5 axb5 25. Na3 {Now there is no defence against 26.Nb5 with threat of 27.Ra7 with great pressure on f7.} Rb8 {?? Black missed the next tactical shot. Relatively best is 25...Rf8; 26.Nb5, Qb8; 27.Qg4 (threatens Bg7), Be5; 28.Ra7! with big advantage for White, for example 28...Bh2 ?; 29.Kh1, Rd7; 30.Rff7!, Rf7; 31.Qg8 } 26. Nxb5 {Now if Queen moves then 27.Ra7 wins easily.} Rxb5 {It doesn't matter anyway, but this final mistake speeds things up greatly.} 27. Ra8+ {After this Black resigned. There is no hope left.  What are (I hope) the learning points here?   1. White achieved nothing in the opening, which can be expected from a quiet positional system like 1.b3 2. After short tactical sequence, Black overstepped the risk limit when he allowed White to penetrate into his position. 3. White secured a lasting advantage and kept it SAFELY, always trying to keep the "action tempi" for himself. 4. Move 19.a4 is useful but not only that - it is positionally and tactically far-sighted, and counts on the psychological factors. 5. Left without any active counterplay, Black self-destructed quickly.  --- Thank you for looking over this game, I can answer any questions on private.  Regards,  Marin Vukusic}
