1. e4 e6 {The French Defense.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {The Winawer variation.} 4. e5 c5 5. Bd2 {A quiet continuation.  5. a3 is the more common move.  5. Bd2 signals white's interest in trading dark square bishops.} Ne7 6. Nb5 {Forcing the bishop trade and eyeing d6.} Bxd2+ 7. Qxd2 O-O 8. f4 {White needs the f-pawn to help secure the center.} a6 9. Nd6 cxd4 10. Nf3 Nbc6 11. Bd3 {Giving up a pawn in order to launch an attack.} f6 {A typical break in the French defense.  Black often attacks a white pawn chain at the head as well as at the base of the chain.} 12. O-O Bd7 13. Qe1 {Supporting the e-pawn and facilitating the queen's transfer to the kingside via the e1-h4 diagonal.} Nc8 {Black forces the d6 knight's exchange.} 14. Nxc8 Rxc8 15. a3 {To prevent 15. Nb4.} fxe5 16. fxe5 h6 {Creating a white square weakness around the king, but black has to make some conssession.} 17. Qg3 Ne7 {Black covers the white square on g6 just in time.} 18. Nxd4 {A mistake.  A move such as 18. Kh1 would've been better.} Qb6 {Ouch!} 19. Qe3 Qxb2 20. Rxf8+ Rxf8 21. Re1 {White is a pawn down with diminished attacking chances.} Qxa3 {Oops.} 22. Bh7+ {A classic clearance sacrifice, where the bishop forces black to respond to the check while the queen on a3 is left hanging. 1-0.  }
