1. c4 {starts with the English opening} e5 2. Nc3 Qf6 3. e4 Bc5 {open up obvious scholars mate position } 4. f3 {easily stoped} Nh6 {bringing in knight } 5. Nge2 Ng4 {play an attempted sacrificial move to get mate} 6. d4 {goes horribly wrong} exd4 7. Nd5 {knight creates a fork of the queen and pawn on c7 that would create another fork and win the rook but i dont see this} Qg6 8. fxg4 {takes knight} Qxg4 {this move should have been spent protecting c7} 9. Nxc7+ {fork} Kd8 {i lose a rook} 10. Nxa8 Qxe4 {i attempt to gain a good position} 11. b3 {that move ends up a very bad move } Qf5 {queen back} 12. Nxd4 {knight takes pawn} Qe4+ {i hope threefold repartition } 13. Ne2 {i hatch a plan} Qf5 {back again} 14. Nd4 {back again} Qe5+ {check} 15. Qe2 {queen defends} Qxd4 {i take knight and guess what he does  a)defends rook   b) check} 16. Bg5+ {b)} f6 {guess what he does next  a) defends rook  b) defends bishop } 17. Bh4 {b)} Qxa1+ {i take rook, as i said earlier, b3 was not a bad move but it did allow me to win eventually.    some people would have advised pinning the queen but that would have lost a rook giving me four points but this won me the game} 18. Qd1 {defends} Bb4+ {check} 19. Ke2 Re8+ {separates king and queen, he resigns, would you have???}
