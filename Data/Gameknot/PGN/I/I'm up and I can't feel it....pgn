[Opening "Scandinavian defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {My usual Scandinavian...} 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Bc4 {...that in this case (the only one I know) can't be followed by the Icelandic gambit, since after the exchanges black will have an isolani on the e column... not any good!} Nxd5 {So this is the profilactic move. But I am on almost unexplored threads. } 4. Qf3 {Classic opening trick. It is either a naive attack or a nasty trick I should know. } e6 {Cautiosly, and blocking in my lsb (which is the beginning of my disgrace...} 5. d3 Nc6 {N looks as if to threat c7, but if fact he is aiming to e5, forking Q and B and resolving the tension in the center. } 6. c3 {White, as foreseen, must defend c7 against the knight's jumps, so I go...} Ne5 7. Bxd5 {White reacts, and it seems a blunder. Now, I can take with the queen and the game is even. Or I can...} Nxf3+ 8. Bxf3 Qxd3 {I am +4, and it seems I am winning. } 9. Be3 Qc2 {I wonder how can white defend b7 and develop, but I was dead wrong. } 10. Nd2 Qxb2 11. Rb1 Qxc3 {+6. A N pinned. Relatively safe Q. b2 is lost, but I would welcome to exchange one of white's bishops. It is starting to look hard for me to develop. } 12. Ne2 Qa5 13. O-O {I though about Bb4 here, but Nc4 was awaiting me. Qxa7 would have been to insist on the classical "too greedy" mistake I was already in. } c6 {Guarding b2. I have to solidify, but in doing so, I wasn't answering the question "where to develop my lsb? How to bring the rooks into the game? How bitter feel all those pawns. } 14. Nc4 Qa6 15. Rfc1 {Can you believe it? I am under heavy fire! My opponent well could have sacrified the Queen on purpose! I hunger for good moves. } Be7 16. a3 O-O 17. Bd4 Bd7 {+6 and I should think about f6-e5 to win some manouver space. } 18. Ne5 Rfd8 {Welcome, Bad Bishop's exchange!} 19. Be3 {White is too wise for that. } Be8 {f6 was coming into consideration, but I wasn't sure at all about opening the game. I needed control. } 20. h3 {Ok, white will get me by hunger, with waiting moves until I lose my temper. Which I am very willing to do, in spite of a counter unbalanced exchange that can rid off some of white's overwhelmigly well placed pieces. } Bxa3 21. Rba1 {As foreseen. } Bxc1 22. Rxa6 Rd1+ {Just to win a tempo for doubling rooks. } 23. Kh2 bxa6 {Sad necessity. I will lose a minor piece, leaving him the bishop's pair. But at least I had some mobility with my two rooks. } 24. Nxc1 Re1 {? Blunder. Bd7 and I will have to work hard to even save the R from an exchange. } 25. Nc4 Rb8 26. Nd3 {I am dangerously driving his pieces to open field, knowing that minor piece's weakness against the rooks it the "two undefended sided pieces" situation. } Ra1 27. Bxa7 Rbb1 {Now is where, if white plays as I suppose, I'll get him in a sided undefended situation. } 28. Bd4 Ra4 {That's it. Of course, white has the other knight, so...} 29. Ndb2 {Now, I will lose a rook for two minor pieces. I am +4 now, I will be +6 then, but I will lose some of the lonely pawns on the kingside. I can hope just to be an exchange and a pawn up. And with the feeling to have fooled a horrible death. } Rxb2 {Now, of course white should have taken with the bishop, keeping the pair, but...} 30. Nxb2 {A blunder, since in such a position the bishop pair is most valuable. } Rxd4 {Now the game, sadly, loses interest, but it is still an unbalanced game...} 31. Kg3 g5 {I can play c4, of course, but I liked to speculate on the king itself. } 32. Bh5 Kg7 33. Nd1 Kh6 34. Bf3 f5 35. Kh2 e5 36. Ne3 {Nasty threat, but all is under control. } Kg6 {Bh5+ doesn't work because there is no check fork on Nxf5. } 37. g4 Rf4 {...wanting to play risky. All went as predicted: } 38. gxf5+ Kf6 39. Bg4 Rxf2+ 40. Kg1 {...and here my opponent abandoned the game. My queen pawns will cost white a piece each, and then, my rook will win. }
