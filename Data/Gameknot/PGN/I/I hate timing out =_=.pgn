1. e4 {It'll take me a while to get over the horrible, horrible first game I played. My ego was screwed and I was unconfident...  To whoever saw what I wrote before, I'm sorry, but I got Harzer and Ludwig mixed up. I won against Ludwig, but it was a timeout... I have nothing but respect for Harzer. He's a nice player!} c5 {... I didn't uderstand this opening... >_>;;} 2. g3 {Since I have nothing better to do... FLANCHETTO!} Nc6 {Maybe it's a new opening?} 3. c3 e5 {NOW he brings out that freakin' pawn...} 4. f4 Bd6 5. Ne2 exf4 6. gxf4 Nf6 7. Bg2 Bxf4 8. Nxf4 {Not too sure what he was trying to accomplish there... that pawn wasn't THAT much of a threat, was it?} g5 9. Ne2 Qa5 10. O-O Ng4 11. Ng3 h5 12. Nf5 {Knights look better when they can't be captured near the middle of the board, no?} c4 {I have no idea what he was aiming for... to stop my moving d3 or b3?} 13. Nd6+ {My knight wants a two-for-one deal >:-3} Kd8 14. Nxf7+ Ke7 15. Nxh8 Nce5 16. h3 Nf6 {those knights become a pain in my ass later (for the short run). Watch them.} 17. b4 {I didn't like half my board not being used. <_<;;} Qc7 18. Bf3 g4 19. hxg4 hxg4 20. Be2 Nxe4 {Y'know, that knight combo on the pawn was REALLY annoying me. How considerate of him to move it for me! <3} 21. Bxg4 d5 {Is he drunk?} 22. Bh5 Bg4 {All I gotta say is W. T. F!?! In order to protect a pawn that wasn't in danger, he let my bishop escape. and to capture my bishop, he throws his at me!} 23. Bxg4 {Hey, Who am I to not take what's offered to me?} Kd6 {. . . I have no clue what is going on in this guys head...} 24. Bf5 {Time to GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE, BISHOP!!} Qb6+ 25. d4 {En passant or whatever would have REALLY F*cked me over right there. Anyone agree?} Nxc3 {He Swings and hits the WRONG TARGET...} 26. Nxc3 {Ca-ching!} Qxb4 {that trade was acceptable...} 27. Qe1 {Protect the knight, Attack the knight.  I am made of WIN tonight!} Rxh8 {Ouch. I forgot about him...} 28. Bf4 {Pin that sucker!} Rg8+ 29. Kf2 {run like a chicken with my head cut off!} Qb2+ 30. Qd2 {I'm perfectly willing to go Queen for Queen at this point. Wouldn't you?} Qb6 {"Know what's coming? PAIN is comming!"} 31. Qe3 Qb2+ 32. Ne2 c3 33. Qxe5+ Kc6 34. Qe6+ {I'll Avenge you, my brave, dead knight! You may be gone, but you are NOT forgotten!!} Kb5 35. Qxd5+ Kb4 36. Bd6+ Ka4 37. Bd7+ b5 {THAT threw me off guard...} 38. Qxg8 {knight avenged.} c2 {Why? Just WHY?! With two rooks there, all they can promote that pawn to is pain...} 39. Kf3 Qa3+ {That's a death-trap. That entire area was a kill-zone for the Queen.} 40. Bxa3 {see?} Kxa3 {ow.} 41. Qb3# {Now if only Jason could see this...}
