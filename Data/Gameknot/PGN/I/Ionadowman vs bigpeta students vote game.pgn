1. e4 {Vote game taking place over 14 months, from October of 2012 through December of 2013, played entirely by messages and diagrams on the bigpeta students club forum.  A very close game overall with neither side ever gaining a significant edge, the game swung to white in the endgame, perhaps beginning around move 34, and certainly between 34 and 42. } e5 {1...e5 received the majority vote.  Comments on 1...e5 vs 1...c5?} 2. Nf3 {2. Nf3} Nc6 {2...Nc6} 3. Bc4 {3. Bc4} Bc5 {3...Bc5} 4. O-O {4. O-O} Nf6 {4...Nf6} 5. d4 {5. d4. setting up the open theme of the early part of the game.} Bxd4 {5...Bxd4. black goes a pawn up here.  but white gains some running room.} 6. Nxd4 {6. Nxd4} Nxd4 {6...Nxd4} 7. Be3 {7. Be3. Knight attacked twice.} Nc6 {7...Nc6. } 8. Nc3 {8. Nc3.  three developed pieces plus a mobile queen for white to two and and a not so mobile queen for black.  } h6 {8...h6.  keeping the knight unharried but watch what happens at move 12.} 9. f4 {9. f4. placing a lot of value in open lanes, white opens things up in advance of a bold B for P exchange he'll attempt at move 12.   } exf4 {9...exf4} 10. Bxf4 {10. Bxf4.  } d6 {10...d6. still only two pieces out in play, this gives the bishop a path into the game.} 11. Nd5 {11. Nd5.  Only move 11 and black is pushing for another exchange, five units already off the board.  Does he have his eyes on moving right to an endgame?  Why this move instead of a rook or queen move? } O-O {11...O-O. and...} 12. Bxh6 {12. Bxh6.  chomp! a free pawn for white, ...equalizes blacks earlier capture at move 5.  the black team agrees that white can bring too much power to bear too quickly to justify recapture.  would this pawn have made THE difference in the endgame?  Commenters, what is the lesson here?  Difficult to know at move 8 that white would take such an aggressive line.  Should black not have castled?  Should they have played 11...g5? Should they capture the bishop?} Ng4 {12...Ng4.  The focus moves to the tactically interesting e3 square.  When all is said and done, that square amounts only to a place where significant resources on both sides are expended.  question: if white can probably outplay black in an endgame, then an even exchange at any point in the game actually favors white and is therefore not even. comments?} 13. Bf4 {13. Bf4} Nce5 {13...Nce5.  Here, black has made SIX knight moves while three pieces remain unmoved.  Nevertheless, black is not in awful shape and white does have an isolated pawn while black does not.  Ion, Pete, analysts, any comments here about white's e-pawn? } 14. Bb3 {14. Bb3.  } c6 {14...c6.  one less piece guarding e3.} 15. Ne3 {15. Ne3} Qb6 {15...Qb6, pinning the knight and attacking e3 twice.} 16. Qd2 {16. Qd2 easily defends. White does not bite on the poisoned pawn on d6 (avoiding potential trouble including the possible loss of his queen, for example  16.	Qxd6	Nxe3 17.	Qxe5	Nc4+ 18.	Be3	Qxe3+ 19.	Rf2	Nxe5).} Be6 {16...Be6.  frustration for black at not having a more interesting option for the B.  Is 16...Be6 a mistake?  should black have played ...Bd7 or toward ...Bb7, ...for the purpose of conserving some material?  or was it sensible to take this long diagonal away from white?} 17. h3 {17. h3.  forces black to decide the personality of the rest of the game. } Nxe3 {17...Nxe3.  simplifying.  fine IF black can match white's endgame.  a big IF.  Lengthy discussion leading to this move here http://gameknot.com/club-fm.pl?club=981&th=15558&pg=2 and http://gameknot.com/club-fm.pl?club=981&th=15558&pg=3} 18. Qxe3 {18. Qxe3} Qxe3+ {18...Qxe3+ the first of the game's two checks.} 19. Bxe3 {19. Bxe3. and the queens are off the board.  how was it Carlsen demolished Anand? better endgame play? black is still fully in the game here.  but Ion/archduke_piccolo is probably happy to wait patiently for the endgame.  would black may have been better off NOT initiating the exchange sequence?  Comments?} Bxb3 {19...Bxb3.  committing further to the game being decided by kings and pawns.  while black may have been right to avoid an island of one pawn (on g7), white's pawns play perfectly well in the endgame despite any slight weakening here. } 20. axb3 {20. axb3.  note that innocent pawn on b2 which turns out to be a key piece in the endgame, ...not by making a dramatic capture or being promoted but by assuring white of critical control over whose move it is when the kings stand opposed. } a6 {20...a6.  Freeing the rook.  In the sequence to follow, black does well to avoid getting into trouble, but at the same time gains no advantage.} 21. Rad1 {21. Rad1} Rad8 {20...Rad8.  remaining rooks finally get into the game.} 22. Rd2 {22. Rd2} f6 {22...f6.  maneuvers toward doubling rooks on both sides.} 23. Rfd1 {23. Rfd1} Nf7 {23...Nf7.  that pawn on e4 seems to have worked out fine for white and makes black contort into this awkward position.} 24. Bb6 {24. Bb6} Rd7 {24...Rd7} 25. Bc5 {25. Bc5.  d6 attacked 3x.} Ng5 {25...Ng5.  counterattack relieves the cramped position.} 26. Rd2xd6 {26. Rxd6 capturing black's d pawn.} Rxd6 {26...Rxd6} 27. Bxd6 {27. Bxd6} Rd8 {27...Rd8. pinning the bishop.} 28. Rd4 {28. Rd4 and black should re-equalize by trading N for B+P or R for R+P.} Nxe4 {28...Nxe4} 29. Bc5 {29. Bc5.  it will be the rooks.  } Rxd4 {29...Rxd4} 30. Bxd4 {30. Bxd4} f5 {30...f5} 31. g4 {31. g4} fxg4 {31...fxg4.  a good decision? could black have done well making passed pawn with 31...f4? discussion here http://gameknot.com/club-fm.pl?club=981&th=16595} 32. hxg4 {32. hxg4.} Kf7 {32...Kf7} 33. Kg2 {33. Kg2} Nf6 {33...Nf6} 34. Kf3 {34. Kf3} g5 {34...g5.  this was a controversial move and may be the first nail in the coffin.  better perhaps to have kept control of f5 and live on a white (bishop-proof) square for a while.  this move allows the white king access to f5 and requires that black guard the pawn more than if it had moved to g6.} 35. Bb6 {35. Bb6} Nd5 {35. Nd5} 36. Bd8 {36. Bd8} Kg6 {36...Kg6.  king must protect the pawn.  if black had played 34...g5 instead of 34...g6...,  could the king have played a stronger role, ...able to move to the center and toward whites' pawns on the b and c files?} 37. Ke4 {37. Ke4 further suppressing black's king and threatening Ke5.} Nf6+ {37....Nf6+ attempts to mitigate. The second of the game's two checks.} 38. Bxf6 {38. Bxf6} Kxf6 {38...Kxf6.  gives the black K some freedom but now white's lifetime of endgame experience can really come in to play.  can black still win or draw at this point?} 39. b4 {39. b4} b6 {39...b6.  a popular move at the time, discussion is here http://gameknot.com/club-fm.pl?club=981&th=16595&pg=4 .  But it may be that a K move was the better way to go.  Perhaps Pete and Ion will help us understand how we might have approached these last few moves more correctly.} 40. Kd4 {40. Kd4} Ke6 {40...Ke6} 41. c4 {41. c4 and black is running low on moves.} Kd6 {41...Kd6. black aims for a draw.} 42. Ke4 {42. Ke4 ...but white sees a path to a win.} Ke6 {42...Ke6 stays with the draw theme but is fatal (if not post-fatal).} 43. b5 {43. b5.  white has calculated that this sequence is winning.  black was able to calculate after the fact but needed to be more proactive.  speaking as one member of the black side, the idea that we may have had an easy route to a draw contributed to too little concern toward figuring out the truth of the position several moves ago!  an important homework assignment therefore is working to understand what we should have known and when.} cxb5 {43...cxb5} 44. cxb5 {44. cxb5} a5 {44...a5. } 45. b3 {45. b3.  all having analyzed and finding only long roads to a loss, black resigns.  well played for most of the game by the black team.  but the archduke's perfectly calculated endgame play won out.  comments and discussion should be interesting, particularly as concerns the endgame.  It is probable that with perfect play black could have engineered at least a draw.  Hopefully we will identify where things went off track.}
