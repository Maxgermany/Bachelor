1. e4 {This miniature game was played on ICC. I've started to try to use e4, especially in Blitz games as I've played d4 almost exclusively as White. } e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nfd7 6. h4 {Alekhine's Attack. The more gut move, Bxg5 leads to poor prospects for black (as we will see). Best is to ignore the odd pawn thrust and take more center with the thematic freeing move of the french, c5. } Bxg5 7. hxg5 Qxg5 8. Nh3 {Now White will keep his lead in development, a fine price for the pawn. } Qe7 9. Qg4 {This move offers plenty of attacking possibilities and I had expected to see 9... g6 or maybe 9... g5. Instead Black castles into the onslaught and allows for a rook sacrifice and a quick mate. } O-O 10. Ng5 h6 11. Rxh6 gxh6 12. Nxe6+ Kh7 13. Qg7# {}
