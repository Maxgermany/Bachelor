1. Nf3 {I'm back after a chess break.  Here is a game I played on the ICC at a 1 minute time control.} d5 {The main line Reti, however, this can transpose into the Catalan or after 3. d4 any number of 1. d4 lines.} 2. c4 {Khalifman and Kramnik both recommend 2. d4 here, as 2...d4 (a reverse Benoni) can be a little uncomfortable if you are not used to it, however, the extra tempo only benefits white.} dxc4 {Black chooses to abandon the center and maybe try to hold the pawn.} 3. e4 {A little played continuation, which Nigel Davies advocates in his book on the Reti and a continuation that I employ frequently for its shock value.  3. e3 would lead to lines similar to the QGA.} c6 {Trying to hold the pawn with 3...b5 is to weakening after 4. a4 c6; 5. ab cb; 6. b3!  3...Nf6; 4. Bxc4 Nxe4? and white can recover the pawn with a cute little tactic.  Can you figure it out?  The correct move is 3...c5, taking advantage of the dark-squared weakness.} 4. Bxc4 {White's position is being readied for a direct assault on the black king.} e6 {Black falls further behind in development.  4...Nf6 was probably better.} 5. O-O { } Bd6 { } 6. d4 {best.} Ne7 {Black's development is a little cramped.} 7. Nc3 { } O-O {Not a bad move, but in this quick time control, the attack will be very quick.} 8. Bd3 {Setting up the trap!!} Na6 {??  Allowing the Greek Gift sacrifice on h7.} 9. e5 {Clearing the line to h7 with tempo.} Bb8 10. Bxh7+ {The attack begins.} Kxh7 {After 10...Kh8; 11. Ng5 g6; 12. Qf3 Nf5; 13. Bxg6! decides the game in White's favor.} 11. Ng5+ {Check!} Kg8 {11...Kg6 is the best defense, however, it still loses after 12. Qg4. } 12. Qh5 {Mate is unavoidable.} Re8 { } 13. Qxf7+ { } Kh8 { } 14. Qh5+ {The standard mating mechanism in this position.} Kg8 { } 15. Qh7+ {Here I let the ball drop, White is still winning, but Black can forstall mate by sacrificing material.} Kf8 { } 16. Qh8+ { } Ng8 { } 17. Qh5 { } Qe7 {?????? 17...Nh6 keeps him afloat for a little while longer.} 18. Nh7# { }
