1. d4 {my standard way of beginning} e6 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 b6 {I don't think this is the best, it allows me full control of the center} 4. e4 Bb4 5. Bd3 O-O {After my 5ยบ move I would have waited a little longer to castle! } 6. e5 Ne8 {The only possibility, which shows already some troubles!} 7. Qe2 {The threat is obvius (Qe4), but still, I have second thoughts on this one} Qh4 {F5 was the best option, along with Bb7, because this allows} 8. Nf3 Qh5 9. g4 {Ups! my anxiety is stronger! Qe4 looks better (g4 doesn't look bad either!)} Qxg4 {Only one. Qh3 loses a pawn after Kg5} 10. Rg1 Qh5 11. Rg5 Qh3 12. Bf4 Bb7 {F5 still better} 13. Ng1 Qh4 {I was very close to do the same final combination, but I realized that after the queen takes the bishop, it goes back to h6!} 14. Be3 Qxh2 {Again, f5 was necesary.} 15. Rh5 {Final destination, the king's castle!} Qxg1+ 16. Kd2 {We are all in, Qf1 was out of the quetion.} Qxa1 {Thans God he did it. His final chance was to accept his mistakes with Qg6, and after Bxg6, take with the F pawn, and that would have given me some heavy work, but, I would still have the upper hand!} 17. Bxh7+ {Finally, let's take the king to dance!} Kh8 18. Bg6+ Kg8 19. Rh8+ {Would you mind coming back to h8?} Kxh8 20. Qh5+ Kg8 21. Qh7# {I really enjoyed this game, specially because fire works are not my strength! Nevertheless, it all came possible thanks to my opponent greed! I hpe you liked it as well!}
