1. d4 {This is my rematch against Sean after he snagged me in an early checkmate last game.  Things do not go too well in this game as I try to make a QGD into a stonewall.  } d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {Fighting for d5} 4. e3 e6 5. Bd3 Nbd7 6. f4 {I set my sights on e5 as a possible post for a knight} Bb4 7. Bd2 Bxc3 8. Bxc3 dxc4 9. Bc2 {Having set my mind on attacking kingside, I didn't recapture black's pawn.  A simple mistake, and a great example of being too narrow-minded.  I didn't even see that the recapture was possible.  } O-O 10. Nf3 b5 11. O-O Nd5 12. Ne5 {I set my knight on e5, looking into black's kingside.} Nxe5 {Black instantly captures my knight!} 13. Bxh7+ Kxh7 14. Qh5+ {Having my knight on e5 traded, I sort of panic and pull the trigger too soon, and we will be fighting for position for a while.} Kg8 15. fxe5 f5 16. Rf3 {After I recaptured the knight on e5, I need to guard my pawn on e3} Qe8 17. Qh4 Kf7 18. Rh3 Qe7 19. Qh7 Ke8 20. Qg6+ Qf7 {I cannot trade queens.  I am down material!} 21. Qh7 Kd8 22. Be1 Qg8 23. Qh4+ Kc7 24. Bb4 {I am trying to get behind black's pawns, but make a blunder in the same process.  Luckily black does not see the free bishop and moves his rook.} Re8 25. Bd6+ {I do get my bishop onto a helpful square.   Now I have a little more power on black's side.} Kb7 26. Qe1 a5 27. a4 b4 28. Rf3 {After planting my bishop on d6 and seeing black's king moved over to the queenside, I move my forces over there.} Bd7 29. Qe2 Nb6 30. e4 g6 31. Qe1 Nc8 32. Qe2 {I should have realized that black would gladly trade pieces.} Nxd6 33. exd6 Red8 34. Qxc4 {Still trying to gain space on black's queenside.} Be8 35. e5 Bd7 36. Rc1 g5 37. Qd3 g4 {I believe I was planning on moving my rook to c4 before black attacked my other rook.  This gave me an opportunity to have all my forces on the queenside.} 38. Rf2 Rdf8 39. b3 Qg5 40. Rfc2 Qf4 41. Rc2c4 Qe4 42. Qd2 f4 43. Re1 Qg6 44. Rec1 f3 {Now I need to be careful.  black's pawn advances are taking away the time I need to develop an attack.} 45. Rxb4+ {I sacrifice my rook to get my queen behind enemy lines.} Ka6 {sensing danger, black does not take the rook with the a pawn.  } 46. Rbc4 f2+ 47. Kf1 g3 {Now black's pawns are really serious business.} 48. Qc3 {I force black to move his rook to prevent mate via 49.Rc6+ Bxc6 50.Qxc6+ Ka7 51.Qc7 Ka6 52. Rc6++} Rac8 49. h3 {I wasn't sure what else to do.  I needed to do something about the encroaching pawns, this saves me from dealing with an extra queen.} Qe4 50. Rc5 {Targeting a5} Kb7 {Avoiding checkmate from 51.Rxa5+ Kb7 52.Qb4++} 51. Rd1 {Blocking the d3 square that black's queen would need to stop checkmate after Qxa5} Qg6 {The queen gives up her attack, and the game is over mate in 3.} 52. Qxa5 Rf4 53. Qb4+ Ka8 54. Ra5# {}
