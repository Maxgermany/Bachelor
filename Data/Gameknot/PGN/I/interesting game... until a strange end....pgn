1. d4 g6 2. e4 d6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Be3 Nc6 5. c3 e5 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. d5 Nce7 {Progressivly, white gain space} 8. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {black is clearly less developped} 9. Nbd2 Nf6 10. h3 {leaving black less and less possibilities} Nc8 {trying to find space on the queen side} 11. Qe2 Nb6 12. b3 {white continues the same tactic} Nh5 13. a4 Nf4 {this may seem a mistake, but my purpose was clearly to open spaces, even though my pawns would face doubling.} 14. Bxf4 exf4 {for a few moves, this pawn is safe... it won't last.} 15. Rc1 O-O 16. a5 {chasing the only piece from queen side. Maybe I should have played a5 sooner.} Nc8 17. Nd4 a6 18. Nd2f3 {white is still gaining spaces.} Ne7 19. Qd2 Be5 {preferring my pawn than this bad bishop. And more: white knights are dangerous.} 20. Nxe5 dxe5 21. Nf3 f6 22. c4 {main attack by white: the pawns!} Rad8 23. O-O c6 24. Kh2 Qd6 {mistake!} 25. c5 {of course!} Qb8 26. d6 Rf7 {knight cannot be taken due to queen esposition.} 27. Qe2 Nc8 {focusing the only possible target: b5.} 28. Rcd1 Na7 29. Qc4 {and now, white will try to penetrate with this advanced pawn...} Kg7 {freeing the pinned rook} 30. Rfe1 {maybe this was a loss of time} Rdd7 {combining the rooks for their safety and overprotecting b7.} 31. Qe6 {i think that white forgot to use his knight.} h6 {reducing possibilities of the white knight in case of king-side pawns advancing.} 32. Rd3 {white still lacks of ideas: there is no possibility to advance on d-line with the rooks.} Nb5 {prohibiting many possibilities from white} 33. b4 Qd8 34. g3 {finally a good attacking move} fxg3+ {forced} 35. fxg3 {white has oppened a good line: it was the thing to do!} Rf8 {preparing the exchange of queen to avoid a task force against f6} 36. h4 {preparing the attack} Qe8 37. Qh3 {the queen wants to still focusing on d7; good idea.} Qf7 {focusing on the other side, threatening an intermediate check if possible} 38. Rf1 {preparing the attack on f6, with an advance against g5} Rfd8 39. h5 {my mistake... it was on h5. The knight can now go on h4} g5 {not anymore... but this is where white stopped to play. This is too bad, because I was planning a draw and the good possibilities on f6 were interesting for white...the last soldier for black could be the knight on d5, in case the rook on d column leaves its place to focus on column... well, many things, many things!}
