[Black "Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen "]
[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C60), Cozio defence"]

1. e4 {Zukertort had white pieces and he started with e4.} e5 {Anderssen responded with e5} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {After Nf3, Nc6, Bb5 we have Ruy Lopez opening.} Nge7 {Nge7 was played, and this is known as the Cozio defence.} 4. c3 {C3 was played, the idea was simple, d4 is coming next.} d6 {D6 was played, very natural looking move, so the lsb can be developed.} 5. d4 {D4, d5 is coming next, to win the knight. } Bd7 {exd4 is possible, but black played Bd7 breaks the pin.} 6. O-O {White simply castles king side.} Ng6 {Ng6, seems black wants to play Be7 next and castle king side.} 7. Ng5 {Ng5 was played, attacks f7 pawn.} h6 {h6, looks logical, black wants to kick the knight away, however here comes the first shocking move.} 8. Nxf7 {Nxf7 what a move! The knight is forking the queen and the rook.} Kxf7 {Well, king must take.} 9. Bc4+ {It it's tempting to play Qf3+, but after king back to e8, black would have better chance to survive the attack, so it's critical to play the right move at this point. Bc4+ was played, the bishop is now dominating the a2 g8 diagonal, which restricts the king's position.} Ke7 {Ke7 was played, why not just play Be6 blocks the bishop? Because d5 would be disaster for black. However, I think ke8 would be a better move, because after white plays Qh5, black can play Qf6, also if white plays Qf3 treats mate, Qf6 can still be played, right? What do you think?} 10. Qh5 {Qh5 attacks the knight} Qe8 {Qe8 was played, and that's a blunder, if black played kf6 instead, he would survive much longer, although it looks risky, however because this Qe8 move, black jumped into his doom.} 11. Qg5+ {Here comes the earth shuttering move, Qg5+! What a fascinating move!} hxg5 {What else, hxg5 only move.} 12. Bxg5# {Goodbye Mr Anderssen, Bxg5#! What a immortal game! That's all guys, I hope you enjoy it, and see you next time.}
