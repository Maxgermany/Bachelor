1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 c6 {Most people go for more space when playing against the King's Indian Attack, but my opponent vies for solidity instead. This is a reasonable choice and usually ensures games that are more closely fought and subtle. } 4. O-O Bg4 5. d3 Nbd7 6. Nbd2 e5 7. e4 dxe4 8. dxe4 Bc5 {A good position for the bishop. Any other position would be too passive or precarious. } 9. Qe1 {This is to protect my e-pawn and to escape the pin from the bishop on g4. Commonly, Re1 is played here, though sometimes Qe1 works as well. } O-O 10. Nc4 {Now that my queen is out of the pin, I can start to use my knights more effectively. } Re8 11. b3 Qc7 12. Bb2 a5 13. Rd1 {From this move, it is clear the black wants to plan an assault on the queenside. White's focus is currently on the center, but usually shifts to the kingside in this opening. } b5 14. Ne3 Bh5 {Black has chased away my knight from the queen, but at a cost. I now have a reasonable outpost on f5 that controls vital center squares and is a precursor to attacking the king. } 15. Nf5 Rad8 {Black is developing, but does not seem to have a concrete plan to enact, whereas my plan is quite clear: attack the kingside. the d6 square can be occupied, but with little effect. } 16. h3 h6 17. Qe2 {Intentionally getting back into a pin to later to bring my queen in for the attack. I also wanted to join the rooks. } Bb6 {Black's plan is more clear: he wants to attack my center with a knight c5. } 18. g4 {The only problem is that my plan is bit faster. } Bg6 19. Nf3h4 Bh7 {Taking the knight on f5 immediately could have been better, to save him a tempo. } 20. Bc1 Bxf5 21. Nxf5 Nc5 22. g5 {The breakdown of Black's king's position begins here. } hxg5 23. Bxg5 Rxd1 {Getting out of a pin, but giving me nice access to the d-file temporarily. } 24. Rxd1 Nh7 25. Qg4 {Now the queen joins the forces with strong effect: tactics appear on the horizon in many places. } Nxg5 26. Qxg5 f6 {A crucial mistake. Black's best defense would have been Ne6, protecting the g7 pawn and attacking my queen simultaneously. } 27. Qg6 Rf8 28. Rd6 {I could have played Nh6+, but with nothing to gain. Letting the rook enter allows for tactics to be found. } Nb7 {Black misses the menacing tactics of the rook that I threatened. Possibly Kh8 or Rf7 was better.} 29. Rxc6 {If the queen takes, there can be an instant mate on g7 or a royal fork on e7.} Bxf2+ {Black's best response. } 30. Kxf2 Qf7 {Black once again does not recognize other tactics that are floating around. Better was Qd7.} 31. Nh6+ {Though my opponent played well throughout most of the game, his defense to my kingside attack was inaccurate and allowed tactics to flourish. Also to note is the speed of plans: black lost a tempo with a bishop retreat and chose to attack my center too late, or did not pressure me enough on the queenside. }
