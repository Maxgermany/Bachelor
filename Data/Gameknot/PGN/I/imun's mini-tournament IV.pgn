1. e4 {Best by test.} e5 {Standard.} 2. Nf3 {Book.} Nc6 {The most flexible response.} 3. d4 {Old-fashioned but playable.} exd4 {A must.} 4. Nxd4 {Forced.} Bc5 {Rather than exchange Knights immediately, which would centralize White's Queen, I play to develop and pressure the Knight.} 5. c3 {Securely guards the Knight but impedes the development of the Q-side.} Qf6 {Continuing to pressure the Knight.} 6. Be3 {Developing and guarding.} Nge7 {Preparing to castle.} 7. Nxc6 {Forcing my hand.} Bxe3 {To avoid losing material. If 8 PxB NxN (or QxN) keeps the balance.} 8. Nxe7 {A game that had been fairly tranquil, with relatively normal development and exchanges until now...} Qxf2# {...ends with this lightning-bolt!}
