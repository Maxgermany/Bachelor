1. e4 {This is my first annotated game, so I would be appreciative of any and all constructive criticism.} c5 {I've recently taken a liking to the Sicilian.} 2. a3 {I haven't studied this line, and this move seems pointless to me.  Could someone give me a continuation?} Nc6 {Going on with my usual development scheme.} 3. Nc3 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5 Nf6 6. Bxc6 {? Seems like a waste of time.  Better was probably 6.d4.} bxc6 {Capture towards the center and back up d5.} 7. h3 {This, again, wastes time.} d5 8. exd5 {I might have waited before taking here.} cxd5 9. d4 cxd4 10. Qxd4 {Bringing the queen in line with the enemy bishop is never a good idea.} O-O 11. Bg5 {This, along with the loose queen, concedes the bishop pair to me.} Ne4 12. Qe3 Nxg5 13. Qxg5 d4 {Gaining space.} 14. O-O-O {I pondered over an eventual Bh6, but realized it would probably never work.} e5 {Gives me more center control and space, while also unpinning my d-pawn next move.} 15. Qxd8 Rxd8 16. Ne4 f5 17. Nc5 {The knight's pretty useless and constricted here.} a5 18. Ng5 {Both knights are now loose and become targets of tactical play.} Rd6 19. c3 {? Drops a pawn.} e4 {This move does more than open the line for the bishop to attack c3...} 20. g4 {?? Mandatory was 20.h4, giving the knight a retreat square.} h6 {The knight is trapped!} 21. Ngxe4 fxe4 22. Nxe4 Rc6 {Adding a third attacker onto c3.} 23. Rd3 Ba6 24. Rf3 {Notice how passive white's pieces are.} Re8 {Bringing my last piece into play.} 25. Re1 {?? This walks straight into a pin and drops the other knight.  The move that loses outright.} Rce6 26. Rf4 dxc3 27. bxc3 Bb7 28. f3 {?? Again, blocking the rook's only retreat square.  The game is lost, but better lose a knight than a rook.} Bxc3 29. Re2 Be5 {And the rook is trapped!} 30. Nc5 Bxf4+ {My opponent must have missed the check that came with taking the rook here, but the game would be lost even if the king were on b1.  Good game, wcates.  I hope you all enjoyed.}
