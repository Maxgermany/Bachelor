1. e4 {So he starts with the usual.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {For my views on these moves, see http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/pen-y-ffordd-january-quickplay-round-2?gm=48272 Also see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sicilian#Open_Sicilian:_2.Nf3_and_3.d4} 6. g3 {Now this is slightly unusual. Fortunately I once fell into a trap, and played g6 7. Bg2 Bg7, allowing 8. Nxc6 bxc6 9. e5 with advantage to white. The desire to avoid this explains my next move.   } Bd7 {Protecting c6} 7. Bg2 {Continuing with my development.} g6 {and now I fianchetto too. My opponent said afterwards he thought this the strongest for black. The world opening database on Gameknot seems to bear this out.} 8. O-O {So he castles} Bg7 {I complete the fianchetto} 9. Nde2 {this is the usual move for white, avoiding tricks based on discovered attacks on his knight on d4.} O-O {Castling is logical} 10. h3 {This again is the most usually played move in this position} Ne5 {With a threat of coming in on c4} 11. b3 {Stopping the knight coming in, but allowing the following drawing sequence} Qc8 {Black hits h3 and c3} 12. Kh2 {The best way to protect h3. h4 or g4 just weaken the white king side. Now this position has been seen before. Zhang Jilin (2338) vs. Yeap Eng Cheam (2138) continued with Neg4+  13. Kh1 Nh6 14. g4 Bxg4 15. hxg4 Qxg4 with advantage to white, who won in 48 moves. Payen, Arnaud (2280) vs. Seres, Lajos (2450) continued with Qc5 13. Rb1 Rac8 14. Kg1 Nc6 15. Qd2 b5 16. Bb2 Ne5 17. Nd4 draw agreed. We found another way to end the game. } Nfg4+ {The point being Nfg4+ 13. hxg4 Nxg4+ followed by taking on c3 and black wins a pawn, so white cannot take. } 13. Kg1 {The best square} Nf6 {Black finds the best retreat} 14. Kh2 {White plays this again} Nfg4+ {Black throws in the check again, and a draw is agreed. Now I tested this position on the weak chess computer, Ludochess, which plays at about 1900. It thought that black is better, and rather than taking this draw, Qc5 gave black an advantage of 0.6 What do you think dear reader? Is black really better in this position? Has anyone got a stronger computer to check it on?  Generally, thanks for reading this annotation. Please leave a comment or two, rate my annotation, to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
