[Opening "Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 {The Trompowsky Attack!  Unusual but perfectly okay.  } h6 {?!  Not as good as the normal responses: Ne4, e6, or d5.  Still, this forces white to decide what to do with the bishop.} 3. Bh4 g5 {I decide to develop my kingside aggressively.  Perhaps Bg7, d6, and Bf5 are in the cards for me, leading to an interesting kingside presence and then most likely Nd7 and a queenside castle.} 4. Bg3 Ne4 {?!  Wasting time to go after the bishop when I know I should be playing either Bg7 or d6 (or even d5).} 5. Be5 {Also not a very strong move; sure it threatens the rook but white should be developing his pieces.} f6 {?!  This isn't a very good move; it exposes black's kingside significantly.  Better was Nf6 or Rg8.} 6. e3 {Such an innocuous move, when the only thing I had considered at this point was 6. Bg3 Nxg3 where white has a disrupted pawn structure and black can begin development.} fxe5 {??  Loses immediately.  A stupid capture that shows my blindness.  Why?} 7. Qh5# {Augh!  It's like Fool's Mate, and I fell for it!  Merry Christmas, NN.}
