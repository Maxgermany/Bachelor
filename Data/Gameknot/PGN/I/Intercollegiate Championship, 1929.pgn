Rc3 {Doubling Rooks on the open QB file will decide the issue at once.} d5 {In order to answer 22 KR-QB1 with 22... B-Q3 preventing 23 R-B7 ch.} 22. Qe5 {Threatens 23 R-B7 mate or 23 Q-B7 mate.} Qb6 {22... B-Q3 fails against 23 QxNP ch B-K2 24 BxB, as 24... RxB would lose the other Rook.} 23. Rec1 {Black resigns. White threatens 24 R-B7 ch and mate next move. If 23... B-Q3, 24 QxNP ch B-K2 25 BxB is decisive. An impressive example of incisive punishment of time-wasting Pawn-grabbing.}
