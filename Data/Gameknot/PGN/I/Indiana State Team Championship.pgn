1. e4 c5 {During the downtime between rounds I had a chat with my eventual opponent and found out that he has studied some of the theory of the Scotch opening. I decided to avoid a conflict based on theory I was not famliar with so I decided to stick to the Sicilian lines.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {Leading to quick castling. } e6 {Let him bit granite.} 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nf6 6. Nc3 Be7 {I was wanting to castle early as well, but I eventually delayed castling to the proper moment.} 7. h3 {My first thought was he was planning on storming my kingside with a pawn storm with Bishop and Queen support. While I had a half-open c file, I was starting to consider queenside castling.} Nc6 {Put the question to the knight. It is too important of a square to leave the knight unmolested for long.} 8. Bb5 {Yet another Bishop move. He will make several Bishop moves over the course of the game. } Bd7 {I wanted to maintain my pawn structure without having to move my queen around unnecessarily.} 9. Nxc6 bxc6 {I had considered exchanging the bishops off and having the pawn end up on c6 in the end but I decided to harass the Bishop some more. I would use the extra tempo to develop and establish control over the center. } 10. Bc4 Nxe4 {Here I noticed that I could have played the pawn fork had White taken the knight. My queen was not in danger since my rook was covering the back rank and he had not developed his dark squared Bishop yet.} 11. O-O Nf6 {I had considered exchanging off the knights but I wanted to keep the piece for the time being until I could develop another advantage or two. Numerous books have suggested the way of winning games was to accumulate little advantages so I decided to go along the same path.} 12. Qd3 {Back to lining up against the kingside and opening up the backrank to bring his A1 Rook into play after moving his Bishop. I saw that once he done that the b pawn would hang but I did not want to go pawn hunting with my king in the middle.} a5 {My plan at this point was to limit the scope of his Queenside while leading up to the pin of the knight in the likely event he would move his A file rook to E1.} 13. a3 d5 {I decided to harass the Bishop with a gain of tempo while simulataneously acquiring more space in the center. I knew that if I over-reached myself it would become a potential target so I decided to play things slowly.} 14. Ba2 Qc7 {Now leaving up the option of connecting both rooks once I castled while preparing for the E pawn advance. My plan was to chock the life out of White with gains in space.} 15. g3 {An unnecessary weakening of the pawns in front of the kingside. I knew that if I could somehow pin the F pawn I could take the pawn on g3 with check. This became a long term plan. But first I would have to castle and then open up the center files for my rooks. White still had not developed his dark squared Bishop at this point. I think he was trying to figure out what exactly I was going to do with my king first before committing to an attack.} e5 16. Kg2 {To protect the pawn. It was not a potential target at this time so this was sort of a waste of time. Development was more important.} O-O 17. Bg5 d4 {I knew this opened up the diagonal for the Bishop on A2 but I intended to attack the Knight and possibly opening up the B file for my rooks. Upon reflection this move was not a good idea. Better perhaps was h6, putting the question to the Bishop and removing the pawn from the Queens line of site.} 18. Bxf6 Bxf6 19. Ne4 {This was another potential downside to moving the D pawn. Now my center was grossly extended. } Be6 {My plan was to move both the g pawn and the f pawn to the right one file with the exchanges. I had the possibility of moving my King to H8 if the White queen moved to the kingside for a spite check. I figured that if White would exchange my Bishop for his Knight, he would have wasted several tempo to do so. Another thought that weighed in allowing the exchange was the fact it would open up the g file for my Rook, lining up against the White King. } 20. Nxf6+ gxf6 21. Bb1 {This move made no sense to me. He wanted to save his Bishop for a potential King side attack along with the Queen. I knew that I had time to get the pawns in front of my King into position where my Queen could cover the H pawn.} f5 22. c3 dxc3 {I knew he would not sac his Queen for the pawn so I would tie up White with the pawn exchange. Now I had my open D file for my rooks with the Queen right in the middle. If nothing else I would gain some tempos with the Rooks against the Queen.} 23. bxc3 Rfd8 {It was a matter of taste which Rook to move first. I wanted to the A file Rook to cover that file till I was ready.} 24. Qc2 Rd6 {Even if White moved his C pawn I would have both of my Rooks on this file first. I still controlled the center which turned out to be a long term plus.} 25. c4 Rad8 26. Qc3 {Attacking the unprotected pawn. However, I had the resource in place to protect with my doubled pawn. One of the few times a doubled pawn could be some benefit.} f6 27. Ba2 {Now White is thinking about the skewer against my King. Instead of allowing the exchange to happen on e6, I would move it back f7. But first I would have to deal with the attack on my Rook.} Rd6d3 {I am still eyeballing the G pawn. This move was to gain a tempo and allow for both of my Rooks to come into Whites camp with them lining up against White's kingside.} 28. Qb2 Rd3d2 29. Qc1 Rd8d3 {Now the pieces are in place to attack the kingside. All I would have to do now is to move my E pawn.} 30. Re1 {Giving himself a little breathing room for his King. I would also be a bluff of an attack against the center. Had White an extra tempo he could have played c3 but the pin prevented that.} e4 {Now the pieces are properly positioned. Time for the attack.} 31. Bb1 {Yet another Bishop move. Good idea. Just a little too late.} Qxg3+ {A hit, a very palpable hit.} 32. Kh1 Qxh3+ {Attack with a gain of material. It also lined up the King in the perfect position for the Rook on my next move.} 33. Kg1 Rg3+ {Here White resigned in light of the mate on next move following 34. fxg3 Qg2  .}
