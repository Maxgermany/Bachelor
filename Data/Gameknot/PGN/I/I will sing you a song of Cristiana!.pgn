1. d4 {Hi Everyone!  Ok, not quite the lady at Flambards but nevertheless, Cristiana certainly ended up as Lady Bountiful at the end of this game.  She was playing her mentor, Skorpio47 (aka Klaus) in a Walking the Walk and Learning to Run Welcome MT and she managed a Master Draw against him.  So, I want to learn from Cristiana's experience and just see how she did it.  This MT was a themed tournament called The Dutch Defense.  So, how did she do it?  Well read on......} f5 2. g3 g6 3. Nf3 Nf6 {3. ..... Nf6 - both sides get their king knights out.  A kingside fianchetto is on the cards for these players.} 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. Nc3 O-O {5. ..... 0-0 Cristiana tucks away her king on the kingside.  Kingside castling on both sides seems to be thematic to the Dutch.} 6. h4 {6. h4!  - allo, allo, allo?  Do we have a Freddy style white pawn advance on the kingside?} d6 7. Be3 {7. Be3 - normally this move would be a bit suspect, blocking in the e pawn.  At least there are no pieces on f1 to be blocked in though!} Ng4 {7. ...... Ng4 - and Cristiana's knight puts the question to that dsb.} 8. Qd3 Nxe3 9. Qxe3 {9. Qxe3 - and now there is a trade off.  Klaus has a choice, kingside or queenside castling - he defers it until move 14.} c6 10. h5 gxh5 11. Rxh5 {11. Rxh5 - meanwhile Klaus' heavies start to gather on the h file.  Can Cristiana muster a good enough defense before all three pile down on it or will Old Matey descend on h7?   We shall see. } Qe8 {11. ..... Qe8 - Cristiana's queen takes a leaf out of Glenda's book - she starts to cosy up to her partner and drive the invader out of her pos!} 12. Rh1 {12. Rh1 - back he goes!} e5 13. dxe5 dxe5 {13. ...... dxe5 - a counter in the centre and a pawn trade.} 14. O-O-O {14. 0-0-0 - queenside it is!} Na6 15. Kb1 {15. Kb1 - in a lot of games where the WK or BK goes queenside, a move to the b column is a common procedure.} Qe7 16. a3 Nc7 {16. ..... Nc7 - away from the rim!} 17. Qd2 e4 {17. ...... e4 - after a doubling on the d column, Cristiana effects a pawn stab.  Klaus puts the knight on a fairly active square, d4 where it will be chased again!} 18. Nd4 c5 {18. ..... c5 - pawn stab part 2!} 19. Nb3 b6 {19. ..... b6 - solid, but Cristiana must keep an eye on the h1-a8 diagonal because Klaus' bishop and Cristiana's rook are both on it!} 20. g4 Qf6 21. gxf5 Bxf5 {21. ..... Bxf5 - Cristiana responds to the pawn trade by developing her bishop.  She must still keep an eye on her QR though!} 22. Qc1 Rae8 23. Nd2 Qxc3 {23. ..... Qxc3 - allo, allo, allo, a queen sac!  What is going on here!?!} 24. bxc3 Nb5 25. Nxe4 Rxe4 26. Rd3 {26. Rd3 - yup, what is going on here?  Why not B x R??} Rxe2 27. Bd5+ Kh8 28. Bc4 Bxd3 29. Bxd3 Nxc3+ {29. ...... Nxc3+ - aha - there seems to be some method in the madness here?  Despite no BQ, will King Klaus cop Old Matey on the queenside?  Just look at that black dsb raking down the h8 - a1 column!} 30. Kb2 Re4 31. Qf1 {31. Qf1 - if BxR then Ne2 disc ch wins the WQ.} c4 32. Bxc4 Nd1+ 33. Kb3 Nxf2 {33. ..... Nxf2 - the crazy captures have not come to an end!} 34. Bd3 Nxd3 35. Qxd3 {35. Qxd3 - the only way to avoid dropping his Q.} Rfe8 36. Rh3 h6 37. a4 Re4e1 {37. .... Re1 - the attack continues.  Now Rb1+ is threatened.  I think King Klaus is just beginning to shiver a bit.  Klaus prevents this check by c3.} 38. c3 Re1e7 39. Rg3 Rc7 40. c4 Rec8 41. Qg6 {41. Qg6 - now Klaus' queen tries to counter-attack.  Note that the rook on c7 cannot move off the second rank because Cristiana's king will cop Old Matey!} Re7 42. Qd6 Rce8 43. a5 bxa5 {43. ..... bxa5 - Klaus has sacrificed a pawn.  What is he up to?} 44. Ka4 Re7e4 45. Qd7 Re8e7 46. Qc8+ {46. Qc8+ - one last check before both players decided to split the points.  What interesting play! That is my verdict, but do you the Inquest Jury agree on it?  I look forward to hearing your views.  Kind regards - Joanne}
