1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Bg5 {Maximum development: we strive - of course - for Nge2...  In fact, we have switched to Queens Gambit, where dxc4 is met with Bxc4...  5. ... Bb4 is going to be very demanding, for black; this is no Nimzo...} O-O 7. Nge2 {I made no illusions about, 7. Qb3 Re8+ 8. Be2 Nc6 9. 0-0-0 Be7 10. c5 Ne4 11. Be3...} Be6 {Highly irregular... I would at least have tried 7. ... dxc4 8. Qa4 a5 9. Qb5 c6 10. Qxc4, and after that, Be6... True?} 8. c5 {No second chance... After 8. Qb3, a5...} b6 {Another strange effort... One would expect 8. ... Re8 9. Qb3 Nc6 10. a3...} 9. a3 Bxc3+ 10. Nxc3 bxc5 11. dxc5 c6 {I would have preferred 11. ... h6 12. Be3 Ng4 13. Bd4 Nc6 14. Bb5...} 12. Be2 {Strictly spoken, Qd4 is best... But I wanted it at a4... Blacks queenswing is getting cramped...} Nbd7 13. O-O {Again, I see no special use for Qd4, h6, Be3...} h6 14. Bh4 {Surprise! We sac a pawn...} Nxc5 15. b4 Ncd7 {Blacks first real mistake... After 15. ... d4, white has lots to prove...  But this is blitz...} 16. Na4 {Out of the sleeve... White throws the position out of balance...} Qb8 {Slightly better may be 16. ... a5 17. Qd4 (just now!) g5 18. Bg3... Whites control over b8 gets nasty...} 17. Bg3 {Of course...} Qb7 18. Rb1 {A masterpiece... Now, after 18. Qd4, we get Bf5, rendering b1 useless... We win a crucial tempo...} Rac8 {Incomprehensable... The least black can consider, is 18. ... Bf5 19. Rb3...} 19. Nc5 Nxc5 {We got U! After 19. ... Qb6 20. Bd6 Rfe8 21. Bd3 a5, black has little to worrie about...} 20. bxc5 Qd7 21. Ba6 {The final blow... White is better... As well b6, b7 as b8 are in whites hands...  All tough it be, white has no direct threats, black resigns with 5 minutes on the clock, against 6...}
