1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {hmmmmmmmm the Berlin Defense.  time to break out the books for the best line against this solid defense.} 4. O-O a6 {this loses a pawn!  I believe this same error occurred in a correspondence game at instantchess.com.  } 5. Bxc6 bxc6 6. Nxe5 Qe7 7. Nf3 a5 8. Nc3 {the main thing white has to be careful of is getting careless with his center pawns else black will counterattack with c6-c5 and c7-c5 as I learned in a loss as white in a high school team match back in '71!} g6 9. d4 {the possibility of Bg5 emboldens me.} Qd8 10. Re1 Bb4 11. e5 Nd5 {I thought that ... Bxc3 was black's best chance here.  White should win with good play but it wouldn't be a done deal.} 12. Nxd5 cxd5 13. c3 Be7 14. Bf4 g5 {a surprising push but ...  0-0 practically begs for a mating attack.} 15. Be3 d6 {dropping another pawn!} 16. exd6 cxd6 17. Bxg5 {I thought this was a hasty move as 17 Nxg5 has some nice threats going for it but this is a strong move.} Be6 18. Qd2 {this makes the win more difficult.  the direct 18 Bxe7 forces Kxe7 as 18 ... Qxe7 would lose a piece to 19 c4!  } Rg8 19. Bxe7 Qxe7 20. c4 Qf6 {saving the piece.} 21. Re3 Kd7 {the most active move, connecting the rooks} 22. cxd5 Bh3 {this surprised me.  I had reckoned on seeing 22 ... Bxd5 to which I believe I had planned 23 Qd3} 23. Ne5+ Kd8 {unexpected.  to 23 ... dxe5 24 Rxh3 I had done some work.  to 24 ... e4 25 Qh6 was my intended reply.  24 ... exd4 a possibility is 25 Rad1.  Two pawns up I had expected to win but it might take a while.} 24. Rxh3 {Best.  24 Nc6+ does not win a piece as black can regain it after 24 ... Kd7 25 Rxh3 Qf5! This leads to a heavy piece ending where white is three pawns ahead and should win.} dxe5 25. dxe5 Qxe5 26. Qc2 {The point of this strong move is to prevent ... Qf5 and also poisons the "d" pawn} Ra6 {I had spent time analyzing 26 ... Rc8 27 Qxh7.   Now 27 ... Qg5 which apparently wins loses to 28 Qh4! 27 ... Rg7 is met by 28 Qh5 Qxb2 29 Qh4+ Kd7 30 Qa4+ Kd6 31 Qf4+ Kd7 32 Qf5+ Kc7 33 d6+ Kxd6 34 Rd1+ 1-0 and 31 ... Kc5 32 Qe3+ Kd6 33 Qa3+ Qxa3 34 Rxa3 Rc5 35 Rd1 Rg5  36 Rd3 1-0} 27. Rc1 Ra8 {losing at once.  to 27 ... Rag6 28 Qc8+ Ke7 29 Qxg8!! takes the play into an easy ending. 29 ... Qg5 30 Re3+! 1-0 } 28. d6 {black can not defend himself. a rook at least will be lost.} Qf6 29. Qc7+ Ke8 30. Qc6+ Kf8 31. Qxa8+ {}
