1. e4 {This is a game played in the 49th Tournament on Gameknot. A game that was both interesting and short!} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {The Petroff Defence. If beginner(s) are playing this can lead to discovered checks, queen losses and broken hearts...} 3. Nxe5 Qe7 {Aiming at 4.Nf3 Nxe4 and then ...Nc3disc.  winning the queen!} 4. d4 {An irritating setback} Nxe4 5. Be2 {My opponent sees my cunning plan :-(} d6 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. O-O Nc6 8. c3 Qf6 {I can see a kingside attack coming on...} 9. Bd3 Qg6 10. h3 {Handing me the pawn on a silver platter. An added bonus!} Bxh3 {I see no true escape for Black without losing his rook...} 11. Bxe4 Qxg2# {And he doesn't even go for that. An interesting study of attacking the castled king - this particular variety of queen-bishop attack is particularly common.}
