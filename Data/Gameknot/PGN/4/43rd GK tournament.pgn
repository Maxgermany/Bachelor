1. e4 {Destructive power of Kings gambit- DOUBLE BISHOP SACRIFICE- win on move 22. Learnt this most unpredictable of all gambits in April 2008, works on players of rating <1600 usually. Quiz- what wud u do on move 10 and 13?? See my 6 other annot games on KG- ALL EXCITING} e5 2. f4 {pawn offered} exf4 {taken. now the fun begins} 3. Nf3 d6 4. Bc4 {long term aim- destroy the f7 pawn and draw the king out, prevent castling} Bg4 5. O-O Nd7 6. d4 {eye his f4 pawn} g5 {he protects it, BUT NOW HIS KINGSIDE DEFENCE IS WEAKENING, all because he wants to keep this f4 pawn. I have to prevent him from castling now on queenside} 7. e5 {disrupt his q pawns, dominate the center} dxe5 8. dxe5 Bc5+ 9. Kh1 Bxf3 {what would you do here?   Think.   Then see what I did (just like my other annotated games vs maten and others)} 10. Bxf7+ {surprised? bishop sacrifice} Kxf7 11. Qxf3 Nxe5 {expected} 12. Qh5+ {from now kings gambit enters unpredictable territory. will try to keep checking him and win back some material. Note- I am 4 points down} Kg7 {What would you do AGAIN. Think} 13. Bxf4 {wham- second bishop sacrificed} Qe8 {if he took my bishop g x dsb, then my queen would have taken his knight on e5, and checked him while attacking his dsb. } 14. Qxg5+ {he is in big trouble now} Ng6 15. Qxc5 Nxf4 16. Qxc7+ {cant take with my rook for Qe1 can blunt my attack. double attack on his king and knight} Kg6 17. Qxf4 Qe6 18. Qg3+ Kh5 19. Rf4 Qe7 20. Rf5+ Kh6 21. Qf4+ Kg6 22. Qg4+ {Hope you enjoyed. Kings gambit leads to short exciting games, chess for adrenaline junkies. Pl comment and rate freely. Could he have saved his game after my first bishop sac??  Hope you enjoyed.}
