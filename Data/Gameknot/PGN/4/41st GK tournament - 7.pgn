1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor Defence } 3. d4 {white straightaway strikes at the center} exd4 {By this capture Black gives up his center} 4. Bc4 {Here I preferred to sac a p so as to play in gambit style but black doesnt co-operate} Be7 {If one wants to play without risk then this is o.k - Not committing & developing the piece around 3 ranks! (though this breaks the small rule - Ns before B) } 5. Nxd4 {Here I was considering 5.c3 but somewhat felt blacks 5...,Ne4 might give edge to him & so instead played the text} Bd7 {Now this is too much - Here Blacks violates again the basic principle & though at first sight it seems difficult to exploit the move neverthless Blacks text must be punished & whites attack starts rolling} 6. Qh5 {Threatens 7.Qxf7 # & black will find it difficult to find defence or one may say, as the game unfolds,  there is no defence against f7 # except to give up a piece. The point is which piece will black prefer to give his g8N or d7B.} g6 {This temporarily blocks the threat but white shifts his Q on d5} 7. Qd5 {setting Q-B battery on the diagonal a2-g8 & reinstating the the threat of # on f7 & creating another threat on b7-p.} Be6 {Black blocks the f7#; but white eliminates the B} 8. Nxe6 {& now black instead of taking the N he counters whites Q with } Nf6 {Now white has the choice between Nxd8 - taking the Q & after Black takes the Q, white recaptures the N on d5 with B when he remains a piece up to the good or he has N-g7  & followed by Qxf7, when he has a strong pressure against Blacks K, so he I choose the latter forcing Blacks K to d7} 9. Ng7+ {Ofcourse Black K cant go to f8 due to # from f7} Kd7 {the only flee} 10. Qxf7 {White prefers taking the f7-p rather than b7 as it mounts strong pressure on blacks K} Kc8 {Blacks K tries to find a safe home but white now strikes the  Q} 11. Ne6 Qd7 {White now has lot of good option viz.12.Qg7 attacking the R or 12.Nc5 followed by 13.Be6 trapping blacks Q or as played in the game, developing his N & defending the e4-p  } 12. Nc3 Nc6 {develops his last minor piece with the threat of fork from e5 on whites f7Q & B on c4. White has two good way to repluse the threat - 13.Bb5 pinning the N or as played in the game} 13. f4 {stops any of blacks idea of ....Ne5 & at the same time take more space in the center} Bf8 {Text is ?!. Probably Black wants to swap the Qs but this leaves his N hanging on f6. This shows how a player cracks under pressure. } 14. Qxf6 {picks the N & further  threatens the R. With 2 piece down & no hope of letting down the attack Black prudently resigns...  }
