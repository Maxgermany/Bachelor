1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 h6 {Black normally waits until around move 9 before playing this, but it probably doesn't make any difference.} 5. Bxf6 {Nothing wrong with this, but I would prefer Bh4, hoping to entice Black into playing ...g5 and weakening his kingside.} gxf6 {Interesting! The only reason Black would play this is to get an open file for an attack on White's king. But since he has no pieces developed, White needn't worry for a while!} 6. cxd5 {Good - further weakens Black's pawn structure.} exd5 7. Qb3 {I think developing the kingside is a higher priority. I'm also not convinced this is the best square for the queen.} c6 8. e4 {A little too bold! White should get his king to safety before opening the centre.} Qe7 {Developing a piece with a threat is always good.} 9. Bd3 {9.Qc2 was the only move.} Be6 {Black should take the pawn. If White recaptures, Black wins a piece by ...f5.} 10. Qc2 Nd7 11. Nge2 h5 12. O-O {The king was safe enough on e1. 12.exd5 cxd5 13.Nb5 wins at least a pawn.} Bh6 13. exd5 {Opening the e-file must be good for White.} cxd5 14. Rfe1 O-O {Probably better than leaving it on the open file.} 15. Ng3 f5 {There was no good move here.} 16. Nxf5 {16.Nxd5 and 16.Bxf5 are even stronger.} Qg5 17. Nxh6+ Qxh6 18. Bf5 Bxf5 19. Qxf5 Nf6 20. Nxd5 Nxd5 21. Qxd5 b6 22. Re5 Kg7 23. Rxh5 {}
