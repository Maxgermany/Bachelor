1. d4 d5 {So he copies me.} 2. c4 {Queen's Gambit} c6 {Slav variation.} 3. Nc3 {3. Nf3 is usually played first, to stop the Slav Gambit, 3......e7-e5, but in fact it has never been played against me, and the game transposes.} Nf6 {Natural development.} 4. Nf3 {White too follows the main line.} e6 {The Semi-Slav, which can be reached by other move orders.} 5. Bg5 {I play the common pin variation. 5....Nb-d7 is playable now followed by 6.....Qa5 - the Cambridge Springs variation.} dxc4 {This pawn capture is common in the Slav. } 6. e4 {Played after a long think.6. a4 is also playable.} b5 {He hangs on to the pawn on c4.} 7. e5 {I push again.} h6 {Forced, otherwise he loses knight for pawn.} 8. Bh4 {I retreat.} g5 {He hits the bishop again.} 9. Nxg5 {This is a temporary sacrifice of a knight.} hxg5 {He takes.} 10. Bxg5 {I take back.} Nbd7 {He does this so that he can recapture on f6.} 11. Qf3 {So I attack f6 again.} Qb6 {I found out afterwards that actually Bb7 instead of Qb6 is good for black. This is good for white now.} 12. Bxf6 {So I take.} Nxf6 {He takes back.} 13. Qxf6 {I take back, hitting the rook.} Rg8 {The natural square for the rook.} 14. O-O-O {Protecting my d pawn with my rook, and moving the king out of the center. I found out later that this position has been seen in this game. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14169707&mv=27&rnd=0.03949373448267579} Be7 {White has no choice now, as Qh6?? and Qf4?? both lose the queen to Bg5.} 15. Qf3 {So I run back here.} Bb7 {Threatening c6-c5} 16. Ne4 {In the aforementioned game white continued Qe2? instead of Ne4 with advantage to black. Ne4 is played to discourage c6-c5. In computer analysis afterwards, we found that black can still play c6-c5! and meet dxc5 with Qxc5! and if white takes the black queen, black can take the white queen. That is probably the best continuation for black.  } Rd8 {Played after a long think.} 17. Qe3 {Again, played to prevent the freeing c6-c5.} Qa5 {Black hits the pawn on a2.} 18. a3 {If instead I had played Kb1, then black has got c6-c5, as my d pawn can't take on c5 as he can play Rd8xRd1+. So this is the only way to protect it. I was planning on meeting b5-b4 with Nc5.} Rd7 {He starts wasting time, leading to a massive advantage for me. b5-b4 was better.} 19. Rg1 {So I finally prepare to develop my king side.} Kd8 {He decides to remove his king from the center.} 20. Be2 {I connect my rooks.} Kc8 {He continues his king march.} 21. f4 {I start advancing my pawns.} Rdd8 {He retreats, black is entirely passive now.} 22. g4 {The pawn march continues.} Rgh8 {He hits my h pawn.} 23. h3 {I protect it.} Rdg8 {Other rook comes over too.} 24. g5 {I want to play Qg3, but not allowing him to play a bishop or even a rook to h4} Qd8 {Queen comes back too} 25. Qg3 {I continue with my plan.} Kb8 {Another waiting move} 26. h4 {Onward Christian soldiers!} Qf8 {Even the queen comes over!} 27. h5 {On again!} Bc8 {Still waiting.} 28. Qc3 {With thoughts of switching to the queen side. Also an immediate h5-h6 drops the pawn to Rxh6 and I can't recapture without losing my queen, if it is still on g3.} Qd8 {So his queen comes back to prevent my queen from invading.} 29. h6 {And now I can advance.} Rgf8 {To protect f7} 30. a4 {With thoughts of opening up the queen side.} Bb7 {Bishop comes back.} 31. Nc5 {Knight hops in.} Bc8 {Bishop drops back} 32. Bf3 {I hit c6.} Qb6 {He protects} 33. Qe3 {My queen comes over.} a6 {He solidifies the queen-side.} 34. Qe4 {I hit c6 again.} Kc7 {He protects again. This is where I missed a quicker win. 35.	a5 Qxa5 36. Qxc6+  wins for example Kb8 37. Qa8+ Kc7 38.Qa7+ Kd8 39. d5. The higher boards in my team all saw this - which perhaps shows why they have a slight edge over me!} 35. Qe3 {I protect c5 again.} Rfd8 {Rook comes back} 36. Bh5 {Bishop hits pawn.} Rdf8 {Rook comes back.} 37. Kc2 {With dreams of opening up the queen-side, by putting my rooks on a1 and b1 and playing b2-b3, but it is not the best move.} Qa5 {Ok, stop and find white's next move!} 38. Bxf7 {Did you find it? I should have played it a move earlier, when it was even stronger.} Rxf7 {So he takes.} 39. g6 {Now these pawns can't be stopped.} Rf5 {Rook moves out of the way.} 40. g7 {I hit the rook.} Rd8 {His rook comes over.} 41. g8=Q {Good enough, but h6-h7 was even stronger, and would have caused my opponent to resign, he confided to me later.} Rxg8 {He takes.} 42. Rxg8 {I take back.} Bxc5 {He takes.} 43. dxc5 {I take back.} Qxa4+ {He checks.} 44. Kd2 {I want to find safety on the king-side.} Rh5 {He hits my pawn.} 45. Qd4 {He can't take it, as I have a mating attack, starting with Qd8+.} Rh2+ {He checks.} 46. Ke1 {King comes back.} Rh1+ {He checks again.} 47. Rg1 {Rook comes back.} Rxh6 {This is an error, but black is hopelessly lose anyway.} 48. Rg7+ {I check.} Kb8 {King drops back.} 49. Qd6+ {And my opponent realizes that he is about to get mated and resigns. Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the "star" system.}
