1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d3 e5 {Dubious. This simply drops a center p. (Dont know why this blindness occured)} 3. e4 {?! He should have x the e5-p. Now black is back in the game with} Nc6 {Given the opportunity, Black grabs it with both hands!} 4. a3 {By change of move order, the opening is transposed to Ponziani Opening.  Now, whites 4.a3?!, I feel is waste of time. Probably he is expecting 4...,Bc5; when 5.b4,Bb6 (though correct is ...,Bd6!?); 6.b5, N any move; 7.Nxe5 _ picks the center p    } d5 {Black strightaway goes for the center ...,d5 break, forcing } 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Nc3 {Offering to exchange the Ns; Black here has the option of trading the N & spoiling whites p structure but prefers the development move } Bc5 {Prepares for 0-0 thus activating his ksR} 7. d4 {Text is ?! White is bound to loose the p with no compensation, neverthless why did white offer this p. I cant make any sense, except, for the LSB outlet I cant find any explanation, anyway p is a p & black plays} exd4 8. Nxd4 {Blundering a piece for no cause! It leaves no option for black but to come down with} Bxd4 9. Nxd5 {with piece down, white is simply aiding black with this exchange also. } Qxd5 {After retaking, with N   P up, the game is in my pocket unless I do something stupid...,} 10. Qe2+ Be6 {blocks the check & prepares for either side castling} 11. c3 {Kicks off the B & here Black has 2 good option 11...,Bb6 keeping the B on the diagonal a7-g1 or as in the game} Bf6 {keeping an eye on whites c3-p & making it difficult for him to expand on the qs. Also this also keeps a defender on the ks in case black 0-0} 12. Be3 O-O {Activates his ks-R & connects both the Rs } 13. Rd1 Qb3 {This keeps pressure on b2-p} 14. Qb5 {White offers to trade the Qs } Qxb5 {With a piece up, who won't love to swap the Qs, so as to avoid any complications. Other option was 14...,Ra-d8!?; forcing 15.Rxd8 (15.Qxb3,Bxb3; 16.Rxd8 - & of course not 15.Be2? when 15...,Rxd1  & follows it up with 16...,Qxb5-  wins the Q)  } 15. Bxb5 Ne5 {N now moves up to find green pastures & there follows} 16. O-O a6 {Immediate 16....,Ra-d8!? but here I prefer to drive off the B before challenging the open d-file} 17. Be2 Rad8 {As planned which will be followed by ....,Bb3} 18. Rxd8 {Exchanges only helps black} Rxd8 {taking the control of d-file} 19. f4 {Here I was expecting 19.Rd1 so as to challenge the d-file, but white prefers to kick off the N & gain a tempo. Now Black can counter whites e3B via g4 or as in the game } Nc4 {hits the B on e3 & b2-p. White now has to decide whether to exchange the N or defend the p but either way it wont make difference} 20. Bc1 {This defence doesnt work as black still comes down with} Nxb2 {temporarily sacrifices his N for the p & shatters whites p-structure on q-side} 21. Bxb2 Rd2 {this fork will recover the piece } 22. f5 {White counters the B } Rxe2 {Black first captures the LSB & will follow it up with x of DSB, if white takes the e6B} 23. fxe6 Rxb2 {It is all over ...} 24. exf7+ {Nothing good to suggest. If 24.e7, then 24...,Bxe7; & 25.Re1 is met with 25...,Kf8- } Kxf7 25. h3 {White is still hoping & hanging, anyway} Rb3 {time for p hunting} 26. a4 Rxc3 {With piece up & passers rolling on the q-side, it is just a matter of time } 27. Rd1 Ke6 {effectively blocks the whites R-d7 penetration} 28. Kh2 b5 {starts rolling down the passers} 29. axb5 axb5 30. Re1+ Be5+ {blocks & counters whites K with his own  } 31. Kg1 Rc2 {Confines the white K to the 1st rank} 32. Rb1 {Still hanging, anyway} c6 {well, I missed the strong 32...,Bg3! casting the mating net & whites R is tied down to the defence of 1st rank. eg. if 33.Kf1?! (trying the luft) doesn't work due to 33...,Rf2 , forcing 34.Kg1 (34.Ke1? then white drops his R to 34...,Rb2  - ); 34...,Re2! -  & white is in bind. Text is also good but allows some fight} 33. Rb3 Kd5 {Now K comes to the aid of his passers} 34. g4 Rc3 {Another option was 34...,Kc4; but text simplifies. White is forced to trade the Rs else another p drops.} 35. Rxc3 Bxc3 {Now Black has no obstruction & his passers are rolling} 36. Kh2 b4 37. g5 b3 {Only 2 moves from Queening} 38. h4 b2 39. h5 b1=Q {with re-birth of the Q, Black now goes for the kill  } 40. h6 Qf1 {Casting the mating net. Threat is 41...,Be5 #} 41. hxg7 Be5# {Its all over. At last won the 41st GK Tmt (though was declared the winner with a round to spare) with straight score 6.   Feels good as in my previous GKtournment I missed being the winner & was ousted due to clock (completely forgot to play)  }
