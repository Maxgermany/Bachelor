1. e4 {Hello everyone, and today I will annotate a game I finished recently.    White starts with e4} e5 {I choose the open games. } 2. Nf3 Nf6 {the petrov's defence. Most opponents played Nxe5, and after d6, they could play 4.Nf3 or 4.Nxf7!? After 4.Nf3 Nxe4, the most common move is Nc3. The move I hated to see was the very dull 5.d4.} 3. Nc3 {Petrov 3 knights. 3...Bb4 is supposed to be really OK for black. I choose the 4 knights game.} Nc6 4. Bc4 {A perfectly reasonable move, but I don't like it because black can play 4...Nxe4 with equality.} Nxe4 5. Nxe4 {the intermezzo Bxf7ch?! is inferior because I get a strong center, and my king can artificially castle.} d5 {the point} 6. Bxd5 {the best continuation is Bd3, keeping the 2 bishops.} Qxd5 7. d3 Bg4 {my pieces are rather active. } 8. h3 {another move in the DB was 8.Bh6, but this lacks a direct threat, and after something simple, like long castling, the bishop will have to go again.} Bh5 9. Qe2 {I really don't like this move. Black can get instant edge with Nd4} Nd4 {now white's position is totally inferior no matter what he plays. } 10. c4 {a counter attack.} Qa5+ {according to my instant analysis, white's best try will give him a much inferior endgame.} 11. Qd2 {a mistake. Loss of material is inevitable.} Bb4 12. Nc3 {now I pick up a piece easily. Hopefully you can spot in a few seconds at most.} Bxf3 {the bishop is immune, and white is still in great difficulty.} 13. O-O {Now I see a simple way to win.} Ne2+ 14. Kh2 Nxc3 {both captures lose.} 15. bxc3 {it doesn't matter anymore, white's position is completely destroyed.} Bxc3 16. Qe3 Bxa1 17. Qxf3 {The smoke has all cleared, and I am up a rook and a pawn.} O-O-O 18. Be3 Bd4 {trading the bishops are fine.} 19. Bc1 {horrid, but it really doesn't matter.} f6 {securing the chain.} 20. Qg4+ Rd7 {I plan to double rooks, win more material, trade, and win.h} 21. f4 Rhd8 {now the king goes to b1, and my pieces are all better, I am also a rook up.} 22. Rd1 Qxa2 23. Bd2 {I'll give the rest without comments..} Kb8 24. h4 Qc2 25. Bb4 exf4 26. Kh3 Be5 27. Qf3 Rd7xd3 {}
