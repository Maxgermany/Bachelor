[Opening "QGD (D32), Tarrasch, von Hennig-Schara gambit"]

1. d4 {So I start conventionally } d5 {He replies in kind.} 2. c4 {The Queen's Gambit} e6 {Declined} 3. Nc3 {I continue conventionally.} c5 {This is an interesting move, it can lead to the Tarrasch Defence.} 4. cxd5 {So I take.} cxd4 {This is the von Hennig-Schara gambit} 5. Qxd4 {I take} Nc6 {His knight comes out.} 6. Qd1 {Queen goes back. White is a pawn up, but black as better development.} exd5 {He takes back} 7. Qxd5 {I take.} Be6 {He hits my queen.} 8. Qxd8+ {So I take.} Rxd8 {He takes back.} 9. e3 {This is the most common move - stopping his knight from coming in on d4.} Nb4 {With nasty threats of N checking on c2 or maybe d3.} 10. Bb5+ {This is virtually forced.} Ke7 {As is this move. I now had a long think. I considered Ba4, Kf1 and Ke2. What I played accidentally  gave back the pawn. After the game my opponent said that this is the best idea, but I am not convinced. Other moves seem OK looking at the opening databases. What I played leads to a pretty equal position, and maybe white should go after more.} 11. Rb1 {Now if he takes the a pawn immediately, I can get his a pawn, by Ra1, but he has a little intermezzo which gains his pawn back.} a6 {This move. Now he can recapture the pawn on a2 with impunity.} 12. Be2 {So the bishop drops back.} Nxa2 {And the pawn goes.} 13. Nxa2 {His knight goes.} Bxa2 {My knight goes.} 14. Ra1 {I hit his bishop.} Bd5 {He retreats, hititng g2} 15. Nf3 {So I block.} Nf6 {His knight comes out.} 16. O-O {I castle.} Ne4 {Knight comes in - and he already offers a draw, which I turned down.} 17. Nd4 {I want to boot that knight on e4 with f2-f3 and maybe then e3-e4.} f6 {I don't understand this move of his.} 18. f3 {So I hit the knight.} Nd6 {He retreats.} 19. b3 {I want to keep pieces on the board. An immediate e3-e4 is met with Bc4, so I prevent that first.} Kf7 {Maybe this is the point of f7-f6 - so give his king a square} 20. e4 {But now the advance comes in.} Be6 {Forced!} 21. Bb2 {I have a plan. I want to play Be2-d3, to prevent his rooks coming in on the c file. Then I will advance in the centre, f3-f4 and e4-e5. This is potentially very dangerous for him.} Be7 {He finally connects his rooks.} 22. Bd3 {And I continue with my plan.} Nb5 {I hadn't expected this move!} 23. Bxb5 {So i take. I think the best move here for him is Be7-c5. } axb5 {But he just took back.} 24. Nxe6 {I take his bishop. I thought I may have chances here, thanks to his doubled b pawns.} Kxe6 {He takes back. } 25. Rfd1 {I contest the d file.} Bc5+ {He throws in a check.} 26. Kf1 {King comes to the centre, as it should in endgames. } Rxd1+ {He exchanges.} 27. Rxd1 {I take back.} Ra8 {He grabs the open file.} 28. Ra1 {I contest it.} Ra6 {This is an excellent move. If ever I exchange rooks, he un-doubles his pawns. Then his queen side pawn majority would be dangerous. } 29. Ke2 {So I bring my king up.} Bd6 {He hits my h pawn.} 30. g3 {I defend it, and prepare a king side advance.} Be5 {And draw agreed. OK tell me your thoughts on the final position. Who is better and why? Many thanks for reading my annotation, please leave a comment or two. Please rate it on the star system. Until next time dear reader!}
