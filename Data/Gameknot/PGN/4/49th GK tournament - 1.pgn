1. d4 {This is from a tournament game. My first tournament in the advanced class. I decided to annotate this game for posterity as it took my rating over 1600 for the first time ever. There are a number of mistakes on both sides but in the end it was pretty close} e6 {D4 is my preferred opening as white. I suspect I may have to change that if my rating continues to rise. Up to know it has served me well partly I suspect as some of my opponents don't know it as well as other openings} 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Tries to pressure me into either a3 or Bd2} 4. Nf3 {I ignore the pressure and continue to develop  as I normally do. In the past Bxc3,bxc3 has often proved to my advantage despite the weaker pawn structure as the doubled pawns have given me more influence over the centre} O-O 5. Qc2 {Looking at h7 but also allows me to prevent my pawns being doubled if he takes my knight. I normally move e3 too which defends both my c and d pawns} d5 {Trying to seize the initiative and attacking my undefended c pawn} 6. a3 {Attack is the best form of defence they say though I am still not sure if c5 would have been better here. I was reluctant to take his d pawn as it would give a half open e file to my still uncastled king} Bxc3+ {I'm not sure this was wise as black loses his best developed peice, though it does prevent a loss of tempo} 7. Qxc3 Ne4 {A strong outpost for the knight which is difficult to shift} 8. Qc2 {Loses a tempo, however this seems the best place for my queen, putting it on d3 will restrict my lsb, similarly Qb3 will block my b pawn} Nd7 {Blocks in the lsb completely and slightly restricts the queen. Is this a sign of a forthcoming pawn storm on the queens side?} 9. Bf4 {Allows me to finally move e3 and may restrict his a rook a little if the pawn storm materialises} c6 {This seems a very passive move to me though it gives the queen a little more room to move, I think I would have been tempted by c5} 10. e3 Qa5+ {I'm not clear why he did this, presumably an attempt to get me to move my king with something like 11: Nd2, Nxd2  12: Qxd2, Qxd2  13:Kxd2} 11. b4 {This is exactly why Qc2 was probably the best move at move 8} Qd8 {Pretty much the only option, so black has lost tempo and still can't develop his lsb} 12. Bd3 {As well as pressuring his knight I can now (finally) castle} Ndf6 {Black seems a little cramped now. it's still going to take him a couple of moves to complete his development} 13. O-O {That completes my development and links my rooks. I have a nice line of pawns on b,c and d, ready to push forward, a reasonable diagonal for my dsb - h2-b1 and my queen and lsb are aiming straight at h7. My knight has a number of options, such as e5 and g5. at e5 it would be difficult to move and would cramp black further, though it would block my dsb's diagonal} Bd7 14. a4 {The predicted pawn storm isn't forthcoming so I threaten one of my own} Rc8 {Eyeing up my queen which means I need to be careful in any pawn exchanges} 15. Bg5 {Pressuring the e knight One option here is Bxe4, dxe4, Qxe4, Nxe4, Bxd8, R(either) xd8 which gains a pawn and I think gives white a slight lead} a6 16. Bxf6 {This way is similar but preserves more attacking power.  Is it a mistake to swap a reasonably well placed dsb for a knight here? I was looking to break up the linked knight hence weakening blacks defence. As my dsb wasn't that active in threatening his king directly this seemed a reasonable exchange to me} Nxf6 {Almost forced, if he took with his queen then I could push my pawns forward on the queens side and he would take at least a move to get his queen back to defend} 17. Rfd1 {If in doubt move a piece to a better square, though I think now that c1 would probably have been better} h6 {Prevents Ng5, though Ne5 is still tempting} 18. b5 {This is probably my first ever serious (conscious) attempt at a pawn storm. Although I wasn't fully clear that it would work as I hoped, I was expecting the a file to open for my rook} cxb5 19. axb5 axb5 {Is this a mistake? Would Bxb5 be better? I now have a very nice open file for my a rook as I hoped} 20. c5 {Doubled pawns aren't always weak, in this case he has enough support} b6 21. Rac1 {I think this is a mistake, I think Rdc1 is better (or would have been on move 17)} bxc5 22. dxc5 {I now have a passed pawn, although the way for it to achieve its ambition isn't clear it poses a threat to black} Qc7 23. Ne5 {This is a complete blunder, I was concentrating too much on the black lsb} Qxe5 {At this point I was considering resigning, however I decided to continue a short while to see how the game looked} 24. Qb3 {Stops the black b pawn pushing too far forward. It can easily be defended where it is} Qb8 {Relieves the pressure on my c pawn} 25. Qb4 {Considering c6 and the possibilities that opens.} Bc6 {where is my knight when I need it!} 26. Rcb1 Ng4 {Another complete blunder by black even's up the game again in terms of material. I am in with a chance once again.} 27. Qxg4 f5 {Blocks the b1h7 diagonal for my lsb, which could have caused some problems for black} 28. Qe2 Qa7 {Concedes the b pawn} 29. Rdc1 {but the price is too high for me, I want to keep my passed pawn. It;s just a pity I didn't put this rook there on move 17} Rcb8 30. Bxb5 {Now I can try to free the path for my c pawn} Rfc8 31. Bxc6 Rxb1 {removes the last defender from my c pawn} 32. Rxb1 Rxc6 {I still can't put enough defence on my b pawn so I have to look for something else } 33. Qh5 {Looking at e8} Rxc5 {I would say this is a big mistake. Surely Qxc5 is better.} 34. Qe8+ Kh7 35. Qxe6 {regains the material} Qa2 {This is a fatal mistake by black} 36. Qxf5+ {Black resigned as mate is unavoidable.  Thanks for reading}
