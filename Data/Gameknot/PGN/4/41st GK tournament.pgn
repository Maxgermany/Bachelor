1. e4 {Continuing the oddly popular series entitled "Pikket Loses Games of Chess to Stronger Opponents" here is my other game against lq26.  Despite playing white I never even made it to the ending in this one...} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {The Petroff (which, as everyone knows, is great if Black just wants to, er, win).} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Bd6 7. O-O O-O 8. c4 {Aiming to undermine the support for Black's central knight.} c6 9. Re1 {Threatening to win a pawn with the exchange on e4, so:} Re8 10. Nc3 {Threatening to win a pawn with the exchange on e4, so:  (No, you're not going mad - I did just repeat my own annotation for two different moves.  It's called unpoetic license).} Nxc3 {Black blinks first.} 11. bxc3 Rxe1+ 12. Qxe1 {A difficult position to assess.  White has a small edge in the form of control of the e-file and half-open b-file.  Black's compensation is his lack of structural weaknesses and a target in White's weakened central pawns.} h6 {Black wants to stop pieces entering his position at e7, so he first prevents Bg5.} 13. Rb1 {Seizing the half-open file.} b6 {Calmly limiting the White's rook's line of attack.  This move does, however, invite White's next -- taking advantage of the new target on b6:} 14. a4 Be6 {Threatening to win a pawn with the exchange on c4, so:  (Gosh, this writing lark's a doddle - I only had to change one letter for that comment :o)} 15. Qe2 {White defends, also strengthening firepower on the light squares after a later cxd5.} Nd7 {Black continues calmly to develop his pieces on their optimum squares (obviously placing the knight on its other square, a6, would be disastrous - in view of cxd5, winning a piece)} 16. Be3 {Bd2 could have been considered as an alternative; keeping the Queen's line of sight down the e-file.} Qf6 {With this, Black is gearing up to pin the knight on f3 with ...Bg4 and further wreck White's pawns.} 17. cxd5 cxd5 18. a5 {(?!) White has tidied up his central pawns and now needs to find an active plan.  I decided upon this move, aiming to exchange off my isolated a-pawn and create a pawn weakness in Black's queenside.  Given how the game continued 18.c4 (or a preparatory 18. Nd2 first) would have been more circumspect.} Rc8 {Ganging up on the backward c-pawn.} 19. axb6 {White has time to swap off his weak a-pawn since ...Rxc3 20. bxa7 is obviously too dangerous for Black.} Nxb6 {The correct recapture.  The knight is heading for c4 where White will probably have to exchange his LSB for it.  The isolated (but passed) a-pawn represents either a strength or weakness for Black, depending on how you look at it.  Black is slightly better now.} 20. Qc2 {Wanting to avoid the knight pin after ...Bg4 but better was probably: 20. Ra1 ..Bg4 21. Rxa7 .. Bxf3 22. Qxf3 .. Qxf3 23. gxf3 ..Rxc3 when White should probably hold the draw.} Nc4 21. Bxc4 {As foretold.} Rxc4 22. Ra1 Bg4 {Offering his a-pawn in exchange for attacking chances again White's King.  I would not have accepted the pawn except I had found an attractive attacking idea for White, based on a Rook check on the back rank and the queen's attack on h7.} 23. Rxa7 {(!?) (With a deep breath)} Bxf3 24. Ra8+ {White interposes this check to force the DSB back to f8.  My idea was to offset Black's chances on the king side with my threat to win the pinned Bf8 with Qa3 or Qb8  in a couple of moves' time.} Bf8 {(Forced)} 25. gxf3 Qxf3 {I had thought this was a mistake, considering that there was no way for Black to meet White's threat of winning the pinned Bishop - other than by going in for the perpetual check after the White queen moves (with ...Qd1  and ...Qg4 ), something I was perfectly content with given my positional difficulties.} 26. Qb2 {(??) A crucial mistake.  Because I had missed Black's 26th move I did not consider the importance of keeping my queen covering the d1 square.  I thought it was enough to be threatening either ...Qb8 or ...Qa3 next move.  Qb3 would have allowed both of these moves but also kept an eye on d1 (and thereby prevented Black's winning counter-attack).} Rc6 {(!) Ouch! Black is going to checkmate White long before he can capture the Bishop on f8 (the threat is, on say 27. Qa3, just ...Rg6  28. Bg5 ...Rxg5 29. Kf1 and ...Qd1  ).  Now it can be seen that if White's queen was on b3 this combination would not be possible.  27. Qb8 is a little better, allowing the Queen to backtrack to g3 to block the rook's check from g6 but the loss of his queen would still be fatal in the long run.  The best bet would have been just to accept the earlier mistake and play 27.Qb3 now.  However without an attack on Black's king, White is just a lot worse.  Nothing is given by the sacrifice: 27. Rxf8  after ...Kf8  28.Qb8  ..Ke7 29. Qb7 .. Kd6, there is no perpetual.  Going from bad to worse, I conceived of a plan involving the sacrifice of my Bishop to block the g-file:} 27. h4 {Intending to meet ...Rg6  with 28. Bg5 and hoping for 28...hxg5  29. h5 ... (rook moves) and then 30. Qb8, winning the f8 bishop at last, with some drawing chances.} Rg6+ 28. Bg5 hxg5 29. h5 {So far so good... Now, if I can juuuuust get Qb8 in...} Re6 {Aah. (That would be the "...rook moves..." bit of my analysis...  I was expecting ...Rh6).  Now, of course, 30 Qb8 is met with ...Re1  and mate next move with ...Rh1   .  So, faced with huge loss of material after something like 30. Qa1 ...Re2  31. Qf1 ..Re4 (threat Rg4 ) 32. Qg2 ..Re1  33. Kh2 .. Qxh5  34.Qh3 .. Rh1! (netting the queen), White resigns.  A game that shows how much the little things count - the difference between 26 Qb2 and 26. Qb3 is only one square but probably cost the whole point.  Hope you enjoyed the notes, oao - Pikket}
