1. e4 {This game was from the 41st Gk tournament. I was already through, but if my opponent beat me then he would qualify also. In this game my opponent did'nt blunder but made some weak moves and was outplayed} c5 2. Nf3 d6 {The dragon is an opening i'm trying to learn so as to play it in competative play} 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nf6 6. Bc4 g6 7. O-O {The first move that suggests that my opponent doesn't want to play a main line dragon} Bg7 8. Nxc6 bxc6 {An interesting position. White has better development but black has a solid position} 9. h3 {weak, as if 9. Be3 had been played then f3 was fine. Anyway, the bishop is better on b7} O-O 10. Re1 Qc7 {e5 is a real threat, as it will rip apart my pawn structure} 11. Bf4 e5 {e5 must not be allowed. Although it seems unnatural to block in the bishop in, e5 is best and there aren't any tactics on c3} 12. Bg5 Nd7 {Ugly. Be7 would of won a pawn} 13. Qd2 {luckily he didn't spot it} Nb6 14. Bb3 {over the next few moves my opponents starts a speculative attack on the king side which doesn't get him anywhere except into trouble} Re8 15. Bh6 Bh8 16. Re3 Be6 {It is necessary to swap of the bishops. Sicilian players take note: it is very easy to fall foul of combinations reliant on the pinned f7 pawn.} 17. Rf3 {consenting to the doubling of the pawns. This is not wise, as it gives black an advantage in the ending} Bxb3 18. cxb3 {This was the wrong way to take, as I now have a very strong central pawn roller} Rad8 19. Qg5 d5 {Time to get the ball rolling while my opponent fruitlessly tries to attack on the kingside} 20. exd5 cxd5 21. Rc1 {One move cheapo's very rarely work} Qd7 22. a4 {Bad, as the knight isn't doing a lot on b6, White has effectively lost a tempo} e4 23. Rf6 {ugly, as it allows me to swap of queens.} Qe7 24. Rf5 Qxg5 25. Rxg5 f5 {White's rook and bishop are so bad they are effectively useless  } 26. Re1 Be5 {This move deserves an exclamation mark. White might as well play without his rook on g5 and his bishop on h6} 27. Ne2 d4 {the pawns are coming and they ain't gonna stop} 28. f4 Bf6 29. Rd1 d3 {Taking the rook is bad as the rook is pretty useless. As well as this the pawns are strong with the rooks behind them.} 30. Kf1 dxe2+ 31. Kxe2 Rxd1 32. Kxd1 Bxg5 33. Bxg5 {After the chaos is over I am a rook for a pawn up. My opponent should resign. The rest is trivial.} Nd5 34. Ke2 Nb4 35. Bf6 Nd3 36. Ke3 Kf7 37. Bd4 a6 38. h4 Rb8 39. Bc3 Rxb3 {another pawn is won.} 40. g3 Nxb2 {and another.} 41. Kd4 Nxa4 {and another.} 42. Be1 Ke6 43. Kc4 Rb5 44. Kd4 Nc5 45. Kc4 Nd3 {If this was a real game and i was short of time, I would swap the rook for the bishop to make it easier.} 46. Bd2 Kd6 47. Be3 Rb4+ 48. Kc3 Kd5 49. Kc2 Kc4 50. Kd2 Rb2+ 51. Kd1 a5 {White is forced backwards into a mating net.} 52. Bd2 a4 53. Ke2 a3 54. h5 a2 55. hxg6 a1=Q 56. gxh7 {white misses the mate. If he was being annoying, the longest way to mate was 56. Ke3 Qg1  57. Ke2 Qe1#} Qe1# {mate}
