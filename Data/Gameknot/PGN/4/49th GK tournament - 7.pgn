1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 Bf5 4. Bd3 Bg6 5. Nbd2 e6 6. O-O Nc6 7. Re1 Bd6 8. Bxg6 {maybe a simple e4 would be better, but those bishop made me angry.} hxg6 9. e4 dxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 11. Rxe4 {white seems to be better, because he has the pieces in the center, but the bishop on d6 and the rook on h8 targets the h2 pawn. So white fought for the center, while made some attack on his own king with the open of the h-file.} Ne7 12. Bg5 Qd7 13. Ne5 Qb5 {I had a "loosing-pawn" feeling.} 14. Bxe7 Bxe7 15. Rb1 Qd5 16. Qf3 Bf6 17. c4 {white seems to be better again, but black has no weak points. I get tempos, but have no pieces to push into the fight.} Qd6 18. Rd1 Rd8 19. g3 {i felt the h2-pawn weak still.} Bxe5 20. Rxe5 c6 21. Qe4 Kf8 22. Qf3 Rd7 23. Re2 Rh5 24. Red2 Rf5 25. Qe3 Qe7 26. a3 {try to defend the territory... I found no plan. So I try to prevent any attack from black and get a draw.} Qf6 27. Qb3 Rf3 28. Qb4+ Kg8 29. Qc5 a6 30. Qe5 Rxf2 31. Qb8+ Rd8 32. Qxb7 Rxd2 33. Rxd2 Rxd4 34. Rf2 Rd1+ 35. Kg2 Qd4 36. Qxc6 Rb1 37. Qf3 f6 38. Qe2 e5 39. Qc2 Re1 40. Qxg6 Qd8 41. Qg4 Qb6 42. Qc8+ {maybe I can push in the c-pawn, but I scared a little, so I made a perpetual check.}
