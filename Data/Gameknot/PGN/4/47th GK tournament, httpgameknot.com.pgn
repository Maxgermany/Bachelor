1. e4 {Maybe the best move in the opening.I am not sure. However the most played one.And the Philidor Defence that i couldnt understand its purpose start.} e5 {A symetrical answer to share center fairly.} 2. Nf3 {Develops the knight and attacks the pawn.} d6 {Saves the pawn but no development. I think Nc6 is better.(Nf6 is good,too)} 3. Bc4 {Develops the bishop and controls the diogonal.} f5 {f5?! He thinks i will capture the pawn and have a free space for bishop but i won't.} 4. d3 {Saves e5 pawn and lets queen's bishop a free diogonal.} fxe4 {Captures my center pawn.} 5. dxe4 {Exchange pawns.} Bg4 {Pins my knight so i cannot play it.And the bishop comes to a good square.} 6. Nc3 {Now, a small trap -that remember how piece development is important at the opening- starts.} h6 {Not a good move.He tries not to let me attack his queen by Bg5 but he loses tempo and forgets development.} 7. Nxe5 {Capture Queen or knight? Which one seems logical?} Bxd1 {Yeah.He couldnt see the danger and captured my queen.} 8. Bf7+ {King has only one square to go.} Ke7 {He plays his last move.} 9. Nd5# {A nice mate with coordination of knights and bishop.}
