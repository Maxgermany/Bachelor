1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {White initiates the Ruy-Lopez} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 {All pretty standard Ruy-Lopez stuff} O-O {8...,d6!? but here black changes the move order (idea was to keep the Marshall Attack in hand if given opportunity)  } 8. c3 {White presents the opportunity but somehow I decided to change & played the standard stuff. (Actually a bad sign of double mind which should be avoided)  } d6 {Black now threatens to pin the f3N } 9. d4 {Text is playable } Bg4 {Since white allows the pin Black grabs the opportunity.} 10. Nbd2 {This is ?! Here pretty stuff was either 10.d5 or 10.Be3; Whites text now allows black to win the center d4-p} exd4 11. h3 {Too late! Now Whites tries to minimize the loss. Here 11.cxd4, is met with 11...,Nxd4 with strong bind. Anyway black continues with} dxc3 {Much better, than either of 11...,Bh5 retreats spoils the position for black as after 12.g4, white will recover the p or 11...,Bxf3 - the exchange removes the pressure & here also though white loses a p but at a small cost.} 12. bxc3 {White avoides taking the B as after 12.hxg4,cxd2; 13.Nxd2, whites has a bad position of p structure & his k is slightly exposed. } Bh5 {Still maintains the pin & now black plans 13...,Ne5} 13. Qc2 {Unpins the N but black still comes down with} Ne5 {Threatens to trade minor pieces on f3 & shatter whites caslted position, so white is forced (practically) to play} 14. Nxe5 dxe5 15. Nf1 {eying for either d5 or f5 square from e3 or g3 hop} c5 {Ignores whites N jump, now there is danger of whites B getting trapped, so white plays } 16. c4 {blocks the ...,c4 advance. Text threatens 17.cxb4 & 18.Qxc5= & also opens the outlet for his DSB which might turn on the long diagonal attacking blacks central e5-p, so black plays} Qc7 {Defends above threats } 17. cxb5 {Here I feel this is ?! as it allows black a neat passer on qs } axb5 18. a3 {else B gets trapped, but better was 18.Qc3 so as to play 19.Bb2 } c4 {This now shuts whites LSB though he might transfer it on the diagonal b1-h7 via a2. } 19. Ba2 {This now drops whites a3-p. Here whites B retreat is premature as Black couldn't take the B due to the pin. Still 19.Qc3!?  } Bxa3 {other good option for me was 19...,Bg6 & here if 20.Ng3 then 20...,Bxa3- . Now whatever way white plays Black has a excellent game! eg:20.Bxa3,Rxa3- ; 2p  & clear passers rolling  on q-side  or 20.Bxc4(intermezzo) is refuted with 20...,Bb4!; 21.Rxa8,Rxa8; 22.Bd2,Bxd2; 23.Nxd2,Qxc4-  wins a piece   } 20. Bb2 {White avoids any tactical skirmishes, offering black to trade the DSBs. Here  Black has lot of good choices 20....,Bxb2 trading the B & simplyifying or 20...,Bc5 aiming at f2-p or as played in the game} Bg6 {Black now targets white central e4-p which will soon be followed by ....,Bc5} 21. Ng3 {Overprotects his e4-p; Black now plays as planned  } Bc5 {Gets the B away from the a-file, & aims the f2-p. This also ties down 2 pieces on the a-file } 22. Bc1 Nd5 {N advances with impunity eying the d3 square outpost via b4. White is unable to capture the N due to the pin. Now  White decides better to resign rather than prolong the torture}
