1. e4 {This was an over-the-board game in the 4NCL} c5 {I reply with my normal} 2. Nf3 {Normal so far} Nc6 {And the same from me, although d6 is slightly more common} 3. Bb5 {He attacks my knight} e6 {I prepare to move my other knight to e7 to protect it} 4. O-O {He castles} Nge7 {I carry on with my plan.} 5. b3 {He prepares to put his bishop on b2} d6 {a6 immediately is more consistent} 6. Bb2 {He carries on with his plan} a6 {Hitting the Bishop. I was afraid if I didn't do this, he would play Rf1-e1 and then drop the bishop back to f1} 7. Be2 {So he drops back here} h6 {I played this, so that I could, in some variations play e7-e5 and follow it with Bc8-e6, without having to worry about Nf3-g5 hitting my Bishop on e6. OK see if you can guess his next move - and generally see if you can guess his moves from now on. See if you can play as well as him!} 8. d4 {Black's last move was too slow, so he sets about opening up the position.} Qc7 {I didn't like the idea of opening up the position, while he is so much better developed than me.} 9. d5 {Did you get that? He seizes a space advantage.} Nd8 {I drop back, perhaps able to come to e6 if he exchanges} 10. Nc3 {Did you get that? He develops for now.} e5 {I close the position.} 11. Nxe5 {This is a lovely little maneuver, opening up the position with advantage. He temporarily sacs a Knight for pawn. } dxe5 {So I take} 12. d6 {He advances} Qc6 {Best square for the queen} 13. dxe7 {He takes} Bxe7 {I take back} 14. Nd5 {As well as hitting the Bishop, he is also now threatening Bb2xe5} Bd6 {So I meet both threats} 15. f4 {I hadn't seen this. Now f3 allows Bh5 check, with a tremendous attack for white. I decide to sac a pawn.} Be6 16. fxe5 {So he takes.} Bb8 {I retreat, hoping at some stage to recapture the pawn on e5} 17. Bg4 {I didn't expect this move either!} b5 {With thoughts of Ra8-a7, defending along the 7th rank, and/or Qc6-b7 and Nc6 hitting e5.} 18. Qf3 {He starts to mobilize his last pieces - his queen and rook } Ra7 {I want to castle (0-0) but first I have to defend my e7 square, otherwise he can play Nd5-e7 forking king and queen} 19. Rad1 {He mobilizes!} O-O {I castle} 20. Bf5 {Moving his Bishop up into an attacking square. I hope you are still trying to guess his moves. How many have you got right?} Qe8 {With ideas of exchanging on either d5 or f5 and taking on e5 if he recaptures with a pawn.} 21. Nf6+ {Did you get that one? A KNight sacrifice to open up my king side.} gxf6 {So I take} 22. exf6 {He takes back, threatening Qg4 check followed by Qg7 mate.} Bxf5 {So I take the Bishop} 23. exf5 {He takes back, still threatening Q4 check followed by mate on g7} Kh7 {So I prepare Rg8 if necessary} 24. Qh3 {This is an excellent move, by far the best move he could have chosen. If he had played his queen to h5 I can save myself by Qe6 check followed by Qg5. He wants to play Bc1 and take on h6. If he plays Bc1 first, then I can play Qc6 and then take on f6. There is no defense now. Probably best is Qc6, hitting f6, he plays Qh4, then I can play Rg8, threatening mate on g2. He meets it with say g3. Now the only way for me to avoid the disastrous lost of the h6 pawn is Rg5, meeting Bc1 with Qxf6, he exchanges on g5 and I end up the exchange (rook for bishop) and pawn down in a hopeless ending. I decide instead to give a knight back, hoping against hope that he will go wrong in the complications. } Ne6 25. Bc1 {Obviously!} Nf4 {I block} 26. Rxf4 {He takes} Qe2 {I hit his rook on d1, with my own checks} 27. Qxh6+ {Did you find that queen sacrifice to finish me off? Now of course, Kg8 is met by Qg7 mate and Kxh6 is met by Rh4 checkmate. So I resigned! Many thanks for reading this, I hope you enjoyed it. Please leave me a comment or two, and rate it with the star system.}
