1. d4 {I was a few minutes late for the start.} Nf6 {I play my usual.} 2. Nf3 {I paused here and eventually played.} g6 {This} 3. c4 {White gradually steers the game into a mainline Grünfeld Defence.} Bg7 {I continue to develop.} 4. Nc3 {White threatens e2-e4.} d5 {So I switch it to a Grünfeld Defence.} 5. cxd5 {And he opts for the exchange variation. I was rather expecting 5. Qb3 Russian System as white has already played Nf3. It is generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. } Nxd5 {I take back.} 6. e4 {He seizes the centre.} Nxc3 {I exchange.} 7. bxc3 {He takes back.} O-O {I castle.} 8. Bc4 {This is rather unusual with Nf3.  In the late 1970s Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, with Nf3, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside. Another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3, Qd2, and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White's centre, remove White's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by White.} c5 {I hit the centre.} 9. h3 {He prevents the pin by ....Bg4, but at the cost of losing a valuable tempo.} Nc6 {I hit d4 again. I'm now attacking it 4 times, with pawn, knight, bishop and queen. He is only protecting it 3 times.} 10. Be3 {So he protects d4 again.} cxd4 {I take.} 11. cxd4 {He takes back.} Qa5+ {I throw in a check.} 12. Qd2 {He interposes his queen.} Qxd2+ {I take.} 13. Kxd2 {He has to take back with the king, as taking with knight or bishop loses his d pawn.} Rd8 {I attack the d pawn again. If Kd3 then I can win a pawn by taking on d4 followed by e7-e5, so he only has one move.} 14. Kc3 {This has all been seen before, Na5	was played in Seitler, Andrej (2064) vs. Stefan, Oldrich (2067) Bd7 was played in Colomer Guart, … (2205) vs. Brunet Martinez… (2235) b6 was played in Asfora, Marco A… (2271) vs. Toth, Christian… (2344). All games were won by Black. } Na5 {I attack the bishop. } 15. Bb3 {15.	Be2	was played in Seitler, Andrej (2064) vs. Stefan, Oldrich (2067)} Nxb3 {I thought that his bishop was better than my knight.} 16. axb3 {This is the best way to recapture, opening up the a file for him, and protecting the c4 square. I now had a long think.} f5 {I like this move. If he protects the pawn with 17. Nd2 or 17. Ng5 then f4 wins for me. If 17. Kd3 then e7-e5 is strong. If he takes, my bishop takes back with gain of time. That leaves only one move for him.} 17. e5 {This.} Be6 {But now his d pawn is backward.} 18. Rhc1 {He finally develops his Rh1.} a6 {I get ready to move my Ra8.} 19. Kb2 {He threatens to invade on c7.} Rac8 {So I contest control of the c file.} 20. Rxc8 {He takes.} Rxc8 {I take back.} 21. Rc1 {He contests the c file.} Rxc1 {I take.} 22. Bxc1 {He takes back.} Bd5 {I think this ending is very comfortable for me. His d pawn is backward. I have a queen-side pawn majority.} 23. Ne1 {He has a plan to unravel his king-side. } e6 {I make it harder for him to enforce d4-d5} 24. f3 {This frees the knight from protecting his king-side pawns.} Kf7 {And this frees my bishop from protecting the e6 pawn.} 25. Nd3 {He threatens Nc5.} b6 {Which I prevent.} 26. Kc3 {He brings his king up.} Bf8 {I move my bishop to a more useful square.} 27. Bg5 {Threatening Bd8 and an attack on b6.} Be7 {So I stop that.} 28. Bxe7 {He takes.} Kxe7 {I take back.} 29. Nb4 {He attacks d5 and a6.} Bb7 {So this is forced.} 30. Nc2 {The knight has done its work on b4. I was rather afraid of it going to e3 now.} f4 {So I stop that, also anchoring his g and f pawns on white squares, where they can be attacked by my bishop. } 31. Na3 {The knight is coming round to c4 now. I had a long think here. I was originally going to play Kd7 32.	Nc4 Kc7 but then he has 33. Nd6 and the knight has reached a great square! Bd5 32. Nc4 Bxc4 33. bxc4 is a drawn king and pawn ending. b6-c5 allows the white king in on the black squares - 32. Kb4 Kd7 33. Kc5 Kc7. We looked at this position together afterwards. Black can still draw it, but has to be careful, white has a slight advantage. What would you play as black in the position dear reader?  } a5 {I plan to sacrifice the b pawn!} 32. Nc4 {Attacking the b pawn.} Ba6 {This is the point! If he takes the b pawn, my bishop goes to f1 and I start taking his king-side pawns.} 33. h4 {This is best, taking one of his pawns off a white square. I have to take the knight now, for instance, if I try h6 34. Nxb6 Bf1 35. Kd2 Bxg2 36. Ke2 and white is winning - his knight can return to c4 and then take my a pawn.} Bxc4 {So I take.} 34. bxc4 {He takes back.} h6 {I offer a draw, which was declined.} 35. Kb3 {Trying a queen-side pentration with his king. This is easily stopped.} Kd7 36. d5 {He mobilises his central pawn majority.} exd5 {I take.} 37. cxd5 {He takes back.} b5 {I push my b pawn.} 38. Ka3 {And finally drawn on white's offer.   Many thanks for reading. Please rate my annotation on the star system, and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
