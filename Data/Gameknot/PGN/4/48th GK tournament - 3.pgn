1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kann very solid.} 2. a4 {? Ok so we are out of book now, I look poorly on this move. There is an unspoken rule to think about here. Every Pawn move should be considered a waste of 3 tempo. the reason is very simple it takes in general 3 moves before that pawn becomes a threat. 2ndly this Pawn does nothing for the center. REMBER: Every pawn move also leaves a weakness in front and behind it.} d5 {I continue as normal. Why not?} 3. d3 {Had my opponent not played  (a4) we would now, be in a variation we Caro-Kann Players jokingly call "the Sneak" inwhich the white player plays a "KID"(Kings Indian Attack) The One Mainline is: 1.e4,c6 2.d3,e5 3.g3,d5 4.Bg2,Bd6 5.Nf3.Nf6...ect.} dxe4 {I actually made this move based on the fact that, White had played 2.a4 as you see whit has lost the intuitive in the center.} 4. dxe4 Qxd1+ {Now, white is stuck in the center of the board...However, this makes little difference as we are both now, in an end game...and I chose a somewhat insipid line. there is no real need to "Castle".} 5. Kxd1 e5 6. f3 {better is 6.Nf3 } Nf6 7. g4 {Nbd2 is stronger.} g6 8. Bg5 {8.Bc4 is better.} Bg7 9. a5 a6 {9...a6 the queenside is now closed...} 10. b4 { ??...No, really it is.} O-O 11. Bd3 {11.Bd3. I don't like this move It's ugly. the Bishop is Now BAD. and not really that active. I was here that I paused...and took a Deep look at my opponent. You can learn a much from your Opponents from his games. What pieces he prefers... the tact..and strategies...and most of all what he knows and doesn't. This character holds back his knights til the end game doesn't know how to use his Bishops...and dislikes trading pawns...Prefers closed games to open ones... rarely castles. Trades Queens. and always plays this weird line!!!! I began to Assess my Basics and deeply.Chaos was a comming.^-^So first I gave reason for the bishop (who is Pinning a ghost at the moment a reason to be there.} Rd8 12. h4 {Uh-oh here it comes.} h6 {put the question to the bishop. and this also pacifies my defense think of it as catching the pawns not attacking them. Now, don't get me wrong there are some dangerous lines here....But you find them.} 13. Be3 {Now, I've gotten the Bishop to move. What I now, see is Lite Squared weaknesses All for white the dark sqaures are very important and it's plain that the queenside and the center is the place to focus and I'll have to defend this ugly pawn storm. So, first My bishop goes to e6 where it will Eye the center of the board. My DSB is Bad But active. Protecting the e5 square.} Be6 {I was expecting King to 14. Kd2 with the Idea Nc3  or Na3 looking for c4... but no...} 14. Bb6 {How many move is that for the Bishop?} Rc8 {I know 14. Re8 is slightly better but I was planning the line : 15.Nd2,Nb-d7 16.Be3,c5 with the Idea Bf8 and counter attacking on the Queenside.} 15. Ne2 Nbd7 16. Be3 c5 {there were several continuation here that I found intresting for White. The first was...17. bxc5  which leads to  17... Nxc5  18.Bxc5,Rxc5 19.Nc3  Now, Black hyas a Backward pawn on the open B-file. It seem earier for white to coordinate His forces. } 17. b5 {This is the first real mistake. there is only one move here...no need to calculate. 17.b5?!    A.)17...c4 18.Nb-c3,cxd3 19.cxd3,axb5 20.g5,hxg5 21.hxg5,hxg5 22.Nxb5,Nc5 23.d4,Bc4 24.Nb-c3,Nd3 25.dxe5,Bxe5  -/=     B.)17...Nxc5 18.Nb-c3,h5 19.g5,Ne8 20.Rb1,Nd6 21.Kd2,Rc7 22.Nd5,Bxd5 23.exd5,Rd8 24.Rb6,Nxd3 25.Kxd3 =/=    C.)} c4 18. g5 {this doesn't save the pawn and it's a bit early... the Ne2 needs to go to c1!!!} hxg5 19. Bxg5 {Stronger is 19.hxg5  the Bishop shoould be where it was. It controls more space.} cxd3 {A minor piece a head.} 20. cxd3 axb5 {Now, a pawn.Here I saw the Idea of  21.Nc3,Bb3  22.Kd2,Nc5 23.Rg1, Ba4 25.Nxa4,Nxa4 26.Rg-c1...I didn't like the line...} 21. Kd2 Nc5 22. Ke3 Nh5 {I began my invasion of the lite and dark squares...there are tooo many weaknesses to chose from however black is not beaten yet.} 23. Be7 Bh6+ {The Idea here is to lure the Bishop to g5 so my bishop will go to f8.} 24. Kf2 {? oops! The d3 pawn is hanging. What was I saying about Nc1....} Nxd3+ {Here I my alarm bells went crazy as there should be a Mating net somewhere...the rule here is if you can control or take away 6 square from the king...you have him.look how many pieces are aroung the king!} 25. Kg2 {OOOOPPPSS!!!! 25.Kf1 is the only square.} Rc2 {White must play 26.Nc3} 26. f4 {?? not enough time and 3 pieces are attacking the pawn.} Rxe2+ 27. Kf3 {I missed this move!! I was a little upset that he found is then I saw ...} Bg4+ {this move protects the Rook and Attacks the King as well...the follow up move.... I know he must be frustrated, I did this same tactic against him the last game!!!} 28. Kxg4 {I wanted so badly to take on e4 but as they say when you find a good move look for a better one...} Re3 {this move prevents retreat...} 29. Rh3 {My opponent kindly offers a trade.} Nf2# {No thanks!!!}
