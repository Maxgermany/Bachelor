1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {I hate the G. Piano. I find it very boring, eventhough I lose to it a majority of the time.} Bc5 {3. .. Nf6 leads to the Two Knights Defense.} 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 {I believe this is the Giuoco Pianissimo. } O-O 6. c3 {With the intent of building a strong center.} d6 7. h3 h6 8. a4 a5 9. Be3 {I knew that this would lead to trouble since it will open up a file to my kingside. I believe this is addressed in one of Silman's books.} Bxe3 10. fxe3 d5 11. exd5 Nxd5 12. Qe2 Nf6 13. e4 Qe7 {I felt it was important to get the Queen of the file before White opened it.} 14. Nbd2 Be6 15. d4 Bxc4 16. Nxc4 exd4 17. e5 {This looked like the logical move enoughthough I thought White would have just taken the pawn. It created a few problems for me, like what to do with my knight and how to develop any initative. Upon reflection, the pawn is essentially pinned. } Nd5 {This move was a mistake. Better would have been Rfe8. At least here Black's knight on d5 radiates around itself from behind the pawn. I read that the knight is the best blockader because of this reason.} 18. cxd4 Rad8 19. Rad1 Qe6 20. Ne3 Rd7 21. Rd2 Rfd8 22. Rfd1 Nb6 23. Qb5 Nb4 24. Qxa5 Nb4d5 25. Nxd5 Nxd5 26. Qb5 c6 27. Qe2 f6 28. a5 Re7 29. a6 bxa6 30. Qxa6 Rf8 31. Rc1 Rc7 32. Qc4 Kh8 33. b4 Rfc8 34. Rdc2 fxe5 35. dxe5 Nf4 36. Qxf4 {Being down a full piece and pawn, there was no point in continuing at this point.}
