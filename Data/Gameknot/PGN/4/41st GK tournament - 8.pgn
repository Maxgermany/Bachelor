1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Here I was expecting either ...,Bc5 taking into Guico pianso lines or ...,Nf6 stering into 2N Defence but... } Nh6 {Black surprises & develops his piece on the rim (viloating the basic rule develop your pieces towards the center); Anyway white now goes for the center p break with} 4. d4 Ng4 {Black probably expected 5.dxe4 & so he comes down with the text but breaks another principle - Do not move piece twice unless necessary! but white simply plays} 5. h3 {Driving off the N before taking the central e5-p.} Nf6 {With no good choice black has to retreat the N & in the process he counters whites central e4-p. White now has 2 good replies Nxe5 or dxe5 & he prefers the latter} 6. dxe5 {The point now was what Black would do? will he captures whites e4-p or retreat the N to g8 & to my surprise he prefers the former} Nxe4 {Black obviously is either punch drunk or overlooks whites coming next move} 7. Qd5 {Sets Q-B battery on the diagonal a2-g8- with dual threat of either Qxe4 picking the N or Qxf7 # How will Black react?} Nxf2 {Probably hoping Kxf2 ; but  it seems black cracks in the heat of pressure & misses the #} 8. Qxf7# {A good example on how waste of time & tempo whips the attack for the opponent !}
