1. e4 c5 {I love Sicilian...} 2. Bc4 e6 3. e5 {e5?! Strange manoeuvre.} Qg5 {Qg5!} 4. Nf3 Qxg2 {And I gain a pawn.} 5. Rg1 Qh3 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. Rg3 Qh5 8. Nb5 Nxe5 {Nxe5! It could seem a blunder, but, for me, it isn't.} 9. Nc7+ Kd8 10. Nxa8 Nxc4 11. d3 Na5 12. Bf4 d6 13. Qd2 b6 14. b4 Bb7 15. bxa5 Bxa8 {Bxa8? This is a little mistake. I think the best move for me was Bxf3.} 16. axb6 Bxf3 {Bxf3? Another blunder for me. axb6 was better.} 17. bxa7 Ke8 18. Rb1 Bc6 19. Rb8+ Ke7 20. Qa5 Kf6 21. Rg5 Qf3 {White is down, but he's attacking well.} 22. Qd8+ Be7 23. Qc8 Qh1+ 24. Kd2 h6 25. Rg1 {Rg1!? This move can let the white promote with 25...Qxg1 26.Qxc6 and black can't avoid 2 Queens......} Qxg1 26. Qxc6 Qxf2+ {But of course I wanna take some pieces!} 27. Kc1 {Kc1? This move loses tempo.} Qxf4+ 28. Kb1 Qf1+ 29. Kb2 Kg5 {To free f6 square for the B.} 30. a8=Q Bf6+ 31. Kb3 Qb1+ 32. Ka3 Qc1+ 33. Ka4 Qxc2+ 34. Kb5 Qxd3+ {Check, check, check and check again!} 35. Kb6 Be5 36. Qcg2+ {Now white is down a point, even if, for me, he should do everything to capture my pawns.....Because maybe those pawns are more important than my Queen.} Kf6 37. Rxg8 Rxg8 38. Qxg8 g5 39. Qb7 {Qb7!.....and now Qb1  looks like the only good solution..} Qb1+ 40. Kc7 d5+ 41. Kc8 Qxb7+ 42. Kxb7 Bxh2 43. Qh8+ Ke7 {Here endgame starts. Ke7! and not Kg6.} 44. Qxh6 Bf4 45. Qh3 c4 46. Qc3 f6 47. a4 Be5 48. Qc2 c3 49. a5 f5 50. a6 Bd4 {Unluckily I gotta sac my B......I should be finished....} 51. a7 Bxa7 52. Kxa7 d4 {Wow! 5 pawns against a Q.....Who will win?} 53. Qa2 Kd6 54. Qa6+ Kd5 55. Qb7+ Ke5 56. Qc7+ Ke4 57. Qc6+ Ke5 58. Qc5+ {Now black checks!} Ke4 59. Qc4 e5 60. Kb6 Ke3 61. Kc5 {I don't know.......Maybe Queen's moves was better than King's?} Kd2 62. Kd5 c2 63. Kxe5 c1=Q {And I'm up!.........even if.....} 64. Qxd4+ {No......with this move the game is drawn (I think). But maybe with a white's blunder.....} Ke2 {I won't give up!} 65. Kxf5 Qf4+ {Only a fool would move Kg6 or Ke6....But that was the only opportunity I really had....} 66. Qxf4 gxf4 67. Kxf4 {Game drawn.....dead position. What about this game, guys?  P.S. Happy new year!}
