1. e4 {This is a game OTB, me versus a co-worker of mine.  He and I go back and forth accordingly when we play.  This game had a few interesting positions so I figured I would annotate.} c5 2. e5 {I have no clue why he does this, I guess to pressure my advancement.  I doubt it's a sound move.} Nc6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Bb5 Bd7 5. Bxc6 {He told me before the game that his sole opening was to take both my knights early.  He thinks I'm too sneaky with them. } Bxc6 6. d4 e6 7. Be3 b6 8. O-O Ne7 {Looking back I now realize I should've attacked his pawn early with a pawn.  I am not much for this move. } 9. Bg5 h6 10. Be3 Nf5 11. Qd2 Be7 12. b3 Rb8 13. a4 O-O {delayed long enough...} 14. Na3 Qc7 15. c3 c4 16. b4 Bxa4 17. Bf4 g5 {I had a serious internal struggle on whether to do this move.  I hate messing up my pawn structure, but I felt it was about to be relinquished of solidarity in a moment anyhow. } 18. Be3 Be8 {sending bishop to help in case of attack.} 19. g4 Nxe3 20. fxe3 f5 21. h3 fxg4 22. hxg4 h5 23. Nh2 h4 24. Rxf8+ Bxf8 25. Rf1 Bg6 26. Rf6 {I marked this as a good move. } Bf7 27. Nb5 Qd7 28. Qf2 Rb7 29. Na3 Qa4 30. Qa2 Qd1+ {These 2 queen moves are exactly why they say do not attempt an attack with just one piece.....even if it is the queen.  Watch my upcoming problems.} 31. Rf1 Qd3 32. Nb5 h3 {I was hunting for a little trickery with my pawn advancement....} 33. Nd6 Bxd6 34. exd6 Qxe3+ 35. Qf2 Qxc3 {i was feeling rather comfortable at this point...} 36. Nf3 {After this move I knew I was in trouble.  His N reaching e5 is big trouble for me when his pawn advances....my resources would be takin aback and allow for an onslaught by his queen/rook on the same file. } Be8 {I "thought" it was a good idea to help out with the pawn, but this move was my downfall. } 37. Ne5 {It wasn't until he moved here that I realized that his queen can just run down to f8 } Kh7 38. d7 {He did this for me to move my bishop.  It doesn't really matter what I do at this point he wins. } Bxd7 39. Qf7+ Kh8 40. Ng6# {}
