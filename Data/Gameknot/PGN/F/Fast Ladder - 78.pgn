1. e4 {Here is a just finished ladder game in the Fischer-Sozin variation of the Sicilian Najdorf.  I have only recently started playing 2...d6 in the Sicilian and as a result, my opponent takes me out of book by move 9.} c5 {I won't be annotating every move as I will assume most of you are familiar with the opening moves, however, we do reach the variation by a move order transposition.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {More typical is 3. d4 or 3. Bb5+} Nf6 {Attacking the e-pawn and inviting the advance 4. e5, when 4...de; 5. Nxe5 e6 causes Black no problems.} 4. Nc3 {Still postponing the advance of the d-pawn.} e6 {Here I opt to keep my Queen's knight flexible and commit to the Scheveningen setup rather than the ...e5 systems after the White knight lands on d4.} 5. d4 {After this move we transpose into the main lines of the Fischer-Sozin.} cxd4 6. Nxd4 a6 7. O-O {According to my opening book, White has tried no less than 9 different moves here.  7. Bb3, 7. Be3 and 7. Bg5 are the more standard continuations.} b5 {Swatting the bishop and clearing a path for the light-squared bishop to come to b7.  This will weaken the e6-square and as we will see in a few moves, White can often sacrifice on this square.} 8. Bb3 {The only strategically consistent move.} Be7 {Preparing to castle.} 9. f3 {I hadn't seen this move in any of my preparation.  Qf3, f4, a3, a4, and Be3 are all standard moves.  I decide to play as if the bishop had come to e3 and wait to see how white would continue his attacking scheme.} O-O 10. Be3 {White's setup seems a little passive, so I decide to let him sacrifice on e6, as I will have the two bishops in an open position and an open f-file for the 1 pawn equivalent material investment.} Bb7 {Allowing...} 11. Bxe6 {White gets 2 pawns and a rook for the two minors, but material isn't everything!!! Still the position should be balanced, but I might be a little optimistic.} fxe6 12. Nxe6 Qc8 {I want to capture with the queen and leave the d7-square free for the knight to jump into c5.} 13. Nxf8 Qxf8 14. a4 {I was anticipating this move or Qd3, with play against the weak d-pawn and, with a later a4, play against my queenside.} b4 {Keeping lines closed and kicking the knight away from its observation of d5.  The knight can't jump in right away due to 15...Nxd5; 16. ed Qf5 and Black's pieces are coming active.} 15. Ne2 {15. Na2 a5; 16. c3 was another way to play actively for white.  Here the knight can come to f4, where it once again eyes d5.} Nbd7 {Heading for c5.} 16. c4 {White clamps down on d5!  A good move by my opponent and one that is strategically consistent with the previous knight move.  16...bc e.p. does allow the knight to come back to c3, but more importantly it allows 17. Qb3+ forking the king and bishop on b7.} Nc5 {Ramping up pressure on e4 and getting my knights to active positions.  The dark-squared bishop is a little lame, but I have plans to activate it with ...Nfd7 and ...Bf6.} 17. Ng3 {d4 or f4 are other options.  I'm guessing he wants to go to f5 to attack my isolated d-pawn.} Nfd7 {Clearing a path for my passive bishop.} 18. Bxc5 {I think this is really where the tide turns strategically.  3-1 minor piece ratio to black and I have the two bishops.  It's not over for White, but I have the initiative.} Nxc5 19. Nf5 Bf6 {Ignoring the threat to the d-pawn as Nxd6 is met with ...Rd8, and 20. Qxd6 Qxd6; 21. Nxd6 Bc6 and my dark-squared bishop will win back the pawn with swarming minor pieces.} 20. Rb1 {White's rook dont have any other file that the d line to operate on.} Rd8 {Consolidating and activating my last piece.} 21. Rf2 {White has really only one plan to get any play, to operate against the d-pawn.} a5 {Continuing to improve my position.} 22. Rd2 {Ramping up pressure which is easily neutralized.  The pressure on e4, combined with the position of the white knight means that the white pawns will have a hard time advancing without allowing tactics on the e4-square.} Be5 23. g3 {f4 is not a threat.} Rd7 24. f4 {Here Rc1 or b3 would have left black clearly better, but there would still be work to do.  This move loses on the spot.} Nxe4 {Now the White knight hangs and black threatens to recover the rook.  The e5 bishop is off limits due to ...Nxd2, when the b1 rook is hit and the knight of f5 still hangs.} 25. Rd3 {Drops a clean piece.} Qxf5 {White can resign as the e5-bishop is off limits due to mate in two.  However, my opponent takes anyway.} 26. fxe5 Qf2+ 27. Kh1 Nxg3# {Double check and mate.}
