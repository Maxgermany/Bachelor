1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 {As I don't remember seeing 2. Bf4 ever before, I decided to open cautiously and play a reactive game until the position established itself.} 3. Nf3 e6 4. Ne5 Nxe5 {Alternatives were Bd7 to recapture with the Bishop, or letting it be and developing Nf6.  While the text lets off pressure on White's QP, it gives a tempo as the Bishop can be chased.} 5. Bxe5 Nf6 6. a3 {Clearly to prevent 6. ... Bb4+ but in fact merely wastes a move.} Be7 7. Nc3 O-O 8. h3 {This move is unclear to me.  Black's Queen's Bishop is undeveloped and in fact blocked behind the King's pawn, and White needs the time to develop elsewhere.} b6 9. Nb5 {Another speculative piece of aggression.} Bd6 {Offering the Bishop.  In almost any event, due to White's lack of development Black gets a dominant center and pressure on White's Queen's pawn.} 10. Nxd6 cxd6 11. Bh2 Bb7 12. e3 Rc8 13. Be2 Qc7 {Preparing for e5 and probable exchange to follow.} 14. c3 a6 {Probably not the best because it commits the Bishop to defence of the side pawn.  However, circumscribing White's bishop seems worthwhile.} 15. O-O Rfe8 16. Rc1 e5 {Moment of truth.  White's best option is likely 17. c4 to counter, even if it loses the pawn eventually.} 17. dxe5 dxe5 18. f4 e4 19. f5 Qc5 {A speculative line.  If White defends correctly, it's a bit of a waste but on 20. ... c5 the Queen has a retreat.} 20. b4 Qxe3+ 21. Kh1 Rxc3 22. Bg1 Qxc1 23. Qxc1 Rxc1 24. Rxc1 Rc8 25. Rxc8+ {Black is up two pawns: White is in a bind as he ought to keep the Rook, but cannot give control of the only open file to Black.  His only advantage now is the two Bishops, which are insufficient.} Bxc8 26. Bxb6 Bxf5 27. Bxa6 Ne8 28. Bb5 Nd6 29. Bf1 Bd7 30. Bc7 Nc4 31. b5 Bxb5 32. Bxc4 Bxc4 {Opposite color Bishops make for a draw, but not when Black is up two pawns, and two are passed!  White needed to avoid the piece exchange instead of seeking it out.  Black's play to finish is, I think, imprecise, but gets the job done eventually.} 33. a4 d4 34. Bf4 e3 35. Kg1 f6 36. a5 g5 37. Bg3 Be2 38. Bd6 Bc4 39. Bb4 d3 40. Kf1 e2+ 41. Ke1 h5 42. g3 Kf7 43. Bd2 Kg6 44. Kf2 f5 45. Ke3 h4 {45. ... g4 is better, to avoid disconnecting the pawns.} 46. gxh4 gxh4 47. Kd4 Ba6 48. Kc5 Kf6 49. Kb6 Bc4 50. a6 Bxa6 51. Kxa6 Ke5 52. Kb5 f4 53. Kc4 Ke4 54. Kc3 f3 55. Be1 Ke3 56. Bd2+ Kf2 57. Kxd3 e1=Q 58. Bxe1+ Kxe1 59. Ke3 f2 60. Kf3 f1=Q+ 61. Kg4 Ke2 62. Kxh4 Kf3 63. Kh5 Kf4 {63. ... Qxh3 probably finishes faster.} 64. h4 Qh3 65. Kg6 Qf5+ 66. Kh6 Kg4 67. h5 Qxh5+ 68. Kg7 Kf5 69. Kf8 Qh7 70. Ke8 Ke6 71. Kd8 Qd7# {Checkmate.}
