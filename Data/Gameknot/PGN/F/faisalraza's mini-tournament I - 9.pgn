1. d4 {It was a nice sharp game by white, I've sacrificed a pawn to activate my a rook, then white managed to exchange a knight for three pawns and exposed my king in consequence of this, for some more moves I tried to explore the more active pieces I had and attack black's castle but my opponent found all the appropriate defenses so when draw was proposed I accepted immediately...} Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. g3 d5 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O {a symmetrical position let's see if white breaks it with Bg5...} 6. Bg5 {and he does} Ne4 {Ne4 and now I expect Bf4 all others seams clearly worst for white} 7. Be3 {? fairly defensive... over protects the d pawn, and get himself in a very cramped position} c6 8. Nbd2 Nd6 {avoids the exchange of knights} 9. c3 {the pawn structure is again symmetrical...} Qb6 10. Nb3 a5 {now white needs a4 to prevent black's a4} 11. Qc1 {he might want to exchange dark squared bishops with Bh6} a4 {so I get to play a4 now white has either Nc5 with the idea of a latter Nd3 or he can play Nd2 in to a cramped position... I think he will chose Nc5 as his previous move might indicate he wants to exchange dark squared bishops and Nd2 prevents that...} 12. Nc5 Nc4 {aimed at e3} 13. b3 {axb3 axb3 and Rxa1 with the idea of Nxe3 to force double pawns on the e column or axb3 Nxb3 forced to avoid Bh6 that forces me to exchange my best bishop} Nxe3 {now I must open the position to gain advantage for my bishop pair} 14. Qxe3 Re8 {places the rook on the same column as white's queen while sacrificing the a pawn to open the column and activate my a rook} 15. Nxa4 Qa7 {the idea is to keep an eye on d4 and the white queen, also prepares to push the b pawn if needed} 16. Nc5 e5 {sacrifices another pawn to open the e column, now white has to deal with the threat on white's queen...} 17. Nxe5 {the knight is pinned, but a very dangerous moment for black, now if f6 aimed to wining the knight immediately, white have Nxc6 ignoring the pin and threatening my queen, which wins them another pawn, so I need Re7 because now if Nxc6 Nxc6 and the rook is defended by the knight a very sharp game so far, black sacrificed to pawns to get activity but white keeps finding some forcing moves to keep his threats coming at a steady pace...} Re7 {forced, prevents Nxc6, as Nxc6 defends the rook, now probably Qg5 and only then f6 for black } 18. Qg5 f6 {as planed} 19. Nxg6 {of course I've missed this... white sacrifices the knight for two pawns, and exposes my king, still as IM Daniel Rensch, states in his video "Unbalanced Material: Minor Pieces vs Pawn", there is nothing a pawn can do, that a piece can't do better, and a minor piece can at least deal with three and even up to four pawns sucessfully..., so I 'll try turn  to this pawn "hecatomb" in a win!} hxg6 {the only good move if fxg5 Nxe7+ forking king and bishop and white has too much compensation for the queen} 20. Qxg6 Nd7 {I need to regroup on the king's wing to attack white's castle...} 21. Nd3 {and the same does white} Nf8 {this or Qa5 to bring it back to the center via d8 or c7, I've chosen Nf8 winning a tempo to play Be6 to as it is more straight foreword, Qa5 just takes to much time... } 22. Qh5 Be6 {now bringing in the other rook, I must try to use the open columns to attack white's king} 23. Qf3 Qb8 {to bring the queen back in to the action} 24. Nf4 {via h5 with tempo} Bd7 {was this or Bf7 and although the position of the bishop on f7 might seam better, if Nh5 I would probably eventually have to capture it because I've had cut my rook's access to g7 and h7, so I preferred the alternative Bd7} 25. Nh5 Qe8 {inviting Qxf6, to remove another blocking pawn from the front of white's castled king} 26. Qxf6 Nh7 27. Qh4 Rxe2 {infiltrates the 7nd rank, and is aimed at f2} 28. Nxg7 {and now white exchanges N vs B but is the dark squared bishop, I disliked the idea of keeping opposite color bishops on board} Kxg7 {and white's queen is restricted enough next Qf7 will bring my queen to a more attacking square, eventually Rf8 will be played} 29. a4 Qf7 {with an eye on f2 and f3, preventing both Rfe1 and Bf3} 30. c4 dxc4 {natural} 31. bxc4 Qf6 {I've considered also playing Qxc4, but this achieved nothing...} 32. Qh5 {and white proposed a draw which I accepted, it hard to get anything from the position other than a draw, and the risk in losing is great...}
