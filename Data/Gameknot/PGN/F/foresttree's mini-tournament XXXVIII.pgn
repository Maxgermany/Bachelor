Ke2 Qxe4+ 6. Kf2 {That surprised me, b-e3 would have been my choice.} Ng4+ 7. Kg3 Bd6+ {Still not expecting much, just taking the opportunity to develop unopposed.} 8. Kh3 {Bad move, bad bad move. Not a lot of choices, as it allows me a fork on K/Q....} Nf2# {Oh. Right. Well ok then. No I didn't realise. I was just being greedy and nabbing the queen I thought. Sorry ;-)}
