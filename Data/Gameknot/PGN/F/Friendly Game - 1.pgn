[Opening "Petrov (C42), French attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Petrov's defence.} 3. Nxe5 Qe7 {This is where things change a little.} 4. d4 d6 5. Nf3 Nxe4 {The crux of the opening is based around white's next move.} 6. Bd3 {Bce2 or Qe2 would save White his queen.} Nc3+ {And a beautiful discovered attack wins black the queen. At this point black resigns.  Note that this opening is fairly dangerous to play because it allows white to develop much quicker than black. However, it is a fun little opening that basically wins you the game when it works!}
