1. Nf3 {definitely an opening I'm not used to} Nf6 {my option goes to the most common answer to Nf3} 2. Nc3 {most common are c4, g3 or d4. } d5 3. e3 e6 {allowing the B to come to play} 4. a3 {thinking about my B} Nc6 {in this phase I'm putting pieces to play} 5. d3 Bd6 6. Qe2 O-O {and protecting my K} 7. b4 {according to the game analysis this was a mistake. next moves would be: 7. b4 a5 8. b5 Ne5 9. Bd2 Bd7 10. a4 Neg4 11. h3 Ne5 12. Rb1 Qe7 13. g4 Nxf3+ 14. Qxf3 Be5} a6 8. e4 dxe4 {e5 was a threat. between retiring the B or the N or reinforcing the defense of e5, I preferred  taking the pawn} 9. dxe4 Ne5 {putting pressure on the N and opening the d rank} 10. Bb2 Bd7 {in here my idea was to limit the action of the N while moving the B to the battlefield} 11. Nxe5 Bxe5 12. g3 Bb5 {funny situation. putting pressure on the Q knowing that the N could take the B. if the Q moves away I was thinking about exchanging B's with the idea of making castle on the ideal side impossible.} 13. Nxb5 {the error was made} Bxb2 14. Rb1 Be5 {moving away with the B while keeping the pressure on Nb5} 15. Rd1 {the natural attack from white. This is the moment I decide a crazy attack  game analysis tells me that the way to go would be: â€¦ Qe8 16. f4 Bxf4 17. gxf4 axb5 18. Qxb5 Qxb5 19. Bxb5 Rxa3 20. O-O Nxe4 21. Rd7 Nc3 22. Bc4 b5 23. Bd3} axb5 {sacrificing the Q  the idea with this ladder games is to be bold on the approach to the game.   In Team games and Tournaments I would never would try this} 16. Rxd8 Bc3+ 17. Kd1 {White's big error. Rd2 would level things up} Rfxd8+ {from now on things are lost for white} 18. Kc1 Rxa3 {... and I was happy with it!}
