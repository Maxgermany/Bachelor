1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 {Queen's gambit Accepted} 3. e4 {grab centre control.. I can regain the pawn at will (theoretically)} b5 {he protects the advanced pawn} 4. a3 {I don't want a pawn rush this early} Bb7 {challenging my control of the center} 5. Nc3 {protecting my e4 pawn} e6 {opening a lane for his black bishop} 6. Nf3 {preparing to castle} h6 {I guess he feared Bg5} 7. Nxb5 {abandoning my e4 pawn, but I can gain a pawn on the exchange} Bxe4 {he grabs the unprotected pawn} 8. Bxc4 {I do likewise} Bd6 {he prepares to castle} 9. Nxd6+ {don't know why I did that, just didn't like the bishop} Qxd6 {I think I would have taken it with the pawn} 10. O-O {put the king in a safe place} Nf6 {now he's ready to castle...} 11. Qa4+ {so I'll delay him} Nbd7 12. Ne5 {just to irritate him...} O-O {I would have played Qxd4, but he castles} 13. Nxd7 {I don't like knights (particularly in pairs)} Nxd7 14. Qd1 {I finally notice my pawn is naked} Nb6 {attacking my bishop} 15. Bb3 {I run away like a "girly-man"} Bb7 {so does he (I have no idea why)} 16. Qg4 {back to attack mode} g5 {a weak move, in my opinion} 17. Re1 {I threaten to total expose the kings clothing} Kh7 {not a good hiding place} 18. Re5 {a plan forms} Qc6 {mate in one if I leave the g-file unprotected} 19. Bxg5 {continuing with my plan, but keeping a close eye on g2 protection} hxg5 {the plan is going as forseen} 20. Qh5+ {I can temporarily abandon g2 protection} Kg7 {I guess Kg8 was wishful thinking} 21. Qxg5+ {force him back and protect g2} Kh7 22. Qh5+ {mistake.. Qh4 was better} Kg7 23. Qg5+ {let's try this again...} Kh7 24. Qh4+ {ok... back on track} Kg7 25. Rg5+ Kf6 {forced} 26. Rh5+ {discovered check forces him back to the g-file} Kg7 {either way, Qg5 is mate} 27. Qg5# {}
