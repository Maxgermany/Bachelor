1. e4 c5 2. Qf3 {making a statement, right from the beginning: White is going for the King...} g6 {White will at least need another move, to make this work somehow: that gives Black time to work on this Bulgarian variation of the Sicilian...} 3. Bc4 {obviously, but Black is fully ready...} e6 {in line, with Blacks' development...} 4. d3 {preparing interference from Bc1: but that cannot harm Black yet...} Qf6 {breaking Whites' attack, before it even started...} 5. Qg3 {of course, Qxf6, Nxf6, would be a gross loss of tempo for White: but maybe best...} Nc6 {threatening Nb4/Nd4...} 6. c3 {only defense...} h6 {countering Bg5...} 7. f4 h5 {after e5, we might consider h4...} 8. e5 Qf5 9. Nf3 Qg4 {or just this: keep pushing for trading Queens...} 10. Qf2 a6 {creating more space...} 11. h3 Qf5 12. Nh4 {White succeeded in trapping the Black Queen: at the cost of several minutes, while Black is just fortifying his position...} Nce7 13. Nxf5 Nxf5 14. Nd2 b5 15. Bb3 Be7 {just making complications: meanwhile, White is struggling with the clock...} 16. Ne4 Bh4 17. g3 Nxg3 18. Nxg3 Bb7 {anything goes: Black had still several minutes to spare...} 19. Rg1 Ne7 {preparing castling and Nf5...} 20. Qxc5 {the Queen needs to get out of the pin: but this greed will not help...} O-O 21. Qb6 Rab8 22. Qd4 {forced: after Nf5, Black is still in control; but Whites' clock ran out, right at the last move...}
