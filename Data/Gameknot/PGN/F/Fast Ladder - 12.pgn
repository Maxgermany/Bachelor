1. d4 {Standard opening move.} Nf6 {I opted with leading with my Nf6. I have preferred opening with the N when playing black. At the same time, if my opponent had lead with e4, I would have been inclined to lead off with Nc6. Previous experience has shown that my opponents will attempt to chase my N if I play too close to their lead pawn. I dont like that. } 2. Nc3 d5 {I decided to match his pawn as well as provide some resistance to the e4 when it comes out. It would leave me with a favorable material lead if my opponent recaptures. } 3. Nf3 g6 4. e4 dxe4 5. Nxe4 Nxe4 6. Bb5+ c6 7. Ba4 Qa5+ 8. Bd2 {I had a few options here. I could capture either of his B's or retreat my Q. In the end I decided to capture the DSB and sac my N. } Nxd2 9. Qxd2 Qxd2+ {Then my Q. I wanted to remove pieces from the battlespace. So far, if I have the advantage early I like to trade if the situation presents itself and I determine it to be favorable. Either my opponent would lose tempo and capture with his N, which in turn I threaten on my next move with Bh6 or he can capture with his K removing the opportunity for castling later and again I threaten with Bh6.   Computer analysis indicates I should have captured the B on a4 instead. } 10. Kxd2 Bh6+ 11. Kd1 f6 12. Re1 Nd7 13. Re2 Nb6 14. Bb3 Bd7 15. Ke1 O-O-O {I castled Q side simply due to what I saw as the better protection I was provided. Granted, since both Q's were off the board I probably did not have to castle. However, I saw no harm and kept my K tucked safely away. } 16. Rd1 Bf5 17. c4 e5 18. d5 cxd5 19. Kf1 {An oversight here leads me into a mean looking fork on my R and N. I choose to protect my R.} Rd6 {This move opened the door for my opponent to regain his footing in the match. I noticed it immediately after playing that I erred in my play. Computer analysis shows a large swing in my opponents direction because of it. } 20. c5 Rd7 21. cxb6 axb6 22. Ba4 Rd6 {I lost some of my advantage as well as tempo. However I still had the edge if albeit slight. } 23. b4 Kc7 24. Bb5 Bd7 {My opponent was supposed to capture my B. However I think he wanted to maintain his pieces considering the direction that match was heading. } 25. Bd3 {Computer analysis says that I should have played e4 vice Ba4. Either move forces my opponent further into the defense. However, I still think I prefer Ba4. } Ba4 26. Bc2 Bb5 {I am sure I could have played that cat and mouse game for another turn. However there was little point. In the end, I gained the edge on his LSB and forced movements, in my opinion. } 27. Bd3 Kc6 {I left my B in place and moved my K into position to claim revenge if my opponent choose to sac his B. Trading materials here was fine with me given the current situation. I felt I could outmaneuver my opponent with what was on the board.   The computer did not like this move at all. It wanted me to continue with moving my B to a4 again.} 28. Bxb5+ Kxb5 29. Ne1 {I am not entirely sure what the purpose being that move was. However, it did not effect me.} Re8 30. g3 Kxb4 31. Rc2 e4 {I honestly cannot recall the logic I had with this move. It seems a bit odd looking back on it now. } 32. a4 {Again, this move caught me as a little awkward. It advanced his pawn but for little purpose other than making room for his R's. Other than that it did not lead to any development and left me more room to arrange my pieces. } Rc6 {The computer said I was better suited to move Red8. I do not see how that would change the situation much at all. } 33. a5 bxa5 {The computer analysis would rather me have moved Rxc2. This would have prevented the situation that followed in a few moves. However I already saw that coming and it was not a concern. I would be able to maneuver through the situation with ease from my point of view. } 34. Rb1+ Ka3 {My other option would have been checkmate. I had already played through that scenario and was ready for it. } 35. Rcb2 Rec8 {I had not fully thought of all of my pieces during this move. I was locked in on the right half of my board. The computer recommended me moving Rc1 at this point and I would concur. However, the change in advantage was minimal. } 36. Rb2b5 Ka4 {Again, I was more comfortable moving towards my pieces where I had better chances for evasion. } 37. Rb1b2 Rc6c5 {Again, I could have easily moved my B to c1. I still think I made a solid move. I conceded a pawn however I was developing the pieces in my favor.} 38. Rb5xb7 Bc1 39. Ra2+ {In most other arrangements, I would have been checkmated. However, the layout on the board suited me just well. I had enough options to not be worried. } Ba3 40. Rb1 Rc5c1 {Finally, I start moving my pieces to erode the walls his R's have emplaced around my K. } 41. Rba1 Rxa1 42. Rxa1 Rc1 43. Ra2 {That was the only safe position for his R and I was squarely on the offensive again. } Kb3 {Move, counter move was the theme for the next few lines. } 44. Rd2 Bb4 45. Rxd5 Rxe1+ 46. Kg2 a4 47. Rd7 {The threat on my h7 pawn was nothing to concern me. I had an open lane to promotion.} a3 48. Rxh7 a2 49. Ra7 Ba3 {Setting up the blockade helped ensure I would promote my pawn. } 50. f3 {My opponent had no options of value.} exf3+ 51. Kf2 a1=Q {Opponent resigns. }
