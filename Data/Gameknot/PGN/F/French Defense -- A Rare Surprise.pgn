1. e4 e6 {Al and I have had a running argument over the French for about 20 years now. Against 1. e4 he plays other defenses so seldom they're not even worth mentioning, and his knowledge of the various lines of the French is almost encyclopedic. In other words, when we have this little argument he's usually the one who wins.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {The Tarrasch variation, is a more positional treatment than the sharper Winawer variation with 3. Nc3.} c5 4. exd5 cxd4 {The book line is 4. ed4. Perhaps that's the case because of what occurs next.} 5. Bb5+ Bd7 6. dxe6 Bxb5 {?! -- I think 6. ...fe6 was called for.} 7. exf7+ Kxf7 8. Qh5+ g6 9. Qxb5 Qe7+ 10. Kf1 {Maybe a little awkward, but this move places White's King on an extremely safe square without impeding development of anything but the KR.} Nc6 11. Ngf3 Bh6 12. Nb3 Bd2 {This was the mouse-slip that spoiled the game. Obviously the intended move was 12. ...Bc1 after which 13. Rc1 with a sharp game.}
