1. d4 d5 2. e3 Bf5 3. c4 e6 {my usual approach in any Queens' pawn opening or Queens' Gambit: release the LSB, and cover d5 twice; after Nc3, Black might always consider Bb4 and hold pressure against cxd5...} 4. a3 {shielding off Bb4 and a possible check, obviously preparing Nc3...} Bd6 5. h3 {a weak move, although h2 is not out of possible danger after c6 and Qc7: more daring was c5, and Black must lose a - not very important - tempo with Be7...} b6 {also possible was a direct c5! or the obligate Bxb1: here, Black is preparing both; not making any commitments yet...} 6. cxd5 {or else Black will play c5...} Bxb1 {one of the objectives of 2. ... Bf5: after moving c2, Nb1 is obsolete...} 7. Rxb1 exd5 {locking up the center...} 8. Qc2 {White is already fishing in murky waters...} Nf6 9. Bb5+ c6 {played in the spur of the moment: of course, White has to take the pawn; the Bishop has no real other option: upon retreating, Black will play c5 eventually; after Ba4, a6 or even a direct b5, White has tough choices to make...} 10. Bxc6+ Nxc6 11. Qxc6+ Ke7 {this pawn sacrifice must have been an unpleasant surprise for White: this simple developing move of Blacks' King virtually wins the opening; White gets a lot of tempi behind, due to trailing far behind in development...} 12. Nf3 Qc7 13. Qxc7+ Bxc7 14. O-O Rhe8 {of course, preparing Kf8...} 15. Bd2 Ne4 16. Rbc1 Bd6 17. b4 Kf8 18. Rfd1 {White has to find a way, to develop Nf3: so cover Bd2; not sure, if that is the best...} a5 19. bxa5 bxa5 20. a4 Bb4 21. Bxb4+ axb4 {in a series of 'forced' moves, Black has succeeded in creating a passed pawn: but also a4 needs to be guarded, from both sides; a very explosive situation...} 22. Rca1 Rec8 {when in doubt, always conquer the open files...} 23. Ne5 Nc3 {the start of trouble for White...} 24. Rd2 b3 {not quite what White was looking for...} 25. Nd7+ Ke7 26. Nc5 {hard to say, if Nb6 was a better option: Black has a lot of threats here, so White decides to secure at least a4 and attack b3; Blacks' reply is practically forced...} Rxc5 27. dxc5 Rxa4 28. Rxa4 Nxa4 {suddenly, White is in big trouble: he had too little time on the clock, to work out the dire consequences of b2 - a direct Rd1 is met with Nxc5, followed by Kd6, or even a direct Nc3!!; after Rd3, b2, Rb3, Kd7!, followed by Kc6, and of course Rxd5, b2, Rd1 (c5 is blocking the possibly saving Rb5), Nc3!!, also leads to big problems - so he resigned; and (re)blocked the 'moderator' account...}
