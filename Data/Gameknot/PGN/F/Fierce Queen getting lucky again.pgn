1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. c3 {White had better, in a direct d4...} Bg7 4. Bc4 e6 5. d3 {still no d4: White will be sorry...} Ne7 6. Bg5 O-O 7. Nbd2 f6 8. Be3 d5 {the mother of all moves, in the Sicilian...} 9. exd5 exd5 {refuting Bc4 in the White opening...} 10. Bb3 b6 11. Rg1 {not sure what happens here: a failed attempt to castle short?} Bb7 12. Qe2 {preparing castling long: but the White Queen is far from safe...} Nf5 {after Re8, White can expect a lot of trouble...} 13. O-O-O {forced...} Ba6 {making the White Queen a new target: c5-c4, will break up the White center...} 14. Qf1 Nc6 15. g4 {now, the object of Rg1 becomes somewhat clear...} Nxe3 16. fxe3 Ne5 {forcing White to take Ne5: pawn d3 cannot be lost...} 17. Nxe5 fxe5 18. Qh3 Qg5 {just picking out, the weaker pieces of the pack: this move creates multiple pins over the White King...} 19. Rde1 c4 {maybe a bit too soon: first Kh8 was to be preferred: but hey, this is blitz...} 20. dxc4 dxc4 21. Nxc4 Rac8 {things are becoming clear: Whites' King is in trouble...} 22. Nxb6+ Kh8 {indeed a flaw, in Blacks' game: but it does not matter anymore...} 23. Nxc8 Rxc8 24. Kb1 {an unnecessary fault: but what is White supposed to do?} Bd3+ 25. Ka1 e4 26. Qg3 {White needs to take action: not sure, if this is helping...} Rxc3 {played from the gut: of course, this is no good; after Qb2+, Black is in big trouble: but White was not paying attention...} 27. bxc3 Bxc3# {the winner is always right...}
