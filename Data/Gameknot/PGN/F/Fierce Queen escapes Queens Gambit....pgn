1. d4 d5 2. c4 Bf5 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nc3 Bb4 {although I am fully aware of the fact that my approach to the Queens Gambit is rather peculiar, I still seem to stick to this... I believe in playing the Bishop of the white squares, before e6; it is true, that this puts it in jeopardy of being traded off in an early stage, but I don't mind that... Bb4 after Nc3 stems from Nimzovich...} 5. Qb3 {no real option here is Bd2, dxc4, e3, Bxc3, Bxc3, Qd5, Nd2, Ne7, Nxc4, Nd7, Nbc6, f3, Bg6...} Nc6 6. a3 {maybe better e3, Nf6, Bd2, dxc4, Bxc4...} dxc4 7. Qxc4 Ba5 8. Bd2 {now, e3, Nf6, Qb5 was to be preferred...} Nf6 9. b4 Bb6 10. e3 O-O 11. Be2 {much safer is Bd3, Bxd3, Qxd3, a6, 0-0...} a6 12. O-O Ne4 13. Nxe4 Bxe4 14. a4 {another option is Bd3, Bd5, Qc2, Bxf3, gxf3...} Qf6 15. b5 Na5 {after axb5, axb5, also Na5; Ne7 is looking bad after Ne5, threatening Nd7...} 16. Qb4 {more accurate is Qc3, axb5, axb5, Qg6, Ra3...} Qg6 {holding all tensions, while ruling out Rb1...} 17. Rfc1 axb5 18. axb5 Bd5 19. Bd1 {not the best: Rc3, Nc6, Qb2, Rxa1+, Qxa1, is just equal...} Nb3 {after Bxb3, Bxf3, g3, Qh5, White gets in trouble... after Nh4, Qd3, all is solved...} 20. Rxa8 Rxa8 21. Bc2 f5 22. Nh4 Qg5 23. Bxb3 Qxh4 24. f3 {well handled by White up until now; after Bc4, Black has nothing... this is losing...} Ba5 {the move White failed to oversee: upon moving the Queen, after Bxd2, Black has always Bxe3+...} 25. Qa3 {or Qa4: not helping is Qxa5, Rxa5, Bxd5, Rxb5, Bxe6+ Kf8, d5, Rb2, Be1, Qf6...} Bxd2 26. Qxa8+ Kf7 27. Rxc7+ {best here is Bxd5, Bxe3+, Kh1, Bxc1, Bxe6+, Kxe6, Qc8+, Kd6, g3...} Kg6 28. Qa1 {not much choice left: after g3, Qh3, Qe8+, Kh6, Rc2, Bxe3+ is still the killer...} Bxe3+ 29. Kh1 Bf4 30. Qg1 {a bit tougher is Rxg7+, Kxg7, Qg1, Bxb3, g3, Bxg3, Qxg3+, Qxg3, hxg3...} Bxc7 {after Bxd5, exd5, all is over... White resigns...}
