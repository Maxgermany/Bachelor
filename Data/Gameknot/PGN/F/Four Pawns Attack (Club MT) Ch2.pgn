1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f4 O-O {The thematic opening.  Now we're on our own...} 6. Nf3 {Thus early in the MT I stayed with the standard lines.} Bg4 {A tempting idea, and this square features a great deal in Black's thinking in this opening, but here it is probably premature.  White's centre remains unattacked.} 7. Be2 {The obvious reply, but not the only.  Also possible was 7.Be3, taking advantage of the bishop's occupation of g4, prohibiting the knight from striking at the freshly developed prelate.  Also coming into consideration was 7.d5 - a thematic expansion in the centre.} e6 {Now, 7.c5 was still good...} 8. O-O {... and here 8.e5 was certainly worth a look.} Bxf3 {Possibly second-guessing that White might play h2-h3.  But he could have waited for the hit before making this capture.  8....Nc6 was called for. } 9. Bxf3 {The 'natural' recapture, yet 9.Rxf3 deserved a closer look perhaps, possibly with a view to doubling rooks on the f-file.} c6 {White was threatening 10.e5, attacking the knight and unmasking the f3-bishop's line to b7...} 10. e5 {... but it does not prevent this advance, which is still good and strong.} dxe5 11. fxe5 Nfd7 {It's either d7 or e8 for the knight!} 12. Be3 b6 {White's centre remains imposing, but resources available to combat it have become more limited.  E.g. 12...f6 (a direct strike) 13.exf6 Nxf6 14.Qd2 Na6 15.Rad1 with a powerfully centralised game.} 13. Qe2 {Clearing the way for the a1-R.} Qc7 {(?) A mistake that invites a tactical shot.} 14. Nb5 {Exploiting the pin on the line white diagonal to bring the knight to d6.} Qc8 15. Rac1 {White could have played the knight at once to d6, but this is a useful 'zwischenzug' to bring the unemployed rook onto the line of the Black Queen.} Na6 16. Nd6 {Smacking the Queen once more.  The d6-square is a fine piece of real estate for the knight.  Black is in something of a bind, now.} Qc7 17. Bg5 {Probably better was 17.Bf4.   What White has in mind involves an oversight.} h6 18. Be7 {(??) A straight-out blunder, completely overlooking a tactical shot that would have freed Black from White's toils.} Rfb8 {(?) He missed it!  Well, it wasn't that easy to see when you're under pressure from an opponent whose rating is 500 point north of your own.  Black thought he had to save the rook.  But with 18...Nxe5!! Black would have repulsed White's attack: 19.Bxf8?! Nxf3+ 20.Rxf3 Rxf8 21.Ne4 Bxd5+ and with two pawns for the exchange (B and 2P vs R) Black looks pretty good.  Or 19.dxe5 Qxe7 20.Bxc6 Rad8 21.Bb5!? Nc7 and Black has consolidated, with material level.} 19. Nxf7 {(!)  The consequence of the rook's vacating the f-file.  If now 19...Kxf7 20.Bd6 Qd8 21.Be4+ with a huge attack.  Black will have a struggle on his hands even without taking the knight.  All the same, White not only counts himself lucky not to have been punished for his mistake, but feels as though he had profited from a crime...} Rbe8 {As good as anything else...} 20. Bd6 {A terrific position for White.  Look at that centre - and what can Black do against it?} Qc8 21. Bh5 {(!) A line clearance sacrifice to bring the Queen nearer the action.} gxh5 22. Qxh5 Kh7 {Understandable, but the king stumbles into a mating net.  Probably best is 22.Rf8, but as that just hands White the exchange (rook for bishop) - at best - it can hardly have been enticing.  Now it's mate in 5.} 23. Ng5+ Kg8 24. Qf7+ {(?) A nothing check that prolongs the game by one move.  24.Qg6 was correct.} Kh8 25. Qg6 Kg8 {(?) This in turn shortens the game.  But after 25....hxg5 26.Rf7 Rg8 27.Qh5+ Bh6 28.Qxh6#} 26. Qh7# {Checkmate (1-0).  White's powerful centre facilitated the quick attack on the K-side to finish the game - just the sort of thing White hopes for with the Four Pawns Attack.}
