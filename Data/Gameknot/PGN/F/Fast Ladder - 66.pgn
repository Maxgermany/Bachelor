1. e4 {Basic opening, before I found a preference for d4, nf3, bf4} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {I think my idea was to put presure on f7 after ng5. In hind sight this is very silly, obviously my development is not stable enough to play that and play ng5 would violate a very basic opening principle.} c6 4. d4 {central development, covers e and c5, covered by rf3 and might allow for d5} d5 5. exd5 {seemed to be right move to play} cxd5 6. Bb3 {I pulled this piece back because I saw no other option. bxd5, qxd5 leaves me down a b.  This is as far as I thought, I supose I could have pushed back with nc3, it think I was still hung up on the f7 idea, which at this point has already lead to 2 bad moves.} Bg4 7. Qd3 {I think I made this move in order to cover nf3, in hind sight I should have played O-O} a6 8. Nxe5 Nf6 9. Ba4+ {Playing for a check, which looks kind of silly but put some pressure on black, more development probably would have been a wiser decision.  It did seem to pay off, putting me up a bishop} Bd7 10. Nxd7 Qe7+ 11. Ne5+ b5 12. Bb3 {falling back from b5} Nc6 13. O-O {had to do it sooner or latter, I do regret not casteling at the earlier opportunity which would have allowed me to do so with tempo} Nxe5 14. dxe5 Qxe5 15. Qf3 {I dont know what I was thinking, , I think I was worried about black pushing on my king with his queen and g4 knite, im just guessing here...I dont remember.  I just recently started to look at the last 10 moves or so before I make my move, because I was making some bad moves for the fast that I was forgetting the flow of the game.   I was playing way to many games at once and was not playing well, never again shall I play 50 at once, its just not fun} Bd6 16. g3 {this move makes absolute sense to me as Qh2++  I guess I could have played bf4, but that would have lead to qxb2  Im amazed at how litte I developed my queen side} Ne4 17. Bf4 {ummmmmmmmm, trying to sacre his queen away...} Qxb2 18. Nd2 Bxf4 19. Qxf4 O-O 20. Bxd5 {umm, forking ra8 and ne4, seemed like a good idea, either way I gain a piece and keep the tempo} Nxd2 21. Qxd2 {I see what you meant when you questioned 20.)bxd5, once again I didnt think more than one or two mvoes ahead} Rad8 22. Rfd1 {building a battery behind bd5, allowing for me to move bd5 when the battery is full and attack two areas at once, basically feeling that at this point in hte game I could sacrife the bishop with bxf2+ and still win} Qf6 23. Rab1 {taking my time to build a proper rqr battery} h6 {.} 24. Rb3 {..} Rfe8 {...} 25. Rd3 {!} Kh8 26. Bxf7 {so I may have been playing over confidently..I guess I figured..yeah I dunno} Rxd3 {...} 27. Qxd3 {....} Qxf7 {....} 28. Qd6 {....} Qxa2 {....} 29. Qc6 {...} Qa4 {....} 30. Qxe8+ {ummm} Kh7 {...} 31. Qc8 {...} b4 {I don't know why I didn't mate more efficiently....I just got lazy I guess} 32. Kg2 b3 33. Rd8 Qe4+ 34. Kh3 h5 35. cxb3 Kg6 36. Qxa6+ Kg5 37. f4+ Kf5 38. Rf8# {...well...there it is}
