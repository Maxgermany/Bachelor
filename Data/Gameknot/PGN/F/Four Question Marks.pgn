1. e4 c5 {54th GK Tournament, I'm playing black and I choose the Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {And already I'm derailed. My opening reference has 3. d3, 3. d4, and 3. Bb5 and lists the rest as inferior with little to no explanation why. So, off I go without a chart.} 4. d3 g6 {I figure going dragon, or at least dragonish, can't be bad. Where else is the DSB going to go?} 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Nd5 Bg7 {Establishing the fianchetto and defending at f6.} 7. Bg5 Bg4 {I can't help but notice that my opponent has left his pawn at b2 undefended. Seems I can find a way to get my knight off of f6, with an attack, and exposing my bishop on the long diagonal. Unfortunately, right now, 7. Nxd5 is met with 7. ... exd5 putting my knight on c6 en prise and giving white time to defend the pawn at b2. By pinning the knight at f3, I am hoping my knight can get to d4, threatening to capture on f3 or play to e6, either of which may allow for unmasking that fianchettoed bishop.} 8. h3 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 Ne5 {Threatening the queen on f3 and the bishop on c4. The plan is coming together. This position is fairly volatile, but seem relatively even with chances for both sides. But, white will play four ? moves out of his next nine moves that completely destroy his game.} 10. Nxf6+ exf6 {A wrinkle, derailing my intentions on b2, but one I can work with, since now white has to save his queen and lose his bishop on g4 to a mere pawn. I credit white's 10th move with a ?: 10. Nxf6 ?.} 11. Bb5+ Kf8 12. Qe3 fxg5 {And now black is up a full knight, for naught but the cost of the opportunity to castle.} 13. f4 gxf4 {Another oversight by white. His bishop on b5 is weak and unsupported and easily attacked. At the moment, my knight on e4 was en prise and I didn't want to trade pieces when I can win one. Fortunately, this pawn capture threatens white's queen, buying time for my next move. White must play 13. Qd2 here to save his bishop. 13. f4? deserves a single ? for losing a pawn.} 14. Qxf4 Qa5+ {White missed it, taking the pawn, earning another ? on the move 14. qxf4?.} 15. Ke2 Qxb5 {Black is now up by a bishop and a knight.} 16. Rhf1 Qxb2 {White threatens checkmate on f7 but the square is defended by the knight on e5. Even better, white cannot chase that knight away with a pawn because of the black pawn on c5.} 17. Kd2 h5 {The obvious threat here is 18. ... Bh6 skewering the white queen to her king.} 18. Rab1 Qxb1 {Apparently white missed black's latest threat. I could save my queen, say with 18. ... Qd4 or 18. ... Qxa2. But that would give white time to see the threat of 19. ... Bh6, so rather than giving white a chance get out of it with nothing won, I settle for winning just a little material and trading white's pieces down. I have to give a 4th ? to 18. Rab1?.} 19. Rxb1 Bh6 20. Qxh6+ Rxh6 {And there we go. Black is up by rook and knight and it's smooth sailing from here on. With only one rook, white has no way to build up any threats on black that cannot be easily refuted, so now it's just a matter of time.} 21. Rxb7 g5 {Threatening to promote on the kingside, but also opening room for the rook at h6. } 22. c3 Re6 {First I want to drive away white's intrusive rook in my camp.} 23. d4 Nc4+ {Even better, now I can trade it off the board.} 24. Kd3 Nb6 {The white rook is trapped.} 25. d5 Re7 {And now traded.} 26. Rxe7 Kxe7 {White's last piece is gone, time to crush his pawns.} 27. g3 Kf6 {Black's knight at b3 and pawn at c4 build a solid line from a4 to d4 that white's king cannot cross, nor can he break through with a pawn. If he tries 28. a4, then 28. ... Nxa4 29. Kc4 a6 30. Kb3 Nb6 seals up the wall again with white another pawn down. It's possible that he could break through by bringing his king around behind his pawns and supporting a pawn push to a4 and a5, but this will take long enough that white's center pawns will fall.} 28. c4 Ke5 {White is running out of moves. Now he cannot move his king or he loses the pawn at e4 or the pawn at c4. } 29. a3 a6 {Locking up the queenside.} 30. h4 g4 {Locking up the kingside.} 31. Kc3 Kxe4 {White had no move. Zugzwang. No pawn could safely move, and his king had no move that kept both the e4 and c4 pawns covered. This is the point that white timed out. I originally thought the timeout was just an unconventional resignation, but evidently it was an accident. White returned and reinstated the game. The continuation went as follows: 32. Kb3 Kd3 33. a4 Nxa4 34. Kxa4 Rb8 35. Ka5 Kxc4 36. Kxa6 Kxd5 37. Ka7 Rb1 38. Ka6 Kc6 39. Ka5 Ra1# White tried advancing his a-pawn, the only move that didn't lose material, black responded by capturing it - a sacrifice of the black knight that allowed 34. ... Rb8 trapping the white king on the a-file with no escape. Checkmate ensued just a few moves later during which time black maneuvered his king to oppose white's king and deliver mate with the rook.}
