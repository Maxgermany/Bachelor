1. e4 {Popular first move.} e5 {A normal reply.} 2. Nf3 {Threatens the pawn.} Nc6 {Protects with the knight.} 3. Bc4 {Opens up bishop early.} Nf6 {Threatens the e-pawn. Now, for the gambit.} 4. Ng5 {Someone threatens Nf7, winning queen or rook.} d5 {The only way to stop it.} 5. exd5 {Takes the pawn.} Nxd5 {Takes back.} 6. Nxf7 {Someone takes the pawn. One would think: What? But someone is smart.} Kxf7 {Takes the knight.} 7. Qf3+ {Checks the king with the queen, now the knight is vulnerable.} Ke6 {Protects the knight. A risky move. Someone else is not in a good position.} 8. Nc3 {Threatens the knight, as it is pinned to the king by the bishop.} Kd6 {?? Gets out of the pin, but this is a really bad move. Checkmate in 3.} 9. Qxd5+ {I am plus one and am about to get checkmate.} Ke7 {King moves to the only possible square.} 10. Qf7+ {I check the king again, being protected by my bishop. Now, mate in one.} Kd6 {Moves to the only possible square andâ€¦} 11. Ne4# {Checkmate! The knight checkmates the king, also blocking his escape square: c5. The queen does the rest. That is a perfect example of why NOT to protect the knight with your king when the Fried liver gambit is being played against you.}
