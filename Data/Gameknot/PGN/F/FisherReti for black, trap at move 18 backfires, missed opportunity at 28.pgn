1. e4 {Good ol' e4.} d6 {I respond with Fisher/Reti for black.} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. h3 {White recognizes the potential for an attack from Bc8.} Bg7 5. Nf3 {Pretty routine to this point.} Nbd7 6. Be2 c5 7. Bb5 a6 8. Bxd7+ {White offers a bishop in exchange for a knight.} Nxd7 9. O-O cxd4 {My notes at this point.  Looking back, I wonder why I didn't take the knight with my bishop and continue to trade pieces. 10. Nxd4 Nf6 11. Nf3 b5 12. Ng5 O-O 13. Qf3 Rb8} 10. Nxd4 Nf6 {Instead of staying aggressive, I close up the castle again.} 11. Be3 Rb8 12. a4 e5 {continuing to apply pressure} 13. Nf3 b5 14. a5 Bb7 15. Bb6 {White's bishop becomes a firmly planted thorn in my queenside.} Qd7 16. b4 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Ng5 Qc6 {At this point, somewhat obviously, I'm trying to simultaneously pressure the g2 and c2 pawns, and I'm feeling pretty good about the move.  But, after I made the move, I saw the folly in it.  In fact, I made a note to myself (as follows) of what might happen if white sees the opportunity for a counter-attack ... 19. Nxe4 Qxe4 20. Qxd6 Rc8 21. Rf-d1 Qf5 ... as bad as this is, I didn't recognize the potential for even bigger problems in move 21.} 19. Nxe4 Qxe4 20. Qxd6 Rc8 21. Bc5 Bf8 {22. Qxa6 Qc6 } 22. Qxa6 {My Dad taught me a simple rule a long time ago, never trade pieces when you're behind, unless you have a really good plan for how it's going to help you down the road.  Although this series results in an even score, I'm not sure I had a plan beyond that point.} Qc6 23. Qb6 Bxc5 {24. bxc5 Qxc5 25. Qxc5 Rxc5 26. a6 O-O 27. a7 Ra8 } 24. Qxc5 Qxc5 25. bxc5 Rxc5 {A series of trades results in an even score and pressure on c2, but white has a rook behind a pawn, which is a strong position.} 26. a6 {And he knows it.} O-O 27. a7 Ra8 {About the only thing I could do.} 28. Rfd1 {Why oh why didn't I take the c2 pawn?  We'll never know.  It seems so obvious now, but I was apparently concerned about something.} Kg7 {A wasted move.} 29. Rd7 Rc4 {30. Rb7 Ra4 31. Rxa4 bxa4 } 30. Rb7 Ra4 31. Rb1 Ra5 32. Rb1xb5 Rxb5 {33. Rxb5 Rxa7 34. Rxe5 Ra1  35. Kh2 Rc1 36. Rc5 Kf6 37. c4 Ke6 } 33. Rxb5 Rxa7 34. Rxe5 {That pawn would be crucial.} Rc7 35. Re2 Rd7 36. c3 Rd1+ {37. Kh2 Rc1 38. Re3 f5 39. f4 Kf6 40. g3 g5 41. h4 gxf4 42. gxf4 Kg6 43. Kg3 Rg1  44. Kf3 Rg4 45. c4 Rxh4 46. c5 Rh1 47. Rc3 } 37. Kh2 Rc1 38. Re3 f5 {Not sure what my plan was here, but white wisely exploits the opening to place me in check.} 39. Re7+ Kg8 {and now I'm conveniently trapped.} 40. Rc7 h5 41. c4 Kf8 {I try to go after the rook, but white evades nicely. 42. c5 Ke8 43. c6 Kd8 44. Rd7  Kc8 45. c7 Kxd7 } 42. Kg3 Ke8 43. Kf4 Kd8 44. Rc6 Rc2 45. Rxg6 Rxc4+ 46. Kxf5 {and now things are really looking grim} Rc5+ 47. Kf4 Ke7 48. Rg5 Rc2 49. Kg3 Rc3+ 50. Kh4 Rc2 51. f4 Rc4 52. Kxh5 Rxf4 53. h4 Kf6 54. g3 Rf3 55. Kh6 Ke6 56. Kg6 Rf6+ 57. Kh5 Rf3 58.
