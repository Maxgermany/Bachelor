1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 {On the principle of "I have nothing to lose, so let's at least make this game interesting"...} d5 4. fxe5 Nxe4 5. Nf3 Be7 6. d4 O-O 7. Bd3 f5 8. exf6 e.p. Bxf6 9. O-O Nc6 10. Nxe4 dxe4 11. Bxe4 Nxd4 {All "book" so far, and development for both sides is just about completed. The QB's and Q's need to move.} 12. c3 Nxf3+ 13. Bxf3 c6 14. Qxd8 Rxd8 {Barring a colossal oversight from the player ranked in the 2000's, I'm not going to *win* the game. But the simpler I can make it, the better my chance of somehow pulling out a draw...} 15. Bf4 Be6 16. a3 Bd5 17. Bxd5+ Rxd5 {Another piece vanishes, and material is still even...} 18. Rad1 Rad8 19. Rxd5 Rxd5 {And now we're down to a Bishop and Rook end game. } 20. Bc1 Kf7 21. g3 {A mistake. I need to play 21 R-K1 instead to cut off Black's King.} Ke6 22. Kg2 Kd6 23. Re1 Kc5 {I have to be careful, as Black's king has made a rapid approach to the Q side.} 24. Re4 {I try to seal the K off from my half of the board.} Rd1 {Trouble. This explains why 21 R-K1 would have been better, as Black's King would have been cut off *and* his Rook could not invade the 8th rank.} 25. Be3+ Kd5 26. Rf4 Rb1 {Attacking the weak spot.} 27. Rb4 b6 28. Kf3 c5 29. Ra4 {29 R-N5 was the correct move. My lack of endgame technique begins to show.} Rxb2 30. Rxa7 Bxc3 {Now Black has a passed Pawn.} 31. Bc1 Rb3 32. Kg2 Bd4 33. a4 Rb1 34. Bg5 Ra1 35. Rb7 {Still hoping to be able to stop Black on the Q-side.} c4 36. Bd8 Rxa4 37. Bxb6 Bxb6 38. Rxb6 {So close, but yet so far. If I hadn't lost that one Pawn, this ending would be dead even and a theoretical draw. Still, I have to fight on.} c3 39. Rb1 Kd4 40. Kf3 c2 41. Rc1 Kd3 {I just couldn't get my King over to defend in time. } 42. Re1 Rc4 43. Re3+ Kd4 44. Re4+ Kd5 {I throw in the towel. Well, given the rating difference I think I acquitted myself well.}
