1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 {in our previous game in this Ruy Lopez, I played the 'modern' 0-0; this move however was conceived in old times by Steinitz, brought again into tournament practice by Fischer...} b5 6. Bb3 Bb7 7. Nc3 {another option is a4, to release Bb3; this enforces a4, and prepares an eventual Nd5...} Bb4 8. O-O O-O {Bxc3, bxc3, d5, would have been wiser here...} 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bd2 {keeping an eye on a5 and b4...} Nxd5 {much safer would have been d6; this will cost Black control over the center...} 11. exd5 Nd4 12. Nxd4 exd4 13. Bf4 {Black should be preparing c5; after Qg4, we would force it, so we need to find other ways to get to d4...} a5 {after c5, Re1, Rc8, d6; c5, a4, however will not work at the moment... this changes al...} 14. a4 {again, a4 is the move what this variation is all about; bxa4, Rxa4, would render any attempt to deploy c7 useless due to the presence of d5, and probably lose d4...} b4 15. Qh5 d6 16. Bc4 Ba6 {trying to force a way to eliminate d5 and prevent Bb5; best is Bf6, because this will soon end up awkward...} 17. Bxa6 Rxa6 18. b3 Bf6 19. Rfe1 Re8 20. Qf5 Ra8 21. Kf1 Rxe1+ 22. Rxe1 Qc8 {another option was g6...} 23. Qe4 Qd7 24. Bc1 {a devious silent move, preparing f4: not Bb2; other moves would encourage h6...} Be5 25. f4 f5 26. Qe2 Bf6 27. h3 {at this point, the game is still fairly equal; but Black is starting to suffer a lack of play and safe moves, while White is preparing g4...} Bh4 {searching for play; this will force trading Queens, not to Blacks' advantage... much safer is Qf7 or g6...} 28. Qe6+ Qxe6 29. Rxe6 Kf7 {h5 here, would have saved a lot of trouble...} 30. g4 fxg4 {what else?} 31. hxg4 h6 {h5 was still much to be preferred, followed by Rh8...} 32. Kg2 Rd8 {much safer was g6...} 33. Kf3 {going straight for d4...} c6 34. Ke4 Rc8 {after c5, Bd2! (or even Kf3!), followed by f5, Black is running out of safe moves; also g5 is becoming a nasty threat... but this is too much; black had to play c5, g5 (stronger than even Kf3 or Bd2), Re8 or at least cxd5+, Kxd5, Rc8, Bb2, Rxc2, Bxd4, Rd2...} 35. Rxd6 cxd5+ 36. Kxd4 {certainly not Kxd5 or Rxd5, followed by Rxc2, leaving Bc1 nowhere to go; now we have Be3... also after Bf6+, Kxd5, Rxc2, we have Be3, or even the stronger Rc6!......} Rxc2 37. Be3 Bf6+ {the last resort, but not helping; best was Re2, to keep the next move from happening, and let White work it out...} 38. Kxd5 Rc3 39. Ke4 Rxb3 40. Rd5 {or Ra6: nothing can save a5 any longer...} Ra3 {this is losing; much safer would have been Rb1, to support b3...} 41. Rxa5 b3 42. Ra7+ {suddenly, Black is caught up in a mate trap; f5 being the killer here... plus: d4 is about to ruin control over the b-pawn... best is Ke8, d4, g6, to hold f5; White of course can always trade pawns via Rb7...} Ke6 {a point of no return: preparing Kd6, after f5+, but losing immediately in opposing Whites' King...} 43. Bc5 {after this move, f5 is the executioner; or Bxa3...} Rxa4+ {the only one, to prevent f5 and worse...} 44. Rxa4 b2 {after Rb4, of course all is over; but why not try?} 45. Ra7 {maybe this is why: there is no escaping f5 anymore, without loss of more material and the game... eg. Be7 (to have Kf7 after f5+), Rxe7+, Kf6, Rb7 ends all... so Black resigned...}
