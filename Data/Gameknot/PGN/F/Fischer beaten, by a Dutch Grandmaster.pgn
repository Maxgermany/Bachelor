1. e4 c6 {This game took place, during the very important 15th Chess Olympiad at Varna, 1962. This tournament must have been one of the strongest tournaments ever. As was to be expected, Russia won with big figures: with the likes of Botvinnik, Petrosian, Spassky, Keres, Geller and Tal. Yugoslavia (!) came in second, before Argentina. Fischer and the rest of America, came in fourth, out of any medals. The Netherlands - with former world champion Euwe and reigning Dutch champion Donner at the top boards - came in second to last; but there will always be this game...} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 {although being a great follower of the Sicilian, Donner is not about to take any risks against Fischer: he plays the classical line of the Caro Kann; not an approach, Bobby is very pleased with...} 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 {other options were e6, Ne5, Bh7, or Nf6, h5, Bh7...} 8. Bd3 {too agressive: h5, Bh7, Bd3, was already better...} Bxd3 9. Qxd3 e6 {calmy handled, by Donner...} 10. Bf4 Qa5+ {why not?} 11. Bd2 {after c3, Ngf6, 0-0, 0-0-0!, b4, Qb5!, Black can change the scenery...} Qc7 {a bit tougher, might be Qb6...} 12. c4 {the Fischer, we will all soon become to know: boldly and aggressive... better is Ne4, Ngf6...} Ngf6 13. Bc3 {in most variations, Black is planning 0-0-0, and release his play: still, Ne4 is best here; after Ne4, 0-0-0, 0-0-0, Nc5, White can keep some control...} a5 {trying to prevent Bb4, because Donner was planning Bd6: better Bd6, Ne4 (that will come for sure), 0-0!...} 14. O-O Bd6 15. Ne4 Nxe4 {better was 0-0, to be followed by Be7: this however, holds equality...} 16. Qxe4 O-O 17. d5 Rfe8 {safer is exd5, cxd5, Rfe8...} 18. dxc6 bxc6 19. Rad1 Bf8 {a better option was e5...} 20. Nd4 {Fischer had better in Ne5, or Rd2, or Qg4: this is a lucky break for Donner...} Ra6 21. Nf5 {Fischer trickery: best is Nc2, Nc5, Qe5, Qxe5, Bxe5, f6...} Nc5 {second best: even more equalizing was Rd8!, Nxh6, gxh6, Qg4+, Kh7!, Qe4+, Kg8, Qg4+, with nothing more than repeating checks... } 22. Qe3 Na4 23. Be5 {not the Fischer we came to know: he surely would have found Nxg7, Bxg7, Bxg7, Kxg7, c5!, threatening Qd4+ and retrieving the sacrificed piece...} Qa7 {very well played, by Donner: White has no better than Nd6, Qxe3, or Qxa7, Rxa7; with a very tiny edge...} 24. Nxh6+ {losing his patience: this piece sacrifice will turn out to be far from correct...} gxh6 25. Rd4 f5 26. Rfd1 Nc5 27. Rd4d8 Qf7 {Black makes no errors: Fischer is still a full piece behind, for only a pawn...} 28. Rxe8 {worth trying was b3, Kh7, R8d2, Ne4, and regroup...} Qxe8 29. Bd4 {a useless move...} Ne4 30. f3 {desperate...} e5 {splendid move...} 31. fxe4 exd4 32. Qg3+ Bg7 33. exf5 Qe3+ {securing a winning position, by trading the Queens: even better would have been c5!, and let White bleed out of good moves...} 34. Qxe3 dxe3 35. Rd8+ Kf7 36. Rd7+ Kf6 37. g4 Bf8 38. Kg2 Bc5 {Donner is known, for his very deep and thorough knowledge of chess endgame play: but here, he might have considered Ra8!, Kf3, h5!... after this move, he again has reached equality...} 39. Rh7 Ke5 40. Kf3 Kd4 41. Rxh6 Rb6 42. b3 a4 {suddenly, White is in deep trouble...} 43. Re6 axb3 44. axb3 Kd3 {the winning move: also works Rxb3, with roughly the same outcome, the e-pawn is unstoppable...} 45. g5 {and Fischer resigned: after Rxb3, White has no way to prevent a loss...}
