1. d4 e6 2. Bf4 Bb4+ 3. c3 Bd6 {I decided here to play similarly to the previous annotation.} 4. Bg3 Bxg3 5. hxg3 {And black repeated the scheme. } Qe7 {He black varies, but it works all the same. } 6. Qc2 {Threatening h7. } g6 {Defending and providing me with some objectives. } 7. Nd2 {Not easy to exploit, right now. So let's develop. } h5 8. Ngf3 {Black wants to expand, I have to stop it. } f5 {What a wall! Again, I struggle for a dsb. } 9. e4 {Again, I hit the center. } Nf6 {Trying to find a good move, I wanted to try...} 10. Nh2 {A similar theme to the previous game. } fxe4 11. Nxe4 Nxe4 12. Qxe4 {This allow Qg5, but in that case, Ng4! Nice, isn't it?} Qf6 {Covering g6. } 13. Bd3 {Attacking g6, but I don't want to exchange queens. } Rf8 {Well, now, if he does, he will lose two pawns, so....} 14. f3 {Ah, first I have to shield f2, of course. } d5 {I'm ready, black...} 15. Qxg6+ Qf7 {Better than QxQ. A pity black lost a tempo with d5. Rg8 and I would have had work to do. } 16. Qg5 {No queen's exchange. My queen won't be useless in this game. } Rg8 17. Qh4 {Same square, but what a difference!} Bd7 {Black can't castle!} 18. O-O-O Nc6 19. Rde1 Ne7 {Same as the previous game. But now, with my knight in h2, it is really more annoying. } 20. g4 hxg4 21. Nxg4 {The knight into the game, and the queen with squares to go. } O-O-O {But black can castle. Here, I lost my temper and blundered. } 22. Nf6 {Ne4 was the move, or go for f4, f5 at once. Not this.} Rxg2 23. Nxd7 {Well, let's see.} Kxd7 {Aha, now...} 24. Qh3 {covers f3, threats the rook, and threats Qxe6. High voltage game. } Qf4+ {Check. Ok. } 25. Kb1 {Forced. } Qd2 {Deadly, but...} 26. Qxe6+ Ke8 27. Rh8+ {Rg8, RxR#. For one tempo. }
