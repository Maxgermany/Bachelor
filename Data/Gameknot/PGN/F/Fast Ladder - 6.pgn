1. d4 d6 {I knew d4 was a standard opening move. D6 is probably not the best response but I knew e5 was what I wanted to follow with.} 2. c4 e5 {C4 is what I think is the Queens Gambit opening. I followed with e5 which I knew could result in an early exchange of the Queens and remove my ability to castle.} 3. d5 Bf5 {D5 to control e6 and c6. This also restricts development of my N on b8. Bf5 to develop a piece, establish an early threat.} 4. Nc3 Nd7 {Nc3 to develop and provide more control of the center. Nd7 to clear space on Q-side. Because of the cramped nature for my DSB, I wanted to maintain more tempo for the easier castle to obtain.} 5. e4 Bg6 {E4 to threaten blacks LSB and also establish more center control. Bg6 is the only safe spot for my LSB. The downside of not playing 4...Nf6. } 6. Nf3 Nc5 {White continues development. Nc5 to start threatening the E4 square and fight for center control.} 7. Bd3 Nf6 {White and black both move to protect/threaten the e5 square.} 8. Bg5 h6 {Bg5 to pin Nf6 to blacks queen. Erroding blacks threat on e5. Black response of Ph6 to start removing the threat.} 9. Bh4 Be7 {White maintains pin. Black breaks pin.} 10. a3 Ncxe4 {I did not understand the purpose of a3 other than protect against future perches on b4. Black moves forward with starting an exchange. } 11. Bxe4 Bxe4 12. Nxe4 Nxe4 {Black finishes the exchange and is up a pawn with solid footing.} 13. Qc2 f5 {White threatens the unprotected black N. Black refuses to relinquish his footing on e4.} 14. b4 Bxh4 {White pushes Queen side pawns. I don't see the merits of that move at this juncture. Black attempts to exchange bishops.} 15. g3 Bf6 {White does not exchange. A clear error in judgement I think. Black moves his DSB back to safety } 16. h4 Nxf2 {White further prevents g5 positioning by black. Maybe an attempt to relocate his N. Nf3 may have been a little hope chess. I was unsure of the best move. I started a bad exchange to force white to make a tactical decision. } 17. Kxf2 e4 {White Kxf2 was not the best move and denies white a castle later. Black pushes to e4 and threatens f3.} 18. Rae1 Qe7 {White pins pawn. Black breaks pin.} 19. h5 O-O {For lack of certainty black castles. Activates a rook and opens up room for both rooks to move.} 20. Re2 Rfe8 21. Re3 c6 22. Qd2 b6 23. b5 Bg5 {Black threatens rook on e3. Offers exchange.} 24. Nxg5 Qxg5 25. dxc6 f4 {Black establishes a fork on white. Very precarious position for white in my opinion.} 26. Rxe4 Qxg3+ {White moves his defense on the 3rd rank. Opens a window for black to exude massive pressure.} 27. Kf1 Qf3+ 28. Kg1 Rxe4 {Cat and mouse. Black claims rook.} 29. c7 Kh7 {I saw moves e8 and c8. E8 would've been a wasted move if white pushed to promote. Kh7 was made simply because of a lack of understanding on why the best move was truly the best move.} 30. Qxd6 {I was extremely puzzled by this.} Re1+ {White resigns.}
