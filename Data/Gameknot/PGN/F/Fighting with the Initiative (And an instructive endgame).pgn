[Opening "English (A17), Queens Indian formation"]

1. c4 {The English Opening. I admit that I have never experimented with this opening in OTB or Correspondence play so I might have been out of my element here.} Nf6 {A flexible response by Black. He can utilize many setups here.} 2. Nc3 {2. d4 could transpose to the Indian defenses after the move 1. d4. However, I wanted to avoid this} e6 3. Nf3 b6 {Black uses the Queen's Indian setup. With the exclusion of the pawn thrust, d4, this seems to be a great setup for Black} 4. g3 {Fianchettoing the Bishop, the most common response to the Queen's Indian} Bb7 5. Bg2 d5 {Staking his claim in the center. It is interesting to see that the position after Black's move gives an edge to White in practice.} 6. cxd5 Nxd5 {After 6...exd5, I was planning 7. d4. O-O is also playable} 7. O-O Be7 8. d4 {White needs to have some stake of the center.} O-O 9. e4 {? White gets too greedy in his center control! This move simply loses a pawn. 9. Qc2, possibly prepping an eventual e4 seems to be a better move in this position. For example 9...Nbd7 10. Nxd5 exd5 (10...Bxd5 11. e4 gives White center control with a tempo) 11. Rd1 and White has a small plus . For example 11... Nf6 12. Ne5 c5 13. dxc5 Bxc5 14. Nd3 and White will aim to exploit the weakness of the pawn on d5. } Nxc3 {Removing the defender of e4 and opening the line for the Bishop} 10. bxc3 Bxe4 11. Re1 {White wants to drive back the bishop away from the e4 square where it controls the b1-h7 diagonal and contests the h1-a8 diagonal, two key diagonals in the position.} Bb7 {The Bishop quietly retreats back to its previous post.} 12. Qc2 {Seizing the diagonal} Nd7 {A calm developing move but it allows a move that seems to give White the initiative. 12... h6 seems preferable here} 13. Ng5 {!? White uses the mate threat on h7 to rid Black of the bishop on b7 that obstructs White's own fianchettoed Bishop on g2.} Bxg5 {Black must take the knight on g5.} 14. Bxb7 {Now Black must move the rook} Rb8 15. Be4 {Tempting black to give himself a pawn weakness on his kingside} g6 {This move doesn't seem so bad if Black plays it correctly but I might've preferred ...h6 in the position. Also possible is 15... Bxc1 16. Bxh7+ Kh8 17. Raxc1 g6 18. Bxg6 fxg6 19. Qxg6 and the position is unclear. Black has a piece for two pawn but with an exposed king, it remains to be seen if he can dodge possible threats.} 16. Ba3 {White avoids the trade of Bishops and attacks the rook on the open a3-f8 diagonal} c5 {Black closes off the diagonal.  16... Re8 seems a bit passive from Black and allows 17. Bc6, where he has trouble untangling his pieces. My Fritz program gives an interesting variation after 16... Be7 For example: 17. Bc1 Nf6 18. Bh6 Nxe4! (18...Re8 19. Bc6 and Black is cramped) 19. Bxf8 Ng5 (Black uses the fork on f3 as a counterattack. 20. Bxe7 Nf3+ 21. Kf1 Nxe1 22. Qxg6+ (A desperado that gives White the pawn back. Also possible is 22. Bxd8 but after 22... Nxc2 23. Bxc7 Rc8 24. Rc1 Na3 25. Bf4, White's backward c-pawn is a weakness) 22...hxg6 23. Bxd8 Rxd8 24. Rxe1 and we reach a rook endgame where Black has a slight advantage but a draw is the most likely result. } 17. Rad1 {Now a potential 18. dxc5 bxc5 19. Bxc5! lurks within the position. } Qc7 {Black steps off the d-file that could be opened with the pawn capture on c5. } 18. h4 {Now White signals a possible 19.h5, breaking down the fortress on g6! Thanks to the tempo on the Bishop, black cannot play 18...h5, stifling activity on the kingside. This was a possible position I had in mind as soon as I played 13. Ng5. White now has the initative for the pawn} Bf6 {?!Now, 18...Bh6 or Be7 is called for in the position. For example, after 18...Bh6 19. h5 Nf6, it's clear that Black can consolidate his extra pawn and fend off the possible attack on his king. However, after the text move, the knight is unable to go to f6! This is a key difference.} 19. h5 {Sound the drums!} Rfe8 {?! Another misstep in the position. 19... Bg7 is needed to defend the dark squares around the Black King} 20. hxg6 hxg6 21. Bxg6 {! A correct sacrifice that gives White an enduring initiative for the rest of the game. The constant threats against the his King will drive Black onto his heels.} fxg6 {Black feels obliged to take, or else he has an exposed king for no material advantage.} 22. Qxg6+ Bg7 23. Rxe6 {Winning a pawn back and taking out the last pawn in the vicinity of the Black king. } Rxe6 24. Qxe6+ Kh8 {Notice how the knight on d7 also prevents Black from using the Queen on the 7th rank for defense. I had actually planned on 24... Kh7 25. Kg2 Nf6 26. Rh1+ Kg6, where Black seems to be able to have more adequate defense like a possible ...Rh8 or ...Qf7. On h8, Black is driven to passitivity in the corner.} 25. Kg2 Nf6 26. Rh1+ {Now the White rook swings onto the h-file} Nh7 {Forced} 27. Qg6 {? An inaccuracy in the attack! 27. Qf5 was a much better move that allowed the Queen more reign in the center and would better maintain the initative, as we'll see in a couple of moves.} Bf8 {Allows Black to use the Queen for defense on the seventh rank} 28. Bc1 {Redirecting the Bishop to gain a tempo after Bf4 and makes way for a possible Be5+, exposing the King in the corner.} Qb7+ {Black throws in a check to get rid of the possible skewer along the h2-b8 diagonal.} 29. Kg1 Qg7 {This move is why 27. Qf5 was better. After this move, White must lose a tempo moving the Queen since a Queen trade will only favor Black.} 30. Qe4 {White threatens 31. Bf4 and 32. Be5, pinning the Queen.} Bd6 {?! It seems that the move I planned, 30...Rb7, offers a better defense for Black. White cannot pick up the tempo with 31. Bf4 and after 31...Kg8, White has an advantage but Black has gotten through the storm.} 31. Bg5 {! White now threatens 32. Bf6, using the pin again. 32... Qxf6?? would lose to 33. Qxh7# and 32...Nxf6 is illegal due to the pin on the knight} Rf8 {The best move but now Black drops the exchange in order to quell the persistent threats against him} 32. Bh6 Qe7 {Forces a trade off in the position} 33. Qxe7 Bxe7 34. Bxf8 Bxf8 {My gut told me this endgame was winning. I have two passes pawns on the Kingside and a potential for a passed pawn in the center. Also, a rook is much stronger than two minor pieces in the endgame due to the fact that the minor pieces do not support each other well without the help of a rook. This move focuses on getting my king active} 35. Kg2 {White focuses} cxd4 36. cxd4 {Now White also has a passed pawn in the center} Kg7 37. Rc1 {Threatening 38. Rc7+} Bd6 38. Rc6 {This shows why a rook is just so strong compared to the minors. The Knight and King are tucked away in the corner and the rook is free to harass the Bishop until the rook wins the pawn on a7.} Bb8 39. Rc8 Bd6 40. Rd8 {Now the move 41. Rd7, winning the a7 pawn is inevitable} Be7 41. Rd7 Kf6 42. Rxa7 {White's prospects of winning have improved even more. However, it is here where I started to waver.} Ng5 43. f4 {This move is a good idea but at the wrong time. 43. Rb7 is a better alternative. 43. Rb7 Bd8 then 44. f4 is better for White than the text. If 44... Ne6, 45. Rd7 threatening d5 is strong.} Ne4 44. Kf3 {White still had the opportunity to play 44. Rb7. 44... Bd8, 45. g4! prevent Black from playing Kf5, activating his own King.} Nd6 {Now Rb7 is no longer possible. Also, Black is controlling the e4 square, which is the ideal square for my King.} 45. g4 {Still preventing Kf5} Nb5 46. Ra4 {Another misstep. I could have played 46.g5+ if 46...Kf7 then I would be able to play g6+ followed by g7 and I would win the bishop on e7 for free. If 46... Ke6 then 47. d5+ Kd6 48. Rb7 Nc7 49. g6 Bf8 50. Rxb6+ Kxd5 51. f5 and white wins easily.} Ke6 47. Ra6 {? A panic move. This loses an important pawn on d4. 47. Ke3 and White is fine.} Nxd4+ 48. Ke4 Bc5 {Now things seem murky. White still should win due to the passed pawns but it is much more difficult now.} 49. a4 Nc6 50. f5+ {Another bad move on my part. 50. g5 would be the right move. This way, I can play f5+ without being blockaded on the 5th rank by the king} Kf6 51. Ra8 {Looking to play  Kd5 without the threat of Nb4+, forking king and rook.} Ne7 52. a5 {I had planned this move but now it doesn't look as good as I previously thought it was. White now allows Black to get rid of possible attack on the weak pawn on b6.} bxa5 53. Rxa5 {I still think this endgame is winning for White but it requires precise play due to the blockade on the passed pawns. My opponent thought otherwise and offered me a few draws in the subsequent moves, which I declined.} Bb4 54. Rb5 Bd2 55. Rb6+ {Important move that drives the king from the blockade on the pawns on the kingside. } Kf7 56. Ke5 {Looking to advance my king} Bc3+ {Black denies this possibility} 57. Ke4 Bd2 {Time to try another idea...} 58. Rd6 Bc1 {Black's Bishop must stay on the blockade at g5 or else White is having a much easier time than the current position.} 59. Rd1 Bg5 60. Ke5 {Trying the king advance again.} Nc6+ 61. Kd6 {I was skeptical of bringing my king away from the pawns but I could not find any immediate consequences of the King's journey. However, I think it might've been best to try another route. } Ne7 {Black's knight returns to its previous post. It too cannot stray away from the White Pawns} 62. Re1 {Possible looking to play Re6} Bf4+ 63. Kd7 {?? A huge mistake that allows an easy draw} Bg5 {? 63... Nxf5! leads to an easy draw after 64. gxf5 Kf6} 64. Re6 {However, White achieves an ideal post for the rook and now prevents ...Nxf5, simplifying to a draw.} Bf6 65. Kd6 {Now White is on top again} Bg5 66. Ke5 {White's King now achieves the ideal post on e5 and now he cannot be checked by the Dark-Squared Bishop.} Bh4 {Black is just shuffling with his Bishop. Ng8 seems like an interesting try to hold the position.} 67. Rh6 {White continues to harrass the Bishop.} Bg5 68. Rh5 {68. Rh7+ driving the King to the 8th rank seems preferable } Bc1 69. g5 {White achieves the much needed pawn advance and now I had no doubt that I had a won position now.} Ng6+ {Black tries to lure White into a swindle.} 70. Ke4 {Of course not 70. fxg6+?? Kxg6! where White loses the g-pawn and the win with it.} Kg7 71. f6+ {Clearing the f5 square for my King.} Kf7 72. Kf5 {Now threatening 73. Rh7+} Ne7+ {Black goes for the pawn for knight trade, hoping to be able to blockade or win the pawn on g5.} 73. fxe7 Kxe7 74. Rh7+ Kf8 75. g6 {Looking back on this game, 75. Kg6 gives me an easier win after I get my King to h7 to support the g-pawn's advance. Indeed, the tablebase notes that g6 takes the most amount of moves for me to win the game} Bb2 {Now Black sets up a blockade along the long diagonal to prevent the pawn from reaching g7} 76. Rb7 Bg7 77. Rb8+ {I throw in some checks before I determine what plan of attack I want to use.} Ke7 78. Rb7+ Kf8 79. Rf7+ {79. Kg5 is a much easier win. The point of this move is that if the Bishop moves away from it's post on g7, it allows White's king to go to h6 on its way to h7 to force the pawn through. Now I went from a win in 12 to a win in 24.} Kg8 80. Kg5 {At this point I hit an analysis block on how to proceed. I became worried that I wouldn't find the way to win. However, the more I looked at the position, I had an epiphany to find the way to win. It revolved around exploiting the awkward position of the Black King. I knew if I could get my King to g6, the constant threat of mate along the back rank would force Black to block with his bishop, and I could make a quiet move to force zugzwang.} Bb2 81. Rb7 Bc3 82. g7 {! The way to win} Kh7 {82... Bxg7?? 83. Kg6! and Black's best is after 83... Be5 ( 83... Bf8 84. Rb8 and Black is about to be mated. 83...Kf8 84. Rb8+ just loses the bishop) 84. Re7 Bd6 85. Re8+ Bf8 but 86. Rd8! is Zugzwang)} 83. Kf5 Ba1 {83...Bxg7 is still unplayable after 84. Kg5! and Black cannot prevent the White King from making it to the g6 square.} 84. Rb1 {Now White uses the vulnerability of the Bishop to get his rook to support the g-pawn} Bc3 85. Rg1 Bxg7 {If 85... Kg8, 86. Kg6 is the winner again. 86... Bxg7 87. Rc1! and Black cannot avoid losing after 88. Rc8+} 86. Rh1+ {Now Black is forced back!} Kg8 {86... Bh6 87. Kf6 and it's a similar zugzwang! Black must step back and lose the bishop. } 87. Kg6 {White's King makes its grand enterance to the g6 square} Kf8 {If the Bishop moves  like after 87... Bd4 88. Rd1 Bb6 89. Rb1 Bc7 90. Rc1, the rook cannot be prevented from the 8th rank any further.} 88. Rf1+ {White cannot allow the Bishop to move out of g7 or else the win is lost.} Kg8 89. Rc1 {The rook cannot be deterred from the 8th rank!} Bf8 90. Rc8 {Black is mated after 90... Kh8 91. Rh8#  All in all, I felt like this was one of the more interesting games I have ever played. I used the initiative as compensation for my early material deficit and obtained a winning endgame, which I proceeded to falter from until the end, where precise calculation was needed.
