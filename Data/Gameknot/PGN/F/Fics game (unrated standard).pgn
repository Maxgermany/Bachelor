1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 Nc6 {Blocking the c pawn} 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. Be3 {Overprotecting d4} Nge7 7. Bd3 {Planning to exchange the knight after ... Nf5} Nf5 8. Bxf5 exf5 9. a3 Be7 {Losing a pawn, so ... Bxc3+ is probably better} 10. Nxd5 Be6 11. Nf4 {Refusing the bishop!} Qd7 12. Qd3 O-O-O 13. Nxe6 {Exchanging the well-placed knight is questionable, because it allows black to fix his pawn formation, and prevents me from attacking the f5 pawn. Perhaps h4, to secure the knight} fxe6 14. O-O-O g5 {Sacrificing a second pawn to try to undermine d4} 15. Nxg5 Bxg5 16. Bxg5 Rde8 17. Bf6 Rhg8 18. g3 Qd5 19. c4 Qa5 20. d5 {This advance should have been prepared with f4, because losing the e5 pawn for the f5 pawn isn't a fair trade.} exd5 21. cxd5 Nxe5 22. Qxf5+ Kb8 {?? - Nd7 would save the piece} 23. Bxe5 Rgf8 24. Qh5 Rec8 {Not  24. ... Rxf2 25. Qxe8#} 25. f4 {Securing the bishop} Ka8 26. Rd4 {Playing for Rb4 and Qf3, then d5-d6} c5 27. Rc4 {Trying to provoke b5, because....} Qb5 {... If black played 27. ... b5, 28. Qf3 bxc4 ?? 29. d6+ Kb8 30. d7+ Rc7 31. Rd1 and white wins} 28. Qe2 Rcd8 29. Rd1 {Bringing the rook into the game} Rfe8 30. Qc2 Qd7 {... b6 seems more logical, but then black would be weak on the long diagonal after Qg2. Plus black probably had the next move in mind.} 31. Rxc5 Rdc8 {The pin looks nasty (and Rxc8 Rxc8 would be a big mistake), but my advanced pawn and Bishop are strong. And black's king is a lot worse than mine.} 32. Rc7 Rxc7 33. Qxc7 Rc8 34. d6 {A fun move to play} Rxc7+ 35. dxc7 Qc6+ 36. Kb1 {After 36. .... Qe4+ 37. Ka1, black is out of checks and with no defence to Rd8, mating or queening the pawn. A good game}
