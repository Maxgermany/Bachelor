Nf3 {Black cannot play Bg4 and pin the knight .} g6 7. Ng5 {? Too early ?  I played this to that black plays e6 /e5 . e6 blocks the light Bishop and e5 leaves black with backward d pawn} e6 8. d4 {I almost always try to put pawns on c3,d4  to defend against the fiancheto bishop} Bg7 9. c3 O-O 10. Be3 {I dont know a good place for the Bishop . But played thios so that I can play Nbd2 without blocking the Bishop} Bd7 11.

Qf3 {At this point I wanted to Play Qf1 and drive the black queen away.. Later I decided to try to contain the the Black Queen rather than drive it away } Rb6 {The b2 pawn ...Can Black get more forces to atack on this  I had to chose between Rb1 and Ra2. On Rb1 , black may play Qf5 ? and Ra2 supports the a4 pawn as well and if given a chance the rook can go to a7 } 23. Ra2 Rb3 {Black intends to double up . at this stage I thought black cannot double up since I have the a4 pawn ( I was wrong )} 24. Qe2 {change of plans -- instead of playing Qf1 I played Qe2 since I was afraid of Qf5 and Qc2 or Qb1} Rc8 {black has to protect that } 25. g4 {containing the black queen .. will follow up with Rg1 and Rg2 or Rg3} Rd8 {Black is threatening   26 ...Bxd4  27 Bxd4 Rxd4  and I cannot take with my pawn } 26.
