1. d4 {Deciding to "start off slowly" my first game against the Computers was against a battered old handheld chess device, called "Star Chess", which is still going strong after 28 years. I had decided to play ALL the chess computers/programs I could find, and I could certainly find this one, albeit at the back of an old cupboard covered in dust. Let's see how our veteran handheld chess computer fares. Will it prove a worthy representative of the Computers?} Nf6 {Star Chess plays the line which could go into many main line Queen Pawn openings, such as the Nimzo-Indian, the Gruenfeld or the King's Indian, or even transposing back into Classical Queen's Gambit Declined.} 2. c4 {I choose the most common move in this situation.} g6 {This could go into either King's Indian Defence or Gruenfeld Defence. Anyway, White's main line third move is the same for both.} 3. Nc3 Bg7 {Ah! Star Chess has opted for the King's Indian Defence! I am inexperienced with the lines of the King's Indian but I know how to play it in principle...} 4. e4 O-O 5. f4 {I choose the Four Pawns Attack (I wonder how it got that name...). My c- d- e- and f-pawns have amazing control over the centre, backed up by the knight on c3. I hope to develop more pieces quickly to keep hold on my excellent pawn structure.} Nc6 6. d5 {Developing pieces can wait. As usual, I am anxious to push central pawns unchallenged into my opponent's territory.} Nb4 7. e5 {I am controlling more and more space, while Black is being pushed back and strangled out of space. Look at that immensely powerful pawn centre! Plus, I have excellent scope for shoving Black's queenside knight around.} Nh5 8. g4 {A blunder by Star Chess...I think. His kingside knight is now trapped.} d6 {Well, my brilliant pawn formation wasn't going to last forever. But I have already fulfilled the goal of getting a positional advantage - to convert it into a material advantage.} 9. gxh5 dxe5 10. hxg6 fxg6 11. Nge2 {The best way I could see of defending my isolated f-pawn from my opponent's e-pawn and his rampaging rook on the half-open f-file. But I have some consolation for my now fragmented pawn structure. My opponent's e-pawns are doubled AND isolated. Maybe they can be picked off in the future...} Bf5 {Sneaky! Star Chess has created a tactical threat! ...Nc2  wins rook for knight, and the only defence I can see is:} 12. Kf2 {This. Not an ideal occurrence, having to lose castling rights AND bring my king forward into the danger, but it would have been pointless castling on the exposed kingside anyway and I could only have castled on my queenside when the annoying enemy knight and enemy light-squared bishop had been beaten off.} Bc2 13. Qd2 {Nasty! If 13.Qe1, then 13...Nd3  forking my king and rook.} Nd3+ {Star Chess goes ahead with Nd3  anyway.} 14. Kf3 Nb4 15. a3 {Aha! This should put a spoke in my opponent's wheel! How does Star Chess save both the bishop and the knight? A red light on the side of Star Chess started blinking madly.} e4+ 16. Ke3 Bxc3 17. Qxc3 {In-between-moves, or zwischenzugn. Perhaps my silicon opponent thinks I will forget about my own threat in the space of two moves. Not likely.} Nxd5+ 18. cxd5 Bd3 19. Qd4 {Saving the d-pawn, which like so much of my pawn-structure has become isolated. But am ahead by knight and bishop to two pawns so this does not matter much to me.} Qd6 20. b4 a5 21. Bb2 {A checkmating threat, just to liven the game up. My queen and bishop drive an attack line deep into Black's king's position. The red light went into overdrive again.} Qf6 22. Qxf6 exf6 {OK then. An exchange suits me fine, being ahead on material.} 23. Ng3 {Now for an unknown reason my opponent goes into exchange-mania.} axb4 24. axb4 Rxa1 25. Bxa1 Bxf1 26. Rxf1 {Star Chess played these exchanges really quickly, so quickly that I started worrying. "Have my opponent's crafty little silicon chips found a forced checkmate?" I wondered to myself, "Well, I haven't, so I'll just recapture and hope for the best," I resolved.} f5 27. Be5 Rd8 28. Kd4 Rd7 29. Ra1 b6 {It's time to win an unequal endgame biased in White's favour.} 30. Kc4 {I had my eye on Ra7, but after 30.Ra7? c5  wins my rook, so I had to move my king first.} e3 {Nothing to worry about. I can always sacrifice my knight if need be. The great thing about having a substantial material advantage in the endgame is that you can always sacrifice it without becoming behind.} 31. Ra7 b5+ 32. Kxb5 Rxd5+ 33. Kc6 Rd2 34. Kxc7 Rxh2 {I paused to think, and calculated that if he took the time to take my knight with his rook, I would win the pawn race by miles.} 35. b5 e2 36. Nxe2 Rxe2 37. b6 Rd2 38. b7 Rc2+ {Playing for time.} 39. Kd7 Rd2+ 40. Ke7 Rd7+ {Star Chess' little silicon chips had obviously gone into "make the game last as long as possible mode.} 41. Kxd7 Kf7 {The beauty of this position is that my bishop traps Black's king on his kingside, allowing a forced checkmate. I don't even need to chase Black's king around the board with a queen and rook first.} 42. b8=Q h6 43. Kd6# {Checkmate with a king - or at least a king move. Can you get more stylish than that? Star Chess emitted a tiny beep that could have been the equivalent of a sigh as the little red light on the side switched off. The silicon chips went to sleep...for today.  So, the score is 1 to fatcat2, 0 to the Computers. The next round will be coming soon! }
