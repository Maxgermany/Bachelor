1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 Bg4 {One of seldom seen answers. It has a little disadvantage if black wants to keep the bishop. } 4. Nbd2 {In my scheme, this N has to go there and later in the kingside, so this is the logical move. } e6 {Good, since it opens the way for the dsb. The counterside is that it seals the fate of Bg4. } 5. h3 {I start harassing the B. I'm not worried about Nb5 because I plan to play c3 anyway. } Bh5 {Black has to think twice before playing this. He will be tied into preserving the B. It's playable, but you do must know exactly where and when give it away for a WN.} 6. g4 {I'm obviously not planning to castle kingside!} Bg6 7. Ne5 {This is to 1) support g4 (I want to play h5) and 2) to prevent h6 (NxB, fxN should follow, weakening black's kingside). } c5 {This is very good for black, he has to seek for countergame. h6 is not possible now. Nc6, of course, threats to exchange the N so to avoid my previous threats. I would have answered with Nd2-f3 so to keep a N in e5 } 8. e3 {? This is bad, because now black can play Qb6 and press both b2 and d4. Nb3 defends both, but it doesn't work because of c4, kicking th} cxd4 {My opponnent didn't see it! Easier for me. } 9. exd4 {This also gives space to my dsb. } Nc6 10. c3 {This way I can breath. I must play this move instead of Nd2-f3 because otherwise Nb4 would be strong for black. I would be forced to play BxN (to avoid threats on c2 and d3) and with axN black would have opened the column for his R, which I don't like. } Nxe5 {Now a N can't go to e5, but the pawn will do it. } 11. dxe5 {The standard answer (to me). Playing the B there seems logical, but since black can play Bd6, it has little point. This way, black hasn't solved his developement problems yet. Of course, I want to avoid d4, and if Ne4 I will exchange, if needed closing the white diagonal with f3. } Nd7 {Passive move by black, but avoiding complications and pawn's scrambling. } 12. h4 {...and condeding me a tempo to carry on with my plan. The obvious threat is to trap the B. Black, curiousely, didn't want to play a6. } f6 {This is interesting, countering my B trapping with another threat (Nxe4)} 13. Nf3 {I didn't like to exchange on f6, freeing his Q and the other piece, and I am not ready to take advantage of Qh5+, so I better defend. From this square, the WN can go to d4, threatening e6, which would be a good way of further tie down black. } fxe5 14. Nxe5 Nxe5 15. Bxe5 {Another "intermediate" sequence has been added to the lsb's threat, and now I do have a strong bishop in the center. After Bd6 by black, I'll play Qd4, and my Q can't be easily chased away. } Qb6 {Very good again, even if it was late. Pressure on b2 is one of black's strong points in this scheme. } 16. Qd2 {Qb3 was possible, but if black wants to exchange, the game becomes very boring. Of couse, this move has the counterside of releasing the dsb's trap (since f3 is not supported anymore). To preserve this, Qe2 was preferable (with Qb5 as a resource to ensure the Q's exchange if any danger arises). But it would have blinded my lsb. I will allow black's lsb to dare to go to e4 in order to have a free way to g5 or f4, pressing g7. I can't say this is better or worse. } Be4 17. Rh3 {This was the move I had in mind when allowing the B to take such a good outpost. Now my trap will work (black will not lose it, of course, it will end with the B on f7, which is the place where it could and probably should have gone for a solid game. Unless I play g5 first). } h5 {! Another very intelligent move by black. hxg is threatened, with threat on the R, which will have to go on e3. I don't want to play gxh because it allows Bf5, threatening my R (and making my trap useless), nor g5, which blocks my hoped Qg5 move. } 18. Be2 {...this does preserve the trap, because if hxg, Bxg4, and then black has one move to prevent f3, (Bf5, BxB, e6xB and Qxd5 will be very strong for white). Black will have to retreat his B to g6 which, again, is not deadly bad, but after Qg5 the B has to be defended again. } Bc5 {Black plays his pieces. He is offering now g7 but Bxf2+ would be check. I thought that my Q was dead while she was dued to the defence of b1, and Rh2 would have been admitting my previous one was wrong. } 19. O-O-O {Black can take the pawn, but I could have standed the danger over my king. For example...} Bxf2 {Black greedily takes. My plan was this one: } 20. Bb5+ {If QxB, QxB, then QxBf2 was good enough, but black missed it. } Ke7 {? Wanting to connect the rooks, but allowing...} 21. Qg5+ Kf8 22. Qxg7# {A pretty unexpected end for a short but interesting game. I hope you enjoyed. }
