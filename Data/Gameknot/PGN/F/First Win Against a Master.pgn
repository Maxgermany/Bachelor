1. d4 {My standard opening.  } Nf6 { } 2. c4 { } e6 { } 3. Nc3 { } Bb4 { } 4. f3 {This is a favorite of mine that I prepared for the Nimzo-Indian. The main idea is that the pawn on f3 supports an e4 push and an eventual g4 push to attack the king-side. The obvious drawback to this is that the g1 knight doesn't get to go to its natural square, but I can still route it to g3 via e2.  } d5 {Common theme to discourage e4.  } 5. a3 {Forcing the bishop to make a choice.  } Bxc3+ { } 6. bxc3 { } O-O { } 7. cxd5 {Undoubling the pawns and preparing the development of my LSB.  } exd5 { } 8. e3 { } c5 {All main line so far. White's path of development is clear; Bd3, Ne2, O-O, and then prepare the king-side attack. Black's counter play will be focused on attacking the queen side as well as the center.  } 9. Bd3 { } Nc6 { } 10. Ne2 { } Re8 { } 11. O-O { } b6 {Slightly unusual, but it makes sense. Black wants to push a5 and exchange bishops with Ba6.  } 12. g4 {Starting the attack. White now has the plan of playing knight to g3 and then pushing g5 if possible.  } h6 {A logical move that prevents g5 for the moment, though the pawn on h6 can become a target later on.  } 13. Ng3 { } Qc7 {Interesting idea. This stops white from playing h4, which would be a good attempt to break up the pawns around the king.  } 14. Ra2 {During the game I did not see a great way to immediately proceed with my attack. So I lifted the rook with intentions of swinging it over the g2 and bringing another piece into the fight.  } a5 {Continuing the plan of putting the bishop on a6 and removing an attacker of the king side.  } 15. Rg2 { } Ba6 { } 16. Nf5 {Perhaps Bxa6 first was better. But this move still puts pressure on black, with the clear idea of playing g5 and ripping open the position.  } Ne7 {A good way to defend, as if I play g5 now black will simply take the knight.  } 17. Bxa6 {Relieving the tension. } Rxa6 { } 18. Qd3 {!? h4 was probably better. My hope was that I would invoke c4, which would close down the queen side and make attacking the king easier. } c4 {I don't know about this move, it just makes things much simpler for me.  } 19. Qc2 { } Nxf5 {? This is a strategic mistake. This allows me to open up the g-file too easily. But to be fair the pressure was starting to mount on the king side, and perhaps my opponent believed that exchanging pieces would relieve some of that pressure. A better alternative would have b5.   } 20. gxf5 { } Kh8 {Avoiding any tactics of Bxh6 after e4.  } 21. Kh1 {I do similar to prepare a doubling of the rooks followed by a difficult assault to stop.  } Qc6 {Nice move, keeping an eye on a4 if my queen was to move and also preventing any ideas of e4.  } 22. Rfg1 { } Rg8 { } 23. Rg2g3 {Giving a space for my queen to join the action. Note that Nh5 is not a threat as Rh3 would kick the knight right back to where it was and there could be some nasty tactics on h6.  } Qe8 {Brought back to defend g7.  } 24. Qg2 { } Qf8 {This game is now clearly won. All I had to do now was push e4 followed by an unstoppable e5, and black would be completely busted.  } 25. Qh3 {?! Waste of time. I was getting too overworked over tactics on h6, but there really weren't any there.  } b5 { } 26. Qg2 {Admitting that I had made a mistake, I calmly went back to push e4. The good news about this position is that I can take my time and be patient.  } Rb6 {A last attempt to try and make something happen on the queen side, but it is too late now.  } 27. e4 {Should have been done 2 moves ago.  } Rb8 {There was probably a stronger way to defend, but in time trouble my opponent could find nothing better.  } 28. e5 { } Nh7 { } 29. Qh3 {Now this move makes sense as white is threatening Bxh6.  } Qe7 {Stopping Bxh6, but allows the break-through. } 30. f6 {Upon post game analysis I found that 30. Rxg7! Rxg7 31. Rxg7 Kxg7 32. Bxh6+! was a more forcing victory. But this move still gets the job done, forcing gxf6 after which my bishop can finally get in on the action.  } gxf6 { } 31. Bxh6 { } Rxg3 {Rg6 would have delayed the ending slightly longer, but it would still end up in an easily winning endgame after 31...Rxg6 32. fxg6 Rxg6 33. Rg8 Rxg8+ 34. Kxg8 Qg4+ 35. Kf7 e6+! 36. Qxe6 Qg7+ 37. Ke8 Qh8+ and I will win the knight. But now there is no way to stop mate.  } 32. Qxg3 { } Ng5 {Black resigned in light of the fact that I could either pick up the knight (or the rook) with exf6 or force mate after Qh4, either way is winning.  }
