1. d4 {Black played Kamikaze chess... he pushed and pushed and kept pushing his pawns attacking my pieces like a madman, but then he over extended his pawns and underdeveloped his pieces, when finally he found himself without an attack objective, he lost initiative and then the game. This is a good example were lack of development get's you in trouble, attack with one or two pieces is just a bunch of fireworks that eventually burn off to nothing...} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 c5 4. Nf3 cxd4 5. Nxd4 d5 6. Bg2 {developing  because if dxc4 black only temporarily wins a pawn} e5 {black is developing several pawns with tempo, I'll let him overextend them and then try to undermine those overextended pawns} 7. Nb3 d4 8. f4 {profiting from the lack of support on a possible e4 push, that loses the d pawn, I immediately return the sharpness... I expect to see the standard Bb4+ reply} Bb4+ {yes as expected} 9. Bd2 {forced eventually, black will exchange the dark squared bishops } Ng4 {Ng4-e3 should be the idea again against best opening practices black will neglect development and uses only his two developed pieces... it will cost him eventually latter} 10. O-O {to remove my king from the center and add another defender to f4} Bxd2 {and black exchanges one of his two developed pieces} 11. Qxd2 {two ideas here further support to f4 and maybe even play Qb4 to prevent black's short castle and threaten b7} Ne3 {the third move from the same knight (?)} 12. Rf2 {forced} Nxc4 {and the fourth move now after Qb4 I sense he will not doubt about a 5th move from the knight... it must be tired, the pawn is not a definitive capture as b7 will be hard  to defend, and black as several other weak point in his camp now that several of his pawns are exposed to an attack} 13. Qb4 {here it is as planed Qb4 with tempo attacks the knight and and b7 I expect to see Qc7 N1d2 Nxd2 Nxd2 with advantage for white as black can't castle and is underdeveloped} Qc7 {forced} 14. Nb1d2 Ne3 {surprised me but is worst than Nxd2, due to Rc1 with tempo, hitting the queen, now white is clearly better and can try to convert the position and development advantage...} 15. Rc1 {occupies the open column with tempo, now black needs to move his queen away or to block the threat} Nc6 {... he chooses to block} 16. Bxc6+ {as my bishop is probably lost, I do it on my terms... disturbing black's pawn structure} bxc6 17. Ne4 {further centralizing the knight and threatening Ng5-f7 or Nd6-f7... let's see how does black deals with it} Nd5 {he really likes moving this knight aground...} 18. Qc5 Ne7 {black "re-positions" his knight with tempo, maybe to be able to castle as it blocks the queen threat on f8, but this seams to passive...} 19. Nd6+ {forces the king to remain in the center un-castled} Kf8 20. fxe5 {opening another offensive column for my last rook to enter the attack, now black is lost... he has several threats against his pawns and his pieces are either not developed or uncoordinated, so he is bound to lose material} Be6 {?} 21. Nxf7 {! wins me a pawn, if Bxf7 then e6 wins the bishop, for the knight and I'm still up a pawn... else he will lose a quality}
