[Opening "Sicilian (B92), Najdorf, Opovcensky variation"]

1. e4 {This is one of the games where I think I played reasonably well. I began with 1. e4 instead of 1. d4 which I usually play.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Sicialian Najdorf. I play this opening also as Black.} 6. Be2 {I usually play this variation, because it feels to me like the most natural place to put the bishop.} e5 7. Nb3 Be7 8. Be3 {8. O-O is the most common move, but I don't think it makes a big difference.} Be6 9. O-O O-O 10. a4 {10. Qd2 is another alternative. But I want to prevent Black from playing b5.} Nbd7 11. f4 {This is an aggressive move. Again 11. Qd2 is more often seen on the board.} Rc8 {This is a natural response that puts the rook on the open file.} 12. Qe1 {This has not been seen in grandmaster games. My plan is to transfer the queen to the king side.} Ng4 {And Black reacts immediately by threatening the bishop. This was not possible with the queen on d1.} 13. Bd2 {I want to keep my bishop.} Qb6+ {And Black takes control of the weakened g1-a7 diagonal. Although the Qb6-Ng4 setup looks dangerous, it is not enough to create serious troubles for the king. Perhaps Black is little better here.} 14. Kh1 Ndf6 {Black brings the knight to a more active square. The drawback is that the retreat square of the g4-knight is now occupied. I think this is a positional mistake that allows me to make progress.} 15. a5 {The queen does not have any good squares on the g1-a7 diagonal. Either it has to give up the diagonal or go to a7.} Qa7 {And it goes to a7. This is probably the best alternative.} 16. Bd3 {I was thinking about 16. f5 which was probably objectively best, but for some reason I began to envision an attack where the bishop belonged to d3.} d5 {And Black just allows me to make my dreams true. Black could give his knight a good square by 16...exf4 17. Bxf4 Ne5.} 17. exd5 Nxd5 18. Nxd5 {Another good move was 18. f5 with a complicated position.} Bxd5 19. fxe5 {But I preferred to keep it simple and just take the pawn. } Bxb3 {This makes Blacks position even worse. He exchanges a perfectly good and active bishop for a knight that does not do much. Doubling the pawns is not an issue here, because the activity of the bishop pair more than compensates for the stratural weakness.} 20. cxb3 Bc5 {Black continues to play on the g1-a7 diagonal. However, the threat of Nf2+ does not scare me as I can always sacrifice an exchange and there are no more threats on the king.} 21. Qh4 {Or 21. Qe4. And Black resigns. Why? For example 21...Nf2+ 22. Rxf2! And Black cannot take back because of the checkmate on h7. Or 21...f5 22. exf6 e.p. Nxf6 (22...g6 23. Qxg4) 23. Rxf6! Rxf6 24. Qxh7+ with a decisive attack. Or 21...g6 and simply 22. Qxg4. Or 21...Nh6 22. Bxh6 gxh6 23. Qg4+ Kh8 24. Qf5 and 25. Qxh7#. There is no defence.}
