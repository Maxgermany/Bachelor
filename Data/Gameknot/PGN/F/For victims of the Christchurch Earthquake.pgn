1. e4 e6 {French Defense} 2. b3 {my opponent is looking to fianchetto early} Nf6 {developing move that attacks my opponent's center pawn} 3. Nc3 {guards pawn} b6 {looking to fianchetto and attack his e-pawn again} 4. Bb2 {completes fianchetto} Bb7 {I fianchetto as well and also attack the e-pawn again} 5. d3 {guards pawn} d5 {attacks pawn again} 6. e5 {aggressive. As white, I probably would have taken the pawn.} Nfd7 {attacks pawn and will help guard the c-pawn when I push it to c5 next move } 7. Nf3 {guards the pawn} c5 {expanding queenside} 8. Be2 {As white, I might have tried a3 and followed up with b4 in hopes of trading or possibly making the c5 pawn move. With the c5 pawn gone or moved, white gain play d4 and lock the center up more.} Nc6 {attacks e5 pawn again and prevents the immediate advances of white's b or d pawns} 9. Nb5 {adds two defenders to the d4 square if white wishes to push the d-pawn but my opponent is probably thinking of entrenching his knight at d6} a6 10. Na3 {I would have preferred Nd6, but my opponent seems to be wanting to play c4} b5 {taking more space on queenside and hoping to dissuade my opponent from c4} 11. O-O {seems passive} d4 {blocks bishop from guarding e-pawn so I can take it with one of my knights, keeps white's d-pawn from advancing to support e-pawn, and opens up the diagonal more for my fianchettoed bishop. If c4, I take e.p. attacking his bishop and if the bishop takes my pawn then b4 forks the knight and bishop.} 12. c3 {in my opinion a free pawn} dxc3 13. Bc1 Ndxe5 {taking the pawn before Bf4 guards it enough to prevent me from taking it} 14. Nc2 {might be trying to relocate knight to e3} Nxf3+ {trading when ahead} 15. Bxf3 Qc7 {guards bishop so knight can move} 16. a4 b4 {taking a4 would leave me with isolated doubled pawns while advancing supports b3 pawn} 17. Ne3 {looking to post knight on c4 } Be7 {developing move} 18. Nc4 Nd4 {I also have an outpost for my knight} 19. Bxb7 {somewhat forced} Qxb7 20. Bf4 {my opponent is likely wanting to do Bd6 in hopes of grabbing my c5 pawn or forking my king and queen if I take his bishop} O-O {if Bd6, I can now take the bishop without a fork happening} 21. Be3 c2 {What I think is a clever move that nets me the b3 pawn for free. The queen must move and it can not move to a square that would allow it to safely attack my c2 pawn.  Qe2-my knight takes or Qd2/Qc1 allows me to take on c3 and fork queen and rook } 22. Qh5 Nxb3 23. Ra2 Nd4 24. Bxd4 b3 {taking the bishop right away loses my c2 pawn} 25. Qg4 {trying to catch me off guard} cxd4 {taking the rook leads to Qxg7#} 26. Rb2 Rfc8 {'pinning' the knight because if it moves I queen my c-pawn} 27. Qf3 {this is a questionable move since my opponent is offering a queen trade when he is down material} Qxf3 28. gxf3 Rab8 29. Ra1 {not sure of what the point of this move is} Rxc4 {the knight was the only thing keeping my c-pawn from queening without the rook protecting it and now if he takes my rook I gain a third passed pawn} 30. dxc4 d3 {at least one pawn queens and Bf6 is also a possibility}
