1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nfd7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 c5 {? A mistake, which gives White a clear lead.} 8. Nb5 {! Pointing out that d6 is no more defended.} Nb6 9. Nd6+ Kd8 10. dxc5 {Now White is up a pawn, and Black has no compensation at all for the deficit and the bad King.} Nb6d7 11. c4 {! Opening even more the Black King position. White one is safe because Black is too behind in development to highlight it.} Na6 12. cxd5 Naxc5 13. Nf3 b6 {Now White can bring the Queen into play gaining a tempo.} 14. dxe6 Nxe6 15. Qd5 Rb8 16. f5 {Now Black is completely lost, but he will set up a quite funny try.} Nf6 {!? It is obviously a blunder, but at least he tried something.} 17. exf6 Qxf6 {?? OK, now this is too much creative...} 18. Ne4+ {Simple.}
