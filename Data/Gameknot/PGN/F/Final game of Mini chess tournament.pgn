1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 Qc7 7. O-O Nge7 {This was game of Mini chess tournament where I was hoping to get top spot. Having split points with players in second and 3rd position players my final game against 4th position player in mini tournament was must win game for me to retain first place. I was cursing myself for having led to (over analysed) variation of Sicilian defense. I was not willing to settle for a draw, hence had to play some sharp variation. But with his last move I had some thoughts. Why this move is not there in book moves of Sicilian. Every where it is Nf6. I thought for a long time and played .....} 8. Ndb5 {Very high risk move. Sacking a N on protected squire. But I had faith that people do read games database of gameknot where no one has played 9. ..... Qb6. But even with Qb6 I was willing to take risk. } axb5 9. Nxb5 Qb8 {As said earlier Qb6 is better but not fatal.} 10. Nd6+ Kd8 11. Nxf7+ {If 11. .... Kc7 then 12. Qd6+ Kb6 13. Be3+ Ka5 14. Qa3 #.} Ke8 12. Nxh8 g6 {Any other move here and I play Bh5+. Even now I had strong desire to play 13. Bh5  Bg7  ( 13..... g*h5  14. Q*h5 followed by Q*h7 saving N. One piece anyway I have to loose. ) 14. N*g6  h*g6  15. Qg5 but fails to 15. .... Kf7. & my B is stuck. I was also pondering to play Bd3 opening diagonal for Q but had no decisive attack. So decided to bring R into play. } 13. f4 Bg7 14. f5 {I was wondering if I should take his pawn first with 14 N*g3  h*g3 than just giving N for free. But I was loosing a tempo which is so critical in sharp variation. Here if 14. ... B*N  15. f6 Now N dose not have any place to move and I win a piece. e.g. 15 ... Ng8  16. f7+ winning N.} exf5 {Now king which can't be castled is more open. N again does not have any place to go. } 15. exf5 Bxh8 16. f6 Nf5 {Maybe I missed an opportunity here with 17. Qd5  B*f6 ( else Qg8 mate )18. Qg8  Ke7  19. Q*h7  Kd8 20. Q*g6 Bd4+  21. Kh1  Nfe7 22. Rf8+  Kc7  23. Bf4  Be5  24. B*e5  N*e5. Then win game with 2 pawn up. This was as - in my analysis I was worried that Q was attacked by N on move 21 and was moving my Q instead of Rf8+. Also I was worried of black having 2 N for my R as both Q were on board.} 17. Rxf5 {His N is developed. I gave up exchange for opening diagonal for white from h5 to e8. If he does take R then I simply retreat and win game on material advantage. } gxf5 18. Bh5+ Kd8 {If 18. ... Kf8?? 19. Bh6+ Kg8 20. f7 #} 19. Bg5 {How do you avoid pawn from becoming a queen now? King can not escape to c7 as Bf4+ will win queen. Also 19. ... Qa7+ 20. Kh1  Qc5  21. f7+  Kc7  22. Bh3 now pawn is unstoppable. } Qa7+ 20. Kh1 Bxf6 {Black had to give his B as 20. ... Qc5  21. f7+ Kc7  22. Bh3 winning Q} 21. Bxf6+ Kc7 {Now I was actually pawn up. Till now it was only a flamboyant attack. All that attack was only for a pawn? Well! Credit has to be given to black for defending well. But black king is on queen side and my bishops are on Kind side and his pawn structure is disturbed which was good for me. The way forward I felt was by advancing pawns. So I continued } 22. c3 {Now his B can't move R dose not have good place to move, N dose not have good place to move. and 22. ... Kb8 23. Qd6 #. So only Q and pawns can move. } Qe3 {This is a good move. I had not analysed this move. He controls e file and gives last rank threat. Also controls black squire where his king is. My plan of playing b4 followed by b5 removing N and then playing Be5+ had to be given re thinking. If my Q goes on attack then  my both B are hanging which could be fatal.} 23. Bd4 {So I decided to give up my B for his N and opening c file for R.} Nxd4 24. cxd4 b6 {Desperately trying for safety of king with some counter attack with B diagonal. } 25. Rc1+ Kd8 {Cant play 25. ... Kb8  26. Qc2  Bb7 (to save B) 27. Qc7+  Ka7  28. Bf3  Rb8  and white has a very comfortable position. } 26. Rc3 {Now if 26. ... Qf4 27. Qd1 with winning attack. He has to choose between keeping D column or black squire file of c1 to h3. He chose latter.} Qg5 {Leaving d file open, but 27. Qd2  Qg1 28. Rg3 Qe3 has reasonable defense. He is controlling black squires and if I am to give check with my Q then I need control of black squires. So I had to draw away his queen.} 27. Rg3 Qf4 {Qh3 would have been better keeping pressure on my B. But there is no direct forced mate besides last row threat he is also threatening to kill my pawn at a2. Playing a3 and h3 will waste lot of time and he has opportunity to develop. So I decided to bring my pawn in attack. } 28. d5 d6 {To stop d6. if 28. ...  Kc7  29. d6+ Q*d6  30. Rc3+. Now I don't have any winning attack but just to try my luck I played } 29. Rg8+ Kc7 {?? Blunder. He could have played 29. ... Ke7  30. Qd1+ Kf6 ( not 30. ... Qe5?? 31. Re8+). Then I would be forced to defend with h3. Balance is just formalities. } 30. Qc2+ Kb7 31. Qc6+ Ka7 32. Rg7+ Ka6 33. Qxa8+ Kb5 34. Be2+ Kc5 35. Qc6+ Kd4 36. Qc4+ Ke3 37. Rg3+ {Here he resigned as Q cant be saved. Hope you enjoyed the game.}
