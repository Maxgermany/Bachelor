[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 c5 2. f4 {it all starts with this: mainly preparing Nf3, and supporting an eventual e4-e5; we ingnore c5 as a whole...} d6 {only justifiable after Nc3: Nc6 is the best move; contest d2-d4...} 3. Nf3 e6 {also too slow...} 4. c3 {mainly against Nb8-c6-b4/d4: which is not happening at all...} d5 {normally, d5 is a winning move in the Sicilian: not here...} 5. e5 c4 6. d4 {no second thoughts: cxd3ep is not good...} Nc6 7. Be3 {an important move, in the GPA: this keeps the White King out of checks, after castling...} Be7 8. g3 {preparing Bg2...} f6 9. Bg2 Qb6 10. Qc2 {also part of the GPA: covering for b2; in some cases - against a strong Sicilian - this could lead to check on g1: but certainly not here...} Nh6 {fishing in murky waters...} 11. h3 {against Ng4: after Nf5, Bf2...} Bd7 12. O-O Rc8 {castling long, might have been an option: I don't know...} 13. Nbd2 {finishing development, and the full GPA setup: now let's play chess...} Nb4 {right: this was unexpected...} 14. cxb4 c3 {this too: Bxb4, would have been more convincing...} 15. Nb3 {I fail to see Blacks' point...} cxb2 {so does Black...} 16. Qxb2 fxe5 {of course, pawn b4 is poisonous: but this is not much better...} 17. Nxe5 {making castling short impossible...} Bb5 18. Rfc1 {taking over, the c-file...} Rd8 19. g4 {nothing special: just avoiding Blacks' last free move Nf5; however, Black resigned...}
