1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Bf5 3. e3 e6 4. Bd3 Bg6 5. Bxg6 hxg6 6. Nf3 {just my own quirky way, of handling this Queens' pawn opening: we have opened up the h-file, and we will use it...} Bd6 7. O-O {castling into trouble, as far as I see this...} f6 8. Re1 a6 {against Nb5...} 9. e4 Bb4 10. exd5 Bxc3 11. bxc3 Ne7 {pawn e6 is not the problem here...} 12. Rxe6 Kf7 13. Qe1 Re8 {the trapped White Rook: that was the real problem...} 14. Bf4 {very sloppy: but White is already in even more trouble...} Qxd5 15. Re3 {forced...} c6 {Bxb8, is in Blacks' favor...} 16. Rd1 {White has some material to spare, so why not?} Qxa2 17. c4 Qxc2 {and even more: Black has restored the material balance; but things are getting weirder...} 18. c5 Nd7 19. Rd2 Qf5 {making an issue out of the unprotected Bf4...} 20. d5 {already, Qxf4 might be a good idea: but White is oblivious; we keep it like that...} Nxd5 {at this point, it must have dawned on White: he screwed up...} 21. Rxe8 Rxe8 22. Re2 Rxe2 23. Qxe2 Nxf4 {always a delight: picking up a full piece with tempo...} 24. Qe3 Qb1+ 25. Ne1 {getting careless...} Ne5 26. g3 {air for the King: we do not think so...} Nd5 27. Qe4 {it is true, that the White Queen has not many places to go: plus that Ne1 needs to be covered; but this measure is a bit dramatically: or maybe a prosaic way to resign...} Qxe4 {so White resigned...}
