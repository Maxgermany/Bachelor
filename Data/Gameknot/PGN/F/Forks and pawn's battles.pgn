1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 h6 {Seldom played. I have many options here (Bg3, Nb-d7, e3...), but I choosed to try....} 4. h4 Nc6 {I insist c5 is better.} 5. Nbd2 {My intention is NOT to play c4, since it allows black's incursion in b4. It's an option. } Qf6 {!? First game's strike. How to save the B? } 6. e3 Bd6 {I have here the option to play BxB and go against f6. It's slow and somewhat boring. Ne5, the standard answer, is now impossible because after the exchanges the BQ retakes the last. But...} 7. Bg5 {If hxB, hxg5, threatening the queen, and winning the Rh8 the next move. Black can also concede the Q for the Ra1 and the B with RXRa1, BxQ, NxB...} Qg6 {Now the B can be taken, and Bf4 is not good because after the exchange my pawn's structure will be broken. I played "hope chess", here! :-)} 8. h5 {!?} Qf5 {...of course. Now? How to defend this? It was not easy: Bd3, Qg4, Rh4, Qxg2, Bf1, AND THE BQ is trapped! I didn't see it!} 9. g4 {I saw this: } Qxg4 10. Rh4 Qf5 {...that was even better! NOW the BQ IS trapped after Be3, but I still didn't see it! Ah, blitz...} 11. Bf4 {I just thouth I found the way to save my pawn's structure. } g5 {!? Black went on attacking and complicting the game. I could go on with Bd3, but after Qf6 I will lose the exchange with BxB, gxR, Bxc7, not terrible but not a bargain...} 12. hxg6 e.p. {Now or never. It solves the h5's weakness, too...} fxg6 {The fork is still threatened. In a blitz, this is very hard to handle. } 13. Bd3 {Why not? I couldn't find any "trick" all around. } Qf6 {The chance to trap the Q was lost forever. Now, I had to find some improvement over BxBd6, because this leaves me with a cramped position and no attack. } 14. Be5 {The N here threatens Nxg6, forking the Q (if QxR) and the Rh8. But the BQ can check me on h1, and get the tempo to play Rh7, breaking the fork. But after this...} Nxe5 15. dxe5 {...the fork is momentarily returned to black...} Bxe5 16. Nxe5 {Sacrifying the exchange, but NOT to play for the counterfork, but...} Qxh4 17. Bxg6+ {...for this. Now my Q will become active, and my minor pieces are wonderfully placed. } Ke7 {For the third time, I missed the chance to play better: Qf3 seemed to force black to play Qf6 in return, and after QxQ+, KxQ, f4, white stands confortably while black is cramped. Instead, I played...} 18. Qh5 {?! Kind of forcing the Q's exchange, being -3 in material! The good part will be I will be ahead in developement. } Qxh5 19. Bxh5 Nf6 {My opponent could have considered this a way to get out of troubles, returning the material. } 20. Ng6+ Kd6 {I thought about Nc4+, dxN, o-o-o+, but I wasn't absolutely confident of the resulting mate net.  } 21. Nxh8 Nxh5 22. O-O-O {Threatening to mobilize the N with tempo due to the pinned d5. } Bd7 {A pawn for developement, but what an important one!} 23. Nf7+ Ke7 24. Nxh6 {Whew! Now the material is 0!!! Incredible. A new game starts here. } Nf6 {My problem is to get out the N from there, and the only sensible way to to it (!) was...} 25. f3 {?! Was  I wrong? I could have played Rh1 safely, since if B played Rh8, Nf5+!, winning the exchange. But after the BK moves, and gets out of white's N checks... what?} Rh8 26. Ng4 Nxg4 27. fxg4 e5 {Of course, threatening my free pawn. It's isolated. Will I be able to keep it? If I can't, black's majority will winn, in the long run!} 28. g5 {Tensely daringly, but blocking the king's access, and putting the pawn in a different color square than Bdsb. } Kf7 {The reasoning was this: my pawn has to be supported by two minor pieces. The R, it's ok, but the other must be the N. And quickly, otherwise black will take the P. In order to accomplish that, the WN must go to e4, but now this is impossible. A move like Nf3, attacking the two pawns simultaneusly, would be answered with Bg4, losing his power. So, the only left active move was...} 29. e4 {If d4, Nf3 would be possible. If dx3, Ne4 was not a secure outpost, but could help and allow to look for something else. If...} c6 {...! My opponent is playing really well, understanding the position's intricacies! Now, if Nf3, dxe4 and I must go away... and I will lose my g only hope!} 30. Rg1 {No choice. I felt pretty lost at this point!} Kg6 {Preparing Rh5, and if Nf3, dxe4. But I saw a light in the horizon!} 31. Nf3 {This is threatening the fork! Again, our old friend and thematic motif...} Re8 {Well, good, now dxe4 is threatened, and... no, I have to look for something more. } 32. Nh4+ Kh5 {? Well, this could be the losing mistake... guess because of what? Because it leaves g6 to white? Not at all, because black can stop the pawn with Be6. So why?} 33. Nf5 {Because of this FORK THREAT on g7. Incredibly, black is not left anything better that to go back with the king, and try to shield on the 8' rank... a defensive game!} Rf8 {AAAhhh... that was better than BxN, solving the fork problem, but leaving me with two very dangerous pawns! White is making the most of his positional advantage...} 34. g6 {Be6 guarantees that the promotion will cost black only the B. Black is still unable to take a tempo to play dxe4, and it will be useless, since my K stands to guard e1. } Bxf5 {Desperation. Maybe Rg8 was indicated. } 35. exf5 Rg8 {Better, in my opinion, Kh6, but after the two pawns are joined, black is doomed!} 36. g7 Kh6 37. f6 {I will play f7, and all will be over. } Kh7 38. Kd2 {?? I missed the winning move!} Re8 {...but it's the same. Black has nothing to do. } 39. Ke3 d4+ 40. Ke4 Re6 41. f7 {...and the game is over! Good fight! My opponent was about 1300 ELO rated. I think he played well above this rating. What do you think?} Rf6 42. g8=Q+ Kh6 43. Rh1# {}
