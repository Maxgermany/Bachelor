[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {My favorite opening with White.} e5 {Starting with King's Pawn Game.} 2. Nf3 {Playing the most popular move by White in this position.} f6 {Bad move for Black. Since the e-pawn can be taken by the Knight. And if Black takes back the Knight, there will be a great counterplay by White. These four moves are known as the Damiano Defence.} 3. Nxe5 {So white takes the e-pawn.} Nh6 {Black knows about the danger and doens't take back the Knight.} 4. d4 {d4 is played to keep the line for both Bisshops open, just in case Black still wants to take the Knight.} d6 {But still, Black chooses not to take the Knight.} 5. Bxh6 {A Knight for a Knight trade, because if Black takes the Bisshop, it leads to a Mate in two.} gxh6 {Black still believed that the Knight was not a good idea to take, so he took the Bisshop. And we now know what will happen.} 6. Qh5+ {Step 1.} Ke7 {No other options.} 7. Qf7# {And step 2. Checkmate.}
