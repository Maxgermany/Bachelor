1. e4 c5 2. d4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 {the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian: I will stick to this, until I die...} 4. dxc5 {testing Blacks' bluff: probably best...} Qa5+ {forced, by now...} 5. c3 {this is surely not the best for White: still haven't figured out what is; I rarely get to play this variation with White...} Qxc5 {also forced...} 6. Bd3 e6 {following the Hungarian...} 7. O-O Ne7 8. Be3 {it has to come at some point...} Qc7 9. Qd2 {preparing Bh6: always a dead end...} O-O 10. Bh6 Nbc6 {keep on developing...} 11. Bxg7 Kxg7 12. c4 {not very impressing: but also White knows, that d7-d5 is the issue here...} d5 {so there it is...} 13. Nc3 {more to the rescue...} Rd8 {same, but more impressive...} 14. exd5 {the exchange is forced: otherwise dxc4, or even d5-d4...} exd5 15. cxd5 Nxd5 {Nb5, is met with Qa5...} 16. Nxd5 Rxd5 {creating a nasty pin...} 17. Qc3+ f6 {no sweat..} 18. Bc4 {very careless...} Rc5 {this time, the pin is costly...} 19. Qd3 {and after this, the pin becomes lethal...} Nb4 {and Black resigns: the clock remained at 4:31 for Black, and 2:34 for White; in minutes, that is...}
