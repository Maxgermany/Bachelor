[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D05)"]

1. d4 {A sound opening move from white - an other possible move would be e4.} d5 {Black plays d5 the best response to d4} 2. Nf3 {Nf3 lends support to the d pawn whilst also taking control of the e5 square. This is a strong move in the race between black and white to control the centre of the board} Nf6 {The natural reply to Nf3. Black protects the d pawn whilst gaining control of the important e4 square.} 3. e3 {e3 lends further support to the d pawn, it also controls the f4 square. This move also allows the light bishop to move.} e6 {e6 gives support to the d pawn giving the dark bishop room to move. I also gains control of the f5 square.} 4. c3 {This move gives a further defender to the d pawn controls the c4 square and also allows the queen the option to move to the queen side for a possible attack in time.} c5 {c5 is a direct challenge for control of the centre by attacking the d pawn. At the moment this is not a real threat as the d pawn is protected by 3 pieces and only attacked once.} 5. Nbd2 {Nbd2 gives a second control on the c4 square whilst also keeping a watchful eye on the e4 square}
