1. e4 c5 2. Bd3 g6 3. Ne2 {already, I was raising my eyebrows: what was he building in there?} Bg7 4. O-O e6 5. c3 Ne7 6. Bc2 {while I was just minding my own Sicilian business, White was clearly up to something; but what on Earth could it be?} O-O 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 d5 {after a somewhat peculiar start - from White, that is - I ended up on trusted terrain; Whites' approach is somewhat odd, but who am I to judge? this guy from Slovakia, is more than 200 points above me...} 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Re1 Nc6 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Qg4 {at this point, I first sensed that White was not comfortable in this opening: this early outbreak of the Queen does not look very promising; I expected Nd2, Rb8, Qg4, e5, Qg3, at least...} e5 {not too hard, to find...} 13. Qc4 {Qg3, would have made some sense: from here, White has no advantage left...} Qc7 14. Nd2 Be6 15. Ne4 Ne3 {Whites' last move, was not all that accurate: better Qh4, to avoid trouble like this; this buys Black time, to fortify...} 16. Qe2 Nxc2 {all being said and done: White had easier ways, to trade this Bishop; this costs White a lot of tempi...} 17. Qxc2 c5 18. Be3 {Black has just prevented Nc5: frustrated, Black is attacking the c5 Sicilian troublemaker; this move however, does not belong in this opening: at least not in this stage; better c4, f5, Ng5...} c4 {of course: here is my Sicilian troublemaker...} 19. Rad1 {too soon, to contest the major pieces: Whites' position is too unbalanced; better Nc5, forcing Bd5...} Bf5 {this is more troublesome...} 20. f3 {a terrible move, but probably the best one; White is losing control: now we compromise Whites' major pieces...} Rfd8 21. Rxd8+ Rxd8 22. Rd1 Rxd1+ {a judgement call: not enough is a5, Rxd8+, Qxd8, b4!, cxb3 ep, axb3, Qd5, c4, Qb7, c5...} 23. Qxd1 Qa5 {the best one: we soon need to neutralize White's pawn majority, on the Queens' side...} 24. Qd6 {careless, to say the least: best is still b4, cxb3 ep, Qxb3; now, White ends up in a series of forced decisions: and ends up, in a very early - but not winning - endgame...} Bxe4 25. fxe4 Bf8 26. Qb8 Qxa2 27. h3 {at this point, Black has already secured the draw: the unsafe position of Kg1, can do a lot of damage; the other option was Qxe5, Qb1+, Kf2, Qxb2+, Kf3, Qa1, Bd4 (threatening Qh8 mate), Qf1+, Kg3, f6, and the order is restored: not to Whites' advantage...} Qb3 {the safest way to go, and forcing Qxe5: with the (much needed) attraction of a mate attack, after Bd4; after moving the Queen, always Qxb2, and after Qxb3?, cxb3, Blacks pawns (a5 and/or f5) will soon make a winning difference; at this point, I had already settled for a draw...} 28. Qxe5 {this move came in with a draw offer, which I boldly refused: I had to try one other thing...} Qd1+ {maybe a bit too obvious, but still: after Kh2??, Bd6, White can safely give up...} 29. Kf2 {forced: into repetitive checks...} Qc2+ 30. Kg1 {an interesting line would have been Kg3, Qd3, and explore that: White chooses repetition of check or moves...} Qd1+ 31. Kf2 Qc2+ 32. Kg3 {there it is...} Qd3 33. Kf2 {another option was Qd4 - obviously blocking the lethal Bd6, via e5!; might follow Qe2, e5, a5, Qa7, Qe1+, Kh2, h5!, Bd4, g5, Qxa5, g4, hxg4, Qh4+, Kg1, Qe1+, Kh2, Qh4+, with repeating checks... this leads to the third repetition of the sequence Kf2, Qc2+; so a draw it is...} Qc2+ {drawn by rule: an excellent example - if I may say so myself -  on how to force a draw with Black; keep attacking the King...}
