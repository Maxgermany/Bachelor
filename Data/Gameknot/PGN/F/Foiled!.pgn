1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is a razor sharp game against Expert Nyctalop.  Nyctalop has kindly commented on my previous annotations so I thought I would try my luck against him.  I tried to attack but it was rebuffed big time.  The story starts with a Scilian Defense. 1. e4  c5.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - fairly standard play so far.} Nf6 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3 - it is considered bad play to play Nxc6 as bxc6 allows black to build up a pawn centre.  Mind you I did do this exchange in an OTB friendly against a player with an 1824 rating way back in 1999 and went on to win in spectacular fashion.  Sadly I did not notate that game but it is in my memory - my rating was 1240!  Still, I decided not to chance it here and play Nc3 - a developing move which defends the pawn on e4.} e5 6. Ndb5 {6. Ndb5 - I go into the Sveshnikov Variation.  This variation is razor sharp as you will soon see.} d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 {9. ...... gxf6 - black could have played Qxf6 preserving his kingside pawn structure.} 10. Nd5 f5 11. Bd3 {11. Bd3 - defends e4 with development, now I am ready to castle and I do so next move.} Be6 12. O-O Bxd5 13. exd5 Ne7 14. c3 Bg7 {14. ...... Bg7 - if Nxd5 then Bxf5.  This bishop will be very strong on that diagonal, especially when black plays b4 at a convenient moment.} 15. Qh5 {15. Qh5 - Glenda goes to h5 intending to spearhead a mating attack if black castles short.  The move also piles up on the f5 pawn.} e4 {15. ...... e4 - crosses my attack on f5 now Fou Leblanc must retreat.  He chooses c2 hitting out indirectly at h7.} 16. Bc2 O-O 17. Rae1 Qc8 {17. ...... Qc8 - very strong, putting pressure on c3.} 18. Kh1 Rb8 19. f3 b4 {19. ..... b4 - at last black plays that dreaded b4.  I take on e4 - it is the last move before we enter open play.} 20. fxe4 bxa3 {20. ...... bxa3 - the knight goes but I will get my piece back very soon.} 21. exf5 {21. exf5 - this move looks strong but black has an answer.} Re8 22. f6 Ng6 {22. ..... Ng6 - defends against all threats.  I now decided to regain my piece.  Maybe I should have traded rooks, but I leave it to you the Inquest Jury to decide!} 23. fxg7 Rxe1 24. Rxe1 axb2 {24. ...... axb2 - that pawn is gonna be a thorn from now on in.} 25. Qf3 {25. Qf3 - in retrospect maybe Bb3 immediately but then Qxc3.} Qc4 26. Bb3 Ne5 {26. ..... Ne5 - threatening no doubt Nd3.} 27. Qd1 Qxc3 28. Rf1 Rc8 {28. ..... Rc8 - I decided to wave the white flag here as I have no defense to Qc1.  There would follow something like this Variation A  29. h3 Qc1  30. Qxc1 Rxc1  31. Rxc1 bxc1=Q+   Or just a little bit worse ......  Variation B  29. Qb1 Qc1  30. Rxc1 Rxc1+  31. Qxc1 bxc1=Q+  32. Bd1 Qxd1#  Ending up a rook to the bad in Variation A.  So well played there nyctalop.}
