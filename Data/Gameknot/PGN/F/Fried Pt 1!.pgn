1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Just dug out this game on the Fried Liver attack in which I played the black pieces.  This match took place in a leisure centre in Brandon, Suffolk sometime in 1998.  I lost this game but it does throw open to debate how strong the Fried Liver Attack really is.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {3. ...... Nf6 - the Two Knights Defense - this leads to some interesting play.  Na5 is now the recommended move although it does leave black a pawn down.} 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 {5. ......... Nxd5 - it is this move that starts the Fried Liver Attack.  The formation of the black king, knight and pawn clustered on d5, e5 and e6 in the middle of the board make it look like a lump of liver in a body!} 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7. Qf3+ Ke6 {7. ...... Ke6 - Henry must go to e6 to protect his steed as black will be a pawn down otherwise.} 8. Nc3 Nce7 9. Qe4 c6 10. d4 {10. d4 - nasty, nasty, the e5 pawn is pinned by the Wicked Witch of the West on e4!} Kd7 11. Nxd5 Nxd5 12. dxe5 {12. dxe5 - white has a strong passer on e5!} Kc7 13. O-O Nb6 14. Bb3 {14. Bb3 - white does not wish his powerful lsb to be exchanged.} Bd7 15. e6 Be8 16. Bf4+ Kc8 {16. ....... Kc8 - Henry finds some shelter on c8 but my a8 rook is boxed in.} 17. Rad1 Qf6 18. Rfe1 Be7 19. Bd6 Bg6 20. Qg4 Re8 {20. ........ Re8 - I try and develop my pieces as quickly as possible.} 21. Qg3 Bf5 22. c4 Bxe6 23. Rxe6 Qxe6 {23. Qxe6 - that white pawn has been removed from the board and a rook for a bishop has been exchanged, but white's attack has not burned out!} 24. c5 Qf6 {24. ........ Qf6?? - I think here that I should have tried Bxd6 instead - if R, Q or P captures Frere Lenoir then Glenda can give a check on e1, RxQ then RxR#!} 25. Qg4+ Nd7 {25. ........ Nd7 - I don't like walking into a discovery if Kd8 so I decide to block the queen check.} 26. Be5 Qxf2+ 27. Kxf2 Bxc5+ 28. Bd4 Rf8+ 29. Kg1 Bb6 30. Bxb6 {30. Bxb6 - after blundering away my quen on move 26 trying to counterattack I decided to throw in the sponge as even though I can take the bishop on b6 white has the killer Qxd7  and I end up a Q and piece down for a rook without any counterplay.  So time to wave the white flag.  Hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now.  Joanne}
