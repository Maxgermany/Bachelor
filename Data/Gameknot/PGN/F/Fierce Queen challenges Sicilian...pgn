1. e4 {this game, was a challenge where I set out to play 1. e4 c5... this (by then 1600+) player complied, and decided to get it over with quick... this game earned me less than 10 points, risking many points with not winning...} c5 2. f4 e6 3. Nf3 d6 4. g3 Nc6 5. c3 {my personal setup against most types of the Sicilian: 1. e4 c5, 2. f4, 3. Nf3... g3 is played to maintain Bg2, c3 against Nb4/d4; Nf6 is met with e5... notice, c5 is totally ignored... this type of play systems comes from the days of Fischer and Tal, reinventing the Sicilian...} a6 6. Bg2 Nf6 7. d3 Be7 8. O-O O-O {this system for white is often referred to as the Grand Prix Attack, since it carries virtually all strong points of many systems white can choose from... black however, has to wait this out...} 9. Be3 {mainly against Qb6, followed by c4+; Ng4, Bf2, Nxf2, Rxf2...} Qc7 10. h3 {against Ng4...} Bd7 11. Nbd2 {preparing d4...} b6 12. Qc2 {this move does all kinds of things, after d4...} b5 13. d4 {now let's play chess...} c4 14. e5 Nd5 15. Bf2 h6 16. Ne4 dxe5 17. fxe5 f5 18. exf6 e.p. Nxf6 19. Nxf6+ Bxf6 20. Nd2 {white is gaining advantages, but nothing is decided yet...} Be7 21. Rfe1 Bd6 22. Ne4 Be7 23. Be3 Rad8 24. Qe2 e5 25. d5 Nb8 26. b4 Bd6 {there was no real progress, for white after Bf5, a4, bxa4, Rxa4, Bxe4, Bxe4, Qd7... this mistake changes that...} 27. Nxd6 Qxd6 28. Bc5 {here goes material...} Qf6 {making matters worse...} 29. Ref1 Qg5 30. Bxf8 Rxf8 31. Rxf8+ Kxf8 32. Rf1+ Kg8 33. Qf2 {the smoke is clearing, black is losing...} Qe7 {better Qf6...} 34. d6 {forcing the Queen back to d8/e8 or Qf6, Bd5+...} Qxd6 {this loses instantly... black loses the Kings' row...} 35. Qf7+ Kh8 36. Be4 {the killer move...} Bxh3 {the only move was Be6, Qg6, Qb6+, Kh1, hoping to confuse white somewhere...} 37. Qf8+ Qxf8 38. Rxf8# {}
