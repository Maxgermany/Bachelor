1. e4 {I always use this opening as I find it lead to a open game, which I prefer. It was also what I was taught to do at chess club.} e5 2. d4 {d4} exd4 3. Qxd4 {I always like to get my queen out early.} Nc6 4. Qa4 {Keeping pressure on the knight, but I am unsure what to do from here so recommendations please :)} Nce7 {Ne7} 5. Nf3 {Nf3} Ng6 {Having knights together in my opinion is always good.} 6. Nc3 {Nc3} Nf6 {Nf6} 7. e5 {e5} Nh5 8. Bd3 {A trade.} Nhf4 {Mistake} 9. Bxf4 Be7 {Preventing king check this is when I start my plan.} 10. Bxg6 {Since I am winning trading is a good option.} fxg6 11. Nd5 {Attacking begins} Bc5 {Trade is declined} 12. Bg5 {Bg5 is a great move as if he moves Be7 I go Be7 and the queen is lost and gooffie is down on even more material, gooffie could play Qg5 but then Nf5 resulting in -10 points. This was a swift game but I usually don't start this aggressive but it worked this time. gooffie resigns}
