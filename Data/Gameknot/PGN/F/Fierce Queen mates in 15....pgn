[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 c5 {still my favourite reply to e4: the Sicilian...} 2. Nf3 g6 3. Ne5 Bg7 4. f4 e6 {just striving for my usual setup in the Hungarion variation in the Sicilian: Ne7, ..., 0-0, ..., and play or prepare d5... best for White is probably Nc3, or exchanging the center with a direct d4...} 5. Bb5 {exotic, to say the least...} Ne7 {Black could of course consider 5. ... Bxe5, 6. fxe5 Qh4+, 7. Kf1 Qxe4, 8. Qe1 Qf4+, and grab off some pawns; but black is on a mission...} 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc4 {White realizes, that Ne5 does not really help: but this retreat is already too much...} a6 {not too hard to find...} 8. Ba4 b5 9. Nd6 bxa4 10. e5 {there was not much saving left for White: this obvious move however, makes it worse...} Bb7 {not at all bothered by the opportunity of f6!, exf6, Bxf6, c3, Qb6, Nxc8, Rxc8... or Nxb7, Qc7, Nd6, f6, exf6, Bxf6, Ne4, Bd4+...} 11. c3 {the key move, but badly planned...} Qb6 {Qc7 and Bd5 were other options; this works better for me...} 12. Kh1 {missing the point here: neccesary was Nb1-a3-c4, and drive the Black Queen away from this dangerous position...} Nf5 13. d4 {there was no redemption in Nxf5, exf5, Qxa4, d6!, d4, cxd4, cxd4, dxe5, dxe5, f6, Qc4+, Kh8...} Nxd6 14. dxc5 {a bit tougher was exd6, cxd4, cxd4, Qxd6, etcetera; this is too much...} Qc6 {no rocket science involved here...} 15. Qxd6 {I have played a lot of games of chess in my life, but I still fail to be able to explain moves like this; we are running out of questionmarks here: anyway, after the very much needed 15. Qe2 Nf5, 16. b4 axb3, 17. axb3 f6, the game is over also...} Qxg2# {mate in 15...}
