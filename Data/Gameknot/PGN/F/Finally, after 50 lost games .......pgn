1. c4 {....... a DRAW with the Master Mater!  Hi everyone!  This is my longest ever game with Master Freddy and I am pleased to say that after 50 losses I finally opened my account with the Master Mater who is not called that for nothing!  Operation Joblock finally triumphed.  Anyhow, this marathon started off with Freddy playing 1. c4 which is the English Opening.} e5 2. Qc2 {2. Qc2 - unusual but in the db it favours white.} Nf6 3. e3 Nc6 {3. ...... Nc6 - normal development - btw, there is an un-annotated version of the game in GOM where I did request gameknot analysis so you can follow the game there.} 4. a3 g6 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Nc3 d6 {6. ..... d6 - opening the lines for Fou Leblanc.} 7. d3 O-O {7. ...... 0-0 - for once I feel confident about putting Henry away on the kingside.  Freddy, strangely enough, does not think about an h4 pawn push which he lurves doing sometimes.} 8. Be2 Bd7 9. O-O {9. 0-0 - Freddy also hides his king on the kingside.} Qc8 10. b3 Re8 11. Nd2 Rb8 {11. ...... Rb8 - bolstering the b2 pawn.} 12. Bb2 a6 13. Nde4 Nxe4 14. dxe4 {14. dxe4 - after 14 moves, the first captures, a pair of knights is exchanged.} Ne7 15. Rad1 Be6 16. f4 Bg4 17. Nd5 {17. Nd5 - this move sparks off a few more trades.} Bxe2 18. Qxe2 Nxd5 19. cxd5 {19. cxd5 - interesting recapture, exd4 would have undoubled the centre pawns but Freddy is probably planning an attack down the c column.} f6 20. Qc4 {20. Qc4 - sure enough, the Wicked Witch of the West moves to the c column.} Kh8 21. Rf3 Qd7 {21. ...... Qd7 - after Freddy's rook lift which could spell a kingside mating attack, Glenda prepares to move over to the kingside to protect Henry.} 22. f5 g5 {22. ..... g5 - the first action of Operation Joblock.  A pawn advances to close up my position.} 23. Rh3 Kg8 24. Rc1 Re7 25. Bc3 Rc8 {25. ..... Rc8 - getting the c7 pawn adequately covered is a good thing because my KR is needed to defend my weakened kingside position here.} 26. Bb4 Rf7 27. Qd3 Bf8 {27. ...... Bf8 - it's musical squares for Fou Lenoir and my KR.} 28. Be1 Rg7 {28. ..... Rg7 - in the chat I said to Freddy that in putting my rook in front of Henry on g7 that rook was also looking at his king.  If Freddy was now to advance his pawns he would risk exposing his own king to an attack.} 29. Rc4 Be7 30. Rh6 Qd8 {30. ...... Qd8 - Glenda heads for e8 to stop her counterpart getting to h5.  If she does Glenda is prepared to sacrifice her life for the Witch.} 31. Rb4 Rb8 32. a4 {32. a4 - Freddy now starts pushing for a possible queenside opening.  He ain't gonna get it!} Bf8 33. Rc4 Rc8 34. Ba5 b6 {34. ..... b6 - oh rid me of this turbulent priest!} 35. Be1 a5 36. Rc6 Ra8 {36. ..... Ra8 - I do not wish the Wicked Witch to come into a6.} 37. Qc4 Ra7 38. Qb5 Be7 39. Kh1 Kf8 {39. ..... Kf8 - a lot of piece shuffling has been going on over the last few moves, now the two kings get in the mood!} 40. Qe2 Qe8 41. Bc3 Kg8 {41. .... Kg8 - more piece shuffling.} 42. h3 Kf8 43. g3 Kg8 {43. ...... Kg8 - white's position here is more active, but, should Freddy over-reach himself with the following ....... 44. h4 gxh4 45. gxh4 Qf7 46. Rh5 Rg3 47. Rh6 Qg7 48. Rh5 Rg1+ 49. Kh2 Qg3# So, Operation Joblock could finally bare its teeth - a lurvely 18 point chunk out of the Master Mater's rating! Freddy must take care.} 44. Kh2 Kf8 45. Qg4 Qf7 {45. ..... Qf7 - reinforcing the h7 pawn.} 46. Qh5 Qxh5 47. Rxh5 {45. Rxh5 - a queen trade has occurred as I mentioned in my note on move 30.} Kg8 48. g4 Kf7 49. Kg3 Bd8 50. h4 {50. h4 - at last he moves a pawn to h4.  I think he is trying to penetrate with his own king!} gxh4+ 51. Rxh4 Kg8 52. Bd2 Rb7 {52. ....... Rb7 - the shuffle continues.} 53. Rh5 Rg5 54. Rh2 {54. Rh2 - declines the trade, I think he wants to try and keep the two rooks on if he can because two rooks can do a lotta damage on a rank or a file.} Be7 55. Be1 Rg7 56. Rhc2 Bd8 {56. ..... Bd8 - again I must attend to the weak backward c7 pawn.} 57. Kf3 Kf7 {57. ..... Kf7 - my first draw offer ......} 58. g5 {58. g5 - ..... is declined with a pawn sac!} Rxg5 {58. ....... Rxg5 - a pawn is a pawn and I decided to take with the rook because I did not want Freddy to get a passer on the f column.} 59. Rh2 Rg7 60. Rh1 Kg8 61. Rc2 Ra7 {61. ...... Ra7 - and we do the shuffle again!} 62. Rch2 {62. Rch2 - ahha, a doubling on the h column, but Henry and my KR have the h7 pawn adequately covered and Fou Lenoir and my QR still have some free squares to move to to avoid a zugzwang.} Rb7 63. Rh2h6 Ra7 64. Bh4 Kf7 {64. ..... Kf7 - because the enemy dsb cuts communication between the two rooks, Henry can move to f7 to defend f6.  In the ensuing endgame, Henry is gonna be a right pain in the you know where for Freddy, teeheehee!} 65. Bg3 Kg8 66. b4 {66. b4 - another pawn sac, this time a temporary one to open up some lines of attack for Freddy's rooks.} axb4 67. Ra1 b3 {67. ...... b3 - might as well advance.} 68. Rhh1 Ra5 {68. ...... Ra5 - at last a more active placement for my rook.} 69. Bf2 Kf7 70. Rhb1 Ke8 {70. ...... Ke8 - Henry is very flexible.  He is moving, goalie like to defend kingside or queenside as and when required.} 71. Rxb3 Kd7 72. Rb5 Rxb5 {72. ...... Rxb5.  In the chat, I said this to Master Freddy. "Hi Freddy, I just hope I haven't taken 3 days to make a blunder - that usually happens against you. I did give the exchange a lot of thought and I am aware that it will open up the a column for your rook, but on the other hand my pawn structure will remain intact after you recapture. If I allowed you to take the rook then that would have left me with an isolani on the a column and you would have had a passed a pawn. Therefore I thought that the rook exchange was the better option. I feel that Henry and Fou Lenoir can hold the fort on the queenside should your rook decide to come down the a column. Hence the second draw offer." } 73. axb5 {73. axb5.  Freddy declined this draw offer and said "you are almost there but not just yet!" } Kc8 74. Bg3 Kb7 {74. ..... Kb7 - Henry moves to b7 to stop a rook incursion.} 75. Rc1 Kb8 76. Rc2 Kb7 77. Rg2 Kc8 {77. .... Kc8 - a rook trade is on the cards so Henry decides to move back to the kingside to stop his counterpart invading there.} 78. Bh4 Rxg2 79. Kxg2 {79. Kxg2 - the trade does take place and so Henry races back to the kingside.  The queenside is completely locked so I feel confident of the final outcome here!  Big words against an opponent like the Master Mater.} Kd7 80. Kf3 Ke8 81. Kg4 Kf7 {81. ...... Kf7 - Henry will certainly stop the enemy king in his tracks.} 82. Kh5 Kg7 83. Be1 { } Be7 {83. ...... Be7  - with this move I said the following to Freddy in the chat - Can you now see a way through the Joblock?! Fou Lenoir can still move about so I do not see you giving me a zugzwang here! easy19: it is not the joblock it just have the wrong bishop and i am out of options jstevens1: So, it looks like a draw after all! easy19: yep it is now make it a 3 fold it would be well deserved  I did try and do just that, only I forgot to tick the check box, but at the second attempt I did do it and the game was drawn.  This is only my second draw against Master strength opposition.  Do not knock the Joblock my friends, note that Freddy had to sac material to risk losing to try and avoid conceding a Low Draw.  One day an Expert such as Coach Ion may well over-reach himself in this way and pay the full penalty!  For now, I will just enjoy this result and then look to regain my Class A status.  Have a good read - bye for now - Joanne  } 84. Bh4 Bd8 85. Be1 Be7 86. Bh4 Bd8 87. Be1 Be7 {}
