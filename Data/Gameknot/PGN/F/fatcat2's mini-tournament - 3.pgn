1. d4 {After my crushing and stylish defeat at the hands of mrvroom, in my recent annotated game (the one called "I looked surprised but..."), I thought "Boy oh boy, I really want to do that to someone else". So, soon enough, I managed it.} e6 2. e4 {Instead of playing along the Queen Pawn game, I choose to transpose across to the French Defence with 2...e4.} g6 {Black must be aiming at fianchettoing his dark-squared bishop. If so, that rather defeats the purpose of 1...e6.} 3. Nf3 b6 4. Bd3 Bb7 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. O-O Nc6 7. e5 {Those of you who know my playing style will know that I always try if I can to establish a pawn in my opponent's side of the board. I have recently had several shocks when I failed to effectively back up my pawn formation and the whole lot has crashed down around my ears, so I am trying to be careful when doing this. However, my central pawn formation looks strong enough to hold here.} Qe7 8. Re1 O-O-O {When the two players castle on opposite sides, this always makes for a sharp game. This is probably because you can easily use pawns to help attack the enemy king's position if those pawns aren't shielding your king at the same time!} 9. Bg5 f6 {Black's only move to prevent a loss of material.} 10. exf6 Bxf6 11. Bxf6 Qxf6 12. Bb5 Nge7 13. Qd3 {On the one hand, I want to play Ba6 in the near future. Then if ...Bxa6 Qxa6  Kb8 Nb5 and Black's king is in a spot of bother. But then if Black did not play ...Bxa6, my attack would not succeed and I would lose the under-defended pawn on d4 into the bargain. So I moved my queen to d3, where it can back up the bishop move to a6 and defend the pawn on d5.} Nb4 {I had foreseen this. But the knight is no longer attacking the pawn on d5, so I can put my queen on e2, still attacking a6 and preventing ...Nxc2, forking my two rooks.} 14. Qe2 Qf5 15. Rec1 h5 16. a3 Na6 {A blunder, as 17.Bxa6 Bxa6 18.Qxa6 loses the knight.} 17. Bxa6 Kb8 18. Bxb7 Kxb7 19. a4 {Note that I would probably not have attempted that if my king had been castled on the queenside. Proof of how castling on opposite sides creates sharp games...or at least kingside attacks.} Nc6 20. a5 Nxa5 21. b4 Nc6 22. Qa6+ Ka8 {Now Black's king is really in trouble.} 23. Ne5 {I also considered 23.Nb5, but I eventually chose this. They both work.} Rdb8 24. Nxc6 Rb7 {An irritating setback, but sets the scene for a beautiful sacrifice and checkmate. Can you see it?} 25. Qxa7+ Rxa7 26. Rxa7# {Oh, I'm just going to show you anyway. A typical knight-and-rook checkmating formation, called the Arabian Mate, carrying the distinction of oldest checkmating pattern. A nice finish to an interesting game.}
