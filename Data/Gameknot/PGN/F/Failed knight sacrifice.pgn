1. e4 {A common move for white. My usual opening. I also like c4, d4 and g3.} e5 {A common move for black. As black, I prefer e6.} 2. f4 {My favorite opening. I like this opening, but lately I've been unlucky with it. I think I will try d4 and c4, which I've heard are better moves than e4 and f4 (Because of black playing e5 then d5). Lately every game I play goes 1.e4 e5,2.f4 exf4,3.Nf3 g5,4.Bc4 g4,5.Ne5 Qh4, 6.Kf1 Nh6,7.d4 d6,8.Nd3. What am I doing wrong?} exf4 {For those who don't know, my goal was to sacrifice a pawn to get a good attack on f7 (eventually) and to get a good center now that the pawn on e5 is gone. In most games, white will regain the pawn and will keep a good position. In other games, white will not regain the pawn, but will have a huge advance in development. Common moves for white now are Nf3, Bc4 and d4.} 3. Nf3 {This move keeps pressure on the center and stops the black Queen from going to h4.} g5 {The most common move at this point. Black will try a quick attack on the king in some games, and in others, the goal was to defend f4 I hear h4 is good for white, but I don't see it.} 4. Bc4 {Continuing development. Usually my next move would be d4, but not in this game.} g4 {I have several options here. I like Ne5, but I went with something new this time.} 5. O-O {White is sacrificing a knight for a huge advance in development.} gxf3 {If black doesn't take, my development would be great compared to black.} 6. Qxf3 {I have a bishop, Queen and rook all charging at f7. Black's goal is to defend without giving any pieces away.} Qf6 {Qxf4 would ruin the entire point of the attack.} 7. d3 {Developing the bishop.} Nc6 {Developing the knight.} 8. Bxf4 {My attack is still strong. I still have to think about attacking and trading as few pieces possible.} Nd4 {2 most common moves are Qf2 and Qh5 for white. Qf2 is much more defensive, the opposite that I need to be know.} 9. Qh5 {Black has to be careful, my attack is getting stronger (Can you believe that I'm going to lose in 3 moves.).} Ne6 {Black needs to defend. This was probobly the best move.} 10. Be5 {The winning move for me. I either win the Queen or rook.} Bc5+ {If I would have played slower, I would have noticed d4, which wins. I would have also noticed that the white rook wasn't defended.} 11. Kh1 {Oups.} Qxf1# {I wouldn't have been to disappointed if this game was a normal game, but this was in the 73rd gameknot tournament. I still have good chances of winning round 2, but I need to play slower now. I wonder if I would have won with d4. }
