[Opening "Sicilian (B78), dragon, Yugoslav attack, 10.O-O-O"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian defence. } 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {Dragon variation. The idea of Black is to control black squares and attack Nd4. } 6. Be3 {White defends his Nd4. } Bg7 7. f3 {Preventing Black's Nf3 to come to g4. } O-O 8. Qd2 {The Queen works well on the c1-h6 diagonal with Be3, attacking possibly weak Black's squares. } Nc6 {A tipical idea of the Sicilian defense by Black is to advance pawns on the Queen side, maybe Bc8 on the a8-h1 diagonal and Ra8 to the c-file. } 9. Bc4 {White develops his white bishop to a more active square, but he'll need to guard it from possible advances of the Black b pawn. } Bd7 10. O-O-O Rc8 {According to the plan, Black develops his rook on the semi-open c-file. } 11. Bb3 {Bishop to safety, guarding the possibly weak c2 pawn. } Nxd4 {Better would be for Black to chase Bb3 with Na5 or control the center with Ne5 with the idea of jumping to c4. Alternatively, a5 would start the pawn rolling. Black here is not following the spirit of the Sicilian Defence. } 12. Bxd4 a5 13. Nd5 {Putting pressure on Nf6. White wants to get rid of Black's Bg7. } Nxd5 14. Bxg7 {Before recapturing the knight, White takes exchanges the black bishops. Black King recaptures and he's in a dangerous square. } Kxg7 15. Bxd5 {White can recapture with Queen or with bishop, to avoid having to back up in case Black chases her. White has to be careful in case of b5 and a4, because with e6 the bishop would be trapped. } Qc7 {Ties White's Queen to the defence of c2. } 16. h4 {All by the book. White starts the pawn advance on the King's side. } a4 {Black pushes, but the a-pawn is not supported well enough. } 17. a3 {White is scared by the a-pawn, but it shouldn't be. He should concentrate on his King-side advance. } f5 {Black wants to stop White advance, but much better would be h5, or h6 or e6. f5 leaves too many weak squares behind, like: e7 (weak pawn), e6 and the whole a1-h8 diagonal where White Queen can always check on d4. } 18. exf5 {White decides to take the pawn, but probably better would be h5. Maybe we wants to avoid an isolated e-pawn in case of exchange on e4. } Bxf5 {Adding pressure to c2. } 19. c3 h5 {The threat of h5 is always present to Black thinks to stop it advancing to h5. White's can use his pawn majority and attack h5 anyway. } 20. Qg5 {White misses the opportunity to take the a4 pawn with Qd4. Alternative variation: 20.g4! [Better would be to continue the attack on h5.] 20...hxg4 21.fxg4 Bd7 [Bishop has to retreat to d7 and then h5 is unstoppable.]  } b5 {A move that should have been done before, that now has little meaning. } 21. g4 {White has multiple targets. h5, as usual, or the weak pawn on e7 with Rhe1. He chooses to carry on with h5. } b4 {Black decides to defende himself attacking White Queen-side. But it's not a good idea. } 22. gxf5 Rxf5 23. Qe3 {White's King-side pawns are wrecked and now White's Queen need to guard f3, too. } bxc3 24. Qxc3+ {Correctly White wants to exchange Queens and go in an endgame with the advantage. } Qxc3+ 25. bxc3 Rxc3+ 26. Kb2 Rc5 27. Be4 Rcb5+ 28. Ka2 Rfc5 29. Rdb1 Rxb1 30. Bxb1 Kf6 {Black's idea is to push d and e pawns with support by his King. } 31. Rg1 g5 {g5 is doubly attacked, so Black advances it where it is guarded by both K and R. } 32. Rh1 d5 33. hxg5+ Kxg5 34. f4+ Kxf4 {Better would have been to ignore the pawn with Kg4 and push the d-pawn more. } 35. Rxh5 {At this point, either the a4 pawn or the e7 pawn are doomed, by either Rh4 or Re5 (if Ke3). Black chooses to save his e-pawn. } e6 36. Rh4+ Kf3 37. Rxa4 e5 38. Kb3 e4 39. Rd4 e3 {The two passed pawns are too powerful and even if White has a bishop, this match will end in a draw. } 40. Bd3 e2 41. Bxe2+ Ke3 42. Rh4 Kxe2 {}
