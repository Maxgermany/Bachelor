[Opening "QGD (D31), 3.Nc3"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {This is considered an inaccuracy although I did not play the appropriate moves to take advantage. Generally White should play 4. a3 Bxc3 or 4. Qa4+ Nc6 which both give White a strong game.} 4. Nf3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 {The book considers Bxc3+ generally not such a great idea because White fairly easily undoubles the pawns and often ends up with the Bishop pair} f6 {This move puzzled me. It seems to block of the Kingside Knight and weaken that side of board in general} 6. e3 {I probably should have played 6. cxd5 to undouble the pawns immediately} Ne7 7. Bd3 dxc4 8. Bxc4 {This wastes a Bishop move which could have been avoided with cxd5 earlier} c6 {Blocking off the other knight from easy development} 9. O-O O-O {With my light squared Bishop and Queen on the board, Black's king seem awfully exposed to attack after the castle} 10. Qb3 b5 {My opponent overlooks the natural attack} 11. Bxe6+ Bxe6 12. Qxe6+ Kh8 13. e4 {I'm just trying to get pieces out now and find an attack later} Ng6 {Really the only place to develop the Knight although I thought offering a Queen trade with 13. ... Qd7 14. Qxd7 Nxd7 wasn't bad for Black at all although White isn't forced to trade and probably should not} 14. Qh3 {I'm looking at pushing the e-pawn and probably the f-pawn to make an attack} Qc7 15. g3 {This prevents 15. ... Nf4 threatening the Queen and then 16. ... Ne2+} Nd7 16. Nh4 {Clearing the path for the f-pawn if needed and getting rid of the pesky defender} Nxh4 17. Qxh4 Qd6 {I'm not sure this was a useful move. Perhaps 17. ... c5 18. d5 Qa5 is better} 18. a4 {My opponent gave me an opportunity with 17. ... Qd6 and so I played this instead of pushing the f-pawn} Qe6 {Avoiding 19. Ba3 which wins an exchange} 19. axb5 {Both getting rid of my isolated pawn and opening the file for the Rook} Qc4 {Thinking perhaps 20. bxc6 Qxc3 puts White in danger but I have 21. Ba3 which leaves both Black's Rook and Knight under attack} 20. bxc6 Qxc6 21. Bd2 {Protecting the c-pawn without exposing the Bishop on the open b-file} Qe6 22. Qf4 g5 {Chasing the Queen around but opening the a1-h8 diagonal for eventual penetration by the Bishop} 23. Qe3 Rfg8 24. Rfb1 Rab8 {This gives away another pawn but Black is not in such a great position} 25. Rxb8 Rxb8 26. Rxa7 {Snatching another pawn and placing a Rook on the always dangerous 7th Rank} Rb1+ 27. Kg2 Nf8 28. d5 {This was a good move I thought. It starts to open the long diagonal for my Bishop and forces Black to move his Queen} Qd6 29. c4 Qb6 {Up three pawns a Queen trade is good for White} 30. Qxb6 Rxb6 31. Bc3 {Finally on that inviting diagonal} Kg8 32. c5 {My pawn advantage is telling at this point of the game. Black doesn't have many options} Rb8 33. Bxf6 g4 {Black just doesn't have many moves. The Rook cannot interfere with the coming mate. The best move is probably 33. ... h6 which loses more slowly to 34. Rg7+ Kh8 35. Rb7+ Kg7 36. Rxb8} 34. Rg7+ Kh8 35. Rxg4# {I was not particularly pleased with my play in this game upon analyzation because I could have done more when my opponent played the early 3. ... Bb4. Still, I managed to make some good moves and slowly gain an overwhelming advantage.}
