1. d3 {This is another game between 2 friends that I said I would annotate. Any comments would be most gratefully received.  Personally I am not keen on this opening as it means whites light squared bishop (lsb) is going to take at least two moves to get out - e.g. g3...Bg2, I am however no expert on openings.} d5 2. Nf3 d4 {An agressive start by black  This already takes us out of the Gameknot database} 3. Na3 {Generally this is not a good move as it restricts the mobility of the knight, an alternative for white would be Nb-d2 but that would then mean both the white bishops were obstructed, for me the better options would be g3 - looking for Bg2, or e4} Nc6 {preparing e5} 4. c3 {opens a line to a4 for the queen which would pin c6} e5 {This gives black space to move, it opens a line for his dsb and his queen} 5. Nc4 {This is a tough one as it puts a poorly placed piece into a much better position, however white's efforts should be spent on developing his bishops. This move also breaks the unwritten rule about never moving a piece twice before you have completed development} Bd6 {Blacks bishop feels slightly awkward to me now i.e. its scope feels limited, I would have been tempted by e4 which might give something like  6.	dxe4	dxc3 7.	Qxd8+	Nxd8 8.	bxc3	 which would give white some significant problems with his pawn structure with the compensation that he could grab some half open files} 6. Bg5 {This is a weak threat, although it develops the bishop with tempo it allows black to develop as he may have wished to anyway} Nf6 7. Qa4 {This is a very early (and perhaps premature) queen move, it means black can gain tempo by attacking the queen. White should be looking to develop his f1 bishop} h6 {This seems a wasted move by black, it weakens his king side pawn structure where he should be looking to castle, the white dsb is less threatening than the queen. Another possibility is a6 looking for the fork with b5 and threatening a pawn attack on the queenside} 8. Bd2 {Perhaps better would be h4 maintaining pressure on the knight. If black attacked with g5 castling on the king side would be risky at best} Bd7 {Breaks the pin.} 9. e3 {I don't really understand this move, white knows that black is unlikely to take it. If whites next move is exd4 the e rank will be opened exposing his king} Nb4 {Revealed attack on the white queen, this is a mistake from black as he loses material} 10. Nxd6+ cxd6 11. Qxb4 dxe3 {This is a poor move from black though it does undouble his pawns} 12. Bxe3 {This seems a better place for whites dsb} Bc6 {defends the b pawn and the d pawn from the white queen} 13. Be2 {White has nearly completed his development and should look to castle soon} Nd5 14. Qg4 {Threatening the g pawn} O-O {Risky move from black as white now has the threat of Bxh6} 15. d4 {Much better was Bxh6 threatening the black king. Also playable is for white to castle} e4 {This is a very poor move from black, Nh4 would only help the white attack} 16. Qxe4 {This seems an odd move by white. Nh4 brings his knight into the assault, also playable was Bxh6} Nxc3 {Double attack on the white queen} 17. Qf5 {The white queen is better on g4} Be4 {Black isn't achieving much doing this his lsb was well placed, it is now in a worse position than it was, he needs his king} 18. Qg4 f5 19. Qg3 Nxe2 20. Kxe2 {White can't castle directly but this isn't a major problem as Rhe1, Kf1 will mean he has "castled" the long way } Qd7 {Black finally completes his development. links his rooks and most important of all, defends the g pawn though much better would be Qf6 which also gives some protection to the h pawn} 21. Bxh6 {Finally, though black can defend easily now} Rf7 {This move isn't essential, better might have been Rac8} 22. Ng5 {I think this is a mistake by white as it allows gxh6 which might lead to 22 Nxe4+, Rg7 and the white attack is halted.  With hindsight this is one of the moves that loses the game for white as it gives black the intiative} Qb5+ {The best form of defence is attack, though its not clear where this attack is going} 23. Ke3 {This seems an odd move by white as it presents black with Qd2+ putting white under serious pressure, d2 or e2 seem slightly safer options (though not much as the black rooks have access to the e and c files)} f4+ {nicely forking the white queen, white is in major trouble now} 24. Qxf4 {A fatal error from white, the queen is lost anyway, this move loses the game though other options are little better} Qd3# {I think this is a good example of how being materially ahead does not guarantee a win.  I'm sure any comments would be gratefully received}
