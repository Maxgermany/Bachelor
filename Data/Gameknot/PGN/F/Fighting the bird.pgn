1. f4 {Bird's Opening. I've only played against this once before, back when I was about a 1350 USCF player. I beat a 1774 rated man in the first round of a tournament (because he ran into severe time trouble).} Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. e3 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Be2 {His pawns point to my kingside, so I can expect a kingside attack.} O-O {I've done my kingside development. Next I'm ready to play c5.} 6. d4 c5 7. dxc5 Qa5 8. Nd4 Ne4 {I'd prefer that he castles kingside, but I can't imagine him doing it. I wasn't brave enough to try e5 to force him to play fxe5 and I'd have an open file to attack that weak pawn on e3.} 9. Bd2 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 Qxc5 11. O-O-O Nc6 12. Nb3 Bxc3 {Probably unsound to trade my bishop pair away.} 13. Nxc5 Bxd2+ 14. Rxd2 e6 15. e4 b6 {That's forced, though I may end up with an isolated queen pawn. Usually it's only an asset early in the middle game as an attack agent or to support outposts for knights on c4 and e4.} 16. exd5 exd5 17. Bb5 Nb4 {Seems like the only place I can put the knight. I thought about Ne7 and after we trade knights, then I can play d4, but I lose a pawn after Bc6.} 18. Nd3 a5 {I'm not thrilled with this move, but any option to save the knight will lose the pawn on d5. This move will leave me doubled pawns if he trades, but I'll be guarding the d-pawn from the side and may get to use the a-file, and he may have to use a pawn to eventually trade off my doubled pawn.} 19. a3 Nxd3+ 20. Rxd3 {No way I can keep from losing that d-pawn.  That's (one of) the problem with an isolated queen pawn. The further into the game you get, the weaker it becomes and harder to defend.} Be6 21. Bc6 Rad8 22. Rhd1 Rdc8 23. Bxd5 Bf5 24. Rd3d2 Rfe8 25. c3 Bg4 26. Rf1 Bf5 {I like having my bishop block his pawn.} 27. Bb7 Rc5 28. Bf3 {I think he's threatening g4 to drive away my bishop. I'll probably play h5 to delay that.} h5 29. Rd4 Kg7 30. Kd2 Rc7 31. Re1 Rxe1 32. Kxe1 Re7+ 33. Kd2 Re6 34. c4 Kf6 35. b4 Bg4 {When is it okay to not make the best move? When you know that the best move leads to a loss. He's going to trade the pawns on the queenside and have an outside passed pawn, and that's the game. Probably the best move is Kd7. But if there's any hope for me, I've got to stir things up and cause some trouble. So, it's time to make a less than best move.} 36. Bxg4 hxg4 37. bxa5 bxa5 38. Kd3 Kf5 39. c5 Re1 40. Rc4 {}
