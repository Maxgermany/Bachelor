1. e4 {This game was a training match with a teammate of mine.  We both have room for improvement, so welcome any and all comments to help us all improve together.  } e6 {French Defense.  Fairly common response to e4.  Another benefit of the French is that it precludes my favorite, King's Gambit.} 2. d4 d5 {All book so far.} 3. Nd2 {Protects e4 pawn, provides development of knight, and also allows an eventual c3 push to protect d4.} c5 {Great counterattack to the center and provide an obvious recapture point via Bxc5.} 4. Ngf3 {Develops and links the remaining knight and provides protection for d4} cxd4 {Resolving the center build up.} 5. exd5 {Regaining pawn parity and offering some counterplay options and multiple paths for continuation.  } Qxd5 {I think that this play is better than exd5} 6. Bc4 {Developing the bishop and threatening the queen.} Qd6 {The choices for where to put the queen are more numerous now.  I think Qd6 is the best play.  Another option worth considering is Qc5.  } 7. O-O Nf6 {Prepping for a castle} 8. Nb3 {Allowing space for DSB to develop and threatening recapture of d pawn.} Nc6 {Natural development and adding some protection to the d4 pawn.} 9. Nfxd4 {There is always a consideration of which piece to use for capture when you have multiple options.  Of the two knights I like this one better, because I think it is more likely to cause Black to recapture with the knight.  } Nxd4 10. Nxd4 Be7 {Prepping for the castle} 11. c3 {Allowing some more mobility options for the queen.} O-O 12. Bg5 {Completing White's development.} Qc5 {I might have considered Rd8 or Qc7 here.  Black threatens the bishop prompting action.} 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Bd3 {Adding some options for eventual Qc2 and/or Bh7+.  Note that threat of Bh7+ prevents loss of the c pawn.} b6 {I liked Rd8 here better, but the intent is to give the LSB a development spot.} 15. Nb3 {Denying the LSB a chance to develop yet.} Qc6 {Giving potential for Bb7 to threaten mate.  } 16. Re1 {Threatening Be4 skewer.} Rd8 {A small mistake here.  While it does prevent the immediate B4 it does cough up a pawn for free.} 17. Qc2 g6 {This move is a blunder.  To save the pawn Black missed the skewer threat.} 18. Be4 Rd5 {Best option to prevent outright lose the rook at a8.} 19. Bxd5 {A mistake on my part.  Just moved too quickly.  c4 wins the rook.} Qxd5 20. Rad1 {Rooks love open files} Qc6 {Keeping the potential mate threat alive on the main diagonal.} 21. Qe4 {My intent here was to force a queen trade.  I might have opened more options by Nd4 instead.  Although I am up a bishop for a rook (instead of a full rook!) the two bishop advantage can eventually prove problematic in an open board.} Qxe4 22. Rxe4 Bb7 {Obvious follow up} 23. Re2 {Hoping for a rook battery soon.} Rc8 {Perhaps Bd5 to take away the rook file and centralize the bishop.} 24. Nd2 {I probably should have played Rd7 instead to allow me to double up rooks on the open file} Rd8 {pinning my knight.} 25. Rb1 {Ree1 may have been a better play.} Bg5 26. Nb3 Ba6 27. Ree1 Kg7 28. Nd4 {Centralizing the knight.} Bb7 29. Rbd1 Bd5 30. b3 {Protecting the a pawn and setting up a c-pawn push.} Bf6 31. c4 Bb7 {I thought Black would trade here instead.} 32. Nb5 {Missed opportunity on my part. 32.	Nxe6+	fxe6 33.	Rxd8	Bxd8 34.	Rd1	Bxg2 35.	Rxd8  would have netted two free pawns and ripped apart Black's pawn structure.} Re8 33. Rd7 {Looking for a free pawn instead.} Bc6 {Best response.} 34. Rxa7 Rd8 {Taking the free file and potentially making it difficult for my rook to escape.} 35. Kf1 {To allow my e1 rook to move.} Rd2 {Perhaps with an eye towards Bd4 and a chance at perpetual check to force a draw.} 36. Nc7 {I looked long and hard at Rxe6 but ultimately opted for this play just in case black decided to play Bd4.  Black has a couple of options here on defense.} Bd4 {Blunder for Black.  Best play was Bd7.} 37. Nxe6+ {This play will break Black's dual bishop threat and allow some rook action in Black's backyard.} Kf6 38. Nxd4 Rxd4 39. Ree7 {Now Black has some ugly choices left.} b5 {Threatening Bxb5+ if the c-pawn captures.} 40. Rac7 {Prolonging the moment of Rxf7+ and offering some counter-capture options on the Black bishop.} Be4 {Not the best play as it locks in Black's remaining rook.} 41. Rexf7+ Kg5 {Note that if Black moved his king towards the center bad things could have happened.} 42. Rfd7 {I also considered cxb5 instead but felt it more important to get rid of his last remaining rook threat.} Rxd7 {I think Bd3+ was a better play.} 43. Rxd7 bxc4 44. b4 {I can trade my rook for his pawn and bishop (if not just take the pawn outright) and the protected passed pawns will guarantee a win.  If I retake the pawns are isolated and not as powerful.} c3 45. Rc7 {Overall a good game on both sides.  Black made a few mistakes that put him behind early and those compounded over time, but still a strong showing.  Appreciate your comments and rating.}
