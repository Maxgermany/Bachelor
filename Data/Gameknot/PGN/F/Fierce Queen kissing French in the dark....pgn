[Opening "French (C02), advance, Wade variation"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {in the old days, I always treated the French defense kind of brutal; at this point, I usually played exd5, exd5, c4?! (turn things into Queens' Gambit lines), dxc4, Bxc4, and take it from there... that works fine in Blitz, but not here, as I learned the hard way from previous games; what suits me best then, is the Advance Variation...} c5 {by the book...} 4. c3 Qb6 {usually Nc6, Nf3, Qb6...} 5. Nf3 Bd7 6. a3 {still by the book (Euwe recommendation): theory follows with Nc6, b4, cxd4, cxd4, Rc8, Be3, Nge7, Bd3...} a5 {obviously to block b4, but White has other options...} 7. Bd3 {still following Euwe's recommendation; unclear is Qc2, Ne7, dxc5 (Bd3, c4), Qxc5, a4, Ng6...} Bb5 8. Bxb5+ Qxb5 9. a4 Qd7 {not the best reply; Qb6 holds the pressure on b2 making Be3 impossible, so White has to find other ways to develop...} 10. O-O Nc6 11. Be3 {still following Euwe; after this, we are in the dark in this opening...} cxd4 {theory continues with Nge7 and/or Rc8...} 12. Bxd4 Nh6 {on the way to f5, so White has to react...} 13. Nbd2 Nf5 14. Nb3 Be7 {making up for lost tempo: Black needs to castle quickly, before White can develop an attack...} 15. Qe2 {taking the opportunity, left by Qd7...} O-O 16. Qb5 {at least, White is holding Nc6 in place for a little while...} Rfc8 17. Rfe1 {mainly covering for e5...} Nfxd4 {Black had better prepare this, with Ra6 somewhere followed by Rb6...} 18. Nbxd4 {the right Knight; we might still need Nf3 to cover for e5...} Qc7 {Black needs to get out of the pin...} 19. Qd3 {so the White Queens' work is done; we prepare Rac1 and b3...} Na7 {better looking is Nxd4, Nxd4, Ra6!, Qg3 (needs to cover for e5), Rb6... also directly Qb6, posts the same problems for White... this is obviously preparing Qc4, or some other way of preparing to trade Queens; like Nc6, Nb5, Nxe5, Nxc7, Nxd3...} 20. Re2 {this move covers most of Blacks' options...} Qc4 {other options were Rd8, Qe3, Rac8, or Rab8, h3 (to counter checks on the bottom row), Qc5, or Qb6, Rd2, Rc4, b3, Rc7...} 21. Rd2 {the only move: Re3 is losing tempo; otherwise we should have played 20. Re3 directly... but after 20. ... Rab8, we would have to play Re2 again, forcing Qxc4 after Qc4; another loss of tempo...} h6 22. h3 {both Kings are preparing to leave the K's row...} Qxd3 {better Rab8, to force Qxc4, Rxc4...} 23. Rxd3 Rc7 {obviously preparing Rac8, to prevent an early b3; but White has more options, since Rac1 solves that problem... but considering the possibility Nb5, square c7 might not be a safe place to be... better Nc6 or Bc5...} 24. h4 {taking up space and tempo while we still can...} Kh7 {certainly not the best move here; after Rb8, h5, b5, White must act... after axb5, Nxb5, Black is in the game again...} 25. h5 {on we go; we might be planning g4, Kg2, Rh1, and set up a new front of attacks...} Rg8 {still, Rb8 or Bc5 were best...} 26. Kf1 {change of plans; g4 will not help against g6 or worse g5, with the King on g1...} g5 {there you have it; insufficient is Nh2, g4, Rg3... after g4, Bc5!, Ke2, Rgc8!, I could not find any progress...} 27. hxg6 e.p.+ {the best option...} Rxg6 28. b3 {in search for play after b5, followed by axb5... after Bc5, Re1, to cover for e5...} Rg4 {I had overseen this; Black is threatening Re4 all of a sudden... then, after Bc5 and Bxd4, all kinds of new problems arise for White, concerning e5...} 29. Re1 {or g3, Bc5, Re1... better still, might be Rc1!, preparing c4...} Ba3 {after Re4, always Nd2; best here is Bc5, g3, Re4! (now, Nd2 might lead to trouble for White), and let White work this out...} 30. g3 Re4 {at this point, all threats are gone; still better was Bc5, to compromise Nd4...} 31. Nd2 Rg4 {best here was Rxe1+, Kxe1, Bc5, N2f3, Nc6, and try to pry open the c-file...} 32. c4 {the quickest way to solve this; also possible were Nc2 or Kg2, followed by Bc5, all leading to roughly the same variations: driving Rg4 away with f3, f4, etcetera, and at some point Rh1...} Bc5 33. Nc2 Be7 {somewhat better - but equally hard for Black - is dxc4, Nxc4, Nc6, Ne4, h5, Rh1, Kh6, f4...} 34. Ne3 {forcing Black to take action...} dxc4 {the only move: Black can not allow cxd5, or his position will fall apart...} 35. Ndxc4 {a tough decision: after Nexd4, we still have the possibility f3, after Ne4; but after that, I found nothing to make progress... at least, now we hold the pressure while driving Rg4 away...} Rg5 {one of the best replies to be found, controlling e5; losing is Rg6, Red1, Bb4 (the best move), Rd7...} 36. Red1 {we have the time, to postpone Kg2 and f4; plus, we still need to keep on guard for h5... this move is preparing Rd7, and trading the one Black defending Rook...} Nc6 {best here is still Bc5; after Whites' next set of moves, things are getting out of hand soon...} 37. Rd3d7 Rxd7 38. Rxd7 Bc5 {now, Bc5 is practically forced...} 39. Rxf7+ Rg7 {the only move, to prevent worse...} 40. Rxg7+ Kxg7 41. Nc2 Kg6 42. Ne1 {all practically forced for both sides, up until now... after Kf5, we need Nd3...} Nd4 {wrong timing...  better Kf5, Nd3 (forced), b6, and let White work it out...} 43. Nxa5 {no hesitation; White is winning another free pawn...} b6 {forced...} 44. Nd3 {even stronger than before; this forces bxa5, Nxc5, Kf5, f4, h5...} Kf5 {too soon; White is winning tempo here...} 45. Nb7 {now, after Nxb3 (what else?), White has the choice between f4, Ndxc5 or even a5...} Be7 {a move Black cannot afford; after Nxb3, f4 (the best, relieving Nd3), Bd4, Nd6+, Kg4, Kg2, Bc5, Nf7, Black is in enough trouble as it is...} 46. Nd6+ Bxd6 {probably the only way, to keep Whites' connected rogue pawns under some control; after running from check, of course always b4, Nc6, b5, Nd4...} 47. exd6 e5 {a dangerous and probably losing flaw; much needed was at least Kf6, to counter d7 with Ke7, eg. Kf6, b4, Nf5, d7, Ke7...} 48. d7 Nc6 {now, the Black Knight has to come to the rescue; slightly better is Ne6, Nb4, Ke4, Nc6, Kd5, d8Q+, Nxd8, Nxd8, Kc5, Nf7, e4, Nxh6, Kb4...} 49. Nb4 {winning the game...} Nd8 {no use is Ke6, Nxc6, Kxd7, Nxe5+, Ke6, Nc4, b5, a5!, bxc4, bxc4...} 50. Nd5 {relentless: after Ke6, Nxb6, covering for d7; which will be traded against e5, after Nc4 at some point, so Black resigns...}
