[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03)"]

1. e4 Nf6 {not surprisingly, this is evaluated as the strongest reply to e4, without thinking too much ahead; attack the pawn... the Alekhine defense...} 2. e5 {the idea behind the Alekhine defense, is to lure Whites' center pawns forward in order to be able to attack them more easily...} Nd5 3. d4 Nc6 {or straightaway d6...} 4. Nf3 {the Flohr approach...} e6 {preparing Bb4+ and a possible attack supported by both Knights; much sounder is d6, to open a diagonal for Bc8 and prepare Bg4... this will bury Bc8 for a very long time...} 5. c4 {also a3 would have been an option first, to rule out Nb4 of Bb4; but this works much better...} Bb4+ {after Nb6, d5, exd5, cxd5, Bb4+, Nc3, Ne7, d6, cxd6, exd6, Ned5, Qe2+, Kf8 is not nice; but better than this...} 6. Bd2 Bxd2+ {better is Nde7, d5, exd5, Bxb4, Nxb4, a3, Na6, cxd5, 0-0...} 7. Nbxd2 {objectively stronger is Qxd2, Nb6, d5, Ne7, d6, cxd6, exd6, Nc6, Nc3, 0-0, Bd3; but we have a better plan... it is always a good idea, to complicate matters against a chess machine...} Nb6 {or Nde7, Bd3, d6, Qb3, 0-0...} 8. a3 {preparing b4 somewhere in the future, while preventing Nb4; as long as Black has not played d6, we can virtualy play anything...} O-O {d6, c5, dxc5, dxc5, Nd5 was still an option here...} 9. Bd3 d5 {the last chance to play d6 has gone by: Bc8 is a lost piece; furthermore, this robs Black of the possibility to play Nd5...} 10. c5 Nd7 11. b4 {getting ready to harass the other Knight; we keep piling up complications...} Qe7 {the Thinking Machine works in mysterious ways; better a6, to prevent more mayhem... Black is preparing Nd8, after b5...} 12. Qc2 {I liked this better than b5, Nd8, 0-0, f5; this is practically forcing f5...} g6 {after f5, b5, Nd8, 0-0, Qe8, a4, White has a strong edge; but not more than that... this will get Black into trouble...} 13. h4 {opening a full scale attack on Blacks' Kings wing; also preparing Ng5...} Kh8 {never argue with a chess machine; but f5, b5, Nd8, a4, Nb8, 0-0, Bd7 was much to be preferred over this... finally Bc8 would have had a purpose...} 14. Rb1 {maybe taking things too easy, in preparing a blunt a4, followed by b5 and c6, and crack open Blacks' Queens wing with something like Qxc7: straightaway h5, g5, b5, looks more promising; but Black has nothing...} Rd8 {again, a move that probably only a chess machine would understand: most likely preparing Nf8, but prohibiting Nd8; this was the last call for a6, a4, a5, b5, Nb4, to prevent more trouble...} 15. a4 {made possible by the seemingly insignificant Rb1, a while ago: also here, h5 was very strong; but we wait for the right moment...} f5 {here is the moment: f5 comes too late; after a5, b5, Nb4, Qc3, f6!, h5, g5, Black would have at least had some control; now, White is unleashed...} 16. b5 Ncb8 {after Na5, h5...} 17. Rg1 {maybe not the best - which is of course h5 -  but since Black is in an awkward position already - with virtually no pieces developed - we can easily prepare g4 to crack open all defenses...} f4 {not the best way to prevent g4; best here was probably a6, Kf1 (the White King has to leave the bottom row at some point, after g4, fxg3, Rxg3, and Kg2), Rg8...} 18. g4 a5 {after fxg3, Rxg3, Rg8, Ng5, the plot thickens...} 19. Ng5 {also here, a direct h5 spells a lot of trouble for Black; but we have time on our side, and Ndf3 looks pretty lethal...} b6 {Kg7, Ndf3, h6, Nh3...} 20. Ndf3 {directly winning is Bxg6, Rg8 (hxg6, Qxg6 ends all), Nxh7, bxc5, h5!... but I was kept busy by just understanding this machine...} bxc5 21. h5 cxd4 {the losing move: after c4, Bxg6, hxg6, Qxg6, Rf8 (to prevent Nf7+), Black might still have something to play for; this ends it rapidly...} 22. hxg6 hxg6 {after Kg7, Qxc7, threatening Qxd8+!, Qxd8, Nxe6+, recapturing the Queen...} 23. Rh1+ Kg8 {Kg7, Rh7+, loses the Queen...} 24. Rh7 {also Bxg6, d3, Qxc7, wins easily...} Qa3 {not the way, to get out of this; the only realistic try was Qxh7, Nxh7, Kxh7, Ng5+, Kh8, and hope for complications...} 25. Ke2 {after Bxg6, to be followed by Nxe6, I feared Qxf3; of course totally unjust, because of Ng5 covering for Nf3 (at the moment)... but the pieces are sometimes hard to recognize on this board; all this apart from the mesmerizing graphics I was experiencing at that moment: truly distracting...} Bb7 {the lost Bishop finally emerges, but way too late: after Nf8, Qxc7, Rd7, Qxc8, Rxh7, Nxh7, Kxh7, Qb7+, Nbd7, Qxa8, Black can safely give up...} 26. Rbh1 {postponing the stronger Nxe6, with mate in all variations; but this works also... after this, the Thinking Machine went in full Guru mode, to be never heard of again; obviously resigning was not built into this algorithm... unfortunately, this great piece of software has one serious flaw: it castles under check; otherwise a true piece of art... go check it out, because it plays a mean game of chess also... }
