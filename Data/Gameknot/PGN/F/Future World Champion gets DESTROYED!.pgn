[Opening "Danish gambit (C21), Collijn defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. d4 {The Center Game. Possibly this was an attempt to gain favor with the British champion Blackburne (who played it a lot.) Who can tell?....but what this move does signify is a willingness on the part of white to totally rip up the middle of the board.} exd4 {Black sees the chance to start gaining material, so he starts gobbling.} 3. c3 {The Danish Gambit. White opts to cede material for rapid development.} dxc3 {An old chess adage says "The best way to refute a gambit is to accept it." Black continues to gobble pawns while neglecting the development of his pieces.} 4. Bc4 {Developing and aiming at the weak square f7.} cxb2 {Gobble, gobble again.......Lasker HAD to be aware that after 5. Bxb2 that he is SEVERELY down in development. Didn't he?} 5. Bxb2 Qg5 {? d5, Nf6, or even d6 were better alternatives. While it appears that black is salivating over yet another pawn (the g pawn), it's somewhat poisonous after..............} 6. Nf3 {Furthering white's development while attacking the enemy queen.} Qxg2 {Black's appetite for white pawns is almost insatiable.} 7. Rg1 {Black's greed is going to be his downfall. This move secures the g file for white. Look at the forces being brought to bear on  f7 and g7.} Bb4+ {Black finally develops with an aggressive check.} 8. Ke2 {! No way white is gonna interfere with the potency of his dark squared bishop by trying to block that check.} Qh3 {Preserving black's queen.} 9. Bxf7+ {! 9...KxB is suicidal after white replies with the Royal Fork 10. Ng5 .} Kd8 {9...Kf8 fails due to the dangers after 10. Bxg7 } 10. Bxg7 {White is assured of gaining the Rh8 at a minimum. Just look at black's underdeveloped kingside!} Ne7 {? As passive as it may seem, 10...d6 was the saving move, as the white queen is aiming directly at the black king.} 11. Ng5 {Attacking the black queen.....but can you see where he is heading?} Qh4 {Congratulations Lasker....you have saved your queen. And oh, by the way.....................} 12. Ne6# {Checkmate! I think this game goes to prove the point that pawn grabbing just for the sake of pawn grabbing is an affliction that can affect all of us - from patzers like me to World Champions like Lasker. I'm reminded of the phrase "If it looks too good to be true then it usually is." Lasker learned that concept the hard way in this game as his voracious appetite for pawns cost him dearly. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas}
