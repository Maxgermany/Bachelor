[Opening "French (C16), Winawer, advance variation"]

1. e4 {This is an interesting variation of the French Winawer.  I forgot the correct move order at move 5 and thereafter was on my own as far as the opening was concerned.  I suspect my opponent was similarly left floundering...} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 Ne7 5. Qg4 {?  5. a3 is the book move.  I've played this opening dozens of times and I don't remember ever forgetting to play 5. a3 before Qg4.} c5 6. Qxg7 Rg8 7. Qxh7 Nbc6 8. Kd1 {White gives up castling to secure save his N from a fatal pin, strengthen his c-pawn and allow development of the kingside.  Other options were possibly 8. Qh3, 8. a3, 8. Ne2: but all had their disadvantages.} cxd4 9. Nce2 Nxe5 10. Nxd4 {Though a pawn up, White is badly behind in development and unable to castle.  Not good after only 10 moves!} Bd7 11. a3 Bc5 12. Ngf3 Bxd4 13. Nxd4 Ne5g6 {Now White's Queen is at risk... Only three squares to move to.} 14. Bg5 {This threatens 15. Qxg8+ Nxg8 16. Bxd8, winning the exchange} Rh8 {Now the Q has only one square.} 15. Qg7 Qb6 {Black forks b2 and d4 and prepares castling.} 16. b3 {Note that d4 is protected by White's Q :-)} Qd6 {Now Black attacks h2} 17. g3 O-O-O 18. Nb5 {Now that Black has castled, White wastes no time in preparing an attack, first forking the Q on d6 and the pawn on a7, while granting his Q access to c3 to deliver check.} Qb6 19. Qc3+ Kb8 20. Be3 {White spears a7 through the Black Queen.  The focus has swiftly transferred from the kingside.} Qc6 21. Bxa7+ Ka8 22. Qa5 {and now White prepares his mating net.  Note that 22....Qa6 does not defend effectively because of 23. Nc7+!} Rde8 23. Bb6+ Kb8 24. Qa7+ Kc8 25. Qa8# {}
