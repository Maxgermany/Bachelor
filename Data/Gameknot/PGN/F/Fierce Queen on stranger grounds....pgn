1. e4 Nc6 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {my usual setup in those days: play Italian no matter what; already better is d4, in this strange opening: Black hasn't played e5 yet...} Bg4 4. O-O {the first accident comes along: not paying very much real attention I automatically castled; better of course Bxf7+, Kxf7 (Kd7 induces d4!, threatening d5, Nb4, making room for Ne5+ in some future), Ng5+, and Qxg4... this gives Black time to repair all of this...} h6 5. h3 {better d4, Nf6, Bb5, d5, e5, Ne4, c3; but I wanted to get rid of the pin Bg4... although I tried Bxf7+ (see above) on occasions here, it is hardly to be recommended...} Bh5 6. g4 Bg6 7. d3 e6 8. Nh2 {just what I always plan in an Italian party; but this is no Italian: otherwise I would have played c3 a while ago...} h5 9. g5 {cramping off Nf6, and forcing the weaker Ne7 - f6 is always answered by f4: a very useful move, as we will soon learn......} Qd7 {preparing e5 and attack on h3...} 10. Qf3 {a clear mistake: usually I would have already played c3 here; that would have prevented Blacks' next strong opportunity... in this light, f4 was much better; but I didn't want to encourage e5 more than necessary...} Ne5 {luckily, he didn't consider Nd4, Qd1, d5, exd5, exd5, Re1+, Ne7 (remember that one), Bb3, Nxb3, axb3, with a clear advantage...} 11. Qe2 Nxc4 12. dxc4 O-O-O 13. Be3 Kb8 {playing things too safe... Bxe4! (Bxa7, Qc6!) might already win; for Black, that is... Whites' only advantage is development, for now...} 14. Nc3 a6 {sounder is e5, Kg2, f5...} 15. b4 {a bold move; better f4, Ne7, b4... but by this time, I noticed that Black was very reluctant against playing Ne7...} d5 16. exd5 exd5 {the second accident: White had better in c5, e5, exd5, or a3, Bd6, Rad1; Black however overlooks Bxb4!, with a lot of trouble for White..} 17. cxd5 Qxh3 {a crucial moment... after b5, Bd6 (of course), f4, a5, Qf3, (Rf3, Qd7), Qf5, Black holds all... so we gamble...} 18. Qf3 Qd7 {a small succes for White... after Qxf3, Nxf3, Bxb4, Bd4, f6!, gxf6, Nxf6 (finally Ng8 is released), Ne5, c5, Black is clearly better...} 19. b5 {and top it off with this; the plan is clear: reek havoc on the Q's side... I sensed mating possibilities...} a5 {another break for White, and Blacks' first real mistaken move; absolutely necessary was axb5... now White is unleashed...} 20. a4 f6 {of course, b6 was forced; but Black needed Ng8 to be elsewhere at the time real bad, and Ne7 was not appealing... now however, White gets to play b6, and Black will soon crumble...} 21. b6 Bd6 {cxb6, Nb5, Ka8 (against Qg3+), Bxb6, Rc8, Qg3, Ne7, Nc7+ is not nice; but this is worse...} 22. bxc7+ {we have no better than Nb5, Qf5 (Ka8, Nxd6, Qxd6, Rab1, cxb6, Bxb6, is winning), Qxf5, Bxf5, c4, with a tedious continuation... so we gamble again... } Bxc7 {better for Black was Qxc7, Qh3 (what else? Nb5, Bxh2+), and Ne7 finally...} 23. Nb5 Bxh2+ {Whites' enduring forcing play finally pays off: Black succumbs under the pressure; after Qxd5, Rad1, Qxf3, Nxf3, Ne7, Black holds the advantage... now he equalizes, into a lost position...} 24. Kxh2 f5 {missing where the real danger is coming from; even after Ka8, Qf4, Ne7, Qd4, Nc8, Qc3!, Black is running into mate soon...} 25. Qf4+ Kc8 {taking the merciful neck shot; also after Ka8, Qd4, all is over...} 26. Na7# {}
