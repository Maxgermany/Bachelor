1. d4 {I'm most comfortable with Queen's Pawn Gambit} d5 {Standard} 2. c4 {Queen's Pawn Gambit} Nf6 {Standard} 3. Bg5 {I'm always mixed on this move. It often ends badly for me.} dxc4 {Accepts the gambit one move later} 4. Bxf6 {I decided to double the pawns as I never get a lot of use out of my dark squared bishop anyway} gxf6 {I was surprised here as it destablizes an king side castle but keeps the king's pawn available for central control} 5. e4 {Take the center} e5 {Meets the move} 6. d5 {I thought the awkward pawn structure was worth keeping. I didn't want to trade queens nor did I like 6. ... exd4} Bb4+ {Developing with a check} 7. Nc3 {My only good move} Bxc3+ {This surprised me. I think it removes his good bishop and allows me a stronger pawn chain} 8. bxc3 {I'll take it} f5 {Trying to remove his doubled pawns} 9. exf5 {I thought this was better trying to protect my pawn} Bxf5 {Takes} 10. Bxc4 {Evens the game} Be4 {Putting pressure on my g pawn. } 11. Nf3 {Develop and relieve the pressure} Nc6 {A blunder I think} 12. dxc6 {Always take advantage} Bxc6 {Making the best of the blunder} 13. Qxd8+ {Up a piece I wanted to trade queens and also prevent any queen side castle} Rxd8 {forced} 14. Nxe5 {I thought about short castle but I wanted to keep the pressure on with a fork threat} O-O {Short castle anyway. I thought perhaps 14. ... Bxg2 was better although it ends up even material after 15. Nxf7 Bxh1 16. Nxd8} 15. Nxc6 {Get rid of the threat of Bxg2 now that my fork is gone. Doubles pawns, eliminates his last Bishop.} bxc6 {Takes} 16. O-O {Connect the rooks. I thinking just Rd1 hoping for a trade bring my other rook into play. I knew I had to remember back rank checks to which I've fallen victim in the past} Rd2 {Moving to the second rank which is always strong} 17. Rfe1 {Taking the open file} Rc2 {Threatening Rxc3} 18. Re3 {Protecting the pawn and thus the Bishop} Rb8 {Grabbing the open rank and threatening to connect rooks} 19. Rf3 {Keeping the c pawn protected and attacking his f pawn. } Rbb2 {Connecting and threating attacks along the 2nd rank} 20. Bb3 {Trapping his rook where it can't come to help against back rank attacks} Rcd2 {Getting on open file} 21. Rxf7 {Now threatening a discovered check} Kh8 {Running} 22. Re1 {Hoping for a back rank mate. Black's only move is Rd8 and then I start snapping up pawns} Kg8 {Overlooked back rank, I've done it myself more than once} 23. Re8# {I'm most comfortable with Queen's Pawn Gambit these days. This game hinged the blunder at move 11.}
