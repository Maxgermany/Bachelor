1. d4 {Following a nice plan in a Carlsbad pawn structure, helped me to get a couple of pawns material advantage, then some unfortunate piece placement by black allowed to increase the advantage and even exchange a queen for two rooks into a won endgame, black still tried some perpetual after a nice quiet move 31...g5 to open the h7-b1 diagonal, if my rook abandons the 1st rank, then black's queen would give check either on b1 or h7 and I could have had done nothing to prevent it, finally black blundered and allowed white to control h7 preventing the referred perpetual } d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 {Queen's gambit declined, exchange, Saemisch variation} 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3 Be7 7. Bd3 {so now we have a Carlsbad pawn structure white allows black's light squares bishop more freedom than he would usually has in the Queen’s Gambit Declined, but in return, white fixes the central pawn structure, has a half-open c-file, and a pawn-majority in the centre. From now on white has three possible plans for the middlegame:  a) castle queenside and attack black’s king by means of a pawn-storm b) make use of the central pawn majority, with Bd3, Qc2 and Nge2 c) make a minority attack by the advance of the b pawn hoping to create weaknesses in black's queen side  Black on the other side has some counter-play in form of a minority attack on king side with the pawn push f5-f4, or exploit white weaknesses on c4 and e4  I'll try "plan B", with an eye for a possible  swindle back to "plan A"} c6 8. Qc2 {now Nge2? would be a mistake, Qc2 is needed to hold e4 and threat h7} O-O 9. Nge2 {trying to use the central pawn majority, is a thematic approach to this Carlsbad pawns structure games, Nge2 instead of Nf3, allows some freedom to white's f pawn while still developing his last minor piece} Re8 10. O-O {castle for safety and to connect the rooks} Ne4 {another mistake, this move is only viable if white doesn't play Qc2, now black will lose a pawn, to increase white's pawn majority in the centre} 11. Bf4 {keeping the pieces on board} Ndf6 12. Nxe4 dxe4 13. Bxe4 {giving up the bishop pair for a pawn and a strong pawn majority on the centre of the board} Nxe4 14. Qxe4 Be6 {An interesting novelty, already tried were Bf6 and Qa5, both moves lead to wins by white, Black has a bishop pair and is playing a solid move developing his last piece to were it controls c4} 15. Rfd1 {to support the d pawn push if ever needed, also leaves the c column for the a rook, Nc3 will follow...} Bd5 16. Qd3 g5 {pointless, Bg3 also controls the h2-b8 column, and Ng3 wasn't an option I prefer Nc3} 17. Bg3 Bf6 18. Nc3 {after 15.Bd5 now 18.Nc3 wins a tempo and regains control over e4} Be6 {only move} 19. Ne4 {now two ideas for white to get back a bishop for a knight depriving black of his bishop pair, although not my preferential bishop as we would end up with opposit colours bishops, and to play Nd6 forking the rook and b7} Bg7 {black opts to keep both bishops on board} 20. Nd6 {so again "plan B" Now I expect Re7 Nf5 with another fork this time on bishop and rook} Rf8 21. Nxb7 Qb6 {the idea must be Qxb2 but b2 is tactically protected, by the move Qdb1(!) which wins the queen } 22. Nc5 {again the threat to exchange the knight by a bishop, now with two pawns advantage} Rfe8 23. Nxe6 Rxe6 24. Rdc1 {hitting both c6 and the square c5} Rd8 {this move by black gave me some ideas: is maybe possible to consolidate the position and try then the clearance of the c column to play Bc7 with a fork on rook and queen } 25. h4 {first step of the wanted consolidation to open an escape from back rank mate to my king} g4 {I expected gxh4, but now I can at least win a pawn} 26. Qf5 Rg6 27. h5 {inviting black to exchange his rooks for my queen, or to play Re6 and lose yet another pawn with no compensation} Rd5 28. Qxd5 cxd5 29. Rc8+ {a zwischenzug to force the pin of the bishop which guarantees white's advantage} Bf8 30. hxg6 {and now the second rook} hxg6 31. Rac1 {doubling rooks on c column protects the c8 rook and threats to bring the final rook in to the fight} g5 {! Nice quiet move to try some perpetual shifting the queen between b1 and h7} 32. Rb8 {opens c8 for the c1 rook with tempo} Qg6 {I didn't see this coming until g5, } 33. Rd8 {now the c1 rook is tied to the defence of the back rank, so its a virtual B+R vs Q endgame, as black also has the bishop pinned... the idea behind this move is to get to d6 with the bishop} Kg7 {? bad as it allows white to win the bishop Be5+ Kg8 Bd6 ...Bxd6 or Be5+ f6 to block the bishop check Rc7 and now black doesn't have any perpetual as the c7 rook controls h7} 34. Be5+ f6 35. Rc7+ Kg8 36. Bd6 {and the bishop falls}
