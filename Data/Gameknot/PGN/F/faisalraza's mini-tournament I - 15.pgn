1. d4 {my pawns advanced in the centre of the board conditioned blacks mobility, then and well timed attack on the castled king allowed me to win an exchange and one pawn, after which I exchanged as many material as possible to reach an 2R vs R+N endgame that was easily decided by my passed pawn on the a column} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {Nimzo-Indian defence (E20)} d5 4. Nf3 c6 5. e3 Bb4 6. Bd3 Nbd7 7. Qc2 h6 8. O-O O-O 9. Bd2 {until this move I'v found 14 games (11 w / 0 l / 3 d), black tried several moves but was never able to win!} Be7 {N here I can try cxd5 to transpose for a Carlsbad pawn structure, My dark squares bishop is behind my pawns, and my knight is placed in front of the f pawn, so an f pawn push is hard to get now, black has no weakness in his camp just a closed in light squares bishop, with a Carlsbad structure he will have that solved for him, plus is not certain black will recapture with the e pawn, he can also recapture with the c pawn and with the knight transposing in to a slav pawn formation..., or e4 an uncommitted move to let him decide were would I move next, plus I'll be threatening e5... } 10. e4 {I'm trying to get my pawn to e5, black shouldn't allow this or his castled king would be in trouble} dxc4 11. Bxc4 {we've reached a Slav pawn formation, now I need to eventually play e5 to stop black from playing it and also to vacate the b1-h7 diagonal} Nb6 12. Bb3 {with this manoeuvre I can get the light bishop behind my queen and threaten mate on h7, but first e5 is in order} Ne8 13. e5 {e5 to open the b1-h7 diagonal and add further restriction to black's pieces} Nc7 {to control d5, but now the action already shifted to the king's wing and black has to hasten  his defence, or get mated} 14. Qd3 Nbd5 15. Bc2 {and here it is my bishop behind my queen and a threat black can't ignore} f5 16. exf6 e.p. {I can now destroy black's castle} Nxf6 17. Bxh6 {with the idea gxh6 Qg6+ Kh8 Qxh6+ and bring in the knights for a complete offensive} Ncd5 18. Qg6 {threatens Qxg7++ and wins a quality} Rf7 {forced} 19. Ng5 {threatens Qxf7 Kh8 Qxg7++, so black is forced to protect the rook with the queen} Qf8 20. Nxf7 {wins the quality} Qxf7 21. Nxd5 {now in advantage I'll exchange material, if Qxg6 then Nxe7 forks the Queen and King, then Kf7 Bxg6+ Kxe7 Bxg7 wins another pawn and keeps the bishop pair} exd5 22. Qxf7+ {exchanging material, and after Kxf7 Bg5 pins the knight and blocks the g pawn} Kxf7 23. Bg5 {to pin the knight} Be6 24. Rfe1 {the idea is to try and play Bg6+ Kxg6 Rxg6 Rxe6 and leave black the option of exchanging the dark squares bishop also} Bd6 25. Bg6+ {I'll still have the chance to exchange bishops and if black plays Bxh2+ I'll play latter Re7 with a double attack on b7 and g7, wining back the lost h pawn} Kxg6 26. Rxe6 Bxh2+ 27. Kxh2 {expected now after the forced Kxg5, I'll play Re7 attacking g7 and b7} Kxg5 28. Re7 g6 29. Rxb7 {wins back the lost pawn (26...Bxh2+) and limits somehow black's available moves, as he can't move the rook right away from a8, unless to give an unconsequent check} Ne4 30. Kg1 {to support f2 and back away from the open h column, now I need to consolidate my position before moving on to attack, also Rc7 may not be a bad move...} Rf8 31. f3 {opens a hole on g3 but black can't do nothing with it: Ng3 (with the idea Rh8-h1+) Rxa7 (wins another pawn) Rh8 Kf2 is safe enough} Ng3 32. Rxa7 {loses another pawn, but he can get one of mine in exchange} Ne2+ 33. Kf2 Nxd4 {and he does just that, grabs a pawn} 34. Rc7 Kf5 35. a4 {now I'll advance my a pawn to get the king to come to the queen's wing or to get one of black's pieces committed to block  it} Rb8 36. Ra2 {Rb1? with Rb6-a6 and Nb3 black can solve some of his problems and threats Nd2 to win the b pawn} Ke6 {black's king is rushing back to the other wing...} 37. a5 g5 {? facilitates my task after exchanging rooks, because black is already late to block my a pawn, I'll get my king to the g column to grab the g pawn that now is closer} 38. a6 Kd6 39. a7 {surly black expected Rg7 Ne6, but now, I'll sacrifice a pawn to get rid of black's rook, his counter-play will be greatly diminished, next I'll grab the g pawn, and will advance my g and f pawns, while black's king is away from them} Ra8 40. Rb7 {It's a pity after Kxc7 I had a surprise axb8=B+!? and black should capture...} Nb5 41. b4 d4 42. Ra6 {pins the c6 pawn, so threatens Rxb5} Kd5 43. Rb8 {If Rxb8 axb8=Q If Rxa7 Rxb5+ wins the rook next move If Nxa7 Rxa8 enters an 2R vs N endgame} Rxa7 44. Rxb5+ Kc4 {}
