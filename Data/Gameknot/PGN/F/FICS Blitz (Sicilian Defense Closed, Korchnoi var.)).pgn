1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 Qc7 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 a6 6. g3 b5 7. Bg2 Bb7 8. a3 {To prevent b4 and White is forced to what seems an awkward Knight retreat.  Our database seems to suggest that castling is fine and the text clearly wastes time.} Nf6 {Assault on the King's pawn.  White's position is already a little off.} 9. O-O Bc5 10. Nde2 O-O 11. Nf4 {Looking for some counter-play.  If Black is drawn into 11. ... e5 then White can reestablish himself with 12. Nd5.} Qe5 12. Re1 Nc6 {Cuts off the Bishop's attack on the King's pawn, which had been preventing the massacre that follows.  I am unsure what Black's better option was.} 13. Nd3 Qd6 14. e5 Nxe5 15. Bxb7 {White gets a little over-eager.  15. Nxe5 and Black must trade Queens (leaving White in control on the Queen's file, no less) or retreat and White has his tempo back with the gain of a piece for a pawn.  The text leads to chaos.} Nxd3 16. Qxd3 Qb6 17. Bxa8 Bxf2+ 18. Kh1 Bxe1 19. Be3 Qb8 20. Rxe1 Qxa8+ 21. Kg1 {White, in the final reckoning, traded a minor piece for two pawns.  He has moderately better development, but his Queen looks vulnerable and his pawn structure is non-existent.  His only chance is to push the Queen-side (where he has a pawn majority by some miracle) hard and fast, but the Knight is in the way.} d5 22. Bc5 Re8 23. b3 Qc6 24. Bd4 Ng4 25. h3 Nh6 26. g4 f5 27. g5 Nf7 28. h4 e5 29. Bxe5 {Retreating the bishop was in order because of the placement of White's King and Rook.} Nxe5 30. Qxd5+ Qxd5 31. Nxd5 {Just as planned! - except White overlooked the incoming fork.} Nf3+ {White resigns.  A messy game all around.  While I made significant mistakes (not least entering the final combination instead of retreating) it was a fairly even game.}
