1. e4 {This game ends in one of my extremely rare draws. Both sides had chances but in the end it was obviously a draw.} c5 2. c3 {One of my favorite anti sicilian lines against better players, Less likely to focus on book knowledge.} d5 {An attempt to exploit Whites having blocked Nc3.} 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. d4 {Otherwise Black gets control of the center and an active Q.} cxd4 5. cxd4 {The pawn is isolated but White has compensation in development potential.} Nc6 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. Nc3 Qd6 {?! Up to this point, book. Here GK suggests  7...Qf5 8. d5 Bxf3 9. gxf3 Ne5 10. Bb5+ Nd7 11. Be3 Ngf6 12. Rc1 a6 13. Bd3 Qh5 14. O-O Nxd5 15. Nxd5 Qxd5 with only a slight edge for White.} 8. Be2 {GK prefers 8. d5 Ne5 9. Bb5+ Bd7 10. Bxd7+ Nxd7 11. O-O Ngf6 12. Bg5 Qb4 13. Qc2 Nc5 14. Rfe1 O-O-O 15. Ne5 Nxd5 16. Qf5+ Kb8 17. Nxd5 Rxd5, rating white +1.25. But I was concerned about the pin.} e6 9. d5 exd5 10. O-O Nf6 11. Nb5 Qd7 {?! GK considers this an error, suggesting 11 … Qb8 12. Nfd4 Bd7 13. Bd3 Nxd4 14. Nxd4 Bd6 15. Re1+ Ne4 16. Qh5 O-O 17. Qxd5 Nc5 18. Bc4 Bxh2+ 19. Kh1 when the game is essentially even,} 12. Bf4 {I was feeling good about my prospects here. White has an advantage, but can I keep it?} Rc8 13. Ne5 Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Bxe2 15. Qxe2 Be7 16. Bxf6 {This move was in the GK World database, and I liked the resulting position. } gxf6 17. Nxa7 {So far, this position is still in the GK World database, and it shows White as having the advantage. } Ra8 18. Nb5 O-O {It turns out Black's King is not a weak as I would have thought.} 19. Qd3 Bc5 {Unexpectedly strong. I thought that with the broken pawn structure Black would fear the ending. But that was not the case.} 20. Nd4 {Again, I wanted to get to an ending.} Bxd4 21. Qxd4 Ra6 {! Very effective. While White has to be better (as GK computer indicates), Black has become slightly more active than White. } 22. a3 {Necessary to free the rook and block play on the a file.} Re8 {Well played. As weak as Black's pawns look, I am not able to see how to make much progress.} 23. Rad1 Rd6 24. Rd2 {?! This is too timid. Rd3 is better. I thought I could play in later but Black is becoming more active.} Re4 {A fine move! Black is using activity to compensate for pawn weaknesses.} 25. Qd3 f5 26. Rfd1 {I keep thinking that putting pressure on the d pawn will help me find a plan.} Qe6 {?! GK does not like this move. It suggests … d4 27. Rc2 Qe7 28. Rf1 Kg7 29. h3 Rd5 30. b4 Ree5 31. g3 b5 32. Rfc1 Re1+ 33. Rxe1 Qxe1+ 34. Kh2, further cramping White's position, with essential equality. } 27. h3 {But it works psychologically, since I am playing more cautiously, and fear ...Rg4 if I play Qg3+, thus the proactive h3. Instead of this move, after which White has no real advantage, GK suggests 27. Qg3+ Kh8 28. f3 Re5 29. Qh4 f6 30. a4 Rc6 31. a5 Rc4 32. Qh6 Rc8 33. g3 Qc6 34. f4 Qc5+ 35. Rd4, with advantage to White. } Re1+ 28. Kh2 Rxd1 29. Rxd1 Qe5+ 30. Qg3+ {Again, I still think I have a won ending. While I do have an advantage, it isn't as great as I thought.} Qxg3+ 31. Kxg3 Kg7 32. Kf4 Kf6 33. Rd2 h6 {! A good plan. Keeping White out.} 34. a4 {Now I am still struggling for a plan to win rather than draw, at the obvious risk of losing. I thought I could mobilize my Q side pawn majority. } Ke6 35. Rd4 {This is the beginning of an aggressive plan. I knew Rooks belong behind pawns but had visions of infiltrating on the Q side.} Rc6 36. Rb4 b6 37. f3 Rd6 38. Rd4 Rc6 39. b4 {? GK considers this a blunder. I still have the advantage, and had a flawed idea that I could advance the pawns now and then get behind a passed pawn with my rook. But GK suggests first 39. g3 Rc8 40. Ke3 Rg8 41. Rb4 Rxg3 42. Kd4 Rxh3 43. Rxb6+ Ke7 44. Kxd5 Rxf3 45. b4 h5 46. a5 Rd3+ 47. Ke5 h4 48. Kxf5 Rd5+ 49. Ke4. The point is that it is a move order issue, White could prepare in order to be able to move the K.} Rc2 40. g3 {? Ironically the best move a move ago, GK considers this weak because it gives Black too much play. If I was going to proceed with my plan I needed to be bold and play consistently with 40. a5 Rxg2 41. axb6 Rg8 42. b5 Rb8 43. Ke3 Rxb6 44. Rb4 Kd6 45. Kd4 Rb7 46. Rb3 Rb6 47. f4 h5, with some advantage.} Ra2 41. b5 Rh2 42. h4 Rc2 43. Rb4 Ra2 {Now Black has full equality, perhaps a very slight edge. But White still is trying for a win. } 44. g4 {This move does not help White but it is an attempt to win (or lose).} fxg4 45. fxg4 Kf6 46. g5+ hxg5+ 47. hxg5+ Ke6 48. Kg4 {? The King isn't going anywhere. I was trying too hard to win. GK suggests 48. Kf3 Ra3+ 49. Ke2 Ke5 50. Rh4 d4 51. Rh7 Rg3 52. Rh6 d3+ 53. Kd2 Rxg5 54. Rxb6 Ke4 55. a5 Rg2+ 56. Kc3 Rc2+ 57. Kb3 Ke3 with drawish prospects.} Ke5 49. Rf4 Rg2+ 50. Kf3 Rxg5 51. Rxf7 Kd6 52. Rb7 {Again another overaggressive plan, which risks losing a drawish game. Best is simply 52. Rf6+ Kc5 53. Rc6+ Kb4 54. Rxb6 Kxa4 55. Rb8 Rg6 56. Kf4 Ka5 57. Ke5 Rb6 58. Ra8+ Kxb5 59. Kxd5 Rh6 60. Ra1 Rh5+ 61. Ke6 Rh6+ 62. Kd5. } Kc5 53. Ke3 Rg4 {? Here Black misses a possible win with … Rg3+ 54. Kf4 Ra3 55. Rc7+ Kb4 56. Ke5 Kxa4 57. Kxd5 Kxb5 58. Rc2 Rd3+ 59. Ke4 Rd1 60. Rc7 Rd2 61. Ke3 Ra2 62. Rd7 Rc2 63. Rb7 Rc1. Again, White has played too much for a win.} 54. Ra7 Rg3+ {A move later, White has better defensive prospects.} 55. Kd2 Ra3 56. Kc2 Kb4 57. Ra6 Rxa4 58. Rxb6 Kc5 59. Rb8 Rb4 {White is now struggling to draw. } 60. Kd3 {? But this does not help. GK suggests after 60. Kd3 Rb3+ 61. Kc2 Rxb5 62. Rc8+ Kd4 63. Ra8 Rb7 64. Ra6 Rc7+ 65. Kd2 Rg7 66. Ra4+ Ke5 67. Ra8 Rg2+ 68. Kd3 Rg3+ 69. Kd2 d4 70. Ra7. A similar plan, with 60. Kc3 Rxb5 61. Rc8+ Kd6 62. Rd8+ Ke7 63. Ra8 Rb1 64. Ra6 Rd1 65. Rg6 Kd7 66. Rh6 Kc7 67. Rh8 Rb1 68. Rf8 Kc6 69. Rf7 Rb7 70. Rxb7, offers excellent drawing prospects. } Rb3+ 61. Kd2 Rxb5 {!? This is essentially a concession the game will be drawn.} 62. Rxb5+ Kxb5 63. Kd3 {! Now White has a draw but they have to play carefully. The rest of the ending is instructive for beginners on how to draw despite being down a pawn from this kind of position. Both players play it out for that purpose.} Kc5 64. Kc3 {Always maintain the opposition, if the King ever gets in front of the pawn it will Queen.} d4+ 65. Kd3 {The right move, Black must now protect the pawn.} Kd5 66. Kd2 {Again, maintain the opposition. } Kc4 67. Kc2 {Once again Black must retreat or advance the pawn.} Kd5 68. Kd3 Ke5 69. Ke2 {White is maintaining the opposition. } Ke4 70. Kd2 Ke5 71. Kd3 Kd5 72. Kd2 Kc4 73. Kc2 {Black can't make progress.} d3+ {Advances the pawn, and the same pattern repeats itself.} 74. Kd2 Kd4 75. Kd1 {The key move. White can oppose Black's king. } Kc3 76. Kc1 d2+ {Only way to progress, but...} 77. Kd1 {Now the game is declared drawn. Either Black stalemates or loses the pawn, a draw in either case. Moral of the game for beginners is if you are too aggressive in trying to win, you risk fighting for a draw at best. Also instructive for beginners is how Black compensated for pawn structure weaknesses that were not as severe as one would think with activity. A draw was a fitting result.}
