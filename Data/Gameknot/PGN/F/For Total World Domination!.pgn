[Opening "Blackmar gambit (D00)"]

1. d4 {A40 Queen's Pawn Opening. The Queen's Pawn opening move is somewhat slower than the popular e4, because White will not be able to castle for three more moves. Its advantage is that it gives White more control over tactical surprises and often provides more lasting initiative and pressure.} d5 {D00 Queen's Pawn Game 1.d4 d5. Black answers symmetrically, challenging the center directly.} 2. e4 {D00 Blackmar Diemer Gambit. This might be called the true Queen's Gambit - the Blackmar-Diemer. It's full of traps.} e5 {Out of Opening Book. dxe4 would have been in the Blackmar Diemer Gambit opening line. Slightly better is dxe4.} 3. dxe5 c6 4. exd5 cxd5 {White wins two pawns for a pawn. White is up a pawn in material.} 5. Bb5+ {Checks Black's king.} Nd7 {Removes the threat on Black's king.} 6. Qxd5 {Pins Black's pawn at b7. White wins a pawn. White is up two pawns.} Bb4+ {Checks White's king.} 7. c3 {Protects White's king and attacks Black's bishop at b4.} Ba5 8. Bxd7+ {This was white's only serious miscue, but white was able to stay close and eventually mated.} Bxd7 {Disengages the pin on Black's pawn at b7 and removes the threat on Black's king. Black wins a bishop for a knight.} 9. Nf3 {Enables the short castle.} g5 {Justin's note:  I think you were doing fine up until this move.. pretty much moved it out there for me to take it without being able to really protect it. Possible better move options: Ne7 to cover your king & attack my queen.. or Bc6 to attack my queen(possibly swap queens) or Qc7 to unpin your bishop protecting your queen if you wanted to not swap queens} 10. Nxg5 {Threatens checkmate (queen captures pawn at f7) and isolates Black's pawn at f7 and Black's pawn at h7.} h6 {Black moves into a forced mate. Much better is Be6.  h6 leads to QxF7# and mate. This move was black's fatal mistake. White followed the mating combination to win the game.} 11. Qxf7# {Checkmates Black's king.}
