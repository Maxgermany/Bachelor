1. d4 {QG opening.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 {Queen's gambit accepted!  Actually not used to this...} 3. e4 {Assert centre control, the point of the gambit...  In response to comments by sarasani and sicilianunleash, it is true that I was not particularly concerned about 3... b5.  In that case, I would have responded 4. a4 c6 5.b3 (not 5. axb5), or possibly 4.a4 a6? 5.axb5, if I got the chance.} Qd6 {Qd6?  Why move the Queen out?  Becomes a potential target.} 4. Bxc4 {Recapture the pawn, assert stronger centre control} Qb4+ {Qb4 ?  Why?  Attempting to grab the bishop?  Easily defended.  And from here, I can start developing with tempo.} 5. Nd2 {Defensive, but the Queen is vulnerable. } Nc6 {Not bad.  Attempt to regain centre control since the pawn is not protected by the Queen anymore.} 6. Ngf3 {But again, easily defended.} g6 {Setting up the fianchetto, with idea to move ...Bg7.} 7. a3 {So let me get the Queen out of here, and develop my pieces} Qa5 {Backs up the Queen.  I do not want to move b4, since 8.b4 Nxb4 loses a pawn, or worse, for me.} 8. O-O {Castle my King to get rid of that annoying pin.} Nf6 {Not sure why this play.  Blocks in Bg7, also the Knight on d2 is no longer pinned.} 9. Nb3 {As seen here.  Of course, this exposes my pawn on e4, which I regretted later.} Qh5 {Moves Queen to Kingside, which is where my King is now.  Also, Queen is less exposed to my pieces, which for the moment, are all Queenside.} 10. Bf4 {Desiring here to gain dominant centre control.  However, overlooked vulnerable pawn on e4.} Nxe4 {Takes the pawn.  Overall though, I have slightly better centre control, and black's queen is still exposed.} 11. Qe2 {Attack the Knight.} f5 {Why?  The Queen is limited in space she can go, and is not really a threat here.  Why not Bf4, developing a more mobile piece, and freeing up the rook on a8, to move to half-open d file.} 12. Rad1 {Take advantage of space to move to half-open file.  Coming down the centre.} h6 {?  Not sure why.  Presumably to stop Bg5.} 13. Be5 {But I wasn't going there.  Now castling become harder.  Also, by tempting the Knight away, the d file becomes open, so my Rook on d1 is now worth more.  Still, right here, my dark bishop is currently worth more than his Knight on c6, so this isn't a bad play, really.  Besides, my bishop is obviously threatening his rook, and his options are either give up right to castle, or kill the bishop.} Nxe5 {Now, when I take with dxe5, my rook has access through all of d-file.} 14. dxe5 {Like so.} e6 {Good job.  Blocks in my pawn, prevents my white bishop from offering a threat in case black wants to castle.  However, further blocks in black's white bishop.  From here on, black is on the defensive.} 15. Qd3 {Threatening Qd8 , which would have actually been a bad idea.  After 16. Qd8   Kf7, my Queen would have had few places to go.  Still, this would pin his bishops, potentially.  Note that 16. Qd8   Kf7, 17.Qf6  would lead to disaster for me.  Anyway, getting my forces ready for a move down the centre.} Be7 {Not bad defensive move.  Now, I can't do Qd8 .  I have to get rid of one of these bishops, is what I'm thinking here.} 16. Nbd4 {Here I was thinking of 17. Nd4xe6, with an idea to lure out the white bishop, or possibly 17.Bxe6 to force the white bishop out.  This wouldn't have been too bad, as 17.Bxe6 Bxe6 18.Nx36 would have allowed me to move Qd7 , barricading in the King.  Wonder what would have happened if I did that?} b6 {But now this allows me to threaten the black bishop.  I would prefer to move my Queen to the back rank directly anyway.} 17. Nc6 {Eyes on black's dark bishop.} Nd6 {Threatens my bishop here, but more importantly, blocks my access to the d-file.  I definitely do not want to take the Knight here, since 18.exd6 cxd6 means this file is pretty much closed to me.} 18. Nxe7 {Death to the black bishop!} Nxc4 {At this point, who cares about the white bishop?  The file is open, so I take it.} 19. Qd8+ Kf7 {Only place to move, I have to do something about that rook.} 20. Qxh8 {Gotta do it.} Kxe7 {White bishop is still pinned, the King has minimal access here.  My King is nice and safe, and the black Queen is still stuck.  Goodbye Knight, you served me well.} 21. Qf6+ {Best play at the moment.  Conversely, I suppose I could have done Qd8 , but that would have led to repetition.  This way, the King is barricaded in.} Ke8 {And it's all over from here.} 22. Rd8# {Really enjoyed this game.}
