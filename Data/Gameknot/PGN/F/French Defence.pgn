[Opening "French (C13), Albin-Alekhine-Chatard attack"]

1. e4 {Here is a short French Alekhine-Chatard attack finished recently.  There are some interesting educational themes in this game.  The attack against solitary king, the trapped piece and weaknesses in the castled position.  Feel free to leave comments.} e6 {The French is a counter-punching opening.  A favorite of mine in the recent past, I now exclusively play 1...c5.} 2. d4 {White opts for the main line French instead of the Kings Indian Attack with 2. d3.} d5 {The central counter-strike.} 3. Nc3 {The Classical set up against the French is probably the most testing.  White avoids extending the center with 3. e5 and prepares to develop actively with 4. Bg5, among others.} Nf6 {Another very interesting possiblity is 3...Nc6!?, which transposes to a line of the Nimzowitch, also known as the Hecht-Reefshlager.} 4. Bg5 {Another interesting line is the Modern Classical with 4. e5 Nfd7; 5 Nce2!?} Be7 {Breaking the pin.} 5. e5 {This is a typical strategy for the Classical French.  White wants to exchange his bad dark-squared bishop for Black's good bishop.  This will leave Black with the problem light-squared bishop to deal with, while White's light-squared bishop will find an active role to play very early.} Nfd7 {5...Ne4 is dubious.} 6. h4 {An interesting move that offers a pawn to start an immediate attack on the Black kingside.  In the days of romanticism, where gambits were always accepted, this led to some spectacular defeats for the second player.  Today, with defensive technique much stronger, this variation is almost extinct.} Bxg5 {The best way to refute a gambit.} 7. hxg5 {White hopes the open h-file will help him to attack the Black kingside.  Of course, only someone with a deathwish would castle kingside at this point.} Qxg5 { } 8. Nf3 {8. Nh3 is interesting, intending to play a later Nf4, when sacrificial possibilities (especially on d5) abound.} Qe7 {This keeps the queen available for the defense of the kingside if needed.} 9. Bd3 {Immediately targeting the pawn on h6, but this is of no consequence as Black should continue developing and wait for White to commit his king before castling himself.} Nc6 {Not 9...c5, when 10. Nb5 is annoying.} 10. a3 {White wants to keep the bishop on d3 without the ...Nb4 swat, however, this move weakens the White king's soon-to-be shelter.  Notice on move 16 how this weakness will become the target of my attack.} Nb6 {c4 will make a nice outpost for my knight.} 11. Qe2 {Preparing to castle queenside.  11. Qd2 would amount to a fairly similar game, however, the White queen would have the option of coming to f4 after both sides had castled.} Bd7 {Developing another piece and waiting for White to castle.} 12. O-O-O {White has to commit sometime.  He would never be able to undertake any effective plan with the kings in the center.} O-O-O {We are now pretty clearly in the middle game and the respective plans are shaping up.  After 13. Kb1, White will play on the kingside with Rh3 and Rdh1, followed by an advance of the g- and f-pawns.  Black will blow out his castled position in an attempt to get at the White king.  An interesting battle is set to ensue.} 13. Rxh7 {Although, this just gets the light-squared bishop trapped.  Now the plan becomes easier.  While White tries to extricate his piece, I will work on the king.} Rxh7 { } 14. Bxh7 { } g6 {White is effectively down a piece.} 15. Qe3 {Attempting to bring the Queen to assist in the extrication, but this allows...} Nc4 {a smooth landing with tempo.} 16. Qh6 {Two of White's pieces have abandoned the king.  I have the ability to bring my bishop to a4 and my other knight to c4 via a5.  I decide it's time to strike.} Nxa3 {I don't think this this wins by force, but White responds badly.} 17. Qg7 {??  I had analysed 17. bxa3 Qxa3 ; 18. Kd2 Na5; 19. Ne2 Qb4 ; 20. c3 Qb2 ; 21. Ke1 Ba4, when I have two pawn and a huge initiative, which is more than enough to give Black the advantage, but the game is not over.} Nc4 {Preparing ...Qb4 and a final assault on the White position.} 18. Rh1 {Removing another piece from the defense.  White can stop the Black queen from invading on b4 with 18. Nb1! and if now 18...Qb4?!; 19. b3 and it doesnt seem to me that Black's attack is going anywhere.  Black can improve with 18...Nb4, when I'm still better.} Qb4 {White is lost now.} 19. Nd1 {White has to give up a ton of material to stay alive for a few more moves.} Qa4 {Mate on a1 is threatened.} 20. c3 {Mate is forced now.} Qa1+ { } 21. Kc2 { } Nc6xe5 {Clearing the way for the light-squared bishop to enter the attack.} 22. Nxe5 {22. dxe5 amounts to the same thing after 22...Ba4 .} Ba4+ { } 23. Kd3 { } Bxd1 { } 24. Nxc4 {24. Rxd1 prolongs the inevitable for a few more moves.} Qb1+ { } 25. Kd2 { } Qc2+ { } 26. Ke3 { } Qe4+ { } 27. Kd2 { } Qe2+ { } 28. Kc1 { } Qc2# {Thanks to my opponent.}
