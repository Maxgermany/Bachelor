1. e4 {this game started more than three months ago, and this must be one of the reasons I truly and utterly hate correspondence chess; especially at 5 days per move... mind you, at this rate a player earns an extra day per week over the weekend, to prevent you from timing out over the weekend; like all players who are liable to time out on Friday... this player decides to use them all up; avoid these players, if you can: they try to make you lose out of boredom...} c5 {at the time - january 14 - I was rated 1836 against 1625; this game was just supposed to be a quick in-between to earn some points... I was pretty confident in this opening...} 2. c4 {at this point, I was sure to win this game... this will lock out the development of Bf1...} g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. d3 e6 5. Nf3 Ne7 6. Be2 {leaving Black too much play... d4 or Be3 were best...} O-O 7. O-O {same here...} d5 {as always the plan...} 8. Bd2 Nbc6 9. a3 b6 {Black has taken over control; a bit better was cxd5, exd5, Rc1...} 10. Bg5 {a weak move... White had no better than Rb1, dxe4, dxe4, Nd4, Nxd4, cxd4, Na2...} d4 11. Na4 e5 12. b3 Qd6 13. h3 {probably already the losing move... better was Re1, Nd8, Bd2...} Nd8 14. Nh2 {also a bad choice; better Re1, Ne6, Bd2, Re8, Rb1...} Ne6 15. Bh4 {better Bd2...} Bd7 16. Bg4 f5 17. exf5 Nxf5 18. Bxf5 gxf5 19. g3 {the final mistake... only Re1, Bc6, Bg3, was still playable...} e4 20. Nb2 {this otherwise dead Knight was played, two months in the game; halfway March...} Bc6 21. f3 {better Qh5, a6, Rfe1...} Bf6 22. Qe1 Rae8 {not paying attention, probably out of being bored to death... immediately Bxh4, gxh4, Nf4!, Kh1, Kh8 is winning on the spot...} 23. Bxf6 Rxf6 24. dxe4 Ng5 25. e5 Rxe5 26. Qd2 Nxh3+ 27. Kg2 {losing swifter than Kh1, Rfe6, Qg2, Re2, Qxh3, Rxb2...} Rg6 28. Kh1 Re3 29. Nd3 {not much better was g4, fxg4, or Qg2, Rxg3...} Qxg3 {three months in the game; 29 moves in 96 days amounts to 3.31 days per move, which is not bad after all... only Ne5 - to knock out Bc6, and cover for f3 - may help... follows Rxe5, and back to Re3; mate is soon in the air... main treath is Rxf3, Nxf3, Bxf3+... in this position, White timed out; in vacation mode, so he gets 5 days extra... right...} 30. Nb2 {another useless move, after nearly ten days...} Rxf3 {there we go... Nxf3 (Rxf3?, Qg1+!!, Rxg1, Rxg1#), Bxf3+, Rxf3, Qxf3+, Kh2, Nf4... then what?} 31. Nxf3 Bxf3+ {White resigned; after Rxf3, Qxf3+, Kh2, Nf4, follows mate in one in all variations... this game took 107 days to complete 31 moves, a 10 days vacation postponement and a couple of near timeouts; I am glad my opponent did not force me to mate him, because that would have taken another 10 boring days and maybe even more...}
