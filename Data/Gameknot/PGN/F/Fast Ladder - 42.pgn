1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Giuoco Piano} 4. O-O {White gets his King to safety fast, which is reasonable, but I would first develop Queen side more.} Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 6. a3 {A waste of time, given that he is not continuing with 7. b4. There are no immediate threats on b4, while the QB is still undeveloped. } Bg4 7. d3 {Development of both sides is almost complete.} Nd4 {This position is dangerous for White: Black's Bishop and Knight are aiming at the pinned Nf3.} 8. Bg5 {White responds with a similar pin.} Qd7 {Unpinning and getting ready to castle Queenside.} 9. Bxf6 gxf6 {I don't mind doubled pawns since I am going to castle to the other side.} 10. Nd5 {I have totally overlooked this move. It threatens 11. Nxf6+ with a royal fork. I can not defend f6 with 10. ..Qe6 because of a discovered attack Nxc7+ Kd7 Bxe6 and 10. ..Qe7 fails instantly to Nxf7. The only way to save the Queen is Qd8, but it is followed by Nxf6+ and my Bishop on g4 falls. I decide that my bishop is more useful that my Queen and go forward with my attack of Nf3 assisted with a window on g7 that helps to actifate the Kingside Rook.} Nxf3+ {White cannot retake with his Queen for obvious reasons.} 11. gxf3 Bh3 12. Nxf6+ {Greedy for my Queen, he does not see a mate in 3.} Ke7 13. Nxd7 Rhg8+ 14. Kh1 Bg2+ 15. Kg1 Bxf3# {}
