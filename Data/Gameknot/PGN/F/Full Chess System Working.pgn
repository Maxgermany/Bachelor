1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bg5 c5 4. e3 h6 5. Bh4 cxd4 6. Nxd4 {So far, it has just been the opening theory. Both players have been following the main opening goals and now white ventures away from the general line with 6.exd4. At the point when we get out of book, we need to be very careful, and think how we will best complete our opening goals. Well, it is actually quite simple: Nc6, d5, Bd6/e7/c5, 0-0, and black is fine. This completes the tasks fast and gives black a good activity. So we have a way of following the principle of maximum acitivity as well as completing our goal.} Nc6 7. Nxc6 {(?!)It is quite a dubious idea; If you have read my previous games you may know why. The principle of pressure, and important principle, states that you should keep the pressure when 2 pieces are in contact(They are the same pieces) unless you can have a tactic. If there is no tactical manuever, it is almost always giving your opponent the advantage, since it lets them get more active. The only exception is when you take and force a piece backwards, but that is also to some extent a dynamic benefit :). } bxc6 {Now we see: Black has a better center, and his rook is suddenly active. So black has at least equalized the opening.} 8. Bd3 d5 9. O-O Rb8 {Black's rook is active, the center is strong, and white has done it for black himself.} 10. b3 Bd6 11. Nd2 Qc7 {The computer thinks this is a mistake, due to the white's next reply. However, this move is totally fine, and is actually the best move possibly. The computer's general understanding of a position is terrible; it overvalues material and does not understand psychology. For example, the computer is never afraid, since computers don't know what "fear" is.} 12. Bxf6 {White makes a weak move. This move once again violates the principle of pressure again. The reasons are a bit different. However, we can see that the capture gives away the stronger white bishop for the less effective black knight. It more importantly opens lines towards the white king. Such a move cannot be strong. Instead, white could easily do 12.Nf3, with the principle of the least active piece. } gxf6 13. Qh5 {A very reasonable move; The maximum activity. White has now completed his opening tasks and is ready for the middlegame. Before, we had NO NEED to calculate any variations really. The only calculation we needed to do was the safety check when considering ideas. Even then, it was very brief. We really did not even need to use our full thought process, since we planned out our ideas, and they were obvious and followed the correct principles. However, now we will need to use our thought process, and find the best move in this critical position: **Whenever the structure or material has changed, it is an important position and we need to make changes in our general plans.** 1.Our opponent's last move was reasonable and good. It puts some pressure against the black weaknesses. It is tactically safe, and makes no threats;We can move on to our own ideas. 2.We would like to attack against the white king, since we have open lines against it. We have massive center and bishop pair; Our king is quite safe in the center, and we need to open the position for our bishops. So we need to put our king behind the center pawns while keeping them fluid; so don't move the pawns until you are ready. 3.Candidate moves. 3a)The queen has an attack 13...Qa5, but 14.Nf3 e5 is considerable. So we only have one with the queen. 3b)13...Rg8, activates the rook, so it is candidate. 3c)13...Be5 is attacking, but it clearly is not too great after 14.Rad1. Still we should consider this the last of our candidate moves. 3d)13...e5 is not a useful move. It restricts the activity of our pieces and allows 14.e4 at least. It is not good. 3e)King moves? Ke7-We should consider this lastly.   4.Now we have found the candidates, 4 moves. We should go from the potentially strongest to the weakest, most forcing to non forcing. By the way, all of these moves are safe :) I have inadvertantly calculated basic safety in step 3. So let us calculate 13...Be5, 13...Rg8, 13...Qa5 13...Ke7. 13...Be5 14.Rad1(no other considerable moves really) and the position has no more forcing moves. Thus we should evaluate: black should still be more active, but with his 13th move he has not helped activity. White is close and has more pieces developed. Therefore, white has gained in acitivty and is about equal, or slightly worse. In material, it is equal. thus the position is about equal after 13...Be5. Many players will try to think about doubled pawns, the attack, the king in the middle...etc... It just confuses them and they can't make a final judgement anyways. The 2 factors of activity and material will be the evaluation, and it is extremely accurate in almost all the positions. Now we look at 13...Rg8. This is a very good looking move, but it does give white a pawn. Since black has activated his rook and is clearly ahead in the activity department, white MUST take the material. 14.Qxh6 Ke7 Now the position seems quiet, and we should make the evaluation. However, black does have a "threat". He threatens 15...B} Rg8 {(!)This is the strong pawn sacrifice. To be honest, I did not calculate much in these variations. I used the rule: If there is a sacrifice(reasonable: Maybe an unclear or dubious at best) for activity, play it on the board if it is safe. This is great against strong and weaker players alike. 1.It shows you are not afraid of them, and are playing for their throat 2.Weaker players are frightened by aggressive sacrifices It is reasonable, and gives quite a lot of activity.  *By the way, I am betting the computer does not like this move much! However, even it may like this move in maybe 3rd or 4th place, since it does have quite a lot of positional justification.} 14. Qxh6 Ke7 {Even though we planned this on the previous move, it is not necessarily the best. We should think in the "fresh" positions, since we have clearer visualization. However, I am pretty sure it is best.} 15. f4 Bd7 {Principle of attack; Black is threatening to win the queen. } 16. Qh4 e5 {Although 16...Rh8 was intended in my calculation(And it is quite good after 16...Rh8 17.Qf2 e5=.), 16...e5! is even stronger, threatening Rg4. You see that even though we may have plannedin our calculations, we should always start our thought process in a position where we need to calculate.} 17. fxe5 {This is another reason for the aggressive sacrifice: White makes a losing move just a few moves after the sacrifice! 17.e4! accepting a disadvantage, was best, by the way. You can work out the variations. } Bxe5 18. g3 {This is the move that seals the loss for white. Let us use our thought process for white to find the best defense. Since black has just attacked our rook and is threatening material, we MUST save the material, because if we are down material AND our opponent has better activity, we are fightin a losin battle. Thus, we MUST save the rook unless it is tactically losing. 18.Rae1/d1 are the candidates;Other lose quickly, like g3. I don't think there is huge difference between the 2, but after 18...Rh8 19.Bh7(A must for the same reason), 19...Rbg8, white is losing. However, he needed to psychologically be brave and play this likely losing line. In fact, if 18.Rae1, then 20.e4! is a strong counterattack. Thus, white needed to play this line, even though it is clear advantage to black. Now, even if black just takes the rook, he is winning.} Rgh8 {Now a simple tactic wins the game. Very simple; Black has supreme activity over the kingside; A combination was inevitable.} 19. Qa4 Bxg3 20. Rf3 Rxh2 {(!)It is a strong move. } 21. Nf1 {The best move, seeing that white was already lost; this helps white create counterplay and complicate one last time if black does not end the game. Now we need to use our calculation process again, since it is critical. 1.Our opponent attacked us 2.We need to find a combination or retreat. That is it! The generalities don't count much in the tactical position! 3.Queen has nothing. Rook can give 2 checks, but they obviously both don't work ...Rh4 is a candidate. 3....Bf2+ is a move that is it. We needed to find a good move that helps us in the position; Only 2 moves can do the trick. ...Bf2+ is more forcing. 21...Bf2+ 22.Rxf2 Rg8+ and mate follows. So it is the best move, since it forceds mate.} Rg8 {And the game is over. I hope you learned about the thinking process in this annotation.}
