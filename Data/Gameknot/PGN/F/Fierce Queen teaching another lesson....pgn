1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Giuoco Piano it will be: one of my favourites with White...} 4. O-O Nf6 5. c3 {no fear for Nxe4: after Re1, White will set things straight...} O-O 6. d4 exd4 7. cxd4 Be7 {White has already castled, so Bb4 is of no use anymore...} 8. d5 {White is already ahead in tempo...} Nb8 9. Nc3 d6 10. h3 {taking away Bg4...} h6 11. Bf4 a6 12. e5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 Bd6 14. Bh2 Nbd7 15. f4 {White is conquering the center...} Nc5 16. b4 Nce4 17. Nxe4 Nxe4 18. Qd3 Nf6 19. g4 {keeping up the pressure...} Bxb4 20. a3 Bc5+ 21. Kg2 {Black is not getting any grip, on the White position...} Nh7 22. Qb3 {setting up a change of scenery...} Bd6 23. Rad1 b5 24. Bd3 Bb7 25. Bxh7+ Kxh7 26. Qd3+ {mission accomplished...} Kg8 27. Bg3 Bxe5 {Black needs to release some tensions...} 28. fxe5 Re8 29. Qf5 {although it might be too late for Black...} Qc8 {chess blindness, no doubt: Black should have tried Bxd5+; but the pin over Qd8 might prove lethal...} 30. Qxf7+ {and Black resigned: probably fed up, with his own play..}
