1. e4 {we play 3 minutes for a whole game, and earn 10 seconds for each move we play; not for the faint hearted...} c5 2. Bc4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {too sharp here, and nowadays I know better: after Nc3 you should always consider d6, or at least a6...} 4. f4 {to be honest, I might have played this myself against this Hungarian variation of the Sicilian; followed by Nf3 and castle... to really test this setup however, strongest is Qf3, e6 (the obligatory move), Nb5! (threatening Nd6+, and ruining the setup), d6 (forced), Qd3!, forcing Ke7... after this, there is no Ne7 to complete Blacks' planned setup...} a6 {hence this very important move: the Najdorf move...} 5. a4 {obviously avoiding b5; but that was never the issue... better here is d3, to neutralize the center...} e6 6. Nf3 {also here, d3 was more sound...} Ne7 7. O-O {e5, was a better option here; follows d5 and exchange of the center...} O-O {I always handle the same rule: castle before d5; not really necessary in the absence of Bb5+: conclusion is loss of tempo... note to self...} 8. d3 {a bit late for d3; e5 was to be preferred; after d5, exd6, Nf5, Ne4, Nxd6, Nxd6, Qxd6, Black has a tiny edge...} d5 9. Ba2 {avoiding the exchange, which is a smart thing to do; exd5, exd5, would release Bc8, which is usually bad news for White in this variation...} d4 {after the designated Nbc6, Qe2, b6, Qf2!, White in fact has solved all problems; so I started to look for other complications... after the forced Ne2, Nbc6, I would make up my mind again...} 10. Qe1 {this move took me by surprise: had I overlooked something? was I in danger, after just dxc3? or was he just preventing the pin over Nf3, after Bg4?} h6 {I was expecting Whites' next move - f5, opening a diagonal for Bc1 - but was not sure what to do about it; I was doing OK in time, with still 3 minutes on the clock, and my opponent was suffering loss of time; this would at least prevent Ng5... also Bd7 is OK: Ne2 is still forced...} 11. f5 {by now, I was getting really curious: of course, dxc3 ends all; so I just went on developing...} Nbc6 12. Qh4 {I was expecting f6, Bxf6, Ne2, with the smallest edge for Black; it is still over after dxc3, so I decided to take the plunge...} dxc3 13. Bxh6 {no way back...} exf5 {a shame: best is Nxf5, Qxd8 (forced, since Bh6 is under attack also), Rxd8, Bxg7, Nxg7!; also gxf5, Bxg7, Kxg7, or Bd4+, Kh1, cxb2, were much more promising...} 14. Ng5 {after bxc3, Qa5, Bg5, Black has a very uneasy advantage to defend; but White is getting too eager...} Ne5 {too tied up, with my own ghosts, and completely forgetting the fact that I was a piece ahead already; simply Qd4+, Rf2, or Bxh6, Qxh6, Qd4+, Rf2 solves all problems...} 15. Bxg7 {by now, White is getting frustrated: after bxc3, N7c6, exf5, Bxf5, g4!, Black still has a lot to be desired... the game is dead equal...} Kxg7 16. exf5 {betting on the wrong Knight: after Qh7+, Kf6, Qh6, Rh8, Nh7+!, Rxh7, Qxh7, cxb2, Rae1, White still had enough opportunities to fight on...} Nxf5 17. Qh7+ Kf6 18. Ne4+ {maybe a better try was Qh4, Rh8, Ne4+, Kg7, Qxd8, Rxd8, bxc3...} Ke7 {the clocks were at 1:48 for White, against 3:40 for Black, while having reached nothing and lost a piece... apart from Rxh5 (to allow Qh4+), Bxf5, Qh4+, Kd7, Nxc5+, Kc6, Qb4 (hold c3), Qd6, d4, b6!, there is no play left, and the Queen is probably lost after Rh8; so White resigned...}
