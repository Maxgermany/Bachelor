1. g3 {Thus begins the return match to the game I have just annotated, with an opening I have never seen before. The principal idea is clearly to fianchetto White's light-squared bishop, but this is not a common opening.} d5 2. Bg2 e5 {There is nothing stopping me from putting two pawns in the centre, so why shouldn't I? Such an opportunity is extremely rare for Black.} 3. d3 Nf6 4. Nf3 Nc6 {White has formed a Barcza formation on the kingside; Black has a classic centre-based position, with his pawns and knights controlling the centre.} 5. O-O Be7 6. e4 {Now, finally, White opens out and takes on a more dynamic position with a strike at the centre.} O-O {Left to myself I would have played 6...d4, but GameKnot's DB showed that this pawn advance is premature and collapses after 7.c3, so I went for what the database showed was a more popular option, i.e. to castle kingside.} 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. c4 Ndb4 9. Ne1 {I can't see why he did this move: it is counter-developing and very passive. Na3 would fulfil the same purpose.} Nd4 10. a3 Nbc6 11. Bxc6 Nxc6 12. Nf3 {And back again.} Bg4 {Suddenly a new idea forms. Why don't I build up pressure on White's pinned knight, piling more pieces on until the attackters outnumber the defenders and I win the pinned piece!} 13. Kg2 Nd4 {The beauty of this is that, while the knight is pinned to the queen, the queen is tied to the knight's defence, so it cannot move to liberate the knight! A vicious circle, culminating in the fact that none of the two pieces can move. A worthy prize in itself, but I was after more...I wanted to WIN the knight.} 14. Nbd2 Bg5 15. h3 {Only one problem obstructs my cunning plan. The attackers, unfortunately, do not outnumber the defenders.} Bxd2 16. hxg4 Bxc1 17. Rxc1 Nxf3 18. Qxf3 {Fine then. Mass exchanges, and the material count is still equal.} c6 19. b4 Qf6 20. Qxf6 gxf6 {Excellent! A rooks-and-pawns endgame. I love the endless complexity in their apparent simplicity, and the immense capacity for any side to make a tiny positional slip which costs the game.} 21. Rfe1 Rad8 {Both rooks to the semi-open central files, but I think the d-file offers greater opportunities for Black than the e-file does for White.} 22. Rc3 b6 23. f4 Rfe8 24. f5 Kg7 25. a4 a6 {The queenside pawn formation looks suspiciously like a very well-known endgame pawn promotion puzzle. But, since the rooks are on the board, the best that I can expect of these pawns is to be exchanged off.} 26. Kh3 Kh6 27. Kh4 Rd4 28. Re4 Rxe4 29. dxe4 Rd8 {Off goes one pair of rooks.} 30. b5 {Initiating the pawn exchanges.} axb5 31. cxb5 c5 32. a5 bxa5 33. Rxc5 Rb8 34. b6 Rxb6 35. Rxa5 {BAM! BAM! BAM! and all the queenside pawns have disappeared. Now the battle focuses on the kingside...where the position looks drawn.} Rb8 36. Ra4 Rb1 {Aha! I saw the light! I could threaten checkmate after 37...Rh7  ! Maybe my opponent hasn't noticed! In any case, there was only one feasible move that he could defend with...} 37. g5+ {...and, unfortunately, he found it.} fxg5+ 38. Kg4 Rb6 39. Ra7 f6 {Closing the kingside pawn formation again. I have gained a slim advantage, in the form of a pawn, but I very much doubt that I was able to convert it into a win.} 40. Ra2 Rb1 41. Rh2+ Kg7 42. Re2 Rb4 43. Re1 Kh6 44. Re2 {A draw was agreed. Should it have been a draw? What do you think? Are there any wins in sight? I very much doubt it :-).}
