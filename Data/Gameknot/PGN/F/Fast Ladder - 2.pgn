1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nd4 {Bird's Defense. creative, but not strong but not bad. an interesting surprise weapon for weekend tourneys or speed chess, but in the online venue (with 3 day time control?) a very interesting choice. } 4. Nxd4 exd4 5. O-O c6 6. Bc4 d6 7. d3 Nf6 {black assumes a standard formation. White has more space. the B on c4 can retreat to b3 and following a3/c3 further retreat but still maintain an aggressive stance towards the center. Since Black has a defensive formation I would give White an edge, IMHO: Black should consider ...Be6 with the idea of ...O-O or heading his king to ...O-O-O. both slow. } 8. Nd2 {This Knight heads to K-side. white can afford to invest time as Black's bishops have limited scope... } Be7 9. Nf3 h6 {...h6? drops an important clogging center pawn. ...Qb6 was called for here. which would also serve two purposes: 1) help get king towards ...O-O-O; 2) make White think twice about moving the dark squared Bishop... development is more important. ...h6? does not help make the king more secure AND does not support the center. } 10. Nxd4 {The Pawnraider still raids pawns. This pawn grab is all plus for White. the center becomes imposing rather than simply strong. the N can threaten to go to f5 or b5 following ...c5. the N is much more influential in the game. } O-O {I would still consider ...Bd7, ...Qc7/Qb6, and ...O-O-O.} 11. Be3 {hoping for Qd2, f4, f5, Rf3, & Bxh6.   I am not afraid of ...Ng4 as Qe2, ...Nxe3, Qxe3 leaves White developed for a K-side attack and all pieces can get there quickly. Black will not be able to defend easily... } c5 12. Ne2 {The N is eyeing the d5 square. } Bg4 13. f3 Be6 14. Nf4 Bxc4 15. dxc4 Qc7 16. Qe2 b6 17. Bd2 {relocates to better diagonal. Black cannot get the B to f6 without permitting White's N to stay on d5.} Rfe8 18. Bc3 Nd7 {...Bf8 permits Bxf6 gxf6, destroying the King's safety. } 19. Nd5 Qd8 20. Rad1 Rc8 21. f4 Bf8 {...Nf6 is called for... in which case, 18....Qd8 was much better than ...Nd7.} 22. Rd3 Nf6 {OOPS in a difficult position. } 23. Nxf6+ gxf6 24. Rg3+ Bg7 25. Qg4 {...Kf8, 26.Qxg7+ Ke7, 29.Bxf6+ and Black's queen drops. black resigns. }
