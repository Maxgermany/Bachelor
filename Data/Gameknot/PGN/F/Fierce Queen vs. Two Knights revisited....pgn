1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 {Two Knights' defense by the book so far... I mostly play Nxf7, Kxf7, Qf3+, and see where this will lead me; best now is probably Ke6!?, Nc3; however, Nce7 is much safer... recommended here is the Fischer line d4!, Be7, Nxf7, Kxf7, Qf3+, with roughly the same results; I should try that one time... this time however, I tried something else; soon to my regret...} 6. Qh5 {based on a simple threat; Qxf7 mate, g6 is obligatory...} g6 7. Qf3 Qxg5 8. Bxd5 {so far so good... blacks' next move I had predicted, but I had overlooked it's gravity...} Nd4 9. Qxf7+ Kd8 10. Kd1 {after Bb3, Qxg2, so there is not much choice... Bg4+ is a serious threat, after f3, Bf5...} Bf5 11. d3 {a very useful tempo, which might lead to swapping Queens...} Qg4+ 12. Bf3 Nxf3 13. Qd5+ Kc8 14. Qxf3 {so far so good, white has a pawn and the balance is somewhat restored... Qb4, a3, Qd4 is probably best for black, or straightaway Qd4...} Qa4 15. Nc3 Qd7 16. h3 h5 {Bb4 was best here...} 17. Be3 Bg7 18. Kc1 Rf8 19. Qg3 a5 {in my opinion Qc6 is best here...} 20. Re1 Re8 21. Bg5 Ra6 22. Ne4 {by now, white has the better of the play... but making progress is not easy...} Rc6 23. Kb1 Qd4 {better Qd5...} 24. Be3 Qa4 25. b3 Qb4 26. Bd2 Qd4 27. a3 Bxe4 {too impatient; better Rf8 first...} 28. Rxe4 Qc5 29. Ra2 Rf8 30. Be3 Qb5 31. f3 Qd5 32. Qe1 Rh8 33. Rc4 b6 34. Re4 Re6 {it is hard for black to keep finding the right moves; this is not helping either...} 35. Qe2 Qd8 {black retreats; tougher was Bf6, Ra1, h4, Ka2, Qc6...} 36. Bc1 {mainly preparing b4, with possibilities to break up the a-file freeing Ra2... or d4/f4 in some cases...} Kb7 37. f4 {now or never...} Qd5 38. d4 Rhe8 39. fxe5 c5 40. Qd3 {too early for c4...} Bf8 {considering whites' next move, R6e7 would have been much safer...} 41. c4 {finally releasing Ra2...} Qc6 {blacks' position was already deteriorating; Qd7, was best here to take the edge of an upcoming d5... after Rf2, cxd4, Rxd4, Qc6, black can hold out longer... black resigned; after d5, Qd7, Qf3!, R6e7, e6! all is over...}
