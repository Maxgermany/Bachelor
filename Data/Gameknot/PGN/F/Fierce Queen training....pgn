1. e4 c5 2. f4 Nc6 3. Nf3 d6 4. Be2 {a novelty on my behalf, in this Morra gambit: I usually play c3...} Nf6 5. d3 e5 {better something like g6, 0-0, Bg7...} 6. O-O Be7 7. c3 O-O 8. Na3 {on route to square c4 and relocate the Queens' Knight; of course, b5 is no option anymore...} Be6 {not the way to handle this: better exf4, Bxf4, d5...} 9. f5 Bd7 10. Nc4 {now heading for square e3, and prevent d5 (after d5, Nxe5); amongst other perks...} Qc7 {'completing development': but not very useful, considering Whites' plans...} 11. Ne3 Rad8 {way too passive: Black needs to create counterplay, or White will march right over him; b5 would have been a better option...} 12. g4 {here comes trouble, supported by Ne3...} h6 {futile and losing: better Rb8/Rc8, g5, Ne8; this wil also open up the h-file...} 13. h4 Bc8 {trying to prepare d5: although it was already hard for Black, to find sustaining play, this makes it worse; better straightaway d5 (White is threatening Nd5), g5, and try Nh5...} 14. g5 hxg5 15. hxg5 Ne8 {it is not easy, to find better play: Black is already being totally crushed...} 16. Nd5 {attacking the moot Qc7: now, also f5-f6 becomes a big problem...} Qd7 {or maybe Qa5...} 17. Rf2 {to me, stronger than Nh2, Nc7, f6...} g6 {Nc7, Rh2, Nxd5, Qe1!, will not help anymore: White is threatening mate; best here is Qxf5, exf5, Bxf5, Qh4, f6...} 18. f6 {ending all illusions for Black: he will lose a lot of material; maybe best is Qg4+, Rg2, Qe6, Nh2, Bxf6... Black however resigned...}
