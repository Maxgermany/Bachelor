1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {Threatens the pawn with the knight.} Nc6 3. Bc4 {This is a very attacking move.} Nf6 {Not a very good move, leads to the Fried Liver Gambit.} 4. Ng5 {Threatens Nxf7.} d5 {The only way to block the threat.} 5. exd5 Nxd5 {Some people think the exchange can be dangerous.} 6. Nxf7 {The gambit.} Kxf7 7. Qf3+ {Checking the king and threatening the knight on d5.} Ke6 {The only way to protect the knight.} 8. Nc3 {The pinned knight is troubled.} Nce7 9. d4 {If the pawn is taken, white wins the knight after: exd4 10. Qe4. The king moves out of check and white takes the knight with the knight or the bishop.} c6 {Extra protection.} 10. dxe5 g6 11. Bg5 {Threatening to eliminate one of the knights protecters.} h6 {A weak attempt to stop the bishop on g5.} 12. Bxe7 {Takes the knight, and black's knight is now slightly more unprotected.} Bxe7 13.

Qxg6 dxc4 {The bishop does not matter in this position, as white is on the offense.} 22. Rxd8 {Captures the rook.} Kxd8 23. Qxf6+ {The game is equal and black is in trouble.} Kc7 24. Qf7+ Kb6 {Retreating to the other side of the board.} 25. e7 {Threatening two queens.} cxb3 {Threatens mate in two, but black misses Qb3, checking the king and giving white another move, which he will use to get two queens.} 26. Qxb3+ Kc7 27. e8=Q {The swap is offered. If black do not accept, they are stuffed within a few moves.} Qxe8 28. Rxe8 Kd6 {Trying to get to the centre of the board, where it is harder to checkmate.} 29. Qd3+ Kc7 30. Rd8 b5 {Now the king is safe from side-attacks at a5.} 31. Qd6+ Kb7 {This is almost the position of one of my puzzles.} 32. Qe7+ Ka6 {Should've played Kb6.} 33. Rd6+ {The king is forced to play a5.} Ka5 34. Rxh6 {Threatening unstoppable mate in two.} Ka4 35. a3 {The pawn moves up, and now the king is in checkmate in one move no matter what.} Ka5 36. Qb4# {Checkmate!!!}
