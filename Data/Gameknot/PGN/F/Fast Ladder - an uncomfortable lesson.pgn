1. c4 {I don't usually annotate my losses publicly but I feel I need to publish this one in order to sublimate the experience!  My opponent reduced me to paralysis and then converted his positional advantage into material superiority with inevitable mate to follow.  He kicked off with the English Opening.} Nf6 {I responded with this flexible reply, intending a King's Indian formation.} 2. Nc3 g6 3. d4 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 {The Saemisch Variation of the KID.} O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 {This seems a sensible developing move, given that the QB has nowhere useful to go at present.} 7. Bd3 {White develops his minor pieces behind his wall of pawns: a very flexible formation, slightly more aggressively placed than Black's.  This bishop development might have been less attractive had Black played 6...Nc6 because Black could then have harassed the B with ...Nb4.} e5 {Black attacks White's centre: a typical KID move.} 8. Nge2 a6 {Discourages White from playing Nb5 but weakens b6.} 9. O-O c5 {The reason why Black played 8... a6, since this move weakens d6.  Black wanted to cement the centre and then attack it from the flanks.  } 10. d5 {This pawn proves to be a real thorn in Black's centre.  This is a common pawn formation in the KID, so I doubt that Black has made his decisive error yet but his position deteriorates fast now, so look out for errors over the next few moves.  White applies a vice to the position.} Ne8 {Black plans to assault the centre with ...f5.  The alternative way of achieving this was 10...Nh5, which puts a dim knight on the rim but at least does not cramp Black's position.} 11. Ng3 {White's natural response, already planned for when he played 8.Nge2.  White might not have wanted to play this after 10... Nh5} Nb6 {Played to provide further support for ...f5 from the QB} 12. a4 {White threatens to push the N back again} Rb8 {Black finds a somewhat passive response, planning to retreat the attacked N to a8.  Perhaps 12....Bd7 followed by ...Nc8 might have been better?  However, I generally find that ...Bd7 is a mistake whenever I play it in the KID.  Therefore I think 12....a5 would have been better.} 13. a5 Na8 {Only one of Black's pieces is off the back rank.  This cannot be good at this stage of the game.} 14. Qa4 {Nothing seems to be threatened by this move but it helps to cramp Black.} Nac7 {a8 was such an awful square for the N, I felt it more important to redevelop it than to play the planned ...f5} 15. b4 {This accentuates the weaknesses in Black's position.  If Black allows White to exchange pawns on c5, White simply wins the pawn and then the exchange as the Rf8 cannot move.  If Black exchanges on b4, White can play Bb6, pinning the Nc7 against Black's Q} f5 {Belatedly, Black tries something aggressive.} 16. exf5 gxf5 {Black threatens a fork on f4} 17. Nge2 {White preempts that threat.} Bd7 {Now surely this move is OK?  It tries to push White's Q away after all ...} 18. Qa3 {White reinforces pressure on c5} Nf6 {The only way for Black to reinforce c5 was with 18...Qe7, so could this have been preferable? No: after 18...Qe7 19 bxc5 dxc5 20 Bxc5 the Q and R are skewered.  After 18...Nf6, superficially Black's position doesn't look too bad but it is about to get worse.} 19. bxc5 dxc5 20. Bxc5 Rf7 21. Ng3 {Now the pawn on f5 is under double attack.  Black defends by "developing" his Q to c8.  Alternatives were 21...Nfe8, 21...f4 or 21...e4.  Each had their disadvantages: 21....Nfe8 would have been just another meek retreat and would have deprive the other N and the Bd7 and Q of a potential square; 21...f4 would have ceded control of e4, allowing White's minor pieces to swarm into Black's position via that square; 21...e4 would simply have lost a pawn and also lost control of e4.} Qc8 22. Rfe1 {Now e5 comes under attack and the same considerations apply once more!} Nfe8 {The N retreat reveals the Bg7's defence of e5.  Black seems to be holding... just.} 23. Rab1 {Now what's this?  White doesn't appear to be threatening anything but just examine Black's options.  They all seemed to lead to loss of material until I found the move played.} Kh8 24. Nh5 {Now White threatens to swap N for the key piece Bg7, defender of e5.} e4 {So Black decides to advance the pawn, with the thought of possibly swapping on c3 but I don't think anything worked here.} 25. fxe4 fxe4 26. Nxe4 Bg4 {Again an aggressive gesture but ineffective.} 27. Nxg7 Nxg7 {Too late, I realised that 27...Rxg7 was no good because of the riposte 28. Bd4.  Black is still only two pawns down but getting worse fast now as I hadn't seen the corollary of this move.  Would 27...Kxg7 have been any better?} 28. Nd6 {!  White forks the Rf7 and Qc8.  } Qd7 29. Nxf7+ Qxf7 30. Re7 Qf4 {The only way to evade attack with the Q and still defend the Nc7} 31. Rf1 {Now the Q cannot continue to defend c7 and has nothing else constructive to do.  I gave up the ghost at this point.}
