1. b4 e5 2. Ba3 d5 {"Jesse" may be half-drunk, but I'm not. I take advantage of his odd opening to form an ideal center.} 3. c3 Nf6 4. e3 Bg4 5. Be2 {I really didn't expect him to overlook the threat to the Q, but let's just say I thought it was worth trying. Besides, it's not like 4... B-N5 weakened my position.} h5 6. d4 Nbd7 {I considered 6... P-K5, but decided it would leave me more options if I kept the center flexible.} 7. Nd2 c6 8. Qc2 Qc7 {Both of us are ready to castle now, although I'm still considering castling K-side.} 9. O-O-O Be7 10. Kb1 O-O {With the Kings on opposite sides, I can attack "Jesse"'s King without exposing my own too much. } 11. Rc1 a5 {Trying to open some Q-side lines.} 12. Bd1 axb4 13. Bxb4 {Forced [13 PxNP loses the QB.]} Qb6 {With the threat of 14... BxB 15 PxB QxP ch.} 14. a3 {Trying to defend the threat by adding a guard to the B. But...} Rxa3 {...I simply remove the guard. BxR is impossible becuase of the pin.} 15. h3 {Probably a frustration move.} Bxb4 16. cxb4 Qxb4+ {I follow up with my plan.} 17. Nb3 {Twice guarded, the Knight looks safe. But...} Bxd1 {Removing a guard. Whether the recapture is with the Rook or the Queen, either way the Knight on N3 falls.} 18. Rxd1 {I choose to capture with the Q, forcing the exchange of Queens and a won ending.} Qxb3+ 19. Qxb3 Rxb3+ {"Jesse" could have resigned here, but he let me have the honor of checkmating. I don't know whether he actually didn't see it, being half-drunk, or whether he chose to let me win a won game with a mate.} 20. Ka1 Ra8# {After this, we tossed around a football and a Frisbee with the kids, in spite of inclement weather. Thankfully, the backyard of "Jesse"'s house is covered... it's part of a housing complex, and they have a covered play area for rainy days.}
