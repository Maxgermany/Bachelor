[Opening "Scotch (C45), Ghulam Kassim variation"]

1. e4 {White starts things off with the most popular opening, the King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {Black responds with the King's Pawn Game.} 2. Nf3 {White continues with the King's knight opening, which I expected, for I use it all the time.} Nc6 {I continue the King's Pawn Game.} 3. d4 {White brings out the Scotch Opening.} exd4 {I respond with the Scotch Relfsson Gambit, which I usually play in the Scotch.} 4. Nxd4 {As expected, white responds with the Scotch game.} Nxd4 {Black goes ahead with the Scotch Ghulam Kassim variation.} 5. Qxd4 {As I expected, the Scotch continues.} d6 {Black continues the Scotch. } 6. Nc3 {The Scotch ends. So with the traditional game openings over with, anything can happen at this point.} c5 {White attacks the queen.} 7. Qa4+ {Not what I totally expected, but this can easily be countered.} Bd7 8. Qb3 f6 {Based on computer analysis: Mistake. Best: Bc6. I can see why. The b7 the pawn was completely unprotected, so white could gain a slight advantage here both in points and in position.} 9. Bb5 {Fortunately for black, white instead responds with Bb5. The computer analysis sees this as a mistake of course.} Bxb5 {I decide to except a swap, although this will put me in check again.} 10. Qxb5+ {I still wish to castle...} Qd7 {...so I use my queen to protect me. This will keep me from castling though if white accepts a fair trade.} 11. Qd3 {Fortunately for black, white wants to keep his queen. } O-O-O {With black's queen out of the way, black decides to castle queen-side.} 12. Be3 {A bit surprised white didn't castle king-side here. He did now have the option to castle queen-side himself though. } g5 13. O-O-O {White does castle queen-side.} Kb8 {The computer analysis views this move as a mistake, but I see nothing wrong with this move, although it is right that instead I should of played Ne7 or Nh6 instead of moving my king, for it was in no immediate danger.} 14. Bxc5 {Good move by white. If I played xc5, then 15. Qxd7; Rxd7 16. Rxd7 would of occured, leaving white with a major disadvantage (-5). } Be7 {I saw this though, and accepted losing the pawn.} 15. g3 b6 {Now to make white's bishop fall back.} 16. Bxb6 {??? Why did white make this move? There was no need for this, for it takes away a somewhat strong piece from white, and only a measly pawn for black. The computer analysis, of course, views this as a mistake. Along with that, the computer analysis said that black had a advantage, until now of course.} axb6 {I take as expected.} 17. Qa6 {Not the best move, but not the worse either. Computer analysis sees this as an inaccuracy. If white's plan was to somehow enforce checkmate now, or try to take the b6 pawn, it wouldn't work.} Qb7 {I offer a fair trade again with the queens. } 18. Qd3 {White moves his queen back to d3, where he started.} Nh6 {No way white would attack d6, so black brings his other knight out.} 19. f3 {White knows that by playing this move that my knight could not move to g4, which I was originally planning.} Nf7 {I decide f7 instead, hoping to provoke the queen by playing my knight on e5 next move.} 20. f4 {Again white doesn't accept it, but I'm willing to trade pawns.} gxf4 21. Qd5 {? Not gxf4? Not what I expected. On top of that, now white wants to trade queens it seems like. The computer analysis views this as a mistake, and of course, that gxf4 would of been better. } Nh6 {I saw my queen in danger, but my knight as well. I decided to let white decide the fate of our queens. I was gonna go for Ng4. The computer analysis views this as an inaccuracy, and that Qxd5 would of been better.} 22. gxf4 {Now white plays gxf4.} f5 {Not sure what I was thinking here. If white plays exf5, I can't play Nxf5 next because then White would play Qxf5, leaving me with a disadvantage, but for some reason, I didn't see that in the actual game.} 23. Rd4 {Guess white did not either. Computer analysis sees this as a mistake and that Qe6 would of been better, which is true. } fxe4 {I decide to go ahead with taking the e4 pawn. Computer analysis views this as a mistake, saying Bf6 was better. Definitely true.} 24. Nxe4 {I expected that to happen. Computer analysis again views this as a mistake, again saying Qe6 was better.} Nf7 {Why did I do that????? I moved that knight earlier to protect it from the queen. I moved it right back in harms way here. This was a bad move by white. In computer analysis, to me, inaccuracy is minor mistake, mistake is mild mistake, and blunder is big mistake. Of course this is a blunder! } 25. Qxf7 {And this time, white saw the opportunity, to black's dismay.} Rdf8 {I attempt to drive back the queen and take the f4 pawn. } 26. Qc4 Rxf4 {The plan goes perfectly.} 27. Rhd1 {Rooks lined up like that are never good for the opponent.} Rd8 {I give the d6 pawn extra protection.} 28. Nxd6 {White enforces his plan, which puts both my queen and f4 rook in danger, yet computer analysis views this as a blunder, saying Qe2 was better. I don't think this move was a blunder, but it wasn't the best move for sure.} Rxd4 {I decide for complex fair trade. Surprisingly no complaints from the computer analysis. } 29. Rxd4 {Again white is unwilling to do trade with the queens. Computer analysis says this was a mistake and that Qxd4 was better than Rxd4. } Bxd6 {I take the knight, giving me back a slight advantage, which was actually bigger than it looks. Computer analysis views this as a mistake and that Bg5+ was a better move. If the computer only knew...} 30. Qd3 {Computer analysis views this move as a big blunder for white. White does have a disadvantage.} Qc7 {Blunder by black. The computer views that Qh1+ was better. Checkmate still wasn't immediately imminent, even with that move. } 31. Ra4 {Again, another view by the computer analysis that is a big blunder. This move indicates that white might be trying to attack my king from the A section. Computer analysis views h4 as a better move. } Bxh2 {I take the h2 pawn. The computer sees this as a blunder, and says Bf4+ was the best move, and for good reason. If I played that, white's queen was gone. 31. Bf4+, and then either 32. Rxf4 Rxd3, or 32. Kb1 Rxd3. Either way, white's queen would of been lost and checkmate would of been right around the corner. I missed an opportunity, but the next one was right around the corner.} 32. Qa6 {White protects his queen and prepares for checkmate, but unfortunately for white, his fate was sealed. There's a good reason why the computer analysis says Blunder Mate(3). I can always see oppurtunity for checkmate, and I certainly saw it now.} Bf4+ {With the d8 rook positioned where it is, white's fate was sealed. Checkmate was unavoidable in three moves. White's options were 1: 33. Rxf4 Qxf4+ 34. Kb1 Rd1#. White could also play 33. Kb1 Rd1#, causing checkmate in two moves instead. Either way, black won this game, and white knew it. wrytry resigns and this wonderful game was over. I hoped you enjoyed this annotation and feel free to rate and comment about it.}
