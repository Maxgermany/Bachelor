1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Nf3 {thus, we reach some breed of the Nimzovich defense; Queens' Fianchetto, if played correctly...} Qd7 5. c3 f6 {or e6, c3, Qd7: but not this; e6 was asked for...} 6. Be3 fxe5 {better e6, Nbd2, Nge7...} 7. Bb5 e4 {asking for trouble: better, exd4, Ne5, Qd6, cxd4...} 8. Ne5 Qd6 9. f3 {White is already a pawn behind, and this next inspired gambit is the beginning, of a long range of forced moves, for Black; after just exf3, Qxf3, the contours of Blacks' upcoming problems become suddenly very clear: mainly at square f7...} Nf6 10. fxe4 dxe4 {Bxe4, 0-0, is leading to roughly the same...} 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Nd2 g6 {already, Black has to make a lot of judgement calls: Whites' game however, is unfolding rapidly...} 13. Qb3 {stronger, than a direct Ndc4: White is making work of the weakened b-file; and the by now gaping gap on f7, supporting the deadly threat Nf7: e6 will not help anymore, after the already planned Qb7...} Nd5 {a hard call, probably aiming for Nb6, after e6: a better chance might have been Qd5, c4, Qd6, Qb7, Rd8, c5, Qd5...} 14. Qb7 Rd8 15. Ndc4 Qf6 {after Qe6, Nxc6, Rc8, Nxa7, Rd8, Nc6, Rc8, 0-0, Black would not be enjoying a picnic; this, however is worse: this will be a very hard to stomach meal...} 16. O-O {pinning Bf5, will prove deadly...} h5 {obviously avoiding a direct g4 or even Ng4, followed by Nce5: it is not easy, to find other options, but this is certainly not helping; I would try Bg7, Nxc6, Nxe3, Nxe3, Rd6, d5, 0-0...} 17. Nxc6 Nxe3 {here, it was a toss up between Rc8 or giving it up on d8, with e6; again, this is not helping...} 18. Nxe3 {again, exposing the weakness of Bf5...} Rd6 {at this point, Blacks' position was screaming for e6, to at least support Bf5; but Black decides to hang on to the Rook...} 19. Nxf5 {with also Rd6 attacked, this is even stronger than Qa8+ (Qc8+ might not work now), Kf7, Ne5+, Kg8, Nxg6!, and the position is rather discouraging for Black, to say the least: but it gets better...} gxf5 {forced, no doubt: Blacks' position is about to fall apart......} 20. Qc8+ {this opens up new devastating possibilities on f5...} Kf7 {of course, there is no point anymore in Rd8, Qxd8+...} 21. Rxf5 {and again, my opponent is about to lose his Queen...} Rxc6 {not much point in Qxf5, Qxf5+, and also Nc6 would be saved...} 22. Rxf6+ {gotcha...} Rxf6 23. Qxc7 Bh6 {the only one: e4 is in dire need of support on e3...} 24. Re1 {and here is the reason: after e3, of course Qxa7; and White has a Queen and three pawns - not even to mention a staggering four connected free pawns - for a Rook and a Bishop; so roughly a full Rook ahead: if one of the e-pawns falls, all will be over...} e3 25. Qxa7 Rf8 {somewhat 'connecting the Rooks', but the King has to stay on guard for e7: I expected more something like Rg8, to be followed by Rf2, and contest g2; only way to defend is Qb7, so Black would win back the Queen and a pawn against two Rooks... would that be enough, with a Bishop left? probably not, but at least Black should have tried that...} 26. a4 {whatever happens: here comes trouble; that is for sure: after Rf2, b4, Rg8, Qb7, or just Rf2, Rf1...} Kg6 {doubling the Rooks, to not very much avail: this rules out an attack on g2, for now and probably forever; apart from Rf2, Bg5 was another to try and find a safer spot for the King and provide some cover for e7; this is losing rapidly...} 27. Qxe7 {this is bringing the Queen closer to the action: further diminishing Blacks' options, also bringing about nasty checks on the exposed Black King; Black however had enough, and he resigned... again: a tad early, for my taste; although it might be true, that Whites' Queen side pawns will decide this: in a fierce way...}
