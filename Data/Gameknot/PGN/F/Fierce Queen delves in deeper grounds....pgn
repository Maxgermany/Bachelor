1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Bd7 5. g3 Nc6 6. Bg2 Nf6 7. Nc3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. Nf5 Bxf5 10. exf5 Qd7 11. g4 h6 {some breed of the Philidor defense: all this was played in a matter of less than a minute; Black has reached a fully developed position, while White controls a big portion of the board at the cost of some development to be desired; my first hunch was to repair that, but Blacks' last - in fact weakening - move needed closer inspection...} 12. Bf4 {had I looked a bit closer, I might have found the stronger f4! (threatens g5), Nh7, Nd5!, controling f6, and winning the opening...} Kh7 13. Bg3 {lingering on two thoughts, and preparing f4; already better was h4, with a much better result...} Rfe8 14. h3 {covering for g4, to be able to play the Queen; still stronger would have been f4, practically forcing g5...} Ng8 15. f4 {by now, f4 has lost its momentum...} Bf6 {a very sound reply; Whites' advantage has vanished... frustrated, I tried to break iron with my bare hands...} 16. h4 {a terrible move; needed was Qd2, Bxc3, Qxc3, Nf6, and regroup...} Bxc3 17. bxc3 Re3 {in a matter of moves, things got totally out of hand: Bg3 and c3 are under attack, Rf3 is met with Rae1, and the cavalry comes rolling in... so I decided to take drastic measures...} 18. Qe1 {do not ever try this at home...} Rxe1 19. Rfxe1 Re8 20. Rab1 b6 21. Rxe8 Qxe8 22. Re1 Qd7 23. Be4 Kh8 24. g5 h5 25. g6 f6 26. Bd5 {a mistake: after Qxf5, I planned Bxg8, Kxg8, Re8 mate; but that will not work after Qxf5, Bxg8, Qxg6!, and two attacked Bishops... after Qxf5, Bxc6??, Qc5+, and all is over; so after Qxf5, we will have to play Be4 back losing an important pawn...} Na5 {a lucky moment for White; there will be no second chance...} 27. Be6 Qd8 28. Kf2 b5 29. Ke3 Nc4+ 30. Kd4 {very brave, although this can never win: I was trying to reach some point, where I could safely play Re8 under cover of the Bishop, and somehow try and penetrate the King into Blacks position; but after a simple c5+, all these aspirations would be over...} Na3 31. Re2 c6 32. Bb3 {also here, after c5+, I would have been ready to resign...} a5 33. Kd3 {something of a gamble: best here is d5, if Black can find it...} a4 34. Be6 c5 35. Bf7 b4 {although still holding advantage, this move throws most of it out of the window; absolutely winning was Ne7!, killing all of Whites' opportunities... also c4+ would still be winning...} 36. Re8 {no hesitation: Black has to give up the Queen... also after c4+, Kd2, Nb1+, Kc1, the only option is Qxe8 or mate...} Qxe8 37. Bxe8 Nb1 {Black is losing control: after still c4+, Kd2, Nb1+, Kc1, Nxc3, Be1, Nxa2, he can hold a very strong advantage...} 38. cxb4 cxb4 39. Bxa4 Nc3 40. Bb3 {the tables have turned completely; suddenly White is winning...} Ne7 41. Kc4 {better works a3, Nxf5, Be1!, Ne2...} Nc6 {but Black refuses Nxf5...} 42. Be1 Ne2 43. Bd2 {directly winning is Bxb4, Ng3 (Nxb4, Kxb4, Nxf4, a4, Nd5+, Kb5, and Blacks' Knight gets cornered), Bxd6, Nxf5, Kc5, with a hopeless position for Black...} Ng1 44. Kd5 {also here Bxb4, is better...} Nb8 {a bad move: better Nf3, Kxc6, Nxd2...} 45. Kxd6 {better Bxb4...} Nf3 46. Bxb4 Nxh4 47. Be6 Ng2 48. Bd2 h4 49. Bd5 {stronger is Bc4, h3, Bf1, Na6, a4...} h3 50. c4 {still easily winning, but Bxg2, hxg2, Be3 was more than sufficient...} Na6 51. c5 Nh4 52. Be6 h2 {White has succeeded in getting in trouble again; 52. c6 or better 51. Bxg2, were still easily winning...} 53. Bd5 Nb8 {luckily, Black is betting on the wrong Knight: after Nxf5+, Kd7, Nxc5+, Kc7, Ng3!, winning a Bishop for a pawn, Black might well be winning this...} 54. c6 {best here was Kc7, Na6+, Kb6, Nxc5, Kxc5, Nxf5, a4...} Nxf5+ {still, after Kc7, Ne7, Bh1 (Kxb8??, Nxd5 ends all for White), Nxc6, Kd7, White would easily be winning this: White however, produces a terrible move...} 55. Ke6 {now after Nxc6, a4 (Bxc6??, Nd4+, or Kxf5??, Ne7+; Bd5 falls and h2 promotes), White can start all over again from a fairly equal position; the chances for promotion are getting slimmer by the minute, and if Black can capture the a-pawn, even at the cost of a Knight, a draw is in sight; White would have simply no mating chances left against the cornered King; there were no problems on the clock for both...} Ng3 {they say, fortune favours the brave: Black is trying to win a piece here; unlucky for him, the bravely favour fortune... after Nxc6, a4 (the only one to keep sustaining leverage against h2), Nce7, Blacks' object is clear: eliminate the f- and g-pawn, in order to push our own; meanwhile we try to eliminate the Whites' LSB to bring about promotion chances; not a small task for White, against two Black Knights...} 56. c7 {injustice is harsh, so Black resigns: there is no stopping promotion and mate...}
