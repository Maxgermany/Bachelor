1. e4 e5 {I was black in this game.} 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Petroffs Defence.} 3. Nxe5 d6 {(3...Nxe4?  4.Qe2 Qe7 5.d4 )} 4. Nf3 Nxe4 {Its better in this opening as black to kick the Knight before taking the pawn} 5. d4 {I was expecting d3,  but this seems fine for white.} d5 {Taking more control of the center, freeing my KB and getting ready to castle.} 6. Nfd2 {This is one of the times you shouldn't move a piece twice in the opening. I think Bc4 or Nbd2 were better. } Nxd2 7. Bxd2 Bd6 8. Be3 {This time it's not so much moving the same piece twice that is bad, because the first was a capture, but this closes the e file, and puts his Bishop in a bad place. If he really wants the file closed, I prefer moving the Bishop or Queen to e2.} O-O 9. Bd3 Nd7 10. O-O Nf6 {Yes, I have moved this piece twice, but I thought that it was better placed at f6, and my development is equal.} 11. c3 {I think this is a bad move. Yes, it does block his Knight from c3, but also I think it is too passive. I think he should have done c4 instead.} b6 12. Nd2 c5 {If I didn't support this with b6,  I would have lost a pawn to dxc5.} 13. Qc2 Qc7 {I noticed I might have better chances on the kingside somewhere around here. } 14. Rfe1 {I think he should have done Nf3 instead. He might have been too focused on other things to notice my kingside threat.} Bxh2+ 15. Kh1 {I think Kf1 was better.} Bd7 {Developing, while keeping the bait on the string.} 16. g3 {He bites!} Bxg3 17. fxg3 Qxg3 {Now I threaten mate in two in different ways.} 18. Ref1 {He could have overlooked that that to rook was the only thing protecting his bishop. He might have been planning something like 19. Rxf6, gxf6 20. Rg1 pinning the queen to the king. But, I get to have a move, so..} Qxe3 {Taking the blundered piece. Any mate in twos could have been stopped.} 19. Rf3 Qe7 20. Kg1 c4 {Notice he can't play Bxh7, because of my Knight.} 21. Bf5 Rfe8 22. Rff1 Bxf5 23. Rxf5 {He lost another tempo here.} Rad8 24. Rff1 Ng4 {Setting up a fork on e3. Also threatening Qe2 then Qh2} 25. Nf3 {Blocks the mate threat, but..} Ne3 {.. misses the fork.} 26. Qe2 Nxf1 27. Qxe7 Rxe7 28. Kxf1 {His Kingside is looking very weak.} h6 {Preparing the kingside storm.} 29. Re1 {Not a good move here, with less material.} Rxe1+ 30. Kxe1 Re8+ {The d pawn doesn't need protecting, so I put my took on the only open file.} 31. Kd2 {I think Kf2 was better, because it puts his king closer to the passed pawns.} g5 32. a3 {Poor, because now I will get a passed pawn with any move of the b pawn. Then again, he doesn't have enough time to make a passed pawn.} f5 33. Ne5 Rxe5 {Now he cannot stop all 3 pawns from queening, even without the kings help} 34. dxe5 g4 35. Ke2 f4 36. Kf2 g3+ 37. Kg2 h5 38. Kf3 h4 {Note he cannot take the f pawn, because he will not be able to stop the g pawn} 39. Kg2 Kf7 {Waiting for him to move his king.} 40. Kh3 f3 41. Kxh4 {It was either this or Kg4. Here my log stopped, but we kept on playing until I checkmated him. I remember a few more moves.} g2 42. Kg3 g1=Q+ {0-1 Black wins. He didn't have much fight in him after he blundered piece. Although in my next game, Jesus Christ showed me that I shouldn't give up just because you are down.  Since I don't have a log for the next game, I'll explain it here. We opened with e4 c5 nc3 nc6 e5.(I'm white.) Just a bit later I won one of his queenside pawns, he got one off my kingside. Then I blundered a piece in a trade of minor pieces. Jesus helped me to realize just because I lost a piece, I'm not lost. I still have a chance. I just have to play my best, and focus. So, I launch a queenside attack. He launches a kingside attack a bit later. I had 3 vs 2 pawns on the queenside, He had 2 vs 1. He has an extra Bishop, we both have rooks and knights. He moves his Bishop diagonally next to his pawn, since I threaten it with my Knight, and I was also threatening his Bishop. I use a move or two to get my king up there, then capture his pawn with my Knight he checks from below with his rook. I noticed his Bishop was hanging, so I took it with my king. We discussed after the game,  and he realized he should have took the Knight with the Bishop, but he said he thought he could do that(check me to gain material)for some reason. I'm up a pawn now. My Knight supports my queening squares on the a and c files. He has advanced his h pawn to the the 2nd rank of mine. I push my a pawn to rank 6. He puts his took next to his pawn, on g2. He threatens Rg1. I move Rh1, he moves Rg1. His Knight guards both the h pawn and the rook. I take his pawn. He takes my rook. a7. Ra1. a8Q. Rxa8. Nxa8. My Knight is in the corner, his king is somewhere around g7. My pawn is around c3 on the c file, I think my king was 1 or 2 squares above. His pawn is on g6. I dash my Knight back to the pawn. I put my Knight in front of it. Move my king to d6. He moves. I move. He moves. In the end, I remember he couldn't lure my Knight from protecting g2, even after his Knight and king we're there. C8Q. He still hasn't moved his pawn to g2. At this point I remember the board clearly again. My king d6, queen c8, Knight h4, his Knight e3, king f3, pawn g3. Trying to find a move... I find Qc6+. He grabs his king. Hovers it over f4 and g4. He chooses g4. I move Ng2. He captures. I capture. Kh4 to protect the pawn. I move my king over and he resigned within a few moves.}
