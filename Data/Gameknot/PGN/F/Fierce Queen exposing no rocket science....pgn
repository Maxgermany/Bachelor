[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 {the French Defense: always inducing murderous thoughts in my chess play; this is probably one of the most cowardly openings, ever conceived in chess...} h6 {this reply is even worse than 1. ... e6: usually follows d5: White has many winning options there, as explained above; this prevents intrusion on square g5: which usually does not happen in this opening at all...} 3. Nf3 a6 {another useless move: White has no special plans on b5; just developing...} 4. Bd3 {preparing castling, and covering e4 against Nf6...} b6 {preparing Bb7, to gain influence in the center...} 5. O-O Bb7 6. c4 {for now, White has all the influence in the center: this might be the reason, that 2. ... d5 was the better move for Black...} d6 7. Nc3 {square d5, is from now on not penetrable for Black...} Nd7 8. b4 {taking away Nc5: Black is about to be crushed...} Qe7 {preparing 0-0-0: another example of castling into big trouble; Blacks' Kings wing is still undeveloped...} 9. Re1 {forcing castling long: a Queen in front of a King is always a problem...} e5 {a wrong provocation...} 10. dxe5 Nxe5 {of course, dxe5 is much safer...} 11. Bb2 {here is why...} Nxf3+ {practically forced: Nd5, is already a problem...} 12. Qxf3 {just adding, to the defense of pawn e4...} O-O-O {escaping into trouble...} 13. Nd5 {no rocket science here...} Qg5 {what can I say: the losing move?} 14. Qxf7 {not more, than winning a pawn: but there are many threats; f2-f4 for instance, or the pressure on g7: best for Black seems Bxd5, and take it from there; how unpleasant that may seem...} Nf6 {releasing the tensions on pawn g7, and contesting square d5: as such, a very good move; but for one small detail...} 15. Qxc7# {no rocket science involved...}
