1. e4 {The game start with a French Tarrasch so I'll start to make comments after the opening.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 c5 {Open variation.} 4. Ngf3 Nf6 5. e5 Nfd7 6. c3 Nc6 7. Bd3 Be7 8. O-O O-O {At this stage the computer give +0,04 for white but obviously the game just started and maybe this small advantage is the initiative... I don't really know..^__^} 9. Re1 {Place the rook in e file and let the space for the knight or bishop to go to a safe place. My opponent is a 2000 so I tried to play attacking but looking the back rows as well. And actually this f1 square would be very useful later on the game.... (pc doesn't like: -0,10?!?)} Qb6 {attacking the centre with strong piece. I'll lose a pawn like this...} 10. Nf1 {Prefer to create space for my dsb and replace my knight just beside his Renzo.} cxd4 11. cxd4 {At this stage the game is at -0,39 but I see some good possibility on the king side. So I go ahead with my plan..} f6 {Of course black spot the danger and start to counter play } 12. Qc2 fxe5 {f file opened but check on the way to oblige black Renzo on the corner} 13. Bxh7+ Kh8 {At this stage the game is -0,58!! And I have a pawn that will be loss and possibly a double pawn on f file!! But lost for lost I continue my original plan  attacking with all pieces available this king side!Of course black has a way to defend all of this.} 14. Qg6 {Here my first mistake spotted by the computer (-1,76) but I didn't want to double my pawn on f so I tried to keep my king  protected with a queen replacement and tempo lost.. Computer saying the best is to take dxe4 !! But already decided to leave this move to black so..} Rxf3 15. Qh5 {here I continuing covering my bishop and attacking the witched rook. there is a mate on the air if black made a wrong move! But still the pc give -2,58!! and I guess it' right! Feeling very uncomfortable but still hoping ^__^ } Nf6 {Of course the best!} 16. Qxf3 {And finally the rook is taken and saving the Renzo guards in their squares!} Nxd4 {And finally d4 went down attacking my lady. Notice that taking with the knight I can take e5 with my rook moved at move 9. I'm not sure about this move. } 17. Qh3 {Keeping the pressure on the king. forcing my opponent to take the bishop!} Nxh7 18. Rxe5 Kg8 {Unpinning the Knight and prevent the big canon Queen rook. } 19. Qd3 {Queen in the centre to prevent a check and /or rook attacking. still available combination on h file. Black doesn't have a lot of options to attack my guardians so I need to continue with the plan on pressuring him.} Bd6 20. Rh5 e5 {And here the black blunder which I guess give me the opportunity to win the game! From -3,19 the game pass to +3,25. Best move was:Nf6 20.  Rh4  e5  21. Be3 Qxb2  22. Bxd4 exd4  23. Rd1 Qxa2  24. Qxd4 a5  25. Ng3 a4  26. Re1 and keeping the piece up! I couldn't believe when I saw this and I was uncertain if take it or not!! What is black plan? But finally I took I breathe looked how I was leaving my troops behind: my rook will be in danger and a check can be received and dsb gone. However a queen and rook close to the king can be very nasty!  So let's go!!} 21. Qxh7+ Kf7 {I thought about Bh6 but leading no where and blocking my lady who needs space to express herself ;p ..} 22. Rg5 {Menacing a check and consequently trouble. black doesn't have many option to defend: Bf7 or Ne5} Ne6 {Second option bringing back some help for the king attacking the rook and defending the pawn! however with move block black lsb. } 23. Rf5+ {Here I thought: if black move on the black square I can activate my dsb and put more pressure and with 3 pieces chasing the Renzo maybe I can make it... but black is an expert player and found a beautiful way to get out of this difficult situation. So I start my chase for some material or a a winning move..} Ke8 24. Qg8+ Kd7 25. Qf7+ Kc6 26. Qe8+ {here computer give +1,94} Bd7 27. Qxa8 {second rook grabbed but the queen now is on the opposite corner of his companion!!! Can she manage to help him in case of danger?} Nc7 {Chapeau to Jack!! What a defend!! menacing the queen and attacking my rook!I didn't see this arriving!} 28. Qg8 {back on the king side where a small target is still available to open the way to my kings pawns. } Bxf5 29. Qxg7 {Mistake the computer says!! best it says would have been : 29. Bd2  Kb5  30. a4+ Ka6  31. Qxg7 Qc6  32. Ne3 Be6  33. Qh7 e4  34. Bc3 Qd7  35. Qh5 Kb6  36. Bd4+ Bc5  37. a5+ Kc6.  But I have long term plan and my king is protected enough and Bd2 can still be done.} Bd3 30. Be3 Qxb2 {pawn lost as preview..} 31. Rc1+ Bc4 {Covering the check but still pinned and safe the menace to my last cowboy still on f1 after 21 moves!!} 32. h4 {So here I go! 5 moves to the joy! I will have the time? For computer is a mistake!!! 32. Ng3  b5  33. Nf5 d4  34. Bg5 Qa3  35. Nxd6 Qxd6  36. a4 a6  37. Be7 Qe6  38. axb5+ axb5} Qxa2 {So black take the pawn and computer says mistake! the game appears balanced: white on king side and black on the queen one! But my pawn already start his run!! Run Forrest Run!!} 33. h5 Ne6 {black attack my lady and bring some forces to prevent the promotion. But his pieces are on the the other side and the long black diagonal is still free.} 34. Qg4 {keeping the pressure on the knight and consider as well the exchange bishop rook.} Kd7 35. h6 {-2!} e4 {here many possibility and black almost safe the position. I saw a sacrifice the lady to approach Forrest but then his promotion will be on white square which can be covered by bishop and queen, so not a good plan.And now the piece pinned is the knight and not the bishop} 36. Bd4 {Considered the pin I take the long diagonal!and protect case promotion! For pc is a mistake!!!Seriously I don't understand some time the way the computer is thinking!!for him the best is:h7 Be5  37. Qf5 Bh8  38. Nd2 Ke7  39. Nxc4 dxc4  40. Bc5+ Nxc5  41. Qxc5+ Kf7  42. Qd5+ Ke7  43. Qxb7+ Kf6  44. Qc6+ Kg7  45. Qc7+ Kg6  46. Rxc4??  Anyway chess the beauty of chess is that the possibility are millions!!} Bxf1 {black tempting by taking the piece and take the initiative!! I prefer a promotion indeed!} 37. h7 {-1!!} Qd2 {and here black attack!! Would I resist? points for pc is  +3,79} 38. Rd1 {Attacking and protecting dsb. he needs to survive standing in that position the priest.} Qe2 {Forced queen exchange!} 39. Qxe2 Bxe2 40. Rd2 Nxd4 {Black won a piece and if I take the knight all my plan would have been useless. I see the trap and give the ok to Forrest!} 41. h8=Q {He did it! Good one Forrest, deserved promotion for your effort ^__^. Now Renzo with his new lady is another man ;P.  Black has 3 pieces while white only 2. Black has a free highway on queen side to promote as well. Tricky situation but I need to keep the initiative!!} Bc5 42. Rxd4 Bxd4 43. Qxd4 {Double attack on with a check or pawn take. My plan now is to reduce black movement and possibly leave just one pawn on file b.} Kc6 44. Qxa7 b6 {here I feel quite comfortable though I don't' have to commit any mistake and precipitate my attack.  So looking the board I said I need to stop theses pawns advance and consequently his king and if another Forrest make another marathon it will done.} 45. Qa4+ {Intermediate check for queen relocation..} b5 46. Qd4 {Voilà the queen in the centre.now black doesn't have many options..} Kd6 47. Kh2 {And Renzo said is time to enter in action as well after 39 moves sitting on his armchair. } Kc6 48. Kh3 {I considered Bf1 and thoguth it would be good to have Renzo on the front of the pawn. but black has finished his munitions ;°} Kd6 {And after this one black resign!  A good battle which brought my first victory against an expert player. I got lucky as he blundered at move 20 but still is a great satisfaction.
