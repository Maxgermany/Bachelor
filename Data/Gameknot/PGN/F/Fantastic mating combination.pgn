1. e4 Na6 {Unusual.  White has to decide whether to give up his bishop (usually slightly stronger than the knight), in return for doubling blacks pawns.} 2. Bxa6 bxa6 3. d4 c5 {Taking doesn't seem to do much good, so Be3 pretty much forces the swap off, whilst centralising the bishop.} 4. Be3 cxd4 5. Bxd4 Qa5+ 6. c3 e6 7. a4 {Getting pawns to a5 and b4 seems to lock down the dark squares.} Qc7 8. Qh5 Ne7 9. Nf3 Qc4 10. Na3 {Ne5 should have been played.  Now black could take on a4, but risks a discovered attack, and his own a-pawns are weak.} Qc7 11. a5 Ng6 12. O-O Ne7 {Ng5 would be best, but white tries to force the issue.} 13. Bc5 Qb8 14. Ra2 {An idle threat dealt with, now black continues to dally around to get rid of the bishop.} Ng8 15. Bd6 {Unsound, but white thought he would have chances over the board by bringing in Na3 whilst keeping the tempo.} Qxd6 16. Nc4 Qc6 {Mistake.} 17. Nfe5 Qc5 18. Qxf7+ Kd8 19. Rd1 Ne7 20. b4 Qb5 21. Rad2 Rb8 {There was no good way out, but this move allows a brilliant mate in 6 - can you see it?} 22. Qe8+ {!!} Kxe8 23. Nd6+ Kd8 {White could recapture the queen, but he has something better.} 24. Nef7+ Kc7 25. Ne8+ {Infiltration behind enemy lines!} Kb7 26. Nd8+ {An aesthetically pleasing position.} Ka8 27. Nc7# {And mate.  White's Knights seem to have danced around with impunity.}
