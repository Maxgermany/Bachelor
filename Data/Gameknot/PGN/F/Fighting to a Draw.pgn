[Round "1"]
[White "Richard Reti "]
[Black "Doctor Karel Treybal "]
[Opening "Reti opening (A05)"]

1. Nf3 {When Reti popularized the hyper-modern opening named after him (1 Nf3), he had some profound positional concepts in mind, such as controlling the center from the wings instead of attacking it with pawns. But when confronted with such admirable tacticians as Dr. Treybal, the game became as wild as anything arising out of the King's Gambit.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 c5 4. Bg2 Nc6 5. O-O Be7 6. Nc3 d5 {Dr. Treybal, as black, occupies the center with pawns, in a classical style. Meanwhile, Reti tries to undermine it from the wings, a typical hyper-modern strategy.} 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. Nxd5 exd5 {Also feasible is 8 ... Qxd5 to avoid the isolated pawn. If then, 9 d3 O-O 10 Be3 Qh5 is roughly equal.} 9. d4 c4 {Here, black boldly aims for a queen-side pawn majority at the expense of giving white control of the center.} 10. b3 O-O 11. bxc4 dxc4 12. d5 Nb4 13. Ne5 Qc7 14. f4 Bf5 15. e4 f6 16. a3 {The game now takes a critical turn. Black reckoned on 16 exf fxe 17 fxe Qxe5 18 Bf4 Qxf5 19 d6 Qc5 20 Kh1 Rfd8 21 d7 Nd3 22 Bxb7 Rxd7! threatening not only Rxb7 but Nf2 as well.} Bc5+ 17. Kh1 fxe5 18. axb4 Bd4 {18 ... Bd4, the only way to save one of the bishops.} 19. exf5 Bxa1 20. d6 Qd7 21. fxe5 Rxf5 22. Rxf5 Qxf5 23. Bf4 Bxe5 24. Bxb7 {On 24 Qd5 Kh8 the bishop on e5 is immune owing to the mate threat on the back rank by Qb1.} Bxf4 25. Bxa8 Bxd6 {The bishop is again untouchable, owing to Qf1#.} 26. Qd5+ Qxd5+ 27. Bxd5+ Kf8 28. Bxc4 Bxb4 29. Kg2 Ke7 {Another great fighting draw. Black cannot make progress despite the extra pawn on a7, owing to opposite-colored bishops.}
