1. e4 {I was Black in this mini-tournament game} c5 {I prefer the Sicilian over the "principled" e5, since c5 controls the same d4 square with a less important pawn} 2. Nf3 d6 3. c3 {This is "delayed Alapin," rather than normal Alapin where White plays c3 on the second move. I think Alapin is stronger than delayed Alapin since Black can stall d4 unlike if White had played c3 on move 2} Nf6 4. Be2 {There is an opening trap where White plays Nxe4?? and White wins with Qa4  winning the knight. Another line is h3 (preventing Bg4) followed by Bd3 where White wants the bishop on c2 to defend e4 before playing d4.} Nc6 {I think g6 was a better move because I didn't realize that White could play d4 here. After d4, Nxe4 is impossible because of d5 followed by Qa4  winning the e4-knight after the c6-knight moves} 5. d3 {White must not have realized the chance to expand the centre, and plays a passive move.} e6 {I thought about developing g6 Bg7 with a Dragon-setup, but since I'm not familiar with this opening, I decided to play something a little more solid} 6. O-O Be7 7. Re1 O-O 8. Bf1 {This move gets the bad bishop out of the way while defending the kingside, and now White can play d4 here, although it isn't as strong as it would have been on move 5, since White has wasted a tempo playing d3?!} b6 9. d4 {I played b6 so that I could recapture c5 with a b-pawn, which brings a flank pawn to the center, rather than playing dxc5, which weakens my center and goes into a drawish position where the pawn structures are symmetrical} d5 {I wasn't comfortable with White's superior center, so I thought my best chance of containing the center is to challenge it, which goes into a type of French structure} 10. e5 Nd7 {Now this is sort of like a French Advance (e4 e6 d4 d5 e5 c5 c3), but there are a lot of differences. I was able to develop my kingside knight, unlike in French Advance where it is blocked by e5. I have a pawn on b6 instead of a queen, which strengthens my center. White has undeveloped his bishop, which is dubious in this type of opening. Because of these differences, I would prefer my position.} 11. Bf4 f6 {Normally Black would attack on the queenside with pawns, but here I have a chance to undermine White's center, a common move in the French.} 12. Nbd2 {I think exf6 was better, after Nxf6 Ng5, my e-pawn is very weak, and I'd have to play a move like Ne4} fxe5 13. Bxe5 {forced since I'm threatening Rxf4, White's bishop is almost like a pawn now.} Qe8 {I wanted to maneuver my pieces to the kingside to start an attack} 14. Bd3 {White's bishop aims at my kingside} Ndxe5 15. Nxe5 Nxe5 16. dxe5 {After the series of exchanges, my center and queenside seem to be impenetrable, so all the play of this game will take place on the kingside where I have a strong open f-file. White's open d-file doesn't do him any good} Qf7 17. Nf3 g5 {Here was where I got carried away with an illusory attack. g5 is a serious weakening move, and White has adequate defenders, but I couldn't see any other way to generate play on the kingside} 18. h3 h5 19. Re2 {White is on the defense for now, but after my attack fades, I'll be left with a very weakened kingside} Bb7 {I played this move so I could have a bishop aiming at White's kingside (where else does this bishop go?) If I start a strong attack on the kingside, then I could end up with d4 threats that would reveal some kind of tactic on the kingside. I also connect my rooks so my a-rook can join the attack on White's kingside} 20. Qc2 Qg7 {I wanted to make room for my rooks to double on the f-file with Rf4 Raf8.} 21. Bg6 {Because of my overextension of pawns, White's pieces can go annoyingly in my territory.} Ba6 {I was also contemplating Qa6 and g4, but I decided to move my bishop again so it would have a clear path, rather than blocked by d5} 22. Re3 g4 {My overextension isn't pretty, and I think Qa6 is better} 23. hxg4 hxg4 24. Nh2 Bg5 {My g-pawn is under serious pressure, so I need a counter-threat since Rf4 is not an adequate defense, my rook could easily get chased off the 4th rank} 25. Rg3 {This doesn't win the pawn because of my next move. Re1 was much better and wins the pawn, in which my only hope would be to go for a do or die attack on the kingside} Bh4 26. Rxg4 Bxf2+ {Although White missed his chance to win my overextended pawn, I'm still in trouble because of the open file to my king.} 27. Kh1 {If Qxf2, then Rxf2 Bh7  Kxh7 Rxg7  Kxg7 Kxf2 and material is still even, but bishops are usually better than knights in open positions} Kh8 {Only move since White is threatening discovered attacks on the g-file} 28. g3 {White has no useful discovered attacks now, since the bishop has nothing to attack and my queen can simply move. Although Bd3 Bxd3 Qxd3 increases the pressure on my king with tempo. The text move threatens Rh4  Kg8 Bh7  Kf7 Qxf2 } Be3 {I stop the threat, while preparing to get my bishop back to my king to defend. Overextending my pawns to try for an illusory attack was not a good idea, as you can see my king is very weak. This would be a different story if my king was safe on the queenside, because then White's king would be weak and the open kingside files would benefit me, I'd probably win White's g-pawn and have a winning endgame, but here my king cannot escape to safety. I was very lucky to have won this position.} 29. Bd3 {If White had tried Rh4  Kg8 Bh7  then my king would only have an easier time escaping to the queenside} Bxd3 30. Qxd3 {Rxg7 loses a piece after Bxc2} Bg5 {The only way to defend my queen and bishop since Qh6 allows Rh4} 31. Re1 {This defend e5, but Nf3 may have been a better way to do so} Qh6 {This was where I started to get out of danger, and I was ready to walk my king all the way to the queenside, where I'd be safe and able to continue my kingside attack, and I'm also threatening Rf2 threatening Qxh2#, so I think my position has recovered and I'm good here} 32. Kg2 {32.Kg2?? totally loses for White. Kg1 was a simple way to defend the threat because after Rf2, White simply plays Nf3 and I have two pieces under attack. In this continuation, I can play Rf2 with tempo, and White cannot defend} Rf2+ {Tactics like this are often missed because a lot of people don't analyse the board thoroughly. A grandmaster would probably resign here since he'd be able to see that he is totally lost. White probably knows he is lost, but the sudden change of game probably shocked him.} 33. Kxf2 Qxh2+ 34. Kf3 {Kf1 still allows Rf8 , and White's king is just as dead} Rf8+ 35. Rf4 Bxf4 {Here I'm threatening 36...Bxg3  37.Ke3 Qf2# (or 37.Kg4 Qh4#), and taking the bishop also results in immediate mate (which is what happened in the game) If White tries to get out of mate with 36.Kg4, then 36...Bxg3 threatens Qh4#, and 37.Qxg3 loses to Rg8  where I win the queen and have an easily won game. 36.Kg4 Bxg3 37.Rh1 stalls the loss, but the concentrated power of my queen and rook is enough to finish off White easily. 36.Kg4 Bxg3 37.Kg5 Qh4  38.Kg6 Qg4  39.Kh6 Bf4# is forced mate, but White's game continuation got mated quickly.} 36. gxf4 Rxf4+ 37. Ke3 Qf2# {I hope you enjoyed this crazy game, and you should think twice before overextending your kingside, since I got into deep trouble around move 25}
