1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bd3 {?! Awkwardly placed bishop blocks white's queen  pawn. Better continuations include main lines of the Petroff, 3. Nc3 or 3.  Nxe5. } Nc6 4. c3 d5 5. Bb5 {The white bishop finds a better square, but a  tempo is lost. } Bd6 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. Bxc6+ {?! The exchange opens the a6-f1  diagonal for black's bishop. } bxc6 8. O-O O-O 9. d4 e4 {! Black begins a  kingside attack. } 10. Ne1 {?? White blunders the exchange by blocking the f1  rook.  Better is 10. Ne5. } Ba6 11. Nd2 Bxf1 12. Nxf1 f5 13. Qe2 f4 {?! Perhaps too ambitious. Rybka prefers 13...Qf6. } 14. Qxe4 {Her majesty  ingests the poisoned black pawn, which seals white's fate. Much better is 14.  c4. } Re8 15. Qd3 Rxe1 16. g3 {? Hastens the inevitable by weakening  white's king. } Qd7 {! The black queen prepares to exploit the weak light  squares around the enemy king. } 17. Kg2 Rae8 18. Kf3 fxg3 19. fxg3 Qf7+ {White resigns, mate in 7. }
