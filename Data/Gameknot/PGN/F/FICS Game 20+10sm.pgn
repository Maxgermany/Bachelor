[Opening "Petrov (C43), modern (Steinitz) attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Petroff's Defence.  A fairly flexible system for Black that I sometimes adopt to avoid going into the Ruy Lopez.} 3. d4 {The Steinitz Attack.} d6 {At this point, it would be most common (and recommended) for Black to pick up one of the pawns.  We'll see why shortly.} 4. dxe5 dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {White trades Queens to ensure Black can never castle.  An exposed king in a half-open centre is likely to cause trouble for Black.  Taking a pawn back at move 3, or allowing the pawn taken in move 4 to be gambitted, could have prevented a lot of Black's trouble, with the capture being probably slightly better.} 6. Nxe5 Be6 {Black must scramble to prevent Nxf7+!.  Doing it this way also somewhat aids development.} 7. Nc3 Bc5 8. Bg5 h6 {Black could also have given some thought to Nd7 to push away (or trade) the aggravating knight at e5 and taking him a step closer to connecting his rooks.} 9. O-O-O+ {A nice move for White that piles a little more pressure on Black} Ke7 10. Bxf6+ Kxf6 {An exchange of minor pieces.  Black opts to not double his pawns, at the expense of further exposing his king (although it should be relatively comfortable for the time being).  Black's position is a little ragged, but for now he seems to be holding on reasonably well.} 11. f4 Be3+ 12. Kb1 Bxf4 {Black wins back the pawn he has been down for the last ten moves and is starting to coordinate against White's kingside.  After 11. f4 it is now White who is responding to threats; if Black wants this to continue he will need to find a way to develop his rooks quickly and maintain the initiative.} 13. Nd3 Bg4 {? Slightly uncertain.  The idea of countering an attack on the bishop with one on the rook is fine, but after 14. Nxf4 Bxd1 15. Nxd1, Black has traded two bishops for a rook, has no active pieces and his king is once again wide open.  Perhaps 13. ... Be5 was better, offering a trade, or Bd6, a less active but more secure post that retains the useful bishop pair.} 14. Be2 {As before, I prefer Nxf4, with a White advantage, to a move that retains equality.} Bxe2 15. Nxe2 Bg5 {Black's bishop is forced back anyway.  He has probably come out the worse for the fight despite material equality, as most of his remaining army is stuck at home.} 16. Rhf1+ Kg6 17. Ne5+ Kh7 18. Rxf7 {The Black king has been squeezed into a corner.  The White pieces are taking up strong positions in the Black half of the board and are threatening to overwhelm the defenders in short order, due in no small part to Black's failure to develop his Queenside, which itself was a direct result of Black allowing White to force a recapture by the Black king back on move 5.} Re8 {Black's development is hampered by his inability to bring out his queenside knight without disadvantage (either doubling his pawns via Nc6 Nxc6 bx6 or sticking it out of the action via Na6).  This option, while providing no long-term advantage, does offer a threat on the e5 knight and the e4 pawn, but it seems unlikely snatching back pawns is going to offer serious hope for Black with half of his remaining men sat at home while White's forces swarm.} 19. Nd7 Rxe4 {Black takes a more aggressive line over initiating the knight trade, perhaps gaining by forcing the e2 knight to move.} 20. Nc3 {A counter-threat to the rook that disrupts Black's plans to bring about attacks of his own using the tempo gained by forcing the knight to move.} Re7 {Black now tries to initiate a rook trade, perhaps hoping that he can overpower White's knight with his bishop in a traded-down endgame.} 21. Rxe7 Bxe7 22. Nxb8 Rxb8 23. Rd7 Rf8 {Black hopes to sneak a back-rank mate, but this move offers little else to recommend it (the rook is slightly better placed here, but that's about it).  Bd6 might have been better.} 24. a3 Bd6 25. h3 Rf2 {Black moves to the seventh to begin an attack on the White kingside pawns.  It will take him several moves to get behind and catch them.} 26. Nd5 {A good move that should give White plenty of opportunity to damage the Black pawns and pull up a winning advantage, as Black is about to have his bishop's protector stripped away.} Rxg2 {?! Black was in difficulties after 26. Nd5, which this move does little to rectify.  He could instead have opted for Bc5, but it doesn't do much better after 27. Rxc7.  Black just can't defend those pawns and will suffer for it.} 27. Nxc7 Rg1+ {A petty check that acheives little and only delays the inevitable.} 28. Ka2 Bxc7 29. Rxc7 Rg2 {With the idea of winning the c-pawn, but White's king guarantees Black cannot win back his fallen pawns like this.  As it stands, barring a blunder from White, he's probably playing to draw now.} 30. Kb3 {Activating the king.} Rg3+ 31. c3 Rxh3 32. Rxb7 a5 {A wasted move, really, although forcing the White rook to move ensures no tempo is lost; Black ought to be activating his own king and perhaps trying to mobilise his pawns as a counterthreat.  Forcing the White rook towards the middle of the board does it no harm at all.} 33. Ka4 Rh5 {ï»¿Temporarily protecting the a-pawn, but it will fall eventually.  Black should be able to trade rooks and move his h-pawn down the board to queen first.} 34. b4 Rh4 {??  White offers a new threat to the pawn in place of the king, and Black responds to it horribly. axb5 was much better.} 35. Kxa5 Rh3 {There really isn't much Black can do now except try to pick up pawns while waiting for White to make a mistake.  The White king is comfortably sheltered by his pawns, the White rook can exert pressure on the Black king, and Black's position is overall weak.  He's lost the tempo he needed to win the promotion race.} 36. Rc7 h5 37. b5 Rf3 {The game is now a race to see who can promote first.  White has a decisive advantage.} 38. b6 Rf5+ 39. Ka6 Rf8 {Black's rook takes up positions on the back rank, but it can't save him.  The time lost by having to move his rook away from the h-file is going to kill him off (if he wasn't already dead.)  White is more than happy to trade his b-pawn for Black's rook.} 40. b7 h4 41. Ka7 {Also effective was Rc8, after which promotion cannot be stopped for more than one move.} h3 42. Rc4 Kg8 43. Rh4 Rf7 44. Rxh3 g6 45. a4 {Not that it matters, but Ka8 isprobably the best move.} Kg7 46. Ka8 Rf8+ 47. b8=Q Rxb8+ 48. Kxb8 g5 49. Rg3 Kg6 50. a5 g4 51. a6 Kg5 52. a7 Kf4 53. Rxg4+ Kxg4 54. a8=Q {}
