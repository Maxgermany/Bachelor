[Opening "French (C00), Reti (Spielmann) variation"]

1. e4 {I annotated my other game against mrcollio in this mini-tournament a little while ago. I was playing extra carefully in this, the return match, because I knew he would be after revenge!} e6 {I play the French Defence, my favourite response to 1.e4.} 2. b3 {If my opponent wanted to get me "out of the book" he has certainly managed it! This is the Reti/Spielmann Variation, very rare in comparison the the main line 2.d4, and I had never seen it before in my life. Not a good start.} d5 {I simply continued with the core idea of the French Defence, pretending it was the main line. This is the most usual response to the Reti/Spielmann Variation as well.} 3. e5 Ne7 4. Nf3 Nd7 5. Bb5 {The game broadens into a more usual French formation - though still a far cry from main line French Defence.} c6 {Black's position is unfortunately very cramped, with both bishops completely blocked in. In particular, Black's light'squared bishop is stuck behind Black's c- and e- pawns, as well as his d2-knight - at least Black's dark-squared bishop has an easy exit after Ng6. However, I was hoping to target the pawn on e5, which was not currently protected by any other pawns: if this pawn falls, Black can expand his cramped postion.} 6. Be2 g6 {Aiming to fianchetto Black's dark-squared bishop and start building up pressure on the e5-pawn.} 7. Bb2 Bg7 8. d4 {White throws a spanner in the works, shoring up his e-pawn with another pawn. I could almost see my position recoiling before my eyes from the constricting advance of the d-pawn.} c5 {So I unveil the time-honoured way of undermining the d-pawn in the main line French Defence.} 9. dxc5 {And White allows Black to undermine his pawn formation without a struggle, leaving the e5-pawn weak again! Excellent! I could see a glimmer of daylight.} Nxc5 10. Na3 Qa5+ 11. Nd2 {Now the knight is pinned. Black can play 11...Nd7 to place incredible pressure on the e5-pawn...} Ne4 {...or put more pressure on the pinned knight on d2 - a strategy with a lower probability of success, but one which will reap greater rewards if it does succeed - namely, the d2-knight.} 12. Bb5+ Nc6 13. Bxc6+ bxc6 14. Qe2 Bh6 15. Bc1 Qc3 {Black is trying to stretch White's defences and overwork his pieces. Notice that attention has completely shifted from the e5-pawn to the d2-knight!} 16. Rb1 a5 17. f3 Ba6 {Complicating the position, adding more attack lines...all part of the effort to over-stretch White's defences. As White's king is defending the d2-knight, the king is as bound to the knight as the knight is bound to the king! And if the king is stuck in the centre, Black has an advantage.} 18. Qd1 Nxd2 {I judged that it was time to begin exchanging on d2.} 19. Bxd2 Bxd2+ 20. Qxd2 Qc5 21. Qc1 Rb8 22. c3 Bd3 {Black starts attacking White's queenside pawns, in an attempt to gain material.} 23. Ra1 O-O 24. Qd2 Bf5 25. g4 {This looks like a mistake by White: it appears to lose him a pawn.} Qxa3 26. gxf5 exf5 {And now White is behind by a pawn.} 27. O-O {It appears to me that White's exposed kingside can offer White's king no more protection than the centre can: at best this was a waste of a move.} Qc5+ 28. Kg2 Kg7 29. Rac1 Rfe8 30. Rfe1 {That's the way I like my opponent's rooks to be: tied down to their pawns.} Qe7 {Suddenly attention shifts. Now the pressure starts piling up against - you've guessed it - the e5-pawn. The e5-pawn is under multiple attacks for the second time in the game.} 31. Qf4 Qe6 32. h4 {An aggressive pawn move: perhaps White is going in for an attack on Black's kingside.} Re7 33. Kh3 h6 34. Rc2 Rbe8 35. Rce2 {Ouch, the pressure there really is crippling. A judicious attack from the side, say with ...f6, should make the e5-pawn fall in the near future...I hoped... . But, even should this fail, White's rooks are tied down nicely, which may allow me to attack in some other areas...} Kh7 {Clearing the way for 36...f6, as 35...f6 36.exf6  is check and throws a spanner in Black's works.} 36. Qg3 f6 37. exf6 Qxf6 {If the queen was on e8, and the rooks on e7 and e6, Black's battery could win White's rook. As it is Black must content himself with recapturing the pawn. After having played f6 I realised that I would lose queen for rook thanks to the irritating f6-pawn unless I took it with my queen.} 38. Re2xe7+ Rxe7 39. f4 Rxe1 40. Qxe1 {Mass exchanges, and all four rooks disappear.} g5 41. fxg5 hxg5 42. hxg5 Qxg5 {Black has a passed pawn. I had high hopes for turning this into a queen, but this was by no means easy, as queen-and-pawn endings like this one are much more unstable and unpredictable than rook-and-pawn endgames.} 43. Qh4+ Qxh4+ 44. Kxh4 {White has allowed the queens to be exchanged off, which seems to be playing into my hands as I have an extra passed pawn.} Kg6 45. Kg3 Kg5 {Using the opposition between the two kings, I am pushing my opponent's king back. This should be an easy promotion.} 46. Kf3 f4 47. a4 {I had overlooked that. 48.b4 could cause a few problems for Black.} c5 48. b4 axb4 49. cxb4 cxb4 {Excellent! A pawn race! Who will promote first...?} 50. a5 b3 51. a6 b2 52. a7 b1=Q 53. a8=Q {Back to a queen-and-pawn endgame...but now Black is ahead by TWO passed pawns.} Qe4+ 54. Kf2 Qe3+ 55. Kf1 Qd3+ 56. Kf2 d4 57. Qd5+ Kg4 58. Qg2+ {Aha! A costly error by White!} Qg3+ {White resigned. He cannot avoid a queen exchange, after which Black's two passed pawns will be unstoppable.}
