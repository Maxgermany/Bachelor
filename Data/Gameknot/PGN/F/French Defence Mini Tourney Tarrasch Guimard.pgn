1. e4 {My opponent annotates a large number of games and I would be interested to see what he thought of this as I have enjoyed a number of his annotations.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {The tarrasch. I played this on the grounds it's the variation i least like to play against when I am black in a french. It will never refute the french but it can be very hard to create counterplay against it.} Nc6 {The Guimard. It has a dubious reputation and it blocks the ...c5 break, but it can't be bad to simply develop a piece. I tried to keep the position closed as I think Black may find his position a bit "gummed up" if he isn't too careful. } 4. Ngf3 {I am playing for the so-called "Universal system": I don't know any theory so I just develop my pieces on natural squares and hope for the best!  4. c3 e5 5. dxe5 Nxe5 6. Ngf3 Nxf3  7. Nxf3 Nf6 With a slight plus for white according to Fritz, but with the e5 break obtained and even development, it feels pretty level to me. Given that 3...Nc6 presumably aims for a quick ...e6-e5 it feels wrong to let black get it in so quickly. } Nf6 5. e5 {This just felt ok: I was completely out of book, and after this game I left wondering if I am better just playing chess than studying theory - I liked my position and I had to play moves based on my assessment of the position, giving me a deeper feel for it cf learned theory.} Nd7 6. Bd3 {I am trying to argue that Black has misplaced his knight.} Nb4 {I found out after that this is theory: black gains a tempo for ...c5, but it seems very much like a normal Tarrasch. 6... f6 7. Ng5 Ndxe5 8. dxe5 fxg5 9. Qh5  g6 10. Bxg6  Kd7 11. f4 gxf4 12. Bd3 Nb4 13. Nf3 Nxd3  14. cxd3 Qe8 With equality according to Fritz, but long-term I would prefer white: the f4 pawn looks ropey and Black will have to mess about with his king to get the Bishop out. 15. Qh4 Qg6 16. O-O Qxd3 17. Bxf4 Bc5  18. Kh1 c6 With a slight edge to white, although black will have counter-chances against the white king so it's playable. } 7. Be2 c5 {After this it becomes like a normal tarrasch.} 8. c3 Nc6 9. O-O Qb6 {Black pressures d4, what will become the base of white's pawn-chain to gain time for development. White can either organise a king-side attack or play down the c-file if it is opened.} 10. Nb3 {Protecting d4 and eyeing up c5 as well as freeing the path of the dark-squared bishop so white can complete his development. Contrast this with the black position and the hemmed-in light-squared bishop and inative d7 knight: these two pieces don't appear to have any obvious squares to go to.} cxd4 {10... c4 11. Nbd2 Qa5 (11... f6 12. exf6 Nxf6) 12. b4 And white it better. } 11. cxd4 a5 {Black is seeking to put pressure on the base of white's pawn-chain by attacking the knight, but he doesn't seem to have enough to disrupt white's play. } 12. a4 {Obligatory really, but it's nothing to worry about as I cannot see how black can utilise the outpost on b4.  } Be7 {12... h6 Is gospel according to Fritz. It's hard to see why on the grounds I think the Bishop belongs on e3, discouraging any ...f6...e5 break by Black by pointing at the queen and overprotecting d4 and by extension the c5 outpost too.  12... Bb4 Prevents the rook going to e1, perhaps making ...f6 easier, but black's king-side looks a bit draughty 13.Qc2 with a plan of playing on the king-side with Nf3-g5 or down the c-file. } 13. Bb5 {This opens the e-file for the white rook and allows white to complete development harmoniously. The B can always drop back to d3 if needs must. } O-O 14. Re1 {This seemed like the best square for the rook. In the event of an ...e6-e5 break it points at the e6 pawn.} f6 {I am not convinced about this as black just seems to get left with a weak e6 pawn and even if he gets ...e6-e5 in, he'll get an IQP in return. However, it's hard to see a constructive plan for black here - he's solid but passive and by extension worse: As Mihai Suba said, chess is a dynamic game and black seems to lack dynamism. } 15. exf6 Nxf6 {After white's next, the e5 break is off the cards so I am not sure if the alternative captures help at all.} 16. Be3 {Pointing this at the queen, and reinforcing control over c5. It also rules out any ...e5 break for the time being. White will line up on the c-file and occupy c5 and e5 with knights if given the chance. } Bb4 {16... Ng4 17. Rc1 Bb4 18. Bd2 Nxf2 19. Kxf2 Nxd4 20. Be3 Bxe1  21. Qxe1 Nxf3 22. Bxb6 Nxe1  23. Kxe1 e5 24. Bxa5 When white is winning, but I'd hate to play this in practice. Connected passed pawns like that make me nervous. } 17. Bd2 {Exchanging the dark-squared bishops is a major white objective in this kind of position given black's weak c5 and e5 squares. } Be7 {17... Bxd2 18. Qxd2 Ne4 19. Qc2 Leaves white with a slight but enduring advantage owing to the weak dark squares - white usually aims to exchange dark-squared bishops in this kind of line.  17... Bd6 18. Ng5 Re8 19. Qc2 h6 20. Nf3 With potential play on both sides of the board for white. A spatial plus means white can alternate play on both wings when black will struggle to regroup his forces in time. } 18. Rc1 {Pressing against c6} Ne4 {?! In view of what follows (i.e. a clear white plus) this has to be regarded as dubious, although white was slightly better in any case. 18... Bd6 19. Bxc6 bxc6 20. Ne5 Ne4 21. Rxc6  With a slight plus for white as he has annoying threats on the c-file. 18... Bd7 19. Ne5, again with a slight plus } 19. Be3 Bd7 {Alternative variation: 19... Bb4 20. Re2  And white continues along the same lines as the game. } 20. Ne5 Be8 {20... Nxf2 Does not work 21. Nxd7 Nxd1 22. Nxb6  20... Nxe5 21. dxe5 Qd8 22. Qg4 Note how the space advantage can result in play on both wings...Rf5 23. f3 Ng5 24. f4 Bb4 25. Re2 Nf7 26. Nd4 Nh6 27. Qh3 Bxb5 28. axb5 Rc8 29. Rec2 With a dominating position for white. } 21. f3 {The black knight has no decent square to retreat to.} Ng5 {21... Nd6 22. Bxc6 Bxc6 23. Nc5 With a plus for white after 23...Nc4 or 23...Nf5 - Black has counterplay compared with the game, making this arguably a better continuation. } 22. Bxc6 {Switching the space advantage into a concrete positional one. Black now has two pawn weaknesses, which would cause him trouble in any endgame.} Bxc6 {22... Nxf3  23. Nxf3 Bxc6 24. Nc5 Bxc5 25. dxc5 Qxb2 26. Bd4 Qb4 27. Rb1 Qc4 28. Ne5 Qa6 29. Qg4 With an overwhelming position for white. Noteworthy is how fast black goes downhill.  22... bxc6 23. Nc5 Is pretty much the game continuation. } 23. Nc5 Bxc5 {Alternative variation: 23... Qxb2 24. Rb1 Qa2 25. Re2 And black will have to shed material to rescue the queen. } 24. Rxc5 {Envisioning a lining up of heavy artillery on the c-file.} Nf7 25. Nxc6 bxc6 {Creating another backward pawn on an open file.} 26. Qc2 {In the universal system white often sacs the d-pawn for c-file control. Also noteworthy is all the dark squares the white bishop can settle on. } Ra6 {26... Qb4 Gives white chances to dissipate his plus. 27. Bf2?! (27. Qc3! Rybka.) 27... Rae8 28. Qc3 Qxa4 29. Rxa5 Qc4 30. Qxc4 dxc4 31. Rc5 Rb8 32. Rxc4 Rxb2 33. Rxc6 Nd8 34. Rc7 And white is better, but winning it will be hard. } 27. Bf2 {Giving the bishop options and forcing black further back. } Nd8 28. Bh4 {A dubious move: The threat is simple enough, and it forced my opponent's resignation somewhat prematurely although I think he may just have wanted to finish a mini-tournament that had been going nearly 20 months.  28. Qd3 Ra8 (28... e5) 29. Qc3 Qb4 30. Qxb4 axb4 31. b3 Ra6 32. Rec1 With an obvious plus to white is simpler and clearer. } Nb7 {28... Qb4 29. Rd1 e5 30. Be1 Qb7 and white is doing well. } 29. Rc3 {This is a possible continuation had black played on.} Re8 {29... Qxd4  30. Bf2 Qf6 31. Rxc6 (31. Qe2 Raa8 32. Qxe6  Qxe6 33. Rxe6 Nd8 34. Re7) 31... Rxc6 32. Qxc6 Nd8 33. Qb6   29... e5 30. Rb3 Qxd4  31. Bf2 Qxa4 32. Qd3 Rf7 33. Rxb7 Rxb7 34. Qxa6 Rxb2   In both cases white is clearly better.} 30. Qd3 {30. Bg3 Qxd4  31. Bf2 Qf4 32. Rxc6 (32. Qd3 Raa8 33. Rxc6) 32... Rxc6 33. Qxc6 Re7 34. Re2 With nothing more than a slight plus for white. } Nd6 31. Bg3 Nf5 {With a plus for white, but nothing decisive. Black is passive, but his position is tough to crack. }
