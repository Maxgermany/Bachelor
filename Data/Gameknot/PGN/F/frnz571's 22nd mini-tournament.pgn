1. e4 {It starts off with the kings pawn Opening} Nc6 {Now My opponent comes out with his knight first which is fatal for my plan} 2. Nf3 {and i follow} e5 {then he brings out his kings pawn} 3. Nc3 {and my knight} Nf6 {then his knight so it basically starts off with a 4 knights opening} 4. Nxe5 {Now Here is where the Halloween's Gambit starts out by me sacrificing my knight to gain the middle} Nxe5 {Naturally he is gonna take it} 5. d4 {Then I push his knights back} Nc6 {And here there are other places he could have gone and this opening still works but this is the easiest } 6. d5 {so I kep chaseing the Knight away } Ne5 {Then he comes back to where my pawn was...} 7. f4 {and I push again } Ng6 {So then he moves to the other side I could keep chasing but it would not do me any good } 8. e5 {So here i chase the other knight and push him back to his original spot} Ng8 {OK at this point i have complete control of the middle of the board} 9. d6 {and so now i want to box him in so he will take with the pawn on C7} cxd6 {and then i will counter with my pawn} 10. exd6 {now he is boxed in now there are other moves that could be made but there are also other counters for the opening as well but this is what you usually end up with after the Halloween's gambit but since it worked out so well let me show you the rest of the game. Now look and my opponent has basically no position at all.} Qb6 {Here of course he brings his queen out to try and get rid of the pawn so i will counter once again} 11. Nb5 {so now i will protect my pawn} Kd8 {now he had to move his king cause he is basically boxed in and that messes up any chance of castling} 12. f5 {this time i attack the other knight} Ne5 {and he basically has no where to go he is just setting my pieces up for me} 13. Bf4 {and now i bring out the bishop which will also protect my pawn} a6 {so he attacks my night and i can safely move that} 14. Nc7 {and at this point he has to move his rook so he still cannot get that pawn} Rb8 {so now i get the knight back that i gave him and I'm way ahead at this point} 15. Bxe5 f6 16. Bc3 {at this point i should have just moved the bishop back but instead let him get the pawn at this point I'm going to move along a couple moves cause i made some mistakes along the way i new the game was won} Bxd6 17. Nd5 Qc6 18. Bc4 Qxc4 19. Nb6 Qe4+ 20. Qe2 Qxf5 21. Rf1 Qg5 22. Rd1 Bxh2 23. Rf3 Ne7 24. Bb4 Re8 {ok at this point I knew there was a mate here about 10 to 12 moves away i didn't see it right away but after thinking i got it here we go but i would have to give some pieces up but int he end I would get it} 25. Nxd7 Bxd7 26. Rxd7+ Kxd7 {OK here i dropped 2 pieces to him on purpose no less and here is where i get him } 27. Rd3+ {check} Kc6 {he could have moved the knight and ended me but he didnt} 28. Qe6+ {so i bring my queen down and check again} Kb5 {he has to move king} 29. a4+ {no here i give him another piece knowing that he is dead in the water} Kxb4 {then here took me a little thinking i new it was there but did not see it right away} 30. Qb6+ {check} Kc4 {he moves king the only place left to move} 31. b3# {and the pawn comes out to finish him off   Thanks and hope you liked it I'm not to good at this but any feed back on the opening or my annotation would be great..}
