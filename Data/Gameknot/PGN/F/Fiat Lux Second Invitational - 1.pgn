1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's Defense. } 3. d4 exd4 {Exchange variation.} 4. Qxd4 {Nxd4 is more common.  This is the Boden variation.} Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 {Still book, I believe.} 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Bg5 Be7 9. O-O-O h6 10. Bf4 O-O 11. Rhe1 Qd7 12. h3 b5 13. g4 a5 14. Nd5 Bxd5 15. exd5 Rfe8 16. g5 hxg5 17. Nxg5 Nh5 18. Reg1 Bf6 19. Qd3 g6 20. Ne6 Rxe6 21. dxe6 Qxe6 22. Qf3 {Queen threatens both Ra1 and Nh5.  Black protects the knight by picking off the h pawn.} Qxa2 {...or not.  Black is going to end up with six pawns against white's three, but a blunder throws white the game.} 23. Qxa8+ Kg7 24. Qf3 {The knight remains unprotected.  But black can push around the white king while molesting pawns.} Qxb2+ 25. Kd2 Qd4+ 26. Ke1 Nxf4 {Qb4 might have bought more time, but rook and bishop for queen isn't a terrible trade.  Rook and bishop for queen and knight however is not so hot.} 27. Rxd4 Bxd4 28. Qxf4 {28. Qxf4 Bc3+ buys black a move, but promoting the passed a pawn is probably not in the cards given white's queen and rook.}
