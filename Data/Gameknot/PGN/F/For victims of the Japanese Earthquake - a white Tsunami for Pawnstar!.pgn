1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Pawnstar bravely took a gamble with his play but alas it backfired on him big time and he just did not know what had hit him!  So, how did this happen.  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version of Steve's game with JJ: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16113275&rnd=0.39385938457218183.} Nf6 {2. ..... Nf6 - Steve responds to e4 with Nf6 which is the Alekhine's Defense.  This defense was a firm favourite of Freddy the Master Mater - it is good to see such a not so well known opening get a following.} 2. Nc3 {2. Nc3 - more usual is e5.} d5 3. Bd3 {3. Bd3?! - blocking in the d3 pawn - although it develops a piece it indirectly blocks in the other bishop.  I think d3 was better here.} d4 4. Nce2 e5 {4. ..... e5 - black keeps white bottled up.} 5. Nf3 Bd6 6. O-O Bg4 {6. ..... Bg4 - not a pin but the threat could be BxN weakening black's castled position.} 7. Ng3 h5 8. Nf5 h4 9. h3 Bxh3 {9. ...... Bxh3 - black decided to break up white's castled position this way because white's knight move to g3 allowed the knight on f3 to be pinned to but protected by his queen.   However, can this sac be justified?  White declines the sac and takes off the h pawn instead.} 10. Nf5xh4 Bg4 11. Be2 {11. Be2 - pin breaker.} Bxf3 12. Nxf3 {12. Nxf3 - the h file is open for black to attack white's castled position but can he take full advantage here?} Ng4 13. d3 {13. d3 - at last!} Kd7 {13. ..... Kd7?? - black wants to clear the 8th rank for his big guns to bang down that h column.  I would have thought Nc6 followed by 0-0-0 was more conventional however.  This move has a double question mark because it drops at least the exchange as you will see.} 14. Ng5 {14. Ng5! - counter-attack.  It is a nasty move for black to deal with as it discovers an attack on the g4 knight and threatens Nxf7 winning the exchange.} Rh6 {14. .... preparing for that line up but now it allows the loose knight on g4 to get pranged with check.} 15. Bxg4+ Kc6 {15. ..... Kc6 - the BK is further exposed.  Had it been my king, Henry, he would have been asking Glenda for his cloak!} 16. Nxf7 {16. Nxf7 - ouch and double ouch - here comes that dreaded fork and now black will be a whole rook down - horrible.} Qh4 {16. ...... Qh4 - white is in Old Matey's shadow but that is easily dealt with by that cadaverous white knight snapping off the hapless black rook on h6.} 17. Nxh6 gxh6 18. f4 Nd7 19. Bd2 {19. Bd2 - white completes his development.  If you look at the h column now you will notice that it will be very difficult for black to mount that counterplay down the h column because he has his own pawn there and he cannot take his own pawn.  Black is already lost.} Rg8 20. Be6 Rg3 21. Be1 {21. Be1 - skewer.} exf4 22. Bxg3 fxg3 {22. .... fxg3 - again white is in Old Matey's shadow.  Luckily for him his bishop can go to h3 to shut out the BQ.  Steve will have to find another way.} 23. Bh3 Nf6 24. Qf3 {24. Qf3 - now the WQ comes on f3 and the f6 knight is under the hammer.} Bf4 25. e5+ {25. e5+ - and so the carnage continues.  A discovered check wins the knight on f6.} Nd5 26. e6 {26. e6 - and now it looks as though another WQ is gonna appear on the board - Holy Smoke! } Be3+ 27. Kh1 Kd6 28. Qf8+ Ne7 29. Qd8+ Kc6 {29. .... Kc6 - and now a king hunt begins.} 30. Qd7+ Kb6 31. Rf7 Qg5 32. Rxe7 {32. Rxe7 - another black piece drops and so will the queenside pawns.  Not long now - the BK will soon be subjected to a lawnmower mate.} Bc1 33. Qxc7+ Ka6 34. Qxb7+ Ka5 35. Qxa7+ {35. Qxa7+ - after this move Steve resigns.  Not only does the BK have to face heavy white artillery from behind there is also that wall of white pawns.  I think that Steve overplayed his hand in this game with his attack and left too many loose pieces up for grabs.}
