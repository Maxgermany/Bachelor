1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 Bg7 4. d5 d6 5. Be2 Nf6 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O Nbd7 8. Bf4 {nothing out off the ordinary, in this Sicilian: but this move throws it into a totally different opening system; Ben Oni style...} a6 9. a4 Qb6 {after Qa5, Qd3...} 10. Ra3 h6 11. h3 g5 12. a5 Qc7 13. Bc1 Re8 14. Nd2 Ne5 15. Nc4 Nxc4 16. Bxc4 g4 17. hxg4 Nxg4 18. Be2 Ne5 19. Bd2 b5 20. axb6 e.p. Qxb6 21. Na4 Qc7 {I have to be very honest; Black is having trouble keeping things together; f4 is already very worrying...} 22. Rg3 Kh7 23. c4 Rg8 24. f4 {lucky for Black, overdue...} Nd7 25. Rff3 {after e5, dxe5, Bd3+, Kh8, Qh5, Nf6, White would have a serious attack...} Bd4+ 26. Kh1 {Be3 might have been better...} Nf6 27. Rxg8 Kxg8 28. f5 {hard to understand: a direct Rg3+ - or better Be3 - would have been more effective...} Nxe4 {why not?} 29. Bd3 {a bit late...} Ng5 {not trustworthy is Nxd2, Rg3+, Kf8, Qxd2, Bg7, Qf4; after Nf2+, Rxf2, Bxf2, Qg4+...} 30. Bxg5 {White is losing control: best is Rf4, Bf6, Rh4, Nf3, Rg4+, Ng5, Bxg5; now, Black is getting better...} hxg5 31. Nc3 {better Rg3...} Qb7 32. Rg3 {very careless: Qd2 was mandatory...} Qxb2 33. Rxg5+ Kf8 34. Qg4 {Ne4 was worth considering...} Bg7 {even stronger would have been Qa1+, Nd1, Bg7...} 35. Ne2 {the final flaw: Ne4 might have saved something...} a5 36. Nf4 {in vain...} Qc1+ 37. Kh2 Qxf4+ 38. Qxf4 Be5 {a close escape for Black...} 39. g3 {not good: better Kg3, a4, Rh5, a3, Bb1...} Bxf4 40. gxf4 a4 41. Rg2 a3 42. Ra2 Kg7 {settles the win...} 43. Kg3 {forced...} Kf6 44. Kg4 {dito, or else Bxf5...} Ra4 {Zugzwang: White has no moves left, so he resigned; the strongest continuation is Bb1 (trying to release Ra2), Rb4!, Bd3 (forced), Rb3, Be4 (Bc2, Rb2!), Ba6!, Rc2 (forced), Rb2, Rc1, a2, with again Zugzwang... Ra1/Kf3, Bxc4, Kf3/Ra1, Rb3+, Kf2, Ra3, and bring the fight to the White King...}
