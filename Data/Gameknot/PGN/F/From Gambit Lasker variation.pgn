1. f4 e5 2. fxe5 d6 3. exd6 Bxd6 {In blitz chess gambits are fun!  The threat is 4. ...,  Qh4+, 5. g6, Bxg6+, 6, hxg6, Qxg6++ } 4. Nf3 g5 {White defends against the threat and black threatens to play g4 chasing away the knight and renewing the threat. All book.} 5. g3 {I don't play this a lot ( Bird's opening is not too common ) but I am used to seeing 5. d4 which gives the king an out.  ( This might be OLD theory if there is better please comment. ) } g4 6. Nh4 Nf6 7. Bg2 {This looks like simple development but black has not given up on the dark squares yet.} Nh5 {Black has the tactical threat of 8. ..., Nxg6, 9.hxg6, Bxg6+, 10. Kf1, Bxh4 and black is now a pawn up with Qf6+ as a threat! } 8. O-O {This looks like a way to keep the king safe but now black can still stir things up.} Bxg3 9. hxg3 Nxg3 {Instead of starting the combination with the knight it starts with the bishop.  Black has two threats 10. ..., Nxf1 and 10. ...,Qxh4.} 10. Nf5 {Yes black should play 10. ..., Nxf5 but after 11. Rxf5, Bxf5, 12. Bxb7 I wasn't sure what would happen next.  But I thought I could get back to even and keep some attack with ... } Nxf1 11. Qxf1 Qg5 {I think white's best move here is 12. e4 protecting the knight and readying d3 or d4.   } 12. Ng3 h5 {The pawn storm looks tough.} 13. d3 {This is a mistake 13. d4 is better as it denies black a strong diagonal.} Qc5+ 14. Kh1 h4 15. Ne4 {Black can win the pawn on  c2 but the diagonal is more important than a pawn.  The threat of 16. ..., h3 looms large as well. } Qb6 16. Nf6+ {Wrong piece!  on 16. Qf6 I don't think there was anything black do but trade queens and allow the check.  But the pawns will still be dangerous.  ( 16. Qf6 threatens to capture the rook on h8 which is why the trade is forced. )  After 16. Qf6, Qxf6 17. Nxf6+, Kf8 white seems safe.} Kf8 17. Nc3 {I think 17. e3 closing off the diagonal would be better but hindsight is always better.} h3 18. Be4 g3 {19. ..., g2 is a big threat.} 19. Qf4 {This avoids the pawn fork but ...} g2+ {White must play 20. Bxg2 and after 20. ..., hxg2+, 21. Kxg2, try to work up his own attack on the black king.  ( Although after 21. ..., Bh3+, 22. Kf3, Qg1 there are some tactics for both sides. It looks too hard to follow in a blitz game for me. )  } 20. Kh2 {White resigned since 20. ..., g1=Q is mate. Thanks for taking time to read the game please help me with comments.}
