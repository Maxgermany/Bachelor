1. e4 c5 2. f4 d6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. c3 {my personal setup for the Grand Prix Attack (GPA)... I prefer this over the closed Sicilian with Nc3, such as 1. e4 c5, 2. Nc3 d6, 3. f4, for many reasons, mainly concerning Nc6; after Nf6, we now have d3... the main object here is g3, Bg2, 0-0, and develop...} e5 {Black has no better than an early d5, countered by e5, possibly followed by Bf5, Be2, e6, d3... this early outbreak gives White the advantage... } 5. fxe5 dxe5 6. Bc4 Bg4 7. O-O Nf6 8. d3 {stage 1 completed; Whites' sights are on f7...} Be7 {better first a6, a4, Qc7, to avoid upcoming complications...} 9. h3 Bd7 {better than Bxf3, Qxf3, 0-0, g4/Qg3!, and the GPA is rolling...} 10. Be3 {always an important move, in this variation; it counters mainly Qb6, followed by c4 and check... after Qb6, Qc2, supporting e4, and eventually d4...} O-O 11. Nbd2 Qc7 12. Qe1 Na5 {a very bad moment to try and neutralize Bc4; Black had best in Qd6, Nb3, b6, Nh4, a5...} 13. Qg3 b5 {better Nc6...} 14. Bd5 Nxd5 {whatever the solution may be, this is not it; better try Bc6, c4, bxc4, dxc4, Rb8, or Nc6, Nb3, c4, etcetera... c5 has to be utilized at some time...} 15. Bh6 {a nasty surprise...} Bf6 {not better is g6, exd5, Rfe8, Qxe5, Qxe5, Nxe5, Bf5, g4...} 16. exd5 Bf5 17. Nh4 Bg6 {all forced, Black is running into trouble soon...} 18. Rxf6 {the point of this small combination; White is winning at least some material, especially after Raf1...} gxh6 {even worse for Black is gxf6, Nf5!, Qd8, Ne4!, followed by Bg7...} 19. Nf5 {Black is in big trouble; the rogue pawn d5 is the desperado killer here... best option is running from checks with Kh8, and sit things out...} Nb7 {there it is: Black is losing a piece...} 20. d6 {simple, but lethal: considering the threat Ne7+, followed by Qxe5, Black has to play Nxd6, Nxd6, Rad8, N2e4, c4, losing the Q's Knight...} Qd7 {or Qd8; this loses swiftly...} 21. Ne7+ {after Kg7 or Kh8, follows Qxe5 and soon mate... best is to get it over with by Qxe7, dxe7, and pray for a quick and not too painful kill...} Kh8 22. Qxe5 Nxd6 {the easy way out...} 23. Rxf7# {}
