1. e4 {Currently this is my standard white opening} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nd4 4. Nxe5 Qg5 {I had never seen this opening before and was surprised at how much potential it has if white makes another mistake.} 5. Bxf7+ Ke7 6. O-O {This may look like a large mistake, but it beats the alternative of checkmate or loss of close to my entire back rank.} Qxe5 7. Bc4 {If the queen captures the pawn, I pin it to the king with Rf1} Kd8 {Moves his king to what seems like a safe spot.} 8. Nc3 {Protecting the pawn} Bb4 9. Bd3 {securing the pawn  so that capture of knight isn't as damaging } Bxc3 10. dxc3 {opens up black bishop} Nc6 11. Qf3 {threating checkmate on f8} Qf6 {This is blacks blunder. All I have to do now is make his queen move and I will have mate.} 12. Bg5 {A decisive move that removes black from the game. Black cannot take the bishop because of the checkmate and can not move the queen because of the pin of his king. } Ne5 {attacks my queen, but...} 13. Bxf6+ {when I take his, it is check} Nxf6 14. Qg3 {threatening Qxg7} Nxd3 15. Qxg7 {Forking both the rook and knight with no way to save the knight. All moves result in loss of more material, so black makes the right decision and resigns.}
