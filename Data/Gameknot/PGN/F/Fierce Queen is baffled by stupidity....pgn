1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {the French opening: always hated that; I have tried e4-e5, with switching luck: nowadays, I just accept the gambit...} 3. exd5 exd5 4. Nc3 c6 5. Nf3 h6 6. Be2 Nf6 7. O-O Bd6 8. Ne5 {throwing in an early disturbance...} Nbd7 {looks like winning an easy pawn for Black: but White has some suprises in store...} 9. Bh5 {complicating matters: Blacks' King is suddenly very unsafe...} Nxe5 10. dxe5 Bxe5 11. Re1 {of course...} Qd6 12. f4 Qc5+ 13. Be3 d4 {probably the losing move...} 14. fxe5 Nxh5 15.
