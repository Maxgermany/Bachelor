1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {never understood this move: this is a remnant from the so called 'Fischer-move' in some old variation of the Sicilian...} g6 3. a3 Bg7 4. Ne2 e6 5. f4 Ne7 6. O-O O-O 7. d3 d5 8. Ba2 b5 {why not? in this stage, anything goes in the Sicilian...} 9. Qe1 a5 {just what the Sicilian is all about: conquering the Queens' wing by brute force...} 10. f5 exf5 11. exf5 Nxf5 12. Nbc3 {looking for trouble...} b4 13. Nxd5 Bb7 14. Ndf4 bxa3 {introducing new trouble, on the Queens' wing: pawn b2 is pinned...} 15. Rb1 Qb6 16. bxa3 Qc6 {threatening mate on g2: out of the blue...} 17. Bd5 {the only move...} Qxd5 {they do not call me fiercequeen for nothing: I am never afraid of saccing my Queen...} 18. Nxd5 Bxd5 19. Nf4 Ba2 20. Rb7 Nc6 {completing development: White is way behind...} 21. Nd5 Bxd5 22. Rd7 Rae8 {maybe better Rfe8? you tell me...} 23. Qd1 Be6 24. Rc7 Ncd4 {the light cavalry, comes in...} 25. Rxc5 Rec8 26. Rxa5 {greed, before the fall...} Rxc2 27. Bf4 Rfc8 {Black is not mocking around: virtually a mere pawn behind, all pieces are in full attack mode...} 28. Qb1 Ne2+ 29. Kh1 Nfd4 {Black has conquered the board...} 30. Qb7 Nxf4 {after Rxf4??, Rc1+, soon followed by mate...} 31. Ra8 Rxa8 32. Qxa8+ Bf8 33. Qe4 Nde2 {closing the deal...} 34. d4 Bd5 {the final chord, and the winning move...} 35.
