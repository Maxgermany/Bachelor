1. d4 {N.B. I know, I should have played Black in this game, but I would rather not replay the game - I will compensate by playing Black in the next two games, how about that...} d5 2. c4 c6 {Fritz chooses the Slav Defence. I have little experience of this opening, but I think I can wing it somehow...} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4 {I think this transposes into Queen's Gambit Accepted territory. Much more comfortable for me.} 5. e4 b5 6. a4 {The classic move to undermine Black's queenside pawn structure in the QGA.} b4 {Bypassing my a-pawn, Fritz is squashing my queenside with his b- and c-pawns.} 7. e5 {I realised that this loses me a pawn. But it was the best way to keep my queenside open.} bxc3 8. exf6 cxb2 9. Bxb2 exf6 10. Bxc4 Bb4+ 11. Nd2 Qe7+ 12. Qe2 {Fritz demonstrates his tactical skill. He likes to have all my pieces nicely pinned to my king.} Be6 13. Bxe6 Qxe6 14. Qxe6+ fxe6 15. Rd1 Nd7 16. O-O {This loses me the a-pawn. I realised that just after having made the move. But then, I can create counterplay by attacking the e-pawn...} Nb6 17. Rfe1 Nxa4 18. Rxe6+ Kd7 {Oh dear. I've blundered. Now I will lose either the rook or the bishop...for nothing.} 19. Rde1 Nxb2 20. Re6e7+ {Another blunder...don't ask...} Bxe7 {And I resigned. Behind by a rook, a bishop and a passed pawn - how could this position get any worse!?  Anyway, after my shocking performance against Unleashed Fritz 10, at least I retain a slim lead over the Computers - the scores as they stand are 2.5 to fatcat2, 1.5 to the Computers.  I have learned from my mistakes. Never again will I muck up in this horrific way, against a computer or a human. And never again will I pile the brandy cream so high on the Christmas pudding...}
