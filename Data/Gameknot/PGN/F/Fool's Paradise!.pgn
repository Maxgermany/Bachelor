1. e4 {The other day, I couldn't resist having a peak through my buddy, The Dentist's past games profile because his rating had suddenly shot up about 18 points.  I saw this brevity and I couldn't help playing through it to see how The Dentist managed to pulverise his opponent in just TWELVE MOVES!  I saw how, he showed his opponent the utter folly of leaving the Fool's Mate diagonal unprotected.  Yes, white was certainly awakened from a Fool's Paradise.} Nc6 2. f4 e5 {2......... e5 - transposes into a sort of King's Gambit declined.} 3. f5 {3. f5? - bad move - this leaves the Fool's Mate diagonal unprotected to the BQ.  Better was Nf3 guarding the h4 square and developing a piece at the same time - in this case white will now drop a pawn as 3........ Qh4  forks WK and e4 pawn.} Qh4+ 4. g3 Qxe4+ {4. ........ Qxe4  - after 4. g3?? this allows another queen fork on e4 and the WR on h1 is toast.  The Dentist may have a low rating, but as you saw with my earlier annotated game "In the Dentist's Chair" in which I very nearly lost he is not to be underestimated!  Now white really feels the drill as a lot of enammel is about to disappear from his side of the board!!} 5. Qe2 Qxh1 6. Nf3 {6. Nf3 - develops a piece but three moves too late.  The Dentist now develops very sensibly bringing out a knight to f6.} Nf6 7. Qc4 {7. Qc4?? - white tries to counter-attack by zeroing in on f7 with his queen but he leaves the f3 knight en prise.} Qxf3 8. Be2 {8. Be2 - develops a piece but white is way down on material.  Had it been me I would have resigned when I knew I was going to drop a rook even though The Dentist is 300 points south of my rating.  But I don't think I would have left the Fool's Mate diagonal unprotected in the first place.} Qh1+ 9. Kf2 {9. Kf2 - would interposing with 9. Bf1 been any better?  Now the WK is driven into open country.} Qxh2+ {9. ........... Qxh2 , yet still more ennamel is drilled away!!} 10. Kf3 e4+ {10. ....... e4  - deadly pawn stab!} 11. Ke3 Qxg3+ 12. Bf3 {12. Bf3 - white throws in the sponge after playing this move because he knows that when the Dentist next comes on line, white is going to cop Old Matey on f3!}
