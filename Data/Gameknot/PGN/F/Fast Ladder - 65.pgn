1. e4 {The Fast Ladder seems to invite an up and at 'em attitude, so it's 1. e4 for me once more.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Spanish Torture.  Is this wise given my current difficulty in the mini-tournament of that name (P9 W4 L5) (and the other games aren't going too well..)?} a6 4. Bxc6 {I don't often play the Exchange but it makes a change to give it an outing now and then.  When Andrew Martin did a simul at Reading a few years ago, I bought his book on it, though I didn't consult it in this game.} dxc6 {The correct way to recapture.  White can't yet win the e-pawn because Black has a strong counter.  I can't remember what it is, I just know that I mustn't take the pawn yet.} 5. O-O f6 6. Qe2 {This prepares Rd1 followed by the advance of the d-pawn.  I think this is more dangerous than an immediate d4.} Bd6 7. Rd1 Bg4 8. h3 Bh5 9. g4 Bf7 10. c3 Ne7 11. d4 exd4 12. cxd4 O-O 13. Nc3 Ng6 14. Be3 Nf4 15. Qd2 Nxh3+ {This proves double-edged as it opens up an line of attack for White} 16. Kg2 Ng5 17. Nxg5 {White takes the opportunity to swap off the well placed knight.} fxg5 18. Bxg5 {and attack the Black Queen} Qd7 {which spots the loose g-pawn} 19. f3 {Now White's pawn structure looks a bit more solid.} Bg6 {Black immediately exposes an attack on f3 and creates a threat against e4 and therefore g4.  The threats aren't immediately effective but could soon become so.} 20. e5 {White uses his attacked pawns to counter-attack.  This protected passed pawn is a monster!} Bb4 21. a3 Ba5 22. b4 {For the second time, White launches a wing attack, chasing away an unsupported, intrusive bishop.} Bb6 {Now White improves his knight with tempo by threatening to swap it for Black's Bishop.} 23. Na4 Ba7 24. Nc5 Qd5 {Black in turn improves the position of his Queen and makes the threat to f3 a real one.} 25. Rdf1 Bxc5 {Finally Black swaps off the Bishop for the Knight.} 26. bxc5 Rae8 {Threatening to take the e-pawn because its defender is pinned against White's Queen.} 27. Rad1 {Defending the Queen so that the e-pawn is now defended.} h6 28. Be3 {It was tempting to take on h6 and follow up with Qxh6 but I couldn't find a convincing path to victory that way yet.} Re7 {Preparing to double, presumably on the f-file.} 29. Kg3 {Preparing to advance the f-pawn as well.} Bh7 {Preparing ...g5} 30. f4 b5 {Black seeks to sort out his Queenside pawns and create a threat of queening, thus distractign White from the developing Kingside attack.} 31. f5 {White is not distracted.} h5 32. Bg5 Ree8 {If the Rook had stayed on the second rank it would have been attacked by the e-pawn, with nowhere to go.} 33. Qe2 {Both supporting an advance by the e-pawn and attacking the h-pawn} a5 34. f6 g6 35. gxh5 gxh5 36. Qxh5 b4 37. axb4 axb4 38. Rfh1 {Finally White exploits the open h-file, threatening mate.} Rf7 39. Bh6 {to cut off the rook's defence of h7 by 40. Bg7.} b3 40. Qg5+ Kh8 41. Bg7+ Kg8 42. Rxh7 {forcing mate.  Black resigned.}
