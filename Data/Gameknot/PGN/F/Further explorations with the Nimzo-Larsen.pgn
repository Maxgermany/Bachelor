[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), modern variation"]

1. b3 {When I started to play this game I was mired in a dismal losing streak mostly of my own making. At times not paying proper attention in the opening, at other times losing my focus while transversing the labyrinths of the middle game. Chess demands that you stay alert and play with purpose or the gods of cassia will pick you up by the scruff of your neck and will shake all the confidence and hubris out of you. Again I open with the Nimzo-Larsen Attack. An opening I am currently learning in my quest to build an opening repertoire. I tend to annotate more from of a strategical and psychological point of view rarther than use variations. I also of course annotate from my point of view. I'm sure that my opponent would have his own side of things.} e5 {The Standard reply.} 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 d5 {Black sets up his center while I intend to attack it from the flanks. Classic hypermodern strategy on the part of White.} 4. Bb5 Bd7 5. Bxc6 Bxc6 6. Bxe5 {My opponent was not paying attention. I'm getting more familair with this opening and I get to capture one of his center pawns for nothing. This can't be a bad thing.} f6 7. Bb2 Bd6 8. Nf3 {Development continues and already I'm getting somewhat nervous. Black's bishops are positioned menacingly at my king side. } a6 9. Na3 {Although this knight move looks awkward, I have often seen it when replaying master games involving the Nimzo-Larsen with white. The bishop's influence remains unencumbered upon the center.} Ne7 10. c4 {Standard procedure on the part of white in this opening. Attack black's center from the flank. } Qd7 11. Qc2 b6 12. Nd4 {I decide to aggressively move my king's knight to d4 and attack my opponent's white bishop. This knight will play a major role in the course of this game and will forever be close to my heart.} Bb7 13. cxd5 {I take out his remaining center pawn.} Bxd5 14. Nc4 {A bad mistake and I took two days to make this move. And I noticed my mistake just after I made my move, funny how often that happens to me. Now black can play B*g2 forcing me to move my rook, then he can play Q-h3 with a strong attack. I should have played e4, driving his bishop back and then played N-c4. I can get so wrapped up in a certain variation that I don't look at other possibilities. In short I can become so fixated on one variation that it produces an inhibiting effect on all my other thoughts. This happens in my life as well. I'm thinking at the time, 'oh no, I've done it again'. I was already in a bad losing streak and saw it continueing with this move.} b5 {I sweated it out for two days as my opponent takes awhile to make his moves. But remarkably he didn't see it and played b5 instead. I had been given a reprieve} 15. Nxd6+ {i eagerly take out one of his bishops while putting his king in check, now he has to take my knight.} Qxd6 16. e4 {I play the move i should have made at my 14th move. Now his bishop has to retreat.} Bb7 17. d3 {Giving my e4 pawn some needed support.} O-O 18. Rc1 Rac8 19. Nf3 { I move my knight back as I could see black could attack it with c5. I also thought it would be wise to protect my kingside a little more with this move as I intended to castle soon.} c5 {Black is grabbing space on the queen side but at a price. I'm already thinking that someday my knight might be able to infiltrate black's position on the queen side. In chess and especially with pawn moves, when you gain something you often give something else up.} 20. O-O Rfd8 21. Rfd1 {We are firmly ensconced in the middlegame with our rooks developed and connected. } Ng6 22. Ba3 {I move my bishop to entice his b5 pawn to move up leaving a hole at c4.} b4 23. Qc4+ {I put his king in check with my queen.} Kh8 24. Bb2 {My bishop goes back. Black has more space on the queen side but may be opening himself up to an attack on the flank of his pawn structure on that side of the board. In the Nimzo-Larsen, White will often hold his center pawns back. They can be used later in the middlegame to move up the center of the board at opportune times.} Nf4 {Oh I don't like this. While I have been wrapping myself up in queen side issues, I forgot that my opponent has plans of his own. His knight has infiltrated my king side on f4 threatening my camp at d3 and e2. And there was a reason i listed d3 first because I didn't see the threat to e2 at the time. Again getting so caught up in a particular thought and acting on it too soon.} 25. Ne1 {My knight defends d3 and...} Ne2+ {His knight forks my king and rook.} 26. Kh1 Nxc1 27. Bxc1 {Okay i lost my rook but materialwise we are still pretty even as I capture his damn knight and I was already up that pawn from the opening.} h6 28. Nf3 {I have been reading a lot lately about piece activity as it realtes to your pawn structure. I want to get my knight more involved in things as I see a future for him on black's queen side.} a5 29. Qf7 {I move my queen to attack black's bishop expecting him to defend it with one of his rooks.} Rc7 30. Qc4 {Naturally I retreat my queen. Black's queen and rook on now both on the same diagonal. I'm wondering if I can attack them with my bishop who although mobile is not doing too much at the moment.} Ba6 {He attacks my queen.} 31. Qc2 Qc6 {I'm beginning to feel constrained on the queenside. Black's pawns are giving him a lot of space and providing his pieces with mobility on that side of the board. I want to play d4, challenging him in the center while giving my own pieces a little more breathing room. What I'm worried about is giving his bishop more scope with that move. I decide the trade off is worth it.} 32. d4 {I make the move...d4 and feel later back upon looking at this move that it turns the game in my favour.} c4 {My opponent continues to push his pawns on the queenside. But with his last move he has given me a passed pawn on d4 and it has a rook behind it.} 33. Bf4 {I want to get my bishop more involved in things so I attack black's rook on c7.} Rcc8 34. d5 {I now push my passed pawn attacking my opponent's queen. I'm beginning to make him make forced moves and it is empowering for me. The position on the board has changed some in just the last few moves.} Qe8 35. Nd4 {My knight leaps into the fray at d4 with his eye on c6 and e6. He will prove to pay a pivotal role in this game and will be black's nemesis.} c3 {Black pushes another pawn giving him a passed pawn on c3. My queen will have to stay where she is to make sure that this scoundrel doesn't move further up the board.} 36. Nc6 {I counter by playing my knight to c6. He is now firmly ensconced in Black's camp and will be a thorn in his side. He is also attacking a rook and a very important pawn at a5 (the base of black's pawn chain on the queenside).} Rd7 37. Nxa5 {My knight captures the pawn weakening black's queenside pawn structure. Now my target is the pawn at b4 which supports the passed pawn on c3.} Rc5 {He attacks my knight.} 38. Nc6 {And back the knight goes to c6, striking out at various squares. My center pawns are playing a significant role supporting my knight and dominating the center of the board. Black does not have any center pawns of his own to contest the center of the board. } Rb7 {I seldom comment on my opponenets moves but i think it would be wiser for him to attack my e4 pawn. I'm not sure what this rook move accomplishes.} 39. Be3 {Again I force him into making a move as my bishop attacks his rook. I feel I have taken charge of this game and I feel it stems back to my 32nd move when I pushed my pawn to d4.} Rcb5 40. f3 {I give my pawns in the center of the board which are the key to my position solid support. I feel my position is getting stronger as the game progresses. i also feel I am setting the agenda and am in charge and focused whereas my opponent has seemed to have lost the thread of his game.} Rd7 {Black again shifts his rook back to d7. I can almost feel his indecision.} 41. Qf2 {I swing my queen behind my bishop. I want play my bishop to c5 attacking the base of black's pawn setup on the queenside and it will need to be protected.} Bb7 {Have to be careful here. Black attacks my knight. If I leave it on c6, he will capture it and I will be forced to recapture with my d5 pawn, then his rook will swoop down capturing my rook and putting me in check. The only way to stop him would be interposing with my queen and losing her in the ensuing exchange.} 42. Nd4 {I retreat the knight to d4 while again attacking his rook on b5. How he must hate that knight.} Ra5 43. Ne6 {The knight moves yet again, this time onto square e6. His unsettling influence on black is enabling me to pursue my own plans while black seems forever to be making forced moves to protect himself. 'The initiative' in chess is a key concept and when it is in your possession chess can be quite fun and empowering.} Qc8 {My opponent moves his queen to backup his passed pawn on c3.} 44. Bc5 {I plug that file up with my bishop who is supported by, you guessed it,my knight on e6. The other reason for moving my bishop to c5 was to attack the pawn supporting black's passed pawn. Having your pieces work in concert with each other is something I'm only now realizing. Piece activity in conjunction with your pawn structure.} Rb5 {His rook moves to protect his pawn at b4.} 45. Rd4 {I attack the pawn again with my rook lift to d4.} Ba6 {Black moves his bishop off the blocked diagonal. His pieces seem to be in each other's way. I have played the Nimzo-Larsen a few times now and I find the concept of holding your center pawns back in the opening and later advancing them in the middlegame to be a very effective technique. Again remember back to the position I had before my 32nd move when I advanced my pawn to d4. It changed the direction and contour of the game.} 46. Qc2 {Now that the bishop is protected by my knight I shift my queen back to c2 due to the following sequence....46...r*b4, r*b4...47...b*b4, c2...My queen will be needed to blockade black's pawn at c3 after the fireworks of the exchange on b4.} Rxc5 {Black draws first blood by capturing my bishop. I thought for awhile before i responded. I wanted to keep my knight on e6 where I thought i would have further use of him. Plus I had grown quite fond of him.} 47. Rxb4 {My rook takes out the remaining pawn support for the pawn at c3.} Ra5 48. a4 {I plug up the a file restricting black's rooks mobility.} Bb7 {My opponent now shifts his attack to my passed pawn on d5 but it is solidly defended by my center pawn on e4.} 49. Rc4 {I attack his queen while stepping my attack on his last remaining (passed) pawn on the queenside.} Qb8 50. Qxc3 {My queen finishes off his pawn. I now have the c file firmly in hand with potential entry points on c6 and c7 thanks to my passed pawn and my beloved knight at e6.} Ra8 51. Rc7 {I thrust my rook into the heart of his queenside which is ably backed up my queen and knight. Notice how much havoc my knight has caused my opponent. If you can park your knight deep into your oppponent's territory your game can almost play itself. I think Steinitz said that.} Rxc7 {He takes my rook.} 52. Nxc7 {And my by now hated knight gobbles up his rook while attacking his other rook. He will have to move it.} Ra7 53. d6 {My passed pawn moves up to d6 giving further support to my knight. This dynamic duo has spearheaded my offensive into black's territory.} Bc8 54. h3 {Now that I have black tied up I decide to provide my King with an escape square as it might be needed later on. Don't want black's queen or rook swooping down cheating me out of all my hard work. I have lost many games while not paying enough attention to the safety of my king.} Rb7 {He attacks my backward pawn on b3.} 55. Nb5 {And of course my knight (who else) plugs up the file while providing protection for my passed pawn at d6. This knight is going to go into my 'Chess hall of Fame" as the only member. Hopefully I can make further addiitons later on in my chess career.} Bd7 {Black attacks the hated knight.} 56. Qc4 {I move my queen up to give it a little more scope.} Bxb5 {A sad day...My knight which had given me what seemed like unending service goes down on his shield to Black's scoundrel bishop...My White King wipes a tear from his eye in his bunker at h1 while the Largo movement of Vivaldi's Trumpet Concerto in B Flat Minor plays in the background.} 57. axb5 {My rook's pawn hacks down the scondrel bishop and cuts off his head and shakes it at the Black King huddling in the corner. } Qxd6 {Black's queen takes my passed pawn. Sad to see such  loyal and hard working servants fall by the way side but chess is not just a game, it's a war and pieces have to lay down for the greater good.} 58. Qc8+ {My queen swoops down and puts the despised Black king in check while attacking his rook as well.} Kh7 59. Qxb7 {The rook falls and newly created passed pawns are born out of the carnage. The die is cast for Black. I'm no endgame player but in a position like this I don't have to be.} Qd1+ {His queen checks my king while attacking my pawn at b3. } 60. Kh2 Qxb3 {He takes my pawn.} 61. Qc6 {I can't see how he is going to stop me from queening this pawn but I know he is going to try.} Qe3 62. b6 {I push my pawn onward to glory and a game that will be dedicated to my king's knight whose efforts have made it all possible.} Qf4+ 63. Kh1 Qe5 64. b7 {And the rest of it is just a matter of a lack of technique on my part but it was enough to win...or did I win?...The more I play this game of Chess the more I realize that I'm really playing against myself. Struggling against the things that hold me back, against the shadows buried deep in my pysche. My opponent offers me a mirror to view the things I struggle against...in that regard he is more of a comrade than anything else.} Qa1+ 65. Kh2 Qe5+ 66. Kg1 Qa1+ 67. Kf2 Qb2+ 68. Kg3 Qe5+ 69. f4 Qb2 70. Qc7 Qb4 71. b8=Q {Fritz of course showed numerous mistakes on both sides but I have come to realize that when I go over a game I'm more interested in the 'story' of it rather than the clinical dissection of it. Chess like life is full of mistakes and drama..... and it was meant to be played by people not to be analyzed by a cold calculating machine that will never know what it is like to feel doubt and to be unsure of yourself. Chess is a metaphor for life with all it's accompanying problems and win or lose there will always be another game and probably another life as well....the way I see it anyway...}
