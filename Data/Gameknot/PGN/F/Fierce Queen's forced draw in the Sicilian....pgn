[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 Bg7 {what I usually play: the Hungarian variation, with no fear for dxc5, Qa5+, followed by Qxc5, threatening Qb6 and attack b2...} 4. c4 {not uncommon: White switches to Symmetrical English style of play...} cxd4 {no use in holding on to e6 and Ne7, to prepare d5: we need to break up the center...} 5. Nxd4 Nf6 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Be2 d6 8. O-O Nbd7 {the last option for Black to create fighting chances: after Nc6, all is equalized...} 9. Be3 {or f3, h6, Be3...} Nc5 10. f3 Re8 11. Qc2 {at least completing development: better was Rc1, a6...} Bd7 12. Rfd1 a5 13. b3 Qb6 14. Qd2 Rec8 15. Rab1 Qd8 {both players are relocating their pieces: White has a very tiny edge after a3 or a4...} 16. Bg5 Ra6 17. Ndb5 Qf8 18. Be3 {in a sense, settling for a draw: after a4, Qd8, Be3, things would have been different...} Raa8 19. Bg5 Ne6 {or Ra6...} 20. Be3 Nc5 21. Rde1 Qd8 22. Rbc1 {a4, might have done something...} Qe8 23. Bd4 Qd8 {Ne6, Bb6, is not good for Black...} 24. Be3 Qe8 25. Bd4 Qd8 26. Be3 {draw by threefold repetition...}
