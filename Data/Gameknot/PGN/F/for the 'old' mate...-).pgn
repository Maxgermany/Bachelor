1. e4 {I'm using this more to help myself think out my moves than as an educational tool.  Feel free to read if you like...you may gain some insight in how another player plays  Want Danish gambit} c5 2. Bc4 {I have no idea how to attack this opening, so I'll develop my pieces...} d6 3. Nf3 e6 {Would push to d4, but his Queen could attack, so I'll castle} 4. O-O a6 5. d4 {d4 to open the board a bit.} cxd4 {Queen or knight, I'll use knight so he doesn't chase my Queen around. Both of his bishops are cuyrrently blocked.} 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. b3 {open b2 for bishop} Nf6 8. Nd2 {protect e4, but leave the lane open for the bishop.  He has no attacks.} O-O 9. Bb2 {move bishop to control diagonal} e5 10. Nd4f3 {Back up, no good attacks} Qc7 11. h3 {Prevent knight or bishop from approaching} b5 {Back up or move to d5 and attack rook.  He'll just trade with the knight, so I'll back up.} 12. Bd3 Bb7 13. Qe2 {stall move} Nc6 {c4??  if he takes, I'll advance position.  If he pushes, his pawn position improves and i"m blocked in.  c3 blocks his knight from advancing but blocks my diagonal, which is blocked anyway.    No real attcks or risks seen.} 14. c3 Nh5 {he opened a path for the bishop and had potential at Kf4.    g3 to block knight?  leaves h3 out to dry...    Back off knight and attack knight with Queen?  b4 to block his pawn movement?} 15. g3 Qb6 {Nice move, he's pinned f2 and fored me to advance the king, wasting a move.    Could move queen up, but if he trades, Kxg3.  He is still unable to devolop anything else quickly.  Kg2 makes the pawn at e4 very important, but Kh2 take away a protector from f2....  I can guard e4 pretty well.} 16. Kg2 Nd8 {And the attck on e4 begins, unless he is diverting my attention.  } 17. Qe3 Qxe3 18. fxe3 Ne6 {c4 to hopefully trade pawns and advance the bishop to d5} 19. c4 b4 {He saw through the trade.    c5 would make him take away the protection from e5which would open an attack on f7  I t will also allow the bishop to attack the knight at e6.} 20. c5 Nxc5 21. Bc4 {Well, I pushed the wrong button and made my problem worse.  He did not use his pawn to take mine and now has a good attack on e4.  } Nf6 {I think he may have lost tempo with this.  I can ng5 to attack and defend and possibly back the King away.} 22. Ng5 h6 23. Nxf7 Rxf7 24. Bxf7+ Kxf7 {Back to the drawing board.    He'll get e4, but I have the knight pinned.  Maybe I can get to it.} 25. h4 Nd3 26. Rab1 Rc8 27. g4 Rc2 {It's all reacting form here on out....} 28. Bc1 Nxc1 29. Rbxc1 Rxd2+ 30. Kg3 Ke6 31. Rf2 Nxe4+ {}
