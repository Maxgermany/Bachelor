1. f4 {In this game, I play black and open with a combination of moves that my Dad calls a "Bobby Fisher" opening (which is also called "Reti" when it is played for white, and can be the Old Indian in some variants).  It makes for a closed game.  I'm still experimenting with this opening for black and learning things as I go, and I'd truly enjoy your comments on the strengths and weaknesses of this opening for black.} Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 {As is fairly typical, this closed opening cedes the center pawns to white.} d6 4. h3 Bg7 5. Qf3 {White doesn't advance the d pawn, which allows me to advance the c pawn.} c5 6. Bc4 O-O 7. b3 Nc6 8. Nge2 {Completed the fist 8 moves of this opening.  At this point, there are options to attack the middle or either side, particularly the queenside.} a6 9. Bb2 b5 10. Bd3 {I was expecting 10. Bd3, and thought I'd move e5, ... 10. Bd3 e5 11. fxe5 Nxe5} b4 {... but I changed my mind and moved b4 first, thus pressuring the knight.} 11. Nd5 e5 {... then moved to e5.  At this point, I would have expected f5 or fxe5 ...} 12. O-O-O {... but white long castled? ...} exf4 {... thus allowing me to go back on the offensive setting up what would be the beginning of the end at move 17.} 13. Nexf4 Ne5 14. Nxf6+ Bxf6 15. Qg3 Nxd3+ 16. Qxd3 Bxb2+ 17. Kxb2 Qf6+ {A good old fashioned Queen fork.} 18. c3 Qxf4 19. Rdf1 Qe5 20. g4 bxc3+ 21. dxc3 {21. dxc3 a5 22. a4 Ba6 (23. .. Bxf1 24. Rxf1) } a5 {The chess gods were smiling on me ... I saw the potential for a stacked Queen and rook along the diagonal ...} 22. a4 Ba6 {... and he didn't see it coming.} 23. Qd5 Qxd5 24. exd5 {I expected this to happen ... 24. exd5 Bxf1 25. Rxf1 Rf-e8 26. Rf6 Ra-d8 } Bxf1 {The rest of the game was spent making sure I didn't do anything stupid.} 25. Rxf1 f5 {... but changed my mind and advanced the f pawn with the support of the rook.} 26. g5 f4 27. Kc2 Rf5 28. Kd2 Rxd5+ 29. Kc2 Rf8 30. Rf3 Rff5 31. h4 Kf7 32. c4 Rd4 33. Kc3 Re5 34. Rf2 Re3+ 35. Kc2 f3 36. Rd2 {Although I expected this ... 36. Rh2 Re2  37. Rxe2 fxe2 (King can't block) ... he decided to trade rooks. } Rxd2+ 37. Kxd2 Re2+ 38. Kd1 Ke6 39. b4 {Just some closing notes here on out ... 39. b4 cxb4 39. Kc1 f2 39. h5 gxh5 } cxb4 40. c5 dxc5 41. h5 {41. Kc1 f2 41. h5 gxh5 } gxh5 42. g6 hxg6 {}
