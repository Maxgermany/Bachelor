1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 g6 3. Nc3 d6 {after Nf3, always Bg7: after Nc3 always d6; do not ask why...} 4. f4 Bg7 {White is transposing to the GPA...} 5. f5 a5 6. b4 b5 {also axb4 was possible here: but Black has to be careful; there are a lot of tensions here...} 7. a3 Bd7 {of course Nc3 cannot intervene: it is pinned over Ra1...} 8. Nf3 {already, White is losing it...} bxc4 9. d3 Nc6 10. Bb2 axb4 11. axb4 Rxa1 {Nxb4 will also work: this is more forcing...} 12. Bxa1 Nxb4 13. Bb2 cxd3 14. cxd3 Qa5 {time to bring in the heavy artillery...} 15. Ba3 Ba4 {after Nxa4, Nxd3+ does the trick...} 16. Qc1 {not paying attention: Na2 is already lethal...} Nxd3+ {no rocket science involved here...} 17. Kd2 Nxc1 18. Kxc1 {making matters worse: Rxc1 would have made a difference...} Qxc3+ 19. Kb1 Qxa3 20. Rc1 Qb2# {thanks to Bg7...}
