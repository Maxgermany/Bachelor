[Opening "King's Indian (E60), 3.g3, counterthrust variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. Nc3 {So far a  King's Indian Defence, Fianchetto Variation, with a slightly unusual move order. } Bg4 {(!?) More usual here is to move the c-pawn one or two squares, or to move the b8-N (to c6 or d7).} 7. O-O Qc8 {Anchors the g4-B on its advanced square.  White can not chase it off by h3 (supposing he would want to).  Black might consider ...Bh3 to exchange the light square bishops (LSBs).} 8. Re1 {Quite a well known device against Black's threat to force the bishop exchange by ...Bh3.  The rook move obviates the half-pin, so that if 8...Bh3 9.Bh1! and Black can never dig the bishop off the long diagonal.} Re8 9. Qb3 {Further bolstering d5, with some incidental pressure on b7 and maybe f7 as well.  However, it seems that 9.d5; 9.Bg5; 9.b3 or 9.e4 are more often played.} Nc6 10. d5 Na5 {"The knight on the rim is dim".  Well, not always.  The WQ doesn't have a wide range of options if the c-pawn is to be preserved, and one suspects that Black already has something in mind about the future of this knight...  Having said that, 10...Bxf3!? had its points, with the Black knight coming in at d4 after the recapture at f3.} 11. Qa4 b6 12. Nd2 {Steering for b3?  Or merely to protect the c-pawn to free up the Queen?} Bd7 {If instead 12...Bh3!? White could choose between 13.Bh1 or 13.e4.} 13. Qc2 c6 {The knight seems to be doing useful work on a5!  Also playable was ...c5, which would have led to a whole different sort of game.  At this point I will allow Alexandr Kotov [AK] and Ray Keene [RK] take up much of the story, as given in Barden, Hartston and Keene's "The King's Indian Defence" Batsford 1969/1973.} 14. b4 {Alexandr Kotov [AK]:  "It would hardly make Portisch think for a long time!  The knight must retreat, following which 15.Bb2 would give White an excellent position.  However, Tal can always surprise with a trick."} Nxc4 {(!) [AK] "The beginning of a series of sacrifices.  Tal gives away nearly all his pieces.  IS the sacrifice correct?  Ask me another!  Tal's sacrifices are irresistable, precisely because it's not so simple to prove them wrong!"  To my mind there is a lot to be said for this sacrifice - as will emerge in my next note.  Tal is still just chewing on his shield rim.  The berserk charge has yet to come!} 15. Nxc4 cxd5 16. Na3 {(!) The retreat to d2 isn't so attractive owing to this line: 16.Nd2 d4!! 17.Bxa8 dxc3  18.Bg2 cxd2 19.Qxd2 Ne4! 20.Bxe4 Bxa1 with a tough battle in prospect.  Nor does 16.Nb2 prepossess.  Black has two advantageous responses in 16...d4, or 16...Ne4! 17.Bxe4 Qxc3 and a whole series of exchanges that leave Black a pawn ahead with the bishop pair. #### It seems likely thal Tal thought that after 16.Na3 then ...d4 would be just as strong as against the other options.   We'll have to see about that.  However, Black could have baled out here by 16...Bf5 17.Qb3 Ne4 with a fine game...} d4 {(??!!) [AK]  "If you said 'A' you have to say 'B'.  The sacrifice of a N is followed by the sacrifice of a R."  Now comes the berserker charge! I suspect, withal, that Tal hadn't looked though this line fully...} 17. Bxa8 {(!) Cold bloodedly taking what's on offer, confident in his defensive technique.  Nor does there seem any reason to panic... is there?} Qxa8 {Since after ...dxc3 the pawn would be striking at thin air, that capture doesn't seem so enticing as it does in the lines where the c4-knight had retreated to the 2nd rank.  On the other hand, after the text move, the Black queen and light square bishop look handily placed to exploit the weak squares around White's king.  Is that enough compensation for the material already given up?} 18. Ncb5 {This is as good a place for the knight as any, and from b5 it strikes at Black's leading d-pawn.} Rc8 {Bringing the rook into action with gain of tempo.} 19. Qd1 Ne4 {[AK] "Minus a rook, Tal plays as if nothing has happened.  His threats of ...d3 and...Nc3 are serious."  But it would seem that White could safely take the d-pawn here: 20.Nxd4 Ba4!!?  21.Qxa4 Bxd4  22.Be3! Bxa1 23.Rxa1 Nc3 24.Qc2 with an OK game.  But that's not to depreciate Portisch's actual choice of move...} 20. f3 {(!) } a6 {Extraordinary.  You would think ...d3 would be a more urgent continuation, wouldn't you?} 21. Nxd4 Qd5 {When in doubt, centralise.  Black threatens to win back a piece and tip the balance back in his favour (...Bxd4 or ...Qxd4).} 22. Be3 {[AK]  "Here Portisch could have improved with 22.Bb2 or 22.Nac2.  However, it isn't easy to choose the best continuation in such brain-racking complications."  Sure, White dared not take on e4: 22.fxe4?? Qxd4! 23.Qxd4 Bxd4  24.Be3 Bxe3 ! with much the better game for Black.  Yet it is hard to say that Kotov's suggestions are better (or worse) than the move played.  The fact is, Portisch is meeting Tal's berserker attack coolly and competently...} Rc3 {(?!)  Throwing in the reserves.  Is it enough?  We'll soon find out!} 23. Ndc2 {(!) Played with utter sang-froid.  Surely Black hasn't enough after this?  In an editorial comment on the game Ray Keene [RK] asked "Why not 23.fxe4 Qxe4 24.Bf2 - ?"  Possibly the answer is that 24...Bh3 25.Nf3 Rxa3 would have kept Black well in the fight.  Portisch absolutely refuses to panic.} Qf5 {Meanwhile, Tal sideslips to his left, the better to assault the White king.} 24. g4 {(!?) Fine, but 24.Bd4 would have closed down the dark long diagonal. Portisch probably thought it could wait until the BQ had been driven off.} Qe6 25. Bd4 h5 {(! - according to Ray Keene and Co.) But Tal must have been feeling pretty desperate by now.  Just about all Black's resources are in action and battering away at the White position, yet there doesn't seem to be the slightest chink in White's armour.  Everything is hanging together strongly.  This infantry assault must have been Tal's last hope...} 26. Bxg7 {(!) Bravo!  Portisch will not be hustled.  There's nothing against taking the bishop - so he'll take it.  Not only does this represent a reduction in material whilst well ahead, but it also has the effect (relatively speaking) of localising Black's attack.  No longer is there a threat of discovery against the a1-rook.} hxg4 {(! - again Keene, Hartston and Barden append an exclam).  Yet after White's next they admit that White could here have won with this line: 27.Bxc3 g3  28.Qd4 gxh2  29.Kh1 Ng3  30.Kxh2 Qh3  31.Kg1 Qh1  32.Kf2 Qh2  33.Ke3 Nf5  34.Kd2 Nxd4 35.Nxd4.  Black wins White's queen, but his own will be no match for White's 2 rooks and 2 knights, even with 2 extra pawns to help her.} 27. Nd4 {(!?) Should be good enough, surely (?), but the obvious bishop capture, as observed in the previous note, must have been very tempting.  } Qd5 28. fxe4 Qxe4 {[AK] "An unbelievable position!  White is up a rook and 2 pieces.  But this is just the beginning of the clash [I'll bet Lajos Portisch didn't feel that way - IAD].  It seems that the best defence is 28.e3 Rxe3 29.Ndc2."  But maybe Black would do better by 28.e3 Rxa3. } 29. Nf3 {(!) Portisch isn't afraid of complications, that's clear!  If 29...Rxa3, say, 30.Bb2 Re3? 31.Qd4 etc.  And if 29...gxf3?? 30.exf3 and Black must be running out of attack: 30...Qxf3 31.Bxc3 Qxc3 32.Rxe7  plus/minus.} Qe3+ 30. Kh1 Bc6 {(!?) Objectively speaking, probably 30...Kxg7 is as good as any.  But Tal seems to figure he hasn't time for this, and throws his last available reserve into the fray.} 31. Rf1 {(??) At last!  The first crack appears in the adamantine edifice that Portisch has erected.  He didn't dare play 31.Bxc3?? gxf3! 32.exf3 Bxf3  33.Qxf3 Qxf3  34.Kg1 Qxc3 as with 3 passed extra pawns to help, Black's Queen ought to be at least a match for White's knight and two rooks.  But maybe 31.Nc2 or 31.Qd4 would have kept Black at bay.  Of the latter move, RK had this to say: "31.Qd4? gxf3 32.Qxe3 f2  33.Qf3 Rxf3 wins for Black. "  But instead of 32.Qxe3?? in this line, White has 32.Qxc3!! with the idea 32.Qxc3 Qxc3 33.Bxc3 f2  34.e4! fxe1=Q  35.Rxe1 and a simple win for White.  } Rxa3 {(!?) Astonishing!  Did the master of the time element in chess miss something?  The irony is that in seeking to defend the critical point in his game, f3, Portisch gave time for Black to exploit that very weakness: 31...gxf3!! 32.exf3 Kxg7! 33.Nc2 Bxf3  34.Rxf3 Qxf3  35.Qxf3 Rxf3.  Black emerges with 3 pawns for the knight and at least an even game.  #### Less good (however spectacular) would have been 31...Kxg7?! straight away: 32.Nc2! gxf3!! 33.Nxe3 fxe2  34.Kg1 exd1=Q  35.Nd1 and Black's 3 extra pawns are less of a match for a whole rook.} 32. Qc1 {Attacking at once a3, c6 and e3.  What can Black do now?} gxf3 {[AK] "White cannot exchange queens: 33.Qxf3? fxe2  34.Kg1 exf1=Q  35.Rxf1 Rxe3 and Black is better."  A whole lot better, it seems to me!} 33. Qxc6 Qxe2 {Now that the bishop at c6 has met his quietus, his lay brother at f3 takes over his duties...} 34. Rfg1 {There was just no time to save the g7-bishop...} Kxg7 {AK: "Tal has regained part of what he gave away, and White is only up a rook.  However, Black's strong pawns are good compensation."  RK: "And the clock...?"  But Black is already looking fairly safe, though he seems too thin on the ground to expect a win.} 35. Rae1 {Black's invasion force seems sufficient to obviate any winning counterattack by White.  E.g. 35.Qc1 f2! 36.Qxa3 Qe4  37.Rg2 Qe1 ! 38.Rxe1 fxe1=Q  39.Rg1 Qe4  Draw!} Qd2 36. Red1 Qe2 37. Rde1 Qd2 38. Red1 Qe2 {Draw! Salo Flohr can have the ... erm ... floor, for me: "The Wild West and a happy ending."}
