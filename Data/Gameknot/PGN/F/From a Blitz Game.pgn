1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Be2 Nf6 5. O-O Nc6 6. d3 Nd4 {Black's knight moves to d4 where it could wreak havoc on my defensive structure.} 7. Nxd4 {So there is no way I could tolerate having black's knight on d4 so I used one knight to take it.  On the downside, black's pawn gets to advance by one and threaten my other knight.} cxd4 8. Nd5 {I moved my knight from where a pawn threatened it to where it could attack black's defenses.} Nxd5 9. exd5 {Black didn't want any knights threatening his pieces either, so he took the knight, and I took it back.  In just 3 moves, all 4 knights went extinct.  What remains is a stack of pawns - with black's pawns in a superior position.} Qa5 {Black's queen has plans for the lonely white pawn in the center of the board.} 10. Bf3 {The bishop moves to protect the pawn and open the e file.} g6 11. b3 h5 12. Bd2 {My plans here are to drive the queen away and continue piece development.} Qc5 13. a3 f5 14. b4 Qc7 {The black queen has gotten the message she's not welcome.} 15. Bg5 {My dark square bishop moves to its perch protected by enemy pawns.} Be7 {Except that black's bishop doesn't want my bishop in such a lovely place where it can spy on his pieces.} 16. Bxe7 {I didn't want to retreat from g5 and yield that square to black's bishop where it (and the black pawns) could exert control over my king side.} Kxe7 {I did expected black to take the white bishop with king.  By doing so, black gave up the castling privilege, and missed a chance to move the black queen to an open diagonal on the king side.} 17. Qd2 f4 18. Be4 {Black's f-pawn move allows my bishop to threaten black's g pawn.} g5 19. Rfc1 {With the rook in place, the c pawn is ready to march forward.} g4 20. c4 {If black takes the c-pawn en passant, my rook will move forward to threaten the black queen.  Once the black queen moves to safety From there, I could line up my second rook along the c-file and from there threaten black's king.} b6 {Black prepares for the coming pawn march.} 21. a4 {Getting another pawn into position.} Qd8 {Black's queen decides that discretion is the better part of valor.  This yields control of the c file to my rook because I can now go "22. c5, b6xc5. 23. b4xc5 ..." with pressure on black's d pawn.} 22. c5 bxc5 23. bxc5 Ba6 {Black moves bishop to an unprotected spot too close to the files controlled by my rooks.  I think c8 to d7 would have better because the bishop would be protected by 2 other pieces and out of harm's way.  It was here that I saw the next several moves of my strategy.  If I could get black's king on the d6 square and my rook or queen on the c6 square, I could take the unprotected bishop on a6 for free.  I would need to get my queen or other rook where it too could watch over the c file.} 24. Qb4 {Moving queen to threaten check.} Rb8 {Black doesn't want my queen along an open file.} 25. Qa3 {So the queen steps back to safety for a moment.} Qc7 {Black moves queen to continue protection of the pawn on d6.} 26. cxd6+ {The attack begins with a pawn fork!} Qxd6 {Only sensible move.  If the king retreated, the black queen would be lost for nothing.} 27. Qxd6+ {A queen exchange forces the black king onto the d6 square.} Kxd6 28. Rc6+ {And now the rook forks the black king and bishop.} Kd7 29. Rxa6 {Now I am a piece up and can threaten black with check.} Rb7 {Black moves to protect the a7 pawn.  I considered d5 to d6 opening a discovered attack on the black rook.  If the rook retreats to safety, it yields the a7 pawn to me.  However, that would leave the white pawn on d6 unprotected, so the end result is a pawn exchange.  I had other plans in mind.} 30. Bf5+ Kd8 31. Rc1 {A check by the bishop moves the black king to the back row - followed by a rook move to seize the open c file.} Re8 {Perhaps black feared a white rook moving to c8, and once the king moves to e7, I could skewer the rook in the h8 corner.  That would leave my king unprotected against a back row mate.} 32. Rac6 Ke7 {Here, the black king tries to retreat to the other side of the e8 rook.  This opens up possibilities.} 33. Re6+ Kd7 {The king moves into a nice setup for a discovered attack.} 34. Rxe5+ {Taking the pawn is better than taking the rook in this discovered attack.  If I took the rook now, the king would merely take it back.  This way, I can weaken black's pawn structure and get the rook in the next move for nearly free.} Kd6 {Now the black rook is left all alone.  Black seeing the position as hopeless decides to resign. If black continued play, I would pick off the rook on e8.  Black's king takes the pawn on d5.  The bishop moves to e4 - putting the king in check, and when the king moves back to the one safe square, the rook on b7 is left unsupported by an attack from the bishop.}
