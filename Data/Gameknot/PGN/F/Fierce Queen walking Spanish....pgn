[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C78), Archangelsk (counterthrust) variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {the Ruy Lopez, probably one of the most analyzed opening systems in the world; played for the first time in my life...} a6 {the usual and strongest reply...  other options are the Cordel variation Bc5, c3, Nf6, d4 - reminiscent to the Italian Party - or the Bird defense Nd4, Nxd4, exd4, 0-0, c6, Bc4, Nf6, bringing us back to Italian lines again...} 4. Ba4 {again the usual and strongest reply... another option is the Exchange variation Bxc6, dxc6, 0-0; brought to life again by Fischer at Havana 1966...} Nf6 5. O-O {business as usual; White could also consider the ancient Steinitz favorite d3, which is a bit slow, but very playable for White; which again Fischer showed us on several occasions in tournament play... we will try this on a next occasion...} b5 {from here, Black has usually three choices; a) open defense: Nxe4, d4, b5, Bb3, d5, dxe5, Be6, c3; b) closed defense: Be7, Re1, b5, Bb3, d6, c3, 0-0; c) d6 defense: d6, Re1, b5, Bb3, Na5, d4, Nxb3... in this game, Black clearly hasn't decided yet...} 6. Bb3 Bb7 {Black clearly ran out of theory already, and is trying to make a futile point about e4; giving White time for additional development...} 7. Nc3 {introducing Nd5 into the mixture... another strong option here is the usually played (Fischer) a4, to release Bb3, but Nc3 makes this all the more stronger after Bb7; plus: e4 is suddenly covered...} Be7 8. d3 {Black closes his defenses; since we are preparing Nd5, we pass on a direct d4, exd4, Nxd4, Nxd4, Qxd4, c5!, Qe3, with too much complications; this old Steinitz move covers e4 after Nd5...} O-O 9. Bd2 {a clever addition, if I may say so myself; keeping an eye on b4 and a5 after Nd5...} d6 {Black wants to complete his development; best is first Nd4, Nxd4 (Nxe5, b4!, Ne2, Nxb3, axb3, d5! (ruining my plans), exd5, Qxd5), exd4, to simplify before Nd5 hits...} 10. Nd5 {now or never; this will clear a path either for c4 or d4, after an additional c3...} Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Bf6 {not the best: Black should be preparing Nd8 (Na5 is impossible) to trade Bd5, and prepare c6 or c5; Qd7 (solves it rightaway) or Qc8 (supports c6/c5) were options...} 12. Be3 {we need not protect a5 anymore, since Bb3 has been replaced, and cover the all important c5; after Na5, a4!, Bxd5, exd5, b4, Nd2, c6, Qf3, followed by c3 or c4, White has the better of the play... this is preventing Nd4, and preparing d4...} Rb8 {not better, than the above variation for Black; this might well be the losing move already...} 13. c3 {still theory; enforcing d4, and preventing Nb4...} Na5 {underestimating the situation; needed was a way to put the Knight elsewhere, like Qd7, followed by Nd8; this will soon go sour...} 14. a4 {this move is what this variation is all about, and worth waiting for; now, Bd5 might even retreat to a2... needless to say, that also axb5 is a big problem; after c6, Ba2, threatening b4... Blacks' Queens' wing is about to fall apart, thanks to Rb8...} Bxd5 {not better than above variation; Black needs to find a way to cover for Na5...} 15. exd5 Qd7 {long overdue and a clear mistake at this point; last option was c5 (covers Na5), axb5, axb5, Nd2 (against e4, supporting c4), Ra8...} 16. axb5 Qxb5 {no other option left; (also) after Rxb5, c4, and after e4, Nd2, leaves Na5 lost... after Nb7, bxa6, Nc5, b4, e4, bxc5, exf3, Qxf3, Bxc3, Ra3, Bb4, c6!, Black can start worrying...} 17. c4 {no way out; after Qb4, Ra4, (or directly) Qxb2, Rxa5, Ra8, Qb1, loses quickly...} Nxc4 18. dxc4 Qxc4 19. Rc1 Qe4 {better Qa2, for obvious reasons...} 20. Rxc7 Rxb2 21. Rc6 Be7 22. Re1 {keep putting pressure on the Queen, now displaced...} Qb4 {also after Qf5, Rxa6, Rb5, Rb6, things would look not pretty for Black; this is worse...} 23. Rb6 Qc3 {probably best is Qxb6, Bxb6, Rxb6, and try to make business with the passed a-pawn; this is losing quickly...} 24. Qa1 {a bit more spectaculair would have been Bd4!!, exd4, Rxb2, Qxb2, Rxe7, Rb8/Rc8 (a5, Nxd4 or Qb5, Qxd4), Re1; but this will suffice after Rb3, Qxa6, Rxb6 (or Qd3, Qxd3, Rxd3, Rb5), Qxb6, Qd3, Qc6...} Rc8 {not sure, what happened here; maybe preparing Rxb6? that move might actually have been better, than this; I am not sure about the math of it all...} 25. Rxb2 {no mercy; Black resigned...}
