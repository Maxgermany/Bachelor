1. e4 e6 {Today's game features a player that plays regularly in blitz. In the first move, I face a black e6, which means I'm probably going against the French defense, a break from the Sicilian Defense games that I've played and encountered. I'm hoping for a Rubenstein variation as the best case scenario, as white will have a great space advantage to work with.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Sure enough, it's the French defense with a Winawer variation, which offers extremely rich positions from both sides.} 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7 {Mainline moves for the Winawer variation. I follow it up with Nf3, which allows me a few options for attack, which include a kingside assault with the h-pawn, dxc5 to open up the bishops for attack to secure a4, or a4-Ba3 to secure the queenside.} 7. Nf3 Qc7 {Common move 7 for black. I find that instinct is the key for winning when making future moves for white.} 8. a4 b6 9. Bb5+ Bd7 10. Bd3 Nbc6 {I adopt some moves from the Winawer Advance Variation and develop the kingside bishop to b5, then to d3. I move the a-pawn first to secure the queenside.} 11. O-O h6 {I castle to secure my position.} 12. Ba3 Na5 13. Qd2 O-O {If black did Bxa4, I can commence an exchange thanks to the rook and a3 bishop.} 14. Qf4 Nc4 {Here I make sure to put some pressure on the kingside as well by moving the queen.} 15. Bxc4 Ng6 {I remove bob's knight and go ahead with the exchange as it is far too close for my tastes.} 16. Qe3 dxc4 {Get my queen to safety.} 17. dxc5 Rfc8 18. cxb6 axb6 {Further press the assault on the queenside.} 19. Bd6 Qd8 {Now it's my turn to threaten the queen.} 20. Rfb1 Bxa4 {I let the pawn exchange complete for now, as I am still good tactically.} 21. Nd4 Bc6 22. Nxc6 Rxc6 {Happily accept a bishop-knight exchange.} 23. g3 Qc8 {Turn my attention away from the queenside for now.} 24. h4 Rxa1 25. Rxa1 Nf8 {Bob further chooses to continue the exchange bloodbath, which is fine by me. I tend to not be afraid of exchanging major pieces on principle, especially the queen, since fear leads to more blunders in my experience.} 26. Ra7 Nd7 {I make sure some pressure remains on the queenside though.} 27. h5 f5 28. Qf3 b5 {I secure the kingside for now.} 29. g4 fxg4 30. Qxg4 Qe8 {Another exchange occurs here. Also fine by me.} 31. Qg6 Qxg6+ {Like I said, I'm not afraid to exchange my queen. In this case, it is more than advantageous for me since I can stop the king from moving from rank 8. This will be crucial for me later.} 32. hxg6 Nb6 {Bad move for bob, as this will allow me to pin his rook.} 33. Ra6 h5 {I pin down bob's rook, his greatest threat. I use my bishop to twist the knife in the wound.} 34. Bb4 Kh8 {A bad move for black, as he should be doing Kf8 to free up his movement options, or attempting to resolve the pin that I have made. Meanwhile, I am free to use the pin to my advantage using my bishop.} 35. Ba5 Rc8 36. Rxb6 Re8 {And this is a turning point for me, as it not only gives me his knight, but a threatening mating position. If Bob moves his rook from the 8 rank, he will lose the game.} 37. Rxb5 Rc8 {While I wait for the fatal movement, I wreak havoc with bob's remaining pawns in the meantime.} 38. Bb4 Ra8 39. Rb6 Re8 {My plan is to use the bishop to further speed up the mate.} 40. Be7 {This is a possible trap, which attempts to get the rook out of the 8 rank.} Rxe7 {Sure enough, he falls for the trap, allowing me a mate in 2.} 41. Rb8+ Re8 42. Rxe8# {Thank you for reading this annotation.}
