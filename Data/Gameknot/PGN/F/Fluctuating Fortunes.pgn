[Opening "English opening (A20)"]

1. c4 e5 {The P-K4 Defence to the English Opening.  This can lead to a Reversed Sicilian, but Indian or Dutch type defences are also possible from here.} 2. e4 {What to call the beast?  Note that the thing can arise from this move order: 1.e4 e5  2.c4 - and how often do you see that?   Yet the thing is not all bad, provided White is cognizant of the hole that has appeared at d4 - a long-term strategic concession.  It remains to be seen whether White gets any benefit from this.} Nc6 {At once taking control of the d4-square.  The d4-break won't be easy for White to achieve, but for the time being he probably won't want to try for it.} 3. g3 {[!?]Aiming for a King's Indian Attack, or a Botvinnik System, maybe?  The Gameknot engine (hereafter GK) prefers more 'normal' development by 3.Nf3 Nf6  4.Nc3 Bc5  5.Be2 ...  But there is something to be said for this arrangement: g3/Bg2/Ne2/Nc3/d3/Be6 - the solid Botvinnik system.} Bc5 {There is no such thing as too much control of a vital central square.  This might turn out to be a problem for White.} 4. Bg2 d6 5. Ne2 {Consistently carrying out his plan of development.  But Black takes the opportunity here for an early strike in the centre - before completing his K-side development.  } f5 {Also playable was ...Ne7 or ...Nf6 and then ...0-0.  But this early strike can hardly be convenient for White!} 6. d3 {GK mislikes this move on account of 6...fxe4  7.dxe4  Nf6  8.0-0 0-0  9.Nd2 Ng4 -(look at the pressure on f2 right now!)-  10.Nf3 Be6  11.Qd3 Qe8  12.Nc3 ... -(See how the knights criss-cross manouevres has led them to take 4 moves to carry out a 2-move development!)-  12...Qh5  13.Nd5 ... Here GK stops short, with Black about to play the killer: 13...Rxf3!  A clear case of the so-called 'horizon effect'.  Preferable, according to GK, is 6.Nbc3 Nf6  7.exf5 Bxf5  8.Bxc6 bxc6  9.d4 ... I don't buy it.  White's K-side looks very porous to me in this line.} fxe4 7. dxe4 Nf6 {So far, as GK has foreseen, but now...} 8. h3 {Keeps Black's pieces out of g4, and so limits Black's operations against f2.} O-O 9. O-O Be6 {Black has a slight lead in development - all minor pieces now in action.  White has yet to begin mobilizing his Q-side.  Black has a distinct lead towards getting his rooks into the game.} 10. b3 {White's situation was not helped by Black's bishop developing with a threat that required a response.  There is no convenient way of defending c4, but after this move, White might have reason to fear for the dark squares on his Q-side.} Qd7 {Striking towards h3.} 11. Kh2 {There is no other way of reinforcing the defence of h3, but this will do.  But Black looks to be well set up for a direct K-side attack.} Nxe4 {[?] GK calls this a mistake, and I'm inclined to agree.  True, Black is in a fine position to attack, and needed to find a plan.  I rather like 12...Nd4 here, as 13.Nxd4 Bxd4 is very nasty for White.} 12. Bxe4 {Accepting the sacrifice, as he ought, for it is hard to see that Black gets enough attack for the Knight.  After 12...Bxh3  13.Bd5ch! ... -(a useful finesse)- ...Kh8  14.Bg2 Bxg2  15.Kxg2 Rf7  16.Nd2 Raf8   17.Ne4 Bb6  18.c5! (...dxc5  19.Qxd7 Rxd7  20.Be3.  Although Black obtains 3 pawns for the piece in this line, his attack would have been repulsed, and white would have a fine game.  On the whole one feels that Black's advantage would have been the greater for keeping his knight, and playing 11...Nd4.} Bxh3 13. Bg2 {Omitting the Bd5 Kh8 intermezzo.  Probably not very significant, but placing the BK on the half-open h-file might have been beneficial to White.  A small thing, but worth a look all the same.} Bg4 {The alternative was .13...Bxg2  14.Kxg2 Qg4.  Possibly Black simply wanted to shift the focus of his attack onto the d1-h5 diagonal.  But White's response looks effective enough.} 14. f3 {[!] White's K-side is looking pretty battered right now, but Black's first wave of attack has been beaten back.} Be6 15. Nbc3 {Seizing the moment to resume developing.  Black would very much like to bring a rook or maybe the queen over to the h-file...} Qe8 {Heading for h5.  15...Rf5 was met effectively enough by 16.g4, after which it would take some time to bring the rooks across.  Still, I might have considered 15...Rf5  16.g4 Rf7 with the idea of ...h5 (with due preparation) to try and break open some lines. } 16. g4 {Looks weakening - and in many respects it is - but any move that cuts across the enemy plans can't be all bad!  The point is that the weakness left are not so easy for Black to come at, and may require some regrouping.  } h5 {A reasonable try in the circumstances, but...} 17. g5 {...White was never going to allow further opening of lines if he could help it!} a6 {Black sees that after Nb5 White would be threatening Nc7 and a fork.  Rather than be distracted by this later on, Black deals with it at once.  But maybe Black could have let White waste time on this by, say, 17...Qg6  18.Nb5 Rf7 and then 19...a6 and 20...Rf8.} 18. Ne4 {Threatening Nxc5.} Bb6 {Black does right in keeping this bishop and its tenure of the a7-g1 diagonal.} 19. Qd3 {White's game is looking pretty good right now.The game looks about even.} Rd8 20. Ne2c3 {Heading for d5.  The last few moves have the look of the defenders, long under siege, emerging from the city walls for a sortie to break the investment.} Bd4 {Pinning the knight...  It has to be remembered, though, that Black is still a piece (for two pawns) behind.  He'll have to come up with something to redress the balance.} 21. Rb1 b5 {[?!] Very murky.  It looks as though White could win a pawn here - 22.cxb5 axb5  23.Nb5. } 22. Be3 {[?!] Instead GK recommends 21.Bh3 Bxh3  22.Kxh3 Qe6ch  23.Kh2 Nb4  24.Qe2 d5!?  25.cxd5 Nxd5  26.Nxd5  leaves White favorably placed whether Black plays 26...Rxd5 or ...Bxa1.  Together with cxb6 and Nf6ch?! White's defensive resources seem abundant.} bxc4 {Equality.} 23. bxc4 Bxe3 24. Qxe3 Bxc4 {Picking up the third pawn for the piece.  Black doesn't look too bad now.} 25. Rf2 {[?] A mistake overlooking Black's reply, after which Black is in the ascendant.  Instead 25.Rfc1 d5  26.Qc5 or 25...Nd4  26.Nd2 Be6  27.Nce4 are OK for White.  } d5 {[!] This will win back the piece Black sacrificed ... on move 11!} 26. Nd2 {[?] Understandable, but the piece is now definitely gone, after which it will be White who is material to the bad.  Instead 26.Qc5! contained the damage, and would have left White with B and N vs R and 2P.} d4 {Fork.} 27. Qe1 Bd3 {Quite a nice little finesse, but simply 27...dxc3 was good.} 28. Nce4 Bxb1 29. Qxb1 {Black has R and 3 vs B and N, instead of the 3 extra pawns he could have had after dxc3.} Rb8 {Obvious... and strong.  White's planned invasion via b7 has to be aborted, and time lost, to Black's advantage.} 30. Qd3 Rb6 {Consolidating on the Q-side.  Sensible option.  It often happens that winning material has a disruptive, disorganising effect that  requires being seen to before going over to attack.} 31. Nc5 Qf7 32. f4 {Intending after ...exf44 to play Rf2-e2-e6 and win the Knight on c6.  However, after 32...exf4  33.Re2 Nb4 Black would have kept his lead:  34.Qxd4 Nc2  35.Qd7 Ne3 -(Not 35...Qxd7??)- 36.Qxf7ch Rxf7.  There would be just too many Black pawns running about...} Nb4 {[?]  Omitting ...exf4 allows White to regain some lost ground.} 33. Qh3 {[?!]  Exchanging Queens by 33.Qc4 seems more likely to yield the draw.  Presumably White has 34.Nd7 in mind, attacking both rooks.} Rd8 {That ends White's threat.  But GK recommends 33...Rg6, threatening ...Rxg5 as more effective.} 34. Be4 {[!?]  White is eyeing h7 very closely here.  I think I would have preferred 34.f5, myself, as a promising line of attack, but the text seems a good alternative.} exf4 35. g6 {The point.  The h-pawn is cut off from all help and must fall.  Though localised, White's subsequent attack down the h-file is quite strong.} Qxa2 {[?] Wishing to keep the Queen on the a2-g8 diagonal (for reasons that will soon become apparent), Black finds the only safe square.  This also ties the rook down to defending the d2-knight.  But this is a mistake that brings White back to at least level terms.  Instead, 35...Rxg6!  36.Bxg6 Qxg6  37.Ne6 Re8  38.Nxc7 Nd3 leading to a ending with  N vs 3P that looks promising for Black.  } 36. Qxh5 {White's attack looks pretty strong.  Black may have his work cut out to hold...} Rf6 {[?] Interestingly enough, in the previous move's analysis, GK gave this as OK.  Now it reverses its view.  A clear instance of what the 'horizon effect' can mean.  Black's best defence seems to be 36...Nd5 though White can then play 37.Qh7ch kf8  38.Qh8ch Ke7  39.Qxg7ch Kd6  40.Bf5!! ... The threat is 41.Nde4ch, winning the Queen, and of course 40...Kxc5  41.Ne4ch won't change that.  Absent a safe square for the Queen, Black must succumb: [A] 40...Qa1?  41.Nde4ch Kc6  42.Bd7ch Rxd7  43.Qxd7#; or 40...Kc6 41.Bd7ch and one way or another Black's Q will fall.} 37. Qh7+ {[?!] A good move played too soon equals a bad move - or at least not the best.  White rushes his attack!  However, it must be acknowledged that the right move is not so easy to find: 37.Re2!  the threat is this: 38.Nd7!! Rxd7  39.Bxd5ch!! Qxd5  40.Re8ch Rf8  41.Qh7#.  A possible defence is 37...Kf8 but then comes 38.Bf5! Qg8  39.Nd7ch Rxd7  40.Bxd7 Rxg6  41.Qxg6 and there will be no escaping the mating net.  In this line 39.Be6 also wins, but not so quickly.} Kf8 {Forced, of course...} 38. Qh8+ {[?!] White must have overlooked, forgotten or otherwise underestimated the Black Queen's long retrograde defensive move.  Had he seen it betimes, he might have tried cutting off the Queen altogether from the defence of the King: 38.Ncb3! Rdd6  39.Qh8ch Ke7  40.Qxg7ch Kd8  41.Qg8ch! Ke7 42.Qh7ch Kd8  43.g7 with a decisive edge: 43...Rh6ch  44.Kg1! Rxh7  45.g8=Qch Kd7   46.Qxh7ch Kd8  47.Rxf4 and wins.  Of course this is going really deep into the position, but even just two or three moves in, it is clear that Black is in a bad way.} Qg8 {The saving resource!  White's attack is almost completely thrown back...} 39. Qh4 {[?!] A further square's retreat would have kept some attack glimmering, threatening Nd7ch.  For instance: 39.Qh3 Nd5 (say)  40.Nd7ch Ke7  41.Bxd5! Qxd5  42.Nxf6 Kxf6  43.Rxf4ch and even with the scanty material remaining, White still has significant winning chances.  Instead White was eyeing the exchange on f4.} Rdd6 {Instead, ...Nd5 would have cut across White's next...} 40. Rxf4 Nd5 {Probably better than 40...Rxf4 41.Qxf4.  Black is starting to consolidate once more.} 41. Bxd5 Qxd5 {After this, has White any more attack?} 42. Qh8+ {[??] I am quite at a loss to explain this.  For the second time this check leads where the it did the first time: nowhere.  The thing is, this check has a powerful potential - it just needs to be timed correctly, as earlier analysis has indicated.  Instead 42.Rxf6ch!  Rxf6??  43.Qh8ch! Qg8  44.Nd7ch would have been lethal.  Black would have had to play 42....gxf6 and even then 43.Nde4 would have kept Black on the defensive:  43...Qa2ch  44.Kh3 Qa3ch  45.Ng3 Qxc5  46.g7. } Qg8 43. Rxf6+ {[?] Instead White could have tried again with 43.Qh4, and probably have had enough to secure the draw.  After this, the advantage changes hands once more...} gxf6 44. g7+ {There's nothing better, yet can this possibly lead anywhere?} Kf7 {Now White's sole remaining pawn is a goner.} 45. Nde4 Rb6 46. Nd7 {Maybe 46.Qh5ch kept White at least fighting on: 46...Kxg7  47.Ng3 Rb2ch  (GK, though I'd probably go for 47...Qh7, forcing off the Queens).} Rb2+ 47. Kg3 Qxg7+ 48. Qxg7+ Kxg7 {Two knights versus rook and four: steep odds...} 49. Nexf6 {[?] Hastens the end, but really White hasn't had the ghost of a chance since his 43rd move.} d3 50. Nd5 d2 51. Ne3 Rb3 {[0-1] Nothing will stop the d-pawn now. White resigned.   An engrossing game, with all sorts of chances for both sides.  To be fair to White, the strong attack he developed late in the game was enormously complicated, and not all easy to determine the best way to carry on.  Check out the Qh8ch moves, as played, and in the analysis.  Sometimes it was an excellent move, occasionally so-so, and at other times it was a bad move.  It was the sort of game in which you could expect the odd inaccuracy even at the highest levels,  Well done, both players!}
