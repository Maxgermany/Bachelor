1. d4 {I've handled the opening better than my opponent, and the result of this should be a long endgame were I had a strategic objective in the attack of an isolated pawn with bishop plus knight against double knights, but then opponent blundered a piece for a pawn, in a other wise controlled position, which eased my win...} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 Bg7 5. e3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Nh5 {in the game Roggon Jacob (GER) - Jachnowitsch Kristjan-John, Neumuenster (Germany), 2002, white played Bg3 and the game ended in a draw} 7. Nd5 {N Nd5!? very interesting move by white, he forces the exchange of knight by bishop.. still not sure what he aims with this strategic decision, but it seams very interesting indeed } Nxf4 8. Nxf4 c5 9. Qa4+ Bd7 {now i expect one of two possible choices: a) Qb3 a nice threat on f3 but also a miss directed threat against b7, a poisoned pawn if white take he loses a rook b) Bb5 the more appealing choice in white's point of view, but allows me to force an isolated pawn for white with cxd4} 10. Bb5 {!? white chooses the second hypothesis...} cxd4 {as planed} 11. Bxd7+ Qxd7 12. Qxd7+ Kxd7 {all forced replies for black, white simplifies but get's a worst endgame, let's see if he can hold it to a draw} 13. O-O-O {!? white is choosing not to isolate his pawn, at least not immediately, let's see what does he have planed to do } Nc6 {developing and connecting rooks} 14. Nf3 {developing as I did} e5 {defends d4 with tempo} 15. Nd3 {! very  good, I only saw the more obvious Ne2 but this results in a better position for white, if I blunder with the fork e4 he has Nc5 with tempo destroying my advantage, and even when I move my king out of danger to c7 my opponent is doing fine, although he allows me a passed pawn, after 15....Kc7 I expect to see 16.e4 blocking my e5 pawn and closing the position with my pawns on dark squares and creating an outpost on d5 both good for his knights...} Kc7 {forced} 16. Kb1 {?? now I'm starting to think Nd3 was just a lucky good move, after this he just blunders a piece...} e4 {forking the knights, now hes hasn't have Nc5 to save his knight with tempo} 17. Nxd4 exd3 {and here it is, how white just lost the perspective...} 18. Nb5+ {my opponent now uses some dilatory moves...} Kb6 {with tempo so now I can defend the d pawn, although I would prefer if white captured the d pawn as then I could have had exchanged another piece, now that's my aim strategically speaking} 19. Na3 Ka6 {avoids the predictable Nc4+ and sacrifices a pawn to force the exchange of rooks or try to infiltrate the 2nd rank} 20. Rxd3 Rhd8 {and now white has to chose between allowing exchange or infiltration of his 2nd rank} 21. Rb3 {so he doesn't want the exchange...I'll infiltrate then...} Rd2 22. Nc4 Rxf2 {now I'll defend f7, while getting a pawn, now maybe white will play Ra3+ another dilatory move that achieves nothing other than add another move to the game...} 23. Ra3+ {...} Kb5 {with tempo} 24. Nd6+ {expected hence Rxf2} Kb6 25. Rb3+ Kc7 {with tempo} 26. Nb5+ {white is very predictable... } Kd7 {...now I'll shift the king to the other wing, and we'll see a rook move to the d column, probably Rd1+, with the idea of a latter Rxb7, but maybe also Rd3+} 27. Rd1+ {expected...} Ke7 {Re8?? (or for that mater Re6??) and white has Nc7+ that wins the a rook} 28. Nd6 Nd4 {! blocks the rook, allowing the exchange of another piece} 29. Rxb7+ Kxd6 {now when exd4 I have Re8 to infiltrate another rook on the 2nd rank} 30. exd4 Re8 31. Rxa7 Ree2 {now, I may need to bring my king back to the king's wing to take cover while attacking the exposed white king, let's see what white is about to do first, checks along the a column, Rb7 to defend b2... I'll expect him to surrender soon, and he did resigned}
