1. d4 {In this game, I play a speculative sacrifice. My opponent goes wrong and loses easily. I was dissappointed that the post-game computer analysis says my sac was not the best move in the position? What do you think dear reader?  Can anyone see what an independent search engine says is best in the position?} f5 2. g3 {So was start as a standard Dutch defence} Nf6 {Routine development.} 3. Bg2 g6 {Black decides to fianchetto her King's side Bishop too.} 4. Nh3 Bg7 {My knight goes to h3 so as not to block the Bg2} 5. Nf4 Nc6 {Still fairly standard} 6. h4 {PLayed to ancor the Nf4 and deter g5, and also with the possibility of attacking with h5 at some stage.} e5 {The usual reply.} 7. dxe5 {Taking is about White's only sensible option.} Nxe5 8. c3 {c3 scores well on the opening databases} c6 9. Be3 {So I attempt to follow Rukavina, Dario (2194) vs. Mijatovic, Vladimir (2134)} d6 {But in that game black continued with Qe7, so I have to start thinking for myself.} 10. Nd2 {So I continue to develop} Qc7 {So does she. This is actually the first mistake according to the post game computer, which gives Nfg4 11. Bd4 c5 12. Bxe5 dxe5 13. Nh3 e4 14. Nc4 Qxd1+ 15. Rxd1 O-O 16. h5 Be6 17. Nd6 Rab8 18. hxg6 hxg6 and a slight advantage to Black.} 11. Qb3 {So I decide to make castling hard for her.} Qf7 {She offers the queen exchange} 12. Qb4 {I avoid and hit d6.} d5 {d5 is also given as a mistake, and I tend to agree. Post game computer gives Nfg4 13. Qxd6 Nxe3 14. fxe3 Bd7 15. O-O-O O-O-O 16. Bd5 Qf8 17. Qxf8 Rhxf8 18. Ne6 cxd5 19. Nxg7 Kc7, again with slight advantage to Black. But now, what is Black to do about castling and developing the Bc8?} 13. O-O-O {So I castle} b6 {Aha, Bb7 or Ba6 is planned} 14. Qd6 {So I hit c6} Qe7 {She defends.} 15. Qxe7+ {Exchanging is just about forced now} Kxe7 {She recaptures} 16. Bd4 {I improve my bishop} Nf7 {She retreats.} 17. Bxd5 {Now this is the key moment. Post game computer gives 17. c4 Bb7 18. cxd5 cxd5 19. Nxd5+ Bxd5 20. Bxd5 Rac8+ 21. Kb1 Rhd8 22. Nf3 Nxd5 23. Bxg7 a6 24. Nd4 Nd6 with White ahead 1.25, but I am not convinced that this is right. What do you, and your search engines think? } cxd5 {So she takes} 18. Bxf6+ {and I take.} Kf8 {And this is where she really backs out! She she gives back the piece without a fight leaving me a pawn up. The computer gives Bxf6 19. Nxd5+ Kd6 20. Nf3 Bb7 21. Nxb6+ Ke6 22. Nxa8 Rxa8 23. h5 g5 24. Rd3 g4 25. Re3+ Be4 26. Nd4+ Ke5 27. Nb5 Kd5 28. Rd1+ Kc4 as best for Black with only a slight advantage to White. I commented at the time, "I am not sure that you have played the best defence, you could have gone in for variations where you had 2 minor pieces v my rook and 2, maybe 3 pawns. Still material advantage to me, but less clear...."} 19. Bxg7+ {So I exchange } Kxg7 {She recaptures} 20. Nf3 {Not really aiming at the d5 pawn, but aiming to put the Nf3 on d4, dominating the centre.} Bb7 {So now I can take the pawn d5, but why? Her bishop is tied up protecting it, my pieces are so active.} 21. h5 {so I continue to open lines} Rhe8 {so quits the h file} 22. Nd4 {I take up the dominating post} Kf6 {she centralises the king} 23. hxg6 {I take} hxg6 {she takes back} 24. Rh7 {I advance} Rad8 {She gives d5 more protection} 25. Rdh1 {But now I dominate the h file} Reh8 {She challenges it} 26. Kd2 {I centralise my king} Rxh7 {She exchanges} 27. Rxh7 Rh8 {and again...} 28. Rxh8 {so I take} Nxh8 {she takes back} 29. Nb5 {she commented "Hmm, Charles, you could have quite easily got a second pawn but you decided to press for a mating attack down the h column - unfortunately for you it has not come off but I think I am in for a tough endgame one pawn to the bad - Joanne"} a6 {and I said "I think you are too...." a6 is given as a mistake by the post-match computer, and gives â€¦ g5 30. Nd3 a5 31. Ke3 Nf7 32. Kd4 Ke6 33. a4 Bc6 34. Na7 Bb7 35. b3 Ba6 36. Nc6 Kd6 37. Nb8 Bb7 38. e3 as Black's best bet, but it is still lost!} 30. Nd6 {hitting the bishop} Bc6 31. Nc8 {and now the pawn b6} b5 {and now her bishop is terrible! All her pawns are on the same coloured squares as her bishop, blocking its movements.} 32. Nb6 Ke5 33. Nd3+ Kd6 34. Nc8+ Kc7 35. Ne7 Kd6 36. Nxc6 Kxc6 37. Nb4+ {Now Black cannot avoid losing a second pawn.} Kd6 38. Nxa6 Nf7 39. Nb4 Ne5 40. b3 Ng4 41. f3 Ne5 42. Ke3 g5 43. Kd4 {and now Black cannot avoid losing a third pawn, so she throws in the towel. Please leave a comment or two and don't forget to rate my annotation to let me know how I am doing!}
