[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03), exchange, Karpov variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 {This is the Alekhine's Defense. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre, with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. White's imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4, d4, e5, and f4. It's an aggressive choice by my opponent.} 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Nb6 {Already violates important opening rules about having to move the same piece twice. But I guess as a master you are allowed to break the traditional rules every once in awhile. } 5. exd6 cxd6 {Exchange Variation: 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6... the sharper of the options is the 5...cxd6 line, Black usually aims to attack and undermine the white pawn on d4, and possibly c4 as well. To do this, a usual plan involves a fianchetto of the king bishop to g7, playing the other bishop to g4 to remove a knight on f3, which is a key defender of d4, while black knights on b6 and c6 bear down on the white pawns on c4 and d4.} 6. Nc3 g6 7. Bd3 Bg7 8. Be3 {I considered Nf3, but seeing how Black can exploit the pin with Bg4 and take d4 anyway, I like this option a bit better. Even though knights should be developed before bishops, I "violate this rule" for the sake of protecting my center pawns.} O-O 9. Nge2 {Continuing to defend d4. As stated earlier, the goal of the opening choice for Black usually aims to attack and undermine the white pawn on d4, and possibly c4 as well. To do this, a usual plan involves a fianchetto of the king bishop to g7, playing the other bishop to g4 to remove a knight on f3 which is a key defender of d4, while black knights on b6 and c6 bear down on the white pawns on c4 and d4.} d5 {Black moves his first pawn to the center. Perhaps a bit stronger would be Nc6, as the GK engine notes.} 10. c5 Nc4 {! - Attacking e3 and should I allow it, black wins d4...} 11. Bxc4 {...so I allow this exchange. This bishop isn't doing much for me anyway, and my queen is activated to add additional protection to the d4 pawn.} dxc4 12. O-O {After the opening, White has a development lead and a nice claim to the center. I think my position is a little better right now.} Bf5 {! - preparing to bring a piece into my territory.} 13. b3 {! - responding by attacking black's lone pawn. This weakens my knight on c3 significantly, but feel this was needed to counter what Black wants to do.} Bd3 14. bxc4 Bxc4 {Black's bishop is safe as I cannot attack it currently, and it is in a prime spot on the board to attack and pin my knight on e2.} 15. Rb1 Ba6 16. Qc2 Nc6 17. Rfd1 {Unpinning my knight!} Qd7 18. Nb5 {Planning to exchange: Bxb5 Rxb5! and attacking b7 once again.} Nb4 19. Rxb4 {Not the piece I wanted but oh well I need to try something else.} Bxb5 20. Nc3 Ba6 21. d5 Rfd8 22. Qd2 e6 23. d6 {And white has a passed pawn! This would be crucial later in the game.} Rac8 24. Bd4 f6 25. Ne4 {Attacking f6 and defending d6. With Black's bishop preoccupied elsewhere, I feel comfortable until Black plays f5, but this allows me to get that bishop on Black's kingside.} Rdf8 26. f4 {Guarding against e5!} h6 {?! - I did not understand this move. Perhaps to give his king an escape square should it be attacked?} 27. Rb2 {?! - Perhaps a4 or h3 should have been played here. Guess I was unsure of what to do at the time.} Kh7 28. Kh1 {Again, unsure of what to do. Looking back, this was the best response I think given the position.} e5 {Black begins to counter attack my bishop.} 29. fxe5 fxe5 30. Be3 {!? - Keeping it involved in the defense of my pawns.} Bb5 31. Rbb1 Ba4 32. Rde1 Bc6 33. Qd3 Qf5 {! - A nice response forces me to pull the Bishop back to keep my knight.} 34. Bg1 g5 35. Rbd1 {Adding security to d6, even though it wasn't currently being attacked.} Kh8 36. Re2 Qg6 37. Rde1 Rf4 38. g3 Rf7 {And once again, Black retreats to come up with a different plan of attack.} 39. Rd2 {Preparation for d7! GK recommends a4... I guess it's a line I didn't really consider. Alternative: 39. a4?! Rcf8 40. a5 a6 41. Qc2 Qh5} Bf8 40. Bf2 Qe6 41. Kg1 Bg7 42. Qb3 Qd7 43. Qd1 b6 {I foresaw this being a mistake that would give me a decisive edge. I basically get 2 pawns for the price of one here, so I felt the need to take.} 44. cxb6 axb6 45. Bxb6 Qf5 {? - Taking his eye off my d-pawn} 46. Nc5 Rb8 {Attacks the bishop} 47. g4 {I counter with an attack on the queen. GK says d7 was better.} Qf4 48. d7 {! - I finally advance my pawn. One more step to promotion!} Bf6 {?? - Defending against the promotion, but leaves himself vulnerable.} 49. Nd3 Qa4 50. Nxe5 {And Black resigns. The double attack on c6 and f7, a promotion, there is a lot for Black to overcome.}
