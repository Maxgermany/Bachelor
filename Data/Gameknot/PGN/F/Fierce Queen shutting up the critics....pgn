1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nd4 {a known trap, in the Italian party: after Nxe5?, Qg5, White might expect a lot of trouble and sharp counterplay; best is just Nxd4, exd4, c3...} 4. c3 {or just this...} Nxf3+ 5. Qxf3 Qf6 {ideal would have been d4: maybe even just 0-0; I was not sure...} 6. Be2 Qxf3 7. Bxf3 Nf6 8. d4 exd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Bd2 Bxd2+ 11. Nxd2 O-O 12. O-O {things have turned out well for White: now for some plan...} d6 13. Nb3 c6 14. Rfe1 Bg4 15. e5 dxe5 16. dxe5 Bxf3 17. gxf3 Nd5 18. Nc5 b6 19. Ne4 Rfe8 20. Nd6 Re6 21. Re4 {mainly against Rg6+: I was not sure yet, what to expect...} Rd8 22. Rae1 Rg6+ 23. Rg4 Re6 24. Ree4 {the only move, I could think of: White is trying to prepare f4...} c5 25. f4 Rdxd6 {a small combination, on the surface winning a piece: faulty, because after exd6, Rxe4, d7, all seems over for Black: but I had my unjust doubts...} 26. f5 {this was my plan, so I missed the win...} Nf6 {I have no doubt, Black had better here: he is trying to capitalize on his material advantage; but he is not paying attention...} 27. fxe6 {restoring the material balance, and presenting Black with a whole new world of pain: his King is suddenly in an awkward postion...} Rd1+ {trying to win tempo, to haul in Nf6: but leaving the Kings' row, will prove lethal...} 28. Kg2 Nxg4 29. e7 {Black had counted on Rxg4, fxe6, with a better endgame: but this ends it all; so he resigned, without even trying: time was no issue here...}
