1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 {Here playing black with the Sicilian defense. It's a blitz game.} 3. d3 {Most of the time, people play d4, giving more chance to attack, but it's always nice to vary.} g6 {I always prefer to play the flanchetto when I'm playing black. The dragon is not always the most reliable defense in the Sicilian, but I think it can give some great attacking chances. } 4. Be2 Bg7 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bg5 h6 {I always like to play h6 when I have the chance, it can be really useful. It give can help for a king side attack or give space for my king. Now I will have an idea what white want to do with his bishop.} 7. Be3 {Bh4 is more consistent but Be3 is still fine.} Nf6 8. Qd2 {White threats h6 and is ready to castle. His position look fine.} Ng4 {! Ready to remove his excellent bishop.} 9. O-O-O Nxe3 10. fxe3 {! Now white can take the f line and take advantage of the center.} O-O 11. Rdf1 Be6 {Planing to attack the white king.} 12. h3 {?! I think e4 was a must at this time. White lack of space to create some offensive.} Qb6 13. g4 Bxa2 {?! It was a very instinctive sacrifice. White cannot answer with Nxa2 because of Qxb2 15.Kd1 Qxa2. The only solution for white was to play b3.} 14. b3 Bxc3 {Bxb3 15.cxb3 Qxb3 could have led to an interesting game too, but without my rooks I was not certain to create a good enough attack.} 15. Qxc3 c4 {! The idea here was to open the c file and to give the opportunity to do Qxe3+ or to free my bishop.} 16. dxc4 a5 {I continue to attack and to get space.} 17. Kb2 {White cannot do Qb2 to get the bishop because of Qxe3+. Maybe Kd2 would have been a better solution here.} a4 18. Kxa2 {?! I think Ra1 would have been better here.} axb3+ 19. Kb1 bxc2+ 20. Kxc2 Ra2+ 21. Kc1 {If Kd1 then Qb1+ 22.Qc1 Qxc1 23.Kxc1 24.Rxe2  Either way, I take his bishop. If Kd3 then Nb4+ and I take his queen.} Rxe2 22. Nd4 Nxd4 {Rxe3?! 23.Qxe3 Nxd4 could have been an interesting line, but white could have probably been able to defend against it.} 23. exd4 Ra8 {My position is pretty nice at this point. White cannot move his queen because of Ra1#. Rxe4 would have been better} 24. Rfe1 Raa2 {I have taken some time to check if there was not a way to move to sac my queen for the mate, but finally I think Ra2 was my best chance. Maybe with the other rook it would have been better.} 25. Rxe2 Rxe2 26. Re1 Rh2 {Here come a nice fight between queen+rook.} 27. Rd1 {Now white can try to exchange rooks.} Qc6 {! Give a nice tempo.} 28. d5 Qa4 {Now white look almost in a zugzwang position.} 29. Rd2 Rh1+ 30. Kb2 Qa1+ 31. Kb3 Qb1+ {I was planning here to do Rb1+, but I thought that I didn't had an enough advantage for the end-game, because the white king would have been ready to attack the b file.} 32. Rb2 Qd1+ {Qxe4 could have been nice here but it would have been hard to attack the king again after that.} 33. Ka3 {I was thinking to do Qf1 to be able to do Rxh3, but white would have reacted with Rb3. It looked to me a draw position.} Qa1+ 34. Kb3 {I think Kb4 would have been better.} Qd1+ 35. Ka3 Qa1+ 36. Kb3 {Now it's the right time to do Qf1!} Qf1 {!} 37. Ka4 {? Kb4 would have been better.} Rxh3 38. Qd4 Qa1+ {The end is near!} 39. Kb4 Qa3+ 40. Kb5 {Trapped!} Qa6+ 41. Kb4 Ra3 {! Bye bye!} 42. Rb3 Qa5# {Fun game, I have really enjoyed this queen+rook fight.}
