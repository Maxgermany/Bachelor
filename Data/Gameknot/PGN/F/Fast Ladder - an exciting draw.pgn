1. d4 {Nearly all my games on the Fast Ladder have been against lower-rated opposition whom I challenged because they were higher up the ladder, so in most I have been Black.  Recently, the tables have been turned on me as higher-rated played lower down the ladder have challenged me.  Here is one such challenge I survived by the skin of my teeth.  I open with 1.d4, which has recently been my habit against higher-rated players.} d5 2. c4 e5 {Black replies with the Albin Counter-Gambit, a favourite of two of my colleagues at Didcot Chess Club. Despite several knockabout games at the club, I still don't know it.} 3. dxe5 {This seems to be the principled response.} d4 {This pawn is designed to be a thorn in White's front.} 4. Nf3 {I hasten my development, attacking the pawn at the same time and inadvertently avoid the Lasker Trap: "The careless move 4.e3? can lead to the Lasker Trap. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 dxe3 6.Bxb4?? is a blunder â€” 6...exf2+ 7.Ke2 fxg1=N+ and Black wins. The Lasker Trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion as early as move 7." ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albin_Countergambit )} c5 {Black bolsters the pawn, establishing a powerful centre that I'm going to have to play around.} 5. g3 {As mentioned, I decide to develop around the Black pawns, rather than challenge them directly with 5. e3 (The Lasker trap would no longer work because the pawn on c5 prevents 5...Bb4+).  Of 5. g3, Wikipedia says: "Perhaps White's surest try for an advantage is to fianchetto his king bishop with 5.g3 followed by Bg2 and Nbd2. Black will often castle queenside. A typical continuation is 5.g3 Be6 6.Nbd2 Qd7 7.Bg2 0-0-0 8.0-0 Bh3."} Be6 6. b3 {I diverge from Wikipedia's line, not that I was following it at the time (I'm just using it as reference for the annotation).  I think this move is in the Gameknot database, though.  It's consistent with my avoidance of 5. e3 and plan to fianchetto, defending the c4 pawn with another pawn.} Nc6 {Black continues to develop his Queenside, probably preparing Queenside castling.} 7. Bg2 Qa5+ 8. Bd2 {Counter-attacking Black's Q but depriving my QN of its best square.} Qc7 9. O-O {Offering the e-pawn back for developing.} O-O-O {Black ignores the offer to get his K to relative safety.} 10. Bf4 {Now I defend the pawn to make room for my QN.} h6 {Black prepares to push the B back again.} 11. Na3 {Now developing the N to d2 would have deprived the B of retreat squares, so it goes to a3, hoping to attack from b5.} a6 {Black scotches that idea.} 12. Nc2 {A knight on the rim is dim and he has no future over there, so he heads back towards the centre.} g5 {As predicted, the B is pushed back} 13. Bd2 Nxe5 {and Black finally wins back his pawn.} 14. Qe1 {Threatening to skewer Q and R from a5, a threat easily parried, but it also gets my Q off the d-file, which Black has occupied with a Rook.} Nc6 15. Rd1 {White is preparing to break out in the centre some time soon.} Bf5 {Attacking the loose N on c2.} 16. e4 {?! As the game developed, this didn't turn out badly but it desrves at least a "dubious" because I'd failed to see the force of Black's reply.} Re8 {! The pawn is pinned and can't be defended.} 17. exf5 {! I think this was making the best of a bad job.   On conventional scoring, I only lose 1 point and should be able to contest control of the centre.} Rxe1 18. Rfxe1 Nf6 {Black hastens to develop his remaining pieces.  For a gambiteer, he is surprisingly behind in development but has got rid of White's Queen.} 19. a3 {A slow move, depriving Black's QN of a key square and preparing to open a second front in front of Black's K.} Bd6 {Pointing at White's kingside.  If Black can get in a few moves with his h-pawn, he will have a powerful attack.} 20. b4 {White continues with his plan.} d3 {Black seizes the opportunity to harass the N that defends b4.  The downside of this move is that the pawn is now out on a limb (well, in thin air really!)} 21. Ne3 {White uses the square released by Black's last move to threaten to occupy d5, attacking Black's Q.} cxb4 {Black goes for the extra pawn, by opening up the position in front of his K and Q.} 22. Nd5 Nxd5 23. cxd5 g4 {Rather than 23...N moves 24. Rc1 pinning Q against K.  Now some careful calculations are required...} 24. dxc6 gxf3 25. Bxf3 bxc6 26. Bxb4 {Winning back the b-pawn while I can, before going after the c-pawn; also revealing an attack on the loose d-pawn.} Bxb4 27. axb4 Rd8 28. Rd2 {Preventing the d-pawn from advancing.   28. Rc1 would have been a blunder because of the fork.} c5 29. Rc1 {Pinning the c-pawn} c4 {which advances to (apparently) defend the d-pawn, though of course it is pinned ....} 30. Be4 {Because of the pin, this threatens to win the d-pawn.} Rd4 {This attacks the B but makes no difference to the calculation of the capture on d3.} 31. Bxd3 Qd7 {Black sidesteps the pin.  Now either the B or the R behind it appears doomed but I spot a neat trick based on a revealed check.} 32. Bxc4 {Apparently this loses the Rd2 but ...} Rxd2 33. Be6+ {! Revealed check: Black can't block it sensibly because the Q is pinned by the B, which can't be taken because of the check.  I think this move was difficult to spot because the square appears to be well defended by Black's Q and f-pawn.} Kb7 34. Bxd7 Rxd7 {Now White is two clear pawns ahead but the advantage is difficult to exploit because one of them is doubled and Black has a remote pawn that soon becomes a passed pawn.  I think I should have prevented that from happening.} 35. g4 {? inviting Black to fork White's 4th rank pawns.} Rd4 {!  This is a powerful fork.  White doesn't want Black to take either pawn, one of which restrains Black's a-pawn, one provides a direct line to White's King.} 36. h3 {? The easy option but in retrospect the b-pawn was the more important to save.} Rxb4 37. Re1 {Preparing to counter-attack on the 7th rank and hoping then to promote the advanced f-pawn.} Rc4 {Black prepares to block the check and defend his f-pawn at the same time.} 38. Kf1 {Moving the King within the queening square (both Black's a-pawn and White's K are 5 moves from a1).} a5 39. Re7+ {I need the tempo provided by this check to enable my k to get across the board.  I may also be able to snaffle the f-pawn or get behind the a-pawn if Black errs.} Rc7 40. Re1 {I decided to keep Rooks on as I didn't trust my ability to both capture the a-pawn and get back to defend or promote my own pawns in a pure pawn endgame.  After 40. Rxc7+ Kxc7, White's K would be 5 moves from capturing the a-pawn.  Black could use those 5 moves to capture the rear f-pawn and would then be able to hunt down the remaining pawns if White's King scuttled back across the board.  White would have to deploy careful tactics to try to get a passed pawn while Black's King was in pursuit.} Kb6 41. Rb1+ {So I opted for trying to prevent Black from moving his pawn by delivering frontal checks. Black can't move away from his R or pawn else he loses one or both.  If he retreats behind the pawn he can't support its advance effectively.} Kc5 42. Rc1+ Kb6 {Black had to defend the R} 43. Rb1+ Kc5 44. Rc1+ Kb6 45. Rb1+ {I couldn't see a way of forcing a win, so was happy to implicitly offer a draw by repetition.} Kc5 {With this move, Black offered the draw that Gameknot would have declared next move anyway.}
