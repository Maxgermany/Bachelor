1. c4 {This game started out very closed were white had the bishop pair but could not profit from it due to the mentioned closed structure, while allowing white the bishop pair, I still inflicted a long lasting structural damage on his queen side pawn structure. White temporarily blocked the king side and I opened up the queen side for some serious counter-play and was able to force the exchange of pieces wining one pawn, latter on white blundered positionally and allowed me to get the upper hand and exert some pressure on his king until he finally cracked. Worth mention the queen maneuver that won a pawn: Qa8- to c6 (attacking a pawn) then from c6 to e8 and finally to h5 were it helped to win the f5 pawn} e5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 h6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. e4 {?! now I can exchange as the resulting position will be very closed for white's light squares bishop, so the bishop pair lacks the importance it might get on other types of positions...} Bxc3 {I expect the sequence bxc3 d6} 6. bxc3 d6 {placing my pawns on dark squares is my motto now... this frees the light squared bishop} 7. Ne2 {...just wanted to castle, or is this preparation to play d4?} b6 {again places my pawns on dark squares, and prepares to hit c4, a potential weak pawn on white's structure} 8. d3 Nbd7 {headed to c5} 9. O-O O-O 10. h3 Nc5 {Nbd7-c5 and not the immediate Nc6 to let the a8-h1 diagonal free for my bishop} 11. f4 Bb7 {here it is the bishop assuming the best position} 12. f5 {blocking the position in the king's wing, I'll react on the opposed wing} a6 13. g4 Nfd7 {preventing the king's wing pawn storm with tempo...} 14. Be3 b5 {and now, I'll open the other wing for operation with this pawn break} 15. cxb5 axb5 {the b pawn is easily defended and my rook is immediately activated with a latent threat on the a pawn} 16. Ng3 {white resumes the activity on the king's wing} Kh7 {prophylactic leaving the a2-g8 diagonal, so white doesn't have use for Qb3} 17. Qd2 {and he gives me reason by moving his queen away from the b3 diagonal} Ra3 {threatening also c3} 18. Qb2 Qa8 19. Bc1 Ra4 {!? "sacrifices" the b pawn to set a little trap, if Qxb5 then Ba6 would win back the pawn and set white's field on fire with black's positional advantage} 20. Qc2 {! not the mentioned Qxb5} Nf6 {inviting g5} 21. g5 hxg5 22. Bxg5 {and white kindly obliged} Ncd7 {releasing the c column to allow a pawn push and defends the knight} 23. Bf3 {white now has an semi-open g column cramped with his own pieces he might be trying to fix that} d5 {but he hasn't got the time for it, I reply with another pawn break to undermine white's structure} 24. Rfe1 dxe4 {now I expect either: - dxe4 with permanent weakness on e4 and three isolated and thus also weak pawns a2, c3 and h3... - Bxe4 exchanging the bad bishop for a knight, but still keeping permanent weaknesses on e4, c3, a2 and h3 - or the less probable Nxe4?!, not forcing the exchange and keeping the bad bishop and weaknesses on a2, c3, d3, f5 and h3... all pawns scattered around the field! } 25. Bxe4 {realistically this might be the best for white, as his bishop is his worst piece} Nxe4 26. dxe4 f6 {now it opens an escape route for my king via f7 and adds strength to my pawn structure with tempo, I expect to see Be3 due to the threat Nc5 immediately hitting one of white's weak pawns on e4...} 27. Bc1 {?? what was my opponent idea? Ba3 to skewer the knight and rook isn't possible... did he missed Nc5?} Nc5 {as planed, I now have a nice advantage} 28. Kh2 Nxe4 29. Nxe4 Bxe4 30. Qf2 Qc6 {attacking c3, and headed to h5 via e8 to strengthen the attack on white's lonely f pawn } 31. Re3 Rd8 {occupies the open column and remains defending the 8th rank} 32. Bd2 {he might be thinking of Rd3, also this move serves to activate his a rook, although it remains tied to the defense of the a pawn} Qe8 {and now as planed I'll go for Qh5} 33. Rg3 Qh5 {here it is the f pawn is lost for white} 34. Be3 Bxf5 {capture with which piece? the bishop jumps to sight as hits another pawn... but the queen allows white the chance for an exchange of queens, which might be better for me, but one never knows what might be the opponents ideas, so I'll go for the more efficient Bxf5...} 35. Rag1 {white is focusing his counter-play on an attack on g7, but with my reply he doesn't have tempi for it} Rh4 {even if he captures the g pawn then I have Kh8 and Rxh3 next} 36. Qg2 {forced} g5 {forced} 37. Rf1 {? blunder...} Be4 {and the win should not escape now! Rf3 is forced as white's queen can't move away from g2, and after Rf3 forced Bxf3 wins the quality and the game either by Rxf3 g4 Rg3 Rxh3+ Rxh3 Qxh3+ Qxh3 gxh3 and white can't recapture due to Rd3 wining the bishop or Qxf3 Qxf3 Rxf3 g4 transposing to a similar variation... either way the three pawns are pretty much self imposing!} 38. Qf2 {? Rf3 was needed to secure the h pawn, but wasn't much better because I could have forced a won technical endgame, now g4 forces the capture of the h pawn and exposes the white king, again white lacks enough tempi for any counter-play, mate should follow} g4 {the final stone on white's h pawn grave}
