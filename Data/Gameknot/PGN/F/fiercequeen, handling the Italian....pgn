1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {the signature move...} Nf6 {considered weak: Bc5, and then Nf6...} 4. Ng5 {here is why: f7 is under pressure...} d5 {the only move...} 5. exd5 Nxd5 {not the best: best is Na5, Bb5+, c6, dxc6, bxc6, Qf3!...} 6. Nxf7 {the Fegatello attack: Fischer called this the Fried Liver attack...} Kxf7 7. Qf3+ Ke6 {hard to believe: but this is the best reply...} 8. Nc3 {persisting...} Ncb4 {a pity: best was Nce7: Black is trying to capitalize on pawn c2...} 9. O-O Qf6 {a very bad idea...} 10. Bxd5+ Nxd5 11. Qxd5+ {Black resigned...}
