1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. g3 {I chose to play the Reti Opening for this game. I like it because it is a subtle aggression. Instead of attempting to blast the center with a 3 or 4 pawn attack White delays multiple pawn pushes and indirectly controls the center mostly with pieces (knights to c3 & f3, a fianchettoed LSB and later developing the DSB). Pawn to c4 is an exception as it is meant to be played early, then later d4 or d3. White usually gains a slight positional advantage.} Bf5 4. Bg2 e6 {Though I don't think this is a particularly bad move, it does close off most avenues of escape for the bishop. I will talk more about some options later.} 5. O-O c6 6. Qb3 Qc7 7. d4 Nbd7 8. Nc3 Be7 9. Nh4 {I wanted to take your bishop with my knight for two reasons:  1. Knights are the stronger piece in cramped, closed positions, while bishops are stronger in open positions. You have to consider each game individually, but generally, pieces get traded off and closed positions in the opening, become open positions in the middle game and end game. So, although both pieces are technically the same value, the bishops are my piece of choice.  2. Since the bishop had no place to escape to, and no other pieces could defend the bishop, you would have to take back with a pawn, thus messing up your pawn structure.} g6 {(???) This move ensures that you will have doubled pawns with no compensation. You could have played 9. ... Bg6. That way, when I play 10. NxB (and I would), you could respond with 10. ... hg. This would be better for 4 reasons: 1. You would have an open file to my king with a rook already positioned on the file. 2. The doubled pawns would be closer to the edge of the board therefore they are not as important as the center pawns. 3. The move you made prevents you from playing e5, without further damaging your pawn structure. If later you play e5, I will take with my d-pawn, and you take back with a piece. That would leave you with 2 "isolated" doubled pawns. Isolated doubled pawns are even worse than doubled pawns because they can't protect each other at all. Before the pawn exchange, you would have a pawn on f7, e6 and f5. So the f7 pawn protects the e6 pawn which protects the one on f5.  4. The doubled pawn structure on f7, g7 and g8 would be harder for me to take advantage of.} 10. Nxf5 gxf5 11. Bf4 Bd6 12. Bxd6 Qxd6 13. cxd5 {I took one pawn here. Then you moved your knight to protect the b-pawn and I get to take a 2nd pawn. A 2 for 1 Sale! Woohoo!} Nb6 14. dxc6 {In the end Satya, I'd say you have several options on how to handle this in the future. None of them are so much better or worse than each other, but more a matter of personal style. Option 1: Don't let your bishop get trapped! Before blocking your bishop in with e6 (or d6; or if your playing white, e3 or d3) move your rook pawn forward one square to enable the bishop a retreat square. If you are like me, you prefer your bishops, so this may be best. Option 2: When the knight attacks the bishop, move the bishop back to be defended by the rook-pawn. Then when your opponent takes it, you take back with the rook-pawn, opening a file to attack with. Then maybe queenside castle. Option 3: Set up your position so that you have another piece ready and able to capture back. See our current game with you playing white for example. We have almost the same scenario, except that you have the option to move your queen knight to e7, defending the bishop. Option 4: Move the bishop! You had the g4 square available!}
