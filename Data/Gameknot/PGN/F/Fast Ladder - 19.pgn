1. g3 {I usually play unusual openings in ladder games, for the same reason I construct themed minis of offbeat openings. It does get boring to play your 50th Ruy Lopez in 3 months.} e5 2. Bg2 {Finish what you start! Must complete the fianchetto.} c6 3. d3 {To guard the K4 square.} Nf6 4. Nf3 {Now Black can't drive this Knight with P-K5.} Bd6 5. Nc3 {No need to castle yet, since the game hasn't gotten tactical at once.} a5 6. a4 {Putting a stop to any immediate Q-side ambitions Black may have.} Bb4 7. Bd2 {Unpinning.} d6 8. O-O {Completing development.} Bxc3 9. Bxc3 {No reason to double the Pawns.} Nbd7 10. e4 {Seizing my share of the center.} h6 11. Qd2 {Connecting the Rooks.} Nc5 12. b3 {The best way to defend a Pawn is with another Pawn, in most cases.} Bg4 13. h3 {"Putting the question".} Bxf3 14. Bxf3 {Completing the exchange.} b5 15. Bg2 {Preparing to seize K-side space.} bxa4 16. bxa4 {Have to complete this exchange first.} Ncd7 17. f4 {Now I look to open some lines.} exf4 18. Qxf4 {I figure Black will eventually castle on the K side, so I may as well start an attack there.} d5 19. Bxf6 {Clearing away one defender.} Nxf6 20. Rab1 {Can't completely ignore the Q side, so I seize an open file. All my other pieces will focus on the K side.} O-O 21. g4 {Looking to sweep forward with the Pawns.} dxe4 22. Bxe4 {Now the B is activated. Black had a chance to trade it off but did not, an error that would come back to haunt him.} Qd7 23. Bf5 {Moving out of the Knight's fire with tempo.} Qa7+ 24. Kh1 {Black isn't going to go down meekly. He intends a counterattack.} Nd5 25. Qd6 {Ducking clear.} Qe3 26. Qh2 {I have to also defend.} Rfe8 27. Be4 {Cutting the link on the file.} Nc3 28. Rbe1 {Counterattacking the Q in an attempt to regain the initiative.} Qd4 29. Qg2 {Threatening to fork the Rooks with BxP.} Rec8 30. Bxc6 {I win a Pawn in any case.} Ra6 31. Qf3 {Focusing on Black's vulnerable K position.} Rc7 32. Be8 {Here we go...} Nxa4 33. Bxf7+ {Looking to close the net.} Kh7 34. Be8 {Now I just have to get my Pawn to cover the potential attack square at Black's KN3.} Nb2 35. h4 {On the move...} a4 36. h5 {Mission accomplished.} Rf6 37. Qg3 {Ducking clear.} Rxc2 38. Bg6+ {If Black plays ...RxB, he loses the Exchange. If he moves his King...} Kg8 39. Re8+ {I have...} Rf8 40. Rexf8# {...an immediate mate.}
