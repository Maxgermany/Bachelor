1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {out of an Italian setup the Two Knights Defense, also one of my all time favorites to battle against... always very sharp play...} 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Na5 {an often recommended sideline, which is as good as refuted...} 6. Bb5+ c6 7. dxc6 bxc6 8. Qf3 {the Blackburne Variation, with after cxb5?, Qxa8; this variation is largely responsible for the extinction of this system with Na5... in stead, modern theory continues with Nxd5, d4, Be7, Nxf7 (Fischers' recommendation) or Nxd5, Qh5, g6, Qf3... my personal favorite is Nxd5, Nxf7, Kxf7, Qf3+, Ke6, Nc3, with all kinds of complications...} Qc7 9. Bd3 {I prefer this over the Steinitz move Be2, also recommended by Kasparov; too intricate play for me... trick here is, both players lose tempo, but white gains more back... Na5 is clearly displaced...} h6 10. Ne4 Be7 {probably better Nd5 at this stage, and maybe even Nf4 or Nb4 after that to exchange Bd3 while we still can......} 11. Nxf6+ Bxf6 12. Nc3 Bb7 13. O-O c5 14. Be4 Be7 {unclear what made black do this... best is Nc6, Nd5, Qd6, Nxf6+, Qxf6...} 15. d3 Bxe4 16. Qxe4 O-O {also here, Nc6 was to be prefered; black is entering a whole new world of pain...} 17. f4 {it took me too long to figure out if Nd5, Qd7, f4 (or Nxe7+, Qxe7,f4) was stronger... so straight away f4; exf4 is of course met with Bxf4......} Nc6 18. Nd5 {I liked this better than releasing the tension with fxe5...} Qd6 {and the bluff worked; black had better in to move on with Qd7, since e5 is lost in all variations after fxe5, Nxe5, Bf4, f6, Rae1... after Qd7 however white gets to play f5, with possible mayhem on f6... Qd6 holds the crosspin over e5 intact...} 19. fxe5 {the right time to take on e5: Nxe5 is met with Bf4, f6, Rae1...} Nxe5 20. Bf4 f6 21. Rfe1 {the only way to go, for both black and white... (note: here, I meant to have played Rae1)} Rae8 {I would have chosen Rad8, c4, Qd7... black is locking in Rf8 now... this might open possibilities... (note: here, I meant he played Rfe8; even stating, he was locking in Rf8; very strange what happened here)} 22. b4 {first of all, cxb4? leads to serious problems after d4... and after bxc5, Qxc5+, d4!, f5, dxc5, fxe4, we have a good way to swap Queens... we need some leverage on f6-f5, so we drive the black Queen out of the way from Ne5...} Bd8 23. a4 {white holds on to bxc5 just a little bit longer... in fact forcing black, to take on b4; else maybe b5...} Qe6 24. Bxe5 Qxe5 {up until now, there was not much wrong with whites' play; after Qxe5, fxe5, bxc5, white is clearly better... but something went very wrong during move 21...} 25. Nxf6+ {for some reason, in whites' mind, his annotations and analysis, he had played and annotated 21. Rae1, and black had played Rfe8; as we can see, that clearly was not the case... whatever happened, in whites' perception, notations, demonstration board and all, Ra1 was in fact on f1, and Rf8 in fact on a8... a very rare case of chess blindness, where the mind prevails over game reality; wishfull thinking? we might never know... in short: with no rook on f1, and a rook on f8, Nxf6+, is nothing less than a losing blunder... Qxf6 was not possible with a rook on f1, and after gxf6 white is winning... now, white might be losing...} Qxf6 {these are the breaks...} 26. Qd5+ {Qxe8, Rxe8, Rxe8+, Kh7, can never solve this... we need the Queen...} Kh7 27. Ref1 Qd4+ 28. Qxd4 cxd4 29. Rxf8 Rxf8 30. a5 Be7 31. b5 Rb8 32. Rb1 Bd8 33. b6 axb6 34. a6 Ra8 35. Ra1 Kg6 36. Ra4 Bf6 37. Kf2 Kf5 38. Kf3 Ke6 39. Ke4 Kd6 40. g4 b5 41. Ra2 Kc5 42. a7 Kb6 43. h4 Rxa7 44. Rxa7 Kxa7 45. h5 Kb6 46. Kd5 Ka5 {it is over... white will lose both Q-side pawns to blacks' b-pawn, and then the d-pawn will march... } 47. Kc5 Ka4 {white is out of moves... resigned...}
