[Opening "QGD Slav defence, Alekhine variation (D10)"]

1. d4 {The opponent is about 400 rating points stronger than me, but I play the same opening against all players. My choice is d4.} d5 2. c4 c6 {Black plays the Slav Defence.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bf4 {I usually play this move instead of the more common 5. e3 or 5. Bg5. This way I can avoid most opening preparations by stronger players and get a playable position.} dxc4 {Black accepts the gambit pawn.} 6. a4 {This is almost an automatic reaction. Otherwise Black consolidates the position with b5.} Bb4 {Black wants to keep to c4-pawn while developing a piece. The knight is pinned so b5 works again.} 7. e3 {The light-squared bishop needs to get out. Perhaps g3 was another option, because placing the bishop on the long diagonal makes sense after the eventual b5 by Black.} Nd5 {Black wants to take advantage of the unusually bishop position. Now I must protect c3 once more.} 8. Qc2 Nxf4 {And Black takes the bishop. After this Black has the bishop pair an a better pawn structure, I think.} 9. exf4 b5 {Now the c4 pawn is secure.} 10. g3 {The light-squared bishop has no future on this diagonal so it will go to g2.} O-O 11. Bg2 Bb7 {And Black plays his bishop on the same diagonal to oppose mine.} 12. O-O a6 {This is a typical pawn formation for Black in the Slav Defence. After a6 comes to protect b5, the c6 pawn is ready for the central break move c5.} 13. Rfd1 {Activating the rook. It seemed that the d4 pawn required extra protection, if I am to move my knight from f3.} Nd7 {A good temporary square for the knight. From here it can go to f6 or in some variations to c5 or e5.} 14. Ne5 {I try to play actively. Otherwise I am lost, because I have one pawn less.} Qc7 {Black simply protects the c6 pawn one more time and connects the rooks.} 15. Ne4 {Activating the other knight. I can already see a potential outpost at d6.} Nxe5 {And Black exchanges. This goes according to my plans.} 16. dxe5 {16. fxe5 was an alternative, but the pawn on d4 seemed too weak to me then. Now the supported outpost at d6 is ready. Only the b4-bishop covers it.} Rad8 {Moving rooks to open files is usually good.} 17. b3 {I want to break Black's pawn mass. 17...c3 is not possible, because it loses a pawn, so Black must react in another way.} cxb3 {Now the annoying pawn is gone.} 18. Qxb3 Rxd1+ {Black gets rid of one pair of rooks. However, the open file is mine again, at least temporarily.} 19. Rxd1 {I am still threatening the b4-bishop, so Black must do something about it.} c5 {So he protects it with the c-pawn. Fortunately, this blocks the bishop's path to d6.} 20. Nd6 {And there it is! The knight's position is beautiful. I can already vision all kinds of tactics related to the f7-square.} Bxg2 {Black exchanges the bishops. This is fine with me.} 21. Kxg2 Qc6+ {This check covers the b5-square which was threatened twice but protected only once.} 22. f3 {I thought about 22. Kg1 first, but then this seemed like a better move, because it gave me the e4-square and the possibility to advance the king after the g- and h-pawns move forward.} bxa4 {Takes a pawn and breaks the pawn island. It is more difficult to advance the isolated pawns without the help of other pieces. Meanwhile, I will try to do some damage on the king side.} 23. Qc4 {I was pondering between this move and 23. Qa2. The more central position of the queen and the possibility to move to the king side made me choose this way.} h5 {Ok. Black does not want to stand still on the king side either.} 24. h3 {Preparing g4. Perhaps direct 23. f5 would have given me an opportunity to fight for a draw. For example 23. f5 exf5 24. Nxf7+!? Qb5 (24...Rxf7 25. Rd8+ Kh7 26. Qxf7 and White wins) 25. Nd6+ Qxc4 26. Nxc4 a3 27. f4 a5 28. Ra1 a4 29. Nxa3 Ra8 30. Nc4 and I am still fighting.} Rb8 {Black moves the rook away from protecting the f7-pawn. I change my plan and try take advantage of it immediately.} 25. f5 {No g4 needed anymore, because Black cannot take with 25...exf5, and after 26. Qxf7+ I have at least a perpetual check.} Ba5 {But unfortunately, it is too late. Now the rook threatens to penetrate my position.} 26. Qa2 {I try to keep the queen on the a2-g8 diagonal while protecting the second rank.} Rb3 {However, the third rank is now weak.} 27. Rf1 {Protecting f3 temporarily.} Bc3 {And now I am lost.} 28. Qe2 {This is a blunder, but I lost already earlier.} Rb2 {And I resign. A summary of the game: The opening was a kind of Slav Defence where Black took on c4 and kept the pawn. I was worse for the most of the game, although Black's advantage was barely winning until the very end. I missed my chance to complicate the game by 24. f5 and 25. Nxf7. After that it was almost impossible to prevent Black from utilizing the b-file and the weak position of the king.}
