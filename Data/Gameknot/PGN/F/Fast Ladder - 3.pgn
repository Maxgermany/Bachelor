1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 e6 3. d3 Nc6 4. c3 Nf6 5. Be3 d5 {Fairly standard high percentage opening to this point. I am attempting to push back white bishops and assert central control at this point.} 6. exd5 exd5 7. Bb3 {Strong central pawn position established with white interestingly backing off with bishop not advancing to pin knight.} Bd6 8. Nf3 h6 9. Nbd2 O-O {White has developed all pieces, black has 3 out and central pawn control and castled kingside. Solid textbook start for both. } 10. d4 {White looks to break up my central pawn position, declined.} c4 11. Bc2 Re8 12. O-O a6 13. b3 {Second attempt by white to disrupt pawn structure, again declined} b5 14. Nh4 {This is an interesting aggressive move from white to open up an attacking line against the black kingside} Qc7 {Responding with an aggressive cross board attack on white kingside} 15. Ndf3 Bg4 {Looking to undermine the white defence of kingside by pinning knight} 16. Qd2 {White responds and setups cross board attack of his own which was a surprising development} a5 {Continued aggressive pawn development, possible stalling move to force white to act in their attack against my set defence} 17. Bxh6 {Aggressive attack with white gambit bishop into my kingside expecting gxh6, 18. Qxh6 opening up entire black kingside and multiple knights to leap forward to press the attack} Ne4 {Declined the gambit and instead pressured the white queen} 18. Qe3 Kh7 {Slotted King into position to ensure full material capture if white doesn't withdraw from line of attack} 19. Bxe4+ {I didn't appreciate the attack that was happening here, missing the subsequent fork check, resulting in losing the exchange. My eyes on the h file pawn and the pressure on the white queen to try and capture the gambit bishop were the focus. } Rxe4 20. Ng5+ Kg8 21. Nxe4 dxe4 22. Bg5 Bxh2+ 23. Kh1 Bd6 {White looks in a strong material position consolidating the exchange by pulling back his exposed bishop. } 24. Qxe4 Bd7 {I reset my position into a defensive line looking to control the open e file.} 25. bxc4 bxc4 26. Nf3 Re8 27. Qh4 {This move and the white queen's position on the open h file became an obsession both on the defensive and the offensive opportunities. } Be7 28. Bxe7 Nxe7 29. g4 Ng6 30. Qh5 Bc6 31. d5 {a much more open board now developed with the possibility of a knock out blow being landed by either player. } Bb7 32. Rad1 Rd8 33. Ng5 Bxd5+ {A saw the opening to force pressure on the white king} 34. f3 a4 {a stalling move to force white to budge from the position. } 35. Rdb1 Qc6 36. Rbe1 Qb6 37. Qh2 Bb7 38. Re2 Bc6 39. Rb2 Qa7 40. Qe2 Rd3 {aggressive move to try and force open white pawns} 41. Rfb1 {there was real risk of checkmate in the back court now} Rxc3 {but still decided to take the white pawn} 42. Rb2b8+ Nf8 43. Qh2 {checkmate being threatened } Bxf3+ 44. Nxf3 Rxf3 {saved checkmate and won another pawn, materially back level, but knight & pawns against connected rooks. } 45. Re1 Rh3 {decided the only way to deal with the threatened back file checkmate was to remove material from the board.} 46. Qxh3 Qxb8 47. Rf1 Qb2 48. Qh5 {White going on the offensive again trying looked worrying. } Ng6 49. Qd5 Ne5 {very risky defence of the f pawn} 50. g5 Qe2 51. Qg2 Qxg2+ {gratefully accepted removing material from the board} 52. Kxg2 Kf8 53. Rf5 Ng4 54. Rc5 Ke7 55. Rxc4 {hung out the pawn and was very surprised that black took the bait} Ne3+ 56. Kf3 Nxc4 {for the first time in the game, materially ahead and able to create a scenario where white could no longer win the game} 57. Ke4 Ke6 58. Kd4 Nd6 59. Kc5 Ne4+ 60. Kb5 Nc3+ 61. Kb4 Nxa2+ 62. Kxa4 Kf5 63. Kb3 Nc1+ 64. Kc2 Kxg5 {decided to just eliminate all white material and begin the actual job of winning the game which required the queening of the pawn, not the knight. Though in fairness, surprised this game wasn't resigned on the fork check.} 65. Kxc1 Kf4 66. Kd1 g5 67. Ke1 Kf3 68. Kf1 g4 69. Kg1 g3 70. Kf1 g2+ 71. Kg1 f5 72. Kh2 Kf2 73. Kh3 g1=Q 74. Kh4 Qg4# {}
