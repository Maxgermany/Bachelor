1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 Qh4+ 4. Kf1 {I know White wins more from this position but I wanted to try a defense to see what he would do.} Nf6 5. Nf3 Qh6 6. Nc3 c6 {I debated here. I thought this move might be better than either Bb4 or d5.} 7. Ne5 d5 8. exd5 Bd6 9. d4 {I missed the impact of this move. It holds the central tension and begins the pressure on the advanced f pawn.} O-O 10. Qf3 Nh5 {Was not sure what to do here. } 11. Be2 {Simple and effective. } Ng3+ {Hoping the complications might give Black opportunties.} 12. Qxg3 fxg3 13. Bxh6 gxh6 14. Nc4 Bf4 15. hxg3 Bxg3 {Black is trying to preserve equality, but White's edge in development is too hard to meet.} 16. Rxh6 Bf5 17. Nd6 {A nice move with multiple threats.} Bxc2 18. Nxb7 cxd5 19. Rh3 {Black loses at least a pawn and still is behind in development. Resignation was in order.}
