1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 c5 6. Bg5 {This internal league game between Gertjan Van der Hoeven and Rob Witt was played at the Dutch Club, Caissa, and was sent to me recently in relation to the opening. Some of the club's players are familiar with and have tested the opening in club matches. This particular one is a feast of tactical devices and is well worth studying. With the exception of the analysis to White's 16th move, the notes are extracted from the game's annotation by Rob Witt. } Qb6 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O Bxf2 10. Na4 Qb4 11. Qxf2 Qxa4 12. a3 O-O 13. Qg3 f5 14. exf6 e.p. Nxf6 15. Bd3 {The position is known to theory - although White's 12th move [12.a3] is not his only option and is not necessarily best.} Bd7 {A natural enough move; but in fact it is incorrect. As Rob Witt points out; also not so hot for Black is 15...Qg4 [trying to simplify with the trade of queens] 16.Bxh7+ Kxh7 17.Bxf6 Qxg3 18.hxg3+ and White is quite happy with the resulting position.  Best is 15...Ne4! } 16. Rdf1 {This is also a mistake - although the intention is good. I believe White has an excellent move here in the unlikely-looking 16.c4! But why on earth this move - which only seems to open up White's own king position and attract ideas of ...Rac8 for Black? The answer is partly based upon the observation that if Black captures the pawn on c4 then his queen will be cut off from the fourth rank and king-side. The other part of the answer is the tactical proof: Thus, for example, after 16.c4 dxc4? 17.Bxf6 Rxf6 18.Bc2 and Black is suddenly lost.  Similarly, 16.c4 rules out 16...Ne4? which now fails for tactical reasons because the bishop on d7 is unprotected after 17.Bxe4 dxe4 18.Rxd7 and there is no time for to take the f3 knight because of mating threats against g7. Meanwhile, 18...Qxc4 is no more than a spite check in a lost position. Finally, 16...Rac8 Ng5 leads to some very interesting possibilities. Preliminary analysis suggests that after 16.c4!? Rf7 may in fact be the best answer - but still leads to a sustained attack by White.} Ne4 {A good move. Black is a pawn up and welcomes any dilution of White's fire-power.} 17. Qh4 {Relying on the fact that the knight is pinned to the queen. But it is another slight error: As Witt points out in his game notes; relatively best here was 17.Bxe4 Qxe4 - although this would leave black quite happy with the position. But in fact Black has an excellent move here which he pointed out after the game: 17...Nb4! After 18.Kb1 Nxd3 19.cxd3 Rxf3! leads to major simplifications when Black should win.} e5 {Thematically correct but clearly not as good as 17...Nb4} 18. Nd2 {Having made a couple of mistakes, White begins to find some great moves. This is what often happens when a player is 'let off the hook'.} h6 {Must be played. Witt confirms that 18...Bf5 fails to 19.Rxf5 Rxf5 20.Nxe4 dxe4 21.Bxe4 with two massive threats; against h7 and a discovery against the queen on a4.} 19. Nxe4 {Again - Black needs to watch his queen: If 19...hxg5?? 20.Nf6 and 'goodbye' to the queen.} dxe4 20. Bxe4 Nd4 {Blow for blow. Not only does this stop the discovered attacks on Black's queen; but it leaves the c-file half open and even sets up possibilities arising out of ...Ne2+ and ...Nc3+ - splitting the pawn shell in front of the White king. Not bad for a single move. } 21. Bxh6 {Not to be outdone - White presses on regardless with his own threats.} Rxf1+ {In an excellent annotation, Witt points out that 21...Ne2+ is not a 'real' threat: It should be answered by 22.Kd1! when after 22...Nf4!? 23.Rxf4 Qd4+ 24.Kc1 exf4 looks about equal. } 22. Rxf1 Qa6 {The queen finally gets the breathing space to get back to help the king-side. It seems that after 23.Bd5+ Be6 easily defends. But matters are not so clear 24.Rf6! Qe2 [only move] 25.Bxe6 Nxe6 26.Rxe6 Rc8 27.Kb1 Qd1+! 28.Bc1 Qxc2+ 29.Ka2 Qf5! =} 23. Bh7+ {This is the alternative to the check on d5} Kxh7 24. Bxg7+ Kxg7 25. Qe7+ Kg6 26. Qf7+ Kg5 27. Qg7+ {At this point black is two pieces up but White has the initiative. It is very unfortunate that Black is just about to make a terrible blunder. He explains that it was not even an impulsive move; but played after a few minutes thought - a complete 'black-out'.  Under normal circumstances, Black would have played the forced 27...Qg6 and after 28.Qxe5+ there are two possible continuations: [A] 28...Bf5 [probably weakest] although after 29.Qxd4 Kh6 matters are still unclear because of White's many pawns. [B] 28...Nf5 [best I think] 29.g4 Qa6!? [Fritz] and who can be sure how this game would have ended. } Kh5 {[??] An unfortunate conclusion to a great game - but who hasn't ever made such a blunder?} 28. Rf6 {Black resigns.  Nominally speaking, he has sufficient material for the queen. But his luck has entirely deserted him: Having just made a terrible blunder he then also finds that his pieces are too scattered to survive in this position.}
