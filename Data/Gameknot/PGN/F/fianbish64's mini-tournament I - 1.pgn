1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3 {?! I believe this is an inaccuracy, because my opinion is that Black is quite happy with the exchanges happening in the game.} Nxe4 5. Bxf7+ {Probably better than the straightforward Nxe4, at least he makes my King a little bit exposed.} Kxf7 6. Nxe4 d5 7. Neg5+ Kg8 8. d3 h6 9. Nh3 Bxh3 {I played this move after a long thought, but in the end I evaluated that my center strike would have come first.} 10. gxh3 e4 11. dxe4 dxe4 12. Nd2 {?} e3 {! Generally I'm a quiet, positional player, but I felt like this move couldn't be bad, and I was really happy to see variation confirmed that. In general, it is usually good to open the enemy King at the cost of a pawn, especially if you can get so many pieces active with gain of some tempi.} 13. fxe3 Qh4+ 14. Kf1 {I don't like this, I believe Ke2 would have been more resistant.} Qxh3+ 15. Kg1 Bc5 {Another piece comes in with gain of a tempo, and defense is quite difficult now.} 16. Qf3 {?? The final mistake, Nc4 or Nf1 would have prolonged the game more.} Bxe3+ {! This final blow nicely closes the game, because White loses his Queen by force.}
