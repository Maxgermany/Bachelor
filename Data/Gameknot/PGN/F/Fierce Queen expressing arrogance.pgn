1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. h4 {this is a first, in my career in the Sicilian...} Bg7 4. d4 e6 5. Be3 Ne7 {no fear for c5: it is just a tempo winning gambit pawn...} 6. Bc4 {not very wise...} d5 7. exd5 exd5 8. Bb3 c4 9. Ba4+ Bd7 10. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {all forced: Qxd7 is stronger than Nxd7...} 11. Nc3 O-O 12. Qd2 a6 {we can throw in the Najdorf extension, anywhere we want...} 13. O-O-O {castling clearly into trouble...} b5 14. a3 {not good enough...} Nf5 {creating more trouble...} 15. Bf4 Nc6 {relentless: the last developing piece is coming into play...} 16. g4 Nfxd4 {why not?} 17. Kb1 {and White resigned on the spot: not sure why; probably, Nf3 is suddenly a big issue...}
