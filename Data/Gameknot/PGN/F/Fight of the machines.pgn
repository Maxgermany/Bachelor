1. e4 {simple move, yet b&w are at a quite equal stage of development.} g6 {titi chose the modern defense. there is not much theory written about it yet. to be honest, i don´t really care if there is. wurscht.} 2. Nf3 {standard development, played very often in the db. nearly 9 times more 2.d4 is played, what is called norwegian defense.} Bg7 3. Nc3 {fritzi bets on developing his knights first. i would do so as well. der figurentausch BxN PxN would double white´s pawns but that wouldn´t matter because white had a better development and a center-pawn.} Nc6 4. d4 {occupying the center and threatening 5.d5.} d6 {first i wondered why not d5 but a second later i realized why not. i think it is not necessary to explain.} 5. d5 Ne5 6. Nxe5 Bxe5 {this situation appears in the db only 2 times: win/loss rate: 50/50 but Fritz calculates a little advantage for himself.} 7. Qd3 e6 8. dxe6 fxe6 {? a open f-file is ever good for your king´s defense. also it blocks the 2nd bishop´s diagonal. (at least i think so. if somebody disagree feel free to add a comment.)} 9. Be2 Bd7 10. f4 {! sending his bishop back where he´s coming from. } Bg7 11. Be3 {preparing for the long rochade (castling), what brings his queen´s rook in. and gives white a strong pair of bishops, which hold their position up to the 19th move.} Nf6 {also wants to castle. whithout the pawns on f7 and g7 i would have decided for the long castling. } 12. O-O-O O-O {also good may have been 12...Bc6 what threatens g2 after 13.e5 dxe5 14.fxe5 Nd5 15.Nxd5 B(or Q)xd5 or, if not 15.Nxd5 threatens changing on e3. 12...d5, good as well. everything better than what is happening now:} 13. e5 dxe5 14. fxe5 Nd5 15. Nxd5 exd5 {the much better variation for white because of:} 16. Qxd5+ {!} Kh8 {forced? with Rf7 he could protect but then follows 17.Rhf1.} 17. Qxd7 {winning material.} Qxd7 18. Rxd7 Bxe5 {you dont have to be a GM to predict who is about to win.} 19. Bf3 {attacking b7} Bf4 {not bad, but he forgot that after the exchange there is still the attack on b7 AND c7 is uncovered...} 20. Bxf4 Rxf4 21. Rhd1 Rb8 22. Rxc7 Rh4 23. Bxb7 Rf8 24. h3 a5 25. Rdd7 {! ties the rook to the h-file because 25....Ra4 26.Rh7  Kg8 Bd5  . this will be very important later on.} Rf1+ {so what? after that he will have to go back to f8 in order to avoid checkmate.that just loses a tempo and helps the king coming out of his hole.} 26. Kd2 Rf8 27. a3 a4 28. Bc6 {attacking a4 is not bad cause the rook, as we know, can´t get away from his h.} Re8 {uuh, i bet that made Fritz very scared..} 29. c4 {! still remember what i said about his h-rook?} Rb8 30. Ke3 {!great. the b8 Rook is only able to leave his 8th reihe giving check, and then has to return again. so he cannot kill b2 and cannot prevent the king attacking.} Rb3+ 31. Kf2 Rb8 32. Bxa4 Rf8+ {now, there is a chance to take on b2 but this would lose a rook - or the game.} 33. Kg3 Rh5 34. b4 Rg5+ 35. Kh2 Rh5 36. b5 {! fritz calculates a mate in 16 or something (can´t remember how much, maybe 11 or 18..) but it went faster.} Kg8 {ähä.. why not g5?} 37. b6 {!} Kh8 {why not g5?} 38. b7 {!} Kg8 {why not g5?} 39. c5 {!} g5 {es hätt eh vorher auch nix gebracht. trotzdem hatter drei tempos verbraucht mit denen er das matt vl ein paar züge rauszögern hätte können.} 40. Rc8 Re8 {technically resigned.} 41. Rxe8# {Fritz turned out to be better than Chess Titans on his highest level, quod erat demonstrandum. Some of you might say that i, as a low rated amateur player, shouldn't annotate highly theoretical openings i never played before but i just had nothing better to do today (besides learning for the exam tomorrow..) than let two programs fight like a little boy letting fight his toy-soldiers against each other. and i wanted you to participate on this historical event: maschine versus maschine!}
