[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C64), classical (Cordel) defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Typical Ruy Lopez opening } Bc5 {I use Morphy's Defence.} 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5 Qd4 {I like this Defence, it allows me to advance many lines and attack while making white move Ke5 for a 2nd time in a row allowing me to gain momentum in the early going. } 6. Nd3 {For example, now I recoup my lost pawn} Qxe4+ 7. Qe2 {He blocks with the queen to allow his King to still have the possibility to castle } Qxe2+ {I now take that away, he must move his king now. My opponent now cannot castle, has no queen and is closed in on his bishop lines. I feel I am well enough ahead to sacrifice my queen for his.} 8. Kxe2 b6 {If I had to do it over again I would simply move the bishop, this causes me much trouble in a few moves.} 9. Nxc5 {He takes, and I must recapture} bxc5 {Now my lack of foresight has caused me to have the dreaded three pawn tier. My opponent is still blocked in but I am in an awkward position.} 10. Re1 {My opponent seeking to put his king to bed the hard way.} Be6 11. Kf1 {He is successful. My once apparent lead in position is now almost lost.} Nf6 12. b3 O-O {I now am safely out of sight and I see that My opponent has his sights on my totem of Pawns. } 13. Ba3 {Expected} Nd7 {I must now spend my resources and time to protect dead pawns, drat not thinking ahead earlier!} 14. c4 Rfe8 {If I am going to do anything this game I must now involve my rooks. I have my eye's on h2 and g2 as possible attack points. Lets see how this pans out.} 15. Nc3 {My opponent is spending a lot of time trying to break down my useless wall. If I were him I would focus my attention on King side and forget those pawns, they aren't in the picture now, and with the move of c4 I can't advance them any further.   With Nc3 he leaves d2 undefended, I now have a 3rd option of attack. Of course Ne4 fixes that. Lets see.} Rad8 {I ready my attack...} 16. Na4 {Hmm... He really wants those pawns} a5 {...Honesty I don't remember what my thinking was here, I know I lost a move though. Nf6 or Nb6 would've been a better option. The only thing I can think is a Combo of Na4xc5 Nd7xc5 Ba3xc5 would allow a Bc5xa7, but I would've had time to move a7; So I don't know. I just missed it.  ?? } 17. Nxc5 {Expected} Nxc5 18. Bxc5 Rxd2 {I have again pulled even with points. I don't like my pawn structure compared with Whites.} 19. Be3 {White now starts a series of moves to attack my little fledgling a5 pawn} Rd3 20. Bf4 Re7 21. Re5 {I'm not sure what white is doing, it seems that my opponent is wainting for me to make a mistake. He is losing a lot of time focusing on my pawns without really improving his position.} a4 22. Ra5 {He would love a4xb3 this would allow a2xb3 and pair his rooks up on my flank with almost certain checkmate} h6 {So I give myself a back door and consign a4 to the wolves} 23. Rxa4 {At this point, I feel good about my position. My opponent seems content chasing down wayward pawns and is allowing me to hold the coveted middle ground.} Bg4 {So I start to make my play. I line up to take the middle by force.} 24. h3 {My opponent is thinking that exact same thing...} Bxh3 {So I gambit. I do not wish to push him back into his little hole, I want to flush him out. And maybe get a rook to boot if Bonnernose isn't careful.} 25. gxh3 Rxh3 {Here is the moment I am pushing for, I want whites king to stay on f1 to pin it to a1 Rook. Lets see...} 26. Kg2 {Ouch! He does see it} Rh4 {Ok well I can't get the prize, lets push him around a little} 27. Kg3 g5 {This little pawn move gave him fits for a while.} 28. Rd1 {He now sees the importance of holding a middle file. I was starting to wonder.} h5 {I was hoping for a Bf4xg5, this would allow me to fork his king and bishop, but} 29. Be3 {To no avail, he again spots my trap. Bonner is a very good reactionary chess player. Very few mistakes.} Rhe4 {I am putting an allusion of pressure on Be4, hoping he takes g4} 30. Kf3 {but again he thwarts my efforts to trick him into handing me a free bishop.} g4+ {I am down 2 points, but I have the upper hand in position due to flushing out his king earlier.} 31. Ke2 {Kg2 would have been a better option for white.} f5 32. Rh1 {Again white is focusing on pawns instead of notices the threat to his bishop.} f4 {Finally I have a victory of sorts. Maybe white forgot that I coveted his Dark bishop. I am a little more open that what I would like, but I feel confident in my position.} 33. Rxh5 {White now has in roads into my defences, but at a cost.} fxe3 34. fxe3 Re4xe3+ {We're even again in points and I have a double barrel shot gun locked and loaded, my opponent is working with a .22 rifle. Lets see which is stronger.} 35. Kf2 Rf3+ {enter said pawn that will cause much frustration to my opponent. I love well placed pawns. (Not like those two losers on c7 & c6 haha lol} 36. Kg2 Re2+ {Firing on all cylinders here, I have to focus white does have me in a little of a jam if I give him a little opening.} 37. Kg1 g3 {I considered checking again but felt that advancing my pawn was paramount for finishing strong.} 38. Ra8+ {Here we go, lets hope my rish assessment was accurate.} Kf7 39. Rg5 {Again ??? I would have thought pursuing my king till death would have been more pressing than that pawn. I'm Wide open, at least a 2nd check could have gotten whites rooks in better postion to defend the king. White has something for my pawns, I know it...lol} Rc3 {I'm am all ready to put the last nail in the coffin. } 40. Rf5+ {Now he breaks off his pursuit of my viscious pawn and attacks the poor little king sitting in the middle of nowhere. } Kg6 {Always attack when defending! } 41. Rf1 {Good move, I now have to pry him out with a crow bar!} Kh5 {So here I go!} 42. Rg8 {Don't tell me, it's the pawn again!!!} Kh4 43. Rd1 {Oh this could be bad... For either of us. Must be careful.} Kh3 {Lets play hide N seek} 44. Rh8+ {expected} Kg4 45. Kf1 {The Begining of the End. I now get to move Re2 into better position without wasting a move. Not a good move for white, doesn't accomplish anything for whites postion. Only a surface attack on e2, nothing serious.} Rf2+ 46. Kg1 {e1 would have been mate, g1 only option, thus f1 was a wasted move} Kf3 {I need to put some pressure on d1} 47. Rf8+ {I wasn't going to stay on f3 anyway, this allows me to move my king without looking like I wanted to.} Ke2 {I am very happy with the next set of moves, It determines the outcome. Rf8xf2 should never be considered.} 48. Rxf2+ {Yet that is what white does.} gxf2+ {I guess he forgot that it would put him in check while I was attacking d1} 49. Kg2 Kxd1 {My opponents one major mistake of the game. } 50. Kxf2 {a4 would have been a stronger move. this would have given white a fighting chance to progress a pawn.} Rc2+ {Now I just split white king and a2 pawn} 51. Ke3 Rxa2 52. Kd4 Kd2 {For the end game I must bring in the King.} 53. Kc5 Ra6 {I do not want to let his pawns get too far, so I need to finish this before it gets outa control} 54. b4 {White is trying to pin himself in, I must watch for the stalemate} Rb6 {I give him one option with the King, d4 or advance b4 pawn} 55. b5 cxb5 56. cxb5 {White wants to stay close to b5, so I must force him to leave} Kc3 {d5 only option} 57. Kd5 {I can't allow him come down to take c7 So i will advance my brave King} Kb4 {My opponent finally admits defeat. He is strong and resilient I am sorry he didn't make me hunt him down.}
