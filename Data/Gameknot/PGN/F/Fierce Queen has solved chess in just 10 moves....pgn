[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 c5 2. f4 g6 3. Nf3 {exactly, how I would have handled the Sicilian as White: from here, I would have preferred g3, Bg2 and 0-0...} Bg7 4. Bc4 {not helping in this opening: as we have seen many times before...} e6 5. O-O Ne7 6. Nc3 a6 {the Najdorf extension, to protect square b5...} 7. a4 {White needs to cover for b7-b5...} O-O 8. d3 d5 {the signature move, in any Sicilian...} 9. Bb3 {safer is exd5, exd5, Ba2: but Black has already piled up too many threats...} d4 {just using force...} 10. Ne2 Nbc6 {in this position, Black had to wait for more than minutes: White timed out; Black had still 4:10 on the clock...}
