1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nf3 {Do not want to get a pawn instead of initiative: 3.c4 c6 4.dxc6 Nxc6} Nxd5 4. d4 Nc6 {Can't say that this is a mistake, but after this move white pawns are invited to go ahead. Black can easily find themselves behind in development. One should pay attention at some other moves: 4...g6, 4...Bg4.} 5. c4 Nb6 6. d5 Nb8 {May be Nb4 is better?} 7. Nc3 g6 {But this seems to be a mistake, because white queen occupies black diagonal and prevents natural development of black pieces. 7...e6 looks better.} 8. Qd4 Rg8 9. Bf4 Bg7 10. Qe3 Nb8d7 {This is an error after which black looses material.} 11. Nb5 Bxb2 {Probably black overlooked that not only rook, but also the queen are in danger} 12. Rb1 Na4 13. Bxc7 Bc3+ 14. Kd1 {}
