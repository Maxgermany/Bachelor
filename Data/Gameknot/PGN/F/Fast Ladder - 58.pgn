Bg5 {Continuing forward} h6 {In the past when retreating my Bishop I've gotten into trouble with a cramped position and once again it happens here. } 7. Bh4 {I retreat} g5 {Pushing me back} 8. Bg3 {Full retreat} Ne4 {Pushing forward with the attack} 9. Qd3 {I thought I could keep my pawns undoubled with this move} Bb7 {Here comes the fianchetto with a great diagonal} 10. d5 {Trying to block things off. This fails.} Nxg3 {Now 11. Qxg3 exd5 12. cxd5 Bxd5 loses a pawn but I probably should have done it anyway as I end up losing the pawn and have the doubled pawns.} 11. hxg3 {Thinking perphaps there will be king side attacks} Na6 {Peeking at Nc5} 12.

Nd2 {Retreat (a common theme in this game for me)} dxe5 {Now takes} 18. dxe5 {Not much else} exd5 {Getting ready to pick up the pawn} 19. f4 {This was one of my few inspired moves. 19. .. dxd4 allows me a fairly nice pawn chain although nets the pawn} gxf3 e.p. {Even with this I get a better pawn structure} 20. gxf3 {Straightening out a bit} Nc5 {Moving the knight to a better position. 21. cxe5 Bxe5 or 21. cxe5 Rxe5 gains more initiative} 21. Rh4 {Trying to get my pieces in the game} dxc4 {Get the rook on an open file.} 22. Rxc4 {22. Nxc4 leads to 22. Bxf3 and my pawns are scattered islands} Ba6 {The pressure is relentless} 23.

Rxe5 {Little hope and I lose one of my doubled pawns for one of his good pawns} Rxe5 {Takes} 34. Rxf7 {Pick up the pawn and my king is in better position although the exchange leaves me with only one rook for defense} Ra5 {Going after my pawns naturally} 35. Kf4 {Now I attempt a desperate charge hoping my e pawn can somehow queen before the queen side avalanche} c5 {The a pawn is easily taken at any time. Move forward} 36. Ke5 {Again getting my king forward} Rxa3 {Bye bye a pawn} 37. Kd6 {37. ... Rxg3 38. Kc7 Rc3 still gives him time to prevent the and I thought might be better} Rd3+ {I want 38. Kc6 threatening back rank mates anyway so this gave me a bit of hope, soon dashed} 38. Kc6 {My first real threat of the game} c4 {Now I snap up some pawns but it is fruitless} 39. Rxa7 {Threatening mate again} Kd8 {Preventing 40. Ra8#} 40. Kxb6 {Snatching another pawn the game is even in material but stopping the c pawn is not an easy task} c3 {There she goes} 41. g4 {I analyzed a number of lines with 41. Rc3 and 41. Ra1 but losing my g pawn ended up with black's h pawn queening everytime} c2 {One step away} 42. Rc7 {I actually thought this prolonged things but the hammer is ready to fall} Rb3+ {Kapow. 43. Ka5 (or Ka6 or Ka7) Kxc7 and 43. Kc6 c1=Q game over. I Resigned rather than forcing a few more routine moves. I felt like I never was in this game at all. }
