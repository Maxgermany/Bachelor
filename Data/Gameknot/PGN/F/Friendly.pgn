1. e3 {This is a game between two friends. I offered to annotate it to try to point out some of the mistakes as I see them.  I am certain any constructive criticism would be welcomed} d5 {Van't Kruijs opening } 2. Nc3 a6 3. Qf3 {It's very early to move the queen. This can help black as he can develop with tempo by attacking the queen as he develops his pieces  Not surpisingly this takes us out of the Gameknot database. It puts pressure directly on the d5 pawn, black has 3 options, d4 which is likely to bring blacks queen out (and so should probably be avoided for the moment). e6 which will block in his lsb and Nf6 which not only defends the pawn but also allows Bg4 which will get whites queen out into the open and mean that black will then be able to gain an advantage in development} Nf6 {Black chooses the sensible development option} 4. b4 {A rather premature pawn rush. This move weakens white, specially in the centre. It also makes it more difficult to castle queens side. this is a problem because the minor pieces on the kings side aren't developed and the only sensible place for the g1 knight at the moment is e2. This needs d4 and Bd3 before it becomes feasible. However even then the white queen is left a little exposed.   The b pawn is undefended and isn't doing much where it is.  In my opinion this loses white the initiative. Better would be d4 or possibly b3,..Bb2 allowing white to castle queenside} c6 {Black has the initiative here but has wasted it a little and even caused problems for himself with this passive move. The d5 pawn doesn't need any more defence, and now the b8 knight has only one option to develop. On the positive side black has opened a small diagonal to a5 for his queen.   Better would have been Nc6 or e5, which pressures the centre where both sides are currently weak on black squares. It also forces white to do something with his b4 pawn which would maintain blacks initiative} 5. Bb2 {The only sensible option for the dsb, however the pawn on b4 is looking a little lonely.  White is now ready to castle and can regain the initiative as black is going to take at least two moves  before he can castle} e5 {This is a good move for black, it lays a claim on the centre and keeps the lines open for both bishops, it also pressures b4 forcing white to react} 6. Qg3 {Threatens the e5 pawn but more importantly pressures g7 which means that black can't take b4 with his bishop or he will lose the ability to castle kings side. This is a problem for black as none of his queen side pieces are developed and when they are, castling on that side would leave the king a little exposed due to the pawn structure.   Black needs to be careful now or white can regain the initiative. An option for black is to finachetto his dsb with g6,...Bg7 but that will delay castling by one move} e4 {Black wants to keep his e pawn but may have overstretched himself in the process and further delayed his development. Qe7, Qc7, or Qd6  were other options. Nd7 would also defend the pawn but would block in blacks lsb completely} 7. Qe5+ {White is going nowhere with this. He really should get his king safe and complete his development first. Whites lsb is a problem now as the only place it can go is e2 blocking in the knight} Be6 {I think black had a better option here of Be7 which allows him to castle next move} 8. Na4 {This is a poor move for white, the knight is now out of harms way on the side of the board, black can be content with that and continue his development. White should have castled or developed his king side which is looking rather sorry for itself.  One of the basic guides in the early game is not to move the same peice twice. White has already done this with his queen and knight. Black has only done it with his e pawn} Nbd7 {Continuing normal development, this is the only place that black can put his knight but it also stops whites threat of Nc5. In addition black develops with tempo as he is attacking the queen} 9. Qg5 {Prevents the black dsb from moving} h6 {Trying to push the queen away though this move weakens the pawn structure on the kings side where black is likely to castle.   Another option would be g6, allowing Bg7 later meaning black could castle  } 10. Qf4 {White could also have considered Bxf6 though that would make castling more problematic. } g5 {Black has weakened his pawn structure further in an attempt to capture the white queen. Castling on the kings side could be troublesome now especially as white's lsb has a nice diagonal to h8} 11. Qg3 {This is a major mistake from white as we will see  Better is Bxf6} Nh5 12. Bxh8 {small consolation for the forthcoming loss of the white queen. This is a direct consequence of white bringing his queen out so early} Nxg3 13. hxg3 {Probably the best pawn to take with. Whites kingside is a little cramped now} Bxb4 {That pawn has been undefended too long to be left alone but this could be a mistake from black as it leaves his h pawn undefended, whites dsb and a rook could put black in trouble} 14. Ne2 {The only sensible place for the knight though whites lsb is now pretty useless  White could also look at Rxh6 opening up attacking possibilies on the black king} b5 {This could be the beginning of a pawn storm by black, though I would be happy to leave the white knight where it is for now if I were black} 15. c3 {Better is Nac4. The c pawn now blocks the white dsb diagonal and makes castling uneccessarily difficult for white} Bf8 16. Nb2 {White has forced himself into this move and the b2 knight has nowhere to go. White is looking very cramped now} f6 {White looks to be in trouble now. His bishops are both useless at the moment, if he castles queenside blacks pawns are threatening and blacks dsb has a good line to b3} 17. Nd4 {Attacks the undefended c pawn and the equally defenceless lsb.} Qe7 {This allows the black queen access to the white king via a3} 18. a4 {Whites options are pretty limited.} c5 19. Nc6 Qh7 {This is a wasted move by black, much better would be Qd6, the bishop is no threat at the moment, the knight is} 20. axb5 {This is a good move by white who can now gain a passed pawn, If black takes the pawn he will lose his rook} Qxh8 {The black queen is now awkwardly placed and it will take a few moves before it will be back in a useful position white is regaining the initiative and black is allowing him to do it} 21. bxa6 {White now has his passed pawn, defended by his rook with a knight available for extra support and an lsb with a nice line in that direction. Black needs to be careful now.  Nb6 seems reasonable for black to protect the promotion square and to open the 7th row so that the queen can get back into battle quicker} c4 {blocks access to the white lsb} 22. Be2 {Prepares to castle} Nc5 {pressures the a pawn} 23. Kf1 {I couldn't see the reason for this move so asked. It was to avoid nd3  Better would be a7 which relieves some pressure on the a pawn or for white to castle.   White should be looking to make himself some space and how he can attack the white squares around the king} Nb3 {Looking at Nd2+  White needs to keep his rook on the file or he will lose his a pawn. Blacks threats with the knight are only a distraction} 24. Rd1 {Poor move from white  Losing the a pawn is far worse than losing the d pawn, in addition he has now severely limited the scope of his lsb} Rxa6 {White has lost his strongest peice with barely a fight, he is in trouble now. The initiative has gone back to black} 25. Bh5+ {Doesn't really achieve much as black can easily defend against this} Bf7 {I would be tempted with Kd7 here pushing the white knight away} 26. Nb4 {Threatens the d pawn  I prefer 26: Bxf7 Kxf7 as it keeps the black queen out of harms way a little longer} Bxb4 {Risky move for black as it gives white a passed pawn, perhaps more importantly black is losing the bishop pair. He should concentrate more on getting his peices into better positions, particularly his queen} 27. cxb4 Ra2 {Wins the knight, I would prefer f5 to threaten the knight, if white blocks with d4 black gains at least one passed pawn} 28. Rb1 {Loses to Nxd2+ though I am unsure what else white could have done in this position  White is in dire trouble now} Nxd2+ {White loses the rook but more importantly white now can't stop the black queen penetrating his defences after f5} 29. Ke2 {This is an attempt from white to save his knight, though it will be pinned after 29 ... Nxb1 then 30 Rxb1 leaves the white bishop undefended and seals the white king in. White can surely not withstand much more pressure} Nxb1 {Black is so far ahead in material now that whites cause is clearly lost . Not resigning only extends his pain} 30. Rxb1 Bxh5+ 31. Kd2 Qf8 {Better was f5 with a view to Rxb2+} 32. Kc3 Ra3+ 33. Kc2 Qxb4 {Black has finally got his queen back into play and is threatening mate with Qc3.  White has few options 34 Nd2, Bxd1+ then if 35 Kxd1, Qxb1+ and mate is imminent or 35 Rxd1,Qc3+, 36 Kb1, Ra1#} 34. f3 {A good move from white to delay the inevitable} Rc3+ {Better was Qc3, forcing the king onto d1 on the diagonal that blacks lsb is on} 35. Kd2 Rd3+ {Double check so white must move the king.} 36. Ke2 Rd2+ {This potentially allows white some reprieve.  Better would be exf3, gxf3 as this opens up the first and second ranks where black can easily take control with his rook and queen. Alternatively c3. If white moves the knight he loses his rook} 37. Kf1 {Black is now in danger of letting white escape behind his g2 pawn} Rxb2 38. Rxb2 {White has no real alternative, the game is becoming increasingly painful for him} Qxb2 39. g4 {Probably the best move white could make under the circumstances} c3 {Looking for promotion which white cannot prevent  } 40. gxh5 c2 41. Kg1 c1=Q+ 42. Kh2 Qf1 43. fxe4 Qbxg2# {Thanks for reading}
