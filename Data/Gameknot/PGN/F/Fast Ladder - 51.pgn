[Opening "Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45)"]

1. d4 {This is a game where white delivers a brutal kingside attack and I made a serious blunder} Nf6 2. Bg5 {White goes for the Trompovsky attack} Ne4 {Attacking the bishop and gaining space in the center} 3. Nf3 Nxg5 {Bishops are usually stronger than knights in the endgame.} 4. Nxg5 e5 {White obviously cannot take the pawn or he loses the knight} 5. Ne4 d5 {d5 builds a strong center and attacks whites centralized knight} 6. Ng3 exd4 {bringing his Queen out for an early attack} 7. Qxd4 Nc6 8. Qd1 Bc5 {attacking the f2 square while preparing for castling} 9. e3 O-O 10. Nc3 {Hes attacking my pawn on d5 twice and its only defended once so i defend it with my bishop} Be6 11. Bb5 {Hes threatening to double up my pawns but I ignore this and attack his knight} d4 12. exd4 Nxd4 {I take the pawn with the threatened knight and attack his bishop on b5} 13. O-O {13...Nxb5 would be a mistake because of 14.QxQ RxQ then depending on which rook he could take my c or a pawn. To prevent this I move c6} c6 14. Bd3 {with an eye towards h7 good retreating square} h6 {I move the pawn to avoid capture after 15.Ne4 16.Ng6} 15. Qh5 {White develops his queen and attacks by c5 bishop.  Retreat or defend?  For the sake of my pawn structure I retreat to Bb6} Bb6 16. Nce4 {White is going for the juglar with 17.Ng4 if 17...hxN then 18.Qh7 mate} Bd7 {Retreating my bishop in anticipation of his move 17.Ng4} 17. c3 {Here he attacks my centralized knight and leaves his bishop undefended.} Ne6 {a good square for my knight because it exposes an attack on the f2 square and prevents Ng5.} 18. Nf5 {Hes going for mate, I'll stop it at the cost of ruining my kingside} g6 {He'll probably take the pawn 19.Qxp pxN 20.Ng6} 19. Qxh6 {This was my fatal blunder as black is easily able to checkmate me.  19. gxf5 leads to Nd6 but white has a move which i completely overlooked.} gxf5 {The beginning of my demise.} 20. Nf6+ {Now I cannot stop mate without losing my Queen so I resigned here.}
