1. e4 {This is a game where I dared to sacrifice a piece. Stay with me (or scroll to the end) to see how it turned out.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nxd4 5. Qxd4 d6 6. Bc4 {Nothing special so far} c5 7. Qd5 {I kind of like this position. I have a checkmate threat and he can't play 7.. Be6 to harass my queen.} Qe7 8. Bb5+ {Once again, he can't use his light-coloured bishop to get rid of the threat because of 9. Qxb7} Kd8 {I'm pretty satisfied with the opening. He gave up castling and I can dream of attacking his king with all of my pieces (of course, most of them are still undeveloped). Fritz likes this position ( 1.5 evaluation), but at the moment I hadn't any real plan in my head.} 9. Nc3 {Between castling and developing a piece, I chose the latter. It also protects my e-pawn.} a6 {I think it's a standard tactic to harass the opponent's pieces.} 10. Bd3 {10. Bc4 was another option} Be6 {Perhaps the best move. Now, Qxb7 isn't possible anymore and I have to run to h5} 11. Qh5 Nf6 {At this point, I wasn't happy with my position, because my queen was on the run. Black, on the other hand, kept developing pieces with tempo.} 12. Qe2 h6 13. O-O {Time to castle.} Kc7 {Looks a bit strange to me, but Fritz really likes this move.} 14. Bf4 {Time to develop the other bishop.} Re8 {This was the turning point for me. I decided to sacrifice a piece, although my plan didn't run very far (bishop for two pawns, then bring the knight to b5, then we'll see; I'm not exactly Kasparov). I don't usually sacrifice pieces like that and I wasn't hoping for much, but I thought it would certainly spice up the game.} 15. Bxa6 {Fritz is not very impressed by my move and, I suspect, neither is my opponent.} bxa6 16. Qxa6 {So far, so good. I have a passed pawn :) And some attacking prospects.} Qd7 {According to Fritz, this is quite a mistake, its evaluation jumping from  1.1 to  8 (unless my computer is crazy). It seems that the best move would've been 16..Kb8} 17. Nb5+ {In this case, the most obvious move is also the best one. Fritz says that by this point, black is toasted.} Kd8 {The alternative was 17..Kb8, in which case Black is also lost, but it's not obvious to me how (I'm not sure I would've found the right moves after 18. Nxd6). However, 17..Kd8 suits me because I realized that Qb6  seals the game.} 18. Qb6+ {His options are 18..Ke7 leading to checkmate in 2 or 18..Kc8, where he loses the queen. } Kc8 {Black chooses to stay in the game for a while.} 19. Na7+ {Her majesty falls for a knight.} Qxa7 20. Qxa7 {Now, it's a matter of technique, which I don't mind practising, because my technique isn't exactly superb.} Nxe4 {..but even I saw that the e-pawn wasn't available for grabbing} 21. Qa8+ {Having made his last mistake, Black resigned. Not exactly a brilliant game for any of us, but that's my level of play.}
