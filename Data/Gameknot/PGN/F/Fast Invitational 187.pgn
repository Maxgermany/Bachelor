1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nxd4 5. Qxd4 {The Scotch opening -- already a pair of Knights have vanished.} d6 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. Bg5 Be7 8. O-O-O O-O 9. Bc4 {Completing my development. Now the middle game begins.} h6 10. Bh4 Nh7 11. Bxe7 {Initiating another exchange.} Qxe7 12. Kb1 {To avoid any annoying checks on the diagonal.} Be6 13. Bxe6 fxe6 14. f3 {Solidifying my Pawn position. Material is even but I have control of more of the board.} a6 15. Ne2 Nf6 16. Qf2 e5 17. Ng3 Ng4 18. Qe2 {A few positional maneuvers...} Nf6 19. Rd2 Rfd8 20. Rhd1 Rd7 21. c3 Rad8 22. b4 {More slow maneuvering. Both sides have doubled Rooks on a closed file.} d5 23. exd5 {I expected the routine recapture 23... NxP, keeping material even.} c6 24. dxc6 {Now I have a small edge AND a chance to swap off the heavy pieces, magnifying the Pawn up. This is the turning point of the game.} Rd7xd2 25. Rxd2 Rxd2 26. Qxd2 {Even after Black takes the advanced QBP, I'll still have a 3 to 2 Q-side majority. I plan to advance these Pawns and force one through to the 8th rank.} Qc7 27. Ne4 Nxe4 28. fxe4 {I'm shocked Black exchanged off the Knights. With every piece that vanishes my advantage of one Pawn is magnified, and we're down to just one piece each left.} Qxc6 29. Qd5+ {Make that zero. This move seals the win for me.} Qxd5 30. exd5 Kf8 31. Kc2 {Now it's just a matter of technique. Of course, I must centralize my King.} Ke7 32. c4 {Now the wall of Pawns prevents Black's K from approaching on the Q-side.} Kd6 33. Kd3 {Movin' on up...} b6 34. a4 {Freezing the Q-side.} g5 35. h3 {I'm just waiting for Black to run out of Pawn moves.} h5 36. g3 {Now he has.} Kd7 37. Ke4 {If Black's KP falls, the game is over. My Q-side pawns will decide things.} Kd6 38. Kf5 {The KP must now fall. Black resigns.}
