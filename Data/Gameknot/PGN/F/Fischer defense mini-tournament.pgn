1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d6 4. d4 g5 5. h4 g4 6. Ng1 Bh6 7. Nc3 c6 8. Nge2 Qf6 {All games begin here. The Fischer defense to the King's Gambit.} 9. Ng1 Be6 10. Be2 Na6 11. Bxg4 O-O-O 12. Bxe6+ fxe6 {I have castled my King into a relatively safe spot. White has regained the gambit Pawn and has a spatial advantage but is slightly behind in development.} 13. Qg4 Kb8 14. Nge2 e5 {Intending to neutralize White's center.} 15. dxe5 dxe5 {The exchange gives my Rook an open file.} 16. Bd2 Ne7 17. O-O-O Rhg8 {Both sides complete their development, and I take the chance to drive the White Queen.} 18. Qh3 Nc5 19. Rhf1 Rg7 20. g3 Ng6 21. h5 Nf8 {White now has the opportunity to initiate a sequence of exchanges that will net him one Pawn.} 22. gxf4 exf4 23. Bxf4+ Bxf4+ 24. Rxf4 Qe7 25. Rxd8+ Qxd8 {The position has now simplified some, and White emerges with a passed KP -- the only significant difference in the game at the moment.} 26. Qh2 Ka8 27. b3 Nfe6 28. Rf5 b6 29. h6 Rd7 {After some positional maneuvering, I end up with my major pieces doubled on the Q file, though with no significant threats as yet.} 30. b4 Na6 {I duck clear of the attack.} 31. a3 c5 {An attempt to keep the White Q-side Pawns from steamrollering my position.} 32. bxc5 Naxc5 {Getting my Knight off the edge and back into the game.} 33. Qe5 Nd4 {Allowing an exchange, but to passively retreat would let White surge forward and strangle my position.} 34. Nxd4 Rxd4 {Reducing the forces aiming at my cornered King.} 35. Rf7 Rd7 {Forcing White to choose between simplifying down or playing for a mating attack.} 36. Rxd7 Qxd7 {White chooses to try and win in the upcoming endgame.} 37. Qh8+ Kb7 {The only real choice.} 38. e5 Qc7 {With a potential discovery on the unguarded White Knight.} 39. Qe8 Nd3+ {With the White Queen on the K file, I see a potential drawing mechanism. I offer the Knight as bait...} 40. cxd3 Qxc3+ {...to set it up.} 41. Kd1 Qxd3+ {With the Pawn blocking the White Q from guarding K3, I have a perpetual check on the 6th rank, which I take. Draw agreed.}
