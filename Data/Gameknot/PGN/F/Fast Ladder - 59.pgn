[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {Queen's Pawn is my favored opening with white} e6 {Heading for an Indian Defense perhaps} 2. e4 {Normally I would 2. c4 here for the Queen's Pawn Gambit but I decided to play away from my strength perhaps finding our way into a French} Qf6 {Out comes the Queen which is generally frowned upon} 3. Nf3 {Out of anything with which I'm familiar I tried to apply the strategy that my mentor (OldGus here at GameKnot) suggests. Make developing moves that put pieces in good positions} d5 {Now looking French like} 4. Bd3 {I'm thinking about eventuall Bg5 and trapping the queen or forcing a lot of queen defensive moves} Ne7 {My opponent cuts off all retreating squares making my life easier. It did take me some time to figure out 5. Bg5 was no longer the best move. If you see a good move, always look around and try and fine one better.} 5. e5 {Trapping the queen} Qxf3 {Making the best of a bad situation} 6. Qxf3 {Already with eyes towards a king side attack} g6 {Preparing to fianchetto and castle. The Bishop on g7 looks weak to me because of my strong pawn structure blocking the diagonal} 7. Bg5 {Development and threatening 8. Bxe7 preventing castling} Nec6 {A second knight move aiming for Nb4 possibly} 8. Bb5 {Preventing the knight from making headway} Bd7 {Relieving the pin} 9. Nc3 {Just getting my pieces out. I didn't feel an urgency to castle at this point} Nb4 {Threatening 10. Nxc2 winning the rook with a pin} 10. O-O-O {Preventing the pin. I went long side castle here because my Bishop on g5 prevents my opponent from long side castling and my king side attack is already rolling} Bxb5 {Hoping to win a pawn with 11. Nxb5 Nxa2+ but not seeing the continuation I think} 11. Nxb5 {Going for the combination} Nxa2+ {Taking the bait} 12. Kb1 {Now, saving the knight allows me 13. Nxc7+ and the fork} Nb4 {Perhaps hoping to trap my knight after Nxa8 and only lose the exchange} 13. Nxc7+ {Fork} Kd7 {The only move} 14. Qxf7+ {This was another case of holding my horses :-) and not immediately taking the rook but looking around for a better move} Kc8 {I think 14. Kc6 here is better as it gets the king a little more room to manuever} 15. Nxa8 {Now threatening mate } h6 {If 15. ... Nd7 then 16. Qe8#} 16. Qc7# {My opponent made some blunders here but what allowed me to take best advantage of them was looking deeper into the position for a better move than the one that first occured to me.}
