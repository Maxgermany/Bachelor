1. e4 {This is a classic miniature that demonstrates the danger of attacking too soon.} c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Bc5 {A mistake, according to the computer.} 6. Be3 Qb6 {Black piles the pressure on d4 and also threatens to nick a pawn on b2.} 7. Na4 {Possibly not the best response as the double threat will be exacerbated by ...Qb4 +....} Qb4+ {but the computer assesses this as a blunder.} 8. Nc3 {This too - 8. c3 was better, protecting both the Na4 and the Nd4 (subject to move order and pins).} Qxb2 {Another "blunder" as 8...Bxd4 would have been better, exploiting the overwhelming force attacking d4.} 9. Ndb5 {!  I was desperate at this point, thinking I'd blown the game already, but this resource rescued me, allowing me to protect both c3, a1 and a2, while threatening Nc7+, forking K and R and also threatening Rb1 trapping Black's Q.} Qb4 {?? Black should have continued to attack with ...Nb4!, threatening a similar fork on c2.} 10. Rb1 Qa5 11. Bxc5 {This capture appeared as an unexpected bonus ...} a6 {?  Better was ...Nge7 but Black was already in trouble.} 12. Nd6+ {!  There is no good reply, though the computer prefers ...Kf8 to ...Kd8.} Kd8 13. Bb6+ {Enough was enough.}
