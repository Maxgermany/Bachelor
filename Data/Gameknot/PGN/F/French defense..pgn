[Opening "French (C01), exchange, Svenonius variation"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 {The one work I have on the French doesn't cover the exchange variation, so it is all me from here on out, but, with a little experience in the Sicilian and Tarrasch defenses, I gave it a try.} 4. Qe2+ Be7 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bg5 O-O 7. O-O-O {This surprised me a bit here.  The thematic response to the Yugoslav attack is the d5 break.  This has also already occurred.  The Yugoslav is a fairly good tool by white against the Dragon variation of the Sicilian defense.  Some notable differences are present here:  Black gained time by deploying the bishop to e7 where the g6 pawn push was unnecessary.  If white exchanges knight for bishop, Black will have a strongly fortified g7 square and the diagonal control sought by the typical fianchetto move.  Also, Black can  defend the d5 pawn without too much trouble.  Opposite castling quite often leads to pawn storms.  Because Black is more secure than in the pure Dragon formations, he has more leeway to start a strong queen-side initiative.} Be6 {Thematic play in many Sicilian lines involves a rook on c8, so this move develops while strengthening d5 and clears space for the rook.} 8. Bxf6 Bxf6 {The bishop's diagonal is obscured, but Black believes the c5 break should remedy this.} 9. Nf3 {First f4 is advisable.  White's gameplan calls for a king-side push, and Nf3 prevents the f pawn from cooperating in the attack.} Qe7 {Three main purposes exist here.  First, c5 is now possible as b4 can no longer discourage the black advance owing to Qxb4.  Second, c8 is a great place for a rook.  Third, the knight needs to be developed.  If Qd7, then the b knight must wait for pawn advances or obscure a pawn's cooperation in the initiative.} 10. Kb1 {White is wasting time to see how black will begin, but this is very dangerous.  Black's attack, once begun, is likely to be fast.  White is behind in development and has neglected the typical counterplay.  The only useful motive here is freeing the c knight from the defense of the a pawn.  White has a handful of more useful moves most of which mobilize the kingside.} c5 {I partly wonder whether Rc8 first was more accurate.  The queen is not best situated on c5 (should White decide to exchange).} 11. Qb5 {I think I might have played the next move anyway, but this forces the issue.} cxd4 12. Nxd4 {White forced an IQP position.  Currently the d5 pawn seems overpowered.  White is in no real jeopardy and has some real tactical threats that can force concessions by black.  White also solved the problem, at least temporarily of the f pawn.} Rc8 {I neglected the threat of Nxd5.  This line is at least equal, if not better, for white.  Black has no reason to fear Nxe6.} 13. Nxe6 {To my eyes, the most promising line was 13.Nxd5 Bxd5 14.Nxe6 winning a pawn and maintaining pressure on black to play accurately.} fxe6 {Black not only gets rid of the isolated pawn but secures a fairly strong center too.  This comes at the cost of the bishop pair.} 14. Nxd5 {I actually kind of like this move.  White gets active play at the rough cost of a pawn.  He also removes the possibility Rxc3 which is fairly strong in Sicilian-like play.} exd5 15. Qxd5+ {Excellent move.} Qf7 {A pawn up, I tempt him to exchange.} 16. Qb5 {He has spent a good amount of time defending his queen.  He should occupy the d and e files with his rooks, but he cannot do that without a bishop move.  Bc4 is currently hollow, but it could quickly become sticky, so I play:} Qc7 {Threatening a mate sequence.} 17. Bd3 {I think this move is good.} a6 {Time for black to catch up in development and start a minority attack.} 18. Qa4 b5 19. Qe4 {Faced with a decision of pawn or rook, I save the rook.  I am not even sure that my next move here is correct.  I think White has at least a draw owing to the quickness of his attack.  e.g. Qxg7 , Bg6, Rhe1!, Qh8.} Nc6 20. h3 {White keeps squandering his time advantages.} h6 {I solve the weakness of the pawn to a limited extent, but I neglect the greater threat as proposed at move 19.} 21. Qh7+ Kf8 {I knew Kf7 was terrible after Bg6  where white gets to continue the plan with tempo.} 22. Qh8+ {The weaker move.  Kf7 creates a discovered attack against the White queen.  White has in essence given time to black once again.  Black gladly uses the time to prepare a defense of his King.} Kf7 23. Qh7 {I need a defense of g6.} Ne5 {Perhaps Ne7 was better because it also controls f5, but I liked the move because I needed the c pawn's defender removed.  It also dampens the threat of Re1.  (The idea of trading rook for a major defender of the black kingside is probably worth exploring.)} 24. Be4 {I think this works to my favor.} Rab8 25. Qf5 a5 {White currently has a comfortable game but has to play carefully.  Black must be wary too because the black king is vulnerable.} 26. f4 {I have to defend g6, so my immediate options are limited.} g6 27. Bd5+ Kg7 28. Qe4 {Now I can withdraw the knight.} Nc4 {To be clear I was contemplating taking his b pawn, but I couldn't imagine it happening with proper defense.} 29. Bxc4 {?? This move surprised me.  I think even if he "wins back" the pawn he is down, it does so at too great a cost.} bxc4 {He now must deal with a strong attack on his b pawn.  He lost the initiative and is on the defensive.  I think Re1 has been called for repeatedly in this game.  He can still storm with g4, but his King will get flushed out into the open board before he can capitalize on the weak black Kingside.} 30. b3 {An idea blossomed in my mind.} cxb3 31. axb3 {Honestly, I'm unsure how I thought he would deal with the threat.  His position is crumbling.} Rxb3+ {Let me help the collapse!  I honestly expected a resignation from my opponent after this move.  If Kc1 now, the black initiative is strong allowing black to accumulate advantages.} 32. cxb3 Qc3 {Perhaps a resignation after this move?  It is clear at this point that the only way to prevent mate is to give back some of the material black sacrifised.  I considered Qc3 prior to Rxb3 , but the move reveals the hand earlier so to speak, and White could play Kc1 stepping out of the net if Black plays Qa1 .} 33. Rd7+ Kf8 {Still threatening mate.} 34. Rf7+ {Yes, I have to take back the material.} Kxf7 35. Qd5+ {I really didn't have to think too long to come up with a plan to deal with this.  White would love to force a draw by threefold repetition here.} Kf8 36. Qd6+ Kg8 37. Qe6+ Kh8 {The rook sacrifice no longer looks like a sacrifice.} 38. Qxc8+ Qxc8 39. Rc1 Qf5+ {Much of the rest of the game was played with conditional moves programmed.} 40. Rc2 {Pins his only minor piece left, but I would have to maintain the queen's position.  It's like I lose a queen when he loses a rook.  Why help his cause?} Qxf4 41. Ka2 {Expected anything else because all I want is to move my queen to the 1st rank.} Qf1 {Threatening mate.  Actually it isn't so much threatened as forced:} 42. Rc8+ Kg7 {These king advances to challenge the rook were another set of conditional moves.} 43. Rc7+ Kf8 44. Rc2 {He sees that the challenge is fruitless, but given that he had not resigned I expected them to continue until the rook was captured followed by b4 and a5.} Qa1# {Checkmate.}
