[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 {I played 2. d4 expecting 2... d5 french defence} Qf6 {Unexpected probably trying to play scholars mate but I was wary as this was my first game on the website} 3. Nf3 {3. Nf3 so I could play } Nh6 4. e5 {4. Bg5  was better as it forced 4...Qg6} Qe7 5. Bg5 f6 {This was what I expected to be played and prepared to take the Knight on h6 and open up the king side and prevent him castling or his king would be exposed} 6. Bxh6 gxh6 7. Nc3 Rg8 8. g3 b6 {We both prepared to fianchetto on the h1-a8 diagonal. However my 8. g3 also stopped the Rook from capturing the g-pawn I if decided to develop to d3 or c4 or if Nc6 was played I could play Bb5 and stop him from moving his d-pawn otherwise he would be pinned} 9. Bg2 Bb7 10. Nb5 {?? I played this aiming to fork the King and rook but I forgot about 10... Qb4+ 11. c3 Qxb5} Qb4+ 11. c3 Qxb5 12. Qc2 Rg7 {Aiming to capture the h-pawn. Black defended while still controlling the half open g file} 13. Bf1 Qa5 14. Rg1 h5 {?! After I had played 14.Rg1?? Why not Bxf3 go up by 6} 15. Nh4 Nc6 16. Bd3 Rg5 17. Bxh7 fxe5 18. dxe5 Rxe5+ 19. Kf1 {After opening up the King side for an attack at a later date I lost the ability to castle by playing Kf1 planning on hand castling. 19.Be4 was also possible but led to counterattacking chances and causing the Queen to be stuck guarding the bishop. Also 19.Be4 Bh6 stops the ability to castle Queen side which would have been the point of playing 19. Be4 so I could play 20. O-O-O} Ba6+ 20. Bd3 {?! I thought of trading bishops so I could hand castle safely but after thought I realised if 20... Bxd3 2. Qxd3 I would been still down three and lose one of my main attacking pieces.} b5 {Instead b5 was played which was a dubious move weakening the fianchetto formation and creating a backwards a-pawn and an isolated b-pawn it also cut of the a6-f1 diagonal.} 21. Bg6+ {I wanted to remove the Black's ability to castle into his strongly protected queen side and I could do this thanks to 20... b5} Ke7 {Not the expected Kd8 hand castling although this may have been a better move considering I didn't have a dark squared bishop and allowed his a8 Rook to get involved.} 22. Kg2 b4 23. Rge1 {I planned on removing the E rook so I could strengthen my center} bxc3 24. Rxe5 Nxe5 25. Nf5+ {I had conceived if a combo and thought I was down by three and should try it out} exf5 26. Qxf5 {I needed to remove the Black queen of the 5th row so I could play Qxe5+  Kd8 Qe8#  I thought he would look to try and attack my rook with 26... cxb2 27. Rb1 Qb5 28. a4 Qb4 29.Qxe5+ Kd8 30. Qe8#} Bb7+ {This threw a spanner in the works as I didn't think about this as I believed he would focus on his isolated pawn on c3} 27. Kg1 {Next move my combination came into play} cxb2 28. Rb1 Qb5 29. a4 Qb4 30. Qxe5+ Kd8 31. Qe8# {Yes from a very bad Position I had stolen a victory}
