[Opening "Vienna gambit (C29), Breyer variation"]

1. e4 {I was able to fix the problems in the opening and then attack white's pawn chain which created some opportunities to create unbalances in the position that white didn't understand immediately and wasn't able to solve in due time, so he eventually blundered which allowed me to gain decisive material} e5 2. Nc3 {I'm not used to play against the Vienna opening, so I'll stick to opening principles Nf6 develops the knight and opposes to whites temporarily control of e4-d5} Nf6 3. f4 {now I'm in a more comfortable zone} d5 4. fxe5 Nxe4 {restore equality in a sharp start... white needs to start forming a plan to win now!} 5. Nf3 Be7 {main line here} 6. d4 {supports e5 but is a side line} c5 {with 20 games played 10 wins for black against 3 wins for white immediately challenges d4 support on e5} 7. Bd3 {challeges my knight} Nxc3 {to disturb white's pawns structure, this game will resemble a french defense without the e6 pawn} 8. bxc3 c4 {blocking the c pawns with tempo, now maybe castle short and f6 to challenge white's e pawn} 9. Be2 {white's bishop is forced back} Nc6 {development first, and castle next} 10. O-O O-O {now the idea is to play f6 at any point} 11. Qe1 {maybe to get to g3 and also defend c3, but here maybe a4 was in order threatening a5} Bf5 {hits c2 and forces white to defend it or lose it} 12. Bd1 {he does defend} f6 {now I need to create some tension on the center to solve latter with advantage, hopefully, also if exf6 Bxf6 and I have a nice threat on white's king after Qb6} 13. Bf4 {only idea I can think is to defend e5, because if white latter plays exf6 the bishop is placed  in a empty diagonal doing next to nothing} Qb6 {Qb6 pinning d4 and threatening Qb2, and ultimately also threatening c2} 14. Nh4 {?? blunder white needed the prophylactic Kh1, although then his c2 pawn would be at risk of being taken...} Be4 {solving the immediate threat Nxf5 and placed in the best spot to attack on both wings, my light squared bishop is a star in my arsenal...} 15. exf6 Bxf6 {again hitting d4 with another threat, now Kh1 is no longer enough white will lose material} 16. Kh1 {now I can infiltrate white's position via b2} Qb2 {threatens both c2 and the a1 rook, so white is compelled to move the bishop} 17. Bg4 Qxc2 {as planed} 18. Be6+ {just forces me to move the king achieves nothing} Kh8 {forced} 19. Rf2 {?? loses one piece to Bxh4, and now if Rxc2 Bxe1} Bxh4 20. Rxc2 Bxe1 {the end of a sequence that won me a piece} 21. Re2 {?? again blunders a piece... as I have Bxc3...} Bxc3 {...and now white still has two pieces "en prise", so he will lose one of them...}
