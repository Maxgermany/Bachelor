1. e4 {A game I had here recently. Feel free to leave any comments if you think I could have done anything better. Gameknot Computer Analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=22773517&rnd=0.7207947066053748} e6 2. d4 {Expecting a French.} Be7 {Doesn't look like a bad move, but surely there's more active solutions than this, such as d5.} 3. c4 {Gaining space.} Nf6 4. Nc3 {Oh how I love moving the knight after the pawn already moved. Perhaps one downside to my position is how the c&e pawns block my LSB. I do enjoy space, however~~} Nc6 5. Nf3 {I considered f4, but this seems more solid.} O-O 6. Bd3 Nb4 {I didn't consider this move.} 7. Be2 {I can kick the knight next turn, but black has a chance to play c5 now, which looks good, breaking at the center, while my king isn't castled. I may have space, but my opponent has a development advantage.} h6 {? I think c5 was a better move, Perhaps even d5?} 8. a3 Nc6 9. b4 {b4! If I castle here, black can play a5, restricting b4. } a5 10. b5 Na7 {I should be better here.} 11. O-O c6 {I considered a4, so if cxb I can recapture with the pawn, but this weakens the b4 square.} 12. e5 {Idea was to kick the knight, then go Ne4, to jump into blacks weak dark squares. Perhaps Re1 or d5 were moves to consider as well?} Nh7 13. Ne4 f5 {I was a bit worried to see this move, as it makes sense. Black can try for an attack on the kingside, though I believe my attack will be quicker, do to the big queenside space advantage.} 14. Nd6 {Had to move the knight. I don't think taking is good, as blacks dark squares will be very weak.} g5 15. d5 {I think this is important. I need to strike in the center/queenside before any kingside attack starts.} Qb6 {I don't like this, because of my response.} 16. Be3 Qc7 {Loses a piece. Qd8 had to be played.  Edit: c5 had to be played. Qd8 loses the knight after b6.} 17. b6 Qb8 18. bxa7 Qc7 19. Rb1 {Threatening Bb6, winning the queen, while developing.} b6 {Doesn't stop my threat.} 20. Bxb6 Qxd6 21. exd6 Bxd6 22. dxe6 Be7 23. exd7 Bb7 24. d8=Q {Trying to simplify the position. However, if Black hadn't taken with his A8 rook, things would have remained more complicated.} Bxd8 25. Qxd8 Raxd8 26. Bxd8 Rxd8 27. Rxb7 {An easy win now.} Nf6 28. Rb8 Re8 29. Rxe8+ Nxe8 30. a8=Q Kf8 31. c5 {Idea is to let my LSB in.} g4 32. Ne5 h5 33. Bc4 Ke7 34. Qxc6 Ng7 35. Qd6+ {And mate is coming soon. Hope you guys enjoyed! Expect to see more from me here!}
