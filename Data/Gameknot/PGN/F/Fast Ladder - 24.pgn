1. e4 {This is a long draw where I think we both missed a lot of chances, so hopefully it will be instructive to analyse it.  This is a fast ladder game against a tricky opponent against whom I have an uneven record ...We open with his usual brand of Sicilian, characterised by 2...Nc6.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. g3 {I don't usually fianchetto kingside against the Sicilian but this looked quite promising.} e5 7. Nde2 Bb4 8. Bd2 O-O 9. Bg2 d6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 {? This blocks my B in.  11. h3 was probably better.} Be6 12. a3 Ba5 13. b4 Bc7 {?  Now Black's DSB is as hemmed in as my LSB so we're about even here.  I think the nuisance check and claiming of the a7-g1 diagonal would have been better.} 14. Bg5 {Played to inhibit Black from advancing the N or d-pawn and to encourage Black to weaken the squares around his K with ...h6} h6 15. Be3 {The B returns to a better square than its previous base on d2.} Bb6 {If Black had put his B here on move 13, I wouldn't have been able to occupy e3 without preparation.} 16. Qd2 d5 {!  This is a good forcing move.  If White doesn't take, weakening his centre, or move either B from e3 or N from c3, then the pawn will fork them.} 17. exd5 Nxd5 18. Nxd5 Bxe3+ 19. Qxe3 Qxd5 {Following the series of exchanges, Black has the stronger looking position but his Q is vulnerable to attack.} 20. Rad1 Qa2 {Black goes pawn-hunting ...} 21. Rd2 {This move was designed to protect c2 and prepare doubling of rooks on the open file but the computer prefers the immediate 21. f4, which is, I suppose, more forcing.} Qc4 {I assume he was worried about 22. c3, revealing an attack on his Q, but then he could have nicked the a-pawn.  It was probably better to contest the d-file with a rook immediately.} 22. Rfd1 {Now, to me, my position looks much nicer than after move 19.  The computer evaluated them the other way round though.} Rab8 {Here the computer advocates immedate action with 22..a5 followed by swaps of pawns and queens, eventually giving black a pawn advantage.  The move played does get the rook off the long diagonal, where it was potentially attacked by the fianchettoed bishop, and prepares the advance of the b-pawn, which will block White's pawns.} 23. f4 {When, eventually, I do play this, the computer prefers 23. Nc3, where it would be imposing defensive duties on my Q.  I still prefer 23. f4, opening my diagonal and attacking Black's centre.} exf4 24. Qxf4 {Here, 24. Nxf4 might have been better.  The N is somewhat feeble on e2.} Rfe8 25. Nd4 {The N moves before it is attacked.  Now Black can swap it off and pursue his planned Q-side expansion.} Nxd4 26. Qxd4 b5 27. Qxc4 {I didn't think my Q could wreak any more havoc than his and I had long term hopes of capitalising on my Q-side pawn majority and my doubled rooks, so I decided to swap here.} Bxc4 {A nice outpost for his B.} 28. Bd5 {So I decided to swap it off immediately, possibly also disrupting his pawns.  However, my B was really stronger than his, so perhaps I should have kept them on and improved the position of my King with 28. Kf2, covering the square e2.} Bxd5 29. Rd2xd5 Rb6 {Presumably preparing to double on the e-file or slide around on the 3rd rank and defend his backward a-pawn.  The computer prefers 29. Rbc8, immediately attacking my c-pawn, which does look stronger.} 30. Rc1 {Preparing to push the c-pawn.  The computer prefers me to keep my rooks doubled and offer to swap with 30. Rd6, which it evaluates as dead even.} Rc6 31. Rd4 {Now the immediate 31. c4 would have been better.  After the rooks swap on c4, Black wouldn't be able to hold on to his extra pawn for long.} Re2 {Black occupies his 7th rank - always a good thing to do - and puts a double attack on the c-pawn - but that was about to move anyway.  Perhaps attacking White's a-pawn immediately was the better way to go.} 32. c4 Ra2 33. Rc3 {Not as good as creating a passed pawn on c5.} Re6 34. Rd1 {The computer prefers 34. Kf1, allowing Black to double rooks along White's 2nd rank , deliver several checks and snaffle the h-pawn.  I preferred to stop the classic 2-rook mate by pulling my rook back to the back rank.  Black will still be able to double on my second rank but I hope I'll be able to limit the damage.} bxc4 35. Rxc4 Rxa3 {I hadn't meant to drop this pawn though ...} 36. Rc5 {Preparing to block Black's pawn on a5, I think.  The b-pawn is now undefended and could have been quickly won by Black. } Rb3 37. Rc4 Rb6 38. Rdd4 {A strange place to double rooks but the pawn is still there!} Rb5 39. Kg2 a5 40. Rd8+ Kh7 41. bxa5 Rxa5 {Black could have inserted a couple of checks here, enabling him to improve his position before taking the pawn.} 42. Rd7 {and before attacking the f-pawn, I should have blocked access to my King by retreating the c-rook to c2.} Rb2+ 43. Kh3 Rh5+ 44. Rh4 {The danger to my h-pawn forces me to allow the rook swap.} Rxh4+ 45. gxh4 {Now Black has a passed f-pawn and I have virtually useless doubled h-pawns.} f6 46. Kg3 {An immediate 46. h5 would have held Black's King, h- and g-pawns back.} h5 47. h3 Rb3+ 48. Kg2 Kh6 49. Rd6 {Now I think I still have drawing chances if I can just frustrate Black long enough with pins and checks along the ranks - Black has to prove his win as I'm not going to give up without a fight.  The computer evaluats the position over the next dozen moves as Black being slightly more than 2 pawns up but no more than that.} Kg6 50. Re6 Kf5 51. Re2 Kf4 52. Rf2+ Ke4 53. Re2+ Re3 54. Ra2 Kf4 55. Ra4+ Re4 56. Ra2 g6 57. Kf2 Kf5 58. Ra5+ Ke6 59. Kg3 f5 60. Ra6+ Kf7 61. Rb6 Kg7 62. Ra6 f4+ {No comment from the computer but the evaluation drops to -1.49 with this move.} 63. Kf3 Re3+ 64. Kxf4 {But this is a mistake: Black can now mop up my two pawns.  I should have just retreated to g2 and continued with my harrassment strategy.} Rxh3 65. Kg5 {The computer would have played the nice drawing trap here of 65. Ra4 Rxh4+ 66. Kg5 Rxa4?? Stalemate.  I didn't spot it.} Rg3+ 66. Kf4 {The computer evaluation now gives Black 3.5 pawns advantage.} Rg4+ 67. Kf3 Rxh4 68. Ra7+ Kh6 {Now it's 4 pawns advantage.  If only the computer had a longer event horizon, I think it would have been predicting a forced win for Black here.} 69. Ra6 Rg4 70. Rb6 Rg5 71. Rb4 Rf5+ 72. Kg3 Rf6 73. Kh4 g5+ 74. Kg3 Kg6 75. Ra4 Kh6 76. Rb4 h4+ {A mistake, allowing White to settle his King on g4, preventing the pawns from advancing further.  Black should first have freed up his Rook for checking action from (e.g.) the d-file.} 77. Kh3 {But White returns the favour, increasing Black's advantage to 5.  g4 was the right square, preventing Black's King from advancing yet.} Kh5 78. Rb5 Rf3+ 79. Kg2 Kg4 {?  Black tries to throw the win away!} 80. Rb4+ {But White misses the opportunity: I could have got my draw immediately with 80. Rxg5+!! Kxg5 81. Kxf3 Kf5 82. Kg2 and I stop the pawn from queening by shuffling around on g1 and h1.} Rf4 81. Rb3 Re4 82. Rb2 Kf4 83. Rb3 g4 84. Rc3 {Apparently a blunder that should have allowed Black to queen.  The computer evaluates the position after this move as -13.34. Instead, I should have retreated to the second rank and switched to a policy of checks from front and rear: 84. Rb2 Rd4 85. Rf2+ Kg5 86. Rf8 h3+ 87. Kh2 Rd2+ 88. Kg1 g3 89. Rg8+ Kf4 90. Rf8+ etc, resulting in an evaluation of -5.21.} h3+ {In the line given by the computer at White's previous "blunder", the computer gave this move as the correct continuation.  But the evaluation after this move has reverted to -5.21: presumably another stark example of its event horizon.  Whatever, an advantage of 5.21 should enable Black to win from here.} 85. Kh2 Re2+ {and now the computer announces Mate in 12.} 86. Kg1 h2+ {But this is not the way to deleiver it, only evaluating to -7.52 ....  86...g3 was the correct move.} 87. Kh1 g3 {?? enabling White to win the g-pawn or draw immediately with 88. Rxg3 Kxg3 stalemate.  The rook is immune to capture while White's King is trapped in the corner and to free it up to move Black will probably have to give up the other pawn as well.} 88. Rc4+ {?? unfortunately, I didn't spot it yet.} Kf3 {?? Black should have put a stop to the checks with 88. ...Re4.} 89. Rc3+ {?? I still didn't spot it ...} Kg4 {?? Neither did Black} 90. Rxg3+ {!! but I did now :-)} Kh4 91. Rh3+ Kg4 92. Rxh2 Re1+ 93. Kg2 Re2+ 94. Kg1 Rxh2 95. Kxh2 {Two naked Kings face each other on a desolate field, exhausted to stalemate.}
