1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {I like the Scotch opening. Very straightforward but can quickly spiral into chaos.} Nge7 5. Bb5 a6 6. Ba4 b5 7. Bb3 {I've never played this variation} Ne5 {Not sure what he was going for. I thought this allowed me to push the f pawn and gain some momentum.} 8. f4 Ne5g6 9. O-O {I blundered here. My bishop is hanging by way of my knight.} c5 10. Bxf7+ {At least I'll get a pawn and disturb his king.} Kxf7 11. f5 {Now I'm glad I castled.} Ne5 {I'm down 2 pawns. If I let him develop any pieces I've lost.} 12. Qh5+ Kg8 {It seems like g6 probably evens things up or better if king goes to g8.} 13. f6 gxf6 14. Rxf6 Ne7g6 {Now my rook is in trouble, my knight is still hanging, and nothing else is developed. I felt I had only one choice.} 15. Rxg6+ Nxg6 {pawn takes would have given me the knight, but I still would have been behind. } 16. Qd5+ {Now there's no escape.} Kg7 17. Nf5+ Kf6 18. h4 h6 {anything else ... Bg5 mate.} 19. h5 {This is to move the knight away from guarding e5. I have one more piece to sacrifice.} Ne7 20. e5+ Kxf5 21. Qf7+ Kxe5 {g4 and e4 are quick mate} 22. Bf4+ Kd4 23. Qf6+ Kd5 24. Nc3+ Kc4 25. b3+ Kb4 26. a3+ Ka5 27. b4+ cxb4 28. axb4+ Kxb4 29. Qd4# {I'm pleased that my opponent let me play it out. }
