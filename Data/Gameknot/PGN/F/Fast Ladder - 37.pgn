1. e4 {great kings pawn.  time for sicilian.} c5 2. Nf3 {book} d6 {book} 3. Bc4 Nf6 {dragon setup... he's higher ranked than i, i might best to set my defense up quickly.} 4. d3 b5 {sometimes i like to move to b5, just to take that bishop off.  the temptation to steal material and check at once is hard to resist.  my bishop moves to d7, he takes it, and my knight goes to d7, and it's his turn.  in terms of development, it doesn't do much for either side, but that b file is open for my rook. } 5. Bxb5+ Bd7 6. Bxd7+ Nbxd7 {tada..  another advantage here is that the white bishop is white's most powerful bishop.  the black bishop, is black's most powerful bishop.  imo, bad exchange on white.} 7. O-O g6 {dragon continued..} 8. Nc3 Bg7 {..} 9. Re1 O-O {homework complete... let's go play outside.} 10. Rb1 Qb6 {i want to eye in on that f-file pawn.} 11. h3 {it's clear that i need to take this king from the h-file.  hopefully, i can open it up.  i'll make a sac play just to do it too} Rab8 {i like this setup. rooks are connected, and i'm attacking the b-file.} 12. e5 {this is going to be a fun exchange.} dxe5 13. Nxe5 Nxe5 14. Rxe5 {ok, not bad.  he owns that f-file, and i don't like it. i'm going to throw a weak curve-ball at him.  see if he bites.} Ng4 {i'm hoping takes the "free" knight, allowing me to grab his rook with bishop.} 15. Rxe7 {nope.  free pawn instead, as expected. continue with operation rook-evacuation} Qf6 {i like this because that king is in trouble as long as my knight remains there.} 16. Re2 {safe move} Qh4 {is this stupid?  it's a sac play, that i hinted at earlier.  i want that a-file.} 17. hxg4 {finally.} Bxc3 {i really like this move.  i HOPE bxc3 happens.  then rxb1 happens. } 18. Re3 Bd4 19. Rg3 Be5 20. Rh3 Qf6 21. Be3 {ok, this is exactly what i want to happen. i want my queen on d4, and eventually get one of my rooks to the a-file.  that bishop of theirs is going to be a pain.  hopefully, he'll exchange.} Rfe8 {my e-file rook will most likely be dead eventually, used to exchange with his h-file rook. my b-file rook will hopefully get to the a-file - with a monopoly.} 22. Bxc5 Bd4 23. Bxd4 {perfect.} Qxd4 {huge opening in the middle.} 24. c3 Qf4 25. b4 Re7 {there's no way he'll let me get my b-file rook over and own the e-file, but if he does, i'll hammer him.  if not...well, we continue with getting the b-file rook over to h.} 26. Rf3 Qxg4 {beautiful elimination of that pain} 27. Re3 {now, let's see if he takes my rook.  i want this exchange because his other rook is on vacation in iceland... as long as his b-file pawn is in the way.} Qh4 28. Rxe7 Qxe7 {sweet. he is in way more trouble than he thinks.} 29. Qe1 Qd6 {no thanks, i need her.} 30. d4 {if he moved his b-file pawn up one more, that would have complicated things for me.  i think mate is close.} Rb5 31. a4 Rh5 {operation a-file rook position completed.  now i need to find a check.} 32. g3 {dumb move} Qd5 33. Kf1 {i have a few options here. firstly, i can easily exchange my rook for his queen by moving the rook to h1! that is temping, but i need to focus on mate, and not material.  hard to avoid though.  :)} Qf3 {i like this move a lot.  h1 is mate, provided that there is a piece on e1.  i expect the queen to check my king, and his rook to move over... but let's see.} 34. Qe8+ {i think his best move would have been q to e2... and take the exchange.} Kg7 35. Re1 {game over.} Rh1# {thanks for watching.. please send feedback.}
