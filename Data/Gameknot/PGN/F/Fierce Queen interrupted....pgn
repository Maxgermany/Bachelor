1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 Bg7 4. c3 {always the deal breaker in this type of Sicilian; after dxc5, there is no Qa5+...} cxd4 5. cxd4 Nf6 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Bc4 {the Fischer move for white... sadly enough, white is confusing playing systems against the Sicilian... probably best is Bd3/Qb3, d6...} Nxe4 8. Bxf7+ {after Nxe4, of course d5 winning the piece back; but this is worse... after first Ng5, Bxf7+ might turn the tables; but not here...} Rxf7 9. Nxe4 d5 {as always, d5 is the crown on how the Sicilian is done... white is already in trouble...} 10. Ned2 {at this stage, the awkward looking Neg5, Rf5, 0-0, h6, Nh3, might be the only option... again, this is making matters worse...} Nc6 11. O-O Qd6 12. h3 Nxd4 13. Nxd4 Bxd4 14. Nf3 Bg7 15. Qb3 e5 16. Bd2 h6 17. Rad1 e4 18. Ne1 d4 {the smoke is clearing; in exchange for the c-and f-pawn, black has it all...} 19. Bb4 Qb6 20. Qa3 e3 21. fxe3 dxe3 22. Rxf7 e2+ {the culmination of blacks' play; of course, after Bc5 - breaking the hidden check - there is always exd1Q... then might follow Rxg7+, Kxg7, Bxb6, Qxe1+, Kh2, and white is a rook behind... but justice is feeble...} 23. Rd4 {you have to see this, to truly believe it; not only manages white to totally ruin blacks' planned Queen sac, he also manages to find the next best move... but to no avail...  } Bxd4+ {not too soon to give up; after Kh1/h2, Kxf7, white has no play left... and resigns...}
