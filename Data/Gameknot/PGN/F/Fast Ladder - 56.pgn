1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Bg5 {I recently lost a game which started with 3. Bg5 so I wanted to jump back into the saddle again} e6 4. e3 Be7 {When defending against the QGD I prefer Bb4 but I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with 4. ... Be7} 5. Nc3 O-O 6. Nf3 h6 7. Bh4 {Again, I recently lost a game when retreating this Bishop in this fashion and wanted another go at it} Nc6 8. Bd3 Nb4 {Normally black will capture dxc4 at this point forcing another move by the Bishop and gaining a tempo. I don't see anything wrong with this except it is a second move with the Knight before Black is fully developed.} 9. O-O c5 {Often times Black will play this move earlier in the game and it does often lead to sharp encounters} 10. cxd5 {Normally it is considered a bad choice for White to play cxd5 in the QGD but I was feeling a bit cramped and with my pieces better developed than Black's I thought aggression might be the better play} Nbxd5 11. Nxd5 Nxd5 12. Bxe7 Qxe7 {I'm not sure 12. ... Nxe7 is better but I don't like the Queen on the e7 square and it does end up costing Black in this game. } 13. Rc1 {I didn't like 13. dxc5 Qxc5 letting out Black's Queen and any continuation that led by my knight occupying the d4 square seemed fine to me} b6 14. dxc5 {Now it is different because Black cannot capture with the Queen and must again place a pawn on c5 both blocking the Queen and becoming isolated.} bxc5 15. Bb1 {My thinking here was that I wanted Qd3 forcing Black to retreat the well placed Knight with Nf6 or weaken his pawn structure with f5 or g6 in order to prevent Qh7#. None of this happens in the game.} Ba6 {Forcing my hand} 16. Bd3 {The other choice is 16. Re1 which I just did not like although in this case I'm moving a piece back to the square it just occupied.} Bxd3 {If not a capture then Black must play either 16. ... Qd6 or 16. ... Qb7 or retreat the Bishop. I'm not sure any of those is better but I was glad to see that light squared Bishop off the board} 17. Qxd3 Nb4 {Forcing the Queen back to protect the a pawn} 18. Qb3 Rad8 {Taking the open file} 19. Ne5 {I'm making threats of Nc6 eventually but this is not a super strong position for the Knight because it is relatively unstable. But, for the moment it is a good spot. My plan was 20. a3 Na6 putting Black's remaining Knight in a bad spot} f6 {This was the mistake that cost my opponent the game} 20. Ng6 Qf7 {I thought something a little more aggressive with the Queen might be in order at this point. 20. ... Qc7 is probably best protecting the c pawn} 21. Nxf8 Rxf8 22. Rxc5 Na6 {I thought perhaps 22. ... Nd5 23. e4 Nf4 was better} 23. Rc6 {Attacking both the Knight and the pawn at e6} Nb8 {23. ... Nc7 24. Qb7 loses the Knight or allows a Queen trade} 24. Rxe6 Nd7 25. Re7 {I thought this was a nice little move taking advantage of the discovered pin and forcing the Queen trade although I do end up with doubled pawn} Qxb3 26. axb3 Nc5 27. Rxa7 Nxb3 {I'm not sure snagging the bad pawn was such a great move but it probably doesn't make much difference} 28. h4 {Avoiding any possibility of a back rank mate} Nd2 29. Rd1 Ne4 30. Rdd7 {I pick up another pawn} Rc8 31. Rdxg7+ Kf8 32. Raf7+ Ke8 33. Rfe7+ {Hoping for a blunder like 33. ... Kd8 34. Rxe4} Kf8 34. f3 Nd6 35. Rec7 Rxc7 {I think was a mistake. Black must keep that last Rook on the board to have any hope at all} 36. Rxc7 Nf5 {Now Black's King is trapped on the last rank and I just need to push pawns until Black is forced to trade his knight for a forward pawn} 37. e4 Nd4 38. b4 Nb5 39. Rh7 Nc3 40. g4 Ne2+ 41. Kf2 Nf4 42. b5 Kg8 43. Rd7 Ne6 44. b6 Nc5 45. Ra7 Kf8 46. b7 {After much manuevering the Knight must capture} Nxb7 47. Rxb7 {Now it is a matter of forcing my two extra pawns down the board or bringing my king into play to get a King-Rook mate.} Ke8 48. f4 Kf8 49. g5 f5 {Capture might be better but this does set up a potential Stalemate and that was likely my opponents plan} 50. gxh6 Kg8 51. e5 Kh8 {52. h7?? Stalemate is Black's last hope} 52. e6 {Not falling into the trap, mate is now forced} Kg8 53. Rf7 Kh8 54. e7 Kg8 55. e8=Q# {I was happy with my play in this game. I managed to gain an exchange and then through forcing play traded off all the remaining pieces allowing me to push a pawn and win the game.}
