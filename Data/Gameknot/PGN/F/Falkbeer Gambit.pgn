1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 {I have heard from a friend that 2...d5 response makes the black have a better position in king's gambit.I played this move by trusting this rumour.} 3. exd5 exf4 {Here we exchanged the pawns.} 4. Nf3 {This move is to prevent Qh4  i think.Because after another move(for example Nc3) 4...Qh4  5.g3 fxg3 6.hxg3 Qxh3 so he stays one pawn back cannot capture with h pawn.Or he would play Ke2 and would not be able to castle anymore.probably there are other possibilities that i missed.if you help me with your comments i will be very thankful.} Be7 {With the idea of Bh4 } 5. Nc3 Bh4+ 6. Nxh4 Qxh4+ {He is forced to move his king.} 7. Ke2 Bg4+ {Here he resigns.}
