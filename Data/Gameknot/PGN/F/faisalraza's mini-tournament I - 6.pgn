1. d4 {Black blundered on an exchange allowing me to pin his rook and eventually exchange my two rooks for Q+N, this being said the resulting endgame was a matter of technique...} Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. g3 b5 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. Qd3 a6 {and now a4 to stir things up a bit} 6. a4 b4 7. O-O {following Cramling, Pia - Cmilyte, Viktorija, Elista, 2004, 1/2-1/2} c5 8. c3 d5 {and black diverged from Cramling-Cmilyte... he probably intends to block my pawns with c4-b3 next, so if I want to keep the position dynamic I need to exchange dxc5 or push the c pawn, or get my knight to e5 with the idea of playing some tactics with Nxc4-Bxb7...} 9. Ne5 {I'll try to surprise my opponent with the mentioned tactics...} Nbd7 {now I'll do some exchanges, to avoid having my queen side closed by black's pawns advance...} 10. Nxd7 {a little trap, because if  black plays the seemingly natural c4 to execute the queen side block plan, he then would face the loss of a piece with Nxf6+ with tempo and them I simply move the queen away from d4} Qxd7 {he didn't fall for that trap and now we have cxb4 cxb4 and then Nd2 or Bg5...} 11. cxb4 cxb4 12. Nd2 {development, Nd2-b3 eyeing both a5 and c5} Bd6 13. Nb3 O-O 14. Bf4 {to challenge the dark squares, and offer the exchange of black's best bishop...} a5 {wisely refuses the exchange, and improves his light squared bishop} 15. Nc5 {now I invite, Bxc5 dxc5, and after this I'll have a passed, yet unprotected c pawn} Bxc5 16. dxc5 {I now have the bishop pair and a passed pawn} Ba6 17. Qd2 {avoids a probable center pawns push with tempo by black if I would have played Qe3, also allows me to push e4 at any time, and at the same time invites black to go in to the line Ne4 Bxe4 dxe4 and then either to exchange queens or to place the dark squares bishop on d6 supporting c5 and at the same time in a nice attacking outpost... e expect black to prepare Ne4 with Rd8, due to the threat Qxd7} Rfc8 {?! to place a rook on the c column is also sound theory, but I doubt this is the best rook to do it as the f rook may be needed to support the advance of the central pawns, best was probably Rac8 with the same general idea, but keeping the f rook free to support the central pawns advance, unless black's plan is to double rooks on the c column?} 18. Rfc1 {needed} Rc6 {trying to double rooks on the c column, so my reply has to have that in account... Rc2 to support the c5 pawn from behind or Bd6, but Bd6 has the disadvantage of inviting Ne8, while Rc2 and b3 is improbable as it exposes the a5 pawn to my queen...} 19. Rc2 {now I expect Rac8, if, as I think, doubling rooks was black's plan anyway} Rac8 {Rac1 is the next move as Qe3 or Be3 both fail to the previous plan, of having available the chance of playing the pawn push e4 and Qd4 loses the e pawn as Bxe2 can't be captured due to Rxc5 and black would have a slight advantage as he would control the open c column, also Bd6 fails to Ne8} 20. Rac1 {forced} Qa7 {so I have two main options, ignore the threat on c5 and play either b3, avoiding b3 by black or Bf3 to protect e2 and defend against a possible Ng4/Nh5, or to defend c5 with both Qe3, in this I might lose a pawn to Ng4 Qd4 Bxe2, and Be3 ?} 21. h3 {h3! a quiet move that defends a possible Ng4 and sets a trap, because if Rxc5 I have Qe3 pinning the rook, then even if Nd7 I have both e4 and Bd6 as possible tries... also after Qe3 if Bc4 and I have Bd6} Rc6xc5 {? now Qe3 pins the rook} 22. Qe3 {! and my opponent doesn't have Ng4 due to h3!} Nd7 {! and now after Rxc2 and Rxc1 I don't have Bxc1, also Ne4 allows Bxe4 and Bc4 to block the c column has b3 as a good reply} 23. Bd6 {immediately hitting the pinned rook with another threat so that black isn't allowed to lift it, or further defend it} Rc5xc2 24. Qxa7 {I expect Rxc1 and now I don't have Bxc1 due to Nd7!, but then after Kh2 black still has two pieces "en prise"} Rc2xc1+ {queen and one minor piece for two rooks, I'll take that any day!} 25. Kh2 {forced as Bf1 has Bxe2 as counter-strike, now black has to choose to give up his bishop or his knight...} Bxe2 26. Qxd7 {it's his knight} h6 {to have an escape square for his king undoubtedly...} 27. g4 {to vacate g3 for my king, allowing him to defend f2 and move nearer the center} Bd3 {?! the point of this move?} 28. Kg3 {according to my plan this defends f2 white centralizes the king} Bg6 29. h4 {heading to h5} d4 {? too passive...} 30. h5 {now if:  a) Bh7?? blocks the only escape square from black's king and I have Bb7 to win a quality, as black's rook can't move away from the 8th rank; b) and if Bc2?? I have Qxc8+ followed by Be4 to win a rook and a bishop;  c) and if Bb1?! I have Bb7 threatening to win a quality; so I expect to see Bd3, the only playable move by black...} Bb1 {?!} 31. Bb7 {and now if the rook abandons the 8th rank I have Qe8 whining the f7 pawn and pinning the  g7 pawn next to threat Be5 and mate in one} Rg1+ {running foreword achieves nothing for black, now it's just a matter of time, this just momentarily avoids  the loss of the rook, but allows me to put my king on a safer position, and still get to capture the f7 pawn and threat Be5 with mate in one (which eventually will win a quality, as black would need to sacrifice it to avoid the mentioned mate)} 32. Kf4 {as the c column is blocked by black's pawn this avoids any delaying checks given by black's rooks on the first rank, while places the king on a more active (defends the both threats Be5 and Be4) and more protected position (by blacks blocking d4 pawn and my own f pawn, eventually pushing it to f3) } Rcc1 {this or Rc4, Rc2 the other possible square loses the rook to Qe8+ and Be4 as it blocks his own bishop from defending e4... } 33. Qe8+ {Qxf7 next} Kh7 {only} 34. Qxf7 {as planed}
