1. c4 {In this game, I blunderd badly in the opening, and somehow I managed to survive by attacking up to the last with the very last pawn...} Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. d4 b6 {I just don't know how to play the English, and since I play the Budapest, I am not experienced in this kind of scheme. Now I play uncommitedly, assuming the fianchetto is not bad, but I'm not sure. Theory has to say something about that, for sure. } 4. a3 {A loss of time, but it is not easy to cash it. A pawn storm can be dangerous...} d5 {Let's start the fires. If I have my bishop on b2 first, I allow him to b4, and now c5. } 5. Bf4 {I can't afford to close the d column right now, so I have to... close it!} Bd6 {Closing it, but in a nasty way. If white exchanges, the white diagonal is closed by a black pawn, so I don't care to lose a tempo playing Bb7 if not necessary. And my bishop will have the c8 - h3 diag to look at. } 6. Bxd6 {Now, I didn't want to have the c pawn not on the c column, so I dared to play...} Qxd6 7. Nb5 {...of course, this is the result. } Qe7 {Ok, so what? I just overlooked the Nxc7 treath. } 8. Qa4 Bd7 {?? c6 was advisable. } 9. Nxc7+ Kf8 10. Qd1 {Now, what would you do? I have a spare tempo that whorts a rook, and, maybe, a knight. How can I spend it? I can move Ba4, exchanging BxN, but is seemed ugly to me. Without a bishop... So I adventured...} dxc4 11. Nxa8 g6 {I needed more tempos to have my pieces into action, not to take the knight. . Let's see what happens. } 12. e3 b5 {My bishop has to be free to go into the diagonal. } 13. Nf3 Kg7 {My bishop still can go there, so I better keep on with my developement. } 14. Nc7 Bc6 {White should take Nxb5, but he is scared about his king behind, so...} 15. Na6 {he prefers to deploy my knight to an useless square. Good. } Nxa6 {The worst possible position for my stallion, provided white doesn't go for d5.} 16. Ne5 Bd5 {Of course I have to keep my bishop. } 17. Be2 {? Just an oversee, or white does want to open the g column and attack my king? This is becoming very interesting, but I swear white won't succeed. } Bxg2 18. Rg1 Bh3 {This is the weapon. My bishop will exchange any white firepower, and my material disadvantage is now just -1. There is plenti of game ahead. } 19. Bg4 Bxg4 20. Nxg4 Nxg4 21. Qxg4 {In oing this, white is self-releasing me of the d5 threat, not having the knight defending this square anymore. } b4 {I want to react very quickly, before white castles and remembers that he has h and f pawns... :-)} 22. Ke2 c3 {I want my knight to enter into the game. It is not easy. } 23. bxc3 bxc3 24. Rgc1 Qc7 25. Rc2 Qc4+ {I thought it was a good idea to penetrate up to this point, but I "lanunched without a parachute", as we would say in Spanish, since the c pawn is doomed, so I need a good reason to give it away, or a good manouver to save it. I didn't realize the danger I was gettin into. } 26. Kf3 Qd3 {Yes, it helps to preserve c3. } 27. Rac1 h5 {?? The idea of a ... you know, an intermediate move, could work, but not the execution. f5 was correct, avoiding...} 28. Qe4 {And my edge is gone!!!!!} Qxe4+ 29. Kxe4 f5+ 30. Kd3 Nc7 {I can't defend my pawn, but at least I'll put at work my knight. } 31. Rc2xc3 Nd5 {...in a very good spot. } 32. Rc3c7+ {So good, that my oponent returns me the favour, convinced that the a pawn will give him the victory. } Nxc7 33. Rxc7+ Kf6 34. Rxa7 {And this is, I think, and interesting endgame. Black is lost, but white has to prove it... in a blitz. } Rc8 35. Kd2 Rb8 36. Rc7 Rb1 {Or Rb7. But all are moves that I plan to repeat. White has to prove how to advance. } 37. Rc1 Rb2+ 38. Rc2 Rb3 39. Rc3 Rb2+ 40. Rc2 Rb3 {As I said, white has to prove...} 41. Ra2 {So that's nice. Now I'm in trouble. I know that defending I'll die, so...} f4 42. e4 Rh3 43. a4 Rxh2 {Now white can't allow Rxf2+} 44. Ke2 Rh3 45. a5 Rb3 46. Rc2 {White should keep advancing the pawn. } Ra3 47. Rc5 f3+ {Because of white's mistake, black now has serious chances. } 48. Kd2 h4 49. e5+ Kf5 50. d5 exd5 51. Rxd5 {Still, white has troubles stopping the pawn!} h3 52. Rd8 Kg4 {If h2, Rh8 and I lose it. I can draw with Rook checks, but... what's the fun of it?} 53. Rg8 g5 54. e6 h2 55. Rh8 Ra2+ {This is nice. If white goes to the first row, I play h1=Q+. White has to take it, but then, Ra1+ would win the rook AND will come just on time to stop the pawn. Do you like it? But if the king tries to defend f2 (he should not!), he'll fall in another trap: } 56. Ke3 {Now the "tricky" move. } Re2+ 57. Kd4 Rxe6 {White has lost his advantage. But Black could have played Rxf2, e7, e8=Q, RxQ, RxR, h1=Q and wins. } 58. Rxh2 Ra6 {White can't defend the pawn. } 59. Rh1 Rxa5 60. Rc1 {It is a matter of time, now, I think...} Ra2 61. Ke3 {White falls for the second time in the same trap. But wait. } Re2+ 62. Kd4 Rxf2 63. Rg1+ {Now white is lost. But see. } Rg2 64. Rf1 f2 65. Ke3 Kg3 {Black managed to get into a draw position!} 66. Ke2 g4 {White can move from e3 to e2 all the time, and gets a draw!} 67. Rh1 {Once more, my opponent helped me. } Rg1 68. Rh3+ Kxh3 69. Kxf2 Rg2+ {And my opponent surrended. }
