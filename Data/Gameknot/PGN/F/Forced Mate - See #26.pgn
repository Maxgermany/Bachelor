1. d4 {This was a fun game with a nice forced checkmate at the end.  Black fought well and only really made one big mistake... } d5 2. c4 {c4 attacks} dxc4 {accepted } 3. e3 {I used E3 this time instead of E4.  I give up control of d5 and f5 and block my dark bishop in exchange for the strenght of protecting d4.} Nf6 4. Bxc4 {Quickly white has nice postion and development.} e6 5. Nf3 {preparing to castle} Bb4+ {check threat.  I don't mind the impending exhange as it move my bpawn closer to the centre and supports the d4 square.  Since I am castleing kingside, its all good.} 6. Nc3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 {The predicated exhange is done.  Black can now castle and beat white to it!} O-O 8. O-O Qe7 {Interesting.  I was expecting Nc6} 9. a4 {I try this attempt to open up the double pin with Ba3} a6 {Here is the big mistake.  I believe black may not have realized the threat.} 10. Ba3 {There it is.  Attack!} Qd8 11. Bxf8 {Wins the rook} Qxf8 {In exchange for the bishop.  Black is still in the game but never recovers..} 12. Rb1 {Attack the file} b6 13. Qc2 {freeing up the second rook and putting some pressure on h7} Nc6 {black is developing the last of his power players} 14. Rfd1 Na5 {Attacks the bishop} 15. Bd3 {More pressure on h7} Bd7 {Black clears the back row.} 16. Ng5 {Even more pressure on h7.  3 attackers and 2 defenders...} Qe8 {Avoids an attack on the Q with the knight and potential mate} 17. Bxh7+ Kh8 18. Be4 {back to attack Ra8} Bxa4 {look familiar???  Good move but I have a few options.} 19. Qd3 {This leads to rook exchanges} Bxd1 20. Bxa8 Bb3 21. Be4 {even steven but white still has position and up those 2 points from the earlier rook/bishop exchange} Nxe4 22. Qxe4 {I questioned black's willingness for this exchange as it put white in a potential mating postion.  It seeems usual to exchange players so willingly when black was behind.} g6 23. Qe5+ Kg8 24. Qxc7 {Captures pawn and puts the Q in a position of power on the 7 rank} Bc4 25. Rxb6 {white is very strong here as Rb8 threatens to capture the black Queen} Kg7 26. Rb8 {This is a forced checkmate from this postion unless the black Q captures the attacking white rook.  Can you spot the mate if Qa4?} Qa4 {I know the game is won at this point.  Its 3 move to mate.} 27. Qxf7+ {1} Kh6 28. Rh8+ {2} Kxg5 29. Qf4# {3 Checkmate!}
