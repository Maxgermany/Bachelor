1. d4 {This was a non rated game for tutoring purposes, between myself, Scott Miller (faithfulltrav) and my new friend Ananya (ananyapathak). So, Ananya, I want to start by letting you know a little about where I am coming from when I tutor chess, my favorite game. First I want to say, there are varying ideologies and styles of play. I for one am a fairly aggressive, very calculating player. I am a much stronger tactical player than I am strategic. For the difference, imagine a general in a war. He may say to his men "OK, there are 10,000 of us. I want 9,000 men to lay in wait at the top of this hill. The other 1,000 of you go make like you are attacking the enemy town down below. When they come out after you, flee to the cave at the bottom of the hill. Then the 9,000 at the top attack them. That is strategy. It is an overall plan. Then the general may say, "When you engage in hand to hand combat, use the long swords, as you can strike from a greater distance. Keep your daggers ready though." That is a tactic, not a strategy. Strategies give general direction, tactics are more specific. So in our game, for example, part of my strategy in the middle game was to force you to trade off your DSB, then infiltrate the h6 square and attack your g6 square, to open your king to attack. That's strategy, my basic game plan. Tactics were putting my bishop on h6 to trade bishops, push my h pawn to make space for my knight to go to h2, then g4, to bring my queen to h6, to push my pawn to trade on g6, ect. So tactics are the processes used to apply the strategy. A more strategic player may look at one of my comments and say, "Ananya, this guys is leading you wrong." It's not that I'm leading you wrong, but that I can only lead based on my own style. A strategic player will lead differently than a tactical player. A passive player will give different advise from an aggressive player. That's not to say anything bad about passive chess players, as I've met passive players who I could not beat. I had a friend in college named Pablo. He'd sit back, making very passive moves. He'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up, then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive! So when taking advise, (from me or anyone else) take it all in from as many sources as possible, then make a rational decision for yourself, based on your own style and abilities, what is for you.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 {So, at this stage in the game I thought we were going into the KID. I was looking forward to a intense battle, as this defense gives a lot of tactical opportunities for both sides.} 3. Nc3 d5 {So on your 2nd move I was wrong. Your playing the Grunfeld Defense. According to MCO, the vast majority of lines in this defense give White at least a slight advantage. Some lines give Black equality, and a rare few give Black a slight advantage.   I found this very encouraging, because I know that a very slight advantage, if played accurately, becomes a great advantage, which in turn, if worked correctly, becomes a won game.} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. cxd5 {So I chose to play the Grunfeld Defense, Exchange Variation. In this variation, Black willingly allows White to establish an imposing pawn center, with intention of attacking and destroying that center! So it's an intense debate between the 2 sides, a debate won not with words, but in tactical chess moves. White says, "My solid pawn center will restrict your pieces, giving me a superior position!" Black says, "Your pawns are weak! I'll use my pawns to destroy your weak pawn center! I will undermine those overly advanced pawns, and trade them off and gain a free open position!" What I find is interesting is, if White succeeds in keeping this "strong" pawn center, he will definitely have the better game. Yet, if black accomplishes his goal of undermining and trading off White's pawns, in my opinion, he will probably gain equality, but he still has a major fight to gain superiority! This is why I love to play White against the Grunfeld.} Nxd5 6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 {So, now I have my solid pawn center! It's your job to prove my pawns are not as strong as I think they are. Your tactics should include c5, which you did on move 8, and c5xd4, which you never did. To attack my LSB, you played c4 (move 16). Since pawns can't move backwards, you would never again get the chance to play c5xd4! Thus my pawns on c3 & d4 were pretty secure. As my attack developed, I saw opportunity to use my LSB to attack g6, were it not for the e4 pawn. So I had to push this pawn & trade it off to open the line. Once I did this, you had no more pawns to use in your attack against my center. The c-pawn was overly advanced, and can't attack the center. The d & f pawns were traded off. The e-pawn was blocked behind my knight on e5, and can't attack the center. So the only remaining pawn that could attack my center was the b pawn, by advancing to b4 and capturing c3. My move Rb1 (which I made more for attacking purposes than to stop the pawn) permanently kept him at bay, though. To see the details of the position I just described, look at 27. Ne5. **************************************************************** So I won the debate I spoke of. The only pawn that was eliminated was the one I chose to trade off to open lines for my attack.} O-O 8. Be2 c5 {So you begin your attack on my pawns.} 9. O-O Nd7 10. Qd3 Qc7 11. Rb1 b6 12. Bg5 Re8 {The bishop move was only a superficial threat on your e pawn. If 13. Bxe7 Ne5, attacking my queen. 14. PxN or NxN then you play QxB. So I've won a pawn but my own pawn structure is pretty bad. Given the chance, I would not have played Bxe7, as it violates my strategy in this opening: to maintain a solid, overbearing pawn center. Instead I would have played 13. Qe3 (as I actually played) and followed my expected plan.} 13. Qe3 {13. Qe3 has the triple purpose of 1: Making space for 14. Bd3, since I figured you would play 13. Bb7, 2: To get my queen on the c1-h6 diagonal to prepare for Bh6 and 3. To possibly chase your queen from the b8-h2 diagonal, which I never chose to do. It's good to give yourself options though.} Bb7 14. Bd3 e6 {I did not understand the purpose for this move. I was expecting cxd4, followed by e5. Hit at my pawns!} 15. Rfe1 f6 {This move weakens your g6 square. As you saw later in the game, you could not defend that square enough, so I won a pawn. I can't say you should never advance pawns in front of your king, but when you do, proceed with caution. When you made this move, with my bishop on d3, I immediately started looking for ways to hit g6.} 16. Bh6 {If you trade here with BxB, it would be very bad for you, as I get my queen easily in your house, an uninvited guest sitting in your favorite reclining chair in your living room. It is better to wait as you did, making me trade on g7.} c4 {(???) This move helps me to keep my pawn center intact. I'd say cxd4 is good. I'd still have the d & e pawns, but without the c pawn supporting the d pawn, my pawn center is somewhat weaker. On the kingside though, since you did not take, our DSB's actually block my queen from getting in, I decided to trade bishops and devise another way in to g6.} 17. Bxg7 Kxg7 18. Bc2 a6 19. a4 {While I maintain my pawn center and prepare to attack your king-side, I need to prevent any counters on your queen-side. I don't want you to play b5.} Bc6 20. Qd2 Nf8 {(???) Deserting the center. The knight is needed to control e5 and especially to defend c6. As you saw later as I pursued my attack, the knight was needed back on d7. You moved him back on move 24.} 21. h4 {Now I start my plan to get my queen on h6 and hit g6. The pawn push has the twofold purpose: 1. opening h2, so the knight can go to a2, then g4, to support the queen move to h6; 2. Preparing for h5, to attack g6. I mentioned on your move 15, that you need to be careful when pushing pawns in front of your king. Here, my pawn push does not give me any concerns as the pawns on f2 & g2 support the squares e3,f3,g3 & h3. I see no way in for you to attack my king.} b5 {I'm sure you had no idea of the attack I was about launch, or you would not push queenside pawns.} 22. Nh2 Rad8 23. Ng4 Qe7 24. e5 {So this begins a combination to get the knight on to the e5 square. Once there, with no pawns to attack it, he would be a stronghold for the rest of the game. You had no DSB to try to trade off, and your knight has no easy way to attack e5. Your knight is forced back to d7 to defend f6. If instead, you play f5, then Nf6 wins the exchange. After 24.	e5 Nd7 25. Qh6+ Kg8 26. exf6 Nxf6 27. Ne5, the knight has entered your private space, and he'll refuse to leave.} Nd7 25. Qh6+ { } Kg8 26. exf6 Nxf6 27. Ne5 {Now my knight is ideally placed. Unfortunately for you the LSB has no access to defend g6.} Bd7 28. h5 Qg7 {Again view GK's analysis. 28. ... NxP is better.} 29. Qxg7+ Kxg7 30. hxg6 hxg6 31. Bxg6 {Winning a pawn...} Ref8 32. Re3 bxa4 33. Rg3 a3 34. Ra1 Rdb8 {Unprotecting the bishop is disastrous! Always be careful when there are potential discovered checks. The moving piece can go any where and start taking things! With the 2 rooks where they can be forked on d7, you know the bishop on that square is target.} 35. Be8+ {(!)} Kh7 36. Bxd7 Ne4 37. Rh3+ Kg7 38. Bxe6 Nxf2 {So you took a pawn when my knight is threatening to fork your rooks. Your knight is also threatening my rook, but I can check your king to get away, then fork you.} 39. Rg3+ Kh7 40. Nd7 Ne4 41. Nxf8+ {With check so you can't get my rook.} Rxf8 42. Re3 Ng5 43. Bxc4 Kg6 {Thanks for the game Ananya! I hope you got something out of the annotations.  God Bless! Scott}
