1. e4 c5 2. g3 e5 3. Bg2 Nf6 {White opens with a fianchettoed bishop.  Black counters with an assertive opening to dominate the center.} 4. c3 Be7 5. Ne2 O-O 6. O-O {Both sides have setup defensive positions for their kings.} Nc6 7. Na3 b6 8. Re1 Bb7 {Moving the bishop behind the knight seems counter productive.  The knight blocks the bishop, and if the e4 pawn ever moves forward, nothing is protecting the black bishop from its counterpart on g2.} 9. Qc2 d5 {Pawn moves forward into the center.} 10. exd5 Nxd5 {Here the knight moves into a vulnerable spot.  White can bring more pieces to bear on d5 and the only black piece backing it up is the queen.} 11. d4 exd4 12. cxd4 {The last two moves leading up to this capture are good moves by white.  White can now exert influence into the center without pawns in the way.} Rb8 {Instead of recapturing the d4 square, black chose to provide support for the unprotected bishop on b7.} 13. dxc5 Bxc5 {This was the move black was waiting for.  Black wanted the white pawn to take c5 so the bishop could recapture and pins a pawn near the white king.  This crucial move allows for the final attack later in the game.} 14. Rd1 {Yikes!  White has moved another piece to attack the center knight.} Ncb4 {In one move, black provides two more supports for the center knight - and counterattacks white's queen.  Bonus: both of black's bishops have nearly unobstructed lines of attack into white's kingside corner.} 15. Qc4 {White's queen moves to provide another attack on black's center knight.} Qf6 {Black's queen moves into position to take the hapless pawn.  This move takes one line of support off the center knight and effectively offers the knight as bait.} 16. Bxd5 {White takes the bait.} Qxf2+ {Black's queen takes the hapless pawn and makes her real intentions known.} 17. Kh1 {White's only move is to go the corner where ...} Bxd5+ {Black puts him in check again.  White's king can't move so the only defense is to take the bishop by sacrificing a more valuable piece.} 18. Rxd5 {This moves the rook off the backrow so it can no longer protect the king.} Nxd5 19. Qxd5 Qf1+ {The black queen moves into position for the final assault.} 20. Ng1 {Only possible move for white.} Qxg1# {The black queen declares victory!}
