1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 {Queen's pawn, Mason Variation.} e6 {c5 is the Steinitz counter-gambit.  e6 seems like a solid response. } 3. h3 {This seems a little weak; black's knight has not entered the fray.} c5 4. dxc5 Bxc5 5. e3 Ne7 6. Nf3 Nbc6 7. Bb5 a6 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 {Bishop/Knight trade is kind of interesting when it doesn't lead to doubled pawns. } 9. Ne5 f6 10. Nd3 Bd6 11. Bxd6 Qxd6 12. Nc3 Bb7 13. Qg4 O-O 14. Nf4 Bc8 15. O-O {Whoa!  Did white just toss his knight?  e5 puts pressure on the queen.} e5 {Two pieces threatened with a single pawn move.} 16. Qh4 {White's queen chooses to kiss the knight good bye before parting. } Nf5 {Since the bishop is covering the knight, black can take his own sweet time over slaying the white horse. } 17. Qg4 {Oops!  NxPe3 forks the queen and rook.} Nxe3 {Now black has traded up a knight and bishop for a knight and rook AND a pawn.} 18. Qxc8 {...or a knight and bishop for a knight, pawn, and queen. } Raxc8 19. fxe3 exf4 20. Rxf4 Qc5 21. Re1 Rcd8 22. Kh1 {White is preparing to advance the e pawn?  } Rfe8 23. Re2 Rxe3 {Free pawn.} 24. Rxe3 Qxe3 { } 25. Ra4 Qc1+ {Time to molest pawns. } 26. Kh2 Qxb2 27. Rxa6 {??  Ok, maybe that move deserved only one ?, but what does white have against that knight?  Surely the black a pawn couldn't be worth all that.} Qxc3 {}
