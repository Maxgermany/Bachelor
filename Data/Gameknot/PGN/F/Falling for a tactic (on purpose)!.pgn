1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {The Spanish opening - exchange variation.} 5. Nxe5 {Takes the hanging pawn.} Qd4 {This queen move could have been premature - but I liked it because it seemed aggressive.} 6. Nf3 {White moves his knight back...} Qxe4+ {I capture his pawn with check. I can force him to move his king now, preventing castling.} 7. Qe2 {Blocks the check.} Qxe2+ {I exchange, forcing the King to move.} 8. Kxe2 {Forced.} Bg4 {I pin his knight.} 9. Re1 {White prepares to "castle manually", with the threat of a discovered check. } O-O-O {I castle out of the way.} 10. d3 {Opening a line for his bishop.} Nf6 {I develop my knight.} 11. Be3 {Prevents a check on his king. Not sure if this is the best square for the bishop though - ...Re8 pins it.} Bd6 {I connect my rooks by moving my bishop out of the way.} 12. Nbd2 {White develops his knight, protecting against ...Bxf2 followed by the loss of the h2 pawn. Looks quite cramped around his king now.} Rhe8 {I pin white's bishop.} 13. Kf1 {White moves his king out of the way.} Nd5 {I push my knight forward to avoid it being pinned against my rook by Bg5.} 14. Ng5 {Threatening to take one of my pawns (h7 or f7).} f6 {Now if white does take h7, his knight becomes stuck.} 15. Nf7 {So instead he threatens my rook. The knight is unsupported now though.} Rd7 {I hit the knight.} 16. Nxd6+ {White takes my bishop with check.} cxd6 {I capture the knight.} 17. c4 {White hits my knight.} Nb4 {I threaten his pawn on d3 - or to fork his rooks with Nc2.} 18. Bb6 {White threatens mate if I don't watch it... (19. Rxe8+ Rd8 20. Rxd8#)} Rde7 {So I double my rooks.} 19. Rxe7 {He trades.} Rxe7 {But now I have control of the e-file.} 20. f3 {White hits my bishop.} Bf5 {I move to safety.} 21. Ne4 {White threatens my pawn on d6.} Kd7 {I defend it.} 22. Nc5+ {On the surface, this tactic looks like it wins a pawn for white after ...dxc5 (23.) Bxc5... forking my knight and rook. I go along with it, because if you look further there is now a problem for white...} dxc5 {I take the knight.} 23. Bxc5 {White attacks my rook and knight...} Nc2 {But now white's rook is attacked too - and I have his knight for a pawn.} 24. Rc1 {Threatens my knight.} Bxd3+ {I take a pawn with check, and protect my knight too.} 25. Kf2 {Moves out of check.} Re2+ {I check him again, moving my rook to safety.} 26. Kg3 {Moves out of the way.} Re1 {I force a trade of rooks.} 27. Rxe1 {He takes.} Nxe1 {I take back - and I am up in material.} 28. b3 {Attempts to strengthen his pawn structure.} Bb1 {But now my bishop can pick at least one of them off. White graciously resigns. (Based on our relative ratings, white could probably have played on and waited for a mistake on my part!)  Thanks for reading through this game, I hope you enjoyed it.
