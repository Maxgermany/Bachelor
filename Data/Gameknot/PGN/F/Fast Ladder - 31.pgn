1. e4 {Decided to annotate this game because at the time my opponents rating was nearly 1400 and mine was around 1250, I felt I played well to win this one.} e5 2. Nc3 Bb4 3. Nf3 Bxc3 {Wasn't expecting him to do this, I have to double up the pawns but I'm ahead in development.} 4. bxc3 d5 5. d3 dxe4 {Again, 5 moves in and he only has 1 piece out on the board, however I felt it would have been more surprising to do this.} 6. Nxe5 Nf6 7. d4 {Creating a bit of a pawn formation and protecting my knight} Nbd7 8. Bc4 O-O 9. Rb1 {Don't know why I done this perhaps I was thinking ahead to an open file when his lsb was out.} Nxe5 10. dxe5 Qxd1+ {Happy to exchange, feel I'm in a better position at the moment.} 11. Kxd1 Rd8+ 12. Ke2 Bg4+ 13. Ke3 {Not to bothered with moving my king out at this point, plus if I had moved to the 1st row I would have lost my h1 rook.} b6 14. h3 {Don't know why I didn't take the knight.} Be6 15. Bxe6 fxe6 16. f4 {Again, should have taken the knight.} Nd5+ 17. Kd4 Nf6+ 18. Kc4 Nd5 19. g3 c6 20. h4 {Bit of a pawn push towards the king} c5 21. Re1 Nf6 22. exf6 {Going to take up his offer this time!} gxf6 23. Rxe4 {Yummy, free pawn!} Rd6 24. g4 a6 25. f5 e5 26. g5 Kf7 27. Rg4 b5+ 28. Kxc5 {Another freebie.} Rad8 29. h5 Rd6d1 30. g6+ hxg6 31. hxg6+ Kg7 32. Kb6 Rd8d6+ 33. Ka5 Rf1 {This is the move that made my opponent resign} 34. Bh6+ {BOOM! A few mistakes from myself, but all in all I don't think I done to badly.}
