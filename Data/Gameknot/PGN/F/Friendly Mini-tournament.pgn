1. e4 {Standard opening.} e5 {good response} 2. Qf3 {So he is looking for the 4 move mate...to defend against this you either advance your pawn to f6 or your knight to f6} d6 {but not this!. ..Remember, the f7 pawn is the weakest pawn on the board and is often the subject of intense interest by your opponent} 3. Bc4 {SO here, if you missed it so far, you have three options...p-f6, kn-f6 or bishop -e6} Ne7 {but not this, not this at all!} 4. d3 {this was an unnecessary move because the game is over. } Nbc6 {you are still not defending f6!!} 5. Qxf7+ {and this is why you need to!} Kd7 6. Be6# {}
