[White "Fritz 10 "]
[Black "fatcat2 "]
[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence, Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 {If you want the details, this game was a "rated game" played against Fritz's lowest rated game level - which is still quite formidable. I have heard that a good way of beating Fritz is to play a completely positional, tactic-free game.} e5 {I have had bad experiences playing my favourite French Defence against Fritz, and Alekhine's Defence gives me a hard time against anyone, let alone Fritz! These are the only two responses to 1.e4 I have had any significant experience with (and for the record I gave up Alekhine's Defence in June) so I played 1...e5, of which you do not really need so much experience to play competently.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening. This is by far the most common 1.e4 e5 opening at grandmaster levels. Obviously White is putting pressure on Black's e-pawn.} d6 {The oldest response, the Steinitz Defence. I play the Cozio Defence (3...Nge7) more often, but this temporarily compromises Black's dark-squared bishop, giving White a dynamic advantage. I tend to prefer more sedate positions while playing Fritz. The problem with the Steinitz Defence is that it pins Black's developed knight.} 4. d4 exd4 5. Qxd4 {Taking advantage of the pinned knight to bring the queen out.} Bd7 {I try to break the pin on the knight.} 6. Bxc6 {Disconcertingly, Fritz was playing these moves without a second's hesitation, not a single beep of discomfort. My opponent in Game 1, those of you who looked at it will remember, was a rather battered handheld chess device, Star Chess by name - I could easily see when it was uncomfortable with a position by the fact that a little red light started blinking on its side. But what went on in Fritz's silicon chips was unknown to me.} Bxc6 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Bg5 Be7 {Immediately the pin is broken. I have had bad experiences in tournaments when a minor-looking pin festers and eventually causes the collapse of my position, so I usually instinctively break pins as soon as possible.} 9. O-O-O O-O {Castling on opposite sides leads to sharp games, as both sides will often try a pawn storm on the opposing king's position.} 10. Rhe1 Re8 11. Kb1 Ng4 12. Bxe7 Rxe7 {Looking back, probably Qxe7 would have put more pressure on White's e-pawn and have been a better idea.} 13. h4 Nf6 14. e5 Nd7 {Forced into passivity. By now my silicon opponent's position is wide-open and dominant. However, Fritz's speed in moving has slowed down, and has also begun to emit a tiny whirring noise. This is either Fritz needing some more thought or distracting tactics.} 15. exd6 Rxe1 16. Rxe1 cxd6 17. Ng5 Qf6 18. Qd3 {Fritz goes in for the kill! Or not. At the very least he wants to grab material.} g6 19. f3 Nc5 20. Qd2 h6 21. Nxf7 {!? A knight sacrifice for two pawns. I can see no immediate forcing lines, and in any case didn't want to be left minus a pawn, so I accepted the knight...} Kxf7 22. Qxh6 Re8 {Offering up the exchange. Whenever I am ahead on material by, say, a piece for pawns, I automatically go into exchange mode, trying to consolidate my lead by removing pieces from the board.} 23. Rd1 Qg7 {Leaving my d-pawn underprotected, but obviously not en prise, unless White wants to part with his queen :-)} 24. Qg5 Qf6 {Relentlessly pursuing a queen exchange.} 25. Qg3 Re6 26. Qg4 Qf5 27. Qd4 Qe5 28. Qxe5 {Finally, Fritz accepts the exchange. "The hard part is over", I told myself, "I've got the queens off the board, and with my material advantage - a bishop for two pawns - the rest should be easy". Fat chance.} dxe5 29. a3 e4 {Offering up more exchanges.} 30. Nxe4 Nxe4 31. fxe4 Bxe4 {All of which Fritz accepts! This seems to be going perfectly for me!} 32. g4 Bf3 33. Rd7+ Re7 34. Rd4 Re4 {If he goes back to 35.Rd7  I will retreat my king and then win his g-pawn.} 35. Rxe4 Bxe4 {But, instead, my opponent initiates an exchange! Incredible! I am sure this is giving him very little counterplay...} 36. Kc1 g5 {I calculated that if my Fritz decided to accept this temporary sacrifice, I would quickly win both his g- and h-pawns. I hadn't planned for what would happen after 37.h5...} 37. hxg5 {...but, luckily, he doesn't play 37.h5. This could have led to a disaster for Black so I think I was very lucky there!} Kg6 38. c4 Kxg5 39. b4 Kxg4 {BAM!BAM! and the two pawns no longer exist.} 40. Kb2 Kf5 41. Kb3 Ke6 42. a4 Kd6 43. c5+ Kc6 44. Kc3 b5 {Another move similar the recent pawn sacrifice. If cxb6e.p. then Kxb6 and all is fine. 45.a5 also fragments White's pawn structure.} 45. axb5+ Kxb5 46. c6 Kxc6 47. Kb2 Kb5 48. Ka1 Kxb4 {Why is White giving up his pawns without a fight? The answer dawns on me suddenly: The position is irrevocably drawn now. I have the curse of side pawn endgames: the WRONG COLOURED BISHOP. If my bishop was dark-squared, I'd be able to drive Fritz's king out of my pawn's queening square. But, as I don't, this is a draw. I can procrastinate, but... } 49. Ka2 a5 50. Ka1 Bd5 51. Kb1 a4 52. Ka1 a3 53. Kb1 Kb3 54. Ka1 Ka4 55. Kb1 Kb4 56. Ka1 Kb3 57. Kb1 a2+ 58. Ka1 Be4 {...in the end, I can't force Fritz's king out. And he is unlikely to come out willingly, strangely enough. Well, it's not all that bad. I have secured a solid draw as Black, holding my narrow lead against one of my stronger opponents - Fritz 10 is not a battered little handheld device covered in mysterious red lights, unlike my Round 1 opponent! With the score at 1.5 to fatcat2, 0.5 to the Computers, I am optimistic for the next round.}
