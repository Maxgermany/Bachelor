[Opening "King's Indian (A48), East Indian defence"]

1. d4 Nf6 {Team Match, I'm playing black. My opponent opens with his queen's pawn, so I go Indian.} 2. Nf3 g6 {The usual 2nd move for white is 2. c4 to grab as much of the center as possible. 2. Nf6 leads to the Torre Attack or the Barry Attack, neither of which I have any documentation for. So, back to winging it, with the GK DB for guidance, such as it were, so I'm looking at a King's Indian sort of hypermodern defense despite the difference in white's play, at least until I have to really wing it.} 3. e3 d6 4. h3 Bg7 {Basic stuff.} 5. Bd3 O-O 6. O-O c5 {Challenging white's center.} 7. c3 Nc6 8. Nbd2 Bd7 {Indecisive. This bishop might want to play on either side, so d7 gives him options.} 9. b3 a6 10. Ba3 Qa5 {Premature. White is attacking the black pawn on c5, and from here the black queen can defend c5 while attacking the white bishop on a3. But she won't get to stay here. I thought she would drive away the bishop before she was driven away herself, but I overlooked white's simple response. I'll put a ? on 10. ... Qa5?.} 11. Nc4 Qc7 12. dxc5 d5 {White has gained a pawn thanks to black's sloppy 10. ... Qa5? move. Time to try to regain a little control, or at least regain a little equality.} 13. Nb6 Rad8 {Again, not what I had in mind. Not exactly a bad move, but when I played 12. ... d5, I had thought to drive the white knight back into white's territory rather than deeper into black's.} 14. Nxd7 Nxd7 {Down a pawn and allowing easy exchanges that favor white. I need to start playing sharper or this one will end badly. Recapturing with the knight opens up the long diagonal for black's fianchettoed bishop on g7 to attack the undefended white pawn on c3.} 15. Qc2 Qa5 {Back she goes, but this time it's not premature. The black queen forks three white targets: the bishop on a3, the pawn on c3, and the pawn on c5. White can only save two of them. 16. Bb4? loses a piece to 16. ... Nxb4.} 16. Bb2 Qxc5 {Not 16. ... Nxc5? because of 17. b4.} 17. b4 Qd6 18. b5 axb5 {White chooses to mess up the queen side. After 18. ... axb5 or 19. bxa3, either way, both players have isolated queenside pawns.} 19. Bxb5 Qc5 {The queen returns to c5 with a new threat, and no white pawn to drive her off.} 20. Bd3 e5 {Wanting to play 21. ... e4.} 21. e4 dxe4 {But white beat me to it.} 22. Bxe4 Nb6 23. a4 Nc4 {Hunting bishops.} 24. Bxc6 Qxc6 {One came to me.} 25. Rfc1 Rdc8 26. Nd2 Nxb2 {Bagged the other one.} 27. Qxb2 e4 {At this point, I am a little at a loss. Black had a scare there, losing a pawn, but he quickly got it back and now things look fairly even. The openness of the position seems to favor black's bishop a little more than white's knight, and black has only one isolated pawn to white's two. Minor advantages to be sure, and I have little idea how to exploit them. So I started by putting another attacker on white's isolated pawn at c3.} 28. Ra3 Rfd8 {Rook on the open file.} 29. Nb1 Rc7 {might need to double rooks sometime soon.} 30. Qc2 Bf8 31. Ra2 Bc5 32. Re1 e3 {Time to be tricky with a very short-term sacrifice; black plans to get the pawn back. I don't expect much here, other than to break up white's castle a bit. It seems the black pieces can get aggressive kingside faster than the white pieces can get defensive.} 33. fxe3 Re8 34. Qd3 Rd7 {34. ... Rce7 eventually wins the isolated white pawn too, but this is better. White's queen has nowhere to run that defends e3 and doesn't block the white rook on a2 from rushing over to defend.} 35. Qf1 Rxe3 {White abandons the pawn and now black recaptures with multiple threats. First, the black rook on e3 can go anywhere with impunity by unmasking a discovered check from black's bishop on c5.} 36. Rxe3 Re7 {I liked the threats with my rook on e3 so much that I decided not to recapture right away. With 36. ... Re7! black can get his other rook onto e3.} 37. Kh1 Rxe3 {White may have been better served by 37. Re2, practically forcing black to trade off all the remaining rooks. Instead, he abandoned his doomed rook and gets his king off the black bishop's diagonal. Black is only too happy to reestablish his threats with the rook on e3, even more dangerous now that black's g2 pawn is pinned to his king.} 38. Qc1 Rxh3# {Black missed the threat with 38. Qc1???. This game had been close and well played by both sides such that I almost regretted playing black's final move. But a win is a win, and after playing several sloppy moves this game and jeopardizing black's chances of winning, I'm just glad to get the win. Besides, this game concludes a St. Patrick's Day hat trick - three wins on the holiday.}
