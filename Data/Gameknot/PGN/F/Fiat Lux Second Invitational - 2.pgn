1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {Ponziani opening.} Nf6 {Jaenish counter attack.} 4. d3 d5 5. exd5 Qxd5 6. c4 Qd8 7. Nc3 Bc5 8. Be3 Bxe3 9. fxe3 O-O 10. e4 Nd4 11. Nxd4 Qxd4 12. Qf3 Bg4 13. Qg3 Be6 14. Be2 Qb6 15. b3 Qb4 16. Kd2 a5 17. Rhf1 a4 18. a3 Qxb3 {Qd6 instead sets up a nice knight fork.  Does the queen have any escape route here if white plays Rfb1?} 19. Rfb1 Nxe4+ 20. dxe4 Rfd8+ {Black had to sacrifice a knight to create the escape route, but it looks like this worked.} 21. Ke1 {...temporarily.} Qc2 22. Bd1 {Ra2 I think would have forced that queen rook trade.  Knight covers both rooks, queen protects knight.  That would block Qd2+.} Qd2+ 23. Kf1 Bxc4+ 24. Kg1 Rd3 25. Qxe5 {White is going to regret that pawn.  Ph3 opens an escape hatch for the white king.} Qe3+ 26. Kh1 Qe1# {}
