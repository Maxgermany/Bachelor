[Opening "Dutch defence (A84)"]

1. d4 {This is my latest battle against kaboes, who, as I write, is currently 2nd in the Fast Ladder.  I'm 71st.  My record hitherto against him doesn't look bad but I think all my wins came relatively early in our history.  Anyway, looking for a hoick up the ladder, I decide to play a solid opening...  This commentary was written before reading the computer analysis.  I've then added computer commentary.  I think this demonstrates that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time!} f5 {The dreaded Dutch, his favourite response, against which I have not done well.} 2. c4 Nf6 3. Bg5 {I look to disrupt his opening as much as possible with this potential pin of the N against Q, discouraging the Black e-pawn from moving, or so I think.} e6 {So much for that theory!} 4. Nf3 Be7 5. e3 d6 {Both sides have played natural developing moves so far.  This pawn prevents my N from going to e5.} 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. Bd3 h6 {At last Black challenges the intrusive prelate.} 8. Bxf6 {I didn't fancy the prospect fo a pawn storm trapping the B on g3, so swapped immediately.} Bxf6 {Now Black has the advantage of the bishop pair} 9. O-O g5 {Here come the pawns anyway.  This seems to be easier for Black to achieve with the Dutch than with, say, the King's Indian, since Black doesn't have to muck about with his KN to enable his f-pawn to advance.  The computer prefers 9...0-0} 10. d5 {White counter-thrusts in the centre, as advised in all good chess primers :-)} Ne5 {...but every pawn move leaves two squares that were previously defended undefended.  So Black hops his N onto one of them.} 11. Nd4 {Spotting the opportunity to plant my N on e6, I sidestep Black's offer to swap.} Nxd3 {Now Black takes the opportunity to make it 2 Bishops against 2 Knights.  Which is better in this position?} 12. Qxd3 Bxd4 {Clearly Black doesn't like that balance...} 13. Qxd4 {?!  The computer calls this an inaccuracy, preferring 13. exd4.  I remember debating with myself how to recapture but I don't remember this line, given by the computer:  Best: +0.72 » 13. exd4  O-O  14. Rae1 Re8  15. f4 Kg7  16. Rf2 Bd7  17. Rfe2 Qf6  18. dxe6 Rxe6  19. Nd5 Rxe2  20. Rxe2} e5 14. Qd2 a6 15. Rae1 Qf6 16. f3 {Around about here, I remember trying to calcualte the pros and cons of each kingside pawn move.  No advance to the 4th rank seemed to help me, so I settled for this more flexible option.} Bd7 {Black develops his last minor piece and appears to threaten either to castle queenside, having ruined his kingside, or to try to undermine White's pawns with ...b5} 17. a4 {So I demonstrated against the queenside, discouraging ..b5 and preparing an attack on the castled king's position if he went long.} O-O-O 18. b4 {Now it was my turn to launch a pawn storm :-)} b6 {? I didn't realise this at the time, but the computer suggests that this is a mistake, suggesting I respond with 19. Ra1, not an obvious move to a human after recently centralising the rook.  It prefers ...Rdg8:  Mistake: +1.33 » … b6  18. Ra1 Kb7  19. a5 Rhg8  20. b5 Ra8  21. axb6 axb5  22. bxc7 Rxa1  23. Rxa1 bxc4  24. Qe2 Kxc7  25. Qxc4+ Best: +0.21 » … Rdg8 18. e4 g4 19. Qe3 gxf3 20. Rxf3 Qg5 21. Qxg5 Rxg5 22. h4 Rh5 23. exf5 Rxf5 24. Kf2} 19. c5 {?!  Onwards and upwards!  But, of course, the computer calls this an inaccuracy} dxc5 20. bxc5 bxc5 {Now there's an empty file for me to try to exploit.} 21. Reb1 Bc6 {Black, in turn, exploits the pin against my undefended Queen to protect b7} 22. Qd3 {Moving the Q off the d-file would have sacrificed the d-pawn but I couldn't see a mating attack that would have made it worthwhile and Black's Q defended the Rh8 which might otherwise have been picked up after 22. Qb2 Bxd5 23. Nxd5 Rxd5 24. Qb8+ Kd7.  I don't remember considering the possibility I've just seen now, though, of 24. Qb7+ Kd8 or Kd7 25. Qxd5+.  Black would not, therefore, have been able to respond with Bxd5, so probably 22. Qb2 would have been stronger here.  22...Rxd5 would have sacrificed the exchange for the sake of defending b7.  It will be interestign to see the computer's take on this.} Bb7 {Black defends a6.} 23. e4 {and White defends d5 ...} f4 {releasing f4 to Black's pawn, which solidifies the kingside somewhat, leaving White free rein to attack.} 24. Rb2 {White prepares to double on the b-file.  The computer calculates my advantage as +1.47 at this point.} c6 {?? I thought this move unremarkable but the computer calls it a blunder:  Blunder: +5.77 » … c6  24. Rfb1 c4  25. Qxc4 Ba8  26. Qxa6+ Kd7  27. dxc6+ Ke8  28. Rb8 Bxc6  29. Rxd8+ Kxd8  30. Qa7 Bd7  31.

I've never seen a score of +24.42 before!  I thought it was OK myself but obviously I'd failed to spot the power of 25. Rxb7.  Blunder: +24.42 » … Rd7  25. Rxb7 Qd6  26. Qxa6 Kd8  27. Qa8+ Ke7  28.

Nd5 Ra7 32. Nc7+ Rxc7 33. Qxc7} 26. Qc4 {??  White finally releases the pin and threatens Black's doubled c-pawn, I wrote, before seeing the computer's analysis.  The computer's score of +6.89 represents White's high water mark in this game:  Blunder: +6.89 » 26.  Qc4  cxd5  27. Nxd5 Qf7  28. Nb6+ Kd8  29. Qxc5 Rd3  30. Qxe5 Re8  31. Qb8+ Ke7  32.

I wrote before seeing the computer analysis.  I should have stuck to my convictions and gone for it:  Blunder: +1.32 » 27.  Rd1  Rhd8  28. dxc6 Qxc6  29. Nd5 Qd6  30. Kf2 Kb8  31.

Now there are all sorts of possibilities in the air.  White has a potential revealed attack on Black's Q but the two squares where the N can check from are both covered by the Q and the Rd1 is undefended.  After the game, kaboes stated that he thought I could have done better from the Q and R swaps that follow, so perhaps 29. Nb6+ would have been better?  29... Qxb6 and if 30.

Black has the advantage (-3.31 according to the computer).} 36. Kf1 {Into the queening square.} Kb6 {Now the computer scores it -5.98.  The increasing score without comment probably indicating its short event horizon.} 37. Ke1 Ka5 {Black single-mindedly hunts down White's wide pawn.} 38. Kd2 Kxa4 39.
