1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 8. Bd3 Bb7 {A main line of the semi-slav: meran system.} 9. Bd2 {not a common move. Usually white plays e4, or castles here. Bd2 is poor because it blacks lines, moves the bishop to a useless square, and delays other moves that could be better timed.} a6 {Solidifying the b-pawn, in preperation to play c5.} 10. e4 c5 11. O-O c4 {This is usually against the ideas in the semi-slav, but white's slow play makes it possible. Although I give white a strong center, he can't take advantage of this with his lack of space for his pieces. So i go after the e-pawn with a queenside storm, to remove the defenders.} 12. Bc2 b4 13. Na4 Nxe4 14. Re1 Nxd2 15. Nxd2 Rc8 16. b3 {A poor move} c3 {Now my pawns cramp white's space an incredible amount. I also have a protected passed pawn, which is very good in an endgame.} 17. Nc4 Qg5 {It's time to take advantage of white's problems with a kingside attack. His pieces are uncoordinated, not attacking, and not around his king. That seems to be all I need to know! I threaten mate in one with Qxg2} 18. g3 Nf6 {I have plenty of time to attack, white's pieces aren't coming into the picture very quickly.} 19. Nab6 {A waste .. I wish to play Rd8 anyway.} Rd8 20. h4 {Weakening the kingside even more...} Qb5 21. Qd3 Bc5 {Develop with a threat!} 22. a4 Qc6 23. d5 Nxd5 24. Nxd5 Rxd5 25. Qe4 Qc7 {Do you see the threats? A crushing discovery by moving the rook, or Qxg3+!} 26. Qg4 O-O 27. Ne3 {Tsk .. now I get the second rank for my attack as well.} Rd2 28. Rac1 {Trying to hold material desperately..} Qc6 29. f3 f5 30. Qf4 Rd4 {The queen is trapped, and white's king has a very very grim future. White resigns}
