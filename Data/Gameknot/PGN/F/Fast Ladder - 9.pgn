1. d4 d5 {As I'm a lot more familiar with 1. e4 e5 (as White or Black) I'm sticking with: 1. ... d5 } 2. c4 dxc4 {Likewise I almost always accept the Queen's Gambit.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. a4 c6 5. Nc3 Bf5 6. Bf4 e6 7. e3 Nd5 8. Nxd5 cxd5 9. Be2 Bb4+ {I was hoping I might be able to prevent White from castling, and if not at least develop some pieces.} 10. Nd2 Qa5 11. e4 Bxe4 {11. e4 seemed like a free Pawn so I took it.} 12. O-O Bg6 {I don't see any benefit in allowing an exchange of Bishop for a Knight at this point.} 13. b3 c3 {I don't think it likely that I can promote this Pawn, but at least White has another threat to deal with.} 14. Nf3 c2 15. Bb5+ {I overlooked this possibility.} Nc6 16. Qe2 O-O 17. Bd3 Bxd3 18. Qxd3 Bc3 {I want to keep White under pressure. I'm planning: 19. Rac1 Bb2 20. Rxc2 Nb4 forking White's Queen and Rook. But...} 19. Rac1 Bb2 20. Rxc2 Nb4 21. Qd2 {Now my (Black) Knight is pinned and my DSB is in trouble.} Ba3 22. Rc5 Qd8 {I want to put my Queen somewhere where it will suffer the least further molestation in the hopes of saving my Knight and DSB.} 23. Ne5 b6 {I want to create a safe haven for my Knight at a6, then I'll be able to retreat my DSB.} 24. Nc6 Nxc6 25. Rxc6 Rc8 {I don't want White to get the c-File or the 7-Rank.} 26. Rxc8 Qxc8 27. Qd3 Be7 {My a-Pawn and b-Pawn are looking vulnerable but at least my DSB is safe for now.} 28. Qg3 Bf6 {28. Qg3 threatens 29. Bh6 and then either checkmate or the loss of my Rook for White's DSB. Fortunately for me I've seen it before.} 29. Rc1 Qa6 30. Be5 Bxe5 31. Qxe5 Qd3 {If White's not careful I might get a Back Rank Mate.} 32. g3 Qxb3 {Getting rid of White's a-Pawn and b-Pawn would give me a (distant) threat against White.} 33. Qc7 Qxa4 34. Qb7 {It looks like White wants to get me with a Back Rank Mate.} g6 35. Rc8 Rxc8 {I think my position is stronger without the Rooks on the board, and my King should be t least temporarily safe from the White Queen on g7.} 36. Qxc8+ Kg7 37. Qc3 a5 {It's easier for my queen to defend b6 than a7.} 38. f4 Qb4 39. Qxb4 axb4 {I wasn't expecting an exchange of Queens.}
