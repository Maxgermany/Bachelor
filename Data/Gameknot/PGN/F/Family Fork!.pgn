1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This game got off to another slow start for me, but later on in the game, white overlooked a knight fork winning the exchange.  This was not a family fork, that came later and finished off my opponent at the end.  The first mistake, however, put this skids right on.  So how did this happen?  Well, read on.  Here is the computer analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16201874&fb=1&rnd=0.03848212663100348.  The first four moves are the main line Ruy Lopez.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. Qe2 {5. Qe2 - unusual.} b5 {5. ...... b5 - might as well drive white back.} 6. Bb3 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. c3 d6 {8. ..... d3 - time for some quiet line-opening development.} 9. d4 Bg4 {9. ...... Bg4 - pin.} 10. Rd1 exd4 11. cxd4 {11. cxd4 - pawn trade.} d5 12. e5 Ne4 {12. ..... Ne4 - I decided to make use of a temporary outpost for my knight as it will take a few moves for white to give a possible f3.  I did think for one horrible moment that BxP would remove the rampant knight's protector and it would be zapped by the Wicked Witch of the West, but never fear, d5 is also defended by Glenda!} 13. Be3 Na5 14. Bc2 f5 {14. ..... f5 - bolsters my knight.} 15. h3 Bh5 16. b3 b4 {16. ..... b4 - exerts a cramp on c3 and a3 and the only way the white QKt can get to is d2.  He does move his knight to d2 but allows ......} 17. Nbd2 {12. Nbd2?? ...... wait for it ......} Nc3 {17. ..... Nc3 - ..... a knight fork!  Now, one move previously it looked as though that fork was not possible as the b1 knight was defending c3.  As it is no longer defending that square I take full advantage of this fact.} 18. Qd3 Nxd1 19. Bxd1 {19. Bxd1 - so now I am the exchange up, Eureka!} f4 {19. ..... f4 - another Eureka moment, white's dsb is trapped and my pawn takes advantage of that and now I am rook for pawn up, double Eureka!} 20. Bxf4 Rxf4 21. Bc2 Bg6 {21. .... Bg6 - and white is gonna lose yet more wood!} 22. Qe3 {22. Qe3 - the Witch attacks my rook but here comes a desperado.} Rxf3 23. Nxf3 Bxc2 {23. ..... Bxc2 (LPDO) - loose pieces drop off.} 24. Rc1 Bg6 25. e6 {25. e6 - white ain't gonna wave that white flag yet.  He tries to counter-attack with a central passer.  I must remain alert.} Qd6 {25. ...... Qd6 - Glenda moves off her home square and immediately puts pressure on that passer.} 26. Re1 Re8 {26. ..... Re8 - it is always a good idea to put your rook in line with the enemy queen.  Leaves open a lot of pinning possibilities.  If you have your queen in line with an enemy rook - beware!} 27. Nd2 Nc6 {27. ..... Nc6 - eyeing up d8 for pile-on purposes.  That knight is destined for far better things, however.} 28. Nf3 Bf6 {28. ..... Bf6 - not much to do except put pressure on d4 and open up another attacker on e6.} 29. g3 Be4 {29. ...... Be4 - that e6 pawn has been cut off from its defenders and it is not long for this world - so it seems - but incredibly that pawn survives the rest of the game albeit looking extremely forlorn!} 30. Ng5 {30. Ng5?? - only because of this move!} Bxg5 {30. .... Bxg5 - I have something up my sleeve ...... wait for it ......} 31. Qxg5 {31. Qxg5 ..... wait for it ......} Nxd4 {31. ....... Nxd4.  Now!!!  White does wave the white flag because a family fork is threatened.  Do you see where?  Either the Wicked Witch or white's remaining rook must drop should white move his king to f1.  White is already 6 points down in material and is about to lose a shedload more.  I would think even the Master Mater had this position against me (I wish!) he would not want to continue here.  Anyhow, I may have another game for you on the theme of knight forks coming up but that one is still in play so it is another case of watch this space.  Anyhow - hope you all have a nice evening - bye for now - Joanne}
