1. e4 {An interesting mating theme I found among friends. } c5 2. f4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 {Pretty unusual all the opening... nice and tactics are coming... :-)} 4. Nc3 Nc6 {It is surely bad to exchange the dsb, but in this case it has two interesting conuntersides: if white goes d2xc3 leaves the two pawns alone. Yes they are strong, but will they survive the midgame? If bxc3, white has a strong center, but on the other side has no really safe castling either side. Just wondering. Of course the text move is perfectly ok. } 5. Bb5 Nd4 {White's bishop's "sortie" wasn't a lucky one because of this move, in my opinion. } 6. O-O Nxb5 7. Nxb5 d5 {Black's open lines are more active than white's, so it's ok to open up the game. By the other side, d6 instead won't have been bad. The white knight will lose a move to return where it belongs, and black is shielded. If white goes e5, the exchanges (forced) won't leave black in a bad position - with equality (if I'm not wrong!). } 8. exd5 {It seems much safer to play e5, blocking the dsb. There are still 2 pawns in the way of black's. Black wont' fall in the Qxd5 trap, but can play the nasty Qb6, with serious threats.  } a6 9. Nc3 Nf6 {Black preferred to secure his king instead of the "adventure" Qb6 (after Nc3 is impossible due to Na4). } 10. d4 {Whte gives up the lost e5, but threats c5. Not good for black to take 10... cxd4 because of 11. Qxd4, and the knight f6 is pinned to the bishop (Nh4 will save it, but will leave the knight out of the center.  10... Nxd5 will lead to massive exchanges. After them, white can end up with a doubled c pawn (BxN somewhere) or even tripled (if dxc5) :-) 10... Nxd5, 11. dxc5? NxNc3, 12. QxQ+, KxQ, 13. Rd1+, Kc7, 14. bxNc3 (virtually forced) Bxc3, 15. Rb1, b5, with a better position for black, I believe.  So, in my opinion, 10... Nxd5 was ok. } c4 {Black again surprises me :-) No hurry to take d5, better try to block a little white's already cramped position. But overlooks white's next move: } 11. Qe2 {Now, Nxd5 is countered by Re1 and black cannot castle (NxN, QxN, Qxe7).} b5 {Yes, but losing a fatal tempo to castle and defend e7. Better was to leave the pawn to white: 11... o-o and if 12. Qxc5, Bd7 threatening Bb4 will keep on the fight. Bd7 cannot be played right now because of d6! } 12. Re1 {As predicted. Now, black is squeezed. } Bb7 {I would have considered Bg5, with the idea of BxN. Black needs to defend e7 in order to castle, and maybe even Ra7 would have been thinkable. } 13. f5 {White goes sidewalking, with a meaningful surprise. No tricks over there anyway. Black's defence holds, and d5 seems lost. But black has a surprise by his side...} b4 {It looks that white should have lost a tempo with a3 before adventuring f5.} 14. fxg6 {...and now black must be a good boy and play hxg7, and white has to run with his knight (eg. Ne4), and black would take d5 with good chances. But no...} bxc3 {A piece is a piece, but it was obvious white should have made some calculations before leaving it to you. This was a "I bet you're wrong" moves... :-)} 15. gxf7+ Kf8 {Kxc7, Qd6+ followed by Ng5 and white's attack is a win.} 16. bxc3 Bxd5 17. Ng5 Rb8 {Black covers a possible white Rb1, but a move has to be used to take care of white's control of the kingside. If not inmediately h6, or at least Qd7, in order to cover d6 along with the bishop. In case of Nd6+, BxN, QxB, QxQ, RxQ and holds. Or Bxc7 - ok, you lose your beloved lsb, your best piece, but against the fatal pawn on c7 and black can try Ra7 then.  Of course white has Rb1! But white has an even better move: } 18. Ba3 {This was unstoppable. And definitory.} Rb7 19. Rab1 Rd7 {After Qd7, RxR, QxR, white wins with Bxe7+.  } 20. Rb8 {Naturally. Black cannot lose a single e7 defender. A "small" underestimaion of white's attack on the e column, and an overconfident "grab it" by black caussed him to lose the game. Well won, a_random_guy! But another mating squence is possible (thank you randomguy) 20.Qxe7+! Rxe7 21.Bxe7+ Qxe7 22.Rb8+ Ne8 23.Rxe8+ Qxe8 24.Rxe8#  this one is really, really nice!}
