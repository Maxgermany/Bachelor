[White "Bobby Fischer "]
[Black "Raymond Allen Weinstein "]
[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C88), closed, Leonhardt variation"]

1. e4 {1963, 2 American masters play against each other. I'm not sure which tournament they play in.} e5 {Pretty common.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez. There are many variations including d6, f5 nf6 and bc4. Weinstein responds with this pawn push.} a6 {The pawn push is the most common way of meeting the Ruy Lopez. It is known as the Morphy defense and the idea is pretty simple. Since white can't capture the e4 pawn immediately blaack will try to kick off the bishop and play b5 if needed.} 4. Ba4 {Ba4 is the retreat variation. It is the most popular variation. The other variation is the exchange variation which is aimed to damage the pawn structure of black but white ends up exchanging his most powerful minor piece for it.} Nf6 {These are pretty standard moves. I guess this could be also called the Berlin defense deferred?} 5. O-O {Black has a choice here. Black can either play 5. ... Nxe4 and play the open variation or Be7 which is the closed variation.} Be7 6. Re1 {I forgot about the Marshall counter-attack. Can someone tell me?   This move Re1 protects the pawn and threaten to grab the e5 pawn with Bxc6 and the Nxe4.} b5 {This move kicks the bishop back.} 7. Bb3 {Only move. If FIscher wanted to he could've played Bxb5 but i'm sure that he wouldn't. This square is also a powerful place for the bishop where it strikes f7 and d5.} d6 {Protects the pawn if the centre is ripped with d4.} 8. c3 {Provides an escape square for the bishop incase off Na5 and reinforces the d4 thrust.} O-O {Finally black castles.} 9. h3 {A silent move. This prevents Bg4. Although the pin isn't too effective, it would discourage d4 because white would have doubled pawns on the f file if he wanted to keep a pawn. It also would damage whites pawn structure.} Na5 {Attack the light squared bishop and prepare for a c5 thrust. Nowadays you usually see black play Nb8 trying to reroute the knight.} 10. Bc2 {Only square.} c5 {Clamps down on the d4 square.} 11. d4 {Black could play anything. It is msot logical to take with the because black doesn't want to give up a central pawn so early in the game.} cxd4 12. cxd4 {Black doesn't want to play exd4 because it's going to leave too many weaknesses and he's going to get crushed.} Bb7 {Weinstein plays this incredible move Bb7. It's temporarily sacrficing a pawn.  If 13. dxe5 dxe5 14. Nxe5 , White is up a pawn temporarily but...  14. ....  Qxd1 15. Rxd1 then Bxe4. Regardless of whichever piece white recapture with on move 15, black will regain the pawn. Fischer however, being the chess master who plays different moves played} 13. d5 {d5! Closes up the position and gives white a REAL advantage.} Bc8 {Although this move looks like a waste of time it isn't. Whites bishop on b7 won't do much as the pawn structure is locked. He'll try to put his bishop on a better square.} 14. Nbd2 {It protects c4 and develops.} g6 {I don't know about this move. Maybe it was to prevent a knight coming onto f5 but he has a bishop.} 15. b4 {Strange move. It attacks the knight and gains space on the Queenside.} Nb7 {Only available square. If Nc4 then Bd3 or b3 .} 16. a4 {Shattering blacks pawn structure immediately!. If taken white will have more of an advantage.} Bd7 {Defends the pawn. } 17. axb5 axb5 {Why not take with the bishop? I suppose he didn't want to tie down the bishop to a6.} 18. Rxa8 Qxa8 19. Re3 {Trying to swing the rook over to a3 where it'll attack the queen.} Qc8 {Black doesn't want to be attacked with TEMPO and so moves his queen onto a open file.} 20. Ra3 {White grabs the open file and can play Ra7 infiltrating blacks queenside.} Qc7 {A weird move at first but the idea was to get the rook active.} 21. Nb3 {Making way for the bishop.} Nh5 {Black can adapt to a Kings Indian style and play f5.} 22. Bd3 {Attacks the pawn on b5.} Rc8 {CLaiming the c file.} 23. Qf1 {Attacks the b pawn a second time.} Nf6 {Attakcs the e4 pawn and can regain the pawn if b5 is taken.} 24. Bg5 {Pins the knight.} Rb8 {Trying to support the b5 pawn once the knight moves. This also is a trap. IF   25. Bxb5 Bxb5 26. Qxb5 then Nc3 which attack the queen and pawn. It also defends the e7 bishop and black can freely take on e4 with a winning position!} 25. Ra7 {But Fischer isn't stupid.} Qd8 {Gets himself out of the pin.} 26. Qa1 {Doubling up I guess?} Qe8 {Black has moved his queen a lot of times and has lost tonnes of tempo.} 27. Qa6 {Threaten to capture the knight.} Qc8 28. Nxe5 {Ingenious move! If dxe5 then Bxf6 and white will be a pawn up abd in a winning position.} dxe5 29. Bxf6 Bxf6 30. Qxf6 Qc3 {Black has some counterplay. It temporarily forks the knight and the bishop.} 31. Nc5 {Guards the bishop while attacking blacks bishop and knight. Fischer } Nxc5 32. bxc5 {White crashes through and can threaten Qxf7.} Be8 {The only way to protect the bishop and prevent mate.} 33. Bf1 Qxc5 {Material is now equal although white has a crushing attack. Attacks the rook and prepares the queen to come back and defend.} 34. Re7 {Protects the rook and prepare to roll the d pawn.} b4 {Black deperately tries to queen. He's already in a losing position so he needs some form of counterplay.} 35. d6 Qc6 36. Bb5 {Bc4 is crushing with a decisive threat:   37.  Bxe8 then Bxf7 38. Qxf7 Kh8 and Qg7#   So instead of facing checkmate, Weinstein resigned. He's had enough.   What a brilliant game by Fischer! Notice how Fischer uses all his pieces for the attack, not just a few.}
