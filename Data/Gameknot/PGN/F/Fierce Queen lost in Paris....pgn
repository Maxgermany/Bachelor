1. e4 e6 {up until this game, I never took the French Defense very seriously; most theory I fathomed, came from Blitz experience... this game opened my eyes for good; by now, I know better......} 2. Nf3 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. d4 Nge7 6. Be3 {without Qb6, this move is still playable and part of the theoretical setup... best here though is Bd3; also theory...} Nf5 7. Bd3 Nxe3 8. fxe3 Qb6 9. b3 Bd7 10. O-O f6 11. a4 a6 12. exf6 gxf6 13. a5 Nxa5 14. dxc5 Bxc5 15. Nd4 Nc6 16. Qh5+ {up until now, I was under the impression I was doing rather nicely against this 2350+ giant... but that would soon change...} Ke7 17. Qh6 {after the game - I lost in the end - I found Qh4... that move is much better...} Raf8 18. Kh1 Nxd4 19. exd4 Bxd4 20. Bxa6 Be5 21. Bd3 {by now, Black is clearly better... but what went wrong? (note: 17. Qh6 went wrong: Qh4 would have still rendered control over d4, as wel as f6)} Qxb3 22. Ra3 Qb2 23. Re1 Rfa8 24. Rxa8 Rxa8 25. c4 Ra2 26. Qg7+ Kd6 27. cxd5 exd5 28. Qf8+ Kc6 29. Qg8 {slowly, but surely White is losing control; maybe better here, but also losing is Bf1... the loss of control over d4 on move 17 proved deadly; lessons learned...} Kb6 {Bh3 is even stronger...} 30. Rg1 Bd4 31. Re1 Ka7 {ending it all for White...} 32. h3 Qf2 {Bxh3 is winning instantly...} 33. Rf1 Qe3 34. Qxh7 {the last resort...} Bb5 {the killer move...} 35. Qh4 {Bxb5 leads to mate after Qg3...} Bxd3 {it is over; White resigned...}
