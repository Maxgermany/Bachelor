1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Hope you have enjoyed looking through Part 1 - I thought I would again try out the black side of the Fried Liver Attack against Ion (interestingly enough the rating differentials are similar here to the ones in the Fried Pt 1 Brandon game) to see if I could improve upon it.  No such luck!  Joanne} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7. Qf3+ Ke6 8. Nc3 Nce7 {8. ........ Nce7 - all moves up to here are the same as Fried Pt 1.  Ion now deviates with 9. d4 instead of Qe4.} 9. d4 c6 10. Bg5 h6 11. Bxe7 Bxe7 12. dxe5 Rf8 {12. ....... Rf8 - now I am wondering whether I should have played b5 here.} 13. Qe4 Rf5 14. f4 b5 {14. ....... b5? - it is to be noted that rt4sm (Bob) played this move here against a guy called valeriuzaharia.  He lost but in the final position he had two rooks against a Q   2 pawns.  Hmm, might have played on there.  Valeriuzaharia merely backed off his bishop to b3 but Ion had a much stronger continuation - 15.g4.  In retrospect I should have played h5 first to prevent g4 therefore preparing b5.} 15. g4 Bh4+ {15. ......... Bh4  - this check makes room for Henry to go to e7.  Ion puts his king on e2 and I now back off my rook to f7 defending g7 against a possible check on g6 by the Wicked Witch of the West.  But Ion has a much stronger continuation ............} 16. Ke2 Rf7 17. Nxd5 {17. Nxd5!! - please see my next note.   It could well have been so easy for Ion to have gone wrong here, for instance:- 17. Qg6  Ke7  18. Qxc6?? Bxg4   19. Kf1 Rxf4   20. Kg1 Bf2   21. Kg2 Ne3# - but this didn't happen - sigh! } bxc4 {17. .......... bxc4 - had a choice here, knight or bishop.  I will drop material whichever way I go but I think this is the lesser of the two evils - I may end up with 2 pieces for R   3 pawns, which may still favour white.} 18. f5+ Kd7 19. e6+ {19. e6  - but I have just seen a much stronger continuation to my note above.   19. e6  Kd6  20. Nb4 Kc7  21. exf7   20. Nb4 threatens Rd1  skewering both majesties Henry   Glenda!  There is no time to get the rook out of the way, so my rook on f7 drops for nothing.  I therefore decided to wave the white flag.  So, should the move 5. ......... Nxd5 be awarded the chessic equivalent of the skull   crossbones (??).  You the jury decide. }
