[Opening "Hippopotamus defence (B00)"]

1. e4 {This is the first correspondence chess game that I have won. Looking back, it was actually shorter than I remember it. } Nh6 {At the time, this was my favorite opening as Black, a variation of the Hippopotamus Opening. It allows White a good control over the center and Black good defense and a castled King with hopes of counter-attack on the center.} 2. d4 g6 3. e5 {3. c4 is what I expected. } f6 4. exf6 exf6 {Now my Kingside has two gaping holes.} 5. Qe2+ Be7 {I would rather my Bishop be on g7. } 6. Nc3 g5 {I do not remember why I did this move. Developing or 6. ... 0-0 would have been stronger.} 7. Nf3 c6 8. g3 O-O 9. b3 Re8 {Planning to pin the Queen to his King.} 10. Bh3 {Oblivious.} Bb4 11. Bd2 Rxe2+ 12. Nxe2 Bxd2+ 13. Kxd2 d5 {Freeing my White Bishop and attacking his.} 14. Bxc8 Qxc8 15. h4 {Stopping Qh3. } g4 16. Ne1 Na6 17. Nf4 c5 18. dxc5 Qxc5 19. Ke2 Nb4 20. Ne6 {This begins his Checkmate Ceremony.} Re8 21. Nd3 Rxe6+ 22. Kd1 {Kd1?? Kf1 would have saved him.} Qxc2# {I hope you enjoyed! Please comment and rate. Thanks to Knackers for this great game!}
