[Opening "Sicilian (B99), Najdorf, 7...Be7 main line"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Najdorf, I play this for solidity however I feel that I should have played the dragon in the long run since I'm not as familiar with this opening.} 6. Bg5 {The old main line and a very good opening.} e6 7. f4 {Soon to come is Qf3.  I've got several choices here including the strange looking Qc7.  However I choose to remain solid and play Be7 also good is Nd7.} Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 {Making e5 less of a threat. e5 dxe5 fxe5 Qxe5+ Qe3.} 9. O-O-O Nbd7 {Gaining more control over e5 and this knight is very well placed for blacks defense.} 10. g4 b5 {e5 is meet by Bb7.} 11. Bxf6 {I have many options here.  I'm not sure that my move was that great...  Nxf6 Bxf6 and gxf6 all work.  I'm under the opinion that Nxf6 is best here.} gxf6 {opening the g-file for my rook.  However now my king is trapped in the center and white is going to be pushing pawns against me soon.} 12. f5 Ne5 {?! e5 was better making the center static and easier to play against.  However I couldn't help but play this move because of the space left behind.} 13. Qh3 {This is a really good move as it allows for future play Qh5+ since the e6 pawn will fall.} b4 {kicking back the knight.} 14. Nce2 Bb7 15. fxe6 Rc8 {I think better is Bxd4. fxe6 is bad because Nxe6 is going to be difficult to remove form that location.} 16. exf7+ Kxf7 17. Bg2 {Defending the e4 which is critical to whites position.} Qd7 {preventing g5 and preparing to play Qa4.} 18. Nf5 Qa4 {Probably would have been better off playing a waiting move Rc5.} 19. Qb3+ {White forces a trade of queen.  I felt in game that white should win the race but my queen is hard to deal with on this square so white eliminates the threat.  This is still a very good move because white is up a pawn and my king is very open.} Qxb3 20. axb3 Nxg4 {I had other plays here but I felt this to be the best continuation.  I'd rather be aggressive than passive, but this does allow white to enter my position.} 21. Nxd6+ Bxd6 22. Rxd6 Ne3 {I had planed on coming in with Rxc2! after Rd7+ but I made an error in my calculation which allowed white to take my rook on c8.} 23. Rd7+ Ke6 {? I was thinking I could come to e5 soon however white has other plans!} 24. Bh3+ Ke5 {now I'm in trouble.  White has the ability to win the exchange with Re7+!} 25. Re7+ Kd6 26. Bxc8 {Kxe7 Bxb7 and I'm down a piece. } Rxc8 {I play this move in order to be down just the exchange however white is signification better here.} 27. Rxb7 Rxc2+ 28. Kb1 Rxe2 29. Rxb4 {White is now up the equivalent of a piece and has better play.  Rook and knight don't work well together and the rooks have plenty of open files and ranks to play round with.} Ke5 30. h3 a5 {Kicking the defense of the e4 pawn soon.} 31. Ra4 Nc2 32. Rxa5+ Kxe4 {My only plan is to try to promote my f-pawn quickly.} 33. Rh5 {I loose the h-pawn which turns out to be my downfall.} f5 34. Rxh7 Nd4 {I move the knight because of the threats of Re7+} 35. Re7+ Kd3 36. Rxe2 Kxe2 {Now i loose the race with my next move.} 37. h4 f4 {This looses.  I may have been able to stay in the game. with Ne6 trying to black the pawn but I probably would have ended up loosing anyway.} 38. h5 Nf5 {I resign because of h6! and now I must sake my knight for the pawn and I can't stop white form queening one of the b pawns now.}
