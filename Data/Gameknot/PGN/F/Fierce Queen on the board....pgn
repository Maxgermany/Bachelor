1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 4. c3 a6 5. O-O Bc5 6. d4 exd4 7. cxd4 Bb6 8. d5 Nce7 9. e5 d6 {things are not going well for Black, in this Italian party: the center is already lost, and White is about to push forward with his rogue center pawns...} 10. e6 fxe6 11. dxe6 d5 12. Re1 {White is prepared to sacrifice Bc4: after dxc4, Qxd8+, Kxd8, there will be lots of possibilities for compensation; in the meantime, White is covering the all important e6...} dxc4 13. Qxd8+ Kxd8 14. Nc3 Nf6 15. Be3 {a slick trap, still covering for e6: after Bxe3, Rxe3, restores the balance; after Bxe6?, Bxb6, wins back the sacrificed piece...} Bxe6 16. Bxb6 cxb6 17. Rxe6 Nfd5 {Black is unnecessary volunteering to give the won piece back: but this is getting Black in even more trouble...} 18. Rd1 {of course...} Kd7 19. Rxb6 {positional luck, to say the least: but these are the breaks in blitz; White has restored the material balance in a won position...} Rad8 20. Ne5+ {maybe better straightaway Rxb7+: but I wanted to create a new pin over Ne7, and play Ng6; and once I reached it, I discarded it: too complex...} Ke8 21. Rxb7 Nxc3 22. Rxd8+ Kxd8 23. bxc3 {Rb8+, is followed by Nc8: better this...} Re8 24. g3 {time for preparing to clear the bottom line...} Kc8 25. Ra7 Kb8 26. Rxa6 Nd5 27. Nxc4 Nxc3 28. Kg2 Ne4 29. h4 {Black has no moves left: so he resigned...}
