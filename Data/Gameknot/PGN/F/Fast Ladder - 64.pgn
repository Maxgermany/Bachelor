[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {I like to play the queens pawn because it is less common and thus more likely to throw my opponent off  I played this game very badly, if your looking for a good learning game this isnt it, unless your me, which you aren't, so move along little doggy.} e6 2. e4 {This is the obvious continuation, givnig me great central control} d5 {everything seems fine} 3. e5 {This seems like a good move, cutting black back a bit early in the game  I also noticed upon annotation that this effectively crunches his king side while widening mine, obviously this had the opposite on my queenside, but shes not the most important peice on the board} c5 {I dont really know how to respon properly to this} 4. c4 {I supose at the time  this seemed like a good move, I think i would play nf3 probably would have been a better response, or even the simple c3} Nc6 {this is getting dangerous, 2 to 1 on d4 already} 5. Be3 {this seemed good at the time an still does, based on where I am wtih this game} Qb6 6. Bd3 {This is a terrible move effectivly destroying whatever hold I had on d4, I dont know what I was thinking, probably that I wanted to castle right quick. E2 would have been OK however the reality is that Nf3 would have been about 100 times better.} cxd4 {It becomes apparent how bad my neglection of nf3 was, not to mention bd4 which continues to cause me greif} 7. Bd2 {...I think this speaks for itself} Nxe5 {the lack of Nf3 continues to hound me} 8. b3 {Not bad, reinforces c4, recovers the b file from Qb6, which in my opinion black was a fool not to play on, not that he has a bad game at this point.  The problem with this move however is that it should have been made about 4 or 5 turns ago.  Qc2 would have been much better as it would have prevented Nxd3+  } Nxd3+ {Im not going to say anything more about the lack of Nf3  Now Im starting to get into some real trouble, loosing my ability to castle} 9. Kf1 dxc4 10. bxc4 Qc5 11. a4 Be7 {I dont know why he didnt play Qxc4, I would have} 12. Na3 {seems OK, Im trying to the tempo back, really I should be doing everything I can to beef up my kingside, but I think I was hopping for some sort of opening that would allow me to go on the offensive....not such a good decision} Nf6 13. Nh3 {This looks bad, but really I want to get my king a bit safer, develope my knite and be able to play qf3, so..yeah, that was the plan} Qf5 14. Nc2 {Qxa3 is no longer a threat, so I leap at the oprtunity to centralize my knite, starting to feel that Im in trouble} Bc5 15. Qf3 {seems good, trading queens would be great, I know that IM behind on material, but hes got enough heat bearing down on me as it is} Bd7 16. Qxf5 exf5 17. Nf4 {I think this is a devent move, it doesnt really threaten anything but it gives me some footing,  Im starting to notice the e file which is quite dangerous for my stuck king} Ne4 {this is the problem with f4 is that it really doesnt apply any presure and now black is doing a good job of choking me} 18. Nh3 {...sigh, I think I was trying to defend f2 from both his nights, I would play nxd3} Nxd2+ {this is a decent move by black  I would have played f4 instead followed by 0-0 and some rook e file action, but im not him, but nxd2+ is also good} 19. Ke2 Nxc4 20. Kxd3 {this is stupid, black never should have allowed this to happen I do like to play with my king and at my rank most players seem surprized by an attacking king, so there is that  Its funny that Im critizing blacks failure to use the file when my rook hasnt moved all game} Nb2+ 21. Kd2 d3 22. Rae1+ {finaly} Be6 23. Ng5 Bxf2 24. Ref1 Bb6 {seemed to work} 25. Rfe1 dxc2 26. Nxe6 {I dont know why I did that, at this point I should be saving whatever material I have left} fxe6 27. Kxc2 Nxa4 28. Rxe6+ Kf7 29. Rhe1 Rhc8+ 30. Kb3 Nc5+ {game over man  not my best game......oh well}
