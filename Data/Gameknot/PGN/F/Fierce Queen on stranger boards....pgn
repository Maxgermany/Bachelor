1. e3 d5 2. Ne2 Bf5 3. g3 e6 {White's approach is unusual, to say the least: Black is just expecting and preparing for d2-d4...} 4. Bg2 Bd6 5. O-O Nf6 6. d4 O-O 7. Nf4 c5 {after dxc5, Bxc5, grants an early advantage for Black...} 8. c3 {up until now, a very exotic breed of a Queens' Pawn opening: Blacks' next move will shake things up...} e5 9. dxe5 Bxe5 10. Nxd5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 Nd7 12. Bxb7 Rb8 13. Bc6 Nb6 14. Qxd8 Rfxd8 15. Nd2 {White is two pawns ahead, but cannot make any play...} Na4 {Black is saccing a full piece: there is a winning threat in Nxb2, as well as Nxc3...} 16. e4 Be6 17. f4 Bc7 {relocating the pieces...} 18. Bxa4 Rxd2 {White is trapped in a series of forced moves...} 19. Bxd2 Bc4 {probably better than Bh3...} 20. Rfd1 Rxb2 {and here, White timed out after a couple of minutes; in a pretty much won position with a full Rook ahead, but with many forcing drawing chances for Black: except for the clock, which was on Blacks' side...}
