[Opening "Nimzo-Indian defence (E20)"]

1. d4 {Black - their team captain, and distracted with a player turning up late - misplays the opening, drop the exchange (rook for bishop), sacs more material for an attack, but careful defence wins the day!} Nf6 {The Indian Defence} 2. c4 {Main line} e6 {I thought he was heading for a Nimzo-Indian} 3. Nc3 c5 {but he heads for a Benoni} 4. d5 {Which I go into.} d6 {A usual move in all Benoni systems.} 5. e4 {I grab the centre.} e5 {And he closes the position up and heads for a Czech Benoni. I don't like this move, as it loses a tempo, but as the position is closed, it doesn't matter too much. It has been played before.} 6. g3 {But this is unusual too. I hope to play f2-f4 and to be able to take back with a pawn, should he exchange on f4.} Be7 {Usual development.} 7. Bg2 {I develop my bishop too.} Nbd7 {This is not in my opening databases, although such a natural developing move can hardly be wrong. 0-0 has been played before, as has Bg4, although I think this just loses time to f2-f3.} 8. f4 {As according to plan.} Qa5 {This doesn't achieve anything, so 0-0 looks better to me.} 9. Bd2 {Simply breaking the pin.} O-O {Now he castles.} 10. f5 {I thought this was great for me, clamping down on the king side. I tend to think he should have exchanged on f4 first, and I was keen to prevent this exchange. Fritz prefers Nf3 though.} Qd8 {The queen scurries back.} 11. g4 {I continue with this King side advance. Fritz is still not impressed!} Ne8 {Preparing a check on h4.} 12. Nf3 {I develop! Fritz likes this move!} Bh4+ {He throws in the check.} 13. Ke2 {I leave it. Fritz prefers the exchange, and then putting the king on f1, but I didn't want to invite his queen into my position. Also this move threatens g4-g5, cutting off the bishop on h4.} h6 {This seems a logical way of meeting the threat, but Fritz prefers retreating the bishop.} 14. Qg1 {Again, not a move Fritz likes, but I like it - it aims the queen at the Kg8. I have a plan of exchanging on h4 followed by Bf3 and g4-g5.} a6 {Preparing the b7-b5 break. Right idea, but Fritz prefers Be7.} 15. Nxh4 {So I take.} Qxh4 {He takes back.} 16. Bf3 {I continue with my plan.} b5 {and he continues with his.} 17. g5 {And mine as well. Fritz likes this move. I think this position is getting hard for black.} hxg5 {He takes.} 18. Bxg5 {I take back, threatening the queen.} Qh7 {A natural retreat.} 19. Be7 {And, as you can see, this is where I win the exchange.} Nef6 {Now he gives me a choice - to win the exchange or a pawn?} 20. Bxf8 {I greedily grab the exchange - Fritz prefers taking the pawn.} Kxf8 {The best way to recapture, as the Nd7 wouldn't have its chances enhanced on f8 - it still wouldn't have many squares.} 21. Qg5 {One idea is that if he now moves Nf6, I have Qd8 mate! Fritz prefers the more natural exchange on b5 followed by a3.} Nb6 {He adds to the pressure on c4. Fritz likes this move.} 22. cxb5 {This seemed best to me, although Fritz prefers c2-c3.} axb5 {He takes back.} 23. Kd2 {I'm trying to reach safety on c2. Of course I can't take on b5 as 23. Nxb5? Ba6 24. a4 Nxa4! wins for black. Fritz prefers h4.} b4 {Continuing his attack. Fritz likes this too.} 24. Nb5 {This seemed to me to be attacking, but Fritz doesn't like it.} Nc4+ {He throws in a check - Fritz likes this move.} 25. Kc2 {I defend the b pawn, although Fritz prefers Kd2-e2.} Ba6 {This seems to be a mistake, it allows an unpleasant fork. Fritz prefers Bd7.} 26. Nc7 {This seemed a natural fork, although Fritz prefers a2-a4.} Qh3 {Qh3 was played after a long think. I must admit I hadn't seen this move, and I have to be very careful now.} 27. Raf1 {This seemed natural to me, although Fritz prefers Ra-e1.} Nxe4 {Fritz prefers Na3+ - a move my team mate Peter Lovatt was claiming probably draws. I think he may be right. I think this loses.} 28. Bxe4 {So I just take the knight.} Ne3+ {He throws in the check.} 29. Kb1 {I decide to run my king to safety. Fritz prefers just Qxe3.} Nxf1 {He takes my rook.} 30. Nxa8 {So I take his - Fritz doesn't like this move!} Bd3+ {He throws in a check.} 31. Ka1 {I simply ignore it. Fritz likes this move. Now white is threatening mate on d8, and white is a whole rook down. If f6 I was intending Qg2. Black resigned. I get the feeling neither of us really understood what was going on, given how rarely we picked what Fritz considers to be the best move!
