1. e4 {This guy busted me up pretty bad, I need to figgure out how...} d5 2. e5 {Aggressive...  Should I respond in like?  d4 shows some promise...} d4 3. Bc4 c5 4. h3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bf5 6. d3 {White has played well, but looks over extended.  I'm thinking Na4 to pressure White's Bishop.} Na5 7. Bd2 Nxc4 {This trade removes the threat to f7 and double White's c Pawn(s).  I've set up the next 6 conditional moves.  I doubt the game will work out that way.} 8. dxc4 Qb6 {White must protect b2} 9. b3 Qe6 10. O-O Be4 {Pressures the Knight protecting the Pawn.} 11. Re1 f5 {I'll reget this move.} 12. exf6 e.p. {Maybe not....} Qf5 {A diagonal battering ram, aimed at vulnerable c2} 13. Nh4 {White's best defence.  And I must retreat.  This is bad, I can't protect my Bishop..  Damn!    Here it is!  This is where I lost the game!} Qxf6 14. Rxe4 e5 15. Qg4 Nh6 16. Bxh6 gxh6 17. Nd2 Bd6 18. f4 Ke7 19. fxe5 Bxe5 20. Rae1 {End of line....}
