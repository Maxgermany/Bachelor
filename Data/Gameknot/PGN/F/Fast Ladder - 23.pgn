[Opening "Sicilian (B99), Najdorf, 7...Be7 main line"]

1. e4 {I decided to analyze one of my loses, especially, because my opponent found a beautiful way to end the game.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The opening is Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation. This opening has been played a lot at grandmaster level.} 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 {We are stilling following the well-known theory.} 9. O-O-O O-O {This is first time I deviate from the theory. 9. Nbd7 is the most played move here. 9. O-O is probably not that good, although I found out that even Bobby Fischer played this once (Unzicker-Fischer, Buenos Aires 1960), but lost that game.} 10. Qg3 Rd8 {And now we are definitely out of the book. As shown later in the game, the rook does not belong here. But I was worried that White plays Bh6 at some point and I wanted to be able to play Bf8 for defence, and possibly Ne8 if necessary. However, especially with opposite side castling, concrete lines are more important than vague ideas.} 11. Kb1 {I sensible move. The king is probably safer at b1.} b5 {This pawn push serves multiple objectives. It frees the b7-square for the bishop, and advances a pawn towards the enemy king. Later, b4 might force White to move the knight, which leaves e4 unprotected.} 12. Be2 {The bishop will go to f3, where it opposes the b7-bishop. White does not have to worry about 12. b4, because he can exchange on f6, eliminating the knight that attacks the e4-pawn.} Bb7 {Following my plan. I add pressure on e4 and develop the bishop.} 13. Bf3 {Defending the e4 pawn.} Ra7 {This might seem like a random move, but it has an idea behind it. I was calculating what happens after White plays 14. e5. Then White can play Bxb7 in many lines attacking the rook and basically forcing the recapture with the queen. I did not like the queen on b7. Now the rook can capture the bishop. But the other side of the coin is that the rooks are not easily connected, which leaves the d8-rook a little vulnerable, and the b5-square is an obvious square for a knight fork, if White can make it work tactically.} 14. Rhe1 {Now White is fully developed and ready to act.} b4 {Here comes the b4-push. I wanted to dislodge the knight from c3 where it protects the e4-square.} 15. e5 {But this was a nasty surprise. I had calculated 15. e5, but concluded that it is not good for White here.} dxe5 {I simply capture the pawn, not sensing the danger. 15...bxc3 16. exf6 did not appear good, because I could not take back on f6, because the queen on g3 allows White to take back with Bxf6.} 16. fxe5 {Recapture, as I expected.} bxc3 {I thought I could now take the knight.} 17. Bxf6 {Ok, White takes with the bishop and not with the pawn. After 17. exf6 I had planned 17...Qxg3 simplifying into an endgame, where Black has better pawn structure.} Bxf6 {This is a mistake, although at that point it seemed like a logical choice, because I still expected 18. exf6 Qxg3 19. hxg3 and a nice endgame.} 18. Nb5 {This is the blow that ends the game. I just stared at the board for a while, and slowly I began to see that I was completely lost. White did not take back the piece, but offers an other one. But 18...axb5 19. exf6 threatening both the queen and a checkmate on g7 wins, because 19...Qxg3 is followed by 20. Rxd8#. A counter-threat like 17...Qb6 is just not enough: 18. exf6 g6 19. Rxd8+ Qxd8 20. Nxa7 and White can probably even save the knight, because the knight on b8 is only protected by the queen. I did not like losing a rook, so I decided to give White a chance to go wrong.} Bxf3 {This is a desperate attempt, but I am losing anyway, so it was worth trying. Now 19. Nxc7 Rxd1+ 20. Rxd1 Bxd1 21. exf6 g6 and there are still practical chances.} 19. exf6 {But White plays the correct move.} g6 {Preventing the immediate checkmate.} 20. Qxc7 {And taking with the queen, not with knight, nails it. The only way to prevent checkmate is 20...Rxd1+ 21. Rxd1 and now all my pieces are hanging.}
