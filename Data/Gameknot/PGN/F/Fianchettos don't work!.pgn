1. g3 e5 2. Bg2 {The uncommon line on Benko's opening. The fianchetto is very hypermodern, although I don't particularly like it.} d5 {Black has central control.} 3. b3 {Fianchettos, in my opinion, are a waster of time and space on the board that is better used in real development.} Nc6 4. Bb2 Bf5 {White has his fianchettos, while black has central development.} 5. f4 {Pawn chain, attacking the center.} exf4 {Black will deal on White's terms and create a hanging pawn on the kingside.} 6. gxf4 Qh4+ {An extremely aggressive play, setting up for two successive checks and taking a White pawn.} 7. Kf1 Nf6 {But Black can wait, instead bolstering his center a bit.} 8. Nf3 {White responds, taking the check away and forcing the Black queen to do something.} Qxf4 {The queen has few other options, as she is suddenly cornered on the kingside and must get out somehow.} 9. e3 {White wants the queen out.} Qh6 {A strange and not overall good move, this puts the queen in a corner and could prove dangerous later.} 10. c4 {More forays into the center.} dxc4 11. bxc4 {Black has created a hanging White pawn but has little center presence. } O-O-O {Black will castle and help defend his king a bit.} 12. d4 {Now look who has the center under control.} Bh3 {Black is resorting to flank-attacking but has spotted a weakness in White's formation.} 13. d5 {White confidently continues down the board.} Na5 {Black, without many secure moves for the knight, chooses to attack White's queenside.} 14. Na3 {No more good attacks. The Black knight is stuck.} Bc5 {Black is mobilizing his pieces to attack the White formation, which is looking a bit soft.} 15. Rc1 {White trying to get more involved now.} Ne4 {Perhaps not preferable to 15... Bxe3.} 16. Nd2 {White wants the Black knight out of the middle.} Nxd2+ {And he will deliver a check along the way.} 17. Qxd2 Bxg2+ {Black needs another check.} 18. Kxg2 {Not what White wanted. The queen still threatens Black's knight on a5.} Qxe3 {If White takes the knight then the king's in serious trouble.} 19. Qxe3 Bxe3 {So we have a queen trade and a threat on the White rook on c1.} 20. Rce1 Rde8 21. Bxg7 {White tries to chase the bishop away and instead gets more threats on his position, so he will cherry-pick the pawn.} Rhg8 22. Kf3 {The bishop is getting annoying and must be removed.} Rxg7 23. Rxe3 Rxe3+ 24. Kxe3 {The White bishop, Black figures, could be dangerous later, so Black figures to start clearing the board.  That said, his knight is still trapped.} c6 {And this helps clear that up.} 25. h4 {White wants all his pawns as far up the board as possible.} cxd5 26. cxd5 {Now the knight is still trapped, but he can more easily escape.} Kd7 {The king must get involved.} 27. Ke4 {A duel coming.} f6 28. Kd4 {Black has managed to intimidate White's king onto the d-file, where White's pawn is a nice little piece to be maneuvered around.} Kd6 29. Nc4+ {This is just stupid. White has Black's knight trapped and useless, and he just throws away his own knight.} Nxc4 30. Kxc4 Rg4+ {Black has an advantage here, as White's pawn is as good as dead and Black's pawns are more maneuverable, not to mention more in number.} 31. Kd3 Kxd5 {White is seriously on the defensive.} 32. a4 {More due to a lack of ability to do anything else.} Rxa4 33. Ke3 Re4+ 34. Kf3 {White's king has been chased to the side of the board and his rook is stuck protecting the h-pawn.} b5 35. Kg3 Ke5 36. h5 {White is fishing for any hope.} h6 {Black has now neutralized White's pawn. No more dilly-dallying for Black.} 37. Kf3 b4 38. Rb1 {White has to defend against the pawn.} f5 {More attacks!} 39. Rf1 a5 40. Ra1 {Black has been content to quietly advance his pawns as White's rook runs all over the first rank. That cannot continue; it's action time.} Kf6 41. Rxa5 Kg5 42. Rb5 {White can take either pawn and will keep Black on his toes; White can still easily win this game.} Rf4+ 43. Ke3 Rh4 44. Kd3 Rxh5 {White is now clutching at straws. The pawn ought to be taken now just to get it off the board and allow White to regroup.} 45. Kc4 {But for some bizarre reason it isn't. The weak pin is too irresistible for Black.} Rh4+ 46. Kb3 Re4 {Now the bridge is built and Black can comfortably promote a pawn.} 47. Ka4 h5 {White now has nothing left and ought to resign here. But he doesn't.} 48. Rxb4 Rxb4+ 49. Kxb4 h4 {Black, to avoid complications, will just promote the h-pawn.} 50. Kc4 h3 51. Kd3 h2 52. Ke2 h1=Q {Now, how to checkmate?} 53. Ke3 f4+ 54. Kf2 {This isn't smart. If White is determined to play on, he ought to escape into the open board where Black may make some mistake.} Kg4 55. Ke2 f3+ {The pattern continues.} 56. Kf2 {This need to stay close to the action speeds up the checkmate.} Qg2+ 57. Ke1 Qe2# {Overall, I love bloodbaths. Lesson learned: don't offer trapped pieces a way out. That's where White's game really went to crap. Also, that fiancehttos don't work.}
