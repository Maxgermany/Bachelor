1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Guicco Piano} 4. c3 {Most common, preparing the d4 pawn push.} Nf6 {My favorite move here.} 5. d3 {Hm... The Guicco Pianissimo, the very quiet game. Never my favorite, I think it's a little passive.} d6 6. O-O O-O 7. Bb3 Qe7 {I was preparing be6 and I didn't want doubled pawns but I'm starting to thing maybe Re8 would have been better... Thoughts?} 8. Nbd2 Be6 9. h3 {Hmph not what I expected.} Qd7 {I was looking at saccing my bishop.} 10. Ng5 {! Good move, defends h3, and attacks my bishop.} h6 {?! Allows doubled pawns, but I planned to attack down the f file. In this game it paid off.} 11. Nxe6 fxe6 12. Nc4 Qf7 {Let's take stock of this position: Material: equal, but white has the bishop pair on an open board. White has a slight edge in material. Piece activity: I think white is better. Presence of threats: Black is much better, with a massive attack on f2. Pawn structure: Black has doubled pawns and two pawn islands, white has no doubled pawns and one pawn island. White is better. Overall, I think that if white can survive the coming attack then he'll end up on top.} 13. Be3 {! Good, this cuts down an attacker on f2, and he has the choice to take with his knight or his pawn.} Bxe3 14. Nxe3 {I might have taken with the pawn...While the doubled pawns might have been a slight disadvantage, it would allow the f rook to contest the f file.} Nh5 {Unleashing my queen and rook battery on f2.} 15. Ba4 {? Not good, he is under attack, he should try to bring his queen over to help defend.} Nf4 {A good spot for my knight even if it blocks my queen and rook. Although white is not actually being attacked heavily enough for him to worry, he should take some defensive measures.} 16. g3 {?? And this isn't one!! If he hadn't done this then I doubt I could have made it through. This, however opens the back door for me.} Nxh3+ {! Obvious and good.} 17. Kg2 Ng5 {Suddenly, there are multiple threats on the board. White's queen is doing a fine job of defending though.} 18. f3 {?? Allows my queen to go to h5 with disastrous results.} Qh5 {!} 19. f4 {Good, discovers an attack but it's just a bluff.} Qh3+ 20. Kf2 Qh2+ {! I am proud of this move, it forces his king into the corner where he is helpless.} 21. Ke1 Qxg3+ {Obvious follow up.} 22. Kd2 {I was vaguely hoping for Rf2?? Then Rxf4! would spell white's doom.} Rxf4 {I am now up by three pawns and have a powerful attack. But if white defends accurately he might be able to pull through. Of course, I would be up by three pawns and would probably win the endgame.} 23. Rxf4 Qxf4 24. Qe2 {With a pair of rooks traded down and his other rook ready to be activated you might think the worst is over wouldn't you?} Nf3+ {NOPE!} 25. Kc1 Rf8 {Again, the f file is the funnel to channel all my pieces down. White is staring down the barrel of a devastating attack poised for launch.} 26. Bd1 Rf6 27. Kc2 {I'm really disappointed that I missed Nd4+!! winning his queen but oh well.} Qh4 28. Kb1 Qg3 29. Qg2 Qe1 {Pins his bishop and puts him in another perilous position. This is my second attack, and if it doesn't manage to break through then I'll have to content myself to just exchanging and trying to win the endgame.} 30. a3 {Good move, provides a hole for his king.} Nd2+ 31. Kc2 {?? Losing blunder for him.} Rf2 {!! I finally find it. To prevent a lethal discovered attack white must swap queen for rook. White resigns. Ordinarily I don't care if my opponent resigns, but I kind of with I could have played this out to mate as it seems really interesting. Oh well it's his choice.}
