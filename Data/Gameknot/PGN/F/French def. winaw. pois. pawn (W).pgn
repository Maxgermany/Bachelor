1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 {This opening favorise both attacks with semi open files and diagonals.} Ne7 7. Qg4 {Menacing a king side attack} Qa5 8. Bd2 {Some defense is necessary before attacking seriously the black king.} O-O 9. a4 {Move not given in the database, but it seems efficient, obliging the queen to retreat.} c4 {Black prefers not to retreat his queen but this move suits me as well, blocking the queenside as I anyway planned to attack kingside and e file. } 10. Nf3 {preparing the short castle} b5 11. Be2 {I hesitated long but if black takes a4, I'll have one pawn late but the a black pawn will block the file as good as mine and anyway, I'll attack within two or three moves, so that it won't have time to be a queen. If I fail my attack, the game will be lost anyway but with queen, knight, two bishop and one rook on e file, my attack should succeed.} f6 {Not a good move, it weakens the king} 12. O-O bxa4 13. exf6 {Black must take with the rook and it will be vulnerable} Rxf6 14. Bg5 {Now the rook or the knight are doomed} Rg6 {Black prefer to loose the rook} 15. Ne5 Rxg5 16. Qxg5 {Menacing the knight that can be easily protected.} Nbc6 {Protecting the e knight and aiming at the center} 17. Rfe1 {White need the rooks on line 1 to defend against the queen but one rook can also support the attack. The e file will be the crucial place.} Qxc3 {Black underrates white's attack possibilities} 18. Qf4 {I thought that black would have plaid Nxe5 then Qxe5 menacing the e pawn and permiting Bg4 or Bh5} Nxd4 {Black chooses to carry on attacking. White has a mate in 3 moves.} 19. Qf7+ {one} Kh8 20. Qf8+ Ng8 21. Nf7# {}
