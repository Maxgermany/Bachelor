1. e4 e6 2. d4 c5 {I'm not used to this variation of the french defense, looks like a sicilian} 3. d5 exd5 4. exd5 d6 5. Nf3 {I don't like the sitution very much. The d pawn is too far away and this is a mistake, I should have try to defend it.} Bg4 6. Be2 Nf6 {Attacking the d pawn} 7. O-O {d pawn protected, I castle so that I can bring a rook on e1 to menace the black king and bring the rook on the open file} Be7 8. c4 O-O {Of course} 9. Nc3 {I don't think that white has a too bad game at this side. Material is equals, both kings are safe, no direct threat, Black controls a bit more the center, Both can bring a rook in one move on the e open file, white's pawn structure is a bit weaker because of the advanced d pawn, The general configuration is coherent on both side.} Nbd7 {good move aiming at the center and freeing the a Rook} 10. h3 {To repulse LSB but a weak move, I fear (sending the DSB on f4 would have been better, it would have menace the center)} Bxf3 11. Bxf3 {The e5 square is now free for the black} Ne5 {Black settle a knight on the center menacing c4 and white will have a hard time to remove it} 12. b3 Ne8 {Good move permitting the DSB to leave the nest protected by the queen} 13. Re1 {Occupy the open file} Rb8 14. Bf4 {Trying to clean off the center} Ng6 {It still seems ok for white : controlling the center better than black, owning the open e file, both kings secured, equal material, no direct threats, two unprotected pieces for white} 15. Qd2 {The losing move, planned to protect the knight and the DSB but I should have retreated the bishop in e3 or g2} Bf6 16. Rac1 {The queen alone cannot protects the two pieces} Nxf4 {Black goes for a trade} 17. Qxf4 {trade} Bg5 {Alas I oversaw it.  Anyway, it was too late. The wrong move was the 15th one} 18. Qf5 Bxc1 19. Rxc1 {So, the situation is now bad for white : black is better as far as material is concerned, blacks c and d pawns are on black squares and white has no more DSB.} Qf6 20. Qd3 {Beeing late in material, I have to refuse the exchange} g6 21. Re1 {Controlling the open file and hoping to slow the invasion the time for black to do a mistake} Ng7 22. Ne4 {Trying a counter attack} Qe7 23. Qc3 {Menacing 24 Nf6 but it would have been better to play firts Kf1 and then Nc5 } Qc7 24. Bg4 {Bad mistake} f5 25. Nf6+ {Only move to escape} Kh8 26. Bh5 {Nice move but unefficient. It's often better to play simply} Qf7 27. Nxh7 {As the knight is lost, better to take something as a compensation} Kxh7 {Then, it's only white trying desperatly to slow black's progression} 28. Bd1 Qf6 29. Qg3 Rfe8 30. f4 Qd4+ 31. Kh2 Rxe1 32. Qxe1 Qxf4+ 33. Kh1 Re8 {}
