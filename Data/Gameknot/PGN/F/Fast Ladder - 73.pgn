1. e4 {Lots of moves to come!} c5 2. c3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nf3 Nc6 {A popular variation of the Alapin Sicilian; 4. d4 is another very popular line.} 5. Bc4 {5. d4 is again, popular as well.} Nb6 6. Bb3 d5 {The other main option for black is 6.. c4, expecting 7. Bc2 Qc7 8. Qc2 g5, with aggressive play in the center.} 7. exd6 e.p. Qxd6 {this prevents d4.} 8. O-O c4 9. Bc2 Bg4 10. h3 Bh5 11. Qe2 {aiming to attack the weak c4 pawn, which happens to be cramping white's position.} Bg6 12. Bxg6 hxg6 13. Na3 Qd3 14. Re1 {If 14 Qxd3? cxd3 and black will enjoy comfortable developement while white tries to free himself from the burden of the d3 pawn.} e6 15. b3 Bxa3 16. Bxa3 Qxe2 {Allowing white to activate his queen with Qe4 would be a mistake.} 17. Rxe2 Rh5 {Rooks on open files, ranks too!} 18. Re4 Rd8 19. bxc4 Ra5 20. Bb4 Ra4 21. d4 {White can't avoid losing a pawn back.} Nxb4 22. cxb4 Rxb4 23. Rc1 Rc8 24. c5 Nd5 25. Kf1 {White looks to bring his king into the game.} Ke7 {...as do I} 26. Re2 f6 {taking away squares from the white knight.} 27. Rec2 b5 28. g3 {and not 28. cxb6? Rxc2 29. Rxc2 Rb1+ 30. Ne1} g5 29. Kg2 Rc6 {I begin the slow, painful process of manuevering my rooks into attacking position.} 30. Rd2 Ra6 31. Rcc2 Raa4 32. Rc1 Kd7 33. Re2 Rbc4 34. Rce1 Ra6 35. Rb2 b4 36. Re5 {Cute; obviously fxe5 Nxe5+ with Nxc4 with not be good for me.} Rc3 37. Ree2 Rca3 38. Ne1 Ra6a4 39. Red2 a6 {In chess, there is an idea of cat an mouse. Let me ramble briefly.  This is especially true for over the board chess, but when playing somebody, if you have the opportunity and play cat and mouse with your opponent, you should! The idea is this: Why do in one move what I can do in 2 (or 5, 10, 20) with the same results?   White cannot improve his position at the moment, so I play a6 instead of a5 to draw the game longer. To "torture" the opponent who is trying to hold his position, by making him think yet another turn. Hopefully with enough strain, he will make a mistake!   So, in conclusion, if you can improve (or hold) your position passively while your opponent mercilessly struggles with his, you should!} 40. Nd3 Kc6 {Improving my king position all that little. I'm preparing for an e5 break.} 41. Nc1 Nc3 42. Rd3 Kd5 43. Rc2 a5 44. Kf1 Nb5 45. Rdd2 Rc3 {And not ...Nxd4?? 46. c6!} 46. Ne2 {The side with the better position always wants to rid the board of heavy pieces in endgames. Off goes a pair of rooks.} Rxc2 47. Rxc2 Ra3 48. Ke1 Kc6 49. Kd2 e5 50. dxe5 fxe5 {White has no hope of holding the c pawn; he can only regroup and hope for a draw!} 51. Nc1 Nd4 52. Rb2 Kxc5 53. Nd3+ Kd6 54. Ne1 e4 55. Ng2 Kc5 56. Ne3 {My A and B pawns will be coming fast!} a4 57. h4 {Ke1 was a better try here.} Rd3+ 58. Ke1 a3 59. Rb1 Nf3+ 60. Ke2 {60. Kf1 Nd2+.} Rd2+ 61. Kf1 Rxa2 {It's all over, white must deal with the threats of my two connected passed pawns, and Nd2+ with a fork. White resigns.}
