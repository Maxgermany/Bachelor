1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 g6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 {The grandprix attack. } Bg7 5. Bb5 Nd4 6. O-O Nxb5 7. Nxb5 a6 {Here my opponent breaks away from theory.  Usually one waits to push the pawn, reserving the option of moving it to a5 in one move.  The rook usually moves to the b-file to push the b-pawn after that.} 8. Nc3 d6 9. d3 Nf6 {I wouldn't put my knight here.  I would move pawn to e6 and then knight to e7.  The knight on f6 becomes a target later on.} 10. Qe1 {Getting ready to move to h4.} O-O 11. Qh4 Bd7 {Looks too passive to me.} 12. e5 {The knight is revealed to be a target.} dxe5 13. fxe5 Ne8 {Forced, as Ng4 runs into h3 after I defend the e-pawn.} 14. Bh6 {Breaking into his fortress.} e6 {Aiming for a queen trade.} 15. Ng5 {A proactive attempt to keep the attack going.} f6 {This is the critical moment.} 16. Bxg7 {I thought long and hard before this move.  It proves completely justified.} fxg5 17. Rxf8+ Kxg7 18. Qf2 {The essential move in the combination.} Qe7 19. Rf1 Kh6 20. Rf7 {Weaving the mating net.} Qd8 21. Qg3 {Threatening mate.} g4 {Probably hoping for Qh4, but no such luck.} 22. Qxg4 Ng7 23. Qh3+ Nh5 24. g4 Be8 25. Rf7f8 Qg5 26. Ne4 {Forcing him away from his little pin.} Qe7 27. gxh5 gxh5 28. Rf1f6+ Bg6 {His last desperate hope was that I'd miss Rxa8 and allow his rook to take mine.} 29. Rxa8 {He resigned.}
