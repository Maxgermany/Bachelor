1. e4 {this game has some personal notes here and there; white is a player I battled on 3+10 blitz... I unexpectedly won a couple of games, so he trashed me back, which spurred him to challenge me to an unrated fight outside of blitz; so I complied, being rogue 1200 and all... for good measure: this full blood Sicilian fight is classified as ECO A40, unusual replies to 1. d4... Thanks a lot to Bert from Bay of Plenty, NZ... ;)} c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 {totally new for me, at the time; so I played what I knew...} Bg7 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nf6 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Be2 Na6 8. O-O d6 9. Be3 Nc5 10. f3 a5 11. Qd2 Bd7 12. Rfd1 a4 13. Ndb5 Ne6 14. b3 {up until now, the odds were fairly in whites' favor, especially after f4... this wipes out all the advantage...} Bxb5 15. cxb5 axb3 16. axb3 Rxa1 17. Rxa1 d5 {again in this somewhat Sicilian game, d5 disrupts whites' plans... the position is fairly equal...} 18. e5 Ng4 {nothing less, than an inspired Knight sacrifice, desperado style; white has no choice than to take it...} 19. fxg4 d4 20. Bxd4 Nxd4 21. Rd1 Bxe5 22. Bc4 Qc7 23. h3 {white is oblivious, of the trap black has weaved...} Nxb3 24. Bxb3 Bxc3 25. Qd5 Ba5 26. Qd7 {too agressive... needed was Kh1, e6, Qe4, Qc3, Qf3, Qb4, Rf1...} Qf4 27. Qxe7 {greed before the fall... best was Qd3, Bb6+, Kh1, Rd8, Qf3, Rxd1+, and pray... Qxb7 is met with Qe3+, Kh1, Qxb3...} Bb6+ 28. Kh1 Bc7 29. Kg1 Qh2+ 30. Kf1 Bb6 31. Qe4 {Bd5 may be slightly tougher...} Qg1+ 32. Ke2 Qf2+ 33. Kd3 Qb2 {black has managed, to bring the white King out in the open...} 34. Bd5 Rc8 35. Bxf7+ Kg7 {black does not take the bait... the bishop has to retreat, to prevent Qc2 mate...} 36. Bc4 Rd8+ 37. Bd5 Qxb5+ 38. Kc3 {all whites' moves are forced... Kc2 leads to Rc8+, Bc6, Rxc6+, Qxc6, Qxc6+... Kd2 to Rxd5+...} Ba5+ 39. Kd4 Qa4+ 40. Ke3 Bb6+ 41. Ke2 {Rd4, Re8, Be6, Qxd4+, Qxd4+, Bxd4+, Kxd4, Rxe6... we all die, and black is a rook ahead; case closed...} Re8 {poetic justice... white loses the queen and resigns...}
