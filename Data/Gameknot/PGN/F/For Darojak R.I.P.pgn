1. e4 {1.e4. I alternate this and 1.d4. I don't have a preference.} e6 {French Defense. } 2. d4 {Taking the other central square.} Nf6 {the main line here is 2...d5 where white has the option of either 3.Nc3,3.Nd2,3.e5,or 3.exd5} 3. Nc3 {defending the pawn and developing the piece} Na6 {?! an odd move. "Knights on the rim are dim" } 4. Nf3 h6 {again,another odd move. Black prevents Bg5 but I was not planning to develop my bishop there.} 5. Bxa6 {I take the Bad Knight which,in retrospect is a bad move.} bxa6 {however the double isolated a-pawns will be a permanent weakness for me to targer} 6. O-O {I was really feeling good about my position} Bb7 {fianchettoing the Bishop and attacking the pawn} 7. Bf4 {? develops but loses the pawn!} Bxe4 {This was the turning point for my attitude of the game. I was not going to lay down and die. I was going to win the game at all cost. Whatever it takes. For my friend.} 8. Nd2 {not recapturing the piece. I'm going to need them} Bb7 9. Re1 {White is better developed at this point and I was looking for an attack.} Bd6 {offering a trDE} 10. Bxd6 {I take it,I want to double the pawns up. I at least want to win this pawn back.} cxd6 11. Nc4 {attacking the pawn,pretty obvious} Qc7 {I was hoping he would be generous,but nay he wants to be stubborn!} 12. Qe2 {bringing the queen into the fray and defending the knight} h5 {perhaps to lauch an attack on the kingside?} 13. Rad1 {I am centralizing all of my pieces because I want to open the center,thus opening lines to the king!} Qc6 14. f3 d5 {a minor mistake IMO. The Knight will play an important role on e5} 15. Ne5 {also attacking the Queen.} Qc7 16. f4 {I want to play 17.f5. I do not have to worry about the a8-h1 diagonal being open now} Ne4 17. Nxe4 dxe4 18. Qc4 {! A psychologically good move! "When you are ahead in material trade pieces" So can you imagine his joy when I offered a trade of Queens?} Qxc4 {?! Whoops! This gives me the pawn back!} 19. Nxc4 {threatening 20.Nd6+ forking King and Bishop} O-O 20. Nd6 {Doesn't matter I play it anyway! } Bd5 21. c4 {An in between move that is not really necessary but gains time} Bc6 22. Nxe4 Bxe4 23. Rxe4 {Yes! I got the pawn back! White has the better position again } d6 24. d5 exd5 { it is best to move 24...Rfe8} 25. Rxd5 {Now the other } Rab8 26. b3 {I don't want to trade pawns,which brings it closer to a draw. I want a win!} Rfd8 27. Re7 g6 {27...Ra8 defends the pawn but after 28.Rc7 followed by 29.Rc6,a pawn will fall} 28. Rxa7 Rb6 29. Ra5 {White now wins the other weak pawn that he created on the 5th move!} Re8 30. Kf2 {no need to hurry. This gets the King involved and covers the 2nd rank} Re4 31. g3 {now that everything is defended. I will win the pawn} h4 32. Ra7xa6 Rxa6 33. Rxa6 hxg3+ 34. hxg3 {This is a winning Rook endgame. White just needs to convert} Rd4 35. Ke3 Rd1 36. a4 {Passed pawns must be pushed!} Rc1 37. a5 {White can win the pawn immediately but just keeps pushing the pawn.} Rc3+ 38. Kf2 Rxb3 39. Rxd6 {now White choses to get the pawn back} Kf8 40. Rb6 {offering a trade of rooks that would be very favorable to White} Rc3 41. a6 {I don't care about the pawn} Ke7 {41...Rxc4 42. a7 Ra4 43.Rb8+ wins} 42. Rb7+ Kd6 43. a7 {one step away from queening} Ra3 44. Rxf7 Kc6 45. Rf6+ {lets just win the other pawn} Kb7 46. Rxg6 Kxa7 47. f5 {Now Black is doomed} Rc3 48. f6 Rxc4 {Black wins a pawn,but is already lost} 49. f7 Rc8 50. Rg8 {the rest is without commentary. I just convert it} Rxg8 51. fxg8=Q Kb6 52. Qd5 Kc7 53. Qe6 Kd8 54. Qf7 Kc8 55. Qe7 Kb8 56. Qd7 Ka8 57. g4 Kb8 58. g5 Ka8 59. g6 Kb8 60. g7 Ka8 61. g8=Q# {An emotional victory for me. Thanks in advance for any comments}
