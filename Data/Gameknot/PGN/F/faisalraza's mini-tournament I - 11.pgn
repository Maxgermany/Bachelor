1. d4 {My opponent timed-out with the game still in the opening phase... not much to comment about!} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 {QGD Slav defence, Alekhine variation (D10)} dxc4 5. a4 {preventing b5} Bf5 6. Nh4 e6 {?! I get to exchange my knight for the f5 bishop} 7. Nxf5 exf5 8. e3 Bd6 {preparing for Qc7 aimed at h2, black is planing to ram my king side with pieces and probably pawns as his pawn structure doesn't foresee anything good in the endgame} 9. Bxc4 {all theory until now black should castle after this move Qe7 is also possible, but as I consider Qc7 as the best plan for black, playing Qe7 here is just a lost tempo... interesting is Na6 with just one game played, a win for black ! in Gomez, Luis - Cau, Benjamin; Lyon (France); 2008} O-O 10. Qc2 {now I expect g6 Qc7 is also possible...}
