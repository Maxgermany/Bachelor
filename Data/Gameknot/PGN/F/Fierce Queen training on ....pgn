1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 Bg7 4. Nc3 {introducing the closed Sicilian: this forces the exchange on d4...} cxd4 5. Nxd4 d6 {to all my students: in the closed Sicilian, after Nc3, always d6 at some point...} 6. Be3 Nf6 7. f3 {preparing castling to the long side...} O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O Qa5 10. g4 Nxd4 11. Bxd4 Be6 12. Kb1 Rfc8 13. g5 Ne8 14. Bxg7 {to be totally honest: White has done well so far; at this point however, White might have considered Nd5...} Nxg7 15. f4 {also here, Nd5 was still an option...} Rxc3 {but not after this: Black is forcing the trading of Queens, in a better position for the soon upcoming endgame...} 16. Qxc3 Qxa2+ 17. Kc1 Nh5 {stronger than Qa1+, Kd2, Qa4: Black needs to make up for the lost Rook quality; of course, after f5, just gxf5...} 18. Qa3 {White cannot afford the luxury, of letting the Queens survive: from here, we go from the opening straight into the endgame...} Qxa3 19. bxa3 Nxf4 {equalizing material: Black is a tiny bit better; due to Whites' shattered pawn structure, and a severe lack in development...} 20. h4 {incautious euphoria, to say the least: maybe better Rd2; Blacks' pieces are about to deploy...} Bg4 21. Rd2 {the first real slip up, and a very bad one at that: as always, a fierce blunder is needed to lose a game; of course, Rd4 was much needed, followed by Rb4...} Bf3 {this forces the loss, of another very important pawn...} 22. Rhh2 Bxe4 23. Rd4 {too aggressive, at this very point: maybe better Rhf2, Ne6, Bd3...} d5 24. c4 {again, way too aggressive, and this time decisively losing: better Rb4, b6, c4; although he would get the same reaction, the Rook would have been safer...} Rc8 25. Kb2 {there was more hope, in Kd2, Ne6, Rxd5, Bxd5, cxd5, Rd8, Bc4: now, Rd4 is contested in a brutal way...} e5 26. Rd1 {better still, was Rxd5, Bxd5, cxd5, e4...} dxc4 {White loses another pawn; by now, Black has at least two passed pawns...} 27. Kc3 Bd3 28. Bxd3 {Bg2, e4, looks a bit safer: this will connect Blacks' passed center pawns...} cxd3+ 29. Kb2 e4 {I looked at f5, gxf6, Kf7, but this looked more promising...} 30. Rf2 Nd5 31. Rdf1 {setting up a desperate attack, but it is too late; the unleashed pawns will decide this...} e3 32. Rf2xf7 d2 33. Rd7 e2 34. Rff7 e1=Q 35. Rfg7+ Kf8 36. Rgxh7 {White is threatening mate on h8: so close, but yet so far...} Qc1+ 37. Kb3 Qc2# {}
