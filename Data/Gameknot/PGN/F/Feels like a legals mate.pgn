1. e4 {This checkmate felt to me like a legals mate. It was only a bit like it, but it still used bishops and knights.} d6 {This man always responds like this. I say it only wins him the opening about 10% of the time, but I am more experienced in the openings. } 2. Nf3 {This move stabilizes the center, and gets ready for D4. } Nf6 3. Nc3 {This protects the E pawn.} g6 {Planning to get his bishop out. Perfect time to get into action.} 4. Bc4 {I always do that move, followed by Ng5, to atack at F7. That is the part less like a legals mate.} Bh6 {This is the part were I invade. I am lucky that he does not see the future attack. :)} 5. d4 {D4 is my attack. I have a harder to find attack on h6, and his bishop.} O-O {Now I have a free bishop, and am close to his king, the invasion part.} 6. Bxh6 Re8 {That was his only option of he didn't want to lose another 2 points.} 7. Ng5 {The f7 attack I planned earlier is now in action. No longer avoidable by D5, but by e6} Bg4 {Here i shall show you the risk of legals.} 8. Nxf7 {if I were to lift my knight up now, it would be checkmate. Another 5 moves and it is. A free queen doesn't matter.} Qd7 {obviously} 9. Ne5+ {But that did not quite do it for black. A discovered kill makes it easier to win.} Kh8 {His only spot.} 10. Nxd7 Bxd1 {Now that we trade out queens, all I need is a protection on g7 to win} 11. Nxf6 {I have a mate in 2, avoidable, but not very. Luckily, He gives me a free checkmate by playing the game waster, Bxc2 } Bxc2 12. Nxe8 {Now I have a forced checkmate next move, no matter what he does. This isn't exactly what I call a "legals mate," but it IS what I call a 'feels like a legals mate.'} Nc6 {This move has variations, (Nd7, Ba4, g5,) but they all lead up to the killing checkmate....} 13. Bg7# {...Bg7# This is not a common checkmate that you come by. Many of you may disagree. "this is nothing like a legals mate." That is because it isn't. only 1 piece is even ON the 4th rank, it just feels to me like there are so many ways to checkmate in positions, and legals seems a way you can call it. Give me other ways to call it in the comments please, if you don't agree. See ya for now.           Posthuma}
