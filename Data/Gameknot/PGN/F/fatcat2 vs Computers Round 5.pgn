1. e4 {Guess who's back for Round 5!? It's the battered, ancient little handheld chess program Star Chess, which has bleeping red lights in every place imaginable! Time for Star Chess' revenge!} e6 {The French Defence.} 2. d4 d5 {Main line French.} 3. e5 {Star Chess initiates the Advance Variation, sometimes considered premature but perfectly playable and theoretically OK.} c5 {The usual move to undermine White's pawn centre.} 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Nh6 {An IM told me recently that this knight's place is on h6, which has always felt slightly unnatural to me. Time to test his advice.} 6. Bg5 Qb6 7. dxc5 {?! Unexpected, voluntarily weakening his pawn centre.} Bxc5 8. Qc2 Qc7 9. b4 Bb6 10. Bb5 Bd7 11. Bxh6 gxh6 12. Bxc6 bxc6 13. O-O O-O-O {Castling on opposite sides - this should get exciting. Black couldn't exactly castle on the kingside...though I grant you my queenside wasn't that good either.} 14. Nbd2 h5 {They're doubled, so I might as well use them to crack open White's kingside.} 15. c4 c5 16. b5 d4 {The queenside is closed off.} 17. Ne4 Kb8 18. Rab1 Rhg8 19. Nf6 {Sneaky! Star Chess still has some life in his silicon chips! He's picked up two pawns!} Rg7 20. Nxh5 Rg4 21. Qxh7 Rdg8 22. Nf4 Rg8g7 {For the first time, Star Chess paused to think. If he were human, I suppose he'd be frowning. The best Star Chess could manage was flashing an array of red lights in obvious discomfort.} 23. Qe4 Bc8 {Manoeuvring the bishop round to b7 to attack the queen.} 24. h3 Bb7 {Operation complete.} 25. Qxb7+ {With a whirr of discomfort, White played a move that shocked me. Sacrificing queen for bishop and rook! Why!?} Qxb7 26. hxg4 Rxg4 27. Nxd4 {?!?!?!?!?!? Even more unexpected. Can anyone shed light on this?} cxd4 28. g3 Qf3 {Grr, my major pieces are menacing your kingside, how do you feel about THAT, Star Chess?} 29. Rb3 Qe4 30. Nd3 {I don't know how I would have dealt with 30.f3...thankfully I didn't have to.} Rg8 31. c5 Rh8 32. f3 {Drat! Foiled again! This computer is determined to fight on!} Qe3+ 33. Kg2 Qe2+ 34. Rf2 Qd1 35. Rf1 Qc2+ 36. Rf2 Qd1 37. Rf1 Qe2+ {How many checkmating threats did I need to create before the game was...drawn. Star Chess performed a little self-satisfied beep. In my hurry to create checkmating threats I had managed to get my queen trapped in a web of my opponent's rooks, knight and pawns. The score is 3 to fatcat2, 2 to the Computers - this isn't over yet, my silicon friends...}
