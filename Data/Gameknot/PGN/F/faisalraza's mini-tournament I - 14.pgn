[Opening "Bogo-Indian defence, Gruenfeld variation (E11)"]

1. d4 {Black played aggressively in the opening, but all his threats were well handled and soon I build up some nice positional advantage, that allowed me to win with an attack on blacks poorly defended castled king} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+ 4. Nbd2 {Bogo-Indian defence, Gruenfeld variation (E11)} b6 5. a3 {forces black to decide} Bxd2+ 6. Bxd2 {and white achieved the objective of the Bogo-Indian with Nbd2 that is to have black's bishop exchanged by the knight} Bb7 7. e3 {preventing Bxf3} Ne4 {!} 8. Be2 {now black can exchange back the knight by the bishop d2, but with Be2 again Bxf3 is not viable...} f5 {?! N, both 0-0 (1/1/1) and d6 one game lost by black, were already tried here, I personally don't see the point of f5, it may gain some space, but overextends the king's wing pawns, and even after 0-0 0-0 d6 black would transpose to a line were the already played games were lost or drawn by black} 9. O-O Nc6 10. Be1 {for now, Be1 avoids Nxd2 while defends the f pawn, but at any moment in the future it may come to life when I play f3 or if I play the bishop to c3 aimed at g7 after a d5 pawn break} O-O 11. Nd2 {to get rid of that annoying knight on e4} Nd6 12. c5 {and now a pawn break not the previously intended one (d5), but a c5 pawn break and black has nothing better than the sequence bxc5 dxc5} bxc5 13. dxc5 Ne4 14. Nxe4 fxe4 15. Bc3 {and now the bishop is aimed at g6} a5 16. f3 {now another pawn break to open the f column, while getting rid of the e4 pawn} exf3 17. Rxf3 {inviting Rxf3 Bxf3 and white would have a slight advantage} d5 18. Bd3 {again inviting Rxf3 to play Qxf3 and Rf1} Rxf3 19. Qxf3 {threatens Rf1-Qf7+} Qe8 20. Rf1 Ba6 {? black exchanges the bishops, but the his rook will be off the game, and has to go back on his track, losing precious tempi} 21. Bxa6 Rxa6 22. Qg4 {now both g7 and e6 are threaten} g6 {?! Qg6 maybe better here, but then white still has Qf3 aimed at c7} 23. h4 {h4-h5 the third pawn break on this game, and now black has his pawn pinned} e5 24. h5 Ra8 {as previously stated black's rook has lost precious tempi with the light squares bishop exchange, and now has to hurry back} 25. Rf6 {and white opens several threats, against Nc6, g6, e5} d4 26. Bd2 {I expect dxe3 Bxe3, as black doesn't have any good moves to deal with all the threats} dxe3 27. Bxe3 {the e pawn has his path blocked and I defend d1 and c1-h6, so black doesn't have any counter-play against my king} Kg7 28. Re6 {keeping the rook in the 6th rank, while threatening black's queen } Qc8 {pinning my rook} 29. hxg6 {to remove the g pawn blocking my access to black's king} h5 30. Bh6+ {If black captures Kxh6? then g7 gives a discovered check and forces the captures of the Queen due to 30...Kxh6? 31.g7+ Kh7 32.g8=Q+ Qxg8 33.Qxh5+ Kg7 34.Qh6+ Kf7 35.Qf6++	} Kxh6 31. g7+ {zwinschenzug leaving the queen "en prise" that threatens Qg6 mate, the alternative is for black to exchange his queen by my rook, after which I'll get the knight also, and the game should end soon} Qxe6 32. Qxe6+ {and the knight falls next} Kxg7 33. Qxc6 Rc8 {?? all ended now} 34. Qd7+ {}
