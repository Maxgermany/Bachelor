1. c4 {Hi everyone!  I could not resist annotating this game which was a Team Match between the Master Mater and Master Bastalex.  As you can see, what will come is an awesome display - a successful mating attack against somebody near his own rating!  I hope we will all learn something from it.  Master Bastalex kicks off with 1. c4 which is the English Opening.  c4 hits out at the central square d5.} c5 2. Nf3 {2. Nf3 - fairly standard development in the English Opening although sometimes g3 is played here.} Nf6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - pawn trade.} e5 5. Nc2 {5. Nc2 - white's knight retreats to c2 after Freddy's pawn stab.} b5 {5....... b5 - a pawn sac. I wonder what Freddy is up to here?  Hmm, maybe to lure the c4 pawn away from controlling d5 so that Freddy can plonk his own pawn on it.} 6. cxb5 Bb7 {6. ..... Bb7 - it is becoming very clear, Freddy wants first grabs of the a8-h1 diagonal for his light square bishop.} 7. Nc3 {7. Nc3 - white now tries to get his pieces out.  The pawn on b5 is protected.} d5 8. e3 Bd6 9. b3 O-O {9. ....... 0-0 - after nabbing control of the centre, Freddy now tucks his king away safely on the wing.} 10. Bb2 Re8 11. Be2 Qe7 12. f3 {12. f3 - presumably to stop a black knight landing on e4 later on.  Another possibility is to prepare e4 for himself undermining Freddy's centre.} Nbd7 {12. ..... Nbd7 - Freddy now 1. Develops his b8 knight.  2.  Clears the decks between his two rooks.  3.  Reinforces the e4 square.} 13. O-O d4 14. exd4 exd4 {14. ...... exd4 - interesting, after white castles there is a pawn trade on the square d4.  this opens up some lines and Freddy sacrifices another pawn.......  } 15. Nxd4 Qe3+ {15. ...... Qe3+ - so that his queen can just Get Into the Groove!} 16. Kh1 {16. Kh1 - yup, those pawn trades/sac made a fine groove for Freddy's queen to just get on in there - that is something I must be on the lookout for when I next play him!  White has only two legal moves, Kh1 or Rf2.  As it is not desirable to put your pieces into a pin then Kh1 is the logical choice here.} Qh6 {16. ....... Qh6 - this move puts Master Bastalex in Old Matey's shadow, look to the square h2 brethren!} 17. f4 {17. f4 - blocks off the dark squared bishop's line to h2.  This block keeps white's kingside castled position as intact as possible.  Freddy, however, just whips that pawn right orf!} Bxf4 18. Rxf4 Qxf4 {18. ..... Qxf4 - now Freddy is exchange for a pawn up.} 19. Nc6 Ne5 {19. ...... Ne5 - the black pieces are flying towards white's king like vultures awaiting dinner!} 20. Nd5 Nxd5 21. Qxd5 {21. Qxd5 - white tries to relieve the pressure with a knight trade, but Freddy does not take no for an answer - where there's a will, there's a way as far as he is concerned.} Qe3 22. Bc4 {22. Bc4 - counter-attack though, will it work?  Freddy now trades off white's attacking knight for his bishop which is not doing anything much at the moment.} Bxc6 23. bxc6 Rad8 {23. ....... Rad8 - Freddy now brings his QR into play which attacks the WQ.} 24. Qb5 Ng4 {14. ..... Ng4 - hmm, could we have a Phildor's Legacy (smothered mate) in the offing here?} 25. h3 {25. h3 - white creates air for his king but Freddy lands a check in on f2 all the same.} Nf2+ 26. Kh2 Qf4+ {26. ..... Qf4+ - closing in.} 27. g3 Qd2 {27. ....... Qd2, threatening 28.....Ng4++ then if 29. Kg1 Qf2+ 30. Kh1 Qh2#.  If 29. Kh1 then Freddy's queen mates immediately on h2.  Nasty.} 28. Bxf7+ {28. Bxf7+ - this turns out to be little more than a spite check.  Freddy does not bother to recapture, instead he hides his king on h8.} Kh8 29. h4 {29. h4 - creating h3 as an escape square from the discovery but Freddy checks him on e4 instead.} Ne4+ 30. Kh3 Qf2 {30. ...... Qf2 - Freddy's opponent waves the white flag on the grounds of unavoidable mate.  He can only delay the mate by sacrificing material which Master Bastalex did not wish to do.  Awesome stuff - do you the jury agree?  Anyhow, well played Freddy!  Joanne}
