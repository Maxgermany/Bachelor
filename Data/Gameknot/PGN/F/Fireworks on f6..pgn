1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kan defense.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Qd3 {White is considering castling queenside.} e6 6. Nf3 Ngf6 7. Bg5 Bb4+ 8. c3 Be7 9. Nxf6+ {White wants to castle queenside but first captures on f6 to avoid 9 0-0-0 Nxe4 10 Bxe7 Nxf2 11 Bxd8 Nxd3+ 12 Rxd3 Kxd8} Bxf6 10. Bxf6 Nxf6 11. O-O-O O-O {The kings are on opposite sides of the board. This suggests a sharp game.} 12. h4 b6 13. Ne5 {To attack c6 and obstruct the e6 pawn. It also frees the f2 pawn to advance.} Bb7 {Black's placement of the light squared bishop is a problem. On b7 it temporarily has limited scope but the e6 pawn blocks it from getting to the d1-h5 or b1-h7 diagonal.} 14. f3 {Preparing g4 and limiting the black bishop's possible activity on this diagonal.} Qc7 15. g4 {White's kingside pawns are becoming dangerous.} Rad8 16. g5 {Harassing the knight.} Nd7 17. Ng4 {White wants to keep the knight alive. If white accepted a knight swap then the game would look drawish.  Also the black knight on d7 hinders the power of the d8 rook - so white doesn't want to remove this hindrance. The text does allow black to play ...Qf4+. (Black chooses not to.)} c5 {Opening the diagonal for the bishop and getting some advancing pawns in front of the white king.} 18. Qe3 cxd4 19. Rxd4 {White's position is steadily improving. Black's consolation is that lines have been opened for the b7 bishop.} e5 {Crunch time for white. Attack, or retreat the rook?} 20. Nf6+ {White offers a knight for free (but for positional advantage). Black has three choices; ...gxf6 (grabbing material), ...Kh8 (spurning the offer) or ...Nxf6.} gxf6 21. gxf6 Kh8 {Necessary. 21 ...Nxf6? 22 Qg5+ Kh8  23 Qxf6+ Kg8 24 Rg1#.} 22. Qh6 Rfg8 {Also necessary.} 23. Bd3 {Now white shifts the focus from g7 to h7 as the mating square.} Nf8 {Maybe better for black was ...f4.  } 24. Rg4 {White still has mating threats. And the black f7 pawn continues to isolate the black king from the other black pieces.} Rg6 25. Bxg6 fxg6 {Finally black has unstopped the blockage at f7. Now the black queen guards g7.} 26. h5 {There are two points to this move - to activate the h1 rook (by getting the white pawn off the h file) and to capture on g6 (to make the g4 rook more powerful).} Bxf3 {Forking the rooks.} 27. hxg6 Bxg4 {If black had captured the other rook ...Bxh1, then 28 g7+ Kg8  29 gxf8/Q#.} 28. f7 {And black resigns. The threat of 29 g7# is too strong. Of course black can play a desperate move like ...Rd1+ or ...Qxc3+ but this doesn't delay the checkmate for long. Eg. ...Rd1+ 29 Rxd1 Nxg6 30 f8/Q+ Nxf8 31 Qxf8# Also note that ...Ne6 doesn't work either because it leaves h7 unguarded.}
