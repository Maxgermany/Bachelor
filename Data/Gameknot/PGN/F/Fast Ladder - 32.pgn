1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 a6 {Seems to be a pretty uncommon opening, but according to the gameknot-analyzer, it's still a book opening.} 6. g3 {last book-move, it seems.} Bg4 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. O-O O-O-O {gameknot-analyzer means: -0.27, so a minimal advantage for black at this point} 9. d5 Qc5 {uncommon move, it seems, this position has only been reached 4 times in gameknot database.} 10. Be3 {attacking the queen...} Qa5 {now, here is the central point of this game and the last move that exists in the database... 3 games have reached this position so far, and 3 different moves have been played:  Qc1 (0-1), Qd3 (1-0), a3 (1-0)...  Somehow, I didn't like any of this move... and since I think that chess must be a fun game, I was trying the following experiment:} 11. dxc6 {?!... according to the analyzer, this is an inaccuracy that changes the rating to -0.99 (best would have been Qe1: -0.45)...  From here on, everything until move 16 went exactely the way as I planned it (with help of the board analyzer). I sacrificed my queen to have a dangerous attack on his king.} Rxd1 {... of course} 12. cxb7+ {of course... if the king takes the pawn, my lsb faces him if I move my knight on f3 away... if Kb8, the pawn could become really dangerous (but it still could be taken later)... -0.98} Kxb7 {expected} 13. Raxd1 {-0.72} Kc8 {?! -0.33... analyzer suggests c6 with -0.93. (I didn't see this move either though ;-) )} 14. Ng5 {!?... -0.02, this quality sacrifice was also planned...} Bxd1 15. Rxd1 {+0.98... I don't know why the analyzer suddenly saw such an advantage for me, the rating jumped from +0.13 to +0.98 just by doing this move... strange.} e6 {?! +2.25, analyzer suggests g6 with +1.27...} 16. Nxf7 {until here, everything went exactely as I wanted... black can't save his rook, since after 16. ...Rg8 17. Rd8#} Bc5 {! seems to be the best move for black... I felt very comfortable with my position here... so I played the next move too fast, in my opinion...} 17. Nxh8 {?!... Analyzer doesn't critisize this move, but after some more thinking, I guess Bxc5 might have been the better choice... that way, blacks queen can become quite dangerous... furthermore, I would have kept my bishop pair and I didn't see any threath for my knight, so I think this move was not good.  } Bxe3 18. fxe3 {+1.13... not that much advantage anymore.} Qc5 {? +2.66 ... this move seems logical at first sight (and was exactely what I expected). Qh5 would have been much stronger though, as black could have won my knight: (â€¦ Qh5 19. Bf1 Qe8 20. Bxa6+ Kb8 21. h3 Qxh8 22. Bc4 Qc8 23. Kh2 Qb7 24. Bxe6 Qb6 25. Rd8+ Kb7 26. Bb3 Qxe3... +1.13 according to the analyzer)    } 19. Nf7 {here I had to decide... saving the knight (and threathening a mate) and give away e3 or to protect the pawn and lose the knight (by creating a double pawn for black). Like I said, chess should be fun, so I tried the more risky way... ;-)} Qxe3+ 20. Kf1 {?! Even more risky... I just wanted to avoid his queen coming to f2, black has no immediate checks now. Still I think, this move was probably a little bit too risky.  black can't play Ng4 now, since I still have an active mate-thread (Rd8#)} Kb8 {?!... I was expecting c5 or Nd7, Analyzer suggests c6 ;-). Now I have a number of checks} 21. Rd8+ Ka7 22. Ra8+ Kb6 23. Rb8+ {setting a trap...} Kc5 {?? the final blunder... to be honest, I didn't see the forced mate in 6 moves, but I knew he would at least lose his queen.  Then again, I was a little disappointed... I really wanted to keep this game going on, with something like: 21. Rd8+ Ka7 22. Ra8+ Kb6 23. Rb8+ Ka7 24. Rb7+ Ka8 25. Rxc7+ Kb8 26. Rb7+ Kc8 27. Nd6+ Kd8 28. Ne2 (all moves quite forced. from this point on, I was thinking about a lot of possible moves... but I think I would still have had an advantage)} 24. Na4+ Kc4 25. b3+ Kd4 {...Qxb3 would have been the option to live a little longer... but black was lost anyway.} 26. Rb4# {isn't this a nice mate-picture? ;-)}
