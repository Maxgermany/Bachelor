1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch Game, leading to open, gambit-style positions. It was a great favourite in the 19th century but languished in relative neglect until kasparov revived it.} exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {A different way to counter the scotch game is 4...Bc5 5 Be3 Qf6 6 c3 Nge7 7 Bc4 And Now either 7...Ne5 8 Be2 Qg6 9 0-0 d5 10 Bh5 Ehlvest-Beilavsky, Reykjavik 1991 or alternatively 7...Qg6 8 Nxc6 Qxc6 9 Bxf7 Kxf7 10 Qh5+ Ng6 11 Qf5+ Ke8 12 Qxc5 And white on to win in Ivanchuk-Gulko, Reykjavik 1991.} 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. e5 Qe7 7. Qe2 Nd5 8. c4 {8...Nb6 9 Nd2 Qe6 10 b3 a5 11 Bb2 Was played in Kasparov-Karpov, World Championship (Game 16) 1990.} Ba6 9. b3 g6 {A risky continuation was seen in Kasparov-Karpov, World Championship (Game 14) 1990- 9...0-0-0 10 g3 Re8 11 Bb2 f6.} 10. f4 {Kasparov's prepared improvement over 10 Bb2 Bg7 11 Nd2 Nb4 12 Nf3 c5 13 g3 0-0 Hjartarson-Portisch, Reykjavik 1991. Kasparov perceives more lucrative perspectives for his Queen's Bishop On a3 rather then b2.} f6 11. Ba3 Qf7 12. Qd2 Nb6 13. c5 Bxf1 14. cxb6 axb6 {A spirited piece sacrifice,intending to meet 15 Rxf1 with 15 Bxa3 or the more plausible 15 Bxf8 with 15... Rxf8 16 Rxf1 fxe5 when black has a rock solid position plus two good pawns for his sacrifice piece. Yet another Possibility after 15 Bxf8 is Bxg2 16 Qxg2 Rxf8 followed by ...0-0-0. Nevertheless, Kasparov has a brilliant riposte that cuts across Black's Plans...} 15. e6 {!!   The point of this intermezzo is that now 15...Qxe6+ would fail to 16 Kxf1 Bxa3 17 Nxa3 Rxa3 18 Re1 devilishly netting the black Queen.} dxe6 {This way White still wins the piece But by virtue of his splendid 15th move he shreds Black's pawn structure and prevents Black from castling Queenside.} 16. Bxf8 Rd8 17. Qb2 {A highly original position, possibly unique in the annals of chess in which both players simultaneously have a Queen's bishop on the starting square of their opponent's king bishop.} Bxg2 18. Qxg2 Kxf8 19. Qxc6 Rd6 20. Qc3 Kg7 21. Nd2 Rhd8 22. O-O-O Qe8 {Up to now Karpov has maintained a measure of compensation for his lost piece but if he wanted To continue resistance he had to play here 22...Qd7. The text is a miscalculation overlooking the fact that white can safely snatch one more pawn.} 23. Qxc7+ Rd8d7 24. Qc2 Qb8 25. Nc4 Rd6d5 26. Qf2 Qc7 27. Qxb6 {Black's case is hopeless since Kasparov not only has an extra knight but a armada of passed pawns on the queen's wing.} Qxf4+ 28. Qe3 Qg4 29. Rdg1 Qh4 30. Rg3 e5 31. Rh3 Qg4 32. Rg1 Rd5d1+ 33. Rxd1 Qxd1+ 34. Kb2 h5 35. Rg3 Qh1 36. Qf2 h4 {It can only Been a Desperate shortage of time that prevented karpov's resignation at this point.} 37. Qg2 Qxg2+ 38. Rxg2 g5 39. a4 {The Pawn forces Black's resignation.} Kg6 40. a5 e4 41. b4 h3 42. Rg3 Rh7 43. a6 f5 44. Ra3 {black resigned.}
