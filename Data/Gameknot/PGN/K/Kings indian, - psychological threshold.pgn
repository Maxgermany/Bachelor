1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. h4 {Pretty straightforward move. In always every situation where enemy king fianchettos, one easy way to attack there is through exchanging black bishops(Be3 Qe2 and to h6.) After doing that h4 moves effect will be much more powerful, you only not open your way to rook, but also give a place for queen to h6 early. Simple tactic but effective.} Nbd7 6. Be2 O-O 7. h5 c5 8. hxg6 {8.h6 is quite good move too. Imagine how annoying it would be for black. Even I often hesitate whether going h6 or exchange, here h6 seems better choise.} fxg6 {It may not make much difference but slightly better is hxg6 since its already weak anyway(h line). Rook can get out later anytime. Black should concentrate first getting his white bishop out, wh√≠ch never moves durning the game btw.} 9. Nf3 {I'd rather avoid the cxd by d5, e6 gives no harm to your structure.} cxd4 10. Nxd4 Ne5 11. Bf4 {This way you'll be left in enemy rooks meal box(11...Nxe5,12.Nxe5 12...Rxf4  leaving pawn up)I understant this position is difficult to develop bishop so you gotta leave it to later,g5 and d2 are the only good spots but there is better moves to offer.------------------- F4 followed by f5 is one interesting idea. One thing you must also note is that you can still castle. It may be hard to admit, but your opening plan didnt work too well. This is the one big psychologial difficulty where it is hard to see such move. since you did manage to reach free way for your rook. you must still watch every position through different perspection. early castling is good for almost everywhere :)} Qc7 {11..Nxe4!........} 12. Qb3 {E4 pawn is still there.} Qc5 13. O-O-O Nc6 14. Be3 Qe5 {You've got some advantage now, thanks to blacks bad queen moves.} 15. Nf3 Qe6 16. Ng5 Qe5 17. Nd5 {F4 was good move for long but  move 17 was the best time to use it.(and then hidden check in move c5)  sometimes it may be bad idea driving queen away but for the most of the time it gives great advantage in development.} Nxd5 {18.Rxd5! 19..Qf6 20.Nxh7 another mind trick since its usually more safe to take with pawns} 18. cxd5 Na5 19. Qb4 b6 20. Rxh7 {Pretty dangerous stuff. now need to be extra careful.} Rxf2 {21.Rxg7!! makes his sacrifice vain. and if king takes rook then Bd5!} 21. Qd2 Rxg2 {Rook e1 or something to cover bishop. game is pretty much over anyway.} 22. Nf3 Qxb2+ {A Good lesson might be that" positional eye can be deceptive"}
