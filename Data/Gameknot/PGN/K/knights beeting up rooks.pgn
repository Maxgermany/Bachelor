[Opening "Sicilian (B22), Alapin's variation (2.c3)"]

1. e4 c5 {I like to play the sicilian, though I do not know the theory behind it in depth.} 2. c3 Nc6 3. Qh5 {My opponent had a higher rating, and was perhaps trying to grab an early pawn by this move. This move is almost insulting, but I calmly continued with my development.} e6 4. Nf3 Nf6 {forking the queen and the pawn on e4.} 5. Qg5 {I thought about Nxe4 followed by the trade of queens, but I decided to try and free up my light squared bishop and make a push for the center.} d5 6. e5 Nd7 {My only real move here. Ne4 leads to the queen trade and then d3 wins my knight.} 7. d4 {defending the pawn in preparation for the queen trade} cxd4 {perhaps it would have been better for me to initiate the queen trade, and then trade pawns, but I thought my king was pretty safe in the middle with the center locked up and no queens on the board.} 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. cxd4 Bb4+ {developing with tempo on the king.} 10. Bd2 a5 {I thought maybe I could open up the a file a bit, but white was behind in development and wanted to castle.} 11. Bd3 b6 {giving my bishop a line for development} 12. Ng5 {Obviously threatening the fork on e7, but the center is left ungaurded. Also, once the knight grabs the rook it is stuck in the corner. I decided that I did not mind losing my rook.} Ba6 {Forces the trade of bishops, eliminating a possible escape of the knight if white goes for the fork. This also improves black's position because a bad bishop is traded for a more powerful one. For white, taking on h7 opens a file and allows the rook to escape the impending fork. Bc4 is not a good option because the bishop on a6 would prevent the castle. Black would also gain a pawn and tempo after Nxd4.} 13. Bxa6 Rxa6 14. Nxf7+ Ke7 15. Nxh8 Bxd2+ 16. Nxd2 {Another trade of a bad bishop for a relatively more powerful one.} Nxd4 {threatening my own fork on c2} 17. O-O Nxe5 {My knights are centralized and I'm about to get rid of that dead knight on h8. I probably could have left the knight trapped in prison in hindsight, but if white were to somehow get the f pawn out of the way, the knight can be sprung.} 18. Rfe1 Nd3 19. Ref1 {A waste of time for white, I was expecting white to try to take advantage of my lined up knights on the d file, but his own knight is more or less dominated, and a simple check makes it possible to save my knights anyway.} Ra8 20. Ng6+ hxg6 21. b3 a4 {pushing the attack. I'm not sure what I would have done if white didn't trade pawns. My only rook would have been committed to defending that a pawn. An open b file might have been a critical weekness. I probably should have grabbed the open c file with my rook.} 22. bxa4 {luckily white took the bait and went for the trade giving me another passed pawn.} Rxa4 23. g3 b5 24. Kg2 b4 25. Nf3 Nxf3 26. Kxf3 Ne5+ 27. Kg2 d4 28. Rfe1 Kd6 29. Re2 Ra3 30. Rb2 Kc5 {Defending my pawn. I anticipated white's next move, and I could respond by blocking with my rook and getting my pawns closer to their goal.} 31. Rc1+ Rc3 32. Rxc3+ dxc3 {I took with the d pawn in order to keep white's a pawn from running free.} 33. Rc2 Kc4 34. Kf1 Kd3 35. Rc1 Nf3 {I probably could have done something to hold on to the knight, but it's a meaningless piece since I will be able to get rid of the rook by promoting one pawn, and then promote the other.} 36. Kg2 {Rd1+ was probably a better move for white} Kd2 37. Ra1 c2 38. Kxf3 c1=Q 39. Rxc1 Kxc1 40. Ke3 Kb2 41. a4 {perhaps thinking that I forgot about the en passant rule} bxa3 e.p. 42. Kd4 a2 43. Ke5 a1=Q 44. Kxe6 Qe1+ 45. Kf7 Qxf2+ 46. Kxg7 Qxh2 47. Kxg6 Qxg3+ {after eating up all the pawns it is only a matter of forcing the king to the edge for the checkmate.}
