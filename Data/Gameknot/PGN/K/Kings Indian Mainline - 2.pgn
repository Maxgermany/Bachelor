1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 Bg7 4. d4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 {based opening of the tournament.} 9. b4 {i see no better option, for white, than to follow the nature of this opening.} Nh5 {black has to counterplay fast} 10. Re1 f5 {this is black objective, to open king-side.} 11. Ng5 Nf6 12. f3 h6 13. Ne6 {a strange but canonic way to close king-side.} Bxe6 14. dxe6 c6 15. Be3 Ne8 16. Qd2 f4 17. Bf2 Qc8 {looks like white loses a pawn.} 18. c5 Qxe6 19. cxd6 Qxd6 20. Bc4+ {Hey, you lose your q...  Ah, no, there is check :-)} Kh8 21. Red1 {white kindly offered a way to draw, here. White could have been glad with it. But I guess matt did want to take revenge for previous game. Fair enough.} Rd8 22. Qb2 Qc7 23. Rxd8 Qxd8 24. Bxa7 {recuperate the pawn, but with a risky move for the bishop. } b6 {will it be trap? I had calculated this as safe... What about you?} 25. Qf2 Nd6 {I had thought about Nc8, then Bb8 and eventually a draw position.} 26. Bxb6 {here i recuperate a pawn, and start to imagine a possible win.} Qa8 27. Be2 {willing to keep both bishops.} Nb7 28. a3 Nc8 29. Bc5 {nothing convincing with Bc7} Rd8 30. Bc4 Ncd6 31. Bb3 {the fear, is to finish with opposite bishops, that would lead to a draw.} Nb5 32. Nxb5 cxb5 33. Bd5 Qc8 34. Bxb7 {avoiding the different bishop ending.} Qxb7 35. Qe2 Qd7 {good thinking: now black is on the move... And, late, I realize my king is not so cool} 36. Kf1 Bf6 37. Ke1 Bh4+ {alarm call.} 38. Bf2 {only defense} Qd4 {God damn! Now, if Bxh4, then Qxa1 + recuperates the bishop + threats a fast Rd2 possibility...} 39. Rc1 {only defense, again...} Bxf2+ 40. Qxf2 Qd3 41. Qb2 {I needed to keep my pawn up to try to find counter-game, because, now, black is on the lead, clearly!} Qe3+ 42. Kf1 {Once again, black could have the draw anytime} Rd4 {yes: my counter attack was lead by the ideas Qxe5 and Rc7... Of course, I could have hoped for that kind of dream.} 43. Re1 {chasing back} Qd3+ 44. Kg1 Kg7 45. h4 {to create a bubble of oxygen, in case of attack on the first line. } Kf6 {now, black is safe from my own attack.} 46. Re2 {thanks to h4, the first line is no more a dead threat, but I needed to recuperate some column} g5 {good thinking: if i take, the king comes to participate to the pressing, if I play h5, then g5 is destroying the infrastructure.} 47. hxg5+ {well, let the king pass...} Kxg5 48. Kh2 {but not to close... With the king on h4, then g3, it would have become too sweaty.} h5 49. Qa2 {I needed some threat too} Rc4 50. Rd2 Qf1 {And first line si again a deadly trap.} 51. Rc2 {rook cannot pass... But rook is also a vital protection against my queen. So it cannot takes my rook or go on d4} h4 {I thought black just made a timing move, "paying to see".} 52. Rxc4 bxc4 {i calculated that my pawn would arrive first, and safe, due to the black queen and the white queen positions.} 53. b5 h3 {but black had a counter-attack...} 54. b6 Qe1 {a beaty!} 55. gxh3 {after having played that move, i was wondering: wouldn't it have paid to play b7?! Qg3 56 Rg1, but then Qe1 leads to the draw, anyway. And 56 ... h2 is not better.} Qg3+ 56. Kh1 Qe1+ 57. Kg2 Qg3+ 58. Kh1 Qe1+ 59. Kh2 {I offered draw... He accepted. Of course, black could not take any of my pawn: it would have permitted a system with my queen back on protection... and my b pawn goes to queen...  Good, interesting game...}
