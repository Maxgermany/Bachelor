[Black "unknown (100ish)"]
[Opening "Bird's opening (A03)"]

1. f4 {this move characterises Birds opening and is alot better than it looks. whites usual plan is to control the central dark squares with moves such as e3, Nf3 and Bb2. it also has surprise value which, in over the board games such as this one, comes into play. i decided to play this against my young (14ish) opponent so to test his knowledge of the opening not just his opening theory which most rely on.} d5 {the move most people play, seems most natural however it plays into whites plans of dark square control. c5 with a later more restrained d6 is a bigger test where white does best to swich plans to light square control following moves like g3, Bg2 and d3.} 2. e3 Nf6 3. Nf3 {b3 is slightly more accurate} e6 {a bit passive but still fine. most people prefer to develop the bishop outside the pawn chain, although it is prehaps no stronger than the game it will give black a slightly less cramped position} 4. b3 {continuing the plan of dark square control} Bd6 {not sure exactly what the bishop achieves here, e7 would be a more normal choice} 5. Bb2 c5 {grabing space on the queenside a logical plan after an early e6 as black has few prospects on the kingside} 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. Bb5 {the bishop creates an annoying pin while my queens knight heads over to the kingside, where im aiming to play.} Bd7 8. Ne2 Qa5 {trying to chase the bishop away} 9. c4 {after Bd3 b5 blacks queenside pawns are rolling} dxc4 10. Bxc4 Rb8 {not sure why this was played, an imediate b5 is better, then the rook can pick its best square later on instead of commiting itself to b8 so early} 11. O-O b5 12. Bd3 Nb4 13. Bb1 {preserving my bishop pair which quite nicely control the centre and pressure the black kingside} O-O 14. a3 {kicking the knight back where it came from so i can use my queen to increase pressure on the black kingside} Nc6 {Nd5 fails for tactical reasons involving the e pawn advancing e3-e4-e5. i wont bore you with the variations.} 15. Ng5 {stepping up the kingside pressure, an imediate Qc2 would have been stronger. i had planned to sac the knight if black had played h6 here with something like Ng3} e5 {? adding tension the black position can't handle. lets take a quick look at the position here, the white bishops are very powerful, controlling the centre and pressuring the black kingside. compare to blacks bishops who arent very active at all. the black queen is horribly positioned on a5 with very little scope to get over to the kingside where she is needed. the white queen however can easily access any part of the board via c2 or to the kingside after the knight moves to g3. all this suggests that black should not be trying to add tension to the position, his pieces arent in a position to handle it.} 16. Qc2 {now blacks postion is under to much pressure, something must give. white is threatening fxe5 followed by Rxf6 and if the pawn on e5 moves then Bxf6 is powerful} g6 {?? weakening the dark squares and losing a piece, but Black is struggling to find a move that doesn't lose here} 17. fxe5 Bxe5 18. Rxf6 {i'd rather keep my dark squared bishop, ive got  a second rook that can be posted on the f file but i don't have another dark squared bishop to point at the holes in the black kingside. also if he chooses to exchange the bishops instead of capturing the rook my queen will be more actively placed and blacks knight not as good as after 18. Bxe5 Nxe5 19.Rxf6} Bxf6 {black takes the materialistic view and captures the rook} 19. Bxf6 Rfe8 20. Qb2 {lining up on the long diagonal} Rxe3 {?? loses to many moves like Bc3 or b4, playing for the cheapo but im really not gonna fall for dxe3 Qe1# now am I} 21. Bh8 {i felt this was slightly stronger than simply winning the rook with b4} Ne5 {Nd4 is prehaps slightly better but at this stage its all oneway traffic} 22. Bxe5 Rxe5 23. Qxe5 {now im up a whole 2 pieces for a single pawn the game is effectively over} Rf8 {i was expecting Re8 when Qc3 keeps hold of the e2 knight} 24. Qc3 {? i don't like this move. its motivated by my desire to simplify but only allows him to relocate his queen from that awful square its on now.} Qc7 {blacks queen looks much better here} 25. Be4 {improving my bishops position and allowing my rook to enter the game} Re8 26. d3 Bg4 27. Ng3 Qf4 {giving up 2 more pawns for some play i probably shouldn't have accepted but i couldn't see any winning lines for black after i take the pawns} 28. Qxc5 {so i took them} Rc8 29. Qxb5 Qe3+ 30. Kf1 Rc2 {?? ooops, looks threatning unfortunatly i have a forced mate...} 31. Qe8+ Kg7 32. Qxf7+ Kh6 33. Qxh7+ Kxg5 34. Qxg6+ Kh4 35. Qf6+ {and black resigns. although not part of the quickest mating combination it forces the queens off which means all of blacks play will be gone. there was a better move than Qf6  which leads to mate in 3. see if you can spot it...}
