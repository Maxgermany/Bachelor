[Opening "KGA (C34), Fischer defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 {Ah, the King's Gambit! Favoured by those dashing 19th Century players who love to swamp their opponents with attacking play. I have come unstuck against this opening, to my frustration and bafflement, so many times. But happily not here.} exf4 {I've lost so often by accepting the pawn I've taken to declining it, though not with the usual 2...Bc5 but with 2...Nc6, which sometimes throws my opponent. This time, I decided to take my chances.} 3. Nf3 {White doesn't have to play this, but it's more usual than allowing 3...Qh4+} d6 {When Bobby Fischer wrote his 'Bust to the King's Gambit' it was this modest little move he was thinking of, instead of defending the pawn immediately with 3...g5. But this move alone doesn't guarantee Black an easy ride at all. White still gets to develop dangerously. It does, however, stop the Knight from going to e5, which I guess is the main idea.} 4. Bc4 {The idea is to develop quickly and hit Black's weak f7 square, while Black is trying to hang onto his pawn.} h6 {Preparing to defend the won pawn with 5...g5.} 5. d4 {Now White has claimed the centre and is threatening Black's extra pawn. But he could, first, have played 5.h4, preventing 5...g5. Then Black would probably have to get his pieces out...5...Nf6 6.Nc3 Nc6 and White has potentially nasty pawn advances.} g5 {But I let White have his big centre and try to cling to the extra pawn. This is, after all, the point of accepting the gambit.} 6. O-O {White's position looks good and he's ahead in development. But the potential attack on f7 down the f-file is rather stymied, and now he's castled I'm fairly sure he isn't going to be playing h4.} Bg7 {It's time to get my own pieces into play, and this is the natural starter.} 7. c3 {Getting ready to bring the Queen to b3, where White can resume his attack on f7 along the diagonal.} Nc6 8. Bb5 {I think White has faltered here, rather changing plan. He has to make the most of his extra move and the tempo gained when Black captured his f-pawn. If he wanted to pin the Knight he could have done it with 8.Qa4, at least getting the Queen out too.} a6 {Immediately challenging the Bishop is probably best, and since going back to c5 the Bishop can be hit again with 9...b5 White has a choice to make.} 9. Bxc6+ {Probably not best, giving up the Bishop after three moves, even though it does double my pawns.} bxc6 10. Nbd2 {White starts developing his other pieces. This supports the Knight on f3 in case of a pin, and maybe White is eyeing c4 too?} Bg4 {I pin the Knight anyway, though 10...Nf6 so I can castle might have been better.} 11. Qa4 {Attacking the undefended pawn on c6. } Bd7 {Now it's my turn to waste a move. For some reason, the natural 11...Ne7, which defended the pawn just as well and allowed castling, didn't occur to me.} 12. Qc4 {Not the best square for the Queen, since I can advance the c-pawn and then that b5-f1 diagonal looks good for my Bishop.} Nf6 {First, though, and rather belatedly in fact, I want my King out of the centre. Rather inviting 13.e5 though.} 13. Re1 {Now castling really is a priority!} O-O {So I do.} 14. Nb3 {I'm starting to feel my position is solid, despite those central pawns. For this reason I don't advance the g-pawn to drive away the Knight. Instead, I worry, as I often do, about those doubles pawns.} d5 15. exd5 cxd5 {And they're gone!} 16. Qe2 {16.Qd3 is better, withg that long diagonal to play with. Here I can just attack the Queen again...} Re8 17. Qd1 {Posting my Knight on e4 is tempting...} Bg4 {But first I tempt White to exchange Rooks, to give me control of the e-file.} 18. Rxe8+ Qxe8 19. Nbd2 {White defends the Knight on f3 at the cost of blocking in his Bishop, when there was a nice outpost on c5 going spare.} Ne4 {Now I play my Knight forward. There are all manner of tactical possibilities occuring to me now. I want to bring my Rook onto the b-file to attack the bpawn when the Bishop moves, for example. I'm also threatening to open up White's King's position by first exchanging on d2 and then on f3. But would that be best? I have two strongly placed minor pieces and it seems a shame to exchange them off.} 20. Qf1 {White unpins the Knight, and keeps my Rook defending my a-pawn. Both plans scuppered with one move!} a5 {Perhaps a loss of tempo, but at least it frees my Rook to go to the half-open b-file.} 21. a4 {Perhaps White is worried by my pawn's advance and doesn't see the real reason for my previous move?} Rb8 {Now the Bishop on c1 is tied to defending the b-pawn for now.} 22. h3 {Trying to drive away the Bishop, but this just gives me a nice square for the Knight...} Ng3 {The Queen must move, and I'm thinking about how to bring my own Queen into the attack.} 23. Qd3 Bxf3 {No sense in retreating, so I exchange.} 24. Nxf3 {24...Qxf3 Qe1+ is nasty for White. But now I see that the b-pawn my Rook has been eyeing can fall..} Ne2+ 25. Kh2 Nxc1 26. Rxc1 Rxb2 {I've rather diluted my attack, but am now two pawns to the good and have my Rook on the 7th.} 27. Re1 {I thought White would defend his a-pawn here, but he hasn't...} Qxa4 {So it's mine.} 28. Re7 {I see his plan; he gives me a pawn to get my Queen away from the defence.} Qc2 {Perhaps White was hoping for the more dangerous looking 28...Qa2? But 29.Qg3! means I am probably lost. With the Queen here, White must exchange to avoid the mate on g2.} 29. Qxc2 Rxc2 30. Rxc7 {The White Rook can mop up a few pawns, but so can I.} a4 31. Ra7 Rxc3 32. Rxa4 Rc4 {I was hoping to be able to win another pawn here, but I'd overlooked the reply. However, I will still be left with a strong, possibly won position...} 33. Ra5 Bxd4 34. Rxd5 Be3 {That line of pawns with the Bishop on the end has been there since early in the game, the direct result of the accepted gambit.} 35. Rd7 {White is trying to keep my King out of the game, but he hasn't seen a danger...} Rc1 {Here I get a stroke of luck, as the White Knight leaves the g1 square undefended and goes to help the Rook win my pawn on f7. Fatal...} 36. Ne5 Bg1+ {Initially I was thinking simply of a sicovered check to win the Knight...} 37. Kh1 {But now I see a better move than 37...Bd4+...} Bf2+ 38. Kh2 Bg3# {And mate. Possibly the first time I've won against this very tricky gambit, still dangerous after all these years, whatever Bobby Fischer said.}
