1. d4 {Well, recently after hitting my 6 month personal best and finally breaking 1300 I decided that I was hot shit and took on more games...so now my ratting is crashing like the NSX...well OK, its not that bad.  Anyways, this was a pretty good game I had with pastordon until I started to loose focus, very frustrating.} d5 2. c4 {Queens gambit, Decide to accept, not having a lot of experience with this opening.} dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 c5 5. Bxc4 {So here black has set up a typical queens gambit...I think.  I remember getting a little bit worried here thinking that he certainly had the upper hand this early in the game...I don't really know any of the openings used to counter the QG} e6 {I did this is prevent Nf5 at some point, and because its just a general common sense opening move.} 6. O-O Bd6 {Making room to cast and staking out my share of the center.} 7. Nc3 {This had me getting worried, fearing some sort of e5 fork.} a6 {I decided to attack his flanks because it looked to me like a fight for the center would go to him.} 8. d5 b5 {I decide to try his bishop, fearing that he would attack with his d pawn anyways, although in hindsight it doesn't look to be such a threat.} 9. Bb3 {White pulls back and I breathe a sigh of releaf (no idea how to spell that) and pick up some momentum} O-O {I decide to use my tempo for the castle} 10. h3 {And white plays what I feel to be a questionable move, obviously fearing an attacking on h2} b4 11. Ne2 {I think white would have been better off to have done this last move} Qe7 12. Ba4 Bd7 13. Bb3 exd5 {I was pretty surprised that he let me win that pawn} 14. Re1 {White is starting to set up some heavy  E D presure} Nc6 {Fearing infiltration by horseback I dispatch my knight} 15. a3 a5 16. Nf4 {I was really hopping that he would trade rooks on the a file, but obviously he knew better} c4 17. Ba4 Ne5 {This move took me quite a while to figure out, but I was pretty happy for the chance to trade off one of his knights} 18. Bc2 b3 {I was really enjoying this pawn push, thinking that I was pretty smokin stuff} 19. Bb1 {I was expecting him to either fall all the way back as he did or to sac for h7 to generate some movement...obviously he made the right choice.} a4 {This was probably a wasted move} 20. e4 {This move pretty much set of the central exchange, which I wasn't really about, but had been building for a while} Nxf3+ 21. Qxf3 Bc6 22. Qe2 Rac8 23. Bd2 dxe4 24. Qxc4 Bxf4 25. Bxf4 Rfe8 26. f3 Qa7+ {I think this was a bad move...seemed kind of useless} 27. Be3 Qa5 28. Bxe4 Bxe4 29. Qb4 Qa8 30. fxe4 Rxe4 {This also may have been the wrong probably a little to aggresive} 31. Qd6 Re6 32. Qg3 Ne4 33. Qg4 {I can already tell I'm screwed, my rook is out of possition and the knight is in trouble} Qa5 34. Bd4 f6 35. Rxe4 Rxe4 36. Qxe4 Rd8 37. Bc3 Qa7+ {I was trying to do anything to break out, but his possition was very good and left me no where to break him} 38. Kh1 Qf2 39. Qg4 Kh8 40. Re1 h5 {and I blunder, a shure sign that I have lost focus} 41. Qxh5+ Kg8 42. Qg4 Qa7 43. Bxf6 Rd2 44. Re7 Rd1+ 45. Qxd1 Qxe7 {and I resign, the rook attack was a desperate move that I figured was worth a shot.  }
