1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 {I have played a number of different lines against the French but the KIA is one of the easiest to play in blitz chess.  It has a limited number of plans for white.  } c5 4. g3 Nc6 5. Bg2 d4 {The opening now takes on the characteristics of a King's Indian reversed but black is an extra tempo down since e6 followed by e5 at some point is a tempo more than white usually expends.} 6. Ngf3 e5 7. Nc4 {Threatening the e5 pawn and opening the black squared bishop's diagonal.} Qc7 8. a4 {a4 was played to secure knight post on c4.} Be6 9. b3 {White won't mind if black exchanges his good bishop for the knight but he wants to recapture with the b pawn.} Bxc4 10. bxc4 Bd6 11. O-O Nf6 {Black has lead in development but the position is closed.} 12. h3 {this prevents Ng4 and sets up a way for white to advance the f pawn.} O-O 13. Nh2 {I think black could have castled queenside since white doesn't have enough space on the queen's wing to mount an attack currently.  ( I could be wrong about that if you would help me out with your opinion I would appreciate it. )  If black still had the bishop on e6, white would need find a different way to get f4 in.  If black could play Qd7 the pawn on h3 would hang and the replies for white are not all that appealing. } Nd7 14. f4 {White has finally gotten in f4 and can start a pawn storm.} Rae8 15. f5 f6 {Temporarily stopping f6 but white may have a new pawn level now. } 16. g4 Rf7 17. h4 {I thought black was doubling rooks on the f file but he really wanted to support g6. } g6 18. g5 fxg5 19. hxg5 Nf8 {If white plays 20. f5xg6 then black plays Nxg6 and there is no attack - black can defend. If white plays 20. f6 the position becomes blocked and white won't make progress.  So white must find a way to increase the pressure. } 20. Ng4 {This threatens the fork at 21. h6 so  } Kh8 21. Nh6 {Black moves the king to get out of the fork and white chases the rook away. } Rd7 22. Bh3 {The bishop move threatens 23. f5xg6 discovering on the rook.  But while black might lose a pawn  ( 23. f5xg6 Rg7  24. g6xh7 Rxh7 ) there is some question in my mind whose king worse off.   } Rdd8 {Black avoids the discovery. } 23. fxg6 {White now threatens to win the exchange with Nf7ch, but that is the least of threats because the 7th rank is weak.} Rdb8 24. Rf7 {The threat is to the queen or mate with g7.  } Re7 25. g7# {Kind of an odd finish. White has three pieces that never moved and checkmates with a pawn.  I hope you enjoy the game, please rate and any comments would be appreciated.}
