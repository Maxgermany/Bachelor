[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 {Bishop's Opening, Berlin Defense} 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d3 Bb4 5. Nf3 d5 {White's knight on c3 is pinned, so the center exchange is equal. Black is trying to open up the center. I expect Pxd5 because if the Bishop retreats, d4 wins the pinned knight.} 6. O-O dxc4 {Now that was not what black had expected.} 7. a3 Bxc3 {Maintaining the full material advantage. If Black retreats the bishop, white can play Pxc4 and black is only up by the exchange of pawn for bishop. This move allows Pxd3, exchanging the pawn rather than outright losing it.} 8. bxc3 cxd3 9. Qxd3 O-O {I had not expected white to be so willing to trade queens when he was down in material. Better for white would have been 9. pxd3 to fix his pawn structure and avoid exchanging queens. But taking the queen now would allow white to fix that doubled isolated pair of pawns on the C file. As much as I wanted to trade queens, I wanted to keep white's queen-side pawn structure in ruins even more.} 10. Qxd8 Rxd8 {And white played the exchange anyway. Every exchange consolodates black's material advantage. This move also puts the black rook on the only open file.} 11. Bg5 Rd6 {My knight is hungry for that e Pawn. But not while it is pinned to my rook. I expected white to defend that e Pawn now with one of his rooks (f1 would be best, leaving the a1 rook to deploy to the open D file of the half-open B file).} 12. h3 h6 {I don't know why white played h3. Sure, he doesn't want black's bishop on g4, but saving his pawn was even more important, I think. As for black's move, I should have taken that e Pawn, which forks the bishop and the pawn on c3, letting me trade next move with Nxg5. A pawn and a favorable bishop exchange. I should have taken it. Not sure what I was thinking here with h6.} 13. Be3 Be6 {Now black can take the e pawn that I should have taken last move. But, it seems fairly indefensible, so I can take it later. I am planning an attack instead, beginning with doubling my rooks on the open file.} 14. Rab1 b6 15. Rb5 Nxe4 {Now black eats the e pawn (finally) and threatens the c3 pawn. White cannot seem to save it. In retrospect, black's better move here would have been Bc4 forking the two rooks. I moved too quickly - I had my sights on the e pawn and didn't really consider the alternatives. White's best move now would be 16 Nxe5, claiming a pawn for himself.} 16. Kh2 f6 {I am not sue why white chose to move his King. He later told me he didn't see anything better (Nxe5 would have been better). That pawn on c3 is still tempting, but it isn't going anywhere and black can take it at his leisure, so first black defends his pawn on e5.} 17. Rfb1 Nxc3 {A bad move for white. He wanted to double his rooks on the half-open file, but this was not the right time or place for it. Now he loses the exchange. After two moves when I missed an obvious fork, white shows me a different way to fork those rooks.} 18. Nd2 Nxb5 19. Rxb5 Nd4 {More forks from the black knights. Black has sensed that white has difficulties accounting for the peculiar moves of knights. Rb2 is weak, retreating the rook to defensive duty. Bxd4 is weak, exchanging when white is greatly disadvantaged in material. Anything else loses a rook or a pawn.} 20. Rb4 Nxc2 21. Re4 Nxe3 {5 consecutive knight moves, 4 of which are captures.} 22. Rxe3 Rxd2 {First the knight eats the unprotected pawn. Then, since the bishop is the only piece defending the knight, black can take the bishop free of charge. White either exchanges the knights or he doesn't (white chose the exchange, generally a bad idea, but black's knights have eaten him alive, so maybe he's safer getting them off the board for good.)} 23. Rf3 Rad8 24. a4 Rd8d3 {Forces the rook exchange. White has nowhere to retreat. This eliminates the last of white's pieces, leaving an impossible endgame for white.} 25. Rxd3 Rxd3 26. g3 Kf7 {There are many ways for black to win. The easiest is probably promoting the c pawn. White cannot stop it as long as black keeps his rook on the D file and defends the rook against white's king. But, white had said something to me about wanting to see how I finished out the game, so I was determined not to promote any pawns. This dragged it out a bit, but I felt it provided a more instructional ending for white.} 27. Kg2 Kg6 28. h4 Kf5 29. Kh3 g5 {Move the king up (he's crucial to a checkmate with lesser pieces) and also clear out the white pawns. That's the plan. White doesn't have anything really good. h5 might have stalled black a little longer.} 30. Kh2 gxh4 31. gxh4 Kg4 32. Kg2 Bd5+ {It's not about eating pawns now. That pawn on h4 is safe from black - I have better things to do.} 33. f3+ Rxf3 {Blocking with the pawn was the wrong answer, but white has nothing else anyway. I choose to capture with the rook because it limits the white king to just 4 squares, and two moves from now he will have only 2 squares.} 34. h5 Rf5+ 35. Kh2 Rf2+ 36. Kg1 Kg3 {This would be stalemate, except for the white pawn on a4. After white moves his pawn to a5, black cannot play Pxa5 or he gives white a draw.} 37. a5 Re2 {It's mate in 1 if white plays any pawn move. White can delay the inevitable by chasing the black rook: 38 Kf1 Rh7. Then it's a foot race with the black king chasing the white king to the far side of the board until white has no more room to run, at which point he will be checkmated on b1. } 38. a6 Re1# {38 a6 was instant death for white, as would have been 38 Pxb6. Kf1 lets white live for 6 more moves, but I think white was just ready to call it a day.}
