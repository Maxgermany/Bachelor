1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d3 d5 4. Nbd2 Nc6 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 {The books say this move is not to be recommended due to a potential fork threat on e5.  Instead,  ..Be7 is more usual.} 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 Qc7 9. Qe2 dxe4 10. dxe4 e5 {This leaves a hole at d5 which White is able to exploit shortly.  In fact, Black's pawn structure has two permanent holes (d5 and d6).  Also, the text makes the Bd6 really bad (as stated above, it probably shouldn't be there in the first place).  Perhaps playing for ..b6 and ..Bb7 was the best way to continue.} 11. c3 {The advantage of the text is that it prevents ..Nd4.  Of course, the disadvantage is that it leaves a hole at d3.  Still, White's structure has just that one hole, compared to the two for Black.} h6 {I still think Black has to do something about his Bc8.  } 12. Nc4 Be7 13. Nh4 {Destination is f5 and hopes of a "brilliant" Fischer-like King's Indian Attack.} g5 {Whoa!  This is either awfully ambitious or an overreaction to White's kingside activities.  It looks terribly risky to me to weaken the kingside to this extent.} 14. Nf5 Kh7 {Appears to be forced, as 14.. Bxf5, 15 exf5 would seem to put tremendous pressure on both Black's e5 pawn (I don't think it can be held) and would open up the long diagonal for White's Bg2.} 15. Nce3 Be6 16. Nd5 Qd7 {I think 16.. Bxd5 was best, though that still leads to the loss of the e5 pawn and a likely win for White.  In this position I thought quite a bit about how to continue the attack.  I knew I was much better, but couldn't figure out the best way to continue.  Then it hit me.  White can just win a piece.  Never overlook the obvious.  } 17. Nfxe7 {Black resigns because 17.. Nxe7 loses the queen to 18 Nxf6 , while 17.. Nxd5 leaves Black a piece down after 18 Nxd5.  }
