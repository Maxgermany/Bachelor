1. c4 {English opening. Please rate or type a message on this game.} Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 {Transposing into A King Indian Defense} 3. e4 {I believe Nf3 would be stronger than e4. Playing the flank attack moves} d6 4. d4 Bg7 {The main line, also know as the Mar del Plata} 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 {The Classical variation} Nbd7 {hhmm? Is not he suppose to play e5?} 7. O-O e5 8. d5 { Petrosian System, one move behind though. Well because black played Nd7 instead of the orthodox e5. I restrict my opponent to any counter play by locking the pawn formation. This is very safe for white.} Nc5 {?! not sure if this was good} 9. Qc2 Ne8 {preparing the thematic f5 break. If you do not know King Indian Defense setups. Black plays to the king side and white plays the queen side.} 10. b4 {The bayonet attack! b4 is the start of my expansion on the queen side. Ignoring blacks counter play on the king side.} Na6 11. Rb1 {hah! two birds with one stone. I protect the b pawn and get out of the a1-h8 diagonal if it becomes open. Watch my rooks in this game} f5 12. a4 {Continuing my annexation of my enemy's territory } c5 {?! I think this is the start of his down fall. he is supposed to play king side. Nf6 double attacking my  e pawn would have been better or fxe opening the f file. Even f4 for black would be fine. Playing the king side} 13. dxc6 e.p. bxc6 {Now I have a queen side pawn majority. Taking into account that he has a backward D pawn} 14. Rd1 {Pointing my rook to his queen. Rooks belong on open files.} fxe4 15. Nxe4 Bf5 16. Bd3 Bg4 {?! what was he thinking?} 17. Ned2 Nf6 18. h3 Be6 19. Ng5 Qd7 20. Nxe6 Qxe6 21. c5 {hah! preparing to pin his queen. This combination helps me win the game} d5 {The best move?} 22. Bxa6 {Now I am ahead in material. If played correctly I have a won game} Kh8 23. b5 e4 24. Bb7 {Another combination! fork attack} Rab8 25. Bxc6 {quick bishop } e3 26. Nf3 exf2+ 27. Qxf2 Ne4 28. Qe1 Qf5 29. Rxd5 {I do not know if he seen this. He should have} Qe6 30. Rb4 {!! his knight is pinned} Ng5 {The best move?} 31. Rxg5 Qa2 {After my second win of Material I decided to to liquidate the pieces on the board to a winning end game.} 32. Qd2 Qf7 33. Bb2 Rbd8 34. Bxg7+ {A "Zwinenshoe" or a in-between move} Qxg7 35.
