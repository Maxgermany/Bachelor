1. c4 {A good game, though the decisive move could have been saved by white. But my idea of the combination was cute. I start to think I could go back to play live games with a better combination package in mind thanks to all the games i played on the net for these 6 last years that I dropped the "real games"} Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 Bg7 4. d4 {could be me, black or white...} d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 {liberating a bit the center.} 7. O-O {no way, said white} Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 {here starts the game, from the Kings Indian mainline.} 9. Bg5 {choosing an attack on the king-side, which is not the main idea with this opening, as far as I know. Though, it is not incorrect.} h6 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 {white has eliminated an offensive black piece.} 11. b4 {and now starts the attack on queen-side.} b6 12. a4 Bb7 {My only goal here was to link the rooks} 13. Qb3 {pointing clearly the attack} a6 {trying to slow down this attack} 14. c5 Bg7 {preparing my own attack.} 15. c6 {by doing this, white made a strategic mistake, I think: He blcoked his own attack on the queen-side. The compensation, aka pushing back my bishop, is really thin.} Bc8 16. b5 a5 {blocked....} 17. Nd2 f5 {my turn...} 18. exf5 Nxf5 {why not the bishop? because f5 has to serve as a heaven for the bishop, and first, I wanted to put my knight on d4...} 19. Nce4 {white blocks e5-e4 with threat on the diagonal. Clearly a good idea, but letting me accomplish my plan.} Nd4 20. Qd3 {threatening g6, but not too fast, because of possible threat on e2+} h5 21. Rae1 Bf5 {here is my bishop, pinning the knight -well unless the knight checks the king, he cannot moves.} 22. f4 {this is the move that gave me the idea of the combination that will follows. Though incorrect -leading to draw-, it gave me the win, thanks to a mistake by dear bravio.} Qe7 {first step: connect the rooks and place the queen.} 23. fxe5 {this accelerates my combination!} Bxe5 {second step: place the second bishop and prepare the place for my queen on g7} 24. Bd1 Qg7 25. Qe3 {carfeully unpinning.} Rae8 {New pin!} 26. h3 {... after a rethinking, this helps me a little bit more, because it gives me a possible place ofr my knight or bishop on g3.} Bxe4 {here comes the combo!} 27. Nxe4 Nf5 {now the queen has to choose carefully its place, because there are a lot of threats everywhere} 28. Qg5 {Qe2 and Qf2 would have been tragic mistakes. See why? This move surprised me and I consider it as !!} Bd4+ {though I decided to continue my plan!} 29. Kh2 {better than Kh1: 29.	Kh1	Rxe4 30.	Rxe4	Ng3+ 31.	Qxg3	Rxf1+ 32.	Kh2	Be5 33.	Rxe5	Qxe5 34.	Qxe5	dxe5} Qe5+ 30. Ng3 {here is the mistake: if white had played g3, I think it was a draw. Now I win a piece.. and the game.} Qxg3+ 31. Qxg3 Nxg3 32. Rxf8+ {if Kxg3, then Rxe1 wins a rook.} Rxf8 33. Re7 {again, if Kxg3, Bf2 wins a rook. This move surprised me, but is harmless.} Nf1+ 34. Kh1 Ne3 {I calculated that Bb3 was the best move. Rxc7 is pointless, as I can play 35.	Rxc7	Be5 threatning mate on f1 36.	g3	Rf1+ 37.	Kh2	Nxd5 38.	Kg2	Rxd1 and after Rd7, I play Rc1 and all is loss for white.} 35. Bf3 {not much better, but maybe resisting more time} Rf7 36. Rd7 Rxd7 {Of course! cxd is followed by Bf6, and all is said...}
