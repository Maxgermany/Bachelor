1. e4 e5 2. f4 Qh4+ {Qh4  is another way to decline the Gambit.Black gives up a tempo to confuse the position for white althought a correct play from white gives him an exellent game.} 3. g3 Qf6 {Qe7 was much accurate.Now white gets a good lead in development with no conflics.} 4. fxe5 Qxe5 5. Nc3 {Now white is simply and quietly begins to develop his pieces} Nf6 6. Bg2 {g3 has gave an opportunity not to but the bishop on c4 attacking f7 but Bg2! taking the good diagonal and playing more positionatly.} Bc5 {Blacks prevents white from castling and preparing to castle by his own.} 7. Nf3 Qe6 8. d3 {From this moment the position is much better for white to and the continuation is just improving that.} Ng4 {I would consider this move as a big blunder. 0-0 was an option.} 9. d4 {the move that black missed} Bb4 10. O-O {white is finished his development and controls the center and is all good.} b6 {too slow. and why not to castle?} 11. Nd5 {Nd5! is a big threat'o} Bd6 12. Ng5 Qg6 13. Nxf7 {Qxg4 is also winning but not winning a piece after something like h6 or f6} O-O {well man...I have to say it is too late now.} 14. Nxd6 Rxf1+ 15. Qxf1 Qh5 {Qxd6 followed by Bf4! and after Nxc7 winning the rook.The move Qh5 is hoping for nothing.now black gets mated.} 16. Ne7+ Kh8 17. Qf8# {In my oppinion Qh4 is not so bad option (only if your queen goes to e7!). But If white knows what he is doing he will be fine.just lead in development for the sacrificed pawn and dont make any "tactical beginer" dubious moves. }
