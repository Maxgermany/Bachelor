1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 {This is a rare subline. Themes will be the same as in the original, but sometimes slight differences make a game. } Bc5 {Inviting d4, in order to play Bg4, and press c3 with Ne4, etc. The "usual, smooth, nice black  plan".} 5. Nf3 Qe7 {A step ahead. Now Qe2 gives black just a painful defence. } 6. d4 {The fish bite the worm... I hope. But first, I have to take advantage from what I was playing for..} exd5+ {With check.} 7. Be2 {Keeping the Q for future action. } Bb4 {With several threats, most of them well met by... (dxf can currently be played, BxN+, bxc3, Ne4, annoying...)} 8. O-O {I have to take urgent care of the e column, and be aware of the very dangerous Ng5 by white. So I can't just go on normally, castling, Re1, and the Q has no good square to go to.  } Bxc3 9. bxc3 Ne4 {A thret is a threat. } 10. Qc2 {Now, Bf4 seems good, but in fact black gets very few compensation if ever Ng3 is allowed (NxRf1). On the other side, cxd5 would leave my N without a pawn's support. White will try to move Nf3 in order to be able to kick it with f3, so my Royalties must be guarded soon. I can't count on Be6 if g5 is not protected by a pawn. } c6 {Keep the central pawn. Any white's incursion on g5 is now parried with f6. } 11. Re1 {Of course. I can castle, but then Bd3 and my N will be pinned against the Q and... central disaster for me. } O-O {I hope this was the exact one here. } 12. cxd5 cxd5 {White can attack with c4, to which I plan to play Qc7, pinning the pawn on the Q.} 13. Bd3 {I can go for a drastic Re8, and white will have had a lot of ways to go on with the attack. On the other side, this move would have left my R undefended on e8, and my Q must be free to go. I have a serious developement problem, but I have to find the way to survive. } f5 {This leaves complete entry to g5, but I think that Qc7, again, compensates it, while minor white pieces, alone, can do no harm... (maybe!). On the other side, the obvious danger now is white moves the N so to be able to pay f3. } 14. a4 {White chooses another way: Ba3. Not the stronges move, as for...} Qc7 {With a threat on c3. I know I'm "lost" but it's up to my opponent to show it. For the time going, I know that no one of my defences will work, but white has to be very accurate. } 15. Ba3 Rd8 {Re8 self-pinned my N. } 16. c4 {That's the move... but it also gives me tempo to come, just in time...} Be6 {White should have attacked me on the b column, I think, Re-c1, Qb2, Rab1. Or go for the f3 plan. } 17. cxd5 {Thanks, white, this allows me to almost equalize. } Qxc2 18. Bxc2 Bxd5 {My N is solid and not pinned anymore, and I am ready to complete developement. White has the B pair, so it can be a good plan to try to exchange at least one of them. } 19. Bb2 {Maybe white wants to control Nc3, but this is not a threat. I think this move was a mistake. } Nc6 {Finally! Now it's a game, not a struggling fight for survival! :-)} 20. Ne5 {f3 is set. The e column is just to be taken. If I exchange, I'll have his B aiming to g2. I have to play actively and keep white distracted. Let's go on with my NxB plan.} Nb4 {Ne5 is well placed, as is mine, but none is doing anything really useful! :-)} 21. Rac1 {B pair exchange assured. } Nd2 {? Knowing that the N will be soon kicked, I moved it myself before it was a danger.} 22. Bc3 Nxc2 23. Rxc2 Ne4 {Threatening the other B, which leaves him no time for f3. Not a big deal, he can save the B. } 24. Bb2 {Now, my weakness is c7, and his is the back rank mate. It seems so far, isn't it?} Rac8 {A couple of R on the 7th rank would be too much. } 25. Rec1 {Diverted the e column penetration after f3. I can say a target was hit. } Rxc2 26. Rxc2 {A single R is more handful. But the game was deadly even, and I wanted to create some play. So I decided to allow the Rc7 penetration. } Bb3 {The idea is to simplify pawns and leet columns for my R to threat something. As for the defence, I had a risky plan. } 27. Rc7 Nd6 {Now the move that I feared was not played at all! And this means the back rank mate is still "on". } 28. Nd3 {White's strategy is Nc5 and then Ne6. This gives me some time. } Bxa4 29. Nc5 Bc6 {"Oh, my dear Damalfi, you are too naive! Don't you see that he will uncover a deadly threat on g7 by threatening your B with d5?" } 30. d5 {"Yes, master, I did. Black seems lost, and this seems exactly the kind of positions I train on Tactic Trainer (I don't intend to do any publicity). But I also saw a kind of brilliant move to solve all black's problems and to give him the victory". "Oh, did you? Well done! Now show it to me."} Ne8 {...and white resigned. Almost. } 31. Nxb7 Rxd5 {White has to spend a move saving his K, and he can't do it with his R. } 32. h3 Nxc7 {...but, in addition, now the N is also lost without hope! I swear white though he was winning most of the game...}
