1. e4 {This is the second of two games I won against tedd123. Though this game took a few more moves than the last one (32 moves this game vs 24 the previous), there was a lot of neat moves in this game that I felt worth of sharing as it worked out really well with lots of new strategy ideas. Feel free to comment and critique. } Nc6 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 {Simple development moves for white. Trying to gain center control. } f5 4. Bc4 {Black advances pawn f5, White advances Bc4, } h6 5. d3 Nf6 {So this a typical setup when I play white } 6. Bf4 fxe4 {White advances bf4, black captures fxe4. Now white has a couple of options, I can capture with my pawn or with the knight on c3. I chose to take with my pawn as I was not interested in swapping knights just yet} 7. dxe4 Bg4 8. Qd3 {Black advances bg4. White advances Qd3. Now at the time, I was very tempted to just advance pawn to h3 and force the black bishop to take the knight or retreat. However doubling up on pawns is not ideal so hence my decision to move the Queen} Nh5 9. Bd2 {black moves Nh5, attacking bishop. I retreat Bd2} Nb4 {This is when the game starts to get a little more interesting. As you can see, black looks to be having an ok game. He has several options, Nb4 is attacking the White Queen, he can also potentially move to c2 forking the King and Rook, his bishop is still threating Kf3 and his knight on the rim can easily jump back in and move to g3 for example and threaten the Rook. } 10. Bf7+ {White lost a bit of tempo and needs to make a move to regain control. In this game to do that I moved Bf7+.  My main motive was to draw the King out, keep him from castling on the King side in the near future but also capture Nb4. Black can take the bishop or move his King. If he does capture the bishop, I can easily put him back in check and capture the Knight and be in a good position possibly attack his knight on G4 by moving white pawn to e5} Kd7 11. Qb5+ {Black decides not to take moves Kd7, white Qb5+} Nc6 {Black wanting to save his knight retreats to C6} 12. h3 a6 {My plan at this stage was to advance white pawn to h3. Either forcing the the bishop to retreat or take white NF3. This would allow white to move Queen to F3 for the checkmate. Black did not take the bait moved pawn to a6} 13. Qc4 Kc8 {Retreating- Qc4, Black sensing the danger retreats KC8} 14. hxg4 Nf6 {White captures bishop on G4, Black retreats Nf6. At this stage White, has regained control. Black is quite limited in options. Bishop, rooks and Queen are locked in by pawns and white bishop is strategically positioned} 15. Be6+ Kb8 {White re-positions bishop to e6} 16. O-O Nd7 {White castles. Black retreats Nd7} 17. Nd5 Nde5 {White moves Nd5, Black moves Ne5} 18. Nxe5 Nxe5 {exchange Knights} 19. Qd4 h5 {White queen repositions, black advances pawn to H5} 20. Ba5 b6 {white moves Ba5, black advances pawn to b6} 21. Nxb6 {White captures Nb6} cxb6 22. Bxb6 {black captures white knight, white responds by taking pawn on B6. So yes, I did sacrifice by knight but only for better positioning with the bishops. White's darker squared bishiop is support by white queen. Black Queen needs to move. E8 is the only option} Qe8 23. Qc3 Nc6 {White respositions Queen to C3. Black moves NC6. } 24. Bd5 {*Note the Black Knight is pinned on C6. } Kb7 25. Qb3 {re positioning by both white and black} Rc8 26. Rad1 {black moves rook to C8, White moves rook to D1} e5 27. Rd3 {Black advances pawn to E5. White has other plans and moves rook to D3. } Kb8 28. Ba5+ {black King to B8, White bishop to A5 forcing the check. From here the game is pretty much over. Note the Black Queen was really helpless as most squares were dominated by the two bishops and/or blacks own knight was blocking it from advancing out onto that side of the board. } Ka7 29. Qb6+ Ka8 30. Qxa6+ Kb8 31. Rb3+ Nb4 32. Qa8# {Checkmate}
