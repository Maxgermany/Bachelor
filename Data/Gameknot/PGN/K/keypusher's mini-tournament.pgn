1. e4 e5 2. f4 {King's Gambit.I enjoy playing this opening from both sides.} exf4 {I always feel accepting the gambit is the best way to go.} 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 Bg7 {Staying with the mainline.going with 4...g4 can be okay,but it falls into White's plan of making an irrational game with openings such as the Muzio Gambit.Here Black just fianchettoes soundly.} 5. O-O d6 {Still building a sound position.} 6. h4 {White wants to undermine the g-pawn,which protects the f-pawn he is trying to win back while developing his bishop.} h6 7. d4 Nc6 {The real purpose of this move has yet to be seen.} 8. Nc3 g4 {The idea behind 7...Nc6.The d-pawn will be down a defender.} 9. Nh2 {? Possibly the decisive mistake! 9.Bxf4!? might be the only way to make a game out of it.My opponent made an intriguing comment about this move. "I shouldn't have played 4.Bc4 if I wasn't ready to sac the knight."} Bxd4+ 10. Kh1 Qxh4 {Now Black has a 3 pawn advantage for which White has no compensation.} 11. Bxf7+ {Trying to make some tactics.} Kxf7 12. Rxf4+ Nf6 13. Nd5 {Unfortunately too little too late.} Be5 {White resigns since R anywhere leads to Qxh2#}
