1. c4 {hi this is an interesting game which, though I happened not to win an apparent winning game, gave me the opportunity to win my first tournament.} Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 Bg7 4. d4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 {scheme of the tournament} 9. b4 {my favorite attack... I should think about developing it when I play someone who does not know me, but find out another scheme with people who know me.} Nd7 {preparing the classic f5} 10. a4 {queen-side full horror} f5 {classic counter-attack on the king side.} 11. Ba3 Nf6 12. Nd2 {retiring from the battlefield to compose on the other side. We'll see my knights played a good part here.} g5 13. f3 {trying to blockade the king side.} Bd7 14. c5 {entering.} Ng6 {negate the threat, continuing its own plan. I don't blame ataka: i'd do the same with black.} 15. g3 {computer considers this as an inaccuracy and proposes  15 c6 bxc6 16 dxc6 Bxc6 17 exf which seems better, but was totally out of my plans.} f4 {I think this gave me the opportunity to block this side for a while. I'd pose this as a first mistake from black} 16. g4 Qe7 17. h3 {just in case black is inspired by a sacrifice or a h5 move. I considered I had a little time to continue my own attack. Who said that: "first defense, then attack"?} h5 {bingo!} 18. Nc4 {now, i consider my own attack.} hxg4 19. hxg4 {h-column didn't seem to dangerous for now, since I considered my own attack as faster than the eventual movements rook-king to occupate the free corridor.} Kf7 {But... black considered it... And this is the second mistake here, as the knights are very naughty pieces... computers proposes: 20.	b5	dxc5  21.	d6	cxd6 22.	Nxd6+	Kg8  23.	Nxb7	Rac8 24.	Bc4+	Kh7 25.	Nd5	Nxd5 26.	Qxd5	Kh6 27.	Bxc5, but is black forced to play dxc5?} 20. cxd6 {anyway, my continuation seems very strong.} cxd6 21. b5 {we are now both on d6... Black should play Ne8, thought after that I had some plan to continue my attack.} Rfh8 {?!} 22. Nxd6+ {and check, and a pawn.} Kg8 23. Nxb7 {and a second pawn... but i was now arrived at my own peak... and I did not know it.} Qe8 24. Nc5 {I thought about various other continuations, but did not see any one winning including light black bishop. from now, black will be on the lead, but I still don't know it. computer proposes 24.	Nd6	Qd8 25.	Nf5	Rh7 26.	Rf2	Bf8 27.	d6	Kh8 28.	Rc1	Rc8 29.	Nd5	Rxc1  30.	Bxc1	Nxd5 31.	Qxd5 but once again, is blac forced to play all these moves?} Rh3 {logical, without panicking, ataka leads its own attack.} 25. Qb3 {impressive, no? I thought it was... bishop and queen seem to be able to consider an attack on the king. } Rg3+ 26. Kf2 {king is comfortable to flee, here.} Nh4 27. Ke1 Ng2+ {these 2 pieces seem busy. I have to admit that I considered to late the importance of the e3 square.} 28. Kd2 Rc8 29. Kc1 {dangerous choice, but I was scared of a Ne3-Rg2 continuation. Though the computer estimates this is my first mistake and proposes: 29.	d6+ 	Kh8 30.	Rh1+	Nh4 31.	Kc2	Rg2 32.	Rag1	Rf2 33.	Kc1	Qg6 34.	Nxd7	Nxd7 35.	Re1	Bf6 36.	Rh3 this time, i have to admit that I really did not play well... maybe this was the turn of the game.} Bf8 30. Nxd7 {maybe should have done this for a long time.} Nxd7 {black knigts are also very active tonight.} 31. Kb2 Ne3 32. Rf2 {preferring this to any other solution, i realized my rooks were blocked to defense. But I still got scared of Rg2.} Nb6 {and now the dangerous spot is c4. I started to consider the draw, now, though I was 2 pawns ahead. Computers play Nxg4! I have to admit...} 33. Bxf8 {forced, as a Nc4 position would lead to a double attack on my bishop.} Qxf8 34. Rc1 Nbc4+ 35. Bxc4 Nxc4+ {we can consider the knights have beem much more agressive than the bishop in this game. For both sides.} 36. Ka1 {I should have played Ka2 here...} Rxf3 {gosh, this is a beauty! Congratulations to ataka.} 37. Rxf3 {thought I saw everything that followed, I had to take.} Nd2 38. Qd1 {I considered for a moment Qa2, but I thought it does not lead to nothing and the f-pawn is too dangerous. Actually, it was the best shot} Nxf3 {Here black proposed the draw. I accepted.  39 Qxf4 would lead to Qa3 and a solid draw. }
