[Opening "Robatsch defence (B06), Pseudo-Austrian attack"]

1. e4 {Hi everyone!  No doubt you have heard of the race being on when both sides castle on opposite sides.  This usually happens in the Sicilian Dragon.  This was the Robatsch Defense but the set up was very similar to the Dragon.  Both of us were at each other's throats in this game and it looked as though I was gonna lose, especially when I lost a piece for a pawn and then gave up a rook for Steve's dsb (leaving me a rook for 2 pawns to the bad) to get a perpetual check or, if my opponent slipped up, a snap mate.  So this was the knife-edge.  How did it all end?  Well folks, read on.  I have got the gameknot analysis form of the game here for you to refer to when necessary.    http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13908054&rnd=0.14359211126206422} g6 {1. ... g6 - this move is the Robatsch Defense.  Steve's dsb will go to g7 and may become a monster - for a starters he is bearing down on my rook on a1 when he gets there!} 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. f4 {4. f4 - a kind of Pseudo-Austrian Attack.} a6 5. Nf3 b5 {5. ...... b5 - this is getting a bit like the Sicilian Naijdorf and the Dragon all mixed into one.} 6. Bd3 Nd7 {6. ..... Nd7 - Steve had this post-match comment to make about the gameknot analysis feature here.  "I disagree with the computer that 6...Nd7 was a mistake. If, as the computer suggested, you played 7. a4, I would have moved 7...b4 and focused on a Q-side expansion."} 7. Be3 Bb7 {7. ..... Bb7 - hmm, a double-fianchetto.} 8. e5 c5 9. Be4 Bxe4 10. Nxe4 {10. Nxe4 - glad to get rid of that lsb even at a cost of Fou Leblanc.} Nh6 11. Qe2 cxd4 12. Bxd4 {12. Bxd4 - pawn trade.} Nf5 13. O-O-O Nxd4 14. Rxd4 {14. Rxd4 - Fou Lenoir is traded for black's king knight.  I will miss him, especially as Steve has that very strong bishop on g7 raking down on my castled position, albeit indirectly.} O-O 15. Rhd1 Qa5 16. Kb1 {16. Kb1 - necessary, to protect the pawn on a2.} Nb6 17. Ng3 Nc4 18. Qe1 {18. Qe1 - I offer a trade of queens but Steve is not interested.} Qc7 19. Re4 {19. Re4 - time to break the pin on the e5 pawn.} f5 20. exf6 e.p. Bxf6 21. c3 {21. c3 - necessary to block the diagonal off from that nasty black dsb!} a5 22. Nd4 {22. Nd4 - threatening a fork on e6.} Rfb8 23. f5 {23. f5 - I now try and bust open the BK's position but alas, this proves to be premature according to Gameknot Analysis which suggested 23. Ne6.  Please refer to the link for further detail.} b4 24. Re2 {24. Re2 - my rook comes back to defend the pawn on b2.} bxc3 25. Qxc3 {25. Qxc3 - forced as my b2 pawn is pinned.} d5 26. fxg6 hxg6 {26. ..... hxg6 - I have weakened Steve's position as planned but will Steve get in first?} 27. Qd3 {27. Qd3?! - this move will result in the loss of a piece but will my attack be sufficient compo?} Bxd4 28. Qxg6+ {28. Qxg6+ - if I played Qxd4?? here then I would have to give up the exchange to save Glenda after 28..... Na3+ 29. Ka1 Nc2+.  With the black heavies bearing down upon Henry my outlook will be very bleak indeed.  Steve told me that Qxd4 would have made his life much easier - I am glad I played Qxg6+ and made Steve run the gauntlet from Glenda then.} Bg7 29. Qe6+ Kf8 30. Rf1+ {30. Rf1+ - Glenda badly needs some assistance.  If 30. .... Ke8 then Qf7+ leads to a perpetual with Glenda oscillating from g8-e6 to check the BK.  Steve therefore decided to interpose his bishop.} Bf6 31. Rxf6+ {31. Rxf6+ - Here I sacrificed my rook for two pawns.  I was on the high wire without a safety net.  The last time I sacrificed any material was in a game against The Master Mater of all people annotated as Don't Play for Cheapos - needless to say I lost.  Steve told me that he did not expect this move at all.  This move completely opens up the BK to Glenda and my other rook and possibly my knight on g3 so I thought that I might at least save the game and if Steve erred, even win it!} exf6 32. Qxf6+ Kg8 {32. ..... Kg8 - Steve told me in the chat that he thought he had made a blunder.  I did not comment at this stage but I thought that Steve's next move 33. ..... Qg7 was an innacuracy and that 33. ...... Kh8 was better because if I checked him on the h column then the Wicked Witch of the West would give Henry a cross-check on h7.  I anticipated that before I played 32. Qg5+ because my next move would have been to have put Henry on a1 away from any checks from Steve's pieces and hopefully be able to resume checking the BK.} 33. Qg5+ Qg7 34. Qxd5+ {34. Qxd5+ - for a start it allows me to claw back another pawn for the missing rook.  3 pawns for the rook is nowhere near enough though and I still have some work to do to save this game here.} Qf7 35. Qg5+ Kh8 {35. ...... Kh8 - now he plays Kh8 but I can now play my rook to e7 because the Wicked Witch is off the c or d column.  If I had played this move on move 33 then Re7 would not have worked because of 34. Na3+ followed by Ka1 followed by Qc1#.  No back row mate is possible here because my knight on g3 controls the f1 square.  Now the BQ is pinned to a mate on g7.} 36. Re7 Na3+ 37. Ka1 {37. Ka1 - this move is best because I analysed a forced mate for Steve should Henry have gone to c1 starting with 38. Rc8+.  Steve played Nc2+ and offered me a draw (now, ironically, it was Steve needing a perpetual to save HIS game) which I accepted.  Pheeeeeeeew!} Nc2+ {}
