1. e4 {1st gameknot game with my uncle.} c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 {A closed sicilian} 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 {Oups, an open sicilian -> back to the good old dragon sicilian.} cxd4 5. Nxd4 Bg7 {Obviously not Nxd4 Qxd4 and the attack on h8 rook is annoying.} 6. Be3 {Reinforce the center} d6 {One more control on e5 before Nf6. Nf6 is better, and main line according to GK database. I'm not a sicilian player, if you are familiar with this opening, please add comment.} 7. Qd2 Bd7 8. O-O-O a6 9. Bc4 Nf6 10. f3 O-O {White played the opening precisely and as a better developement, more space and a strong center. Black already have an open column to attack the king, + some tempo as Bc4 and Nc3 will have to move in case of b7-b5-b4. I prefer white anyway. Plan for white : pawn storm on the king and attack !!! Plan for black : pawn storm on the king and attack !!!} 11. g4 b5 12. g5 {!? Bb3 seems better, white probably wants an open file.} bxc4 {A pawn is a pawn ! I thought : if I cannot do the classical exchange sacrifice on c3, never mind, I'll pressure on b2 instead.} 13. gxf6 Bxf6 14. Qe2 {I was expecting 14.h4 h5 15.f4 16.f5, or 14.Nxc6 BxN 15.Bh6 Re8 16.h4 17.h5, more agressive.} Na5 {Played in the ugliest style :(p} 15. Bh6 Re8 16. Be3 {I was expecting h4 or f4. With opposite castle, one should attack the king as fast as possible ! White last 3 moves wasted some time. Ok, my pieces don't look clever either.} Rb8 17. Kb1 Rb7 {17. ...Qb6, straight to the point (b2) was better !} 18. Ka1 Qb6 19. Rdb1 {Ayo ! How can you forget your good old knight like that ? If 19.Nb3 Qb4 20.Nc5 Qb5 21.Nxf6+ exN and the knight is dead. But 19.Ndb5 ! Qc6 20.Nd4 and draw offer.} Bxd4 20. Bxd4 Qxd4 21. Rhd1 Qe5 {With a knight up, it is an easy win :D If I do not blunder. Ayo ! How can I forget my good old knight like that ? Qg7 or Qf6, obviously} 22. Rd5 Qe6 23. Rxa5 {My poor old brave knight...} Ra8 24. h4 h5 25. Qg2 {Both players pieces are a bit messy, aren't they ?} Bc6 26. Rxh5 {! Ayo, my good old pawn !} Rab8 27. Ra5 Qf6 {Threaten the knight, and behind it b2 pawn and king} 28. Ra3 Qxh4 29. Qf1 {Rh1 Qf6 Qh2 would have been troublesome.} Qh2 30. Qe2 Qxe2 {I exchanged because Queen is white most active piece. In the coming endgame, white kingis out of play, and the rooks are tight to defense.} 31. Nxe2 Rb7b6 {A pawn is a pawn. Protect it.} 32. Nd4 Bd7 33. Rc3 e5 {Pushed to gain control of e6 for the bishop.} 34. Ne2 Be6 35. a4 {White position is quite difficult to play. May be try b3 to free b1 rook, but where can it go ?} Rb6b4 36. Ra3 d5 {To start the kingside pawn majority advance, and to prepare an attack on the remaining pawn in case of exchange. I should play it before Nc3.} 37. exd5 Bxd5 38. f4 {? facilitate black task of creating passed pawns.} exf4 39. Nc3 {I don't understand why white didn't take back the pawn, but thanks} Bc6 40. Nd1 Rxa4 41. Rxa4 Bxa4 42. c3 Rb5 {With the threat Bc2} 43. Rc1 Ra5 44. Nf2 {This time, white choose not to offer the knight but the king, strange echo to move 19 where the king was saved by the knight.} Bc2# {Thanks for looking, comments are welcome.}
