1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g6 {An unusual defence to the King's Gambit, and since it slows Black's development while doing nothing to make White work for the f4 pawn, I doubt it's especially sound. In this opening White threatens to hammer away at the f-file and Black has to play actively to prevent White walking all over him.} 4. Bc4 {Why not, thought I? It's less clear-cut after 3. ... g5 as after 4. ... g4 White either has to sacrifice a piece (5. 0-0, the Muzio Gambit) or play 5. Ne5, the Salvio Gambit, which doesn't quite work against good defence. In the present line, though, the lure of preventing ...d5 while threatening f7 seemed too good to turn down.} Nh6 {This defends f7 after a fashion, but the Knight itself is exposed on this square and also lacks mobility. But 4. ...Bh6 to defend the f4 pawn is horrible after 5. Ne5.} 5. d4 Bg7 {Black's reluctance to make me work for the f4 pawn is hard to understand.} 6. Bxf4 O-O 7. Qd2 {With such a lovely development I feel I can try to prove that Black's routine castling was unsound. Analysing later, I found that 7. Qc1 might have been even stronger, as in some lines Black's Knight goes to f6 by way of g4, and then if I pin it with Bg5 Black can play ...Nxe4 because White's Queen is attacked as well as Black's.} d6 {? Black doesn't seem to have noticed that his Knight is attacked twice and defended only once.} 8. Bxh6 Qf6 {After this I spent a lot of time thinking about the logical and strong 9. 0-0, and it was only after fretting over ...Be6 that I realized Black's Queen would be short of squares if he played this... and then that she is short of squares now! The ensuing little pleasantry wouldn't be possible if I'd played the stronger 7. Qc1, when I would have just had to make do with a comfortable middle-game a piece up.} 9. Bg5 Qxf3 {9. ...Bh6 saves the Queen, but after 10. Bxh6 Black still has to move the Queen from her unsafe square, when I can play 11. Bxf8 and eliminate Black's last K-side piece for the loss of only my Bishop, and I still have an attacking development as well as being a Rook and Knight to the good.} 10. gxf3 {At this point my opponent thought better of playing on a whole Queen in arrears. :)}
