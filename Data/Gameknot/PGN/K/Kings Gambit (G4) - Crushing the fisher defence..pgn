1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d6 {Fisher defense. I think alot of people play this move because it is the 'Fisher' move. Black seems to struggle alot in a lot of lines so has to tread very carefully.} 4. d4 g5 5. h4 g4 6. Ng1 {As I said earlier could take Ng5 but its very unsound.   This is the book position which is very strange considering after 6 moves we have a load of passed pawns and no minor or major pieces developed.} Nf6 {Black attacks e4. Prob hoping to buy time and defend the f pawn on h5.} 7. Bxf4 {Takes the pawn exchange although could be viewed as a mistake since whites pawn was central and black would have had to waste valuable time & effort defending f pawn. } Nxe4 {No choice. } 8. Bd3 {Better than Nc3} Qe7 9. Ne2 {Stopping revealed check & losing Queen.} Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. Bxe4 {White has a lead in development with the open file.} Qxe4 12. Nbc3 Qc6 13. Qd2 d5 {To stop Bh6} 14. Ng3 Qf6 {Black is restricted here. Unable to develop his pieces he looks to pick up a pawn to make himself feel better!} 15. Be5 Qxh4 {Gets his free pawn!} 16. Bxg7 {Exposes King. Blacks only developed piece here is his Queen.} Kxg7 17. Nxd5 f5 {Knight on g3 is safe as would lead to mate in 3 if Queen takes.} 18. Qf4 Nc6 19. Nxc7 Rb8 20. Rae1 {White is loaded up. Had better development and control of the open and semi open file. Smart play should lead to a victory from here.} Kg8 21. d5 Ne7 22. Nh5 {! Black has to take exchange. If he doesnt 23.Qh3 which at best would result in lost Queen.} Qxh5 23. Rxe7 b5 {Making room to get rook into help out the defense.} 24. Rfe1 {WHites rooks are now conected on an open file. Black is in serious danger.} Rb6 25. d6 {Blocks the rooks involvement and the prospect of promotion could become a real thorn in blacks side. } Qh4 26. g3 Qf6 {A nice little finishing combo for yall.} 27. Ne8 Qxb2 28. Qg5+ Kh8 29. Rxh7+ {Rook sac   :) } Kxh7 30. Re7+ Kh8 31. Qh5+ Kg8 32. Qh7# {Thats all folks!}
