[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Keres defence"]

1. d4 {Before this game, I was 2-2 vs. Will.  I rely heavily on attacking and position play; Will seems to play from position and combinations.  I wanted to play a Queen-side game because the wider King-side often leads me into sloppy attacks.} e6 2. c4 {I prefer a gambit, accepted or refused, to the other Queen's pawn openings.} b6 {Will mentioned that he dislikes the gambit, but this defense was new to me.} 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. e4 {Up to this point, I was continuing standard lines, not seeing a good alternative.  e4 here was played mainly from curiosity.} Bb4 5. Bd3 Qf6 6. Nf3 {This position can be found here: http://gameknot.com/chess-games.pl?n=238591&bd=8274923&h=0&fb=0&pm=0&m=d2d4e7e6c2c4b7b6b1c3c8b7e2e4f8b4f1d3d8f6g1f3.  I'm not sure of the exact continuation from here, but White's next three moves are 7. O-O, 8. Ne2, 9. Qa4 eventually winning the bishop.  I established a strong position, and then lost the game later by moving e5, unblocking the bishop.  Game was eventually called a draw about seven moves later after Will failed to find the mate.  He had mate in 2 plus some garbage stall moves by White.}
