[Opening "Philidor (C41), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {The Philidor. An opening I don't often play.} Bg4 {Out of the book, now.} 4. O-O {Castling on move four.} Bh5 {With this move, my opponent condemns his LSB to either sacrifice, or else a boring life on the e8-h5 diagonal. } 5. Nc3 {With plans to go to e2.} c6 {? Weak move, I think. He needs to develop. White's presence is felt.} 6. Ne2 Nf6 7. Ng3 {I am aware of the saying, "Don't move the same piece twice in the opening," but my development advantage makes me somewhat exempt from this.} Bg6 {And the Bishop is basically worthless, except for the added pressure to e4.} 8. d4 {Busting open the center.} exd4 9. Qxd4 {Bringing a big piece into the fray.} Be7 10. Bg5 Nbd7 11. e5 {Further simplifying the position.} dxe5 12. Nxe5 Nxe5 13. Qxe5 O-O 14. Rad1 Qe8 15. Bd3 {A bad trade, but I needed to double my Rooks on the d-file.} Bxd3 16. Rxd3 Rd8 17. Rfd1 Rd5 18. Rd3xd5 cxd5 19. Re1 {Doubling on the e-file.} Bd8 20. Bxf6 Qxe5 21. Bxe5 {Only move.} Re8 22. Nf5 Bf6 23. Nd6 {Forcing the trade, and keeping material even down the road.} Rxe5 24. Rxe5 Bxe5 25. Nxb7 Bxb2 {Now you see the importance of moving the Knight on move 23.} 26. Kf1 f5 27. Ke2 {Getting my King into the mix.} Kf7 28. Nd6+ Ke6 29. Ne8 a5 30. Nc7+ Ke5 31. Kd3 {Blocking the Black King.} f4 32. f3 d4 {?? Totally kills Black's DSB.} 33. Ne8 g5 34. Ng7 a4 {Waiting move. } 35. Ne8 h5 36. Ng7 g4 37. Nxh5 gxf3 38. gxf3 {A passed h-pawn.} Kf5 39. h4 Kg6 40. Nxf4+ Kf5 41. Nh3 Kg6 42. f4 Kh5 {He forfeits his life, here.} 43. f5 Kxh4 44. f6 Kxh3 45. f7 Ba3 {I thought he blocked me, for a moment here. } 46. Kxd4 Kg4 47. c4 Kf5 48. c5 {Not anymore. I Queen, one way or another.} Ke6 49. f8=Q {He resigns. There was a good chance for Black to win in the middlegame, although White's lead in development and Kingside space would have placed him at an advantage. Black could have reduced it to a King/pawn vs. King endgame, but he gave up the ghost and White took the victory. Thank you, kakazai, for this great game.
