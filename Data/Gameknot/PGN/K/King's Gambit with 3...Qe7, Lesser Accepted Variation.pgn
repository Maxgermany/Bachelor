1. e4 e5 2. f4 {Over the summer I bought "The King's Gambit as White" by Bob Raingruber and Lou Maser. As a result I've started to play a few correspondence games with the King's Gambit as white using the book as my reference. } exf4 3. Nf3 {King's Knight Gambit} Qe7 {3... Qe7 is a lesser accepted variation. The queen move to e7 is also seen in the Keene variation. According to my book, "As in the Keene variation, here too Black's concept appears non-trivial." } 4. Nc3 {Black intends immediate pressure on e4. From the options of 4. e5 d6; 4. Qe2 b6 (with the idea of Ba6); 4. d3 d5; 4. d4 Qe4; 4. Nc3, 4. Nc3 is the clear favorite. } f6 {?  Examined in my book are 4... Nf6 5. e5 d6 6. d4 de5 7. de5 Ng4 8. Bf4 Ndb7 9. Qe2 (with the idea of Qe2) and White has far superior development.  4... d5 5. e5 c6 leads towards a line that is reminiscent of the Fisher Variation.   Here f6 could look to a possible g5 push, but presents Black's knight with only the weak h6 square and g5 gains little. } 5. d3 {instead of d4 because now the e4 pawn is defended and the knight can move to d5. } c6 {Black has already given White enough compensation for the pawn. 5... d6 6. Bxf4 Nc6 7. Qd2 (with the idea of O-O-O)  =} 6. Bxf4 {Clearly. } Qb4 {Attacking the vulnerable queen-side, but Black lags in development. the pawns on c6 and f6 deprive the Knight's of their squares whereas the awkward queen placement and pawn on d7 lock in the bishops. } 7. Rb1 {Also available is Qc1. } Qa5 8. a4 {A weaker move, Be2 preparing for castling is better, as is Nd2 allowing the queen to come to f3 with threats on the weak Black king. } Na6 {Black wants to develop and is eying the weakened b4 square. } 9. Be2 Bb4 10. O-O {Seems to lose a pawn, but Black's bigger problem is development, trading the bishop trades away his only good piece. } Bxc3 11. bxc3 Qxc3 12. Qd2 {To averse to trading another good black piece for a weak white one.} Qc5+ 13. d4 {Gaining more time by pushing around the Queen, Black's lagging development will start to toll soon. } Qe7 {A weak square, but the best one. } 14. e5 {Looking to open the file, perhaps slightly better is 14. Rfe1, but as White starts to break open Black's fragile position many moves fit the bill. } Nc7 {?? A blunder allowing 15. exf6 Nxf6 16. Bxc7 ...} 15. exf6 gxf6 {This move gives Black even more trouble, the Queen can now check on h5 without being blocked} 16. Bxc7 d6 17. Qa5 {! Defending the bishop and eying h5. 17.... b6 fails to 18. Bxb6 The weaknesses in Black's open and undeveloped position are starting to tell, 17...Kf8 is probably advisable, 18. Rbe1 bg4 19. Bd3 Qd7  -} Qd7 {Giving White time to set up a fierce attack. } 18. Rbe1 {Not the other rook which may be needed on the f-file later. } Ne7 {Desperately trying to provide some protection while developing a piece.} 19. Qh5+ {Just what White was looking for, Black's really in trouble now; Crafty gives white  15.00 Depth 12 Nodes 122M after 19... Ng6 20. Bc4  Qe6} Ng6 20. Bc4+ Kf8 {?? Game losing move which opens Black up to mate in six. 20... Qe6 21. Bxe6 Bxe6 22. Ng5 Kd7 23. Nxe6 d5 24. Rxf6 Rae8 25. Rf7  Kc8 26. Rxh7 Rxh7 27. Qxh7 Score 15.44 Depth 13 Nodes 132M  1-0.} 21. Qh6+ Qg7 22. Bxd6+ {Black resigns in light of a many lines to mate after Ne7 then either Rxe7 or Bxe7. The position to start the mate in six is puzzle 8435.  }
