1. e4 {So he starts with the usual} c5 {and I play the Sicilian} 2. Nf3 {Mark usually plays the open variation against it.} d6 {I normally play Nc6, but I had several games with Mark a week ago, so I decided to play something different from what I was playing last week.} 3. d4 {So he continues} cxd4 {I take} 4. Nxd4 {He takes back} Nf6 {I hit the e pawn} 5. Nc3 {He defends} Nbd7 {So this is the move that I used to play at university.} 6. Bg5 {He continues with what he normally plays in the main line. However now of course, there is no threat to double my f pawns, so it is probably not the best move.} Qa5 {I am now threatening Nxe4 and Qxg5, but this is easily met, so perhaps it is not the best move. I see on the opening databases, there is no record of 6....Qa5 being played before.} 7. Qd2 {Preparing 0-0-0} a6 {So I prepare queen side advances. } 8. O-O-O {He castles} b5 {I start my queen side advances, threatening b4 followed by Nxe4} 9. f3 {Which is easily met} b4 {I attack} 10. Nb1 {He retreats. If now Qxa2 11. Qxb5 and my queen is very much out of play. He can play Bc4 forcing Qa1 and even more out of the game. I have to be careful now about move like Nc6 and/or a6 winning my pawn on b4} e6 {So I prepare d4, opening up the a3-f8 diagonal, so my pawn is supported by my Bf8} 11. Bc4 {He develops} Bb7 {And so do I. I want to be able to play d5 and recapture with a piece on d5. If I take back with the e pawn, the e file is open and Rh1-e1 check is very strong. Bb7 also prevents him from playing Nc6} 12. a3 {Threatening my pawn on b4} d5 {So I open up the diagonal} 13. exd5 {He takes} Nxd5 {I take back} 14. Rhe1 {The logical place to put his rook} Nd7b6 {I hit his bishop, re-inforcing my other knight on d5} 15. Bb3 {and the bishop drops back} Rc8 {This is the logical square for the rook. OK, stop, analyse this position. What would you play now as white?} 16. Nxe6 {Yes, here is comes...} fxe6 {So I take} 17. Rxe6+ {He takes back. Now Ne7 18. Qd7+ wins for white, as does Be7 18. Bxe7 Nxe7 19. Qd7+. 17.....Kd7 looks dreadful for instance Kd7 18. Rxb6 Qxb6 19. Bxd5  and black is falling apart. This leaves just one move.    } Kf7 {I was now expecting 18. Rxb6 Qxb6 19. Bxd5+ Bxd5 20. Qxd5+ Qe6 21. Qd7+ with a fairly level position, with white having two extra pawns, for the exchange. } 18. Re5 {But he plays this} Bd6 {I thought I was Ok now, my rooks are connected. I was expecting 19. Rxd5 Nxd5 20. Bxd5+ Bxd5 21. Qxd5+ Qxd5 22. Rxd5 and again white has two pawns for the exchanges, and it is a level endgame. I may even have a slight edge, and my king, exposed a few moves ago, is now wonderfully centralised for the ending. However he plays.... } 19. Qf4+ {Now if Kg6 20. Qf5+ Kh5 21. Bf4+ Kh4 22. Qg4# but I have another option } Kg8 {Luckily there was another square for my king.} 20. Qf5 {Queen advances. My search engine says Qg4 also wins for white.} Bxe5 {I was actually quite confident here! I missed his winning plan.} 21. Qe6+ {Queen checks} Kf8 {Forced! Also, stop and work out white's next move.} 22. Be7+ {Of course, if I take the bishop, Nxe7, he has Qf7 mate.} Ke8 {So I have this alternative. There is actually a mate in two now. 23. Bc5+ Kd8 24. Qe7# , but he picks up my queen instead. } 23. Bxb4+ {It is hopeless for black now} Kd8 {As good as anything. He now has a mate in one, Qe7} 24. Bxa5 {But he takes the queen instead. It is hopeless for black now. As he was down into his last 5 minutes, I played on to mate, but I don't think any further comments are necessary} Bf4+ 25. Nd2 Nc7 26. Bxb6 Re8 27. Qc4 g5 28. Kb1 Re7 29. Qg8+ Kd7 30. Ne4+ Nd5 31. Ba4+ Bc6 32. Qxd5+ Ke8 33. Qg8# {Many thanks for reading this, I hope you enjoyed it, please leave some comments and rate it with the star system.}
