[Opening "Scotch gambit (C44), Anderssen (Paulsen, Suhle) counter-attack"]

1. e4 {As normal as ever.} e5 {I reply normally - I don't play any openings - my favourite is 1. d5 for white - I rely on tactics to win the game.} 2. Nf3 {Attacking the e5 pawn.} Nc6 {Subsequently defending.} 3. d4 {This; I believe, is the scotch. I have no further replies than exd4.} exd4 {Now, I expected for my opponent to take the pawn, however, he did not.} 4. Bc4 {Probably attacking f7; I do not see this move as a beginner's move; rather, a sensible one.} Bc5 {I protect my d4 pawn and develop my bishop.} 5. c3 {c3. I am somewhat unfamiliar to the Scotch, so I took innocently ...} dxc3 {... not knowing that I was to fall for a beginner's (?) trap.} 6. Bxf7+ {Not taking the bishop would be awkward, but taking the bishop isn't much better.} Kxf7 {Leaving d5 a forking square.} 7. Qd5+ {This forks the unprotected bishop on c5.} Ke8 {Hoisting my king back to safety.} 8. Qxc5 {The bishop goes.} cxb2 {I take the pawn before the pawn takes me.} 9. Bxb2 {The bishop takes its long laser aim at g7. Is this position in any way better for white - this disables my ability to castle, but is this strictly better for white? Black is still a pawn up. Take a moment to look at this position.} d6 {Chasing away the queen and opening the lines for my bishop - note that Bxg7 is irrelevant as the queen is attacked.} 10. Qd5 {The threat on g7 is renewed. Note that after 10. Qh5+?! g6 the queen is attacked, thus the rook on h8 is safe.} Nf6 {Attacking the queen and preventing 11. Bxg7.} 11. Qb3 {Probably not the best square for the queen. A really passive square - moreover.} Nxe4 {What with 11... Nxe4 12. Bxg7 Rg8 pins the bishop to the g2 pawn. I have used the term 'pin' here, because after any move by the bishop, the pawn is lost, thus the queen must move to defend it.} 12. Qe3 {This annoying pin pins the knight to the king. The knight needs to be defended.} Bf5 {Is this the best move - this develops the LSB; however, Nh4! would be quite a killing move, with the only response to be 13. ... b6, losing the rook, were it not for Qxh4 - but if the knight was defended...} 13. Nc3 {Adding the pressure and developing a piece.} Qe7 {Is this a good move? Query to 14. Nd5 but then the Queen could just move. } 14. Nd5 {And thus Nd5 is played - prior to the fact the queen must not leave the c7 pawn unprotected otherwise Nxc7 would fork the king and rook.} Qf7 {This attacks the unprotected knight on d5.} 15. Rd1 {Defending the knight and centralising the rook.} Kd7 {Relieving the pin and connecting the rooks. d7 is a safe square for the king, as the only attack is from the c8 - h3 diagonal, defended by the f5 bishop. However, this inserts a new worry - Ne5+, were it not for Nxe5 or dxe5 - but if dxe5 then Nb5++ would be disastrous. I have listed the possibility below.   16. Ne5+ dxe5 17. Nb6++ Ke7 18. Nxa8 Rxa8 or 16. Ne5+ dxe5 17. Nf6++ Kd7 18. Nxe4 Bxe4. 19. Qxe4+ regaining material with an overall better position. However, white's dreams are crushed due to the knight on c6, but if it moves ...} 16. Qb3 {This looks dangerous. What with 17. Nc6+ Ke8 18. Nxa8 wins a whole rook, or Ke7 wins the exchange. The queen is not won; the king defends the queen, but the exchange is won.} Rhf8 {Dangerous - this looks risky; note any moves that win for white?} 17. h3 {A quiet passive move, possibly planning  g4 - next move, or just creating a flight square for the king after O-O.} Rae8 {Nasty discovered check 18. ... Nc5+!! coming up next move.} 18. Ne3 {A rather weird way of concluding the discovered check. The queens can be swapped of, after which an isolated pawn on b3 is produced. The bishop is not won after Nxf5 - Ng3+ concludes matters following Rxf5.} Qxb3 {Queen swap.} 19. axb3 {The pawn on b3 is weak, and after maybe the three pawns on the a, b and c files will triumph.} g5 {Possibly, I was planning g4 next, destructing the position - I cannot remember.} 20. g4 {g4 as planned - but now the king cannot castle - here comes the crusher ...} Bxg4 {Bxg4 - looks like equality as after 21. hxg4 Rxf3 22. Rxh7+ white even gains a tempo, but that is not the case - Observe.} 21. hxg4 {Hxg4 as follows.} Rxf3 {RXN as follows - and the f2 pawn is attacked!} 22. Rxh7+ {Rxa7 as follows. } Kc8 {Sheltering beneath the wall of pawns and relieving the pin on the d6 pawn.} 23. Rg7 {This is the mistake - to big to be made. The g5 pawn is defended by the knight on e4, but the f2 pawn is attacked- that is the bigger threat.} Nxf2 {Nxf2! Crushing. White cannot cope with both Nxd1 and R8xe3/R3xe3. He will lose either the knight, or the rook, or both ...} 24. Ke2 {Oh dear. This move is wrong because ...} Nxd1 {I actually made a mistake here - The best move was 24. ... Rxe3+ 25. Kd2 (25. Ke1 Nxd1+ 26. Kg2 and the bishop is free) but Nxd1 isn't that bad. If 25. Kxd1 then 25 ... Nxe3 wins a whole rook, whilst after Kxf3 then 25. ... Rxe3+ and Nxb2 wins. The latter was played.} 25. Kxf3 {The most appetising may not be the best.} Rxe3+ {A zwichenszug and the bishop is still hanging. The king cannot move to f2 or f4 which are the only square that can attack the rook, f2 covered by the knight and the f4 square covered by the pawn. } 26. Kg2 {The only square.} Nxb2 {The bishop disappears.} 27. Rg8+ {In an attempt to slow down my king.} Kd7 28. Rg7+ {Another check. } Ne7 {To blockade more checks - of course, we could have Ke6 but then it comes Rg6+ and Kd8 fails to Rg8+.} 29. Rxg5 {The rook snatches the pawn. No worry about the pawn, but the black pieces are quite inactive. How to combine them?} Ke6 {The g6 square is covered - I get my king into the game.} 30. Kf2 {Trying to attack my rook: of course, with 30 ... Nd1+ checks and defends the rook, but I prefer to move the rook.} Re5 {When in the lead, swap pieces and not pawns, and vice versa.} 31. Rg7 {And when losing, swap pawns but not pieces - however, I think there is no hope for white.} Kd5 {Trying to get my king into the game - my knight is defended due to the rook on e5.} 32. Rh7 {Trying to create a safe path for his pawn to promote - preferably 33. Rh3 34. Rg3} Nd3+ {I give my opponent no time for this nonsense.} 33. Kf3 {Protecting the pawn.} Re4 {Preparing for 34. ... Ne5+! winning the pawn.} 34. g5 {Pushing the pawn and escaping from the Ne5+ fork.} Ne5+ {I do this anyway.} 35. Kg3 {Stilling trying for the middle.} Nf5+ {Note that 35. ... Rg5+ would have been possible, winning the pawn, but this just looks better and more co-ordinated.} 36. Kg2 {We still have 36. ... Rg4+.} Rg4+ {Note here that my objective was not to win the pawn, but the game. However, this stops the pawn from leading.} 37. Kf2 {Centralising the king.} c5 {Trying to get a pawn of my own.} 38. Rxb7 {Trying to counter-attack and win its own pawns.} a5 {Rescuing the a-pawn and preparing to play 39. ... a5 where white is forced to play 40. bxa5 leaving a suitable passed c-pawn.} 39. Rb5 {Of course, now my c-pawn is trapped, by I have my own plans.} Rb4 {39. ... Rb4! sheltered and protected by two pawns. What could be better?} 40. Rxa5 Rxb3 {Nothing has changed, except that white is uncoordinated. } 41. Ra1 {Perhaps planning to play Rg1 next move where the pawn will triumph.} Rf3+ {A stream of checks follow.} 42. Ke2 {Still trying to centralise the king. } Nd4+ {Another check.} 43. Kd2 Nc4+ {A losing position for white - all three possibilities fail, like so:  44. Kc1 Rf1+ wins the rook. 44. Kd1 Rf1+ wins the rook. 44. Ke1 Nc2+ wins the rook.} 44. Kd1 {But this one fails directly due to: (as well as Kc1)} Rf1# {44. ... Rf1# Thank you for watching.
