1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. f4 {6.f4 !? , Interesting the Levenfish attack on the Dragon Sicilian ,its not typical variation that white and black are attacking each other coast to coast witch goes on the most cases in the Dragon Sicilian , when white attacks in the king side while black attacks the center if he can or the queen side , the idea of this move 6.f4 is to advance e5 get space in the center and push blacks pieces to passive position and exchange the the blacks d pawn and make him weak and basicly its som how make the black to get out of his game plan , because blacks DSB develops to e7 and not the long diagonal h8-a1 becaus of the weaknes on d6 and so long , however white doesnt have abig advantange and with good game by black evatuly he equals the position very fast .} Bg7 {bad move ,the correct move is 6...Nc6 to defend the e5 square , white replies with 7.Nxc6 -bxc6.8.e5-Nd7.9.exd- exd .10.Bc4-Be7.11.Be3-0-0.12.Qf3-Qc7 and black is fine } 7. e5 dxe5 8. fxe5 Ng4 {blunder , black is going to lose his knight , better was 8...Ng8 .9.Bb5+Bd7.10.e6-Bxb5.11.exf+Kxf7.12.Nc3xb5 with better position . } 9. Bb5+ {the threat now is Qxg4 ! , if black moves 9...Bd7 than .10.Qxg4 and the bishop can not capture the queen because of the pin by Bb5 , if 9...Nd7 than .10.Qxg4 and if 9...Nc6 .10.Nxc6 and black cant re capture on c6 because the attack on the rook on a8 with check , for example : 10...bxc6.11.Bxc6+Bd7.12.Bxa8. unfortunately for black in his next move he choose the worst of the worst move in his bad position .} Kf8 {A terrible blunder !! although black managed to save his knight on g4 instead he loses his queen and resigned } 10. Ne6+ {Black resigned . }
