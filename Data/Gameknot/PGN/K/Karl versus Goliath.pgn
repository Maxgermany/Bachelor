1. d4 {[All comments welcomed!]  Queens Gambit, only white opening I have played so far.  Opponent rated 2147, I am probably above 1500 now, so I know from the beginning I am going to be terminated...let's see how long I last.} d5 2. c4 c6 {Gambit not accepted, I guess.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 {Standard developement for king side attack.} Bf5 5. h4 {This h4 pawn move has worked well for me in the past, setting up the king side attack after my delayed queen side castle. [PaulMorphy91]  Thanks, I like that counter, and have run into this position many times not knowing how to respond to that control over the diagonal by black.} e6 6. Bg5 {Standard attack on queen to prevent his knight to e4, his prepared e4 triple square attack.} Be7 7. e3 {Queens Gambit, not accepted, so freeing the white square Bishop for d3} O-O {His normal, early, and predictable castle is what I need, and he does it...thanks bro!} 8. cxd5 {Allowing me to eventually Bishop to d3} Nxd5 {He wants to elliminate my king side attacking pieces} 9. Bxe7 {Need to maintain h4 pon as attack support} Qxe7 {I thought this queen takes knight to be peculiar, Knight takes prevents my pawn fork.} 10. e4 {The fork.} Nxc3 11. bxc3 Bxe4 12. Ng5 {For whatever reason he paused a long time after I made this basic knight move, still working my position for my king side attack.[To all Commentors]  First, thanks!  Now what I am not seeing is after move 15 O-O-O, is not my positioning as a result of this not enough to be winnable on the king side by a equal player?} Bg6 13. Bd3 {Finally I get to do the d3!} Bxd3 14. Qxd3 {Threatening mate, baby!  Ok, no chance of it, but at least I got my pieces into this position against a superior opponent.} g6 {Still manuevering to start my attack but first...} 15. O-O-O {Queen side castle to support my king side attack.  A real player could probally do well from here as white, however it is me playing so...[[ Is this position not winnable for white?]]} Nd7 {He has development needs.} 16. f4 Qf6 17. Rdf1 {g3 probably the move to make here [pm91] I see what you are saying with h5. What about  ...h5 pg4,h5xg4  ph5, g6xh5 rxh5,   white seems good there, eh?} Nb6 18. h5 {The whole reason for h4.} Nd5 19. hxg6 {pxp rather than g2-g3, best idea?  No idea. Going for kn-h7 Queen rook fork. } fxg6 20. Nxh7 {He paused here also.  He has three attacking f4 with a check vs one in defense, I plan here to capture the knight with f1 if he takes f4} Qf5 {I have no reason to capture the rook, and I know qxq will shorten my game.} 21. Qg3 {Preparing for h file attack} Rf7 22. Qh4 {Hoping against hope for eventual q-h8  [Reply to binblaster comment] I see what you are saying, ng5 followed by h2 superior, I was so surprised to make it this far, I missed this move and the easy defense of h8 he had.  Thanks for the comment![pm91]  I never did concieve of g4 as a possible, I will take into account piece pon support rather than just other pons, thanks!} Nxc3 {Sing it:  "Where have all my defensive pawns gone....long time passing." Of course his q threatens b1, checking in the open, which would surely be a swift demise for me.  Still hoping for Q-h8.} 23. Nf6+ {Check, baby! Plus the threat at h8!} Qxf6 {It took him 1 milisecond to destroy all my plans.  For that you must PAY!} 24. Qxf6 {Try to mate me quickly with only a knight!} Rxf6 25. g3 {MY f4 pawn, and you cannot have it.  Way too late with g3, but no time like the present! [@Dragoncheckmate] Yea e2 is brutal, I will have to spend more time visualizing the multiple knight moves. Thanks!} Kg7 26. Rh3 Rh8 {Now he decides to show me what's what about who can win with less pieces.} 27. Rxh8 {Can't checkmate me if you have only one piece near my king} Kxh8 28. Rh1+ {Another check for me!  I have (short lived) bragging rights that I checked a chess master twice in one game. [@vladyslav] Concur, I was doing just that until my plan failed, then, knowing his ranking advantage increases exponentially with less pieces, it is fun just to prevent mate...besides I might get a draw :D  Thanks!} Kg7 29. Kb2 {My only goal now is to delay his movements } Ne2 {Ok, here is where I make a blatent mistake, as opposed to just the ignorant ones earlier.} 30. Rh2 {h3 indicated, but not done.} Nxg3 31. Rg2 {Shifting into full defensive mode to see how much longer I can last.} Ne4 32. Rg4 Rf5 33. Kc2 a6 {Here comes blatent error two, now we will see why I am where I am.} 34. Kd3 {Wella!} Nf2+ 35. Kc3 Nxg4 36. Kd3 {Now I revert to "You ain't checkmating me before I run out of time (had about 45 seconds left)} Rxf4 {Let's throw away the only defense I have.} 37. Ke2 Rxd4 38. Kf3 Ne5+ 39. Ke3 {Time to run out my clock making three second moves while stopping him from immediately mating me.} Ra4 40. Kd2 Rxa2+ 41. Kc3 b6 42. Kb3 Ra5 {Times out, I successfully stopped him from checkmating me before I ran out of time.  Ok, not really a victory, but probally one of my best games against a chess master.}
