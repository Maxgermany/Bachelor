1. e4 e5 2. f4 {Kings Gambit} exf4 {Accepted} 3. Nf3 Be7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. e5 {White also could consider D4} Ng4 6. d4 {?! Would normally expect to see Bc4} Ne3 {Bh4+ looks stronger} 7. Bxe3 fxe3 8. Bc4 {A little later than expected.} d6 9. O-O {Qd3 first with the option of castling queenside looks more accurate.} O-O 10. Qd3 Nc6 11. exd6 cxd6 {Bd6 seems better} 12. Rae1 Bg4 13. Rxe3 {White has a nice balance} Kh8 14. Nd5 Bg5 15. Nxg5 {White has control of open & semi open file.} Qxg5 16. Rg3 {Pin on bishop} Qh5 17. Ne3 {! this is effective repositioning of the knight; will force black to exchange his main defender of the kings side} Bd7 18. Nf5 Bxf5 19. Rxf5 Qh4 20. c3 {Defending and reenforcing pawn chain} Qe7 21. Re3 {Queen will now be driven to a weaker square} Qd7 22. Ref3 Nd8 23. Qe4 {! As well preventing e6 Queen now has access to H file} g6 24. Qh4 Rg8 {If black takes rook, Qf6+, Kg8, Rg3#} 25. Rf5xf7 {Black resigns with mate looming. Sharp & powerful game for white. }
