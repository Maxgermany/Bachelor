1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The Najdorf variation, my consistent choice.} 6. Bc4 {This is the Sozin treatment against the Najdorf, which was Fischer's favorite weapon.} Nc6 {Typical and better is 6. ...e6, the move recommended by theory, making White's Bishop "bite on granite." This careless transposition leads to the loss of a pawn after 7. Nc6 bc6.  8. e5 Nd5; or just a nasty positional cramp after 8. ...Ng8; with 8. ...de5  9. Qd8 also very ugly; and after 8. ...Ng4  9. e6! is deep washookie for Black.} 7. O-O e6 8. Bg5 Be7 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. e5 Nd5 {Black can get away with this now because of the shepherding pawns on c6 and e6.} 11. Bxe7 Qxe7 12. exd6 Qxd6 13. Nxd5 cxd5 {Of course: 13. ...ed5 allows white to gain a tempo for development and an attack after 14. Re1.} 14. Bb3 O-O 15. c4 Bb7 16. Rc1 d4 {Black creates a passed pawn to match White's while opening the strategically important h1-a8 diagonal. But the speculative text move is very dangerous because it basically cedes control of the Q-side to White, who will get an automatic jumpstart for his attack because he can tempo immediately on the Black Queen with the pawn-push to c5. The position has become razor-sharp.} 17. c5 Qd7 {17. ...Qc6 is routinely thwarted by 18. f3 e5, after which Black's Q is arguably misplaced on just about any light square on the Q-side. I wanted to give White ways to go wrong.} 18. Ba4 Bc6 {Believe it or not, the text is a deliberate sac to activate Black's Rooks. Had I wanted to play for the draw I would have simply moved the Q to d5 after which 19. f3 would have led back to the previous note.} 19. Bxc6 Qxc6 20. Qxd4 Rfd8 21. Qc4 {Not the most accurate. White does better with 21. Qc3 which stops Black's next.} Rd2 {Nasty. Black plays for an attack, gaining time by attacking the weakling at b2.} 22. b4 {The die is cast now. Black has successfully forced an ending where he will play for mate while White plays to push pawns until he gains an extra Queen. Whose outcome is likelier? ...Well, that's why we play the games, isn't it? To answer questions just like that.} Rad8 23. a4 h6 {This adds fuel to White's fire, but Black has to negate the back-rank weakness. Black will play the rest of the game as if liquid oxygen flows through his veins: he must acquiesce himself to the possibility of allowing White a second Queen in return for a mating attack.} 24. b5 axb5 25. axb5 Qc7 26. b6 Qb8 27. Qb5 Rd8d5 28. g3 {There! White has been distracted into thinking his King is in more danger than it actually is, inducing him to make cracks in his own wall rather than aggressively pushing those connected passed pawns involving themes like 28. Qc6 - Ra1 with the idea of Ra8.} h5 {Now Black hurries to persuade White to make even more weaknesses around his King.} 29. Qa6 h4 30. b7 hxg3 31. fxg3 {Disaster! White completely opens almost every possible attacking line to his King, thinking, no doubt, that the inevitability of queening a pawn has put the game in the bag.} Qe5 32. Qa3 Qe4 33. Qf3 {Has Black bundered away the game? I thought so for a moment, my finger hovering over a resignation. Then I saw that while White gets a check, one is all he gets. So, reason to play on.} Qb4 34. Qxf7+ Kh7 35. c6 Rb2 36. Qxe6 Qd4+ 37. Kh1 Rh5 {Black threatens mate in 2.} 38. h4 Re5 39. Qc4 Ree2 {Reopening the mate in 2 threat!} 40. Rc2 Rbxc2 41. Qxc2+ Rxc2 42. b8=Q {White gets his shiny new Queen at last! But just in time for...} Qe4+ {And White resigned.}
