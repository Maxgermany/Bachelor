1. e4 e6 2. d4 {Changing from my preferred line with d3.} d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ndf3 {It seems a dull move, but I thought the g1 knight could develop anyway.} cxd4 8. cxd4 Qb6 9. Ne2 Be7 10. h4 {In this game, losing a "good castling" on the kingside is normal. } f6 11. g4 fxe5 12. fxe5 O-O {Black's checks on the black diagonal doesn't lead to a real advantage for him... maybe. } 13. Bg2 Qd8 14. a3 {He's cramped, so I can consolidate my position. } Nb6 15. b3 Bd7 16. g5 Be8 17. Nf4 Qd7 {Being black, I would have considered RxN, followed by Bh5.} 18. Bh3 Nd8 19. Rg1 a5 20. g6 Rxf4 21. gxh7+ Kh8 22. Bxf4 Bh5 23. Bg4 Bg6 24. Ng5 Bxg5 25. hxg5 {Blocks my own BSB, but opens the h column. } Kxh7 {Mistake! He should use my own pawn to protect his king. } 26. Rh1+ Kg8 27. Bh5 Bf5 28. g6 Nc6 29. Ra2 a4 30. Rah2 Ne7 31. Rg1 axb3 32. Bg5 Bc2 33. Rxc2 {Returning the quality, and exposign myself to an attack on the c column and the black diagonal. If he uses it, I'm lost. } bxc2 34. Qxc2 Nf5 {But he doesn't go for it.} 35. Bd1 Rxa3 36. Qh2 Nh6 37. Bxh6 gxh6 38. g7 Qb5 {Now is too late. } 39. Qf4 Nd7 {His only chance is to harass my king with checks. } 40. Qf7+ {Sure he didn't expect this one...}
