1. e4 {This is my third game.This is not my last game that I want to show you but , I dont have any more of them yet after few weeks or month I will try to show you more of this creativity.If you liked this opening and/or you have some Questions about it or you want just to talk about other variations or problems in this opening I would like to hear your thoughts.just mail to me:                              KingsGambitInfo@yahoo.com                                             --- K.G.I. ---} e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d5 {Seems to be a populated move like g5.Black tries to not defend the pawn but immideatly play in the center.} 4. exd5 Qxd5 {A beginer mistake. It was better to play Nf6 and after Bb5  c6! or Bc4 Nxd5 0-0} 5. Nc3 {A tempo more,why not?} Qe6+ 6. Qe2 {Kf2! was a stronger move with a dangerous threat Bb5  followed by Re1 loosing the queen. Still white can exchange the queens with good lead in development} Bd6 {A natural developing move and defending the f4 pawn.If pawn on f4 will be protected well whites game will be harder but it was proven that defending this pawn gives black another trouble} 7. Nb5 {good move!I liked this move very much.White threat is unstoppble to win the f4 pawn} Na6 8. Nxd6+ cxd6 9. Qxe6+ {Qxe6 ?! it was better to play immideate d4.now black has fxe6 and no more isolated pawn but after white takes the queen,we should mention that he is free his bishop} Bxe6 10. Bb5+ Bd7 11. Bxa6 bxa6 {In this game I didnt play correctly and made many mistakes.Anyway I want that you take a look at this position.He cannot defend the pawn on f4,the d6 weak,a6 a7 pawn are doubled isolated pawns.So white is pretty better.} 12. d4 Rc8 13. c3 Nf6 14.
