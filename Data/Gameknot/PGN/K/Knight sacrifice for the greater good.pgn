1. d4 {Queens pawn opening. } d5 {Respond symetrically } 2. c4 {Queens Gambit } c6 {Queens Gambit not accepted  Slav Defense } 3. Nc3 {Putting pressure on d5 } Nf6 {Added protection for d5 while preparing for Kingside Castle } 4. h3 {Stops my Knight and Bishop from reaching g4 } g6 {Preparing to fianchetto and Castle } 5. Bf4 {Challenges my Knight and stops my Queen from advancing } Bg7 {Fianchetto - looking to add pressure to the middle when things start to open up } 6. e3 {Defending d4 and opening up the Kingside for his Queen as well as adding another defender to c4 } Bf5 {Making sure his Queen can't reach g4 and putting it in a more active position } 7. c5 {Pushes locking the pawns momentarely and opeing up space for his Bishop to move } Nbd7 {Not letting him open up my queenside and developing my Knight } 8. Bd3 {Attacking my Bishop trying to break my Kingside pawn structure.  } Ne4 {Lifting the Knight exposing my fianchetto Bishop and putting an attacker on d4 } 9. Qc2 {Moves his Queen to protect his Knight and Bishop and b2 pawn } O-O {I didn't want to take his Knight here becasue of his Battery down to my Kingside pawn structure. } 10. Nxe4 {He captures my Knight, but leaves b2 slightly open with only a pawn obstrucing my Bishops scope and only a Queen defending. } Bxe4 {Recapture to get material back and force a Bishop trade. } 11. Bxe4 dxe4 {Gives him contorl of the middle and entices him to take my pawn and leave b2 undefended. } 12. Qxe4 {Here he was threatening and i am down a pawn in but I had fianchetto my Bishop and it was eying his Rook and the only way for me to get at the rook was to force d4 to move.  He can't take anything else with his Queen and it draws his Queen out from behind its defenses and leaves it with no defenders, and by drawing out his Queen (since he had not Castled yet) I could take away his right to Castle and draw him off the back line. } Qa5+ {I put him in check so I could pair my Rooks and put pressure on c5 which could force d4 off its spot. } 13. Ke2 {He moves his King to saftey (better is Kf1 I think) } Nxc5 {Here is where I made a huge choice to sacrifice my Knight so I could take his b7 and a7 pawns.  I knew it would put me down in materiel (one Knight for 2 pawns) but I felt like even though I would be down in material I would have some things going for me (passed pawn, his King exposed, and his rook under distress.)  I knew he wouldn't resist the temptation to play dxc5 and he would still think he was in a solid attacking position, but after I play Bxb2, he is immediately on the defense.   } 14. dxc5 {He takes my bait (I know that was probably considered a bad move, but I got good return for my investment.  Qxc5 is also a good move } Bxb2 {Putting pressure on his Rook he has to sacrifice his a pawn to keep it. In the actual game I played Qxc5 with the idea of Bxb2 afterwords but after I played Qxc5 he blundered and played b3 and I took his Rook and he resigned.  But I still wanted to look at the position I would have been playing from if he didn't blunder.  } 15. Rb1 {Puts pressure on my Bishop and moves it to safety. } Qxa2 {I take his a pawn, protect my Bishop and create a passed pawn.  I trade my Knight for 2 pawns and a passed pawn. } 16. Qc2 {He puts pressure on my Bishop and threatens my Queen. } Qa6+ {I bring my Queen to safety protect my passed pawn and check him, which gives me time to get my Bishop out of harms way. } 17. Ke1 {He peals back (earlier I said Kf1 is better) if he played that, he still ends up in the same position here. } Bg7 {My Bishop is back to its Sniping position his Queen-side is completely exposed.  In the actual game I played he blundered and resigned, but this is a possible position I could have been in with my sacrifice}
