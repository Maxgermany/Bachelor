[Opening "KGA (C33), bishop's gambit"]

1. e4 {I usually play d4 first move but recently i saw a beautiful game with a variation in king's gambit that i never saw before: 3.Bc4 instead of Nf3. I thought that in king's gambit not to play 3.Nf3 is madness.I already won 2 or 3 games with this variation and lost only one.I like it very much because it leads to open game with great attacking potential from both sides. So i start with e4 and hope for e5 } e5 {e5 it is} 2. f4 exf4 {ok, the gambit is accepted } 3. Bc4 {As I said, I thought that anything else than Nf3 is suicide but apparently it isn't :)} Bc5 {In the game that made me fall in love with this variation, 3rd move from black is Qh4  and Bc5 is 4th move continued with 5. d4 } 4. Bxf7+ Kxf7 5. Qh5+ g6 6. Qd5+ {I was hoping that he'll move the king to f8 maybe and then i can take the bishop with tempo, i had nothing to lose with this move, just postponing on taking the bishop} Kg7 7. Qxc5 d6 8. Qc4 {f7 square is very important for my attack because i'll try to castle and open up f file for my rook } Nf6 9. Nf3 h6 10. d4 g5 {protecting f-pawn, it took him 2 moves to do that} 11. Nc3 {don't know why i made that move... 0-0 was better} Re8 {first sign of aggression from him} 12. e5 Bf5 {can't take the knight because the pawn is pinned} 13. O-O Ne4 14. Nh4 {my first try to open up the f file if he takes then 15. Rxf4 an from my analysis the worst case scenario for me is winning a pawn which isn't so bad :) } Bh7 {he decides not to take it and moves the bishop to safety maybe Be6 is better here, attacking my queen} 15. Bxf4 {ok, time for the second try} Nxc3 {not  accepting the sacrifice again, but the file is open now} 16. Bxg5 hxg5 {he finally accepts the sacrifice and it allows me a nice cobination for the end} 17. Rf7+ Kh8 {this or Kh6 is pretty much the same he can hold it a little longer by playing Kg8 but the result is the same-->checkmate } 18. Rxh7+ Kxh7 {forced} 19. Qf7+ {and he resigns if Kh8 -> Ng6# if Kh6 -> Qg6#  for the next few games king's gambit is my openning :) }
