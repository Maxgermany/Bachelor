1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. b3 Bg7 4. Bb2 O-O {Mike: This is my standard opening. So far so good.  Joe: Yes.  So far, it's all mainlines.} 5. Nf3 {Not knowing exactly how to continue, my rule of thumb is continue developing, as much as, possible.} d6 {Mike: D6 is to escape to if necessary.  Joe: It's a good move for more then just an escape, though. This also develops and gives you a good place to do that, without the loss of tempo, either.  Mike: Most of the blitz game has white controlling the left side of the board. So this a bit of a learning curve  With the pawns, I meant.  Joe: It all depends on the position. I'd say that with the KID, that is what you want. But, the difference is that they're playing fast. In games, like this, it's long correspondence. So, you take the time and see where you get from there. } 6. g3 {Not knowing exactly what to do and feeling pressure with my semi cramped position, I, reluctantly, decided to ignore what Ken and I discussed in our game.  He mentioned, that it's generally not a good idea to do two fianchettos in the KID.  But, that is what I did here to give my student a challenge since he doesn't expect. In fact, that will be mentioned on the next move.  My idea is getting him used to something that he hasn't seen before.  The goal is pressure because of what Ken noted which I mentioned later on.  It's about making things difficult for the student so that they really need to struggle and figure out the best move.} Nc6 {Mike: Kb6. Developing.I thought about pinning the knight but it seemed pointless.  Joe: Yes because, it wasn't possible with the second fianchetto, which you don't typically see in the KID. I changed things up. But, were I to stick with mainlines and play 6.e3, and then you answered with 6...Bg4, I would've broken that pin, at once, with 7.Be2.  Part of the idea behind that comment was something that Ken mentioned which is the question well what if I played something different.  He did that to get me aware of multiple threats, so what I'm saying is that it wouldn't work because of this.  The idea is getting Mike to calculate multiple, as opposed to, only one variation which is a common problem. } 7. d5 {This is where I start putting on the pressure and giving him something to think about.  It's similar to a variation (introduced by Susan Polgar) that you see in the French Defense, but it works here.  Mike: I considered fianchtto the bishop. But I didn't have much developed , in case I got attacked.  Joe: Yes, developing your pieces early is, in general, a good idea. On the other hand, there are exceptions to those guidelines. What it boils down is when to deviate from the guidelines. In general, that happens when you're a dealing with a nasty threat and must do it to answer the threat.  Now, that comment was based on what I learned from, "he who must not be named."  But, the fact is true guidelines are just guidelines.  But, the overall story is that sometimes, you must deviate from them to save the position or prevent trouble which is the logic behind this conversation. } Ne5 {Mike:  Moving the knight to see what you may want to capture  Joe: Yes, that is a good idea. It's about knowing what the opponent can do.  Mike: Exactly.  Even though that was a good idea, I later had to edit the comment because where he moved it was a mistake.  So, later on even though I said it was a mistake with the idea of losing something, I calculated a line that would've given him a pawn back.  So, what I later said was that it was inaccurate because it would still cause problems.  If he wanted to see where I might capture, better would've been 7...Nb4 or 7...Nb8.} 8. Nxe5 dxe5 {Mike: After thinking about it for a few minutes, I decided to take the knight. I wanted to set up an attack via putting the knight bak to d6. I know I'm opened to an attack.  This is the part when I think too much   I think you'll bring kb2. I was thinking putting your bishop to e5. See what happens.  Edit kb3  Joe: Well, it is good to think ahead. But, you don't want to do too much, at one time. That's true.  Mike: Which is why I took the knight. I'm not developed to make one of my signature crazy moves lol.  Joe:  I figured that you took. The other move I thought about was the possibility of 8...Ne4. But, then, I'd answer with 9.Nc6 and put pressure. That's the move that might have protected the pawn. But, by taking, black loses a pawn now because, I'm going to capture on e5.    } 9. Bxe5 e6 { } 10. d6 {? I could've exchanged pawns, which probably would've been better.  But, as previously noted, I wanted to give something else to think about.  By doing this, there is more pressure and we're approaching a more difficult position here.  I'm interested in how he handles this.  The idea is making things more difficult as a bigger problem which Ken outlined.  But, this is a mistake from my side, as this gets him a pawn back.  Mike: No, I don't want your pawn on d5  The king side castle is getting cluttered  Joe: That is true.   } cxd6 11. Bxd6 {?? Calculating only two variations since Ken said that I should do more then one.  But, that is not nearly enough here.  Much better was to exchange with 11.Bxf6  Instead, I was fixated on being a pawn up but missed what the board was trying to tell me here, as now, he is going to win my Rook with a discovered, and leaving me with the pressure.  This blunder, though, was caused by the rough week I had at work that I noted to Ken since I was also rilded up.  Which makes the second game that a work situation led to a terrible blunder.} Ng4 {And, it starts with this move.  Sure, I also get a rook, but it should not be enough compensation because of how he responds by picking up my Bishop.} 12. Bxf8 Qxf8 {Mike: I need my Queen...not sure where yet  Joe: Yes, that Queen is very important.  Mike: Putting my pawn on e6 was a big mistake.  Joe: Yes, I think what you calculated was that I'd take then Bishop takes back, and then we have the Queen exchange. And, I almost did that. But, I advanced it a square further to compromise the position. After which, white wound up ahead.  Now, I said this to alleviate the problems that I caused for myself with that terrible of capturing on d6, as opposed to, f6.  Mike:  I regret a couple moves. I'm confused. Do I have a chance?  Joe: You do.  By that, I'm saying that he should not resign and implying that I'm in trouble to make life easier on my student so that he gains confident.  This is one way that I used to show lienency before finding out that I had to be cruel.  Here: I'm saying that he shouldn't give up, and Jack Stockel used similar methods with me which is actually how I became a good player and starting teaching chess before becoming a 1200 rated player since my lowest rating was 851.} 13. Bh3 {Not knowing what to do, I attack his N.} Qb4+ {And, he places me in check which I get out of.} 14. Kf1 f5 {Protecting his N.} 15. Qd8+ {This is Hope Chess as Mike has a threat against my Rook, which I was hoping that he'd miss by interceding with his Bishop.  I'm not surprised that it didn't work, though.} Qf8 {Mike: Only thing that could think of to block.  Joe: This is your best move.  After this, I willingly exchange Queens, but not for the thrills of it like you saw before because of what Ken noted.  Instead, I felt that his Queen was a nasty threat, and thus, felt that I had to do something to that.  My answer to that is getting rid of it since I felt under pressure with that Queen.  I don't think it was a mistake since I should've fallen.  But, were it not for the rough work week, I might have retreated, as opposed to, especially bearing in mind that it caused me to forget that important lecture with Kenneth_fiore_3.} 16. Qxf8+ Kxf8 17. f3 {Knowing that he'll take my Rook, I think of something.  So, I go on the offense, knowing that when he takes, I'll get a N, in return and will remain the equivalent to a pawn up.} Bxa1 {Mike: Taking that free rook} 18. fxg4 {Joe: I figured that you would. That was right into calculation, which is why I attacked the N. It was a move earlier that I had to figure out what to do, knowing that my Ra1 was a goner. With that being said, this is not a free Rook, but you have compensated for what you were down before. } g5 {Mike: Okay.  Now, I'm stuck.  Any suggestions?  Joe: You're down by an equivalent to a pawn. My advice is to keep fighting on because anything can happen here. It's an interesting endgame, and we generally don't approach that phase in less then 20 moves. But, we are here. And, anything can change. As my coach says, "Don't give up right away." } 19. gxf5 {Mike: I messed up a long time sgo. Fight on  I don't know what to do.  I'm lost.  Can we go back a few moves for another variation?  Joe: Well, we can't play those few moves back, but I can go over it. Ok, so let's go back to what you mentioned about ...e6  You're plan on that 9th move, with the Queen's facing each other, I believe, was 10.dxe6 because of 10...Qxe1, 11.Qxe1 The idea behind exchanging those Queens, is on top of the loss of castling rights, my monarch is misplaced, in the aftermath. However, I wasn't going to enable to that, so I had played 10.d6, advancing that pawn one square. Then, however, I took d6 with the Bishop which was a mistake as it was then that you were going to get my Rook. Yes, I took that Rook before, but better was to exchange N for B on f6. But, after getting my Rook, your Ng4 was en-prise. So, I did get a N, in return. There's still plenty to fight for, and the position is not beyond saving, yet.  Mike: I agree.  I feel stuck.  Gonna work outsomething.  Joe: That is the spirit, Mike.  Worth noting is that this is the type of advice that Jack Stockel gave to me which I'm using to teach Mike.  } g4 {? This is where it starts to go downhill, though.  Joe: This is the second mistake, Mike. I know you wanted to hit my B. But, better was to retake with 19...exf5 And, I couldn't recapture with 20.Bxf5?? due to your Bc8. By playing this, however, you wind up two pawns down.  Mike: I'm confused. I really don't know what to do from here. I'll play it out. I posted a game on the gameknot chess page on FB. I'm stumped on that  Joe: The idea is pressure. And, as I recently learned from a chess coach, pressure is about not knowing what to do. Mike: I'm feeling the pressure.  Joe:  Yes, this has become a very difficult position. By not taking you wound up another pawn down. But, what I recently learned is that a coach's job is to make the position more difficult, as then, it's up to the student to figure out what to do, from there.  BTW, the coach that I was alluding to in that conversation was Ken.} 20. Bxg4 b6 {? Instead of taking back, he advances b7. } 21. fxe6 {Which enables me to win, yet another pawn.  From here, the conversation resumes, and there was a typo as I meant his last move but accidently said his 22nd move.  I think the conversation was here, and no later on, though.  } Ke7 22. Kg2 h5 23. Bf3 {Mike: What was I supposed to take?  Joe: Best was 22...Bxe6, and if I had played 23.Bxe6, 23...Kxe6 and you're down but have compensated a pawn.} Rb8 24. Bxh5 Bxe6 25. Nd2 Bc3 26. Ne4 Be5 27. Ng5 Bd7 {Mike: Can we end this game and let me be black? i want to try out another variatiin.  Joe:  Yes. Although I didn't want to say it, I think that resignation is no longer premature. A pawn is a pawn, but now, you're down a piece and pawn without compensation. I could start a new one, when time allows.  Thus, he resigned here.  What I didn't mention was the moral because this was at the end of the rough week.  But, it's something that I, earlier this year, learned from Jack Stockel.  That is, to take more time in the endgame.  If you make a mistake in the opening or midgame, you usually can get out of it.  However, one mistake in the endgame usually means the end of the Rome, as what happened here.}
