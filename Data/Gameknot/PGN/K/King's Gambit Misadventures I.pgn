1. e4 e5 2. f4 {I have been studying the King's Gambit a lot since late May and have found it to be an extremely interesting opening.  With enough studying under my belt, I decided it was time to venture forth from theory to practice.  (This has been the only opening I have studied heavily thus far, and I'm still not a pro at it by any means.)  I have already had some very interesting games on-line and OTB.  One thing I have noticed is that unlike other openings, the King's Gambit has a tendency to lead white to quick victory in the mid-game (as in this game) or disastrous defeat in the end due to piece sacrifices.  I wasn't originally planning on annotating these games and making this a pseudo-series, but then I realized the Gameknot community might have a lot to share/learn with/from me with regards to my moves (and perhaps enjoy mocking me).  (Like "you idiot, why didn't you see this move, you could have totally had him" or "you orangutan, go read 'crying like a Grandmaster' by GM Ben Finegold.")  I will also be including in this pseudo-series annotations of Grandmaster level games.  Without much further ado, I give you my first very successful game that celebrates the King's Gambit ferocity.  I hope you enjoy it and comments/feedback on moves made are greatly appreciated!} Nf6 {It's the Petrov Defense in the King's Gambit Declined line.  This is an interesting way to decline the King's Gambit because rather than taking the offered pawn and free threat of check on Qh4, black has elected to threaten the e4 pawn in an attempt to arrest white's center control.  Not to say this opening is a mistake, but I think this response gives white some time back because now the black queen cannot threaten check for at least a turn.  White's best moves here, in my opinion, are fxe5, Bc4, d3, Nc3 or Nf3.  In the King's Gambit, it is often important to develop the King side and castle rapidly.  Bobby Fischer loved the move Bc4, even in the accepted line- the so called Bishop's Gambit.  Nf6 by black gives white the opportunity to do this a bit earlier.  Although I think it's a good move, I personally don't like d3 in the King's Gambit unless I'm ready to spend a move on d4 in the future because d3 makes developing the light square bishop harder and honestly cramps the King's Gambit style.  There are also games where the King's gambit transposes into less aggressive games about position and center control and other theory that I still don't have a firm grasp on yet.  (I'm still studying lines around d4.  That might be a good move here, too.)  Nf3 is a bit too passive at this moment in the Petrov Defense, but it isn't terrible.  Nc3 is also passive but is better here because it protects the e4 pawn, develops the queen side knight and opens the a1 rook for later use; if you play the King's Gambit right, I can almost guarantee every piece from c1 to h1 will be developed quickly.  However, it transposes the game to a Vienna Gambit in a Vienna Game, which is not bad, but if you want to play a Vienna Gambit, I'd suggest a different order of moves.  The a1 rook sometimes feels like a missed asset in my games.  In fact, if I had had earlier access to it in some of my other games, I would have definitely won.  I would say the next move here is a matter of taste for white.} 3. fxe5 {In this game, I decided to gobble up the e5 pawn.  This does a lot of good for white for three reasons: One, because it forces black to respond with his knight, he either under-develops or takes the e4 pawn; two, it brings a pawn to the e5 square, which quite frankly can cramp black's game and become extra fodder against black depending (and as we will see in this game); and, three, because taking the e4 pawn is absolutely what black will do, this brings the knight into an isolated square that makes it prone to early game harassment and potentially an easy capture.  (Note, that the knight will now no longer be able to move back to d6 or f6 because of the e5 pawn.)} Nxe4 4. Nf3 {At this point, white must play Nf3 or g3 to prevent Qh4+.  (There might actually be other moves white can make.  I haven't actually considered others yet.  Let me know if you find others.)  The pawn to g3 is definitely rubbish compared to Nf3 since the latter develops a piece and clears the king side for castling.  For those of you still very new to the King's Gambit, consider what would happen if play went like this: 4. a3 Qh4+.  What can white do in this situation?  See if you can identify the permutations; it isn't too challenging.} Bc5 {This is, I'm pretty sure, black's first mistake.  I'm not sure just how bad it is, but it definitely gives white tempo.  The obvious threat is either Nf2 or Bf2.  Either one will take away castling rights (I'd like Bf2 better because it brings the king to an uncomfy square), but the only real move white can make to counter this is arguably the best move.  Not only will black have to respond by retreating the bishop (or be down material, but we'll assume that's not an option), it also further isolates the knight by taking away the c5 square for retreat.} 5. d4 {The obvious move.} Be7 {It was either this move (Be7) or Bb6.  I think Be7 is probably the best move black can make because it provides some material to defend the king side, which is what the King's Gambit aims to obliterate for black as far as I understand the opening, and provides two defenders on the g5 square- the only square black's knight can feasibly run away to.  Bb6 could make the dark square bishop useless for black for most of the game considering white's pawn structure.  Bb4+ is also complete rubbish because it gives white free development with c3.  (As white, do not play Nc3 to defend against Bb4+.  If it isn't obvious, I recommend the reader play the permutation out and find the winning moves for black as an exercise.)} 6. Bd3 {At this point in the game, I felt it was important for me to consider where I could sacrifice my pieces- yes, sacrifice them.  Back in ye olde days of chess, when this opening was still played competitively, Grandmasters were encouraged to play "gutsy" and wild by sacrificing their pieces for positional advantages.  I considered playing Bc4 with the idea of potentially sacrificing my bishop on f7 to bring black's king out.  I have seen this sacrificial play made before.  (I'll provide a reference game once I find it in my notes and update this post.)  However, in this position, it looked like black was going to castle king side, so if bringing his king out was the positional advantage I was looking for, then d3 was a better square for my bishop.  Plus it threatens his knight and gives me more tempo.  Yay!} Ng5 {Tactical puzzle ahead!  Scroll down one frame at a time if you don't want spoilers!} 7. O-O {I didn't want to trade pieces because although we'd trade even, it wouldn't do much for me in the way of position.  His knight now has Nxf3 or Ne6 in the way of moves.  If he takes my knight, then I could simply develop my queen and put it in file with my rook on his f7 pawn.  It would put black in a position where castling king side seems favorable (especially with my e5 pawn there), which is what any player utilizing the King's Gambit will often want.  Because this opening is often attempting to pulverize black's king side pawn structure, for black to castle king side is giving white a positional edge... in my opinion.} O-O {Try to not look ahead to the next frame from here!  He elects to castle, and this is where the fireworks start for white.  (It is my strong opinion, and I welcome arguments against this opinion, but I think black should never castle king side if he can help it against the King's Gambit.)  I didn't see anything in this position at first, but then I left on a brief vacation.  Despite my girlfriend's best attempts to distract me, my mind often came back to this game.  I really wanted to have a super successful King's Gambit game.  A lot of my OTB games and various other online games were almost successful, but failed because I couldn't see mating sequences or positional traps fast enough.  Perhaps some of the readers already see the sequence; if you don't, consider this a tactical puzzle for you to crack!  If you get impatient, read on!} 8. Nxg5 {This just trades even, right?} Bxg5 9. Bxh7+ {Actually it doesn't.  This is where the bishop sacrifice I was already considering comes into use.  Once more, I feel like I have seen this sacrifice before even if the position was slightly different.  I'll be looking for references in a bit, but if someone else knows one already, please share it!} Kxh7 {Black decides to nom a "free" bishop.} 10. Qh5+ {Now my queen is active.} Bh6 {His king is temporarily safe, but now his bishop is pinned.} 11. Rf6 {This is perhaps the key move in the tactical puzzle; without this move, the bishop sacrifice at 9. Bxh7+ doesn't seem worth it.  Even in this position, though, I have to admit I wasn't first convinced this position was any good.  It felt good, but I wanted to be sure.  It seemed like black could simply take a free rook, right?  Of course, if he does, then the white queen takes black's bishop forcing the black king into a corner on the g8 square.  This should be real bad for black and a mating net probably existed, but I wasn't sure.  This is perhaps another tactical exercise for the reader; can you identify what can happen to black if he plays 11. ... gxf6?  I'll provide a hint to the solution in two slides (look for $$).  Once I determined taking the rook with the pawn was bad news for black, I decided this whole line starting from 8. Nxg5 was worth it.  I would, of course welcome a rook and bishop for queen trade.  I want to post a puzzle here for this, but I don't know for sure if this (the permutation where he captures the rook with the pawn) is a guaranteed mate yet.  I merely mapped things out in the game until I either reached checkmate for black or decided the new position for black was terrible for him.  } Kg8 {The idea is ok, but I'm not sure this was the best move black could have made.  Black wants to free his bishop from the pin so it can become useful again.  If it were me, I would consider getting the light square bishop or b8 knight into the game ASAP!  Maybe black did consider this; maybe there are simply no good moves left here.  I haven't yet considered what would happen if black decided along these lines instead because black elected this move.  I simply focused mental energies on what happened.} 12. Bxh6 {After more careful thought, I decided taking with the bishop was the best move.  What's funny is that I first considered queen sacrifices and then rook sacrifices.  Maybe I like playing classically "gutsy" chess.  Here is yet another puzzle to solve for the reader.  What are the sequences that guarantee checkmate here?  If white plays correctly here, he will win.  I'm not this good yet; I admit to making a flow chart of moves using pen and paper to help me here, and I still missed some moves black made.  $$ The hint to the solution to 11. ... gxf6 is 12. Qxh6+ Kg7 13. exf6 ... .  It should only be moderately difficult to solve from there.  I would like to mention that I didn't see every permutation through to the end during the game.  (Also, can someone tell me how to indent my paragraphs.  Is it possible?)} Qxf6 {Black attempts to stop checkmate with this queen sacrifice.  Luckily, this only delays checkmate rather than stopping it.} 13. exf6 {Pawn takes, and now the moves white has are pretty easy to see.} g6 {This is a good move.  I had forgotten to consider this move when I was in the game and was worried that this might buy black enough time to stop mate.  Even though I'm up in material, I was still worried about this game turning into another near victory, which many of my King's Gambit games have been.  Especially OTB games- mostly due to time constraints; I don't have the luxury of lots of time to think.  Qh3 is bad because it makes d5 an option for black, which may actually prevent checkmate... .  I haven't actually studied that line yet, I simply avoided moving my queen into harm's way of black's bishop.  When I have the time, I'll look into it and update this post to include the outcome of that and other lines I have mentioned but not fully considered.} 14. Qh4 {Fortunately, checkmate is still guaranteed in this position.  Here my opponent resigned.  I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and it is because of crazy games like this, that I love the King's Gambit!  By turn 10, every piece from d1 to h1 (minus the king) was bearing down on my opponent's king and several piece sacrifices for position were made.  I think I love making sacrifices.  I wonder if any of you share my same burning passion for this opening.  Please feel free to comment on this, and if you want to hear more King's Gambit games, consider liking this annotation?  I'll probably keep making annotations when I have the time because I sense I learn a lot when I do, but it's nice to know someone else is enjoying them, too.  The next King's Gambit game I review will be an OTB game I played against my professor (names will be excluded for privacy's sake) that I nearly won, but failed to do so.  I think it will highlight some of the pitfalls of the King's Gambit and also show the importance of being good at tactical puzzles when playing this opening.  Until the next installment!  I hope you enjoyed this very short game!}
