1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 {Saemisch  } O-O 6. Bg5 c5 {Opting for the Bennoni. I play c5 when white plays the Saemisch or the four pawns attack} 7. d5 a6 8. a4 {White stops my counter attack on the queenside. Since the d & c pawns are fixed and my e7, d6, c5 pawn chain points to the queen side; you then attack on that side.} h6 {Knocking off the bishop} 9. Be3 Nbd7 {And here I missed e6, one of the crucial moves in forming a bennoi formation. But I never play it!} 10. Nh3 Qa5 {playing the queenside. If 10. f4...Nxe4!} 11. Nf2 Ne5 12. Bd2 {12. f4...Neg4} Qb4 {Making a bold move! Do you think White could have trap my Queen?} 13. b3 {?? a poor move} Qb6 14. Be2 {misssing a5} g5 {I play a gambit to open the a1-h8 diagonal and to activate my bishop. The King's Indian can go for a long time so it's best to start the attack. (Or 14...h5 15. f4...Neg4)} 15. f4 Ng6 {Moving the Knights in order to free my bishop} 16. fxg5 hxg5 {Yes the pawn is unprotected} 17. Bxg5 Nh7 {Moving the second knight and offering yet another pawn!?} 18. Bd2 {Best. If Bxe7...BxNc3  } Nf4 {The bishop is overloaded with work} 19. O-O Nxe2+ {Now I have the bishop pair} 20. Qxe2 Bd7 {Now I had to regroup and I was going to play e6 but never got around to it} 21. Rab1 Qd8 22. Ncd1 f5 {Opening the f file} 23. Nd3 b5 24. a5 {??} b4 {!} 25. Ne1 Qxa5 26. Nd3 {?? what was white thinking?} fxe4 27. Rxf8+ Rxf8 28. Nd3f2 Qa2 29. Rc1 Bd4 30. Kh1 Rxf2 31. Nxf2 e3 32. Ne4 exd2 33. Nxd2 {white resign.  I hardly thought twice, and I didn't, about sacrificing the rook to fork White's pieces with my pawn, But I am glad white resing because I was somewhat scared of the position: My king open, no rook. Tell me what you think of the position.}
