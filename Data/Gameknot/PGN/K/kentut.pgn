[Opening "French (C07), Tarrasch, open variation"]

1. e4 {Seeking a tactical game.} e6 {Black does not commit to immediate exchanges in the center and can choose from a variety of openings.} 2. d4 {A classical pawn center, controlling the center from the center and holding more ground.} d5 {Black selects the French opening and introduces a little tension in the center. The e4 square is the weakness for white - no protection, and e5 is weak for black and can be used to limit the development of the g8 knight by e4-e5 if the opportunity is taken immediately.} 3. Nd2 {This move introduces the French Tarrasch opening.  An interesting alternative is 3.c4 dxe4  4.Nc3 Nf6  5. f3 Bb4 the Diemler Duhm gambit main line. The text move leaves the d4 pawn without protection while protecting the e4 pawn, and it blocks the influence of the queen and also blocks the bishop at c1.} c5 {The French Tarrasch Open. Black contests the center immediately while neglecting both development and king safety.} 4. Ngf3 {White develops a second piece while protecting d4.} Nc6 {Last book move known to me presently. Black applies pressure to the weak d4 square with the threat of c5xd4 to follow. It is interesting to note that black while still underdeveloped, has a greater control of d4 because of the positional weakness of white having a knight on d2.} 5. exd5 {White decides that the inevidible c5xd4 could only be countered by c2-c3 - because the d2 knight can not move without dropping e4 - no queen protection for the pawn - so decides to initiate an attack. White may be reserving the queenside for castling, assuming that black will castle kingside, which means that attacking with f2-g2-h2 will be beneficial. There will be a bit of a problem with the pressure on d4 after Qd8xd5, but this may be resolved with some work. -1p} Qxd5 {-1P,-1p} 6. Bc4 {White develops and chases the queen gaining tempo.} Qd7 7. Nb3 {White regains control of d4. White stands a little better because of having a ready 0-0 available and because no diagonal attacks can be applied against the king due to the position and because of better development. The only downside may be found after c5xd4 where black will have a little better pawn center - which may mean nothing more than offering protection of f7 or supplying support at d5 for a knight.} a6 {Black pursues a course of attack. The lack of development of the the king should warn against this move. White can castle to safety and then begin operations that will have increasingly better chances at attacking the king that is still in the center at e8. The plan of b7-b5 to chase the bishop does not accomplish enough. White can counter the text move by simply playing d4-d5 where if e6xd5, then Bc4xd5 and white can play on with ease.} 8. Be3 {White still appears to be following a strategy involving 0-0-0 and continues to develop pieces. White has 4 pieces controlling d4 completely, and an assessment of the rest of the white pieces shows how white has domination in the center, while black has the drawback of limited mobility due to underdeveloped pieces and limited space and almost nonexistant open diagonals. Open diagonals are very import for bishops. White stands better positionally and is better developed.} cxd4 {Black eliminates the last center pawn to obtain a little advantage by the e6 pawn over the center. Black controls d5 because of the pawn vs pieces advantage, but white has control of more central squares, with the exception of e4. Of course there is the matter of removing the threat on d4 first that must be attended. -2P,-1p} 9. Nbxd4 {White obtains material equality. -2P,-2p} Bd6 {Black makes plans for kingside castling.} 10. Nb3 {White obtains greater control of the center with the knight on b3, but castling seems a better idea and either Qd1-e2 with the option of Nf3-d2 for coverage, or 0-0 would be a better choice. The move Qd1-d2 may obtain the annoying Bd6-b4 which would require c2-c3 blocking the attack but weakening the potential castle.} b5 {Black decides to make the queenside unwelcome and pursues the bishop. This move really helps white to move the bishop to a better position. Bc4xe6 offers nothing. Black can get away with the attack because there is no safe and open white color diagonal for white to use for an attack.} 11. Bd3 {This move has good and bad merits. The future goal of Bxh7 or supporting Qxh7 is good, but there is the matter of a possible future fork by e6-e5-e4. Perhaps Bc4-e2 is better by keeping away from a future tactic.} Nf6 {Black catches up in development and is starting to obtain a better position by developing pieces that control the center while clearing the back rank.} 12. Nc5 {White attempts to swindle a trade of B for N to obtain an advantage. Perhaps castling would be better now since black is very close to obtaining a lead in development.} Qe7 {Black turns the tide. Fortunately for white there is no target on the other side of the Q-B attack line.} 13. Ne4 {White pursues a continued attack hoping to score on the a8 rook by tactics - but the opponent will probably see this. If now Ng6xe4, Bd3xe4, then Bc8-c7 keeps both the rook and knight safe.} Bb7 {Black takes preventative measures against whites plan.} 14. Nxd6+ {White scores a bishop for knight, so maybe that was the real plan all along!  -2P,-1b-2p} Qxd6 {Maintains material equality. -1N-2P,-1b-2p} 15. O-O {White is now properly prepared to begin an attack or push a strategy, which speaking of pushing - note the majority of queenside pawns which can be pushed to advantage. White has an advantage due to the pawn majority and 2 bishops.} Ne5 {Black seeks to level the playing field, hopeing to score a bishop.} 16. Be2 {Access denied.} Qc7 {Black could force the loss of a bishop for white, but it would cost a bishop in return. A better strategy would be to keep what strength there is in having 1 bishop as opposed to none.} 17. a4 {White attempts to entice b5xa4, Ra1xa4 with the plan of obtaining a passed pawn on the c file, or if possible 2 connected passers - which would require the dispensing of at the least, the b7 bishop.} O-O {Black obtains an almost equal position, but is still less than equal because of the pawn disadvantage queenside.} 18. Nxe5 {This move does not accomplish much. The knight offers positional strength at f3, but this strength is given away without recompense.  -1N-2P,-1b-1n-2p} Qxe5 {There is a threat of Qe5xb2 next move. -2N-2P,-1b-1n-2p} 19. Bd4 {White politely asks the queen to buzz off.} Qf4 {Black hovers ominously around the kingside, but does not appear to be quite positioned for a good attack.} 20. f3 {? In retrospect, this move is not good. Bd4-e3 is better. But most players would overlook the approaching pin that was played in this game, including myself. It is a focus thing - looking at just one part of the board.} Rfd8 {! A crushing pin is applied. The turning point.} 21. c3 {A temporary patch.} e5 {!} 22. Qc1 {A good try! Maybe Bd4xe5, even so, Qxe5 and it is -2 pts instead of -3 pts and 1 bishop less - dagnabbit!} Qxc1 {-1Q-2N-2P,-1b-1n-2p} 23. Rfxc1 {-1Q-2N-2P,-1q-1b-1n-2p} exd4 {-1Q-1B-2N-2P,-1q-1b-1n-2p} 24. cxd4 {-1Q-1B-2N-2P,-1q-1b-1n-3p} b4 {Rxd4 loses to a4xb5, a6xb5, Ra1xa8+, Bb7xa8, Rc1-c8+, Rd4-d8, Rc8xd8+, Nf6-e8, Rd8xe8#} 25. Rc7 Rab8 26. Bc4 Nd5 27. Re1 Nxc7 {-1Q-1R-1B-2N-2P,-1q-1b-1n-3p  Game won, resignation, 0-1.}
