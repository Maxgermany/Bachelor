1. d3 {This game is from a tourney from the Knights of Honor club here at gameknot (we're always looking for new members to the club so feel free to stop by and take a look at the club forum).  White begins with d3, known as the Mieses opening (I had to look that up as I've never seen that opening).  } g6 {I go with my typical defense as Black, The Modern/Robatsch Defense.} 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 d6 {Thus far, pretty typical moves for Black.} 4. c4 c5 {As Black, in The Modern, I often go 4...a6 to set up b5 and queenside expansion.  However, when White strikes out early with c4, a6 doesn't make much sense.  Therefore, I mirror White.} 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Nf3 e6 {I wanted the option to develop my N to either f6 or e7 and therefore moved 6...e6.} 7. O-O Nge7 {7.  Nge7--I think I was trying to reinforce control over f5, d5--particulary as it was possible that I'd move e5 to free up Bc8.} 8. Bg5 h6 {The question is put immediately to white.  If White had exchanged B for N, I would have attempted to open up the board to capitalize on the B-pair--perhaps d5.} 9. Bd2 {White retreats.} O-O 10. Qc1 Kh7 {Protecting h6.} 11. Ne4 {11. Ne4.  I didn't understand the purpose behind this move.  It encouraged me to move f5, gaining space with tempo as the N only had 1 safe square--c3.} f5 12. Nc3 e5 {12...e5  I think with this move I was seeking to gain space on the King side.  It leaves a hole at d5 but Ne7 covered it and I had plans for Be6.} 13. Qd1 Rb8 14. Rc1 Be6 15. Qa4 {15.  Qa4  Looked to me that White had queenside designs (positional chess is not my strength but is something I'm working on).} Qb6 {I figured the Black Queen wasn't doing much on d8 and this could disrupt White's q-side designs.} 16. b3 {I was unclear why 16. b3.  I certainly did not plan on taking b3 with my Queen.} Rf7 {I can't recall my exact reason for this except perhaps to line the Black rooks up on the f-file.} 17. Nd5 {17. Nd5--I did not understand this move as it loses a pawn.} Nxd5 18. cxd5 Bxd5 19. Qh4 {19. Qd4  This move initially concerned me as all I saw was White's Q and DSB bearing down on h6 and White's N ready to jump in and fork Black's K and R.  After a bit I was able to develop a plan.  (as an aside, in my post game review with Fritz, it recommended 19. Ng5+  hxg5 20. Bxd5  This would have changed the game quite a bit as Black would have had to move Rf7 to c7 to avoid being taken and to protect Nc6.)} Bxf3 20. Bxf3 Qd8 {20...Qd8 In hindsight, I came to believe that this was an error on Black's part.  My thought was to chase White's Q away or exchange Q's and try to get to an endgame with the pawn advantage.  However, I believe that 20...Nd4 would have been a better move.  When discussing this with my opponent (after move 20), he indicated had I gone 20...Nd4, he would have moved 21. Kf2, likely to avoid the potential fork.  From Nd4, Black could have exchanged the N for White's LSB, thereby eliminating White's B-pair.  As will be seen, Black had to give back his pawn advantage to break up that pair.} 21. Qxd8 Rxd8 22. e3 Re8 23. Bd5 Rd7 24. f3 Ne7 25. Be6 Rc7 26. e4 Nc6 27. Bd5 {This Bishop does not move again and is a bone in Black's throat for the rest of the game.  Again, move 20...Nd4 and this is not a concern.} Nd4 {The obvious threat is Ne2.  The hope was that White would seek to exchange B for N.} 28. Kg2 b6 29. Be3 Ree7 30. h4 {30. h4.  At this point, I became quite concerned.  White has both Bishops bearing down on the Black King's position.  White is rolling his pawns down toward the Black King and if they open up the position, White's rooks will easily get to the King.  Essentially, my view was that Black had a material advantage (1 pawn) but White had a significant positional advantage.  However, Black saw a way to give back the pawn and impact White's positional advantage.} Ne2 31. Rc2 Nxg3 32. Kxg3 f4+ 33. Bxf4 exf4+ 34. Kxf4 { } Be5+ 35. Kg4 Reg7 36. f4 Bd4 {And white's positional advantage has been pretty significantly minimized.  } 37. a3 b5 {At this point, I did not see how I could break thru White's defenses unless he made an error.  I sought to simply stop any incursion.} 38. Kf3 a5 39. a4 b4 40. Rg2 h5 41. Kg3 Rce7 42. Kh3 Kh6 43. Rc1 {It was here I suggested the draw to White but did not offer it.  I could see no way through and no way the White could break through.  However, I did not formally offer the draw as I am 200 pts south of my opponent's rating and it was quite possible he saw something I did not.} Rec7 44. Kh2 {Here, he agreed with my assessment, offered the draw, and I accepted.  This represents my first draw against a 1900+ opponent.  I don't know that either player made a large error--rather a few smaller errors.  I enjoyed the game and it was a pleasure playing against paolo.  I welcome any comments.}
