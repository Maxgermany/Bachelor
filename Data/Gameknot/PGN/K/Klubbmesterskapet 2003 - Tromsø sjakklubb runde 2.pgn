1. e4 {After playing chess at GK for some few months my interest for chess was really awakened and I decided to join a chess club and see how I liked it. This game is my second full time(90 minutes for the 40 first moves and an additional 30 minutes for the rest of the game) match. The shocking situation for me comes at the 24th move...} c6 2. Nf3 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 e6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Bd2 Nf6 7. Bd3 O-O 8. O-O Nc6 9. a3 Ba5 10. Re1 a6 11. Qb1 Bc7 {Here I realize that white is about to get full control of center} 12. Na4 {I have come to the conclusion that blacks rook will end up at e8 and I will have trouble keeping Nf3, which I dreamt about using in an attack on h7 together with the queen and bishop. I therefore starts the work to replace the attacking force of the f3-knight with the c3-knight....} Re8 {As foreseen!} 13. c4 dxc4 14. Bc2 {Keeping my b1-h7 diagonal} b5 15. Nc5 Nxd4 16. Nxd4 Qxd4 {Losing the f3-knight, as expected.} 17. Ne4 {and the other knight is in center... } Bb6 18. Bc3 Qd8 19. Nxf6+ gxf6 20. Bxh7+ Kg7 21. Qe4 Ra7 {Here I thought that if I manage to get blacks queen to the d7-square I force it off the protection of the f6-pawn and should have a fierce attack. Actually, taking with the queen will force a check mate} 22. Rad1 Rd7 23. Rxd7 {Here I was waiting in excitement. Will he take with bishop or queen.} Qxd7 {And taking with the queen is the losing blunder! The shock to me is the fact that I did see the mating sequence that is now available in 5 moves. Normally I don't have that nice calculation ability... Maybe I had fever this evening?} 24. Qg4+ Kxh7 25. Bxf6 {threatening check mate in 1...} Bxf2+ {And here I was calculating over and over again,with the body shaking :-) Can I play Rh1 and as a result black can't avoid check mate?} 26. Kxf2 {?? Here I should have played Kh1 and out of reach for black. But I didn't trust my nerves and my level of insight in the game and that I maybe have missed some other options for black to swindle me...   26.Kh1 Kh6 27.Qg5+ Kh7 28.Qg7#   } Qd2+ {So now I have to fight on even a pawn down. But still with a strong attack} 27. Re2 Qh6 28. Bg5 Qg6 29. Qh4+ Kg7 30. Re3 Rh8 31. Qd4+ f6 32. Bf4 e5 33. Qa7+ Qf7 34. Rg3+ Kf8 35. Qc5+ Qe7 36. Qxc8+ Qe8 37. Bh6+ {Despite the fact that I missed a forced checkmate earlier in the game I still managed to keep focused to pull off a nice ending of the game. 37...Rxh6 38. Rg8+ and the black queen is lost. 1-0}
