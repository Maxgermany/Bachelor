[Opening "King's Indian, 3.Nf3 (E60)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 {Unlike what we saw with Ken, I'm not transposing or differentiating from the mainlines, yet, this time around since I'm not too used to that defense.  It's later on that I get ready to do that.} 4. g3 {And, Sue is also sticking to the mainlines.} O-O {This, I believe is where I start differentiating.  I don't know what's usually played next after those three lines, but I don't care because it's most certainly not a mistake or inaccuracy.  And, that's what matters as this is how the student learns, as well.  With that being said, I'm, as usual, fixated on castling early since bringing the monarch to safety is something that I enjoy.} 5. Bg2 {But, Sue is sticking to the mainlines, as I also learned from Ken, he differentiated.} d6 {Opening up a line for my Bc8, and thus, developing.  The only thing I'm not doing yet is playing ...Nc3?! because that c pawn hasn't advanced.  And, to set a good example, I'm not deviating from General Opening Guidelines, unless, it's needed.} 6. O-O {Like me, Sue is getting her King to safety.} Bf5 {I considered 6...Bg4 with the idea of putting pressure on her Ng4.  As Ken told me, pressure is about not knowing what to do.  However, I figured out that it could backfired.  That's because she could answer with 7.h3, and then, I'm forced to retreat.  Tempo loss is not a horrible deal.  But, it was something I wanted to avoid for now, in order to complete my development.  Afterall, what happens if she attacks, and I run back.  She could figure out a different attack or play Bg5 against my N.  And, I didn't want that, so another way of saying it is that, by playing this, I'm avoiding pressure as I am not wondering what to do.} 7. Nc3 {Given that her c pawn has advanced (as that's what you do when playing against the KID), it was safe.} Nbd7 {For me, however, it was a different story, as the c pawn didn't advance.  So, I played this, instead, to complete my development.  Might seem like a simple reason, but there's more that goes into this cognition.  That's because I kept something in mind that Ken told me, which you'll see on my next move.  But, that weighed in with my decision to play this.} 8. Bf4 {Completing her development.} Nb6 {But, in the coaching session, where I deemed my N cramped and remembering what Susan Polgar taught me about how to handle it comes something important.  The idea being is that moves had to be discussed before I played them, just like my last unrated game with bhidragon.  And, when discussing it and my take, he said that chess is about finding a better placement for your pieces.  And, that's exactly what happened with this Knight because you don't want it cramped so close to your homesquare.  By that, I mean the first or end two ranks of that area.  Once it goes further up, then it's better placed.} 9. b3 {Getting a solid pawn chain.} Bg4 {Unlike before, I'm not afraid of h3, as I feel that her Nf3 is worth more then my LSB, at this point.  This is where I start calculating more then one variation, and felt that she could, potentially, have more then one threat with the N.  It's not now, but the concern is later on.  For example, what happens, if she's able to play something like Ng5.  And, then I'm a little concerned about her bringing the Queen c2 and then coordinating her DSB.  We could be talking about forces that might weaken my K.  I wouldn't normally be worried except for what I learned with bhidragon because it appears to me that the board was, potentially, telling a big story.  In order to understand, my idea was not taking chances or allowing it.  So, this time, I do have that readiness to exchange, if needed.} 10. e4 {The good news is that an exchange isn't needed, yet, as this was played.} c5 {So, I'm ready to exchange pawns, instead.  I looked at the possibilities of taking on c5 keeping in mind that she can't take back with her Nf3 as it's pinned which was the logic behind 9...Bg4 when thinking about what it could do.  So, what happens, were she to take back with the Queen.  I'd play ...e5.  I didn't think she'd go for that because you're talking about forking Queen and N.  Can be broken but not at the expense of losing a piece.  So, like what you saw in the game chat with Kenneth_fiore_3 when he was going to get my Queen for Rook, I was just as interested in what Sue would play.  It's also based on what Ken outlined that in coaching, you make the position more and more difficult so that the student has to figure out what to do.} 11. Qc1 {? But, she played this, which I later pointed out to be a mistake as this going to win a pawn.} cxd4 12. Nxd4 {?? Not knowing what occurred, she played this.  This, is where the mentoring starts, and what I mentioned is combined with the last move.  This was a blunder. It looks good at appeared that white has gotten something back. But, this move is going to cost more material.  But, 11.Qc1? was a mistake before that as it costed a pawn.  After this, I gave her Homework which went right back to 10...c5.  The question was finding the best move for white, in other words, how white should proceed in the position.  Sue: was it d5?  Joe: d5 is a good move. I was thinking cxd4, and after I take back, black hasn't lost anything. But, d5 also works. In other words, it's just as good.  } e5 13. Bg5 {? Although pinning my Nf6, this was mistake.  I mentioned when the game was over.  Similar to ION, I generally you won't say much in a winning position.  However, this was different as it builds up to overall moral which, I learned with my teacher.  But, in this case, better was 13.Nc2  Although a little cramped, she would've gotten a pawn, in return.  By playing this, it's a free piece.} exd4 14. Nb5 {I calculated what Sue might be trying to do.  I figured that maybe she wanted a pawn.  But, going with more then one thing, as it looked like a potential for multiple threat, that the potential is real.  Her plan is 15.Qg4, for if she does that, my d6 is a target.} Be2 {To keep it safe, I attack her Rook.} 15. Re1 h6 {? This is where I make a mistake of only calculating, not even a variation but one move, which is worse.  As, this should give her a little compensation.  My only reason behind playing this was to break the nasty pin since I knew what I did in the game that I lost.  Afterall, that's what happened in a game.  However, unlike before, what's sinking in is that I didn't consider if it worked, in this position.  The idea is on top of combining it with a game, the position, in itself, is critical.  I'm lucky that Sue didn't spot it but am upset with myself because a more experienced player would've compensated, when the idea is not giving the student a chance to compensate as Ken once emphasized before our training game.  } 16. Bf4 {She, played this, instead.  And, I made a mistake in my comment that had to make things wait until the last move.  As I said, that I was thinking about that pin too much and trying to break. But, there are multiple variations that go into it. With that being said, even though you're behind, slightly better was 16.Rxe2, as it regains a pawn. As then, I'd continue with 16...d3, after which you can quick play 17.Rd2 with 17...hxg5 18.Rxd3 to follow. } d3 {Trying to prevent her from getting the pawn and, similar to Edna's last annotation, being fixated on that passed pawn, I played this.  The difference is that I calculated more then one variation, but the problem is that, in that extra calculation, I overlooked something important.  What kept in mind was that pawn, plus, it doesn't appear that white can get a pawn, anymore.  So, another variation that I looked at was 17.Bxd6, with the idea being 17...Qxd6  What I had overlooked, and thus, wouldn't have played was 17...Qxd6?? because of where her Knight is placed.  That's right, we're talking about Nb5.  But, that's bad as she can still win my pawn.} 17. Qd2 {Sue, however, overlooked that and played this to stop my passed pawn.  What she didn't realize is that, even if I wanted, that pawn couldn't advance.  One variation that I didn't mention on the 16th degree (when playing 16...d3) was 16...d2?? which considered.  As I thought about forking her Queen and Rook.  It, however, is ineffective, for had I done that, she would've, for one thing, gotten a pawn back with Qxd2.  Although she had a chance to do something like that before, this would've been worse as, not only don't you promote, but the threat is winding up ahead now, since my Be2 would be en-prise.  I'd see that, but at the cost of protecting, I'd lose tempo which is something that you don't want here.  After which, then she might pick up another pawn with d6 which would've almost equal.  And, I wasn't going to allow that.  But, with this move, I keep that pawn safe.} Ne8 {As now, there's coverage with my N.  On top of that, Sue's faced with a discovered attack on her Ra1.} 18. Be3 {?? To my surprise, however, Sue overlooked that.  However, I wouldn't have been, if she played 18.Bf3 with the idea of getting a Bishop in return, as that was the first variation I thought of because, either way, she gets a Bishop in return.  But, it's still a loss of more material, and thus, not enough compensation.  The second thing I looked at, however, is what I thought she'd do of protecting her Ra8.} Bxa1 19. Rxa1 Qf6 {I considered 19...h6 with the of protecting my pawn, at once.  But, I decided that it was worth looking at this which got played with the idea of attacking her.  Like before, my anticipation was protecting.  What I considered, however, was the second variation which she played.  That's because I kept in mind that I instead of protecting it, I can let her have it with this.  I, however, didn't think she'd take.  I believe that she was thinking along the lines of this because once she took, it didn't appear that I could get a free Rook since my Rf8 was a target.  What she missed, however, is that, when I took it was a check, and mate would be threatened.  With that being said, this is going to cost her the other Rook.  Unlike before, this will be without compensation because of what I outlined with her being in check.} 20. Bxh6 Qxa1+ 21. Bf1 {?? This is her final blunder, and I said something here.  Which was, Although in trouble, this move leads to mate. In this position, 21.Qc1 was the only move that holds white in longer. And, then comes 21...Qxc1, 22.Qxc1 It is liquidation while far behind which is problematic. But, it does, however, prevent an immediate mate. } Qxf1# {After this game, I gave her moral.  But, in order to do so, I decided to point out all the errors, so that Sue would learn what it all boiled down to, since it happened shortly after understanding what went wrong in my rated game against bhidragon.  Therefore, what I told Sue boils down to the moral of this game.  So, I messaged her and said, You played very well, in the beginning of the KID. But, on the Queen should've stayed on d1. That's because 11.Qc1? was the first mistake as it enabled me to win a pawn. Then, you took back with 12.Nxd4?? which enabled me to fork your B and N. Better was to retreat the N, as you would've gotten a pawn for piece. But, you pinned the N, which got a free piece. Later on, there was a discovered attack against your Rook. But, I think you were concerned about me hitting the B, so the move was 18.Be3 which enabled me to get a Rook for Bishop. After that, was taking the pawn and threatening the Rook but then I took the other Rook with check. Last, the B, as opposed to the Q, came up which ended in mate. I would say that the overall lesson to learn here is something that one of my mentors recently taught me, which I used to defeat Ted in the most recent annotation. It's to see the overall picture (entire story) that the board is telling you. In other words, don't get fixated on one or two details (or as the saying goes, "don't cry over spilt milk" But, look at all of the details that happen on the board, as then, you can focus on what's really important.}
