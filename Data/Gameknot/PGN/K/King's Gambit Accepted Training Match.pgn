1. e4 {This game is one I should have lost, probably twice.  I was fortunate to escape with a draw as I played poorly.  There are a lot of good things to take out of our mistakes in the game.  Appreciate your comments and suggestions for improved play.} e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 {To help protect the f pawn as well as allow options for harassing my knight.} 4. h4 {Although this is the book play for KGA, I almost never play it.  I prefer Bc4 to help develop my attacks more quickly.  Since this was an unrated training game I decided to give it a go.} g4 {Continuing with the attack} 5. Ne5 {This move is better than Ng5, because it centralizes the knight and threatens the g pawn.} Nh6 {I would prefer Nf6 because it simultaneously threatens the e pawn and a knight on the side of the board is normally less useful than a knight in the middle.} 6. Nxg4 {Regaining pawn parity.} Nxg4 {Another option is d6} 7. Qxg4 Bh6 {I think either Nc6 or d6 would be better} 8. d4 {Nc3 would have been much better... even d3 would have probably been better.  } d6 {I still think it's better to bring the knight out.  Getting your power pieces in play early are important to allow you to quickly respond to advanced threats.} 9. Qf3 {Qh5 (followed by 9.... Bg7, 10. c3) was a much stronger play, keeping the pressure on Black and forcing a bishop move and helping me dictate moves.  If you ever find yourself retreating early in a KGA, then you have made a poor choice leading up to or in the move at hand.  Gambits are about exchanging pieces for fast development and attacks.  I took a timid approach and some future compounding errors will severely impact my position.} Qf6 {Good positional play for black.} 10. c3 {ugh... this was one of those moves that I made and instantly regretted.  While it does help shore up the central pawns, it cedes all initiative to Black.  Instead of dictating the flow (as White should in KGA) I am now reactive.  Nc3, and giving up the d pawn, would have been better.} Rg8 {Good development by Black, bringing extra pressure on my kingside.} 11. e5 {Instead of playing pawn games, I should have brought my knight into the game either at Na3 or Nd2.  Black has the ability to reach deep into my territory with a rook at g3, so I need more pieces for defensive and counterattack options.  Rookie tip: if you're ever uncertain what to do, and you still have power pieces in their starting positions, get them in the game.  As a potential side benefit moving my knight would have potentially given me a chance to castle queenside and connect my rooks.  I can already feel this game slipping away.} dxe5 12. Qe4 {Getting some positional leverage for my queen and preventing the e pawn from capturing my d pawn.} Rg7 {I'm assuming Black did this to protect his h pawn.  It's an acceptable sacrifice at this point.  If Black can get some more of his pieces in play, he can seriously give me the run around.  Get that knight and bishop going!} 13. Bb5+ {I should have taken dxe5 and have no justifiable reason not to.  The LSB was doing me some good at f1.} Nc6 {Probably blocking with a pawn or a bishop was better.} 14. Bxc6+ {Again, how did I not do dxe5?!?!  It would of allowed me to exchange queens and stave off some significant threats against my exposed kingside.  Now my g pawn is going to be a spoil of war in the not too distant future.  I am embarrassed by how badly I'm playing here.  :(} bxc6 {Probably better to take with the queen and offer the trade.} 15. O-O {Probably one of the least intelligent moves I've made thus far, and I've had a few to choose from.  Again, dxe5 is vastly superior.  I've now compromised my position even further.  I am fairly convinced I am going to lose this game after I make this play.  Another indefensible choice.} Bh3 {Perfect response by Black, bringing the heat.} 16. Rf2 {Can White ever see dxe5?  When you bring significant pressure against someone, as Black is doing, your opponents sometimes blink.  I'm blinking hard here.  The end is drawing near.} O-O-O {Great play, allowing for the inevitable rook battery to make my life hell and force me to start shedding material.  Black is in complete control.} 17. Nd2 {Finally White decides to get some of his remaining pieces into the game.} Rdg8 {White is close to dying.} 18. Kf1 {At this point I was looking at losing a piece and going down 4 points.  About every which way I sliced it I'm losing a piece here, so I decided to take a gamble instead of playing the safer Nf3.} Rg7xg2 {Charge!} 19. Nf3 {This move is better than immediately retaking in my book, since that allows Black to get another piece down the board for free.  Don't give away moves if you can help it.} Rxf2+ {I was expecting Black to start putting the final nail in the coffin by playing Qg7 here.  The triple battery would have allowed a stronger blow against White's anemically poor position and sealed my fate.  This move is a mistake and is the beginning of allowing White to crawl back into the game.} 20. Kxf2 Rg2+ {On the surface this move appears fundamentally sound, and it isn't a game breaker, but it is a blunder: Qg7 would have been far stronger.  By bringing the queen into position (of which I can do nothing about except shed material) I am still dead and dying.  This move still preserves the threat of pain and White's position is still lost, but it just isn't as powerful or quick as Qg7 would have allowed.} 21. Ke1 {The only move worth considering...} Rg3 {Now Black is taking his eyes off the prize.  Either Qe6 or Qg7 would have been stronger and would have eventually allowed Black to force me to cough up the knight.} 22. dxe5 {At long last White finally makes the center pawn capture.} Qe6 {Good position for Black's queen.  I am still going to lose more material and likely the game.  Although Black squandered a super strong position, he's still got plenty of pop to make me bleed.} 23. Bxf4 {Finally getting my DSB into the game.  Better late than never...} Bxf4 {Blunder!  f5 would have won the piece.} 24. Qxf4 {Unbelievably I have managed to salvage a completely lost position to at least equal in points.  As I don't have my rook in the game yet, Black still has a tremendous positional advantage, but White isn't dead yet!} Qg6 {Looking to trade a rook for a knight and a rook.} 25. Rd1 {Taking away the trade value.} Bg2 {Blunder!  Black should have brought his queen to Qg4 to force the trade and would have been in prime position to win the knight.  White is now able to turn the tide.} 26. Ng5 Rd3 {The only option worth considering...} 27. Qg4+ {I also considered Rxd3, and perhaps I should have, but I wanted the extra pieces for maneuverability.  } Kb7 28. Qxg2 Re3+ {It might have been better for Black to trade rooks here and allow a free queen in the backfield.} 29. Kd2 {I also considered Kf1 and now consider that a better play, but I wanted to be able to get a queen/rook battery.} Rxe5 {h6 was probably a better play or forcing a rook trade...} 30. Rg1 {A problem for me.  h6 gets a knight for pawn exchange.  Qh1 is the better play to break the pin.} Qh6 {Looking to make the pawn/knight exchange via pin (better to play h6 and just get it)} 31. Kc2 {Breaking the pin} Qh5 {I expected Black to trade pawns here via 31... Qxh4, 32: Nxf7.  Instead Black is trying for the rook split of my king/queen.} 32. Qg4 {Getting rid of the exchange option.} Qg6+ {Gaining free positional placement via tempo.} 33. Kc1 Rf5 34. Ne4 {Blunder!  Instead of a nice end game advantage I gave away the rook and forced a draw.  Qb4+ gives me an escape root for the queen and allows a stronger finish, a path to trade queens.  This is the final blunder in a series of blunders that allows Black to snatch a draw from the mouth of defeat.} Rf1+ {Great play by Black!  Note that this move effectively wins the rook and were it not for my ability to force perpetual check would have cost me the game.  Excuses?  None valid!  } 35. Kd2 Rxg1 36. Nc5+ Kb8 {Another other move is mate.} 37. Na6+ Kb7 38. Nc5+ Kb8 39. Na6+ {And thus ends the sad chapter on this little game.  A few key lessons:  1) KGA - if you're White, it's still early, and you're retreating, you've done something wrong.  Look for ways to extend the attack! 2) When in doubt, get your pieces into play.  Don't play pawn games when you need that extra power for attack/defense.  Finish that development. 3) When you have your opponent on the ropes, don't immediately recapture.  Look at your options and see if there's another way to add even more pressure. 4) And finally, queens make for a hairy endgame that can be tough to predict.  If you're  ahead, consider trading them away to have more predictable end games.  If they are out of power pieces, their ability to mount a comeback and few and far between.  In sum I made a lot of mistakes early, Black almost capitalized and let me claw back, and then I made a key blunder late in the game that robbed me of my shot at victory and by all rights should have cost me the game.  Not worthy of the rating in this game!  Well done, madcsan.}
