1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {  Kasparov switches from his usual Najorf. Which was dealt harsly by  Anand in game 9. This is the first game which Kasparov played Sicilian Dragon in a serious game, and Anand was taken by a real  suprise to see the Dragon from Kasparov.} 6. Be3 { 6. f4 is the Levenfish which immediately threatens 7.e5.  Black will have to play 6.Nc6, if 6. Bg7?  7.e5!} Bg7 { 6. Ng4??  is a horrible mistake because of 7.Bb5 !  which shall win the Knight after 7. Bd7 then 8. Qxg4 wins it. Note that Black can't capture the Queen with the Bishop because it is pinned to the Black King by the Bishop on b5.} 7. f3 { To stop 8.Ng4 after Black plays 7. 0-0} O-O { Black brings his King to safety.} 8. Qd2 { This is known as the Yugoslav attack which is most popular way to meet the Dragon. The Bishop plans to come to c4 and castle Q-side and later drop the Bishop to b3 and then a pawn storm on the King side that is the general strategy for White.} Nc6 {However Black's strategy is to bring the Bishop to d7. ( If the White Bishop comes to e2 known as the classical system then Black should exchange Knights and then play Be6!  yes to e6.)  Then play Rc8 and then bring the Queen out to a5 and then go for Ne5-c4 then later on a possible exchange sacrifice with Rxc3. and h5 to stop White from playing h2-h4-h5 and g4.} 9. Bc4 { Development.....} Bd7 { Now the Bishop is not on c8 the parking space is now reserved for the Rook ( the a8 rook).} 10. O-O-O { 10.0-0 is an alternative.} Ne5 { This  threatens the b3 Bishop.} 11. Bb3 { This is where the Bishop should retreat because itis on the right diagonal giving cover to the King and  also has in eye Black's King!} Rc8 { The cannon is ready!  Ready to support the Knight when it goes to c4!} 12. h4 { White is now launcing  a King-side attack that MUST be stopped. If Black does not prevent it he will most probably get burnt to the ground.} h5 {Preventing White from playing 13. h5. failure to play 12.h5 for Black  could lead to a getting hammered down the h-file.} 13. Kb1 { Anand decides to play it safe. The sharp way to play is 13. Bg5 then 13.Rc5  14. g4!? hxg4 15. f4 Nc4 which is very bizzar.} Nc4 { This move threatens the Queen and blocks the b3 bishop. } 14. Bxc4 { Forced. If Queen retreats then Black will exchange the Knight for the powerful Bishop on e3.} Rxc4 { Recapture.....} 15. Nde2 {If White played 15. Bh6 then Black can win a Knight and a B. ishop for a Rook after 15.Rxd4! 16.Qxd4 and then 16.Bxh6 which will favor Black.} b5 { Black supports his Rook and this moves shows his willingness to start up a Queenside attack. I recommend 15. Re8 though because when White plays (and what he did in da game) 16.Bh6   Black can keep the powerful and also the King's defender by playing 16. Bh8.} 16. Bh6 Qa5 { This moves allows the Rook on f8 to go to c8 and double up.} 17. Bxg7 Kxg7 { With the dark squared Bishop gone, Kasparov's Queen-side attack prospects will be reduced,  a lot.  On the other hand Black's position is fairly solid. White must avoid, at all costs!  17. Nd5??  Qxd2  18. Nxe7  Kh7 19. Bxd2 then 19.Re8 20. Nd5 Nxd5 wins a piece because of the pin.  ( Palatnik).} 18. Nf4 {Another Knight glares at the d5 square.} Rfc8 19. Ncd5 {White has a slight advantage.} Qxd2 {Black's Queen was hanging so Kasparov exchanged Queens.} 20. Rxd2 { Recapture.} Nxd5 21. Nxd5 Kf8 { The e7 pawn was hanging. The King now supports the pawn.} 22. Re1 { To discourage Black from playing 22.f5} Rb8 { Not a good idea. 22. R4c5! prepares 23.a5. However 22. a5?? played right away loses the exchange due to 23. Nb6 and both the Rooks are forked by the Knight.} 23. b3 {White is slowly improving his position.} Rc5 { } 24. Nf4 { An odd move, because the Knight was very well placed on d5. Better was the natural 24. Kb2 and 24.a5 is met by 25.a3.} Rbc8 {The Rook comes back again!} 25. Kb2 { Natural because White is almost meeting the endgame.} a5 { The pawn rushes forward.} 26. a3 { To stop Black playing 26.b4} Kg7 27. Nd5 {White should have played 27. Re3 f6 28.c3 Kf7 29. Rd1  White can then play b3-b4 making Black's b-pawn a forever target and at the right time create a passed pawn on the Queenside.} Be6 { !   This sets a trap!} 28. b4 { ?  Kasparov said he expected to see 28. Nxe7  Re8 29. Nd5 Bxd5 30. b4 axb4 31. axb4 Rc4 32. Rxd5 Rxb4  ( Not 32. Rec8? 33. c3 Rxc3 34. Re2)   33. Kc1 f5  which leads to a drawn position.} axb4 29. axb4 { ?   Anand has lost all his sense of danger- a very foolish attitude towards a brilliant tactician as Kasparov!   29. Nxb4, was necessary but Black would be in the driving seat.} Rc5c4 { When I first looked at this bit I thought White has 30. Nb6 forking both Rooks and winning the exchange. I did not see far enough as soon as I saw 30. Nb6 I thought right thats it and I followed the rest of the game through.} 30. Nb6 { Exacly what I thought would happen.} Rxb4+ 31. Ka3 { Anand has assumed that Kasparov  has blundered. But instead                      ANAND WALKED STRAIGHT INTO OBLIVION!!!!!!!!!!!} Rxc2 { !!!!      This move probably struck like lightning and wins on da spot!!       After 32. Rxc2 Rb3  33. Ka2  Re3  34. Kb2 Rxe1.  Seeing all of this Anand   resigned immediately. It was only a few moves ago when of which Anand tried to push with a slight advantage;  this very sudden and nasty twist of fate must have had a very, very depressing effect on Anand.   Anyway    Good game!!!    I enjoyed it and I hope you all enjoyed it too   Thanks for watching I will send in another soon.}
