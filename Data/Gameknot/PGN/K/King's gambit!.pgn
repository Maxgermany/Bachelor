[Opening "KGA (C34), Becker defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 {In opening like Spanish white lays siege on blacks e5 pawn slowly, over a large number of moves, but in KG white starts a storm by attacking it right away. This was a popular opening back in time and many great master used to play this aggressive opening. It could be stated as matter of honor to accept the gambit pawn.} exf4 {Here my opponent Wildcat said that he once read that the only way to refute gambit is to accept it! I agree, that this the best move by black. Declining the gambit usually lets white to keep atleast a small advantage in my opinion quite easily. Falkbeer Counter-Gambit(2...e5) is the interesting play by black and those who want to play KG should look for ways to deal with it. } 3. Nf3 {I mainly encourage KG players to play this Knight Gambit(3.Nf3) instead of playing Bishop Gambit(3. Bc4). I vary lot between these two in blitz games but I just find it hard to find place for 3.Bc4 in longer games. Knight Gambit prepares to seize the center and keeps the nasty Qh4 check out. } h6 {Becker Defence. It seems that black wants to hold his f-pawn by playing move 3...h6 and same idea can be seen in some other KG variations(in Becker black just doesn't need to keep the same weaknesses). White usually decides to play move like h4 to undermine blacks pawn chain on kingside. } 4. d4 {Here white has alternative 4.b3 with idea to stop black from playing ...g5. If you want to vary with your opening then you should give some time analysing 4.b3 aswell. Classical play is to go for 4.Bc4 g5 which is not my personal favourite but you can play it(note that 5.Ne5 doesn't cause any harm as black just play 5....Rh7! in Classical). } g5 5. Nc3 {In here, I just say that you should play this knight move developing a piece and knight belongs here. 5.h4 is just not good idea as after 5...Bg7 I don't know what white is about to do. Lets say: 6.g3(just a try) g4 7.Ne5 d6 8.Nxf7 Kxf7 9.Bc4+ Ke8 10.gxf4 is not that good for white. } d6 {So in here 5...Bb4 idea doesn't work for black 6.h4 g4 7.Ne5 d6 8.Nxg4, white is better. 5...g4 and white does alright after 6.Bxf4 gxf3 7. hxg3 d6 8.0-0-0 knight is sacrificed for lead in development and good position. So if black goes for 5...Bg7(good alternative to ...d6) 6.g3 fxg3 7.hxg3 d6 then you can either go for 8.Bc4 recommended by Joe Gallagher in his book or then go for my move 8.Qd3 as after 8...Nf6 9.Be2 0-0 white can play 10.Nxg5 hxg5 11.Bxg5 Re8 12.0-0-0 with good position. } 6. g3 {White has to do something about blacks pawn chain so this move is logical creating counterplay. } Bg7 {I would say that this is the critical move here. 6...g4 fails and it is against Beckers idea to hold kingside with 3...h3. Example: 6...g4 7.Ng1(even 7.Bxf4 is possible with strong attack arising after 7...gxf3 8.Qxf3 Nc6 9.0-0-0) 7...f3 8.h3 is good for white. After 6...fxg3 we can follow the game Fedorov - Notkin, 7.hxg3 Bg7 8.Bc4 Nc6 9.Be3 Bg4 10.0-0 Nf6 11.Qd3 0-0 12.Nxg5 hxg5 13.Bxg5 Nb4 14.Qd2 and white should be doing ok(Fedorov won that game). But I have also encountered someone saying that in here engine would prefer 6...a6?! which looks bad... as white gets strong attack again after 7. gxf4 g4 8.Be3 gxf3 9.Qxf3 Nf6 10.Rg1 Nc6 11.0-0-0 and white is better.} 7. gxf4 g4 { } 8. Be3 {Some alternative would be 8. Rg1. I have played the move 8.Ng1 mostly(Gallagher mentions only that move in his book) but there are some problems so lets take a look: 8.Ng1 Qh4+ 9.Ke2 and now Gallagher mentions only the move 9...g3 when 10.Nf3 Bg4 11.Be3 gxh2(11. ..Nc6 12.Kd2 Qh5 13.Be2 g2 14.Rg1 Qh3 15.d5 Nce7 16.Nd4) 12.Kd2 Qg3 13.Be2 Nc6 14.Nxh2 better for white. I say this needs to be updated though as black can just play 9...Nc6 and remain better for example: 10.Be3 Bd7 11.d5 Nce7 12.Bd4 Rh7! 13.Bxg7 Rxg7 14.Qd4 Nf6 15.Bg2 Ng6 and black is better. } gxf3 9. Qxf3 h5 {Wanting to put bishop on g4. } 10. h3 {Covers g4 } f5 {Lets take a look at other examples so to find out why this is reasonable choice: 10...Bh6 11.0-0-0 Ne7 12.Rg1 is good for white. 10...c5 11.0-0-0 cxd4 12. Bxd4 Bxd4 13.Rxd4 Nc6 14.Rd2 Rh6 15.f5 a6 16.Qf4 Ne5 17.Be2 is also good for white. 10...c6 11.0-0-0 b5 12.Rg1 Bh6 13.a3 a5 14.d5 b4 15.dxc6 bxc3 16.Bb5 cxb2+ 17.Kxb2 again good for white. So 10...f5 is a good try to fight against strong center of white.} 11. e5 {This push gains space and taking the pawn would be suicidal. } Ne7 12. Rg1 {Rook belongs to here. } Rh7 {Protecting bishop and 12...Rg8? is a mistake as it leaves h-pawn without protection. Black has a bit cramped position here. } 13. O-O-O d5 {! The best move in this position by black. Keeping any d4-d5 plans away and trying to delay whites attacking plans. } 14. Bf2 {This is really important move here. It might look that white has other plans aswell but they just fail to create nothing more than drawn positions. I am not going to put here a wall of text from my analysis as it would be huge mess and I really mean it. This is also logical move(14.Bf7) and not hard to find as the idea is to place it on better square h4. } Be6 { } 15. Bh4 Bf8 {? Black should have played 15...c6! by all means. Black is already in that passive position that he should try to stone whites attack and c6 would keep any plans towards d5-pawn away right away.} 16. Rg6 Qd7 {Now we are going to see why ...c6 would have been a good move. White has now tactical solution to get advantage in this game so lets take a look. } 17. Rxe6 Qxe6 18. Bxe7 Kxe7 19. Nxd5+ {And boom! Now there was nothing protecting this pawn. Black also has to give his b7-pawn away now. } Kd8 20. Nf6 Rg7 21. Qxb7 Qc6 {Okay, lets stop here. White needs a plan now and it is his pawns. The plan is to use them and try to win this game. In here white should not trade queens away just yet atleast. Black doesn't have his king in safety like white does so it is more likely that white queen is going to cause more troubles for black than black queen is going to cause for white. } 22. Qb3 Nd7 {? Now this is a clear mistake which throws the game. I was waiting for the move 22...Be7 and after 23.Bb5 Qb7 24.Qd3 white would remain better but black has better chances to hold the draw. } 23. Bb5 {Maybe Wildcat missed this move. } Qb7 24. Nxd7 { } Rxd7 25. Qg8 c6 {Black had to make some breathing space for king. } 26. d5 {In this kind of positions you have to be exact. One bad move and it is over or you throw the win away like there was small possibility here. 26.Qxf8+? is one of that type so lets take a look why: 26.Qxf8+? Kc7 27.Bxc6 Qxc6 28.Qxf5 Rad8 29.e6 Rxd4 30. Qe5+ R4d6 31.e7 Re8 32.f5 Kd7 33.Qe6+ Kc7 34.Qe5 Kd7 and it is drawn. But I didn't make that move due that and I found that after the game. I simply saw that this move forces black to take and I can bring check on c5 now without queen blocking it forcing black king to move on same time and restricting movement of his army. It was also clear that if king moves to d8 after the check that I could use my pawns to win material. } cxb5 { } 27. Qxf8+ Kc7 28. Qc5+ Kb8 {This was interesting creating place for rook on c7 and block the check from f8 with a rook. Not saving the game but 28...Kd8 29.e6 Qb6 30.Qf8+ Kc7 31. Qxa8 Rd8 32.Qc6+ Qxc6 33.dxc6 is just simply lost.} 29. e6 Rc7 30. Qf8+ Rc8 31. Qxf5 {This pawn just had to be taken. } Qb6 32. Qe5+ Kb7 {32...Qc7 is lost after 33.Qxc7+ Rxc7 34.d6 } 33. d6 {One step closer to its destination. When you have a plan then you keep going for it step by step where every step values more. Ok, it also keeps black king on the side being a disease. } Rcg8 { } 34. e7 Rg1 {Black tries his last idea to do something. } 35. Qd5+ {This had to be done or otherwise black might find a way to win a rook by getting it out of protection.  } Ka6 36. c3 {King needs safeheaven and now it is on b3. } Rb8 37. d7 Qe3+ 38. Kc2 {Now we see why queen was needed to protect rook as here ...Qe2 check would be terrible otherwise. } Rxd1 {This was basically just hoping for mistake as there is only one move for white to win the game. } 39. Kxd1 {Every other move would have thrown the game away. } Qxe7 40. Qc6+ {Black resigns as 40...Rb6 41.Qc8+ Rb7 42.d8Q Qxd8+ 43.Qxd8 is just easy win for white and 40...Ka5 leads into checkmate after 41.b4+. Black should have gone for 15...c6! earlier in the game as 15...Bf8? was a clear mistake leading into troubles. I would like to thank Wildcat for accepting to play King's Gambit for training purposes and hopefully others find this as a good teaching game(especially Mikey who I played this game for).}
