1. e4 {Kings Gambit, an interesting winning attack although White could have won more quickly.} e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4 6. O-O O-O 7. e5 {White decides to go for the attack.} Ng4 8. Nd5 Bc5+ {Not the best move, better was Ba5 because the Bishop can be driven back with tempo.} 9. d4 Bb6 10. Bxf4 d6 11. Nxb6 {White decides to eliminate the DSB and weaken the pawns.} axb6 12. exd6 cxd6 13. h3 Nf6 14. d5 Nb4 15. a3 Na6 16. Bg5 {A key provoking move, Black's missing DSB would have been useful here.} h6 17. Bh4 g5 {?? While Black would like to drive off the pin, this leaves the kingside too weak.} 18. Nxg5 {! Black is now exposed to a withering attack. Of course, taking the N loses the pinned Nf6.} b5 {!? Nice try} 19. Bd3 {Safest to decline the pawn and go for the King.} Qb6+ 20. Kh2 {?! Imprecise. Better to keep the K off the dark squares to avoid checks.} hxg5 21. Rxf6 {! The point. Black can't take the Bishop due to the mate threat.} Qe3 {! Nice try, exploiting White's King being on the dark squares.} 22. Rf3 {If the K had been on h1, Qh5 would have been finito, but Black can check on e5.} Qe7 23. Bxg5 {The bishop is immune due to the pin.} f6 24. Bh6 Rf7 25. Rg3+ Kh8 26. Qh5 {Now Qh5 is crushing, Black resigns.}
