1. a3 {This opening really made me question my opponent's abilities. Nonetheless, I was cautious.} d5 2. d3 {Very passive. I still thought white had something planned, though.} e5 3. Bd2 Nc6 4. Be3 {Now that I saw that my opponent moved the same piece twice in a row, whilst blocking the advance of his central pawn, I was almost sure I had this game in the bag.} d4 5. g4 {This guy was the perfect example of how NOT to play chess.} dxe3 6. fxe3 Qh4+ {It was a shame that the d2 square was vacated.} 7. Kd2 {Forced} Bxg4 8. a4 O-O-O 9. Bg2 Qf6 10. h3 Bf5 11. Nf3 e4 {I now struck at my opponent's weaknesses.} 12. Ra3 {!?} Bxa3 13. bxa3 exf3 14. Bxf3 Nge7 {By the completion of my development, my opponent was already in shambles, even with his pawn structure.} 15. e4 Be6 16. Kc1 Ba2 17. Nd2 {Now I would win the knight.} Qa1+ 18. Nb1 {Forced} Qxb1+ 19. Kd2 {Forced} Qxd1+ 20. Rxd1 Be6 21. d4 {He now makes it easier to get at the king!} Rxd4+ {All White's pawns were now isolated.} 22. Kc1 Rxd1+ 23. Kxd1 Rd8+ 24. Ke1 Nd4 25. Bg2 {White may be better to keep his bishop than his queenside pawns, not that it would have helped.} Nxc2+ 26. Kf1 Ne3+ 27. Kf2 Nxg2 28. Kxg2 f5 29. h4 {Not even gonna take that pawn? I had enough of this guy.} fxe4 30. e3 Rd3 31. Kf2 c5 32. h5 c4 33. Ke2 c3 34. a5 {My pawn marched to promotion as White did nothing. He only cared about pushing pawns, not running the king away.} c2 35. a4 c1=Q 36. a6 Qc2+ {And now I'm ready to win my first rated game.} 37. Ke1 Rd1# {This was a great start to the 2008/2009 chess season. What new opponents did I hope to take on next? Thanks for watching. }
