1. e4 {The white king sends out a foot soldier.} e5 {Monkey see, monkey do.} 2. f4 {White plays the Kings Gambit.} exf4 {Black accepts the offer and takes a pawn.} 3. Bc4 {White continues to develop.} Nf6 {Black continues to develop and threatens the white pawn on e4. } 4. d3 {White protects his pawn and now threatens the black pawn on f4.} d5 {Black ignores the threat on his pawn and threatens the white bishop.} 5. exd5 {White neutralizes the threat on his bishop and we are now back to even on points.} Nxd5 {Black notices that the white pawn is vulnerable and he executes the capture.  As a side effect, this move also protects the black pawn on f4.  Perhaps this is one of the key moves in the game. Perhaps this is the start of the downfall for white.} 6. Nf3 {White develops a horse.  This keeps the black pawn on f4 from advancing any further just in case that pawn takes a notion to do so.} Qe7+ {The black queen decides that it is time to enter the fray.  She puts the white king in check.} 7. Kf2 {The white King begins taking a long walk in the park.  You are not going to believe where this guy eventually ends up when the game is done. Stay tuned for that.} Ne3 {The black horse is chomping at the bit.   He charges forward to threaten the white queen.} 8. Qd2 {White could have taken the horse with the bishop but decides against it.  Instead the white queen steps out of danger. This might be one of the moves that leads to the downfall for white.  It is not a horrendous blunder, but I think there were probably better moves that white could have made.} Bg4 {Black is starting to taste blood in the water.  The black bishop joins the fight.  } 9. Nc3 {White decides there is no reason to panic, and so he simply develops another horse.} Bxf3 {Black thinks it is time to start clearing the forest. Black trades bishop for horse.} 10. Kxf3 {Rather than making the trade with a pawn, the white king continues his walk in the park.} Qg5 {The black queen would love to check the vulnerable white king, but there is no convenient way to do so.  The black queen advances to a square that may be a good launching pad for an attack.} 11. Re1 {The white rook makes a move and this pins the black horse down.  At this point the black horse can not move even if it wants to.  However, the black horse does not really mind at all.  It is not likely that the white queen nor the white rook would take the black horse.} Qg4+ {As expected, the black queen attacks the white king. It is starting to look bad for white.} 12. Ke4 {The white king continues his walk in the park.  Step by step he is walking away from all of his protectors.} f5+ {This little black pawn feels that he can be of service, so he joins the fight and checks the white king once again.} 13. Ke5 {The white king continues his walk.  I truly don't think I have ever seen a king in a position like that.  It is very unusual.  There is danger in every direction for the white king. He has no protection at all. He must be the stupidest king in the world.} Bd6+ {Black brings out more firepower and checks the white king mercilessly. } 14. Ke6 {If you thought the last location for the white king was unusual, just have a look at this.  It is the strangest thing I have ever seen in my life.  It looks like the white king wants to say hello to the black king.} Qg6# {The black queen puts the white king out of his misery.   It was a short game and a very unusual one.  I was able to beat a player who was rated 150 points higher than me.  It is a proud day.}
