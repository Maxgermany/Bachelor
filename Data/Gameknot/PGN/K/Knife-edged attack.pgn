[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 b6 3. Bf4 {My favourite.} Bb7 4. Nbd2 Nf6 5. e3 {Here, as black, I would have gone for my dsb with Nh5.} c5 6. c3 {This scheme provides me with nice settings, much less "attacheable" than c4 ones. } Nc6 7. h3 {I've seen my opponen is not fond with the Nh5 idea, but this is not to provide my bishop of a square to hide as to prepare a pawn storm. } Be7 8. g4 O-O {Thank you, just where I wanted you to be. } 9. Rg1 {This is to unpin the f3 knight and to prepare h4.} cxd4 10. exd4 {My queenside keeps closed. It is supposed to be the shield for my king, after o-o-o.} Rc8 {Good, preventing Qc2 (Nb4)} 11. h4 {Just wait for me... :-)} Nd5 12. Bh2 {A little trap.} Bxh4 {He falls in it. This just helps me, opening the h column. } 13. Bd6 {...but this move was too juicy to delay. } Re8 {Now, the trap clicks.} 14. g5 {He cannot save the bishop, but my king is becoming very exposed, and castling appears very far. } Ne3 {Nice attempt. } 15. Qb1 {It was important for me to keep the queen active, and I needed it looking to h7.} Nxf1 16. Kxf1 {Not with the rook, and not with the knight, because of Nf3 needs protection. This also keeps my king out of the Re8's action (as black, I would have played e5, probably). } Ba6+ {I considered to shield with c4, but I didn't like b5.} 17. Ke1 {Well, back to the e column. I thought that now e5 was almost the only black chance. } Bxf2+ 18. Kxf2 {Well, THIS is an exposed king. I am lucky the Bd6 is untouchable, and cramps him a lot. } f6 {No, the f column should not be opened!} 19. Rh1 g6 {I thought Rxh7, and if KxR, Qh1+, followed by Qh6. But I wasn't sure it was enough. } 20. Ne4 {Bringing more firepower to the enemy's field. } fxg5 21. Nexg5 {He can now attack the f column, but without much effect. } Re7 {Intelligent. Returning the exchange in order to free his position. Now I have to be very "os√©", if I want to keep my attack. } 22. Nxh7 {The Nf6+ threat is very dangerous for black. His best answer is Rg7, IMO. } Rxh7 {But he went greedy, and this is almost mortal. I could have gone RxR, KxR, Qh1+, but after Kg7 I couldn't see a clear win. } 23. Qxg6+ {My queen returns! ...at the cost of a piece, but the presence of the First Lady into the king whorts it. } Rg7 24. Qh5 {Qh8+ is not checkmate, though. } Qe8 25. Qh8+ Kf7 {Again, I have to play very strong to make my attack successful. } 26. Ng5+ {The nice one. Tempo is all in chess. } Rxg5 27. Rh7+ Kg6 {I was in doubt if to follow with the queen or the rook. Now, with more time, I realize that Rh6+, Kf5 (Kf7, Qf6+, Kg8, Rh8#), Qf6+, Kg4, Rg1#, but on the spot I didn't. Pity. } 28. Rg7+ Kf5 {Kf6, Rg8+ and I win. Now, I had to bring in the other rook, and get rid of defensive forces, so...} 29. Rxg5+ Kxg5 {Tempo is all. } 30. Rg1+ {It is funny how long my queen keeps "en prise" undisturbed.- } Kf5 31. Qh7+ Kf6 32. Qh6+ {Kf7 loses to Rg7#.} Kf5 33. Qf4# {So it worked, for once :-)}
