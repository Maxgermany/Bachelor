1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 {Played to put me off... 3. Nc3 is normal but there's nothing wrong with this.} Bg7 4. g3 {The fianchetto variation has caused me problems in the past and sets the King's Indian player a whole set of different challenges from other variations.} O-O 5. Bg2 d6 6. O-O c5 {Going into a sort of Benoni, always a choice for the KI player if he doesn't fancy ...e5 today.} 7. d5 Na6 {An old-fashioned approach I first learnt from Harry Golombek's "Instructions to Young Chessplayers" when I was a young lad.  The Modern Benoni approach would be ...e6.} 8. Nc3 Rb8 9. Rb1 {Now I regretted not having preceded ...Na6 with ...a5.} Bd7 10. e4 e5 {I decided to block the position so that I could continue my Queenside operations without worrying about the centre.  If White took en passant I was happy to recapture on e6 with the B, attacking c4.} 11. Bg5 b5 12. Nxb5 Bxb5 13. cxb5 Rxb5 {After the series of exchanges, Black's position feels much more comfortable.} 14. Re1 Qb6 {Puts immediate pressure on b2 and prepares to triple up on the b-file but the Q and rear rook are in the wrong formation for maximum effect.} 15. Qd2 Rb8 16. Re2 Qc7 {So Black starts to reorganise} 17. a3 {White discourages Black's N from joining in the attack on b4.} c4 {Black clears c5 for use by pieces but I was worried about the pawn becoming vulnerable.} 18. Qc2 Rb5b3 {? Failing to see White's simple reply, I thought it would be useful to prevent the b-pawn from moving by blocking it.} 19. Nd2 {This threw me into deep thought but eventually I couldn't find anything better than ceding the pawn for pressure on the c-file.} Rb3b5 20. Nxc4 Rc5 21. b3 Ng4 {This looks a bit random but I was desperate to prevent White from playing Be3, when I'd lose what little initiative I had.} 22. Ree1 {White guards against back-row mates that could occur in some lines.} Bh6 {I'd originally planned ...h6 but this looked more powerful, either gaining control of an important diagonal or swapping the weak B for a stronger one.} 23. Qd2 Kg7 24. Bh3 {White follows suit....} Bxg5 25. Qxg5 {Now White has the potential for a quick kingside assault: hardly my intention when I played 21 ... Ng4} Nf6 26. Ne3 {White's N hastens to the attack, threatening Nf5+.  Compare this steed with Black's hapless nag stuck on the edge at a6.} Qd8 {Black defends the Nf6 so that when the check comes the K retreat doesn't lose it.} 27. Nf5+ Kh8 {breaks the pin but sets up potential forks from f7.  Still, better than 27...Kf8 28. Qh6+ Ke8 29. Ng7+ Ke7 30. Re3 Nc7 31. Rf3 Nce8 when Black is tangled up in abject defence.} 28. Nh6 Rc7 29. Qd2 {Unexpected but White felt he had better prospects on the queenside now.} Nc5 {Now I felt much better....} 30. Bg2 {White's bishop returns to defensive duties.} Qe7 {When we analysed the game afterwards, I remembered rejecting capturing on b3 as too risky but couldn't demonstrate why it was.  We felt that perhaps I should have played 30....Nxb3 here.   ...Qe7 reduces the risk of forks from f7 but leaves the Rb8 undefended.} 31. b4 Ncd7 32. Bh3 Ng8 {Time to get rid of the irritant on h6.} 33. Nxg8 Kxg8 34. Rbc1 Rbc8 35. Rxc7 Rxc7 {Now White's pawn advantage is looking even better.  He has more space and more active pieces.  How was I going to counter-attack?} 36. Rc1 Nf6 {It was essential not to cede control of the c-file.  This move defends the Rc7 while attacking e4.} 37. Rxc7 Qxc7 38. Qe3 {White centralises his Q, defending the pawn.} Qc4 {Offering up the a-pawn for the e-pawn.  I was convinced I had to play as actively as possible or lose meekly.} 39. f3 Qc7 {but there seemed nothing better for now than defending the pawn after all.} 40. Bf1 Nd7 41. Bb5 Nb6 42. Bc6 {Looks like a strongpoint but at this stage the B is required for more active play than statically waiting for his pawns to catch up.} Nc4 43. Qc3 {?! allows Black to give check and transform his prospects but White's attacking plans aren't through yet.} Qb6+ 44. Kg2 Ne3+ 45. Kh3 Qd4 {Now if White were to swap, Black would threaten to quickly queen the passed central pawn.} 46. Qc1 {White avoids the swap and reoccupies the c1-h6 diagonal.} g5 {Played with a view to delivering checkmate.} 47. Bd7 {back onto the Bishop's best diagonal.} h5 48. Qc8+ {and enabling White's Q to commence his own mating attack.} Kg7 49. Qd8 g4+ 50. Kh4 gxf3 {Now White has to keep checking to stop Black from winning.} 51. Qg5+ Kf8 52. Qd8+ Kg7 {Black implicitly offers a draw by repetition.} 53. Kg5 {I was surprised that White didn't take the opportunity but Black has no immediately useful check and White is seeking checkmate.} Qxe4 54. Qf6+ Kf8 {?  Surprisingly we found out afterwards, thanks to my clubmate, that 54...Kg8 55.Qd8+ Kh7! won for Black.  It was instinctive, but wrong, to duck behind the f-pawn again} 55. Qh8+ Ke7 56. Qe8# {}
