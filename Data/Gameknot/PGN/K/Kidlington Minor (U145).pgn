1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {Inviting the Winawer as usual.} Nf6 {Black opts for a quieter game.} 4. e5 {In the past I've suffered interminable boredom after playing 4. Bg5.  I think this is a more flexible continuation.} Nfd7 5. f4 a6 {Rather timid.  My clubmate, who plays the Winawer, was all for an immediate ...c5} 6. Nce2 {So that I can create a pawn chain.} c5 7. c3 Nc6 8. Nf3 cxd4 9. Nexd4 Be7 10. Be3 Nb6 11. Nd2 {I didn't want Black's N on c4, pushing my B away.} Bd7 12. Bd3 Nxd4 13. cxd4 Rc8 14. O-O g6 {? Creates a hole in his kingside and makes castling unattractive, so Black's K gets stuck in the centre.} 15. Qf3 {White seeks to exploit the weakness immediately.} Bc6 16. Qh3 Rc7 17. Rac1 Qd7 {Black establishes a defence along his second rank.  As well as the central K, he also has the problem of disconnected rooks, one of which is tied to the defence of the h-pawn.} 18. b3 Bb5 {? Offers me the chance to double Black's queenside pawns.} 19. Rxc7 Qxc7 20. Bxb5+ axb5 21. Nf3 {This prepares both to attack the kingside and take control of the c-file with Rc1} Ba3 22. Ng5 h5 {?  Allows the following swap of N for 3 pawns that exposes Black's K to attack.} 23. Nxe6 fxe6 24. Qxe6+ Be7 25. Qxg6+ Kd8 26. Rc1 Qd7 27. Qxb6+ {The unplanned bonus at the end of the combination :-)} Ke8 28. Qg6+ Kd8 29. f5 Rf8 30. f6 {and Black resigned, leaving me on 2/3 at the end of the day.}
