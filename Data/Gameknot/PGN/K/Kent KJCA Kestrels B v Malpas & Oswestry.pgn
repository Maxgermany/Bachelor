1. e4 {This was in the 4NCL Online} c5 {It was played on Lichess. My opponent is MikeyMouse456 on there} 2. c3 {He plays the Alapin variation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Alapin_Variation} Nf6 {"The main line in current practice is 2... Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 and can also arise if White offers, and Black declines, the Smithâ€“Morra Gambit (1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 Nf6 4.e5 Nd5).  White has a number of options including 4.d4, 4.Nf3, 4.g3 and 4.Bc4."} 3. e5 {He advances} Nd5 {My knight runs} 4. d4 {He advances in the centre.} cxd4 {More or less forced, otherwise white plays c4 and d5} 5. cxd4 {He takes back} d6 {I attack the centre} 6. Nf3 {He develops} Nc6 {I develop} 7. Bc4 {His bishop comes out.} Nb6 {Knight goes back, tempting white into an unsound bishop sacrifice on f7} 8. Bb3 {But he doesn't fall for that} dxe5 {So I take} 9. dxe5 {He takes back.} Qxd1+ {I take} 10. Bxd1 {He takes back.} g6 {I prepare to fiancetto my bishop, to take aim at the pawn on e5.} 11. O-O {He castles.} Bg7 {I attack the pawn.} 12. Re1 {He protects it.} Nc4 {Not only attacking e5 but also attacking b2, meaning that he can't protect e5 in the most natural way, Bc1-f4} 13. Ba4 {Meaning that this is the only way to protect the pawn.} Bd7 {So now I am threating e5 again.} 14. Bxc6 {So he takes off the knight attacking it.} Bxc6 {I take back} 15. b3 {He attacks my knight.} Bxf3 {I take his knight.} 16. bxc4 {He takes mine.} Bg4 {My bishop drops back.} 17. Bb2 {He at last secures his e5 pawn, but what about his c4 pawn?} Rc8 {So I attack it} 18. Na3 {He defends} Be6 {I attack it again} 19. Bd4 {He counter-attacks} b6 {Not only defends, but this stops his c pawn from advancing.} 20. Rac1 {So now he protects c4} Bh6 {I attack the defender} 21. Rc2 {The only square! Rc3 loses to Bd2 } Bf5 {I attack his rook again.} 22. Rb2 {He moves back. Now I think I can force a draw here with 22.....Be6 23 Rc2 Bf4 24. Rb2 etc but I thought I saw a way to win a pawn, but my plans included a miscalculation!} Bd3 {So I attack th pawn from this angle.} 23. Nb5 {His knight advances. I thought "If I take the c pawn with the bishop then he would take the a pawn with his knight. But what if I take with the rook? He can't then take the a pawn as then I could take his bishop with my rook.  } Rxc4 {So I took it. OK stop - find white's move now.} 24. Nd6+ {Did you find it? Incidentally white would still have had this move if I had taken with the bishop not the rook.} exd6 {I take.} 25. exd6+ {He takes back with a discovered check} Kd7 {King up} 26. Bxh8 {He takes my rook.} Kxd6 {I take the pawn. So I thought that I have bishop and pawn for a rook, but my king is active and I have a queen-side pawn majority. I felt I had chances of saving the game if I got my queen-side pawn rolling and played actively.} 27. g3 {He is trying to cut my Bh6 out of the game.} Rc1 {I decide to exchange his Re1 before it becomes active. This may be a mistake - normally one tries to exchange pawns not pieces if materially down. I would appreciate views.} 28. Rxc1 {So he takes.} Bxc1 {I take back.} 29. Rb3 {Rook of course has to move.} Be4 {So bishop drops back. Of course not Bc4? or Bc2? and Rc3! wins.} 30. f3 {He attacks the bishop again.} Bd5 {Bishop drops back, preventing any rook checks.} 31. Rd3 {Rook pins the bishop} b5 {I start to mobilise my queen-side majority.} 32. Kf2 {He advances the king.} b4 {Pawn up again.} 33. Rd1 {He attacks my bishop} Bh6 {Bishop retreats.} 34. Bd4 {He attacks my pawn.} a5 {Pawn up} 35. f4 {He blocks out my bishop.} a4 {I advance again.} 36. Rb1 {He attacks my b pawn.} b3 {I advance.} 37. axb3 {He takes.} Bxb3 {I recapture this way. If I take back with the pawn, then he has Ra1 and his rook has free reign into my position.} 38. Ke3 {His king comes up again.} Kd5 {And so does mine.} 39. Bb2 {He solidly blocks the a pawn.} Bf8 {I threaten to advance it again.} 40. Ra1 {He blocks it again.} Bc5+ {I throw in a check.} 41. Kd3 {King across.} f5 {Blocking his king-side pawns on black squares, where they may be vulnerable to by black squared bishop, should his rook try and penetrate my position.} 42. Ba3 {He offers a bishop exchange.} Bc4+ {I throw in a check, hoping for Kc3? Bd4+ and wins.} 43. Kd2 {But he doesn't fall for those.} Bd4 {Hitting his rook.} 44. Re1 {With the idea of penetrating my position, but I have my counter prepared.} h6 {This is part of the plan.} 45. Re7 {The rook comes in.} Bb5 {I prevent Rd7+} 46. Kc2 {His king comes across.} Bc6 {A waiting move.} 47. Rh7 {He attacks my h pawn.} h5 {So I put it on a safer square.} 48. Re7 {Rook comes back across.} Kc4 {My king comes in. Now 49. Re6 wins a pawn for him, but may well lose the game after 49....Be4+ and 50...Kb3.} 49. Rc7 {So he comes here.} Kb5 {and my king drops back. I think Kd5 also draws.} 50. Kd3 {His king comes back up} Bg1 {But now his king-side pawns are weak.} 51. Rg7 {He attacks my g pawn.} Bxh2 {I take} 52. Rxg6 {He takes.} Bf3 {Preparing to pop my Bf3 on g4 protecting my king-side pawns.} 53. Ke3 {King across} Bg4 {Bishop back.} 54. Kf2 {He comes in to pick up my bishop, but I prepared a counter. Stop and find black's next move.} h4 {Did you find it? It is the only move I think.} 55. gxh4 {He takes.} Bxf4 {I take. } 56. Rg7 {Presumably preparing Rh7 and advancing the h pawn.} Kc4 {But I still have the passed a pawn.} 57. Rb7 {He prevents Kb6 and threatens Rb4!} Bd2 {I prevent the check and also free up my f pawn to advance.} 58. Rb2 {He attacks my bishop} Bc3 {I attack his rook.} 59. Rb7 {So the rook retreats.} f4 {Pawn advances.} 60. Bc1 {His bishop drops back} Bd4+ {I throw in a check.} 61. Kg2 {King moves.} Bh5 {I block his h pawn and a draw is agreed.
