1. e4 {This game features a pleasing rook sac. In my analysis during the game, I thought it would lead to a level endgame, but I was equally convinced that Jim, my opponent would not find his way through the complications, and would lose. I was delighted to be proved right, and equally delighted that post-match analysis showed that the sacrifice didn't actually lead to a level ending, but in fact won in all variations.} c5 {So standard Sicilian} 2. Nf3 {He keeps to the main line.} Nc6 {And so do I} 3. d4 {He opts for the open variation} cxd4 {Black more-or-less has to take} 4. Nxd4 {And he recaptures rather than gambit with c3} Nf6 {I put pressure on the e pawn.} 5. Nc3 {He defends in the best way} d6 {and I stick with the main line.} 6. Bg5 {He plays the Richter-Rauzer Attack} e6 {and I continue with the most popular} 7. Qd2 {he keeps to the books.} a6 {Black rules out a white knight landing on b5 and prepares the b7-b5 thrust} 8. O-O-O {Jim castles} Bd7 {I continue to develop.} 9. a3 {Now this is a bit unusual. White should keep on developing. I think the plan is to try and discourage black from playing b7-b5-b4 but really it is just weakening the white castled position.} b5 {So I continue with the thematic queen side expansion.} 10. Nxc6 {He exchanges} Bxc6 {I recapture} 11. h3 {Again, this move is rather passive and doesn't achieve much. Jim needs to develop Bf1. f3 to protect e4 or f4 to prepare e5 are two other options.} h6 {Now I needed to develop my Bf8. If I had moved it to e7, black has Bxf6 and if I reply Bxf6 he has Qxd6, and if I retake with the pawn he has Qh6 and my pawns are weakened and 0-0 is ruled out. So I decided to hit his bishop on g5. He is more or less forced to exchange it, otherwise his pawn on e4 drops.} 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 {So I take with the queen} 13. f3 {He finally protects the pawn, but it is not 100% clear why he needs to do this. f4 was probably better.} Be7 {So now I can develop my bishop} 14. Kb1 {It is not clear that his king is much safer here!} O-O {I finally castle} 15. Bd3 {and he finally develops his Bf1, but maybe Be2 was better, to deny me use of the d4 square} Rfb8 {so I start to move my rooks over for attack} 16. Rdf1 {Not quite sure what he is doing here. He needs to throw forward his king side pawns as soon as possible to try and open lines against my king, before I do the same to his king on the queenside.} b4 {So this is the logical follow up} 17. axb4 {he is more or less forced to take} Rxb4 {and I take back} 18. g3 {He wastes another move} Rab8 {so I bring in more re-enforcements.} 19. b3 {He prevents Rxb2, but maybe Nd1 was better, rather than causing another pawn weakness} Qd4 {I planned to follow up with Bf6 and if Kb2 pawn a6-a5-a4 is very strong.} 20. Ne2 {so he tries to push my queen back.} Rb4xb3+ {but I come up with this sacrifice.} 21. cxb3 {He takes} Rxb3+ {I take back. This is the critical position. Now Ka2 leads to Qa4 mate. The question is what to do if he plays the best defence, Kc2? At the time I thought I had to play Rb2+. Now if Kd1 I can take his queen with check and then move my queen to safety. So he has to play Kc1. Play could continue RxQd2, NxQd4, R(d2)xBd3 N(d4)xBc6 R(d3)-c3+ followed by taking his knight on c6 and we have the level endgame I mentioned earlier, where I have bishop and 2 pawns for a rook. I was interested to see later that after Kc2, black does have an improvement on that line, I can play Qa4! with many horrible threats!} 22. Kc1 {But he didn't! it is now mate in 4, but I mated in 5, I took time-out to take his queen.

Nc1 Qc5# {}
