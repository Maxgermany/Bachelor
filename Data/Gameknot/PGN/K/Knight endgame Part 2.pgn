1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is the third game in the trilogy.  GA analysis is here!  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=27025480&fb=1&rnd=0.891668996769549} e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 {2. ..... Nf6 - another Bishop's Opening - this time I play Nf6 rather than Bc5.} 3. Nf3 Nxe4 4. Nxe5 d5 5. Qf3 {5. Qf3 - now white gets aggressive.  Henry is threatened with a Scholar's type mate.  My knight now drops back to f6.} Nf6 6. Bb3 Bd6 7. d4 c6 {7. ...... c6 - I shore up d5 but I am a bit concerned about Henry being exposed on the  e column.} 8. O-O Be6 9. Bg5 Be7 10. Re1 O-O {10. ...... 0-0 at last I manage to get Henry off the e column.} 11. Nc3 Nbd7 12. Qg3 Nh5 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 14. Qf3 Nxe5 15. Rxe5 Nf6 {15. ..... Nf6 - after a plethora of exchanges I am still a bit under pressure.  Still, things can sometimes change in a space of a few moves.} 16. g4 Nd7 17. Re3 Qg5 {17. ...... Qg5 - like this!} 18. h3 h5 19. Qg3 hxg4 20. hxg4 Qxg4 21. Kg2 Qxg3+ 22. Rxg3 g6 {22...... g6 - and another plethora of exchanges leads me to be a pawn up!  Could be very handy later!} 23. Rh1 Kg7 24. Kf1 Rfh8 {24. .... Rh8 - I do not want to allow a white rook pile up on the h column.} 25. Rhg1 Rh4 26. Ne2 Rah8 27. f4 Rh4h1 28. c3 Rxg1+ 29. Rxg1 {29. Rxg1 - rook trade.} Rh2 30. Rg2 Bh3 {30. .... Bh3 - it looks as though this move will force instant resignation.  However, white has one clever resource up his sleeve.} 31. f5 Rxg2 32. Nf4 Rxb2+ 33. Nxh3 gxf5 34. Nf4 Nf6 {34. .... Nf6 - I do become 5 points up in material though.  However, my opponent makes me work very hard for the win.} 35. Nd3 Rxb3 36. axb3 {36. axb3 - I attempt simplification and am now in a knight endgame with a 3 pawn plus.} Ne4 37. c4 Nd2+ {37. .... Nd2+ - fork.} 38. Ke2 dxc4 39. bxc4 Nxc4 {39. ..... Nxc4 - White declines a further invitation of simplification  into a king and pawn ending with me two pawns up.  However, I am now 4 points up in material.} 40. Kf3 a5 41. Nc5 b5 42. Kf4 a4 {42. .... a4 - pawn roll.} 43. Kxf5 Na5 44. Nd3 a3 45. Nb4 Nb3 46. Ke4 Kg6 47. Kd3 f5 {47. .... f5 - now another passer is pushed.} 48. Kc3 Na5 49. Kc2 f4 50. d5 cxd5 51. Nxd5 Kg5 52. Nc3 b4 {52. ..... b4 - closer and closer.} 53. Ne4+ Kg4 54. Nf2+ Kf3 55. Nd1 Ke2 56. Kc1 a2 {56. ..... a2 - if white plays Kb2 to prevent my a pawn from crowning then Henry will just snap off the knight on d1 and the f pawn will have a clear run to Glendadom.  White sees this and waves the white flag.  For now that is the end of endgame study because in my next annotation I will be going back to the middlegame and Glenda is again involved in a mating attack, but will she succeed?  You will have to wait and see.}
