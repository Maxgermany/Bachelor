1. c4 {A long time since I've played against this, not as comfortable against  this as I am against 1.e4 but more comfortable than 1.d4 } Nf6 {Very flexible  and allows me to adapt to what he will play } 2. g3 {Suits me just fine } g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 d6 {Wanting to free my LSB. A bit more popular seems to be  castling immediately, but this is fine too. Alternative variation: 4. ... O-O [Alternative]  } 5. d3 O-O 6. e3 c6 {Robs my knight of the c6 square but I was hoping to play my  bishop out and then put the knight on d7. } 7. Nge2 {Now it's a bit harder to  find a plan for the LSB, the pin on g4 is easily foiled with f3. Alternative variation: 7. Nf3 Bg4  [Was the plan, possibly even to give up the LSB for this knight]  } Nbd7 {I'll  wait to deploy this Bishop. This move is in my database, but it suggests the  more logical ...d5 Alternative variation: 7. ... d5 [Make ...c6 have had a purpose!] 8. cxd5 (8.  O-O Re8 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Nf4 e6 11. d4 Nc6 [Black has survived the opening  just fine] ) cxd5 9. b4 e5 10. O-O [And Black is doing fine so far and we  begin to journey into the middle game.]  } 8. O-O Ne8 {My plan now was to play  e5 and f5, played in Belan Vladimir v Simek Petr in 2000, but doesn't seem  like close to the best plan. Alternative variation: 8. ... Re8 [To prepare e5 and free f8 for the  knight, additionally e5 could be pushed immediately.]  Alternative variation: 8. ... e5 9. Rb1 a5  [Freeze the queenside for the moment and create an open file for the rook  once the pawn captures on the b-file to help prevent the Queen from getting  too active.] 10. a3 Re8 11. b4 axb4 12. axb4 Nf8 [Black has a fine game.]  } 9. b4 f5 {Since he seems willing to let me I go ahead! At the time I did not  forsee just how much more dangerous his queenside expansion is and I let it  go far too long. } 10. Rb1 e5 11. b5 {Now I start to see, but in my haste I  miss the move that helps hold the position together. } Qc7 {Alternative variation: 11. ... cxb5 12.  Nxb5 (12. Rxb5 Rb8 ) (12. cxb5 Ndf6 ) Ndf6 [I was seeing ghosts in all these  variations somehow and didn't think I could take.]  } 12. bxc6 Nc5 {Still  inaccurate, bc6 is better, but Black is almost lost even here. I was hoping  to tempt d4 then play ...Ne4 block the Bishops diagonal for a few precious  moments. Alternative variation: 12. ... bxc6 13. Nd5 Qd8 (13. ... cxd5 14. Bxd5+ Kh8 (14. ... Rf7  15. Bxa8 Nb6 ) ) 14. Nb4 [All seems bad to me, and indeed Black is under a  lot of pressure so I played 12...Nc5]  } 13. d4 Ne4 14. Nxe4 {A bit inaccurate  from White, let's Black hold on a bit more. Alternative variation: 14. Nd5 Qf7 15. cxb7 Bxb7 16.  dxe5 Bxd5 17. Qxd5 Qxd5 18. cxd5 Bxe5 19. f3 Nc3 20. Nxc3 Bxc3 [Black is  down a pawn, his position is wide open and his pieces are very uncoordinated.  +-]  } fxe4 15. cxb7 Bxb7 {It seems that I may have escaped just a pawn down  (and certainly positionally worse), I was envisioning much worse. White is  still certainly better, but Black hasn't quite given up hope yet. } 16. Qb3 Rb8 {Hoping to get a pair of rooks off as well if possible and blunt White's  attack } 17. Bxe4 {Seems necessary before the discovery, but in fact White is  stronger to allow Black to build up the center a bit first, since White will  be able to attack it easily Alternative variation: 17. c5+ d5 18. Nc3 Nf6 19. Nb5 Qd8 20. Nxa7  [Now White has two pawns, and can start to open the position even more.]  } Bxe4 {Planning to exchange off the rooks at least } 18. c5+ {However my  opponent makes a huge blunder! I understand how this happened, he saw it as  an "intermezzo" before we traded rooks, and indeed I almost did not recapture  since I thought I was forced to move the king! Luckily however I caught my  mistake before I played it and simply... Alternative variation: 18. Qxb8 Bxb1 19. Qxb1 Qxc4 [White  has an advantage, but not as concrete as before.]  } Rxb3 {White resigns. }
