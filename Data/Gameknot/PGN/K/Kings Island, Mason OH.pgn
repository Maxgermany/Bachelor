[Opening "Sicilian (B20), Keres variation (2.Ne2)"]

1. e4 c5 2. Ne2 {My opponent was a little kid and  sometimes I will play this instead of Nf3 to see if it throws them. If I see  2...Nc6, ...d6, or ...e6 then I will play 3. d4/4.Nd4 right away, but  sometimes odd things happen and then you can play d3/g3/Bg2 and play a closed  Sicilian if your opponent seems uncomfortable. } a6 {Not sure if my opponent  was planning on playing 2...a6 if I had put my knight on f3, when d4 now is  not a good move for White, or if he wanted to play a type of Najordf and got  confused to my move order. In either case I've lost playing d4 before in this  position much earlier in my chess playing career and learned my lesson. } 3. c4 {Not the popular response in my database (although this positino is not  very popular anyway) but recommened is Nbc3. However I know the lines with c4  and the knight on f3 and planned to transpose back if I could. } e5 {3...e5 is  given as the only win for Black in my database and I was a bit suprised to  see it. My plan to play d4 and transpose clearly will not work anymore. } 4. Nbc3 Nc6 {The database has 4...Nf6 here and at the time I was suprised to see  that my opponent did not contest d5. I knew it was early but figured that  this was turning into a bit of an odd game anyway, so why not jump into it if  I could. } 5. Nd5 d6 6. d3 Nge7 7. Nec3 {I wondered at this point if we would  end up in a close to symmetric boring (for me) position where we both trade  opposite colored Bishops for the knights posted on d4 and d5, but my opponent  had different ideas in mind. } Ng6 {Seems my opponent didn't want to play that  kind of position either, but I wasn't quite sure what this was meant to  accomplish. } 8. Bd2 {Probably a bit inaccurate, better is Be2 preparing to  castle. The DSB isn't sure yet what square it wants to go to but it almost  certainly isn't d2. } Be7 9. Be2 O-O 10. Bg4 {Probably a bit over eager,  wanted to trade off the LSBs and try to play on my "better" DSB but didn't  quite think about f5 until after I moved. Better castle and then worry about  it. } f5 11. Bh3 {Not the best try for White after Alternative variation: 11. exf5 Bxf5 12. Bxf5  Rxf5 13. Qg4 [Let's White keep developing and not purely responding to  Black's threats.]  } fxe4 {But Black goes for a different line Alternative variation: 11. ... Bg5  12. Bxg5 Qxg5 [Black seems to be the more comfortable]  } 12. Bxc8 Rxc8 13. Nxe4 {I felt very comfortable here, I thought that I had made an inaccuracy  with 10. Bg4 (almost certainly true) but Black must have misplayed and I had  recovered. } Nf4 {A move that suprised me, it seems like offering this trade  does not do much for Black but helps White. Now I saw the Qg4 idea and  willingly gave up my Bishop. } 14. Bxf4 exf4 15. Qg4 {+= I think, White  has the attack though and the position is a bit easier to play for them. } Qa5+ 16. Nec3 {It seems like Qa5+ has misplaced the Queen a bit. } Rce8 17. O-O-O {Short castling is better since Black can quickly build up pressure and  White's move has immensely helped Black's Queen which just a moment ago  seemed a bit out of play. Alternative variation: 17. O-O Qd8 [Needed to protect the Qd7 threat]  18. Nxf4 Nd4 19. Ne6 Nxe6 20. Qxe6+ Kh8 21. Ne4 [And White is better  instead +-]  } Ne5 {? But my opponent misses it and goes for something a bit  too aggressive, not envisioning the Queen diving into Black's camp. Alternative variation: 17. ...  Bf6 18. Nxf6+ Rxf6 19. Kb1 b5 (19. ... Nd4 20. Rhe1 Ree6 21. Rxe6 Rxe6 22.  Qxf4 b5 [And White is very uncomfortable -+] )  } 18. Qe6+ {Clearly the  move for White, I'm suprised my opponent overlooked it as any other reply is  very very weak. Perhaps he just misevaluated the resulting position after  ...Rf7 } Rf7 19. Rhe1 {Very inaccuarate and probably deserves a ? as well. Now  Black can play ...Qd8 and solves many problems. They will be cramped but can  untangle themselves slowly. Better was to take on e7 immediately. Alternative variation: 19. Nxe7+  Rxe7 20. Qxd6 [And white has a strong edge.]  } f3 {But again my opponent gets  too aggressive and misses the defensive line. Now I correctly take Alternative variation: 19. ...  Qd8 [Tough to extricate themselves, but many immediate problems are solved.]   } 20. Nxe7+ Rexe7 21. Qxd6 Nc6 22. gxf3 {No need to realease Black yet } Qc7 {And he drops another pawn, but the queen needs to get involved in the  defense. Alternative variation: 22. ... Rxe1 23. Rxe1 h6 24. Re8+ Kh7 25. Qd5 Qc7 26. Qxc5 [And  the pawn still eventually falls]  } 23. Qxc5 {Now with my c and d pawns (and  I'm already envisioning forcing him to capture on e3 and some point and  having an e-pawn as well) I can feel the win, just need to execute now. } Qf4+ {The perfect opportunity to fix my pawn structure } 24. Re3 Rxe3 25. fxe3 Qxf3 26. Ne4 {Bring my knight into the fight, and help control f2 to eliminate any  counterplay ideas down the f-file. } Re7 27. Rd2 {Inviting ...Qf1+ but this is  not an issue for White, and the second rank is the one I want to control with  the knight on e4. } Qf1+ 28. Kc2 Rf7 {Afraid of Rf2, but Re5 gives Black some  more activity. At this point barring any huge blunder from White though, he  should easily win. } 29. a3 {To allow me to pin the Rook against the King  without walking into a fork on b4. } Qh3 30. Ng5 {I thought this just  immediately lost for Black, missing his Qf5 resource, but I keep finding the  correct moves to hold the pressure and trade down. } Qf5 31. Qd5 {Pretty much  forcing the Queens and the Knights to come off the board, inching White's  victory closer. } Qxd5 32. cxd5 Rf5 33. dxc6 Rxg5 34. cxb7 Rb5 35. Rf2 {Alternative variation: 35. d4  [A bit of a faster way to get to the win, to just push the pawns that my rook  is already behind.] Rxb7 36. d5 Kf7 37. Kd3 Rd7 38. e4 Ke7 39. Kd4 Rc7 40. e5  Rc1 41. d6+ Ke6 42. Ke3 Rc8 43. Ke4 g5 44. b4 Rf8 45. d7 Rd8 46. a4 [A bit of  a fast]  } Rxb7 36. d4 Rc7+ 37. Kd3 a5 38. b4 axb4 39. axb4 Rb7 40. Kc3 Rc7+ 41. Kb3 Re7 42. Rf3 g5 43. h3 h6 44. b5 Kg7 45. d5 { } Kg6 46. Kc4 Rc7+ 47. Kd4 { } h5 48. e4 g4 49. hxg4 hxg4 50. b6 {A nice inbetween  move here } Rb7 51. Rb3 Kf6 52. e5+ Kf5 53. e6 Kf4 54. e7 {The fastest way } Rxe7 55. b7 Re4+ {Obviously he is now objectively completely lost. } 56. Kc5 Re3 57. b8=Q+ Kf3 58. Rxe3+ Kxe3 59. Qg3+ Kd2 60. Kc4 Kc2 {I realize he won't  resign so I try to find the fastest mate. } 61. Qg2+ Kc1 62. Kc3 Kb1 63. Qb2# {}
