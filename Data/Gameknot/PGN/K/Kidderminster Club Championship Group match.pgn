1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 {delayed d4 as I sometimes play Bb5 against an e6 set up.} Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 a6 6. Bc4 e6 7. f3 {preventing Nxe4 and preparing for Be3 (without the annoying Ng4)} Be7 8. Be3 {Fairly standard set up against a Sicilian Defense..} Nbd7 {0-0 may be more accurate?} 9. Bxe6 {I was quite happy to give up the Bishop as I get 3 Pawns and leave him behind in development with his king exposed.} fxe6 {Black has to recapture} 10. Nxe6 {attacking the Queen and g Pawn} Qa5 {the only square for his Queen.} 11. Nxg7+ {forcing his King to move} Kf7 {he attacks my Knight} 12. Nf5 {... so it has to retreat} Qc7 {extra cover for d6} 13. Nxe7 {Wasn't sure if giving up a Knight in such a strong position was best but I felt that the following pin after Bg5 was going to be difficult for him to meet.} Kxe7 {he has to recapture with his King} 14. Bg5 {so it seems logical to go for the pin} Kf7 {removing the pin....} 15. Qd4 {increasing the pressure on f6 and also re-pinning the Knight due to the h8 Rook and preparing for Queenside castling. } Rg8 {I would say that this is a blunder and he obviously missed the combination that follows.....} 16. Bxf6 {first taking the Knight on f6} Nxf6 {black recaptures but he missed.........} 17. Qxf6+ {the manufactured fork, getting back the sacrificed piece with interest....} Kxf6 {he takes my Queen} 18. Nd5+ {but the fork follows} Kf7 {King moves} 19. Nxc7 {regaining the Queen but also hitting the Rook on a8.} Rb8 {Rook has to sidestep} 20. Kf2 {Black resigns... as this leaves him 3 Pawns down.}
