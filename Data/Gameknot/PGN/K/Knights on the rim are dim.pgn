1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Na5 {Knights on the rim are dim? Not here, the main line of the Two Knights Defence. The alternative 5. ... Nxd5 is hairier. Here I am giving up a pawn temporarily in order to gain time attacking White's two minor pieces.} 6. d3 {Not as fashionable as 6. Bb5 , but if Morphy was happy with it then who are we lesser mortals to hold it in contempt?} h6 7. Ne4 {The usual here is 7. Nf3. The text is a blunder, as two units are guarded only by the same pawn, and as long as I make the right capture first I must come out a piece ahead.} Nxe4 8. Qf3 Nxc4 9. dxc4 Nf6 10. O-O Bd6 11. Nc3 Bg4 {Castling first would have been safer and better, I think, but I thought kicking the White Queen around would be fun.} 12. Qg3 Qd7 13. f3 {Gives the Queen a square, but weakens the King's position.} e4 14. Qf2 exf3 15. gxf3 Bf5 {The position's not without its risks for me, of course, as I have delayed castling. I thought I might as well put the Bishop here with a threat against c2; 15. ...Bh3 is only sending the Rook where it wants to go anyway.} 16. Re1+ Be7 17. Bf4 {I was looking forward to an uncomfortable time if the Queen came to the e-file to reinforce the pin, as it's then difficult for me to castle and keep my extra piece. In some lines White seemed to be getting a dangerous attack. However, this doesn't put any pressure on the pinned Bishop and so I can castle straight away - only on the King's side; much as I would like to castle Queen's side and storm the White King's position, I would have a hanging pawn on a7 and would deeply regret it.} O-O 18. Qg3 Nh5 {Knights on the rim are dim? Not this time, as the fork wins me more material. White is losing a whole piece as the Queen has no square from which to guard the Bishop, so he lashes out in an attempt to muddy the waters.} 19. Rxe7 Qxe7 {Obviously not 19. ...Nxg3; 20. Rxd7 and White has plenty to be happy about.} 20. Re1 Qc5+ {But this forces the Queens off and I stay a Rook for a Pawn ahead.} 21. Be3 {21. Qf2 is worse.} Qxe3+ 22. Rxe3 Nxg3 23. hxg3 Rfe8 {Usefully for me, White has no option but to exchange Rooks.} 24. Rxe8+ Rxe8 25. Nb5 Bd7 26. Nxc7 Re2 27. c5 Rxc2 28. b4 Rxa2 29. b5 Rc2 {Now White has no alternative but to give his last three Q-side pawns for the Black Bishop and b-pawn, leaving an elementary win for Black.} 30. c6 bxc6 31. bxc6 Bxc6 32. dxc6 Rxc6 33. Nd5 {For now Black has a pawn majority on both wings, and promises to emerge with both passed Rook's pawns - a hopeless situation for the Knight. First, however, White threatens a fork, so Black has to deal with the situation.} Rd6 {Played in order to cut the White King off from the a-pawn. But now White sees a pawn and makes haste to grab it.} 34. Ne7+ Kf8 35. Nc8 Rd7 {...With disastrous consequences. Knights on the rim *are* dim, this time; not only can White not safely take the pawn, but his Knight has no safe squares at all.} 36. f4 Ke8 {The Knight cannot be saved; after 37. f5, f6 prevents a rescue, and the King simply marches up to the hamstrung horse. Black then needn't even Queen a pawn or take either of White's, but it is easy to do either or both, so White resigned.}
