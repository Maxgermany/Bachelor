1. e4 {This training match is between two members of The Kingslayer team.  We appreciate your comments so we can all improve together.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {I am a big fan of Petrov.  If you open against me with e4, expect to go there.} 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d3 {I prefer a more aggressive d4 or Bc4 here as White, but this line is perfectly playable.} Bb4 {I like bishop/knight pins against a king to see if I can create any pressure or "juke" my opponent into making a mistake.  } 5. Be2 d5 {exploiting the pinned knight to try for some early center advantage...} 6. O-O Bxc3 {Now that White has castled, if I take this knight, I can create a little center play where I go up a pawn, at least momentarily.} 7. bxc3 dxe4 8. Ng5 {Good counterplay.  This move gives White a potential post for a knight in my territory and allows him to undouble his pawns on the c file.  Top play for White.} exd3 9. cxd3 O-O {Now that I've created a little center chaos, time to castle and then get that White knight out of my side of the board if I can.} 10. Ba3 {Building some pressure to begin an attack for White.} Re8 {This move was going to happen eventually anyway, as I needed some more protection for that e pawn.} 11. Bh5 {This is a decent move for White.  Instincts are good on bringing pieces into the fray this aggressively.  White is threatening Bxf7+.  If Nxh5, then Qxh5 spells trouble as I can't protect both h7 and f7 at the same time.  As a result, I only have one option.    Another play for White to consider is Bf3, as it threatens my queenside and I don't have a lot of good options to protect it quickly.} Be6 12. Re1 {I didn't expect this move and am not certain what White is hoping to accomplish.  I would have traded knight for bishop with Nxe6 instead.  However, now that White is allowing me to get rid of one of his two power pieces on my half of the board, I must partake.  If you allow an opponent to have power pieces on your side of the board for a while, they become liabilities quickly.  Don't let them get established and drive them away or trade if it's not disadvantageous.} Nxh5 13. Qxh5 h6 {to protect against Qxh7#.  I didn't consider Qxd3, which I should have played instead, as it would have netted me another pawn, but you can't make the top play every time, otherwise the game wouldn't be any fun.} 14. Nxe6 Rxe6 15. Rad1 {bringing over to protect the d3 pawn.} Qf6 {Looking to either trade queens or create space to make a play with the e pawn.} 16. Bb2 {I don't know that the bishop was in a bad spot, but putting a bishop on the main diagonal is rarely a bad choice.} Rd8 {Rooks love open and half-open files.  When in doubt, place them there.  I also have the added benefit of being protected by my knight.} 17. Re3 Qg6 {Offering a queen trade.  If not I have a good diagonal on the d3 pawn and some potential for penetration to White's back rank.} 18. Qf3 {White declines the trade.  I would have considered moving to h3 instead to keep the potential for using my rooks to harass the Black queen, but keeping a protective line on the rook at d1 is a good idea too.  A key facet of higher level play is to try and have your pieces work in harmony together.  Let them mutually support and defend each other so that you don't leave pieces exposed to themselves and vulnerable to pins/attacks.} e4 {This play has some attacking potential and a chance to create openings for counterplay.  Notice that there are several disastrous ways that Black can respond here.  A lot of chess is about giving your opponent a chance to shoot themselves in the foot and create openings to exploit.  Let's see how Black responds.} 19. Qf4 {Mistake!  What I expected was:  19.	Rxe4	Rxe4 20.	dxe4	Rxd1+ 21.	Qxd1	Qxe4} Rxd3 {Time to get a little aggressive and see how far I can drive this advantage.} 20. Rdxd3 {Another mistake.  Either Rf1 or Re1 would have been better.  Now things are about to get ugly for White.  You don't want your opponent to have a passed pawn so close to promoting.  Not having an escape route for your king also causes some of this trouble, due to potential for a back-door mate.  White will be constricted in their choices because they will leave themselves open to mate otherwise.} exd3 21. Rxe6 {I haven't explored it fully, but Bd1 might be worth considering as well.} Qxe6 22. h3 {Major blunder.  White desperately needed to play Qd2 here (which would have been followed by 22. ... Qe2), but this move seals White's doom.} Qe1+ {Now White can only trade queen for pawn and slowly die.} 23. Kh2 d2 24. c4 d1=Q {This game was really close for a while, but a few key mistakes let it slip away.  Black was able to capitalize on a back-door mate threat to ram a pawn down the center for promotion.  Thanks for your comments/review.}
