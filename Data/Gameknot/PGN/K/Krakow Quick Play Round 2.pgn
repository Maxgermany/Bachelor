1. d4 {In the first round I was black against  Paweł Pityński, 1485, the tournament organiser, who I had beaten when I played in the same tournament in April. Playing black I developed an attack on his king, which was wandering round the king-side. I forced him to sacrifice a pawn and the exchange. But he got back into it. He had a winning position, but we both became short of time and we reached an opposite coloured bishops ending which probably was drawn. So I wanted to win this one.} d5 {Incidentally this was reconstructed after the game. I think I have done it accurately, but it is possible that the move order is not correct. } 2. c4 {Queen's Gambit.} c6 {Slav Defence.} 3. Nf3 {The usual move.} Bf5 {But this is slightly unusual.} 4. Nc3 {The most common reply.} e6 {And so is this.} 5. Bf4 {So I also decided to develop my queen-side bishop outside the pawn chain. Looking at the opening database now, I see that Qb3 is more commonly played, and scores better. That is on its way...} Nf6 {His knight comes out.} 6. e3 {So that if he takes on c4 I can recapture immediately with my bishop.} Bd6 {He develops Bf8.} 7. Bxd6 {I am happy to exchange my "bad" bishop on the same coloured squares as my central pawns.} Qxd6 {He takes back.} 8. Bd3 {I copy his idea.} Bg4 {He avoids the exchange. I see on the databases that black has played BxBd3, dxc4 or Bg6 in this position. This seems to be a new move, according to the limited Gameknot databases.} 9. h3 {I hit his bishop.} Bh5 {He retreats.} 10. Qb3 {I attack b7} b6 {He defends.} 11. Ne5 {My knight advances before he exchanges and doubles my pawns.} Bg6 {The bishop drops back.} 12. Nxg6 {I take. unbalancing the position slightly.} hxg6 {He correctly captures towards the centre.} 13. O-O-O {Slightly ambitious maybe....} O-O {And now the position is unbalanced...} 14. Kb1 {I move my king to a safer square.} dxc4 {He has the plan of attacking on the queen-side, which is what he should be doing.} 15. Bxc4 {I take back.} b5 {His queen-side expansion starts.} 16. Bd3 {Bishop drops back.} a5 {Queen-side expansion again!} 17. f4 {while I dream of action on the king-side and centre.} Nbd7 {His Nb8 finally moves.} 18. Ne4 {With the idea of discouraging c6-c5} Nxe4 {He takes.} 19. Bxe4 {I take back.} f5 {He hits my bishop.} 20. Bf3 {Bishop drops back, keeping the c6 pawn pinned against the rook behind it.} Ra6 {He breaks the pin.} 21. Rdc1 {Still wanting to discourage c6-c5.} a4 {He hits the queen.} 22. Qc2 {Queen drops back.} Rc8 {More preparation for c6-c5.} 23. Rhd1 {This half pin on the d file discourages c6-c5 again.} Nf6 {His knight seeks better squares.} 24. g4 {My king-side advance starts.} b4 {And his queen-side action continues.} 25. Qc4 {I attack his rook.} Rb6 {Rook moves.} 26. Qc5 {I offer the exchange of queens.} Qc7 {He turns it down.} 27. Qe5 {Offered again.} Qd7 {Declined again.} 28. Rc5 {Blocking c6-c5 once and for all.} Nd5 {Knight comes in.} 29. Rdc1 {support for the Rc5} a3 {Trying to prise open a file on the queen side.} 30. b3 {So I block.} Nc3+ {H throws in a check. I thought long and had about sacrificing the rook for knight and pawn here, but evntually decided against it.} 31. Ka1 {And played this.} Kf7 {One king move deserves another, but probably a mistake.} 32. Rg1 {I prepare to open a line on the king side.} Rb7 {I am not 100% sure this was the move he played. Rh8 instead stops what happens next and keep black in the game.} 33. gxf5 {I open a line.} exf5 {Of course, not taking back with the g pawn, otherwise Rxg7. Now for my best move of the tournament. What did white play?} 34. Bh5 {Did you find it? I think black is lost now.} Re8 {Seeing that taking the bishop loses the queen he tries this.} 35. Bxg6+ {I take.} Kf8 {King moves back.} 36. Bxe8 {I take. Now his rook was NOT on b7, as I remember he couldn't take on e8 with his queen he would have been mated by Qxg7.} Qe7 {He played this.} 37. Qxf5+ {I took this pawn.} Kxe8 {He took my bishop.} 38. Re5 {I pinned his queen.} Rb5 {He tries a counter-pin.} 39. Rxe7+ {But I take with check.} Kxe7 {He takes.} 40. Rxg7+ {I am mating now.} Kd6 {He tries this, but...} 41. Rd7# {And this is mate. Many thanks for reading, sorry I haven't reconstructed this game properly, but you get the idea! Please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system.}
