1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 Bg7 4. d4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 {tournament position; i shouldn't have played this tournament. I hate black position... 7th move is so unnatural to me} 9. Bg5 {white seems to have so much space, it is out of decency. Look at queen side! Look at king side!} Ne8 {Black seems so Steinitzian!} 10. Qd2 f6 {try to regain some space} 11. Bh6 Kh8 {preparing the super defence.} 12. h3 {preparing the super attack} Ng8 {super defence} 13. Bxg7+ Nxg7 {i am sure Steinitz would have liked this... I feel a hedgehog} 14. g4 {i am surprised nothing came on the queen side. Nc3 is so passive.} a6 {well, now he will stay so. I had in mind to explode white attack since the previous move.} 15. a4 f5 {so be it! I calculated that I may have an advantage here by getting out of my black hole.} 16. exf5 gxf5 17. Qg5 {other possible moves: Ng5 is pointless; gxf frees my pieces; what about g5?!} Qxg5 {fxg would have allowed white to play Qxd8 and make me lose tempos and positions. Losing also the defence of e4 crucial to fix the second knight} 18. Nxg5 h6 19. Nf3 fxg4 20. hxg4 Bxg4 {won a pawn, exposed to many traps... like...} 21. Nh4 {this one> i can't take the bishopm because of Ng6!! But I foresaw it.} Bf5 {this is the best defence: I protect both my bishop and g6} 22. Kh2 {preparing the artillery} Ne7 {overprotecting the bishop and the g6 point.} 23. Nxf5 {white renounces to its potential fork} Rxf5 {black develops. It is now cleraly better...} 24. Ne4 {good position, but the knigh must feel very lonely} Rf4 {was I preventing Bg4? I don't remember, but white answer here determined my victory... } 25. f3 {this is definitely a mistake. the white bishop is now reduced to passive defence and the pawn is now a very good target for both knight in 2 moves...} Rg8 {and now is coming the second cannon} 26. Kg2 {i will gain a tempo thanks to this move. Did white have a choice? It was threatened by Rh4 followed by Ngf5+} Ngf5+ 27. Kf2 Nd4 {first knight on the position.} 28. Rfh1 Rg6 {Kh7 exposed to potential knight check.} 29. Bd3 {obviously a mistake, and deciding the next moves, but let's see what where white perspectives. i was about to 1) approach my king to g7; 2) play Nf5-h4 (unless white had played Rh3 and Rah1; in this last case i still had good possibilities by taking the bishop with the first knight and postioning the second on d4...  i expected an eventual defence by Nd2, allowing then Rgf6 and the decisive e4!... )} Rxf3+ 30. Ke1 Rxd3 31. Kf2 Rf3+ 32. Ke1 Nc2+ 33. Ke2 Re3+ 34. Kd2 Rg2+ 35. Kc1 Kg7 {i played cat-mouse, here, and forgot to take the knight...} 36. Ra2 Rxe4 37. b3 Re1+ 38. Rxe1 Nxe1 39. Rxg2+ Nxg2 {i guess now jon tried to find a draw} 40. Kd2 e4 41. Ke2 Nf5 42. Kf2 Nf4 43. b4 Nd3+ 44. Ke2 Nxb4 45. Kf2 e3+ 46. Kf3 Nc2 47. a5 Nfd4+ 48. Ke4 e2 49. Kd3 {hey, man, he really tried to confuse me here,} e1=N+ {so i decided to play this little trick} 50. Kc3 h5 51. Kd2 h4 52. c5 h3 53. cxd6 cxd6 54. Kd1 h2 55. Kd2 h1=Q 56. Kc3 {the last 15 moves were only a loss of time, but i can't blame jon to try...}
