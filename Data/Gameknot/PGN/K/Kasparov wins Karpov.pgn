1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O Be7 8. f4 O-O 9. Kh1 Qc7 10. a4 Nc6 11. Be3 Re8 {Until here, standard, "book" moves. The two will manouver very slowly seeking for an attack line, in a strategic display.} 12. Bf3 Rb8 13. Qd2 Bd7 14. Nb3 b6 15. g4 {White has to risk some more if he wants an attack line.} Bc8 {Black has time to relocate his lsb on the big diagonal. } 16. g5 Nd7 {White's position seems overwhelming, while black is completely stuck on his third rank, pieces all together... normally, a losing scenario, but hey, it's Kasparov behind it. He has everything under control. The deepness of the defence is far beyond my ability to decode it. } 17. Qf2 {Attacks b6 and, indirectly, f7. And delays the bishop's run to b7. } Bf8 {Now the other bishop will search for the fianchetto. Very delicate. } 18. Bg2 Bb7 19. Rad1 g6 20. Bc1 {Is Karpov protecting b2 against a future B(g7)xb2?} Rbc8 21. Rd3 Nb4 22. Rh3 Bg7 {Leontxo says white should have played f5 right now.   23.	f4-f5	e6-f5 24.	e4-f5	b7-g2+ 25.	h1-g2	c7-b7+ 26.	g2-g1	c8-c4 27.	f5-g6	c4-g4+ 28.	h3-g3	g4-g3+ 29.	h2-g3	d7-e5 30.	g6-h7+	g8-h8 31.	f2-f5	b4-c2 32.	f5-c2	e5-f3+ 33.	f1-f3	b7-f3 34.	c2-f2	f3-d3} 23. Be3 {It would be a mistake trying to get the advantage on c3:   23.	c1-e3	g7-c3 24.	b2-c3	c7-c3 25.	e3-d4	c3-h3 26.	g2-h3	c8-c2 27.	f2-h4	        b7-e4+ 28.	h1-g1	d7-f8} Re7 {Covering f7. Now, f5 for white doesn't work anymore.  24.	f4-f5	e6-f5 25.	e4-f5	b7-g2+ 26.	h1-g2	g7-c3 27.	b2-c3	c7-c3 28.	e3-d4	c3-c2 29.	g2-g1	c2-f2+ 30.	f1-f2	e7-e1+ 31.	f2-f1	e1-f1+ 32.	g1-f1	g6-f5} 24. Kg1 {White is attacking, but he has some weaknesses he has to take care of. } Rce8 25. Rd1 f5 {Can you imagine how deep calculations must be performed in order to be able to play this?} 26. gxf6 e.p. Nxf6 {"Kasparov entrega b6 a cambio de armon√≠a y actividad." says Leontxo: Kasparov gives away b6 seeking for harmony (piece coordination) and activity. } 27. Rg3 Rf7 28. Bxb6 Qb8 29. Be3 {I won't say ?, but it seems to deserve it. The pawn costed 2 tempoes, and the white's queenside is weak. The white's attack over the black king is not going anywhere, right now. } Nh5 30. Rg4 Nf6 31. Rh4 {Karpov needs to win, he cannot allow a draw. } g5 32. fxg5 Ng4 {Better thank Nxe4, according to Leontxo. This move wins the c2 pawn, and eliminate one of the most active white pieces. } 33. Qe2 Nxe3 34. Qxe3 Nxc2 35. Qb6 {White is now playing against black's central pawns. } Ba8 {QxQ, RxQ, Bh3! would have be the right move. Leontxo says Karpos was in time trouble here.   36.	b6-b8	e8-b8 37.	g2-h3	b8-b3 38.	h3-e6	b3-c3 39.	b2-c3	g7-c3 40.	d1-d6	g8-g7 41.	e6-f7	g7-f7 42.	h4-h7+} 36. Rxd6 Rb7 37. Qxa6 Rxb3 {3 pawns for a piece would be nice, but more white pawns will fall. } 38. Rxe6 Rxb2 39. Qc4 Kh8 40. e5 {Leontxo says this is a mistake. In fact, Rb1+, NxR, QxN+, and white has a hard time defending against multiple threats. But here, the simple Ne3 seems to win. } Qa7+ 41. Kh1 Bxg2+ 42. Kxg2 Nd4+ {This was actually played. I don't understand why not Ne6++, winning the queen. Maybe is there a mate somewhere. }
