[Opening "KGA (C33), bishop's gambit"]

1. e4 {This is a standard move for many players. Although not statistically significantly better than 1. d4, it is still a very strong move as it attacks two center squares and opens lines for pieces.} e5 {This move is the second most played move next to 1. ...c5. It refutes my center control and opens lines for his pieces.} 2. f4 {This position is known as the King's Gambit. The goal of the opening is to get a long-term queen-side attack by removing Black's center pawn and having surplus pawns than the opponent. It is not very frequently played as the games are often too short and risky for class players, and Black has a good chance of equalizing in grand master games.} exf4 {Black accepts the gambit and loses all control of the center for a while. However, White's king-side is worsened and no pieces are developed. Likewise, Black does not either. In order to make something out of the game, White must attack ferociously or immediately recapture to compensate for the lost pawn.} 3. Bc4 {If I remember, I first saw this move being played not too long ago, and White won in ten or so moves. After 3. ...Qh5 4. Kf1, the king is somewhat safe and Black has an out-standing queen in the sense that it is prematurely developed. For a player who is testing out the King's Gambit, or in other words me, I would recommend 3. Nf3 as a start.} h5 {The objective of this move was to prevent Qh5, which attacks f7 and puts the queen in an attacking position, and start a king-side forward offense/defense. More typical is 3. ...g5 or a knight move. 3. ...Qh5 is also possible as an instance move.} 4. Nf3 {Now I play Nf3 to prepare to castle. I should have played d3 or d4, but I wanted to attack to see how far I would get.} g5 {This move makes it difficult to recapture on f4 and now the king-side is hard to break from the respective side. On the flip side, Black is severely down in development and I have plenty chance to recuperate.} 5. Ne5 {I targeted f7 without thinking about my move. I am not familiar with the main line, but I think that d3, d4, or even h4 would have lead to a better game than did here.} Nh6 {This move develops the knight and protects the f7 pawn albeit keeps the knight on the rim. The h5 pawn is now undefended.} 6. d4 {I played this move without thinking, entranced by the opening rush. I overlooked Qxh5, which seems like a very strong move because it equalizes the gambit made earlier and undermines the f7 pawn with a pin.} Qe7 {The queen has to defend the attack; otherwise the game may as well be lost. The bishop  can fianchetto on g7 and have a strong diagonal. In all truth, I would have played this move, but Nc6 seems like a  good move to consider.} 7. Qxh5 {I finally realize that I could have played this move, and not much time is lost.} Qf6 {This was played to protect the rook should I play Nxf7. This way, Black's knight can recapture. At this point, my arrogance lead me to my downfall. I probably should have retreated here.} 8. Nc3 {My intentions with this move were to develop another piece and move it to d5 with a triple fork. At this point in the game, I was making simple one-move threats hoping to get one to slide, which is exactly how not to win a chess game. Retreating the queen to d1 or e2 would have been much better in my opinion.} c6 {This move protects against my meager threat.} 9. g3 {I wanted to attack at all costs. If Black accepts this gambit, I would play Rf1 which will finally get to the f7 pawn.} d6 {This chases my knight away. I have no use for it if my rook gets on a semi-open f-file.} 10. gxf4 {I capture and get rid of one f-pawn. If black captures the knight, I capture back with my f-pawn.} gxf4 {He captures my f-pawn, and at this point I would prefer to be Black. My queen is overdeveloped and my pieces are too entwined within the enemy position and blocked from retreat by my own pieces.} 11. Nxf7 {No other move is better with the knight. I hoped to get a good game from this.} Nxf7 {As aforementioned, Black can recapture with the knight and still be safe.} 12. Bxf7+ {If Qxf7, 12. ...Qxf7 13. Bxf7 Kxf7 leads me down the exchange. In addition, my Bxf7 nullifies Qxf7 which now leaves the Black rook unattended.} Kd8 {A simple move is played. The only problem with this move is that Black is lost if a bishop somehow manages to get on g5.} 13. Qg6 {Any other move would have lost the bishop or queen. I offer a queen exchange and hope to remain up a pawn for the rest of the game.} Bg7 {Black wants to get a tempo after the exchange. Be7 may have worked just as well.} 14. Qxf6+ {I trade queens. There is not much to say here.} Bxf6 {Black recaptures. I get thoughts that I may lose the pawn advantage and be left with a bad position. I would still prefer White, but things look even more bleak on the king-side.} 15. Bxf4 {I capture the f-pawn because I had no intention in keeping my d-pawn anymore. The attack is long gone and I wanted to get a peaceful endgame, but the isolated e-pawn may have proved troublesome. It turned out to be bad because two undefended bishops on the same open file is seldom convenient.} Bh4+ {Instead of capturing my pawn, Black wants to skewer my bishops and dislocate my king. This move proved very troublesome because I could not protect with my bishop. After 16. Bg3 Bxg3 17. hxg3 Rxh1+ and I lose both rooks and may as well resign.} 16. Ke2 {Kd2 would have worked, but I wanted the luxury of knowing that I would be able to access d3, e3, and f3 at the same time.} Rf8 {And here comes the skewer. As a matter of fact, I noticed the skewer the move before.} 17. Raf1 {I act with my corner rook to indirectly defend both pieces. If Black captures my bishop, 18. Bg5+ wins it back. Unfortunately, there was no stopping the capture.} Bh3 {My rook has nowhere to go. Any move on the file will lose it. I didn't want to lose my bishop, so I avoided moving my rook altogether.} 18. Bxd6 {If Black captures my rook, I recapture with my other rook and I am winning by two pawns. Black was smarter than this, however.} Rh8 {Black moves his rook to the only safe haven. At this point, I would consider myself winning.} 19. Rf4 {I didn't want to leave my beloved f-file which helped me win the game, but I lose my advantage here. The Black bishops get a chew toy and make me suffer from this move on.} Bg5 {This move forces my rook to move a second time, but I have nowhere to go. I didn't want to draw the game, so here comes mistake number 2.} 20. Rf5 {Losing an advantage has never become easier. The new Rook Drop Toolkit is only 10 in any currency, and you too can make your opponent a happier person. I never imagined this move to bring so much pain. If Black captures, it makes winning the game much more difficult.} Bg4+ {Black wants to move my king once again before capturing. Once again, I did not want to draw.} 21. Kd3 {I advance my king. My king's arrogance made me lose the game.} Rh3+ {Black attacks even more. At this point, the game is still not decided.} 22. Kc4 {The only legal king move was played. Now that I think of it, Bg3 would have been interesting.} b5+ {Still attacking my king. Here is where I make the mistake. I should have played played Kb3, but my arrogance takes me too far. Somehow, I thought that I would win this game, but overlooked a simple move.} 23. Kc5 {The game is over from here. Either I lose my bishop or I get checkmated. There is nothing more gruesome than making a king walk and losing a game because of it. It worked for Nigel Short, I believe!} Kd7 {This was a move I did not notice in the game. If I capture the bishop on g5, then Na6# is played. If I play Kb4, then I lose my bishop via Kxd6 or rook via Bxf5. I captured the troublesome, yet undeveloped, knight.} 24. Bxb8 {And here is the grand loss. I was expecting 24... Rxb8 25. Rxg5 and a winning game, but I was foolish enough to overlook a two-move checkmate.} Be7+ {This was a fantastic move by Black. My king is trapped and my only possible move is Bd6.} 25. Bd6 {I felt like resigning the move before, but I never resign. There is always a chance. The probability may be 1/aleph-0, but there is still a chance.} Bxd6# {And that is the game. I applaud my opponent for the spectacular game. Just as a note, I did mention that I did not want to draw the game, but no draws were offered for the duration of the game; what I meant was that I wanted to avoid threefold repetition because I was winning by three pawns and I expected that my opponent would want to draw. I believe that my fatal blunder was at move 23, but I could be wrong. Beginners may learn how to retaliate from a seemingly lost game, Black in the beginning, and White at the ending, and to look at every possible move and search tree. Advanced players can learn from the opening because not many players that I know are familiar with it. In example, I played the Vienna's Gambit against a USCF Candidate Master several months ago, and I won due to the fact that he did not know the opening. Anyway, thanks for your time and I hope you enjoyed my annotation. I hope that we come face to face in a game, and have a nice day!}
