1. e4 {king pawn opening} e5 {i answer with my normal opening} 2. Qf3 {i don't know quite what he is thinking, maybe attack f7?} Nf6 {i open by attacking the enemy pawn} 3. Bc4 {he continues the three move checkmate, even though my knight has put a stop to it} Bc5 {i continue my normal opening and getting ready to castle at the same time} 4. d3 {it looks like he is going to bring his bishop out} d6 {maybe i should of castled there, but i do that instead} 5. Bg5 {i thought he might of done that when i saw he moved his d2-d3 pawn} Nc6 {i still have the opportunity to castle} 6. Bxf6 {he takes it } Qxf6 {a move which can be discussed was that a good move or bad... in my opinion it was good} 7. Qxf6 {he swaps queens} gxf6 {and i can forget castling king side} 8. c3 {he starts getting a good pawn formation } Bg4 {i stop him castling queen side, for now} 9. f3 {a move i anticipated } Be6 {i chose to swap bishops} 10. Bxe6 {he liked to swap things i found out in my first game} fxe6 {i got a good control over the center i feel} 11. Ne2 {he gets ready to castle} d5 {i plan to take his pawn and by doing that i can break up his formation and get rid of the double pawn formation on e line} 12. exd5 {he takes it } exd5 {and now i feel i have got a good control of the area} 13. Na3 {a knight at the side is grim... learnt that of jkarp a very good player who has commented on all my annotated games and taught me quite a bit (even though later on my knight goes on the edge a couple of times)} O-O-O {i castle as planned, looking back at move 4 one would think i would castle king side} 14. b4 {he is quite aggressive } Be3 {and so am i} 15. d4 {a blunder in my opinion, as i got three pieces protecting it, whilst he has two} exd4 {i take} 16. cxd4 {he takes} Bxd4 {i chose bishop, but one could argue that i should of taken it with knight} 17. Nxd4 {he takes} Nxd4 {i take and i am a pawn up, an advantage i don't give away} 18. O-O {he castles } Ne2+ {and i start a knight attack} 19. Kf2 {not wanting to lock his king in a corner} Nc3 {i retreat with my knight, but keep control of a good area } 20. g4 {he opens up left flank} d4 {and i try for a queen} 21. Rac1 {that move didn't mean much for me} Rd6 {i got ready to double up my rooks/castles. What is the right name for them?} 22. h4 {he moves forward his pawns} Nxa2 {when i see an unguarded pawn i usually take it} 23. Rc5 {a good move by him} Nxb4 {and another pawn up for me} 24. Kg3 {he protects his remaining pawns} d3 {i push up for a queen} 25. f4 {he has a nice line of pawns} d2 {i push up again} 26. Rd1 {and no surprise there he stops me} Nd3 {i have a plan} 27. Rc3 {and he has not seen it } Nb2 {opps, i have forced him to move his castle} 28. Nb5 {he tries an attack} Rd5 {no thank you} 29. Nxa7+ {and he comes and checks me} Kb8 {i move} 30. Nc6+ {why????? he gave me his knight} bxc6 {which i gladly take} 31. Rb3+ {he tries to take my knight} Rb5 {and i answer that} 32. Rxb5+ {he takes it } cxb5 {and i take it... i am a knight and two pawns up, which at this point of the game is very important } 33. Rxd2 {i had almost forgotten that pawn} Nc4 {i protect my knight} 34. Rc2 {i don't really have to answer here} Ne3 {but i do} 35. Rb2 {he is trying to pick of my pieces } c6 {not that i will let him} 36. Rb3 {i had expected a move like that} Nf1+ {check} 37. Kh3 {a move i wouldn't have done, as he can no longer move left} Nd2 {i attack his castle} 38. Rc3 {ok didn't quite expect that} Kc7 {i had two choices Kb7 or Kc7, i could also move castle, but that would mean losing (most likely) the left flank} 39. g5 {he attacks} fxg5 {i take it } 40. hxg5 {he takes it} Ne4 {again i attack the castle} 41. Re3 {well he attacks me again} Nf2+ {i try and find a way to weaken his position} 42. Kg3 {that didn't help} Nd1 {i retreat my knight} 43. Re7+ {an unexpected move} Kd6 {i stop him from checking me again} 44. Rg7 {it looks like he is about to start an attack} b4 {i just move my pawns quite like and wait for the big and final attack of white to start} 45. g6 {ok} hxg6 {i take} 46. Rxg6+ {he takes and check} Kc5 {i protect both pawns} 47. Kg4 {he will soon get a castle if i am not careful } b3 {well i would rather have a queen} 48. f5 {he tries} b2 {he can not stop me from getting a queen} 49. f6 {but he tries} b1=Q {and i have a queen} 50. Rg5+ {an unexpected move, i expected Kg5} Kd6 {i move my king} 51. Rg7 {and i start a a checking spree :D} Qe4+ {the only good check i could do, i studied Qh7 and swap castle for queen, but thought i would do this instead} 52. Kg3 {he moves } Qh4+ {two possibilities, Qxf6 or check here, i chose check for now} 53. Kf3 {he moves} Qf2+ {i am really just chasing him around} 54. Ke4 {and now i realize that i should of taken the pawn} Qxf6 {i take it} 55. Ra7 {i don't think he wants to lose the castle} c5 {i begin pushing up for another queen} 56. Ra6+ {you could call my last  move a blunder, but look at it like this, 1 king vs. 1 castle, 1 knight, 1 pawn and 1 king, that is how i looked at it like} Ke7 {any other move and i would not of won} 57. Rxf6 {no surprise} Kxf6 {big surprise, not....} 58. Kd5 {he attacks the pawn} Rh5+ {not happening} 59. Kc4 {he blocks my pawn} Ne3+ {i wanted to check that my knight was still alive, after not using him so long... i had thought of sacrificing that piece, but i did not need to} 60. Kc3 {he moves} c4 {protected by the knight} 61. Kd2 {and he attacks my knight} Nf1+ {RUN!!! } 62. Kc3 {he goes back to attacking me} Rh4 {and to make sure i did not get a forced draw, i moved my castle} 63. Kc2 {he moves} Ke5 {i move up to protect my pawn} 64. Kc3 {stopping me from going to d4} Kd5 {it will take a move longer for my queen} 65. Kc2 {he moves} Kd4 {i move} 66. Kc1 {the next moves are quite boring } c3 {as i try to get a queen and he tries to stop me} 67. Kc2 {and stop me he tries} Rh2+ {have to be careful of stalemate} 68. Kc1 {as he is locked dawn in 1 row} Kd3 {i move king up} 69. Kd1 {he does one of two moves possible} c2+ {and of course he will not move to e1 which will give me checkmate in 1} 70. Kc1 {but he moves there} Rd2 {with only one possible move} 71. Kb2 {i get ready for queen} Rd1 {3 possible places} 72. Kb3 {and i have a......} c1=Q {QUEEN at last} 73. Ka2 {the end is close... closer then i actually saw at first} Qa1+ {he has to move to b3} 74. Kb3 {as said} Rb1# {Well i never saw that coming when i started to play him. a very good opponent ans it was fun to play him... feel free to comment and i hope you found this fun}
