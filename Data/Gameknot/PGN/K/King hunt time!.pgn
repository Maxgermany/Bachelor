1. e4 {This is a game I played against rio1962 - he was extremely good until he faced an unstoppable (?) mate. Enjoy.} e5 {Normal.} 2. Qh5 {[?!] Here, it starts to get intriguing - I have reviewed rio1962's playing style and noticed that somehow he likes to develop his queen early. } Nc6 {I defend the e5 pawn.} 3. Bc4 {[!?] Bc4- the most obvious, threatening Scholar's mate.} g6 {Another way was Nh6 or d5, but this seemed better.} 4. Qf3 {Having a second try.} Nf6 {Again, blocking mate.} 5. Qd3 {[?!] I do not understand this move, but perhaps he wanted to make c3 a flight square for his knight.} Bc5 {I develop my bishop - of course, considering there is a hole on g7, I could have fianchettoed it, but all the well.  } 6. g4 {[?] I considered this move, and thought it to be a rather waste of a pawn - the idea is clear - g5 Ng4 7. Qd5 threatening mate, or 6. ... Nxg4 7. Qd5 but then I can play Qf6/Qe7 and that would defend it well.} Nxg4 {[!?] I take the pawn.} 7. Qd5 {[!?] The reason that this move is not given a [!] is that the f2-pawn is target and I can play Bxf2+, but I decide playing Qf6 was safer.  EDIT: This move attacks the c5 bishop as well as mate, so the best move is Bxf2+.} Qf6 {EDIT: [??] Leaving a piece to be taken on c5, and after Bxc5, f2 is also covered.} 8. f3 {[?] Rather, this move loses the rook. EDIT: Loses rook for bishop.} Nf2 {Winning the rook for the bishop.} 9. d4 {This gives me a chance to save my bishop.} Bxd4 10. Bg5 {[!] This move is good since after Bxg5 there would be checkmate on f7.} Qe6 {I considered this the only move other than Qg7.} 11. Qb5 {Notice how now my queen is also attacked.} Qd6 {I manoeuvre. } 12. Qd5 {The queen returns to offer an exchange - I would not have played this.} Qxd5 {The exchange is gladly accepted.} 13. Bxd5 Nxh1 {Here I had two options - Nxh1 and Bxb2, both trapping the rooks.} 14. Nd2 {Wisely letting the rook go free.} Bxg1 {... But leaving the light loose - actually, after Ke2, this is a bit of a skewer, but I still win the h2 pawn.} 15. Ke2 {Exactly.} Nd4+ {But now, the king hunt begins.} 16. Kd3 {King is advancing.} Nf2+ {No more skewer for white!} 17. Kc4 {Advance again - I was scrounging for a mate at this time.} c6 {I decided that 17 ... b5+ wouldn't be very good, so I decided to kick the bishop away.} 18. Rxg1 {He nabs my bishop.} b5+ {Now that I have a more advanced connection, I play b5+/} 19. Kc5 {He advances again, rather than retreating to c3.} cxd5 {I take the bishop.} 20. exd5 {PxP.} Bb7 {The main aim here is to develop the rook to c8.} 21. Kd6 {He marches even further into my camp - this is getting dangerous - surely there is a mate somewhere - if you see one at this stage, please tell me in comments.} Nf5+ {A check from me.} 22. Kc7 {Not Kc5!? but Kc7? White is marching into my camp now. Not 22. ... Rc8?? 23. Kxb7.} Bxd5 {I take the pawn, and now the king is stalemated. Only one check and it is gone.} 23. Bf6 {My rook is attacked by the bishop - so I castle.} O-O 24. h4 {[??] This leads to an unstoppable mate as far as I can see - perhaps Be7 could save it, but here you will find the magnificent mate.} Rab8 {Rb8! - and there is no good move to defend against the threat of Rb7# - If you see one, please tell me. Even Kxd7 and Rb7 is still mate. } 25. h5 {Sadly, the game is lost, but I have to say the rio1962 played extremely well, but the moral is, don't invade your opponent's comp with a king.} Rb7# {And mate. Well played rio1962, and thank you for watching. Please rate and make any necessary comments. @oodle3}
