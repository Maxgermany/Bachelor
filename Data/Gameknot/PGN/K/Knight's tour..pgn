1. d4 {I like this game because of the 7-move knight maneuver that won a pawn, the exchange, and eventually the game for black.} e6 2. c4 f5 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 d5 {Dutch stonewall} 5. cxd5 {Black is happy with this trade, since his weak e6 pawn disappears.} exd5 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. Bg5 {White should try to exchange his dark bishop for black's good dark bishop, not for the knight.  Bf4 Bxf4, for example; b3 is also played, but black prevents white forcing bishop exchange on a3 by Qe7.} c6 8. Nc3 {In stonewall, the knight is often useless on c3; it is more common to play Nd2, then Ne5, Nd3 and then Ndf3, concentrating on e5.} h6 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. O-O O-O 11. e3 Nd7 {I was afraid of white going for minority attack (a3, b4, then b5), and wanted to have the option of moving my knight to c4 after white played b4.} 12. Rc1 {I believe white chooses the wrong plan. He should move his queenside pawns in a minority attack, a3-b4-b5, and once black is forced to compromise his queenside pawns, the power of white bishop on g2 would grow. However, white would find it more useful to have both rooks on the a and b files. So I'd play Qe2-Rfb1, or a3-b4 immediately.} g5 {Black is trying to get some space on the kingside and eventually an attack; but it's premature, as black's queenside is not developed. I should have played Qe7 and Nf6 instead. White reacts correctly to this flank aggression -- by pressuring the center, he uses his better developed pieces to get a positional advantage.} 13. Kh1 Rf7 {I thought since white does not seem to be attacking on the queenside, the knight will be very helpful to my attack on g6 or e6, supporting f4 advance.} 14. Nd2 {Hmm.. white must be trying to prevent black from moving f4 by playing it himself. Then black's knight on g6 or e6 will be useless. I can't play f4 now because white will answer e4.} Qe7 {?  A mistake. I thought this move accomplished two missions at once: prevent white from moving f4, and vacating the f6 square for the knight. But I missed a simple tactics: 15. Nxd5! cxd5 16. Bxd5 getting a pawn advantage.} 15. Qh5 {? Black misses it too. Besides, this just loses time.} Kg7 16. Qe2 Nf8 {Here I decided that if white wanted to play f4, my knight can simply go to h7 and the f6. I can not afford delaying developing my c8 bishop and a8 rook just because of waiting to place my knight on the best square!!} 17. f3 {This is a much stronger plan than f4, and I underestimated it. Black can't stop e4, and after opening up the game white's lead in development will be a big advantage.} Ne6 {Preventing e4 for another move.} 18. Qd3 Bd7 {Black can do nothing but finish his development and hope for the best. On 18 ... f4 white can answer 19. gxf4 gxf4 20. e4, when black king is in more danger than white.} 19. e4 Nc7 {Unfortunately forced. I had planned f4, but it just loses the d5 pawn.} 20. e5 {Now white has definite advantage, but the pressure is off and black is given some time to defend. Rce1 was a good alternative.} Bb4 21. Ndb1 {? White needed to play f4 and cement his advantage, whether or not black opens the f file.} f4 {Grabbing the opportunity to lock white's g2 bishop by his own f3 pawn; also planning Bf4.} 22. a3 Bf5 23. Qd2 Ba5 24. b4 Bb6 25. Na4 {? Not paying attention to black's threats against d4 and a3. a4 was better.} Nb5 {Black wins a pawn by force.} 26. Nc5 {! Loses a pawn and let's my knight all the way to e3, but it does save white's d4/e5 pawns that later will be white's main hope.} Bxb1 27. Rcxb1 Nxa3 28. Rb3 Nc4 29. Qd3 Ne3 {The knight has gone a long path, b8-d7-f8-e6-c7-b5-a3-c4-e3, winning a pawn and finally occupying a cramping position in white's camp.} 30. Re1 Bxc5 31. bxc5 Qe6 {Preparing to defend b7 with the rooks, also threatening to offer queen exchange on f5.} 32. Rxe3 {! I can't blame white for giving me the exchange, otherwise he would have a hard time defending with no counterplay.  Still, Rb1 would make black work harder to realize his pawn advantage.} fxe3 33. Qxe3 b5 {A small tactical trick of my own: 34. cxb6 axb6, and if 35. Rxb6 then Ra1  wins a bishop.} 34. Bf1 Rb7 {Not accurate, as it allows white advance his f pawn. A more convincing win was Raf8, when white would have to defend on both sides of the board.} 35. Bd3 a5 36. f4 a4 37. f5 {White even has chances to win now.} Qf7 38. f6+ {Where should the king go?} Kg8 {?! I had thought the king may be important in stopping the pawn, but Kh8 was more precise, see move 42. (Kf8 was even worse because of h4)} 39. Rb1 b4 40. Rf1 Re8 41. Qf3 b3 42. Bf5 Kh8 {Correcting my 38th move mistake: White threatens e6, and I can't answer Qxf6 because of Bh7  and Qxf6.} 43. Re1 {Bg4 was better, threatening immediate e6.} a3 44. Bg4 b2 45. Bh5 {If 45. e6, then b1=Q works similarly.} b1=Q 46. Rxb1 Rxb1+ 47. Kg2 Rb2+ 48. Kh3 Qd7+ 49. Bg4 Qh7 {Black still has to be careful: queen retreats other than to f7, h7 and d8 would lose a rook to 50. f7 (Rf8?? 51. Qf6  and Bf5#).} 50. f7 Rf8 51. e6 Rb7 52. Qxa3 {I had looked at 53. Qf6  Qg7 54. e7 Rxe7 55. Qxe7 Qxf7 as the best white can do, but still black wins there.} h5 53. Be2 Qf5+ 54. Kg2 Qxe6 55. Bxh5 g4 56. Qd3 Rb2+ 57. Kg1 Qe1+ 58. Qf1 Qe3+ 59. Kh1 Rf2 60. Qg1 Qf3+ {Please comment on the game if you notice any mistakes in my analysis. }
