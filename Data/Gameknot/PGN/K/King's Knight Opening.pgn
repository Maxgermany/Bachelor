1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bc5 3. c3 {With the idea of establising a pawn duo in the centre} Nc6 4. d4 exd4 5. cxd4 Bb6 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. h3 {Probably unnecessary with Black's d7 pawn still on it's home square and so there is no immediate threat of Bg4 to undermine White's centre.  Perhaps a move like Bc4 or even Be2 is better} Ba5 {This pin is not able to be readily exploited by Black and I'm fine with the exchange if Black so decides to capture} 8. Bc4 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 {The exchange allows White to further strengthen his central pawns} Qe7 10. O-O {If 10. ...Nxe5 then 11. Re1 pinning the Knight followed by Nd2 for example winning a piece} Kf8 {Surely a blunder} 11. Re1 d6 12. Bg5 h6 13. Bh4 g5 14. Bg3 {In order to break the pin Black has had to considerably weaken his kingside} Na5 15. Qd3 Nxc4 16. Qxc4 Be6 17. Qd3 g4 18. hxg4 {Although White is a pawn up, Black seems to have good chances of developing an attack on the kingside.  White must be careful.} h5 {Naturally I don't want Black's Rook on an open h-file but there seems very little to prevent this having played into this position} 19. Ng5 hxg4 {Opening the file but also allowing to exchange a piece thereby eliminating one piece from the attack} 20. Nxe6+ Qxe6 21. e5 {Endeavouring to generate counter-play in the centre} Nd5 22. exd6 {With a discovered attack on the Queen and opening the e-file; active defense} Qh6 {This is not quite as bad as it looks because the King can make it to the Queenside, but I'm still unsure at this stage how White's position will stand after the dust settles} 23. Kf1 Qh1+ 24. Ke2 Re8+ 25. Kd2 Qh6+ 26. Kc2 {I think this is an important cross-road for Black. He can recapture the pawn but only at the expense of weakening his pawn structure.  Is there a continuation of his attack?} Nf4 {? Losing a piece...} 27. Rxe8+ Kxe8 {Black reigned.  A possible continuation could be 28. Qe4+ and if 28. ...Ne6 then 29. d5 wins the Knight or 28. ...Qe6 then simply 29. Qxf4 also wins the Knight }
