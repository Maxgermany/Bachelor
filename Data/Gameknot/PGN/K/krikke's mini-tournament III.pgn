1. e4 c5 {east-indian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. h3 {unknown variation to me. Not sure I see the point for this move.} Nc6 4. c3 {considerably breaks the knight moves.} Nf6 5. Bd3 {that is a complete surprise.} e5 {I felt comfortable with this, though d6 seems weak: white is so closed, that black has to take advantage of it and move on} 6. Bc2 {bishop has already 2 moves and does not seem to be clearly pointing something interesting. } Be7 7. O-O O-O {well, yes, both bishops and the queen are pointing to king side, but with so much obstacles, and pointing to h6 and 7, is it really pointing?} 8. d3 {one more obstacle for lBc2} Be6 9. Nbd2 h6 {preventing} 10. Bb3 {probably discovering his bishop is worthless; tries to exchange with advantage by queen development. I won't help} Qd7 {actually my idea was to take back with f7 if ever needed, to open f column.} 11. a3 {??} b5 {well, let's go: white seems not to have any  plan. Mine was to take advantage of my own progression.} 12. Bc2 {getting back home? Is White some kind of a hedgehog?} a5 {f won't open => let's open a-b-c} 13. Qe1 a4 {preparing b4} 14. Nh2 {Ah, finally, proposing an opening on f4?} Nh5 {closing it} 15. Ndf3 {?? that was the idea?} f5 {then I open f-column; i also have all my officers ready to point there, except Nc6} 16. Be3 {pointless} f4 {the space is getting darker} 17. Bd2 Rf6 {preparing Rg6 or, if Nh4, then g5. I calculated Bxh3 was prematurate} 18. Qe2 {i guess Black saw a potential Nxe5 dxe and Qxh5} g6 {with the idea to get back to Ng7, then g5, g4} 19. g4 {but it won't be necessary: white offers me the opening.} fxg3 e.p. {if fxg, then Nxg3} 20. Ng4 {at least gains one more pawn} Bxg4 21. hxg4 Qxg4 22. Bd1 {surprise, but not a bad one: this really underestimates the next move.} gxf2+ 23. Kxf2 {the less worse.} Rf7 {i considered Rxf3, but it lead to equalizing, without profit.} 24. Rg1 {pretty sure Ke1 was better} Bh4+ {then if Kf1, Ng3+ Rxg3 Qxg3 is the best solution, but...} 25. Ke3 Qf4# {}
