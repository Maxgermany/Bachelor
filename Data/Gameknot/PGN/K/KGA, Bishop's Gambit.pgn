1. e4 e5 2. f4 {King's gambit, one of the most exciting openings in chess. } exf4 3. Bc4 {This was the starting point in the mini-tournament.} Qh4+ {This was very popular in the older times. However it is now accepted that 3...Nf6 or 3...d5 is the best continuation} 4. Kf1 {This is necessary. 4.Ke2 is worse.} Nh6 {A move that I have not seen before. I think the idea was 5...Ng4, but such hopeful plans rarely turn out as you want them to.} 5. Nf3 {A good move, developing and knocking the Queen away.} Qe7 6. Nc3 {I must say I was happy with my position right now. I have 3 pieces developed and rearing to go} Nc6 {The GK computer sees this as an inaccuracy and suggests 6...c6 as best. Although I'm sure a human would not consider this move. I wouldn't} 7. d4 Na5 {I have two options. Move the bishop foward or back. If I play Bb5 or Bd5 it is met by c6. Bd3 or Be2 aren't bad but I played...} 8. Bb3 Nxb3 9. axb3 c6 {9...g5 defending the pawn can look troublesome. But after 10. Nd5 Qd8 (forced since 11.Nxc7+ is threatened.) 11.Nxg5! takes care of that.} 10. Bxf4 {White has regained the pawn with no problem what so ever.} d6 11. Bg5 {11. Bxh6 immediately is fine, but why not cause another weakness in the position?} f6 12. Bxh6 gxh6 13. Nh4 {Opening up play for the Queen. 14.Nf5 can also arise, if I wanted to.} Bd7 14. Qh5+ {Heh. The computer gives Nf5 as best! Since I played it a move later I guess I got away with it. } Kd8 {Both our kings have lost the right to castle. I was expecting 14...Qf7, The computer's suggestion, but I would happily oblige a trade of Queens.} 15. Nf5 Bxf5 {I have to decide whether to take with the pawn or the Queen. I had to weigh the pros and cons of the capture. } 16. exf5 {I decided to play this move for two reasons. This plans 17.Re1 which gives me the e-file. And this might give me an opportunity to trade queens.} Qe8 {16...Bg7 is a possible alternatative. 17. Re1 Qd7 18.Ne4 looks good for White though.} 17. Qxe8+ Kxe8 18. Re1+ Kf7 19. Kf2 {Connecting my rooks to exploit my control of the e-file} d5 20. Re2 {Going through with my plan.} Bd6 21. h3 {This starts an uncomfortable series of moves for me. 21.g3 is better.} Rhg8 22. Re3 {Preventing 22...Rg3 followed by 23...Rag8,which would have been very bad for me.} h5 23. h4 {?! The computer finds this as a no-no for me and gives the advantage to Black for the first time in the game. I agree. This creates holes on the g-file. I wanted to stop 23...h4 however 23.g3 was better to stop this} Rg4 24. Ne2 { A move which protects the pawn AND still covers g3.} Rag8 25. g3 c5 26. c3 cxd4 27. cxd4 {Now my b-pawns look plan silly.However,they are untouchable for the time being. I need to keep them that way.} a5 28. Rg1 {The computer gives 28.Ra1 as best. However, I don't agree with the reply to it. Wouldn't it make more sense to play 28...b6 instead. If 29.Re6  29...Bc7.} b6 {Computer gives this as a mistake reply. } 29. Re6 {I like 29...Bc7 better. White cannot move the rook from g1 away from the defense of the g-pawn and it eliminates the pin on the Bishop} Rd8 {? This I think is the real blunder. Black relieves his pressure from the g-file,allowing White's other rook to join in and take the c-file. Black begins to fall downhill after this move} 30. Rc1 {All of the sudden,the tides have turned and Black scrambles to defend} Re4 31. Rxe4 dxe4 32. Rc6 {Now White has won a pawn.} Ke7 33. Rxb6 Bb4 {Another bad move.Black now gives away another pawn.} 34. Re6+ Kf7 35. Rxe4 Rd5 36. Rf4 Bd2 37. Rf3 Rb5 38. Rd3 {? This gets Black into realistic drawing range. I knew that it would leave the f-pawn hanging,but I forgot it was going to be with check.} Rxf5+ 39. Kg2 Be1 {40...Rf2+ is threatened.} 40. Rf3 Rd5 41. Rd3 Ke7 {?? Game-losing blunder. 41...Rf5 again was best.} 42. Re3+ Kd6 43. Nf4 {Now a fork against the rook and the bishop.} Rxd4 44. Rxe1 Rd2+ 45. Re2 Rd4 46. Nxh5 {From here it is all about converting the advantage. The rest is without comment.} f5 47. Nf4 Kc6 48. Re6+ Kc5 49. Re5+ Kb4 50. Rxf5 Rd2+ 51. Kh3 Rd7 52. Kg4 Ra7 53. Rf6 Kxb3 54. Rb6+ Kc4 55. b3+ Kc5 56. Rh6 Kb4 57. Rb6+ Kc5 58. Rb8 Rg7+ 59. Kf3 Rf7 60. Rc8+ Kb4 61. Rb8+ Kc3 62. Ke4 Ra7 63. Nd5+ Kd2 64. Rc8 a4 65. bxa4 Rxa4+ 66. Ke5 Rg4 67. Rh8 Rxg3 68. Rxh7 Kd3 69. Nf4+ Ke3 70. Rf7 Rg8 71. h5 Re8+ 72. Kf5 Re4 73. Ng6 Ra4 74. h6 Ra5+ 75. Kf6 Ra6+ {}
