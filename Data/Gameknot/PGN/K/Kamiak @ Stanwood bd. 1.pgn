1. d4 d5 2. c4 Bf5 3. Nc3 e6 4. Nf3 Bb4 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 dxc4 7. Bg5 Qd7 8. e3 h5 9. Bxc4 {I did not see the bishop trap, and I dropped a pawn as a result.} f6 10. e4 Bxe4 11. Bd2 {Be3 may have been better, but I think I wanted to defend my c pawn in case of Qc6, but even then I could play Qb3.} g5 12. h3 Qc6 {Qb3 right now might have been much better, but apparently I planned to push my c pawn and let my bishop rest on b4, which wouldn't really do me any good.} 13. Be2 Nd7 14. Qb3 a6 15. c4 {Here I go, advancing on the queenside, beginning to neglect my kingside.} Ne7 16. Bb4 Rh7 17. Bd3 {Bad move: I hang the knight at f3 and would end up dropping my g pawn. Fortunately my opponent didn't see it. (Yes, when I made this annotation that was what I thought. But now I realized that I was really trying to exchange the lightsquare bishops. Black's bishop on e4 is pinned to the rook on h7. It's been more than a year between when I played this and when I annotated it.)} Nf5 18. d5 exd5 19. Bxe4 dxe4 20. Nd2 {I have rid the board of black's pesky light square bishop, but at what price? Note the weaknesses I left open at d4 and e5.} O-O-O 21. O-O g4 {And now here's where it gets ugly: Black's pawns and pieces are slowly advancing towards my king, and the majority of my own pieces rest on the queenside, attacking nothing and defending nothing.} 22. Kh2 Ne5 {Also note the weakness in my position at d3.} 23. Rfe1 Rd3 24. Qa2 {At least here I could have gotten my queen closer to the kingside with Qd1, but instead I insist on defending my useless a and c pawns.} gxh3 {Note the now-open g file.} 25. Rxe4 hxg2 26. Rf4 Qd7 27. Kxg2 Rg7+ 28. Kf1 Rh3 29. Ke2 {At least Ke1 here would have avoided the check from black's queen.} Qd3+ {I resigned, Since kd1 is checkmate from one of the rooks and king e1 will lead to rook check, knight block, rook takes knight checkmate. I guess the main lesson from this game is to defend where and when you know you're being attacked and to put your pieces in a position where they can move and defend.} 30. Kd1 Rg1# {}
