1. f4 {bird opening} d5 2. c4 {Sturm gambit} e6 3. cxd5 Nf6 {living the e pawn to take, irresistible temptation ! Then, black will stay with a BIG HOLE in the center.} 4. dxe6 Bxe6 {2 pieces out, but no center. It will be easy to develop for white. } 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. e3 {preventing Nd4} Bd6 7. a3 {preventing N o B b4 before to adva} O-O 8. Be2 Re8 9. O-O a6 10. d4 Bd5 11. Nc3 {Now we are ready for fight ! In order to place the f3 knight in e5 to provoke an exchange and open f colon retaking with f4, i need to take first the lsb to prevent a dangerous sacrifice in g2} Ne7 {preparing attack on the e3 weak pawn} 12. Nxd5 Nexd5 {so i have to defend e3, or cancel one of the two threats. I will choose this last option in order to go n developing my plan (open f colon ...etc.)} 13. Ne5 Qe7 {will place the f6 knight in e4, then advance f7 to kick my e5 knight and go on on his plan (attack e3)} 14. Bf3 {so preventing Ne4} Rad8 {has he supposed that i would like to retake with d4 in case on exchanging my e5 knight ?? This look like a lost tempo...} 15. Qb3 {double threat on d5 knight, pursuing to attack f7} c6 16. Bd2 Qc7 17. Rac1 {i will win the d5 knight if black exchange dsb with my e5 knight...} Bxe5 {exchanging} 18. fxe5 {retaking, and now the f6 knight protector of d5 has to move !} Rxe5 {oh ! what a nice calculation ! black is -3 anyway,  and this was the best option in order to not to break the king castle. But this is ignoring the fact that two rook together are much more powerful, and even more in endings games....} 19. dxe5 Qxe5 20. Bxd5 {to get out the f6 knight in order to threaten f7} Nxd5 21. Ba5 {i plan to sacrifice my knight : 21. Ba5 b6  22. Bxb6 Kd5xb6 23.Qxf7+ Kh8 24.Qf8+ Rd8xf8 25.Rf1xf8#} Re8 {accurate dodge } 22. Bb6 {still provoking exchange with d5 knight ...If not i will anchor my dsb on d4} Nf6 {still accurate answer} 23. Bd4 {pressuring the queen to provoke mistake} Qg5 {this is the mistake i was searching ...placing my rook on f3 it will become very dangerous for black (taking the black knight with my dsb, black to retake with the g7 pawn, opening the g colon, then the rook goes to g3 and win the queen !)} 24. Rf3 {Re8 e6 was called...} Qg6 {but not, the game is done in 3 moves} 25. Bxf6 {1} gxf6 {2} 26. Rg3 {3 ! I hope you've enjoyed.}
