1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O {My favorite time control 3 minutes + 10 seconds so you have to think quickly. ( Sometimes I see things well and sometimes I should resign early ).  This position is pretty common. } Nf6 5. d3 {The d3 move is the best way to defend the pawn. On 5. Nc3 Black has the option of 5. ..., Nxe4 6. Nxe4, d5 forking the knight and the bishop and getting an easy game.  } h6 6. Be3 Bxe3 7. fxe3 {White does have doubled pawns but the half open f file and the possible support for d4 should compensate. } O-O 8. Nc3 Na5 9. Bb3 Nxb3 10. axb3 {Black gets the bishop for knight trade and the position looks rather bland still white can play d4 anytime. } d6 11. d4 exd4 {This undoubles white's pawn and gives him a broad pawn center.  Re8 was probably better threatening to take and win the pawn on e4.} 12. exd4 a6 13. Kh1 Re8 14. Qd3 {Defending a pawn with the queen is usually a bad idea - tying down your most powerful piece to guard a pawn but the rook on a1 will pick the guard duties and centralizing the queen is not bad. } Bg4 15. Rae1 Re7 {This move makes Nh4 possible later.  Before black played Re7 white could not play Vh4 since Nxe4 would win a pawn to due the fact that the black queen can capture on h4. } 16. h3 Bh5 17. Nh4 Qd7 {Black should just play the rook back to e8 so the queen can defend the knight on f6 Back is open to a tactical trick. } 18. Nf5 Ree8 {Re6 would stop the tactical trick temporarily but white can play d5 and still win the pawn.} 19. Nxh6+ {If Black captures the knight then his knight on f6 hangs to the rook.  } Kh7 20. Nf5 Bg6 21. Qg3 {White is thinking about possible avenues of attack with the strong knight on f5} Bxf5 22. Rxf5 {Black takes the knight off but the heavy pieces are getting involved.  White had to look at Qxf5 to see if black could get two rooks for the queen luckily ( and it was lucky ) the queen on g3 guard the rook on e1. } Nxe4 {A mistake.  Black wants to remove the guard on the rook at f5 and if white simply takes the knight he lose the rook to the queen.  however there is an in between move.} 23. Rh5+ Kg8 24. Nxe4 Qe6 {Black pins the knight hoping to regain the piece.  } 25. Qh4 {The threat is mate and the f pawn must move to avoid mate.} f5 {This works out badly but f6 is not much better. on 25. ..., f6 there is 26. Rh8ch, Kf7  27. Qh5ch ( 27. ..., g6  28. Qh7 mate ) 27. ..., Ke7 28. Rxe8, Rxe8  29. Qxe8, Kxe8 30, Nxd6ch, cxd6 31. Rxe6ch and white is a full rook up.} 26. Rh8+ Kf7 27. Ng5+ {Black resigns.  }
