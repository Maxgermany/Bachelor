1. d4 Nf6 2. e3 {Non-commital, but solid} g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. c4 O-O 5. Be2 d6 6. O-O Nc6 7. Nc3 Bg4 8. h3 {Not a great move, and the one that Black was trying to induce with his slightly dubious Bishop sortie. It weakens the Kingside pawn structure and gives Black's light-squared Bishop a target at which to aim itself.} Bd7 9. Nh2 {? A move with no solid positional point.} e5 10. d5 Ne7 11. e4 {Now we have a fairly standard King's Indian pawn structure, and as such White should be trying to attack Black's Queenside, while Black will aim at White's King.} Ne8 12. f4 {?? An awful move. White has no good possibilities on the K-side, and taking the e-pawn will only give Black a monster square on e5 instead of a blocked and passive Bishop.} f5 {! The refutation.} 13. Bd3 fxe4 {!? Trying to open up the position and make his pieces more active. Also, this is pretty much the only way of convincingly demonstrating the wrongness of White's f4 push.} 14. Bxe4 exf4 15. Bxf4 Nf6 16. Bc2 Nf5 17. Bxf5 {? Waste of tempo.} Bxf5 18. a3 Re8 19. Nf3 {White, once again, has to redevelop his pieces to aim at the center. However, challenging the e-file with 19. Re1! was the only way for White to hold on.} Ne4 20. Nxe4 Rxe4 21. Qc1 {Forced.} Re2 {Once again, ganging up on the b-pawn, which White will have to go through some contortions to save.} 22. Nd2 Qe7 {Doubling on the e-file and for the moment stopping the c5 push.} 23. Ra2 {Kind of a pointless move, but it is hard to suggest anything to White at this point.} Re8 24. b4 {Too little, too late. White hits upon the correct idea of advancing his Q-side pawns, but Black dominates in the center far too much for this to end any way but painfully.} Bd4+ 25. Kh2 {? 25. Kh1! would have prevented the Black Queen from joining the attack with tempo.} Qh4 26. Nf3 {?? A blunder, but White was lost anyway. After 26. Rf3 Black had prepared 26...Rxg2+ 27. Kxg2 Re2+ 28. Kf1 Rf2+ 29. Kg1 Rxf3+ with mate soon after.} Qxh3# {This game illustrates the fact that, although you may have a pawn center in a closed or semi-closed position, often the best course of action is not to attempt an attack on the K-side. Also, when the character of a position changes and becomes more open, centralization often leads to an unstoppable attack when ignored.}
