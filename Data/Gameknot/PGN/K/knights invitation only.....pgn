1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 {I decided to play slow I guess lol} b5 6. Bb3 Be7 7. c3 O-O 8. O-O d6 9. Re1 Na5 10. Bc2 {My B will be happy here.} c5 {=} 11. Bg5 h6 12. Bh4 Bg4 13. Nbd2 g5 14. Bg3 Nh5 {?!  The computer begs for this move a few tempo ago but now it's too late.} 15. h3 Be6 {I'm aiming at 7 central squares vs his 3.  So let's open up his k-side.......} 16. Nxe5 {If he replies dxe5 I get active with the obvious 17.Qxh5 +/- or even 17.Bxe5} Nxg3 17. Nxf7 Rxf7 18. fxg3 {Computer says -/+ worse than 2 pawns behind.} Qd7 {A distraction.} 19. Kh2 Raf8 {Computer suggests 19...g4 and that certainly would have been annoying.  20.Qh5 is already showing up in the computer.  Later on I see it.} 20. Nf3 {?  I moved my K to h2 knowing that ...Bxh3 was annoying but I got blind to the result of .gxh3 Rxf3 and how the g-pawn protector of the f3 N is gone.  Thankfully he missed it too.} g4 21. hxg4 Bxg4 22. Rf1 c4 {Computer considers this bad.  Probably should have maintained pressure on K-side I guess.  Anyway it's annoying counterplay.  Also computer wanted me to reply 23.b4 or d4.} 23. Qd2 {I'm starting to see his open K-side so let's counter attack.  Do or die time!!} Rh7 24. d4 Bxf3 25. gxf3 Qe8 26. Kg2 Qh5 27. f4 Rg7 28. Qd1 {Computer says I'm almost back to even as of a few moves ago.  I foiled his threat and built my own attack with initiative.  But the text move is wimpy, slow and clunky.  Qe3 or even Bd1 would have been better.} Qg6 29. Qf3 Bh4 30. Kh3 {??  30...Bxg3 will still work.  Computer says 31.e5 (don't get it) Qxc2 32.Qxg3 Rxg3+ 33.Kxg3 Kh7 34.Rg1 Qxb2 chasing me around with checks and captures.  But he missed it too lol.} Be7 31. Rac1 {Sets up possible e5 with discovered attack on his Q} Nc6 32. e5 Qe8 33. Be4 Nd8 34. Bd5+ Kh8 35. b3 {Wasn't sure about this move.  It's pointless when you've already got a k-side attack and initiative is so important.  Anyway, computer doesn't like it but he played in to it so he was obviously distracted by it.  Mission accomplished.} cxb3 36. axb3 Nf7 {!  Sets up a possible fork on g5.  In hind-sight I should have taken his N sooner.} 37. b4 dxe5 38. Bxf7 {Not dxe5 because 38...Ng5+!! is an obvious fork but also initiates a discovered attack on my Q if I reply with the natural fxg5.  Also watch that his h-pawn is doing absolutely nothing.} Rfxf7 39. dxe5 Bf8 40. Rcd1 Qe6+ 41. Kh2 Qf5 42. Rd8 Qc2+ 43. Rf2 Qb3 {?  Takes his Q out of action.  Computer says clear advantage white and he never recovers.} 44. f5 Kg8 45. Rxf8+ {Analyze this.  Trying to smother his K but the simple pawn advance would have been quicker and still keep that R so inaccurate.  But he makes a few mistakes and I capitalize.  He who makes the last mistake loses lol.  The position begged for certain tactics that reminded me of those puzzles that I loath.  But I guess they pay off.} Rxf8 46. f6 Rgf7 47. Qg4+ Kh7 48. Qf5+ Kh8 49. Rf4 Qb2+ 50. Kh3 Qxc3 {?  He should have chased my K around with something like 50...Qa1 threatening ...Qh1 but I'm not convinced he realized how strong my threat was.} 51. Rh4 Rg8 {??  Forced mate in 2.  Even 51...Rh7 would have been technically better.  He resigned on my next fatal move.} 52. Rxh6+ {}
