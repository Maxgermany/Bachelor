1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 3. exd5 e4 4. d3 Nf6 5. dxe4 Nxe4 6. Nf3 {The other main alternative here for white is to play Be3 allowing Qh4+ g3 Nxg3 and Nf3. I chose Nf3 as I wanted to explore these lines as I'm more likely to play this Over The Board.} Bc5 {If c6 then white plays Nbd2 trades pieces and gives the pawn back in exchange for a strong initiative. If Bf5 or another wasteful move then I'll grab the a7-g1 diagonal with Be3.} 7. Qe2 Bf5 {Why not Bf2+ ? Well after Kd1 Qxd5 Nfd2 and white is going pile pieces onto the fixed knight probobaly winning a pawn and maybe some kind of Qh5+ Ideas as f5 is pretty forced.} 8. Nc3 Qe7 9. Be3 {Still all theory, at this point black has a choice of 2 directions to go, NxNc3 which allows Bxc5 Nxe2 Bxe7 Nxf4 Ba3 and white will be a pawn down but have the bishop pair and a lead in development. I was very happy to go into this if my opponent allowed it.} Bxe3 {Now a couple of forced moves} 10. Qxe3 Nxc3 11. Qxe7+ Kxe7 12. bxc3 {This is the Critical position to analayze and one in which I was extremely happy to find myself in as It allowed me to play it out rather than the "This is according to the players who are far better than I'll ever be... a win for white". As it turns out it is a rather easy position to play with white and it kind of plays itself.  Black is a pawn down, he will regain this pawn its inevitable. However he will lose at least a move in doing so. If we can couple this with the weak position of his king black is starting to look rather shaky. White is going to exploit it and the bishop to speed up his position to allow him time to grab space on the kingside.    } Bxc2 {Alternative is Bd4 Ng5 and after Bxd5 white plays 0-0-0 with tempi the black king is going to be abused.} 13. Kd2 {Kick the bishop freeing up the e file for the rook.} Bf5 14. Re1+ {Develop a piece with tempi.} Kf6 15. Nd4 Rd8 {With hindsight this can't be right. white has a threat of Re5 or maybe Nxf5 that must be answered. Surely Bd7 here is strongest of a bad bunch.} 16. Re5 {Asking the question, where does the bishop go ?} Bg6 {Seems like a natural and only place kind of move. If white plays h4 threatening h5 for the bishop I have time for h6 Bh7...} 17. g4 {Ouch, a little sting in the tail that my opponent missed with all the other bad options out there, now there is pawn g5 mate to worry about and no real good way of navigating through it.} h6 {Pretty much forced, if Bc1 then I have ideas g5+ Kg6 then ideas of Be2 Bxa2 Bd3+ and something has got to happen for white, be it g6 discovered checks or mating ideas on the black king.} 18. h4 Bb1 19. Bh3 {Rather than Bd2 as this allows me to take the knight in some lines if he tries Nd7 to kick my rook.} c5 20. g5+ {Charge} Kg6 {Now we have a series of forcing moves.} 21. h5+ Kh7 22. Rxb1 {Now the king is safer however I have achieved my plan from move 12, I have used the weak king and loose pieces to obtain a strong advantage and kingside space. at this point I'm looking for the knockout punch and it comes in the form of a standard tactical idea.} cxd4 23. Rxb7 {No point wasting time recapturing on d4.} dxc3+ 24. Kxc3 Kg8 {f5 and f6 are met with gxf6 and Rf8 just transposes.} 25. Ree7 {2 Rooks on the seventh are hugely powerful and this position is no exception.} Rf8 26. g6 Na6 27. gxf7+ {Now there are possibilitys of closing in the king completely with Bf5-g6.} Kh8 28. Rbxa7 Rac8+ {The game was lost anyway at this point. This was a nice little theoretical game from both sides with the sneaky mating idea of g4-g5 being blacks undoing.} 29. Bxc8 {}
