1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nbd2 a6 {I'd say a weak move, but true is that white has a game going on with Bb5 followed by BxN and Ne5.} 5. e3 Bg4 {This IS a waste of a move, it just helps me in my developement (which foresees a pawn storm on the Kside).} 6. h3 Bh5 7. g4 Bg6 8. c3 {Stop, this is necessary here in order to prevent Nb5. 8. Ne5 prevents it, but kind of "discovers the cards" too soon. It's better to let the opponent the chance to go on with "second best" moves!... :-)} e6 {This is the most sensible move. Not any sensible player would go for b5 at once... ;-)} 9. Ne5 Nxe5 {He choses to exchange it. Better thand Nd6, useless while the pawn can retake supported by the B. The only thing I didn't comment: Here, black seems to own the white squares, and he does... but while my N is in d2, I have nothing to fear: a black N in e4 doesn't bother me too much, I can go on attacking. If the B goes there, I'll exchange it. That's in theory. } 10. dxe5 Ne4 {Here, I CAN play Nf3. If black removes his N to c5 (in order to let his lsb come to e4), I'll have time to move my R away from the pin, and then play calmly Ng5, and black has to retire it or have it exchanged. After Bg6 I would control e4 with my own lsb...} 11. h4 {...but I went for this, instead. The idea is that black's lsb has to find shelter in h7, blocking the R's action on the h file...(of course, my move is also preventing Qh4...)} Nxd2 {...and then there is this. I hate this, because the MOST SENSIBLE move is... KxN. Because my Q has to stay on the light squares, ready to go to a4+ or supporting the K's pawnstorm... But of curse, my K will be exposed, and if black finds c5 at once... I can die quickly and sadly. So I saw leaks on my "preparation", up to this point... and, sigghing, I played...} 12. Qxd2 Be4 {Now black can really occupy the e4 square, and I have no N to exchange it. Bad thing. } 13. Rh2 {I have to guard h4, of course. } Bc5 {No, black, no, you had to play c5. I always play c5, it's "always" good against the London, and it's basic chess principles (this time they do work!). Now, I can't say I made my point on the opening if I don't get some kind of compensation, attack or something. } 14. Bg5 {I try to bother him and force to open the game before he safely castles queenside. } Be7 {Probably the best. At least, I made it for a tempo, now... if I retire my B, I'll lose h4, and if I let it there, I'll lose a pawn in g5... Of course, the easy way is BxB, with an equal game... and a not very interesting one (except for large, strategic endgames, which I adore, but not on blitz!).} 15. f4 {...and this was the other one. I know, will take care of his lsb later. I have to cause him to react...} Bxg5 {Well! One of the best possible outcomes for me. } 16. hxg5 {My pawns can become a potential threat.} c5 {Finally! Ok, I expected it any moment. Now, a classical way is o-o-o, but it povokes black's fury. The hidden threat will come later, with Bb6, threatening e3, which had become very weak. I dared to play f4 just because no N or dsb are left on the black side. I sensed it was not wise to let him play it undisturbed. } 17. c4 {Do you like it?} f6 {? I think e4 by black would have crushed me... anyway...} 18. cxd5 exd5 19. gxf6 gxf6 {I can't allow further exchanges if I don't get some advantage in return. Rh5, and if fxe5, Re6+, followed by Rxe5 sounds good, but black wouldn't necessarily fall for it. } 20. e6 {I think that if he doesn't play f5 at once, this pawn will prove to be brave. } Qb6 {...here, the obvious one was f5... returning the initiative to him! Never!} 21. Rh6 {A little trick... to keep the game interesting. } Qxe6 22. g5 {The real scope of this manouver is to allow my own lsb into the game.} Bg6 23. Bh3 {If Qe4, Bg2 winning the d5 pawn. } f5 {!? This is a very doubled edge move. It blocks his own lsb's influence, while I can get to g2 any time I want, making it very active. The R will have to spend some move, but if black's Q or lsb want to move, they have to calculate the consecuences at any move. It seems that I'm getting released, but it's not true. A hidden threat is coming after black castles. And I won't castle queenside now, with all his pawns coming... no way. } 24. Kf2 O-O-O 25. Rc1 b6 {Now, I felt I had the game in my hands. It's very easy to attack all those advanced pawns...} 26. Bf1 Kb7 27. Qd3 c4 28. Qa3 {On the agenda a triple attack on d5, but it won't succeed right now. } b5 {I'd say a bad choice. IF I played b3, then ok, but now?} 29. Bg2 {I'm not sure about Qf5... it was wery easy to kick, so I need more pressure. If Qa5, Qb6 and the Q's exchange slowens down my attack. } Rhe8 {Well done, increasing pressure on the e column. Time to reinforce my own pressure...} 30. Rd1 {I know that if he moves his K away from the diagonal, d4 would become a strong move for black. But... which square should the BK go? Not so easy!...} Kb6 {Good, controlling c5. But...} 31. b4 {What I am really threaten is... nothing. I'm just preventing him from playing his own attack, d4. Shall black do?} d4 {No, he could't. I did. Now, it's mate in two. Can you see it? :-)} 32. Qa5+ Ka7 33. Qc7# {I probably deserved to lose, but I could keep my opp too busy to realize it! :-)}
