[Opening "English opening (A16)"]

1. c4 {I don't know really how to play against an English opening, so I went for a standard developement plan, exploiting the black diagonal with a fianchetto.} Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O {Being the c pawn still in c7, it is not difficult to control the white's lsb.} 5. e4 d6 {Preventing an early e5, that can be annoying. c6 makes sense, too, fighting for the center (e6, d5). But I didn't want to keep my pieces undeveloped because of f4 and a possible early attack on my kingside.} 6. Nge2 {Clearly aiming to f4. } c5 {White doesn't seem to want to play e4, so it's time to get some control of the center. } 7. O-O Nc6 8. d3 Bd7 {Standard moves right now. I hate to develop bishops on d7 or e7, since they seem very inactive, there. But I had no choice. I don't want to play e6 because I don't want to trap my own bishop, so unless it becomes unavoidable, I won't do it. } 9. h3 {Just a profilactic move, nobody is taking initiative. I don't see a real plan. White still has f4, but probably he is waiting for me to go somewhere so he can play the knight or the bishop to f4, instead.  But in doing so, he is weakening the kingside, unnecessarily, since neither the knight or the bishop are doing anything in g4...} Qc8 {The normal developement would have been Qc7, but I eyed something against the weak h3 - } 10. Kh2 {now, with the white king in h2, white must think about attacking quickly, or I'll do. } a6 {It was difficult for me to go on. Maybe h5 would have been the right attacking move. With the played move, I was looking for a surprising future b5, but in doing so, I left the white knight a wonderful outpost on a4-b6. } 11. Be3 {White doesn't seem to want to take advantage of it, so the game proceeds in a - not clear what to do fashion, and begins to be "squeezed".} Ne5 {I am trying to bring my pieces over the kingside, and preparing b5.  Now, if white plays f4, I can try Ng5 as a dubious sac, or he wins two tempoes. } 12. Bf4 {As suspected, white is not considering interesting pawn in f4 - a mistake, I think. } h5 {Ok, I must do "something"... let's attack, then!} 13. Bg5 {Despite all my good intentions, I couldn't see a good sac yet. Not without a rook on h1. And no way to get there easily.  Bxh3 (BxB, Nf3+ and...?), or Ng5+, hxN... what? Maybe Qxg5 could have given me something, but in order to play it I must have taken the bishop out of the way... White's move IS a loss of tempo, after Bf4 (?) } Bc6 {This is useless, just a loss of tempo. Since I didn't dare to sac, I had to proceed somehow. } 14. Nf4 {I think white should have played f5 here. If I don't have a break, he must search for it. } b5 {This move is just to gain some space, but my aim is to use the inactive a rook in order to defend the e7 pawn. I don't want to move the pawn because I want to keep the diagonal free for my queen as long as possible, but Nf6 is "blocked" because Bxe7, then Bxd6 would be nasty moves. And Re8 seems weird, since sooner or later the f column will play a role in all this, for sure. } 15. cxb5 axb5 {Not Bxb5 because of Nxb5. I don't want to lose my bishop because I feel it has a lot of squares to be useful.} 16. a3 {As foresee, and I have tempo to play...} Ra7 {Now a trap is set for white, involving the unfortunate position of the dsb. But he didn't see it. } 17. Re1 {A sad decision. Probably white is thinking about d4 - a good option to open the game a little. But it didn't consider the tactic I have.} Nh7 {Now, the only way not to lose a piece seems: h4, but f6. Then 19. Bh3, Ng5+ (queen is threatened)... you see, a little tactic here. But white plays the other move, that just plainly loses a piece. } 18. Bh4 g5 19. Nxh5 {I didn't see anything clearly dangerous in Qxa5, but I think it would have been stronger - at least the white queen would be into the fight. } gxh4 20. gxh4 {I think NxB and Rg1 are clearly better.  Now, I am only +1, but white pawns on the h column are sad. Anyway: be careful, because the g column is open to him, and my king is just behind.  I don't have a clear win just now, but I knew I didn't want to lose my dsb, and Bh8 is really dangerous. So...} Bh6 {Controlling the knight and a good long diagonal. } 21. Ne2 {White position needed aggressivenes, this kind of passive move has its purposes, but is just slow. Ok, it supports f4 or Nf4. But Rg1, or d4... I don't know, really :-)} Ng6 {Fightin for f4, but most of all threatening h4...} 22. Kg3 {Lose h4 would have been better. But it is easy to say it now. } f5 {I realized I had to open the game, since my pieces were lacking freedom. With the white king exposed, it must be good for me anyway.} 23. Nef4 {Looking for exchanges in order to loosen the position. } Nxf4 24. Nxf4 e5 {This is very nice. Because now my a7 rook is coming into the game!} 25. Nd5 {I thought about BxN, exB, Bf4+. It souds very strong, because the king cannot go to h2. Kf6, e4+... ok, but I didn't see a clear win, so I decided that to open the f column will be the key (remember my comment about the importance of the f column).} Rg7+ 26. Kh2 fxe4 27. dxe4 {Rxe4, BxN, and Bxe4, Rxf2+, then Qxh3 (you see, not to play e6 was a good decision...)} Rxf2 {Rooks are raining...} 28. Rg1 Bf4+ {If NxB, the correct move to win is Bxe5!} 29. Kh1 {It allows a simple but spectacular tactic} Qxh3+ 30. Bxh3 Rh2# {}
