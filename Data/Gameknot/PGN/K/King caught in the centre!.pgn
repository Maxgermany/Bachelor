1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  This unrated game was between myself and Walking the Walk & Learning to Run newbie, Pawnish53 (Joe).  Joe has also only just joined gameknot and has so far played only 5 games, hence his low rating.  At the conclusion of his next game he will be issued with his provisional rating and an actual after his 20th.  So, I was playing an unknown quantity.  So, would King Henry end up being caught in the centre?  Well, you will just have to read on to find out.  I start with the Reti Opening.} d5 2. d4 {2. d4 - first two moves follow my consultation game v Ipissimus (Martin), but black will deviate from this on his next turn.} Nc6 3. g3 Bf5 {3. …… Bf5 - although this game does look as though it is transposing into the Ipissimus game, g3 has already been played and I will follow up on the next turn with Bg2.  This was one of the suggested moves in the Ipissimus game so it will be interesting to see what the follow up is gonna be.} 4. Bg2 e6 5. a3 {5. a3 - stopping Nb4 or Bb4+.} Nf6 6. O-O {6. 0-0 - Henry gets out of the centre - umph!} Bd6 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 {8. …… Qxf6 - B for N trade.  Black now has the option of castling queenside or kingside.  On the next turn King Joe chooses queenside.  So, is it really possible for a king to be stuck in the centre post-castling?  We shall see.} 9. c3 O-O-O 10. Nbd2 {10. Nbd2 - Glenda looks particularly innocuous on d1, wouldn't you agree?  Looking at her you would never believe that she is capable of creating mayhem in the opposition camp, would you now?} Qg6 {10. ….. Qg6 - right now it is the BQ that looks the more threatening and there is every hint of a kingside pawn storm.  However, I see the opportunity of ridding black of his strong light square bishop.} 11. Nh4 Qh7 12. Nxf5 Qxf5 {13. Nf3 - the seed of a plan to attack black's queenside is beginning to germinate in my head - first there will be a couple of Petrosianesque type knight manoeuvres which look a bit silly but will lull my opponent into a false sense of security.} 13. Nf3 g5 14. Ne1 {14. Ne1 - merely preparing a queen trade but black chooses to keep the queens on.  Is that wise?  We shall see.} Rdf8 15. Qd3 Qf6 16. e4 {16. e4 - I remember, long, long, ago a game against a very strong Expert called Heinzkat in which I lost on Move 52.  My rating was in the 1500s at the time.  Heinzkat pointed out that I had the opportunity to make a crucial pawn break e4 but failed to take it and I had condemned myself to the all too familiar passivitis.  So, I play e4.  This will lead to me getting a strong pawn centre.  In fact, I am now threatening to win a pawn by exd5, exd5, Bxd5.} dxe4 17. Qxe4 Ne7 {17. ….. Ne7? - GASP!! here is the error - it loses a pawn and allows Glenda a decisive penetration into black's position!} 18. Qxb7+ {18. Qxb7+ - ZAP!} Kd7 {18. …… Kd7 - and King Joe is forced into the centre!} 19. Qxa7 {19. Qxa7 - KPOW!! } Nc8 20. Qa4+ Ke7 21. Qc2 {21. Qc2 - Glenda hides herself from possible rook attack but not for long!} h5 22. Qe4 g4 {22. …… g4 - the much anticipated pawn storm is coming but that is as far as it gets.} 23. c4 {23. c4 - threat - c5 winning Joe's bishop.} Kd8 24. Rd1 {24. Rd1 - the storm clouds over black's position are starting to gather.} Rfe8 25. c5 {25. c5 - forcing black to clear a discovery line right through to his king!} Be7 26. b4 c6 {26. …… c6? - So Joe gives Glenda another pawn to turn into dust - wowee!} 27. Qxc6 Rhg8 {27. ….. Rhg8 - still thinking about attacking Henry's castled position.  In the meanwhile a familiar dark dark shadow is moving ever closer to King Joe - that's right, our Chessic Grim Reaper Old Matey is not that far away.} 28. d5 e5 29. d6 {29. d6!! - Now I decline the queen trade and with good reason.  Qd7# is threatened on the next turn.  Joe can only avoid it with ruinous loss of material.  Can you see how?  Time to set the conditionals.} Bf8 {29. ….. Bf8 - black prefers euthanasia.} 30. Qc7# {30. Qc7# - Qc7 MATE!! - Now that bolt of lightening comes from those storm clouds and strikes down King Joe.  It's so amazing that black's queenside castled position has been completely destroyed.  Three oversights caused King Joe to lose vital pawns around his castled position and drove his king back into the centre.  After that my queen made full use of the open lines at her disposal to snare King Joe.  I think I can now safely say ……. 'Ware Glenda!!}
