1. e4 {Since I didn't start annotation until the 3rd move, allow me to say RUY LOPEZ. Let's see if he transposes to keep me unawares. This should be fun, hopefully I can hang with the lad!! I meant to play the Fried Liver, but that would have been Bc4 not Bc5, oh well maybe next time} e5 {Standard play} 2. Nf3 {Standard stuff} Nc6 {The opening is almost identified.} 3. Bb5 {It's official - Ruy Lopez! Black's main choices are; Steinitz, Cozio, Berlin, Bird, Classical, Schliemann, and let's not forget Morphy. There are of course a slew of less traveled roads. Personally, Morphy's Defense would be cool. Let's see what blacks does! } a6 {Awesome!! Morphy's Defense indeed. White must tread carefully.} 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Qf6 6. d4 Bd6 7. Bg5 Qe6 8. Re1 Nf6 9. Nc3 O-O 10. dxe5 {Things are heating up now!}
