1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 c6 3. Nf3 d5 {black takes a strong stance to wrestle control of the middle board early.} 4. exd5 cxd5 5. Bb5+ Nc6 6. Nxe5 {with the N pinned, white is able to pick off an early P. white must be careful, though, since 6....Qe7 can prove deadly if not played incorrectly.} Bd7 {releases the pin and attacks the lone N.} 7. Qh5 {black has several options...he can play 7....NxN 8.BxB+ QxB 9.QxN+ Qe7 (blocking with the bB loses to 10.QxPg ...thus losing a R and K-side structure, and blocking with the remaining N will force black to expend extra moves to castle K-side if he wishes to go that route) 10.QxQ BxQ 11.0-0 Nf6 12.d4 0-0, with white up a P, but even chances for both.} Qf6 {this aggressive response forces white to initiate trading such that black must respond to white. in the process though, white can make it uncomfortable for black to castle Q-side, meaning black must now empty his K-side before castling.} 8. Nxc6 bxc6 9. Qe2+ Be7 {black sacrifices future N positioning so that he may castle sooner. sometimes a temporary N on the edge is better than wasting time trying to optimize piece development.} 10. Ba4 Nh6 11. c3 {white determines that he has time yet to castle, so he expands his control of the board while simultaneously blocking off black's bB major lines of attack.} O-O 12. d4 Rfe8 {NOW would be a very good time for white to castle since black's next move is a discovered pin on his Q against his K. } 13. O-O {white could also have played 13.Bc3, preventing the Q pin in the first place while keeping the option open to castle Q-side. white should prefer NOT to castle Q-side since black has an open b-lane with which he could create a battery and form an attack on the castled K. white would have difficulty defending against this since his own b2-d4 pawn line would be a barrier against bringing in supporting help in such a situation. therefore, if white should castle K-side, now is the best time.} Bd6 {expected...black is forcing white to respond.} 14. Qd3 Re4 15. Nd2 Rg4 {black is deftly moving pieces into attacking position. at this point black has 5 attacking pieces trained to the k-side of the board. white should be defeated soon....} 16. Nf3 Rg6 {black had no justification retreating the R. keeping the pressure on white, better is 16....Bf5 17.Qe3 Bf4 18.Qe2 Be4 19.BxB QxB 20.Bd1 ...this ties up white's Q, B, and N freeing black's N and remaining R an opportunity to join the fray.} 17. Ne5 {forks the R and wB. black must respond.} Bxe5 18. dxe5 {white has now removed one of the attackers from the K-side of the board.} Qh4 {black repositions his Q for the assault. if 18....QxPe, then 19.f4 Qh5 20.Bd1 Qh4 , and white begins to push back.} 19. Bxh6 {white takes the opportunity to remove another attacker.} Qxh6 {better is 19....RxPh 20.h3 (forced or 20...QxPh++) Rg6 , and now black threatens to play 21....BxP, since the g pawn is pinned.} 20. f4 {white creates much needed space, supports the e-pawn, and gives the f-rook breathing room.} Bh3 21. Rf2 Qh5 22. g3 Bf5 23. Qd2 Rc8 24. Qd4 Be4 25. Qe3 {white should be concerned with how many Q moves he is making.} Qh3 {with white's Q and R positioning, there is no immediate threat by black.} 26. Bc2 {white goes after the last attacking minor piece.} Re8 27. Bxe4 dxe4 28. Qxe4 f5 {while this move attacks white's Q, it also creates a past pawn that black must deal with.} 29. Qc4+ {someone once said ..."when in doubt, put him in check."} Rge6 {black voluntarily pins his own R. better is 29....Kh8, especially considering what his next plan is.} 30. Rd1 {white does nothing more than grab the open file.} Kh8 {a move late. initiative is beginning to swing white's way.} 31. b4 Qg4 32. Rdd2 h5 33. a4 h4 34. Rd7 {white times the advancement of the R to the 7th rank so that black is already committed to the h-pawn attack, which black should gain a pawn out of while creating 2 converging Rs on the g7 pawn, if he's lucky.} hxg3 35. hxg3 Re6xe5 {black risks it all by trading a R for a P. if black was to take a pawn at all, it should have been the pawn at g3, because then he could have forced a draw if he so desired (with the Q bouncing between e1 and h4, checking white's K).} 36. Rh2+ {black has one intercession, and resigns.}
