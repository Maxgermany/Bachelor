[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 {Best by test, as Fischer says.} d6 {Looks like a standard Pirc defense.  I usually try to open with a large center and push the d or e-pawn to rank 5 against this turtlish opening.} 2. d4 f5 {What??  This move moved me quite a bit.  Being unfamiliar with the so-called "Balogh Defense," irregular as it might be, I played conservatively over the next few moves until the position could even out.} 3. f3 {3. Qh5+ g3 or 3. exf5 Bxf5 4. Qh5+ g3/Bg3 both lead nowhere.} d5 4. Nc3 {Developing the knight and defending e4.  4. exd5 seemed playable but I wanted to migrate my f3 pawn to open my kingside and stay in the center.} dxe4 5. fxe4 Nc6 {Attacking d4.} 6. Nf3 {Defending it and closing off my queen from h5 for a second time.} Nf6 {Now all the cavalry are in play, but I have a strong pawn center and he has an open kingside.  What to do...} 7. d5 {if 7. e5 then 7. ...Ne4 is very troublesome.  e.g. 8. Nxe4 fxe4 and my d pawn falls.  8. Bd3 or Bd2 leave me cramped while his knight laughs at me.} Na5 {7. ...fxe4 8. dxc6 Qxd1 9. Kxd1 exf3 10. cxb7 Bxb7 or  8. Nxe4 Nxe4 9. dxc6 Qxd1 10. Kxd1 Nf2+    -/+ I got away with one there.} 8. Ne5 {8. e5 meets with Ne4 again.  I wanted to own the e8-h5 diagonal, even if I had to sacrifice some material.  I also tend to sacrifice more in blitz games; it's more fun that way.} fxe4 9. Nxe4 {!?  Deflecting his knight.} Nxe4 10. Qh5+ g6 11. Nxg6 Nf6 {! Time for a momentary retreat.} 12. Qh4 {Forced.} Rg8 13. Ne5 {13. Nf4 gives black solid initiative and blunts my attack.  Notice how dominant this knight is the rest of the game.} Qxd5 {Your sacrifice will not be in vain!} 14. Bf4 {Developing another piece and defending the knight.  Come on in, Queen!} Qe4+ {14. ...Nc6 would have left me very frustrated.  Instead, he took the bait.} 15. Be2 Qxg2 {Qxc2 may have been slightly better.  16. Bh5+ Nxh5 17. Qxh5+ Rg6 18. 0-0 Bg4! or 18. Nxg6 Qe4+ leaves black in an advantageous position.} 16. Bh5+ Nxh5 17. Qxh5+ Rg6 {Forced. 17. ...Kd8 18. 0-0-0+! and black is soon mated with Rxd7 and Qe8.} 18. O-O-O {Not 18. Nxg6 Qxh1+ 19. Kd2 Qg2+ with Qxg6 to follow and a massive lead for black  (19. ...Qxa1? is met by 20. Nf8+! Kd8 Qd5+ and perpetual check, since 20. ...Kxf8 is met by Bh6+ Kg8 Qe8#).} Bg4 {! A bolt of lightning!} 19. Qxh7 {Fleeing and maintaining a pressure on f7.} Bxd1 {?? Too greedy and now I have a forced mate.  Better was Rg7.} 20. Qf7+ Kd8 21. Qxf8# {And a beautiful checkmate made possible by the knight and queen dominating d7 and the e8-h5 diagonal.  It wasn't a perfect game, but it was certainly exciting.  I hope you enjoyed the razor-sharp play and maybe even learned a thing or two.}
