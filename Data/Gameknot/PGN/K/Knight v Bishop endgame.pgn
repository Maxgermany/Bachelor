1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is another knight endgame and this is going to be quite a marathon.  70 moves are to be played in this one.  Here is the gameknot analysis -enjoy!  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=26564274&fb=1&rnd=0.24557254462093247} e5 2. Bc4 {2. Bc4 - in response to a double king pawn opening we have the Bishop's Opening.} Bc5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. O-O Nf6 {4. .... Nf6 - both players bring out their pieces quickly.} 5. d3 d6 6. c3 {6. c3 - beginning to look like a Guicco Piano by transposition.} O-O 7. b4 Bb6 8. a4 a6 {8. ..... a6 - uh oh!  Better create a bolt hole for Fou Lenoir!} 9. Na3 Qe7 10. h3 Be6 {10. ..... Be6 - clearing the decks and preparing a bishop trade.} 11. Bb3 Bxb3 12. Qxb3 Rae8 13. Re1 Qe6 14. Qc2 {14. Qc2 - hmm - white declines a queen trade.  I smell a possible threat of Qxh7#  way way down the line.  I now play the prophylactic h6 to prevent a knight from landing on g5.} h6 15. Bb2 Ne7 16. Rad1 Ng6 {16. ..... Ng6 - that pin on the f2 pawn could be useful for a possible kingside mating attack from yours truly.  Maybe I could provoke a few weaknesses in white's castled position and that h3 pawn could suddenly become vulnerable if I can put my knight on f4 like I did in the Chorba game two annotations ago.  That game ended with Chorba copping Old Matey.} 17. Nc4 Ba7 18. Ncd2 Nf4 {18. .... Nf4 - nacht.} 19. Nf1 Nf6h5 20. Ne3 Qg6 {20. ...Qg6 - yup, just like the Chorba game only it is Glenda on g6 and not a rook.} 21. Kh1 Bxe3 {21.  .... Bxe3 - threatening mate on g2.} 22. fxe3 Ne6 23. Qf2 {23. Qf2 - the WQ defends.} Ng5 24. Nh4 Qh7 {24. .... Qh7 Glenda manoeuvres herself into a defensive position but not for long!} 25. Nf5 g6 26. Ng3 Nxg3+ 27. Qxg3 Ne6 28. c4 Ng7 {28. .... Ng7 - start of a regrouping.} 29. d4 f6 30. Qf2 g5 31. Qf3 h5 {31. ..... h5 - threatening to open up the WK by playing g4.} 32. Bc1 g4 33. Qg3 Qxe4 {33. ...... Qxe4 - Glenda comes out of hiding and turns white's e4 pawn into dust.  She also defends the pawn on g4.} 34. Qf2 gxh3 35. Kh2 hxg2 36. Qxg2 Qxg2+ 37. Kxg2 {37. Kxg2 - a queen trade but the plethora of exchanges are not over yet.  Notice that the mating attack has forced white to debunk 2 pawns.} exd4 38. exd4 Rxe1 39. Rxe1 Re8 40. Rxe8+ Nxe8 41. d5 Kg7 {41. Kg7 - we are now in a N v B endgame with me 2 pawns up but with still some work to do.} 42. Kf3 Kg6 43. Be3 f5 44. Ba7 b6 {44. .... b6 - trying to trap the white bishop but alas it does not succeed.} 45. a5 bxa5 46. bxa5 Kf6 47. Kf4 Kg6 {47. .... Kg6 - it looks as though I am going nowhere but with a 2 pawn advantage I am loathe to hit the offer draw button.  I will be patient and wait for white to make an error.} 48. Bf2 Nf6 49. Bh4 Ne4 50. Be1 {50. Be1 - I expected Bd8 leading to a queenside pawn trade.} Nc5 51. Bg3 Nd3+ 52. Kf3 f4 {52. .... f4 - I am prepared to give back one of my pawns to try and get white into a lost K&P ending.} 53. Bh4 Kf5 {53. ..... Kf5 - white chooses to keep the pieces on.  Henry now gives my passed pawn on f5 some support.} 54. Bd8 Ne5+ 55. Ke2 Nxc4 56. Bxc7 {56. .... Bxc7 - now the c pawns are traded off.  Henry is also eyeing up a white p(r)awn on d5.  I must remind you that prawns are Henry's special dish no matter on what platter and how they are served up.} Ke5 57. Kf3 Ne3 58. Bxd6+ Kxd6 59. Kxf4 Nxd5+ {59. ..... Nxd5+ - the white bishop is sacrificed to try and prevent my pawns reaching Glendadom.  However, there are still two black pawns on the board and only one white one.  I also have an extra piece.} 60. Kg5 Nc3 {60. ..... Nc3 - this knight will cut off the WK from approaching b1.} 61. Kxh5 Kc5 62. Kg4 Kb5 63. Kf3 Kxa5 {63. ..... Kxa5 - yum yum!} 64. Ke3 Kb4 65. Kd2 Kb3 {65. .... Kb3 - now Henry cuts off the WK from c2.  My a pawn is now has a clear run to Glendadom.} 66. Kc1 a5 67. Kd2 a4 68. Kc1 {68. Kc1 - it must be beginning to dawn on white that he cannot cut off my a pawn.} a3 69. Kd2 a2 70. Kd3 a1=Q {70....... a1/Q - However, with this move the mere sight of Glenda induces white to wave the white flag. I will have another endgame for you to peruse shortly.  Kind regards - Joanne}
