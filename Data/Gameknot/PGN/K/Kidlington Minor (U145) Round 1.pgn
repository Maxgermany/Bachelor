1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {My favourite response to the Caro Kann, as recommended by Vasilios Kotronias.} Bf5 4. Nc3 e6 5. g4 Bg6 6. Nge2 Bb4 {As featured in the first chapter of Kotronias's book, which suggests it's the line he considers least effective.  My memory of the detailed lines is vague but I've usually followed a policy of alternating pawn and minor piece moves over the next few moves, which hasn't served me particularly well.  In this game I concentrated on developing my pieces before launching too many pawns.} 7. Ng3 {This move protects e4 so that the pin on the Nc3 matters less and I can force Black's LSB back when I do attack it.} Ne7 8. Be3 {To discourage ...c5} Nd7 9. h4 h6 10. h5 Bh7 11. f4 {This feels risky from White's side of the board but probably feels frightening from Black's side!} Qc7 12. Rc1 c5 {Thematic in the Caro Kann as in the French and Sicilian.} 13. Bd3 {I'm not convinced that this is the right way to develop this bishop but it does swap off a piece in which Black has already invested several tempi...} Bxd3 14. cxd3 {It may seem odd to give myself doubled central pawns but the opening of the c-file is ample compensation and I felt confident that I could sort out my pawns fairly quickly.} cxd4 {Black cooperates in opening the c-file and sorting my pawns :-)} 15. Bxd4 Rc8 {and then pins my Nc3 again.} 16. a3 {I felt the need to force Black's hand at this point.} Bxc3+ 17. Rxc3 Qd8 18. Rxc8 Qxc8 {I felt I'd now neutralised Black's counter-play and would soon be able to resume my kingside pawn storm.} 19. Bc3 a6 {Not sure what the purpose of this was...} 20. O-O O-O 21. f5 exf5 22. gxf5 f6 23. exf6 Nxf6 24. Bxf6 Rxf6 25. Qg4 {The pawns on f5 and h5 exercise a powerful grip on Black's kingside but they also get in White's way.  White's king is also more exposed that Black's, but White's pieces are better poised to attack, so it's still a double-edged position.} Qc7 26. Ne2 {?! I felt afterwards that this was an error because it allowed Black's Q in to my position.  26. d4 would have prevented this but would have also prevented my N from using the d4 square.} Qe5 27. Nd4 Qe3+ 28. Kh2 Qxd3 29. Rg1 Rf7 30. f6 g5 {I had to think long and hard about whether to take en passant but eventually decided that a knight in the box was better value.} 31. fxe7 Rxe7 32. Qc8+ Kf7 33. Qf5+ {Now I'm material up, the aim is to increase the advantage by swapping off.} Qxf5 34. Nxf5 Re6 35. Rf1 {Black has two pawns for the knight, so it is still not an easy win.  White seeks to exploit the knight's capacity for trickery by threatening a double check.} Kg8 {which Black sidesteps.} 36. Kg3 b5 37. Rd1 Re2 {Now it's a question who can snaffle most pawns...} 38. Rxd5 Rxb2 39. Rd3 {I erred on the side of caution, bearing in mind that Black's next move would have forked K and a-pawn.  Not sure whether I could have grabbed the h6 pawn at this point.} b4 40. axb4 Rxb4 41. Ra3 Rb6 {Now both third rank pawns are defended.  I felt I'd missed something...} 42. Ne7+ Kf7 43. Nd5 Rb5 44. Nc7 Rb7 {Just when I thought I'd forced the win of the pawn, I realised that the pin of my N against my R could be fatal but eventually worked something out ...} 45. Nxa6 Ra7 46. Kg4 {? but this offered Black the opportunity to maintain the pin indefinitely.  46. Rf3+ was necessary.} Kf6 {?  If Black had played 46...Kg7, White's pieces would have been locked up as they stood.  Now White regains his freedom.} 47. Rf3+ Ke7 48. Nc5 Ra5 49. Ne4 {Now White's objective is to capture the h-pawn: Black's to prevent this.} Ra4 50. Kf5 Ra5+ 51. Kg4 Ra4 52. Re3 Ke6 {This would be stupid if White's N weren't pinned!} 53. Kf3 Kf7 54. Nd6+ Kf6 55. Re4 Ra3+ 56. Kg4 Ra1 {The start of a plan that loses for Black.. Joan put this down to lack of concentration when tired, though this was quite a quick game, timewise.} 57. Re3 {so that I can interpose R between the K and the checking R.} Rg1+ 58. Rg3 Rf1 59. Rf3+ {mission accomplished with check.} Rxf3 60. Kxf3 Ke6 61. Ne4 Kf5 62. Ng3+ {Black resigned, not waiting for the zugzwang to follow 62....K moves and 63. Kg4 followed by Nf5.}
