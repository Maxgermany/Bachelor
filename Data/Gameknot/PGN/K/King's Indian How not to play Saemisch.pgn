Understand I was experimenting with 3 moves against the Saemisch 6...e5; 6...c5; 6...c6: I was playing in the King Indian Defense mini-tournament. This move seems to pack a punch compared to the orthodox e5. Maybe, I do not know how to to play e5?} 7. Bd3 Qb6 {One of the main points of playing c6 or thee purpose.} 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. Nge2 a5 {A Quiet move} 10. O-O {?? Is he not suppose to play h5 or bishop h6. Attacking along the h file.} h5 {A waiting move. I still thought e5 was unnecessary } 11. f4 {??
