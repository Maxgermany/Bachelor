1. e4 {Hi everyone!  After losing my first game against Vlado playing white it was a pleasant surprise to get into a fine position against him playing black.  After 18 moves, I found myself a clear pawn up and with a much superior pawn structure until a combination of nerves and the need to make up rating points after a bad loss in the King Pawn Tournament led me to click on that Offer Draw button and convert my clear advantage to 6 rating points.  My opponent accepted and 6 rating points was what I got.  Here is how the action unfolds.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {3. Bb5 - the Ruy Lopez and one of Kasparov's favourites as the Spanish Torture.  White can bust up black's pawn structure at any time.} a6 4. Be2 {4. Be2 - an unusual retreat, normal is Ba4.} Nf6 {4. ...... Nf6 - development.} 5. Nc3 d5 {5. ...... d5 - pawn break.} 6. exd5 Nxd5 {6. ...... Nxd5 - pawn trade.} 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 {7. ........ Qxd5 - piece trade.} 8. O-O Bd6 {8. ...... Bd6 - after white castles I clear the line for doing likewise.  All very quiet so far but trust me there is about to be some action.} 9. d3 Nd4 10. Re1 {10. Re1 - lining up against Henry but I do go in for a B for N exchange on e2 all the same.} Nxe2+ 11. Qxe2 Bg4 {11. ....... Bg4 - developing and pinning the knight on f2 which is one of my e5 pawn's attackers.} 12. d4 {12. d4 - hits out at my pinned pawn but now I decide to trade B for N on f3.} Bxf3 13. gxf3 {13. gxf3 - strange, I expected Qxf3.  I would have then played Qxd4 and then if f4 then castles K.  If fxe5 then Re1 pinning the e5 pawn and keeping my pawn advantage.} Qxd4 {13. ....... Qxd4 - Glenda gleefully snaps up the loose d pawn.  At least with my developmental lead and being ready to castle on either side I can afford a little pawn grabbing here.} 14. c3 Qh4 {14. ...... Qh4 - after c3, asking Glenda where she wanted to go I chose h4.  It is not very often you see Glenda on h4 (if black) or h5 (if white), even less so against an Expert.} 15. f4 f6 {15. ...... f6 - defending my pinned e5 pawn.} 16. Qf3 O-O-O {16. ....... 0-0-0 - the Wicked Witch of the West is attacking b7.  Henry must therefore go queenside.} 17. fxe5 Bxe5 {17. ........ Bxe5 - pawn trade.} 18. h3 Qc4 {18. ....... Qc4 - and fearing that Glenda would be trapped I moved her to c5.  I then offered a draw and my opponent accepted.  In a post match pm, Jim Friar had this to say:-  "Well done. I preferred your position to his, although I didn't like your last move. He can play the check to swap off queens, but you have wasted a move by playing qc4....I thought g5...after check, then swap queens...then h5 to open the h file... That must be better for you."  Yes, I did briefly consider g5, that would have made h6 available to Glenda and then she could retreat to the bottom rank if she looked in danger of being trapped.  I suppose Vlado may well have exchanged queens to join his two kingside isolanis together.  Ah well, now that I can count on one hand how many Experts I have drawn against it is time to move up a gear and make my first Expert victory a new goal.  Hope you have had a good read everyone.  Bye for now.  Joanne  }
