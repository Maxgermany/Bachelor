1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 Bg7 4. d4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. b4 {also my favorite attack with white, but I'll face it from the other side.} Ne8 {I tryed many things I didn't know on this tournament. this is one of the main defenses, planning to counter-attack on the king side.} 10. c5 {maybe too soon? Why not a4 first?} h6 {this prepares g5 (move 12)} 11. Qc2 {slow, i suppose, as we'll see.} f5 {allready on full speed... Black is now better on attack, due to slow motion Qc2 and previous move.} 12. Rb1 {Well, I am not sure... I think I would have faced the case with a h3-Nh2 combo.} g5 {the whole idea is that i feel safe about exf that would be a terrible mistake for white. So i continue...} 13. Ba3 {obvious move, but forgetting one pawn...} Ng6 {cavalry foolows the infantery, here.} 14. g3 {pretty sure this is the final mistake. I felt so comfortable now to play the next few moves.} g4 {approaching, destroying.} 15. Nd2 f4 {once again, if gxh, here, it is all good bread for me.} 16. gxf4 {and it does!} Nxf4 {limits king moves, forbid Kc3 to move, threatening check.} 17. b5 {white seems unaware of the next move... and actually I had some options.} Qh4 {artillery accompanies cavalry.} 18. Nd1 {blunder. But now it is too late. I suppose white meant to protect f2 as the crucial point. Which it is, but I receive a free piece.} Nxe2+ {won't let escape.} 19. Kh1 g3 {and here is the final assault. infantry pushes.} 20. fxg3 {hxg is impossible due to check.} Nxg3+ {still impossible to take with the pawn h, so losing already a rook} 21. Kg2 {better... less worse was Kg1.} Bh3+ 22. Kg1 Nxf1 23. Nxf1 Rxf1# {I guess ataka wanted to give me the credit of the mate. thanks for this. All of this is of course full of mistakes by white, but shows one of the main idea of this opening: black counter-attack on the king-side has many chances and has to be fast.}
