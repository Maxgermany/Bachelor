1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {5. ........ a6 (according to the 1900s database this is the Kan Variation of the Sicilian.  The first few moves were just like my game with Marin, only my opponent deviated with 4. Nf6 instead of moving the black queen to b6.} 6. Bd3 {6. Bd3 (adds protection to the e4 pawn)} e6 7. f4 {7. f4 (I dominate the centre)} g6 8. Qe2 Bg7 9. Be3 O-O 10. O-O {10. O-O (from moves 7 to 10 we just continue to get our pieces out - the g7 bishop cuts right through to a1 and a lot of pieces can be lost to tactics there.} e5 11. fxe5 dxe5 {11. ........ dxe5 (after an exchange of pawns in the centre I retreat my knight to f3)} 12. Nf3 Bg4 13. Qd2 {13. Qd2 (after Bg4 pinning the knight my queen moves to d2).  Black brings out his other knight and I move my bishop to h6 attempting to weaken black's castled position by exchanging bishops.  There then follows an exchange of bishop for knight reaching the position after 15. ...... Nd4.} Nc6 14. Bh6 Bxf3 15. Rxf3 Nd4 16. Rh3 {16. Rh3 (gives added protection to the bishop on h6 and a kingside attack begins)} Qb6 {16.  ......... Qb6 completely throws me - OMG he is threatening a double check on f3 winning my queen and my b pawn is en pris - wait a minute, wait a minute, I can deal with both threats by playing 17. Na4, this attacks the black queen and defends the white b pawn so that if my opponent plays the threatened discovery it will merely result in an exchange of queens)} 17. Na4 Bxh6 18. Qxh6 {18. Q x h6 (black initiates an exchange of bishops).  His next move 18..... Qb4 is a nasty move to meet)} Qb4 19. b3 {19. b3 (defending the knight)} Nf5 {19. ......... Nf5 was nasty and unexpected because it attacks the white queen.  If I take the knight on c5 then 20 ....... Qd4  wins at least the exchange.  So I play 20. Qc1.} 20. Qc1 Nxe4 21. Bxe4 Qxe4 {21.  ...... Q x e4 (now I lose a pawn after the knight takes the e pawn which was doubly attacked).  My position is bad - he has a passed e pawn and a very dominant queen - mine is horribly passive (as usual).} 22. c4 {22. c4 (I move my c pawn to safety, away from the attentions of the black queen)} Nh4 23. Qf1 Rad8 24. Re1 Qd4+ 25. Kh1 Nf5 {25. ....... Nf5 (over the next few moves black consolidates his position and has two heavy pieces on the d file - I double up on the e pawn with Qe2.  Black defends with Qd2 and the queens are then exchanged.} 26. Qe2 Qd2 27. Qxd2 Rxd2 28. g4 {28. g4 (after the dust has settled I decide to harass the black knight with g4 and black responds by playing Ng7)} Ng7 29. Nc5 {29. Nc5 (I try to complicate things by putting two of his pawns under the hammer, the e pawn and the b pawn).  I notice something else.  If he tries to get his b pawn out of the way I can play 30. Ne4 winning the exchange because if he does not play Rfd8 then I will play 31. Nf6  with mate to follow on h7 next move.} b5 {29. ........... Wow! He plays it, he plays it!  29. ........ b5?  (losing the exchange for a pawn) but - he cannot resist my a2 poisoned pawn can he?} 30. Ne4 Rxa2 {30. ......... R x a2?? - no he can't and now he pays with his king.  My Christmas has come early! I play 31. Nf6  and my opponent resigned after I announced 32. Rxh7# next move (an Arabian Mate).  Beware of knights - they can catch you unawares and give you knightmares!!  In my opponent's case it was Arabian Knightmares!!  After the awful shock of my game with Bob I needed this shot in the arm like manna from heaven!!} 31. Nf6+ {}
