[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {The "losing" Scandinavian nobody plays anymore.} 2. e5 {exd is better for white. This is not bad, of course, but white has to be very active to attack black's position. Most people wouldn't do it. } Bf5 3. d4 e6 4. Nf3 {Threatens to exchange my lsb. I assume I will eventually lose this good bishop, but I can save it playing a3 to leave the a2 square for it. It is not necessarily a good plan, both are playable for black (IMO). In such positions, black has to think about defending carefully and try to untangle armoniously his pieces, but in my experience black can succeed on this task. } h6 {I choose to keep my bishop. My opponent was near me in ELO, so I didn't want to seem too "naive". } 5. Be2 {Another try, more aggressive, is c4, hitting the centre. If black goes (say) c6, c5 blocks black, who is squeezed. Or black can go for a Tartakower-like system, replaying c5 to c4 by white.  The played move indicates my opponent is not willing to attack very quickly. } c5 {Having moved the bishop to e2, I can play this with a strong probability my opponent won't play Bb5+ now. Not that this would be a terrible thing: black can perfectly hold against it, if he plays the correct moves for defence. } 6. c3 {Once again, my opponent acts carefully and passively. This is not by any means a bad move, of course. } Nc6 {Standard developement. } 7. O-O Qb6 {Another standard move. It blocks white's dsb sortie, due to Qxb2. If the knight is not on g1, though, this pawn is poisoned: Rg1 and Rxb7, being black still far from castling, can be deadly.  Another idea would have been Qa5, threatening BxN and Qxa8. Doubtful...} 8. h3 {Be3 is the standard answer here. The queen is not in danger, despite what it may seem. Black is ok exchanging pieces, since he plays for equality, not for attack. } Rc8 {...but, since white is going on with passive moves, let's put a little pressure on white's queenside. Now, the lsb IS valuable, and I can play this (instead of developing my dead kingside) because I can save it. White didn't play f4!, that is a "must" in this kind of positions for white to attack. } 9. dxc5 {White helps me a lot with this move. But true is that he couldn't avoid to open the c file, somehow, so he correctly prefer this move that leaves c3 protected. And plans to take his revenge with Bxc5, b4. } Bxc5 10. Nbd2 {...but white is, again, more passive than that. True is that the white N in b3 is very well placed. } a5 {...so I play quickly to avoid b4 and, in case of Ng3, white has to stop a4, rejecting it. } 11. Nb3 Nge7 {...but then I decided this plan was too passive. This was a mistake. I had to keep my bishop, even if it meant to leave the knight trapped on his home square. I didn't like it at all, so I realized my previous plan was pure crap. Ok. So, I'll act as if it all was part of a plan (sometime it works, and surely makes your opponent think a lot more :-))) (Don't try it with good players!)} 12. Nxc5 {Of course. It deprives me of a very important piece and leaves his dsb the owner of the dark squares. But I didn't imagine (on a blitz) that it meant that the queen would be trapped (in the middle of the board, a queen!!!) } Qxc5 13. Be3 {Here it is. Again, I had to act as if it would have been part of a plan :-D} d4 {The only move to save the queen. } 14. cxd4 Qd5 {Against any other queen move, white could have either trapped it or won a piece after d5, so this ugly place (it takes the good square from  the knight) is my move. Could I survive?} 15. a3 O-O {A bishop's storm is on sight. I cannot have my king exposed for what is to come...} 16. Qa4 {Here he goes attacking.} Na7 {I cannot play b4 due to Qxa5, but it's ok to fight for the column and reinforce b5. } 17. Rfc1 {Do you want to play exchanges? Of course, white is thinking in Bc2, a nice move that is another reason for playing Na7. } Nec6 {Now, with this knight here, I defend a4, and now I can move b5. } 18. Rc5 {Upppsss! This was a blitz game. I didn't see it... Now, it can help me, actually...} Qd7 {Now the threat is Nxe5, and white must exchange queens, then Rxa5, and black has a decent game. I can choose to go on with Nc6 or try a risky move like Rc2...} 19. Qd1 {Victory. White's attack is half being rejected. Now, let's prove our strenght. } b6 {Freeing the f6's knight from the duty.} 20. Rc3 Ne7 {Now, looking for his beloved d5. } 21. Rac1 {White should have tried d5, maybe. But this leaves me the nice spot...} Nd5 {Without almost thinking. } 22. Rc3xc8 Rxc8 23. Rxc8+ Qxc8 {White thinks that after the rooks are gone, his bishop's pair will prevail. } 24. Qc1 {But what bishop's pair? He plans to save it with QxQ+, BxQ? I don't want to exchange queen. With a pawn less, I have to keep pieces in order to create complications. The rooks allowed me to have my knight on d5, but now I don't get anything from the exchange but a knight in c8...} Qd7 25. Ne1 {White thinks that his dsb is more valuable than my knight. That can be true, but I know that in the endgame, a bishop's pair IS a lot. And this looks to be a two sides pawns' endgame, for sure. No way. } Nxe3 26. fxe3 {Now white has a very strong centre, but black can fight on the white squares, and the fry seems roughly even, or at least defendable. } b5 {Maybe a mistake, but I had to prevent white to grab more space.} 27. Kf2 {White is not in a piece hurry...} Kh7 {Nor I am. With this move, I set free my queen to leave the defence of c8. Anyway, white's queen penetration would be a problem, for sure, if left unattended.} 28. g4 {Thank you, sir, you leave my bishop in its best place. } Be4 29. Bd3 {BxB would have been even. We both lose our best pieces, and his knight is more active than mine. Qd5 is a trap, since it allows white queen's penetration on c7... so I had only one move. A risky one. } f5 30. exf6 e.p. Bxd3 31. Nxd3 Qf7 {Making white spend a tempo before retaking with the g pawn, having a supported defender for white central pawns. } 32. Nf4 Qxf6 33. Qc2+ Kg8 34. Qg6 {An odd decision, since Qc5 would have crushed me. To tell the truth, my game could have been destroyed in several occasions. This is not a good example about how to proceed in chess. But your opponent has to be smart enough to see all the implications. } Qxg6 {Let's see what happens in the endgame. My queen has little future, and the exchange provides me with tempoes and a single piece. A knight can be very poisonous, but I have to trust myself about being able to manage. } 35. Nxg6 Kf7 36. Ne5+ Kf6 37. h4 Nc8 {No fork in sight, so I can give my knight his most value. } 38. e4 Nd6 39. Nd7+ Ke7 40. Nc5 {Now the position is equal, except for the pawn less I have. "√Ånimo!", Let's go on...} Nc4 {Proving my assumptions, attacking. } 41. b4 {Wrong move. White must retire to Nd3. This gives me a good chance to win. } a4 42. d5 exd5 43. exd5 Nxa3 {Now black can apply a strong pressure. } 44. Ne4 Nc2 45. Nc3 a3 {The point. White cannot move because black promotes... } 46. d6+ {Another trick. If Kxd6, Nxb5+, followed by Nc3, and his kings comes on time to attack mine and defend everything. } Kd7 {So I don't take it. He can't, I can't...} 47. Ke2 {No promotion here, but I will still win a piece. } Nxb4 {White realizes he will lose a piece, there's no hope. Even if the king takes back black's knight, the black king will take white pawns before white can support them, so the game is lost...} 48. g5 a2 49. Nxa2 Nxa2 {The knight can escape... my opponent resigned.}
