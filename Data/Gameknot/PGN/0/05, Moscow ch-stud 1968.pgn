1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Bc4 {This variation is the Sicilian Dragon Yugoslav attack , one of the most popular variations of the Sicilian Dragon so as the Classic variation (6.Be2), Levenfish attack (6.f4) and 6.f3...} Nc6 9. Qd2 {The idea of 9.Qd2is to exchange the strong  blacks DSB on g7  , this is famous idea in the Sicilian dragon . another idea is to  castle the white king to the queen side and preparing  pawn attack on the kings side by g4,h4,h5 in the future ,will blacks game plan will be on the queen side.} Qa5 10. O-O-O {white cant exchang  the bishops on g7 right now , becouse of if 10.Bh6?-Bxh6.11.Qxh6-Nxd4 and white loses a knight , white must castele first for the safety of the king and the knight on d4 is protected by the rook on d1 . its not agood idea to exchange on c6 because it will help black to open hes B file for the black rooks , for example : 10.Nxc6-bxc6.11.0-0-0-Rb8 with minumum  equal game .} Bd7 11. h4 {karpov doesnt hurry to try  exchanging  the bishops , he opens the H and G filse first to expose blacks king side  by  playing h5. } Ne5 {good move , black wishes to open C file with tempo by attacking the white LSB on c4 this move gives black chances to keep hes DSB by playing 12...Rfc8 for example 11...Ne5 .12.Bb3-Rfc8.13.Bh6-Bh8....} 12. Bb3 Rfc8 13. h5 {intersting , Karpov offer black a free pawn with the idea to expose blacks king side , now if  black will  ignore that offer by playing 13...Nc4.14.Bxc4-Rxc4 .15.hxg-fxg.16.Bh6-Bxh6.17.Qxh6-Rxc3.18.bxc-Qxc3...., if 16...Bh8.17.Qg5 with good attack , } Nxh5 14. Bh6 Bxh6 15. Qxh6 Rxc3 {black forced to  do it because of white threat 16.g4-Nf6.17.Nd5!with massive mate attack .  } 16. bxc3 Qxc3 {its blounder , not because black loses matirial or  under mate in 1 move , the reason of that sirious mistake is because blacks queen on a5 was in best position for making dangerous threats on the white king ,now it seems that that move cost to black the game ,  it was better to move 16..Rac8,or Nf6.} 17. Ne2 {good move , Karpov prepering a long plan of maneuvering he's knight from the queen side to the king side and join to the attack on the black king , but first it runs away the black queen from the white king . } Qc5 {it is not good to play 17...Nd3+? because of 18.Rxd3-Qa1+.19.Kd2-Qxh1.20.g4 and white with big advantage....} 18. g4 Nf6 19. g5 Nh5 20. Rxh5 {good move . white must keep agressive game on the black king , if 20.Ng3?!-Bg4!.21.fxg4-Nxg4.22.Bxf7+-Kxf7.21.Qxh7+Ng7.22.Rhf1-Nf6.23.Qh3 and black have the advantange .} gxh5 21. Rh1 Qe3+ 22. Kb1 {good move , white must play carefully , the move 22.Kb2?could give black minimum draw for example :22...Nd3+.23.cxd-(23.Kb1-Qxf3! and black won )23...Qxe2.24.Ka1-Qd3+ and black can drew this game by internal check .} Qxf3 {the destiny of the white knight on e2 doesn't care  black ,black is  fighting for he's life now . if 22...Qxe2?.23.Qxh5-e6.24.Qxh7+Kf8.25.Qh8+Ke7.26.Qf6+Ke8.27.Rh8#} 23. Rxh5 e6 {black can not defent h7  any more , if 23....Qxe4.24.g6!-Qxg6.25.Rg5....,intresting for black 23..Kg6.24.Qxh7+Kf8.25.Rh6-e6.26.Rxg6-fxg6.27.Qxd7-Qxe2.28.Qxd6+Kg7.29.Qe7+Kh8.30.Qf6+Kh7.31.Qf7+Kh8.32.Qxg6......} 24. g6 {this move breaks blacks  defense , if 24.Qxh7+? Kf8 and black's king saved , now it imposible 25.Qh8+-Ke7.26.Qxa8-Qxh5 and if .25.Nd4-Qd1+.26.Kb2-Qxd4...., now after 24.g6! black forced to capture it with 24...Ng6 because of :24...hxg.25.Qh8#or 24...fxg.25.Qxh7+Kf8.26.Qh8+Ke7.27.Rh7+Kf7.28.Qxa8......} Nxg6 25. Qxh7+ Kf8 26. Rf5 {very good move 26.Rf5!!take off F file from the black Queen and avoid any kind of check , ofcourse because of the mate threat there is only one way for black to keep he's king a live . for a while ......} Qxb3+ 27. axb3 exf5 28. Nf4 {another effective move , capturing the un protected knight on f4 will lead to losing Rook for example 28...Nxf4.29.Qh8+Ke7.30.Qxa8......} Rd8 29. Qh6+ Ke8 30. Nxg6 fxg6 31. Qxg6+ Ke7 32. Qg5+ {not 32.exf -Rf8 and black can some how stay a live , but after 32.Qg5+! Black is un protected now . } Ke8 33. exf5 Rc8 34. Qg8+ Ke7 35. Qg7+ {and black resigns , because of White's un stoppable F pawn marsh  to the crown . thank you ...}
