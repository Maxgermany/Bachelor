1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {French Defense Winawer Variation. i play first time.} 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ {i don't know why capturing the pawn first ... cxd4 is not better or is it better?!} 6. bxc3 {White has double c pawn but they are not weakness instead i think they are strong indeed, they make your center strong and White got b-file for his rook.} Ne7 7. Qg4 {This is the book move Nf3 is another way.} Qc7 {upto now everything went according to Book. From this position according to Book it is Qxg7 Rg8 Qxh7 cxd4 and White cannot capture in return cxd4. See yourself Why. 10. Ne2 Nbc6 11. f4 Bd7 12. Qd3 And White don't like this position 'cause White will nott get what he wanted When he played Qg4. Instead White has two isolated pawns actually 3 and 1 double pawn exposed king. While Black King is rock solid after castling Queen Side and is rook at g-file is too dangerous for White as White King will go to g-file after castling ... So simply analysing above theory abro denied book and played next move ...} 8. Bd2 cxd4 {What i do now, take the g pawn or c pawn.} 9. cxd4 {so White don't want 'break the center'.} Qxc2 10. Qxg7 Rg8 11. Qh6 {better than Qf6.} Qe4+ 12. Qe3 Nbc6 {?!} 13. Qxe4 dxe4 {d4 pawn is en-prise} 14. Ne2 Nf5 15. Bc3 e3 16. fxe3 Nxe3 17. Kf2 {as Black threatened Nc2 } Nd5 {Jeremy Silman says ... Most Games are won by good conduct of Minor Piece } 18. Rd1 {Because Knight has to leave his job of defending the d4 pawn} Nxc3 19. Nxc3 {do u see this knight loves to go at f6 and after this exchange he got one step closer automatic ...} Bd7 20. Ne4 {No one can stop this knight to go at f6.} Ke7 {instead of castling Black thought, King should be involved in Fighting ...} 21. Nf6 Rg7 22. Bd3 {!! brilliant move it gives Black the d4 pawn but this is trap.} h6 {but Black moved the h6 pawn that was underattack. Did Black see the trap and not play Nxd4? Well. What should White should play now,  Any move can change the path of game ...} 23. h4 {!! this move is really fantastic. main job of this move is gaurding the g5 square and now if u see g7 rook is trapped and it is as if Black plays with rook down.} Nxd4 {?? What! Did Black didn't see the trap before?} 24. Be4 Bc6 25. Rxd4 Bxe4 26. Rxe4 {Do you see how brilliantly Knight works calmly standing at f6! } Rc8 {Threat is Rc2  and winning the g2 pawn but more importantly coming back into game as Black will get two actvice rooks  ... so What White should do, should he stop the rook by Rhe1 and Re2 .. or something else ...} 27. Rd4 {! wow White does not care his g2 pawn do u see Why. .. see it urself before seeing following calculation ...  if Black go for g2 pawn in next move suppose as Rc2  Kf3  black can capture g2 pawn with both his rooks, and capturing with any rook give Black checkmate himself in 2 moves. see it urself.} h5 {but Black is clever enough.  but what is the reasone of h5? } 28. Rhd1 {White double the rooks because he simply wants to exchange one rook with Blacks only active rook leaving black with one passive rook and peice down while queen side pawns of black are so vulnerable ...} Rg6 29. Rd4d7+ Kf8 30. Rd7d8+ Rxd8 31. Rxd8+ Kg7 {if Ke7 then Re8#} 32. Rd7 {White did not go for h5 pawn but for queen side pawns as a3 pawn is headache for black.} Rxf6+ {? last mistake   may be ... Rh6 .... Rh8 was better, making White's job little difficult.} 33. exf6+ Kxf6 34. Rxb7 a5 35. Ra7 e5 36. Rxa5 Kf5 37. Kf3 {! stoping king} f6 38. Rb5 {i want to know your comments about this game, please send me. :)}
