1. e4 {This is the first time I defeated a player rated about 200 points above me. A very short game which shows how one mistake can lead to quick defeat.} e5 2. Nf3 Bc5 {The first mini-mistake if at all -- leaving the pawn at e5 unprotected. This might qualify more as an overlook unless my opponent had something more sinister planned ! } 3. Nxe5 {I take the free pawn.} Qe7 {Surely this move is more reactionary than something that is well planned  ?  Or is it not ?   } 4. d4 {Simple counter to protect my Knight as well as threaten the black bishop.} Bb6 {The bishop has no option but to retreat} 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bg5 Nc6 {Some more standard development. Both sides are developing their pieces. Both have developed the pieces although white might be slightly better co-ordinated.} 7. Nd5 {Threatening the queen -- white tries to develop an attack !} Qe6 8. Bc4 {White has many attacking pieces now - though the position might be balanced.} O-O {And here is the big mistake --- Castling at the wrong time !  Black might be feeling pressure from the multiple white pieces and thought it would be a 'safe' option to castle. This however turned out to be the biggest mistake in this game.} 9. Nxf6+ {Checking the Black King and gaining a guaranteed advantage by taking the black queen.} gxf6 10. Bxe6 {Here we get her.} dxe6 {And now the next big mistake -- I was hoping black would take either the bishop at e6 or the knight at e5. I knew I need the bishop dangerously positioned on the open g file for a quick checkmate. Taking the bishop g5 would have been a much better move.} 11. Bxf6 {My bishop survives and takes a very dangerous position. This is where I realize that the game is won.} Ne7 {Black tries to draw my bishop away from this dangerous square f6.} 12. Qh5 {I do not take the bait and work toward my checkmate chance.} Ng6 13. Qh6 {One step closer.} Nf4 14. Qg7# {And there. A good short game which shows how something as simple as castling at the wrong time can prove to be deadly.}
