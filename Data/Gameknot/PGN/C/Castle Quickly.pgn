1. e4 {Yet another blitz game.} c5 2. Qf3 {?  I still don't know why my opponent played this, as he didn't even try for Scholar's Mate.} Nc6 3. c3 Nf6 4. d3 {d4 doesn't work because the white queen is misplaced.} d5 5. Nd2 e5 {Black's pawn center is usually white's pawn center, but white threw away valuable time here.} 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. Nc4 b5 {Gaining time and space.} 8. Na3 a6 {Also good was Rb8.  This doesn't really lose time because white must spend a move to get the knight back into the game.} 9. Be2 Be7 10. Nh3 {Because of the queen, the knight must be awkwardly placed.} O-O 11. Qg3 {Instead of castling or bringing the a3 knight back into play, white makes another bad queen move.  Bh6 is easily met with Bf6.} b4 {! White's uncastled king is coming to haunt him.  cxb4 is impossible due to Bh4! followed by ...Nd4 and ...Nxb4, threatening Nc2+, Nxe2 and Qxd3, and hoping to trap the white queen.} 12. Nc2 {? Better was Nb1, saving a pawn.} bxc3 13. bxc3 Nxc3 14. Bf3 {?? The losing move.  White expects me to defend the knight, but black has...} Qxd3 {Now white can't castle!} 15. Ne3 {Bh6 was stiffer.  Now black piles it on.} Nd4 {Threatening e2 3 times and also preparing for Nc2+ plays.} 16. Ng1 {White is undeveloping.} Rd8 {And now, with Qd2/d1 plays afoot, white is completely lost.} 17. Bxa8 {? Loses immediately, but white was lost anyway.} Nc2+ 18. Nxc2 Qd1# {And a decoy combination leading to checkmate to finish.  I hope you all enjoyed this game.}
