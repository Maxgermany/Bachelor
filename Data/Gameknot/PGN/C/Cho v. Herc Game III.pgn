1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {I played two knights again, which confused the heck out of me.} 4. Ng5 Qe7 {Terrible move. Should have went...d5, yeah? Somehow I will manage to salvage this.} 5. Nxf7 Qc5 {I figure I take a lil extra and trap his knight in there, I may break even or better.} 6. d3 b5 {More bishop chasing.} 7. Bd5 {nuntar (1566) on 27-Feb-09: White seems to have gone wrong somewhere. 7. Bb3 was better: 7... a5 8. Nxh8 a4 9. Bd5 Nxd5 10. exd5 Nd4 11. c3 and White is okay. ... This move allows me to trade bishop for knight. In so doing, I was originally thinking that once he traded back for the knight that took the bishop I'd be able to snatch the knight it was protecting with my king, but...} Nxd5 8. exd5 {...as you can see, that would result in me losing another knight. Instead, being forced to move my knight I see the opportunity to set up a fork of my own.} Nd4 {You take my rook,  I'll take yours. Of course if you don't take my rook, I'll be taking your knight. (Assuming he guards with Na3 I mean.)} 9. Nxh8 {I don't think he saw the fork coming, which is kind of ironic, since he always opens Italian (and diving in for the fork.)} Nxc2+ {A lil taste of yer own medicine!} 10. Kd2 Nxa1 11. b3 Qxf2+ 12. Qe2 Qxe2+ {Sacrifice a queen to save a knight.} 13. Kxe2 Nc2 14. Rf1 Nd4+ {And now he loses his will to live...or perhaps can't get to a computer on time, who knows? GG}
