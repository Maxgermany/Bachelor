[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 Nf6 {Usually I play the Dutch against the English (I sometimes play e5, c6 etc. and play the white side of the c3 Sicilian), but, because I've been in a hypermodern phase, I thought I'd try for a King's Indian} 2. d4 {My opponent obliges, and steers me toward the main line.} g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 {Many book lines play e4 here - I favor e3 because it's less of a commitment - no sé cual mueve es mejor aqui pero personalmente yo prefiero e3 por que e3 me ayuda defender mí campo ahora y luego podimos romper con f4.} d6 5. h3 O-O 6. Nf3 {This is where I depart from main line theory by playing c5. Up to this point, database is showing thousands of games that went exactly this way. For future reference, theory prefers e5 here.} c5 7. d5 Na6 8. a3 Bd7 9. Be2 Nc7 10. a4 a6 11. b3 Nfe8 {Playing for f5 here - pushing the f pawn feels like winning!} 12. Bb2 f5 13. Qc2 e5 14. Bd3 f4 {!  This move creates an outpost on g3 which proves to be a formidable infiltration square. The main criticism of Nf6 and Nf3 openings (both of which I play regularly) is that they sometimes have serious issues creating space - as we will see later, this particular game is won and lost entirely based on the space I was able to create here. } 15. Na2 {?  No sé por que esta mueva estuvo jugado - obviamente estoy controlando b4 ahora y no pienso que c1 es mejor que d1 por este caballo....de todos modos no tan mejor que tu necesitas usar un tiempo} h5 16. Be2 g5 17. Nd2 g4 18. hxg4 Bxg4 {?  This was a mistake which cost me a pawn - it worked out for me, but I think this might have been my undoing against a better player (and that is, of course, no insult to Ahmed who plays at least as well as I do)} 19. f3 Bd7 20. Rxh5 Nf6 21. Rh1 Qe8 22. O-O-O Nh5 23. Bf1 Ng3 {!  And here we are - the invasion square! Pick an outpost and use it well, Ali babe!} 24. Rh2 Kf7 {I have my eye on the g and h files - this move prepares my major pieces to claim them!} 25. Re1 Rh8 26. Rxh8 Qxh8 27. Nc3 {The knight returns to the square it left many moves ago...que triste} Ne8 28. Ne2 Nxe2+ 29. Bxe2 Nf6 30. Qd1 Nh5 31. Nf1 Qh7 32. Qd2 Bh6 33. Bd3 Rg8 {For better or worse, I tend to work very slowly when trying to expand a slight advantage, and everything has been leading to this position.  The h and g files are mine (though h needs unblocking...) - my knight is pointed at the outpost - my bishop is pointed at the king and queen - and my king is underneath a massive pawn blob with few immediate lanes of attack.   The d7 bishop, sadly, has no part in this game (and never does)} 34. Re2 Ng3 35. Rf2 Qg6 36. Kd1 Nxf1 {?  There's a very good chance that this is a mistake. By move 36, I was eager to get my advantage and win with it - hasty and greedy...particularly for my style. Bg5 or Qh5 were pefectly adequate here. } 37. Bxf1 Qh5 38. Ke1 {My opponent clearly thinks he has a defensible position here and starts moving the king back and forth....this definitely helped me get into place for an unstoppable attack. } Bg5 39. Kd1 Bh4 40. Re2 Bg3 41. Qa5 {?  It's too late to do something active now - I think it's time to defend the king!} Qh1 42. Qc7 {???  This is just poor calculation. The game could have gone on for another 20 moves...white is still a pawn up, so if the material is traded down to nothing, I am theoretically on the losing side.   Still, I am well placed, if I may say so - the bishop is using the outpost I created 28 moves ago- the rook owns the g file - the queen owns the h file - and even the poor little d7 bishop (who, only moved once in a 46 move game) is doing his part to block the mean lady from squeezing out some kind of draw. } Qxf1+ 43. Kd2 Ke7 44. Qxb7 {?  Grabbing pawns is not priority A right now!} Be1+ {The bishop cannot be taken - I've calculated it to forced mate in every line there.} 45. Kd3 Rxg2 46. Qxa6 Qxe2# {A very pretty infiltration that worked a treat, if I may say so.}
