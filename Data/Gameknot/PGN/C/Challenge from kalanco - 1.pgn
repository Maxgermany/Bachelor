[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Lundin (Kevitz-Mikenas) defence"]

1. d4 {My preferred opening.} Nc6 {His preferred opening.} 2. Qd3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nb4 4. Qf3 Nxc2+ {Did not see the absolute fork coming. I'll be watching for that next time.} 5. Kd1 Nxa1 {This turns out to be a rather poor move actually. His knight NEVER gets to move from that position. He effectively gave up a developed knight for a rook that might never get developed.} 6. e4 b6 7. Bc4 e6 8. Bf4 Qe7 9. e5 Qb4 10. Qxa8 Kd8 11. Ba6 Qxd4+ 12. Bd2 Qxf2 13. Qxc8+ Ke7 14. exf6+ Kxf6 {Should've used the pawn.} 15. Ne4+ {Ouch.} Ke7 16. Nxf2 h5 17. Ne4 f5 18. Bb4+ c5 19. Nxc5 Rh6 20. Nxd7+ {He surrendered at this point. I was a bit worried at parts in the game, but I managed to turn it around. Had he continued, I think it would've gone Ke7-f7, Bb4-d2, Rh6-g6, Qc8-f8 for checkmate. Moving the rook in that chain would be non-ideal but it would be logical considering how my opponent plays. }
