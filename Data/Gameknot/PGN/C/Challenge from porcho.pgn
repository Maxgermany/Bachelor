1. d4 d5 2. c4 {The queen's gambit :) My favorite.} e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 Bb4 5. Bd2 {Nothing special.} Bxc3 6. Bxc3 Nc6 7. e3 b6 8. Bd3 Ba6 {I would have probably moved to b7.} 9. b3 O-O 10. O-O Rb8 {A 'mysterious' rook move.} 11. Rb1 Na5 12. Bxa5 {Yes, yes, it was a bishop for a knight, but it does give him isolated, doubled pawns and it wasn't a great bishop anyway.} bxa5 13. Qc2 c6 14. Ne5 {Nice spot for my knight.} Rc8 15. a4 g6 {? I wouldn't have done this, it's too weakening.} 16. f4 Nh5 17. Rf3 f6 {?? Now this, is a blunder.} 18. Bxg6 {I thought about the knight, but decided on taking with the bishop. If he takes my bishop, then Qxg6+ Kh8 and black is obviously doomed. If he takes my knight then I can take his pawn or knight.} Ng7 19. Bxh7+ Kh8 {Only move for him.} 20. Ng6+ {I carefully calculated this sac.} Kxh7 21. Nxf8+ Kg8 22. Rh3 {Probably should have rescued my knight.} Qxf8 23. Qg6 {His king is immobilized, but it looks like he has it under control.} dxc4 {?? Allows my rook an open file, now completely losing but pretty bad.} 24. bxc4 Bxc4 {???? Got greedy, he should have left his bishop where it was then I couldn't move my rook to b7.} 25. Rb7 {I pounce on the opportunity. Black has no way to stop mate that I can see.} Qe8 26. Qxg7# {Good game black! Please comment and rate.}
