1. d4 {youll see this opening in my other annotated game It is NOT pretty, I lose some minors due to carelessness} b6 {fiancetto? ok} 2. e3 Bb7 3. c4 e6 4. Nf3 g6 {DOUBLE FIANCETTO!!?!} 5. Nbd2 Bg7 6. Qe2 h5 {!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?} 7. Ne4 {I admit this was a mistake, I drop a free minor. never do this move. } Bxe4 8. Ne5 Nc6 9. d5 {heres the other free minor} Nxe5 10. dxe6 fxe6 {always take with the outer pawn} 11. c5 {I sac'd the poor pawn to unclog the diagnol of nowhere} bxc5 12. Qb5 Rb8 {!?!?!?!? free pawn, anyways} 13. Qxc5 Bf8 {!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????????? this person't turn to be careless, i guess. two free pawns in a row.} 14. Qxa7 Nd3+ 15. Bxd3 Bxd3 16. Qd4 {this is a lovely fork, where i redeem myself. note that I'm exactly a rook's worth of points down at this point} Bb4+ {prolonging the inevitable } 17. Bd2 {should he take?} Bf5 {he made 2 mistakes: one is the b bishop and the other is...} 18. Qxh8 {... this.} Ke7 19. Bxb4+ {i honestly did not see the rook, if this plan wasn't thought out as well as it was, this would have worried me} Rxb4 20. Qh7+ Ke8 {mistake #.... i lost count} 21. Qxg8+ Ke7 {i wanted to trade queens, kind of. the bishop scared me a little in a battle of otherwise rooks. } 22. Qg7+ Ke8 {?} 23. Qc3 Qb8 24. Qh8+ Ke7 {this is where i was most tempted to trade. oh well, should've when you could've (skillet)} 25. Qh7+ Kd6 {vicious cycle broken} 26. Qg7 {should've moved there in the first place. make a mental note if you find yourself in this EXACT spot} Rxb2 {saw this coming, didn't think it was a threat. moving on. (now that i see the bishop, i see the potential danger)} 27. Rd1+ Kc6 28. Qxd7+ Kc5 {can you find the way to take the rook for free? } 29. Qd4+ Kc6 30. Qd7+ {this was unnecessary please ignore this for the rook puzzle.} Kc5 31. Qd4+ Kc6 32. Rc1+ {you can almost hear the burn.} Kb7 33. Qxb2+ Kc8 {if I was going to trade, I would have done it now. but i didn't, instead i got a free queen in 3 moves: watch (can you see it?)} 34. Qh8+ Kd7 {he moved there to prevent the deadly king-queen rook pin, it was a good move.} 35. Rd1+ {another non required move, but just to drive my point home} Ke7 36. Qxb8 {Resignation. White wins this game, an unavoidable attack on c7 would force the king into hiding behind is precious e pawn. I would castle and hit him with the triangle attack of queen rook rook}
