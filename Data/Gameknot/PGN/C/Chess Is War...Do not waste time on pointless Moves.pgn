1. e4 {Chess is a War bt two armies. That being said the main objective is to mate. Not snatch pawns like my opponent did, or just trading pieces. Chess is about tactics, and strategy. Just because a trade is in front of you does not mean you have to take it, think first.....Always look for mate.  My strategy and always is to constrict my opponents by its own pieces.} e5 {Same Song huh..............well I was bored playing the same old routine. I wanted to try something different.  One of my approach in chess is to admit DEFEAT from the get-go. I like to play losing positions. "There is more to learn from a losing position than one you are winning" by father always say.} 2. f4 {Bold Move..........For those who studied Chess this is a Bad Move....a NO-NO.} Nc6 3. Nf3 d6 {At this point I felt the pressure coming. Blacks White Bishop AND Blacks Queen are ready to be deployed on my king side........} 4. Nc3 Nf6 {Hum !!!  I spoke to soon..........no pressure here.} 5. Bb5 {This is my plan...........Because of Pawns C7, D6, E5 aligned and Blocking the Black Bishop I will try to smother black. By doing so, Black will have no choice and hopefully make a mistake......} Bd7 6. O-O exf4 {Read my title. This is my opponents 1st wasted move.   My opponent has no yet fully develop and He is already on the attack.} 7. d4 {This is my Plan. I am going to trade my bishop with Black's Knight. If He takes it with the Bishop, then I will move my D pawn to D5, forcing him to retreat. If he takes it with the pawn B7, my job is done, I shall return to a king side attack} a6 {Black hasnt seen my plan yet thus making in my opinion his 2nd mistake.} 8. Bxc6 bxc6 {Pay Close Attention, I waited two moves before I take the F4 pawn. This pawn is mine. So no need to rush.  <<< Its like a woman that you are interested in. Why rush when she already told you she is yours. >>>} 9. Bxf4 {Lets Recap.....Black is Pretty Much in Trouble now. His King hasnt castle yet, He has two worthless bishops, and a Knight just there for show. Mind you if he puts his White Bishop on G4, THAT would be of no importance. He could attack that knight all he wants. I actually would love to open that F-file which I will in due time} Rb8 {3rd wasted move.........This is war my friends dont waste time on pointless move to snatch pawns. As soon as I capture your king the game is done.  Dont waste precious time and moves on snatching pawns.} 10. Qe2 Be7 11. e5 {Blacks Queen side is damaged really bad. I want to do the same to his king side. I want to take out the G7 pawn from its position cause I feel he is about to castle. With that pawn out of the way,  the H6 square is weak, and the King is pretty much vulnerable to attacks} dxe5 12. Nxe5 O-O 13. Rae1 {Lets analyze something here. I could protect the B2 pawn. But the question is WHY?..............Why delay my "checkmate" plans for a pawn. Besides since Black is interested in B2  I should use it to buy me some time to make the necessary move to mate.} Bd6 {That's the error I was looking for. I waS expecting Bishop to B4. bUT THEN AGAIN BY trading it would only fortefy my positions.   But you will see why BD6 is the error I was looking for} 14. Bg5 {Remmeber when I said I wanted to budge the G7 pawn out of its G file course, now is my chance} Rxb2 {Mistake # 4....Here I am attacking you r king side but you are interested in pawn snatching..............} 15. Bxf6 gxf6 16. Nc4 Rb4 {This is the plan :  I want to place a knight on the F6 square. I want to corner Blacks King on the H file, With my rook on the E file on the G file.} 17. Ne4 {I could take the Bishop now....the black one. But i dont want to do that yet..... I want to set my Troops in position. And furthermore, I want to camouflage my attack. Although PLACING THE KNIGHT ON F6 IS INEVITABLE"  unless he moves it now.} Be6 {Wasted move number 5.................. Some of you think after I take the Bishop on D6 and the trades are effective, Black could pinned my Queen whose is diagonal to my rook. If that should happen, I could always check him on G4.  "For every square you leave behind, you leave an unprotected square"} 18. Ncxd6 f5 {Now I knew it was over.........} 19. Nxf5 Bxf5 20. Rxf5 Qxd4+ {I could trade Queens right now, but why...I see CHECKMATE DO YOU SEE IT.  } 21. Kh1 Rfb8 {Mate in 5} 22. Nf6+ {tHIS IS IT................CHECKMATE IS INEVITABLE.  Try playing this game with white, no matter what black's king does it s mate} Kh8 23. Qe8+ {I love that sacrifice} Rxe8 24. Rxe8+ Kg7 25. Rg8+ Kh6 26. Rh5# {Black has wasted 5 moves in this game. 5 moves that means a lot in War.  So if you are playing me iin the futur be certain to make moves that would ensure slowly but surely your victory}
