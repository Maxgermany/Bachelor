1. d4 {I Hate the Queen Pawn} d5 {But lets Mirror} 2. c4 {I know he wants it but................} dxc4 {.... lets take it} 3. e4 b5 {He has taken control of the centre but i will back up my pawn} 4. a3 g6 {I need to attack the centre pawns.  I will try and get the bishop out.  He might attack my knight if i moved Nf6 giving me the run around.  And i dont want to lose any pawns yet as it would open me up. } 5. Nc3 {That move strengthens his centre control and explains his previous a3 move.  The problem I have now is protecting my pawn on b5.  It is easy protected but a4 for him may cause me a headache. } Bd7 {I chose to protect with my Bishop even though it disrupts my planned attack on his d4 pawn (with my plan of Bg7).  I wasn't too keen on a6 nor d6 as i felt it would made me weak.} 6. Qf3 {Initially i was thinking this was to attack f7 but more realistically i guess he is aiming to move e4 to threaten  the capture of my rook on a8.} c6 {I wasn't keen on this as i mentioned earlier but this i believed to be the best option although i did consider Na6 and leaving the defence until it was attacked directly.} 7. a4 {I knew this was coming.} Qa5 {but how about this.  Pins his Knight and prevents the capture of b5(without losing Rook).  Although I predict his next move will be Bd2.} 8. Be2 {I can only suggest this is to clear the path for castling.} Bg7 {I finally get round to attacking the pawn on d4.} 9. e5 {Got to be a good move as gives me so many restrictions.} e6 {This halts the advancing of his pawn, gives me an option to get my knight off g8 and possibly castling but on the downside restricts my bishop.  } 10. Nh3 {I was right he is intending to castle.} Ne7 {I will move my knight to e7.  Now I guess castle castle.} 11. O-O {castle} O-O {castle} 12. Bd2 {he is still after my rook and now my queen.  He is giving himself two options moving his knight to take my pawn and attack my queen and take the pawn with a4 pawn as now his rook is  protected.  The knight will have to be at a later date as then his bishop would be lost.  I should have addressed this before castling.} Qb4 {I have done this to stop him moving his knight for now and to attack b2.  I guess he may still take pawn a4xb5} 13. Nd5 {ok } Qxd2 {Bishop for.....} 14. Nc7 {Darn it I missed that I assumed he would take my knight and check me. } Qxd4 {I might be able to get a few pawns out of this though.  } 15. Qc3 {I can see what he is doing trying to protect.  queen for queen soon I think.} Bxe5 {I will take this pawn anyway.  I suppose it will be queen for queen now but if he does take my rook now I can pull back my queen to d6 and threaten his queen and try for the pawn on h2 opening his king up slightly.} 16. Nxa8 {well he took the rook} Qd6 {so I Qd6 it is.} 17. Rad1 {ok he wants queen for queen I will take it.} Bxh2+ {but I will take his pawn first.} 18. Kh1 {I was going to take my bishop back to e4 but then it will be queen for bishop and queen. Perhaps I should have done queen for queen instead.} Nd5 {I better protect my queen it makes him move his, hopefully from the diagonal running to my king.  I had also better be careful I have a lot of dangers here.} 19. Qa5 {what are my options.  I might have to forfeit a7 pawn and allow his knight to escape.  I can not move any knight. I could put queen on e5 ready for bishop for bishop allowing knight to move.  I could advance a7 - a6 but na8 -nb6 would enforce knight for knight.} a6 {I chose this thinking he will move Knight then take knight for knight which I would do with e6 pawn, threatening h3 knight to open his king up more} 20. g3 {never spotted that. I will free my knight and attack his bishop.} Qe5 {I guess I will still lose my bishop.} 21. Rfe1 {knew i wouldnt get bishop for bishop} Bxg3 {but this seems better anyway I will have two pawns and open his king right up.} 22. Bg4 {cant see the logic} Qf4 {oops...  i just realised as i pressed submit lets hope he misses taking my queen.} 23. fxg3 {ha ha   -   he missed it} Qxg4 {bishop for  bishop - do me} 24. Kh2 {protects both} e5 {if  he takes my pawn I take his knight} 25. Qd2 {is he falling to pieces or got a cunning plan} Qxh3+ {not one to pass up on a free knight} 26. Kg1 {free pawn I see} Qxg3+ {Kf1 will give me his queen or mate} 27. Qg2 {best move so queen for queen} Qxg2+ {he might have an extra rook but his knight is trapped and look at my pawns compared to his.} 28. Kxg2 {yes} f6 {now re enforce e5 and plot for a queen} 29. a5 {now he at least will have knight for knight} Re8 {long shot but I am looking for a fork with his king and rook on d1} 30. Re4 {hmmm} f5 {I wonder if he will fall for it go rh4} 31. Rh4 {yes he has} Ne3+ {check} 32. Kf2 Nxd1+ {check} 33. Ke2 Nxb2 {I will have that thankyou now push for a queen} 34. Nb6 {what you going to do with that } Be6 {I might as well keep my bishop - and the resignation Gameover}
