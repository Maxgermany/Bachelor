1. e4 d5 2. e5 f6 3. d4 c6 4. Nf3 Bg4 5. h3 Bh5 6. g4 Bg6 7. Nc3 Nd7 8. Bd3 Qc7 9. Bxg6+ hxg6 10. Bf4 {the pawn on e5 needs help. the bishop and the pawn on e5 reveal new threats.} g5 11. Bg3 fxe5 {two  black pawns are now an easy prey. Nf3 will threat f7, pawn d4 will limit black's development. } 12. dxe5 Nc5 {retreat due to the new threat. most of the black figures are out of play, the king is "stuck". Let's attack, if not mate,  may be will receive some advantage. h3 is weak. } 13. Nxg5 {black 0-0-0 is impossible now, due to Ng5-f7 use of e5 and bishop on g3 gives interesting possibilities.  My h3 is weak.  } Qb6 14. Qf3 O-O-O 15. Qf5+ {wrong, leaving Nc3 without defense, not exploits Ng5-f7} e6 16. Nxe6 Ne7 17. Qf7 {the only way to save Ne6.} Qxb2 {right} 18. O-O {white queen on f7 defends white pawn on h3: if 100. ... Rh8:h3 101. Q:f8 } Qxc3 19. Nxd8 Kxd8 20. Rae1 {trap: if Q:c2 and then Q:a1, white Ra1} Qxc2 {it works! all the white threats are still available, but black threat (Ne4) on g3 and then h3 is postponed.} 21. e6 {trap, if 21. ... Q:a2 22. Ra1 and real chance to win } Qh7 {black saw the trap and try to win through undefended h3. White is looking for an attack with a check in 2 moves at most.} 22. Qf4 {like black, white has their own line of attack, without obstacle. Black has obstacle on h3.} Qxh3 {black lacks one move. White can't avoid Qxh3, so it's better to remove threats from the black King.  22.  N:e6 is much better. White needs to look after the way to cop with Q:h3} 23. Qb8+ {white has a way to an unavoidable mate.} Nc8 24. Qc7+ {}
