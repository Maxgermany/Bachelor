[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {B00 King's Pawn Opening. The most popular opening.} e5 {C20 King's Pawn Game} 2. Nf3 {C40 King's Knight Opening. This is the most logical second move against Black's symmetrical answer to the King's Pawn.} f6 {C40 Damiano Defense.} 3. Nxe5 {C40 Damiano Defense.} fxe5 {C40 Damiano Defense.} 4. Qh5+ {C40 Damiano Defense. Now black is in trouble. g6 is a blunder and will lose a rook.} Ke7 {C40 Damiano Defense. This opening is a hell for black. A small mistake will lose the game.} 5. Qxe5+ {C40 Damiano Defense. Black is forced to move his King to f7.} Kf7 {C40 Damiano Defense.} 6. Bc4+ {C40 Damiano Defense. Now black is in deep trouble. 2 possible moves exist, d5 and Kg6.} Kg6 {C40 Damiano Defense. Ouch... I don't know what kind of opening this is!!! Black moves into forced mate.} 7. Qf5+ {C40 Damiano Defense. Black is forced to move the King to h6.} Kh6 {C40 Damiano Defense.} 8. d3+ {still the bloody C40 Damiano Defense.} g5 {C40 Damiano Defense.} 9. h4 {Great!!! This is the key to victory for white. Forced mate now looks more obvious.} Bb4+ {Now it does not really matter what black is willing to do!} 10. Ke2 Qe7 {There is no better move for black. Any other move will end the game by Qxg5#} 11. Bxg5+ {Forks black's king and queen.} Kg7 12. Bxe7 Nxe7 13. Qf7+ {Mate in 4.} Kh6 {Forced. Moves it out of check.} 14.
