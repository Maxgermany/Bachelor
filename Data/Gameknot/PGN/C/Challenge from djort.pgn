[Opening "Bird's opening (A02)"]

1. f4 {Bird opening, nothing says it's not a good opening (well, ok a bit less than 1.e4 but a good opening). Danielsen plays 1.f4} c5 {A good answer. For example, it's difficult for White to build a stonewall.  With 1...c5, it's more a close opening. If Black prefers attack 1....e5 is powerful (gambit From) and Black takes the hand.} 2. Nf3 {A standard move (and protect Qh4 )} Nc6 3. g3 {To stay in Bird opening (avoid Sicilian or Pirc for example). Polar bear system.} Nf6 4. Bg2 {Standard move in polar bear system.} d6 5. O-O e5 {A good idea.} 6. fxe5 {And not the good answer (d3 is good with the idea to take with the bishop).} dxe5 7. d3 e4 {Probably better to develop pieces.} 8. dxe4 Nb4 9. Qxd8+ {No castle for Black} Kxd8 10. Na3 {To protect the rook.} Nxe4 11. Ne5 {Ask a question to f7 (with a fork chess/rook) and to Ke4} Be6 {The good answer is Nd6.} 12. Bxe4 f5 {Often hazardous to open the pawn f} 13. Bg5+ Be7 14. Bxe7+ Kxe7 15. Bxb7 {Better was Fxf} Rad8 {In this place a fork king / rook is possible } 16. c3 {Try to have the place for Kc6  and a fork} Nd5 17. Nc6+ Kd7 18. Nxd8 Kxd8 {The black king can be chess by the  white rook (and lost a piece in the d column), better to take with the rook} 19. Bxd5 Bxd5 20. Rad1 {Show move 14. ...Kxe7 ?} Ke7 21. Rxd5 g6 22. Rfd1 Rb8 23. Rd5d7+ Kf6 24. Rd1d6+ Kg5 25. Nc4 Re8 26. Kf2 h5 27. Rg7 h4 28. Rgxg6+ Kh5 29. Ne3 {To avoid the king escape in f5}
