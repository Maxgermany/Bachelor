1. d4 {Hello my name is Fred McGriff and I'm a retired baseball professional. } g6 {It's been a while since I haven't seen 1..d5.  I am already expecting to lose.} 2. c4 {I ignore the problem and proceed as normal hoping for a (perhaps impossible?) transposition somewhere down the road into QGA, the only thing I know.} Bg7 3. Nc3 {Still pretending like I don't notice the fianchetto} d6 4. e4 {I reckon I need to take control of the center now.  I begrudingly do as I've been told.} Nd7 5. Nf3 {I'm dying to castle right now.  I feel very uncomfortable and naked. } e5 {Well here it comes, a direct attack on my D guy.  I knew we couldn't just stay friends and move around on the board forever.} 6. Bg5 {I want him to move his f pawn up to block in the G bishop.  Shot in the dark.} f6 {To my surprise, black does what I wanted.  I thought for sure Ngf6 would be the move.  But I guess it's right to put pressure on my bish here too.} 7. Be3 {I don't mind moving the bish back because I've seen it done by the masters.  So right now I feel like a master, moving him back and forth.} Ne7 8. Bd3 {White castles sound good right now} O-O {I imagine Black Castle would be like Krystal's.  } 9. O-O {At this point I could put down about 9 or 10 sliders, White Castle or Krystal I don't care.  Kobeyeshi (sp) endorses Krystal's so I'm leaning that way right now, plus there's one close to my home.  The only White Castles around here are in the frozen section of Stop n Shop.} a6 10. Qb3 {Threatening a c5  here.  I am really clever.} Kh8 {He sees right through me like it was nothing at all.  I think I read somewhere that it's good to have the king cornered so I think this is a good play on my part.  I really have no idea. } 11. a3 {I usually do a3 when I'm not sure what else to do.} f5 12. Bg5 {Pinning the donkey to the Queen.  } exd4 13. Ne2 {Well he's up a pawn but now I'm threatening to recover it with both my donkeys} c5 {Okay so nevermind, that pawn is pretty much lost.} 14. exf5 {I like this move because it frees up the E File.  I do like the fact that I'm messing with the pawns around his king.} gxf5 {He can't do Nxf5 because of the queen pin.} 15. Rfe1 {Jockeying the rook over to the pawn-free E File.} Nf6 16. Ng3 {Gearing up for some kingside war over here with the weak pawn structure   freeing up the E file} Qc7 17. Nh4 {Both my donkeys are threatening f5 plus this moves me into an on-deck check.} h6 {Black is threatening my bishop but now I'm dimly aware that I have some sort of opportunity here with the h donkey.     } 18. Rxe7 {Rxe7!  One of my better moves. } Qxe7 {Best case scenario for me.  Black was probably asleep and I lucked out.} 19. Ng6+ {Well at this point I'm licking my chops.} Kh7 20. Nxe7 hxg5 {Still only  3?  Guess I'm not really home free.} 21. Nxc8 b5 {He doesnt take the ..Rxc8 22.bxf5  bait} 22. Bxf5+ {At this point I'm just trying to take some material and making sure I am okay before I go in for the mate.  } Kh8 23. Nxd6 Rab8 24. cxb5 axb5 25. Nf7+ Kg8 26. Nxg5+ c4 27. Qf3 b4 28. Be6+ Kh8 29. Bxc4 bxa3 30. bxa3 Rb2 31. Ng3e4 Rfb8 32. Qh3+ {forced from here on... time for those white castles.  } Nh5 33. Qxh5+ Bh6 34. Qxh6# {}
