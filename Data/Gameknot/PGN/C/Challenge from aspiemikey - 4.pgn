1. e4 e5 2. f3 d5 {I learned my lesson from last time, instead of unleashing my queen to check the king, I moved up her pawn to open her up from another side, and also her bishop. And I also pressure my opponent's pawn.} 3. d4 {He does likewise...} dxe4 {...so I capture his king's pawn in the hope that he'd do the same...} 4. dxe5 {...which he does, to open up the d-file...} Qxd1+ {...allowing me to remove his queen...} 5. Kxd1 {...forcing him to take mine, so he can't castle.} exf3 {Now I accept another pawn...} 6. Nxf3 {...but lose mine.} Bg4 {Now I bring up the bishop to pin the knight down...} 7. Be2 {...so he unleashes his bishop to unpin the knight...} Nc6 {...and I release my knight...} 8. h3 O-O-O+ {...so I can castle queenside and place him in check.} 9. Bd2 Bxf3 {Now I remove the knight...} 10. Bxf3 {...at the expense of my bishop...} Nxe5 {...and I also remove the exposed pawn...} 11. b3 Nxf3 {...and the bishop...} 12. gxf3 {...in exchange for my knight.} Nf6 {Now I bring up my knight...} 13. Nc3 {...and as he brings up his...} Bb4 {...I do likewise to my bishop to guarantee a win of at least one of the knight and the bishop.} 14. Kc1 {Although he unpins his bishop...} Ba3+ {...his king is attacked by mine...} 15. Kd1 Bb2 {...and now I fork the rook and knight.} 16. Rb1 {He saves his rook...} Bxc3 {...so I accept the knight.} 17. b4 Rxd2+ {Now I bring my rook onto the attack...} 18. Kc1 Rf2 {...and line up a pawn...} 19. Rb3 Rxf3 {...which I remove, also covering my bishop.} 20. Rd1 {He moves his other rook out...} Rd8 {...so I contest the open file.} 21. Rd3 {Doubling up on the bishop is fatal...} Rf1+ {...as I push my furthest rook to the top rank...} 22. Rd1 {...forcing him to block with his...} Rdxd1# {...but that shield is easily shattered by my other rook.}
