1. e4 {Another "wild game", with an interesting counter trick.} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. d4 e5 4. Nc3 {Stronger for white is Nf3. The other answer is Bb4, but I played...} Qxd4 {Which allows a "trick" by white. } 5. Qxd4 exd4 6. Nb5 {So white recovers the pawn, while I have to defend c7. But I went for a wild game, as always.} Bb4+ {If c3, dxc3, and Nxc7+, Kd8, NxR is answered by c3xb2+, winning. So, } 7. Kd1 {No rook available for the e column, so I have to defend. } Na6 8. Nxd4 {...planning to take advantage of the pinned knight. But I have to free the way for the rook, first. So I proposed another exchange. } Bg4+ 9. f3 {As predicted. } O-O-O {If c3, Bf5.} 10. fxg4 {But he went for the exchange. } Rxd4+ 11. Bd3 {So I can take the g4 pawn, and the game goes on. But I tried something stronger, again. } Nc5 {I threat the exchange, and avoid the annoying BxN (future) threat.} 12. Ke2 {Wise is to defend from c3, but again, I tried to be "creative" and "attacking". } Nf6 {This is more to free my rook. It looks as I have a huge edge. } 13. h3 {Better was Nf3, attacking the rook - but releasing me from the potential threat c3.} Re8+ {Yahoo! Every piece is in the game...} 14. Be3 Nd5 {I mean "every" :-)} 15. Bf5+ Kb8 16. c3 {Nf3 was better, again. } Rxe3+ 17. Kf2 Rd2+ 18. Kf1 {Nf4 attacks g2, but... is this enough? The wise choice was Ba5, but I bet again.} Bxc3 19. bxc3 g6 20. Bb1 {Now Rd1+, Kf2, Nd3+, BxN, RxR allowed c4, Rxd3, cxN, Rxd... but I had time troubles. } Nxc3 {It looks SOOOO overwhelming...} 21. Nf3 {And here I blundered badly. Was this position winning for black? Yes, probably. I show the following. } Rd1+ 22. Kf2 Re2+ 23. Kg3 Rxh1 {and white is lost. I didn't play this, actually, but this was the right way.}
