1. Nf3 {1. Nf3 is an interesting alternative to the conventional opening moves. Called the Reti opening, named after Mr Richard Reti. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9ti_Opening} d5 {So I counter conventionally.} 2. c4 {This move makes it a Reti, rather than, say d3 or g3 going into a King's Indian Reversed.} c6 {So I just protect my d5 pawn, rather than risk a Benoni reversed with d4-d5. e7-e6, also supporting the d pawn with e7-e6 is also perfectly playable, but blocks in the Bishop on c8.} 3. g3 {White heads towards a sort of King's Indian Reversed set up.} g6 {I copy him - for now!} 4. Bg2 {He completes the fianchetto. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto} Bg7 {And so do I.} 5. cxd5 {He takes - I very much like this move for black - it means my Nb8 can be developed at its best square, c6.} cxd5 {I take back.} 6. O-O {And what is this? He is allowing me to take control of the centre....} e5 {Which I immediately do...} 7. d3 {Now this is looking more like a King's Indian Defence reversed, more than ever. White formation is also similar to the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Dragon_Variation Now against both those set-ups, an effective attacking set-up is f2-f3, Be3, Qd2, 0-0-0, h2-h4-h5, so ideally I would like to do something similar here, even though g7-g6 and Bf8-g7 don't really fit in with that plan.} Ne7 {For now I develop my knights.} 8. Nc3 {The logical square for his Nb1.} Nbc6 {And this one too.} 9. Bd2 {Now 0-0 is the natural move to play. After the game I looked up this position on the Gameknot databases. 9...0-0 is the only move on it. However, I had my idea, so I went with it.} f6 {This seems crazy, to block in my Bg7, but I want my Bc8 on e6, and I don't want him to be able to attack it with Nf3-g5. What do you think of the move f7-f6 dear reader? Would you have played it? Or would you have played 0-0? Or something else?} 10. Rc1 {Normal development.} Be6 {I continue with my plan.} 11. a3 {He gets ready for the push, b2-b4-b5} g5 {This was played with the idea of meeting b2-b4 with Ng6 and b4-b5 with Nc6-e7.} 12. e3 {He told me afterwards that the idea of this was that he could play b2-b4-b5 without the fear of me playing d5-d4 and Ne7-d5-c3. At the time I was pleased to see this move, I didn't think it achieved much.} Ng6 {So I carry on with my plan.} 13. Na4 {And this is a thematic manoeuvre. If Qd7 he replies with Nc5 and he exchanges off my Be6 and end of attack for me! } Bf8 {So instead I prepare to give up my other bishop for the knight.} 14. Nc5 {He comes in anyway.} Bxc5 {I take.} 15. Rxc5 {He takes back.} Qd7 {And I finally get Qd7 in.} 16. b4 {Now of course, if 0-0-0 then he plays b4-b5 and my Nc6 can't move, and I lose knight for pawn - too big a lose for my liking.} a6 {I was thinking that maybe I could play 0-0-0 after all, or maybe if he continues with b4-b5 I can exchange pawns on b5 and have a nice open line for my rook. Maybe I should have just got on with my attack. What do you think dear reader?} 17. Qc1 {Again this is quite thematic, doubling on the c file. If I let him, he can play a3-a4, b4-b5, and after my knight on c6 moves, Rc7 is strong for him. I considered 17.....0-0-0 and came to the conclusion that my king would be under great risk for instance O-O-O 18. a4 Kb8 19. b5 axb5 20. axb5 Nce7 and my king is looking very draughty, with White having both c and a files to attack down. So I decided to just get on with my attack. I'd love to play Be6-h3 here, and exchange his Bg2, which is a good defender. However Bh3 18.	Bxh3	Qxh3 19. Rxd5 drops a pawn. So I decided on another move.} h5 {I was expecting the continuation 18. a4 Qh7 19. b5 axb5 20. axb5 Nce7 21. Rc7 and thinking that I may give up the b pawn and carry on with my attack, but instead of 18. a4 he played...} 18. h4 {This can be a good way of slowing down this sort of attack that I have going, but in this position, it just leads to defeat.} gxh4 {I open up the position a little.} 19. gxh4 {He takes back.} Bh3 {OK stop - what is white main threat in this position?} 20. Qd1 {This fails to meet the threat, but I think black is lost anyway. OK find White's next move?} Qg4 {Did you get it dear reader? The only way now for white to avoid Qxg2 mate is Ne1, which loses queen on d1. So White resigned. Many thanks for reading. Please rate this annotation, and leave a comment or two! Until next time dear reader!}
