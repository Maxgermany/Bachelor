1. e4 {I chose this game to demonstrate that while many lines in the Philidor are equal, they contain quite a bit of tension, besides being pretty unbalanced.} d6 {One of two possible move orders to reach the Philidor Defence. This move order is known as the Philidor Hanham and I favour it over the classical move order with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 because of the interesting and often fairly sharp lines with f4 or g4.} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 {Black can also play 3...e5 here but then they have to be prepared to play an equal endgame with few winning chances after 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8.} 4. Be3 e5 5. h3 Be7 6. Nge2 c6 {Preparing a future ...d5 and threatening ...b5.} 7. a4 {Preventing 7...b5.} O-O 8. g4 {Dubbed the Archbishop Attack by James Vigus in his book The Pirc in Black and White, inspired by Canterbury where he was staying while studying it, this line has also been tried against the Philidor with the 1...d6 move order.} d5 {Dissolving the centre and also solving the threat of 9.g5.} 9. Bg2 {Taking on either e5 or d5 is probably good for black, so instead white focuses on development.} exd4 10. Bxd4 Nxe4 11. Nxe4 dxe4 12. Bxe4 Nc5 13. Bg2 Ne6 {The knight stands well on e6.} 14. Be3 Qc7 15. O-O Bd7 {Black has equalized.} 16. c3 Rad8 17. Qc2 c5 {Intending to exchange light squared bishops by 18...Bc6 and 19...Bxg2.} 18. c4 {Taking control of the d5-square that Black surrendered with 17...c5.} Bc6 {Continuing with the plan.} 19. Nc3 Bxg2 20. Kxg2 {White´s king is a bit airy after the exchange of the light squared bishops.} Nf4+ 21. Bxf4 {The knight will be pretty annoying on f4, so white does best to get rid of it.} Qxf4 22. Nd5 Qg5 23. f4 Qh4 24. Qe4 {The knight is very strong on d5, so white sees no reason to exchange it for the bishop.} Bf6 25. Rfe1 {Capturing on b2 was not really a threat as white wins back the pawn and gets to put a rook on the seventh rank after 24...Bxb2 25.Rab1. Note also that 25.g5? was impossible due to 25...Bxg5.} h6 {In light of white´s vulnerable king position, an exchange of queen for two rooks is feasible for black, but first I need to create luft for my king.} 26. Re2 {Preparing to triple on the e-file and also protecting the b2-pawn.} Rfe8 27. Qxe8+ Rxe8 28. Rxe8+ Kh7 29. Re2 Bd4 {Both minor pieces now have good squares.} 30. Ra3 Qd8 {Reactivating the queen.} 31. a5 Bf6 {Lacking a plan, I chose to wait by repeating moves.} 32. Rb3 {In order to reach the seventh rank white has to give up the a-pawn in return for the black b-pawn.} Bd4 {So as not to allow white to cripple my kingside pawn structure by taking the bishop on f6.} 33. Rxb7 Qxa5 {An interesting strategical struggle has commenced, with black trying to exploit white´s weak king position with the queen and the bishop while white will try to infiltrate by doubling rooks on the seventh rank.} 34. f5 {If 34. Rxf7 then 34...Qa2 35.Rc2 Qb3 or 35.Ne3 Bxe3 36.Rxe3 wins back the pawn, in the latter case with a likely repetition of moves.} Qa6 {Better than the immediate 34...Qa1, as the rook will have to get off the seventh rank in order to protect the c4-pawn.} 35. Rb5 Qa1 {I could have opted for a repetition with 35...Qa2 36.Rc2 Qb1 37.Re2 Qa2, etc. In light of my chosen continuation 35...Qa2 36.Rc2 Qa1 would probably have been more accurate, as the rook stands worse on the closed c-file than on the open e-file, from where it is able to join its´ comrade to double on the seventh rank.} 36. Nf4 {Protecting the rook in view of the threat 36...Qg1+ 37.Kf3 Qf1+ 38.Ke4 (or 38.Kg3) 38...Qxe2+.} Qg1+ 37. Kf3 Qh1+ {Preventing the king from escaping through e4.} 38. Kg3 {38.Rg2 is bad in view of 38...Qf1+ 39.Kg3 Qxc4.} f6 {Putting the f-pawn under protection, enabling ...Be5 while also limiting the white king´s escape squares.} 39. Ng2 Be5+ 40. Kh4 Qc1 {Threatening 40...Qg5#.} 41. Ne3 Qg1 {Threatening 42...Qg3+ 43.Kh5 Qxh3#.} 42. Kh5 {42.Ng2 would probably lead to a repetition.} Qg3 43. h4 Bf4 {With mating threats after 44...Bg5.} 44. Ng2 {Protecting against the mate on h4.} Bg5 45. Rb7 Bxh4 {With 46...Qf4 coming with the threat of 47...Qg5#, white´s position looks lost, but haddibje has a magnificent save prepared.} 46. Nxh4 Qf4 47. Rxg7+ {!} Kxg7 48. Re7+ Kg8 {Not 48...Kf8?? 49.Ng6+ +-.} 49. Re8+ Kf7 50. Re7+ {And here´s the whole idea. Black cannot take the rook because then 51.Ng6+ wins the queen and the game.} Kg8 51. Re8+ Kf7 {}
