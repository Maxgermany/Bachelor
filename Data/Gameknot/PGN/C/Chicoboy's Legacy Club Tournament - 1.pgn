1. e4 {I'm not at all surprised that he played this as it's most common.} c5 {Of course, I play my usual Siclian.} 2. d4 {I thought that he would play the most common move which would be 2.Nf3, and then after 2...d6, he'd played this.  Not a problem, however, as I'm used to seeing this.  This is the morra gambit, which I accept since, even if and when he takes back, it becomes an exchange, and unless I know exactly when, my idea is still, as long as even, exchange early and often against stronger players.} cxd4 3. c3 {Of course, as I recently learned from GM Susan Polgar, of course, after this game, it's about planning and strategy.  He wants to exchange pawns, but I don't know why.  Seeing he has a plan and might get something out of it, I don't allow it.} e5 {Instead, I try to do something about my doubled pawns.  I think I see his plan, and although not problematic, I'm still not crazy about it, which is, no wonder, why I declined.  The idea is that, if I take his c pawn, he gets to develop his c N, right away, and it might even become more mobile and strengthen.  Well, I don't allow it because Jack has told me that you can't let a N get too strong or powerful.  And, you can't let it advance too far, as otherwise, it'll cause problems.  In a game that I lost, he showed an example and how letting that N become too powerful became the costly mistake.  Keeping that in mind, I play this.} 4. Nf3 {That does not stop ION from developing his other N, however.  I'm not surprised, however.} Nc6 {Meanwhile, I continue my development.} 5. cxd4 {So, he takes.  I'm not surprised because I knew that white would get his pawn back since the Morra Gambit is not a real Gambit, afterall.  It's, in fact, a similar circumstance to the QGA.} Bb4+ {Determining to put pressure right on the K side, I put him right in check.  I also keep in mind that I can lead to an even exchange of pieces which I go for since I'm up against an expert.} 6. Bd2 {What I anticipated.  Had he placed his N there, however, I would've given second thought about the exchange.  But, I'm just going by what Mr. Stockel has taught me.} Bxd2+ 7. Qxd2 {I thought he'd follow guidelines an capture with his undeveloped N.  But, experts can deviate, though.  In this position, however, I already thought that I had a slight edge with this deviation.  So, now, I just keep exchanging, as everything still comes out even.} exd4 8. Nxd4 Nxd4 9. Qxd4 Nf6 {?! This, however, is where I wind up getting myself into trouble.  This is where I hyperfocus on development since the idea is, as Carlson taught, develop your pieces, get the K to safety, and control the center.  Now, as I still must be specific, GAC showed a game in a private annotation where a GM did not do that any of that, violated all the principles, and wound up losing quickly.  I kept that in mind and decided that I didn't want to end up like that GM.  So, I figured that this was best.  But, what I had to keep to in mind, which I forgot here is that there are exceptions to the guidelines, which sometimes you can't follow, if a threat looms.  I overlooked it.  And, while this is not a passer, I learned something as I always thought it required a passed pawn.  What I learned is that you don't need a passer for a pawn to be considered dangerous.  I overlooked that, and hyperfocusing on opening guidelines has left this N en-prise.  However, it is worse then it appears, as I'm about to explain.} 10. e5 Nh5 {?? At the time, I thought that the most important principle was not bringing the Q out too early.  However, this was shortly before the lesson that I got with Susan.  The most important is actually a N being grim.  This is where it really applies.  "try to avoid having pieces undefended."  That is the exact blunder here.  But, I only had one choice which I didn't like that because it required undeveloping the N back to g8, making it more difficult to castle, and impossible to do so, K side.  But, the only option was 10...Ng8, in this position because this move loses a piece.  And, it is because of the fact that N is on the edge (end file.)  Had I played the right move, however, white would still have an advantage because white is better placed.} 11. g4 {It starts with this move.} Qc7 {Seeing what he's about to move, I start coming out with a nasty plan, which is a little unsound.  But, doing whatever I can to stay in, even if, it's unsound aggression.  So, the idea is that he can take, and when he does, I mate.  I know that he won't allow it, but the idea is gaining tempo, while I attempt to figure out what I can do.  Unfortunately, there is nothing, but this does delay his plan, which was, in part, my goal.} 12. Nc3 {Not surprised by this move.} g6 {Knowing that he will get a piece, I won't give it for free.  Now, when takes, I take back, and despite being down, I get a pawn, in return.  That's still better then a free piece.  Nontheless, it makes it unsafe to castle, which puts me at a greater disadvantage.} 13. gxh5 gxh5 14. e6 {Although not a passer, with my other two pawns, this one is just as dangerous, as I will explain.} O-O {?? I really didn't want to castle here with the, "inferior pawn structure."  That only leaves me with 14...Rf8, after which, he would not only have a passed pawn, but promote.  Now, had analyzed 14...Rf8.  Therefore, I was either going to castle, or play this move. But, he would play 15.e7.  So, either he promotes, or to prevent that, I must capture.  But, if I had taken that pawn, I'd would be placed in check in with the Q.  After which, he would have won it and caused a lot of damage, shortly after.  However, this loses much more quickly because this gives ION a mate in two starting with his next move.} 15. Rg1+ {I discovered it here, and therefore, resigned.  That is because 15...Qg3 is forced, after which he mates with 16.Rxg3#  In this game, we have learned that, first, there are exceptions to guidelines.  And, they must be broken, not only if a piece is captured or you get mated, but when it leaves a piece en-prise, that's when you must deviate, and play something else to prevent the threat.  Second, the most important principle is not to place the N on the rim, unless absolutely needed because, similar to the game with Karpov, 10...Nh5 lost a piece, which soon after, sealed my fate.}
