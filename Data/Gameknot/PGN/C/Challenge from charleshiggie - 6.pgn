1. e4 {This was the first of a number of "Calendar Challenges". The all-female team "~Sixth Sense~" have made a calendar featuring some of the ladies in the team. I am hoping to play all the players featured on the calendar.} c5 {So I start with my usual - The Sicilian Defence.} 2. Bc4 {Slightly unusual reply.} e6 {So this blunts the Bishop's scope.} 3. Nf3 {White decides to switch to the normal open variation after all.} Nc6 {I usually meet Nf3 with Nc6, challenging the same central squares, e5 and d4.} 4. d4 {She opens up the game} cxd4 {I take} 5. Nxd4 {She takes back} Nf6 {I hit the e pawn} 6. Bg5 {She saves the pawn by pinning the knight, but this runs into....} Qa5+ {This check, which also hits the bishop on g4. Now she can't put the queen in the way, as I simply exchange queens and take the knight on d4, so the only way to save the pieces is....} 7. Bd2 {This move, which unprotects the Nd4, but I can't take it immediately as my queen is attacked, so....} Qc5 {Now I am threatening both the knight on d4 and the bishop on c4. Now the only way for Black to save the piece is Nxc6, and although black's position is not very good, at least material balance is maintained, for instance, 8.	Nxc6	Qxc4 9. Na5 Qxe4+ 10.	Kf1 b6 11. Nb3	Bb7 12. f3 Qf5 was sasusa (1643) vs. chesshub (2339) which black won in 24.} 8. c3 {This just leaves the bishop hanging.} Qxc4 {So i just take it.} 9. b3 {She hits my queen} Qd3 {So I advance my queen} 10. Qe2 {She offers the queen exchange} Qxe2+ {So I just take.} 11. Nxe2 {She takes back} Nxe4 {Now I have an extra pawn too.} 12. O-O {She castles} Bc5 {I put pressure on f2} 13. Be3 {She blocks} Bxe3 {I take} 14. fxe3 {She takes back} b6 {I decide to develop my bishop on c8} 15. Na3 {Her knight comes out} Ba6 {Nice diagonal for my extra bishop} 16. c4 {Which she blocks} Ke7 {I connect my rooks. My king is quite safe in the centre with queens off the board.} 17. Rf4 {She hits my knight} f5 {I defend it} 18. Rb1 {I am not sure of the point of this move, maybe she had dreams of b3-b4-b5} g5 {I advance on the other wing, hitting her rook} 19. Rff1 {The rook comes back} Nd2 {Now I fork her rooks, one of them is lost} 20. Rbc1 {She decides to keep the Rb1} Nxf1 {So I take the other one} 21. Kxf1 {She takes back} Nb4 {I hit a2} 22. Nc3 {She defends} Rhd8 {I get ready to by d7-d5 following by opening the d file for my rooks.} 23. Kg1 {Strange move. With queens on the board, this would be a good safety move, but in this position the kings are safe enough in the centre. Ke2 would have been better, stopping my rook invasion which follows.} d5 {So I open the d file, also possibly increasing the scope of my Ba6} 24. h3 {Not sure why she played this.} dxc4 {So I take} 25. bxc4 {She takes back} Rd2 {My rook invades} 26. Ncb5 {Is this some sort of counter-attack? Is she hoping for Nc7 forking my rook on a8 and my bishop on a6?} Bb7 {This stops that and threatens g2} 27. c5 {Not sure why she plays this either.} Rxg2+ {So g2 goes} 28. Kf1 {King comes back towards the centre.} Rd8 {Now I just need to get the other one into action to finish her off.} 29. Nxa7 {This is another blunder, but white was lost anyway, it is mate soon} Rdd2 {Doubled rooks on the second rank are very powerful} 30. Nc4 {She hits my rook} Rdf2+ {I check} 31. Ke1 {Forced!} Nd3+ {Another check} 32. Kd1 {Another forced move} Rf1# {And this time it is mate. Many thanks for reading this dear reader.
