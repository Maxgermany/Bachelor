1. b3 {I illustrate this game to emphasise- never give up.  On move 26  I lost a bishop due to sloppy playing. After that I concentrated on attacking his king by advancing a pawn right up and by getting my queen and 2 rooks over. Sure, a player of 1700 rating would have seen through it, but for some of us whose rating hovers between 1550 and 1600 will enjoy this game. (More entertainment than education ) } e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e4 Bb4 4. Nf3 d6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. d3 Bg4 7. Be2 {pretty routine so far} Nd4 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. Bxc3 Nxe2 10. Qxe2 {his exchanges so far have not made much sense} O-O 11. h3 {I want to drive his bishop away} Bxf3 12. Qxf3 c5 13. O-O b5 14. Bb2 a5 {Unfortunately I wake up late to his pawn advance into my territory} 15. Qe3 {I move my queen out of the way to advance the f pawn} Qc7 16. f4 Nd7 17. f5 Rab8 18. Rf3 {the rook lift} c4 19. d4 f6 20. Rg3 Rf7 {bad strategy on my part- see my bishop locked in } 21. Rc1 Nb6 22. Qc3 Ra8 23. d5 Qa7 {masked attack on my king} 24. Kh2 {I move my king out} Rc8 25. b4 {now it is getting messy for me} Na4 {knights are my weak point, I have lost my bishop} 26. Qd2 Nxb2 27. c3 Na4 28. h4 {pawn advance starts and a plan is forming in my desperate brain- will it work} axb4 29. axb4 Nb6 30. h5 {pawn goes up, up} Ra8 {I have to be careful about his moves on the left flank} 31. h6 {what will he do, this pawn must be beginning to annoy him} Qe7 {Not sure why he does that- now he feels a bit of pressure} 32. Rf1 {rook comes over to join attack} Ra3 {he is putting pressure on my c pawn- I lose that, his pawn will become queen} 33. Rg4 Qa7 34. Qe3 Ra2 35. Rh4 Qb8 36. Rf3 {attack on his king building up} Qc7 {He reinforces his g7 pawn} 37. Rfh3 {rooks line up- } Na4 38. Qf3 {I plan queen move to h5- have you spotted what that would do?} Qa7 39. Qh5 {if my q can get in on e8} Nb2 40. hxg7 {Too late for him- if he takes the pawn with his rook, my queen will move to e8 and mate him} Kxg7 41. Qxh7+ {only a matter of time now} Kf8 {the end is near} 42. Qh8+ {if he moves king to e7, my rooks will come to h7. He resigns. gctbob and I have had good games. This game shows never give up- sometimes you can cook up a strategy that the other wakes up to, too late. Hope you enjoyed this.}
