1. e4 {This was a random challenge and my opponents rating was very close to mine. I have annotated it in the hope that more skilful players can suggest more efficient ways that it could have come to a conclusion} e5 2. c4 Nc6 3. a3 {Kings Pawn game, I don't know this variant at all but I am already looking at the hole at d4} Nf6 4. Nc3 Bc5 {Strengthening the centre, I am also expecting white to castle on the kingside so I want my dsb on the a7-g1 diagonal} 5. Nf3 d6 {I thought about this move for a while, it seems very passive to me but it does bolster my e5 pawn and open a line for my lsb} 6. d3 {This was a pleasant surprise as I was expecting d4, the text makes it difficult for whites lsb. It was about this time that I was starting to form a plan, although I have not completed my development yet, I am ready to castle, and white isn't, so I decided to try to take him by surprise and attack aggressively} Ng4 7. h3 {It's hard to know for sure what whites best move is here but I don't think this is it} Bxf2+ {This is quite nasty for white as his king has few options.} 8. Ke2 Nd4+ 9. Kd2 {If Nxd4, exd4 and then the knight on g4 is immune due to hxg4, Bxg4+ winning the queen} Ne3 {This move was to force the queen away from the defence of the king, I am not worried about a check on a4 as it is easily parried. This was partly a distraction in the hope that I would get the opportunity to move some of my pieces into better positions, in particular my lsb and queen.} 10. Qa4+ Bd7 11. Nb5 {Note that Qb4 gives N (either) c2 forking the queen and rook} a6 12. Nfxd4 axb5 13. Qb3 exd4 {Note that whites position is very cramped indeed and I am trying to tighten the screw even more} 14. Ke2 {Threatens both the knight and the dsb, white is starting to fight back but it could be too late} Qh4 15. Bxe3 Bg4+ {Keeping the pressure up, perhaps better would have been dxe3} 16. Kd2 bxc4 {This exchange was to try to get the queen off the third rank where it might have been able to hinder my attack} 17. Qxc4 Bxe3+ {Taking with the bishop keeps the king confined and allows my queen in} 18. Kc2 Qf2+ 19. Kb1 {Looking to get the king safer in a2} Be6 {Pressures the queen again and prevents Ka2.} 20. Qb4 {This is a nice move from white that limits my options} c5 {Pressuring white again, I am expecting a series of checks but they are going to have to run out sooner or later} 21. Qb5+ Ke7 {links the rooks in case of Qxb7} 22. Qxb7+ Kf6 {Now I am looking at a future Rb8} 23. Be2 {white sacrifices the bishop to get a rook active} Qxe2 24. b3 {Prevents the threat of Qxd3#} Rhb8 25. e5+ dxe5 {This is not a good move as we will see, at the time I was happy to undouble my pawns} 26. Qf3+ {A nice move from white that I had completely overlooked, fortunately for me I am still in a strong position} Qxf3 {forced} 27. gxf3 Rxb3+ 28. Kc2 {This is the point where I start to struggle a little to make good moves, I am trying to trap the white king on the back row so that the rooks are no longer linked. If I can use my bishops to do that I can bring a rook in for mate} Rc3+ 29. Kd1 Bb3+ {Would Rxd3  be better here?  that is the square I would like my lsb on} 30. Ke2 Rc2+ 31. Kf1 c4 32. dxc4 Bxc4+ 33. Ke1 Bd2+ {I can't remember why I did this, my plan was Rxa3, the rook is immune due to Rc1#} 34. Kd1 d3 35. Rh2 Bc3 {If white decides to exchange he will have almost nothing left} 36. Rc1 Rxc1+ 37. Kxc1 Rxa3 {Threatens Ra1#} 38. Rb2 {and white resigned.   Thanks for reading please comment}
