[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 {This was played in a friendly match Malpas v Crewe. } e5 {it start conventionally enough.} 2. Bc4 {A good move developing the bishop.} Nf6 {A sound developing move by black, attacking the pawn on e4.} 3. Qf3 {Not the best way to defend the pawn. Bringing the queen out early can leave her open to attack. 3. d3 or 3. Nc3 are both better.} c6 {Preparing d7-d5. I prefer 3....Nc6 here with the possibility of driving the Qf3 back to d1 with Nc6-d4 attacking both the queen on f3 and the pawn on c2.} 4. Nc3 {The best move for white by far, protecting e4 again and attacking the d5 square making it impossible for black to play d7-d5 without losing a pawn.  } Bb4 {A good developing move by black, also threatening to capture on c3 and then play d7-d5} 5. Nge2 {And this is a good reply by white. If black takes on c3 now, white simply recaptures with the knight on e2, keeping the pressure on the d5 square. } O-O {Black castles, a good move.} 6. O-O {And a good move by white too.} d6 {A good developing move by black, preparing to develop the Bc8 to g4.} 7. d4 {This is an interesting move. 7. h3 is the move which was played in both the games I have on my opening database with this position. Having said that, the move d2-d4 has its merits. It prepares to develop the Bc1 and gains space in the centre. However My computer (Fritz)prefers 7. a3 or 7. Bb3} Bg4 {Black comes out with bishop, attacking the queen, a good move.} 8. Qd3 {The best square to put the queen, so as to not block the Bc1.} Nbd7 {Black carries on developing. This is good. } 9. dxe5 {Oops! this is a dreadful move, losing a bishop. Fritz prefers 9. Ng3 or 9. Bg5} Nxe5 {The problem is now white has queen and bishop attacked. The only queen move to maintain the protection of the bishop is 10. Qd4 but then Bb4-c5! and the queen has no where to run to - a common fate if the queen is brought out too early. White is going to lose her bishop, so best is now Bxf7+ and at least get a pawn for it.} 10. Qg3 {The queen run here.} Nxc4 {Black duly takes the bishop} 11. b3 {White attacks the knight.} Bxe2 {Before moving the knight, black does this exchange. It is a good idea generally to exchange pieces, but not pawns, if materially ahead, but in this case it is slightly questionable as the Bishop on g4 was more active than the knight on e2.} 12. Nxe2 {White of course back, clearly the best move.} Na3 {Now if black had played this a move previously, white would have had difficulty in defending the pawn on c2 - in fact it would have been impossible, and so to avoid losing the c pawn white would have had to take the knight on a3 with her bishop. As it is, white has a strong reply.} 13. c3 {An excellent move by white! There is no a real danger that black will lose his extra piece. For instance, 13. ...Ba5? 14. Bxa3! There was however an equally good move in this position for white, namely 13. Bh6! with the threat of Qxg7 mate! Black can defend with 13...Ne8! and then white can play 14. c3} Nxe4 {Black takes the pawn, attacking the queen.} 14. Qf4 {This unfortunately is a mistake. 14. Qd3 was called for, keeping the double protection of knight and queen on the pawn on c3. } Nxc3 {Black now has material advantage of bishop and two pawns.} 15. Ng3 {White correctly avoids exchanges.} Nd5 {Clever move by black, protecting the bishop and attacking the queen.} 16. Qg4 {Queen has to move again. White is cleverly planning an attack on g7.} Nc2 {Black attacks the rook, a good idea, but there was a much better move at black's disposal here, namely 16. Qf6! attacking the rook on a1 and also nullifying white's attempted to attack the black king.} 17. Bb2 {An excellent move by white, threatening mate.} Nf6 {Black defends against the mate, and attacks the white queen.} 18. Qc4 {White moves the queen. fritz agrees that this is the best move for white here.} Nxa1 {Knight takes the rook.} 19. Qxb4 {White correctly takes back the more active bishop, rather than the knight on a1 which is trapped behind enemy lines and lost anyway.} Nc2 {The knight tries to come out.} 20. Qc4 {A good square to put the queen where it attacks the knight.} Qe7 {Black develops the queen.} 21. Qxc2 {The knight goes.} Rfe8 {A good move by black, taking full control of the e file.} 22. Qf5 {Perhaps white is intending to exchange on f6 to weaken the black pawns?} Qe6 {Black offers the queen exchange.} 23. Qg5 {Which white correctly declines.} Re7 {Perhaps black is planning to triple on the e file?} 24. Rd1 {White develops her rook. I'd be tempted to play 24. h3 here, to avoid the back rank mate that happens.} h6 {Black attacks the queen.} 25. Qf4 {Queen drops back.} Nh5 {This is a very clever move by black. If 26. Nxh5?? black as a mate - Qe1+ 27.	Rxe1	Rxe1# so white cannot take.} 26. Qh4 {So the queen moves. } Nxg3 {Black takes} 27. Qxg3 {A disaster! Taking with the h pawn and white is still in the game.} Qe1+ {Now it is over.} 28. Rxe1 {White takes.} Rxe1# {And black mates. Many thanks for reading my annotation.
