[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 {English, I used to despise both playing and playing against this opening but, as with most openings, by playing it and playing against it more I have come to view it in a slightly better light by finding lines I enjoy. } Nf6 {I don't enjoy the reversed Sicilian positions as much and want to try to open the game up if possible. } 2. g3 c6 {Looking to contest the bishop's diagonal and aiming to push d5. } 3. Bg2 d5 {Why wait? } 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. Nc3 g6 {Aiming to control the center as well and castle quickly. Still in my opening database. } 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. d4 {Structure is nearly symmetrical but Black's turn to move now, not sure yet if I want to play the b8 knight on the king or queenside I play...} Ne4 {A more immediate line aggressively posting the knight. } 9. Qc2 {This move was not in my database, although Qb3 was. I decided to stay aggressive. } Bf5 10. Qb3 {Since Bf5 was not a response to Qb3 we have not transposed back into my database. The queen double attacks the pawns on d5 and b7. } Qd7 {Looking to protect the b7 pawn and a8 rook} 11. Nxd5 {This pawn looks double attacked but White cannot take. The knight will now be pinned to the Queen and after 11. Qxd5 Nxc3 White is in trouble since 12. Qxd7 Nxe3+ comes with check} Be6 12. Nxe7+ {escapes with two pawns for the piece. } Qxe7 13. d5 Bf5 {The pawn on d5 isn't isolated but it's hanging and lonely, black has a lot of open lines to press with and will soon recover some pawns. } 14. Nh4 Nd6 {After 14... Bd7 15. Qe3 black's feeling the pressure. } 15. Bd2 {Looking to connect the rooks and finish development, trying to pin the knight with Bb4.} Na6 {The knight needs to be developed and the bishop may need to be retreated to d7 in the near future. } 16. e4 {White either drops or gambits a pawn, but Black is up to the task. } Bxe4 17. Bxe4 Qxe4 18. Rfe1 Qc4 {Looking to trade queens before things get ugly. } 19. Bc3 Qxb3 {Not worried about losing the DSB as much if the queens are off the board, and gives me a chance to double White's Queenside pawns } 20. axb3 Nc5 21. Bb4 b6 22. Bxc5 bxc5 {A weaker pawn, but White's d5 is isolated and b-file is doubled. Trading pieces helps black's as now he has a knight for just a single pawn. } 23. Ra6 Nb5 24. d6 Bxb2 {Snatching a pawn and now white is a full piece down. Needed this pawn to go if I ever wanted the bishop on c3. The d-pawn will not promote anytime soon. } 25. d7 Bd4 {Thought about bringing the bishop to a3 then b4 but this seemed to round-about and on d4 it helps close the file to White's e1 rook. Even though this invites Nf3 bringing the knight back into the game, but trades will help Black and it will give me a chance to re-position my knight. } 26. Nf3 Rfd8 {Looking to eliminate this pawn before it becomes too much of a threat. } 27. Re7 {A weak square for a rook...} Nc7 {Attacks the a6 rook and eying e6. } 28. Rd6 Ne6 {! With the much needed knight maneuver everything is protected and the e7 rook is trapped!  } 29. Nxd4 cxd4 {Another trade which just helps Black. The f-pawn can't kick the knight in time to save the rook. } 30. Kg2 Kf8 31. Rdxe6 {Accepting the inevitable and sacrificing the exchange, although in reality White's able to resign here. } fxe6 32. Rxh7 {The d-pawn will fall and Black will be able to promote shortly. } e5 {First the d-pawn needs to be protected from both the advancing king and a rook move to h4. } 33. Kf3 a5 {Now the rook will come to a7, and the d-pawn's doomed. } 34. Ke4 {White can't take on e5 of course, due to ...d3!} Ra7 35. Rh8+ Ke7 36. Rh7+ Kf6 {White's out of options now. } 37. h4 {Looking to win the g-pawn and try to roll on the king-side but too little too late. } Raxd7 38. Rh6 {Another weak square. White doesn't want to trade off his one remaining piece and hopes he can start something after 39. h5 but black has other ideas in mind. } Kg7 {! The rook is trapped again, only now White can't sac an exchange to free it. 0-1 }
