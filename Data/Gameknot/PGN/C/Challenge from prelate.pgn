[Opening "Sicilian (B24), closed"]

1. e4 {I consider this one of my best games, not because it contains any brilliant sacrifices, but rather because of the subtle moves that lead to an end-game plus, despite good play from my opponent.  I, of course, started with my favourite king's pawn!} c5 {The Sicilian is my friend's standard reply to 1.e4 so I had prepared accordingly...} 2. Nc3 {I opt for the closed Sicilian in order to steer the game into unfamiliar lines.} Nc6 3. g3 e6 4. Bg2 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. Nge2 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Be3 {Don't want a black knight on d4 just yet!} h6 9. Nf4 {The knight wants to provoke 9. ..e5 so he can occupy d5 - while at the same time threatening to go to h5 and trade off knights to bring the queen to h5.} e5 10. Nfd5 {Success! The knight is stabled.} Nxd5 11. Nxd5 {One horse is as good as another...} Be6 12. f4 {The pawn break which I had planned for a while in anticipation of Bxd5 - the idea (as will become clear) is to create an ugly passed pawn on d5 that black will have to blockade, as well as opening the f-file for my rooks.} Bxd5 13. exd5 {the knight must move...} Nd4 14. fxe5 {Not 14. Bxd4 because that gives black an advance pawn wedge and I want my bishop to keep ministering for a while yet!} dxe5 15. c3 {Begone foul beast!} Nb5 16. Qh5 {The Queen is hoping to dethrone the black king with various moves including Bxh6 and Be4.} f6 {My opponent wisely protects f7 but leaves a convenient sally port on g6.  I analysed the bishop sac on h6 here but decided her Royal Highness needed some more manoeuvrings first.} 17. Qg6 {Crude (and unlady-like) but the threat Bxh6 is now very real. The moves Be4 and Qh7+ are also looming which will storm the castle and give mate. } Qe8 {Cat fight! The only way to relieve the pressure is to let the wives have a scrap } 18. Be4 Qxg6 19. Bxg6 {I have the bishop pair, now I have to prove their worth. Ideas based on the long g1-h7 and hi-b7 diagonals begin marinading. } b6 20. c4 Nd6 {The knight blockades well, yet is hampered by the pawn on d3 from leaping into my camp and causing mayhem - who says doubled pawns are bad?!} 21. a4 {My gun-sights are fixed on a7. I plan 22. a5 and if 22...b6xa5 then Bxc5 and Rxa5. 22...b5 falls to bxc5 as well.} f5 {Hoping to harass the white bishop and start a pawn storm on the king-side.} 22. a5 Bd8 {Black defends but weakens his back rank, as we shall see.} 23. b3 {A protecting move (to take the burden off d3) and a waiting move. I wait for the black rook to move to f6, further weakening the back rank and allowing the bishop to retreat to a happier hunting ground on the h1-h7 diagonal. } Rf6 24. Bh5 g5 {Here comes the pawn storm! However, the wind is taken out of the juggernaut's sails completely by white's next move.} 25. b4 {I allow myself a !! here. The weakness of black's back rank is his undoing. 25...c5xb4? 26.a5xb6 and the pawn cannot be taken by either the pawn on a7 nor the d8 bishop due to the pin on the rook at a8! 25...b6xa5 26.b4xc5 and a deadly centralised pawn mass emerges that black cannot stop. Blacks only hope is to try and counter attack on the king-side.} f4 26. gxf4 gxf4 27. Bf2 {The evil bishop stays on his powerful diagonal.} Rf5 28. Bf3 {The pressure against the a8 square is ready to blow.} e4 29. Bxe4 {Better than 29. d4xe4 because then the black knight enters white's position with 29...Rg5+ and Nxc4.} Rg5+ 30. Kh1 Bf6 {The beginning of a desperate attempt to relieve the pressure from the f2 bishop.} 31. Ra2 Bd4 32. axb6 {The poor rook at a8 isn't having a good day!} Bxf2 33. Rfxf2 {The position is hopeless for black as the white pawns will grind up the board relentlessly. e.g. 33...c5xb4 34.Rxa7 Rb8 35.c5 Nc8 36.Rc7. Black cannot retreat his rook to help on the back rank because his king is in the way!  }
