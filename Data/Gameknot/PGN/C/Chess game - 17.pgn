[Opening "Queen's pawn (A46), Yusupov-Rubinstein system"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 {I play the Colle system. Although after this game I have decided to give it up. The Colle is perfectly fine, but not ambitious and allows black to equalize to easily.} e6 3. e3 c5 4. Nbd2 d5 5. c3 Nc6 6. Bd3 {In situations like this some players have tried ...c4. It is generally ineffective. White has no trouble dislodging the pawn wedge with a3 and b4. } Bd6 7. O-O e5 {A little premature, but definitely playable, the response from white is essentially forced.} 8. dxe5 Nxe5 9. Nxe5 Bxe5 10. Nf3 Bc7 {A critical moment. Typically in the Colle I do not worry about the ...Bg4 pin because I have a knight on d2. That is not the case here. Also black has ideas of Qd6 and exchanging on f3. I neglected the strength of this idea and pressed on with my own development. Playing this position again I would play 11.h3.} 11. b3 O-O 12. Bb2 Bg4 13. c4 {Black could play Qd6 immediately, but plays slowly. After the game the player with the black pieces thought 13 ... Qd6 14.Be5 Qd7 costs black a tempo, but he failed to realize black can play 14... Qxe5.} Re8 14. cxd5 {I felt good about this move. 14... Qxd5 is impossible due to 15. Bxf6. 14... Nxd5 could be met with 15 e4 and possibly later e5.} Qd6 {The problem is that this move is strong. As white I have two options. 15. h3 or 15 Re1.} 15. Re1 {I calculated 15... Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Qxh7+ 17. Kf1. as being okay for white (the engine viewed it as equal). The position is easy to play because there is a straightforward idea to attack, Ke2 and Rh1. My opponent agreed with this analysis and instead played...} Ba5 {It turns out my rook doesn't have many squares. I considered Bb5 for far too long, but thought the ensuing complications could be no better for white.} 16. Rf1 Ne4 {This move is scary. Nc3 and Nd2 are ideas. Even Bd2 can be a threat. At this point I accepted that I would drop an exchange at some point.   The interesting thing is that after a Knight move I have Bxh7+ and can win a pawn. (My opponent missed this idea, although he may have let me even if he had seen it).  I decided to play a waiting move and see if he would let me play Bxh7+, but wanted the move to be productive, so I played,} 17. Rc1 Nd2 18. Bxh7+ Kh8 {Despite being up two pawns, I have issues. I need to spend a tempo to bring my bishop back. My rook is in danger, and I have to be wary of checkmate ideas on h2.   I went into a deep think regarding 19. Ng5 (which my engine actually claims is the best move). Over the board I calculated: 19. Ng5 Bxd1 20.Nxf7+ Kxh7 21.Nxd6 Nxf1 22.Nxe8 Rxe8 23.Kxf1  which leaves me with three pawns for a bishop (two connected passers). While I thought this was probably okay, I didn't trust myself over the board and was worried I would miss a tactic or line. So instead I played it safe.  The problem is I played it safe in a bad way, moving my bishop to c2 rather than b1. Oh well!} 19. Bc2 {Here is the critical moment. My opponent missed Nxf3 gxf3 Bc7 which just wins on the spot. I actually saw this after I played Bc2 and realized why Ng5 was the line I had to go for. Sometimes you get lucky and your opponents miss tactics!} Bxf3 20. gxf3 Nxf1 {I didn't think this was a great move, and was relieved when I saw it. At this point I thought I could maybe win even.  (Note my opponent is threatening checkmate on h2 in a sneaky way!)} 21. Qxf1 Qh6 {A good move. Black needs to shore up his defenses before white plays Rh1.} 22. Qc4 {I also considered Qb5 with a three-way attack. I think b5 was the better move. My initial idea was that on c4 my queen was better able to shift to e4, f4, or g4 if possible.} Bc7 23. f4 {Really the only good way to stop the threat on h2. Now my ideas regarding the fourth rank are garbage.} Bd6 {And black has blockaded the passed pawn. White really needs to seize initiative while blacks rooks are still clumsy.} 24. Kh1 {After this move I had 2:46 on my clock (with a five second delay).} Be7 {It took me a minute to understand this. Black wants to play Bf6, trade down, and get to an endgame with a rook versus bishop, hoping to overcome the two pawn deficit.   I actually liked my chances here, thinking he had no good way to stop the d pawn, so my main goal was to trade queens. Enjoy the fancy queen movement to come!} 25. Qb5 Bf6 26. Bxf6 Qxf6 {Qxb7 may be tempting, but Qb2 is deadly.} 27. Qd7 {Now Qb2 can be met with Qh3+, Qh7+, and Rg1 or something. I didn't calculate too much due to time pressure, but was certain I was not losing a piece.} Rad8 28. Qh3+ Qh6 29. Qxh6+ gxh6 30. e4 {Despite being in time pressure, the position is straightforward to play for white, and all I needed to do was find natural moves for the next bit. (I obviously didn't play perfectly, but I'm going to give fewer comments until the next major event).} f5 31. f3 b6 32. Kg2 Reg8+ 33. Kf2 Rg7 34. Rg1 {I can't allow both rooks to get on the g file.} Rxg1 35. Kxg1 fxe4 36. fxe4 {A curious mistake. I guess there is a chance I could have won it anyway after pushing e5 and playing Bxf5, but this was a gift to my pawn structure.} Kg7 37. Kf2 Kf7 38. Bd3 {I have to prevent black from getting counterplay by pushing queenside pawns, then it should be simple to dominate with the d, e, and f pawns.} Ke7 39. a4 Rd6 40. Bb5 {With the idea of Bc6.} Rf6 41. Kf3 Rg6 42. e5 Rg1 {And black has invaded. This was essentially unstoppable, but I may need to put it in the computer to see if I could have prevented this.} 43. d6+ Ke6 44. Ke2 {Prevents the rook getting behind the passed pawn. The price I pay is my h pawn.} Rg2+ 45. Ke3 Rxh2 46. d7 Ke7 47. f5 Rh3+ 48. Kf4 Rh4+ 49. Kg3 Rd4 50. f6+ Kf7 51. Bc4+ Kg6 52. Be6 {To support pawns on f7 and d7.  At this point I realized I royally had messed up this endgame and allowed him to blockade my pawns.} a6 53. f7 Kg7 54. Kf3 b5 55. axb5 axb5 56. Ke3 {Here black had to play b4. White can't make any progress, and eventually either the h or c pawns will advance. Black is actually better.  One idea for white is to play d8=Q to induce Rxd8. This allows the king to step up with Ke4. I put this in the computer and the idea doesn't work.} h5 {Instead black blundered. White's winning move is beautiful.} 57. b4 {Black doesn't have a move to save the position. At this point I have 11 seconds on my clock. My opponent played a couple more moves but the game is over.} Rxd7 58. Bxd7 cxb4 59. e6 Kf6 60. Kd3 h4 61. Bc6 {And black resigned.  I felt very luck to win this game.}
