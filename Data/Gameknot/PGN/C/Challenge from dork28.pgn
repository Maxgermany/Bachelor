1. d4 {How's my Dutch?  When I first started learning openings, my response to d4 as Black was the Dutch. My reasoning was it's superficial similarity to the King's Gambit, which I was playing as White at the time.  I dropped it in favour of the King's Indian Defence, as the Indian is more popular. Perhaps mistakenly, I assumed if finer chess brains than me had made the King's Indian popular, it must really be better.  } f5 {Recently, I've decided to broaden my opening repertoire and as I used to play it, I'm looking again at the Dutch. Here's a game where I played it for the first time in years.  I'd welcome comments/ criticism on my play.} 2. f4 {Not too popular reply from White here, as far as I can tell. Seems to counter the threat(?) of a later f4 from Black.  Allows Black to keep control of the e4 square. I guess this should be pretty comfortable for a player familiar with the Dutch?} Nf6 {Safe from Bg5 from White, Black's knight can happily make a home on f6.} 3. e3 {White makes a play for the dark squares, this formation protects the control White has over c5, e5 and g5.  The white squares d5, e4 and g4 are controlled by black.  e3 looks as though it has the potential to become weak as the game goes on.} e6 4. a3 {Seems a little early for this. White seems think a Bb4+ from Black is irritating enough to prevent.} b6 5. Nf3 Bb7 {White has strengthened its claim on the dark squares.  Black is master of the light squares.} 6. c4 {White makes a bid for b5 and d5, challenging black's light squared dominance.} Be7 {Preparing to castle. Black's rook may be able to control the f-file from f8, if the f pawn can usefully be exchanged away.} 7. h4 {Hmm. White continues to put pressure on the central dark squares. But White's pawn structure looks wild.   Castling kingside now looks dangerous for white and the queenside does not look any more attractive.  So many pawn moves by white and its pieces are underdeveloped. Black is edging ahead.} O-O {As in King's Gambit positions for white, here castling Kingside looks weakened by f-pawn having been moved so early.  As with the King's Gambit, too, the hope is the attacking chances created are sufficient that the weakened defences just do not matter.} 8. Bd3 d6 9. Qb3 {Hmm. This looks questionable. I'm not sure what White has really gained with this move.} d5 {First blood} 10. cxd5 Bxd5 {White is forced to protect its Queen.} 11. Bc4 Bxc4 12. Qxc4 {With Black's pawns occupying the light squares, White's light-squared bishop would have enjoyed better movement.  A sensible exchange for Black?} Nd5 {Prevents Qxe6+. Threatens e4. } 13. Ng5 {Nxc6 threatened.} Qd6 14. g3 {White hopes to storm the centre with its pawns?  Behold the poor isolated King!} h6 {Kick!} 15. Nf3 {Undefended Knight, as white's pawns have all gone deep. The white diagonal looks weak for White.  Could Black exploit this?} Nd7 {There is a hole in White's defence on g4 that is calling to be inhabited by a Knight. The Knight on d5 shouldn't move as it blocks Qxe6+.  The Knight on b8 can make it by Nd2, Nf6, Ng4.  It's thanks to Jeremy Silman and his 'Reassess your Chess' that I can consider such things. :)} 16. Rg1 {An assault on g7 planned by White?} Nd7f6 17. b4 {White dominates the dark squares on the fifth rank.} Ng4 {Black's Knight finds the hole. This also seems to block White's plans against g7.} 18. Ne5 {Exchange of Knights offered.} Ngxe3 {Ngxe3. Weakens white's central pawns.   Bxe3 and White would simply lose the Bishop to the Knight on d5.} 19. Qd3 {Chase away the Knight.} Ng4 {Back in the hole. Exchange offered to the Knight on e5.} 20. Nxg4 fxg4 {Exchange taken by White.  Black has got the better of the exchanges. } 21. Bb2 Bf6 22. Qe2 Rad8 23. Qxg4 {Black loses a pawn. And things are equal?  Black should be better from this position in my opinion.} Ne3 {Threatens the Queen - and the King/rook fork on c2.} 24. Qg6 Nc2+ {Outright blunder from black. Too hasty to move.   Forcing the King to move and taking the rook would likely have been game winning for Black. White was on top of this threat.} 25. Qxc2 {Om nom nom, says the Queen.} Bxd4 {Black continues to open the centre. White is now a little ahead on material but White's King is still looking exposed.  } 26. Rg2 {Prevents Bxg1 without exchanging Bishops.} e5 {Hmm.} 27. Nc3 {Prevents Bishop exchange and allows Queenside castle. } exf4 28. O-O-O f3 29. Rgd2 {A fight for the d-file.  Black's passed pawn can pose problems for White though.} Be3 {Pinned!} 30. Kb1 {Loosens the pin but the exchange of a Bishop for a Rook will put Black back ahead.  This looks dangerous for White.} Bxd2 31. Rxd2 Qxg3 {Protects the passed pawn and wins a pawn.} 32. Ne4 Qe1+ 33. Ka2 Rxd2 34. Nxd2 f2 {White must prevent the pawn from promoting.} 35. Qc4+ Rf7 {I thought about this for a long time. It superficially looks like a blunder (and is, I think).  I did not like the look of the dark squared diagonal towards g7, controlled by White's Bishop. I preferred this to placing the King on h7 or h8.} 36. Nf1 Qd1 37. Be5 Qh5 38. Bxc7 Kh7 {Black gets its Queen back to protect the Rook on f7 so the King can move but g7 is defended.} 39. Bg3 {The precious pawn could be lost.} Rf3 {Threatens the Bishop. Black wants compensation for the pawn.} 40. Qd4 {Adds pressure to f2... BUT leaves the light squared diagonal towards White's King on a2 exposed.} Qf7+ {.} 41. Kb1 Qb3+ {.} 42. Qb2 Qd1+ {.} 43. Qc1 {Forced because Qxf1 looks bad for White.} Rb3+ {White resigned, the loss of the Queen just seemed too much.}
