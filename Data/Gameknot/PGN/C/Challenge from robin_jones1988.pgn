[Opening "Bishop's opening (C23), Classical variation"]

1. e4 {A really good game between 2 equal players. Could have gone either way, and certainly I have learnt a lot from mistakes both of us made through the match. Comments welcome...} e5 {Having experimented with the Sicilian defense a few months ago I have returns to my prefered opening ...e5. Despite contrary advice I consider the best opening to be one that suits your style of play, or simply one that you are familiar with.} 2. Bc4 {As a rule I prefer this to a Ruy Lopez opening (from blacks perspective), but I have had a number of disasters against the Lopez, so am probably biased against it.} Bc5 {Other variations playable, but again I am most comfortable with this.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d3 Nc6 5. Nge2 {Clearly a pre-prepared move, I hadn't faced this before. I would normally expect Nf3, or Bg5 but as the game develops it becomes clear why white chose this.  Looking through variations now, Ng4 looks interesting. If 1) 6. d4 exd4 7. Na4, with a small advantage to black 2) 6. 0-0 Qh4 (possible since knight isn't on f3) 7. h3 (avoiding # on h2) Nxf2 looks pretty good for black, since black is going to have to give up the exchange} O-O 6. O-O {Castle early, castle often. Famous advice and adhered to here, although my castle is more a natural development of my position, white's castling is part of a greater scheme..} d6 {Still developing, freeing the bishop} 7. h3 h6 {In Irving Chernev's famous book, Logical Chess, he greatly criticizes weakening the structure in front of the king. I don't normally find any problems, at least against players my standard, so have continued to play h6.} 8. Kh1 {The final stages of whites development are in action, and the reason for putting the knight on e2 clear. Kh1 unpins the f-pawn allowing him to make the push f4 undermining my center. } Bd7 9. f4 {As predicted, I am unwise to take the pawn, as the variation 9...exf4 10. d4 Bb6 11. Bxf4 leaves white in a very strong position covering 5 ranks against my 3.  If any of my former students are reading this, they should note that in under 10 moves we have both completed development and are ready to start the middlegame, it is essential to prepare your forces in the beginning as rushing into attack early almost never pays off} Na5 {Feeling concerned about the potencial problems on the kingside, I move to free up my queenside. This move will remove the powerfully placed bishop, allowing me to gain some control in the centre, and frees my c-pawn to help advances in the centre and queenside} 10. Bb3 {White knows he will be doubling pawns, and chooses to do so on the b-file rather than the c-file. Clearly allowing me to capture on the c4 square leaves his center very weak} Nxb3 11. axb3 Re8 {Supports the e-pawn if I manufacture a chance to push the d-pawn forward} 12. f5 {Chooses to lock up the center. This move leaves me in a tricky position, I know he will attack down the g/h files, as indicated by his choice of opening, but both of my bishops are now blocked from helping to defend. My personal experience has shown that under an attack like this the best way to defend is attack} c6 {Planning to push the d-pawn and hopefully break his chain of pawns} 13. g4 d5 {Unable to prevent anything happening kingside, I drive forward through the middle hoping to gain counterplay against the attack.} 14. g5 hxg5 15. Bxg5 {White now has a very dangerous open g-file pointing straight at my king. From my point of view many things can go wrong, and white has a clear attack, bringing the h-pawn forwards with the help of his well placed f4 pawn. From black's side the plan is to open the center as whites king is very exposed.} d4 {This seems counterproductive as I want to open the center, but I can't force the position open at the minute, taking the e-pawn only results in strengthening the line as I won't be able to challenge it with pawns. I also thought the pin on the knight prevented me from protecting the d-pawn sufficiently.} 16. Nb1 Be7 {Repositioning the bishop, at the time this was played as a defensive move, and just waiting for white to commit to an attack.} 17. Ng3 {Looking at this position it's understandable for white to make the move, but it turns out to be completely wrong...} Nxe4 {If now Bxe7 then Nxg3  loses the bishop at least after Kg1 (Kg2 sets up fork after Nxf1, and Kh2 leaves check after Nxf1 so loses the exchange)} 18. Nxe4 {The only move in the position. This puts whites knight on a very powerful outpost close to my king} Bxg5 19. Qg4 {Interestingly after such an aggressive start from white I had feared a continuation such as f6. However this slightly quieter move leads to a forceful attack supporting the h6 pawn forwards.} Bh6 {Better than f6, as after 20. Nxg5 fxg5 21. Rg1 the pawn will fall, and white's attack is difficult to defend.} 20. Nbd2 {Looking from white's point of view I realise I had missed the threat Nd6, winning back the pawn. It's possible white saw this but chose to continue the attack, which ended up more valuable than reclaiming the pawn he had lost.} Bxd2 {Unwilling to let the knight join the attack I chose to remove it. It also gives me a tempo to try and set up some sort of counterattack down the center.} 21. Nxd2 c5 {About the best I could come up with, I now have lines open and aiming at the exposed white king. Despite this I do feel that my pawn advantage is a very slim one, if at all.} 22. Ne4 {Bringing the knight back to support the attack, and with a threat to capture the c5 pawn. This is easily blocked though.} Bc6 {Pins the knight to the king, and will remove it next move. At this point I reasoned that fewer pieces on the board will mean a reduced attack.} 23. Kh2 {In my view a slow move, but then again I knew I would take the knight regardless of the move played (within reason)} Bxe4 24. dxe4 f6 {Played to allow my major pieces to defend the vulnerable g7 square against the threat of Rg1. However this wasn't the only threat white has in the position} 25. h4 {Finally white proceeds as I had predicted back all those moves ago. The pawn on f6 now hinders my queen from moving in front of the king, so I have no real defense to this.} Re7 {This move would have to be played at some point, so might as well do it now. However the inevitable h5 comes next and a slow but unstopable threat is on the horizon. My only choice, as said many times before, is to attack} 26. h5 d3 {Penetrating into whites terratory, this also aims to clear the way for the manouever Q-d2-h6 if I have enough time. Though time is something that is decidedly against me} 27. Rad1 {Naturally white has no incentive to play risky chess. His attack is well poised and I am rather floundering despite my material advantage} Qd4 {Again penetrating into whites territory, praying that I can continue to distract him long enough to muster defense around the king} 28. Rxd3 {A obvious but good move. Rooks are very strong when lined up on the same file. White now has the option to do this either on the g-file, building pressure on the g7 pawn, or he can move to control the open d-file} Qxb2 29. Rfd1 {White creates a direct mating threat, after Rd8 and Qg6. This is pretty unstopable, aside from sacrificing the queen on d2. All white needs to do is set up a second threat with the h-pawn and I will be overrun.} Rae8 {Last gasp defence. An immediate 30. Rd8 will likely fizzle out into a draw after 30...Qxc2  31. R1d2 Qxb3 32. Rxe8 Rxe8 33. Rd7 Qc2 , ending in repetition or perhaps a queen / rook endgame.} 30. h6 {This should be the final nail in the coffin, the threat of Rd8 is now very effective as my e7 rook is pinned to the g7 pawn to protect against checkmate in 1.} Kh8 {With the impending Rd8 I really want to move to f8, so the king can protect the e8 rook (since the e7 rook can't). But the threat of h7! makes that impossible. No other feasible move to make, so just sit back and decide when to hit resign} 31. Rd3d7 {Having played a near flawless attack, white finally slips up just when he had me where he wanted me. Rd8 is crushing, leading to a queen sacrifice as the only way to prevent checkmate.} Rxd7 {Forced} 32. Rxd7 Qxc2+ {The only move, I can now push whites king around waiting for him to block with his queen forcing a drawn endgame, or force a draw through repetition. Really a lifeline I didn't deserve having been outplayed all match, but chances like this don't come every day and I had to stay alert to make sure I don't slip up and gift my opponent a win in a drawn position} 33. Kh3 Qc3+ 34. Kg2 {Note that 34. Kh4 leads to 34...Qe1 and 35...Qh1 forcing a queen exchange in 1-3 moves (depending on the variation). After which I can take the h6 pawn giving me a pawn advantage 5-3 in the endgame (after Rxb7), and thus potencial winning chances.} Qc2+ {Plan seems to be working, I felt sure this match is heading for a draw by repetition. This is the best result for white, despite having been in charge for most of the match.} 35. Kf1 {Another critical blunder...} Qc1+ 36. Ke2 Qxh6 {Winning the h6 pawn and defends against Qxg7#. The middlegame is now over, and a queen   rook endgame is in progress. As in any major piece endgame piece activity is far more important than material advantage. A well placed rook vs Inactive rook can be an advantage of up to 2 pawns, so this finale should be anything but easy to convert} 37. Rxb7 {Grabbing the free pawn quite correctly, but even a quick glance at the position shows that for the first time in the match black has gained a winning position. An advantage of 5 pawns to 3. Here it is tempting to move Ra8 defending the a-pawn, but this takes my rook right out of the game...} Rd8 {Rd8 however gives me a well placed rook in a dangerous position holding the open file, worth more to me than the isolated pawn on a7. Also since the pawn is not a passed pawn, (the b3 pawn can take it) my plan can't be to just push the pawns to the end of the board, supported by rook and queen} 38. Rxa7 {Continuing to grab pawns, but still with a material deficit. His rook is miles away from the action, while I now have a great opportunity to close a box around the white king using my well placed rook and queen.} Rd2+ {The rook check is preferable to a queen check, as my rook is brought up the board to smother the king. A queen check would lead to the same result, but I would still need to bring the rook to this quarter of the board to seal checkmate, so further queen checks would be needed to allow the rook to arrive on the scene} 39. Kf3 {1 of 3 moves available 1) Kf3, the game line 2) Kf1, leading to Qh1 and Qf3 and checkmate to follow 3) Ke2, leading to Qe3 and checkmate to follow So in all probably the best move, but failing an awful blunder, white is lost} Qh1+ {Closing the box, Only 2 options 1) Kg3, the gameline 2) Ke3 leading to Qe1 and Qf2#} 40. Kg3 {Only way to avoid checkmate, but...} Rg2+ {! secures my opponents resignation, my queen and rook will either force checkmate in a few, or I can take his queen and ease to victory Q vs R. Either way white saves himself some time and resigns. In all a good match, both players showed some really good positional play, in the face of losing material we kept to our guns and showed material isn't everything. Any comments on the game are welcomed, and I understand Robin is doing his own annotation of the game, so look out for that.}
