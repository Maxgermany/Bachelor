1. e4 c5 {Just prior to this, I had lost to the same opponent trying (as an experiment) to defend the Ruy Lopez. Here I reverted to my normal Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Bd7 {I also often play ...Nd7 here, but last time  I played it it led to a very closed position. My idea when playing this variation is to try to transpose to a Dragon with light-squared bishops off.} 4. Bxd7+ Nxd7 5. d4 {White transposes immediately to an Open Sicilian, in which however the exchange of light-squared bishops is considered to favour black, especially in the Dragon. Accordingly, I head for the Dragon.} cxd4 6. Nxd4 Ngf6 7. Nc3 g6 {Roar!} 8. O-O {White goes for a classical dragon rather than the Yugoslav.} Bg7 9. h3 {Presumably feeling the absence of a bishop on e2.} O-O 10. Nb3 Rc8 11. Be3 a6 {A little precaution to get out of the way of the bishop, but ...a6 is thematic anyway. In some games I have got into trouble through the weakness of b6, but as it happens my "misplaced" knight on d7 has that nicely covered.} 12. a4 {I had hoped to provoke this response. It is often good to constrain black in this way, but in this case allows me to take the initiative.} Rxc3 {A thematic exchange sacrifice, and the decisive point of the game. In this case black recovers all his material immediately, but I would still have played it anyway.} 13. bxc3 Nxe4 14. Nd4 Nxc3 15. Qd3 {I expected Qd2 here, aiming for Bh6.} Qc7 16. Rae1 {Presumably aiming at e7, but white's rooks are now very cramped.} Ne5 {Now black's knights are about to prove themselves a match for white's rooks.} 17. Qd2 Nxa4 18. Bh6 {Now Bh6 is too late, and White will get nothing from the following exchanges.} Nc4 19. Qc1 Bxd4 20. Bxf8 Kxf8 21. Qh6+ Kg8 22. Re4 Bf6 {Overprotecting e7 and denying h5 to white's major pieces.} 23. h4 {In search of counterplay in the form of a Yugoslav-style pawn storm.} Nc3 {Mining several dark squares the moment white's rook leaves the e-file.} 24. Ree1 Na3 {The c-pawn cannot be defended except by withdrawing the queen.} 25. Re3 {Heading for h3, at the cost however of several tempi by now.} Nxc2 26. Rh3 Qc5 {Improving the position of the queen.} 27. g4 {Weakening the king's position.} Qd4 {The g-pawn cannot be defended, while g5?? would lose the queen to Bg7.} 28. Rxc3 {Hoping to pressurize black down the c-file with the threat of a back-rank mate...} Qxc3 {...but white realized that black can defend against it, and his position is hopeless in the face of black's armada of passed pawns. 0-1.}
