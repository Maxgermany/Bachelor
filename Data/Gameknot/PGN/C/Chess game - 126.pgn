1. e4 e5 {The only opening I really know.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {A lot of my games have this position.} 3. d4 Bd6 {I don't like this move, it blocks in my LSB. I probably should have moved my d pawn one square forward and maybe fianchettoed my DSB. Or just taken the pawn} 4. d5 {Now I have to move my knight. Hmm where should I put him?} Nb4 {Okay I really don't like this. I think I should have put him on D4 maybe?} 5. Bg5 Nf6 6. a3 {...And now I have to move my knight to the rim which is grim.} Na6 7. Bxa6 bxa6 8. Nc3 Bb7 9. O-O O-O 10. Qe2 a5 {I think this was a wasted move.} 11. Qb5 h6 {I don't like this move. I think I probably should have moved my queen to b8 maybe.} 12. Qxb7 hxg5 {Trade, but now my kingside is blown open.} 13. Nxg5 {...and I lose a pawn} Rb8 {Skewering the queen and the b pawn} 14. Qxa7 Ra8 {...and I don't even take the pawn.} 15. Qe3 Ng4 16. Nxf7 {? It blows away some more of my cover but I don't think it's worth a knight.} Rxf7 17. Qg3 Qg5 18. h4 Qf4 19. Qxf4 Rxf4 {I like the rook capture more than the pawn.} 20. f3 Bc5+ 21. Kh1 Ne3 22. Rf2 Rxh4+ {Now I'm ahead by a pawn and manage to keep the advantage for the rest of the game.} 23. Kg1 Nxc2 {I like this move. I take a pawn and pin the rook to the king at the same time.} 24. Raf1 Bxf2+ {of course I take the rook} 25. Kxf2 {Getting his king centralized for the endgame. } Rb8 {Attacking another pawn.} 26. g3 Rh2+ 27. Kg1 {Okay why did he do that? I understand that he wants to attack my rook but I think it would have been better to centralize his king some more. On the other hand think way I can't take the pawn yet} Ne3 28. Re1 Rg2+ 29. Kh1 Nc2 30. Rd1 Ne3 31. Re1 Nc2 32. Rc1 Rd2 33. Kg1 Rxb2 34. Nb1 c6 {Why didn't I notice he was attacking the rook?!} 35. Nxd2 {And now I completely threw away my material lead.} cxd5 36. Rb1 {Okay he should have taken back the pawn first.} Rxb1+ {Why certainly I'll trade, after all I am ahead by a pawn.} 37. Nxb1 d4 38. Nd2 d3 {I really should have taken his pawn.} 39. Nc4 {And now he defended it.} a4 40. Nd2 {...only to move it back. I would probably taken on e5} Kf7 41. Kf2 {We both centralize our kings} Nxa3 {Finally I take his pawn} 42. Ke3 Nb5 43. Kxd3 {...And he takes my pawn. I now try to promote my passed pawn, but with my kins so far away I fail.} a3 44. Nb3 a2 45. Na1 Na3 46. Kc3 {I think it was around this time that I offered a draw. He declined.} g5 47. Kb3 {And now I lose my passed pawn making the game equal again.} Nb5 48. Kxa2 Kf6 {I advance my king} 49. g4 Ke6 50. Nc2 Nd4 {Hoping for a knight trade after which my king could eat the white pawns as he is so much closer that his pale counterpart.} 51. Ne3 {Nope, no such luck} d6 52. Nf5 {Here I offer another draw. He declines again. } Nxf3 {I really should have taken his knight, but the pawn was too tempting.} 53. Ng7+ {Now follows some aimless knightplay until finally a draw by repetition.} Kd7 54. Nf5 Ke6 55. Ng7+ Kf6 56. Ne8+ Ke6 57. Ng7+ Kf6 58. Ne8+ Ke6 59. Ng7+ Kf6 {And finally a draw! My question is, could either side have done better than a draw?}
