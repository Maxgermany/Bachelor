1. e4 {This is another game I had with the lovely MissLoly.} c5 {I played e5 in our previous game, so I do somethng different.} 2. Bc4 {A good move, developing a piece to a good square and striking at f7.} e6 {So I blunt the power of that bishop.} 3. Nf3 {Another good move, developing a piece.} a6 {So I "threaten" a queen side pawn expansion, but she can just ignore it, like she did.} 4. O-O {She continues to develop.} b5 {So I attack.} 5. Be2 {Bishop drops back.} Bb7 {I hit the e pawn.} 6. Nc3 {This protects the pawn, but d3 was a much better way of protecting it, as I can just drive the knight away.} b4 {So I attack the knight.} 7. Na4 {She moves it.} Bxe4 {And i take, to go a clear pawn up.} 8. Nxc5 {This is another bad mistake, just giving up a knight.} Bxc5 {So I just take.} 9. d3 {She now attacks the bishop.} Bd5 {So I drop back.} 10. d4 {And now she attacks the other bishop.} Ba7 {And that one drops back.} 11. c4 {She continues with her policy of attacking my bishops.} bxc3 e.p. {Luckily I can take that pawn en passant. } 12. bxc3 {She takes back.} Qc7 {I prevent her from continuing her plan with c3-c4. Now, because of this queen move, if she does play c3-c4 then I can just take that pawn with my bishop, and if the then plays Qc2 pinning my bishop I can protect it with d7-d5. I am also attacking c3.} 13. Ne5 {This is another mistake, c3 needed protecting.} d6 {So I drive the knight back first.} 14. Nd3 {It retreats.} Qxc3 {I take, attacking d4 and Ra1.} 15. Bd2 {This saves the rook, but not the pawn.} Qxd4 16. Be3 {She attacks the queen.} Qf6 {Queen retreats.} 17. Qc1 {Post Match Computer Analysis (PMGA) gives 17. Nb4 as better, but this move is interesting, with potential attacks along the c file.} e5 {PGMA gives this as a mistake. I will explain why I played it. I want to play Qg6 to threaten mate on g2. But if I play it immediately, she can play Nf4, so e5 was to stop Nf4.} 18. Bg5 {She attacks my queen. I have to be very careful here! Qg6?? is met by Qc8 mate!} Qf5 {The queen on this square covers c8.} 19. a4 {This move doesn't achieve much.} Nc6 {I want to play Qe4, but if I play it, she still has Qc8 mate - so I block that mate first.} 20. g4 {A dreadful move, opening up he own king side position.} Qe4 {Mate on g2 or h1 can't be prevented.} 21. Qa3 {As good as anything.} Qg2# {And it is all over. Many thanks for reading this dear reader. Please leave a comment or two and rate this annotation on the star system, many thanks!}
