[Opening "QGD (D07), Chigorin defence"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 {This is the starting position of the Tchigorin Defence. Revived lastly by the top GM Alexander Morozevich. Much less explored than the Slav 2...c6, Queen's Gambit Accepted 2...dxc4 or Orthodox Systems beginning with 2...e6. I very much like the development of the Nc6 here as it is quite justified by the c2-c4 pawn advance wich make possible immediate pressure on Pawn d4. One drawback of this method is the obligatory investment of Black's pair of Bishops to maintain his opening goals, but Knights are pleasant beasts also in combat.  } 3. cxd5 Qxd5 {For the moment, the Queen is not to be dislodged from d5 as 3.Nc3 loses the d Pawn.  } 4. e3 e5 {Black should not fear to make such clear pawn pushes in the Tchigorin Defence, his play must stay active, clear-cut and strategical if he wants to make the most of his journey.} 5. Nc3 Bb4 {The pin is almost obligatory, compensation for the future exchange on c3 lies also in quick development. } 6. Bd2 Bxc3 7. Bxc3 Nge7 {Taking on d4 to saddle White with an Isolani was an illusion, because if 7..exd4 instead White plays the subtle 8.Ne2 with an interesting battle ahead. But wait... this is the move advised by theory !  What is this 7...Nge7 for ? First, 7...Nge7 is loosing a pawn but accelerates development. Second, should Black recover the e5 pawn, White in the meantime could have made significant positional progresses to take the advantage. In short this is on these kind of imbalance that new theoritical paths are growing until the initial question is more or less solved, or not...} 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Qxd5 Nxd5 {Ok here we are : Black is threatening to take on c3 and then regaining his pawn on e5 with good prospects.} 10. Bb5 {A most natural move. 10.Nf3 is also to be analyzed. } Ke7 {Excellent or crazy move, I do not know, on the one hand trivialy escaping the pin and connecting Rooks, on the other hand apparently sacrificing another pawn.} 11. Bxc6 Nxc3 12. Bxb7 Rab8 13. bxc3 Rxb7 14. Nf3 Bxa2 {In fact, the pawn invested by 10...Ke7 is immediately regained due to the Rb1  trick that threatens the h1 Rook, but not any kind of pawn, the only one that could oppose to the a file runner : a7. } 15. Nd4 Ra8 {Each time in the ending that you can put a waiting Rook behind a passed pawn, do it immediately... it is almost every time the best move at hand, even if the computer analysis ater the game actually says "no". Now Black has two compensations for the lost pawn in the opening : a minor one, Bishop tends to coordinate better with Rooks, and a major one, a very dangerous passed a Pawn assisted by Rook and Bishop. Position assesment now, should be "unclear"} 16. O-O {White must seek rapid development and coordination for his pieces because Black is ready to push a5. Castling king-side is merely forced as 16.Ke2 Rb2  is not good.} Rb2 {Taking space inside White's camp and making difficult for White pieces to come into play. } 17. Nc6+ Ke8 18. f3 {Best choice, White will disentangle himself by playing Rf2. 18.f4 was not precise because of 18...a5 19.Rf2 Rb1  20.Rxb1 Bb1 21.Rf1 Be4 and White Bishop is magnificently posted.} a5 {Everything is in order. Now is the time to push the a pawn.} 19. Rf2 {The logical continuation of 18.f3 } Rb1+ 20. Rxb1 Bxb1 21. Rf1 {Perhaps not 21.Rb2 because this Rook will end on the a-file and the first Rank is preferable as on square a1 the Bishop will not  gain time because the Rook cannot  be attacked there.} Bd3 22. Ra1 {Not 22.Rd1 as it will simply loose time to place the Black Bishop to the superb c4 square.} a4 {Push again.} 23. Nb4 Bc4 24. Nc2 {Well played White manoeuvre,  the Knight is now posted between attack (d4) and defence (a3).} Kd7 {I had the feeling that Black could not increase the pressure by his pieces alone, so I activated my King.} 25. Kf2 Ke6 26. f4 {Securing e5 Pawn but at the cost of giving more freedom of action to Black Bishop and King. } c5 {Profiting from a Pawn move, to make another Pawn move that restricts White Knight jumping spots. It can be said also that c5 pawn could be equally dangerous to pawn a if the c3 pawn falls. } 27. Na3 Bd3 28. Rd1 c4 {This move looks potentially very static, but the point is that my Bishop here is blocking d and b file for the White Rook, which is not the case for the Black one, which has the b-file.} 29. Nb5 Ra5 {Alas, after 29...Rb1 the penetration of Black's Rook is not decisive and the a pawn is quite in danger. For the moment, supporting the pawn on the a-file is stronger.} 30. Nd4+ {White is also playing for a win. My opponent could have put me in front of quite a problem, if he had just returned the Knight by 30.Na3, I would have had the choice between a draw by move repetition (30.Na3 Ra8 31.Nb5 etc.), or trying to find a better alternative. As I said in the previous note, it is too early to seize the b-file. This is perhaps some kind of backfiring of Black's static 28th move. Anyway, a draw would have been a perfectly reasonable outcome, because my opponent has not made the slightest mistake and produced good moves.} Kd5 31. g3 Ra8 {Reason of this subtle move is quite obscure but I think valid. First, I cannot play 31...a3 immediately since 32.e4 ! and the pawn is untouchable : 32...Bxe4?? 33.Nb3  and the Rook on a5 is lost ; 32...Kxe4? 33.e6! with a dangerous passed pawn since 33...fxe6? 33. Re1  loses material. I needed a good waiting move, renewing the threat of the "a pawn" push : 31...Ra8 was perfect, because there the Rook stayed best away Knight forking tricks. } 32. Nf5 {White continue to play for a win, 32.Ra1 a3 33.Nb5 Rb8 and even if Black's Rook enter White's camp through the b-file, chances of drawing are quite good. } a3 {Now White's Rook will be trapped on a8 and the battle will be decided between White's Knight vs Black's Rook.} 33. Nxg7 a2 34. Ra1 Bb1 {Trapped it is.} 35. Ke2 Ra3 {If Black's Rook can pass behind the White pawns before they can prove dangerous the game will soon be over for White.The idea is accessing second Rank by the manoeuvre Ra3-b3-b2.} 36. Kd2 Rb3 37. Ne8 Rb2+ 38. Kc1 Rxh2 39. Nd6 {Technically I believe the game is won now, the fact that c3 pawns fall is just icing on the cake. } Rc2+ 40. Kd1 Rxc3 {White's pawn are helpless and c4 pawn is another threat.} 41. Ke2 Rb3 42. e4+ Kd4 43. e6 fxe6 44. Nxc4 {Or the c pawn queens...} Kxc4 45. Kf2 Kd4 46. e5 Ke4 {From now on the game continued until mate.} 47. Rxa2 Bxa2 48. f5 Kxf5 49. Kf1 Rb2 50. Ke1 Bb3 51. Kf1 Kg4 52. Ke1 Kf3 53. g4 h6 54. g5 hxg5 55. Kf1 Rb1# {Mate... The Black pawn sacrifices brought sufficient compensation for a dangerous Blackgame, as White played purposefully the opening, but it seems no more than that as White had opportunities of drawing the endgame around move 30. Nice, tense and strategical game...}
