1. e4 {This game I felt that white was just giving a way its pieces . I  am black  and   joannayen  is white.} e5 {king pawn opening } 2. Bb5 {attacking mode. I think white was trying  to check in the first couple of moves. .} c6 {blocking the bishop  of it could not move forward. I knew if b5 takes c6  , I could take c6 by b7 to c6 or  d7 to c6. } 3. Nf3 {building up her defense but  did not see that i could take her bishop.} cxb5 {took a free piece . I just knew white could win a free pawn by  f3 to e5.} 4. O-O {castle  king  side.} Nf6 {starting to build my defense.} 5. Nxe5 {takes free pawn  and getting super close to my king but I have could get a free piece  by moving  f6 to e4} Nxe4 {free piece} 6. Nc3 { knows that she  could get my knight on her next move.} Nf6 {knew what white was going to do but  I backed up  so I would not lose a piece.} 7. Nxb5 { free piece. On last move I felt it was more important to get my knight to a safe spot than save that pawn.} Nc6 {knights defense} 8. Qf3 {white is trying to get my knight} Ng8 {knight back to safe spot.} 9. Qg4 {moving up with  the queen.} Nh6 { now I have 2 ways to get  2 white pieces. } 10. d4 {gets black up for knight but does not realize i could take the pawn.} Nxg4 {free piece .  Bad move on white for not moving its queen.} 11. c4 { moves pawn up} Nxd4 {free piece. my knights are doing really good job.} 12. Bg5 {trying to get my king .   I realized that could check with my knight on my move by d4 to e2} Ne2+ {check} 13. Kh1 {moves to safe spot.} Qxg5 {time to get that bishop out the game.} 14. Nf3 {protecting the king. Saw a chance to get other check .} Nxf2+ {check} 15. Rxf2 {was willing to give up that piece because white is starting to look  really weak at this point.} Ng3+ {check.} 16. Kg1 {moves to safe spot.} Ne2+ {check . I do not think white would even think of taking my knight so I fell safe leaving it there.} 17. Kf1 {As I thought white did not take my knight so that means my knight could give white more problems.} Ng3+ {check} 18. Kg1 {moves to safe spot.} Ne2+ {wonders if white would realize  that if white keeps it up that we would not get any where in this game.} 19. Kh1 { same old stuff. } Bb4 {putting the heat on white.} 20. Ne5 {trying to get something started but did not realize that could take her knight with my queen.} Qxe5 {is it just me or is white just giving away pieces .} 21. Rxf7 { white did not realize I could take her rook  with my king.} Kxf7 {free piece. I just know I would get a win if white keeps on giving away pieces.} 22. Nd6+ {check . good try but not good enough.} Qxd6 {I am sure I am going  to win this game. 1 make sure white does get his pawn to my side so she can trade her pawns for other pieces  2 get ride of that rook. 3 check 4 checkmate.} 23. Re1 { protecting her king} Ng3+ {check  } 24. Kg1 {white is at the the end of her road} Bxe1 { got her rook . time to checkmate.} 25. c5 {walking in to a checkmate} Qxc5# {checkmate.}
