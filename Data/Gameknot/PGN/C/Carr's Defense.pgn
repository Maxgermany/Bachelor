1. e4 {Hi everyone, this was a really awful game against Master Freddy.  In this I made a couple of beginner errors which spoilt things big time.  I thought this game would be worth annotating though because of the unusual opening that Freddy played, i.e. he plays h6 in response to my e4.} h6 2. d4 a6 3. Bd3 Nc6 4. Nf3 Nb4 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3 - normal, routine development but allows exchange of N for B on d3.} Nxd3+ 6. Qxd3 d6 7. Bd2 e6 8. O-O {8. 0-0, still routine.} g5 {8. ......... g5 - the beginnings of a pawn storm I thought, but this was a red herring.} 9. Be3 Bg7 10. e5 {10. e5?? - or how many other question marks would you jury like to put on it.  It is a blunder with a capital B because silly me overlooked g4 which would undermine the defense of the pawn on e5.  Pay attention Joanne!} g4 11. Nd2 dxe5 12. dxe5 Qxd3 13. cxd3 Bxe5 14. Rac1 {14. Rac1 - after the plethora of exchanges in which the queens are off the board (look on the bright side - at least I may not get Freddied mid-game!).  Freddy said that the rook move was good which was some consolation.  However, this is as good as it gets.} Ne7 15. Nc4 Bg7 16. a4 Bd7 {16. ............. Bd7 - Freddy has cleared his back ranks and is ready to castle - he opts for queenside castling.} 17. b3 O-O-O 18. Ne2 {18. Ne2 - after Freddy chooses queenside castling I lay a little trap for him with this Sneaky Knight retreat.  Can you the jury see it?  I think Freddy could though because he played his bishop to c6.  This is the only time in the game that I actually threatened to do something.} Bc6 19. Rfd1 Rd7 20. Rd2 Rhd8 21. Rcd1 {21. Rcd1 - bolstering my isolani.} Ng6 22. Bc5 {22. Bc5 - trying to get good squares for my pieces.  Apart from the pawn minus white looks OK here - but I did say looks - they can be very deceptive as Freddy is about to demonstrate!} Nh4 23. Ne3 b6 24. Ba3 Bxg2 {24. ......... Bxg2!! - Freddy unleashes a stunning sacrifice which nets my rook and several pawns for two pieces.} 25. Nxg2 Nf3+ 26. Kh1 Nxd2 27. Rxd2 Rd7xd3 28. Rxd3 Rxd3 29. Ne3 {29. Ne3 - after that plethora of exchanges there is no way I can back up b3 so the b pawn now drops.} Rxb3 30. Bc1 Rb4 31. a5 {31. a5 - trying to at least re-arrange that black pawn cluster over on the queenside but to no avail.} b5 32. Kg2 Ra4 33. Kg3 {33. Kg3 - trying to win the g pawn but that doesn't work.} f5 34. Kg2 c5 35. h3 gxh3+ 36. Kxh3 Rxa5 37. Nf4 {37. Nf4 - the a pawn has duly dropped off - now just look at those black queenside passers.  I spent the last few moves trying to break up Freddy's kingside pawns and am now attacking his pawn on e6, but Freddy now follows basic endgame principles by centralising his king.} Kd7 38. Neg2 Ra1 39. Be3 c4 {39. ......... c4 - after Fou Lenoir sidestepps Freddy's rook, Freddy sends those queenside pawns and soon the Wicked Witch of the West will be making a re-appearance.} 40. Nh5 {40. Nh5?? - the game is lost but I should not be making these sorts of errors - this move was to try to distract Fou Lenoir from the protection of the h6 pawn and at least pick up a booby prize.  The only consolation I had was that at least I could resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as Freddy had not yet announced mate on me and I did not wish to drag things out.  This game btw was played before the one called "I thought Henry was as safe as houses".  I am now playing another game with Freddy and I hope for better things from that.  } Rh1+ {}
