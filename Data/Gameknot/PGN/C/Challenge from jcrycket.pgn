1. Nf3 Nc6 2. c4 e5 3. d3 d6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. Bg5 O-O 8. O-O Bg4 9. Nd5 Nd4 {Symmetry fun.} 10. Nxd4 exd4 {Symmetry was fun, but I'll keep my Queen thank you.  And I musn't forget my Knight is skewered to my Queen.} 11. Qd2 {White is increasing pressure on f6 (my skewered Knight) so I must anticipate Qf4, which would tip the exchange in Whites' favor. So... } c6 {c6 should force an even exchange. } 12. Nxf6+ Bxf6 13. Bxf6 Qxf6 {Like so...} 14. Qb4 {White Queen attacks vulnerable b7.} Bxe2 {A free pawn, and attack the Rook?  Yes, thank you, don't mind if I do.} 15. Rfc1 Rab8 16. Qd2 Bf3 17. Bxf3 Qxf3 18. Rce1 Rfe8 19. b3 Re5 20. Rxe5 dxe5 {I didn't expect the exchange, but I like the undoubled pawns.} 21. Re1 f6 22. a3 Re8 23. b4 f5 24. c5 e4 25. dxe4 {Interesting.  I could outflank with Qxa3.  But I would I like the pawn exchange?  NO!  White gains points and Center!  Do I Rxe4?  Maybe.  The Rook would protect vulnerable d4, and White would have few options, the most aggressive being Rxe4 which would leave my Queen parked in a good spot...  And last but not least, I cannot ignore the e4 Pawn.  exf5 exposes my Rook to his.   } Rxe4 26. a4 {I could play a5 and stop the advance, leaving a4 vulnerable to Qa3... But without my Queen to support, a Rook exchange would leave my opponent up 1, instead of down 1!   Perhaps I should initiate a Rook exchange.  We could trade Queens too, and start the pawn race...   Qc3 looks promising - She attacks the Rook, Queen and Pawn in one fell swoop.     But I think I like d3 best.  Pressing matters...} d3 27. Qc3 {I think I like f4} f4 28. Rxe4 {I think Black will regret this trade, for without that Rook....} Qxe4 {How can he stop my d3 pawn?} 29. Qd2 {Maybe slow it down,} Qe2 30. Qxf4 d2 {but not stop it...} 31. Qb8+ Kg7 32. Qxb7+ Kh6 {The end draws near.} 33. Qxc6 d1=Q+ {And Whit resigns!}
