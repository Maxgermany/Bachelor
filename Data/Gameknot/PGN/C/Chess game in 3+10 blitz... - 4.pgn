1. d4 d5 2. Bg5 Bf5 {my standard setup, in any Queens' pawn opening...} 3. f3 {this is a weak move: but how to profit?} e6 {I have to be honest: this reply was on autopilot; the Queen sac might be very profitable...} 4. Bxd8 Kxd8 5. a3 Nc6 6. c3 {a very bad move...} Bd6 7. Nd2 Nge7 8. e4 Bg6 9. Bd3 e5 10. Ne2 f5 11. Qc2 dxe4 12. fxe4 f4 13. O-O-O {White is trying to cope, with the luxury: at least, he is castled...} a6 14. Nf3 h6 {carefully taking out, all White moves...} 15. dxe5 Nxe5 16. Nxe5 Bxe5 {White has set up a little trap: it won't work...} 17. Bxa6+ Kc8 18. Bb5 c6 19. Bc4 b5 {relentless...} 20. Be6+ Kc7 {preparing maybe Rd7: but White doesn't trust it anymore...} 21. Bb3 {so he produces this useless move...} Rhd8 {Black loses no time...} 22. Rxd8 Rxd8 23. Rd1 Rxd1+ 24. Kxd1 {e4 has to be covered...} c5 25. Be6 {back again...} Nc6 26. Qd2 Bxe4 {now, check on d7 lost its' impact...} 27. Nxf4 {a mistake...} Kb6 28. Bd5 Bxf4 {White is losing control...} 29. Bxc6 {White cracks: after Qxf4, Bxd5, there is nothing...} Bxd2 30. Kxd2 Kxc6 31. Ke3 {realizing, what he has done, White resigns...}
