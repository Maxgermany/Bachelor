1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. O-O {Didin't want to play d3. Was punished by gmkonig in a previous game.} d6 6. h3 O-O 7. d3 {Now that he can't play Bg4} Na5 8. Bg5 a6 9. Nd5 {This is how I was punished in previous game.} Nxc4 10. dxc4 Be6 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Bh6 {Usually I win quite easily if I launch into attack before opponent remobilizes.} Re8 13. Qd3 {The idea was Kxe5 which leads to Qg3+ and then mate. A little day dreaming always helps} Kh8 {Gm read it well} 14. Nh4 {Chasing a lost cause} Rg8 {It was hard to think of a way to attack that position} 15. Nf5 Rg6 16. Qd2 Qd7 {Double attack on knight} 17. Nh4 Rgg8 {Threatening Bxh3} 18. Kh2 Bxc4 19. Rfg1 Qe6 20. b3 {I think he was not sure how to attck either. The a pawn was a rather small thing to pursue.} Bb5 21. c4 Bc6 {Shouldn't have let him attack my pawn.} 22. Qe2 Bd7 23. Qf3 {Trying to attack f5 and protect f2 from black bishop} b5 24. Rab1 {I didn't have to protect c4 from queen because of mate looming at f6, g7. I was hoping for a chance to get my rook on b7. More like a sucker punch.} c6 25. a3 {Bxa3 would lead to b4 closing out bishop from the game} f5 {Attacking my bishop} 26. Qh5 fxe4 27. Rbe1 Bxf2 {My rook should have gone somewhere else. Where was I looking?} 28. Rgf1 Bg3+ 29. Kh1 Bxe1 30. Rxf7 {gm said ouch to Rxf7 but I didn't see much into it} Rg6 31. Nxg6+ hxg6 {What? Clear mistake. Mate in 4. I made conditional move for this mate from this point on.} 32. Bg7+ Kg8 33. Rf8+ {This was the key move in this mate. Anything else and it wouldn't work. Spent some time.} Rxf8 {If he captured the bishop it Qh8 was still a mate. Inevitable after 31. ...hxg6.} 34. Qh8+ Kf7 35. Qxf8# {Not very well played in mid game but the end made up for it.}
