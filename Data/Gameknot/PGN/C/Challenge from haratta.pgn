1. e4 e6 {I tried with the French Defense. Have not played that for a long time, but I felt I need to practice on it.} 2. d4 d5 3.

Bd2 O-O {Castling Kingside is often the best choice, but not always.} 9. Bd3 Nbc6 {It´s even.} 10. Nf3 Ng6 {Threatening the weak e5-pawn.} 11. Bxg6 fxg6 12. O-O Rf5 {Again threatening the weak pawn at e5.} 13. g4 Rxf3 {A quality Rook sac.} 14.
