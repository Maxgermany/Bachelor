[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Let us begin with a Philidor Defence.  Fairly popular in the 19th Century, following the teachings of one Francois-Andre Philidor, it fell under a shadow during the 20th.  It seems to have undergone something of a revival - if a minor one - in recent decades.  It is an opening, I think, for the careful, solid player: patient, playing the cards close to the chest.  Not an opening I have ever played as Black!} 3. d4 {In my view this is the best move White can make here, though 3.Bc4 is not a bad alternative. White at once threatens to win a pawn, and may not be averse to exchanging Queens into the bargain.} Bg4 {(?) The Gameknot Engine calls this a mistake.  The pin is not particularly effective, as we'll soon see.  This was the move the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard played in their encounter with the great Paul Morphy, at the Opera in 1859.  Though Black was heavily defeated, this line continued to be played now and then in top flight chess for maybe 40 years subsequently.  It is hard to imagine why!} 4. dxe5 {Already we see the the limitations of the pin.  If now 4...dxe5, then 5.Qxd8ch Kxd8  6.Nxe5 wins a pawn and threatens a knight-fork at f7.  So what should Black play?} Nc6 {Black plays a gambit line, which says a lot about his fighting qualities!  The move the Duke and the Count played is the more usual: 4...Bxf3 5.Qxf3 dxe5 6.Bc4 Nf6 7.Qb3 ... this repeated attack against f7 has the effect of inducing the Black Queen forward a square, where it  slows down Black's development. } 5. exd6 Bxd6 {For the cost of a pawn, Black has gained a bit of time to develop his game.} 6. Be2 {Possibly too circumspect a development, and maybe tends to justify Black's third move.  The GK engine suggests 6.h3 instead, driving the bishop back to e6 or d7 and the White can develop her King's bishop to a more active posting.  It is not clear what White's response ought to be after 6.h3, Bh5, though.  Possibly 7.Bb5.} Bxf3 {Not the best.  If Black wanted to exchange B for N, he might as well have done at move 4.  Better was 6...Qe7, striking the unprotected e-pawn, and then castling Queen's side.} 7. Bxf3 Qe7 {Not quite so effective, now, as the e-pawn is protected.} 8. O-O O-O-O {Castling on opposite sides.  This can lead to an exciting race between attacks!  Black has an immediate threat ...Bxh2ch, unmasking the rook's attack against the Queen.} 9. Bd2 {Averts the danger, though subjecting herself to a sort of 'self pin'.  Whilst the Queen remains on d1, the Bishop dare not move (...Bxh2ch, remember).  A better option might have been to shift the Queen off d1 right now, allowing the bishop to develop more actively, and preparing the way for a rook to move to d1 to challenge Black's tenure of the file.} Be5 {Another threat!  Black is certainly carrying the fight to his higher ranked opponent!  It is fairly easily averted, but annoying for all that.  The play 9...Qe5 looks promising as it threatens mate, and ...Qxb2.  But it doesn't quite work like that: 9...Qe5?!10.g3 Qxb2?? 11.Bc3 Qb6 12.Bxg7 ... Oops.  An alternative to the text move was 9...Bf4.} 10. Qc1 {Rather an awkward defence, but White wanted the c3-square for her knight, so didn't play the more 'obvious' c3.  It is also possible White has an eye on the squares f4 or g5.  The other upside to this move is that the bishop is no longer constrained by the pin on the d-file.} h6 {Black could have played 10...Nf6 safely enough, and if White did play 11.Bg5, then 11...h6 would have forced a decision upon her whether or not to take.  But the move is useful to begin pawn operations against the castled King.  Developing the Knight ought to have taken precedence, though.} 11. Bc3 {Inviting an exchange.  Black can not well avoid it, on account of the unprotected g-pawn behind...} Bxc3 {...But Black did not have to play this!  Up to here the game was evenly poised, but now the scales tip, just a little, in White's favour. Instead, Black could have developed his Knight to f6, and let White, if she chose, exchange on her time.} 12. Nxc3 g5 {In the interests of attack against the castle King.  But Black probably ought to have completed his development first: 12...Nf6, and then  start thinking about attack.} 13. Bg4+ {The bishop was potentially a target on f3.  With this move, she places Black's f-pawn under restraint.} Kb8 14. Rd1 {Challenging for the open file.} Nf6 {Completing his development at last.  White has a slight edge, but no more than that.} 15. Bf5 {A very understandable move, that will make Black's King side attacking prospects problematic for some time to come.  But White could have done better than this.  Bear in mind, White is a pawn ahead!  After 15.Nd5! Nxd5 16.exd5 or 15...Qe5 16.Nxf6 Rxd1ch 17.Qxd1 Qxf6, White's extra pawn will have gained in value from the simplification of the game.  Now Black has the opportunity to cut back White's edge.} a6 {Really, rather irrelevant.  Possibly Black feared Nb5, but that was a mere spectre, with no real substance.  Correct was 15...Nd4! which would just about have forced White to accept the exchange on f5, as the Bishop had no safe retreat!  E.g. 15...Nd4 16.h3 Qe5 (or ...Nxf5) 17.g4 h5! when suddenly very interesting things are happening on the K-side.} 16. a3 {Both side seems to be taking time off from the game! It was not too late to regain the advantage with 16.Nd5!} Qe5 {An 'inaccuracy' according to the GK Engine.  The idea is right (see my note to the previous Black move), but, again 16...Nd4 ought to have come first, with the same ideas as in the previous note.  Those moves by the a-pawns really just 'marked time' for both players.} 17. Rb1 {An odd-looking move, until you realise the motivation behind it.  White intends to throw her a- and b-pawns forward in a bayonet change against Black's King.  According to the engine, better was 17.Qe3 with the idea of recapturing on d1 with the other rook.} Ne7 {In the last couple of moves, I've been pushing for ...Nd4, and it was still good here.  But this attack on the bishop from a different direction, with the same general idea of forcing the exchange, is just about as strong.} 18. Rxd8+ Rxd8 {One is inclined to think that White has rather unnecessarily ceded the d-file to Black, here.  Jo is rather given to exchanging - it is part of her style - but every now and then such exchanges are less than well motivated.  Having said that,  it is possible she wanted to deflect the enemy rook away from the K-side, where a Black attack seems to be brewing.} 19. Qe1 {19.Qe3 seems a trifle more active.} Nxf5 {There goes White's extra pawn...} 20. exf5 Qxf5 {Material equality has been restored, and so has the game.  There's nothing in it, now.  But the dramatics are by no means over!} 21. Qe7 {White wakes up with a dual threat!} Rd2 {Black's response is even more energetic: threatening mate in two, and also attacks the undefended c-pawn.} 22. Qf8+ {I feel uneasy about this move, as it seems to take the Queen out of the action.  But it is possible she was already contemplating a bale-out if ever the c5-square came available.} Ka7 23. Rf1 {Stops the immediate mate.  Possibly Jo was hoping Black might play 23...Qxc2? when 24.Qc5ch forces the draw.  I'll come back to this motif.} Ng4 {Piling the pressure on f2.  Black threatens the lethal 24...Rxf2, e.g. 24.b4?? (a 'nothing' move to illustrate the threat) 24...Rxf2  25.Rd1 Rxg2ch  26.Kxg2 Qxf2ch  27.Kh3 Qf3#.  How can White defend?} 24. f3 {A terrible and potentially fatal mistake!  This defence looks so plausible, but in fact creates a weakness that opens the gates to a lethal attack.  The text being found in error, what ought White to have played? We have seen that 24.Nd1 won't do either (see 'comments' for the previous move).  The right move was 24.Qb4!! ... with the idea 24...Rxf2?? 25.Qd4ch wins the rook.  So Black would probably have to continue  prosaically with 25...Rxc2  26.h3 Nf6, with slight edge.} Ne3 {An attractive looking move that keeps an edge.  But Black had the immediately decisive 24...Rxg2ch!! 25.Kxg2 ... (25.Kh1 Qf4 26.Qc5ch b6) 25...Qxc2ch 26.Kh3 Qxh2ch!!  27.Kxg4 Qh4ch  28.Kf5 Qf4# - an attractive king hunt with limited resources.   +++++++++ You might ask, how could anyone 'see' this kind of sacrificial combination?  The possibility of a mate in the corner would certainly attract the eye of an experienced tactician at least to the possibility of ...Rxg2ch.  The question becomes what happens after 26.Kh3 - does the King escape?  } 25. Rf2 {White had the threats to g2, f1, and c2 to be concerned with.  This rook move is an obvious defence (as 23.f3 was), but this time it is good enough! } Qxc2 {A very nasty threat, but overlooks White's saving resource.   Instead, 25...Rxf2 26.Kxf2 Nxc2 would have given Black an extra pawn though in a difficult and technical Queen and Knight end game.  Probably better would have been to avoid the exchange and regroup by 25...Rd6.  Black would have been well placed to prepare another assault against the King, bringing up the pawns the wrench open White's defences. } 26. Qc5+ Kb8 27. Qf8+ {Well played!  But why not take the Knight?  Answer: 27.Qxe3?? Qc1ch  28.Rf1 Rxg2ch!!  29.Kxg2 Qxe3 with a probably winning advantage for Black.  Jo plays it cool, and stands for no nonsense.} Ka7 28. Qc5+ Kb8 {Note that ...b6 makes no worthwhile difference, as by checking on c7 and c8, White will still force the three-fold repetition of the position.} 29. Qf8+ Ka7 30. Qc5+ {Draw: three-fold repetition of position.  A good result for Gerhard - very good result.  For her part, Jo stood up well to adversity to escape with a draw with the enemy hammering at the gates.  Neither should beat themselves up too much over the missed chances at move 24. The correct defence for White would have been very hard to find; and, to exploit the lapse, Black would have had to contemplate sacrificing two of his remaining three pieces to achieve the checkmate.  Fine game!}
