1. Nf3 {Sam opens with knight} d5 2. d4 e5 {I offer pawn as sacrafice for development in a dutch-ish gambit opening} 3. e4 dxe4 {Sam declines, I threaten knight} 4. Nxe5 {Bad move from me} Bd6 5. f4 f6 6. Nc4 b5 7. Nxd6+ cxd6 8. Bxb5+ Bd7 9. Nc3 {Sam is protecting his bishop, believing I wont want to trade} Bxb5 10. Nxb5 {I trade, realising i can gain material. from Qa5} Qa5+ 11. Bd2 Qxb5 {I am now up 2} 12. Bc3 Nc6 {I develop the knight} 13. a4 Qf5 {move to protect my queen} 14. b3 {Sam playing uncharacteristically poorly. A very open board, he develops along the side, instead of moving the rooks to the centre, and makes no move to protect his pawn.} Qxf4 {I simply take it.} 15. Qh5+ g6 {I threaten sams queen} 16. Rf1 {He threatens mine back, I dont want to lose it though, because mine is in a better position, and I also see a fork} Qe3+ 17. Qe2 {Typical move, forced really, unless sam wanted to lose the queen needlessly} Qxc3+ 18. Qd2 Qxa1+ {unfortunately, he didnt see the consecutive bishop rook attack....} 19. Ke2 Nxd4+ {I go on to win} 20. Ke3 Qxf1 21. Qxd4 Qg1+ 22. Kxe4 Qxg2+ 23. Kd3 Rc8 24. Qe3+ Ne7 {}
