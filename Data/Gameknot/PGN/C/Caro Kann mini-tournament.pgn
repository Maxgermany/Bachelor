1. e4 {Caro Kann} c6 2. d4 e6 {Black deviates to instead build a hedgehog structure.} 3. Nf3 b6 4. c4 Ne7 5. Nc3 Ng6 {The Black Knight eyes f4, an important battleground in this game.} 6. Bd3 Be7 7. Be3 {White develops and keeps the his center solid. Black is a bit behind.} Na6 8. a3 d6 9. O-O O-O 10. Qc2 e5 11. d5 {A black Knight on e4 will create problems for white, though perhaps could have been overcome by a rook on d1.} c5 {Black tries to close things up, making it a knights game.} 12. Nd2 {Here I start to look Queen side to open up the b file. Blacks knight on a6 is a bit exposed.} Nc7 13. b4 Nf4 {Black starts to roll a king side attack. I'd gladly give up my bad light squared bishop for this knight.} 14. Ne2 {Black should take this Knight, but doesn't.} g5 15. bxc5 {Seeking to open the Q side. I've got nothing to look forward to on the k side except fending off a black attack. My attack looks to be slower, so I better get going on it.} bxc5 16. Bxf4 {My dark bishop is "good" but his knight is better, an the doubled pawns on the f file will slow him down.} gxf4 17. Rab1 {Taking the open file before he does.} Ne8 {Black is all about the king side attack. I have no real plan yet, just trying to pick up small advantages. At this point I own an open file and have two knights in a position with a closed center. I have a bad light bishop I'd love to exchange.} 18. Nc3 Ng7 19. Nf3 Bg4 {If black exchanges, I'm getting rid of his good bishop, leaving a slew of potential homes for my remaining knight (b5,c6 and f5), and b7 is wide open for my rook.} 20. Be2 h5 21. Rb7 {a7 is in trouble after Qa4.} h4 22. Nd2 {A retreat to c8 might be in order to get my rook out of the 7th rank.} Bxe2 23. Nxe2 Bg5 24. h3 {Further restricting this nearly useless bishop.} f5 {Black has to open the king side, but I'd be thrilled to put my knight on e4, to pressure the backwards pawn on d6.} 25. Qa4 Rf7 26. Rfb1 Qc8 {The a pawn requires constant attention, and black's minor pieces are out of the action. But what's the action? } 27. Qc6 {Qc6!! Pressuring d6. Black is forced to exchange. I can afford to break up the center because my knights are ready to jump in to gain control (Nc3-d5). My hope is to win the a pawn and drive my a pawn to victory.} Qxc6 28. dxc6 Rc8 29. Rxf7 Kxf7 30. Rb7+ Kf8 31. c7 {Hoping eventually to trade off the rooks so that Black can't penetrate to my now weakened queen side and to give my knights room to dominate. If he brings the knight over, the f5 pawn will be weakened, and create a great home on e4 for my knight. And recapturing my passed f pawn will prove difficult.} Ne8 32. Rxa7 Rxc7 {I think taking with the knight would have been better here. d4 is open and he could have swung the Knight there.} 33. Rxc7 Nxc7 34. exf5 Ke7 {Black sees the d6 and bishop fork coming.} 35. f3 {Before jumping to e4, its important to hem in teh bishop again and prevent counterattack.} Kf6 36. Ne4+ {Black's knight is still of little use, black chooses to let the d pawn go to stop one of my two passed pawns. I have no intention of trading my powerful knight for his bad bishop.} Kxf5 37. Nxd6+ Ke6 38. Ne4 Be7 39. Kf1 {I've got the king side locked down -- black has no more play left there. My king heads to the a pawn.} Kf5 {Black's king is blocking his knight, and my king is able to head straight over to the a pawn while black struggles to come up with useful moves.} 40. Ke1 Ne6 41. Ne2c3 Nd4 42. Kd2 {The black c pawn is ready to drop.} Nb3+ 43. Kc2 Nd4+ 44. Kb2 Ke6 45. Na4 Nf5 {Black is setting up to take my g pawn.} 46. Naxc5+ Bxc5 47. Nxc5+ Kd6 48. Nd3 {Once the black knight eats my g pawn, he'll need to get to e1 to do any further damage, but my knight will prevent that.} Ne3 49. Kb3 Nxg2 50. c5+ Kd5 51. Kb4 Kd4 52. c6 {Hmmm..the annotation seems to be following a variation here and not the real game. 52.c6 leads to problems as you'll see following the next few moves. in the actual game, i played 52.Ne1, offering to sacrifice my N. Black wisely avoided the sacrifice because then his N would have been too far away to catch up to my advancing c pawn. Instead, black sent his N back to the center, but I advanced my a pawn and he had to resume his attack on my g pawn which did eventually give him two connected passed pawns but I queened and got back to defend just in time.} Ne3 53. c7 Nd5+ {}
