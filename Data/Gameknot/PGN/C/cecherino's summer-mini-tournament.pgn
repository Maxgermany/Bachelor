1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 {King's Gambit Accepted.} 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 {4. h4 is I think objectively better here.   This move gives black the option of the fun Muzio Gambit (4. ... g4 5. O-O PxN 6. QxP), or of simply consolidating his position, as my opponent did here.} Bg7 5. d4 d6 6. h3 h6 {White's position is already a bit cramped; black's king-side pawn chain is quite strong.} 7. O-O Nc6 8. c3 Nf6 9. Nbd2 O-O 10. Bd3 {We've reached what is basically every King's Gambit's player's nightmare; black is simply better, and it's hard to formulate a plan for white.   The text is pretty much a waiting move; the knight is unable to get to a square from where it can target f7, so the bishop will likely be better deployed on the b1-h7 diagonal.} Re8 11. Re1 Bd7 12. Nc4 {Aiming to support an e5 push without ending up with an isolated e-pawn.} Nh5 13. e5 {13. Nxg5 is refuted by ... QxN, and the knight on h5 is covered.   So I go with the pawn break I'd prepared the move before.} d5 14. Ncd2 {Nowhere else to go really} Ng3 15. Nf1 {Swapping off should benefit the player behind in development.   I don't think black can allow white to start the trade (16. NxN PxN); the pawn on g3 may be too weak.} Nxf1 16. Rxf1 Ne7 {Aiming to put his second knight in on g3.   It's not entirely clear if g3 is that great a square for the knight though.} 17. h4 {Again, white needs to get some space to play in.} Nf5 18. hxg5 Ng3 {Gameknot analysis gives this as the first blunder of the game; instead, black should have re-taken, when best is 19. NxP QxN 20. BxP, when white is a piece for pawn down, but at least has some counter-play opportunities; a sharp game should ensue.} 19. Bxf4 {!   For the rook, white will get a pawn wedged deep in black's position, and I will of course recoup the knight at my leisure.} Nxf1 {Black goes for it; he's just a pawn down if he backs out.} 20. gxh6 Bh8 {? The king is better placed here.   Gameknot reckons instead on 20. ... Ng3, forcing white to waste a move recapturing.   Material would then be even, but white is on the attack.} 21. h7+ Kg7 22. Bg5 {Taking a moment to force the queen to a less active square   So bad is black's position here that gameknot analysis recommends 22. ... Ng3!} Qc8 23. Qxf1 {?   23. Bf6+ Kf8 24. Qc1! is the best way to continue; the gameknot line ends with white up a queen and two pieces for a rook!   It's an interesting line - 24. ... RxP (to give the king a flight square) 25. Qh6+ Ke8 26. BxB Bf5 (for both sides, the pawn on h7 is more valuable than the exchange (BxR)) 27. BxR BxP 28. QxB Ne3 29. Re1 NxP (a desperate attempt to get counterplay by opening up the white king's position, I assume) 30. Qh8+ Ke7 31. Bd6+! KxB (PxB isn't possible as it's double check) 32. Qf6 Qe6 33. RxQ+ PxR 34. KxN.} Bf5 {With the simple threat of BxP, and black's position is holdable.} 24. Qb1 {Fritz doesn't like this, preferring instead to get the knight involved - 24. Bf6+ Kf8 25. Ng5.   Hard to argue against that, in fairness.} Bxd3 25. Qxd3 Qg4 26. Kf2 {Looking to get the rook involved via h1} Re6 27. Bf6+ {Finally playing the move Fritz had been calling for for the past few moves.   27. ... Kh6 loses to Rh1+, 27. ... Kf8 loses to BxB, so the only option is to give up the exchange.} Rxf6 28. exf6+ Kxf6 {Black gets a pawn for the exchange, but white's rook has another file to play on, and black's king is dragged more into the centre.} 29. Rh1 {Looking to enter the game via h4 (rather than h6, where there seems to be nothing after 30. ... Kg7)} Qe4 30. Qd2 {Obviously not interested in a swap when black's king is where it is!   31. Qg5+ Ke7 32. Qg8 is the threat now.} Qf5 31. Qh6+ {? Again, not the most accurate way of continuing the attack.   Gameknot prefers 31. g4!, opening up the g-file; the rook is eyeing g8, when black must lose material.   So for example 31. ... QxP (other moves allow the likes of Qg5+ and Rh6+) 32. Rg1 Qf5 33. Rg8 QxP 34 RxR and black can resign.} Ke7 32. Re1+ Kd7 33. Kg1 {Unpinning the knight so it can take part in the game.} c6 {Not sure what the purpose of this move was; gameknot recommends the logical ... Qg6, attempting to swap queens.} 34. Ne5+ Bxe5 35. Rxe5 {? A blunder, says gameknot, but still enough for black to call it a day here.   35. PxB, which I had been considering, is better; I'd missed that after 35. ... Qb1+ 36. Kh2 Rh8 37. Qf6 that ... RxP is check.   White is still winning, but there's plenty for black to fight over.   35. PxB covers white's back rank, and means black has to deal with the threats of h8=Q and Qd6+  Still, at my level, it's too much to ask for an attack on gameknot to be perfect; this one was fun, and the analysis instructive, so that's enough for me!}
