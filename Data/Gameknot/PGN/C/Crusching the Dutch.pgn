1. d4 f5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nbd2 g6 5. e3 Bg7 6. h4 {This is an almost thematic move against the Dutch. h5 is in sight.} Nc6 7. Be2 {I need to threat BxN after h5.} b6 8. Nc4 {Aiming to e5. Black can defend with d6, but this seems to be uncoherent with the Bb7 plan.} Nd5 9. Bg5 Nde7 {Better would have been Bc6. This keeps the knight pinned.} 10. h5 {Of course...} d5 {hxg6 is ok, but I have a good grimp on black's position with...} 11. h6 Bf8 12. Bf6 Rg8 {Now, I want to place a knight on g5, aiming to h7. For some reason I didn't do it just now. (you know, blitz...)} 13. Nce5 Qd6 14. a4 {Dreaming of supporting the bishop on b5 as for some trick pinning the king. } Bd7 {Ah, but then...} 15. Ba6 {No castling, and no a6. } Nxe5 16. Bxe5 {Black overlooks Qb4+, Qd2, Qxb2, o-o but probably he feared a rook trap with Bxc7 and Bb7.} Qc6 17. Bb5 Qb7 18. Ng5 {So, finally I got there.} c6 19. Be2 O-O-O {Finally, black castles. Ok. but...} 20. Nxh7 {...and after Nc6, black cannot stop the pawn without losing a piece. Apart from this, a5 is a strong attack, once prepared. }
