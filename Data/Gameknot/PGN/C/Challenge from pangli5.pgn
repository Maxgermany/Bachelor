1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. d4 e6 5. e4 d6 {my favorite opening, i think} 6. Bg5 {i don't do that usually. I guess i was pointing for a draw} h6 7. Bd2 Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. Bd3 e5 10. h3 c6 11. O-O Bd7 12. a3 Qc7 13. Rc1 c5 14. b4 b6 15. Be3 O-O 16. Qd2 Kh7 17. Rc2 Nfg8 18. Rb1 Nc8 19. Rcb2 Nge7 {until then, if he had offered me the draw, i think i would have accepted.} 20. Nh4 f5 21. f4 {after i played this i really thought: "did i make a mistake?" I wanted to open the space to his king. Most of his pieces were looking to my queen size or were blocked: see the two knights! But on the other way, i was exposing my pieces to the pawns ant the black bishop on g7.} cxb4 22. axb4 exf4 {here is the black bishop and my queen is overcharged.} 23. exf5 {so i decided to bet on the loss of my black bishop in exchange of the attack on g6.} Bxf5 {but he refused} 24. Nxf5 fxe3 25. Nxe3 {and so... no benefits... as it seems...} a6 26. Rc2 h5 27. Ne4 {but, as you left me most of my pieces, they will attack on your king side} Bh6 28. Qe1 Qd7 29. Rf2 Rxf2 30. Qxf2 Ng8 31. g4 hxg4 32. Nxg4 {And now I have a powerful attack. I thought I had the lead here} Qg7 {necessary} 33. Rf1 Rb8 34. Ngf6+ Nxf6 35. Qxf6 {i really hesitated the 34-35 moves, but I haven't found the clue. Then I realized my main attack had to be a diversion for a fight on queen side.} Rb7 {this amazed me} 36. Qxg7+ {why not Kxd6? because  35.	Qxf6	Rb7 36.	Nxd6	Nxd6 37.	Qxd6	Qd4+ and the bishop falls} Kxg7 37. c5 {and here is my attack on queen side} Be3+ 38. Kg2 bxc5 39. bxc5 Bxc5 {i had preferred to keep my knight here, if he had taken with the pawn, but still haven't seen wrong } 40. Nxc5 dxc5 41. Bxa6 Rc7 42. Kg3 {and now i made a terrible mistake... somewhere here. I am very sad because i had a strong attack, at least to force the draw... And now I lose.} Nd6 43. Rf4 {this is the worst!!!!} c4 {because of this of course. Anyway, pangli defended correctly, and I am not sure i had a true attack, conclusive, etc. I should have proponed the draw two moves sooner} 44. Rf1 Ra7 45. Bxc4 {45.	Ra1	Ne4+ 46.	Kf4	Nc5} Nxc4 46. Rc1 Nd6 47. Kf4 Rd7 48. Ke5 Kf7 49. Rf1+ Nf5 50. h4 Re7+ 51. Kf4 Kg7 52. h5 gxh5 53. Kg5 Ne3 54. Rh1 Re5+ 55. Kf4 Kf6 56. d6 Nd5+ 57. Kg3 Ke6 {well done, pal}
