[Opening "King's knight opening (C40)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bc5 3. Bc4 {Black recommend Nxe5, gaining a piece and a knight on a central square.  I disagree, going with the notion that one should develop as many pieces as possible in the opening.} d6 {I think this is a defensive move, but it does open the line for the bishop.} 4. O-O {Black believes that there was nothing to gain at this moment from castling.} Nf6 5. Nc3 Ng4 6. Ng5 {I made this move then immediately regretted it.  I had hung my knight.} Qxg5 {Not only that, but I let his queen get into the game quickly.} 7. Nd5 Qh5 {I see the mate threat by Qxh2.} 8. Re1 {Yuck!} Bxf2+ 9. Kf1 {Black says he could have toyed with me badly right there.  However, had he moved anything other than taking my rook, I would have moved my rook to e2, to safety.  The only other move that my rook would be in trouble with was moving the g4 knight.} Bxe1 {Which is why, he says, he did not toy with me.} 10. Nxc7+ {I forked him almost as bad as he had forked me earlier.} Kd8 11. Nxa8 {Took the rook.  Now my knight is trapped, however, so this move meant nothing.} Qxh2 12. Kxe1 {Much better, both Black and I agree, was Qxe1, which put the queen on an open line.} Qg1+ {I think that it would have been better to take the pawn outright.  This would force me to concede my queen} 13. Ke2 {Forced} Qxg2+ 14. Ke1 {Black recommends Kd3.  In retrospect, this was the better move, allowing my queen to get to e1 and get into the game, which she should have been a few moves ago.  It also leaves a few more moves in the game.} Qg3+ {Missing the mating move, which was Qf2.} 15. Ke2 {I decided definitely not Kf1 followed by Qf2#.} Qg2+ 16. Ke1 {I fall right back into the trap like the idiot that I am.  I know I am in some trouble, I try for the draw.} Nh2 {And he misses the mate again.  But he does change the position, preventing the draw by threefold repetition that I was hoping for.} 17. d3 {I should have played d4.  Either way, I was in deeper than most people can get out, and I didn't make it out this time.} Bg4 18. Qd2 {I needed to have both of those squares free, and I was dumb enough to leave one of them occupied.} Qg1# {They say that if you play for a draw, you're going to lose more often than not.  That's what happened to me this game.  Black showboated for a couple minutes after this game, but I deserved it because I sucked.}
