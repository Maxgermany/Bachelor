1. d4 g6 2. Bf4 {My London system doesn't work so well against the fianchetto, but I like to play it anyway.} Bg7 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. h3 {Offrecords move. Its purpose it is not to block g5, but rather to prepare a pawn storm on the kingside. } O-O {He sees it very far. He's right.} 5. c3 {c4 is the standard, but I want to castle queenside so to push everyting on the king. The problem is he will go for the queenside, but he's completely undeveloped there. I'll go first. } e6 6. Nbd2 {I "threat" e4, so he went... } d5 {...and this is acceptable. I didn't intend to push for d5 anyway. } 7. e3 {I can go e4 here, but my plan is another. Ne5 and g4-g5-h4-h5.} Bd7 8. Ne5 {Well, it is supposed to be done later, but just in case, I prefer to take one of his bishops (the bad one, but still a good piece for black. My other knight can easily replace it if needed.} a6 {...specially with such tempo wastes from black. } 9. g4 b6 {More tempo wasting? Maybe. } 10. g5 {I should have waited and prepare this with Be2. I just was in a hurry to attack before he actually do something. } Ne8 {Interesting, as Nh5 could be played, and if I go Be2, NxB is good for black. } 11. h4 {Looking for h5. Now I segret to have played h3.} c5 {here he goes. } 12. dxc5 {Bad. I should have taken the tempo for h5, and wait for him to exchange. But I confess I was tarting to be tempted by the weak black's queenside. } bxc5 13. h5 {Ok, back to my previous plan. One should NEVER do this on chess. } Nc6 {Aha, here he goes. I prefer to take advantage on the light squares. } 14. Nxd7 Qxd7 15. Ne4 {Maybe not the best, but I couldn't resist. In fact it is bad: after Qe7, I don't have a good spot for the knight. } f5 {Blunder. } 16. Nxc5 {Two in one!} Qe7 {Too late. } 17. Nd3 {I preferred this to Nb3, it was important to me to control e5. Which I fail doing.} e5 18. Qa4 {Ok, I had a light square advantage on the queenside, right? So let's use it! IN fact, it would have been much better Nxe5, NxN, Qxd5+, followed by QxR or better (Nf7, shielding from the check, hxg6, hxg6, and speculate with it before taking the rook)} Qe6 {So the queen's chase starts...} 19. Nc5 Qc8 20. hxg6 {Just taking advantage of the fact that if exB, he might be scared by gxh7+, when in fact this is not that dangerous as it seems. I'll have a good grimp, but a bishop less...} hxg6 {Retiring the bishop? No, never! it means I have to go backwards! :-)} 21. Bxa6 Rxa6 {He decides to exchange, correctly. } 22. Nxa6 exf4 {So the bishop is taken, but I am still +1 on the count. } 23. exf4 {Qh4 is interesting, but the king has f2, so I thought I had not much to do there. } Nd6 {Good race for a good spot. } 24. O-O-O {I laughted, since I finally castled long, but in what position... } Ne4 {go back? Never! :-)} 25. Rxd5 {Black lost the game letting me take this pawn. } Bxc3 {A good try!!!!!!! I don't like the fork, even if Qb3. NxR, QxR+, Kg7 and my attack is stopped!} 26. Qc4 {Take this! :-P It is a brilliancy? :-)} Bxb2+ {Just as me, he goes for everything or nothing. } 27. Kxb2 Qb7+ 28. Kc2 {...so what? My king, rather incredibly, is safe, and I am one move from Rd7 and mate. } Rb8 {He played this - sure it slipped in a blunder - and resigned. A pity, but I think black was cooked. Do you agree? This is the quiz...}
