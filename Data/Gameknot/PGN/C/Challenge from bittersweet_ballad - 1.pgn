1. e4 {A very interesting game, involving an exchange sacrifice on move 20. A similar game can be found here: http://gameknot.com/anbd.pl?bd=6346016&fb=1&rnd=0.6536950532319957} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7 7. Qg4 O-O 8. Bd3 Nbc6 9. Qh5 Ng6 10. Nf3 Qc7 11. Be3 {I am not sure whether this is book or not. However, the c3 square for white is weak, and I would have considered Bd2 a better move. This would have given white the ability to save a tempo protecting the c3 square when attacked by black; and an attack on this square seems almost inevitable, because of it's weakness.} c4 12. Bxg6 fxg6 13. Qg4 Bd7 14. h4 {white has probably decided not to castle. probably looking to open the h file and pile up on it.} Rf5 15. h5 gxh5 16. Rxh5 Rxh5 17. Qxh5 Rf8 18. Ng5 {When white played this, this move looked very weak. The N has to go back anyway after h6. Also, inducing black to move the h-pawn to a dark square doesn't seem right, considering that white has a dark-squared bishop.  However, white's 24th move, Bxh6 would not have been effective at winning the h-pawn had white not played 18.Ng5. So as it turns out, Ng5 probably did pay off, but was the aim similar to what it helped white achieve?} h6 19. Nf3 Be8 {In retrospect, I think Qa5 should have been played. Or maybe even Qb6. They both lead to interesting attacks on white's weak queen side.} 20. Qh3 Rxf3 {!? The idea behind this exchange sacrifice is that in this position minor pieces would be able to exert more influence than the clumsy rook. White's rook doesn't move at all from it's home square. On the other hand the knight could have exerted quite a lot of influence.} 21. Qxf3 {At the time I played Rxf3, I considered gxf3 to be better for white.} Bg6 22. Kd2 {!} Qb6 23. Qg4 Bxc2 {Another possiblity was 23..Ne7. An interesting position arose after this line in my analysis: 24.Kc1 Bxc2 25.Bxh6 Nf5 26.Bd2 Qb3 27.g3?? White's last move is a terrible mistake. Although white had a considerable advantage at first, now the best white can do is play for a draw. Heres why: 27..Nxd4! 28.cxd4 c3! Now white is forced to play 29.Qxe6  and keep black in perpetual check so as to avoid a major loss of material. For example, the only other move which does not allow mate is 29.Bxc3. This would be followed by 29..Bf5 (but not Qxc3, which allows 30.Qxe6 draw) 30.Qxf5 Qxc3 31.Qc2 Qxa1 and black is winning.  However, if white had played almost anything other than 27.g3, like 27.a4, then 27..Nxd4 would not have worked, because 28.cxd4 c3 29.Qxe6 Kh7 30.Qh3, and white simply takes on c3 on his next move, leaving black in ruins.} 24. Bxh6 {This is what I refered to in my analysis of 18.Ng5. Had white not played 18.Ng5, black would not have played h6, and the capture of the pawn with the bishop on this move would not have been possible. Was this foresight, or simply luck? I can't say.} Bg6 {forced} 25. Qxg6 Qb2+ {forced. black is now looking to draw at best} 26. Kd1 Qxa1+ 27. Ke2 Qb2+ 28. Bd2 Kf8 {The e-pawn cannot be saved. This move (followed by Ne7) was played to save atleast the d-pawn.} 29. Qxe6 Ne7 30. f3 {robs black's queen of the e4 square where it could potentially end up to harass white's king.} Qc2 {an attempt to trap white into a perpetual. Only one move could help white resist a draw. White played exactly that.} 31. Qg4 {The only move which prevents black from drawing. If white had played anything other than this move, then 31..Qd3 32.Ke1 Qb1 33.Kf2 Qc2 would have forced a draw by repetition. The key for white was to bring the queen to a square from where it could move to the c1-h6 diagonal when needed, to protect the bishop, and thus allow the king to move away.} Kf7 {bringing in king to e6 to thwart white's pawns from advancing} 32. Qg5 b5 33. g4 a5 34. Qf4+ Ke6 35. Qe3 Qh7 36. f4 {already looks like a draw now.} g6 37. Qg3 Qh1 38. f5+ gxf5 39. gxf5+ Kxf5 40. Qf2+ Ke6 41. Qf6+ Kd7 {Draw. It is impossible for white to breakthrough, because black may force white into a perpetual if white plays a non-check move (such as taking the b5 pawn).}
