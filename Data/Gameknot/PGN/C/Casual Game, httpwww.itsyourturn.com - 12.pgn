1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 b5 {These attempts to hang onto the pawn rarely end well. } 4. a4 c6 5. axb5 {My experience has been that sometimes white has to worry about Qa5+, so it is better to open the A file first.} cxb5 6. b3 {Black who has no developed pieces can stay in the game with Nf6 or e6.  6... e6 7. bxc4 bxc4 8. e3 Nf6 9. Bxc4 Be7} cxb3 { } 7. e3 {Or Qxb3.    Here black can survive with 7... b4 8. Ne5 with a pretty good game for white. Nf6 9. Bc4 Be6 (9... e6 10. Qf3  Is crushing.) 10. Bxe6 fxe6 11. Qxb3} a6 8. Bxb5+ Bd7 {Now 9. Bc4 has some problems where black can play Nc6 and threaten Na5 with a possible Bb5 to follow.} 9. Bxd7+ Nxd7 10. Qxb3 {Black's position is so bad that he is already losing, but he should probably play e6 or Nf6 and try to complete his development. } Rb8 11. Qa4 {I like this move because I think that it is putting the most pressure on black.  The computer thinks that anywhere on the A file is fine and that Qc2 is good also. } Qc8 {Again black neglects his development.  He is clearly losing now.  It should be obvious that the black queen on c8 will eventually be a target.  } 12. Bd2 {O-O and Ba3 are just as good. } Ngf6 13. O-O Rb6 {Black completely neglects his development.  His position is on the verge of collapse.  13... e6 14. Rc1 Qb7 15. Na3 Be7 16. Rab1 Qa8 17. Rxb8+ Qxb8 18. Ne5 Qb7 19. Nac4 O-O 20. Nc6 Bd8 21. Bb4 Re8 22. Nd6 } 14. Rc1 Qb7 {On this square the queen will come under attack.  14. ... Qa8 is better. } 15. Ba5 {Black should play Nd5 and just give up the exchange. } Rd6 {Here White could play Rc7 or he could play ... } 16. Nbd2 {Na3, Ra2 and Rc7 are also good. } Nd5 { } 17. Rab1 {Nc4 and Ne5 are also playable. } Qa8 {Now White can win with either 18. Nc4, 18. Ne4, 18. Ne5 or 18. Bc7.} 18. Ne4 {Here 18. ... f5 prevents mate. If 18. ... Re6  19. Nc5 Nf6  20. Ne5 Rd6  21. Ncxd7 Nxd7  2. Rc7 is a killer.   } Rh6 19. Ne5 {Black resigns.  There is no preventing checkmate.  The black queen is not in a position to prevent Qxd7 without either getting captured or allowing Rc8 mate.  If any of the other pieces protect d7 then they get captured as well.  For example ... } Rc6 20. Rxc6 e6 {Now Rxa6 or the very pretty alternative of 21. Rc8+ Qxc8 22. Rb8! Be7 23. Qxd7+} 21. Rxa6 Qc8 22. Ra8 Be7 23. Rxc8+ {Or 23. Qxd7+} Bd8 24. Rxd8+ { Or 24. Qxd7+ }
