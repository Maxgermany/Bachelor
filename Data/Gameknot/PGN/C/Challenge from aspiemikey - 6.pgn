1. e4 e5 2. d4 d6 3. dxe5 dxe5 {The d-file is open...} 4. Qxd8+ {...so I remove my opponent's queen...} Kxd8 {...forcing his king out of his starting position, so he cannot castle.} 5. Nf3 {I attack his pawn...} f6 {...but he covers it.} 6. Be3 {Now I bring up my bishop...} h6 7. Nh4 {...and eye up his rook and bishop...} Rh7 {...but he is wise to this...} 8. Nc3 {...so I bring up my other knight...} Bb4 9. O-O-O+ {...enabling me to castle, bringing my rook into play, checking my opponent.} Nd7 10. Bc4 {I eye up his other knight...} Ne7 {...but he is again wise to this...} 11. Nd5 {...so I attack it again...} g5 {...and he attacks mine...} 12. Nxf6 {...but I bring its twin on the attack, eyeing up an even better piece (a rook), noticing that the d7 knight is keeping the king out of check.} Rf7 {That was a real blooper there...} 13. Bxf7 {...as the bishop accepts the gift of a more superior rook...} gxh4 {...in exchange for a less superior knight...} 14. Nxd7 {...and I deem it worth removing one myself, with a slight advantage, especially with more horizontal/vertical power...} Bxd7 {...in exchange for my remaining knight...} 15. Be6 {...allowing me to line up the bishop as that is now the piece that is keeping the king out of check...} Bd6 16. Bxd7 {...which I remove...} Kxd7 {...at the expense of mine...} 17. Bc5 {...so I line up the other bishop...} b6 18. Bxd6 {...and remove it...} cxd6 {...but lose mine, creating yet more space on the board. A 15 point steal in seven moves against 12.} 19. Rd3 Rg8 20. g3 {This was to stop the remaining rook from getting too deep...} hxg3 21. hxg3 {...so I open up the far right-hand side.} Rg6 22. f4 exf4 23. gxf4 {I decided to swap a pawn apiece, as I am ahead, even if my advantage is slight.} Nc6 24. Rdh3 {I double up on the far side to line up the pawn...} Rg4 25. Rh3h4 {...but line up the rook to save mine...} Rg3 26. Rh4xh6 {...and take my opponent's pawn then.} Nd4 27. Rh6h7+ Kc6 28. Kd1 Rg2 {My opponent moves his rook deep...} 29. Rh7h2 {..so I line it up...} Rg4 {...to repel it...} 30. Rd2 {...so I line up the knight...} Nf3 31. Rd3 {...and again...} Rxf4 {...and my opponent removes a pawn...} 32. Rf1 {...allowing me to split the rook and knight, with the latter under attack from both rooks...} Rxe4 {...so he removes another pawn...} 33. Rfxf3 {...and I do likewise to his knight, doubling my rooks on the 3rd rank.} a5 34. Rdc3+ Kd5 {This played into my hands here...} 35. Rfd3+ {...as I could check him again...} Ke6 36. Rde3 {...allowing me to pin his rook down to the e-file...} Kd5 37. Rxe4 {...so I remove it...} Kxe4 {...at the expense of one of mine.} 38. Rb3 {The rook can play the role of the "predator"...} Kd5 39. Rxb6 {...and the b-pawn is its "prey"...} Kc5 40. Rb3 a4 41. Rc3+ {...but it has to retreat, and I line up the king this time.} Kb5 42. a3 {Now the a-pawn cannot escape...} d5 43. b3 {...so I attack it here...} axb3 {...giving my opponent no option to take my b-pawn...} 44. cxb3 {...creating two passed pawns on my left-hand side.} d4 45. Rd3 {Now I line up his final pawn...} Kc5 46. b4+ {...and push one of mine up...} Kc4 47. Kd2 {...and defend my rook...} Kd5 48. b5 {...and keep the pawn moving...} Kc5 49. Rxd4 {...and deem it worth removing the pawn, as removing the rook gives my b-pawn a clear run, while removing the pawn would allow my rook to get back or bring my king up to it.} Kxd4 {He takes the rook...} 50. b6 {...so I push the pawn.}
