[Opening "Owen defence (B00)"]

1. e4 b6 {I thought I'd start by fianchettoing the queenside bishop instead of the usual kingside.  This is known as Owen's defense, and according to Wikipedia (which is always right), it has a rather dubious reputation.  I not only cede the center early, but I also delay kingside castling for a while.} 2. Qf3 Bb7 3. Bc4 {Hey look- almost checkmated three moves in} e6 4. Nc3 f5 5. exf5 exf5 {As pointed out in the comments, Bxf3 to steal the queen was definitely the better move} 6. Qxf5 {Not particularly sure what I was thinking with that exchange- I must have just miscalculated} Qe7+ 7. Nge2 Nc6 {The correct move would have been Bxg2} 8. Bxg8 g6 {I was too stingy to give up another pawn, and I think I paid for it.} 9. Qd5 Na5 10. Bf7+ {QxB would probably have been better, although the Fritz chess engine has them about equal.} Kd8 11. Qd4 Qxf7 12. Qxh8 Qg7 {I missed Bxg2 again here} 13. Qxg7 Bxg7 {Now I'm a rook and a pawn down, with no chance to castle and my knight at the edge of the board.  On the plus side, my bishops are very well placed.} 14. O-O Nc4 15. d3 Nd6 16. Bf4 Ke7 {Giving my rook a way to get out.} 17. Bxd6+ Kxd6 18. a4 Re8 19. Nb5+ Ke7 20. Rab1 Kd8 21. Rfe1 Re5 22. d4 Rg5 23. g3 Bf8 {The pawn at d4 was quite well defended, so I guess I just wanted a little more mobility} 24. h4 Rf5 25. Nxa7 c5 26. g4 Rf3 27. b4 Rh3 {Rather last ditch effort to get a checkmate} 28. Ng3 Bd6 29. bxc5 Bxg3 30. fxg3 Rxg3+ 31. Kh2 Rg2+ 32. Kh3 Bf3 33. Rxb6 Rxg4 34. c6 g5 35. Re3 Rxh4+ 36. Kg3 Bd1 37. Rb8+ Kc7 38. Rc8+ Kb6 39. Kg2 Rg4+ 40. Rg3 Rxd4 41. Rd3 Rg4+ {I was looking very hard for a perpetual check to get the draw} 42. Kf1 Rf4+ 43. Ke1 Bxc2 44. Rxd7 Re4+ 45. Kd2 Bxa4 46. Rb8+ Kc5 47. c7 {I think this was a mistake by white- he's willing to sacrifice his rook to promote a pawn, but he can't promote the pawn after Bxd7.} Bxd7 48. Rh8 {Pawn grabbing time.} Kd6 49. Kd3 {This might have been a mistake by me.  I was willing to sacrifice my rook to take his pawn, thinking he couldn't do much with the rook and knight against my bishop and two pawns.} Kxc7 50. Kxe4 g4 {The only safe place for that pawn- I was hoping to eventually trade the pawn and my bishop for his rook.} 51. Kf4 Kd6 52. Rxh7 Kc7 53. Rh5 Kd6 {Not sure why I didn't move to b6 instead} 54. Rh1 Kc7 55. Rb1 Kd6 56. Nb5+ Ke7 57. Nd4 Kf6 {Trading the bishop for the knight wasn't acceptable} 58. Rb7 Bc8 59. Rc7 Ba6 {I think I'm lost here no matter what, but I'm not sure I even saw the rook fork.} 60. Rc6+ Ke7 61. Rxa6 Kf7 62. Kxg4 {Overall, I was pretty much lost after the sequence that started with move 8 and ended with me being down a rook and a pawn on move 13.  A combination of tactical miscalculation and of being greedy for my extra pawn.}
