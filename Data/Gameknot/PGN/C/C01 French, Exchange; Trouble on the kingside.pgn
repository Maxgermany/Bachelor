1. e4 {Sometimes it's the minor things that set up the attack. In this French Defense mini-tournament game white uses a rather passive move (7.h3) to block black's attack against his dark square bishop. Black later takes aim at exactly that square. Let's see where this leads.} e6 2. d4 d5 {Last move of the initial position of the mini-tournament.} 3. exd5 {White decides to go for the exchange.} exd5 4. c3 Bd6 5. Bd3 {Both parties make preparations for a kingside castle.} Nc6 {Waiting to see where white's dark square bishop goes before moving the king's knight.} 6. Be3 Nf6 7. h3 {One of black's plans would be to eliminate the e3 bishop with Ng4. This move is in response to that threat. However a direct 7.Nf3 is better. The line 7.Nf3 Ng4 8.0-0 Nxe3 9.Re1 with recapture poses no problems for white.} O-O 8. Nf3 Re8 9. O-O Bd7 {Putting a knight in the center with 9...Ne4 is probably better for black, but since he has a plan in mind...} 10. Nbd2 Qc8 {A short maneuver to target h3.} 11. Nh2 {?; better is 11.Qc2 for a simmilar battery.} Bxh3 {The whole point.} 12. gxh3 {White's best chance would be to count the pawn as a loss and concentrate elsewhere. This just opens up the kingside for black's pieces.} Qxh3 13. Ndf3 {Nh-f3 is better but white still faces problems.} Ng4 {Going on with the plan. However a simpler win is available with the direct 13...Re4. [Fritz]} 14. Nxg4 Qxg4+ 15. Kh1 Qh3+ {Not wanting to give white a chance to bring his f-rook into play. Notice how passive white's rooks and queen are.} 16. Kg1 {How to continue now?  White guards lots of squares on the g and h files and it seems like a rook lift won't help.} Re6 {Still...} 17. b3 {Not helping with the situation, but then again, no move really could.} Kh8 {!; Making room for the other black rook. Of course Fritz insists that 17...Rf6 is a better move. Heh, what does he know?} 18. Re1 Rh6 {The natural continuation of the plan. A rook sacrifices itself for its sister's glory.} 19. Bxh6 {Nothing better since black threatens mate at h1.} gxh6 {Et voil√†! What seemed impossible a couple of moves ago - getting a rook with check on the g-file - came to happen.} 20. Re3 {20.Bxh7 would have prevented the onslaught for a while but it would only have pleased Fritz. The point is black's.} Rg8+ {Mate in 7.} 21. Ng5 {White foregoes the useless 21.Bg6.} Rxg5+ 22. Rg3 Bxg3 23. fxg3 Rxg3+ 24. Kf2 Rg2+ 25. Ke1 Qe3+ 26. Be2 Rg1# {The end. White's queen and queenside rook were literally out of the game, while the light square bishop - moved once in the opening - only moved again before the final accord.}
