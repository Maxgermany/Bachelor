1. Nf3 {I used to play nf3 with (2)b3 to good effect many years ago in the wirral league, so thought i would give it a go against Charleshiggie} d5 {so the fight for the centre begins...} 2. b3 {bet he wasn't expecting this? ..on with the plan } Bg4 {this move was never played against me in all my many years in the league playing this system! however running this game via the chess engines and the top level computers play this very move!!} 3. Bb2 {naturally i want to own e5 even by blocking in my own dark bishop} Nd7 {again the choice of the silicone...so my opponents 2 and 3rd move are very popular with computers ...} 4. d4 {holding e5 } e6 {i was expecting Bxf3 here? } 5. e3 {releasing the white bishop and preparing to castle} Ngf6 {eyeing e4} 6. Nbd2 {holding e4 and preparing c4} Bd6 {develop and castle} 7. Be2 {removing the annoying pin and now looking at e5} c6 {c6...here i was expecting c5! } 8. O-O {king safe...} O-O {ditto} 9. h3 {not the best of moves, perhaps c4 is better?} Bh5 {keeps his white bishop for now...} 10. a3 {very passive } Re8 {perhaps this move is to retreat the black bishop after my c file advance, or to strike at the centre with e5? ..} 11. Ne5 {cannot allow the e5 push....and looking at playing f4 } Bxe2 {great! one less defender to worry about } 12. Qxe2 {naturally } c5 {c5 is played a little too late in my humble opinion } 13. c4 {c4 feels natural } b6 {was not expecting this move at all..i thought Rc8?} 14. f4 {reinforcing the centre } Qc7 {now development is complete and his rooks are connected.....} 15. Rac1 {a very natural and useful move ...} Re7 {so this surely is to double up rooks on the e file and smash the centre? } 16. Qf3 {prophylaxis and putting my lady to a safer place} Qb7 {ditto } 17. cxd5 {here we go !! } exd5 {even so far? } 18. g4 {brash move but hey ho...} Ne4 {ooohh thank you .} 19. Nxe4 {chomp!} dxe4 {now my g4 move doesnt look so bad..} 20. Qg2 {slightly better now for me i thinks} cxd4 {really? wow and now the c file looks alive!} 21. Nc6 {and suddenly the game takes on a different dimension } Ree8 {natural} 22. Nxd4 {regaining the material but also eyeing f5} Nc5 {good move ...but...} 23. Nf5 {intermezzo time } Bf8 {solid defensive move } 24. Be5 {risky move this and could easily backfire.. } Nd3 {what about the c7 square Cahrlie? } 25. Rc7 {plus to white } Qb8 {what?? ...now come on how many of you would play this move? ..however the chessking computer programme chooses this move in post match analysis, so again Charles is showing his superior playing ability..} 26. Qc2 {eyeing c4! } Nxe5 {natural move } 27. fxe5 {takes back...} Bc5 {was not expecting this at all} 28. Rxf7 {this move had me buzzing all over! } Qxe5 {king doesn't take the bait, and instead queen takes my little worthless pawn? im now confused as i did not consider this very strange move by my opponent..but again this move is played by the computer in post match?!! } 29. Qc4 {the only worthy move as not to embarrass my rook on f7..and with a discovered to boot! } Kh8 {removing the threat ..} 30. b4 {kicking the bishop into ?} Bf8 {...a better square} 31. Rf4 {now im a bit dispirited and certain this move does nothing much ..other than retreating my knight to g3 and pressuring the e4 pawn. } Rac8 {ooopss....now its time to concede and realize my opponent has equalized } 32. Qd4 {wimped out and a draw agreed......still a very entertaining game. }
