[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {My opponent start with the standard Queens pawn opening.    } Nf6 {Among so many popular response i picked Ng6. I was not a regular player of this opening though} 2. e3 {He advances e3 pawn that clears his LSB path and add a good defender to d4. (what's the name of this variation??)} g6 {I continued with my plan and Bg7 in next move for castling and sending my king to safe zone.} 3. Nf3 {He also continue with the castling in mind i think.} Bg7 {According to plan} 4. Nc3 {Nc3 prevent my f6 knight to come at e4 as i was planned. So, i hold castling and decided to add a defender for e4 square with pawn advancement to d5 which may passivate my Bishop at g7. Please suggest the best possible move at this point } d5 {I ignored blockage of my bishop movement at g7.} 5. h3 {The standard move to prevent my LSB to pin his knight at f3. It seems me a over protective move though} Nc6 {This move is for supporting my next move of LSB at f5 and targeted his c2 pawn if there is any weakness he offers. } 6. a3 {But he guessed my plan and prevent any advancement of Nc3 to b4 for targeting c2 pawn. } O-O {So i stick to my plan and castle. Please suggest the timing of castling is right or not ?? as  opponent may have chance of pawn storm towards king side and exploit it to lead a winging situation. } 7. Bd3 {He finally develop his LSB to best available square d3 and further stop my plan of Ne5. So far he has no weakness to attack} h6 {this move is for vacating h7 square for f6 Knight so that i activate my Bishop at g7 to some extent atleast.  } 8. g4 {I was most afraid (psychologically) of king side pawn storm as i loose many game by this. He sacrifice his king safety at the cost of a strong pawn advancement as it seems. Post game computer analysis at chess-dotcom suggest this is a inaccuracy though, with a slight advantage of  0.65 in favor of black. Dear reader please share your view} Nh7 {I was with my plan and also this seems me a reasonable move in this type of attack to king side} 9. Nh2 {and his most awkward move for me. I think he tried to clear the path for f - pawn for a strong attack to my king side.} e5 {So i think this is best response of Nh2. Also open queen path through diagonal upto h4} 10. dxe5 {As expected he accept pawn exchange.} Bxe5 {I take back pawn with Bishop keeping in mind to take his knight at h2. Although Chess-dotcom computer analysis prefer to take with knight and give a big advantage of 1.56 in favor of black.} 11. Nf3 {So he avoid his knight exchange with bishop at h2 and also force my bishop at e5 to retreat.} f5 {I thought this is best move in this situation.} 12. Be2 {It seems to me another illogical move as it passivate LSB more at e2 than active at d3.} Bxc3+ {This is also a bad exchange for me as it exchange a active bishop with a rather passive knight but i want to doubled white c pawn} 13. bxc3 {He take back} Ne7 {Chess-dotcom given it an inaccuracy with slight advantage of 0.40 in favor of white but it seems me a one of best move since it add extra defender in d5 and f5 pawn also clear c7 path as i was determine to make c7-c5 in next move. } 14. Nd4 {he take the central position but chess-dotcom prefer Bb2} c5 {And this is why computer predict Nd4 is an inaccuracy. I forced knight to treat.  } 15. Nb3 {as i was aiming to my bishop at b7 so i did not force his knight by further advancement of my c pawn because then15. ......N(c5-c4)  16. Nd4 b6 17. Bf3 Bb7 18. Ne6 Qc8 or Qe8 19. Nxf8 Qxf8 and white has a upper hand} b6 {So i continue with safe side and push my pawn to defend c5.} 16. Bf3 {He anyway try to attack my weak d5 pawn . Chess-dotcom analysis give it an inaccuracy and suggest a better move was c4} Ng5 {So i try to exchange his active bishop with my Knight} 17. Bg2 {He avoid this exchange and gone to a much safer and active place at g2 as it now start defending h3 also} Ne4 {So i attack his c3 pawn and at the same time block His LSB path. Although chessdotcom again give it and inaccuracy and suggest Qd6 is a better move } 18. Bxe4 {Force to take} fxe4 {I take back with f pawn and clear f- file for rook movement} 19. Bb2 {Surprisingly chessdotcom suggest it a best move but for me it seems illogical to hide bishop and a wastage of time....} Nc6 {Mistake ??? as Chess-dotcom analysis suggest. Chessdotcom suggest a better move was Qe8} 20. Qe2 {He clear the path for castling but chessdotcom give it a mistake and suggest c4.} Qh4 {So i try to take a pawn if he castle } 21. O-O-O {Castling is a best move he thought } Qxf2 {This is a mistake suggested by chessdotcom . The best move in this situation as suggested by computer is Be6. Dear reader please suggest what is better move in this situation. } 22. Qd2 {Its also a mistake } Qxd2+ {So i thought its better to exchange queen with one pawn up situation and i was already prepared next few forced move for white. } 23. Nxd2 {He takes back with knight } Ba6 {Chessdot com like Bc8 to Ba6 } 24. Nb3 {I think it was again a big mistake by white and wastage of momentum as he try to take my d- pawn with his rook and open the d file but he is fully overlooked my planing. At this stage chessdotcom favors black position with 2.28 score} Bc4 {i threat his knight and try to weaken his king side  } 25. Nd2 {So he made another best move to force me to retreat me back but i have some another plan } Be2 {Force to move from d-fie} 26. Rde1 {He force me to retreat my bishop} Bf3 {I interlock the f file and force his another rook to move a rather close g file} 27. Rhg1 {he save his rook} g5 {I advance g6 to g5 to avoid g file opening as my king on the same file} 28. c4 {So after so many moves he makes one of waiting c4} dxc4 {I accept the exchange } 29. Nxc4 {He takes back} Rad8 {and i move my rook to open d file} 30. Bc3 {logical move since he knows what coming next} b5 {I hit his knight and he has a4 square to move his knight but } 31. Nd2 {but i don't know why he retreat his knight back at d2} a5 {So i advanced a7 to a5 for hitting his bishop also } 32. Nb3 {Oh no he still unaware of advancing pawn strength and try to take my c4 pawn in which he never succeed  } b4 {hitting Bishop } 33. axb4 {He takes} axb4 {I take back } 34. Bb2 {He forced to move his bishop to a safe place} c4 {Hello Knight how are you} 35. Nd2 {back to hut. Oh buddy chess dotcom have a better move for you Nd4} c3 {Hello both } 36. Nxf3 {he takes } exf3 {i takes } 37. Ref1 {Chessdotcom consider it an inaccuracy} cxb2+ {So i taste a free bishop } 38. Kxb2 {He takes back } Rd2 {I already up +3 material advantage so try to finish it fast with series of exchange } 39. Kc1 {King to first rank to avoid and weakness also force me to move my rook } Re2 {So i move to a safer place } 40. Rg3 {He try to exchange rook with a pawn advantage but } Rxe3 {i deny any such exchange } 41. Kd2 {White king try to hit my rook } Re2+ {So i save and deny any  escape path for king} 42. Kd1 {King is back to their hut } Nd4 {Chess-dotcom consider it an inaccuracy and  suggest best move as Rd8 with check } 43. h4 {And he offer exchange to distract me with my plan. h4 is a mistake by chessdotcom and tells a mate in five move. According to computer analysis the best move to avoid mating sequence is Rxf3} Rxc2 {So i capture another pawn} 44. hxg5 {He takes } hxg5 {i taken back} 45. Rh3 {he take the open h file } Ra2 {oh i missed a mate. chessdotcom told after Ra8 the next move is mate} 46. Rfh1 {he double his rook} f2 {i was thinking to convert advancing pawn into queen. How fool i am?} 47. Rh3h8+ {He  try last chance but thats not enough} Kf7 48. Rh8h2 {He back } Ke8 {and any hope is now vanished. Thanks for reading. Comments and improvement suggestion is always welcome. Please Rate me in star system and tell me how i did in this game.} 49. Kc1 f1=Q+ 50. Rxf1 Rxf1# {}
