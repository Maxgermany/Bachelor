1. e4 c5 {I usually play Caro-Kann - c7-c6, but for this game, decided to experiment...} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. c3 a6 5. Ba4 {White normally exchanges the bishop, the retreat allows black to expand on the queenside with tempo... } b5 6. Bb3 Nf6 7. d3 g6 8. Bf4 Bg7 9. O-O O-O 10. a4 {Interesting move. Probably the only one that claims some sort of advantage, but with careful play, black maintains equality. } Bb7 11. Ng5 e5 {Interestingly, e6 is bad because of 12. B:e6 fe 13. N:e6 and white gets two pawns and a rook for two light pieces. } 12. Bg3 h6 13. Bxf7+ {Wrong. White gives up material. At the same time, I must admit that when picking up the bishop, I did not see, that white could get a pawn on b5 after the exchange of pawns and a check from b3 with a queen... :)} Rxf7 14. Nxf7 Kxf7 15. axb5 axb5 16. Rxa8 {Here, I had a choice. If I took with a queen, I had ideas of penetrating the white queenside. However, this is where I saw the check from b3 and decided to keep the queen close to the center. } Bxa8 17. f4 {Good move, opening  a line for the rook. } exf4 18. Bxf4 {Here, c5-c4 was an option, but with an open line for the rook, and no mood for calculations... :) I decided to hide the king and give up a pawn... } Kg8 19. Qb3+ Kh7 20. Qe6 {Wow! Totally unexpected. This is when I started taking the game seriously. I was expecting Nd2 (which, as game shows later was necessary...) but with such a drastic centralisation of the white queen, I suddenly have few squares to defend. After long (20 minutes or so) deliberations, I decided to play Ne5. Interesting sequence would be 20...Ne5 21. B:e5 de 22. Q:e5 and here N:e4, seemingly a nice move comes across simple 23. Rf7. Hmmm, interesting...} Ne5 21. Bxe5 dxe5 22. Qf7 {Now this is interesting. Second time when I sat down and calculated different options after ambitious (and as it turned out after calculations - winning) 22. Q:d3. Decision taken. } Qxd3 23. Rxf6 Qxe4 {Boom and double threat of checkmate on g2 and hanging knight on b1 decides the game. C'est tout!} 24. Qxg6+ Qxg6 {}
