1. e4 {My traditional opening.} e5 2. Nf3 Bc5 {? Not a move I ever encountered before. His pawn is wide open.} 3. Nxe5 Qf6 4. Ng4 d5 {Me and mikesons had completed a couple other games earlier on this day and were playing quite fast. I can usually play fast and not make major mistakes. Black, however, well you look at the board, he completely overlooked my knight! He did tell me, "That's what happens when you play too fast."} 5. Nxf6+ Nxf6 6. exd5 {A massive advantage for me right now.} Nxd5 7. Qe2+ Be6 8. Qb5+ {My advantage was massive, but I was about to make it even bigger!} c6 9. Qxb7 {The rook is gone.} Nb4 {I could see his next move coming. 10. Qxa8 Nxc2+ 11. Kd1 Nxa1. I wasn't gonna let that happen.} 10. Bd3 {The bishop protects the c2 pawn and the c2 pawn protects the bishop.} O-O {He gives the b8 Knight protection.} 11. Qxa8 {We all knew that was gonna happen.} Re8 {I was unsure what he was planning.} 12. Qb7 {I wanted to get my queen out of there.} Bc8+ {Completely overlooked that. All of a sudden, black is able to reduce my advantage big time!} 13. Be2 Bxb7 {I still have a good advantage though. I did tell you this would get interesting right?} 14. O-O Nxc2 {And it has. I overlooked that completely too.} 15. d3 {I had no idea what to do.} Rxe2 {Yet another overlooked attack. Just a few moves ago I had a massive advantage. Now I'm about to have a big disadvantage!} 16. Rd1 Nxa1 {He never gave up, and now look at where black is. Once this had happened, I had basically given up myself.} 17. d4 {I decided to go for this: 17. d4 Bxd4 18. Rxd4 Re1# and give him the win...} Bb4 {...but he instead protected his bishop. He may not of seen the possibilities of checkmate, or he was going easy on me, but then I noticed that both our kings had the same flawed protection, thus I decided to go for one final push!} 18. Bd2 {Wasn't sure what to do really, but I hoped for 18. Bd2 Bxd2 19. Rxd2 Rxd2 20. Nxd2. That would of hurt me though...} Nc2 {...so I'm very glad he did this instead!} 19. Bxb4 {I trade here. I tend to do better with less pieces on the field.} Nxb4 20. Nc3 {I go for the rook.} Ba6 {? Either we are still playing to fast for him to handle, or he is going too easy on me!} 21. Nxe2 Bxe2 22. Re1 {I go for an even Steven.} Bc4 {It wasn't until he made this move when I realized how incredible this game was all the way to...} 23. Re8# {THE END! As I said, "Flawed protection!" This game is the perfect example of "It ain't over until it's over!" Think about this: I get a massive early lead, black comes back and not only erases it but builds a big lead himself, but then I find a way to turn things around and bring in checkmate. This incredible, awesome, and exciting game was now over. I hope you enjoyed this annotation and feel free to comment and rate it.}
