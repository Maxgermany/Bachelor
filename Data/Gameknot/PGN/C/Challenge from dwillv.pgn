[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed"]

1. e4 {The normal opening move for a fairly aggressive player.  Usually results in a sharp, competitive beginning.} c5 2. Nc3 b6 {Not the usual line in the silican.} 3. Bc4 {Developing pieces is the most important part in the opening.} e6 {? Pretty useless.  If he wanted the f-bishop to develop, why not e5?} 4. Nf3 Bb7 5. d3 {Extra protection for the e-pawn, so the c-knight can move better.  Also allows the black squared bishop to develop.} d5 6. exd5 exd5 7. Qe2+ {In hindsight, this wasn't the best move.} Ne7 8. Bb3 d4 {? If you attack a piece, make sure it can't move anywhere that would hurt your position...} 9. Nb5 {...like this} g6 10. Bf4 Ba6 {Na6 was better} 11. Nc7+ {!! Fork} Kd7 {Only good move he had} 12. Nxa8 {obviously} Bb7 {knight is trapped, but it doesn't matter.} 13. Bc7 {Attacking the queen} Qc8 14. Ne5+ {Checkmate in 1 move} Ke8 15. Bxf7# {checkmate}
