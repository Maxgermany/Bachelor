1. e4 {Again, I am annotating from a game hiredgun112 played - please take your time to observe and comment.} e5 {Normal.} 2. Qh5 {An early queen move.} Bb4 {Overlooking Qxe5+ then Qxg7/ } 3. Qxe5+ Ne7 {Fails to Qxg7. } 4. Qxg7 Rf8 {I prefer Rg8. } 5. Qxh7 {I think that Black is actually more developed, despite losing three pawns - don't you?} Nbc6 {Developing.} 6. Nf3 {Same for white.} d6 {Opening up the diagonal.} 7. Bc4 {Eyeing f7. } Bg4 {Attacking the knight.} 8. Ng5 {Here we have Bxf7+ winning the pawn.} Qd7 {Overlooking Bxf7+.} 9. Bxf7+ Rxf7 {What about Ke8. } 10. Qxf7+ {The queen is immune due to the knight on g5. } Kd8 {The only square.} 11. Qg7 {Preparing Nf7+ followed by Qh8+ winning the rook.} a5 {Overlooking Nf7+.} 12. Nf7+ {As I said.} Ke8 {The only move, falling to the skewer.} 13. Nh6 {What about Qh8+?} Qe6 {Again, overlooking Qh8+.  EDIT: (27/12/14) This actually threatens mate - not 14. Qh8+? Kd7 15. Qxa8 Qxe4+ 26. Kf1 Qe2+ 27. Kg2 Qe1# and that is mate.} 14. Qh8+ {Winning the rook.  EDIT: (27/12/14) A blunder. } Kd7 {The best move.} 15. Qxa8 {Is white better, eleven points ahead, or is black winning? We have here 15. ... Qxe4+ 16. Kf1 Qe2+ 17. Kg1 Qe1# - so black is winning. } Qxe4+ {1. } 16. Kf1 {Mate in two.} Be2+ {No! - wrong move, the best to be Qe2+, following mate. This loses the game (probably). } 17. Kg1 {Ke1 fails to mate from 17. Ke1 Bd3+ 18. Kd1 Qe2#.} Bd1 18. h3 {Preventing mate by Qe1 which should have happened before.} Nf5 {Trading.} 19. Kh2 {Blunder - loses the knight.} Qf4+ {Check. The best move is actually Kg1 not the obvious 20. g3?? which fails to } 20. g3 {...} Qxf2# {Qxf2# - wonderful checkmate - so the moral is, greedily grabbing pieces and pawns may not win the game for you. Well played both sides - @oodle3.}
