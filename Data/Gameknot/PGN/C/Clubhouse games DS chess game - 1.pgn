1. d4 f5 {We start off with a Dutch...} 2. Nf3 {...this move wasn't in the GK opening database. Main line was 2 c4, with some alternatives and this was not one of them. I responded with...} d5 3. Qd3 {3 Qd3. There are times when bringing the queen out early is good, and the DS decided this was one of them.} Nc6 {Threat of 4 ... Nb4 scaring the queen.} 4. Ne5 {If black takes, 4 ... Nxe5 5 Nxe5, so...} Nb4 {...I went to b4 anyway, and queen moved to...} 5. Qb5+ {...b5! Next series of moves would drive queen away.} c6 6. Qxb4 e6 7. Qxf8+ Kxf8 {...and I have traded my DSB, a knight, and castling rights for white's queen.} 8. Bd2 c5 9. dxc5 d4 10. Bb4 Nf6 11. c6+ {Discovered check, winning the b pawn...} Kg8 12. cxb7 Bxb7 {...which I retake with my LSB, connecting queen and rook which could be of use later.} 13. Nf3 {Aiming at g5.} h5 {13 ... h6 might have been preferred here.} 14. Ng5 a5 {Aiming for white's DSB...} 15. Nxe6 {...and white has a similar idea, going after my queen.} Qd5 {I move the queen out of harm's way, centralizing her at the same time.} 16. Nf8 axb4 {Now I take the bishop.} 17. Ng6 d3 18. Ne7+ Kh7 19. Nxd5 {I give up the queen to connect rooks. White's rooks weren't active at all (they haven't even moved once!) but mine become very active.} Bxd5 {First I take that knight out of the picture.} 20. c4 Bxc4 21. Na3 Ba6 {Why not go all the way back to a6?} 22. Nc4 Bxc4 23. Rc1 Rhe8 {While white is eying the c file, I am focused on doubling my rooks on the e file.} 24. Rxc4 dxe2 {A pawn sacrifice that readies the doubling of rooks.} 25. Bxe2 Re5 {And now I start to double my rooks.} 26. Rc2 Rae8 27. f4 b3 {Threatening rook trade...} 28. axb3 {...which white declines.} Re5e4 29. h3 g5 30. Rc7+ {King can march ahead now, even he would be needed for the mating net.} Kg6 31. Rc2 gxf4 32. g3 fxg3 {This move equalizes material, but as the game progresses, knight tends to be stronger than bishop here, especially since the bishop is pinned by the rooks!} 33. Rd2 Nd5 34. O-O {White still had castling rights the whole time, only now does the castling take place, just to add another defender to e2 next move.} Re4xe2 {I decided to offer the trade anyway...} 35. Rxd5 {...and, of course, white accepted. But now I have a response in...} Rh2 36. Rd6+ {Again, taunting my king to march forward.} Kg5 37. Rd8 {37 Rd8??? Finally the CPU buckles under my pressure.} Rxd8 38. h4+ Kxh4 39. Rf4+ Kg5 40. Rf1 Rf8 41. Re1 f4 42. Re5+ Kh4 43. Re4 Rf5 44. Re8 Rb5 45. Rd8 Rxb3 46. Ra8 Rbxb2 47. Rd8 {Now I had the game in the bag.} Rb1+ 48. Rd1 Rxd1# {}
