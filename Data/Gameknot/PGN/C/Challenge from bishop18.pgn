1. d4 {This game was very interesting, as I (bishop18) went up and down throughout it, and then went up again for the win. kldr is, as of August 2008, the highest rated player I have beaten here on GameKnot.} Nf6 {Indian Defense.} 2. h3 {Now, this is an extremely onorthodox response to the Indian Defense. The purpose here was to force me (black) to reveal my plan earlier. This could also be an attempt to stay away from the main line of the Indian, which is good for black.} e6 3. Nf3 b6 {I adopted the standard Queen's Indian structure. Both my bishops now have lines.} 4. Bf4 Bb7 5. e3 d6 6. c4 c5 {Launching an all-out attack on white's central pawns. This is my own strategy in the Indian (I have never seen it used by anyone else).} 7. Nc3 cxd4 8. Nxd4 {This was a mistake. Better would have been 8. exd4. I then would have played 8. ... d5.} e5 {That is why it was a mistake. When you play, you need to be aware of forks like that one, and avoid them.} 9. Bg5 exd4 10. exd4 {White has control of the center, and has isolated my d-pawn, but I am up in material.} Be7 {Removing the pin.} 11. Be2 h6 {I could have played 11. ... Bxg2, but that would open up the g-file for white's rook, and let the rook have high attack potential on the kingside, where I will castle.} 12. Bh4 Nbd7 {Develops the knight in a way that supports the other knight and does not block my light bishop.} 13. O-O Rc8 {Taking the half-open file.} 14. b3 O-O 15. Re1 Re8 16. Bd3 Qc7 {Moving the queen out to start an attack.} 17. Bc2 {The idea is to move the white queen to d3 and have a strong battery aimed at my king.} Qc6 {Threatens Qxg2#} 18. d5 {Prevents mate.} Qc5 19. a3 Ne5 {Moving my knight into the action.} 20. Ne4 Qc7 21. Nxf6+ Bxf6 22. Bxf6 gxf6 {Weakening my kingside safety. I admit I made a mistake not seeing that play. Moving my knight onto a solid square on e5 has its disadvantages. Every move accomplishes something, but leaves something behind. You need to watch that.} 23. Re3 {Threatening Rg3 } Ng6 {Improving my king's safety by blocking the g-file and the line of white's light bishop.} 24. Rg3 Kg7 {Supporting the knight and kingside pawns.} 25. Bxg6 fxg6 26. Qd3 Re5 {An awful mistake. Better was f5; that way I wouldn't have lost my kingside pawns. However, this was the start of my successful attack.} 27. Qxg6+ Kh8 28. Qxh6+ Qh7 {Blocking the check.} 29. Qxh7+ {Better was Qxf6 } Kxh7 {Material was even again. White lacked a bishop and I lacked 3 pawns. I do not have a good record against such a mdistribution of material.} 30. Rd1 Rce8 {I now have total control of the e-file, which I used as a penetration point.} 31. Rf3 Kg7 32. Rg3+ Kf7 {The g-file is closed to white's rook, and the isolated f-pawn is protected.} 33. Rd4 Re5e1+ 34. Kh2 Ra1 35. Rgg4 Ree1 {Now my rooks are on the first rank, and one is threatening to take the a-pawn.} 36. Rgh4 {The g-file did not work for kldr, so he tries the h-file instead.} Kg7 37. a4 Rab1 {Attacking the b-pawn.} 38. Rd3 {Defending the b-pawn.} Bc8 {Taking my bishop out of its useless place and putting it on a good diagonal aimed at the white king.} 39. f4 Bf5 {If the pawn got to f5, white would have good outposts, and my king would not be able to get out into the action in an endgame.} 40. Rg3+ Bg6 41. f5 {41. f5???? A terrible blunder! By moving the rook to g3, white blocked the king's only flight square in the case of Rh1 . } Reh1# {Checkmate.}
