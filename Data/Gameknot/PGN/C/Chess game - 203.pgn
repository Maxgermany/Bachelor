1. e4 e5 2. f4 {I reeeally like the King's Gambit. I'm in looove with it.} d6 {Declining the King's Gambit. Unfortunately I've found this to be a little bit of a weak opening, because it doesn't seem to do much. It'd be good for beginners though, who don't know that much about this gambit.} 3. Nf3 Bg4 {This was interesting. I'd much rather play 3. ... exf4 if I was him, but this is interesting too.} 4. Bc4 {I just decide to keep developing my pieces, aiming at f7.} h6 {(?!) I think he's scared of 5. Bxf7+ Kxf7 6. Ng5 ... 7. Qxg4. But I would have thought 4. ... Nf6 significantly repels this by protecting Bg4 and developing at the same time, and also threatening e4.} 5. fxe5 {I set up this threat my own way.} dxe5 {But only because I've seen it before.} 6. Bxf7+ {(!)} Ke7 {Black doesn't want to capture at f7. Fair call.} 7. Nc3 {Maybe 7. Bxg8 Rxg8 8. 0-0 would have been more effective, neutralising the Ng8.} Nf6 8. Bd5 {(?) Just a waste of time.} c6 {And Black gains a tempo.} 9. Bb3 Na6 {I would have rather done 9. ... Nbd7, but this is OK.} 10. h3 Bxf3 {Black prevents the possibly dangerous Nxe5.} 11. Qxf3 Nc5 {And virtually neutralises the Bb3 from its penetrating diagonal of a2-g8. Bye bye bishop.} 12. d3 Nxb3 13. axb3 {Now my Ra1 has a nice open file.} Kd7 {(?) I wasn't sure what he was trying to do with this.} 14. Qf5+ Kc7 15. Qxe5+ Bd6 {And now my Queen is in danger. I have to put it to use somehow. Meanwhile I'm thinking up threats of Nb5+ and Nd5+. Nothing yet.} 16. Qa5+ b6 17. Qa6 {My Queen doesn't have much space. I'm quite convinced he could have gone ... b5 at some point, but that might have made c6 weak.} Nd7 {Securing his king.} 18. Nd5+ {I decide to sacrifice my knight, because, I mean what the heck, if I'm gonna have a chance of winning, I'm going to have to take risks.} cxd5 19. exd5 {Securing control of that elusive square c6. But hopefully for long enough.} Bg3+ 20. Kd1 {I retreat to d1, avoiding any malicious check combinations.} Re8 21. Ra4 {Preparing to maneouvre my rook to c4.} Qe7 22. Rc4+ Nc5 {I thought he was threatening mate with 22. ... Qe1+ 23. Rxe1 Rxe1+, but then I realised 24. Kd2 and there's not much in the form of threats there. This is why I took preventative measures.} 23. Bd2 {Preventative measures.} Kd6 24. Rxc5 {(!?) A genius trap, but with a flaw. Black can play 24. ... Qe2+ 25. Kc1 Kxc5 26. Qc4+ Kd6 27. Qc6+ Ke5 28. Bc3+ Kf4 29. Qd6+ Kf5 30. Qxg3, and White is a pawn up. (Note: This is my analysis, not some computer, so it's likely to be full of errors, but bear with me. Thanks. Oh, and this is also a blitz game, so it's unlikely that he would have spotted this rather than be allured by the prospect of gaining the advantage.} Kxc5 {(??)} 25. Bb4+ {(!!) Skewering the King and the Queen, if the King moves. And if he captures...} Kxb4 26. Qc4+ Ka5 27. Qa4# {Thanks for watching my game... hope you enjoyed it... I'm about a rook down at this time and it's one of the games I'm more proud of... I'm yet to annotate a game where I make a horrendous mistake and lose my queen or something, which would be a welcome first. Then you can all laugh at me and call me a beginner. But for now,  Thank you for watching and have a good week. Live long, do good, be wise, search for truth. Peace, everybody!}
