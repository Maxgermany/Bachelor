[Opening "Vienna (C26), Falkbeer variation"]

1. e4 e5 {Nothing new.} 2. Nc3 {As good as 2.Nf3, this is the Vienna game.} Nf6 {I'm pretty sure that this is an opening, but it transposes.} 3. Nf3 Nc6 {You may think that this is boring, but you're probably wrong. "One man's junk is another man's treasure," as they say.} 4. Bc4 {This is where the magic begins, where everyone wants an easy point.} Nxe4 {A huge error! If you don't believe me, then scroll below to find out why.} 5. Bxf7+ {This does two things. #1. It keeps me equal and #2, even better, the King has to take it.} Kxf7 {Free path to the Knight on e4 and prepares for a winning line.} 6. Nxe4 d5 {Here, the line goes: 7.Nfg5+ (the idea is to keep going with the attack) 7...Ke8 (or Ke7 8.Qf3! dxe4 9.Qf7+ Kd6 (forced) 10.Nxe4#) 8.Qf3!. This wins for White even if 7...Kg8.} 7. Ng3 {Unfortunately, I make this move and the game is roughly equal.} Bg4 {Pins the Knight to the Queen.} 8. O-O {I try castling Kingside, a rather wise decision.} e4 {Black is trying to torment my Knight, but even worse, prying open my Kingside.} 9. h3 {All right, lets see what I get out of this exchange.} exf3 {Obviously.} 10. hxg4 {Without going for the pawn, I safely take the Bishop with the h-pawn. Here, I thought that the Bishop would take my Knight via 9...Bxf3.} fxg2 {Before I take the pawn, I feel the requirement of bringing out the Queen...} 11. Qf3+ {This isn't the best idea, but it isn't the worst.} Kg8 {There's a problem now. That Black d-pawn is indirectly pinned to checkmate.} 12. Kxg2 {I take with the King. I didn't want to lose my Queen's momentum on the third rank.} Ne5 {This is really for nuisance; Black should really focus on King safety instead.} 13. Qf4 {If I have to get off of the third rank to protect a pawn, I would.} Ng6 {If my Queen is so tempting, why not put it on e3?} 14. Qe3 {This threatens mate on the next turn. Black would have to check me or just put her Queen on f6.} d4 {I think the mate did not feel like it was there because I wasn't plaaning on doing it, but I found it anyway. I felt like it should be done with tremendous punishment.} 15. Qb3+ {This isn't the mate in 1, but it counts as a mate in two. I just wanted to take one more piece.} Qd5+ {The only move. The next is checkmate.} 16. Qxd5# {Sometimes, you have to admit that a move/tactic is bad, even if you don't feel like admitting it. Whatever you do, don't try the tactic on move 4, even if you are playing it as White, because it becomes a nasty position to terminate unless you're opponent makes a mistake. Do not count on trying to get everything, it only makes a position harder to deal with and once again, look out for any possible move that you're opponent can make because some of those moves can be used as tactics.}
