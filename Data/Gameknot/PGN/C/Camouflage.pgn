1. e4 {Hi everyone, here I get into a reasonable position in the endgame and with a draw in sight guess what - I go and blow it again.  It has to be said that a skillful bit of camouflage on Freddy's part was a contributory factor in my blundering in this game.  I kick off with e4.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {2. ........ d6 - the Philidor's Defence, Freddy decides to back up his e pawn with a pawn.  Freddy plays into a line where an early queen trade ensues.} 3. d4 Nc6 4. dxe5 {4. dxe5 - the start of the trade.} Nxe5 5. Nxe5 dxe5 6. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {6........ Kxd8 - the queens have been traded - Looking at this position it seems hard to believe that I end up getting Freddied yet again!} 7. Bc4 f6 8. Be3 {8. Be3 - development.} Bd6 9. Nc3 c6 10. O-O-O {10. 0-0-0 - as it looks as though we are nearing an endgame I feel queenside castling instead of kingside castling is better.} Kc7 11. a3 f5 12. exf5 {12. exf5 - I decide to take on f5 in order to give Freddy an isolani.} Bxf5 13. f3 Nf6 14. Bd3 {14. Bd3 - challenging the b1-h7 diagonal.  This precipitates an exchange of light square bishops.} Bxd3 15. Rxd3 Rhd8 16. Bg5 {16. Bg5 - I decide to pin Freddy's knight to his rook.} Bc5 17. Rxd8 Rxd8 {17. ......  Rxd8 - now 1 pair of rooks is exchanged.} 18. Ne4 Be7 {18. ..... Be7 - Freddy breaks the pin.} 19. Rd1 Rxd1+ 20. Kxd1 {20. Kxd1 - the remaining rooks are exchanged and now it is an endgame - after just 20 moves.} a5 21. Nxf6 gxf6 22. Bh4 {22. Bh4 - keeping the f6 pawn pinned to Freddy's dsb.  I bring Henry out to e2 next move.} a4 23. Ke2 Kd6 24. g4 {24. g4 - to hold back f5.} b5 25. c3 Kd5 26. Kd3 c5 27. Be1 {27. Be1 - to stop the possibility of a bishop sac on b4.} c4+ 28. Ke3 {28. Ke3?? - here is the error.  Do you see the camouflage?  Freddy reveals all in the next two moves and my position unravels big time.  Freddy had this to say about what I should have played here:-  "I tell you what I would have moved if I were on your side of the board.. 28. Ke2 instead of Ke3 > this to avoid a possible check from the bishop 29. h4 instead of gxf5 > avoid double pawns and keep your pawn line connected"   } f5 29. gxf5 Bg5+ 30. Ke2 Bc1 31. Kd1 {31. Kd1 - Freddy had this to say about my king move:- "What about 31. Bd2 and try to exchange or lock in my bishop..." } Bxb2 32. Kc2 Bxa3 33. Kb1 {33. Kb1? - and Freddy had this to say about my move to b1. "I would have moved 33. f6 or Bh4" } Be7 34. Bd2 e4 35. fxe4+ {35. fxe4+? - would f5 have been an improvement?} Kxe4 36. Be1 Kxf5 37. Bg3 Bf6 38. Kc2 {38. Kc2 - the only way to hold on to the c pawn.  Freddy surprises me with b4.} b4 39. cxb4 a3 40. Kb1 c3 41. b5 a2+ {41. ..... a2+ and # in 4.  Notice that this is a decoy.  Henry must capture but the c pawn now crowns.} 42. Kxa2 c2 {42. ....... c2 - #3} 43. b6 c1=Q {43. ...... c1/Q - #2} 44. b7 Qb2# {44. ...... Qb2 CHECKMATE.  A sad end.}
