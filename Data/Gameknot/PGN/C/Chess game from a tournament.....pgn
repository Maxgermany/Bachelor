1. e4 {In this game i was playing someone rated a lot higher than me in a club match. I like to try out this opening occasionally as it's surprising how many people actually take before they look. I win around 50% of games when I play this one. This is one of my all time favourites (it's also my first time annotating!)} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 {I Like doing this, for some reason it confuses people....} exf4 {Greedy, Greedy, } 4. e5 {Didn't see that coming did they? The knight now has nowhere to go....} Ng8 {... except home} 5. Nf3 {Move five and Blacks only appear to have moved one piece} Be7 {Hoping to recover with a nasty looking check} 6. Bc4 {Setting up a square to run, i mean strategically move to.} Bh4+ {What a surprise} 7. Kf1 Nc6 8. d4 {I like that pawn where it is, thank you} Qe7 9. Bxf4 b6 10. Nd5 {And this is where it really starts falling apart!} Qd8 11. Nxh4 Qxh4 12. c3 Qd8 13. Qf3 Nge7 14. Bg5 f6 15. exf6 Rf8 16. f7+ Rxf7 {My opponent looked so happy when he made this move. Mate in three though} 17. Nxc7+ Qxc7 18. Qxf7+ Kd8 19. Qf8# {The moral of this game?  Don't be greedy!!}
