1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. Qg4 {This move took 10 mins as he was looking to pick up that free pawn} Nf6 {So I let him have it for "free"} 4. Qf3 {He didn't like the free pawn due to the bishop sac on F2 (4. Qxg7 Bxf2 5. Kxf2 Rg8 6. Qh6 Ng4!)} d6 5. h3 Be6 6. Na4 Nbd7 7. c4 c6 8. Nc3 {I was happy here as I was ahead on development and wanted to chase his only two active pieces} Bd4 9. Bd3 {At this stage I should have doubled his pawns and brought the knight to c5 maybe?} O-O 10. Nge2 Bxc3 11. Nxc3 a6 {Preparing to push queenside } 12. b3 b5 13. O-O Nc5 14. Re1 b4 15. Ne2 Qc7 {Maybe d5 would have opened up things better.....} 16. Ng3 Rad8 17. Bc2 h6 {In anticipation of d3} 18. d3 Nh7 {Almost 20 moves in and still no captures, so I needed space} 19. Be3 Nd7 20. Bd2 {This looked like alot of messing} a5 21. Nf5 {Now I was worried about a sac on h6} Bxf5 22. Qxf5 Nc5 23. Qf3 Ne6 24. Qg3 Kh8 25. Be3 Qe7 26. Rad1 Rfg8 27. Ref1 c5 28. f4 {I didn't want to clear the path for the white bishop to h7 so I threatened the K,Q fork  } Nd4 29. Bxd4 cxd4 30. fxe5 dxe5 31. Rd2 f6 32. Rdf2 Ng5 33. Qg4 Qd7 {I saw that Niall had won so I thought offered a draw here in this now very stagnant game....} 34. Bd1 {Which my opponent refused as he probably fancied having his bishop on d5 at some stage} Qe7 35. Qh5 {We're both close to 10 mins each here...} Kh7 36. Qh4 Rd6 37. Qg4 Rf8 38. Qe2 {Now it's time wasting moves..} Ne6 39. g3 Ng5 40. Kh2 Qe6 41. Qg4 Qe7 {We both had 4 minutes left and he took the open draw offer knowing that it meant the team lost but he wasn't confident of getting anything out of it.}
