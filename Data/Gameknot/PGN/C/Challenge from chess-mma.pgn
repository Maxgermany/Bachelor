1. e4 {was a game I played against one of my best friends and it started like a regular game by me. I love to start with e4 since that it the most simple move that opens up 2 pieces and give you control of the center } Nc6 {as he went out with Nc6 its a opening I am not used too so I won't lie I used the Gameknot database to see which move fits best and what my choices are.} 2. Nf3 {and that is yet a simple response and I wasn't even sure that it was the best move.  } Nf6 {ok now he places his second knight on the best place on the board for it. and I need to protect my pawn} 3. e5 {so since he didn't move out his pawn yet I decided that it will be good to advance and keep it safe at the same time and getting into his territory is never a bad thing right? } Ng4 {ok I am trying to think how will he benefit from it?} 4. d4 {lets get more support and open up the black bishop and control more of the center!} d6 5. h3 Nh6 6.
