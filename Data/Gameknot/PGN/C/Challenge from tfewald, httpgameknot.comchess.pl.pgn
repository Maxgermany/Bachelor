[Opening "French (C16), Winawer, advance variation"]

1. e4 e6 {The French } 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Winawer.  Just starting to learn this. } 4. e5 Ne7 {GM Simon Williams recommends this move in his videos, "Killer French". It's less popular than c5, though. Looking through the game now, though, that I never even moved my c-pawn; hardly a normal French. } 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 O-O {Castling is generally good, but I don't think I was ready for it. I needed to develop more pieces first, as well as play get the C pawn out. } 7. Bd3 f5 {Serious blunder, blithely carrying out my plans without watching what my opponent is doing. Ng6 would have been better defensively. } 8. exf6 e.p. Rxf6 9. Qh5 g6 {Ng6 might have been better, but it allowed Bg5! pinning the R to the Q. Looks to me like it's already over. I don't have a good defense. My entire queen side hasn't budged except the d pawn. } 10. Qg5 Qf8 {The only move, but my Q is seriously overworked, protecting the N, R, and h6. All momentum is with my opponent. } 11. h4 Nbc6 {Desperately trying to bring in some help. Nd7 leaves the N no where to go. } 12. h5 Nd8 13. hxg6 Nxg6 14. Qh5 Qg7 {Very bad. Qf7 was better. Ended up there anyway, but gave the opponent an extra tempo this way. } 15. Bh6 Qf7 16. Bg5 Nf4 17. Bxh7+ Kf8 18. Qxf7+ Kxf7 19. Nf3 Ng6 20. Bxg6+ Kxg6 21. Rh6+ {}
