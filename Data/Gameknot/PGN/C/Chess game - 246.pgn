[Opening "Caro-Kann (B10), Hillbilly attack"]

1. e4 {The most common starting move, but when a game starts this way, one expects it to get interesting quickly.  This game does not disappoint.} c6 {"The Caro-Kann Defense may be compared to the Slav Defense against the Queen's Pawn:  It strives for defense of the strong-point at d5 and development of the Queen's Bishop" (Chessmaster).  In the many games I have played against him, I do not play this move often.  I wanted to see what his reaction would be, though I had an idea that he'd play Bc4.} 2. Bc4 {"B10 Caro-Kann Defense / Hillbilly Attack. An awful second move by White which will cause White to lose time when Black attacks the Bishop with gain of space by 2...d5 3.exd5 cxd5. There are a few games using this line where Black failed to win, but through no fault of White's" (Chessmaster).  Yes, you read right, the program called my brother a hillbilly.  I saw this move a mile away and was ready with 2...d5.  99.9 percent of the time, he starts with 1. e4 followed by 2. Bc4.} d5 {Gotta love a pawn fork on the second move.} 3. Bb3 {He is wasting time protecting his bishop, as stated in the annotation of move 2.} e6 4. e5 Bb4 5. c3 {Attacking my bishop, trying to regain that tempo.} Bc5 {Moving it to a5 would have resulted in the loss of one less tempo than this, but it would have put the bishop into a corner.  However, after 6. d4, it gets cornered anyway or moved back to e7.  Either way, white gains some time.} 6. d4 Bb6 7. Bg5 {Threatening my queen, but I see that this attack has no support, and the bishop is hanging.  A better way of attacking the queen would be to play 7.Nf3 and follow that with 8.Bg5 so that the bishop has some support.  In addition, Nf3 develops a piece and opens up castling lines.} Qxg5 {At first I did not see that the bishop was hanging.  When I did, this was obvious.  He has a target now, but it's not only a moving target but also one that bites back.} 8. Nf3 Qxg2 9. Rg1 {Trying to keep his crosshairs on the queen, but this will lead to some losses.} Qh3 10. Ng5 Qf5 {Leaving the pawn alone, but the knight is stuck in the queen's orbit.} 11. Nd2 {Best to leave the knight there and bring in support.  However, even better is Bc2, which would force the black queen to f4.} h6 {Further attacking the knight, but considerably weakens the g6 square for me.} 12. Ngf3 {Moves the knight out of immediate danger.  Despite the material deficit, white is better.  His rook is aiming at the weak g7 pawn and his knights are controlling central squares, while the only black piece that is active is the queen.  The pawn structure is severely hindering black's development.} Bc7 13. Nh4 {Once again attacking the queen.  White has focused many of his forces on the queen.} Qf4 {Forking the knight and pawn.} 14. Rg4 {Threatening the black queen.  I think that Ng6 was better because it takes advantage of the weakness on g6 to fork the queen and rook, leading to fxg6 Rxg6, and though white loses a knight for two pawns, damages black's pawn structure and makes it very difficult for him to develop.} Qxh2 {Wins another pawn, making blacks h-pawn a passed pawn.} 15. Ba4 {Pins the c6 pawn, whose movement would have made black's development a lot easier.} b5 {Attacking the bishop, unpinning the c6 pawn, and making it a bit easier to develop.} 16. Ndf3 {Encases the black queen.  The black queen's demise is now inevitable.} Qh1+ {The black queen's curtain call.  White's going to lose something, but black's queen is done save for Ng1, which effectively loses a knight and effectively wins the queen ("effectively" meaning that they are still on the board).} 17. Ke2 {Not losing that control of the half open g-file and keeping his pieces active, white decides to use a queen exchange for the black queen's send off.  Losing the rook is the better option; the queen or the other rook can control the g-file later.} Qxd1+ {The black queen makes her exit after taking 14 points worth of white's material (including the queen).} 18. Kxd1 {The king was the worst choice to take the black queen.  White could have activated another piece by taking with the Rook, or avoided further loss of material by taking with the bishop.} bxa4 19. Rxg7 {Taking the weak g7 pawn, and placing the rook on the damaging 7th rank.  Now we start to see black develop, mainly because he is forced to.  His only active piece is gone, and he needs to get some space back.} Ne7 {Ne7 starts to rebuild black's development while moving his knight out of immediate danger.  However, I could have played a3, sacrificing a pawn to get my dark squared bishop in play.  It's a toss-up which is better, but I think that I made the right move.} 20. b3 {White wants to exchange pawns on b3 in order to open up the a-file and add another dimension to black's spatial issues.  Usually when cramped, it is a good idea to exchange, but here an exchange would be terrible for black.  If I leave that pawn, white plays bxa4, opening the b-file.} a3 {I play a3, blocking the a2 pawn and leaving the rook in that corner, locked in by his own pieces.} 21. b4 {Locks my dark squared bishop in that corner.} Bb6 {Another option was to play a5 and open up some options.  I could also have played Ba6 to get my bad bishop in the center, but I move my good bishop to b6 with the idea of c5.} 22. Rb1 Nf5 {An exchange of knights would open the game up and give black an edge by increasing the value of his bishops.} 23. Nxf5 exf5 {With this knight exchange, we start to see white's spatial advantage slip away.} 24. e6 {Forcing me to do something about it.} Bxe6 {I take the pawn with my bishop because taking with the pawn would undo what I did by exchanging knights.} 25. Ne5 {Looking to go after my f7 pawn.  I do not understand his motives, but then again, I never understood my younger brother.  It seems he is trying to compensate for his material disadvantage by attacking my backside doubled isolated pawn.  The better one to eliminate would be the frontside one, but that is considerably more difficult to do.} h5 {Pushes the passed pawn.  The rook's right behind it, and the road ahead looks clear.  There's potential threats, but I'm not worried about those now.} 26. Kc2 {Takes control of the all important promotion square.} h4 {That threat does not faze the pawn.  If this threat is what it looks like, it's not all that much to worry about, just a bigger material gap for white.} 27. Nf3 {Now the 7th rank is controlled in addition.} h3 {That's the "Energizer Bunny" pawn: it just keeps going and going and going and going..............} 28. Rbg1 {Creates a battery of his rooks on the g-file.  They look ready to break into black's camp.} h2 {That pawn sure has balls.  Won't stop until it dies.  Hey, no guts, no glory.} 29. Nxh2 Rxh2 {Exchange bolsters my material advantage.} 30. Rg7g8+ Ke7 31. Re1 {Pinning the bishop.  With the pawns there, it's not moving anyway.} Rxf2+ {Suddenly white is in a deep hole.} 32. Kb3 {Attacking my a3 pawn, which only serves to block his a2 pawn which isn't going to do much anyway.} Rb2+ {I must have been high when I did this.  I just blew a tempo.  That pawn was done anyway.} 33. Kxa3 {And now I have to move my rook.} Rc2 34. Rh8 f4 {Now this pawn's going.  Also, I have a line open for my bishop, though that does a lot of good when it can't move anyway. <sarcasm off>} 35. Rh6 {A further attack on the pinned bishop, but it's not in too much trouble.} Kd7 {Removes the pin on black's light square bishop, but there is little it can do, as all of white's pieces are on dark squares.  I should have just keep going with the pawn simply because this bishop has noting going for it.} 36. Kb3 {Forcing me to move my rook again, but now I know where I want it.} Rg2 {This rook has had its fun wreaking havoc on white's camp.  Now it just hangs back and prepares to protect the f4 pawn.} 37. Rh7 {Pinning my f7 pawn, though it's not likely to do much where it is anyway.  It's the back of two doubled pawns, which is one of the weakest types of pawns out there, even with the advanced position of the other f-pawn.} Ke7 {Wasted another move, and put the pin back on my bishop.  Better was Rg6, going with my original plan of putting the rook behind the passed pawn, or f3, advancing the pawn.} 38. Rf1 {Attacking the unsupported pawn.} Bc7 {Taking advantage of the backdoor exit while helping to support my passed pawn.  This is only a temporary solution until I can get my rook there.} 39. a4 Bh3 {Threatening a discovered attack on his rook.  However, immediately after I played this I used an obscenity because I realized that that bishop was hanging.  Big mistake.  Lucky my opponent didn't hear that.  Much better is Rg6 to be followed by Rf6, protecting that pawn.  Here, I just blunder away a bishop for no good reason.} 40. Re1+ {White makes a big mistake in failing to take advantage of black's big mistake.  Now the bishop can go back to its previous square, where it was protected, although pinned.} Be6 41. Rf1 {And we are right back to where we started from; the exact same position.  I'm not going to move Bh3 again for a number of reasons: 1) I do NOT make the same mistake twice, much less in one game.  If I do, I get really PO'd.  2) As stated in the time I did make that mistake, that bishop is hanging.  3) If I make that move and get the same reply, this game is drawn.  Believing that I was in fact better here, I decided to change the position up.} Rg5 {I should have moved it to g6, leaving the line for the bishop open.} 42. a5 Rg6 {Two moves in what should have taken one.  I should have just moved Rf5 and then started pushing that pawn up.  This is why Rg5 the previous move was a mistake.  I either waste a move or close the line for my bishop.} 43. c4 {White is moving his pawns up the board, but there's a black tribe up ahead that wants to hold them back.} Rf6 {At last, the rook is behind the pawn.  Now the pawn can march, and it's about time.} 44. cxd5 Bxd5+ {Bishop to pawn: "Hold up a second, I got some issues with a certain white peon (pawn) which I have to deal with."  And deal with it he does, delivering check while he's at it.} 45. Kc3 {Bringing the king toward the action.  White has a lot of ground to make up; this is a start.} Bg2 {Between Bg2 and f3, it's a toss up.  The bishop move kicks the rook off of the promotion square, but leaves the pawn there and allows white to move d5.  The pawn move is obviously pushing the passed pawn, but closing the bishop off from attacking the white rook.} 46. Re1+ Kd6 {Moving my king toward the center as well, but leaving the e-file open.  That hardly matters because the promotion is going to happen on the f-file (unless the rook stays there, in which case he leaves as the pawn promotes).} 47. Kc4 {Cornering black's king, but white still has a long way to go to be even close to mating.  Things look bad for black on the surface, but a little bit of deeper analysis shows that white is the one who needs to worry.  If you do not see the complete position of the board, then a move like this would get into your head.  For instance, there is almost no way that white can take advantage of the fact that the black king can only move to one square if he's going to move.  Desperation moves like this really only attempt to affect one psychologically in the manner described.} f3 48. d5 {White's trying to get something going on.  I do not know what, nor do I really care.} f2 {Adds a promote threat at f2, and now white has to give up on the e-file, open black's game up, and see what he can do from there.} 49. b5 cxd5+ {Now that's just mean!  He's already down, so why prolong the agony?  This move does really nothing; much better is fxe1=Q.} 50. Kd3 Bxa5 {Further attacking the already hanging rook.  Why does it need to be attacked any more than it already is?  I got too excited that I started showboating.  This is never good because white is trying to get his game back on track.  No matter how big an advantage, it can always be thrown away.  I was not thinking about this during the game, and made some mistakes because of it.} 51. Rh6 {Big mistake, losing any chance of winning this game.} Rxh6 {Grabbing his rook with no hesitation.  Should have been thinking about that pawn there.  Even so, grabbing the rook destroys white.} 52. Re6+ Rxe6 {And white's goose is cooked.  Aside from avoiding stalemate, the rest is just a formality.} 53. b6 f1=Q+ {Finally promoting that pawn, and it's about time.} 54. Kc2 Qe2+ 55. Kb3 Re3+ 56. Ka4 Nc6 {The white king cannot move, but the pawn can!  I am so glad that it was there.} 57. bxa7 Qa2+ {Sorry, wrong answer.  The correct answer was Qc4 and checkmate.  } 58. Kb5 {forced.} Qb3+ {White resigned at this point.  Truth be told, I think this game should have ended sooner (I threw away the mating move, and he is not going to promote that pawn at all.)  Had this game continued, it would go a bit like: 59. Ka6 (forced) Qb6#, or Rxa7#, adding insult to injury.}
