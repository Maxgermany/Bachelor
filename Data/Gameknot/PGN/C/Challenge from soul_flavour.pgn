1. e4 {here we go - i always have problems which paolo & this opening!} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {develpoed as normal} d6 {not sure if this was a good move - blocking the dark squared bishop but i knew he'd take the knight then attack d5 pawn so.. figured instead of bringing queen out it would be a better bet} 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 {as predicted now i have the dreaded double pawn} 5. c4 {stopping d5 and leveling out my pawns} c5 6. d3 {facing off} Bg4 {pinning knight} 7. h3 {seeing how if id take the offer} Bh5 {i dont as by taking the knight would just be taken back by his queen aiding in his development and slowing mine down even more} 8. Nbd2 {knight supports knight giving queen chance to go on walk about and leavng no chance of doubled pawns if the exchange was taken on} Nf6 9. b3 {a stone wall is started to be created here} Be7 {black bishop has nowhere to go as was bloked in ealier did consider g6 but wanted to castle and dont like that formation infront of king } 10. Bb2 O-O {finally get king safe and minor pieces developed} 11. a3 Qd7 {bring out the queen and look at some kind of queenside attack - still unsure of any real plan} 12. Bc3 a5 13. O-O {gets his king out of the center - access is hard for black on the king side } h6 {create a furtue luft and stop any advancement of f3 knight} 14. Qb1 {queensside is looking where the action may take place} a4 {offering the exchange} 15. b4 {pawn is passed} cxb4 {take the chance to free the doubled pawn} 16. axb4 {gives black a passed pawn!!} Rfb8 17. Rc1 c5 {the exchange cant be honered } 18. b5 {again pawn is passed} Bd8 {looking for options to attack - dark squared bishop is uless to me so looking to exchange as his has potential to be active} 19. Qc2 {pressure on my a4 pawn} Ba5 {looking to exchange} 20. Bxa5 {knew i couldnt go into the combination with out coming out a pawn down - but took it on anyway to free up future attacks} Rxa5 21. Rxa4 Rxa4 22. Qxa4 Qc8 23. Qc2 Ra8 {looking to hit the flanks and get more exchanges} 24. Rb1 {guarding his passed pawn} Ra7 25. Nh4 {he now focuses on kingside attarck} Qa8 {i build up on queenside - hoping i can hit him quick enough to halt his kingside attack and retreat his advancing knight} 26. Nf5 Ra1 27. Rxa1 Qxa1+ {the exchange but my queen is now on the back ranks :)} 28. Qb1 {swap the ladies??} Qc3 {no thanks i need her to cause mischief - if i did no doubt the kings side attack would carry on from where it was left a couple of moves ago} 29. Nb3 Be2 {saw an opening to attack the base of his pawn structure} 30. Nc1 {he sees away to defend it} Bd1 {was a safe & cheeky place to rest } 31. Ne3 {attacking knight comes back to defend} Qe1+ {is the only way out to save bishop and give myself a little breathing space} 32. Kh2 Qxf2 {regain my lost pawn} 33. Ng4 {blacks big mistake - suppose he was too focus to attack queen but f5 or even b2 would of been a better option} Bxg4 {bishop eats up the pressie} 34. Qa2 {swap the ladies agin - is tempting but } Qf4+ {but when you spy a fork!!} 35. g3 Qxc1 {trade is accepted } 36. hxg4 Nxg4+ {but i get the pawn and an anoying check } 37. Kh3 {attacks the knight} h5 {support} 38. Kh4 g6 {more support & advancing my pawns} 39. b6 {running for freedom} f6 {if the running pawn continues h1 = m8} 40.

Kg2 {was willing to sac knight & queen for queen here if i could get a good postion - this wasnt it} Qb2+ 46.

Qxf1 Qxf1+ 51. Kxf1 g5 {my king is closer to the middle i plan to over power him with pawn mass & my active king} 52.
