[Opening "Caro-Kann (B13), exchange, Rubinstein variation"]

1. e4 c6 {As noted earlier, he agrees to the Caro Kann.} 2. d4 {Now, as we know, whether it's the French Defense or Caro Kann, in general, when your opponent by only advancing his or her pawn one square, then 2.d4 is generally the best response, as you open up lines for attack.} d5 {The idea behind this move is to exchange, and that's about to happen.} 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 {So, I decide to continue developing, by bringing my N out.  However, is this the best move?  Not sure because I learned something important, which is why I enjoy studying the Caro Kann.  In it, my opponent said, "4.c4 the Panov Botvinnik leads to an open attacking game which may suit your style."} Nf6 {And, I said, What's interesting is that there's a lot to learn with the Carro Kann. For example, I did not know about the Panov Botvinnik variation.  His response was, "Chess proverb.Chess is a sea in which a gnat can drink and an elephant bathe.  The more you learn the more you realise how little you know."} 5. Bb5+ {So, I said, and, that's a good thing because the more you know, the better you become. Afterall, I still need to learn more about the Caro Kann, I decide to play what I'm comfortable with, at this point, because I've been told that there's nothing really wrong with doing that.  It's just that you have to be careful because the opponent can get an advantage if he finds an opportunity to gain tempii.  But, what I kept in mind is that since this move puts him in check, there's no way that he can do that.  And, by doing this, I thought that I gained tempii, instead.  And, we are going into variations that I'm predicting, but I was wrong about one thing, it doesn't lose tempo for black, either.} Bd7 {As anticipated.  And, as you're about to witness, this move is going to lead to an exchange of B's, which I also predicted.  } 6. Bxd7+ Nbxd7 {In the middle of it, Wolfgang, my coach for this game said, "How would you assess this position? I feel black has at least equalised having had his weakest minor piece exchanged off.  Obviously Nbxd7 not Qxd7 due to Ne5"} 7. O-O {This was my intention, all along.  But, in response to his last comment, now knowing what the weak V B really is.  And, as it turns out, Mr. Stockel is dead on.  Strong bishop, in general, is the color.  Meaning, that if you're white, then the LSB is the strong piece.  If, however, you're black, then the DSB is the strong piece.  So, I said,  That's not good. I've always had trouble determining what minor piece is weak or strong. That still remains one of my weak areas, in chess. For example, I thought that I just took your strong bishop.  In addition, the idea was for you to take, so that I could castle.  This is what I had planned for two moves, so since 5.Bb5!.} e6 {So, then I asked, you understand why I took. The plan was to place you in check, force an exchange, and then castle. Now, little did I realize that what I took was a weak piece. But, I have trouble knowing how to tell from a weak V. a strong minor piece. I realize that this is something for me work on, in terms of, being able to determine that.} 8. Bg5 {And, he said, "Would you agree that black has equalised? If so can you think of an alternative strategy white could use starting at move 4?After thinking about it then consult GK database to compare ideas.  The reason why chess has endured the centuries is that its not only a game.Its a sport ,it has artistic elements and like science it can be studied. So the road to improvement needs study as well as practice."} Be7 {Having said that the idea behind this move was for wolfgang to get another piece out.  By doing so, he can and will castle on his next move. } 9. Nc3 {Meanwhile, my idea is to complete development and this move does that.  My goal, however, is to bring the final piece into play, my Q.  And, that will happen right after he castles.} O-O 10. Qd3 h6 {I only understand the logic behind this too well.  The idea being to chase the B back, or force an exchange.  But, given the context clues, I believe that a B is worth more then a N.  Therefore, I'm not going to take, but rather retreat on the most common outpost for this kind of position.} 11. Bh4 a6 {?! I don't know why he played this.  Afterall, it's not the Sicilian Defense, and I only see this move with that defense.  I mean, probably to prevent my N from reaching b4.  But, because of that I decided to mark this move as dubious because there's no need to worry about it.  This time, it's not a threat, and my intention was not to play 12.Nb5.} 12. Ne5 {This, however, was my intention.  Given that f6 is his weak N, we now know that d7, as it turns out, is his strong N.  So, my goal is to exchange by getting rid of his strong N by exchanging, and then some.   Which is about to happen.  Therefore, I now feel that, this time, white has just equalized and with best play, might even have a slight edge.} Nxe5 13. dxe5 Nd7 {This is why.  After playing 13.dxe5, black was just forced to retreat which is how I just gained tempii.  And, I am going to use that needed time to force another exchange.} 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Qd4 {So, this move proves that I have a plan.  As we will see shortly, it's the same plan that black has, ironically.  } Rac8 {It starts with this move because he's organizing his R's.} 16. Rad1 {But, so do I.} Rc4 {This move, however, accomplishes his long term goals.  What is it?  We will find out soon.  But, to sort of give you a hint.  This move gains black tempii which is absolutely needed.  And, with it, black now has the edge.} 17. Qe3 Rfc8 {He accurately said, "gaining time to double rooks on c file" which is what he's done.  My goal was the same, but these rooks prove to be dangerous.  } 18. Rd4 {As, I told wolfgang, my goal was the same.  But, had I played, 18.Rd3, with the idea being that I'd be able to double on with Rd1, those rooks can do a lot of damage, such as mate.  I mean, that's exactly how I lost against Jack Stockel despite being a Q ahead.  But, there's more to this then meets the eye, and I'm in trouble.  In it he said, "In it, he said, "White has 2 weak squares which black is targeting. c2 and e5.General plan doble rooks c file. Push b pawn to soften up Q-side look for opportunity if presents to play Re4 and win e5 pawn."  And, after telling him what I thought, that I got the advantage back by gaining tempii, he accurately pointed out, "whites Q-side is still under pressure"} Qb4 {His goal is to put pressure on the fourth rank, but I am not about to be pressured in anyway.  So, I immediately exchange rooks.} 19. Rxc4 Rxc4 20. Rb1 {My b pawn needs protection.  20.b3?? is not an option, as it would lose a piece, without any compensation.  20...Qxc3 21.Qxc3 (forced), Rxc3.} d4 {So, black takes advantage of my weakness by forking my N and Q.} 21. a3 {However, this move illustrates that sometimes a fork will not achieve your goals, so it's not a good idea to just go for forking moves, as cdeburca once told me.  The idea behind this is that if he takes with 21...dxe3, I'll recapture with 22.axb4, and everything is even.  But, as we know, there's always more to a story then meets the eye.} Qc5 {I don't know why he played.  I thought that he would accept the exchange, instead.  So, I don't what that decision accomplishes.  But, this time, I'm not marking it as pointless because I realize later on, that no matter what he did this for a very good reason.  And, this choice is going to cause a lot of damage for white, in some way.} 22. Qd3 {?? Since my Q is now attacked, I had to retreat in some way.  However, this move is the losing blunder because it loses a pawn and a piece.  Plus it gives black that needed time to set up, "a successful mating corridor", as jstevens1 puts it.   Therefore, best was 22.Qe3.} Nxe5 23. Qd2 {Since I'm attacked, I had to retreat again.  But, this diagram proves that tempii is actually critical.  And, no matter how you slice it, black wins a free piece, when we are done exchanging.} dxc3 24. bxc3 Rxc3 25. Rxb7 Rxc2 26. Qd8+ {So, knowing that, I play this.  And, I actually miscalculated.  Like with Jack Stockel, when I was a R and two pawns behind.  To make matters worse, he was very close to promoting a pawn.  However, he took another pawn, which is what sealed his fate as it enabled me to pull a swindle.  I thought the same thing happened, in that black underestimated white, and that this move was a mate in one.  What, I forgot, however, is that he moved his h pawn, so instead of this being a mate, he can and does escape with 26...Kh7.} Kh7 27. g3 {Now, I have to be careful, or he will get the back rank mate on me.  What I am unaware of, however, is that the damage has already been done.  And, black has a won game with no way around it, this time.} Qxf2+ {This is why.  After this, black has an automatic mate with now way out of it.  28.Kh2 (forced), Qh2#.  Knowing this, I resigned.  }
