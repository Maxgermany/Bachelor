1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {I'm more accustomed to playing Bb5  in this position.  But Bc4 seems good.   a2-g8 is a strong diagonal. } a6 4. O-O d6 5. d3 Bg4 6. h3 {I don't like the Bishop pinning  my Knight down on f3.  So with  h3 I attempt to drive it away.} Bh5 7. g4 {The bishop is still pinning my Knight,  so I try again to drive it away.  This move seriously weakened my kingside, though I didn't see it  at the time. A better way to  relieve the pin would have been to move the queen off the diagonal.} Bxg4 8. hxg4 {Black decided to take the pawn, give up his Bishop in the process, and rip open White's kingside defenses.  I take the bait. Now White is up 2 points in material, but the h-file is open to  attack and the g pawn is isolated  and week.  The f pawn is also  isolated from other pawns, though  protected for now by the Rook and  the King.   Playing as White, I began to feel  like this game was coming apart  already and was not quite sure  how I got into this mess. (note  to self: you got into this mess by playing 7. g4)} h6 9. Be3 {Developing my Bishop, just  on general principles.  Now  it commands two diagonals.   Also clearing out my home  rank with the object of  connecting the rooks as  soon as possible.  } Be7 10. Nc3 {I see that Black's Bishop and  Queen are aiming at h4, threatening mayhem.  Not seeing any defense, I Continue my development  and aim a second piece at d5, which I hope to seize.} Bg5 11. Re1 {Black's bishop attacks White's bishop on e3, which is defended only by the f pawn.   I don't want want to use the  fpawn in Bishop defense because if  I do then I'll have doubled pawns on  the e file and no chance of ever relieving  the isolation of the pawn on g4. So I defend the Bishop with my rook.} Bxe3 {Black initiates the trade.   Losing his Bishop may not be  such a bad idea for Black, since  it is "bad" (i.e. has limited  mobility beause it is on the same  color square as most of Black's  pawns.)} 12. Rxe3 {I take the Bishop and begin  to assert myself on the e-file.    I'm feeling better about my  position, but still haven't dealt  with the vulnerability of my kingside,  partiularly the h file.} Nd4 13. Nxd4 {I accept Black's offer of a Knight-swap.   Considering that I'm ahead in material,  even swaps of pieces tend to favor me.   Also, in this case I have given my rook  more scope for movement on rank 3.} exd4 14. Re1 {Black's pawn on d4 was attacking both the rook on e3 and the Knight on c3.    By moving the rook out of harm's  way I lose the Knight, and Black  loses only the pawn, but I will open  up the b file for my rook or my Queen.  My moves at this point seem reaonable,  but the initiative is clearly Black's.  I am  mainly responding to Black's threats,  rather than advancing any plans of my  own.} dxc3 15. bxc3 {I lose the exchange, so material is now even, but I have gained an open b-file.} Qg5 {This move gives me a queasy feeling that I'm going to lose the game.  My g pawn is hanging out there without protection, and my King looks very vulnerable.  I consider protecting the g pawn by moving my f pawn to f3, which would also add strength to e4.  But that would cut off the scope of my Queen and reduce my chances of developing a counter attack.  } 16. Qf3 {So I move my Queen instead. The Queen on f3 protects the g pawn for now and also has potential to dominate the a8-h1 diagonal when and if the time is ripe.} Nf6 {Of course, the folly of protecting a pawn with a Queen is that if there's a double attack on the pawn you can end up losing your Queen.  Now Black brings out the Knight to threaten the g pawn also.  If Nxg4 I can hardly respond with Qxg4 because that will lose my Queen.  On the other hand, however, I can respond by using either  my c4 bishop or my Queen to take black's pawn on f7 and deliver check.  Whichever one I use will be protected by the other.  I'm glad now that I developed that Bishop to c4 when I had a chance, even though I had no specific plans for it.} 17. d4 {I've been obsessing inwardly about the fate of the g4 pawn, but there seems to be nothing to do about it unless or until Black strikes, so I turn my attention to the center.  By pushing the d pawn I hope to prepare the way for e5, attacking the Knight and attempting to fully open the e file to my rook.} O-O-O 18. Bxf7 {With the King no longer protecting f7  after Black castles, I grab the pawn.} h5 19. e5 {If 19...hxg4, my King will be in great danger. I can think of no particular defense against this, however, so I proceed with the idea of taking e5.  This also finally opens up the a8-h1 diagonal so that my Queen can live up to her potential.} hxg4 20. Qg2 {As feared, Black grabs g4.  If  Black were allowed to play g4xf3 I'd not only lose the Queen but would be in check.  In that case my only legal move would be Kf1, and it seems likely I  would be mated within just a few  moves. To avoid all this, I move the Queen.  also giving some protectionto my  King.   But my heart is sinking.   Is this game lost?} Nh5 {Black moves his Knight to avoid  capture by the e5 pawn.  But h5  is not a good square for the Knight,  and at least temporarily the power  of the h8 rook is blunted as well.   I see some light at the end of the tunnel.} 21. Rab1 {Way back at move 15 I had opened  the b file by moving using the b pawn  to capture on c3.  Now, I finally take  control of the b-file by moving my  Rook into place.} c6 22. Be6+ {I give check and also add a little protection to g4.} Kb8 23. d5 {When in doubt I advance my pawns  toward the opposite rank.  if 23 ... cxd5 then   24 Bxd5, and the c file would be a little more  open to me, as would the a8-h1 diagonal.} Nf4 24. Qe4 {Black renews the attack on my Queen and moves closer to delivering checkmate against my King. I move the Queen, but keep it on the same  diagonal, hoping against hope for more  attacking chances on that diagonal.} Qh4 {My panicky feeling here was that Black  threatened to mate me at Qh2.  I now  see that there was actually an escape  route for my King at f1 and that mate  was not as imminent as I thought.   Nevertheless, in this case fear was a  good motivator.  } 25. Rxb7+ {No reasonable defense against the perceived mate threat occurs to me.   In desparation, I decide that the only  hope is to begin a relentless counter- attack.  I want to keep Black in check  continuously until I can either deliver  checkmate or remove some of the Black  pieces that threaten my King.   I deliver check and give up my rook.   Not really seeing a clear path to victory,  I nevertheless commit myself to keep  on checking as long as I can. Without this motivating fear, who knows how long I would have waited to attack?} Kxb7 26. dxc6+ {Now I'm glad that I had placed a pawn on d5.  I had thought it might come in handy.  Also glad that my Queen is on that diagonal, backing it up. } Kc7 27. exd6+ {The checks keep coming.  } Kxd6 28. Qb4+ Kxc6 {Black takes my pawn, preventing  it from moving closer to promotion.   But does he know that my only  "plan" right now is to keep on  checking?  } 29. Qe4+ Kd6 {This feels like a gift.  I can now take Black's Knight AND deliver another check  at the same time.  The Knight has  prevented my King from even thinking  about a flight to e2 to get away from check,  so now I hope that I may be able to  survive even if the opportunities  to give check run out.} 30. Qxf4+ Kc6 31. Qc4+ Kb7 {Now I can crowd the King over to the a-file} 32. Rb1+ {The Black King has nowhere to go but a7 or a8} Ka7 33. Qc7+ {The only place left for the Black King is a8.   If he goes there, I will follow up with  34. Qb7 mate.   Black neither moves nor resigns,  but lets the clock run out.   White wins.}
