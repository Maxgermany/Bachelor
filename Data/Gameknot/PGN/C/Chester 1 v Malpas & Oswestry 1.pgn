1. d4 {This was a very painful loss. I've played this young man a few times before, but this was the first time for over a year. A couple of my previous games with him I have annotated, http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/revenge?gm=56196 http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/chester7vpenyffordd2wirral-league?gm=49458 } f5 {This was the first surprise. In previous games he had defended with the King's Indian Defence.} 2. g3 {The usual reply to the Dutch Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Defence#White_continuations} g6 {Look a bit like he wants to head into a King's Indian formation where f7-f5 has already be played.} 3. c4 {This is also a common move for white at some stage, against the Dutch Defence.} Bg7 {Black completes his fianchetto.} 4. Nc3 {I want to play e2-e4.} Nf6 {he stops it - at least for now.} 5. Bg2 {I threaten e2-e4 again.} d6 {Another common move for black in this variation.} 6. e4 {So I play it.} O-O {He castles.} 7. Nge2 {Not Nf6?? of course, breaking the protection of the pawn on e4 with my bishop. Now my plan is to play 0-0 and e4-e5, if he lets me.} c6 {Another reasonable move, blunting my Bg2 a little, so instance if I take on f5 he can take back with his Bc8 which he couldn't before.} 8. O-O {So I continue with my plan.} Qe8 {I can't see this move in my databases, and I think it is a mistake to allow e4-e5, although in my databases I have come across two games where black allows e4-e5. The Gameknot game frodan (1760) vs. peacemaker (1704) continued with 8....Bc8-d7 and white continued with 9. f4 and then black played fxe4. This game ended in a draw. Trindade Rui Jorge Rodrigues (2063) vs. Costa Joao Guerra (2082) continued with 8....Na6 and once again white didn't advance and black eventually won. } 9. e5 {So I play it.} dxe5 {He takes.} 10. dxe5 {I take back.} Ng4 {Danny typically advances. My e pawn is now attacked twice.} 11. f4 {So I protect it. Now if his queen was on d8, he would have a nice check on b6.} Be6 {his bishop comes out.} 12. h3 {I drive back his knight.} Nh6 {Which duly retreats.} 13. b3 {And now I protect my pawn on c4 which he was attacking with his bishop.} Na6 {His knight comes out.} 14. Ba3 {I prevent it going to b4 or c5.} Rd8 {He hits my queen.} 15. Qc2 {Quite a logical square for it, especially as Nb4 is not possible.} b5 {I hadn't seen or expected this move. My first reaction was that it just lost a pawn - it took me a minute or so to realise that the queen on its rather unusual square of e8 was protecting it. I had a long think here. I considered lines such as 16.	Bxc6	Qxc6 17. cxb5 but that doesn't work as he has a queen check on b6. I looked at 16. Bxc6 Qxc6 17.	Bxe7	bxc4 but the rook and pawn I get for my two bishops is an unfavourable trade. So eventually I decided on another continuation.   } 16. cxb5 {I took.} cxb5 {He took back.} 17. Bb7 {I attack his knight.} Bc8 {I think this is the best move for him.} 18. Bd5+ {I throw in a check.} e6 {And he decides to sacrifice the exchange.} 19. Bxf8 {So I take.} Bxf8 {He takes back.} 20. Bf3 {I retreat my bishop.} Nb4 {His knight comes in.} 21. Qb1 {My queen comes back.} Nd3 {His knight comes in.} 22. Rd1 {I attack the knight.} Qd7 {He protects it again. Ok, stop, and find white's next move.} 23. Nd5 {Did you find it? This stamps out all black's counter-play. Fritz gives this position as plus 3.55 to white now.} Bc5+ {He throws in a check.} 24. Kh2 {Fritz again likes this move.} exd5 {He now takes - the threats of Nf6+ as well as the threat to his knight are too great. But which way would you recapture on d3 - with queen or rook and why?} 25. Qxd3 {Fritz prefers this - moving the queen into a nice centralised role.} Bb7 {At the time, I thought this was a mistake, allowing my next. However Fritz seems to like this move.} 26. Nd4 {Now the isolated queen's pawn is completely blockaded by the ideal blocking piece, a knight. Black has no compensation for the exchange.} g5 {Black tries to do something on the king-side.} 27. fxg5 {I just take it, although Fritz prefers 27. Qxb5 or 27. Rac1 with over plus 4 to white.} Bxd4 {Necessary, if 27.... Nf7 immediately then I have 28. e6! forking queen and knight.} 28. Qxd4 {So I take back.} Nf7 {Now he retreats the knight.} 29. h4 {and I secure the g pawn.} Qe6 {He attacks the e pawn again.} 30. Rde1 {Protecting the e pawn. Fritz is still giving me plus 4.} h6 {Still trying to do something on the king-side.} 31. g6 {I thought this was the start of a winning combination. It took Fritz quite a while to see my idea, and initially gave both gxh6 and Qxa6 as superior - but eventually change its mind and preferred my move! After 31. g6 Fritz gives it as plus 6.34 } Qxg6 {So he takes.} 32. e6 {I advance.} Nd6 {Knight moves.} 33. Bxd5 {Disaster! Fritz gives the immediate e7 as plus 6!} Ne4 {Fritz now gives 34. Qe5 as still better for white, but.....} 34. e7+ {I finally play this - a move too late!} Rxd5 {of course! } 35. Rxe4 {This was not necessary, but the advantage has now passed to black. } fxe4 {Black is just bishop for pawn up here. I could have resigned here, I played on, but I don't think there is any need for any further annotation.} 36. Qf2 Qf7 37. Rf1 Qxe7 38. Qf4 Qg7 39. Qb8+ Kh7 40. Qe8 Rd2+ 41. Kh3 Qd7+ 42. Qxd7+ Rxd7 43. Rf5 a6 44. Kg4 Re7 45. Rf2 Bc8+ 46. Kf4 Rf7+ 47. Ke3 Rxf2 48. Kxf2 Kg6 49. Ke3 Bb7 50. Kf4 h5 {Many thanks for reading. Please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
