1. e4 {The usual.} g5 {Weird.} 2. Bc4 {Old school.} e6 {Irritating.} 3. Nf3 {Meh.} Be7 {Pointless.} 4. O-O a5 {Nub.} 5. d3 {Messing with his g pawn.} c6 {If I thought he knew what he was doing, I'd be worried.} 6. Nc3 Bf6 7. e5 {Setting up more messing with the g pawn.} Be7 8. Ne4 {And more messing.} Nh6 {Right.} 9. Nfxg5 {Fun begins!} Rg8 {Fun gets funnier.} 10. Nxh7 Bh4 {Bizarre, and hilarious.} 11. Bxh6 {Yoink!} d5 12. Nef6+ {And this is where it becomes hilarious to me. Messing with him truly starts.} Ke7 13. Qh5 {Turned the rook down for comedy later.} Bxf6 14. exf6+ {Such as this.} Kd6 15. Rad1 {Trying to bait him into taking the bishop, then I take the pawn, pinning the king to the queen with the rook.} Qb6 {Idiocy or genius. Hard to tell.} 16. Be3 Rg6 {Oh no, wait, it was idiocy.} 17. Bxb6 {Yoink!} Nd7 {Meh.} 18. Ng5 {More fun to come if he takes the bishop.} Nxb6 {Thank yoooooooou.} 19. Nxf7+ Kc5 {I asked him if he wanted me to finish it or to mess some more. He picked mess.} 20. Qxg6 {His decision.} Nxc4 21. dxc4 {I'm expecting the king to take, resulting in me forking his bishop for no gain.} dxc4 {And then that happened. Meh. Changes not much.} 22. Nd6 Bd7 {There are times I love this game.} 23. Ne4+ {This is one of them.} Kb5 24. Rxd7 a4 25. Rxb7+ Ka5 {At this point it's mate in about three moves, but he wanted me to mess with him so mess I shall.} 26. Qf7 {Pawn pinning! That people, is how you mess. Take all the other guys pieces by pinning pawns with your queen lol.} Rh8 27. Qxe6 {And now I'm forking pawns. Comedy. Gotta be careful not to mate or stalemate here.} Rh4 28. Qxc6 Rxe4 {I think he knows I want all his pieces before winning, and wants me to mate him before I stalemate by being greedy. Or maybe he's just suiciding.} 29. Qxe4 c3 30. bxc3 a3 31. Qe7 Ka4 32. Rb3 Ka5 33. Qxa3# {That worked out rather nicely.}
