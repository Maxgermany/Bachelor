1. e4 {Normal.} e5 {Normal} 2. Nf3 {Normal.} d6 {Still normal, though Nc6 is more common.} 3. Bc4 {Developing. } h5 {? This is where black starts to go wrong - I prefer Nf6, attacking the undefended e-pawn. Perhaps he was thinking about attacking down the kingside.} 4. Nc3 {Again, developing.} Qd7 {?! Again, I prefer Nf6 or Nc6 or even Bg5 - this odd queen move blocks in the bishop and leaves a chance of a pin on the diagonal.} 5. Nd5 {! I give this move an exclamation since it ties the queen down to defending c7. } Qa4 {?? Oh dear - this leaves c7 vulnerable and wins a rook - but it also wins the queen. Not 6. Nxc7!? which looks obvious but ...} 6. Bb5+ {The perfect fork - watch out for this in your games, it comes across a lot.} Qxb5 {Black has no choice, but to take.} 7. Nxc7+ {And Nxc7! - winning a pawn and queen for the bishop - a lovely tactic: I came across this in 'Chess Tactics for kids' and it is rather good. And a rather good family fork.} Kd7 {I prefer Kd8.} 8. Nxb5 {And the knight chomps away the queen.} a6 {No surprise, but I think black should be thinking about developing here.} 9. Nc3 {I retreat.} h4 {Again, a pointless move - why not play Nf6?} 10. d4 {I open up the centre.} h3 {I think black is seriously into attacking the kingside. } 11. g3 {gxh3 is okay, but it opens the line for the rook, so I just played g3. } Be7 {Finally developing.} 12. dxe5 {I take the pawn, and the pawn can't take back since it is pinned.} Ke6 {I think the king is just waiting to be attacked.} 13. Qd5+ {This bold queen move makes the king retreat.} Kd7 14. exd6 {Note if Bxd6 then e5! wins the bishop.} Bxd6 {Unfortunately, he doesn't see this.} 15. e5 {e5!} Ke8 {The king retreats - probably the safest move.} 16. Qxd6 {So I take the bishop.} Ra7 {This leaves the knight undefended - I could have gobbled it up, but I was more focused on a mate.} 17. Nd5 {This subtle move threatens 18. Nc7#.} Nd7 {I think this move was just to save the knight, but this annoyingly prevents mate, since the king as d8 as a flight square - } 18. Bg5 {- so I take it away.} Ndf6 {An outright blunder - first of all, the pawn could take it, and, though I am not criticising my opponent, this falls for Nc7#. Which I gladly played.} 19. Nc7# {Nc7# - thank you for watching - please give any constructive comments if necessary. @oodle3#}
