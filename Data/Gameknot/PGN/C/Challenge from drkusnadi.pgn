1. e4 {my first annoted game. this game will remind you that you have to keep focus on every move. sometimes the 3 days per move can put you off guard, turning nice game into a terrible one. and visa versa. but, even when you seems lost, FOCUS. there's a chance that your opponents don't.} c6 {just a normal oppening move (i don't know much about the name of oppenings yet.} 2. c4 {i like to move this pawn, as it keeps it active, attacking the middle, instead of being blocked by Kc3. but now, having e4 and c4 at the same time on an oppening, is not a very good move. the d2 pawn is now obsolete with 3.  ..e5} a6 {i'm not sure what this is for} 3. Nc3 {starting developing pieces - knights first} e6 4. Nf3 {same here.} d5 {trying to attach pawn structure.} 5. d4 {pawns are guarded by pieces. dxc4 helps development, so continue to give way for c bishop} Bb4 {pinned. but, even if 6.. Bxc3 , having 7.bxc3 is not a very bad thing. it's just reinforcing more pawn to the center.} 6. a3 {forcing to take knight, so that b pawn can help guard d pawn} Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 dxe4 {i missed this one, but defence is still strong, and no attack yet from the opponents pieces.} 8. Ng5 {attacking e4.} Nf6 9. f3 {getting rid of the e pawn. if taken, queen develops, if e3, bishops develops. if not, fxe4} exf3 10. Qxf3 Nbd7 11. Bd3 {developing bishops and getting ready to 0-0} Qe7 {still no threats from black.} 12. O-O {0-0 and attacking f line.} h6 13. Ne4 Nxe4 {obvious trade off. getting rid of an attacker. but oppening up opportunities for white to attack, as the bishops are now on their position to attack king side.} 14. Bxe4 Nf6 {replacing defender.} 15. Bc2 {bishops is ready to snipe} e5 {destrying pawn structure, or attacking queen by e4.} 16. Re1 {pawn is pinned.} O-O {0-0 and preparing rook for attack. at this point, black is still up a pawn.} 17. Qg3 {threatening Bcxh5, pinning the pawn. and possible check mate.} Nh5 {removing threats.} 18. Qf3 {plan not working. back to an attacking position on f file. while attacking knight.} g6 {that's a bad choice by black, i think, destroying it's own pawn structure, which is crucial for defense. and further more, while two bishops are snipping in that direction.} 19. Bxh6 {boom, head shot by the sniper. } Re8 20. Rxe5 Qd8 21. Rf1 {putting the other rook active. attacking  f7, an easy target. } Be6 {guarding f7.} 22. Bxg6 {after analysing the board, and with 1 knights and 1 pawn up, i can have another pawn for a trade with my bishop. and also open up some interesting mate possibilities. even if not, just a nice trade off.} fxg6 {taken the bait.} 23. Rxe6 Rxe6 24. Qf7+ {forked.} Kh8 25. Qxe6 {and here, i'm 1 knight and 2 pawns up. a big possible win? well, a few move after this will tell you, that you can still loose if you don't focus.} Kh7 26. Be3 Qg8 27. Rf7+ {still basically in charge.} Kh8 28. d5 Ng7 29. Qxg6 {3 pawns up} Qh7 30. Qxh7+ Kxh7 31. Rxb7 {4pawns up.} Kg8 32. Bf4 {backing up rook to move to b6.} Rc8 {and here's where i stop thinking before i move, and all is going down.} 33. d6 {why didn't i sticked to the first plan? i just assume i can get this pawn to the back rank. uncalculated move. which is a very bad move.} Ne6 34. Be3 Rd8 35. d7 Nf8 36. Bg5 Rxd7 {3 pawns up.} 37. Rxd7 {a fair trade off, thinking that i'm 3 pawns up??  wrong!! } Nxd7 38. Be3 Ne5 39. c5 Kf7 40. h3 Nc4 41. Bc1 Ke6 42. Kf2 Ne5 43. Be3 Nc4 44. Bc1 Ne5 45. a4 {now why did i do that?} Nd3+ {arghhh.} 46. Ke3 Nxc1 {aghh.} 47. g4 Na2 {i actually have winning chance here. by attacking the knights, forcing black king to help, and giving g and h pawn it's freedom. 48.Kd2, which prevented the knight to go anywhere, unless the king helps. 48. .. Kd5. but then, i can start moving my pawn 49. g5 and forcing the king to return, thus me getting the knight. but i was only fearing to defend and safe pawn instead of attacking. not focus. } 48. c4 Nc3 49. a5 Ke5 {a very good move by black. this prevents white king to go to the back rank.} 50. Kf3 Ne4 51. h4 Nxc5 {another pawn is down. my chances are just with the g and h pawn. however it's harder as the black king is in a good position to prevent white king defending it's pawns.} 52. g5 {but then, i've got an idea. let black king go as far right as possible, while i'm taking it's pawns (and horse if possible on the left).} Kf5 53. Ke3 Nb3 54. Kd3 Nxa5 55. Kd4 Nb3+ 56. Kc3 Nc5 57. Kd4 Ne6+ 58. Kc3 Kg4 59. Kb4 Kxh4 {the king is on the farthest right, just as planned. now, taking the loot.} 60. Ka5 Nc7 {now this will show you that every step counts on a finishing game. the game can turn around easily. this oppens up a possibilities of draw or even winning, down from losing. } 61. Kb6 {gotcha. moving knight will lose a6. moving anything else will lose c6.  note: i can't take knight, as it will set loose the a pawn.} Kxg5 62. Kxc6 Kf5 63. Kb6 {still cannot take knight. but now attacking with c pawn, as it is closer to the back row. when it's close enough, then i can take the knight. and have the pawn race. but, mine is closer. and the black king is too far. i'm pretty sure black had some winning chances as well, but that's what playing more than 5 games with 3 days per move can make to your game. unless you stay focused, on every move.} Ke5 64. c5 Ke6 65. Kxc7 {i'm winning (please comment if i'm wrong). black is lost by time run out, not retired. however, even if black only move it's pawn, i still win one move, checking it's king first. moving black king wil mean white pawn is even ahead, and just by moving white king to b7 will protect it's way for a promotion.}
