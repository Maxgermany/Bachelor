1. Nf3 {This was my final game in a mini-tournament with several strong players from chessgames.com, in which I had met with very limited success. In this game I experimented with the Leningrad Dutch - and got lucky in a complex position.} d6 {I have recently taken to playing this flexible response to 1.Nf3. If white keeps me guessing, I will keep him guessing too.} 2. d4 f5 {Now I can transpose to a Dutch without worrying about the Staunton Gambit. } 3. c4 Nf6 4. g3 {The usual white strategy.} g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 {And now we have transposed into a typical Leningrad Dutch.} 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O Qe8 8. d5 {Cramping black's position, preventing any thrusts with the e-pawn, and intending to expand on the queen's side.} c6 {An important challenge to white's pawn.} 9. Rb1 {On the few occasions when I have played the Leningrad Dutch (only in blitz before this game) I have often been inconvenienced by Ng5. However white continues his queen's side strategy.} Na6 10. dxc6 bxc6 {This exchange sets the scene for the next passage of play, much of which focusses on the b-file and especially control of b5.} 11. b4 Bd7 12. a3 Nc7 13. Bb2 a5 {I wasn't sure about this move, which wasn't in any of the databases. White could have ended up with a passed a-pawn, though whether it would have been strong is another matter. I saw it as necessary to free my rather cramped position, intending to bring the other rook over to b8.} 14. Qb3 {This looks strong, but in the end the queen's position here was problematic for white. The d7 bishop is easily able to contest the diagonal, while the black rooks will attack the a and b files; and black also has good chances in the centre.} axb4 15. axb4 e5 {Occupying the centre and preparing ...Be6, at the cost of weakening d6 and possibly d5.} 16. Rfd1 Qe7 {This weakens black's grip on b5, but enables a successful regrouping over the next couple of moves.} 17. e4 {Counter-attacking black's centre. Now ...fe does not look good in the face of 18.Ng5.} Rfb8 {So continuing as planned.} 18. Ba3 {As it turns out the threatened discovered attack down the diagonal will again not materialize, and the exposed position of this bishop will overwork the white queen.} Nfe8 {I have recently discovered the merits of passive-looking moves like this through strong opponents' playing them against me. Funnily enough this knight eventually wins the game as an attacking piece.} 19. Nh4 {White begins a regrouping maneouvre of his own.} f4 {Inviting white to release my fianchettoed bishop...} 20. Bf3 {...which he ungenerously declines to do, continuing with his own plans instead.} Be6 {Now black challenges for the important diagonal.} 21. Ng2 Kh8 {Creating the threat of Bxc4, as the white queen is overworked.} 22. Be2 fxg3 {To avoid spending a tempo protecting this pawn. I considered ...Qf7, threatening the fork on f3, but that is easily avoided. The move played also opens a useful file.} 23. hxg3 Bf8 {Overprotecting d6 and releasing the knight and queen. There is also a latent threat to b4.} 24. Ne3 {White appears to have a strong clamp on d5. Black is grateful for the pawn on c6.} Qf7 {Not subtle, but probing.} 25. Na2 {White seems to have a lot of pieces piled up in this corner, and they are in some danger of ending up as targets.} Nb5 {Black takes advantage to move his knights into the centre with tempo.} 26. Bb2 {OK, I did want to move that knight to d4. At least it can stay where it is for the moment.} Nf6 {Having been relieved of its defensive duties, the other knight joins in.} 27. Bd3 {This has the downside of cutting the rook's control of d4; also the bishop is overworked here. 27.f3 might have been better?} Nd4 28. Bxd4 exd4 29. Nc2 c5 30. b5 {Both sides now have protected passed pawns, and both sides have a few holes. Unfortunately white also has a few overworked pieces.} Nxe4 {If now Bxe4 then ...Bxc4 and the black rook penetrates to a2. At the same time white has to watch f2.} 31. Rdf1 {An oversight, allowing the knight in to d2. Having said that, it is not obvious what white should do here. 31. Bxe4 doesn't work, while 31.f4 drops another pawn.} Nd2 {And 0-1 - white has no compensation for the impending loss of material and penetration of his position.}
