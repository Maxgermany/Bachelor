1. e4 {This game was part of a Caro-Kann thematic mini, in which I wanted to practise the Bayonet Attack. This is one game where I succeeded in breaking through.} c6 {The actual starting position.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {the Advance Variation.} Bf5 4. Nc3 e6 5. g4 {... and here is the Bayonnet Attack. The next few moves are theory, following Timman-Karpov and other games.} Bg6 6. Nge2 {The usual deployment, aiming for f4.} h6 {Avoiding the aggressive counter-thrust 6 ...h5, which leads to even wilder complications than those seen here.} 7. h4 c5 8. Be3 b6 {I wasn't sure about this move. It solves the immediate problem, but is too quiet, blocks the black queen from b6 or a5, and also weakens c6.} 9. f4 {Preparing white's thematic breakthrough on f5.} Be7 {An interesting zwischenzug forcing white to defend h4; but the blocking of the KN will prove expensive.} 10. Bf2 Nc6 11. f5 {White tries to break through, while knowing that black has some counterplay against the d4 pawn.} exf5 12. Nf4 {Now 12 ...fg is dubious because after 13.Nxg6 fg 14.Qxg4 black's king's side would be in a mess. The d5 pawn is also attacked.} cxd4 13. Nb5 {Threatenng Nxd4 or Nd6 rather than taking on d5. Bxg6 was also considered.} Rc8 {A useful move, but I'm not sure black really has time for it here.} 14. e6 Bh7 {An interesting decision. White clearly intended to take on g6 and wreck black's kingside. Black withdraws the bishop out of harm's way, but allows white to winkle his king out into the open.} 15. exf7+ Kxf7 16. gxf5 Bxf5 17. Bd3 {A crucial move. White prepares to open up the light squares around the exposed black king, besides catching up on a bit of development (this bishop has moved once, its black counterpart four times).} Bxd3 {Possibly underestimating white's plan, though it is unclear what alternative he has. I thought 17 ...Be4 looked interesting - I would probably have met it with 18.Qh5 .} 18. Qxd3 Ne5 {This was as expected. This knight was the only black piece I was worried about. It is insufficient, however, to counter all the threats.} 19. Qf5+ Bf6 {For some reason I had overlooked this rather obvious move (lesson: be more objective in analysis, even when things seem to be going well). Fortunately I still had enough tactical resources to press home the attack.} 20. Qe6+ {The rest is forced, as far as I can see.} Kf8 21. Nd6 {The point is that the black knight on e5 is now overworked, guarding against the mating threats Ng6# and Qf7#. The immediate threat is the simple deflection mate, 22.Ng6  Nxg6, 23.Qf7#. Black urgently needs to overprotect both these squares, and it seems that he can't.} Rc6 {A blunder, allowing the simple deflection and mate. I believe the position is lost in any case, as the knight is overworked and black cannot counter both threats. I had considered the following likely variations:  (a) 21 ....Rd7 22.Bxd4 Re7 23.Bxf5! Rxe6 23. Ng6#  (b) 21. ...Ne7 22.Bxd4 Rc7 (...Bxh4  doesn't help), 23.Bxf5 and if the knight moves, 24.Ng6# (otherwise 24.Qf7#).} 22. Ng6+ {deflecting the knight} Nxg6 23. Qf7# {....and mate.}
