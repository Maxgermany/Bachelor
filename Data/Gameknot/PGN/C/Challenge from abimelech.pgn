1. d4 {Once again I'm playing one of my favorite first moves for white. I would say that I most likely play d4 most of the time. To be honest, I really wish this game was rated. Right about now I could use some rating points.} Nf6 {One of the most usual and normal moves I usually see all the time. I'm usually picky about my second move because I usually like to avoid certain openings that I haven't seen in a while. } 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 c5 4. c3 b6 {In some way it started to look like a Colle system, which I always look forward playing all the time. When I saw ....b6 played by my opponent, the only opening I could think of was the Queens Indian Defence. I like playing against that opening every now and then but I have my off days.} 5. Nbd2 Bb7 {Looking for play along the a8-h1 diagonal which is very common when playing b6. At this point I was going to go face the Queens Indian for sure. } 6. Bd3 d5 7. O-O Bd6 {At this point of the game, I very happy where this game was going. We are now playing into a style that I'm used to seeing all time. So I started to relax and play normal with no stress.} 8. Qe2 O-O 9. e4 {This is where the game starts to get interesting to me. So far so good. No mistakes are made just yet.} dxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 11. Bxe4 Bxe4 12. Qxe4 Nd7 13. Bg5 {I wanted to get the last piece develop and also make the first attack in the game. f6 would be bad obviously because black would lose a pawn with 14. Qxe6  and I may even take the bishop as well. Not sure it that would be good but it's just a thought} Qc7 {Putting some pressure online the b8-h1 diagonal.} 14. Rfd1 {There's always a big difference as to which rook you move first. I really didn't like this rook to be moved because I thought it would be hard for me to get the other rook into play. I could be wrong but at the time I wish the other rook was moved instead.} Rae8 15. Qd3 {I didn't like that rook on the e-file so I moved my Queen to d3 to put some pressure along the d-file and also attack the Knight rather than the bishop because I know that would be the first piece my opponent would have to move first. Obviously my opponent saw that coming so he moved it out the way.} Nb8 16. Bh4 f6 17. Bg3 {I really wanted to trade off his good bishop at this point. I started to hate that bishop a lot because something about attacking along the diagonal wasn't making me feel comfortable at all.} Bxg3 18. hxg3 Red8 {Oh man, here comes the fun now} 19. Qc4 Rd5 20. dxc5 Qxc5 {I really started to think at this moment. I was trying to decide whether I wanted to take the Queens off the board or play a little bit longer with them on and see what happens. So I decided to keep the Queens in the game and I'm glad I did, which you would see later on.} 21. Qe4 Rxd1+ 22. Rxd1 {White is looking really good at this point. White rook have the open d-file for attack mode and looking forward to putting it along the seventh rank later on. Black is okay but attacking chances are rather slow at this moment.} Qc6 23. Qd3 {I wasn't ready to trade queens at this moment. I'm really happy with my position right now.} e5 {double attack coming up as we could see but of course I'm not going to let that go down. } 24. Qf5 g6 {I put my queen there on purpose just to see if he would attack me. I was also looking at 24. Qa4 instead of g6, but then black wouldn't have control of the square I was planning on putting my queen at, which is e6.} 25. Qc2 Na6 26. Qd3 {I "REALLY" didn't like this move after I realize a few things about this position. Although my opponent knew I was attacking his knight, he missed a rather good move where actually the game could've turn tables and be in his favor. I was looking at 26....e4 27. Qxa6 exf3 (if 28. Qxa7 then fxg2 and black could easily take control at this point of the game and probably even push those pawns down) 28 gxf3 Qxf3 and black is by far in a good position then white at this point. in fact, we might say that he's clearly winning in some way.} Nc5 {Black had his last chance on playing e4, instead he played Nc5, in which you would see why this was a bad move.} 27. Qc4+ Kg7 {Out of all moves, this was the very last move I thought that would be played. Qe6 is what I had in mind. 27....Rf7 would've been bad because of 28. b4.} 28. b4 Rc8 29. bxc5 Qxc5 {At this point of the game, I saw checkmate in so many ways. Now you see why I didn't feel like trading queens. At this point I hope you, especially my oppontent enjoyed my comments about this game. From here on out I'm going to let you play through the rest of the game. Please feel free to make any comments on anything that was good, bad, or whatever comes to mind.} 30. Rd7+ Kh6 31. Qh4# {}
