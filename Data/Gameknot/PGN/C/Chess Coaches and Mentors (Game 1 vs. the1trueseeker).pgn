[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C60), Cozio defence"]

1. e4 {This is my traditional opening, the King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {Black opens up with the King's Pawn Game, a usual response.} 2. Nf3 {I play the King's Knight Opening, again a popular move.} Nc6 {Black continues the King's Pawn Game.} 3. Bb5 {White plays the Ruy Lopez, exchange variation, again a popular move.} Nge7 {Well this is a move I don't think I've seen in any of my games until now, but it is in the book, the Ruy Lopez, Cozio Defense. } 4. O-O {That ends the book. I usually castle when I get the opportunity, and in this case, it came up real quick. } a6 {Many will retreat to Bba4, but others, like me, will play Bxc6 instead.} 5. Bxc6 {Of course, thanks to the Ruy Lopez Cozio Defense, I will not be able to play Nxe5 for black will clearly play Nxc6 now... } Nxc6 {...thus protecting the pawn. } 6. d3 {I give my e4 pawn protection.} d5 {Black attacks the e4 pawn. Computer analysis sees this as an inaccuracy and that Be7 would be the best move. It would because then black would have the option of castling.  } 7. Nbd2 {Computer analysis views this as a mistake. I don't think this is that bad of a move, although there were better ones. exd5 is seen as the best move. That is reasonable, but I see this move only as a inaccuracy. } Be6 8. h3 Na5 {Computer analysis views this as a mistake and that Be7 was the best move. Again, very true because it gives black the option of castling. There is a good reason why this is a mistake. (See next move)} 9. Nxe5 {Na5 by black allowed me to play Nxe5 this move, for the pawn no longer had protection. I now develop a slight advantage. } Bd6 {Good move by black. I now have to retreat my knight and this puts pressure on h2, which will be a factor later, and black can now castle. } 10. Ndf3 {I protect my e5 knight with the other knight. } dxe4 {A pawn exchange, it does disturb white's pawn development. } 11. dxe4 Nc4 {Black puts more pressure on white's e5 Knight. } 12. Nxc4 {I decide and exchange between two 3 point pieces, the two knights. } Bxc4 {This move though, allows black to attack white's f1 Rook. The rook will have to be moved so it can be protected.} 13. Re1 f6 {Computer analysis views this move as an inaccuracy and that 13. O-O would of been the best. Makes plenty of sense for it gives good protection to black's king. This move however, hurts black some because if and when black castles, his king won't be protected as well. } 14. Nd2 {I attack the c4 Bishop and protect my e4 pawn further, but computer analysis views this as a mistake and that e5 was the best move. It's definitely right because then both the knight and the rook would of protected the pawn on e5. 14. fxe5 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 16. Rxe5+ Kf8 (or Kf7) would result with black's king more exposed and unable to castle, giving white more of an advantage. } Be6 15. Qh5+ {I place the first check of the game.} Bf7 {I expected this move. I'll have to retreat my queen now.} 16. Qf3 O-O {Black now castles and gives his king good protection.} 17. c4 {I get the c pawn out. Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy and that Nb3 was the best move. I'm not certain why, but c4 still wasn't a bad move. } c5 18. b3 Qe8 {Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy and that Be5 was the best. Very true, for then I would have to protect my a1 Rook. } 19. Ba3 {Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy and that Bb2, one space back, was better. Very true, for it would of prevented an attack on the a1 Rook from the d6 Bishop.} a5 {Another inaccuracy from the computer analysis. It says this time Qe5 was better. Very true. The a1 rook is fine due to the e1 rook, but then black would threaten mate in 1 with Qh2#. I'd prevent that of course, but it would put white in a somewhat awkward position. } 20. g4 {Another inaccuracy from the computer analysis. It viewed e5 as the best move. I'm not so sure about that. If black played Bxe5, then white could play Bxc5, but instead, black would of likely played fxe5, thus losing white's small advantage, so I don't quite view e5 as the best. } g6 {Computer analysis views this as a mistake, saying again Qe5 was better. I mentioned why this was the best in move 19. This time though, black's f6 pawn is unprotected...} 21. Qxf6 {...so white's advantage grows to 2. I'm a bit surprised that the computer analysis views this as an inaccuracy. It says again e5 was the best move. Not Qxf6? Whatever the reasoning is, my advantage has grown regardless. Of course though, black is bound to attack my Queen. } Be6 {I must save my queen of course. Computer analysis views this move as another inaccuracy and says that Be5 was a better move. Very Very true. I would have to save my queen, but then black could take my a1 Rook, which then I would take black's Bishop. (Likely 21. Be5 22. Qf3 Bxa1 23. Rxa1 Be6 24. Qg2 (or around there)). This move doesn't hurt black although they miss an opportunity, so that is why it is only an inaccuracy. } 22. Qc3 Qf7 {Black prepares for an attack on f2. } 23. f3 {I stop the attack, or so I thought. } Qf4 {Thanks to black's bishop, an attack on h2 (or h3) was now imminent. } 24. Re2 {I prevent the attack on h2, but this move doesn't stop the attack on h3. Computer analysis views this as a mistake and that Bb2 was better. Mostly true. I would now have an opportunity to mate on g7, but black would more than likely continue with their plans, and then likely prevent a mate on g7, but overall, still the best move. } Qg3+ {Black continues their attack with h2. The h3 pawn is gone. Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy and that Be5 was the best. Very true, for it would prevent a possible mate on g7, which I pointed out on the move before this one.  } 25. Rg2 Qxh3 {As expected, the pawn goes, but the computer analysis views this as a blunder, yes a blunder, and that Be5 again was the best. I'd tell you why this is a blunder, but I'll show and tell instead, for I saw the opportunity. } 26. Bb2 {I now focus on mate on g7. } Kf7 {This does not stop my attack and my opportunity, but it does prevent mate. } 27. Qf6+ {The e6 Bishop is gone. } Ke8 28. Qxe6+ Be7 29. Rh2 {I was doing well until this move to attack Black's queen. Computer analysis views this as a mistake and that Be5 was better. I'm not quite certain how that helps or how this move was even any form of a mistake. I do know though that black was in a bad position and that white's advantage has grown to a big advantage. } Qg3+ {Black counters with a check. } 30. Rg2 Qd6 {This move can allow for a queens exchange, but I don't want to exchange queens, however, the only somewhat safe place for my queen is d5, which can still promote a queens exchange, leaving me with no choice but to accept it. } 31. Qd5 {At least with this move I can promote my pawn structure if a exchange is made. } Rd8 {??? No exchange? It would not matter as much if the b7 pawn wasn't wide open! No surprise that the computer analysis views this as a mistake. It also says that Qb6 was the best move. Reasonable for it protects the b7 pawn. } 32. Qxb7 {White's advantage grows to 5. } Qxd2 {?!?! My knight was well protected by the rook, but black must of overlooked that! No surprise that the computer analysis views this as a blunder! The best move would of been Bg5, which does start to develop a good attacking position for black, but what's done is done.  } 33. Rxd2 {Good thing black's rook is where it is to lessen the damage some. } Rxd2 {White has a major advantage now! Black though, is not willing to give up.} 34. Bg7 {I attack black's f8 rook. This move is viewed by the computer analysis as a blunder. (?) I didn't realize that my f3 pawn was wide open. e5 was the best move. This is certainly a mistake, but I don't see it as a blunder, but black does have an opportunity for an attack now. } Rxf3 35. Rf1 {I give my king some protection by my rook, but this ends up not really helping at all. Computer analysis views this as another blunder and that Qb8+ was the best move. I can accept this being a blunder because it puts white in an even worse position. Black will certainly play Rg3+ and after I move my king to h1, the g4 pawn is lost. } Rg3+ 36. Kh1 Bd6 {? What happened to Rxg4? Black's rook doesn't need protection. This is viewed by the computer analysis as a blunder. Why? Because now there was the opportunity for a mate in 2! Alas though, I did not see it at all. I am unable to show you the puzzle, for the comments do not allow me, but check out puzzle #121689 to see how the game would of ended if I did play the sequence. } 37. Qf7+ {Blunder by the computer analysis of course. As I said, I did not see the possible mate, but I had other plans. } Kd8 38. Bf6+ {Driving white's king back further.} Kc8 39. Qxh7 {I have a plan forming soon. Computer analysis views this as a blunder surprisingly and that Qe8+ was the best move, but I'll soon be glad I kept my queen on the 7 file. } Rxg4 {Now black takes my g4 pawn. } 40. Bc3 {I provoke the rook. Computer analysis views this as a blunder again and that e5 was the best move. Yes it is, for then it would drive back the Bishop to probably c7 and the next move would be Rf8#. Not to worry though, my next moves will seal black's fate. } Rxa2 {That pawn doesn't really matter now. The computer analysis views this as a blunder and that Rh2+ was the best move, which it is for then I would have no choice but to take the rook with my queen which then black would take with his bishop which then white would take with his King (40. Rh2+ 41. Qxh2 Bxh2 42. Kxh2 Rxe4) leaving white with a shrunken +2 advantage. Yet, it was another missed opportunity for black. } 41. Be5 {My plan was now in place. My plan was to sneak attack black. Thanks to black's Bishop, I cannot play Rf8#. I could of got rid of it sooner, but I missed that move. Now though, if black takes the bait and takes my Bishop, his fate is sealed. } Bxe5 {Black took the bait. It's all over. Mate in 1.} 42. Rf8# {Checkmate! It was a hard fought battle between me and the1trueseeker, but the victor was white. A lot of mistakes in this game. I'm glad it's a learning game. I hope you enjoyed this annotation. Feel free to comment and rate about it. I'll have game two available soon when it is complete. I'll also have two games with my other opponent in the tournament soon as well. This was a great game, and I know the others will be too!}
