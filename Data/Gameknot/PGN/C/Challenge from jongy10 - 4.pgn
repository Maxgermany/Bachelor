1. c4 {Trying something different: the English Opening} e5 {A typical response, and very familiar} 2. Nc3 {I'd like to prevent the 3 pawn coming down further} Nf6 3. Nf3 {Expecting the pawn to advance, but I'll jump out to g5} Nc6 {Oh... of course...} 4. a3 {Preventing the bishop coming out to b4.} Bc5 5. g3 {Preparing for Fianchetto} d6 6. Bg2 {fffffffianchetto} Bg4 7. b4 {What I like about this opening is it keeps the centre free of pawns.  This makes it ideal for bishops to beam down the long diagonals.  Here I'm preparing to do just that with my black bishop.} Bd4 8. Bb2 {So now my bishop is pinned, but I might trade out his black bishop soon.} O-O 9. Qc2 {I get two things from this move - backing up my black bishop so the pinned knight can move, and eyeing up his h7 pawn.  If he doesn't stop me, my next move will be knight to g5} h6 10. O-O {Yeah, that was way too obvious.  I wanted to castle eventually} Bxc3 11. Qxc3 {Taking it with the Queen so it's lining up along the long diagonal.} a6 12. b5 {I'm hoping the knight comes forward to d4 so I can trade it out and open up the middle.} Nd4 13. Nxd4 {Well, he came forward... but I feel like I'm walking into a trap} exd4 14. Qxd4 Bxe2 {A conditional move! Move the rook and attack it, so he needs to spend a move to back it up or move it.} 15. Rfe1 Re8 16. Bxb7 {Quid pro quo.  But I plan on taking 2 pawns.  Unless he does something about his g7 pawn, his knight is pinned.} Rb8 17. bxa6 {Bishop can chill out there for a while.  I could go crazy trading everything out and then push that pawn the rest of the way up.} c5 18. Qf4 {run away!} d5 19. cxd5 {I couldn't see any reason not to take it.  Possible sequence of Nxd5, bxd5, Qxd5, Rxe2, Rxe2, Qxb8.  Trades out a lot of material and I end up  5, as well as having a pawn 2 moves away from going the distance.} Bxa6 20. Bxf6 {Didn't see that one!  I will still trade everything out including the Queens, and I'll still end up  5.  I've set up conditional moves.} Qxf6 21. Qxf6 {1} gxf6 22. Bxa6 {2} Red8 23. Bc4 {Back up the d pawn.  I'll push the a pawn as far as a6, while he will probably start attacking it.} Kg7 24. a4 Rb4 25. d3 {Bum, he's going to get the a4 pawn once he plays Ra8.  I might start charging the d pawn and trade out rooks at the earliest opportunity} Ra8 26. d6 {}
