1. d4 {Sometimes there is no reason to lose a game other than perhaps we are playing more games than we are able to manage, or we are moving later at night or early in the morning. I lost this one for who knows what reason. The game was fairly even and I basically gave it away by not paying attention and noticing a really obvious threat. I do a d4 as I can handle a queen game better these days. } e6 {This usually means black is going to push his king bishop down and check me. It is annoying really. Not sure if I do the best thing but I do...} 2. a3 {a3, and that matter is closed, though I would have preferred to move my knight out or move my pawn to c4. CAn't always get what we want in this game. } Nc6 3. c4 Nf6 {He is doing well, with both his knights out. I have only moved out three pawns. Need to start developing some minor pieces. } 4. Nf3 Bd6 {He is going for a quick castle. } 5. Nc3 {I am a little relaxed with the way the board looks for now. Not good enough to tell who is more developed or not, but everything looks familiar enough for me. } O-O {He castles.} 6. e3 {Want to let my king bishop out. } a6 {Not sure if he had to do that as I usually am not too aggressive with my knights, but it is a common move. I might have thought pawn to b6 and set up a fianchetto but this works too.} 7. Bd3 {set up a castle and develop white bishop a bit.} Ng4 {Getting used to seeing this sort of aggressive type of play, where somebody sets up a few pieces to attack something like a pawn. I am not sure if this is a good or bad play on his part. Seems he has an covered minor piece a bit far down the board from his side.} 8. h3 {Easy to ward of the problem, and he moves his knight to...} Nh6 {h6, where its attack capabilities be come pretty limited. I seem to be doing okay. } 9. O-O {castle and things don't look too bad for either of us. } e5 10. d5 Ne7 {In fact here spider777 seems to be getting impatient and trying to force something into happening. I know the feeling and I used to be the same way, especially when the center of the board is all congested. Just trying to chip away at something. Mame something happen. These days I tend to find it is not the end of the world to let a congested board hang around for a while.} 11. e4 c6 12. Bxh6 {This seems like a good move to me though I usually would not like to trade off a bishop so soon, but it takes away a knight and opens up his castled position. In this aspect I see it as a trade with a bit of gain for me. } gxh6 13. b4 {Now I am starting to feel the pressure of the congestion, but I am not panicking. } Bc7 {Not sure if this was a good move or not, probably I wold have done something similar. } 14. c5 cxd5 15. exd5 d6 {I am starting to lose focus I think. I recall beginning to feel impatient about this point in the game. Things are even in material and I seem to be in a slightly better position and his king has become exposed. Maybe I get impatient and lax at the same time.} 16. c6 {I don't feel like I should have done this. I am suffering from tunnel vision. Maybe should have laid back and let him have been the aggressor here. } bxc6 {Yea, don't like it now. } 17. Qc2 {May seem like such an obvious attack that there is no point in doing it, but this sort of set up comes back later to haunt me. } Ng6 18. dxc6 {His pawn is left unguarded and I take it, but I can't really cover this pawn easily either.} f5 19. a4 {Not sure what either of us are thinking now. I am not sure if he is playing well. Seems like we both are not sure what to do and so we just slam some pawns up, but it becomes a little more dangerous a board in the process. } Be6 {Guess he is blocking a possible check. I tend to not make checks that go nowhere, but many players cannot pass on a check, even if in the process the other guy develops his pieces better in warding of the check. I think he may be thinking I will do that. In fact I have no real plan now. } 20. b5 axb5 21. Bxb5 {Even in material again though more and more I am comfortable playing a couple point down. Three or more points down worry me however, but sometimes a couple in the middle game (not end) does not freak me out the way it used to. } d5 {I don't like this. I get that weird chess headache thing I get a lot lately.} 22. Rae1 e4 23. Nd4 {Things do not seem that bad, but what the hell am I looking at or thinking about to let things go where they go now.} Qd6 {Remember the queen/bishop alignment I said would aunt me later? Here it is on his part, but much worse as his queen leads in the attack formation. So blasted obvious now that I look at it. Can prevent what he is setting up, but what do I do?} 24. Re2 {What is this even going to do? Where is my head? I do not even want to try and analyze my thinking, since with the next move... } Qh2# {the game ends and I honestly did not even see it coming.  What happened?  Why did I not see an obvious fatal threat?  I do not feel I was over confident. Maybe moving too fast, or I was looking at something else. Him moving his queen was something that should have made me alert and vigilant. But I let the game go. Not to say I have not done the exact same thing to other guys. I have. Seems to be a real problem with guys who hover under 1400 (like myself). I think it is some sort of fatigue almost. Tunnel vision and lack of drive in the game we are playing. Maybe focusing too much on another game and thinking of this one as one of those on the "back burner" I will get to when it gets dangerous. Sort of depressing to see your message area light up and check it out and see this. Good game spider777. }
