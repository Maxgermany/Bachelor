1. e4 {I play as Black.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 d6 {Giuoco Piano, LaBourdonnais variation } 5. h3 {5. d4 is the normal continuation. Instead Which chooses a more defensive role.} Nf6 6. b4 Bb6 7. d3 h6 8. Bb3 Be6 9. Bxe6 fxe6 10. a4 a5 11. b5 Ne7 12. Qb3 Qd7 13. O-O g5 {13...g5! Intentionally starting a kingside pawnstorm. } 14. Be3 Bxe3 15. fxe3 g4 16. Nxe5 {16. Nxe5! was a good move in that Black did not see it coming.} dxe5 17. Rxf6 gxh3 18. d4 {White doesn't follow up on h3 and so loses a pawn. The doubled pawn on e5 was undefendable and so deemed expendable for Black.} hxg2 {Black continues to open up the kingside.} 19. Rxe6 h5 {Not wanting to waste any tempo in the middle of board, Black continues with his kingside plans.} 20. Nd2 Rh7 21. Rxe5 O-O-O 22. Rc5 Qh3 23. Kf2 Rf8+ 24. Ke2 Rhf7 25. d5 Qh1 {Black tries forcing a trade.} 26. d6 {White strives to expose Blacks king, but overlooks the mate in 7!} Rf7f2+ {1} 27. Kd3 Rxd2+ {2 Sacrificing the Exchange!} 28. Kxd2 Rf2+ {3} 29. Kd3 Qf1+ {4 If White had taken Qf1 then it would have only made it a mate in 8.} 30. Kd4 Rd2+ {5} 31. Ke5 Ng6+ {6} 32. Ke6 Rxd6# {7# Thx for watchin' my game.}
