1. d4 {My current fave.} e6 2. e4 {I'll take more center...} d5 3. Bd3 a6 {I've never understood this move...  What gain?} 4. c4 {Queens Gambit?  (I call this "Three Pawns deffence / attack")} Qf6 {Attacks d4.} 5. e5 {I think I'll start a pawn push.  } Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Qe7 {Good move!  If I initiate a bishop exchange, his Queen can take b2.  I could play b3, or} 7. c5 {c5, trapping his bishop.  How will he respond?} Bxd2+ {Trade!} 8. Nxd2 {I like it.} Nh6 {Prep for o-o?} 9. b4 {Think I'll reinforce my picket.} Nf5 {Good development.} 10. Ngf3 Nc6 {The noble Knight attacks my undefended b4 pawn, so} 11. Bxf5 {I'll distract him with a trade, } exf5 {then,} 12. Qa4 {pin his Knight and cover b4.} Bd7 {Good response.  He could take d4, and I would need to save my Queen from his Bishop.} 13. O-O {I'll risk it.} a5 {He's totally focused on b4.} 14. b5 {b4 is just too hot.} Nd8 {His only choice I think.} 15. Qb3 {Speaking of undefended pawns...} Ne6 {He didn't notice.} 16. Qxd5 {Munch!} Nf4 {He's pressing his attack, gotta run...} 17. Qxb7 {Munch!} Rd8 {He should have castled.} 18. Qxc7 {Girls just want to do lunch...} Qe6 {Is it munch time again?}
