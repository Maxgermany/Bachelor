1. d4 {A nice game (mostly because of the enterprising play of my opponent) that I finally decided to annotate....} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 {A Nimzowitsch's idea: white has jus played g3 to defende one weakness (the a8-h1 diagonal) but, by doing so, he has created another (the c4 pawn) that black promptly attacks} 5. b3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Be7 7. Bg2 c6 8. Bc3 d5 9. Ne5 Nfd7 10. Nxd7 Nxd7 11. Nd2 O-O 12. O-O Nf6 {Now 12...Rc8 is more often played. Also 12...f5 is interesting, although I don't think it is completely sound (it prevents e4 but weakens the e6 pawn)} 13. e4 b5 {After Topalov vs Aronian (Corus 2006) Black usually avoids entering this line, 13...dxe4 is preferred...} 14. exd5 exd5 15. Re1 Rb8 16. c5 Bc8 {The bishop is completely useless on a6, so I'm trying to find a better place for it} 17. Nf3 Ne4 18. Rxe4 {! An extremely interesting idea: the e4 and c6 pawns will probably fall, and white will have two powerful passed pawns on d4 and c5} dxe4 19. Ne5 Qd5 {Trying to defend the weak e4 and c6 pawns} 20. Qe1 Bf5 21. g4 Bg6 22. f3 Bxc5 {!? The only way of getting rid of those annoying pawns...} 23. dxc5 Qxc5+ 24. Kh1 b4 25. Bb2 Qc2 26. Bd4 c5 27. Rc1 Qxa2 28. Bxc5 exf3 {f4 was threatened} 29. Bxf3 Rfe8 30. Qe3 a5 {? Rbd8 was probably better (see the follow up of the game)} 31. Bc6 {Bd5 was better... f7 is a very weak point...} Bc2 {?! A desperate move, better was 31...a4! with excellent counterplay (if 32. Bxa4 f6 is good for black)} 32. Bxe8 {?? Greedy. The simple 32. Bd5 Bg6 (forced) 33. Qf4 was winning...} Rxe8 33. Qd4 {Overestimating his position... 33. Qe2 was better, forcing an exchange of queens..} Bxb3 34. Nc4 {Bd5  and Qg7# was threatened...} h5 {!} 35. Nb6 {34. gxh5 Bxc4 35. Qxc4 Re1! 36. Bg1 Qxc4 37. Rxc4 Kh7 is a won endgame. 34. Ra1?! is also bad, but 34. Qd7!? was probably a better try} Re2 36. Bd6 Be6 {? Bc2 (with the threat of  37. ... Rxh7  38. Bxh7 Be4  39. Kg1 Qg2#) was a stronger move} 37. gxh5 {??} Bf5 {!}
