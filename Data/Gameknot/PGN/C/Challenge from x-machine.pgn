1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Now in the Scotch} exd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 5. Nxc6 Qf6 {I later look this up and find we are in classic Scotch at this point but I'm at the extent of my knowledge} 6. Be3 {According to book my continuation is generally 6. Qd2 dxc6 7. Nc3 which makes perfect sense but I'm off into the wild now} Bxe3 {Thus doubling my center e pawns} 7. fxe3 Qxc6 8. Nc3 {With my center compromised I decided to get back to the basics of development my pieces. I'm also thinking about a long side castle} Nf6 9. Qd4 {Protecting my doubled e pawn but mainly setting up for long side castle. Coincidentally, in a game I was playing with OldGus at this same time he had a bad doubled pawn and he told me, "If you have a bad doubled pawn try to get it do something" and this is what happens in the game continuation} O-O {Bringing the rook into play it looks very bad for my central pawns at this time} 10. O-O-O Re8 {Now things are looking grim from my central and doubled pawns} 11. Bd3 {Trying to protect that forward pawn as long as possible but also, mainly, getting more pieces into the game. 11. Bb5 is also possible and might be better} a6 {Preventing 12. Bb5 although if I was going to do this I would have done it last move. This seems like a loss of tempo to me especially with a big attack building in the middle in which I will never be able to cover the pawns. I thought 11. ... d6 planning on Bg4 eventually or 11. ... b6 setting up a fianchetto and more attacks on the forward e pawn might be better} 12. e5 {I figured this pawn was fairly well doomed and also liked the diagonal the bishop is now on as well. At the time I didn't realize this pretty much traps the Knight as well.} Re6 {A blunder I suppose although the knight can only move to 12. ... Nh5 13. g4 where it is trapped in any case. This does set up doubling the Rooks on the e file but the Bishop is still in the way and completely blocked making this a long term ambition} 13. exf6 Rxf6 14. Nd5 {With the Queen blocking 14. ... c6 the knight is in a strong position here threatening an immediate Royal Fork at Ne7 and potential trouble with Nxc7 sometime down the road} Re6 {Blocking the fork. 14. ... Kf7 15. Bxh7 is not possible and 14. ... Qe6 15. Bf5 Qxf5 16. Ne7+ wins the queen although is not forced} 15. Bf5 Re8 {It is still imperative to guard against Ne7. I was happy with the pressure I'm applying here after trapping the knight keeping black moving backwards and getting my pieces into good positions. Black's Bishop is still blocked and his Queen and active Rook busy defending against strong Knight moves} 16. Qh4 {Now I threaten a mating attack} Re5 {My opponent moves the same Rook for the third time which is probably not good in any case but completely overlooks the game continuation} 17. Qxh7+ Kf8 18. Qh8# {I botched the opening, as seems normal for me with King's pawn, but was aggressive in development, got my King to safety, and made use of my bad pawn. My opponent ended up with a trapped knight and I was able to build a strong attack with many threats one of which was overlooked.}
