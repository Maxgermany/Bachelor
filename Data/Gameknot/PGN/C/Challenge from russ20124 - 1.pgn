1. d4 {I hope it was worth while } Nf6 2. c4 {Out of the book already.} d5 3. c5 e6 {  Don't need black rook on e4} 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Nf3 {King-side development.  try to retain complexity in centre.} O-O 6. b4 {b4 Since black has decided to castle king side I am looking at the diagonals pointing in that direction.} b6 7. e3 {Completes a pawn-chain that seems strong to me, but i could be wrong.  Anyway the ws bishop can get out.} Nbd7 8. c6 Bxb4 {Good move.  White won't get the pawn back easily.} 9. Qc2 {Pawn takes knight is no good now because a check followed by exchanges loses white all the initiative.} Nb8 10. Ne5 {Trying to retain the nuisance of the c pawn. } Qd6 {A big gun for this poor little pawn.  Very cool play Russ!} 11. Bd2 Bxc3 12. Qxc3 {I can keep the c pawn company, and no black pawns can get at it.} Ne4 {If GK were more polite it would say 'guardee' (guarday) like we used to over the board.} 13. Qc2 Nxd2 14. Kxd2 {Maybe castling is not such a big deal now, but i was glad to see that night on e4 back in the dug-out.} a5 {Black is hoping to exchange on a6 to get a piece in play - we will have to think about that.} 15. Bd3 g6 {could be interesting if i can get my h pawn up.} 16. h4 Ba6 {I think black will pass the h pawn if it goes up just now,  and i don't like giving black the choice of rook or knight on the bishop exchange.  Also a3 will be needed to prevent  the knight coming after my queen.  I am not too worried about the queen check.} 17. Bxa6 {On balance, i don't like that diagonal under enemy control.} Rxa6 {With the b pawn on b5 my little pawn will be feeling quite unwanted.  But i am looking at h5 and a knight sacrifice.  The rook check at f2 would be nasty if knights are exchanged on e5.  Can black resist my mating threats?  } 18. h5 b5 {Bringing the rook to my poor c pawn that wishes no harm to anyone.  I had planned night takes g6, but now  the black rook on c6 does not look healthy.} 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Ke2 Nxc6 21. f4 {A knight exchange does not suit me, but it may be the lesser of evils.} Nxe5 22. dxe5 Rc6 {Black is buying a move, i don't want to exchange anything, and already i am wishing to have taken the g pawn with the knight instead of allowing the exchange. } 23. Qb2 {This was a terrible move. The white queen has to avoid exchange, guard c2, and black's three pawn majority is decisive.  } Qe7 24. g3 Rc4 25. Qxb5 a4 {I hope it was worth while breaking up the pawns a bit, but need to get out of here sharpish.} 26. Qb1 Qb4 {Exchanging queens does not seem so bad with a one point deficit, but the passed c pawn is dangerous.} 27. Qd3 {However a more experienced player like to keep the board as complex as possible.  Remarkably correct (in my poor estimate) play for a 1100+ rated player.  Any complacency long went out of the window.} Rc3 28. Rhb1 {I want the queens off now because it is active against my king.} Qc4 {Now the exchange is forced.  } 29. Qxc4 Rxc4 30. Rbc1 Rxc1 31. Rxc1 Rc8 {I want the rooks off for the same reason as the queen.} 32. Rc6 Kf7 {Attacking the e-pawn gives me a move to get onto the black a-pawn.  This pawn is dangerous.} 33. Ra6 c5 34. Rxa4 c4 35. Ra7+ {This check does little more than push the black king back a little while i get the rook into the b-file.} Kg8 36. Rb7 c3 37. Rb1 c2 38. Rc1 Rc3 {Not good for by rear pawns.  Can't attack the rook and pawn because of the d-pawn's advance.} 39. Kf2 h5 40. a4 {Black has to stop this pawn, and lose the c-2 pawn.} Ra3 41. Rxc2 Rxa4 {The d-pawn can't get past my e-pawn, and the exchange is not too bad.  At this point i am not sure how to use the advantage of my connected pawns, but the king is going to help.  I have to avoid a perpetual check situation.} 42. Rc6 {Attack the pawn - be on hand for the d-pawn - glue the king to the back rank for a bit.} Kf7 43. Rc7+ Ke8 {f8 might have been a better stop.} 44. Rg7 {g6 can't be saved, but advancing it would have broken up my pawn structure.} d4 {This diversion was to be expected.} 45. exd4 Rxd4 46. Rxg6 Kf7 47. Rg5 Rd2+ 48. Kf3 Rh2 49. Ke3 {There is nothing else i want to move at the moment.  There is no real point in trying to keep the g-pawn, but there is a way to get the black rook out of this corner.} Rh3 50. Kf2 {The black h-pawn is isolated, the black rook can't look after it, my king needs to get in among the pawns.} Rh2+ 51. Kg1 {h2 must seek open spaces.} Rd2 52. Rxh5 {No distractions needed} Rd8 53. Rh6 Rg8 54. Kg2 {The king is coming up here to avoid dodging checks in the open.} Kg7 55. Rf6 {The rook can sit here while the king comes into play.} Re8 56. Kh3 Re7 57. Kg4 Rf7 58. Rxf7+ {Easier with the rooks off.} Kxf7 59. Kg5 Kg7 60. Kh5 Kf7 61. Kh6 Ke7 62. g4 Kf7 63. Kh7 {Now the g-pawn can march straight through,} Ke7 64. g5 Kd7 65. g6 Kc6 66. g7 Kd5 67. g8=Q Ke4 68. Qg4 {The king and queen just combine to limit the black king's movement.} Ke3 69. Kh6 Ke4 70. Qg6+ {The pawns just get in the way of a simple mate.} Kxf4 {}
