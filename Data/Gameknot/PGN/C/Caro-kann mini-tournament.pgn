1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 {The opening set up of a themed mini tournament.} 3. e5 {I decided on the advance variation, hoping to limit the mobility of black's Ng8.} Bf5 4. Bd3 {Hoping to exchange light squared bishops with developing momentum.} Bxd3 5. Qxd3 {Accomplished.......} e6 6. Ne2 Qb6 {This move surprised me....I'm always a little scared when stronger players bring their queen out in front of their pawn chain. My dark bishop is now tied down....} 7. O-O Nd7 8. b3 {Attempting to free the dark squared bishop.} c5 {Black starts swinging. If I take, he has three options to re-take. I don't want to allow Bxf5 with developing tempo. So,....... } 9. c4 {I swing right back at him, creating numerous potential complications. I'm hoping this creation of some space will render me at least even after the captures that surely will take place.} cxd4 10. f4 {Risky, to say the least. My e pawn must be protected, but I've allowed a potential disaster by opening my king up to an attack from black's queen. At this point I don't know what's more important - regaining the pawn I've lost or completing development.} dxc4 {Pressing the pawn advantage. I'm starting to sweat.} 11. bxc4 {I have to re-take. Of course, I'm not thrilled with the isolated pawn.......} Bc5 {Protecting his d pawn, and bearing down even further on my king.} 12. Nd2 Ne7 13. Rb1 {Trying to make something happen.......} Qc7 14. Nb3 {And I see the return of the pawn on the horizon.} b6 15. Nexd4 Nf5 {I didn't anticipate this. Now I've voluntarily walked into an ugly pin. I do however, see a way to at least delay it's effects.} 16. g4 Nxd4 17. Nxd4 {Same pin, but now at least I have a little room to move......} O-O-O {Black has now completed development, but I was surprised he castled long. I would have thought he would go the other way. His queen and king are now on a half open file, and I would like to take advantage of that.....} 18. Be3 {Finishing my own development, and interposing the pin.} g5 19. Qe4 Bxd4 {Surprising.....I now have dreams of pinning his queen against his king. Then I realize of course that a player this strong would only make this trade off for a reason, so I get a little concerned.} 20. Bxd4 Nc5 {Forcing me to repay his trade in kind.} 21. Bxc5 Qxc5+ 22. Kh1 Rd4 {Whoops! He left the back door wide open.......} 23. Qa8+ Kc7 24. Qxh8 Qc6+ {After winning a rook, I realize that my king better tighten up his laces because he's about to start doing a lot of running.} 25. Kg1 Qc5 26. Rf2 {Seeing the danger of a discovered check, but severely restricting this rook's effectiveness.} Rxf4 27. Rbf1 Rxg4+ 28. Kh1 Qc6+ 29. Rf2f3 {My opponent is pinning me left and right. My material advantage is pretty worthless right now. I have to get my queen back in the game!} Rf4 30. Kg2 g4 {YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!} 31. Qxh7 {Trying to get my lady back into the fray.} gxf3+ 32. Kg3 {Now I get at least ONE move avoiding a check, but at the cost of losing another pawn.} Qxc4 33. Rxf3 {Taking back a pawn and trying to create some space for my leader to hide.} Rg4+ 34. Kh3 Rf4 35. Rb3 Qf1+ 36. Kg3 Qf2+ 37. Kh3 Rf3+ {Forcing the rook exchange.} 38. Rxf3 Qxf3+ 39. Kh4 Kc6 40. Qc2+ {Now my queen is back in play, but I'm still a pawn down and if my king has to move another square he will surely fall over from exhaustion.} Kd5 41. Qa4 {Not sure what I was thinking here. A forced queen exchange surely cannot be good for me.} Qe4+ 42. Qxe4+ Kxe4 43. Kg5 {And there is the move! My h pawn can now start running:)} Kxe5 {Big mistake. Black's king is now on the a1-h8 diagonal, and I'm gonna queen on h8!} 44. h4 f5 45. h5 f4 46. h6 f3 47. h7 f2 48. h8=Q+ {Mission accomplished. Now it's time to pick off the f and e pawns.} Ke4 49. Qh1+ Ke3 50. Qf1 Kf3 51. Kf6 {And black resigned. A well played game by my opponent up until 43...Kxe5. He was very gracious in defeat, and a true gentleman. One of my better performances in quite a while:)}
