1. e4 {standard king's pawn opening } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {I always play nc6 in this opening } 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. Nc3 {normally as white, I play c3, so this was expecting to me} Nf6 5. d3 O-O 6. Nd5 {This caught me totally off guard. I was not expecting a attack so soon...} Nxd5 {so I took it} 7. Bxd5 Ne7 {probably a mistake in my side} 8. Nxe5 {I didn't realize he could take the pawn} Nxd5 9. exd5 Re8 {a desperate attempt to win back some material} 10. d4 {the doubled pawns make him weaker, but they threaten my bishop } Bb6 11. O-O d6 {maybe a mistake to chase away the knight? } 12. Nd3 Qf6 {I don't know why I played this. It seems kind of reckless.} 13. c3 { a good move, my queen is out there doing nothing} Bf5 14. Nf4 Rad8 15. Re1 Rxe1+ {I shouldn't have taken it, it gives up the open file} 16. Qxe1 a6 {no point to this} 17. a4 Ba7 18. Ra2 {maybe just a waiting move, I think we were wondering who would attack first} Bb1 {my turn} 19. Ra1 Bf5 20. b4 {he is trying to trap my bishop} c5 {trying to trade off pieces} 21. dxc5 dxc5 22. b5 axb5 23. axb5 Bb8 24. Ra8 {this move is still puzzling to me, why did he just try to attack me? } Bc7 25. Rxd8+ Bxd8 {trading down, probably a bad idea because I was down on material} 26. c4 Qe7 27. Qc3 b6 {cutting his pawns off } 28. h3 {making an escape route for his king} Bc7 29. Be3 Be5 30. Qa3 {taking the open h file} Qb7 {blocking the queen from checking} 31. g4 Bd7 32. Nd3 Bd6 33. Kg2 Bb8 {just trying to defend now} 34. Bf4 Bxf4 {maybe a bad trade} 35. Nxf4 h6 {an escape route} 36. Kg3 Qc7 {setting up a g5 pin on the knight} 37. h4 {he doesn't notice} g5 38. hxg5 hxg5 39. d6 {he tries to stop my queen} gxf4+ {but I can still take it} 40. Kxf4 {kf3 might have been better because I can check him now.} Qxd6+ 41. Kf3 Qf6+ {series of checks with me trying to win material} 42. Kg3 Qe5+ 43. f4 Qe1+ 44. Kf3 Qd1+ 45. Kg3 Qxg4+ {he drops the g4 pawn} 46. Kf2 Qxf4+ 47. Qf3 {trading queens, a bad idea as i am up in material and my bishop can easily pick off his remaining pawns} Qxf3+ 48. Kxf3 Be6 49. Ke3 Bxc4 {munchy munchy} 50. Kd2 Bxb5 51. Kc3 f5 52. Kd2 f4 {trying for a queen } 53. Ke1 {He resigns next move. Game over.} c4 {Thanks for listening!!!!!!!}
