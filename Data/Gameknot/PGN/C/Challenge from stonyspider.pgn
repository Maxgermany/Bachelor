[Opening "Sicilian (B30), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {the rossolimo var of the sicilian, where white plays as in ruy lop} 3. Bb5 Qc7 {g6 is also played, but risking pawn structure} 4. c3 {seems better to develop a piece or even d3} Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. Re1 d5 {maybe Nf6 is safer} 7. c4 e6 8. cxd5 exd5 9. d3 a6 10. Bxc6+ Qxc6 11. dxe4 dxe4 {the real drawback of castling late and black is still a move away} 12. Ng5 {pressure on the pawn} Be7 {a must move.  black has to castle} 13. Nxe4 O-O 14. Nbc3 Be6 15. Bg5 Rad8 {Bxe7 seems better} 16. Qe2 Bxg5 17. Nxg5 Bc8 18. h4 Rfe8 19. Qc2 Qg6 20. Qb3 {The queen exchange might have helped white, breaking up king cover to boot.  granted, the black rooks are centralized and the B has decent scope, but the threat of Qxf7 is only slight} b5 21. Rxe8+ Rxe8 {black is fine with the open file.  the white rook hasn't moved and the N on c3 is far from action} 22. Rc1 h6 23. Nf3 {now the g-pawn is pinned} Bh3 {a very real mate threat.  24. Ne1 Rxe1+ 25.Rxe1 Qxg2#.  24.Qxf7+ is a desparado move  } 24. g3 Qd3 {the N needs to move, though 25. Qd1 might have worked} 25. Ne1 {the white rook is blocked from helping though the N covers the mating square} Qf1+ 26. Kh2 Rxe1 {eliminates the only defender} 27. Rxe1 Qg2# {}
