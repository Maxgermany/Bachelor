1. d4 Nf6 {Standard Stuff} 2. c4 g6 {Still nothing unusual} 3. Nc3 d5 {I play the Grunfeld.} 4. Nf3 Bg7 {4. Nf3 is less common than cxd5 but perfectly playable. One can transpose into the other.} 5. Bf4 O-O {I knew White had a little combination here to win a pawn, but Black gets counterplay.} 6. cxd5 Nxd5 {So White plays it. Note that White cannot transpose into the main line of the Grunfeld Exchange variation with 7. e4?? because of NxBf4. I have had an opponent play that a drop a Bishop!} 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 {White continues with his plan} 8. Bxc7 Bg4 {I am actually far more familiar with this gambit when White has played e3 rather than Nf3. 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 Bg7 5. e3 O-O 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 8. Bxc7  Then Black can regain the pawn with Na6 9. Bxa6 Qxg2 10. Qf3 Qxf3 11. Nxf3 bxa6  I was thinking for myself now! Looking at the Databases afterwards, I see that 8. Bg4 is not best in this position, either Nc6 or Na6 seems better.} 9. e3 Na6 {If played a move earlier, White can't take this knight of course. This move is not on the database, Nc6 is the only move which is. After the game I compared my moves with the computer recommendation. Computer does like Na6 and assesses the position as equal.} 10. Bxa6 bxa6 {Best moves for both sides.} 11. O-O Rac8 {Computer also likes Qb2 here winning back the pawn. I didn't see it! Computer also quite likes my move. Black has got compensation for the pawn here.} 12. Bg3 Rc6 {Computer likes these moves.} 13. h3 Bh5 {With the Bishop on g3 I can afford to keep my Bishop a bit longer. Computer agrees with me.} 14. Re1 Rfc8 {I was beginning to like my position. How is he going to contest c file? The White queen can only go to e2 otherwise he loses a pawn on f3. He can't move his Ra1 without the pawn on a2 going. Computer agrees with my move, but thinks White is slightly better.} 15. e4 Qd8 {I wanted to keep up the pressure on the d pawn. I did consider Qa5 too. The computer likes Qb5 and considers the resulting position equal.} 16. Be5 Bxf3 {I thought I could win back the pawn here, if he took back with the queen. Once again, I overlooked a move!} 17. Qxf3 f6 {Right, now he has to move the Bishop, then I take the d pawn with my queen. I bet you can see what I missed, and what he played next move. Easy to see when you have someone hinting that something is on! Harder to see a couple of moves back when I exchanged on f3.} 18. d5 Rc6c4 {Of course! Now if I had played Rc2 after Bc3 my rook is trapped. Computer agrees with my move, and thinks White is +1.57. I have to agree!} 19. Bc3 Qd6 {Computer agrees with this.} 20. Qe3 Rc8c7 {Computer prefers Qb6, but I wanted to keep queens on, as I am a pawn down. "Exchange pawns but not pieces" is the general advice when material down.} 21. Rad1 e6 {In line with what I said before....} 22. a3 e5 {But now I felt that I wanted to close up the position. I can't allow a central file to open, and for him to check on my back rank, as if I play Bf8 he has Bb4 - the point of a3.} 23. Bb4 Qd7 {Computer agrees with this.} 24. Rdc1 f5 {I can't avoid at least one rook exchange on the c file, so I advance on the king side. Maybe I can exchange a pawn or two or open up his king side. Computer prefers Qc8} 25. Rxc4 Rxc4 {Forced.} 26. f3 f4 {He secure the king side and I push on with tempo. Computer likes this move.} 27. Qb3 Rc8 {Computer likes this move and assesses the position as +2.94 for White. I have to agree. I thought I was going to lose.} 28. Qd3 Qb7 {Computer prefers Qb5, but I really don't want to exchange queens in this position!} 29. Kh1 Bf6 {Harry puts his king out of the way of checks, but h2 may have been a better square. I bring my bishop back into action. It has very limited scope now on g7.} 30. Rd1 a5 {Of course if he takes it, I take the b pawn, my queen is active and I have exchanged my doubled pawn. I was dreaming of 31. Bxa5 Qxb2  32. Rb1 Rc1+ 33. Rxc1 Qxc1+ 34. Kh2 Bh4 and I am threatening mate! 31. Bxa5 Qxb2 32. d6, as the computer pointed out afterwards, seems to win for White! } 31. Bc3 Kf7 {So preparing to use my King if necessary, to help block and/or round up the passed d pawn.} 32. d6 Rc5 {Played to stop a queen check on d5.} 33. d7 Bd8 {Forced!} 34. Qd6 Qb5 {I wanted to give extra protection to my pawn on e5.} 35. Qd2 Ke6 {Computer likes 35. Bxa5 and if QxB then 36. b4 wins.} 36. Qe1 a4 {I'm not sure what he is trying to do!} 37. Qd2 a5 {Now of course, he hasn't got that little fork on b4 as I have 38. Bxa5 Qxa5 39. b4 axb3 e.p. } 38. Qd6+ Kf7 {Similar to a position we had before.} 39. Qd3 Qc6 {He doesn't seem to be getting anywhere!} 40. Qd2 Ke6 {Computer still thinks White has a large advantage +2.93 and suggests opening up the King side with 41. g3 g5 42. h4} 41. Qc2 Qb5 {And now it suggest 42. Qf2 and White is +1.96. Instead he played} 42. Qd2 {and offered a draw, which I was only too happy to take! Computer still thinks White is about +2 in this position. Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed, please rate my annotation, and leave a few comments!}
