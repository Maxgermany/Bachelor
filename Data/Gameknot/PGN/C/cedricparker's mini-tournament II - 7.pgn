1. e4 {This was my first mini-tournament game.  I didn't know what to expect.} e6 2. d4 c5 {I've been experimenting with the Franco-Benoni.  It's not so common, but often morphs into interesting positions from other openings.} 3. dxc5 Bxc5 {Usually White is not willing to trade a flank pawn for a center pawn and to help Black develop.} 4. Nf3 Qb6 5. Qd2 Nf6 6. Bd3 {White's position here is fine.  In fact, I think it's preferable to Black's.} d5 7. e5 Ne4 8. O-O {I was expecting Bxe4.} Nxd2 {A surprising oversight.  White resigned on the spot.  I'm sure this was not typical play for this 1601-rated player.}
