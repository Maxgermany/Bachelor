1. e4 d6 {Ah e4, let's have some fun with the French e6. oops I've moved the wrong pawn!} 2. d4 {Now what? I've no idea about this opening!} Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4 Bg7 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Be2 c6 7. O-O Qc7 {I'm not very happy about this position. White clearly has more space and once he opens the F file will have a lot of pressure on f7.} 8. e5 {White advances. I can't afford to take yet.} Nd5 9. Ne4 Nd7 {I must try and develop} 10. c4 {White continues to drive my knight} Nd5b6 11. Nfg5 Bf5 {White builds extreme pressure in the centre. I must retreat the bishop blocking the f pawn and attacking the knight. I don't like the idea of exchanging bishops and bringing white's queen onto the e-file.} 12. Ng3 h6 13. Nxf5 gxf5 14. Nf3 {I feel a bit better about the position now. I have an open file opposite white's king and my pawn on f5 prevents white advancing his f4 pawn. But what to do with my own king? } O-O-O {I wasn't convinced about castling Q-side, but I'd been thinking too long and had to do something.} 15. Qc2 {White immediately attacks the unprotected f5, but I would have been more worried by a rook on c1 with threats to my K & Q.} dxe5 16. fxe5 e6 {so my position looks more solid, but my bishop is completely out of the game except for a long term threat on e5.} 17. a4 {White starts his attack on my king.} Nf8 {At first sight a strange move, but it gives some breathing space for my king, opens the d file for my rook and gives an alternative square for my knight on b6 for when the inevitable a5 comes.} 18. Bd2 {perhaps white aims to pin my knight on b6, or get his bishop to d6. So I move my knight and plan to swap my rook for bishop and pawn if it gets to d6.} Na8 {Not the strongest square for a knight, but here it also protects my queen in case needed.} 19. b4 {Another pawn to the attack.} Ng6 20. Rfb1 Kd7 21. b5 Ke8 22. bxc6 bxc6 23. Ra3 Kd7 {Do a runner, or stand and fight?!} 24. Rab3 Rdb8 25. Ba5 Qxa5 26. Rb3xb8 Rxb8 27. Rxb8 Nb6 {So I'm now the exchange down, but have threats to e1.} 28. Rb7+ Ke8 29. d5 {Time pressure? d6 looks powerful, but I have an initiative and my bishop is at last free.} Qc5+ 30. Kh1 cxd5 31. Rxa7 Bxe5 32. a5 Nd7 {I think this is a must to block the queen check on a4} 33. Ra8+ Ke7 34. a6 Bb8 35. Qb2 Ba7 36. Qb7 Bb6 37. Rc8 Qe3 38. c5 Bxc5 39. Rxc5 Qxc5 40. a7 Qc1+ {Don't panic!} 41. Ng1 Nf4 {Finally moves 18 & 19 pay off!} 42. Qb4+ Kf6 43. a8=Q {White gets his 2nd queen.} Nxe2 44. Qa7 d4 45. Qaxd4+ Nxd4 46. Qxd4+ {At this point white offered a draw, which black foolishly declined.} Ne5 47. h3 Qe1 {and after several more moves black was unable to convert the small advantage and lost on time.}
