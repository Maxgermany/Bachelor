1. c4 {first game with argentinian Ricardo. I salute thou. } e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 f5 {These good players always like better what I dislike. If you want to punish me, play f5 with black: i always will be embarrassed. In this game, I succeeded to outpast the opening, fortunately.} 4. d4 e4 5. Ng5 {I admit I searched for this solution. I had no idea before to play Ricardo what to do here. And I must admit it is very intersting.} Nf6 6. g3 Bb4 7. Bg2 O-O 8. O-O h6 9. Nh3 Kh7 10. Nf4 {Knight is back to active.} Bxc3 11. bxc3 d5 12. cxd5 Nxd5 13. Nxd5 Qxd5 14. Bb2 {I was thinking to myself that this position is very promising for both camp. black has more space, but white has the two bishops well placed, with a lot of possible discoveries.} f4 {and more space to black} 15. Qc2 Bf5 {I must admit i underestimated this move} 16. Qb3 Qxb3 17. axb3 {But still think I am better here. What do you think, ricardo?} a6 18. Rfe1 Rae8 19. e3 {maybe I shouldn't have played this, but I really planned the next moves here.} f3 20. Bf1 h5 21. h3 Ne7 22. c4 c6 23. Kh2 Rea8 24. Ra5 b6 {weakening a6} 25. Ra2 Ra7 26. Rea1 Rfa8 {so black rooks are subdued} 27. b4 {and I was pretty sure I could pass here.} Bd7 28. h4 {preventing move} b5 29. Bc3 Kg6 30. Ra2a5 bxc4 31. Bxc4 {Until here, i still feel optimistic, but we had an exchange here and ricardo told me the same: we don't know where it will arrive.} Bc8 32. Rg5+ Kh6 33. Raa5 g6 {and now what? I am still blocked in my hopes to play d5, because b4 will be exposed to rooks attack after exchanges.} 34. Rge5 Bf5 35. Kg1 Ng8 36. Kf1 Nf6 37. Be6 {blunder, here, i guess} Ng4 {underestimated this. rook has no escape} 38. Rexf5 gxf5 39. Bxf5 {a bishop and a pawn against a rook: viable...} Nf6 40. Be6 Re8 41. Bc4 Rd8 42. Rxa6 {big blunder: i went thinking: a bishop and two pawns are better than one.} Rxa6 43. Bxa6 Nd5 44. Be1 {another blunder. I think.} Rb8 45. Bd2 {and play again... :-(} Nxb4 46. Bxb4 Rxb4 47. Ke1 Ra4 48. Bc8 {and another one: i guess I panicked} Ra1+ 49. Kd2 Rf1 {hehehe...} 50. Bb7 Rxf2+ 51. Ke1 Re2+ 52. Kf1 Rxe3 53. Bxc6 Kg6 54. d5 Kf5 55. Bd7+ Ke5 56. Be6 Rc3 {i resigned. last ten-fifteen moves are obvious ones. I had nothing more... good game by Ricardo}
