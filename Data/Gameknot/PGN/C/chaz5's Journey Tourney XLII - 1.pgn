1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Nothing special} Nf6 {?! This is an inaccuracy, as if he recaptures with his knight I can chase it and get a strong center.} 3. cxd5 Nxd5 4. e4 {As I mentioned earlier} Nb4 5. Bd2 e6 {He discovers a defense} 6. a3 Nb4c6 {And look at the position now. His knight s blocking in his other knight.} 7. Bc3 f5 {While it *does* strike out at my center, I think it's too weakening.} 8. exf5 exf5 9. Qh5+ {It doesn't really accomplish anything, but it forces him to cause mega weaknesses.} g6 {Owwww Look at his king. Completely uncovered. He has both light square and dark square weaknesses.} 10. Qh3 Nxd4 {?? This loses material.} 11. Qe3+ {! If he blocks with his knight I win his rook, otherwise I win his knight.} Ne6 12. Bxh8 Nc6 13. Bc3 {I extricate my bishop.} Bc5 14. Qd2 Qe7 15. Be2 f4 16. Nf3 Ng5 {I start thinking about a pin} 17. O-O Nxf3+ {Oh thank you, now there's nothing blocking the pin.} 18. Bxf3 Bf5 {Allows the pin, but the bishop can block it.} 19. Re1 Be6 20. Bd5 {I add more pressure to the bishop.} O-O-O {He counterpins} 21. Rxe6 {! If he captures I recapture with my bishop and he takes my queen leaving me up a piece.} Qg5 {! This avoids the trade but allows a fork, so this looks bad. But if I fall into the trap(I do) he can play Bf6 Qxd5 winning his piece back. } 22. Bf6 {?? I fall for it} Qh5 {?? And he misses it.} 23. Bxd8 Nxd8 {Much better than the king recapture, as it would walk into a discovered attack.} 24. Bxb7+ {! Wins a pawn if he captures with his king, if he captures with his knight then Re8+ Nd8 Rxd8+} Kxb7 {He sees the line and chooses his king.} 25. Qxd8 f3 26. g3 {Much better than capturing as then he'd be able to do some annoying checks.} Qh3 {! I'm going to give him this for even threatening mate when he's this far behind. In fact, I was kind of worried here as I didn't see a way to stop it. I found a mate though.} 27. Qd5+ {Even if there weren't a mate I could take his pawn.} Kc8 28. Re8# {Mate. I felt this was a fun game, even if I didn't play great. Please comment and rate.}
