1. e4 {What else?} f6 {I decided on this on the principle of why not, nothing else has worked against her.} 2. d4 {Quickly forming an ideal center.} e5 {I knew that the opening called Caro-Kann was OK for Black, and this is just a mirror reflection, so I should be fine, right?} 3. dxe5 {She exchanges...} fxe5 {...and I complete the exchange.} 4. Qh5+ {Uh-oh. Maybe I wasn't right.} Ke7 {4...P-N3 costs me a Rook after 5 QxKP ch, so that's out...} 5. Qxe5+ {She plays QxKP ch anyway... at least I'm only out a Pawn...} Kf7 {H'mmm... I doubt my King will survive.} 6. Bc4+ {Activating a new piece.} Kg6 {Oh well...} 7. Qf5# {She does it again. I smile wanly and shake my head.}
