[Opening "English (A17), Queens Indian formation"]

1. c4 {always the english with gg52 and we always have close games} Nf6 {a decent response, staking a claim for d5} 2. Nc3 {further control of the d5 sq} e6 {opening for the B and the Q covers the N} 3. Nf3 {he's thinking about Bg2 and 0-0} c5 {a good symmetrical response, but it blocks the B.  Next is Nc6} 4. g3 Nc6 5. Bg2 d5 {this is provocative, rather like the sicilian p exchange.  he can't let me occupy that sq.} 6. cxd5 Nxd5 {This is good for Black, though I can't fall further behind in developing.} 7. O-O Be7 8. d4 c4 9. Bd2 a6 {simply to keep out the N and thinking of b5 and pressure on the Q-side} 10. Re1 {he's hoping to open that file and that makes me nervous} O-O {safety first} 11. e4 {to eject the N and partially open a line for the R.  I can't just retreat..} Nxc3 12. Bxc3 {overall, white is better:  more center control and better piece coordination.  I need to straighten myself out} b5 {starting the push and improving my pawn skeleton} 13. Nd2 {he wants to develop his Q} Bb7 {of course, now d4 is hanging, but development is important, not to mention contesting the long diagonal} 14. Qg4 {there's a solid threat there with the B and Q aiming at g7} Nxd4 15. e5 {this attacks both the N and B but clogs his own B's diag.  This pawn has quite a showing later on.  Nc2 does fork, but the threat of Bxb7} Bxg2 {This is ok, but Qc7 or Rb8 gets more pieces working.  Even 15...Bd5 ( that all important sq) keeps the light-sq B on the board.  just being a pawn up isn't an excuse to trade everything in sight} 16. Kxg2 Nc2 {the fork is always good, but still the Q's doing nothing.   Maybe 16...Qd5+ and then ...Rd8} 17. Ne4 Nxa1 {I missed his classy threat here.  Taking the a-rook, thinking he'd take right away, effectively undeveloping.  but possibly f5, but then 18 exf6 Bxf6 19 Nxf6+ Kh8 20 Qh5 h6 or 20...gxf6 21 Rxe6! and this is getting ugly for black} 18. Nf6+ {now, the forcing sequence} Bxf6 19. exf6 {It's mate next move if Qxg7.  I go with an earlier thought} Qd5+ {it's sad but this is the first time I've moved the queen.  the black a-rook doesn't budge.  poor play for black overall} 20. f3 g6 {the only prevention.  this opens holes in the fortress, the rooks aren't doing anything and the N is out to pasture.  I have got to turn things around} 21. Qh4 {thinking 22. Qh6 then mate} Nc2 22. Qh6 Nxe1+ {more or less trying to take some control} 23. Kh3 {that's the big mistake.  just Bxe1} Qh5+ {Now, I'm in control, even if only by luck} 24. Qxh5 {forced.  after 24...gxh5, white has no endgame hopes.  but the fact remains that he deserved to win.  Black's forces needed to be better mobilized.  alas, most games are lost, not won}
