1. Nf3 {This was a Gameknot game I played.} d5 2. g3 c5 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. d4 {She turns it into a reversed Grünfeld Defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence I would have preferred a reversed King's Indian Defence  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence } Nf6 5. O-O e6 {I am playing one of the quieter ways of handling it.} 6. c4 {I suspect we are both using opening databases.} dxc4 7. dxc5 Qa5 {I thought I may give her more problems with the queens on.} 8. Qc2 Bxc5 9. Qxc4 {so we both have recaptured the pawns.} O-O {We are coming to the end of the opening databases, and Gameknot post-match computer seems to think we both start making mistakes...} 10. e4 {This seems a reasonable move, seizing territory, but Gameknot computer  prefers 10. Bd2 } e5 {and this seems reasonable, stopping the pawn from advancing again, but Gameknot computer prefers … b6 } 11. Nc3 {And here the Gameknot computer likes 11. Bd2} Be6 {I didn't think I had any advantage here, and the Gameknot computer agrees.} 12. Qe2 Rfd8 13. Bg5 Bg4 14. Bxf6 {I wasn't too afraid of my pawns being doubled - I felt on an open board like this, the bishops are better than knights and the doubled pawns give an element of central control. In particular e5 is protected by a pawn now.} gxf6 15. Nd5 {This is a good move, forcing me to defend.} Kg7 {Like so. I now have a threat of Nd4. } 16. Qe1 {Which she neatly side-steps. } Qxe1 {So I take the queens off. } 17. Rfxe1 {She takes back.} Rac8 {I centralise the other rook, wondering how on earth I'm going to win this....} 18. Rec1 Nd4 {I advance my knight.} 19. Nxd4 {She takes.} Bxd4 {I take back.} 20. Nc3 {And this retreat is the start of her problems, after the exchange she is left with weak isolated pawns on the queen-side and my rook can penetrate to the second rank. Clear advantage to black now. I would guess she was afraid that 20. Rab1 would lose a pawn, as I could exchange rooks and take on b2, but then her rook goes to the 7th rank and is very active - she would have had enough compensation for the pawn.} Bxc3 {So I take.} 21. bxc3 {She takes back.} Rd2 {I invade.} 22. Rab1 {She counter-attacks b7} b6 {So I deal with that threat.} 23. a4 {Presumably trying to exchange off weak queen-side pawns.} Ra2 {So I attack it.} 24. f3 {She hits my bishop.} Bd7 {I attack the pawn again.} 25. a5 {She pushes again.} Rxa5 {I take. I am a clear pawn up, but not only that my pieces are in dominating positions.} 26. f4 {Trying to exchange pawns, or close down the king side - restrict my bishop in some way.} Kf8 {I decide to centralise my king. } 27. Rcd1 {She attacks my rook.} Ke7 {Gameknot computer doesn't like move and prefers Bg4 attacking his rook. Fritz likes Bg4 or Rc7.} 28. Rbc1 {And it doesn't like this move either. The reason was white could now do some exchanging - rook takes bishop, king takes back, then bishop check on h3 and white wins the exchange back. Normally when material down, a side wants to exchange pawns but not pieces, but this position is an exception. White's bishop is a bad bishop, blocked in by the pawn on e4. We will see later exactly how bad it becomes..} Rac5 {Black piles up on c3.} 29. Rd3 {White defends.} b5 {Threat - b4 winning another pawn. } 30. Rcd1 {Threatening the bishop.} Bg4 {White counter-attacks.} 31. Ra1 Rc8c7 32. h3 Bc8 33. Ra3 a6 {White is still in the game. the Bc8 has limited scope.} 34. f5 {And even less now.} Rd7 35. Re3 Rd1+ 36. Bf1 Bb7 37. Kf2 Rc8 38. h4 Rcd8 39. Kg1 {This is a dreadful move, allowing black to obtain an overwhelming position.} Rd8d2 {No neither white king nor white bishop can move.} 40. g4 {This is a slight error. better c4 immediately.} h6 {To stop any more advances of the king side pawns. } 41. Rb3 {Again, c4 immediately was called for. } Kd6 {This is a mistake. Better was Rc1 or Rc2 to prevent c4.} 42. c4 {so the break comes.} Bc6 {I break the pin on the b file.} 43. Rba3 Kc5 44. Rxa6 bxc4 45. Ra7 {This is another mistake. White hasn't got the time to be chasing after the king side pawns. Best was Rc3.} Kd4 46. Rg3 c3 {This pawn is coming!} 47. Rc7 {Computer thinks Rxc3 is better, but it is academic, this position is lost. I am not sure there is any need to comment on the rest.} c2 48. Rxc6 c1=Q 49. Rxc1 Rxc1 50. Rg2 Rdd1 51. Rf2 Kxe4 52. Kg2 Rdxf1 53. Rxf1 Rxf1 54. Kxf1 Kf3 55. Kg1 Kxg4 56. Kg2 Kxh4 57. Kf3 Kg5 58. Ke4 Kg4 {and white, about to lose the last pawn throws in the sponge.  Many thanks for reading.
