[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 {So, it starts with the most typical opening.} d6 {I do not know why chicoboy only advanced the pawn one square.  If I were black, I would have played 1...c5 because my favorite is still the Sicilian.  Just as good are 1...e5 (the King's Pawn Game) or 1...d5 (which becomes the Scandinavian Defense.) } 2. Nc3 {This, however, is still a standard move and lesplay does not have to meet any changes, yet.  I also would have played this, if I were white.  In this position, white is already starting to develop.  } e5 {This is a developing move because it develops a central pawn.  But, the e pawn is usually developed on the first move, unless you get into a QG or Benonni variation.  However, it is not too little or too late.} 3. d3 {?! I understand that white was also developing and wanted to get his DSB out.  But, this is the first inaccuracy.  Better was 3.d4 which virtually forces an exchange with 3...exd4, 4.Qxd4.  This move, however, is going to restrict his LSB, so that it is restricted to the second rank.  Or, he has to make several moves to get his f2 bishop out, when it should only take one.  This is why it is not a good idea to block your own pieces.} Nf6 {I like black's thought process here.  Chicoboy is continuing to develop in an attempt to get all of his pieces out, and this is a good way to do that.} 4. Nf3 {This is standard.} Bg4 {Another standard move which I understand quite well.  Not only does black develop, but this move pins white's queen.  I am also the kind of person that likes to pin N's to Q's or N's to K's.} 5. Be2 {Ok, I know where lesplay is going.  Not only does white decide to break the pin, but this will get him ready to castle on his next move.} Nc6 {This move is ok and it develops.  But, if I were black, I would have played 5...Be7 so that I could castle on my next move.  As we will see later on, however, chicoboy is not going to castle Kingside, but rather, Queenside.  This should make for an interesting game because both players will castle on the opposite wings.} 6. O-O Qd7 {I do not know why black brought his Q out this early.  Better was to continue developing with 6...Be7, or 6...0-0.} 7. Qd2 {So, the same thing could be said for white, but in a different sense.  Better was to bring the DSB out for development.  This move, however, blocks his B, so black is now ahead in development.} d5 {Ok, this is standard.  I know that black is hoping for an exchange, and this kind is very common.  And, black is going to be successful in exchanging material.} 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. Ne4 {So, lesplay decides to avoid another exchange.  But, if I were white that exchange would have occurred.  Note: I like exchanges when I'm ahead or material is level. } f5 {! I like this move a lot for two reasons.  First, black is developing another central pawn.  Second, it attacks whites N.} 10. Nc3 O-O-O {! This is what I mean when I talk about castling on opposite wings.  Normally, I prefer to castle Kingside, but in this position, chicoboy made the right choice.  Had black castled short, there would be a whole around his K making it vulnerable.} 11. a3 {I do not know why white played this.  However, this move is not going to stop black from exchanging material.} Nxc3 12. Qxc3 Re8 {In addition, I do not know why chicoboy moved here.  Better was to get the DSB out as it completes development.  Note: One of the main goals in an opening is to, "develop, develop, develop", as schakertjie puts it.  Sometimes, the player has very good reason for not developing, but this is not one of them.} 13. Qd2 {I do not know why lesplay made this retreat.  First, the Q was not attacked.  Second, it would have been better for him to bring out the DSB for development.  With that in mind, I think that black now has another small advantage.} Nd4 {In this position, black wants to exchange, and he is going to be successful.} 14. Nxd4 exd4 15. f3 {! At first, I wasn't sure why lesplay played.  I thought that better was to exchange with 15.Bxe2, Qxe2.  A second look at the position proves that I am wrong, and this is actually the best move, in this position.  That's because chicoboy would get a free piece because of the e8 R which I forgot about.  If black retook with 15...Qxe2??, 16.Rxe2.  So this move was absolutely necessary to protect his LSB.  So with that in mind, black now has a bigger advantage, given that there's a whole around white's K.  As a result, lesplay must be very careful to stay in the game.} Bh5 {Black's only retreat for now, but that is not a big deal especially because it won't stop him from developing.  I have had forced retreats like this, in several games against Jack Stockel.} 16. Rb1 {I do not know why lesplay moved here.  Better was 16.Qg5.  This way the Q cannot get attacked and he can find a perfect outpost to develop his DSB.} Qd5 {At first I had no clue as to why black moved his Q, but it makes perfect sense now.  In this position, he wants to win white's R.} 17. Ra1 {While this move protects it, better was to advance one of his pawns from the a-c rank.  So, something like 17.b3.  But, with this move, lesplay just keeps moving his a R back and forth, so he is wasting tempii.} Qe5 {! I understand chicoboys intentions.  In my mind it is an extremely good move and near extraordinarly brilliant.  Black is playing extremely well and has not made any mistakes, yet.  However, this is his best move of the entire game, so far.  Not only is he attacking white's piece, but lesplay is now going to have an extremely difficult time completing development after he protects his B.} 18. Re1 Bd6 {! And now, black's development is complete!  In addition, he is threatening mate in one, which is going to delay white's development even more because it is actually quite difficult to get out of this situation.  In other words, it's a complicated threat, as opposed to, unsound.  } 19. g3 {White's only move.  And, with that in mind, black is now winning.} h6 {I do not know why chicoboy played this.  Although there is nothing wrong with this move, in my opinion, 19...g4 was slightly as it plans out another difficult attack against white.  Note: it's now safe to attack since black is completely.  The only question is, how easy would it have been for lesplay to pick up on black's intention?} 20. b3 {! Ok, this is one of white's better move.  So far, he is not playing poorly but is still behind on development.  However, that is going to change with this move.  Why?  Everything will be developed, after he fianchettos his DSB.  And, that is his intention.} Rhf8 {! I really like this move.  While it may not make sense to everyone, chicoboy decided to do more then just connect his Rooks.  He doubled them up, and that will usually give black another big advantage.  So, most of the time, it is considered to be a very good move.  Why?  Because doubled rooks not only gives you protection, in the long run, but can pose as a dangerous threat against the opposing player.  Jack Stockel told me that you should double up your rooks, if possible.} 21. Bb2 {Like I said earlier, white's development is now complete.} f4 {?! At this point, black wanted to exchange and hopefully get a mating threat.  But, what would happen if white decided to make the exchange?  Then, if black retook he would start losing material, and this is where calculation becomes important.  So, this is chicoboy's first inaccuracy.  Note: This is why, at one point, I only looked at things move by move.  If I tried too much at once, I would start going wrong by miscalculating, and this is a perfect example.  What could have happened was 21.gxf3, Qxf3.  But then, 22.Qxf3, Bxf3, or 22...Rxf3 and everything is even.  Right now, I'd say that black is winning, but if that exchange had occurred, chicoboy might have turned a winning position into a drawn position.  Luckily, however, lesplay decides to decline the exchange by attacking black's LSB.} 22. g4 Bg6 23. c4 {? I do not know why lesplay moved here, but it is a big mistake.  White did not count on the fact that black can make an en-pessant capture 23...dxc3 e.p.  After that, white would be in a lot of trouble.} h5 {However, white is lucky because black misses the opportunity.  Instead, chicoboy decides to play this in an attempt to exchange. } 24. Bf1 {?! At first, I did not know why lesplay played this, but the problem with this move is that it undevelops.  And, the reason for doing so is not very good.  As it turns out, white is attempting to win black's Q, in this position.  Here's a thing, however, black's Q is not pinned.  So, this is an example of unsound aggression because the threat is straight forward and very easy to defend against, as we are about to see.  } Qg5 25. Red1 {?? I understand this move very well.  In this position, lesplay decides to bring his R right under the Q, to put pressure on the d file.  But, it's too little, too late.  In addition, this is the losing blunder because it gives away a free pawn, and there will be no compensation for the loss.  There is, however, more to this then meets the eye.  This move exposes white's K, so black will be able to set up a mating threat.  Now, the threat involves a mating net, and it will be virtually impossible for white to defend against it.  At this point, I would consider resigning, if I were white.  Right now, resignation is premature, but that is about to change.  } hxg4 26. Bxd4 gxf3+ {And, the threat starts here.} 27. Kh1 {This is best.  Also feasible was 27.Bg2, but then 27...Bxg2, which gives away a free piece, at the very least.  However, like I said earlier, the game is lost for white.} Rfh8 {!! After white get's out of check, black makes another threat.  And, it is part of chicoboy's plan to mate white, so this move is brilliant because it will eventually make it impossible for white to defend against the threat.  That's because black is coordinating and mobilizing all of his pieces to set lesplay up for disaster.} 28. Qf2 {At this point, white wants to compensate for his lost pawn, but his plan is not going to work, as I mentioned earlier.  That's because black is going to force another exchange, as we will see shortly.  Note: an exchange will really benefit chicoboy, this time, since he is ahead.} Be5 {And, this is how black does it.} 29. Bxe5 Rxe5 30. Rde1 {? But, white now wants to exchange.  However, that is a bad idea for two reasons.  First, lesplay is behind.  Most importantly, chicoboy has mating threats, so exchanging material is less important then focusing on the threats.  In fact, this is going to make things easier for black because white will have less material to defend against the threat.} Rxe1 31. Rxe1 Qg3 {And, chicoboy is determined not to give white any chances of counterplay.  This will force an exchange, and lesplay cannot with his h2 pawn because of black's remaining rook.  Not only that, but black reconnects his pawns after 32...fxg3.  That's important because Mr. Stockel told me that allowing your opponent to undouble his or her pawns will get you into a lot of trouble.} 32. Qxg3 fxg3 33. Bg2 {?? I understand that lesplay wanted to defend against the mating net, but I don't know why he played this, as opposed to, 33.Kg1.  This move loses immediately.  The game was already lost for white, but this ends the game instantly, as we are about to find out.} Rxh2+ {This is one of the consequences of white's last move.  First, white lost another pawn.  Second, 33.Bg2?? also gives away a piece, in addition to the pawn.  That's because after 34.Kg2 (forced), Rg2+.  Finally, although it is not immediate, mate is inevitable and around the corner because black is going to deliver mate with his R, LSB, f and g pawns.  Lesplay saw all of this and resigned.  Overall, both players did extremely well for themselves.  But, white went wrong by giving away a free pawn, and that was his first blunder.   It proves that only one blunder can make or break a game. }
