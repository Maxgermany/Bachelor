1. e4 d6 {Pirc defense - thematic game} 2. d4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {Common line} 4. Nf3 a6 5. Bc4 {White quitly reinforces his center} e6 6. O-O {white king in safe} b5 {In the pirc, black, usually attacks white' kingside} 7. Bd3 Ne7 {preventing 8.d5} 8. Be3 {to prepare a ba√Øonnet attack} Nd7 {To prepare a further c5} 9. Qd2 {White masses a huge amount of material in the center} O-O {This could have wait, 9. c5 or 9. Bb7 might  have been better but I was afraid of 10. Bh6} 10. Ne2 {To open the diagonal for the queen and/or prepare  a further Nf4} c5 {I estimate that it's hard time to attack the queenside as the many pieces white has but d4 is overprotected.} 11. c3 {providing an escape for the LSB} Bb7 12. Bh6 {Now comes the bayonet attack} d5 {Black attack had better to be strong because of the many troops, white has massed toward the black king} 13. e5 {Closing the game.} c4 {I didn't see what else I could do. It closes the game but white is better on the center and has all his lesser pieces and the queen aiming at black's  castle} 14. Bc2 {White plaid very well until now and has positionnal advantage} f6 {!? I felt cramped and thought, I had to do something. It's a mistake of course? Maybe due to lack of patience...} 15. exf6 Rxf6 {At least, the pawn exchange has released pressure on f6} 16. Bg5 Rf7 17. Nf4 {White attacks} h6 {mistake, black is in trouble} 18. Bxe7 Qxe7 {This } 19. Nxg6 Qd6 {The black king is weak and black is in late of material. The 2 good things are  that black has a better control on the center and can quickly bring all his reserves to protect the king.} 20. Rfe1 {Adding pressure} Nf8 {Black has to bring as many pieces as possible to protect the king.} 21. Nfe5 Rf6 {To fire the g knight} 22. Re3 {The rook will soon come to g3 or h3} Bc6 {So that the a rook can come on a7 to protect g7} 23. Rg3 Be8 {One more piece toward g6} 24. Nf4 {Some more air but black is still besieged} Ra7 {protecting g7} 25. Nh5 {Blunder.} Bxh5 {Now black is no longer in late of material but still besieged} 26. f3 {It's Verdun ! And to break the siege, the Allied drove a strong attack on the Somme.} Rb7 {So that I plan a counterattack on the right wing to force white to remove his LSB from the b1 h7 diagonal} 27. a3 {White defends the queenside} a5 {Carrying on the attack} 28. b3 cxb3 {To force the LSB to leave the diagonal} 29. Bxb3 Ng6 {Black's plan is now to get rid of the dangerous e knight } 30. Qe3 {Protecting the knight} Ne7 {menacing 31. Nf5 with fork attack on both rook and queen} 31. Bc2 {But the bishop is back ! The counterattack failed} Kf8 {king off the g file and on a black square} 32. Rh3 {to attack the unprotected bishop} Bg6 33. Bd1 {The LSB is away !} Nf5 {Now, black's counters} 34. Qf4 h5 {The situation is very complicated now but black has massed almost all his pieces in front of his king and white is outnumbered. In the following trade, black will probably lose some material but black is in advance and firing the e knight is worth a pawn.} 35. Nxg6+ {Beginning of a massacre} Rxg6 {first trade} 36. Qxd6+ Nxd6 {second trade} 37. Rxh5 {Now white is only one pawn down but black's position is better } Rc7 {Attaking the unprotected pawn} 38. Rc1 b4 {If the c pawn falls, the d pawn will follow and black will get one passed pawn.} 39. axb4 axb4 40. Ba4 {I didn't understand the point of this move} Rxc3 {The pawn is taken!} 41. Rxc3 bxc3 {Black will get 2 passed pawns} 42. Bc2 {Attacking the rook and blocking the passed c pawn} Rh6 {In this position and with material advantage, I estimate that the trade was valuable for black} 43. Rxh6 Bxh6 {White's d pawn can wait, it is doomed anyway} 44. Kf2 Nb5 {To attack the d pawn and prevent the king to come on help} 45. Ke2 Nxd4+ {Fork attack} 46. Kd3 Nxc2 {The trade seems to be good for black} 47. Kxc2 d4 {Now the white king has to stay on d3 or e2} 48. h4 Be3 {The pawns must be attacked from behind} 49. g4 Bf2 {White is doomed, } 50. h5 Be3 51. Kd3 Kg7 {White resigns here, for he is almost in zugzwang (he can only play Kc2 or Kd3 cannot prevent the black king to come on g3 and take the pawns one by one}
