1. d4 {This first move is fine, opening up line for the Bishop and Queen, and staking a claim to the e5 and c5 squares.} d5 {and Black replies with the same, another sound move.} 2. c3 {This is quite playable, although not as aggressive as c4.} Nf6 {another sound developing move by Black.} 3. Nd2 {After putting the pawn on c3, this is now the best square for the White Queen's Knight.} Nc6 {Although this is a sound developing move by Black, it does somewhat block the Black c pawn. I would prefer g6, c5 or e6 here for Black.} 4. c4 {This move does not fit well with White's second and third moves. If White wanted the pawn on c4 she should have put it there on her second move. It also leaves the White d pawn unprotected.} Nxd4 {Which Black duly takes.} 5. Nb3 {I'm not convinced this is best move either. Instead of Nb3 I would play e3 attacking the Knight on d4. After the Knight moves, White can play N(g1) to f3 and start to develop her King side pieces with a view to playing O-O and getting her King to safety.} Nc6 {Black retreats the Knight although NxN(b3) was a reasonable alternative.} 6. c5 {At the irsk of repeating myself, e3 was better.} e5 {Black now has quite a dominating centre, with pawns on d5 and e5 controlling c4, d4, e4 and f4 squares. If I were Black I would be very happy with this position!} 7. e3 {White finally gets round to making a move to develop the King side!} Be7 8. f4 {It is the right idea to strike at the Black centre, but this is a bit premature. It is better to develop some pieces first, say Bb5 followed by Ne2 and O-O then play f4.} e4 {This advance weakens Black's proud centre! Black no longer controls d4 and if I were White I would be thinking in terms of Ng1-e2-d4, perhaps combined with Bb5 to put pressure on Black Knight on c6.} 9. Qc2 {White comes up with another plan, playing the Nb3 to d4. However first the pawn on c5 needs protecting from the Black Bishop on e7.} Bf5 {Another sound developing move by Black.} 10. Nd4 {I'm not so happy about this plan though, as after the exchange of Knights on d4, the Black pawn on e5 is passed, that is to say there are no pawns preventing it from marching forward and queening. Although in the middle game this would not be possible, it would be a great asset to Black in and ending. Also White has to watch for Black playing e4-e3 and simultaneously attacking White's Queen on c2 with the Black Bishop on f5. I would say it would be better to play the Knight on g1 to e2 and then if Black exchanges Knights on d4 to recapture with a Knight.} Nxd4 11. exd4 O-O {Black has now completed the development of the minor pieces and castled, while White has exchanged the only minor piece she developed. Still, the the centre closed, and no open files to operate on, White has still a reasonable position, except being a pawn down.} 12. Bd2 {A sensible developing move.} Bg4 {I'm not sure why Black played this.} 13. Be2 {White again makes a good developing move. If Black take on e2 she can recapture with the Knight.} Bf5 {Black retreats, which may have been the best move, but now Black has wasted two moves.} 14. Nh3 {White develops the Knight to the only square available. However Black could just take it and leave White's King side pawns isolated and weak. In compensation White would have the open g file against the Black King, but I would prefer Black's chances.} Re8 {Black continues to develop, but it is unclear whether or not the Rook is really better on e8 rather than f8. Exchanging on h3 and then playing Qd8-d7 looks better. How on earth would White save the pawn on h3 in that situation?} 15. O-O-O {White castles on the Queen side. A bold move, and probably the correct decision, although I feel Nf2 first was perhaps even stronger. After O-O-O White could then attack on the King side with h3, g4 etc.} c6 {Black wants to open up files on the Queen side to attack the White King. This is the right strategy. B6 can't be played immediately as white would then keep the Queen side closed by playing c5-c6, so Black prevents this.} 16. Qb3 {White needs to counter-attack on the King side. She sees this and starts to manoeuvre her Queen over, and simultaneously protects the Knight on h3 to stop her King side pawns from becoming weak. It is the right idea, but Nf2 followed by g4 would have been a better way of doing this.} Qc7 {I can't see much wrong with b6 immediately, opening lines on the Queen side.} 17. Qg3 {So off to the King side the White Queen goes. Nf2 and g4 first was still better.} b6 {Black starts to open up the Queen side.} 18. Qh4 {White moves the queen round to a more threatening position, and now g4 can be played next move, if given a chance. If she plays N(h3)-g5, Black at the moment has h7 defended adequately.} Bxh3 {So Black exchanges, so if g4 does come, it doesn't threaten the Bishop on f5. As Black has all the pawns on the King side on the second rank, i.e. f7, g7 and h7, it will be harder for White to open files on the King side than Black to open files on the Queen side. Still, castling on opposite sides was probably the best strategy for White, as she was a pawn down, and would probably have lost if she had castled on the same side. Castling on opposite sides is a good way to randomise the position and increase the chances of a swindle!} 19. Qxh3 {So White recaptures.} bxc5 {And Black continues to open up the Queen side.} 20. dxc5 {White recaptures.} Bxc5 {And Black grabs a second pawn.} 21. f5 {White advances with the f pawn. Advancing the King side pawns is the best strategy, although I prefer g4.} Reb8 {So Black starts to mobilise to use the open b file.} 22. b4 {Oh dear! White loses a pawn and opens up the position even more on the Queen side. One could hardly hope for a more co-operative opponent! When defending, as White is doing on the Queen side, as a general rule it is better to keep the pawns on the second rank, i.e. in this position on a2 and b2 unless forced to advance them. I would prefer Bc3 in this position, defending the b2 pawn, and threatening taking the Black Knight on f6 in some variations.} Bxb4 {So White goes 3 pawns down.} 23. Qg3 {This is actually a fine move by White, if followed up with Bh6, to threaten mate on g7. Black would be forced to play g6 and then there are chances of opening up the Black King side with pawn h2-h4-h5 and exchange on g6. Black still would have an advantage, but White would have chances if Black wasted time.} Qa5 {Black also mobilises the Queen against the White King. The a2 pawn is now a goner, as if White tries to defend with say Kb1, Kb2 or Qb3 Black has B(b4)xd2. White's King is starting to look very bare. The position is basically lost for Black. B(d2)xB(b4) is probably the only way to prolong the game.} 24. Qe5 {Is she trying to defend with the Queen along the long black diagonal? If so, unfortunately Black finds a neat way to finish White off.} Ba3+ {Good move, well done Black!} 25. Kc2 {Forced, unless White wants to give her Queen away for nothing with Qb2.} Qa4+ {Another good move from Black!} 26. Kc3 {This time definitely forced! But now Bb2 is mate! So, an interesting game. Both players at times wasted time. Both players seemed to understand that if you castle on opposite sides, you must attack your opponent's King. Black won this game, because he had an extra pawn or two going into the middle game, he attacked more effectively, and although White correctly tried to muster a King side attack, also played the dreadfully weakening 22. b4? Please add your comments, and don't forget to rate my annotation please!}
