1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. e3 e6 {Good steady play so far!} 4. c4 dxc4 5. Bxc4 {That exchange give up your center pawn formation!} Ne4 {This move represents moving the same piece two times in the opening. You should focus on development of another piece this early in the game. For example Nc6 Be7or Bd7.} 6. Nc3 {Bb4 would pin the kn, develop the bishop and put your King in a position to castle. Exchanging kn represents the thrrid move of one piece in 6 moves.} Nxc3 7. bxc3 Nc6 8. O-O Bd6 {White is a great position with the development of rook via castle. Control of the center is slowly moving her way.} 9. Re1 O-O {Castle is perhaps the best move for you at this time.} 10. Ne5 Ne7 11. Bd3 Nd5 12. Bb2 Qf6 13. Qc2 {At this pt. white has every thing heading your directions.} Qh4 {I think Bishop x kn is better reduce some of the fire power heading your way and win you a pawn after recapture dxBd5. This make room of whites Bishop onb2 if white moves c4 but Qe7....then knf6 gave a better position. If you get the kn to f6 that take away the bishop sac on h7} 14. Nf3 Qg4 15. Bxh7+ Kh8 16. Ne5 Qh4 17. Be4 Nxe3 {Kn back to f6 would once again solid defensive position . Also you would have had two pieces attacking the white bishop.I don't think acapture of the kn was on white thinking, } 18. Rxe3 f6 19. Ng6+ Kg8 20. Nxh4 e5 21. Bd5+ Rf7 22. Bxf7+ Kxf7 23. Qg6+ Kg8 24. Rg3 Bd7 25. Qxg7# {}
