1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {So far a theoretical line in which both players are developing, preparing to castle, and controlling the center. Unless very tactical(Like some King's Gambit lines), we really don't need to calculate more than a few plies in any opening move. *The only things we need to calculate in any opening that is not super-tactical are 1.Safetiness of our move, which we need to always calculate 2.Attempts by either side to take the initiative/Take a major positional advantage. Other than this, use your positional understanding to guide you in those openings in which you are out of book. } 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 {So let's assume now, that we don't know any more theory, although there is more. But if someone does not know a move in the opening, they should treat it as a critical position and ask themselves the following*1.What is the static evaluation of this position?  2.Based on this evaluation, what is now my  short term goal?  3.What are the -set of moves- that go to my goal I just set(Try to make a clear order)?  4.Intuitively select the general plan/format that you would like to go for, and do it. *If there are many tactics in this opening, you can treat it as a middlegame position, and use the middlegame calculation skill, which is below.} 10. Nd5 f5 11. exf5 {This is now out of main theory, because this move is not best. Now we can say that we are in the "sharper" openings. The sharp opening is when you are out of theory, the position is definitely still an opening, and there are many tactical possibilities. Treat those positions as middlegames. You general goals in those positions will most likely be to resolve tactics and develop very quickly. By the way, 11.Bd3 Be6 is stronger, keeping the tension. Taking allows black easier development, and the open position does not necessarily favor white.} Bxf5 {Now that we are in an open position, the following calculational process is this.***Use it when there are tactics flying around, and the position is more imbalanced. 1.Based on the tactical motifs and positional imbalances, what is my goal?(Tactical motifs are any ideas that are tactical in nature and might be exploited. For example, a motif in this position might be the looseness of the black c6 knight and it's alignment to the king. If this was a serious motif to consider, a possible white goal would be to see if that might be exploitable.)Also, pay close attention to the opponent's move 2.What are ALL the forcing moves I have? Forcing moves include -Checkcaptures -Checks -Captures -Attacks. These are all candidate moves that need to be looked at first, since they are the most important. There may be a lot of these moves, but if they are bad, you can easily eliminate most in a few seconds, and you will not miss anything due to lack of consideration. To find these moves, look at all you pieces in order from Q,R,B,N,Pawn. King is only in sharp endgames. 3.What are now the logical candidate moves I can select based on my work in step 1? You are now thinking about how you can directly find a way to "think" before finding candidates. By now, you have mixed the Computer's thinking process and the Human's logical process, incorporating both of their strengths.  4.Look at all the moves, and eliminate all that are obviously bad. To avoid blunders *After each considered move, look at all of your opponent's forcing moves, and quickly see if they are winning or cause you major problems. 5.Calculate the remaining moves(The process will be desribed in my Previous Calculation article.) Evaluate the position most likely to happen after each move by best play, and decide which evaluation you think is best; Play that move. Let's try and use it for this game.} 12. c3 {Move does not do any tactical threats, and since there were none the previous move, we don't need to worry. We would like to develop our pieces, while there are no major motifs in the opponent's position. We do have a central majority, so we may also have ideas of taking the center control to advance our center. Thus, we can try to develop to control the center and get the white pieces to divert control of it. Candidates are ...Bg7, Rc8...Not too many. Bg7 seems logical actually, while Be7 is also OK. I did not check for the forcing moves in this position, but that is becausethe pieces are not clashing yet, and not threats are being made.} Bg7 {Certainly a move that correspondes to the goal.} 13. Nxb5 {(??)This move is definitely a concrete blunder, and is a simple miscalculation by the 1900+ player. This should lose the game or at least hand over a clear advantage to black. White should go with his goal of development, so Be2, Bd3 were all better, and also Nc2. White does get 2 pawns for the piece, but that is almost always easier to play for the side with the extra piece.} axb5 14. Bxb5 {If white had calculated this far, he may have seen that 14...Bd7 unblocks the pin right away, and black keeps the material. That should be enough to make white abandon this line, even if 14...Bd7 is not necessarily the best.} Rc8 {(?!)Black could have ended the nonsense with 14...Bd7 immediately, neutralizing the 2 pieces around his position. That also brings up a strategical point: 13.Nxb5 was bad strategically, since it just made an attack with 2 pieces. When looking at variations, look with a critical eye at those moves that attempt to break the fundamental strategical principles of chess.} 15. Nb4 Qb6 {(?)This move loses the black advantage. Can you find the right move? It should be simple with the process. 15...Bd7 16.Qxd6 Bf8 and black is still fine.} 16. a4 O-O 17. Bxc6 Rxc6 18. a5 Qb5 19. Nxc6 Qxc6 {The result of white's miscalculation and black helping along is that black is actually material down. However, his bishop pair should compensate fully. But black no longer has any advantage.} 20. O-O {Well, now this is a position in which all the pieces are developed, and time to start a concrete plan. The plan should be based on the imbalances. White has the queen side majority and passed pawns, so he would like to roll those forward. Black would like to take control in the center and also target the queenside pawns. } Rb8 21. a6 Ra8 22. a7 Be6 {(!)Strong move, and a good connector with the black plan.} 23. Re1 d5 {Right now, both sides are doing what their correct plan tells them to. Thus, no real mistakes have been made, and the game is very competitive.} 24. Qa4 Qb7 25. h4 {(?!)Now white plays a move that does not go with his plan. Not horrid, but a waster of a tempo.} Bf8 {Hangs a pawn, although there are complications if taken.} 26. g4 {(?)Now this is a serious mistake that destroys the white king cover, does not go with his correct plan, and thus is bad. In fact, it is so detrimental that white would have been better playing a "nothing move" like 26.Rf1.} e4 27. Qd4 Bg7 28. Qd2 Rxa7 {(?)Allows a very difficult to see combination by white to regain the pawn. This pawn is clearly not going anywhere. Black should take off the king cover with 28...Bxg4! with excellent winning chances.} 29. Rxa7 Qxa7 30. Rxe4 {(!)A strong move that gives white a fighting chance by eliminating the dangerous center pawns. Black still has an advantage, but he should be careful now. } dxe4 {(??)This is the moment in which black makes his greatest slip. The perpetual check is not difficult to see at all. The reason black played this was because the white player was rated so much higher, and he wanted a draw. This removes all the learning possiblities that could have happened by continuing play, and a win could have been possible for black. } 31. Qd8+ Bf8 32. Qg5+ Bg7 33. Qd8+ Bf8 34. Qg5+ Bg7 35. Qd8+ {That is the game. Instructive to see that even higher rated players don't have adequete calculational systems. Just follow the steps here and in my previous annotation about calculation, improve them, and you will improve quickly, because calculation and tactics are the most important things in chess.}
