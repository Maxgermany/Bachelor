1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. Qxd4 {My queen comes into play...} Nc6 4. Qe3 {...but must retreat.} b6 5. Nf3 {I bring up my knight in case my opponent unleashes his bishop.} h6 6. Nc3 Nb4 {He eyes up my c-pawn, and even my queen...} 7. Bd3 {...but I cover the c2 square.} c5 8. Nd5 {I attack the knight...} c4 {...my bishop is attacked by the pawn...} 9. Nxb4 {...but I remove the knight...} cxd3 {...at the expense of my bishop...} 10. Nxd3 {...but end up with the pawn.} Qc7 11. Qd2 {Now I decide I need to cover the square from a queen attack...} a5 12. Qc3 {...and attack her...} Qxc3+ 13. bxc3 {...and we exchange queens. I didn't know what I was doing then, as I have distorted my pawn structure.} Ba6 14. O-O d6 15. Be3 Nf6 16. Bxb6 {I snaffle another pawn...} Nxe4 {...but lose another...} 17. Rfe1 {...but manage to pin the knight down to its file...} d5 {...but I can no longer use the rook to remove the knight...} 18. Nd2 {...so instead, I bring one of mine to attack it, to ensure no net loss...} f5 {...but another pawn comes to protect the previous one.} 19. Nxe4 fxe4 {Now we exchange knights...} 20. Nf4 {...and my remaining one has to move out of the way.} Bc4 21. Ne6 {I eye up the rook in the far left-hand corner...} Kd7 {...but my opponent is wise to this...} 22. Nxf8+ {...but I steal his bishop...} Rhxf8 {...at the expense of my knight.} 23. Bd4 {I decide my pawn needs cover...} Rf7 {...and my opponent decides likewise for his pawn.} 24. Reb1 {I move this rook to keep its twin's pawn covered.} Ba6 {He covers the b7 square in case I decide to check...} 25. Bb6 {...so I attack his pawn again...} Bc4 {...and he moves his bishop to cover...} 26. Bd4 {...so I open up the b-file again.} g6 {This time he moves his g-pawn forwards...} 27. Rb7+ {...allowing me to check and therefore expose a rook...} Ke6 28. Rxf7 Kxf7 {...so we do a rook-for-rook exchange.} 29. f3 {I attack his pawn furthest forward...} Rb8 {...but he takes the open file...} 30. a3 {...so I push my far left-hand pawn up one, so the bishop can't attack it...} a4 {...he stops its progress...} 31. fxe4 {...and finally I remove the pawn on my fourth rank...} dxe4 {...but lose one in return...} 32. Re1 {...which is instantly lined up...} Rb2 {...as is my c2-pawn...} 33. Rxe4 {...but I create some space by removing his pawn on e4...} Rxc2 {...but I lose my c2 one.} 34. Be5 Bd5 35. Rxa4 {I remove the one on my far left, creating more space...} Rxg2+ {...but have to move here...} 36. Kf1 {...and I move here to avoid being trapped.} Ra2 37. Ra7+ Ke6 38. Bd4 Rxh2 {Now both our left-hand sides are open...} 39. Ra6+ {...so I check him again...} Kf7 40. Rf6+ {...and again...} Ke7 41. Rxg6 {...to create more space on my right.} h5 42. Rg5 Bb3 43. Rg2 {I line up the rook...} Rh1+ {...but he attacks my king...} 44. Rg1 {...so I block for a possible swap...} Bc4+ {...but he attacks me from another side...} 45. Kf2 {...so I stay close to my rook, although the bishop has it covered.} Rh2+ 46. Rg2 {I again go for the blocking move...} Rh3 {...but he declines to take it...} 47. Rg7+ {...so I attack his king once more...} Kf8 48. Rg3 {...and line up the rook again...} Rh1 49. Rg1 {...and again...} Rh2+ 50. Rg2 {...and again...} Rh3 51. Rg3 {...and again...} Rh1 52. Rg1 {...and again...} Rh4 53. Rg3 {...but keep it marshalled here. Putting mine on g3 made sure it couldn't escape and wreak havoc.} Re4 54. Re3 {I attack it again...} Rg4 55. Rg3 {...and again...} Re4 56. Re3 {...and again...} Rh4 57. Rg3 {...and cover again...} Rh1 58. Rg1 {...and replicate this position for a third time. Keeping the rook under control ensured that it couldn't get too far.}
