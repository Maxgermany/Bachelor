1. e3 {HI guys, this is another annotation by me, this was played with my friend, Luke. He's okay, except for some dumb mistakes he make.} e5 2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 e4 4. Ne5 {Whenever I have time, I send my knights up, because I think there might come a time when those pushed knights would be useful.} Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 {Unfortunately, that knight, I decided, was going to have a really bad day.} 6. Nxc6 Bxc6 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 {As you can see, knight and the bishop has been traded off.} 8. O-O {I castle, because I can.} Bb4 {Why? comment please.} 9. Qg4 {kinda wanted to get to g7, which would give me free rook.} Bxc3 10. bxc3 Qf6 {He saw through my tactics, and I return my focus to the four pawns that is just laying crunched up.} 11. Bb2 Nh6 12. Qe2 O-O {That castle becomes his doom.} 13. d3 Qd6 {Why? comment please.} 14. c4 Rab8 15. Rab1 f5 16. cxd5 {there begins the great pawn trade offs.} cxd5 17. dxe4 dxe4 {I would say pawn in f5 should have moved, because now I can check him.} 18. Qc4+ Rf7 {That move also contributes to his doom, although his intention might have been to protect g7and c7 pawns.} 19. h3 {This is a useful move, because knight cannot land on g4 now.} Qb4 {Got cravings for queen trade offs? } 20. Qd5 Qd6 21. Qd4 Qxd4 22. exd4 f4 23. f3 e3 {As you can see, now the queen are gone and everybody is extremely unhappy.} 24. d5 {I moved my pawns because I wanted Luke to make the first move.} Rb5 25. c4 Rc5 {He really messed things up. a lot.} 26. Ba3 {Luke didn't want to lose the rook, so he takes fairly costless looking pawn.} Rxc4 27. Rb8+ {Good bye Luke.} Rf8 28. Rxf8# {And boom goes the dynamite.  Kind of weird ending, I know. But he fell for it and I am extremely happy that he did. At least, now, one of us comes out with a smile on our face.}
