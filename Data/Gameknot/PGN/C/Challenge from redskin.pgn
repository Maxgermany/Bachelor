Ba4 {doing the only thing, White moves the bishop out of the way} Nd3+ {I move my knight into a catch 22 situation, king or bishop,} 7. Kf1 {White moves the king out of the way} Bc5 {rather than take the bishop I decide as my knight is safe for the next turn I'd bring my bishop into play for defence} 8. b4 {the pawn attacks my bishop, but won't be able to take it the next turn} Nxf2 {going for bigger fish I put a catch 22 on the rook and queen} 9. Qe1 {White moves the queen out of the way} Nxh1 {and I proceed to take the rook, I leave the knight here for the rest of the game, It is one of the factors of the whites loss} 10. Ke2 d5 11.

Nd3 {Like so} Qxh2 {I go on the offensive placing my queen ready for my next turn to check the white king} 13. bxc5 {leaving my bishop unprotected the white pawn takes it, this is whites second and last piece taken} Qxg2+ {I check the king} 14. Kd1 {unable to move anywhere else I force the king back into it's origin} Qxe4 {Threatening White queen with mine, I move mine back} 15. Bc2 {believeing I will not take his queen or giving it up for an attack of his own, White does not move his queen, but instead moves his bishop, for what I believe, to defend the knight If I attack it.} Ne7 {I get my knight into play} 16. Bb3 {with nothing else to do the bishop is moved back} Qxd3 {I take the knight now that it is undefended} 17. Ba2 h5 {I move to get my rook into position  NOTE: at this point the game is paused for a few hours due to white going offline} 18. Bb3 {after a few hours white comes back and moves his bishop} Bg4+ {after clearing my mind I see that I can check the king with my bishop forcing the only way of defence} 19. Qe2 {to move his queen in the way} Bxe2+ {I then take the queen, keeping it safe by my queen} 20. Ke1 {moving his King out of the way I am herding it into his checkmate position} Rh6 {I move to get my rook into position, Checkmate in 2 moves} 21. Ba4 {he mves his bishop, possibly ready to take my pawn as a last ditch to stall me} Rg6 {Checkmate in 1 move} 22. c4 {White moves pawn} Rg1# {Checkmate, King can move neither towards or away from the rook due to the rooks attack and bishops attack, nor can it move diagonally due to the knight I left at the begining  A great game.}
