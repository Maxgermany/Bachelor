1. e3 {I won this game, and it appears to me like a miracle, since I got out of the opening with a very inferior position. I made a quality sacrifice, and it came out to be correct, seeing the game's endind. But still, I am not satisfied.} e5 2. b3 d5 3. Bb2 Nc6 4. Nf3 Bg4 {I expected he will kick out my bishop. My plan is to play f6, and put the bishop in g6 or f7. It came out to be what actually happened. } 5. h3 Bh5 6. g4 Bg6 {If he goes on with h4, I would have replied with h5. I can bear his g5, and try to use his kinkside weakness (Bd6 or Qd6...)} 7. Bb5 f6 {It leaves me without the queen side castle, and the king side castle is threatened by the advanced pawns. Still, I thought I could assume this risk. } 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. Nh4 Bf7 10. Nc3 c5 {This is probably a mistake. I should develop my pieces, I know. Moreover, it leaves the b5 square to his knight. I wanted to increase my center force, and make the game unconfortable for him on the queenside. With c5 I exchange my doubled pawn, and if he takes it, the b column open "means" something to my play. } 11. Qe2 c4 12. O-O-O {This is his mistake, I think. I'm going to attack the queenside! He is looking for a kingside attack, so he wants to communicate his rooks and he thinks his king is safe, there. } c6 {More pawns moves! This was to free my queen. I am strongly behind in developement, I was aware of this!} 13. f4 {Here he goes with his kingside attack. } e4 {But the center is completely mine... I was fearing g5! If he does it, he would have got the initiative!} 14. Rhg1 {Just preparing it... time is running out. } d4 {More pawn's move! But I made some calculations. I have a surprising move in my sleeve. } 15. Nxe4 d3 16. cxd3 cxb3 {If I take back the pawn in d3, it is true I have it well placed, but the attack loses "steam", and it leaves the kingside to him. This one was the move I bet my game on! Brilliant, or a further mistake?} 17. a3 Qa5 18. d4 {Taking a3 inmediately was not too dangerous for white, so...} c5 {To open the c column was more interesting. From c5, my queen would have threatened a3 again...} 19. Nxc5 {But exchanging pieces leaves me without the balck squares' bishop, and I felt I should not lose it by any mean, since my other pieces are unactive. } Rc8 {Adding pressure.} 20. Kb1 {I can lose steam again. My rook on the c column can be easily exchanged with his, so I thought a lot, and decided to sacrifice. } Rxc5 21. dxc5 Bxc5 {I was thinking all the time how to get my white bishop to g6, but it was impossible without letting his knight to f5, so I had to go on in another way. } 22. d4 Bxa3 23. Bxa3 Qxa3 24. Qb2 {I foresaw this defence, and it seems to be enough for white to be safe. Still, I have the initiative until now. If rook c1, Kd7 stops it from giving check, and he cannot double them easily. } Qb4 25. Qc1 Ne7 26. Rd3 {Now, I was tempted by a7-a5. The two joined and free pawns are a great force. Still, it loses time and allows him to react. } Bd5 {Threatening and developing. } 27. Rc3 Be4+ 28. Kb2 Bc2 {I foresaw this move when I decided to move my bishop. It cuts his strengh on the c column and guarantee me at least I recover the quality. } 29. Rg2 Kd7 {Surprise again. The king himself would help to protect the c column, because the white queen is behind the rook.} 30. Rgxc2 bxc2+ {I saw that this way his own king is going to block his c column. } 31. Kxc2 Re8 {Since I can protect c7 with my subsequent move Nd5, I can add pressure. This move is better, I think, than rook b8 or Qa4 .} 32. Kd1 Nd5 {I was fearing Rc5. If he manages to carry his king into the king side, my only advantage is the a pawn. } 33. Rd3 {But he misses a tactic from my side...} Nxf4 {And the game is won. } 34. Rd2 Rxe3 35. d5 {His only hope: Qc6 , but...} Qa4+ 36. Qc2 Qa1+ 37. Qc1 Re1+ {Elementare, mio caro Watson...} 38. Kxe1 Qxc1+ {}
