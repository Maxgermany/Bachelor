1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {I wouldn't prefer this opening. You block your bishop and get little development.} 3. d4 {Attacking the center before he is allowed to develop.} exd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {Not a good move. It doesn't really do anything right now, and he still hasn't developed. Better was Nf6 or Nc6.} 5. Nc3 g6 {An okay move. But you know the saying, "Knights before bishops".} 6. a4 {I want to go Bc4, and this prevents b5. I still think I should have done something else, suppose Bf4 or f4.} Bg7 7. Bc4 {Got what I wanted.} c5 {Trying to get me a double pawn stack up. I found a move to prevent it.} 8. Nde2 Bxc3+ {Not a good move. He doesn't get me doubled pawns, and he has a whole where his bishop used to be. And as a quote, "I would give up if I lose my bishop when in a fiancheto."  } 9. Nxc3 Nf6 10. Bg5 {Pinning his knight.} h6 {Not so great. I found a move after this one, that wins a pawn.} 11. Bf4 O-O {Not a good move! He loses the pawn on h6.} 12. Bxh6 {I took this one first, because he could defend this one, but he still can't defend the one on d6. I'll get that one later.} Re8 13. O-O {I figured I could lose that pawn, and attack.} Nxe4 14. Nxe4 Rxe4 15. Qf3 {Terrible blunder I did!!!! I miscalculated!!!! I immediately thought I was going to lose. I had to decide if either Qd5 or Qf3 and I got off topic!!! Qd5, a total win. Qf3, a total loss.} Rxc4 16. Rfe1 {Trying to think of something. The only advantage I have is hat I have a bishop on h6 and he hasn't really developed.} Nc6 {He started developing.} 17. Re3 {Trying to double my rooks.} Rxc2 {Screw the pawn!!!! I need a plan!!} 18. Rae1 Ne5 {Nice move.} 19. Re3xe5 {I am so desperate to take the e file. Rawrrrrrrr!!!!!} dxe5 20. Rxe5 {He can't back rank mate me. I'm fine.} Rxb2 {Taking a pawn and threatening mate on b1.} 21. h3 {Making a hole.} Rb1+ {Don't know why he did this.} 22. Kh2 Be6 23. Qe4 {I have a plan. If he doesn't move right now, I take the bishop, and he can't take back otherwise mate on g6. Also attacking the rook on b1.} Rb4 {Noticing the plan, and the attack on the rook.} 24. Qc2 {I still want to keep on attacking the g6 pawn.} Rc4 {Trying to block.} 25. Qb2 {Another diagonal moving my rook will threaten mate.} Qd6 {Making a pin.} 26. f4 Qe7 {This move was a little too risky. I could come up with something. I can't take the bishop, then he takes it back with the pawn and his queen is protecting g7.} 27. Rf5 {This stops f6.} Rd4 {A great move.} 28. Bg5 {Trying something out.} Qd7 29. Rxc5 {Taking a pawn. He can't move the rook otherwise I'll mate.} Bxh3 {A move i missed. I cant take it otherwise I lose my queen.} 30. Bh6 {Continuing with a plan.} Bxg2 {Another move I missed. I have to defend the threat of Qh3.} 31. Rc3 {Blocking the h3 threat. I feel like giving up.} Qh3+ {And wow. I can't believe he blundered. Now I won.} 32. Rxh3 {He can't take the rook, or I'll take his.} Rad8 {Defending the rook.} 33. Rd3 {Rd3, and I finished him off. He cant take it, or move it, or defend it, because then i give him a mate.
