1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {Closed sicilian, my favourite.} d6 3. g3 Nc6 4. Bg2 g6 5. d3 Bg7 6. Be3 Rb8 {Kasparov's favourite response to closed sicilian.} 7. Qd2 b5 8. Nge2 Nd4 9. O-O e6 10. b4 {a3 more safe line . I figured the following sacrifice would be more interesting actually. The sacrifice doesnt have anything immediate threats but they will slowly arise in pretty forcing measures.  Black bishop is also pretty strong in this kind of opening so I didnt think it was that bad after all.} Nxe2+ 11. Nxe2 Bxa1 12. Rxa1 cxb4 {Correctly played by taking pawn. Other , less effective would be 12...Qc7 I checked the both outcomes before making my sacrifice. Probably doing some research of its possibility in closed sicilian later with help of stronger players. (12...Qc7 13.cxd 13...dxc 14.Qc3 14...e5 15.Bxc5 and here Bg4 with 16.Nf4 , Bd7 and most others with calm d4)} 13. Bxa7 Ra8 14. Be3 Ra4 15. Rb1 Qa5 16. e5 {Im not so sure about this move.But if declined by 16..d5 I would 17.Bc5 and pressure more with knight. But d4  and Nc1 seem to be other good choises. Dont see anything wrong with this though. 16.Bc6  and trade doesnt tempt since i cant send anything to attack.} dxe5 17. Bc5 b3 {Material exchanges would do good for black. Excellent move.} 18. Qxa5 Rxa5 19. axb3 Ra2 20. Rc1 b4 {What is this? :D   I sure was planning to go in Nc3 so black wanted to stop it forgetting my bishop...} 21. Bxb4 Kd7 22. Nc3 Ra6 23. Ne4 Ra2 24. Bf8 h5 {Rook is getting trapped as you soon will see. At any case, Nd7 develops the Knight, and lets rook out.} 25. Bg7 Rh7 26. Bxe5 h4 27. b4 hxg3 28. hxg3 Rh5 29. f4 Ke7 30. Bf3 Rh7 {Rh6 would have saved the rook since it doesnt let my knight on g5} 31. Ng5 Rh6 32. Bg7 f6 33. Bxh6 Nxh6 34. Ne4 Nf5 35. Kf2 {I regret pinning my own king and it results to tough endgame where draw is possibility.} Rb2 36. g4 Nd4 {He would anyway have my b4 pawn so I'd rather give the c pawn and activate king while locking his up there.} 37. Rh1 Nxc2 38. Rh7+ Kd8 39. Nxf6 Nxb4+ 40. Ke3 Nc2+ 41. Kd2 {41.Ke4 with 41...Bb7 of course...} Na3+ 42. Kc3 Rf2 43. Be4 Rxf4 44. g5 Nb5+ 45. Kc4 Ba6 46. Kc5 Nc3 47. Kd6 Nb5+ 48. Kxe6 Bc8+ 49. Kd5 Bf5 {Now its important to know the right moment of exchange.} 50. Rb7 Na3 51. Ke5 {regreful move, 51.Rb8! (51...Kc7 52.Rb3!) forces Bc8 which allows me to grab the pawn on g6.} Rf2 52. Kd6 Kc8 53. Rc7+ Kd8 54. Rg7 Nb5+ 55. Kc6 Nd4+ 56. Kd5 Nb5 57. Rb7 Na3 58. Bxf5 Rxf5+ 59. Kd6 Nb5+ 60. Kc6 Nd4+ 61. Kd6 Kc8 62. Rb4 Nb5+ 63. Kc6 Na7+ 64. Kb6 Kb8 65. Ka6+ Kc7 66. Rb7+ Kc6 67. Kxa7 Rxg5 68. Rb6+ Kc7 69. Ka6 {I originally calculated that it would get to draw after rook trade. But doesnt seem to after calculating more. However, this move serves also the checking thread Ra5 followed by Rc5 which is annoying.} Rg3 70. Nd5+ {Black resings.}
