1. b4 {The preferred computer line for black is 1... d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 Bf5 4. Nc3 e6 5. a3 a5 6. b5 Bd6 7. Be2 c5} c5 {White should play 2. bxc5 e5 (2... e6 3. d4) 3. e3 Bxc5 4. Nf3 d6 5. d4 which gives him a slight advantage.} 2. b5 { } d5 3. Bb2 { } d4 {3. ... a6 was better.} 4. c3 e5 5. cxd4 cxd4 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. e3 Nf6 8. exd4 e4 9. Ne5 O-O 10. Qb3 {10. Na3 with the intent of Bc4, O-O, Re1, Bb3 and Nac4 was better. } Be6 {Instead the computer likes  10... Nbd7 followed by Qe7.} 11. Bc4 {Best for black is 11... Bxe5 12. dxe5 Nfd7 13. O-O (13. Bxe6 Nc5 14. Bxf7+ Rxf7  is winning for black.) 13... Nc5 } Bxc4 12. Qxc4 {12. Nxc4 instead gives white a slight advantage. } Nbd7 {Instead 12. Nxc4 gives white a slight advantage. Here 13. O-O is necessary to get the king out of the line of fire, because Black can play dxe5 followed by Nc5 and Nd3+.  So 13. O-O Rc8 14. Qb3 Bxe5 15. dxe5 Nc5 16. Qg3 is equal.} 13. Qb3 {Now black is winning with 13... Bxe5 14. dxe5 Nc5, which according to the computer, gives black has a huge advantage.  However, understanding why this is winning is not easy.  This leads to many complicated lines linked to below.} Qc7 {Although this looks like a reasonable move, the previously stated 13... Bxe5 14. dxe5 Nc5 is much better.} 14. O-O {14. Nc4 is a little better. } Nxe5 15. dxe5 Bxe5 16. Bxe5 Qxe5 17. Nc3 {17. Na3 is a little better so as to later be able to go to c4, and to meet black's Ng4 with Qg3.} Rfd8 {17. ... Ng4 first is also good.  Here white could play 18. Qd1 to stop Ng4.} 18. Rad1 {Now Black is winning with 18... Ng4 19. g3 Qh5 20. h4 Ne5 which leads to a ton of complicated variations linked to below.} Rd3 {Although I was proud of this move, it misses the much better and very complicated Ng4.  Now 19. h3 is necessary to stop Ng4.} 19. Rfe1 {Black can still win with 19... Ng4 which also leads to some complicated lines linked below.} Rad8 {Now 20. h3 is necessary. } 20. Nxe4 {A time pressure blunder.  } Rxb3 {}
