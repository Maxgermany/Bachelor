1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3 Bc5 {White takes aim at f6, black at f3. } 4. h3 {This move likely telecasts his intention for a kingside attack, but it could be a weak move waiting to see how black develops.} O-O 5. Qf3 {Probably aiming for Bg5.} Nc6 6. c3 {This is quite common for when white plays an early Qf3.  He has to keep the knight off of d4, but this is the best square for the knight, so a rather indirect battle for the square ensues.} Bb6 {Black would like to pin the c pawn allowing the knight to slip into d4.} 7. b4 {White is not having it.  White is aiming to claim not only the kingside, but the queenside as well.} a5 {But black wants the pin.} 8. b5 {White forces the abandonment of d4, but there is a cost.  Black is rather well placed for a position like a King's Indian but with the dark-square bishop along the a7-f2 diagonal rather than placed on g7.} Ne7 9. a4 {I suspect this is a mistake, but white seems unsure how to proceed.} d5 {Plan 1 for black - Hit the center and take advantage of the vulnerable white king.  White is several moves away from castling kingside, and it appears that his king might be equally vulnerable there too.} 10. Bb3 {Options?  1, Open the center for attack.  2, Close the center and play along a position similar to the King's Indian.} d4 11. c4 {Just about forced as 11.cxd4 is met by Bxd4 and the white rook must move.} c5 {The black dark square bishop looks awkward, but this move effectively closes white's plan for queenside counterplay.} 12. Qg3 {White seriously underestimates the black threats possibly because of Bb6 and c5, but the moves had a purpose.} Qd6 {Black sees Bh6 coming so he plays a useful waiting move that allows him to delay Ng6.} 13. Bh6 Ng6 {And now the bishop has wasted a move.} 14. Bg5 Nh5 {Seemed worth a try, even though the move is easily dealt with.} 15. Qf3 {Expecting Nf6?} Nhf4 16. g3 Ne6 {Retreating with a threat.} 17. Bd2 f5 {I am not sure this is really offering a pawn as the pawn can probably be recaptured, but the idea has some bite.  White has no haven for his king.  Black is threatening to open up the f file.} 18. exf5 Nc7 {I played this move for two reasons, one, I expose the f pawn to the bishop's attack, and two, I prepare for the possibility that he finds a way to snake out of the pin with tempo.  The opponents style of play so far suggested to me that he would not take rook and knight for queen.} 19. Qe4 {A definite mistake.  The b pawn will prove insufficient compensation for the f pawn assuming that black does not play Rxf5.  Black likes Bxf5 because the queen has already moved twice without compensation.} Bxf5 20. Qe2 {Defensive.} e4 {!Black has a nasty tactic.} 21. dxe4 {Dubious at best.} Bxe4 {! If Qxe4, Re8(either rook) wins the exchange.} 22. f3 Bxf3 {In a typical King's Indian, the light-squared bishop is the sacrificial piece usually at h3.  Black is daring white to capture the piece.} 23. Qh2 Rae8+ {Increasing pressure, but black may be better off with Bxh1.} 24. Ne2 {The path to survival is as likely to be found in 24.Kf2 Bxh1+ 25.Bf4 when black still holds the advantage, but the path to victory is less clear.} Rxe2+ {Tempting was d3 squeezing the life out of the position, but with white's forces so uncoordinated, getting the queen off the board seemed to promise more more quickly.} 25. Qxe2 Bxe2 26. Kxe2 Qxg3 27. Na3 {Connecting his rooks.} Rf2+ 28. Kd1 Qxb3+ 29. Kc1 d3 {Pins the knight.  Black's queen is not as active as she would like, but White has more problems with the mobility of several pieces.} 30. Re1 Nf4 {And black finds a winning continutation.} 31. Nb1 Ne2+ {And misses his best move Qc2# when he played d3 to pin the knight!} 32. Rxe2 dxe2 {White resigns.  It probably seems to him that black is purposefully playing the weaker moves to illustrate the point that white is dead to rights, but once the idea of Ne2+ hit black, he seemed to have forgotten Qc2# twice.  Black is too busy looking at 33...Rf1+ 34.Be1 Rxe1+ 35.Kd2 Qd1+ 36.Ke3 e1=Q#}
