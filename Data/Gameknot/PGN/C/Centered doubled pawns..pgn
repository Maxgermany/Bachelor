1. d4 g6 2. Bf4 Bg7 3. Nf3 b6 4. c3 {Bad. The idea is to support d4 and play for the control of the white diagonal, but e4 should be done now, then supported.  True is that that leads to a very well-known game. } Bb7 5. Nbd2 Nf6 {Yep, now e4 is impossible. Too bad.  } 6. Nc4 {This way, I look for a reason for c3. :-)))} d5 7. Nce5 {...as predicted, after d5, this is a solid spot for the knitgt. Here, black sholud have played Nh5, and I have to go something like Qd2 and discourage f6. } Nbd7 8. e3 O-O 9. Bb5 {Assuminig I can hold on Nh5, I make my outcome this way. } Nxe5 {More or less forced. I have 3 ways to retake it... } 10. Nxe5 {My knight there. I like it :-)} a6 {The normal procedure leads me to bite granite... I can take advantage from this and control Nh5.} 11. Be2 Ne4 {As scary as it seems, this move rarely is a threat in this scheme. } 12. f3 Bxe5 {You NEVER must unblock a self-blocked fianchetto, but this time, I have compensation.} 13. dxe5 Nc5 {Ok, he gets there. I didn't want to exchange my beloved dsb for a knight with no future.} 14. Qd4 {Here, I blundered. I simply didn't consider the next black's move.} Ne6 {So my bishop is lost, and the center control, too. I plan to castle, sadly, kinside now. } 15. Qd2 {Where else? a4? d1? d3?} c5 {Black grabs this important advance. I have to be very careful after the positional blunder. } 16. Bh6 {...but my bishop is saved! And he will do great, there!} Re8 17. O-O-O {What the hell! Let's see who's first! :-)} d4 18. Qc2 {Tricky... did you expect it? :-) Any pawn's exchange would have been at my disadvantage. } Qd7 {? He can take the queen away from the column, since if I exchange pawns, I get the center, but also Rc8, followed by b5, and I lose a piece at least.} 19. e4 {I am self-blocking my own queen's action, but I'll take care of this later. But my two centered doubled pawns are a barrier for black's action. Without f8 (because of the bishop), black cannot go f5 - this is the point! And the nasty knight has almost no game, there, but to block my bishop's useless retirement (g5, f4) and self block black's pieces!} Bc6 {A crucial loss of tempo. Ba4 can be a threat in the sense that it helps his pawns approach my king, but just that: Ba4, b3, Bb6, c4! and black has to lose tempos in order to rebuild his attack (Bc6, and it's my turn to attack: f4, etc.)} 20. f4 {at once, based on the previous comment. } Ra7 {This move can be intended for attack or defence. Both are too far for this to be useful. Again, better for black is removing the queen from the d column, and try to attack as quicly as possible. } 21. f5 {Alea jacta est. } Nc7 {? Another piece off king's side. Better was Nf8. } 22. Bg4 {I'm not so sure, but it just looked magnificent. :-) Black cannot play b3 now. He can break in, but he lost valuable tempos without an attack plan. The old lesson: attacks has to be as quick and mortal as possible, It is very rare for an "under 2000" to be able to judge when he can "slowly prepare" the attack... without becoming a victim of an attack himself. So, don't wait. } e6 {I confess I was tempted to go f6, and then manage to take the queen to g7#. But, being realistic, it just takes too much time!! } 23. fxg6 fxg6 {I think it is the bad choice, but true is that both are wekeners.} 24. h4 {My turn to be unsure of priorities: take the queen into the attack, or this pawn?} Qf7 {Ugly move, desperate. It only helps me. } 25. Rdf1 Qe7 26. h5 {Or Rf6. } g5 27. Rf6 {Now, even better!} Qd7 28. Qf2 {Bxg5 is fine, but this is "quicker and stronger" :-)} Raa8 {Sad necessity. } 29. Rf1 {More of the same!} Qe7 {Ah... but then now I still have...} 30. Bxg5 {What a white pieces' storm...} Qg7 31. Qf4 h6 32. Bxh6 Qh7 33. Rg6+ Kh8 34. Qf6+ Qg7 35. Qxg7# {}
