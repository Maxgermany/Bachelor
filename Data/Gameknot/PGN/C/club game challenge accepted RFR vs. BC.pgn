[Opening "Dutch defence, Blackburne variation (A81)"]

1. d4 f5 {redfoxrising: We are seeking club input (discussion) of potential moves.   So it is now my turn in this unrated game, I will take my time to move to allow for club discussion.   I'll add in some candidate moves, We are not concerned about open discussion and there is no need to make this a club consultation match with white and black teams. Please feel free to openly discuss potential moves for both white played by redfoxrising and brigadecommander who is playing black. 2.Bg5 is my attacking plan since her King is exposed! My battery is at 4% so I am going to shut down for now look forward to all suggestions!  nambam: if i was playing white I would play2.Bf4 developing the DSB,them open up the other bishop with 3.e3  archduke_piccolo: My favourite is the standard... 2.g3.   But I have no objection to 2.Bg5, 2.Bf4, 2.c4 or 2.Nf3.  If we want to go down the wild and woolly 2.e4 (Staunton gambit) track, I don't mind. redfoxrising: I also like the 2.g3 move and the reason is to open up the lsb and gain control of the long diagonal.  jkarp: my vote is also 2.g3 for the reason that ION mentioned. For me, though, what I particularly enjoy is the fact that we're fianchettoing.     } 2. g3 {brigadecommander: I agree The 2.g3 variation is very strong for White..It is more of a positional move then an aggressive move. I play it as white against all 1.d4 openings.I will respond latter tonight.It is 7;40 AM here right now. } Nf6 {redfoxrising: Expected this move anyone feel free for suggestions comments  archduke_piccolo: Popular... ... and good, here, is 3.Bg2.   Having played the g-pawn forward to accommodate the bishop, we might as well play it now, and keep our options open in respect of the knights. We establish an immediate presence on the central light squares, which might be worth something if we later place a knight on c3 or a queen on b3.   There is an alternative that might be worth looking at, and I wouldn't say 'no' to: 3.Nh3. I've not played it before; it is a bit unusual, but develops a knight whilst at the same time keeping the light long diagonal uninterrupted. Against that, though, is that as we would be likely to play Bg2 the move following, and there seems to be nothing against following with 4.Nh3 if we chose, there seems to be no compelling reason to move the knight just yet.   Also playable are 3.Nf3 - straightforward development - and 3.Bg5. Also possible is 3.c4. That move I have played (by transposition) against strong opposition, for a draw.  brigadecommander: I am relieved that  you guys are not playing the Staunton Gambit!! as hinted at by the arch duke. } 3. Bg2 {redfoxrising: I also see no reason not to play 3. Bg2 as that was the plan, and then we can start more development of our minor pieces. The Staunton Gambit is something that I want to play someday.  Black to move..  the-sigularity:3.e6 opens diagonal for dsb and good for early castle    } e6 {brigadecommander: Depending on Whites plan,i intend a Dutch stonewall.  archduke_piccolo:  I knew it! Black intends a Stonewall. I seem to recall that it is a bit of a favourite with Janet, and I quite like that defence myself. I near as a toucher mentioned the possibility in an earlier posting, but figured that might not so smart a thing to do. The Stonewall is named for the strong Maginot line of pawns across the central 4 files. But it masks an aggressive intent - more reminiscent of the sobriquet of a certain Confederate general officer...   Three options suggest themselves, here: 4.c4, 4.Nf3, 4.Nh3  I'd probably go for the first of these, staking out a share of the centre, but Nf3 does immediately poke at the major weakness in Black's planned opening: e5.   Developing the knight at h3 is a far-seeing move, one of whose motivations is to manouevre via f4 to c3, aiming for e5. The other knight would be developed via d2 to f3. The other motivation is an eventual f-pawn advance to f4, to establish a firm control of e5.   Having said that, the move can wait a move or two (but of course, if Nf3, is no longer an option). refoxrising: On my phone archduke Thanks for the in-depth analysis. 4 c4 will be my move I will wait and see her move I think she develop her B  In any case I plan Nf3 as suggested } 4. c4 d5 {redfoxrising: I'm considering 5.Qb3 to protect a B check! I encourage anyone to suggest another move but for now I will wait for some input of the other moves you think are better! Even BC might add a comment you never know  Just a reminder this is a unrated game and its getting interesting nambam:I would still play Bg5.better late than never,and follow with Nb3. it is imperative against this line to get both bishops into the contest as early as possible and to exert pressure on e5 archduke_piccolo:  White's 5th move... Plenty of choice here.   One might try 5.Qb3, to steer the game into uncharted territory, but I think there are better options. I would not worry overmuch about ...Bb4ch, as we can always interpose a bishop and 'ask' (as it were) Black if she really wants to part with her 'good' bishop.   If we want to move our queen, then what about 5.Qc2, instead? The move covers c4 against capture (unlikely, but possible), but also establishes a presence on the c-file should we decide at some point to take on d5.   Alternatively, we can develop one of the knights. My preference is to finish developing on the K-side - so 5.Nf3 and 5.Nh3.   5,Nf3 looks 'natural', aiming immediately at the 'hole' on e5. We can then castle, and set about mobilising the other wing. The drawback to this is difficulty in bringing the other knight into effective action. That we would have to think about. Having said that, the move is quite sound and solid.   5.Nh3, on the other hand, looks artificial, in complete defiance of the usual guidelines in respect of the centre. But the intent is to bring this knight fairly shortly via f4 to d3; and the Queen's knight develops via d2 to f3. Both would then be focusing upon the e5-square. Quite in keeping with the centralising principle. I like this idea, and it is unclear - given that it involves four further knight moves - whether Black has the means to prevent it.   As it happens, in the sequence of knight manouevres, it is likely we would want to play Qc2 anyway. If I were voting I would probably opt for one of these two moves: 5.Qc2 or 5.Nh3. For mine, a 50-50 call. } 5. Nh3 {redfoxrising: It was either this move 5. Nh3or Qc2  I chose this for development reafons, but also believe Qc2  Also we can castle or play other developing moves.  We are working hard against the Stonewall and I feel we can play  Our game with each move to penetrate the Generals wall  Defence.  } Be7 {redfoxrising:Move 6 suggestions 6.Qc2 was on the discussion so that is the question? Are we ready for this Q move or do we have some other suggestions? Off to work I'll check back in later  } 6. O-O {redfoxrising: move 6 0-0 decided to move 6. 0-0 Had thought it over today and feel it is better than Qc2 Black to move archduke_piccolo: Sorry... ... didn't get back to this in time. Quite happy with 6.0-0, but would also have been OK with 6.Qc2, or 6.Nd2. All are thematic.     } O-O {brigadecommander: White has a workable advantage.I knew that going into this variation. Black pins her hopes on the Middle-game. And on building 'Interior lines of comunications'.  archduke_piccolo: Whoa... I was about to suggest 7.Nd2 or 7.Qc2, but suddenly they don't look so attractive. Why? My concern is with the possible reply 7...Ne4, after which our plan of establishing our own knights on f3 and d3 don't look so realisable. E.g. 7.Nd2 Ne4 8.Nf3? g5 ... and we are in 'Uh, oh' country. We could delay the knight moves by 8.Qc2, but I think we might fetch up looking for another plan.   The alternative plan might involve f2-f4 and/or b2-b3, to bring our light-square bishop to a more useful diagonal.   The moves Nd2 or Qc2 won't hurt us, exactly, but it might be worthwhile looking around for alternatives, or else a plan that will 'go' with these moves. For instance, we might play 7.Qc2 Ne4 8.f3 driving back the knight. The drawback is that f3 would no longer be available to the c2-knight.   Big Think time methinks...  jkarp: What about something like 7.Bg5 In a position like this, where Janet's Nf6, Be7, and Q on the same diagonal, I'd be tempted to try and put pressure on her. Question is how effective is this given her strength? Against your average player, so in 1 or 2 OTB Tournament Games, it was quite effective. And, that was, before I started notating them. nambam: I think our lsb is misplaced personally, should be on e2 in my opinion. it is a bit late now to further develop the dsb. i would now go ahead with Nd2 or perhaps pxp first. we are playing janet's game at the moment archduke_piccolo: Bg2. I'm not at all fazed by the location of our DSB. It's fine where it is.   My thoughts are now on Qc2, Nd2 or b3. At the moment I think I would go with any of these three. Of the last of these my one caveat is: what does it do for us? Relocate the bishop to a better diagonal, or is it simply a better guard over c4 (which, after all, isn't guarded at all right now)? Maybe both?   Note that, after 7.Nd2 Ne4 we really don't want to exchange knights on e4. Further, we will probably want to play 8.Qc2, to ensure c4 is adequately protected. As it turns out, after 7.Qc2 Ne4, we'd likely want to play 8.Nd2. So, in effect, the first two moves of the trio amount pretty much to the same thing. Nor do they rule out b2-b3 shortly thereafter.   So I reckon I'll be happy enough with Nd2 or Qc2. I won't be hugely sorry, though, if the preference fell on b3.  redfoxrising: still time left to decide I think the best moves are Nd2,Qc2, and b3  so my decision is to choose 1 of the 3 and and the move order is pretty much interchangeable   I'm going to keep on thinking a little bit in case someone else wishes to add to the discussion.   } 7. b3 c6 {brigadecommander: The Frontier fortifications are Complete. Depending on what White does, Black now has the task of organizing her Interior Lines behind her Central Bulwark. redfoxrising: some moves we have discussed including 8. Nd2,Qc2 of those I favor Nd2   For new moves in no particular order 8.e3, Nc3 of these I favor Nc3  A new move fianchetto 8.Bb2   So to narrow down 8. Bb2 or Nd2 I'm leaning towards 8. Bb2 as the best of these moves.    Nd2,Bb2,Nc3,e3;Qc2 are the choices please make your selection for move 8. from these or possibly a better suggested move. archduke_piccolo: Now that we have advanced the b-pawn, we might as well fianchetto the bishop. But here's a thing: how about inviting Black to exchange off her dark-square bishop by playing 8.Ba3? That will leave Black's centre a trifle weak on the dark squares. It won't be easy to exploit, of course, without our own DSB, but sure bears thinking about.   Alternatives seem to be 8.Bb2 and 8.Nd2. On the whole I prefer the bishop face-off: 8.Ba3. } 8. Ba3 Bxa3 {nambam: Obviously NXB} 9. Nxa3 Qe7 {redfoxrising: Discussion of our move 10. N on a3 is now attacked. Nc2 or Nb1. Qc1 protects the N.   Any suggestions? } 10. Nc2 Nbd7 {brigadecommander: White has some advantage.  redfoxrising: Looking at 11.Rc1 ?not sure what she may play here  12.cxd5 cxd5 13.Qd2  But my plan is to get Rook to the center on the c-file and get Q moved up to connect our Rooks  Any suggestions? } 11. Rc1 b6 {redfoxrising: 12. cxdx 12.Ne3 12.Nf4 12.Qd2 or another suggested move?   Those are my suggestions thus far, I have some other active games then I will come back to this game as it has the most time. Of the 4 moves I seem to now like 12. Nf4 but am open to suggestions as at one time I thought I ranked them in my preference of move order, just goes to show you need to look for your best move. We have time, but I tend to want to move too fast, enjoy the long days of summer but please do consider making your choices known as I would hate to make my next moves with out your participation.  12.Nf4 Bb7 13.cxd5 cxd5  Move order could be … As Nf4 is a better square for our N getting it off the rim and Bb7 gets her B activated. Then taking cxd5 or be taken by her sooner dxc7.  We also need to look at her last move of b6 it is a development move that allows her DSB to get in the game.  This is a very challenging game playing her with such a higher rating. But being a unrated game does allow us to play her with potentially Club members Times X : against just her! So lets keep our advantages as just 1 wrong move we can easily lose it, I'd much more want to keep our slight advantage over her while we can.   brigadecommander: a unrated game allows me the Luxury of experimenting with certain Openings. Taking more risks etc. The Dutch Defense has long interested me. I believe it has great potential for improvement. So i learn also from these games. So far you guys have played an excellent game.... archduke_piccolo: Sorry - - This fell off the radar for a while. This won't be the last time that happens.   I'm good with 12.Nf4 , the likely continuation being 12...g5 13.Nd3 Bb7, at which point we can decide between 14.Ne3, 14.Ne1 or some other option.   A reasonable alternative to Nf4 might be 12.Ne3, but I'm not really sure where that might lead us. } 12. Nf4 g5 13. Nd3 Bb7 {brigadecommander: arch duke, i am officially calling my position 'Helms Deep'  jkarp: I'm thinking now of something like 14.Qd2 to connect the R's, but also there's tension, even when Janet protects g5. redfoxrising: thanks Joe 14. Qd2 has been a suggested move by Jkarp  anyone else have a suggestion? how about 14. Ne3 She might play Ne4? or Rac8 then we can play 15. Qc2...Ne4? move order not sure of?  archduke_piccolo:I'm going to suggest... 14.Ne1.  Whether it is any better than Ne3, or even as good, I don't know, but it seems to me a 'natural' sort of move, with 15.Nf3 in mind.  redfoxrising: both N's can be moved to e1 Ion I'm thinking Nce1 is best is this the N you suggested?  What do you think Joe? Ion posted Ne1 and you tend to be interested in his suggestions. If you read this first please let us know which N move and why. I did bot choose Nd because it is more centrally located and thus I believe in a better position. I did make the suggestion prior for Ne3 which may not be better than Ne1   Anyone else care to participate in this discussion? jkarp: I agree with you Ron and think that 14.Nce1 is better then 14.Nde1 for the reason that you mentioned. So, 14.Nce1 is my vote. In addition, we can move it to a better spot, whereas, our Nd3 is better placed.  } 14. Nce1 {archduke_piccolo: You are right... ... I meant 14.Nce1. I was so fixated on the 'either/or' that I didn't notice the other knight could so move. Mind you, I wasn't really expecting much agreement, neither! The idea is Nf3 then (maybe) Nfe5. It is possible Black might cut across this by 14...g4, against which I would consider 15.f4. } h6 {brigadecommander: White has the Advantage.} 15. Nf3 {archduke_piccolo: ok... I thought I had endorsed 15.Nef3. Maybe (as I often do) forgot to 'Post Now'.  redfoxrising: ok thought so too! Thanks archduke!   Here comes the fighting Uruk-hai! } Rac8 {brigadecommander: Better ask Saruman to conjure up some explosives if you want to breech my Walls!!.   ''"Look to my coming, at first light, on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East." G  redfoxrising:Thinking 16. Ne5 but which N? any suggestion? expect NxN then retake NxN. So does it matter? I'm asking this for participation reasons as I do appreciate input in this game.   Is there a better move? Another plan? I'm sure there is and I have been looking at many moves since she moved..   We have time, time is running out, anyone care to make a suggestion? If not. I'll be moving soon. Get your suggestions in   } 16. Nfe5 {brigadecommander: Red that's the best move you had.White still has advantage. } Nxe5 17. Nxe5 {archduke_piccolo: I keep missing these... ... having all sorts of other places to visit...   I would have chosen the f-Knight to go to e5, sure.  redfoxrising: thanks archduke Games still active I'm thinking I need to get the Queen in the game   Anyone else care to express a comment? } Nd7 {brigadecommander: oops made a bad error.  archduke_piccolo: The obvious move... ... seems to be the best way to exploit Janet's wee slip: 18.Ng6. redfoxrising: yes indeed, Anyone else ?? I would play this in hopes of the fork, against lower rated players.  I could not spell out this here in our discussion, would of done by PM, but I never expected her slip. I looked at other moves that would of stopped the fork plan from happening. I know jkarp is behind what ever you suggest... Haven't heard any others comments in this team game from anyone else.  Thanks for your suggestion Ion it does seem to be the best suggested move. } 18. Ng6 {brigadecommander: I make mistakes like every one else. I planned 17...Rd8 followed by Nd7. I inverted the order.If you guys pool your resources you have a won game.But i will still fight on. } Qd6 {redfoxrising: Nxf8 complete the attack after the fork too bad it wasn't a check fork, I thought it was then just realized it wasn't } 19. Nxf8 Rxf8 {redfoxrising: things went fast It's our turn now! So time to discuss move 20. Many moves to choose from...   pawn moves like e3 are compound move as it opens the white diagonal for the Q   Qc2 or Qd3 does 2 things develops a major piece and connects the Rooks   there are other move considerations, please let us know what you want to suggest.   I make a move soon or could allow some others to get online and give us a suggestion.  archduke_piccolo: I must admit... ... I'm tempted by 20.c5, here. The main line seems to run   20.c5 bxc5  21.dxc5 Nxc5  22.Qd4 Ne4  23.Bxe4!? fxe4  24.Qxa7 ...  I have to admit I would be somewhat concerned about that central Black pawn phalanx, and the weaked light squares on the K-side, but against that, Black is left with a 'bad' bishop, and White still has the exchange and a remote passer on the Q-side.   Whether this is any good, or White has anything better, have yet to be determined. redfoxrising: I like c5 and I will play c5 I plan to follow what Ion has predicted  } 20. c5 {archduke_piccolo: Uh... I would have gone along with 20...Qd2...     But I still think 20.c5 is OK. } bxc5 {archduke_piccolo:Next move is a gimme... No alternative but 21.dxc5, and after 21...Nxc5, 22.Qd4.   } 21. dxc5 Qc7 {redfoxrising: If looking to connect our Rooks Qd2 or Qc2 . Other moves to consider are f4 and Re1.  I'm looking for discussion. Hope everyone had a good week-end!  We have a nice advantage here in this game and now need to double-check our moves and be sure to find the best possible moves. archduke_piccolo: Once again... Probably just as well. I was thinking of 22.b4, but maybe 22.Qd2 is a better option. } 22. b4 {redfoxrising: I was thinking... I looked at almost every possible move and b4 has my approval and I'm sure jkarp would like it also. That's my move 22. b4 protecting our passed pawn} a5 {Drat... ... I came here with another idea: 22.f4. Never mind.   I did consider 23.b5 in response to Black's Move 22, but have decided the combination that follows is a losing proposition. Instead, I'll go for the 'natural' 23.a3. } 23. a3 Ba6 {jkarp: This is really, as GM Susan Polgar puts it on, "What does my opponent want?" Well, in this case, Janet wants us to move our Q in a place where it doesn't protect e2 so that she can get a pawn. As such, I think that 24.Bf3 is our best move and gets my vote to give it extra protection, as that will enable us to move our Q on the next move. My real goal, in this position, would be to attack a5 which just isn't possible, yet.  redfoxrising: good observation jkarp I was looking at f4 I do however like your suggestion of 24.Bf3  I hope Ion can give us his suggestions...  I lost my previous notes that I thought I post just prior to your suggestion.  Q development was some of my ideas  posting know from my cell phone for now!  archduke_piccolo: If ... 24.Bf3, I'd be concerned about 24...g5, which would force the bishop back to g2. It will probably be best to leave our bishop where it is.   My list of candidate moves here would be.   24.Qd2  24.f4  24.Re1  24.Qa4  The last of these is a bit of an outlier, but it does not look as though the enemy bishop can't take ...Bxe2, on account of 25.Re1 Bc4 26.Rxe6. On the other hand 24...Bb5 looks an effective reply.   Probably I would choose between Qd2 and f4. Haven't yet made up my mind.  nambam: i lost track a bit because of hospital visit, bur am o.k. now. i think queen move is the go,as along with joe i want to keep an eye on e2 . i think think Qd2 will be best,and see what eventuates. so.22 Qd2 is my vote  redfoxrising:  I also think 24.Qd2 is a good move  Anyone else? We still have time } 24. Qd2 a4 {brigadecommander: ArchD; i think you had better ask Saruman for some explosives!!  redfoxrising: 25. Re1 or f4 or f3  some possible moves 25. Re1 or f4 or f3  any others?  archduke_piccolo: Any of those moves ... ... seems reasonable.   I quite like 25.f4.   I did consider 25.h4, as well, which leads to fun and games after 25...f4. But on the whole I don't think we get enough. Janet has hinted that she has compensation for the material deficit. I think she's probably at least partly right. } 25. f4 g4 {redfoxrising: Our turn to move how about 26. Rf2 or Qe3  or:  26.h4 e.p. pxh3 27. Bxh4   26. h3 h5   then 27. h4   Here wall does need something to get thru it!   Any Suggestions?  archduke_piccolo: Janet... Is playing for the draw, and hopes to place a bind right across the board. I admit that I didn't expect ...g4, on the grounds that it does offer us a lever to open the h-file on that flank. What I'm thinking now is to keep that lever in mind but for now, see what the prospects are for breaking open the centre.   Were we to play 26.h3 h5 then I suggest 27.hxg4. I would not play 26.h4, as that would lock up the K-side. She wouldn't even bother playing ...h5-h4, preferring to keep that move in hand for a 'waiting' move (or, as I call it, a 'lever').   26.Rf2 has its points, as does 26.Kf2. But maybe would could look at Rfe1 or Rfd1, freeing the e-pawn. We should also be on the lookout for chances favourably to offer the exchange back.   Not an easy position to play, this. } 26. Rfe1 {redfoxrising: avoiding a draw 26. Rfe1 Loading our torpedo!!! avoiding a draw!!! } Nf6 {brigadecommander: The Wall is getting stronger.Torpedoes will not avail you now. You can still prevail but, You need an Armored Division at the least. BC  nambam: this wall is going to take some breaking down alright. i think we could continue to probe for now. either Rb1 or perhaps Qd4 and give janet a chance to provide a chink? 27.Rb1 is my vote  redfoxrising: Move 27  Rb1. Qd4 any other suggestions?  both move are good how ever I do like Qd4 and 2nd is Rb1   anyone else wish to contribute?  archduke_piccolo:Let's try... 27.Qb2, getting the Q onto the long diagonal, and eyeing the b-file for the time being. I think the Qb2 positioning is a bit more flexible than the Qd4.   I admit to being very tempted by 27.e4, but it seems to be good only for a draw, if that. I'd also like to try the h3 break some time, but that should wait until the moment is the most propitious.   Meanwhile, I think Janet's appraisal is about right: if White is to win this, it will take patience and alertness, and is likely to require a sacrificial attack to bust through that line of pawns. I thought of exchanging bishops (e3, followed by Bf1) but in the resulting position, the knight is as good as a rook. So I'd probably prefer to give up the bishop for the knight.  } 27. Qb2 Kf7 {nambam: I would continue to probe 28. Qd4. redfoxrising: move 28 any more suggestions  Qd2 is on the long diagonal from move 27. Qb2 nambam suggested Qd4 again for 28  I think a pawn move or a rook move is better or B back to our base line.    trying to break the wall, need some more suggestions move 28. not easy to choose h3,e3, Bf1,Kf2,Red1,Rcd1. Qd4 nambam  archduke_piccolo: Difficult... I played through a conjectural line beginning Qe5 that went down to a rook and 5 vs bishop and 6. The ending position left nowhere where the the White king could invade or break through. I'm beginning to suspect a win is now unlikely. I'm tempted to play h3, but I don't think that leads anywhere unless we can get leverage elsewhere. That 'elsewhere has to be the centre, and we don't have anything there at the moment.   I think I'd try Rcd1, but I'm not optimistic. nambam: Rcd1 is one of my suggested waiting moves,so i vote Rcd1 } 28. Rcd1 Rg8 {archduke_piccolo: I'm looking... ... at 29.Qe5, here. Looking at the possibility a move or so back, it didn't look so attractive, but with both rooks on the centre files, it doesn't look so bad at all.   Further investigation needed, of course - let's not be too hasty. Other ideas are:   29.Qd4  29.h3  29.h4 (= in my view)  29.e4 another move I've been eyeing for a while, but not clear that it gives us anything.  29.e3 possibly with the view to exchanging off bishops - can't say this floats my boat, neither. The relevance to our position... ... appears to be the potential breaks at b5 and h3. Black has a potential break at b4. By sacrificing a knight there, she might create a passed pawn.   She might also have in mind the kind of switching attention from wing to wing, though in the problem, that is forced upon White, whose path to the ideal squares is a long and narrow one.   What I have been looking at are potential breaks for White in the centre, focusing on what e2-e4 might achieve. in the circumstances, that doesn't look easy to arrange, given Black's coverage of that square. And that is why Qe5 has drawn my attention over the last couple of moves or so. At first it looked unpromising, but I'm coming round to thinking that maybe that is where our best chance lies.   So, my vote is for 29.Qe5.   But I'm not going to complain if the vote comes down to a different choice, and am willing to be persuaded that a better option exists. nambam: after playing through what i think are all possible moves to break the deadlock, i conclude that i agree with the duke in that our best chance lies with 29. Qe5. it then depends on whether janet wants to swap queens or not. i have played out both scenarios to some lengths,and believe that both give us chances,but will wait to see which way the cat jumps before going into more detail. } 29. Qe5 {redfoxrising: thanks duke and morgan I also have been looking at this same move...   } Qxe5 {brigadecommander: I think i would have played e3 as white. The Only plausible breakthrough point was b5. Exchanging Bishops would have facilitated that. IMHO However some interesting,Combinative, and aggressive lines of attack, are now open to White.

Nd7 I'm considering 31. e4 fxe4 Now the wall will fall! archduke_piccolo: I looked at the bishop exchange... ... It was kinda obvious, but it seemed to me would not have got us anywhere. Sure, we had the twin 'breaks' at b5 and h3 (as I mentioned earlier), but they would have been easily contained, in my view. So, having examined the e3, Be1, exchange bishops sequence, I was inclined to discard it. Perhaps I ought to have mentioned it.   Having said that, that was merely my opinion. If, having discussed the matter, the others taken the opposing view, I would have gone along with it. After all, it could scarcely have lost us the game.   As it happens, I am pleased Janet accepted the exchange of Queens. I was more than half expecting her to decline. The reasons will emerge, I think, over the next few moves.   At this point, I quite like 31.e4, as redfox recommends.  nambam: i agree. i am somewhat surprised janet exchanged. now that she has i think e4 is the obvious move.  brigadecommander: I anticipate and welcome e4. I took it into my calculations when you played 29.e5. I would advise you look deeper. I go on record as saying 29.e3 was the way to a win.  redfoxrising: I still believe we will get our win in time One of us will post the current board and then we will start looking for our next move... } 31. e4 {redfoxrising: 31. e4 played noted by Janet e3 would win.  seems only fair to play e4 thus it was played. } fxe4 {redfoxrising: It's our turn now any suggestions ??? White to discuss our next move...  archduke_piccolo: Yes. I have a suggestion. How about having a good hard look at   32.Rxe4.  The idea is 32...dxe4 33.Rxd7ch Ke8 34.Rd6.   } 32. Rxe4 {redfoxrising: I have looked at this same thing 32.Rxe4 and see what she does... That's the best  } Rg5 {redfoxrising: Our turn to move 33. Choices I see in no particular order for 33.  the plan duke & I thought would happen was not what I set for conditional moves...   Bf1, h3, h4, Rf4+ are my first thoughts for move 33. I even have a couple more, but believe one of these is best,    please post your suggestions.. brigadecommander: WAR I had no intention of opening up the center.My left flank is now open but...In tactical military terms i will 'refuse my flank'. The Duke will know what i mean. I hate War. But this is Chess.And Military Tactics work. Here is a example of 'refusing ones flank' nambam: 33. Bf1 is the best try i think, but i am not too confident. i dont think H3 will work and anything else is irrelevant or could lose redfoxrising: thanks nambam Morgan has suggested Bf1 it's still early and we have to here from duke or jk or anyone else who might want to get involved. If Bf1 is played what might be her reaction?   Rd2 was a move I left out with intention of getting to Rf2+   Bf1 first ,She's not opening the center and taking our R on e4 but if we play Bf1 it would be hanging ? so move order seems something we need to discuss    So now that I look at this closer maybe Rd2 might be our best move. What do you think?    I'm not making our next move that until I get confirmation from more than one adviser. jkarp: I also want ION's opinion, and I gather that he likes war. Of course, I don't compare chess to war as others do. Instead, I compare it to yoga, so keeping the breathes involved compared with our R being attacked, I'd try to settle it with 33.Rf1, and after black gets out, I'd go ahead with 34.Rf4 as my idea would be to simply double up on one file and try to create problems for black. In an easier position, but still complicated, I excercised the same idea when under pressure. And, I was able to win, fairly quick by doubling up like that. archduke_piccolo: I've looked at... ...  33.Rf4ch and  33.Bf1.  They pretty much transpose into the same thing:   33.Rf4ch Ke7  34.Bf1 Bxf1  35.Rxf1 Nxe5  36.Kg2 ...  with the idea 37.h3.   33.Bf1 Bxf1ch  34.Rf1ch Ke7  35.Rf4 ... etc.   To be honest, I don't think any other move comes into consideration, here.  } 33.

Last I looked was back at my lasy posting here. I think I would have played Kg2 ahead of h3, but I don't think it makes much difference, as h3 was the plan anyhow. redfoxrising: duke I made the moves following what you posted...  33.Rf4ch Ke7  34.Bf1 Bxf1  35.Rxf1 Nxe5  36.Kg2 ...  with the idea 37.h3.

She has more pawns than us and her other minor pieces are her R and B, Thinking she may go for our pawn on a3, We don't need to take with our R after 38.Rh4 Nc4 39.Rf1f3 to protect pa3   There is Joe and Ion who may see something so I will leave this open for further suggestions.  } 38.

[A] 40.Rb1  [B] 40.b5   It is my belief that we are looking at a draw, here. We just can't quite make our aggressive posture a really threatening one. Meanwhile, Black had strategic threats of her own. I'd probably go for option [B] as it does open a certain tactical possibility that could end the game with a flourish. redfoxrising: how about Rh1?  looked at both and Rh1 nambam: i agree with the archduke in that I think a draw will result if we do not make an aggressive move/ the way we have played. i believe we needed ro force an exchange of one of our rooks for the enemy nite to break open the centre to get behind the enemy lines with the other rook, and advancee our own freed centre , but the best chance of a win the way se played the opening Ithink is go with Rhi, see what Janet replies then, if possible follow with b5. highly risky, but why not a dukelly flourish? archduke_piccolo: @nambam... Yes, good. Let's add 40.Rh1 to our range of options. I still prefer 40.b5, but there's very little in it and prepared to go along with another option. nambam: the only reason i prefer the Rook first is it gives janet one more chance to make a slight error.   } 40.

Ra1 d3 {jkarp: It looks like we're in a lot of trouble. So, I'd be trying to figure out what to do with how dangerous Janet's passed pawn is. In this position, I would answer by attacking the N with 50.Rc8 and after the N retreats, then I'd play 51.Ra2 to stop the passed pawn from advancing any further. brigadecommander: you are not in a lot of trouble.With careful play it is a draw.  archduke_piccolo:  I reckon... ... we can hold. We might even have a slight edge.   I suggest just keep pushing our passer:   50.a6 d2  51.Rd8 ...   ANALYSIS of 51.a7:  At this point we probably could play 51.a7 instead, but then we would probably have to fight for the draw: 51.a7 Ra5! 52.Rxa5 d1=Q At this point Black is threatening checkmate by 53...Ne3ch 54.Kh2 Ng4ch 55.Kg2 Qe2ch etc. 53.Rf8 stops the mate by covering f2, but Black at keeps alive an attack with the same kind of sequence. However, after 53.Rg8, Ne3ch 54.Kh2 Ng4ch?? 55.Rxg4 ... White wins. Nor will Black play 53...Na5 as 54.a8=Q preserves for White some winning chances. So...   53...Nb6  54.a8=Q Nxa8  55.Rgxa8 ...  Should give us a tenable end game. As a matter of interest, if we were to trade off one of our rooks for Black's two pawns, and bring our remaining rook to f2, assuming the BK stays where it is, we should have a 'book' draw.  8  In the diagrammed position, even though White is in check, after Kg1 the game is drawn. White's set-up is called a 'fortress' and Black hasn't the resources to break it down, provided White is careful.   So 51.a7 would be playable. 51...Ne3ch  52.Kh3 Rd5  53.Rxd5 Nxd5 (not 53...exd5?? and White wins after 54.a7.)  54.a7 Nc7 or Nb6  At this point I think I would aim directly for the draw:   55.g4 hxg4  56.Kxg4 Ke3  57.Rd1 ...  No pussyfooting around!   57...Ke2  58.Ra1 ... (Actually, 58.Rxd2ch will do: Black can't stop the WK reaching e5)  58... d1=Qch  59.Rxd1 Kxd1  60.Kf4 ...  61.Ke5 ...  62.a8=Q ...  63.Kxe6 ...  Dead game: insufficient material. nambam: i cannot make any sense ot of what is the real position. assumig it is whites move 50 i would play pa6. redfoxrising: We will play on starting pa6 and go for our draw as shown by Ion's analysis.  } 50. a6 {nambam: i think black will check with the nite,but i think a draw is inevitable } d2 51.

I should have lost.....I barely survived against a very strong white advantage. archduke_piccolo:  Not so sure ... ... about the 'very strong White advantage'. That knight quickly took up a position that made it the near-equal of a rook. after maybe two moves I was already figuring that the win, if possible, was no 'gimme'. I might have a bit of a look at it later on... archduke_piccolo: At this point... I recommend 59.Kf4. When material down in a dead drawn position, it is my custom to await my opponent's draw offer. redfoxrising: I accepted the draw from BC I would have taken the promoted Q with our R and then gone to the center with our K to nab her last pawn}
