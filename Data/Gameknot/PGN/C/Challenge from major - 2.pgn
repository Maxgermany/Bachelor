[Opening "Sicilian (B32), Flohr variation"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian defence.  Black creates an asymmetrical position in hopes of getting counterplay on the queenside.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 d6 {I think this is where we leave the book lines.  } 5. Be2 {Because of the trapped dark bishop, I start anticipating a transposition to the dragon formation.  I always look forward to playing against the dragon.} e5 6. Nf3 {Losing tempo by replacing my knight on the same square.  In other variations, Nb3 is common.  I don't know which is better.    I don't want to trade knights and give black a stronger center though.} f5 {Very aggresive, attempting to remove my center pawn and opening the f file for the rook.  It weakens the e8-h5 diagonal, but with my bishop and knight positioned as they are, I don't see a way to take advantage of it.} 7. Nc3 {I decide against exf5, since that would develop his bishop, further strengthening black's center.} Nf6 {Attacking my e pawn again.} 8. Bg5 {Pinning the knight to counter the attack on my e pawn.} Be7 {Breaking the pin, allowing black to castle.} 9. Qd3 {Defending the pawn.} O-O 10. O-O-O {Castling queenside since I plan on pawnstorming black's king.  Looking at Bxf6 Bxf6, Qxd5 winning a pawn and at the weak a2-g8 diagonal.} fxe4 11. Nxe4 Bf5 {Bunder, overlooking Nxf6  and hanging the bishop.} 12. Nxf6+ Bxf6 {12...Rxg6 is probably better, leading to something like 13. Qd2 Rf7 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Qxd6 Rd8 16. Qxe7 Rxd1  17. Rxd1 Rxe7, leaving black a pawn down and an isolated e pawn.} 13. Qxf5 Bxg5+ 14. Qxg5 Qxg5+ 15. Nxg5 Rxf2 16. Bc4+ Kf8 17. Rhf1 {Pinning the rook, preventing it from causing any further havok.} Rxf1 18. Rxf1+ Ke8 19. Nxh7 {I had originally planned on Rf7, trapping the king on the back rank, but couldn't find a good continuation.  I decided to take black's kingside pawns and start pushing mine.} Kd7 20. Rf7+ Ne7 21. Rxg7 Rh8 22. Bd5 b6 23. Nf6+ Kd8 24. h3 Nxd5 {Trading pieces in the endgame is better for the side with more/passed pawns.} 25. Nxd5 Rf8 26. b3 Rf1+ 27. Kb2 Rd1 28. c4 b5 {28...Rd2  29. Kb1 Rd1  30. Kc2} 29. a3 bxc4 30. bxc4 a5 31. h4 {Finally pushing my passed pawns, I should probably have started earlier.} e4 32. h5 Rh1 33. g4 Ke8 {I didn't fear black's passed e pawn, but this gave it to me for free.} 34. Re7+ Kd8 35. Rxe4 Rh2+ 36. Kb3 Rh3+ 37. Re3 {More than happy to trade rooks.} Rh4 38. Nf6 Kc7 39. g5 Rf4 {A final mistake, allowing me to fork the king and rook.  I almost passed this up to push the h pawn again, but decided I didn't want to deal with the eventual trade on h8.} 40. Nd5+ {1-0}
