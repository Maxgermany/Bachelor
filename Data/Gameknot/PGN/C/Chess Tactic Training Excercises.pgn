[Opening "Sicilian (B50)"]

1. e4 {He decides to play the King's Pawn Opening.  I understand because it is also my favorite opening.} c5 {The, "cornerstone" of the Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nf3 {! He decides to play the Open Sicilian.  I also understand his POV because I would do the same, if I were white.  According to Jack Stockel, this is the proper continuation, after your opponent opens with 1...c5.} d6 {This is the proper continuation of the Sicilian Defense.} 3. a3 {? This is a blunder.  According to Mr. Stockel, 3.d4 is the proper continuation of the Open Sicilian and the best response to 2...d6. } a6 {If he had played 3.d4, I would have responded with 3...cxd4.  In this position, however, I decided to advance my a6 pawn.  Sooner or later, I would have played this move.  According to Jack, you are supposed to play a6, when you open with the Sicilian.  That is because it prevents your opponent from playing Nb5 or Bc5.} 4. d4 {At this point, he decides to continue with the Open Sicilian.  This is not a bad move, but would have done this two moves earlier, if I were late.  However, it is not too late.} cxd4 {I decide to take his d4 pawn.  This is part of the Sicilian, as well.  If your opponent plays d4, it is best to respond with PxP.} 5. Qxd4 {? This is a mistake.  5.Nxd4 would have been his best move.  He brought his queen out too early, so he has violated General Opening Principles.  There are certain positions where it is ok to bring your queen out, in the beginning, but this is not one of them.  In this position, I will chase his queen with 5...Nc6.  } Nc6 6. Qd5 {Therefore, he is forced to retreat his queen, so he has just a lost a tempo.  At the same time, I will rechase his queen, while I develop another minor piece, with 6...Be6.  As a result, he will then be forced to move his queen away from danger, so it will cost him another move.    } Be6 7. Qd3 b5 {I originally thought he would try to win a free pawn, with 8.Qxa6, but I forgot that my a6 pawn is protected by my a8 rook.  However, this was not my best move because I wasted my time by trying to protect my a6 pawn.  On the other hand, it is not so bad, for I will eventually rechase the queen away.  I will explain this concept shortly.   } 8. Bf4 {He chose this candidate to develop his other piece, but it does not matter.  Once again, I will drive his queen away with 9...Bc4, so he will be forced to retreat it with 9.Qc3.  Therefore, he will loose another tempo.} Bc4 9. Qc3 Rc8 {? I do not know why I played this, but it is a blunder.  9...Bxf1 would have been my best move because it would have stopped him from castling.  In general, you do not want to automatically castle, but it is important to have that option, according to Natalia Pogonina.  If I had played, 9...Bxf1, castling would not be a choice.  } 10. Bxc4 {! He chose this candidate so that he could castle, and this a very good move.  In this position, I will recapture his LSB.  However, he will win a free pawn, after the exchange, when 10...bxc4 and 11.Qxc4 are played.  Therefore, I will be a point behind.} bxc4 11. Qxc4 Ne5 {!! I moved my knight to attack his queen, and this is my best move.  I refer to this as a Double Attack, and I got this term from my game against damaestro.  That is because id=damestro said that he mated me with a, "Mating Net".  The mating move involved a, "Double Check".  Therefore, this opponent cannot defend his queen with with 12.Nxf3, or I will respond with 12...Rxc4.  As a result, he will also loose his most powerful piece.} 12. Qb3 {Therefore, he is forced to retreat his queen, so he will lost another important move.  } Nxf3+ {? In the meantime, I decide to force a knight exchange by placing him in check.  However, this is a blunder because I am still behind, so it is not a good idea to exchange pieces. } 13. gxf3 {? This is a bigger mistake because he now has two weak f pawns.  I believe that two weak pawns will put him at a disadvantage, in this position.} Qa5+ {? This is another weak move.  I originally placed him in check because his king is now exposed.  Therefore, I thought that it would take away his opportunity to castle.  However, I forgot about too much his material.  In other words, I forgot that he could defend with his Queen, b1 knight, c2 pawn, or DSB.} 14. Nc3 {I am just lucky that he did not play 14.Bd2, or I would be forced to retreat my queen.  Therefore, I would loose a tempo.} Qh5 {I moved my queen so that I could win a free pawn, and I wanted to find an eventual mating pattern or win his h1 rook.  Note: I am trying to think way in advance.  That is because id=inadowman and Jack Stockel have told me that it is very important to think steps ahead, not just one or two steps.} 15. O-O-O {In this position, he had to castle Queen Side.  If he did not castle, I would have planned a Mating Sequence, starting with my queen and rook.  In addition, castling King Side, would not have been much better because I am attacking, from that direction.  However, I am still going to win a free pawn with 15...Qxf3.  Therefore, things will be even.  BTW, this is the danger of having a, "double pawn".  In other words, two weak pawns allows you to capture one of those free pawns, in most circumstances.  There are exceptions, but this is not one of them.} Qxf3 16. Nd5 {?? This is his loosing blunder.  Even though the game is not lost, this is the mistake that will eventually cost him the game.  16.Be3 would have been his best move as it would have kept his queen safe and protected his f2 pawn.  However, I will win his queen, and it will not be an, "even exchange".  This is where the chess tactic training exercises starts to play a role.  That will be explained shortly.  } Qxb3 {In this position, he cannot recapture my queen with 16...cxb2 because it would be an illegal move, due to my c8 pawn.} 17. Nc3 {?? Therefore, he decides to advance his knight so that he can win back the queen, but I am not about to let that happen.  That is because I will make 17...PxQ illegal.  As a result, I will sac my rook and win an extra piece with 17...Rxc3 18.bxc3, Qxc3.  Consequently, I will be 8 points ahead, after the exchange.  This is, btw, where I applied the biggest chess tactic training because this position is almost identical to one of the exercises.  } Rxc3 18. bxc3 Qxc3 19. Be3 {?? I do not know why he moved his DSB, but this is another mistake.  19.a4 would have been his best move, as it would have protected the pawn.  In this position, I will win that pawn by placing him in check, with 19...Qxa3+ } Qxa3+ 20. Kd2 {In this position, 20.Kb1 was his only other choice.} Nf6 {! I chose this candidate to win a free pawn.  However, it gets much better then that, and I will explain it shortly.} 21. Rda1 {?? He moved his rook to chase my queen away, and he thinks that he has succeeded in doing so.  However, he is wrong because I will win his e4 pawn by placing him in check, with 21.Nxe4+.  Therefore, I will be 9 points ahead, instead of 8.  In addition, 21.f3 is the only move that would have saved his pawn.     } Nxe4+ 22. Ke2 {22.Kd1, or 22.Ke1 were his only other choices.  However, 22.Ke1 is the only other move that would have protected his f2 pawn.} Qb2 {I also could have played 22.Nc3+, but it would be a nuisance check.  Therefore, I would waste my time, if I placed my opponent in check because I am not trying to overwhelm, at this point.  That will come later.  On the other hand, I am attacking his c2 pawn, and that is the reason that I did not retreat my queen or place him in check.} 23. Rhc1 {! This is very solid because it protects his c2 pawn and prevents me from finding an immediate mating sequence.  If he had not moved his rook, I might have found an immediate mating pattern, with my knight and queen after 23...QxP.} Qb5+ {At this point, I am trying to find a mating solution, against him.  Like my game against binblaster, his king is now exposed, and the position reminds of that game.  This position also seems very familiar to me, in terms of, "Fool's Mate", even though this is not an FM.} 24. Kf3 {He also could have played 24...Kd3, but it does not make a difference.  I will continue to check him, in my attempt to find a mating pattern.  Even if it is a nuisance check that does not mate him, I want to continue because of my, "Scare Tactics".  What do, "Scare Tactics" mean?  A, "Scare Tactic" is a strategy that is used to make your opponent feel anxious.  In other words, I want him to get nervous and worried so that he will make mistakes, and that is, btw, my strategy.  If I am successful, I will be able to mate him quickly, and that will happen during the end of this game.  This is how ubermensch43 defeated me, in a coaching game.  Although he did not mate me, he preoccupied my defenses, so I was forced to resign, in the second game. } Qf5+ {I am still trying to come up with a solution, and I thought I found one.  I quickly figured out, however, that this move does not mate him, but it will force him to play 25.Ke2, this time. } 25. Ke2 Qh5+ {? Therefore, I decided to take advantage by placing him in another check because I am still trying to preoccupy him.  However, this is a mistake, and I will explain it shortly.} 26. f3 {When I played 25...Qh5+, I originally thought that he would be forced to move his queen.  However, I forgot about his f2, so I just wasted a move.} g6 {I advance my g6 pawn to develop my DSB.} 27. Rcf1 {? He probably moved his c1 rook to prevent a fork because he was worried that I was going to play a powerful fork with Bb2, "sooner or later", as it is said.  However, I was not interested in playing a fork because I had better plans. } Bg7 {? I also could have played Bh6, instead of Fianchettoing my DSB.  However, I did not want to exchange bishops.  I wanted to exchange his rook for my bishop, instead.  On the other hand, I missed an immediate mating sequence.  I could have mated him in about two or three moves, if I had played 27...Nc3+.} 28. Kd3 {He moved his king, so that I could not play 28...Nc3+.  However, I still have a couple more tricks.} Qd5+ {This is part of my, "Scare Tactics" strategy.  I could have captured his rook with 28...Bxa1, but I decided to place him another check so that he would feel overwhelmed.  Unlike before, I will be successful, this time.  I will explain it this shortly. } 29. Bd4 {?? I originally thought he would be forced to play 29.Ke2.  Then, if 29.Ke2, 29...Bxa1, winning his rook.  If I had taken his rook, I still would have used, "Scare Tactics", until he felt preoccupied.  However, "This looses immediately", as Jack Stockel would say.  That is because I now have an inevitable mating sequence against him and I will mate in 2.  The solution is 29...Qxd4+, 30.Ke2 (forced), 30...Qd2#.  In addition, this is where I applied the final chess tactic training because I was able to complete an exercise with a similar mating solution. } Qxd4+ 30. Ke2 Qd2# {I used to do chess tactic exercises, but I failed the excercise many times. Therefore, I stopped doing them, at one point.  However, I gave it another chance because I had to miss the chess club, with Mr. Stockel for a month.  As a result, started to do the exercises, and I am getting better, each time. In some cases, I am able to complete 5 consecutive exercises (5 exercises in a row). I feel that it is also helping me to become better at this game because some of the exercises have similar positions to what Mr. Stockel teaches. In addition, I am using some of these tactics in my games, and it is making a huge difference.  In fact, I have remembered them to defeat a couple of opponents.  This game is an example.}
