1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bd3 g6 7. O-O Bg7 8. Be3 Ng4 {Let's attack that bishop since it's tied down defending the knight.} 9. Qf3 {He has to defend the bishop.} Nxe3 10. Qxe3 {I thought he might have taken with pawn here, creating an attack on f7.} e6 {Don't want to block my bishop's diagonal and want to restrict movement of his knight on c3.} 11. Nce2 {Is he thinking of a king side attack now?} O-O 12. c3 {Freeing his queen but blocking the square for the knight.} Bd7 {Preparing for Nc6.} 13. f4 Bh6 {Let's pin that pawn.} 14. Qf3 Qb6 {Let's pin that knight!} 15. Kh1 Nc6 {Hoping for NxN and also defending e5.} 16. f5 {Hmmm, I'm not keen on this..} Ne5 {He'll play Qh3 then f6?} 17. Qg3 {He wants to pin my pawn.} Kh8 18. fxg6 Rfg8 {Things are looking up.} 19. Nf4 Bxf4 {My 'good' bishop but worth the swap at this stage I think.} 20. Rxf4 Rxg6 {I can double up the rooks on this file later.} 21. Qe3 Ng4 {I can fork the rook and knight next move.} 22. Qf3 Ne5 23. Qf1 {Now he's putting pressure on f7.} Rg7 24. b3 Rc8 {Okay, let's put some pressure on the other side.} 25. Rc1 Qa5 26. c4 Qxa2 {Nabbing this pawn proves very useful later on.} 27. Rc2 Qa5 28. h3 {He must be guarding against Ng4 here.} Rg3 {Attacking the bishop.} 29. Nf3 {I can't allow 30. NxN.} Nxd3 30. Qxd3 Qa1+ 31. Kh2 Qg7 {Back to defend the rook and pawn.} 32. Qf1 {Unpinning the knight and preparing to attack f7 again.} e5 {Let's foil that.} 33. Rh4 f5 {Trying to do something useful with my backward pawn.} 34. Qf2 f4 {It's become very useful!} 35. Qb6 {A last throw of the dice?} Bxh3 {Defending the pawn and smashing open his king's defences.} 36. Rxh3 Rxh3+ 37. gxh3 Qg3+ {That useful pawn again!} 38. Kh1 Qxf3+ 39. Rg2 Rg8 40. Qf2 Qxh3+ 41. Kg1 Rxg2+ 42. Qxg2 Qxb3 {Now I get the benefit of taking the pawn on a2 earlier. The path's clear for my pawn on the a-file.} 43. Qg5 Qg3+ {Forcing the queen swap. Time for him to resign.} 44. Qxg3 fxg3 45. Kg2 a5 46. Kxg3 a4 {}
