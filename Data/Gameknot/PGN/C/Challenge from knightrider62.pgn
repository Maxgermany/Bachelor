[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {As usual, white follows with the KPO.} e5 {What I anticipated.  The Siclian Defense is also good.  But, most players at Steve's rating answer with the KPG.  Now, I'm an unusual character because when I first started and was very pompous, I mean the worst it gets, it was Siclian.  And, one thing that hasn't changed me about me is this being my favorite defense since I'm most used to it.  As a rule of thumb, I go by what elyhim said which is, "Stick with what you know."  However, for anyone at or below 1200, this is the move that I recommend because 1.c6 has more complicated variations to follow.} 2. Nf3 {I seem to recall teaching Sue that 2.Nf3 is the most common response to the last two moves which makes me proud of her.} f6 {?? But, Steve made a terrible blunder.  In fact, this should cost him the game.  It's called the Dominano's Defense.  And, what's wrong with this is that he's not developing or controlling the center.  Not only that, but as you learned with TA's Q sac, he's removing his weakes pawn which is a recipe for disaster.  In doing so, black could and should be severly punished.  This is going to be difficult to figure out as it's a move that you would not expect.  But, how should white proceed, Sue?} 3. Bc4 {I did mention that it's good to develop and castle.  But, this is an exception to those guidelines with black's last blunder.  So, best was, believe it or not, 3.Nxe5  You're probably thinking, now why would I play this.  Aside from moving the Knight twice, it loses a piece for pawn.  It's not that easy, and this is how I once thought before needing to be taught, otherwise, by cmethan.  In fact, this is something that I recently taught to a student before the second game, where I copied and pasted your post at, "The Deeper Chess Theory Club" to help him learn.  But, if after you capture on e5, he takes back with 3...fxe5??, you can bring out the Queen, at once, with 4.Qh5+, and no matter what black does, Steve is in a lot of trouble.  The most common move would be 4...g6, but then, you fork and win his Rook with 5.Qxe5+  And, if he plays 4...Ke7, you could answer with 5.Qf7+ and white wins quickly.  So, there's a lot you can do.  } Ne7 {Keeping that Rook safe, which eliminates the danger after Qh5+.  I believe that Steve saw this mistake and played this to prevent Sue from exploiting it.  I'm just trying to base it on cognition, as to, why he might have played this.} 4. d4 {Opening up her center.  But, a general guideline is to open up the center, after you've castled, Sue.  Now, there are times to deviate and where pushing the d2 pawn first is good.  But, in this position, I would've tucked the monarch away, at once.} b6 {I like this fianchetto though because my idea is, in general, forming the longest diagnol for the Bishop.} 5. Be3 {Continuing with her development.} Bb7 {So does he.} 6. Nc3 {The idea is still the same as before.} a5 {?! But, for Steve this move is pointless.  Instead, he could've used that time to develop his Nb8 because he's advancing a flank pawn before continuing his development or castling.  If I recall correctly, Joe mentioned something about that as to how, one of his opponents went wrong in a Q sac post.} 7. Nb5 {Preventing Steve from attacking her Bc4 since it is well placed.  And, Sue is also adding a defender to her d4.} Ba6 {?! Trying to exchange.  But, this is an inaccuracy because 1.e4 often leads to open positions, as I also learned from Joe.  Therefore, a bishop is worth more, so if Sue accepts, Steve could win, in the long run, find himself in trouble.} 8. dxe5 {With that being said, I would've castled.  For one thing, it's what I'm most used.  But, it also blends in with Reverse Psychology in allowing that exchange (as that's what I'd want), in this position, because I would find it beneficial.} fxe5 9. Be2 {I am not sure why Sue played this, but my guess is to coordinate the center better since it's the second piece directly in the center.  Now, that coordination brings you a step closer to controlling the center, as I've learned from GM Judit Polgar.} Nbc6 {Continuing with his development.} 10. Nc3 {Seeing that Steve will not exchange, afterall, Sue further organizes the center since the Knight is closer to that area.} Ng6 {Unblocking his Bf8.} 11. a4 {Preventing 11...b4} Nb4 {Unlike before, I don't know why Steve played this.  Personally, I would've pinned white's Nc3 with 11...Bb4.} 12. Bd2 {Preventing the possiblity of that pin, at once.} c5 {Connecting two pawns, so that, black has a pawn chain.  But, I would've completed my development, and then, castled, as black a while ago.} 13. O-O {Meanwhile, Sue waists no time in doing that.} Qf6 {Putting pressure against the f file.} 14. Ne1 {Taking some of that pressure off.} Nf4 {Threatening Sue's Be2.  Before, it wasn't a problem because if he took, and she took recaptured, it would be even.  But, with this move, the threat is the loss of a piece.  So, Sue protects it by forcing an exchange.} 15. Bxa6 Rxa6 16. Nb5 {Threatening a nasty fork.  } Bd6 {Which Steve prevents.} 17. Bc3 {Adding pressure to black's center.} Ke7 {I'm not sure why Steve played this.  It's not an endgame which makes the monarch vulnerable to exposure.  Therefore, I would've castled here.} 18. Nd3 {Sue's intends to exchange one of Steve's Knight because of them are a liability, in this position.} Qg6 {So, Steve tries to decline by threatening mate.  But, Sue refutes that.  Instead of opening, she exchanges which is what I also would've done.} 19. Nxf4 exf4 20. Nxd6 Rf8 {Adding pressure on the f file.} 21. f3 {Which Sue stops.} b5 {? I'm not sure why Steve advanced this pawn.  But, it's a mistake because white can win a pawn.} 22. Nb7 {With that being said Sue, better was 22.axb5 or 22.Nxb5} Qg5 {Steve is protecting c5 and building attacking forces against Sue's King.  The idea being is that 23...Rg6 threatens mate, and from there, it's not easy to drive off.  The best move would be 24.Rf2, but even so, white would still be faced with some difficult decisions.} 23. Qd3 {?? I'm not sure why white played this, but this is a blunder, Sue because of what's about to unfold.  Much better was 23.Qe2 which solves the difficulty, if black were then to play 23...Rg6.} Nxd3 24. cxd3 b4 {Going after Sue's Bc3.  But, I, however, would've exchanged with 24...bxa4 to eliminate a danger that black could later face with white's a4 since pawns like this advance, sooner or later, as I had to learn with Jack Stockel.} 25. Bd2 Rg6 {But, now that the Queen is gone, white faces the threat.} 26. g3 {And, while it might not seem so, there are compromises on white's position.} fxg3 27. Bxg5+ Rxg5 28. Nxa5 Rf4 {While white is now ahead, instead of this move, much better was 28...g2 winning quickly as black has a passed pawn.  After all, it can't be captured.  Then, with white's Rf1 being forced to retreat, 29...Rxf3! becomes possible with both Rooks and the passed pawn against his King, Steve would've had a forced win from there.  But, by playing this, Sue has compensated as she remains a piece up.} 29. Nb7 {Trying to increase her edge, Sue keeps in mind that she has a passed pawn that was blocked by her N.  By moving it, her a4 becomes dangerous, especially since, it's behind a Rook.  This is where the saying, "A rook behind passed pawn applies."  You'll note that I'm not abandoning chess terms or bag of chess quotes but the idea is blending them right in with the overall picture as it's part of figuring out the entire story that the board is revealing since passers are very dangerous as they're what you use to promote.} Rh4 {Renewing that threat.} 30. a5 {?? Focused on promoting the pawn, but there's more the story then meets the eye, Sue.  The real threat involves the Rooks close to each other, as well as, his g3.  By black should be able to win.  So, should Steve proceed?} Rxh2 {With that being said, best was 30...gxh2+!, after which, white winds up in trouble.} 31. a6 {But, now that black didn't take the other way, there's nothing wrong with this move.  White is showing some good effort, and I'm proud of her.} g2 {? still trying to promote, black pushes his pawn.  But, this is a mistake because it allows white to liquidate while ahead.  So, what is the best move, Sue?   } 32. Rfe1 {?? Protecting the Rook but best was 32.Kxh2!, and if 32...gxf1=Q+, white can answer with 33.Rxf1 and keep the initiative.  But, this is a blunder as black will be able to promote starting with the next move since Steve's g2 was very dangerous and had to be watched.  However, it's not lost yet, and with best play, Sue should still win this game.} Rh1+ 33. Kf2 Rxe1 34. Rxe1 {While not right away, and although difficult, black is still going to promote.} h5 {It starts with this move since a pawn chain is starting to form.  Once, he can push to h3, you have a chain, so that after promoting, if white takes, black would repromote with the g pawn since they would be connected.} 35. f4 {Trying to get a second passed pawn by attacking the Rook.} Rg4 {But, Steve puts a stop to that.} 36. f5 {And, now, despite only having one passed pawn her d3-f5 are just as dangerous because the pawn chain is something to also be weary because these things often result in a passed pawn, especially, if white's to push e4-e6, then black takes, and white recaptures, then you've got the other set.  That passed pawn would be even more dangerous then what's on a6.} g5 {Trying to get a third set of passed pawns from black.  But, Steve overlooked that white can capture here.} 37. a7 {I know that you're really determined to promote, but best was to hold off and take with 37.fxg6 e.p.,  Yes, an en-pessant capture could've been made since he's moved two square.} h4 {Meanwhile, as noted before, black is starting his dangerous pawn chain which will become a reality on his next move.} 38. a8=Q {Knowing what's coming, Sue promotes, at once.  But, as noted his other pawns are what's overwhelming.} h3 39. Qd8+ {Doing what she can to stop black from promoting a series of checks.  But, he will one way or another.  The good part, though, is that while not easy, white could still win, up to here.} Kf7 40. Nd6+ Kg7 41. f6+ Kg6 42. Qe7 {?? This, however, is the losing blunder.  Up until now, white had the intitative.  But, by playing this, and with his Rg4, g and h pawns, Steve's attacks against Sue is overwhelming.  Best was 42.f7, as Sue would promote due to her Nd6, and then if 42...h2 (which is happening), white would win, after 43.f8=Q because if 43...h1=Q, white answers with 44.Qf7#, which is mate.  Even if he did stop mate, for the time being, white still forces a win.  but, by playing this, he is going to promote, one way or another, with what I noted earlier.  After that, it's mate, soon after. } h2 {Therefore, it starts with this move.} 43. f7 {This was best a move earlier.  But, now what was good a move prior, doesn't work anymore.  It's worth noting that chess is like that, but especially, in close games like this.  The same thing happened when I played against Brendan, except that it was the other way around.  So, there was no room for errors, as otherwise, I'd lose.  Therefore, there was only one way to win.  But, I found the move.  I mention that because this is a similar position.} h1=Q 44. Rxh1 gxh1=Q 45. f8=Q {It's unusual to see three Queen's on the board but not impossible.  However, it's mate and black has that sequence.} Qg1+ 46. Ke2 Rg2+ 47. Kf3 Qf2# {So, both sides made blunders.  But, the overall moral to this story is something that Jack Stockel emphasized to me which I then noted.  In the endgame, you need to be more careful then other phases of the game.  That's because in the opening and mid games, you can usually wiz your way out of a mistake.  But, in the end, there's usually no way out.  So, one mistake there will often determine the final outcome.}
