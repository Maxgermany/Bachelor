[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03)"]

1. e4 Nf6 {Alekhine's defense.  Most of white's responses tend to be pretty good for black.} 2. e5 {...except this move.  Black typically responds with Nd5.} Nd5 {...just like that.} 3. d4 e6 4. Nf3 c6 5. Bd2 Na6 {With this move white can clear the space between king and rook in preparation for castling while doubling black's pawns.  In general positioning a knight against the side of the board really restricts its field of play.} 6. Bxa6 bxa6 7. O-O h5 {Black could continue thrusting this pawn down against the king's castle, but never moves it again.} 8. a4 {I have no idea what white was thinking here.} a5 9. Qe1 {Disaster!  Black can now trade a bishop for white's trapped f rook.  White moved the queen here eying black's a pawn, but it was a blunder.} Ba6 {The rook is as good as gone.  Interposing c4 just gives black more material.  White does get Pa5, though.  Small consolation.} 10. Bxa5 {Here black should play Qb8, and attack Pb2.} Qf6 {The lesson here is to survey the board before pressing the "submit" button.  Black's turn to blunder.  White is still smarting over the impending bishop/rook exchange.} 11. exf6 gxf6 12. Nbd2 {White can now safely interpose c4 to protect the rook.  White's other (much poorer) choice would have been Kh1, or Q somewhere.} Rb8 {Down 9 points, I think black is still advised to swap the bishop for rook.} 13. c4 Nf4 {White forks black's rook and knight with Bc7.} 14. Bc7 Rb7 {?  Black looked like she wanted RxPb2.  While only a pawn, Nf4 is lost.  Black ought to take something, if she cannot counterattack a stronger piece.} 15. Bxf4 e5 {Here I am partial to Bb4.  This pins Nd2 (against Qe1) from responding to BxPc4, again with white's trapped f rook.} 16. dxe5 f5 17. Bg5 d5 {Black probably forgot exd6 e.p.+.} 18. exd6 e.p.+ Kd7 19. Be7 Bxe7 20. dxe7 Ke8 {Re8 might have been a better response.} 21. Qe5 Rg8 22. Rfe1 c5 {So many pawns, so little time.} 23. Qxc5 f6 24. Qxf5 Rxe7 25. Qxh5+ Kd7 26. Qd5+ Ke8 27. Qxg8+ Kd7 28. Rad1 {}
