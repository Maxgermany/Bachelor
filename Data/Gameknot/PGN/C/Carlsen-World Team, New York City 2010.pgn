[Opening "King's Indian, 3.Nf3 (E60)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 {This is the Indian Defence. White is strengthening his control of the centre.} g6 {However, the World Team chooses to ready its dark-squared bishop for a fianchetto.} 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. g3 {White prepares to do the same with his light-squared bishop.} O-O 5. Bg2 d6 {An interesting move by Black, as it stops White's knight on f3 coming to e5, but White can play d5 if he chooses to, creating a powerful pawn near Black's territory. Of course, Black could always move a pawn forward to challenge it, but, in this game, we'll see that White does eventually move his pawn there, but it will stay there for the better part of the game.} 6. Nc3 Nc6 {Both moves have been good, centralising ones.} 7. O-O e5 {Black now invites White to open up the position, though Black's position will be quite exposed to attacks by White.} 8. d5 {Carlsen refuses. This move not only pressures Black's knight onto a less powerful square, it also forces the World Team to perhaps think a little longer than they usually would.} Ne7 9. e4 {White's position is now very solid.} c6 10. a4 {A quiet move. It begins to build a defence against Black's queenside pawns, but it also lets the rook come out.} Bg4 11. a5 {This move is very sound, as White has extended his pawn a big distance towards Black's territory.} cxd5 12. cxd5 {Note that if 12. exd5 Black would have a powerful pawn on e5 which could be extended to e4.} Qd7 {This move backs up the bishop on g4 and stops White's knight on c3 coming to b5.} 13. Be3 Rfc8 14. Qa4 {The position is fairly equal here, and White looks to trade queens.} Ne8 15. Nd2 {This move gives the Black bishop more scope, but it can now be driven off with White's pawn moving to f3.} Qd8 16. Qb4 Nc7 17. Nc4 {White now threatens to capture the pawn on d6 with either queen or knight. Note that White could have taken the pawn on b7 with 17. Qxb7 but Black can then play 17. ... Rcb8 and capture the pawn on b2 after the queen moves away, putting a good rook deep into White's territory.} Na6 18. Qxb7 {White now captures the pawn, as Black can't play 18. ... Rcb8 because White could capture the knight on a6.} Rxc4 19. Qxa6 Rb4 20. f3 Bc8 21. Qe2 f5 22. Qd2 {If 22. ... fxe4 White plays 23. Nxe4 and the queen attacks the rook.} Ba6 23. Rfc1 Qb8 24. Na4 Rb3 25. Rc3 Rb4 26. Rca3 f4 27. Bf2 Bh6 28. Nb6 {White now threatens to capture Black's rook on a8. If Black plays 28. ... axb6 White's queen can capture the rook on b4.} fxg3 {It is fruiteless to try to save the rook, as 28. ... Rb5 is met with 29. Bf1. Black instead chooses to put pressure on White's king.} 29. Qxb4 gxf2+ 30. Kxf2 Bc8 {Black's rook is immune to capture as it would allow White's queen to be taken.} 31. Rb3 axb6 32. Qxb6 Qa7 33. a6 Kf7 34. Qxa7 {More than a simple exchange, White has removed Black's best defender.} Rxa7 35. Rb6 Ke8 36. Rxd6 Bf8 37. Rb6 Nxd5 {If 38. exd5 Black plays 38. ... Bc5, forking White's king and rook.} 38. Rb8 {A brilliant move by White. Black now has to mount a defence, but White has seen further into it than that.} Bc5+ 39. Kg3 Ne7 40. Bh3 Kd8 41. Bxc8 Nxc8 42. Rc1 {A very good move by White. Black only has one response to stop him from losing the bishop.} Rc7 {Black's rook really was all the good defence he had left.} 43. Rxc5 {White sacrifices his rook. The bishop was the only piece that could stop his plan.} Rxc5 44. a7 {At this point, resignation was handed in. Black's knight is pinned to his king and so can't capture the pawn. If 44. ... Ra5 White plays 45. a8=Q and wins Black's rook. There was a good deal of strategy in this game, and the fact that three grandmasters came up with moves for an online audience to vote on made it impossible for people to vote on ridiculous moves. Or, at least, it was highly unlikely. Carlsen was the victor that day and simply added it to his long list of achievements.
