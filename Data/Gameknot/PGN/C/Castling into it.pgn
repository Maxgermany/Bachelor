1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. Bg5 e5 5. d5 Be7 6. Bb5 {6. Bb5?misses Black's tactical shot...} Nxd5 {Wins a pawn, if NxN, then BXB, and if BxB, NxB.} 7. Bxd7+ Bxd7 8. Bxe7 Nxe7 9. h3 O-O 10. Nf3 f5 {Black wants to contest the center with the extra pawn.} 11. Nd5 fxe4 {Expecting NxN , QxN Qd5 } 12. Nxe7+ Qxe7 13. Nd2 {Expectied Qd5 , this retreat seems passive given  the material deficit.} d5 14. Qe2 Qf6 15. c4 c6 16. a4 {16 a4?!, I think simply 0-0 is better.} Qg6 {To weaken White's kingside and possibly double the rooks on the f file.} 17. g4 Rf4 18. O-O-O {A fateful decision to castle 0-0-0 since the king is exposed, but 0-0 would have left the king too exposed.} Raf8 {...Rf8!? Perhaps too routine, in retrospect I think ..Qd6! threatening an immediate attack on the king is stronger.} 19. Rh2 d4 {I played ...d4!? thinking I could just bust open the center and attack the king after b5. While this plan did work, ..Qd6! is still stronger.} 20. Re1 b5 21. axb5 cxb5 22. cxb5 d3 {...d3!? is the point of the plan, now Black can take on b5 and the king will be exposed.} 23. Qe3 Bxb5 24. Nxe4 d2+ {...d2 !?, to open up lines of attack. I was hoping for Nxp??, Rc8 . } 25. Qxd2 {Now if .. RxN??, Qd5 ! So Black needs another plan.} Qa6 {Protects the Bishop and threatens a check along the a file.} 26. Qd5+ {White wants to centralize the queen and open up bank rate mate possibilities if Black is careless.} Kh8 27. Nc3 {Relying on this move to hold everything together, but this move does not work.} Qa1+ {The start of a winning combination...} 28. Nb1 Rc8+ 29. Kd2 {If Kd1, QxN  and similar to game.} Qxb2+ 30. Ke3 {Forced. If Qc3  were possible, mate would follow, so...} Rc3+ {forced} 31. Nxc3 Qxc3+ 32. Qd3 {forced} Qxd3# {}
