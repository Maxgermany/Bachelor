1. e4 {I was very astonished when I saw this game, as I never thought a Greek Gift Sacrifice would come up so fast.} e5 2. Nf3 d5 {Elephant Defense.} 3. exd5 Bd6 {Not a move of the main line I know of..} 4. Bc4 e4 5. Nd4 Nf6 6. O-O {A very bad blunder here. If you are under 1500, think about black's next move.} Bxh2+ 7. Kh1 {Kxh2 looks safer to me for some reason, partially because white got wiped out shortly after Kh1.} Ng4 8. Be2 {I thought f3 was better here, as 8.f3  Qh4 9. Qe2 looks safer.} Qh4 9. Bxg4 {To prevent Bg3+.} Bxg4 10. g3 {Nothing left to do here.} Bxg3+ 11. Kg2 Qh2# {As a moral, you should always look for sacrifices, even as early as move six. As funny as it seems, white put a comment saying she would win, but ended up losing this quickly.}
