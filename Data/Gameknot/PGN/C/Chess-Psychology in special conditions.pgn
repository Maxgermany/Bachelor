1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5 d6 6. O-O Bd7 7. d3 a6 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 9. Be3 Nf6 10. Kh1 Qd7 11. Qe1 {This has been a theoretical opening: The Grand Prix attack. More information on the actual tactics and calculations can be found in my previous game:Chess:How to play the game. This is a simul, so the coach will try to steer away from complications. He is normally bold enough in his play, but in a simul, his time is very limited to intuition, and does not have luxury of deep calculation. The tactics, whether sound or not, will usually helps me.} O-O-O 12. Rb1 h6 {Right now, the position is theoretically a nice advantage for white, and he should take the opportunity to race with 13.b4! cxb4 14.Rxb4 g5! with advantage to white, although the position is greatly imbalanced. The coach did not want to go for this line, however. Although unsound, my offer of tactics was unappealing.} 13. e5 {(?)Quite a concrete mistake, that gives away a lot of white's edge. The game is now equal. 13.b4! was much better. } Ng4 14. Bg1 dxe5 15. h3 h5 {(!)A strong move that keeps up the black initiative. To be honest, I did not calculate the variations during the game, but was sure it was good intuitively. I later discovered that 16.hxg4 hxg4+ 17.Nh2 exf4 18.Rxf4 Qd6 is the refutation for 19.Qd2 or something like this 19...Be5 could happen. However, I knew that a tactiacal attack was the last thing a player under tactical circmstances wanted in low time.} 16. Ne4 exf4 17. Bxc5 f5 18. Neg5 e5 19. Bb6 Rde8 {Enjoy the rest of the game. I will space out the boxes so you can see them.} 20. Qb4 Ne3 {.} 21. Rf2 e4 22. dxe4 {.} fxe4 23. Ng1 Nd5 24. Qc5 {.} Nxb6 25. Qxb6 Bd4 {This was just one game in which a master suffered from psychological influences that prevented him from playing his best. They say that simul masters only lose around 200 points of strength, during play, so he still should have won. The reason it did not happen is due to my tactical play. Although he would unlikely be so timid in a one on one real game, weaker players definitely will. Thus, look to the next game against a Class Player I won against some time ago. Psychology 2. I will explain some major misconceptions by made by weaker players; They are hard to get rid of completely, and I do them as well. However, consciously knowing about it will be beneficial.}
