[Opening "Queen's Gambit (D06)"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 Be6 {I cannot seem to find this move amongst the many Queen's Gambit openings, so I'm assuming he wants to go off-book quickly. Since I am not confident with many of the Q pawn variations, I decided to avoid miscalculating my ability to eventually take that pawn back or gain tempo/positional advantage over him.} 3. cxd5 Bxd5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Bg5 e6 6. Bxf6 {I deeply regretted this move. For no good reason, I just allowed him to develop the Queen against my under-developed King-side. It will prove to be a major bane to me in the mid-game.} Qxf6 7. e4 Bc6 8. Nf3 Bb4 9. Bd3 Qg6 {Basically shoved me into a corner with this move. Threatens Qxg2 while piling more pressure on e4 that he knows he will win by Bxc3.} 10. O-O {I think this is the best move under my circumstances, offering short-term defensive advantages but suffering from longer-term problems for the King (I just castled right into the guns of his Queen! Was thanking my lucky stars his bishop was not in position to take full advantage of it!) that I know I will have to carefully squirm away from.} Bxc3 11. e5 {Seriously, my decision to make this move left me wondering if I had calculated it right. I decided not to yield the pawn. That bishop's maximal remaining damage is a pawn + rook before it is taken. His Queen can take my bishop and otherwise did not seem in a position to do additional harm (ie. no Qxg2 sac magic seemed plausible on the horizon).  I was effectively trying to gain the necessary tempo to retake the piece while not losing the pawn.} f5 {He recognizes that in doing so, I've left my Knight and Pawn extremely vulnerable to the twin guns of the Queen and Bishop. So he wants to stay put.} 12. bxc3 {I figured I had that one move to retake the bishop while not compromising my King's safety.} Nd7 13. Rb1 {I was frantically looking for a way to relieve the pressure on the King defenses. Rb1 was intended to allow Bb5 to draw his bishop out of position or to simply exchange it away (which is nice, because that exchange would grant me tentative control of the b file.} O-O {This was scary ... he now had a rook supporting what is a potential pass-pawn.} 14. Bb5 Nb6 15. Bxc6 bxc6 16. Nd2 {I think this was to partially limit his options for advancing his Knight. At the same time, I was hoping this would buy me a way for f4 to hold back my opponent's f pawn.} Nd5 17. Rb3 {I was trying to defend my c pawn, but at the same time, I was painfully aware 16. ...,Nd5 gave him the license to push his f pawn further.} Nf4 {He aims for a kill.} 18. Qf3 {Not sure this was my best response. Will find out when I run the game through an engine to match my thoughts with "reality". I think I preferred this to g3 was because g3 allowed 18. ...,Nh3+ which shoves my King into a corner with no way of getting out and leaves me very vulnerable to a pretty devastating 19. ...,f4.} Qg5 {Protecting his Knight and gunning for a discovered attack on my dangling and undefended Knight at d2.} 19. Qxc6 {I think I calculated that my opponent did not have enough resources to properly execute Nh3+ and gain my Knight or apply a serious mate threat to my King. So, I quite suddenly became aggressive, taking a pawn and threatening to clean up his pawns (as long as I felt I had the tempo). Clearing the pawns there has the added advantage of increasing my b3 Rook's capabilities (currently very limited thanks to my pawn chain).} h5 {My opponent decides to be very aggressive too. I thought I was in rather serious trouble at this point. My only hope was to somehow pull his f4 Knight off it's perch so I could do a Qxe6+ and inflict more damage on him at the cost of his tempo.} 20. Kh1 {I think I was pre-empting Nh3+. I think I was also preparing for g3 to try and dislodge his Knight. While my King was at g1, g3 is a useless gesture and I was sure my opponent knows it!} h4 {The sound of "Jaws" echoed in my brain ...} 21. g3 {I had to think really hard about pushing this pawn, evaluating as many possible exchange variations as well as the possibilities of 21. g3,h3 (afterwhich if I brazenly did a 22. bxf4, I leave myself open to a mate trap the moment my queen leaves that diagonal)} hxg3 22. fxg3 {hxg3 would be extremely bad for me in the longer term.} Ne2 {I think this move was the first of his serious mistakes (see later).} 23. Qxe6+ {22. fxg3,Ne2 seemed to grant me sufficient time to take the pawn and force him to respond. I felt it safe to allow my Knight to dangle there a little longer.} Rf7 {I believe this was a 2nd mistake on his part. Kh8 or Kh7 should have granted him greater sanctuary and would avoid the Rook pin. This pin would prove instrumental in allowing me to fight back.} 24. Nf3 {Attacking the queen was a tertiary concern. The primary was getting my knight the hell out of there and my secondary concern was continuing to provide shelter to the King.} Qh5 {25. ...,Nxg3 forks King and Rook and gains a free pawn while he was at it. I had to prevent it.} 25. Kg2 f4 {I got lucky. Thanks to where my Queen was, I could get away with not taking the exchange so I could maintain a (now further weakened) pawn shield.} 26. g4 Qh6 27. Qc4 {I was considering the Queen exchange until I noticed his Knight really had nowhere to go if threatened! Hence my earlier comment about Ne2 being a mistake. The best part was I could do this while still maintaining that Rook pin.} Ng3 {I don't think this was the best response. Looking at this position now, I think he could be way better off passively giving up the Knight. 27. Qc4,g5 secures his lone pawn even in the face of the Rook pin. 28. Qxe2, which I may not do under the hypothetical circumstances, unpins his Rook and gives him time for 28. Qxe2,Kg7 29. ...,Rh8. I think that, if not stopped, would give his queen power over the h file to start tearing my King's defenses apart.} 28. hxg3 fxg3 29. Kxg3 Qf4+ {From this point on, I had to be extremely careful about allowing the conditions for perpetual check (given how 2 of my major pieces are more or less isolated from the action King-side).} 30. Kh3 g6 {I had hoped for 30. Kh3,Qh6+ 31. Nh4, making him lose the rook ... Now, the (very serious) threat was 31. ...,Kg7 32. ...,Rh8+.} 31. Nh2 {Hoping to skewer the Rook at f7. Note how the pin was making it just slightly tougher for me to properly reason about the threat posed by the Queen at various positions along the f file. What were moves normally too dangerous to make given a Queen + Rook had to be given a second look since the Rook cannot move.} Qh6+ 32. Kg3 Raf8 {Again, the pin prevented this move from being far more dangerous than it would normally have been.} 33. Rb7 {I knew he only had one option left after Raf8 ... he was going to unpin his King and the only way he could do it was via Kg7. Anything else loses him a rook. I calculated I had time for Rb7 followed by Rxc7 which, because of my Queen's protection (I got lucky again) granted me a 2nd pin on his King's intended position along the 7th row.} Kg7 34. Rxc7 Rxc7 35. Qxc7+ Kg8 36. Rxf8+ {I had to think long and hard about 36. Rxf8+. I had to make sure I had sufficient time to move my queen into a more effective position (note that it cannot reach back to cover the King if some perpetual check scenario was possible).} Kxf8 37. Qd8+ {Kf7 or Kg7 both left him vulnerable for the followup Qf6+ which gave me the peace of mind I needed (not 100% though) regarding the King.} Kf7 38. Qf6+ Kg8 39. e6 {Again, I had to ensure it was safe to start pushing pawns.} Qe3+ 40. Nf3 {40. Nf3 brilliantly (I didn't plan this, but I was so glad it panned out the way it did) secures all close-range diagonal attack squares (my greatest problem) on the King.} Qxc3 {Opens another diagonal to attack the King from c7. Thankfully, Kh3 is the eventual appropriate response.} 41. Qf7+ {}
