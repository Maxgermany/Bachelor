1. e4 e6 2. f4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 {Black chose ... } Bd7 {This seems like an odd move. } 5. Nf3 Be7 {Equally good are Qb6, Nc6 and Nh6, and some of these may transpose. } 6. a3 Nh6 7. d4 Nf5 8. Bd3 O-O {Qb6, a5, c4 and Nc6 are viable alternatives. } 9. Kf2 {Castling is the better move.  It remains to be seems though if black can exploit the position of the king, which for now looks perfectly safe.  } Nc6 {Qb6 is also good. } 10. Bxf5 exf5 11. Be3 Qb6 {Best. } 12. b4 c4 {Black has a tiny edge. } 13. h3 {White neglects his development.   13. Nbd2 was better. } a5 14. Nbd2 Qa6 15. Qc2 {15. Qb1 Is better. } axb4 16. axb4 {Because white keeps making poor choices, he is now lost.  16. cxb4 Is better.  } Qxa1 17. Rxa1 Rxa1 18. g4 Rfa8 19. e6 {White lashes out with a bad move followed by another bad move. } fxe6 {This choice gets rids of the doubled pawns and leaves the d7 bishop more free. } 20. Ne5 {White can do a little better with Nxc4 and Qe2 to shelter the queen. } Nxe5 21. dxe5 Ra8a2 {}
