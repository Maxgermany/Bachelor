1. e4 d6 {1.  d6 (a Pirc Defense)} 2. d4 {2. d4 (a standard response)} Nf6 {2.  Nf6 is the Lion's Defense as pointed out by dmaestro!} 3. Nc3 {3. Nc3 develops and defends the pawn on e4.} g6 4. Bd3 Bg7 5. f4 {5. f4 - standard developing moves and the push to f4 make this the 3 pawns attack variation of the Pirc as pointed out to me by my opponent.} Nc6 6. Bb5 a6 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 {On move 6 I initiated a combination that would break up black's pawn structure after black recaptured by 7. ........ b x c6.} 8. Nf3 {8. Nf3 (develops and defends d4).  Over the next few moves the emphasis is on development.} O-O 9. O-O h6 10. Be3 a5 11. Qd2 Ng4 {11. Ng4 (a knight incursion so I kick it away with h3 and after an exchange of bishop for knight black develops his bishop to b7) on move 13.} 12. h3 Nxe3 13. Qxe3 Bb7 14. Rad1 {14. Rad1 (can be advisable to put your rook on the same file as the enemy queen - after pawn exchanges who knows what tactics can be used against the queen).  Next move I centralise the other rook.} Qd7 15. Rfe1 a4 16. a3 Rfb8 {16. .......... Rfb8 (suddenly it looks as if he wants to attack down the b file with his rook which he does eventually with disastrous results).  Wayne said that on the previous move I should have moved my pawn to b3 to prevent 15. a4.} 17. Ne2 {17. Ne2 bolsters the d pawn and opens a defense line to my a3 pawn.} Ba6 {17. .......... Ba6 puts pressure on the e2 knight and opens up the b file to black's king rook which attacks the b pawn and I have to defend with Rb1} 18. Rdb1 c5 19. c3 cxd4 20. cxd4 Rb3 {After I played 18. Rb1 Wayne put more pressure on d4 by playing c5.  I played c3 and there was an exchange of pawns.  Now comes the deadly incursion 20. ........ Rb3.} 21. Qd2 {21. Qd2 (the queen moves out of the line of fire and bolsters b2 but now comes a stunning exchange sacrifice!)} Rd3 22. Qc2 Rxf3 {22. ........ Rxf3 - and here it is!!} 23. gxf3 Qxh3 24. Qxc7 {24.  Here I try to counterattack with Q x c7?? and this puts pressure on the e7 pawn.  Ion suggested that I should have defended the f3 pawn with my king instead of taking on c7.  Black would have had the better endgame though.  I now pay with my king.} Bxe2 25. Rxe2 Bxd4+ 26. Rf2 {26. Rf2 (the only move)} Qg3+ 27. Kh1 Bxf2 {After 27. ....... B x f2 its Qh3# next move so as I value my king I elect to resign.  This I feel is a lesson in when and when not to counterattack.}
