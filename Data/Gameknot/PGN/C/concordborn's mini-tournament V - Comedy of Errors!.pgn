1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is another annotation in the themed Sicilian Pelikan MT.  Although this is certainly not one of my best games, I thought I would annotate it to give you guys a bit of light relief.  Life, is about taking the rough with the smooth, both on and off the chessboard.  I certainly ended up doing this in this game.  I will begin the commentary with my 7th move as the first 6 moves are forced.  You can also follow the game with gameknot analysis as follows:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17599933&rnd=0.24172412757283301} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 {7. Bg5 - again I play the move which is the most popular, and I note from my previous annotation that this is a very strong move because it puts pressure on both f6 and d6 and not to mention a fork on c7 should the Wicked Witch of the West recapture on f6.} a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5 {9. Nd5 - as in my previous annotation I end up putting a knight on d5.} Be7 10. Nxe7 Nxe7 {10. Nxe7 - knight trade.} 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Qf3 f5 13. exf5 Nxf5 {13. ...... Nxf5?? - after a pawn trade black recaptures with the wrong unit.  Bxf5 was the correct move.  I overlooked this move - a rare oversight from yours truly and I was stewing in my own juice for a good week or so.  The reason for this oversight was that I was focussed on the square d4 and I wanted to prevent the black knight from landing on it.  I totally overlooked the fact that Glenda could safely take the rook on a8!  Aaarrgh and treble aaargh!} 14. c3 {14. c3 ??? - the extra question mark is because I am absolutely furious with myself.} Be6 15. g3 O-O {15. ..... 0-0 - as the Nolan sisters used to sing "Gotta pull myself together!".  How, I know not because the position looks dead level and even though the BK is dangerously exposed I haven't a scooby as to how Glenda and Co. can exploit this.} 16. Bd3 Ng7 17. Nc2 {17. Nc2 - I spend the next two moves improving my development and the placement of my knight - this, I feel, is the quickest way to recover my composure after such a blunder.} f5 18. Be2 d5 19. Nb4 {19. Nb4 - creating pressure on d5.} e4 20. Qf4 {20. Qf4 - keeping Glenda on an active square.} Qd7 21. O-O {21. 0-0 - Henry finally castles on move 21 and the white rooks are now connected.  Maybe I can put more pressure on d5.  I must nag away at my opponent and hope he cracks again.} a5 22. Nc2 {22. Nc2 - heading for d4 in order to put pressure on b5.} Rf7 23. Nd4 {23. Nd4 - this move also threatens to trade off black's potentially strong bishop for my knight.  However, my opponent made the following oversight .......} Rb8 {23. ..... Rb8?? - Black defends his b pawn with his rook.  However, I spot that the rook is hanging and this time Glenda makes no mistake and black instantly waves the white flag ...... Whew and treble whew!} 24. Qxb8+ {}
