1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {here, in the Gruenfeld, black begins to fight for center control with plans to control d4} 4. Nf3 c5 {deserves a double question mark.  clearly best is ...Bg7.} 5. dxc5 {white accepts the invitation and marches forward.  the black pawn is now pinned, though normally white is not keen to give up the Q, even while preventing black from castling.} Nc6 {trying to contain white and start pressure on d4, an attempt to stay with the spirit of the defense.} 6. e3 Bg7 7. Be2 Bf5 8. O-O O-O {black has to protect himself, though ...dxc4, ...d4, or ...e6 may have been better.} 9. cxd5 Nxd5 {while this opens up the diagonal for the Indian B, this loses points for black.  maybe ...Nb4 would have helped though the advancing pawns make white even more pleased} 10. Nxd5 Qd7 {an awful tactical blunder, especially when white entices the black B to leave the Q hanging, open to the fork} 11. e4 Bxe4 12. Nf6+ Bxf6 13. Qxd7 Rfd8 14. Qg4 {white doesn't waste time taking the b7 pawn} Bf5 15. Qc4 Rd7 {aiming to create a battery.  a more forcing move e.g...Na5 might have helped.} 16. Rd1 Rad8 {white is happy to take the rook} 17. Rxd7 Rxd7 18. Ng5 {adding pressure to f7 via mate threat} Ne5 {the black pieces get tied up here.  ...e6 may have been adequate} 19. Qb3 Kg7 20. f4 {the black N can't move with the threat so } Bxg5 21. fxe5 {the B is hanging.  ...Bh6 keeps a foothold.  the black rook needs to get into the game } e6 22. Bxg5 {the black king is getting boxed in} h6 {this just encourages white} 23. Bf6+ Kh7 24. Rd1 {white develops his last piece} Rc7 {this actually decreases the rook's effect on the game} 25. Rd8 {mate in one threat} g5 {trying to create a flight square.} 26. Rh8+ Kg6 27. g4 {restricts the king even more while threatening the B.  black is gasping} Be4 28. Bf3 {no hope.  ...Bxf3 would create a diversion but also lose black's only active piece} Bd5 29. Qd3+ Be4 30. Qxe4# {so much for that.  thanks to my gentleman opponent for being so helpful.  we'll see what transpires next time}
