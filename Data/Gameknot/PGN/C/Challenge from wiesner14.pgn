1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 cxb2 5. Bxb2 {I usually opt for the Semi-Danish line recapturing the "hungry pawn" on move three at c3 but was feeling a bit ambitious this day(due to some good Wheaties) and decided to sac all it took for strong development} Qe7 6. Qb3 Qxe4+ 7. Ne2 {Here Alco has wasted to much time already with queen moves. I play Ne2 looking to further develop my pieces for a full attack(maybe even a possible rook sac on h8) after Qxg2} Qe7 8. Nbc3 c6 9. O-O Nf6 {c6 and Nf6 are Alco's first attempts at fighting for the center. I can't let him occupy the d5 square strongly } 10. Rfe1 Kd8 {Alco sees the threat of his queen being pinned down on the e-file. With all my pieces being developed all I have to do is utilize my rooks now} 11. a4 {Threatening to put my bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal} Qb4 {If I move to avoid the trade of queens I lose my tempo so although I do not want to trade my queen it's the only option. } 12. Bxf7 {Only down 2 pawns now and still have superb development} Qxb3 13. Bxb3 {Queens are traded but my development is still extremely strong and Alco's king is a sitting duck in the middle of the board} Bb4 14. Rad1 d5 15. Nf4 Ne4 {A blunder that will open up the d-file and allow me to regain another pawn I quickly realize} 16. Nfxd5 Nxc3 17. Bxc3 Bxc3 18. Nxc3+ Bd7 19. Re3 a6 20. a5 {His knight now won't be able to be developed for multiple moves so with a5 I hope to cramp his rook and knight together even more} Re8 21. Red3 Kc7 22. Na4 Bg4 23. f3 Bf5 24. Rd3d2 Nd7 25. g4 Ne5 26. Kg2 Be6 27. Bxe6 Rxe6 28. f4 Nc4 29. Rd2d7+ Kb8 30. Nb6 Ne3+ {I saw this move coming but actually believed to have mate in two after he captures the rook. I was wrong as his king can go to c7 after Rd8+. } 31. Kf3 Nxd1 32. Rd8+ {At this point still with only the chance to be down a pawn in the end game and be at a huge disadvantage on the queenside I am content drawing my higher rated opponent} Kc7 33. Rd7+ Kb8 34. Rd8+ Kc7 35. Rd7+ Kb8 36. Rd8+ {}
