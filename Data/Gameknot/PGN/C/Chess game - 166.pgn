[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Andreaschek gambit"]

1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. Qxd4 {White decides to take the d-pawn with his Queen instead of playing the Morra gambit. (3.c3)} Nc6 {)...a questionable because he now must waste a move getting the Queen to safety while I am allowed to develop my knight with tempo.} 4. Qd1 d6 {I think 4...Nf6, 5.Nc3, e6, 6. Nf3, Bb4 is more common but I guess it’s just a matter of taste. In a rated match, I would most probably play 4...Nf6, but blitz matches provide a great opportunity to try out new lines.} 5. Bb5 Nf6 6. Nd2 {Because it does not block the path of the bishop, 6. Nc3 is clearly better.} g6 7. Bxc6+ {A positional mistake? My opponent now forfeits a potentially strong bishop pair and by letting me put a pawn on c6, helps me control the central d5 square.} bxc6 8. Qf3 Bg7 9. a3 {Some of us are guilty, especially in blitz games, for making quiet moves until either we can think of something to do or wait until our opponent shows his hand. a3 is one of these moves. Another of these moves is h3. Although h3 often provides an escape route for the kingside castled King, surely it is better to attempt a firm control on the centre/develop all of our pieces before our opponent has the chance to do this, and only play h3 should we be in definite danger of being back-rank mated?} O-O 10. Nc4 {Fritz gives this moves a question mark: I will be able to attack the knight with tempo.} Be6 {When playing with a fianchettoed king-side bishop, black often has the positional advantage if he can play d5 at some point with no repercussions. This was definitely the case in this game. Playing d5 now offers a lovely position for black in comparison with White’s. Unfortunately, I did not consider 10...d5!? at this stage.} 11. Ne3 Rb8 {Instead, Fritz suggests ...11. Qa5+, 12. Bd2, Qa4, which wins a pawn and also offers Black good chances on the queenside.} 12. h3 {See what I mean about these sorts of moves? What exactly does 12. h3 achieve? It would take a lot of wated effort on my part to get into a position where I can put my bishop on g4 so why bother defending it?} d5 {Finally.} 13. exd5 Nxd5 {I'm in love with this position. My king is safe, my knight is on a great square, and my pieces look dangerous against my opponent's queenside.} 14. Nxd5 {Surely a mistake. This offers my bishop a very powerful square and will lead to the loss of a pawn.} Bxd5 15. Qg3 Bxb2 16. Bxb2 Rxb2 17. c3 {If instead 17. Qc3, the right move is 17...Rxc2. After the Queen takes, the rook, Bxc2 ensures Black will recover at least the H-rook. If 18. Rd1, 18. Qb8 If 18. Rh2, Qa5+ with Qe5+ to follow. If 19. Qd1, Rd8+, 20.Kc1, Qe1+, and unless the Queen does not sacrifice herself immediately, 21. Kb2, Rb2+, 22.Qe6, with a forced Queen sac and mate to follow. } Bxg2 {I was rather chuffed that I spotted this in a blitz game.} 18. Qxg2 Qd2+ 19. Kf1 Qd3+ 20. Ke1 {Necessary, otherwise the king can slip to safety to g2 once his Queen has moved.} Qxc3+ 21. Kf1 Qd3+ 22. Ke1 {Not strictly necessary but when in INCREMENTAL blitz games, it never hurts to get more time, especially when one can take a pawn in doing so.} Rfb8 {22 Rfb8 pretty much does the job, but there’s actually a rather nifty mate in 8!: 22. Rd8!!, 23. Qg5, Rd1+, 24. Rxb1, Qxb1+, 25. Qc1, Qxc1+, 26. Ke2, Qd1+, 27. Ke3, Qd3+, 28. Kf4, Rd4+, 29. Kg5, f6+, 30. Kh6, Rh4++} 23. Rd1 Rb2b1 24. Qf3 {If 24. Qg4, I most probably would have played 24...Rxd1+, 25. Qxd1, Rb1. However, another move is better because it forces mate in 7. Can you spot it and the mate?} Qxf3 25. Nxf3 Rxd1+ 26. Kxd1 Rb1+ 27. Ke2 Rxh1 {27. It’s over, my opponent recognises this, and resigns.}
