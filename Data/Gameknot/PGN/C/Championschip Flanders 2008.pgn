[Opening "Four knights (C46), Italian variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {A four-knights game, I hate this! It's not agressive enough...} Nf6 4. Bc4 {An Italian way of it, Bb5 is also possible, but then you have a Spanish variation of the FKG.} Bc5 5. d3 d6 6. Bg5 {The first really active move, it's a normal one, but Nd5 is threatening...} Na5 7. Qd2 {People normally play Bb3, but this is not a bad one, he receives the semi-open d-file.} Nxc4 8. dxc4 c6 {because Nd5 was still threatening...} 9. Bxf6 {An odd move, you don't give your best piece for a stupid night!} Qxf6 10. O-O-O {If he would play Qg5, I can exange and I have the pair of the bishops, and I win the f2-pawn.} Be6 {A strong and active move.} 11. Qe2 Rd8 {Defending my weakest link, the d-pawn.} 12. Kb1 {I'll never understand this move. He didn't play to win.} O-O 13. Na4 {Trying to exange the night for the bishop.} Bb4 14. a3 Ba5 15. c5 {It seems to be a good move, but if look good, you see the weaknesses he gives to white. For example: my bishop on e6 has a huge power! He became a killing spree! He will also deliver me of my weakness on d6.} Bc7 16. Rd2 {Want to double the rooks.} Qe7 17. Rhd1 b5 {This is a good move, I obligate him to take on e6!} 18. cxd6 Bxd6 {Now my both bishops are killing sprees.} 19. Nc3 Rd7 {Want to go to the b-file with my rook.} 20. Qe3 h6 {Don't want to exange the bishop for that night, so h6 is in this case an acceptable move.} 21. Rd2d3 {Want to go with the queen to d2, but I win a tempo.} Bc4 22. Rd3d2 Rb8 {Yes! He's on the b-file!} 23. g4 b4 {Strong move.} 24. axb4 Rxb4 25. g5 {Who will be the first to have a really strong attack?} Rxb2+ {It will be me, this is a powerfull move who kills my poor opponent...} 26. Ka1 {after 26. Kxb2 Ba3  27. Ka1 Bb2 !! 28. Kxb2 Qb4  he also doesn't have any chance...} Bb8 {An important move, all the rest loses! (because there will be Rxd6!)} 27. Nd5 Ra2+ 28. Kb1 Rb7+ 29. Qb3 Qa3 {And now he gave up! I hope you have enjoyed this game!}
