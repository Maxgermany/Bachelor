1. e4 {I challenged bobdoleeatsfood in this game who I had previously lost 2 times too. I have been playing chess for a almost a 1 year and 4 months, and I feel playing people who know the game of chess is the only way to improve upon my play. King pawn opening for me. Feel free to comment, and let me know if I make a mistake with my annotation or bad moves in my game play. } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Giuoco Piano straight out of the book. } 4. d3 Nf6 5. Bd2 {Bg5 is the text book move, but I wanted to develope my bishop to where I could use it to attack either side of the board. I am fairly new to this sport, so I do not know if this is a strong move. } O-O 6. Nc3 d6 7. Qe2 {I plan to push my g and h pawns to his king. I will be ready to attack after O-O-O.} Bg4 8. h3 {I feel black Bg4 is a wasted tempo move, but I'm sure he has motive for this I just do not see what it is.  } Be6 9. Bxe6 {I have to trade this piece I had no place to put my bishop. If 9.Bb5, a7, 10.Bxc6 where black would follow with with bxc6 opening the b file for an attack on my queen side which would be bad for a O-O-O. I think I annotated all of those moves right. } fxe6 {cxe6 weakens the pawn protection for his king but also opens the f file for rook. } 10. O-O-O Qd7 11. g4 {Now I will start to push my pawns. } Rfb8 12. Rdg1 b5 {Just as I expected with my O-O-O. } 13. h4 a5 14. g5 Ne8 15. h5 a4 16. Qf1 {This may not have been the best move, but I need someplace to put my knight when black plays b4. I am starting to feel the pressure of blacks attack and definitely feel he has the upper hand and I am now in defense mode.} b4 17. Ne2 b3 18. a3 bxc2 19. Kxc2 Rb3 20. Bc3 {My only defense for what is to come with a both rooks on the b file. Now I know he will start to push his pawns on the d and e files. } d5 21. exd5 exd5 {I thought he would have taken this with his queen. I like this better I can start to see where I might be able to work an attack now. I think the queen would have been crippling on d5 challenging my knight on f3.} 22. Nxe5 {I have to break up these pawns before they challenge my bishop on c3.} Nxe5 23. Bxe5 Bd6 24. Bc3 Qc6 25. Nd4 {Got him, I am starting to feel the pressure relieve I know we will exchange some pieces here, but I intend on removing the pressure on my king. } Rxc3+ {I did not expect this move. I can see the light now. After 26.bxc3 I will start my attack. } 26. bxc3 Qb6 27. Qg2 Bxa3 {Exactly as I expected. I am not real threatened by this though. He will be able to put me in check a few times and eat up a pawn or two if he wants, but I clearly have the advantage. I think???} 28. Qxd5+ Kh8 {I don't know if he did not see this or did not think it to be very threatening, but now 29.Qxa8 and locking down the knight. } 29. Qxa8 {Black resigned at this point. I know black will comment on this game, and I would like to see what he says. Perspectives are always different and I do not have that much experience. So I might not have seen the potential combination that he was setting up. I know I got the win though, and I feel it was against a better player that I. }
