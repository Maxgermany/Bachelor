[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Charlick (Englund) gambit"]

1. d4 e5 {Horrible move. I just played mechanically, without really thinking. I realized what I did just a second too late. } 2. e3 {Even worse. At least, it doesn't take advantage of my mistake. } exd4 3. exd4 d5 {Symmetry.} 4. Be3 {Very passive.} Bf5 {Daring a little more.} 5. Qe2 {Interesting, trying to check by moving the bishop, but still "naive". Black can defend.} Bb4+ {Just to make him move the pawn. } 6. c3 {Which he does (better was to shield the king with the knight atd2, and then kick the bishop - to favour developement). I could have exchanged Bf5xNb1, trying to force this move, but it was not a good idea to lose the two bishop's force so soon... unless the queen could have gonte to a5. } Be7 {Shielding the discovered check, and now this is a good square for the bishop. White, instead, is a little cramped. } 7. Nf3 {Here, I really wanted to play in order to preserve my lsb against Nh4. } h6 {The only safe way was that. I have no hurry to play my Nb8, until I see where the game is going. The text has also the advantage of guard g5. I've had a look on Qd2, and if Nh4, Bg5, but c3, then Bh5, g4, Bg6... and NxB. I don't say this is a loser line for black, but I just wanted to keep my lsb on the long diagonal. But in doing this...} 8. Qb5+ {...I overlooked this move, and that forced me to try to play "as if I had a plan". The only possible plan here is to play the counter attack, wildly, and let the queen go grabbing pawns. } Nd7 9. Qxb7 {May better was Qxd5. Anyway, this move will cost white a lot in developement, thanks to the queen's chase that will follow. } Rb8 {Ok, let's see where it leads. I wouldn't have gone for this because I don't see any inmediate attack on white's position. The resulting (after Rxb2) attack on the knight is hardly a compensation.} 10. Qxd5 {...specially when the bishop is attacked. But now, the "chase the queen" plan can start. } Be6 11. Qa5 Rxb2 {I don't have any double threat on the knight, so white has time to go grabbing pawns. } 12. Qxa7 {But I am undeveloped for a proper attack. } Bf5 {I can now have my bishop on his old "threat the knight" plan (having the WQ diverted from her good position).} 13. Nbd2 Rc2 {A bad move, since it allows Bb5. But I had to go for some compensation. If I don't create attack and freedom for my pieces, my developement would be sterile. Still better for white to develop with Bb5, followed by Ne5. Instead, Rb1 invites to RxN, NxN, BxRb1, NxB, and another game begins. Anyway, I'm not interested in simplifications. Of course, here white can defend the pawn with Qa5, attacking again my lsb... and so on. } 14. Nb3 {Maybe looking at b7. Still better was Bb5. } Rxc3 15. Ne5 {Ok, I've sacrified two developement moves and conceded the semiopen b column... for some reason, right? So...} Bb4 {...now that Nc6 is impossible for white!} 16. Bd2 {And this suggested me an interesting idea. } Rxb3 17. axb3 {BxB loses to RxB. } Bxd2+ {The king is forced to go into a pin! I would like to say I've seen it from the beginning, but sadly it wasn't true (it was a blitz). } 18. Kxd2 Nxe5 {I won a piece, but white has tree pawns to compensate, and my pieces are now far less developed than his. } 19. Bb5+ {c6 was possible, but I looked for another combination. } Bd7 {...but it was a mistake. Nd7 was far safer. If white takes the knight, he loses the bishop. Qa8+, pinning the knight g8 to the rook, is a double-edged weapon for white to play with. } 20. Bxd7+ Qxd7 21. Qb8+ {Yes, take your queen away from the action... } Ke7 22. Qb4+ {...but let's see if I will be able to survive the attack white is building. Re1 was a sure bet to recover the piece, in a funny and unusual position, with two opposite pieces pinned to the open and centralized kings. You won't see this easily in a serious game. :-)} Kf6 {I have to put my K in a square that my pieces can cover while developing... if I don't get checkmated during the escape! I expected here Ra6+, c6, R1-a1, putting me in further troubles, but white...} 23. Rae1 {Too late. The other rook would have been better, holding the possibility of Ra8. } Nc6 24. Qc5 {Qf8 was bad, but very funny. Here, Nxe4 was enough to have an edge, but I just was a little scared of a mate combination (my king is awfully exposed), and I went for...} Qd6 {I have an exchange, and the two kingts, once activated, will be able to stop the b pawn. } 25. Qc3 {Good idea from white, but still Qxe4+ saved the day, entering in an endgame. } Qf4+ {Just a shot in the dark. Qe3 and the situation is the same. White would be half-trapped, but so am I, and except for the d pawn, I can't see anything more. } 26. Ke2 {Trying to shield his king behind the pawns (the psycological effect on white). He will pay for it... a trapped rook! I need two moves to activate the other rook. Too much time!} Nxd4+ {The worst moment for taking the pawn, and with the worst piece. } 27. Kf1 Kg6 {This leaves the e column to black, but it is needed to unpin the knight. And I want to play Nf6 for the last "a lot of" moves! :-) Of  course, I knew that after Re8 white would have pinned me again. I planned then Kh7, defending the rook, and shield with the g pawn in case of a queen's check. The game is still interesting, but white...} 28. Qxc7 {A blunder that deprives the game of any further interest... a pity. } Qxc7 {}
