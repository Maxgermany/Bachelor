1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Bg4 {I don't like this move as it helps my development.} 3. h3 Bf5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. e3 Nb4 {I think the computer is out of its opening book since this is not standard development as I can defend the pawn with my knight or bishop.} 6. Bb5+ c6 7. Ba4 e6 {I was afraid he would play 7. ... Qa5 as 8. c3 Nd3+} 8. a3 Na6 {At this point I like my position as I have a lead in development and better piece placement.} 9. Nbd2 Nf6 10. O-O Be7 11. c4 {Trying to catch his king in the center although he can easily castle. However, he had a wiseguy move.} Bd3 {!? This is a strong move. I do not think his moves from here are solid though.} 12. cxd5 Bxf1 13. dxc6 b5 14. Qxf1 bxa4 15. Qxa6 {Material is even (I did not count. This is a blitz game I just felt like I had good chances at this point.} O-O 16. c7 Qe8 17. Rc1 Nd5 18. Bh2 {Planting his knight on d5 was a strong move. I was not sure how to respond and just retreated my bishop.} Nb6 {His knight is stronger on d5 in my opinion. My passed pawn is dangerous but at least he can sacrifice it for the pawn if needed.} 19. Nc4 Qd7 20. Nce5 {Maneuvering my knight in.} Qd5 21. Nc6 Bf6 22. Nb8 {Separating the rooks. I like how strong this move is as it forces him to be passive and is not so narrow minded to only focus on promoting the pawn. Plus I get this strange feeling whenever I trap rooks in the queenside of Kasparov's game against Deep Blue.} Rc8 23. Rc5 Qa2 {Threatening 24. ... Qa1+/Qb1+ 25. Qf1 Qxf1+ 26. Kxf1 and my attack will be difficult.} 24. g4 Be7 25. Rc6 {I like this move as it targets his knight and he has no good defenses.} Qa1+ 26. Kg2 Bf8 {Black is lost at this point in my opinion.} 27. Rxb6 Re8 28. Rc6 Qa2 29. Qb7 {This move I am uncertain about. I can take the rook and still have my pawn on the 7th rank or I can advance the pawn and gain a rook for a pawn.} Qd5 30. Qxa8 {I think at this point the computer realizes he is lost and has no saving strategy so he is only attempting various plans to see if I'll make a mistake.} e5 31. Bxe5 f6 32. Bg3 f5 33. gxf5 Qxf5 {?! To me his pin on my queen is worth a pawn. Maybe not though! } 34. Qb7 Qc8 35. Qb5 {I was looking for a quick win. Trading queen still wins but a quick win would be cool too. Keep in mind this is quick time control.} a6 36. Qd5+ Kh8 {Looking for a checkmate. Looking for a checkmate. I was waiting for my prof to show up on the day before Thanksgiving while playing this game. } 37. Ne5 {Threatening to land my Queen on g8.} h6 38. Nf7+ Kh7 39. Nd7 Bxa3 {I must have a forced mate at this point since computers sometimes will blunder if any move loses to try to survive a couple more moves.} 40. Qf5+ Kg8 {I dilly-dallied at this point. Rxh6 is correct. So I basically wasted like 5 moves. I fail at life :P} 41. Nf6+ Kf8 42. Nd7+ Kg8 43. Nxh6+ Kh8 44. Nf7+ Kg8 45. Rh6 Qa8+ 46. Kh2 Qg2+ 47. Kxg2 gxh6 48. Qg6# {Good game! Maybe someday hard will not defeat me. Perhaps I will need to play slower. The moral of this is computers are not invincible, they just have an easier time not making mistakes.}
