1. d4 e6 2. e3 c5 {I've been experimenting with the Franco-Benoni.  In this game my opponent plays a stonewall-type setup and goes for the direct Kingside attack.} 3. c3 Nf6 4. Bd3 d5 5. Nd2 Nc6 6. f4 {In practice, the Stonewall formation is surprisingly resilient and difficult to deal with.} Be7 7. Ngf3 O-O 8. O-O b6 9. Ne5 Bb7 10. Rf3 cxd4 11. exd4 Nxe5 12. fxe5 Ne4 13. Rh3 {Here comes the Kingside attack.  I will defuse it as best I can.} f5 14. Qh5 h6 15. Bxe4 fxe4 16. Rg3 Bg5 17. Nf1 Rf5 18. Qg6 Qe8 {White now has to exchange off some of the attacking pieces.} 19. Qxe8+ Rxe8 20. Bxg5 Rxg5 21. Rxg5 hxg5 {Black is left with a slightly impaired pawn structure, but also a passed e4 pawn that should be useful later.} 22. Ne3 Rf8 23. Rf1 Rxf1+ {Not sure if this was best, but I thought it would be ok as White's N does not have a lot of good squares.} 24. Kxf1 Ba6+ 25. Ke1 Kf7 26. Nc2 Kg6 27. g4 {White prevents entry by the King.} Kf7 28. Nb4 Bb7 {To protect c6.} 29. Kd2 Ke7 30. b3 a5 31. Nc2 b5 32. c4 bxc4 33. bxc4 dxc4 {Black's pawn structure is further fractured, but now is a pawn to the good.} 34. Kc3 Bd5 35. Ne3 Kd7 36. Nxc4 Bxc4 37. Kxc4 a4 {White's K cannot stray out of the square of the e4 pawn, so this pawn can't be touched.  White's K also can't come to the 5th rank.} 38. Kc3 Kc6 39. Kc4 a3 40. Kb4 Kd5 {Now Black's K can penetrate.} 41. Kc3 e3 {The e pawn can be used as a decoy to win the other pawns and improve the K's position.} 42. Kd3 e2 43. Kxe2 Kxd4 44. Kd2 {Black will get another passed pawn--and the King is threatening all the white Kingside pawns.} Kxe5 45. Ke3 Kd5 46. Kd3 e5 47. Ke3 e4 48. Ke2 Kd4 49. Kd2 e3+ 50. Ke1 Kd3 51. Kd1 e2+ 52. Ke1 Ke3 {After the pawn marches forward and pins the White King to the back rank, only pawn moves are available.} 53. h4 gxh4 {Now Black has another passer--and White still has to move pawns.} 54. g5 Kf3 {This move is crucial to avoid stalemate.  Once White is out of pawn moves, Kd2 is forced.  After White's Kf2, the e pawn can promote.} 55. g6 h3 {Or the h pawn can promote.  White resigned here after putting up a very good fight.}
