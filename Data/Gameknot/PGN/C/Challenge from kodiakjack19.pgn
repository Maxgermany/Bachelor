[Opening "QGD (D06), Marshall defence"]

1. d4 {After our first foray into direct competition, Jeff declared right off the bat that he would not annotate this game.  My reply was, "I will then--the story must be told!"  Here, then, is the telling of the tale...  Like our first game, I began with the Queen's pawn opening...} d5 {Jeff answered in kind.} 2. c4 {I, once again, offer my Queen's bishop pawn as fodder for his attack in hope of gaining the classic double center pawn positional advantage.  Queen's Gambit, by name, and (if accepted) offers white a strong advantage in the opening game.} Nf6 {Ahh, the Marshall Defense...  So named for Matt Dillon's classic gunfighter's attitude--stand in the middle of the street and dare all would-be legend killers to "bring it on!"  (Ok, I watch too much TV & study too little chess to be able to accurately relate the origin of the name, but I was suitably determined to test my metal nonetheless.)} 3. Nf3 {Always a fan of symmetry--I allow my horse out of the stable in reply.  Not the most aggressive response & will cost me considerable momentum.} Nc6 {Bringing his entire mounted posse to bear, Jeff brings forth his other Knight.} 4. cxd5 {I think I was trying to tempt his Queen out early to give me a target at which to start taking potshots, but I don't really recall.  I really didn't want to echo his double Knight approach & wanted to gain back a little control & dictate the attack.  I admit to being more than a little of a control freak when it comes to playing white--sometimes taking an unorthodox approach just to keep my counterpart on his toes.  I also know that Jeff scouts incredibly well & I don't remember ever giving up on a gambit this early.} Nxd5 {Undeterred (and obviously not taking my bait to expose his Queen--solid chess play, not an example of latent prudery) Jeff bravely brings his Knight over in the capture--exposing himself to attack.} 5. e4 {And attack I do.  Now I have the strong pawn structure I wanted with the original gambit.  Life is good.  I am happy.} Ndb4 {Pushing forward, resisting waste of effort by retreating, Jeff invades my territory.  He must pay for his temerity!} 6. d5 {I push the attack & invite him to do his worst!} Bg4 {What?!?  My friend, do you not see that I am attacking your knight?  Such a bold refusal to allow me to control the ebb and flow of attack and retreat.  I am perplexed, confused by his willingness to offer up his knight so early.  I am also jealous that I rarely exhibit such boldness myself.  I must do something unexpected--outrageous enough to make him sorry that he wasn't more traditional in his response.} 7. Bd3 {So, I make a move that confuses even me--let him figure this one out.  He offered his knight so willingly, so I decide I don't want it.} Bxf3 {The nerve!  My knight was just sitting there, protecting no one--attacking no one--and he just takes him out like he's nothing.  Jeff exhibits no concern for my knight's family--his wife and 8 small children--just kills him as he rests upon his mighty steed at the edge of the conflict.} 8. Qxf3 {Remember how I wanted to draw Jeff's queen into the fray prematurely?  Now, whose queen left the castle w/o time to even adjust her knickers?  In my desire to be unexpected I have allowed myself to be manipulated.  I'm sure that I will pay.} Ne5 {My fair lady is under attack.  (I myself always preferred "Pygmalion"--thinking that most stories flow more easily when you don't have to break out in song every 10 minutes, but that's my own opinion--and has nothing to do with this chess game, or any other for that matter)  I would have probably attacked from d4, but at this point, I'm respecting Jeff's game more than my own.  He has issued a forked attack on both my queen and bishop & I am forced to backpedal.  He's drawn my queen out early.  Offered his knight in an early sacrifice and confused me enough that I didn't even take the proffered piece.  And now he's wrested the momentum from me & is initiating the attack very well.    I must regroup.  This unprovoked attack in the form of a knight fork has made me seriously regret my revelation to Jeff of my secret fear of knights and their confusing move possibilities.} 9. Qe2 {Who am I kidding?  This move is a weak attempt to pretend that I can protect my bishop.  My cleric might as well give consume a dose of hemlock or pray for divine deliverance, cause my queen's obviously just there for show. } Nbxd3+ {Down a bishop & forced to move my King so that castling is not even a dream.  I've lost the momentum completely.  I have no attack plan in operation.  I am scrambling wildly in total disarray.  Did I really want this story to be told?  I don't think so.} 10. Kd2 {This will scare him.  I bet he's scared that I'll try to take his knight with my king.  Right.  I can see him shaking from here.  I wonder if he'll resign...} g6 {He certainly is hiding his fear well.  He opens a handy diagonal for his bishop while my mind bounces around like a crack addict in Disneyland wondering if I should try to score from Goofy or if Donald Duck is more likely to be holding.} 11. g3 {Hey, moving a pawn was good enough for Jeff, maybe it'll work for me too.  Secretly, I'm planning on attacking his knight at e5.  I hope he doesn't notice & has to leave his knight at d3 hanging.} Nxf2 {Damn!  If one of my pieces even thinks about attacking he gets killed.  Jeff isn't even concerned about trading his knight for my lowly pawn.  He has something up his sleeve--I just have no idea what it might be.} 12. Qxf2 {May as well take the knight this time--things certainly didn't work out when I passed up my last opportunity to take one of his knights out of the picture.  I still have the uneasy feeling that I'm going to regret this somehow.} Bh6+ {Not unexpected.  I'll bet he's hoping that my king will go to his home square & let him get me with his forking knight.  I'll show him} 13. Ke2 {Ha!  No forking way!} Bxc1 {Ow!  I have no spiritual guidance left for my kingdom.  I must forge ahead with purely a sectarian society.  At least this won't be one of those religious wars, since neither of us will soon have any Religious leaders.  I'm not a prophet--it's just a statement of fact once my rook exerts his will.} 14. Rxc1 {There.  That takes care of that.  My position is ugly, but I'm only a pawn behind & I don't have the distraction of spiritual guidance.  I'm feeling a little better.  I still have no plan of attack, but I've gotten rid of most of the imminent threats to my royal family & I'm ready to regroup.} h5 {The march of the pawns...  What to do, what to do?} 15. Nd2 {Let's get this knight up here & see if he make something happen.} O-O {Just to prove that he still can--Jeff castles.  Rubbing salt in my structurally defenseless wounds.  Exposed and planless, I must think of something. } 16. Qd4 {I think I'll attack the knight that started this decline in the first place.} f6 {That was a short-lived plan.} 17. Rcf1 {Well, moving my rook over here certainly looks like I'm up to something.  I just hope Jeff doesn't realize that all I'm thinking is, "I want my mommy!"} Qd7 {I think I'm temporarily out of semi-clever things to say.} 18. Rac1 {Yep, I'm dry here...} Qh3 {I'm getting used to having my land invaded by now.  I'm thinking about putting out a welcome mat.  I wonder if Jeff's queen is going to want to redecorate now that she's here?} 19. Qg1 {Nobody threatens one of my pawns & gets away with it!  A woman has to protect her minions!} Ng4 {I am really starting to hate that knight...} 20. Nf3 {My whole world is starting to revolve around this one pawn.  If I lose it, I'll lose everything.  Well, not really, but it seems that way at the moment.} Rad8 {You can't distract me like that.  That pawn's protected and you know it!} 21. Rxc7 {Now, that's how you make a dramatic move with a rook!  Take that you opposing pawns you!} Rfe8 22. Qh1 {You tell me.  I don't have a clue...  Looking back on it now, I think I should wipe out another pawn.} Rd6 {I guess Jeff's rooks want to come out and play.} 23. Ng1 {Now, that surprised even me!  I seem to have trapped his queen with a little razzmatazz tap dance down to the other side of the board with my rook alternating with a seemingly pointless move by my queen.  What's he gonna do now?  Trade queens?  I'm holding my breath here...} Qxh2+ {Looks like a queen trade is inevitable here.} 24. Qxh2 {Ooops, there it is!  Cat fight.  A little queen on queen action here.} Nxh2 {It's that pesky knight again.  I'm getting really tired of him poking his lance all up in my business.} 25. Rfc1 {Guess I'll double up my rooks & see what happens.} Ng4 {That's right you crazy horseman--you better get out of here.} 26. Rxb7 {Now, I'm killing pawns!} f5 {True to form, Jeff continues to play well--attacking, building a structured, well-orchestrated attack.} 27. Rxa7 {I take another pawn.} fxe4 {I guess it looks like fun, cause now Jeff's doing a little pawnacide of his own.} 28. Ra5 {Suddenly I realize that pawn's are pieces too--they shouldn't just be left hanging.  Let's protect these guys.} e6 {Fine.  Jeff's developed a taste for killing pawns.  I'm not going down quietly.   Arrrggghhhh!} 29. dxe6 {With a mighty war cry my pawn strikes out & slaughters the pawn that was attacking him.} Rexe6 {He's doubled up his rooks--all of his pieces are grouped together.  He looks poised for an attack.  I'm all over the place.  I'm going to take a moment & think this thing through.} 30. Ra7 {Pay no attention to this little rook all by himself over here...  I'm not planning anything, or anything.  Just going over here to catch my breath for a moment.  You go ahead with whatever your plan is.  Don't worry about me. } Re8 {Oh, poo!  He noticed me.  Now what do I do?} 31. Rcc7 {Double up my rooks, that's what.  The attacked becomes the attacker.  What'chu gonna do now, huh?} Nf6 {It's that same knight again!  Messing with my plan of attack.  I'm not sure I had much more than that one little attack in me.  That knight really is annoying me.  I swear the next time Jeff and I play, I'm taking out his knights right away.  I don't care what kind of position I have to give up.  Oh, well, back to this game.  What was I was doing?} 32. Rcg7+ {Oh, yeah...  Using my doubled up rooks to attack his king.  I remember now.} Kh8 {Nimbly avoiding my attack, Jeff sidesteps very well, protected by that cursed knight that he brought back into play.} 33. Nh3 {Hey, I have a knight!  Let's see if my knight can get into the action here.} Rd7 {Doesn't look like Jeff's going to give a chance to mount a serious attack here.  He's throwing that rook around--daring me to trade.} 34. Rgxd7 {I'll do anything to get rid of that knight at this point--especially since I'll end up considerably ahead at the end of this series.  Come & get me!} Nxd7 {Committed to the attack, Jeff has no real choice...} 35. Rxd7 {Yay!!!!  I killed his knight.  Who cares about the game at this point.  I finally got the knight that I should have taken back near the beginning & I'm content.  Even if everything falls apart from here--at least that knight is out of the picture.} Re5 {It's late in the game to come up with a knight advantage at this point, but Jeff has a lot of fight left in him.  He moves forward to regroup with his pawns.} 36. Nf4 {Hey look--I have a knight here!} g5 {Anxious to regain the advantage, Jeff attacks when he should have studied the board a bit more.} 37. Ng6+ {And I get my own deadly fork going.} Kg8 38. Nxe5 {Now, the final warrior from the other side has been vanquished, but I know Jeff too well to let up.  He will not quit until every chance at a victory or a stalemate has been exhausted.} h4 {There's really nothing more to talk about here.  If I don't make a mistake, then it's just a matter of moves.  Jeff played an excellent game--I felt like I was behind the whole time & outplayed.  I strung together a couple of good moves here and there, but was pushed around almost from the get go.  I don't like to spoil the ending here, but I didn't make any glaring mistakes & the  game came to its inevitable conclusion.  Thank you for reading my annotation--I had fun writing it & I hope no one's offended by anything in it.  It was just meant to be fun. Lanny 1/29/2009} 39. gxh4 gxh4 40.
