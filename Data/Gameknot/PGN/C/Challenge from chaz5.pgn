1. e4 {King's pawn. going to open with Sicilian.} c5 2. Bc4 {Again, book opening. Nc6.} Nc6 3. Nf3 {Reply with e5. Stops Knight advance to g5 and continues development.} e5 4. a3 {He is stopping my advance of the knight. Nf6...Nc3/d3? Respond with d6.} Nf6 {If he advances Ng5, reply with d5 to stop attack.} 5. Ng5 {Called it.} d5 6. exd5 Nxd5 {If white takes, Qxg5, that way I force him to castle early and I control the center of the board.} 7. Qf3 {Many different ways this game could go. Pressure on the f7 pawn mate. Double pressure on the Nd5 so the best move is Qxg5. White will respond with Qxd5. In turn, I respond with Be6 becuase he won't take with his Queen.} Qxg5 8. Bxd5 {Pressure is still on f7 pawn. Didnt take with Queen but probably better move on his part. Bxc6...b7xc6, Qxc6+ and Rook is dead.} Qf6 9. Bxc6+ Qxc6 10. Qxc6+ bxc6 11. O-O {Castle means he wants to play Re1 to try to take the pawn advantage. Also, watch for d3 to develop his queen side pieces.} Bf5 12. d3 Bd6 {open up the castle opportunity, as well as protect the king's pawn from rook} 13. Nd2 {Pickle, Nc4 can be thwarted with Be6, however, if I move there, he brings his knight to e4.} O-O 14. b3 {c4? Bb2 and Re1 to add pressure? We will see.} Rfe8 15. f3 a5 16. Re1 {f4? Nc4? I will move e4. I lose a pawn but I feel that I will gain advantage in the long run. d3xe4...Be5, Rook is forced to move. Unless he captures with knight, though he said he doesnt want ot develop it just yet so we will see.} e4 17. dxe4 {On the money. Be5 to threaten the back ranks.} Be5 18. Rb1 Bc3 {put pressure on his beloved knight. also, not allowing him to take my bishop unless he wants to sac rook.} 19. g4 {e4 still cannot take bishop. I am going to move Queen's rook to d8 to force out his knight } Rad8 20. gxf5 Bxd2 21. Bxd2 Rxd2 22. Rbc1 f6 23. Re3 Re5 24. c4 {This may be risky, but I plan to move g6. Hopefully, he takes the bait, then I reply with Rg5+ and I can gain a lot of ground with both rooks on his side of the board.} g6 25. fxg6 Rg5+ 26. Kf1 {Rxh2 which puts pressure on the king to move otherwise rook is dead. I can see g6xh7 and then a move.} Rxh2 27. f4 Rxg6 28. Rcc3 Rhg2 29. Ref3 Rg2g1+ 30. Ke2 Rg6g2+ 31. Rf2 {I have a serious disadvantage in the pawn game (even if we have the same number of pawns). Rg3 is the best move I can see because if he takes, then I open up his back ranks to attack. Of course Rf3 is a most wise move.} Rg2g3 32. Rxg3+ Rxg3 33. Rf3 {Check the king, and force my rook to b2 to start taking out his pawns.}
