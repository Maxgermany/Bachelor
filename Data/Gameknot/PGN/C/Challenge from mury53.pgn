1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 {I've been experimenting with the King's Indian Attack as an opening for White.  I wasn't very happy with the position I got in this game.} c5 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. d4 Bg4 5. c3 e6 6. O-O Nf6 7. Bf4 {I don't like this position at all.  I should have gotten e4 in early.  Now Black has a much better center.} Qb6 8. b3 Bxf3 9. dxc5 Bxe2 10. Qxe2 Qxc5 {Now I'm down a pawn.} 11. Be3 Qd6 12. Nd2 {My center is worse, but I have a slight lead in development.  I will have to try to use it to get the material back eventually.} Be7 13. Rfd1 a6 {I'm not sure of the value of this move.} 14. Nc4 {dxc4 is not possible because the pawn is pinned to the Queen.  I'm hoping to use attacks on the Queen to gain some tempos to improve my position.} Qc7 15. Bf4 e5 {e5 is attacked three times, but only defended twice.} 16. Nxe5 Nxe5 17. Bxe5 Qb6 {The pawn has been regained.  And now my slight lead in development is making his King uncomfortable.} 18. Bxf6 Qxf6 19. Bxd5 Rb8 {Now White is a pawn up.} 20. Rde1 {This prevents castling immediately, as White can play Qxe7, winning a piece.} Kf8 21. Qe5 {With Black now unable to castle, I exchange down to an endgame.} Qxe5 22. Rxe5 Bf6 23. Re3 g6 24. Rae1 Kg7 25. c4 b6 26. Kg2 Rhd8 27. Re1e2 b5 28. h3 bxc4 29. bxc4 {Although I could be wrong about this, I thought this was the right recapture because it gives me the passed pawn.  I thought that would create more pressure for my opponent than playing Bxc4.} Rb6 30. Ra3 Kf8 31. Rf3 a5 32. Ra3 {This was not much of a plan on my part.  f7 is a target, but I haven't figured out how to get to it yet.} Ra6 33. Rb3 Rd7 34. Rb8+ Rd8 35. Rb7 {Now f7 will fall.} Rxd5 36. cxd5 {Out of desperation, my opponent gives up the exchange.  Now I have to figure out a plan to exert pressure with the two Rooks and the passed pawn.} Rd6 37. Rb5 Bd8 38. Rc2 h5 39. Rc6 Rd7 40. d6 {The passed pawn on the sixth rank becomes a monster.  Black has to spend all of his time dealing with it.} f5 41. Re5 {This Rook seals the King away from helping in the fight against the passed pawn.} Kf7 42. f4 {My Rook is now supported.} Kf8 43. Rb5 Kf7 44. h4 Ke6 45. Re5+ Kf7 {My opponent's King can't join the fight--but mine can.} 46. Kf3 Kf6 47. Ke3 Kf7 48. Kd3 Kf8 49. Kc4 Kf7 50. Kd5 Rb7 {Black is desperate.  Now that my King seals off his King, I could bring my second Rook into the fight.} 51. Rc8 {Hitting the hanging piece, which has no good squares.  Bf6 can be met with Rc7+.} Rb5+ 52. Kc6 {Now I'm hitting two hanging pieces.  Rxe5 is met with fxe5.} Rb6+ 53. Kc5 {Now Black has two pieces attacked and can only protect one.  Black resigned.}
