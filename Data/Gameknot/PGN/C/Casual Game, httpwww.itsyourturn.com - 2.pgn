1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 {Now White can play 4. c3 with an equal game. } 4. c4 {For reasons we shall soon see makes it easier for black to undermine White's center. } cxd4 5. Qxd4 Nc6 {Black already has a strong advantage.  White should play 6. Qf4. } 6. Qd2 {This is a tactical error.} Bb4 7. Nc3 {What is the correct continuation for black? } Nxe5 {This is a blunder.  The correct continuation is 7. ... d4  8. a3 Ba5!  9. b4 dxc3 threatening the queen, and now 10. Qxd8+ can be met by Bxd8 getting the bishop out of danger.  Playing 7. ... Ba5 first is the same thing because the pin isn't going anywhere. } 8. Be2 {This is also a blunder, since playing 8. a3 saves white from 8. ... d4. } d4 9. Nf3 dxc3 {9. ...

Bg5 (intending Bd2) where white can't avoid losing the exchange.} 24. Ref1 { } Rxe2 {Now 25. Rxf4 Bg5 26. Rxf5 Bxc1 27. h4 and white takes longer to die. } 25. h3 Be4 26. Rce1 Rxg2+ 27. Kh1 Rdd2 {}
