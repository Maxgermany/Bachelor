1. e4 {Typical. This is the only move I do, which may be inflexible, but 'Best by Test'.} d6 {What opening is this?} 2. d4 {Typical.} Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Bb5 {Was this OK?} Bd7 5. Bxc6 Bxc6 {Was my capture OK?} 6. d5 {Threatened.} Bd7 7. Nf3 e5 8. O-O {I am ahead in development.} Qe7 {I don't think he should have brought his queen out so early.} 9. Be3 {Thinking he would castle.} c5 {Drastically weakens queenside.} 10. Bg5 {Pin.} Bg4 {Pin on me.} 11. h3 {OK?} Bxf3 12. Qxf3 {gxf3 would have been bad, as it would expose my king.} Qc7 {Why would he do this?} 13. Bxf6 {Now black must get doubled pawns.} gxf6 14. Qxf6 {Bringing my queen into play. Would bringing it out in this situation usually be bad?} Rg8 15. Nb5 {Chasing the queen.} Be7 {?? I can see why black wanted to do this, but he won't get to kill my queen, as I will check him.} 16. Nxc7+ Kd7 17. Qxf7 {He resigned here.}
