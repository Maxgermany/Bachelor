[Opening "Dutch defence, Rubinstein variation (A84)"]

1. d4 {As always, my standard.} f5 {Oh no......another Dutch player. As I really hate playing against the Dutch, I decide to try to get black out of his book as quickly as possible. Once I play 2.c4 to gain space and clear a square for my Nb1, I have every intention of avoiding main lines.} 2. c4 e6 {Interesting. I usually run across Dutch players who follow the Leningrad Variation (1.d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7). 2...e6 is one of variants of another main line (whose name escapes me) which is 1.d4 f5 2.c4 Nf6 3.g3 e6 4.Bg2 (with altered move order). Black is obviously fluent in this opening, so I made the decision to attempt to throw him off starting on my 4th move. My intent is to develop my queen's knight and get my dark squared bishop to g5 in an attempt to start a pre-emptive attack. The problem with that idea is that I plan on totally disregarding the concept of getting my light squared bishop on it's natural long diagonal. My personal preference is that IF I'm going to fianchetto a bishop, it is going to be aiming AT the enemy king, not away from it. That is the main reason for my distaste of playing against the Dutch. I'm sure I'll pay for admitting that:)} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {Black sticks with his plan by developing and preparing to castle.} 4. Bg5 {?! Probably not the most sound move, but as I said my intent was to get out of what was surely my opponent's preferred line.} Bb4 {I would give black the slight edge here. He has developed nicely and is prepared to castle. His pin of my knight and kingside space make up for the "weakness" of what I assume will be his castled position.} 5. Qc2 {An interesting idea. This move was made for three reasons - 1) my fear of having doubled pawns on the c file after Bb4xNc3 2) to have the ability to castle long (and QUICK if needed) and 3) my queen is now aimed at the side black will probably castle on and will be the anchor of my queenside expansion.} O-O {Black has now secured his king and is ready for typical Dutch style development on the queenside.} 6. a3 {?! Another somewhat dubious move. As the threat against his bishop must be dealt with, black must decide between three different options A) trade his bishop for my knight B) retreat the bishop to a5 (which is horrible because of 7.b4 Bb6 8.c5) or C) retreat the bishop back to e7 to interpose the pin.} Be7 {Black chooses wisely. However, white now gains a little time to get developed.} 7. e3 d6 {At the time I considered this play to be a little slow. Upon analysis though, black now has the real threat of playing a very strong c5!} 8. Be2 {? A very slow play on my part. My Ng1 is now a potential problem.} e5 {! Black takes advantage of my passive play and takes the first swing of the match.} 9. Bxf6 {The way I saw it, since my hopes of controlling the light squares was my only real chance of having ANY play, I decided to remove his knight since it controlled both d5 and e4.} Bxf6 10. d5 {Trying to close up the position while restricting black's Nb8.} Bd7 {?! Black makes a slow play of his own. I expected Nd7.} 11. e4 {Hoping he takes so I can retake with 12.Nxe4 (threatening his Bf6)} fxe4 12. Nxe4 Bf5 {! Oops, I didn't anticipate this. This pin on my queen must be dealt with.} 13. Bd3 {! No problem. My light squared bishop gets a chance to make up for his earlier slow play by getting to where he should have been in the first place, and interposes the pin.} g6 {? I'm not quite sure what was intended by this move. Black has weakened his kingside further, for reasons unknown to me.} 14. Ne2 {White's "problem" knight finally gets developed.} Nd7 15. O-O-O {?! Risky, risky....... Black has a lot of ammo poised to fire at white's castled position. My idea was to get as much ammo of my own over to black's castled position. We are both very weak defensively now.} Bg5+ {Hoping white responds 16.Nxg5, so 16...QxN  can be played next.} 16. Kb1 {Simple evasion......no real harm done.} Bxe4 {! Black is eying white's f pawn.} 17. Bxe4 Rxf2 {! While I saw the f pawn falling, I didn't really consider the implications of this new pin against my queen. As it is safe for the moment, better protect my g pawn.} 18. g3 Nf6 {? Black makes his first real error of the game. I see a way to remove his g and h pawns and to bring all of my forces to bear on his decimated kingside before he can get over to defend.} 19. Bxg6 {! Here it comes!} hxg6 20. Qxg6+ Kh8 21. Qxg5 Rxe2 {? Black's desire to maintain his material advantage will cost him dearly. White now owns the f file, and it's possession is vital to the attack that follows.} 22. Rdf1 {! Here comes part two of the mating attack.} Nh7 {? 22...Ne4 was the last chance to save the game for black.} 23. Qh5 {! Pinning the knight against the king and hitting the Re2. White would have lost the game for sure if 23.QxQ were played, as black's material advantage would have been impossible to overcome.} Rg2 {Saving the rook, but allowing.............} 24. Rf7 {! White threatens mate in 1.} Qg8 {The ONLY possible play.} 25. Rhf1 {White now loads the other barrel.} b5 {Good idea. Black hopes to distract white by play on the queenside. If white takes the bait, black will play Rb8 and have a strong attack b2, threatening mate himself.} 26. Rxc7 {I had calculated the danger of getting involved in pawn exchanges on the b and c files, so I simply make room for my Rf1 to move to f7. The grabbing of black's c pawn was inconsequential, but satisfying all the same.} Rd8 {Black really has no good move to make in this position.} 27. Rff7 {! Mate is imminent.} Rg1+ {A lat gasp check that is easily evaded.} 28. Ka2 {And black resigned due to 28...any 29.RxN  QxR 30.QxQ  . I felt it was a well played game by both sides, and worthy of posting. Also, I felt it was time to post another of my own games! I've gotten a little caught up in annotating some famous GM games, and wanted to comment on what I KNEW one side was thinking, not just what I THOUGHT someone else was thinking;) Thanks to my opponent for the good game, and thanks to all who have messaged me with the kind words about other games. I'll try to keep them coming:) - Thomas}
