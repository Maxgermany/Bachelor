1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {I have a sense of deja vu. We played this same opening a few weeks ago.} exd4 {But now it's very different.} 4. Qxd4 {I took me a long time thinking about this move.  My obvious concern is that my queen will spend the next few turns being chased around the board while Aleks develops his pieces.  There are some games in the database that play this move so I figured why not, it looks like fun :)} Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Bf4 {Completed development} Be7 9. O-O-O {Rook lines up the d file. My a2 pawn is a weak point that I'll have to keep an eye on.} O-O 10. h4 {I'm starting to form a plan of attack... some combination of Qd3, Ng5, e5 and Qh7#. It's pretty obvious though, so lets see what Aleks does about it. I'm expecting him to play Ng4 at some point which would threaten to fork my rooks as well as my queen if she is on d3. Hopefully if I play Rd2 it will be sufficient to prevent it.} Qd7 11. Qd3 Ng4 {As expected. I'll defend the f2 square with Rd2. Him moving the knight has opened up my queen's access to h7, for now.} 12. Rd2 a5 13. Ng5 Bxg5 14. hxg5 g6 15. Qh3 h5 16. gxh6 e.p. Kh7 {The king is pretty solid there. I need a new plan.} 17. Qg3 Rae8 18. f3 Nf6 {A better move for him was Ne5. It might have led to a lot of trading out, where I end up at +2 pawns. (Bxe5 Rxe5. Qxe5 dxe5. Rxd7 Bxd7. Nd5 f6. Xc7)} 19. e5 {The only place his knight can safely go is Ng8. Nh5 = Rxh5. gxh5 Qg7#. (I'm hoping he doesn't see this one) Nd5 = Rxd5 Bxd5. Nxd5 and threatening a royal fork. Ne4, Ng4 = death by pawn.} Nh5 20. Rxh5 Rfg8 21. Rh1 d5 22. Ne4 {The d5 pawn is pinned to his queen. He has to defend against the mother of all forks when I play Nf6. He could continue with Re6 and eventually give up that rook, but at this point Aleks sees the writing on the wall and resigns.}
