1. e4 c5 2. f4 d6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e5 dxe5 5. fxe5 Nd5 6. Bc4 Nb6 {a bit of uncautious play from Black, in this Sicilian: the Knight is using too much tempo...} 7. Qe2 {nothing fancy: just supporting Nxb4, Qxb4, with a prolonging attack on f7, forcing e6...} g6 8. b3 Bg7 9. Bb2 O-O 10. O-O {all natural development, so far...} Bg4 {trying to undermine the position of pawn e5: take out a defender; but after Bxf3, Qxf3, pawn b7 becomes a target...} 11. Nc3 {which is why White can safely develop...} Nb8d7 {a strange move, also attacking e5: after just e5-e6, Black is already in trouble...} 12. h3 {time to demand a declaration from Bg4...} Be6 {Black has little to hope for after Bxf3, Qxf3, Nxe5, Qxb7: but this is just plain loss of tempo...} 13. Bxe6 fxe6 14. Ng5 Nxe5 15. Rxf8+ Qxf8 16. Nxe6 Qf5 17. Nxg7 Kxg7 18. Rf1 {nothing left for Black, than to retreat Qg5 or Qd6: Qh5 might be an option; Raf8 is only a move away...} Qxc2 {getting too greedy...} 19. Qxe5+ Kg8 20. Ba3 {we set up a mate attack...} Qxd2 {Black is oblivious...} 21. Bxc5 Rc8 22. Qe6+ {the deal breaker...} Kg7 23. Qxe7+ {and it is over...} Kh6 {and with this, Black resigned: after Be3+, Black can safely give up...}
