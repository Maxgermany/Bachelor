1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {This is Cordel Defence to Ruy Lopez, a rare choice for black. The most usual line of play for Black is 3...a6 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 Nf6 6. O-O Be7 7. c3 Na5 ....} Bc5 4. O-O d6 5. c3 Bd7 6. Ba4 a6 {Preparing a retreat square for the bishop at a7} 7. d4 {White wastes no time to gain advantage by attacking the center and trying to take control of central squares as quickly as possible and push black backwards and force him to place his his pieces on bad squares, and thus cutting off the coordination of enemy troops.} Bb6 8. Na3 {The knight heads for a strong outpost at c4 where it will be able to counter Black's queenside play and put pressure on the key squares of e5 and d6.} Nf6 9. Bc2 {Presently a defensive move but this Bishop will later prove a great asset along the b1-h7 diagonal to put pressure on Black's kingside.} Qe7 10. Nc4 {A normal looking move to develop the Queen, but delaying the King's safety is an error. White makes use of Black's lapse and gathers attacking resources while keeping Black busy on the defence of his pieces.} Ba7 11. Be3 O-O 12. Re1 Bg4 {Black hopes to benefit from this pin to gain time for development and delay the attack to gather the defensive forces, but the pin does'nt work quite as planned, rather it backfired in a sense.} 13. d5 Nd8 14. Bg5 {White will use this pin to his benefit, due to his advantage in development, and will weaken Black's kingside.} b5 15. Ne3 {The knight heads for the kingside for participating in the attack on Black Monarch.} Bh5 16. Nf5 {The start of an instructive king hunt.} Qd7 17. Bxf6 gxf6 18. Qd2 {Threatening Qh6 with mating attack, but black has no defence to stop the suspected Queen move.} Bg6 {Ne6 would have held out longer although white would still have large advantage.} 19. Qh6 Bxf5 {Forced, because Qg7# was threatened.} 20. exf5 Qe7 {Losing immediately. Black gives White a forced mate opportunity. Much better is Re8. Qe7 leads to 21.Ng5 fxg5 22.f6 Bxf2+ 23.Kh1 Bxe1 24.Qxh7# and checkmate.} 21. Ng5 {Black Resigns. If 21....fxg5 then....f6 would lead to mate on h7. A good example of how to exploit a poor defences around the king.}
