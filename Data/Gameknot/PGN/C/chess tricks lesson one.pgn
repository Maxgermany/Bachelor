1. e4 {..............AGREED...............} e5 {...........AGREED.................} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {....." The Ruy Lopez".......} Nf6 4. Bxc6 {Now the "" The Roy Lopez...Exchange Variation"".....an --aggresive-opening--for white...!!!} bxc6 {I choose to retake with the QPxB.. (d7-c6).....free's Blacks  Bishop on c-8....I dont like the "isolated" Rook Pawn on a-7...it will have to be -protected-by a piece other than another pawn..!!....I can live the with the -doubled- pawns on c-6 and c-7..they can still protect each other to a point.} 5. Nxe5 {......At this position...Nxe5.. removing Blacks Blacks King Pawn...seems a little to premature..but still an aggressive move.!!.....better for white is Re1...} Qe7 {Now you know why I would have castled and not..NxP.....Blacks Q-e7..!!...it may be "tempting"....to Nxp....but not "rewarding"..!!..( in my opinion)...} 6. d4 Nxe4 7. O-O {..........agreed.........Glad to " see " you castled..good..!!} c5 {Helping Blk to dispose of one of Doubled-Pawns and attacking whites-center pawn.!!..good.!!} 8. c3 {.......Better for white is R-e1...!!!..........If.. (8) R-e1...PxP.....(9) RxN...or.....(8) Re1...P-d5....(9) P-f3....N-f6-or-d6...(10) N-c6...!!..Whites Rook pinning Queen..cant move because of check..Black moves Be6 blocking Whites Rook...(11) NxQ...!!!...Better for Blk after.. (queens gone anyway).. Nc6..QxR Ck..QxQ ck.....~~also~~ (8).......Pf5..for Blk..????......(9) Q-h5 check..!!!..Pg6...(10) Nxg6...Qf7...(11) Nf4..QxQ...(12) NxQ...Kf7..un-pinning blacks knight~~OR~~(9) Qh5 ck....Kd8?????....(10) N-f7ck...Ke8 (11) NxR...discovered check winning Blks Rook and then if Blk moves(11).........Pg6..blocking Whites discovered check by the Queen..(12) Nxg6...Pxg6..(13) Qxg6 Ck...Qf7..(14).QxQck..KxQ...and white is ahead in pieces and has advantage to win...!!!} Bb7 {Good-Move for Blk..the Long-Diagonal Attack by the Bishop on B-7...."aims" right at Whites Castled King......Now where is that R-e1... I mentioned..???} 9. f3 {From this position...after Black moves knight to either (9>--N-f6-or-d6...White can move(10> R-e1..!!...Blk can ...(10>........castles....which seems the best move at this time....White can then move...the knight on (11>N- e5 to c6 ..exposing blacks queen to attack...Black can chose to reply by moving either...(11>...........Q-d6-or-Bxc6..each move has its own consequences....for example...(11> Nc6...Qd6..(12> NxR...KxN....( In My Opinion...Qd6 is the better of the 2-choices)..OR...(11> Nc6...Bxc6 (12> RxQ...BxR....at this last move (BxQ)..White will have-4-pieces including the Queen..along with 7-pawns.........Black will have 5-pieces but w/o Queen and 7-Pawns.... but, will still have a good game...!! ..White will not the easist time defeating Black.~~} Nf6 10. Be3 {..........BEST is still R-e1 for white....B-e3..isnt a bad move..still protects pawn and counters the threat by Blacks Bishop (Bc5) if Blk chooses to do so in the game..etc.If white wants to move Bishop..a possible move would be B-g5..!!..??....In this position...White is missing again and again opportunity to take advantage of Blacks un-castled King by moving R-E1..!! ..White may pay for that mistake later...} d6 {...AAahhhhh....the P-d6 move....Good- for Black...Bad for White...now White has a problem....the Bishop on e3.. is un-protected..If..White moves knight to..d3-or-c4...Black moves Qxb3 Ck... (QxB)....the possible  premature Knight attack move Nxe5...now is back-firing...} 11. Ng4 {.....Agree with Tamochancers comments..........the Knight is moved to g4..in order to protect Bishop...if Black decides to move Nxg4....known as.." " Removing The Protecter " ".....the Pawn on f3 protects the Knight..but what will be guarding the Bishop on e3..???....that move Re1 would have come in handy now...Bishop would have been Guarded by Rook on E-1...   ..??} Nxg4 {.......AGREED WITH COMMENTS......But its Rook to e1..not e8 as stated by Tamochancer ..} 12. Bf2 {..........Agreed with Tamochancer's Comments...........} Ne3 {Comments Agreed Upon........Good-Move for Black....!!!...White has some trouble.. but can still get out with BxN.....each piece White exchanges..is one less piece that will be in play in the -End Game-...but the game isnt over .....yet.....!} 13. Bxe3 {....As Would Be Expected....} Qxe3+ 14. Rf2 {......Whites Move...R-f2...not good...now Rook is Pinned....Best was K-h1....and Rook would have been free to move...opening an additional escape route by moving P-h3 still available later...} O-O-O {Relatively "safe" enough to castle QS..No immediate  threat from white...(if-any)...hopefully white can open the B-file and start an attack on Blacks King...!!..??..QS-Castling in this game does place King in Safety and brings Rook into immediate play...!!} 15. d5 Re8 {...Well...at least...Black moved...R-e1....!!!!!....Good-Move-4-Black..!!} 16. Nd2 {White..may have considered Na3 and then perhaps N-c2..depends on Blacks reply to N-a3...} Be7 {Blacks B-e7 is good...BUT...what about Bxd5..??..White was guarding his Pawn on d5 with the Queen..Knight moving to d2..Blocks Queens Protection of Pawn.......B-h4..is a possibility......Long Time ago...white should moved K-h1.....Not..R-f2..!!...Blacks Bishop Pair will be something White will have to deal with...} 17. Nc4 Qf4 {AGREED ON COMMENT ON N-h5 AND Qb3....also...Rook now un-pinned...} 18. Na5 {The Q-Side attack begins...although slightly...nothing for Black to worry about at this moment in the game...........Agree with comments} Ba8 19. c4 {..It would seem better to leave Pawn on c3..............} Bf6 {...B-f6...Excellent Move for Black...!!!!......If ..20.R-b1---B-d4 pinning / winning Rook on f2....White at this point might want to consider moving (20) R-f1   Bxb2...(21) Rb1   Bd4 check...(22) Kh1..from that point Black can move more aggresively with Re3..followed by R/1-e8..doubling the Rooks and a  Commanding Control over center with strong attacking possibilities....OR....Black can move...(21) Rb1  Bd4 ck...(22) Kh1 and then..Be5 threatening mate...!!..either way...Black Will Decide...!!!!!!!!!!} 20. b3 {...From Bad To Worse...!!...Whites Game is over....!!!...Just a matter of time now until Black places the "~Anaconda~~Squeeze~ " on white...!!!........." Error " by white is an --understatent--} Bxa1 21. Qxa1 {The Expected Move.....} Re5 22. Nc6 {...In Agreement....} Bxc6 {Indeed....in agreement...!!!} 23. dxc6 Rhe8 {...AAaahhhhh.....yes indeed....The End Draweth Near...!!...There will be no " Happy New Year "  for White today...!!} 24. Rf1 {Well..the Rook "finally"  moves.....but it is........... toooooo...... late.....} Qd4+ {ABSOLUTELY.........!!!......Excellent Move for Black...!!} 25. Qxd4 {NATURALLY} cxd4 26. f4 Re5e2 {THE END DRAWETH CLOSER.............AGREED W/COMMENTS} 27. h4 {AN ADDITIONAL  ESCAPE ROUTE AND....OR... JUST THE NORMAL  ""  WAITING FOR THE END MOVE "".....???} Rxa2 {AGREED....EVEN IF WHITE MOVES P-a4......BLK CAN STILL MOVE R-B2 ATTACKING A PAWN AND PREPARING FOR ROOK...R/8--E2} 28. Rf2 {BETTER MIGHT HAVE BEEN R-f1......((NOT... R-F2)).........Hmmmm......There will be No--Party for White..!!!} Rxf2 {~ ~ ~ THE DRAPES ARE DRAWN AND THE CURTAINS ARE CLOSING IN- ON THIS ""CHESS-STAGE ""  ~ ~ ~} 29. Kxf2 d3 {...........
