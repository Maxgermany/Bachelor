1. e4 {a scotch start intended but my opponent goes for phillidor defence} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {Bg5 pins the black knight but leads to nothing in my opinion} h6 {Even though I didn't pin the Knight my opponent seems to fear that possibility. He loses a first tempo I think.} 6. Be2 Be7 7. Be3 a6 {A second tempo loss? I wonder about the reasons of this move? Maybe Nonoanoop will tell us more. Maybe he fears pinned knights but an immediate Nc6 would seriously mine his pawn structure} 8. O-O {I have a huge lead in development because of the 5th and 7th black moves.} Nbd7 {Black gives me even more development lead by locking up his light squared bishop} 9. f4 {My lead in development causes black pieces to be a bit cramped. Lets push that and take more space} O-O 10. Nf5 {Going for the bishop pair} Nb6 11. Nxe7+ {I probably should have kept my powerful knight on f5.} Qxe7 12. Bd3 {targeting the black rocade} Bg4 13. Qe1 Bh5 14. Qg3 Bg6 {Black doesn't seem to realize his light squared bishop is getting completely locked up?} 15. f5 {black can't retreat his bishop to h7 as he loses a pawn on h6 with it. My queen pins the g7 pawn to the king.} Nh5 {doesn't really help ?! Wait and see ...} 16. Qg4 Nf6 {oh it does help ! black can force repetition. No bonus pawn for me.} 17. Qh4 {Planning to destroy the black pawn structure by doubling the f and g pawns} Bh7 18. Bxb6 {Initially planned to play Bd4. Considering how the black pawn structure would look with doubled pawns on the b and f files I willingly gave up my bishop pair. How wrong was I as you will see.} cxb6 19. Nd5 {oh my ... realized a few seconds after submitting this move that black could unpin his queen nicely by taking my knight on the way !} Qe5 {luckily for me Nonoanoop didn't realize this.} 20. Nxf6+ Qxf6 21. Qxf6 gxf6 {The pawn structure for which I was willingly giving up my bishop pair} 22. c3 b5 23. Bc2 {activating my bishop} Rac8 24. a3 a5 25. Bb3 Rc5 26. Rad1 Rd8 27. Rd5 b6 28. Rfd1 Rxd5 29. Rxd5 b4 30. axb4 axb4 31. cxb4 Kg7 32. Rd2 {I supposed that black would have taken the c file in possession with his rook and traded the rooks after which it would have been a king race. However with my active bishop contrary to black I was sure of being able to take the opposition leading me to victory.} Bg8 {my opponent seriously lacks planning. I don't see any reason for this move.} 33. Rc2 Re8 34. Bd5 h5 35. h4 {the black bishop is definitely locked up. I have practically had a piece of advance ever since move 15! The rest of the game is of no interest. Nonoanoop gave up realizing he had no moves to play.} Re7 36. Rc6 Ra7 37. Rxb6 Rd7 38. Rb8 Ra7 39. b5 Re7 40. b6 {Being my first annotated game, I will appreciate feed back.}
