[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 {Antijogo (1582) vs. stringplayer92 (annotator) (1682)  Some very sloppy opening mistakes, but then I capitalize on his capturing of a poison pawn.  An easy example of the power of the initiative.  This tactic reminds me of the old "see-saw" tactic with the rooks...  Hope you enjoy.} e6 {I like this move because of the flexibility.  I can transpose into either the French or Sicilian, both are openings I play.  Sometimes these "different" move orders will throw-off the players that simply copy opening books such as MCO.} 2. Nf3 {Here I made the choice to offer to transpose into the sicilian.  Though my main opening is the French, I get tried of playing against the exchange variation all the time.  Against the 1500-1600 range many players play the exchange.  Psychologically, I know that they are probably wanting to go into a simple game that is not in the main lines. } c5 3. d3 {Again, he avoids the heavily analyzed/unbalanced lines by choosing the Closed Sicilian} Nc6 4. e5 {This is not such a great move.  Though I didn't make the best reply: f6.  Instead I switch back to a more French looking line.} d5 5. c3 Qc7 {This was a mistake, losing a tempo.  In the normal french line, the Queen belongs on b6.  White has lost a tempo with d3 though, so it is simply evening out back into the original French lines.  If nothing else I have accomplished my goal of avoiding the exchange variations.} 6. d4 Qb6 {Where it should have gone originally.} 7. Be2 Nh6 {Planning to go to f5 and put more pressure on d4.  White does not want to play Bxh6, and give me the two bishops and a open g-file.  The Bxh6 lines, are some of my favorite to play as they are very imbalanced and black gets a quick attack.} 8. O-O Nf5 9. dxc5 {Releasing tension on the center.  This doesn't seem best.} Bxc5 {Developing a piece} 10. Bd3 O-O {I am not concerned about Bxf5, as this gives me 1) an open file to his weak e-pawn 2) his "good" bishop 3) the two bishops.} 11. Bxf5 {Yet he does it anyways...} exf5 12. Qxd5 {This was a definite poison, as you will see.  My pieces suddenly come alive with tempo after tempo and eventually winning a piece.} Be6 {Tempo #1} 13. Qd2 {Queen must stay on the d-file} Rad8 {Tempo #2} 14. Qc2 Bc4 {Tempo #3  Now the f2 square is weak.  If 15.Rd1 I win a free pawn with 15...Bxf2 (16.Qxf2 Rxd1  17.Ne1 Rxe1#)} 15. Re1 Bd3 {Tempo #4  Winning a piece now...} 16. Qd2 Bxb1 {Now I am  2.  Though I hate to "count" material by their static values like that.} 17. Qe2 Bd3 {Getting my bishop back out.} 18. Qd2 Be4 {Tempo #5  Notice how my bishop has gone from c8 all the way to the active e4, while White has developed nothing.} 19. Qe2 Rfe8 {Attacking the weak e5 pawn, and tying down the knight.} 20. b4 {It took a lot for me not to just play Bxb4 here, but I went for the "easy", slower route.} Bf8 21. Be3 {He finally activates his queenside.} Qc7 {Attacking the e5 pawn again} 22. b5 {Striking out, but it just drops a pawn...} Nxe5 23. Nxe5 Qxe5 24. f3 Bd3 {Winning another pawn.} 25. Qb2 Bxb5 {Notice though that he can't use the discovery from the bishop.  Ex. 26. Bb6 Qxe1  27.Rxe1 Rxe1  28.Kf2 Re2  29.Qxe2 Bxe2 30.Bxd8 Rxd8 31.Kxe2 and I am still up my piece and I have gotten most of the material off the board} 26. Bf2 Qd5 27. Bxa7 Qc4 28. Bd4 Ba6 {Just overprotecting everything in the spirit of Nimzowitsch.} 29. Bb6 Rdc8 30. Bd4 Re2 {"The absolute of the 7th rank" - - Nimzowitsch} 31. Rxe2 Qxe2 32. Qc1 {It's really just clean-up from here as white has absolutely nothing} Bc5 {Trading off pieces as I am up material} 33. Qf4 Bxd4+ 34. cxd4 Qc4 35. Re1 g6 36. g4 fxg4 37. fxg4 Qxa2 38. h4 Qd5 39. g5 Bb5 40. Qg4 Rd8 41. Rd1 Bc6 42. Kf2 Qf5+ 43. Qxf5 gxf5 44. Ke3 Kg7 45. h5 f6 46. Kf4 Be4 47. Rg1 {I will take free pawns...} Rxd4 48. h6+ Kf7 49. gxf6 Kxf6 50. Rg7 Bc6+ 51. Ke3 Rd7 52. Rg8 b5 53. Rc8 {And here he resigned.  Thanks for looking.}
