[Opening "Robatsch (modern) defence (B06)"]

1. e4 g6 {At first I thought he might try a hyper-modern opening...} 2. Nf3 {My standard preference as white, if I can play these two moves I will.} Bg7 3. Nc3 {I did this to see how badly he wanted to control that h8-a1 file. I delay moving the d pawn, just to see what his intentions are in the middle, because of how he opened. Perhaps this is a bit too passive as white, but I want an indication of whether black really intends to fight for the middle from afar, or if he has another plan altogether. Remember, I am not thinking I am going to win this game; his rating is by far the highest I've ever played against. As such, I have no clue as to what he could possibly be thinking, and I want a clue. Badly. ;)} c5 {Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Were I more knowledgeable about openings, I may have recognized this as his intention. Since I didn't initially recognize this black opening, I just develop pieces with the idea of attacking the Kingside later.} 4. Bc4 e6 {I expected that.} 5. O-O {Against a player this strong, with the black bishop not directly attacking the Kingside, I wanted to castle immediately, so at least to have a little King safety for a while before tactics against such a stronger player prove my downfall. In this position, I now feel comfortable that I have a few moves before major fireworks occur, unless black wishes to open up the middle immediately. I don't expect him to, because players of his caliber prefer complicated positions, generally speaking.} Nc6 {Expected.} 6. d3 {Now remember, I don't know openings this far in. To me, this position is not the best for white. I am trying to tempt him to take my knight with that black bishop in return for a screwed up white pawn position. I am still, to be honest, intimidated by his rating. It's a real weapon, psychology in chess. And so I right now have played rather passively. Things will soon change.} Nge7 {Wasn't Nf6 a possibility here? He wishes to castle, and now hints of tactics are in play.} 7. a3 {Here I simply create a retreat for my white bishop. I really did not even think he'd consider putting the black knight on b4 at all; this is solely so my bishop can flee and remain on the a2-g8 diagonal. } O-O {Now this is perfectly fine for black, but now I am beginning to form my own real plan, and I'm glad he's finally castled Kingside. Why? Here's why: against a much stronger player, why not launch an attack against his Kingside in a most... ugly way, perhaps he'll underestimate the danger against someone rated so much lower! It's worth a shot; perhaps I don't give myself enough credit, but honestly, in a long positional struggle, I think this player would eat me alive, so to speak!} 8. Be3 {This is a slow plan, and easily thwarted but black lets me do this.} d6 {This move surprises me. Is it the most accurate? I really don't know, but I don't trust it. It looks rather passive... I would have thought by now he'd be blowing up the queenside, and then grind me down with superior chess. This looks suspiciously like a Sicilian. Which, I might add, I LIKE playing against as white. It is a pet peeve of mine that so many black players play the Sicilian, so I have spent a lot of personal time developing my own way of defeating it, which usually works if black playes too passively. The whole point of the Sicilian is to play aggressively... and black fails to do this. This IS a Sicilian, now, is it not? Dragon formation? And to the comment on ...d5, perhaps you are right. But white can get two pawns, and perhaps black did not want the point for the central pawn control. I ought to analyze that continuation; it's possible he was playing so fast he missed it, and I confess I did not see it.} 9. Qd2 {Completing development, and finally preparing for active play.} a6 {And it looks like black is finally getting around to doing something on the queen side. Well, let him. I have my own plans now.} 10. Rab1 {This is a purely defensive move, the last one I'll really make.} b5 {Expected.} 11. Bb3 {And now, why did I stop here you may wonder. My reasoning is I want him to play c4, so I am trying to provoke him into it. But, he isn't ready to do that yet. The white bishop is very uncomfortable right now, but I'm willing to suffer it. Black has tactics now on the queenside. In a normal Sicilian, black would push hard against the queenside. But... I'm castled on the Kingside. So what he does next makes sense, I suppose.} Bb7 {Developing and now I wonder if he's really contemplating a kingside move when to my eyes a black queenside push is still called for. His pieces are not fully coordinated in my opinion... not yet. But looking at this as we played quickly, I felt sure his position was still superior to white's. So I decided to change things up some.} 12. Bh6 {My good bishop was actually doing very little. I'd rather trade these off, and then try to take advantage of the resulting dark-squared weaknesses. I am sure black had something good coming for him, and I couldn't wait to just let him do what he wished to. No doubt some analysis here would show things I missed, or he missed; but this was a blitz game, and as noted, I'm still intimidated. I only wish to give him a decent game, and lose graciously.} Nd4 {If I were to guess, I'd say this was a great move by black. He wants to crash those pawns down, and does so threatening my white bishop at the same time. I took a moment to consider options here, and decided I could not let that knight sit there at all, nor allow black to initiate the pawn trades. So...} 13. Nxd4 {I took it.} cxd4 {Pxd4. I expected that. This next move to me is a no brainer and forced him into a move he did not wish to make, I think. Perhaps he did not think this all the way through; after all, it was a blitz game.} 14. Ne2 e5 {Protecting the pawn. But this is a passive move. Now, at this point, I would be worried about black playing f5 eventually if he also had pressure down the c file. But because of the white square white bishop, and lack of c file pressure, this is not a real concern at this point to me, not yet. Right now, I am worried about ...d5, despite my bishop. Why am I worried? I don't want to allow black to begin to break through to my king. Black has played - in my eyes - amazingly passive up to this point. I don't understand it, but hey. Finally I can begin to make the moves I've been waiting to make.} 15. Bxg7 {Now many of you chess players out there may be tempted to accuse me of throwing away my black bishop for no compensation. His black bishop at this point is not doing much. But that's not the point. Here's my point: looking ahead, that black bishop, with an open center - which black can open eventually - will be a major pain. And how useful is my bishop really in this position? Yes, it's in a good place. But I'd rather loosen up Black's kingside immediately by trading that bishop now, even though some of you will disagree. Even though that means the black king will be off the a2-g8 diagonal. Will I be proved right here? Probably not without inaccurate play by the 2375 Yakimov, but I do it anyways.} Kxg7 {Retakes.} 16. f4 {And now, I finally get in f4. This is what I have wanted to do since very early in the game. And it is right here that my opponent makes, in my estimation, the move that allows him to lose this game.} f6 {Okay, what is up here. I don't see what he's thinking. I definitely don't want e5.} 17. f5 {Yes, I am willing to trade pawns, open the center, and allow threats against my white King, because black's King right now will be horribly exposed. To his credit, black realizes this, but now I have created a chink in black's armor, and I pursue it. Would analysis indicate opening up the position to be survivable for black and give him a great attack on my King? I'm not sure. My king is also on g1, and perhaps ought to be on h1, but as it turns out, it did not need to be.} g5 {I really did not expect this. I expected a bloody battle up there around f5. Black can really hit back now in the center, and break things wide open, and in my estimation - again without analysis - should do so immediately, if nothing else but to get rid of my powerful white bishop. I fully expect him to soon. The white squares around black's king are very weak, and the black squares are not all that secure. I am really loving my white bishop right now.} 18. Ng3 {This really shouldn't get anywhere, but black mishandles things on the kingside shortly.} Qe8 {I expected that.} 19. Qe2 {Again, I see all kinds of black tactics available here. All I am doing now is trying to infiltrate the black kingside. I am hoping to get in h4, and begin wreaking havoc on the black king.} Rh8 {Well, black chose to defend, and creates a space for his King to flee to. But was there a better thing to do? I've heard it said that the best defense is a good offense, but black is still passive here, despite all the tactical threats I can see. Look at how my white pawns inhibit my activity on the queenside. I really don't have much there at all besides my white squared bishop. A powerful counterattack in the middle/queenside by black a bit earlier may have changed this game's outcome but now black is going to face serious difficulties. On his part, should black have played d5 by now?} 20. Nh5+ {Here black thought a while. He has to know that h4 is coming. Suddenly, that white bishop is a powerhouse. He'll have to do something about it soon.} Kf8 {The only move. Unless he were willing to give up his queen. I've played games against someone who always gets their queen out and takes a pawn, so as to give me queen odds. I have yet to beat him too, amazingly enough. I don't know who it is, but each time we play, I come tantalizingly close to beating him, only to lose to his greatly superior positional strength. I'm sure many of you have played that player too. Just sayin. I have to say this in this game; I used it once in a previously annotated game. But black has simply dithered around too long. Perhaps he was interested in just seeing what I would do, maybe just looking for ideas for later thought. After all, this is an unrated game. And I'm totally random to him.} 21. Nxf6 {This is practically forced for white to do.} Qc8 {So black's king is in big trouble now. Perhaps black thought he'd survive the storm with a crushing attack down on the white's kingside. I don't know. Black can resign now, but plays on for a while. Why do I say black can resign? Because not only is he down material, his King has no where to run and he won't muster up a good enough defense to stop white's attack. I still can't believe this player, with this rating, allowed this position to be reached.} 22. Qh5 d5 {Too little, too late. This should have happened ages ago.} 23. exd5 Kg7 {Well this is now not worth commenting on to be honest, and I don't mean that to be offensive. It's just chess.} 24. Qxg5+ Kf8 25. Qh6+ Kf7 {Forced.} 26. d6+ Nd5 27. Nxd5 {And with this move, black resigned although he could have resigned much earlier. He wanted a rematch, but I declined. I felt sure he'd promptly show me what he was really capable of, and I myself just got off of a 12 hour night shift, and was tired. Moral of the story: yes, you can play too passively, and lose games you should not lose.}
