1. e4 {I start off with my usual and am interested in how James will respond.} Nf6 {My anticipation was 1...e5 since I was used to playing the Spanish Opening.  Having said that, I realized why this was played.  As James knew my style, which I was, previously, warned about.  And, he had no intention of letting me play that opening, as his idea was taking me off guard.  The idea, which Fred knows too well was defeating me so that I would stop posting stuff that I didn't know.} 2. Nc3 {I also could've played 2.d3, but I decided to protect this way.  The reason being is that it develops which is what I wanted to do right away.} e6 {Getting his Bf8 ready for action.} 3. Bc4 {Nothing else came into consideration except for development.  On the other hand, I would, nowadays, respond with 3.e5, in this position to harrass the N.  It goes along with what Susan noted in, I believe it was, the Steintz Variation of the French Defense to gain tempo.  And, after something like 3...Nb8, I'd play that.  And, if, instead, black were to answer with 3...Nd5, I'd exchange right away to double up blacks pawn.} d5 {Taking advantage of that, James goes right on the attack.  Without thinking too much about it, I go right into exchanging.  My thinking back then was exchange whenever possible, as that was Jack's advice against stronger opponents.  Ken rightly noted that this way of thinking is wrong on so many levels, and I weighed that right in with how Jack teaches chess.} 4. exd5 exd5 5. Bd3 c5 {I didn't see the point behind this move, but I now realize that James had something planned with the pawns.} 6. Nf3 {My only thinking here was development and castling which upset bhidragon at the time.  As that's still little things.  And, after our rated game, he said that I had to stop going for the little things and go for the hard stuff, the overall picture.  The overall picture means the entire board, and by difficult stuff, he meant becoming a hard worker which never happened.  And, that's what upset others with me, but it's also why I'm quite unhappy with Jack.} Bg4 {My thinking allowed this pin which I don't like.} 7. Be2 {And, that's why I break it, at once.  I believe that better, however, would've been 7.h3.  My thinking was based on what Jack also taught.  He said that when you're N is pinned to the Q or K, you're best off breaking it with the B.  Ken told me that this way of thinking is also flawed.  A lot of times, it's better to break the pin with a or h pawn, as using the B is, often, too passive.} Nc6 {Continuing with his development.} 8. O-O {I stuck with the idea that one should castle early and often as a GM put it and did that right here.  In other words, nothing else came into consideration, and while the move works, this way of thinking doesn't.  The reason being is that, in a previous annotation, nuntar quoted a GM who said that sometimes castling early can be costly.} Bd6 {Continuing with his development.  But, it didn't occur to me that James was planning a devastating attack against my K side.  It makes perfect sense, however, as this how bhidragon set it up when I played a bad move which is something that I showed on chess.com with the sleep deprivation thread.  After that game, bhidragon said, "a more experienced player would not have even considered that move."} 9. Nb5 {Trying to exchange James Bd6 due to my flawed thought process about exchanging whenever possible.} Bb8 {But, James doesn't allow it, as similarly, there's more that can be done with his B.  And, it'll be used later when I overlook a threat that's coming.} 10. b3 {I also could've played 10.d3.  My thinking was to complete my development, at once.  But, I wanted that nice long diagonal which is the logic behind this fianchetto.} a6 {Not the best choice since James goes after my N, which I'm used to.} 11. Nc3 Qd6 {And, that' when James prepares for the K side attack which is quite nasty for me.  I need to be very careful, but as with bhidragon, I missed the overall picture here.} 12. Bb2 {?? As my only thought process was complete development, and nothing else came into consideration.  But, 12.g3 was essential, as now I must lose a piece, if I'm to avoid mate.} Bxf3 {Having said that, this is the position that I have in my profile.  Similar to my next move, since I didn't want to lose a piece here, I missed the same mate threat in a similar position with Jack.  And, I was yelled at for doing this by Jack since he felt that I knew too much and was just too good at the game to make that kind of blunder.  But, he didn't base it on how much experience I really had, however.} 13. Bxf3 Qxh2# {}
