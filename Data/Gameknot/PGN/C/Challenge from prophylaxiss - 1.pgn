1. e4 {Sicilian Defense, Najdorf Variation, Byrne-English Attack, B90} c5 {My opponent's favorite defense to 1. e4 is the Sicilian Najdorf.  "Know the opponent and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril.  When you are ignorant of the opponent but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal.  If ignorant both of your opponent and of yourself, you are certain in every battle to be in peril."  Sun Tzu, The Art of War, 3:31-33.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f4 {This move will enable White to exchange his kingside flank f-pawn for Black's center e-pawn, thereby creating a half-open f-file for White, along with a central e4 vs. d6 pawn space advantage.  Typically, in this line, White will castle long and attack kingside, while Black will castle short and attack queenside.  Control of the center will be extremely important for both sides.  Space, structure, and strategy are the 3 S's which are deemed essential opening principles in the philosophy of the Chinese School of Chess, as delineated by Liu Wenzhe, in his insightful and revealing book.} exf4 9. Bxf4 Nc6 10. Qe2 Rc8 {Bringing the queenside rook to useful work, as Lasker would say, on the half-open c-file, which will help to put pressure on White's long castled king...White also needs to be mindful of possible sacrifices of this rook for the knight on c3 in these types of positions...} 11. h3 Be7 {The usual move here is 11...g6, although this move looks better because it does not weaken the kingside like the "normal" line of 11...g6 and 12...h5.  However, it will lead to the loss of the d6 pawn in three moves (and eventually the game), but Black is hoping to have enough compensation for the pawn in unleashing a vicious queenside attack on White's king...} 12. O-O-O O-O 13. g4 Nd7 14. Bxd6 Bxd6 15. Rxd6 Qe7 16. Rd1 Na5 {16...Nc5 looks like a better move since it puts more pressure not only on the queenside, but also the center; a maxim that Nimzowitsch constantly preached...} 17. Nd5 Nxb3+ {Black does White a favor here by exchanging pieces while still being a pawn down, even though White's castled queenside pawn structure is slightly weakened in the process...} 18. axb3 Qd8 19. Kb1 Re8 20. Qf2 Ne5 21. Be2 Rc6 {21...Qa5 looks like a more aggressive and threatening move, as Black must now not delay, but immediately launch an attack on White's weakened queenside by pushing its own queenside pawns, and reinforcing them with supportive rooks and queen, bishop and knight...} 22. Qd4 Bxd5 {Again, Black exchanges pieces, but this one was nearly forced, since White's beautifully outposted knight controlled so much territory on the board...} 23. exd5 {...and in return White gets a beautifully-placed advanced passed pawn...} Rc7 {23...Rd6 may have been a more effective move here, but Black wants to double her rooks on the e-file for hopeful counterplay on the only open file on the board...} 24. Rhe1 Rce7 25. d6 {...but Black's plan of doubling rooks leads to White, not Black, being able to attack on the queenside, beginning with this powerful cramping and severely-obstructing central push...} Re7e6 26. Qb4 {...and now after Black's next move, Black's b-pawn is gone, exchanged for White's powerful passed pawn, but 26...b5 27. c4 bxc4 28. Bxc4 Nc6 29. Qd2 Rxe1 30. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 31. Qxe1 still keeps White a pawn up with all rooks off the board, thereby lessening Black's chances to pull out a draw...} a5 27. Qxb7 Rxd6 28. Qb5 {Again, Black is forced to exchange pieces, since White's powerful rooks control the center, and with each exchange of pieces, White is that much closer to victory...} Rxd1+ 29. Rxd1 Qe7 30. Bf1 Ng6 {30...g6 would of course still lead to the loss of the a-pawn with 31. Qxa5.  Black can resign, since White now has an offside majority of 3 powerfully-connected passed pawns, with no effective counterplay or compensation in sight for Black...the rest as they say, is just a matter of technique, and Black resigns after five more moves...} 31. Qxa5 Rc8 32. b4 Nf4 33. b5 g6 34. b6 Rb8 35. Qa7 {}
