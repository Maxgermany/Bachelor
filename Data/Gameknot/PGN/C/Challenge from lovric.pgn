1. e4 e5 2. f4 {White plays the king's gambit here.  Black usually does ok with exPf4.} Qf6 {Norwalde Variation of the King's Gambit.} 3. Nf3 {Bueker Gambit of the Norwalde Variation...} Qxf4 {Black generally does pretty well taking this pawn--even at the risk of getting the queen chased (which slows development).} 4. d3 {White counter threats, while protecting the e pawn.} Qf6 5. Bg5 Qb6 6. b3 f6 7. Bh4 Qa5+ 8. c3 g5 9. Bf2 d5 10. exd5 Qxd5 11. c4 Bb4+ 12. Nbd2 Qa5 13. Be2 Nc6 14. O-O g4 15. Ne1 Bxd2 16. Bxg4 Bxg4 17. Qxg4 Nh6 {Ne2 might have been better--O-O-O would then protect the h rook while sacrificing only Pf6.  But the knight is protected by Bd2.  This Nh6 actually looks like black's best response.} 18. Qh5+ Kf8 19. Nc2 Qc3 20. Ne3 Nf7 21. Nd5 Qxd3 22. Bc5+ Nd6 23. Rxf6+ Kg7 24. Raf1 Qg6 25. Rxg6+ hxg6 26. Qg4 b6 27. Bxd6 cxd6 28. Qd7+ Kg8 {Oops.  Qf7#} 29. Qf7# {}
