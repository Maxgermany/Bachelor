[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), two pawns' attack, Mikenas variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 4. c5 {Lasker's attack is ambitious try for White in Alekhine's defence. After this move White secured a spatial advantage in space, but the d5 square and two pawns has been weakened. } Nd5 5. Bc4 {5.Nc3 is sharper, but 5.Bc4 gains more stable advantage.} e6 {Main lines are 5...e6 and 5...c6, but 5...c6 hardly blocks knight on b8 (though there's an option b7-b5).} 6. Qf3 {Main lines are 6.d4, 6.Nc3, 6.Bxd5!? and probably the most aggressive 6.Qg4!?, but White (probably) choose other plan - to get off Black knight from centre. } Bxc5 7. Nh3 {? - White should play 7.Nc3 and then Ne4 or develop bishop on c1, but shouldn't take knight on the rim.} Nc6 {Threatens ...Nxe5.} 8. Bxd5 exd5 9. Qxd5 Qe7 10. O-O d6 {Black decision was opening file g to attack White king (with next ...Bxh3 and gxh3).} 11. Re1 Bxh3 12. d4 {This move opens diagonal c1-h6 for White bishop and disables ...Qg5, but loses pawn.} Bxd4 13. e6 O-O 14. gxh3 Qf6 {With this move Black threatens mate in 4 moves.} 15. Bg5 {A terrible blunder, after which White should resign.} Qxf2+ 16. Kh1 Qxe1+ 17. Kg2 Qf2+ 18. Kh1 Qg1# {}
