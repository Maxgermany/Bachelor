1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ne5 Nf6 6. Bc4 d5 7. exd5 Bd6 8. O-O {The Rice Gambit, as played by Rice himself.} Bxe5 9. Re1 {Pinning.} Qe7 10. c3 g3 11. d4 {Winning back the pinned piece.} Ng4 12. Nd2 Qxh4 13. Nf3 {As long as the black King stays where it is, White can take the Bishop at any time. So White improves his position rather than rushing into a recapture.} Qh6 14. Qa4+ c6 {A mistake. Now White can drop his Queen onto a diagonal that prevents Black from castling.} 15. Qa3 {And he does.} Nf2 16. Rxe5+ {White recaptures his piece without losing a tempo.} Be6 17. Kf1 Qh1+ 18. Ng1 Nh3 {A dubious sacrifice. Black loses a powerfully posted attacking piece to free a file for his Pawn.} 19. gxh3 f3 20. Bg5 {With four pieces to one involved, White's attack is more potent than Black's.} Qg2+ 21. Ke1 f2+ 22. Kd2 f1=N+ 23. Kd3 Kd7 {With this move, ceding the initiative, Black seals his fate.} 24. dxe6+ {The final attack begins... and is conducted brilliantly.} Kc7 25. Qe7+ Kb6 26. Qd8+ Rxd8 27. Bxd8# {A sparkling finish.}
