[Opening "Sicilian (B58), classical"]

1. e4 {I wasn't sure what would play.  But, Charles is used to this and is ready to answer with the Sicilian, as it's his favorite.  It's now about what variation of this defense, it'll become.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {I'm so used to seeing 2...c6  But, Charles has played this before.  It can either be the opened or closed variation, as he annotated a while back.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {It's the Open Variation, but I don't know what this is called.  It's certainly not the Dragon or Nadjorf Sicilian, to say the least.} 6. Bg5 {Developing, but I would've developed the Bf1.  As my idea of a good time is finding a way to castle short, ASAP, which, of course, isn't always the way to go.} Bd7 {Meanwhile, Charles also continues with his development.} 7. Bc4 {As does white.} Rc8 {Threatening the masked battery on white Bc4.  But, I would've fiachetto'd since I'd want that nice long diagonal for the Bf8 which is my general thinking.  However, I like the move played almost as well.} 8. Bb3 {And, I like this move even more.} Qb6 {Putting pressure on white's Q side.  But, I really like what white does next.  And, it's also how I'd respond since Charles will wind up with doubled pawns here.  That can be of an asset later on.  And, we get into a series of exchanges which is something that I'd like, from white's perspective.} 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Qd2 {Completing his development and getting the Q mobile.} Rg8 {Going right after g2.  But, I wonder if Charles will follow through on that since a pawn like this is often the poisoned pawn.  Where taking would often lose a major piece.} 12. g3 {Well, with this move, I figured out that it isn't.  And, I see why, as white would have isolated pawns, if Charles were able to take.} Bg4 {Focusing on K side operations, as I've also seen in Charles past annotations.} 13. O-O {I also would've castled, and it gets interesting here.} h5 {I think the idea is to get a passed pawn.  I've seen it happen and even did it once, where I moved the pawn up right behind the B.  But, that was my thinking, and it worked.  I don't remember exactly when, but it was a long while back.} 14. Rae1 {Centralizing one of his R.  I think I would've done the other, as 14.Rfe8, would allow white to later play Rad8 which would be me idea.  As I like the idea of having both R's, in the center.} Qc5 {I don't see the point behind this move since it's still on the same diagonal.  The only thing I can figure is that Charles might be planning to exchange Q's or play ...Qe5.} 15. Kg2 {I also don't see the point behind this move because we're not near the end game.  On the other hand, there's a lot that I don't know.} h4 {Trying to break through on the K side.  I saw something similar once, questioned it in that annotation, and that's what Ken said.} 16. Qf4 {But, white stops that.} Qh5 {Trying to stick to the same plan.  } 17. h3 {I, originally, didn't see the point behind this move.  But, it is necessary.  If white didn't play this, Charles would have 17...h3+, and at the very least, white's Q will fall.  However, white's still in a lot of trouble. } hxg3 18. hxg4 {As he sacs a piece, similar to what Tom Polgar's annotation.  That's where a master defeated and later checkmated a GM by sacking a piece, like here.  } Rxg4 19. Qd2 Bh6 {We've got a nice combination going here.} 20. Rfh1 {White's intention is to exchange Q's.  But, Charles will win a R, in return.} Bxd2 21. Rxh5 Bxe1 22. Rh8+ {Trying to win back a piece.  The hope, as mine would be, is 22...Rg8?? where white would take with check.  But, I'm not surprised that Charles doesn't allow it.  In fact, I was, at first surprised to see white liquidate, as I would, instead, retreat.  But, white is forced to do to prevent Charles from winning another pawn with ...Bxf2.  So, after this happens, it becomes necessary for white to exchange his f pawn.} Kd7 23. Rxc8 Kxc8 24. fxg3 Rxg3+ 25. Kh2 Re3 {And, this is where white resigned.  It's appropriate here, as Charles will further liquidate with 26...Bxc3, and after, of course, 27.bxc3, white is free to take either pawn.  In my opinion, he'd play 27...Rxe4, as opposed to, 27...Rxc3.  As that involves a center pawn, and white would be left with 2 bad pawns since they're isolated and on the same file.  But, I was surprised at, just, how fast this game was.  And, I'm glad that Charles showed this in his profile.}
