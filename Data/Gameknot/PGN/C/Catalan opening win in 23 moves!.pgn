1. Nf3 {I start with Nf3: my idea was to get into a comfortable English opening without schemes with e5 and a reverse dragon to be reached. I wanted to get into a low-risk game but as the game turned out I went into complications.} e6 2. c4 {Following my plan.} d5 {2...c5 was possible getting into Symmetrical English.} 3. d4 {A quick change of feel and getting into a Catalan opening that is very popular at the recent years to chess community.} dxc4 {My opponent tries to play the position as a Queens gambit accepted. } 4. g3 c5 {The modern variation of the Catalan: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 dxc4 5.Bg2 c5 is relevant to the variation played above but the difference is that king's knight is not yet developed.} 5. Na3 {I play this position for the first time. The very first game that comes to mind is the second game of the World Chess Championship 2010 where Anand managed to win the game against Topalov where he sacrificed a central pawn for queenside activity and well-developed pieces. I tried to get some ideas from that game where I had it fresh in my mind as I saw it live in April.} cxd4 6. Nxc4 {White sacrifices a pawn for queenside activity and well-developed pieces as mentioned above. Also, Nf3-Ne5-Nd3- the d4 pawn will be blockaded.} Nc6 7. Bg2 Nf6 8. O-O Be7 {Bc5 was a more active square for the bishop.} 9. Bd2 O-O 10. Rb1 {Trying to advance the b-pawn to b4 and b5 to kick the knight. } Qd5 {A mistake that allows White to take a complete control of the position.} 11. Nfe5 {The most energetic move.} Qc5 {A second mistake. Trying to defend the knight but the knight will be lost in a few moves. 11...Qd8 is surely to be recommended instead of 11...Qc5 although things were looking good for white.} 12. b4 {12.b4!} Nxb4 {The right move not to lose on the spot. My opponent thought for a long time. The critical moment is that 12...Qb5 13.a4 Qa6 14.b5!: not only forking the queen and knight with the pawn but the queen is simply trapped.} 13. Bxb4 Qc7 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Qxd4 {Regaining one pawn back. White rules out the position.} Rd8 16. Qh4 {The most energetic place for the queen as it pins the f6 knight to the queen and getting  it into an aggressive position.} Rb8 {A mistake. Although the position was still lost with a piece down for Black for a pawn.} 17. Nc6 {! I am winning the exchange by this move.} bxc6 18. Rxb8 Qc7 19. Qf4 {Any move will do here. 19.Rbb1 or Rfb1 were also good moves. I think this move is more forcing as it forces Black to exchange Queens and go into a lost endgame with a piece down and weak and isolated pawns on a7 and c6.} Qd7 {A mistake. I don't even know why he keeps playing on. The position after 19.Qf4 is very well resignable.} 20. Ne5 {! Black does not have a chance after this move. The c6 pawn will fall with tempo! } Qc7 {What else? Losing also was 20...Nd5 21.Nxd7 Nxf4 22.gxf4..White gains another piece since the pin on d8 and back rank issues. } 21. Nxc6 e5 {This gets ridiculous! } 22. Qxe5 Rd6 {A blunder that quickly ends the game at once.} 23. Qxd6 {! Continuation with queen captures queen leads to mate as 23...Qxd6 24.Rxc8+ Qf8(24...Ne8 25.Rxe8 Qf8 26.Ne7+ Kh8 27.Rxf8++) 25.Ne7+ Kh8 26.Rxf8 Ng8 27.Rxg8++. I play the Catalan a lot lately with good results. Although I wanted a really low-risk game it transposed into a wild game which I was happy to win it. 1-0 Opponent resigns.}
