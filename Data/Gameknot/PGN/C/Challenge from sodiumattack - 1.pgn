[Opening "French (C00), Labourdonnais variation"]

1. e4 e6 {Rocason and I started playing fast games playing French defense, which we both like.} 2. f4 {This move characterizes the Labourdonnais variation. White gains space on the Kingside but the drawback is that the d2-d4 push will become more difficult.} c5 {The main continuation is 2. ... d5 followed by 3. e5 c5. Anyway soon or later Black will push his c-pawn.} 3. Nf3 a6 4. c3 {Slowly preparing d2-d4.} d5 5. e5 Nh6 {Heading to f5 where Knight can control d4.} 6. Na3 {Slowly... again, preparing d2-d4. Q-Knight has to go to c2 to sustain the pawn push. White sometimes plays Bd3-Bxf5 and only at that point push d2-d4.} Nc6 7. Nc2 Bd7 8. d4 {At the eighth move White achieve this push.} Qb6 9. Bd3 cxd4 10. cxd4 Nf5 {Notice that a little tactical trick protects d-pawn three times. If 11. ... Nfxd4?? 12. Nfxd4 Nxd4 13. Be3! and Black loses a light piece.} 11. O-O Rc8 12. Kh1 {Removes the King from the pin, prepares g2-g4 and frees the g1-square for the Rook.} Be7 {(?!) Marked as inaccuracy by the computer analysis. 12. ... h5 would have a more aggressive defense.} 13. g4 Nh4 {Better choice than Nh6 which would force Black in a restricted and passive position on the Kingside.} 14. Nxh4 Bxh4 15. f5 {Logical and consequent. Of course 15. ... exf5 16. gxf5 ~ 17. Qg4! with winning attack.} h6 16. Be3 {(?!) Marked as inaccuracy by the computer analysis, which suggests 16. Bd2.} Qxb2 {(?!) I mark this as a dubious move... I am always on guard when a "poisoned pawn" position occurs. I would have preferred something like Bg5 to exchange pieces and lower the pressure.} 17. Rb1 Qxa2 {Now Black is two pawns up. White can gain back one immediately with 18. Rxb7 placing a Rook in the 7th rank, but I preferred to increase the pressure.} 18. Qe2 Nd8 19. Rba1 {It starts the Queen-chasing!} Qb3 20. Rfb1 Qc3 21. Bd2 Qc7 22. Ba5 Qb8 23. fxe6 {(!?) Marked as mistake by the computer analysis... but I don't agree. :) White can plays 23. Bxa6 but the purpose is not win back material but keep the initiative and attack. This move appeared and appears to me the logical consequence of White's plan.} Bxe6 {(?!) Marked as inaccuracy by the computer analysis, which suggests Nxe6. The bishop is a bad blocker and the Knight would be more effective in that square.} 24. Ne3 {Heading to f5.} O-O 25. Nf5 Bg5 26. h4 {(?!) Again, marked as inaccuracy by the computer analysis, which suggests 29. Bb4. Probably I was too enthusiastic.} Bxf5 27. gxf5 Bxh4 {Now White is down by three pawns.} 28. Bd2 {Aims to h6.} f6 29. Qh5 {And the situation became critical!} Bf2 {(!) I liked this move, I just thought about 29. Bg5. Since White's plan is to sacrifice the Bishop on h6-pawn and then take a Rook to h2 via the Ra1-a2-h2 maneuver, this move slows that.} 30. Bxh6 Rc7 {It's trivial but 30. ... gxh6?? 31. Rg1+ Bxg1 32. Rxg1+ Rh7 33. Qg6+ Rh8 34. Qxh6#.} 31. Rbg1 {I was really proud of this idea, computer analysis says it's a blunder (so a move marked with one or two question marks). It suggests 31. Ra2... I thought about not losing tempo with the Black bishop and force Black to capture the Rook. Maybe a bad evaluation?} Bxg1 {Forced.} 32. Rxg1 Nc6 33. Rg6 {The threat is clear: 33. ... ~ 34. Bxg7 and if 34. ... Rxg7 35. Rh6! and there's no way to avoid the mate with Rook and Queen on the H file.} Qe8 34. exf6 {Again, if 34. ... ~ 35. Bxg7 wins.} Qe1+ {Only this way.} 35. Rg1 Qxg1+ 36. Kxg1 gxh6 37. Qg6+ {Notice the importance of the intermediate move: White has to capture h6 pawn giving check. If 37. Qxh6? Rcf7! blocks the f-pawns and White doesn't have much more than perpetual check.} Kh8 38. Qxh6+ {A nice trick to analyze the position is the "check-capture-attack-positional" way of thinking.} Kg8 39. Qg5+ {This is not trivial. Why 39. Qg5+ and not 39. Qg6+? Think about it and look at move 41.} Kh8 40. f7 Rfxf7 {Either with f or c-Rook Black has to capture.} 41. f6 {If White played 39. Qg6+ Kh8 40. f7 Rfxf7 41. f6 Black would have 41. ... Rg7! 42. fxg7 Rxg7, Queen and endgame lost. With the Queen in g5 White can interpose Bg6.} Nxd4 42. Qxd5 {Now White gain forcefully material.} Rc1+ 43. Kg2 Rxf6 44. Qh5+ Kg7 45. Qg5+ {Computer analysis give White a big advantage in previous moves... 42. ... Rc1+ doesn't seem a decisive error, if 42. ... Rcd7 (defending the Knight, keeping connected the Rooks) then 43. Qh5+ Kg8 44. Bc4 wins the Rook.} Kf7 46. Qxc1 Ne6 47. Qc4 {And pinning, and forking, and checking.} b5 48. Qd5 Ke7 49. Qb7+ Kf8 50. Qc8+ Kg7 51. Qd7+ Kf8 52. Kg3 {Of course the King has to partecipate actively in the endgame.} Ng7 53. Qd4 Ne8 54. Be4 Rd6 55. Qc5 Ke7 56. Bf5 Kd8 57. Kf4 {Black resigns and thanks rocason for this and the other nice games!}
