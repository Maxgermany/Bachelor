1. e4 {This is a game I played against perrinnn - he did well until he faced an unstoppable mate and resigned - enjoy.} e5 {Normal.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Normal.} 3. Bc4 Nf6 {Again, normal.} 4. Nc3 {This occurred in one of jkarp's games against redfox17. And now, if black plays Nxe4 Nxe4 and d5! this gives black an open game with good development - but I think that after Nxe4 5. Bxf7+! Kxf7 6. Nxe4 is better.} d5 {He goes straight in for the kill.} 5. exd5 {The variation after exd5 is usually e4! and PXN PxN 8. cxb7 Bxb7 is better for black.} Nd4 {Now two pawns are lost via Nxe5.} 6. Nxe5 Qd6 {Whoosh, no doubt threatening Qxe5.} 7. O-O {[!] I actually overlooked Qxe5 here. } Qxe5 {But, only just then ...} 8. Re1 {I realised I could pin the queen.} Ne2+ {This doesn't help much, but loses a knight.} 9. Rxe2 {Still pinning and winning.} Bd6 {I actually prefer Qxe2, but this is quite the same.} 10. Rxe5+ Bxe5 11. Qe2 {Now I pin the bishop. I could only see two good moves, Nd7 or Ng4, but Ng4 fails to h3.} O-O {? I could see what Black was planning. After 12. Qxe5! Re8 13. Qf4 Re1+ 14. Bf1 and white is safe.} 12. d3 {But anyhow, I hadn't realised this at the time, so I prepared to develop my bishop.} Bg4 {Losing the bishop - I would have preferred Re8 preparing the discovered check 14. ... Bxh2+ winning the queen.} 13. f3 {To relieve a hole for my king and attacking the bishop.} Bf5 {He retreats.} 14. Qxe5 {Now I figured that I could take the bishop, as my king could escape to f2.} Rfe8 {Now the other bishop is lost, and there is no mate.} 15. Qxf5 Re1+ {Check, but a vain hope.} 16. Kf2 {Safe and sound.} Rae8 {Yes, this is what I feared - those doubled rooks look menacing on the e-file - nevertheless, e2 is covered by the knight. } 17. d4 {But I give it extra protection.} g6 {? Adding to the double bishops lost, a knight is now thrown in the bag.} 18. Qxf6 b5 {To be sincerely honest, this loses to a mate threat.} 19. Bh6 {Bh6! and black resigned here, seeing that there was no way to stop mate on g7. Well played perrinnn, and thanks for watching! @oodle3}
