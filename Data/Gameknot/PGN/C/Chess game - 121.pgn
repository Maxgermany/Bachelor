1. e4 d5 {The Scotch game} 2. exd5 {I accepted the gambit} Qxd5 {Principles violation: The black queen goes for a ride, before the minor pieces are developed. } 3. Nc3 {Develop a knight that threatens the black queen, gaining a tempo.} Qe5+ {Futile, it wont be another chance.} 4. Be2 {Protecting the King while developing the bishop.} b6 {Black is preparing a fianchetto, this seems a mistake, should he developed first either knight.} 5. d4 {I take the center with the queen pawn, giving freeway to the dark bishop, while attacking again the black queen, hence another tempo.} Qd6 6. Nf3 {Developing second knight, securing now e5} Bb7 {Black fianchetto is ready, but useless.} 7. Nb5 {Principles violation! Maybe I should castle before? I couldn't resist!} Qd8 {Queen's back home. Is important to protect c6 square preventing the nasty knight fork.} 8. Bf4 {I contine the development while pressing the c7 square.} a6 {Blunder!! Black needed to protect c7 with Na6 and not pushing the knight to where it hurts.} 9. Nxc7+ {Oops...} Kd7 {Black didn't have any better move, maybe Qxc7?} 10. Ne5+ {Check, and threatening another fork at f7. Knight are just beautiful.} Kxc7 {What else?} 11. Nxf7+ {Queen and Rook forked with discovered check. Black resigns.}
