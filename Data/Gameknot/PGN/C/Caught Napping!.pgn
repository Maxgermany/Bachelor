1. g3 {Hi everyone!  Has this ever happened to you?  You are a pawn up and about to exchange into an endgame.  You think you are winning but wham - your opponent really hits you with a whammy and it could be a double or a triple one.  Either way, it ends in a loss for you and worse your opponent's rating is south of you!  Well, could the ground please swallow me up here?  Anyhow, my opponent kicks off with 1. g3 and this transposes into the Benko Gambit.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 {2........ dxc4 - here I accept the gambit.} 3. Bg2 c6 {3. ...... c6 - taking the sting out of the white lsb's attack.} 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nbd7 6. O-O e5 {6. ...... e5 - a central pawn thrust.} 7. d3 cxd3 8. Qxd3 {8. Qxd3 - pawn trade - I get rid of my c doubleton for white's d pawn.  I therefore become a clear pawn up.} Qc7 9. e4 Bd6 10. b3 O-O {10. ....... 0-0 - I catch up on the development front by tucking Henry away on the kingside.} 11. Bb2 Re8 12. Rac1 Qb8 13. Nd2 Nf8 14. Nc4 Bc7 {14. ..... Bc7 - white has a more active position for his pawn.} 15. Ne2 Rd8 16. Qc2 Be6 17. Rcd1 Ng6 {17. ........ Ng6 - trying to improve the position of my steeds.} 18. h3 Rd7 19. Rxd7 Nxd7 {19. ...... Nxd7 - rook trade.} 20. Rd1 Qe8 21. g4 Rd8 {21. ....... Rd8 - contesting that d column.} 22. Ng3 Nb6 23. Ne3 {23. Ne3 - avoiding a knight trade.} Nc8 24. Nef5 f6 {24. ...... f6 - giving my e5 pawn more support, guess I should have swapped off Fou Leblanc for that horsie right now.} 25. Bc1 Rd7 26. Nh5 Bxf5 27. exf5 Nf8 28. Bh6 {26. Bh6!! - here is the stinger, why oh why did I not see it.  You see, if gxh6?? then Glenda falls to a Royal Forkie on f6, in fact it will be a family fork only I at least trade rooks first!} Rxd1+ 29. Qxd1 {29. Qxd1 - rook trade.} Qd8 30. Qxd8 Bxd8 {30. ...... Bxd8 - now the queen trade.} 31. Nxg7 {31. Nxg7 - I have to give my pawn back but the agony does not end there.} Nd7 32. Ne6 Be7 33. Bf1 {33. Bf1 - looks innocuous but it conceals a dastardly plan .......} Bd6 34. Nd8 {34. Nd8! - ..... it looks like I am about to lose a pawn ....} Nc5 {24 ....... Nc5 - I thought that this move would save my b pawn, but ........} 35. Bc4+ {35.  Bc4+!!! - ...... my opponent now reveals his dastardly plan, taking advantage of the fact that Henry is suddenly short of squares.  The only square available to him is h8.  Then that horrible horsie on d8 will go to f7 with check.  Henry must go to g8 and voila a discovery will lead to Fou Lenoir's demise for starties.  I therefore wave the white flag.  Sorry for the sour grapes but I do wish the ground would swallow me up here as I was well and truly caught napping.  Anyhow, Steve, take a bow.  If you play like this in other games then I see no reason why you should not have at least a 1700+ rating!  In the meantime I must get my brain into gear or I will lose all I worked for.  Anyhow, hope you have enjoyed your weekend - bye for now - Joanne}
