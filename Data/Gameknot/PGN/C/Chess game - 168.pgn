1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 {Thought I'd hold off on the Queens gambit.} 3. Bf4 e6 4. Bg5 c5 {Nows the time for the queens gambit.} 5. Bxf6 {Don't think there was any need for this as I can introduce my queen.} Qxf6 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. e3 Nc6 8. Nb5 O-O {Saw the check coming with the knight, so decided it was a good time to castle and get rook involved.} 9. c4 Rd8 10. Nc7 dxc4 11. Qa4 Qxb2 12. Qd1 {Waste of a move bringing the queen out and putting it back!} Bb4+ {He resigned here! He would have to Qd2, then I would take his queen with mine which would be checkmate.}
