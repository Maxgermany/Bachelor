1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. h3 {more popular variations are 6.Be2,Bc4 or Bg5.} b5 {very dangereous continuation , better was 6..Nc6 or 6...g6 .} 7. Nd5 {i think that Fischer wanted to attack the'' hole'' on c6 .} Bb7 {mistake: all black troubles started probably as the result of that bad move .  maybe if 7...Nxe4.8.Qf3-Nc5.9.Nf6+-gxf6.10.Qxa8-Bb7.11.Qa7-Qc7.12.b4-Ncd7. and black have good position for the quality he lost . there is another option :9.b4-e6.10.bxc5-exd5.11.Qxd5-Ra7 and equal position .} 8. Nxf6+ gxf6 9. c4 {good move , white must be aggressive or else he will lose his positional advantage , if white played a regular move like 9.Bd3 , so black would answered 9... Nd7 and everything fine for black. however what if 9...Bxe4.10.cxb5-Bg7.11.Qg4-Bg6.12.Nf5-0-0 , and uncleared position . or even  9...b4 . } bxc4 {9...Bxe4 was better move .} 10. Bxc4 Bxe4 11. O-O d5 12. Re1 e5 {maybe it was better for black to play 12...dxc4 however, after 13.Rxe4-Qd5.14.Qf3-e6, and white have advantage , now after 12...e5 white begins to attack with full power .} 13. Qa4+ Nd7 {if 13...Qd7.14.Bb5!-axb.15.Qxa8-Bd6.16.Rxe4!-dxe4.17.Qxe4-Nf5 and black under heavy attack .} 14. Rxe4 dxe4 {white sacrifiesing qaullity to open the diagonal a2-g8 and with the help of Nf5 blacks position all most pearliest . and if 14...dxc4 .15.Nf5 even worse for black because he have not material advantage , and the extra pawn is less important .} 15. Nf5 {not 15.Qb3-Qb6.16.Bxf7+-Kd7 and black have some chanses to be saved .} Bc5 16. Ng7+ Ke7 {not 16...Kf8.17.Bh6-Kg8.18.Qb3 with massive attack.} 17. Nf5+ Ke8 {the same position but the difrense is that black lost his casteling option for the rest of the game .} 18. Be3 Bxe3 19. fxe3 {the DSB exchange doesnt makes it easy for black , white threating Nd6+.} Qb6 20. Rd1 {white threats 21.Bxf7+-Kxf7.22.Qxd7+with deadly mate attack .} Ra7 21. Rd6 {not 21.Nd6+-Ke7 and black is saved .} Qd8 22. Qb3 Qc7 {black cant defend the f7 pawn because if 22...Rf8.23.Ng7+-Ke7.24.Qa3+and white win .} 23. Bxf7+ Kd8 { if 23...Kf8??.24.Bh5!and the black kings life going to end very soon .} 24. Be6 {black resignd. Naidorff doesnt want to  suffer any more . for exampele : if 24...Rb7.25.Qa4-Qc8.26.Qa5+-Ke8.27.Qxa6-Kd8.28.Bxd7-Rxd7.29.Rxd7+-Qxd7.30.Qxf6+Kc7Qxe5+Kb6.38.Qxh8 and win . thank you very much . hope you enjoyed the game .}
