[Opening "Hungarian defence (C50)"]

1. e4 {standard opening and most popular so far in my survey on my blog {see profile}} e5 {blocking and keeps the center deadlocked and for now closed} 2. Nf3 {yuck, i either need to not play e4 anymore or learn how to defend against this fun opening} Nc6 {ah.........i guess no latvian here} 3. Bc4 {bishop attack time to block with a hungarian defense} Be7 {yep hungarian} 4. Nc3 {here comes hungry knight} d6 {opening up my bishop on c8} 5. Ng5 {urk, as X machine put it later : what was I thinking?} Bxg5 {up a minor piece, my usual tactical awareness} 6. O-O {castling , getting safe probably a wise idea} Nf6 {out comes the knight so I can do the same} 7. h3 {pawn storm stops Bh3 possibility ice cold} O-O {time to copy here and become mr. copyCat} 8. Nd5 {outposter} Nxe4 {unfortunately pawnbuster just leapt into duty} 9. Re1 {attack!} Nf6 {retreat and attack for a trade} 10. Nxf6+ {trade,YES!} Bxf6 {deciding not to trap my bishop off on a desrted island} 11. d3 {developing a hopefully good potential attack} Bh4 {threatening Bxf2 after Qf6} 12. Bd2 {brining over for an attack or protection} Qf6 {going thorugh with the attack} 13. g3 {Now I'm not sure why he resigned here but probably because his castle is getting ripped to shreds. I of course got immediately rechallenged to a rematch, which I "definitely" deserved, sadly it ended similarly with a blunder. Good game, X-Machine I hope you get me good next time for the pain of these two losses. Until next time, Gator, when I'll have the 2nd game of our epicly sadly short series.}
