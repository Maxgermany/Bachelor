[Opening "Scotch (C45), Mieses variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {I have acquired a preference for scotch. The opening leads directly to assertive and open play, with juicy bits in waiting for the endgame. } exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {This is a very common and healthy response by black. } 5. Nxc6 {This leads the game into the Mieses variation. The alternative would be to support the knight in the center, which also leads to good play. I prefer to sustain the forward momentum. } bxc6 {The normal continuation ...} 6. e5 Qe7 7. Qe2 Nd5 8. c4 {All the previous moves are main line theory.} Nb6 9. b3 a5 {This is an interesting attack idea by black, putting pressure on the a and b files.} 10. Bb2 a4 11. Nd2 {This is a very dynamic square for the knight. } axb3 12. axb3 Rxa1+ 13. Bxa1 {So far the attack has only lead to exchange of rooks. The bishop is in the corner, but note that it controls the entire black diagonal! Moreover blacks king's position is now somewhat more awkward that that of the white king. } Qb4 14. Qd1 Be7 15. Bd3 O-O {I believe castelling was premature at this point. Black loses out on attacking chances, notably with the black bishop. } 16. O-O d6 17. Qc2 {This queen move is a key move. There is direct threat bearing down on h7, at the same time as the queen lends maximum support. } g6 18. Bc3 {This is the start of a whitch chase. } Qc5 19. Ne4 {Key position for the knight! The queen is dead already!} Qa3 20. Ra1 {Black cuts his losses ...} Qxa1+ 21. Bxa1 d5 {The bishops still exercise dangerous pressure, but there seems to be no easy way for black to get rid of them. } 22. Nf6+ Bxf6 23. exf6 {The leaves the pawn on an ideal square for mating by queen! Moreover it is difficult to attack, and holds the black pawns in place. } Re8 24. Qd2 {Aiming for h6, with mating threats. The rook is no real theat due to the bishop on d3 which can fall back to f1 if needed. } Kh8 25. Qh6 Rg8 {The correct moves for black here. } 26. cxd5 cxd5 27. Qc1 Re8 28. Bxg6 {Like my opponent realized, the bishop is poisoned!} Be6 29. Qh6 {Realizing that the game is over, black resigned!}
