1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 {White begins by announcing his desire to play a queen pawn opening but reserving a specific variation depending on how black develops..this could include a standard Queen's Gambit, Colle, or Catalan.} Nf6 3. e3 c5 {White aims for the Colle system and a slow methodical build-up of his forces} 4. c3 e6 5. Bd3 Nbd7 {Black's knight development on d7 instead of c6 will demand white to abandon the "Phoenix Attack" and pursue a different strategy to attack Black's position..Black's knight is less aggressively posted but more defensibly solid.} 6. Nbd2 Bd6 7. O-O O-O {White has completed standard Colle development and now must adjust his attack to black's development scheme.} 8. Re1 {Re1 is best here and signals white is ready to advance in the center...if black's knight were on c6, white would play dxc instead which is the Phoenix Attack.} Qc7 9. e4 {The standard method of attack in this position} cxd4 {Black decides to inflict an isolated pawn on white...but this is no problem as the pawn will not be weak} 10. cxd4 Nxe4 11. Nxe4 dxe4 12. Rxe4 {Black's strategy was to give white an isolated pawn after white played e4, but in this position white's pawn is not weak according to Koltanowski...the white rook looks vulnerable but is ready to switch to h4...typical attack in the ...Nbd7 variation} Re8 13. Be3 {white begins to target black's Queen and establish full development before attacking white's position.} Nf8 14. Rc1 Qe7 15. d5 {white opens more lines to aid in his attack} f5 16. Bg5 {white gains valuable tempos on black's queen and moves his forces closer for attack} Qf7 17. Ne5 Bxe5 18. Rxe5 Ng6 {A favorable simplification follows leaving white better} 19. dxe6 Bxe6 20. Rec5 {material is even but white has the two bishops and his forces are more harmonious} Rac8 {black seeks to exchange and relieve the pressure} 21. Rc5xc8 Rxc8 22. Rxc8+ Bxc8 23. b3 Ne5 24. Bb5 Bd7 25. Be2 {White refuses to exchange his two bishop advantage} Be6 {white now has a combination that targets black's weak queenside pawns or gains material} 26. Qd8+ Qf8 27. Qc7 {attacking both knight and pawn} Nf7 28. Be3 Qa8 {Black's Queen will never be able to aid in the coming escalation of force.} 29. Bf3 Nd8 30. Qe7 {Threatening mate} Bf7 31. Bd5 {Threatening mate again} g6 32. Bd4 {covering all escape squares} h5 33. Qe8+ {Black resigns as there is no defence}
