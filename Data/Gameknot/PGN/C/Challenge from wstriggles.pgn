1. d4 Nf6 2. d5 d6 3. c4 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. e4 Bg4 {White has more space here but black has further development 4 vs 2.} 7. Be2 c6 {hitting back at the center. if white takes, black gains another developing move.} 8. O-O cxd5 9. cxd5 Nbd7 {eyeing the e5 or c5 squares as an advanced point for the knight. The knight "hops on short legs"! the further they advance into enemy territory, the stronger they get!! also preparing Rc8 moving the rook to the open file.} 10. h3 {? I think this is the key move here. black wants to trade in order to gain the e5 square. also black gains a tempo if he captures on f3 due to the bad bishop position. perhaps Nd4 to prevent the trade. or even another idea of Be3 to develop and prevent Rc8.} Bxf3 11. Bxf3 {white has the two bishops, however the center is closed. if the knights can gain an advanced support point, they can be far superior to the bishops.} Rc8 12. Be2 {desperate to activate the bishop. perhaps Bg4  is better, trading the bad bishop for a knight.} Nc5 {advancing with tempo} 13. Qc2 a6 {very logical, this restricts both the light square bishop and the knight.} 14. Bg5 {The bishop develops!} b5 15. b3 {Black threats are just too many here.} Ncxe4 16. Bd2 Nxd2 {removing the defender of the knight.} 17. Qxd2 Rxc3 18. Qxc3 Nxd5 19. Qc6 Bxa1 20. Rxa1 Nb6 21. Rd1 Qb8 22. Rd4 Rc8 23. Qf3 Rc5 24. Rf4 Qe8 25. Qb7 Nd5 26. Rf3 Nc7 27. b4 Rc1+ 28.
