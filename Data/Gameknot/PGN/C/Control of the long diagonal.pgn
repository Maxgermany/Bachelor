1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Bd3 c6 4. f4 {White aggressive here, Black playing much more quietly.} Qa5+ 5. c3 Bg4 6. Nf3 {Two relatively cheap attacks that merely gave White excuses to develop, although there are two pins in place.} e6 7. e5 Nd5 {Good centrally-placed knight for Black. White has a decent pawn structure, but Black's position is probably more solid right now (although the queen's effectiveness is rather limited, and a move back to c7 or d8 might be best).} 8. h3 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 Nd7 {White forces the issue, although Black might have done better to improve his pawn structure (perhaps 9...g6 to set up a fianchetto and help weaken White's stronghold on the a1-h8 diagonal) or move his queen back and get her out of that rather stranded position.  Development of that knight further cramps the queen's prospects to be relevant if she is moved back..} 10. O-O Be7 11. Qe2 O-O {White really needs to develop his queenside. Black has a solid defensive position, although prospects for an attack are not too bright, and that stranded queen is still a worry.} 12. Bd2 f6 {How strong is White's center, Black asks?} 13. Na3 {Best move to make under the circumstances.  13. g3 might be OK, although the king would appear to have a vulnerable position in that circumstance, and this move keeps what White obviously feels to be a secure position while activating that last minor piece.} f5 {Gridlock.} 14. c4 Nb4 15. Bc3 {White's c3 bishop is very powerful, protecting the potentially weak b2 pawn, extending White's absolute dominance over the a1-h8 diagonal, and pinning the b4 knight to that queen.} d5 16. c5 {Not the best move as it looks like it could create something of a hole in White's formation, but White evidently is willing to risk that if given a piece in return.  He calculates that there is little to fear from Black's very defensive position here.} b6 17. cxb6 axb6 18. Qd2 {Not so much of a hole anymore - Black offered White a cheap escape route. White pumping up the pressure on that queen, figuring to remove Black's knight from the board and take advantage of White's now-vulnerable kingside. Probably loses him the knight as well but White is enjoying the initiative.} Qa7 {Really? Black essentially gives up any attack he had. Very bad move.} 19. Bxb4 Bh4 {Also bad. Allows White to execute the exchange and weaken Black's back line, all for a vague threat to White's kingside with no support.} 20. Bxf8 Rxf8 21. Kh2 Qb8 22. g3 {Nothing to fear now from Black. Right?} Be7 {The most sensible move. Black will try to regroup.} 23. Nc2 Qd8 24. Qc3 Qc7 25. b3 b5 {White doesn't appear to have any affirmative ideas and is trying to get Black to make moves and subsequently weaken its own structure.} 26. Nb4 c5 27. Na6 Qb6 {Na6 was a bad move, as a simple return to c2 would have been fine. Lost piece.} 28. Nxc5 Nxc5 29. dxc5 Bxc5 {Decent desperado to escape without any major loss. White's queen and bishop still shore up a solid formation. Black needs to get that rook involved to have any attack.} 30. Rac1 Rc8 31. b4 {Perhaps the biggest blunder of the match by White.} Bg1+ 32. Kg2 {Arguably even worse for overlooking Rxg1.} Rxc3 33. Rxc3 Bd4 34. Rc8+ {I still think White has a somewhat better position - in a game like this, with diagonals difficult to exploit due to the pawn structure, two rooks probably beats the queen - but that hurt.} Kf7 35. Rh8 h6 36. Rc8 Qa6 37. Rc2 Qa3 38. Bxb5 Qxb4 39. Bd3 Bc5 {White smart to stay on the light squares, but this position looks possibly like a draw waiting to happen. It's online chess between patzers, though, so we don't do that.} 40. Rfc1 Bd4 41. h4 h5 42. Kh3 {Decent protection of the king.} Kg6 43. Be2 Be3 44. Rd1 Qe4 {Vague pressure.} 45. Rc6 Kf7 46. Rc7+ Kf8 47. Rf1 Qa4 48. Bxh5 {Breakthrough.} Qxa2 49. Bf7 d4 {No other real alternatives - probably the only aggression possible.} 50. Bh5 d3 51. Bd1 d2 52. Rc2 Qb1 {Black can't break this position, but if White does anything dumb he probably loses.} 53. h5 Kg8 {53...Kf7 is better.} 54. Kh4 Kh7 55. Kg5 {It's probably over now.} Qc1 {Will White make one last mistake?} 56. Ra2 Qb1 57. Ra4 Qa2 {Seems mostly like a deliberate suicide move.} 58. Rxa2 {Resignation.}
