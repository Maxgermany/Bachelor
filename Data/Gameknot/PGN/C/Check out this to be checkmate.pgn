1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 {King's Indian Classical} e5 7. O-O exd4 {King's Indian exchange, which isn't common to most players. White or Black should know how to play this line. Take me for example, I lost a point in a OTB chess tournament once, and I've only played against it once in a tournament, because I was dumbfounded when an opponent decided to play this line; I was not ready and didn't even know what the lines were!} 8. Nxd4 a6 9. Be3 Nbd7 10. f3 {At this point I didn't know what he had in mind. I knew f3 was common in this line so I followed suite.} Nb6 11. Nc2 {Again, a common move to play in this line and I wanted to preserve the Knight.} c5 12. Qd2 Be6 13. b3 Qc7 14. g4 Nbd7 15. Bh6 {I wanted to traded bishops. Pawn-g5 would block my bishop and the diagonal.} Ne5 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. Ne3 {Controlling the d5-square.} Rab8 18. g5 Nh5 19. f4 {OH! Also, I wanted to play this move and w/o the Knight on e3, I wouldn't have been able to do so. Hence, the knight move on move 17.} Nc6 20. Bxh5 gxh5 21. f5 Bd7 22. f6+ {I thought this to be the best continuation as he's unable to move the Pawn-f7, forced to the back eighth row, and rooks remain out of play.  King-g6 seem suicidal } Kh8 23. Qe2 Rfg8 24. Qxh5 Rxg5+ {Oops!} 25. Qxg5 Rg8 26. Qxg8+ Kxg8 27. Ncd5 {Time to defend. This move blocks the Pawn-d, while attacking.} Qa5 28. Kh1 Kf8 29. Rfg1 Ne5 30. Rg7 {! and excellent move!!!} Qd2 {?} 31. Ne7 {!!! Black resigns.}
