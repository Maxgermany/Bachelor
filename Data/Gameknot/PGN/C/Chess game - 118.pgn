1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Spanish Opening} a6 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 Be7 {My opponents last move is unusual} 6. O-O {idea if 6..Nf6 7.Re1 In these lines of the Spanish white always castles kingside so might as well do it now as my opponent now needs to move. I will then be able to use this information to better place my pieces rather then trying to place it in a good spot now} d6 {threatening 7..Na5 winning the bishop pair} 7. c3 {creates a square for the bishop thus keeping bishop pair.Also controls d4 making a d4 advance possible later on} Nf6 {transposes to mainline Spanish} 8. Re1 {I always put my rook here although usually in a different move order} Bg4 {8..0-0 would be the mainline although the move played is logical. Since after 8..0-0 9.h3 and I will be able to get a d4 advance in one move. My opponents move discourages a d4 advance as my knight on f3 is pinned to queen} 9. d3 {Although 9.d4 is playable I prefer 9.d3 as now I will try to create a d4 advance slowly} h6 {Don't think that preventing 10.Bg5 with 9..h6 is good. My opponent has nothing to fear with 10.Bg5. 9..0-0 is much better } 10. Nbd2 {The knight would be poorly placed on 10.Na3, So I reposition it it via f1. The knight will end up on e3 or g3. The choice usually depends on what my opponent does. This f1 maneuver is typical in this variation of Spanish opening} O-O {good move safeguards king} 11. Nf1 {continuing my knight maneuver} a5 {Don't like this. My opponent should be developing.The move in question also takes away protection of the b5 pawn. 11..Re8 instead} 12. Ne3 {Decided that this square is better than g3 as the knight attacks the bishop on g4 which will have to move otherwise I get the bishop pair} Qd7 {This just seems to loss the bishop pair as I can't see anyway of my opponent taking advantage of his lead in development} 13. Nxg4 Nxg4 14. h3 {This move is bad. Although the knight is stopping the DSB getting to e3, it's not controlling the center well.My move just forces it to a good square} Nf6 {Only available safe square, albeit a good square for a knight} 15. a4 {my LSB is well place on b3, 15.a4 stops 15..a4 by my opponent} b4 {I did think he had to play 15..bxa4 so this came as a surprise} 16. cxb4 Nxb4 17. d4 {Although my opponent has a knight outpost , the knight isn't attacking any key points, where as I'm about to open the position.Bishop pair needs open position} exd4 {Don't know it this is a good or bad move.} 18. Qxd4 {there is a downfall to my opponents last move that the queen has a good center square now} c5 {looks positional suspect. That backward pawn on d6 looks bad} 19. Qc4 {this keeps pressure on the d5 square and gives my queen a close square to the center square} Qc7 20. Bd2 Qb6 21. Bc3 {puts my DSB on a good square and now I'm catching up in development. My opponent needed to develop rooks} Qa6 22. Qxa6 Rxa6 {I don't mind queens coming off as I'm not planning on attacking his king. With this position, I feel my opponents pieces are dis-coordinated} 23. e5 {I think my pieces are more coordinate so I start with play in the center} Nfd5 24. Rad1 Nc7 {My opponent couldn't play 24..Nxc3 25.bxc3 Nc6 26.exd6 wins a pawn for me and I'm more developed} 25. Bc4 Rb6 {My opponent rook must stay and protect the pawn} 26. exd6 Bxd6 27. Ne5 Bxe5 {My opponent had to take the knight as 27.Nd7 winning the exchange and 27..Rd8 28.Nxf7 is crushing and 27..Rb7 28.Rxd6 a piece up} 28. Bxe5 Nca6 29. Rd7 Nb8 {losing move. The combination that happens wins two pawns of me} 30. Bxb8 {idea is to clear the route of the rook on e1 to e7} Rbxb8 31. Ree7 {two rooks on the seventh.Not surprising that this combination wins} Nc6 {my opponent attacks pawn b2 and rook e7} 32. Rexf7 {I'm threatening 33.Rxg7+ Kh8 34.Rh7# if 32..Rfe8 33.Rxg7+ Kf8 34.Rg8# if 32..Rfe8 33.Rxg7+ Kh8 34.Rh7# same combination works if rook on e.d. or c file it 32..Kh8 33.Rxg7 and nothing stops 34.Rh7#} Rxf7 33. Rxf7 Kh8 {if 33..Rxb2 34.Rb7+ Kh8 35.Rxb2 if 33..Rf8 34.Rc7+ Kh8 35.Rxc6 if 33..Rc8 34.Rc7+ Kh8 35.Rxc8 if 33..Nd8 34.Rb7+ 35.Rxb8} 34. Rc7 {Skewering knight and pawn} Nd4 35. b3 Nxb3 36. Bxb3 Rxb3 37. Rxc5 {two pawns up} Kh7 38. Rxa5 Ra3 {still two pawns up} 39. Ra6 {my opponent king can't go to g6} h5 40. h4 {not sure why I played 40.h4} Ra2 41. f3 Ra3 42. Kh2 Ra2 {I'm struggling to find a plan} 43. Kh3 Ra3 44. a5 {Now I figure get my a pawn to a7 with the rook on a8 and it will be close to promotion} Ra4 45. Ra8 Ra3 46. a6 Ra2 47. a7 {Now that my pawn is close to promotion my opponent can't take the kingside pawns with his rook else I play Rb8 and promote the a pawn} Kg6 48. g4 hxg4+ {My opponent must play this. If 48..Ra3 49.gxh5 Kxh5 50. Rh8+ Kg6 51 a8=Q} 49. Kxg4 Rg2+ 50. Kf4 Ra2 51. h5+ Kh7 {My opponent can't take the pawn as 51.Kxh5 52.Rh8+ Kg6 53.a8=Q} 52. Ke5 Ra5+ 53. Ke6 Ra6+ 54. Ke7 {54.Kf7 doesn't work since 54.Kf7 Ra4 55.f4 Rxf4+ its check so my opponent can return to the a file without me promoting} Ra3 55. f4 Ra5 56. f5 {My opponent still can't take else I promote} Ra6 57. h6 gxh6 {now f6 pawn will promote} 58. f6 Ra1 59. f7 Re1+ 60. Kd6 Rd1+ 61. Kc5 {Any comments greatly appreciated.Thank you to chudasyc for a good game}
