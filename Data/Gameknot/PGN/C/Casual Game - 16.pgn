1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {The French Defense, which can leave Black with good prospects if played well, or a horribly cramped game if, as in this case, it is played badly.} 3. Nc3 dxe4 {Giving up the center too easily.} 4. Nxe4 Bd6 {I prefer a developmental system of B-K2, N-KB3 and O-O for Black in this position. Followed up by N-Q2 so as to recapture on KB3 with a Knight, this system keeps Black's King safe.} 5. Bd3 Ne7 {Weakening. The natural spot for the N is KB3, especially if K-side castling is in the works. it provides much better defense from KB3.} 6. Bg5 {White exploits the weakend Black K-side with a pin.} O-O {If Black's B were on K2 and his N on KB3, this move would be acceptable. Instead, White rips away Black's flimsy defenses.} 7. Nf6+ {If Black tries 7... K-R1 here, 8 Q-R5! is a deadly stroke. Note that if Black's N were at KB3, White would have to exchange off his own N to get ...Q-R5 in.} gxf6 8. Bxf6 {The King-hunt begins. Black is in dire straits.} Qd7 {Black prepares to guard 9 Q-N4 ch with 9...N-N3. But...} 9. Bxh7+ {There is no defense. Mate is now forced.} Kxh7 10. Qh5+ {As is so often the case, this move is deadly.} Kg8 11. Qh8# {A beautiful attack, forced through elegantly by White.}
