1. d4 c6 2. e4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bc8 6. Bc4 Nf6 {Non-standard.  Black should try to either block or attack the bishop, with e6 or b5, although this does develop the knight.} 7. Nf3 {Preparing to castle, with knights doubled king-side.} Bg4 {Pins the knight, looking to capture and double White's KBP.} 8. h3 Bxf3 9. gxf3 {Why not Qxf3?  The doubled pawn is weak.} e6 10. Bg5 Nbd7 {Rather than bring the Queen out early, Black chooses to reinforce with a knight.  Be7 is perhaps stronger, as it allows Black to castle.} 11. Ne4 {White strengthens his attack; the knight is pinned.} Be7 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nd6+ {Temporarily wins a pawn.} Ke7 14. Nxb7 Qb6 15. Nc5 Nxc5 16. dxc5 Qb4+ {Unnecessary, but a check often causes mistakes.} 17. c3 Qxc5 {The temptation is to take the Bishop, but that leaves 18. Qd6  open to White.  White gets two pawns for his Bishop and can seize the d-file.  It might not work, but Black would prefer to avoid the possibility.} 18. Bb3 Qe5+ 19. Qe2 Rhd8 20. Qxe5 Bxe5 21. O-O {So far, Black is simplifying to take advantage of the doubled pawn.  Although Black has an isolated QBP, the disadvantages should at worst cancel.  White connects his rooks, and attempts to secure his King.} Rd2 22. Rab1 Bc7 23. Kg2 Rad8 24. Bc4 f5 25. Rfe1 Rd8d6 26. b4 Bb6 27. Re2 Rxe2 {Winning a pawn.} 28. Bxe2 Rd2 29. Kf1 Rxa2 30. Bc4 Rxf2+ {And another one.} 31. Ke1 Rxf3 32. Kd2 Be3+ 33. Kc2 Rxh3 34. Re1 e5 35. Re2 f4 36. Rg2 Rg3 37. Re2 Rf3 38. Kd3 {Four pawns up, Black wants the Rooks off the board.} Rf2 39. Rxf2 {And White obliges.} Bxf2 {For Black, it should now merely be a matter of pushing pawns up the board.} 40. Ke4 Kf6 41. Ba6 g5 42. Bb7 g4 43. Bxc6 {With the pawn advantage, Black is willing to sacrifice the Bishop if necessary to prevent the White pawns from Queening, rather than waste a move trying to save the pawn.} g3 44. Kf3 Kg5 45. c4 Kh4 46. Kg2 Kg5 47. Bf3 Kf5 48. c5 e4 49. Bd1 f3+ {Pushing the King back.} 50. Kf1 g2+ {A potentially fatal mistake.  After 51. Kxf2 Kf4, 52. Bxf3 ensures that Black is unable to Queen either pawn before White can Queen the c pawn.  Much better is 50. ... Kf4.  Then if 51. Bxf3, Kxf3 52. c6 g2#; or if 51. c6, e3 52. c7 g2# (52. Bxf3 Kfx3 53. c7 g2# lasts one more move).} 51. Kxf2 Kf4 52. c6 {However, White advances the c pawn prematurely, sealing his own fate.} e3+ 53. Kg1 {53. Ke1 loses as follows: 53. ... f2  54. Ke2 f1=Q#.} Kg3 54. c7 {54. Bxf3 Kxf3 holds longer.  Play then could proceed 55. c7 e2 56. c8=Q e1=Q  57. Kh2  Qh1#.  If 55. Kh2, e2 56. c7 e1=Q  57. c8=Q Qh1# (on 56. Kh3, g1=Q with mate next move).} f2# {}
