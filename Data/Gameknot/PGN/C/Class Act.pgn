[Opening "QGD (D51), 4.Bg5 Nbd7"]

1. d4 {I have always been interested in my rating, never having had one, but as near as I can say I play at the level of 1600-1800 in gameknot points.  So I opened with D4, thinking to play solidly against my opponent.} d5 2. c4 {I have been playing the Queen's gambit more often in blitz.  Player's do not appear to be accepting the gambit, though.} e6 {I think this is the Slav variation of the QGD.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {And I don't know what this position is called, although I would be curious.} 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. a3 {Everything appears to be proceeding normally so far.  This a3 break is a little out of the ordinary, but I did want motility of the c3 knight.} h6 6. Bh4 c5 {And black lashes out.  The position is still probably theoretical, and I defend modestly with e3.} 7. e3 Be7 {Seemingly passive.  I would imagine the usual continuation for black would be cxd.} 8. Bxf6 {I often prefer knights to bishops, but I did not have any very concrete reason for taking on f6.} Nxf6 9. Nf3 b6 10. cxd5 {I wanted to clarify the position so I could get a better look at it.  One possibility here is that black will be saddled with floating pawns on c5 and d5.  Cxd also opened up the possibility of bishop b5+, although in this position it does not appear advantageous. } exd5 11. Ne5 {With this move I finally signal aggressive intentions.  At the moment there is the threat of bishop b5+, followed perhaps by nc6.  I was curious to see how black would respond to this sudden escalation.  } Bb7 {An apparent mistake.  Protecting against nc6, but weakening the crucial d7 square, which is now put under pressure.} 12. Bb5+ Kf8 {This move is virtually forced after black's mistaken bishop b7.  White has a definite advantage in this position, and I studied the board for a while, sensing that it was crucial to maintain the developing attack.} 13. Qc2 {I remember being a bit disappointed in myself when I played the prosaic Qc2.  I just could not see anything clearer in the position.} Rc8 {With obvious threats of cd.  Again I contemplate the board, looking for a strong, attacking move.} 14. h4 {I don't know if this is that good.  It doesn't seem terrible, with ideas of rh3 followed by the crude rg3 or rf3.  I also had the idea of sacking a knight with ng6+ followed by h5+ and qg6+.  But this seemed arrogant and uncertain.  H4 was a safer bet and probably a better try.} cxd4 15. exd4 a6 {I consider this move and the following to be germane for white's position.  } 16. Ba4 b5 17. Bb3 b4 {This looks like it is going to be a problem.  I had to play very accurately.} 18. axb4 Bxb4 {I can sometimes analyze tactical positions well, as I did here, but I must admit that when I get tired, tactical analysis is one of the first parts of my game to fail.} 19. Rc1 Ne4 20. Qe2 {Maybe qd3 was better.  This move lets me pressure g7, however.} Nxc3 21. bxc3 Rxc3 22. Rxc3 Bxc3+ 23. Kf1 {White is down by a pawn in this simplified ending.  I think black stands better here with the two bishops.  } Kg8 {I think this move is far to passive.  It may even be loosing.  I am able to threaten the crushing qxf7+ after I move, and black's bishop was become a tactical liability.} 24. Qf3 Qe7 {Where qc7 maintains black's advantage.} 25. Qxc3 Kh7 26. Bc2+ g6 27. h5 {White is completely winning.} Rc8 28. hxg6+ Kg7 29. Qg3 f6 30. Qh4 {Threatening the crushing qxh6+.} Rb8 {Black is loosing anyway.} 31. Qxh6+ {And here he just resigned.}
