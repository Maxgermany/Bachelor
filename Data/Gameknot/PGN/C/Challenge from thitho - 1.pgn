1. Nf3 {Reti} d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 {back to english} e6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 {I see no reason to dislike this situation. On the contrary: I open the queen side and keep an average center.} dxc4 7. Qa4+ Bd7 8. Qxc4 {recuperating the pawn... without the bishop.} Bc6 9. e3 {expose the possibility of Bxf3 and disabling the castling, but I guess black was not very open to the possibility of a second opened colum, right on the king side.} O-O 10. Be2 Nbd7 11. O-O {both camp castled... White has to concentrate the battle on the queen side. } Qe7 12. Qb4 {the idea was double: or you change, and I reconstruct my pawns line (which happened), or you go away and lose a tempo.} Qxb4 {change} 13. axb4 a6 {seems obvious... though this will lead to gain.} 14. Bb2 {preventing Ne4? Yes, but mostly preparing the rooks doubling on a column} Rfe8 {... haven't seen the plan.} 15. Ra5 {starting the progression. I am not sure black saw the coupled possibility of b4-b5 with the bishop e2 and the two rooks before the next move.} Ne4 {this move, though apparently placing a good knight, has no perspective: c3 and d2 are protected.} 16. Rfa1 {now, if b5, axb loses a rook and Bxb5, Bxb5 axb too. So the main perspective here is to lose a pawn... } Nb6 {but black wants to preserve the pawn by giving the possibility to play axb.} 17. c4 {well, then, we are going to get more soldiers.. on b5?} h6 18. c5 {NO! we eliminate a defensor.} Nd5 19. b5 {and here is the combination previously announced.} Bd7 {so, just potentially loses a pawn.} 20. bxa6 bxa6 21. Ne5 {before taking the pawn, white viewed other advantage: as we are three on the pawn, we can allow ourselves to double the attack with this centralized knight. As black moves' Nd2 is without consequence, we can liberate our f3-defender and make him attack the bishop} Nef6 {unexpected, but wise: the e4 knight was not useful: here he protects our target. } 22. Bxa6 {let's take the treasure.} Reb8 {yes, that was the threat of course! But it was also foreseen by white.} 23. Bc1 {replacing: there is no rush on the a-column.} Be8 {? to prevent something I have no idea of.} 24. Kf1 {still no rush, let's avoid an eventual corridor mate.} Ne4 {i guess he wanted to prevent Bd2, or to assure c3 and b4 for both horses.} 25. c6 {blocking the bishop and announcing Bb7.} Nb4 {well, the bishop was already with his voucher for b7, so...} 26. Bb7 {provoking some exchanges} Rxa5 27. Rxa5 Rd8 {i guess to prevent Nd7 - Bxd7 - cxd7 and then Bc8 which would be dramatic. But instead black loses its only threat to b1... on the other hand, with b7 and b4 occupied, there was no more threat for a good while...} 28. Ra8 {the rooks have played their role: now they only can expose white to a counter-attack. that is why I forced the exchange here.} Rxa8 29. Bxa8 {Isn't this position already a winner?} Nf6 {prohibiting white horse to go to d7. It was not the plan actually. I planned to play Ba3, then, after the expected Na6 or Nc2 to play Be7, or even after Nfd5, to play Nd7, then} 30. Bd2 {faster, now, because i can plan to go on a5. target is c7} Nbd5 31. Ba5 Kf8 32. Ke2 Ng8 {unexpected, and losing faster, because the main protector of d7 is now exposed to...} 33. e4 Nb6 34. Bxb6 cxb6 {"i'm free, i'm free!"} 35. c7 Ne7 {I was thinking of 35 ... Bb5+ 36. Ke3 Ba6 37 Nd7+, taking the pawn... this solution is not better.} 36. d5 {preparing the last charge.} Bb5+ {forced} 37. Ke3 Ba6 {Too soon! It had to play first Ke7} 38. d6 {Now, Nc8 39 d7 is winning. there is no better option... black resigns.}
