1. e3 e6 {Fairly standered openings from both sides.} 2. Bb5 c6 {Not quite sure what he was trying to do with the bishop... but I threatened it anyway.} 3. Be2 g6 {He retreated the bishop, this pawn formation is not one of my best, restricting several pieces.} 4. d3 Nf6 {Bringing the knight into play.} 5. Bf3 Bb4+ {Putting him under pressure - trying to throw him off balance.} 6. Bd2 Be7 {Expected defensive response, piece moved to safety.} 7. Bc3 Nh5 {Knight moved further out - offering knight for bishop.} 8. Bxh8 {Stupid move. He takes my rook.} Bb4+ 9. Bc3 {Forcing the bishop away from my back line.} Bd6 {Moving to target h2, if he castles, I can checkmate with my queen on that square.} 10. Ne2 {Moved knight out of the way, looks like he's going to castle, which is exactly what I want.} Qh4 {Queen moved to threaten h2 - he will have nothing covering it if he castles so my quuen bishop will mate his king.} 11. O-O {He castles...} Qxh2# {...and the trap is sprung.}
