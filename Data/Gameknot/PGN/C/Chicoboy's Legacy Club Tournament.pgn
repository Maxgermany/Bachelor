1. e4 {As I know, Ron also likes the KPO, the best.} e5 {Joann, however, veries between this and the Sicilian Defense.  But, she similar to me because, if not for that defense, she'll allow the Ruy Lopez.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Not surprised to see Joann play this.  In fact, this is how I would've responded because when Ron to the most common square, and then Joann reattacks (forcing white's LSB to b3) she will have a pawn chain, which is useful in the opening.  That is the big picture here, at least, in my opinion, based on what I learned from Susan Polgar in a video with a very different defense, however.  Nonetheless, it still applies here.} 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 Na5 {In this position, black intends to trade Ron's LSB for her N.  It all has to do with good and bad bishops.  The idea being is that white's LSB is his good bishop because it's not blocked by pawns, whereas, his DSB is the bad bishop.  So, by exchanging, she's eliminating her bad bishop for the one that's worth more.  Just before this happens, however, white is going to do what I'd play.  And, that is, get his K to safety.} 6. O-O Nxb3 7. axb3 d6 {Not only developing a center pawn, but preparing to get her LSB into play, in such a way, that she doesn't have to fianchetto it.  In addition, Joann has another solid pawn chain, with this move.} 8. d4 {I think, I would've played 8.d3, but given this move, there's more to a story then meets the eye.  Ron want's to exchange pawns.  I understand that because it would, generally, be my goal.  But, there is a bigger picture to this, as Jack once said which is, "why go into complications."} f6 {With that being said, however, Joann prevents the exchange, at all costs.} 9. c4 {Trying to undouble his pawns.  This time, I have no idea why because, according to tactical-abyss, doubled pawns are usually of no asset, unless, major pieces have been exchanged.  So, there's got to be a big picture that I am, somehow, missing.  I think that his plan was to get the N to a3, and once you exchange, that piece is suddenly better place which would, however, make sense to me.  The idea in terms of strategy and improving your position, well one step is, finding a good outpost for your Knight.} b4 {Of course, black won't allow that.  And, not does she prevent the exchange, but it will be more difficult for Ron to find a good outpost for his N on b1.} 10. Be3 {Meanwhile, he waists no time in bringing another piece into play.} Bb7 {Given that she played 7...d6, I anticipated Joann pinning his N with 10...Bg4  But, instead, she forms the longest diagonal for her B.  Personally, I like the structure better here.  That is especially because white isn't just attacking e4.  But, that pressure involves a center pawn, which is the big picture.} 11. d5 {Protecting his d pawn, and turning, what was the bad Bishop, into, the good one.  In doing so, Ron is strengthening his position, which I like.} c5 {This time, I have no idea why Joann played this, as opposed to, 11...c6  But, either way, an exchange is going to ensue.} 12. dxc6 e.p. Bxc6 13. Nbd2 {Developing his final piece.  The only issue is that, with no better outposts for the N, Ron's Q is sort of limited by his piece, so we are experiencing a little bit of interference.  That's why I allude to when calling it an uncomfortable position.  But, as we know, anything can happen.} Qd7 {Black is threatening to do something here.  My guess, seeing what happened with some of my recent losses, is the threat of ...Qg4, and then follows ...Bc8, with the idea of, in addition, the long term plan of getting the N from g8 to g6, and possibly to h4.  So, her Q, LSB, and N, would all pose as a nasty threat.  Therefore, something has to be done about the threat.} 14. Ne1 {And, Ron finds the answer, as now, her Q cannot land on g4, which would've been the cornerstone to the problem.} Qb7 {I believe that the idea here is putting pressure on b6.} 15. Nd3 {But, Ron fires back with his own attack.} a5 {Protecting b4 and getting a nice pawn chain, in the process.} 16. Qf3 {Adding another defender to e4.} Ne7 {Getting the N out.  And, I think that Joann intends to bring it to g6.} 17. Qh3 {? I am not sure why Ron played this.  But, I think that it's a mistake.  With this move, Joann will win a pawn.  Instead, I would've left the Q there and added, yet, another defender by bringing one of the R's to e1, which also happens to attack the center.} Bxe4 18. Nxe4 Qxe4 19. Rfd1 {Protecting the N.  And, with that being said, this is also what I would've played.} Qf5 {In this position, Joann intends to trade Q's.} 20. g4 {But, Ron does not allow it.  Instead, he goes on the offense.  I am not exactly sure why, as I would've exchanged.  The idea being that, in general, when you're ahead, it's to your benefit to liquidate pieces.  Therefore, my hypothesis, seeing what Jack taught last week, is that white's Q is stronger then black's Q.} Qc8 21. Qg2 {I am not sure why Ron played this, but my guess would be to support his isolated pawns.  The idea being that a piece between them, is almost, as good as, pawns that are not isolated.} Ng6 {? Joann finds a better outpost for her N.  The only problem is that Ron will win back pawn.  That's because after 22.Nxb4, black dare not take back because of 23.Rxa8, winning a R, in which she would not be able to recapture then, as that would mean losing the Q.  Instead, I would've brought my R or Q to the b file. } 22. Nxb4 Be7 {So, Joann decides to complete development, instead which will allow her to castle.} 23. Nd5 {Not only going after the B, but Ron intends to win a R by forking on b6.} Ra6 {Of course, Joann will not allow that.} 24. b4 {Intending to exchange with the idea being to eliminate the doubled pawns.} O-O {Instead, Joann castles.  I understand why she did this, but the only problem is that Ron will get a passed pawn with his next move.  To add insult to injury, it will involve a more dangerous set of pawn chains.  Best was, therefore, 24...axb4, in my opinion.  In addition, this move is going to lose material, as we're about to see.} 25. b5 Ra8 {Protecting her R.  But, the only issue is that Ron can and will get that nasty fork.  In doing, so she will face ruinous loss of material.  The real story, however, is that there was no way to protect the Rook, no matter what she did.} 26. Nb6 Qd8 27. Qd5+ {Instead of taking, right away, Ron delivers a nasty check.  I like this better because, when Joann gets out, white will further liquidate pieces, after winning material (a R for N).} Kh8 28. Qxa8 Qxa8 29. Nxa8 Rxa8 30. b6 {As they say, "Passed pawns must be pushed."} Nf8 {Unlike before, I do not know why Joann played this.} 31. Rd5 {It is a different story with Ron, however.  The reason why he played this was to bring his R behind the passer.  As Jack Stockel and GM Susan Polgar have emphasized, one should bring his or her R behind a passed pawn.  That way, it has protection, and if you're able to promote it would, at the very least, mean win material.  Even if it can't Queen, it makes the passer much more dangerous.} a4 {Meanwhile, Joann's plan is to get a passed pawn.  The idea is going for a swindle and hoping that white would make a mistake because doing so could, in theory, give the opponent a passer.  I mean, as he told me in one of my previous annotations, all one can do is hope the opponent will go wrong.  That was, when I had two Q's against him, and used that with a R to force a win.  In fact, that was my first win against redfoxrising, but he, at one point, hoped I'd go wrong which I came close to doing.  And, if I did, he would've mated me right away, in what was, a lost position.} 32. Rb5 {As noted a move earlier, Ron now has a R behind his passed pawn. With that being said, black is in a lot of trouble, at this point.} Nd7 {Nonetheless, she keeps fighting which is what I would've done, in this position.} 33. b7 {Continuing to push his passed pawn.} Re8 {? Protecting her R, but I think this is a mistake.  In my opinion, better was 33...Ra7, as not only can't the pawn promote (due to her N), but a4 is protected.  With this move, however, Joann will lose, yet, another pawn.  And, now, it's safe to infer that game is hopelessly lost for black.  In other words, I don't think that Joann can save this game (hold on) any longer.} 34. Rxa4 Kg8 {I am not sure why Joann played this.  But, that doesn't matter as it isn't the picture.  No matter what she plays, Ron will force a win.} 35. Ra8 {Not only is Ron going to promote, but in doing so black will, at best, will continue liquidating before winning a piece, in addition, to what white has won.  A sample line is 35...Rb8 36.Rxb8+, Nxb8 37.Ba7, Nc6 38.b8=Q+, Nxb8 39.Rxb8+  As a result, Joann resigned. }
