1. c4 {He starts out with the english opening} e5 2. Nc3 c6 {I commonly only bring it up 1, to save room for my bishop, on a long range attack} 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 h5 {I open up a wall for my stubby henchmen} 5. Nf3 {Fiencetto, I see the move very commonly} Bh6 6. Nxe5 {He takes advantage of my unprotected pawn. An issue for me is that I get like 3-5 pawns behind, and that hurts me in the end game with chances of promotion with my opponent} Qf6 7. Nf3 Na6 8. O-O Ne7 9. d3 {so, he looks over at my bishop} Bxc1 10. Rxc1 d6 11. a3 Be6 12. b4 c5 13. Ne4 Qb2 {I came in the hole and it gave me an advantage} 14. Nxd6+ {We both get a good advantage, but who's is better?} Kf8 15. Nxb7 cxb4 16. axb4 Qxb4 17. Rb1 Qc3 18. Nd6 {a better move would have been Rb3, leaving me with 2 spaces-f6, and g7} Bg4 19. Ne5 Qxe5 {I looka t this move happily, seeing a fork on his rook and queen} 20. Bxa8 Qxd6 {I was mad at myself for not taking the obvious, and taking back what I rightfully owned} 21. Bg2 Qe5 {I wasted moves going for a seccond attempt, now that I see how he can avoid that} 22. Re1 Kg7 23. h3 Bf5 24. Qa4 Rb8 25. Qxa6 Rxb1 26. Rxb1 Qxe2 {Ha Ha!} 27. Bf1 {here's were we take action} Qf3 28. Qd6 Nc6 29. Qd5 {"Ok Fiona, if you insist."} Qxd5 30. cxd5 Nd4 31. d6 {Going for promotion} Nf3+ 32. Kg2 Nd2 33. Rb7 a5 34. d7 Bxd7 {You tried} 35.
