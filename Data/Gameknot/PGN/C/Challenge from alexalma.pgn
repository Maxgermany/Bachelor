1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 {i almost always open d4-c4 as white} d6 {normal moves} 3. Nc3 {develop} Nbd7 {develop, locking in his bishop unless he goes to b7} 4. Nf3 {developing knights first} e5 {attacking the center} 5. d5 {trying to take space} Be7 {developing} 6. e4 {creating a pawn structure} O-O {castling} 7. Bd3 {developing to defend the pawns again} c6 {probably hoping I take} 8. Bg5 {developing my final piece} cxd5 9. cxd5 {fine pawn strucutre still for me but} Nxd5 {brilliant tactic by him to win a pawn. I believe that there is nothing I could have done; as I analyzed many lines; correct me if i'm wrong} 10. Nxd5 Bxg5 {I wanted my knight at d5 which is the reason I took there} 11. Qc2 {attacking c7 I guess} Nc5 {blocking me} 12. O-O {I castle } Bh6 {he retreats, favoring a bishop over a knight. That spot would be a strong spot for his bishop never allowing me to bring my rooks to c1 during the game on to the open final} 13. b4 {attacking his knight} Nxd3 14. Qxd3 {uggh im down a pawn and have a knight pair rather than a bishop pair so im down around 1.5 points} Be6 15. Qb5 {threatening b7} Qd7 {he defends and offers a trade} 16. Qd3 {i reject} Rac8 17. Nd2 {I try and bring my knight to attack the pawns} Bxd5 18. Qxd5 {he gives up the bishop pair} Qc6 19. Nb3 {he offers another trade} Qxd5 20. exd5 {still down a pawn} Rc4 {attacks my pawn} 21. a3 {i defend} b6 {i really want to get to c1 but I cant} 22. Rfd1 {i defend the center pawn} Rfc8 {he doubles his rooks} 23. g3 {i forget why I played this, maybe so i can get my rook on d1 off the back rank} a6 {he pushes his pawn} 24. Kg2 {? i move my king, maybe i didnt want any forced trades as im down a pawn and want to make it complicated} f5 {he pushes the pawn} 25. Nd2 {I attack his rook} Rd4 {he attacks my pawn} 26. Nf3 {i attack the rook again} Rxd1 {he trades} 27. Rxd1 Rc3 {he attacks} 28. Ra1 Rd3 {i defend} 29. Nh4 {I lose another pawn but attack f5 hoping he doesnt see it} g6 {of course he does} 30. Ra2 {I want to get onto the c column} Rxd5 31. Rc2 {i do} Rd3 {he attacks my pawn} 32. Rc6 {i attack two of his} Rxa3 {he takes} 33. Rxd6 b5 {now after all the pawn takes im down two pawns in what seems to be a lost end game} 34. Nxf5 {yes one pawn back with this supposed tactic but...} Bf8 {great move I didnt see and now I am really done} 35. Rf6 gxf5 36. Rxf5 {I am down a whole piece now} Bxb4 37. Rxe5 {he takes, i take we both have passed pawns} Bf8 38. Rg5+ {I check} Bg7 39. h4 {I must push} h6 40. Rg6 Kh7 41. Rb6 {I get behind his pawns making it difficult} Ra4 {he starts to push} 42. f4 {i push as well} b4 43. Kf3 {I try and get my king into the action} Ra3+ {he checks and will push again} 44. Ke4 b3 45. f5 {I push} Bf8 {he avoids Rb7 a5 f6} 46. Rb7+ {I check and begin to come up with a strategy to lock  the king on the last row. if he played bg7 then f6} Kg8 47. Ke5 {I move the king forward and a plan really starts to come together} a5 {he pushes } 48. Kf6 a4 {he pushes} 49. Kg6 {I get opposition and see a small glimmer of hope} Ra2 {He must've seen my idea but believed he would be okay} 50. f6 {I push again} b2 {he pushes as well} 51. Rb8 {! only one move can save him} b1=Q+ {! Noooo he finds it. I must take} 52. Rxb1 Rg2 {best move} 53. f7+ {f7+!! best move for me; pretty much forces a draw froma position that should be lost and in fact it gains me the win as he resigns} Kh8 {only move and he resigns mistakenly. I would have played Rb8 but after Rxg3+ Kf6 Rf3+ he can get three move repetition. Please comment any observations and whether or not he should have resigned.}
