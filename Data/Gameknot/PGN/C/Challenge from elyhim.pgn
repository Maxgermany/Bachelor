1. d4 {I would like to congratulate Russ20124 on an excellent game played. Russ20124 wanted to learn more about playing Queen pawn games and there is no better way to do that but to challenge an expert in the field. Russ20124 does well until he goes off the beaten trail and finds himself in serious trouble. However, Elyhim passes him a get out of jail card and the game continues. It is not until Russ20124 fails to see a tactic that he falls to the sword. } Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nd2 {An interesting approach to playing the queen pawn system. It is my opinion that the knight is much better on c3 where it has greater control over what happens in the center. Also it does not block the DSB which in this game never leaves home base. The lesson to learn here is to always play the optimal move that gives your pieces their greatest scope. In the openning phase development should be your #1 priority. } d5 {setting up the standard Queen pawn structure for black. It challenges for control of the center as well as frees the DSB for active duty. } 4. Ngf3 c5 {From black's perspective this known as the Semi-Tarrassh setup where black mirrors white pawns on d4 and c4. The plan for black is to develop his bishops on d6 and d7 with a knights on f6 and c6. As for the queen she is the most flexible which is able to go to e7, c7 or even b6 and a5 if the situation requires it. } 5. cxd5 {I would have played 5. e3 defending c4 and opening lanes for the LSB. Here white violates one of the cardinal rules of chess. Which is do not engage in the center until most of your pieces are developed. As opening the center usually benefits the one with the edge in development. } cxd4 {One of the hallmarks of master level play is to develop as the expense of your opponent. Here white is forced to recapture on d4 with his knight at which point black can develop his queen to the powerful d5 square threatening to capture on d4. This leaves black with the greatest control of the center which is a prelude to successful attack. When defending it is imperative to maintain the balance in the center. What I mean by this is to keep it closed and pawn structures should mirror each other. } 6. Nxd4 Qxd5 7. e3 {good move, supporting the knight in the center. } Bd7 {no point in challenging the knight as white can simply exchange on c6 and sattle black with a weak pawn on c6 } 8. Bc4 {opps! big mistake. White is trying to develop and attack the black queen at the same time which in theory is a good idea. However, the problem is that it drops the pawn on g2!. So black should simple play 8. ...Qxg2 and the game is over. White should have done is play 8. N4f3 Be7 9. Bc4 and white is A okay} Qa5 {cutting white some slack} 9. O-O {white wisely deals with his kings safety as a storm is starting brew} Nc6 10. Nd2b3 {!? not a bad move as it clears the road for white's DSB, attacks the black queen and supports d4. However, the threat is on d4 and by adopting a indirect defense requires considerable skill and technique. What I mean is to keep things simple and play smart moves. Here I would have played the simple 10. N4f3 Be7 11. B3 with a small advantage for white. While being to cute, the other drawbacks of Nb3 is that the knight is out of play and hangs the bishop on c4} Qc7 11. Nb5 {harassing the queen but for what! Now white has two knights on the b-file. Best was 11.N4f3} Qb8 {The queen most likely does not want to be here but the benefit is that after ...a6 ...b7-b5 is well prepared  } 12. Nc3 {I remarked during the game that this knight stack can be very powerful. However, the closer they are to the center the better. } a6 {planing b7-b5} 13. a4 {!? not a blunder but an inaccuracy the problem with this move is that it considerably weakens white's queen side specifically b4. Best is 13. e4 followed by Be2. } Nb4 14. f3 {?! This is a mistake, this is common at russ20124's rating level. By that I mean playing pawns in front of your castled king. Best was 14. Be2} Bd6 {A simple tactic of attacking h2. } 15. e4 {I think russ20124 missed the point of ...Bd6! } Bxh2+ 16. Kh1 Qg3 {Threatening mate via the move order 17...Qh4 and 18...Bg3+} 17. Qe1 {I like this move as white seeks to exchange queens to eliminate the mate threat. However, the attacker should always avoid such exchanges as exchanges usually benefit the defender.  } Qc7 18. Qe2 {This is a bas square for the queen to be sitting on as it can be forked by a knight on g3 which is exactly what I plan to do. } Nh5 {going to g3 and white can not stop me} 19. Qf2 {avoids the fork but the king is trapped in the corner. The next move forces white to trade his queen for the knight} Ng3+ 20. Qxg3 Bxg3 {now the mate in 3 threat exists via the move order 21. ...Qf4 22...Qh5+ 23...Qh2++} 21. Nd2 {White could have held on longer with Ne2 but that prolongs the agony} Qf4 22. Nb3 {This makes it mate in 3 but the best if you can call it that is 22. Rf2 which is mate in 8} Qh4+ 23. Kg1 Qh2# {Thank you for the game Russ20124}
