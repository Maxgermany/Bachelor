1. d4 {Moving out my pawn} e6 {Black moves out the pawn} 2. Nf3 {Moving out the knight} Na6 {Not a good move for Black; better to do Nc6 instead.} 3. Nc3 {Moving out my knight} b6 {Black probably wants to do Bb7 with this move.} 4. e3 {Protecting my pawn} Nb4 {Black moves his knight forward} 5. a3 {Threatening the knight} Nc6 {Moving the knight out of the way} 6. Bb5 {Threatening the knight} Nb8 {Instead of doing this move to keep the knight safe, it might have been better to do Ne7. } 7. Bd2 {Preparing to move out my bishop.} a5 {Black moves out the pawn. If I were in this position, I would have moved it to a6 instead to force me to move the bishop.} 8. Ne5 {Moving the knight forward} Nf6 {Black moves out the knight} 9. O-O {Castling} Nd5 {Moving the knight out} 10. Nxd5 {I take the knight} exd5 {Black responds} 11. Bc3 {Moving out my bishop} Bd6 {Black moves the bishop, threatening the knight} 12. b4 {Moving out my pawn. Looking back, this probably wasn't the smartest move; now my bishop has limited options.} axb4 {Black captures my pawn} 13. axb4 {I take Black's pawn} Rxa1 {Black takes my rook} 14. Qxa1 {I respond} c6 {Threatening my bishop} 15. Bd3 {Moving it out of danger} f6 {Threatening my knight} 16. Nf3 {Moving it out of danger} c5 {Battle of the Pawns.} 17. Qa8 {Threatening pawn on d5. } Na6 {Black moves the knight, although it wasn't in any danger because the bishop protected it. } 18. Bxa6 {I take the knight} Bxa6 {Black responds} 19. Qxa6 {I take the bishop} Ke7 {I can't seem to figure out why Black made this move. If I were Black, I'd have done cxb4 instead. That way, I'd either have to leave it as-is or else take the pawn, in which case Black could easily capture my bishop with his own.} 20. bxc5 {I prevent Black from seeing that move} bxc5 {Black responds} 21. dxc5 {I take the pawn} Bb8 {There was no reason for Black not to take my pawn; it was completely unprotected. } 22. Bb4 {Protecting my pawn} g5 {Black moves out the pawn} 23. c6+ {Putting the king in check} Kf7 {Moving out of check} 24. cxd7 {Taking the pawn} Qxd7 {Black responds} 25. Rd1 {Threatening the pawn on d5.} Rc8 {Black threatens my pawn} 26. Qd3 {Protecting the pawn} Qb7 {Black moves the queen to threaten my bishop} 27. Qxd5+ {Taking the pawn and checking the king} Qxd5 {Queen captures} 28. Rxd5 {I respond} Rxc2 {Black takes my pawn} 29. Rd7+ {Checking the king} Kg6 {Moving out of check} 30. Rb7 {Threatening the bishop} Rc1+ {Checking my king} 31. Be1 {Protecting the king} Bd6 {Moving the bishop out of danger} 32. Kf1 {Preparing to move my king out so I can use my bishop again} Bb4 {Threatening the bishop} 33. Ke2 {Not the best move; now that I think about it, I should have done Rxb4 instead.} g4 {Threatening my knight} 34. Nh4+ {Checking the king} Kh6 {Moving out of check} 35. Rxb4 {I see the move I should have made several turns ago} Rc2+ {Checking the king} 36. Bd2 {Protecting the king} Kh5 {Threatening my knight} 37. Nf5 {Moving out of danger} Kg5 {Threatening my knight again} 38. e4+ {Protecting the knight and checking the king} Kg6 {Moving out of check} 39. Rd4 {Protecting the bishop} Ra2 {I really don't know why Black did this. If I was in this situation, I'd instead do h5 to provide some extra protection to that g-pawn} 40. f3 {Threatening the g pawn} g3 {Ignore me, will you?} 41. hxg3 {Taking the pawn} Ra1 {Considering I now have a three move checkmate, I would have perhaps done Ra6 to prevent it.} 42. Nh4+ {Checking the king} Kh5 {Moving out of check} 43. Rd5+ {Checking the king again} f5 {Only move} 44. Rxf5# {Mate.}
