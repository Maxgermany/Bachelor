Material is even, and Black has an advantage in development but an exposed King position.} 9. O-O dxc5 10. Qe2 {I prepare to thrust forward in the center...} Bd6 11. f4 Kf7 12. e5 {...and I do, with a fork to boot.} Nd4 13. Qc4+ Ne6 14. exd6 {The dust has settled on the first skirmish...} Qxd6 15. Nc3 {...and I'm one Pawn ahead.} Rhe8 16. f5 {Black's pinned Knight is a sitting duck.} Re7 17. fxe6+ {Now I'm a piece up and Black's other Knight is also pinned.} Rxe6 18. Bg5 {Adding more pressure to the pin.} Rae8 19. Ne4 {Taking advantage of the fact that Black's Rook on K3 is also pinned, I add yet more pressure to the Knight.} Qd4+ 20.

Nd5+ {Instead, he lets the Knight loose.} Ke8 23. Rae1 {Yet another pin! [Sensing a theme here?] Black is compelled to exchange a pair of Rooks to avoid further material loss.} Rxe1 24. Rxe1+ {Now it's just a matter of mopping up.} Kd7 25. Nb4 {To guard the QBP, and clear the rank for my Rook.} Kc7 26. Re5 {Seizing the rank, and threatening to eliminate Black's last piece with 27 R-B5 ch.} Kb6 27. Rd5 {A waiting move.} Rc4 28. c3 {Guards the Knight.} dxc3 29. bxc3 {Black's advanced Pawn is now eliminated.} Rxc3 30. Bd8+ {Black's only legal move, 30... R-B2, would lose the Rook to 31 BxR. Black resigns.}
