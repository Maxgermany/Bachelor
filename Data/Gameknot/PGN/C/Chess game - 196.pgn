1. d4 c6 2. e3 Nf6 3. c4 Qa5+ 4. Bd2 Qb6 5. Nf3 Ne4 6. c5 Qc7 7. Ne5 f6 8. Nc4 Na6 9. Ba5 Qb8 {pushing the queen into the back row is a moral victory, if nothing else} 10. Ncd2 d5 11. Nc3 {not I did not enpassent, or however its spelled. I want that queen trapped, and right now, she's stuck.} Bf5 12. Qf3 Nxd2 13. Qxf5 Nxf1 14. Rxf1 g6 {some trades just happened and the queen remains trapped. this player was in a bad spot right about now.} 15. Qf3 Bg7 16. e4 Nc7 17. Bxc7 Qxc7 18. exd5 Qa5 {watch this.} 19. dxc6 {up two, and time to completely dominate the board} bxc6 20. Qxc6+ {OUCH.} Kf8 {??????????????????????????????!!!?!?????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!} 21. Qxa8+ Kf7 22. Qd5+ {up 7} e6 {saw that coming.} 23. Qd7+ {see?} Kg8 24. Qxe6+ Kf8 25. Qc8+ Qd8 {this was an honest mistake on his part, and it ate up 30 seconds on my clock trying to figure out his devious scheme. I found none so i took the queen.} 26. Qxd8+ {ok, at this point he forfeits, so this is just how I imagine the game would've gone.} Kf7 27. Qd7+ Kg8 28. Nd5 h5 29. Qe6+ Kh7 30. Nxf6+ Kh6 31. Ng8+ Kh7 32. Qf7 g5 33. Nf6+ Kh6 34. Nxh5 Bxd4 35. Rd1 Bxb2 36. Rd6+ Bf6 37. Rxf6# {a good game, but it was just me assuming what they would do. I probably made some mistakes along the way for this person's moves after 26, but it was obvious I was going to win this game}
