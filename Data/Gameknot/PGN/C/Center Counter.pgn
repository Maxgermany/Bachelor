1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 {Very typical so far.  White wants to castle Queen side as soon as possible. } 4. Bc4 c6 5. d4 Nf6 6. Bd2 Qc7 {Just basic development.  White is avoiding Nf3 so that black can't play Bg4 with a pin. } 7. Qe2 Bg4 8. f3 {White will still be able to develop his knight to good effect and black is starting to lag behind in development. } Bh5 9. O-O-O e6 {Is black thinking of castling king side?  9. .., N(b)d7 followed by O-O-O would have been better. } 10. Nh3 Nbd7 11. Nf4 Bg6 {White has a surprise.  Do you see it?  White's lead in development should translate to a tactical move. } 12. Bxe6 {If 12. ..., fxe6, then 13. Nxe6 and the queen is attacked at the same time white threatens 14. Nc7 dbk check which gains the rook.  On 13. Nxe6, Qb8, ( on Qc8, 14. Nxg7dbl ck, Kd8, 15.  Ne6 ck, Ke8 or Ke7 and white still has the discovery ) 14. Nc7 dbl ck, Kd8, 15. Nxa8, Qxa8,  Material maybe close to even but Black's king is still the center and white can push d5 to try and open things up. } O-O-O 13. Nxg6 {Threatens the rook so that black has to capture the knight. } fxg6 14. g3 Bd6 {White was going to play Bf4 so black prevents it. } 15. Ne4 {To prevent white from taking the bishop on d6 he must play 15. ..., Rhe8 } Kb8 16. Nxd6 {After 16. ..., Qxd6 then Bf4 wins the Queen so black resigns.  I hope you enjoy the game please comment if you see improvements. }
