[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 {This was a close tactical game involving the Advance Variation of the Caro Kann. Although it was decided by a mistake, it is of some interest for me to analyse some of the departures from theory in the late opening and the complicated position that arose in the middle game.} c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {The Caro Advance.} Bf5 {Black gets his bishop outside his pawn skeleton - the main point in playing the Caro Kann.} 4. Nc3 {Preparing to go into to the aggressive Bayonnet Variation after 4 ...e6, 5. g4!? A quieter alternative, quite popular nowadays, is Short's 4. Nf3.} Qb6 {The main alternative to 4. ...e6. Black opts to steer the game into other channels.} 5. Bd3 Bxd3 6. Qxd3 e6 7. Nge2 {The usual deployment for the KN, though it has its pros and cons.} Ne7 8. O-O Nd7 9. a4 {Aiming to gain a little space on the queenside at the expense of the black queen.} a6 {An important move, given that black plans ...c5. A white knight landing on b5 would be very problematic.} 10. Qh3 {Again a thematic move in this variation. The queen exerts pressure on the kingside and especially e6.} Nf5 {The optimal posting for the knight - the question is whether it is premature.} 11. a5 Qc7 {This seems to be a popular move, though the theory I know says ...Qd8. The present move gives good support to the centre, but excludes the option of challenging the white queen on h4.} 12. g4 {Theory, as far as I know, has Nd1 at this point, preparing to break open the centre with c4. I won with that in another annotated game (vs caimig), but was a bit unconvinced by it, and opted for this aggressive lunge instead. Strategically the idea is similar, to take advantage of black's slow and slightly cramped development.} Ne7 13. Be3 {Preparing to meet black's counter-attack in the centre. I am relying on this bishop to hold things together while I prepare to advance the f-pawn.} c5 {The thematic counter-attack.} 14. f4 cxd4 15. Nxd4 {Putting pressure on f5 and e6.} Nc6 {Preparing to exchange off the white knight as well as threatening the a-pawn.} 16. f5 Nxd4 {Black decides that the knight has to go.} 17. Bxd4 Bc5 18. Ne2 {Now the other knight will come to d4, where it in turn holds the white position together.} Bxd4+ 19. Nxd4 Qxe5 {My plan here was to attack the e-file. First however I have to protect the knight.} 20. Rad1 O-O {Getting the king out of the way, though surprisingly it is not as safe there as it looks.} 21. Rfe1 Qf6 {Black takes the f-file as compensation, anticipating the exchange of f-pawns.} 22. fxe6 fxe6 23. Nxe6 Qf2+ {This turns out to be not as dangerous as it looks. } 24. Kh1 Rf3 25. Qh5 Nf6 26. Qg5 {A naive-looking attempt which proves surprisingly difficult to stop.} g6 27. Qh6 Ne8 28. Ng5 Re3 {Black miscalculates here. On the other hand ...Rf7 is impossible, and ...Nf6 lets the rook through to e7.} 29. Qxh7+ Kf8 30. Ref1 {And 0-1.}
