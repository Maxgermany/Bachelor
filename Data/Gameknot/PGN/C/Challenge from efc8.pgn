1. e4 c5 {E4 my favorite opening move. c5 attacks d4 & Nf3 protects  } 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Nc6 adding more pressure to d4. Not too worried about that at this time so I will develop Bc4 aiming at f7} 3. Bc4 e6 {e6 opens diagonals for the Q & B. I think it's best to castle now.} 4. O-O Bd6 {Bd6 aims at h2 protected by K & N. It is time to get back to protect d4 with c3 keeping the N at bay} 5. c3 h6 {Not too sure why h6 and not developing the N preparing for castling} 6. d4 {With 3 pieces covering d4 against 2 pieces it is a good time to play d4 opening the c1 h6 diagonal } Nf6 7. d5 {Nf6 attacks e4, but d5 pushes the N backwards. ed is met with ed and opens the e file} exd5 8. exd5 Ne7 9. Nbd2 {With black reversing his N I develop mine Nd2} a6 {a6 preparing to drive the B away. Not in any danger, I move Re1 to controls the e file. } 10. Re1 O-O 11. Ne4 {Black castles and Ne4 attacks the B & N. Not wanting to lose the Bishop or N x N opening the King's defense, Black's N x N and R takes N } Nxe4 12. Rxe4 b5 {b5 attacks the B which reverses to b3} 13. Bb3 c4 {c4 joins the attack and Bishop settles on c2} 14. Bc2 Ng6 {Ng6 clears the file for a fight so I strengthen the rear with Re1} 15. Re1 Ne5 {Ne5 is a mistake, it loses a piece to White and maybe the game also. N xN} 16. Nxe5 Qc7 {Qc7 doubles the attack on h2 hence N retreats to f3 to protect h2} 17. Nf3 Bb7 18. Be4 {Bb7 eyes the p at d5 so the Bishop protects at e4} f5 19. Bc2 {f5 forces the Bishop to c2} Rf6 20. Be3 {Not too sure of black's plan with the Rf6, I finally develop the Bishop at e3 } f4 {The f4 attack on the Bishop could be another mistake, it blocks the double attack on h2. the Bishop then attacks the R at f6 by going to d4.} 21. Bd4 Rf7 {The R retreats leaving Pawn at d5 unprotected and having control of e5 decided to trade Bishops} 22. Be5 Bxe5 23. Rxe5 {B x B R x B instead of N x B keeping P fixed at f4} Qc5 {Qc5 focus on f2 could have driven the Q with d6 but have to protect  Nf3 so B is added to defend d5} 24. Be4 Raf8 25. d6 {With Rooks doubled protecting f4 I decided to attack Q with R and B with B pushing p d6} Qc8 26. Bxb7 Qxb7 {Q retreats to c8  B X B got rid of the attacker of Nf3} 27. Qe2 Qb8 {Qe2 makes room for rear R move & supports Re5} 28. Rd1 {Qb8 attacks d6 & Rd1 protects} Rf7f6 29. Red5 {Rf6 double attack d6 & Re5 to d5 secures d6} Re8 30. Qc2 {Re8 attacks Q and is moved to control b1-h7 diagonal on c2 } Rfe6 31. h3 {Rf6-e6 doubles on the e file preparing to attack Q. It seems I need an escape for the K with h3} Re6e2 32. Rd1d2 {Re2 is met with Rd1- d2} Re2e4 {R retreats e4 supporting pf4} 33. Qd1 {R blocks diagonal Q is on so Qd1guards Nf3 & falls behind the Rook pair} Re8e6 {Not sure what Re8 - e6 can do but with a piece up it seems a good time to begin trading pieces - Rd4} 34. Rd5d4 {Not sure } Qb7 {Qb2 double protect e4 but as I said it's trading time R x R Q x R} 35. Rxe4 Qxe4 36. Rd4 {Rd4 attacks Q} Qb7 {Q retreats to b7} 37. Rxf4 {R x f4} Rg6 {Rg6 is met with Rg4 for the trade.} 38. Rg4 Re6 39. Qd4 {Re6 avoids the trade & Qd4 threatens checkmate} g5 40. h4 {g5 blocks checkmate & h4 is played to weaken g5} Rg6 {Rg6 is played to support g5 but is driven away with h5} 41. h5 Re6 {Re6 is met with Nh4 } 42. Nh4 Qc8 43. Ng6 Qe8 {With the pawn pinned Q e8 doubles for attack on K. Ng6 is brought forward in the attack} 44. Ne7+ {Ne7 + Kh7 Qd5 prepares check K with Qf5} Kh7 45. Qd5 Qf7 {Qf7 can be met with Qf5 forcing the Q exchange but prefer pinning Rook with Re4 } 46. Re4 Qf6 {Qf6 R x R continues the exchange} 47. Rxe6 {If Q x R    Q x Q and pd7 head for promotion.} dxe6 48. Qb7 {If de Qb7} Qf7 {Qf7 trying to defend the K  Qe4+} 49. Qe4+ {The K has two squares to go now. If Kg7 then  Qg6+ Q x Q    N x Q} Kg7 50. Qg6+ Qxg6 51. Nxg6 {}
