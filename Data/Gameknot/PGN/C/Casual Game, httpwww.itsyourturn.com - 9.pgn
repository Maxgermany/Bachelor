1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. d4 Nf6 5. g3 {Having an extra opening for the bishop is really unnecessary. } Nc6 {More usual for me would be Bd6. } 6. c3 { } Bd6 7. Bg5 {This costs valuable time when white needs to castle. } O-O 8. Bg2 Re8+ 9. Be3 Ng4 10. Qd2 Nxe3 11. fxe3 {This backward pawn will be white's undoing.} Ne7 {Obviously better than Na5 12. b3. } 12. O-O Nf5 13. Re1 h5 {Since Black's pieces are aimed toward the kingside, this makes sense. } 14. Qd3 c5 {14. ... h4 is also good.  15. g4 h3  16. Bxh3 Nh4 with threats and complications.  17. Nxh4?? Qxh4 forks two pieces.  18. e4 dxe4 19. Rxe4 Rxe4 20. Qxe4 Qh4 with powerful threats. } 15. c4 {A tactical blunder. } dxc4 {Now white should try to hang on with Qd2. } 16. Qxc4 {Qd2 was better.} Nxe3 17. Qe2 {17. Qc3  is just slightly better because black would like to be able to play cxd4 followed by Bc5.} Bd7 {Bf5, Bg4 and cxd4 are also good. } 18. Nc3 {This is the wrong square because after cxd4 threatening the knight, white's options are more limited.  Nbd2 is better. } cxd4 19. Nxd4 Bc5 {Suddenly things are horrid for white.  Now 20. Nb3?? Nxg2+ 21. Kxg2 Bc6+.  If instead 21. Nxc5  Rxe2  22. Rxe2 Qb6 will eventually win because the pins and material advantage. } 20. Qd3 {20. Qd2 doesn't seem to be any better after Nxg2. } Nxg2 {Now if 21. Kxg2 Bc6+ 22. Kf1 Qd7! puts white in a world of hurt.} 21. Rxe8+ Bxe8 22. Kxg2 {22. Nce2 might prolong the agony longer. } Bc6+ 23. Ne4 Qxd4 24. Qxd4 Bxd4 25. Kf3 {If 25. Re1 then Re8.} Re8 {}
