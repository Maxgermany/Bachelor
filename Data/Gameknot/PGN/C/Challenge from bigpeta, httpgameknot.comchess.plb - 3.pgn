1. d4 Nf6 2. f3 {Would be interested to know the reasoning for this weak move standard is Nf3 or c4 } d5 3. c4 {And now one of the cruelties of chess. What was correct last move is wrong this move!! Either Nc3 or having gone with f3 continue with e4 } c5 4. dxc5 {taking this way gives up the centre to white. better was cxd5 } e5 {slightly better for me was e6 protecting d5 } 5. b4 {too many pawn moves without developing your pieces cxd5 undoubles your pawns } a5 6. Qa4+ {It is no use attacking with oe piece which can easily be defended. again cxd5 was correct } Bd7 7. b5 Bxc5 8. cxd5 {what was the correct move now becomes the game losing move. It allows Bd4 threatening to win the R Better was to withdraw the Q to c2 for defensive purposes } Bd4 9. Qxd4 {And now to give up your Q to save a R is game over } exd4 10. e4 dxe3 e.p. 11.
