1. e4 {Here starts the great match (the 4th one, but still) between me, and Utku, or goflb, as his nick goes.} c5 2. c3 {Denying the Sicilian Defence's more aggressive variants is both unexpected, and little known by many players, so here it goes.} Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 cxd4 5. cxd4 Nc6 6. f4 d6 7. Nf3 Bg4 8. Nc3 {A blunder by white, trying to attack when not everything is defended.} dxe5 {And here starts the punishing period of it.} 9. fxe5 e6 {An unexpected defence maneuver that lets me defend more, but I choose unwisely, and try to break the pin...} 10. Be2 Bb4 {Another pin, this time more deadly.} 11. Bd2 {Trying to break it, but is no use.} Bxf3 12. Bxf3 {Have to take it back with bishop if I'm to stay in the game...} Qh4+ 13. g3 Qxd4 14. Nxd5 {I'm trying to play with a single lost pawn here.} Qxe5+ {But he gets greedy, and wasted the match with a single blunder. Ouch.} 15. Kf2 {The knight is un-takeable, for the pin by rook on queen is deadly.} Bc5+ 16. Ne3 {Oops, the knight has escaped, now black has little chance, or does he?} O-O-O 17. Bxc6 {A pin most unwanted costs white a queen, but with attack on it's back too.} Bxe3+ 18. Bxe3 {Brave sacrifice of the queen, as the king will be in too bad of a position to be defended, with the h8 rook sitting still.} Rxd1 19. Bxb7+ {Getting a pawn and destroying the pawn structure, and the defense.} Kxb7 20. Raxd1 {Wrong rook, but still...} Qxb2+ {Greed hurts, he's leaving his queen even more open to the attacks by rooks, and leaving his queen in crossfire.} 21. Kf3 {Uncheckable place that doesn't block the rooks, perfect.} Kc7 {Biggest blunder in the match, unfixable too, ...Ka8 would play longer, and possibly win too.} 22. Rdc1+ {Punishment delivered before too late, black loses a queen or a rook.} Kd7 23. Rhd1+ Ke7 24. Rc7+ {And here comes the deadly maneuver, the killing blow.} Kf6 25. Bd4+ {Check, and queen is dead.}
