1. e4 {He opens the game} Nf6 {And I respond.} 2. e5 {I hate it when this happens; it's so annoying. >.<} Ng8 {Moving my knight out of harm's way} 3. d4 {Protecting his pawn} d6 {Get ready for the battle of the pawns.} 4. Nf3 {Moving his knight out.} dxe5 {Taking his pawn} 5. Nxe5 {He responds} Nf6 {Now I can take my knight out again.} 6. h3 {Who knows what he's doing here? Not me, that's for sure.} e6 {Opening a path for my DSB.} 7. c3 {Another pawn move, effectively cancelling anything I could do with my DSB.} Nc6 {Knight comes out} 8. Qa4 {Threatening my knight, eh? It won't be that easy, you know!} Bd7 {Protecting my king and knight.} 9. Nxc6 {He takes my knight} Bxc6 {And I respond; my bishop now threatens his queen and is protected by my b-pawn. I was surprised by what he did next.} 10. Bb5 {He threatens my bishop with his own} Qd6 {Further protecting my bishop} 11. O-O {He castles} Be7 {Moving my bishop out} 12. Be3 {Moving his bishop out} Nd5 {Aiming for his DSB.} 13. Bxc6+ {He takes my bishop} bxc6 {And I respond.} 14. Na3 {Not the best move; perhaps it would have been better to do Nd2.} Nxe3 {Taking his bishop in order to lessen the pawn defense around his king} 15. fxe3 {He responds} Qd7 {I try a little ploy with my queen; at the very least, we can trade queens and I won't have to worry about his anymore. I didn't even realize that he could have made a crucial mistake here, which he did.} 16. Nc4 {I have no idea what he's doing with that knight; perhaps he wants to bring it into our little struggle over here.} c5 {I move my pawn up one to open a path to his queen} 17. Ne5 {This was a big mistake on his part; better to move pawn to b3 or else move the queen.} Qxa4 {Now he lost his queen without me having to sacrifice mine.} 18. dxc5 {He takes my open pawn.} Qe4 {Aiming for the pawn on e3, but I failed to see what he would do with that pesky knight of his.} 19. Nxf7 {He takes my pawn and my king can't respond} Rf8 {Moving my rook out of danger} 20. Nd6+ {Not the best move.} cxd6 {Now I get his knight.} 21. cxd6 {He takes my pawn} Bxd6 {I take his pawn} 22. Rxf8+ {He takes my rook} Kxf8 {I respond.} 23. Kh1 {I seriously don't know what this move was about.} Qxe3 {I take the pawn that I wanted a few turns ago.} 24. Rf1+ {He tries to put my king in check.} Bf4 {Protecting my king} 25. b3 {Moving his pawn} Rc8 {Trying to take his other pawns} 26. c4 {Protecting the pawn} Rc5 {I decide to bring my rook into the action} 27. Rf3 {Threatening both my queen and bishop at once} Qe1+ {And he resigned after this move. }
