1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I was so relieved to be playing another game with Coach Ion after he was involved in the Christchurch Earthquake.  This game is part of a MT to commemorate players caught up in the Japanese Earthquake.  Back to our game, however, it seems the same old story.  Jo gets a reasonable game until late into the middlegame against the Experts and Masters and then passivitis sets in.  Coach Ion inflicted that ailment on me all right.  To see how, just play this through and look at the Gameknot Analysis link which is as follows:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15586699&rnd=0.7010855109933332} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {3. Bb5 - I will see how Ion copes with The Spanish Torture.} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 {5. ...... Be7 - a typically closed Lopez.} 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. a4 {8. a4 - an attempt to break up black's queenside pawns but it does not wash.  This move was recommended in the World DB but it does have the drawback of leaving that pawn out on a limb which is what happens in this game.} b4 9. d3 d6 10. a5 {10. a5 - puts a little cramp on black's queenside but see my earlier note.} Be6 11. Nbd2 Qc8 12. Bc4 Re8 13. b3 {13. b3 - considering a possible fianchetto for Fou Lenoir on b2.} d5 {13. ..... d5!? - interesting move, this will lead to a combo where I will win(?) a pawn, but hand Ion a positional edge.  Ion soon shows me which is better!} 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. Nxe5 Nxe5 16. Bxd5 Bxd5 17. Rxe5 {17. Rxe5 - what a stouche, and it ain't finished yet!} Bf6 18. Rxe8+ Qxe8 19. Rb1 {19. Rb1 - in having to evade Ion's dsb my advanced a5 pawn becomes a target.} Qc6 20. f3 {20. f3 - would Nf3 been an improvement?} Re8 21. Bb2 Qc5+ 22. Kf1 Bxb2 23. Rxb2 {26. Rxb2 - Ion's dangerous bishop is off the board and I lose Fou Lenoir, but also my extra pawn on a5, sigh!} Qxa5 24. Rb1 Qb6 25. Ne4 {25. Ne4 - trying to improve the position of my steed and to block out the e8 rook.  Trouble is, Ion has an f pawn to assail it!} f5 26. Ng3 Qh6 27. Kg1 {27. Kg1 - Henry must go back to g1 to protect the h2 pawn.} Qe3+ 28. Kh1 Qf2 29. Rc1 Re3 {29. ..... Re3 - suddenly Henry is starting to feel a little cold.  Hello, is that chessic Grim Reaper, Old Matey, coming to pay him a visit?  We shall soon see.} 30. Qg1 {30. Qg1 - well, Henry will soon feel nice and warm again cos his other half, Glenda is doing her usual defensive duties, but this time a little snuggle up is in order - now everyone say aaaah!} Rxf3 {30. ...... Rxf3!! - aaah but, Glenda cannot prevent Coach Ion from carrying out some dirty work at the crossroads.  He robs me of a pawn in broad daylight.  I realise to my horror that it is the pawn I must deliver or Henry loses his life.  If I play PXR it is #3.  Can you see the mate?} 31. Rf1 {31.  Rf1 - now a castle joins the little party on the kingside.  It really is getting very cosy for Henry, maybe a little claustrophobic methinks.} Qxg1+ 32. Kxg1 Rxf1+ 33. Kxf1 {33. Kxf1 - Coach Ion is very willing to exchange down into an endgame knowing my partiality for this.  But as you will see, it will be on his terms and that bodes ill for me.} g6 34. Ne2 c6 35. Kf2 Kf7 36. g3 {36. g3 - I would just lurve to get Henry out into the middle to try and block out Ion's king and obtain counterplay but first I must move as many pawns as possible onto dark squares.  However, as Ion pointed out during the game, his prelate will be a monster piece in this endgame and my knight will be no match for it whatsoever, boy was he right!} Kf6 37. Ke3 g5 38. d4 {38. d4 - to hold back a move such as Ke5.} a5 39. Nc1 Be4 40. Kd2 {40. Kd2 - Henry is forced back to defend my c pawn.} f4 41. gxf4 gxf4 42. Ne2 Kf5 43. c4 {43. c4 - two trades of pawns have and will take place but they will not help me, particularly as Coach Ion now gets a very dangerous passer on the f column.  After one more move I decided that I would not be able to prevent Ion from crowning the f pawn without giving up my knight and there is always that h pawn.  Well played, Ion - Joanne} bxc3 e.p.+ 44.
