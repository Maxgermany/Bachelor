1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 {We play the Fried Liver game. My opponent accepts it.} 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7. Qf3+ {Threatening to take the knight back.} Qf6 {My opponent lets me take the knight back, not wanting to get into a difficult position.} 8. Bxd5+ {I take the knight first.} Be6 9. Bxe6+ Kxe6 10. Qxf6+ gxf6 {Tons of exchanges. I find myself up a pawn, but with a less-developed position. My pawns, however, are more together.} 11. Nc3 {I decide to develop my knight.} Bb4 {My opponent instantly attacks it.} 12. d3 {I let him take it, which was probably a slight mistake. My knight was stronger than his bishop and get doubled pawns.} Bxc3+ 13. bxc3 Rhg8 {He develops his rook, attacking my g-pawn.} 14. g3 {I simply move it up a square, preventing a strong attack.} Ne7 {He wants his knight to get to d5, attacking the pawn on c3.} 15. Be3 {I develop my bishop, although Bd2 may have been a better move for me.} Nd5 {He attacks my pawn, but I didn't notice it since this was a 1 minute game.} 16. d4 {I go d4, wanting to trade of pawns, getting a stronger attack in the center.} Nxe3 {A surprising move. Nxc3 would have won my pawn. My opponent probably missed it.} 17. fxe3 exd4 18. cxd4 {I now have huge control over the center.} Rad8 19. O-O Rgf8 20. c4 {c4 controls d5, a critical square.} b6 21. d5+ Ke5 22. Rae1 Ke4 {A slight mistake for black, allowing me to make the following move...} 23. Rf4+ Kd3 24. Rd1+ Kxe3 25. Rfd4 Rde8 26. Rd1d3+ Ke2 27. Kg2 Re3 {A terrible mistake for black. He's hoping I trade off rooks, giving him a very strong position.} 28. Rd3d2+ Ke1 29. Rd2d1+ Ke2 30. Rd4d2# {A nice, simple combination for checkmate.}
