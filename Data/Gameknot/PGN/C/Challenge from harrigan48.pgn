[Opening "Four knights game (C46)"]

1. e4 {I believe that this is the most popular opening move.  However, I do wonder if a 1.d4 opening might be better suited to your attacking style as these openings tend to lead to a more open type of game.  If you want to think about switching to 1.d4, play a few unrated practice games with me or Pete, before you unleash it on the rest of the world, so that we can work through some of the more common defences. It is good to have a working knowledge of a few different openings in your repertoire.  A word of warning though, when experimenting with a new opening, you will almost certainly get beaten the first few times you use it.  We can give you all the theory but your opponent may not stick to the book. Don't get disheartened, you will learn from experience how to adapt to differing responses. A wise man once told me, "chess is such a great game because you can never lose. You either win your game or you learn something".   } e5 {So, I'll respond with the most common move. Both sides are looking to get a good grip on the centre in these opening moves.} 2. Nf3 {This is a good move which attacks e5 and also develops your Knight to it's natural square. Note that on it's previous square, g1 the Knight could possibly reach 2 other squares. In it's current position, on f3, it can now reach six squares, so your move has increased it's power. This is one of the things we mean when we say "development", it is where you increase the usefulness of the piece.} Nc6 {I'll choose the move that I would usually play here. It develops my Knight to a square where it is defending my e pawn. Keep in mind during the opening, that we are both looking for as much control over the central squares as we can get.} 3. Nc3 {Not a bad choice Gena, nothing wrong with it because it develops another Knight and defends your e4 pawn. This is a situation where there is no real right or wrong. I would have played 3. Bc4 or perhaps Bc5, my idea would have been to develop the Bishop and open up the option of castling King side if I need to. This does not mean that my choices are right and yours are wrong, they are all good moves, it comes down to personal preference and I just like to have the castling option open to me as soon as possible.} Nf6 {Now we both have our Knights developed and we are both still working on getting control  of the centre.} 4. Be2 {Sorry Gena, but this move, although not a disaster, is not so good. The questions to ask yourself are, does my move increase the power of my piece? In this case it doesn't. Does it help in my quest to gain control of the centre? No, it doesn't. Did my f3 knight need an extra defender? At this stage of the game it doesn't. Having said that though, this is not something to beat yourself up about. I just want you to get used to the idea of asking yourself these sort of questions before choosing a move in your more serious games.} d5 {Once again, with central control in mind, I think it is time for me to attempt to disrupt your position.} 5. exd5 {Yes, this was a good choice. There is a sort of rule here, if you are offered a piece in the opening, taking it is usually the strongest move. Please note my use of the word "usually", in this case, your move is fine. If you are not sure, it is worth opening up the "analyse the board" option, entering your chosen move and then examining your opponents likely responses to it. } Nxd5 {Of course, I want to recapture.} 6. Bc4 {This is still a good move Gena, even if it is a bit late. Note that you now have two pieces threatening my Knight on d5 which is defended only by one of my pieces. You are asking me a question and I need to come up with a response. Any time you are forcing an opponent to make choices has to be good. Make your opponent do the thinking wherever you can. } Nxc3 {I could have retreated to f6 but I think it is time to be more aggressive and ask you a question. The question of course is, do you recapture with your b or d pawn? } 7. bxc3 {In my opinion, you made the right choice. Recapturing inwards in these situations is usually better than outwards as would have been the case had you chosen the d pawn. The use of the d pawn here may have led to an early exchange of Queens. Once again, note the use of the word "usually".  All rules are there to be broken, so you need to consider it yourself and examine the possible consequences of your chosen move. Anyway, I agree with your choice, it is what I would have chosen too.     As I mentioned during the game, the downside is that whatever choice you made here, you end up with doubled pawns. These doubled pawns are not something to worry about too much, but I see it as a small advantage to me.  Games can sometimes be won by the player who collects the most small advantages. Having said that, I have encountered situations where doubled pawns are useful. So it is not something to fret about at this early stage of the game.} Bd6 {Here, I develop my Bishop, make an extra defender for my e pawn and open the possibility of castling King side if I need to.} 8. d4 {I can't see anything terrible about your choice of move here. It even has the potential to sort out your doubled pawns. My choice here would have been castling, if possible followed by getting the Rook onto the e file, which looks likely to be the open file. Please remember though that this is only what I think and I'm far from being an expert. Once again, I guess it comes down to personal preferences.  } Bg4 {To make life difficult for your Knight. } 9. Be2 {Yes, this was a good move, creating an extra defender for f3.} e4 {I don't want to have the e file open yet, so I'll bypass your pawn.} 10. Ng5 {I'm not sure about this one. Would Bg5 have been better?  Ah, I think I can see why now. You are looking at my e pawn I think.} Qd7 {In case you are not looking at my pawn, I need to defend my f7 square.} 11. Nxe4 {Yes, that's what I thought, but I fear that you may have gone to too much trouble capturing a single pawn.} O-O {I'll take the opportunity to get my King a bit safer as I'm starting to feel that you my try for an attack on the King side.} 12. Bxg4 {I admire your enthusiasm and can see the appeal of this move at first glance. However you have left a perfect gap for me to fork your Bishop and Knight with my f pawn. With more experience, you may become more aware of risks. It is always a good idea to ask yourself if you are likely to suffer any harm as a result of your chosen move. With a slow look around the board, I think you may have seen it.} f5 {Sorry, but I have to follow with the aforementioned  pawn move.} 13. Nf6+ {This looks to be a desperate move. You were probably attracted by the chance to fork my King and Queen. I have seen enough of your games to know how much you love your Knight forks. Did you overlook my Rook? } Rxf6 {So now I can eliminate your Knight.} 14. Be2 {Yes, retreating your Bishop was correct I think.} Re8 {I'm bringing my Rook to the half open e file. I like to have my Rooks placed centrally if I possibly can.} 15. O-O {Good girl, well done. It was at about this point in the game that I asked you if you ever looked at the Chess Tactical Puzzles on here. You told me that you do and that you also play Blitz Attack. I had a look at Blitz Attack and I can see that it is fun but I'm not sure of it's value as a training tool. In fact i worry that as with Blitz Games, it could cause you to develop the bad habit of looking for quick and easy solutions. In my opinion, Chess Tactics is much better because you have unlimited time to solve the puzzle. This means that you are more likely to look everywhere on the board to find the answer which is much more in line with want I want you to do. A lot of this puzzle solving is about pattern recognition, for example a Queen in front of a King or on the same diagonal. Do you have a Rook or Bishop handily placed to take advantage?  I think these patterns or scenarios are more likely to stay in your memory if you are not rushing. Then the great thing is that you will start to look  for these situations in your own games. Please understand that I'm not saying don't play Blitz Attack, just don't take it too seriously and don't allow yourself to get into bad habits  } Ne7 {You have a lot of pieces looking towards my King side, so I'm rushing to get my Knight into a position to assist with the defence.} 16. Qd3 {Possibly I misread the formation of your pieces, I can't see where you are going with your Queen from here. } Ng6 {I finally get my Knight into position ready for defensive duties.} 17. Bh5 {The other Bishop to g5 would have forced  me to move my Rook. Your move doesn't force me to do anything. Try to always get and keep the initiative when you can. Keep asking questions of your opponent and he might get one of the answers wrong. } Qf7 {I'm still a bit concerned about a possible attack, so I'll also throw my Queen into the defence.} 18. Qh3 {Gena, I'm really not sure what you are up to here. } Rfe6 {A little side step to get both my Rooks onto the open e file.} 19. Bg5 {What's going on?  That threatens nothing  and asks me no questions.} h6 {I'm not too concerned about your dark Bishop, but I'll try to get it out of the way.} 20. Bxg6 {This exchange wont achieve anything much. Try to work out exchanges so that they work in your favour. Not always in terms of material but also check the resulting position.} Qxg6 {I have to recapture and now your Bishop is threatened by two of my pieces and you will have to retreat.} 21. Bd2 {The expected retreat of course. I think I would have chosen e3 rather than d2 because that would deter my Rook from getting amongst your pawns on the second rank. When you see a line up of Rooks like that, ignoring them is not a good idea.} Re6e2 {Two rooks on the same open file become very powerful.} 22. Rad1 {That is a good answer} Re8e4 {Now both of my Rooks are active. } 23. Bc1 {That may save your Bishop but I will now be able to capture your c2 pawn. } Rxc2 {There goes the c2 pawn and I think I will also be able to get the a pawn.} 24. Rd3 {A move which further protects your c pawn, but did it need further protection? } Rxa2 {So now I also get the a pawn.} 25. Rg3 {Oh dear Gena. That was not a good square for your Rook, but you are running out of options now. I think what happened was that you saw a chance to threaten my Queen but, you missed the fact that my Bishop is on that diagonal. Before you make  a move,  calm yourself and have a good look around the board. I know from experience that the first move I see when I look at a position is often not the one I finish playing. What I do is look at my game and make some notes about what I want to do next and where I hope to be after that. Then, I'll go away and do something else and come back later for another look and see if I still feel the same. However, even after all this double checking I'm still capable of playing some really stupid moves. So my way is far from infallible. Do what suits you best, all I'm trying to do is get you to slow down a bit and look everywhere on the board.} Bxg3 {Okay, I'll trade my Bishop for your Rook.} 26. Qxg3 {We decided to play this game out to a conclusion, but from this point on I will stop the annotation because there is really nothing more we can gain from it. So, what can we take away from this? !. I can see, not so much from this game but from looking at your other games, that your opening moves have been getting tighter and more solid recently.  This is very good, well done. Remember that when you are playing with the white pieces you already have the initiative and you must try not to lose it. 2.  You need to tighten up  defensively. This is difficult at times because at your level, you get away with stuff, that you might get punished for when playing against even slightly higher rated players. Just make sure that all  your pieces are defended by at least one other piece wherever possible. Just checking for that alone will tighten you up defensively. 3. You have a natural attacking flair. We didn't see it in this game, but once again looking at some of your other games, I can imagine that you must terrify opponents at your level.  Once again though Some of these attacks are not as scary as they first appear but they work at your level. I don't want to do or say anything to discourage your attacking style, but you do need to plan your attacks carefully and be as sure as you can that you will be getting some kind of advantage from them. Otherwise, attacks can rebound on you quite badly if you get them wrong. 4. I get the impression that you are perhaps moving too fast at times and not looking long enough at every area of the board.  I know that Blitz Games and Blitz Attacks are fun but try not to pick up the bad habit of moving too fast and not thinking enough. 5. Remember that on this team, we are not all about winning games and climbing ladders and you will never be criticised for losing games. Don't be afraid to try things out, they may not work first time but you will learn why, so try it again until you get it right. It is always better to have tried and failed rather than not trying at all. I think you are a great player and you already have a lot of the basics. Your rating has been climbing steadily since you have been on the team and I'm sure that this will continue. I think you could easily get into the 1200 rating range and with more experience, even higher than that.  From a personal, Team Captains, point of view we don't currently have a 1200 player, so if you could fill that gap it would wonderful and make my life a bit easier.    I know you are also playing a practice game with Pete. I haven't looked at it yet but Pete and I will compare notes a bit later. It will be interesting to see if he thinks the same as me.  Thanks for the game if you have any questions please don't be afraid to ask. I'm no expert but I'll do everything I possibly can to help you.} Qxg3 27. hxg3 Ra1 28. f3 Re7 29. Bf4 Rxf1+ 30.
