[Opening "English opening (A10)"]

1. c4 g6 {c5 or e5 is played the most. c4 is the first move of the english opening. If someone donot know it, can symmetrical play for 3-5 moves.} 2. d4 {white moves his pieces to the centre, black wants to control it. So blacks' position will be passive for awhile, but with a c5 or e5 later can open the position.} Bg7 {the best place for the bishop by g6. g6 has its' problem. White can play later an h4-h5, if blacks' position not good enough.} 3. Nf3 {white plays for developing. First the knights and then the bishops.} b6 {black moves her another bishop to the long diagonal, too - maybe the best centrecontroller structure.} 4. Bf4 {Another developing move. b2 is weak with it and the g7Bishop has its' pressure on the d4 pawn, too. After e3 this bishop would be isolated, but playable, too.} Bb7 {Totally control of the centre.} 5. e3 {give a diagonal to the f1Bishop and planning the 0-0 to ending the opening and developing.} Nf6 {black ends the development, too with 0-0 next. Black has no weakpoints yet.} 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Bd3 Ng4 {This attack is too early. Blacks' pieces arenot developed.  First Nc6! - maybe after e6 and d5.} 8. h3 {There was ceartinly better moves with tempowin, but I donot like, when the opponents' pieces attacking.} Nf6 {If Nh6, then I exchange my bishop on h6, and black lost her very good defending piece for my small territorier bishop.} 9. O-O {I have ended my development.} Bxf3 {Maybe better is, if black holds the bishoppair with strong pressure on the centre.} 10. Qxf3 {white has four attacking pieces with good pawnstructure, so my position must better to be, but black has no weakpoints still.} Na6 {Black could move c6, Nc6, d5 or this. I think c6 or this is the best. this with c5 next.} 11. a3 {Preventing Nb4 with attack on my bishop.} c5 12. Be5 {I want to exchange my bad bishop for a defender piece on the kingside.} Nh5 13. Bxg7 Nxg7 {Maybe f5 with Nf6 is good, too.} 14. d5 {try to win more territory, black have no more pressure on this diagonal.} f5 15. Ne2 {Try to bring another piece to attack.} e6 16. d6 {I donot wanted to open the line on my undefended bishop.} Rc8 {With Ne8 would be end to my pawn. Now black tries maybe open the c-line with b5 after Nb8-a6.} 17. Nc3 {Planning Nb5.} Rc6 {here is very little the territory of the rook.} 18. Nb5 {to defending the pawn.} Ne8 19. Nxa7 {I get back a pawn for my in the centre. This exchange must be better to be for black.} Rxd6 20. Rfd1 Nf6 {The Knight is on its' best square again. The black squares are very weak, but white has no black bishop.} 21. Nb5 Rc6 22. Rd2 {White makes the simple moves to make pressure on the halfopened line gainst the black queen.} d5 {Maybe with the Nc7 exchange the queen would came out of the d-line and would better later this move.} 23. cxd5 exd5 24. Bc4 {The key-move what wins the pawn.} Rd6 {The mistake, what gives the absolute winning position for white.} 25. Nxd6 Qxd6 26. Bxd5+ {With Bxa6 all is over, but I didnot see this. I saw, that after the exchanges I have a winning endgame.} Nxd5 27. Qxd5+ Qxd5 28. Rxd5 {This is the winning position to begin an endgame.} Nc7 29. Rd7 Rc8 30. Rad1 Ne6 31. Rd1d6 Nf8 32. Rb7 Re8 33. Rbxb6 Kg7 34. Rdc6 Kh6 {}
