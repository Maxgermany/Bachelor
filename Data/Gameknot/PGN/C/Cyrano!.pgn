1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Master Chrisobee, one of my Master buddies kindly invited me to a mini-tournament containing mostly Masters and Experts and two GRANDMASTERS!  I lost both my games to Ruwurtinger (whose rating was over 2500 at the time) then I found myself paired up against the Gameknot Grandmaster that every chessplayer on Gameknot has been dreaming of playing - that is, GM CYRANO!  Here I find myself playing against a Sicilian Naijdorf in which we both play book moves for the first 15 moves.  I will talk you through them.  There is also a Gameknot Analysis link to this game which is as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15425960&rnd=0.49847992558701476} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - I decided to tread on familiar ground in the Sicilian.  Occasionally I deviate on move 2 with either c3, d3 or even f4 but I felt I would rather revert to book as at least I am becoming familiar with this opening.} Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {5. .... a6 - here is the Naijdorf - this little pawn move supports a later b5 which will lead to a queenside pawn storm as white normally castles on the queenside in the Naijdorf and Yugoslav Attack of the Sicilian Dragon which then involves an exciting race of whose king topples first, sometimes that Chessic Grim Reaper, Old Matey doesn't quite know where to look as one mating threat may move from one side to another!!} 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3 {8. f3 - this sequence now transposes into the Fisher-Byrne Attack.  It is called an attack because if black should castle on the kingside, a white pawn storm can sometimes appear out of nowhere with moves such as g4 and h4 being the start of it.} Be7 9. Qd2 {9. Qd2 - a fairly standard stance for Glenda (my queen) to adopt.  Should a black pawn move to g6 then Fou Lenoir can get into h6 defended by Glenda (now when is that poor put upon lassie not defending something?!)} O-O 10. O-O-O {10. 0-0-0 - both kings castle on opposite wings as I mentioned in a previous note.  For a long time, Glenda will sit on d2 doing nothing but defend Fou Lenoir and at the same time, darn a much needed new pair of medieval stockings for her beloved seafood loving other half, Henry, so that he doesn't catch cold if and when his castled position becomes just a little draughty.} Nbd7 11. g4 {11. g4 - see my previous note on move 8.} b5 {11. .... b5 - and black counters with that b5 move I talked about on move 5.} 12. g5 Nh5 13. Nd5 Bxd5 14. exd5 {14. exd5 - on my last move I tried to establish a decent outpost for my knight on d5.  At least this has made black give up his light square bishop for it to remove it and more pertinently the bishop pair.  I now establish a pawn on d5 to try and cramp Afro's (GM Cyrano's) style.} f6 15. gxf6 Bxf6 16. Na5 {16. Na5 - still book.  There is a possibility of establishing that knight on c6.  In this game, however, that knight never quite gets there.} Qe8 17. Bh3 Nf4 18. Bxf4 exf4 {18. ..... exf4 - this gives black an isolated queen pawn on d6.} 19. Rhe1 Ne5 20. Re4 Kh8 21. Qe2 {21. Qe2 - Glenda moves onto the e column to indirectly pile up on the knight on e5.  It is always a good idea to have a rook on the same file as The Wicked Witch of the West (enemy queen) no matter how many pieces are in front of it.} Qg6 22. Qg2 Qh5 {22. .... Qh5 - declines an exchange of queens.} 23. Bg4 Nxg4 24. fxg4 {24. fxg4 - here is where my game starts to go wrong.  Afro cunningly forces exchanges on his terms and ends up with two connected passed pawns.} Qg5 25. Kb1 {25. Kb1 - Henry moves off the discovery line c1-h6.  Failure to do this will result in the loss of Glenda to the moves f3, 26 Kb1, PXQ.} Rae8 26. h3 {26. h3 - I decided not to initiate a trade off of rooks because that would only concede the e column to a black rook.  I decided to back up my g4 pawn instead.} Rxe4 27. Qxe4 Qe5 28. Qxe5 {28. Qxe5 - this trade of queens is virtually forced as if I play 28. c3?? then Glenda drops to QXQ as she is hanging.  If Glenda moves off the e column then I will cop Old Matey by QxP#.  Afro recaptures with the pawn for a very good reason.....} dxe5 29. d6 {29. d6?? - the normal maxim is that passed pawns must be pushed and indeed it seemed a good idea at the time, especially as my d pawn was ably supported by my rook on d1 and there was a knight waiting to come into c6 to contest the queening square.  For one moment I had a hallucination that my pawn would crown and Afro would have to give up material for it and I would get my first ever non-timeout victory over a 2000+ player in style!  Hmmp, a Class B Amateur beating a Grandmaster .....} e4 {29. ...... e4! - ..... with this move Afro says "Dream On".  My d pawn, although more advanced than the two connected black pawns can be easily blockaded.  The two connected passers are a completely different matter however.} 30. Nb3 {30. Nb3 - trying to get my knight to help blockade those pawns.  However there is no way I will stop a crowning unless I am prepared to give up ruinous loss of material for it.  Against a mighty GM whose rating was nearly as high as Gary Kasparov's, I would rather draw a line under it, so after Afro advanced his pawn to e3 I decided to wave the white flag.  This game is a salutary lesson of the power of two connected passed pawns in the late middlegame.} e3 {}
