1. e4 {The Caro Kann is supposed to be a very defensive opening for black but Zendenball is a remarquable attacker.} c6 {Caro Kann ! } 2. d4 {Most common line} d5 3. e5 {Classical answer} Bf5 4. Nf3 {protecting the central pawns} e6 {Blocking the center} 5. Be2 {Preparing the castle} Nd7 6. O-O {King in safe} h5 {offensive move but black weakens both sides in case of castling.} 7. b3 {to prepare 8. c4} Be7 {aiming at the kingside} 8. c4 {Classical in Caro Kann} g5 {A pawn storm is coming.} 9. Nc3 {The GK computer points it as a mistake. The machine prefers 9. cxd5 which indeed would have been better. 9. Nc3 is too passive. it doesn't create any serious menace and doesn't prevent black's progression on the kingside.} Nf8 {The black knight is aiming at g6. All the black army is on white's castle side.} 10. Bd3 {to menace f5 but unprotecting the f knight. I think that 10. cxd5 would still have been better. For if 10. ... cxd5 11. Bxb5+ Nd7 - pinned. and if 10. ... exd5, black's center is weakend and the LSB looses one protection.} Nh6 {King near the edge is usually considered as bad but in this case it protects the LSB and takes control of g4} 11. Bxf5 {to prevent 11. ... Bg4} Nxf5 12. Bd2 {To prepare a further Qc1 to attack the g pawn but it's too slow.} g4 {Attacking the brave Lancelot who wanders beneath the caslte wall.} 13. Ne1 {Only move} Nxd4 {I oversaw this move. White is now in serious trouble.} 14. Bf4 {Protecting what's left of white's center} Nf5 {The evil black knight goes back to his place after his raid.} 15. f3 {To get rid of the g soldier who is ranging under the castle wall.} Ng6 {The black cavalery is all out, charging the unprotected DSB.} 16. Nd3 {The brave knight comes to protect the archery. A mistake. 16. Qd2 would have been better.} Nxf4 {Black takes} 17. Nxf4 {trading} Ne3 {I oversaw this fork attack when playing 16. Nd3.} 18. Qd3 {As black has no more LSB, better being on a light square.} Nxf1 {"My king, our castle tower just fell"} 19. Kxf1 {White is now seriously in late of material and his pawn structure is bad.} Qc7 {Attacking the unprotected e man at arms} 20. Qe3 {To protect the center.} O-O-O {rook on the d semi open file.} 21. Qxa7 {Last chance} Qxe5 {menacing both kinghts and the a rook.} 22. Qa8+ {Last attack.} Kc7 {22. ... Kd7 was possible but then 23. Qxb7+} 23. Nb5+ {The knight is condemned, better dying after a nice charge.} cxb5 {The black king is seriously weakened but white has not enough material left to take profit of it.} 24. Qa5+ {hoping a mistake from black.} Kb8 {Good move. White cannot carry on attacking the black king.} 25. Re1 {Saving the rook.} Qxf4 26. cxb5 {A very last menace, in case if black were too confident.} Qb4 {Good move, white must trade.} 27. Qxb4 {so that...} Bxb4 {Black's advantage is considerable, i still play a couple of moves more without any hope, just to see which strategy my able opponent will elect.} 28. Rc1 gxf3 29. gxf3 Rdc8 30. Ra1 Rc2 31. a3 Bc3 32. Rd1 Rg8 {White submits here. (forced mate in 2) Well done Zendenball ! I have to study the Caro Kann because I early in the game couldn't imagine what to do and plaid a couple of fruitless moves which let black lead a dangerous attack.}
