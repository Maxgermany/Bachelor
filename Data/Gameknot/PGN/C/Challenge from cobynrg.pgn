1. e4 { Classic e4.} e5 {Regular by NRG.} 2. Nc3 {Developing...} Nc6 {Developing as well...} 3. b3 {Want mayB 2 control the diagonal? with Bb2?} Nf6 {Strengthening same diagonal of a1 h8,   threatening e4 & developing further.} 4. Bb2 {obviously.} Nd4 {Exellent move by black, captures the middle while protected by e5 well developed, has no threat of c2 because of Nc3 blocking the way.} 5. Nge2 {White wants to remove the threat. Black will need to strengthen the posiyion even further to remain in control.} Bc5 {As the prophecy foretold.} 6. Na4 {Opening up Bb2   a threat on Bc5, but, mistake, left the guerd on e4, now Nxe5, gaining a magor center position.} d6 {But 1st, protect the B, wasting a bit of time, but also opening for Bc8.} 7. f4 {Bad move by white, should have went for BxNd4 to remove the threat, but probably didn't want to lose the diagonal, then was also possible Nxd5 at least.} Bg4 {Development & the begining of the end game.} 8. h3 {Weak try to remove the threat, Black's next move is obvious...} Bxe2 {Staying in offence & weakening the K's defence.} 9. Bxe2 {Obviously.} Nxe4 {Now is the right time to go in.} 10. Nxc5 {2 little, 2 late. Bxd4 would have been much better.} Qh4+ {White resigns because Qh4   Ne4   Nd4 will win anyway, while white's Q is blocked & all others are 2 far from reaching the battlefield. Swift victory by Black.}
