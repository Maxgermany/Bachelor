1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. d3 d5 {I pressurise the pawn...} 4. Bg5 dxc4 {...and remove it...} 5. Qa4+ {...but as there's no way of saving it...} c6 {...I bing up another to block...} 6. Qxc4 {...and I lose my pawn.} Qd4 {Now I bring up my queen to pressurise my opponent's...} 7. Bxf6 {...but he removes my knight...} Qxc4 {...so I remove his queen...} 8. dxc4 {...but lose mine...} gxf6 {...but take his bishop, distorting my pawn structure.} 9. O-O-O Bh6+ {However, the hole allows me to unleash my bishop...} 10. e3 O-O {...and castle kingside.} 11. Nf3 {After he brings up his knight...} Bg4 {...I unleash my other bishop to pressurise it, potentially along with his rook...} 12. Be2 {...but he brings up his own to cover.} Na6 {Now I bring up my other knight to free my queenside rook...} 13. a3 {...but he covers the b4 square with his pawn...} Bxf3 {...so now I remove his knight...} 14. Bxf3 {...at the expense of my bishop.} Rad8 {Now I bring out a rook to contest the open d-file...} 15. Rxd8 Rxd8 {...and we exchange, and now I have control of the file.} 16. Rd1 {He brings his other rook to contest...} Rxd1+ 17. Kxd1 {...and again we exchange.} Nc5 {Now I put my knight on the attack...} 18. Bg4 {...and he eyes up my bottom rank with his bishop...} Nd3 {...so I attack two pawns at once with my knight...} 19. Ke2 Nxb2 {...and grab one.} 20. c5 {He moves his c-pawn away from my knight...} b6 {...but I attack it with my b-pawn...} 21. cxb6 axb6 {...and we swap, creating yet more space.} 22. Bd7 {He pressurises my c-pawn...} c5 {...so I move it up.} 23. Bb5 f5 {I move my f6-pawn to give my f7-pawn room to manoeuvre, and to help my e-pawn.} 24. Na4 Nxa4 25. Bxa4 {Now we swap knights, leaving another bishop and pawn ending.} f4 {I pressurise his e-pawn...} 26. e4 {...but he pushes it...} Bf8 {...so I retreat my bishop to eye up his a-pawn, but my c-pawn is blocking its path...} 27. Bb5 c4 {...so I move it up...} 28. Bxc4 {...and lose it...} Bxa3 {...but I manage to remove his far left-hand pawn, obliterating his queenside.} 29. f3 {Now my f4-pawn is blocked...} Bb2 {...so I bring up the bishop to cover its neighbour.} 30. h4 Kg7 {I move up my king to cover my h7- and f7-pawns...} 31. g4 {...but this...} fxg3 e.p. {...allows me to undouble my f-pawns, and create a passed pawn, for a possible promotion.} 32. Kf1 Bd4 {Now my bishop moves in to help out...} 33. Kg2 Bf2 {..and covers the pawn.} 34. Bb5 Kg6 35. Kh3 f5 {I pressurise his e-pawn...} 36. exf5+ Kxf5 {...and get the exchange, freeing up mine, and allowing me to pressurise his f-pawn.} 37. Be2 {Although the bishop gets back to cover...} Kf4 {...I bring up my king to potentially pressurise both.} 38. Bd3 Kxf3 {Now I accept the pawn...} 39. Bxh7 {...and although I lose my far left...} g2 {...my second left is on course for promotion, and should he check with my bishop 40. Be4+, I could capture the bishop 40... Kxe4, and if I do lose my pawn 41. Kxg2, I can remove his 41... Bxh4, and I have backup.}
