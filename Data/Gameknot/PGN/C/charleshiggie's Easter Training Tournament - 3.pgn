1. e4 {So I start with the usual} e5 {He replies the same} 2. Nf3 {I do the standard move} d6 {He defends his e pawn in a slightly unusual way. Nc6 or Nf6 are more common. This should be playable though.} 3. d4 {So I advance in the centre.} Bg4 {This relieves the attack on e5, but at the cost of giving up a bishop for a knight. exd4, Nf6 or Nd7 were better moves} 4. dxe5 {so I take on here. We are actually following a very famous game, Paul Morphy vs Duke Karl / Count Isouard "A Night at the Opera" http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1233404} Bxf3 {He has to take the knight, or lose a pawn. If dxe5 instead, I can just exchange queens and then take on e5.} 5. Qxf3 {So I take with the queen, developing} dxe5 {He takes back} 6. Bc4 {As played by Paul Morphy} Nf6 {Still following the steps of Morphy} 7. Qb3 {With a double attack on f7 and b7. In the Morphy game, black played Qe7, preparing to meet Qxb7 with Qb4+! and the queens come off. White would have the better ending, a pawn up. Morphy preferred to play Nc3 instead of taking on b7.} Qd7 {This is inferior} 8. Qxb7 {Now he loses a rook. If Qc6? to try and hold the rook, Bb5! wins the black queen.} Nc6 {Gameknot post-match computer analysis gives this as a mistake, but black is already lost} 9. Qxa8+ {So I take the rook} Nd8 {Knight blocks the check} 10. O-O {I castle} h5 {A mad attack on the king side. Gameknot suggest Bc5 as being better.} 11. Nc3 {So I develop} h4 {At least he is consistent!} 12. Rd1 {I hit the queen} Bd6 {He blocks} 13. Bg5 {I develop} h3 {He continues with his plan. Unfortunately there is little to back up this pawn.} 14. Bb5 {Gameknot gives this as a blunder, resulting in a position which is "only" plus 9.97, instead of Rxd6 with an advantage of plus 13.71 I am not sure it makes much difference.} hxg2 {This is a blunder, but it is lost anyway.} 15. Bxd7+ {So I take} Kxd7 {He takes back.} 16. Bxf6 {Might as well exchange pieces while I am ahead.} gxf6 {He takes back} 17. Nb5 {Aiming to exchange on d6} Rg8 {The pawn finally gets some support, but it is too little too late.} 18. Nxd6 {Gameknot gives this as another blunder by me, and prefers Rxd6} Ne6 {One last effort, maybe I will not notice that move discovers an attack on the queen.} 19. Qxg8 {Oh dear, I did notice. Black resigns.}
