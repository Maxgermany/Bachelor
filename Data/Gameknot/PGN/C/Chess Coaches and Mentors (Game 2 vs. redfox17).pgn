[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 {A opening move I'm quite accustomed to, the King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {This is always my response, to King's Pawn, the King's Pawn Game.} 2. Bc4 {White plays the Bishop's Opening. I already know white is planning to see if I fall for the 'checkmate in three moves' strategy, but I never fall for that anymore.} Nf6 {I respond with another move I'm popular with, the Bishop's Opening, Berlin Defence, which pretty much ruins any hope for a checkmate on f7. } 3. d3 {This is not a opening in the book, so the book ends early. } Nc6 {Black pulls out the other knight. } 4. Bg5 {Another common move. This either usually ends in a bishop, knight exchange or white retreats the bishop.} Be7 {I open myself up for castling king-side. } 5. Nf3 h6 {Moment of truth...} 6. Bh4 {...and white retreats the bishop. } g5 {Another common move I make. I want to drive back the bishop further. } 7. Bg3 O-O {Normally, this is a good move. You castle and protect your king further. Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy. I couldn't understand this at first, but it didn't take me long to see why. There are 2 white pieces focused on the black e5 pawn, but only 1 black piece focused on the pawn. The result will be a +1 material point advantage for white. Although not much of a advantage, it is still an advantage.  } 8. Nxe5 Nxe5 9. Bxe5 {Black now has a small advantage, but being so small, I was not worried. } d6 {After what I saw earlier, I expected white to retreat his bishop again.} 10. Bc3 {I was quite correct. } Bg4 {Yet another popular move by black. I bring my bishop out to attack the queen, and the bishop is protected by the knight. Of course, white will protect it. } 11. Qd2 {I was actually expecting white to play 11. f3, but this move works to. } d5 {I bring a strong attack that involves my knight and queen. It's not likely though that I would get a material advantage. } 12. exd5 Nxd5 13. Bd4 {I'm not surprised white didn't play 13. Bxd5, but why Bd4 when white could castle? The computer analysis does view this as a mistake and that a king-side castle was the best move. } c6 {I decide to protect my knight just in case white does decide to attack. I did not see a possible advantage though. 13. ... Nf4 14. Be5 Nxg2+ 15. Kf1 ... This sequence would of not only gave me back my material advantage, but also would give me an advantage in position on the board, but again, I missed the opportunity. } 14. Nc3 {White responds with a stronger attack on the black knight. This is an inaccuracy by the computer analysis and that a king-side castle was again the best move. } Bb4 {I still do not see the advantage I could gain and I instead attack the knight just brought out by white. No surprise that the computer analysis views this as a mistake and that Nf4 was again the best move. } 15. O-O {White now castles and any immediate advantage for black was lost. } Nb6 {With this move, I hope to attack white's DSB on d4 with my queen. I expect white to of course protect it, for white clearly sees his bishops as assets.} 16. Rae1 {??? What happened to something like Be3 or Bxb6? White was clearly focusing on a attack and did not realize that his d4 bishop was wide open to black's queen. This will result in a good +2 advantage for black. Computer analysis views this as a blunder and that Bxb6 was the best move.} Qxd4 {Black also has a pretty good position on the board along with the material advantage, but white's is pretty exceptional to.} 17. Qe3 {Well, not the best move. Computer analysis views this as an inaccuracy and that Re4 was the best move. Very true for then white would threaten both the queen and the g4 bishop, thus likely retaking a small material advantage. This current move threatens a queen exchange, but I am not willing to exchange queens, but I did have plans to attack white's knight. } Bxc3 {I follow through with my plan.} 18. bxc3 {White takes the bishop and does not offer a queens exchange. } Qd6 {Here, in my view at the time, I felt black was lining up for a strong attack, which was not really true, but I felt falling back was a good idea. Not really.After looking at the board, in my view, I should of attacked the c3 pawn, thus giving me more of an advantage. In the computer analysis's views though, this move is a mistake and that Qxe3 was the best move. Although I do not favor a queens exchange, it was the best move. This sequence may of followed and left black with more of an advantage:  19. Rxe3 Nxc4 20. dxc4 Rfe8 21. Rg3 Be2 22. Rb1 Bxc4 23. h4 f6 24. Rxb7 Bxa2 25. hxg5 fxg5 26. f4 Re1+ 27. Kh2 Re2 28. fxg5. It also would be putting white in a bad position on the board, but this did not happen so the game will play out differently. } 19. h3 {An attack on black's bishop. } Nxc4 {I give white an option here, bishop or knight. Obviously knight since it threatens white's queen.} 20. Qe7 {White pushes for a queens exchange. Normally, I would reject, but seeing my b7 pawn threatened by his queen along with white getting deep in my territory, I would decide to go ahead. Computer analysis views this move as a blunder and that dxc4 was the best move. hxg4 probably was second best. } Qxe7 {I allow queens exchange. Computer analysis though views this as a mistake and that Be6 was the best move. True, for when white takes black's queen, the rook can't get deep into black's territory. Instead, now black's rook will get deep into my territory and threaten the b7 pawn. } 21. Rxe7 Nd2 {My plan now is to attack the other rook. White cannot make the move Rfd1 because of black's bishop, so this plan also saves black's knight and bishop. } 22. Rfe1 {A move I expected, the rooks are lined up now. } Bh5 {I save the bishop, but there was still the matter of the b7 pawn...} 23. Rxb7 {...which white would take. Black still has a big advantage!} c5 {I'm looking to start attacking the white pawns on the c and d files } 24. Rc7 {White attacks the progressing pawn, but I will not allow him to succeed. } Rfc8 {It's nice that my rooks are lined up as well. } 25. Rb7 {No trade of the rooks. I expected that.  } c4 {I did plan for fair trade between the two pawns, but I seemed to of forgot here how white does not favor fair trade. } 26. d4 {Again, there is no trade. } Bg6 {I hope to gain the c2 pawn. } 27. Re2 {I was actually expecting Rc1, but this move is much better for it protects the pawn and attacks the intruding knight. } Ne4 {Only safe move for the knight. It is protected by the bishop. This move also attacks the unprotected c3 pawn. } 28. d5 {? White did not try to defend his c3 pawn. It is gone now. } Nxc3 29. Rd2 Be4 {My next plan is to attack the d5 pawn. It is now under attack from the knight and the bishop. } 30. Re7 {I don't see how this move would help white. } Bxd5 {I follow through with my plan. Surprisingly, the computer analysis views this move as a blunder. It kinda is because if white plays Re3 next move, the knight is lost (or the bishop). The best move was Re8, an attack on white's e7 rook.  } 31. Rb7 {?!?!?! On top of white missing the opportunity of gaining a piece back, he put his rook right in the path of my bishop! White was already in a hole. Now he's in a hole with grease on the sides! Of course the computer analysis views this as a blunder. The best move was Re3, as pointed out in the previous comment. } Bxb7 {Black's advantage is massive now!} 32. Rd7 {I will not allow my bishop to be taken. } Ne2+ 33. Kh2 Bc6 {I attack the intruding rook. } 34. Re7 {White attacks my knight. Of course I must save my knight so it is not taken... } Kf8 {...but for some reason, I felt using my king to attack the rook was the best move. Of course not! Black's knight is gone now! This move is a mistake in view of the computer analysis and that Re8 was again the best move. } 35. Rxe2 {White gains back a little, but black still has a really big advantage. } Rce8 {Now I play Re8, but it's a little late for that now lol} 36. Rd2 c3 {I attack the rook again. The computer analysis though views this as a mistake and that Rad8 was the best move. This is a mistake because if black plays Rd3, that pawn is lost. } 37. Rd6 {White plays this move instead. White sure is quite persistent on taking the bishop. This is a good move though for now the h6 pawn is lost. } Bb7 38. Rxh6 {The pawn goes, but the computer analysis views this as a blunder? Well yes, it is because if black plays Re2, white's c2 pawn is lost, and a pawn promotion is much more imminent. Rd7 was the best move here. } Be4 {I plan to take the c3 pawn with my bishop instead of my rook and provoke the pawn promotion. Computer analysis though views this as a mistake and that again Re2 was the best move. } 39. Rc6 {?!?!?! I see that white's plan was to take my c3 pawn after I took his c2 pawn, but who cares about that plan of mine now, for white has put his remaining powerful piece in the path of my bishop, again! White was in a hole with grease on the sides, but now white is simply in a hole that he can't get out of now. Yes computer analysis views this as a blunder! The best move was f4, an attack on black's bishop. } Bxc6 {Black has won. I've never seen a bishop so hungry lol. All jokes aside, the only ways black could lose now is to either allow white to promote one or two pawns or for black to blunder badly multiple times. Neither of those will happen. } 40. f3 Ba4 {Now a pawn promotion seems inevitable. } 41. a3 {No resignation, white keeps playing.  } Bxc2 42. g4 Ba4 {I'm preparing to regain my queen, well, at this moment. } 43. f4 {White has simply run out of options to play now. His f4 pawn is lost. } gxf4 44. h4 {White is interested in promoting his two pawns. } Re3 {I was planning on promoting my pawn, but my plans have changed now...} 45. g5 Rb8 {...I hope for checkmate in a couple of moves. } 46. h5 {White is focused on promoting his pawns. Unfortunately for him, that was a bad move, mate in 2. } Rb2+ 47. Kg1 {No hope for white, mate in 1. } Re1# {Checkmate! redfox17 fought a well-fought battle, but black simply destroyed white in the end. There were plenty of mistakes, but we all make mistakes at one point or another. This wonderful game was now over. I can safely say this was my second best game ever! Very fun and enjoyable indeed!
