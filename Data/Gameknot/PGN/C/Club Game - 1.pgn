1. e4 {My usual} d6 {Pirc} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {Still mainline} 4. f4 {Austrian attack} Bg7 5. Bd3 {Book says Nf3 then Be3 but I forgot that but I can still transpose back} c5 {!? I had never seen this before} 6. dxc5 dxc5 7. Be3 {Attacking the c-pawn} Qc7 8. Qd2 {Preparing f5 and then Bh6 trading of the Black DSB and weakening the black k-side} Ng4 {Threatening to capture my bishop} 9. Nd5 Qd6 {Not the horrible Qc6 which falls to Bb5 pinning the Queen} 10. O-O-O {I castle to double up on the d-file} O-O {I saw 12. e5 a couple of moves ago but needed to get it into a good position} 11. Bc4 Rd8 {I think he was thinking of protecting his queen from a discovered attack but I had other plans} 12. e5 {!(!) I have the second exclamation in brackets because some may disagree} Qd7 {Not: Qc7 loses the queen, Qc6 forked by Nxe7+, Qb6 and Qa6 loses the queen, Qe6 follows the same line as the game and Qf6 loses the queen} 13. Nxe7+ Qxe7 14. Qxd8+ Bf8 {Not Qxd8 because Rxd8+ then Bf8 Rxc8 wins material} 15. Qxe7 Bxe7 16. Bxc5 {I played this before thinking through whether or not it was sound} Bxc5 17. Rd8+ Kg7 {? Better was Bf8 because I have to play Nh3 and he can then develop his LSB and protect it} 18. Rxc8 {I don't care about Nf2 because I still get the bishop} Be3+ 19. Kd1 {I used to think Kb1 was better but if Nf2 then Ke2 I only lose the exchange} Bxf4 {? Better was Nf2+ forking the King and rook} 20. Nh3 {I want to protect the fork} Bxe5 21. Re1 {Wanting to plan Re7 attacking the the f-pawn and then I also get the b-pawn as well} Bxh2 22. Re7 Ne5 23. Bd5 {Threatening to capture the b-pawn and win the rook} Nbc6 24. Rxa8 Nxe7 {I agree to exchange rooks} 25. Bxb7 Ne7c6 26. Ng5 {Threatening Nf3 and if Bg3 then Nxe5 Nxe5(Bxe5 drops the c6 knight) winning the a-pawn} Bg1 27. Nf3 Nxf3 28. gxf3 {Was Bxc6 better} Ne5 29. Re8 f6 30. Bd5 {Threatening Rg8+} h5 31. c4 {I start my own pawn advance} h4 32. f4 Nd3 33. Ke2 {Should I have played Rg8 + threatening Rh8# if Kh6} Nxf4+ 34. Kf1 Bd4 35. Re4 {I fork the Bishop and knight} Be5 36. b4 {Maybe c5 was better} h3 37. Kg1 g5 38. b5 {I continue my push} g4 39. Re3 {?? This is the blunder that costs me} Bd4 {! pins the rook} 40. Kh2 {I lok to remove the threat of queening but I am now lost} Bxe3 41. Kg3 Nxd5 42. cxd5 Bb6 43. a4 {I might as well keep on pushing my pawns} Kf7 {He moves toward my d-pawn} 44. d6 Ke6 45. d7 Kxd7 {I kept on pushing looking for a stalemate} 46. Kxg4 h2 47. Kf5 Bd4 48. a5 h1=Q {I hope I can stale mate} 49. b6 axb6 50. a6 b5 51. a7 Bxa7 52. Kxf6 Qe4 53. Kg5 Qf3 {I resign here. All comments welcome}
