[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Smith-Morra gambit, Chicago defence"]

1. e4 c5 2. d4 {Smith-Morra gambit (I heard that it would be a weak opening, but I play it almost always against Sicilian.)} cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 {Classical} d6 6. Bc4 Nf6 7. O-O {quickly castled} Bg4 8. Bf4 e6 {we've both opened well. Problem is that he can't castle yet because of his black B} 9. h3 Bh5 {giving the K some space to flee and driving the B back} 10. Qb3 {I would like to ask if this was a good move of me (I'm white)} Bxf3 11. gxf3 {I guess I had to take the B} Nd4 {He's entering my lines} 12. Qxb7 Nxf3+ {He checks me, but it seems he hasn't yet noticed the thread of my Q.} 13. Kh1 Rb8 {He completely focused on my Q that he forgot the white B so I could play} 14. Bb5+ {Here he resigned, he would've lost his rook for sure, I'm much better developed and he will come in trouble with my black B anyway.}
