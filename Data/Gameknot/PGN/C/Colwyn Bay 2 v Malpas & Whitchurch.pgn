1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Bc4 c5 9. Ne2 Nc6 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bxf7+ Rxf7 13. fxg4 Rxf1+ {This has all been seen many times before. It was the old "main line" of the Gr√ºnfeld Defence, Exchange Variation. Please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence#Exchange_Variation:_4.cxd5_Nxd5_5.e4 From about 1960 to about 1980 it wasn't played much, it being replaced by Smyslov's idea of 10....Qc7 followed by 11. Rc1 Rd8, but this was rather put out of business by 12. Bf4! so players went back to this older system. To quote from Wiki "this was frequently played by Karpov, including four games of his 1987 world championship match against Kasparov in Seville, Spain, is the Seville Variation, after 6...Bg7 7.Bc4 c5 8.Ne2 Nc6 9.Be3 0-0 10.0-0 Bg4 11.f3 Na5 12.Bxf7+, long thought a poor move by theory, as the resultant light-square weakness had been believed to give Black more than enough compensation for the pawn.} 14. Qxf1 {Taking with the king is just as good.} Nc4 {Notice how I also often play Nb8-c6-a5-c4 while playing black in the Sicilian Defence} 15. Qf2 {This is just about forced, if white wants to hang onto the pawn.} Qd7 {This was played against me when I had white in this variation. I was surprised to see in the databases, Qb6 is more common. This seems logical, hitting g4 and putting the queen on a white square - which seems logical as white squared bishops have been indirectly exchanged.} 16. Rf1 {This indirectly protects the pawn, if I take on g4 he checks on f7, picking up my knight on c4. It allows me to win back the pawn though, so I prefer h3.} Rf8 {So I hit the queen, driving it to an inferior square.} 17. Qg3 {To protect g4 and e3} Rd8 {Rather than take the pawn back immediately, I ratchet up the pressure and he cracks.} 18. dxc5 {This drops a piece} Qd3 {He can't protect the bishop and the knight.} 19. Bd4 {So if saves his bishop} Qxe2 {I take the knight} 20. Bxg7 {He takes the bishop. I could have just taken the bishop, but I found something much stronger.} Ne3 {and he resigned. Why? Give me some variations please!  I hope you enjoyed this game. Please feel free to comment, please rate it on the star system, I need to know how I am doing! Many thanks for reading dear reader!}
