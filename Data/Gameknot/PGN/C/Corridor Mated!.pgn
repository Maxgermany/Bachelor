1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It's ding-a-ling, time for Round 2 in my Welcome MT Part 1 against Terence (Elyhim).  Terence k'oed me in less than 20 moves, aaargh and double aaargh!  So, how did this happen?  Well, here is a clue?  Old Matey just lurves those back ranks and corridors, and to the detriment of Henry, he found a nice little corridor here!  Now, I started off with 1. e4 and Terence responds with g6 which is the Robatsch Defense.  Just like the Pirc and the Sicilian Dragon, that black dark square bishop can prove an almighty handful.} g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. c4 {3. c4 - an impressive array of pawns here.  Alas, this pawn wall can be quite easily breached!} c5 4. d5 {4. d5 - this advance ensures that that monster dsb rakes it's way right through to a1, in which my rook is standing.  This will make it awkward for Fou Lenoir to get off c1 later in the game.} d6 5. Nc3 a6 {5. a6 - hmm, black does not want to exchange his strong bishop for my knight even though this will ensure I am left with pawn islands on the queenside.} 6. a4 Nf6 7. Nge2 a5 8. Ng3 {8. Ng3 - this move ensures my e4 pawn is doubly defended and clears the way for Fou Leblanc to clear the decks for Henry to castle kingside.} Na6 9. Be2 Nb4 {9. ...... Nb4 - Terence has an ideal toe-hold for his knight.  It cannot be pushed away by pawn jabs.  It will have to be one of my pieces which must try to exchange it off.} 10. Nb5 {10. Nb5 - maybe I can do the same to him, perhaps?!  However, Terence soon shows me that imitation is the merest form of flattery!} h5 11. f3 h4 {11. ..... h4 - Terence is certainly flattered by Easy19.  This is certainly a good bit of imitation now, that pawn push down the h file.  So to prevent my knight becoming a horseburger for that little fellow on h4 I am gonna have to move said knight to f1.  This will certainly delay castling for at least one move.  In retrospect, maybe it would not have been a bad thing ..... hmm.} 12. Nf1 Nh5 13. Ne3 {13. Nc2 - I decided to try and exchange off that knight on b4.} Bd7 14. Nc2 Be5 {14. ..... Bc5 - that noisome black bishop finds a nicesome square where it can wreak mayhem on my pos - on both sides of it.} 15. O-O {15. 0-0 - castles, but into it!} Bxb5 16. axb5 Nxc2 17. Qxc2 {17. Qxc2 - it seems as though these exchanges have relieved my position.  However, things are just about to take a sinister turn.  Starting with Terence's next move.} Bd4+ 18. Kh1 {18. Kh1?? - this move allows Henry to Cop Old Matey in the corridor.  Terence said that I should have given up the exchange by playing Rf2.  Funnily enough, the Gameknot Analysis suggested that I would have had a perfectly viable game if I had done this.  Sadly at the time I did not see it that way, played Kh1 and missed the mate, aaaargh, this is the stuff of knightmares - mummy please put on that light!!} Ng3+ 19. hxg3 hxg3+ 20. Bh6 Rxh6# {}
