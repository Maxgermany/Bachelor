1. c4 {First game of the season for me, and I am afraid another loss. Full result can be viewed here, http://www.cdchessleague.org.uk/results.php?club=Malpas_Oswestry&team=1} e5 {So it starts as an English opening. I play the Reversed Sicilian. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Opening} 2. Nc3 {The usual move.} g6 {This is a bit unusual, but not necessarily bad.} 3. e3 {White develops.} Bg7 {As does black.} 4. d4 {White strikes in the centre.} Nc6 {Although I didn't know it at the time, we are already out of the opening databases that I use. Fritz prefers d6.} 5. Nf3 {White develops.} d6 {So do I.} 6. Be2 {White continues to develop.} f5 {This is probably over-ambitious. Fritz likes 6. Nf6 here.} 7. dxe5 {White takes.} dxe5 {Fritz also thinks this is inferior to Nxe5.} 8. Qxd8+ {He takes the queen. Which way would you take back dear reader?} Nxd8 {Fritz prefer taking with the king, but I didn't want to give up castling rights.} 9. h4 {I thought that this move was strange at the time and Fritz agrees with me.} Ne6 {It now gives a slight edge to black!} 10. Ng5 Ne7 {This is a mistake, I missed a tactic. Fritz says 10...c6 is correct with a slight edge to black.} 11. Nb5 {Fritz now gives this as plus 1.3 to white.} Nxg5 {I decided to sacrifice the exchange. Fritz prefers Rb8, but rather than just tamely give up a pawn I thought I could head for complications where in exchange for an exchange and a pawn his knight will be out of play on a8 and eventually lost.} 12. hxg5 {But he simply recaptured rather than taking the offered c7 pawn and Ra8.} Kd7 {I have memories of a Capablanca game where queens came off early and the king became safe on c6. Unfortunately in this case it was not to be, and the less adventurous 12. Kd8 is better.} 13. O-O {White castles.} Kc6 {I carry on with my plan. Fritz still likes Kd8 with only minimal advantage to white.} 14. a4 {White starts a pawn storm against the black king. Frizt now likes 14. h6 with equality, but I played....} Rd8 {This - to contest the open file. I reasoned, why swap off his pawn on g5 which may prove a weakness in an ending.} 15. b4 {White continues with the pawn storm.} Be6 {I simply develop. Fritz regards this as the best move, although also considers 15....h6. 0.4 to black now.} 16. Ba3 {With ideas of moving the knight on b5 and playing b4-b5+ discovering an attack on my Ne7. Fritz now likes 16...Kd7 with only minimal advantage to white.... but....} Rd2 {Why not? Get active!} 17. Rfd1 {This is why not! White doesn't do anything about the attack on the Be2 as there is a nasty attack if black takes the bishop with 17.....Rxe2 18. Nc3 attacking Re2 and threatening b4-b5+ for instance 18....Rc2 19. b5+ kb6 20. a5+ Kxa5 21. Bc5+ Rh2 22. Rxh2# See https://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=212345 I did study 17......Ra-d8 and worked out that if white takes the offered pawn, 18. Nxa7+ black is actually doing OK, but I was worried about 18. Nd4+ which wins a rook for knight and pawn. However this is better than what I played, which was just to give him mastery of the open file and myself a very passive position. After 17.....Ra-d1 18. Nd4+ Fritz gives it as just over plus 1 to white.} Rxd1+ {So I did this instead.} 18. Rxd1 {He took back.} a6 {Fritz likes this move - giving my king a square to run to.} 19. Nc3 {Attacked knight drops back.} Kb6 {Fritz considers this move, but eventually plumps for 19....e5-e4 instead.} 20. a5+ {He throws in a check.} Ka7 {King runs.} 21. b5 {White continues the pawn storm, discovering an attack on Ne7.} Re8 {Fritz likes this rook move.} 22. Na4 {His knight is heading for c5. } axb5 {Fritz also considers this move, but evenutally goes for e5-e4 again.} 23. Nc5 {Rather than taking back immediately white hops in with the knight. I did consider playing 23....Bxc4, which is what Fritz thinks I should have done, but I was a bit hesitant at allowing his rook into d7, so I played....} Bc8 {This, but now black has a very passive position.} 24. cxb5 {He takes back. Fritz likes 24....c6 here, but I played...} Kb8 {Bishop coming in for the kill now!} 25. Bc4 e4 {Played so that Bg7 can come over to e5 and protect c7 in some variations. Fritz prefers 25....Ka8 or 25....Ka7 or 25....c6 all with big advantages to white (over 2 but less than 3).} 26. Nd7+ {Now I should take, but Fritz gives it as over plus 3 for white now....} Ka8 {I played this, and then realised that he had a simple with with 27. Nf6 and if 26...BxNf6 27. gxBf6 Ng8(its only safe square) 28. f3-f2 forking knight and rook. I was preparing to resign should he play 27. Nf6, but he found another way.} 27. Bf7 {And I resigned.
