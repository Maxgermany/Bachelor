1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 Qe7 {Early Queen move. What purpose does it serve? The threat to the e pawn is easily deflected.} 5. O-O d6 6. d4 Nd7 7. e5 b6 8. exd6 {Now the early Queen move comes back to haunt Black.} Qf6 9. Qe2+ Be7 {Yielding up the Bishop. 9...Ne7 also works. 9...Kd8 gives up on castling, but leads to 10. Nxg5 Qxg5 11. Pxc7+ KxP 12. Bf4+!! forking the King and Queen and winning the latter after QxB 13. RxQ} 10. dxe7 Nxe7 11. Re1 O-O {Castling into such an open position may not be best. 11... Bb7, opening the way for a Queen side castle might have been better.} 12. Qxe7 {Winning the Knight and increasing Black's material deficit.} Qxe7 13. Rxe7 Nf6 14. Nxg5 h6 {This does little to help Black, though granted he is in trouble anyway.} 15. Nxf7 {Setting up a discoverd check (or gaining the Rook for Knight exchange).} h5 {Attempting to save the Pawn.} 16. Bxf4 c6 17. Be5 {White could have gone for the check here, with 17. Ng5+ Kh8 18. Be5 (pinning the N), leaving Black with few options to prevent 19. BxN+ RxB 20. Rh7++  But here White plays the pin ahead fo time.} Ne4 {?? Black abandons the King entirely while he is surreounded by hostile forces.} 18. Nh6# {Black suffered in this game from too early development of the Queen, failure to develop his minor pieces, and unfamiliarity with the defense he utilized. 3...g5 is a strong defense to the King's gambit, but only if Black knows how to muster that defense. Declining the gambit is probably better.}
