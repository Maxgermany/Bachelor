1. e4 e6 2. d4 c5 3. Nf3 Nc6 {comment from RD: 3...Nc6 is weak. White should reply 4 d5.} 4. Bb5 Qa5+ 5. Nc3 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 Nf6 8. Bd3 {comments from RD: 8 Bd3 is bad! It allowed his ...e5 on the next move.  White should play 8 Bd2, intending 9 Nd5, and if 9...Qxb5 10 Nc7 .} e5 9. Qe3 Bc5 10. Qg5 Bf8 11. Bd2 h6 12. Nd5 {comments form RD: At move 12, the trade of Q's is a big mistake. White has the lead in development, and it will be very hard for Black to develop his Bf8 if you just play 12 Qg3, intending to continue 13 Nd5. After this, White's game goes downhill. White had a big edge before the trade of Q's.} hxg5 {I have a choice of taking his Knight with a check, or taking his Queen. } 13. Bxa5 {I think I should have taken the Knight first so as to disrupt his Pawns, then I could have taken the Queen. A small thing, but little things can mean a lot.} Nxd5 14. exd5 Bc5 15. Bc7 O-O {White can't take the Pawn on e now as the Bishop would get pinned by Black's Rook next move.} 16. O-O d6 17. Ba5 a6 18. Rac1 b5 19. b4 Ba7 20. Bc7 Bb8 21. Bb6 f5 22. c4 Bd7 23. c5 e4 24. Be2 g6 25. c6 Bc8 {At this point I (White) think I have a pretty good position if I don't do something to screw it up. His King is rather in the open and mine looks safe, in spite of all those Pawns marching toward him.} 26. c7 {This was exactly what I did not need to do. It looked like a deadly attack, but actually was a big mistake.} Ba7 27. Bxa7 {This was probably another mistake. I could have used that Biship I traded off to help defend the Pawn, but now I don't have him any longer. I coul have moved the Bishop to a5 to maintain the defense of the Pawn, but chose otherwise.} Rxa7 {Not only have I lost a defender, I have gained an attacker on that pawn.} 28. Rc6 Rf6 29. Rfc1 Kf7 {Now, failing to count the moves, I try an attack on the Bishop that can not succeed. I guess I hoped to drive the Bishop away so I could promote the Pawn, but that ain't gonna happen.} 30. Rb6 Ke7 31. Rb8 Kd7 32. a4 Rxc7 33. Rc6 bxa4 34. Ra8 Bb7 {It just gets worse and worse. I have mentally alrady lost, so I am just making moves now, waiting for the axe to fall.} 35. Rxc7+ Kxc7 36. Rh8 Bxd5 37. Rh3 Kb6 38. Ra3 Bb3 39. g3 a5 40. bxa5+ Kxa5 {No hope left now. I resign.}
