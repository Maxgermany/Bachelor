[Opening "QGD Slav (D15), 4.Nc3"]

1. d4 {Going for slav or queen pawn. I don't have much experience with it, so I would like to try it.} d5 2. c4 c6 {Black chooses a Slav} 3. Nf3 {Now, for some theory.....} Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bg5 {I slightly more aggressive variant. Could have played e3 right away.} Nbd7 {Other possibilities: h6, Be7, Bb4 or dxc4. } 6. e3 Qa5 {Was a bit surprised. This probably is also theory. Certainly this is played a lot. It's one of the benefits of Nd7 (or Be7) that the queen is not tied to defending f6 in order to prevent a doubled pawn on the f-file} 7. Nd2 {More attention needed on the queen side. Extra defending c4 and thus enabling a counter-thread (because Bb4 and dxc4 probably will be played).} Bb4 {Now b-pawn is about to get lost. Extra defense for c3 needed.} 8. Qc2 {Queen defending c3} dxc4 {As expected. Now it looks like it's best to trade in order to prevent too much of blacks pieces to come into play.} 9. Bxf6 Nxf6 10. Nxc4 {Now the extra knight comes in to stop the queen.} Qd5 {Queen is bugging. I want to get some pressure of my queen-side} 11. a3 Bxc3+ {Ok. I expected that. But how to recapture ? Queen or pawn? } 12. bxc3 {In order to keep the pawn-structure as strong as possible and at the same time creating a nice half-open file I choose to recapture with the pawn. } O-O {Smart.} 13. Ne5 {Without the Bishop, the knight would be lost. e5 is a nice post: it also allows for a defensive move (possibly after f6). Offensively this is a great spot. } b6 {I expect development of the Bishop along the H1-A8 diagonal and the attack of my centre by means of pawns.} 14. f3 {There is still some time. First I want to prevent the Knight from getting to e4.} c5 {Black attacks my knight-supporting pawn. Probably doesn't want it there.} 15. Rd1 {Would allow for some extra backup on this file.} b5 {What does black want: to close of the position or to develop his Bishop? } 16. Be2 {So I can castle. And an extra support over here for the f3 pawn. } a6 17. O-O {Now, just castle. That seems the best thing to do. The queen side is under attack, an extra rook there will help defending and hopefully allowing for some counterattacks.} c4 {Closing queen-side or maybe trying to create passed pawn there. I loose d3 as a square for my knight to withdraw to. g4 is not a good square for my knight, since it can be exchanged with black's knight. And since my horse seems better than his..... Now maybe f4 is an option. Making Bf3 possible. Will create a vulnerable e4 field though, but developing my Bishop which now seems to be doomed to hide behind my pawns.   } 18. f4 {So, chose to go for Bf3 in order to attack the h1-a8 diagonal.} Qe4 {Surprise for me! I expected not this move. It's bit too early for a queen-exchange in my opinion. That would leave me with the black horse on e4, supported by a pawn on f5 and increasing pressure on the queen-side. So I'll try and hold the weak e3-pawn and try to create counter-play along the h1-a8 diagonal.} 19. Qd2 {To keep e3, and play Bf3 later on.} Qd5 {Looks like black is aiming for the possession of e4 now. Bf3 will be met by Ne4, then Qc2 to counter-attack the e4-position. Then f5 will be played. All h1-a8 pressure-plans will be dead in the water. The Bishop will not be very useful then, but if I'm quick I just might be able to burst open the b-file or at least create a weak spot there. } 20. Bf3 {Alea iacta est. } Ne4 21. Qc2 Bb7 {Did not expect this move, but f5. I won't trade my bishop for his knight now. That would make his bishop too powerful. But since his bishop is now blocking his b-file, I can try to open up the queenside.  His rooks will now not be able to defend the b-file since the bishop is in the way.} 22. a4 {Now: I guess bxa4 or Rfc8. Bc6 would be a blunder (Nxc6;Qxc6;Bxd4) which would be very bad for black.} f5 {Ok. So now we'll fight for Q-side.} 23. Rda1 {Rook can't do much here at the moment but get in the way. Maybe I shouldn't have played it here in the first place. As a support to the a-pawn it's needed on this side of the board. } Rfb8 24. axb5 {Try to prevent black from becoming too powerful on the queen-side.  He might play a5 to create a passed pawn. But he'll have to guard it. My b-pawn is very vulnerable now, but can be defended. I also have to watch d3 (just as he needs to watch d7). He'll probably will play Qxb5. I can meet that witch Rfb1.} axb5 {Now initiating the exchange of the Rooks makes a1 weak. Black will dominate along the a8-h1 diagonal and the a-file. Because of his reorganisation of troops, the centre/kingside becomes interesting again. I'll try to get some pressure off by removing his Knight (my Bishop isn't doing much anyway).} 25. Bxe4 {So, remove the knight. If he recaptures by means of the pawn, he'll have a doubled pawn (weak) and if he recaptures by means of the Queen, exchanging Queens will favour white at this point. Well, maybe. Since the Bishop is still there. That might become too powerful. My knight has an excellent position, but isn't doing very much right now. I need to be sure blacks Bishop is "out of the game" before exchanging queens.} Qxe4 {A surprise! Expected fxe4! Now, do I want to keep the queens or not ?} 26. Qe2 {Guess it's best to keep the queen for now. Although the pressure on g2 isn't very pleasant.} Rbd8 {uld} 27. Rfd1 {Need extra protection on the d-pawn} Rd6 {I'm not sure, but this doesn't look like a good move for black. I would have understood a rook exchange or two. But not this. Or doubling the rooks on the a-file or something like that. } 28. Rxa8+ {By exchanging this rook I can get my rook on the a-file with chances of a last-line mate (look at my knight). Black's rook and bishop are not working together. } Bxa8 29. Ra1 {Black recaptured with the Bishop, as expected. Now I should be able to get the a-file. I'll still have to guard g2. Also the blocking of the black d-pawn by the Knight is important. Besides g2 there's also the thread of b4 being played. Ra1 at least buys some time to deal with that.} Bb7 30. Qf3 {Time has come to exchange the queens. That is, I expect black to start the trade. If black would withdraw to for example d5, black is bound to loose material.} g6 {Apparently, black is not interested in initiating the exchange. Even if there is a chance I will opt for the double-pawn. e5 is mine and will remain so, but I might be frightened to leave it. Black is not leaving all that to chance. His bishop will stand better at d4. At least, I assume he won't go for a double pawn.} 31. Qxe4 {Ok, I'll take it. His Bishop won't have such a crashing position. My wall of pawns is all on black squares. Subsequently, his blocking pawns are on the white fields, blocking his bishop. B4 is a move that I need to take into account.} Bxe4 32. Ra5 {So recapturing with the pawn. Attacking b-pawn seems a good idea. If defended by the bishop, the b-pawn will be mine. Bc6, Kxc6, Rxc6, Rxb5 and then black's c and e-pawn are weak. If defended by the rook at b6, the pawn will probably fall too. Defense by the rook on d5 will block black's bishop.} Rb6 33. Nd7 {Now I can attack the rook. If the rook moves to b7 I can move my rook to a8 for example. If then the king moves to g7 f.e. I can move the knight to c5 to fork rook and bishop. This would also allow for an attack on the e-pawn and/or h-pawn. } Rd6 {Black apparently wants to keep things going and actively defend his position so I won't get the upperhand.} 34. Ra7 {I will just try that: keep black locked in and find new target as much as possible. Kf6 will make h7 a target. Also the possibility is created to exchange the bishop. Don't know if I would want that, since it's only an obstacle for me in getting on the 7-rank AND the f-file at the same time. Of course I can hope for Bc6, Kf6+, Kh8 and Rxh7 mate. But I don't believe it will happen that easy.} Kf7 35. Nc5+ {The h-pawn is a target now. So Kg8 is to be expected. That makes it possible to move the King "up" and get a strong position on the K-side.} Kg8 36. Kf2 Bd5 37. Nd7 {Well, maybe now I'll get the chance to capture the h-pawn or put on more pressure on the king-side. I expect black to play h6. So I'll play h3. Not h4. Maybe I will want to play Kg3 Kh3 g3 Kh4 Kg5 and slowly move in there. Still a bit worried about b5-b4.} Kg7 38. g4 {This move I made because I now have a chance to break through on the kingside. } h6 {Hadn't really expected this move. } 39. Ne5+ {Now I can further attack the kingside. Black probably won't move the K to f6, since he'll get mated by Rf7. I.c. of Kf8 or Kh8 I''ll grab the pawn at g6+. So I guess he'll move Kg8. Then I play g5 first. hxg5. Then fxg5. That pawn has a great spot there. And there is the point to break through. On the other hand, my defense is not getting any stronger.} Kf6 40. Rf7# {....but one can get lucky!!!}
