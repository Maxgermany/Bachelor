[Opening "Caro-Kann (B18), classical variation"]

1. e4 {My usual opening which I play looking for a Sicilian or a Roy Lopez} c6 {Caro-Kann an opening I had little experience facing. It seems that the Caro-Kann was one of the most played openings alongside Indian Defences at the club.} 2. d4 {I may not have faced the Caro-Kann that often but I knew how to play it.} d5 3. Nc3 {I wasn't a fan of the exchange variation or the Panov-Botvinnik attack or the advance Caro-Kann} dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 {Not 4... Nf6 5. Nxf6+ exf6 or gxf6 which is what I had faced in my little experience of playing the Caro-Kann} 5. Bd3 {My Opening book suggested 5.Ng3} Qxd4 6. Qf3 Bxe4 {It took some time to decide whether to capture with the Bishop or the queen.} 7. Qxe4 {I decided to trade queens because with a 2 Bishops and the center looking rather open I thought my Bishop would be better than a knight and so I wanted to trade.} Qd8 {Interesting move because Not only does he lose a tempo when he is already one tempo down but he also loses his only developed piece and so loses two tempi. If he had have played Qxe4 Bxe4 Nf6 he could have made me lose a tempo.} 8. b3 {I planned on Castling Queenside and wanted my bishop on the long diagonal.} Nf6 {Now I had to decide whether to put my queen on e3 or f3.} 9. Qf3 {I decided f3 would be better because with him having no LSB I could control the light central squares and also with Bb2 and Ne2 I could gain some control of the dark squares. Also at e3 Nd5 attacks the Queen and forces me to move it again.} e6 {After I made Qf3 I expected e6 straight away I saw no other good move. g7 to try and fianchetto his bishop but It gave him no attack on the Light center squares.} 10. Ne2 {This was forced as Bb2 Bb4+ causes me to weaken the position of my DSB with c3 or lose the right to castle. However this does nothing to stop it but It means If I can play Bb2 before Bb4+ I can play Nc3} Be7 11. Bb2 O-O 12. O-O-O {This threatened Bxh7+ Nxh7 Rxd8 Rxd8 whichg means I lose a bishop and rook for a queen. However I would have liked to have Bishop and Rook rather than queen but It makes him think} Nbd7 {Now for a long time after this I was still thinking of a Classic Bishop Sac} 13. h4 {Starting a pawn storm} Qc7 14. g4 Ne5 {I was waiting for this} 15. Bxe5 Qxe5 {I lost my second Bishop and also control of the Dark center squares. This also threatened Ba3 Kb1 Qb2#} 16. c3 {With No DSB I didn't need to worry about this however It also meant I could try and regain control of the dark squares.} Nd5 17. Qe4 {This forced a queen exchange although I was a pawn down I thought with some good endgame results recently I had 3 wins and 1 draw in all end games I had recently including a win when a pawn down and a draw when a pawn down and so I was excited at that thought. I also thought that we would probably draw with an opposite coloured bishop ending.} Qxe4 18. Bxe4 Ba3+ 19. Kb1 {Know I played this hoping he would play Nxc3+ overlooking the knight because of the fork of king and rook.} Nf6 {attacking my bishop} 20. Bf3 Rad8 21. g5 {Continuing the pawn storm} Rxd1+ 22. Rxd1 {I wanted to Control the d-file and so I didn't capture with Rxd8 the move before} Nd5 {Still threating the fork and offeing an exchange of Knight and bishop} 23. Be4 {Now I played this trying to play f4 and strengthen my pawn storm} f5 {An en passant capture would have weakened my position and I didn't want to trade a bishop for a knight in an open position.} 24. Bc2 {No tawnting to block the f pawn however I expeceted f4 Just to stop my pawn advance} f4 25. c4 {Trying to force the knight to b6 or c7} Nb4 {This trapped his DSB however the effects of this move would only be felt later. Also offering the exchange of Knight for Bishop} 26. Be4 {I want to still threaten a g-h pawn attack supported with my bishop as well as attacking f3} f3 27. Ng1 {I attacked the pawn and was certain to win it} g6 {Trying to stop my pawn advance} 28. Rd7 {The power of a rook on the seventh rank} b6 {?? Lets me trap his DSB} 29. Rxa7 Rd8 {Threating mate on d1. However only after the event I realised I could have cpatured the bishop first and still no be checkmated. Although I fell safer I did it the other way because otherwise I would have lost A knight and so Didn't gain an extra piece} 30. Bxf3 {Protecting d1} Rd3 {I believe he forgot about the g1 Knight protecting f3 and wanted to trade bishops} 31. Rxa3 {I go up by 4 now} Rxf3 {?? this cost him the game} 32. Nxf3 Nd3 33. Ra6 Nxf2 34. Rxb6 {Black resigns Because I was going to win.  Lessons to be learned 1.) Don't accept exchanges of knights for Bishops in open positions. 2.) Don't trap your pieces on the sides of the board the become weaker as well as vulnerable to attack.}
