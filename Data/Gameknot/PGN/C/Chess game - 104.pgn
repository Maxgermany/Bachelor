1. e4 {As a first move, it's best to move either of your center pawns two spaces forwards, attacking the center of the board.} e5 {Black will usually respond with the same.} 2. Nf3 {At this point, both sides will want to develop their minor pieces, knights and bishops.  White's move develops the knight and attacks black's pawn at e5. } Nc6 {Black develops his/her knight, while protecting his/her pawn at d5.} 3. Bc4 {White develops his/her bishop.} Nf6 {Black develops his/her knight.} 4. Nc3 {White develops his/her knight as well.} Bb4 {Black develops bishop.} 5. O-O {White castles to protect his king.} O-O {Black castles.} 6. d3 {White moves pawn to allow bishop to move.} d6 {Black repeats.} 7. Bg5 {White develops bishop.} Be6 {Black does as well.  As you can see, both sides have attacked the center of the board, developed their pieces, and castled their kings.
