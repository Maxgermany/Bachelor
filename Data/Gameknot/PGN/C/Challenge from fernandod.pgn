1. e4 e5 2. d4 Qe7 3. Nf3 d6 4. dxe5 dxe5 5. Nc3 c6 6. Bc4 h6 7. Be3 Bg4 8. Na4 {Oh no, Pb5 forks the bishop and knight.  Very unpleasant for white.} b6 {Right piece, just not far enough.} 9. h3 Bxf3 10. gxf3 {Here white doubles his pawns.  Qxnf3 MIGHT have been better, except black ought to consider Qb4+ and have his pick of QxNa4 or QxBc4.  White could block the check with Nc3, leaving black white's white bishop.} Qb4+ {There it is.} 11. c3 {White protects the knight.} Qa5 {???  What was wrong with QxBc4?} 12. f4 b5 {Finally.} 13. Be2 bxa4 14. fxe5 Qxe5 15. Qxa4 Qxe4 {???  Ok, that was a HORRIBLE move.  Granted, white's rook is sitting pretty, with QxRh1+.  But what is stopping QxQe4+?  Black's queen is undefended.} 16. f3 {Holy s**t this was a horrible move!  NOW what stops QxQa4?  Free queen!} Qxe3 {???  Yes, there was a free bishop.  But there was a FREE QUEEN!  This is like stooping to pick up a shiny copper penny when just a few feet away a twenty dollar bill rests.} 17. Qxc6+ {Ok, that is NOT a free pawn.  I might have considered Qe4+, forcing a queen exchange here.} Nxc6 {}
