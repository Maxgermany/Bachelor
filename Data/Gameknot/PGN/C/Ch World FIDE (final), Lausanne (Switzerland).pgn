Karpov after realizing that Anand can start his kingside attack quicker is what triggered his next move. } Nf5 {A good plan, Karpov hones in on white's isolate pawn while at the same time improving the position of his knight. Also Karpov increases his central influence} 13. Qd3 Nxc3 {What is the plan! Karpov exchanges this knight in order to remove a defender of e4. } 14. bxc3 h6 {Karpov is acknowledging his current position and is defending rather than attacking. He plays ...h6 to prevent the white knight from invading via ...g5} 15. h5 {Alternative variation: 15. Bxf5  } Nd6 {What is the plan! By exchanging the dangerous Bishop black weakens his opponents attacking chance.} 16. Ne5 {Alternative variation: 16. Ba3 Nxe4  17. Bxf8 Nxf2 18. Kxf2 Qxf8 } Nxe4 17. Qxe4 Bxe5 {! } 18. dxe5 f5 {!

He has precise targets for his attack and complete justification to look to the future with optimism. White has no counter play, and the pawn weaknesses at a3,c3 and h5 make their defence extremely unpleasant. } 27. Rd4 Kh7 28. Bd2 Bd5 29. Qh3 b5 30. a4 bxa4 31. Rxa4 Rc4 {!  } 32. Rxc4 Bxc4 33.
