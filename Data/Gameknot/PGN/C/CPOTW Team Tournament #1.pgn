1. e4 {after our last game he told me he was gonna do a silicain and i looked forward to it} e5 {um this is not a silican!} 2. Bc4 Nf6 {he bluffed into not doing a silican, he was too scared as i was hungry for revenge} 3. Nc3 Bc5 4. Qf3 {figured i would pin the knight to mate} Nc6 5. Nge2 d6 6. a3 {i wanted to guard b4} O-O {well there goes that pin} 7. Nd5 Nxd5 8. Bxd5 {now the rook is pinned, like it was gonna move soon anyways} Qh4 9. Rf1 {i gave him the pawn on h2 so i could try and trap his queen} Qxh2 10. c3 {but first i gotta set things up} Ne7 11. d4 exd4 12. cxd4 Bb6 {good now the bishop is not aiming at anything at all now to focus on the queen} 13. Bf4 Qh4 {i probably should have castled here} 14. Rd1 Nxd5 15. exd5 Re8 {yeh castling was better} 16. g3 Bg4 17. gxh4 Bxf3 18. Be3 {trying to rescue the pinned piece} Ba5+ 19. b4 {go away i am busy!} Bb6 20. Rd3 {gonna pin the bishop instead of the knight} Bxd5 21. Nf4 {hopfully i can get this game back} Bc4 {darn he wins a rook} 22. Rc3 Bxf1 23. Kxf1 {now its 3 on 3 but i still do not like it} c6 24. a4 a5 25. b5 {hoping to get a square for my rook over there or my knight at d5} cxb5 26. axb5 a4 {i got d5} 27. Nd5 a3 {he gave me the bishop? i did not think the pawn was gonna make it} 28. Nxb6 a2 {ok gotta put the rook down there to stop it} 29. Rc1 a1=Q {this is the game deciding move right here, i can kill the queen and make the game knight and bishop vrs 2 rooks or i can kill the rook and make it rook and bishop vrs queen and rook. i know that killing the queen is the better move but i do not see any mates with one knight or bishop i also notice his king is still subject to back rank mate ideas, i need a rook for those to work so that made my decision} 30. Nxa8 Qxa8 {now i just gotta get the piece out of there} 31. Ke2 Qa5 {queens out now the rook gonna over up a free bishop} 32. Kd1 f5 {darn it he moved his pawn all my ideas are gone. probably should have killed the queen.}
