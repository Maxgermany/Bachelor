1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e5 {Black to play.} c5 {The game should continue 4. c3 Nc6 5. d4.} 4. Bb5+ {I have tried to emphasize in my lessons that this move is always bad against this pawn formation. At the very least the bishop is misplaced, and at worst White will trade his good bishop for Black's bad bishop.  } Bd7 5. Bxd7+ Nxd7 6. O-O Qc7 {Ganging up on the pawn. } 7. Re1 Ne7 8. c3 Nc6 {Just on basic principles, White should play 9. d4.} 9. d3 {According to computer analysis, Black has a slight advantage after 9... Be7 10. Na3 O-O 11. d4 Rfc8. } Ndxe5 {Looks natural, but for reasons we shall soon seen, the computer doesn't prefer this move.  } 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. Bf4 Bd6 12. Bxe5 Bxe5 {I wonder how many people would now see 13. Qh5 Bf4 14. Rxe6+ Kf8 15. Re2 g6 16. Qxd5 Rd8 17. Qf3 Bxh2+ 18. Kf1 Bf4 19. Nd2 equal.  If 19. g3 Bg5 with a miniscule advantage for Black.} 13. g3 {White misses the key move, so he is now losing.  } O-O 14. f4 Bd6 {Or 14... Bf6. } 15. Nd2 {How does Black make progress? } b5 {Black expands on the Queenside, gaining space with a chance of provoking a weakness in the White pawns. } 16. Nf3 b4 {This is natural because Black will have more space on the Queenside and be stronger there.} 17. cxb4 cxb4 {If 18. Rc1 Qb6+ (Better than  18... Qa5 19. Qc2) 19. Kg2 (19. d4 Rfc8) 19... Rfc8 with a strong advantage, probably due the pawn structure.  Or if 18. Qd2 Black is still technically winning after 18... Rfc8 19. Rec1 Qa5. Suppose play were to continue 20. Rc2 g6 Black will make progress by advancing pawns, which is a little better than 20... Rc5 21. Rxc5 Qxc5+ 22. d4 Qc4 23. b3 Qa6 24. Rc1 Rc8 25. Rc2. } 18. b3 { } Rfc8 {If 19. Rc1 Black can play 19... Qa5 or 19... Qb6+ with a better position.} 19. d4 Qc2 {There are a lot of moves that are good here, but this simple invasion into White's territory is winning.  If 20. Rc1 Qxa2 or after 20. Re2 Qxd1+ 21. Rxd1 Rc3 22. Kf2 Rac8 23. Rdd2 and Black will have to push pawns, such on the A and G files, to make progress. } 20. Qxc2 Rxc2 {This should be a win. } 21. Rec1 Rac8 22. Rxc2 Rxc2 23. Kf1 Kf8 24. Ke1 Ke7 25. Nd2 Bc7 {Relocating the bishop to attack d4.} 26. Kd1 Rc3 {If 27. Rc1 Rxc1+ 28. Kxc1 Kf6 and Black wins by invading with his King. 29. Kd1 Kf5 30. Ke2 Bb6 31. Nf3 f6 32. Ke3 Kg4 33. Kf2 Kh3 34. Kg1 h6 35. Kh1 g5 36. fxg5 hxg5.} 27. Ke2 Bb6 28. Nf3 Rc2+ {I assumed incorrectly that having a rook on the 7nth rank by itself would be enough to win, but this proved to not be true.} 29. Kd3 Rf2 30. Ke3 Rg2 31. Kd3 {Moving the rook around isn't making any progress, so Black has to try something different ... } f6 32. Ke3 Kd6 33. Kd3 {Now for the key two moves ... } h6 34. Ke3 g5 {Otherwise, how does Black make progress? } 35. fxg5 hxg5 {If 36. Ng1 Rxh2.  If 36. Rd1 g4 37. Ng1 Rxa2.} 36. g4 {Throws away a pawn, but White was going to lose a pawn anyway.  } Rxg4 37. Rd1 e5 {The pin on the pawn is devastating. } 38. Rd2 Bxd4+ 39. Nxd4 Rxd4 {If 40. Rc2 Rh4 41. Rc8 Rxh2 42. Rf8 Ke6.} 40. Rxd4 {White throws away any small chance he would have had for a draw.  } exd4+ 41. Kxd4 {Black to play.} f5 {Clearly the best move. } 42. h3 f4 43. Kd3 Ke5 44. Ke2 Kd4 {Not the most accurate, but it doesn't matter.  Faster would be 44... Ke4 45. Kf2 d4 46. Ke2 d3+ 47. Kd2 f3 48. Ke1 Ke3 49. Kd1 f2 50. Kc1 f1=Q+ 51. Kb2 Qe2+ 52. Kb1 (52. Kc1 Qc2#) 52... d2. } 45. Kf3 Kc3 46. Kg4 {There isn't much point to playing this out, but White chooses to continue.} d4 47. Kxg5 f3 {Strongest. } 48. h4 f2 49. h5 f1=Q 50. h6 {As long as Black doesn't throw away his queen, almost any move will work here. } Qf7 {White resigns. }
