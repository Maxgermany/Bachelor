1. d4 {i'm trying to learn a new opening .... i used to always play 1.e4 } Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 b6 6. Nc3 Na6 7. Bg5 d6 8. e4 Nc7 9. Nb5 {i offer an exchange of my knight because i love the position of my advanced pawns and his knights are attacking them} Be7 10. Nxc7+ Qxc7 {forced... but i probably wasted tempo... i'd rather he took my knight first} 11. Bb5+ Bd7 {the move i expceted.. i hoped he would trade white bishops because i plan to place my pawns on the white spaces leaving him with a dark bishop and pawns on the dark spaces} 12. Bxd7+ Qxd7 13. Qe2 {i feel like i need some more defence for my paws so i moved my queen even though i plan to castle kingside.... also i'm not yet sure if i want to trade my dark squared bishop for his knight although i am strongly considering it.... Additionally this move keeps his queen off the A6-F1 diagonal for now} O-O 14. O-O {i'd say we have a fairly similar position here ..... perhaps i have a very slight edge with my pawns being more advanced} Rae8 {i see that he is planning to attack along the half open e file } 15. Bxf6 {i've decided for sure that i want to place my pawns on the light squares now... i hope that his pawns will limit the effectiveness of that dark bishop } Bxf6 16. Rab1 {so i can move my b pawn or my queen without losing material} Qg4 {this move doesn't particularly bother me as i was planning on supporting my e pawn with my rook as well anyways} 17. Rfe1 Qg6 18. Qd3 {this gives me a discovered attack on his queen, protects my knight and both pawns and moves my queen to a better location assuming he is planning to double his rooks on the e file} Re7 19. Nd2 Bd4 {this move prevents f3 for now} 20. Nf3 {his pieces seem more active than mine so at this point i would be happy with a draw if he offered one even though i have the better minor piece} Bf6 21. b3 {reducing the effectiveness of his dark bishop even more as less and less of my pieces occupy dark squares} Rfe8 {he finally doubles his rooks} 22. Nd2 Bg5 {not a bad move as it threatens to remove my knight from defending e4} 23. f3 Bf4 {i don't see why he doesn't just take the knight as his bishop is getting less and less effective.... all his major pieces now attack my e4 pawn.... and i'm on the defensive} 24. Re2 Qh6 25. h3 Re7e5 26. Rb2 Rg5 {a common trap where he attempts to take the H pawn by pinning its defender to my king} 27. Kf1 {avoided.... and now i only have 2 pieces on dark squares Also, his attack on E4 isn't as strong anymore } Qh4 {it seems to me that he is being over agressive } 28. Nc4 {so i go on the attack... this move keeps his bishop on the b8-h2 diagonal} f5 {this move was not what i expected... it appears he is trying to isolate my d pawn from my chain...} 29. exf5 {i capture to avoid moving the pawns in front of my king and to discover an attack on his rook that is acting as the lone defender for his king} Rf8 30. Re6 {now i'm on the attack and his pieces are limited by my pawn on f5} Qg3 {protects the pawn on d6..... but i have bigger plans than trying to gain 1 pawn!} 31. Qe4 {i now control the e file} Rgxf5 {I don't mind the loss of the pawn as i have more than sufficient compensation in position and still even material} 32. Re8 {i was hoping for RxR and still wasn't sure if i could win although it was looking more and more like at least a draw} Be5 {this move was unexpected.... Attacks my rook on B2 and cutts my rook on E8 off from my queen} 33. Qxf5 {i take advantage of the pin on the f8 rook to take the one that is more threatening to me and to get my queen on the other side of that bishop } Rxe8 {the only logical move} 34. Re2 {Re2!! now i have his bishop pinned on e5} g6 {he obviously doesn't like the position of my queen.... } 35. Qd7 {Qd7! attacking the rook and the 3 pawns at the bases of his chains} Kf8 {Kf8?? when he makes this move i think it loses the game although the game may have been lost for black with my previous move..... because..... } 36. Nxd6 {Nxd6! .... while the bishop is pinned i eliminate the piece that it defends, one of its defenders, and attack another of its defenders, gaining momentum and material.... i also threaten mate with Qf7 or if Bxd6, Rxe8} Re7 {this move seems like a good responce until you consider how white will likely respond to it.... 37.Qd8 and the rook is lost black has only two options... 37...Kg7 38.Qxe7 (Kh6 or Kg8 or Kh8), 39.Qxe5 leaving white a pawn minor piece and a rook up and 37... Re8 38 Qxe8 Kg7 39 Qxe5 Qxe5 40.Rxe5 leaving white a pawn, rook and minor piece up.... Here my opponent graciously resigned.... thanks for the game mdmseattle} 37. Qd8+ {(wins the rook and bishop)}
