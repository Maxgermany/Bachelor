1. c4 e5 2. Nf3 e4 3. Nd4 Bc5 4. Nb3 {This is the only time you'll see me playing Nb3 instead of Nc2 in this opening variation, only when the Black Bishop posts at c5. Otherwise, I prefer to keep my Knight a step closer to the center. However, the gain of tempo in this case justifies the temporary misplacing of the Knight.} Bd6 {Huh. That's interesting. I'm thinking now that I'll see ...c6 real soon.} 5. Nc3 Qe7 6. g3 Nf6 7. Bg2 c6 {Yep.} 8. O-O O-O 9. d4 Re8 10. e3 Bc7 11. Nd2 d5 12. b3 {White is content to develop and maintain the integrity of his center pawns.} Ng4 {What's the plan, Stan? The text blunders a pair of pawns.} 13. cxd5 cxd5 14. Nxd5 Qd6 15. Nxc7 Qxc7 16. Nxe4 {Black is busted. The game is basically over already, but the second player slogs grimly on - thankfully, because the reader will be treated to a snappy piece of drama in a little while - the only thing that made this game worth annotating.} Qb6 17. Bb2 Qh6 18. h4 Bf5 19. Ng5 f6 20. Nf7 {This is it. It doesn't win or anything - or shouldn't; it just makes board-life a little more interesting. On 20. ...Qg6 I would have simply played 21. Nd6 and then exchanged on f5.} Kxf7 21. Bd5+ Kf8 {Ooooooh! Black should have played 21. ...Be6  22. Be6 Re6  23. Qg4, with White still enjoying the two pawns in-hand. Now I see a vision of mayhem behind my eyelids.} 22. Ba3+ Re7 23. Bxb7 {The very least White can do now is win a double-Exchange. At this moment I was thinking to myself, "I'll bet this guy hasn't been abused in 23 moves like this since the last time he played an Expert."} Nd7 24. Bxa8 Ke8 25. Bxe7 Kxe7 26. Bf3 Qg6 27. Rc1 Nh6 28. Qd2 Be4 29. Qb4+ Kf7 30. Rc7 Qf5 31. Bxe4 Qxe4 32. Rxd7+ Kg6 33. Qe7 Qxe7 34. Rxe7 a5 {It has to be Black's ego that makes him play on, a Rook, an Exchange, and 3 pawns down.} 35. Rc1 Nf5 36. Ra7 {And Black's time ran out.}
