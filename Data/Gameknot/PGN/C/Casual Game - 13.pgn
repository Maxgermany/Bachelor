[Opening "Grob (A00), Fritz gambit"]

1. g4 {Grob was not yet born, but his precursor decides on this unusual move.} d5 {The usual response, advancing a central Pawn and opening a line for the QB.} 2. Bg2 {The Pawn does not yet need to be defended.} Bxg4 {Bowlby goes Pawn-snatching, usually not a good idea in the opening.} 3. c4 {Bloodgood attempts to divert Bowlby's QP.} c6 {Bowlby decides that having snatched one Pawn, discretion is the better part of valor.} 4. cxd5 {Bloodgood initiates the exchange...} cxd5 {...and Bowlby completes it.} 5. Qb3 {Bloodgood sets a subtle trap.} e6 {Bowlby falls into it. The correct move was 5...B-Q2.} 6. Qa4+ {Double attack. Bowlby resigns, as the loose Bishop falls.}
