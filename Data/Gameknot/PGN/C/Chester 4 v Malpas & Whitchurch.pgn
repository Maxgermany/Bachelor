[Opening "Nimzo-Indian (E43), Fischer variation"]

1. d4 {So I start conventionally. } Nf6 {A normal developing move, preventing e2-e4} 2. c4 {This is the normal move in this position.} e6 {Another normal move, opening a diagonal for his bishop.} 3. Nc3 {So I continue to develop, threatening e2-e4, with a big pawn centre.} Bb4 {This is now a Nimzo-Indian defence.} 4. e3 {I play the main line.} b6 {This is called the Fischer Variation, as it was played occasionally by the late World Chess Champion, Bobby Fischer in his youth. In fact he was more famous for playing the King's Indian or Gruenfeld as black against 1. d4. } 5. Bd3 {So I continue my development, threatening e3-e4 again.} Bb7 {He develops.} 6. f3 {This seems to me a very natural move, blunting the Bb7 and preparing e3-e4 at some stage.} d5 {He tries to block e3-e4. I was quite happy to see this move. if ever he doubles my c pawns with Bb4xc3, I can always undouble them with c4xd5.} 7. Nge2 {So I continue my development.} Nbd7 {He develops his knight to a fairly logical square.} 8. a3 {Again, this seems like a logical follow-up to my last move.} Bd6 {Instead of exchanging, he retreats, but I think this square is inferior, because if I decide to advance with b2-b4 and c4-c5 I will gain a tempo by attacking his bishop, or if I decide to advance in the centre, e3-e4 will threaten e4-e5 forking his bishop or knight. I think he would have been better to retreat to e7, or to exchange bishop for knight. Now I can't advance in the centre immediately, because he has a nasty queen check on h4, for instance 9.	e4? dxe4 10. fxe4 Nxe4 11. Nxe4	Bxe4 12. Bxe4 Qh4+ followed by taking the bishop on e4.} 9. O-O {So I castle instead.} O-O {And so does he.} 10. e4 {I advance in the centre, but with the gift of hindsight, I think this may be premature. Maybe Kh1 is better, so that his bishop can't go to c5 with check, although having said that, my computer likes this move!} dxe4 {So he takes. My computer likes the other take, dxc4, but dxe4 seems quite natural to me too!} 11. fxe4 {I take back.} e5 {He prevents the fork. I don't want my e pawn to become isolated, and there is only one way to prevent that....} 12. d5 {And this is this move, but it allows black some activity.} Bc5+ {This check for instance - this is why I wondered after the match maybe I should have played 10. Kh1 instead - have you any thoughts dear reader?} 13. Kh1 {this move is forced.} Ng4 {Now he is threatening Nf2 forking my king and queen.} 14. Qe1 {So this move is virtually forced. Now the move I was afraid of him playing is Be3. I think exchanging dark squared bishops is good for him. Although his bishop sits on a good square now, it can be forced off that square with b2-b4. For that reason, the move a7-a5 also comes to mind. However, although is it undeveloped at c1, my Bc1 can be considered my "good" bishop. it can move unhampered by my pawns. His Bc5 is potentially a "bad" bishop, blocked in by his pawns. To me, exchanging bishops makes a lot of sense. I was quite glad to see that my computer agrees with me too!} Bc8 {Not sure of the point of this move - I was delighted that he played it.} 15. Rf3 {He is not going to get a chance to exchange on e3 now! My computer prefers Qg3 - which I was considering - with the same aim of preventing him from playing Be3.} Be7 {This is again, heading in the wrong direction! a7-a5 makes more of a fight of it!} 16. h3 {So I drive his knight back.} Ngf6 {It drops back - notice how my Bc1 prevents it from going back to h6. Although black is very passive now, I still have to be careful, so instance, Bc1-g5? is answered by Nxd5! winning a pawn for black.} 17. Bd2 {So I develop my bishop to this square instead, intending to advance on the queen-side.} Re8 {This doesn't do much.} 18. b4 {So I advance.} Nf8 {Knight drops back. Black is incredibly passive.} 19. Rf1 {I want to play c4-c5.} Ng6 {Knight pops out again!} 20. Qf2 {Now I am threatening c4-c5} c5 {Which he stops.} 21. b5 {Now I have a logical plan of attack on the queen-side.} Bd7 {He continues these manoeuvres which don't achieve much.} 22. a4 {So I carry on with my plan.} Qc8 {He actually has a threat here, Bxh3} 23. Kh2 {So I put a stop to that. I was xpecting Bg4 here, and I can't take it without my king and queen being forked. But of course I don't have to take, I was thinking of just moving my Ne2 in reply - probably to g2. I don't want to allow exchanges while he is so badly cramped.} Qd8 {So he starts shuffling pieces again.} 24. Ra3 {And I continue wth my plan.} Rf8 {More shuffling.} 25. Rfa1 {Preparing a4-a5} Nh5 {I am not sure this achieves much either.} 26. a5 {So I just carry one.} bxa5 {He takes.} 27. Ra3xa5 {I take. His pawn on a7 is very weak now. I was rather expecting Qc7 now.} f5 {But instead he lashes out on the king-side.} 28. exf5 {I just take.} Nh4 {Knight comes in.} 29. g4 {I protect my pawn} Qc7 {He threatens a discovered checks with e5-e4} 30. Be4 {So I block his e pawn.} Nxf5 {He now sacrifices a knight.} 31. gxf5 {S I take. } Bxf5 {He sacrifices a bishop.} 32. Bxf5 {I take back. I was thinking that Kh8 was probably the best move for him, so that i don't have Bf5-e6 check. I think he can then follow it up with g7-g6 and get back a piece. I am still a piece up, but it is better than the game continuation.} Rf6 {He prepares to double his rook, but....} 33. Ne4 {I can just attack the rook, and Rf7 can be met by either Bxh7 check, or even better, Be6} Rff8 {So the rook drops back.} 34. Qf3 {And he resigns. Many thanks for reading. Please rate it on the star system, and add a comment or two. Until next time dear reader!}
