1. e4 {Here is an example of a chess game where I easily could have won but I just messed around thinking the game would be easy and resulted in getting checkmated.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Up till now it was quite a usual beginning game.} 4. a3 {My opponent did a move that many people do but I wouldn't do myself.} Nf6 5. b4 Bd6 {I obviously retreated my bishop.} 6. Nc3 Nd4 7. Ng5 {The game now began to get more complicated.} O-O 8. Nxf7 {Oooh, my opponent made a tactical mistake as a bishop and a knight is stronger than a rook and a pawn- but that can be argued.} Rxf7 9. Bxf7+ Kxf7 10. d3 Kg8 11. O-O Be7 12. Bb2 d5 {For a while nothing interesting happened in the game.} 13. exd5 Nxd5 14. Nxd5 Qxd5 {Now I had total control of the centre.} 15. c4 Qc6 16. Qh5 {It was my opponent's turn to be attackive.} Bf6 17. b5 Qc5 18. Bxd4 Qxd4 {I fell for his trick.} 19. Qe8# {I noticed this just as I submitted my move but by then it was too late.}
