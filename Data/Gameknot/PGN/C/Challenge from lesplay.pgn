[Opening "Danish gambit (C21), Collijn defence"]

1. e4 {White has been on attack most of the time (except from move 15t to 20) but black defended very well and white had little occasions to make the difference and at risk, the draw is logical.} e5 2. d4 {Central game} exd4 {Black takes} 3. c3 {Danish gambit...} dxc3 {...accepted} 4. Nxc3 {I like this position for white : it gives open lines and diagonals and many attacking possibilities which is worth the pawn late.} Nc6 {Most common and natural move} 5. Nf3 {Now white has to develop quickly to take profit of his position and compensate the late in material} d6 6. Bc4 {the common move in this opening} Nf6 {menacing e4 but the weak f7 pawn will now be white's aim} 7. Qb3 {aiming at f7} Be6 {protecting f7} 8. Bxe6 {White trades} fxe6 9. Qxe6+ {material is now equal} Qe7 {efficient protection} 10. Ng5 {protecting the queen} Qxe6 {Black trades} 11. Nxe6 {Now white has lost one move in developpement but black will have trouble to castle} Rc8 {Protecting the c7 pawn} 12. Nxf8 {So that black cannot castle anylonger} Rxf8 {Black cannot castle anylonger, has an unsafe king but rook on a semi open file in reward and developpement advance} 13. O-O {King in safe, rook on the f file. The f pawn can be pushed on f3 without danger because black has no more piece available to attack via b8-g1} Ne5 {knight on the center, menacing d3} 14. Rd1 {Rook on the semi-open file, preventing 15. Nd3 but the ideal place for this rook was e1. Black has the initiative} b6 {Black's plan seems to advance pawns on the queenside where he has the majority. Drawback : it doesn't secure the king.} 15. Bf4 {White wants to conquier the center and directly menace the black king.} Rd8 {defending the d file.} 16. Rac1 {Second rook on the semi-open c file but it's a mistake. 16. Nb5 with fork attack on black's a anc c pawn would have been better.} Kf7 {Joining the rooks} 17. f3 {Protecting e4, so that white can move the c knight} c6 {Good move, covering the important d5 square} 18. Ne2 {To free the c file for the rook, oblige black to protect c6and enable a further Nd4} c5 {advancing on the queenside, taking control of the d4 square, preventing 19. Rxc6} 19. Nc3 {Back to his place, white's 18th move was fruitless.} Rd7 {To double the rooks on the central file.} 20. Bxe5 {So that black gets an isolated pawn. But  20. Nb5 could have been better, forcing 20. ... Rd8 for 21. Bg5, menacing 22. f4. But it was unsure and white chooses the safest line, giving a little advantage without taking risk (therefore, nearing the draw).} dxe5 21. Rxd7+ {Trading the rooks} Nxd7 22. Rd1 {Now white has taken the control of the open d file and black has an isolated pawn. Advantage white but not enough to win.} Nf6 {Away from the d rook trajectory} 23. Nb5 {Menacing a√® and preparing an attack toward the black king.} Ra8 {Rook on protection} 24. g4 {White tries an attack on the kingside where he has the majority} g5 {... attack blocked} 25. Nd6+ {to set the knight on f5} Ke7 26. Nf5+ {A good place for the knight : secured, it cannot be fired by a pawn. It's central (can quickly come on the queenside n case if black decides to attack there, using his pawn majority).} Kf7 {king in safe} 27. Nd6+ {second time on the same position.} Kg6 {Black proposes a draw, accepted.}
