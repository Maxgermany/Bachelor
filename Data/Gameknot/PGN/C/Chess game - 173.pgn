[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Smith-Morra gambit, Chicago defence"]

1. e4 c5 {The Sicilian opening} 2. d4 {The variation I used to play: Smith-Morra gambit.} cxd4 {accepted} 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 g6 {He wants to fianchetto his bisschop. Is this still book?} 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Qb3 {trying to build up some pressure on f7.} Nf6 {preparing for O-O} 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Ng5 {three pieces attacking f7!} e6 {easily dealt with the thread} 9. Nb5 {trying to force something on the queenside and 'blocking' the queen, when she moves I can play Nc7 winning the rook! As we I can play Nd6 which attacks f7 again.} Nc6 10. Qh3 {attacking h7, but it isn't very effective due to the knight on f6.} a6 {pushing my knight away.} 11. Nc3 {As I think about it now, I would've prefered Nd6 as I mention before} h5 {I count this a mistake as it weakens the kingside and the mate on h7 was allready protected by the knight} 12. Bf4 {developing my DSB, aiming for d6 again.} b5 {pushing my LSB away} 13. e5 {attacking his 'annoying' f6 knight.} bxc4 14. exf6 {he trades, he now has the bisschop pair but he weakened his kingside.} Qxf6 15. g4 {trying to trade of pawns, however, it costs me a bisschop, something I missed...} Qxf4 16. Nce4 {protecting my threatened knight and putting more pressure on the kingside.} d5 {attacking my knight!} 17. gxh5 {trading of pawns at the cost of another minor piece...} dxe4 18. Rg1 {protecting my knight and taking the halfopen g-file} Bxb2 {attacking my rook} 19. hxg6 {threatens mate!} Bc3+ 20. Kf1 {trying to bring my king to safety, but as I saw later on I just could've taken his bisschop...} Kg7 {stopping the mate threat, however I can now trade of his last kingside pawn.} 21. gxf7 Rh8 {He gives me even more advantage when I would take the bisschop and now I didn't miss it} 22. Qxc3+ Qf6 {and now my check deals the final blow} 23. Nxe4+ {winning the queen for sure! thx for reading, pls rate and comment!}
