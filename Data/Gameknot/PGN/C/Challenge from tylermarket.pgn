[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {My first move will be the standard king's pawn opening, a favorite for most intermediate chess players.} e5 {The opponent defends the center by copying my move, so far this seems like a normal chess game.} 2. Nf3 {I now attack his pawn with my knight, of course we're going to expect our oponent to defend it.} d6 {which he does, with his pawn, so far so good.} 3. Nc3 {I now move up my other knight, to protect my pawn but to also add to my evil plan.} b6 {The opponent moves the b7 pawn, probably for some bishop attacks.} 4. Bc4 {I move my bishop to c4, everything is in place now, let's see how my opponent reacts.} Bg4 {Exactly how I planned.  In his mind he made a good move because if I try to attack the bishop I'll mess up my castling side, or I could end up having a double pawn.} 5. Nxe5 {I make the "wrong move" and give up my queen, hoping that he takes her.} Bxd1 {He did, like expected, and now I move in for the kill, it's mate in 2.} 6. Bxf7+ {check, the king cannot attack the bishop because it is guarded by the knight.} Ke7 {the king moves to the only space available.} 7. Nd5# {checkmate, the king is trapped.  This is the famous queen sacrifice/fools mate.  }
