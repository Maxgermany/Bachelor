1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e3 e6 4. Bd3 c5 5. b3 Nc6 6. O-O Bd6 7. Bb2 O-O {This was the starting position in the Colle-Zuckertort match. } 8. Nbd2 {This move seems good. Bringing the knight in to the game is possibly slightly better than the alternative moves, which to my mind would be the highly aggressive 8. Ne5, or the docile 8. a3. } Qc7 {Putting pressure on the most critical diagonal, and at also down the vulnerable c-file. } 9. c4 cxd4 {Opening up seemed the only way forward. } 10. exd4 Nb4 {Stopping this move would have been the main point of an early 8. a3 from white. I really hoped Muff would let me trade with his bishop. } 11. Bb1 {... but understandably he had other plans for his bishop!} dxc4 12. bxc4 {Less sure about this. I did not really like the center-controlling pawns, but I found nothing better to do. } Bf4 {I had to get away from pawn onslaught somehow! (... Be7 is of coures an alternative, but it looks more passive)} 13. a3 Nc6 {A slight loss of self esteem for my knight. } 14. Qc2 Bxd2 {The bishop might have been a valuable resource, but this knight was just too annoying!} 15. Qxd2 Na5 {The knight makes another attempt ... may be wiser this time. The there is a double threat in this move: (1) the pawn on c4 is hanging, and (2) there is the nice fork on b3. } 16. Ne5 Nb3 {The pawn decoy worked!} 17. Qc2 Nxa1 {The knight happily trades its life for the life of a rook!} 18. Bxa1 Qe7 {To protect the knight. Otherwise 19. Ng4 would be crushing (given the mate threat on h7).} 19. Ng4 g6 {Protecting from the nest. } 20. Nh6+ Kg7 {The only option here. Kh1 would have lost the knight due to d5 and Ng4. } 21. Qd2 Qxa3 {I can resist anything ... except temptations!} 22. Bb2 Qe7 23. d5 exd5 24. g4 {This is a truly brilliant move, which I had missed completely! It immediately puts my poor pinned knight in danger, and I cannot even get out of the pin!} d4 {I thought long about what to do ... and then I found d4!} 25. Qxd4 {This surprised me, as it would let me take the white knight. The idea behind d4 was "you pin me, I pin you". That is, if Muff took with the bishop, I would slide my rook over to d8! } Kxh6 26. g5+ {g5+! Now I faced another tough decision, whether to take or not to take. And then of course ...} Kxg5 {... I take!} 27. Qd2+ {Good move!} Kh5 28. Re1 Qd8 29. Re5+ Bf5 30. Qe3 {? e2 was possibly better. } Qd1+ 31. Kg2 Ng4 {In hindsight, this was a mistake. Qg4 was possibly better. } 32. Qh3+ Kg5 {I thought my king was rather safe at this point ...} 33. f4+ {... which I now doubted. Another brilliant move from my opponent. Take or not to take? ... } Kxf4 {... as usual, take!} 34. Qg3+ {!} Kg5 35. h4+ {... alternatively h3. } Kh5 36. Qf4 {Threatening checkmate on g5!} Qd8 {I was now up 8 points, and thought I could ward off the death treat from behind. This move was probably my biggest mistake yet!} 37. Bxf5 {37. Bxf5!! Taking with the rook would not have been good, in fact quite bad for black!} Nxe5 38. Bc1 {Brilliant move! Rather than taking my knight, as I was sure he would do, my opponent put up annother death threat! This time on h6. } g5 {The only possible response. } 39. hxg5 {hxg5! The right choice! Now there is a yet a new mate threat. This time by Qh2. When pressured like this, there is only one gentlemany thing to do ...} Qd4 {... to sacrifice his queen! (There is no other way to get out of the check mate threat).} 40. Qxd4 {At this point, rather ironically, we reached material equality! But as there was no way ahead to ward of future checkmates, I resigned! I am thankful to my brilliant opponent for an amazing game - a victory well deserved!}
