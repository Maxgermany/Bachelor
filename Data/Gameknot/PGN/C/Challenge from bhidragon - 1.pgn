1. d4 {I wasn't sure what ION would do, but he decides on the QPO.} Nf6 {I had anticipated the QPG since I would've answered with 1...d5.  Of course, I'd be prepared for the QG, as then, I'd respond with the Slav Defense.} 2. c4 {Allowing ION to play Nc3 without blocking the c pawn.} e6 {Preparing to develop his Bf8.  And, this gives Joe a very comfortable position since it blends in with why Susan really likes the French Defense.} 3. g3 {I also would've played this fianchetto myself.  My thinking is that, in general, I like those long diagonals for one of my B's.} c5 {Joe wants to exchange.} 4. Nf3 {And, I think that ION is right not to go right into it but delay it, similar to what's in the annotation with Jack.} cxd4 5. Nxd4 d5 {I am not sure why Joe played this.  I would've done it to tie down white's Nd4 here, as my idea would be to take on c4.} 6. Bg2 {Having said that, this foils the plan in some shape or form.  I'm not sure how since I'd be greedy here.} e5 {I would've developed the Bf8, but for the wrong reason, as well, I like this move.  I just like to think of that tempo gain, which is really not enough of a reason that I'd consider a move.  But, my mind's thinking about what else Joe has in mind.} 7. Nf3 d4 {It was a nice pawn chain that Joe now has.  But, what ION plays next is what I'd consider since I like the idea of castling..} 8. O-O {But, after a long thought, I would've quickplayed 8.Nxe5.  There is, however, something about it that doesn't work.  I'm just not sure what would make that a blunder since I don't see an immediate mate or loss of material, right afterwards.  } Nc6 {Although I'd develop the DSB, this would strongly come into consideration.} 9. e3 {Although I wouldn't have even considered this move, I like the idea behind it.  As ION is threatening to break right through in the center which is a very good strategy, as Ken previously pointed out.} Be7 {Continuing with his development and preparing to castle.  But, ION will exchange first.} 10. exd4 exd4 11. Bf4 {Continuing his development, and I believe, putting some pressure on Joe's Q side.  Having said that, the only other candidate move that I would've taken into consideration would be 11.Nd2  But, after giving it some thought, this is also what I would've played.} O-O {And, this is also what I would've done.} 12. Ne5 {Wanting to get the Nc6 off of his back.  But, as with me, Joe also refuses in an interesting way, as he'll attack b2.  Although I realized that it is, as in many cases, a poisoned pawn since black won't take.} Qb6 13. Re1 Be6 {Instead, Joe goes right after c4.  } 14. Qb3 {Which ION protects.} Bb4 {So, Joe goes after the R, and once ION protects, black will exchange right away.} 15. Nd2 Nxe5 16. Rxe5 Nd7 {But, Joe doesn't like ION's R there.  On the other hand, after retreating, we get into another series of exchanges.  I'm not exactly sure why it's necessary since, when all is said and done, white will be up the equivalent to a piece for pawn which is to ION's advantage.} 17. Rb5 Qxb5 18. cxb5 Bxb3 19. Nxb3 Rad8 {I'm not sure, exactly, what goes into this, but one thing is for certain.  Joe is centralizing one of his R's.  But, it'll allow ION to win another pawn.  Being, as cautious as, I am, I would've played 19...d3, but I'm sure there's something I'm missing which would be even worse for black.} 20. Nxd4 Nc5 {I see what it is since Joe unleashes the masked battery against the N, but ION was ready for this, as shown on his next move.} 21. Be3 Rd7 {Preparing to double up on one file which is why ION goes on the attack which will force liquidation.  My first thought was 22...Ba5?? since that's more then likely what I would've done.  And, I have overlooked forks like 23.b4, afterwards.} 22. a3 Bd2 23. Bxd2 Rxd4 24. Be3 {Joe pins, and as black, I would feel overwhelmed here.  Not surprisingly, Joe handles this much better then I would have.} Rc4 25. Bd5 {ION has more attacks up his sleeve here.  In fact, his attack will allow ION to rewin another pawn.} Rc2 {This time b2 is not poisoned since ION will protect with a counterattack.} 26. b4 Nd3 27. Bxb7 Rc7 {Going right after the LSB, as I would.  But, what ION plays next is also how I would counterattack.  Of course, there's a lot more going on then I realize, but I'm just annotating as need be.} 28. Be4 Rd7 29. Rd1 {This is a similar pattern to what I had with Ron.  When you attack, the other defend.  Then, you reattack, and he defends again.  And, that pattern repeats.} Ne5 {This is interesting, as now, we get into the last series of exchanges.  But, it's going to be problematic for Joe since ION is bound to win a pawn again.  This time, it's without compensation.} 30. Rxd7 Nxd7 31. Bxa7 Re8 {I am not sure why Joe played, but this will allow ION to pin.  And, when he does, black will resign.  The reason being is that even if black breaks it with 32...Rd8, white will be able to liquidate.  But, there's more because white has 3 dangerous passed pawns.  At least 2 of them are unstoppable.  So, no matter what black plays next, white can and will promote which will, at the very least, lose a R.  And, I don't think that mate can be avoided that much longer because if something like b8=Q, ...Rxb8, and white plays Bxb8, he can bring another pawn up there.  And, even if black is to avoid mate by opening up a window, in addition to the R falling, ION would be up an entire Q.  So, the position is completely hopeless for black.} 32. Bc6 {}
