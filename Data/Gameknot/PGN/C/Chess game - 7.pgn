[Opening "Two knights defence (Modern bishop's opening) (C55)"]

1. e4 {I was rather happy to see this move since I like better to play against e4.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {I was more hoping for Ruy Lopes and perhaps play the Marshall gambit or even the Open variation that I have played on few occassions but the problem was that I did not have any opening repertoire as black against e4 or any other first move by white.} Nf6 {I know nothing about 3.Bc4 and the Italian game so therefore I played this move and was hoping that black would not play Ng5 or d4 and thankfully white choose a quiet continuation.} 4. d3 Be7 5. Bb3 {I must admit that I donÂ´t quite understand this move and looks like time wasting move to me, but I guess white wants to bring his bishop to c2.} d6 6. c3 Bg4 7. Nbd2 O-O 8. Nf1 {Here I was expecting castling and this move came as a complete surprise to me, but not a bad move in my mind.} Re8 9. h3 Be6 {Dubious move and I must admit that I completely missed white next move otherwhise I would probably have taken the knight.} 10. Ng5 {Here I thought for long time. I saw that I will lose a pawn, f.e. Qd7 11.Bxe6 fxe6 12.Qb3 or Bxb3 11.Qxb3. But I thought that I will get my changes for the pawn and it is a question whether white can afford the time to grab the pawn as he is already behind in development. } Bxb3 11. Qxb3 d5 12. Qxb7 {As I said earlier it is dubious whether white should take this pawn.} Qd7 {After this move I am much further in development, all my pieces are out, I have castled and the rooks are connected. Furthermore my rook stands well on the e-file aiming at the king and the queen stands well on the soon to open up d-file. White on the other hand have not yet castled, his pieces are not out and his queen is in bad position and will need few moves to get back to safety.} 13. exd5 {Not sure this is a good move but it is difficult to suggest a good move for white. This position is much easier to play for black.} Nxd5 14. Qb3 Bxg5 15. Bxg5 Nf4 {Threatening the d-pawn and it can hardly be saved. If 16.Bxf4 then exf4 opens up the e-file and looks like a sure win for black.} 16. O-O-O Nxd3+ 17. Kc2 {Kb1 was probably better. Now the queen is in danger of getting trapped.} e4 {Securing the knight on its excellent square.} 18. Ne3 {Mistake, but it is already lost for white anyway. Now I can finish the game in couple of moves.} Rab8 19. Qa3 {Only square for the queen, otherwise it would have been 19...Rxb7#.} Re5 {Threatens the bishop and winning the queen with Ra5.} 20. Nc4 Rxg5 21. g4 Qe6 {Threatens the knight and also forking the rooks among all kinds of other threats so white resigned. Actually after the pawn sacrifice on b7 it was a very easy game to play and you could say that the game played itself out. }
