1. e4 {Choice of opening...e4..anticipating dragon, sicilian, as opponent names dutch-dragon. 1..c5..as expected opponent started with sicilian } c5 2. Nf3 {supporting d4 square.} d6 {preventing e5, } 3. d4 {for open sicilian..occupying the centre} cxd4 {as expected..} 4. Nxd4 {Taking back the pawn with a piece at centre. } Nf6 {attacking at e4, and controlling important square d5.} 5. Nc3 {Supporting e4 and controllling d5 square } e5 {e5..unexpected move for me. I was expecting g6--dragon. But opponenet have something else in his mind. I feel e6 might be better, as that e pawn controll imp square d5. Anyway, his e pawn questioning my centrally placed knight.    } 6. Bb5+ {developing a piece with a tempo. Kingside is ready for castle.  Black have to defend the check. } Nbd7 {NC6..lead to disaster.. N*C6, b*c6 , B*c6..forking king and rook at a8. So Bd7 or Nbd7 is correct.Bd7 will exchange light squared bishops with Queen at d7..and then knight can develop to natural square c6.  But Nbd7 obstructing bishop at c8. } 7. Nf5 {Knight can go to f3, b3, and f5. Nf5 seems better, as it controls g7 square . so dark squared bishop cant move out from f8. g6 to question the knight will be wasting black's move. And from  f5, knight keeping an eye on the important d5 square. So i chose f5 than b3.} a6 {black should question the bishop at b5  AND relase the pressure and take control of b5. Otherwise white is threatening N*d6. } 8. Bxd7+ {Going back as Ba4 or Bc4 will give blak chance  to play b5  follwed by b4..will threatening knight at c3, supporting e4 pawn. Be2..will give oppoertunity for black to  move Nc4 attacking at e4 pawn and supporting d6 pawn by his Queen. So exchang seems appropriate. } Qxd7 {B* d7 will lose the pawn at d6. } 9. f3 {supporting the e4 pawn with a pawn, as black is threatening to N*e4, and if white answers by N * e4, black will capture the kight at f5 by queen. So f3 seems better. } d5 {opening the centre, making way for f8 bishop, as well attacking e4. } 10. Bg5 {Lets attack the knight at f6...which controlling the e4 square. } dxe4 {simplified the centre by opening the d file open for queen exchanges. } 11. Qxd7+ {making way for 0-0-0} Bxd7 {if N*d7, will lead to  N*e4 followed by 0-0-0 ..better for white. So B*d7 is better, } 12. Bxf6 {doubling the blacks pawn .and take out the support of black's e4 pawn. } gxf6 {forced} 13. fxe4 {forced , as N * e4 will lose the knight at f5.although e pawn will be an isolated pawn. } Bxf5 {otherwise, knight got a strong post at f5..} 14. exf5 {its ok..as isolated  e pawn moved to f file connecting to g pawn. } Bb4 {as game moving towards end game, good move to destroy white's pawn structure. And whiote cant avoid it} 15. O-O-O {Even though,. b file is getting open after next B*c3, putting Rook on d file immediately..seems better then 0-0.} Bxc3 {distroying white's pawn structure.} 16. bxc3 {no ther way.} Rg8 {occupying the open g file. } 17. Rd2 {other options were g3,  Rhg1,..But Rd2 ..seems better, as next plan to take Rhe1 & doubling the roook.....make strong. } Rd8 {Blocking the open d file with equal strenth... and if white exchanges immediately, black king get a move to move towards queen side. } 18. Rhd1 {doubling the rook and if black exchanges, white rook will get the open d file. } Rxd2 {If K e7, then after  both rook exchanged, black king will go back to d8, and white king will get the move to enter the field earlier. } 19. Rxd2 {forced} h5 {preventing white's g4 to support f5 pawn. } 20. h3 {prefventing Rg4 AND if rook leaves the g file, white can play g4} h4 {Rg4 might have stronger...attacking f5 pawn, ( g4 cant support it )..white need Rf2, leaving open d file. } 21. Kb2 {Time to use KIng as a piece in endgame. } Rg5 {attacking the hanging f5 pawn. } 22. Rf2 {the only support.} Ke7 {black king too enter the battlefield. } 23. Kb3 {moving towrds the centre,,should reach before black king step in,} Kd6 {fight for central position } 24. Kc4 {close to the centre} b5+ {forced to move back  so black king can occupy d5} 25. Kb4 {can go to a5 } Kd5 {prevening white  king's entry to centre. If white king moves to a5, to grab pawns at a6 and b5...black king can take c3 and a2 pawns.  Here black offers a draw,,,i accepted as the position seems unclear even after grabbing a and b pawns.   }
