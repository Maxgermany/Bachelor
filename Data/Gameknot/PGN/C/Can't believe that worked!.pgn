1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. f4 {I started this game off with my normal plan: use the Grand Prix to gain an extrodinary attack. However, I noticed the high rating of my oppenent and was somewhat worried.  In this game, you will see a successful attack pulled off by originally reckless moves. I try extremely hard to end a game I thought I couldn't win.} Nc6 4. Nf3 e6 5. d4 cxd4 6. Nxd4 {So it isn't exactly going the way I want it to. He hasn't tried to fiancheto his Bishop, and hasn't given me chances at the elegant attack I want.} Be7 7. Be3 a6 {This move lets me see something...} 8. Qf3 {This move lets me threaten g4 and 0-0-0 at the same time.} Qc7 9. Nxc6 {I decide to take out one of his defenders before castling.} bxc6 10. O-O-O Nf6 11. g4 O-O {He castles straight into an attack.} 12. g5 Nd7 13. h4 {So, you see what I mean by reckless moves.  Black should be able to punish my action on the kingside with an attack on my under-guarded queenside.} Rb8 14. h5 c5 {An error for him. This lets me get right in his grill, so to speak.} 15. h6 Qb7 {!!!BLUNDER!!! The only reason my attack will succeed is this move. He ONLY move was g6 to keep himself from my fullscale invasion.} 16. hxg7 Qxb2+ 17. Kd2 Kxg7 18. Rxh7+ {A splendid Rook sacrifice, if I do say so myself.} Kxh7 19. Qh3+ Kg8 20. Bc4 Rd8 21. Rh1 {Mate is now only a matter of 6 moves, if he opts to sacrifice all of his pieces.} Kf8 22. Qh8# {He decides not to go with all the sacrifices, and falls maintaining his dignity; he did not resign.}
