1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O {Of course, the most common response to the Ruy Lopez.} Nxe4 {Ok move.  Generally, speaking this doesn't win a pawn because white generally takes back with 5.Nxe4  But, not this time.  The question is why, meaning, why didn't he recapture?} 5. d4 {The move is ok and develops something  But, in answer to the question above: first, wrecking_ball gives things away.  The reason being is that he'll give the opponent an opportunity and make one think that winning something is enough to have a noticeable.  But, as we know, winning something is generally not enough.  You also need the theory and the fundamentals, like K safety and other things.  But, the idea is that even if you have won something, you need to still play accurately to maintain your advantages, as otherwise, you throw it away and suddenly find that the opponent has the advantage.  Often, strong enough to win, and that is exactly what wrecking_ball emphasizes and teaches by giving things away.  In fact, that's one logic behind those Q sacs as we know about.  And, often he does win because the opponent underestimates him after having won something like the Q.  The idea is, like I said, even in a winning position, you still have to be careful and not become overly confident as it could spell disaster.  Second, white will get that pawn back shortly, so it doesn't actually lose anything.  But, the idea behind the first reason is to give you something to think about, in answer to why WB does so as it's an important concept to the theory and concepts, as discussed in that club.  } Nd6 {! Ok, time to really get into it, as that's how you learn.  So, with it, one might think or ask, why Janet didn't 5...exd4 because it achieves liquidation, exchanges when ahead with 6.Nxd4, Nxd4 7.Qxd4.  Well, that isn't so, and 5...exd4?? is a blunder because white would immediately answer with 6.Qe2! actually winning a piece by directly pinning the N.  So, ...PXP isn't good.  Instead, this is the best move because black avoids that nasty pin.  And, it wins back the pawn right away.} 6. Bxc6 {So, it starts with this move. } dxc6 {Now, you might think that these doubled pawns aren't good.  First, it's toward the center, so it can't be that bad.  Second, as I learned black still has plenty of opportunities to deploy and mobilize her pieces.  In fact, it will make it that much easier, since her LSB can get right out.  So overall, being forced to double those pawns, really wasn't bad, at all.} 7. dxe5 {!! And, this is where white regains his pawn, and at the same time, gains time with this move.  Now, that brigadecommander needs to protect her piece, this gives TA the time he needs to come up with another plan.  In addition, there's even more to this then meets the eye because this is part of the plan, as I will explain more on my next comment.  But, that is why I deem it worthy of the double exclamation points.  } Nf5 8. Qxd8+ {And, this was the plan, with 7.dxe5  Instead of developing, which I would've considered, what he played, believe it or not, is exactly what I would've done.  As now, black has lost the opportunity to castle, and this kind of capture is known, from my experience to expose the K.  Of course, not right away, but eventually, as there is now a weakness which is quite vulnerable to attack.  And, that was the idea behind 7.dxe5!!} Kxd8 {As we know, this was how he had to recapture, so the move was forced.  That's why black can no longer castle.  Even though it's early to call, I'd say that with best play, white should win this game, especially, given his rating.  Taking away castling rights, like this, is how I've won several games, coincidentally.} 9. Rd1+ {Also what I would've played.} Ke8 {! Best, as any thing else loses a piece due to the e pawn.  But, white kept that in mind which is a reason that he played 9.Rd1+!} 10. Nc3 {To develop another piece.  } Be6 {The same could be said for black.} 11. Ng5 {So, if black's not threatening anything, like a mate or loss of material, why did white disobey the guideline and move the same piece more then once?  Well, the reason is that, and it's something else he teaches is that while opening guidelines are generally important, you don't have to follow them to win or do well.  There was a game where I broke all the guidelines and won, though it should've been lost with best play because of how badly my K was exposed plus being down material.  But, the idea is that, just as important as the opening guidelines, general opening principles, is theory.  And, if you don't understand about theory, even with better opening, or even being way ahead in that department, and actually having rooks connected and the center completely controlled, whereas, the other still has two or three pieces to develop, you can't defeat him.  And, he has proven it to be true.  In fact, that's where I got the idea after a lucky win to annotate a game where I didn't follow the basic guidelines, yet won, after so many told me that I lost previous game and did not do well because of my failure to open properly.  In it, he specifically commented on what people say that because you didn't follow the guidelines, you lost, and he said that's weak because of theory, fundamentals, and concepts which also play an essential role.} Bc8 {?? According to the post game analysis and WB this is the only inaccurate move from black.  Unfortunately, this loses, however.  It's a blunder, now the analysis shows why, but what WB is even worse then why it's listed as an inaccuracy.  I don't what the best move was, but what the analysis would actually be an illegal because they suggested 11...Be7  But, the reason they classify as a blunder is because of 12.Ne2, Be7 13.Nf3, Be6 14.Nf4, Bc4 15.g4, Nh4 16.Nxh4, Bxh4 17.Rd4, Bb5 18.Nh5, g5 19.f4, gxf4 20.Bxf4  But, as noted, WB has bigger plans.  And, one thing worth noting, is that after this move, white calculates this win.  I know because it was indirectly implied in the Deeper Chess Theory Club.  And, the thing is that, despite not being a GM, as per what he said, he can occasionally calculate 60 moves in advance which is very impressive.  So, that's where it generally only takes one mistake to make or break against a player like TA.  } 12. Nge4 {Already starting the aggressive plan, as noted earlier.} Be6 {Ok, getting a piece into play, and preparing to castle which is always a good idea.} 13. h3 {In general, this would not be a good move since he developed that h pawn before getting the last piece out and opening up a pawn right near the K.  But, this is an exception as it's part of his winning plan.  And, one thing to add is that I've seen TA win with his K exposed.  He showed a game a game where it was beyond exposed but still won.} h5 {! The idea behind this is to prevent white from taking that B, and forcing her to double pawns.   However, better was to castle with 13...0-0-0 since K safety is very important. } 14. Ng5 {So, white comes back with that aggressive move.  } Rh6 {But, black won't have to double up when if white plays 15.Nxe6, and that is why 13...h5! was good.  However, this is where I, as noted, would've castled Q side, once and for all for the reasons outlined earlier.} 15. Ne2 {I don't why he played this.  Instead, I would've played 15.Nge4 and when black gets the R out of harm's way, I'd bring out the last piece, as white.  In fact, completetion of development is the only grounds that I would even do the discover attack.} Bd5 {To avoid exchanging N for B, since in general, a bishop is worth more.} 16. Nf4 {Supports what I said a move ago as white is still going or that exchange.} Rd8 {! But, before black does not allow it.  And, it is the best way to avoid the exchange as any other means of protection would lose a piece, due to the e pawn. } 17. e6 {! Like I said earlier, as it does lose a pawn, TA will often give things away, but there's a strategy and a lesson to behind it.  You still have to be careful and play accurately, even after you have won something.} fxe6 {So, without further a due, black takes.} 18. c4 {So, white plays here.  Now, in general, it wins a piece since the LSB is jammed, but not this time.} Be7 {Instead, black responds here so that when white takes the B, black takes back and it's an exchange.  However, we are now starting notice white's advantages increase since that B is going to be exchanged for the N, as noted earlier.} 19. cxd5 {As I mentioned.} Bxg5 {Like I also said, white's advantages are becoming more noticeable.} 20. Re1 {One idea is to attack the center with the R as attacking is also a way to contest the center.  The other plan is so that white can win back a pawn.} Bxf4 {But, as we expect, black does not make it easy because she takes.} 21. Bxf4 {So does white.} Rg6 {This time, to prevent white from taking on e6, but Joe has other plans, as we know.} 22. dxc6 {So, he takes, and the idea is to take advantage of those doubled pawns, since he did this on c6.} bxc6 {So, she takes.  But, worth noting is that this was the only place to recapture, so Janet remains with doubled pawns which was one of white's plans.} 23. Re4 {The idea is to double up on the e file, which is why white played.  So, the only question that remains is how long will it take before that happens.} Rd5 {I don't know why black this.  Her N was not in danger because even if 24.Re5, black can still play this and protect the N.  But, with this move, white wins back a pawn, for now.  Instead, I would've played 23...Rd7 to protect the d pawn.} 24. Bxc7 Kd7 {! Normally, not good when you don't want to move that K before the endgame, as where it's generally exposed.  But, this is an exception and a very good move, mobilizing that K and preparing it for action.  So, there is a plan behind this.} 25. Bb8 {Keeping his B safe.} a5 {Also possible was 25...a6, but I like this move better as the pawn advances further and it becomes a passed pawn, which, by definition can be stopped.  So, it's really a matter of time before that happens.} 26. Rc1 {To put pressure on the c6 pawn.} Nd4 {To alleviate the pressure, as you now have an added defender for the c file.} 27. Kh2 {To activate and mobilize his K.  While we're not quite at that phase, yet, it's getting close to an endgame.} c5 {Now, the idea is to take the pressure off of the c file, at once.} 28. Be5 {Unlike before, I have no idea why white played this.} Nb5 {In my opinion, this move was not necessary, as the N was already protected.  But, my guess is that black had other plans.  And, she did so to prevent white from trying since the plan was Bd4, at some point, and this move stops him from doing that.} 29. b3 {A very good idea.  Normally, I wouldn't have a clue as to why this was played.  But, it makes sense because, in this position, Joe is achieving a solid pawn structure by connecting his a and b pawns.  And, I learned all about this from TA/WB, himself in the Deeper Chess Theory club as posted a very instructive video by a GM.  It gave you the idea of those solid pawn structures.} Nd6 {! Understandable as white was threatening 30.a4 which keeps those structures against the N.  And, this move puts pressure right on the center.  } 30. Ree1 {! Protecting it.  And, now, things are getting more and more interesting.} Kc6 {I do not know why black played this.} 31. Kg1 {But, I do know what's happening for white.  As it turns out, it is a WM, waiting move, to see what black will do next, and then he'll go from there.} Rd2 {Black's idea is to win that a pawn.} 32. a3 {But, white does not allow it.  As noted, 32.a4 was also playable, and this is how I would've moved to maintain that pawn chain.  But, the problem, though is that the b pawn is then blocked and can no longer move.  My guess is that TA is doing another WM, and just waiting for the right opportunity to move that pawn again and make it quite dangerous.} Kb6 {I have no idea why she moved here, but my guess was to prevent white from getting passed pawns on the a and b files.} 33. Kf1 {But, white is doing another WM, in my opinion.  Worth noting that Joe does a lot of WM because the idea is that he's waiting for opportunities to arrive when the opponent has a weakness.  However, waits until he figures out, exactly what it is, so that he can exploit it.} Rd5 {However, I don't know what black is trying to accomplish here.  It could be a WM there, but why move that R and then back again, shortly after?  That is the question.} 34. Bb2 {At first, I didn't know why he played this.  In this position, where black to take that B, white certainly would've won the R, in exchange.  But, forget about systems or anything else like that.  In this particular position, his B is worth more then the R's, as right now, it has potential to do damage, so he's not going to exchange his B, even for her R.} Rd2 {That is proven here, where Janet decides to put pressure right on the B.} 35. Bc3 {Of course, Joe protects it with a counterattack.} Rd3 {But, so does black with this move.} 36. a4 {To achieve that pawn chain.  But, I would've played 36.Be5 because of what I mentioned earlier.} h4 {My guess is that this is a WM as black intends to get a pawn chain.  First, by moving the g R, and then advancing that g pawn, until it reaches the fifth rank.} 37. Re5 {To put pressure on the fifth rank.} Nf5 {Of course, black has a way out of that, for now.} 38. Bb2 {To keep that B safe, again.  } Rxb3 {Of course, it loses a pawn, but that B needed the protection and, once again, the loss of material against WB is not that big of a deal because he has more ways to compensate, then it might appear.} 39. Ba1 {Still keeping that B protected.} Rb4 {To win another pawn.} 40. Rexc5 {But, this time, white exchanges, instead of giving up another pawn.  Plus, he is doubling up, which as we know, two R's on the same file is known to be quite dangerous.} Rxa4 {While still putting pressure on his B.} 41. Be5 {The idea still remains to protect that B.} Ne7 {I don't know why black played this.} 42. Bc7+ {! Happens to be a very serious check.  As, while it might not appear, it's going to leave black with problems.} Ka6 {I am actually surprised that black did not play 42...Ka7} 43. Rb1 {! And, that's because of what he played.} e5 {I don't know why she played this.  Instead, my next move would've been 43...Ka7, to prevent white from playing 44.Rb6+, which that move would be forced, anyway, but she would be in check automatically gaining tempo for white.} 44. Rxe5 {As noted, I would've considered placing black in check with 44.Rb6+  However, I, most likely, would've played this as the move is better.  Getting a pawn back, and putting pressure right on that e N, in return.  The check could always wait, until later.} Nc6 {! The best.  Also possible was 44...Nc8 or 44...Ng8, but this puts pressure right on the e R.} 45. Reb5 {Planning a nasty check.  And, Joe can do this two ways.  The first idea is to check with 46.Rb6+} Nb4 {But, Janet does not allow this, as she intercedes with her N.} 46. Rb8 {So, this is his second plan.  It's now strategy, as opposed to tactic because he's preparing for his next move.} Rc6 {Still trying to get that B.} 47. Ra8+ {But, this is the check I was also alluding to, which was also the idea behind 45.Reb5} Kb5 {47...Kb7 was also an option.  In fact, this is what I would've played, if I were black.} 48. Bd8 {Still doing what it takes to protect the B.} Rc4 {I don't know why she played this.} 49. Ra7 {But, white's intention's are very good.  It isn't just the pawn, but what he's doing is putting pressure on the seventh rank.  One thing worth noting, as I learned in an annotation, that a R on the seventh is quite powerful and dangerous.  I learned that in my game against chesskingdom64} g6 {To protect.  Although I really like 49...g5 for the pawn chain, as noted earlier, this time, connected pawns would be a mistake.  That's because playing would automatically lose a pawn after 50.Bxg5} 50. Rg7 {! But, with this move, is going to win a pawn, one or another.  That is, either the g pawn or the h pawn.  As they say, one will fall. } Rc6 {And, it is going to be the h pawn.} 51. Bxh4 Kc4 {Going for the opposition.} 52. Rc1+ {But, it is too little, too late, for that.} Nc2 {?? Blunder.  As I recently learned from Jack, when the opponent places you in check, it's usually not a good idea to get out of it by interceding with a piece.  Meaning, moving a piece, as opposed to, the K.  Instead, it's better to use the K.  And, this move allows white to win a N and get a skewer with another, which wins a R.  But, what he's about to play is worse then that.  } 53. Bg5 {Therefore, I would've played 53.Rxc2, if I were white.  But, I understand why he played this, instead.  And, with things are actually worse for black, then it appears.} Ra2 {Protecting the N, for now.  But, it is going to fall rather soon, as we're about to see.} 54. g4 {Getting his own pawn chain.} Kb3 {Using her K as a weapon since it is guarding that N and R which makes it impossible to take for now.} 55. Rb1+ {At first, I was trying to figure out why black resigned here, so I did HW on it.  The reason why is that, while it would take a while, even with best play from Janet, white has a mating patter against black.  It's not definitely how white would mate, but this is an alternative solution meaning one way to do this.  So, something like 55...Ka4  56.Ke2, Rc5 57.Bd2, Ka3 58.Ra4, Nd4+ 59.Kd3, Nf3 60.Bxa5, Ka4 61.Bd8+, Ra5 62.Rxa5#  Even if that's not how, white has ways to mate, with no way out of it for black.  As a result, Janet resigned.  Overall, I really enjoyed studying this game from wrecking_ball.  But, the moral is that you have to be very careful, especially against a stronger player.  Even if you play super well, against someone like WB, it only takes one mistake to go wrong which is often the case.  Something like this also happened in a game between Tom and a master.  And, Tom was a piece ahead and had a won game.  But, he made one mistake, and that was enough for that master to get his advantages back and win the game, interestingly enough.}
