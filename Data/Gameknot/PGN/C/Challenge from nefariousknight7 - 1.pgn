[Opening "Benoni (A66), pawn storm variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 {Opening with d4, I wanted to start the game with either QG or Queen's pawn game, but it quickly developed into the Benoni defense.} e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Bg5 Bg7 8. f3 {My decision to play f3 didn't come without a price.  I could have played Nf3, but that ultimately leaves my pawn structure unsound, unless I maneuver Ng1 to d2; and that could leave my kingside vulnerable.  My goal with f3 is to disallow ... Ng4 or Bg4, and to allow my Knight to post on a strong g4 square.} O-O 9. Qd2 {This will keep black from moving h6, forcing my bishop to either attack or retreat. This also helps to reduce the temptation of black from moving Qb6, then ... c4, exposing my kingside and a weak b2 pawn, (not to mention my kingside is quite undeveloped at this point.)  This position allows for a huge attach on black, but I need to be careful about how I move.} a6 10. a4 Nbd7 11. Nh3 {Here, I begin developing my kingside, with an ultimate goal of posting my knight on g4.} Rb8 12. Nf4 {Here, I make a mistake.  I get over ambitious and cause what I had been trying to avoid.} h6 {Here it is . . . h6.  This forces my bishop to attack, (as a retreat to h4 would cause g5, forking my bishop and knight.)  I am beginning to see how bad of a move Nf4 was.} 13. Bxf6 Nxf6 14. Be2 g5 {Black pushes his pawn to g5 like anticipated and proper.  So far, black is very well developed, and has the upper hand on position, (my only saving grace is my pawn structure here.)} 15. Nd3 {Since I have ruined my kingside, and black has easily and deftly created an opportunity for an attack, I decide to move my knight to d3 with a goal again of posting it on g5 or e4.} b5 16. axb5 {Black is now using his momentum to deftly take advantage of my increasingly difficult situation.  The only good to come out of this will be my rook seizing the a file.  I may be able to eventually seize black's d6 pawn from the queenside and collapse his pawn structure.} axb5 17. b4 c4 {However, after 16. axb5 axb5 17. b4 c4, I must move my knight to f2, lest black post his queen on b6, and I will not be able to castle . . . at least for a while.} 18. Nf2 Bd7 19. O-O Nh5 20. g3 {However, I move Nf2 and castle, and he begins an attack on my kingside while guarding his b5 pawn.  It isn't looking good for white.  g3 keeps black from posting on f4, but may allow an attack on h3 from black's bishop.  Given white's situation, at the time I thought this was the best move I could have made.  Black's move to h5 also pins my knight on c3, guarded only by my queen.  It will take a couple moves I do not have to unpin it.} f5 {Here, black successfully attacks my pawn structure.  His rook is now a threat.} 21. f4 {Instead of capturing f5, I move my pawn to f4, forcing black to retreat, or support it with either Be8, (which will remove 1 support on b5), or Qe8, taking him longer or even impossible to post his queen on b6.  My bishop is now attacking black's knight, and creates a little forward momentum for white.  } Be8 22. exf5 {This isolates my d pawn, but now black cannot move his pawn to g4, for it will be attacked by my bishop on e3.  This also creates an avenue for my knight to become more active on e4, (as long as Qb6 is not a problem.)  I could have chosen to move fxg5, but this would allow black to develop better with hxg5, then . . . g4.} gxf4 {Instead of retaking my pawn black makes an excellent move gxf4!.  Now I must take his knight.} 23. Bxh5 Bxh5 24. Nfe4 {I'm rushing again.  In an attempt to unpin my knight, free my queen to move, and allow my knight to move more freely, I move Ne4 too soon.} f3 25. h3 Qb6+ 26. Nf2 {Now I must move my knight back, but I plan on threatening black's bishop with g4.  I have given up on my dead f5 pawn.  Now both of white's knights are pinned.} Rxf5 27. g4 Rg5 {I forked black's bishop and rook with g4, but cannot follow through as gxh5 would put me in check.} 28. Nce4 {Considering the situation, I am willing to trade rooks.} Rg6 29. Rae1 {Black declines the trade, and I bring my a1 rook into the game.} Bxg4 30. hxg4 Rxg4+ 31. Kh2 Be5+ {After 29. . . . Bxg4 30. hxg4 Rxg4+ 31. Kh2 Be5+, the situation is not looking good for white.  My kingside is completely exposed.  My best defender here is black's h6 pawn!} 32. Kh3 Rg6 33. Ng4 {Black moves his rook out of trouble.  But after Ng4, things start looking a little different.  There is still a threat of a mating attack from black's queen and rook, but my situation doesn't look quite so dire.} Qb7 {Black accepts the trade, and moves his queen into position.} 34. Nxe5 Qc8+ 35. Kh4 dxe5 36. Rfg1 {Instead of taking black's pawn, I have decided black's rook is becoming to big of a problem, as next move would have been Qg4#, and the game would have been over.  I don't have much of a choice.} Qf5 37. Rxg6+ Qxg6 {I happily trade rooks, and black's queen looks exposed to me from this angle.  With a little support from my queen, I could possibly place my rook on g1 pinning black's queen.  However, black is too cunning for that kind of amateur move.} 38. Qf2 Kh7 39. Qxf3 {Black saw the pin, but now I have won a pawn and position.} Rb7 {I must keep my queen very close to my king for the rest of the game to avoid mate.  My plan from here is to use my advantage of a knight to force black's moves and gain another pawn, and ultimately promote my d pawn to a queen.} 40. Nf6+ Kh8 41. Rxe5 Kg7 42. Nh5+ Kh7 43. Rf5 {after 43. Rf5, my knight is now in a good position to threaten and support the promotion of my d pawn to a queen.  Black is now on the defensive.  However, I must keep the momentum strong, else black support and promote his c pawn.} Re7 44. Nf6+ {It was a good idea for black to move his rook to e7.  He foresaw white's pawn on d7, and wanted to be on the correct side of the action.  However, this check is forcing black's queen into a very tight position.} Kh8 45. d6 Rf7 46. d7 Rf8 47. Nh5 {I considered Ne8, but this leaves me with a greater advantage.  If black chooses to trade pieces, I will promote my pawn and checkmate black.} Rg8 48. Rf8 {One of black's only mistakes in the game.  I have pinned black's rook, and now it is not looking good for black.} Qg5+ 49. Kh3 Qe7 {A good move, but it allows me to promote my queen.} 50. d8=Q Qe6+ 51. Kh4 Qe1+ 52. Ng3 {After 50. d8=Q Qe6+ 51 Kh4 Qe1+ 52. Ng3, black resigns.  A battle fought long and hard, this victory had not come easily.}
