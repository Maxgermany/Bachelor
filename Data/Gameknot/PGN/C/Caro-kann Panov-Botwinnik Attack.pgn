[Opening "Caro-Kann (B14), Panov-Botvinnik attack, 5...e6"]

1. e4 {I chose to anotate this game for instructive purposes. } c6 {Much like the French defence, the Caro-kann defence is aimed at  playing the move d7-d5. This will force white to make a decision sooner or later, wether to move his e-pawn forward, defend it or exchange. } 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 {This is the exchange variation of the Caro-kann.  As pointed out at the previous note, white could've also played 3.Nc3 or 3.e5.  But unlike other exchange variations ( like in the French Defence ), the Caro-kann exchange variation doesn't lead to a rather lifeless simplified position. Instead, the more modern approach to this exchange variation can lead to more complicated play then other variations of the Caro-kann. } cxd5 4. c4 {! The Panov-Botwinnik attack. 4.Bd3 or 4.Nf3 does lead to simpel play with more drawing chances, and so the textmove is an energetic attempt to keep the advantage. This position can also be reached in other openings.  With the textmove white risks an isolated pawn ( 4...dxc4 ), but white then gets obvious space advantage and lead in development as compensation.} Nf6 {The strongest continuation.  Another possibility 4. ... Nc6 5.cxd5 Qxd5 6.Nf3 leads to a position wich can also be reached with the Sicilian defence: 1.e4 c5 2.c3 d5 3.exd5 Qxd5 4.d4 Nc6 5.Nf3 cxd4 6.cxd4. White is slightly better, as shown by 6. ... Bg4 7.Nc3! Bxf3 8.gxf3 Qxd4 9.Qxd4 Nxd4 10.Nb5! ( I suggest you check out the Game DB for this position! )} 5. Nc3 e6 {A solid move, but still white has slight advantage.} 6. Nf3 Bb4 {Both players developing their pieces. } 7. Qb3 {? Best is to play 7.cxd5 here. The continuation 7... Nxd5 8.Bd2 Nc6 9.Bd3 O-O 10.O-O is favourable for white. Instead Ninjabrown decides to charge out early in the game with his queen.} Qb6 {? 7. ... Nc6 would have been a natural move now, developing the knight and defending the bishop on b4. The Game DB actually gives the move 8.Bg5 with equal play. } 8. c5 {The result of black's last move, the black queen is an easy target for harassment.} Bxc3+ {Probably the safest continuation.} 9. bxc3 Qc7 {Black keeps the queens on the board, hoping for more counterplay.} 10. g3 {! Allowing 11.Bf4 and the fianchetto on g2. } Nc6 11. Bf4 Qe7 12. Bd6 {The poor black queen isn't left alone. } Qd7 13. c4 {Again white plays the move c4!} Ne4 {Black want's to remove the bishop on d6, wich is preventing him from castling, but the textmove weakens the d5 square.} 14. cxd5 {!} Nxd6 {? A blunder wich costs black a piece.} 15. dxc6 {The knight on d6 is now lost.} bxc6 16. cxd6 Qxd6 17. Bg2 Rb8 18. Qc3 Ba6 {Black wants to prevent white from castling and tries to set up a trap.} 19. Ne5 O-O {?} 20. Qc5 {If white played 20.Qxc6? then 20. ...Qxd4 would have at least won back the piece for black since the rook and knight are both being attacked. Note that 21.Qxa6 Qxa1  ( with the knight also attacked, not to mention the exposed king ) looks very good for black.  But....20.Nxc6 Rc8 21.Rc1 wins for white. I guess ninjabrown probably smelled a rat and decided not to take the pawn and offer a queentrade instead wich leads to a winning endgame for white. } Qxc5 21. dxc5 Rb5 22. Bf1 {Here black resigned because of 22. ... Rxc5 23.Nd7 or 22...Ra5 23.Nxc6 Rxc5 24.Ne7  followed by 25.Bxh6. A nice example how to gradually increase the advantage and finally winning the game, through solid play and by exploiting your opponent's weaknesses. }
