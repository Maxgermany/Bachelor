1. e4 {This was a draw with a very promising 17 year old junior. I was reasonably pleased with my play,although he did miss a great chance, as we shall see} c5 {So I play the Sicilian Defence} 2. Nf3 {He plays main line} Nc6 {So do I} 3. Bb5 {Slightly unusual} e6 {Afterwards a team colleagues commented that g6 was a better move. It is more popular, but it is debatable whether it is really better than e6. Nd4 is another option. } 4. Bxc6 {So he takes} bxc6 {I take back} 5. e5 {I am not sure that this is best, 0-0 or d3 are options. He is trying to exploit my weakness} Ba6 {I tried to stop him castling} 6. d3 {He prepares castling} c4 {I plan to exchange my doubled pawn.} 7. O-O {He falls in with my plan,rather than playing d4!} cxd3 {I take} 8. cxd3 {He takes back} Ne7 {It is going to d5} 9. Re1 {To release his d pawn} Nd5 {Continuing with my plan} 10. d4 {I think this is weak as his bishop is in danger of becoming weak} Be7 {I continue to develop} 11. Nc3 {He develops} Nxc3 {I take} 12. bxc3 {He takes back} Rb8 {0-0 is better} 13. Qc2 {Preparing c4} d5 {Played to stop d5} 14. exd6 e.p. {He takes} Bxd6 {I take back} 15. Ng5 h6 {This is playing with fire! he should have played 16.	Nxe6	fxe6 17.	Rxe6+ for instance	Kd7 18.	Qf5	Rf8 19.	Rxd6+	Kxd6 20.	Bf4+	Ke7 21.	Re1+	 CHECK wins for white. If 17.....Be7 then Ba3 and Re1 win for white. If 17......Kf7 then 18. Qg6+ and white wins the bishop on d6 with a huge advantage. Black may be able to grovel on with a piece for 3 pawns, in some variations, after 17... Kf8, but his Rh8 will be out of the game in those lines.} 16. Ne4 {Missing his chance!} O-O {best!} 17. Nxd6 {He takes} Qxd6 {I take back} 18. a4 {Threatening Ba3} Rfc8 {Avoiding the trap,but probably too passive} 19. Ba3 {Attacking my queen} Qd5 {Trying to keep control of the white squares} 20. Rab1 {Contesting the b file} Bc4 {Trying to cement control of the white squares} 21. Re5 {Hitting the queen} Bb3 {I counter-attack his queen} 22. Qd3 Qc4 {Saving my queen} 23. Qxc4 {He takes} Bxc4 {I take back} 24. Rxb8 {He takes} Rxb8 {I take, threatening Rb1 mating} 25. Bb4 {Protecting the back rank} Bd5 {Now I am threatening a5} 26. h3 {Giving his king a flight square} a5 {I play it anyway} 27. Bxa5 {He takes} Ra8 {I hit his bishop} 28. Bb4 {He goes back} Rxa4 {I take} 29. Re2 {Draw agreed, on his suggestion. Many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two, letting me know how I am doing.
