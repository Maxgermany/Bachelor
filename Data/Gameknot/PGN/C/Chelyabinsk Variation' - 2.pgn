1. e4 {Another taken from the Chelyabinsk Variation tournament} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {Starting position} 6. Ndb5 {This opens up some interesting possibilities, the b knight has an eye on d6 and c7 the c knight is looking at d5, note also the white queen has a half open file.} d6 {Almost forced, black now has the d6 square defended by his queen and his dsb} 7. Nd5 {Applies some considerable pressure to c7} Nxd5 8. exd5 {The knight choices are limited now, if he moves to b4 for example I can chase it around a little while developing some of my pieces, so gaining some tempo} Ne7 {Probably the best option however blacks dsb now cannot develop without moving another piece first} 9. c3 {Opens the line to a4 for my queen, note that there is a nice line to the king - a4-e8, I did consider c4 but felt that restricted my lsb too much} a6 10. Qa4 {threatens mate with Nxd6. Black is under some severe pressure now and will surely have to lose material to save the game} axb5 {Possibly the only option that allows black to survive} 11. Bxb5+ Bd7 12. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {forced, I can now gain the rook} 13. Qxa8+ {Up to this point we were still in the Gameknot database!} Nc8 {Unsurprisingly black declines to exchange queens} 14. O-O Be7 15. Qa5 b6 {Trying to pressure my queen but I think this is a mistake as it allows my queen to get into a slightly better position. Should black have castled instead?} 16. Qa6 O-O 17. Be3 Bd8 {My development is finally complete and I am ready to throw my pawns forward on the queens side} 18. b4 Qf5 {This move is a bit of a mystery to me ...} 19. a4 {So I continue with my plan ...} e4 {However the purpose of it now becomes clearer.  I think this is a mistake as he now has 3 weak pawns and I can easily cover mine} 20. Qc4 Ne7 {Still going for my d pawn} 21. Rfd1 {I used this rook as the other was supporting the pawn push and my f pawn is protected by my dsb} h5 {Trying to counter} 22. a5 bxa5 23. bxa5 {I decided to take with my pawn as a8 is white and black has no lsb, it is also more tricky to get his knight into a useful position on that side, which meant that I thought this pawn had some good chances to cause problems} Ng6 {Continuing the counter effort} 24. a6 {For now I ignore it} Ne5 {I wasn't sure what the big benefit of this move was at the time, though we will see later} 25. Qb5 Bc7 {Allows his rook to protect the a8 square} 26. a7 {Continuing the push. The pawn here is well defended} Nf3+ {This move scared me, if I take with the pawn I am in big trouble, 27 gxf3, exf3 means that my king is potentially trapped on the back row by his pawn.} 27. Kh1 {f1 would have lost my h pawn, there is little he can do now though to threaten my king even though it is cornered} Qe5 {Threatening mate with Qxh2} 28. gxf3 {Black threw in the towel.  Thanks for reading}
