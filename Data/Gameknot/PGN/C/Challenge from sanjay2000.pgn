1. e4 {The King's Pawn Opening.} g6 {In this position, his goal is to develop his DSB.  However, this is out of book, but it's still playable.} 2. Nf3 {However, I am also determined to develop. } Bg7 {Now, he gets a good fianchetto.  Although feasible, it is also unusual to get a fiachetto, this early.  In fact, I have not seen where someone fianchettos a bishop, by move 2.} 3. Bc4 {So, I am still going to develop.  Note: I was planning to play this game, as if it were a Guaco Piano, eventhough I know that it is far from it.  In fact, I realize that it will never become a Guaco Piano or Ruy Lopez, but it does not matter.  My only goal is to play those types of moves, so that I will not overwhelmed by an opening out of book.  In addition, this move pins his f7 pawn.  Afterall, that is part of my weak area.  I wonder, however, how do you become familiar with something that is out of book, or that you are not accustomed to?} Nf6 {So, he continues with development and is prepared to castle.} 4. Nc3 {In the meantime, I decide to develop my other Knight because you are supposed to get your pieces out, ASAP.} e6 {I don't know why he played this.    } 5. O-O {So, I castle, and he responds by castling, as well.} O-O 6. d3 {My goal is to develop my DSB, in this position, without wasting time.  That's why this move was played, as opposed to 6.b3.  However, best was 6.d4 as this move blocks my LSB.  This time, however, it is not as much of a problem, given that this is the only time that my LSB will move.  Therefore, I will not have to waste any time.} Nc6 {He continues to develop.} 7. Bg5 {And, I do the same thing, by pinning his f6 Knight.} h6 {Although the pin looks like a mistake, as it is supposed to lose tempo.  That's not the case, here.  Why?  Kicking my DSB is not going to benefit his position, because he does not get anything out of it.  Afterall, it does not lose material, so getting kicked around the board does not bother me.  As we will see, I retreat my DSB, while keeping his Knight pinned.  Then, he will kick it again, only to break the pin.  If I were black, I would not attack material, just to break a pin.  } 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 Nh5 {I do not know why made this move.  The only thing I see is that a Knight on the rim is grim.  However, that is only a small detail.  You can't base a position, around that.} 10. Nxg5 {?? I figured that I had won a free pawn, not seeing his h5 pawn.  Therefore, this is the losing blunder, as it gives away a piece, for a pawn.  In addition, this move will result in a King exposure, after I am done exchanging material.} Nxg3 11. fxg3 Qxg5 12. Re1 {I do not know what I was thinking, at this point.  In this position, I thought that my rook was in danger but am completely wrong.} Bd4+ {So, he does not waste any time, to place me in check.  I could get out of check in three ways, with 13.Kh1, 13.Kf1, or 13.Re3.  However, 13.Re3?? just gives away a free rook, and 13.Kh1 exposes my King even worse.  Therefore, best is 13.Kh1.} 13. Kh1 Ne5 {In this position, he is only interested in exchanging my LSB for his e5 Knight because he knows that I am behind.  However, I have other plans that are almost worthless.  What are they, and why am I planning something so obvious? } 14. Nb5 {This is it.  My only goal is to win his c7 pawn, and threaten with 15.Nxc7.  Normally, I do not make obvious threats, as was discussed in my game against youthanasia66.  However, this is quite different because I know that the game is lost, no matter what I do.  Afterall, black-cat-hamelet would say, "The only time playing badly would ever be of any use is if you are losing anyway and try a strategy you know can fail in the hope that your opponent falls for the trap."  This is one of those times.} Bxb2 {So, he takes advantage by winning my b2 pawn and essentially threatening to exchange my a1 Rook, for his LSB.  However, I sort of knew that my strategy would fail, given that this was similar to a cheapo tactic.  I also knew that the game was lost, so my only goal is to distract him, so that I can stay in the game, a little longer.  My goal is actually working.  Why?  If I hadn't tried something so obvious (had not played 14.Nb5) I would have resigned, at this point.  On the other hand, Jack Stockel has told me not to resign immediately.} 15. Rb1 {So, I decide to protect my Rook by shooing away his DSB.} Ng4 {At first, I had no idea why he played this.  However, I quickly figured out that his goal is to set up a mating sequence with his remaining Knight and Queen.} 16. Qe2 {Therefore, I have to prevent this, so I decide to bring out my Queen out, at last.  Note: this is not too early as all the other pieces have been developed.  In addition, he knows my weakspot, so I have to do whatever I can, to protect my King and Queen.  BTW, that is the only thing stopping me from taking his DSB.  Because if 16.Rxb2??, 16...Nf2+, winning my Queen, with his Knight fork.} Be5 {Therefore, he retreats.  If he cannot win more valuable material or mate (therefore, to succeed with a deflective sac), why would he be willing to give away a piece?} 17. d4 {?? So, I go for brokes (anything), by reattacking his DSB.  As it turns out, however, this move will end the game quickly, as we will see.  Either way, however, I do not mind because I already know that the game is lost.} Bxg3 {At first, At first, I viewed this as a mistake, as this gives away a piece, for a pawn.  As it turns out, however, this move seals my fate.  Why?  After I retake, he places me in check.  Then, a mate in one is inevitable.  After 18...Qh5+, this will happen, 19.Kg1 (forced), 19...Qh2#.  As a result, I resign, after 18...Qh5+.} 18. hxg3 Qh5+ {}
