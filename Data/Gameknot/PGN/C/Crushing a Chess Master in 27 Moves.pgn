1. c4 {I kicked off the game with an English Opening.} e6 {Black aims for an early d5 with this move.} 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 {The game has transposed from the English to the Queen's Gambit Declined.} Be7 {This move was played by Spassky and others.} 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bf4 {This move scores higher in databases than Bg5.} O-O 6. e3 c5 {A huge battle in the center broods.} 7. Be2 {Preparing to castle, but the Fritz engine considers this a mistake.} Nc6 8. O-O cxd4 9. Nxd4 {e5? loses to Nxc6 followed by Bxe5.} a6 10. Bf3 {Fighting for the center} Na5 {The knight was better on c6. From here, it was as if Black was playing a piece down due to the Knight on the edge of the board.} 11. cxd5 exd5 {After this pawn exchange, Black's light-square bishop is released., but it doesn't have many squares. White's centralized Knight on d4 covers the important f5 square. Black is now left with an isolated d-pawn.} 12. Rc1 {Preparing to seize the c-file} h6 {This move, along with a6, seem to be a waste of time.} 13. Qc2 Bd6 {Offering an exchange of bishops} 14. g3 {White will open the g-file if Black captures on f4.} Bh3 {Developing the bishop with tempo} 15. Rfd1 Bxf4 16. gxf4 {The g-file has been opened. Now White just needs to bring a rook to the g-file.} Rc8 17. Kh1 Re8 {Black has pressure on the c and e-files, but can he make the most of them?} 18. Rdg1 {White's rook points menacingly at the Black king.} Ne4 19. Bxe4 {White exchanges the bishop for the dangerous-looking knight on e4.} dxe4 20. Rg3 {White can now double rooks without losing time.} Qh4 21. Rcg1 g6 22. f3 {! clearing the f2-square the for Queen and also threatening to capture on e4, after which white will have a strong center, along with a dangerous attack on the g-file.} exf3 23. Rg3xg6+ {Black cannot capture fxg6 due to Qxg6+ followed by mate on g7.} Kh8 24. Nxf3 {Attacking the Queen} Qh5 25. Rg6g3 Bf5 26. Qe2 {Preparing for a discovered attack} Rc4 {Now for the finishing blow ...} 27. Ne5 {Black resigned here, because if the Queen moves, then Nxf7 followed by Rg7 Mate. Otherwise, he loses his Queen.}
