1. e4 {This turnes out a pretty good game, but I tried to many "Giving up value" things to make a good outcome. But he prevails} Nf6 2. d3 Nc6 3. c3 {I always take this kind of a position. Of course, this puts down value in queenside castling, but I never castle that way anyways} d6 4. Be2 g6 5. Bg5 Bg7 6. Qd2 {I was figuring that next move I could play BH6, BxH6, QxH6, and I would get into the action. } Bd7 7. d4 {Oops. I left a pawn hanging} Nxe4 8. Qe3 Nxg5 9. Qxg5 {On the bright side, now I have a good rank to stay on} O-O 10. Nf3 e5 11. Qxd8 {I was thinking- "First things first." My knight on G5 wouldn't do very good} Raxd8 12. O-O {Sounds reasonable I thought} exd4 13. cxd4 Nxd4 14. Nxd4 Bxd4 {A good way to catch another pawn, and put worry on my rook} 15. Nc3 a6 16. Bf3 {An extra pawn would help alot, and since my bishop wasn't the best placed anyways} c6 17. Rfe1 Rfe8 18. Kf1 {I'm not EXACTLY sure why I did that, just that it would help if we ended up trading out all our rooks about here } d5 19. Rxe8+ Rxe8 20. Rd1 Bf6 21. g3 b5 {I decided to go wild. I was 2 pawns down, so I decided in the end game, a bishop and pawn vs. a king would be better than maybe 2 pawns. And who knows. They might be on seperate sides. That is from A to H} 22. Nxd5 cxd5 23. Bxd5 Bh3+ 24. Kg1 {I would be wrong to move my rook off the 1st rank. He knows that a checkmate would follow.  } Rd8 25. Bf3 Rxd1+ 26. Bxd1 Be6 27. Bb3 Bxb3 28. axb3 Bxb2 {Right now we're even, but soon I will need to abandon my right side pawns. then it comes down to if he can stalemate} 29. Kf1 a5 30. Ke2 a4 { I might've made a wrong turn here when I didn't kill it. I just thought I couldn't make it} 31. Kd1 a3 32. Kc2 b4 33. Kb1 f5 34. Kc2 Kf7 35. Kb1 Ke6 36. Kc2 Ke5 37. Kb1 Ke4 38. Ka2 Kf3 39. Kb1 Kxf2 40. Kc2 Kg2 {He went at my pawns when all he needed to do was kill my B3 pawn with his king, then A2 would be checkmate. But he tried a different plan. It forced me to go for three fold repetition, but then, I remembered it had to be forced} 41. Kb1 Kxh2 42. Ka2 Kxg3 43. Kb1 Kf3 44. Kc2 Ke3 45. Kb1 Bc3 {? I thought} 46. Ka2 Kd3 47. Kb1 {His plan made sence now. Forced mate in 6} f4 48. Kc1 f3 49. Kb1 {Stalemate was my only hope now. But he said he would not make stalemate, and he didn't} f2 50. Ka2 g5 51. Kb1 f1=R+ 52. Ka2 Ra1# {It turned out to be quite a good game. But when I sacrificed my bishop, it gave him an advantage. I got to play it more safe with my coaches}
