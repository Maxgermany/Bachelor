1. Nc3 e5 2. d4 f6 {I wasn't sure what I was thinking at this point. I usually consult opening databases to reason about each move before I made the decision. I guess I just wasn't keen on 3. dxe5, dxe5 4. Qxd8 , Kxd8. I'll have to come back to this game again after checking out this opening.} 3. dxe5 fxe5 4. e4 Nf6 5. Bg5 d6 6. Nd5 Be6 {I felt my king side pawn structure was busted ... trying for O-O-O instead.} 7. Bxf6 gxf6 8. Bc4 Bf7 {Not quite sure why I did this. Perhaps I was uncomfortable with the bishop dangling defenselessly at e6 while his knight was in a fairly offensive position?} 9. Ne3 Qd7 10. Qf3 Bg7 11. Ne2 Nc6 12. O-O O-O-O 13. Nd5 {doubling his attack on my weak f pawn.} Bxd5 {So I felt the need for the trade.} 14. Bxd5 {Not quite sure if 14 exd5 would have been better for him. My knight would have to go away and his pawn would still remain very defensible while being stuck literally right down my throat.} Ne7 15. Bf7 Rdf8 16. Bh5 Kb8 {Had to take the time to keep my king safe.} 17. c4 c6 18. b4 f5 19. a4 {That was a little alarming. Especially if he manages to put some pieces behind that pawn structure for the final push towards my king after the pawns poke holes into his defenses.} fxe4 20. Qxe4 d5 {Gonna use my numerical advantage to reduce the queen side threat while driving his queen away.} 21. Qc2 Qf5 22. Qxf5 Rxf5 23. Bg4 Rg5 24. f3 e4 {My turn to poke a little hole in his defenses.} 25. Rae1 exf3 26. Bxf3 dxc4 27. h4 Re5 28. Rec1 b5 29. Nd4 Kc7 30. Bg4 {Freeing his f rook and trying for a e6 fork on my bishop I believe.} Bh6 31. Rca1 a6 {Giving him dominion over the a file but I preserve the pawn structure.} 32. Ne6+ Kd6 33. Kh1 {Not quite sure why he thought Be3  was so deadly that he decided to give me some tempo.} Nd5 {Decided that the b4 pawn was "it".} 34. Rad1 Rxe6 {Learned this trick from an earlier game. I needed numerical superiority more than raw power at this point. Decided to throw a rook in exchange for fewer pieces on his side getting in my way.} 35. Bxe6 Kxe6 36. a5 {Not sure why he did this. Was he afraid of bxa4? In the face of 2 rooks, I'd rather keep that pawn structure intact. Anyway, that bought me another tempo to bring my rook (finally) into action.} Rf8 37. Rfe1+ {He wisely declined the poisoned exchange hehe.} Kd7 38. g4 Bf4 {I had to get my bishop out before I am forced to lose time doing the same thing later when his pawns are dangerously closer.} 39. Rd4 {Not sure what he wanted to achieve with that since my bishop was very well guarded.} c3 {So, I took the extra time to push the pawn and threaten to promote it on a square I control at c1. If he failed to do anything about it, he would have to lose a rook to prevent the promotion.} 40. Re2 Bd2 {Rook for a Bishop pawn looked like a good exchange at this point. I cannot remember if I was trying to prevent Rc2 (which does not seem so bad to me now) or whether I was vacating f4 so my rook could go there for a devastating attack on his pawns, effectively forcing him to trade rooks.} 41. g5 Rf4 42. Rxf4 Nxf4 {I think I preferred Nxf4 to Bxf4 because it deters h5 and g6 while also forcing his rook to go away.} 43. Rf2 {He really should not have done that, there was no threat on the knight so it simply gives me another tempo to get my king away from the d file. The reason will be clear in the later moves.  } Ke7 44. Kh2 c2 {If my king was still in d7, this would not have been possible. Promotion was inevitable now.} 45. Rf1 c1=Q 46. Rxc1 Bxc1 47. Kg3 Kf7 {The rationale for this was to prevent his king from doing anything useful king side. His pawns are already stuck queen side.} 48. Kg4 Kg6 49. Kf3 Kh5 50. Kg3 {Not good for him ... if he wanted a shot at a draw, he should have started going queen side.} Ng6 51. Kf3 Nxh4+ 52. Ke4 Kxg5 53. Ke5 Bd2 54. Kd6 Bxb4+ {Figured I can afford to trade pawns since I can pretty much guarantee the h pawn promotion.} 55. Kxc6 Bxa5 56. Kb7 b4 57. Kxa6 Bd8 {was tempted to give the bishop away, but it was not necessary.} 58. Kb5 b3 59. Kb4 b2 60. Kc3 b1=Q 61. Kc4 Qd1 62. Kc5 h5 {this is just silliness on my part, couldn't quite figure out a quick way of mating, so I kinda decided on the 2nd queen.} 63. Kc4 Nf3 {It was only at this point (when I was forced to move the knight away to pursue my original plan) did I realize the knight allowed the queen much better opportunities to corner the king.} 64. Kc5 Qd4+ 65. Kc6 Ne5+ 66. Kb5 {He had a better position to head toward, but it's just as well. gg} Qc4# {}
