1. e4 {This is a game where my pieces work harmoniously together.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 {Going into the four knights.} 4. Bb5 {rather than the common move in the four knights bishop to c4 i like the ruy lopez position for my bishop.} d6 5. O-O Be7 6. d4 Bd7 7. d5 Nb8 8. a4 a6 9. Be2 O-O 10. Nd2 {Clearing way for f pawn advance.} c6 11. f4 cxd5 12. exd5 exf4 13. Rxf4 Qb6+ 14. Kh1 Qc5 {Here is where the game gets really interesting. Enjoy the ride. } 15. Nc4 {Allowing bishop to move.} b5 16. Be3 {Ignoring threat of him taking my knight since my threat of taking his queen is stronger. I love how the piece being attacked is the piece defending the bishop.} Qb4 17. Nb6 {Discovered threat as well as direct threat of taking his rook. I was hoping he would see the direct threat and react by moving his rook and thus losing his queen but he saw the discovered threat.} Qxb2 {I could take rook but then I would lose knight and have bishop under attack so chose to double attack his knight threaten a discovered attack on his queen and protect the knight and still be threatening to take his rook all in one move.} 18. Bd4 g5 {seeing My position is better trade rook in order to get two of his minor pieces and still have discovered threat as well as threat on his rook still.} 19. Rxf6 Bxf6 20. Bxf6 b4 {CouldnÂ´t help but laught that he took away his only escape square for his queen. And am pleased to win his queen.} 21. Ne4 Qxa1 22. Bxa1 {Could have taken with bishop or queen but saw that by taking with bishop I would have the threat of knight check winning his bishop through a discovered check and then trading his rook for my knight. Also currently threatening to take his rook still so I still have two threats.} Ra7 23. Nf6+ {He removed one threat but this one was simply game. I hope you guys liked how many threats I had going constantly due to my pieces working together so well. It made the game quite fun to play.}
