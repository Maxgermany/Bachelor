1. e4 {Ah, so here I am, playing a game I predicted that I'd lose against acrewboy02. At only -5.7 for a loss, I kinda decided "Ah what the hell! It'll be fun." And it was; We chatted the entire game and I'd like to think that I did reasonably well, but awesome knightplay on his part (And one hell of a pawn) cost me the game. I look forward to playing him again soon! Rawrs!! Standard opening for me. } c5 {Standard responce from him. Or so I'm told...  <_< >_>} 2. d4 {In hindsight, that was probably a bad move...} cxd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6 4. Qe3 {Yeah... that happened back in school, too. This makes me wonder if those other people from that other school practice "official" openings. My school just winged it...} d6 {And so the Battle of Middle-Board begins!} 5. f4 g6 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. h4 {I know it looks stupid (and throughout the game, it only seems to make less and less sense), but it was actually meant to stop g5, because I didn't want to lose any power on e5, where I wanted to push my pawn.} Bg4 {I probably asked for that. That bishop really annoyed me!} 8. Nbd2 Qa5 9. c3 e6 10. Be2 {... Oh, that's right, I wanted to close off the queen's area while being able to attack the white bishop.} h5 {countermeasure against the Bishop?} 11. Bd1 {That was a bad move, says I. I mean, I spent 2 turns to move a bishop a grand total of 2 spaces...} Nge7 {That move really annoyed me later in game.} 12. a3 O-O 13. Qd3 Rfd8 14. b4 Qc7 15. O-O {I later thought that it might've been better to castle along the queenside...} d5 16. Nh2 dxe4 17. Qe3 {I  completely forgot about that rook back there! This move signals the beginning of the end of this game.} Bxd1 18. Rxd1 f5 19. Bb2 {I meant that more to defend my other rook than guard my pawns. I was planning on playing Nc4, but...} Rd3 {... he already thought of that, it seems. } 20. Qf2 {I was just thinking now: Qc5 probablly would've been better...} Bxc3 21. Bxc3 Rxc3 {I hate his exchange rate. :P} 22. Ndf1 Rd8 23. Qe1 Rcd3 24. g3 {I had to do something... I was thinking either b5 or g3...} b5 {too late! X.x} 25. Kg2 {I actually meant Kf2, not g2. That sucked! x.x;;} Rd8d6 26. Kf2 Qd7 {...and it gave him an extra turn to line up...} 27. Ke2 Rd6d4 28. Rd2 Nd5 29. Rad1 Nc3+ {With that, We both agreed he won, but to keep playing anyways.} 30. Kf2 Nxd1+ 31. Qxd1 Rd3xd2+ 32. Nxd2 Rxd2+ 33. Qe2 Rxe2+ 34. Kxe2 Qd3+ 35. Kf2 Qxa3 36. Nf1 Qxb4 37. Nd2 {I meant to play Ne3... don't know what the hell I was thinking there...} Qxd2+ 38. Kg1 {Ha ha ha, here I said to cue the clown/carnival music for my death march...} b4 39. Kf1 b3 40. Kg1 b2 41. Kh1 {My king went to cry in a corner...} b1=R# {And that's that. Game, set, and match.}
