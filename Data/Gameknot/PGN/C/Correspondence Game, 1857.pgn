[Opening "KP (B00), Nimzovich defence, Marshall gambit"]

1. e4 {Never a bad choice.} Nc6 {A reply that would later be attached to the name of the great Latvian, Aron Niemzowitsch. Here Wake uses it merely to direct the game out of the usual channels.} 2. d4 {Placing the Pawn here in spite of Black's opening move.} d5 {Preventing P-Q5 driving the Knight.} 3. e5 {Seizing the black squares, but leaving his KP advanced and exposed.} Bf5 {Counterattack along the white squares.} 4. Ne2 {To guard the base QP, but N-KB3 would be a better choice. If then 4... B-N5, 5 B-K3 develops and safeguards the QP. 4 N-KB3 would also allow the development of the KB and a quick K-side castle.} Nb4 {Taking advantage of White's tangled development. If White had played 4 N-KB3, he would be in a position to block the diagonal of the B with an eventual B-Q3. } 5. Na3 {Virtually forced.} c5 {Applying further pressure to White's position.} 6. c3 {IF White had played 4 N-KB3, this move would be strong, as the Black Knight would be forced to retreat. With the KB controlling Q3, Black's best move would be 6... N-QR3, guarding the QBP and preparing R-B1. However...} Nd3+ {...because of White's mistake on move 4, Black wins at once with this move. After 7 K-Q2, Black wins the Exchange with 7... NxKBP forking Q and R.}
