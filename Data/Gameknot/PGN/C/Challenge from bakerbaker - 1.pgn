[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C61), Bird's defence, Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 {I was White in this game where I pawnstormed my opponent.} e5 {This is the most logical response, but symmetry is usually favorable to the side with the tempo. The Sicilian Defense (1...c5) is the best way to try for an advantage as Black.} 2. Nf3 {The most logical move. I develop a kingside piece while attacking a pawn in the centre.} Nc6 3. Bb5 {This is the Ruy Lopez, or Spanish Opening. I develop my bishop to the most active square.} Nd4 {Supposedly this is advantageous to White, but this move avoids the well analyzed main lines of the Ruy Lopez. Instead, Black accepts doubled pawns and a kingside pawn minority, in order to leave my bishop on an unimportant diagonal, and Black will usually have more experience in this opening than a normal Ruy-Lopez Player.} 4. Nxd4 exd4 {Now there are a lot of imbalances in the position. I am ahead in development and have a kingside pawn majority, but Black may be able to gain tempo chasing my bishop. There are a few common plan choices here. One is to ignore my bishop and play O-O and c3, taking advantage of Black's weak pawn by trying to trade it for a flank pawn, strengthening my pawn centre. A more passive, but safer plan is to play c4 and Qe2, which greatly increases my control of the light squares and makes Black's development more difficult. The plan I chose was the only one I thought would bring me an advantage.} 5. f4 {My plan was to take advantage of my kingside pawn majority, and storm Black's kingside before he has a chance to finish developing. Although my plan probably could've been more promising if I'd played c4 first, keeping my bishop on the a4-e8 diagonal.} Bc5 {It's hard for Black to find active moves in this position. I thought Nf6 was his best try.} 6. Qf3 {Since my knight no longer needs f3, it is free for my queen.} a6 {Black questions my oddly placed bishop.} 7. Be2 {If I'd played c4 earlier, I wouldn't have to retreat like this.} d6 8. d3 {I stop annoying d3  threats if I castle.} c6 {Black is playing passively, while I already have plans of storming the kingside.} 9. O-O Nf6 10. h3 {Intending a g4 boost.} O-O {This is definitely "castling into it."} 11. g4 h6 {Black can't do much in this position. A common result of playing the opening too passively.} 12. Qg2 {I reposition my forces before attacking.} Nh7 {Black's defense is too late.} 13. g5 {My attack comes just in time.} hxg5 14. fxg5 {Now I have an open f-file and a strong g-pawn. Even though I only have my queen and rook in the attack, I should be able to crush his position once I get the h-pawn rolling.} Be6 15. h4 Qd7 {A cheap threat of Bh3.} 16. Rf2 {I calmly stop his threat.} b5 17. h5 {Black will be lost in a few moves, because he isn't defending or counterattacking.} a5 {Black's queenside attack attempt is nothing.} 18. Rf4 {I should've played this earlier, because I need my rook on the h-file to complete my attack.} Bb6 {Clearly Black has no idea what to do and is making random moves. Either he underestimates my strong attack, or he can't find suitable defensive moves and is waiting to lose.} 19. Rh4 c5 {Another passive move is all it takes to lose. Now Black probably can't recover.} 20. g6 {This pawn cannot be captured, because after I recapture, Black is in big trouble on the wide open h-file after Qh2.} Nf6 21. h6 {Now my attack is too much. One way or another, I will open the h-file and pile it with my heavy pieces. } gxh6 {A better chance is fxg6, but Black is still lost because after hxg7, an array of tactical threats will beat Black to a pulp. } 22. Bxh6 {There are probably many ways to win here. I thought about playing g7, and Rxh6, but once I knew I had a winning position, I didn't really care how I finished it.} Rfc8 {This move loses immediately, although Black can't really do anything else. If he leaves his rook hanging, I will still have a lot of tactical threats, and Black doesn't have any possibilities for a counterattack, since my king is perfectly safe, despite having no pawn cover. Although my king may become weak if Black survives my attack.} 23. gxf7+ {Black can resign now. He is going to be mated soon, but in case he didn't resign, the last moves are conditional moves.} Kxf7 {Kh8 and Kh7 get mated by Qg7#.} 24. Qg7+ {But Black is still going to be mated.} Ke8 25. Qf8# {Even if Black wasn't blocked in my his own queen, I'd still be forking his knight.}
