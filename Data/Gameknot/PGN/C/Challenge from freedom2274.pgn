1. e4 {a good game by my opponent, helped at the beginning by a stupid distraction from my side, but he deserved the victory for the nice behaviour until the end. -or, how to exploit quietly a small advantage.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 d6 5. Nc3 Nf6 {and this is my first distraction: i was playing Najdorf... and all of sudden I forgot to play the key move a6... But though, here it is still viable.} 6. Bg5 e6 {not yet a mistake} 7. Qd2 h6 {inaccuracy, but not a mistake.} 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 {this is the mistake. A "better" move would have been gxf.} 9. Ndb5 {and this is how to } Qd8 {forced} 10. O-O-O {nice shot} a6 {forcing the encounter.} 11. Nxd6+ Bxd6 12. Qxd6 Qxd6 13. Rxd6 {results of the inaccuracy. One pawn up and an execllent rook + a better developpement.} Ke7 {best answer. Maybe my best move of the game.} 14. Rd2 b5 15. Be2 {developping quietly and intelligently} Bd7 {i have hesitated with Bd7, but I don't see what is better, anyway.} 16. Rhd1 Ra7 17. f4 {now white will take profit of its advantage.} g5 {tempting to create a hole in the defense.} 18. g3 Na5 {chasing too many rabbits.} 19. Rd2d4 {good guess} Nc6 20. Rd4d6 Rc8 {coordinating the forces. I had to think: it is only one pawn, it is only one pawn... but freedom is claerly clever.} 21. e5 {only the knight could chase this strong rook now.} Na5 {so, it moves.} 22. Ne4 {entering in the game.} gxf4 {forced.} 23. Nf6 {but i am pretty sure this was his goal since move 21.} Bc6 24. gxf4 Nc4 {chasing the rook... or provoking exchange?} 25. Bxc4 bxc4 {worsing the structure. Now, I had no more hope... I just continued because Freedom deserved the game.} 26. Rd1d4 Bb5 {my bishop loses all efficiency} 27. c3 {"Toi qui entres ici, abandonne toute esp√©rance..." My last hope (if ever) to enter into c-column is broken.} Raa8 {playing for playing. Avoiding mistakes that could lead to a dangerous mate net with king and knight.} 28. h4 {preparing the capture of h-pawn and the advancing of his.} Ra7 29. h5 Raa8 30. f5 {did not expect that. if exf, then Nd5+!} Rc5 {trying to attack another piece of cake... if i can take this pawn, i can threat the rooks.} 31. Nd7 {intersting!} Rd5 {interesting? Llok at the serie: R(whatever)xd5 exd5 could lead to some complications for white.} 32. f6+ {but No! White chose the best answer!} Ke8 {forced} 33. Rd6xd5 exd5 34. Nb6 {escaping from the trap.} Rd8 35. Nxd5 {and taking one more pawn.} Rd7 {of course not Bc6, that would lead to a mortal Nc7+} 36. Ne3 {re-focusing on h6} Rc7 37. Nf5 Rc5 38. Re4 Bc6 39. Re3 Bd7 40. Nxh6 Be6 41. Ng8 Bf5 42. Ne7 Bh7 43. b4 {there is no more defence... Congratulations, freedom}
