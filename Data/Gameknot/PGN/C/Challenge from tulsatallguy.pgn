1. e4 {The most common opening on GameKnot.} Nc6 2. Nf3 e5 3. Bb5 Nf6 {Basic posturing.} 4. O-O Bc5 5. Nxe5 {This surprised me.  I thought fianchetto52 would not want to strike at this point.} Nxe5 6. d4 Bd6 7. dxe5 Bxe5 8. f4 Bd6 9. e5 {Luckily I could apply some pressure on his king and save both my knight and my bishop!} Bc5+ 10. Kh1 Ne4 11. Qf3 c6 {If I had know about the en passant capture, I may have moved a6 instead.  But I learned about the en passant on this game so that was valuable moving forward in future games.} 12. Ba4 d5 13. exd6 e.p. {When I first saw this I was like, "Wha?"  This really tripped me up.  This was new to me and great for me to learn.} Bf5 14. Nc3 Nxd6 15. Bxc6+ {Really had to think this one through.  It may have been better for me to take the bait and just kill fianchetto52's bishop with my pawn.  Guess I will not know.} Ke7 16. Bd5 g6 17. g4 Rg8 {This move was unconventional but I wanted to control g after fianchetto52 took my bishop then I took his pawn with mine.  I was hoping this sacrifice would give the positional advantage.  In the end fianchetto52 played too well and never let me develop my strategy.  } 18. gxf5 gxf5 19. Re1+ Kd7 {Maybe f8 would have been better?} 20. Bxb7 Qh4 21. Be3 {I was hoping that fianchetto52 would not make this move, but alas!  He's a strong player.} Rae8 22. Qc6+ Kd8 {This was the beginning of the end for me.  fianchetto52 kept me on the defensive and never let up.} 23. Qxc5 Rg6 24. Rad1 Ree6 25. Qc8+ Ke7 26. Nd5# {Well done Mike!  This was a good, thoughtful game and I really enjoyed it!}
