Kf2 {My King has to defend the K-side squares.} Ra2+ 50. Kg1 {Now the Rook can't access my KR2.} Rc2 51. b4 {Black chases my Q-side Pawns.} Rb2 52. c6 {Withe the Black K cut off from the Q-side, the Rook is overburdened.} Rc2 53. b5 {Black can't be on both files at once.} Rb2 54. c7 {Black resigns, as the Pawn cannot be stopped.}
