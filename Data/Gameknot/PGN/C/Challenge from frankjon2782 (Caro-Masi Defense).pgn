1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kann and variations fascinate me, so I've decided to start learning it.  However, I find some of the moves counter-intuitive so I never yet have played it straight.} 2. d4 {Take the middle; fair enough.} Nf6 {If 3. e5, then Nd5 anchors the middle for Black for a bit.  3. ... Ne4 seems too risky, even if 4. f3 weakens the King-side for White a bit.} 3. Nc3 d6 {Not 3. ...d5, where 4. e5 drives the knight back to d7 (4. ... Ng4 is chased by 5. h3).} 4. Nf3 g6 {Must castle to free the Queen-side for action.  The fiancetto is the fastest way to accomplish this.} 5. Bf4 {Not bad in itself as it develops the bishop, but I wonder whether 5. c4 threatening 6. Ng5 might have been better for maintaining tempo for White.} Bg7 6. Bc4 O-O {White is fully developed on the most standard lines, barring castling.  Black is relatively undeveloped, especially hampered by the Queen's knight, but quite safe for the mean time.} 7. Qe2 {A curious move.  It looks like an attempt to force the issue on e5, while supporting the c4 bishop as well.  Not necessarily a bad idea, but perhaps castling first was in order, forcing Black to move out, where he has few options.} Nfd7 {Threatens the newly-uncovered QP, but probably unwise, as it stunts Black's Queen-side further.} 8. Rd1 Nb6 9. b3 e6 10. O-O d5 11. exd5 exd5 12. Bg5 Bf6 13. Bxf6 Qxf6 {By pursuing the exchange, White has gained the e column, but lost some of his developmental advantage.} 14. Bd3 Bf5 {The more indirect Bg4 might be better positionally.} 15. Qe3 Nb8d7 16. Ne5 Bxd3 17. Nxd7 Nxd7 18. Rxd3 Rfe8 {Which is worse - Black's useless knight or White's awkward Rook?} 19. Qh3 Nb6 20. Qg4 Re6 {Blocks the Queen from the back rank and prepares to double the rooks.} 21. f4 {Why?  Most logically, to give the Queen a shield for Qf3 and regroup.  The Rook on the open column gives Black the attack.} Rae8 22. f5 {Qd1 was more in order.} Re6e1 23. Rdf3 Qe7 24. fxg6 {A fair attack as far as it goes.} Rxf1+ 25. Kxf1 {Correct was 25. Rxf1 hxg6 which at least leaves White in the game.} Qe1# {Game.}
