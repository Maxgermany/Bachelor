1. f4 {I am very unfamiliar, and often uncomfortable with black when facing f4 or c4. I didn't use any opening book or database, and just played what felt right in the opening. I'm not sure where we left book, but I guess it was pretty early.} d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. b3 Bg4 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bb2 Nbd7 6. Be2 Be7 7. O-O h5 {Probably dubious. Right now all I had was a vague idea of trying to open up lines along the kingside.} 8. d3 Bc5 {Played to induce weakness at e4, strengthening it for use as a N outpost later on.} 9. d4 {Black now has no control over e4. However white has strengthened hold over e5. But as the game proceeds, e5 is never really the focus of any activity, whereas e4 almost constantly is.} Be7 10. c4 {Challanging the pawn which is holding e4} Ne4 11. Nc3 Ndf6 12. Nd2 {fight is all around e4. white can't keep black from posting a N here, but can definately exchange to reduce pressure} Bxe2 13. Qxe2 Nxd2 14. Qxd2 Bb4 15. f5 {I think white could have done better here. The idea behind f5 is to give black problems with his center. Although I think the idea is right, it's implementation should have waited for a little. The reason i say this is that 15.f5 leaves white's queen bottled in for a few moves after 17.Bxe3. That gives black time to choose a plan of action at will. However, considering that black has not yet castled, and already has a weak looking K-side, white should try to make things more complicated for black over the next few moves, and I think the way to do that would be to keep the Q more active, and then play f4. For example, 15.Qc2 or Qd3 look to be promising. After 15..Bxc3 16.Qxc3 Ne4 17.Qb4 b6 18.f5 the position is the same as it would be after 17.Bxc3 in this game, with the important differences that black: has 'holes' in his Q-side, cannot play Qg5 (or any other attacking move), cannot safely castle on either side of the board. Additionally, white's Q is better on b4 than it would be on c2.} Ne4 16. Qc2 Bxc3 {N at e4 very powerful. white's e-pawn backward and undefended} 17. Bxc3 Qg5 {Attacks white's backward pawn, and brings in the Q to the side of the board where white's king is. I think this would be one of the problems with an advance of the f-pawn in the opening - a weak center pawn.} 18. Rf4 {Interesting. White could also have played Rae1 or Rf3. I haven't looked deep into this, but Rf3 seems to have the advantage of the R being protected, and it also allows the R to move along the 3rd rank without fear for the e-pawn.} O-O-O {!? allows interesting attacks for both sides. I could have kept the K in the center, but that wouldn't have allowed me to push forward on the K-side. Since white seems to have a inactive Q at the moment, and more pawn-problems than I, it seemed that it would be a good idea to send the K off to the other side of the board, and march forward on this side. But now white can press on with the pawns on the Q-side. All seems like a matter of who's attack is more fast and more sure.} 19. Ba5 {Threatening cxd5 with mate on c7. More importantly, bringing the B to life.} Rd7 {Only good way of protecting myself. b6 is unnecesarily weakening, Qe7 is unwanted retreat.} 20. b4 {pawn march. This move scared me a bit when it was played. If black isn't fast enough on the K-side, these pawns could eventually pawn me off!} exf5 21. c5 {I was expecting 21.cxd5 instead. That would have opened up the c file, and the Q would have been able to exert influence, maybe the a1 R could also join in the fun. After 21.cxd5 b6 the bishop isn't lost for nothing, because of the very nice continuation: 22.Bxb6 axb6 23.Qc6! Rd6 (otherwise Qa8  ) 24.Rc1 Qe7 25.Rxf5 and black is helpless (for example the threat of Re5).} Rh6 {To prevent the threat of c6 followed by cxb7 and the opening of the c-file putting black's K in danger.} 22. b5 {Moving on with the plan of marching the pawns forward. I still think that it would have been better for white to somehow open the c-file. The Q is so powerless in the current situation. Alternatively if white had brought it forward as suggested in my comments on 15.f5, prospects would have been brighter.} h4 {My turn to march a pawn! Aim is obvious; since white is posing no serious imminent threats on the Q-side, I will now try to weaken the position around white's K with my pawn, and then bring in my heavy pieces.} 23. Rb1 {Too slow! Achieves absolutely nothing! White will not even have time to get his pawns out of the way for the R to be able to do anything} h3 24. g4 {Simply g3 would have been better I think. The pawn would be stronger there, protected by the h-pawn.} c6 {Probably not needed, could have played fxg4 straight away. But I was slightly wary of c6 by white. No harm being a bit overcautious, though.} 25. Qe2 fxg4 26. bxc6 Rxc6 27. Rxg4 Qh5 {Pinning the R. Only move which doesn't loose material is Re1 (or b2) - to protect the queen. After f5 by black, and a subseuqnet exchange of Qs, black should be able to spoil white's central pawn chain with b6, and push his connected K-side pawns. It is a bit unclear, but I think black would definately be better.} 28. Rxg7 {?? decisive mistake. Perhaps white thought that he was now threating mate on the back rank and also attacking black's queen. However he missed the simple continuation which black went on to play.} Rg6+ {and now, at worst, black wins a R for a N.} 29. Rxg6 Qxg6+ {the only moves for white are Kh1 or Kf1. In either case black may play Ng3, forcing white to take the N, leaving black at the liberty to then play Qxb1. Black's advantage is now almost certainly winning.} 30. Kf1 Ng3+ 31. hxg3 Qxb1+ 32. Be1 f6 33. a4 Rg7 34. Qf3 h2 35. Qxd5 Qh7 36. Qh1 Qd3+ {}
