1. d4 {Me v William helping to improve his play.  Queen pawn 2 nice standard opening} f5 {I'll follow up with this} 2. h4 {Strange opening. I think this is pretty weak IMO as it is not attacking the centre squares.} Nf6 {I'll continue my development} 3. h5 {This is confusing because it is unorthodox.  I obviously cant take it yet and now it cant go anywhere so I think it is a wasted move.} e6 {So I am moving here which might look pretty weak but it is now opening up access for my bishop and queen.} 4. Nc3 {That's more of a standard move attacking the centre of the board.} Bb4 {I will pin his knight and develop my bishop.} 5. Qd2 {Don't see the point of this move as he still cant move his knight without sacrificing his queen.} Nc6 {So i'll attackd4 and develop my knight} 6. a3 {I don't mind this move.  He obviously wants my bishop to move.  I first thought of taking his knight but.....} Ne4 {I thought about attacking his queen.  he cant capture my knight or bishop without losing his queen and when I do capture his knight next move I assume he will have to capture my knight back with his b pawn disturbing his pawn formation.} 7. Qd3 {As I thought } Bxc3+ {now I check him capturing knight and doubling up his pawn} 8. bxc3 {Pawns doubled} b6 {now lets give my bishop a chance to come out} 9. Nf3 {Developing his knight} Bb7 {Outcomes my bishop.  I believe this gives me a strong attack of the diagonal} 10. Ne5 {I'm not sure why he's done this.  Perhaps bring out the f pawn to move my knight} Nxe5 {I'll take it anyway and double up two more pawns still controlling the diagonal with my bishop} 11. dxe5 {as suspected} Qe7 {I've done this primarily because I want to castle queen side. f6 g5 and h4 don't work and this will allow me to move my queen to c5 attacking e5 f2 and c3} 12. Rh4 {I'm not sure why he's moved there surely he will not take my knight and lose his rook.} Qc5 {as said previously attacking c3 e5 and f2 - f2 could be mate in two if all goes to plan and he doesn't spot it.} 13. Be3 {Well that has stopped the mate in two but...} Qxe5 {I capture e5} 14. Bf4 {I assume this is to attack my queen and c7 pawn but this forces me back on to c5.} Qc5 {Back on c5 and possibility of mate in 2} 15. f3 {That's a blunder and gives me the game. mate in two} Qf2+ {check!! one option kd1 mate next move.} 16. Kd1 {Kd1} Qxf1# {Checkmate}
