1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. c3 cxd4 7. cxd4 {The French Defence. I did'nt like that Knight on d2, eventually white gets his d2 Knight to f3 and his g1 Knight to g3 via e2. In my previous games in that position white has had a good attack hence my next move, trying to stop that.} Bb4 {This move is no good! I won't be playing again, it just wastes time.} 8. Ngf3 {It has stopped white placing a Knight on g3 though!} Nc6 9. a3 Be7 10. b4 a6 11. Bd3 f5 12. O-O {Panic struck in here. Whats whites plan? f5 was instinctive to stop f5 by white, whites pieces are aiming at the kingside, so I made another bad move to try and stop any attack.} Nf8 13. Nb3 b6 14. Be3 Ng6 15. Rc1 Bd7 16. Kh1 {This is looking very bad, an attack down the c file.} O-O 17. Rg1 {An attack down the g file?} Rf7 {????} 18. Qe2 Nb8 19. Rc2 Ba4 {I know its probably hard to beleive in this position, but that Bishop acctually saves the game.} 20. Rc3 Bf8 21. Ng5 {Did'nt see this coming, good move.} Re7 22. Nd2 Nc6 23. g4 {I had the feeling during the game that Black would shortly be in zuzwang. Plus, I'd used about 45 mins at this point, white had used about 20 mins.} Nxd4 {Hey ho! I think the poker term is all-in!} 24. Bxd4 Nxf4 25. Qf3 Nxd3 26. Qxd3 {Although a piece down for two pawns, thats releived a bit of pressure.} h6 27. Nxe6 {I'm getting my piece back?!? As White, I would'nt have done this.} Rxe6 28. gxf5 {All square} Rc6 29. f6 Rxc3 30. Bxc3 d4 {This move saves the game for me I think, White has to be aware of the Bishop coming to c6 with check.} 31. Qc4+ Kh8 32. fxg7+ Bxg7 33. Rxg7 Kxg7 34. Bxd4 {My King is vunerable here hence the little walk.} Kf8 35. Be3 Ke8 36. Bxh6 Qe7 37. Qe4 Rc8 38. Qg6+ Qf7 39. Qxf7+ Kxf7 40. Kg1 Ke6 41. h4 Rc3 42. Bg7 {The blunder.} Rg3+ {}
