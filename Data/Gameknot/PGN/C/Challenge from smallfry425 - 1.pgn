1. e4 {My standard opening as white.} e5 {Not surprised. Seen this an awful lot.} 2. Nf3 {We follow the book for the next few moves.} Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 {Avoiding 4. Nc3 with the fork trick.} Bc5 5. Nc3 Ng4 {? Loses a pawn after 6. Bxf7+! Kxf7 7. Ng5+ followed by Qxg4.} 6. O-O {? Misses the petite combination.} d6 7. h3 Nf6 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bh4 O-O 10. Nd5 Be6 {? Best was 10...g5. Now I get to play...} 11. Nxf6+ {11.Nxf6+! I rip open the pawnshield or get a knight in the bag.} gxf6 {Black recaptures, but his king is weak.} 12. Nh2 {I plan to manouver my knight to g4 after the queen to h5.} Bxc4 {The saying "When under attack, trade pieces" is happening right now.} 13. dxc4 {I take back.} a6 14. Qg4+ {I make a stop at g4 before going to h5 for no apparent reason.} Kh8 {King just slides over.} 15. Qh5 {Now I move my queen away so my knight can come to g4.} Kh7 {?? Mate in 6.} 16. Ng4 {Now I have 3 pieces in the fight, hitting h6 and f6.} Re8 {?? Not the best D. To stave off mate you had to sack the bishoip on c5. Now it is mate in 4.} 17. Bxf6 {?? Drops the mate in 4. Best was 17. Qxh5. A king is better than Q+R.} Qxf6 {Has to sack queen. Any other queen move loses to 18. Qxh6 followed by mate.} 18. Nxf6+ Kg7 19. Nxe8+ Rxe8 {And now I have P+Q+R for 2 minors. +9 points. The rest is history.} 20. Rad1 Nb4 21. Rd2 b5 22. c3 Nc6 23. b4 Bb6 24. Rd3 Re6 25. c5 dxc5 26. Rd7 {?? Blunder. It offers black better D chances. Much better was Rf3.} Rg6 27. bxc5 Bxc5 28. Rxc7 b4 29. Qf5 Be7 30. cxb4 Rg5 31. Qd7 Rg6 32. Rxc6 {I get more pieces off the board...} Rxc6 33. Qxc6 {+13 points (+12 if Bxb4) and Black resigns.}
