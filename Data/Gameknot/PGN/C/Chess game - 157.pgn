[Opening "Scotch (C45), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {The Scotch game. There are several moves to play here.} Qh4 {This is the most aggressive move.} 5. Nc3 {Nb5 is also possible which is the Horwitz attack but I think it just loses a pawn.} Bc5 {I think black forgot some theory about this line. I play } 6. Be3 {Develops a piece and protects d4. } d6 {A rather passive move. Defends c5. I didn't want to capture on c6 as it would give him an open b file. Also it loses after Bxe3.} 7. Bc4 f5 {Challenges my central control and if 8. Exf5 then Nxd4 wins. I'm in a pretty tricky positino and I probably have already blundered.} 8. Ncb5 {Going for some counterplay. Attacks c7 and threatens a rather uselss fork since black won't be using that rook for a while.} Qxe4 9. Nxc7+ Kd7 10. Nxa8 Bxd4 11. Qd2 {The wrong move. Better was Qe2.} f4 {This move just kills me. The pawn and bishop are immune due to the pin down the e file.} 12. O-O-O {Protects b2 and creates a battery down the d file.} fxe3 {Fxe3 fails miserably to Ne3 winning the queen.} 13. Qe2 Nf6 14. f3 Qg6 15. Rhe1 Ke7 {Black gets ready to move the light square bishop while attacking the knight simultaneously.} 16. Rd3 {I was considering an exchange sac on e3 but then again I'm going to be too much material.} Re8 {My position is hopeless so I just try to axchange some wood to get the game getting somewhere.} 17. Rxe3+ Bxe3+ 18. Qxe3+ Kf8 19. Qg1 {A dubious move} Bf5 {Attacks the knight on a8 and c2.} 20. Rxe8+ Kxe8 21. Nc7+ Kd7 22. Nb5 Bxc2 23. Nxa7 {I spot the free pawn so I immediately capture it to try to regain as much material.} Bb1 {Prepares mate on c2. Kd1 fails to 24. Kd1  Qc2+ 25. Ke1 Qc1+ 26. Kf2 27. Qxg1+ Kxg1 and after Nxa7 black is up 2 pieces for one pawn. My position is hopeless.} 24. Kd2 {Instead I try Kd2} Qc2+ {Again Ke1 fails to  25. Ke1 Qc2+ 25. Ke1 Qc1+ 26. Kf2 27. Qxg1+ Kxg1 But regardless of the enxt white king move white will lose the knight on a7.} 25. Ke3 Nxa7 {Trying to keep the game as complicated as possible by not exchanging queens. Note how the bishop is still up for grabs.} 26. Be2 d5 {Pawn storming now. Black knows that he will easily win.} 27. Kf2 d4 28. Qd1 {This was forced since d3 would be crushing.} Qxd1 29. Bxd1 {He happily accepts a 2 pieces lead.} d3 30. Ke3 b5 31. Bb3 Nc6 32. Bf7 h5 33. h3 h4 34. Bg6 Nb4 35. a3 Nc6 {I manage to grab another pawn.} 36. Bxd3 Bxd3 37. Kxd3 {I could be able to still salvage a draw.} g5 38. Kc3 Kd6 39. b3 Kc5 40. a4 bxa4 41. bxa4 Ne5 42. Kb3 Nd3 43. Ka3 Nf2 44. a5 Kb5 45. Kb3 Kxa5 { My king is too far from the pawns and his two knight should be able to secure the victory.} 46. Kc3 Nd5+ 47. Kd2 Nf4 48. Ke3 Nf2d3 49. Kd2 Nf2 50. Ke3 Nh1 51. Kd4 Nxg2 52. Ke4 Nf4 53. Ke3 Nxh3 54. Ke2 Nf4+ {I just wanted to play on to see what would happen.} 55. Kf1 Ng3+ 56. Kf2 Kb4 57. Ke1 Kc3 58. Kf2 Kd3 59. Ke1 Ke3 60. Kd1 Kxf3 61. Kc2 h3 62. Kb2 h2 63. Kb3 h1=Q 64. Kb4 Qc1 65. Kb5 Qc3 66. Kb6 Ke4 67. Kb7 Qc4 68. Kb8 Qc5 69. Kb7 Kd5 70. Kb8 {I just resigned here. It wouldn't be too hard to win as black from here. I'm on 2/7 points. The leaders are on 3/7 points.} Kd6 71. Kb7 Qc7+ 72. Ka6 Qb8 73. Ka5 Kc5 74. Ka6 Qb6# {}
