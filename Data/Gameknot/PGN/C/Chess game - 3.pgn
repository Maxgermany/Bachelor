1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O {Main line in the king's Indian.} 6. h3 {I see this a lot restricting black's light squared bishop.  Unfortunately if this is really the new line ( I'm a little older ) then I don't know it.} c6 7. Bd3 a6 8. a4 {White prevents b5.} Nbd7 {So black prepares e5.} 9. O-O e5 10. d5 cxd5 11. cxd5 Nc5 {Most of the time white players retreat the bishop to c2 but white makes the choice of active knight traded for the 'bad' (maybe) bishop here.  There is the platitude that exchanging relieves a cramp which is good for black, but white gains space on the queen side.  Interesting trade off.} 12. b4 Nxd3 13. Qxd3 Nh5 {The knight is headed for f4 and if white trades the bishop for the knight the long diagonal is opened, a fairly common strategy.} 14. Bg5 Qb6 {Threatening the pawn on b4 so that black will get to play Nf4.} 15. b5 Nf4 16. Qc4 {I thought 16. Qd2 followed by Ra1c1 might be better but this actually works out well enough.} Bd7 {I was hoping black could use the c file.} 17. Qb4 Nd3 18. Qb1 Nc5 {White wasn't going to take the knight so it heads for a good post.  I thought we might trade queens here with bxa6 and white would have an advantage since black's dark squared bishop has little scope.  It's kind of hard to believe but black's DSB will be a crucial piece.  } 19. a5 {white finds a tactical shot.} Qc7 20. b6 Qc8 21. Be7 {So now black has nothing to lose.  } Bxh3 {I think white should just take the bishop, black hasn't really got anything but complications are the only hope.} 22. Bxf8 Qg4 23. Ne1 {The only defense to mate ( g3 allows Qxf3 )} Bxf8 {Black captures with bishop since the bishop must go to d8 to prevent an invasion by the rooks on the c file.} 24. Qd1 {Being up the exchange white wants to trade down and black has no good options that I can see.} Qxd1 25. Rxd1 Bd7 26. Nf3 f5 27. Rfe1 Nb3 {Winning the pawn on a5.} 28. Rdb1 Nxa5 29. Nd2 {Trying to win the knight with Ra1. So black sets up an escape square.} Rc8 {And threatens the knight on c3} 30. Rec1 Nc4 31. Nxc4 Rxc4 32. f3 {White must protect the pawn on e4 before he moves the knight } Be7 {Black prepares to protect c7 and go after the pawn on b6.} 33. Ne2 Rxc1+ 34. Rxc1 Bd8 {There is only one way to protect the pawn, but its only temporary.} 35. Rb1 Bb5 {Interupting the rooks protection and threatening the knight} 36. Nc3 {Yes black will lose a pawn here if the bishop stays on b5 but he can take the b pawn and activate his DSB.} Bxb6+ 37. Kh2 Bc5 38. Nxb5 axb5 39. Rxb5 b6 {locking up the pawns.  I thought it should be a draw here.} 40. Kg3 Kg7 41. Kh4 Kh6 {I thought white should try to open the position here with exf5 but endgames are not one of my relative strengths.} 42. g4 g5+ 43. Kh3 f4 {Now it's really locked up and should be a draw but white has a plan to give up his rook for the bishop and win the queenside pawns. So ...} 44. Kg2 Kg6 45. Rb1 Be3 46. Kf1 Bc5 47. Ke2 Kf6 {Is white really headed for a6 with his king?  Black's king must guard the pawn on h7 so he's not going very far.} 48. Kd3 Kg6 49. Kc4 {Okay the white king is far enough away now so } h5 {Black could have played 49. Rh1 to stop this.} 50. gxh5+ Kxh5 51. Rh1+ Kg6 52. Rh8 Kg7 {There are lots of chances for repetition here ( 53. Rh5, Kg6  54. Rh8 ... ) } 53. Rb8 {White wants to eat the queenside pawns.} Kg6 {I kept trying to count the moves here but is a 3 minute game I just wasn't sure it was the right time for g4. But it is coming.} 54. Kb5 Kh5 55. Rh8+ Kg6 56. Kc6 Kg7 57. Rd8 {This is a mistake.  It looks like white gives the exchange back and gets a passed d pawn but ...} g4 58. fxg4 f3 59. Ra8 f2 60. Ra1 Kg6 61. Kb5 Kg5 62. Kc4 Kxg4 63. Kd3 Kf3 {The white king now has only two square it can go to d2 and d3, it can't let the black king to g2 unless it can go to e2 and prevent queening.   } 64. Rc1 {all white can do is shuffle the rook.  ( While Kd2 still prevents queening it drops the pawns. )} b5 65. Rf1 b4 66. Kd2 b3 67. Rb1 Bb4+ 68. Kd3 Be1 {White resigns.  Please rate and comment I can use the insights.}
