[Opening "King's pawn game (C44)"]

1. e4 {The usual.  And, as noted in my last annotation, Erika plays the move that I recommended.  Now, someone recommended that I teach students the Sicilian Defense.  The only reason I don't is because the master mater (easy19) said that I shouldn't because that is harder to learn.  The idea being is to start off with the basics, and then, as time progresses and the student improves, that's when you teach more complicated things such as the Sicilian. } e5 2. Nf3 {Nothing new here.} Nc6 {Although it's the most common move, this is something new for Erika.  I have not seen my student play this before.  Usually, she responds with Petrov Defense.  But, @reachforgoals: This is actually the best move because it's most analyzed by masters and Grandmasters.  The idea is that you want play what they analyze the most.  The idea is that it leads to some well known lines, which I'll discuss on his next move.} 3. a3 {?! This, however, is an inaccuracy.  Most common was 3.Bb5 (the Ruy Lopez), 3.Bc4, (The Guaco Piano), or 3.Nf6, the Three Knights Opening.  All three of these moves develop another piece for white, right away.  And, of them, the Ruy Lopez and Guaco Piano allow white to castle safely, at once.  The problem here is that sicliandrsgon isn't developing at all or advancing his d pawn to mobilize his DSB, which also helps to control the center.  By doing so, white has just waisted a tempo, as black will use that time to develop another piece.} Bd6 4. c3 {I'm not sure why sicliandrsgon played this, but it is not the Caro Kann Defense.  Therefore, this waists more time, as we'll see with her next move.} Nf6 5. h3 {Like before, the time could've been used for white to develop another piece or advance his center pawn.  However, he used it to advance a flank (edge) pawn.  In doing so, Erika is much further ahead in development, will get her K safety, and is even closer to controlling the center.  It's hard to make any conclusion, but I'd say that black has the initiative, for now.  In other words, I strongly favor black's position, at this point.} O-O 6. g4 {?! Maybe, to get a pawn chain.  Not only doesn't this develop, though, but with this move, castling short will mean exposing the monarch.  And, as we know, based on my recent game against Jack Stockel and what he's noted, voluntarily exposing your K is a recipe for disaster. } b6 {Fianchettoing, so that Erika's Bc8 can come into play, thus, completing her development.} 7. Ng5 {? Another thing that must be pointed, as now, not only is Erika much further ahead in development and center control, but her opponent has moved the same Knight, unnecessarily.  The idea being here is that, in addition to what I mentioned, unless there is a good reason for doing so, you should not move the same piece more then once.  And, that's something that two GM's have both emphasized, including Susan Polgar.  The idea being you want all your pieces, so moving the same thing more then once not only inhibits that, but it also waists time, as black will be able to complete her development.} Ba6 {?? However, @Erika: This is your first blunder, as white can win a piece here.  If this happens, he will have the advantage.  With that being said, how should your opponent proceed?} 8. b4 {Unfortunately, he did not.  @Erika: Best was 8.Bxa6, winning a piece at once.  But, with your next move, that opportunity is gone.  And, I'm sure that's why you played 8...b5 which is good, but it's important to be aware of how your opponent could've responded as that's part of being aware of threats made by your opponent which I mentioned after our training session.} b5 {! The threat was 9.b5 which Erika stops.  That move would've forked her Ba6 and Nc6.  Therefore, white would've won a piece for a pawn, after 9...Bxb5 (so that white wouldn't get a free piece), 10.Bxb5.} 9. Qb3 {?! And, white has waisted more time by bringing his Q into play before completing development.  Sometimes, you have to, when playing against things like the Scandinavian or Domino's Defenses.  But, in this case, white did not have a good reason for doing so, as better was 9.Be2, or 9.Bd3} Nd4 {?? Although this move looks good, it is a blunder, Erika.  As it turns out, he can win a piece for a pawn.  Can you figure out how?} 10. Qd1 {He missed it.  Best was 10.cxd4, and after 10...exd4, white is in better shape for the reason outlined above.  @Erika: So, what's important to remember is evaluating each position and studying them carefully.  Remember: What looks good might be a blunder, so it is very important to figure out what works or not and why.  } c5 {While the idea is to exchange, your Nd4 is still enprised (vulnerable), Erika, which gives him the opportunity to take.  Instead, much better was to get out of harms way by retreating.  Another important thing to mention, as we also discussed in our training is that, although it is minor, a piece is a piece, and therefore needs to be protecting.  In fact, protecting a pawn is also important, as my coach emphasizes.} 11. a4 {As noted before, instead of developing, white advances his a pawn, adding to Erika's advantage.} bxa4 {So, Erika takes.} 12. Ba3 {But, instead of taking back, white decides to develop here.  The only problem is that it's a little late, as he should've done it earlier.  Instead, preventing the loss of a pawn was more important, which is when we must deviate.  With that being said, best was 12.Qxa4.  But with this move, Erika can liquidate and take away the opportunity for white to complete development here, since the Bishop's will come off.} Bxf1 13. Rxf1 Nf3+ {?? I understand why you played this Erika.  You know that white has a weakness and thought it could be exploited.  But, the other idea was keeping it protected from his c3 pawn  If his Queen and Ng5 weren't defending this would be ideal.  But, the problem is that this is going to lose a piece for a pawn.  Best was 13...Nb3 gaining time in the process as his Ra1 is attacked.  It's important to that due to your a4, taking on b3?? would be an outright blunder.  The reason is that 14.Qxb3?? would result in 14...axb4  So, the only alternative would be 14.Ra2, and with his Knight blocked on Nb1, he can't bring it into play.  What that means is that you're advantages are increasing due to his lack in development and center control.  But, with this move, the initiative gets handed back to white since a piece is worth more then any of the other things.  As an example, this is why we deviate from General Openings, if it means preventing the loss of a piece.} 14. Qxf3 cxb4 15. cxb4 {Exchanging, and still staying ahead by the equivalent to two pawns.  But, best was to take the other way with 15.Bxb4, as now, black is forced to liquidate even further with 15...Bxb4, and now, 16.cxb4, or lose another pawn, which winds up being the equivalent to a piece.  So, with the variations and the reasoning, this would've been better a move later.} a5 {Going for another exchange.  } 16. d3 {? In doing so, not only does white get a pawn chain, but more importantly (since in this position, the concept is not important) he now has an outpost his Nb1.  In other words, he can develop it.  Best, however, was 16.bxa5, and after 16...Rxa5, black doesn't get anything back, yet.  By playing this, she will win back a pawn.} axb4 {That's because white cannot take back, due to Erika's DSB.  So, his next move is forced.  After this, Erika will gain more time by reattacking the Bishop.} 17. Bb2 a3 18. Bc1 {Forced, as anywhere else, and white would lose a piece.  In the process, Erika continues to gain tempo.  And, she will achieve an open file which is very useful.  That is especially because she has a passed pawn with a Rook behind, which as Jack Stockel and Susan Polgar emphasize, this is very useful. } a2 19. Nd2 {In the process, however,white develops his Knight.} Rb8 {? Trying to protect her b5 pawn. But, this is a mistake, Erika, believe it or not, as white can get rewin a pawn.  It's not easy to see but very possible, in this position.  Better was 19...Rc8 or 19...Qc8  I would've played 19...Qc8 to keep Ra8 behind the passed pawn on a2.} 20. Bb2 {Developing his bishop on the longest diagonal.  But, better was 20.Nxa2 (winning another pawn, at once.)  But, even better (best) was 20.Nc4, as now, you'd win two pawn by gaining, yet, another tempo.  So, 20.Nc4, Bc7 21.Rxa2, as a likely continuation would be 22...b3 (hitting his Rook), 23.Ra5 (winning your e5 pawn).  Now, you might attempt to refute this with 23...b2? in an attempt to promote, but this would be another mistake as white would answer with 24.Bxb2 winning another pawn, and after this, he would be ahead by the equivalent to a piece.  Though, I think that being 3 pawns down is worse then just a piece because we often use those pawns to promote.  } Bc5 {? I don't know why my student played this.  But, @Erika: This is a mistake because he can win another pawn.  Best was 20...Ra8} 21. Kd1 {And, white didn't find the move.  With that being said, best was still the immediate 21.Rxa2} b3 {This time, black protects a2, and in the process acheives a solid pawn chain which becomes important because they're both passers.} 22. Kc1 {But, white can still win a pawn.  Therefore, I'm not sure why he played this.  But, best was 22.Bxe5, and if 22...d6, he can get his Bc5 to safety.} Qa5 {?? Adding an extra defender to her a2. ?? But, this was a blunder.  What I mentioned about e5 is now void and invalid.  That's because white can now win a pawns and expose, Erika.  How should he proceed?  } 23. Qd1 {Putting pressure on the d1-a4 diagonal.  But, best was 23.Bxe5, and after, for example 23...Rb7, (to prevent 24.Nxb3, winning another pawn, and forking your Q+R which would force you to prevent the loss of a piece by waisting tempo), white answers with 24.Bxf6!, gxf6 25.Nf3 (leaving you with an exposed King.)  And, having your monarch exposed is often a way to lose which is why this is important to note.} Rbc8 {To minimize the damage, should white play 24.Nxb3.  And, to prevent the Rook from being attacked, if white takes with 24.Bxe5} 24. Ngf3 {Best was still to take on e5 because black now gets counterplay, with a nasty discovered check.} Be3+ 25. Qc2 {?? Best was 25.Bc3, to minimize the damage.  And, although black would still win a piece, white would gain tempo, in return.  However, Erika would still benefit, but with this move, however, black will win the Queen for free.  And, afterwards, she will liquidate, to add insult to injury.  Then, she will use a passed pawn to promote, and although white will take that promoted pawn, he will lose a Rook, in the process.  So, with best play, she has a forced win here.} Rxc2+ 26. Kd1 Rxb2 27. fxe3 Rxd2+ 28. Nxd2 b2 29. Ke2 bxa1=Q 30. Rxa1 d5 {I think the idea here is to get another passer.  But, his doubled pawns in the center will prevent.  So, although major pieces have been exchanged, in this particular position, doubled pawns are beneficial for white.  That's because it keeps him in longer.  And, with this move, white gains tempo.} 31. g5 dxe4 {?? Still trying to get a passed pawn and promote.  But, @Erika: this is a blunder because white will get a Knight and pawn, in return.  Instead, you had to retreat.  And, now I'm here to teach you something very important, which I use Joe's (tactical-abyss's method).  Just because you've won the Queen, doesn't mean that you're out of the woods, yet.  You still need to be careful and not become overly confident.  Thinking that you're now going to win, no matter what, is a way to go wrong.  In fact, my coach taught me that, while annotating a game.  Plus, there was a different game that I annotated.  The game was played before becoming a 900 rated player (actually having one of my lowest ratings.)  Now, I started off with a Queen, Knight, Two pawns up.  Later on, I blundered my Queen.  But, with a near won game, I thought that what I did didn't matter because I was going to win.  Well, that attitude led to my downfall because she didn't just win back material, but this opponent was able to promote, and once she did, I lost what I had left over.  This forced me into resignation.  And, Joe gives examples, more similar to this, in his Q sacs.  That's because he sacrifices his Queen early, and due to over confidence, he still wins.} 32. gxf6 gxf6 33. Nxe4 Qc5 {?? And, this was also a blunder as black will win back your Queen, Erika.  I'm not sure what your best move, but just about, anything was better then this.  In doing so, you have thrown your win.  Doesn't mean that you're not going to win, but you will have to work much harder, whereas, before it was an easy win.  And, this is another reason why it's not good to become overly confident.  In doing so, you have underestimated your opponent.  With that here's something else that my coach said, when annotating the game.  That is, the moral.  "When you think that you have won or are in a winning position, be very careful, and do not underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise, you might start making mistakes and losing the game."  Although black is not lost, this applies here.} 34. Nxc5 Rc8 {Going right after his Knight.} 35. Rc1 {So, white protects.} a1=Q {Black thinks that she has gotten a Queen.  But, what Erika overlooked is white's next move.  However, black will be the equivalent by taking with the N.  And, while it appears drawish, black does have a winning advantage.  However, it's not easy, and she must play accurately to keep it.} 36. Rxa1 Rxc5 37. Rg1+ {I presume that white checked to get a draw.  I think that he was calculating a draw by repetition, but forgot that with her next move, as with any other way to get out of check, the position cannot repeat itself.} Kf8 38. h4 {There is nothing wrong with this move.  But, I would've played 38.Rf6 (putting pressure on f6).  And, as it's good practice, let's reverse so that I'd be white.  So, if Rf6 were played, as black, I'd respond with 38...Kg7, and from there we have a standard endgame.  I approached something like this in one or two games, but I learned it, as a similar position occurred in my favorite annotation of all time with more variations then any other that I've studied.  And, a position like this was reached, and one of the variations also led to something similar to what I just mentioned, where the Rook goes after the pawn, and the opponent defends with his or her monarch.  This is also important because it proves just how powerful your King is, in the endgame.} h5 {Erika thought that white had a passed pawn and was, therefore, going to stop it.  Best, however, was 38...Rc2+, 39.Ke1, Rc1+, 40.Kf2, and now, 40...Rc2+ leads to a draw by repetition.  But, I think that black has something better which would win.  Such as 38...Rc2+, 39.Ke1, Ke7, and if we keep using the King, the distant opposition (I believe) would be of a concern, as now we have a dangerous fortress with black's monarch.  And, I believe that we can use that fortress to get an eventual pawn chain, which would guarantee a promotion.  Once again, it's not a fact, but I believe that this would happen.  And, I'm doing some very difficult Homework by trying to think long term plans without analyze the board since visualization has also helped me to improve.} 39. Rg2 {I have no idea why white played, but better was 39.Kf3, as the monarch is now doing a lot of damage because it allows 40.Ke4 Yes, the position is now very similar to ...Re1 being the solution which would force a draw (as mentioned.)  But, this time, it would be the best case, I think that white would win.  A possible continuation would be after that would be, 40...Ra5 41.d4, exd4 42.exd4, Rd5 43.Ke4, Rd7 44.d5, Ke7 45.Kd4, Rd6 46.Kc5, Rd7 47.d6+, Ke6 48.Re1+, Kf5 49.Re7, Rxe7 50.dxe7, as now, white would Queen.  } Rc2+ {But, Erika now goes for it with the move that I mentioned earlier.} 40. Kf1 {Protecting his Rook.} Rxg2 {! So, black decides to exchange.  In fact, this was a good idea, Erika, because you're up a pawn.  And, when you're ahead, liquidating pieces is to your benefit, as noted earlier.} 41. Kxg2 e4 {? I presume that you were thinking about promoting, Erika.  But, what you have to keep in mind is that this isn't a passed pawn.  If it were, the move would work, but the pawn right next to it stops it.  And, with that, white equalizes.  So, you have to ask how your opponent will respond and that is also very important.  Better was 41...f5, followed by 42...e4 with a very solid pawn.  And, now when he takes on e4, you're still a pawn up.} 42. dxe4 f5 {This is another mistake, Erika.  And, with that white should have an advantage.  With that being said, what is his best move and why?} 43. e5 {I presume that white thought that this was a passer, except that he overlooked black's f7 pawn.  With that being said, best was the immediate 43.exf5, and although not easy, white should win.} f6 {? Now, I understand.  You were trying to undouble your pawns.  But, in this position, your doubled pawns are of no asset, and with this move he can still get a pawn and wind up ahead.  In fact, although not easy to say, from there he should win.} 44. e6 {So, best was 44.exf6!} Ke7 {Stopping white's pawn from doing any more damage.} 45. Kf3 {I think the long term plan is white getting the opposition.  The problem is that with Erika's doubled pawns, it won't work.} f4 {The idea is exchanging pawns, but it works here.} 46. exf4 f5 {Blocking his f4.} 47. Kg3 Kxe6 48. Kg2 {At this point, there are not a lot of playable moves for white.  So, one move is as good or bad as the other.  No matter how you look at it, though, white can no longer win.} Kd5 49. Kf3 Kd4 50. Kf2 {At this point, a draw a was agreed on.  But, as ION pointed out, black could have won this game.  In it, he said, "Erika, with the Black pieces agreed a draw at this point (I presume she accepted a draw offer). But, she had an easy win from here, as White was in a zugzwang, and had to give ground. Black could have cleaned up:   50...Ke4  51.Kg3 Ke3  52.Kg2 Kxf4 - Which simply could not maintain protection of the f-pawn, nor the h-pawn, if Black so wills it   53.Kh3 Kf3  54.Kh2 f4! - Black also wins by ...Kg4 and ...Kxh4, but I prefer this pawn advance  55.Kh3 f3!  56.Kh2 Ke3 - Also winning are ...Ke2 and ...Kf1. I prefer to move the K to the e-file [a] to leave the queening square f1 open, and [b] to keep the WK stuck in the corner.   57.Kg1 Ke2 - Not 57...f2ch?? as White can force a draw by 58.Kf1! Kf4 (...Kf3 is Stalemate!) 59.Kxf2 Kg4 60.Kg2 Kxh4 61.Kh2 ... after which the WK never moves off the 4 corner squares and Black can't force the h-pawn through.   58.Kh2 f2 - Black has made sure the WK never got in front of the f-pawn.  59.Kg3 f1=Q  60.Kh2 Qf4ch - Black has to ensure that the WK alsways has a move available. So  60...Kf2 or ...Kf3 would have thrown away the win (Stalemate)   61.Kg2 Qg4ch  62.Kh2 Kf2 - Now is the time, When White has one move available.  63.Kh1 ... Black can choose from three different checkmates."  So, the moral is not to just offer or accept a draw offer.  Instead, you must play the draw out first.  For example, in a different game against Jack Stockel (which I didn't restart annotating those games, at the time,) although it was even (material wise), my coach had a win.  However, I thought noone could win, so I offered him a draw.  But, Jack declined by saying, "You're offering me a draw?  I don't have to give you a draw."   And, later he was able to force a win, and said that you have to play out the draw first.   @Erika: As archduke_piccolo also told me, remembering this moral will also help you to improve your, overall, games.  }
