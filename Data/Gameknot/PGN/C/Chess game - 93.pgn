[Opening "Sicilian (B23), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {Here, I wanted to play Nc3 first. I had f4 in mind but wanted to delay it. } Nc6 3. f4 e6 4. Nf3 d5 {Here, I could exchange on d5 first and then play Bb5 having e4 square for my Knight after d4 but i wanted center to be closed and didnt see any problem about Ne2. Thus I played the next move 5-Bb5 } 5. Bb5 d4 {i would love it if my opponent exchanged on e4, but as i said earlier, i expected this and it was ok.} 6. Ne2 Bd7 7. O-O a6 {My Bishop is there to exchange the Knight for a Bishop. I waited till this move in order not to lose a tempo.} 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 9. d3 Nf6 10. Qe1 {Ne5 would be even better. But Qe1 is also a good move, I am aiming for g3 or h4 square for my Queen.} Be7 11. Ne5 {Now Ne4 is a good move it is hard to get rid of Knight from that square and it is like an octopus there.} Qc7 {Obviously my opponent did not want me to ruin his pawn structure after the exchange on c6.} 12. Nxc6 {A very bad move. Just as I said earlier Knight was too strong and the Bishop was not as effective cause of my e4 pawn. I thought I could play h3 followed by e5 and kick the Knight to bad position and later use e4 my other Knight. the problem is that I did not think the fact that when i play e5 I leave the d5 square for his knight. Thus i regretted this move already in a second.} Qxc6 13. h3 h5 {My opponent does not want to allow me to play g4 but it was not my thought. Apart from that this move weakens his kingside.  But still, his king is in the center and can go both sides. } 14. c3 {I played this move to open up the c file. In case his king decides to go queenside, this might be a problem. } Rd8 {Here I think my opponent did an inaccuracy. I could simply exchange on d4 and maybe later play  b3 and somehow Bb2 followed by Rc1. That would be devastating. Bishop would be too strong on diagonal and Rook on c1 would be extremely well placed. But i didnt bother thinking about that strategy, it is the bad side of playing 5 min chess on the net. So i followed the previous strategy: play c4 followed by e5, then his knight has no good squares and my knight has e4. } 15. c4 b5 16. b3 b4 17. e5 Nd7 {Here I paused a bit, realizing my previous plan does not work that easy. in case of Ng3 he would play f5 and e4 would be mere a dream for me and the position is very unclear. So i played Qg3 somehow forcing my opponent to play g6 and weakening dark squares there...} 18. Qg3 g6 {this weakens dark squares.} 19. Kh2 {I wanted to play my Knight g1,f3,g5 and e4 if i can so i moved my king out. Kh1 would be a better choice, i could not decide in the game.} a5 20. Ng1 Nb6 {My opponent obviously wants exchanges on a4. } 21. Nf3 a4 22. Ng5 O-O {Here my opponent, realized the danger and castled kingside which is even more dangerious.} 23. Ne4 {I achieved my aim in the end. My opponent cannot play f6 or f5 cause of my queen on g3, threatening Qxg6+.} Kg7 {Now he can play f5 but it is white to play.} 24. f5 { 24 - f5. I dont allow him to play f5. besides that this move opens the diagonal for Bishop on c1. whites attack is already too strong.} exf5 25. Rxf5 h4 {Here Qf4 would finish the game. Cause after gxf5 white has Nf6 followed by Qh6 black cannot avoid mate. I played an automatic move despite having around 1 hour on the clock.} 26. Qg4 Qe6 {Still, white has a strong attack after Bh6+ followed by Qf4. In this moment i saw the previous move would finish the game and i regretted it. Here I calculated Bh6 but had a funny lil mistake on calculation and played a bad move.} 27. Rf3 Qxg4 28. hxg4 Nd7 29. Bf4 Rda8 30. Rb1 {another bad (passive) move...} axb3 31. axb3 Ra6 32. Nd2 {and last bad move. which loses after g5} g5 {0-1   I tried hard but paid the bill caused by playing extremely fast. This was a good lesson for me. Hope I will learn to play in a tournament.}
