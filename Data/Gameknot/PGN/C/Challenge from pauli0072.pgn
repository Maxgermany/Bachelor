Nh5 {white is working on exposing black's left side} Nxh5 10. Qxh5 Ne7 {bringing over more help} 11. Bg5 {worth a try......} g6 {nope - it didn't work - now he's gotta go with bishop to e7} 12. Bxe7 {decided against the sacrifice - too early in the game, also if queen sacrifice black opens up column g for possible white attack and will have to kill white bishop with either king or black rook this will eliminate queens castle opportunity later on} Qxe7 13.
