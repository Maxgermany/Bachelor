[Opening "French (C00), Pelikan variation"]

1. e4 {I prefer facing e4 to d4.  I have never studied the Siciliian lines; I sometimes play the Caro Cann, but my favorite response is the French defense.} e6 2. Nc3 {I think this move is probably good, since black in this position wants to play d5.} d5 3. exd5 exd5 {After this simplification, the position appears equal and white has many possible continuations to consider.} 4. d4 {The board begins to take on the characteristics of a closed game.} Bb4 {I am pretty sure this is OK, but maybe just c6 would've been more solid.} 5. Bd2 {I think this move is a bit passive for white, although it is obviously OK.} c6 {I think c6 in this position is better than c5, because of nxc6, but maybe there was something else good.} 6. Qe2+ {I don't like this move for white, but maybe the idea is to prepare O-O-O.} Be6 {I think this is better than ne7.} 7. a3 {A normal move, but maybe bd6 or be7, and black is now better.} Bd6 8. Nf3 Nd7 9. Ng5 {This move looked threatening at first, because of the weakness on e6.  But I think the attack can be parried, and here I prepare to do so.} Qf6 {I think qe7 is also playable, and could have been better, or maybe you are able to see something better here.} 10. Nxe6 fxe6 {Although the weakness on e6 persists, I think black is getting a very comfortable position.  White's d-pawn is obviously going to be under fire, and his bishop on f1 is blocked from natural development by the queen.  Maybe f4 would have inhibited e5, and white has to be concerned about f4.  White's priority might be to inhibit e5.  But first, of course, white has to prop up d4.} 11. Qh5+ {I think this may be a blunder.} g6 12. Qh3 {Here d4 is immune because of qe6+.  E5 may be a possible continuation for black.} O-O-O 13. O-O-O {I thought the black position was comely and very playable.  A glance at the position reveals that white has the bishop pair, which could be considered an advantage.  On the other hand, I have an idea about keeping the board closed, winning f2 (which at present can't be played because of qxe6), getting knights on e4 and c4, and playing e5.} Ne7 14. Be2 Nf5 {Threatening nxd4.} 15. Be3 e5 16. Bg4 {This move seems to introduce some tactics, and black could end up with an isolated f-pawn.} e4 {I just pushed e4 because I thought I can still win d4, and my pawns in the center will be decisive.} 17. Ne2 {Looking to play ng3 and get a third piece attacking my knight.  Also possible for white would be nf4, looking to trade off my bishop.} Qg7 {Inviting an exchange of f5 that will leave white up a pawn.  I had seen this and thought black would get good counterplay after qxf5.} 18. Bxf5 gxf5 19. Nf4 {But he avoids qf5.  White seems to have a strong knight here on f4.} Bxf4 {I decide the knight was too strong and must go.  The loss of my bishop could be telling, since the black squares around my king are weak.} 20. Bxf4 Qf6 {Just protecting the f5 pawn.  My d7 knight isn't very good at all, but I have a strong pawn presence in the center.  I would be interested to know how you assess this position for black.} 21. Qb3 {Maybe there are ideas of qa4, but I think black is pretty solid on the queenside.} Nb6 {I finally try to get my knight into the action.} 22. h4 Nc4 {This move appears to be a blunder because black is losing the exchange.} 23. Bg5 Qd6 {But there is still a lot of play in the position after bd8 and rd8.  Maybe black can make use of the g file with rg8.} 24. Bxd8 Rxd8 25. Qh3 {And white is back to pressuring f5.  Being up material, white can hope to exchange pieces off and cruise to a winning endgame.  Black needs to quickly develop some threats to avoid being ground down.} Qf4+ {Defending f4 and threatening qxf2.} 26. Kb1 Rg8 {I didn't go in for the pawn because I would have lost f5 after rf1.} 27. g3 Qxf2 {But here I play it because I have pressure on g3.} 28. Rhf1 Rxg3 {And I equalize in material and threaten to take h4 if rxf5.} 29. Qxf5+ Qxf5 30. Rxf5 {In this position I have a pawn for the exchange, but the situation looks pretty bad for black.} Rh3 31. Rh5 {Time began to get low on my clock and I struggled to find a good move here.  } b5 {Please tell me if you think there is a better move in this critical position.} 32. Rxh7 e3 {I biked the e3 pawn because time was running low for both players and I wanted to create complications for white.  Here I intend to tie his d1 rook down.} 33. Re1 Nd6 {Nf4 would be strong because it threatens d4 and h4.} 34. h5 {White has his own passed pawn he looks to promote.} Nf5 {I play nf5 anyway, threatening d4 and guarding the h6 square.} 35. h6 {White plays h6 because if black accepts the sacrifice his knight will be pinned.} Nxh6 {I took it anyway.  Please let me know if you see anything better here.} 36. Rh8+ Kd7 37. Kc1 {He wants to activate his king, but the board is not yet settled and black's king could prove exposed.} Ke7 {I am sure there are stronger moves here, but I wanted to centralize the king and drive the h8 rook off the h file.} 38. Rg1 {Though it threatens the menacing rg7+, this move allows me to inch my pawn down the board.} e2 39. Kd2 Rh2 {Black's only defense.  It is looking like black's best hope to win - the e2 pawn - may be mopped up after re1.} 40. Ke1 {Where re1 was clearly superior and probably winning.  It was a blitz game and time was short, and here white makes a crucial mistake.} Kf7 {With the knight still pinned, I don't see anything more concrete.} 41. Rh7+ Kf6 42. Rxa7 {A materialistic move from white lets black stir up an attack.} Nf5 43. Ra6 {The knight covers the g7 square, where white could have doubled rooks.} Nxd4 {Black is now coming in for the attack.  Defending c6 and threatening Nf3#.} 44. c3 {And he allows me to finish off the game with a nice knight's move, and the e2 pawn, though never promoted, playing an important part in the mate.} Nf3# {}
