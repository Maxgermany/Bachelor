[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. Bd3 {White strives for a classic Stonewall formation.} Nc6 4. f4 {prevents e7-e5 and a prop for an eventual N at e5.} Bg4 {Black doesn't want to be saddled with a "bad bishop."} 5. Nf3 {The pin is temporary.} e6 6. Nbd2 Bd6 {The Bishop is in a bad spot, biting on granite.} 7. c3 {Prevents Nb4 and establishes the Stonewall pawn formation on the black squares.} O-O 8. O-O Bf5 {Black has wasted a move.  White doesn't want to provide double pawn support for Black's Knight at e4, therefore no exchange.} 9. Bc2 a6 {Black wastes another move.} 10. Ne5 {This is the natural home of the King Knight.  Black can't play NxN because of the pawn fork.  White also plans an eventual pawn push e3-34 after suitable preparation.} Ne7 11. h3 {White may have been seeing ghosts, but an aggressive Kside attack is normal fare for the Stonewall, with g2-g4 often spearheading the attack.  h3 gives this idea some support.} c5 {Black's move is frequently seen but comes late in this variation.} 12. g4 Bxc2 13. Qxc2 {White has an easy game.  A lot of firepower directed at the black King, and the White King, although exposed, is safe.} Qc7 14. Ndf3 {White wants to keep a Knight on e5.} Rac8 15. Ng5 {White seeks to provoke a pawn move, thus weakening Black's fortress.  It costs him two tempi.  } h6 16. Ngf3 {Mission accomplished.} b6 {Black's attack is irrelevant and too slow.} 17. Bd2 Ne4 18. Be1 f6 {White's passivity has given Black counterplay.} 19. Nd3 c4 20. Nc1 {White plans to reposition the Knight onto the Kside.} f5 21. Ne2 g5 22. Ne5 fxg4 23. hxg4 Bxe5 24. dxe5 Nc6 25. Kg2 {provides additional defense to g3 and allows access to the h-file by the Rook.} Qg7 26. Ng3 {and the game was timed out.  This was a bad game to annotate, as the result was really unresolved.}
