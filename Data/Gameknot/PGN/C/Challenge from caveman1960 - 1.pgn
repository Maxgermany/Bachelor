1. e4 {berettastorm opens with 1.e4 looking for an open attacking game which suits his style. He had black under pressure right up to the unfortunate blunder on move 25.} c6 {black chooses the Caro Kann looking for a game that is solid which suits his style more than a counter attacking Sicilian.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {Developing a piece and looking for active play.This probably suits berettastorm more than 3.e5.} dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 {A safe developing move.Next time I would nt be surprised to see berrettastorm choose the more aggressive 5.Bc4 or 5.Ng5} Ngf6 6. Ng3 {Retaining pieces for the attack and a more principled mnove than 6.Nxf6} e6 7. Bc4 {7.Bd3 is more popular but there is nothing wrong with the move played and it puts us on our own resources much earlier.} Qc7 {Preventing Bf4 and supporting the push c5.} 8. Qe2 {White in this game always looks to put his pieces in attacking positions.} Nb6 9. Bb3 {9.Bd3 is another possibility and a game for another day.} c5 {A thematic move by black as at some time he needs to counter attack from his solid but passive position, the tricl is to time it right. To early and black will get blown away. Too late and black will be suffocated.} 10. c3 {10.dxc is a sound alternative.} cxd4 11. Nxd4 {11.cxd taking on an isolated Q pawn with attacking possibilities is also playable.} Be7 12. O-O O-O 13. Bg5 {Develoing and bringing another piece into an attacking position, though the silican monster likes 13. Re1 at this stage.} Bd7 14. Rfe1 Rfe8 15. Kh1 {I would like berrettastorms comment on this move. I think he perhaps planned f4 at some stage and wanted the K off the a7/g1 diagonal in case of a pin on c5 by black.I think it was a tempo loss and our silicon friend agrees, assessing the position as 0.00 dead equal.It suggests Bxf6 though I was more concerned about Nb5.} Nfd5 {Played to exchange off some attacking pieces  though the silicon monster(SM) suggests I should have played the other N there.} 16. Bxe7 Rxe7 17. Qg4 {As always berrettastorm looks to attack though 17.Rad1 may have been better.} Nf6 18. Qg5 h6 19. Qh4 Rae8 20. Nh5 {White played this to remove a crucial K-side defender.} Nxh5 {Black happily excnages an attacking piece.} 21. Qxh5 Ba4 {Black continues his policy off seeking exchanges.21.....e5 was an alternative but black felt the White B was more dangerous than the N.} 22. Re3 {White continues to move his pieces to attacking positions eyeing Rg3 and blacks K.} Bxb3 23. axb3 Nd5 {Bringing the cavalry to the K-side defence.} 24. Rg3 a6 {The two candidate moves I looked at. Nf6 and a6 the move played.I was tempted by Nf6 as I thought it might induce the Qxh6 blunder.In the end I played a6 as it prevents Nb5 and protects the a pawn and closes whites play down the a file for the moment.} 25. Qxh6 {And white unfortunately takes the poisoned pawn overlooking the intermezzo QxR. The SM likes 25.b4 I prefer 25.Re1 and either move leaves white in it with a balanced game and some attacking chances. Long term the p structure may favour black but there is still a lot of play in the position. My hat of to berrettastorm up to move 25 he had me sweating bricks.} Qxg3 26. hxg3 {}
