1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 {The queens gambit accepted.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bg4 {Not a common move, 4...e6 is the main move.} 5. Bxc4 e6 6. h3 Bh5 7. Nc3 c6 {A loss of time as black may not be able to play e6-e5 now.} 8. O-O Nbd7 9. Qe2 Bd6 10. Rd1 O-O 11. e4 Bb4 {Bad, e5 is the only good move.} 12. a3 Bxc3 {This third move of the bishop only makes white's centre stronger.} 13. bxc3 b5 14. Bd3 Nb6 15. g4 Bg6 16. Bg5 {With a simple idea, P-e5 winning a piece.} h6 {This does not have to be played as it weakens the king side.} 17. Bh4 Qc7 18. Ne5 Nbd7 {P-a6 with the idea of c6-c5 or B-h7 are plans that need to be looked at.} 19. Nxg6 fxg6 20. a4 {Opening lines and giving black a weak queenside before attacking the king.} g5 {A terrible move as it weakens the b1-h7 diagonal an puts the bishop on the lovely h2-b8 diagonal. P-a6 is a good move.} 21. Bg3 Qa5 {Black is now lost as he will get his queen kicked around and his king will get into danger.} 22. axb5 Qxc3 23. Rac1 Qxd4 24. bxc6 Nb6 25. e5 Kh8 26. Bb1 Qb4 27. exf6 gxf6 {Rxf6 may have prolonged the final outcome.} 28. Bd6 Qb3 29. Bxf8 Rxf8 30.
