1. e4 {I'm curious here. Was black's (ultimately winning) reply on move 22 really sound? - It worked out well for me but looks risky.} c5 2. Bc4 {As a regular Sicilian player, I see this a lot, even from players rated a little higher than me. It does not scare me. It used to, when I first started playing the Sicilian as white immediately threatens f7 but...} e6 {...black can achieve equality very easily.} 3. a3 {Not sure if I understand the point of this move. Fear of a queen's knight advance via c8 to b4?} Nc6 4. Nf3 g6 5. d3 Bg7 6. c3 {This move is intended to relieve the pressure on b2? - white has restricted the space that his knight can develop into and does not seem to have gained very much for it.} Nge7 7. Be3 {Threatens the pawn on c5 and develops the bishop.} b6 8. Ba2 {I'm not sure what this gains for white... seems to relinquish the c4 to a6 diagonal, lose a tempi and gain nothing.} O-O {Obvious castle is obvious.} 9. O-O {Ditto. Black would seem to have the advantage here, in my opinion.} Ne5 {Begins to threaten at white's defences - too early? - black maybe should have developed its white bishop to b7 before attempting this?} 10. Nxe5 Bxe5 {A straight exchange... but weakens white's defences for his castled king.} 11. Bh6 {Further weakens the defences around the white's king - in the hope of a blunder from black?} Re8 {Obvious move is obvious.} 12. f4 {White doesn't seem to have much to threaten with yet... maybe should have found a way to develop the knight before mounting this attack?} Bg7 {Offers the exchange.} 13. Bxg7 {Exchange taken... the white king's position is again, just a little weaker.} Kxg7 14. Nd2 {Maybe white has control of the centre but black seems to have an equal claim. I still think black has the advantage... weirdly, I didn't feel so confident here when playing the game as when I look at this position now.} Bb7 {15 .., d5 can strike at white's centre} 15. Nc4 {Hmm, black replying with d5 not considered by white?} d5 16. exd5 exd5 17. Ne5 Nf5 18. Qe2 {White pins his own knight? - Gambling that it will be easy to get out of this position.} d4 {Black continues to pick away at white's pawns.} 19. Bxf7 {Seems to counter the pin?} Re7 {Maybe not so much.} 20. Bc4 {Another tempi wasted?} Ne3 {Black's knight gets deep into white's territory and threatens a rook. } 21. Rf2 Qf8 {This move prepares for black's reply on move 22.} 22. Rc1 Nxg2 {This move. It proved to win the game with a knight sacrifice but also seems inherently risky. My thinking was that the rook would take the knight on g2, leaving the pawn on f4 undefended. Planning 23. Rxh2, Qxf4 and then both of white's rooks are directly threatened and Rxe5 is possible attacking white's queen.  But is this really sound?} 23. Rxg2 Qxf4 {All goes in line with black's plan.} 24. cxd4 {Protects the knight but loses the rook on c1. I think this is a blunder.} Qxc1+ 25. Kf2 {White's king is opened up to attacks from black.} Rf8+ {White looks very exposed now.} 26. Kg3 Bxg2 27. Kxg2 cxd4 {White's knight is still pinned to the queen and now has no pawns to defend it.} 28. a4 {Not sure if I can know what this was meant to achieve.} Qg5+ {Attacks the king and the knight.} 29. Kh1 Rxe5 {Poor knight. White's queen threatened.} 30. Qd1 {White cannot really go on the attack any more, as the queen is all that can really stay back to defend the king.} Rf2 {Threatens mate by Qg2#} 31. Qg1 {Defends the mate but...} Re1 {Queen is now pinned to the king. If she takes the rook on e1, then black wins with the Qg2 mate, if she does not move then Qxg1 also wins for black.} 32. Qxe1 Qg2# {Game over. Black wins... }
