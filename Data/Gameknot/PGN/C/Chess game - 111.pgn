1. Nf3 {My favorite opening for all my games} d5 {He moves his pawn out} 2. d4 {I move my pawn out} Bg4 {He moves his bishop to threaten my knight} 3. Nc3 {I move my knight out} e6 {Protecting his pawn} 4. e4 {Threatening his pawn} Bb4 {Moving his bishop to threaten my knight} 5. exd5 {Taking his pawn} Qxd5 {He takes my pawn} 6. Bd2 {Moving my bishop to protect my knight} Bxc3 {Taking my knight} 7. Bxc3 {Taking his bishop} Bxf3 {He takes my knight} 8. gxf3 {I take his bishop} Nf6 {Moving his knight out} 9. Bd3 {Moving my bishop out} Nc6 {Moving his other knight out} 10. O-O {I castle} Nxd4 {He takes my pawn} 11. Bxd4 {I take his knight} Qxd4 {He takes my bishop. } 12. Bb5+ {I put him in check; now he has technically lost his queen because he has to move to protect his king. He could always move the queen back to protect it, but he'll lose it anyway. } c6 {Protecting his king} 13. Qxd4 {I take his queen! Now he will probably take my bishop, but no biggie. } cxb5 {He takes my bishop, as expected.} 14. Qd1 {I move my queen back because at this point, I don't know what to do next. } Rd8 {He threatens my queen} 15. Qe1 {Moving my queen out of the way} O-O {He castles} 16. Qa5 {Threatening his unprotected pawns} a6 {Protecting both pawns at once} 17. Qc7 {Threatening his other pawn} Rd7 {Threatening my queen (again).} 18. Qc3 {Moving my queen out of danger} Nd5 {Threatening my queen (again).} 19. Qd3 {Moving my queen out of danger} Rfd8 {Moving his other rook into the fray} 20. Qe2 {I still don't know what to do, but I figure that his next move will be to move his knight so his rook threatens my queen.} Nf4 {Threatening my queen} 21. Qe4 {Moving my queen out of danger and threatening his knight} Rd7d4 {Threatening my queen and protecting his knight} 22. Qxb7 {Taking his unprotected pawn} Rd4d2 {Threatening my row of pawns} 23. Qxa6 {Taking his pawn. Now that I think about it, it would have been better to do Qc7 to protect my pawn; if he tried to take my pawn, I could do Qxd8#.} Nh3+ {He puts me in check.} 24. Kg2 {Moving my king out of check} Nf4+ {Putting me in check (again).} 25. Kg3 {Moving my king out of check} Ne2+ {Putting me in check again!} 26. Kg2 {Moving out of check again} Nf4+ {Putting me in check again} 27. Kg3 {Moving out of check again} Ne2+ {Putting me in check again} 28. Kh3 {Moving out of check again} Nf4+ {Putting me in check again} 29. Kg4 {Foiling his check} Rd2d4 {Moving his rook to threaten another check} 30. Qxb5 {Taking his unprotected pawn} Rd8d5 {Threatening my queen} 31. Rfd1 {This was probably not the smartest move. Instead, I should have done Qe8#.} Ne2+ {He puts me in check again} 32. Rxd4 {I take his rook (therefore getting out of check). He resigned after this move. I think eventually I would have figured out the Qe8# after a while.}
