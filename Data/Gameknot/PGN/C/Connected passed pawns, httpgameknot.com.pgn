1. d4 {I play white in this blitz game.  Normal queen's gambit opening for a while.} d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. a3 {I don't know why I chose this move order.  There's probably something wrong with this move.  However, the queen's gambit seems to be a bit forgiving to a beginner like me.} e6 4. Nc3 c6 5. Bg5 {Where does this bishop go, here or f4?  I tried this one.} Be7 6. e3 O-O 7. Nf3 a6 {Not sure what this does.  b5 is already unavailable to the N.  I suppose it prepares b5 pawn push.} 8. Ne5 {This move goes in the "try" category.} b5 {There's the push.} 9. b3 {Required.} Bb7 10. Be2 Nbd7 {Kicks my N.} 11. Nxd7 Qxd7 12. O-O h6 13. Bh4 Nh7 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. cxb5 {My normal conundrum--how to handle pawns???  Help?} axb5 16. b4 {?? the a pawn is backward, my B is still junk.  (So is black's, though...)} e5 17. Re1 f5 {Black charges ahead.  I search for counterplay.} 18. dxe5 Qxe5 {Threatens the N, which has very few squares, threatens some sort of infiltration.} 19. Qc1 {Several options to protect the N, I went with the one that doubled up on a3.  I probably should have kept the Q aimed at a4, however.  Ahh, blitz.} Ng5 20. a4 {Looking for counterplay on the Queen side.  This threatens to win a pawn, actually, and I'm not sure black's best response.  Perhaps bxa4, followed by a rook trade, is best.  This does allow white a good knight on c5, however.  But black opted for...} Ne4 {Easily dealt with, allowing me to trade a weak knight for a strong one.} 21. Nxe4 fxe4 22. axb5 {The pawn is won, if I'm not mistaken.} Rxa1 23. Qxa1 Qf5 {Black tries to keep up the attack, but plays a dangerous game with the a and b files.} 24. Rf1 Ra8 25. Qb2 {c1 was an interesting try, doubling the attack on c6; but I wanted to avoid a rook inflitration.} h5 {Black tries to keep the attack going, but his plan is too slow.} 26. Rc1 {Threatening bxc6 with a winning advantage.} h4 {?  Black lacks an immediate threat, and is allowing connected passed pawns.} 27. bxc6 {! obvious, and deadly.  Black lacks an adequate reply.} Bc8 28. b5 {Passed pawns must be pushed!} g5 {Too slow.} 29. b6 {Threatening b7 and the fork.} Rb8 30. b7 {Push!} Be6 31. c7 {And push!} Rxb7 {Off comes the rook.} 32. Qxb7 h3 33. g3 Bc8 {A try, but walks into a pin.} 34. Qb8 Kg7 {Breaks the pin} 35. Ba6 {Perhaps maneuvering the rook to the 8th rank was a better plan, but Black is lost.} Bxa6 36. c8=Q Qf3 {Black goes all in, hoping for a slip.  I had about 1:00 left on the clock, but apparently that wasn't enough for me to find a forced mate with two queens and a rook on the stranded king.  Oh well.  Back to the tactical training for me.} 37. Qcg8+ {?  Qh8, denying the retreat down the h file, was needed, followed by a Qb8 to c7 or d6.} Kh6 38. Rc6+ {?? Arg. Qh8!} Kh5 39. Qh7+ {I guess, but..} Kg4 40. Qf4+ {? This worked, but it's a crude tool it seems.} gxf4 41. Qg6# {Finally.  The passed pawns prevail.}
