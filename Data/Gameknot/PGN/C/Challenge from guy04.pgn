1. e4 {Coaching game ; this annotation is for the benefit of rebelsnake. But I hope it can benefit others too.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {An unusual reply to the Spanish opening. Quite playable.  Attacks the e4 pawn.} 4. O-O {Not worrying about that pawn. Nxp would be followed by Re1 and white regains the pawn with the initiative.} d6 {Protects the e5 pawn and might threaten to take at e4. But the knight at c6 is pinned.} 5. d4 {Naturally. Since white is ahead in terms of king safety, he must try action in the center and open up the play.} Bd7 {A good move, unpinning the knight. But Be7 was possible (d5 being met with a6 - white wins a pawn but it may be difficult to protect).} 6. Re1 a6 {Finally black plays this, the natural move (at move 3).} 7. Bxc6 {White goes for the simple plan of winning a pawn.} Bxc6 8. dxe5 Nxe4 {A dangerous decision. pxp was much safer.} 9. exd6 {Because now the black knight is pinned.} Bxd6 {Excellent. Black is now closer to being able to castle and the black bishops are very well placed. Black has managed the opening rather well, except for this pinned knight.} 10. Nc3 {A mistake that turns out right. But first consider the (bad) alternative :      10 Ng5 to take advantage of the pinned knight and capture it. After black plays pawn to f5, if now white plays f3 which seems to win the knight, black has Bc5  (Kh1 is answered by QxQ...RxQ...Nf2 and black wins, while Kf1 is answered by Bb5 ).     But the best move was probably 10 Qd4. I underestimated the best reply white could have made...} Qe7 {...which was Bb4, as my opponent pointed out. But he made the wrong choice.} 11. Nxe4 {Now after black recaptures, we have the same manoeuvre as before, but this time white will be able to capture the Bishop at e4 without any complications.} O-O-O {Here black seems to have lost the thread of the game. He should have recaptured the knight.  After all, a piece is a piece. But, there is a trap involved here. White must be careful.} 12. Nxd6+ {On a careless move such as b3 for instance, black would have played Bh2  and won the white Queen!} Qxd6 {Here black could have tried RxB. It would be easy for white to go wrong with RxQ (followed by RxQ  for black and if Re1 black plays BxN! with a dead draw in perspective (an ending with bishops of opposite colors is very difficult to win).} 13. Qxd6 {Not taking any chances. When you're ahead in material, exchange pieces and you'll wind up with an easy win. Of course, one must be confident on his ability to win a won game in the ending.} Rxd6 14. Bf4 {White must still follow the right track. This is the natural move as it attacks the rook while developing the bishop (and freeing the rook at a1).} Rdd8 {Rd7 was better : Protecting the second rank (the natural place for white's rooks) while preparing for a possible doubling of black's rooks on the d file.} 15. Re7 {The only move of the game requiring no thinking at all. A rook on the 7th rank is the paradise of the chess player.} Bd7 {Here Rd7 was a little better, forcing white's hand, but not much can be done now to save black.} 16. Ne5 {Rd1 was also possible, but I liked the possibilities of this move.} Bf5 {R(h)-f8 or Be6 were better.} 17. Nxf7 {The cherry on the sunday.} Rd7 {But this makes it worse. White now wins a full rook.} 18. Rxd7 Bxd7 19. Nxh8 Be6 {The only small compensation is that white's knight is stranded in the corner, but with white's material advantage, it is to no avail.} 20. Re1 Kd7 {Illustrates a peculiar kind of mistake. Black's d7 pawn looks well protected here. } 21. Bxc7 {But it is not, since the king must remain protect his bishop. Of course here, black could now play Bxa2, but after d3 the bishop is in a net, the rook will come and capture it and the white knight is freed.   So black rightfully gives up.  }
