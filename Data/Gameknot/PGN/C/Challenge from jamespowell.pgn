1. d4 {Book Move FIghts for the center, and I prefer this  to e4} d5 {Book Move The basic response} 2. c4 {Book Move indirectly fights for central control, and if recaptured e4 is to be played.} c6 {Book Move Best response to c4} 3. Nc3 {Book Move Develops a minor piece while increasing pressure upon the d5 pawn. } Qa5 {Possible premature move, that pins the night but exposes the queen and neglects the conventional system of trying to castle early.} 4. Bd2 {Develops another minor piece, and thought it blocks the queen file the d4 pawn is under no pressure, and if pressured, the night is moved b5 forcing the fork of the king and rook.} Qb4 {Two pronged attack threatening the c4 pawn, and the b2 pawn.   } 5. Nb5 {Forces the taking of either the b, or c pawn. In this situation taking the b2 pawn is the best decision. however the fork on c7 will still occur. } Qxc4 {?? Major mistake, is all that can be said.} 6. e3 {Trapped!!} Qxb5 {Best move in this situation.} 7. Bxb5 cxb5 8. Qb3 {Fork.} Nd7 9. Qxd5 Ngf6 {}
