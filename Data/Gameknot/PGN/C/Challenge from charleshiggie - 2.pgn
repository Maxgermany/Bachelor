1. e3 {This is a training game with me and a new player to my over-the-board club! We live in neighbouring villages! I am annotating it to help him learn!} e5 {e3 is not a bad opening move. It makes it hard for black to attack f2, and prepares to develop the Bf1.} 2. b3 {This is not a bad follow-up either.} d5 {I take the centre.} 3. Bb2 {He continues to develop - this is the logical follow-up to his previous move.} Bd6 {I protect the e5 pawn.} 4. c4 {This is a good move, chipping away on the black centre.} c6 {So I protect d5.} 5. cxd5 {Taking isn't bad, but I think it improves black's position more than white, as now Nb8 can go to c6.} cxd5 {I take back.} 6. Qe2 {This is a truly dreadful move. It blocks the diagonal for the bishop. White shouldn't be thinking of developing the queen so early. Instead 6. Nc3 and Bb4+ have been played before.} Nc6 {I play the knight out - partly because it is good development, but also because he was threatening to come to b5 with check.} 7. Qb5 {He goes to b5 anyway. Although the computer doesn't give it as a mistake, I think it is. He really needs to develop his knights and Bf1.} Nge7 {So I protect d5.} 8. a3 {Again not given as a mistake by the computer, but I think it is - he needs to develop his knights and Bf1.} O-O {I get my king to safety.} 9. h4 {This is not given as a mistake by the computer, but I think it is. He really needs to develop his knights and Bf1} Qc7 {I want to move Bc8 without losing b7.} 10. b4 {Yet another wasted move in my view!} Bd7 {Now I am threatening to move my Nc6, opening up the diagonal for my Bd7 and so attacking his queen.} 11. Qe2 {So the queen wisely retreats.} d4 {I try to open up the centre to his king.} 12. e4 {Computer says this is a mistake, but there is some logic in trying to keep the centre blocked with his king in the centre.} Kh8 {Computer doesn't like this move. I am preparing f7-f5} 13. g4 {White is still trying to attack before developing!} Ng6 {Computer doesn't like this move, but I think it is good, heading for f4.} 14. d3 {I think Nh3 is better, preventing my next.} Nf4 {So I hop in.} 15. Qf3 {Qd1 or even Qd2 was better, allowing f2-f3, defending the g pawn.} Qc8 {I put an additional attack on the g pawn. Computer prefers Nxb4} 16. Ne2 {At last he develops a knight! Well done!} Bxg4 {But the pawn falls.} 17. Qg3 {Queen moves.} f5 {I return to my older plan. Computer still likes Nxb4.} 18. f3 {Computer rightly prefers Nd2.} Nxd3+ {So I take the pawn.} 19. Kd2 {This is better than d1.} fxe4 {I take, with the plan that 20. f3xg4 is met with e3+ and 21. Kxd3 is met with e5-e4+ opening up the diagonal for my Bd6 to his queen on g3.} 20. fxe4 {But he takes this way instead.} Nxb2 {I take, although computer points out that Rf3 is stronger.} 21. Bh3 {This is an excellent defensive move, trying to exchange my attacking pieces, but it is too late.} Nxb4 {This opens up his king.} 22. axb4 {There is nothing better.} Bxb4+ {I take with check. His king has no squares, he is forced to block with a knight.} 23. Nbc3 {He at last develops the knight!} dxc3+ {I take!} 24. Nxc3 {He takes back. He is lost!} Bxc3+ {I take again!} 25. Qxc3 {This is a mistake, in a lost position.} Rf2+ {I played this to win the queen.} 26. Ke1 {Now I see a way of winning the king instead!} Re2+ {This check drives the king onto the f file.} 27. Kf1 {Forced!} Qf8+ {I am mating now!} 28. Kg1 {Nearly over!} Qf2# {And now mate finished him off! Many thanks for reading this, please rate it on the star system and leave a comment or two!}
