1. e4 {is it just me, or is once popular e4 fading into nonexsistence. I see it less and less.} e6 2. Nf3 c5 3. Nc3 {ten best?} Nf6 {this is the first problem with my opening. I'm almost defenseless against the obvious e5 push. my only response would be to throw my knight over to d5, offering a trade which messes up my pawn structure that I like so much about this opening.} 4. d3 {o...k....} d5 {now my knight has nowhere to go, except possibly d7 for a defensive game.} 5. exd5 exd5 {Qe2 for cheap check? no} 6. d4 {offering a trade, which would basically ruin my entire 'control' of middle board.} c4 {there is a really awesome move coming up really soon.} 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 {!  as common of a move as this is, I've never seen it played against my opening before.} Be7 {possibility to castle} 9. Be2 {doing the same?} O-O {if you haven't noticed, black has (almost) all the momentum at this point.} 10. b3 {right here. there is an amazing attack. do you see it? I missed it for a few turns.} b5 11. a4 Bb4 {give yourself ten points if you saw that move. proper response for black is R-anywhere but a3, preferably a2} 12. Qd2 {this is my biggest blunder of the game. thank goodness white missed an oppurtunity here. } Qe8 {though it seems like an ok move, the following moves would be (if white had seen it, of course) 13 Bxf6 gxf6 14. Qxh6... I got lucky. best possible move (or so my coach says) is Qd6. comments?} 13. axb5 {opening up the file for an escape? not going to happen.} Ne4 {this is why I moved my queen in the first place, so I wouldn't lose it to Ne4. the queen is forced to move with very few good moves. } 14. Qd1 {Temptation to take with knight is pretty high. but the queen would just return to d2, and I will have pinned myself. notice, though, possible 14 ...Nxc3 15... Qxe2#} Bxc3+ {this is where the game really just tips in my favor} 15. Kf1 Bxa1 16. Qxa1 Qxb5 {free pawn} 17. bxc4 dxc4 18. Rg1 Bg4 {the knight must die.} 19. h3 Bxf3 20. gxf3 {the threat of g7 is overwhelming bu I have somewhat of a plan. It's not too bad as long as Ne4 and d4 are in their places} Nd2+ {that being said: the first thing I do is move the knight. but I'm up a rook. it's time for a queen trade} 21. Ke1 {logical, right?} Qb4 {could this be the attack I've been waiting for? no.} 22. Kd1 Qb1+ {forced queen trade.} 23. Qxb1 Nxb1 {another good move for black is 24... Nc3. } 24. Bxc4 Nc6 {is this a mistake? no. even though potential pin Bd5 might happen, there is a plan.} 25. Bd5 {shoot. whatever will i do?} Nc3+ 26. Kd2 Nxd5 {White resigns here, and the game is over. I have simply too much of an advantage. up a minor, a rook and I have a completely infallable pawn run in the a column, which, if doesn't gain me a queen, will gain me one of the last two of whites pieces. }
