1. d4 {This is a fun little game between my father and I.  d4 is the strongest open for each of us and usually leads to the King's Indian Defense (KID).  Which it so happens this game does as well.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 {KID main line.} e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 {Still all opening theory which we each know fairly well.} 9. Ne1 {The older main line.  White also has the bayonet attack b4.  I prefer this line.} Nd7 10. Nd3 {Book is 10. f3 f5 11. Bd3 f4 12. Bf2  I play this to make challenge to c5 sooner rather than later though gives up the bishops chance to take up residence on the a7 g1 diagonal.} f5 11. b4 {Planing c5 soon.} c6 12. Qb3 {the a2-g8 diagonal is going to open up.} fxe4 13. Nxe4 Nf6 {Clears e4 for e5e4.} 14. Nxf6+ Bxf6 15. dxc6 {Begins to open the diagonal I mentioned earlier.} Nxc6 16. c5+ d5 {Blocks the diagonal and gives black a nice center with a passed pawn.} 17. Rb1 {Gets off the a1-h8 diagonal.} e4 18. Nf4 Nd4 {(!) wins the two bishops in an opening position.} 19. Qd1 Nxe2+ 20. Qxe2 Be5 21. Nxd5 {Only thing I could think of to challenge blacks center.  My plan will be to take control of the newly opened d-file.} Qxd5 22. Bh6 {Connecting the rooks with tempo.} Rf5 {Rf5? gives up control of the d-file.} 23. Rbd1 Bd4 {Bd4 Be3 wins the bishop.  Allowing a possible drawn position.} 24. Kh1 {I see that the bishop isn't going anywhere for a while and can still be won if Qe5 Via Qc4+} Qe5 {Threatening Rh5. } 25. g4 {stops rook h5} Rf7 {Rf3 was also possible.} 26. Qc4 {Pins the rook and wins the bishop.} Bxc5 {??? leads to mate.} 27. Rd8+ {and mate to follow.}
