1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {Sicilian Defence Four Knight Variation.} 6. Bb5 {Not a book move. Probably Nxc6 was better.} Bb4 {Ms. Hannah thought over this for a while and exploited my non-book opening.} 7. Bxc6 bxc6 8. e5 Nd5 9. Bd2 Nxc3 10. bxc3 {Doubled pawn. I decided to take with the pawn to minimize exchange of pieces.} Be7 11. O-O Qc7 12. Re1 d6 {Not sure about this move. Probably castling looks better. } 13. Bf4 {I decided to complicate the position, hoping to mitigate the doubled pawn weakness.} dxe5 {Ms. Hannah takes the pawn. I was expecting her to play d5.} 14. Bxe5 Bd6 {Sharp. I thought over this for a while and decided to play Bxg7 in exchange for Ms. Hannahs Bxh2.} 15. Bxg7 Bxh2+ 16. Kh1 Rg8 17. Bf6 {Here, computer says Nf5 was a move with winning advantage. Unfortunately I didnt see this move until later (see ahead)} Qf4 {Blunder. Computer says this gives white an advantage of +3 as ahead. Rg6 would have resulted in a better game for black.} 18. Nf5 {I thought over this for a long time and saw the move Nf5. Pawn cant take the knight due to pin, and Queen cant because of Qd8++. I couldnt calculate completely the variation of Blacks Bd7, everything else looked good for white. Fortunately, Ms. Hannah didnt play Bd7.} Ba6 19. Rxe6+ {The winning Rook sacrifice. Black doesnt have much options now} fxe6 20. Qh5+ {Rest is technique.} Rg6 21. Qxh7 Kf8 22. Qxg6 Qxf5 23. Qg7+ Ke8 24. Qe7# {Great sharp game. Huge sigh of relief and excitation.}
