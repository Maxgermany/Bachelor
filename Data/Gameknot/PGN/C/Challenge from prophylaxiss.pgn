1. e4 {French Defense, Winawer, Advance Variation, C18} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Qa5 {6...Ne7 is the main line here, with 6...Qc7 the second most popular.  6...Qa5 comes in third place...it's primary disadvantage being on the a-file will be seen 10 moves hence...as the saying goes, when the cat's away, the mice do play...or, as master war strategist Sun Tzu said centuries ago, "Offer the opponent a bait to lure him; feign disorder and strike him" (The Art of War, 1:20).} 7. Bd2 Qa4 8. Qb1 c4 9. Ne2 Nc6 {Notice how effectively this knight does the work, as Lasker would say, of keeping her queen boxed in or obstructed on the queenside, since it prevents retreat along the a4-e8 diagonal...} 10. Ng3 Nge7 {10...Bd7 appears to be a stronger move, based upon past performance results...} 11. Be2 {11. Nh5 is most often played here, but I decided to get out of the book on this move, in the hope that my opponent would castle short, since White is angling for a kingside attack...as Sun Tzu says, "If I am able to determine the opponent's dispositions while at the same time I conceal my own then I can concentrate and he must divide.  And if I concentrate while he divides, I can use my entire strength to attack a fraction of his.  There, I will be numerically superior.  Then, if I am able to use many to strike few at a selected point, those I deal with will be in dire straits...For if he does not know where I intend to give battle, he must prepare in a great many places.  And when he prepares in a great many places, those I have to fight in any one place will be few.  For if he prepares to the front his rear will be weak, and if to the rear, his front will be fragile.  If he prepares to the left, his right will be vulnerable and if to the right, there will be few on his left.  And when he prepares everywhere, he will be weak everywhere...Therefore, determine the opponent's plans and you will know which strategy will be successful and which will not" (ibid., 6:13-15, 20).} O-O {...and Black complies...unfortunately for him...} 12. O-O b6 13. Qc1 {Forming an important battery with the dark-squared bishop, while simultaneously protecting c2.} Ba6 14. Nh5 Kh8 15. Re1 Ng6 16. Bg5 {14. Nh5 and 16. Bg5 exemplify Tal's concept of launching, which he discusses in his magnificent book, "Attack With Mikhail Tal", co-authored with Iakov Damsky.  Tal writes, "...in ice hockey this concept has existed since the game was born.  The point of it is that the puck ends up close to the goal, but no one knows what will happen with it next...when I 'launch' a piece close to the enemy king, I never aim it at only one point...this is one version of concentrating force, only without a clear and single aim planned beforehand" (1999 ed., p. 46).  Tal is in accordance with Sun Tzu, who said in The Art of War, "...create changes in the situation by dispersal and concentration of forces" (7:12) and "The ultimate in disposing one's troops is to be without ascertainable shape...It is according to the shapes that I lay the plans for victory, but the multitude does not comprehend this.  Although everyone can see the outward aspects, none understands the way in which I have created victory" (6:24-25).} Rfc8 {Now Black has only one piece left to defend his kingside, as 5 of his pieces are AWOL on the queenside...so White decides to strike while the iron is hot with a Tal-like or Nezhmetdinov-like sacrifice...} 17. Nxg7 {Although this may appear to be a king's field sacrifice, as Rudolf Spielmann has classified in his epic book, "The Art of Sacrifice in Chess", upon closer examination it turns out to be a sham (temporary) sacrifice, since after a series of forced moves, White "recovers the invested material with advantage..." (1995 ed., p. 4).} Kxg7 18. Bh6+ {"Now an army may be likened to water, for just as flowing water avoids the heights and hastens to the lowlands, so an army avoids strength and strikes weakness.  And as water shapes its flow in accordance with the ground, so an army manages its victory in accordance with the situation of the opponent" (The Art of War, 6:27-28).} Kg8 19. Qg5 {"Appear at places to which he must hasten; move swiftly where he does not expect you.  To be certain to take what you attack is to attack a place the opponent does not protect.  He whose advance is irresistible plunges into his opponent's weak positions..." (ibid., 6:5,7,10).  And as a sidenote, compare the mobility of White's queen to that of Black's queen...} f6 {19...f5 is worse for Black, e.g., 20. Bh5! Ncxe5 21. Rxe5 Qe8 22. Rae1 Qe7 23. Qxe7 Nxe7 24. Rxe6 and White is up a pawn and has tremendous pressure on Black's center and kingside...} 20. Qxf6 {"When the strike of a hawk breaks the body of its prey, it is because of timing.  Thus, the momentum of one skilled in war is overwhelming, and his attack precisely regulated" (ibid., 5:14-15).} Rc7 {"Thus, those skilled at making the opponent move do so by creating a situation to which he must conform..." (ibid., 5:20).} 21. Qxe6+ Rf7 22. Qxd5 Rd8 23. Qe4 {So now White has 4 pawns for the knight, 3 connected center passed pawns, and pressure on Black's castled kingside.  Black tries to regroup his pieces, but he doesn't have enough time...} Bb7 24. e6 {Passed pawns must be pushed...especially when one is a piece down...and this could be considered the decisive move...Sun Tzu, "Conformation of the ground is of the greatest assistance in battle.  Therefore, to estimate the opponent's situation and to calculate distances and the degree of difficulty of the terrain so as to control victory are virtues of the superior general.  He who fights with full knowledge of these factors is certain to win; he who does not will surely be defeated" (ibid., 10:17).} Re7 25. Bh5 Na5 26. Qg4 Qe8 27. f4 Bc8 {Trying to kill the e6 pawn, but Black just doesn't have enough time, since White's f-pawn strikes first...As Sun Tzu said, "Speed is the essence of war.  Take advantage of the opponent's unpreparedness; travel by unexpected routes and strike him where he has taken no precautions.  The general principles applicable to an invading force are that when you have penetrated deeply into hostile territory, your army is united and the defender cannot overcome you" (ibid., 11:29-30).} 28. f5 Rd5 29. Ref1 Bxe6 30. Bxg6 hxg6 31. fxe6 Kh7 32. Rf8 {Sun Tzu, "Ground equally advantageous for the opponent or me to occupy is key ground...in key ground I would hasten up my rear elements" (ibid., 11:4,17).} Nc6 33. Rxe8 Rxe8 34. Rf1 {And here the opponent resigned, as he did not want to be further kept under a strain and worn down (ibid., 1:24)...}
