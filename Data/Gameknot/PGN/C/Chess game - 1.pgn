[Opening "Lengfellner system (C00)"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d6 {The Lengfellner System (C00)? } 3. Nc3 b6 {I thought about Nf3 here but it doesn't seem aggressive enough.} 4. f4 Bb7 5. Nf3 g6 {White now is looking to play f5 to break up the position.  It's a longer term goal but it seems ideal with black's LSB on b7.} 6. Bd3 Bg7 7. Be3 {Reinforces d4 I thought black might play c5 with maybe Ne7.  Really I guess it's just development.} Nf6 8. Qd2 {A mistake of sorts maybe I should have played h3 to prevent the next move but I was thinking of castling queen side.} Ng4 {So I let the exchange happen thinking maybe I can get f5 in quickly since black is spending tempi to get the minor exchange.} 9. O-O Nxe3 10. Qxe3 O-O {White has a slight lead in development so... It's time to open the position.} 11. f5 {Black decides to go for control of the e-file} exf5 12. exf5 Re8 13. Qf4 Qf6 {Pins the f pawn to the queen and stops any thought of f6 temporarily.} 14. Rfe1 {the other rook would have been better} Nd7 {Connecting the rooks and hoping white will trade. White has a slight initiative so its better to find a way to get pieces to the kingside where white has the play.} 15. Ne4 {I thought black would play Bxe4 or Qxf5.  If 15. ..., Qxf5 then 16. Qxf5, gxf5 17. Ng3, f4 18. Nh5 and regains the pawn with  well placed pieces.  ( This was faulty however as Bxf3 followed by Bxd4ch is a crusher!  So 15.Ne4 is a mistake that turns out better than it should.  - 3 min games!?! )} Qd8 16. Neg5 {16. ..., h3 is now met by 17. fxg6, hxg5  18. gxf7ch, Kh8  19. fxe8=Qch and black will be be devastated here. I used most of what time I had left here ( 22 seconds left )} Qf6 {The queen comes back looking for a draw?} 17. Bc4 {Provoking black's next move with the threat on f7. } d5 18. Bd3 {This sets up the e5 square for occupying by the knight.} c5 {18. ..h6 was probably best but this threat to d4 seems strong.} 19. Ne5 {Threatens Nxd7and Ngxf7.  The best response is Re7 but black is now under a minute on the clock.} Nf8 {Yes white can now grab the f pawn but white's d pawn will hang with a trade of queens and capture with check so white has to protect the d4.} 20. c3 c4 21. Bc2 {It was also good to have a retreat for the bishop ( 14 seconds left ).} b5 {Black must have overlooked the f pawn ( black has 25 seconds left ).} 22. Ngxf7 a5 {Black's king position is falling apart Re7 would be better.} 23. Nh6+ {If black doesn't trade then Nef7ch forces black to give up his queen for a knight!} Bxh6 24. Qxh6 Qg7 {Hoping to trade queens and end the attack.} 25. Qg5 {White is threatening fxg6 and f6 both of which the next move seems to stop.  ( 25. ..., gxf6 might have been best to get rid of the f pawn.} Ra6 26. Ref1 {This is why the wrong rook was moved earlier, it takes a tempo to put it back. The f6 threat is back on. } Rf6 {Seems things are defended but} 27. Ng4 {Black can give up the exchange and play on but} Rd6 28. f6 h6 29. Nxh6+ {Black resigns.}
