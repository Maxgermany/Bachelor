1. e4 {In this game I make a horrendous mistake which gave me a lost position. I fight back and gain an advantage in the ending. The big question is whether or not I missed a win towards the end.} c5 {So it starts with a Sicilian Defence.} 2. Nf3 {He continues with the usual.} Nc6 {As do I.} 3. Bb5 {This is a popular alternative to 3. d2-d4} e6 {I prepare to bring my Ng8 to support its colleague.} 4. O-O {He castles.} Nge7 {I continue.} 5. Re1 {He prepares a retreat square for his bishop.} a6 {I hit the bishop.} 6. Bf1 {It retreats.} d5 {So I make a claim to the centre.} 7. exd5 {He takes.} Nxd5 {I take back, opening up a diagonal for my Bf8.} 8. d4 {He finally does the d2-d4 break.} Nf6 {This retreat adds pressure to d4. Post Game Computer Analysis (PGCA) says this is a mistake, and prefers the simple Be7, but this move has been played before, with good results. 8.....Nf6 is in fact the most popular move in both the Gameknot opening databases.} 9. Be3 {Which he supports.} Ng4 {I "threaten" to take one of his bishops. In an open position like this, the bishops are slightly better than the knight.} 10. c3 {He gives more support to d4. 10. d5 is the move given in both the previous games with this variation. We are now out of my opening databases.} Be7 {So I develop.} 11. h3 {He attacks my knight. PGCA says this is a mistake, and gives 11. Bf4 cxd4 12. cxd4 O-O 13. Nc3 Qb6 14. Na4 Qa5 15. Rc1 Bb4 16. Re2 Rd8 17. Bg5 Rd5 as best for both sides, but} Nxe3 {So I take. } 12. fxe3 {He takes back.} O-O {I finally castle.} 13. Nbd2 {He develops.} b5 {I gain space on the queen side.} 14. Bd3 {He improves the position of his bishop.} Bb7 {I develop.} 15. Be4 {I am not sure this really helps his position much.} Qb6 {Preparing to move the rooks to the central files.} 16. Nh2 {Not sure that this helps him much either. Computer how gives  f5 17. Bf3 Bd6 18. Nhf1 Qc7 19. dxc5 Bxc5 20. Qb3 Rae8 21. Rad1 Qb6 22. a4 Rf7 23. axb5 axb5 as best with advantage to black. Now I thought, this move takes away protection of h4, and his dark squares round his king are slightly weak. How can I exploit this? I saw Bh4 seemed to attack his Re1 and fix those weaknesses, and so.....} Bh4 {I played this. OK stop and work out white's next move!} 17. Qh5 {I'm sure you spotted that! I am already in trouble as he attacks by bishop and threatens mate on h7. Work out black best reply.} f5 {So I counter attack his bishop.} 18. Qxh4 {He takes mine.} fxe4 {I take his.} 19. Nxe4 {He takes with the knight, attacking c5.} cxd4 {So I exchange.} 20. Ng5 {He threatens mate.} h6 {This is more or less forced.} 21. Nxe6 {So he takes here.} Rfe8 {This seems a natural move, but computer prefers  dxc3 22. Nxf8 cxb2 23. Rab1 Rxf8 24. Rxb2 Ne5 25. Rd2 Qa5 26. Ree2 Nc4 27. Rd4 Qa3 28. Rd7 Qc1+ 29. Re1} 22. Nxd4 {So now he is just two clear pawns up, and have hardly any compensation. Computer prefers 22. exd4 Ne5 23. Nc5 Bd5 24. Ng4 Nxg4 25. Qxg4 Qc6 26. Nd7 h5 27. Qf5 Be4 28. Ne5 Bxf5 29. Nxc6} Ne5 {I see c4 as a nice square for my knight.} 23. Re2 {Preparing to double rooks maybe?} Nc4 {So my knight hops in.} 24. Ng4 {He gets this knight back into the game.} Re4 {I pin it. The rook is protected by my bishop on b7 so Nxh6+ or Nf6+ don't work yet.} 25. Qg3 {He is hoping for something clever on the g file.} Rae8 {This seems a very natural move, but computer gives it as a mistake and prefers  Qd6 26. Qxd6 Nxd6 27. Rd1 Rc8 28. Kh2 h5 29. Nf2 Re7 30. Nf3 Re6 31. Ng5 Rf6 32. e4 Rd8} 26. Nf5 {Computer says this is a blunder and gives 26. Rf1 (threatening Nf6+) Kh8 27. b3 Qd6 28. Nf5 Qxg3 29. Nxg3 Rxg4 30. hxg4 Rxe3 31. bxc4 Rxg3 32. Rf7 Bc6 33. cxb5 axb5 White is now threatening Ng4xh6+} Kh7 {This seems to me to be the natural defence, but computer prefers  Qg6 27. Rf1 R4e6 28. e4 Kh8 29. e5 a5 30. Nh4 Qh5 31. Rf5 g5 32. Nf3 Rd8 33. Nf6} 27. b3 {Computer prefers 27. Nf2 Qg6 28. Nxe4 Bxe4 29. Qxg6+ Kxg6 30. Nd4 Bd3 31. Rf2 Nxe3 32. Re1 Re4 33. g3 a5 34. a3 Re8 Black's game is hanging by a thread. Any knight move is met with Nd6 winning the exchange. Black has only one move.} Qg6 {Black must counter-attack!} 28. Nh4 {Again, causing problems for black. His Nc4 and Qg6 are both attacked. Once again there is onyl one move.} Qd6 {This! Black prevents any further material loss, but it means there is an exchange of queens, and black is still two pawns down. Still his remaining pieces have all taken up sensible posts.} 29. Qxd6 {So the queens come off. } Nxd6 {Black takes back.} 30. Nf3 {The knight comes back, perhaps to be re-deployed at d4.} Re4e7 {I prepare to attack down the c file.} 31. Rae1 {He doubles on the e file.} Rc7 {So I switch to the c file.} 32. Rc1 {He protects.} Rec8 {I double up. It is hard for him to defend, as Re2-c2 is met by Bb7-e4, chasing away a protector.} 33. Nd4 {So he resigns himself to the loss of one of his extra pawns and centralises his knight.} Rc7xc3 {So I take.} 34. Rxc3 {he takes back.} Rxc3 {I take him.} 35. Rc2 {He tries to exchange the other rooks - normally a good plan if you are materially ahead.} b4 {I protect my rook.} 36. Rxc3 {Although not given as a mistake by white, this looks wrong, giving black a strong passed pawn close to the queening square. PGCA now gives black a very small advantage.} bxc3 {So I take back.} 37. Nf2 {He prevents my bishop from reaching e4 and helps stop my c pawn advancing.} Kg6 {I start to mobilise my king.} 38. Nd3 {Knight comes over again.} Be4 {My bishop comes in.} 39. Nc1 {Knight firmly blocks the promotion square.} h5 {A king side push, I am hoping to get in h5-h4 and tie his king down to the protection of g2} 40. Nce2 {He attacks my pawn.} c2 {So I advance it.} 41. g3 {He removes the pawn from g2, but weakens his h3 pawn.} Nf5 {I attack g3, e3 and d4, although the only one not protected is e3.} 42. Kf2 {His king comes up to protect.} Kf6 {My king comes across.} 43. Nxf5 {He takes.} Bxf5 {I take back hitting h3. He has problems here. Kg2 means his king is very passive, while my king can just  walk into the queen side and win. H3-h4 leaves his king side pawns weak and perhaps vulnerable to my king. He decides to give up a pawn, which may be his best plan.} 44. Ke1 {Instead he goes after my pawn.} Bxh3 {So I take, leveling the material.} 45. Kd2 {he attacks my pawn.} Bf5 {I protect it.} 46. b4 {Perhaps trying to get something going on the queen side?} g5 {And I do something similar on the king side.} 47. Ng1 {King comes back to defend.} h4 {I push on.} 48. gxh4 {He takes.} gxh4 {I take back.} 49. a4 {He pushes on the queen side again.} Ke6 {This is a mistake. If Ke5? he at least draws with Nf3+. The big question is, would 49. Ke7 win for black? PGCA gives Ke7 50. b5 axb5 51. axb5 Kd7 52. Kc1 Kc7 53. Kb2 Kb6 54. Kc1 Be4 55. Nh3 Bg6 56. Nf2 Kxb5 57. e4 h3 58. Kxc2 h2 as best for both sides. After 58. Kxc2 we have a total of 6 pieces left which can be analysed perfectly using the endgame database, and it tells me that the position is drawn, it is still draws, unless there is an improvement in that line somewhere?} 50. Nf3 {Knight comes up.} h3 {Pawn advances.} 51. Ng5+ {This check picks up the pawn.} Kd5 {And draw agreed. After 52. Nxh3 Bxh3 53. Kxc2 black is left with the wrong bishop, so even if he picks up all white's pawns, his bishop doesn't control the queening square of the a pawn, so it is drawn. It was agreed drawn at this point.
