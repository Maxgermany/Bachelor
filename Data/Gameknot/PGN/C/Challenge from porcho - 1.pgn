[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Lundin (Kevitz-Mikenas) defence"]

1. d4 Nc6 {I think this is a bit of a mistake as I can chase him.} 2. d5 e5 {?? And this is the blunder. I guess he just wasn't thinking.} 3. dxc6 Qf6 {This opponent always tries to get scholar's mate, but much better would have been taking my pawn.} 4. cxd7+ Bxd7 {Well I'm up by three points so I thought "Well this should be easy" Yeah...easy} 5. e4 Bc5 6. Nf3 {I was feeling pretty good, not paying much attention and basically underestimating my opponent since I was ahead. I didn't notice that he had three pieces developed to my one.} Bg4 7. Be2 Bxf3 8. Bxf3 Qh4 {He tries a different approach... } 9. g3 Qh3 {Uh-oh, I can't castle. } 10. Bg4 {I felt really clever making this move, I thought "ha! to stop me from playing Qd7+ he has to give up his queen!" I didn't realize I guess that it wouldn't do much.} Qg2 11. Qd7+ Kf8 {Uh... Now what?} 12. Rf1 {Defend rook} Ne7 13. Be3 Qxe4 {Uh oh... Pawn gone. What do I do now? I know, play like an idiot} 14. Ke2 {I saw that he could play Bxe3 f2xe3 Qxe3+ so I decided to defend my bishop. Why I couldn't have just played Nc3 counterattacking his queen is a mystery.} Qxc2+ {Um pawn gone... What do I do now?} 15. Nd2 {Block and develop at the same time. And lose another pawn} Bd6 16. Bg5 {I was trying to keep up my 'attack' although I was still leaving my pawn hanging.} Nc6 17. Bh5 Nd4+ 18. Ke1 Qf5 19. Qxf5 {I thought: Oh good, now the danger's over, his queen is gone and I've got an easy game. After all, I'm up a knight. I guess I didn't realize that I was also down two pawns.} Nxf5 20. Bg4 {Well in hindsight I have to admit that white is better. But I played pretty badly earlier.} Nd4 {Threatens a very obvious fork that suddenly I miss} 21. Ne4 {See what I mean by I was playing like a 1st class idiot?} Nc2+ 22. Kd1 Nxa1 23. Re1 f6 24. Bh4 Rd8 {Well look how the tides have turned. Suddenly he's up by four points (Though his knight won't live long) and threatening a tactic that surprisingly I see. I guess the shock of his fork brought me back to reality.} 25. Kc1 Bb4 26. Re3 Rd4 27. Bf5 Rc4+ {? Just drives my king closer to his knight} 28. Nc3 {...Better would have been Kb1} Rd4 29. Kb1 Bxc3 30. Rxc3 Rd1+ 31. Rc1 Rd4 {I'm starting to think: Hey, my position isn't terrible. After I win his knight I've got the bishop pair against his rook.} 32. Kxa1 Kf7 33. Rxc7+ {Oh yay I've equalized and I think white has the advantage now.} Kg8 34. a3 {I saw something very nice involving his back rank and my bishops that would win his rook, I bet you can find it, but first I had to deal with my back rank.} Rd1+ 35. Ka2 g6 {???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Joy! This is probably the worst move he could have played.} 36. Be6+ {High-yah! I now see the possibility of more than winning his rook} Kf8 37. Bxf6 Ke8 38. Rc8+ Rd8 39. Rxd8# {And checkmate. While not a great game I felt it would be funny to annotate.}
