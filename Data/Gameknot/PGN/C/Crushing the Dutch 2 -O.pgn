1. d4 f5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. h4 {Let's question the Dutch at once. } Be7 5. h5 {Why not? The pawn is safe, g6 is bad for black. } h6 {Stopping the pawn, but letting a wide hole on g6. } 6. Ne5 {So, with six "unnatural" moves, I have a grimp on black.} Nd5 {I calculated here that I could lose the bishop for developing the queen.} 7. Qd2 O-O {But he doesn't take it!} 8. Bxh6 {Almost without thinking. } gxh6 9. Qxh6 Rf6 {Ng6 didn't give me lots.} 10. Qg5+ Kh7 11. h6 {Threatening, but fearing the attack will lose steam. What can I save from it?} Qg8 12. Qxg8+ Kxg8 13. h7+ Kh8 {Well, a "hard to attack" pawn on h7... not bad. Oh, a pawn less, of course.} 14. g4 {The only way I saw to "do something" but leave him develop. If d6, g4.} fxg4 15. c4 {I don't want to give him tempo, but I finally will have to. } Nb4 16. Na3 {Well, I developed the knight on a bad square, but I have a freeway to castling. } d6 17. Nxg4 Rf4 {I didn't foresee before d4 will fall. } 18. Ne3 Rxd4 {Now, a knight on c2 is mate. But I have another threat.} 19. Nb5 {Deadly. But black can try something... Bd8.} Bd7 20. Nxc7 {Cashing the wrong rook! In fact, it is very dangerous to leave this central black dominance.} Nb8c6 21. Nxa8 Ne5 {It's incredible black hasn't found a way to mate me.} 22. a3 Nbc6 23. b3 Na5 24. Rb1 {Paying the price of taking the wrong rook. Now black has all his pieces active...} Bc6 25. Rh6 {...so I went for the pawns.} Bg5 {Mixing up things...} 26. Nc2 Be4 27. Nxd4 {Finally removing the annoying central rook.} Bxb1 28. Rxe6 Kxh7 29. Rxd6 Nac6 30. Nxc6 Nxc6 31. e3 {Contolling the bishops and freeing mine before getting greedy.} Be7 32. Rd7 Kg6 33. Rxb7 Bxa3 34. Bg2 Ne5 35. Rxa7 {No pawns, no hope for black. } Bb4+ 36. Kf1 Bd3+ 37. Kg1 {Shielded the king, there is no plan for black. }
