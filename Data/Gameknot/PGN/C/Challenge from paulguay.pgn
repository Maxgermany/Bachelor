1. e4 {"E4, best by test!" - R. Fischer} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Defends e5 and allows light bishop to develop; blocks development of dark bishop and loses some time as it is not developing a piece.  Better Nc6 or Nf6 (Petroff's defense).} 3. Bc4 {Rapid piece development, eyes naturally weak f7 square, allows for king side castling.  Other strong moves would include Nc3 (developing) and d4 directly challenging the center.} Nf6 {Strong move as it develops a piece and attacks white pawn in the center.} 4. Nc3 {Developing move that protects e4.  At first blush seems to blunder into 4. ... Nxe4  5. Nxe4 d5 with a piece fork.  However after 4. ... Nxe4 the intermezzo move 5. Bxf7+ Kxf7 6. Nxe4 gives white the advantage (white with lead in development, black unable to castle).} d5 {This move perhaps is motivated by a desire to challenge the center and/or the white light-squared bishop.  However it is a mistake for a few reasons.  First, it does not develop a piece.  Remember it is paramount to develop the minor pieces as quickly as possible in the opening.  Second, it is best not to move a piece (or pawn) twice in the opening unless there is a compelling reason.  Third, after 5. exd5 black will simply lose this pawn.  Much better would have been 4. ... Be7 preparing to castle or Bg4 setting up a pin against the white queen.} 5. exd5 {Bxd5 also possible but why give up a well-placed bishop?} Bg4 {Good developing move that pins the white knight and threatens e4 on the following move.} 6. d3 {There are a few options to meet the threat of e4.  Perhaps the strongest would be to "put the question" to the black bishop by playing h3.  However, if black then continues with e4 anyway, after hxg4 white's king-side pawns will be a bit disrupted.  I elected to play d3, which nullifies the threat of e4 and allows an exit for the dark bishop.  Another playable move would be Qe2.} Bb4 {Strong developing move, pinning an important white piece protecting the d5 pawn and putting pressure on the center.  Threatens to win back the d5 pawn.} 7. Bd2 {Develops the bishop and breaks the pin.  If 7. ... Bxc3  8. Bxc3 black can win the d5 pawn with Nxc5, but white will remain up a pawn after Bxe5.} O-O {Probably the best move.} 8. O-O {Completes development and improves king safety.} Nbd7 {Solid move, completing development and protecting e5 pawn.} 9. Ne4 {Various playable moves including Re1 and h3.  This move was chosen to force trade down of pieces while maintaining the pawn advantage.} Bxd2 {This is black's strongest option and better than Nxe4.  Nxe4 would allow dxe4 where white supports the e5 pawn giving him a strong center.  After the played move Bxd2, white must decide between capturing with the knight he just moved and capturing with the queen.} 10. Nexd2 {I have elected to avoid the doubled f pawns that could arise after 10. Qxd2 Bxf3.  It should be noted that doubled f pawns are not necessarily a weakness, and are often preferred by players such as Nigel Short.  One advantage for white would be the possibility of putting a rook on the half-open g file applying pressure towards the black king.  However, the doubled f pawns can make the white king vulnerable (not everyone is as expert at defending as Nigel Short, including me!) so I have captured with the knight.} a6 {This move prepares for b5, pressuring white's bishop.  However, the bishop will have a safe retreat to b3 anyway.  Black would be on the verge of winning back the pawn on d5 with a more aggressive move such as Nb6.} 11. Bb3 {Black's prior move a6 allows white time to retreat the bishop, preparing for c4.  Another option would be to move the queen from behind the pin.} Re8 {Moves rook to the center supporting e5 and helping prepare for possible push to e4 at some point.  Centralizing rooks and/or placing them on open or half-open files is a good general theme to remember after completing minor piece development.} 12. h3 {Forces black to make a decision regarding the pinning bishop, while creating luft for the white king with tempo.  The timing of if and when to create space for your king can be a tricky thing.  Too early and you can neglect development giving your opponent the edge.  Too late and you can find yourself with serious back-rank problems.  Another good move would have been Re1 shoring up against the threat of e4.  } Bh5 13. Re1 {Centralizing the rook and placing it on the half-open file.} Nb6 {This would have been strong on move 10 instead of a6, but here it really just allows white to proceed with his plan to play c4.  Perhaps better would have been Nc5 after which black will have the option of capturing the light-squared bishop ( if 13. ... Nc5 Bc4 then b5 forces bishop back ).} 14. c4 {This move solidifies the d5 pawn which up to this point has been fairly weak and a good target for black.  It also creates a space for the white queen to step out from behind the pin to c2.} Qd6 {At this stage of the game, moving the queen to a more central position and connecting the rooks is a very good thought.  You must take care though not to place the queen in a position where it can be attacked by minor pieces.  In this case, white can play Ne4 next if he chooses, with the option of further trading down pieces.  White's plan has been to step out of the pin to c2, and we see now that he can do this with tempo, as it threatens c5 next forking the knight and queen.  ( For any following, we just discovered Paul was unaware of the annotation feature and has been playing without the benefit of my comments).} 15. Qc2 {A very satisfying move, stepping out of the pin (finally), threatening c5, connecting rooks, and exerting additional control on the e4 square via the diagonal.  The white queen is potentially heading for c3, after which it will be difficult for black to defend his weak pawn on e5.}
