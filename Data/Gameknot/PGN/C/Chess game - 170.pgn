1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d3 g6 {Closed Sicilian} 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 e6 {This is all normal opening theory, however normally you tell your kids to develop the bishop and nights fast, in this case black want to open the center, less good (from my point) would be d6 followed by Bg4, as the only thing the bishop can do is to exchange with the night (after h3), I could also consider d6, Be6, Qd7 and put the Bishop on h3, but normally white have too many good moves in the meantime and I need the other pices to help me.} 6. Nbd2 Nge7 {As I want to play f5, this allow me to open the f-line.} 7. O-O O-O 8. h4 f5 {Normally the rule is if your opponent attack one flank, you should (if your position allow it) open or attach in the center.} 9. h5 d5 10. Nb3 fxe4 11. dxe4 c4 {Black gets control of the center, the white "attack" on the king-flank is not working.} 12. Nbd4 Nxd4 13. Nxd4 Qb6 {Black put a preasure on d4 and in-direct on f2 and b2, I would say that black have a small advantage, white pices are almost all on the first line.} 14. c3 {If white tried Be3 instead, he would loose at least one pawn (b2)} e5 15. Nc2 d4 {Black has a very easy position, all he need to do is to protect it and improve when he  can.} 16. Bg5 Nc6 {I need the night in the center, his bishop is weak.} 17. Qd2 Be6 18. Bh6 {White continue his "attack", I guess it is difficult to find better solutions, but he only have 1 pice in the attack and that does not win.} Bxh6 19. Qxh6 Rf6 {Protect the g6 pawn and prepare for double rooks in the f-line, i.e. a strong black attack and control in the center.} 20. hxg6 {Not sure if this was good for white, he open an extra line in my attack and remove his only pice from the attack, I would have thought that putting his rooks in the h-line or opening the f-line (after moving the king) would have been better.} Rxg6 21. Qd2 Rd8 {A good rule in a good position is to keep the preasure, normally your opponent will make a mistake if you continue to do that.} 22. Rab1 {First mistake - he should have exchanged on d4 with 22.cxd4, exd4 23.Na3, Ne5 24.Rad1,Qc5 (allow to switch to the king-flank) 25.Nc2,Bg4 26.f3,Bxf3 27.Bxf3,Rxg3+ 28.Bg2,d3+ Kh1 and I  have been analyzing this a lot, I believe that black has the best chance, but it is not without chances for white.} dxc3 23. Qxc3 {Big mistake - He had to play 23.Qc1 and I would continue with Nd4 and I believe that black has a nice game, but still a long way to the win.} Rd3 {White resigned, it would continue with 24.Qe1,Rdxg3 and white can not defend himself angainst a loosing too many pices and he will still have a loosing position. }
