1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bxf6 Qxf6 8. Nd5 Qd8 {The starting position for all the games.} 9. c3 Ne7 10. d4 {The point of the variation: if Black now exchanges Pawns, White is left with an "ideal center".} Nxd5 11. dxc5 Nf4 12. g3 Ne6 13. cxd6 {If Black now replies PxP I can use the half open Q file to pressure the backward QP.} Qxd6 14. Qxd6 {A Queen exchange first.} cxd6 15. O-O-O {With the Queens gone, I'm not afraid to leave my King in a relatively open area.} Ke7 16. Rhe1 {Securely guarding the KP.} Rd8 17. Bb3 {I don't want my B to remain loose, plus I add protection to the QR in case of a potential future exchange.} b5 18. Kb1 {The struggle for a tempo. Neither side can do a whole lot that is productive, and I start thinking in terms of a draw.} Bb7 19. Bc2 {Adding a guard to the KP.} Rac8 20. h4 {Preventing a potential K-side surge. To use a Niemzowitschian phrase, i'm reducing the game's dynamism.} a5 21. Nd2 {Clearing a space, eventually, for my KB pawn to secure the K pawn.} f6 22. Nf1 {Opening the line back up to keep the pressure on the Q pawn.} Rc4 23. Re3 {Guarding the KB3 square...} Rdc8 24. f3 {...so that I can finally secure my KP solidly.} b4 25. Rdd3 {Starting to wind the game down.} Nc5 26. Rd1 {Discretion is the only part of valor here.} bxc3 27. Rxc3 {Offering to drain more energy out of the game...} Rxc3 28. bxc3 {...with this Rook exchange.} Ba6 29. Ka1 {Moving off the open file.} Nd7 30. Bd3 {Draw agreed. After 30...BxB 31 RxB the QBP is guarded and the Rook and Knight ending offers no real winning chances to either side.}
