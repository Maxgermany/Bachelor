1. h3 {here it goes} h6 2. g4 g5 {copy cat} 3. f4 f5 {this game has one weird opening.} 4. Nf3 {here comes the knight.} Rh7 {For once black decides to think for themselves and do a move that does not involve copying.} 5. d4 {could have been called the queen's gambit if it had been the first move rather than the fifth.} Bg7 {Black's going for the attack.} 6. e3 {white seem to be developing their pieces.} Kf7 {what on earth is the king doing coming out.} 7.
