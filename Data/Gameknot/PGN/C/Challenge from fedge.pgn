[Opening "Queen's Gambit (D06)"]

1. d4 {Queen's pawn. One of my favorite openings. It usually leads to expansive and open games (which I tend to loose, but still enjoy)} d5 {Nothing strange, he replies in kind.} 2. c4 {Queen's gambit. I love this opening, for if he accepts the gambit by playing dxe4, I'll reply with e5, immediately opting for control of the center squares and attacking his c-file isolated pawn.} Be6 {Then he plays a strange move. Mistake by my calculation. This move is also not in the GK database. This move protects the d-pawn but it impairs development. The e-file pawn cannot advance and the dark square bishop (DSB) is blocked in.  e6 would be better do decline the gambit.} 3. Nc3 {Developing the queen's side pieces, re-enforcing my control of the center while attacking d5.} c6 {Protecting the d-pawn.  Another mistake, as this reduces developing options for the knight on b8.} 4. Nf3 {Developing.}
