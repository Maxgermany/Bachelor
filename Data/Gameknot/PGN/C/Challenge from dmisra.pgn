1. e4 {Let the guy castle and then attack his kingside- more entertainment than education. Blitzkrieg- works some times. The key was sacrificing a pawn to get his strong defensive bishop. Josep and I have had some good games. Enjoy.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bc4 {routine} Be7 5. d3 O-O {he castles- i am in a dangerous mood. Plan to attack his kingside- fasten your seat belts.} 6. Be3 Bg4 7. h3 Bh5 8. g4 {pawn storm- my intentions are revealed} Bg6 {could still end in grief for me} 9. g5 Nfd7 10. Nh4 {this is the key move for me- i could have advanced my h pawn to protect my g pawn but his bishop on g row was too strong for me} Bxg5 {pawn sacrifice} 11. Nxg6 {he has to take it with the h pawn} hxg6 {now to advance the h pawn} 12. Qd2 Bxe3 13. Qxe3 a6 14. h4 {up up} Nc6 15. h5 gxh5 16. Rxh5 Nd4 17. O-O-O b5 {no problem, coz my d-rook will go to h1} 18. Rdh1 {i dont get the q over to the h row yet, better to advance the 2 rooks right down the h file and the q will come in later} g6 19. Rh5h8+ Kg7 20. Rh1h7+ {next my knight will go to f6, he will go to e6, my queen will come to h3 etc. he resigns.}
