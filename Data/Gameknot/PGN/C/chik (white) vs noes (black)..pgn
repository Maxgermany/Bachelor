1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 {a very aggressive opening, I was wondering what the plan was} d5 3. Qxe5+ Ne7 4. exd5 Qxd5 {beat agression with agression ;)} 5. Qxc7 {As I mentioned him really liking my pawns..} Na6 6. Bxa6 {my opponent pointed out he also quite liked horses.} Qxg2 {Luckily enough, I always enjoy those rooks!} 7. d3 Qxh1 8. Bb5+ Nc6 9. Kf1 Bh3+ 10. Ke2 Bg4+ 11. Kf1 Rc8 12. Bxc6+ Qxc6 13. Qxc6+ Rxc6 {the swap.. the almighty swap!!} 14. Nc3 {As of this point, I started to almost dislike the game, since my chances are failing.} Bc5 15. Ne4 O-O 16. Ne2 {apparently, no swaps no more!} Re8 {putting some pressure on the horses.} 17. Bf4 {freeing the rook?} Rg6 {just to build up the heat. The bishop at c5 is covered by Ne4×Bc5, Re8×Ne2 (covered by Bg4).} 18. Re1 Bh3# {A slightly disappointing, but very relieving end of this good and somewhat scary game. }
