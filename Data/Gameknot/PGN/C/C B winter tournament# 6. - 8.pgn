1. Nf3 e6 2. c4 {English? French? } a6 3. Nc3 {Develop. Ns before Bs. } c6 {Why? ...Nc6 is better. several moves are better. } 4. g3 {d4 and e4 are stronger. this cannot be best, but is the fianchetto is not a bad formation. just not aggressive, which would be called for by Black's first 3 moves. } h6 {NOT yet needed in this position. The Black formation is screaming for ...d5. } 5. Bg2 Bd6 {again: ...d5 is better and is good preparation for ...Bd6.} 6. O-O Nf6 7. d3 g5 {both ...Bc7 and ...Be7 are better as they make ...d5 possible. this weakens the hiding place for Black's King. White has no weaknesses to call for this type of aggression. } 8. Re1 Qe7 {...Bc7 is better, permitting ...d6 as a response to e4. } 9. e4 Bb4 10. Bd2 {10.e5 is better, then ...Nh7, 11.d4 and white has good center control. } b5 11. a3 {wrong. 11.e5 is necessary. forces the N away from the center. } Ba5 12. b4 {Again: 12.e5 is necessary, then 13.Ne4 threatens Nd6+} Bc7 13. e5 Nh5 {...Nh7 appears better. } 14. Ne2 {cxb5 and Nd4 are both better. } Bb6 {14....cxd4 15.dxc g4 is better than ...Bb6. moving same piece too many times. However, after the current move (...Bb6), Black would be in a world of hurt. as following ...Bb6, white's c5 and d4 will lock in 4 of black's pieces for a loooong time. } 15. c5 Bc7 16. d4 O-O 17. Qc2 f6 {WHY!  ...f5 is significantly better. and blocks the Q's access to g6... ...Ng7 is better than ...f6} 18. Qg6+ Ng7 19. Qxh6 Rf7 20. exf6 Qxf6 21. Bxg5 Qxh6 22. Bxh6 Nf5 23. Bf4 {While this move is NOT bad as it get's rid of one of the pieces that can move, Bd2 is objectively stronger. } Bd8 24. Bg5 {both h4 and Ne5 are both stronger moves. } Bxg5 25. Nxg5 Rg7 26. Nf3 {h4  is stronger. and starts the distant passer towards the 8th rank. } Nh6 {...a5 is better, though Black is in a tough situation. } 27. Nf4 {a4 is to be considered. but this is one of White's good moves. threatening Ne5, Nh5 and Nf6+ followed by Ne8 and Nd6 locking up the Qside... } a5 28. bxa5 Rxa5 29. Re5 b4 30. Nh4 {30.a4 is better. } Ng4 {30....Na6 better. but White has tremendous pressure and a command of the board. } 31. Nh5 {31.Re2 is much better. 31.Nh5 deserves "??" as it gives away all White's advantages. } Nxe5 32. Nxg7 Nc4 {32....Kxg7 is about even. the bishop will come to a6 and move out, followed by ...Na6 and also departure. } 33. Ne8 b3 {33....Bxa3 is better. and becomes a protected OUTSIDE / DISTANT passed pawn. } 34. Be4 Na6 35. Nd6 Nd2 {...Nxd6 is better. Now the N appears to be trapped. } 36. Nxc8 {36.Bd3 is a "Must Move." and traps the Black N.} Nxe4 37. Ne7+ Kf7 38. Neg6 Nb4 39. Ne5+ Ke7 40. Re1 {40.Rb1 is stronger.} b2 {40....Nc2 is stronger.  forking R and d4 button... } 41. Rb1 Rxa3 42. Rxb2 Nd3 43. Rb7 {43.Nhg6+ better. } Nxe5 44. dxe5 Nxc5 45. Rb8 Kf7 46. Kg2 {47.f4 is better.} Ra5 47. Rb4 Nd3 48. Re4 Ra2 49. Rd4 {g4 is better. } Rxf2+ {...Nxe5 is stronger.} 50. Kh3 {50.Kg1 is better, saving the e5 button for a while. } Nxe5 51. Re4 Kf6 {black is strong, here. White's combination coming up guarantees that he will lose to the distant protected passer on c6. } 52. Rf4+ Rxf4 53. gxf4 Ng6 54. Nxg6 Kxg6 55. Kg4 c5 56. Kf3 Kf5 57. Ke3 d5 58. h4 Kg4 {}
