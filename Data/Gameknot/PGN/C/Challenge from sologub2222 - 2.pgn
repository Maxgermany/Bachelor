1. e4 {I started out with the common opening.} c6 2. Nc3 d5 { I hate d5, because it forces me to take action in the middle squares where I at this early in the game like to be kept alone. Nope.} 3. Qf3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 {I did that for a possoble N-G5, then QxF7, but I guess he would notice this.} e6 {He did.} 5. Qh5 Nf6 {with that king of a double attack, I either have to move my queen to protect the knight, or as usuall, kill it} 6. Nxf6+ Qxf6 7. d3 Nd7 8. Nf3 g6 9. Qa5 {5 was a wide open rank that I took advantage of, and now keeps me offensive.} Bg7 {He always finds a version somehow similar to the fiancetto.} 10. Qa3 {that move I doubted. As I said, I was trying to keep a small offensive possition, but I backed off.} Ne5 11. Qd6 {I tried to keep an advantage, and LOOK offensive, but that hurt me because the action got farther away from my queen.} Nxf3+ {Here's where he took the lead.} 12. gxf3 Qxf3 13. Bd2 {WHITE BLOOPERS. I immediately realized I had lost the advantage.} Qxh1 14. Bb4 {I was hoping that a queen and a bishop pointing at E7 woulda been mate in one, but the chances that I would succeed where 0.} Bf8 {See.} 15. Qd4 {This move, I was not looking at the attack back at b4, but H8- his rook.} Bxb4+ 16. Qxb4 {I noticed then that it was a check, and I needed to go for the bishop, not my target, the rook.} Qd5 17. O-O-O {At this point, I woulda thought xA2 would of been better but surprisingly his move appeared to be  his seccond choice in my mind, but he tried it anyways.} Qg5+ 18. Kb1 {I now think a better move would of been F4.} Qe7 {That was smart  of him.} 19. Qxe7+ {And risky of me} Kxe7 {For it only being move 19, we're cutting down pieces pretty fast. Can't let him get ahead of me.} 20. b3 {now hat I'm a rook behind, I can't risk getting trapped in.} e5 21. Re1 f6 22. Bg2 Kf7 23. Kb2 {In fact, I might not waste time to that move.} Be6 24. Re3 Bd5 {He's aloud to trade down now that he's ahead in points and possition, but i'm not. I consittered this for a moment, but I soon decided that I should keep what is left of me for the end game.} 25. Bh3 Rae8 26. Bd7 {I wasn't planning on this being a strong attack, but what do I have to do, I mean, I can't make it through his strong pawn positioning.} Re7 27. Bh3 {I retreat.} f5 {His pawn structure is even stronger now, and I'm completely trapped until he takes advantage of his major pieces, and gets in by me, but I think he's thinking the exact same thing, because it doesn't take him long to get out of there.} 28. Kb1 e4 29. dxe4 Rxe4 {Again, he is trying to  get down piecess for him to get even more of an advantage.} 30. Rd3 Re2 {He broke through and now he is going for the pieces least important to me but defenseless agains his piecess. My pawns.} 31. Kb2 Rhe8 32. Re3 {here he took the advantage.} Re2xe3 33. fxe3 Rxe3 34. Bf1 {The only safe place.} f4 {I suddenly knew he was heading towards permotion. I needed to stop him, but I was very far behind in position. I couln't. } 35. h4 f3 36. a4 f2 {Now we took action. I played it out just a bit longer, but I couldn't hold him off.} 37. Ka2 Re1 38. Bd3 Be4 39. Bc4+ Kf6 40. Ka3 Bf3 {I had no choice. His best phrase was, resignation is always an option, and I knew it was to.} 41. Bd3 Be2 {Whit resighned, black won, and I let go of my breathe. Unrated, so the rating did not change, but this was all over, and I still did not beat sologub.}
