[Opening "King's pawn game (C44)"]

1. e4 {Ah, a kings pawn game.  I think I'll just play it boringly for the first few moves.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. b3 {Here it starts to get different. Looks like Dad is planning to fianchetto his bishop. I want to try to keep the middle full of pawns to block it in.  } Nf6 {I wanted to play Bc5 to get the bishop out and then play d6 to make my centre pawns strong... but I decided on just developing for now.} 4. Bd3 Bc5 5. O-O {After castling, his pawn on f2 is pinned.} d6 {Opening up my white bishop, and strengthening my e5 pawn.} 6. h3 Be6 7. Bb2 Qd7 8. Nc3 Bxh3 {Offering to sacrifice my bishop. My queen will be following in behind it.} 9. Nxe5 {Feels like a gift.  My king and queen are lined up, and Dad has a white bishop handy to skewer them if I capture it with my knight. But, I do so anyway, because if I play my pawn to c6 then that should deal with the bishop.} Nxe5 10. gxh3 Qxh3 11. Be2 Nfg4 {Things are looking very poorly for white.  As far as I can tell, the only way to prevent Qh2# is to trade out both his white bishop and queen.}
