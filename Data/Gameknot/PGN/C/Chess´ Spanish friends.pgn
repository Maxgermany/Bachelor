1. e4 {So here is my second Annotation. I was taught by myself therefore I do not know the chess language and the openings people use, but I'm sure I have a fair Idea of what I'm doing.  I am very lucky to not have lost this game, as you will find out in the latter half on this annotated game.  But onwards to the game at hand. White starts with the kings pawn opening very standard opening play by most players, although I do believe when you start to play the 1700s+ d4 is commonly used along with c4, Nc3, Nf3 etc.   I am not a fan of the e4 opening and not sure why I've played this, it's the first time I have ever played e4 in any of my chess games on Gameknot. I must have not been paying attention.} c5 {I don't like playing off the lines and never like to play the Sicilian as I do not know it, I have never studied it due to the fact I don't play e4.} 2. Nf3 {Saying as I don't have much of an idea of how to play against the Sicilian I just play a safe move of Nc6 and try and keep things steady as possible and not make any mistakes. As I recall the Sicilian doesn't have many gambits if any at all so I can cope well enough.} d6 3. Nc3 {From this move onwards Nc3 there is no main line} Nc6 {Nc6} 4. Bb5 {Here I am not sure whether it was the best move, I felt I wanted to develop my Bishop instead of playing d3, of course if my opponent decides to play a6 then I am forced to trade off as Ba4 will lose my bishop for 2 pawns.} Bd7 {Bd7, which I believe was so my opponent wouldn't have doubled pawns on the c file, which in most cases isn't bad to have. I would have forced the Bishop/Knight trade-off as I like have doubled pawns on the c or f files.} 5. O-O {0-0 let's get the king safe first and foremost, never wait to castle king unless you have a very good attack going.} Nf6 {Nf6} 6. d3 {d3 was used to develop my Bishop and protect e4 from attacks further down the line.} g6 {g6, something about this move seems too passive I would have played e5 possibly but that just seems to be the English opening as black, everyone has different ways to play and maybe e5 would of blocked in the bishop. So playing g6 was to release his f7 Bishop.} 7. Bxc6 {Sooner or later it was going to happen Bxc6, I never really strategize throughout this match, this is probably mainly the reason I only got a draw. I tend to try and win the end-games rather than the middle game. } Bxc6 {Bxc6} 8. b3 {What a pointless move on my part, the Bc1 already has the ability to be developed playing Bb2 does nothing but weaken my Nc3 because Bg7 by black already covers the pin on Nf6 and castling the move after effectively ruins the point of Bb2.} Bg7 {Bg7 as expected} 9. Bb2 {Bb2} O-O {0-0} 10. e5 {Now I felt it was time to attack no point playing passively.   Black has two options here play dxe5 or Bxf3 but doing so would result in the loss of b7 for double pawns on e5. Then again white could move his knight if he wanted to go defensive.} dxe5 {dxe5 didn't expect anything else.} 11. Nxe5 {Nxe5} Rc8 {Rc8 merely to stop having double pawns on the c file at this point most likely would of been costly} 12. Nxc6 {Nxc6 } Rxc6 {Rxc6} 13. Re1 {Re1 As I pointed out before I never really put much strategy into this game was moving pieces to where it seemed good.} Re8 {Follows up with Re7} 14. Rb1 {I intended to move my knight to e4 to trade off and not lose my Bishop in the process} Qc7 {Qc7} 15. Ne4 {Ne4 as I wanted.} Rd8 {Why he plays Rd8 I'm not quite sure, I think the most obvious move is double up his f pawns by taking with knight and Bishop if I must leaves my rook with the open e file which could help.} 16. Qf3 {But why I play Qf3 is beyond me, hoping my opponent makes a mistake, it was a dumb move on my part and almost landed me in trouble if I made the wrong move.} Nxe4 {Nxe4 which I believe should of happened last move} 17. dxe4 {The reason behind dxe4 was because, if Queen took on e4, then Bxb2, Rxb2, Re6 and I lose the queen and the game is over... Rxe4 may have been better, but when you aren't playing well everything seems to go wrong.} Bxb2 {Bxb2 as expected} 18. Rxb2 {Rxb2} Rf6 {Rf6} 19. Qe3 {Qe3} Qe5 {now the attack by black comes, I can't defend with f3 because of my rook on b2 so f3 is delayed by a move or two} 20. c3 {c3 was to prevent Rd4} b6 {b6} 21. Rd2 {was thinking time to try and close out the game with as little material as possible, usually my end-games are pretty good comapred to what I have played so far. } Rxd2 {Rxd2} 22. Qxd2 {Qxd2} Rd6 {Rd6} 23. Qe3 {Qd3} Rd8 {Rd8??} 24. f4 {f4 was to merely get rid of his Queen which seemed to be quite active in the centre of the board} Qd6 {Qd5} 25. Kf2 {To prevent Qd2 I suppose...} e6 26. c4 Kf8 27. e5 {e6-c4-Kf8-e5} Qe7 28. Re2 Kg7 {e6-c4-Kf8-e5-Qe7-Re2-Kg6  } 29. Rd2 {From here I thought I had the upper hand even if it's only slightly his king is at g6 and I have an e5 pawn which is quite advanced, so getting rooks off may help my cause to win.} Qh4+ {I couldn't have played g3 as my h2 pawn would of been under threat and the game would of been hard to recover as it's the end game.} 30. Kg1 {Kg1 seemed the only choice available.} Rxd2 {Rxd2 I expected and liked because now my queen has the only open file available which should come in my favour.} 31. Qxd2 {Qxd2} Qe7 {Qe7 not sure if it was the best move, yes he is trying to prevent my Queen on d2 to move to d7 but I feel he could of delayed it for a move to see if I made the move on Qd7 and he would of had checkmate on e1.} 32. Qd6 {But the mistake that should have lost me the game right here. I was sure in my head that his king on g7 couldn't get back in time before I promoted but how wrong was I, it should have lost me the game, but luck was on my side that day.} Qxd6 {Qxd6, exd5} 33. exd6 Kf8 {Kf8, now the push to d7 isn't available, was so close to resigning this game as my opponent takes 3-4 days to move I felt there was no point prolonging this game much longer as I will lose.} 34. Kf2 {But inevitably I decided to play on, I knew a win was now out of reach but maybe I could scrape a draw if my opponent made a blunder.} Ke8 {Ke8 the pawn on d6 is effectively his now.} 35. Ke3 Kd7 36. Ke4 Kxd6 {Ke3, Kd7, Ke4, Kxd5.  } 37. g4 {Now all black has to do is get a pass pawn in this situation and the game is his, in this position it would be easy after g4, f5 would of been best to do} a6 {a6?? Not sure maybe it was to try and push b6-b5 waste of a move in my opinion} 38. a4 {Must follow up with a4 otherwise the game is lost.} f6 {Why Black doesn't play f5 I am not sure, I was analyzing every move from move 33 looking at different combinations everything I could to try and get that vital draw. As this is a tournament match where I am leading. If I lost it means I would have to beat Thesceptic in my final game to win the tournament but could only win it by tying first, if TheSceptic wins the remainder of his games.   1. blackie_chan-5.5/1 game remaining 2. dgalonso_23-4/0 games remaining 3. thesceptic-3.5/3 games reamining 4. daaron-2/1 game remaining 5. brianthomson-2/1 game remaining} 39. h4 {h4 just to try and get my pawns set up where neither king can pass the enemy line, I believe f4 was still available here} h6 {h6?? It looks as if my opponent has no desire to win and not wanting to take chances. If I was him I'd have attacked to win, which in my opinion I believe I would have succeeded easily enough.} 40. Ke3 {to stop the check on f5 and if my opponent decided to play it, I would follow up with g5} e5 {Now this game is a draw I think after e5} 41. f5 {Black has no options but to take or push to g4} gxf5 {gxf5 followed up by gxf5, now the kings can't get past either's defence so it's a draw.} 42. gxf5 {:)} h5 43. Ke4 {h5, Ke4. I offered draw at this stage because it was, Kc6 didn't work because I reply with Kd3, and if he plays b5 I play a5 and from there it's a draw. Maybe my opponent could of played on for the next few moves then accepted my draw it was worth a try after all he couldn't lose in this position. If you are in a winning position play it out until it's a draw you never know your opponent may make the mistake which costs him the game :)  If anyone has any views or comments you can tell me where I have gone wrong and explain to me.   Comments are always welcome :)  }
