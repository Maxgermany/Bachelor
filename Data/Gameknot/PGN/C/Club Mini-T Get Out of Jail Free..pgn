1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5 {Queen's Pawn Counter-Gambit.  Many authors of opening books will deride this opening, almost as if playing it were a criminal offence.  Well, I found myself on death row at that, before the reprieve came.  It is true the line is very risky, possibly even unsound.  But GM Paul Keres used to recommend this line for developing players in order to exercise the (tactical) imagination.  Every now and then I like to try it on for a tactical blow-out.  Boy, did I get what I asked for!} 3. exd5 {Probably the most popular response, and a perfectly good one.  Also playable (and good) are 3.Nxe5, and 3.d4!?} Bd6 {This would have been my response to 3.Nxd5 as well.  The bishop is well placed, here, for aggression as well as for defence.} 4. d4 {Good move, placing Black's centre under early pressure.} e4 {A glance at the Gameknot (GK) World dataBase indicates that no other move really comes into consideration here.  It will also tell you that Black's record ain't too flash: Win 7, Draw 10, Lose 28.} 5. Nfd2 {Out of the GK World dataBase.  Far more usual is 5.Ne5, to which Black most often responds 5...Nf6.} f5 {Into the unknown.  White's 5th has been played 9 times on the GK Site dataBase, for 5 wins to 4 - no draws!  But no one played 5...f5, preferring instead 5...Nf6.  But I wanted to get this pawn move in before developing the Knight.  Possibly I was taking more of a risk than I thought!} 6. Bb5+ Bd7 {Thematic check and response.  Yet I now wonder whether I ought to have given ...c6 more attention.  Note, by the way, that the doubled d-pawns are a bit of a nuisance for Black, by interfering with his Q-side development.} 7. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {(?!) Probably 7...Nxd7 ought after all to have been preferred here.  That knight was to prove hard to get moving subsequently, and even then sat out the war on a3, 'awaiting orders'.} 8. c4 {White has obtained a powerful grip on most of the centre and Q-side.} Nf6 9. O-O c5 {(?!) According to the GK engine, an inaccuracy.  Now was the time to develop the knight to a6.  I was hoping for 9...dxc6 e.p. Nxc6, but expected 9.dxc5 Bxc5, which I thought was OK for Black.} 10. f3 {(?!)  My first reaction to this was 'ah, mistake', a view endorsed by the post-game GK analysis.  Yet upon examining the position more closely, I came to modify my view.  Black is not having nearly as much fun as I anticipated.  Still, the expected 10.dxc5 Bxc5  11.Nb3 looks good for White.} cxd4 {Best.  Black is committed to advancing his centre pawns and hope they have enough strength and resilience to offset the pressure White will soon develop right across the board.} 11. fxe4 fxe4 {It has to be admitted that Black's pair of centre pawns look formidable, but they prove hard to support in their advanced position, with no pawns on either side of them.  Aron Nimzovitch used to call such a pair a 'hanging pawn couple'.  Their future is certainly suspenseful!} 12. Nb3 d3 {Forced, worse luck, as the only defence this pawn could obtain was from its colleague.  But this gives White use of the centre dark squares.  At this point, the GK engine calls it +0.32 (I'll give pluses for White's favour, minuses for Black), but I reckon White is doing better than that!} 13. Bg5 {(+0.48)  A good development.  Black will scarcely want to weaken his K-side by ...h6.  Eh...?  Yes, well, we'll see about that...} O-O {(+0.69)} 14. Nc3 {(+1.05) Quick, sensible development by White.  Note how the GK engine scores are trending: upwards, and in significant increments.  That is not a good augury for Black's future prospects!} Re8 {(!) A difficult, cold-blooded decision, with a generous side order of desperation.  Yes, it had so quickly come to that. Although it might not look so bad, I was already hanging on by my teeth.  Everything depended upon maintaining those advanced pawns, and hope that eventually the threat of promotion might yet save the game for Black.  This was the only way to defend them, but the price comes high!} 15. Bxf6 gxf6 16. Rxf6 {White has won a pawn, and almost laid bare the Black King.  Now, when under a flank attack, often the best defence is counter-action in the centre,  That was where I pinned my hopes in this game.} Kg7 {(??)  A disastrous move, and it is probably just as well I didn't spot the refutation during the game.  I thought this was the only move to save the game!  Better would have been 16...Na6, but I had already determined that Black got a miserable game after that: 16...Na6  17.Re6 Rxe6  18.Qg4ch and Black will soon drop a second pawn.} 17. Qf1 {(?!)  This was the move I expected.  In fact, so logical does it look, the move 17.Qh5!! never even occurred to me.  Had it done so, I would have chosen a different 16th move: 17.Qh5 and now [a] 17...Kxf6  18.Qh6ch!! Ke7  19.Qg5ch! Kf7  20.Rf1ch and wins; [b] 19...Be5  20.Ne4 Bxf6  21.Nxf6 Kxf6  22.Kxf6 Nc5 and the Black King can not survive the crossfire of White's pieces and pawns.  This has to count as a monumental piece of luck for me. } Na6 {"It's now or never..." Elvis Presley...} 18. Nb5 {(!?) The GK engine calls the game even, here, but I didn't feel that I was out of the woods yet.  Instead, 18.Nd4 Bc5  19.Qf2 e3  20.Qg3ch Kh8  21.Ne6 d2 and battle rages on, but Black still looks to have his back to the wall.  Even if this were not the best play from White, Black had to do something for his bishop...} Be5 {Driving back the rook.  The attack against b2 is incidental and irrelevant.} 19. Rf5 {(!) Finding another active posting.  Man this was tough going.} h6 {A horrible move to contemplate, yet it seemed just about essential, to prevent Rg5ch.  It is also no indication that Black's game might anything approaching equality with White.} 20. Re1 {White brings up his last reserves.  About what I expected.  Black has an exposed King, advanced but vulnerable centre pawns almost surrounded by the enemy, and a knight twiddling its thumbs in a remote desolate spot.  } Rac8 {Also mobilising the last reserves, in the hope that the resulting clash might yet fall out in my favour.  Compared with the overall menace in White's position, this attack against c4 doesn't amount to much.  But there was one small tactical feature that I had already observed...} 21. Rxe4 {(?!) To be honest I hoped, but didn't really expect, White to play this.  Black's response is so obvious.  But once more, a closer examination indicated this wasn't as bad as the sequel would seem to indicate.  I was expecting 21.Nd4 or Nd2 here.} Bxh2+ {The good old masked battery motif strikes again.  As the game progressed, though, I wondered if after all White had seen this, and had a cunning plan in mind.} 22. Kxh2 Rxe4 {Having won the exchange for a pawn, Black has roughly an equal game, White being compensated for the slight material deficit with more space and better placed pieces. But now...} 23. Nd6 {(??) This came like the sun bursting through clouds, as after this Black is well on top.  Instead, 23.Nd2 blockades the d-pawn and attacked the rook.  But see the comment.  I don't really trust the GK engine's analysis for reasons you will see there. } Qxd6+ {Had White overlooked the simple loss of the piece, the check .... or something else?} 24. g3 {(?) GK calls this a mistake, too, but as 24.Kg1 Qb6ch led to the exchange of Queens, White already down a rook suggests the King retreat was not an option.} Re2+ {The GK engine prefers ...Qg6, but I was looking for simple lines.} 25. Kh3 {Forced.} Re3 {Dual purpose: protecting the d-pawn and threatening mate.} 26. Rf7+ {I had been expecting Qf2 or maybe Qg1.} Kg8 {It was here that I wondered whether this whole sequence had been planned by White with the idea 26...Kg6?? 27.Qf5#!  But after this retreat, White has run out of attack.} 27. Rf3 {Defending the rook and averting the mate.  } Rf8 {Simpler to my mind than ...Qd7ch, the GK engine's recommendation.} 28. Rxf8+ Qxf8 29. Qg2 {Relatively best was 29.Qxf8ch, but a rook down so late in the endgame is simply prospectless.  Better to keep the Queen the better to exploit any mistake Black might yet come up with.} Qf5+ 30. Kh2 Qh5+ 31. Kg1 Re1+ 32. Kf2 {Cutting short the chase.  After 32.Qf1 Rxf1ch  33.Kxf1 Qe2ch 34.Kg1 Qxb2 and mate is not far off...} Qe2# {That was one lucky escape for Black, and maybe a tantalising might-have-been for White.}
