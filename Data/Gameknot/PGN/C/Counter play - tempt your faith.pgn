1. d4 {This game was my 9th here at a rating of around 1500 just like my opponent. Like it happens in my games rather often, this was not won by me.. but lost by my precious opponent. He played well and brave but made two unfortunate passive moves backwards when the counter-play should have taken place.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6 5. Bd2 Nbd7 {So far nothing new under the sun. A variation of the Semi-Slav played by many Grand Masters in the 90s but more or less disappeared in the new millenium. White is ahead in development while Black gained a small run in creating outposts and building an attack.} 6. f4 {Unusual move and in my opinion slightly inaccurate as well. Prevents the advance of Black's e-pawn, keeps a close eye on a centre square, but sadly enough gives away the adventage White had in development and what is most important (and it is going to turn out within two more moves) weakens the e4 square, the one Black was racing for to make an outpost there.} Nb6 {This is a bluffy threat. 6... Ne4 7.Nf3 (rushing to f7 via g5) 7... Be7 (preventing it and getting closer to castle) 8.Bd3 (attacking the e4 knight) 8... f5 (defending it) 9.0-0 0-0 10.Rc1 (occupying the most probably opening c-file) 10... Ndf6 is the logical line I think. Let us face it, at analyzis time it is always easier to find the proper moves :-)} 7. b3 {7.c5! would have pointed out my lack of caution immediately and I would have had no choice but to go back to d7 wasting time.} Ne4 {The outpost has been created.} 8. Nf3 {The king-knight threateningly appears on the battlefield.... and... and...} Nxd2 {... and an outburst again.. bad habbit of mine, I have to confess. 8... Be7 preventing the bright knight from going to g5 and getting ahead both in development and in securing His Highness was the cool and cautions continuation. Exchanging a precious outpost for a bishop that has no use for a long while is a damn waste!!} 9. Qxd2 dxc4 10. Bxc4 {I would have taken back with the b-pawn strengthening the centre and creating a good pawn-chain moreover a clear half open b-file for the queen-rook. Taking with the bishop has a clear adventage though, it gives way for castling. In spite of the fact I would have taken with the b-pawn I am not entirely sure that was any better.} Bb4 11. O-O Nd5 {Helping the b4 bishop in attacking the c3 knight.} 12. Bxd5 exd5 {It is clear now that the big fight will take place on the queen-side. The king is safe after castling so it was better to take with the e-pawn than taking towards the centre (never follow the principles blindly).} 13. a3 Be7 {Felt a bit behind so decided to try and simplify the board in a better position.} 14. b4 O-O 15. Ne5 {Good outpost but it means no immeadiate or concrete threat for the moment.} Bf5 16. Rae1 {Maybe 16.g4 Bc8 17.Qg2 was slightly better. This rook move prepared the advance of the e-pawn but with loosing a tempo.} a5 {One of the white knights is far away and even Her Majesty is a bit off while the e7 bishop occupies the queen-side actions.. conclusion? It is high time to make some trouble on queen-side!!} 17. Na2 {16... a5 was a threat but not a solid one. A good counter attack with advancing the b-pawn could have pointed it out: 17.b5 f6 18.Nf3 Bxa3 19.bxc6! bxc6 and White has a good and solid pawn structure.. while that of Black is a mass!} f6 18. Nd3 axb4 19. Ndxb4 {The move that practically costed the game for White. Have given a great deal of thought to it, but honestly I still do not see what my opponend had in mind. He had played well so far so there must have been something there I am sure of it. Taking back with the other knight would have given a better counter play. The black pieces are better organized still and both bishops are active, but the position was far from decisive.} Rxa3 20. h3 Qa5 21. Rea1 Ra8 22. g4 Be4 23. Qb2 Bxb4 {All in all it was an exciting game for what I would like to thank for my opponent! Being a bit more aggressive probably the result would have been the opposite!}
