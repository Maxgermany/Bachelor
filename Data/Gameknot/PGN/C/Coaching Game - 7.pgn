[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {So, I decide to start with my usual King's Pawn Opening.  I told him that this was the most common opening.  Also common is 1.d4, also known as the Queen's Pawn Opening.  However, this is a little more common. I made this easy for my opponent to remember, by mentioning that GM Bobby Fisher would say, "Best by Test". } e5 {He responds with the King's Pawn Game.  I told him that this is standard.  Also standard and more standard is the Siclian Defense, 1.c5.  However, this is perfectly playable.} 2. Nf3 {So, I bring out my Knight.  What happened?  I told my opponent, that development is extremely important, in a chess game.  That one should get his pieces out, ASAP.  With that in mind, I also said that this was the cornerstone of development.  In addition, I noted that minor pieces (Knights and Bishops), should be developed before the major pieces (Rook and Queen).  In fact, the Queen should be the last thing that comes out.} d6 {He responds by bringing out his d pawn.  I was actually hoping that he would bring out his b8 Knight, so that I could play the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5).  However, because that did not happen, I have a different response.  What is it?  I also told him that this was not the best, as it crams his DSB.  So, he will have to waist time to bring it out, later on.  @flutie39: Better was 2...Nc6, or 2...Nf6, in this position.} 3. d4 {Oh yeah.  I told my opponent, that this is the response, to his last move.  How did I learn this?  It was actually from a previous annotation, by one of the commentators.  That annotation, however, involved my game against aluke42.  Later on, cdeburca told me that d4 is usually best in the beginning, if your opponent only advances one square.  The French Defense, is an example (1.e4, d6 2.d4.)  And, black was correct, about the logic behind this.  He guessed that it opened up other lines and variations, for an attack.  BTW, at this point, he thinks that I am a very good coach, and he is beginning to understand the positions extremely well.  That is one of my goals.  I want to get him familiar, so that he can study, analyze, and think about the positions.  This is something it takes to be a strong chess player.} a5 {I am not sure why he played this.  But, I told him that 3...exd4 is most common, in this position.  Then, white generally responds with 4.Nxe4, and everything is even, without weakening the position.  This, however, is not a great move because it loses his e5 pawn pawn, with 4.dxe5.  And, if white responds with 4...dxe5, 5.Qxd8, Kxd8, ultimately losing the chance to castle.  I mentioned, that castling is a very important aspect, as it protects the King, "Tucks the monarch away", as it is said.} 4. dxe5 b6 {! Of course, 4...Nc6 was also playable, but I told him that this move is solid.  Why?  In this position, he is prepared to develop his LSB.} 5. Nc3 {So, I develop my Knight, just in case he fianchetto's his LSB, to plan an attack, against my e4 pawn.} Na6 {He decides on this move.  Best, however, was 5...Nc6, as it is still a developing move (a move that also continues with development.  I explained that concept to him and the fact that a Knight on a rim is grim.  Why?  It generally makes a knight vulnerable to attack, gives it less room to escape from danger, and reduces it's value (makes it worth less).} 6. Bc4 {In the meantime, I am still determined to castle, so I decide to continue with development.  This move also pins his f7 pawn, and he cannot attack my LSB, as it is protected by that piece, and my e4 pawn.  As I explained to him, it is extremely important to develop all of your pieces, in a chess game.} Nc5 {So, he is still determined to attack the pawn and bring his Knight on the right square.  I told him that this is where the Knight should be, but that previous move caused him to move it twice.  I mentioned that you generally should not move the same piece twice, during the beginning.  Why?  It takes away development because you're busy moving that piece multiple times, instead of, developing.  I told him the same thing that schakertjie told me, in a different annotation.  What is it?  "Your main goal should be to develop, develop, develop".  } 7. O-O {In the meantime, I do not waste time to castle.} Nxe4 {?? He thought that this move would win a free pawn.  This, however, is his first serious mistake.  Why?  As a direct result, I will take back and win his Knight, in return.  Therefore, he just gave up away piece, for a pawn.  Master elyhim has told me, "exchange pawns, not pieces."   After this move, my opponent said, "Protected I think I meant the king, your king is now protected in the corner Damn, I totally missed that I was jeopardizing my knight for your pawn...an error, for sure."  Then, I told him that the King was protected, and that is why one should castle early and often.  I also told him the definition of general principles.  That General Opening Priniciples=guidelines to help you in the opening.  I told him that one of those guidelines was not moving the same piece twice.  Afterall, I am little more developed, so I am also a little more prepared and ready, as we will see later on.  He said, "Great Advice".   } 8. Nxe4 Nh6 {So, he places his Knight on the rim.  In this case, however, I told him that a Knight on the rim is dim.  In other words, this is best, as 8...Ne7, blocks his Queen and DSB, for later on, and 8...Nf6 looses another Knight for a different pawn.  If he leaves it there, however, where is the development?  In other words, the Knight has to come out, somehow and someway.} 9. Bf4 {Now, I am thinking about another move, like Ng5, with one of my Knights, but I would like to prevent my Knight from traveling twice, at this point in time, to set a good example for my opponent.  I also think about playing Qd5, but don't as that would put my Queen in danger, and because of what I mentioned, in my last sentence.  Therefore, I bring out my other bishop.  As I told the opponent, this is part of getting all your pieces out.  This move, however, completely controls the center.  I also mentioned why we want to develop, in chess.  One of the goals is to control the center.} Ng4 {? I am not sure why he moved there.  However, he is still moving the same piece more then once, and I told him that this is another mistake.  Why?} 10. Nfg5 {!! Because of this.  BTW, this is where I told him, that it is ok to move the same piece more then once, after the center is controlled.  Now, if he takes my Knight, 11.Bxg5, so pieces are exchanged.  When you are behind, you generally don't want to exchange.  However, accepting an exchange is best, in this position, as we will see momentarily.  Therefore, this is a move that deserves two exclamation points as it is extraordinarily brilliant and very well spotted because of what I have, in store for him.  } Be7 {I understand this move very well.  He wants to castle and is a little worried that I might try to mate him.  However, that is not my intention, in this position.  With this move, I told him, that although exchanging is not usually a good idea, when you are down material, this is an exception.  I also could respond with 11.Nxe7, winning his h8 rook and f7 pawn.  However, 11.Bxf7+ is even better.  Why?  Taking with my Knight, would still give him a chance to castle Queenside, if he completes development.  Although I won't get nearly as much by taking with the bishop, this move loses a pawn and his opportunity to castle.  That is why 10.Nfg5!! was extraordinarily brilliant.  Because of this, his center is virtually destroyed, but I am almost completely developed.  } 11. Bxf7+ Kf8 12. Bd5 {So, I pull the bishop back.  Normally, I don't want my pieces to get attacked, as it wastes tempo.  However, this is an exception because of what I just outlined earlier.  Now, I have a winning edge, even though the game is not lost, for black.  Why?  Being a piece ahead is often the difference between a win and loss.} Ba6 {?? I'm not sure why he moved here, but this is his loosing blunder.  BTW, I told him that 12.Bb7 was better.  @flutie39: I apologize for that.  Why?  That would not have been any better.  As it turns out, 12...Qe8 was best, and still keeps you in the game.  It would have been the only way the protect the Queen and still loses a Rook.  As it turns out, however, this move loses his Queen and a8 Rook, for my g5 Knight, after 13.Ne6+.  That is because Ne6, forks the King and Queen, so black is forced to get himself out of check.  And, he cannot do this, with his Queen.  Then he asked, "And I should have been looking for vulnerability of my Queen..."  @flutie39: Yes.  It is always important to be aware of the dangers, that lie ahead. } 13. Ne6+ Ke8 14. Nxd8 Kxd8 15. Bxa8 Kd7 {?? In this position, he is trying to win my LSB.  However, as mentioned earlier, it is always important to see the threat.  @flutie39: This is a perfect example.  Having said that, this move is another big mistake, as it loses another piece and pawn, after placing him in check.} 16. Qxg4+ Ke8 17. Qxg7 Rf8 {Now, he is forced to protect his Rook.} 18. Bc6+ {Now, I am setting up a good attack against him, given that I am completely developed.  This is the cornerstone of the attack.} Kd8 19. Bg5 {So, I do not waste time to pin his DSB.  In fact, this move wins his bishop.  I took that into account, before making this move.} Kc8 20. Qxe7 Rg8 {?? I'm not sure, why he moved there, but I accurately told him that 20...Rh8 was best.  Then, he asked, "Why would Rh8 be better?"  As a result, I pointed out that anything else just loses the Rook.  Therefore, this move should have won his other rook.  However, I missed that opportunity, with my next move.  Note: Even coaches and/or mentors miss opportunities.  This happened in one of my games, against Jack Stockel.  After I missed a threat, he said that he could have taken a piece, but overlooked that opportunity.  In addition, if my opponents rook leaves the eighth rank, it's mate in one.  } 21. e6 {This is how I overlook my chance.  Instead, 21.Qe6+ should have been played.  That move would have forked his King and remaining Rook.  Then, this would have happened, 21...Kb8 (forced), 22.Qxg8+, so that he has to respond with Bc8, in order to avoid mate.  } d5 {So, he decides to attack my Knight.} 22. Nf6 {And, I respond by attacking his Rook.} Rxg5 {?? I understand why he made this move.  It wins a free piece, but as the master mater and Master elyhim would say, "To take is a mistake".  Having said that, this was a move that I did not expect.  Unlike most games, in a coaching game, I always hope that my opponent will make the best move, not the worst.  Having said that, I told my opponent that 22...Rh8 was best as it still protects his Rook and prevents what I am going to do next.  What is my intention?  This time, unlike move 21, I am not going to miss my opportunity, as I now have a mate in one, after 23.Qe8#.  } 23. Qe8# {BTW, I heard about flutie39, before this game from jstevens1.  As it turns out, he is also in the, "Walking the Walk and Learning How to Run", club.  Overall, he played extremely well but made two serious mistakes, that ended this game.  In fact, I believe that he played far north of his rating.  If I had to evaluate, I would say that he played more like a 950 rated player, then 825.  In general, however, you want to develop and get your pieces out, ASAP. The other thing is that you always want to be careful of your opponents intention.  Afterall, his or her plans are just as important as your own.  @flutie39: I believe that you are on a northward trend.  Therefore, if you can remember this game and the moral, it is extremely likely that your rating will reach 1000, within a year.  Note: I always have optimisim, and, "The glass is half full, not half empty", as they say.}
