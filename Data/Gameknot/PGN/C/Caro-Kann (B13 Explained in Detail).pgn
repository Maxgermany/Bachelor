1. e4 {Attack the centre and opens lines for queen and LSB } c6 {Attacks centre while opening lines for queen} 2. d4 {Again I attack centre while gaining space and opens c1-h6 diagonal for DSB} d5 {Black counters my strong centre} 3. exd5 {The idea behind this move is to latter used the e-file to attack and gain better control over e5-square.} cxd5 {Best move. Not 3..Qxd5 because of 4.Nc3(gaining tempo and attacking centre)} 4. c4 {Attacking centre and preparing Nc3 while opening d1-a4 diagonal for queen for activity.} Nf6 {Best move as it develops kindside and defend's d5 pawn. This move also helps black control centre square e4} 5. Nc3 {Applying more pressure on d5 and e4 square} Nc6 6. Nf3 Bg4 {Not the best. Stronger was Bf5 controling the b1-h7 diagonal, with the idea to trade off Light Square Bishops} 7. Be3 {Defending d4 pawn as black is applying lots of pressure on it(Nc6,Qd8 and Bg4 are all applying pressure on d4, Directly and Ndirectly).} e6 {Better than 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Bxf3 9.Qxf3 Nxd4 10.Bxd4 Qxd4 11.Bb5 Nf6 12.Qxb7 Rd8 13.Rd1 with a clear advantage} 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. Nxd5 {Bad move by me,As it helps blacks development. Better was 8.Bd3} Qxd5 {Advantage is now in blacks hands as he is ahead in development} 10. a3 {Only good move. If 10.Be2 then black just play 10..Bb4+ then I lose my castling move.} Bxf3 {Blacks lose now any advantage he had as he is preparing to trade off queens and give me the bishop pair in a very open endgame. I think better was 10.. Bd6} 11. Qxf3 Qxf3 12. gxf3 g6 {Bad move. All it does it not develop and weakens his black squares. Bd6 was better} 13. Bc4 Bg7 14. O-O-O Rc8 15. Kb1 O-O {In this position it can be seen that I have the better endgame simply because I have a bishop pair And I am not prepared to trade bsihops any time.} 16. d5 {Trying to get rid of my weak isolated pawn.} Ne5 17. Be2 exd5 18. Rxd5 a6 19. Rhd1 {Controling d-file and preparing to attack his Queenside pawns soon} Nc4 {Blunder,better was 19..Rfd8} 20. Bxc4 Rxc4 21. Bc5 {Winning move. If 21..Re8 then 22.R5d8 Rxd8 23.Rxd8 winning the bishop soon} Rxc5 22. Rxc5 Re8 23. Rc7 {Black Resgins as I clearly got a very easy endgame to win. Plz leave your comments and ask any questions.}
