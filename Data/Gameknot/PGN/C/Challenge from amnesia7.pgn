1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 {This is a very bad move because of the exposed kingside. Why not play nc6? } 3. Bc4 Bc5 {I was always taught knights before bishops but not everyone was.} 4. O-O d6 5. Nc3 Bg4 6. h3 {Pretty normal stuff} Bxf3 7. Qxf3 Ne7 {Another reason why f6 is a bad move} 8. d3 Nbc6 9. Bh6 {This may seem weird to you. That is because it is a very bad move at first sight but analyse deeper. Because of the weak f pawn  it's a interesting move.} gxh6 10. Qh5+ Ng6 11. Qxh6 Qe7 {Ohh bad move i'm going to kick it with the knight straight away} 12. Nd5 Qd8 13. Qg7 Bd4 {Very bad move. My opponent has analysed nothing at all} 14. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {The only move} 15. Qxf6 Rf8 16. Qg7 O-O-O 17. Be6+ {Getting my bishop in on the action} Kb8 18. Qxh7 Nce7 19. c3 Rfh8 20. Qg7 Bc5 21. b4 {From here it's all over. Once the pawns hit his castled position he's as good as dead.} Bb6 22. Bf7 Rdf8 {?surely rd-g8 was better?} 23. Bxg6 Nxg6 24. Qxg6 Rhg8 25. Qh7 c6 26. Rab1 Bd8 {! Drat. The last two moves were made to protect c7} 27. b5 c5 28. b6 a6 {My pawn is on the 6th rank! he should have taken it} 29. Rb3 Bf6 {??? What?? This must mean he's putting all his trust in his b pawn. To bigger job for a measly pawn} 30. Qc7+ Ka8 31. Ra3 Rg7 {This is brilliant even if i say so myself. I'm very good at puzzles, but rarely get an oppurtunity to put them into practice} 32. Rxa6+ bxa6 33. b7+ {Black resigns because 33.b7  ka7 34.b8=Q#}
