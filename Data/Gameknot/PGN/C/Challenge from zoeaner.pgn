1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Entering the Petrov Defence.} 3. Bc4 {Now I should probably have taken the e4 pawn, but I've never been in this situation before and I only thought about White's attack on the f7 pawn. That's why I played the safe Nc6} Nc6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 {Ulvestadt Variation. I've always preferred this move over Na5.} 6. Bxb5 {I believe Bf1 is best here. It defends the g2 pawn, keeping Black's counterattack at bay. The B5 pawn can then be grabbed later.} Qxd5 7. Bxc6+ Qxc6 8. O-O {This allows a dangerous attack at the White King.} Bb7 9. Nf3 g5 {Don't know if this theoretically the best move, but it sure looks dangerous for White!} 10. h3 h5 {The last two moves allow the opening of the h-file. I have hopes of exploiting that.} 11. d4 {Attacks the g5 pawn. Losing it stops my attack, so I figured I had to continue with the attack.} g4 12. dxe5 {I had thought long about my next move. Capturing his knight with 12. ... gxf3 looks better for White on account of 13. exf6 gxf2 14. Te1+ and I have to give up my dark-squared-bishop to avoid mate. Then my king is in greater danger while my attack is blunted by my own pawn! I had to find a way to keep the e-file closed while also being able to remove my king from danger which is impossible at the moment because White's Queen guards the d-file. That's why I played the next move.} Nd7 13. hxg4 hxg4 {Opening the h-file!} 14. Ne1 {Forced. Other moves lose the knight or the king.} g3 {Trying to open the g1-a7 diagonal for my dark-squared bishop. White probably should have played something like Qf3 instead of the next move.} 15. fxg3 Bc5+ 16. Rf2 {Forced.} Rh1+ {This sacrifice (well, not really a sacrifice) keeps the king confined to the h-file, something that can be of use for my other rook.} 17. Kxh1 Bxf2 18. Nf3 {Threatening mate on g2 due  to the knight being attacked. The poor horse has to return to f3.} O-O-O {Threatening a devastating check on h8, as well as being able to move my inactive knight with tempo. } 19. Nh4 {Guarding against the check on h8?} Bxg3 {Threatening mate on g2 yet again.} 20. Nf3 {The knight has to return.} Nxe5 {Attacking both the knight and the queen. Funny to see how White's queenside is still undeveloped.} 21. Qe2 Nxf3 22. Qxf3 Rd1+ {A rook sacrifice! White's has to take rook because to avoid mate,, but then gets mated anyway on the good old g2-square. Thanks for watching! Hope you enjoyed it!}
