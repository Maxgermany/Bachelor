1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 d5 4. e3 e6 5. Be2 {I'm not sure this was best.  Nc3 is more common.  But with the Black pawn on g6, Bd3 isn't the best diagonal.} Bg7 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. a3 O-O 9. Qc2 dxc4 10. Bxc4 b5 11. Be2 Bb7 {Black has developed nicely, but White may be able to get some pressure on the c file.} 12. Bd2 Ne7 13. Rac1 Rc8 14. Rfd1 c6 15. b4 {Now Black is saddled with a backward pawn on the c file, which can be a pain to deal with all game.} Nfd5 16. Ne4 Nc7 17. Nc5 Ba8 {White is maybe a little better here, but Black has things covered up pretty well.} 18. Ne5 Bxe5 19. dxe5 Ned5 20. Bc3 {Black can't play Nxc3 immediately because of Rxd8.} Qe7 21. Bd4 f5 22. exf6 e.p. Nxf6 {Now Black will also have to deal with an isolated e pawn.} 23. Bf3 {In retrospect, 23.Be5 would have been better.  After Bxc7, Nxa6 is possible.} e5 24. Bb2 Nfd5 25. Bxd5+ cxd5 {Poorly played by White.  Now Black's central pawn mass is more effective.} 26. Qb3 Rcd8 27. e4 Rf7 28. exd5 Bxd5 29. Qe3 Rf5 30. Ne4 Rdf8 31. Rxc7 {Black resigned here.  I was surprised because I thought Black still had plenty of play.  After Qxc7, White can play Rxd5, but Black has the annoying Qc2, attacking the hanging B on b2.  White's Q is overloaded and can't guard the d5 R, the b2 B, the e4 N, and the back rank threat of Qb1+ all at the same time.  }
