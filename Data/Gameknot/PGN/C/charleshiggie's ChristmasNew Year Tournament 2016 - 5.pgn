1. e4 {This is an interesting companion to my other recent annotation http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/oswestry-v-telepost-shropshire-league?gm=62607 In that game, I had rook, knight and two pawns for the queen, and, on an open board, the queen was slightly better. In this game, I also have to give up my queen - but my two rooks are far better than the queen on the closed board.} c5 {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence} 2. Nf3 {The most common move.} Nc6 {My usual, although 2....d6 is more popular, normally leading to the Najdorf_Variation or the Dragon_Variation} 3. Bb5 {Rossolimo Variation - a well-respected alternative to 3.d4. It is named after Nicolas Rossolimo and is related to the Moscow Variation. White's usual intention is to play Bxc6, giving Black doubled pawns. Black's major responses are 3...g6 preparing ...Bg7, 3...d6 preparing ...Bd7 (a hybrid line that also arises from the Moscow Variation after 2...d6 3.Bb5+ Nc6), and 3...e6 preparing 4...Nge7. Sergei Rublevsky and Tomáš Oral both play this line as well as the Moscow Variation.} e6 {This is my usual reply, although g6 is more common.} 4. O-O {The usual move.} Nge7 {In this way I prevent him from doubling my c pawns.} 5. c3 {Thematic - preparing to play d2-d4 with a good strong pawn centre.} a6 {So I attack his bishop.} 6. Bxc6 {He takes.} Nxc6 {I take back.} 7. d4 {He gets his centre.} d5 {But I don't give him too much of a free hand there.} 8. e5 {The position is a little like an advanced French here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence#Advance_Variation:_3.e5 But compared to the Advanced variation of the French Defence, white's bishop has been exchanged for a black knight, so black is slightly less cramped. Having said that, in a blocked position like this, the knight is better than the bishop. Chances are about equal} Be7 {So I develop.} 9. Be3 {So does he.} b6 {I protect my c pawn as in Semenova, Lidia K (2271) vs. Kernazhitsky, Leonid (2355) which ended in a draw. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x1306386&fb=1&mv=18&rnd=0.27965961272303885} 10. Nbd2 {He deviates from that game, and I am thinking for myself!} O-O {The logical move.} 11. Ne1 {The move was played on move 10 in Semenova, Lidia K (2271) vs. Kernazhitsky, Leonid (2355) followed by f2-f4, but my opponent has another plan.} a5 {Played to get my bC8 into play.} 12. Ndf3 {I'm not sure why my opponent did this knight manoeuvre. It doesn't seem to have achieved anything.} f6 {Gameknot gives this as a mistake, and suggests  … cxd4 13. Bxd4 Nxd4 14. Nxd4 Qc7 15. Nd3 a4 16. Qd2 Ba6 17. Rfe1 a3 18. b3 Rac8 19. Rac1 Qd7 20. Rcd1 b5 as best for both sides, but I am not convinced. Maybe 12....Ba6 was best, as planned.} 13. Nd3 {He re-enforced e5.} Ba6 {Bishop finally reaches a6} 14. Re1 {The logical square for the rook.} Bxd3 {Getting rid of my "bad" bishop, and removing a protector of e5.} 15. Qxd3 {He takes back.} Qc7 {Threatening his pawn on e5.} 16. Bf4 {He protects it, threatening e5xf6 with a discovered attack on my queen in some variations.} f5 {So I stop that. With my white-squared bishop gone, I am not afraid of putting pawns on white squares.} 17. Rac1 {Logical to put his rook on the same file as my queen.} c4 {So I block up the c file.} 18. Qd2 {His queen drops back.} h6 {Stopping his knight from coming to g5.} 19. h4 {He is clearly going to attack on the king-side.} b5 {And my on the queen-side!} 20. a3 {He tries to slow my attack.} b4 {But I advance any way.} 21. Bxh6 {He throws in the bishop sacrifice.} bxa3 {I decide that rather than accept, I will grab a pawn on the other side of the board. } 22. bxa3 {He takes back.} Bxa3 {I grab the pawn.} 23. Rcb1 {Gameknot computer says this is a mistake and instead suggests 23. Ra1 gxh6 24. Rxa3 Qg7 25. Qc2 Rfb8 26. Raa1 Ra6 27. Reb1 Rxb1+ 28. Rxb1 a4 29. Qb2 a3 30. Qa2 Ra8 31. Kf1 which does seem pretty level.} gxh6 {I finally take the bishop.} 24. Qxh6 {He takes back.} Rae8 {Played to protect the e pawn. Gameknot says it is a mistake and recommends  Nd8 25. Rb5 Rf7 26. Ng5 Bf8 27. Qh5 Rg7 28. Ra1 a4 29. Qh6 Qc6 30. Rbb1 Be7 31. Ra2 Ra7 32. Re2 The computer is probably right, but I didn't want to break the connection between my rooks.} 25. Ng5 {Attacking e6 again.} Qg7 {Of course, piece for pawn up, I offer a queen exchange.} 26. Qh5 {Which my opponent wisely declines.} Nd8 {Overprotecting e6 but Gameknot computer suggests Bb4 27. Rec1 Re7 28. Ra1 Rb8 29. Ra2 Ree8 30. cxb4 axb4 31. Rd1 b3 32. Rb2 Re7 33. Qf3 Qh6 34. Qf4 Ra7 35. Kh2 instead. It is certainly an interesting concept - to return the piece to get two powerful passed pawns on the queen-side. } 27. f4 {Gameknot prefers 27. Rb6 Qh8 28. Qg6+ Qg7 29. Qh5 and maybe a draw by repetition. I also wonder about the immediate 27. Re3 preparing Rg3} Nf7 {I seek to remove his attacking knight for my defensive knight, but gameknot says it is yet another mistake and suggests  … Be7 28. Rb5 Bxg5 29. fxg5 Nc6 30. Rc5 Rc8 31. Rb1 Rc7 32. Rb6 Nxe5 33. Rxc7 Qxc7 34. Rxe6 Qf7 35. Qxf7+ Nxf7 36. Re7} 28. Re3 {A good attacking move.} Nxg5 {So I remove the aggressive knight. OK, find black's best move here? } 29. Rg3 {Did you find it? Instead of the automatic recapture many would make, white find a wonderful to keep his attack alive. I have to play really carefully over the next few moves.} Be7 {So my bishop comes back to prevent Rxg5} 30. Rb7 {But white pins the bishop, and threatens Rxe7 followed by Rxg5.} Rf7 {So I break the pin. I did also consider Nf7 here, with the idea that after he takes my queen with check, I have rook, knight and bishop for the queen, but his rook is very active, for instance my a pawn is going. I think that would be very hard to win.} 31. Rxe7 {He take a defender.} Nh3+ {I throw in a check} 32. Kh2 {Forced, as he has to protect his rook.} Rexe7 {So I get first one rook for my queen.} 33. Kxh3 {This is given as a mistake by Gameknot which gives 33. Rxg7+ Rxg7 34. gxh3 a4 35. Qd1 Ra7 36. Qh5 Rae7. It seems strange to allow doubled h pawns, but in the game the white king is drawn to g3, meaning the white queen cannot check on g6 or g5 as black can defend with Rg7, pinning the white queen against the black king.} Qxg3+ {Taking a second rook, and also drawing the white king onto the g file} 34. Kxg3 {Forced.} a4 {This pawn is a winner.} 35. Qe2 {The white queen hurries back to stop the pawn, but as the next few moves show, she is incapable of doing so.} a3 36. Qa2 Rea7 37. Kh3 {This is a bit of a strange move, perhaps freeing up the g pawn?} Rfb7 {Black is clearly winning.} 38. h5 Rb2 39. Qa1 a2 40. Qxb2 a1=Q {The game is over really, the rest is just mopping up and need few comments.} 41. Qxa1 Rxa1 42. Kh4 Kg7 43. Kg5 Rh1 44. g4 Rg1 45. h6+ Kh7 46. Kf6 fxg4 47. Kxe6 g3 48. f5 g2 49. f6 Rf1 50. Ke7 g1=Q 51. f7 Qg5+ 52. Ke8 Qg6 53. Ke7 Rxf7+ 54. Ke8 Qg8# {Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system, to let me know how I am getting on.
