1. e4 c5 2. Be2 Nc6 3. Nf3 e6 4. c4 g6 5. b3 Bg7 6. Nc3 b6 7. Bb2 Nge7 8. Rb1 O-O 9. Nb5 {Everything seems ok to me up to here. I really like White's development, though having played this I'd be looking to follow with d4 as soon as possible otherwise the d pawn could become a liability. You also want to castle but there is no imminent pressure.} d5 10. Bxg7 {Why exchange if you don't have to? I'm not sure this greatly benefits White's position, unless you have an imminent usage for the B1 rook that you want it freed up for.} Kxg7 11. cxd5 {I think this is the wrong side. You have no real choice now to either make D2 into an isolated pawn, or to give me a solid spatial advantage in the middle. 11. exd5 exd5 12. O-O would have been fine I think, and 12. d4 is probably an option.} exd5 12. d3 d4 {With E2 on the white squares, locking this position seems advantageous for Black from the point of view of restricting white mobility and gaining useful space in the centre.} 13. O-O Ba6 14. a4 {I don't like this, you've kind of weakened B3 quite terminally as the diagonal is available, and it can not easily advance to b4 now. I would have simply retreated to Na3 allowing Nc4 and some future involvement of the knight.} Qd7 {Perhaps should have just doubled the white pawns here, but wanted further development.} 15. Qd2 Bxb5 16. axb5 {I decided that doubled pawns on your side would be sufficiently difficult to defend that it was worth removing my good bishop for. This seems to be slightly costly already for White.} Nb4 {Attacking the b5 pawn. You cannot defend it.} 17. e5 {This was a positionally weak move. It is hard to maintain the defence of e5 as it has lost the protection of the d pawn, tying your knight up. This was definitely one of your more costly moves.} Ned5 {Instead of capturing the pawn, I decided it would be better to get hold of C3 for my knight, a lovely square for it to oversee your whole back two ranks. Because your bishop is on the white squares it will be very hard to shift for you, and b5 isn't going to get defended any time soon.} 18. Ng5 Nc3 19. Rb2 Qf5 {It's far more useful to have the knight at C3 than to exchange for the bishop. It will be a pain for quite some time for you there. Instead I try to force the knight of its happy home, by locking the queen into its defence, and threaten the now undefended e5 pawn. If you return the knight, I can simply add the rook to the attack and you cannot defend. 20.f4 would be very interesting though.} 20. Bf3 {Good idea to free the file and threaten my rook, except my rook will move to e8 and doulbe the attack. This has also removed the possibility of moving your f pawn forwards in defence. At this stage, without my black bishop on the table, I don't think you have to be concerned about opening up the diagonal, and the positional strength it would have is quite significant.} Rae8 21. Re1 Rxe5 22. Rxe5 Qxe5 {Going a pawn up.} 23. Ne4 {You cannot capture my knight, because the corresponding dxc3 would lose you a piece, so I can ignore this move.} Re8 {Gaining presence on the open file.} 24. g3 f5 25. Ng5 Qe1+ {Forced the exchange to get my rook onto the back rank, and because of the check I get to capture the d pawn, giving me a strong passed pawn and increasing my lead to 2 pawns.} 26. Qxe1 Rxe1+ 27. Kg2 Nxd3 28. Rd2 Nb4 {Positionally the game is extremely hard for White. Only 3 pawns sit on white squares, greatly reducing the effectiveness of your bishop, although your knight is very active and probably your best chance for any counterplay. With the e file gone to my rook and my knights in active positions, it will be very hard to utilise your rook. E2, D3, E3, D1, C2 and A2 are all effectively removed from the Rooks positions, making it impossible for the rook to get involved.} 29. Bc6 {A nice idea, I decided getting your knight out of the action was very important.} h6 30. Nf3 Re6 31. Bd7 Re7 32. Bc6 Nxc6 {It will now be very hard for you to defend the b pawn after the capture, giving me time to (hopefully) go 3 pawns ahead, after which defending the queenside will be impossible and I will seek to exchange material.} 33. bxc6 Kf6 34. b4 Rc7 35. bxc5 bxc5 36. h4 Rxc6 {Now three pawns ahead, with no opposition to any of my queenside pawns, I'm going to start advancing as quickly as possible.} 37. Rd3 {An awkward move, as neither the capture nor E3 appeals. This lost important momentum.} a5 38. Rd2 a4 39. Rc2 a3 {With 3 "free" advancement moves, it becomes very hard to see how this pawn can be stopped without sacrificing further material.} 40. Nd2 a2 41. Nb3 Rb6 42. Na1 {Probably better was 42. Rb2, but after 42... a1=Q 43. Nxa1 Rxb2 your knight is completely pinned and can do nothing to stop the d pawn advancing, so it makes little odds.} Rb1 43. Rxc3 dxc3 44. Nc2 a1=Q 45. Nxa1 Rxa1 46. f4 c2 {Many thanks for the game :)  I would have said that 11. cxd5, allowing doubled pawns with 14. a4, and 17. e5 were the three moves that cost you this game, but you generally didn't make any big mistakes apart from that that I could see.}
