1. e4 c6 2. g3 {This is really odd.  I like playing the caro kann because it is really solid and actually affords black a lot of aggressive attacking positions (contrary to popular belief).  Normally when I see some try to play anything but the actual main lines I generally assume they aren't very prepared to face the CK!} d5 3. Bg2 dxe4 {All too happy to exchange the pawn and get my knight out with tempo.} 4. Bxe4 Nf6 5. Bg2 Bg4 {I like this better than Bf4.  I am trying to lure Nf3 as whites knight on f3 is almost always better than my LSB in a lot of Caro Kann positions.} 6. f3 {This is a bad move.  It unnecessarily opens up white's king side.} Bh5 7. Ne2 {I think Nh3 might have been better.  Either way the pawn on f3 is not promising for white.} e6 8. O-O Bg6 {I am taking time with development as white's handling of the opening is completely passive and non-threatening.} 9. Kh1 {Probably because he didn't want to see any checks on the g1-a7 diagonal. } h6 {To prevent any uncomfortable Nf4 or pawn bum rushes on my LSB.} 10. Nbc3 {I really don't like this move.  I'm sure it's ok but white is basically showing that he doesn't care about establishing a pawn center in the middle of the board.} Bd6 11. d3 {Planning to put a knight on e4.  } Nbd7 {Finishing up development.} 12. Nf4 Bh7 13. Be3 O-O {Development completed.  Let's start the party!} 14. Bh3 {Not really sure what the point of this is.  I think since white can't initiate a pawn break at all he is looking for play with his pieces.  Though there really is nothing for him to attack yet.} Re8 {Preparing e5.} 15. Qc1 {Again, no idea what white is doing.} Qc7 16. Ne4 {This looks like a solid move.  That square should be occupied by a knight.} e5 {Starting to attack the center.} 17. Nxd6 Qxd6 {White trades his best piece.} 18. Ne2 Nd5 {I like this move.  I am preparing f7-f5.  White can't challenge my knight with c4 as the d3 pawn would become extremely weak.} 19. Bf2 Rad8 {Putting the other rook on the half-open d-file.} 20. a3 {White was probably considering c4 but didn't want ...Nb4 as a response.} f5 {Claiming more space on the king side and getting ready for Nd5-f6 in case of c4.} 21. Nc3 {White offers doubled-c pawns.} Nd7f6 {Preparing e4.} 22. Re1 Nxc3 23. bxc3 {Doubling white's c pawns.} e4 {Initiating the pawn break.  White's king is pretty much completely exposed.} 24. dxe4 fxe4 25. f4 {White attempts to keep his king side somewhat secure at the expense of black gaining an extremely strong passed pawn. Aron would be so proud!} Qd5 {The beginning of a tactical onslaught.  This obviously threatens a discovered check however I am planning on bringing the queen over to the h file.} 26. Bg2 Qh5 {This creates a number of uncomfortable problems for white.} 27. Re3 {White has to prepare for black to play Ng4.  I think he should have played something like Bg1. } Ng4 {Threatens mate on h2.} 28. Qg1 {Again, white could have played Bg1 here, (unless I'm missing something).  This is playable though uncomfortable for white as all of his pieces are tied to defense.} Rd2 {Now threatening Nxf2.  Here white should have played Be1.} 29. Rf1 {Instead he plays Rf1.  This is a tactical oversight.} Rxf2 30. Rxf2 {In order not to lose the queen white leaves the Rook on e3 hanging.} Nxe3 31. Re2 {White loses his mind and the game.} Qxe2 {White resigns.}
