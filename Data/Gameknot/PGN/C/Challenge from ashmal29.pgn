1. d4 {This was a hard fought battle that remained fairly even until a late slip up by me gave a winning chance to my opponent who played solidly to take it.} d5 2. c4 {Queens Gambit, my prefered opening as white. Appears to give away a pawn, but if I take it I will struggle to hold onto it.} e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 {Still standard development, although more common here is Bg5 with the threat of Bxf6, winning a pawn, or creating a structural weakness.} Bb4 5. Bd2 Bd7 6. e3 O-O 7. Be2 c5 {Both sides still developing rapidly, minding their own business. This move looks to open the centre up, having castled early.} 8. O-O cxd4 9. Nxd4 dxc4 10. Bxc4 {I choose to open the centre, at the cost of better position for my opponent. I feel that the open game is more to my style of play, and I can fight my way back into the match easily.} Nc6 {Natural development, hoping to encourage 11. Nxc6 Bxc6 which improves my position.} 11. Nce2 {This move makes the threat of 12. Nxc6 Bxc6 13. Bxb4 winning the bishop} Bxd2 {The easiest move, the knight no longer has to defend the bishop. Perhaps better is Bd6, as whites d2 bishop was trapped behind the wall of pawns.} 12. Qxd2 {Naturally recaptures} Ne5 {A simple threat to the undefended bishop, and improves my position as: 1) My knight holds a powerful square in the centre 2) My d7 bishop can now get out onto the board 3) The c-file is now wide open offering good attacking chances (to either side) The other posibility would have been ...e5, driving the powerfully placed white knight away and gaining a tempo to move out the rook on the next move.} 13. Rac1 {Defends the knight and places a rook on the open file.} Rc8 {I don't want to lose the file without a fight, and I put a second attacker on the bishop. Perhaps better would be ...Nxc4, capturing the bishop for the knight. Then in an endgame i would have the bishop / knight combination against two knights.} 14. b3 {Defends the bishop, but better would have been Bb3 ready to reroute round to c2 in case of a kingside attack. This move weakens the pawn structure and allows me to trade a knight for a bishop.} Nxc4 15. Rxc4 {Rather than weaken the pawn structure white recaptures with the rook giving me the option to keep the heavy pieces or weaken his pawns.} Rxc4 {I chose to capture an easy choice as I have the chance to put pressure on the 2 isolated pawns. It also prevented white from getting doubled rooks on the c-file, which could give him a significant positional advantage.} 16. bxc4 Qc7 {I make a small threat while improving my position, but again I failed to push the e-pawn forwards} 17. Rc1 {A natural move setting up potencial threats against the queen} Ng4 {A slightly slow move by me, unable to find anything constructive I chose to make a threat hoping to provoke a mistake} 18. f4 {Easily defended, though perhaps Ng3 would be better as now the e3 pawn looks very weak} Rd8 {Planning to set up a pin on the knight, though again e5 looks the better move. After 18...e5 19. fxe5 Qxe5 threatens both checkmate and the e-pawn.} 19. h3 {Sensibly driving the knight away from his king} Nf6 20. Qb4 {Although there is no clear threat against the queen, this move ensures white is not caught out with a pin along the d-file.} h6 {A quiet move protecting against any back rank threats} 21. Nb5 {Threats against both queen and pawn, and the pin along the c-file deters me from taking the knight with the bishop.} Qb6 {Counters the threat with 2 of my own. The e3 pawn is undefended, and I am threatening a6 as the knight cannot move since the queen is undefended} 22. Qb3 {Removes both threats} a6 23. Nbd4 Qxb3 {My usual style is to remove queens early, probably better is Qc7, keeping whites pawns isolated.} 24. axb3 Ne4 {The knight jumps to a strong square blocking the weak backwards e3 pawn} 25. b4 {With my knight freezing the progress of whites kingside he pushes the queenside. The rook and knights are well placed to help this advance} Rc8 {I try to activate the rook as the bishop is trapped by the e-pawn I failed to move.} 26. c5 g5 {My queenside is now frozen, so I turn my attention to the kingside. Perhaps better is f6, planning to push e5 freeing the bishop.} 27. g3 gxf4 {Hoping to open the position} 28. exf4 Kg7 29. Kg2 {Both of us move the kings closer to the middle, as in the endgame the king becomes far stronger with so few pieces left on the board} Kf6 {A clumsy move taking away the knights retreat square} 30. Kf3 {Attacks the knight which cannot escape} Nxc5 {Thinking I couldn't protect the knight I sacrificed it for the pawn and hoped for counter play down the a and b files. I could have saved it with e5 at the expense of a pawn} 31. Rxc5 {As white has a material advantage he wants to trade off the pieces} Rxc5 {Despite wanting to keep pieces on the board the white rook is too dangerous so I am forced to capture it.} 32. bxc5 e5 {With a material deficit I can't afford to sit back and defend. This move threatens the knight and the h3 pawn. After the capture on e5 my king moves into a strong position in the middle of the board} 33. fxe5+ Kxe5 34. g4 {Natuarally defends the pawn} Kd5 35. Nb3 Bc6 {Threatening Kc4  winning the knight after the king moves out of check} 36. Kf4 {Moves out of the line of the bishop. Another move would be Nd4, as white will want to trade off the bishop} Kc4 {Wins the pawn, but at a cost. White will now check and remove the bishop. Note that Ned4 wont help as Ba4 drives the knight away and I win the d4 knight} 37. Na5+ Kxc5 38. Nxc6 Kxc6 {With no pieces left and my king unable to help the king side pawns I resign myself to pushing the queenside pawns and praying for a mistake.} 39. Ke4 b5 40. Kd3 Kc5 41. Kc3 a5 42. h4 a4 {A careless move, I could have run my king across to the kingside to pick up the 2 pawns, and force a draw} 43. h5 b4+ 44. Kb2 {Starting to look like there is some hope. Though it will be difficult pushing the pawns any further. I should have been thinking about protecting the kingside, which I though was lost because of the presence of the knight} Kc4 {A final careless move, I needed to play f6 to prevent whites next (and winning) move.} 45. g5 {I am now lost, i can only hope to push my pawns forwards enough to distract white.} hxg5 46. h6 Kd3 47. h7 {White has no need to protect the knight, he will promote the pawn next move and mop up my pawns easily. A good lesson, never get too focused on one section of the board causing you to forget another, I had chances to force a draw and failed as i ignored my kingside.}
