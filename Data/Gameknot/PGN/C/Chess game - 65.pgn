1. d3 {This not an important game - but I leave you with a position where you have to find the next move - it is an interesting tactic!} e5 {So I seize the centre.} 2. Nf3 {He develops a knight.} Nc6 {I protect my e pawn.} 3. g3 {He opts for a Modern Defence Reversed. } d5 {And I seize the centre. } 4. Bg2 {He completes the fianchetto.} f6 {Preparing Be6, - I don't want it hit with Ng5.} 5. b3 {This is passive - he needs to castle and then hit my centre.} Be6 {According to plan.} 6. Bb2 {He completes the queen-side fianchetto.} Qd7 {Also according to plan.} 7. O-O {Natural - but rather falling in with my plans.} Bc5 {Part of the standard attacking formation - see comparisons with the Yugoslav Attack against the Sicilian Dragon. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Dragon_Variation,_Yugoslav_Attack,_9.Bc4} 8. Re1 {So that if I play Bh3 he can retreat his bishop.} Nge7 {Continuing with my development.} 9. Nbd2 {And he with his.} O-O-O {All part of the plan.} 10. c4 {Finally he hits my centre.} g5 {This is actually a mistake.} 11. cxd5 {He takes.} Bxd5 {As his Nb1 is committed to d2, I can play this - otherwise I would have taken back with the knight - although maybe this is a mistake too, as he could now have play Ne4, attacking Bc5 and f6, forcing me to play Bd5xNe4.} 12. a3 {White correctly starts queen-side operations - although maybe Ne4 was better.} Ng6 {Now Ne4 can be met with Be7.} 13. b4 {So he hits my bishop.} Bb6 {Bishop drops back.} 14. Nc4 {He attacks my bishop - I can't prevent the exchange, but so what, I am attacking him on the king-side.} h5 {So I continue.} 15. Nxb6+ {He takes with check.} axb6 {I take back.} 16. Qa4 {Threatening a check on a8. It doesn't do that much, but I decide on balance to prevent it with....} Kb8 {This move.} 17. e4 {Perhaps stopping g5-g4 and the exchange of white squared bishops, but leaving his d pawn backwards on a semi-open file. } Be6 {So the bishop drops back.} 18. Red1 {Hoping to get in d3-d4 presumably.} Bh3 {Threatening to exchange bishops.} 19. Bh1 {OK find black's next move?  Thank you for reading.
