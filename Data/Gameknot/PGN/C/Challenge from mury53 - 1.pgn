1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Bg5 Be7 4. Nc3 b6 5. e4 Bb7 {This is an odd way to get into an Owen's Defense setup.  Usually Bb4 is played to pin the Nc3, but the move order was different here.} 6. e5 Ne4 7. Bxe7 Qxe7 {Because of White's exchanges, White is now lagging slightly in development.} 8. Nf3 d6 9. Bd3 Nxc3 10. bxc3 Nd7 11. Qd2 Bxf3 {After the Q moves off d1, the N is protected only by the g pawn.  Black proceeds to ruin White's pawn structure.} 12. gxf3 dxe5 13. dxe5 Nxe5 {Now White's pawn structure is a shambles.  Black has an extra pawn too, but that won't be the deciding factor.  Black just has to exchange down to an endgame and White is finished.} 14. Be2 Rd8 15. Qe3 Ng6 16. O-O {I was a little surprised by this move considering that the K is exposed, but it does link the Rooks nicely.} O-O 17. Rad1 Qh4 18. Rxd8 Rxd8 {Exchanges toward an endgame just help Black at this point.} 19. Rd1 {This loses another pawn.  After Bxd1, the c4 pawn will be hanging.} Rxd1+ 20. Bxd1 Qxc4 21. Bb3 Qf4 22. Qd3 {White correctly avoids exchanging Queens.  There is no back row mate because Black can always interpose with Nf8.  White's Bishop cannot attack on the dark squares.  The only threat White has in this position is Qa6.} a5 {Preventing Qa6.  Black's plan is simple.  Protect the c7 pawn, create a blowhole for the King, and proceed to exchange down into an endgame where White cannot protect all of the isolated pawns.} 23. a4 Qc1+ 24. Kg2 {I was expecting Bd1.  Then I can create pressure with Qf4 and Qd6.  Kg2 loses instantly.} Nf4+ {White resigned in the face of Nxd3 next move.}
