1. e4 {This is a game against a new player on our team that I thought could be instructive for our members.  I lost badly but I am not discouraged.  I felt I had some nice ideas, but he is a better player and found ways to exploit my mistakes.  I did not want a computer analysis to influence my thoughts so I have did not have one run yet but I will after the annotation.   } c5 {I am trying to learn the Sicilian Defense so that is all I play right now against 1. e4.   } 2. Nf3 d6 {Black uses another pawn move and gets further behind in development but black should still be able to equalize eventually.   } 3. Bb5+ {I typically do not see this move so I am already out of my 'book' for the Sicilian Defense.  I'm sure this is still in 'book' but I do not like to study openings.   } Nc6 {I feel like development is the way to go here even though there is the threat of 4. e5.  I would reply with 4....Bd7 instead of getting into trouble with 4....dxe5.   } 4. O-O {I expect white to push the d-pawn out to d4 but this is not a surprise.   } Bd7 {I have been burned before with tactics against the c6 square in this situation before so I develop and protect that square further.  I don't like that I have nothing on the kingside developed yet but I feel like this has to be done first. } 5. Re1 {Again, I am expecting 5. d4 but my opponent lines up his rook with my king.  Possibly to support the eventual e5 central space gaining push.     } g6 {My response was probably not the best.  For some reason, I did not like the variations I played out in my head after 5....Nf6.  I felt my opponent could respond with 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 7. e5.  I must have had a blind spot here because I was worried about 7....dxe5 8. Qxd8+ Kd8.  The problem with this line is that it is not possible....white's d-pawn is still on the board which is usually not the case in the openings I see often.  With my opponent this far ahead in development, I don't think taking two tempos to develop my dark squared bishop is the way to go here but I failed to see the danger.   } 6. c3 {My opponent prepares the d4 push and works to build a large pawn center.   } Bg7 {Finishing the fianchetto which hits the d4 square a third time.  Not enough since white can remove one defender of it any time (Bxc6).   } 7. d4 {White gains central space and will enjoy freedom of movement for his pieces.   } cxd4 8. cxd4 Nf6 {I have caught up in development with all four minor pieces out.  My opponent has 3 pieces out (bishop, knight, and rook) and castled.  The important imbalance favors white though.  The e4 and d4 pawns give his pieces room to work and restrict mine.  My king is still stuck in the center so I must castle before my opponent can get the rest of his pieces mobilized. } 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Be2 {I was expecting 10. Bf4 or Be3 developing the dark squared bishop.  I felt like this retreat gave me the chance to equalize but I did not see how.  The plan here should have been to add pressure to white's center but that was not my plan during the game.   } Rc8 {I decided to improve my rook with this tempo but again I don't feel it was best looking back.  I can put pressure on white's d-pawn with 10....Bg4 threatening to remove a defender of the d4 pawn.  Controlling the only open file was my plan at this stage...wrong plan when an opponent has a large center.  } 11. h3 {I felt like this was a wasted tempo during the game.  However it is right on.  White is indirectly defending his center and I didn't even realize it during the game.  Now the f3 knight is a great piece....it is stable (means it can not be traded anytime soon) and it serves an important offensive role (attacking the e5 square) and defensive role (defending the d4 pawn).   Even though the trading value assigned to a knight is equal to that of 3 pawns....this knight is far more valuable due to it's quality.  Quality is determined by several factors but stability and role played are two important ones.  Again, during the game, I did not even realize it but I'm quite sure my opponent was proud of his great piece.   } a6 {All I was working on right now was double my rooks on the c-file.  There is nothing there to gain but I thought that was my ticket to winning the game.  This prepared my rook lift to Rc7 by keeping the c3 knight from Nb5.   } 12. Be3 {Now my opponent strengthens his center further and develops.   } e6 {I finally go back to playing in the center of the board but have no decent options.  My opponent already dominates there.  I checked 12...e5 that allows 13. d5 which forces my knight back to e7 and my pieces have nowhere to go.  I checked 12...d5 but 13. e5 has the same effect.  I see an opportunity to lose an exchange down the road with rook for knight on c3 then grabbing the e4 pawn to break down his center so I prepare to open that file.   } 13. Rc1 {White challenges the c-file.   } Ne7 {Here goes.  I have to get my pieces some activity so I set myself up for a sacrifice. } 14. Bd3 {Really....did my opponent see that coming as well?  If you look into a chess book about how to ideally place your pieces....white is two moves away.  The queen on e2 or d2 and the c-rook on d1 would be a textbook piece placement and I have allowed it.   } b5 {My last ditch attempt is to trade down.  The player with the cramped position should search for even trades to alleviate some of the lack of mobility problems.  I look to kick his knight from the c3 square and trade rooks.  Less pieces need less room to work.   } 15. Qd2 Bc6 {I saw a chance to make some exchanges in the center so I bailed on my last plan.   } 16. a3 {My opponent prevents 16....b4.  Always a step ahead of me.   } d5 {Now I lose my nerve a little here and go for a pawn sacrifice that hopefully (a bad way to play chess is move and hope) gives me enough activity for the sacrifice.  I know my opponent is likely to respond with 17. e5 gaining more space.  17.....Nd7 makes my light squared bishop useless and my dark squared bishop can easily be exchanged whenever my opponent wishes with Bh6 then Bxg7.  What I had in mind was to sacrifice the d-pawn for the bishop pair.  What I had worked out was the line...16...d5 17. e5 Ne4 (leads to a loss of my d-pawn) 18. Bxe4 (not 18. Nxe4?? due to the pawn fork 18....dxe4) dxe4 19. Ng5 winning the d-pawn on the next move.  I am aware this will happen.  I also know that white can force the exchange of dark squared bishops which gives me nothing for the sacrifice but I can exchange his dark squared bishop first.  After 19. Ng5 Nf5! is the way to keep my bishop pair.  If 20. Bf4 I can respond with 20....Qxd4 or 20...Nxd4 material equal again and much needed space gained.  I give 19...Nf5! because it accomplishes my idea not because it is a great move.   } 17. e5 {As expected not allowing exchanges and gaining space.  White is in complete control.   } Ne4 {Here is the sacrifice. } 18. Bxe4 {My opponent captures with the correct piece of course avoiding the blunder mentioned earlier. } dxe4 19. Ng5 {Will win the e4 pawn. } Nf5 {All according to plan.  Secures the capture of the dark squared bishop. } 20. Ngxe4 Nxe3 21. Qxe3 {Now I realize the error in my ways but it is far too late to go back now.  The bishop pair and the backward d-pawn make me feel like I have compensation for the lost pawn.  My analysis was excellent but my evaluation was terrible.  Analysis is calculating all the possible lines and captures.  I am pleased looking back to see that aspect of the game was correct for me.  Evaluation is looking at the position after the captures are over to see who stands better.  If you told me I was going to be down a pawn but have the bishop pair and the opponent has a backward pawn on an open file, I would say I like my chances.  The problem is, in this position, I would rather have the knights.  I didn't see it this way during the game, but my opponent easily turns this position into a win for him.  What I failed to recognize is that the holes in black's position (f6 and d6 are the worst ones) and the white knight's ability to access them give white all the play.  I saw 22. Nf6+ but that gives me back the pawn so I didn't worry about it.  I failed to see 22. Nd6 completely dominating the game.   } Qh4 {I admit I did not have any plan at this point.  I felt I accomplished something by getting the bishop pair and was in control.  This move keeps the initiative (so I think) by threatening to win the exchange with 22...Bh6.  I assume my opponent will see this but can't do anything about it.   } 22. f4 {My opponent takes action against my plan but I still like where I stand.  } Bh6 {Attacking f4 a second time. } 23. Ref1 {Defending f4.  I thought this was good for me before Bh6.  I considered the rook defending the f-pawn and calculated incorrectly.  23. Rf1 Bxe4 24. Nxe4 Rxc1 25. Rxc1 Qxf4 and I am loving my position.  However, I miss the easy solution for white.  23. Rf1 Bxe4 24. Qxe4 is what I failed to see and now white gets the initiative and the game from here.   } Rfd8 {Since my original plan fails I should probably get my queen out of there.  I sensed some danger at this point knowing Nf6+ is in the air but I fail to listen to my instincts.  I feel like I have to press on.   } 24. Nf6+ {No surprise there.  } Kh8 25. Kh2 {Now the game is all over.  White has trapped the black queen.   } Bg7 {This gives some breathing room for the queen. } 26. Nce4 {Here was a moment in the game where I was stubborn and would not give up the bishop pair.  If I exchanged here with 26...Bxe4 or 26...Bxf6, I might have been able to hold on for a while.  Again, not evaluating the knights vs bishops correctly in this position is why my ending came so quickly. } Bb7 27. g3 {Tightening the noose around my queen.   } Qh6 28. Ng5 {Amazing what the knights can do with advanced support points.  Of course the threat is 29. Nxf7+ forking my king, queen, and rook all at the same time.   } Rdf8 {It's over, but I cover the square f7 square anyway. } 29. Rxc8 Bxc8 30. Nfxh7 {I expected 30. Rc1 but this is a faster execution.   } Qxh7 {This game gives some really nice instruction on a couple of things.  The bishop pair is an imbalance (chess author Jeremy Silman's term) but only better if you can make the position better for them (they line an open position meaning central pawns are off the board).  The knights like to get deep onto enemy territory where they can not be pushed back by pawns (advanced outposts).  If you place a piece in a bad position, be 100% sure the tactics you are relying on will work.  21. Qh4 put my queen on the edge of the board where it could get trapped which it later was.  Better players would categorize my attempt to exploit the h6-c1 diagonal (white's queen and rook lined up on that diagonal) as a cheap trick.  I didn't think it was at the time, but it is good practice to assume your opponent will see your threats and find the best move.   }
