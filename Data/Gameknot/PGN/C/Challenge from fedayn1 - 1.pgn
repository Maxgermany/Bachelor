1. e4 {This was a second game between me and fedayn, I won the first one. He starts with e4} c6 {Last few days I was looking for a response to e4 which isn't that common to surprise my opponents. I don't like e5...already tried French but somehow i don't like it. I tried also d5 and even b5...so let's try Caro-Kann I'm not familiar with it so I'll just go with the flow....} 2. Nc3 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 Nc6 {just normal development with pressure on centre} 5. Bb5 e6 6. Nf3 Bd6 {preventing Ne5} 7. O-O Bd7 {breaking the pin and making way for queenside castle if neccesary} 8. Bg5 Be7 {maybe I shoud've played Ng6 but didn't wan't to walk into that annoying pin} 9. Bxe7 Ngxe7 {making way for castling and adding proteciton for c6} 10. Qd3 a6 11. Bxc6 Nxc6 12. Rfe1 Qb6 13. Na4 {attacking my queen and defends b2 ( which i wasn't planning to take)} Qc7 {so I have to retreat} 14. Nc5 {oops didn't see that coming} Bc8 15. Ng5 h6 16. Nxf7 {?? i'm not sure what was he trying to do here but this is a serious blunder...or maybe I'm missing something} Qxf7 17. c4 {i guess he's trying to break my center pawns} O-O {getting my king safe and also threatening Qxf2  ( weeee, castling with tempo :D)} 18. Re2 {so he defends} b6 {finally it's time to kick his knight from c5 } 19. cxd5 {but he makes a mistake... now i can attack his queen and then take his knight with my pawn } Nb4 20. dxe6 {he had a little different plan but no problems for me actually it helps since it develops my LSB (at last)} Bxe6 {now it's time for him to move the queen} 21. Qa3 bxc5 22. dxc5 Bc4 {trying to make him to remove his guard of f2} 23. Rd2 {but he stays on 2nd rank} Nd3 {adding more pressure on f2} 24. Rc2 {don't know why he did that, i guess he haven't noticed that the bishop is guarded by my queen} Nxf2 {finally, f2 :)} 25. b3 Bb5 {my bishop is very strong here...cannot be kicked from there, it controls a nice diagonal and puts pressure on f1 square which will prove to be fatal in few moves} 26. b4 Ng4 {i saw a possibility for a queen sac and a quick mate, i was just hoping that fedayn won't see it} 27. Qg3 {and he didn't... made conditional moves and went to bed :)} Qf1+ {he can't take with his king, only legal move....} 28. Rxf1 {.....Rxf1} Rxf1# {and i was glad I didn't trade my LSB for knight on move 14. :)  p.s. in case you were wondering why did I annotate this game, yes, it's because that nice queen sac in the end :)  cheers}
