1. d4 {im posting this annotation for a serious question about my opening, i need to see which of a certain move is better.} Nf6 2. e3 e6 {ok, that's expected(kind of)} 3. Nf3 {question one:  3 Nf3 .... or 3 c4... which is better? the other becomes move 4} d5 4. c4 c6 {that is an ugly pawn structure he has right there. all we know is that the c bishop isn't going anywhere anytime soon} 5. Bd2 {this is my main question, which is better: 5 Bd2 or 5 Nbd2?} Ng4 6. Ne5 Nxe5 7. dxe5 Qg5 {just an fyi. for the first time in one of my annotations: I take the queen through skill, not error. look for that around move 20.} 8. f4 {error on my part?} Qh4+ 9. g3 {now i have an uglier pawn structure. this guy knows how to take people into middle game, I'll give him that. } Qh6 {the queen never moves again.} 10. Qb3 {kind of a stupid move because the bishop can't really move anywhere. } dxc4 {then again...} 11. Qxc4 {as long as my queen is out, I might as well take advantage of the situation.} Be7 {develop and preparing for a castle. as you can see, my castiling ability is ... devastated. } 12. Nc3 b5 {oops. thats a mistake. a big one, two. } 13. Qe4 f5 {mistake?} 14. exf6 e.p. {or did he just forget en passent?} Bxf6 {was bishop take the best move?} 15. Nxb5 {this is just amazing. you have to watch this (the games already coming to an end) and that a8 rook is (as good as) dead} Bb7 {i thought that might happen... so:} 16. Nc7+ {awesome} Kf7 {now I COULD take the rook and be done with it. OR i could push the king a bit further. this is just awesome: watch this.} 17. Qxe6+ {5} Kg6 {i see a future pin coming.} 18. f5+ {4} Kg5 19. e4+ {3 this is just amazing. take a minute to absorb this.} Kg4 20. Bxh6 {2} Bxb2 {?!} 21. f6+ {1 these pawn pushes are really annoying to black right now.} Kf3 {was this the best possible move for black? I think so, but it is still mate.} 22. Qf5# {I didn't even notice this was mate until the little notice came up. he shouldn't have taken the b2 pawn and should've taken h6. }
