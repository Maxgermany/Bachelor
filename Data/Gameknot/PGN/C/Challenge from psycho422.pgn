[Opening "Bishop's opening (C23)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {Bishop's opening.} Nh6 {Unusual response.  Black actually does pretty well with Nf6 or Nc6.  Nh6--not so much.} 3. Qh5 {Not in the database.  Pf7 is protected by the curious Nh6.  Black should defend against QxPe5+.} Nc6 {Nc6 does the trick.} 4. Nf3 {White's advantage.} d6 {Black counters.} 5. Ng5 {Ooh, white threatens Pf7 with a lot of power, though g6 will change that.} g6 6. Qf3 {Nope.  Qh4 would protect Ng5, at least for the short term.  White's knight, however, is probably lost.} Qxg5 {If white castled, she could follow with BxNh6.  BxB, QxP+.  It is not a lot of advantage, and besides, without protecting h3 black could play Bh3, costing white a rook, considering that the black queen sits on the g file.} 7. b3 Nd4 {White must watch for NxPc2+, forking king and rook.} 8. Qd3 {White acknowledges the threat, but the king side castle is lost.} Qxg2 9. Rf1 Qxh2 10. c3 {Instead of scaring black's knight white should deal with the threat of Bh3.  What will black want to do next?  Probably Bh3.  Qg3 would be an expensive answer, given that down 5 points fair trades favor black.  But otherwise white stands to drop two more points with the bishop/rook exchange.} Bh3 11. cxd4 {I withdraw what I said earlier, the bishop and knight are worth more than the rook.} Bxf1 12. Qxf1 Qh4 13. Bb5+ {White should defend Pe4 instead, probably Pd3 which opens white's black bishop another door. } c6 14. Bc4 Qxe4+ 15. Qe2 Qxd4 16. Nc3 d5 17. Bd3 e4 18. Qe3 {Black can afford trades, especially if he ends up with a free bishop.  QxQe3+ is highly recommended.} Qe5 19. Be2 d4 {Nice pawn fork.} 20. Qxe4 {White sees a solution that nets a pawn.} Qxe4 21. Nxe4 Nf5 22. a4 Bg7 23. Ba3 {Oops.  Black can threaten Be2 with a pawn, while simultaneously opening a threat to Ra1. Bb2 might have been a better idea.} d3 24. Bxd3 {Probably the wrong choice.  Queen side castling sacrifices the bishop, but it is cheaper than the rook.} Bxa1 25. b4 b6 26. b5 cxb5 27. Bxb5+ Kd8 28. Bc6 Rc8 29. Bb7 Rc7 30. Bd5 Re8 31. a5 Rc1+ {What's Ba3, chopped liver?} 32. Bxc1 Re5 33. Bb7 Nh6 {RxPa5 seems like a better move.} 34. axb6 axb6 35. Ba3 Kc7 36. Ba8 Ra5 37. Bd6+ Kd7 38. Bb7 Nf5 {Pf5 means white must choose to save the knight (PxNe4) or black bishop (Kxbd6).} 39. Bf4 Ra4 40. Ke2 Nd6 {Two pieces are concentrated on Nd6.  It isn't safe there.} 41. Bxd6 f5 {Nice recovery, should have been played at move 38.} 42. d3 {This doesn't work well.  Black gets the knight and white must move her black bishop.} fxe4 43. dxe4 {Nope.  The black bishop was worth more than that pawn.} Kxd6 44. Ke3 Bd4+ 45. Kf3 Ke5 46. Bc6 Ra3+ 47. Kg2 Kf4 48. e5 {Nothing is protecting Pe5 now.} Bxe5 49. Bd7 Bd4 50. Bc6 Ra2 {Another pawn bites the dust.  This pawn would have been invisible to the bishop had it been on a white square, but at this point all black needs to do is avoid serious blunder.} 51. Kh3 Rxf2 52. Be8 Rf3+ 53. Kg2 Rf2+ 54. Kg1 Rb2+ 55. Kf1 Kf3 {The kings are aligned and white's back is against the wall.  White must move the king.} 56. Bc6+ {...or that.} Ke3 57. Ba4 Rf2+ 58. Ke1 Bc3+ 59. Kd1 Re2 60. Bb5 Rf2 61. Bc4 g5 62. Kc1 Rd2 63. Bg8 Bb2+ 64. Kb1 Ba3 {While black has pawns to spare, wasting them uselessly is unwise.  Black cannot trade bishops because they are invisible to each other.} 65. Bxh7 Ke2 66. Be4 Kd1 67. Bf3+ Ke1 68. Bg4 b5 69. Bf5 Rg2 70. Be4 Rg3 {Oh no, don't let white's king get away from the wall!} 71. Kc2 g4 72. Bf5 b4 73. Be4 b3+ 74. Kb1 Kd2 75. Bf5 Rg1# {}
