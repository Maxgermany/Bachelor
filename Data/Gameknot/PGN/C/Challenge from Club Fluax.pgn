[Black "ipsissimus (2398)"]
[Opening "Robatsch defence (A41), Rossolimo variation"]

1. e4 {I recommend to the club that we play 1. e4 due to the fact that Ispissimus is a very strong D-pawn player. } g6 {This is a surprise as I and the club were expecting 1. ...c5 or 1. ...e5. This move says that Ipsissimus is wanting to take an indirect approach to the game. While at the same time keeping his over all plan close to the chest. } 2. d4 {Naturally, white responds by staking a claim in the centre. } Bg7 3. Nf3 {Develops a Knight and defends the d4 pawn. Also the knight challenges the the black DSB for control of the central dark squares. } d6 {Black adopts the pric defense which is not a recommended system in top play. In my opinion, it is way to passive and black ends up defending the whole game. } 4. Nc3 {White on the other hand continues to develop naturally. Plus now white has a slight advantage due to his better centre, lead in development and slight edge in tempo. } c6 {Though black has wasted two tempo on pawn moves his structure is rock solid and should repel any attack by white. Even though black has nothing offensively going on his defensive capabilities make up the difference. Such is the nature of the pirc defense, all defense and no offence. } 5. Bc4 {The alternative is Be2 but the club choose this move because it hits at f7 and put the bishop on the powerful a2-g8 diagonal. On this diagonal this bishop seriously hinders black ability to free himself. I suggest that you mark this move and watch throughout the remainder of the game how this bishop continues to grow more and more powerful as the game goes on. The fact that this bishop is allowed to stay on this diagonal for so long is one of the reasons why white wins.  } Nf6 {Black has to start think about his development while at the same time keeping white's centre in check. The tactical point of Nf6 is that now black threatens ...d5 gaining back a valuable tempo from white's LSB. Which incidentally highlights the main drawback of playing bc4. That is, the White LSB can easily be attack via ...b7-b5 and ...d5.  } 6. Bb3 {White simply side steps any business that may come with ...d5 or ...b5. } O-O 7. O-O {both sides take time out to take care of king safety. At this point white's main strategical plan is to play e4-e5 with a serious wedge into the black camp. } Bg4 {I believe black main alternative is 7...d5 but that allows e4-e5 which gives white an long term advantage of space. With 7. ...Bg4 black directly deals with the threat of e4-e5 by eliminating the main catalyst of the e4-e5 push which is the F-Knight. However, black gives white the long term strategic advantage of the bishop pair. Which in the end is why white wins. } 8. h3 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 e6 {Black is quite content to sit back behind his wall of pawns and taunt white to come and get him. } 10. Rd1 {with the prospect of e4-e5 gone for at least the short term white shifts their focus to opening up the d-file. } Qc7 11. Bf4 {A strong square for the bishop that prevents black from freeing himself with ...e6-e5. While at the same time x-raying the black queen on c7. In the short term the club's plan was to constrain black as much as possible to deny him the ability to free himself. By denying black his ability to counterattack this would force him to eventually take drastic measures to get something going. However, as long as black continues to hide behind his wall of pawns there is not much white can do in the end. So all white can hope for is that black over extends or gets impatient. This is what makes systems like the pirc so hard to play because no one likes the feeling of being squeezed to death. } Nbd7 12. a4 {preventing black from freeing himself with ...b7-b5. Now the only counter play that black has is Nh5 attacking the bishop on f4. } Nh5 {As expected} 13. Be3 {A good sided minority of our club preferred Bh2 keeping the bishop on the diagonal. However, I vetoed that because the weakness on d4 must be taken seriously. Futhermore, I also foresaw that the bishop would return to the f4 diagonal with a vengeance in the near future. I also feared that the bishop may end up blocked in at h2 or worse still getting traded off the board, Be3 avoids this possible trade. } a6 14. g4 {The first serious concession by white which signals that is it is time to get it on. White has done absolutely everything they could to prepare and now is the time to push black off the board. } Nhf6 15. a5 {preventing b7-b5 and forcing black into a pure passive position for the rest of the game. The club from here on out, adopts a python like style which means slowly squeezed black to death } c5 {!? I have to be honest when I first say this move my heart skipped a beat. It is also the main reason why I played Be3 instead of Bh2. Now with the bishop on e3 d4 is securely defended. White can now make the principled response which is every wing attack should be countered in the center. Mark this move as I think it is where black starts to go down hill fast. } 16. e5 {! I have to give this an exclamation mark because it does so many things like open the centre which unleashes the bisho pair, plus open the d-file for the rook on d1 which has been sitting there patiently since move 10. } dxe5 17. d5 exd5 18. Nxd5 Nxd5 19. Qxd5 Rad8 20. Qd6 Qc8 {After a flurry of exchanges white comes out on top. Though down a pawn, white has flying bishops, control of the d-file and active pieces. Black is reduced to defense. } 21. Ba4 Nb8 {forced} 22. Qxc5 {Regaining the pawn} Nc6 23. c3 {preventing ...Nd4} Qe6 {Myself personally would find this position very difficult to play as black as there is no real clear way to progress. The point of ...Qe6 is to improve teh queen position and temporarily prevent the powerful Bb3.  However, the main alternative 23...Kh8 trying to side step the nasty pin on f7 fails to 24. Rxd8 Rxd8 25. Bb3!} 24. Qb6 {Threatening to take the b-pawn so Black has to move his queen back to the bad c8 square and allow white to play the powerful Bb3} Qc8 25. Bb3 Bf6 {Black is trying to re-energize the DSB but I think I would have played ...h5 here to just sit on my hands is not my style so I would opt to put some pressure on white. When you put pressure on your opponent you never know what can happen. } 26. Kg2 Rxd1 27. Rxd1 Rd8 28. Bd5 Kg7 {This I believe is the first real difficult choice for white. As I believe the path toward progress in not truly clear. 29. B4 may at first glance look like a good move but it has the nasty drawback of weakening c3 which if black can find find away to play e4 is suddenly under attack. } 29. b4 h5 {A great move that rips white king position open like a can opener} 30. gxh5 e4 {This is the main drawback of 29.b4. I feared that black would be able to gain much needed counter play by attacking c3. } 31. Bb3 {A more defensive move than anything else. White's most pressing problem is un coordinated pieces. } Qf5 {?! This I believe is the final nail in the coffin. During the game I was a little concerned (most of the club did not share my concern) about 31....Rxd1 32. Bxd1 Bxc3! 33. hxg6 fxg6 34. Bc2 Bxb4 and I think after a hard long look white can only manage a draw. The reason being is that most of white's trumps were in the queen side majority and bishop pair. Now after 35. Bxe4 Bc3 black has mostly freed himself of most of his weaknesses and can easily defend against attacks. However, what I do not like about 31. ...Qf5 is that it allows white to retain the bishop pair and the queen pawn majority. The short falls of this move are eloquently highlighted in the rest of this game. } 32. Rxd8 Nxd8 33. hxg6 Qxg6+ {What makes this position winning for white is the fact that the white king can seek shelter on the queen side and black does not have time to capture the critical c3-pawn. } 34. Kf1 Qf5 35. Qc7 {!! winning move. The club rightly assessed that black only has spite checks } Qxh3+ 36. Ke2 Ne6 {Black defends valiantly by centralizing his pieces. } 37. Qxb7 {The pawn advantage is retained and now it is impossible for black to hold back the upcoming pawn storm } Qf3+ {black has a last gasp attempt for a repetitive draw with the queen } 38. Kd2 {only move c3 has to be defended} Bg5 39. Kc2 {Black is going to exchange bishops on e3 in the hopes of a white slip up} Qe2+ 40. Kb1 Bxe3 41. fxe3 Qxe3 42. Bxe6 {Black goes down a full minor piece} Qd3+ 43. Kb2 {White king seeks refuge on the queen side. It is worth noting that had black played the 31...Rxd1 line white would not have had this possibility of hiding behind the pawns. Also black would have retained his knight and bishop making it almost impossible for white to win. In conclusion, White managed to nurse a small but enduring space advantage for a win. Over the course of the game white added the bishop pair and central dominance to force black to concede more time and space. The biggest take away for me is that the pirc defense is a solid defense but black is often left with no attacking resources. It is my opinion that black's final chance to draw the game came at move 31. where he should have played 31...Rxd1 leading to the capturing of the c3 and b4 pawns. This coupled with the retention of the Knight and Black bishop would have been enough to secure the draw. }
