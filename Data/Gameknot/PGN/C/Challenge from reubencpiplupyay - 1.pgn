[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Andreaschek gambit"]

1. e4 {Arguably the oldest move in the book. It's a move that has been played for centuries, by all levels of opponents and even Bobby Fisher's personal favorite. "Best by test" as he'd say it. A move befitting for a challenge match I'd say.} c5 {I decide to play the Sicilian, my bread and butter and a countermeasure to my abysmal 1. e4 e5 play. White has a lot of options, but usually goes with the quiet Nf3 before making fireworks with a d4 push in the center. I was kind of hoping for him to play 2.c3 which is the Alapin. I was hoping for this because it's arguably one of the openings I play worst against and It'd make a good practicegame.} 2. d4 {Interestingly enough my opponent chooses for the Smith Morra gambit, an opening which one of my old teachers in high school used to play. White sacrifices a pawn ( sometimes temporarily depending on what variation you decide to play ) in exchange for a faster development.} cxd4 {I was anticipating c3 to follow now as it's usually played in this position. I would probably have played some type of Scheveningen setup if that were the case with pawns on d6 and e6.} 3. Nf3 {c3 doesn't get played. This is perfectly playable for white in my opinion even though the openingdatabases seem to disagree. It'll most likely transpose into an open sicilian.} Nc6 4. Nxd4 {We successfully transposed into an open Sicilian.} Nf6 {This is not what I usually play, but I felt like testing it out. Usually I'd play e6 and go into a Taimanov/Kahn Sicilian where I lie in wait for counterattacking possibilities. The variation which I hoped we'd end up playing is called the Sveshnikov Sicilian, which is usually reached with the move order: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5! I wanted to play this Sicilian since it's one of the most dynamic Sicilians out there where black creates a bunch of weaknesses in his position in exchange for dynamic counterplay and if white doesn't know what he's doing he can get caught off guard really easily. I figured it'd make for an interesting and fun match full of tactical complications.} 5. Nxc6 {Sadly we're not going into the Sveshnikov. I think this move is an error by white and I'm not sure why he played it. Maybe he was looking at 5.Nxc6 bxc6 6.e5, but that gets met by Qa5+ simply winning a pawn. I'd have played Nc3 instead if I were white in this position.} bxc6 {Winning back my knight. dxc6 was also an option, but black loses his right to castle after the queens go off the board. The pawn on e4 is now under attack so he must play either f3, Nc3, Bd2 or a queenmove.I think Nc3 is the better one out of all those options. } 6. Nc3 d6 {A scheveningen type of set-up. I don't think it's black's best move, but I don't think it's a mistake either. It makes the development of my dark squared bishop a little bit iffy, but gives room for my light squared bishop to come and play. I'm planning on developing the dark squared bishop with a fianchetto.} 7. Bd3 g6 8. O-O Bg7 {The bishop is developed as planned. I start to wonder where I'm going to move my light squared bishop to. Maybe b7 would be nice after a c5 push, but I think that a c5 push is too early at this point of the game. The e6 square isn't really appetizing either as it doesn't put pressure on anything. It's something I'll have to think about during the next few moves. Right now castling should be my priority.} 9. Be3 {I found this interesting. It's not everyday that both bishops get developed on the 3th rank. I don't think it's bad, but it might miss a bit of ... ambition? It doesn't really put a lot of pressure on anything aside from the a7 pawn, but if his response to me moving my rook to b8 is Bxa7 then I don't think this game will go well for him at all. Both sides can develop very calmly here and there's no opening advantage for either side. Ng4 comes into mind, making use of my underdeveloped bishop for protection. It's not something that is worth it right now, but definitely something to consider in the future. I personally would have played Bg5. h6 would be met with Bh4. If black still wants to chase the bishop away with g5 after that then he effectively ruined his kingside pawnstructure making castling rather awkward. } O-O 10. Qe2 {I am not sure why Qe2 was played. If I had to take a guess then I'd say it was either played with the hopes of playing Ba6, which isn't very good since I'd just develop my bishop rather then trade it, or I could even consider Ba6 Bxa6 Qxa6 c5 after which his queen looks like a dingleberry over there, achieving nothing. The other possible reason is to shove the e4 pawn as a breaking move in the near future after he relocated his dark squared bishop, but if that was his plan then Re1 would have been slightly better in my opinion. Re1 is also the move I'd have played here if I was white.} Rb8 {Poking him a litttle. White has multiple good ways to deal with it, but choosing a wrong one can get really troublesome rather quickly.} 11. b3 {Not the best response in my opinion as it weakens the a1-h8 diagonal. His knight is now unprotected and on the same diagonal as a rook. Ideas of Qa5 come to mind. I think Rb1 was the best defence here. Bxa7 was also a possibility but after 11. Bxa7 Rxb2 white has an isolated c-pawn and my rook on the second rank can put some nice pressure.  } Ng4 {b3 is something I immediately try and take advantage of. There's only 1 correct move here for white, all the others lose material . This was played to put pressure on his bishop as well as making my bishop aim at c3. Note that playing Qa5 immediately wouldn't have worked because he could have just moved his knight.} 12. Qd2 {This move is a mistake. A move that aims to solve the issue of his knight being attacked by defending it. This however means that after Nxe3 he must reply with fxe3 creating a double pawn and a serious potential weakness. And although he's defending his knight, after Qa5 there's no way to defend it any further resulting in a loss of material. The best move for white would have been the quiet Bd2 in my opinion. It makes white's position look very meek, but it's pretty solid. If Bd2 had been played I would have played Ne5, attacking his bishop as well as just generally being a nice square for my knight. Black would have been slightly better positionally speaking. } Nxe3 {Qxe3 loses a piece so he must play fxe3} 13. fxe3 {Doubled isolated pawns, they're usually a pain in the ass to defend. I'm not quite sure how I'm going to take advantage of this positional weakness at this point, but I'm definitely going to try.} Qa5 {This wins material for black no matter what white plays. This move is the main reason why Bd2 was required.} 14. Nb1 {My opponent had the choice between losing a knight or giving his rook for my powerful bishop. He chose for the better of 2 poisons in my opinion.} Qxd2 15. Nxd2 Bxa1 {You could argue that my bishop was better then his rook and that therefore this is a bad trade. I kind of like it though. The only thing I'm sad about is that taking advantage of the weakness on e3 will be much harder now.} 16. Rxa1 {As a nice added bonus his rook is far less useful on a1 then it was on f1. Now the question for black is how to proceed from here as there aren't any super obvious moves here. I should aim to somehow take advantage of his doubled pawns, I'm not sure how just yet.} f6 {The plan is to get g5 in, play h5, etc. You can't really make a lot of progress by playing on the queenside in this position, considering he has a majority there so I opt to utilise my majority to storm his king. It weakens my king safety, but I don't think that white has enough material left to really threaten a lot.} 17. Bc4+ {An in between check, which I anticipated. It's not too bothersome for black, but It improves the position of his bishop slightly so it's definitely not a bad move. } Kg7 18. Nf3 {Trying to put his knight on a better square and maybe help in defending my upcoming pawnstorm. The rook may also look to come over to d1 in the future.} g5 19. h3 {A move to block off my advance. I'm not sure just how successful that will be though, I have no intention on playing h5 -> h4 and then blocking off my pawn advance.} h5 {Continuing the plan. Due to his earlier h3 move, I'll have to consider playing g4 as the breaking move. I'm also looking on putting my rook on the h-file at this point. Looking at this, I find it really hard to construct a plan here for white. g4 doesn't work, moving your rook is too slow, idem for moving the knight. There's just no real good way to stop my pawnstorm.} 20. h4 {Putting the question on how I want to deal with it. I like this move, there's quite some people who would just play g4 as black here without thinking in an over the board game and with that destroy a large chance of them winning as it stops their advancement. g4 is probably still winning for black, but it's a more difficult route to take in my opinion. I only considered 2 moves here, Kh6 and Bg4.} Kh6 {In the end I chose for Kh6 over Bg4. I made a few calculations after the move Bg4 and although I didn't hate what I found, I think that Kh6 is easier to play and more straightforward to play. My calculations were: 20. h4 Bg4 21. Nh2 gxh4 22. Nxg4 hxg4 23. Be6. There's no way to stop the bishop from regaining the pawn except to play g3, but that would require me to play h3 later on and give up the h3 pawn. He can prevent the h3 idea with Bh2 and destroy that pawns advancement. It would be a pain in the butt to deal with. Kh6 is simple, but after he captures on g5 I simply recapture and go from there. } 21. hxg5+ fxg5 22. Nd4 {I'm a big fan of this move. Yes it opens up the f-file, but as of right now I can't really do anything with that file. This attacks the c6 pawn and finally puts some pressure against black who's been in the driver seat all game. c5 gets met with Nc6 attacking the rook, maybe after that he can move it to a6 and continue being annoying. It's not a game-winning move, but at the very least it's a start. That being said, white does have to be carefully calculate here what follows or his knight could end up being trapped.} c5 {I looked at Bb7 for a brief moment, but realised it falls to Nf5+ losing a pawn for no compensation. I anticipate: 22. Nd4 c5 23. Nc6 Rb7. No matter what moves he makes after that, I'll likely play Rc7 chasing away his knight and solving my issues. If I'm lucky I might even be able to trade a minor piece or even win material ( although that's probably just wishful chess ). } 23. Nc6 Rb7 {We're on to a crucial move now. If he plays Ba6 then I'm pretty sure I'll win. It looks very tasty for white, but black has more then enough space to escape and probably trade a minor piece.} 24. Ba6 {This looks easy but it's not because of the a7 pawn or e7 pawn falling in variations of both Rb6 and Rc7 if played sloppily. The a7 or e7 pawn doesn't fall in 1 exact variations of Rb6 because of 24. Ba6 Rb6 25. Bxc8 Rxc6 but that gets met by 26. Bb7 and his bishop will be able to retreat to the pesky d5 square.  That being said I can deal with that by preparing an e6 push. All other variations offer far more trouble for as far as I've looked into them.} Rb6 25. Bxc8 Rxc6 26. Bd7 {I anticipated Bb7 rather then Bd7 because it'd make it easier to go to the d5 square. My response is the same regardless of wether he played Bb7 or Bd7 though.} Rc7 27. Be6 Rf6 28. Bg8 {This is a blunder. I can kind of understand why it was played, but I'd have played Bc4 here rather then Bg8. At least that way you get your bishop on a powerful diagonal, unlike Bg8 which just loses a bishop after my next move.} e6 {The bishop is now blocked and after Kg7 or Rc8 it has nowhere to go, at most he'll get a pawn for it with Bxe6. He can still delay this by playing Rf1 here, but that doesn't change a whole lot. 28. Bg8 e6 29. Rf1 Kg7 30. Rxf6 Kxf6. After that I'll move the rook on c7 to e7 and my king back to g7 to capture the bishop. Another way to delay is to play 29. e5 dxe5 30. Rd1 after which an immediate Rc8 is neccesary. He can then get his rook to the 7th rank, improving the position of his rook and probably winning the a7 pawn, but that's just not adequate compensation for the bishop.} 29. Rf1 {My opponents goes for the 29. Rf1 Kg7 30. Rxf6 Kxf6. variation it seems, I find this one worse then the variation of  29. e5 dxe5 30. Rd1 because it just leave white with a clear rook down in the endgame. With e5 you can at least prevent the trade of your rook and maybe hope to snatch a pawn or 2. Also looking back on it now, I realise that I messed up, there's a faster variation that leads to more or less the same result namely: 29. Rf1 Rxf1+ 30. Kxf1 Re7 after which the king once again moves to g7. This variation is 1 move faster and the little nuance of the white king being on f1 rather then e1 matters close to nothing so I should have played that.} Kg7 30. Rxf6 Kxf6 31. a4 Re7 32. c3 Kg7 33. Bxe6 Rxe6 {A rook up for just 1 measly pawn. This endgame is about as easy for black as you'll ever get. On top of being a rook up, white's pawns are hard to defend and the white king is nowhere near them so capturing them is rather easy.} 34. b4 cxb4 35. cxb4 Rxe4 {If Kf2 is played then I'll just get rid of the 2 pawns on the a and b-file, place my rook on the c-file and promote the pawn on the a-file. If a5 or b5 is played, I'll capture the pawn that's left on the 4th rank with the same idea. It's the fastest and easiest way to checkmate. White can more or less resign here.} 36. b5 Rxa4 {And here reuben resigned. A game well played considering and I'd definitely be up for a rematch if he ever challenges me again.}
