1. d4 e6 2. c4 f5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 b6 5. Bg5 Bb7 6. e3 Bb4 7. Qc2 O-O 8. Bd3 Qe8 9. a3 Bxc3+ 10. Qxc3 {10.bxc3 is probably better, so that White can keep control of e4.} Ne4 11. Bxe4 fxe4 12. Nd2 Qg6 13. Bh4 a5 {13...Qxg2 is probably very dangerous because of 14.O-O-O and Black's lack of defenders on the kingside.} 14. Bg3 Na6 15. Qc2 Rac8 16. Qb3 Kh8 17. c5 Bd5 18. Qb5 {I missed this threat.   It wins a pawn, but Black still has decent play, I think.} Rca8 {I actually considered playing 18...bxc5 here instead.} 19. cxb6 Bc6 20. Qxa5 Rf5 21. Qc3 cxb6 22. Nc4 Bb5 23. Nxb6 {I think White had a few better options here: 23.a4, 23.Nd6 or 23.Ne5. } Qg4 24. Qc2 {24.f3 doesn't seem to work either.} Nb4 25. Qd2 Nd3+ 26. Kf1 Raf8 27. Kg1 Nxf2 28.
