[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B10)"]

1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kann is my favourite defense.} 2. e5 d6 {I believe this is the best response to White's slightly uncommon 2nd move.} 3. f4 {Dubious move, probably armed against the King Knight's development. 2.ed is the standard move.} Nh6 {Continuing development.} 4. h3 {Another dubious move, weakening the Kingside.} Nf5 {Instead of continuing the development with 4-g6, it is more important to immediately take advantage of White's weak 4th move.} 5. Nc3 Ng3 6. Rh2 g6 7. Nge2 Nxf1 8. Kxf1 dxe5 9. d3 {A pawn sac, but for what? 9.fe was much better, when I would have replied 9-c5, retaining a slight edge.} Bg7 10. Be3 O-O 11. g4 {A big mistake, further weakening the Kingside. Essential was 11.fe - Be5, 12. g3, when 12-Na6 would retain my advantage.} f5 {The winning move, breaking through the Kingside.} 12. g5 exf4 13. Bxf4 e5 14. Be3 Nd7 {The imprudent 14-f4 would have been answered by 15.Bc5.} 15. d4 {Another error, unnecessarily opening up the game, thereby hastening defeat. 15.Bd2 was necessary.} f4 {Of course! Now there's no defense.} 16. Bf2 Nb6 {It's more important to activate all my pieces than to win a Pawn.} 17. h4 {Holding on to the g-pawn creates a new weakness at g4. Much better was 17.de - f3, 18.Ng3 - Be5, 19.Qd8 - Rd8, prolonging the game.} Nc4 18. dxe5 {18.Kg1 - Bg4, 19. Qd3 would have offered more resistance. Although after 19-Nb2, it wouldn't be too hard to crash through White's position.} Nd2+ 19. Kg2 {19.Kg1 offers more resistance, as in 19-Nf3 , 20.Kh1 - Nh2, 21.Kh2. However, Black still wins by 21-Be5.} Bg4 {This is much better than the win of a piece by 19-f3 , which would have slowed down my attack after 20.Kh1 - fe2, 21.Qe2 - Nf3, 22.Rg2.} 20. Ne4 {A piece blunder, when I was expecting 20.Kg1. In correspondence chess, a drop of a piece for nothing is unpardonable.} Nxe4 {White should resign now.} 21. Qxd8 Raxd8 22. Nc3 f3+ 23. Kf1 {The more 'tenacious' 23.Kg1 would lose to 23-Nc3, 24.bc3 - Be5.} Nxc3 24. bxc3 Bxe5 25. Bxa7 {The final blunder. 25.Rh1 - Be6, 26.h5 would have prolonged the game for White, but it's lost anyway. White resigned.}
