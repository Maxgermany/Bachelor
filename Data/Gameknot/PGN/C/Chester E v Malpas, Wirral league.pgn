1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {So far a very standard opening - the Open Sicilian} 6. h3 {But this move is very unusual, and for good reason. In an open position like this, white can't afford to waste moves like this.} e5 {So I strike out in the centre. My d pawn is backward on a semi-open file, and can potentially be attacked by his rooks and queen along the d semi-open d file. But in return black gains a measure of central control.} 7. Nde2 {I don't think this is the best square to put the knight.} Be7 {So I carry on with my development} 8. Ng3 {So this is his plan. The e pawn is protected by his Ng3 so he can play Nc3-d5 and he can also play Bc1-e3 without fear of me playing Nf6-g4 in reply. The downside is that he has wasted so many moves with his knight now at g3. Black is ahead in development.} O-O {So I continue to develop} 9. Bc4 {He takes control of the d5 square.} a6 {So I prepare to hit his bishop} 10. a3 {He prepares a retreat square} b5 {I ht the bishop} 11. Ba2 {He retreats} Be6 {I contest the a2-g8 diagonal} 12. Nd5 {He throws the knight in. Now I have to be careful. I want to play Nc6-a5-c4, but Na5 immediately loses to Be6-b6, which is one reason for my next move, to cover the b6 square again} Rc8 13. Be3 {Now I have to be careful. I want to play Nc6-a5-c4, but Na5 immediately loses to Be6-b6, which is one reason for my next move, to cover the b6 square again} Nd7 14. c3 Na5 15. O-O Nc4 16. Qe2 {Now he can't recapture on d5 with a piece, so I can exchange on d5 and my weakness on d6 is shielded by a pawn on d5.} Bxd5 {So I take} 17. exd5 {He takes back} f5 {And this is another benefit of exchanging on d5, my f5 pawn is free to advance, and I am threatening f5-f4} 18. f4 {He blocks that move. Now after the game I was thinking I should play 18....g7-g5 immediately. What do you think dear reader?} Bh4 {This is the move I actually played, which is also very strong} 19. Nh1 {This is a dreadful square for that wandering knight!} g5 {So I continue} 20. fxe5 {He takes} Nxe3 {I take} 21. Qxe3 {He takes back} f4 {I hit the queen again} 22. Qd4 {His queen has to move} dxe5 {I hit the queen again} 23. Qe4 {Queen moves} Qb6+ {I throw in a check} 24. Nf2 {Knight blocks} Rce8 {And now I am all ready to hit his queen with my knight and start my pawns rolling} 25. Qe2 {But he moves his queen first} e4 {So I just advance} 26. Kh1 {He breaks the pin on his knight} f3 {I advance again. If he takes on f3, I take back with the pawn and the knight on f2 is dropping, for instance, if he then plays Qe2-d2 or Qe2-c2 I have Re8-e2. He has to keep his queen protecting f2, and Qd2 or Qe1 runs into e4-e3, so his only move is.....} 27. Qc2 {This... and now I open up his king a little} fxg2+ 28. Kxg2 Qe3 {With a horrible threat of Qe3-g3 which drives his king back to h1, and then I can take his knight on f2, so he has only one defence to this} 29. Nh1 {The knight returns to this dreaful square} Rf3 {With a threat to his h pawn. White is lost} 30. Rxf3 {He takes} exf3+ {I take back} 31. Kf1 {King moves. Now at first I was going to play Qe2+ 32.	Qxe2	fxe2+ 33.	Kg2	e1=Q 34.	Rxe1	Rxe1 with an easily won ending, but then I stopped something even better...} Qe1+ {White resigns, because if Rxe1, Rxe1 mate! Many thanks for reading, please rate this game on the star system and leave a comment or two, let me know how I going on...}
