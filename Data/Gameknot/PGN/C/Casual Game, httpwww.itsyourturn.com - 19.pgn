1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. a4 {The line that I know for white is to play 6. a3, 7. b4 with Bb2 to follow.   Since white didn't play this line, this determines Black's next move. } a6 {Minuscule better than Bd7.  The idea is that White is going to have a harder time protecting D pawn, so he would like to be able to play 7. Bb5, even though I normally dislike Bb5 against the french. } 7. Bd3 cxd4 8. cxd4 Bd7 9. O-O {9. Bc2 is better. } Nxd4 {Only gives black a tiny advantage according to computer analysis.   So what is White's compensation? } 10. Be3 {Black has no problem dealing with this. } Nxf3+ 11. Qxf3 Qxb2 12. Nd2 { } Qxe5 13. Rfe1 {13. Bf4 Qd4 14. Nb3 Qb4 15. Rab1 Qxa4 16. Be5 b5 was a little better. } Bd6 14. Qg4 {14. g3 Qf6 was necessary. } Qxh2+ 15. Kf1 h5 16. Qf3 {16. Qxg7? Be5 17. Qg5 Bxa1 18. Rxa1?? Qh1+ } Ne7 {With the idea of 17. ... e5! 16... Nf6?! 17. Ke2 e5 18. Bf5 16... Bc6?! 17. Bd4 16... e5?! 17. Qxd5 Rd8 18. Bc4 Be6 (18... Nh6 19. Bxh6) 19. Qxb7 } 17. Ke2 e5 18. Reh1 Qxh1 {A major blunder.  Black needed to play 18. ... e4! } 19. Rxh1 {No good now is Bg4 because of Qxg4. } e4 {With this  move, white's advantage is tiny. } 20. Nxe4 dxe4 21. Bxe4 { } Bxa4 22. Bxb7 {Black gets just enough counter play to matter. 22. Rxh5 is the better choice. } Bb5+ 23. Ke1 Rd8 {Or Rb8. } 24. Qe4 g6 {=+ } 25. Bd4 {Disaster.  5. Bxa6 Bc6 (25... Bxa6 26. Qa4+) 26. Qc2 } Bb4+ 26. Kd1 Bc5 {Or Bc3. } 27. Kc2 Rxd4 28. Qe5 Rc4+ {With many tactical possibilities coming up. } 29. Kb3 O-O 30. g4 { } Rd8 {Simple but effective. } 31. Rh3 a5 {With the idea of 32. ... Rd2 and 33. ... a4 mate.  Black could have also played 31. ... Rd2 or Rdd4. } 32. gxh5 {32. Qe1 was better. } Rd2 33. hxg6 {33. Qxc5 Rxc5 } a4# {}
