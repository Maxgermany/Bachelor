1. d4 {This game is annotated with my thoughts as I was deciding on each and every move. Annotations are unedited notes I took along the way. All comments are most welcome.} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Nf3 Nf6 {I was deciding between 5...Nf6 and 5...Nc6, and in the end chose 5...Nf6 to block the move e4 a get one move closer to castling. I also noticed that it lets me answer 6.dxc5 with 6...Bxc5.} 6. Bg5 Be6 {I made a mistake moving 5...Nf6. I should have played 5...Nc6 to be able to move ...d4 if needed. Now the d pawn was threatened (7.Bxf6 Qxf6 8.Nxd5), so I had to defend it. At least there is no Ng5 threat, because the g5 square is occupied.} 7. e4 Be7 {The threat is 8.e5 and I have to prevent it. Counterattacking via 7...cxd4 is weak after 8.Qxd4 Nc6 9.Bb5 and e5 is still a threat and white’s pieces are much more active. If 7...dxe4 then 8.Nxe4 Be7 (my pawn structure on the kingside is threatened) 9.Bxf6 Bxf6 10.Nxc5 and the threats are: capturing on e6, capturing on b7, I am a pawn down, and the c5 knight is very strong. After 7...Be7 if 8.e5 then 8...Nfd7 is good for me (I increase protection of the c pawn, the position will not open up suddenly, etc.). So probably 9.exd5 Nxd5. Then 9.Nxd5 Bxg5 (9...Bxd5 10.Qe2 is uncomfortable, because I cannot castle) or 9.Bxe7 Qxe7 or 9.dxc5 Bxg5. I am definitely worse and after a check on b5 I will end up with a weak c pawn, but this is the price I pay for the mistake on the 5th move.} 8. Bb5+ Nc6 {I cannot leave the d pawn without queen’s protection, so this is the only move. I am afraid of 9.Qa4 and I will likely need to give up a pawn after subsequent Bxc6 and Qxc6, but I hope that after ...Rc8 I will have compensation. I will then try to open up the position as quickly as possible (my plan after 9.Qa4 is 9...0-0).} 9. e5 Nd7 {The only possibility is moving the knight away, but where to? 9...Nh5 loses after 10.g4. 9...Ng4 is tempting, but after 10.Bf4 and 11.h3 the knight needs to escape to h6, and this is bad for me. 9...Ne4 weakens my center too much (10.Nxe4 dxe4 11.Bxe7 Qxe7 12.Nd2 and I cannot save the pawn, while the knight at e4 will have a nice outpost). So only 9...Nd7 remains, but this move is actually quite nice: defends c5, attacks e5, and breaks the pin on the c6 knight.} 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 {After 10...Nxd7 I did not like 11.dxc5 0-0 (to be able to recapture on c5) 12.b4! and white has a pawn majority on the queenside and quite a lot of space there, too (not to mention the pawn, because it’s not going to be easy to get to the e5 pawn). Now I can also lose a pawn (11.Qa4 0-0 12.Bxc6 bxc6 13.Qxc6), but at least I have some compensation (open b and c files).} 11. dxc5 Qxc5 {I have to capture (otherwise I will face for example 12.Bxc6 bxc6 13.b4), but capturing with the knight does not work: 11...Nxc5 12.Nxd5 Bxd5 13.Qxd5 and I am much worse. If Bxc6 then my plan is bxc6 (defends the d pawn and makes ...c5 a possibility). I’d like to finally castle. I have also analyzed 12.Rc1, but it does not threaten anything (the b5 bishop is attacked), so I can then also safely castle. If 12.Ng5 then either 12...0-0 or even 12...Ndxe5. I am also thinking about ...d4 to open up the diagonal for the e6 bishop and attack the defender of the b5 bishop (but it does not work after, for example, 12.Rc1).} 12. O-O O-O {A natural move, but I also considered 12...d4 (looking for a tactic based on attacked e5 pawn and the fact that the b5 bishop is only defended by the c3 knight), but after 13.Bxc6 (forced) dxc3 (the only way to make something out of the idea) 14.Bxd7+ Bxd7 15.bxc3 I am worse: I lost a pawn, and if I try to get it back after 15...Qxc3 then after 16.Rc1 I am afraid of heavy pieces’ activity down the c and d files. I have also considered 12...Rc1 (so that after 13.Bxc6 I can recapture by ...Rxc6), but I’d like to finally break the pin of my knights against my king, and also after 13.Bxc6 Rxc6 14.Na4 the queen is somehow uncomfortably placed.} 13. Bxc6 bxc6 {13...Qxc6 was an alternative, but it leads to an unpleasant defensive task after 14.Nd4 Qc8 15.f4 Nb6 16.f5 with an attack on my king. I don’t think I stand any chance in this position. Now everything revolves around the ...c5 move. If I get to play it, I will have counterchances. If not, I will need to passively defend with little chance of succeeding. What is likely coming is 14.Nd4, when I want to play 14...Qb6 preventing 15.f4 (15...c5 16.f5? cxd4).} 14. Rc1 Bg4 {Found after a long think. I have planned 14...Qe7 (I liked 14...Rb8 better, but after 15.Nd4 it’s difficult to move queen so as not to lose the c6 pawn) and then 15...Rb8 or 15...c5. But I did not know what to do after 15.Nd4 c5 16.Nxe6. Should I capture with the queen or the pawn? In any case, I make it possible for the black f pawn to move forward, and this is good for White. This last observation made me notice the move I actually played. I am threatening the e pawn. My queen is safe (15.Ne4 Qe7; 15.Na4 Qb5 16.Nd4 Bxd1 17.Nxb5 cxb5 and I win). So White will need to play Re1 sooner or later and then I can play ...Rfe8. This gives me more activity than I have right now and does not prevent the ...c5 plan.} 15. Re1 Rfe8 {According to the plan I keep on attacking the e pawn that became a weakness. I was mostly worried about 16.Ne4 to which I was thinking about 16...Qe7? 17.Nd6 and it looks bad, but then I realized that 16...Qe7 drops the c pawn, so I need to play 16...Qb6, but this is good for me, because after 17.Nd6 I can play 17...Rxe5 when the knight loses its support. I don’t see how White can defend the e pawn now, so likely the best option at his disposal is 16.e6 when I plan to play 16...Rxe6 and perhaps after 17.Rxe6 something like 17...fxe6!?} 16. Ne4 Qb6 {Looks like the only move. I have also considered 16...dxe4 17.Rxc5 (17.Qxd7 Bxd7) Nxc5 18.Qc2 and I don’t get sufficient compensation. Other queen moves were bad (e.g., 16...Qb5 17.Nd6; 16...Qb4 17.Qd2!).} 17. Nd6 Rxe5 {The d6 knight is threatened (has no safe square to move to). (1) 18.Rxe5 Nxe5 19.h3 Bxf3 20.gxf3 g6 planning ...Rd8 (2) 18.Nxe5 Bxd1 19.Nxd7 Qc7 should win. For a while I thought about sacrificing the exchange 17...Nxe5 18.Nxe8 Rxe8, but after analyzing a few possible variations I concluded my back rank is too weak to get into such a position. I have also considered 17...Re6 (threatening to capture on e5 and then take the knight), but after 18.h3 Bxf3 19.Qxf3 Nxe5 and then for example 20.Qh5 I did not see a good continuation. Writing these notes down I also noticed that 19...Nxe5 is not even obvious, because 20.Rxe5 has to be considered.} 18. Qd3 Rxe1+ {I spent a long time thinking on this move. I considered 18...Re6, but this loses after 19.Ng5 that threatens mate and attacks the rook. 18...Qxb2 looks interesting, but after 19.Nd4 my pieces lose coordination and White’s pieces attack my weaknesses (even 19.Rxc6 is possible). 18...Nc5 was tempting, but after 19.Qc3 I don’t have a good square for the knight (plus during calculations I hallucinated and thought after 19.Qe3 I don’t have the time to capture on f3 because of a back-rank mate, not seeing that the rook is still on e5). This left me with either the game move or 18...Bxf3 first. I did not see a big difference and the rook on e5 does not stand well, so I exchanged rooks first. I also hoped for some ...Nc5 afterwards, but now, when writing this, I see this was a hallucination, again (now Qe3 is really dangerous).} 19. Rxe1 Bxf3 {I don’t want to let the knight move to d4 or g5; my bishop is definitely the worse piece. After the exchange I am a pawn up with a bit of White’s activity on the kingside, but I think I can compensate for that. My plan (after 20.Qxf3) is to play 20...Nf6. I’m not afraid of 21.Re7, because I can play 21...Qd8 and win. I can then plan ...Ne4 (attacking f2), capturing on b2, pushing the d and c pawns, ...Rd8, and ...g6 (e.g., 21.Nf5 g6 and if 22.Qg3 then 22...Ne4). I think my position is better, because White’s only plan is kingside attack, and I should be able to defend. Instead, I have a lot of possibilities.  Already after making my move I noticed the interesting possibility 19...Qb4! and after a quick analysis I got convinced this was winning: there is no way to simultaneously defend the e1 rook and the d6 knight, and there is no counterattack in sight. After this discovery I no longer have the heart for this game... } 20. Qxf3 Nf6 {The threat was Qxf7+ with a quick mate and moves 20...Rf8 and even more so 20...f6 do not look appetizing. I can now think about ...Ne4 (attacking f2), ...Qxb2, ...Rd8, maybe ...g6.} 21. b3 Qb4 {The same move that I noticed too late on the 19th move wins. 21.Nf5 was necessary (and this is what I expected). My back rank is sufficiently protected (in case of 22.Qe2) and White has no way of saving both the rook and the knight.}
