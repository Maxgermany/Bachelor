[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {In this game my many early mistakes were overcome, while my opponent's late mistake proved fatal.  My opening was actually very well put together.} e6 2. e4 {at this point im thinking about getting one of those center pawns to the 5th rank} Bb4+ {check} 3. c3 {back the truck up buddy} Ba5 4. e5 {5th rank and the great wall is complete} Nc6 {right about here I started thinking about possibilities on that wide open kingside...} 5. Qg4 {thought #1 trap that rook in the corner} Kf8 {Kf8 ends that thought... but opens up fork possibilities and a lot of them.  pretty far off though.  Right here i think black should have played g6.} 6. Nf3 {thought #2: get that knight to f7} d5 {not worried about that move, but it frees black queen a bit} 7. Qf4 {pressure on f7} Bb6 {? couldnt figure this out except maybe give knight a way out...} 8. Ng5 {meanwhile im setting up this fork and its going swell...} h6 {black threatens the knight i want to move anyways...  unfortunately im about to get greedy and make my first mistake...  let me just admire my handywork setting this up before i move to 9.} 9. Nxe6+ {so with two forking possibilities i got greedy and went for the queen, and didnt see the bishop.  should have went Nxf7} Bxe6 10. Bd3 {with that idea over i need to develop some pieces} a6 11. O-O {safely stowed away, king and pawns dont move again all game.  } f5 {with this move he had fairly good position on me...} 12. Bxf5 {so i figured i would make the exchange - bishop for bishop and i gain a pawn} Bxf5 13. Qxf5+ Nf6 14. b3 {thinking Ba3 in future...} Nxd4 {but he baits me into this one...} 15. cxd4 {and i took it} Bxd4 {Forked me, but i have some tricks up my sleeve... good thing i set up that check - Ba3} 16. Ba3+ c5 17. Bxc5+ {rather lose bishop than rook} Bxc5 18. Nc3 Bd4 {now my knight is forked but rook comes to the rescue} 19. Rac1 Rc8 {he's putting a lot of pressure on c3, and i cant combat it so i figure if i lose my knight he's losing his.  i start the exchange again} 20. exf6 {this also positions my pawn on the 6th rank which is very important in the end} Bxc3 {he should have grabbed that pawn, Bf6.  now bishop is pinned to his rook, but more importantly that space c8.  Not often i care about getting a space as much as this  if that bishop moves i have this game,} 21. Rfe1 {so i set the bait} Bxe1 {and he took it, my heart was jumping right here!  i knew i was in good shape!} 22. Rxc8 {queen is pinned to king.  and rook is protected by queen.  either way i get his queen... possibly i get his queen and rook while losing that rook a few moves ago.  pretty good turn around.} g6 {not a threat} 23. Qe6 Ba5 {no problem.} 24. Qd7 {protect my rook and threaten the queens space} d4 25. Rxd8+ {ok start the fun} Bxd8 26. Qxd8+ {woohoo! i get the rook too} Kf7 27. Qxh8 {and protect that all important pawn} Ke6 28. Qd8 {again protect my advanced pawn, but also take care of his pawn} Ke5 29. f7 d3 30. f8=Q {just a matter of time now} d2 {futile, but one mistake from stealing this back} 31. Qfe8+ Kf4 32. Qd4+ Kg5 33. Qee5# {matey,   game was full of mistakes and fortunate turns}
