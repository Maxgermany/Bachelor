1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 e5 {White opened with King's pawn and I responded with Nc3.} 3. Qg4 Nxd4 {White moved out queen to g4 which threatened my d7 and g7 pawns.

Kd1 f6 {White king moves out of check and I develop f7 pawn threatening LB at g5.} 6. Bxf6 Nxf6 {DB captures my pawn and I retake with g knight and also now threatening queen.} 7. Qxg7 d5 {White queen ignores my threat and slides down to take my g7 pawn which was unprotected.  Other captures seem likely including my h1 rook.  I move out my d7 pawn to make room for my LB and queen to  try to thwart the white queen.} 8. Qxh8+ Bf8 {White queen captures h1 rook and I bring down DB to f8 to protect king. The only thing the queen can take is pawn at h7 which is protected by my knight at NF3.} 9. exd5 Qe7 {White realises that my f knight is busy and will be unable to retake as it takes my d5 pawn.  I bring my queen out to offer protection to the knight and try to contain the queen and hope to capture.} 10. Nh3 Nxd5 {G knight moves to h3 and black f knight sees a chance to capture the pawn at d5.  This gives black the centre.} 11. Bd3 Be6 {White's LB moves to d3.  I move my LB to e6 developing and protecting d knight.} 12. Qxe5 Bg4+ {White queen captures unprotected pawn at e5 and I move LB to check king at g4 which could lead to exchange of queens.} 13. f3 Qxe5 {Pawn stops check with f3 move.  I now take the queen.} 14. Re1 Ne3+ {White moves h8 rook to e8 and I respond by placing my knight on e3 checking king.} 15. Kd2 Be6 {King moves out of check and I move my LB back to e6 to prevent capture by f3 pawn.} 16. Bxh7 O-O-O {White's LB captures pawn at h7 and I long castle.} 17. Rxe3 Qa5+ {White moves e knight down the e file and I move queen across to a5 and check the king.} 18. Rc3 Bh6+ {White moves e rook to c3 to protect king and I  move DB to h6 and recheck king.} 19.

Kg3 {King moves out of check and my LB captures knight to remove this piece to give me a better chance of continuing my mating threat.} Bxh3 22. Kxh3 Qe6+ {Once again I mate the king following his capture of my DB.} 23. g4 Bf4 24. Na3 Qh6+ {White's g3 pawn moves to protect the king and I move my bishop up to f4.

Kf1 Qxh7 {King moves out of check and I take the time to capture black's LB at h7.} 27. Re1 Qh1+ {My queen goes up to check king again at h1 who now has the a1 rook at his side on e1.} 28. Kf2 Qh4+ {King moves onto f2 leaving me free to capture the rook but I would risk the queen's capture if I was to take the rook so I move along the h file to h4.} 29. Kf1 Rh8 {King moves back to f1 and I move d rook over to h8 to complete the task. } 30. Re4 Qh1+ {As I am now threatening the rook white decides to move this perhaps thinking this may be wise as he had a close shave before.  I now move my queen down to h1 again to check the king.} 31. Kf2 Rh2# {King moves out of check and I move down h8 rook to make checkmate. }
