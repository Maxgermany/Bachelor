1. Nf3 {My favorite opening} b6 {Moving out his pawn...} 2. Nc3 {I bring out my other knight (notice that as it approaches the endgame, those knights come in super handy)} a5 {Moving out his farthest pawn... not the best opening moves. Better to try and gain control of the middle board instead.} 3. e4 {Gaining control of the middle board} e6 {He responds, probably intending to move the pawn on d two spaces.} 4. d3 {Protecting my outmost pawn} Nc6 {Moving out the knight} 5. Bg5 {Threatening the queen} f6 {Protecting the queen} 6. Bf4 {Moving the bishop out of danger} Nb4 {Moving his knight; there is no point to this move, and I can easily deflect it...} 7. a3 {...like so. Now he is forced to move the knight again or else lose it. } h5 {Does not move the knight, but instead does this pawn maneuver. This was one of Black's biggest mistakes in the game. After this, he was basically just responding to my attacks instead of making his own moves.} 8. Be2 {Moving out my other bishop to threaten the h pawn} a4 {Moving his pawn forward... not sure why.} 9. Nd4 {Bringing my other knight out into play} g5 {Threatening my bishop.} 10. Bd2 {Moving my bishop away} h4 {I go on the offensive.} 11. axb4 {Taking the knight} Bxb4 {Taking my pawn} 12. Bh5+ {Putting Black in check} Ke7 {Moving out of check} 13. Nce2 {Threatening his bishop} c5 {Threatening my knight} 14. Bxb4 {Taking the bishop} Rxh5 {He takes my bishop} 15. Bc3 {Moving my bishop away so he can't take it... if he moves cxd4, I can take the pawn. But instead...} h3 {...moving the pawn forward (again). Not the smartest move. } 16. Ng3 {Threatening the rook} hxg2 {Taking my pawn} 17. Rg1 {Blocking the pawn; I can now take it at my leisure.} Rxh2 {Taking my pawn.} 18. Nf3 {Threatening the rook. At this point, Black makes another crucial mistake.} g4 {Black does not see that the rook is in danger and instead tries to threaten my knight. Now I am free to take the rook.} 19. Nxh2 {I take the rook.} f5 {Moving the other pawn forward.} 20. exf5 {I take the pawn} Bb7 {Instead of responding like I'd expected him to, he instead tries to protect the g pawn (pointless, because it is trapped and I can easily add more pieces to threaten it.)} 21. fxe6 {I take the other pawn.} dxe6 {He takes my pawn.} 22. Nxg4 {I take the unprotected pawn.} Nf6 {He moves his knight to try and threaten mine, effectively killing the knight and queen in one move.} 23. Bxf6+ {Taking the knight and putting him in check} Ke8 {Moving out of check} 24. Bxd8 {Taking the queen} Kxd8 {He takes the bishop} 25. Ne3 {Adding extra threat to the pawn} Kd7 {Trying to open a path for the rook} 26. Nxg2 {I take the pawn} Rf8 {Moving the rook into play.} 27. Qe2 {Providing some extra protection for my pawn on f.} Bf3 {Threatening my queen} 28. Qe3 {Moving the queen out of danger} Bd5 {Apparently, Black thought that I would try to take the bishop, which was protected by the rook. I believe it is due to not seeing the entire board, which is a mistake I used to make.} 29. Nf4 {Thinking to take the bishop in exchange for the knight, but also threatening the pawn.} Bc6 {Moving the bishop away} 30. Qxe6+ {Putting him in check} Kc7 {Moving out of check} 31. Qe7+ {Putting him in check again and preparing to take the rook.} Bd7 {Protecting the king} 32. Qxf8 {I take the rook} a3 {Not a very smart move for black; probably he was intending to try and promote it but he forgot to protect it first.} 33. Rxa3 {Taking the pawn and opening a path for my rook.} b5 {Moving the other pawn forward, which wasn't the smartest move.} 34. Qxc5+ {Taking the pawn and putting him in check.} Kd8 {Moving out of check.} 35. Ra8+ {Putting him in check} Bc8 {Only move} 36. Qxc8+ {Taking the bishop} Ke7 {Moving out of check} 37. Nf5+ {I didn't see the checkmate earlier; if I had moved Qe6, it would have been mate, but I moved here instead. } Kf6 {Moving out of check} 38. Qe6# {Mate.}
