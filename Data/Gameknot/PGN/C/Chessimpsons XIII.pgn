1. e4 e5 2. d4 {queens pawn sacrafice } exd4 {this is a sacrafice to gain development} 3. Nf3 {continuing development} Nc6 4. c3 dxc3 5. Bc4 {queens side pawns are sacrificed to gain advantage on the kings side} cxb2 6. Bxb2 Bb4+ {this check is expected} 7. Nc3 Qe7 {however the knight is pinned leaving e4 vunerable} 8. O-O {the plan is to get control of the e-file} Nf6 9. Re1 {his queen is not in a good position} O-O {castle to protect the queens position} 10. e5 {press for an advantage on the e-file} Ng4 11. Nd5 {press an attack} Qd8 {his queen has limited abilities } 12. Re4 {this move was premature but black must be concerned with the middle now} d6 {attacks my advanced pawn and opens up the white diagonal for his bishop} 13. a3 {this was a mistake as his bishop doesnt threaten anything at its ucrrent position} Bc5 {now its in a better position } 14. h3 {? ? - i should have lost the game here - knight to f2 forks the queen and rook} Ngxe5 {? ? he missed it - he wont miss another one} 15. Nxe5 {i gladly trade my inactive knight for his which is in an aggressive position} dxe5 {now im in the middle game three pawns down but in a slightly superior middle position} 16. Qf3 Be6 {good defense ant attack at the same time - i need to get busy now or my opponent will exploit his material advantage} 17. Bxe5 Bxd5 {black is now in position to increase his material advantage} 18. Bxd5 Qxd5 {and he does - my position advantage is evaporating and a strong opponent has a material advantage on me which he is very capable of exploiting} 19. Bxg7 {if he take the bishop i may have a winning continuation} Rfd8 20. Qg4 {he does of course see the possibility of a very nasty discovered check} f5 {! the best defense is a good offense} 21. Qg3 {looks bad now but his king is in a bad position if i can exploit it} Qxe4 {?? so wrong, i thought he would take with the pawn} 22. Bc3+ {i see now i can mate him - } Kf7 {forced - as i have the long dark diagonal} 23. Re1 {! i now have two files and a diagonal around his exposed king} Qd5 24. Qg7# {and mate - whew! }
