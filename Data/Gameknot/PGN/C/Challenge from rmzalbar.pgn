1. g3 b5 2. Bg2 {Danger! Protect your rooks. A good move would have been pawn to c6, especially queen-side where you are not as likely to want to castle.} Na6 {Wide open.} 3. Bxa8 {...} c6 {HEY!!  YOU'VE TRAPPED MY BISHOP! devious.} 4. Nf3 {I move my knight to fill the hole in my line, control the center of the board, and open the way for castling.} Nf6 {Copycat.} 5. O-O {Castle! My king is in his castle. My rook is in danger from your bishop c8 though.} g6 {miau.} 6. b3 {let's get my other bishop out..} d6 {Bad idea! my bishop is no longer trapped. He can kill your pawn, threaten your king, and escape, twirling his mustache!} 7. Bb2 {..but I suck, I confused the king and queen, so thought it wouldn't work and advanced my other bishop instead. More firepower aimed at the center of the board, and your other rook.} Nd7 {OH NO YOU DIDN'T. you did.} 8. Bxh8 {Your king has no castle.} Nb6 {You threaten my bishop. Do I notice?} 9. Nd4 {I do not.} Nxa8 {:(} 10. Nxc6 {I think I noticed my mistake... here. Queencheck!} Qd7 {RUN AWAY!} 11. Nd4 {RUN.. AWAY...} Bb7 {Bishop gets dangerous.} 12. f3 {I get nervous about defense. Make my king some room to maneuver.} f6 {miau?} 13. c3 {I'm letting my queen loose..} Bd5 14. a4 {Pawn clearing the way for my rook to charge in..} Na8c7 15. axb5 Nb8 16. Rxa7 {Horseys have fled, but I can still apply pressure.} Bh6 17. b6 {Oh you are in trouble now. Either you lose a knight or a queen.} Kd8 18. bxc7+ {Guess it's just a knight :( Czech.} Qxc7 19. Rxc7 {OH NO, YOU DIDN'T. Guess it's a knight AND a queen. You should have retreated your king! i couldn't have advanced the pawn without losing my rook. A fair trade (for me.)} Kxc7 20. c4 Bc6 21.
