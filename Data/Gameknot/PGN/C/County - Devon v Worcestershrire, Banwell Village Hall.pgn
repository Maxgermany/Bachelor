1. d4 {My 18th black in my last 20 OTB games.... County Knockout stage Q/F  (unfortunately my Worcestershire team lost the match) Pleased to finish my role as Captain with a win for the team...} e6 {Giving him the option to transpose into a French.} 2. c4 f5 {I stick with a Dutch which I've done okay with this year.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 { } 5. e3 c6 {Preparing d5 (more common is (0-0)} 6. Bd3 d5 7. f3 {Not seen this played here but it seems logical since black nearly always tries to place a Knight on e4 in this opening. This also prepares for e4.} O-O 8. Qc2 {Giving extra support to e4 and perhaps eyeing up a later g4?} Na6 {Not too sure if this was a good idea, had the idea of Nb4 and possibly Qa5 in response to a3.... but realised that after Rc1 my Queen and Knight would be badly placed.} 9. a3 {as expected, stopping Nb4} Nc7 {So the Knight has to find another destination.} 10. Nge2 {He develops his final minor piece . . .} Bd7 {. . . so I do the same.} 11. O-O {Shredder has this about equal.} Nce8 {Eyeing up the d6 square.} 12. e4 {White is now slightly better according to Shredder  (+0.69) } fxe4 {I had a few options here but felt that opening the f file would be good in the long term and will also make the g4 square available for my Knight.  } 13. fxe4 {He recaptures and score is now (White +0.97) probably due to my unusual Knight manoeuvres? } dxc4 {I decide to take on c4 to deflect his Bishop from d3 and so that I gain a tempo when I recapture...} 14. Bxc4 Nd6 15. Bd3 {Bishop rejoins the b1 - h7 diagonal with the Queen and now white threatens e5.} Ng4 {So moving my Knight to g4 as planned seemed like the best option.  (Shredder also likes this move)} 16. Rxf8+ {I expected him to play Bxe7 but he had other ideas . . .} Qxf8 {I recapture with my Queen but still think my position is too passive.   I was thinking I will need to play . . . e5 at some stage giving up a Pawn but blocking the diagonal with his Q & B.  Hopefully then regaining the Pawn later?)} 17. Rf1 {What do we think of this move and the position now?! . . . after his Rf1 move attacking my Queen....  I thought for several minutes about my next move to make sure it was sound.  Can you guess black's move?} Bxg5 {After some thought I decided to give up my Queen because I was confident there must be a forced win....  I could not see a defense for him after taking his Bishop, which forces . .} 18. Rxf8+ {. . . Him to take my Queen . . . Shredder now has me way ahead (-5.21) } Rxf8 {I recapture with my Rook and suddenly my pieces have moved in for the finish!   Nothing White can do here to avoid mate or heavy material loss. (Nf4 may delay things)?} 19. g3 {Giving his King an extra square.  (He said he had considered Nd1 but that loses quickly to Ne3+) When I gave up the Queen I felt I had the insurance of a position like this cropping up where I could restore the material balance with Rf1+ followed by Ne3+ but this would not be winning so instead I quickly played . .} Be3+ { } 20. Kg2 {(Kh1 would be met by Rf1, forcing him to g2 anyway, since Ng1 leads to mate in 1, after Rxg1++)} Rf2+ {Didn't have to think for long over this one...} 21. Kh3 {(Kg1 would allow me to clean up on his 2nd rank with discovered checks, and Kh1 leads to an even quicker mate)} e5 {Protecting my Knight but also adding another threat just in case he tried (Ng1, as this would then be met with  . . . Nf6+, Kh4 g5++)} 22. Qb3+ {He tries a check.} Kh8 {but after my King move White resigns as there is no defence to Rxh2++  0 -1  Thank for looking. }
