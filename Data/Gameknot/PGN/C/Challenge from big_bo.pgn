1. e4 {Usual Opening} Nf6 {Threatening.} 2. e5 {Challenging} e6 {not sure, maybe just wanted to get his queen out. Loses the knight as a result} 3. exf6 {takes...} Qxf6 {The Queen comes out} 4. f3 {Prevents a Scholars Mate, which might have been the aim.} g6 {allowing the bishop through either way, but makes an attack up the black diag very tempting...} 5. Nc3 {Knight blocks the queen taking the rook when I B3} Bh6 {Bishop developed.} 6. b3 {now I get the bishop to threaten} O-O {but he castles...} 7. Bb2 {nonetheless, I go for it...} b6 8. Na4 {If he hadn't castled, I would have been guaranteed a high-value piece. now I'm just threatening the queen... Note the knight moving and guarding in one...} Bb7 {However, he didn't see the bishop, and so...} 9. Bxf6 {I get his queen at no Loss!} Bc6 {Bishop threatening the knight, a very roundabout route} 10. Nh3 {Developing and giving the potential to castle...} Bg7 {Forcing me to exchange or lose the rook..} 11. Bxg7 {So I do...} Kxg7 12. Bd3 {Ready to castle...} f5 13. O-O {There we go.} Na6 {again, the 'Passive' Bishop gets a kill} 14. Bxa6 {no covering pieces means the bishop is free} Rae8 15. c4 e5 16. Bb5 a6 {Piece Exchange: I'm ahead and so am perfectly willing.} 17. Bxc6 dxc6 18. c5 {and again...} bxc5 19. Nxc5 e4 20. f4 {If I took, he would have taken me with the pawn, then if the knight takes then I lose out to the castle. therefore, I move to safety.} e3 {and he continues} 21. Ng5 e2 {Honestly Didn't expect that move. A Brilliant move, I think.} 22. Qe1 Re7 {no Idea... specially since he could have got the rook in exchange for a pawn.} 23. Nce6+ {The start of the rampage. Here, I get a Rook} Kf6 {in exchange for nothing?} 24. Nxf8 c5 25. Ngxh7+ {Check, and guarded by the other knight} Kf7 26. Ne6 {White Moves his knight, seemingly making a Mistake and leaving it unguarded} Rxe6 {Black Accepts the offering} 27. Ng5+ {and the other Knight gets the rook!} Kf6 {but the king guards just as well...} 28. Nxe6 Kxe6 {I made a chess puzzle from this point onwards.} 29. Qxe2+ {saving the rook} Kf6 30. Rae1 a5 {my guess is he thought I would go to E6, leaving him safe from checkmate...} 31. Qe7# {but I have a different plan!}
