1. d4 {Hello everybody! I liked that game a lot so i decided to annotate it! Please feel free to comment and rate! I started with d4.} d5 {He played d5, good move though i would played Nf6.} 2. c4 {c4 then.....} dxc4 {And he accepted the pawn....} 3. Nf3 {So far it's good for both.} b5 {b5 i think is quite risky and holds him back in development.....} 4. a4 {a4 is logical reply...} c6 {c6? i think is quite worthless move. e6 or Nf6 would be better i guess...} 5. e3 {i was wondering between e3 and e4 but i played e3.} Bg4 {He opened his bishop...} 6. Nc3 {I wanted to develop all my pieces...} a6 {a6 is bad i think....The king's side is still unorganized...} 7. axb5 {i decided to take the pawn...} cxb5 {He took it too...I'm a pawn down but i'm doing better in development...} 8. Be2 {i wanted to rooke so i opened the bishop..} Bxf3 9. Bxf3 {We exchanged the pieces...Now his rook is in danger!} Ra7 {So he moved it....His pieces and generally his defence is disorganized and he's back in development...} 10. O-O {i rooked } f6 {f6? Another bad move....He's blocking his knight and opens the white line too...} 11. d5 {I think d5 was the best move to do...} Rd7 {He's moving the rook...} 12. e4 {But i'm playing e4 to protect the pawn...} e5 {e5 was good i think but his king's side is still bad...} 13. Bg4 {i wanted to threat his rook and open my bishop generally....} Rc7 {he moved it on that square, but i believe is bad placed...} 14. Be3 {i opened the black bishop and had a plan to moved it in the c6 square...What do you think?} Bc5 {He saw that threat so he decided to exchange them...} 15. Bxc5 Rxc5 {And i accepted that...Now the plan is to attack somehow to his king...} 16. b4 {threat his rook everywhere!} Rc7 {So he put it back...} 17. Bf5 {Now the plan to move after that the queen in the h5 square...} g6 {But he played g6 so i have to move it back...} 18. Bg4 h5 {h5 is not helping very much i think....} 19. Be6 {This is a good place gor my bishop!} Ne7 {Now is not help to develop the knight....} 20. Qf3 {The will have to attack to his king's side...} Rf8 {In order to protect f6 pawn...} 21. Rad1 {I have to move forward the d-pawn so it needs protection!} Ra7 {He moved there because if he didn't it would then come d6!} 22. Qg3 {I will try to attack to the g6 pawn but i have to push his knight firstly!} Nd7 {That's bad i think...} 23. d6 {d6! A nice move....he have to move the knight or let the pawn take it!} Nc6 {So he moved it ignoring the checkmate that's coming...} 24. Qxg6+ {Check!} Rf7 {Nothing more to do....} 25. Qxf7# {And i won the game..... I like that game cause it was a little bit different from others....Please comment and rate! Hope you liked it!}
