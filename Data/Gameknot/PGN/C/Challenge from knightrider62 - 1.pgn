[Opening "KP (C20), Napoleon's opening"]

1. e4 {The conventional opening.  And, Sue will abide, as I anticipate.} e5 2. Qf3 {The problem here is that Duncan decides to bring his Queen out now.  The first thing that should be done is develop the minor pieces, with the Queen coming out, last.} Nf6 {So, Sue waists no time and brings her pieces out.  This makes me proud because she's remembering what I taught her, up to here.  BTW, it's important to know that she was able to defeat me.  And, I see her becoming good enough to coach and mentor players because I started off in a similar way.  Not sure what to do or how to improve but then had some good teachers, with me defeating the main one (Jack Stockel) on a few occasions.  Shortly afterwards, I was able to teach chess.  } 3. d3 {Adding protection to his e4.} Nc6 {Lacking in it, Sue continues with her development.} 4. Nc3 {So, does Dun.} Bc5 {Now, this reminds of a Berlin wall, but in reverse.  It's not or even similar, but I find it comparable and would apply it, as if it were with this move, as well.  The Berlin Wall starts off with 1.e4, e5 2.Nf3, Nc6 3.Bb5, Nf6  We don't have that because white's Queen, as opposed to, Knight is on f3.  And, Black's Bishop is out. } 5. Be3 {Preparing to exchange bishops.  The idea being that if Sue should take, Dun would recapture with his Queen and get a stronger position.  } d6 {But, Sues stops it.} 6. g3 {Fianchettoing.  The idea is to get a nice long flank for his Bf1.} O-O {Bringing her monarch to safety.} 7. Bh3 {Completing his development.  However, it's known, that in this position, 7.Bg2 was stronger.  The problem is that Sue can exchange bishops.  If that's to happen, castling would become unsafe for Duncan.  With that being said, This is where I transition out of terms or chess quotes and try to see the big picture.  In the opening, it's standard, but now's the time to start figuring what the board is saying.  With that being said, we start here with what I noted as I'm basing on my recent game behind against bhidragon, before I went wrong.  He said that with a bishop remaining on the home square, you should not attempt to exchange bishops for the reason provided.} Nb4 {Threatening a nasty fork, which would win a pawn and rook.  Sue has good intentions.  But, I would exchanged with 7...Bxh3, for the reason outlined above.  Nonetheless, however, Duncan is not going to castle short, though.  And, it's worth noting that this also would've protected the Rook.  But, he protects, in a different form.} 8. Rc1 Nxa2 {?? The first blunder.  I know why you played this, Sue.  It appears that you've won a pawn.  When I first started playing, I made this kind of error, as well.  So, I know what you're thinking.  The problem is that Duncan can and will win a piece, in return.  Therefore, it's important to calculate accurately and see what would happen after you take.  Better was still 8...Bxh3.} 9. Nxa2 Be6 {Threatening to win back the Knight.} 10. Nc3 {Which Duncan defends.} Bb4 {?! Pinning the Knight.  However, Duncan will get a semi open file, in return, which is something you don't want.  That, right there, is dangerous.  In fact, while it doesn't appear so, that's something that the board shows, later on, as I saw with some TA's blitz Q sacs.  Better was 10...a6, Sue. } 11. Ra1 Qd7 {? The is to mobilize her Queen, but in doing so, white is going to win a pawn, Sue.  Better was still 11...a6.  BTW, this is one of the problems affiliated with enabling the opponent to maintain an open file.  So, this is also where the board tells a story.} 12. Bxa7 c6 {Her plan is c6-d5, and if an exchange is to occur, black's pawn will be well connected.} 13. g4 {Stopping the Bishop exchange.} Rfe8 {Bringing the Rook to the center, which is, generally, a good idea.} 14. Qg3 {Enabling him to get a good outpost for his Ng1, because he can now bring it to f3.} d5 {Going for a pawn exchange.} 15. g5 {Which Dun stops by going after her Nf6.} Nh5 {So, sue keeps her position safe, for now by reattacking.} 16. Qf3 {Likewise, Dun needed to defend his position.  So, he reattacks.} d4 {Sue has similar ideas, though.} 17. Qxh5 {So, Dun takes.} Qd6 {?? Instead of recapturing, black moved her Queen.  I don't know why, but the problem is that this loses another piece, Sue.  Best was 17...dxc3, and white dare not recapture with 18.bxc3, because you'd win a Rook for Bishop, after 18...Bxc3+!} 18. Bg4 {After white's next move, I'm not sure why Dun played this.  I would've taken with 18.Bxe6, as the idea is exchanging pieces while ahead.} b5 {I believe that Sue's long term goal is to get a passed pawn.  The idea would be to exchange  Knight for Bishop and advance the b pawn, until it get to the second rank, where it would become a passer.  Better, was, like before, 18...dxc3 for the reasons outlined earlier.} 19. Bf5 {?? But, Dun brings his Bishop.  Instead, I would've exchanged with 19.Bxf5  However, it is a blunder because black can win back a piece.  Can you figure out how, Sue?} Bc5 {? Best was 19...Bxf5 and if 20.exf5, you can answer with 20...dxc3, as now, the Queen and Bf5 are forked.  This would, at the very least, win back a piece for a pawn.  When in doubt, just remember our third mentoring session, Sue, where you won a piece for pawn, early.  By playing this, however, Dun will pick up another pawn.  But, now when it does happen, black will not get a Rook, in return, as we'll see later on. } 20. Bxh7+ Kf8 21. g6 {Trying to exchange pawns.  After which, black's rook would come under fire, and when she protects, things would, I believe, get dangerous for Sue. } Qe7 {But, black prevents that.  However, I would take on c3.  In fact, there are several moves, including now, where white can prevent that.  His best move would be Ne2.} 22. Nf3 {Bringing the Knight to a good spot and preparing to do some damage.  However, Sue will now take.    } dxc3 23. bxc3 {As bad as it might seem, on top of winning back a piece for pawn, Sue will recompensate another piece for pawn.  My first instinct was that white could've refuted that with 23.Bxc3, but then, Sue would wind up with the initiative, after 23...Rxa1+  } Bxa7 24. Nxe5 Qd6 {? Trying to win another piece and even things out.  But, this is a mistake, as Dun will win back another pawn.  Better was 24...Qf6, as it does the same thing, but this time, we have another defender, to where Dun is going to capture.} 25. Nxf7 Bxf7 26. gxf7 Red8 {Protecting her Rook.} 27. Rg1 {Dun, however, comes up with a nasty plan.  Black must now be careful.  If Sue does not find the right response, she'll wind up in trouble.  So, how should black proceed, Sue.} Qc5 {?? This is a blunder.  Best was 27...g6, and with the Queen in it's original spot, white would not be able to take.  However, this is even worse then that, as white now has a better response.  How should Dun proceed, Sue?} 28. Rxg7 {?? If you did not bring your Queen to c5, Sue, this would've been the killer.  The problem here is that you have a chance to pull a swindle.  Therefore, best was 28.Qg6!!, believe it or not.  That would be followed with 28...Qxc3+, 29.Ke2, Qxa1 and, although it looks like you'd get an edge, black would be lost shortly after that.  30.Qxg7+, Ke7 31.f8=Q+, Ke6 32.Qfe7#  But, how can black get her advantage back?} Qxf2+ {?? This looks good, but the solution was 28...Qxh5, getting the Queen.  Not only would you have compensated, but black would've found herself ahead with an edge.  By playing this, however, white now has a win that he can exploit.  Therefore, taking the Queen was the only way to save the position, believe it or not, as we'll find out later on.} 29. Kd1 {I do understand the point behind the checks, as you do get a Rook, though.  But, the problem is the Queen, Rook, Bishop, and passed pawn right near the King.  That's what will prove to be overwhelming.} Qf1+ 30. Kd2 Qxa1 31. Rg8+ {As now, white has the upper hand of hand.  As bhidragon would say, "Happy Birthday! A surprise gift."  The idea being is that he now has an overwhelming advantage.} Ke7 32. Qg5+ Kd6 {The only other option was 32...Kd7  While not as quick, Sue would still lose both her Rooks, after 33.Bf5+, Kc7 34.Qe7+  } 33. Rxd8+ Kc7 34. Rxa8 {It appears that Sue is trying to put pressure on the c file.  I used to think along a similar line a lost position, like this.  In fact, it once happened to Jack Stockel, when I had a mating sequence.  How minds think, in my opinion, become interesting, in these kinds of situations.} Qa3 35. e5 {The idea is to promote.  Dun is, presumably, remembering that passed pawns must be pushed.  But, this is one of the times, where I don't care about those terms.  Instead, white can win even quicker with 35.f8=Q, with the idea being 35...Qxf8, 36.Rxf8  I had a similar position with angellis, before reaching a 1000 rating.  She was stronger, but I promoted right away, and got a piece, by doing this.} Kb6 {Trying to last, as long as, she can.  The idea is to bring the monarch closer to the center.  Once again, I abandon the term affiliated with it since, despite the delays, since black will not last much longer, to put it that way.} 36. e6 {The idea is to promote two pawns.  In general, however, as with this position, you don't need two promotions to win.  Better is actually to promote one, or not promote.  I'd say in this case, do one, but then, use what you have to win.  } b4 {Now, I figured it out.  Black is also trying to promote.  But, with a pawn closer to a promotion square and an advantage like this, Sue, that attempt does not work.  I once tried the same thing in a, somewhat similar position.  He promoted first, and won.} 37. e7 {No matter how long he delayed, white is going to promote soon.} Qxc3+ {But, Sue delays it even more by placing Dun in check.  In this case, you might as well deliver checks because it's still about doing what one can to stay in longer.  I also used to be this way when first playing the game.  Come to think of it now, before meeting Jack Stockel (and thus) even hearing about this website, one of my first trainers was Rose.  And, we did similar things.  I was lost, yet, delivered checks, like this.  That delayed her win.} 38. Kd1 Qa1+ {And, the idea is still the same that I mentioned earlier.} 39. Ke2 Qb2 {Pinning c2 to prevent it's advancement.  But...} 40. e8=Q {Dun promotes, at once.} Qxc2+ {Well, they have an extra Queen, with nothing better, you might as well take a pawn.  That's something that Jack told me when mating him.  And, it's also something I saw in the most difficult Homework, with Susan's win against Karpov.} 41. Qd2 {I think Dun was worried about a draw by repetition, which is why offered to exchange Queens.  I wouldn't have done that.  My next move would've been 41.Kf3, and white would still keep his winning advantage.} Qc5 {?? But, Sue decides not to liquidate.  The idea being that you don't want to do it, while behind.  However, refusing to do that, in this position, enables white to win even quicker.  Better was to accept it and exchange Q's.} 42. Be4 {To protect d3.  But, what Dun forgot is that it is protected by his Queen.  I would've played 42.Qd7 here, with the idea of 43.Qxa7+, Kb5 (forced) 44.Qa6#} b3 {Sue also wants to promote.} 43. d4 {But, Dun puts a stop to that.} Qb5+ {Like before, Sue's doing what she can to stay in longer.} 44. Kf3 Qa4 {I think that Sue was worried about the b pawn.  But, Dun is going to promote again.  I think, I would've been able to mate already since Qd7 would've been played earlier with the same variations that I noted.} 45. f8=Q Kb5 {Unlike before, I won't take time to analyze this move.  That's because, one way or another Dun has a mate which he will execute, this time around.} 46. Qxc6# {The moral of this story is what Sue told mentioned right when asking me to annotate the game.  And, I, absolutely, agree with her assessment.  Passed pawns are very dangerous and need to be stopped.  By failing to do that, white was able to promote and force a win.  However, there was also a chance to stop it by taking the Q on move 28.  Had she played 28...Qxh5!, as opposed to, 28...Qxf2. those passers would've stopped, as well.  So, another moral is to look at the entire board, and take advantage while the opportunity exists.  If you can remember these moral's, Sue, you'll improve even quicker.}
