1. e4 {King's pawn, Sicilian time} c5 2. Bc4 {This guy always plays Bc4 on me.  I don't really know if my continuation with Sicilian is appropriate, so any feedback here would be appreciated.  Every book and video I read/watch never covers when Bc4 is played here during Sicilian.  Also, I can bet that the d pawn won't move up to d4 to challenge my c pawn.  We'll see.} Nc6 {I guess they call this accelerated dragon... but I have no intention in the Dragon this game.  I simply like having a minor piece out early.} 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nc3 Nf6 {so far so good} 5. h3 {Is this a good move for white?  It prevents my knight and bishop from moving to g4, but does it in any way compromise King's defense?  This opponent typically does this on both sides of the board.  a3 will be a move at some point... or has been in previous games.} a6 {I do this from the Najdorf variation.. and love the blockage to his bishop.} 6. a3 {It does prevent my knight from charging, but would love to hear from stronger players on this play.} b5 {I want to fianchetto my bishop, and challenge his bishop} 7. Ba2 {a3 was a great move for this scenario.  but was h3 good as well?} Bb7 8. d3 {his black squared bishop is now active.} e6 {I want to get my black-squared bishop out so I can castle} 9. O-O Nd4 {I think I see something here that I'd like to try.  I want to remove that knight from f3 which is in a strong position to defend.    If 10.Nxd4 then cxd4 and that knight is gone and I gain a tempo attacking his other knight.  If he does something else, I will move Nxf3.  Eventually, I want to push ..d4, exd5..exd5.. and eventually bring my dark-squared bishop to d6.  I like the attacking lines of both bishops there.} 10. Be3 {Firstly, I think I would love to exchange his bishop for my knight as I intend to create an open game.  I can't count on him taking that knight right away, even though he just played the bishop there.  I want that knight off of f3.} Nxf3+ {11.Qxf3..d5.  i'm looking to move my bishop into position, but I am aware of the potential threat at f7.  If 12.exd5.. I may instead move Nxd5 keeping my e pawn in that protective role.  thoughts?} 11. Qxf3 d5 12. exd5 Nxd5 13. Nxd5 Bxd5 {i'm good with this.  he's forced to move Bxd5 - exchanging his best bishop for my least valuable bishop.  he invested good time putting that bishop on a good square.  or because i have a pawn on e6, does that make a2 a bad square for the white bishop?} 14. Bxd5 exd5 15. Rae1 {so suddenly i see i'm in trouble.  he can take my c5 pawn, and I can't do anything about it because of the hidden check with R on e1.  i could move d4, and then he can move Bg5!  I can block with Be7, but i'm going to lose my Queen.  i'm thinking move Be7 now, and hopefully contain my loses... which will be huge.   where did I go wrong in the opening to find myself here?} Be7 16. Bxc5 {yep} O-O {i'm getting desperate here.  i'm thinking that my R on h8 wasn't doing anything anyway, so I can afford to lose it.} 17. Bxe7 Qc7 18. Bxf8 Rxf8 19. Qe3 h6 20. Re2 g5 {no idea what i'm doing here... hoping to create an opening for his king's defense before his three major pieces crush my king.} 21. Qd4 Qd6 {i'm protecting d5, and getting ready to move f6 followed by Kg7} 22. h4 f6 23. Rfe1 {i don't really see what i can do here} Qd7 24. Re2e7 Qd8 25. Qa7 a5 26. Rg7+ Kh8 27. Rh7+ Kg8 28. Qg7# {}
