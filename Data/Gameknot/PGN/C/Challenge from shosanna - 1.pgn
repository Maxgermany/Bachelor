1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {King's knight. } c5 {Pe5 is undefended.  White often comes back with c3 instead. } 3. Nxe5 Nc6 {NxN doubles black's pawns. } 4. f4 d6 5. Nxc6 Qd7 {I think taking the knight would be better. } 6. Na5 b6 7. Nc4 Ba6 8. e5 dxe5 9. fxe5 {Taking it with the knight instead gives white the a6 bishop, potentially.} O-O-O 10. Nd6+ {NxPb6 looks better.  Bishop and pawn for the knight. } Bxd6 11. exd6 {BxBa6+ first, then PxBd6.} Re8+ 12. Be2 Qg4 13. O-O {Oops, now BxBe2 for free.} Bxe2 14. Qe1 Nf6 {Excellent.  The rook is now protected.} 15. d3 {Rf2 might be better.} Bxf1 16. Qxf1 Qd4+ 17. Qf2 {Better to move the king.  Re1# ends the game.} Ng4 18. c3 {Re1# is the way to go.} Qxf2+ 19. Kh1 Re1# {That, or Qf1#.  }
