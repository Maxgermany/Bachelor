[Opening "French (C02), advance variation"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {C03: French: Advance variation} c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Bb5 {5.Bb5?! First move out of book.  I was not prepared for this move.  Does White want to trade the versatile knight in this closed position for his strong light bishop which normally goes on the d3 square?  Only about a dozen players over 2100 have played this move.  Definitely some advantage for black now.  Two best responses are block pin with Bd7 or continue with thematic Qb6 earlier than normal.  I chose Qb6 thinking it would force the trade or bring more play to the queenside where I have a space advantage.  I thought the line would progress 5...Qb6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 with my side pawn toward the center which would soon continue to pressure d4. } Qb6 6. a4 {White holds position.  I did not think about this move because normally a well timed a3 and b4 pawn advance is very strong for white which is now lost. I decide to open play a bit here, take the d4 pawn and being in my kingside knight into play with ...Nge7 and then ...Nf5 to put pressure on the backward pawn that white would now have to defend.} cxd4 7. cxd4 Nge7 8. Nc3 {This defends the bishop and frees the pawn to force the queen away.  It also continues to keep the play on the queenside where I want it.  I think Ne2 would be better here. } a6 {Time force the the bishop to act.} 9. a5 Qc7 10. Bxc6+ {An unforseen advantage to 7...Nge7 now allows me to take with the Knight and win the a5 pawn.  I figured the bishop would just retreat here to a4 or d3.} Nxc6 11. Nf3 Nxa5 12. Bd2 {Is this a bait to swap another bishop for a knight?  If so I'll definitely take it.  I want to bring my knight back to the center and giving me a target only makes the decision easier. } Nc4 13. b3 {I am unsure what black was planning with this move. I'm going to take the bishop unless it is moved.  The pawn could be easily be defended with Qc2 Qb3. Also, with some of the pressure released planning a castle and kingside attack would force me to either counter attack or bring my pieces back to defend.} Nxd2 14. Nxd2 {Huge blunder here for white leaving the Knight hanging.   Rybka analysis if play had continued with 14.Qxd2.  -1.40/23   14.Qxd2 Bb4 15.Rc1 Bd7 16.0-0 Qa5 17.Qe3 0-0 18.Ra1 Qb6 19.Na2 Be7 20.Nc3 Rac8 21.Rfc1 Qb4 22.Ne2 h6 23.Nf4 Rxc1+ 24.Rxc1 Rc8 25.Rxc8+ Bxc8 26.Qc1 Bd7 27.Qc2 Qb5 28.h3} Qxc3 {White resigns.  }
