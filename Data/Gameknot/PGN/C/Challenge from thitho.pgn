[Opening "English opening (A10)"]

1. c4 {While I and Jack don't play this, it's a well known variation, the English Opening.} b6 {I don't know why black played this, but it is out of book.  It's actually similar to the Sodium attack, which would happen, had white played 1.e4  Instead, the most common response here is 1...e4, so now you have a reversed Sicilian, as the Sicilian is 1.e4, c4} 2. d4 Bb7 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Qc2 {?! While the analysis doesn't mention anything, in my mind this is an inaccuracy.  Of course, not every single guideline should be followed, as there's so many that sometimes conflict with one another.  The only idea behind it is to get your pieces out, castle, and establish mobility.  And, there are also exceptions where it must be broken to win material, of it leads to mate or losing material.  This isn't one, and in my mind, this is the most important guideline of them all.  I don't know why black got his Q out this early, as nothing's being threatened.  But, it does not develop nor help him with development.  Now, chicoboy can use that time to get his pieces into a play, while white wasted time with this move.  With it, black should have a small advantage, at this point. } d5 {?! I understand the idea behind this move.  It's the exchange variation, and normally it would be a very strong move because it develops a center pawn which is needed to open lines for the B and control the center.  However, this is a time where guidelines must be broken.  That's because, according to the analysis, it is an inaccuracy.  Best, in this position, was 5...Nf6  Then, this could happen.  6.e3, 0-0 7.Bd3, c5 8.a3, Bxc3+ 9.Qxc3, Bxf3 10.gxf3, cxd4 11.exd4, Nc6 12.Rg1, g6 and black has a slightly stronger structure.} 6. e3 {This would be the best response, had black played 5...Nf6, as noted earlier.  But, according to what I saw, the best response to 5...d5 is 6.cxd5 6...exd5 7.e3, Nc6 8.a3, Be7 9.Bb5, a6 10.Bxc6+, Bxc6 11.0-0, Nf6 12.Ne5, Bd7 13.Bd2  So, white gets to exchange black's N for a B.  Now, I learned that B's are generally worth more then N's.  However, I also learned from Jack, that usually, N's are worth more B's.  Now, Jack showed me a game between GM's Petrosian, who was the world champion at the time, and Spassky.  It was both even, but Petrosian lost.  He went wrong by giving up by exchanging his N for Spassky's B.  That's because, as it turned out, Petrosians N was worth more and dangerous.  In fact, that would've been the killer and had he not exchanged, Petrosian would've won.  And, on a much smaller, believe it or not, this position, is somewhat similar.  So, I understand what's going on and had this happened, where titho got a N for his B, he would've had the advantage.  And, that is why 5...d5?! was an inaccuracy.  Note: That against much stronger players, just one inaccuracy can make a big difference.  And, what I recently learned is that it generally only takes one mistake to make or break a game.  For example, Tom recently played against a Master.  He was outplaying him the entire time with a winning advantage as Tom was a piece up.  However, he only made one blunder, and that was enough to turn everything around.  It allowed the Master to pull a swindle and win the game.  Had this mistake not been made, it would've been an easy win for Tom.} Nd7 7. Bd2 Bxc3 8. Bxc3 h6 9. Bd3 g6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. O-O-O {!? In my opinion, this is a risky move, especially in this position.  And, I don't think that white had a good reason for castling long, as opposed to, K side.  In general with pawns surrounding the K it's better to castle K side because it is said that castling Q side puts you at risk of K exposure.  I feel that it is especially the case here.  It's now a similar position to a past game against Jack, and I had the option of castling K side or Q side.  Well, I decided to, like here, castle long, and that is what sealed my fate.  Note: In that game, the Sicilian, like usual, was played, and by playing ...0-0-0, I wound up exposing my K. } Qe7 12. g3 Ngf6 13. Nh4 Ne4 14. a3 {According to the analysis, this is an inaccuracy.  Instead, best was, 14.a3 with the idea of 14...0-0-0 15.Bxe4, dxe4 16.Qb3, Qg5 17.Qc4, Rfc8 18.Qe2, Re8 19.Qc4, c6 20.Bb4, Qd5  This time, I disagree with it.  First, it's not the beginning game, and everyone has completed development.  Second, in my opinion, this was thitho's best move.  It's a somewhat similar position to my game against Jack, yesterday.  But, what happened was that I was in trouble and my coach was threatening mate.  Therefore, I had to give my K air to breath on the b file.  Then, there was more trouble, so I played a3  Jack said, "This is a very strong move."  What he was implying was that it was the best move.  That's because not only did I get out of trouble, but I also established a very strong pawn structure, like this.  Right now, I believe that white is playing extremely well, so far. } Qe6 15. Kb1 Nxc3+ 16. Qxc3 O-O-O {In this position, however, I feel that Gerhard made the right choice by castling Q side.  The structure, is what you'd typically see if one castled K side.  The idea being is that black structure, meaning his material is surrounding and protecting his K, whereas, on the K side, there is already a weakness, as the pawns providing a lot of coverage for the K.  With that, I feel that black is now much safer, and despite material even, black already has an advantage.} 17. Bb5 {?? Another inaccuracy, according to the analysis.  But, in my opinion, this is actually a blunder, as I'll explain on the next move.  The best move, from what I saw was 17.Ng2  Then, comes something like 17...c6 18.Nf4, Qd6 19.Rc1, Nf6 20.f3, Rd7 21.h4, Re8 22.Rhe1, Rc7 23.Qd2, Rce7 24.b4} c6 {According to the analysis best was 17...g5  Then, it would be followed up with e.g., 18.Rc1, c5 19.dxc5, Nxc5 20.Rhg1, gxh4 21.b4, hxg3 22.Rxg3, a6 23.bxc5, axb5 24.cxb6+, Kb8 25.Qc5, Qf5+ 26.Rc2  So, black would've won a piece for a pawn which is why 17.Bb5?? was a blunder.} 18. Rdc1 c5 {? I'm not going to keep going over variations because there are three of these in a row.  What's important, however, is the concepts that go into them as that's how you tie theory into all of this.  Accordingly this is a mistake because it should lose a pawn after 19.dxc5, Nxc5 20.f3, Kb8 21.b4, d4 22.Qb2, Nb3 23.Bc4, Be4+ 24.fxe4, Qxe4+ 25.Qc2, Nd2+ 26.Kb2, Qxc2+ 27.Rxc2, Nxc4+ 28.Rxc4, dxe3  After looking at it, I agree.  Best then, would be 18...Kb8 as then 19.Bd3, c5 20.Ng2, c4 21.Bc2, Qg4 22.Rcf1, Nf6 23.f3, Qg5 24.Nf4, Rhe8 25.Rc1, a5 and, ..."Everything holds", as Jack would say.  Meaning: That everything would still be safe.   } 19. Bxd7+ {Best was 19.dxc5+ for the reason outlined above.} Kxd7 {!? The analysis gives this as an inaccuracy as it loses a pawn because of what's about to unfold.  Instead, best was 19...Rxd7, 20.Rhe1, c4 21.e4, Kb8 22.exd5, Qxd5 23.Qxc4, Qxd4 24.Qxd4, Rxd4 25.f3, Rc8 26.Rxc8+, Kxc8 27.Re7  However, as I will explain shortly, I don't completely agree with the analysis, as it doesn't have to be a free pawn.  There's a way out of it.  However, I do feel that this capture is risky because it leaves black K a little susceptible to exposure when it blocks the d R, and now if white is ever able to find a move that would place chicoboy in check, he'll have a harder time getting the K to safety.} 20. dxc5 Rdc8 {? I don't know why he moved here, but this is the move that loses a pawn.  Instead, best was to recapture, at once, with 20...bxc5  } 21. Qd4 g5 {Understandable, wanting to drive that N away and gaining tempo.  But, why do that, when you can win something back.  As it turns out, 21...bxc5! would have done that.} 22. Ng2 Rhe8 {The idea, I believe was to attack the center which is generally a good strategy.  Why?  Well, as I learned from wrecking_ball in, "The Deeper Chess Theory Club", from the snap shot analysis thread, attacking the center is another way to control.  And, since Gerhard, put one of the R's on the e file, it's right in the center, doing a little damage on the e file.  However, best, as the analysis puts it is 22...bxc5  Do note, that he also could have played this earlier.  With this move the opportunity is gone due to white's next move.} 23. Rhd1 Qe5 {! Best, as this move protects black d pawn, once and for all.} 24. Qxe5 Rxe5 25. cxb6 axb6 26. Ne1 Rxc1+ 27. Kxc1 Re4 28. Nf3 Ke6 29. Nd4+ Kd6 30. f3 Re8 31. Rd3 Rc8+ 32. Kd2 Ba6 33. Rc3 Rxc3 34. Kxc3 Kc5 35. Nf5 h5 36. Ng7 {According to the Analysis, this is an inaccuracy.  Well, I agree, but at the same time, disagree.  I don't think that there was anything wrong with the move played.  However, best is still 36.b4!  Now, it looks bad because you'd think that with this move black white will lose another pawn.  But, that isn't as it would be a good gambit (useful sac that would be useful to promote a pawn and guarantee a win for black.)  Here's how.  After white checks with the b pawn 36...Kc6 37.Kd4, Kb5 38.Nd6+, Ka4 39.Nxf7, Kxa3 40.Nxg5, Kxb4 41.Kxd5, Bb7+ 42.Kd4, Ka3 43.e4, b5 44.e5, b4 45.e6, b3  And, no matter how drawish it looks for the powerful pawns, black has an easy way to promote it, and he can do something to prevent white from promoting due to his LSB.  It's very similar to the position on my actual game against Jack, not the annotated version.  By that, I allude to my epic and historic game against my coach where I learned just how important thinking ahead is in chess and life and why I'm still a very serious chess player.  Because this is also how I learned the extent that chess really stretches and imagination.  In the actual game, I had two pawns+ my K.  But, he had his LSB, a P, and his K.  Despite it looking like a won game for me, it was just the opposite because Jack was much closer to promoting a pawn.  It was only about two ranks from the promotion square, whereas, I had three or four ranks to go.  Plus, the promotion would have occurred on the light square, so were I to promote, he'd be able to stop it cold with his LSB.  This end would be, to an extent, a similar position.} h4 37. gxh4 gxh4 38. b4+ Kc6 39. Kd4 Be2 40. f4 Bg4 41. Ne8 Bd7 {For some reason, the analysis gives this as an inaccuracy because of what white is about to play.  According to what I saw, best was 41...Bd1  I don't agree with it, as I don't like the B crammed on my square.  In fact, what thitho does is not going to be a problem for black.  And, I also would've played this, if I were black.} 42. Nf6 Be6 43. e4 {? The analysis gives this move as a mistake.  In my mind, it isn't but rather a small inaccuracy.  Best, accordingly was 43.Ke5  The only reason I agree with this is that white should win another pawn with a little liquidation on top of that without anything for black to follow up on, supposedly.  After titho would play Ke5 we have something like 43...Bh3 44.Nxd5!, Bg2 45.Nc3, Bf1 46.a4, Bc4 47.e4, h3 48.Nd5, Bb3 49.a5, bxa5 50.bxa5, Kb5 51.Kf6, Kc5 52.Nc3} dxe4 44. Nxe4 b5 {For whatever reason, the analysis gives marks this as an inaccuracy because of 45.Ke5, Kd7 46.f5, Bc4 47.Kd4, Bf1 48.Kc5, Ke7 49.Nd6, Kf6 50.Nxb5, Kxf5 51.Nd6+, Ke6 52.a4, f5 53.b5, f4 54.a5, f3  I disagree with it because this line gives black a winning advantage as now that f pawn promotes.  I don't know the theory behind it, so I'll just get to it based on what the computer suggests.  So, apparently, the best move was 44...Bb3 and then would come, perhaps, 45.Ke5, Kb5 46.Kd6, Bc2 47.Nc3+, Ka6 48.Kc6, b5 49.Nd5, Be4 50.Kc5, Bxd5 51.Kxd5, Kb6 52.f5, h3 53.Kd6, f6  Whether or not is completely remains to be seen.  But, in my mind, this is a very strong move, preventing white from advancing b pawn any further.} 45. Ke5 Bd5 46. Nf6 Bf3 47. Ne8 Kd7 {Accordingly, this is an inaccuracy, but I don't agree with that. The idea being: 48.Ng7, Kc7 49.Nf5, h3 50.Nd4, Bc6 51.Nxc6, Kxc6 52.f5, Kd7 53.Kd5, Ke7 54.Kc6, Kf6 55.Kxb5, Kxf5 56.Kc5, Ke5 57.b5, f5  That leaves with the best move being 47...Be2, as then 48.Nf6, Bd3 49.Ne4, Bxe4 50.Kxe4, Kd6 51.Kf5, Kd5 52.Kf6, Ke4 53.Kxf7, Kxf4 54.Ke6, Ke4 55.Kd6, Kd4 56.Kc6, Kc4 57.h3, Kc3  And, I absolutely agree with that because as the analysis, in the long run, 47...Kd7 is what will help black to achieve the opposition, when we reach the endgame.  As I've learned from Jack, in the endgame, you generally want to strive for the opposition, as it will give you a stronger position.} 48. Nd6 {I disagree with analysis, but apparently as I don't see anything wrong with the move played.  In fact, I view as one of white's best moves.  But, apparently, it's an error because after the exchange the threat would eventually become 50.Kg7, Ke6 51.Kg6, Be4+ 52.Kg5, h3 53.Kg4, Bg2 54.Kg5, Bf1 55.f5+, Kf7 56.Kf4, Kf6 57.Kg4, Ke5 58.Kg5} f6+ 49. Kxf6 Kxd6 50. Kg5 h3 51. f5 Be4 52. Kf6 Kd5 53. Kg5 Kc4 {?? The computer only gives it as a mistake.  But, in my mind, this is a blunder which should cost black the game.  The reason being is 54.Kg4, Kd4 55.f6, Bd5 56.Kxh3, Ke5 57.Kg4, Kxf6 58.Kf4, Bb3 59.Kg4, Bd1+ 60.Kf4, Bc2 61.Kg4, Kg6 62.Kf4, Kh5 63.Ke5, Kg4  Despite being a pawn up, in that position, white would have two passed pawns, with one proving to be unstoppable.  And, this is why Jack taught me, as noted in previous annotations, to be aware of passed pawns.  There actually more dangerous then they might appear, especially if you have more then one, making one unstoppable, where it will promote, as would be the case there.  That leaves the best move being 53...Ke5 as black Gerhard would win another pawn.  54.f6, Ke6 55.Kg4, Bg2 56.Kg5, Kf7 57.Kf5, Bd5 58.Ke5, Be6 59.Kd6, Kxf6 60.Kc5, Bd7 61.Kb6, Ke6 62.Kc5, Kf5 63.Kd5, Be6+} 54. f6 {?? This, as the computer shows is a blunder.  Best was either 54.Kg4 as it wins material.  But, with this move black should win this game.  The idea being is that once black stops this dangerous pawn with 54...Bd5, no matter what white does, Gerhard, in the long run will have a pawn that'll prove to be unstoppable and will, henceforth, be able to promote.} Bd5 55. Kg6 {?? As is explained in the analysis, this is the losing blunder.  With this move, no matter how you slice, chicoboy will be able to compensate for the lost pawn.  Not only, will he do this by winning back material, but now one of his pawns will prove unstoppable, as he now has the opportunity to Q, forcing white into resignation.  Therefore, best, in this position was 55.Kh4, as then 55...Be6 56.f7, Bxf7 57.Kxh3, Kb3 58.Kg4, Kxa3 59.Kg5, Kxb4 60.Kf6, Be8 61.Ke7, Bh5 62.Kf6, Kc5 63.h4, b4 64.Kg5, b3 65.Kxh5  And, now, "everything holds", as Jack would say.} Kb3 56. f7 Bxf7+ 57. Kxf7 Kxa3 58. Ke6 Kxb4 59. Kd5 Kc3 60. Kc5 b4 {At this point, white waved, and what he said was, ''as I now cannot stop you from from promoting I resign'' The morals of this game are to develop your pieces before you bring out the Q, unless there is an extenuating circumstance, which wasn't the case here.  And, if your opponent has a passed pawn, do something about it right away, before it becomes a killer.  As noted in previous annotations, Jack Stockel has advised me to be weary of passed pawns because they're dangerous, and this is a perfect example of why.  Afterall, I made a very similar mistake in that game, by allowing him to have a passed pawns, which in that game, couldn't be stopped.  As a result, I was forced to resign for exactly the same reason that thitho resigned here.  The thing is that passed pawns are what often promote, which is why they're things to be weary of.  So if you don't figure out how to stop a passed pawn, it will be able to promote.  And, that will create problems and often cost you the game, as was the case here.}
