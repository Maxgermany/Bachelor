1. e4 {This was an unrated training game. Non the less it was very hard fought. In the opening early middlegame white has a small plus than by the late middlegame black had turned it around and had the advantage. In the transition from middlegame into the endgame white regained the advantage and went on to convert for the full point.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {jeich is an enterprising and aggressive player and the Dragon Defence suits his style.} 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 {The aggressive Rauzer Attack } O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 {"The -advantage of this old continuation over the more modern 9.Bc4 lies in the fact that the counter-play associated with Bc8-d7.......Rf8-c8 and Nc6-e5-c4 is now ineffective; the bishop can take the knight from f1 not from b3 saving white 2 tempi"-Gufeld and Stetsko. I chose 9.0-0-0 as it generally leads to more simplified positions than 9.Bc4} 9. O-O-O {"The advantage of this old continuation over the more modern 9.Bc4 lies in the fact that the counter-play associated with Bc8-d7...Rf8-c8...Nc6-e5-c4 is now ineffective:the bishop can take the knight not from b3, but from f1,saving white 2 clear tempi." -Gufield & Stetsko. I chose 9.0-0-0 as it generally leads to more simplified positions than 9.Bc4} d5 {This is the main line which can lead to a pawn sacrifice which theory considers sound.} 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Bd4 {12.Nxd5 accepting the pawn sac gives black too much counterplay for my liking.The move played blunts the power of the Dragon DSB and contests the dark squares.} Be6 { 12.....e5 12....Nxc3 12.....Bxd4 have been played far more often. jeich seeks new paths and puts both players on their own resources. } 13. Ne4 f5 {N!? Houdini2 gives this as +0.53 for white. 13....Bxd4 14.Qxd4 Qa5 is suggested as better with  -0.07 for black} 14. Nc5 Bf7 15. Bxg7 {Seeking simplification} Kxg7 16. Qd4+ Kg8 17. Bc4 Rb8 {Houdino2 prefers Qd6 but I prefer blacks move seeking counterplay down the b file} 18. Rhe1 {Centralising though Houdini2 prefers Qe5} Qd6 {targeting h2} 19. g3 Rfe8 20. f4 Rb6 21. Rd3 Reb8 22. Rb3 {Seeking simplification.Houdini2 prefers Rd2} Nf6 {22....Nxf6 23.Qxd6 exd 24.Nd7 Bxc4 25.Rxb6 Rxb6 26.Nxb6 Ne2ch and though we have a material imbalance the position offers equal chances to both sides and may have been blacks best option.} 23. Bxf7+ Kxf7 24. Qc4+ Qd5 25. Qxd5+ {ZI didn't see Houdini's suggested 25.Nd3 Qxc4 26.Ne5ch Kf8 27.Nxc4 with a small edge} cxd5 26. Rxb6 Rxb6 {I prefer 26...axb for black though both of equality} 27. c3 Rc6 28. b4 {28,Nd3 eyeing e5 was best with equality.I wanted more so came up with the idea of pushing the Q_side pawns.After 27.b4 Houdini gives a small plus for black} Ne4 29. Nxe4 fxe4 {The best recapture. White now realised he had slipped into a slightly inferior position.} 30. Kd2 Ra6 31. Ra1 Rb6 32. Ke3 e6 33. a4 {White's Q_side counterplay off sets blacks central advantage.The position is equal I think} Rc6 34. Ra3 Rc4 35. Rb3 Ke7 36. a5 a6 37. Ra3 Kd6 38. b5 axb5 {38.....Kc7 was better} 39. a6 {Now white has a small endgame advantage} Rc8 40. a7 Ra8 41. Kd4 Kc6 42. Ra6+ Kb7 43. Rxe6 Rxa7 44. Kxd5 Kc8 {44......Ra2 activating the rook was much better.45.Re7ch Kb6 46.Rxh7 e3 47.Re7 and though a pawn up blacks activity offers compensation} 45. Rxe4 Rc7 46. Kd4 Kd7 {46.....Rd7 47.Kc5 Rd2 activating the rook was probably better.} 47. Re5 Rb7 48. Kc5 Rc7+ 49. Kb4 Rc4+ 50. Kb3 Kc6 51. Re7 {And blacks K-side pawns fall .If 51...Kc5 52.Rc7ch Kd5 53.Rxc4 bxc 54.Kb4 with a won pawn ending.}
