1. d4 {Queen's Pawn opening,I play this from the White side often} Nf6 {If this were not a thematic tourney,I would never play this move. I always play 1...d5} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {all book moves in the KID (King's Indian Defense)} 5. f3 {Samisch variation. I have never played this from either side so I use the GK database to guide me a little.} O-O 6. Be3 e5 {getting the usual strike back in the center} 7. d5 {White prefers to close the center and gain space} Nh5 {a little bit odd looking at first,but the Knight is aiming for f4} 8. Qd2 {guarding f4 and creating the opportunity to castle Queenside to make it look interesting/} f5 {also another purpose of moving the Knight. In the KID, this is normal when someone prefers to close the center with d5.} 9. O-O-O {Opposite side castling. } a6 {the first step for supporting an eventual ...b5 to attack the King} 10. Bd3 Nd7 {the Knight heads for either f6 or b6,whichever Black wants.} 11. Nge2 {Surprisingly,this is still all book} b5 {?! GK computer gives this as an inaccuracy. Indeed,I lose a pawn with this move.} 12. cxb5 Nf4 {? Another mistake.   Computer gives 12...fxe4 13.fxe4 Nf4 with -0.97 (White has about a pawn advantage)} 13. Bxf4 exf4 14. Nxf4 fxe4 {? Another bad mistake. Black overlooks...} 15. Ne6 {! Fork! Black looks very lost.   Computer gives a -3.05 } Qe7 16. Bxe4 Rf6 {escaping the fork} 17. Nxc7 {White just simply captures the pawn.} Ra7 18. Ne6 {back to the very strong outpost on e6. Black looks as good as done in this position. All of his pieces are jumbled together. White has a beautiful knight and good looking pieces} Nb6 {The Knight prepares to jump to c4. What? I at least created a threat!} 19. Qd4 {?! A minor mistake,not game changing,but this allows me to take his best piece} Rxe6 {My best move since the opening. It doesn't win material but gets rid of one of the biggest problems,the knight on e6,which was constricting my activity} 20. Qxb6 Rf6 21. Rhe1 Qd7 {Sidestepping the discovered attack} 22. Qc6 {offering a trade of Queens,which would guarantee White the win.} Qd8 23. Bd3 Bd7 24. Qc4 axb5 {at least now I am opening lines to the King} 25. Nxb5 Bxb5 {Black recaptures immediately.  However,the Computer offers the interesting 25...Rb7!? It gives 26.Nc3 Rf8 27. Re2 Qa5 28.Kc2 Bxc3 29.bxc3 Ba4+ 30.Qxa4 Qxa4+ 31.Kd2 Qxa2+ 32. Bc2 with a -1.72 (in favor of White) But wait? I have a +4 material advantage and White isn't threatening to end matters soon,so how is he winning? And What's up with 30.Qxa4??  So I came up with 30.Kc1 Bxd1 31.Kxd1 Rfb8. White is up a pawn,but if White is not careful,Black has attacking chances.} 26. Qxb5 Rc7+ 27. Kb1 Rf8 {Black is aiming for all of his pieces to attack the enemy king} 28. Re6 Qc8 {threatening 29...Rb7} 29. Re2 {?! White can win another pawn with 29.Rxd6 since 29...Rb7 is answered with 30. Rb6} Rb7 30. Qa4 Qb8 31. Rdd2 Rc8 {All of the sudden,Black looks very active!} 32. Rdc2 Rxc2 {Not fearing} 33. Re8+ {Wait,I actually saw a move ahead? Phew,I'll try not to let that happen again...} Kf7 34. Rxb8 Rcxb2+ {an in-between move that wins a extra pawn} 35. Kc1 Rb7xb8 36. Qd7+ Kg8 37. Qxd6 {Arguably,I am still losing,but I have gotten a little closer in material and activity} Ra8 38. Qe6+ Kh8 39. d6 {now in this position,capturing on g2 would be best but I played...} Bh6+ {?? Oh no! I can't believed I played this! } 40. Kxb2 Rb8+ 41. Kc2 {I give up. Comments and criticism are welcome}
