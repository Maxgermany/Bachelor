[Opening "Bishop's opening (C23)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 b6 {An interesting reply to the Bishop's Opening. Elzie apparently intends to fianchetto the QB and pressure Colvin's KP.} 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. f4 {Almost a delayed King's Gambit. Clearly it catches Elzie off guard, because he plays an incredibly poor move in response.} f6 {Chess is 2/3 psychology. If you can spring a variant on your opponent that he's unprepared for, you can often induce a mistake... like this blunder, for instance.} 5. fxe5 {Colvin exchanges the Pawns before striking.} fxe5 {Lulled into a false sense of security, Elzie completes the exchange.} 6. Qh5+ {Ouch. Now it's a matter of how Elzie wants to lose.} Ke7 {The answer is quickly. 6...P-N3 7 QxKP ch folloed by 8 QxR would be how to lose slowly.} 7. Qf7+ Kd6 8. Nb5+ {The King-hunt is on in earnest.} Kc5 9. b4+ Kxb4 10. Rb1+ {Adding a 4th piece to the hunt.} Ka4 11. Bb3+ {Closing in.} Kxb5 12. Qc4+ {One move left.} Ka5 13. Qa4# {An effective, if not elegant, finish.}
