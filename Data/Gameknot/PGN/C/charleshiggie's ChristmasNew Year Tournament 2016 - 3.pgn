[Opening "Evans gambit (C52), compromised defence"]

1. e4 {Today in my quest of game annotation I continue my examination of games that I have played in the Evan's gambit. Unlike the first game that I played, this game was a closer affair with an interesting attack that lead to a winning endgame. Let's examine. } e5 {As normal with the Evan's gambit I will be making notes on what the computer (Komodo) says in these positions is the best move, focusing on what black should be doing on defense and what white should be doing on the attack. The usual caveat with machines not always understanding a position exists, however, machines tend to be quite good at concrete lines and tactics, which the Evan's gambit is full of. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {Signifying the Evan's gambit. Black does not actually have to take this pawn, but if they don't they do fall back into a passive position with white gaining space and often an attack as well. } Bxb4 {Also the best way to refute a gambit is to accept it. } 5. c3 {One of the main ideas in the opening is to stop black from developing properly all while opening avenues for your pieces to attack. At some point the idea is that black will have to give back some material to stay in the game and at worst white will have an even endgame. That is the idea of course. Does not always happen that way. } Ba5 {The best move, keeping an eye on the e1 square for the future. } 6. d4 {This is the variation I have been trying so far. It is a full 3 pawn sac if black wants. Check out another game I annotated if you would like to see how that might go. http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=62485} exd4 {The natural move, accepting another pawn and asking white what their idea is. } 7. O-O {The full three pawn sacrifice, at least temporarily. Black can take on c3 and be up three pawns and down in development. Or they can start to develop but give white a strong center with many nice attacking chances. } d6 {Black chooses the latter idea and plays the natural looking d6 move. There are often ideas here of white playing e5 because d6 is now a target to attack, but if white can't figure out a way to do that then it opens up the light squared bishop and tries to control some important squares. } 8. cxd4 {Here is the first important position of this game. Black has to decide how to unravel his pieces and there are a lot of possible lines for white to attack. White is still down a pawn, or course but is ready to begin an attack. The a5 bishop is controlling e1, so the rook can't come into there if white can open the center, and the threat of Qb3 is such that the c8 bishop is kind of stuck. Interesting position though, and one of the reasons I like the Evan's gambit. Lots of ways for black to go wrong. } Nge7 {Potentially getting ready to castle and developing. This move seems kind of odd to the eye, but Bf6 doesn't really work because it allows white to play e5 at the right moment with tempo and smash open the center with likely tactics to go along with it. } 9. Ng5 {I think this is probably the best move in the position, though I did also consider Qb3 and some other normal looking development moves. This prevents black from castling here though because if 9..O-O then 10. Qh5 looks great, threatening mate on h7 and pressuring f7 as well. 10..h6 11. Nxf7 Rxf7 wins the exchange and keeps a very strong attack going. Of course black has to figure out how to deal with the pressure on f7 without castling.} Rf8 {Defending f7. Take a minute and think what you should play. White clearly has a nice position. You could play Qb3 or Qh5 with extra pressure on f7 which is somewhat hard to meet nicely. You could just take on h7 with the knight, for the rook to move, and then repeat the position at material equality. You could just take on f7 anyway, giving two pieces for a pawn and a rook and then play Qh5 at the end to pick up the h7 pawn anyway. Not to mention some Ba3 developing move or e5 trying to smash open the middle. Consider what you'd play and we'll talk about it in a second.} 10. Qh5 {This is what I played. I thought it better than Qb3 because it have the option of taking with the queen instead of taking with the bishop if black doesn't meet this properly. I thought that if g3 then Qxh7 looked great and that I was likely to win an exchange in the worse case scenario. The computer likes Nxh7 here with the idea that 10. Nxh7 Rh8 11. Ng5 Rf8 12. Qh5 is the same but now black can't block with Ng6 so easily. if 12..Ng6 then Nxf7 Rxf7 Qxg6 (not possible right now because the h7 pawn would protect g6) and white is crashing through winning the exchange in a great position instead of in an unclear position. If you think another move works as well let me know in a comment. I'm always looking for interesting ideas in this opening. } d5 {(!?) pretty cool try by black here. In most of these lines I end up winning the exchange but taking on h7 with the knight and winning the rook for that knight. The real question is who is going to have the initiative after the dust settles and this idea opens up some nice squares for the black pieces and gives black a bit of activity. } 11. exd5 {Taking with the bishop allows him to trade the knight for the bishop and keep simplifying, which helps his cause. } Nxd5 12. Nxh7 {(?!) My thought here was that I'm winning an exchange by force, but this allows black to complicate the matter needlessly. Better is to just play a developing move. 12. Nd2 or Bd2 is better (blocking the e1 square from the black bishop so the rook can open up against the king. Remember, material here is dead equal and white has a great attack going. Not that the h1 rook has moved they are not castling any time soon so slow playing is better. Winning exchanges is still a reasonable thing to do though. } Nf6 {Only move. If Rh1 then Bxc4 wins a piece with the pressure still going. } 13. Qe2+ {The computer prefers 13. Nxf6+ Qxf6 14. Ba3. My play on move 12 was to win the exchange and I didn't see anything better so I was still going for my plan. } Qe7 {Blocking with a different piece works out worse. This was a reasonable practical decision by black to give up the exchange and try to survive or win a worse endgame. } 14. Nxf8 {(?) Following through with the plan, but in the worst possible way. This line just gives black too much counterplay and a pawn for the exchange. Taking on e7 was better, and the computer likes some 14. Nxf6+ lines here as well. I never considered them. } Qxe2 15. Bxe2 Nxd4 {This is why taking on f8 was not a great idea first. Now if I let black grab the bishop with check I'm almost certainly worse. As it is I'm still better, but only by the slimmest of margins. I won the game in the opening and now I have to win it again in the middlegame. } 16. Bd3 {Only move. Allowing Nc2 would be crazy and black would be a pawn up in an ending. } Kxf8 {Finally recapturing the material. Sensible. } 17. Bb2 {Developing with tempo. } Bb6 {Taking the eye off the e1 square seems questionable but perhaps if Nc6 taking on f6 to gain an outside passed pawn was something black didn't want to allow. In either case they have to do something. } 18. Re1 {Taking the newly vacated sqare and keeping the king locked in out that side. Developing with Nd2 also seems fine. } Be6 {Developing} 19. Nc3 {And white finishes development. Black was a rook move will also finish their development. The opening battle is complete and, with the exchange of queens the game has skipped over some sort of middle game. So, as this series is an examination of the opening, what has transpired and what is the material balances and plans in the position for both sides?   White is an exchange up and is well developed with a nice safe king. For that, black has a pawn, which is a potentially strong passed pawn on the c-file. They are also well developed and their potentially weaker king position might be a strength because queens are off. White is better and want to trade some minors, pressure the b and c pawns with rooks, and try to cut off black's counterplay and so play for a win or draw. Black has a nice b6 bishop and could try to pressure the f2 pawn. Or they could put the rook on the h-file and try to get an attack against the white king. Knights are also tricky pieces and so they should always be on the lookout for tactics and forking variations. So a reasonable opening where white is better but clearly still has some work to do and there are issues in the position to be aware of. } Rd8 {Centralizing, and with the d3 bishop unguarded, giving the option for some discovered attack in the future with tactics to come. } 20. Na4 {My thought is to trade of the very strong b6 bishop to alleviate pressure on f2} Nf3+ {(?!) Now Black entered into a very forcing sequence that, in my opinion, was a mistake. First of all this trade of the knight for bishop, while good, is not as good as it might be able to be in the future. The threat of the discovery is stronger than the execution. Also all the simplifications benefit white by trading down to a better endgame. Black really wants to keep some complexity in the position and trade in a more favorable way. It's possible they thought they were winning the f3 pawn at the end of it all, which would have made it worth it} 21. gxf3 Rxd3 {The point of Nf3+} 22. Nxb6 {Taking away the very strong bishop. } axb6 {Taking with the c-pawn seems like a mistake as one of black's long term ideas is to push the passed c-pawn to create counterplay. } 23. Re3 {Protecting f3 and trying to trade a pair of rooks. } Rd2 {Again black wants to keep some play in the position or they are just in a worse/losing endgame. } 24. Bxf6 {It might seem like a poor choice to trade a reasonably strong bishop for a knight that doesn't have a bunch of great squares but it has a very concrete idea. It doubles blacks pawns and so creates in outside passed pawn. The h-pawn can now march down toward royalty and give black fits trying to defend it. } gxf6 25. a4 {Right now black is threatening to win the a-pawn and so have 3 connected passers and suddenly great winning chances. } f5 26. Rc3 {trying to provoke weaknesses. Really at this point my idea was to tie black up defending pawns and then march my king in and win by queening. } Rd7 27. Rac1 c5 28. Rb1 Rd6 29. Kg2 c4 30. Kg3 {Black is running out of reasonable moves. } Kg7 31. Kf4 {The king is now quite active and the open g-file could give some nice attacking ideas as well. } Rd2 {(!?) getting active. This allows white to trade the f and h pawns for the b pawns and then just push the a pawn all the way home. The situation is quite bad for black though and maybe this incites white to try to protect. } 32. Rxb6 {Of course no Rf1 and suddenly defending passively. } Rxf2 33. Rxb7 Rxh2 34. Ra3 {The reason why white is willing to give up two pawns including an outside passer for two doubled pawns. Rook behind the pawn is a winning idea and here the rook in the dark square can never be attacked. The rest is a matter of technique. } Rh8 35. a5 Ra8 {Trying to set up a fortress. } 36. a6 Bc8 37. Rb6 {This also cuts off the third rank so the king can never get active. } Be6 38. a7 Kf6 {The point of the previous move but black is lost. } 39. Rb8 {Black has very few tries here. } Bd5 40. Rxa8 {Trading rooks means white is just going to win all of the pawns and push the f-pawn to victory. If the bishop ever tries to defend then the pawn will queen.} Bxa8 41. Ra4 Ke6 42. Rxc4 Kd7 43. Rc3 Bb7 44. Ra3 Ba8 45. Kxf5 Kc7 46. Kf6 {And black resigns. If they try to take the f-pawn then white can win with a rook and king vs a king. Very likely I didn't find the absolute best line in the endgame (one of my weaknesses) but it seems like a reasonable practical decision. One of the reasons that I like the Evan's gambit is that black's best defenses normally give back material and white can play even material with a better position or, as in this game, go into an endgame an exchange up. }
