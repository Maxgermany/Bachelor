1. e4 {A random win with a random move. I was not expecting this game to end that soon but it worked out and it was fun trying out a few things to provoke White into different positions (not many though)  The royal opener} e5 {I thought for a moment about starting with something completely weird like h5 to throw White off, but then thought that would probably throw me off too...lol  Standard response} 2. Nf3 {Knight's game} Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {Clop Clop! 4 Knights game} 4. d3 Bc5 5. Be2 d6 6. Bg5 Be6 {We're both focused on development so far} 7. O-O {Aha! As soon as my opponent castles my gears start working overtime. I usually just wait until the castle because more often than not my attack gets spoiled by a well-timed castle.} h6 {So I start pushing pawns on the king side} 8. Be3 {h6 pawn is scary...muhahaha  Lol anyway not much white can do here I suppose} g5 {Pushing pawns...my intention to either get an open file or get the pawns all the way to the castle (ICBM on the way)} 9. Nxg5 {Great! open h file with a rook already there.} hxg5 10. Bxg5 Qe7 {Preparing to castle Queenside so i can get my other rook into action} 11. Kh1 {Probably to free up the f2 pawn, though i think at this point white should've probably pulled the DSB back to e3 to unpin the f2 pawn, or move the h2 pawn to h3 to prevent Rxh2 (which black could use to gain tempo)} O-O-O 12. f4 {Backing up the DSB} Ng4 {Until this point I had not seen this tactic (heavily dependent on White not seeing it either...but since I was trying to blow the castle I figured I might as well go along with it)} 13. Bxe7 {White didn't see it either...} Rxh2# {Kaboom!  Thanks to taud for a great game, and thank you to anyone who reads and/or gives constructive comments!  Cheers! :)}
