1. d4 c5 {Sean C likes queens opening whilst normally a d5 or nf6 man thought i'd have a bash at c5} 2. e3 cxd4 3. exd4 d5 {We have managed to get to the Caro-Kann/Exchange variation} 4. c4 Nf6 5. Bg5 {The computer called this inaccurate, i tend to agree.} e6 6. Nf3 Be7 7. Nc3 {Well into than Caro/Kann/Panov attack now about even.} O-O {Quite proud of the castle here was best move and castling is often dangerous if timed wrong} 8. Bd3 h6 {Apparently dxc4 or nc6 are mainline however, the computer likes this, I think these types of move (a3,h3,h6,a6), are often done at the wrong time but people almost do the automatically  without looking. This one i think is about right.} 9. Bh4 Nc6 10. O-O Nb4 11. a3 {Computer calls this an inaccuracy,  I will refer to my 8.. e6 comment, Allows me to take white bishop and force the shape a bit.} Nxd3 12. Qxd3 dxc4 {He now has an IQP} 13. Qxc4 b6 14. Rfd1 Bb7 15. Rd2 Nd5 16. Bxe7 Qxe7 17. Re1 Qd8 18. h3 {Computer does not like this either (See earlier comments), Another free move in effect can I use it?} Rc8 19. Qb3 {Blunder, a piece will be lost} Nxc3 {I think white should consider just ignoring maybe ne5, computer says retake but don't take bishop. Yes a peice down but still have decent struture} 20. bxc3 Bxf3 21. gxf3 Qg5+ 22. Kf1 Qxd2 {Game over, }
