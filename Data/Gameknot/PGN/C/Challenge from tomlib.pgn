1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 {I thought we were heading to a four pawns game which OldGus just finished a mini-tournament.} d6 5. f3 {I'm not familiar with this move} O-O 6. Be3 {White is developing nicely here and Black needs to get moving} b6 {I'm trying to get my light squared Bishop into the game} 7. Bd3 Bb7 8. Nh3 Nc6 9. a3 a5 {Black is quickly running out of moves and I need to get some room} 10. O-O Ba6 {A second move of the light squared Bishop but Black is really backed up at this point} 11. Nf2 e6 {11. ... e5 12. d5 and Black falls further back into arrears} 12. f4 {Now suddenly it is sort of a Four Pawns game} Rb8 13. b4 {A Five Pawns game?} axb4 14. axb4 {14. ... Bb7 15. b5 Ne7 16. Ra7 and White is really bearing down on Black and in such a cramped position it is only a matter of time until it crumbles} Nxb4 {So, I decided to act boldly} 15. Ra4 {15. Rxa6 Nxa6 and some of the tension is released} Nxd3 16. Rxa6 Nxf2 17. Bxf2 Ra8 18. Rxa8 Qxa8 {I ended up a pawn up after the smoke cleared and but my position is still cramped and my pieces are not in play for the most part} 19. Re1 Bh6 20. e5 Nh5 21. g3 {21. exd6 Nxf4 22. dxc7?? Qxg2# Although this move opens up the insanely lovely a8-h1 diagonal for my Queen. Old Gus suggests that I could have forced a draw along this line by eventually moving Qf3} Ng7 22. Qb3 Qa5 23. Re2 Qa7 {This lost the game for me. Much better is 23. ... Qa8 reestablishing the long diagonal or even 23. ... Ra8 } 24. Ra2 {Now I cannot control the a-file and doom comes quickly} Qb7 25. exd6 cxd6 {Probably better is 25. ... c6 26. c5 b5} 26. c5 {Not much left for Black here} dxc5 27. dxc5 Ra8 {I'm hoping for a Rook trade and then to somehow blockade the b-pawn after cxb6 but it is hopeless at this stage} 28. Qxb6 Rb8 29. Qxb7 Rxb7 {Now I lose material and the c-pawn is all but unstoppable} 30. Ra8+ Ne8 31. Rxe8+ Kg7 32. c6 {32. ... Rc7 33. Bb6 and the Rook is lost with the c-pawn to promote shortly afterwards so I resigned. I didn't take advantage of my Queen's excellent position to force the game on my opponent and then my undeveloped pieces could not come to my aid when White moved into an attacking position.}
