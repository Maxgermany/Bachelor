1. e4 {I played, again, with Inasfour. The first game was commentated, in this game, both repeat openingÂ´s line. How I analyzed the first game with Fritz, the PC gives me a new line and I can play that.} e6 {French defence, I play this defence when I want play strong (not for funny).} 2. d4 {2 d4 it`s typiccal. White take the center} d5 {and black challenges} 3. e5 {3 Nc3 and 3 Nd2, are the "figthing alternative". 3 exd5 goes to a symetricall structure of pawns. } c5 {Atacking to the base of chain`s pawn.} 4. c3 {Now, White creates another chain`s pawn. b2-c3-d4-e5. Thus, blacks had more space in queenside now. White creates the space in the kingside with 3 e5.} Nc6 {More pressure to d4} 5. f4 {This move, how I says in the another game, is not frequently. Threating f5, what is the typpical attack to the black chain`s pawn. But Nimzovich says what White aren`t why play this move now. I think what white is begining  a slow plan, when need the development after what a pawn` storm. Common is 5 Nf3.} Qb6 {Atacking d4 and pressure b2. Another typiccal moves} 6. Nf3 Nh6 {Repeat last game. 6 ... h5 to not allows g4, to my juice, it`s so slow and weaking the kingside.} 7. Bd3 {Allows the short castle. } Bd7 {Obviusly, black can`t take in d4. } 8. Bc2 Rc8 9. a3 {White forget your development. If plays f4 to attacks the kingside and now moves 9 a3 to gain space in queenside, white take to ambiciosus plan without development. Bishop moves twice times and white plays six moves of pawn in nine moves. } Be7 {Allows the short castle and threating f6.} 10. b4 {This move, consequently with a3, it`s another pawn`s move. White take more space but the pieces in the queenside are sleeping. } cxb4 {Not 10 ...c4, close the queenside. Thus 10 ... cxb4 or 10 ... cxd4?I choice this move because now white have two choice, retake with c or a pawn. If I plays 10 ... cxd4 White olny retake with c pawn (or take with Knigth but 11 Nxd4 Nxd4 12 cxd4). Now, white can choice open the c-column or a-column. } 11. axb4 {In last game, I analyzed 11 ... Nxb4. But does not good, but 12 cxb4 Qxb4+ 13 Kf2! and no more attack. (13 ... Ng4+ 14 Kg3 h5 15 h3). Another variants are in the another game.} O-O 12. O-O f6 {A interesant move, I think what White need movilize the queenside, 13 Be3 are an alternative or 13 Qe2 and 14 Be3, if white don`t like the bishop "hanging". } 13. h3 {Another move of a pawn, when all the black pieces are movilized.} fxe5 {Opening the column. } 14. fxe5 {14 fxe5 or 14 Nxe5? With this move, bishop in c1 can plays to the kingside} Nf5 {Do not allows 15 Bxh6.} 15. Qd3 {Threating Qxh7+ before g4.} Nxb4 {Now, in the last game, plays 15 ... g6 and before 16 g4 I played Nfxd4, with adventage (see the game :D). In the posterior analysis, with the Fritz, the engine gives me this move. When I see what my rival repeat with my the variant, I hope what he (or she) analyzed the position and introduces a better move. May be, he hopes what I plays 15 ... g6, again. But in the annotated game, I wrote this recommendation to the engine. Now, the black pieces will falling how a storm in the center and kingside.} 16. cxb4 Bb5 17. Qd2 {Well, Fritz gives me 17 Qd1 in the analysis to the anterior game, thus I now plays myself moves. But, I must recognised what I know what black has adventage for the engine. Thus, I only must want the winner variation.} Nxd4 {Specullating with the Bc2 and Rf1. Both rooks puts pressure to the white position. } 18. Rf2 {Well, what can White choice? 18 Qe3 Rxc2 with the threat Bxf1, Rxc1 or Ne2+-f3+. The double check it`s so danger. If 18 Nxd4 Rxf1+. 18 Qxd4 Qxd4 19 Nxd4 Rxf1+ 20 Kh2 Rxc1 } Ne2+ {Cutting Rook-Queen connection. I think what this move it`s better what 18 ... Rxc2. I forced the game now.} 19. Kh2 {If 19 Kf1 Bh4 threating Qxf2++ and isn`t possible 20 Nxh4 Qxf2++. The alternative  20 g3 Bxg3 and again white is lost. 21 Qe3 Nxc1+.} Qxf2 20. Na3 Rxf3 {The end, if white do not allows the mate in g1 with 21 Bb2 Rxh3 22 Kxh3 Qg3++ }
