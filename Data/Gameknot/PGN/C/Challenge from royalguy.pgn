1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Bd3 {Bd3 I feel this is a departure from standard Siclian play - would have expected Be3 - Yugoslav attack} Bg7 {continuing with standard Dragon } 7. O-O O-O 8. Nd5 {Nd5 somewhat of a surprise - not part of the white response to the dragon that I expected} Nxd5 {With the white bishop blocking the queen, should win a knight} 9. exd5 Bxd4 10. Be3 Bf6 {missed an opportunity, could had done Bxb2} 11. Bh6 Re8 12. Re1 Bxb2 {if Rb1, then Bc3} 13. Bb5 Bd7 {don't want to trade rooks  } 14. Bxd7 Nxd7 {gets the knight out} 15. Rb1 {up 4, content with trading Bishop for a Bishop - gets the qN developed  } Bc3 16. Re3 Qc8 {don't like the queen defending both a bishop and a pawn, want to do b6 asap } 17. Rb3 Bf6 18. Reh3 Nc5 {I feel that Nc4 is a good outpost - N can't be chased by a pawn, also forces a move by white } 19. Rb4 b6 {somewhat of a timid move - probably better moves available - was locked into freeing up the Q but b6 wasn't required } 20. Rf3 Qd7 {Wanted to get Q off the back rank} 21. Rbf4 {Rf4 causes me great consternation.  While Rxf6 is unprofitable for White, it does create pressure I could do without.   I feel that the next move is pivotal toward the outcome of the game, lots of bloody scenarios but I am ahead.  In the upcoming exchanges, I feel I will lose a pawn but will still be ahead  } g5 {Will probably lose a pawn but seems to be lessor of evils } 22. Rf4f5 Ne4 {get some more defense for the g pawn} 23. Qd4 {somewhat of a surprise - is this a blunder? - expected Qe1 - pressures the Knight but Queen is safe} Bxd4 {will take the Queen} 24. Rf5xf7 {losing a pawn for a queen - will take that exchange.  While doubled rooks spook me, especially with the bishop on h6, I see this as a threat I can survive.  Rf8 would be a disaster for me.} Qb5 {Qb1# first move I am not in check} 25. Rg7+ {Rg7+?  Is this another blunder. Did not see Bxg7 at first.  Was thinking Kh8 but Bxg7 looks better. This has been a very good dragon bishop - captured a pawn, Queen, and about to capture a Rook while only giving up a pawn} Bxg7 {If he recaptures Bxg7,  Qb1#checkmate, if h3, not sure if Bxh6 or Be5 to cut off king escape White resigns}
