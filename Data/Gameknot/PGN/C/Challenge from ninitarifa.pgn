1. e4 d6 {Pirc Defense.} 2. d4 c5 {Black generally responds with Nf6.} 3. d5 e5 4. Bb5+ {I don't know why white doesn't play dxe6 e.p. very often here.  Nc3 is the most common response to e5, but Bb5+ is good too.} Bd7 5. Bxd7+ Nxd7 6. Nc3 g6 7. Qd3 Bh6 8. Bxh6 Nxh6 9. Qe3 g5 10. Nh3 f6 11. O-O-O Qa5 12. f4 Ng4 {A move fraught with promise, but easily parried.} 13. Qf3 Nh6 {h5 would have protected the knight.  That was a nice spot for it.  On the other hand, 14. fxg5 fxg5 leaves 15. Qf5, and black would wish she had not wasted 11. Qa5.  Actually, white would probably play 15. Nxg5.  Black's withdrawal leaves her in a leakier boat with 14. fxg5 anyway.} 14. fxg5 Nf7 15. gxf6 O-O-O 16. g4 Kc7 {The king seemed fine where he was.  I would have tried b5, maybe get Nc3 to move.} 17. g5 b5 {Yes.} 18. Qd3 b4 19. Qb5 Qxb5 20. Nxb5+ Kb6 21. a4 Rhg8 {Pa6 gives black a white knight, possibly in exchange for the d6 pawn (NxNd6).} 22. Rhg1 Ka5 {Pa6 was still a good move.} 23. b3 a6 {It isn't so much now, because the black king no longer covers c7 or a7.  White will likely choose a7.} 24. Na7 {The king must move back to b6, or white will fork the king and rook with Nc6.} h6 {:(  Knight dines on rook.} 25. Nc6+ Kb6 26. Nxd8 Nxd8 27. Rdf1 h5 {Wait, white WANTS to play Pf7.} 28. f7 Rf8 {White will move Pg6 to protect the pawn, then threaten the rook with Pg7.  Black is in a shambles.} 29. g6 Kc7 30. g7 {Oh the humanity!} Nxf7 31. gxf8=Q Nxf8 32. Rxf7+ Nd7 33. a5 {Here white would be better off playing Rgg7.  This would slaughter the black knight, and probably end the game quite quickly. } Kd8 34. Rg8+ {}
