1. e4 {Hi everyone, I'm annotating a recent game that I really enjoyed. A short game, it demonstrates the importance of well positioned pieces and how they can work together beautifully.  This is my first annotation, feel free to leave a comment..} e5 {Standard textbook, OK with me as I like to have many options available from this position.} 2. Nf3 {Bringing the faithful king's knight out...} d6 {Defending his e pawn, opening for the bishop. } 3. Nc3 {Theres no rush to castle and I like bringing the knights out early.. } h6 {Not sure about this move..? I think development would have been more beneficial...} 4. Bc4 {Looking for a sound position on the board. } c6 {Probably hoping for attack to gain d5 but what about development? } 5. O-O Nf6 {a good move } 6. d4 {I want the centre...} Qe7 {Bringing the queen out early...later proves to be a mistake } 7. dxe5 dxe5 {My queen patiently waits for her opportunity ...} 8. a4 Nh7 {I would've expected ... bg4} 9. b3 Qf6 {Opening for the bish,  but dangerous for Her Majesty ...} 10. Bb2 Be7 {Getting ready to castle.. I have other ideas...} 11. Ne2 {The calm before the storm...} Bg4 {I was waiting for ... Bg4 but now it is too late!} 12. Bxe5 {The warzone is now open for battle!} Qg6 {The only safe place for royalty ...} 13. Nf4 {Not anymore!} Qxe4 {As predicted the queen is forced to flee here} 14. Re1 {Its quite interesting how all the pieces work harmoniously together ...} Qf5 {Again I have control over the queen, she must retreat } 15. Bxg7 {Preventing castling, attacking the rook and dominating ranks d and e... I had a lot of fun in this game} Rg8 {Protecting the rook but I haven't finished yet...} 16. Qd6 {Threatening mate at e7 and bishop is pinned by my rook!} Qd7 {Only the queen can save the game. Hoping for an exchange but why would I want to stop now?!} 17. Bxf7+ {If the king takes it's gameover...} Kd8 18. Qxh6 {And there you have it! Black resigns as although I'm only 2+ in material so far, the outcome is in my favour due to positioning and inevitable gain for me. I really enjoyed this game thankyou branneke ( I like your puzzles too!). To everyone else I hope you enjoyed the game as much as I did!! Cheers, Bianca }
