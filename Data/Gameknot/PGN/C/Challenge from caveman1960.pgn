1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bf4 Qa5+ 12. Bd2 Bb4 13. c3 Be7 14. c4 Qc7 15. O-O-O Ngf6 16. Kb1 O-O 17. Ne4 Rad8 18. Nxf6+ Nxf6 19. Qe2 c5 20. Bc3 cxd4 21. Bxd4 Bc5 {Book to here. The position is given as +=/= for white which Houdini agrees with.} 22. Bxf6 {A Novelty to me and not in any of my databases though it has probably been played before. I like this move of Les's as it puts us on our own resources and introduces an other imbalance into the position NvB. Houdini gives it -0.06.Usual is Bxc5 with about equal chances,} gxf6 {White has the better pawn structure 3 pawn islands to 1 and a Q-side pawn majority. The h pawn may find itself a little exposed as the g pawn may become along the g file.White has two plans to consider . A K-side attack and a q-side advance in the endgame.} 23. g4 {Going for the King. Houdini gives this a -0.24 preferring 23.Nd2 maintaining the status quo.} Rxd1+ {Worried about the King black decides to simplify and exchange pieces. Houdini prefers 23....Qf4 -0.27.My move was its second choice at -0.25} 24. Rxd1 Rd8 {Continuing to offer exchanges. Houdini prefers 24....Qf4 -0.18 over the move played 0.00.} 25. Rxd8+ {Best according to Houdini.} Qxd8 {Time to take stock. With the exchange of a pair of major pieces the threat of a successful K-side attack has diminished. Houdini gives the position as dead equal or more precisely equal chances. Though white has 2 pawn islands to blacks 3 and a q-side pawn majority the exposed white k-side pawns makes it about level pawn wise. The imbalance of Bishop an Queen v.Knight an Queen is interesting. Capablanca's Theorem as espoused in Steve Mayer's book "Bishop v Knight" was that queen and knight are superior to queen and bishop in the endgame. Being that a queen and knight working smoothly together can create a greater number of threats than queen and bishop.} 26. Nh4 {Trying to generate an attack on the king.Houdini and I preferred 26.Nd2 -0.00 compared to the game move -0.64} Qd4 {My plan here was to exchange queens as I mistakenly thought the bishop would be far superior in the minor piece and pawn ending. What both les and I both missed was the tactical shot 26......Bxf2 winning a pawn -0.64 compared to the played-0.36} 27. f3 Qf2 {Forcing the Q exchange and continuing with my plan. My move wasn't in Houdini's top 3 choices, it preferred in descending order 27....Qg1  27.....f5 27......a5.However I still prefer my choice though 27....f5 looks interesting. Houdini considers the move I played an error changing the evaluation from -0.36 to =0.25 for white.} 28. Qxf2 Bxf2 29. Ng2 Kg7 {Moving the king closer to the action and planning to break up white's k-side pawns with f5.+0-22. Houdini also considers 29....f5 +0.22 and 29....kf8 +0.24} 30. Kc2 {My preference was for 30.Nf4+0.26 but Les's move activating the king is as good +0.21} f5 {Preparing a temporary pawn sac to break up whites k-side pawns. Houdini's 1st choice as well +0.21 30....Bg3 +0.25  30....b6 +0.29} 31. gxf5 {Best (+0.21 31.Nf4-0.11 31.b4 -0.11) otherwise black swaps pawns and gets rid of the double pawn for nil effort and k-side access to whites pawns with his king.} Kf6 {Allowing a temporary pawn sacrifice but preventing N-f4-d5 +0.37. Houdini preferred 31....exf5 +0.21 which I didn't like because I thought 32.f4 would slow my k-side play down too much against whites soon to be mobile pawn majority.} 32. fxe6 fxe6 33. Kd1 {Losing time and heading in the wrong direction +0.00.I thought 33.Kd3 was better +0.30 Houdini 33.Nf4 +0.43} Kg5 34. Ke2 Bg3 35. c5 Kxh5 {At this point I mistakenly thought I had a win wrapped up. Passed K-side pawn superior minor piece. Houdini +0.01. A position which I shall p0st in a club forum and see if I can get master input.} 36. b4 {Getting the Q-side majority rolling. -0.05. Houdini preferred 36.Ne3 Kg5 37.Nc4 Kf5 +0.00} Bc7 {Moving the bishop before white could play f4 cutting it of from the q-side +0.00. Houdini prefers 36.....Kg5 -0.07} 37. Ne3 {To help get the q-side pawns moving and planning to use the king to stop the h pawn -0.02} Kg5 38. Nc4 h5 {Getting my passed h pawn moving' Surely a win for black I thought. Houdini +0.00 obviously knew better.} 39. Kf2 {Houdini +0.00. I think I would have played 39.Nd6 +0.00.} e5 {Worried about an impending Nd6 I played e5 to allow the K easy access to the d6 square +0.00} 40. a4 {Continuing the plan to get the Q-side pawns rolling -0.07. Houdini prefers 40.Ne3 +0.00  40.Nd2 -0.02 } h4 {Houdini gives 40.......Kf5 as better -0.05, the move played +0.00} 41. Nd6 {Played now this turns out to be an error -4.67 that was overlooked by both Les and myself. Houdini gives both 41.b5 +0.00 and 41.Ne3 +0.00 as maintaining equality.} Bxd6 42. cxd6 Kf6 43. d7 Ke7 {Black incorrectly agreed a draw in this position due to the line 44.d8=Qch Kxd8 45.Kg2 Kd7  46.Kh3 Kd6 47.Kxh4 Kd5 48.Kg4 -0-75   45......b5 -8.85 wins easily. Back to some endgame training it's obviously needed.}
