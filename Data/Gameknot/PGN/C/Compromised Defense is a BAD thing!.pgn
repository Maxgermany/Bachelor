[Opening "Evans gambit (C52), compromised defence, Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 {"Hey Dewars, long time no see!"} e5 {"Hi Ethan, you remember our last game?"} 2. Nf3 {"Yeah, it was a wild Marshall Gambit position; I had sacced a knight to expose your king, and in a very unclear position, I offered you a draw, and you took it."} Nc6 {"Want to try the Marshall again?"} 3. Bc4 {"No, I'd like to try out this old Italian Game opening.  I used it to beat this robertb3079 guy* once and I'm going to try playing it more as White."  * - Robertb3079 is embarrassingly better than me.} Bc5 {"Think you have the guts to play the Evans gambit?"} 4. b4 {"Oh really fool?  You want a free pawn?  Go on, take it, you know Bb6 is for total cowards!" (Bb6 declines the gambit, but is totally inferior to Bxb4.)} Bxb4 {"<Munch!>  Got any more free pawns for me?"} 5. c3 {"I'm all ready for you here, get back to a5!"  (a5 is a superior square for the bishop to either e7 (very passive) or c5, where the bishop gets hit by d4.)} Ba5 {"Hey, white King, are you over there singing 'I've got a feelin' somebody's watchin' me?'"} 6. d4 {"I ain't afraid just cuz you're up a pawn, go ahead and take that pawn, too!" (It is more important in this opening for white to grab space than to worry about pawns.  If white can emerge better developed with active pieces and clear space for them to maneuver, that should be worth one or two or even three pawns.)} exd4 {"I'll take that pawn."} 7. O-O {"Go on, take a third!"  (This is a risky but, I believe, great move for white.  It unpins the c-pawn, greatly enhances development and *dares* black to do the unsound thing and play dxc3.)} dxc3 {"dxc3 isn't unsound!  It's in my MCO!"} 8. Qb3 {"Dude, it's called the 'compromised defense'!  That's got to be a bad thing!"  (There is a famous game, Fisher vs. Fine, at http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1043992 where white makes black PAY for this.  And it's not some patzer, it's Reuben Fine!  I remember after seeing that game a long time ago just realizing that white has so much space, so many attacking chances, while black's king is stuck in the center, his bishop is offside, and his only other developed piece is an Nf6.  Now, he's got to address the threat of Bxf7.)} Qf6 {! "If you think it's unsound, prove it!"  (Qf6 is a much better move than Qe7, as played in Fisher vs. Fine, and so I need to think of a way to counter this.)} 9. e5 {"Oh yeah, well I WILL prove it!  Run, queenie, run!"  (I had gone and looked through the game databases, and saw that there are a number of lines, and the ones that looked promising for white were 9. e5 Qg6 10. Nxc3 Nge7, where white then has the option of 11. Ne2, Ba3, or Rd1.  The 11. Ba3 line looked cute because there is this game http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1227846 available to model my play off of. I made some moves in silence and then decided...)} Qg6 10. Nxc3 Nge7 11. Bb2 {! "Oh, crap dude!  I think I just invented a superior line to everything that's out there!  They're going to name it the Siegel variation and I'm going to crush you with it!"  Why do I say this?  Because after 11. Ba3, black castles with 0-0, and what does white have?  12. Ra-d1 Re8 13. Bd3 Qh5, and white would love to play Ne4, but the e-pawn is hanging!  What if I played 11. Bb2 instead of 11. Ba3?  Well, wouldn't I just be one tempo ahead of where I would be had I played 11. Ba3?  I think so!  How awesome is that?  "Evans Gambit, Compromised Defense, Siegel Variation -- far superior to the Paulsen Variation!"  IN YOUR FACE LOUIS!} O-O {"Well, if you're inventing new variations that are that good, maybe you wouldn't be rated only 88 points higher than me, dolt!" (Sorry Dewars, I'm making your whole side of this imaginary conversation UP!)} 12. Rad1 {"Oh yeah?  Well, umm... I'll reinvent you... to... umm... having... a losing record! Against me!"  Slapping the Potter variation, which is 11. Rfd1, in the face.  That's how it goes, graderguy taught me, think a long time about which rook to move.  Then move the other one.} Re8 {Sure you will.  Watch me grab this half-open file.  Whatcha gonna do?  (When your wife divorces and sues you?  Hulkamaniac.)} 13. Bd3 {"Hey queen, where you gonna run to now (where you gonna go?)"} Qh5 {"I'm goin' down to h5 baby, way down to Mexico-way!"} 14. Ne4 {!  And look at what I can play now!  Ne4!  And now black CAN'T respond Nxe5, because I played 11. Bb2 instead of 11. Ba3.  What do you really good guys who read this think?  You know who I'm talking to, ion, rob, marin, and you folk!  Is 11. Bb2 an improvement to this line?  I'm certainly liking my position here...} d5 {"I'm certainly envying your position here!"} 15. exd6 e.p. {<Yoink!>} Be6 {You think you scare me, tempoing my queen like that?} 16. Bc4 {"You think you scare me, tempoing my queen like that?"  After the exchange of bishops, which is black's only option, he must still deal with the pawn on d6, plus my queen is more active on c4 than b3.} Bxc4 17. Qxc4 cxd6 {Probably best.  Still, the storm is still coming...} 18. Nxd6 {Obvious but strong!  Let's take stock here.  Black has played, objectively, pretty well.  There are no major problems with any of his moves to this point, *except*, I would argue, 7. dxc3.  He's now only up one pawn, his pieces are hiding on the sides, he has no presence in the center, and his Re8 and pawn on b7 are currently forked.  His position is a wreck, and it seems to me that 7. ...dxc3 is the culprit.  Therefore, I have to conclude that the compromised defense is a failure of an opening.  The rest of the game isn't perfect, but I play well enough to turn this into a victory.} Ref8 {A safer option than Rfb7, since the pressure on f7 is very strong.  Note also how the Nf3 is only one move away from pressuring f7 as well.} 19. Nxb7 {But I choose to even the material score, while still retaining a superior position.} Rab8 {I saw this tactic -- Nxa5 can now be met by either Rxb2 or Nxa5, but white can defend everything.} 20. Nxa5 Nxa5 21. Qc3 {With that pesky bishop off the board, white can make a battery with his queen and dark-square bishop, AND play Rfe1 finally.  The immediate threat of this move is mate on g7. } f6 {Really, this is a tough situation for black.  Qg6 and Qh6 leave the queen open to harassment and the a5 knight hanging, and Nf5 is made embarrassing by Rd5.} 22. Ba3 {I've got to say, I was impressed with how many targets I actually managed to attack in this game!  This attacks the knight and removes the threat on the bishop from Rb8.} Rfc8 {Counterattacking is really black's only chance, but really, everything is threatened by white's menacing pieces.} 23. Qe1 {!  "Why so quiet?  Is it tough to talk trash while you're wallowing in it?"  (This is a powerful square for the queen, as it threatens the Na5, the Ne7, and also threatens to deliver a powerful check with Qe6 )} Ng6 {It's hard to find a good move for black here.  The knight had to move, but perhaps c6 was a better square to move it to, for reasons that will become clear imminently.} 24. Qe6+ {!  Black, I believe, overlooked this.  He would love to bring his queen to f7, with a chance to exchange them, but now he's forced to lock his king in the corner.} Kh8 {I know he's thinking "don't get mated in the corner, don't get mated in the corner"} 25. Rd7 {"I'm going to mate you in the corner, dewars"} Nf8 {"Not if I fork your queen and rook!"} 26. Bxf8 {"What were you saying?"} Rcxf8 {"I've successfully parried all of your threats!  Unsound?  No way!"} 27. Qe7 {"Hey, look, if you don't defend g7, I'm going to checkmate you in the corner!"} Rfg8 {Qg6 or Qh7 are also playable, but not Rf7, which loses immediately to Rd8  with mate to follow.} 28. Rxa7 {Is this a mistake?  Black has Nc6, and will I be forced to drop the exchange?} Nc6 {No, there's a trick... there's got to be!} 29. Qf7 {;-)  Of course.  Black's hanging queen.  So after all the dust settles, white will be in an endgame up an outside passed pawn after Qxf7 Rxf7, and yes, it would've been nice to get a knight to f7 for the smothered mate, but I figure that the way I've played it will lead to a winning endgame for me, and I'll take that.} Nxa7 {???  Could I have missed something?  Does he not just see that I'm going to play Qxh5?} 30. Qxh5 {"Did I overlook something?  Or did you?"} Nc6 {"Well, there was a lot of pressure on me the whole game!  It finally caught up with me; let's see how quickly and elegantly you can finish it."} 31. g4 {"Coming for you down the g-file!"  (Also, the back rank is the only place he can probably mate me, so better protect against that!)} Ne7 {"Consolidating my forces" (I know this is his way of saying "bring it on")} 32. g5 {"Come on, pawn-grabber!  Play fxg5; it's harmless, riiiight?"} Rgf8 {"No, I think I'm done taking pawns for now.  And stop thinking about a smothered mate with Nf7!"} 33. Re1 {"How about giving me a free knight?"  (I would love to play g6, but that's impossible for the immediate moment because of Nxg6.  Nh4 was a move I also considered, but then fxg5 looks like a substantial improvement in position for black.)} Ng6 {"No dice, buddy."  At this point, I realize that if I can exchange off my rook for his knight to play g6, I'm going to have some excellent threats with the pawn and queen and knight in his corner.  Sometimes knights are better than rooks!} 34. Re4 {My first very inefficient move of the game.  I fully admit to playing lazy here, and though I didn't realize until later, it could've cost me!} f5 {"Is your rook scared yet?"} 35. Ne5 {!  (It's just a cute move) "Come on, take the rook!"  (After ...fxe4 36. Nxg6  is decisive for white.)} Kg8 {Honestly, this is probably the best move available, as it seems to prevent Nxg6.} 36. Nxg6 {!?  WHAT?  Seriously, I just played Nxg6 anyway.  Even though he just prevented it.  Why would I do that?  Have I looked deeper?  The answer is yes -- but not deep enough; I just get lucky!} hxg6 {Looks really sketchy, because there's no way to save the queen and the rook.  At this point, dewars says to me:  "Hey!  Now that's some real Southern hospitality!"  Apparently talking about the free rook.} 37. Qxg6 {"Right, southern hospitality.  Enjoy the free rook, it's very tasty!"} fxe4 {Mmm... tasty rook.  White looks like he's in trouble now -- two rooks are usually more than a match for a lone queen.  But, in the end, white's positional superiority carries through EVEN TO THIS ENDGAME, and I get to say back...} 38. Qe6+ {"Enjoying the Southern hospitality?"  Black only has three legal moves to choose from here:  38. ...Rf7? loses to 39. g6, and the rook falls.  38. ...Kh8? loses to 39. g6 Rf8-moves and there is no good defense to 40. Qh3  Kg8 41. Qh7  Kf8 (why the Rf8 has to move) 42. Qh8  Ke7 and then either 43. Qxb8 (if the Rf8 moved to somewhere else on the f-file) or 43. Qxg7 , mopping up the other black pawns and winning with unstoppable passed pawns.  38. ...Kh7 is black's only hope, and even then, white has 39. Qxe4 , where black still has to contend with an overwhelming white position, but if there is a line of escape for black, it resides in this line, and could turn my initial !? on 36. Nxg6 into a ?! if there is a way out.} Kh8 {But in any case, it's moot, since black obviously missed white's murderous response...} 39. g6 {g6!  I think that Qh3  is strong here, too...} Rbe8 {...but Qh3  forces Kg8, and doesn't allow black the opportunity to make a fatal mistake like this.  At this point (no joking this time), dewars thanked me for the 'hospitality' I had given him back.} 40. Qh3+ {"Err... it wasn't that hospitable as much as it was to gain one single tempo."} Kg8 {"nevermind"} 41. Qh7# {Checkmate 1-0.  So thanks to dewars for putting up with my putting *all* of these words into his mouth, and also for allowing me an opportunity to try inventing a new opening variation and to, perhaps, demonstrate that the compromised defense of the evans gambit is something no black player should ever play!  Of course, people will continue to play it anyway, but I think it's really no good... what do YOU think?  Message me or leave me comments and let me know!  -Ethan}
