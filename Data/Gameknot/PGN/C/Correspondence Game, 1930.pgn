[Opening "Budapest (A51), Fajarowicz variation"]

1. d4 {Solid, and usually leading to slow play.} Nf6 {The Indian defense.} 2. c4 {The book reply.} e5 {The Budapest Gambit, a relatively new opening at the time.} 3. dxe5 {The automatic response, then and now.} Ne4 {A rarer variant is 3... N-N5, threatening to win back the Pawn at once.} 4. a3 {To prevent a Black minor piece from occupying QN5.} d6 {Opening a line for the QB and threatening to recapture the gambited Pawn.} 5. exd6 {To preserve his material advantage, White consents to the exchange.} Bxd6 {Now Black has a considerable advantage in development and a centralized Knight in return for the Pawn.} 6. g3 {The game-losing blunder. 6 B-Q2, 6 N-Q2 or 6 N-KR3 would all have prevented Black's winning tactical maneuver. } Nxf2 {Decisive. If the Q moves away, Black wins the Exchange with 7... NxR. If 7 KxN, 7... BxP ch wins the White Q. Warren of course resigns at once.}
