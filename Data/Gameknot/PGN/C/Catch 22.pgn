[Opening "KP (B00), Nimzovich defence"]

1. e4 Nc6 {An opening I have very little experience with... } 2. Nf3 {...so I just focus on my main moves - e4, Nf3, Bc4... } d6 {yup - definitely out of anything I've had experience with } 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Nxe4 {! Both sides seemed to be focusing on developing, but now Black launches an attack... but didn't he just give up his knight?!?! } 5. Nxe4 d5 {'course not! Black has just reintroduced me to a tactic that I had not encountered for a long, long time. Personally, I really hate it when this happens! } 6. Ng3 {!? White could maintain material equality with 6.Bxd5 Qxd5 7.Nc3 Qa5 [this might have been better, but I'm not really sure] but I didn't see that line when I played this move. As for why I decided to save the knight instead of the bishop, there are two reasons for that; 1) after Bb3, dxe4 White has to waste an extra tempo moving the knight again, and 2) I didn't want the pawn in the centre of the board } dxc4 7. b3 {advanced pawns this early in the game always end up being a bit of the bother for me, so I decide to do something about it as soon as possible.... } cxb3 {...but what would I have done if Black hadn't gone through with the capture? if he had advanced the pawn to c3, I would have castled, then taken the pawn, and if Black had not done anything....then I'm not sure what I would have done (bxc doesn't look pretty because of the doubled pawns) } 8. axb3 {looks like the better of the two pawn captures, opening up a file for my rook as well } Bg4 9. Bb2 {Both sides develop their bishop - White with a fianchetto, Black with a pin } Nb4 {?! There is a purpose in this - provoking 10.c3? Nd3+! 11.Ke2 Nxb2, picking up the bishop. [12.Qc2 Nd3 13.Qxd3 Qxd3 14.Kxd3 gets back the piece, but Black is definitely better, an example is 14...0-0-0+] However, Black has just violated one of the opening rules - 'never move a piece twice in the opening' } 10. O-O {White prevents the trick with a simple developing move... } Qd7 {and Black prepares his own castling  } 11. c3 {?! this move was made because of the lack of other obvious moves in this position [the c2 square seems preferable to e1 to break the pin on the f3 knight, and h3 could be met with Bxh3] but, as I explained back at move 9.... } Nd3 {the knight had this square to jump to! now the fianchettoed bishop is threatened with capture! } 12. Ba3 {not as good as the a1-h8 diagonal, of course, but this is still a good diagonal for the bishop } O-O-O {opposite-side castling! let's see how this plays out! :) } 13. Qc2 {Breaking the pin on the knight } Qc6 {hmmm....not too sure what the purpose of this move is about.... better might have been e6 or g6 to open up lines for the dark-square bishop [or Bxf3, now that the queen can't capture back] } 14. Ne1 {White decides that Black's knight have overstayed its welcome on the d3 square, and chases the knight off. The knight is defended once and twice attacked so... } Ne5 {there are two other alternatives to this, as far as I can see. One is defending the knight with the queen, but that would seem like a loss of tempo, given that Black had already moved his queen. The other alternative would be Nxe1, but that lets White occupy the half open file with the rook with tempo, and it threatens the e7 pawn with capture. This move is probably best } 15. h3 {again, I didn't see a lot of choices here, so again, I decide to kick out a Black piece from my side of the board... } Qh6 {? There is sense behind the sacrifice; after the pawn-for-bishop exchange, Black will create a mate threat on the h2 square. White would then play Nf3, and White's weakened kingside defence (on the h-file) would make up for the 1 point material deficit. However, should White be able to immediately quell this attack, it becomes unsound.... } 16. hxg4 Nxg4 17. Qf5+ {! and that is just what White does here, using a weakness in Black's position to repel the attack } e6 {?? forced was Qe6 - now White picks up the knight for free } 18. Qxg4 Bxa3 {connecting the rooks with tempo... this could be a good move in normal conditions, but Black is 4 points down! [or he just saw that White could exchange the bishop anyway) } 19. Rxa3 f5 20. Qa4 {Avoiding the threat, and putting more pressure on the a7 pawn } a6 {natural } 21. d4 {the d-pawn was threatened with capture, and this was the best way to defend it } Rd6 {?! I think Black's next move would have been better off played here... this move turns out to be a problem  later in the game } 22. Nf3 {Bringing my knight to a better square, and possibly eyeing the e5 square as a future knight outpost } g5 {Black starts a pawn storm kingside.... } 23. b4 {while I start one queenside! [not sure if this game is the best example, but this is probably why opposite-side castling leads to exciting play - if both sides attack, it'll all come down to who succeeds first :)] } g4 {Black utilises the only attack he has at this point } 24. Ne5 Rf8 {Black's looking to the future with this move... } 25. b5 {Onward! Of course, the b-pawn is immune because of Qa8# } f4 {Black keeps up the pawn roll... } 26. Ne4 {but White launches a counter-attack on the d6 rook } g3 {? Black is going for all or nothing! I won't give this move a ?? because there is a little logic behind this move - if White gets too confident, there is a chance that he would overlook the attack } 27. Nxd6+ cxd6 {I was confident at this point that I was going to win (naturally) so I was looking for the quickest way to seal the deal... and that almost cost me the game (that has happened to me a couple of times before, and it's always a heavy blow to my 'chess playing morale' when it happens) I was playing round with the idea of Nc4, and had actually put the position on the board... I headed towards the 'submit button'.... then I noticed Qh2# - phew! so I quickly hit the reset button and played... } 28. Nf3 {! saving the knight and covering the mating square, but Black's not finished yet... } Rf5 {for awhile, I actually became worried when I saw this move. Black, here, threatens mate again with Rh5, then Rh1#. The first defence I saw against this was 29.Rd1 Rh5 30.Kf1, but could Black continue the attack with 30...Rh1+... well, it turns out that White never needed to worry about that line in this game... } 29. b6 {! White threatens Qe8#, so Black has to defend against that... } Qh5 {? Kd8 was much better here - Black has just lost his only source of counterplay } 30. Re1 {attacking the e6 pawn, and threatening to get another piece into the attack } Qf7 {In this position, I would not hold it against Martin to resign - what attack does he have left? } 31. c4 {White starts to get his pawns rolling! } h6 32. d5 e5 {32...exd5 } 33. c5 Qe7 {33...dxc5 } 34. c6 Kb8 {It's obvious that Black doesn't really have any plan, but [although Black follows the 'don't trade when behind' rule] he shouldn't have let my pawns get so far into the Black position. Here, Black hopes for c7+, where Kc8 seems to hold the position.... though White now has a spectacular win... } 35. Rc1 {starting with this move - can you see it? } e4 {Black attacks my white knight... } 36. c7+ {following through with the plan } Kc8 37. Qxa6 {!! This was the reason for White's Rc1, and also the reason for the title of this annotation - if Black takes the queen [bxa6], it is mate in 3 - 38.b7+ Kxb7 39.c8=Q+ Kb6 40.Qxa6# [the Rc1 supports the c-pawn] if Black does not take the queen... } gxf2+ {[simply delaying the inevitable] } 38. Kxf2 {If Black does not take the queen, it's still mate! (Martin did admit afterwards that he could have delayed the mate by taking the queen, but it all leads to the same result) } Qd8 39. Qa8+ Kd7 40. Qxd8# {Checkmate! }
