[Opening "Caro-Kann (B17), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 {King's Pawn opening.} c6 {The caro-kann defense} 2. d4 {Standard move grabbing the centre.} d5 {standard book move} 3. Nc3 {The advance variation of the caro-kann (3. e5) is the most popular move here presently. My opponent chose 3. Nc3, the 2nd most popular move here. 3. Nc3 is a perfectly good attempt for white to fight for an advantage.} dxe4 {standard move} 4. Nxe4 {standard move} Nd7 {Nd7 is the modern variation. Former world champion Karpov played Nd7 frequently. The other main move is Bf5 (the classical variation). I play both variations. I don't really have a preference.} 5. Nf3 {standard move} Ngf6 {standard move. Black would like white to exchange Knights allowing his d7 knight to move to f6.} 6. Bd3 {I was happy to see Bd3. It allows me to capture on e4 and bring the knight from d7 to f6 to threaten the bishop. I think 6. Ng3 might be better for white. White may be moving the same piece twice in the opening but its good here. It makes black's development difficult. } Nxe4 7. Bxe4 Nf6 8. Bd3 Bg4 {developing the light squared bishop to the most logical spot.} 9. c3 e6 {protecting the pawn. Bxf3 and pawn/queen capture allows black to capture d4, winning a pawn.} 10. h3 {asking a question to the bishop. Where do you want to go?} Bh5 {Both retreat and capture I think is ok. I played Bh5 so not to give white the bishop pair.} 11. g4 {I was expecting 0-0} Bg6 12. Bxg6 hxg6 {double pawns but a half open file in return. h3 pawn seems weak needing protection from rook,} 13. Bg5 {This move stops black playing Nxg4 hxg4 Rxh1 winning material. At the time I thought the best move was g5. White would followup with Qc2 or Qe2, Bd2 and then 0-0-0. This may or may not be better than the actual game.} Qb6 {Move attacks b2 and renews Nxg4 (hxg4 Rxh1) } 14. Bxf6 {can't stop both threats. Needs to take.} gxf6 15. Qe2 {protects pawn. At this point I was thinking my opponent may move his king to g2 and launch a pawn storm on the queenside if I castle queenside.} O-O-O {Didn't think that plan would work.} 16. O-O-O {This is probably the safe option.} c5 {I was looking for an active move here and decided on c5. Be7 or Kb8 are better moves according to computer analysis} 17. g5 {Knight would like to target weak f7 pawn and fork rooks.} cxd4 18. Qc4+ {if gxf6, Bh6, king moves, dxc3. If white plays Ne5 then Bd2 is very good for black. If white plays Qc4 it is an improvement but still good for black. black can play Bf4 if needed to stop white's knight attacking f7. Queen c4 is best here} Kb8 {if cxd4, Rc8 winning the queen. Knight takes - loses pawn.} 19. Rxd4 Rxd4 20. Qxd4 Qxd4 21. cxd4 {trades leaves white with an isolated pawn. } Be7 22. gxf6 Bxf6 23. Kd2 Rd8 {Rook here stops Ne5. } 24. Ke3 Rd5 25. Ke4 Kc7 26. Rc1+ Kd7 27. b3 b6 28. Rc2 {This rook move protects the pawn on the 2nd rank. It also allows to play knight to e5. It doesn't lose a pawn now because the black king can protect it.} Rf5 {This is a mistake. Rook to h5 is best. I was thinking the h3 pawn could be picked up later. } 29. Ne5+ {Strong knight, need to get rid of it.} Bxe5 30. dxe5 Rh5 {Now I play the move I should have played earlier.} 31. Rd2+ Ke7 32. Rc2 Kd7 {tacit draw offer } 33. Rc3 {white plays on} Rh4+ 34. f4 g5 35. Rf3 Ke7 36. Kd4 gxf4 37. Kc4 a6 38. a4 Rh8 {offers the exchange of pawns} 39. Rxf4 Rxh3 40. Rd4 Re3 41. Rd6 b5+ 42. Kd4 Rxe5 {if Kxe5, f6, picking up rook and easy win for black.} 43. Rxa6 Rd5+ 44. Ke3 bxa4 45. bxa4 f5 46. Ra8 {Plan is for black rook to protect pawns while black king attacks white pawn.} Re5+ 47. Kf3 Kd6 48. a5 Kc6 49. Kf4 Re4+ 50. Kf3 Kb5 51. a6 e5 52. a7 Ka6 53. Rf8 Rf4+ 54. Ke3 Kxa7 55. Rf6 Kb7 56. Re6 Re4+ 57. Kf3 Kc7 58. Rf6 Rf4+ 59. Ke3 Kd7 60. Ra6 Rb4 61. Kf3 Rb3+ 62. Ke2 f4 63. Rf6 Ke7 64. Rf5 Ke6 65. Rf8 Kd5 66. Rf5 Ke4 67. Rh5 f3+ 68. Kf2 Rb2+ 69. Kf1 Kd4 70. Rh4+ e4 71. Rf4 Ke3 {slow grind to promote the pawns. Thanks for the game old_dog. old_dog played a very good game here.}
