1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Qf6 {I don't know a lot of openings in depth. I just decided that I didn't want to cut off my bishop with d6. Trying to prevent doubled pawns. Not the best move, but it was alright} 4. O-O {I found this odd. I would expect them to continue to develop pieces.} a6 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3 Bc5 {Moving the bishop out so that I can get the d pawn out of the way of the white bishop} 7. Nc3 d6 8. d3 Nh6 {My friend said afterwards that he probably would have done Ne7 instead. I really didn't see that, but I was setting up for Ng4 and an attack on the f2 pawn. That never happened because...} 9. Bg5 {of this move. I was a little worried about this, but I only had one move that saved my queen, so I went with that.} Qg6 10. Qd2 f6 {My queen is in a bad position here, but I'm getting the bishop out of the way, so I could move Qg4 and retreat if they don't capture the knight.} 11. Bxh6 gxh6 12. Rae1 Bh3 {I really liked this move, but the computer still says that white is up if they play Nh4. } 13. Bf7+ {Big blunder on White's part. I'm assuming they didn't see Nh4, and thought that I would play Qxf7 then they'd play gxh3, giving them a pawn advantage, although big positional disadvantage.} Kxf7 {Free bishop, and it let's my A rook have access to g8.} 14. Nh4 {Now there's Nh4} Qg4 {Kind of a strange move on my part, but the computer agrees, and it keeps pressure on white.} 15. g3 {Opens the rook to attack, but the rook is trapped, so no need to take it this turn.} Rag8 {Threatening the g pawn more} 16. Kh1 {Now I'll take the rook, because it could move to g2 (although, that might trap the king if they make a mistake).} Bxf1 17. Rxf1 {.} Qh3 {Keeping the pressure up, and getting another attacker on the g pawn. I wanted to get rid of the f pawn some how, because the h pawn isn't actually protecting the g pawn, but I couldn't find a way to do it. Also, Qxf1 would be checkmate.} 18. Rd1 {Preventing the checkmate.} Bd4 {I'm thinking that at the very least I get a pawn, and was hoping for Ne2 bxf2, but I guess that was too much to hope for.} 19. Nd5 {Honestly didn't see this coming. Threatens the d pawn, but I decided just to trade, as the knight wouldn't have much support.} Bxb2 20. c4 {Interesting move. Frankly, I think c3 would've been more annoying, but either way I have to move my bishop.} Bd4 21. Qxh6 {Threatening qxf6+, have to avoid that.} Rg6 {Nxg6 would let me take the queen, so I thought this was a good move, also, the queen either has to retreat back to d7, allowing me to play Rg8, and put even more pressure on the g pawn, or Qh4 or Qc1, letting me take the f pawn} 22. Qh5 Bxf2 {That pawn finally falls.} 23. Nxg6 {Wasn't expecting this.} Qxh5 24. Nxh8+ {Looks like a queen for two rooks, which would be a good play on their part except, their knight has no escape.} Kg7 {I can take the knight whenever I want, and qf3 is checkmate next move, if they don't prevent it.} 25. Kg2 {Foiling the checkmate, but I get the rook anyway.} Qxd1 26. Kxf2 Qxd3 {Score on the trade, I lost 2 rooks and a bishop, White lost a queen, a rook, a pawn, and are going to lose a knight and more pawns.} 27. g4 Qxe4 28. Nxf6 {I'm guessing they were trying to free the other knight.} Qf4+ {Kxf6 would've worked just as well.} 29. Ke2 Qxf6 {White resigns.}
