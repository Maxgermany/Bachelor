1. e4 {here we go again against widow twanky, we always have a good duel.  Quite a quick fire game too.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {ah the old Ruy Lopez} a6 4. Bxc6 {white takes knight messing my pawn structure a little and taking defending piece away from e5} dxc6 5. b3 Bg4 {think I will do a little attacking of my own} 6. h3 Bxf3 {Ruy Lopez exchange variation.} 7. Qxf3 f6 {e5 needs some protection in anticipation of  Bb2} 8. O-O {I now need to think about devloping my pieces quickly} Ne7 9. c4 {twanky starts a queen side attack.  A corridor is now developing down the d file.} c5 {I decided to make use of my doubled pawn and block his advance. The only problem with this move is it hems my bishop in a bit.} 10. Nc3 {white is now building his attack on d5} c6 {opens my queen up and stops is knight advancing to d5 } 11. a3 Ng6 {time to make some space, I'm a bit closed in at the moment} 12. d3 {white opens his bishop up.} Qd7 {my plan here is to attack his pawn on d3 .} 13. a4 Rd8 {I did think about castling queen side here.} 14. Rd1 {White gives his pawn some protection.} Be7 {I should have gone a5. Instead I was thinking of castling} 15. a5 {That is why I should have gone a5. Twanky beat me to it. opening room for his knight to advance to a4} O-O {I thought castling was not a bad idea as his white bishop had gone and the white diagonal was blocked up with pawns. I also had thoughts of advancing my f pawn too.} 16. Ba3 {white spots a weak spot in my defence.  The pawn on c5.  Moving that bishop does enable me to think about moving my knight to f4 attacking d3.  For a few moves now I have been a little concerned about the position of my queen.} Nf4 17. Na4 {white counter attacks.  This next move took me a while to decide.  I really needed to move my queen. moving it to c7 was an option attacking a5.} Nxd3 {But instead decided to attack. A little foolish, as now my knight is pinned and twanky can continue with his attack.} 18. Bxc5 Bxc5 {exchange} 19. Nxc5 {Now decisions need to be made. My queen and knight are being attacked.  No matter what,  I have lost my knight so its damage limitation time.} Nxc5 {I decide to exchange my queen for a rook, knight and control of the open d file.  Not too bad. Twanky at this point asked me if losing my queen was a mistake. } 20. Rxd7 {No a calculated risk. } Rxd7 21. Rb1 {white protects his b pawn so he can move his queen.  I would have considered moving the queen to e3 attacking my knight.} Rfd8 {I double my rooks up ready for my own attack.} 22. b4 {Whites attack is now basesd on the pawns on the queen side.} Rd7d3 {I need to start forcing the moves!  Moving the knight now would only give him more time to attack.} 23. Qg4 {My concern now is the queen getting  in behind at e6.} Nb3 {I did not want to break my two rooks unity therefore my only safe square for my knight is b3.} 24. c5 {white blocks the pawns up but also by advancing that pawn opens my knight to the attack from his queen at e6. I nearly missed that.  } Nd2 {disaster avoided for now.} 25. Rb2 g6 {I decide to make a little breathing room for my King.} 26. Qe6+ {white makes his move. At the same time leaves his e pawn unguarded.  His plan now is to get my pawn defence on the queen side to promote his pawns.} Kg7 27. Qe7+ {another check.  He has my pawns!  I need to do something fast.} Kh6 {King slides away.} 28. Qxb7 Nxe4 {Now my thoughts turn to his king.  With no back rank defence I can smell an opening maybe.} 29. Qxc6 {White continues to clear the way for his pawns. My time is running out.  My knight needs some protection first.} Rd3d1+ 30. Kh2 Re1 31. Qxa6 {and the knight gets it by the rook moving along one. This move allows room for my other rook to join in the attack. Now my knight is safe after the queen greedily takes another pawn. } Rdd1 {Now checkmate is threatened. Re1- h1.  } 32. g4 {white avoids that .} Reh1+ 33. Kg2 {My Knight is now in danger if I continue to attack with my rooks.} Rdg1+ {I'm down by 3 here but about to snatch a couple of pawns back.} 34. Kf3 Ng5+ {Check again. For how long can I stop him advancing his pawns.} 35. Ke2 Rxh3 36. Rc2 {I don't really know why twanky did not decide to advance his b pawn.} Rxg4 {back to -1.  A free move in my view. I thought white might remove my e pawn with his queen too.} 37. Qb7 {but no. I don't really know why twanky made that move. Maybe to protect his pawn but why not advance the pawn. It made me think for a while.  } Re4+ 38. Qxe4 {Never in a month of Sunday's would I have imagined him doing that.  He must be confident about promoting his pawns.} Nxe4 {Bye bye queen.} 39. c6 {Now the race starts.} Nd6 {My knight is my only hope at this point really.} 40. c7 Nc8 {Blockade accomplished for now. Until his other pawns start moving.} 41. Rc5 {white tries to take my rook out of the hunt.} Ra3 {Something for him to think about. Stopping him from advacing his pawns at the moment.  I am now also thinking about bringing my king across.} 42. Rb5 {White plans to attack my knight and promote.} Rc3 {I need to protect my knight.  To do this I attack his c pawn.} 43. Rc5 {I thought he might make this move.   The exchange is to my advantage.  It will double his pawns up .  With my knight defending a7 too. The situation looks under control.  Another race will start soon. Both of us need back up from our kings.   } Rxc5 44. bxc5 {The exchange took place. Things are looking a little rosier.} Kg7 {My king looks to come to my knights aid. Also releasing my h pawn to advance.  I need his king to have a dilemma, " Which way should I go?"  Help his own pawns or stop mine from surging up the battle field.} 45. Kd3 Kf7 {Both kings hare to the action leaving the black pawns twiddling there thumbs.} 46. Kc4 {white decides on helping hi own pawns.} Ke7 47. Kb5 Kd7 {white can't protect his c7 pawn with his king as b6 and c6 are covered .} 48. a6 Kxc7 49. Kc4 {white withdraws. maybe looking to attack my pawns.} Kc6 {I moved my king up to stop him moving his king in behind my pawns.} 50. Kb4 h5 {H pawn makes it's move with the white king now out of reach.} 51. Kc4 h4 {Twanky resigns knowing he cant catch the scampering pawn. An enjoyable game.}
