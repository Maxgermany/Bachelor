1. g3 {Decided to annotate this game just to show what I'm thinking as I play. I'm an average player and know little about classic opening strategies and I'm often baffled reading 2000+ rated player annotated games.   g3 opening as plan to fianchetto my Bishop as it's sometimes missed by opponents and can sometimes win the a8 Rook if they're careless.} d5 2. Bg2 {Continuation of my planned opening} c6 {Not sure what my opponent is planning here yet} 3. d4 {d4 stop further pawn advance by him and to allow my bishop out} h6 {guarding g5 from my bishop?} 4. Bf4 {Planning on Bxb8 to deny him castling long} Nd7 {foiled!} 5. Nc3 {Just developing another piece} e6 {Looking at pinning my knight i presume} 6. Nf3 {Preparing to castle kingside} Bb4 {Pinning my Knight as expected} 7. Qd2 {In case he plays Bxc3 as I don't want to mess up my pawn structure when taking his Bishop} Qa5 {Doubling up his attack} 8. a3 {To force his Bishop to move or to trade once I have castled.} Ngf6 {Eyeing e4 to add pressure to my c3 Knight I think} 9. O-O {Done for Kings safety and and so I can take his b4 bishop now.} O-O 10. axb4 {As planned} Qxb4 {b2 needs defending here} 11. Ra2 {a2 as want to stay on open file} a6 12. b3 {To cover a4 for Rook attack on Queen} Qe7 {I guess he spotted it!} 13. h3 {keeping his Knight off g4} b5 14. Ne5 {Hoping for a Knight trade here as my retake with dxe5 will threaten his f6 Knight} Nxe5 15. dxe5 Nd7 16. e4 {hoping for pawn trade here} Bb7 17. b4 {making room for Rook on 3rd rank as planning to get across to f file with it.   This was a mistake I missed at the time I played it as it is an undefended piece.} Rfc8 18. Ra3 {As planned} Qxb4 {I missed that move as concentrating on my idea too much!} 19. Rb3 {Threatening queen} Qe7 20. Ne2 {Making room for castle to cross board} Nc5 {Attacking Rook} 21. Rb4 {Rf3 would have been better here but I rushed the move.} a5 22. Rd4 {Only safe place without losing my chance to cross the board} a4 23. exd5 {Making room for Rook to move again. Plan here was to sacrifice Bishop with Bxh6 and hope for gxh6 to expose his King for Rg4+} cxd5 24. Bxh6 {A sacrifice to hopefully expose his King} g6 {Didn't fall for it!} 25. Bg5 {Plan now is to get Bishop to f6 to restrict Kings options} Qd7 26. Bf6 {As planned} Kh7 {Kf8 would not have worked any better for him here as Qh6+ would have been my next move. Now Rh4+ has same result though.} 27. Rh4+ {Got him now} Kg8 28. Rh8# {One of my better games where I actually had a plan that came to fruition!  Two mistakes and one blunder according to the computer so a decent game for me. }
