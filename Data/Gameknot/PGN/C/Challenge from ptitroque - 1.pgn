1. e4 d6 {Pirc opening} 2. Nf3 Nf6 {White opts for a quiet line.} 3. Nc3 g6 4. Bc4 Bg7 5. O-O O-O {Very classical line : players do not take risks.} 6. d3 a6 {The common counterattack in the Pirc is b5} 7. a4 {Preventing b5} c5 {As b5 is not possible anylonger, black must advance something else and cover b4} 8. Re1 {Solid} Nc6 {To protect e5, take control on b4 and contest the center} 9. h3 e6 {Black will attack the center} 10. Bg5 h6 {Weakening the king but forcing white to withdraw.} 11. Bh4 Qc7 {Queen on a good diagonal.} 12. Qd2 {... A good diagonal as well. Both rooks are joined. White is fully developped. Black has still a problem with the LSB} Nh7 {?! } 13. Bg3 {Bishop in front of the queen.} b6 {Black is looking for to block the queenside.} 14. Bf4 {It menaces h6 but is probably a mistake.} g5 {weakening the king but preparing a pawn storm.} 15. Bg3 Nd4 {Black's problem is the LSB : it has no proper place to go. I find it common in the Pirc opening (or at least, it commonly happens to me...). This trading move will enable the LSB to have an active spot on b7 and will weakens black's kingside where black plans the attack.} 16. Nxd4 Bxd4 17. Rab1 {White reincorces the queenside} Bg7 {The DSB has to retreat as white will probably play 18. Ne2} 18. h4 Bb7 {rooks joined. Developpement completed.} 19. Ne2 {The knight covers the important f4 square} Qd7 {To go off the fireline of the DSB } 20. Bb3 {To enable c4} d5 {Black initiates the fight.} 21. exd5 Bxd5 {Black's plan is to trade the LSB (as the DSB is fianchetoed)} 22. Bxd5 Qxd5 23. Nc3 {to fire the queen} Qf5 {?! It seems unsafe for the queen which might get trapped but it gives good attacking possibilities and I estimated that the queen had fine places to go.} 24. Re3 {Menacing 25. Rf3} Ra7 {covering f7} 25. Rf3 {Seems natural at first sight but 25. Rbe1, more strategical, would have been better.} Qg6 {Everybody around their king !} 26. Ne4 {Blunder ! Black's counterattack will be crushing.} f5 {The pawnstorm had been an eventuallity for a long time (excpecially since 23. ... Qf5) but here is the opportunity.} 27. Nd6 {27. Nc3 was another option, may be not better.} e5 {I refrained 27... f4 but white has to save her knight.} 28. Nc4 f4 {The white rook is doomed...} 29. hxg5 Nxg5 {... and the bishop as well for if the bishop moves,31. ... Nxf3+ with menace on the queen.} 30. Qe2 Nxf3+ 31. Qxf3 fxg3 {}
