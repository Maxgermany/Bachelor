1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. e3 Bg7 4. Bd3 {Not much of a future for the bishop here, but the move is playable. I prefer 3. c4.} O-O 5. O-O d6 6. b3 {This might make sense if he intends to fianchetto the bishop. As it is, it just weakens the long dark diagonal.} c5 {Challenging the pawn that blocks that a1-h8 diagonal.} 7. c3 {This reverse-Slav idea would be stronger if the b-pawn was still at b2. Now there's no good square for the QB.} Nc6 {Piling on the pressure at d4.} 8. Bd2 {He should still fianchetto the QB. It's no use at d2.} Bg4 {More indirect pressure on d4.} 9. c4 {? This loses a pawn immediately and a rook eventually. Better was 9. h3, forcing black to retreat or exchange at f3. White's position would be highly playable after 9. Be2 as well.} cxd4 10. exd4 Nxd4 11. Re1 {Alternatives? Maybe 11. Be2, Nxe2+, 12. Qxe2, Nd7, 13. Bc3, Bxc3, 14. Nxc3, Ne5, 15. Qe4, Bxf3, 16. gxf3, Qd7. Black threatens ...Qh3 and ...Nxf3+, etc.} Nxf3+ 12. gxf3 Be6 {Black is a pawn up and white's K-side is destroyed. Oh, and the QR is seriously in danger. In view of all this, 13. Nc3 was necessary, albeit inadequate.} 13. Be4 {The rest is too painful to watch.} Nxe4 14. fxe4 Bxa1 15. Na3 Bg7 {}
