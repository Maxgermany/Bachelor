1. d4 {This game was originally intended to be a fun random inter-team game that doesn't matter.  So I just played any random move I saw without much thought.  And as it turns out, it's probably the greatest game I've ever played.  There's nothing to be proud of by winning over a lower rated opponent, but what makes this game amazing is the moves that were played.   According to computer analysis, my opponent played a "perfect" game, and I was the only one to make a "mistake".  And yet I still won.            I know using computer engine analysis afterward to help analyze this game is kind of cheap, but if you were to seriously look at the position after 17. Nxg5, and try to analyze it yourself (and figure out the forced win), the position is so complex your mind will blow.  Personally I spent at least 6 hours just playing the game from move 21 to the end, and afterward I spent 2-3 hours analyzing it before I gave up amid the complexities and used a computer engine.  And what I found was shocking.  I played the computer from move 17 onwards and eventually (with take-backs) won several times, and after every variation, it would take the computer a long time before it figured out that it was black was in fact losing. Eventually, the computer was still refusing to say that 17. Nxg5 was winning for white, and at best said it was a draw.  I seriously hope it wins, but may still be a draw, and such complexity is beyond my comprehension.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e3 e5 4. Bxc4 exd4 5. exd4 Bb4+ 6. Nc3 {Already starting to look interesting. Save your time for the later developments instead of this lame position.} Nf6 7. Nf3 O-O 8. O-O Nbd7 {!? I would have preferred Nc6, allowing freedom for the bishop. But I think black intends Nb6.} 9. Qb3 Bd6 10. Bg5 Nb6 11. Ne5 {!? At this point I just wanted to throw everything at black's king and see what happens. I didn't want to spend much time thinking because I didn't care whether I won or lost.  That would change very soon.} Nxc4 12. Qxc4 Be6 13. d5 {! I don't know what got into me this game but I made this move with minimal thought. As it turns out it deserves an exclamation mark for the pressure it puts on black, and is eventually a very important pawn in allowing 17. Nxg5 to win.  If Bxe5 then 14. dxe6, generating pressure on black's king.  (14. ... fxe6 Qxe6+ wins a bishop) } Bf5 14. Rae1 {!?  More surprises.  My entire goal was to point everything at black's king, and think of nothing else. In fact I made this move essentially without thinking as well.} h6 15. Bh4 a6 {In hindsight, g5 was better because my bishop has to move.   This move wasn't bad at all in the circumstances however, because it takes the b5 square out of my control.} 16. Nf3 {!? Funny, I intended to retreat with this move and allow black to create his own attack. Of course the side effect was the opening of the e file.  That was because after a few minutes' thinking I couldn't come up with anything better. (I thought about f4 but I didn't believe it would do anything useful. I like to keep my king hidden.) Instead this is what happened:} g5 17. Nxg5 {!! Like I said I didn't care about the outcome of the game.  My trial version 2800 elo Shredder engine said this was a mistake! And I punished its incorrect judgement by beating it.  I highly doubt any computer, whether it's Rybka or Fritz, would ever play this, because it clearly looks as though white hasn't much to attack/threaten with and black has a solid defense.} hxg5 18. Bxg5 Kg7 {Forced.  Otherwise Qh4! wins the game.} 19. Ne4 {! Another computer-defying move.  Somehow it just came naturally to me.  This forces a passive knight to be traded by one of black's important defenders.} Bxe4 {Now black could also have played Be7.  White still wins if 19. ... Be7 by 20. Qd4!! Kg6 21. Ng3 Kxg5 **(if Qxd5 4. Bxf6 Qxd4 5. Bxd4 Bd6 6. Nxf5 Kxf5 and white is up a pawn with black's king stranded in the centre)** 22. Re5! Kg6 23. Qf4! (lots of checkmate threats) Ng7 24. Nxf5 Bg5 25. Qg4 and I think black looks pretty screwed with a looming f4 threat. } 20. Rxe4 Rh8 {The only other move was Re8, but it is uncertain whether that move avoids a loss (too complicated to analyze conclusively, even for my computer!).   Possible variations after Re8 after hours of analysis: Draw: 21. Rxe8 Qxe8 22. Bxf6 Kxf6 23. Qh4+  Draw by perpetual check. Similar to the Rh8 variation: 21. Re1 Rxe4 22. Rxe4 Be7 23. Qd4 Qd6  and my computer posts a draw by repetition. (24. Rg4 Kf8 25. Rg3 Rd8 26. Qh4 Ke8 27. Qh8+ Kd7 and draw) Not sure if there's a move the computer missed that wins, as in the case of the Rh8 move, the winning moves which I found by myself (my computer couldn't find it even after hours of searching). But a possible continuation without drawing: 24. Rf4 Rh8 25. h4! Re8 26. Too many possibilities and complications to analyze. But if 24. Rf4 c6! I think black might survive and draw. (but not conclusively sure) Heres one: 24. Re5 and I haven't quite had enough time to analyze this, neither has the computer (the computer still says black is slightly better); I found a draw through this that I forgot the sequence but I'm not sure if it's possible to win through this.    If anyone can conclusively prove a draw or a win for white, please add your input!  This is the best I can do. } 21. h4 {! At this point I immediately saw the possibility of an h-pawn advance, threatening black's king all the time.} Re8 22. Rfe1 {! Forcing a rook trade and then I have an active rook while his is hidden behind his queen.} Rxe4 23. Rxe4 Be7 {This move must be done to eliminate the deadly pin on the knight.} 24. Qc3 {! This creates many threats, and keeps the knight pinned.  I chose Qc3! over Qd4 because it gives my queen more flexibility, with the whole row 3 available and in addition guards the e1 square which will will be black's only threat later on.} Qd6 {This move also must be played because black really needs the rook to survive.  } 25. Rf4 {! White's threats never stop.  This prevents any of black's pieces from moving, except the black rook.  } Re8 {Rh8 is possible but really doesn't anything because after 26. Rf5 white's h-pawn can still advance.  Black could have played c6! and it might draw, but not sure.} 26. h5 {! Now white starts to cash things in.} Bd8 {This must be played because of the threat of the Rf5-Bf4-Rg5 trio. Rh8 again does nothing because after Rf5! the pawn cannot be stopped. } 27. Rf5 {!! This amazing beauty does the following: 1. Protects pawn and bishop (obvious) 2. I had envisioned the devastation if the rook and bishop swapped places, and all the massive amounts of checkmate threats and sacrificial traps. This move allows that swapping. 3.  Does not let up any pressure on black and still keeps 3 of white's 4 pieces immobile. 4. Prevents Re5, which is the most effective way for black to halt white's attack in its tracks.   5. Cannot be attacked by any of black's pieces or king.} c5 {? c6 was better.  This was definitely an oversight.  But still at this point black is lost.   Black's best move would have been Re4!, and I would have responded g3!, and eventually h6 would still be possible. I'll update with actual lines later.} 28. h6+ {! Brings home the golds and diamonds it has worked so hard for.} Kg6 {Forced move.} 29. Bf4 {Black's queen has 4 options, one of them leads to checkmate (or loss of massive material) (Qf8) and the rest aren't much better.} Qb6 {Black chooses the lesser of the 3 other poisons.  } 30. Rg5+ Kh7 31. Rg7+ Kh8 32. Rxf7 {There is equal material now but white holds a humonguous positional advantage.  White can win the knight by: 32. ... Qb4 33. Be5 Qxc3 34. Bxc3 and that knight is poof, gone!     A classic win!  }
