[Opening "Dutch defence, Blackburne variation (A81)"]

1. d4 {In this, the third of our 'coaching' games, I relayed my thought processes - in fairly general terms - in the chat column.  It is a pity I didn't preserve them in some way.  Neither side played very accurately - but I think there is plenty of interest here.} f5 {Dutch Defence.  Whenever I play this I have the Stonewall in mind.  Very occasionally, though, I follow with the Leningrad Dutch instead.} 2. g3 {Theory holds this as one of White's best - certainly a very popular - responses to the Dutch Defence.  For all its solid, defensive appellation and appearance, the Stonewall is in fact quite an aggressive line, as is the Dutch overall.  That f-pawn move rather says to White: 'I going toe to toe with you, so watch it!'  White builds as strong a defence as she can on the K-side.} Nf6 {Normally I play 2...e6, but this knight development is equally good.  It is just transposing moves.} 3. Bg2 {The space having been cleared for the bishop, the bishop occupies it at once.} d5 {Definitely aiming for the Stonewall formation of pawns at f5, d5 and e6, c6.  It is a very solid and strong centre formation.  There are several of downsides, though. One is that the dark squares, especially e5, can be infiltrated by White.  Another is that Black's light-square bishop can become something of a problem child - what to do with it?  Yet the line was good enough for GM M. Botvinnik to adopt it in World Championship match games.  Indeed both players tried it at least once each the Botvinnik-Bronstein match of 1951.} 4. Nf3 e6 5. O-O Bd6 {Interrupting the programme in favour of development.  The move 5...c6 would have been thematic and fine, but the move played is still 'book'.  Incidentally, when playing the Stonewall, I much prefer, if I can, to develop the bishop at d6 rather than e7.} 6. c3 {Rather conservative, I thought.  The move is solid enough, and quite safe, but the drawback (it seems to me) is that subsequently White will have trouble formulating a plan.  I was expecting 6.c4, here, to which I was planning to reply 6...c6.  This would have opened a nice retreat square for the bishop after a possible 7.c5!?} O-O {At this point the Gameknot Engine (GKE) assesses the game at B0.21 (The B infront of the number indicates a Black edge).  But any margin less than W/B0.50 is really too close to call and denotes an equal game.} 7. Nbd2 {Had White played c4 the previous miove, this knight could have been developed at c3.  Would that have been a more active location?  Possibly not.  By this move, White opens up the possibility of moving the f3-knight to e5, and following with the other knight to f3.  That is quite a thematic motif in play against the Stonewall, but it is no simple matter to arrange.  Black might, for example, choose to exchange on e5 with a knight at d7, or even the d6-bishop.} Bd7 {Blocks the knight, which may not have been the smartest option.  I was planning to bring the bishop back to e8 after which it might find useful employment at h5 or g6.  The GKE now calls the game so nearly equal it makes no difference: W0.03.} 8. Ne1 {This retreat might look unnecessary and timid, but it harbours (or ought to do) some nasty intent.  I really did expect that White intended to follow with 9.f4.  That had a big influence on my reply.} g5 {[!?] GKE calls this an inaccuracy, offering the following line: 8… g5 9. Ndf3 h6 10. Ne5 Nc6 11. Nxd7 Qxd7 12. Nd3 ...  But as its assessment is just W0.27 (from B0.30 the previous move) there really isn't a lot in it.  I accepted the line was probably too aggressive too early, but I was prepared to take the risk.  As it happens White probably had a better move than 9.f4 in mind, but rather to bring the knights to d3 and f3, training them against e5.  That would have been a very good plan and well executed too: 8...Nc6 9. Nd3 Qe8 10. Nf3 Ne4 11. Be3 Qh5 12. Nc5 Bxc5 13. dxc5 g5 14. Qc2 f4 15. gxf4 gxf4 (GKE).  But this line looks fine for Black, in my view.} 9. c4 {Possibly better would have been 9.Ndf3 as suggested by the GKE, and let this pawn push wait upon activating the White pieces.} c6 {Black was not interested in exchanging pawns on c4, which would have been very pleasing for White.  Instead I invite 10.c5 Bc7.  White doesn't bite. All the same the GKE mislikes this, and suggests White would have done well to follow up with 10.c5: ...Bc7 11. Nd3 g4 12. Nb3 Na6 13. Bh6 Re8 14. Ne5 Bxe5 15. dxe5 Ne4 16. Qd4 b6 17. cxb6 axb6.  It prefers ...Nc6, but if then 10.c5!?, Be7 leaves the bishop on a less active diagonal.  Having said all that, neither line led to a definable edge to either side, the assessment still being well within the W/B0.50 range.} 10. Nc2 {This bespeaks possibly too defensive an attitude of mind.  Much better was 10.Nd3, prodding that tender point, e5.  True, Black would have repsonded with 10...g4, stopping the other knight reaching f3, but then White could have begun preparations for Queen side operations.  GKE offers this: 10. Nd3 g4 11. c5 Bc7 12. Nb3 Na6 13. Bh6 Re8 14. Ne5 Ne4 15. Nxd7 Qxd7 16. f3 gxf3 17. exf3, which looks pretty good for White.} h5 {Really announcing my intention to attack all out on the King side.  This is actually fairly risky, as Black can point to no real advantage to justify this.  Nor is the centre fully closed.  I am rather trusting that the centre is sufficiently locked up that it won't explode under some counter action by White in that part of the board.  The alternative 10...Na6 never crossed my mind at all, and I doubt I would have played it if it had.  I think I might have chosen 10...Be8 instead.} 11. cxd5 exd5 {For the first time, the GKE gives the advantage .... to White!  I admit that in normal circumstances I would have chosen to recapture with the c-pawn, with an even game.  But I wanted to keep the g2-bishop's long diagonal closed up as much as possible, and open up the c8-h3 diagonal for my own light-square bishop (LSB, c.f. DSB).  The main risk lies in the slight loosening of the centre, which can only favour White.} 12. Nf3 {By attacking the g5-pawn in this way, White maintains a slight edge.} Ne4 {Possibly safer would have been 12...Nh7, but I wasn't interested in 'playing safe'.   But it was not going to be easy maintaining the knight at this outpost.  The Queen's knight is far too distant.} 13. Ne5 {Thematic and good.  I had a long think at this point - even considered exchanging on e5.  The knight exerts considerable influence on the light squares in Black's position - a real nuisance, withal.  At the same time, White threatens 14.f3, to which I figured I'd have to reply 14...Nc5 and if 15.dxc5, Bxe5.  } Be8 {Played after much thought.  It was probably just as well to make way for the Queen's knight, and to entrench the e8-h5 diagonal as well. Instead, 13...Qf6 would probably have been as good an option.  At this point the GKE assessed the position as W1.27 - Advantage, White.} 14. Be3 {[?] This move wipes out all that advantage, according to the GKE, and I'm inclined to agree.  I can see why White would have seen the development of this bishop as a matter of urgency, but, having waited this long, and with nowhere really useful to go, it should have waited further.  For example, 14.f3! Nc5  15.f4! gxf4 16.Bxf4 Ne6  17.Qd2 would have left White with a great position, and Black with problems to solve.  It would have been hard to see any way to revivify the morobund K-side attack.} f4 {The obvious response, as Black's attack gathers momentum.} 15. gxf4 {[?!]  For the first time, the advantage swings in favour of Black (GKE B0.60).  Instead 15.f3!? Nxg3!? 16.hxg3 fxe3 19.Qd3 ... left a very murky position much harder to call.} gxf4 {Driving back the bishop, and opening up the g-file.  The big concern I have is that Black's King is far more exposed to the elements than is White's.  If White ever manages to wrest back the initiative, my King might find himself lacking shelter from the storm.  } 16. Bc1 {A rather dismal retreat.  I probably would not have exchanged it for my knight had it gone to d2, rather leaving it to shut in the White Queen.  What is keeping White in the game is that stout knight in e5.} Nd7 {Completing development and threatening to win a pawn by exchanging on e5.} 17. Qd3 {[?!] One feels that something like 17.Nf3 would have kept the pawn.  But Black would have had a free hand to build up an attack.} Bxe5 {Oddly enough, not an easy decision.  Exchanging knights would have kept the DSB, but White would simply have blocked the f-pawn (f2-f3) to close off its action towards h2.  I figured a knight on e5 would have more scope than the bishop.} 18. dxe5 Nxe5 19. Qd1 {I really expected something like Qh3, here, not so much because it would have been objectively better, but it would have been a more active placing.  Black's edge is becoming more pronounced (GKE B1.70).  That White is confined to just two ranks makes a dark impression.  One should note, here, that although White has the 'bishop pair', that motif is pretty much irrelevant in this game.} Qh4 {Threatening, among other things, ...Ng4 and/or ...f3. } 20. Qe1 {[?] Up until now, despite impressions, White was still in the fight.  In view of the threatened ,,,f3 and ...Ng4, 20.f3! would have cut across both and forced Black to recast his plans.  One possibility was 20.f3 Ng3!  21.Qe1! ... Not 21.hxg3? fxg3  22.Rf2  h4 with a strong attack for Black. You can see, though, that White was conscious of the pressure on f2.  Not playable was 20.Bxe4 ... on account of 20...Ng4! 21.Bxd5ch Bf7 22.Kg2 f3ch 23.Kxf3 ...(the alternatives are equally dire) ...Bxd5#.} f3 {[!] There was no passing up this opportunity.  Black now has a near-on winning game.} 21. exf3 Rxf3 {[??] Oops.  The irony is that I thought first of 21...Nxf3ch  22.Bxf3 Rxf3, and came this close -><- to playing it.  But it was hard to see any decisive follow-up.  So, as one does, I bethought me of reversing the move order, which seemed to offer so much more.  I've known it reap dividends.  Not this time...} 22. Ne3 {[?] That was a piece of luck for me, and Black 'regains' the winning edge.  Instead, 22.Nd4! - a move I completely overlooked - would have wiped out almost all the advantage I had: 22. Nd4 Rf7 23. f3 Qxe1 24. Rxe1 Nd3 25. Re2 Nxc1 26. Rxc1 Nd6 27. Bh3 Rg7+ 28. Kf2 Bg6 29. Ne6 Re7 30. Rg1.  } Bd7 {Here come the reinforcements.  White can not, of course, take the rook.} 23. Bd2 Raf8 {[?!]  The GKE pilloried this move, though it still retains a winning edge.  I did consider 23.d4, but I figured on  stacking further pressure upon the besieged f2-square.} 24. Bb4 {Attacking the rearward rook.  Possibly 24.Bc3 was the better option, trying to eliminate some of the nearest attackers.  As it happened the text move opened up an interesting, spectacular idea...} Rf3xf2 {In its assessment of White's previous move, the GKE suggested 24...c5.  I much preferred the direct approach.  Partly this was in the hope of this spectacular line: 25.Bxf8 Qxh2ch!  26.Kxh2 Nf3ch 27.Kh1 Ng3#.} 25. Rxf2 {The obvious response.  Even though 25.Bd6 may be objectively better - stopping the Queen sacrifice at h2, for one thing - the difference between assessments of minus 8 and minus 11 is neither here nor there: both represent games too far gone to be salvageable.} Rxf2 {Now Black's last reserves have joined the attack.} 26. Qd1 {Better - and the move I expected - was 26.Bd6.  But, annoyingly enough, the text move also prevents the Q sacrifice at h2, because f3 is now adequately protected against it.} Nf3+ {[!?] Instead, ...Bg4.} 27. Bxf3 {An oversight that terminates the game at once.  But White was scarcely going to contemplate Qxf3, the only way to prevent an immediate mate, was she?  E.g. 27.Qxf3 Rxf3  28.Bxf3 Qf2ch 29.Kh1 Qxf3ch  30.Ng2 Bh3  31.Rg1 Nf2#.} Qxh2# {}
