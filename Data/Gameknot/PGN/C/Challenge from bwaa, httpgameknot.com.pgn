Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. f4 {The once feared 4 pawns attack is very agressive and cut throat. white wishes to play e4-e5 which results in very complicated positions.  } Bg7 8. Bb5+ {This check is very unpleasent for black. White wins a tempo and increases the efficantancy of e4-e5.  } Nfd7 {the best reply even though d7 is not the best square for the knight. It does stopt e4-e5 and in view of ...a6 followed by ...b5 white is forced to spend a tempo retreating the LSB  Alternative variation: 8...
