1. e4 e5 2. h3 {Morphy "wastes" a move, waiting for his opponent to commit.} d5 3. exd5 {Black plays a colors-reversed Center Game...} Bc5 {...and instead of recapturing, elects to play a gambit.} 4. Bc4 c6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. d3 {Opening a line for the QB.} a5 7. Bg5 Nbd7 {Reinforcing the guard of the pinned Knight.} 8. dxc6 bxc6 {Black's Q-side Pawn structure is in tatters.} 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O h6 {Morphy has a slight lead in development in addition to the Pawn plus.} 11. Bh4 Qc7 {Unpinning.} 12. d4 exd4 13. Nxd4 {Morphy opens up the game, trying to strike quickly before Black can finish his development and consolidate his defense.} Bd6 14. Nf5 Bh2+ {Black is unafraid, but his counterplay leads nowhere. A one-piece thrust isn't a strong enpough pushback, as Morphy shows.} 15. Kh1 Ne5 16. Bb3 Ba6 {Black tries to organize his forces for a counterblow. However, Morphy's more aggresive pieces get there first.} 17. Re1 Ng6 18. Bxf6 {Removing a valuable defender.} gxf6 19. Qh5 {Black resigns, as there is no way to prevent 20 QxN ch winning a piece. [19... K-R1, 19... K-R2 or 19... K-N2 are answered by 20 QxP ch K-N1 21 Q-N7 mate!] If the Knight moves, 20 NxP ch is decisive.}
