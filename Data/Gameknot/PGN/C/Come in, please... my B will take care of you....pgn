1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 c6 3. c3 h6 4. h3 e6 5. Nf3 Bd6 6. Ne5 {This move is best when e3 has been played, so to get the Q to the check in h5 if black plays f6. If black does so, the N can jump to f7 for a kamikaze sac, or retreat (more likely) in d3, so after BxB, NxB, black can grab the initiative with Qg5, putting white in a little trouble. } Nf6 7. e3 {Released. Nf6 prevents f6, and if ever this N moves, my Q is free to reach the white squares. } O-O {As black, I should have preferred to continue developement. Black has serious difficulties to push back the white Ne5. Ne7 doesn't help, since black can't exchange NxN or dxe5, forking N and B. The only other option is BxN (leaving white in control of the dark squares), to which white will answer dxe5, "blinding" his own B, but cramping black's developement. } 8. g4 {White doesn't play for kingside castling, that's obvious, now. The most frightening (and, probably, strong) moves are just pawn's moves. The lsb will come out ONLY if a concrete threat is made, not before (timing is crucial). White would like a tempo to play Nd2, but more important (in this case) is to attack black's kinside before he can unravel his pieces. } Bxe5 {Good... because black gives up the c5 counterattack. Probably it will be a little slow, because white can't just ignore it: 8. c5 (ok, a tempo was lost before, playing c6, but...), and white is not forced to do anything. He welcomes c4 by black (since no Bd3 won't have to move a second time), and cxd4 (white can even try Qxd4!?).} 9. dxe5 {This is kind of strange, since I am blinding my own B. BUT consider that if the B lands in e5, it will easily kicked or exchanged by Nd7... helping black in his developement! This way, black is still cramped. } Nh7 {Very good choice. The other one, Ne4, is also possible. White would play kicking the N after f3, Ng5, h4, if not for Qh4+!, but white can simply play Nd2 and eventually safely exchanging it. Anyway, if Black goes 9... Ne4, white will answer h4!, preventing the BQ's burst on the black squares. So, this was a wise move by black. Nevertheless, his position is already very weak!} 10. h4 {! Any move that allows pawn's exchanges is good for white. Observe how "undeveloped" white is, but how powerful his threats. Both bishops and a R, and the Q, in some way, are participating in the attack. The lsb will come in when/if needed, I don't even have to castle.} f5 {"Nerve collapse", but... what else? Qe8 was better, but it is hard to see. Black will need coverage on the white squares (like h4) soon. } 11. g5 {Not gxf5, because it allowed the black R to get into life. Even exf4 could be considered, to give options to his lsb. But this move is good ONLY because black cannot play h5, because of Qxh5. } hxg5 {The dearest pawn in e5 allows all this. Black can't play Nf6 or Rf6. } 12. hxg5 {I know that I'll lose a pawn. It doesn't matter! I want my columns opened in front of his king. Some soldier must die for it... :-)} Qe8 {! Very good! Black smells the danger and acts with the best one! He can't allow my Q to get to h4. After the Q's exchange black will be released of some of the inmediate danger. } 13. Qf3 {Fooling him, thinking in Qh3. } Qg6 {! Black has detected, again, my threat, and correctly, defends. Now, I would have preferred for him g6 instead, since black's duty is to put a barrier to white. g6 doesn't leave much of a hole in h6 because Wdsb is blocked, and through the 7th rank now black will be able to get some action with Rf7 (defending the N, which can't move or Qh8#).} 14. Qh3 {? This was a mistake, in a way, since I am sacrifying g5... and my R can't go to g1. White could have played Qg3. I choose this one instead, with the idea that "opening columns will be in my favour, anyway". So I was inviting him to "come on, please..." :-). I'll allow him to move, but I hold a pressure that will allow my lsb to get to h5... and curtains for black, if he doesn't come up with something (which he did). } Nxg5 15. Qg3 {Not Qh8+, Kf7, and I can only retire the Q. Now I am pinning his N, and black has lost a piece! In a position like this, tricks show at every corner. } Nd7 16. Bxg5 {A piece is gone. Black can win the beloved e5, though, if Nxe5, QxN, QxB. } f4 {Black counterattacks! His move is good not because he sacs a pawn, but because he opens the way for his Q to c2! He correctly spotted the downside of leaving the lsb into his home key, and found the way to exploit it. } 17. exf4 {"Come in, please!". My attack is too strong on the kingside, I won't give it up. Come in, and my beloved Bf1 will be my savior, my faithful guard. He can't guard b2, it's true, but who cares of this far and unactive R when we are two moves from victory on the kingside?} Qc2 {Of course, Qc1+ must be prevented, or the R will be taken with checks, and more checks will come soon after...} 18. Be2 {! But all is avoided with this "innocent" move! If Qc1+, Bd1, and white has no more check! Yes, he can lose two tempoes to grab the Ra1, but... he will be mated in the meantime!} Qxb2 {?? Black should have used this tempo to help himself with the K's defence. Qe5 - threatening the R and pinning the B will be fine. Rf7 was impossible: Qh3 and the mate is unstoppable (I think). } 19. Bh6 {Black can play Rf7. If white goes Bh5, Qc1+! and white is forced to take back the B to d1 (or mate!). } Rf7 20. Rh4 {White can't save the R, and then the N - this time with check. This won't be deadly, but white must try to avoid it - who knows... This move just aims to put another attacker on the g column, one not as powerful as the Q, so that it can be thrown to g7. } Nf8 {? Black adds a protection to g6, but it's too late! The other option was better: QxR, presumabily white would have gone on with Rg4, and then, QxN+... just to be able to go back to h7 to help in the defence!} 21. Rg4 g6 {The planned defence, but now useless. } 22. Rxg6+ Nxg6 23. Qxg6+ {White will lose a R all the same, but white will do it in a winning mate net. } Kh8 24. Qxf7 {g7 is out of black's reach, no matter what he does. Maybe balck could have survived, and he did not bad at all during most of the game. But he was facing the deadly (:-) London attack. } Qc1+ 25. Bd1 {My faithful guard! My savior! How important was this little piece, how well chosen were his only two, hiper-passive movements! Black resigns... with his honour saved! Well done, black, even if you lost. }
