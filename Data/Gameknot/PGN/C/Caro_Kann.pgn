1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {It's experimental game and I appreciate that my opponent chooses this line, which is common but I do not know it.} c5 {I found this idea in the DB and it seems to be a funny line to follow.} 4. dxc5 {Now, black is one pawn late.} Nc6 5. Nf3 {The other option for white is 5. Bb5} Bg4 {5. ... Qa5+ was also playable but white can play 6.Nc3 which gives the knight a good place and doesn't lose a tempo. Then, the black queen can easily be fired by 6. b4. 5. ... e6 is playable as well but I thought that my LSB would be blocked and I didn't like this idea. } 6. Bb5 {pinning the knight.} e6 {Now I can play e6 without blocking my LSB. My plan is to set the g knight on e7 and to fiancheto y DSB, so that black would have a very good defense and counterattacking possibilities toward e5.} 7. b4 {The c pawn is here to stay  but my plan is to develop and menace the e pawn with my fianchetoed DSB. Since white will probably castle short, the e pawn will be hard to defend, except by playing f4, which will weaken the white queen.} g6 {To prepare Bg7.  With the g knight on e7, black should have a good defense.} 8. Nbd2 Nge7 {Carrying on the plan} 9. h3 {It doesn't change black's plan} Bxf3 10. Nxf3 Bg7 {Only 2 more moves and black's developpement will be completed. (O-O and Qc7). I think that the position shall be really good.} 11. Bg5 {White seems to share this opinion and prevents my fine developpement. If we trade black's 2 bishops against white's 2 knights, which I cannot prevent, black's counterattacking possibiities will be considerably weakened but white will find it difficult to attack my fiancheto without DSB, so that I might obtain a draw even considering white's pawn advance.} Qc7 12. Bxe7 Qxe7 {No choice} 13. O-O {Puting the King in safety and preparing Re1} O-O {Menacing Nxe5} 14. Bxc6 bxc6 {So, it's done. Black is better on the center but black can contest it. White is ahead in material (one pawn), both Kings are safe, there is no immediate threat and no open line. Black's pawn structure is better. White can improve his but he will have to weaken his king. White has still the initiative. With this pawn disposition, a bishop is better than a knight. The situation seems equilibrated.} 15. c3 {Porbably to protect b4 and, more important, to reinforce d4 which might become an essential square, later in the game, the drawback being having an unprotected c pawn on black's DSB diagonal where the black queen could soon come. Anyway, black cannot prevent f6. Now I see 2 possible plans for black : whether defend on the left wing (playing Rfb8 or a6), or attack on the center, attacking the e pawn by f6 or with a previous Qc7. I hesitate a bit. Anyway, this game is already a good point for me, because it's the first time that I can envisage an attacking strategy with black, against a master, with a reasonable chance of success.} Qc7 {Finally, I opt for this move : the queen protects the a7 and c6 pawn, two of the weak points of black's dispositive and menaces e5, one of the weak points of black's one.} 16. Qe2 Rfb8 {It seemed evident that I had to set a rook on b8 but which one ? I choosed the f one because I supposed that my opponent would attack on the queenside but was not sure at all.} 17. a4 {Attack on the queenside... Black weakest point.} a5 {Another long hesitation : 17. ... a6 or 17. ... a5. Finally I elected 17. ... a5 because I can answer axb5 if white plays c4.} 18. Rfb1 Rb7 19. Qe1 {Now white has 3 pieces aiming at b4 and if 20. c4, 3 pieces aiming at a5. On the other hand one piece left aiming at b5 (positive thinking...)} Rab8 {Anyway, it's too late to change black's defense. Hopefully it holds. If so, some counterplay will be available withe the DSB and the double rooks.} 20. Nd4 {I had anticipated this but in my analyses the white lady was on e3. Anyway the possibilities are so numerous that I am almost sure not to have studied them all (I have very little hope that it's the same for my opponent).} Bxe5 {I didn't see any othe move. At least white has one pawn less and black dominates the center (positive thinking) so that strong counterplay will be possible. But will the queenside hold ? Verdun's battle is about to begin and it will be bloody.} 21. Nxc6 {The assault begins !} Bxc3 {winning a pawn.} 22. Qxc3 Qxc6 {The first assaulting wave is over. Black has won material but the lost of the c6 pawn seriously weakens the defense.} 23. b5 {Second wave.} Qc7 {Black draws back but the line is not broken.} 24. c6 {Only 2 more steps and the game is over for black.} Ra7 {Only move to save the rook and prevent 25. Qxa5, which would mean the end of black's resistance at middle term.} 25. Qf6 {White's progression is blocked. If 25. b6 Rxb6 26. Rxb6 Qxb6 and white c pawn will soon be under attack of both queen and rook. So that white tries a turning move (totally overlooked by black). I'm satisfied because the situation is not worse than at the begining of white's assault : his pawns have moved forward but material is now equal and black is stronger in the center. A draw seems quite a reasonable objective. } Qb6 {Rb6 was another candidate move but I thought that the queen also protected a5 and far more important, that it could control the a7 f1 diagonal, an important one.} 26. Kh1 {White put his king in safety, probably planning to move the f pawn later.} Rc7 {So that black finishes to install his defense. Rook and queen are blocked (although the queen has the diagonal available but the b rook is still able to go and reinforce any weak point or support an eventual attack on the center by d4 or e5 if white lets this opportunity to black. The situation is not great but a draw still seems realisable if black makes no mistake.} 27. g4 {attacking on the kingside but weakening the white king.} Re8 {To prepare the counterattack} 28. Rbc1 {I couldn't find the reason of this move. Probably a long term plan } e5 {Black has to take the initiative. The plan is to settle one or 2 pawns on the center and oblige the white lady to leave. She didn't break anything during the time she was my guest but enough is enough and she's not welcomed any longer} 29. Kg2 {I'm not sure about this move. May be to protect the f pawn if the white queen has to move. May be to advance toward the center, preparing the endgame, maybe to enable the c rook to come on h1 and support a pawn advance on the kingside, maybe to support the pawn advance, maybe a waiting move, letting black advance his central pawns to counterattack, maybe for several of those reasons.} Re6 {Carrying on the plan : the white queen has to leave. Mistake. I overlooked the fork attack By 30. Qd8+. d4 was the correct move.} 30. Qd8+ {Fork attack. Black loses the d pawn.} Kg7 31. Qxd5 {I overlooked this move. Now the game is lost for black for there is very little probablility that black does a mistake.} Rf6 {Menacing 32. ... Qxf2+} 32. Ra2 {preventing black's attack on f2} Re6 {preparing the advance of the e pawn} 33. Kg3 e4 34. Rd2 e3 {advancing the e pawn} 35. Qd4+ Qxd4 {No choice for black} 36. Rxd4 e2 {Only one more step but the black pawn will never manage to do it.} 37. Re1 {Logical} Rce7 38. Rc4 Re6e4 39. Rxe4 Rxe4 {Trading} 40. c7 Rc4 {Only move} 41. b6 {Black resigns here. No way to prevent the b or c pawn to get a promotion. Thank you Master Stalhandske for this game. the Caro Kann is definitely a efficient defense because, untill of the mistake 29. ... Re6, I made a good resistance.}
