[Black "GM Victor Korchnoi "]
[Opening "Pirc (B09), Austrian attack"]

1. e4 {Just like with me, as well as, your average chess player, this was also Fischer's favorite opening.  In fact, this is what he called, "Best by Test", and it also goes by something that elyhim mentioned which I've noted in several of my annotations, "stick with what you know".} d6 {But, just like with me, Fischer also, in my opinion, isn't use to seeing this played as black.  I believe it's the Pirc Defense, but whatever it is, it's unusual which is also why I deem analysis necessary, as much more common is the Scandinavian Defense, in which, 1...d5  In fact, the master mater played this against me, and I lost for the same reason that I lost the game with elyhim, as well as, games that Ken has seen, being that I wasn't used to it.  That shows, as Ken also mentioned, how intense openings can be.} 2. d4 {Yet, not only would I have played, but nothing else would've come into consideration because of what theory states.  That is, when black only advances a pawn one move in their first move, 2.d4 is the way to go.  } Nf6 {Like wise, I also wouldn't have considered any other move as black since this develops.} 3. Nc3 {Fischer is thinking along the same lines since he also develops.  Although, unlike before, this is the only other move that would've come into consideration, I would've played 3.Nf3 to mobilize the K side with the idea of castling short.  But, as per what happened with my game against Loyd on Friday, it can wait, as that was the second time that I thought about Joann's thread on, "When and Where it's safe to castle".  In fact, Fischer doesn't castle until much later on (by this, I mean 5 more moves, as opposed to, in the near future which would be in, at most, 3 moves.)} g6 {But, Korchnoi, however, thinks differently with this fianchetto.  Personally, I would've played 3...e6 with the idea of opening up the center.  But, this is the first move where I would've thought about several moves that develop since we have the Bc8, as well as, the Nb8.  With that being said, this also would've come into consideration.} 4. f4 {But, I wouldn't have even considered this move since that's the weakest pawn on the board.  As a rule of thumb, I leave it alone in the opening because if it gets captured, you wind up in trouble.  Most people do not agree, but I know otherwise because of what TA emphasized in his club with the blitz Q sacs.  In fact, that's how I remembered about what to do in the Domiano Defense, especially when black gets greedy and takes the N, as the f pawn is removed which is how white wins the game.  And, after mentioning it, Joe implied that my assessment is spot on.  In it he said that I see the pattern which is also what he was trying to show by sacking the Queen for a pawn.  That's because it is the f pawn, which is the weakest one on the board.  Once it's gone you must be careful as you're left with that same weakness.} Bg7 {After having had finachettoed, nothing else would've come into consideration since Victor has a nice long diagonal for his Bishop which is something that I also care.  But, this also enables black to castle which is also why I would've played this, as he will castle on his next move.} 5. Nf3 {Meanwhile, Bob has his mind on mobilizing the K side.  But, Victor is one step ahead because, as noted, he is about to castle.} O-O 6. Be2 {Which enables Bob to mobilize his K side even more with this move.  Although this would've come into consideration, I, on the other hand, would've played 6.Bd3 to add a defender to the e4 pawn.} c5 {At first, I was wondering why Victor played this and didn't see the point.  That's because I would've continued developing by bringing the Bc8 into play.  But, this is a solid move.  The idea is to allow ...Nc6 since Victor going to follow the guideline of not advancing the N until the c pawn has advanced.  On the other hand, I would've ignored that guideline since white did not play 1.e4, which means that it would've been inaccurate.  What that shows is something that I noted in TA's game.  While you don't always need to follow since seeing the big picture (the entire story that the board is indicating is more important); it's important to, "Know your principles".  That means understand why a particular one is there, and other times and for certain ones, it matters.  That is the case here.  With that being said, Bob takes.} 7. dxc5 Qa5 {Instead of taking back, Victor plays this.  But, for me, aside from 7...dxc5, nothing else would've come into consideration.  On the other hand, this move makes sense.  I don't see how but understand that whites Nc3 is more then just a nuicanse, where as, I would've just seen it as annoying, and thus, an obstacle as it doesn't appear tp threaten anything.  But, looks can be deceiving, and there's just got to be something that makes white's Nc3 a monster.} 8. O-O {I like castling and can understand why Fischer did this.  But, despite what I was once told, I don't always follow the rule of basing things on what the position demands.  Perhaps, that's where I go wrong, as we saw in my second game with dynamic_dv.  With that being, 8.Bd2 is the only that would've come into consideration.  With that being said, I wouldn't have hesitated or even thought twice about playing that move.  As you would expect, that's because Jack Stockel mentioned that the best way to break a pin like this is with the Bishop, and despite coaching, this is still the only thing that I go by, despite the pin happening on the Nc3, as opposed to, the Nf3 (which is when it generally applies).  But, no matter how you look at it, Victor is going to win the pawn back with his next move.} Qxc5+ 9. Kh1 {Although, 9.Rf2 was also an option, I also would've played this move.  As interposing with the Rook leaves it pinned.  But, even if it weren't so, the primary reason behind playing this is because Jack also mentioned that the monarch is the safest in the corner, after castling.  } Nc6 {Meanwhile, Victor continues with his development.} 10. Nd2 {At first, I didn't understand why Bob played this.  I don't see a better outpost, but there's something about 11.Nb3 that does.  My guess is just the gain of tempo because the Queen is attacked.} a5 {This is just like with one of my past games against easy19, in what he called, "Walking the Plank" since we're talking about the same pawn.  But, the significance is that Victor gets a semi open file as it is directly in front of the Rook which plays an important role.} 11. Nb3 Qb6 12. a4 {And, with it, Bob uses that time to stop black's open file.  For if he didn't, Victor might threatened to get a passed pawn even sooner.} Nb4 {And, Victor goes on a rampage with his N.  Although we don't see it now, this does pose as a threat, as I learned with TA's Knight visualization as it becomes evident when this moves back and forth.  That's why, a N is generally worth more then a B.  That's not all the time, but more often then not.  As, GM Susan Polgar also illustrated when she answered my question on when to exchange making the rule of thumb to trade off the opponents N for your B, and when I have questions, I follow this rule without hesitation.  } 13. g4 {Bob's idea of a good time is exchanging pieces.  But, Victor has the same idea since, in a different form, a variation involving exchanges (what I, thereby, call an exchange variation is about to occur.)} Bxg4 14. Bxg4 Nxg4 15. Qxg4 Nxc2 16. Nb5 {As white, I would've played 16.Ra2 to protect the Rook.  Aside from that, nothing else would've come into consideration, but I guess Bob feels that black's Nc2 is more dangerous.  Unlike with a normal game, I do see the point since GM's see things that we don't.  } Nxa1 17. Nxa1 Qc6 {Victor is, obviously, going for Bob's, e4 pawn, in which he protects with 18.f5  But, as white, I wouldn't have looked at anything else, aside from 18.Re1 with an interesting variation which I don't think would've worked out.  But, that would not have changed my thought process in any shape or form because in a normal game, if black weren't careful, white would get a passed pawn much later on.  And, with a passer, a Rook behind it is very powerful and useful.  With that being said, however, white protects in a very interesting way as he is threatening to exchange pawns.  As black, I would've excepted, for after 18.f5, I would go ahead and play 18...gxf5  But, I like black's 18th move even better since white's Rf1 is attacked.  What that shows is that I need to give things a little more thought.  I should've learned this with Ken when giving these kinds of answers combined with him pointing out why they don't work.  But, seeing it from a GM game is going to help me learn even more.  For, protecting it means that he'll lose another pawn which is why 18...gxf5?! isn't necessary.  What it boils down is trying to be more mobile in my assessment because there is a lot when the Queen goes to c4.   } 18. f5 Qc4 19. Qf3 Qxa4 20. Nc7 {Knowing the way that I think, this does not seem to bother Bob, since he is threatening the Rook.  But, what comes is very interesting.  Instead of defending it, Victor's next move is 20...Qxa1.  I, however, would've defended the Ra8 since losing a Rook appears to always be worst as it is a major piece.  But, this is where what Jack says is true.  In this case, the N is worth more, as it's more powerful, mobile, and dangerous.  Therefore, I think that Victor made the right choice by taking on a1.} Qxa1 21. Nd5 {On the other hand, my next move would have been 21.Nxa8 to get back a Rook for Knight.  Beside's that, nothing else would've come into consideration, as I would feel that I've gotten counterplay by doing that.  But, Bob plays this.  My inference is similar to before being that the N is more important, in this position.  And, with this move, the N visualization is even more so at the top of my mind.} Rae8 {I also would've played 21...Rfe8, as this also centralizes the Rook, whilst, preventing what follows later on. } 22. Bg5 {With Bob's Nd5, Victor's Rf8 is under pressure.  But, as we'll see later on, he views that Rook as not important.  It'll be interesting to see why.  With that being said, when Victor takes on b2, that pressure becomes inevitable.  For, when Bob takes back, he will exchange the Rook for Bishop.  I guess that black kept that in mind which would mean, in my opinion, that white's Bg5 is worth more then black's Rf8.  I see why as it is also more mobile, and that's based on Ken's advice to assess things from a more mobile perspective then what I've doing lately.} Qxb2 23. Bxe7 Be5 {To delay the capture, Victor threatens mate in such a way that Bob's next move is forced.  This is significant because of what follows later on, leaving white with virtually no counterplay, as we'll see later on.  } 24. Rf2 Qc1+ 25. Rf1 {I, however, would've gotten out of check with 25.Kg2.  From there, not only wouldn't I feel any more pressure, but despite being behind, just like in my recent game with Ken, I'd feel even more comfortable.  That's because the white's Rook on f2 appeared to give more protection to the K.  I say that because of what happens next, in which, mate is threatened again.  In exchange, Bob's 26th move is also forced. In which, black will get the needed Bishop for the less mobile Rook.  And, that, in my opinion is what will leave white with a hopeless position, as he needs the Be7 to prevent what's coming.  } Qh6 26. h3 gxf5 27. Bxf8 Rxf8 28. Ne7+ {Bob does what he can to hold back the attack.  For, after getting out of check, Bob will get back the pawn and attack the Queen.  But, as we're going to see, it's not enough.} Kh8 29. Nxf5 Qe6 30. Rg1 {I'm not sure why Bob played.  Perhaps, he was thinking in terms of a long variation that would result in mate.  Going by the thought process, maybe, he was thinking along the lines of driving Victors Be5 back.  That would result in something like Rg5, and then moving the Nf5 for a discovered.  And, then perhaps bringing the Rook back and playing Qg4, in which, white threatens Qg7#  In that case, my inference is that he's going for a swindle.} a4 {But, this is where it becomes evident to me that Bob has no chance of counterplay.  As now, Victor has just pushed his passed.  And, without his DSB, there is no way to stop.  That's why, in this position, it was worth more then black's Rook.  So, it turns out, that black didn't need it, and therefore, gave it up to get that Bishop; as now there is nothing that white can do about that passer.} 31. Rg4 {I'm not sure why Bob played, but my guess that he's trying to do something with the e pawn.  Perhaps, his goal is to get a passed pawn, so that black promotes, he can do it as well and hope for a draw.} Qb3 {But, if that was the plan, it won't work since Victor is now supporting the passed pawn with his Queen.  And, yes this is an example of where getting that semi open file is important because that's what often leads to a passed pawn, as theory indicates.  I say that because, unless I misunderstood (which often happens) this is what Joe was alluding to by a semi open file.  For in that game, that's what allowed the passer, as well, as it involved the very same pawn that opened the file.} 32. Qf1 {Doing what he can, Bob tries to stop it, for white thinks that if Victor breaks through and promotes, he'll take with the Queen.  And, to be honest, that's how I've also been known to think in my games.  But, black's next move is an example of where I'd be wrong.  } a3 {As now, the pawn has even more support from Victor's Queen.} 33. Rg3 {As the court of last resort, Bob, for the last time, tries to stop the promotion with this move.  This, however, is now Hope Chess.  As black has an added threat.  He's hoping that black doesn't see that and retreats.  Doing this would allow Rxa3, which would, in return, stop that pawn.} Qxg3 {But, Victor sees it by taking the Rook.  And, Bob resigns.  As white, however, it would've been the reverse, as I would've resigned earlier.  But, this move would've stopped me from doing so, as I would not have hesitated to take back with Nxg3 which appears to win the Queen back for a N.  As I used to think, now what.  In other words, what can black do.  But, I know the answer with a similar study from Jack Stockel.  Without the N there, black would later play ...a2 which would promote.  And, there's nothing that white can do about.  And, after promoting, white doesn't get anything else in return, so it is a hopeless position.  Therefore, even from (at the time) the world champion, I find resignation to be appropriate.  }
