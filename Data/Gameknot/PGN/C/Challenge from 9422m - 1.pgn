[Opening "King's gambit (C30)"]

1. e4 {I was challenged first by todorov and declined. Later I thought since he challenged me I should accept the challenge and so I challenged him back as White (the original challenge was me being White). I think it was a screw up because I was trying to post an acceptance (I always accept a challenge to me personally it's like being called out on the school grounds to have it out and I always went to fight the challenger.  This is really grade school of me to feel this way at 55 but there it is. So I re-instated the game for todorov.   Naturally I like this open and tend to favor it over my other favorite open, d4. } e5 {Well. You should know me by now. I always always always use the King's Gambit against the Ruy Lopez and here I get to do it again. } 2. f4 {Thusly. } d6 {It is a "King's Gambit Declined" with this one move where e5xf4 does not occur. } 3. d3 {Making my infantry develop while now protecting the Gambit Pawn...} Nc6 {Perhaps Black doe not think King's Gambit (an attack on King Side by White that rapidly develops) is enough to worry about on the King Side. } 4. Nf3 {I am rapidly putting myself into a King Side Attack regardless of Black's intentions on the Queen Side. } f6 {He decides to open his King Side a bit as I have already risked on my side. } 5. Be2 {I am a bit cramped but not enough to get things in motion for a King Side Attack. } Be7 {Black is already cramped at this point. } 6. O-O {Arranging my rook on the F rank as per usual (also to make the E rank available for artillery fire). } d5 {Another move by Black would be to check my King into H8--I would have expected that and be a little slower on the King Side Attack. But by now I am in motion to really put on an assault. } 7. exd5 {My pawns are doing the Assault. } Qxd5 {He brings out the most powerful piece on the board--but too early. } 8. Nc3 {I attack the most powerful piece on the board. } Qf7 {Black felt safer with her next to his King. } 9. fxe5 {I need to clear the way some more with that original offered up pawn that was declined in taking (then it would have been "King's Gambit Accepted." } Qg6 {His Knight is trapped by his own men on the King Side. The Queen can jockey about to try and do damage this early in the open but usually by this time if she is out and retreating and repositioning she is going to do so for awhile longer. } 10. Nd5 {Threatening Nxc7 for the fork. } Bd8 {Protecting the fork action. } 11. Nd4 {Clearing my d1 to h5 diagonal with power...threatening c6 Knight with no seeming back-up to do so. However....} h5 {He saw the pin to his Queen in front of his King and decided to leave my offered Knight alone. } 12. Nf4 {I just bring him back to attack the exposed (too early) Queen. } Qh7 {She hides away. } 13. Bxh5+ {I take another pawn and check at the same time. } Kd7 {His King is on the run without a safe haven. } 14. Qg4+ {I ensure that the King continues to run someplace where I can get to him to checkmate. } f5 {Merely a diversion but a good one to help the King last longer. } 15. e6+ {A check with my passed pawn will make the King on the run again. } Kd6 {So he is running now to find shelter. } 16. Nxf5+ {Not much choice for Black with this move. } Kc5 {Running....} 17. a4 {Trapping with my A rank pawn before diving in....} Kb6 {Ensconcing King about to see the end about there....} 18. Nd5+ {A chase but the best I felt I could do with what I had to cage the King. } Kc5 {I knew ahead there was only 3 moves the King could make with this. He chose this move which ends in checkmate. } 19. Qc4# {And there it is. }
