[Opening "Queen's gambit accepted (D20)"]

1. d4 {I always begin with d4.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 {Gueen's Gambit Accepted.} 3. Nc3 c6 4. Nf3 h6 {This is an odd move. It stops Bg5, but it felt unnecessary at this point. Black should get going with developing his minor pieces - he will be behind in development soon.} 5. e4 {I seize the centre while black has no pawns nor minor pieces control the central squares. Furthermore, this opens up a diagonal to c4 to win back the gambited pawn.} b5 {?! dubious. Black chooses to defend his pawn instead of staking a claim to the centre. Another move gone without developing a minor piece. If black does not play correctly now, he could easily find himself on the back foot.} 6. h4 {?! - I felt in an aggressive mood, and I thought I would get a pawn storm marching since black has not moved a single minor piece!} a6 {? - This is a truly terrible move in my opinion. Black already had a pawn supporting b5, and this closes the option of Na6. After 6 moves, black has still not moved any pieces! I probably would have considered Nf6 or even Bg4. Any ideas on the best course of action here for black?} 7. Ne5 {?! - the aggression continues. This targets the c6 pawn should black move his knight, and opens up paths for the f pawn to continue my planned pawn storm. This is probably not the best move in this position. However, it certainly is aggressive!} e6 {Black blocks in his LSB, which now becomes a weak bishop. I assume he wanted to start developing kingside to castle and get out of danger. However, I already have a pawn storm brewing.} 8. g4 {! - Black chooses not to develop, so I continue the plan to rip away black's kingside defences and start an attack. I would give myself a slight edge at this point, considering black's lack of a single developed piece.} Nd7 {Black loses his c6 pawn, but the pawn can be won back, and black can uncramp his position slightly. I didn't see the variation of black winning back the pawn.} 9. Nxc6 Qc7 10. Ne5 Nxe5 11. dxe5 Qxe5 {Black regains his pawn and is not looking terrible at the moment, but not great either.} 12. f4 {I drive the queen away and continue the kingside expansion.} Qc5 13. Bg2 {I develop my bishop, eyeing a discovered attack on black's a8 rook. I'm considering kingside castling if I can drive away the queen at this point, but in retrospect, the kingside is terribly exposed if black can mount a counter challenge.} Ra7 {Black sees the discovered attack and gets out of the way, giving the rook more scope than Rb8.} 14. Qe2 {The aim here was to skewer queen and rook with Be3.} Rd7 {Black gets away and seizes the open file.} 15. Bd2 {Since no skewer is available anymore, I get ready for long castling to contest the open file.} Qc7 {Not sure what the point of this move is. Any thoughts?} 16. O-O-O {Completing development while black still has 3 undeveloped minor pieces!} Ne7 17. f5 {Continuing the storm now that my king is in safety.} exf5 18. exf5 {He takes, I take back.} Kd8 {?? I assume he was trying to unpin his knight but I can't see the point in this.} 19. Qe1 {At this point I've spotted a nice trick, now that black's king and queen line up on the same diagonal.} Bb7 {Black doesn't see it, or does and underestimates it, and targets my bishop.} 20. Nxb5 {!! - the threat on my bishop is ignored for now. If black recaptures with axb5, I counter with Ba5 and win the black queen.} Qc5 {A reasonable counter to my plan.} 21. Ba5+ {! - Gaining tempo and starting to mount a potentially dangerous attack on black's exposed king. I have almost all my pieces aimed towards the black king, with the exception of my Rh8. This move wins a piece.} Ke8 {I now have the LSB.} 22. Bxb7 {Notice that black cannot take the bishop because of Rd8#!} Qxb5 {Black equalizes material and threatens my LSB at the same time. But I still maintain the tempo with my next move.} 23. Rxd7 {Either the king is lured into the open or the queen lines itself on the same diagonal as the king} Qxd7 24. Qe4 {With the threat of Bc6 - however, I did not see that black actually does not lose material necessarily. e.g. 25. Bc6 Qxc6 26. Qxc6 Nxc6. However, I can then follow up with Re1 and the king is still exposed.} Qb5 {Threatening my unprotected bishop, but this move is fatal. Can you see the move which wins the game?} 25. Rd1 {!! - multiple threats here. If black takes my DSB, I have Bc6#! If he attempts to create a hole for his king to escape, I still mate swiftly e.g. 25... f6 26. Rd8+ Kf7 27. Qe6#} Qxa5 {Black has nothing to do, and hopes I didn't see my own mate.} 26. Bc6# {A neat checkmate. The king is blocked in by his own pieces, the knight is pinned, and the rook controls the open file. A nice game from me, I think.}
