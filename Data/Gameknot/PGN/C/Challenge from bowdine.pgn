1. d4 d5 2. h4 {That move threw me for a loop, but didn't cause me to stray from my normal developmental steps.  I don't know if your intention was to distract me or not, but you did get my attention... lol} Nc6 3. e3 e5 4. dxe5 {That's a good move to make anytime you see your opponent is approaching the game with a plan; plus, capturing towards the center of the board is one of the fundementals of Opening Move strategy (or so I've read).} Nxe5 5. Qd4 {Now you're dictating my defense which is a good strategy to have.} f6 6. h5 h6 7. a4 {Again, that move caught me off guard and made me think about what you were up to.} Ne7 8. Rh4 Ne7c6 9. Qd2 Be6 10. g3 Nc4 11. Qc3 Nc6e5 12. Qb3 c6 13. a5 a6 14. Nh3 {Here I have an opportunity for a fork; if I move my Knight to F3, you are in check and I have the freedom to take your Rook....} Bd6 {But I didn't see it...} 15. Nf4 {Opportunity is still there....} Bf5 {And I miss it again because of tunnel vision...} 16. Ng6 Bxg6 17. hxg6 Nf3+ {Finally I notice... lol} 18. Ke2 Nxh4 19. gxh4 Qe7 20. Nd2 Nxd2 21. Bxd2 Qe4 22. Qxb7 O-O 23. Qxc6 {Great strategy in taking out those Pawns... Anytime you have a chance to take a piece without loosing one yourself, you're doing something right.} Rfd8 24. Bh3 Qxg6 25. Be6+ Kh8 26. Qxd5 Qxc2 27. Rg1 Bf8 {Bad move on my part; I could have set up to capture your Bishop on D2} 28. Qg2 Qxd2+ {I still think I should've taken that Bishop with my own Bishop... lol} 29. Kf3 g5 30. Qg4 Qd6 31. Qf5 Qc6+ 32. e4 Rd3+ 33. Kg4 Be7 34. hxg5 fxg5 35. Qe5+ Kh7 36. Bf5+ Kg8 37. Qxe7 Re8 38. Qh7+ Kf8 39. f4 Rxe4 40. Bxe4 Qc8+ 41. f5 Rd2 42. Qh8+ Kf7 43. Qxc8 Kf6 44. Qc3+ Kf7 45. Qxd2 Kg7 46. Qd4+ Kg8 47. Bd5+ Kf8 48. Qh8+ Ke7 49. f6+ Kd7 50. Qh7+ Kd6 51. Rd1 h5+ 52. Kxg5 h4 53. f7 h3 54. f8=Q+ Ke5 55. Qhg7# {Well played on your part... After the game got going, I didn't have much to say.  You over came that early Rook capture on my part and played strong at the end to systematically take down my Queen and two Rooks... Good game!
