1. e4 {Not the first annotation from me and most likely not the last.... I took an unforeseen jump at an unsound attack and want to show how my opponent might have helped get himself out of it to begin with.} c5 {This is the favorite response to e4 here on this site. The classic Sicilian.} 2. Nc3 d6 {Closed variation. } 3. f4 {This attack sequence is well known...can't remember the correct name of it though..} Nf6 4. Bc4 {staying ahead in development.} e6 {lot of pawns being pushed around here... perhaps necessary to continue matching my own development, then again not to sure on that.} 5. Nf3 {I have yet to confirm with computer analysis that I may have the lead in the positional portion of this game... I'll bet not by much though.} d5 6. exd5 {Opens the game some, but if you check out most of my past games.... I rarely open up and get aggressive.... playing some with easy19 might just begin to swing my liking open games.... you play him.... he'll kill you also!!!} exd5 7. Qe2+ {Attempting to realize an advantage in piece activity. Would like to formally invite all who would like to assist in this annotation to do so..PLEASE! After all, easy19 makes you feel real ordinary.} Be7 {Had to move it and went the aggressive route.} 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Ne5 {Got the lead in mobilization so I went with total aggression.} d4 {Now some trouble, must exchange I think.} 10. Ne4 {Well, I decided to keep on keeping on.} O-O 11. Ng5 {rare is it that I get this far afield with my troops... I really ever do this and wish my future opponents well.....} Bxb5 12. Qxb5 {I get an impromptu pawn attack.} b6 13. O-O {keeping up with the Jones's.} a6 14. Qb3 {Was eyeing d3 also for her.} Nd5 {Not an expected move, so I took time to look at this(not analyze)} 15. Nxh7 {Without analysis, I gave this a try....} Kxh7 16. Qh3+ {Thought I may open lines of attack or win a pawn... anyway my position seems to squelch black being able to have a coordinated mobilization of forces.} Kg8 17. f5 {This move I just felt as though the greater area(space) to work in and that this pawn could in the future be put to good use.} Bd6 {Most certain that Nf6 may have helped defend..} 18. Ng4 {This was not at all the moves I was hoping would take place when I sacrificed the Knight.} Re8 {I think Nd7 may have been best here.........} 19. d3 {Oh yea, now I remember another part of the reasoning for 17.  f5  was to allow this file fully to be utilized by my DSB(dark squared Bishop)} Nb4 {Here is when I know that this move is not in the best interest of bishopric.... then again I am lost to find the right move for him at this time.....} 20. f6 {I will soon have comp. analysis for us to see if this is easily refuted....} Bf8 {Some defense is best} 21. Bg5 {I looked at Bh6 and the attack in most directions I looked stalled and faltered.} Qd5 {This may be a blunder.... we will see...} 22. fxg7 {Now due to the mate threat, black now has little but forced moves, til end of game....} Bxg7 23. Nf6+ Bxf6 24. Bxf6 Qxg2+ 25. Qxg2+ {Where upon resignation was accepted..... so please help this annotation with all kind of input.... especially the kind that may keep me in check from being this crazed aggressive.... til then, hope your games improve exponentially!(ALL)}
