1. c4 {This game is a coaching game to the benefit of yurigagarin. The comments are primarely adressed to him, but I hope all can enjoy it too.  For an Englishman, it is normal to play the English opening.} e5 {I do not like symmetrical openings.} 2. g3 {And now an italian fiachetto. This union will produce bilingual children} c6 {It is a good idea to immediately remove some of the sting from the enemy fianchetto.} 3. Bg2 Bc5 4. Nf3 d6 5. d4 exd4 6. Nxd4 Nf6 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bf4 O-O 9. Nc3 a6 10. O-O Re8 {Not much to say so far. The basic principles of opening play were generally respected. Get the pieces out, get the king to safety. White naturally maintains a slight advantage in development.} 11. e3 {But this is a blunder. Which brings me to my advice number 2 (I have prepared a list of advices to throw in at the right moment).   Advice no 2 : The great escape. One of the obvious things you can check before making the move you have chosen is : If you have a piece that is more advanced in the enemy’s territory, be sure that piece has an escape route, and that it can not be trapped by the opponent’s pieces (or pawns). This is especially true if that piece is your queen.  Of course, this advice can be reversed. You can check if you can trap an enemy piece. } g5 12. Qd2 {Is this the best move? We'll see later.} gxf4 {I was tempted to play Bg4, since I don't have to take the bishop right away. But it is a mistake. Why?} 13. exf4 {My opponent told me he was a bit worried about opening the e file ; is this justified? would it be better to take with the g pawn?   to be followed ...} Bxd4 {I consider this move a must. Even though black has won a piece for a pawn, the black king can come under severe attack if black does not take direct action.  Reason number one for this move : when you are ahead in material, exchange pieces, as Confucius would have said if chess had been invented in his epoch (or was it?). Here, this general principle applies doubly, as the white knight was dangerously placed. And, as a bonus, the white queen no longer threatens, even if inderectly, the weak h6 pawn. But black will still have to be very careful to get his pieces out and come to the rescue of the king. } 14. Qxd4 Bf5 {Let's hurry getting my pieces to the rescue!} 15. Rad1 {Yes! I'm not out of trouble yet.} Re6 {It actually took me a while to find this simple move. Sometimes trying to analyse too deeply gets you in trouble, forgetting simple moves.} 16. Qd2 {White goes back to his original plan (target h6).} Nbd7 {Like in any good western, the cavalry comes in near the end. Anyway, it's the obvious move. I can't leave the knight and rook in the corner while the others are sweating like hell to protect the king. After all, this is war, and all soldiers must participate.} 17. g4 {White decides to take radical action. Is this the right way?} Bxg4 {Safer would be taking with the knight. But one must take chances in life.} 18. f5 {Consistent with the plan} Bxf5 19. Qxh6 Qf8 {Here is the time to stop and check about white's plan. The idea was to attack the weak h6 pawn while also opening the g file. Excellent plan. But here it falls short because the execution is faulty. It would have been better to first play the king to h1, then put the rook on the g file, and then push the pawns. The problem with the present position is that the queen is alone to try and attack the king, while the black pieces are all relatively well placed to replace the missing pawns in front of the king. But with the rook ready to come in, it would have been a different story. Of course, during all this preparation, black would have had time to regroup. But at least, this leaves a chance for error on the black side, if he does not prepare well to meet white's plan.} 20. Qg5+ Bg6 21. Bh3 {I feel this bishop would have been better played at f3. See why later.} Re5 {One could easily say : black is lucky to have this move now, and it is true I had not foreseen it. But then, this illustrates a common feature of open positions : if your pieces are soundly placed, such moves will readily be available. What do I mean by pieces soundly placed? Let's check here : the two knights protect each other, the queen protects the weak d6 pawn, the bishop is protected by the pawn, the rook is protected by the (weak but living) d6 pawn, the other rook, queen and king all offer mutual protection. Pieces are soundly placed when they control a lot of ground, and they protect each other. } 22. Qf4 {Is Qd2 better? White would probably win the weak d6 pawn (also justifying the bishop at h3) but this is a price black is ready to play for the exchange of queens. So, I agree with white's choice.} Rae8 {Getting the last piece out. Principle # 126 of the book of wisdom of chess : place rooks on open files. And speaking of soundness, the two rooks protect each other too.} 23. Rxd6 {A blunder. This type of error occurs when an enemy piece is sort of hidden, like black's queen at f8, just standing there quietly, trying not to get noticed. And white did not notice. A trick is to try and spot early these hidden pieces and always keep in them in the back of your mind.} Qxd6 {Here a funny move would be for white to play the rook to d1, apparently winning a knight. But black has an equally funny reply... Think about it.} 24. Qh6 Rh5 {And white resigned.  Two lessons to be gathered here : Muster up your pieces before attacking, and always check if your pieces protect each other: or if you must have an unprotected piece, check at every move if something bad could happen to it (like a mother checking for her 4-year old son near a pool).}
