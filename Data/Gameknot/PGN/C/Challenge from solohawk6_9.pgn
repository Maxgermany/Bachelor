1. e4 {Solohawk and I have played many times, and although I do play d4 sometimes, I prefer e4 most of the time. I like to open the position and get rid of the major pieces. My feeling is that I can outplay my opponent if we both just have minor pieces. I usually am content to win a pawn in the opening and then just grind out a winning endgame.} e5 {Solohawk almost always answers e4 with ...e5. If he ever played a Sicilian, French, or Caro-Kann, I would probably die of a heart attack. I believe he has played the Scandinavian, but it is rare for him to vary from ...e5.} 2. Nf3 {Considered the best move as it develops a piece with an attack.} Nc6 {A standard reply that defends the e-pawn with a developing move. Other replies are playable, but this is by far the most popular.} 3. d4 {This move initiates the Scotch Game. It is an attempt by white to continue the attack on black's central pawn. Although black can achieve equality in most lines, the Scotch Game has experienced a resurgence since Kasparov started playing it.} exd4 {Refusing this capture leads to an advantage for white, so this move is almost forced.} 4. Nxd4 {The main line, although white can enter the Scotch Gambit with Bc4.} Nxd4 {Black varies from theory and lets white have a central space advantage. Main line moves are ...Nf6 and ...Bc5. Also playable is Steinitz's ...Qh4.} 5. Qxd4 {Forced to maintain material equality. This is an optimal pawn structure for white in an e4 opening. Black's remaining central pawn will be on the third rank, while white's is on the fourth.} Ne7 {A somewhat awkward development for a piece that belongs on f6, but black was afraid of e5, when the knight has no where to go. By blocking the a3-f8 diagonal, it will be hard for the dark bishop to develop.} 6. Bc4 {White simply develops a piece that prepares castling on the next move. Both sides are also fighting for control of the d5 square. If black could play ...d5 and trade off white's central pawn, white's space advantage would disappear.} c6 {Helping to prepare ...d5, and maybe creating a diagonal for the queen to use.} 7. O-O {White takes care of king safety, which is one of the main goals in the opening.} d5 {And black has achieved the pawn break that will free his position.} 8. exd5 {I played this move automatically, but looking back, I should have given some thought to: 8. Bd3 dxe4 9. Qxd8  Kxd8 10. Bxe4 This would achieve my goal of getting the queens off. Maybe next time...} cxd5 {It is clear that black will end up with an isolated d-pawn at the end of the exchanges on d5. The only question is how many pairs of pieces will leave the board before the pawn recaptures. With this move, black keeps as much material as possible on the board. If he had played ...Nxd5, I would have replied 9. Bxd5. And if he then captured with the queen, I would have traded queens as well.} 9. Bb3 {Solohawk told me he expected Bd3, but I wanted to keep the isolated d-pawn under attack. Also, it is pretty clear that black can't castle long, so this keeps the bishop trained on the square the black king will end up on.} Be6 {Overprotecting the d-pawn with a developing move, but on this square, the bishop is little more than a glorified pawn.} 10. Nc3 {Developing, and continuing to pressure black's d-pawn.} h6 {Apparently to preclude Bg5, but black needs to figure out what to do with his dark bishop. Perhaps he should play ...Nf5 to let the bishop out, but white's development is more harmonious than black's in any event.} 11. Be3 {The last minor piece gets developed, and now white can bring his rooks to the central files and create some serious pressure. If black doesn't get his king to safety, he could come under a strong attack.} Nf5 {Chasing the queen, threatening to trade off white's dark bishop, and opening the diagonal so black's dark bishop can get developed. A fine move!} 12. Ba4+ {But white is not going to allow black the time to fix his problems.} Ke7 {The king doesn't want to move, but the queen can't interpose, and if the bishop interposes, then the d-pawn falls to white's queen.} 13. Nxd5+ {When I played this sac, I didn't have any concrete win in mind, but I thought the attack was justified on positional grounds: white is ahead in development, black's king is stuck in the center, and white has rooks ready to occupy both open central files.} Qxd5 {Offering to trade queens to help break the attack.} 14. Qb4+ {The attacker does not usually want to trade pieces, so I avoid the trade of queens with a check.} Nd6 {Interposing always pins the piece that interposes.} 15. Rad1 {So I pressure the pinned knight, while getting a rook to an open central file.} Qe5 {The only square that doesn't drop the knight on the spot.} 16. Bc5 {Piling up pressure on the pinned piece.} Rd8 {The only defense to losing the knight.} 17. f4 {Deflecting the queen from the protection of the knight will win the knight.} Qf5 {As good a square as any.} 18. Bxd6+ {I looked at alternatives, but couldn't find anything better than regaining the sacrificed material.} Kf6 {Forced.} 19. Be5+ {Discovering an attack on the undefended rook on d8. But I fail to see that it also leaves my own queen en prise to the bishop on f8.} Kg6 {Again, forced.} 20. Rxd8 {I should have bailed out of the attack with Qxb7. That would leave me up two pawns, and the c pawn would be passed. That is exactly the type of position I like to have. All I would need to do is trade off the pieces and get to a won endgame. But instead, I blunder with the text move.} Bxb4 {And black is quick to remove my queen from the board.} 21. Rxh8 {I do get two rooks for the queen, so material is about even, but my pieces are not coordinating very well right now, and black's queen could get very active. I consider black to be better here.} Bxa2 {Black picks up a stray pawn. Now if he could get white's b-pawn, black's a-pawn would be passed.} 22. c3 {I start to envision a plan to get back into the game. The black king and queen are lined up nicely. If I could get rook protection on the c2 square, I could play Bc2 and pin the queen. I don't really want to chase black's dark bishop to a better square, but I need to get my pawn off c2 to make way for the bishop.} Bc5+ {This is an excellent square for this bishop, as it anchors the pawn on a7, and keeps white's king trapped in the corner.} 23. Kh1 {I considered Bd4, but didn't like the position after: 23. Bd4 Bxd4  24. cxd4 Separating the queenside pawns makes it easier for black's queen to pick them off, and I can't allow black to make the a and b-pawns passed. The problem with the text move is that it indirectly pins white's g-pawn. Moving the g-pawn would allow ...Qe4 , followed by mate next move.} f6 {The bishop doesn't have very many safe places to go to, but I think black should have considered the weakness of the a8-h1 diagonal and played either ...Bd5 or ...Qg4. If black focuses on the g2 square, it will keep white tied up and passive.} 24. Bc7 {The best available square, although the bishop seems out of play here.} Kh5 {This is a curious move. Hard to know what black's plan was, but perhaps he was considering a pawn storm starting with ...g5.} 25. Rd8 {The rook needs to get back into the game, and from here he can head to d2. That will give the light bishop the protection he needs to pick up the queen if the king and queen align again.} a6 {Seems like a waste of time, and I think black still should be activating the queen and light bishop.} 26. Bd1+ {I considered Be8 , but didn't see anything good in it, so decided to give black some rope and see if he would hang himself. The second reason I played the bishop here is to get it to f3 where it helps protect against the mate threat on g2.} Kg6 {This is what I was hoping for: the king and queen are aligned again.} 27. Rd2 {So I protect c2 and theaten to win the queen with Bc2 next move.} Be3 {Black either doesn't see the threat or decides to get a rook and piece for his queen. But that is a bad bargain, and this is the losing move. When the dust settles, white will have a won endgame.} 28. Bc2 {As planned.} Bxd2 {Black gets a rook.} 29. Bxf5+ {White gets the queen.} Kxf5 {And black gets the piece, but this leaves black down the exchange. With the two bishops, black can put up some tough resistance, but I think white should have a win in this position.} 30. Rd1 {The rook must get active.} Bxf4 {This is a positional blunder that hastens the end for black. While black has both bishops he can control both colors. But by trading the dark bishops, black loses the ability to control the dark squares. White's rook maintains the ability to control both colored squares, and this will be crucial in the upcoming endgame.} 31. Bxf4 {I am more than happy to trade off a pair of bishops, as my rook will dominate his light bishop.} Kxf4 32. Rd7 {I give black a tough choice. If he protects the b-pawn, I isolate his f and h-pawns from each other. If he protects the g-pawn, I take the b-pawn which makes my c-pawn a passer.} g6 {Black lets me have a passed c-pawn.} 33. Rxb7 Kg5 {The king is going in the wrong direction. I am going to be pushing my passed c-pawn, and black should have played ...Ke5 to head toward the c-file.} 34. Rb4 {Threatening Ra4 to win the a-pawn, but also protecting c4 so the c-pawn can step across it.} Be6 {Black can now protect the a-pawn from c8, while at the same time, blockading the c-file.} 35. c4 {Bobby Fischer said, "Passed pawns must be pushed!" And I am not one to quarrel with a World Champion. At least about chess.} h5 {Black has a 3-2 majority on the kingside, so he can eventually create a passed pawn of his own, but it will take too much time. The c-pawn is already on the move!} 36. c5 {From b4, the rook protected the pawn when it crossed a light square. The pawn doesn't need protection on dark squares, and the rook just has to go to b6 to protect the pawn on the light c6 square. Black is really missing his dark bishop about now.} Bd7 {Trying to blockade the passer.} 37. Rb6 {The bishop is just no match for the rook.} Bc8 {Black's final stand.} 38. c6 {White is relentless.} a5 {As good as any. At this point, it is a Borg game: Resistance is futile.} 39. c7 {Only one step away.} a4 40. Rb8 {White removes the blockader. Nimzowitsch would be proud!} Bf5 41. c8=Q {White forces black to surrender the bishop.} Bxc8 42. Rxc8 {White is a full rook up and black has no counterplay.} f5 {Black decides to play on anyway.} 43. Ra8 {Taking out the a-pawn will make the b-pawn a passer.} Kg4 {Again, the black king goes the wrong way. Black can't stop the b-pawn from queening, but if he is to play on, he should at least try.} 44. Rxa4+ {White is up a rook and has a passed pawn. Black could resign here with a clean conscience.} f4 {Black chooses to slog on.} 45. b4 {The b-pawn is off to the races.} h4 46. b5 h3 47. Rxf4+ {Since the black king can no longer catch the b-pawn, white decides to sac the unnecessary rook for one of black's pawns.} Kxf4 48. b6 hxg2+ 49. Kxg2 g5 50. b7 {And black has had enough. 1-0}
