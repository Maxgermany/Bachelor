1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Opening with Sicilian Najdorf} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3 e6 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Be2 Be7 8. f3 {Normal Development} d5 {Black Trying to gain control of vital d5 Square!} 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. exd5 cxd5 {Black Succeeds in Controlling d5! But the game is still not over for white..} 11. Bd4 {To Stop e5,..} O-O {Taking King to safety.} 12. Qd3 {Developing the queen as well as opening two possibilities for white to castle. } Re8 {King in the center so launching the attack immediately on the opposing king..!} 13. O-O-O {Its High time so castled Queen side bcoz there are less pawns on the queen side to launch an immediate attack on the white king also queen rook comes into play and attacks center.} Bd7 {Preparing a violent attack from queen side against white..!} 14. g4 {Counter Attack by g4..} Bd6 {Preparing e5 pawn thrust to control center and increase mobility for black bishop.} 15. g5 {Bf4+ would be defended by Be3 on exchange of bishops black would retreat his Knight to safer square then white would launch his attack on black king by using pawn thrust h4 or Rdg1..} Nh5 {Defending the Knight at the same time attacking the pawn with an opportunity to fork queen and bishop if white saves the pawn. Clearly Black has the upper hand over here I admit that black could have easily won by taking my light colored Bishop on e2. Again with two Bishops advantage over Knight and a Bishop along with good center control...!!} 16. Rdg1 {No other option but to guard the falling g-pawn. Rdg1 and not h4 since g3 then becomes vulnerable point for white where black's Knight can easily exploit.} Nf4 {As expected!} 17. Qd2 {Played purposely to invite Black to pin the Knight after e5 thrust.. idea (e5-Bf2 Bb4-Qd1 Nxe2 Nxe2.. Followed by Kb1 and Nc1)with defense for white king.} e5 {As anticipated..} 18. Bf2 Bb4 19. Qd1 d4 {Slight alteration to black's move He played d4 which is not a good move since it gives White Knight an Outpost on e4! and did not take my Bishop on e2 which was again wrong option.} 20. Ne4 {White is slowly but steadily coming back into the game and there is a hope to save the game by a draw!} Be6 {Threatening Qa5,,..  } 21. Kb1 Bf5 22. Bc4 Qc7 23. Bb3 {Solidifying the defense for white king..} Be6 {Trade offer.. ;) I will take it but in a different way I will offer another Bishop instead.. Haha.. that would really confuse the opponent.. and it worked..} 24. Be1 Bxb3 25. Bxb4 Bd5 26. Qe1 {Trying to prevent an isolated e4 pawn..} Qc4 27. b3 Qc6 28. Rg4 {Attempt to double the rooks and prepare h4 thrust..also with a threat of Nf6+ active..} d3 {Attacking the undefended c2 pawn with d3!} 29. c4 {c4!! Since now black cannot take it by enpass and Bishop has to retreat or take the Knight and then after exchanging the queens try to play for a draw,..} Be6 {Defending Bishop and attacking the rook at the same time!} 30. Rxf4 {Rxf4! I thought Knight on f4 was the active piece for Black which was attacking and defending the position at the same time so eliminating the active piece at once.. again Nf6+ is still ON..} exf4 {takes the rook with winning confidence.. White is a piece down!} 31. Qh4 {Qh4! again with brilliant attacking combination and a tactical move against Black's King.. Idea Nf6+ followed by Bc3 and Qh6 with Mate Net..} Bf5 {Trying to eliminate the knight.. If Knight moves d2+ is ON. But still its problem for black to save the King-side from strong attack by Knight Rook Queen and Bishop since all the white pieces are actively attacking the black's king. Time for an attack!!} 32. Nf6+ {Perfect Move in the tough situation. Pawn takes Knight is forced since white can equalize the situation with Nxe8.. } gxf6 33. gxf6 {Threat is Qh6! and Qg7#.. Can Black Stop it?? Answer is NO he can't!} d2+ {Desperation since he cannot stop the mate trying for a counter play..} 34. Kb2 Qxf3 {At this point Black should have resigned..} 35. Rg1+ {Worsens the situation for Black! only good move is Bg6..} Bg6 36. Qh6 {Qh6!! Final Nail to the coffin for black!! Mate cannot be stopped... ;) Hope you enjoyed the game! Cheers!! :D}
