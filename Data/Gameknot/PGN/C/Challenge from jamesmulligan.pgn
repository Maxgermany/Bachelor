[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {Erika starts off with her usual.  Of course, I told her that this is the most common opening.  And, not surprisingly, her opponents generally respond with 1...e5 which is also how my opponents often respond.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {This is now the Philidor's Defense.  It's sound but not the best defense.  Slightly better would've been to respond with the Petrov's Defense which is 2...Nf6, or 2...Nc6, which is how my opponents respond.  And, the reason being is because of what Erika should do next.} 3. Nc3 {I can understand this move since it develops.  But, best would've been 3.d4.  As noted, Erika, after 2.Nf3, when your opponent advances a pawn just one square, 3.d4 is the best way to follow up since you're breaking through in the center.  As now, you have line open for both of your Bishops, and even they're not out, yet, your Bc1 and Bf1 are both more mobile and, thus, active.} Be7 {I don't like this move that much since his Dark Squared Bishop is not as mobile as it could be.  As of the moment, it only covers 4 squares since the other path is gone.  This is why the Philidor's Defense isn't the best way to go.  If the d pawn hadn't blocked the Bishop, it would cover twice, so 8 squares.  It only seems minor, but how many squares a Bishop covers is also important as Grandmaster Susan Polgar has emphasized this.  As the amount they cover determines how mobile the Bishop is.  So, the more squares the merrier as they're more mobile.} 4. Bd3 {?! Not the best was to go about.  Like before, I understand why Erika played this since it develops.  But, as I and others have discussed with her, this blocks the center pawn which is not the best way to go about.  Better was 4.Bc4 or 4.Bb5.  In this position, being that it wasn't the Spanish Opening, I would've played 4.Bc4, as his Nb8 has not yet been developed.  So, after 4...c6 or 4...a6 white loses a tempo since the Light Squared Bishop would be forced to retreat.} a5 {I think that black's intention is to get the Rook on an open file.  But, this is not the best way to go.  That works when you become a master or above, since I have seen this being done with deeper_insight.  But, where black is, better would be to continue developing.  As black is way behind.  Right now, Erika only has one piece that isn't developed, but black only has one piece developed.  So, despite material being level, I favor white's position and reckon that she has a slight advantage.} 5. O-O {Bringing the monarch to safety which is a good way to go about.} Nf6 {We're finally seeing black develop another piece.  But, he still has two pieces left to bring into play.} 6. b3 {Fianchettoing, as the idea is to complete her development.} b6 {Black is thinking along a similar line, but he's bringing a pawn chain with it.} 7. a4 {As is Erika.  But, after fianchettoing, I would've completed it, as well as, my development with 7.Bb2.} O-O {Like Erika, black gets his King to safety, for now.} 8. Ba3 {At once, Erika completes her development.  The only criticism on white is that he still has two pieces to bring out.} Kh8 {And, the reason behind that comment with black is because of this move which does not develop.  I believe that his idea was to get to his monarch to safer spot since Coach Stockel said that after castling, you should bring your King to the corner.  But, it's about knowing when to do that, and this was not the time.  Better was to continue developing with 8...Bb7 or 8...Nc6.  And, with that being said, I like white's position even better then before because of her next move as she's about to put some pressure against black.} 9. b4 Rg8 {Ignoring the pressure, black plays this.  I don't know why he moved here, but given that an exchange can't be avoided, I would've developed with 9...Nc6  This way, after exchanging with 10.bxa5, after recapturing, black would be able to complete his develop since there are squares for his Bc8.} 10. bxa5 Rxa5 11. Ng5 {As now, Erika has a threat against black which can be driven off.  There's only one move that would do it, but Erika would still wind up with a better position.  Ok, what should black do, Erika? } Ne8 {?? And, black overlooks it.  I don't know why he played this either, but the solution was 11...Be6.  That was the only way to save black, but Erika would still be much better off as black would be forced to exchange his Light Squared Bishop for her Ng5, after 12.Nxe6  As there was a similar position to this that I studied with Coach Stockel.  It involved mating with the Knight, and the only way to drive it off would've been with the Bishop which is exactly what happened.  He then said that the best continuation was to exchange the Knight for Bishop.  I agree with this because Grandmaster Susan Polgar implied that, in general, Bishops are favorable over Knights.  That's when she gave advise not to exchange without a good reason, Susan was, specifically, talking about Bishop for Knight.  But, with this move, Erika can mate in one, and unlike with her previous annotations, white will not miss it, this time around.  Well done!} 12. Nxf7# {There are two important lessons to be learned from this game.  First, bring your pieces ASAP.  For example, black only had one piece developed until his fifth and remained with 2 pieces undeveloped throughout the rest of the game.  That allowed Erika to develop an attack where she had an advantage as black would've been forced into an unfavorable exchange in order to avoid mate.  The second is something that cplusplus11 stressed, "You must be aware of all threats made by your opponents, checkmate and captures."  This was one of them, or as Grandmaster Susan Polgar puts it, "You must ask yourself, what does my opponent want." }
