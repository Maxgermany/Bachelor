[Opening "French (C17), Winawer, advance, 5.a3"]

1. e4 e6 {The French, against which I have a poor record, both OTB and on-line.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {I used to play the Advance Variation (3. e5), following a book I'd bought but didn't like the positions I got.  Nowadays, I like to invite The Winawer (3. ...Bb4), which can lead to wild variations with Black making a mess of White's queenside and White counter-attacking.  Black can either take up the challenge or play one of a number of other moves (eg 3. ...c5, 3. ...Nc6, 3. ...dxe4, 3. ...Nf6 (Classical))} Bb4 {Black accepts the challenge ...} 4. e5 {It's useful, but not essential, to play this, so as to preserve the threatened pawn before trying to push Black's B away.} c5 {Black's standard follow-up, opening a diagonal for his Q and applying pressure on White's centre.} 5. a3 {White asks the B the question: swap or retreat?  Swapping is by far the most frequent response.} Ba5 {I have met this retreat before but couldn't remember how to respond, so had to have a think ...} 6. Bd2 {?! This does feature in Nunn's Chess Openings as a rare sideline.  Nunn gives 6. b4 as the best move and 6. dxc5 as an unclear continuation.  Nunn seems to regard this move as acceptable if followed up correctly.} cxd4 {White having cut off support for the d-pawn, Black snaffles it and attacks White's N.} 7. Nce2 {? Not considered by Nunn, who gives 7. Nb5 as the best response.  Although White threatens to recapture the pawn on d4 and attacks Black's B, the N blocks in White's kingside pieces.} Bc7 {Now Black attacks the loose pawn on e5.  If White captures on d4, the B captures on e5 and skewers the N against the pawn on b2.  White will have lost both his central pawns, leaving Black's solid centre unopposed.} 8. Nf3 Nc6 9. Nexd4 {Now that I can swap pieces on d4 or e5 if necessary, I decide to take the pawn on d4 while I can, releasing my LSB for action.} Nxd4 {I'd expected Black to capture on e5 but this makes sense as well, removing White's most advanced piece and forcing White to relinquish e5 to boot.} 10. Nxd4 Bxe5 {As predicted, Nd4 and pawn on b2 are skewered and I'm a serious pawn down with no compensation.  I'll have to play well to recover.  In trying to work out a plan, I now fell well behind on the clock.} 11. Bc3 {I decided that this was the most active method of defending the N, with my DSB disputing the long diagonal.  I also considered 11. c3, giving my Q scope on the d1-a4 diagonal but didn't think there would be much benefit in trying to exploit that while Black could simply play ....Bd7 if I tried to check on the a4-e8 diagonal.} Nf6 {Now every square on the long dark diagonal is occupied, Black is ready to castle and can then concentrate on exploiting his material advantage.} 12. Be2 {I, too, prepare to castle.  I also considered 12. Bb5+, but didn't want to invite swaps while still a pawn down, and 12. Bd3, but didn't want to block off the Queen's defence of d4.} a6 {Presumably to prevent 13. Nb5 or to support the pawn advance ...b5.  Now, with my B on e2 and the square b5 unavailable, I can't move my N and simultaneously provide a non-pawn defence of the Bc3.  I don't want the pawns on my queenside to be compromised if I can avoid it.} 13. O-O {I proceed with my development as quickly as I can, aiming to get my pieces posted on good squares and then to attack wherever I can find a potential weakness.} Bd6 {Unexpected ... I was surprised that Black seemed to be wasting tempi before he had castled.  As we didn't have the chance to analyse afterwards, I don't know the thinking behind this sequence of moves but I imagine he was looking to attack the Nd4 with his e-pawn and make an advanced salient with his central pawns.} 14. Re1 {I put my rook on the half-open e-file, hoping maybe to win back the pawn by capturing on d5 when the e-pawn is pinned but also preparing a lift to the third rank and possibly a redeployment of my LSB via f1} O-O {Black sensibly moves his King out of the line of fire.} 15. Nf3 {Now I wanted to advance my N to e5 or g5 to engage with Black's defences.} Re8 {Black contests the e-file and supports the advance of the e-pawn.} 16. Bd3 {With this move, I aimed at h7 while ensuring that Back couldn't advance his pawns with impunity: I had three pieces covering e5 while he had only 2 supporting the potential advance.} Bd7 {Black develops his last minor piece and prepares to occupy the c-file with his QR.} 17. Qd2 {The purpose of this move was to defend both Bc3 and the pawn on f2 against potential attacks, while connecting my rooks.  Once the QR was centralised, I'd be ready for more aggressive action.} h6 {Presumably Black didn't want my Q or N coming to g5} 18. h3 {So I took the opportunity to create a breathing space for my own K and prevent his N coming to g4, whence it would have attacked f2 and h2.} Rc8 19. Rad1 {I felt that this was potentially a more attacking square than c1.  My heart was set on a kingside attack now, as my bishops were already ideally deployed to rake his king's position and Black seemed to be concentrating mainly on the queenside.} Bc6 {Now Black seemed to be threatening ...d4 attacking my DSB and threatening a swap on f3 that would have ruined my kingside pawns.} 20. Be5 {I decided to avoid the idea mentioned in my last note by using this B to occupy e5, where eventually I wanted my N to be established.} Bxe5 {Surprisingly, Black cooperated.  I think he might have been better off letting me swap on d6 (if I wanted to) and using the recapture to develop his Q onto a strong square.} 21. Nxe5 {Now I was planning to lift a rook via e3 to f3 or g3 as appropriate and Q via f4 to the kingside for a direct kingside assault.  I wasn't sure how I would shift Black's N from f6 though.  Could I afford a pawn advance in front of my King?} Qb6 {Black pins my f-pawn and also threatens b2.} 22. c3 {Played to defend the b-pawn with my Q and inhibit Black from trying to occupy d4.  I also thought that I might be able to retreat my B to c2 or b1 and line up my Q and B against h7.} Ba4 {Annoying: either I block the attack on the Rd1 with my B and probably have it swapped off or I have to move the R to a less optimal square.} 23. Rdc1 Bb3 {This was played very quickly and had obviously been planned but it took me completely by surprise.  Presumably Black wanted to block my queenside pawns and possibly swap off a pair of minor pieces on c4, depriving my planned attack of the necessary forces.} 24. Qf4 {As the Q was no longer lumbered with the duty of defending b2 I hastened her off to the kingside, whence she still defended f2 but now looked directly through the Nf6 to f7.} Red8 {Another unexpected move.  Presumably Black was preparing a retreat for his N and also supporting a potential advance to d4.  I now gave serious consideration to Bh7+ with a view to taking f7 if Black captured either with King or N.} 25. g4 {However, I couldn't make that idea work, and decided instead to dislodge his N with a pawn thrust.  I didn't feel this was too risky as most of his forces were away on the queenside and I needed to prosecute my attack with speed and vigour.} Bc4 {As predicted, Black occupied c4 with his B, inviting me to swap minor pieces and threatening to capture the pawn on b2.  I decided that the pawn on b2 could be abandoned to its fate in the interest of not delaying my attack any more.  I was also happy to trust my Ne5 to defend the Bd3 for the time being. So ...} 26. g5 {I continued with my planned attack, hoping to open attacking lines to Black's king, not exactly at any cost but at least as quickly as I could.} hxg5 27. Qxg5 {Now my Q is diverted from defence of f2 and from attack on f7 but also has newly opened opportunities on the g and h files, if I can bring a rook or two to bear on them.} Bxd3 28. Nxd3 {This recapture seemed to catch my opponent by surprise (perhaps he'd overlooked it and thought he was winning  piece) but it works rather well.  OK the N is no longer attacking f7 but I was still some way from being able to make that work.  From d3, the N defends both b2 and f2, enabling me to move my K off the g-file (and Black's Queen's diagonal) and prepare a battery against g7.} Ne4 {Black's N, freed from defensive duty, occupies a threatening stronghold, attacking Qg5, pawns on c3 and f2 and potential tricks on g3 and d2.} 29. Qf4 {So I returned to f4, bolstering the defence of f2 while reasserting the threat to f7, if I could bring up another attacker.} Qc7 {Black offers to swap Queens, which would accentuate his pawn advantage (and much better pawn structure).} 30. Qh4 {Now I saw potential on the h-file, while maintaining over-defence of f2.} Qd6 {Not quite sure of the purpose of this, I had to think again carefully.  I presume that Black was contemplating ...d4 followed by a rook swap on the c-file.  The N would have to move first though, so I had another window of opportunity to prepare my attack.} 31. Kh1 {! I like this move.  Now I planned to play Rg1 and develop serious threats against Black's King.  I just had to watch out for N checks and forks.} Rc4 {This appears to threaten Nxf2+ with a discovered attack on White's Q but it doesn't yet work because the Q covers f2.} 32. Reg1 {So I ignored Black's manoeuvres and proceeded with my plan.} f6 {?! Interesting ... I think Black wanted to free his Q from the duty of defending the Rd8, while also preparing ...g5 attacking my Q, but this weakens the kingside pawns and White will be able to safely ignore the pawn attack because of the pin on the g-file.} 33. Rg4 {Now I pin Black's N against his R and prepare doubling my rooks on the g-file.  At last I felt my attack was coming together.} Ng5 {The pin on the N was not effective, since, after 34. Rxc4? dxc4 35. Qxc4 Qxd3! The N now obstructs the g-file and threatens a fork from f3 if I try Rg1.  Also, Black threatens to swap on g4.} 34. f4 {I throw my weakling f-pawn into the fray, to reopen the g-file and remove the threats of Rxg4 and Nf3 with a fork.} Ne4 {Black returns his N to its lovely outpost but now I can double rooks with impunity.} 35. Rcg1 {My first real threat.} Rd7 {Black defends along the seventh rank.} 36. Qh5 {! A dual purpose move, threatening to attack down the h-file and also to check from e8, when, if Black interposed his Q on f8, the Rd7 would hang loose.  If Black moved the King instead, Rh4 would deliver mate.} g5 {Supported by the pawn on f6 and the N on e4, this pawn appears to obstruct the battery on the g-file, while giving the King breathing space but I could now see definite mating potential on the h-file.} 37. Rh4 {! Exploiting the pin from g1, I prepare either 38. Qh8+ or 38. Qe8+ or 38. Qg6+, depending on Black's reply.} Rg7 {Allows the winning combination but I'm not sure what else Black could have done.} 38. Qe8+ {Now, I couldn't see a mate but I could see an opportunity to win Q for R with a winning game.} Qf8 {Forced.} 39. Rh8+ Kxh8 {Forced.} 40. Qxf8+ {For the first time in the game, I'm materially ahead but the game still has to be won, as Black's pawns and N are quite formidable, especially if he can coordinate his rooks effectively.} Kh7 {Forced (40. ...Rg8 41. Qh6#)} 41. h4 {Once again, I needed to open a line for my remaining rook.} Rcc7 42. hxg5 fxg5 43. Rg2 Rcf7 {This looks as if it may force my Q to retreat to b4, when it would be relatively harmless but ...} 44. Rh2+ Kg6 {Forced.} 45. Ne5+ {and Black resigned, as the Rf7 falls as well.  Having, at times, been 20 minutes behind, I was now also ahead on the clock, with 27 minutes left to my opponent's 21.}
