1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Bf5 3. c4 {The game has become a variant of the Queen's Gambit Declined.} c6 {The Slav defence.} 4. Qb3 Qc8 {Lasker played absolutely awful in this game. The right move was 4...Qb6.} 5. cxd5 cxd5 6. Nc3 {Already White's attack looks menacing. He has 3 active pieces to Black's one.} e6 7. Bf4 a6 8. Na4 Ra7 {If this were a game between 2 evenly matched players, Black would probably resign here. But Lasker, Champion of the World at the time this match was played, is hoping his amateur opponent will blunder.} 9. Nb6 Qd8 10. Bxb8 Qxb8 {Black is horribly underdeveloped and his King is exposed. Even the great ones have off days.} 11. Qa4+ Ke7 {The beginning of the end. The King-hunt now starts in earnest.} 12. Rc1 {The 4th piece comes into the attack, and it's just a matter of moves.} g5 13. Ne5 Nh6 {If 13...Nf6, 14 Nc8+ Kd8 15 Nxf7#.} 14. Nc8+ {The final blow. Lasker resigns. If 14...Kd8, 15 Qd7#. if 14...Kf6, 15 Nd7+ forks King and Queen.}
