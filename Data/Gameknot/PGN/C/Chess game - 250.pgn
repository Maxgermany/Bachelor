1. e4 {This game was played in the Derbyshire League with me as white. I was playing a much stronger player and blundered fairly early, but managed to come back through the use of a head on attack.} c5 {So far nothing unusual.} 2. f4 {Ah, I'm playing that.} d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4. Nc3 Nxd5 5. Nxd5 Qxd5 6. Nf3 Qe4+ {What's he up too...?} 7. Be2 Qxf4 {Greedy...} 8. O-O e6 {What should I threaten him with?} 9. d3 Qc7 10. Ng5 f6 11. Ne4 {I think that's a good place for a knight, so far 1 pawn down but decent development.} Be7 12. Bh5+ g6 13. Nxf6+ {I didn't think this through...} Bxf6 14. Rxf6 Qe5 {Oops...} 15. Qf1 Qxh5 16. Bf4 Nc6 17. Bd6 {Trying to hit a weak point.} Qh6 18. Re1 {When in doubt, strike down the middle.} Bd7 19. Rfxe6+ {Fighting Back.} Kd8 {Taking it is asking for trouble} 20. Qf6+ {But I don't mind this way either} Kc8 21. Qxh8+ Nd8 22. Be7 {Threatening mate and ganging up on the knight.} Kc7 {The only move.} 23. Qe5+ Kc8 24. Bxd8 Kxd8 25. Re8+ {To win the bishop.} Bxe8 26. Qxe8+ Kc7 27. Qxa8 Qd2 28. Qe8 {Bring my Queen back into play. Now to trade Queens.} Qxc2 29. Qe5+ Kb6 30. d4 {Go on, take b2} cxd4 {Didn't think it would work} 31. Qxd4+ Ka6 32. Qe3 {If I can trade Queens, I'm fine to lose a pawn.} Qc7 {Hence the running off. Never mind, I've got an idea.} 33. Qa3+ Kb5 34. Qb3+ Ka6 {Trying to keep the Queen on.} 35. Qa4+ Kb6 36. Re6+ {Forcing the King onto the C-rank} Kc5 37. Qc2+ {He resigned here, I wonder why...}
