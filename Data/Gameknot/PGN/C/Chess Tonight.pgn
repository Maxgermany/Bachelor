1. d4 {Queen's Pawn Opening} d5 {Queen's Pawn Game} 2. b3 {Preparing to fiancetto at b3? If so that bishop would be at least temporarily defensive, covering the d4 pawn, and also being covered by it, until it moves or is captured.} Bf5 {Developing the bishop. Influencing the center e4 square and also the c2 square where a pawn, only protected by the queen resides. In this situation it might be helpful to keep an eye out for possibilities of 1) attacking the queen in such a way that it has to move off the line of defense to avoid capture, 2) capturing a piece that the queen protects so that it has to move off the line of defense to recapture such as capturing the d4 pawn with a pawn so that the queen will have to recapture (at least until the white knight goes to c3 where it can then be the piece to recapture), or 3) attacking the pawn that the queen protects with two different weaker pieces so that the queen would not be willing to recapture and then be recaptured itself, the bishop is already one such piece, the knight could be the second by way of Nc6, which then makes possible either Nb4 or Nxd4, both which would then attack c2.} 3. h3 {The only reason why I can see this move making sense is if white is hoping to run off the bishop with g4 or at least for some reason wants to keep the bishop off g4.} Nc6 {Attacking d4, influencing e6} 4. Nc3 {Attacking d5 and influencing e4.} Nxd4 {Whoops! Well you got a pawn and are now attacking c2 as discussed earlier, however...} 5. Qxd4 {Now you're down.} e6 {Notice how even though your d5 pawn was being attacked by two pieces. protecting with e6 guards against them both since neither of the attacking pieces would be willing to exchange itself for a pawn. Sometimes this handy way of protecting a pawn that has already moved two spaces can cause problems by blocking a bishop in, but since your light squared bishop is already at f5, this does not occur here. Your bishop is said to be "good," a technical term which means that it is currently outside the pawn chain. Be on alert that the bishop only has one square,g6, to flee to if it is attacked by a pawn at g4.} 6. g4 {White was probably thinking of forcing your bishop to g6 where it would no longer have any safe spaces to flee to. in two moves, white could attack the bishop with a pawn at h5 where the bishop would then have to fall. Unfortunately, and as you noticed, white had moved it's only protector of the c2 pawn is now said to be "hanging," that is, it is being attacked with no protection.} Bxc2 {Well at least now you're only down a pawn. If you could magically replace your bishop with a different piece, which would you want it to be? Hint: think of a forking double attack.}
