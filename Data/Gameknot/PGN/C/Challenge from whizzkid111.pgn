1. e4 {Where did I go wrong? Here I am losing to a talented youngster. Black sacrifices a pawn soon after the opening. In a queen-less middle game it looks like black has not enough for the pawn. Yet gradually he out-plays white. The computer analysis by Gameknot also shows white having an advantage and it gradually slipping to black. Yet the computer makes no suggestions for improvements for white. So where did white go wrong? Is the claim that white was better faulty? Play it through with me dear reader, and see if you can solve my mystery, or, if you prefer, just enjoy a good game!} c5 {I had played him with 1. d4, so I switched to 1. e4, for a bit of variety.} 2. Nf3 {So we find ourselves in the Sicilian Defence} d6 3. d4 {I play the open variation, the most common.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {This is all standard stuff. Black now has a6 with the Najdorf variation, or Nc6 going back to the main line, or what he plays, the Dragon variation.} g6 {I remember reading, as a teenager, Game 2 of Bobby Fischer's 60 Memorable Games, "Slaying the Dragon". I decide to use the same set up as white, the Yugoslav Attack.} 6. Be3 {If black plays Ng4 now, white has a nasty check on b5} Bg7 7. f3 {and now f3 is played to prevent Ng4. 7. Be2, the Classical variation is also playable.} Nc6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 {Both sides continue their development. 9 Bc4 also prevents the liberating d5 thrust by black, and its influence on the a2-g8 diagonal can be powerful.} Bd7 10. O-O-O {and so the die is cast, white will normally throw forward his kingside pawns, and play moves like Bh6, and, as Fischer says, sac, sac, mate. However even Fischer lost one game with this variation, against C Munoz (Ecuador) in the Leipzig Olympiad, October 18, 1960. See "How to beat Bobby Fischer" by Edmar Mednis.} Qa5 {This is part of a standard proceedure by black. The rook is coming from f8 to c8 and so if white plays Bh6, black is not forced to exchange the valuable black square bishop, which is a key defender of the black king. Furthermore the black queen on a5 and rook on c8 can start to pile up the pressure on the white king. Black can sometimes sacrifice on c3.} 11. Bb3 Rfc8 {All according to plan.} 12. h4 Ne5 13. Kb1 {According to the Gameknot computer, all this is "book". } b5 {This is an interesting move. It is not original, it is in the Gameknot opening database. However the gameknot computer claims it is a mistake. It suggests Nc4 13. Bxc4, as equal, which is the main line, and gives b5 13. Ncxb5 Qxd2 14. Bxd2 Nc4 15. Nc3 Nxe4 16. Nxe4 Bxd4 17. Bg5 Be5 18. Bxc4 Rxc4 19. Bxe7 as leading to a better position for white. However I think it is quite sensible for black to sacrifice a pawn to distract white from the king side attack.  } 14. Ncxb5 Qxd2 15. Rxd2 {The Gameknot computer puts white 0.69 ahead here.} Rab8 16. a4 {We are still in the Gameknot opening database here} a6 17. Na3 {The Gameknot computer puts white as 0.86 ahead here} Be8 {We are still in the opening database. Here there are 5 games with Ne2, both of which were white wins, and 7 with 18. Ka2, with 4 white wins and 3 black wins. Perhaps I should have played Ne2 instead of Ka2. What do you think dear reader?} 18. Ka2 h5 {There is just one game on the database with this move, Bollore Jacques (2184) vs. Rihouay Clement (2116), a black win! So I had to improve on this.} 19. c3 {Computer still puts white 0.72 ahead here. This is where I left the opening database, 19. Ne2 was played in Bollore Jacques (2184) vs. Rihouay Clement (2116).} Nfd7 20. Bg5 {I thought I had pressure on the black position here - my bishops look strong. Computer puts me 0.54 up} Kf8 21. Bd1 {Perhaps this was the mistake allowing the black knight in at c5. What do you think dear reader?} Nc5 22. b3 f6 {Computer now puts black 0.15 ahead} 23. Be3 Bf7 {0.61 ahead now} 24. c4 Ned3 25. Ne2 {White begins to suffer from the invasion of the black cavalry!} Nb4+ 26. Ka1 f5+ 27. e5 {and so black gets the pawn back} Bxe5+ 28. Bd4 Nbd3 29. Ka2 Bxd4 30. Nxd4 e5 31. Ne2 Nf2 32. Rf1 Nxd1 33. Rfxd1 Rxb3 34. Rd2xd6 {White has at least got rid of one of the black knights. Although material is even, the computer puts black 2.33 ahead} Ke7 {I now try an interesting and unusual rook exchange} 35. Rd6d7+ Nxd7 36. Kxb3 Nb6 {now, rather than have all my pieces in defensive positions, I let the c pawn go} 37. Nc3 Nxc4 38. Nxc4 Bxc4+ 39. Kb4 {Interestingly, the computer "only" puts black 1.67 ahead here. The black bishop is better than the white knight, in the open board, and black is a whole, clear pawn up too. What more could a player want?} Be6 {with the threat of Rc4 check, which white parries, with another exchange} 40. Nd5+ Bxd5 41. Rxd5 Ke6 {one of white's problems now is the white king is cut off from the king side, where black as the extra pawn. Now 42. Rc5 just leads to a lost pawn ending.} 42. Rd1 e4 43. fxe4 fxe4 {White could reasonably resign here.} 44. Ka5 Rc6 45. g3 Ke5 46. Re1 Kd4 47. Rd1+ Ke3 48. Rf1 Ke2 49. Rf8 e3 {Computer assesses this position as plus 5.15 for black, and I have to agree. Anyway, I resigned here.}
