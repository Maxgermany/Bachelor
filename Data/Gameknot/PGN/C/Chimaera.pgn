[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange, Romanovsky variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Black's most popular response to White's Ruy Lopez; it's popularity probably due to its proven soundness.  } 4. Bxc6 {A major parting of ways for White.  The exchange doubles a pair of Black's Q-side pawns, potentially laming his majority on that side of the board, but at the cost of ceding the bishop pair on a fairly open board.  The jury is still out on the value of this exchange.} dxc6 {By far the usual move, but by no means is the alternate capture unplayable.  After 4...bxc6 5.Nxe5 has its risks: 5...Qg5 6.d4 Qxg2 7.Qf3 Qxf3 8.Nxf3 d6 and Black has a reasonable game.  The reason for the popularity of the text move is that after 5.Nxe5 Qd4 more simply recovers the pawn.} 5. Nc3 {Also playable here are 5.d3 and 5.0-0.} f6 {Probably the "Main" line.  5...Qd6 gets played often, and I have played the highly aggressive but dubiously sound 5...Bg4 on GK.} 6. Nxe5 {(?) Bold ... and bad.  But maybe there's more to it than meets the eye.  White gets a couple of pawns for the piece, but his immediate attack is swiftly repulsed...} fxe5 7. Qh5+ Kd7 {(!) Obviously best.  The alternatives allow White to keep his attack going a little longer: 7...Ke7? 8.Qxe5 ; 7...g6?? 8.Qxe5 )} 8. Qxe5 Qf6 {(!)  Just the right moment to offer to exchange queens.  White has only a narrow range of options.  Material down, he doesn't want to exchange and so diminish any attacking chances he might obtain.} 9. Qg3 {The alternatives are no better, but this allows Black to develop a piece with tempo.} Bd6 10. Qd3 Ke8 {(!)  Not bad: to free up the c8-B, but also leaving free the d-file for the a8-R.} 11. Qc4 {(?!) To get off the d-file, to inhibit Black's b-pawn from moving,  to prevent 11...Bc5, or to free up the d-pawn?  Or all of the above?  Whatever: Black again develops with gain of tempo.} Be6 {...Natch!} 12. Qe2 Ne7 13. O-O {13.d3 was also playable.} Rf8 {(!?) This move is fine, but I might have been inclined to try 13...Kd7 with the view to swinging the a8-R over to the K-side - ...Rg8, say.  Along completely different lines, 13...b5 is another idea, threatening to dislocate the c3-N.} 14. d3 Ng6 15. a3 {(?) Takes from Black's DSB a square it doesn't want to reach.  Instead 15.Be3 seems to be called for.} Qh4 {(!?) Black launches her K-side attack with an immediate strike at h2.  Yet maybe she let her best chance slip right here.  I like the look of 15...Nf4(!) 16.Bxf4 Qxf4 17.g3 Qg4 18.Qxg4 (or 18.Qe3 Rf3; or 18.Qd2 Qf3) 18...Bxg4 19.f4 Bh3.  With the queens gone, White's array of pawns will be a very problematical match for Black's bishop pair (and extra piece).} 16. g3 Qh3 17. f4 {(!?) Good, though 17.Be3 first might have been even better.} Bc5+ {(?!) An attractive idea, but maybe too straightforward an approach.  Black has several possible ways to attack, and it is not easy in such circumstances to find the likeliest to break through.  A better alternative seems 17...Bg4! 18.Qf2 (covers the g1-a7 diagonal) 18...Ne5! (exploits the momentary pin on the f-file to bring the N into action) 19.Be3 (say) 19...Nf3  20.Kh1 Rf6 with an attack.  After 21.Qg2 Black can go all out: 21...Rh6! 22.Qxh3 Rxh3 23.Rf2 g5 ... You don't often see such ferocious looking attacks with the queens absent!} 18. Be3 Bxe3+ {(?!) Still preferable seems 18...Bg4, hoping for 19.Qf2? Rxf4!  Of course, White will play 19.Qd2, whereat Black can no little better than retire the c5-B to e7.  Note that I mentioned Black (in this instance) "hoping for" this or that response.  This is fine if you have already planned a good followup to your opponent making a different and better move.  Where it becomes Heisman's "Hope Chess" is when you have no such followup planned ahead of time.} 19. Qxe3 Bg4 {(!?) Was it already time for Black to cut and run?  19...Qh6 would allow Black to take a breather.} 20. Rf2 {(?!) Here 20.f5! would probably have given White at least an even game. That central pawn phalanx, it seems to me, would be well worth a piece once  Black's Q and B are left stranded behind enemy lines with no clear means of extraction.  Now, however, Black gets a second chance...} b6 {(?!) But it's psychologically difficult to recognise that it is time to cut one's losses.  This move maybe keeps the WQ out of c5, and plans ...c5 shortly.  But Black hasn't time for this.  20...Qh6 was still indicated.  Note that it momentarily stops 21.f5 owing to the pin along the Queen's diagonal. } 21. f5 {(!) Fine move.  Black's B and Q are cut off from the main army.  } Ne5 {(!?) Probably Black's best chance.  21...Ne7 22.Qg5 Rf7? 23.Rf4! h5 24.Nd1 Bxd1 (essential: 25.Nf2 was threatened) 25.Rxd1 and the only way to save the WQ is by 25...Nxf5.  Instead of 22...Rf7, 22...Qh5 is an improvement, but White must have the edge after 23.Qxg7. } 22. Raf1 {(?!) Too slow, maybe?  More incisive is 22.Qf4 Nd7 23.Qxc7.   Black can improve by fighting her way clear by giving up 2 minor pieces for a rook: 22.Qf4 Nf3 !? 23.Rxf3 Bxf3  24.Qxf3 Kf7 with the view to ...Kg8 and a measure of safety.  At two pawns down for the exchange, Black would still have a fighting chance to save the game.} Rd8 {(!?) Black could also have tried once more to cut and run: 22...Qh6 23.Qxh6 gxh6.  But it doesn't look very enticing.  But now White has another opportunity to assert his dominance.} 23. Ne2 {(?) But not this way.  With 23.Qf4 Nd7 24.Qxc7 Qh6 25.e5 White would have had a strong attack.  After the game move Black could have turned the game back to around about evens once more.} Bxe2 {(!) } 24. Qxe2 Ng4 {(?!) Insisting on attack.  Instead 24...Qh6 and Black ought to be able to consolidate a defence (e.g. ...c5 to maintain the N on e5), after which there are prospects the extra piece will eventually come into its own.} 25. Rf2f4 h5 26. e5 {(!) Classic instance of a central counteraction against a flank operation.    White has the advantage now.} Rd7 27. e6 {(!?) Better was 27.d4, in my view: maintaining a close-order advance.} Rd5 {Obvious and, as it transpires, a good move.  It would have been much less effective had White played 27...d4.} 28. c4 Rxd3 {(??) Clever and imaginative... and wrong.  A tragedy, really.  Much better was 28...Re5! and after 29.Qd2 Ke7, Black seems to have sufficiently solid defence to hold on.  She could even try the more aggressive 29...g5!?  30.fxg6 e.p. Rxf4 31.Rxf4 Rg5 (NOT 31...Re1  32.Qxe1 Qxh2  33.Kf1 and Black runs out of attack) 32. Rf2 (say) Rxg6, with a battle still in front of both players.  White would have had no alternative to 29.Qd2, either: [A] 29.Qg2?? Qxg2 ! 30.Kxg2 Ne3  wins for Black, as does [B] 29.Qc2? Rexf5!! 30.Rxf5 Qxf1!! 31.Kxf1 (31.Rxf1 Rxf1  is simpler for Black) 31...Rxf5 !! (astonishing move!) 32.Ke1 (say) Rf1 !! 33.Kxf1 Ne3  recovers the queen and wins!  An extraordinary line: at move 32, only Kf1-e2 averts the fork, but gets the skewer ...Rf2  instead. } 29. Rxg4 {(!!) Naturally, White cannot take the rook (29.Qxd3?? Qxh2#).  After this capture, Black is quite lost, though she resists stoutly for several moves.} Rb3 30. Rh4 Rxg3+ {(!) A clever response, but it just isn't enough in the face of those advanced centre pawns.} 31. hxg3 Qxg3+ 32. Qg2 Qxh4 33. Qg6+ {(?!) Good enough to win, but White could have closed it out right here with 33.Qxc6  and mate in three: 33...Ke7 34.f6 ! Rxf6 35.Qd7  Kf8 36.Qd8#} Kd8 {Not 33...Ke7 34.Qxg7  Kd6 35.Rd1  Kc5 36.Qe7  (or Qxf8 ) Kxc4 37.Qb4#} 34. Qxg7 Qg4+ {The only chance, slender though it is.} 35. Qxg4 hxg4 36. f6 Ke8 37. Kg2 Rh8 38. Rd1 {38.Rh1 was as good.  } b5 {Had Black played 38...Rf8 then 39.f7  Ke7 40.Re1 would have bailed up Black's K and R, allowing the WK to snaffle the g-pawn and then reinforce the advanced pawns.  But this move shortens the game...} 39. Rd7 {(1-0) There's nothing to be done about 40.f7 .  Interesting struggle throughout this game.  There's only one thing harder than winning a "won" game.  That's winning a lost one.}
