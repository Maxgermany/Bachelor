1. Nf3 {a reasonably common opening.} d6 2. Nc3 Bg4 3. e3 a6 {to prevent Bb5 so as to avoid any or all kind of pins that may develop later.} 4. d3 Nf6 5. Be2 {?  i feel e4 would be better - pawns occupying the center and releasing the black bishop.} h6 {again to avoid another pin.} 6. Bd2 c6 7. Nd4 Bxe2 8. Qxe2 e6 {to prevent Nf5 which threatens pawn on g7 and destroys king-side defense.} 9. e4 {finally!!} c5 10. Nf3 e5 {my own advance of pawns!!} 11. g3 Nc6 {i plan to place the knight on d4 - giving the queen a little trouble. } 12. Be3 {that stops the attack!} Be7 13. Ng1 {???} Qd7 14. f4 {wasting a move to take a knight back just for a pawn exchange is a bad move here for 2 reasons: 1. it gives black (me) an extra move. 2.the pawn exchange brings the e3 bishop to f4 - thereby wasting the purpose for which the bishop was brought to e3 } exf4 15. Bxf4 Nd4 16. Qd2 b5 17. Be3 Qg4 {now my attack begins.....} 18. Bxd4 cxd4 19. Nce2 O-O {first keep the king safe before you attack!!!} 20. Nxd4 Nxe4 {!! if white captures Ne4, 21. .... Qxe4(check) - rook on h1 is lost.} 21. Qe3 Nf6 {!! if white takes bishop on e7, 22. ..... Re8 - the white queen is lost.} 22. Kd2 {??????????????????????? a big big big mistake....u don't line queen and king on a black diagonal when the opponent has a supported black bishop!!!} Nd5 23. Qf3 {???? removes support for Nd4 - it is lost.} Qxd4 24. c3 Bg5+ 25. Kc2 Ne3+ 26. Kc1 {?? probably d2 was better.} Qxd3 27. Qe2 Nd1+ 28. Qd2 Qxd2+ 29. Kb1 Qxb2# {}
