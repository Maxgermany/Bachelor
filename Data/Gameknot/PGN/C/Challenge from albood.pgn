1. c4 {Cat On A Hot Tin Roof....  With an opponent better than I, despite the relatively small difference in ratings, a very morale boosting win!} e5 2. b3 Bc5 {You can play silly whatsits with your pawns, I'm going to plough on regardless. Seriously though I do have rather large holes in my opening theory. So I develop as best as I can.} 3. Bb2 d6 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Na4 Bb6 6. Nxb6 axb6 {Purists might think that was a mistake, moving the bishop, but I've had a few games where my opponent has done so and exploited the open rook file rather nicely. } 7. e3 Be6 8. Bc3 f5 {Allowing k-f6 without blocking the pawn.} 9. Ne2 Nf6 10. Ng3 g5 11. Be2 h5 {At this point I'm quite happy. Pawn charge time, good support behind....} 12. O-O h4 {Now I see a chance to force the knight back, expecting k-a1, but I missed a trick....} 13. Nh5 g4 {Thought about kxk, but decided to block off the bishop first.} 14. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {Fine and dandy yes, all expected.....} 15. f4 {Ah phooey. Thought about the en passant, but decided against it as it largely hands the f file to white and breaks up that nice pawn charge. Almost made the catastrophic error of e4, realising just in time what a horrendous idea that was.} Rg8 {In the end, rather flummoxed a bad move results. this was to protect g4 if the pxp, pxp, bxp line was followed. But I couldn't take the bishop anyway as its protected by the queen and if I countertake with the pawn then rxq. So an attempt at a def move which failed miserably.} 16. d4 {Again tempting to push the e pawn, which on hidsight might have been ok. I just had visions of white playing d5, forgetting I'd have his dark squared bishop as compensation.} Bd7 17. b4 {Now white is having a pawn charge of his own.} exd4 18. exd4 Qe6 {Gets rid of the potential pin and I can cope with the expected d5 reply.} 19. d5 Qe3+ {I'd expected that one and had the response ready.} 20. Kh1 Qxc3 21. dxc6 Bxc6 22. b5 Bd7 23. Qd5 O-O-O {Very conveniently able to castle and protect both sides.} 24. a4 Qf6 {In preparation for c6.} 25. a5 c6 26. Qd2 Kc7 {Trying to unpark the pawns.} 27. a6 Rda8 28. a7 {Not too unhappy with that. True it pins the rook, but I can cope with that....I think.} g3 29. h3 {Trying to block this side off so I can funnel an attack through the e file.} Rge8 30. Bf3 Qe6 31. Qc3 Qe3 32. Qf6 {And that blocking worked soooo well..} Qe7 33. Qb2 Qe3 34. Rfe1 Qxf4 35. Rxe8 {Quite fortunate in the placing of my pieces here, more luck than judgement.} Bxe8 36. Qh8 Qg5 37. bxc6 {I'd expected r-e1, which would have caused me some disquiet.} bxc6 38. Qh7+ Bd7 {Back in my hedgehog with my rook clear, quite content with that. I think checking me there was a mistake as it allows me to withdraw in safety.} 39. Qf7 Qe3 40. Qh7 Qd4 {Still pawn snaffling to be honest and protecting my pawns, didnt for one moment think I'd be allowed the rook ;-)} 41. c5 {I looked very closely for the trap here. The third game against this opponent and I've learnt painfully how good he is.} Qxa1+ {And at that point whites choices are somewhat restricted.}
