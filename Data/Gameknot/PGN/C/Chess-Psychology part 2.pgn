1. e4 {The whole game here seems to have been a psychological battle of fear and misconceptions rather than on caluclations and motifs. It is the perfect example for psychology.@jkarp: Thank you very much for your input. This annotation is for intruction to weaker players primarily, and I will have used your feedback to improve this annotation. I hope you and others enjoy it.} c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 e6 4. Nf3 Nge7 5. Bb5 {Part of my opening preparation. Why would one choose to hit those redundant knights with the bishop? Reason is to trade, then close the position to try favoring my knights. @jkarp: You are correct in that knights are -generally- better than bishops in closed positions. However, there is no such rule in chess. When you evaluate the quality of minor pieces, the only correct way is by concrete comparison: Which piece is better based on concrete variations. } d5 6. exd5 Nxd5 {(!?)An extremely interesting try in this position. The normal move is the pawn recapture. The knight retake looks, on first sight, ridiculous since it allows my bishop to take and double the black pawns. However, it contains a drop of poison, since it attacks f4 and black can add pressure to the target. Here I felt quite scared, because now I thought that it was I who had stumbled into opening preparation, and I truly had little idea of how to proceed.} 7. Bxc6+ {The natural move, but not best. 7.0-0! is good, with an edge to white. Mrs.Pogonina is a friend of my coach, and she is a very strong player. That is correct, castling must be made carefully. Here however, one can rest assured that it is the best move. I guess you wanted some variations. With rybka or Shredder UCI, I was able to deduce this as the best move however. The variations are quite complex.} bxc6 8. d3 Bd6 {Now I was faced with a critical decision here: How to protect the pawn. It cannot move up safely, because the sacrifice is not exactly sound. Protecting it many times will just lead to my pieces being tied down to it. The move g3? is bad, because it weakens the Kingside light squares. Here, we get on with our first misconception, and it is even sometimes seen in players much stronger than me, like at the 2300+ level.} 9. O-O {(!)The best move, and it could only have been made with the important psychological principle(that was unknown to me during the game): __Material is just another positional factor/imbalance in any position__Most class players seem to value material far too much, and will only give it up in the hopes of a direct attack against the opponent's king, or a huge positional advantage that is clearly obvious to favor the side down material. However, treat material like a positional factor in a position, like activity, structure, better minor pieces etc.. A 2300 player, in a game once failed to sacrifice his queen for 2 bishops but large counterplay and stuck to his passive defense and lost quickly. I have won the psychological battle against material overestimation here. Unfortunately, my opponent fights his own battle against "chess fear".} O-O {Although castling is prudent, and a good move as well, I'm not sure my opponent seriously considered taking the pawn, since he moved quickly. Although 9...Nxf4 10.Ne5? Bxe5 11.Bxf4 Qd4+ gives black a clear advantage, I had prepared a pawn sacrifice with 9...Nxf4 10.Ne4! with full compensation. Another line is 9...Bxf4?! 10.Bxf4 Nxf4 11.Qd2 Ng6 12.Qe3 is good or slightly better for white. @jkarp and others: Please read my annotations. I know that they may be tedious, but they will help you get rid of bad thought process. I gave variations here justifying the pawn sacrifice. Yes, he can win a "point"(Pawn is more accurate, since counting points in positions doesn't mean much usually), but remember again: MATERIAL IS JUST ANOTHER POSITIONAL IMBALANCE. If you lose a game, something in the position must have been bad for you, whether it was doubled pawns or something else. The point is that, in my variations, I get adequete development and activity to offset this imbalance. The point: If you treat material as different and worth more than the other positional considerations, then you will always be timid to the strong sacrifices. Material is important, but activity is just as important. Instead of tying down my pieces and weakening their activity, I strengthen my own pieces and increase the activity, all for a pawn. It is a sound sacrifice.} 10. Ne5 Nxc3 11. bxc3 Bxe5 {(?)Now my opponent is making a fundamental error. He makes 2 exchanges of his most active pieces, and leaves white with a kingside advantage with opposite color bishops, and no piece protection for the king. This also frees my dark squared bishop immediately. Ridiculous move, but it shows my opponent being afraid of ghosts and "exchanging to draw". That leaves another principle: Exchanges do not necessarily clarify the position at all. When you make an exchange, you are making a critical decision that may alter the position drastically. Once again, please remember that because material is even, does not mean the position is close to it. In fact, here, white has a major advantage worth just as much or even more than a pawn, since he will soon have a powerful attack.} 12. fxe5 Qd5 13. Bf4 {(?)Now this is a concrete mistake that seriously hampers my attack. If I were to be given this position now, I would have chosen 13.Qe1! in seconds. Unfortunately, my inexperience at the time led me to make the best looking move: The Bf4 develops and looks good, while the queen to e1 looks strange at best, and moves the queen before completing development. This brings up rule #3: The power/quality of your move depends only on your opponent's possible responses to it and the positions those lead to. Qe1 would eliminate counterplay at once, while this move gives black a chance at survival.} c4 14. d4 Rd8 15. Qg4 {.} Bb7 16. Rf3 Qe4 17. Rg3 g6 18. Rf1 c5 {.} 19. Qh3 {(?)A mistake. It is too slow. White should have transformed his advantage with 19.Bh6, with a clearly advantageous endgame. But black, on the defensive, continues passively, and does not counterplay. @jkarp: The reason that Bh6 is the best move is because there is no good way to continue the attack because black will simply defend. There is nothing close to mate because black easily defends. If you give white some free moves, OF COURSE he will be able to mate. What opponent would allow that? In the start of a chess game, if you give the opponent some free moves, he will able to capture many of your pieces, but you dont allow that.} Qf5 {(?)} 20. Qh4 Kf8 21. Qxh7 Qxc2 22. Qh8+ Ke7 23. Qf6+ Ke8 24. Bg5 {The game is over. You have learned of some important (3) rules in this game. Applying these into your thought process wioll improve you a lot, because these are 3 huge and common mistkaes by even strong players. @jkarp: After looking at your thought process, I believe that the way for you to improve is the following: 1.Do not think so much about the principles and general rules in chess as much as the concrete analysis. This is the 3rd most common mistake by club players: They judge the quality of moves by using principles and general rules. Principles are only for selecting candidate ideas and tiebreaks in case you analysed 2 moves, and they are equal. Objectivity is the key.  2.Remember the rule: A move, no matter how good it looks, is only good or bad based on the opponent's answer(s) to it. 3.If you can use these ideas in your though process, your performance will soar. Thanks.}
