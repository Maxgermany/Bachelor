1. d4 d5 2. e3 Bf5 {White has prepared c4, by playing e3 first: not only a loss of tempo, but also blocking Bc1; that is why I always play Bc8 first...} 3. Bd3 Bg6 {after Bxg6, always hxg6, opening up the h-file...} 4. f4 e6 {Black was going to play e6 anyway: also releasing Bf8...} 5. Nf3 h6 {take out Ng5...} 6. O-O Bd6 7. Ne5 Bxe5 8. fxe5 Ne7 9. c3 {White could make it more difficult for Black with Bxg6, fxg6, prohibiting castling short for a while longer: this move is weak; why not c4?} O-O 10. e4 a6 11. exd5 Nxd5 12. Bxg6 fxg6 13. Qg4 {attacking e6 and g6: but there is hardly a problem for Black...} Rxf1+ 14. Kxf1 Qf8+ 15. Kg1 Qf5 16. Qxf5 gxf5 17. c4 Nb4 {getting himself in trouble...} 18. Na3 Nd3 19. Rb1 Nc6 20. Nc2 b5 21. b3 Rd8 22. cxb5 axb5 23. Ba3 {White has to give up the center, before things get out of hand...} Nxd4 24. Nxd4 Rxd4 25. Rd1 Rd5 26. Kf1 c5 {just in time, Black closes all gaps...} 27. Rxd3 Rxd3 28. Bxc5 Rd1+ 29. Ke2 Ra1 30. a4 bxa4 31. bxa4 {White might have tried b4: but the Black pawn is too dangerous...} Rxa4 32. Kf3 g5 {the rest, is a matter of technique...} 33. h3 Kf7 34. Bd6 Kg6 35. g3 g4+ 36. hxg4 fxg4+ 37. Ke3 Kf5 38. Kf2 Ke4 {Black is rapidly developing mating potential...} 39. Ke2 Ra2+ 40. Kf1 Kf3 {g3 will fall: it is over; White resigned...}
