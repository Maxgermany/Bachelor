1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 {King's gambit accepted } 3. Bc4 {The bishop's gambit.   White intends for as much attack as possible. } Nc6 4. d4 {Still opening up the center; helping develop the bishop.  Better is Nf3 } Bb4+ {?? } 5. c3 {and the obvious push backwards } Bd6 6. Nf3 {Developing the knight and putting pressure on e5...also prevents Qh4  } f6 {?? a poor move...   an attempt to prevent e5 } 7. O-O {Safeguarding the king and putting the rook on the empty file for a hopeful attack.    it's funny too, i seem to mostly use castling as an attacking move in my games. "castling is an attacking move" } Na5 {Pushing the bishop off of the dangerous diaganol } 8. Bd3 g5 {an attempt to keep an attack on white, but black's pieces are poorly developed and soon exposed } 9. Nxg5 {White hopes to crush the king's side and end the game quickly } fxg5 {accepts the sacrifice } 10. Qh5+ {and white leads into the attack } Kf8 {Ke7 and white plays e5; winning the bishop } 11. e5 {white must remove the pawn duo } Be7 12. Bxf4 {white continually sacrifices pieces to keep the pressure on black and to keep the poorly placed pieces on poorly kept squares } gxf4 {and black accepts again } 13. Rxf4+ {the obvious recapture } Bf6 14. Nd2 {here white attempts to bring the knight into play and also create a battery on the f file } d5 {black tries to refute the knight, but cannot stop the following moves } 15. Rxf6+ {again } Nxf6 {with the only recapture available } 16. Rf1 {white wins back a piece and brings in more attack } Qe7 17. Rxf6+ {white wastes no time } Kg8 18. b4 {white wants to play Bc4 } Nc6 {the only square available  Nc4 loses to Nxc4 dx4 and Bxc4 ! } 19. Ne4 {again white brings more pieces into the fray.  also as previously stated, dxe4 loses to Bc4 ! } Bd7 {an attempt to allow the a rook into play and perhaps an attempt to drive back the white queen } 20. Ng5 Be8 {attempts to push back the white queen and release pressure, but it is too late } 21. Qh4 a6 {?   a6 prevents b5?   } 22. Ne6 {white puts the knight into an even more dangerous place.  with the obvious attack of Qg5  } Bg6 {the only way to prevent the attack... } 23. Qg5 {but white continues the same plan causing the bishop to be pinned.  Black also must be weary of Rxg6  } Qxe6 {black merely stalls out the game } 24. Rxe6 Rf8 {Black has no remaining hope and resigns  25. Rxg6  hxg6 26. Qxg6#  or  25. Rg6  Kf7 26. Qf6  Ke8 27. Qe6  Kd8 28. Rg7 and black loses much material and is mated soon after }
