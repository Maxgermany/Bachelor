[Black "Amateur "]
[Opening "KP (C20), Lopez opening"]

1. e4 {Morphy's favorite opening move as White.} e5 {The traditional response.} 2. c3 {A nontraditional second move, preparing for P-Q4.} Nf6 {The amateur, logically, attacks the unguarded KP.} 3. d4 {Morphy proceeds with his plan.} Nxe4 {Black goes in for the exchange of KP's...} 4. dxe5 {...and Morphy completes it.} Bc5 {Seemingly preparing to castle. However, he never does get a chance to and ends up paying the price.} 5. Qg4 {Normally a Queen move this early is bad, but this one has a disorganizing effect on Black's position. He now must move or defend his Knight, and because of White's KP, he has few options.} Nxf2 {The only safe square.} 6. Qxg7 {Again leaving Black with few viable options. } Rf8 {6... NxR 7 QxR ch K-K2, offering an exchange of Queens to break the attack, might be an alternative. I haven't analyzed the continuations. Black doesn't seem to have many good moves.} 7. Bg5 {Now Morphy attacks the trapped Q. } f6 {Black has little choice. 7... B-K2 loses the Knight on B7.} 8. exf6 {Threatening a number of nasty things. 8... NxR, freeing the B to defend the threatened K-side, may well be the best move of a bad lot for Black.} Rxf6 {Desperate, Black gives up his Rook in an attempt to break the attack.} 9. Bxf6 {Morphy's attack loses none of its force.} Be7 {The only way to stop BxQ.} 10. Qg8+ {Black resigns. 10... B-B1 [forced] allows 11 BxQ after all, leaving Morphy with a tremendous material advantage.}
