1. g3 {White wants maximum flexibility, hoping to transpose into a good varation later while avoiding immediate risk.} Nf6 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 4. c4 e5 5. Nc3 Be7 6. Bg2 c6 7. O-O O-O 8. Qc2 Re8 {Fairly standard opening play up to now. Black had several choices. The key to playing this rare and underrated Old Indian defense is patience since White often overestimates their position as compared to similar positions in the Kings Indian. This move reinforces e5 and prepares for Black to play on either side of the board. } 9. Rd1 Qc7 10. e4 {White is trying to take control of the center, and reduce Black to passivity. } b5 {Black decides on the most aggresive response, which leads to a series of tactical nuances...} 11. cxb5 cxb5 12. Qb3 {Obviously Nxb5 lost due to the pin. But now White has two pieces on the pawn...} Rb8 {Rb8! is the point. } 13. a3 Bf8 {Black prefers active play to ...a6. The idea is to put more pressure on the e4 pawn.} 14. Bg5 Qc4 {This continues the hypermodern them, the plan is for Black to get pressure on the Queenside while undermining White's central position.} 15. Qxc4 bxc4 16. Rab1 h6 {To put the question to the bishop and eliminate back rank threats.} 17. Bxf6 {White did not like the idea of retreating the bishop.} Nxf6 18. dxe5 dxe5 {Black seems to have equalized now, since Black has pressure on the b-file and the bishop pair. } 19. Ne1 {White plans to play f4 soon. Nd2 was an alternative.} Bc5 {Black wants the bishop on an active square. Black did not consider Bg4 as productive.} 20. h3 Be6 {Black feels comfortable with the position now. } 21. Kf1 {White is preparing for f4, and wants the king closer to the center} Nd7 22. f3 Rb3 23. Na4 Be7 24. Nc2 Reb8 25. f4 {Since ...Rxg3 loses after f5. Initates tactical nuances where the outcome is hard to predict since the bishop defending the pawn is threatened.} exf4 26. gxf4 Nb6 {Saves the piece. ...Nf8 was also possible but less active.} 27. Nxb6 Rb8xb6 28. f5 {Drives the bishop to the back rank, leading to further tactical complexities. Also possible was 28 Nd4, Rxb7 29 RXR, RxR 30 NxB 29 PxB, 31 Rd7...} Bc8 {The only move. White seems to have seized the initiative.} 29. Nd4 Rb3xb2 30. Rxb2 Rxb2 31. Nc6 {White threatens the pawn and the bishop, and has back rank threats if the bishop moves off the diagonal. } Kf8 {Simplest, and with some surprising sting if White takes the pawn.} 32. Nxa7 {Regains the pawn, but at a price...} Ba6 {Suddenly the passed pawn and discovered check threat becomes dangerous.} 33. Nc6 {Otherwise the Knight (or bishop) would be lost after c6 .} c3+ 34. Kg1 {To protect the bishop, but now...} c2 35. Rc1 Rb1 {White resigns. I think an instructive example of the resilience of the Old Indian defense. }
