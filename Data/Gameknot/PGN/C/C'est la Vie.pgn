1. e4 c5 {Another quick jaunt up the Fast Ladder. Only, this time my opponent removed himself from the ladder before the game concluded, so there was no upward jaunt at all. C'est la vie. My opponent's 1. e4 is met by the Sicilian Defense.} 2. Bc4 {Normally I only place annotations after my own moves (in this case, after black's moves). But since I presumed to prey upon an opponent over 600 rating points below mine, I will try to also offer advice after some of white's moves, to pay him back, as it were, with instruction I might give a student in an over-the-board meeting. So I will start with this: White plays he Bowlder Attack. I see it over and over here on GameKnot. Such a surprisingly popular,  yet inferior move. Well, maybe players tire of the old 2. Nf3. However, the Sicilian is strong enough for black without handing quick and painless equalization. I would advise any up and coming players to stick with the stronger opening lines. The GameKnot Database is an excellent guide, for starters.} e6 {2. ... e6 gives that poor white bishop nothing to do and subsequently threatens to push to d4 with gain of tempo that should handily equalize for black.} 3. Nf3 {A good strong developing move, preparing an early white castle and also contesting d4. This should have been white's 2nd move. Of note, 3. Bc4 (reversing the move order) would still be inferior since that bishop would still have nothing to do.} Nc6 4. Nc3 {Excellent. Contesting 4. ... d5 and pre-defending the pawn on e4 against the inevitable Nf6.} Nf6 5. d3 {This pawn really wants to be on d4, clearing away the black c5 pawn and gaining the upper hand in the center. The pawn on e4 is safe enough without a second defender.} d6 {However, while 5. ... d4 offered respectable chances for equalization, it does so at the cost of exchanging quite a bit of material. Given the disparity of our ratings, I decided to keep the position more complicated.} 6. O-O {Excellent. King safety is paramount, and getting a rook to e1 couldn't hurt either.} d5 {And then changed my mind. Worse, this wastes the 5. ... d6 move losing a tempo for black - so much for handy equalization.} 7. exd5 exd5 8. Bb5 {This is where this bishop almost always wants to be in the Sicilian, but without taking a rest stop on c4 along the way.} Be7 {Preparing to castle which will serve the dual purpose of getting the king off of the open e-file and of unpinning the c6 knight.} 9. Re1 {Excellent.} O-O {Hmm, development is roughly even and black has the stronger center and slightly more coordinated pieces. I might say black equalized even with the lost tempo on move 5.} 10. Bf4 Nd4 {This is probably not a good move. I was looking around and suddenly realized that I had few good moves, and white's control of the center was better than I had credited him. This breaks that up a bit, but at the cost of doubling my pawns on the d-file. I reasoned that with an open c-file, I would launch a rook fusillade at the backward white c-pawn enticing it forward to allow one of my d-pawns to exchange for it. Still, a weak plan. In retrospect, I really should have played something like 10. ... a6 followed by 11. ... b5, and then maybe developed my queen's bishop.} 11. Re5 {In game, I told white that I liked his style. A bold attacker, not unlike myself. This was completely true. However, this move is not at all a good one. Sometimes one can be too bold. The rook on e5 is an easy target, as black is about to demonstrate. Much simpler and very much stronger is 11. Nxd5 which saddles black with doubled isolated pawns on d4 and d5. Moreover, it exchanges a pair of knights - when one plays a stronger opponent, finding equitable trades is simply taking weapons out of the hands of a stronger player. If you do it enough, you could very well earn a draw; a sound strategy when outgunned. Playing to win is great, but when the field is not level, every equitable exchange brings it back to more level than it was before.} Bd6 {My opponent attacks boldly up the open file with 11. Re5?, but I'm ready to refute that and now white must give up the exchange or lose a piece.} 12. Re8 {Another bold move. Perhaps white miscalculated that black would play 12. ... Rxe8, though after 13. Bxe8 Nxe8 white is still down a piece. Maybe white overlooked the black knight on f8 entirely, expecting 13. ... Qxe8? which would allow 14. Bxd6. In any case, as played, 12. Re8? gives up a full rook (I give it only one ? since the rook was doomed to lose the exchange anyway, so really, this simply gives up a piece). The best option for the rook was to just sit where it was. In fact, 12. Nxd4 is still adquate here.} Nxe8 {Black plays the move that white seems to have neglected to consider, gaining a rook.} 13. Nxd5 {Here the white bishop on b5 is under attack and only defended by the knight on c3. Moving the knight will lose the bishop. Worse, black is threatening 13. ... Bxf4. Now that black is ahead in material, white should be avoiding exchanges. Consequently, 13. Bd2 might be white's best alternative here.} Nxb5 {White gets a pawn on d5, but gives up his bishop on b5, and loses the chance to double black's center pawns.} 14. Bxd6 {14. Bxd6?! was dubious at best. Down a rook and a bishop for a pawn, white should not be looking to make any exchanges.} Nexd6 15. h3 {Not a bad move. Black was considering 15. ... Bg4 to pin the white knight and exchange more material, and this prevents that.} Be6 16. c4 {16. c4 defends the knight, but black is willing to exchange freely now with his large material lead. 16. Ne3 was probably safest.} Bxd5 {Exchanges only solidfy black's material lead. If I get my way, I will trade off every white piece, leaving black with a knight and rook, more than enough to win.} 17. cxd5 {I was expecting white to recapture on b5, not on d5. Either way, he doubles his pawns, but they would be much safer doubled on the closed b-file with support from the a-pawn; black could not attack them with a rook on the b-file. As played, white gets a passed pawn on d5, which seems to be an advantage, but the advantage is only illusory. That pawn cannot be defended by a pawn on the e-file or c-file since there are no pawns there, and it cannot be defended by a rook because of the pawn on d3, so it cannot possibly promote and is certainly doomed to fall.} Nf5 18. Qb3 {This was a good move. Defending the advanced pawn and simultaneously attacking the black knight on b5.} Qb6 19. Ne5 {Nice plan. The fork on d7 is tempting, and it will earn back a little of that lost material. Most of the time this move would force black to defend, and indeed I spent some time considering the simple 19. ... Rad8 which prevents the fork and puts a rook on that white pawn on d5.} Nbd4 {Double queen-check. Side note: why don't we say "check" (well, something else, but like "check") when we put the enemy queen en prise? Of course, black will be quite well satisfied with trading queens, and the pawn structure of b7, b6, c5 is not even particularly weak, especially with a newly half-open a-file for black's rook. The white queen has few choices. Not c3?? and not a3?? and anything else loses the pawn on b2. Not 20. Nd7? since after 20. ... Nxb3 21. Nxb6 Nxa1 22. Nxa8 Rxa8 black will have removed all three of white's pieces, gaining a knight in the process.} 20. Qc4 {Unfortunately, 20. Qxb6 was the most solid move white had here.} Qxb2 {White gave up the pawn on b2, but it's not the pawn that black's queen wanted. Nor is it the rook she now threatens. This move is solely aimed at white's king, a horizontal attack along the 2nd rank. All black needs now is a rook on the open e-file and then, with two knights, black is in business - white won't have the material to withstand that attack.} 21. Re1 {A good choice, as good as any that were available.} Rae8 {Yes, this move traps the rook on f8 somewhat, but with a knight aimed at f7, and white's queen ready to discover an attack on f7, I felt it best to keep f7 supported.} 22. Qxc5 {Unfortunately, this loses a knight, as explained after black's move.} Ne2+ {White won a pawn (and another on h7 if he wishes, I certainly won't stand in white's way), but he loses a knight to 22. ... Ne2+!, cutting off the white knight's only defender while giving check. } 23. Kf1 {This move tries to win a knight, but white forgot about his own knight under fire from two black pieces. White's best try here might be 23. Rxe2 Qxe2 24. Nf3, only losing the exchange.} Rxe5 {Gaining another piece and supporting the doubly attacked knight on e2. Black has 4 pieces aimed at white's king and white only has two pieces with which to defend. This cannot end well for white.} 24. f4 {Oops. 24. f4??? gives up a 3-move forced mate: 24. ... Neg3+ 25. Kg1 (forced) Rxe1+ 26. Kh2 Rh1#. Not that any of the alternatives were a lot better, though perhaps 24. g3 lets white play on for maybe as many as 10 moves (more or less) from here.} Neg3+ {I announced the mate in three and played black's 24th move, and then entered the other two as conditionals, but white chose to resign instead. The game was lopsided, and I feel a little awkward for choosing an opponent over 600 rating points lower, but I see the ladder as being a mini-game of its own, with strategies to be employed, one of which is to find players as far above me as the rules allow who are both fast-moving and low-rated, assuring a quick rise up the ladder. I hope my opponent here understands and forgives the presumption.}
