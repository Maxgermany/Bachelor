1. e4 c5 {Instead of answering with a central pawn like e5 or d5, black plays c5 attacking the d square, preventing white to play d4 immediately. Off course playing 2.d4 is still possible but if I were white I would follow it up with a pawn sacrifice by playing c3. This ends up in: 1.e4-c5 2.d4-cxd4 3.c3. Black can now accept the sacrifice, but I never do, because white creates a lot more space on his queens side. It's not a disadvantage, but I prefer a more enclosed type of game and I'd rather not give away too much space from the start. As for 3.Qxd4, it's just a bad move. You do not want to expose your queen too early in the game and certainly not when the other player can develop while attacking it.} 2. Nf3 d6 {My personal favourite, however 2....-Nc6 or e6 are possible as well.  } 3. d4 {The most played move by white resulting in the Open Sicilian. } cxd4 {You can off course decline taking the pawn and follow up with 3....-Nf6. But you'll end up capturing it in the next move anyway, so just capture it at this moment.} 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Najdorf variation. My personal favourite. The idea behind a6 is that black wants to play e5 eventually, to chase the white knight off the d4 square and gain position in the centre. However playing it right of the bat, without a6 is not a good idea. White can play: 5....-e5 6.Bb5-Nbd7 7. Nf5-a6 8.Bxd7-Qxd7. With 6....-Bb7 the outcome is the same. White has a much stronger position at this point. A lot of space first of all and pieces that develop easily. In fact white only needs to castle and develop Bc1. Whereas black still needs to make space to develop his bishops. Still it's being played and I believe it's even a variation, but I don't know the name. I wouldn't recommend it though. By playing 5...-a6 black prevents in fact any piece from taking position at b5. Which is positive because Sicilian often ends up in a race between white and black. White attacking the kings side. Black attacking the queens side. 5...-a6 prepares that attack for black} 6. Bc4 {Number of choices for white here: 6.Be3 is usually followed by e5. This is the main line and the easiest for white since he only needs to get the queen out of the way to d2 to castle on the queens side. Off course he will first need to move the knight from d4 to a more passive square. The attack for white continues then by playing f3 followed by g4. I believe that when you don't play the Dragon Sicilian, you shouldn't be to afraid of the pawn storm by white on the kings side. 6. Bg5 or Bc4 is followed by e6. The only reason I can think of, is that both moves gain a certain control over d5. Bc4 directly, and Bg5 by pinning the knight. You don't want that square to be weak in the first opening moves. So you play e6 } e6 7. Bb3 {White feels b5 coming and moves his bishop out of the way. A common played move at this point. The bischop also remains it's aim at the kings side for a later attack. Trying to prevent b5 by playing a4 is not a good option, I'd say. It would result in: 7.a4-Nxe4 8.Nxe4-d5 9.bxd5-Qxd5. White has now 2 knights in the centre, but no pawns and those knights can be easily chased by playing f5 somewhere down the line. Black also has an incredible amount of space to move around.} Nbd7 {b5 is also possible at this point. But white is going to play f4 and Qf3. So you want to have played b5 and your knight to c5 by then.  White's idea is to push the pawn on the f-line further up the board. You want to be ahead of him with your pawn on the b-line. Playing Nc5 also keeps pressure on whites pawn on e4. } 8. f4 {Standard play. I wouldn't play f3 to be followed up by g4, because you're going to be late. Black will push more pieces out like Nc5 and also move up the pawn on the b-line. } Nc5 9. Qf3 b5 10. f5 b4 {Blacks pawn is obviously more threatening so the knight needs to get out of the way.} 11. Na4 {By playing Na4, I'm obligated to capture the bishop on b3. However I was going to anyway, since I would like to play e5 further down the line and I'd rather be rid of this bishop aimed at my kings side and the unprotected d5 square.} Nxb3 12. axb3 e5 {Again moving my pawn in a better position while attacking one of his pieces. He looses a tempo while I gain one by developing a piece. Remember I'm far behind due to the pawn play in the beginning of the opening. Whites pawn on e4 also becomes weak and as for my weaker pawn on d6: it is not under any attack at the moment and can be easily defended. The f5 move has opened up an extra line for an attack on my kings side. So I decided to postpone going for the castle.} 13. Ne2 Bb7 {Developing a piece and attacking the e4 square at the same time. Sometimes chess does not have to be difficult. Develop your pieces into a strong position and make your opponent loose tempos by keeping the pressure on his weaker points. If you don't see the attack immediately, position your pieces on easy defensible squares, and wait for your opponent to create the opening. Off course this is situation dependent. If you wait too long your opponent has an advantage in the end game} 14. Ng3 Qc7 {again attacking an undefended point. According to the computer analysis, I should have played: 14.Ng3-Nxe4 if white accepts the sacrifice: 15. Nxe4-Qh4+ 16.Kf1-Qxe4 gaining a pawn.} 15. c3 d5 {Prevents c5 and more importantly prevents cxb4. If played it will be followed up by Bxb4+ gaining another tempo} 16. exd5 Bxd5 17. Qe2 Bxb3 18. Bd2 {White starts to think about defending rather than attacking. Usually a good sign. Although I think white could have played this stronger.  Nevertheless. Black has a lot of advantages. Open c en d lines for the rooks. A bishop on the dark squares that can easily move around and attack the kings side. A pawn on the e line that isn't blocked by an opposing pawn. White doesn't immediately have an attack.} Nd5 {Moving my knight to a centre square and adding more pressure to the attack on c3, plus defending the pawn on b4} 19. Ne4 {Qe4 would have been better.} Qc4 {Should have played Qc6. But I was too excited about gaining the advantage that I might as well trade of the queens and head off into the mid game.} 20. Qxc4 Bxc4 21. Nac5 bxc3 22. bxc3 {Bxc3 would have been better. White does loose the bishop in exchange for a knight, but with the pawn on c3, whites bishop no longer has a line to the right side of the board (from blacks perspective) Opens up the b-line as well for my rooks further down the line.} Be7 23. Kf2 f6 {Bad move. I was afraid of castling and loosing the pawn on e5, but if I would have given this a little more thougt I would have spotted: 23. Kf2-0-0 24. Nd7-Rfe8. 25. Nxe5-Bh4+ 26. g3- Rxe5} 24. Ne6 Kf7 25. g4 {Black finds himself in a position where he has blocked himself somewhat with his king and pieces around it. And with white moving up his pawns on the board, he will soon be in a position to attack again.} Rhb8 {The idea is to start up an attack by use of the open b-line. White can play a rook to b1 for the exchange, but black will come out stronger: 26. Rhb1-Rxb1 27.Rxb1-Bd3 28.Re1- Rb8 29.Bc1 White can now only think about defending and black has an entire open a-line for the pawn to advance. } 26. Kf3 Rb2 27. h3 {According to me white is stalling here. Trying to get all his pieces out of the way of the Rook on b2.} Bd3 {attacking the only piece defending Bd2} 28. Be1 {So white moves it out of the way. Where he should have put pressure on Nd5 by playing Ra5. White never prevented me from doubling my rooks on the b-line.  And by moving the bishop to e1, I don't even need Rab8.} Re2 {Putting pressure on Ne4, which has to move since it can no longer be defended. This allows me to play e4+} 29. Ne4c5 e4+ 30. Kg3 Bd6+ {White has opened up quite some lines for me to move around and get my pieces out of their passive position. His king is forced onto the h-line. } 31. Kh4 g5+ {I should have played g6 here, but I was hoping he didn't see the mate that was coming and I got lucky.  When playing g6 you are actually preparing a mate by playing, Ne3 followed by Ng2. And there isn't much white can do about that. Except giving away more material. Possibilities are to play 32. Nb7-Be5 33.Nd8-Rxd8 34. Nxd8-Kg7 35. Bg3 (or else mate in 2 by playing g5 followed by forced Kh5 and Nf4)- g5 36. Kh5-Bxg3 It's not a done deal yet, but black controls the e1 square to promote his pawn.  Also whites rooks aren't contributing much to the game. And black can easily clean up the pawn on c3 which gives him even more advantage. Obviously white also still needs to be careful of not being mated by Nf4.} 32. fxg6 e.p.+ hxg6 {White didn't see the mate coming. Rh8 can only be delayed, not prevented.}
