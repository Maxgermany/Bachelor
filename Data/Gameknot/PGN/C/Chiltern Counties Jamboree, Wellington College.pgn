1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 {I aim for my favourite King's Indian, though I did contemplate essaying a Grunfeld.} 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e3 {Not the best response, which is 4. e4.  White adopts a standard QGD formation, which doesn't quite meet the demands of the KID.} O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. Bd3 Nc6 {If the pawn had been on e4, I'd probably have adopted John Nunn's recommended approach with ...a5 (to discourage the Bayonet Attack) and ...Na6.  With White's B on d3, I planned to meet 7. d5 with ...Nb4.} 7. a3 {White puts paid to that idea but my next move allows a more conventional response with my N.} e5 8. d5 Ne7 9. O-O Ne8 {Announcing my plan to make the classic KID ...f5 thrust, followed by a pawn storm.} 10. e4 {Necessary, but White has wasted a tempo he could ill afford.} f5 11. Nd2 {White over-defends e4, avoids potential pawn forks of d3 and f3 and prepares to meet the attack with f3.} Nf6 {Without delay, I bring the N back into the action to exert pressure on e4.} 12. Qc2 {White continues to over-defend e4, while exerting pressure on f5 and potentially preparing counter-attack on the queenside.  However, he underestimates the need to defend the kingside.} f4 {I take the opportunity to shut White's pieces out of the game to enable my g and h pawns to join in the attack.} 13. Nf3 {White rushes his N back to f3 to prevent ...g5.} Bg4 {So I prepare to swap it off.  this B usually impales itself on White's defences anyway.  Now it will get full value for its efforts.} 14. Be2 {After this, at least White will not incur doubled pawns.} Bxf3 15. Bxf3 g5 16. Qe2 {White does his best to inhibit the next advance.} a6 {Now I wanted to use my Q to support the pawns' advance with ...Qe8 but I didn't want to allow White to fork Q and R with Nc3-b5-c7, so I slotted this move in before prosecuting my attack.} 17. Bd2 {White takes the opportunity to develop his B.  With two or three more moves, he could generate some counterplay on the Queenside: eg Rc1, Na4, c5} Qe8 18. h3 {Another attempt to discourage ...g4} h5 19. Kh2 {Getting the King off the g-file but not avoiding danger ..} Qg6 {Threatening to trap the B on f3.} 20. Rfg1 {? In a difficult position, White makes things worse, cutting off his King's escape.} g4 21. hxg4 hxg4 22. g3 Qh5+ {!  A more attractive opportunity has presented itself. I'd originally planned to take the Bf3 but this forces mate: 23. Kg2 Qh3#.  Rarely has Black's pawnstorm been so effective!  A very satisfying end to my OTB season :-)}
