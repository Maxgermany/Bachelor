1. d4 {Queen's pawn game. I prefer this move myself when playing white} d5 2. c3 {A strange and slightly passive move by white here. Transposes the game into the queens pawn variation of the Saragossa Opening, a rather uncommon opening.} c5 {Black attacks whites central d pawn. } 3. Nf3 {Defending the d pawn and developing. Good move.} Nc6 {Black develops his knight as well eqalizing the fight for the center} 4. Qa4 {White violates on of the basic opening principles by moving her queen out early. There is no strategic or tactical benefit for this opening violation} Bd7 {Black takes advantage of whites dubious queen advance and sets up a discovered attack on the white queen. White should now retreat the queen with a move like Qc2} 5. e4 {e4 allows black to take advantage of the discovery on the queen...} Nxd4 {Whites response here should be Qd1} 6. Bb5 {Bb5?? Hangs the bishop by moving it right into the line of fire from both black's knight and Bishop.} Nxb5 {Here, again, a possible discovered attack on the white queen. White needs to retreat her. Qc2 here is a good move} 7. g4 {Dont have a clue what this move was really for...ignores the discovered attack that looms...} Nxc3 {Black's knight gets another "free" move and takes another pawn. The queen now under a double attack has to find a safe place to run. Qc2, once again will accomplish this.} 8. Qa5 {Ouch...hangs the white queen...} Qxa5 {white loses the queen. Black now has a discoverd check, and a threat on the previously advanced pawn on g4} 9. Nxc3 {White takes the knight, but pins her own. Black will be able to take advantage of this next move...} d4 {d4...attacks the pinned knight on c3} 10. h4 {hangs the pawn on g4} Bxg4 11. Ne5 {attacking the bishop} Nf6 {Black defends the bishop, but is eyeing the undefended pawn on e4. The pawn on e4 looks defended, but it's defender is pinned...} 12. Bg5 {attacks the knight on f6, but hangs the pawn on e4} Nxe4 {Leaves the bishop but black is a queen and 4 pawns ahead and can afford to give back a bit of material for positional play. Black now triple attacks the pinned knight on c3} 13. O-O {White finaly unpins the knight, but is a little late...} Nxc3 14. Nxg4 Ne2+ {Black needs to save his knight...} 15. Kg2 Qb6 {Really, Im just trying to get my queen to the other side of the d and c pawns, but Im doing so with threats along the way. Qb6 fits into that plan and threatens the pawn on b2 as well as a check on c6} 16. Rfe1 {attacks the knight.. } Qc6+ {Black continues his plan, with check this time...} 17. f3 {white blocks the check, but pins one of her few remaining pieces...} d3 {defends the knight and makes room for Nd4, going after that pinned pawn...} 18. Rad1 {attacks the d pawn...} c4 {defends the passed d pawn. Blacks far advance connected pawns are going to be a problem for white...} 19. b4 {Gives black another passed pawn..Thanks!!} Nd4 {eyeing the f pawn...} 20. Re3 {white sees the threat and defends...good one!} e6 {Black wants to get his last piece out. The threat now is Bxb4} 21. Rd2 {whie misses the discovered attack and hangs the pawn on b4} Bxb4 {Attacking the rook now...} 22. Rb2 Qd6 {defends the bishop and places the queen behind the passed pawn that is no unstoppable without further sacrifice from white...} 23. h5 {White is out of ideas? Nf2 can bring some help over to defend against the passer. Re4 would open the bishops defence of the d2 square...} d2 {Black takes advantage of his passed pawn. whites limited responses include Rb1 and Nf2 to attempt a stop...} 24. Re4 {gives black another queen...thanks!} d1=Q 25. Kh3 {white, possibly giving up? Moves into a mate in 2...} Qxf3+ 26. Kh4 Nf5# {}
