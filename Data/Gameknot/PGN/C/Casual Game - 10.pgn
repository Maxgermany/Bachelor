[Opening "Caro-Kann (B10), closed (Breyer) variation"]

1. e4 {Never a bad choice.} c6 {Matveeva decides against the Classical response.} 2. d3 {Very conservative. The usual reply is to advance this Pawn TWO squares and form an ideal center.} d5 {Matveeva proceeds as planned.} 3. Nd2 {Because of the timid second move, 3 N-QB3 is no longer possible, as 3... P-Q5 would drive the Knight from its post.} Nf6 {Matveeva develops the Knight to its natural square.} 4. Ngf3 {The natural post.} Bg4 {Matveeva develops aggressively, in contrast to Shafranska's overly timid approach.} 5. g3 {I'm guessing this was intended as a prelude to fianchettoing the KB. However, it weakens the pinned Knight by depriving it of Pawn protection.} dxe4 {Matveeva exploits the error by adding pressure to the helpless Knight.} 6. h3 {Counterattacking the Bishop. But....} Bxf3 {...this move now wins a piece. Shafranska resigns.}
