[Opening "Sicilian (B50)"]

1. e4 {An unrated coaching game. } c5 {The sicilian defense allows for an unbalanced position with attacking chances on both sides. The advantage of white playing first is often quickly counterbalanced.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {A rare line quite playable. d4 is the usual move.} Nf6 4. O-O {?! The chad gambit? Seems unsound but it will require good defense on black's part, like all gambits.} Nxe4 5. Re1 Nf6 6. Nc3 Bg4 7. d4 {This will create a weakness in white's structure, but white must try something to generate an attack and justify the lost pawn.} cxd4 8. Qxd4 Bxf3 9. gxf3 {The result of white's 7th move. Doubled isolated pawns, and an insecure king. But also more open lines for white's attack.} Nc6 {Black is behind in development and must undertake immediate action to get his pieces out before his king in the center becomes an easy target for white.} 10. Bb5 {Keeps the attack alive.} Qd7 {The advantage of being up on material is black can simply try exchanging pieces, especially exchanging queens to ward off the white attack.} 11. Be3 {Developing a piece, that's the good side of this move. But on the other hand blackk will exchange queens.} Nxd4 12. Bxd4 {An excellent reply involving a little trap. If now black recaptures the bishop with the queen, NxQ is hard to meet for black, because of the knight fork on c7. After O-O-O, the a pawn is lost.} a6 {The saving move.} 13. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {Black was tempted to take with the king. Dangerous because after the white rook at a1 goes to d1, white has many threats.} 14. Rad1 {Of course. White has done well in setting up his pieces for the attack and black's pieces are still underdeveloped and badly placed. And yet black can defend, but he must still be careful.} O-O-O {The move to get black out of trouble.} 15. Bb6 {A blunder. Maybe white was thinking of playing Na4 before and reversed the moves. But even then, to exchange pieces when one is behind in material is not a good idea.} Nxb6 16. Nd5 {Again, the exchange of pieces helps black.} Nxd5 17. Rxd5 e6 18. Rd3 h5 {Unusual to want to play the rook through the h file, but here it is the best way.} 19. h4 Rh6 20. Kf1 Be7 21. Re4 d5 22. Rg4 {Another blunder.} hxg4 23. fxg4 Rxh4 24. f3 Rh2 25. a4 Rdh8 26. f4 Rxc2 27. b4 {One final mistake in a lost game, to end the agony.} Rh1# {After a good strart, white made too many mistakes.}
