1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 {central game, gambit accepted} 3. c3 d5 {I'm more used to 3. ... dxc3 4. Nxc3 but this is ok for black as well} 4. exd5 {White has little choice but to trade} Qxd5 5. Nf3 {if 5. cxd4, isolated white pawn on d.} Nc6 6. cxd4 {I saw little possibilities to do otherwise.} Bb4+ 7. Nc3 {If  7. Bd2 Nxd4 and white is in serious trouble} Bg4 {Black is developping very quickly and puting pressure on white. On the other hand, black pieces are not well  protected and attack in separated order. If white holds, a strong counterattack is possible.} 8. Be2 {Defensive move and preparing the counterrattack} O-O-O 9. a3 {Now white needs to } Bxf3 {Black position is pretty dangerous : the DSB is menaced on b4, the queen is menaced on d5 (and by a different piece) and the LSB is under menace on f3. } 10. Bxf3 {White choose to eliminate the LSB first because it enables to menace the queen. Of course black can make a check but white vcan play the DSB on e3 (it's a piece which didn's move and e3 is not a bad place for it). It won't be pinned for long as white can castle short in one move.} Qe6+ {Logical} 11. Be3 {As foreseen.} Rxd4 {good move from black but the rook is under attack.} 12. Qe2 {The queen has to go.} Bxc3+ {Trading the attacked piece} 13. bxc3 Ra4 {Black has little choice, beeing obliged to let the rook on the 4th line to prevent 14. Bg4, winning the queen.} 14. O-O {It's hard time to castle. } Nf6 15. Rab1 {Now, the developpement is almost finished. White is slightly in late of material. Nobody controls the open file. No immediate threat. Both kings are safe. The center is nomansland, Black pawn structure is better because white has an isolated pawn on c file. White has a slight advantage because the two bishops, the queen are all aiming at black's kingside.  White hesitated between 15. Rd1 (controling the open file and aiming at the center) and 15. Rb1 but finally elected the last move for it strenghtens the attack on the kingside.} Qc4 {BLack proposes a queen trade, probably to weaken white's attack possibilities.} 16. Qb2 {Mate menace.} b6 {Almost forced move} 17. Be2 {Attacking the queen and menacing a fork attack between the c knight and the a rook.} Qe6 18. c4 {So that black cannot bring his isolated a rook in the center.} Ng4 {Black tries a counterattack (blunder)} 19. Qxg7 {fork attack between the g knight and the h rook.} Nxe3 {Blunder} 20. Qxh8+ Kb7 21. Rfc1 {Only square to save the rook and not being ennoyed the next move (if 21. Re1 Nc2) The other candidate move was 21. fxe3 Qxe3 + 22. Kh1 Qxe2 - white looses one pawn and has a worse position.} Rxa3 {I do not understand that move (21. ... Ra2 would have been better or 21. ... Nxg2 22. Kxg2 Qxe2  )} 22. Qb2 {To protect e2} Nxc4 {?} 23. Bxc4 {Attacking both rook and queen} Qe7 {Only move to protect both pieces} 24. Bd5 {Black submits, being unable to save the knight.}
