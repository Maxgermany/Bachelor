[Opening "QGD (D31), 3.Nc3"]

1. d4 {1.d4, my favorite first move when playing White. } d5 {So, we have what is called the closed game. Closed games consist of 1.d4 d5, along with lines that transpose into this type of position. Semi closed games are 1.d4 and black responds with anything other than 1...d5. Open games are 1.e4 e5, and semi open games are 1. e4 and black responds with anything else other than 1...e5.} 2. c4 {With this move we have the Queens Gambit (QG). Whether accepted or declined depends on you.  So in the following moves you declined the pawn. If ever you play the QG Accepted, understand the reason for accepting the pawn is not to win a pawn. You can't hold it, if your opponent knows what he is doing. The purpose in accepting the pawn is to get a semi opened d-file! In the process, you also give white a semi open c-file.   So for white to take advantage of his semi open c-file, he has to move pieces, e.g.: Qc2, and later Rc1. While for black to use the d-file, the queen is automatically there. So you save tempo. } e6 { } 3. Nc3 {So in the opening you have a constant battle to control the primary center squares, being d4, d5, e4 and e5. Whether you control them with pawns (as we did with our first moves, 1.d4 d5) or you control them with pieces (as I do with my 3rd move 3...Nc3), you must battle to control these squares! Also, to a lesser degree, the same principle goes for the secondary center squares, being c3, c4, c5, c6, d3, d6, e3, e6, f3, f4, f5 and f6. Bottom line Rick, to play well in the opening, you must be a control freak. Control those squares!  So my pawn on d4 controls e5 (and c5). My pawn on c4 controls d5 (and b5, though that's not one of the primary or secondary squares). My knight on c3 controls e4 and d5. Your pawn on d5 controls e4 (and c4). Your pawn on e6 controls d5 (and f5).  So the battle is on for the center.} b5 {3...b5(?!) I was trying to figure out why you gave me this pawn and I think you did it to draw my c4 pawn away from the center. If that was why or if it's another reason, please advise in the comments. I'd like to know.} 4. cxb5 {At any rate, I saw it as a free pawn. There are some advantages that, as valuable as they may be, are not worth as much as a pawn. I would say that my pawn being drawn away from the centre is one of them.  I am now a pawn up, a pawn which by the way, became a thorn in your side here and later in the game. The thorn begins with this pawn on b5 now hindering your queen-knight's development to c6. It went on later to become a passed pawn, which you needed to sacrifice a bishop to stop.} Nf6 {Good development to the center.} 5. Nf3 {So we both start controlling the centre with our kingside knights.} c5 {Attacking my center. You also allow me if I choose, to capture "en passant", whereby you take back with the knight, getting him developed.} 6. dxc5 {I take with my d-pawn as I did not want to help you develop your knight. This removes my central d-pawn from the board, so I needed some sort of compensation in order for me to be willing to take. In this case, I have my b5 pawn still hindering your development. I am also up a pawn.} Bxc5 { } 7. Bf4 Nbd7 { } 8. e3 { } O-O 9. Be2 Bb7 10. O-O Re8 11. Ne5 {So you've done a good job so far at keeping control of the 4 primary center squares. Because of that and your last move, 11...e5 is a real threat. So I prevent your pawn push with 11.Ne5.} Nxe5 {It's not usually in your best interest to trade when you are down material. This is because if you trade everything off equally, your opponent will still have the extra material in the end game.  In this case your only down a pawn, yet against a stronger player, a pawn is definitely sufficient to win, especially if the extra pawn is in a position to promote. In our game, you had to sac a bishop to prevent the promotion, so I will have at least a bishop lead in the endgame. Then I later promoted a pawn anyway.} 12. Bxe5 {The bishop on this diagonal is crucial for reasons I will explain in a bit.} Ne4 {More trading. } 13. Nxe4 {I'll oblige.} dxe4 { } 14. Qxd8 {Queen trading, I'm happy!} Raxd8 {Here I started focusing on how to promote the pawn. This is a little intricate. I was thinking if I get pawns on a5 & b6, you play axb6, and before I take back, I play Bc7 forking the b6 pawn and the rook. So when you move the rook, then I take the pawn back (axb6) and have an advanced passed pawn. The more advance a pawn is, the more dangerous and valuable it is. Having a well protected pawn on the sixth rank is Heaven (or Hell, if the pawn is your opponent's). I needed not only to get my pawns in position but also needed more preparation, due to you moving your rooks around. Yet in essence, that was what I managed to do.} 15. Rfd1 {So I still want to trade! If you take, you spoil the plan I just mentioned as you won't have a rook on d8 that I can fork. Yet, you also give up control of the d file and trade more material. If you don't trade I planned on taking your rook, forcing you to take back and have a rook still on d8 for me to fork. But I was still thinking way ahead, as my pawns are not even in position yet.} Bd5 {15...Bd5(!)  I had not considered this move, I must admit. You get your rook on the open file, and prevent the trade! But it does not hinder me in my plan.} 16. a4 {Gotta get the pawns in position!} Rdc8 {This threw a wrench in my plan. Now I can't fork the rook and potential b6 pawn. I had to find another way to make it work. I did not yet know what it would be.} 17. a5 {17.a5(!)  I took a little while thinking this one through! If we play 17...Red8 (the most logical looking move, to put both your rooks on the open files. It looks logical, yet it walks into my plan!) 18.b6 axb6 I can attack your rook with 19.Ba6. The only safe haven for the rook is a8 (19...Rc6 20.Bb5!). Then you have a rook on d8 for me to fork!} Red8 {Yes! You made the move!} 18. b6 {The set up!} axb6 {Knowing what I had planned, I would have suggested no taking. The pawn can't advance any further, and if I play 19.bxa7 you have Bxa7.} 19. Ba6 {19.Ba6!  I have to get you to move this rook off of the c-file. Now if Rc6, b7 trapping the rook.} Rca8 {The only square!} 20. Bc7 {Mission accomplished! } Rd7 {So GK analysis suggests a whole different line I did not consider:  20...bxa5 21. Bxd8 Rxd8 22. Rxa5 Bb6 23. Raa1 Kf8 24. Rac1 Ke7 25. Bc4 Rd6 26. Bxd5 exd5 27. b4 d4 28. Rc4 dxe3 29. Rxe4+ Re6 30. Rxe6+ Kxe6  So you're still losing, but not as bad as what you played. Even still, I think you played really well in the line you did play. I think that combination would have worked on people much stronger than you.} 21. axb6 {Now this is the setup I was working for all this time!  My bishops and b6 pawn control or occupy the squares a7, b7 and c7. I am threatening to advance the pawn. As I see it, you will need to sac something to stop that pawn!} Bxb6 {And sac you did!} 22. Bxb6 {So I take back, leaving both bishops on the 6th rank, and one attacked and defended once on a6. This sets up what looks at a glance like an easy way for you to win back the bishop. But as I demonstrated, it's not so easy.} Rd6 {There it is! You attack my bishop on b6. The b6 bishop can't be defended, and if I move it, you take the a6 bishop with a rook.} 23. Bc4 {So instead of moving the b6 bishop, I move the a6 one, leaving both hanging! (Well, the c4 Bishop is not really hanging since your d5 bishop is pinned against your rook on d6.) You can't take either one since your rook is hanging on a8, with a mate threat on your back rank.} Rxa1 {So now you have to trade more. On one hand this does not remove the threat as I still have the same mate after I take back. On the other hand, where is the rook to go if you choose not to trade? There are no squares he can go where my bishops won't cause trouble. So I think 23...Rxa1 was best.} 24. Rxa1 {Now if 24...Rxb6 25.Bxd5 so it's just trading and I again have the mate threat.} h6 {This is the same move I would have made, yet GK analysis states you should have played 24...Rxb6 25. Bxd5 g5. Interesting...} 25. Bc5 { } Rc6 { } 26. Bxd5 { } exd5 { } 27. b4 {So at this stage, although I am winning, mate would be hard to come by without a pawn promotion. So I start advancing the little guy.} Rc8 {To prepare to defend your d pawn. } 28. Rd1 { } Rd8 { } 29. b5 { } f5 {I suppose you were trying to bring your king in the game. With a pawn on f7, the bishop blocks your king in.} 30. b6 { } Rb8 {You have no choice.} 31. Rxd5 { } g6 {Don't worry, it was not my plan to take on f5. My ambition at this stage is pawn promotion.} 32. Rd7 {The best place for a rook is on the 7th rank when the opponent king is on the 8th. Inn this case also, the rook & bishop work together to keep your king on the kingside away from the promoting pawn. Your king can only go back and forth between the g8 and h8 squares.} Rc8 {So you are in a form of Zugzwang here. Any move you make is going to help me. The move 32...Rc8 here just wastes time, as you can't afford to take my bishop. But you had nothing better.  I also understand you are following my suggestion that you never resign a tutoring game as there may be more you can learn later in the game. I hope and think my teaching further on in the game will be worthwhile to you.} 33. b7 {Of course you can't take the bishop as I mentioned before. } Re8 {This is better than going in front of the pawn, enabling me to play Ba7!} 34. Rc7 {So the goal is to trade rooks via 35.Rc8.} Rd8 {Threatening mate} 35. Rc8 {Pinning the rook so there is no mate threat, and so I can advance the pawn.} Rxc8 { } 36. bxc8=Q+ Kf7 {So when mating with and endgame queen (or rook, or bishop and knight), the goal is first to restrict the opponent king, second to work the king over to one edge of the board.} 37. Bd4 {So I want my bishop on e5. That would limit your king's movement to the kingside, and behind the pawns. Notice my queen covers all light squares, my bishop the dark ones to the left of your king with exception of e7.} Ke7 {So you do well to move away from the h-file where I want to send you.} 38. Be5 {To stop 38...Kd6.} Kf7 { } 39. Qd7+ {Similar to rooks on the 7th rank, my queen is best on any rank or file next to the edge of the board, with your king on the edge.} Kf8 {Again you are doing well to avoid voluntarily going towards the edge. Good.  From here I have different options, all leading to mate in three moves.} 40. Bg7+ {I chose this route simply because it's probably less like what most people would do. I also had: 40.Bf6 h5 41.Qe7+ Kg8 42.Qg7# or 40.Bf6 h5 41.Qg7+ Ke8 42.Qe7#} Kg8 41. Bxh6 {Now you can't stop the queen from coming over.} Kh8 42. Qg7# {Thanks Falcon67 for the game. I hope it was beneficial to you!}
