1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ gxf6 {6. ...Nxf6 is playable for black but White retains a solid centre and the advantage of the first move, and has a slight initiative with which Black has to reckon.  The game move offers black sharp counterplay along the g-file. However, the move loses tempo because Black will have to move the Knight in order to develop the bishop to g5} 7. Bd3 {the best square for the bishop because at c4 the bishop will be harrassed with Nb6 and Bg5 to follow. } Nb6 {preparing for Bg5} 8. h3 {a logical move to prevent Bg5 but it creates a weakness at g2.} Rg8 {attacking the weak point Black aims to complete his queen side development and then castle queen side. } 9. g4 {this is an over extension which is easily attacked by black. This is a typical novice mistake as a rule you should never play this move without being provoked} Qd5 {? Pins the knight, increase control of light squares and prepares for ...h5 or f5.  However, better for black is ... 9. ...h5! 10. gxh5 Qd5 and black is doing great. } 10. b3 {planning to follow up with c4} h5 {I wanted to get this move in before I am evicted from the 5th rank} 11. c4 Qe6+ {right now the game is equal. Black is cramped but has some counterattack going. White has a space advantage but no serious attack. Dispute being cramped black has the edge here. } 12. Be3 {This is better than 12. Be2 or Qe2 because of white's weakness on g-file. For example if white continues:  12. Qe2 then 12. ...Qxe2 13. Bxe2 hxg4 14. hxg4 Bxg4 and then black will eventually switch his light bishop to e4 and push the f pawn down the white king's throat. } hxg4 {opening up the g-file} 13. hxg4 Qxg4 14. Rh4 Qxh4 {I am glad for the simplification because I was starting to get lost in the many lines available to black. The queens are off the board and Black has a favorable endgame. } 15. Nxh4 Rg1+ 16. Ke2 Rxd1 17. Rxd1 e6 {preventing the d4 push and increasing control over f5} 18. Rg1 Nd7 {I am preparing to develop my bishop along the b7-h1 diagonal to increase control over the e4 square and to defend against Rg1} 19. Rg8 b6 20. Be4 Bb7 {The battle of the bishops is on} 21. Bh6 {White has made good use of his bishop pair. } Ke7 {I debated about 0-0-0 for awhile. In the end I did not think it would give me of anything of real value. The main reason why I decided not to castle was because f7 would be harder to defend if attacked. So 21. ...Ke7 still activates the rook plus it defends the f7 pawn} 22. Bxf8+ {White blunders and gives up. After 23. ...f5 white has serious trouble}
