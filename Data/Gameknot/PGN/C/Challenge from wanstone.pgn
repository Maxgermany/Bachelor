1. e4 {This is only my second game, trying out the Traxler counter gambit. As always, it's a fierce opening which leads to a quick defeat for white after 12 moves.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {So far so good.} 4. Ng5 {White goes on the attack, bringing forward the knight} Bc5 {So black counter attacks with the bishop   } 5. Nxf7 {This is possibly the more dangerous line for white to take at this point, but also the quickest route to material advantage. } Bxf2+ {Take that! - black invites white to take the bishop - opening up all sorts of nasty possibilities for black counterplay} 6. Kf1 {Black wisely declines to take the bishop for now and heads for cover on the f file} Qe7 {The black queen moves to safety} 7. Nxh8 {White chews up the available material} d5 {Black attacks and opens the diagonal for the LSB} 8. exd5 {p X p attacking the knight on C6} Nd4 {So the knight joins the attack, moving to d4} 9. h3 {White pushes the pawn to try and prevent the bishop on C1 staring down the queen on g4} Ne4 {So now the second knight joins the attack, creating a formidable centre} 10. c3 {White tries to push the knight from its perch} Qf6 {Black ignores the threat and creates an instant threat of its own down the f file} 11. g4 {White tries to create an escape hatch, but it's all over} Bg3+ {Bishop to g3 check (or to e1) leaves the King facing mate on the next move} 12. Kg1 Qf2# {The fat lady has sung.....}
