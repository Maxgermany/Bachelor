1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  Found this old game to give me and Master Freddy's long-suffering opponents some inspiration.  I take my hat off to Pearl, the Class C player in this game and I am about to play through it to see how she managed to overcome The Master Mater who was an Expert at the time this game was played.  Freddy kicks off with the Reti Opening which is Nf3 - this move develops a piece and hits out at e5.} c5 2. c4 {2. c4 - transposes into an English Opening.} Nc6 3. e3 d5 {3. ....... d5 - black decided to counter in the centre.} 4. cxd5 Qxd5 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3 - but a pawn trade takes place and now black's queen is gonna be pestered - she retreats to the safety of d8.} Qd8 6. Be2 {6. Be2 - with such a lead in development I bet you are wondering, how on earth does black manage to pull off an Expert Victory?  Well, read on.} e6 7. O-O Bd6 8. d4 cxd4 9. exd4 Nf6 {9. ....... Nf6 - black is catching up though and castles next move.} 10. Qb3 O-O 11. Bg5 {11. Bg5 - pin but it can be broken by Be7 and black plays it.} Be7 12. Rfd1 h6 13. Bf4 Nd5 14. Nxd5 exd5 {14. ...... exd5 - pawn trade.} 15. Ne5 Bf6 16. Bf3 Ne7 {16. ...... Ne7 - the pawn on d5 was attacked twice and only defended by the BQ, therefore this move was necessary to protect the isolani on d4.  Be6, developing a piece fails to Qxb7.} 17. Rac1 b6 18. Ng4 Bxg4 19. Bxg4 {19. Bxg4 - black trades her lsb for the knight on g4 to prevent her castled position being busted by Nxf6.  The move also clears the back row for black.  White has a terrific positional advantage though - it still seems inconceivable that he will end up on the losing side.} Ng6 20. Bc7 Qe8 21. Rde1 Be7 22. Qxd5 {22. Qxd5 - oh dear, now the d5 pawn does drop!} Qa4 23. Bf5 Bb4 {23. ....... Bb4 - now black tries some counterplay on the queenside but will it come off?} 24. Bxg6 Bxe1 25. Bxf7+ Rxf7 26. Qxa8+ Kh7 27. Bxb6 Bxf2+ {27. ...... Bxf2+ - there has been a plethora of exchanges and Pearl falls further behind in material but she is not gonna give up!} 28. Kh1 Qxa2 29. Qe4+ g6 {29. ...... g6 - if the BK goes to the back rank then Rc8+ could be unpleasant.} 30. Bc5 Qxb2 {30. ....... Qxb2 - black eliminates white's queenside pawns and material is even. Freddy moves his rook out of the black queen's line of fire.} 31. Rf1 Qb5 {31. ..... Qb5 - now the BQ makes Freddy hop around!} 32. Qb1 Qxb1 33. Rxb1 {33. Rxb1 - Freddy is no doubt mighty glad to see the back of his Wicked Witch of the West, the BQ.} Rd7 34. Rd1 h5 35. g3 a5 {35. ..... a5 - black rightly decides - passers must be pushed.} 36. Kg2 Be3 37. Kf3 Bg5 {37. ..... Bg5 - black's dsb must take evasive action as Freddy's king marches to the centre of the board.} 38. Ke4 Rb7 39. Rf1 h4 40. gxh4 Bxh4 {40. ...... Bxh4 - pawn trade.} 41. d5 Kg7 {41. ...... Kg7 - Freddy might want to put his rook on f7 should the BR move off the seventh rank (black's second rank) with a nasty check - this move releases the BR for action elsewhere.} 42. d6 Bf6 43. Kd5 Rb2 44. Rxf6 Kxf6 45. Ba7 {45. Ba7?? - Freddy, what about Bd4+?  That would have won the BR and the game!} Rd2+ 46. Bd4+ {46. Bd4+ - he plays it now but it is too late.} Kf7 47. Kc4 Ke6 48. Be3 Rxh2 {48. ...... Rxh2 - the BR gobbles up a white pawn on h2.  Why not Rxd6 here though?} 49. Kb5 Ra2 50. Kc6 Rc2+ 51. Kb5 Kxd6 {51. .... Kxd6 - at last the BK removes the pawn on d6.} 52. Kxa5 Ke5 {52. ...... Ke5 - the BK moves over to assist the g6 pawn to march to promotion.  If Freddy's dsb tries to stop that pawn then K and R against bare K is enough to force checkmate.} 53. Kb4 Kf5 {53. ..... Kf5 - Freddy realised that this was gonna happen and waved the white flag.  I guess this is a good example of how to save a lost game!  I will soon be studying Dana Mackenzie's How to Save Lost Postions so I am glad I went through this game. Pearl frustrated Freddy enormously and I think this could have resulted in Freddy missing that tactical shot which should have nailed the game down in his favour so all credit to Pearl for pulling this one off!  Hope you have all had an enjoyable read - I have!  Bye for now - Joanne}
