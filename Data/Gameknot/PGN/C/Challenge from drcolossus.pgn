1. e3 {The second game between me and brianmahagio - he beat me last time so I'm out for payback here.} e5 2. Bc4 {Trying to get him with 4 move checkmate, probably not going to work... but worth a shot.} d5 {Already foiled, but both of these pawns out like this leaving the king open probably not too good either.} 3. Bb3 Bc5 4. Qf3 {Still trying on 4 move checkmate... probably a mistake in retrospect.} Nf6 5. Nc3 {Knights come into play.} Bg4 6. Qg3 Qd6 {Moves his queen out... not too sure what he's trying to do with that.} 7. Nb5 {Threaten the queen - disrupt whatever it is he's doing.} Qe7 8. c3 Nh5 {Again, trying to assail my queen.} 9. Qxg4 {But the bishop is no longer protected so that happens.} Nf6 10. Qxg7 {Moving my queen right into his ranks. Can take the rook, but he can save it and threaten queen at same time } c6 {Not the best move, but trying to threaten knight here} 11. Qxh8+ {But a knight is worth a rook, - also, he's in check which buys me time to save the knight} Kd7 12. Nf3 {But I decide to move this knight out instead, so I can castle.} cxb5 {He takes the knight. Big suprise.} 13. O-O e4 {Threatening my other knight} 14. Ng5 a5 {Opening up a path for the rook -  cant move knight else Queen would take the rook.} 15. d4 {Force his bishop to move - also deadlocking centre pawns.} Bd6 16. f3 {Trying to coax him into takingpawn, so rook can move out to take knight - while being protected by queen} a4 {Doesn't take it... threatens bishop instead. } 17. Bc2 b6 {No idea what he was trying to do there.} 18. fxe4 {Path opened for rook.} dxe4 19. Rxf6 {Knight taken - rook now operating from a central position - good position to trap king later.} Nc6 {Moves his knight... exposing queen to rook, but I dont notice this...} 20. Nxf7 {instead moving my knight to take a pawn...} Rxh8 {he takes my queen. A big mistake on my part.} 21. Rf5 {Moving rook since it is no longer protected from queen.} Qe8 22. Bd2 {Allowing other rook out } Ne7 {Threatening rook} 23. Rf2 Rf8 24. Raf1 {Both rooks on same file... preparing for further aggressive moves.} h5 {I think he was trying to expose my castled king by forcing me to take a pawn. I saw this coming and pressed to attack to prevent him from capatilising on this.} 25. c4 h4 26. cxb5 Kc8 {A foolish move...} 27. Nxd6+ {...because now I fork his king and queen. He must move the king so...} Kd7 28. Nxe8 {...I take his queen. At which point he resigned, which was probably for the best. I had a substantial material advantage and coul of easily moved to trap the king with the 2 rooks, or promoted a pawn to queen and done it with that.}
