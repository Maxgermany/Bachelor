1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Kf2 Qh4+ {The beginning of the Tumbleweed opening.} 4. g3 fxg3+ 5. Kg2 gxh2 6. Rxh2 Qxe4+ {The Tumbleweed, in all its glory. White has open lines on the K-side to use for attack, and Black's Queen is exposed, but Black has a material advantage in return.} 7. Nf3 d6 8. Kg1 {Unpinning. White can get his KB and Q mobilized quickly.} Be6 {If Black can develop quickly, he will have the better game. The K-side Pawns will be an insurmountable endgame advantage, if Black can reach one.} 9. Nc3 Qg4+ 10. Rg2 Qh5 11. d4 Bg4 {A mistake. Black needs to get his pieces off the back rank with more alacrity, or White wil mobilize his forces and overwhelm him. 11... N-QB3 or 11... B-K2 were better choices.} 12. Rf2 Nd7 13. Qe1+ {Now the King's exposed position on the open file comes back to haunt Black. If he had played 11... N-QB3, he could have followed up with 12... O-O-O and his King would have been safe.} Ne7 14. Ng5 Nf6 15. Bc4 {Now White has five powerful attacking pieces. Black's defense must be exact.} Be6 16. Nxe6 fxe6 17. Bxe6 {This Bishop now dominates the board.} Qh4 18. Nb5 Kd8 19. Bf4 {Another White piece joins in. Now Black is in trouble.} Nc8 20. Qf1 Ng4 21. Bg5+ {Black resigns. if 21... QxB, 22 RxBch!! forces mate.}
