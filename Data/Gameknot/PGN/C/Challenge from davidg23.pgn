1. e4 {I had a peak at my opponents past games and seen he played the Sicilian when posed with 1.e4 and I though that it would be an interesting game seeing as I had come off of some nice positions in previous games against the Sicilian. Except against Marin.....that doesn't count :)} c5 {As expected. Here i was thinking of playing 2.d4 and attempting the morra gambit where white loses material for development after cxd4 3. c3, dxc3 4. Nxc3. However i had never played that gambit before and was unsure where it would lead so played the sounder 2.Nf6.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 Nbd7 7. Bc4 {Sicilian Najdorf Ivkov variation which usually leads to interesting middle games so i have read and so it turns out. Here i was expecting Qa5 which would continue the mainline to which white would respond with Qd2. Also all moves to date are book and on the GK database pretty popular.} Ne5 {This was a pretty unusual move and i couldn't find a variation on any website when i was doing this annotation to talk about it more. Although it forces the LSB back it has no real benefit as now white can win more territory and gain a tempi from black after Bb3, Nc6 reverting to another line of the Sicilian. Perhaps black should have waited and continued with the mainline so he can achieve more development as at the moment black has an inactive bishop.} 8. Bb3 e6 {This now makes the bishop more active but also closes the LSBs path, It also pins the knight to the queen these are typical in the sicilian opening, but perhaps something that could be exploited.} 9. f4 {A very aggressive response by white taking a stronger stance in the centre of the board and forcing the knight to go on the run.} Ng6 {(?) I am giving this as Nc6 seems more benficial and continues the strength of the sicilian where this now gives attacking options to white. IMHO white looks slighty stronger after this move. } 10. f5 {Continuing the pursuit of the knight to the view white should come out looking as strong as it went in and has the opportunity to exploit blacks 8th move e6.} exf5 11. O-O {The idea behind this is 11...., fxe4 12. Bxf6, gxf6 13. Nxe4, Be7 14. Qf3 giving white a good position although a pawn down, however after blacks next move white has a good advantage and should be able to capitalise.} Be7 {Declining the pawn instead opting for defence. which now allows white to disrupt blacks knight again.} 12. exf5 Ne5 {only safe place, apart from f8 which does nothing except clog up blacks back line and prevents castling.} 13. Re1 {And so the interesting middlegame begins. Applying pressure along the e file with a view to add more pressure to the knight with bishop and queen. Blacks position is soley a defensive counter attacking position so white still has to be careful of the king on g1, as a check on him could hand back an advantage to black, even though white does have the slightest of advantages.} O-O {Getting the king safe and fully developed with the exception of the LSB.} 14. Bf4 Qc7 15. Qe2 Bd7 {playing 16. Bxe5 loses for white dxe5 17. Qxe5 Bd6 18. Nd5 Nxd5. therefore i continued along the lines of pressurising the centre and a view to a possible combination. } 16. Rad1 Rfe8 {(?) This allows a neat combo (reason for Ra-d1 it will become apparent why) which gives white a good attacking option and black a headache! I can see why it was played so black can move Ne5 and protect the bishop. Although i think Bc6 is much better.} 17. Nd5 {This now allows white to carry out a small attack that is as subtle as a sledgehammer. It is not a winning attack apart from more position and it does ask alot of questions of black.} Nxd5 {expected allows black to free the bishop and protect the knight.} 18. Bxd5 Bf6 19. Qh5 {(!) Threatening f7 pawn after Ne5 is eliminated. This now forces black to open his kingside and gives white something else to attack and hopefully exploit.} g6 20. fxg6 Nxg6 {Nice move threatens bishop and rook whilst discovering a threat on the knight so Ra-d1 was well played. Now if white swaps rooks white is not In as strong a position as it could be. I also adopted the philosophy that the attacker should not swap pieces unless it is beneficial in the circumstances. therefore...} 21. Ref1 {guarding all the pieces and keeping the advantage of the position i have gained as well as a possible threat on the unprotected bishop.} Bxd4+ 22. Rxd4 {This now improves white chances as i still have the bishop pair nearing the endgame which is a great advantage in most cases against the bishop and knight paring.} Be6 {Was thinking Qxc2 might be played however i dont think that is such a good move after Rd2 black is forced back and white then has initiative from a similar position to this.} 23. c3 {Hedging my bets and making sure Qxc2 cannot be played as well as protecting the position.} f6 {(?) This now gives white the edge and allows for white to go for the "kill" although there are not many options open to black as the board stands...} 24. Bg3 {attack on the unprotected pawn which now allows for white to take advantage from this position.} Kg7 {From here white takes the material advantage as well as the positional one.} 25. Qf3 {a double attack on f6 and b7 pawns.} Qf7 {Only real option black can play.} 26. Bxb7 {White wins a pawn and after a small battle is able to hold on to the pawn advantage with the view to extending the material advantage.} Ra7 27. Bc6 {threatening rook also prevents any reinforcement to the d6 pawn which is getting eyed up by both rook and bishop.} Rb8 {sensing the fate of the d6 pawn black now trys for a trade of pawns though allowing the rook onto my back lines is not a very inviting option.} 28. Qf2 {(!!) This move now protects the pawn and is on the line to threaten rook and has the future option of harrassing the king on g7. something that is very beneficial if it can be developed a little more.} Bxa2 {Alot better than Rxb2 had i played Rxd6.} 29. Rxd6 {The trade of pawns which now gives white an awesome attack the f6 pawn with 3 major pieces. Note: The Queen also eyes up the rook on a7.} Rf8 {giving more fire power to the defence of f6. } 30. Rxf6 {This starts some very dubious moves by black.} Qe7 {What was wrong with Qxf6?, Qxa7 , Rf7, and see where that takes whites attack. This now loses the game for black indefinitely however the way white wins is helped by blacks choice of moves.} 31. Rxf8 {This now allows white to go ahead 5pts including a minor piece.} Nxf8 32. Qd4+ Kg8 {probably the best move for black as Kg6 or Kh6 although there are alot of options open to blacks king he will be harrassed and i am sure the long walk for the king would result in mate or the loss of the queen.} 33. Rxf8+ {taking with king is a terrible move as Bd6 is lying in wait.} Qxf8 34. Qxa7 {A rather nice final attack from white if i do say so myself :) Black now throwns in the towel but does not resign just yet.} Qf5 35. Qa8+ Kg7 {checking king and getting on same diagonal as bishop in order to harrass blacks queen.} 36. Be4 Qg5 37. Qa7+ {Bf7 prolongs the match, however black plays.} Kg8 38. Qxh7+ {Black resigns. I make my 5pts so now i move up to the rating of 1800-1900 to mount my challenge, after i finish the other 3 matches.  I should say from the position they are 2 forced mates. 1. Kf8, Bd6 , Qe7, Qxe7 , Kg8, Qh7# 2. Kf8, Bd6 , Ke8, Bc6, Kd8, Qd7#  I hope you enjoyed the game and found something useful somewhere in here. Any comments are welcome as if i missed something or didn't see value in moves which had been played or not played i'd appreicate you pointing them out to me.  Cheers, David .}
