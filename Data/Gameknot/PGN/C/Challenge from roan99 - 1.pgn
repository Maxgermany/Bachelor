1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {Fine says that most opening traps etc are based on attacking the KBP.  I see so many players doing this.  e6 seems the best defense.  I tried Nh6 which then gets hit by the B and ruins the king's haven.  it really cost me with gregulatot.} e6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. d4 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Nf6 7. Bg5 Nc6 {scaring the Q.  should be a song} 8. Qd2 O-O 9. O-O-O {white is ahead with devel., territory} Nb4 10. a3 Qc7 11. Bxe6 Bxe6 {black tries to get some edge.  white smugly goes for the trade and then B develops while trading} 12. axb4 {damn of course} a5 13. Nb5 Qb6 14. Na3 axb4 15. Be3 Nxe4 16. Bxb6 Nxd2 {that was an interesting switch.  this little point up I manage to keep but end up losing the endgame} 17. Kxd2 bxa3 18. bxa3 Rxa3 {activating rooks} 19. Rda1 Rfa8 {yeah, yeah, you don't really scare me} 20. Bd4 Bf6 21. Rxa3 Rxa3 22. Bxf6 gxf6 {that's a nasty little hole where my hopes used to be} 23. Rb1 Bd5 24. Rb6 Bxf3 25. gxf3 Rxf3 26. Ke2 Rh3 27. Rxd6 {now here I though I was OK.  comments about a smart plan for black are welcome} f5 28. Rb6 Rxh2 29. Rxb7 h5 30. Rb5 f4 31. c4 h4 32. Rh5 Kg7 33. c5 Kg6 34. Rh8 Kg5 35. Rg8+ Kf5 36. Re8 Kg4 37. c6 f3+ 38. Ke3 h3 39. c7 Rg2 {this is a mess now.  his K is really thwarting my hopes and his lovely little princess is about to become a queen.  that's essentially it.} 40. c8=Q+ f5 41. Rg8+ Kh4 42. Rh8+ Kg5 43. Rxh3 f4+ 44. Ke4 Kf6 45. Rxf3 Rg4 46. Qxg4 Ke7 47. Rxf4 Kd6 48. Rf5 Kc6 49. Qg6+ Kd7 50. Rf7+ Ke8 51. Qg8# {Nice job, Imun.  look out next time.}
