1. e4 {This is my first time at annotating a game.   Having played this in june i will not be able to remember why i made certain moves but i will have a fair idea of what it will  lead to!  So we start with the kings pawn opening!} e6 {My response. French Defense} 2. c3 {Attempting to bring his queen into the game } g6 {g6! Probably thinking along the lines of a fianchetto.} 3. d4 {Taking control of the centre.} f5 {Applying pressure on the e4 square} 4. e5 {Avoiding losing material} Bg7 {...and finishing the fianchetto which should have probably been done on the previous move} 5. Bd3 {Strengthing the centre} b6 {And again another fianchetto, attempting to gain control of the centre via the fianchettos} 6. Nf3 Bb7 7. Be3 Ne7 {Preparing for d5 to attack the bishop on e3} 8. Nbd2 Nd5 9. Qe2 Nxe3 {I swap material. I always feel that bishops fair better in open games and knights on closed and tight games as most people do. (i think anyway)   So with my bishops on the fianchetto i dont want his opposing bishops to counteract this.} 10. Qxe3 Na6 {Should have moved to c6} 11. Nb3 Qe7 12. Be2 c5 13. Rd1 c4 {Dont know why i did this} 14. Bxc4 Be4 {Or this} 15. Bxa6 Bc2 16. Ra1 Be4 17. Be2 Bxf3 {This time i take the knight, hoping for gxBf3} 18. Qxf3 {One can only hope} O-O {I castle and have both rooks lined up} 19. Ba6 {Notice how well my opponents pawn structure is, he can pass freely without hinder due to his bishop on the white squares} Bh6 20. O-O {He castles and looks very strong at the moment, his king is well defended and is a knight and a pawn up} d5 {Trying to gain control of the e file} 21. Nc1 {He denies the en passant capture} Qe8 22. Qg3 Qa4 {Trying to attack his bishop and the c2 square which is his weak point in the pawn structure cause it can lead to the capture of b2} 23. Qh3 {He attacks my bishop} Bd2 {And i move it to safety, i cant afford to lose any more material} 24. Qd3 Bh6 25. f4 {Strengthing the e5 pawn} g5 26. Qh3 Qc2 {Sacrificing the bishop to attack his pawn structure} 27. Nb3 Qxb2 28. Qxh6 g4 29. Qg5+ Kh8 30. Qe7 Rae8 31. Qxa7 Qxc3 32. Qxb6 {Remember how i wanted to attack from the sides, i think this plan failed :)} Qe3+ 33. Kh1 Rfg8 34. Nc5 Rg6 {Protecting the e6 pawn, and leading to rook to the h file to put pressure on his king} 35. g3 {To protect his pawn on h2} Rh6 36. Rfg1 Rh3 37. Nxe6 Rg8 38. Ng5 {Attacking the rook} Rxg5 {Removing the threat and attempting my first rook sacrifice} 39. Qd8+ {He denies it, and i protect my king with it} Rg8 40. Qxd5 Rg5 41. Bf1 Rg6 42. Bxh3 {My first sacrifice, and now i need to get his queen of the a diagonal for my sacrifices to count} Re6 {My second rook sacrifice} 43. Qxe6 gxh3 {I have mate in two now, his last hope now is to move back on to the a diagonal but the lure of more material must have won my opponent over} 44. Qxf5 Qf3+ 45. Rg2 {His only move} Qxg2# {I think my main point of this game was to show you that everyone makes mistakes but if you keep fighting and making good moves you can still win. As i said this is my first annotated game so any input will be greatly appreciated.  I would like to thank my good friend mel-lo on a good game!}
