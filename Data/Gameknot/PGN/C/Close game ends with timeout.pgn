1. Nc3 e5 {1. Nc3 is a very odd opening, considered by the world of chess experts to be too passive and therefore a weak choice, virtually never played at serious levels. I had no idea what to do with it, so I winged it, and turns out, I picked just about the worst possible "good" response, giving white a decent opening and a strong attack.} 2. e4 Nf6 3. d3 Bb4 4. Bd2 Nc6 {Actually, until now, everything seems to be OK. Both sides are developing more or less equally.} 5. Nf3 d5 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 8. Bxb4 Nxb4 9. Qd2 Qc5 {Taking the pawn at a2 would have probably lost black's knight.} 10. c3 Nc6 11. Qe3 Qb5 {Probably not a wise move. Threaten's a pawn, but also exposes the black queen to a discovery by by white's bishop. Probably should have found something more solid, like castling or bringing out my bishop. What can I say, I like attacking.} 12. b4 f6 {Not a good move either. Castling would have been better. This just ends up stranding an isolated pawn on e5.} 13. d4 Qd5 14. dxe5 fxe5 15. Rd1 Qe6 {Black's queen is now a patsy, tied to defense of a doomed pawn, an easy target for white as he brings pieces into play against her.} 16. Bb5 O-O {This doesn't save the pawn. All I wanted was to get my king out of danger and consider that lonely rook pawn on a2 as a fair exchange for losing the doomed pawn on e5.} 17. O-O Bd7 18. Bc4 Qxc4 {A sneaky trick by white, but it doesn't change much, althought white's rook on the 7th rank is scary for black.} 19. Rxd7 Rf7 20. Rd2 {Chased away the "ox" (rook on the 7th) and white chose to put it to defense, which is a good thing for black. It's time to get some rooks behind the doomed pawn and look to exchange my way out of danger.  Unfortunately, at this point I had a week-long sabbatacle to finish wiritng a novel, and put this game out of my mind - figuring to resume when I came back. I failed to take the timer into consideration, and black resultantly lost on timeout.}
