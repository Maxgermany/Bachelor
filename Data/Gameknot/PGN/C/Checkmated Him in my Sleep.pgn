1. c4 {An unrated game against a friend. I try something I never do. I play the English Opening. In some ways, it's basically like playing the Sicilian, but as white. With an extra tempo, since white goes first. Truth is, I don't really know this opening at all. I hope he appreciates the title - it's mean to be fun.} d6 2. Nc3 {Well, my limited opening reference doesn't even discuss 1. ... d6. There's some data in the GameKnot DB though, so I'm willing to follow that for a while.} Nf6 3. d4 {Occupying the center. How very un-English of me.} Na6 4. g3 {3. ... Na6 seems odd. I guess black didn't want 4. d5 to chase away his knight. But it has very little scope on a6. I decide to follow English principles and fianchetto the kingside bishop.} g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. Nf3 {Developing.} O-O 7. O-O c5 8. d5 {Locking up the center. Not sure why. I know my opponent favors frequent and early exchanges, so I, good-naturedly, try my best to confound him by avoiding them and keeping things complicated.} e5 9. Bg5 {The classic pin.} Bg4 10. Ne4 {The classic pressure to add after achieving the classic pin.} Bxf3 11. Bxf3 {The white knight was going nowhere. Exchanging it seems a bit premature here.} Rb8 12. Qa4 {Black seems to want to push his b-pawn. It might not accomplish much, but since he wants to do it, I want to stop him.} h6 13. Nxf6+ {Oops, gotta give that last move a ?: 12. ... h6. It looks like it drives away the white bishop, but it really just loses a pawn. The knight on f6 was defended twice, but only one defender can recapture (one of the drawbacks of defending minor pieces with the queen). And 13. Nxf6  gives check, so black cannot opt to take the white bishop instead.} Bxf6 14. Bxh6 Qe8 15. Qc2 {Black's rook is en prise, but he chooses to chase away my queen. I could exchange the royal ladies, but as I've noted before, black likes early and frequent exchanges, so when I play him, I like to keep things lively and avoid exchanges, even when I'm a pawn up and exchanging would be the smart thing to do.} Bg7 16. Bxg7 {Black's rook was trapped, 15. ... Bg7 was pretty much forced. I'll take this exchange.} Kxg7 17. a3 {Limiting the mobility of black's knight on a6.} Nc7 18. h4 {Time to march on black's vulnerable kingside.} Rh8 19. Kg2 {Nicely defended by black, so I get my king out of the way for my rooks.} b5 20. b3 {There's that move black wanted to make a while back, and now supported by 3 pieces. I want to leave my pawn at d5 supported without advancing my e-pawn yet.} bxc4 21. bxc4 Qc8 22. Rfh1 {Black is threatening a queen advance to h3, if I let him. I have to be careful now about advancing my pawns and trying to exchange rooks on the h-file or his queen may rear her ugly head in my camp.} Qf5 23. e4 {Or she may want to exchange. I still don't want to give up my lovely lady, so I reinforce the center.} Qd7 24. Rab1 {Contesting the only open file.} Rxb1 25. Qxb1 {I liked my rook on h1. The threat of black playing his pawn to g5 and opening that file, with his queen ready to pounce, left me reluctant to recapture with 25. Rxb1, despite my desire to post a rook on the open file. My queen will have to serve that duty for now.} Qa4 26. Qc1 {Black's queen forked two pawns. White's queen now forks her defense to the same two pawns.} Rb8 27. h5 {Black gets the open b-file, but suddenly I see a lovely little attack, made possible when black's rook abandoned his post on h8. This is where I entered a slew of conditional moves, covering an array of black responses, none of which did him much good. I went to bed and before I knew it, I had a checkmate message in my mailbox. I love checkmates in my sleep.} gxh5 28. Rxh5 {Black's king is tragically exposed, white has a rook and queen poised for the attack and black has nowhere to run. 27. ... g5 solves nothing after 28. Qxg5  and black is faced with imminent checkmate or with white promoting the h-pawn. 27. ... Kf8 lets black escape checkmate, but he he seems to the rest of his kingside pawns and must sacrifice to stop the advancing white pawn before it promotes. It looks, however, like black could have weaseled out with careful play. Instead, he captured the pawn. } Rh8 29. Qg5+ {Again it looks like black could have weaseled out, for now, with 28. ... Kf8, though it still looks grim: 28. ... Kf8 29. Qh6  Ke7 30. Qg5  Kd7 31. Bg4  Ke8 32. Rh8#} Kf8 30. Rxh8# {Final position.}
