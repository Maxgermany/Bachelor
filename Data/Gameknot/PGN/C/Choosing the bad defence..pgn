[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 2. e5 Bf5 {This is my favourite. I can manage white's lsb on my queenside. } 3. d4 e6 {Thematic. } 4. c4 {! Good, a theorical strike at the center seems good for white. The game will show why white has better to wait and develop a little more before this. } Bb4+ {It seems an useless attack. } 5. Nc3 {More aggressive and forceful was Bd7. White can allow himself to lose his "bad" bishop. } c5 {Black has all it needs to threat d5 after d4xc5. } 6. a3 {This is not so good, as it allows...} Qa5 {...and a3 is pinned to the Rook. True is that black lost his threat on d5, but it can wait. White should have gone for Bd2 (defending the R), renewing the threat on the black's dsb. Not doing so costs black the game. You have to recognize a strong attack when it cames, and the best thing is to try to develop, defend and exchange whenever not dangerous. } 7. Nge2 {Not bad, supporting the other N in case of BxN. But it allows...} dxc4 {Bd2 was the best white's option. } 8. dxc5 {This made me think on a plan. } Bxc5 {Not fearing c4 due to cxb3. } 9. Bd2 {Finally! Unfortunately, now it's too late, since white opened the center to my dsb.} Qb6 {Threatening Bxf2#!} 10. Qa4+ {Leaving the King and escape route with tempo. Be3 fails to BxB, fxB, Qxe3, with Bd2 coming soon. } Nc6 {Almost nothing changed for white. f2 is not defendable. } 11. Qxc4 {This greedy move leaves b2 undefended. Normally, it would be a "poisoned pawn", but after...} Bxf2+ {...Qxb2 threatens Bc2#. My opponent resigned. The game could have gone on with...} 12. Kd1 Qxb2 {This is really nasty. White has a lot of tricks and problems, here. 13. Ra2 fails to Bc2#! The only possible move is} 13. Rc1 {Now, Nxe5 seems good, but it isn't. Qb5+, QxQ, NxQ lets a lot of attacking ways for white. fen="r3k1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/1N2nb2/8/P7/3BNbPP/2RK1B1R b kq -" So black better goes...} Rd8 {It's Qxd2 mate, and the only defence is } 14. Ne4 {Qf4 allows Qb3+ and mate. } Be3 {Black still can't move the Nc6 without causing the Q's exchange and countergame for white. } 15. Rc2 {Forced. The Q will be overloaded. IT SEEMS that black has a won game, but after... Qb1+, Nc1! and black's attack loses steam. Qa1+, Nc1, Qxa3 is not very consueling for such a big attack. Maybe...} Qxe5 {Attacking the N. It is very probably that in the previous sequence I missed something, a winning sac or so. } 16. Ne2g3 {Naturally opening itself, assuring the protection of d2 by either N, opening the way for lsb...} Rd4 {A hard move to meet. NxBf5, RxQ, Nd6+ seems promising, but the situation is not all that clear after 17. NxB, RxQ, Nf5-d6, and it does not compensate the Q's sac. On the other side, white is losing a minor piece, Ne4. White seems just lost. } 17. Qb5 {You can amuse yourself trying to find some other move, but white will emerge with a +5 material deficit in most lines I explored, for a solw lost engame. } Bxe4 18. Nxe4 Qxe4 19. Qxb7 Rxd2+ 20. Rxd2 Bxd2 21. Kxd2 Qd5+ 22. Bd3 Nf6 23. Qa8+ Nd8 24. Qxa7 Ne4+ 25. Ke3 Qc5+ 26. Qxc5 Nxc5 27. Bb5+ Ke7 {...as you can see, a won game by black, but rich of tactics here and there. } 28. a4 Ndb7 29. Ra1 Ra8 30. Bc6 Ra5 31. Rb1 Nd8 32. Bf3 Rxa4 {}
