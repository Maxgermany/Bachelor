1. e4 {This was our first game back at Gameknot.com since our University days.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {All pretty standard stuff so far.} a6 {I didn't want Bb5, and figured I could fianchetto eventually.} 4. Bc4 h6 {My development is a bit weird and slow - preventing Ng5 here.} 5. O-O Nf6 6. h3 b5 7. Bd5 Nxd5 {Removed his white bishop so that my own white bishop can own the A8-H1 diagonal.} 8. Nxd5 Bc5 {Plan is to have both bishops pointing straight at his King} 9. d3 Bb7 10. c3 d6 11. Be3 Ne7 12. Bxc5 Nxd5 {I could've just taken his offending bishop, but this seems to clear out the centre a bit and I should hopefully be a pawn up.} 13. exd5 dxc5 14. Nxe5 Qxd5 {He has to defend the checkmate on G2.} 15. Qf3 {I considered taking the unprotected knight, for about 2 seconds before realising my queen would get pinned} O-O-O 16. Nxf7 {A fork. But I'll pin it to his queen.} Rhf8 17. Qxd5 {He had to really, or he would have lost his Knight...} Rxd5 18. Nxh6 {but the knight is lost anway, though it ate a few pawns before dying.} gxh6 19. Rad1 Rfd8 20. f4 {I'm not sure why he gave up the d3 pawn without a fight.} Rd5xd3 21. Rxd3 Rxd3 22. Rf2 Rd6 23. Kh2 {Let's see how his 1-3 pawns fare against my extra bishop...} Kd7 24. Re2 Re6 {I offer the trade, feeling confident in my bishop vs pawns} 25. Rxe6 Kxe6 26. g4 Kf6 27. Kg3 Bd5 28. a3 Bf7 29. f5 {What to do here... I considered advancing my king, but it would have been repelled by his H pawn. Offering up my own H pawn to trade with his G pawn would have prevented his pawns reinforcing eachother.} h5 30. Kf4 {Of course he doesn't take it.} hxg4 31. hxg4 Bc4 {I really liked this spot for my bishop. When things come down to the bitter end his King can't cross any of D3-6. It also poses a challenge for him to get his pawns through G8 and F7.} 32. g5+ Kg7 33. Ke5 Kf7 34. g6+ Kg7 35. Kf4 Kf6 {And I'm through, just need his King to back off some more.} 36. Kg4 Bd3 37. g7 Kxg7 38. Kg5 Kf7 39. f6 Bg6 {The king's only option is to step away from the pawn. So he plays for time on the other side of the board} 40. b4 c4 41. Kf4 Kxf6 42. Ke3 {Racing to the A1 corner} Ke5 43. Kd2 Ke4 44. Kc2 Ke3+ 45. Kb2 Kd2 {Pretty soon the king will run out of moves and he will be forced to advance the a3 pawn and lose it.}
