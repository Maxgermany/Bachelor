[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D00)"]

1. d4 {A rather secure and good opening move.} d5 {Probably the best response.} 2. Be3 {A bit defensive; a move to the fourth rank is more aggressive and probably better. } Bf5 {Aggressive.} 3. c3 {Bolstering the defensive formation; though White should have moved the knight out first.} Nc6 {Black remains aggressive, though not stupidly so.} 4. h3 {Setting up 5.g4 and attacking the bishop.} Bg6 {Black wants to keep the presence on this diagonal and moves the bishop back to avoid threat of capture.} 5. g4 {White follows through and attacks the kingside, or at least sets up for it.} f6 {Black, meanwhile, is looking to expand his center presence.} 6. Bg2 {White's forces are gathering on the kingside, while Black's forces look rather weak.} e5 {Time to get going.} 7. f4 {White wishes to keep his center strong.} exf4 {Black is trying to get White's forces even more concentrated (and cramped) on one side.} 8. Bxf4 {White captures and has a decent setup.} Be4 {Time, now, to start attacking White, or at least blow up the formation.} 9. Nf3 {White likes his formation and will block the attack, though this does severely limit the scope of the bishop.} Bd6 {Now the bishop standoff is complete.} 10. Be3 {White is retreating towards the center.} Nge7 {Time to get the other pieces involved.} 11. Nbd2 {Attacks the bishop.} Ng6 {Black has the bishop protected and wants to get the knight in there.} 12. Nxe4 {And White will follow through.} dxe4 {Retaking the knight.} 13. Nh4 {A bad move to get the knight out of the way; Nd2 was much better.} Nxh4 {A break; Black takes the undefended bishop and has good position with his knight to harass White.} 14. Bxe4 {White needs to get the bishop out of the way and will take the undefended pawn.} Qe7 {Black sees that the bishop is undefended and will get the queen into the game by threatening both bishops on the file.} 15. Bxc6+ {That takes care of the one bishop.} bxc6 {No other choice.} 16. Bf2 {This protects against 16...Bg3+ and attacks the knight.} Ng2+ {Black takes his other secure check.} 17. Kd2 {Not a good move; Kf1 would have been much better and would have avoided exposing the king.} Bf4+ {Keeping up with the checks.} 18. e3 {A decent block, though not ideal.} Nxe3 {Rather than just check again, the knight attacks the queen and sets up a discovered check.} 19. Bxe3 {White will part with his last minor piece; he has little choice.} Qxe3+ {Now Black has infiltrated White's position badly.} 20. Kc2 {The only legal move.} Qe4+ {Black now forces the king to really run away.} 21. Qd3 {Or trade queens.} Qxd3+ {And Black will.} 22. Kxd3 {Again, the only move to be made.} O-O {Black doesn't have much opportunity to get great pawn structure and will instead get the rooks going, exploiting the extra piece.} 23. Rae1 {White needs to attack soon.} Rfe8 {Black is perfectly willing to trade pieces away and make the advantage of the extra bishop that much more dramatic.} 24. Re4 {This move is rather superfluous other than giving White an attack on the bishop.  Not a bad idea though.} Rxe4 {The best move.} 25. Kxe4 {Of course.} Bd6 {The bishop is moved to safety.} 26. b4 {Time to get aggressive; the only thing White has left.} Re8+ {A rather cheap but easy check.} 27. Kd3 {White will retreat a bit and defend his pawns.} a5 {Black is looking to eliminate pawns as well.} 28. b5 {White ought to have taken the a-pawn.} cxb5 {Black will take the pawn.} 29. d5 {Aggressiveness till the end.} b4 {Same for black.} 30. Kc4 {The king trying to make a move.} bxc3 {Black is rather preventing this.} 31. Kxc3 {The only decent move.} Re3+ {Time to start picking off White's pawns, and this check starts it.} 32. Kc4 {White is determined not to get pinned back.} Re5 {Black will set up for his next move.} 33. Rb1 {White getting ready for some sort of check.} c6 {Black will give up this pawn as well, knowing he will get it back.} 34. dxc6 {White will take it and hope for a mistake.} Rc5+ {And Black does not make one.} 35. Kd4 {Getting out of the way.} Rxc6 {Taking the pawn.} 36. Kd5 {The king needs to attack; waiting around for Black to do something is certain death.} Ra6 {The only move to save both pieces.} 37. a4 {A waiting move.} g6 {Black is looking to take both White pawns on the kingside.} 38. h4 {White must do something, after all.} f5 {And the attack starts.} 39. gxf5 {Nothing else to do.} gxf5 {Likewise.} 40. h5 {There is really no other move.} Kg7 {The king's services are finally needed.} 41. Rb7+ {Now for the weak checks.} Kf6 {The king must protect his own pieces.} 42. Rxh7 {Now White has a possible route to promotion.} f4 {Pressing on.} 43. Rh6+ {Another check.} Kg5 {Black has no recourse.} 44. Rh8 {White is not willing to give up his last piece.} f3 {Promotion coming soon.} 45. Rh7 {Waiting around and establishing a safe route to the f-file.} f2 {Forcing White to do something, Black will either get a queen or White's last free pawn.} 46. Rf7 {White fears a last queen.} Bg3 {A decent defense; Black is toying with White.} 47. Ke4 {White needs to get the king closer to the action.} Rf6 {White ensures promotion.} 48. Rxf6 {White resigns himself to his fate.} Kxf6 {Black has the game by the throat.} 49. h6 {Keeping Black honest.} Kg6 {Black won't give up a queen under his nose.} 50. h7 {Nothing else to do.} Kxh7 {White's last hope is gone.} 51. Kf3 {White will at least get the bishop.} f1=Q+ {Here is the promotion.} 52. Kxg3 {Nagging the undefended bishop.} Qd1 {Black has no interest in a king-and-queen checkmate.} 53. Kf4 {Monkeying around.} Qxa4+ {White has nothing left.} 54. Ke3 {Moving out of the way.} Qb3+ {Getting out of the way of the pawn.} 55. Kd2 {Setting himself up for the noose.} a4 {Black wants a last promotion.} 56. Kc1 {Hoping Black will make a mistake.} a3 {Promotion coming.} 57. Kd2 {Desperate.} a2 {Promotion is a move away.} 58. Ke2 {Run away!} a1=Q {Here comes the checkmate.} 59. Kd2 {Any move will do.} Qaa2+ {Avoids letting the king out and prolonging the game any more.} 60. Kc1 {Anything goes.} Qbb1# {And it's done.}
