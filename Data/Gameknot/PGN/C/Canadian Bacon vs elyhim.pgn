[Opening "King's Indian (E92), Gligoric-Taimanov system"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {So my fellow comrades decide to play the Classical Kings Indain. Most times, it ends in a tactical draw. Though I think white has the better chances for a win. This opening choice no doubt has one of our better players on the team's influence. He is an expert in the KID. At this point I was aiming for a Catalan formation with g3 and Bg2 } 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 {Discouraging black most natural way to free himself. Which is ....Nh5 followed by the tactical ...f5. At that is what black aims for most cases in the kings Indain.  } e5 7. Be3 {In  a game back in 2005 Abitipower and I came to a similar position where I had played the much slower d4-d5(attempting to block out the DSB). Nowadays, Be3 is arguable the move of choice. For one it sets up the favorable Macrozy bind. According to the comments on the form page my comrades were expecting 7. d5 with a good chance that ...Nh5 and ...f5 are to follow.  } Ng4 {!? I like and dislike this move by my comrades. I like it because it gains valuable initiative on the E3-bishop. On the other hand black invests considerable king side weaknesses to gain that initiative.  } 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 g5 {!? A critical moment in the game. Black has committed himself for boom or bust on the king side. Meanwhile, white still temporarily has his centre and a slight lead in development. All and all though the game is dynamically level.  Alternative variation: 9... Nc6 10. d5 Nd4 11. Nxd4 exd4 12. Qxd4 g5 13. Bg3 f5 [⩲] } 10. Bg3 Nh6 {expected black wants to get in his favored ...f5. At this point I see that there is no real good way for me to stop it so I decide not try. What I plan to do is make good use of the king side weakness. At this point I was not sure how I was going to do that. } 11. h3 exd4 {⇄ Black has to play this double edged move if he hopes to get in ...f5. Reason being is that they have to deflect my f-knight away from contesting g5 so that ...f5 can be played without worrying about the weakness created on g5. Even so, the holes on black's king side begin to show signs of fatigue. } 12. Nxd4 Nc6 13. h4 {I kinda like this move. It hits at black's most pressing weakness while at the same time adds a much needed offensive to white's game. The opening of the h-file will be of great use for me. So I am willing to concede control of the F-file to black for the time being. This is a move that I expect came as a surprise to most engaged in the game.  } f5 14. hxg5 Bxd4 15. gxh6 {I have no intention of wasting time castling. Along with 13. h4 I planed to activate my rook on the h-file.  The king will stay in the center to help support f2 for now.  } fxe4 {The pressure on f2 begins to mount. I must admit that I knew instinctively that I was fine defensively but I also knew that I needed to get things going offensively quickly. } 16. Nxe4 {So far so good I have managed to frustrate my comrades on the f-file. Though they do have respectable pressure on f2 it is not enough for a break through. I would have to give them leading edge in this position. Especailly, after their next move.  } Qe7 {! A very awkward moment for me. I am forced to retreat the knight back to c3 and allow black greater share of the centre. Not to mention deflecting a piece away from the defense of f2. As you can see f2 becomes the focal point for sometime. Meanwhile the pawn on h6 lays quietly just waiting to be picked off.  } 17. Nc3 Qf6 {This move does look good but I think black is over estimating their chances on f2.  Alternative variation: 17... Bxc3+ 18. bxc3 Bg4 19. f3 Be6 20. Kf2 maybe black's only opportunity to get out with a draw.  } 18. Kf1 {!! I give this a brilliance because the reason for it is obvious and subtle. The king is taking matters of his own safety into his hands by walking himself to g1. Castling is out because then black would be able to take on h6 with a guaranteed draw.  I would say that black is doing OK but the picture is starting to become very complex for him. Even the chess engine suggests 18.0-0 but I was felt that the rook had better chances of getting action via the h-file. I also felt that I had to keep the h6-pawn because it was controlling the critical mating square of g7.  } Bxf2 {This little sac is what makes 18. Kf1 so amazing. I mean who has the balls to put their king on a open file controled by the enemy rook+Queen! } 19. Ne4 {! The knight returns! This move is what makes 18.Kf1 work. Black does not have a discover check because of fork on his queen. Thus black will have to retreat the queen and allow white to regain the material. Still the wide open f-file dominated by the black rook keeps black in the game.  } Qg6 20. Bxf2 Qxe4 21. Kg1 {!! As my comrade Blunderball and Pawnrider pointed out 21. Qd5 leads to a long fighting draw. I found this move as an alternative. It services two purposes, first it guards f2 and gets the king off the hot f-file.   Alternative move: 21. Qd5+?! Qxd5 22. cxd5 Ne5 23. Rh5 Bf5 } Ne5 {By now black has almost depleted himself against my pawn wall, which is a typical thing that my opponents do against me. Meanwhile my white troops are about to fulfill their destiny. } 22. Rh5 {! If I had castled back at move 18. This initiative gaining move would not be possible. Like I said earlier the benefits of 18. Kf1 are more than the obvious.  } Bf5 {?! It is hard to discredit such a naturally good looking move but this is problematic for black. #1 It temporarily lessens the pressure on f2 long enough for me to better position my DSB. #2 I really do think that 22...Qg6 followed ...Be6 or ...Bd7 is the only way out for black.  Alternative variation: 22... Be6 23. Rg5+ Kh8 24. Qd2 Rf6 25. Rf1 is roughly equal } 23. c5 {Nasty little move isn't it! opens the a2-g8 diagonal for the LSB, undermines the e5-knight and gains tempo for Qd2. My plan is to gain control of the G-file. I feel that if I can succeed in that then my chances of success are really high.  } Rf6 24. Qd2 {controlling the critical g5 square.  } Kh8 {Only move Alternative variation: 24... Raf8 [?!] 25. Rg5+ Bg6 26. Bd4 [±] } 25. Rg5 Rg8 26. Bg3 {+⁠− Black's long standing pressure on f2 has been eliminated. While white has built a strong initiative on e5 and the g-file.  } Rfg6 27. Bf4 Re8 28. Rf1 {Black has multiple threats to deal with can you list them? } Qc2 29. Bh5 {Of course note 29. Qxc2?  Alternative variation: 29. Qxc2 Bxc2 30. cxd6 cxd6 31. Rc1 Be4 [ with a small possibility of a hard long fight to a draw for black.] } Qxd2 30. Bxd2 Rxg5 31. Bxe8 Rg8 32. Bf7 { The bishop pair work better that a Queen.  } Bd3 33. cxd6 cxd6 34. Rf4 {No matter what now black will go down in material. Plus with pawn majorities on both sides of the board white's triumph is assured.  } Rf8 35. Bd5 Rxf4 {I was superised to read my comrades chatter at this point which revealed no talk of defeat. Either they did not understand that they were about to go down a pawn. Or they were being hopefully optimistic.  } 36. Bxf4 Bg6 37. Bxb7 Kg8 {The king finally escapes from his dungeon but a little to little now.  } 38. Be3 {Alternative variation: Equally good is 38. Bxe5 dxe5 39. Kf2 Bf7 40. a3 Bb3 41. Ke3 Kf7 42. Be4 Kf6 43. Bxh7 Kg5 44. Bf5 Kxh6 45. Ke4 } a5 39. b3 Bb1 40. a4 Bc2 41. Bd5+ {the pawn on a5 will fall and there is no way of stopping the white rook pawn }
