[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 { Gotta love king pawn opening, it opens up two positional promotion routes for the queen and bishop. } e5 {Copycat...} 2. Nf3 {Maintaining the tempo, and making the opponent respond to my move} f6 {Classic black defence.} 3. d4 {Queen pawn follow up allows for the removal of the e5 pawn, via a pawn for pawn trade} Bd6 {Bishop maintains the tension in the middle four squares} 4. Nc3 {Classic attack, the knight allows for a wide variation of attacks } c5 {Black is directly challenging the centre four squares but is at a disadvantage, the pawns only attack the black squares and there are limited follow on options with blacks setup} 5. dxc5 {Pawn takes pawn to attack the bishop with both the pawn and the queen.} Bxc5 {Bishop makes only obvious move. Opens black up to a structural weakness as no pawns can threaten d5} 6. Nd5 {Knight promotion to d5 results in a long term structural problem for black.} Qa5+ {A wasted move, that allows for the promotion of my bishop to directly threaten the queen, causing a temporal advantage} 7. Bd2 {Black is now completely reactive } Qa4 {This move surprised me. As a result the d5 knight has a choice, push forward for the fork or withdraw to c3 to threaten the queen and protect the e4 pawn and king.} 8. Nc3 {DEFENCE DEFENCE DEFENCE... Structural defence to protect my centre and left side (a side)} Qc6 {Queen withdraws, maintaining attack on e4, but with the pawn on e6 this is a non event threat, if black's next move was pawn to f5 it would change the tempo of the game. It would cause the re-direction of effort from aiming at the A side to aiming at the more vulnerable H side, kings weak side.} 9. Bd3 {Bishop promotion combines the queen thru to bishop synergies. Allows for king side castle and protect f2 with the king and rook.} b5 {I don't see the point of this move.... It doesn't allow for new lines of attack or threaten me to require a response. This in context with the ability to castle king side means minimal effect} 10. Nd5 {Returning knight to d5, limits movement of black and reopens the c7 fork. Need to wait for pawn push to d6, this enables queen to e2. To drive a pin from b5 through the queen onto the king.} a6 {The possible pin is mitigated by the pawn to a6, bishop to b4 threatens the black c5 bishop, while being covered by the d5 knight. Three obvious moves 1- black Bishop takes the b4 bishop 2- the a pawn is moved forward to move the white bishop 3 - d pawn move to support the black bishop} 11. Bb4 {Wait for the response.   :)} d6 {Opportunity to setup the queen-king pin, promote my queen, and also protect from the attack on f2, or setup knight to get behind the h-side pawn line} 12. Nh4 {Push knight forward to increase the complexity of the attack....} a5 {A pawn to move my bishop.... Promote queen to enable the pin, sacrifice bishop for the queen.} 13. Qe2 {Execute!!!!} axb4 {Trap sprung!!} 14. Bxb5 {SURPRISE!!! } Bg4 {Temporal advantage, take queen then take bishop} 15. Bxc6+ {Bazinga! Expected move knight takes my bishop. Then my queen will take the g4 bishop.} Nxc6 16. Qxg4 {Queen takes knight, blocks possible castle to a side. Expected move pawn f6 to f5 to attack the queen and open up the knight.} Rd8 {Block in h side, also enables the queen to attack the g7 pawn.} 17. Nf5 h5 {Queen to g6 or to g7 G6- check, k to d7, q to g7 check either knight to e7 or king to c8. G7- allows for Q to press h8 then h7} 18. Qxg7 Bxf2+ 19. Kxf2 Rd7 20. Qxh8 Kd8 21. Qxg8# {}
