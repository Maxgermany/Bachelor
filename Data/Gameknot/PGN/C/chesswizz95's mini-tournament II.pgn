1. d4 {This is a game that I just won and I was proud of it, mainly because of the end. I'm white.} d5 2. Nc3 e6 3. Bf4 {My favorite opening, if I get the chance to do this opening I always do.} a6 {Doesn't want me to move my Knight to b5, threatening a fork. Really a good move in my oppinion, if I get to move my knight their I get a position lead, usually. Either forcing Knight to a6 or doubling pawns with an even trade on d6 after Bishop moves to d6.} 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. e3 Nf6 6. a3 {Don't want a fork.} Bd6 7. Bg5 O-O 8. Bd3 Be7 9. Ne5 {This starts an unusual situation.} Nxe5 10. dxe5 Nd7 11. Bxe7 {This gives me the move I wanted.} Qxe7 12. h4 {I know this move is very unusual, I needed to keep his queen away for my plan.} Nxe5 {He took the bait I gave him. That even trade which put my pawn out in the open could have gave him a pawn, but I found a way out which messed up his kingside castle.} 13. Bxh7+ {That's what I was looking for, it may seem bad at first glance but it leads to a pawn gain plus it exposes his king.} Kxh7 14. Qh5+ {Their's the even trade ;)} Kg8 15. Qxe5 {Now it seems I have a better position, only one problem is the sacrifice of moving my h pawn up making a king side castle weak, although a castle didn't seem very good anyway.} f6 16. Qd4 Bd7 17. Qd2 {Didn't like my queen out there.} Kf7 {Wants to move his rook to the h file.} 18. O-O-O {Looked better than king side.} Rfh8 19. g3 {I wanted the freedom to move my rook later on.} c6 20. e4 b5 {Starting to advance his pawns quite a bit.} 21. Rhe1 {May fall for the bait again.} dxe4 {Yep, he did.} 22. Qxd7 {He's in a pretty bad situation now.} Rad8 {Forces me to make even trade.} 23. Qxe7+ Kxe7 24. Rxd8 {I'd like another one please, helps relieve pressure on my king side.} Rxd8 25. Nxe4 {Saved that move for a while, gaining a pawn.} a5 {Still advancing those pawns, but that's about all that's left. I expected him to guard the king side a little more.} 26. Nc5 e5 27. f4 {Now I'd like some more pawn trades, obviously black tries to control the field.} Rd5 {I didn't expect that but not much of a threat.} 28. Nd3 Kd6 29. b4 axb4 30. Nxb4 {I liked this because it threatens a pawn getting through.} Rd4 31. Rd1 {I decided that rook was too much of a bear to control, and I analyzed to see if I'd have a good position, I need to keep his pawns back and push mine ahead. From now on I must be very careful.} c5 32. fxe5+ {Get that trade over with.} fxe5 33. Rxd4+ cxd4 {I analyzed this very thoroughly to see if i could keep his d and e pawns back.} 34. Kd2 Ke6 35. g4 {Keeping his king away from my king side pawns, they have a good position.} e4 36. Nc6 {Now is time for my knight to start making threats, I need to take advantage of my lead.} Kd5 37. Na7 Kc4 {I expected both moves, I had a plan.} 38. Nc6 Kc5 39. Ne7 Kc4 40. Nf5 {This move is basically the reason I won.} e3+ 41. Ke2 {Now you may think, 'black's advancing really well, STOP HIM", But watch.} Kc3 {May look strong but look again, it's easy to see.} 42. h5 {what now, Kxc2 will make black lose ALL his pawns.} Kc4 {Realises his mistake.} 43. Nxg7 {Black resigns, knows he can't advance any pawns now; and he can't stop mine.}
