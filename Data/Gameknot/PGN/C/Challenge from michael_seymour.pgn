1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 {Was initially thinking of Queen's gambit (c4) but decided to secure the centre with a Knight first.} e6 3. c4 {Here comes the c4 pawn} dxc4 {accepted.  Black is now up by one pawn but is at risk of becoming distracted by protecting his pawn advantage and falling behind in developing is primary pieces.} 4. e4 {Strong centre attack with two pawns.  Also unmasks attack on black's pawn on c4.} b5 {Black tries to keep his pawn advantage, but at the cost of giving up the centre and development.  White has one piece in play, black has none.} 5. Nc3 {! Develops another piece and places further pressure on black's pawn advance.} Bb4 {Pin Knight to King to prevent it moving.  At least this is a developing move, but with the bishop out so far it can easily be deflected by p-a3.} 6. a3 {Force black to move his bishop again.} Bxc3+ {Black goes for the exchange!} 7. bxc3 Nf6 {And now black can bring a piece into play.} 8. Ne5 {? White pushes into the centre although this may be a bit premature with no other pieces developed yet.} O-O {Protects the King and allows a rook some freedom.} 9. Qf3 {? White elects to protect the pawn with his Queen instead of breaking his 3 castle side pawn rank. White's early advance of his Knight is coming back to bite him.  If his Knight was still on f3 then p-e5 would have forced black to move his Knight. } Bb7 {! Black's "fianchetto" bishop is pinning white's pawn on e4 to his queen (it's only protecting at present).  This pawn is unprotected } 10. Qd1 {? White retreats but probably not to the best place (too far).  He has lost the developing advantage and another pawn!} Nxe4 11. Qc2 {Counter attack and re-develops his queen with a line on h7 - a possible early mate square.} Bd5 {Black takes more control of the centre now, despite white's more advanced pawn.} 12. Nf3 {? Why not develop another piece (eg black square bishop).  White was perhaps nervous now he is 2 pawns down.} c6 {Black's bishop is hemmed in, but this is ok as he is pawn supported and can't be attacked by a pawn.} 13. h4 {White is going for an early mate.  His queen needs protection, eg by a Knight on g5, but this would need to be pawn supported due to his queen covering that square.} f6 {black sees this and simply uses a pawn to prevent posting a Knight on g5, freeing up his queen.} 14. Be2 {Developing this bishop on the only square he can realistically go to now.} Qa5 {pins pawn on c3 to King.} 15. Bd2 {White prepares a counter (freeing his queen from protecting the pawn)} Nxd2 {Black goes for the exchange.} 16. Qxd2 Na6 {Although on the outside of the board (normally a bad position for a Knight), better here (attacking c5) than undeveloped.  Black's development is almost complete.  A rook on d8 would finish it.} 17. O-O {As black has no black square bishop the escape square on h2 is a good one.} c5 {Black pushes his pawn trying to free up the game.  Being slightly ahead on material and with his powerful centre bishop he has the advantage.} 18. dxc5 {this is preferable to white than if black takes first and ends with a passed pawn on c4!} Nxc5 19. Nd4 {White tries for a better position for his Knight and protects the possible rook/queen fork square on b3} Nb3 {? forces a Knight exchange and wins a passed pawn.  Better may have been p-e5 attacking white's Knight, which if moved will win a better prize!} 20. Nxb3 {White exchanges although he is now facing a dangerous passed pawn.} cxb3 {Black needs to make sure can can continue to protect this advanced pawn.} 21. Bf3 {Attacks the sole protector of the advanced pawn.} Bxf3 {Black goes for the exchange.} 22. gxf3 Rae8 {... and now threatens with a possible pawn push on the other side. With blacks developed position and advanced pawns exchanges will generally favour him.} 23. Qb2 {White's rook is stuck defending a pawn on a3.  This position of his queen protects two pawns at least for now and also attacks blacks pawn.} Qa4 {Black also moves to protect } 24. Rab1 {white "doubles up" with the threat of Q for Q plus P.} Qxh4 {Black gives up on his pawn and goes for material.  A pawn developed so far advanced without pawn support this early (with queen and both rooks on the board) is hard to keep.} 25. Qxb3 Qg5+ {Black goes on the attack with the thought of possible mate with white's king trapped on the side.} 26. Kh2 Qf4+ 27. Kg2 f5 {Black is trying to get one of his rooks onto the side to enable mate.} 28. Qxb5 {! If black moves his rook on f7 forward then QxR and then the rook must move back to prevent mate.} Re7 {Black moves the other rook.  White has just bought some time.} 29. Rfd1 {White goes on the attack and also clears an escape path for his King.} Rf6 {Black is impatient} 30. Rd8+ {White attacks trying to get and keep the initiative.} Kf7 31. Qb8 {If instead, 31 R-d7 to offer a rook exchange and put further pressure on Black's King.} Rg6+ {Black goes on the attack now he has the initiave.} 32. Kf1 {white retreats to avoid mate} Qc4+ 33. Ke1 Rg1+ 34. Kd2 Rxb1 35. Qxb1 {White now has a relatively free King and the queen is close by to offer protection.  White's free pawn on c3 will be hard to protect and his king side is very weak with two pawns on one file only.} Qf4+ 36. Ke2 g5 {Black starts his pawn push but perhaps with the wrong pawn?.  His pawn on h8 has no barrier - it just needs a rook behind it.} 37. Rd4 Qh2 38. c4 {white tries to advance his pawn too.} h5 {here comes that pawn now.} 39. c5 g4 40. fxg4 {If white does not take the pawn now then 40 ... p-g3 ! and black can gain another queen (since white's pawn on f2 cannot capture black can advance his pawn another space to g2)} hxg4 {? black previously had a passed pawn on the h file - it had a free run to the end but now has to get past a pawn.} 41. Qb3 {white sees the danger of the black pawn on g3} Qh3 42. Qxh3 {white goes for the exchange knowing his rook is nearby.} gxh3 43. Kd3 {?? White should have immediately moved his rook to h4 and taken control over the file so the pawn can be captured.  He is instead concerned about protecting his own passed pawn from black's rook.} Kg6 {! Black opens a way for his rook to take control over the h file and be protected by his king.} 44. Rh4 Rh7 {white must exchange or be a rook down and in check} 45. Rxh7 Kxh7 46. c6 {The race to queen a pawn is on.} h2 47. c7 h1=Q 48. c8=Q {Black has the initiative as he got there a scant move ahead.} Qe4+ 49. Kd2 Qd4+ 50. Ke2 Qb2+ {Black has kept the initiative and wins a pawn for it.} 51. Kf1 Qxa3 52. Qd7+ {White now tries to counter.} Kg6 53. Qxe6+ {and wins a pawn too.} Kg5 54. Qg8+ {White tries to keep the initiative.  With black a pawn up and it is passed, he certainly has a strong advantage.} Kf4 55. Qh7 Qc5 {? Black has the opportunity to advance his pawn and keep it under his queen's protection.  He should be able to use that to force white to exchange his queen for a pawn.} 56. Qh4+ {white takes the initiative back.  At this stage white should be happy if he can get out of this with a draw.} Ke5 57. Qh8+ Ke4 58. Qh4+ f4 {black keeps his pawn moving forward, but it is the other pawn that poses the greater danger and it still hasn't been moved.} 59. Qh7+ Kf3 60. Qh3+ Ke4 61. Qh7+ {! White is trying to get a repetitive check (and a draw)} Qf5 {? Black tries to break the monotony but gives up his pawn advantage!} 62. Qxa7 f3 63. Qe3+ {An interesting situation has developed around two pawns.} Kd5 64. Qd2+ Ke5 65. Qe3+ {White still tries to go for a draw.  The following moves are attempts to jostle for position but don't gain anything.} Qe4 66. Ke1 Kf5 67. Kf1 Qb1+ 68. Qe1 Qd3+ 69. Kg1 Qe4 70. Qxe4+ {When black takes the queen, white has the initiative and 71 K-h2 or 71 K-h1  starts his King moving first but it will still be close.} Kxe4 {The rule in a king and pawn ending is to get your King in front of your pawn (not behind it).  If 71 K-h2 then if black tries to stay behind his pawn he will lose it.  eg 71 ... K-f4  72 K-h3 K-g3 (or g4) and black must move his King away and lose the pawn.  Whereas if 71 ... K-d3 72 K-g3 K-e2 then 73 and white's King must move away and he loses the pawn.  In this case the King that last approaches will win so we will probably end in a draw.} 71. Kf1 {?? Instead of advancing (and allowing a chance to win if Black makes a mistake) White has made a potentially fatal error!  If 71 ... K-d3 then Black can force white's King away and take the pawn and is in an ideal position to queen his own pawn and win the game. At this point white offers the draw and black accepts after which White breathes a huge sign of relief!}
