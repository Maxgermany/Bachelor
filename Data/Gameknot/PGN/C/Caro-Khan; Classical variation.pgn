Bd2 {Preferring this move to 11. Bf4 which can be met with 11. ... Qa5+ by Black with 12. Bd2 Qc7} Ngf6 12. O-O-O Bd6 13. Ne4 {So as to avoid a potential exchange on g3 doubling White's pawns on the g-file} Nxe4 14. Qxe4 Nf6 15. Qe2 Qc7 16. Kb1 O-O-O 17. Ne5 Nd5 18. c4 {Kicking the knight and also asserting White's presence in the centre with ideas of d5 at some juncture} Bxe5 19. dxe5 Nb6 20. c5 Nd5 21. g3 Qe7 22. Rdc1 f6 23. f4 f5 24. b4 {Although the centre isn't strictly closed given the open d-file I thought it worth the risk of advancing the Q-side pawns despite having castled Q-side} a6 25. a4 Kd7 26. b5 axb5 27. axb5 cxb5 28. Qxb5+ {I don't think Black should have been so obliging with pawn exchanges} Kc8 29. c6 bxc6 {Probably best.  If 29. ... b6 then 30. Qa6+ (30. ... Kc7  31. Qb7#) Kb8  31. c7+ Nxc7  32. Qxb6+ Kc8  33. Ba5 Rd7  34. Rc2 with the idea of doubling Rooks with a decisive advantage} 30. Rxc6+ Nc7 {If Black had tried to run with the King, e.g. 30. ...Kd7 then 31. Rc7++ Kxc7  32. Rc1+ is decisive} 31. Ba5 Rd7 32. Rhc1 {Black resigns}
