1. e4 {Notes by Eric Schiller.} d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nxd5 4. Bc4 Nb6 5. Bb3 Nc6 6. Nf3 e5 {A rather brash move, sticking a pawn in the middle of the board with only a single knight as protector. In addition, the bishop at b3 has a clear aim at the vulnerable f7-square.} 7. d3 Bg4 8. h3 Bh5 9. Nxe5 {A brilliant move! A familiar theme, with the twist that Black has greater development than usual when the classic queen sacrifice is used.} Bxd1 10. Bxf7+ Ke7 11. Bg5+ Kd6 12. Ne4+ Kxe5 13. f4+ Kd4 {13... Kf5 is horrible blunder. 14.Ng3#.} 14. Rxd1 {The Black king has been driven to d4, and the extra queen is of no use. The king tries to hide on e3.} Ke3 {14... Qxg5 15.c3+ Ke3 16.fxg5 also wins.} 15. O-O {A good move!} Nd4 {White announced mate in 6.} 16. Rde1+ Ne2+ 17. Rxe2+ Kxe2 18. Bh5+ Ke3 19. Rf3+ Kd4 {19... Ke2 20.Rg3+ Ke1 21.Re3#.} 20. Bf7 {The checkmate will be delivered by the pawns.} Nd5 21. c3+ Nxc3 22. bxc3# {Now, you may well think that this game is cmposed. Especially when my source for the game indicated it was dedicated by Mr. Wellmuth to the late Perrier. The sparkling gem was created in the middle of a World War, when there wasn't time or opportunity serious tournament play, and I'll admit the the other offerings fro that year didn't impress me enough to set this aside, and besides, it doesn't seem to be well known. Actually, it isn't all that complicated, just long. Notice how few branches had to be calculated. A very short computer analysis found the move, but concluded that Black might gain a slight advantage. Of course an exhaustive search would have led the program to the correct conclusion. Even after looking just 7 movesahead, White gained advantage.}
