1. e4 d5 {My usual (will I ever change?).} 2. exd5 {Accepted, which is best for white but much more tactic and complicated to play...} Nf6 {This is recommended instead of Qxd4, which leads to a "hanging queen" that will be easily targeted for white while developing. That's true. I still hold some hopes about the Qa5 or Qe4+ moves, but if more experienced players say they are bad... they probably are. This one seems just to gambit a pawn, because white can assure it by f4.} 3. Bc4 {If 13. f4 instead, black is known to have enough compensation after e6, 14. dxe6, Bxe6, followed by Bb4, Ne4 etc. White will be forced to play defensively. I expected 14. Nc3 or 14. Nf3, which allow e6 (the so-called Icelandic Gambit), a line I am experiencing with. BUT I seldom or never faced this natural move. OF course, I can just take the pawn. But this gets me out of my "confort line". } Nxd5 4. Nf3 {Incredible, but it was the first time I faced this situation. Could I have simply played Nb6? NO!, because of Bxf7+, KxB, Ne4+, with a very strong attack for the piece (still better that what came later). The right move here is Bg4 (now!), prepared to exchange it, or just e6 - provided black manages to develop his lsb on b7 or a6. } Nf4 {?! Counterintuitive, antideveloping, etc. I just thought that normally this move can't be played because white's dsb guards f4, and the white K is castled... but not now. Of course, this move leaves white Bxf7+, KxB, Ne5+... winning, if I remember well some good games from great players in similar positions.  } 5. O-O {White goes for the easy way. I have to stop WN jump, and I don't like f6 at all. At the same time, I was considering what would be needed to make of h3 a sac point, either for N or B. When returning into the game} Bg4 {?? Now I can clearly see it, as I did when analyzing the position. Then, I re-opened the board and played mechanically. After the move, I realized what had I done, and... paid for the consecuences. } 6. Bxf7+ {By the B move I just offered white another piece to munch after the N check. Kd7 is useless too because of Ne5+...} Kxf7 7. Ne5+ Kg8 {Could Ke8 or Kf6 be better?} 8. Qxg4 {The problem for black is to prevent Qe6#... and the N is hanging!} Qd4 {Fearing f3, planning Nh6+. Against any answer, QxN.} 9. Qf5 {Threatening the N and Qf7#, but allowing Ne2+. But this check is useless. Let's make room for my K. } h6 {? Allowing shortly ahead Ng6. } 10. Nc3 {Passive, but in this situation, for white almost any move is good! This forbids Ne2+, but for black there are more urgent issues to assess. I would have gone f3 instead, followed by N4. True is that after Ne2+, Kh1, NxB, RxN, White loses his dsb but still has a better position. } e6 {Now that my K has an escape square, I can play this tricky move. It accomplishes a lot of things: forces white into react instead of attacking (Qf7+, Kh7, and...?). Opens the way for the dsb. Cuts white's support of d7 (so my N can came out). About countermoves: if Nb5, Qb6, QxN, QxN. } 11. Qf7+ {"As you wish, Sir..."} Kh7 12. d3 {Nf3 could go now e4-f6#. I thought that the "natural" Nd5 just loses to Ng6 or Qxe6, so I had to find something else: } Bd6 {The plan is to recover my N with his, unravel a little my pieces, and force white away. If 13. Be3, QxN.} 13. Bxf4 {(Unprocessed saved lines during the game)  h8-f8 14.	f7-e6	f8-f4 15.	e6-g6+	h7-g8 16.	g6-e8+	f4-f8 17.	e8-e6+	g8-h7 18.	e5-g6	f8-f6 19.	e6-c8	f6-g6 20.	c8-b7	c7-c6 21.	c3-e4	d4-d5 22.	f2-f3	d5-h5 23.	g2-g3	d6-c5+ 24.	e4-c5	h5-c5+ 25.	g1-h1	c5-h5 26.	f1-f2   h8-f8 14.	f7-e6	f8-f4 15.	e6-g6+	h7-g8 16.	g6-e8+	f4-f8 17.	e8-e6+	g8-h7 18.	e5-g6	f8-f6 19.	e6-c8	f6-g6 20.	c8-b7	c7-c6 21.	c3-e4	d4-d5 22.	f2-f3	d5-h5 23.	g2-g3	d6-e5 24.	c2-c3	e5-f4 25.	a1-e1	h5-h3 26.	f1-f2	b8-d7 27.	g1-h1	f4-g3 28.	e4-g3	g6-g3 29.	b7-a8	g3-f3 30.	f2-f3	h3-f3+ 31.	h1-g1	d7-f6 32.	a8-a7	f6-g4 33.	e1-e7	f3-d1+ 34.	g1-g2	d1-d2+ 35.	g2-h3	d2-g5 } Rf8 {?? I thought I was making the most of my poor forces, and dreamed to get a powerful counterattack. This was the second tactic I missed. } 14. Qg6+ {!} Kh8 15. Nf7+ {! Not only I won't recover the piece, but I will have to lose the exchange in order to survive (Kg8, Nxh6+, and white wins as he wants). } Rxf7 16. Bxd6 {! Leaving me without my best placed piece, and there is nothing I can do to recover my minor piece dued, since Rd7 doesn't save the R against Qe8+... QxR.} Rxf2 {...but can I still grab a pawn and get an interesting pin.} 17. Rxf2 {Now I should have recovered the piece, but if I do cxB (possible since Rf2 is pinned), but white will take e6, and I will have at most a losing endgame. } Nc6 {Better to cover the 8th rank and get two pieces more into the action!} 18. Bxc7 {Another "lost tempo" by white...} e5 {Blocking the B's action, and "defending" my hanging e6 pawn.} 19. Qe4 {Trying to provoke the Q''s exchange, after which I'm lost. } Qc5 {Still defending e5, but fearing Na5. Could I released white from the pin?} 20. Raf1 {I still have Rf1 here,m making the most of my weak position.} b5 {?? I just thought to prevent Na5. White's threats are too much to cover them all. All I can do is making his win a little harder. If 28... Rf1, 29. Na5 and I lose more material. } 21. Kh1 {Released the pin, I am at a very short distance from Rf8+ and mate. } Rg8 {Making things harder for white. I can't move the N or Bxe4. Maybe Re8 could have been better. } 22. Rf2f5 {I can admit my mistake, and go Re8, but again, it seems only a meaningless resistance, after the material disadvantage. } Nd4 {? Using my last piece, but what else?} 23. Bxe5 {! The B in e5 whorts more than the exchange. Nxc2 was useless, so...} Nxf5 24. Rxf5 Qb6 {Prevening Bxg7+ and RxQ.} 25. Nd5 Qb7 {Preventing Ne7. } 26. Rh5 {Threatening Rxh6.} Qa6 {Preventing Rxh6.} 27. Ne7 {The feared one.} Rf8 {The last useless hop: Ng6? QxN, QxQ, Rf1#. But my opponent is not so naive.} 28. h3 {I wonder (but I'll let my opponent to find out) a better move for white. This is enough...} Rf7 {What else?} 29. Ng6+ Kg8 {Incredibly enough, it doesn't came to the eye a mate combination for white. Is there one?} 30. g4 {This is a three-move attack: g5, gxh6 are two tempoes, so...} Qxa2 {Now I am the one threating mate. Unless white finds a mating seguence right now. An he does!} 31. Qa8+ Kh7 32. Rxh6+ {I saw some lines after KxR, and I found mate. The other option leads to it straight forward. } gxh6 33. Qh8+ Kxg6 34. Qg8+ Rg7 35. Qxg7# {Not a game to be proud of. My head is not at chess when worrying how to get to pay the rent. Still, I hope you had some good laughts reviewing it. A good deserved victory for my opponent. Good for him!}
