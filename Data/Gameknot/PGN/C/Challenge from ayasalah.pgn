1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. e5 {not what I expect.  Q take, knight scare etc.} Qa5+ 4. Bd2 Qxe5+ {I'm not above breaking principles myself} 5. Be2 d3 6. Nf3 Qxe2+ 7. Qxe2 dxe2 8. Nc3 Nf6 9. Kxe2 {looked like the knight was planning on taking the wee torrent pawn and then K could castle to safety} Nc6 10. Nb5 Nd5 11. c4 a6 12. Nbd4 {should take it.  black really has it now} Nxd4+ 13. Nxd4 Nf6 14. b4 e5 15. Nf5 Ne4 16. Be3 Nc3+ 17. Kd2 Bxb4 {ahh development} 18. Kc2 d5 19. a3 Bxf5+ {development and check.  better and better} 20. Kb3 dxc4+ 21. Kxb4 {good choice on his part} Nd5+ 22. Kxc4 Nxe3+ 23. fxe3 Rc8+ 24.
