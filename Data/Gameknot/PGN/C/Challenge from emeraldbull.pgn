1. d4 {I am Black. I like this game because it was one of the fastest games ever.} c5 {The Benoni Defense is referred to as a defense because White still has the first-move initiative, but the Benoni is rather a counterattack, I challenge White's pawn immidiately.} 2. dxc5 {Not the best move. Here, White gives up a centre pawn for a pawn a file away from the centre. The most agressive alternative is 2.d5, the safest is 2.c3, and the most drawish moves are 2.e3 or the better 2.Nf3.} e6 {I am going to win back my pawn and have an extra central pawn. After Bxc5 and Nc6, I will have good control of the dark central squares and I can use my extra central pawn by playing Ne7 then d5, resulting in a sharp dynamic battle favoring Black.} 3. b4 {A bad move. White tries to hold onto his extra pawn here, but I quickly exploit him.} a5 {I strike the defender of the c5 pawn.} 4. c3 {Taking the pawn is better because after I take back with the rook and get the c5 pawn, I will only have a small advantage.} axb4 5. cxb4 {5. cxb4?? A losing blunder. It was White's last chance to give back the pawn and accept a disadvantage, but now his greediness will lose the game.} Qf6 {White resigned. He cannot defend the rook, and must sacrifice a minor piece to avoid losing it. White did not want to play on down a piece with overextended queenside pawns and lacking in development.}
