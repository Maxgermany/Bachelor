1. e4 {{C38: King's Gambit Accepted: 3 Nf3 g5 4 Bc4 Bg7} This is not a standard annotation, it is just Fritz's analysis of variations copied and pasted (my brief comments are those not in parenthesis).  At the beginning of every relevant move a number is given by Fritz which indicates who is winning in terms of pawns, positive for white and negative for black. It is only intended to allow Luckpawn and I to have a look at our game and see where we went wrong tactically - so if you could refrain from giving it a bad rating then that would be great, thanks.  ;) The threshold for blunders was set at 1 pawn (i.e moves that lose the equivalent of 1 or more pawns have variations suggested). } e5 2. f4 exf4 3.

I had looked at the queen sacrifice for quite a while and thought it looked promising but for some reason I completely overlooked what should have been the easiest move of the combination! } Rh7 15. c3 {(-2.25)  Nxe5 was much better.} Bg4 16.
