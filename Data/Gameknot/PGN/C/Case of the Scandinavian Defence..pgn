[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 {The most common opening that has an uncountable amount of variations.} d5 {As I increase in rank, I find the Scandinavian more often for some reason.} 2. exd5 {I take, what other choices do I have?} Qxd5 {So far, so good.} 3. Nc3 {After this move, I can tell that Black is power hungry because of his next move.} Qe6+ {?! Two problems; 1.I am perfectly safe with 4.Be2; and 2. 3...Qa5 would prevent much development issues.} 4. Be2 {Well, I had other moves, but this was probably better for development.} Qf6 {Okay, never mind. Black did NOT play the Scandinavian correctly. I call this the "corrupt-able one piece power".} 5. Nd5 {Black is already getting into trouble after the difficult-to-play 4...Qf6, blocking in his snoozing back rank pieces. Black must carefully select his next move, as one move protects and the other move loses severely.} Qc6 {An undeniable error! 5...Qd6 was significantly better.} 6. Bb5 {! Loses the Queen and Black has three deadly options. #1. 6...Kd7 or Kd8 7.Bxc3+bxc3 8.Nc3. #2. 6...Be7?? 7.Bxc6 getting the Rook no matter what. #3. Qxb5 Nxc7+ garnering the Queen. Black is officially losing.} Qxb5 {Smart choice to do this move. } 7. Nxc7+ {two forced options that expose the King (slightly exposed if 7...Kd8).} Kd8 {Expected.} 8. Nxb5 g6 {With seven points up, I decide to not retreat the Knight yet, but continue with the advantage I created.} 9. d4 {Helps develope the Bishop.} Na6 {Is it just me, or does Black want to guarantee weak pieces?} 10. Nf3 {I continue development.} Bg7 {Why didn't he do 8...e6 instead of 8...g6?} 11. Ne5 {I don't necessarily like this move. Perhaps Castling Kingside was better.} Ke8 {Now, I can play out 12.Qf3.} 12. Qf3 {Black is on his way to losing valley.He can only protect against two out of three intentions I have for the Queen. the intentions are Qxb7 (if possible), Qxf7, and Qd5 (perhaps the least smartest move).} Nb4 {I ignore this Knight because my win is much faster.} 13. Qxf7+ {I continue with what Black wasn't protecting.} Kd8 {Black's King is a broken playground.} 14. Qxg7 {What you just witnessed is a setup for potential checkmate. } Nxc2+ {? I expected that, but for the first time in all of my games, this move doesn't make my position weaken at all.} 15. Kd2 {Now, Black is lost undoubtfully and will have to give up his Knight to play the gloomy 15...Bd7, his only best move.} Bf5 {Instead, he wants to protect the Knight and lose in one move.} 16. Qf8# {I hope you took note of how much better 15...Bd7 was compared to 15...Bf5. In fact, I believe that ...Bd7 could have been played earlier. Black's problems arose by his option of letting his Queen get pinned and lost to protect a less valuable piece. Had Black play more carefully and watched out for my intentions and plans, he could have had a good game.}
