Qxe6+ Qe7 31. Qc6+ Qd7 32. Qxc5 Rb5 {The beginning of the end. 32....... Rc8 much better as once the queen moves you can safely extract the knight to c2 which puts you up a rook verses 3 extra pawns by white. No need to fear 33.Qxd5 as QxQ, RxQ still gives you Kc2. If 33.Rxd5 then Black replies RxQ 34.RxQ, KxR, 36.BxN, Rc1 and you capture the bishop next.} 33. Qc3 Nxb3 34. axb3 Kd8 35. Ba3 Rf7 36. h4 Qc8 37. Qe5 Qc6 38. Rc1 Qf6 39. Qc3 Qxc3 40. Rxc3 a5 41. Kg2 Rc7 42. Rxc7 Kxc7 43. Bb2 Rb6 {He has a hung pawn at b3. Take it and then you have an outside passed pawn at a5. } 44. Bc3 Ra6 45. Kf3 Kd6 46. Kf4 Ke6 47. h5 a4 48. bxa4 Rxa4+ 49.

Kxd5, Rxh5  Still tough to win as he has two passed pawns but not two connected pawns as before.} 58. Kg6 Rf7 59. h6 Rb7 60. Kh5 Rf7 61. g6 Rg7 62. Bxg7 {Have to say you lost the game back at 32 and or 57. Thats where you could of made a diffrence in the game.}
