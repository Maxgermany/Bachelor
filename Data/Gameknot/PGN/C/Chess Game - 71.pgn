1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Nd7 {Neither this nor my third move are the most common, but I had taken a look at them and I must say that on the whole I like Black's position. } 6. Bf4 {!? This seems like a novelty, but it is also a logical one, preventing e5. Additionally, I guess it serves Moros style well. } g6 {(6... e5? 7. Nxe5 Qf6 8. Nxd7 Qxb2 ? (8... Bxd7 9. Qc1 White has a moderate advantage) 9. Be5 ! White has a decisive advantage) } 7. Qc1 {The logical follow-up. } Bg7 {?! I decided to play a bit unusually as well for a change, but it will give me some problems. It was more in the spirit of the position to play. (7... h6 {with good chances of obtaining a type of position like in the variation 3.. .g6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 and a normal game.}) } 8. Bh6 Qa5+ {!} 9. c3 Ne5 {The point of my play. However, I had evaluated the arising type of position mistakenly. } 10. Nxe5 Bxe5 11. Nd2 Qa6 {Slightly strange and eventually the queen will feel uncomfortable here, but I wanted to avoid. (11... Be6 12. Nb3 Qb5 (12... Qb6 13. Be3 Bxb3 14. axb3 White has a slight advantage) 13. c4 Qb6 14. Be3 { Probably without reason, as vermeiden. Vermutlich grundlos, denn} Rd8 { gives me certain play for a pawn, even if probably not enough.}) } 12. Qc2 Be6 13. f4 {(13. Nf3 Bc7 14. Ng5 O-O-O (14... Bd7 15. Qb3 White has a moderate advantage) 15. Nxe6 fxe6 { is ok for Black due to the pressure on d3.}) } Bc7 14. O-O f6 {I felt that I had to provide my bishop with a square on f7 after a possible f4-f5. } 15. c4 {!} O-O-O 16. a4 {! Here I finally realised what my oppenent was up to, but I still felt that the upcoming complications should be ok for me. } Rd7 {Actually, this seems like the best chance, as (16... Ba5 17. Nb3 Bb4 18. a5 { is fairly cheerless, with the queen totally out of play.}) } 17. a5 Rhd8 18. Ra3 Bxa5 {!? A terribly risky move, not even the engines prefer this! However, I calculated the variations, and it seemed to me that Black would eventually be fine. } 19. f5 {A good move, it is useful to include Bh6 in the game. } Bf7 20. fxg6 {(20. Nb3 Rxd3 21. Nxc5 (21. Rxa5 {gives nothing:} Qxc4 22. Qxc4 Bxc4 23. Nxc5 Rd1 24. Rxd1 Rxd1+ 25. Kf2 b6 26. Ra4 Bb5 27. Rxa7 bxc5 28. Rxe7 gxf5 29. exf5 Rf1+ 30. Kg3 Rxf5 31. Rxh7 Rh5 ! equal chances, quiet position) 21... Bb6 (21... Qxc4 22. Qxc4 Bxc4 23. Nxd3 Bb6+ 24. Nf2 Bxf1 25. Kxf1 White has a moderate advantage) (21... Qb6 22. Rxa5 (22. Rxd3 Rxd3 23. Qxd3 Qxc5+ White has sufficient compensation for material deficit) 22... R3d4 23. Qb3 (23. Rfa1 Rxc4 24. Qf2 Qxa5 !)) 22. Rxa6 Bxc5+ 23. Kh1 bxa6 {with play similar to the game, although after} 24. b3 ! { White probably has a slighlty better version, and he should maybe have gone for it.}) } hxg6 21. e5 Be6 {(21... Qb6 22. Rfa1 Bb4 23. Rxa7 {is not great for Black. Instead, the idea of Be6 is very clear: Put the bishop on f5 and activity at any cost!}) } 22. exf6 exf6 23. Nb3 {(23. Rxf6 Bf5 unclear position) } Rd7xd3 24. Nxc5 Bb6 {(24... Qb6 25. Rxa5 Qxa5 26. Nxe6 White has a decisive advantage) (24... Qxc4 25. Qxc4 Bxc4 26. Nxd3 Bb6+ 27. Nf2 Bxf1 28. Kxf1 White has a decisive advantage)   } 25. Rxa6 {(25. Rxd3 Bxc5+ 26. Kh1 Bd4 !? { I was actually more worried about Rxd3 than the game continuation, but I eventually found this continuation, and even if I still was not too sure about it, it seemed to me that I would survive.} (26... Rxd3 { Is the obvious continuation Die offensichtliche Fortsetzung.} 27. Qxd3 Bxc4 28. Qh3+ f5 29. Re1 unclear position {But my king did not feel too safe here...}) 27. Rxd4 (27. b3 Bf5 Black has a slight advantage) 27... Rxd4 28. Qxg6 Qxc4 29. Qxf6 Rd8 unclear position) } Bxc5+ 26. Kh1 bxa6 {During the game I was totally convinced that I was fine here, with my active pieces, however, White probably has a forced continuation leading to a better game for him even if Black has counterchances. } 27. Bg7 {?? Too careless, and meeting a surprising refutation. (27. b4 ! Bb6 (27... Bxb4 28. Qa4) 28. Qe2 {I did not see this move, which turns out to be quite strong, and the only which poses Black any problems.} Bf7 (28... Bf5 29. g4 !) (28... Bxc4 ? 29. Qg4+) 29. Qe4 (29. Bg7 f5 30. c5 Bc7 31. Bf6 R8d7 unclear position) 29... Kb7 30. b5 axb5 31. cxb5 Bd5 32. Qe7+ (32. bxc6+ Bxc6 33. Qxg6 Rd1 White has moderate counterplay) 32... Ka8 33. bxc6 Bxc6 34. Qxf6) } Bg4 {! Surprisingly enough, after this there is no way to defend against Rd1. } 28. b4 {(28. h3 Rd1 29. Rxd1 Rxd1+ 30. Kh2 Bd6+ 31. g3 Bf3 ! Black has a decisive advantage) (28. Qa4 Rd1 !? 29. Qxc6+ Kb8 30. Qxf6 Rxf1+ 31. Qxf1 Rd1 Black has a decisive advantage) } Be3 {(28... Bxb4 29. Qa4 Rd1 30. Qxc6+ Kb8 31. Rg1 {is amazingly enough not so clear.}) (28... Rd1 29. Rxd1 Rxd1+ 30. Qxd1 Bxd1 31. bxc5 f5 {is probably won too, but more complicated.}) } 29. h3 Rd3d1 30. Rxd1 Rxd1+ 31. Kh2 Bf4+ 32. g3 Rd2+ {I had somehow overlooked that I could not play (32... Bf3 ?? 33. gxf4 { and the king gets the g3 square! But the game continuation wins easily enough.} ) } 33. Qxd2 Bxd2 34. hxg4 Bxb4 {?! Here I played too fast, right after I had made this move, I saw that I could have won much easier: (34... c5 35. bxc5 Bg5 36. Bf8 a5 37. c6 Bc1 { and White will have to give up the bishop for the a-pawn.}) } 35. Bxf6 a5 36. Kg2 Kd7 37. Kf3 Bd6 {!} 38. Ke4 Bxg3 39. Kd3 Ke6 40. Bd4 a6 41. Kc2 a4 42. Kb1 Be5 43. Bf2 Kd6 44.
