1. e4 c6 {I try the caro kahn. Do not know much about the opening, so that I'll look at the gameknot database.} 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 {The most common line} 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. Be2 e6 8. c5 Be7 {Preparing the castle} 9. O-O {White king in safety} O-O {Black castle as well.} 10. a3 {To prevent 10. ... Nb4 and enable b4} a6 {To prevent Bb5} 11. b4 {Developping the queenside} Bf5 {I felt a bit cramped, so that I prefered to lose a tempo to prepare 12. ... Ne4. an d try to get control of the center, for I didn't find any possibility to attack the queenside} 12. Nh4 {menacing black LSB and freeing the d1h5 diagonal for the white one} Ne4 {carrying on the plan. If 13. Nxf5 Nxc3, menacing the queen} 13. Nxe4 {white opts for a trade} Bxe4 {White's h knight is under menace} 14. Nf3 {black is under the menace of 15. b4 axb5 16. Bxb5} Bf6 {white's weak pawn is the d4 one and this move prepares e5.} 15. Be3 {White opts to protect his pawn rather than to attack on the queenside.} Re8 {preparing e5} 16. h3 {I do not understand this move.} e5 {finaly playing e5} 17. dxe5 Bxe5 {Material equality, Black is better on the center, white's pawn structure is stronger, both kings are safe, nobody controls the open file, both kings are safe. The situation is equilibrated. Black has the initiative.} 18. Nxe5 {eliminating the threat on the a rook} Rxe5 19. Bd3 {contesting the center} Bxd3 {trading} 20. Qxd3 Rh5 {This move had 3 goals : permit 21. ... Ne5, quitting the e5 square which would be hard to keep in front of an attack of the DSB and surprise white (until now I didin't find any opportunity to get a decisive advantage} 21. Bf4 {preventing 21. Ne5...} Ne5 {... which black plays anyway but the price to pay will be higher} 22. Bxe5 {trading} Rxe5 {Now black controls the open file, is better on the center but has an inferior pawn structure. The situation is equilibrated.} 23. Rae1 {contesting the e file.} Rxe1 {Maybe a mistake. 23. Qe7 might have been better.} 24. Rxe1 {Now white controls the open file} Qd7 {To enable 25. ... Re8 or 25. ... Rd8} 25. Re5 Rd8 26. Kf1 {I'm not sure about this move.} f6 {Opening the king's diagonal is dangerous but white has no LSB anylonger and I had no better idea.} 27. Re3 {white has to drawback} d4 {advzncing the passed pawn} 28. Qc4+ Qf7 {proposing a trade} 29. Qxf7+ {trading} Kxf7 {no choice} 30. Rd3 {white has to withdraw and black has the initiative but the situation is equal and I couldn't see any serious attacking possibility for either side. We were heading for a draw.} Ke6 {There are still many pawns on the board but only one rook left each, time to send the king on the center.} 31. Ke2 {It seems that white has the same thought} Kd5 {The passed pawn is black's main advantage. I do not want to lose it and I would like to send the rook in mission} 32. Kd2 {Hiding the king} Re8 {occupying the open file} 33. Rg3 g6 34. Rf3 f5 {Some manoeuvres} 35. h4 {After having force the black pawns to advance, white launches an attack} Re4 {At this point I offered a draw, not seein any way to force the decision on either side. My opponent refused...} 36. g3 {... because he has an idea of attack} h6 {To defend the left wing} 37. h5 {Clever attack. I oversaw this move. Black could quickly be in trouble.} Ke5 {king to rescue} 38. hxg6 {Now white's pawn structure is better than black's who has 3 unsupported pawns but black still has his passed pawn and king on central position} Rg4 {The other candidate move would have been 38. ... Kf6 but the king has to stay near the passed pawn} 39. b5 {White plays on both sides, presumably hoping that black won't be able to protect all the board with one rook.} Rxg6 {Only way to have the rook ready to protect the right wing} 40. a4 {I was expecting 40. c6 bxc6 41. bxa6.  or 41.b6. Black could hardly have saved the situation by 41. ... Rg8} h5 {Not very good : to prevent 41 g4 Rxg4 42. Rf7 which was not that dangerous} 41. Rb3 {Strenghtening the attack on the queen side where white has a majority} Kd5 {Advantage of having the king on the center : it can come and strengten the little soldiers.} 42. bxa6 Rxa6 {42. ... bxa6 was the other candidate move but I thought that 42. Rxa6 would permit an attack with the rook on the queenside, menacing the white king so that the passed pawn could advance.} 43. Rxb7 {White trades} Rxa4 {eliminating the queenside menace} 44. Rf7 {White strategy is to eliminate as many pawns as possible to get material superiority.} Ra2+ {To force the white king to retreat (if 45. Kd3 Ra3)} 45. Ke1 Kxc5 {eliminating the last white pawn on the right wing.} 46. Rxf5+ Kc4 {The black king had to go there anyway} 47. Rxh5 {At this moment, I thought that the heroic d pawn who needed only 3 more steps to be promoted  as general was dangerous enough to compensate the late in material and that, if no one made a mistake, we were heading for a draw} d3 {White carries on his plan} 48. Rh8 {I hoped that white would try to defend his pawns with rook on h1, h2 or h3, thus masking it but my opponent is too carefull for such a mistake.} Re2+ {To send the white king as far as possible from the d pawn.} 49. Kf1 {If 49. Kd1 Rxf2} Kc3 {To have a chance to win, the black king has to be behind the pawn or the rook (else, white can give chess with his rook)} 50. g4 {The white pawn is still 4 paces away from the paradise} Re5 {If 50. ... Kd2, the black d pawn is blocked, if 50. ... d2 51. Kxe2, so that the rook has to be send fr away from the king} 51. f4 {Agressive move but black had anticipated} Re4 {The rook stays on the e file (to block the white king) and menaces the pawns.} 52. Rc8+ {forcing the king to block the d pawn.} Kd2 {52. ... Kb2 might have been better but I was afraid of 53. Rb8+ Kc2 54. Rc8+ Kd1 and the king could have been blocked by the white rook with 55. Ra8 and 56. Ra1+ but I am probably wrong for 56. ... Kc2 I didn't wangt to take the risk and prefered to secure the draw.} 53. Rf8 Ke3 { Now, the draw is in black's pocket. I hoped for a mistake from white to have the win... } 54. Ke1 {... but white's too Wise for it and plays the proper move. } Kf3+ {54. d2+ was another candidate move but I thought that white was more likely to do a mistake with Kf3 (i.e. sending the king on f1), though I had little hope because my opponent plaid too carefully during the whole game.} 55. Kd2 {Well plaid.} Rxf4 {Now, the draw is unavoidable} 56. Rxf4+ {At this point, white proposes a draw, accepted. I add the next two moves.} Kxf4 57. Kxd3 Kxg4 {Thanks to kwaster for this interresting game. The attack begun on move 37 was really good, leading to an fun edged to edged situation.}
