[Opening "KP (C20), Napoleon's opening"]

1. e4 {KP open} e5 {typical response} 2. Qf3 {Q out so early on the second move, and unprovoked...why?  This is the primary reason for a CM is 6 moves...  I guess this is called the Napoleon's opening.} Nf6 {development} 3. g4 {not sure why...} d5 {black reverse scotch opening to open the middle up, and allow the opportunity to develop my WB} 4. d3 {passive move} Bxg4 {threaten Q while developing WB, also saw a longshot opportunity that did come true 2 moves later} 5. Qg3 {good move i thought} dxe4 {open middle, pawn swap} 6. dxe4 {why, should have checked with a Qxe5 ; just another bad move, really not too surprised.} Qd1# {CHECKMATE!  almost too easy...  Typical outcome for anyone who decides to bring the Q out on move #2.}
