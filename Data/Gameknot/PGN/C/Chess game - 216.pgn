1. e4 {I play e4. I am looking forward to playing aggressive for example danish gambit. The game is only 5minutes for each so we are playing with a lot of mistakes. But this game shows how bad it is to be too greedy or materialistic...} e5 {E5} 2. d4 {D4 - good looking move :)} f6 {He plays f6. I can't remember playing against f6 but it seems to be interesting.} 3. Nf3 {Nf3- attacking} Nh6 {I don't understand why he played this move! Can anyone tell me what intentions he could have had?} 4. Bc4 {Bc4 Allowing myself to castle king side and also bishop is on a very important line. But maybe i should have sacrificed my knight playing Nxe5 fxe5; Bxh6 gxh6; Qh6+ Ke7; Qxe5+ wining a rock and opponent's king would be in the middle of the board.  I believe that it would have been better move than Bc4 because my opponent was greedy enough to fall in the trap.} d6 {So, he plays d6 - a good move. Don't agree? than write your comments and explain.} 5. O-O {I played 0-0 thinking about the safety, but actually i wanted to play more aggressively.} Bg4 {Bg4- hate this move! :(} 6. c3 {C3- i was thinking about Qb3 but this move also defends d4 :)} Qd7 {Qd7 and all my plans disappeared. I had planed to sacrifice my bishop or something but now it wouldn't matter.} 7. dxe5 {dxe5-trying to open the d file} fxe5 {fxe5 still fighting for center...} 8. Qd3 {Qd3 getting of the hook :D} Nc6 {Ncs - developing} 9. Bb5 {Bb5 i wanted him to make a6 and..} a6 {a6  :)} 10. Ba4 b5 11. Bb3 {Ba4 b5; Bb3 - it must be interesting} Be6 {Be6 - defending the d5 square} 12. Bxh6 gxh6 {Bxh6 gxhs - just for fun ;) } 13. Rd1 {Rd1 a developing move and somehow hoping to win the Queen} O-O-O {0-0-0  it's the beginning of the end.} 14. a4 {a4! a stupid move - because it loses a piece. But as opponent had only 1 minute left, it was worth trying.} Bxb3 {Bxb3 i hope this won't end as a nightmare for me.} 15. axb5 {axb5 on the cutting edge} Bxd1 {Bxd1 and my opponent thinks that b5 pawn is to weak to cause problems.} 16. bxa6 {bxa6 - a bit shocking move for him. Now he stops to think. He takes his time...} Bxf3 {Bxf3 - still trying to grasp everything he can.} 17. a7 {And a7 - i hope he will take it... } Nxa7 {Nxa7 He was winning but too greedy..} 18. Qa6+ {Qa6+ finishing the game} Kb8 {Kb8 the only move} 19. Qxa7+ {Qxa7+} Kc8 20. Qa8# {Kc8; Qa8# and he had had only 3 seconds left. But the game was interesting enough to show you folks. Thanks for watching :)}
