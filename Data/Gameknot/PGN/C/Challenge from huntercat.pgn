1. d4 e6 2. e4 Bb4+ 3. Bd2 Bd6 4. e5 Be7 5. Nc3 g5 6. Nf3 h6 7. Bb5 c6 8. Bc4 d5 9. Bd3 Qb6 10. O-O f6 11. exf6 Nxf6 {Exchange of pawns} 12. Bg6+ Kd8 13. Ne5 Rf8 14. Be3 Qxb2 15. Na4 {Threatening the queen} Qa3 16. Nc5 Ne4 17. Nf7+ Kc7 18. Nxe4 Nd7 {Trying to force an exchange of knights, but Black doesn't take my knight. } 19. Nc5 b6 20. Nxe6+ {Taking the pawn and pinning the rook.} Kb8 21. Nxf8 {Taking the rook.} Bxf8 22. Bc1 {Threatening the queen.} Qc3 23. Be3 Nf6 24. Ne5 Ng4 25. Nxg4 Bxg4 {Exchange of knights. This exchange also gave me an extra bishop. } 26. Qxg4 Kb7 {I think that Black was trying to get the rook out into the action.} 27. Qd7+ {This move begins my forced checkmate.} Ka6 28. Bd3+ b5 29. a4 Ba3 {Black is trying to block my rook's path to the king.} 30. axb5+ {Checking the king with my pawn supported by my bishop.} Ka5 {Perhaps a better move for Black would have been Kb6, which would have helped him to avoid mate. If Black had done Kb6 here instead, I would have done Qxc6+, which would have basically forced Black to take my queen with his own, and then I would have taken the queen with my pawn. Black would probably have then either taken my pawn with the king, in which case I would have captured the bishop with my rook, or moved the bishop out of harm's way, in which case I would have moved my rook to a6 to check the king again,. Even so, I have played through that outcome and although I am still able to checkmate, it takes an additional few moves, and since I'm not sure how Black would have responded to some of them, the game might not have ended so quickly. } 31. Qc7+ Kb4 {Perhaps it would have been better for black to move to a4 instead, as that helps him to avoid checkmate. My next move, checking the king with my f-column rook, is kind of essential to block the king's escape square on b4, and if the king hadn't already been on b4, it wouldn't have been a check and Black would have been able to force an exchange of queens in order to escape mate.} 32. Rfb1+ Bb2 {Perhaps a better move for Black here would have been Ka4. That way, I wouldn't have been able to move my queen to a5 and mate, because he could have taken the queen and it wouldn't have had support from my rook, due to the bishop blocking it. } 33. Qa5# {}
