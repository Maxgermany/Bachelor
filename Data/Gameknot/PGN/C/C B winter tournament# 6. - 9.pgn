1. c4 {English. or transposition? hmmm.} Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 {Reversed Sicilian. interesting choices.} 3. d4 {normal are Nf3 or g3. } exd4 4. Nb5 c5 {very interesting. Classical Chess: Hold the center with pawns. White must seek an answer to ...a6 pushing the N to a3 and minimal center influence. } 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. e3 {good move is 6.e3, fighting against that dominating central presence. } Be7 {6....a6 has to be better. } 7. Bd3 {exd first, then this move of the Bishop. } dxe3 8. Bxe3 a6 9. Nc3 {White's N is much better here than on a3. More options for movement and more center influence. } d6 {9....d5 is better. this leaves a pawn on a half-open file and behind the nearby pawns. thus subject to attack and pressure. better to advance and swap it for the c4 button, leaving Black with a potential passer on the Q-side. } 10. h3 h6 {preventing ...Bg4. is this necessary? I dunno. Not a bad move, though. } 11. Nd2 O-O 12. g4 {interesting choice. Black has castled. now White is declaring: "King Side Pawn Charge" but has not secured his own king. While I would prefer to be the side attacking, Black has made no obviously bad or weakening moves. This early aggression is probably not called for. Maybe  O-O would be better first. then Kh1, f4, Rf2, g4, Rg1 (i.e., Student Body Left!)... } Ne5 13. Be2 {Interesting choice to save the B. Qe2, Nxd3+ and Qxd3 are to be considered. then O-O-O becomes a very interesting option. } Qd7 {this Q-move must be given a "?" as ...d5 is much stronger. After this move, 14.f4! will continue the advertised pawn charge. } 14. Na4 {hmmm. most of the time, we cannot successfully expand on both sides of the board. 14....Bd8, ...Qc6 and ...b5! stops the fork threat. in re-evaluation, Nb6 can be ignored for a few moves as White has a rook on h1 that is unprotected. } Qc6 15. f3 {O-O may be stronger. } b5 {15.d5 appears to be stronger. } 16. cxb5 axb5 17. Nc3 c4 {17....b4 may be slightly better.} 18. Rf1 {This move must be given a "?" as a3 prevents Black's next move. White appears to be in deep trouble at present.} Nd3+ {...b4 first pushing the N to somewhere else!  However, Black is still in the better position.} 19. Bxd3 cxd3 20. Rc1 Qc7 {20....Nd5 is better. Why give up the b button which you have fought so hard to get up the board?} 21. Nxb5 Qb8 22. a4 Nd5 23. Bd4 {23.Nc4 is better. now, ...Bh4+, 24.Bf2 Re8+ give Black a significant edge. and a little further checking provides for: ...Bh4+ 24.Bf2 Bg5 25.Rc4 Re8+ 26.Re4 Bb7! and White's position will soon crumble. } Re8 {misses the tactically correct move. } 24. Ne4 {appears to be the best move available. } Nb4 {Misses ...Bd7, attacking the advanced developed N. } 25. Rc4 {Misses Nc7 forking the Rooks.  Rc4 walks into the pawn fork ...d5...} d5 26. Nc7 Nc2+ {misses ...dxc4, but this is not a bad move. } 27. Rxc2 dxc2 28. Qxc2 Bh4+ {...Bb4+ as an alternative. not worse, just different. } 29. Kd1 Ba6 {29....dxe4 is better.} 30. Nd6 {30...Nxa6 is better.} Be2+ 31. Kc1 {31....Qb4 is better. then 32.Ndxe8 Qxd4+ 33.Qd2 Qxa4+ 33.Qc2 Qa1+ 34.Qc1 Bxf1!} Bxf1 {Capturing the Rook deserves a "?" as Ndxe8 is better. } 32. Ndxe8 Ra5 {Misses ...Qb4 and the subsequent threat of Qe1+} 33. Nxg7 Qb4 34. Bc3 {this and Nf5 are about equally good. } Bg5+ 35. Kb1 Qxa4 {oops. 35...Qc4 is much stronger. threatening the N on c7. The B on c3 cannot as Bd3 wins the Q. } 36. b3 {lemon. Bxa5 picks up the exchange... Without opening up the king position. } Qa3 37. Bxa5 Qxa5 {.strangely enough: ...Bf6!! is Black's best. then 38.Bc3 Bd3! 39.Qxd3 Qxb3+ 40.Kc1 Bg5+ 41.Bd2 (Must Move This) and Black wins the Q and the N on g7. .} 38. Nf5 {38.Nh5 appears to make the position about equal, threatening f4. } Bf6 39. Nxh6+ Kf8 40. Ne6+ Ke8 {...fxe6 is "must move"; Old Timers know it as ECO Box. } 41. Qc6+ Ke7 42. Ng8# {How often does one get to mate with a N going to the 8th rank. very nice finish for White. Nice game for 40 moves for Black. VERY tough struggle. }
