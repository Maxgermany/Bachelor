[Black "AI "]
[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 {A standard opener for me. It helps get my bishop and queen out.} d5 {Not what I expected...} 2. Nc3 {I am now both attacking Black's pawn at d5 and defending mine at e4.} dxe4 {Again, not what I expected. I can now, however, take Black's pawn at e4.} 3. Nxe4 {Now I set the score straight.} f6 {I don't see how this move helps the computer. It actually helps me now.} 4. Qh5+ {Haha... CHECK!} g6 {They now are trying to take my queen and block my attack on the King, I guess.} 5. Qf3 {I thought that a retreat to here would be best, as a retreat to g4 could leave my queen open to a bishop.} Bh6 {I assume this is an attempt at a pin on my bishop at c1 and my pawn at d2.} 6. d3 {This was a win/draw move for me. Either the bishop would not move and I could take it, or he would take my bishop and I could capture it with my rook.} g5 {I guess this was a draw move. I can't capture his bishop now.} 7. Be3 {I'm still going to move my bishop at c1 to get it out on the board and allow queenside castling.} Na6 8. O-O-O {Yay for castling!} c6 9. Qh5+ {Yay for check! (again!) Notice how this would also be a fork with the bishop at h6 if not for the knight at g8.} Kd7 {Now they can't castle! Go me!} 10. Qg4+ {Now I'm going to try to set up for checkmate.} e6 {Well, they did the thing I didn't want them to do. Now their king has better mobility. Oh well.} 11. d4 f5 {Uh-oh... fork.} 12. Qh5 {I'll save my queen.} fxe4 {Great. I'm 3 points behind.} 13. h4 b5 14. hxg5 {CAPTURE! Now I'm only 2 points behind.} Bf8 {Perfect. Just what I wanted.} 15. Qf7+ {This might have been a fork if not for Black's queen.} Ne7 {Hmmf. I hate blocks.} 16. Bf4 {Setting up for checkmate...} h6 17. d5 exd5 {Perfect...} 18. g3 h5 19. Bh3# {Checkmate! :) It took me 19 moves to checkmate.}
