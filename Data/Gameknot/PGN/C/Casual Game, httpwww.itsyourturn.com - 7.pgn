1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Queen's gambit opening.} dxc4 {Queen's gambit accepted.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Ne4 {Moving the knight twice in the opening is weak.  Seems like a novice  mistake. } 5. Bxc4 Qd6 {It doesn't make sense to bring the queen out so early.  Now White wants to attack many juicy targets, but before he does that, it makes the most sense to .... } 6. O-O Bg4 {In my chess lessons, I have repeatedly shown examples of how this move can run into problems after white plays moves like Ne5 and Qb3.  The problem is that in queen pawn openings, moving the c8 biship leaves the b7 square vulnerable where white can at least gain a tempo by playing Qb3. } 7. Qb3 {I don't see black recovering from this. } Qg6 {7... Qb6 8. Bxf7+ Looks good for white.  Now maybe ... Kd8 9. Ne5 } 8. Ne5 {I seem to be attacking everything. } Qg5 {Now white could play Nxg4, Bxf7+, or ... } 9. Qxb7 {Attacking the rook and the knight at the same time, thinking 9. ... Bf3 10. Qc8#, or after 9. ... Bh3, then both 10. Qxe4 and 10. Bb5+ look strong. } Bh3 {Black wants to checkmate me.} 10. Bb5+ {Now if 10. ... Kd8 11. Nxf7#.  I was hoping for 10. ... Bd7 11. Qc8#. } Nd7 11. Qxa8# {}
