[Opening "QGA, 4.Nc3 (D24)"]

1. d4 {The classical Queen's pawn opening, simple and trustworthy} d5 {symmetrical play, black will have to deviate sooner or later} 2. c4 {The Queen's Gambit, giving you the option of taking the pawn, but allowing me better control of the center.} dxc4 {queen's gambit accepted.  I now have easy development, and am able to control the center with greater ease.  For black, you must be prepared to counter-attack heavily against the center I seek to build with moves like c5, and if d5, then e6.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 {continuing simple development, and central control} Nc6 {not recommended.  I am trying to build a nice center with pawns on d4 and e4, a key counter is c5, which your knight now blocks.  If 4...c5  5.d5 e6  6.e4 exd5  7.exd5  and although I have a passed pawn, it's isolated and could become weak later on.} 5. e4 {now I have an awesome mobile center} e6 6. Bxc4 {regaining the pawn with better development, and central control} Bd6 {??  walks into the fork  6...Be7 or 6...Bb4 was better} 7. e5 {winning a piece} Bb4 8. exf6 gxf6 {weakens your pawn structure, but opens the g-file for your rook} 9. O-O e5 10. d5 {by not taking the pawn on e5, I keep your pawn structure bad, and increase pressure in your position with the push.} Na5 {? 12...Bxc3 was the only move, all else fails due to the queen fork} 11. Qa4+ {stealing another piece} c6 12. Qxb4 Nxc4 13. Qxc4 b5 {ouch, open invitation for me to get my thorn of a queen in further, if nothing else, 13...Rg8 with the idea of 14...Bh3 would be an attempt to fight back} 14. Qxc6+ Bd7 {best, letting the queen protect the rook} 15. Qd6 {keeping the king locked in for the time being, and preparing to bring in my other pieces to the attack.  15...Qe7 stops the main attack, but after the trade of queens, it's a winning endgame for white} Rc8 16. Ne4 {doom looms on the horizon, best is 16...Qe7} Rg8 {loses the queen...} 17. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {no other choice} 18. Qxf6 e4 19. Re1 {bringing more reinforcements.  My queen is doing a good job holding your king in place, and Qe5  would just let your king run off farther} b4 {19...Rg6 was likely better} 20. Ne5 {practically forced mate if 20...Rf8  21.d6 and it's impossible to prevent 22.Qe7 mate} h5 {mate in two...} 21. Qxf7+ Kd8 22. Qxd7# {lessons of tricks and traps: look at the possible consequences of your moves, and if your opponent can check you, always check what that will do (e.g. the idea of Qa4  and winning your bishop).  Development, central control, king safety, and don't give up anything for free if you can help it.}
