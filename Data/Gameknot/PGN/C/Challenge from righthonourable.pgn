[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), two pawns' attack, Mikenas variation"]

1. e4 {My first annotated game, for the benefit of a learning friend...} Nf6 {Alekhine's defence (B02). Not all that uncommon, but interesting for a beginner.} 2. e5 {Mokele Mbembe (Buecker) variation.} Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 {Steiner variation.} 4. c5 {Two pawns' (Lasker's) attack.} Nd5 {Two pawns' attack, Mikenas variation.} 5. Bc4 e6 6. Nc3 Bxc5 {Deviation from the book. (6. ... d6). This allows white the opportunity to control the centre, as well as an annoying advanced centre pawn. The single pawn advantage of black is superficial and short-lived.} 7. Nxd5 exd5 8. Bxd5 {Regained pawn.} c6 {Fair enough: opens up the diagonal for the black queen as well as forcing the bishop back.} 9. Be4 Qa5 {A bit premature.} 10. Ne2 d5 {Would have been strong if not for en passant!} 11. exd6 e.p. {At least there's no advanced white pawn any more, right?} O-O {Should have castled earlier instead of 9. ... Qa5, but at least no time is wasted now capturing the d6 pawn (It's black's anyway) plus there's a juicy central e-file begging for a rook.} 12. O-O Nd7 13. a3 {Beware b4 (not now, as there's 14. b4 Bxb4 15. axb4 Qxa1) but it's a possible future threat.} Nf6 14. d3 {Looking to un-double pawns and close off the open file while opening up the diagonal for the c1 bishop.} Bb6 {Bb6? Better is the long delayed Bxd6.} 15. Bf4 {Oh dear. The advanced pawn lives.} Nxe4 {Another blunder (see comment for 14. d3).} 16. dxe4 {d6 is now protected by both queen and bishop; there's a d7 threat, and white has both his centre pawns while black has none. Black's bishop pair is weak because... well, they aren't paired.} f5 {Weakening the king-side without being in the position to attack. Also ignored d7.} 17. d7 fxe4 18. dxc8=N Raxc8 {White lost both centre pawns for that undeveloped bishop, and also gifted black a centre spot. There's also pressure on f2 from both rook and bishop.  But e4 is isolated and the king-side is weak.} 19. Qd7 Rcd8 {19. ... Qa6 would not loose the b7 pawn, and would also attack e2, gaining tempo.} 20. Qxb7 Rd2 {Outright loss for black. The game was recoverable until now.} 21. Bxd2 Qxd2 22. Nc3 {The added pressure on f2 won't help now.} Bxf2+ 23. Kh1 {Nice try, but white doesn't have to comply with the trade. Black humbly took the f2 bait. Without even having to move a piece, white's rook can now contest the f-file.} Bd4 {Bd4!? And the f-file immediately wins it.} 24. Qb3+ {White enters the conditional moves 24. ... Rf7 25. Qb8 Rf1 26 Rxf1# and 24. ... Kh8 15. Rxf8#. Black resigns.}
