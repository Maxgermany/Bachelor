[Opening "King's Indian (E87), Saemisch, orthodox, Bronstein variation"]

1. d4 {Charles starts off with his usual.} Nf6 {Not surprisingly, since Janet has also played this move, ION is either going for, Benoni Defense the Colle's System, or KID.  Time will tell.} 2. c4 {It looks like this has become the Benoni Defense because 2.e3 is played in the Colle's System.  And, unlike with other openings, it can't transpose here since the Colle's Franketort does not have white playing c4. } g6 {As it turns out, ION decided to play the KID.  This is very interesting as I do have a little experience with it, after playing against it in my first training game with Ken.  And, what makes it even more interesting is that it is headed into unfamiliar territory, as we will see later on.  That makes it even more educational because it shows just how intense openings can be, as the trainer emphasized.  Likewise, it also shows that ION is very familiar with this opening.} 3. Nc3 {Meanwhile, Charles continues with his development.} Bg7 {As anticipated.} 4. e4 {I was a little surprised by this move as he is breaking through before castling.  But, it is interesting.  That for me is something new because I would've done something different, like 4.g3 to fianchetto.  That doesn't make it bad, but rather something for me to learn since it shows that there can be several variations in the KID as this position illustrates.} d6 {Meanwhile, this makes move sense as ION opens a line for his B.  Obviously, no good would be 4...b7 since in general, but especially in the KID, a double fianchetto is not wise, as Ken explained.} 5. f3 {I was a little surprised to see this played.  In this position, I very much like 5.Nf3 as it develops and gets Charles ready to castle.  However, I like this to since white has a nice pawn chain.  } O-O {Of course, as Jack Stockel puts it, ION plays it safe by castling.} 6. Be3 {That's where Charles uses the opportunity to continue with his development.} e5 {ION wants to exchange here.} 7. d5 {But, like with my first game against Ken, Charles refuses.} Nh5 {This is an interesting square.  As, ION preparing to give way to a check.  I wonder why the idea is to check since it appears that Charles can get out of it easily.  But, there's gotta to be something else.} 8. Qd2 {Mobilizing his Queen and preparing to castle long.  What makes it interesting is both players castling on opposite wings which we don't see too often.} Qh4+ 9. g3 {I anticipated 9.Bf2.  But, I like this move just as much.} Nxg3 {This is a move that I would not have considered.  At first glance, it appears that ION gave away a piece.  But, he hasn't because of white's Rh1.  Instead, it gets interesting.} 10. Qf2 {As it appears that Charles is well protected. } Nxf1 {But, ION gives away his Queen for two pieces and a pawn.  Similar to what happened with Ken, being able to do this means that ION is very familiar with this variation.} 11. Qxh4 Nxe3 12. Qf2 {Knowing that his c4 pawn cannot be protected, Charles hits the N.  But, this gives ION back a pawn.} Nxc4 13. b3 {I guess you can say, doing what he can, Charles hits the N.  Once ION protects, white castles, at once.} Nb6 14. O-O-O Na6 {I don't know why ION.} 15. Nge2 {But, nothing stops Charles from completing his development.} Nc5 {Like before, I don't know why ION played this. } 16. b4 {Not knowing what else to do, I also would've played this to gain tempo.  But, ION has an exchange in mind, with which Charles accepts.  As white, I would not have accepted the exchange, but as we know, stronger players see things that we do not see.} Nca4 17. Nxa4 Nxa4 18. h4 {Not surprisingly, Charles is going for an open flank.} h5 {And, ION puts a stop to that.} 19. Kb1 {Charles has a plan to reposition his Rd1-c1, where ION's c7 pawn will become a target.} a5 {ION wants to exchange here as that would give his Ra8 more mobility.} 20. Rdc1 {But, Charles refuses for now by targeting.  But, ION is going to exchange because it appears that white's b4 pawn is more mobile then black's c7 pawn. } axb4 21. Rxc7 b6 {Not to my surprise, ION advances his pawn here.  I think that the idea is lessoning or taking the weakness of the doubled pawns.  However, I'm not sure, but that is a speculation.} 22. Rh2 {It appears that Charles played this to bring his other Rook to a more mobile square.} Ba6 {Redeploying his Bishop to a more active square and completing his development.  } 23. Qe1 {And, Charles answer is by targeting ION's b4 pawn.} Nc5 {Of course, ION is going to let it go since that was a bad pawn, and thus, had no use.  Instead, the N isn't just worth more, but it is more powerful and mobile, in this position.} 24. Qxb4 Bd3+ {As ION reserved this move.  In other words, it was a waiting move by him.} 25. Ka1 Ra4 {As now, ION isn't just attacking the Queen, but he's also placing an attacking force against Charles monarch.  So, King safety might become an issue here which is why he was willing to give up another pawn.} 26. Qxb6 Rc4 {The pressure keeps piling up.} 27. Rc6 {Not surprisingly, Charles attacks another pawn.} Bh6 {Once again, ION is willing to give it away.} 28. Rg2 {But, Charles refuses.  Which means that to take would be a mistake here.  As now, Charles goes on a different attack.  Maybe, the idea is to put pressure against the King since ION is putting pressure, as well.} Kh7 {Defending means exchanging like crazy.  This shows that despite being behind, ION is more then happy to liquidate.  My inference is that he's got a winning advantage.  If so, that would not surprise me because it appears that his pressure is overwhelming. } 29. Rxd6 Bxe2 30. Rxe2 Rc1+ {This shows it.  Surely, Charles will get out of check, but ION has some nasty surprises here.  For example, he will win back the Queen for a piece, after these checks.  That's the beauty to some of this.} 31. Kb2 Na4+ 32. Kb3 Nxb6 33. Rxb6 Rf1 {Meanwhile, Charles goes for another pawn.} 34. Kb4 {Because this is an endgame, Charles is willing to give it up since the K is a powerful weapon.} Rxf3 35. Kb5 {Continuing the K+P+R endgame by moving his King up.} Rh3 {And, ION is aiming to get another pawn.} 36. a4 {As the saying goes, "Passed pawns must be pushed".  That is even at the expense of another pawn, since Charles goal is to promote.} Rxh4 37. a5 Rh1 38. a6 Rb1+ {But, ION is putting a stop to that.  And, it starts with a couple of checks.} 39. Kc6 Rc8+ 40. Kb7 Rb8+ {And, it continues by exchanging Rooks.} 41. Kxb8 Rxb6+ 42. Ka7 {Doing what he can to keep the a6 pawn well with the idea of promoting.  So, Charles attacks the Rook, in the process.} Rb3 43. d6 {If Charles can't promote his a pawn, then he goes for plan B which is to promote to the d pawn.} Rd3 {But, ION puts a stop to that.} 44. Kb8 {With that being said, Charles goes back to plan A, as he hands ION the d pawn.} Rxd6 45. a7 {As now, Charles will promote.  But, can be stopped?  We will find out soon.} Ra6 {The answer is yes.  For once, Charles promotes, ION will take, and thus, will win the exchange.} 46. a8=Q Rxa8+ 47. Kxa8 Bf4 {Protecting his e5 pawn, in case, Charles plays Rd5.} 48. Kb7 {Instead, Charles uses his K.  The idea is to do what he can to win that pawn, and support the with the K to promote.  As the idea is getting unstoppable promotion.} h4 {But, ION goes for it by pushing his passed pawn.} 49. Kb6 {Still trying to get his K to the e5 pawn. } g5 {But, ION pushed another passed pawn.  And, with it he has a pawn chain.  With that, Charles resigned here.  That's because black will use those two pawns down the fourth the and fifth rank all the way to the promotion square.  It will be one on top of the other, so that if ION promotes, and Charles takes one of them, black will promote and win the Rook in the process.  With that being said, the position is hopeless for white.}
