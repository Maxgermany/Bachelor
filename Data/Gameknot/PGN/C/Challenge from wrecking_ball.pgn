[Opening "Blumenfeld counter-gambit (E10)"]

1. d4 {Joe, starts conventionally.} Nf6 {Not only does this move develop, but it prevents white from playing the QG which is safe to infer that Terence has less experience then other openings with 1.d4 since Susan Polgar implied what elyhim once said which I've used, "Stick with what you know".} 2. c4 {Trying to transpose this into a KID.} e6 {And, Terence abides.} 3. Nf3 {As now, we're going into the mainlines as 3...c5 is often played.  And, that is how Terence, not surprisingly, is going to answer.} c5 4. d5 {As white, I would've taken on c5.  But, I understand why Joe didn't play this because that would leave him with doubled pawns.  So, he advances and tries to exchange on e6 which is what will happen.} exd5 5. cxd5 d6 {Stopping Joe's d5 from advancing further.  That pawn is dangerous, and in some variations, white is threatening to win a piece.  By playing this, it's blocked, therefore, preventing damage.} 6. Nc3 {Therefore, Joe develops.} g6 {And, this is why I said that we've tranposed into the KID since this is played.  It's earlier, so it happened but in a different order.  That becomes obvious when 7...Bg7 is played, after Joe brings his Nf3-d2.} 7. Nd2 Bg7 8. e4 {Bearing in mind that it's protected, Joe plays this, as now, white has a nice pawn chain.} O-O {After which, Terence castles.} 9. Be2 {Continuing with his development and preparing to castle, as well.} Nbd7 {Which enables Terence to complete his development.} 10. O-O {So, Joe brings his K to safety, at once.} Re8 {Centralizing his Rook, and Terence pointed out that it's very useful in controlling the center.} 11. a4 {Getting a semi open file, which Joe mentioned is very useful in his Q sac threads.  And, TA mentioned that it was something that he does to defeat some of those opponents.  As white, though, I would've played 11.Nc4 where the N appears better placed.  But, I like this move a lot, however.} Ne5 {With that being said, however, Terence brings his N to a better outpost.} 12. Re1 {And, Joe now centralizes his Rook.} Nfg4 {I like this placement of his N even better, as it appears that Joe is now dealing with a little pressure on the K side.} 13. Nf1 {Therefore, he plays this to alleviate a little of that pressure.} Nh6 {I am not sure why Terense retreated back.  Maybe it was to prevent the exchange since there's nothing to be gained without the pressure on white's K side.} 14. Bb5 {Which enables Joe to attack the Rook, and obviously, Terense defends and doesn't want to exchange.  I would've since white's Bb5 appears more active, but I guess that black's pieces have better mobility, in this position.  I say that based on my first lesson with kenneth_fiore_3.} Rf8 15. Bf4 {I don't know why Joe this played because he's not going for an exchange.  Maybe, he wants to harrass, but Terence defends with his next move since the Bishop is attacked.  After that, Joe redefends because instead of running back, white reattacks with 16.Qd2.} f5 16. Qd2 Nef7 {That's where it becomes obvious, though, that the point of 15.Bf4 was to exchange his Ne5 for white's Bf4.  However, the N is, as usual more active and better placed which is why, like my game with Ken, Terence also declines.} 17. h3 {Opening up the K side to give his Bf4 more mobility and, thus, protect it.  That makes sense, as Terense is threatening to win a piece for free.  Without this move, the threat was 17...g5  Now, if white should then take with 18.Bxg5, obviously 18...Nxg5, and Joe cannot recapture with the Queen because of black's Queen.  So, if he played 18.Bg3 or 18.Be3, his B would be trapped after 18...f4.  I remember all of this from that club game between brigadecommander and stalhandske at WTWLTR club.} g5 {That threat is even more obvious because of this move which enables Joe to safely retreat back.} 18. Bh2 f4 {Which enables black to advance.  I favor black's position ever so slightly, though, because Terence is threatening is threatening to mess up the pawn structures around Joe's K with f3 which would leave it exposed.  Of course, Joe prevents that, but I believe that things are becoming a little difficult for white now, especially because Joe's Nf1 is locked in.} 19. Be2 Ne5 {With that being said, Terence bring his inactive N to a better square which leaves more mobile now.} 20. f3 {And, Joe stops black's pawn from advancing further.} Nhf7 {Strengthening his other N where, as noted, one of Joe's N's is locked in.} 21. a5 {I guess that Joe is trying to get a passed pawn or an open file to get the advantage.} Bd7 {But, it does not bother Terence since black completes his development.} 22. Reb1 {Preventing his b2 from becoming a target.  What's interesting to me is that it's unusual for both sides to have this much material this late in the game.  Usual, more things are exchanged, and sometimes, we're already talking about an endgame but not here. } h5 {Trying to get a passed pawn of his own.} 23. Kh1 {So, Joe stops that by bringing his King in the corner, where it's said to be safer, as I learned from Jack Stockel.} Ng6 {Trying to exchange N for B.} 24. a6 {Which Joe does not accept because if Terence takes now, Joe is guaranteed an unstoppable passed pawn.} b6 {So, Terence, for the obvious reason prevents that.} 25. Ra3 {Not exactly sure why Joe played this.  I think his plan was to double up both Rooks on the a file.} Nfe5 {So, Terence, once again, repositions his N.} 26. Qd1 {Trying to reposition Nf1-d2 which would be a better outpost.} g4 {But, after this move, Joe resigns.  I think that resignation was premature since there appears to be plenty of fight left.  However, Joe pointed out why you generally shouldn't resign, especially with the Q sac.  So, after that, I figured out why white threw in the towel.  That's because in all variations, white's position cannot be saved.  Either he is going down a piece, or elyhim will get a passed pawn one way or another that can't be stopped which would enable a promotion.}
