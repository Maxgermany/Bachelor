1. e4 {Hi all! This is a game I recently played in a mini tournament. I have kept my opponents name anonymous.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {The Four Knights Opening. My favorite, because all of my pieces are protected and safe. } 4. Bb5 b6 {Not the usual response... I would have expected ...a6 or ...Bb4.} 5. O-O Bb7 6. d3 {Gotta get my bishop in the battle before I start my attack.} g6 {Preparing ...Bg7, but if he does that, I'll execute my master plan...} 7. Bg5 {Phase one of my plan.} Bg7 {Excellent. Now for phase two.} 8. Qd2 {Phase Two: Align the queen with the bishop to prepare for Bh6.} O-O {Even better. Now, if my plan works, I will have a perfect mating net.} 9. Bh6 {Phase Three: Purposing a bishop trade. 9. ...Bxh6 10. Qxh6 and the king is trapped in my web! Right now, black should just ignore my last move and maybe get his queen active.} a6 {Black threatens my bishop. He ignores my h bishop... for now... } 10. Bxc6 {Not the best, but at least I get something.} Bxh6 {Now black takes the bait!} 11. Qxh6 {My queen is in perfect position.} Bxc6 12. Ng5 {Now, if black's knight moves anywhere, it's checkmate Qxh7. My next couple moves would probably be 13. f4, exf4 (hopefully) 14.Rxf4, threatening the knight and checkmate} Ng4 {Ouch. Look at your opponents last move before you make yours.} 13. Qxh7# {And that's the game, folks. Hasta La Vista.}
