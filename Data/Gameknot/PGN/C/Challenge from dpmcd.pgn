1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {Strange opening coming up here} Nf6 3. Nxe5 {I take the unprotected pawn} Nxe4 {And he does the same} 4. Qe2 {I was hoping for Nf6, Nc6+, getting the queen, but he knows how to protect it} d5 5. c4 {Removing the gaurd} Be6 {What do you know, extra protection} 6. cxd5 Qxd5 7. Qb5+ {Trading queens} c6 8. Qxd5 Bxd5 9. Bc4 {Forcing a trade} Bxc4 10. Nxc4 Bc5 {To put presure on me- not happening} 11. Ne3 O-O 12. O-O {I castle, to stay secure} Rd8 13. Re1 Bd4 14. h3 Nc5 15. Na3 {Questioning his weird moves} Nd3 {The following would come if I hadn't played it right-Rd1, NxC1, RxC1, BxB2, forking the rooks } 16.

Rxe3 g6 {Blocking a possoble back rank mate, like I did} 25. Kh2 {Waisting no time to that move } Nd4 {He was tring to get a pawn on the run, eh?} 26. Rd3 a6 27. Nc7 c4 28.

Rg3 {Wanting to trade again. } Ng2+ {As of the move before, I blocked my kings only moving spot. I could not make it a rook and a pawn vs. a knight. I decided to resighn.
