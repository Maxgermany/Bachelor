1. e4 {This in annotation of a game played against a team mate for coaching only.  I have never coached, never been coached and never annotated a game.  So any comments are welcome!} e5 {e4 e5, very popular opening among "beginners". This often leads to an open game.   In open games it's important to have the bishop pair (so if you have the possiblity to exchange a knight for a bishop, you should consider it) because the bishop can control a complete diagonal when the center is open.} 2. Nf3 {During the opening, develop all pieces (N, B, R) before attacking. Also develop your pieces towards the center, like Nf3 is much better Nh3 for instance.} Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 {The Scotch game. White has 2 options: defending the knight with Be3 (not c3, because 5. ... Qh4 will give you problems) or running away. If you chose to run make sure don't lose a tempo or you'll delay your devellopment. Nb3 is good because black is forced to move his bishop again = no tempo lost. Nf3 is less good.} 5. Nb3 Bb6 {good choice, keeping controle of d4 and f2.} 6. Nc3 {devellopment and protecting e4. Controling d5.} d6 {Opening for the white squared bishop} 7. Bc4 {Extra control of d5 and ready to castle} Nf6 8. O-O O-O 9. Bg5 {pinning the knight and threating Nd5.} h6 {Good move, asking to exchange pieces or when not getting rid of that annoying pin} 10. Bh4 {No way, I'll exchange my bishop for that knight and getting his dark squared bishop and queen pointing at f2.} a5 {a5? Ofcourse I expected g5, but I realised that he still had a change to play g5 after Nd5.} 11. Nd5 Bg4 {Beginners mistake.  Not seeing the check by capturing the defender of the attacker, and winning a piece with tempo} 12. Nxf6+ {check} Kh8 13. Qxg4 {A piece behind and opening kings position totally.  Game is in fact already lost for black, but he decided to play further.  No problem for me.} gxf6 14. Qf5 Rg8 15. Bxf6+ {Losing his queen for a bishop} Qxf6 16. Qxf6+ Rg7 {Rook is pinned} 17. c3 {c3 to create a spot (d4) where my knight can go} Ne5 {Attacking the bishop} 18. Be2 {Preventing Nf3 without losing the pin } Ng4 {Not seeing that his rook is still pinned! } 19. Bxg4 Re8 20. Rfe1 c5 21. Qxd6 {Crabbing a pawn} Bd8 22. Bf5 c4 23. Qxh6+ {Collecting anoter pawn now with check} Kg8 {forced move} 24. Nc5 Bg5 25. Qh5 {Seeing a mate pattern, whites queen on the place of blacks e8 rook will be victorious} Re5 26. Ne6 {Knight sacrifice...} fxe6 {Better was Rxe6, changing a rook for a knight and bishop.} 27. Qe8# {Checkmate}
