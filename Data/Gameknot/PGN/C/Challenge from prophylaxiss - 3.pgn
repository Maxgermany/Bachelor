1. e4 {Ruy Lopez, Berlin Defense, C65  } Nc6 {After seeing 1...Nc6, I decided to steer the game into a Ruy Lopez.  } 2. Nf3 e5 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O Bd6 {Lasker would never play 4...Bd6, as he would say it does the "work" of immobilizing the d7 pawn, the c8 bishop, and the a8 rook.  Black's lack of mobility in this game, due primarily to this "stuck" move, cost him the game in the end.} 5. d4 Qe7 6. d5 {Rather than keeping tension in the center, I decided to gain a central space advantage, since it is one of the infamous 3 S's in the Chinese school of chess opening principles--space, structure, and strategy--as per Liu Wenzhe's marvelous book entitled, "The Chinese School of Chess: The unique approach, training methods, and secrets."} a6 7. Bd3 Nb4 8. Bc4 a5 9. a3 Na6 10. Nc3 Nc5 11. Re1 O-O 12. Bg5 h6 13. Bd2 Kh8 14. g3 a4 15. b4 {Having control of the center due to the overprotection of d5 and e4, I decided to commence operations on the queenside...} axb3 e.p. 16. cxb3 b6 17. b4 Nb7 18. Na4 Qd8 19. Bc3 Re8 20. Bb5 Nh7 21. Nb2 Ng5 22. Nc4 Nxf3+ {Black moved this knight 4 times before exchanging it for this White knight which only moved 1 time...} 23. Qxf3 f6 {Protecting the f-pawn, but it immobilizes the queen and weakens the kingside pawn structure with holes now at g6, f5, and h5.  Black is therefore weak on the light squares on his kingside, and White need not fear a kingside attack, so he continues queenside operations...} 24. a4 Bf8 25. Reb1 Nd6 {Notice too how many times this knight has moved in the game, and now it is gone, replaced by the bishop which repeats its lazy leitmotif of immobilization and obstruction...} 26. Nxd6 Bxd6 27. Qd3 Qe7 28. a5 Kg8 29. a6 Ra7 {Now that Black's queenside rook and bishop are tied to the defense of White's a-pawn, White knows he can eventually stage a breakthrough on the kingside, primarily due to a much greater advantage in mobility and a larger number of forces which can take part in the battle of that sector...} 30. Bc4 h5 31. Rbe1 g6 {Now h6 and g6 are weakened...} 32. Reb1 Rf8 33. h4 {Fixing the h5 pawn, and preparing eventually to continue on the kingside via f3 and g4.  The pawns on f2, g3, and h4 remind me of a common motif in the King's Indian Attack...} Re8 34. Bd2 {Over the next several moves, I thought of applying Silman's endgame principle of "torturing the opponent" to further induce mistakes in the enemy's position...} Kg7 35. Qf3 Qf8 36. Qe3 Kh7 37. Ra2 Rd8 38. Qe2 Qg7 39. Ra3 Qf7 40. Rc3 Re8 41. Rf3 Qe7 42. Kg2 Kg7 43. Ra3 Kh7 44. f3 Kg7 45. Raa1 Rd8 46. Qd3 Re8 47. Qb3 Kg8 48. Qc3 Kg7 49. g4 {Here, I felt it time to begin breaking open the kingside, since the queenside and center are still under White's control, thereby preventing a successful counterattack...} hxg4 50. fxg4 Rh8 51. Rbh1 c6 52. h5 {This move leads to a passed pawn on the kingside rook file in addition to the one already on the queenside rook file.  Also, Black loses a valuable kingside defender (his one active rook) and now has to find some way to defend the kingside front as well as the queenside--with highly immobile, fixed, and obstructed forces.  It turns out to be too many holes to have to plug in the sinking ship.} gxh5 53. Rxh5 Rxh5 54. gxh5 b5 {This move (along with 51.c6) mortally weakens Black's queenside, and White's next move decides the game...} 55. Qe3 bxc4 56. Qxa7 Kf7 57. Qb6 f5 58. a7 {If 58...Qh4 then 59.Qf2 Qxe4+ 60.Qf3 prevents further efficacious counterplay and safeguards the eventual win.  Black's general has had enough and surrenders.}
