Qc4 b6 18. Nc7+ Kd8 19. Nxa8 Bb7 20. Rd1 Bxa8 21. b4 Nb7 22. Qd4 Rf7 23. Rf1 Re7 24. Rf8+ {This is the move I planned mate on, earlier i was planning Qd7, bur was going to take a while to remove the rook from either e or f7... and then after Kc7, the thought did cross my mind of mating quicker, with Qd6, but again, the Knight was nicely placed, so this worked out as I had analysed it, and Im pleased about it, and wanted to show you all} Kc7 {Could've played Re8, maybe should have, didnt look at that line...had a feeling (as most low players sometimes play) when down on pieces, not to give up the pieces they have left, i do it almost as second nature, when im down in material, something which can be good, but also bad as we see here..} 25. Nb5+ {King only has one spot to move, cant block the Knight check} Kc6 26. Qc4+ {King is now trapped, but his Knight can come to his rescue here briefly..} Nc5 {And does} 27. Rc8+ {If the pawn outpost wasnt there on e5, the Knight still would have covered it, but I'm starting to learn, and see many a mate where, the pawn/s play a vital role, as outposts, for later on in the game. Something I didn't use much in my over-the-board play that I'm now trying to implement into my game} Kb7 {Once again his only move, and time to put the King out of his misery..} 28. Nd6# {And there we have it, Mate in 4 as planned. When Black played 23...Re7, that was what gave me the idea he wanted to protect that Rook, he was not willing to make the exchange. Would it have saved him the game, making the exchange? A Queen and 10 points in material down, its very unlikely, but it would have given White a bit more to do, as 24...Re8 would have over Kc7.  Please comment, and hope you enjoy!}
