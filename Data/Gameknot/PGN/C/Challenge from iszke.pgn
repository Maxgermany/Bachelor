1. f4 {I'm using this more to help myself think out my moves than as an educational tool.  Feel free to read if you like...you may gain some insight in how another player plays  This is a new one.  } Nf6 2. e3 d5 3. Nf3 {I have to think he will move the King Queens side, so I will open the board that direction.} e6 4. b3 {I assume he is opening the diagonal for his bishop.  I'll move my bishop to protect the knight and open up a king side castle.} Be7 5. Bb2 c5 {Opening Queen side} 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. Bxd7+ Qxd7 8. O-O {Did not think he'd castle King side.  I need to bring knight up to prevent his knight from getting to e5, but don't trade if he goes there, it opens f} Nc6 9. Nc3 a6 {Protecting against the rook and advancing pawns} 10. Ne2 h6 11. Ne5 Nxe5 12. fxe5 {I would like to move the knight to g5.  I don't think he'll chase with the h pawn and open his King more.} Ne4 13. d3 Ng5 14. Ng3 {I want to leave his pawn on e5 cutting off his bishop.  he colud sacrifice his knight to advance the pawn so I should guard against that...} g6 15. Qe1 Rf8 16. a4 {pushing the h pawn to attack the knight and then clear the King.} h5 17. h4 {I can back up my knight and attack his pawn which will pin his knight to the Queen.} Nh7 18. Ne2 {Well he blocked my pawn attack and immobilized my knight.  I back up the bishop with my Queen to attack the pawn, but g3 defeats that.  It could be a distraction though, that allows me to open the a rank.  I think I may want to plug up that side fo the board, though.} a5 19. d4 b6 {I am setting up a defender for a bishop if he takes.  dxc5, Bxc5 putting an attacker on the King} 20. Bc1 {e5 just lost some importance, but is just one move away from regaining it.    I am thinking about g5 to work his King side more.  It would also allow my knight out who could go to e4, a very strong position.  I can still castle Queen side...  } g5 21. Qc3 {I can only guess what he's doing with this.    If he takes c5 my bishop is still available and would clear out for the queen to get to his King side for an attack.} gxh4 22. e4 {Good move.  It opened up his Queen to help King side, made a lane for the bishop, and if he follows it with exd5, my knight will not have any protection at e4.  I am going to try to gain some tempo with cxd4.  He must either use the knight to take the pawn, or move the queen, otherwise I can pin the queen to the King with the bishop.  } cxd4 23. Nxd4 Bc5 {I'm pinning his knight for now, I may get to attack the rook with the bishop.  I would like to get the rook over to c and maybe have a idsovered attack on the queen.  Long shot....} 24. Be3 {His bishop unpins the knight.  what can the knight do????  I don't mind if he takes the d pawn because I'll retake with the queen and have an attack on g2.  I'll move the rook to g to set up for that.} Rg8 {This move also goes back to the earlier strategy that 22. e4 blocked.} 25. Nb5 {His knight getting to d6 is dangerous if it has any support, so I'll trade bishops to draw off the Queen.} Bxe3+ 26. Qxe3 Ke7 27. Rad1 {The rook is attacking my Queen, but she can't move far because of the knight pressure.  Qc6 lets me attack g2 if the pawns trade.if the queen ends up on d5, the knight will have a queen rook pin} Qc6 28. Qh6 {Qxc2 threatens mate} Qxc2 29. Rd2 {His queen is protecting the rook, so if I go Qxe4 I difuse a threat, protect the knight, and keep pressure on g2} Qxe4 30. Qxh5 Raf8 31. Nd6 Qg6 {I am going to let my h pawn go to build a better defense where I can get rid of white's e pawn} 32. Qe2 {I thought he'd take the h pawn, but he moved off.  It looks like he took the Queen out of play...  I'm going to try to dispose of the white e pawn now.} f6 33. Qa6 Rfd8 {King needs a protector and the pressure is off of the f pawn} 34. Qxb6 fxe5 {He's taking some pawns back and will have a good avenue for the a and b pawns.  I'll have to try to win quickly..} 35. Rf7+ {Ahhh! crushing mistake.  I have to give up the Queen to the knight.  I have an up hill climb from here...} Qxf7 36. Nxf7 Kxf7 37. Rf2+ Ke7 {Reacting....I need to try to bring the knight forward whil the rooks protect the King.} 38. Qc7+ Rd7 39. Qxe5 Ng5 40. Kh2 Ne4 41. Rf3 Rg5 42. Qf4 e5 43. Qxh4 Kd6 44. Qh6+ Kc5 45. Qa6 Rh7+ 46. Kg1 Nd2 47. Qc8+ Kd4 48. Qc3+ Ke4 49. Qe3# {}
