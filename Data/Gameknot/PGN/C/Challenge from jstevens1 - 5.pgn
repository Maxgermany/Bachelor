[Opening "Old Indian defence (A41)"]

1. d4 d6 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e5 {The old indian defense, offering a queen exchange.} 4. dxe5 {was not sure my opponent would exchange given the results in the gameknot database, but they did!} dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 6. Bg5 {here white looks like they are gaining an advantage, but black has surprising resources} c6 7. O-O-O+ Kc7 8. Bxf6 {This exhange is probably appealing because the pawns are doubled but loses the bishop pair in a fairly open position, while white does not have any immediate way of exploiting the doubled pawns. Black has nothing to fear and has good endgame prospects. } gxf6 9. Nf3 Be6 10. e4 Bc5 11. Rd2 Nd7 12. Bd3 Nb6 13. b3 Rad8 14. Rf1 {Black has systematically attacked subtle weaknesses in white's position and has gained a slight initiative.} Rd7 15. Nd1 Rhd8 16. Be2 Rd7xd2 17. Nxd2 f5 {black's plan was to force the exchanges and then undouble the pawn , opening up the bishop pair with a slight initiative.} 18. exf5 Bxf5 19. Nb1 {White is on the defensive, so black pushes the initiative, probing for weaknesses.} a5 20. Ne3 Be4 21. g3 Bg6 22. Rd1 Rxd1+ 23. Bxd1 f5 {Black continues to push a slight initiative.} 24. Bc2 e4 25. Nc3 Kd6 26. Ne2 Ke5 27. Kd1 {Black continues to look for a way in, while white continues to block black's advances.} Bh5 28. Ke1 Nd7 29. Nd1 Kf6 30. h4 Ne5 31. Ng1 Bb4+ 32. Kf1 b5 {Black has mounted various threats to try and find inroads, which white has parried. While white remains on the defensive, Black needs to find a way to exploit greater mobility. Black decides to take a risk and open up the position, even though it gives white some counterplay.  } 33. cxb5 cxb5 34. a4 {white's plan is to exchange both pawns, and then exploit the open diagonal.  black is hoping that keeping the a4 pawn on the white squares creates a slightly bad bishop and will open up opportunities for attack.} bxa4 35. bxa4 Nc4 36. Ne3 Nxe3+ 37. fxe3 {At this point, Black is trying to exploit the bishop pair and a space advantage to tie White up by retaining threats on both sides of the board. But if White can get the Knight to a good square and/or exploit Black's blockaded white square pawn formation with his bishop, Black's chances are problematic. Black decides to probe and see what White does.} Bd2 38. Kf2 {Black's plan is to force White to expend moves defending the e-pawn and threaten to exploit the weak a-pawn. White's move was forced.} Ke5 39. Ne2 Be8 {Black decides to directly threaten the a-pawn to get a better position for the bishop. Black feels that immediate attempts to tie up the bishop by Bf7 and then invade with the king can be frustrated by a timely g4!?. Black calculates that the time it takes white to drive off the black squared bishop will leave the weak pawn at g3 vulnerable.} 40. Bb3 {As expected, but Black's plan is to defend and threaten to exchange the white squared bishops when the king can invade.} Bd7 41. Nd4 Kd6 42. Nc2 {Here White has once again prevented Black from invading, but Black has pulled pieces away from the king-side.} Kc5 43. Ke2 Bc1 44. Kd1 Bb2 {All part of the Black's plan, now White has to worry about the g3 pawn.} 45. Ke2 Kd6 46. Ne1 Bc6 {Black now threatens to invade after a bishop exchange while still retaining the threat of e5 followed by Bxp.} 47. Kd2 {White decides to stop the invasion that would occur after Bd5, at the expense of the g-pawn. } Be5 48. Bg8 {Hoping to exploit white square weaknesses, but Black is prepared.} h6 49. Bh7 Ke6 50. Bg8+ Kf6 51. Bb3 Bxg3 {Now Black finally wins the g-pawn and threatens to followup with the h pawn. White defends.} 52. Ng2 Bd7 53. Ke2 Kg6 54. Kf1 Kh5 {probing for weaknesses, White is forced to bring the bishop back.} 55. Bd1+ Kg6 56. Kg1 {Here white is losing space, more practical chances were offered after Ke2. } Kf6 57. Kf1 Be6 58. Kg1 Bc4 {tightening the grip} 59. Kh1 Ke5 60. Kg1 Kd6 61. h5 Kc5 62. Bc2 Kb4 63. Bd1 Kc3 {traps the bishop, forcing resignation}
