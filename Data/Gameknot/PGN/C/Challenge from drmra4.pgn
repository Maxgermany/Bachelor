1. d4 {This game is an example where "under-promoting" a pawn (the act of traversing the board with one's pawn and having it promoted to any piece other than the Queen) can lead to a tactical advantage.   In this case, I chose to promote my pawn to a Knight, which as it turns out gave me a significant advantage at the time, and gave quite a twist to the end of this game.    I would also like to say that by publishing this annotated game, I am in no way trying to indicate that I am better than any other player and I do not intend to belittle or humiliate any other player, most of all my opponent in this game.  In fact white is quite a rival, fun to play against and a gentleman.   } d5 2. Bf4 Na6 3. h3 e6 4. a3 g5 5. Be5 f6 6. Bg3 Nh6 7. e3 Bg7 8. Qh5+ {first check was white queen on move 8} Kf8 9.

Ne2 Rc8 {At roughly this point, I began to very closely inspect each move and ponder the various possible scenarios that could evolve with each choice.  It made the game very labor-intensive.  I could not just make a quick move.  Every move from then on required my entire attention for sometimes up to 30 to 45 minutes--and even then I'd sometimes put the move off until a later time if I wasn't close to timing out.  To make a hasty ill-advised or poorly thought out move at this point would be disastrous, and result in the loss of hours of hard work put into this battle of intellect and strategy.  } 18.

Nf3 Nxf3+ {the check by black knight on move 35} 36. Rxf3 Rc6 37. Rf2 Qb1 38. Kg2 Qb2 {It was at this point that I began to realize that I was wasting the strength of my pieces by having them so spread out, especially since white had managed to have all his most important pieces closely packed.  Still I felt that with white's pawns spread out, and mine more aligned to properly protect, I could take advantage of the natural defense that white's pawns were providing me and gradually work my queen back down to where I had carefully placed my rook to keep the white queen from a very simple checkmate if I were to leave the sixth row unprotected.} 39. c4 Qa3 40. Re2 Rd6 41. Qc3 Qc5 {I believe that about right here I began to see some very interesting strategical maneuvers that at least two thirds of the available moves would put me in the position to checkmate the white king.  However, the very careful moves by white kept me from gaining the tactical advantage I had hoped at this stage of the game.  I had to settle for trading rooks and advancing my pawns and taking only a one point advance in score.} 42. b4 Qc6+ {then check by black queen on move 42} 43. Kf2 e4 44. b5 e3+ {then check by black pawn on move 44} 45. Kg1 Rd1+ {then check by black rook on move 45} 46. Re1 Qb6 47. c5 Rxe1+ {Again by black rook on 47} 48. Qxe1 Qxc5 {This game has never been firmly in hand for either player.  However, the score has, in general, been slightly in favor of white, with brief moments of slight advantage to black and brief moments of slightly greater advantage to white. But this game is very interesting from perspective of how important it is to stay focused and to always consider the strength of your pieces when they are strategically aligned and taking advantage of their increased defensive capabilities when kept close to the side of one's king or a pawn.  This game also demonstrates that small moves are sometimes the only move available and when coupled with a small move in another piece can result in a more drastic change of circumstances.  At the time I decided to make this game annotated (following the white Queen's capture of Black rook on move 48) I had just for the first time since move 12 evened the score at -0- again. And both players had exactly the same pieces on the board.  There had been 10 moves to check the king, the first three came from white and the last 7 came from black.  From move} 49. Qe2 f3 50. Qxf3 e2+ 51. Kg2 e1=N+ {And now for the crowning move of my now certain victory: I advance my pawn at e2 for promotion, or in this case, "under-promotion" to a knight, enjoining white's queen and king in a fork.  Any other move, or even the choice of queen for promotion, would have led to my defeat.  Given the position of white's queen, I initially considered moving my queen to c2, which would have protected my pawn while still allowing room to guard my king if white chose to put me in check by moving his queen to f6. But had I done this, white would most likely have gone for the ensuing queen trade, since this would have left him with a considerable advantage: I would have no way of protecting my pawn at e2 from capture by white's king, and I would not be able to prevent white's pawn at b5 from promoting.  Other than the aforementioned moves, I also considered one other way to prevent white from checkmating and that was to move my king to g6. This would prevent the next move checkmate, but it would leave my pawn at e2 unprotected, and it was my only hope of winning, and that little pawn almost won the game for me single-handedly.   If anyone else could envision another possible way for black to achieve victory following white's move at 51, I would like to know.  By the way this game followed the first game between white and drmra4 in which white won, and his win was more decisive than mine.  I'm looking forward to our next match-up!   Chat at the time:  white: Great choice, Good job..... That's why i hate horses drmra4: It did not occur to me that I should go for the knight promotion until after I had gone through almost every other possible scenario twice or even three times and saw that you would have prevailed. And thinking I am going to check one more time and see if there was something I had missed...and there it was...the perfect solution! I was really very fortunate that the pieces were exactly where they were, otherwise you most certainly would have won. I am not saying you haven't won yet, just saying you would have definitely won if it weren't for the ability to choose any piece for promotion. } 52. Kg3 Nxf3 53. Kxf3 Qa3+ 54.
