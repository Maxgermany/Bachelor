[Opening "QGD (D53), Lasker variation"]

1. d4 {I approached this game carefully. My opponent was only 11 years old, and I was mindful of how I lost once to a Chester youngster with a similar age and a similar grade. https://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/chester7vpenyffordd2wirral-league?gm=49458} d5 {So he copies my first move.} 2. c4 {Queen's Gambit} e6 {Declined variation.} 3. Nc3 {Normal development} Nf6 {And from him.} 4. Bg5 {Bishop comes out.} Be7 {So does his.} 5. e3 {Preparing to develop my Bf1} h6 {he puts the question to my bishop.} 6. Bh4 {I drop back.} Ne4 {He plays the Lasker variation... known to be a bit drawish. https://www.chess.com/article/view/lasker-s-queen-s-gambit-declined} 7. Bxe7 {So I take.} Qxe7 {He takes back. } 8. Nxe4 {I take the knight.} dxe4 {He takes back - and the question is how to continue? I can see now in the opening databases that Ne2 is usually played here, but I was a bit afraid of the queen check on b4 and decided to stop it.  } 9. Qd2 {With this...Fritz prefers Ne2.} O-O {So he develops. } 10. Ne2 {Now the knight comes out. Fritz thinks it is level.} Rd8 {A fairly logical place to put the rook.} 11. Nc3 {I attack the pawn on e4 and prepare tp develop Bf1.} Nc6 {But what is this? Just gifting the pawn on e4?} 12. Nxe4 {So I take.} b6 {He prepares to fianchetto his Bc8.} 13. Bd3 {I develop mine, protecting the Ne4.} Bb7 {He continues to fianchetto.} 14. O-O {I castle.} Rd7 {Preparing to double rooks on the d file.} 15. a3 {Ruling out his knight or queen coming to b4 and also preparing to grab territory on the queen side.} Na5 {Hoping for a knight fork on b3. } 16. Qc3 {Which I prevent.} Rad8 {He completes his doubling manoeuvre on the d file.} 17. b4 {So I attack his knight.} Nc6 {Knight drops back. Fritz outs white as plus .97 now.} 18. f3 {This seemed sensible at the time, giving more protection to my Ne4, but I soon realised it is a mistake. He could now cause problems with 18......f7-f5, forcing my knight away and then continue with 19....f5-f4 undermining my pawn on d4 which is holding everything together.} Nb8 {Fritz agrees with me - f5 followed by f4 and white's advantage is down to plus 0.81 This move seems far too passive. I think his plan was c7-c5} 19. b5 {Which I decide to stop. I am planning on meeting c7-c5 with bxc6 e.p.} a6 {He tries to lure my pawn away.} 20. a4 {But I simply protect it. Fritz prefers f3-f4 here.} c6 {He attacks b5 again, but this leaves his pawn on b6 very weak. I was rather afraid of him playing c6-c5 next move, hence my reply.} 21. bxc6 {Fritz likes this move too!} Nxc6 {He takes back.} 22. Rab1 {I attack b6. Fritz likes this too.} f5 {But now this move comes in at last.} 23. Ng3 {I play this with the idea of meeting 23,,,,,f5-f4 with 24. exf4 Nxd4 25. Be4 and my Ng3 keeps the e2 square under control, stopping a nasty knight fork on that square. Fritz prefers 23. Nf2.} Ne5 {An ingenious move, if I take the knight on e5 then my bishop on d3 goes to his rook and the advantage has passed to black. Fortunately I don't have to take it.} 24. Bc2 {Fritz agrees that this is the best move, and give the position as plus 2 to white now.} Nc6 {He sees nothing better than retreating the knight.} 25. Ne2 {Now if he plays f5-f4 I simply take with the knight. There is no rush to take the b pawn, it can't escape.} Nb8 {Knight retreats yet again!} 26. Rxb6 {So I take.} Rd7d6 {He challenges the rook. Fritz also now likes 27. a5 protecting the rook, with plus 3 to white, but I do something else.} 27. Rfb1 {Also plus 3 to white.} Rxb6 {Black takes.} 28. Rxb6 {I take back, planning on meeting Rd6 with Qb4.} Qc7 {Attack my rook, but.....} 29. Rxe6 {But this goes. Plus 3.75 to white now.} Rc8 {With the threat of Qxc4 but I am ready for it.} 30. Bxf5 {Now 30....Qxc4 can be met with 31. Re8+ or with exchanging queens and then playing Re8+. In either case white has a winning advantage.} Qf7 {So his queen hurries over to protect his king-side} 31. Qd3 {I protect my bishop.} Rf8 {His rook comes over to attack my bishop again.} 32. Bh7+ {I throw in a check.} Kh8 {Forced of course.} 33. Nf4 {Protecting my rook and threatening a horrible check on g6. Plus 7.41 to white now, according to Fritz.} g5 {He gives his king some space. Fritz now likes Rxh6} 34. Ng6+ {But I prefer this way.} Kxh7 {He takes the bishop. Fritz is now crying out for Ne7+ but again I go along another path.} 35. Re7 {I decide to win his queen.} Qxe7 {This leads to his mate. Fritz thinks that Kg8 was best, but still gives it as almost plus 9 to white.} 36. Nxe7+ {White is mating now.} Kg7 {There is nothing better. https://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=220833} 37. Qg6+ {Queen check.} Kh8 {King retreats.} 38. Qxh6# {And is now mated.
