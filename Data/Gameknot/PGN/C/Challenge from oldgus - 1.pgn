1. e4 b6 2. d4 Bb7 3. Bd3 {I have very little experience against Indian Defenses so I'm flying fairly blind.} Nc6 4. Nf3 Nb4 5. Nc3 {5. Bc4 Bxe4 is no good for white so I must accept the loss of my light squared Bishop for a Knight} Nxd3+ 6. Qxd3 g6 7. O-O Bg7 8. Bg5 {I like my position at this point but perhaps that is related my inexperience with Indian Defenses} f6 9. Be3 {This is a wasted move as we will see in the Game Continuation. I should have taken the Bishop directly to d2} Nh6 10. Bd2 {Another option is 10. h3 preventing Ng4. But, I was concerned that black would start pushing pawns in a Kingside attack eventually bringing the King to safety on the queenside.} Nf7 {This was probably Black's plan all along and I wasted moves with my dark squared Bishop} 11. Rfe1 O-O 12. Qc4 {Pinning the Knight and setting up attacks along the c file. } Kh8 13. Nd5 e5 {Here I pick up the pawn for a Queen trade} 14. Qxc7 Qxc7 15. Nxc7 Rac8 16. Nb5 a6 {16. ... Rxc2 17. Nxa7 leaving Black an extremely weak b pawn} 17. Nc3 {Racing back to block the attack on the c pawn. I'm very happy with my position at this point.} exd4 18. Nxd4 f5 {This is the continuation that I did not see. My forward knight is attacked without protection and my e pawn is double attacked.} 19. Be3 {19. Nce2 Bxe4 20. c3 is much better for White but I'm still under the illusion that I can save everything at this stage} f4 {Too much tactics here. I'm attacked at all corners and there is no saving the piece now.} 20. Nf3 fxe3 21. Rxe3 Bxc3 22. bxc3 Nd6 {Black's pieces are moving with great coordination now attacking almost everything on the board.} 23. Ne5 {I'm trying to get some counterplay here} Nc4 {Forcing trades when up a piece is always good} 24. Nxc4 Rxc4 25. f3 Rfc8 26. Rd1 Rc4xc3 27. Rxc3 Rxc3 28. Rxd7 {I lose my doubled pawns for black's isolated d pawn but this does create a passed pawn for me and gained me a tempo with the attack on the Bishop.} Bc6 29. Rc7 Rc5 {OldGus commented to me later that this was a poor move letting my King out into the open. He though 29. ... Rxc2 was better and I have to agree although we never got to test if white could manage something from this position.} 30. Kf2 Rxc2+ 31. Kg3 Ba4 {Now I started counting how many moves it takes to queen my e pawn. In my mind it went like this: 32. e5 Rxa2 33. e6 Re2 34. e7 b5 35. Rc8+ and winning. Naturally that is if White plays horribly. White always has 34. ... Be8 but even then it ties up his Bishop and Rook guarding my dangerous e pawn. Naturally black has a far superior continuation as we see in the game.} 32. e5 {D'oh.} Rxc7 {Here I resigned as there is no hope for white although it can be stretched out for a bit. Eventually a pawn on the queenside will reach the back rank. I was happy with my play for the most part gaining a pawn but eventually losing a piece and then fighting hard until a huge blunder ended things.}
