1. g3 {This is one of many games I have played against spirit1. I know he likes to fianchetto his bishops thereby attacking the centre from a distance} c5 2. b3 {The gameknot database describes this as Benko's opening. It;s a slightly unusual one for me as black, however I wanted to push my pawns forward in the centre as I knew I would have the opportunity to do} Nc6 3. Bb2 {The first fianchetto} e5 {This restricts the diagonal of the fianchetto'd bishop and applies some pressure in the centre} 4. e3 {This is the first move that varies the move order in Benko's opening} d5 {This applies further pressure on the centre and opens the diagonal for my lsb. The disadvantage of this position is that it is tricky to get my dsb to a good diagonal, it is however supporting the c5 pawn should it be needed} 5. Bg2 {As expected} Nf6 {This returns us to Gameknot database Benko's opening territory} 6. d3 Bd6 {This is probably about the best square for my dsb at the moment and it opens up the kings side for castling} 7. Nd2 {Opening up possibilities of castling long, if he does however I am ready for a queen side assault} O-O {At this point there are two games in the Gameknot database and black won both. Although both sides are almost equal in development I prefer black at the moment as  I feel the peices are a little more co-ordinated for an assault.} 8. c4 {I have the option now of opening the game up by taking the pawn or closing the centre and possibly opening the e file with pawn d5} Be6 {In the end I opted for this to maintain pressure on the centre. I was also looking now to prevent him from castling if possible} 9. cxd5 Nxd5 {I wanted to keep my lsb and this also opened the diagonal for my queen as he will most likely castle on the kings side now. If I had taken with the knight he would probably be forced to Ng f3 preparing the way for him to castle. I didn't want to push him to making a move he wanted to anyway } 10. Ngf3 f5 {Putting further pressure on the centre and preparing for a push with my pawns} 11. e4 {I think this is probably a mistake, in his position I would be strongly tempted to castle, pretty much completing development. my threat of pawn to e4 would probably come to little} Nf6 {I'm happy for him to take the pawn as it gives a half open e file and If I get to open the file I can pressure his king} 12. O-O f4 {reopens the diagonal for my bishop and cramps the white position further, the white queen has limited options} 13. Nc4 {Threatens the bishop and the e pawn. however if he takes the bishop I retake with my queen and can then put a rook on d to pressure his d pawn which would be difficult to defend.} Bg4 {Pinning the knight and relieving some of the pressure on my e pawn} 14. Qd2 {removing the pin and threatening c3 which puts even more pressure on my e pawn} Qd7 {Links the rooks which is almost always good, also means that  15 ... bh3, 16 bxb, Qxb applies some pressure to his king} 15. Nfxe5 {Finally it falls and he has two strong knights in the centre} Nxe5 16. Bxe5 Bxe5 17. Nxe5 Qe6 18. Nxg4 Qxg4 {He has completely demolished the centre however my forces are not too badly placed for an attack} 19. e5 {Threatening to take my b pawn} Nh5 {This applies pressure to his pawns with my f rook well placed to provide support} 20. Bxb7 Rad8 {Possibly no tthe best move but it puts the rook on a half open file and resigns the white queen to defending a pawn} 21. Rad1 {This move seems uneccessary to me however it does mean that the queen can move away, leaving only a rook defending the pawn} f3 {This is a key move for me as it blocks off his bishop from the defence of the king. His options are limited now and taking the b pawn with that bishop is beginning to look like a mistake. My queen still has her eye on h3.} 22. Qe3 {forced} Rd4 {This protects the c pawn that the black queen is eyeing up. with hindsight I think I should have been looking at doubling my rooks on f, though I didn't realise it during the game} 23. Rdc1 {Still after that pawn} Qh3 {Definitely too early. Rd-f4 would provide much more of a threat} 24. Bxf3 {All of a sudden my threats are reduced significantly} Rxf3 {I felt at the time that I needed the knight more than the rook. I still felt that the game was winnable at this point} 25. Qxf3 Nf4 {HE can't take with the pawn or he loses his queen and if he moves the queen off the h1-a8 diagonal I can mate in one with Qg2} 26. Qa8+ {This is a distraction, I figured I could get my king safe enough} Kf7 27. Rxc5 {This is a mistake, as my knight poses a far greater threat to his king as we shall see} Ne2+ 28. Kh1 {forced} Qxf1# {Thanks for reading. Any constructive comments are welcome}
