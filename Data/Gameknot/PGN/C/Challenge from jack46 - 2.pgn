1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Qf6 {Yikes. This just invites trouble.} 4. Nc3 {Obviously threatening 5. Nd5.} Bc5 5. Nd5 Qd6 {Pretty much the only move.} 6. c3 {6. 0-0 was possible too.} a6 7. d4 {Mixing things up. If 7... axb5, 8. dxb5, Black's Queen must move away from the defense of c7.} exd4 8. Bf4 {This may be "book" or not, but I found it on my own. Now Black loses c7.} Qg6 {If 8... Qe6?, Nxc7+ wins the Queen. This was his only move, incidentally eyeballing White's g2 and e4, although to take either would be to invite more trouble.} 9. Nxc7+ Kf8 {Here, 9... Kd8 was better, I think.} 10. Bxc6 {I thought about Bd3, but Black gains time that way with 10... dxc3, 11. e5?!, Qxb2, 12. Rf1, and Black has survived.} bxc6 {This is probably the right recapture, reserving the possibility of ...d6, blocking off the Bishop's protection of the Knight at c7. Black also now has the b-file for his QR.} 11. O-O Ra7 {Here, 11... Qxe4 was not possible because of 12. Re1!, Qxf4, 13. Re8=.} 12. Nxd4 d6 {The previous note applies here too. Now White must think about how to defend the Knight at c7.} 13. Nb3 {This handles it for now. If 13... Rxc7, 14. Nxc5. Now Black should try 13... Bg4, 14. Qd3! (not 14. Qd2, Bf6!++), Nh6, 15. h3. White still has the edge, since the Bishop has no good retreat, and the other Bishop can't move from c5 without giving the d-pawn.} Qxe4 {Hoping, perhaps, for 14. Re1, Bxf2+, 15. Kxf2, Qxf4+, 16. Kg1, Rxc7, winning.} 14. Bxd6+ Bxd6 15. Qxd6+ Qe7 16. Rfe1 {Same story with the mate threat at e8. The White Queen is taboo.} Be6 {Good move, except for the tiny detail that White can capture with check, gaining a move and saving his pieces that appear en prise.} 17. Nxe6+ fxe6 18. Rxe6 {Entering an endgame two pawns ahead.} Qxd6 19. Rxd6 Rc7 20. Nd4 c5 21. Ne6+ {Good enough to force a Rook exchange.} Ke7 22. Rad1 {But first...more pieces in play!} Ra7 23. Nxc5 Nf6 24. Re6+ {Just a nudge before taking the a-pawn.} Kf7 25. Rxa6 Re7 26. Kf1 h5 27. f3 g5 28. Rdd6 Ne8 29. Rd7 {Forcing more exchanges, now that the pawn majority is overwhelming.} g4 30. Rxe7+ Kxe7 31. Re6+ Kf7 32. fxg4 {I might have held onto my 4-pawn edge, but Black's Rook will not really pose a danger at h2. Still, 32. f4 might have been better here.} hxg4 33. Re4 Rxh2 34. Kg1 {If 34. Rxg4, Rh1+, 35. Kf2, Rb1 and White must defend his Q-side pawns.} Rh5 {If instead 34... Rh4, 35. Nd3, Nf6, 36. Rf4, Kg7, 37. g3, Rh6, 38. Ne5+.} 35. Rf4+ Nf6 {This allows the exchange of the remaining pieces, giving White an unstoppable pawn storm.} 36. Ne4 Rh6 37. Rxf6+ Rxf6 38. Nxf6 Kxf6 39. Kf2 Ke5 40. a4 {}
