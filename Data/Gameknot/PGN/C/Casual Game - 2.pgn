[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 d6 2. d4 e5 {The Swiss local plays the French defense. :-) Of course, there's no such opening, to the best of my knowledge, as the Swiss defense.} 3. d5 c6 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {The struggle for White's Q5 is intensifying.} g6 6. Bg5 {The pin is mightier than the sword.} Bg7 7. Qf3 {I remember playing games with my friend 20 years ago. He always did believe that a good attack is the best defense.} O-O 8. O-O-O cxd5 9. cxd5 Bd7 10. Nge2 {White's spatial advantage is obvious. Black must find a way to free his game.} Na6 11. Kb1 Qe7 {If the Q moves off the diagonal, White wins a piece with BxN BxB QxB.} 12. Rc1 Rfd8 13. Nb5 Nb4 {In my inexpert opinion, 13... N-B4 is the better move.} 14. Nc7 Rab8 15. g3 a5 16. h4 b6 {A useless demonstration. The K-side is where the action is.} 17. Bh3 Bxh3 18. Rxh3 Rb7 19. g4 Ra7 20. Nb5 Rb8 21. h5 a4 {Black's Q-side attack has taken too long to develop. White's punch lands first.} 22. hxg6 hxg6 23. Rch1 a3 {Ignoring the danger on the other side.} 24. Bh6 Bxh6 25. Rh3xh6 axb2 26. Qxf6 {A smooth sacrifice.} Qxf6 27. Rh6h8+ Kg7 28. Rh1h7# {He's caught me out like this more than once. Well played.}
