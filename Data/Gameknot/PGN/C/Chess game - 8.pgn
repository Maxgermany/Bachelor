1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 Nc6 3. Bc4 g6 4. Qf3 Nf6 5. c3 {!?  This features a bit of a ponzaini opening without the hole of the e pawn, trying to d4 later} Bh6 {Bg7 is probably better} 6. Na3 {developing the knight} O-O 7. d3 {getting ready to develop queen bishop} Bg7 {why does he keeps dwaddling with his bishop? Bxc1 is better.} 8. Bg5 {developing the bishop, pinning the knight.} h6 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Qe3 {I probably would be better if I Ne2.} Bg7 {why do he keep moving his bishop?} 11. Nf3 {At least Qe3 lets me play Nf3.} d6 {open lines for his bishop.} 12. O-O a6 {huh? preparing to b5?} 13. Bd5 {just not letting bishop getting attacked.} a5 {looks like he is not trying to b5...} 14. Bxc6 bxc6 {He has a B pair and I have a N pair but my pawn structure is better.} 15. Rae1 {I moved the wrong rook.} a4 {what's this?} 16. Nc4 f5 17. Red1 {getting the wrong rook away.} Qe7 18. exf5 gxf5 {shoudn't traded. His center is full of pawns and I cannot exploit his weak kingside.} 19. Rfe1 {finally I putten the rooks into the right place.} f4 {but now my queens being attacked.} 20. Qe4 {a blunder. I allowed a fork.} d5 {and I resigned}
