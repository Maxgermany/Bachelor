1. h3 {a crazy game. I had lost a few times to ken so tried a new opening h6 the basmans or something.} c5 {Ken goes for a Sicilian, and you will see combines with a kings Indian we out the book already. } 2. c3 {not text book, the analysis suggests e4 but we not computers} d6 3. e3 a6 4. d4 {straight in for the fight challenging the c5 pawn} cxd4 5. cxd4 {i took with the c pawn to maintain the king side pawns} e6 6. Bd3 {the first major piece to move } Nf6 7. Nc3 g6 {perhaps an error the bishop is going to the g7 square so i start thinking of black square movement as it is out the game a bit} 8. Nf3 Bg7 {as predicted} 9. O-O {get the king safe and let the game begin} O-O 10. Re1 {ok rook to a central file but we still shadow boxing after early exchange} Nc6 {contesting the centre squares preparing d5 } 11. a3 {blocking off the knight advance} Bd7 {still shadow boxing setting things up for the attack} 12. Bd2 b5 {even i would say but this move seemed a waste} 13. b4 {cannot let the b pawn advance further} d5 {ken moves into the centre but i think e5 better} 14. e4 {I immediately contest} Nxe4 {and we draw swords} 15. Nxe4 dxe4 16. Bxe4 {a series of exchanges, i would imagine that we both felt happy with things } Rc8 {looking to get a rook on a open file} 17. Bg5 {go for the lady hot things up a little} Qb6 {fine get out clause attacking e4} 18. Be3 {triple protection} Qc7 {still very even} 19. d5 {ok lets force things a long a little} exd5 {maybe a better move on not sure knight d8} 20. Bxd5 Nb8 {a slight error better bishop e6} 21. Rc1 {now a can see some options first make life difficult for the lady} Qd8 22. Rxc8 Qxc8 {then really shake it up with the exchange} 23. Bc5 {and kaboom squeezing things at the back and its now that i can see the mad combination seven/eight moves and it all looks good} Re8 {may be he sholud have sacrificed the rook} 24. Bxf7+ {so now i commit to the combination everyway i looked at it i came out on top with either a big win or a good end game.kens no coward so he gives as good as he gets.} Kxf7 {that's cool queen can go into action but first lets get the knight involved} 25. Ng5+ {this move took ages to go for i kept thinking of the queen check and thereafter} Kg8 {maybe i would have brought the king out i had worked out combinations for this ken took me by surprise but as i had a good look i could see that i could win outright.} 26. Qd5+ Kh8 {serious error} 27. Nf7+ {and i move in for the kill} Kg8 {the rest is forced} 28. Nh6+ Kh8 29. Qg8+ {and i love this } Rxg8 30. Nf7# {a knight checkmate a text book or chess puzzle ending}
