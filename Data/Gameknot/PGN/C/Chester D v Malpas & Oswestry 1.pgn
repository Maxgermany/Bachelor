1. d4 {This what yet another loss to this talented youngster, still only 17 years old.} f5 {He plays the Dutch Defence as last time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Defence} 2. Nc3 {I play a slightly different move order to our previous game. http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/malpas-oswestry-1-v-chester-1?gm=64183} Nf6 {He prevents e2-e4 - for now.} 3. g3 {I fianchetto again. I think around here I noticed that the board was the wrong way round(with h8 on my left hand sife, not a1) and I insisted it was set up right, so we had a little break while we set it up again.} g6 {He plays the king-side fianchetto too.} 4. Bg2 {I complete it.} Bg7 {So does he.} 5. e4 {We have now transposed into the previous game. We were both blitzing out our moves at high speed.} fxe4 {He takes.} 6. Nxe4 {I take back.} Nxe4 {He takes again.} 7. Bxe4 {I take again.} d5 {He attacks my bishop as before.} 8. Bg2 {8. Bg2 is the only move in the opening databases I use. On f3 the bishop blocks the f2 pawn and could be vulnerable to attacks by the rook down the f file. For instance 8. Bf3? 0-0 and how is white going to complete the development of the king-side?} Nc6 {And now he breaks with the previous game. I had to start to think. I have to deal with the threat to my d pawn.} 9. c3 {This is the most commonly played move for white here.} e5 {Excellent move by black, it prevents his e pawn remaining backward on the semi-open file, like he mistakenly did in our last game. He played the move quickly, from memory. } 10. dxe5 {After a think I took.} Nxe5 {And he took back instantly. Don't you just hate it when your opponent is better prepared than you? Now I had a long think. Do I take on d5 or not? If so what do I take with? Later I found this gameknot game where white took with the queen and lost quickly. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17990219&mv=17&rnd=0.5109989752169874 and the Gameknot computer gives 11. Qxd5 as a mistake. However there is also this game where white managed to play 11. Qxd5 and win http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x685463&mv=21&rnd=0.5267607547382092 In the databases white normally did what I did, and play another move. } 11. f4 {After the game Danny told me that he thought this was the best move for white. He once again played his next move very quickly, and I sunk into thought again.} Bg4 {What now? Eventually I moved and it was not what he had expected.....} 12. Qa4+ {It was this! I half expected the game to end in a quick draw now! 12....Bd7 13. Qd1 Bg4 14. Qa4+ etc. After the game Danny thought this wasn't very good, but I see now that it has been played before. White lost quickly in Bopp Thomas (2187) vs. Renner Christoph (2448) after 12.	Qa4+	b5 13.	Qxb5+	c6 14.	Qb7	O-O 15.	fxe5	Qe8 16.	Bxd5+	cxd5 17.	Qxd5+	Be6 18.	Qa5	Qc6} Qd7 {But Danny played this, which perhaps lets me off the hook. As well as 12.....b5!? Fritz likes 12....Nc6, another move I was thinking he may play.} 13. Qxd7+ {I take.} Nxd7 {He has to take this way, otherwise he just loses the knight. Now the question is - take the pawn or not take the pawn.} 14. Bxd5 {At the time I thought "well queens are off the board now, it is going to be hard to whip up a winning attack with the queens off" - but I was wrong! Fritz suggests 14. Be3 with slight edge to white.} O-O-O {Fritz likes this move. } 15. Be3 {Fritz prefers 15. Bf3} Rhe8 {Fritz likes this move too.} 16. Kf2 {Virtually forced, in order the save the bishop.} Nf6 {I like this move, I think it is good, and it lays a trap into which I fall. Fritz thinks Nc5 is better. Ok so where should white retreat the bishop to?} 17. Bf3 {This seemed to be a mistake, but afterwards we played some variations, and white does have a tough position to play, so I am not 100% sure there is anything better. OK what did Danny play now?} Bxf3 {Is that what you would have done?} 18. Kxf3 {If I had taken back with the knight he has Nf6-g4+ winning a piece.} Rd3 {But now he has a winning pin. Only one way to defend the bishop....} 19. Re1 {Like so.} Nd5 {And now I can't protect it again and it is lost. I played it out, but move-by-move account is no longer necessary.} 20. Nh3 Nxe3 21. Ke2 Rd7 22. Kf3 Rde7 23. Re2 Nc4 24. Rf2 Re7e3+ 25. Kg2 Re3e2 26. Rb1 h6 27. Ng1 Re2e1 28. Rxe1 Rxe1 29. Nf3 Re7 30. Nh4 Re6 31. b3 Ne3+ 32. Kf3 Nf5 33. Nxf5 gxf5 34. c4 Bd4 35. Rd2 c5 36. b4 b6 37. bxc5 bxc5 38. h3 h5 39. Rc2 Kc7 {And I finally resigned. Many thanks for reading, hope you would it entertaining and educational!
