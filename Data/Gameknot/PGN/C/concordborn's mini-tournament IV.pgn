1. f4 {This is from a tournament game that went pretty well for me} e5 {Starting point of the tournament, this is the Bird, From gambit} 2. fxe5 Nc6 3. Nc3 {I played this move for variety really, my natural instinct would be more towards protecting the pawn, possibly with d4} Nxe5 4. d4 Ng6 5. e4 d6 {While I am sure its valid I don't like this move from black, it blocks his dsb, I guess with the intention of c5} 6. Bc4 c6 {I don't understand this move, it seems to me to waste a tempo when black is already behind in development} 7. Nf3 h6 8. Be3 {I think looking at it now I might have been better to fianchetto this bishop} Nf6 9. Qe2 {My intention here was to line my queen up with the black king} Be7 10. O-O-O Bg4 {I think if I were black I would have castled here, this move allows me to start pushing my pawns forward. } 11. h3 Bd7 12. e5 {I'm looking to prevent black from castling} dxe5 13. dxe5 {Black suddenly looks a little cramped} Nh7 {pretty much forced} 14. e6 {maintaining pressure} fxe6 15. Bxe6 Nhf8 {now blacks king is surrounded I want to get my bishop or my queen onto the h5-e8 diagonal, though the knights could be a nuisance} 16. Bb3 {Although this move may not seem the best, the bishop did not move for the rest of the game and proved influential at the end} Qc7 17. Qc4 {threatening Qf7 though of course black can castle, if he does then I have Bxa7 and nc5 at my disposal} Be6 18. Nd5 {Clearly cxd5 loses to Qxc7} Qg3 {I think this is a mistake from black as it takes his queen away from the defence of his king, though he has few options for his queen} 19. Bf2 {Qxb loses to Nc7+} Bg5+ {Again I am not sure how much this achieves as it takes another defender away from the black king, I can pin the lsb to the king with Rh-e1} 20. Kb1 cxd5 21. Qb5+ {I played this in preference to Ba4+ as it keeps open the option of Bxd5} Bd7 22. Qxb7 {Possibly not the best, Rh-e1+ might have been better} Qxf2 {Although black is ahead on material his position doesn't look that good to me} 23. Rhe1+ Ne6 24. Qxa8+ Ke7 25. Qxd5 Rd8 26. Qd6+ Ke8 27. Rxe6+ Bxe6 28. Qxe6+ {Black resigned.  thanks for reading please comment}
