1. a3 {?! Ok, this is, nowadays, a common move with people who are learning the game.  However, I pointed something out that is good to take note of.  In it, I said, In general, advancing the a pawn early in the game is something that you don't want to do. Better is to advance a central pawn because this is what you call a non developing move, a move that does not develop anything. The idea is to develop your pieces and central pawns to control the center. So, better was either 1.e5 of 1.d5  Then, he told me that he sees joveyboy1 play this a lot, and btw, I know him because we're friends on GK.  So, I said, ok, that's a common thing that I've been seeing. The thing is that you generally will wind up better when your pieces are developed because the general idea is to fight for center control, so you can contest the center. The one who does it first, generally has an advantage.} e5 {However, as I saw with database, which I'm more careful with, but agreed and would've played it anyway.  But, this is the most common move to developing the a pawn early.  The idea is that while the opponent advances a non center pawn that doesn't help control the center, you can then use that time right away to develop something on the center.  The idea is that a head lead in development is important, and this way, one gets to start exploiting weaknesses.} 2. c4 {I don't know why he played this as it's no longer an English Opening and can't transpose into one since the a pawn isn't developed.  The problem here is that it also does not develop or help control the center.  With that, I'm going to bring another piece into play.} Nf6 3. e3 {While it might not appear, as you generally don't want to play e3, as guideline.  In this case, it doesn't apply, and this is actually a good move.  The thing is that 3.e4? would lose a pawn, as I would capture with my f N.  Now, I could develop my DSB, but will wait until my next move.  That's because when he develops his c N, I don't want to give him the option of exchanging on the e file with NXP.  So, in this case, 3...Nc6 will prevent that. } Nc6 4. Nc3 {At this point, he said, "Knight protected"  Well, I don't agree or disagree, as the N was protected in the beginning.  If he meant that this move protects it, then I don't.  But, if he meant that he doesn't have to worry about for now as it's safe, then he is correct.  In it, I said,  Yes, for now it is. And, this is a common move, in response to bringing out my c N.} Bc5 {But, now I get to play this, and the idea behind it is to castle, on my next move.} 5. Bd3 O-O {And, now I finally get the opportunity.  One thing worth noting is that this is what I was thinking and how I was planning to do all of it, since my second move.} 6. Nf3 d5 7. cxd5 {At this point he accurately said, "Pawn trade" So, my response was Yes. And, it is a known variation. It's called the exchange variation, and unlike most variaitons, they come in different shapes and forms. Exchange variations=a variation that involves a number of exchanges.  And he said, "Ok."} Nxd5 8. Nxd5 Qxd5 9. O-O {?? He said, "Castle."  I understand why he played this as the idea is to castle early and often to get your K to safety.  However, this is a blunder and an occasion where guidelines must be broken to avoid losing material.  In it, I said, normally, that's the best move. But, the problem is that leaves your LSB en-prise.  And, he responded by saying, "Oh yea" So, I responded by telling him that, in this case, best was to either play 9.Bb5 or retreat back to the seventh rank, or play 9.Bb1 The idea is castle early and often, but at the same time, it's important to access the position of say, what's hanging, does the move played present a risk. Can it be taken, and what can my opponent. And always be ready for anything and everything, or as they say, "Expect the Unexpected."  @superandy: That's about doing your HW and another example of being your own spectator.  One thing to note is that there are general principles, which aren't rules but guidelines.  However, if following them means a mate from your opponent or loss of material, then the guidelines have to be broken. } Qxd3 10. b3 Bg4 11. b4 Bd6 12. Bb2 {?? Ok, the move here looks very good because he does develop his last piece on this square.  But, as you'll see with the next move, what looks good might be bad.} e4 {In it, I said, 12.Bb2?? was a blunder, as you see. So, I had to repeat myself in order give the example of where, sometimes there are exceptions, in which, you can't follow the guidelines.  In it, I said, I understand why you played it. The idea was for development. Now, it's generally a good idea to follow General Opening Principles. But, the thing is that those principles aren't rules, but rather, a set of guidelines to help in your games. The idea is to get your pieces out and control the center, in the opening. However, as you learned just now, there are exceptions to them, occasions where you can't follow those guidelines. } 13. Qb1 {Then, I said, What's important is looking at everything, accessing the position by asking yourself if the opponent can win material, mate you, and if you're going to find yourself in a difficult situation, trouble, with that move. If any of those answers are yes, then this is when you can't follow those guidelines. And, this is one of those times. Best, in this position, was believe it or not, 12.h3 And, now 12...e4, would be a blunder as that you would win a piece back. If instead, I played 12...Bxf3, you can take back with the h pawn or Q, and it would wind up as an exchange.} exf3 {?? An outright blunder.  In fact, with this move, I felt very upset with myself, that as a coach, I made a blunder that I should not have overlooked.  That's especially when I'm training to train someone not to do this kind of thing.  In fact, I lost a little sleep over this.  What happened is that I overlooked something very important and forgot what the master mater said of, "Be a spectator of your own game" which I will point out during the end.  Forgetting that the Q move to d3.  Why, so that if I take, here, he'd win my Q which is what happened.  One thing to note is that despite my average time per move being at least 10 hours, I moved way too quickly here, so I don't always go by average time per move, as noted in the GK related forum.  However, it's why I always emphasize to take your time and not move quickly.  Even when you think you know the best move, you don't and what looks good might be bad so it's important to give yourself enough time to fully access the position.  I bring this up because in the WTWLTR easy19 said that I moved too quickly there.  Well, for the most part, I disagree with that assessment since I was voting on main lines, but at this point, that was the case. } 14. Qxd3 {In it, he asked, "Is that a free queen?"  So, I said yes, and that I overlooked that. It's as important to pay attention which I overlooked, which makes an oversight.  And, that's why it was a blunder that shouldn't have been made.  So, with best play from white, the game is lost for black.  However, I'm not giving up, yet.  And, I'm not going to make it easy for him to win, for if I do, he won't take me seriously again as it will come too easy for him, which I don't want because it's not as good for learning purposes.  But, @superandy: This is important to think about from the previous mistakes.  Best here was to exchange with 13...Qxb1.  Now, imagine if I played this move, instead.  What would have been outcome?  Well, in order to avoid being a Q down in addition to what you've lost, you would've had to take back with 14.Rxb1 which is that liquidation that you don't want since you'd be forced to exchange while down material.  So, after taking back, then I could play this a move later, so 14...exf3 15.Bxf3, so in addition to what was lost and exchange, you'd lose another piece.   Now, that's something to think about because in general it's important to also assume as though you're opponent will find the best response, in which case, the opponent would have a winning advantage.   } Rad8 {But, at this point, however, I do have a plan against white.  Will it work, however?  That remains to be seen.  Keep in mind, that white doesn't have to allow it.  What it boils down to is that since I'm now in a lot of trouble and a desperate, this is where it pays to be really aggressive, as opposed to, getting nervous.  For if I get nervous, then his advantage will grow, and white will be able to win it, without any problem.  He still should win, but like I said earlier, I'm not going to make it easy for him.  } 15. g3 {At this point, he said, "Oh no, ur not going to do a discovered attack on me. I know that move. Played that many times against my friends when down a queen"  And, It told him, while repeating what I mentioned a few moves that it's good he realized that.  The idea is because of what happened earlier, about looking and accessing the position.  In that, I'm proud of him because what it shows is that he already learned something, in this game.  But, I also told him something important, as well.  That is, I almost overlooked another move, now knowing how easy that is, but this next move should be more then just that.  Meaning, that in short, it's a discovered attack, but in the long run, strategically, this what I'm about to do is a little worse then a discovered.  Still, he has a winning advantage, but must be careful and can't become overly confident, as we'll see later on.} Be5 {This was a small part to my plan, but there's more to it then meets the eye, as noted earlier.} 16. Qb1 {A good retreat square.} Rxd2 {But, this was my actual since my fourteenth move.  The idea is that now he takes, my B, and when I take, I've exchanged my B for his N.  Now, it might not seem special and did learn that usually B's are worth more then N's, in the long run.  But, in this case, a N is actually worth more.  It's not the same but somewhat similar to a position between GM's Petrosian and Spassky.  By exchanging, there is a lot of damage my is about to cause, especially when I capture on e5.} 17. Bxe5 Nxe5 18. Rd1 {Correct.  With any other move, it would take a while to realize the damage, but I would launch a devastating with 18...Bh3.  It would be a while, but after I attack and he pulls back, my next move would be 19...Nd3, and if he took my N, and I'd take my Q, but if not, I'd play 20...Rxf2, with the threat of 21...Rg2+, and because of the B on h3, no matter what he'd do, mate would be unavoidable with either a discovered mate so 22...Rh2# or if 23.Rh1 23...Nxf2#  That's also why 14...Rad8 was more then just a discovered.  However, white, in my opinion, found the best move to prevent this situation.  Therefore, the only way for white to prevent mate would by giving up his R for my N, so while he still have an edge, some of my advantages, however, would have come back, at this point.} Re2 {Since I'm down material, I refuse to allow liquidation, an exchange, without a good reason for doing.  In this position, there's nothing that can black can get by doing that.} 19. Rd5 Nc4 20. h3 c6 21. Rd1 Bxh3 {The idea was not to make up for lost material, believe it or not.  There is another reason which is even better.  First, the idea is to protect my B.  Now, I could've retreated, but the reason I didn't is because with this move my B is dangerous.  I'm already coming up with a strategy.  It will take a lot of moves, but with the B there, and then other pieces in that area, things will start getting dangerous for white, if he's not careful.  Not all of this is my goal, meaning just mate in stuff.  However, what I'm saying about having to be careful is what I wanted for teaching purposes.  The idea is that even though you're ahead and have extra material you still have to be careful because the idea isn't to relax, but instead, think about how you can keep your advantages.  Now, letting your guard is what usually throws away people advantages, and more often then not, is how people go from having an advantage to a disadvantage.  And, this is also why players are sometimes able to pull swindles.} 22. Rd4 Nxe3 {The move looks bad as I just gave him something despite being behind.  However, this was no blunder, and there was a strategy behind this.  Something important to think about it.  } 23. fxe3 {?? Having said that, this move is a blunder.  While it wasn't forced, I figured, however, that he'd take it.  However, the plan was to give up my N like this.  Why?  Before doing so, my f pawn was effectively blocked by his f pawn.  By letting him have my N, not only do I have a passed pawn, but the f pawn is now extremely dangerous.  I'm not sure what the best move would've been, but because of what he played, with best play from both of us, this is now a draw.  Before this move, white had a winning advantage.  The idea here is that when one gives something away, you must ask yourself, and figure out if it was blundered or if there was a plan behind it.  If the opponent has something in mind, then don't take as you don't have to.  A good example was in my game against Jack, where like with easy19, I met my fate against.  I wound up blundering away material, so I had to figure out something and this kind of thing has worked.  So, I gave him a pawn, knowing that if he took, I'd be able to mate.  But, this time, he did not fall into that trap.  In it, he said, "You're giving me a pawn.  I don't have to take that pawn."  Instead, he forced a Q exchange.  To note: my Q is how I would've mated, had he taken my pawn, instead.  After the unwanted liquidation, there was no hope left for me as he got a passed pawn that proved to be a killer.  Well, on a smaller scale, the same thing applies here.  @superandy: As the saying goes, "To take is a mistake".  Sometimes, especially against stronger players who give things away, be careful because they often give things with a plan behind it.  And, if you're not aware of it, it can and usually does spell trouble.  The other thing worth noting as I learned from GM JP, is that sometimes, tempii is more important then protecting or winning material.  By taking my N, you gave me the time I needed to get this passed pawn.  And, unlike before, I'm not going to make anymore lucky, so as the master mater puts it, ..."brace yourself."} Rg2+ {According to the post game analysis, this is a blunder.  Instead, better was to check on f2, so 23...f2+ with the idea that I'd promote and exchange.  And, that way I'd compensate and now be ahead 4 points, as opposed to, 3 points down.  For that reason, I did consider that move as I saw that to.  But, having said that, I absolutely disagree with this analysis, only because there was a plan behind.  However, it'll take about 10 moves or more which shows just how far ahead I was thinking.  The idea here is that white must be careful, for if he isn't, I will eventually be able to mate him.  Having said, the idea is putting pressure on the K side.} 24. Kh1 Re2 {The idea for me was to make room for my f pawn.  The idea, but this is not what I was going to do, per say, as then you'd have cheapo tactics too obvious to drive.  But, the idea was only to start formulating and looking for ways to threaten mate with my B, R, and f pawn.  Of course, I know that my opponent doesn't have to allow, so I'm figuring that if I even attempt he'll prevent find the best moves to get out of it only to find myself with problems.  So, I'm not going to allow it, but instead, I'm just looking for opportunities, and see what possible weaknesses he might have.} 25. Rh4 Bg2+ {Obviously, putting pressure on his K and forcing him to figure which two places, he'll put the K.} 26. Kg1 {Another option was 26.Kh2.  I'm not sure which is better, I thought this was the right choice, as otherwise, it appeared that I'd be able to force a win.  But, I studied, and that isn't the case.  Either way, this is a drawish position.  If both players find the right moves, I envision that it will end in a draw either by stalemate or repetition.} h6 {This is a move that I very nearly overlooked.  Instead, I wanted to play 26...Rd8?? immediately, and very nearly made this blunder and overlooked what would've come.  But, this time, I remembered the easy19's advice about being your own spectator, so I looked at everything only to realize that if play 26...Rd8, he'll mate with 27.Qxh2#  Now, as noted earlier, this is something that I won't allow, for if I do, he won't take me seriously or listen to me again.  Therefore, I still want him to be able to learn, so I can't make this mistake.} 27. Rg4 {?? A serious blunder.  And, with it, I now have the advantage.  He was worried about me winning his R with 27...g5, but best was 27.Rd4 as that would prevent me from playing 27...Rd8?? as noted earlier.  For now, if I do so, he has the immediate 28.Rxd8  But, with this move, I either double on d2, but in order to prevent it, he'd be forced to give up his d R without compensation.  So, no matter how you slice it, the advantage is handed back to me as I will compensate.} Rd8 28. Qb3 {?? The losing blunder.  However, it doesn't lose right away.  But, with this choice, sooner or later, the game falls apart for white.  In this position, the only choice was to give up his R, by playing 28.Rd4, as I was alluding to earlier.  The idea is that with this move, I'm now able to and take advantage of the opportunity to double up here.  And, all afterwards, once I play 29...Bh3, mate will become unstoppable, sooner or later.  @superandy: The idea is that you can't allow your opponent to double up, right near the home square.  Once this happens, especially when I have another piece, like the bishop nearby, pieces are well coordinated, so it generally leads to inevitable mating sequences.  } Rdd2 29. Rf4 Bh3 30. Qxf7+ {Understandable that he wanted to check, but it doesn't do much because I can and will get out of danger.  And, if 30...Kg8, instead, 31.f8, and I can still get out with 31...Kh7, so to save time I'll play ...Kh7 right away.  While it wouldn't matter much, my idea is to teach and help white remember the importance of tempii and how much you really need it because wasting it can sometimes mean disaster, as is the case here.  And, the idea is to set a good example for him.} Kh7 31. Rxf3 {Ok, remember when I said that 28.Qb3?? was the losing blunder.  Well, this time, the move played instantly loses.  I figured that he'd take this pawn.  Why not, whites ahead and so taking would generally increase.  But, remember that sometimes taking is a bad idea.  Unlike the last time, this time, the capture instantly leads to an inevitable sequence as we're about to see which, one way or another, I was not going to overlook.  @superandy: So, as noted, always ask yourself why I gave something away because as was the case with 22...Nxe3, this is not a blunder for the reason that I outlined.} Reg2+ 32. Kh1 {32.Kf1, was his only other option.  However, it's still mate.  Why?  After that comes 32...Rh2+  Now, if 33.Ke1, I instantly mate with 33...Rhe2#  Or, he can play 33.Kg1, but then comes 33...Rdg2+ 34.Kf1 (forced), Rh1#.  } Rgh2+ 33. Kg1 Rdg2+ 34. Kf1 Rh1# {As I shortly pm'd superandy afterwards, white played respectively north of his rating.  If I were to evaluate, I'd say more like a 1200 rated player.  The morals still are as he can learn from my mistakes.  Meaning: That between his and my mitstakes, there are a few lessons that can be learned.  First, "Be a spectator of your game."  For example, after white made mistake that lost a piece, and he then made another that allowed me to take another piece, but I made one by overlooking that my Q was left en-prise, and by doing so he won it.  With best play from superandy, the game would've been lost for black.  And, it's also the fact that when he threatened mate with his R and Q, which I nearly overlooked, I figured out what happened by looking at the entire board and not allowing him to mate me.  Second, while it's good to follow guidelines, sometimes, one must break them, if it'll cause you problems, like the loss of material.  The is principles are just guidelines, as opposed to, rules.  Third, "To take is a mistake".  Sometimes, you evaluate and figure if giving away something was a blunder or there was a strategy underlying.  Henceforth the saying, unless there is a tactic.  Like here, when I gave up my N and a P, the idea was to give myself the time needed to come up with a devastating.  And, one thing to note, is that this where tempo becomes more important material.  Last but not least, "When you think that you have won or are in a winning position, be very careful and do not underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise, you might start making mistakes and losing the game"  So, when you're ahead and think that you're gonna win no matter what, you always think it through and figure what your opponent is capable of doing.  Instead of relaxing or getting super confident, it's better to still spend the time studying the position, so that the opponent does not have time to make that move.  @superandy: If you can remember these lessons, I'm confident that you're rating will sorely up 1200 before you know, quickly.  I can see this potential in you because of how well you've played, and how serious of a player you really are.}
