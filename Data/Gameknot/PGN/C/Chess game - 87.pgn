[Opening "French (C06), Tarrasch, closed variation, main line"]

1. e4 {White opens e4.} e6 {I go for the French defence} 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. Bd3 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ne2 cxd4 8. cxd4 {Most popular line in Gameknot World Database up to this point.} Qb6 {2nd choice in the database 603x (8...f6 4,577x)} 9. O-O {White castles and offers the d (gambit) pawn.} Nxd4 {I decide to take the pawn. Surely white's attack can't be that strong?} 10. Nxd4 Qxd4 11. Nf3 {White attacks black's Q and defends the e-pawn.} Qb6 {Black retreats, so has lost 2 moves of development for the pawn.} 12. Qa4 Bc5 {Bc5 prevents Be3 and Re1} 13. a3 {Still in the World DB. Threatening to drive the bishop away with b4.} a6 {Black plays a6 creating a retreat square for his queen and preventing Bb5. This is the first move not in the World DB. Omens are not good though... in the Gameknot DB 13...a6 has 100% (3x) win for white.} 14. Bd2 Qa7 {White gets further ahead with development} 15. Qg4 {...and shifts his attach to the king side} g6 {Black prevents Qxg7, but black squares become weaker. (The alternative of castling or Kf8 look like suicide!)} 16. b4 {White grabs more space and drives away black's bishop. } Bf8 {I would probably have played this anyway to defend g7 and h6.} 17. Be3 {White can finally play Be3 and black's queen is hit again. That pawn is getting more and more expensive! } Qb8 {Black retreats but hits the pawn on e5.} 18. Qg5 {White decides to defend e5, but this doesn't look like the best square for his queen.} Bg7 {More pressure on e5 and freeing the back rank.} 19. Bd4 {White defends d4 again.} b6 {Creating space for the B on c8, but what if white takes the open c file with his rooks?} 20. Rfe1 {Fortunately white now seems obsessed with defending e5.} Bb7 21. Qe3 {White puts pressure now on b6 so I defend with Qd8} Qd8 22. Ra2 h5 {Maybe it's my turn to try and attack.} 23. Ng5 {Now I'm worried about sacrifices on (Bx)g6 or (Nx)e6 or (Nx)f7.} Bh6 {Pinning the N should help.} 24. f4 {White defends his N, breaks the pin and prepares to attack up the f file.} Rg8 {Preventing f5.} 25. Nh3 {h5 looks better.} Rc8 {Well if white doesn't want the c-file maybe I can have it!} 26. Qf2 {Undoing the pin.} Kf8 {Now I'm short of both time and ideas!} 27. Rf1 Kg7 28. f5 Rf8 29. f6+ {Surely fxg6 was better?} Kh7 30. Qe2 Kh8 {Phew! I have reached the time control with seconds to spare. White has 10 minutes. Now we both get +15 minutes to finish the game.} 31. g4 {White goes for the kill! Black's bishop is doomed and the king would quickly follow. e.g. 32 gxh5, gxh5 33 Qxh5...34QxB...  35 Qg7 mate So what should black do now???} Rc4 {Time for desperate measures! At least I've got white thinking...} 32. Bxc4 dxc4 {The diversion has worked! White wins the exchange, but loses his strong bishop and black has a passed pawn on c4 and my bishop on b7 is active at last.} 33. g5 {White continues to trap my black bishop, but now my king looks safer. Surely gxh5 would still win.   Now what should black play??} Nxf6 {33...Nxf6! hits the Bishop on d4 and gives me hope with 3 pawns for the piece.} 34. exf6 Qxd4+ {Now white must be careful, for it's my turn to have mating chances.} 35. Rf2 {The best move. Both 35.Nf2 and Qf2 lose quickly. } Qc3 {Hitting the N on h3.  35...Qd5 threatening 36...Qh1 mate fails to 36 Rg2 or Kf1} 36. Nf4 Bxg5 {And the black bishop is free!!!} 37. Nxh5 {White can grab this pawn with impunity, since gxNh5 loses quickly, but he has overlooked my next move.} Qc1+ {I hope for 38. Rf8, when ...Be3+ wins the queen.} 38. Qf1 Qxf1+ {So I exchange queens} 39. Kxf1 {Not RxQf1, Be6+} gxh5 {And win the N.} 40. h4 {Now we are both short of time. White tries for a direct attack on my king up the h file.} Bh6 {I can't risk it.} 41. Rae2 b5 42. Re5 Kh7 43. Rxh5 Rd8 44. Rf4 Rg8 45. Rd4 Bd5 46. Ke2 Rg6 47. Rf4 Kg8 48. Rf2 {At this point the game descends into farce with me in terrible time trouble. White sportingly agreed a draw after several more moves made in the last minute on the clock.} Bc1 49. Re5 Rg3 {}
