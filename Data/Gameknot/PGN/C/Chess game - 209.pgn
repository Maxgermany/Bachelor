1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 {This is where the game leaves common lines. I feel like after Nxe5 Nxe5 Qxe5 I can achieve a strong game but I was looking to play a more tactical and interesting opening today} g6 {I plan on tucking my king away with g6, Bg7, and 0-0 that way I can open the game up without worrying about my own king} 4. Bc4 c6 5. dxc6 Bg7 6. d3 O-O 7. cxb7 Bxb7 {I now am down two pawns but certainly not without compensation. I own the h1-a8 diagonal, my king is safe and I have some strong open files to pressure :)} 8. Nf3 Nc6 9. O-O Qc7 10. Ng5 {It is quite common knowledge that trading two active minor pieces for a rook and a pawn is no good but my opponent was unaware.} Rad8 11. Nxf7 {This exhange is only going to help my development. Two of the three minor pieces what has developed will soon be traded off which is a plus for me. Also I now have pieces on the h1-a8 diagonal,  the h2-b8 diagonal; my development is completed and I have a rook on a half open file facing whites queen} Rxf7 12. Bxf7+ Kxf7 13. h3 Nd4 14. Be3 Qc6 {I realized my opponent wouldn't allow me to mate him on g7 but I figured I could hurt his pawn structure} 15. f3 {I was right :)} Nh5 {now if Bxd4 then Bxd4+} 16. Bxd4 Bxd4+ 17. Kh2 Qc7+ {If for some reason my attack is to fail I can always gain back material on c3 after an exchange} 18. f4 {Not Nxf4 because then g3 and i drop my knight} Kg7 19. g3 e5 {I think this move just seals whites fate. If fxe5 then Qxe5 threatens mate and if f5 then Bxc3 and e4 also threaten mate} 20. f5 Bxc3 21. bxc3 e4 22. fxg6 {a terrible blunder} Qxg3+ 23. Kh1 e3+ {white resigns 0-1}
