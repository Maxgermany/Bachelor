1. e3 {Unless White is intentionally playing a Reversed French or a Nimzo-Larsen, several moves are stronger...} d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 {3.cxd is stronger. } e6 4. h3 {Since the B is never coming to g4 and there are no realistic threats based on ...Ng4, this is an unnecessary weakening of the normal k-safety place.} Be7 5. Bd3 {5.Nf3 or 5.Be2 are better. 5.d4, transposing to a standard Queen's Gambit is also very good. } dxc4 {not best for Black. } 6. Bxc4 O-O 7. Nf3 b6 {...c5 is better.} 8. Qe2 {8.d5 is better. My guess: prevent ...Ba6 which would be to White's advantage after Bxa6 Nxa6. } Bb7 {...Nc6 to be considered. } 9. O-O c5 10. e4 {oops. 10.d4 is much better. } Nc6 11. e5 Nd5 12. Ne4 {12.d3 is must move. White missed ...Nf4 winning. } Qc7 {...Nf4, 13.Qe3 Ng6 and the e-button must drop. } 13. d3 {13.Bxd5 is must move. } Nxe5 14. Bf4 {OOOPS! Many options to Not Drop The Bishop... } f6 {white missed ...Nf3+, 15.Qxf3 Nf6 winning a piece. } 15. Bxd5 Bxd5 16. d4 {16.Bxe5 avoids losing the piece. } Nxf3+ 17. Qxf3 e5 {17....Qc6 MUCH better, threat is ...f5 winning the N.} 18. dxe5 {...e5??? 18.Nf6+! and 19 Qxd5+ and 20.B moves.} fxe5 19. Qd3 { 19.Nf6+ is still better.} Bxe4 20. Qc4+ Kh8 21. Bg3 Qb7 22. f3 Bd5 23. Qg4 Bf6 24. a3 Rf7 {24...e5 is much stronger. (opens bishop at b2 and breaks into white's King.} 25. b4 {25.b4?? lets Black open up the king position or drops the exchange to 25....e4!      ,,, 25...e4 26.Rae1 exf3. } cxb4 26. axb4 Bxf3 {again: e4!. this gives back the piece, though Black is still better with two extra pawns. } 27. gxf3 e4 28. Rad1 exf3 29. Rxf3 Bd4+ {NICE Move!} 30. Kg2 Rxf3 {30...Raf8 is better, keeping the pin. then swapping all major pieces the extra pawn on each wins makes the win most likely. } 31. Qxf3 Qxf3+ 32. Kxf3 Bf6 33. Rd7 {33.b5 better} g6 34. Ke4 {34.Rb7 better.} a5 35. bxa5 bxa5 36. Kd5 a4 37. Bd6 a3 38. Bxa3 Rxa3 39. Ke6 Bh4 40. Rb7 h5 {40....Rxh3 better.} 41. Kf7 Rf3+ {41....Kh7 much better} 42. Kxg6 Bd8 43. Rh7+ Kg8 {43.Rh5 makes it all even. R vs R+B. } 44. Rg7+ Kf8 45. Rh7 Rxh3 46. Rxh5 {46......RxR is an efficient end. game is drawn with care by white. } Re3 47. Rh8+ Ke7 48. Kf5 Kd7 49. Rh7+ Kc8 50. Kf4 Rc3 51. Rh8 Rc4+ 52. Ke5 Rc7 53. Ke6 Rd7 54. Rh3 Re7+ 55. Kd5 Bc7 56. Rh6 Kd7 57. Rh5 Bd6 58. Kd4 Kc6 59. Ra5 Kb6 60. Rd5 Kc6 61. Ra5 Rd7 62. Kc4 Rc7 63. Kd4 Kb6 64. Rd5 Rd7 65. Kc4 Rc7+ 66. Kd4 Kc6 67. Rf5 Rd7 68. Rf6 Kc7 69. Kc4 Kc6 70. Rf5 Rb7 71. Kc3 Rc7 72. Kd4 Rd7 73. Kc4 Rc7 74. Kd4 {}
