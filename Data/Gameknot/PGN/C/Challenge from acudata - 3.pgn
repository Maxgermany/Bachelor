1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 {!! I like it, tends to take most players out of book and out of normal development.} 5. Nb5 a6 {This is your gamble.  If W takes the defensive track and returns to N-c3, you build an advantage.  However, I chose the move aggressive N-d6+ giving me the tempo. } 6. Nd6+ Bxd6 7. Qxd6 Qf6 8. Qd1 Qg6 9. Nc3 d5 {Small point.  I think that supporting the center by developing your Queen's Knight is stronger then attacking immediately with d5.  Although, I see that you are offering the tempation of exd5 which would turn the game back to even.  Actually, a good gamble.} 10. Nxd5 Qxe4+ 11. Be3 Nd4 12. Nc7+ Ke7 {!!! Ke7 saves your position, where Kf8 loses immediately.} 13. Rc1 Bg4 {!!! Bg4 brings the game back to even.} 14. Qd3 Qxd3 15. Bxd3 Rd8 16. h3 Bh5 17. f4 f6 {?? Turning point of the game.  Kd6 forces Nxa6, etc.} 18. g4 Bf7 19. fxe5 fxe5 20. O-O Bg6 21. Bc4 b5 22. Bxd4 Rxd4 23. Bb3 Nf6 24. Ne6 Rd2 25. Nxg7 Nd7 26. Nf5+ Bxf5 27. Rxf5 Rf8 28. Rcf1 Rxf5 {Good trap!  pxr would shift the game to your favor.} 29. Rxf5 a5 {Nc5 would have been much stronger.  This is where I think your busy schedule got you to feel rushed.  Essentially, he end of the game.} 30. g5 Rd1+ 31. Kg2 Rd2+ 32. Kg3 a4 33. Bg8 Rxc2 34. Rf7+ Ke8 35. Bxh7 Rxb2 36. g6 Rb1 37. Kg2 Rb2+ 38. Kf3 e4+ 39. Kxe4 Rg2 40. Rf5 Rg1 41. Ke3 Re1+ 42. Kd2 Re7 43. h4 Nf8 44. Rxb5 Nd7 45. h5 Nf6 46. Rb8+ Kd7 47. Rb7+ {Hope this helps. Best regards, Ray }
