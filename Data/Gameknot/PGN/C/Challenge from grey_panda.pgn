1. e4 {Smothered Mate And Curses.  How NOT to play chess.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nd4 {My favourite opening but this time my opponent tries a less used approach to it.} 4. Nxe5 {I'm greedy. And I get a shot at that f7 pawn right?} Qg5 5. Nxf7 {Well this is all going swimmingly isn't it.} Qxg2 6. Rf1 {Thank you, MY rook.} Qxe4+ {Ah. This is where I start to realise that the wonderful start has somehow gone somewhat wrong. Still I can stick the bishop back and just lose the knight. So one minor piece, not so bad huh?} 7. Be2 Nf3# {Oh. I'm just going to go and cry now. That was MEAN!}
