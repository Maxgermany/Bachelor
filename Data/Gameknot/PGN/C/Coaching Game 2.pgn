1. e4 b6 {Joe: I like this since it's something different. Without knowing the best response, I'm thinking of 2.d4 only because they say that after 1.e4, if black only advances a pawn one square, it's generally best to play 2.d4 A perfect example would be in the Caro Kann where 1...c7 is played, and white answers with that move.  Ken: 2.d4 is the most common move here, and quire playable} 2. d4 Bb7 {Joe:  Now, it's about what to do. My e4 pawn is attacked, and there are a few ways to protect it. I think that the best move would be 3.Nc3 as this develops.  Ken: a very standard move  } 3. Nc3 e6 {Joe: That is an interesting move. I'm not exactly sure what to do here but am thinking of 4.Nf3 to continue with my development.  Ken: 4.Nf3 is a very reasonable and standard idea} 4. Nf3 Bb4 {Joe: One thing I don't like is the pin. Were it not there, I would consider bringing my Bf1 into play right away. But, I remember Jack Stockel implying that, in general, you don't want the pin there. And, he mentioned that the most, and usually best, way to get out of it is with the bishop. With that being said, I think that I'm best off with 5.Bd2.  Ken: with a knight on f3 or f6 what Jack told you is right, but it is wrong when the knight is on c3 or c6. think a bit more here  Joe: Yes, he was alluding to the King's Knight. So, I am thinking about bringing my Bf1 into play with the idea of castling. The only question is which square. I like the looks of Bd3 where there is an added defender to my e4.  Ken: that is a common way of playing here} 5. Bd3 Ne7 {Joe:  As with a different annotation, I think castling is a good idea at once. One reason for playing Bd3 was to castle.  Ken: I don't see a better move} 6. O-O O-O {Joe: Now that you have castled, I'm planning to complete my development with my Bc1. I'd love to play Bd2, but as you pointed out, it's not a good move. I would also consider Bg5 with the idea of pinning your Ne7 which can be broken with ...f6 Therefore, I like the looks of Be3 as both of the Bishops are together. But, I think that best is Bf4 as the DSB appears to be better placed then any other square.  Ken: Here you have a wide range of reasonable moves. That's both good and bad for you. Great to have so many good choices, but the sheer size of the move tree with all these branches can lead to confusion. That is why I chose this defense, so that you will be forced to think for yourself because the database won't be much help. A lot of good plausible moves to choose from. It will come down to deciding which type of position makes you most comfortable.  Joe: That makes sense. The irony is that I don't even look at the database because unless you know why they suggest moves, it won't help to listen to it, as I learned with tactical-abyss. Yes, it's what I like to do here. I am interested in Be3 don't know what happens afterwards.  Ken: It is a reasonable idea, and we both will learn from working our way through the variations.  Joe: I was thinking along a variation, but after the first lesson about exchanges, combined with a mistake in the team game where I got a lucky, in which you gave an example of when not to exchange, I'm not so sure. I was thinking along the lines of 7.Be3 with the idea being 7...d5 8.exd5 But, I'm not sure that exchanging is the right approach. Or possibly 7.Be3, c5, but I'm not comfortable along the line after that. What it boils down to is me trying to avoid the exchange.  I also considered moving my Nc3, but I want to complete development, as opposed to, moving the same piece twice.  Ken: sounds logical  Joe: Which one, Nc3 or Be3.  I meant Be3 or Ne2.  Ken: both are logical. a matter of preference. Which p[osition do you like more?  Joe: I like Ne2 the best.} 7. Ne2 f5 {Joe: I'd normally wait to take f5 in order to prevent exchanging. The problem is that you would get a free pawn because of your Bb7. So, I believe that exf5 is my only option. The only other move that doesn't lose anything would expose my King badly after something like 8.e5?!, which allows 8...Bxf3, as now, I'm forced to recapture with the pawn right next to the monarch.  Ken: I agree e5 is bad, but look a little more, there are other plausible choices  Joe: I looked at another option which I don't like as well because this semi restricts my Bc1. It's Ng5 to add a defender to e4.  Ken: This is one other way, try a bit more  Joe: It's 8.c3 which is not only an alternative to the problem but just might win a piece, in a few moves. It's about what comes after that. I think that c3 is the way to go here.  Looking into it, I don't, but it prevents the loss of material, so it boils down to the best move. I think that the attack is solid.  Ken: now that you studied all the options, take a bit more time and decide the one you like the best. This is the point here in playing such a flexible defense. I have given you a lot to have to think about.  Joe: You have, and there is one other option that I missed being a3, with the same idea as c3, but it creates a semi open file for my Rook. I'll have to study all of them and will have a difficult time deciding which is best.  Ken: That is the one of the reasonsthis type of defense works. It overloads the opponent with a lot of appetizing choices, and even at this slow speed it can be overwhelming.  Joe: I agree with you. I've limited it down to two or three choices. One thing for sure is that I need to be very careful here.  But, I think I've figured it out here.  } 8. a3 fxe4 {Joe: I figured that you'd played this. I think that axb4 is the best option as it prevents the loss of a piece. Aside from that, I don't see any good alternatives.  Ken: check a little more about the order of the moves, and yes, you absolutely must not come out of this a piece down.  Joe: I can also play 8...fxe3, with the idea of 9.Bxe4, Bxe4, 10.axb4 I think that's better as not only haven't I've blundered a piece, but my King is a lot safer since I'm not forced to capture with the g pawn, that way.  Ken: Your most recent chat(note) is kiond of garbled. I think you mean that I can plaY fxe3, not you. But either way recheck your variation out to at least move 11.  Joe: I was thinking along the lines of 9.Bxe4, Bxe4 10.axb4, but after 10...Bxf3, I'm in rough shape as I'm forced to expose my K in order to prevent the loss of a piece. So, it appears that the only move which does any better would be 9.Bxe4, but after 9...Bxe4, 10.axb4, Bxf3 I'm still in rough shape for the same reason. So, there's no way to prevent the K exposure, as those are the only ways to avoid coming out a piece down.  So, I'm in bad shape, either way. It's about figuring out which of those two variations works better for white.  On the other hand, similar to the other games, and it's the opposite of what it should be since the pressure is on. I checked out a different variation that works out a lot better for white, so I feel much less pressure. In fact, I now feel little to no pressure and more comfortable about my position feeling that I know what to do, even though, it's, technically not supposed to be how it works, as you noted, in our first game when the pressure was on and I felt it. The new variation would be something like, 9.Nf4, exf3 10.axb4, fxg2 11.Nxg2, Bxg2 13.Kxg2 Yes, the King is open, and we don't always want exchanges. But, in that context, unlike with the first game, it would be forced, and I'd find that exchange beneficial because more of the pieces around the open K is what leaves it exposed. By having the pieces exposed, my monarch is much safer.  Ken: I guess we will find out how safe it is. I am glad to see you diving into the position in depth. check you variations a bit more still before you decide. There are one or two plausible vartiations you should still lookat.  Joe: I did check out a couple of variations, and it's not that safe but still the best option available. With some of these lines, I still have more options then the other variations that I checked out.} 9. Nf4 Bd6 {Joe: This takes me by surprise, but with the move played, however, I feel even more comfortable about my position. I'm now thinking about Be3 to complete my development.  Ken: the N cannot stay safely on f4 with my B on d6 and my R on f8  Joe: You're right. I overlooked the Rook, as there are three attackers against two defenders. I think that Nh5 would be the way to go here.  Ken: look some more, there are 2 other way to protect yourself, a biy more subtle  Joe: The only sensible move I can find is Qd2, but it doesn't work because after 10...exf3, 11.gxf3, I'm down to the equivalent of a piece, and my King becomes exposed since the Queen is moved from the proper diagonal.  The other thing which I can see failing is giving you a free piece in order to threaten, which you just drive off, anyhow. That variation would be 10.Nh3, exf3 11.Ng5, fxg2, to allow 12.Qh5, but 12...h6 stops the threat.  Ken: a piece is lost no matter what, but you have to find the variation that does the least damage, explore 10. Ne5 and 10. Bxe4 before you decide  What you will need to work on for the future is adding the mobility of the pieces to your judgement of position. A static assessment isn't enough.  Joe: I did look at a different variation from another angle, and after you play ...h6, I'd have Bh7+ winning back a Rook for Knight. But, I'm going to look at those other variations that you mentioned.   I looked at the other two variations. I don't like Ne5 as well because instead of ...Bxe5, dxe5, I feel that it's worse if you play ...exd3, and even if I'm to take back, I feel that my Nf4 is more important. With that being said, I like 10.Bxe4 the best, and if then 10...Bxe4, I feel a little more comfortable after 11.Ng5 with a little more mobility and a somewhat similar threat to what I mentioned earlier. And, the B is reattacked, in return.  Ken: Congrats, you've examined all the relevant variations.! Now you get to choose. } 10. Bxe4 Bxe4 {Joe: Now that you've taken back in the way that I thought you would, 11.Ng5 comes to mind which is why I took. The idea is attempting counterplay with a difficult variation, but not that difficult to drive off. Ng5 will free my Queen, so that, I can threaten mate with 12.Qg4  Except that it doesn't work. The variation failed because it was a case of Ghost Vision, which is typically a bad sign. It's on the same diagnol as your Bd6 which would lose another piece. Therefore, I've got to get my Nf4 out of danger. I don't like since my K side is weakened anyhow plus getting a cramped position from that but feel that Ne2 is my only option. Just when I thought it was starting to get good again, which is where I typically go wrong also, the position is deteriorating for white, and more then just the loss of a piece.  Ken:  all true, but it isjust stuff that we all have to work on continuously to improve. My weakest point as a player is tactical depth of vision. I see a lot, but I misscertain things too.  Joe: I agree. It just takes time. That weakness that you said is something that a GM, from what I heard about has and lost a game because. He wasn't just a GM but one of the best players in the world. I believe it was Caruana.  I like the looks of Nd2 or Ng5 and think that there is still something to learn. Could be wrong but am interested in where that would take me.  What I like about Ng5 is that it'll enable me to complete my development. The variation, hopefully mobile enough that I've got in mind after wards is to play something like 12.Be3 where not only is development completed, but I've added a little pressure on the d file.  Ken: about the best move possible} 11. Ng5 Bf5 {Joe: This I'm sure will be driven off. But, it does give me a very small amount of hope for compensating for loss of material, even when the threat does get driven off. So, I'm thinking of Qh5 to threaten mate. The only question is what happens after ...h6 is played?  Actually there's no threat there. So, I'm thinking that instead, I would play Be3 to complete development.  Ken: quite true, no mate there, so look some more  Joe: However, I found a move similar to that. It can be driven off, but I might be able to pose as a threat against black with a lost of tempo. With that being said, I'm thinking of Qf3 to threaten your Rook.  Ken: Certainly a threat that cannot be ignored. I must say I'm surprised, but happy for you that my position is as dangerous as it is.  Joe: I agree. It is interesting.} 12. Qf3 Nbc6 {Joe: I figured you'd play this. With the threat against my d4, combined with, wanting to complete my development, I'm thinking that best would be Be3.  Ken: there are other ways to protect d4. look at those too before you decide  Joe: True. The other options are c3 or Ne2. I don't want to play Ne2 as I'm afraid that I won't be able to find a better outpost, then after, leaving me with a cramped position, that is, unless, Nc3 is to become a good move, then after. But, I like c3, however. It's based on that, but why I also mentioned about the B was development, though, it's no so important at this stage since we're in the late mid game.  Ken: ok. I think you've analyzed it all.  Joe:  The only thing that I didn't analyze is the one other way to defend. And, I like it even better as it not only appears to win back material, but might wind up giving me an advantage in what would be similar to a swindle. That would be 13.d5 with the idea being 13...exd5 14.Nxd5, Nxd5 15.Qxd5+, Kh8 16.Nf7+ I do think that black can do something in one of these lines to prevent that, but it'll be difficult.  Ken: nothing stops me from responding to 13.d5 with 13..Nd4  Joe: Allright, that brings me back at two of those other variations.  I looked at the chat since it was those two moves, and I figured out what to do here.  } 13. c3 Bxf4 {Joe: I was trying to figure out what to do here. So, I know that I need to back. I think that taking back with the Bishop is a little better as that way, I can complete my development.  Ken: I agree that taking on f4 with the B is safer, but not an extraordinary amount safer  } 14. Bxf4 h6 {Joe: I also reckon that there's not a lot of good moves available, at this point.  Ken: true the position is difficult here  Joe: I think that Ne4 is the way to go. Not only don't I lose more material, but I'm not forced to place my N on the rim, in return.  Ken: The only other possibility is Qg3, but it does cost a knight} 15. Ne4 Bh7 {Joe: I am the kind of person that's into centralizing both rooks. With that, I'm thinking of Rfe1 as that would enable me to play Rad1, later on.  Ken: that overlooks a threat, look again. Hint, if you play Re1 one of my knights will move immediately to cause you harm  Joe: Yes, ...Ng6 is a problem as mate is threatened against me since the Q and N would work well as you later have ...Qh4, etc. Therefore, I think that the position demands Qh3. Even better would be g3, though.  I can't even play that, and the threat is worse as you'll win a second piece in the same way that you won the first piece. Yet, there's no good choices that are going to prevent this. That's because if I move the B, I lose my Queen, so that's not an option.  I think the best move available is to give up the N with Qg4, in returning, I'm threatening to take on h6 which also threatens mate. You can drive it off, but I think with some difficulties since your DSB was exchanged. Aside from that, I've got no idea what to do.  Ken: the only other plausible move is g3, but I don't think those variations will be any happier.  Joe:  It's better, but you can still play ...Ng6 or even worse, if there's something that I don't know about. } 16. g3 Nd5 {Joe: At this point, Bd2 comes to mind to prevent further liquidation.  Ken: that allows Rf8xQf3, and I don't think you want that move played  Joe: I don't. But, you've got an added threat against my Bf4. So, at the same time as protecting my Queen, I'm also trying to figure out how I can prevent further liquidation because due to being ahead, your goal is to exchange my Bf3 for your N. I know as that's why you played ...Nd5. So, my goal is to prevent that, whilst, keep my Queen protected.  I see that there isn't, however, so I'm thinking of Qd3, in an attempt to put some pressure on your Queen side.  Ken: Qd3 would walk in to an immediate pin after 17. Qd3 Nxf4 18. gxf4 d5!  Joe: So, that's not an option, and neither can I play Qe3 for the obvious reason. Aside from that, the only other moves I see as sensible would be Qe2 or Qd1. I prefer Qe2 to leave my Rooks connected.  Ken: Qe2 is the best of your two choices, and Qg2 is very similar  Joe: Which one of those two is better?  Ken: I'd call it dead even.} 17. Qe2 Nxf4 {Joe: Although I don't like the position, I think the only move for white is gxf4. Not ready yet, but believe it or not, I think that it's almost a resignable position since this forces my monarch to become exposed. And, then after, you win another pawn.  Ken: yrs, you are in a difficult position.  } 18. gxf4 Rxf4 {Joe: My only options are Nd2 to avoid getting my N pinned or losing the N.  Actually, the pin is needed, as otherwise, I lose my Queen, after Qg4+. I feel that walking into it is the only way to avoid further loss of material.  Ken: f3 is playable, as is Ng3  Joe: Which one is better?  Ken: f3 is very slightly better, but both positions are difficult} 19. f3 Bxe4 {Joe: Now, I am forced to take back with fxe4. I'm just not sure what's going to happen, after you play ...Qg5+  Ken: I believe your best after Qxg5+ is to play Kh1} 20. fxe4 Qg5+ {Joe: I think so to. I was about what happens after Kh1. I'm interested in that part.  Ken: I will double the Rooks on the f-file.  Joe: That makes sense because there's added pressure.  I agree that Kh1 is the best move.} 21. Kh1 Raf8 {Joe: This position becomes difficult. I'm thinking that instead of liquidating right away, hitting your Queen with Rg1 would be better.  And, I am thinking about what happens if you play ...Qf6 which I'm ready and prepared for.  Ken: my guess would be you play Rxf4 and I follow with ...Qxf4  } 22. Rfg1 Rf4f2 {Joe: I was thinking of e5.  I did anticipate this.  I think that best would be Qd3 to avoid further liquidation.  Ken: Qd3 fails after I play ...Rxh2+ and you get mated check the variation.  Joe: This is going to force me to liquidate Queens then with Rxg5, which is the last thing that I wanted to do.  Ken: yes, it is designed to do exactly that, force the liquidation down to an endgame that is, as the GM's say a simple matter of technique (meaning an easy win a piece ahead).  Joe: Yes, I'm about ready to resign here. I was thinking along the lines of Rxg5, but Qxf2 came into consideration. But, I gave this more thought, and the reason I stayed in this long is that I felt that there was more for me to learn with the Queen's still on the board. But, without them, I feel that there's nothing else to learn.  Ken:  If you play Rxg5 I play Rxe2 and you will have to move R(g5) allowing me to play R8f2 doubling the Rooks. If you play Qxf2, I play Rxf2 and you follow RxQ which I follow with hxRg5 and it liquidates down to your R and 6 pawns against my R, N and 7 pawns, which is a simple win.  Joe: With that, this is where I resign. I enjoyed the coaching, so I guess that lesson 2 is to look at things from the more mobile perspective, as that's how I lost material.}
