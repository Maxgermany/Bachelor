[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C61), Bird's defence, Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nd4 {Birds Defense to the Ruy Lopez.} 4. Nxd4 exd4 {Blacks Idea in this defense is to eliminate the traditional struggle that takes place for the center and the d4 square by simply occupying it with his pawn after recapturing the knight.  This hinders whites immediate advancements in the center but at a price.  Black has lost a tempo (move of development) by moving his Knight twice in the opening and has given white a pawn majority to work with on the king side.} 5. Bc4 {White would do better to castle here in order to best capitalize on Blacks last moves.} Nf6 {Black makes a bid to seize the initiative} 6. e5 {White is reluctant to relinquish it.} d5 {!} 7. Bb3 {another tempo lost by white in being forced to move the Bishop a third time!! 7.} Bg4 {From here on in it is black that dictates the terms.  This move sets the stage for one of the most amazing series of forced moves ever to be played.} 8. f3 {only move.  } Ne4 9. O-O {if 9.fxg4 Qh4ch 10.g3 Nxg3 leaves white in trouble} d3 {!!  The beginning of the end.  The type of pawn move that black just played is typically referred to in chess as a leaver (a sacrificed pawn that leaves the opponent with severe weakness) note the lack of hope that whites Bishop on c1 and Rook on a1 have in getting into the game. The pawn move also clears the deadly g1 a7 diagonal for blacks dark squared bishop.} 10. fxg4 Bc5+ 11. Kh1 Ng3+ {!!!} 12. hxg3 {only move} Qg5 {Threatening Qh6 mate} 13. Rf5 {only move.  intending to block the queen check on h6 by playing Rh5} h5 {!! now if 14.Rxg5 hg check 15.Rh5 Rxh5 Mate} 14. gxh5 {only move to stop the immediate mate} Qxf5 {Black again threatens mate by capturing on h5} 15. g4 {only move} Rxh5+ {!!} 16. gxh5 {Forced} Qe4 {Threatening Qh4 Mate also white can not move his g pawn to try and avoid the mate and if 17. Kh2 Qhf is still Mate  17.Qg1 Qh4ch! 18.Qh2 Qe1ch! 19.Qg1 Qxg1 Mate} 17. Qf3 Qh4+ 18. Qh3 Qe1+ 19. Kh2 Bg1+ {!!} 20. Kh1 {only move} Bf2+ {that check from the black bishop on the previous move allowed black to gain a tempo and reposition his bishop on f2 where it cuts off whites escape square.} 21. Kh2 Qg1# {This is my favorite short game :)}
