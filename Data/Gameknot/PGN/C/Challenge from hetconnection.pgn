[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {I had just met this opponent in blitz - we played an interesting game, and afterwards he challenged me with the same variation.} c5 2. Bc4 {I seem to be coming up against this variation a lot. } Nc6 {2 ...e6 is solid - I sometimes like to defer it in the hope of transposing into something like a Dragon.} 3. Nf3 e6 {....but white's attack on f7 can be troublesome, and in this game I decided to cut it out.} 4. d4 {Transposing to an Open Sicilian. I head for a Paulsen type of formation.} cxd4 5. Nxd4 Bc5 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. O-O d5 {Maybe I should have played ...a6  first. What follows, although not frightening, was not exactly what I had in mind.} 8. exd5 cxd5 9. Bb5+ Bd7 10. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {I was not particularly worried by the exchange of light square bishops. In many variations of the Open Sicilian white lives to regret the light square weaknesses.} 11. Be3 Bxe3 {I didn't really want to exchange dark-squared bishops, but took the opportunity to isolate a pawn. I could have played Qc7, but I was anxious about  the fact that I was still two moves from castling.} 12. fxe3 Nf6 13. c3 {I wasn't sure about this move. It may have been intended to strengthen the pawn, liberating the queen from its defence - but in fact it turns into a chronic weakness.} O-O 14. Qd4 Qb5 {The idea of the queen manoeuvring  here is to create weaknesses in the white pawn structure.} 15. b3 {Now the c-pawn is weak, and will become a focus of pressure.} Rfc8 16. Nd2 Qc5 {With the weaknesses on e3 and c3 and my rooks already moving onto the open files, I didn't mind transposing into an endgame. I normally prefer tactical middle games, but with both pairs of bishops off, I figured a middle game was more likely to develop into a slow slogging match. } 17. Rac1 Qa5 {Of course, not solving white's structural problems for him by exchanging on d4. I try to weaken the pawns still further.} 18. a4 Rc6 {Signalling the not very subtle plan of bringing all possible firepower to bear on c3.} 19. Rxf6 {....and then comes this bolt from the blue. Initially I regarded it as a mistake - surely white didn't have enough pieces on the kingside to exploit it?} gxf6 20. Qxf6 Rac8 {Back to business as normal, ignoring the impending check.} 21. Qg5+ Kf8 22. Ne4 {This was the point. Here I realized I had a problem, in fact I thought i might be already lost. I spent a long time analyzing the defensive plan seen in the next few moves.} Qd8 {Obviously white does not want to exchange queens. I figured Nf6 was likely, and would be met by ...e5.} 23. Nf6 e5 {As planned.} 24. Nxh7+ {White now has a passed h-pawn, but a potentially isolated knight for my rooks to chase.} Ke8 25. Qxe5+ Re6 26. Qf4 {White seems to run out of attacking possibilities after Qh8  Ke2.} Qb6 {Breaking out of defence with an attack on e3. } 27. Qd4 {White is now a pawn to the good after his sacrifice, and perhaps fancies his chances in the endgame; though I could not see any other good move for him in any case.} Qxd4 {Finally allowing white to straighten his pawns in return for play against his problem knight.} 28. exd4 Rg6 {This move cuts off Ng5, and h4 will be met by f6 or Rh6.} 29. c4 {Urgent counterplay.} dxc4 30. bxc4 {White creates a mobile passed pawn front to compensate for the impending loss of the knight. } Ke7 31. Re1+ Kd7 {White wants his rook on the f-file; he cannot put it there and keep my king off the e-file at the same time.} 32. h4 f6 33. Rf1 Ke7 {cf. earlier comments} 34. Rb1 Rc7 35. Rb8 Rg7 36. Nxf6 {Nf8 Rg8, Nd7!? saves the knight for the time being, but after ...Rxb8, Nxb8 it is confined passively in the other corner. White prefers an ending with four passed pawns against rook.} Kxf6 37. c5 Rg4 {I urgently have to pick off a few of white's extra pawns before the c and d-pawns become too dangerous. The d pawn is immobilized for the moment by the need to protect c5.} 38. Rd8 Rxh4 {One down...} 39. g3 Rhh7 {Intending to cut off the white rook, though it was too late for that.} 40. Rd6+ Ke7 41. Ra6 Rh5 {Heading for d5.} 42. Rg6 Rd5 43. Rg4 Kf6 {Aiming to lure the rook to f4 and then exchange it if the king moves to the f-file. } 44. Rf4+ Kg5 45. Kf2 Rf5 {As planned, though I can hardly say this sequence was forced.} 46. Ke3 Rxf4 47. gxf4+ Kf5 {I just about have time to pick up the f-pawn before racing back with the king.} 48. Kd3 {Otherwise I move the king over to d5 and white's pawn armada is over.} Kxf4 49. Kc4 Ke4 {The closing phase has to be played carefully. This move keeps the white king from d5 and virtually forces the pawn advance d5.} 50. d5 Ke5 51. d6 Rd7 {Now if c6, Rxd6 wins both pawns. 51...Rc6?? of course would have been met by 52.d7!} 52. Kb5 {White heads for a6, where he can build a stalemate cage by advancing the a-pawn.} Kd5 53. a5 {Now if ...Rb7 ?, Ka6 Kc6 (Kxc5 loses the rook), d7!  and black can only stop the pawn queening by leaving white in stalemate.} Rh7 {Removing the rook from the danger zone,  and white resigns. Now if Ka6 Kc6, d7 black takes with the king, e.g. ....Kxd7, Kxa7 Kc6 , Ka6 Rh5! (not Rh8?) and black wins.}
