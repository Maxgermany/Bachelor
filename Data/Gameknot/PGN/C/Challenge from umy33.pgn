1. e4 {e4 to start.} e5 {...met with e5.} 2. f4 {King's gambit offered.} exf4 {Gambit accepted!   game on!} 3. Nf3 {Nf3} g5 {g5 most popular.  I like Be7 personally.} 4. Bc4 {Gotta love that Bishop on c4.  Always a threat to sacrifice if White wants to really rip up Blacks Kingside defenses. } Bg7 {Taking charge of diagonal.} 5. O-O {Lining up the artillery on "f" file.} d6 {Weak Imo.  White Bishop remains a threat.} 6. d4 {Full court press.} h6 {Black continues with pawn assault.} 7. c3 {Bracing the center. } Ne7 {Preparing to castle.} 8. g3 {Attempting to draw off Black pawn on f4.} g4 {Black makes a play for the White Knight.} 9. Nh4 {White Knight runs for cover.} f3 {Black declines the pawn on g3 and pushes the attack deeper into White territory.} 10. Nxf3 {Knight sacrifices to blunt the advancing Black pawns, and also to open up attack lane f.} gxf3 {White Knight buys it.} 11. Bxf7+ {White deeply in debt, dives in even deeper with the Bishop sac.  Gotta love the KGA!} Kxf7 {White down by 5 pts, but Black King is now exposed on "f" file.} 12. Qxf3+ {Counter attack now on!} Kg8 {Black blunders here, not wanting to surrender his Knight by playing Nf5.} 13. Qf7+ {Black King on the run now!} Kh7 {King forced to the wall.  Black Bishop now pinned.} 14. Rf6 {This makes mate possible if Black misses the potential  Rxh6.} Nf5 {Black blocks potential mate.  } 15. Qg6+ {White still deeply in debt opts for a forced draw, seeing he cannot force a mate, and seeing his opponent has a 300 pt. ratings edge.  Lots of excitement in this game.  KGA can be a willy nilly slugfest where almost anything can happen if the slightest error is made.  Gotta LOVE KGA!}
