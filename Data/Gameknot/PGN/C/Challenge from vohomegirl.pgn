1. g4 {One of my favorite openings, because it throws the other player on their own resources.} d5 2. Bg2 Bxg4 {So far, sticking to what little "book" there is.} 3. c4 c6 4. cxd5 Nf6 {This move makes my position a little safer, as with the Knight on Black's KB3, it eliminates the possiblity of ...Q-R5 ch in the future.} 5. Nc3 cxd5 6. Qb3 Nc6 7. Nxd5 Qd7 {We're now out of the books. I'm now going to look for a chance to seize the center with my as-yet-held-back center Pawns.} 8. Nxf6+ exf6 9. d3 {Now my QB is free to develop.} Bb4+ 10. Bd2 Bxd2+ 11. Kxd2 {With the position already looking like an endgame, my King should be perfectly safe in the center. Now I just need to develop my KN and place my Rooks.} Be6 12. Qa3 a5 13. Nh3 {Black still needs to castle, but it appears an even middle game has been reached.} Nb4 14. Rhc1 {I would have preferred to play QR-QB1, but Black is assaulting my QRP at the moment.} O-O 15. Nf4 {If I can exchange my Knight for my opponent's Bishop, I'll have an endgame advantage. With the Pawn position fluid, the long-range B is superior.} b6 {Oops! Black forgot about my B hiding at KN2.} 16. Bxa8 Rxa8 {Now I have a significant material advantage. Strategy is trade down and avoid complications. if I can get the Queens off the board, my life would be good.} 17. Nxe6 fxe6 {Getting an exchange of minor pieces in is a good start.} 18. Qc3 {I double on the file.} Rc8 {Another blunder. Black didn't count the number of attacking pieces. I can now win a Rook.} 19. Qxc8+ Qxc8 20. Rxc8+ {The rest should be easy.} Kf7 21. a3 Nd5 22. Rac1 Kg6 23. Rb8 Kh5 24. Rc6 {I plan to trade a Rook for a Knight and Pawn, removing Black's last piece and setting up a flank majority that should soon generate a new Queen.} e5 25. Rcxb6 Nxb6 26. Rxb6 {Done.} Kg4 27. b4 h5 28. bxa5 {And Black resigns, as the Pawn cannot be stopped.}
