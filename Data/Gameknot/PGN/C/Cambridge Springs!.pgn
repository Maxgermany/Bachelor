1. Nf3 {A non-committal first move from white.} Nf6 {This is my preferred response to Nf3, as, since my opponent has the extra tempo as white, I'm content to let him carry the action, rather than forcing it myself with something like 1...d5.} 2. c4 {Is it the English opening?} e6 3. Nc3 d5 {Alright, so now I have enough support on d5 to play this, and I stake my claim to the center.} 4. d4 {Transposing into the Queen's Gambit Declined.  At this point, I steer things into the standard Cambridge Springs variation (4. ...c6 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3 Qa5!?)} c6 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3 Qa5 {So we've all heard about the dangers of bringing your queen out early, but the Cambridge Springs actually favors this.  A little bit on why; black gets a lot of tactical activity.  Yes, his exposed queen is a target, but he threatens to win material with tricks like Bb4 followed by Bxc3, if white moves the Nf3, then dxc4 discovers an attack on the Bg5, and black will have plenty of play on the queenside.  White has many options as well, and my opponent eschews the main line (7. Nfd2 Bb4 8. Qc2) for reasons all his own.} 7. Bxf6 {Prevents the tactic of dxc4, but this surrenders the bishop pair and helps me to untangle, as well as solving the problem of my Nd7 for me.} Nxf6 8. Bd3 {After Bd3, I seriously considered playing 8. ...dxc4 just for spite, so that he feels he's wasted a tempo.  But there's a better move first...} Bb4 {Forcing white to address the threat by playing either Qc2 or Qb3 (Rc1 fails to Bxc3 , which wins the a2 pawn for black).} 9. Qc2 {The best choice, creating a battery with the light-squared bishop.} dxc4 {;-)  Of course.} 10. Bxc4 O-O {With a strong queenside presence it makes sense to castle kingside.} 11. O-O {Likewise for white.} Bd6 {I wasn't in a hurry to press things here -- I know I don't have much of an advantage (if any), and so I want to let things play out.    Right now, I think it's prudent to shift my attentions to the center, where white has amassed a large force.} 12. e4 {And he knows it -- he's playing for a big center now.} e5 {So I'll fight him for it.  This move has the added bonus of freeing the Bc8.} 13. Rfe1 {Centralizes the rook, but I'm not so sure about how good this move is, as there isn't anything even potentially happening on the e-file; the e4 pawn is already defended twice.} Bg4 {That knight is really helping white control the center, and I'm thinking about giving him doubled pawns and opening the area around his king.    I'll trade a bishop pair advantage for exposing his king with all my heavy pieces on the board in a heartbeat here!} 14. d5 {...and he lets me.  This is actually a poor move, I think, as this walks into black's defense, which is by no means weak!} Bxf3 {Told you I was going to do this.} 15. gxf3 {And now his kingside pawn structure is severely damaged.} Rac8 {And this discourages dxc6.  Black's going to have some play on the c-file; he can open it at will.} 16. Qd3 {Understandably not wanting to get crunched when it happens.} Rfd8 {Of course, I could crunch him on the d-file, too.} 17. Qe2 {And this could easily have been played last move.  It occured to me here that white doesn't have a plan -- and so if I can come up with one, I'm going to be in far better shape than white is!} Bb4 {So I decided now was the time to go after the knight again, that its protection was weak.} 18. dxc6 {Resolving the central tension in black's favor.  I was happy to see this move!} Rxc6 {Let's take stock now.  I've got control of the c- and d-files, his king's cover is suspect, and his pieces are pretty weakly positioned.  White's first order of business is to address the threat to his Nc3.} 19. Rec1 {Again, not a bad move, but it makes white's 13th look silly.  I know I moved Bb4, then Bd6, and then Bb4 again, but considering the space and control I have, it's not a big deal.  The next moves come easily for black, as his control of space allows him to attack at will.} Rd4 {Threatening to win the bishop.  When the bishop moves, the Nc3 comes under fire.  I thought relatively best for white was the somewhat aggressive Bd5.} 20. Bb3 {But this allows me to win a pawn, and more importantly, to restrict white's position even further.  (Maybe Karpov would be proud!)} Bxc3 21. bxc3 Rxc3 {And white has threats, no doubt, and black must be careful (look how weak his back rank is), but at this point I think I'm winning.} 22. Qe1 {Looks like it pins the Rc3, but I've got nothing to be afraid of.  He can't threaten to win anything, as Rxc1 prevents Qxa5.} Rdd3 {Loading up on the 3rd rank.  I know, all the books tell you to do it on the 2nd, but this just works better here.  Black threatens Rxf3 now, further exposing white's king, and granting his rooks even greater scope.} 23. Rcd1 {I don't know how this white rook can maneuver more, but it isn't effective.  The d8 square is covered by the queen!} Rdxf3 {So I'm happy to play Rxf3.} 24. Rac1 {Exchanges now will only bring me closer to a won endgame.  So, I decide, it's time to prevent a back-rank mate.} g6 {Nice & simple.} 25. Qd2 {?  White must be trying for something like 26. Qh3 followed by 27. Rxc3 Qxc3?? 28. Rd8#, but this move allows the very powerful...} Nxe4 {Ouch!  The white queen must flee, and only has a few squares that don't result in her immediate death.} 26. Qh6 {??  Overlooking one of the consequences of Nxe4...} Rfh3 {Rh3! traps the queen.  At this point white resigned (and resignation is not premature), but this was a fun game for me, as well as a model cambridge springs game, where everything worked!  So the moral is, understand what the position is telling you, don't waste moves, and always HAVE A PLAN.  Umm... those are obvious morals.  Never mind.  Hope it was fun!}
