1. Nf3 {Playing for the King's Indian Attack} d5 2. g3 e6 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. O-O Nc6 5. d3 Bd6 6. Nbd2 O-O 7. Re1 Bd7 8. e4 {Theoretical position, the game is pretty even at this point.} dxe4 9. Nxe4 Be7 {9..Nxe4 is also solid response} 10. Bf4 {Development move to bring out the bishop to play but not good due to 10..Nd5 is best response here for black to kick bishop to 11.Bd2 and now Black Knight has more aggressive position now on d5 square.} Qc8 {Not sure about this move, it doesn't contribute anything in this position for black. Now white has a slight edge in the current position.} 11. Qd2 {Connecting rooks and developing queen is pretty good, but again Nd5 is pretty strong in this position too for now my bishop can't retreat on D2 square.} e5 {Bad Mistake by Black giving me free pawn with no compensation for black to get it back.} 12. Nxe5 Nxe5 13. Bxe5 Bh3 {So now the Qc8 had a purpose in the position but is it really worth a pawn to exchange white colored bishop for a healthy attack on the king now. } 14. Qg5 h6 {h6 is the best and only good response. If we go 14..Bxg2, 15.Nxf6,Bxf6 16.Bxf6 and now black loses a whole piece and white threatens mate he can delay it one move with 16..g6 but then 17.Qh6 wins next move with Qg7.  Next move to look at is 14..Qg4 15.Nxf6,Bxf6 16.Bxf6,Qxg5 17.Bxg5,Bxg2 18.Kxg2,Rfe8 White is up Bishop and pawn in the position not as tactical as a little while ago but the endgame is very simple you want to move bishop to d2 exchange a rook then rook e1 if you then exchange the other pair of rooks if he denies capture then Re7 is coming and white will have a overwhelming position but he captures then its 6 pawns vs 7 pawns and Bishop I don't mind playing that any day of the week. On to the next move 14..Kh8 this move make sense to get out of the pin of his pieces 15.Bxf6 (if Nxf6 then black has a annoying pin to my queen),Bxf6 16.Nxf6,Bxg2 is also a option here then 17.Kxg2 the position gives white a very strong because of powerful knight full control E E E-file with Re7 and Rae1 soon to follow(if black captures knight on f6 it leads to overwhelming attack after moves Qf6 check then Re5 is coming)(h6 is also possible here but it helps white get out of the pin) now 14..h6  15.Qh4,Nxe4! 16.Qxh3(16.Qxe4,Bxg2 17.Kxg2,Rfe8 possible line but gives black more chances to hold the position),Qxh3 17.Bxh3,Ng5 18.Bg2,c6 leading to a position where white is only up by one pawn rather than a whole piece.} 15. Qh4 Bxg2 16. Kxg2 c6 {Very bad move because it doesn't contribute at all to the current problem in this position for black is under attack and it is a scary one indeed.} 17. Bxf6 Bxf6 18. Nxf6+ gxf6 19. Qxh6 {both Queen captures get the job done in the end but I prefer 19.Qh6 capture due to no moves the king can make at the moment.} Qf5 20. Re4 {Adding another attacker to the one Queen that is defending for him. The idea of an attack is you need more pieces attacking than defending  giving you the phrase "overloading the their pieces" making it more difficult for him to protect until the inevitable end in which the position collapses.} Qg5 21. Qh3 {21.Qxg5 is also good but keeping the material on the board can lead to a much hard time for him to defend and easier time for me to attack.} Qg7 {Final mistake in this position leading to his Resignation.} 22. Rg4 {Nail in the coffin. It is more of that he is psychological defeated and the psychical position is unpleasant for him to deal with.}
