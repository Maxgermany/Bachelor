1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 e6 {Blocking the bishop's diagonal and limiting its usefulness.} 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d3 Nf6 5. Bg5 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. h4 {This is probably too aggressive.  White has no guarantee of a winning attack on the flank while my center potential is threatening.} h6 {Forcing a decision.} 8. Be3 {A mistake, allowing me to force the loss of a piece.} d5 {The classic central break, now enhanced because of the positions of his bishops and c3 knight.} 9. e5 {Not very useful.  I will simply move away.} Ng4 10. Bxd5 exd5 11. d4 f6 {If he take the f6 pawn, I intend to take with the bishop, enticing him to take on c5.  If he takes, I will triple his pawns with Bxc3.} 12. exf6 Bxf6 13. dxc5 Bxc3+ 14. bxc3 {White's pawn structure is ruined, and he's down in material.  It SHOULD be a sinch to win this, but, being a teenager, I do something dumb and impulsive that allows Mr. Clark to get back into the game.} Nxe3 15. fxe3 Bg4 16. Kf2 Ne5 17. Qd4 Nxf3 18. gxf3 Rxf3+ {Bxf3 was probably better.} 19. Kg2 Kh8 {Totally missing his next move.} 20. Qxg4 Qf6 {Now I'm losing in material, but white has tripled pawns. } 21. Rhf1 {White could have taken on f3 without fear.  Both me and my opponent are performing sub-par.} Rxf1 22. Rxf1 Qxc3 23. Rf7 {White has a "pig on the seventh".  He has better chances, despite his tripled pawns.} Qxc2+ 24. Kh3 Qc3 {Keeping a wary eye on the possible mate on g7.} 25. Qd4 Qxd4 26. exd4 b6 {Risky, but I like 26...Rb8 27.c6 even less.} 27. c6 Rc8 28. c7 Kg8 29. Rd7 {Threatening Rd8+, when white gets a queen.  My next move is forced.} Kh7 {Now I have to get my king around the pawns before his king blocks the way.} 30. Kg4 Kg6 {Just in time!} 31. h5+ Kf6 32. Kf4 a5 33. Ke3 {Spotting the distant queenside pawnstorm and attempting to preempt it.} g5 {Forcing him to take.  This position is beginning to look drawish.} 34. hxg6 e.p. Kxg6 35. Rd6+ Kg7 36. Rd7+ Kf6 37. Rd6+ Kg7 {Draw agreed.}
