1. Nf3 {Interesting opening} d5 {I take advantage of the center} 2. c4 {? he sacrifices his pawn} dxc4 3. g3 {plans to fianchetto his bishop} Nc6 {developing} 4. Bg2 {developing} Nf6 {continuing to develop} 5. O-O {castling early} e5 {opening up by bishops diagonals } 6. Nc3 {he develops} Bb4 {I develop} 7. a3 Bxc3 {I trade} 8. bxc3 O-O {castle kingside still with a pawn lead} 9. Qa4 {he attacks my pawn} b5 {?? I have no clue why I played this I was always planning to play Be6. I think I thought the pawn was defended and I could get his queen away} 10. Qxb5 {He takes of course and due to my blunder were tied, if anything hes in the lead due to my double pawns and an isolated one} Qd5 {defend the pawn and offer a trade} 11. Qxd5 Nxd5 {puts my knight in a more dangerous position} 12. Ng5 {discovered attack on my knight} Nde7 {defending both knights} 13. Be4 {attacking h7} f5 {getting his bishop away } 14. Bg2 {he continues to attack my knight. I cannot move either knight because I will be down a rook or knight. He is probably winning because he has full mobility to his pieces.} h6 {getting his pieces away} 15. Nh3 g5 {threatening to win his knight} 16. d3 {?? loses a knight this is probably where he loses the game but he still has a chance with his bishop in a great position} cxd3 {I take no need to lose a pawn I can always play g4} 17. exd3 g4 {winning a knight and taking my first advantage since the opening} 18. Ng5 {I probably would have played Kf4 because then he'll also win the c7 pawn} hxg5 {I take} 19. Bxg5 {he takes} Rb8 {Best move by far. If I don't play this then Bxe7 Nxf7 Bxa8. If I dont play this I at least lose a knight and probably more.} 20. Rab1 {offers a trade} Rxb1 {Why not?} 21. Rxb1 Kh7 {trying to chase his bishop away} 22. h3 gxh3 {trading down for an endgame} 23. Bxh3 {Yes I can finally move my knight but not yet because e7 would be unprotected} Nd5 {so I decide to move it threatening c3} 24. Bd2 {he defends it} f4 {I offer a trade} 25. g4 Rg8 {he doesn't accept} 26. Rb5 {he threatens my knight} Nf6 {so I move away threatening his pawn} 27. Rc5 {I thought I had lost a pawn but } Bd7 {I can defend the knight} 28. c4 {interesting} e4 {! I trade pawns. If he takes e4 then ai take with Kxe4 forking his rook and bishop. So he must play Bxd4.} 29. Bxf4 exd3 {I trade pawns. It looks like I actually lost two pawns but if Bxc7 then d2 and he cant stop me from queening.} 30. Bg2 {Here I thought I was done because he would take my knight or at least win the pawn but...} Rxg4 {! Bam pinning his bishop and he resigns. Thank you for watching please comment any of my mistakes or any observations.}
