[Round "1"]
[White "choknowsall (1234)"]
[Black "hercules_isadore (1246)"]
[Opening "King's pawn game (C44)"]

1. e4 e5 {Pawn to pawn. This is how men begin a fight!} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Second game starts exactly like the first. This probably would have turned into an...Italian opening? I think somebody called it that. Just like the Ruey Lopez save white's move three only goes as far as Bc4.}
