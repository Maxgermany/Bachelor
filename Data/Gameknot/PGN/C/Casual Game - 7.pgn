1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 {The King's Gambit, and Miller is an honorable person: it must be accepted!} 3. Bc4 {In some variations of the Bishop's Gambit, White is prepared to move his King to KB1.

This move exposes Black to a potential Q-R5.} 4. exf5 {White gratefully recaptures his gambited material.} b6 {Preparing to fianchetto the B. But in open games, such slow development often proves fatal.} 5. Qh5+ {The lightning-bolt strikes.} Ke7 {Miller sees that P-N3 is futile, but this move isn't any better.} 6. Qf7+ {The King-hunt is on in earnest.} Kd6 7. Nc3 Ba6 {Taking advantage of the momentary lull to attack the B. But the lull was just the calm in the eye of the hurricane.} 8. Ne4+ {Closing in.} Kc6 9. Qd5# {Finishing with a flourish.}
