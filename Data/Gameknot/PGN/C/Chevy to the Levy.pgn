[Opening "QGD (D08), Albin counter-gambit"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 {I wanted to play aggressively, so I try to introduce imbalances early, here on the second move.  White is prepared to play e3 if d/c.} e5 {An extremely vigorous reply.  This looks like a gambit of some kind, and I would be really interested to know the name of this opening.} 3. e3 {I am not sure if this is the correct move and would like to know.} dxc4 {I may be wrong, but ..e/d looked better to me.} 4. d5 {D5 really ups the ante, now that white is gambiting a pawn.  I just wanted to keep the position as fluid and complicated as possible.  Sometimes, as here, I play a move that looks intuitively good to me, without a lot of calculation.  I am pretty sure black can undermine and win the d pawn, but on the other hand the pawn, while it remains, is pretty annoying from black's perspective.  An early advanced pawn can be distracting and could hinder black's development.} Bb4+ 5. Nc3 Bxc3+ {So black is immediately giving up his dark-squared bishop.  I wonder about this move, though.  It is going to be an open board, and maybe white will play e4 followed by be3.} 6. bxc3 b5 7. e4 {He elects to defend c4, and I am able to defend d5.} Nf6 8. f3 {It looks like be3 would also be good here.} O-O 9. Be3 {White does have a potential problem here, since he is still at least three moves from castling.} h6 10. Ne2 {Preparing to play Ng3 and be2.} Qe7 {I don't think this move makes it as unpleasant for white as nd7 and f5 would be.  I think the only idea is to threaten c3 after qa3.} 11. Ng3 {Inviting qa3, if that was the intent, and vacating e2 for the bishop.} b4 {This move is certainly distracting and causes me to take time away from solving my castling problem, but I don't think it guarantees any major advantages.} 12. Qc2 Na6 {Again, I am not sure about black's play here.  Let me know what you think.  I guess the idea is to threaten nc5 or nb4, but after nb4 the knight is still going to be defended by the queen alone, and maybe it will be a liability.} 13. Bxc4 Bd7 {Black blundered terribly here and just lost a piece.  It was a blitz game, after all.} 14. Bxa6 bxc3 15. O-O {I think this is better than qc3, but let me know what you think about this position.} c6 16. Nf5 {I think this move may not have been that great.  Maybe I should do something about the loose bishop on a6.} Bxf5 {I think that is the best continuation for black.} 17. exf5 Nxd5 {I think black is playing very solidly here.  He is only a pawn down here.} 18. Bf2 {I think the idea here was to keep the bishop for bg3.} Rad8 {During the game, this move didn't seem that critical to me.  But let me know what you think about it.  } 19. Rfe1 {With ideas of f4.} g5 {This moves looks to be another blunder.} 20. fxg6 e.p. {Would you call f/g6 en passant a crushing move, or do you think black can defend this position.} f5 {! I think this is a fairly creative move, since it would at first seem that the white queen is coming in with decisive effect.} 21. Bc4 {Just pinning that knight, and qc3 is on.} Qb4 {I wonder if black has made another mistake in this critical position.  I feel that if I can weather the tactical threats black is subjecting me to, the g6 pawn will tell.} 22. Bxd5+ Rxd5 {I admit that taking may not have been the best continuation for white, although I am up material here.} 23. Rab1 Qc4 24. Rb7 {Would you call this rb7 crushing?  Maybe I could have followed up with an immediate rh7 and been much better.} e4 {Aggressive play from black.  E3 is obviously not playable at the moment, and is e/f really that strong for black?} 25. Be3 {And here I played the nice move be3.  The threat is simply bh6, after which rh7 will be absolutely killing.} exf3 {Bh6 seemed a possible move here, but maybe I am wrong.  The move that will bring me closer to victory will also take me nearer defeat, as f2+ would appear to win the white queen.} 26. gxf3 {Here I again assessed the position as favorable for white.  Clearly, it is imperative for white to keep control of g4.} f4 {Besides threatening to win the bishop, I think this is a good move because of the threat of rff5. But here I find a truly beautiful idea.  I find a queen sacrifice after g7.} 27. g7 Rg5+ {But I can't play qh7+.  Will I get a chance?} 28. Kf2 {Probably not, after this mistake.} fxe3+ 29. Rxe3 Qh4+ {Black only has this check, and white would still have qh7+, but my king is getting really uncomfortable.} 30. Kf1 Qh3+ 31. Ke1 Rg1+ {And this move is really crushing, since I am losing my queen now.} 32. Ke2 Rg2+ {And it's all over.}
