1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Be3 {A move that is bad for three reasons. It blocks the e-pawn. This in turn prevents the f-bishop from developing normally. And it does nothing (protects a pawn that does not need protection).} Bf5 4. Nf3 e6 5. g3 {At least the bishop will try a fianchetto.} Bb4 6. a3 Ba5 7. Bf4 {Finally this bishop is at a better square, but maybe g5 was better.} Ne4 8. a4 {Useless. Now black will win a pawn.} Nxc3 {BxN was also possible.} 9. Qd2 Nxe2 10. Qxa5 Nxf4 11. gxf4 O-O {Bxc2 was possible, since after Rc1 black can play b6. But black plays it safe.} 12. c4 {This could have been a good idea, were it not for white's reply.} Be4 13. Bg2 b6 14. Qd2 {Why not c3?} dxc4 {Another pawn is netted.} 15. Qe3 Bd5 16. O-O Nd7 17. Ne5 Nf6 {With an idea that is interesting...} 18. Rac1 Bxg2 19. Kxg2 Qd5+ 20. f3 Rac8 21. Rxc4 Ng4 {This is the move black had in mind, but it is unsound.} 22. Qe2 {Not so bad, but Qc3 was better to put pressure on the weak c7 pawn.} Nxe5 {Maybe black would have been better off swallowing his pride and put the knight back on f6.} 23. fxe5 {Now white is back on track. The c column is all his. But black has the d column with a passed pawn.} Rfd8 24. Rg1 {It is tempting to use the open column to attack the black king, but I beleive here the right strategy was to go for the c7 pawn. So R(f)-c1 was called for. The attack on the g file is not as dangerous as it seems.} Qd7 {The queen must yield the front position to the rook (and possibly come to the rescue of the king).} 25. Kf1 {Kh1 was much to be preferred, putting the king to safety, and still allowing for the g rook to go to c1.} c5 {Now black can play this freeing move which also becomes an attacking move.} 26. Qg2 g6 27. f4 {Even though this move does not help the attack, it is already difficult to find a saving move for white, since opening the center is suicidal for white. But it will be opened anyway.} cxd4 28. Rb4 {Rc2 (or RxR) was an absolute necessity.} Rc1+ 29. Kf2 Rc2+ 30. Kf3 Rxg2 31. Rxg2 d3 32. h4 {}
