1. e4 {By agreement, we will play the Evans Gambit, which is a favorite of both players with White.   White is a Master Candidate over the board, but is new on gameknot, his true elo is far above the gameknot indication.  He is a formidable opponent.   Black is a coach. } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {White moves to play the Evans Gambit.  Black prefers and normally plays the Two Knights (3. ... Nf6), but will play into the Evans for this game, to evaluate Whites' true strength.} Bc5 {The Giuoco Piano.  First step to the Evans.} 4. b4 {The Evans Gambit.  I recommend it to beginning players because it is an attacking, tactical game.  White will yield a wing pawn for tempo and space. } Bxb4 {Black accepts the gambit.} 5. c3 {White will gain space and tempo with the dislodgement of the black bishop.} Ba5 {The bishop must come to a5, white gains a tempo on Bc5. } 6. d4 {The book move.  So far, every thing has been main line book.} exd4 {Capablanca said: "Capture with the kings pawn at every opportunity.",  Black complies.} 7. Qb3 {This was a surprise to Black, who expected 0-0.  White is obviously a gambler who enjoys the attack.   Mohammad shared that this move has been played by Short and Conquest in a few games.  He shared what he believes is the Main Line with me:  7. 0-0  Nge7, 8. cxd4 d5, 9. exd5 Nxd5, 10. Qb3.  I did not know this line.   So, now Black is out of the opening and into the middle game!  I suspect White has had experience in this line and will still be in the opening for a while.  While White remains in the opening, Black now enters his middle game:   Blacks' plan now is: a.  Seize the initiative at the first opportunity.   Gain time whenever possible. b.  Hold any material advantage so far gained until the initiative is gained. c.  Get the pieces into play, with attacking moves where possible.   It appears that White's plan is mainly tactical:  Attack f7, build a center, get the Kings rook into play on the e-file.  In the Evans, White wins lots of brilliancy prizes - unless it goes to an endgame.   White must attack relentlessly, seeking tactical opportunities.  } Qe7 {The only reasonable move.  Black holds f7 and attacks e4.} 8. O-O {The pawn on e4 is safe because of the pin that would occur on the e-file.  The rook will now seize the e-file.   } Nf6 {Black does not take the c3 pawn because White would gain another tempo, bringing his knight into play at no cost.  Black must gain tempo in order to seize the initiative, not lose tempo.  d6, Bb6, and h6 are all playable here; but they are too defensive for this Black player, who wants the initiative - and Nf6 offers better opportunities to grasp the initiative.  } 9. Re1 {The rook reaches his post.} Ng4 {The knight is headed for e5, to blockade the e4 pawn, and to threaten the bishop on c4.  } 10. e5 {White knows the importance of opening the e-file and cannot have the pawn blockaded.} Ngxe5 {If Black is to ever seize the initiative, he cannot make defensive moves that do not accomplish a second objective.  This self-pin of the knight will result in loss of the piece - for a price.  The knight captures a second pawn, 'attacks' the bishop, threatens Nxf6  with discovery on the e1 rook and also protects f7 from this post!  The initiative is in the balance!} 11. Nxe5 {White must exchange the best defender of the kingside in order to win the piece. } Nxe5 {This knight can eventually be captured by the d-pawn or f-pawn.  Once White gets the e1 rook off e1 the pin on c3 is broken and the discovery on f3 loses its potency.  This capture is the the way to avoid the discovered attack by 12. Nf3.  Having said all of that, I really don't like White's position.  The pinned pawn on c3 is taking away the best square for his knight, the white knight cannot go to d2 to protect f3 because it must guard that pinned pawn.  To unpin the pawn, the rook must leave e1, and only e2 seems a reasonable placement because it must hold the pin on the knight.  The e1 rook is hanging and the discovered attack by ... Nf6  will win the rook if it remains on e1 unprotected.  Once the pinning bishop is relocated to b6 it will attack White's kingside and the thing that troubles me most about White's position is that the kings knight is missing from the defense.  Again, the queens knight cannot get there because it is tied down to the defense of the c3 pawn.  That means that White needs to find the tempi to get the c1 bishop into the game without blocking d2 as the knights' next post.  As White, I would not like the situation where the queenside pieces have not been developed and Black just needs a target for his c1 bishop in order to gain tempo.  As White, I would like to get the c1 bishop into play on this move, but I think that Re2 is probably best, in order to break the pin without leaving the rook hanging.  Still, this is the first time I have seen this position and deeper study may prove my thinking inaccurate.   } 12. Re4 {I think this move makes Blacks' development easier and then opens the black diagonal to whites' king after cxd4.  It may have been better to take the king off of the a7-g8 diagonal.  White missed this and lost a tempo and eventually the initiative.   } d6 {'protecting' the knight, but more importantly developing the bishop. } 13. cxd4 {The d-pawn will eat the knight.  This break gives the white knight a good square on c3, which would unhang the rook on e4.  When the d4 pawn captures the knight  the bishop relocates to b6 and it will bear down on the king through a pinned pawn on f2.   However, the White pawns are disappearing from the queenside.} Bf5 {The bishop develops with an attack.  Even though the white rook is currently hanging, there is no discovered attack by the black knight because the rook is protected after Nf6  and gxf3.  From this point forward, however, Black has the initiative!   White is currently focused on getting the knight he is owed.  Meanwhile, White has not yet developed his queenside pieces. } 14. Re2 {Where else?  On e3 the d4 pawn would be pinned again.  Maybe the rook should have gone here to begin with.  } Bg4 {Inducing f3, which opens the diagonal to the white king!} 15. f3 {Now the d-pawn can be pinned again!   Further planning is required by Black: a.  If all of the pieces were now removed from the board, Black would have an overwhelming queenside pawn structure.  This means that he must look toward an eventual pawn assault on the queenside.   b.  In order to reach the endgame envisioned, Black will need to exchange pieces.   c.  If the endgame envisioned is reached, Black will need his king on the queenside in order to support the pawns.  He will therefore delay or defer castling on the kingside.   Therefore, Black plans to continue to work to seize the initiative, to get his king to the queenside when the intent is concealed or it is necessary, and to trade down the pieces to get to the pawn ending.} Bb6 {Pinning the pawn, and threatening Bxd4 , winning the rook.  This is an important zwischenzug as it beckons the black bishop to b2 in defense of the pawn.  } 16. Bb2 {Sure enough, the bishop comes to b2.  This may not be the best square for the bishop, but this is probably the best move in this position.   } Be6 {With the lost knight about to be removed from the board, Black plays to close the e-file and to shut down the attack on d7.} 17. Bxe6 {Perhaps Black will play fxe6, causing doubled pawns after dxe5 dxe5.} Qxe6 {Black retakes with the queen to offer a queen exchange.   Every exchange favors Black because of the queenside pawns. } 18. Kf1 {White's rook was hanging, this king move protects the rook and brings the king toward the center of the board, which puts him closer to the queenside.} Qh6 {Black attacks! With the White Kings Bishop off the board, the White attack is muted.   } 19. dxe5 {White attacks!  Threatening a deadly discovered check as well as Qxf7.} O-O-O {The Black King gets to the queenside by force!  Perhaps White does not realize Black's plan yet.   The pawn attack on the queenside is taking shape.  The b6 bishop has become dangerous, it encroaches on the White kings' mobility, and that may take White's attention.} 20. h3 {This purely defensive move does keep the queen out for a while, but it weakens the black squares on the kingside and Black has a bishop that uses those squares.  The black holes created can be used by the queen, as well as the bishop. } Qf4 {Threatening to penetrate by Qh2.} 21. e6 {White Threatens both exf7 and e7.} Rhe8 {A chance to exchange another piece!  With every exchange Black approaches the desired endgame.} 22. exf7 Rxe2 {On with the plan!} 23. Kxe2 d5 {Cutting off the White Queens' diagonal, the f7 pawn is no longer protected.  This move also seizes c4 as an exchange post for the Black Queen.  The threat is now ... Qc4  and queen exchange.} 24. a4 {White had two good options, Qd3 and Nd2, and he missed them both.  The pawn will displace the bishop, as White wants to create weaknesses in Blacks' queenside.  It serves a secondary value in perhaps bringing the rook into play.  However, this process seems too slow.  Another consideration is that while Black has two connected passed pawns now, he could have as many as four connected passed pawns if anything happens to White's a-file pawn.   } Qxf7 {Removing the advanced pawn, protecting g7 and supporting d5, releasing the rook from this task.  } 25. Kf1 {The White King needs to get off of the open file.  He is headed to support the kingside pawns.   However, the King could have waited and moved when attacked since it may be wise to let Black guess whether the White king will go to the kingside or the queenside when attacked.   Rather than leave the king lonely on the kingside, White may be better off getting some help to that side of the board.  All of the white pieces are piled in the lower left hand corner of the board.  If the White Queen were on d3 it would be in a much better defensive position, with play on both sides of the board; but White still pursues a decreasingly effective attacking agenda.  } Qe7 {Seizing the open file, and looking at c5, h4, and e6.   Black is down a piece, but his pieces are much more effective than Whites' pieces.} 26. a5 {White has used three moves with this pawn in order to dislodge the bishop.  With the b7 pawn protected by the black King, the black bishop can safely move.  Black wants to stay on the same diagonal with his bishop, and his Qe7 move has made c5 safe for this bishop.} Re8 {Zwischenzug!  Now, Black threatens mate on e1.} 27. Qd1 {This move protects both e1 and e2.  However, White's best try may be Nc3 which may lead to: 27: ... Bd4, 28. a6  b6,  29. Qxd5  Qe3, 30. Qa8   Kd7, 31. Qd5  with perpetual check.    } Bc5 {The bishop will stay on this diagonal, in order to continue to hold g1 and f2; and here it will also deny a3 to the white rook.} 28. Ra4 {The rook is coming into play.  a3 is a better square for the rook, but is now denied.   Ba3 may have been a better move, because after the forced exchange the rook would be on a3.  } Qd7 {This queen move protects d5, threatens Qb5 , and holds the white queen to the protection of the white rook.} 29. Bd4 {Now that Black has the initiative, White wants to trade down to blunt the attack.  This suits Blacks' plan to remove pieces from the board.} Qb5+ {First, however: another zwischenzug!  The White king must move onto the diagonal which will give black check with the bishop capture in d4.  White will not be able to recapture on d4 with the queen because the knight would be hanging, so the rook must move to recapture.} 30. Kg1 Bxd4+ {Exchanging, as planned.} 31. Rxd4 {White must recapture with the rook.} Qxa5 {Black captures the pawn with tempo: Now, Re1  is threatened.  The dominant feature on the board is obviously the four connected passed pawns.} 32. Nd2 {The knight blocks the Black Queens' diagonal to e1.  Qd2 works out about the same way a few moves hence.} Qc3 {Black continues on the initiative by attacking the rook and threatening Qe6 .} 33. Qa4 {The White Queen attacks the black rook, accelerating the black rook to e1; but this is the only square from which the White Rook can be protected.} Re1+ {White is in trouble, but black must restrain his rook to continue control of e8, to prevent the White Queen from coming to that mating square.} 34. Kh2 c6 {With this move the White Queen is blocked from e8, the Black rook is free, and d5 is protected.  Now it should be apparent that the four connected black pawns on the queenside are the major force in this game.  } 35. Qxa7 {White reduces the enemy pawn force by one.  Still, he is trading time for this pawn.} Kc7 {The King continues to hold b7 while also holding b6.  The king will need to accompany the pawns up the board and this better positions him. } 36. Qa4 {The a7 pawn capture cost White two tempi, since the Black king wants to move up the board, anyway. } Ra1 {This forces the exchange of queens.  } 37. Qb4 Qxb4 38. Rxb4 {The pawns are looking more and more formidable.  Two connected passed pawns on the sixth rank are stronger than a rook, and a knight can only stop two connected passed pawns by occupying the square directly in front of the more backward when they are in echelon.  That is probably impossible when the White king is far afield, and the pawns are supported by the Black king.   } c5 {Here come the pawns!} 39. Rg4 {White now intends to capture the black kingside pawns, and try to distract Black and to queen a white kingside pawn.} Kc6 {The Black King stays with his pawns.} 40. Nb3 {The Knight moves to interfere with the pawns.  Perhaps not a good move.  The knight has no scope, where it is or where it was.  Better may be to advance f4, because after Rxg7 the white f-pawn will be passed.  } Ra3 {There is no place for the knight to move, except back to the square he just left.  He will 'sacrifice' himself for one pawn plus the disconnection of the remaining two black pawns.  } 41. Nxc5 {This move is forced.  Nd2 loses quickly with: 41. ...  c4, 42. f4  c3,  43. Nf3  g6, 44. Nd4   Kc5,  45. Ne6  Kb6, 46. Nd4  Ra2.} Kxc5 {We are now in an endgame.  Black's plan is obvious:  March the passed pawns up the board.  He must use his king, because the rook is ill suited to protect both disconnected pawns.   If White begins toward the queenside with his King, the Black rook will need to restrain him.  When White's rook attacks a passed black pawn, either King or rook must be in position to protect.  Black expects the game to be decided on the queenside, and will not use tempi to protect his kingside pawns. But what is White's plan?   He seems to have only one possibility for a draw:  to capture  one or more kingside pawns, getting a passed pawn on the kingside, and race for a White Queen.   However, Black has tempo; his queenside pawns are already passed and one is already on the fourth rank.   So, if White chooses this path, he must quickly produce a passed pawn.  Which one?  Obviously, the f-pawn, because it will become a passed pawn in just one move.  White cannot squander tempi, he must leave the h7 pawn rather than waste a move capturing.  Having more pawns than black will not win because the deciding factor will be tempo, not material.    White's hope must be that he can get his distant king in front of the advancing Black pawns.  It may not be possible, since it will require a 'juggling' act by his rook.  The rook must restrain the Black queenside pawns without helping Black get his King up the board!      } 42. Rxg7 {The White rook gets the black g-pawn.The f-pawn is now passed.  With White, I would try to queen the f-pawn, time is important: The rook can only hold the Black pawns for a short time and the king is far from the action.    } b5 {The Black pawns keep rolling up the board.} 43. Rxh7 {This may be a costly loss of tempo.  White should ignore this pawn and play f4 while the Black rook is no threat.  Time is important.} b4 {Another step forward.} 44. h4 {White cannot stop the Black pawns, he hopes to slow them down and threaten to queen his own pawn.  } b3 {Closer to the queening square.} 45. h5 {Had White left and not captured the Black h-pawn, his f-pawn would now be on f6!} d4 {And, here goes the second Black pawn.  This is intended to present the White rook with a dilemma.  He will have two pawns to restrain.} 46. Rc7+ {This check clears the h-file for the White pawn.  No clearance would be necessary on the f-file.  This move appears 'free', but it helps Black by driving the Black king up the board, where it wants to go.} Kb4 {Every step the black king takes up the board is a small victory for Black.  Unfortunately for White, the rook must attack from the rear.  } 47. Rb7+ {Again, perhaps not the best move.  Moving h6 with the intent of checking when the b-pawn reached the queening square may work better.  Black must take two moves to get a pawn up the board safely, White only needs one move except when his pawn reaches the seventh rank, at which time he must move his rook to the eighth rank and it will cost a move.  } Kc3 {The King continues on his escort trip.} 48. Rc7+ {Again, the King is getting a free ride up the board.} Kd2 {The king does not block either pawn, he declines to move to a self-blocking position at either b2 or d3.  He wants to be in a position to interpose the Black rook between White rook and king, once he moves b2.  } 49. Rb7 {Restraining the b-pawn, temporarily.} d3 {Again, here comes the second pawn.  The horns of the dilemma are now clear.  The rook, alone, is insufficient to stop the pawns.} 50. h6 Kc2 {Now, Black can play b7 or d7; White's next move is forced.} 51. Rc7+ Kd1 {Now, after d2, Black can intercept the White rook with his own rook if White is not careful, and he can bring both pawns to the 7th rank, with the help of his king.   The Black rook can move to a8 to prevent the White pawn from queening, but may become overloaded; Black must rely on his king and not overload the rook.  White should be considering giving his rook for an advanced pawn and entering a new game with Queen and pawns against Queen and rook.     } 52. Rb7 d2 {The first black pawn reaches the seventh rank.} 53. h7 {The white pawn reaches 7th rank.  The difference is the protection of the Black king and the absence of the White king.  White's rook is overloaded.  It cannot restrain the Black pawns and protect the White pawn simultaneously.  The White king is a non-player.} Ra8 {As planned.  The Black rook prevents the White pawn from Queening.  } 54. Rxb3 {White decides to 'sacrifice' his rook for a queen.  Rg7 and Rg8 requires one more tempo than White currently has.  He plans to force the exchange of his rook for the opportunity to queen h8.} Kc2 {Now, d1 cannot be stopped, and the rook 'sacrifice' must be given.} 55. Ra3 Rxa3 {Black captures.  Avoiding the capture leads to the same endgame, minus queens. } 56. h8=Q {White queens first.  } d1=Q {White is down a rook, his only hope is to get a king and rook fork with his queen, or to hurdle the king for the rook.  The problem he faces is that the black rook can block the attack on the king, because they are on adjacent ranks.  Meanwhile, Black can intercede with the queen whenever the rook is protected, offering the exchange of queens. } 57. Qe5 {White centralizes his Queen.  Still, the force of the Black Queen and Rook combined will quickly win.  Black's plan is to trade queens.  In order to do this, he needs to control potential forking squares.  A hurdle does not look possible, so only a pin or fork will avail; but the pinning or forking piece must be protected.  As an example, if d6 were now protected by the rook, Qd6 would pin the white queen and force an exchange.} Qd3 {Black centralizes his Queen and moves to take away any meaningful move by the White Queen.  Black intends to protect the rook with the queen and to avoid moving into a hurdle position with the rook.  } 58. Kg3 {The White King seeks a safer post.} Ra6 {The rook remains protected by the queen, and threatens Rg6 .  Observe the lines and squares:  Now, Blacks' Qb6 pins the white Queen, the rook is protected by his own queen and views Rg6 , where he will still be protected by his queen.   } 59. Qc5+ {Although the game is lost for white, I like Kf2 as a defensive move much better than this move.  The checks will end sometime, and it seems the king would be much more difficult to mate when he is within his pawns and the white queen can intervene to block the black queen or to check the Black king.  } Kb3 {There is no square from which the White Queen can check, and so Black makes progress.  Qc6  now forks and exchanges the Queens; however, Black would like to first obtain a better position, nearer the white pawns, with his King.    } 60. Qe5 {Oops!  Now, Qc6 pins the White Queen.} Rg6+ {Yes, Qd6 pins the White queen and exchanges.   Black plays what he views as a zwischenzug, to get a better position for his rook and king when the queens exchange.    } 61. Kh2 {The best escape square.} Kc2 {Black again neglects Qd6 in his quest for an improved position!   Still not playing Qd6!  In retrospect Qd6 is the fastest way for Black to end the game.    } 62. Qf4 {Oops!  White also missed ... Qd6.  Still, this appears to be the best move.  It is always dangerous to leave two important pieces on the same line. However, the White queen denies h6 to the rook.   } Qd6 {The exchange is forced.    In conclusion.  White finished the opening with the initiative.  White focused on the play on e5 while Black was most concerned with gaining the initiative, and was willing to give material in order to have it.   Once into the middle game, White was intent on carrying out his attack and Black developed his plan to use the queenside pawns to produce a queen.   Still, Black had to respect White's attack while husbanding the pawns.  Once the initiative changed hands, Black began trading pieces in order to reach a pawn ending.  In the ending, White may have lost tempi and Black played to conserve tempi and to queen.  The race to queen was a draw, but White had to give up his rook in order to get his queen.  That left Black with an overwhelming material advantage and Black played to exchange Queens.  The game was decided by tempi.  Black developed his pieces earlier and even though a knight short (for two pawns), he slowly encroached on the space and his pieces gained force.  White may have been intent on his attack just a little longer than prudent.  It's hard for an attacking player to give up the attack.   White's loss of tempo left him with a backward end game.  Here are some lessons from this game: 1.   It is worthwhile to pause when the pawn structure becomes fairly certain and to see the board as if the pieces were removed.  Then one can see the probable endgame and can husband and position the proper pawns and hold the right pieces.  2.   Serendipity loses to planning.  In the middle game, players often have their full focus on the tactical possibilities.  It is important to pause and plan. 3.   The danger in offering a gambit is that if the opponent withstands the attack, he usually gets the better endgame.   4.   Time and space offer temporary advantages and must be respected on every move of the game.  The questions are always:  Who has the initiative?  Can I gain/lose tempo?  How can I empower my pieces (Gaining space)?  }
