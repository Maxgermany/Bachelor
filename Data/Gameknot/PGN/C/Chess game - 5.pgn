1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 {Not one of the two moves I usually see but reasonable. ( Qd8 and Qa5 are the usual replies. )} 4. d4 Nf6 5. Be3 c6 6. Bd3 h6 {I wasn't sure what this move did but Black may be falling a little behind in development.} 7. Nge2 {I thought black was perhaps looking to pin with Bg4 if I played Nf3. And this could allow white to play Bf4 at some point while also providing support for d4.} Bg4 {This has no sting since f3 is a decent reply. } 8. f3 Bh5 {This sets up an interesting possibility for white but first I want to prepare to castle.} 9. Qd2 Nbd7 {White can now break up blacks pawns!} 10. g4 Bg6 11. Bxg6 fxg6 12. O-O-O e6 {Looking to complete his development but he now has weaknesses to protect.} 13. Bf4 Qb4 14. Qd3 Kf7 {It's the only way to hold the pawn!} 15. Rhg1 {The threat is g5.  which would perhaps open the g file on the pawn at g6.} Nd5 {now if g5 black plays h5 and keeps the g6 pawn safe.  While usually exchanges should decrease the pressure, here one of black's few developed pieces leaves the board.} 16. Nxd5 cxd5 17. Bd2 {Threatening the Queen is actually just a time gain to post the knight where it wants to go at f4.  The bishop had to move to allow the threat on g6.} Qd6 {I thought Qa4 would be better as white would need to play Kb1 and the gain of time is negated. Black could then play Be7 and Nf8 to protect the pawn on g6. But ...} 18. f4 {Change of plan.  On Nf4 black can simplify to an endgame only a pawn down with 18. ..., e5 19. dxe5, Nxe5 20.Qxd5ch, Qxd5 21. Nxd5 and White may win the endgame but I decided to try and keep the attack going.  The threat is f5!} Nf6 19. f5 gxf5 {Not what I expected, 19. ..., exf5 20. gxf5, g5 might have been better.} 20. gxf5 Ne4 21. fxe6+ Qxe6 22. Rdf1+ {The attack looks quite good but black finds a way to simplify.} Ke7 23. Nf4 Qa6 {White will be a pawn up now with the c and d pawns rolling. I should probably have taken the exchange with Ng6 but I was focused on the two passed pawns. } 24. Qxa6 bxa6 25. Nxd5+ Kd6 26. Nc3 Nxd2 27. Kxd2 g5 {black wants to be able to move his black squared bishop. but white is still better developed and it matters.} 28. Rf6+ Kd7 29. Rf7+ {Taking the pawn on a3 doesn't really matter.  Keeping the bishop off the long diagonal and perhaps forcing the king back is more important. We also set up doubling the rooks with some threats.} Ke6 30. Rgf1 {There is a threat here, do you see it?} Bb4 {Black finally develops the bishop and wants to double white's pawns but ...} 31. Rf1f6# {Mate! I hope you enjoyed the game please comment and rate.}
