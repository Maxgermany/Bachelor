[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange variation"]

1. e4 {I begin with my usual King's Pawn Opening.} e5 2. Nf3 {Developing and threatening black's e-pawn.} Nc6 {Defending the e-pawn. Now I must decide whether to play Bc4 or Bb5.} 3. Bb5 {I stick with what I know and play the Ruy Lopez. I only experiment with openings in unrated games or against a computer.} a6 {Kicking the bishop.} 4. Bxc6 {I choose to exchange. I know that Ba4 is preferred, but I play better when the board is less cluttered (the position is simplified somewhat).} bxc6 {This is a bit of an inaccuracy, because it only creates an open file for the rook, which won't be used until later on, while dxc6 opens up a file for the queen and a long diagonal for the LSB.} 5. O-O {I castle, bringing my king into a safe position.} Bd6 {This defends the e-pawn, but prevents the move of the d-pawn, postponing the effective development of the LSB (the a-pawn and the c6-pawn are preventing Bb7 from being an effective development).} 6. Nc3 {I continue development.} Nf6 {He develops and gets ready to castle.} 7. d4 {I open up the position.} exd4 8. Nxd4 O-O {Black castles.} 9. Nf3 {I bring my knight back, to threaten a fork with e5.} Bb7 {?? This allows me to win a piece with the fork.} 10. e5 Be7 {Black chooses to lose his knight. Moving his bishop was a good choice, because it allows the d-pawn to move.} 11. exf6 Bxf6 {I have won a piece for a pawn.} 12. Bf4 {I have plans to attack sooner or later, but first, I complete minor piece development.} h6 {I'm not too sure what this was meant to accomplish.} 13. Ne4 {Kicking the bishop.} g5 {? I can win a pawn from this, and black has messed up his kingside.} 14. Nxf6+ {I can liquidate as well.} Qxf6 15. Bxc7 {I'm now ahead by a full piece.} Qxb2 {?? This allows me to win a piece by skewering the queen to the bishop.} 16. Rb1 Qxa2 {Now that the queen has moved, I can capture the bishop.} 17. Rxb7 Qe6 {Moving the queen, possibly planning an attack of sorts.} 18. Re1 {Kicking the queen.} Qf5 19. Re5 {Getting the rook into the fight with tempo.} Qh7 {Away from the action.} 20. h3 {Now, this was not a great move. What would have been better?} Qg7 {Black has constrained his queen further, because my defended rook is in the way.} 21. Qxd7 {I take the chance to gobble a pawn.} g4 {? This gives away a free pawn.} 22. hxg4 Qxg4 {?? This gives away a free queen, which I can take with check.} 23. Qxg4+ {Faced with a weak position and an overwhelming material disadvantage, black resigns. Thanks for the game, rogerb23.}
