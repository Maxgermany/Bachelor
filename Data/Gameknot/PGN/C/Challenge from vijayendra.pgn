1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 e5 3. Nf3 exd4 {Scotch} 4. Nxd4 Nxd4 5. Qxd4 c5 6. Qa4 a6 7. c4 Bd6 8. Be2 Nf6 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Bg5 Be5 11. f4 Bxc3+ 12. bxc3 Qb6 13. Qc2 Qe6 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 15. O-O {White has a formidable centre and the doubled c-pawn is not a weakness as it provides open b& d files.} d6 16. Rab1 {Utilising the open file and preventing Black bishop from developing} Rb8 17. Rb6 {Blokade b-pawn and pinning d6 pawn} Rd8 18. Qd3 {White has to protect c-pawn and f-pawn so the rook at f1 can move. Ideal square will be g3 which threatens Blacks king as well} Ra8 19. Qg3 a5 20. Rfb1 {Again to prevent Black Bishop movement. } a4 21. a3 {Blacks pawns are blocked and Black  bishop has become a 'bad' one} Rb8 22. Ra6 {...axb6(R) will lead to Rxb8(R), entry for the rook to 8th rank} Bd7 {Black avoids it. But d6-pawn loses support from R at d8} 23. e5 {take advantage of the pin at d6.} Qg6 {Grab the d6 pawn after exchange at g6. If ....Qf5 then Bd3} 24. Qxg6 hxg6 25. Rxd6 Bc6 26. Rbd1 {do not give up control of open file} Rde8 27. Kf2 {Centralize the king as endgame is approaching} Re6 28. Bg4 Rxd6 29. Rxd6 {echange is all the better for white} f5 {Black did not expect en passent} 30. exf6 e.p. gxf6 31. Rxf6 {another pawn falls} Kg7 32. Re6 {Laying trap if ...Bd7 then Re7  wins the bishop. If ....Rd8 then Ke3} Re8 {Black did not fall for the trap. But exchange will favor white as he is two pawns up} 33. Rxe8 Bxe8 34. Bf3 b5 {Interesting position!. If 35.Bd5 b4! 36.cxb4 cxb4 37.axb4 Bc6!! Bxc6 is a taboo. If 38Bxc6 a3! and the Black's a-pawn is unstoppable. White's Bishop can not stop a-pawn due to its own pawn at c4. If White avoids capture by Be6 Black will play Bd7. Any other move, black will simply push a-pawn} 35. cxb5 {So White captures the pawn. With 2 pawns up it is a sure win} Bxb5 36. Ke3 {bringing king to centre for active play} Kf6 37. Be4 {Prevent Black king's advance} g5 38. fxg5+ Kxg5 39. Bd5 Kf5 40. h3 Kg5 41. Ke4 Bf1 42. Ke5 Kh4 43. Kd6 c4 44. Kc5 Kg3 45. Kb4 Bxg2 46.
