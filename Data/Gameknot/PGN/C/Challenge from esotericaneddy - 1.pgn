1. e4 c6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Bg4 4. Bd3 {Ok.  This move is a bit of a "sin". In the first part of a chess game players seek to bring their pieces into play and get their King into a safe spot. This bisshop move has the disadvantage of blocking the pawn behind it and this makes it more difficult to "develop" the other bisshop. } e6 5. h3 Bh5 6. g4 Bg6 7. Ne5 Nd7 8. Nxg6 hxg6 9. Rg1 {This is a slight oversight ... I can now take the white "h" pawn.} Rxh3 10. g5 Ne5 11. Ke2 {That's a brave move. But the King will prove quite vulnerable out in the open. Maybe you could have tried to move your white bisshop instead.} Nf3 12. Rg2 Nd4+ 13. Kf1 Rh1+ 14. Rg1 Rxg1+ 15. Kxg1 Qxg5+ 16. Kf1 Qh4 17. Ne2 Qh1+ 18. Ng1 dxe4 19. Bc4 Nf3 20. Be2 Qxg1# {Lessons learned. Try not to block your own pieces. And keep an eye on your King. He should be protected as best as you can.}
