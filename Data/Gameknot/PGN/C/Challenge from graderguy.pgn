1. e4 {Its All Tagg's Fault.  Neither of the two assigned players were actually here and we've decided to blame Tagg. The match was started because I whinged about the level of the players I was being put up against in team matches. Bear in mind I'm really a 1300 who has had a run of luck.... Grader decided to check it out....} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. Nc3 O-O {Belated switch to 4 knights.... not my favourite.... basically anything that isn't the spanish or italian isn't my favourite. And bear in mind he beat the snot out of me in the last game. Got to go cautious and hedgehog the defences right.....} 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bxf6 {Well.... cautious(ish)} Qxf6 8. Nd5 Qd6 9. c3 Qg6 10. O-O d6 11. Nxc7 Rb8 {I figured free pawn and a safe spot to retreat to. One of my weaknesses, I can't resist free pawns even if, as in this case it costs me two tempos and the nasty little trap he is about to come up with. I really should know better.} 12. Nd5 Bh3 13. g3 Bxf1 14. Kxf1 b5 15. Bb3 Qh5 16. a4 a6 17. axb5 axb5 18. Nd2 {All over the place at this point, trying to make the pieces work together and its not happening. Hadn't even realised till just now that I'd left the h pawn open giving a double threat on f pawn next move, bye bye king cover.} Qh3+ 19. Kg1 f5 20. Nf4+ {The move which won it. Purely fortuitous, it wasn't planned at all and indeed at that point I'd been crying in my milkshake about disgracing myself yet again. The squeals of indignation from my opponent were pretty funny though ;-)} Kh7 21. Nxh3 g5 22. Kg2 {Could see the knight getting trapped, so trying to give it an out.} g4 23. Ng1 Rbd8 24. exf5 {Again an unhealthy obsession with pawns. rxp I nab a free pawn with the queen. Thinking is a luxury I must indulge in at some point.....} Rxf5 25. Qxg4 Rxf2+ {Cos I forgot about the bishop guard.} 26. Kh3 Rxd2 27. Qf5+ {Ok, well still leading, lets poke him around and see what happens. Favourite pastime when I don't really know what I'm doing, I keep attacking and hope for an opportunity to deliver a killer.} Kg7 28. Qf7+ Kh8 29. Qg6 Rd7 {That surprised me. I'd expected B-e3 which to the limited understanding I have pretty much stops the line I was following. Instead of that it seems like a very weak move exposing his back line and pinning one of his rooks.} 30. Qxh6+ Rh7 31. Ra8+ Nd8 32. Rxd8# {So now I'm stuck with whatever grading they stick me up against. And its all Taggs fault the miserable ******}
