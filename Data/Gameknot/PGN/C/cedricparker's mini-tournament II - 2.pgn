1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 e6 4. b3 c5 5. Bb2 Nc6 {I've been experimenting with this Zukertort setup for White.} 6. a3 {To prevent Nb5.} Bd6 7. Be2 a6 8. O-O O-O 9. Nbd2 b5 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. c4 dxc4 12. bxc4 b4 13. axb4 Bxb4 14. Qc2 Bb7 15. Rfd1 Qe7 {Here I think the game is fairly equal.  Both players have decent minor pieces and each has an isolated pawn.  The idea, I think, is to try to provoke a weakness.} 16. Ng5 {Threatening Bxf6 followed by Qxh7#.} g6 17. Ngf3 Rfd8 18. Nb3 Nd7 19. Nbd4 Rac8 20. Nxc6 Rxc6 21. Nd4 Rc5 22. Bc3 Bxc3 23. Qxc3 Bd5 {I think the idea behind this--pinning the c4 pawn while attacking it--is good, but it didn't work in execution.} 24. Qa3 {Pinning the Rook against the hanging Queen.  If the Bd5 moves away, Nb3 wins the exchange.} Bxg2 25. Kxg2 Rg5+ {Priority of check keeps White from grabbing Black's Queen.} 26. Kf1 Qf6 27. Nc6 {Attacking the Rook.  If the Rook moves away, the N falls.} Rf5 {Black tries to bear down on f2.  Again a good idea but flawed in execution.} 28. Ne7+ {Black resigned here in view of the loss of the exchange, after already being down a piece for a pawn.}
