[Opening "Bird's opening (A02)"]

1. f4 {This is not a conventional opening.  It's understandable, if this were a KG, where you started with 1.e4, e5 2.f4  But, otherwise, it's like the Damiano's Defense.  So, you don't want to advance the f pawn so early.  That's because, as I learned with TA's blitz Q sac, that I used to teach a student when he opened with that defense, the f file is considered the weakest square on the chess board.  If it's moved early in the game, one could win up in trouble.  Better was 1.e4, 1.c4, or 1.d4 which are most analyzed by GM's.} c5 {My guess is that Sue is playing, as though it were the Siclian Defense since she knows the line.  The idea is playing what you're comfortable, and I understand that quite well.  When it wasn't the French, but rather, I believe, the Ruy Lopez, I kicked the N.  Well, that's because I listened to the lecture by GM Susan Polgar, on the Terrasch Variation, and with the Ruy Lopez, I could apply it as such.  In fact, archduke_piccolo says that it works, quite well, but you have to be aware that some moves in one opening won't work in another.  But, it does here.} 2. e3 {Getting a nice pawn chain, in the process, and opening up a line for for his LSB.  However, I prefer black's position.} Nf6 {Therefore, Sue gets right to it by developing.} 3. Bd3 {So does John.} d6 {Opening up a line for his LSB.  Normally, I'd take back what I said, but his white's next move is about to change.} 4. h3 {?! That's because of continuing with development, John advances his wing pawn.} e6 {?! So, Sue prepares to punish John for that.  The only problem with that is that black will be left with two bad bishops.  The idea being that both will be blocked by her pawns.  It's premature to say that both will stay like that, but what we know, is that one will remain for a while.  It's not too early to conclude that since charleshiggie said something in his most recent annotation.} 5. g4 {?! The idea is to gain tempo by kicking Sue's Nf6.  However, the time could have been used to develop his Ng1 and prepare to castle.} Nc6 {However, Sue uses that tempo to develop another piece.} 6. g5 {?! This was the plan behind 5.g4, but now, with what I noted it's safe to say that it was pointless.  Normally, I don't jump to that conclusion except that black can and will protect.  So, the threat was, in my books, a waste of time since black is already better developed then white.} Nd7 {! Best, believe it or not.  I looked at 6...Nd5, but white would reattack with 7.e4, and after something like 7...Nb4, the N would be forced to the rim, where it would not be worth as much.  And, later on, an exchange might ensue, and in this position, Sue's Knight's are more dangerous then her bishops, since they're better placed, making this a closed position, as of the moment.} 7. h4 {John is still pushing pawns, as opposed to, continue with development.  As kenneth_fiore 3 has put it, this is asking for trouble.} e5 {Especially with this move because if John were to exchange, Sue would be more then happy as she can recapture with her Nd7.  Not only would this leave her with a good bishop, but it would be, potentially dangerous, whereas, white has only one piece developed.} 8. f5 {John advances.  But, in this position, I would've exchanged on e5.} d5 {Strengthening her Bf8, as now, Sue will be able to develop her DSB without it being cramped.  I once lost a game by leaving my Bishop crammed, and having it confined to either e7 or d7, as black.} 9. g6 {Continuing to push pawns, as opposed to following the guidelines.} Bd6 {It's understandable that Sue wants to develop.  I used to do the same thing and then took a while to realize that there are exceptions to guidelines.  This is one of them, so best was 9...hxg6, winning a pawn, whilst, capturing towards the center.  That's because if John responds with 10.fxg5, black can answer with 10...Rxh4, and with the Queen, white does not get anything if he plays 11.Rxh4.} 10. Qh5 {Bringing the Q out, before continuing with his development.} Nb6 {?? Bringing the Knight to a better outpost.  But, best was 10...Nf6, Sue.  Not only is this better placed, but at the same time, John would have to suffer the consequences of bringing his Queen out too soon.  The idea being is the gain of time since it's attacked, which would force him to protect.  And, when he does, you'd be able to use that time to get your monarch to safety with 11...0-0  After which you're fine.  But, by playing this, your opportunity to castle is gone.  And, your weakest pawn is gone which will leave your monarch exposed.  Therefore, he now has the initiative.} 11. gxf7+ Ke7 12. f6+ {Dishing in another check.} Kxf6 {Which appears to be a nuicanse, but remember that your weakest pawn is removed, Sue.  That, as id=tactical-abyss emphasizes in his Q sacs are very important.  John has some dangerous threats now.} 13. Nf3 {It starts with this move, as now, John's Queen, Nf3, and Rh1 are all a danger.  In other words, he's mobilizing his Q side to do some serious damage.} Be6 {Threatening his f7 pawn.  But, John could play something that I think would end the game, at once.  Can you see this, Sue?} 14. Qg5+ {Best was 14.Ng5, with a forced mating sequence, believe it or not.  The idea being is that the King would have to get out, but it's pinned.  Therefore, what would come after is 15.Rf1+, Bf5 (forced) 16.Rxf5#  Or, 14.Ng5, Bf5, but after 15.Rf1!, there is no way because the LSB is pinned.  And, when white takes, it would still be mate.  But, by playing this, black has some play left.  } Kxf7 15. Qh5+ {So, he plays this.} Kg8 {Better was 15...g6, Sue, as now, John is forced to protect his Queen.  Either by exchanging with 16.Qg5, or 16.Qh6, which brings it out of play.  However, the danger would not be, as bad as, what we're about to see.} 16. Ng5 Qe7 {?? This is how Sue responds, but it is a super blunder because of John's next move which should win quickly.} 17. Bxh7+ Rxh7 18. Nxh7 {But, he missed it.  Best was to capture the other way with 18.Qxh7+, as now, Sue would be forced to lose her LSB and remaining Rook to avoid mate.  It would continue with 18...Kf8 (forced) 19.Qh8+, Bg8 (forced, which leaves it pinned) 20.Rf1+, Ke8 (also forced) 21.Qxg8+, Kd7 22.Rxa8  There was only one other option after 21.Qxg8+, but no good would be 21...Qf8, as now, not only would Sue lose her Q for a R, but John would mate with, 22.Rxf8+, Bxf8 23.Qf7+, Kd8 24.Ne6+, Kc8 25.Qc7#} d4 {The idea is to exchange pawns.} 19. Rg1 {But, John does not switch, yet, as he has something better.  So, things are still dangerous for Sue.  } dxe3 20. dxe3 Bd5 {Unlike before, I don't know why Sue played this.} 21. Nc3 {But John attacks it, whilst, developing another piece, at last.} Nb4 {Threatening a dangerous fork, which John needs to be aware of.  Otherwise, he could lose his advantage.} 22. e4 {?? With that being said, this is a blunder.  It's understandable that John wanted Sue's Bd5 out of there.  But, better was 22.Kd2, but he'd still lose his right to castle.  Therefore, best was 22.Qd1, preventing that without weakening the K side.  With that being said, in this position, how should black proceed, Sue?} Bc6 {?? Protecting the Bishop, but best was 22...Nxc2+, and after John gets out of check, black has 23...Nxa1, and even if then 24.exd5, after Sue takes back with her Nb4 or Nb6, she still winds up ahead.  By failing to play this, as much as I hate to say it, but black is lost with best play.} 23. Nd5 {Going after the Queen.} Qe6 {And, Sue makes the right choice by retreating.  I know that she, likely, considered exchanging.  But, my student remembered what I recently which is that, when behind, the one thing you don't want to do is exchange pieces.  That's known as liquidation which benefits the one that's ahead.  However, John's next move will be almost overwhelming.} 24. Ng5 {Not only attacking the Queen, but threatening a dangerous check.} Qe8 {?? This, however, is the losing blunder, Sue.  It protects the Queen, but your only option, was 24...Qh6, in this position.  As much as, I don't like exchanging when behind, liquidation of Queen's is more or less forced, to prevent what's bound to come.  That's because his Queen is even more dangerous, which is also important to keep in mind.  } 25. Qh7+ Kf8 {Forced.} 26. Rf1+ Qf7 {Also forced since both of John's Knights, prevents Sue from getting out with her monarch since it can't move.  Therefore, he is going to win her Queen for a Knight.} 27. Nxf7 {But, he missed an immediate mate.  With that being said, best was 27.Qh8#} Ke8 {Preventing the immediate 27...Nxd6#.  But, John, however, has an inevitable mating sequence, anyhow.} 28. Nxd6+ Kd7 29. Qxg7+ Kxd6 30. Rf6# {The overall morals to this story is that it's important to be aware of all threats made by your opponent.  That's important because she started with an advantage early on but lost it by allowing white to take away her weakest pawn.  This also applies to John because he overlooked a Knight fork, by playing 22.e4?? That fork would've lost a P+R, for a bishop which would've given Sue back her advantage.  But, the other lesson is, even though, you generally don't want to liquidate pieces when behind, there are times where this is a must.  So, to figure this out, it's important to evaluate what piece is more dangerous.  With that being said, had Sue allowed an exchange with 24...Qe8, she might have gotten counterplay.  Even if not, she would've lasted longer.  @knightrider62: This is also important to keep in mind, in case you wind up with a similar situation, in the future.  The idea being is that it's essential to access the positions carefully.  If you can remember this and the other lesson, you will make further improvements, faster then you might realize.}
