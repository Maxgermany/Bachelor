1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Nc6 {'A questionable move. It is usually not a very good idea to obstruct the c-pawn in a Queen's Pawn Game, because the c-pawns are what you use to gain a better center by challenging opponent's d-pawn.} 3. d4 {1.d4 is not a very good move on move 1, but now it is OK because opponent can no longer challenge it with c5!} h6 {wasted time} 4. Bg2 {I get bishop to best diagonal, typical of a Catalan} e6 {bolstering d5 trying to} 5. O-O {I have a lead in development} Nf6 {two Knight's defense similarities} 6. c4 {Queen's Gambit similarities} dxc4 {Queen's Gambit Accepted Similarities} 7. Qa4 {I think I have a winning position because I won a central pawn for flank pawn. Black did not understand that obstructing c-pawn is bad in a queen's pawn game. I exploited that principle quite nicely, yielding a neat pawn center for myself, and Black's position is left in shambles where his pieces will hardly have anywhere to amble.} Bd7 {challenges my queen} 8. Qxc4 {but I get the center} a6 {trying to challenge again with b5} 9. Rd1 {I challenge Black queen my moving rook to d-file where it is scary} b5 {trying to get queen away} 10. Qc2 {calm retreat} Nb4 {the knight moves to a bad square trying to chase the Q} 11. Qd2 {calm retreat} Ne4 {the knight moves undefended trying to chase} 12. Qf4 {so queen attacks not worried about c2 because two knights are stronger than rook in every single variation.} Nf6 {so get out} 13. Nc3 {I develop more} Nbd5 {the knight is extra} 14. Nxd5 {usually unprincipled to capture an extra piece but I decided that it is OK to employ my center properly. } Nxd5 {so knight attacks my queen,} 15. Qd2 {and queen batteries} Bb4 {attacks again really has a thing for her} 16. Qc2 {calm retreat again only for display not for capturing} Bd6 {so get out} 17. e4 {and i improve on my center control of center most important thing in chess} Nb4 {and downgrades his knight position to get another look at the fine bikini clad queen} 18. Qe2 {calm retreats again} O-O {castles} 19. Be3 {and develops another piece to control the center, ON TOP of that I also have prospects of bringing a knight to c5 and major pieces along the c-file to replace that knight and win the c7-pawn later} Nc6 {knight retreats} 20. Rac1 {developing last piece to optimal location. It is very bad that Black obstructed c-pawn in the opening. This is a good example of how to win against an opponent who does so. I will channel all pieces along the c-file and win the c7-pawn in the future.} e5 {a blunder, Black allows me to exploit superior advantage in the center} 21. Rxc6 {I win 2 pieces for rook, a resignable advantage} Bxc6 {takes} 22. dxe5 {winning pinned bishop along d-file} Bxe4 {takes} 23. exd6 {takes} cxd6 {takes} 24. Bc5 {attacking pinned pawn} Re8 {x-ray to my queen} 25. Bxd6 {winning pawn} Bxf3 {trade} 26. Qxf3 {take} Rc8 {move} 27. Qd3 {battery} Qf6 {intent} 28. Ba3 {retreat} Rcd8 {attack} 29. Qf1 {retreat} Rxd1 {exchange} 30. Qxd1 {ok} Rd8 {attack} 31. Qf3 {ok calm} Qxf3 {trade? not so good because bishops become more valuable after a queen trade} 32. Bxf3 {bishops more valuable now} Rc8 {so he tries to win some pawns} 33. Kg2 {intent center} a5 {tries to win a piece} 34. Bd6 {get out} b4 {move} 35. a3 {threatening to win pawn} Rd8 {allows} 36. Bc7 {skewer} Rd2 {pig in the 2nd} 37. Bxa5 {takes} Rxb2 {takes} 38. Bxb4 {Black cannot compete with the extreme complementarity of my pawn and bishops, so Black resigned.}
