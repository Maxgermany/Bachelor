1. e4 {Good first opening move for white,puts a stake in the center controlling f5 d5 squares allows the bishop and queen to develop.} c5 {The only way in my opinion to challenge direct 1.e4 with the most played Sicilian lines.} 2. Bc4 {Nice move here by Richard,puts pressure on the f7 square and lends opposition to the d5 square,and clears a space on whites bank rank development.} Nc6 {With this move my aim as per opening strategy is to keep an eye on the e5 and d4 also b4 squares.} 3. Nf3 {This is a good developing move by Richard controls a lot of black squares,h4 g5 and most importantly the e5 square.and support for the d4 possible push.The main idea in any game of chess is to develop ones pieces as fast as possible to good positions.Never push more than 2 pawns in the opening stage unless for good solid reason!} Nf6 {3..Nf6  well knights before bishops old rule of development,what does the knight here do?well he will lend support to a possible d5 push later.leaves a space on the castling side of future development,and a empty threat on the e4 square.Still if one can develop with a threat it can make your opponent have to counter the threat in some cases at the cost of a move.} 4. Nc3 {A standard developing move here by white,defends e4 looks to the d5 and b5 squares.Knights can become good adversary's when they gain good outposts.} e6 {here i played 4..e6 locks down the d5 square opens a line for my f8 bishop allows a flight square for the knight on c6 if needed.supports a further d5 push later if required.} 5. a3 {I would of played the stronger developing move here with 5.Bb5-d5 6.exd5-exd5 7.0-0-Be7 8.d4.0-0 9.dxc5-Bxc5 10.h3-h6} a6 6. a4 {6.d4 to challange the center move played by white looses a tempo.} Bd6 7. O-O {7.d3 allowing the c1 bishop to enter the game!!} Bb8 {7...0-0 would of been better here for black} 8. g3 {8.d4 more in keeping with trying to control the center!!} b6 9. d3 h6 10. Ba2 Bb7 11.
