[Opening "Dunst (Sleipner, Heinrichsen) opening (A00)"]

1. Nc3 {This game is a superb example of the Dunst (Sleipner, Heinrichsen) opening and all its subtleties. White will use constant pressure and ferocious tactics, forcing black to find narrow escapes time and again. It is truly a clash of the titans! Enjoy!} c6 2. Nf3 g5 {Here black opts to go with the seldom-used Gertrude's Gambit.} 3. Nxg5 {White accepts.} f6 {the standard follow-up...} 4. Nxh7 {But the crafty knight gets away! And steals another pawn to boot! Now black must find a way out of this predicament...} d6 {Cleverly develops his d pawn...} 5. d4 {White breaks up his structurally-sound, pawn-wall-of-solitude.} Rxh7 {And black strikes! But will bringing out his rook too early come back to haunt him?} 6. e4 e5 7. Be3 b6 {Black's iron-pawn-curtain begins to creep up the board...} 8. d5 c5 9. Nb5 a6 {And the final pawn is out! Notice how black's rook is now in complete control of the open rank!} 10. Nxd6+ {White swipes the pawn for check but black is unconcerned...} Kd7 {Casually develops his king into the open rank...} 11. Nxc8 Qxc8 12. Bc4 b5 {Now black has gained the offensive. It seems that white will be powerless to stop this encroaching pawn barrier, but miraculously he finds a way!} 13. Bxb5+ {Smash!} axb5 14. Bxc5 {Smash!} Bxc5 15. O-O {Beautiful!! White has left the poor pawn brigade in tatters and castled his king to safety. And all he had to give up were his two useless bishops! --Now we enter the middle game and both players realize they must gain the utmost tempo out of their next moves...} Ke8 {Nice...} 16. Kh1 {Breathtaking!!! They reposition their most powerful pieces to seemingly innocuous squares -- but black must be especially rattled here - fearing that white's king might move over one more square and disappear off the board!} Nh6 {Fortunately he knows that move #16 is precisely the best time to bring your knights into the game.} 17. b3 f5 18. f3 f4 {It's a stranglehold, no one backing down...} 19. Qe2 {White finds an attack on a hanging pawn plus the threat of check. How does black respond?} Ba3 {With that... Clearly you can see the genius of it and I don't need to explain it.} 20. Qxb5+ {Check!} Kf7 {A deft side-step} 21. b4 Qxc2 {BAM!!! With one swift stroke we see the genius of black's plan come to full fruition. He just smashed that pawn up all to hell!! White is left reeling, with little to no good options...} 22. Qb7+ {Desperately, he finds a weak check + fork on a defenseless rook. Clearly nowhere near as powerful as that pawn smash on the previous move.} Kg6 23. Qxa8 Qb2 {Protects his bishop, in full control...} 24. Rfb1 Qd4 {Runs away... Still supremely confidant from that previous pawn-smash...} 25. Rbd1 Qb6 {Moves over here to protect his knight - just daring white to take his bishop...} 26. Qa4 {But white resists!! Somehow, some way, he saw... something... that told him not to take that bishop! Incredible!} Bxb4 {Now black is the one who's clearly rattled as he takes the free pawn.} 27. Rdb1 {White pins... Is there a way out of this?} Bc3 {Yes!!! What a move! White is taken by complete surprise!} 28. Qe8+ {He tries to recover...} Nf7 29. Qg8+ {Desperately throwing checks at black... Clearly nothing better to do...} Kh5 30. g4+ {Surely black considered the en passent here but eventually decided against it.} Kh4 {And now we can clearly see that white is in serious trouble... With hope fading fast, he makes a desperate attempt to gain some material...} 31. Qxb8 Qg6 32. Rbf1 {Provides much-needed protection of his f pawn, should it come under attack.} Bd4 {Black maneuvers the bishop masterfully. No need to take that rook when in such a dominant position...} 33. Rab1 Ng5 34. Rb4 Nh3 35. Rxd4 {Black has set the trap brilliantly... White just playing into his hands...} Qh6 {And there it is!! The devastating queen-rook-combo-with-a-traffic-jam-in-between-the-king! White will be powerless to stop it unless he does something about it in the next several moves.} 36. Qxe5 Qa6 {Wham!! A shocking move by black which threatens mate-in-one, but ALSO threatens the isolated pawn on the side of the board. What will white do about this?} 37. Rd2 {Protects the pawn... Very wise. That rook can take care of himself.} Rh6 {And... then there's that move... Okay!! How about that move?!!} 38. Qb2 {Here white makes DOUBLE-SURE that that pawn is guaranteed-damn-protected. There is absolutely no way he is going to let this guy come in and smash another one of his pawns all up to hell! Absolutely no damn way. And I applaud him for it.} Qxf1# {But then he loses...}
