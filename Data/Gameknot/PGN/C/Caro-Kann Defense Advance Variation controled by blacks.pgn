1. e4 {Find here is a game that illustrates a Caro-Kann Defense: Advance Variation (B12).  nota: This opening has been more and more played since 1990.  } c6 {Caro-kann advance variation's stats: White wins 40.0% Black wins 27.3% Draws 32.6%} 2. d4 {c6 doesn't mean you abandon the center. You are even not late. It is like a call on whites cards and intentions.} d5 {There are some N variations of the Caro-Kann my knowledge of them are limited.  Also Tarrash responded (1889) e5 on d4 played by Amos Burn. } 3. e5 {Caro-Kann Defense advance variation position Blacks have options (Bf5/C5/F6!/etc.) even if there is an advanced e5. This position gives me focus on e5 and d4. Once d5 is down whites are mostly done as I know that many players can not resist to play e5.} c5 {The first step to get ride of e5 is to attack strongly d4. The game between V. Promyshlyanskiy vs Daniel Fridman during the LGA Premium Cup (09/08/2006) illustrates it. } 4. c3 cxd4 5. cxd4 Nc6 6. a3 {a3 is so soon... Oh well I guess I won't play Bb4 . I played a useless Bc5 instead.} Bf5 7. f3 e6 8. h4 Qb6 {I still don't know whites intention, } 9. Ne2 {the first mistake is not to target Bf5 ...} Bxb1 {I must admit that I didn't see the coming combination firstly...} 10. Rxb1 Bxa3 {1 pawn down. whites would not let the quality and a messed Queen's side } 11. b3 Bb4+ {Bb4 file is a very strong position up in the opponent's camp.} 12. Kf2 {The King is moving on f3 in order to let the Q and the N to protect d4. } Nge7 {N e7 is a silly move as I had an other free pawn ... and not the least important ... e4 ( Nxe4)} 13. Be3 {Nxe4 is no more reasonably playable.} Nf5 {I didn't notice the strengh of this move and I had no idea how to attack here.} 14. g4 Nxe3 15. Kxe3 {only now I understand what I said earlier... shooter56 brings his King to e3. Not the best place to be for a King... and now I won't miss Nxe4... } Nxe5 16. Bh3 {shooter56 shows me that if I castle (0-0) he could have a strong attack on the K's side.} Nc6 17. f4 {as often I have no idea of what to do against this strange position } O-O-O {0-0-0 could not hurt right now.} 18. Qd3 Kb8 {Kb8 could mean a lost of time but I prefer to have a look at what are shooter's ideas at this point.} 19. g5 e5 {A simple e6-e5 will open the situation. Opening up e files and adding pressure on d4.} 20. Bg2 exd4+ 21. Kf3 Bc3 {I didn't play Rhe8 as I didn't want to let the h7 pawn} 22. Rhd1 g6 23. Nxc3 dxc3 24. Qxc3 {the balck Bishop was meant to be let down here} Rhe8 {I must say that I put shooter back in the game. I have no real advantage on the e files in fact.} 25. Kg3 {But King g3 is miracle for me ... and the last mistake for whites} Re3+ {Re3 ; Shooter56 resigned after this fork.}
