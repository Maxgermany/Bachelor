[Opening "KGA (C37), Muzio gambit, Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 {This is a game between me and my friend patagusto. I decided to annotate it since I think it is has some strategical and tactical themes.} e5 2. f4 {The King's gambit was one of the most important opening in the romantic age of chess. The theory teach us that accepting white's sacrifice is a better choice than refusing it with 2. ... Bc5 or 2. ... d6.} exf4 3. Nf3 g5 {This is the classical line in the KGA. The modern one is 3. ... d5 and is more quiet than this, which can lead to some fireworks.} 4. Bc4 g4 5. O-O {The Muzio gambit. White is ready to sacrifice a whole piece to obtain a decisive development advantage and open lines.} gxf3 6. Qxf3 Qf6 7. e5 Qxe5 {The E-file is now open.} 8. d3 Bh6 9. Nc3 Ne7 10. Bd2 Nbc6 11. Rae1 Qf5 {White's development is finished. All pieces are ready to attack, while black has "only" a material advantage.} 12. Nd5 {White's knight is attacking c7, threatening both the king and the rook. This simple and natural move shows how important is the coordination of pieces.} Kd8 {Black has to defend c7.} 13. Qe2 {The E-file will be decisive. White's increasing the pressure on it.} Nxd5 {Black decides to exchange the knights. Maybe 13. ... Qe6 would be a stronger defense.} 14. Bxd5 Qxd5 {14. ... Qxd5? is a mistake. The weakness on the c3-h8 diagonal is clearly visible. If black would try to save his rook, Bf6  and then Qe7#.} 15. Bc3 {Consequent. White exploits the great dark diagonal weakness.} Qe6 {Black understimates the his weakness on h4-d8 diagonal. Trying to close the E-file with the Q is not enough to defend the position. Perhaps moving 15. ... Bg5 would be a thougher defense.} 16. Qh5 {White's threatens black's queen: another matter that emphasizes the mistake of 15. ... Qe6?} Qg6 {Black's proposing the exchange of the queens to reduce the pressure of white's attack, but, again, is not enough. Anyway, black's position is difficult.} 17. Qxg6 fxg6 {The decisive error, but the situation is compromised. It is interesting noticing the conceptual error of taking with the F pawn instead of H: without making any calculation, we can say that taking with the F pawn is an error because of the opening of the F-line. Strategic principles are always important, also in tactical position!} 18. Bf6+ {The final combination starts.} Ne7 {Forced.} 19. Bxe7+ Ke8 {Forced.} 20. Bg5+ {An interesting combination between two tactical themes: the «windmill attack» (thanks to punkusmartyrus that suggested me the right word) and the «interference» (hope this is right, in italian these themes are called «vortice» and «interferenza»). With a check white gains a tempo to cancel the action of Bh6 removing the threaten on pawn f4, allowing Rf1 to take it. } Kf7 {There's nothing to do for black. It is a forced mate. If 20. ... Kf8 then 21. Bxh6  Kg8 22. Rxf4 ~ 23. Rf8#. After 20. ... Kf7, follows 21. Rxf4 Kg7 (21. ... Kg8 22. Bxh6 ~ 23. Re8#) 22. Re7  Kg8 and mate in the next two moves.} 21. Rxf4+ {Black resigns. A big thanks to patagusto which played this game as black!  There are some important strategic themes in this match: - the importance of development and of center; - the power of open lines; - the weakness on a1-h8 and h4-d8 diagonal; - the importance of strategy principles also in tactical situations; - tactical themes of «whirl» (a little one!) and «interference».}
