1. c4 e5 2. e4 c6 3. a3 d5 {I bring my queen's pawn forward to attack two pawns at once, to attempt to create some space...} 4. Nc3 {...but my opponent declines to take it...} dxe4 {...so I take his king's pawn...} 5. Nxe4 {...and lose my queen's pawn, keeping the bishop in its initial position.} b5 {Now I pressure the first pawn he moved...} 6. c5 {...but he pushes it.} Na6 {Now I try another form of attack...} 7. b4 {...but again he covers his pawn...} Nc7 {...so my knight retreats.} 8. h3 Qd4 {I bring forward my queen to place the knight and rook under attack...} 9. Nc3 {...but he blocks the path to his rook with his knight...} Nd5 {...so I put mine on the attack.} 10. Nge2 {Now my queen is under pressure...} Nxc3 {...so I pressurise his, with my knight, taking his...} 11. Nxc3 {...but end up losing my knight...} Qd7 {...so the queen retreats.} 12. Be2 a5 {Now I pressurise his b-pawn, in an attempt to create more space...} 13. Bg4 {...but his bishop attacks my queen...} Qc7 {...so I move her out of the way...} 14. Bxc8 Qxc8 {...and we end up swapping bishops...} 15. bxa5 Rxa5 {...but keeping my rook in the corner allowed me to take his pawn, in exchange for mine.} 16. Ne4 Nf6 {Now, I attack his remaining knight with mine...} 17. Nd6+ {...but he splits my king and queen...} Bxd6 {...so I remove the knight with my bishop...} 18. cxd6 {...but lose it to the pawn, which can easily be lined up...} Qd7 {...here...} 19. d4 Qxd6 {...and removed.} 20. Qd2 {Now he attacks my rook with his queen...} Ra4 {...so I push it up one rank, to prevent its twin from eventually being exposed. It was wise of me not to capture the pawn there.} 21. dxe5 {Instead he captures mine...} Qxe5+ {...and I do likewise to his with my queen, simultaneously attacking the king and rook, rather than removing the queen...} 22. Kf1 Qxa1 {...and finally, I remove the rook, with a net gain, as 21... Qxd2+ would have been met by either 22. Bxd2 or 22. Kxd2, with no gain (or loss).} 23. Qe3+ Ne4 {I decide to defend high up, with one of my rooks on the 5th rank...} 24. g3 O-O {...and free my knight here.} 25. Kg2 Qc3 {I give the queen the runaround here...} 26. Qf4 Qf6 {...and here...} 27. Qe3 Qxf2+ {...before deciding it's worth removing the pawn...} 28. Qxf2 Nxf2 {...then exchanging queens, as his move forced him to take mine with his...} 29. Kxf2 {...at the expense of my knight. Although my advantage has been reduced, I still have both my rooks against a rook and a bishop, plus two extra pawns. I didn't really like this trade, but I did it for the greater good - to remove White's best piece.} Re8 {I move the rook to give my king more room to manoeuvre, and so the bishop cannot touch the rook...} 30. Rd1 b4 31. axb4 Rxb4 {...and create more space by swapping pawns.} 32. Ba3 Rbe4 {I double up here...} 33. Rd6 Re4e2+ {...and attack the king...} 34. Kf1 Rc2 {...and now I cover my pawn, keeping my rook on the 7th rank...} 35. Bb4 Rc8 {...and use its twin to cover from behind.} 36. Ba5 c5 37. Rd7 c4 {Now my pawn is in enemy territory, and is more of a threat, and most importantly, can't be touched by the bishop...} 38. Rd4 {...so the rook must retreat...} Ra8 {...and I line up the bishop, and the far right-hand corner...} 39. h4 g6 {...and give my king an escape route...} 40. Bb4 Ra1+ {...allowing the rook to move to the far corner, to attack.} 41. Be1 {My opponent has no option but to block with his bishop, in a position that would not block off my king's escape route...} Rcc1 {...so it's double trouble, as I double my rooks on the top rank.} 42. Re4 {Although he covers the bishop...} Rcxe1+ {...I deem it worth removing it...} 43. Rxe1 {...in exchange for one of my rooks...} Rxe1+ 44. Kxe1 {...before exchanging our remaining rooks, as he only has two pawns left, on his far right-hand side, and my three left-most pawns are still intact, plus I have a stray pawn, on my third right-hand file, on the 5th rank (c4), which is the perfect distraction for the king.} Kg7 45. Kd2 Kf6 46. Kc3 Kf5 47. Kxc4 Kg4 {As there was no way of saving my stray pawn, I go for his...} 48. Kd4 Kxg3 49. Ke4 Kxh4 {...and clear them.} 50. Kf4 g5+ {I push my pawn furthest forward...} 51. Kf3 g4+ {...and again...} 52. Kg2 g3 {...and again, as the king keeps moving backwards.} 53. Kg1 {As his king is on his starting rank...} Kh3 {...I move mine forwards to give my pawn an extra move.} 54. Kh1 {Now with the king in the corner...} g2+ {...I push the pawn again...} 55. Kg1 {...and as the king has to move in front of it...} f5 {...I bring another one up, to avoid a stalemate...} 56. Kf2 {...as the king has to come away...} Kh2 {...and mine can cover the pawn's target square...} 57. Kf3 g1=Q {...allowing me to claim my queen, a reward for making sacrifices at the right time.}
