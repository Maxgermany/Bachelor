1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 5. Nxf7 Bxf2+ 6. Kxf2 Nxe4+ 7. Kg1 Qh4 8. g3 Nxg3 9. hxg3 Qxg3+ 10. Kf1 Rf8 11. Qh5 d5 {I've heard about this move, but don't get it yet. I would have went to Qf4, and  took the bishop on the next move, and set up for Rf7 on the next. We'll see where black is going? ... No wait I see the problem with that, with the king out of f row Nd6 will fork the queen and king via white's queen. ... turns out I think d6 would have been better here. This move is actually completely pointless so far as I can see. (Although in retrospect things work out ok for black.)} 12. Bxd5 {See? Pointless, no?} Nd4 13. Qh2 {That's it, chase that blitch off!} Qg4 14. Qxe5+ {If black had went d4 instead of d5, this would not be an option for white.} Be6 15. Bxe6 Qf3+ 16. Kg1 Ne2+ 17. Kh2 Qf2+ 18. Kh3 Qf3+ 19. Kh4 Qf2+ 20. Kh5 Rxf7 21. Bxf7+ Kxf7 22. Rh2 {Prevents fork.} Qf3+ {Chessnut wrote the next move as ... Kh5 ... but the king is already on that space, so I spose that would be an illegal move. But I was able to figure out it was Kh4 based on the next move. } 23. Kh4 g5+ {See?} 24. Qxg5 Rg8 25. Qh5+ Qxh5+ 26. Kxh5 {Chessnut: Ng3  & Tal drew but...} Nf4+ {a Moscow schoolboy showed that 26...Nf4  mates! } 27. Kh6 Rg6+ 28. Kxh7 Rg7+ 29. Kh6 Kg8 30. Rg2 Rxg2 31. d3 Rg6# {And checkmate! ... Chessnut: World champ Tal missed a mate so what chance do you & I have? I hope this was wild enough.}
