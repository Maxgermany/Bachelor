1. e4 {Although I say it myself, I was quite pleased with my play in this game. I build up the pressure, find an interesting combination to win queen and pawn for rook and bishop and manage to convert the favourable ending.} c5 {Sicilian of course.} 2. Nf3 {Main line again.} Nc6 {Instead of d6.} 3. Be2 {Quite playable, but rather unambitious. 3. d2-d4 is usual.} Nf6 {Attacking e4} 4. Nc3 {He protects.} d5 {Threatening the e pawn again.} 5. exd5 {So he exchanges.} Nxd5 {I take back.} 6. O-O {Castles King-side.} g6 {Intending to fianchetto, as in Pulkkinen, Kari (2316) vs. Kauppila, Osmo (2209) } 7. d4 {I thought this was best for him, but 7. Ne4 was played in the above mentioned game.} cxd4 {So I take.} 8. Nxd4 {He takes back.} Nxc3 {Played to weaken his queen side pawns.} 9. bxc3 {He takes back.} Bg7 {I attack his knight again.} 10. Be3 {He protects it and develops.} O-O {I castle} 11. Nxc6 {He takes.} bxc6 {I take back.} 12. Bd4 {He challenges my strong bishop.} Bf5 {Developing.} 13. Bf3 {Attacking c6} Qc7 {Defending, but also threatening Rf-d8 with a powerful pin.} 14. Bxg7 {He exchanges.} Kxg7 {I recapture.} 15. Qd4+ {He throws in a check. I think simply qe2 is better. Any views dear reader?} e5 {I block.} 16. Qc4 {Attacking, and also offering the c2 pawn.} Rfd8 {I put my trust in development.} 17. Rac1 {This seems a very passive move to me.} Rab8 {So I grab the other open file too.} 18. a4 {I think this is wrong. I was expecting Rf-d1.} Rb2 {Attacking c2 again.} 19. Rfd1 {Contesting the open file.} Rxc2 {I take the offered pawn.} 20. Rxc2 {He takes.} Bxc2 {But his rook goes too.} 21. Rc1 {This again seems wrong, inviting my rook into the heart of his position.} Rd2 {The rook joins the party.} 22. Qxc6 {He gets his pawn back.} Qa5 {Avoiding the queen exchange. I was rather expecting 23. Ra1 next.} 23. Qc4 {OK find black's next move.} Qb6 {Did you find it? Nasty attack on f2 and Rf1? is met with Bd3 winning.} 24. Be2 {Find black's next move again dear reader.} Bd3 {Did you find it? After 25. Bxd3 he is mated, so....} 25. Qxd3 {The queen must go.} Rxd3 {So I take it.} 26. Bxd3 {He takes back.} Qb2 {and the problem for him is that he must lose a pawn too.} 27. Rf1 {Rook goes to safety.} Qxc3 {And a pawn goes.} 28. Bb5 {An interesting end-game has resulted.} e4 {I push a potential passed pawn.} 29. g3 {Preventing my planned f7-f5-f4} Qd2 {Played to try and prevent his rook becoming active.} 30. Rb1 {With thoughts perhaps of becoming active on the b file? } Kf6 {My king advances.} 31. Kf1 {His king centralises.} e3 {Threat mate on f2!} 32. fxe3 {He takes.} Qxe3 {Mistake by me - I should have taken on h2.} 33. Re1 {He hits the queen.} Qf3+ {Check} 34. Kg1 {Threat Rf1.} Kg5 {King up.} 35. Rf1 {Attacking my queen anyway.} Qe3+ {Check} 36. Kg2 {Out of check.} f5 {Pawn up.} 37. h4+ {His turn to check.} Kf6 {I decide to try to advance in the centre of the board.} 38. Rf3 {He attacks my queen.} Qe4 {Pin the rook.} 39. Kf2 {He breaks the pin.} Qc2+ {Check} 40. Kg1 {King back.} Qc5+ {Another check} 41. Kg2 {Out of check.} Qd5 {Another pin.} 42. Kf2 {Out again.} Qd2+ {Check again.} 43.

Re2 {Attacks my queen.} Qd4 {Queen moves.} 48. Kg2 {King moves.} h6 {At last I advance my pawns.} 49. Rf2 {Rook moves.} Qe4+ {Check again.} 50. Rf3 {Rook block. I wanted to play 50......g6-g5 but thought that he could defend with 51. Bd3 so....} Ke5 {King up.} 51. Kf2 {He breaks the pin.} Qc2+ {So check again.} 52. Kg1 {King goes back.} Ke4 {Mine advances.} 53. Rf2 {Hit my queen.} Qd1+ {Check again.} 54. Rf1 {Rook back.} Qd4+ {It is almost as if my queen wants to visit every square.} 55.

Re1+ {Check again.} Kf6 {My king is safe now.} 60. Re2 {His rook is now protected by his bishop.} Qd5+ {Check again.} 61. Kf2 {King moves.} Qh1 {He has to play carefully now to prevent the loss of the g pawn.} 62. Re3 {He protects it.} Qh2+ {Check.} 63. Ke1 {King goes back.} Qg1+ {Yet another check.} 64. Ke2 {King comes up} Qg2+ {and another.} 65. Ke1 {Kng drops back.} f4 {At last my pawn advances again.} 66. gxf4 {He takes.} gxf4 {I take back.} 67. Bf1 {This is a mistake, losing another pawn.} Qc6 {He can't save his a pawn.} 68. Rd3 {So he saves his rook.} Qxa4 {but the pawn goes.} 69. Kf2 {It is lost now.} Ke5 {My king comes up.} 70.
