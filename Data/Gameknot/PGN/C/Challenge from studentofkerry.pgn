1. e4 d5 {I started the Scandinavian Defense here.  I wanted to give it a go, a good test, to see if I can get a good game out of it. } 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. h3 Nf6 4. Nc3 {My queen is being attacked here.  Although it doesn't follow the line exactly, she's being shrewd not to chase my queen all over the board. } Qa5 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. a3 e5 7. d4 Bf5 8. b4 Qb6 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. O-O O-O {Here, I castled.  It's becoming an interesting game.} 11. Re1 Rae8 12. Bxc6 Qxc6 13. Nh4 Qxc3 14. Bg5 Bxc2 15. Qe2 Re6 {A queen fork is scary.  However, this woman has a suitable strategy.  She waits until she can get into a position where she could cause a trade.  Notice, though, that I haven't taken the pawn.  studentofkerry had claimed the file already with her rook. I have challenged her claim and now I'm waiting for the perfect moment to claim the e file for myself.  It has become a waiting game, where one of us could make a mistake.} 16. Rec1 {Here is where studentofkerry made her mistake.  She could have moved her Queen Rook to c1, but she moved her King Rook to c1. it would have been interesting then.  She'd have the e file and would have won the game. } Qb2 17. Qxc2 Qxc2 18. Rxc2 exd4 19. Rxc7 Bxc7 20. f4 Rfe8 21. Nf3 d3 22. Kh2 Re6e2 23. Nd4 Rb2 24. Nf3 Ree2 {Here is where I grabbed the second rank -- the seventh rank to me playing as black.  Studentofkerry is now doomed to lose.} 25. Rg1 Bb6 26. Ne1 Bxg1+ 27. Kxg1 Rxe1+ 28. Kh2 Ree2 29. Kg3 d2 30. a4 d1=Q 31. b5 Rexg2+ 32. Kh4 Rgh2 33. Bxf6 gxf6 34. a5 Qd4 35. a6 Qxf4+ 36. Kh5 Qf3+ 37. Kh4 Qxh3# {Here, we moved to Checkmate.  I feel sorry, of course, but she will continue to play chess and win more games.  I guess you have to lose many games of chess before you attain Grandmaster status. }
