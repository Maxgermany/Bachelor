1. e4 e6 2. d4 c5 {this is actually perfect for this opening} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. c3 d5 5. exd5 exd5 6. Qe2+ Be7 {first question: was this the best move.  my other playable opeions are Ne4 (which is not good at all, in my oppinion) this Qe7 and what I wanted to do second most Be6.} 7. dxc5 Bg4 8. Be3 {? just development? or is something else.} Nc6 9. h3 Bxf3 10. Qxf3 d4 {the next move is a mistake on whites part. (i wanted to push d4 for awhile, but needed more backup.)} 11. cxd4 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 Qxd4 {Xb2, possible mate in the future from an open king, this works on so many levels.  not to mention that, if all else fails, I get free c5} 13. c6 {?!} Qxb2 14. cxb7 Rd8 {as long as the rook is trapped at a1, I might as well not mess with it} 15. Ba6 {Qd2, if only that N wasn't there... } Qxa1 {free rooks = good game for me} 16. O-O Qxa2 17. Qc6+ Nd7 18. Qc8 Qxa6 19. Rc1 O-O 20. Rc7 {this was just error on whites part. thats not any strategy or anything. } Rdxc8 21. bxc8=Q Rxc8 22. Rxc8+ Qxc8 23. Nd2 {now up a queen, a minor and a pawn, this game is over for white. I'm up 13 points, and have taken two queens away from white, leaving him a night and a corner.} Bd6 {possible mate with Qc1#, but I should have done Qc1 for the night. } 24. Nf1 Qc1 25. g3 Nc5 26. Kg2 Qe1 27. Nh2 {? } Ne4 28. Ng4 Nf6 {I missed awesome attack with Nxg3, for mate. with Qh1#} 29. Kh2 Nxg4+ 30. hxg4 Qxf2+ 31. Kh1 Qxg3 32. g5 Qh2# {}
