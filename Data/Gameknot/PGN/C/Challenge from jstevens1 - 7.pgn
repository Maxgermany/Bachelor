1. g3 {1. g3 (a hypermodern opening)} d5 2. Bg2 {2. Bg2 (all very standard - will put pressure on black's centre)} Nf6 3. d4 {3. d4 (strikes out at the centre)} c6 4. Nc3 {4. Nc3 (prepares to play e4 but black has other ideas with Bf5)} Bf5 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Nge2 {6. Nge2 (my kingside is completely developed now I must think about my queenside).} e6 7. f3 {7. f3 (another attempt for e4)} Bd6 8. Bd2 O-O 9. O-O {9. 0-0 (moves 8 and 9 were geared to development)} e5 {9. .......... e5 (a strong move, hitting out at d4 and I unmask a defense battery with my queen).} 10. Be1 a6 11. a3 {11. a3 (counters an expected pawn roll on the queenside)} Re8 12. Bf2 {12. Bf2 shores up my kingside} e4 13. f4 {13. f4 (I go for the solid option but in retrospect I wonder whether I should have exchanged pawns, especially in the light of what was to come many moves down the line!)} Nb6 14. b3 {14. b3 (to stop a knight incursion on c4)} Qd7 {14. ............ Qd7 (a strong move, eyeing up h3 and he does play 15.  Bh3 next move)} 15. Re1 Bh3 16. Qc1 Qg4 17. Qd1 {17. Qd1 (not much I can do to prevent the following exchange of bishops)} Bxg2 18. Kxg2 Qf3+ {18. ......... Qf3  (ooh, nasty nasty!)} 19. Kg1 Ng4 20. Rf1 {20. Rf1 (to defend the bishop on f2 but OMG I think I have overlooked a mate in 3 viz 21. .........Nxh2 - if 22. K x h2  Re6 and I don't think there is any defence to 24 ........ Qh1#), but my opponent plays Re6 at once allowing me to play h4 to close off the h file.} Re6 21. h4 Nxf2 22. Rxf2 {22. R x f2 (black now takes my f2 bishop with his knight - he doesn't seem to notice that my e pawn is now hanging though - maybe he has something better up his sleeve)} Qg4 23. Qf1 {23. Qf1 (after he surprisingly backs off his queen I now organise a kingside defense)} Rh6 24. Rh2 f5 25. Qg2 Nd7 26. Kf1 Nf6 {26. ............. Nf6 (after carefully manoeuvering my pieces to avoid getting checkmated and erecting an apparently solid "joblock" I get a bit of a jolt when he brings his other knight over.  As soon as his queen moves out of the way he is going to plant his knight there, so I move my queen knight over to f2 to prevent this incursion)} 27. Nd1 Qg6 28. Nf2 c5 {28. .......... c5 (I think I have covered everything but this pawn move causes problems, i.e. if I take on c5 then he plays Bxc5 threatening my e pawn.  I could defend with Ktd1 but that would allow the incursion - it comes anyway a few moves later so I wonder, in 20/20 vision hindsight whether it would have been better for me to have gone down this route)} 29. a4 {29. a4 (I move the a pawn out of the range of his dark square bishop)} Rc8 30. Rc1 cxd4 31. exd4 e3 32. Nd1 Re8 33. c3 Qf7 {33. ..... after trying to shore up my queenside he plays 33....... Qf7 to defend his d pawn against Qxd5 )} 34. Rh1 Ng4 35. c4 dxc4 36. bxc4 {36. bxc4 (the dreaded knight incursion has taken place.  It doubly defends his passer on e3 - so I try and make a bid for freedom on the queenside by exchanging pawns - unfortunately it later leads to my detriment)} Ba3 37. Rc3 Bb4 38. Rc2 Re4 39. d5 Qc7 {39.  ......... Qc7 double attack on my c pawn (nasty thing!)} 40. Nb2 Nf2 41. Rh2 Ba3 42. Qf3 {42. Qf3 (I try to complicate things (if 42. ......Rxc4 then Qxe3 threatening his knight on f2 and 43. Qe8 ) but .....} Rb6 43. Nc3 {43. Nc3 (in response to this rook move I try to complicate things by attacking his e4 rook, unfortunately this does not work)} Rxb2 44. Nxe4 Rxc2 45. Nxf2 Qxc4+ {45. ............ Qxc4  (after this move my position well and truly falls apart and two moves later after a vicious bishop/rook cross pin I wave the white flag).  At least this game has lasted longer than the other completed games, that is all I can say.} 46. Kg1 exf2+ 47. Rxf2 Bc5 {}
