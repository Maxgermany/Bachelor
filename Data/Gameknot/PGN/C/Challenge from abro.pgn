Bxc6 dxc6 7. dxe5 {Knight has two good moves, more popular is Nf5 but Ne4 is said "!?" interesing, so lets check it out ...} Ne4 8. Qe2 {White could exchange queens but people say it is unnecessary when N is on e4 ...} Nc5 {8. ... Bf5 was the main move, but white can lock the knight ...} 9. Be3 Be7 10. Rd1 Bd7 11. b4 {Ah!
