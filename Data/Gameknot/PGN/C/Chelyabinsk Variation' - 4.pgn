1. e4 {Another short game taken from a Chelyabinsk Variation tournament} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {This is the tournament starting position} 6. Ndb5 {This seems a good outpost for the knight as it threatens to cause problems on d6 or c7} d6 7. Nd5 {Now he can either lose a rook to a fork, or exchange knights and then be forced to move his remaining knight} Nxd5 8. exd5 Ne7 {pressuing the d pawn but notice that his king is now almost completely surrounded} 9. c4 {reinforces the d pawn, but more importantly opens the diagonal to a4 for my queen. I'm not sure if c3 would be better as that leaves my lsb with a better run should it be needed} a6 {Although this attempts to move the knight I think it should have been done earlier (before I moved my c pawn). } 10. Qa4 {Should he take the knight he will clearly lose the rook, however this could save the game for black. If he cannot open some space around the king I have Nd6} Ng6 {Possibly the best move in the circumstances. I looked at this position for a while and wasn't clear if Nc7 or Nxd6 is the better move.} 11. Nc7+ {This at least would gain me a rook.  Black resigned. Interestingly we are still within the Gameknot Database here.}
