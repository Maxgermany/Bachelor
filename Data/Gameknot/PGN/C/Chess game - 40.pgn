1. e4 c5 {always...} 2. Bc4 {here we go again: no clue...} g6 {always...} 3. Nc3 a6 {Najdorfs' extension: always, after Nc3; d6 is also an option, but we need the d-pawn for later...} 4. a4 {u tell me...} Bg7 {always...} 5. Nf3 e6 {always...} 6. d3 {why not d4?} Ne7 {always...} 7. O-O O-O 8. Bg5 {a minor distraction...} f6 9. Be3 {that would have been a sound move: in an earlier life...} d5 {always d5...} 10. exd5 exd5 11. Bb3 {making d5-d4 a lethal move...} Kh8 {so we first need this...} 12. Bxc5 Qc7 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 14. Nxd5 Qc5 {not discouraged at all...} 15. h3 Be6 {pushing Nd5...} 16. d4 {a bit too late...} Qc6 17. Nc7 Bxb3 {fearless...} 18. Nxa8 {idiot: this Knight will never survive...} Bxc2 19. Qd2 Be4 {setting up, multiple targets...} 20. Rac1 Qd5 21. Qe3 b5 {after Nb6/Nc7, Qb7...} 22. Nc7 Qb7 {like so...} 23. axb5 Bxf3 24. Qxf3 Qxf3 {like planned...} 25. g3 {a sudden end of the game: what is this? a mouse slip? a resignation? a cunning plan, to foil Black? we will never know: White resigned...}
