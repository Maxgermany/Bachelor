[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 {Very solid and very popular. In the opening few moves, aim to establish a strong presence in the center of the board. Think of d4, d5, e4, and e5 as a big hill in the middle of a battlefield. Any general will tell you that it is imperative to control the "high ground".} d5 {Scandanavian Defense. Black intends to rip open the center immediately and claim it for himself.} 2. Nc3 {?! Not neccessarily a bad move, just a little passive. White generally has a better game if he plays 2. exd or 2. e5. The risk of this knight move is that black can claim more space and attack the white Nc3 if he plays 2...d4.} dxe4 {Black opts to remove the pawn presence in the middle of the board, with hopes of getting both of his knights and both bishops developed quickly and exerting influence over those now vacated squares.} 3. Nxe4 {White maintains material equality, however this knight is now on an awkward square and can be attacked.} Bf5 {Black safely develops a piece with "tempo". I won't go into a lengthy discussion on "tempo". If you don't understand that concept just message me.} 4. Bd3 {? Very suspect move. That is an awful square for white's light squared bishop, as it restricts the development of the other bishop AND blocks the d2 pawn from advancing.} e6 {Black now has safe squares for all of his pieces to develop to.} 5. Nf3 {Not bad.....white can now castle. But think about this........Look at the board. White has 3 pieces developed, black has only 1. White should win the race to get pieces developed, right? Not neccessarily, as black can safely get his pieces out in numerous, immediate ways. White must waste "time" (another concept to learn) to deal with the problems caused by 4. Bd3.} Ne7 {Obviously not where this knight will reside for any length of time. Black probably intends to move it again on the next move, as it will get another gun into the fight for the center.} 6. O-O {Logical. Since the king is now safely tucked away, white MUST get developed on the queenside.} Nd5 {Black stays true to form, and will strictly develop over the next few moves.} 7. Qe2 {?! Again - not bad, just passive. White MUST address the problems of the d pawn and the the dark squared bishop.} Nd7 {Black accelerates development knowing he can catch up rapidly and be the instigator of the the first attacking sequence of the game.} 8. Bc4 {! Nice. White finally realizes his weakness and deals with it in a strong manner.} Be7 {Preparing 0-0.} 9. d4 {This move is a coin flip with 9. d3.  As played, white claims space in center - but the d pawn must be protected. 9.d3 is more conservative, as the dark squared bishop still gets out but the d pawn is already protected by the c pawn.} O-O {As planned.} 10. Bd2 {Safe and solid development. Check out the possibility of 10.Bg5 if you are the attacking style of player.} a6 {?! Somewhat limited options exist for piece placement, so black shores up his queenside defense.} 11. c3 {Not too sure about this move. As it protects the d pawn, the Nf3 is free to roam now - which is good. The down side is that it just closed in the dark squared bishop behind it's own pawns. That makes white's dark squared bishop potentially "bad". Again, if you are not familiar with the concept of the "bad bishop" just let me know. Basically, it just a bishop restricted behind it's own pawns.} b5 {Black lurches forward on the queenside with tempo gained from the attack on the Bc4.} 12. Bxd5 {?! Let's examine this position for a moment. White was basically given three options for that last move. A good move (Bd3), an weak move (Bb3), and a violent move (BxN). Yes, there are times when a "good" move is not enough, and you must shake things up with an exchange. However, I don't believe this to be one of those times. By making this move, white has just ceded the bishop pair (yet another concept to understand) to black. With all of the space available on the board that both black bishops have, white has just given black a distinct advantage.} exd5 {Black happily equalizes.} 13. Neg5 {An interesting choice. The Ng5 is doubly protected on a strong square, yet it has no immediate threats. Perhaps Ng3 threatening the Bf5 was better. It certainly would have been more aggressive.} Re8 {Black sees that the enemy knight on g5 poses no danger, and could easily be repelled by playing h6. Black sees the chance to get a rook to an open file, where a hopeful discovered attack on the white queen can be executed.} 14. Rfe1 {! Strong move. White reinforces the weak e file. I hope you saw 14...BxN 15. QxR  QxQ 16. RxQ  RxR 17. NxB before you played 14. Rfe1.} h6 {Black seizes the chance to force the Ng5 to retreat to h3, where it becomes a tasty target.} 15. Nxf7 {Unsound because f7 cannot be safely attacked once the sac is accepted. } Kxf7 {Black snags the piece, and now eyes the f file as the quickest avenue of attack for his rooks.} 16. Ne5+ {! Very strong. Black has to capture or face the ugly 17. Nc6.} Nxe5 {Black accepts the challenge.} 17. Qh5+ {? Why turn down the free material?  17. QxN  with an additional attack on the Bf5 was much, much stronger. Also, 17. Qh5  is nothing more than a nuisance.................} Bg6 {............as it is easily blocked with tempo. It is worth noting that this tempo prevents the immediate f4!, which would be strong.} 18. Qxe5 {White now picks up the knight. The problem with his delayed capture of this knight is.....................} Bf6 {! Black still gets the discovered attack on the enemy queen (now two times!), and the exchange theme mentioned on move 14 is still alive. If it is carried out, black will have a nice advantage in the endgame.} 19. Qf4 {! Strong. White sets a very pretty pin, and any exchange on the e file will result in him owning it.} Rxe1+ {While not strictly forced, black decides to go ahead and push his material advantage towards a fast endgame.} 20. Rxe1 {Of course.} Kg8 {! Black not only breaks the pin on his king, he also manuevers towards a nice little shelter behind his g and h pawns.} 21. Qg4 {White attacks the most obvious target on the board - the unprotected Bg6.} Kh7 {! The black king finds the perfect home. It is now 1) the protector of his light squared bishop, 2) in no danger from any immediate or even short term threat, and most importantly 3) residing on the opposite colored square than the enemy bishop. Black intends to offer up a queen exchange as soon as possible to exploit this weakness.} 22. h3 {? No idea what this move is all about. It threatens nothing and defends nothing. White has now returned some time to black.} Qc8 {Here is what black was hoping for. He wants to exchange queens immediately anywhere, then play Re8 to either exchange the rooks as well or to claim dominance on the e file.} 23. Qe2 {?! White understands the old rule about avoiding exchanges when down in material, and wisely retreats.  He just retreated to the wrong square though. 23. Qd1 was the play.} Qe8 {Black attempts once again to eliminate the queens.} 24. g4 {Definitely aggressive. Getting the f pawn to f5 would most definetly validate it.} Qxe2 {Black finally gets to dictate the terms for a bit, and presses on with the plan.} 25. Rxe2 {Obviously forced.} Re8 {Black now aims to exchange rooks on e8.} 26. Rxe8 {Yet again this move was practically forced, as 26. Re1 still leads to the rooks being exchanged.} Bxe8 {Just as planned.} 27. f4 {! Strong. White can now totally clamp down on the light squares around the enemy king if he can play f5.} g5 {Black sees the weakness of the white squares, and goes ahead and locks down the dark squares for himself. Having the extra bishop should easily nullify the pawn disadvantage he has on the kingside. } 28. fxg5 {? 28. f5 was better,  as this move both encourages material exchange (bad for white) as well as liberates black's dark squared bishop. Think about it....if 28. f5 black's dark squared bishop is hemmed in.} Bxg5 {Black presses ahead yet again to get material off of the board. If this offer is accepted, black will aim to blockade the enemy g and h with his bishop while the king goes pawn hunting on the queenside.} 29. Bxg5 {As the wheels had already been set in motion, white tries to capitalize on his kingside pawn advantage. He will need to rush his king straight ahead for escort duty. His game depends on getting one of those pawns promoted.} hxg5 {Of course.} 30. Kg2 {White (and black too, for that matter) needs  to notice the e and f files. Due to the pawn structure, neither side can advance throught this area.} Kg6 {Black protects his isolated pawn.} 31. Kg3 {White prepares to play h4.} Kf6 {Black knows he can block the enemy pawns from advancing with his bishop if need be, and makes a waiting move. The king may be needed to deflect his counterpart after 32. h4 gxh4  33. Kxh.} 32. h4 {As he is already committed, white will atempt to press his g pawn.} gxh4+ {Forced, as black CANNOT allow a passed pawn under any circumstance.} 33. Kxh4 {White will now attempt to escort the g pawn to promotion.} Ke6 {This move serves as more of a decoy than anything else. Black understands that the white g pawn must be either eliminated or sufficiently blockaded  before he can start pursuing enemy pawns.} 34. Kg5 {Logical, as it restricts the black king from f6.} Bf7 {Yet another waiting move. Eventually, white will run out of moves, and be forced to start retreating.} 35. Kh6 {White makes one last valiant effort to support the g pawn's advance. It is worth noting that this attempt is poorly timed however, as black controls the candidate queening square.} Kf6 {Black can now safely withstand a check to start dictating terms to the white king.} 36. g5+ {White's last desperate hope........} Kf5 {The problem of the g pawn is now solved. Black can now freely start eliminating white pawns. White decides to resign at this point. Good game prosperov2 :) I hope this will help you! - Thomas}
