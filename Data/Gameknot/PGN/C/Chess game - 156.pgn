1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch game.} exd4 4. Bc4 Bc5 5. O-O d6 6. Re1 Nf6 7. c3 dxc3 8. Nxc3 {The Scotch gambit. I had never seen white( a person who I know) play this. I believe that white has very little compensation for his sacrificed pawn at the moment.} O-O 9. Bg5 Bg4 10. h3 Bh5 11. Nd5 {White will double my pawns.} Nd4 12. Be2 Nxf3+ 13. Bxf3 Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Bd4 {Here I'm just a solid pawn up.} 15. Rad1 {He sacrifices yet another pawn for no reason.} Bxb2 16. Qg3 {The immediate threat is Bh6 winning the exchange at least and damaging blacks pawn structure if I lose my DSB. This also prepare f4? } Re8 17. Bh6 Nh5 {Simulataneous attacks the queen and there are now two additional protectors of g7.} 18. Qg4 g6 {MY dark squares are extremely weak now.} 19. f4 c6 {The knight would've been annoying on f6. This forces the knight to move and white will lose a pawn or the exchange.} 20. Ne3 Rxe4 {Nb4 would've been met by Bc3 winning the knight or the exchange. White is going nowhere right now.} 21. Nf5 {I see what white is trying to do here.} Rxe1+ 22. Rxe1 Qb6+ 23. Kh1 Rd8 24. Qg5 Qf2 25. Rb1 Bf6 {Attacks the queen.} 26. Qg4 Kh8 {Capturign the knight on f5 is no threat. White would actually benefit if I did. He would probably grab a pawn on f5.} 27. Rb4 {Protecting f4. } gxf5 {I risk a bad position to get rid of a key defender of d4.} 28. Qxh5 Bd4 29. Kh2 Rg8 {I know hit white with everything I've got.} 30. Bg5 Qg1+ 31. Kg3 Qe1+ 32. Kh2 {The only available square unless white wants to get mated.} Qxb4 {I just grab the rook for free. White's attacks are running dry.} 33. h4 d5 {Making use of the dark square diagonal.} 34. Qh6 Bg7 {I had calculated something along the lines of this where white tries to force a perpetual if I exchange DSB's.} 35. Bf6 Qc4 {A "High class" waiting move.} 36. h5 d4 37. Qg5 h6 {h6 was a serious threat. I'm not sure how I even got into this position.} 38. Bxg7+ Rxg7 39. Qxh6+ Kg8 {White is out of checks and just resigns here. 1st place has 4/7 points. I have 3/7}
