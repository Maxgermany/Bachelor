1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. cxd5 Qxd5 {Huh.... I don't think this is great as I can chase it.} 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Bd2 Bxc3 6. Bxc3 Nf6 7. Nf3 Ne4 {Maybe not great... You're usually not supposed to move the same piece twice in the opening.} 8. e3 O-O 9. Bd3 {I finish minor piece development. White is ahead in development, but blacks pieces are more active.} Nxf2 {? Not worth the knight if you as me.} 10. Kxf2 b6 11. Qa4 Bd7 12. Qa3 a5 13. Rac1 {Grabbing the half open file.} Nc6 14. b3 {Blocking off the queen. There are actually only three safe squares for his queen.} f6 15. h3 f5 16. g3 b5 17. Qb2 {White is ahead in material, but passive.} e5 18. Nxe5 {?? Loses the knight.} Nxe5 19. dxe5 Qxd3 {And now, after that blunder we are tied in material, but I'm not as passive.} 20. e6 {Maybe better would be Rhd1} Bxe6 21. Bxg7 Rf7 22.

Ke2 {Now I'm down by five and my only hope is that my queen and bishop are threatening checkmate and it will be hard for him to defend.} Qg2+ 29. Ke1 Qxg3+ 30. Kd2 Qg2+ {He finally gets his queen in position to defend against the mate threat.} 31. Kd3 f4 32. h4 Qe4+ 33. Ke2 Qxe3+ 34. Kf1 Bg2+ {I'm not sure this is sound.} 35. Kxg2 Qg3+ 36. Kf1 f3 {Here I couldn't see a way to win, so I decided to get a draw.} 37. Qe6+ Kh8 38. Qf6+ Kg8 39. Qe6+ Kh8 40. Qf6+ Kg8 41. Qe6+ Kh8 {}
