[Opening "Danish gambit (C21), Collijn defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 cxb2 5. Bxb2 {The Danish gambit accepted! An opening which I use on a regular basis. Although it gives two extra pawns to black, it is quite difficult for black to defend against whites extremely mobile pieces.} Nc6 {This is not a standard line as far as I know. My opponent takes the game out of the opening books. I had to use my aggressive instincts to stay put.} 6. Nf3 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 Nge7 {Perhaps Nf6 followed by the plan of Ne4 is better!} 8. O-O O-O 9. Nd5 Nxd5 10. Qxd5 {My attack starts building up!} Be7 11. Rad1 {...With the idea of pinning the d pawn after my queen moves out of the d-file.} d6 12. Qh5 {Keeping the queen in close proximity to the black king.} Bd7 13. Rfe1 {Seeing that I'd have to make up my position before beginning the assault!} Qc8 {This,in my view, is the first great error of my opoonent. It allows me to attack instantly.} 14. Ng5 Bxg5 {Almost forced!} 15. Qxg5 Ne5 {A good attempt for defense.} 16. f4 {maybe h6 might have saved the game.} Ng6 17. f5 Ne5 18. Bxe5 {Now I destroy the knight which is the last defense of the king against the f-pawns advance!} dxe5 19. f6 {The decisive advance!} g6 {There is no other defense! } 20. Qh6 {Here my opoonent resigned because there is no defense for Qg7#. A good game. This is why I love the Danish gambit!}
