1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {a standard reaction against the Philidor: Black cannot allow dxe5...} exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Be7 6. Bd3 {serving multiple purposes...} a6 7. O-O b5 8. f4 {no fear, for b5-b4: we take over the center...} O-O 9. Be3 c5 10. Nf5 Bxf5 11. exf5 Qd7 {hard to follow: Black had several better moves...} 12. g4 {a bit brisky, for the White King: but it works...} Nc6 {finishing development: apart from solving the threat of Be4...} 13. g5 Ne8 {only move...} 14. Nd5 c4 15. Be2 {White has done enough damage: this is stronger than Be4...} Bd8 {Black acknowledges the problem: Nxe7+ wins another tempo, and pawn f5 is invulnerable; because Whites' next move, will always be Bg4...} 16. Bg4 {covering f5...} f6 17. h4 {logical move...} Nc7 18. gxf6 {after Nxd5, Qxd5+...} Bxf6 19. Nxc7 {displacing the Black Queen...} Qxc7 20. Qd5+ Kh8 {also here, there were better solutions...} 21. h5 {here Black resigned: White is about to rip open the Black Kings' wing...}
