1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {the petroff defence has had a bit of a renosainnce of late. It is a good defensive choice because black usaully has not trouble equalizing. } 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nc4 Nc6 {too passive ??  play 4. ...Nxe4 to recapture the pawn would make more sense. } 5. d3 {because black played 4. ...Nc6 white is allowed to build a solid centre. Also black's position not very dynamic at all and is feeling very cramped. } Be6 {very logical and good. } 6. Nc3 b5 {?? absoluately suicidal better is: 6. ...BxN 7. PxN Na5 and black's problems are solved} 7. Nxb5 a6 8. Nc3 d5 {?? too aggressive better is: 8. ...BxN 9. PxB QxQ 10. NxQ(10.

Ne3 Qa5+ {11. ...Qe7 better to move the queen back to safety  } 12. Bd2 Qd5 {oops!!} 13. Nxd5 Bxd5 14. c4 Be6 15. Qf3 Bd7 16. Bc3 {nice move that indirectly pins the dark bishop to the defence of g7} Rb8 17. Qe4+ Be7 18. Be2 g6 {omg I can't believe that you played this move???  18. ...0-0} 19. Bxh8 Be6 20. Qxc6+ Kf8 21. Qxc7 Rc8 22. Qa5 f6 23. Qxa6 Re8 {?? 23. ...Kf7 at least wins the bishop} 24. a3 Bf5 25. Bxf6 Bxf6 26. Qxf6+ Kg8 27. Kd2 Rf8 28. Qd4 Be6 29. Bf3 Rf7 30. Qd8+ Kg7 31. Qd4+ Kf8 32. Qd6+ Kg7 33.
