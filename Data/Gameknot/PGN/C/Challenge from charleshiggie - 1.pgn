[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed, 2...Nc6"]

1. e4 {This is a very short game, with white rather surprisingly getting mated!} c5 {So it starts as a Sicilian Defence.} 2. Nc3 {This seems to indicate the closed variations.} Nc6 {I reply in kind.} 3. Nf3 {White develops her other knight.} d6 {I keep my options open.} 4. d4 {And white transposes now into the Open Sicilian.} cxd4 {So I take.} 5. Nxd4 {She takes back.} Nf6 {I continue to develop, with the main line.} 6. Bg5 {She continues with the Richter-Rauzer Attack, probably the strongest line for white.} e6 {And this is the most common reply, although other moves are quite playable.} 7. Bb5 {This is a bit unusual. 7. Qd2 and 8. 0-0-0 is more common.} Bd7 {I have to defend against the double attack on Nc6} 8. O-O {She castles to safety.} Be7 {I develop. All this has been seen before.} 9. Re1 {Normal development.} O-O {I castle too.} 10. Nxc6 {Although it has been played before, I don't like this move for white. It is not the sort of move I would ever play as white. After the recapture with the pawn, Black's pawn centre is strengthened.} bxc6 {Not only that I am now attacking the bishop.} 11. Bd3 {Which drops back.} e5 {This seems a sensible move, stopping e4-e5. Normally in the Open Sicilian, this moves leaves a weakness on the d5 square, but here, thanks to white exchanging on c6, there is no weakness, and black can plan to play d6-d5 with a very strong centre.} 12. f4 {This is the first move that has not been in either of the databases. It is a normal attacking move for white in the Open Sicilian, but here there are problems. OK stop and consider what you would play as black?} Ng4 {Is that the move you would play? Initially I looked at 12. Qb6+ forking the king on g1 and the pawn on b2, but then I wondered if this was even strong. There are many threats for white to deal with.} 13. Bxe7 {White doesn't seem to understand the threat.} Qb6+ {Black is now mating white. http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=167004  Many thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed this.
