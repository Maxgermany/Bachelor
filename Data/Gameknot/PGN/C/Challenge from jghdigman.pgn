1. c4 {This was a game with not a lot of pieces from the beginning.} e5 {I began with c4 and black responded with e5.} 2. g3 Bc5 {I then went with g3 to allow my bishop to fianchetto and black developed his bishop to c5.} 3. e3 d6 {I moved a pawn out to e3 and black's move was pawn to d6 supporting his e5 pawn.  My e3 pawn provides more defence from the DB at e5.} 4. Nc3 c6 {I now develop my b knight to c3 and black moves pawn to c6.} 5. Bg2 h5 {I now fianchetto my LB to g2 and black moves his pawn to h5.} 6. h4 Nf6 {I reciprocate with h4 stopping the h pawn from coming down the h file.} 7. Nge2 Bg4 {I now develop my g knight to e2 and black develops his LB to g4.  We are now both ready to castle.} 8. Qb3 { } b6 {I move my queen to b3 to support the c4 pawn and black moves pawn to b6.} 9. d4 exd4 {I push my d pawn out to d4 and black captures with his e5 pawn.} 10. exd4 Bxd4 {I recapture with my e3 pawn and black recaptures with his DB.} 11. O-O Bxe2 {I now castle and black brings his LB to e2 attacking my rook.} 12. Nxe2 Bc5 {I capture the LB with my c3 knight.  Black moves his DB to c5 out of the e2 knight's reach.} 13. Be3 Bxe3 {I bring my DB to e3 attacking black's DB as he cannot evade capture so he will probably exchange and I can retake with my queen.} 14. Qxe3+ Qe7 {I take the DB with my queen and black brings his queen in front of his King as my queen was checking the king when I took the DB.} 15. Qg5 g6 {I do not wish to exchange queens right now as neither of us have a lot of pieces.  Black has a pair of knights and I have one of each.  So I move my queen to g5 and black pushes his pawn to g6.} 16. Rfe1 Ne4 {I move my rook f1 to e1 opposite the king but behind my e2 knight and black moves his knight to e4.} 17. Qe3 f5 {I move my queen down to e3 on the same file as black's king and black's queen also pinning black's knight at e4.  Black moves down his f7 pawn to f5.} 18. Qd4 Rf8 {I bring my queen to d4 attacking black's h8 rook.  Black moves h8 rook to f8.} 19. Nf4 Qf6 {I move my e2 knight to f4 and black moves the queen out of the pin to f6.  However black's e4 knight is still pinned to the king by the rook at e1.} 20. Bxe4 Qxd4 {I am not proud of my next move as I seem to have forgotten I have a pin and I decide to take the e4 knight with my LB and allow black's queen to capture my queen at d4.  The problem was that with black's queen at f6 and 3 pawns on the 6 row at b6, c6 and d6, it was difficult to find another move and I must have missed! the queen capture.  Of course my best move may have been to exchange queens at least I would have been in a better position than I am.  Also black has a pawn at f5 which can recapture my LB.  A bit of a mess I would say.} 21. Bxc6+ Kd8 {I was able to move my LB away to c6 and check the king so my LB was safe for now although I don't know why black didn't capture my LB with his undeveloped b8 knight.  Black's king moves out of check to d8.} 22. Ne6+ Kc8 {So I am able to recheck the king at e6 with my F knight.  This move also forks the queen.  King moves out of check again.} 23. Nxd4 Nxc6 {I now capture the queen at d4 with my E knight and black captures my LB with his B knight.  Black is attacking my knight at d4 with his c6 knight.} 24. Nxc6 Kc7 {I capture black's d6 knight and king moves to c7 attacking my c6 knight.} 25. Nd4 a6 {We are now in the end game and I have an extra piece, a knight, otherwise all even.  I move my knight out of the king's grasp to d4 and black brings his pawn out to a6.} 26. Ne6+ Kc6 {I move my knight back up e6 checking the king who moves to c6.} 27. Rac1 Rf6 {I move my A rook across to c1 opposite the king and protecting my pawn at c4.  Black brings his F rook to f6 attacking my knight at e6 but this is protected by my e1 rook.} 28. f4 b5 {I push my f2 pawn to f4 stopping the black pawn's progress on the f file.  Black pushes his pawn to b5 attacking my pawn at c4.} 29. Nd4+ Kc5 {I check the king with my knight at d4 which moves to c5.  The king could capture my knight as it is not protected.} 30. Red1 Re8 {So I bring my e1 rook across to d1 to protect my knight.  Black now brings his a8 rook to e8 and takes control of the open file.} 31. b4+ Kb6 {I push my b2 pawn to b4 checking the king who moves over to b6.} 32. c5+ dxc5 {I push my c4 pawn to c5 again checking the king and it is captured by pawn at d6.} 33. bxc5+ Ka5 {I recapture with b4 pawn and check the king again who now moves to a5.  My c5 pawn is now has a clear path to queen and is protected by my rook at c1.  However there are 2 rooks at f6 and e8 which could capture this pawn.} 34. Kh2 Re3 {I move my king over to h2 to avoid black's rook coming down to check it but if it were to land on e2 and check the king it would be captured by my knight at d4 so instead the rook comes down to e3.} 35. c6 Rf8 {I continue to try to push my pawn up to c6 and black moves his f6 rook to f8.} 36. Rc5 Rc8 {I move my C rook to c5 it allows me to move onto another file if I want to as my rook at d1 was restricting the rook's movement.  Black moves his f8 rook over to c8 stopping my queening intentions.} 37. Nb3+ Kb4 {I recheck the king with my knight at b3 and the king moves out of check to b4.  The knight is protected by my a2 pawn and my c5 rook is protected by my knight.} 38. Re5 Rxe5 {I decide to exchange the e3 rook and my c5 rook.  I move my c rook across to e5 and black captures with his e3 rook.  However the e5 square is protected by my pawn at f4.} 39. fxe5 Rxc6 {I capture the rook at e5 with my pawn and black captures my passed pawn at c6.} 40. Rd2 Re6 {Now I move my rook to d2 which prevents black's rook from coming down  to c2 to check the king.  So black moves his rook to e6 to attack my other passed pawn at e5.} 41. Re2 a5 {I move my rook over to protect my pawn at e5 and black moves his pawn to a5.} 42. Nd4 Rc6 {I now move my knight to d4 and attack the rook at e6 which moves to c6.  The rook is now in my grasp but my opponent was probably thinking he could gain access down this file to my king and forgot he was still at risk on that square.} 43. Nxc6+ {I capture the rook and my opponent resigns.}
