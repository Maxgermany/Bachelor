[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {A somewhat unusual king's pawn opening. White starts by attacking the classical weak spot f7 by his bishop} Nf6 {2...Nf6 is a very good aggressive response, in fact "by the book". It attacks the white centre pawn, develops the knight and helps to ready for short castling, all in one move!} 3. Nh3 {This is a very bad move that instantly brings the position into black's favour. Unless there is a good reason, a knight should much rather occupy a centre square, not one on the sideline where it covers far less squares} Bc5 {Again, an excellent move by black, now putting the weak f2 square under attack. Of course, black failed to make the probably best move here, namely 3...Nxe4 taking white's unprotected centre pawn. But still good.} 4. Ng5 {A bold and agressive move by white, not bad at all, doubling the threat at f7.} O-O {Black's reply (0-0) is clearly the best move here, elegantly avoiding the threat and developing at the same time by the castling. } 5. Bxf7+ {This sacrifice yields nothing after the correct reply, which would have been 5...Rxf7 6. Nxf7 Kxf7, where black takes two pieces (knight and bishop) for a rook and a pawn, except material loss for white. However.... } Kh8 {black moves the king instead. By this move black loses material (the pawn) and much (most) of their advantage already gained. Yet, the positions are roughly equal now} 6. Nc3 {Castling had been stronger here} Nd5 {6....Nd5?? is a very bad move. The knight is unprotected at d5 and threatened by three pieces. Sure, the move opens up the line from the black queen to the unprotected white knight at g5, but what if white had replied 7. d4! Now black has TWO pieces threatened and undefended, and at the same time the g5 knight is now protected!} 7. Nxd5 {Instead white takes the offered knight} Qxg5 {and black takes the g5 knight, but white has now the better position} 8. h4 {Unfortunately for white, this move not only loses all that advantage (the best move had been 8. 0-0), but is also a serious blunder that is immediately taken advantage of by black} Qxg2 {Now white is in serious trouble.} 9. Rf1 {The best move, but with correct play by black the game is won} Rxf7 {Well played by black who is now up in material by 3 "points" and has excellent attacking chances} 10. Ne3 {A good move by white} Qxe4 {followed by logical play by black (Bxe3 had been good as well)} 11. Qh5 {White's tries to fight back ("attack is the best defense")} Rf8 {g6 or Bxe3 had been better. When a player has a material advantage it is often worth the while to do exchanges} 12. Rg1 g6 13. Qh6 d5 {A good move, but what about 13....Rf5!} 14. b4 Bxb4 15. Bb2 Nc6 16. O-O-O Nd4 {What about 16.....Rxf2 } 17. Ng4 {However, white blunders with Ng4 and overlooks black's very strong attack} Qxc2# {A very good game, and congratulations to black for the win }
