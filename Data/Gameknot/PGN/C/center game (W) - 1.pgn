1. e4 e5 2. d4 {Center game} Nc6 {Black doesn't take} 3. Nf3 exd4 4. c3 {White doesn't take either} dxc3 5. Nxc3 {I like this variation. White is one pawn down but has 3 pieces out against one for black.} Bb4 {Common move} 6. Bc4 {the most agresxsive answer} Nf6 7. O-O {to unpine the c knight.} O-O {Both kings in safe. Now white's plan is to take control of the center.} 8. Nd5 {agressive move} Nxe4 {Now white is 2 pawns down but has very strong attacking possibilities } 9. a3 {Off !} Bc5 10. Qc2 {To fire the only piece black has on the center.} Nxf2 {Mistake.} 11. Rxf2 {Now black has 6 pieces out against 2 for black. Black will soon be ahead again in material but, to achieve this result, will have to give most of the pieces he had out.} Bxf2+ 12. Kxf2 {I can be wrong but I think that black is doomed.} Na5 {Mistake, black has to develop instead of carring on playing the same pieces. Furthermore, the knight is now on the queen side where he can not get very dangerous.} 13. Bg5 {To free the white rook and take the black queen. (if 13. ... f6 14. Ne7+ Kh8 15. Ng6+ hxg6 16. Bxd8 taking the queen ; if 13. ... Qe8 14. Re1 and the queen is lost as well).} Nxc4 {As he cannot save his queen black tries a counterattack but it's another mistake. Black trades the only piece he has out (the LSB was dangerous for black at this spot but the queen will take and play exactly the same role)...} 14. Bxd8 {First taking the queen} Rxd8 {Black had little othe choices} 15. Qxc4 {Now white is up in material and has a far better position.} c6 {Black fights untill the end.} 16. Ne7+ {Not letting black any pause.} Kh8 17. Qh4 {Menacing 18. Ng6+ fxg6 19. Qxd8 +} Rf8 18. Ng5 {menacing 19. Qxh7 mate} h6 19. Qh5 {The rope tights around the neck.} d5 {Black has little other choice} 20. Nxf7+ {black will lose a rook.} Rxf7+ 21. Qxf7 Bg4 22. Re1 {Black submits here.}
