1. e4 {Same routine King Pawn 2} e5 {He has mirrored.  I quite like that. } 2. Nc3 {Protect my pawn. Ng6?} c5 {That is so he can bring his Knight out off b8 without trapping c7 pawn (He told me last time we played).} 3. Nf3 {So Knight out..  Next Nc6!! } Nc6 {Told you.} 4. Bc4 {Bishop attacks f7 and enables castling option.} h6 {Brother Dardon and I play all the time he always thinks I am after his rook.  I am guessing this is to stop my knight moving to g5 threatening the fork on f7.} 5. a3 {This will be no surprise to him.  He knows I do this for the extra space for my bishop on a2 whilst preventing Nb4. } Nf6 {The trouble you get when you talk about your games is the player you talk to starts to understand your way of thinking.  I thought h6 was to protect my knight going for the fork (as he told me was a concern previously).  But instead it is to prevent......} 6. d3 {.......me going to g5 with my bishop and taking his knight after this move    ( as I told him due to my liking for the d5 square attacked with knight on f6)} d6 {Strengthening the two pawns this also opens up his white squared bishops diagonal.} 7. Nd5 {Not liking his knight protecting this square I offer knight for knight.  I am sure he knows I want it but will he accept?} Be6 {After our previous discussion he chooses to refuse the knight exchange.  I do not like this move as It may harm my pawn structure in the event of exchanges.} 8. Nxf6+ {I decide to at least take his knight.  I am not sure if he wants knight or bishop and I preferably do not want to exchange both of them. } Qxf6 {Got my knight.  This attacks my king side of the board in the event of me castling.  Clears the path for his queenside castling.  Backs up his bishop If I decide to exchange, keeping his pawn structure in tact.} 9. Bd2 {Because of the attack on my king side and the strength of his defence king side. I am going to open up the possibility of queen side castling. Bd2 protects king here for now and keeps diagonal options open.} Qd8 {Strange move.  Cant see what it acheives.  Perhaps wants to bring out his bishop for king side castle without making queen vulnerable.} 10. Bxe6 {Originally I didn't want bishop for bishop but this will open up his king slightly and tie up f7 pawn doubling it up with e5 pawn.  } fxe6 {now e6 pawn is weak and king is open for Qh5 attack.} 11. h3 {I have opened this to give my knight a place to moveand an escape for my king after castling.  Not sure if g3 would have been better giving me h4 for knight.  I chose this as a personal preference in kings escapes during endgames.  } d5 {If he wants the pawn exchange he will have to take it himself.  d4 looks a better option for him.  I cant really understand this move.} 12. Nh2 {I think 11.g3 would have been better now. I really don't like my position here but now I am intending to attack his king with my queen and/or creating a defence for a now king side castle.  } Rg8 {This is obviously to push his g7 pawn up possibly in defence on an attack on h5 with my queen which is now pointless. } 13. Ng4 {So now I will bring back out my knight attacking e5, h6 and possibly in the future f6 forking rook and king (longshot). If he advances h5 though I may have to retreat back.} Qd7 {Queen-side castle? Can i capture h6 pawn for free.  I will have a think about the dangers. } 14. Bxh6 {Cant see anything wrong with this.  If he takes me I have his queen.  Cant spot anything else where. } Qf7 {This again attacks my king side of the board attacking f2 square which is defended by my knight but with no pawn on both f and h file, rook behind g7 pawn and no white squared bishop it is going to be hard to break through to my king.  } 15. Bd2 {Bishop needed retreating e3 faces an attack on d4.  g5 looked vulnerable but I suppose it would have stopped a castle and would have been more attacking if backed up by my queen. } O-O-O {as predicted queen-side castle moving his king to safety} 16. b4 {I am going to try and open things up now. I would like pawn exchange.  And trying to lose some material off the board hopefully exposing his king.  Couple of Brucie bonuses to look out for with pawns on a7 and e5.} b5 {Surely the only logical explanation here is to stop my pawn on b4 advancing attacking his knight.  I don't like his position of four pawns all in a row and if I can make some tidy exchanges I will have blown his kings defence right away.} 17. bxc5 {Only time will tell if this is a good move I am going to have to be aware of f2 square now though (assuming he takes my pawn with his bishop)} Bxc5 {Obvious} 18. O-O {Better castle to release some pressure} Rgh8 {This brings the rook into play from behind the pawn but what else??I cant see yet what it can do other than strengthen the proposed attack on my king but no immediate danger.} 19. Be3 {My preferred plan here is bishop for bishop to try to continue clearing pieces away from his king.} d4 {I knew he would do that. } 20. Bg5 {Not much else to do here.  This place puts my bishop king side to help with defence slightly also is starting to threaten to get pieces around to his king.  It would be handy but unlikely if i could get my bishop around my knight onto g3.} Rd7 {I would have thought he would have backed up his queen but this could help him after my next move.} 21. Qb1 {attacking the weak b5.  He may use the rook although but a7 looks stronger.  } a6 {as predicted} 22. Qb3 {Initially I am considering a pawn exchange to remove b5 using c2 pawn.  This will protect enpassant.  This also limits his queens movement as his queen is protecting his e6 pawn.  If he threatens me with his knight on a5 I have an elaborate exchange plan that will remove (hopefully) plenty of material off the board and give me a strong advantage.} Rb7 {potentially threatens my queen} 23. c4 {this virtually forces a pawn exchange } Rh5 {moves my bishop protects e5 but wheres he going with it?  Perhaps I guess he has desire to move his knight possibly a5.} 24. Bd2 {this will protect the Na5. Not much else I could do. } Be7 {assuming target g4 to threaten f2 and increase the mounting pressure on my king.} 25. cxb5 {My plans do not seem to be quite working.  With the increasing attack on my king I need to sort something quich. My plan is something like this.  Rxb5 Qc4.   Rb6 (protecting both pawn and knight) Ra1b1.  Rxb1 Qxc6 .  Kb8.   Rxb1  Ka7.  Qb7#   } Rxb5 {Rxb5} 26. Qc4 {Qc4} Kd7 {best option} 27. Rab1 {still going for the rook exchange to allow me to try and get round to his king.} Rxb1 {rook for....} 28. Rxb1 {...rook} Qf8 {This is a good move for me now I can get a big advantage at least or mate depending on his next move.} 29. Rb7+ {Kd6 mate in three.  Kc8 mate in two.  Kd8 mate in two.  Ke8 big advantage.  } Ke8 {ok Ke8} 30. Qxc6+ {considered taking pawn on e6 but thought I might mess up so took the material advantage.} Kf7 {only move} 31. Bb4 {lets try and get rid of some more pieces } Kg8 {What has he done there? } 32. Qxe6+ {Check.  hopefully he will block with queen if not I will get bishop anyway. looks like I should win } Kh7 {for him that stops an eventual pin to his queen and the capture if he blocked.} 33. Rxe7 {The rook stops him moving his pawn if I can get my knight to f6} Qf4 {this threw me.  I was baffled as to what to do.  I very nearly moved g3 which would have put the game back on.} 34. Nf6+ {He cant take with queen or pawn which will give me his rook and be virtual game over} Kh8 {A courteous resignation.} 35. Re8# {Checkmate!}
