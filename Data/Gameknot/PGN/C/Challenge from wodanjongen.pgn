1. e4 {When this match was over I conversed with my opponent and he informed me that he "simply threw away an easy win" after 15. Qc3 and that bringing out my queen was a mistake as the moves made by my queen were forced (which they were) He also pointed out that i was one of the  lower rated players and as such he wouldn't be playing me anytime soon as losing to me would stop him from getting into the 2000s maybe more....} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {The sicilian. seems to be very common, I am trying to adopt it as my opening for black, still learning but getting there :)} 4. d4 cxd4 5. Bb5+ Bd7 6. Qxd4 {Looking at this now its just wrong Nxd4 or Bxd7 are much better.} Bxb5 7. Nxb5 Nc6 {So now the queen starts to get eyed up.} 8. Qa4 {thinking behind this is simple attack on a7 pawn after 9. Be3 as well as development. Queen in a very weak position though and whites opening is severely flawed.} e6 9. Be3 a6 10. Nc3 b5 {Queen forced again only thing for it is Qb3 as Qa3 is threatened again and wastes whites moves again as black gains more position on the board as well as a free pawn and disrupting f3 knight.} 11. Qb3 d5 12. Ne2 {preventing fork. best square for obvious reasons white loses material at any rate with....} Nxe4 {Things are not looking good at this junction for white. } 13. O-O-O {castling queenside. unorthodox, however IMO gives better defensive/counterattacking options. white is still in a bad position and needs something from somewhere.} Be7 {? only reason for the question mark is this typical every day move gave me something to aim for. A plan to get Qc3.} 14. Ng3 {threatening knight this could allow for me to get something from a very poor position.} Nd6 15. Qc3 {As i refer to in the first page this is where my opponent advised me he lost heart and felt he lost the game and threw away his victory. My low rating little plan had worked.} Nc4 {Since I have been reading alot of annotation from marin, heinz etc they usually talk about keeping tempi so instead of steaming in i thought about keeping tempi as long as i can and cause black maximum trouble especially as whites position aint great. also i got a message saying "weaken my kingside then" those messages make me suspicious so i took my time on this one, amazingly about 2 days....had christmas shopping to do though as well.} 16. Nh5 {thought this was best forces black to lose castling rights and leaves his king in a position where i can get to him. also keeps tempi firmly with white.} Kd7 17. Qxg7 {wins back the pawn white lost so easily.} Nxe3 18. fxe3 Qg8 19. e4 {without a doubt the best move here asks black the question and ensures white tempi after anything black does.} Qxg7 20. Nxg7 Rhg8 21. exd5 Rxg7 22. dxc6+ Kxc6 23. Ne5+ {white with better position and tempi.} Kb6 {I really wanted to play Rhf1 here with the possibility of gaining material but looked risky and wouldn't work as Bg5  so would have had to move king first and thought that was a waste. Also last time i took a risk against this opponent i paid for it.} 24. Rhe1 Re8 25. c3 {I really enjoyed what black does here......} Bg5+ 26. Kc2 {king onto white square important when playing against 1 bishop.} f6 27. Nf3 Bf4 28. g3 Bc7 {best place for bishop to be, prevents Rd6  getting his bishop there was simple but also very elegant. (i appreciate nice moves like that, whatever the rating whoever the player)} 29. Nd4 {alot happens from here on in. I will not comment on all only the vital ones.} e5 30. Nf5 Rg5 31. Ref1 Kc6 32. Kb3 {keeps black from harrasing king and allows me to concentrate on greater prizes.} h5 33. Ne3 Rf8 34. Nd5 f5 {was tempted for the swap but again i had an upper hand and the bishop can only cover certain squares itself so the knight is much more valuable.} 35. Ne7+ Kb7 36. h4 Rxg3 37. Nxf5 Rg2 38. Rd7 Kc6 39. Rh7 {starting to make tempi work for me in terms of material, however black now gets to take d file and strengthen his rooks position.} Rd8 40. Rxh5 Rdd2 41. Rb1 {ties my rook up but i still have advantage and blacks bishop is now more in the way than i would like.} a5 42. Rh6+ Kc5 43. Re6 Kd5 44. Re7 Bd6 45. Nxd6 Kxd6 46. Re8 Rde2 47. h5 Rgh2 48. Rb8 e4 {I understand this but i think it could have waited this defeats purpose of Rh2} 49. Rxb5 e3 50. h6 {attempting something cheeky :) didn't think it'd ever work but worth a shot!} Reg2 {? spoke to opponent at time. He advised this was a mistake he should have played Ref2} 51. Rxa5 Rgf2 {corrected at expense white in better position and far more comfortable} 52. Ra6+ Ke5 53. Rb6 e2 54. Rb7 Kd6 55. Rg7 Kc5 56. Rg5+ Kd6 57. Rg6+ Ke5 58. Re1 Kf5 59. Rg7 {tried a few times previously trying to check king and exchange rooks.} Ke6 {black has now lost the match but this move seals it.} 60. h7 Kf6 61. Rg8 Rxh7 62. Rf8+ Rf7 63. Rxf7+ Kxf7 64. Kc2 Ke6 65. Kd2 Kd5 66. Rxe2 Rf4 67. b3 {Black resigns and i snatch victory from the jaws of a easy defeat!  my opening was terrible and had no right to win that match however 1 mistake and a period of tempi allows for a nice little match. I'd like to thank my opponent for allowing a rematch to a lower rated player who should have been a easy victory!  Lessons to be learn't from this match:  Keeping tempi rocks!  and the big one: If you lose dont be sore about it smile and move on to the next game and take what you have learn't from that game. There is no need to be unpleasent and say "your lucky". chess, i feel, is about respect, humility and fun.  Thanks to my opponent for the game and my motivation.  David.}
