1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e5 4. Nc3 d6 5. e4 Nbd7 {(WH) At the time this was my favorite move order. I did not like 5... B-K2 after 6 P-KN3 and wanted to retain the option of a King's side fianchetto. Since this game I have been forced to realize the strength after 6 P-KN3 P-KN3 7 B-N2 B-N2 of 8 N-R3! when White is well-prepared for P-B4. The Old Benoni needs a re-think. } 6. Nf3 Be7 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O a6 9. Qc2 {(WH) White plans to hold up ...P-B4. Usual is 9 P-QR3 N-K1 10 P-QN4 P-QN3 11 R-N1 P-N3 12 B-R6 N-N2 13 Q-Q2, though I expect I would have played 9 or 10 ...K-R1 here to keep White guessing.} Ne8 10. a3 Kh8 {(WH) Good psychology! Usually Black plays 10... P-KN3 11 B-R6 N-N2 followed by ... N-B3, ...K-R1 and ...N-N1 to chase away the bishop. Playing ...K-R1 first looks eccentric but can hardly be worse.} 11. Rb1 g6 12. Bd3 Ng7 13. Bh6 Nf6 14. b4 b6 15. bxc5 {(WH) Probably premature. In such positions it is usually best to maintain the tension until White is ready to exploit the opening of the QN file.} bxc5 16. Na4 Bg4 17. Nd2 Nfh5 {(WH) It no longer seemed necessary to play ... N-N1 so I decided to move all my pieces nearer his King to see what would happen.} 18. Rfe1 {(WH) It must be better to play 18 P-B3 B-Q2 199 N-N6 followed by NxB, though Black is still a little better.} Bg5 19. Bxg7+ Kxg7 20. Nf1 Ra7 21. Ne3 Bxe3 {(WH) Naturally! Now Black has the better minor pieces and a promising attacking position.} 22. Rxe3 Bd7 23. Nc3 f5 24. Qb2 {(WH) 24 PxP was essential.} f4 25. Ree1 f3 26. g3 {(WH) I thought it was all over now: Black's attack must mate. I expected 26 Q-N6 QxQ 27 RxQ N-B5 with a clear advantage to Black.} Bh3 27. Qb6 Qe7 28. Bc2 Nf4 29. Ba4 {(WH) 29 PxN RxP 30 K-R1 Q-N4 31 QxR ch K-R3 is too easy.} Rf7 {(WH) There are many ways to win now. I thought I might as well strengthen my position before closing in for the kill -- it saves the energy of working out complications.} 30. Rb3 Qf6 {(WH) Objectively 30... Q-N4 immediately is better, but I hoped for the continuation 31 KR-N1 N-K7 ch! 32 NxN PxN 33 P-B3 QxP! 34 RxQ RxR 35 QxR ch K-R3 and White's extra Queen doesn't help.} 31. Bc6 Qg5 32. Qb8 Bg2 {(WH) This could have been played earlier, but now it requires no calculation.} 33. h4 {(WH) Or 33 PxN Q-N5 34 N-K2 B-R8 ch 35 N-N3 Q-R6.} Qg4 {(WH) Also 33... N-R6 ch 34 K-R2 NxP 35 PxQ N-N5 ch 36 K-N1 P-B7 ch 37 KxB PxR (Q) wins, but the text is simpler and quicker.} 34. Qxd6 Qh3 35. Qxe5+ Rf6 {Quinones resigns.}
