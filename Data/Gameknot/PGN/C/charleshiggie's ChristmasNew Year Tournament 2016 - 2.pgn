[Opening "Sicilian (B30), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)"]

1. e4 {I start off with my usual.} c5 {And, he answers with the Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {But, this, however, is another example of how intense openings can be.  As, for me, we're in unfamiliar territory.  The only moves that I'm familiar with are 2...d6 or 2...Nf6.} 3. Bb5 {So, I am trying to meet that change which is what you're supposed to do.} e6 {My guess is that Charles is still trying to mix things up.  And, were it not for his c5, I'd play 4.d4, but I don't want to exchange, yet.} 4. O-O {So, I castle instead because I like getting my K in a safe spot.} Nge7 {With a self imposed pin that he'll do, if I answer with Ne5 which will happen later on, Charles will now have a good defender against two attackers.} 5. d3 {Wanting to develop my Bc1 and enjoying the pawn chain that I've now got, this move was played.  What also came into consideration was 5.Nb1, but I felt that I'd hold off and play this first because I feel more comfortable.  And, my idea is trying to be comfortable as this is what will prevent from becoming impulsive enough to rush.  Or, just deciding on only one move like exchanging, and that's combined with judgement and mobility which all blends into what I learned from Kenneth_fiore_3.  The idea is to stay calm in order to play good chess.} a6 {I was a little surprised to see Charles play this since it is more often played in the Ruy Lopez.  But, I guess that with any openings, the opponent doesn't enjoy the pinned N.  Of course, I am not going to exchange yet because I might need that B later on.  Instead, I'm treating like the Spanish Opening, in which case, after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6, it is better to not exchange right away with 4.Bxc6  I found the logic behind this with GM Susan Polgar.  The logic is that right in the opening like that, B's are generally favored over N's, and exchanging that B that early will often lead you with a disadvantage. } 6. Bc4 b5 {After which, this move is also followed.} 7. Bb3 d5 {The idea is exchanging pawn. } 8. exd5 {Figuring that there was no way to avoid it, I exchanged.  But, I didn't evaluate this carefully.  I looked at 8.e5, and felt that I'd lose a pawn with 8...Nxe5.  What I forgot, however, is that my e5 pawn would've been protected by my Nf3.} exd5 9. Bf4 {?? This was played to continue developing as I intend to develop my Nb1.  The real question is when.  However, this is a blunder that is similar to the Noah's Ark Trap.  Just like what happened in a consultation game between brigadecommander and stalhandske, I overlooked that my B will be trapped here with the next move.  In the process, I'm going to lose a piece for a pawn.  With best play, which I expect from black, Charles will win the game.  I am, however, not resigning yet, as I feel that there is more to learn.  That is especially with the Queens off the board.} c4 10. dxc4 dxc4 11. Qxd8+ Nxd8 12. Bxc4 bxc4 13. Re1 {As now, black's Ne7 is pinned.  And, the reason why that could be of significance is because of what Jack Stockel emphasized in my loss against Loyd during an OTB tourney.  That is, what good is to have extra points, like a piece if you can't use it.  In my case, it was one piece remaining undeveloped, with which, Loyd was going to win it back.  So, I kept that in mind with this pin.} Ne6 {Seeing the same thing, though, Charles break the pin by attacking my N.} 14. Bd6 {So, I try to do something different leaving a half pin.  Though ineffective, just like what I learned with Yoga, everyday is a different journey.  And, it's about where that journey is.  So, we accept things for the way they are.  Just like in Yoga when you have a hard time, and sometimes, can't fulfill the balance.  You don't fight, but rather, accept it.  Well, that's also the way that chess work which is also why I compare chess to Yoga classes since, overtime, they have helped me to become a better player.} a5 {I think that Charles is trying to get a passed pawn, somehow.} 15. Nc3 {In case he plans to do something with his a or c pawns, I block c4 and try to stop him from playing 15...a4  However, I forgot that he could still do that due blacks Ra8.} Bb7 {Threatening to exchange and mess up my K side pawn structures which is very important.} 16. Ne5 {So, I put a stop to that, by attacking Charles c4 pawn.} Rc8 {Which he protects.} 17. Nb5 {So, I plan to attack his Rook.} Ba6 {But, after this move, I realized that it wouldn't work, which is why he played this.  As after 18.Na7 Ra8, my N is trapped.  And, that would force me to liquidate N's which I don't want to do since I'm behind.  Therefore, I decide to bring it back to where it was developed keeping in mind now that he can't advance his pawn to a4 due to the R moving.  And, even if it hadn't, there would be interference since his Rook would be blocked by blacks Ba6.} 18. Nc3 Nc6 {I know that an exchange is forced.  But, I ask myself what to exchange.  In the end, I decide to trade off B's.  As now, I have a small amount of hope of counterplay since Charles can no longer castle.  Actually he can but can't avoid the loss of tempo if he recaptures with 19...Nxf8.} 19. Bxf8 Rxf8 20. Ng4 {And, in doing so, I also refuse to exchange N's.} Kd7 {I am not sure why Charles played this.  But, I felt that throwing in some checks was the way to go.} 21. Rad1+ Kc7 22. Nd5+ Kb7 23. b3 {I attempt to force another exchange with Rb1+ in mind.} Rcd8 {But, Charles refuses by half pinning my Nd5.} 24. bxc4 {I decide to exchange pawns in order to place him in check, regardless.  I'm asking myself what I could do after that.} Bxc4 25. Rdb1+ {I quickly figured out that there is nothing else.  As my Rooks aren't doubled.  For, had one Rook been out, I would've been able to do the other and ambush the King.  But, that will not work, in this position.} Ka7 26. Nde3 {So, I get a little aggressive by attacking his Bc4.} Ba6 27. c4 {And, I push my passed pawn being that it's protected by my Ne3.} Rd2 {The surprise is that he hits my a2 pawn.  So, I protect since 28.a3 will lose it at once to 28...Ra2  Therefore, the next move is the only option.} 28. Rba1 Rb8 {Now comes nasty which I overlook.} 29. Rec1 {As I am fixated on trying to protect the other pawn.  But, better was 29.Red1 to delay or maybe even prevent what comes next.} Rbb2 {As two Rooks on the same rank are very dangerous.  But, it's not the worst that occurs as I missed the big picture.} 30. a4 {?? And, that was by playing this move.  The idea was to protect the pawn since Charles was threatening to win a pawn.  But, it was still a lost position.  However, I think that it would've been difficult for Charles to win.  This move, however, makes it even, as I'm gonna lose another piece without anything in return.  So, best was 30.g3, as then I could get out of this situation with 31.Ng2.} h5 {With that, I resigned here.  Against someone closer to my strength or not as strong, I'd continue after 31...Nxg4 and hope for a draw, generally by stalemate.  But, something draw by rep or 50 move rule.  But, against someone of this strength, I don't stand a chance.  And, with it, there is nothing else to learn from this position, so I felt that resignation was called for here.}
