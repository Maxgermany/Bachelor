I guess the intention is to fianchetto the QB.} 4. f5 Bb7 {Jenkins is ignoring the K-side, where the danger lies.} 5. Nc3 {Preparing for his next move.} Bb4 6. Qh5+ {The King-hunt begins.} Ke7 7. Qf7+ Kd6 8. Nb5+ {This is why the Knight was developed before Q-R5 ch, in anticipation of flushing the K to Q3.} Kc6 9. Qd5# {Game, set and match.}
