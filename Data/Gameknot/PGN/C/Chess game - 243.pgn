1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nd4 {The Bird Defense. Unusual and highly tactical.} 4. Nxd4 exd4 5. O-O c6 6. Bc4 d6 7. Re1 Nf6 8. c3 Ng4 9. h3 Ne5 {Up to this point, this is the Main Line of the Bird Defence.} 10. Bf1 d3 {Very aggressive play.} 11. f4 Qb6+ {White is better developed in that he's already castled, but Black's pieces are more active.} 12. Kh1 {The natural move -- but it allows Black to unleash a ferocious assault.} h5 {A sacrifice to open lines pointing at White's King.} 13. fxe5 {White goes by Steinitz's rule: the best way to refute a sacrifice is to accept it. But now his King's defences are blasted open.} Bg4 {If White plays 14 hxg4???, the response is 14... hxg4#} 14. Qb3 Qf2 {Penetrating into the heart of White's position.} 15. Qxb7 Rd8 16. Rd1 Bxd1 {Now material is in Black's favor, and his attack still rages.} 17. Qxc6+ {White's desperate counter-attack begins. If it fails, Black will drive through to mate.} Ke7 18. Qc7+ Rd7 19. exd6+ Kf6 {Brilliant play. If White succumbs to the temptation of 20 Qxd7???, there follows 20...Qxf1+ 21 Kh2 Qf4+ 22 Kg1 Bxd6!!! 23 Qf5+ Qxf5 24 exf5 Bg3!!! and mate is forced.} 20. e5+ Kxe5 21. Qxd7 Qxf1+ {Black regains the initiative and drives his final attack home brilliantly.} 22. Kh2 Bxd6 23. c4 Qf4+ 24. Kh1 Kf6 {White resigns. His undeveloped Queen-side pieces have no more than statistical value, and the threat of 25...Qh2# cannot be stopped without massive loss of material. If white tries 25 Kg1, there follows 25... Qh2+ 26 Kf1 Be2+ and mate is only a matter of moves.}
