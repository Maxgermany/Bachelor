1. d4 {2nd game with borisrub. This thime I had a very strong attack, i may have lost something. But finally, he made every necessary move to transform my victory in draw. It could even have been worse if I had made other mistakes.} g6 2. Nf3 d6 3. e3 Bg7 4. a3 Nd7 5. Nbd2 Ngf6 6. Rb1 c5 {i decided to come back to c5 options, since I find no way in e5.} 7. c3 O-O 8. g3 d5 9. Bg2 c4 10. O-O Nb6 {Gosh  i feel free, compared to almost all my black previous games!} 11. Ne5 {well he thinks he can scare me} Nfd7 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. b3 Qc7 {I have the impression that i have more space, more security too...} 14. bxc4 dxc4 15. e4 {he gets the center, but strangely enough, I don't feel any danger here.} Na4 16. Qc2 b5 {I have the queen side, obviously} 17. Bb2 Rac8 18. f4 Qb6 19. Nf3 Bg4 20. h3 Bxf3 {Here start a combination I was planning for a long time. I just had to get rid of this knight} 21. Bxf3 {I like horses, but not in my opponent's game} Nxb2 {here we comes. I think white has only forced moves, here.} 22. Qxb2 a6 {to prepare my queen move} 23. a4 Bxd4+ 24. cxd4 c3 {haha, did you see that one?} 25. Qf2 b4 26. Rfc1 a5 {isn't that strong enough to compensate the piece? let us see... The two white rooks are completely passive and mine will have all liberty to attack from now. The only advantage he has is the bishop} 27. Bd1 Rc4 28. Bc2 Rxd4 {one pawn less. White has no more passed pawn; I have two.} 29. Rcd1 Rfd8 30. Rxd4 Rxd4 31. Rd1 Rxd1+ 32. Bxd1 Qe6 {my king is too far to try the exchange.} 33. f5 {this is strange} Qxe4 {one more pawn} 34. fxg6 hxg6 {maybe this was a mistake, considering the endgame, but right now i was more preoccupied with my own pawn structure than by the white pawns on king side} 35. Kh2 Qd5 36. Qc2 Kf8 {starting the last phase of attack} 37. Kg1 Qd4+ 38. Kg2 e6 39. h4 Ke7 40. Kf3 Kd6 41. Be2 {he has no more attack. Wait for my mistakes. I had to think cautiously every move as he did not want make one...} Kc5 {my king is ready to invade c4... when the bishop goes away...} 42. Bd1 Qd5+ 43. Ke3 Qe5+ 44. Kf3 Qd5+ 45. Ke3 {well... risk of draw. He offered me sometime. I declined} f5 46. Qb3 {let us exchange?, he said} Qc4 {ok but here, i said} 47. Qc2 {well, no thanks, he said} Qf1 48. Qb3 Qe1+ {i try the attack on the other side, with many threats on his pawns.} 49. Kf3 Qe4+ 50. Kf2 Qd4+ 51. Kf3 Qc4 52. Qc2 Qe4+ {so i decided to sacrifice a pawn in exchange of a good position for my king} 53. Qxe4 fxe4+ 54. Kxe4 Kc4 55. g4 b3 56. Ke3 {he made the only good move here. Congratulations, Boris. Now it is a draw} c2 57. Bxc2 bxc2 58. Kd2 Kd5 59. Kxc2 Ke4 60. h5 gxh5 61. gxh5 {he offered me the draw again. I acceptend. there is nothing more. I calculated everything. Good game}
