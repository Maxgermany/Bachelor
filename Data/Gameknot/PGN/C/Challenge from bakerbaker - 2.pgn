[Opening "Scotch gambit (C44)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch opening.} exd4 4. Bc4 {This isn't the main variation of the Scotch, but I don't want to waste time taking Black's d4 pawn (for piece developing purposes)} h6 {Black is overly concerned about me playing Ng5.} 5. O-O {I still don't take Black's pawn, because if he tries to hold onto it, I have a neat tactic, which will win back the pawn and retain my lead in development.} Bc5 {Black thinks he has won a pawn, but I will get it back and have a better position.} 6. c3 {I am threatening to win back the pawn and take over the centre with cxd4, so Black decides to take on c3, but I will still get the pawn back. Just watch.} dxc3 7. Bxf7+ {Doesn't lose a piece. I will get back the piece along with my lost pawn.} Kxf7 8. Qd5+ {Black's bishop on c5 is gone, leaving me only down a pawn, but after I take the pawn on c3, material will be even and I'll have a lead in development.} Ke8 {I was hoping for Kg6 Qf5 mate!} 9. Qh5+ {I need Black's king on a dark square so that I can take the bishop with check, giving me an extra move to take on c3.} Kf8 {If Black plays g6 trying to lure my queen away from his bishop, then Qxg6  Kf8 Qf5  Ke8 Qh5  gets us back to where we started from, except Black's g-pawn is missing. And if Black plays Ke7 instead of Kf8, then I can fork his king and his h8-rook with my queen.} 10. Qxc5+ Qe7 11. Qxe7+ Ngxe7 12. Nxc3 {Now material is even, but I have a slight advantage due to my strong centre pawn, and Black's king is misplaced.} d6 13. h3 {I wanted to play Nb5 here winning Black's c-pawn, but I didn't want Black to play Bg4 and Bxf3, ruining my pawn structure, because a lot of times it is better to have fewer pawns than to have weak pawns.} a6 {Black stops Nb5} 14. Rd1 {I've taken claim to the d5 square while placing my rook on an open file. My other rook is destined for my open c-file.} Ng6 {A mistake, allowing me to play a good move next.} 15. Nd5 {Black cannot defend his immobile c-pawn and will lose it.} Nce5 16. Nxe5 Nxe5 {16...dxe5 was much better, because now I am going to win the pawn on d6 after c7 falls. Usually I don't like games where my opponent blunders, but I love the way I finished him off at the end.} 17. Nxc7 Ra7 18. Rxd6 Ke7 19. Rd1 {Rd5 is a more active move, but I'd rather play it safe while I'm up two pawns with a good position. } b5 {Threatening my knight.} 20. Bf4 {Now if Black takes my knight, then Bxe5 wins the g-pawn.} Nc4 21. Nd5+ Kf7 22. b3 Na5 23. Rac1 {Now all my forces are very active, while Black's are either misplaced or undeveloped.} Be6 {23...Be6?? Black tries desperately to activate a piece, but doesn't notice the tactic I'm about to play, which will either win a knight, or win a rook at the price of only a bishop.} 24. Bc7 {I'm attacking Black's weak knight. The first move of my genius tactic.} Nb7 {If 24....Bxd5, then 25. exd5 Not 25. Rxd5 because Rc8 annoyingly pins my bishop.} 25. Bb6 Raa8 {At this point, I can play Rc7  and Rxb7, which was the point of my tactic, but Black's 26th move was terrible, so I don't even need to take the knight to win. The next eight moves are all checks, ending with a nice mate. Enjoy!} 26. Rc7+ Kg6 27. Nf4+ Kf6 28. Bd4+ Kg5 29. Nxe6+ Kg6 30. Rxg7+ Kh5 31. g4+ Kh4 32. Bf6+ Kxh3 33. Nf4# {Usually a series of checks ending with mate only occurs with queens on the board, but here I have demonstrated that this can be acheived even in the endgame.}
