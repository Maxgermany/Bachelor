1. e4 e5 2. c4 Bc5 3. Nh3 Qf6 4. Nc3 d6 {Threatening the Knight} 5. Nd5 {Good move - surprised me.} Qd8 6. a3 {Slow attack on the B?  Otherwise I don't get it.  I think it is a wasted move right now.} c6 7. Qa4 {nice defense of the knight} Bd7 8. Ne3 Bxe3 {I hate your knights and don't mind trading b's for them.} 9. dxe3 c5 10. Qd1 Bc6 11. f3 a6 {This seems like a better time to pull this pawn up.} 12. f4 {You lost the game here.  Initiative is mine - I threatened e4 on turn 10 and you immediately move off that protection.} Bxe4 13. Ng5 f5 14. b4 {Another strange move.  I am only up a pawn.  I might have traded the other knight for my other bishop.  I have g3 pinned.  a critical point in the game.  If you didn't trade pieces, you could move Nf3 to force me to trade if I want.} exf4 {but instead I get another pawn.} 15. Ne6 {Another critical error.  You have GOT to move me off of e4 or get Bf1 moving so you can castle.} Qh4+ {g3 in turn 14 would have prevented this too.} 16. Kd2 {Now I am playing chase the king.  G3 would be really helpful now, but it is still pinned. } fxe3+ 17. Kxe3 Qh6+ 18. Nf4 {nice recovery.  again it shows why I hate your N's} Qf6 19. Rb1 Bxb1 {Oops.  Might not have mattered much, but still a mistake.} 20. Bd3 Qe5+ 21. Kf3 Bxd3 22. Re1 {I think you should have taken the B.  You get too fancy with the Re1 move and ...} Be4+ {I save the B AND put you in check AND free my Q from being pinned.} 23. Ke3 Ne7 {I want the free pawn (g2), but then my Q is pinned again.  I make this move to add another layer in front of my K, plus open up O-O} 24. Qh5+ g6 25. Nxg6 {nice snag and threatens h8 and prevents O-O} f4+ {Stupid move.} 26. Nxf4+ Qxh5 {I really had no choice but to trade Q's.  I am way ahead on points, so the trade favors me.} 27. Nxh5 Bg6 28. Nf6+ Kf7 29. Rf1 Nbc6 30. Ne4+ Nf5+ 31. Kf4 Rhd8 32. g4 Nfd4 33. Ke3+ Kg7 34. bxc5 Nc2+ 35. Kf4 Rdf8+ 36. Kg3 Rxf1 37. cxd6 Rxc1 38. Nc5 Rg1+ 39. Kf3 Rf8+ 40. Ke2 Rg2+ {}
