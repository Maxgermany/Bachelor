1. c4 e5 {Computers seem to think that this move gives black near equality.  However, I am not totally comfortable with it and I used to play 1. ... c5 instead. } 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 {3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e3 Bb4 5. Qc2 O-O 6. Nd5 Be7 is slightly better. } c6 4. Bg2 { } d5 5. cxd5 cxd5 6. d4 exd4 7. Qxd4 Nc6 8. Qd1 d4 {Black likes to attack. } 9. Ne4 Bb4+ {Nxe4 followed by Bb4+ is a good alternative.  So are Bg4, Bf5 and Be7. } 10. Nd2 {10. Bd2 Nxe4 11. Bxe4 O-O Is a little better.  12. Nf3 Bh3 13. Ng5?? Qxg5 } d3 {O-O and Bf5 are just as good. } 11. e3 Bg4 {Expecting Nf3.  Castling first would be common sense. } 12. Ngf3 { } O-O 13. O-O {13. h3 Be6 Is slightly better. } Ne5 14. h3 Nxf3+ { } 15. Nxf3 Bxf3 16. Qxf3 d2 {Black's little tactic.  What follows is interesting. } 17. Rd1 Rc8 18. Qxb7 dxc1=Q 19. Rdxc1 { } a5 {Rxc1 and Bc5 are also good.  I am not particularly fond of trading pieces unless there is a good reason for it. } 20. Rcd1 Bd2 21. Qb3 Qd7 22. a3 Rc5 {22... Rfd8  Is also good.  Black probably had lots of good choices here. } 23. Kf1 { } a4 24. Qa2 { } Qb5+ {Rc2, Rfc8 and Qd3+ are also good. } 25. Kg1 Rc2 26. Rab1 {Instead 26. Qb1 prevents Black's next move. } Bxe3 27. Rdf1 Qe2 {Rfc8 is also good. } 28. Kh2 {Disastrous move in an already losing position.  This is the wrong square because it makes the king vulnerable to a check from the dark square bishop. Alternative variation: 28. Kh1 Bxf2 29. Rfc1 Bxg3 30. Rxc2 Survives longer.  } Bxf2 29. Bd5 {29. Kh1 Bxg3 30. Rg1 Ne4 31. Rbf1 Bb8  It is hard to imagine things getting worse. 32. Qd5 Ng3+ [Or Qe3 headed to g3. ] 33. Kh2 Nxf1+ 34. Kh1 Ng3+ 35. Kh2 Ne4+ 36. Kh1 Nf2# } Bg1+ {}
