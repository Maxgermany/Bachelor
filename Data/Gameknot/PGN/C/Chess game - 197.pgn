1. e4 {This was my simul game against retured GM Lars Bo Hansen, the former captain of the dutch national team. Of course I didn't have much of a chance, but it was fun and we used hour and a half clocks in 18 games so he had time problems. I was white} c6 {Too much to ask for Ruy Lopez I suppose. I spent a solid minute and a half before deciding he only did that to set up d5. So I pre-empted it.} 2. Nc3 d5 {I wasn't ecstatic about losing my king's pawn this early against a GM, but I didn't see a hugely sucessfull way to decline.} 3. exd5 cxd5 {And to prevent my knight getting booted...} 4. d4 Nc6 {To develope pieces, prevent a check (giving him extra initiative), and support that d pawn I thought that Nf3 would be best. I still wonder on the best possible move.} 5. Nf3 Nf6 {I decided this was likely so he could play e5 next. instead of preventing the move, I undermined its protector.} 6. Bb5 Bg4 {While he returns favor... I'm not sure if h3 gives me a distinct weakness (I'm not used to playing against players who can exploiut that crazy type of stuff) so I wait and see how he responds to pressure. LAst thing I want to do is play defense against a 2600+.} 7. Bg5 e6 {That was so he could develope that bishop and let it out. I wanted to take that knight (because knight tactics always get me and he can probably come up with some insane ones) and I wanted to exchange that g5 bishop, but not for the expense of having that f3 knight overloaded with him pinning my queen. I move the queen so I can cover both of my knights. Again, I still wish I knew the best move here.} 8. Qd3 Bxf3 {A true nobrainer move for me next.} 9. Qxf3 Be7 {Well that wasn't too hard to see. He's a subtle player who doesn't leave gaps like that. I think for a while about whether that queenside gap on his side would serve me best on the b or c collumn. Ultimately, this move helped undue me, so looking back I put a ? beside it on my score card. But I decided that a gap on the b collumn would leave an isolated pawn he would have to work to defend.} 10. Bxc6+ bxc6 {I decide to leave that knight as is because that bishop is dangerous on the diagonal I would have given it. I also wanted to prevent Rb8.} 11. Bf4 Qb6 {Of course I would do this. I knew that castling queenside would lead to a lot of problems but I also don't want to be down material in this game. So I castled queenside even though I thouht I would do better on the other side.} 12. O-O-O O-O {Fortunately I had more pieces on that side. I knew it would be this easy but I was thinking a Qg3 then Bh6 situation... But I didn't think through it too well.} 13. Qg3 Nh5 {Now I don't have anything to prevent Rb8. But I must save the king. } 14. Qf3 Nxf4 {No brainer again} 15. Qxf4 Qa5 {For some reason I decided to play Kb1 here to help defend that pawn. Maybe my second worst move of the game (the worst coming later.) A friend of mine watched me make the movie and actually luaghed out loud... On my score sheet I listed it as Kb1??????? Not only does this not help defend, it sets me up to suffer all kinds of crazy tactics without much of an escape route.} 16. Kb1 Rab8 {And there it is. I thought the end was knigh here. I moved the queen to f3 so that I could move the knight and the queen would be guarding a valuable row. Also, if he moved the queen like I expected he couldn't play Ba3 then.} 17. Qf3 Rb4 {I knew there were way too many things to go wrong on that b2 square... probably a mistake but I also had a trap in mind.} 18. b3 c5 {So far so good for the trip. It sure didn't hurt that it was a simul. In a regular game he would never take it, but I thought I saw a way here.} 19. Na4 Qxa4 {Bait taken. Now all there was to do was pray I didn't miscalculate.} 20. c3 Rxb3+ {I couldn't believe it. I want to run fritz on this game and see if I was actually beating Bo Hansen at this point. I obviously cut it closer than it was. I was in shock.} 21. axb3 Qxb3+ {I wanted to offer a draw before this move but tournament rules didn't allow it. Unfortunaly, I didn't remember that bishop in my now distracted state and I blew the entire game. Would I have pulled it off if I played Ka1? I'll probably never know. I can't calculate it at least.} 22. Kc1 Bg5+ {And there's the game. I only had two legal moves and neither were any good. } 23. Rd2 Rb8 {There goes the death blow. Literally the only reason I didn't resign here was because I didn't want to lose first.} 24. Qd3 cxd4 {Sure. Just throw that in. There's a GM move for you. Instead of pulverizing you this move I'll pulverize you a tiny bit worse in two. But that sets up a bunch of nasty tactics.} 25. Qc2 Qa3+ 26. Kd1 Bxd2 {Kxd2 ... Rb2 or Qxd2... Rb1. Either way not pretty. But someone else at the end was closing in on a loss so I did it anyways.} 27. Qxd2 Rb1+ 28. Ke2 {I make the move, but it's over. I know it. But then someone at the end gets checkmated and I resign. It was good but I blew it on turn 22. No shock but I wish I could have taken that one back. So I resign  He was talking about chess personalities about 3 weeks before at our school. I pinpointed his personality and then asked him how one could beat that type. He said by forgoing subtle games and forcing that person to make sharp, distinct moves with lots of pros and cons. Which I tried, but that's also a way to lose quicker as well.  At least I can say I was going to go 40 turns against a guy who came 10th in the world open.}
