1. d4 d5 2. Nd2 {?! Hmm... I suppose he's headed for the stonewall, but I don't really like this move it blocks in his DSB.} c5 {Well I'm the most comfortable with the queen's gambit so why not?} 3. c3 cxd4 4. cxd4 Nc6 {Now that the c pawns are gone his knight on d2 looks a little out of place.} 5. e3 {Well he continues with his stonewall anyway.} Bf5 6. a3 {?! I don't think this accomplishes much.} e6 7. f4 {Common in stonewall, this creates a huge hole on e4 which a black knight loves to fill.} Bd6 {I develop my bishop to a nice square.} 8. Ngf3 Nf6 {Ready to hop onto e4.} 9. Ne5 Bxe5 10. fxe5 {I know that the doubled f pawns are very common in the stonewall.} Ne4 {He can trade but then I get a *very* nice bishop instead of a *very* nice knight.} 11. Bd3 {Extra pressure but misses...} Qh4+ {Zap!} 12. g3 Nxg3 {! Discovers an attack on his bishop, and his pawn is pinned to his rook.} 13. Nf3 {Discovering a defense to his bishop and attacking my queen. Good move.} Qh5 14. Kd2 Nxh1 {*Crunch*} 15. Qxh1 {Well after that skirmish has died down the dust settles leaving me... Up by the exchange and a pawn.} Bxd3 16. Kxd3 {His king is out in the center and it's still only the middlegame... But I don't have many pieces developed so maybe he's okay.} Qf5+ 17. Ke2 Qe4 {My queen is very nicely situated on e4, it's central and it pins his knight. Black has a huge advantage. This also threatens Nxd4, as both his knight and his pawn are pinned.} 18. Qf1 {He spots the attack.} O-O 19. Qh3 {Aiming at my kingside.} Rac8 {Trying to get my rook involved.} 20. Ng5 {Hmm, hoping I'll move off that diagonal? But it's a blunder because...} Nxd4+ {Of this!} 21. Kf2 Rc2+ {My pieces swarm in!} 22. Kg3 Nf5+ {!! He has to sac his queen!} 23. Qxf5 Qxf5 {Well skirmish No. 2 has ended, leaving my up by... ten points. Easy game now.} 24. Nf3 {He's going to make it as hard as he can.} Qg6+ 25. Kh3 Qh5+ 26. Kg3 Rc4 {I don't really have any particular plan, just trying to find a weakness.} 27. Kf2 Qg4 {I inch closer.} 28. Bd2 f5 {If he (unwisely) takes en-passant then my f rook will join in the attack.} 29. Rg1 {He does his best to defend.} Qh3 {I was tempted to just take his rook, but decided it might go faster this way.} 30. Rg3 Qh5 {He chases my queen around for a while:} 31. Rg5 Qh6 32. e4 Rxe4 33. Rg2 Qh5 34. Rg5 Qe8 {My queen says enough is enough and runs away to e8.} 35. Rg3 Qb5 {Not for long though. this threatens something very nasty and very obvious.} 36. Ng1 Qxb2 37. Nf3 {White is hopeless, his bishop is pinned and he's down twelve. I should just get my other rook into the game and then I'll win. Although, it turns out I don't need it.} Rf4 38. Kg1 Rxf3 {! If he takes then I take his bishop ending up with two minor pieces for a rook.} 39. Bh6 {! I give him this just for threatening mate when he's so far behind.} Qf2+ {I almost played Rc8 before I realized what he could do then.} 40. Kh1 Qf1+ 41. Rg1 Qxg1+ {He resigns. I felt I played pretty well, please comment and rate.}
