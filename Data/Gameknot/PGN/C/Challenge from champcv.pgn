1. b3 {A classic case of mistakes emboldening the enemy} e5 {I opened (as black) with not much attention on the game} 2. e3 d5 3. c4 d4 {I made this move to capture territory, and keep the game in his backfield} 4. exd4 Qxd4 {My queen was brought out into battle too early from my perspective in retrospect} 5. Nc3 {but I conceived a checkmate early if I could hoodwink my opponent} Nf6 {until he threatened my Queen, I would work my Knight into the battle} 6. Qf3 {No matter...} Bg4 {I like my development at this stage - I have momentum, mass and territory} 7. Qxb7 {This move  should have opened the door for me to execute my mate strategy...but I am an idiot!} Qxf2+ {so I did this because I was not paying attention and made my attack one move too early! Silly me. } 8. Kxf2 {so I got into trouble} Bd6 {and worked hard to get out of trouble, and bring the fight to my opponent } 9. Qxa8 {sacrificing my Rook in the meantime} O-O {so suddenly, I am behind on points and behind in development and looking certain to lose although I have a pretty good cadre of soldiers, and might be able to pull off an upset. } 10. Nd5 {so I have work to do as he develops his attack. I do feel secure behind my castle though, and hope to keep him at bay. } Ne4+ {depending on his answer to this move, I see a possible mate developing} 11. Ke1 {I have to get my second Knight into the battle with both his escape routes covered} g6 {and create an escape route of my own just in case. } 12. Qxa7 {This move gave me a great chance to feint an attack on this Queen while I maneuvered to my pending checkmate.} Nc6 {thus} 13. Qa4 {this retreat does not help him and in fact ensures that mate is a real threat} Nd4 {one move to mate...he only has one or two options to escape, but fails to see them} 14. d3 {instead he threatens my knight which allows me to execute } Nc2# {checkmate}
