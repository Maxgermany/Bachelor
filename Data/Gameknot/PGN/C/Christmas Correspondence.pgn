[Opening "King's Indian (A48), East Indian defence"]

1. d4 {I have played enough games against Margeaux to know not to prepare a response to 1. e4. He always opens this way.} Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. e3 {? A curious early deviation which will open up some strategic possibilities for black later on. 3. c4 would have transposed into any of several King's Indian lines and been better.} d5 4. Bd3 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. Re1 Ne4 {The first sign that 3. e3 was weak. The knight on e4 is strongly placed, and white should probably forgo his bishop pair here (7. Bxe4 dxe4) to get rid of it.} 7. Nbd2 Bf5 8. c4 {?? 8. ... Nxf2 9. Kxf2 Bxd3 and white loses a pawn. Better was 8. Nh4 to drive away the bishop.} Nc6 {??  But thankfully for Margeaux, I missed this tactic.} 9. cxd5 {Better probably was 9. Nh4 e6 10. Nxf5 exf5 11. f3 Ng5, after which white has an imposing center and has created doubled pawns for black in exchange for being less developed. White is already trailing in development, and 9. cxd5 only exacerbates the issue.} Qxd5 10. Bc4 Qd6 11. Nxe4 Bxe4 12. Ng5 {This move re-routes the bishop, which threatens and ominous-looking future Qxg2.} Bd5 {Note that black has needed to move his king's bishop and knight twice to force black away from the e4 square.} 13. Bxd5 Qxd5 14. e4 {Margeaux was angry after making this move, a clear blunder which loses a valuable central pawn.} Qxd4 15. Qb3 {Better would be 15. Qxd4 Nxd4 16. Rd1 Nc2 17. Rb1 Rfd8 18. Rxd8 Rxd8 19. Bd4, where white is down a pawn but can probably play for a draw in the endgame.} Ne5 16. Qxb7 {?! Picks up a pawn, but removes white's queen from where she is needed most. Better is 16. Be3, which keeps up the tension and prevents 16. ... Nd3 for the time being.} Nd3 17. Be3 {?? A major blunder, which shows that Margeaux did not understand the position. The threat of winning the exchange is not the primary use of the d3, but to be involved on the attack on the b2 square. White should have  defended with 17. Re2 Rab8 18. Qd5 Qxd5 19. exd5 Nxb2 20. Bxb2 Bxb2 21. Rxb2 Rxb2, where white is down the exchange and a pawn heading into a torturous endgame. Still, this is better than losing a rook outright.} Qxb2 18. Rab1 {?? Margeaux should have exchanged queens. This only makes a bad situation worse.} Qxb7 19. Rxb7 Nxe1 20. Rxc7 Rab8 {Here Margeaux resigned. After 21. Rc1 Bb2 22. Rc7 Rfc8 23. Rxc8+ Rxc8 24. Nf3 Nxf3+ 25. gxf3, white's position is in shambles and he is bleeding material.}
