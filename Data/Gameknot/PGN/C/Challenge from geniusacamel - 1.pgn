[Opening "Caro-Kann (B18), classical, Flohr variation"]

1. e4 {A very conventional opening.} c6 {The well known Caro Kann.  As you know, after having to get play against it and getting used to opponents playing so, I played this, once and, finally, adjusted to it fully in my game against Jack, as not only a win, but a first time where I did not make a single mistake or inaccuracy, and it was against this defense.} 2. d4 {Of course.  The most common response, and again, a good way to remember is that when black only advances one square, after 1.e4 then 2.d4 is generally the best response, anyway.} d5 {Despite it being the Caro Kann, as opposed to, French, the same idea still applies.  Yes, this is still the best response and will lead to some interesting variations.} 3. Nc3 {Instead, I would've played the immediate 3.exd5 with the exchange.  But, I think this is a better because it's still an exchange when he takes, and this develops a piece.  So, right now, white is already slightly ahead, given that in addition to the central pawns, he has a piece out.} dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 {Good move getting a piece.  Ok, but I would've responded with 4...Nd7  The idea is to develop N's before B's since we know where the N ought to go.} 5. Ng3 {Yes, this is also what I would've played, and not just for an attack.  If that were so, I wouldn't play it.  The idea is that after white protects with this move he can get another piece out, whereas black's B needs protection.  So, already, I'd say that white has a very small advantage because he is slightly ahead in development.} Bg6 {Ok, it protects the B.} 6. Nf3 {! As noted, develops another piece and prepares white to castle K side, which is going to happen very soon, and as quickly as I predict.} e6 {A center pawn is what it develops, so it is a good move.  But, not the best, in my mind, because white's going to finish the K side, at once whereas, black still needs to deploy more pieces.} 7. Bd3 {Yes, the move I would've played.} Nf6 {?! Ok, at least it develops.  However, this is an inaccuracy.  Best was 7...Ne7 and if white takes the LSB, black responds with the N.  Instead, now, if white does this, the only recapture is with a p.  So, this time, white would have a bigger advantage, counting structurally as nothing's lost.  As now, not only away from the center, but right near the K there would be doubled pawns, making it unsafe to castle K side as there would be a potential weakness around it.  } 8. O-O {I like this move a lot.  The K is safe and all, but I would have held off another move and played 8.Bxg6!! for the reason that I outlined a move ago.} Nbd7 {To develop another piece, but it is not the best move, however, as the N's look rather uncomfortable.  Instead, better was 8...Nc7, in my opinion.  However, I would have brought the DSB into play, immediately so that castling would be feasible, right after.} 9. Bxg6 {!! And, now what I mentioned about doubled pawns away from the center and the K having difficulties should black castle K side has become a reality.  And, with it white already has a very noticeable advantage.  Not lost for black yet, but with best play from white, geniusacamel is going to win this, quite easily.} hxg6 {It's better then 9...hxg6 which would put that K in an uncomfortable position.} 10. Bf4 {Develops the last piece.  But, what I would've played is 10.Bg5 pinning the N to Q, which is what I typically do.  There are occasions, however, where it isn't good because black would then sac a piece to get a winning advantage, as I learned.  However, this is not one of those occasions, in my opinion.} Qb6 {?! Understand why black played this.  But, it is not the right approach, which is why I'm giving it an inaccuracy.  What he assumes is that he is going to win a pawn, unless white defends.  The problem is, as you see with white's best move, there is a way to defend it.  11.b3 is also optional, but what white plays next is the best, as I learned from experience and with Jack as it avoids pressure, where later, black still threatens to win the P, so white would then lose tempo.  But, 11.Rb1 is going to prevent that.} 11. Rb1 c5 {The idea is to exchange.  Ok, fair enough.  I either would've developed the remaining piece, or castled.  And, in my books, castling Q side is safer, this time, since black has doubled pawns on the other side.  I feel that castling K side, make his K susceptible to a weakness which is something to be weary.  So, having said that, I would've played 11...0-0-0 here} 12. dxc5 Bxc5 {At least, his last piece is up and about.} 13. c4 {The intention is to get the last piece out and connect the R's.  He also intends to pin the d N, but black is not going to allow it.} Qa6 {Instead of preventing the pin, this way, I would've castled here.  And, things have drastically, as I don't like the position, anymore, if black were to castle Q side, as even without the pin, Qa4 afterward is a bit risky for black.  So, I would've castled short, in this position.} 14. Qc2 {Since 14.Qa4?? is no longer a feasibility without losing the Q, white might as well get that Q out by moving it.  } Be7 {This is not an exception to the guideline about K safety since nothing is at risk here.  So, I don't know why black hasn't castled, yet.} 15. b4 {Unlike before, I also do not know why white played this, either.  Better, however, was 15.b3! as white has a stronger pawn structure since those three pawns would be connected.  As I remember: sometimes, it's brilliant, while in other cases, it's a blunder.  In this position, it would've been extraordinarly brilliant since, from my experience the b and c pawns, often get nasty, especially the b pawn.} O-O {At last, black castles.} 16. c5 {! Yes, this move is the best way to protect the c pawn.  Another option was also 16.Be3, but I like this move better, but unlike before, it is specifically because of the fact that it strengthens white's pawn structure.} Nd5 {He's still trying to grab.} 17. Bg5 {Ok, white protects with this move.  But, I would've played 17.b5, and after 17...Qa3, I would play 18.Rb3  After analyzing the position, I realize that white would've won the Q with 17.b5 because it's trapped with what I noted, where no matter where it goes, white would've been able to capture.} Nd7f6 {To protect the B.} 18. Ne5 {But, the immediate 18.b5!! was still possible.} Rfc8 {! Now, that opportunity is gone, with this move.} 19. Rfe1 {The idea is to put pressure right in the center, and with it and for the same reason, this is the move I would've played.} Qb5 {To win the b pawn.} 20. Bxf6 {I would've played a4 right here, and not, a move later.  I recently learned from Jack this past week that when a pin is undone, meaning that the opponent breaks the pin with the B, most common and best way, it generally is not a good idea to then take that N.} Bxf6 {This is the reason, as now that black retook, like this, the person who played it will often have run into difficulties because the opponent puts pressure right on the center.  It often starts when the player takes back with BXN, as is the case here.} 21. a4 {! With this move, white has a passed pawn.  Whether it can promote or not remains to be seen.} Qb6 {?? Better was 21...Qa6 or 21...Qe8 because this move should cost black his Q.} 22. Nd3 {As said on the last move, best was 22.cxb6!, and that's what I would've played if I were white.} Qc7 {! With this move, white no longer has that opportunity to win black's Q.} 23. Ne4 {I don't know why white played this.} Rcd8 {! The idea is to attack the center, and as I learned from WB, this will help strengthen your position, and sometimes to control the center, as well.  Well, not the case here, but it does strengthen that center control.} 24. g3 {?! An inaccuracy, in my opinion.  Black was not threatening mate, and this isn't an endgame.  So, the K isn't a weapon.  Therefore, I don't know why white had to open up, like this.} Ne7 {I also don't understand the logic behind this move.  Instead, I would've played 24...Qd7 putting pressure right in the center.} 25. Qc4 {! Yes, and this is what I would've played as well as now there is a lot of pressure on the c file and a little for black to worry about here.} Nf5 {Don't understand this move too well.  But, better was 25...Rd4 which is, in fact, what I would've played to.  Why, while not that effective, there is technically a fork then on the Q and N, and when white gets out of it with Qc2 the position is a little crammed, since the Q and N,s appeared lopped up against one another.  What I recently learned is that having a crammed position like that, gives the opponent a slight advantage.} 26. Nf4 {I like this response for the reason I outlined earlier, regarding the crammed position.} Rd4 {! Yes, and now black plays what I noted a move ago.} 27. Qc2 {! A very good way to get out of the situation.  And, absorb that with this move, given that white's N is not on d3, the position isn't crammed.  With that, it's starting to get very interesting and complicated.} a5 {The idea behind is to exchange.  And, yes, I like this move a lot, and in fact, what I would've done as well.  I like the exchange variation.} 28. b5 {! Surprisingly, white doesn't allow it.  I used to view as an inaccuracy.  That was, until I studied about pawn structures from WB, and what I learned is that away from the center, when the opponent goes after a pawn like that, instead of taking, better is usually just to advance it forward, as white just did.  In this case, yes that is the idea.} Be7 {Of course, putting pressure on it.} 29. Ne2 {My next move would've been 29.b6 to strengthen that pawn structure.  But, I like this move even better, though simply because if you advance that pawn on the 6th rank, black cans still stop the passed pawn with 29...Qc6  With this move, however, that is no longer feasible.} Rd5 {Ok, very conventional adding pressure right to the c pawn.} 30. Rec1 {! The response, however, is very good.  This is the kind of thing that occurred in a game between GM's Judit Polgar and Anand.  Now, Anand put a lot of pressure on a pawn like that, and to protect JP put the Q right in front of the R, similar to the position we have here.} Rad8 {Ok.  What's good is that black is doubling up, which as we know, doubled rooks are dangerous.  However, in this position, I would've played 30...Rac8 for the same reason I outlined, with the mounted pressure on the c pawn.} 31. Rb3 {Since white is not going to double up with 32.Rc3, I don't know why this was played.  That's what I would've done.  So, now I would've played 31.b6 preparing for 31...Bxc6, so that the N could jump right in action with 32.Nxc6} g5 {!? When you have doubled pawns away from the center, as is the case here, the idea is to advance one of them so that they could be traded.  This is what Jack typically does, when his pawns become doubled, and I learned that exact lesson from him.  However, this is an inaccuracy, according to the analysis.  According to them, black's best move was 31...Nd4  Then comes 32.Nxd4, Rxd4 33.c6, Rxa4 34.b6, Qxc6 35.Qxc6, bxc6 36.b7, Rxe4 37.b8=Q, Rxb8 38.Rxb8+, Bf8 39.Rxc6, a4} 32. h3 {!? Idea is to exchange, but this is risky, in my opinion because, since it's not an endgame, the K is now at risk of exposure because there are pawns that have advanced right near it, so the monarch has less protection now.} f6 {?! Possibly to get connected pawns.  Is so, the plan is a little risky for, more or less, the same reason.  As I learned, sometimes pawn structures are brilliant, whereas, in other cases there blunders.  I wouldn't call it either or, but closer to a blunder as it's a little bit risky.} 33. Kh2 {With what I noted, I don't understand this at all.} Kf7 {Also don't know why black played this, either.} 34. Rc3 {! At last, white plays the move that I noted earlier.  And, with it and given that they're one space apart, white has a noticeable advantage.  However, I would've quick played this immediately.  That is, on the 31st move.} Kg8 {What this move proves is what I mentioned, that black wasted time with his last move.} 35. Kg1 {Now making use of the opposition.  Although, that would apply in the endgame, but still I guess that it would be good to do something like that.  The real question is why move the K so early?  } Kf7 {Not an inaccuracy, but because of what I asked, I'll call this move a waste of time.} 36. Rc4 {! On the one hand, I like where that R was.  On the other hand, I really like this move.  The reason is because it allows white to still go for b6 but with better results, this time then what I noted earlier.  After he does, and suppose that black responds with ...Qb8, white now has a dangerous passed pawn.  Could play c6, with the idea that black just takes it, and then white can advance that b pawn even further.} g6 {! What I noted earlier, regarding doubled pawns, is exactly why I also would've played this.} 37. Qb2 {! Adding pressure on the b file.  While I also liked it when the Q was on the c file, this just adds one more defender to the b pawn, should white ever decide to advance it.} Rd5d3 {Don't understand what this move accomplishes.} 38. Qb1 {But, a good way to exploit the weakness that black created.  Now, this gains valuable time for white.} Rd3d5 {! The only way to protect the R. 38...R3d7, looks good to but isn't because of 39.c6, bxc6 40.bxc6 in which black still loses the R.} 39. Kg2 {Still don't know why white keeps advancing his K.} Kg7 {Well now, black has opposition, which is something that I will keep emphasizing in this annotation since it is a very important concept.} 40. c6 {! Trying to win an exchange.} b6 {With him strengthening his pawn structures, black won't allow this.} 41. Rh1 {! Adding protection to the h file.} Kf7 {Don't understand why he played this.} 42. h4 {!? Don't know why he played this because there's not going to be an immediate exchange, yet.  And, if there was, meaning that he'd take back with 43.gxh4 I would give this move an !  But, since not, I call it dubious because I don't know what it accomplishes.} gxh4 {As anticipated.} 43. Ne4c3 {?  I understand the idea behind it, I think anyway.  The idea is pressure on the center.  But, according to the analysis, it is a mistake.  I agree with that.  I would've played the immediate 43.gxh4, but what the computer says is even better, as not only just exchanging, but winding up a pawn ahead.  What they suggest is 43.g4, with the idea of 43...Ng7  And, now, 44.N4c3, f5 45.Nxd5, exd5 46.Rf4, Bg5 47.Rf3, Kg8 48.Rfh3, Re8 49.Qd3, fxg4 50.Qxd5+, Kh7} Re5 {?? Another mistake, according to the analysis because of how white responds.  And, since it is the last mistake mentioned in the analysis, I'm going to say that this is this losing blunder.  Instead, best was 43...Rd3  Then 44.gxh4, Bb4 45.h4, g5 46.Rd1, Rxd1 47.Nxd1, Bc5 48.Ng3, Rd2 49.Ne4, Nh4+ 50.Kh1} 44. g4 {Ok, mounting pressure still, but I just would've taken with 44.gxh4, given that he would not retake with 44...Nxh4?? because of the h R.} Ng7 {? Understandable, but I would've gone on the offense, and retreated with 44...Nd6  The idea, is as I read in charleshiggie annotation and then did with Jack with astonishing results, isn't attack, per say, but when you retreat and get out of danger, you do so with a counterpunch, by reattacking.  It makes it so that the opponents plan does not work.  That's the idea behind it.  And, it most certainly would've protected the h pawn, for now.  And, with it, this move is a mistake because white regains the pawn immediately with his next move.} 45. Rxh4 Rc5 {The idea is exchange, which will happen.} 46. Rxc5 bxc5 47. Rh7 {! Yes, this is exactly what I would've played to, pinning that N directly.  Note: I did this in quite a few games, including my game against Jack a couple of weeks ago.  No absolutely guarantees, but more often not, I've won several games by directly pinning the N, like this.} f5 {Ok, but not the best move.  The idea is force the exchange, which in general, I do and how, back in the day, I would've done..  But, I would've played 47...Kg1 to undue the pin, whilst, going right after that R.  Not the very last one, but the game prior, this is exactly what Jack did, when he was pawn ahead, and doing so increased his advantage more and more until it became overwhelming for me.} 48. gxf5 gxf5 49. Qh1 {! While it might not appear so, at last, I understand something that I wouldn't have several moves ago.  The idea behind this isn't easy, but to put more pressure on that N, and force black to do something to avoid a checkmate with Qxg7#  It's a good plan here because by making things difficult on black, white should have an overwhelming advantage, from here on in.} Rg8 {Of course, it's not so easy, as we know.  But, what it shows is that black is thinking ahead, as well, which is very important.} 50. Qh5+ {So, white comes up with another plan, given that the N is pinned.  And, the way to remember is, "There is always another of doing things", as chesskingdom64 puts it.} Kf8 {! Correct.  The only other choice was 50...Kf6, but then, white mates after 51.Rh6+, Ke5 (forced) 52.f4#  So, this is the best move.  Having said that, this is also what I would've played, as well and for the exact same reason.} 51. Qh6 {So, white now devices another plan to force the win.} Bd6 {In my opinion, this move was not necessary.  Maybe, he was worried that white would mate instantly, but that R prevents white from playing 52.Qxg7#, as without it, this would be mate.  Instead, I would have advanced the pawn right away with 51...e5 with the idea of connecting them with 52...e4, this would be my plan, as black.} 52. Nb1 {This time, I have no idea why white played this.  My next move would've been to attempt an exchange, with the idea of putting the monarch in an uncomfortable, so I would've played 52.Rh8, in this position.} Kf7 {Of course, black sees that possibility, and therefore plays this, which is exactly how I would've responded in this situation.} 53. Nd2 {Like before, I don't know what this move accomplishes.  Instead, I would've immediately played 53.Qh5+, kind of similar to what happened before, as the N is now pinned, again.} Qd8 {To reduce the trouble that black is in, given that now white can't get an even exchange with Rh8.  However, it is too little, too late for black as the damage has been done, and white has more then one way to win, as we're about to see. } 54. Nc4 {Now, I understand why he played Nd2  Had to be the plan, all along.  He's achieving a strong N pair to exploit black's weaknesses.  As it turns out, he was repositioning his N's, for a long while.} Bb8 {However, I don't know what this move accomplishes.  But, no matter what, white has the winning advantage.  As Ted says, "The end is near."} 55. Nf4 {Also why Ne2 makes sense, as well since white was repositioning that other knight, in addition.  } Qf6 {But, this move will help a little.  Bringing the Q for protection which is exactly what Jack did a couple of times, and what Tom did once, to drive off a mate threat, which was very difficult to do so.  Of course, I miscalculated, one thing because it appeared that they would lose something, but putting the Q out, like that, prevented that.  But, not this time because white forces the exchange, here.  And, afterwards, white will have a threat that can no longer be driven off.} 56. Qxf6+ Kxf6 {And, now what is black to do?} 57. Kf3 {! Instead, I would've played the immediate 57.Rh6+, followed by bringing one of those N's on the 6th rank, making it very dangerous for black.  However, the move played is just as good and effective as white has the opposition, but even better now, then it were before because black cannot get out of trouble.} e5 {Now, we can say that black no longer has a defense so he might as well do anything.  I will generally think defensively here, but there is nothing that black can do.} 58. Rh6+ {And, with it, black resigned here.  For a while, I couldn't figure this out, as I would've played on.  Yes, he could get out of check, but mate is soon to follow with those Knights.  Plus, white will just keep ganging up, so with no way out of it, black waved the flag.  }
