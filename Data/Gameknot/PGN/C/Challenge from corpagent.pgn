1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Protecting the pawn.} 3. c3 Nf6 4. d4 {Instead of defending you attack, a perfectly good strategy.} exd4 5. e5 {Pressing the attack.  This will help you develop your position without sacrificing material.  Good strong opening.} Qe7 6. Qe2 Nd5 7. Na3 dxc3 8. e6 {This pawn was safe where it was.  Now it isn't.} Qxe6 9. Ng5 {Now I am encouraged to swap queens, strengthening that three pawn advantage.} Qxe2+ 10. Bxe2 cxb2 11. Bxb2 Be7 12. Nc2 {Why toss the g5 knight?} Bxg5 13. Nd4 {Better yet would be BxPg7, making back a point while breaking up the black king's pawns.} Nxd4 14. Bxd4 {Now I must protect Pg7.} O-O 15. O-O Nf4 16. Rfe1 Re8 17. Bc3 {Oops, this gives black white's white bishop.  Bc4 would have been better. } Nxe2+ 18. Kf1 {If black moves the knight black loses the game with RxRe8#. } d5 19. g3 Bd7 20. Rxe2 {White should have taken the knight before the black bishop could pin white's rook against his king.} Bb5 21. h4 {Nice response, threaten something else.  In this case the reprieve is only temporary.} Bxe2+ {Rook is worth more than bishop, but the check saves it.} 22. Kg2 Bf6 {Tome to trade more.} 23. Rc1 Bxc3 24. Rxc3 c6 25. Rc2 {White decides to gang rape the a2 pawn.} Bc4 26. g4 Re2 27. Rc3 Rxa2 28. Rf3 {White wonders if he will have a second chance to play pin the rook on the king.  Probably not.} d4 29. Rf4 {Not. Good to pressure the pawn, though.} Bd5+ 30. Kg1 d3 {}
