[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation, Steinitz counter-gambit (D00)"]

1. d4 {Unusual for the time.} d5 {QP openings were rare enough in 1770. This is the only response.} 2. Bf4 {An unusual variant.} c5 {Like the Queen's Gambit, with colors reversed and a move behind.} 3. Bxb8 {Not a good move, exchanging a developed piece for an undeveloped one.} Rxb8 {Forced.} 4. e3 {Securely guarding the QP.} e6 {Opening a line for the KB.} 5. c3 {Locking in the strong point at Q4.} b6 {Adding support to *his* Pawn structure.} 6. Qa4+ {Extremely premature. The minor pieces should be developed first.} Bd7 {Countering with a threat. White's best plan is to retreat and develop.} 7. Qxa7 {This Pawn snatch is horrible. The Q is exposed to great danger.} c4 {Blocking a retreat along the QR6-KB1 diagonal and opening an attacking lane for the KB.} 8. b4 {Hoping to retreat via QR3 and QB1. But...} Ra8 {Black cuts him off at the pass.} 9. Qb7 {The Q is trapped on this square like a fly on fly paper.} Ne7 {Threatening B-B3 winning the helpless Queen.} 10. b5 {Preventing the Bishop move. But...} Nf5 {White resigns. 11... N-Q3 cannot be stopped, and the Queen falls.}
