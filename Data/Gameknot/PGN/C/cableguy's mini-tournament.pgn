1. e3 {My old start out.} e5 {Expected e6 but o well.} 2. Qh5 {Move queen out for 2 possible moves: 4-move-checkmate OR black g6 then take pond, check him, and take rook.} Nh6 {Black doesnt do what I was hoping for.} 3. d3 Bd6 {Allows development and protects e5.} 4. e4 {Allows development and stops e5 pond from moving foward.} Nc6 5. Bxh6 {Takes knight and doubles the pond.} gxh6 6. Qxh6 Bb4+ 7. c3 {A simple block but  think I would have been better moving my knight to c3 or d2.} Ba5 8. b4 {Pressuring a5.} Bb6 9. b5 Na5 10. Nd2 {Somethings I froget what I was doing.} c5 11. O-O-O {Queen side castle, although I think it would have been better to do king side castle because its more protected.} d6 12. Nc4 {Forking bishop and knight,} Nxc4 13. dxc4 {Doubling my pawns and capturing the knight. I guess it wasnt such a brilliant idea.} Bg4 {Threatning rd1} 14. Qg7 {Forking the rook at h8 and bishop at g4. } Rf8 {I would have took the rook with my bishop but instead he messes up his king-side castling.} 15. Qxg4 f6 {Allowing small development of rf8 but blocking off the queen.} 16. Qe6+ Qe7 {Blocks check with queen but messing up all his castling as well.} 17. Qxe7+ Kxe7 18. h4 {Allows development... I think thats what I was doing...} Ba5 {Threatning c3.} 19. Rh3 {Protects c3 aand the whole row.} h5 {Random thing.} 20. Rg3 {¿¿¿¿¿ } b6 {Makes the game an even more of a closed game.} 21. Rg7+ {Pressuring the king.} Ke6 {I would've moved it back into the 8th row.  He's just putting his king in more danger.} 22. g3 {Allows development of the bishop to check him.} Bxc3 23. Be2 {I wonder why I didnt do it... It could mess up his pond defense system.... AS you see... Im NOT the most brilliant chess player.} a5 24. g4 hxg4 25. Bxg4+ {Finally! I checked him.} f5 {Blocks with pond.} 26. exf5+ {Forced to move to f6.} Kf6 27. Rg6+ {That wasn't one of my better plays.} Kf7 28. Rdxd6 {Finally! The other rook is now in play.} a4 {Another random thing?} 29. Rde6 Rad8 {4 rooks in play now.} 30. Rexb6 Ba5 {Threatens my rook.... Could've done something better.} 31. Rb7+ {Oldfasion way. } Ke8 {Forced to move.} 32. Re6# {And mate! A game of many random,stupid, and some smart stuff.}
