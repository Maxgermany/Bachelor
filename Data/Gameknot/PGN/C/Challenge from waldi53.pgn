1. d4 d5 2. h3 e6 3. g4 Nc6 4. c3 Nf6 5. g5 Ne4 6. f3 Nxg5 {Taking the pawn} 7. h4 Nxf3+ {My knight was basically screwed no matter where he moved, so I decided to just cut my losses and try for another pawn. } 8. Nxf3 Bd6 9. Bg5 f6 10. Be3 e5 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Qxd5 {White gets my unprotected pawn} Nxf3+ {Trading knights} 13. Kd1 {White doesn't take the knight (not sure why)} Ne5 14. Bd4 c6 {Trying to scare away the queen } 15. Qe4 Bg4 16. Nd2 Qd7 17. Kc2 Bf5 18. Qxf5 Qxf5+ {Not sure why White forgot about my queen protecting the bishop} 19. Kd1 Ng4 {Aiming for f2 to trap the rook} 20. Bh3 Be5 {Then I remembered the bishop still covered that square lol, so trying to trade bishops. } 21. Rf1 {White is having none of my sh*t today xD} Qh5 22. Rg1 Nh6 23. Ne4 Qxh4 {Taking the pawn} 24. Rh1 Qxe4 {Taking White's unprotected knight (not sure why White didn't try and protect it or move it away) } 25. Rf1 Bxd4 26. cxd4 {Trading bishops complete} Qxd4+ {Taking the pawn} 27. Ke1 Qh4+ {The other bishop is dead now} 28. Rf2 Qxh3 29. Kd2 Nf5 {Trying to bring my knight back out} 30. Raf1 Qe3+ 31. Kc2 Nd4+ {At this point, I'd like to say that White is focusing too much on offense and not enough on defense. } 32. Kb1 Qe4+ {Checkmate is inevitable, except in one case (which ends with me getting the pawn and one of the rooks) } 33. Kc1 Qc2# {I think White's biggest mistake in this game was that he was maybe a little careless and rushed his moves without thinking about them first. }
