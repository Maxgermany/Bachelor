1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c5 3. d5 e6 {3. ... b5 is the main response, known as Pseudo-Benko. 4. Bg5 Qb6 5. Bxf6 Qxf6 6. c3 d6 7. e4 a6 with unbalanced, but playable position. I played differently, as I was usually play Benoni. On the other hand, I was not aware of pseudo-Benko lines, and did not even consider 3. ... b5.  } 4. Nc3 {Converting to a Schmid Benoni.} exd5 {Again, 4. ... b5 is possible, but now not as favourable for Black. 4. ... exd5 is the main line.} 5. Nxd5 Nxd5 6. Qxd5 Nc6 7. Bg5 {[111 min left] The position seems to require 7. e4 (main response), which blocks d pawn from getting to d5, as well as allows White to develop. Bc4 would come with a tempo (in view of Qxf7 threat). This was the move I expected, to which I would simply continue developing. 7. e4 Be7 8. Bc4 O-O 9. O-O d6, and White faces no problems. Foregoing the strong 7. e4 move looks to be a mistake.} Be7 {[106 min left]} 8. c3 {[111 min left] Odd choice, as c3 does not achieve anything, while it weakens the queenside (in case white wants to castle queenside). 8. Bxe7 Qxe7 9. a3 b6  10. e3 Bb7 11. 0-0-0 0-0-0 (Kalinin (2366) vs. Brzeski (2315)) or 8. a3 0-0 9. e3 d6 10. 0-0-0 seem to be good for white. The key difference between a3 and c3 will soon be seen (c3 permits Bc8-e6xa2, while a3 does not). With white inclined to castle queenside, c3 seems to be strategic inaccuracy.} d6 {[104 min left]} 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 {[55 min left] Computer seems to prefer 9. ... Nxe7 10. Qd3 d6, the point being that 11. e4 now suffers after 11. ... Re8, and if a) 12. 0-0-0, then Be6 13. Kb1 Qa5 14. c4 Rad8 with good play for Black b) 12. Be2 or 12. Rd1 (unpinning the pawn) Ng6! (threatening Nf4), claiming advantage for Black in both lines. I considered both Nxe7 and Qxe7, and settled on Qxe7 with the idea of d6, Be6, and Bxa2 (if Qxd6). I did not consider moving knight to g6 following Nxe7, which I should have.} 10. O-O-O {[56 min left] This move is off the book according to 365chess.com (10. g3 and 10. e3 have been tried), and is not engines top choice (engine opts for 10. e3 and 10. Rd1). The problem with it is that it almost forces black to play Be6 and Bxa2, as d6 is not defendable. Based on the outcome of this forced line, it seems to be a second mistake (after not playing e4 immediately). From this point on black has small but stable advantage.} Be6 {[53 min left]} 11. Qxd6 {[56 min left]} Bxa2 {[51 min left] There is no reason for black to invite white rook to d6 by playing Qxd6.} 12. Qxe7+ {[54 min left] 12. e4 Qxd6 13. Rxd6 Ke7 14. Rd3 (d2 or d1) is also OK for Black.} Kxe7 {[51 min left]} 13. e3 {[51 min left] Engine thinks Black has a small edge regardless of white's move in this position. This seems understandable - black is better developed, and white has some weaknesses on white squares, especially b3. If 13. Nd2 (defending b3), then the rook on d1 becomes inactive. Also, white lacks any attacking ideas, as black seems to have no weaknesses of its own.} Bb3 {[50 min left] asking the rook to declare the intentions.} 14. Rd2 {[50 min left]} a5 {[39 min left] Strong move with a plan! I considered Na5 too, but was afraid that the queenside play of light pieces can be stopped, and then the fight for the d file might lead to the exchange of rooks (not good for the side playing for a win). a5 allows to hope for the opening of "a" file, while Na5 does not. -0.5 according to engine after this move - slight advantage for black.} 15. Bd3 a4 {[36 min left] } 16. Bc2 {[41 min left] Too passive. More active is 16. Bf5! Rhd8 17. Bc2, allowing to exchange a pair of rooks (if needed). } Na5 {[35 min left] Strong move! Strictly speaking there is no need for this move, as Bxb3 axb3 is not good for white. Black's plan now is Be6 with Nb3, forcing Bxb3! Engine concludes this is a good move after some thinking. White seems to have no good counter plan.} 17. Rhd1 {[40 min left] Now, this is a mistake. It was not yet obvious to me, but the problem is that white 2 rooks do not have sufficient number of free squares on d file! Rdd1 (preventing Nb3) was much better. From this point on Black has significant advantage.} Be6 {[34 min left]} 18. Ng5 {White has few alternative moves to choose from. 18. Bxa4? Nb3 19. Bxb3 Ra1 20. Kc2 Bf5 21. Rd3 Rxd1 22. Kxd1 Bxd3 loses the exchange, and likely the game. 18. Rd3 (did not consider it over the board) needs to be countered with Nc4! with the idea of a3 (advantage for Black).} Nb3+ {[32 min left]} 19. Bxb3 axb3 {This position is already very bad for white. This because 20. Rd3 can be met with 20. ... Ra1! 21. Kd2 Ra2 22. Kc1 c4! 23. Rd4 b5!, and now a) 24. Nxe6 fxe6, and white cannot prevent Rha8, b4, Ra1, Rxd1, c3, and pawns queen, as the other rook cannot come to the defense b) 24. Nf3! b4! 25. cxb4 Rc8! 26. b5 c3! (26. Kb1 Rca8 winning) with significant edge for black, or 25. ... Ra8 26 Nd2 Ra1 27 Nb1 Rc8 with significant edge for black.} 20. Kb1 {[23 min left] Loses immediately.} Ra6 {[22 min left] Important move, as 20. ... Ra2? allows white to escape.} 21. Nxe6 {[23 min left] Loses material. 21. Rd3 loses too, after 21. ... Rha8 22. Kc1 Ra1 23. Kd2 Rxd1 24. Kxd1 Bc4! and rook cannot be saved (25. Rd2? Ra1#)} Rha8 22. Rd2d7+ Kxe6 {White resigned, as he loses the rooks after 23. Kc1 Ra1 24. Kd2 Rxd1 25. Rxd1 26. Kxd7.}
