1. e3 {Here, for the OPENING white chooses to play e3. Is this a BEST move? when selecting a BEST move we seek out the CANDIDATE with the most ATTRIBUTES preferably with an ATTACKING ATTRIBUTE if available. If there is no ATTACKING ATTRIBUTE we then seek out a BEST position.  Since COMMON CHESS SENSE would recommend that the CENTRE is one of the most important places on the board then e4 and d4 would be a better placement for the pawn on this turn. In other words, I consider this a PASSIVE move which allows White's opponent to choose freely without any challenge, the response of his choice.} e5 {Black makes a BEST by taking CONTROL of the CENTRE.} 2. d4 {White now CHALLENGES black in the CENTRE. However, if White had originally played e4 or d4 on Move 1 he would not have to CHALLENGE for the CENTRE because he would be FORCING Black to make that play.  Black has a decision to make: Exchange pawns, DEFEND the pawn or move the pawn forward.} e4 {Black has chosen to use a second TEMPI on the pawn. COMMON CHESS SENSE councils that a player should refrain from moving a piece twice if possible in the OPENING phase of the game.  Since the PURPOSE of the OPENING phase is to DEVELOP pieces as quickly as possible to prepare for the MID-game, then TIME or TEMPI is of the essence. Since each move uses TIME then moving a piece twice has used two TEMPI which means that completing the OPENING phase will take more TIME.  Therefore, for this turn EXCHANGING pawns which maintains PARITY with White and EQUALIZES the CENTRE or playing Nc6 or even d6 are more in keeping with the idea of DEVELOPING pieces as quickly or TIMELY as possible.} 3. f3 {Black's pawn is extended into White's territory. Here White has chosen to quickly CHALLENGE Black's advanced pawn. The problem with this move is that it unnecessarily weakens the king-side 0-0 position and takes away a BEST square for the king-side knight.  C4 would have been a better move because it is DEVELOPING; places another pawn in the CENTRE and discourages d5, the SUPPORT pawn for the e4.} d5 {Black plays d5 which is DEVELOPING and influences the uncontested CENTRE d5 square while SUPPORTING e4. Black also has opened both DIAGONALS for his bishops.} 4. c4 {White must decide whether to take e4 or ATTACK the SUPPORT pawn on d5 and he chooses the latter.} b6 {Here, Black errs and loses TEMPI. B6 neither ATTACKS nor DEFENDS. I do not think Black is planning to FIANCHETTO which is a two TEMPI play so he must have another motive in mind.  Better would have been Nf6 as it is DEVELOPING and DEFENDS both CENTRE pawns e4 and d5.} 5. cxd5 {White takes Black's SUPPORT pawn in the CENTRE thereby weakening Black's influence in the CENTRE.} Bd6 {Black misplays. Better would have been Nf6 because it DEFENDS e4 and ATTACKS d5 or Qxd5 which RECAPTURES the pawn and DEFENDS e4. This is another loss of TEMPI for Black.} 6. Bb5+ {White's GOOD bishop is DEVELOPED and places the Black king in CHECK.   The obvious DEFENCE for Bb5+ is Bd7 which either FORCES white to EXCHANGE bishops or RETREAT. If White RETREATS then Bb5+ was a wasted TEMPI. The EXCHANGE of bishops loses a perfectly GOOD bishop with good prospects since it has open access to the white squares.  More to the point would have been Nc3 because it is DEVELOPING, ATTACKS e4 and DEFENDS d5.} Nd7 {Black BLOCKS the White bishop CHECK with the knight; however, by doing so Black PINS the knight and BLOCKS movement of the white-squared bishop.  The better move would have been Bd7 FORCING white to make a decision: EXCHANGE or RETREAT. Instead Black fences himself in.} 7. fxe4 {White takes Blacks' other UNDEFENDED CENTRE pawn and takes complete CONTROL of the CENTRE. White is also up two pawns. Things are looking good for White.} Qh4+ {Black COUNTERS and puts the White king in CHECK and hopes to RECAPTURE e4 (which wouldn't be possible if White had played Nc6 earlier instead of Bb5+). Here the consequence of prematurely moving f3 becomes apparent as White will now lose his ability to CASTLE.} 8. Kf1 a6 {Another error by Black. Black ATTACKS the bishop creating further weakness on his queenside. Further he ignored the opportunity to TAKE e4 and ATTACK g2 and d5 while placing his queen in a CENTRE position. ----- White's response to a5 should be Bc6 which places the white-squared bishop on a POST maintaining the PIN on the knight and ATTACKING the rook at a8. --- A further in-depth reasoning on my analysis: ----- The BEST move for this turn was Qxe4. a TEMPI was expended on the black queen as she took advantage of the kingside vulnerability and placed the White king in CHECK. As such, this was a BEST move for Black with Maximum TEMPI for that turn. White was FORCED to expend a TEMPI and move the king, also a BEST move. As such no gain in TEMPI for either player. Of course since we know the king is not to be MATED then the real PURPOSE of Qh4+ was to reclaim the White pawn at e4. So this is really a 2 part move sequence if you will, that justifies the expenditure of using two TEMPI on the queen. Keep in mind that COMMON CHESS SENSE warns against moving the queen out in the game early, not just because it becomes an object of ATTACK by lesser pieces but following the idea of TEMPI, reveals that each TIME a piece is moved another TEMPI is expended; and the queen can become a target of multiple ATTACKS and consequently ends up moving several times at the expense of DEVELOPING other pieces. This also goes back to the other COMMON CHESS SENSE warning that a player should refrain as much as possible from moving a piece more than once in the OPENING stage of the game. --- Keeping in mind that all moves in chess have a PURPOSE we are actively seeking out the BEST CANDIDATE for move selection on each turn. I can speculate why Black chose to play a3 however we have to first ask if a3 has as many positive ATTRIBUTES as Qxe4. Yes, a3 ATTACKS the White bishop thereby FORCING white to REACT however the negative of that move is that it allowed White to improve the bishop's position without White having to expend a TEMPI of his own (because it was a FORCED move) and it created a further weakness in Black's position. Therefore, due to Black choosing a Less than BEST move and White responding with a BEST move, White gained a further increase in TEMPI = INITIATIVE = ATTACK.} 9. Bc6 {White's bishop seizes the POST on c6, maintains the PIN on the knight at d7 and ATTACKS the rook at a8. White's position has improved while Black must use TIME REACTING to white's play.} Ra7 {Black is FORCED to move his rook to safety.} 10. e5 {White's d4 pawn escapes the queen's sword, advances and ATTACKS Black's bishop.   Board Overview:  Black cannot move the king-side knight; the queen-side knight is PINNED. The white-squared bishop is TRAPPED and unable to move; The black-squared bishop must RETREAT; the queen is out of position. It's only Move 10 and Black is in trouble.  On the other side, white has an exposed king, Two DOUBLED CENTRE pawns and with the exception of the white-squared bishop has no other pieces DEVELOPED. However, because Black lacks TEMPI he cannot take advantage of White's weaknesses.} Be7 {Be7 takes away a square for the  king-side knight and is vulnerable to the advancing white pawns, not that Black has many good options either.   } 11. Qb3 {I don't think this is a BEST move for White here. The only reason I can see for this move is that White plans to play e6 with the plan of winning Black's PINNED knight. However it leaves the White king without a strong protector while the Black queen remains unmarked.  At this point has has control of the game and he would have been well advised to DEVELOP some minor pieces before moving the queen out. Ideally Nc3 or Nf3 would have been better choices for this turn.} a5 {Black is running on borrowed time and needs to come to terms with his present position.  If White is planning to ATTACK the knight then he needs to assess what his options are.  As long as the knight is PINNED, the knight is in jeopardy. Therefore it follows that the reason for the PIN needs to be resolved OR, the cause of the PIN needs to be addressed.  Kf8 breaks the PIN or Bb7 ATTACKS the bishop.  A5 has to be an error as it lacks the ATTRIBUTES of either Kf8 or Bb7 nor does it immediately act on the on-going situation at hand. I suspect Black has a reason behind the move, maybe even a plan but he lacks TEMPI and without it he will not be able to execute his plan.} 12. e6 {White still refuses to DEVELOP pieces. He has his eye on taking out the Black knight but lacks the back-up to create a DECISIVE assault. With the game under control he could have easily played Nf6 which is DEVELOPING and ATTACKS the Black queen, FORCING Black to REACT and move the queen to another square.  Black is hoping for some COUNTER play and White's failure to take a few moves to CONSOLIDATE his position creates unnecessary risk. Instead White rushes forward planning on displaying the Black knight's armour in his rec room.} fxe6 {Since the assault on the Black knight has begun, Black needs to consider the sequence and how it will play out.  As mentioned earlier, Black has a plan in mind. White can also DEFEND against it. Therefore, instead of playing fxe6 this turn, I would have recommended Ba6+. This move ATTACKS the White king and FORCES White to deploy the knight to Ne2 unless White wishes to lose the queen instead. This would PIN the knight and support Black's intended plan.  On the next move fxe6 would be played.} 13. dxe6 {The pawn that should have died by the queen's sword several moves back now participates in stabbing Black's knight and costing him a piece. Is there a lesson here?  } Bb4 {Black puts his plan into action...prematurely. Black hopes to CHECKMATE the White king. All he needs is TIME on his side; but he lacks TEMPI.  Jeremy Silman, a chess author advises that a player should consider every move that he makes to be visible to his opponent. Black is hoping that White will not see his planned CHECKMATE. BEST Move Philosophy dictates that a player seek out the BEST move for the turn; it never encourages plays that rely on your opponent instantly going blind or stupid. If we are crossing our fingers or making silent prayers in hope that a player will become bedazzled we are no longer playing good chess.  I give black credit for seeing the possible MATE however, his failure to address the gravity of his position may cost a further loss of TEMPI and degradation of his position should his opponent discover it. Although there is a small chance that his opponent may fail to see the attempted CHECKMATE this playing the odds is more akin to gambling than the purity of pure intellectualism that chess is born from.  Again, Black had the opportunity to play Ba6+; Ne2...followed by Kd8 which BLOCKS the further advancement of the pawn and stalls White's ATTACK.} 14. exd7+ {White finally get his man, er knight which was the result and consequence of Black's earlier errors. That being said, White has failed to DEVELOP any other of his minor pieces and once his pawn and bishop are removed from the board he will need to get his other pieces on the board to create a new assault.  White must also address the possible CHECKMATE that Black is hoping, with crossed fingers that White has forgotten about.} Bxd7 15. Bxd7+ Kd8 {Black blunders here and does not take the bishop. I suspect though that Black is a gambling man and hopes that White hastily moves the bishop away and forgets about the CHECKMATE waiting on his doorstep.  Here Black is playing the player rather than the board and rolling the dice. From my experience such tricks rarely work against highly ranked players who tend to play the board than the player.} 16. Nf3 {White's ruse has been discovered and at this point, Black's game should be unrecoverable. Had he earlier played Ba6+ which would have PINNED the White knight at e3 his attempt at CHECKMATE may still have been possible. Now White responds with Nf3 which ATTACKS the Black queen and DEFENDS e1.  As a further note, White needlessly put himself in peril by his reluctance to follow COMMON CHESS SENSE and DEVELOP his knights earlier in the game. Had he done so, Black would have not been able to create any threats, especially one so dangerous as being open to a possible CHECKMATE.} Qe7 {Black withdraws the knight to e7 although Qe4 would have been stronger.} 17. Be6 {White's bishop escapes and ATTACKS the knight on g8. Black now finds himself down a pawn, a knight and a bishop.  Now that the threat of the CHECKMATE has been neutralized NE5 would have been the better move. Ne5 would have made it one of the strongest pieces on the board sitting on a CENTRE POST with no way to chase him away other than by a bishop or knight EXCHANGE. Ne5 would have also preserved a TEMPI because instead of moving Be6, Ne5 would have also served the dual PURPOSE of DEFENDING the bishop on d7.} Nf6 {Black sees the threat to his knight and DEVELOPS it by moving Nf6.  A more aggressive move would have been a4 ATTACKING the queen and over the next few moves advance the pawn PHALANX while still harassing the White queen. This line of play would have also freed the queen-side rook increasing Black's MOBILITY. } 18. Ne5 {The White knight now takes up its rightful POST at the CENTRE. This is a powerful position for the White knight and Black needs to be wary of its next strike.} a4 {Black errs and plays a4 a turn too late. The more pressing issue on this turn is the quadruple FORK by the White knight on e5.  The Black king, queen, rook and bishop are all threatened by the White's knight FORK. Since the king's CHECK must be addressed first, the queen is in jeopardy and needs leave to seek safety. That being the case, Qe8 would PROTECT the queen and also CONTROL c6 the square from which the knight needs to launch its ATTACK. } 19. Nc6+ {White's knight ATTACKS, the king is FORCED to respond...} Ke8 20. Nxe7 {White miscalculates. The correct move was Qc4 moving the queen from danger but still in position to ATTACK the Black bishop.  The sequence should have been: 20. Qc4...b5 21. Qxb5...Qxe6 22. Nxa7+...Kf7 23. Qxb4  White had a chance to make a chocolate souffle; instead he made a mousse of things.} axb3 21. Nc6 {White ATTACKS the rook but to no avail...} Rxa2 22. Rxa2 bxa2 23. Bxa2 Bd6 {After the dust settles White has nothing to show for his troubles and Black has not been routed. Had Black not erred by SACRIFICING his bishop for the risky CHECKMATE his position would have even been more positive. Nonetheless, Black's resolve is given hope...} 24. Na7 {White makes a less than BEST move here with Na7. I suspect this move is to prevent c6 and b5 but this was an unnecessary move. It places the knight on a poor square effectively weakening the knight's influence. The knight at c6 was already acting as a BLOCKER and preventing the c pawn from advancing and it was influencing several squares deep in Black's territory.  Better CANDIDATES to consider DEVELOPING was the queen-side knight still sitting UNDEVELOPED at move 24, moving the king to get the INACTIVE rook into play or Bc6 which would prevent Black from playing b5 effectively shutting down Black's king-side.} Kd7 {Black sees an opportunity to ATTACK the White knight or bishop on the a FILE, so he moves the king to d7 taking a landing square away from the white knight and clears the RANK so that he can bring his rook into play.} 25. Nc3 {White DEVELOPS the knight and DEFENDS a2.} c6 {Rf8 may have been better because it would have given the rook and outlet and access to the board...} 26. d5 {White advances the d pawn effectively preventing a critical assault on the knight on a7.} c5 {White must decide between taking the d pawn or advancing the c pawn. Advancing the c pawn will leave White with one and possibly two PASSED CENTRE pawns...} 27. Ncb5 {I would think White ought to get the knight or bishop off the a FILE. The knight at c6 was well placed DEFENDING d5 and the e4 square and the bishop at a2. Black can still play Ra8 PINNING the knight since the bishop is now UNDEFENDED so I'm not clear on why White just didn't move the knight on the a FILE. } Be5 {Black decides to move his bishop instead of playing Ra8 thereby PINNING the White knight.} 28.
