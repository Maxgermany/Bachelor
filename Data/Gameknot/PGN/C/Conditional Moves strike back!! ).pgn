1. e4 {I used a lot of conditional moves. It drove my friend crazy! :) } e6 {e3, he wants to play it safe. } 2. Nf3 {knight is lookin for a victory........} Nf6 {so is his knight!} 3. d3 {not so fast! } d5 {a little defense! } 4. exd5 {I decide to bite. } exd5 {kings are wide open. } 5. Bg5 {I use this technique a lot. It never seems to work though. } Be7 {See what I mean? } 6. c4 {I decide to get rid of that pawn. } dxc4 {He bites. } 7. dxc4 {Queens are open now. } Bd7 {He decides to play it safe. } 8. Bxf6 {I thought this might be a useful move} Bxf6 {But, it was nothing special. } 9. Nbd2 {I saw his plan. He wanted to take down my rook with no trouble but no! } Bxb2 {he tried....} 10.

Qf3 {I try to sneak this by } Qxd4 {?????????????? You had a rook, and you choose a knight? What about a defense?} 16. Qxf7+ {Check! } Kd8 {Lucky that rook is there. } 17. Qc7+ {This is almost over........} Ke8 {and...............} 18. Qe7# {CHECKMATE! My friend played a pretty good game compared to the others he played. }
