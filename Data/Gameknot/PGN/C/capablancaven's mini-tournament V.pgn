1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 {The English Attack still has some sicilicide virtues. } e6 7. g4 {This move comes in between the standard English Attck plan and the somewhat similar idea of the Keres variation. Contemporary theory indicates that this should be ok for Black, but there are at least two games won by Judit Polgar in this following line (one against Anand), so at first it doesn't seem like such a bad idea to give it a try in the furious complications that steam from the following piece sacrifice.} e5 8. Nf5 g6 {THAT piece sacrifice. It is clear that an knight move will lose the g4 pawn with a tempo, so sacrificing the knight has not only positional and tactical reasons but is also the only way here. Theory gives here Bg2 as the best try for White, but the game will follow an other setup. } 9. g5 gxf5 10. exf5 d5 {The only way. Moving back the knight will get White a huge compensation for the material after something as simple as 10. Bc4, controling the d5 and aiming at the f7.} 11. Qf3 {This is the move used by Polgar. The other move is taking on f6, with complicated game, although it seems that black is not necessarily worst.  } d4 {Now White is a clear piece down. But Black is undeveloped and the advance of the central pawns left his king exposed.} 12. O-O-O {This is the critical position of the variation. There are several options for Black, curiously all involving the only good transit square for his pieces: the d7 point. This position is too much fun to spoil it with my analysis, but you all can work it out why Nc6 or moving the queen is not that great for Black. It will give you an idea of the punch packed in White's setup.} Qd7 {Not entirely sure about that. It looks a bit too forced of a line to give Black more that equal game. But (a) drawing with black is not bad, and (b) forced lines must be worked to the end by BOTH players. Sadly, this is not the case here. } 13. gxf6 Qxf5 14. Qxf5 Bxf5 15. Nd5 {Players have entered in a line of forced moves. } Be4 16. Nc7+ Kd8 17. Nxa8 Bxh1 {What now? Material is equal. But white's knight on a8 is remote, and might get trapped after moves like Nd7 or Bc5, or, in some lines, after the simple b5. The bishop on e3 is also a problem. on the other hand, Black's king is in the centre and the presence of the white pawn on f6  make it dificult to develop and coordinate the pieces. on a more "long term" perspective, the nice pawn centre might fall, togheter with the f6 pawn, leading to a drawish engame.  White has the plan to head for the draw as soon as possible, before Black clears a way for his king. The theme idea is to capture in d4, using the lack of squares of the opponent king, for instance: 18. Bd4 ed4 19. Rd4 Nd7 (forced, Re8 Nc7 # Rc8 Bh3) 20. Bh3 Bc6 21. Nb6. The problem is now, however, 21. Bc5, and Black is winning. Since White could not see a way to make this work (although THERE IS ONE!) he decides to try and better his chances by playing an intermediate move, that seems to lead to an even more forced and beautiful draw, involving, as we will see, the same idea.  Now let us torn to the position after the sacrifice, to show the missed continuation that would have lead to complete equality. After 18. Bd4 ed4 19. Rd4 Nd7 20. Bh3 Bc6 white has 21. b4! Stopping Bc5. But this is not all. Black can try 21... Bh6 22. Kb1 b5 23. Nb6 Kc7 24. Nd7 Rd8 and it will again a piece! Anyway, after 25. Rh4!, white collects the pawns on the kingside and is in time to exchange everything on d7, obtaining an endgame with 3 pawns agains bishop that will be easy to draw.} 18. Bh3 {Now that seems pretty clever. White puts the Bishop in h3 with tempo, anticipating the sacrifice on d4. Now if 18... Bc6, White has the chance to take another look at that sacrifice, and has also other chances. The only problems arise with the tempo-gaining move Bh3.} Bf3 {Now the plan was to sacrifice the bishop on d4, since bishop takes rook offers at least a draw by repetition: 19. Bd4 Bd1 20. Bd6! Re8 21. Nc7 and Na8 back. Of course, White can even try to win after capturing the black knight via a6. The problem is, sadly, that 19. Bd4 can be met by 19...Bh6!+ and if 20. Kb1, after Bd1 the Black king can escape on the kingside. Hence, after Bh6 white faces an endgame an exchange down. Disappointed, abandons the line and moves the rook.  However: with good game, sacrificing the exchange might have still offered good chances to draw, since the Black king is still awkward. Here is a sample: 19...Bh6+ 20. Be3+ Bd1 21. Bh6 Bf3 22. Bd2! (threatening Ba5) Nc6 23. Be3! (now Bb6) and after the almost obligatory 23...d4 24. c3 b5 25. cd ed, white has a nice opportunity to use the f6 pawn to level the chances, with 26. Bh6! Ba8 27. Be6!, and if Ke8 the Rook will be trapped. } 19. Rd2 {In his disappointment, White misses the chance to complicate matters further by playing Rd3. It should be a lesson for you to always try to pin something (if it works). Now black has free hand} Rg8 {Activate the rook and announcing a possible mate in two.} 20. c3 Rg1+ 21. Kc2 Be4+ 22. Kb3 Nc6 23. f3 Bd5+ 24. Kc2 Rh1 25. a3 Na5 26. Bg2 Bb3+ 27. Kd3 Re1 28. Bf2 Rc1 {If you compare this position with that on move 19, it's easy to see that black activated all his pieces, while white's forces are even worse. Now there's no way to avoid loosing material (the white rook has no squares) } 29. f4 Bc4+ 30. Ke4 Nb3 {And White resigned.  Hope you enjoyed this presentation of a typical sicilian, where one should calculate everything correctly till the end before moving. }
