[Opening "Caro-Kann (B13), Panov-Botvinnik, Herzog defence"]

1. e4 c6 {We begin with a Caro Kann - not my favorite.  I hardly ever play the thing, but, looking for a change I had forgotten I had played recently in a Mini-Tournament with precisely this opening (the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, withal).  That MT was not a success for me: 1 win, 4 draws and 3 losses.} 2. d4 {The usual, though 2.Nc3 is quite a good alternative.} d5 {With 2...g3, Black could turn the thing into a Modern Defence.  But this central challenge is the most often played.} 3. exd5 {Exchanging is not the only method.  White also has 3.Nc3 (probably the most popular), 3.Nd2 and 3.e5 (The Advance Variation).  Interesting that these three are the most popular third moves against the French Defence as well.} cxd5 {3...Qxd5 seems pointless.} 4. c4 {This is the aggressive Panov-Botvinnik Attack, a line that has certain affinities to the Queen's Gambit Declined.  This is what I have usually played on the White side (steering for the Gunderam Attack), but here I have the Black pieces.  A good alternative for White is 4.Bd3!? - The Rubinstein Attack.} Nf6 {Also playable is 4....e6.} 5. Nc3 {My favorite line is 5.c5 - the Gunderam Attack.  The idea is at once to establish a Queen side (pawn) majority in the hope of [a] obtaining a past pawn or two  and/or [b] imposing a bind on Black's Q-side.  In the Mini-Tournament earlier mentioned, this didn't work out so well, though a game shortly afterwards (vs veldhuiazaria) went my way after a very tough struggle.} Nc6 {(!?) Herzog Defence.  I know 'Herzog' means 'Duke', but the temptation to an Anglophone such as myself is to mispronounce, just a little: the 'Hedgehog' Defence.   Not that it's very hedgehoggy.  Slightly more usual is 5...e6.} 6. Nf3 {Jo opts for straightforward development, though 6.Bg5 was a good alternative.} Bg4 {Choosing to develop this bishop outside the pawns.  Shortly afterwards I began to have doubts about this, as will be explained shortly...} 7. cxd5 {The motivation for this exchange is not very clear to me.  It does release the tension in the centre, but leaves White with an 'isolani' - an isolated Queen's Pawn - sitting on a file half-open for Black's rooks.  On the other hand there is - or used to be - potential for White to develop a quick K-side attack by bringing the bishops to d3 and g5.   As it transpired, White's pawn structure was of no serious concern until very late in the game.} Nxd5 {Instead, 7...Bxf3 has been tried, but has not, according to the Gameknot World Database, proved very successful for Black.  Far more popular has been this standard recapture.} 8. Qb3 {Now things get interesting.  White strikes at the centre but also towards the b7-pawn.} Nb6 {Cautious, though Black also has it in mind to play...Nxd4 subsequently.  An alternative was ...Bxf3, but, as earlier mentioned I was having doubts about this.  The upside of this capture is the doubling of pawns on the f-file, and White is left with her whole pawn structure shattered.  But I felt that the open g-file and more active game would have gone a long way to compensate for that.  But without exchanging on f3, the bishop sortie to g4 seems lacking in purpose.  So maybe ...e6 ought to have been played instead of ...Bg4, and then deploy the piece to d7.} 9. Be3 {White still has a range of options: 9.Ne5 or, most often played, 9.d5.  Against the pawn advance, though, Black's record has been quite good.} Bxf3 {(!?) A big decision.  Fact was, I couldn't find anything better, and this exchange, damaging to White's structure as it is, makes a lot of sense.  But I felt that White received rather less harm than it looked by this; the bishops being very mobile pieces, and Black's position on the Q-side looking rather fragile.  Incidentally, according to the GK engine, we has departed from 'the book' a move back, but all this had been played before.  As it turned out, we would transpose back in the 'book' a move later...} 10. gxf3 e6 {'Book'.  But I seriously considered 10...g7 here.  This would have gone some way to neutralise the g-file, but I was worried that it was too slow.  Of course, if I wanted to develop the bishop, scarcely any other move came into consideration.  But it is already late in the day for mobilizing Black's King side...} 11. O-O-O {Annoyingly good, but there was no way to stop this.  White's King position looks pretty loose, but Black has no attack.   All the same, I felt that 11.Rg1 would also have created difficulties for Black.} Be7 {Finally running out of Book.  The game is too close to call here.} 12. d5 {(!)  Breaks up Black's Q-side projects.} exd5 {I spent a lot of time thinking about 12...Nxd5.  The few times it has been played in games on the GK Database, have all ended in draws, and it seemed to me that Black's prospects of getting anything better were pretty slender.  So: stay with the obvious and popular.} 13. Bxb6 {(?!) The GK engine misliked this, suggesting instead 13.Nxd5 Nxd5  14.Bc4 Qc7   15.Bxd5 0-0  16.Kb1 Rad8  17.Rhe1 Bf6  18.Bc5 Be7  19.Bxe7 Nxe7.  Also coming into consideration was 13.Rg1, a move Black always had to watch out for.  Interestingly enough, the Database indicated that 13.Bxb6, as played, was the more successful in actual play.} Qxb6 {Taking with the pawn was an option, but I felt that White really did get an edge after that.  Now, Jo's rating is about 150 or so points below mine, but she has improved greatly over the last couple of years or so.  Against such a player, I'd rather keep things level with a high 'risk' of a draw than unbalance things with a significant risk of a loss.  Admittedly, this makes the game, win, draw, or lose, less interesting (sorry), but perhaps more can be learned from it.  At any rate, I've never taken Jo lightly, and I'm not about to start!} 14. Qxb6 {Not unexpected.  To decline the exchange now would probably have presented Black with a tempo, the initiative, and the edge.  E.g. 14.Qxd5 Rd8  and now [A] 15.Qb5 Rxd1ch 16.Nxd1 (seems better than Kxd1) 16...Qc7  17.Ne3 0-0  18.Nd5 Bg5ch 19.Kb1 {not 19.f4 Bxf4  20.Nxb4 Nd4ch 21.Qc4 Qxf4ch and [AA] 22.Kd1 Rd8 or [AB] 22.Kb1 Qe4ch} 19...Qe5  20.Bd3 Rd8  21.Nd3 Qxb5  22.Bxb5 Ne5  23.Be2 Bf4 and a siege begins against the f-pawns; or [B]  14.Qe4 Rxd1ch  15.Nxd1 0-0  16.Qg4 Rd8  17.Be2 Nd4 with an attack.} axb6 15. Nxd5 {15.Rxd5 would have kept the a-pawn.  Surprisingly, no one has tried it, though there seems to be nothing against it.} Rxa2 {Here 15...Bd8 has been tried (to preserve the bishop and avoid too much simplification) but it led to a draw.  I preferred the 'main line', come what may.} 16. Kb1 Ra5 17. Bb5 {(!) A very neat tactical shot, even if it had been played before.  Not only is the bishop protected by a threatened fork (18.Nc7ch), but Black can not castle, neither, on account of 17... 0-0  18.Bxc6ch bxc6  19.Nxe7ch etc; or 18.Bxc6 Bc5  19.Bxb7 Ra7  20.Bc6 Bxf2, when Black doesn't have enough for the piece.  What to play then?  } Kf8 {(!?) The Database had 2 games with 17...Bh4 for a win and a draw.  Tempting, except that I felt that the draw had been too easily reached by White.  The move I chose has a far less impressive scoreline: 3 draws only from 4 games; no wins.  Yet it seemed to me that the draws weren't quite so easily arrived at - there was more play in the resulting ending - and that Black could make something of an attack upon White's f-pawns in a double rook ending.  Nothing solid, and in any case I was already just about prepared to write this game off as a rather uneventful (give or take White's 17th move) draw.} 18. Nxe7 Kxe7 19. Rhe1+ {We haven't reached 20 moves yet, and it's already an end game - or will be very shortly.  Salo Flohr used apparently to describe as 'titanic struggles' the games of Grandmasters that featured a series of even exchanges until the handshake over the bare Kings remaining on the board.  For the spectator - who may have paid money to see the giants have at it - the absence of struggle would have come as more than a disappointment.  At this point, I rather thought this game was going the same way, and was regretting my choice of opening.} Kf6 20. Rd6+ Kg5 {(?) Although the Machine (the Gameknot Engine) misliked this in favour of ...Kf5, I chose this deliberately to provoke the rook check on the g-file.  Oddly enough, the Database had just one example for each move, ...Kg5 leading to a draw, ...Kf5 to a defeat!  I felt that for the loss of my own g-pawn my King would get in amongst his f-pawns, and it would be White who would have to look for the draw.  Let's see how it panned out.} 21. Rg1+ Kf4 22. Bxc6 bxc6 23. Rxc6 Kxf3 24. Rxg7 {All this, with a slight change of move order, has been 'predicted' in the GK Engine's post-game analysis, including Black's next... } f5 {(!) Away, Torpedo One!  Upon this pawn were pinned my hopes of a win.  Of course such a hope was fairly slender; White ought to draw fairly comfortably.  But it's not a gimme!  Even a stroll through the park requires a little exertion.  But as far as I was concerned, I had the initiative; that was enough for me.} 25. Rxb6 {(!?)  I believe it was here that Jo announced she was departing from known games.  Was this a mistake, then?  No: objectively, this capture is fine.  No damage to Whit's game here.} Kxf2 {Obtaining a passed pawn.  Probably White should now begin placing her rooks behind it - 26.Rf7 Kf3 27.Rbf6 Ke4.  This was what I had anticipated, but it isn't easy to see how Black can progress against accurate defence.  But that's OK.  Playing for the win I was, but the way the game had been going, and was like to go, I was figuring on a draw anyhow.} 26. b4 Re5 {The right square for the rook.  All the e-file squares in the opponent's half of the board provide a safe haven for it.  Meanwhile, I was not going to worry my head over White's b-pawn...} 27. b5 {(?!) During the game I thought this was a slip by White.  That White ought to start placing her rooks on the f-file was becoming a matter of urgency.} f4 {Stealing a march.} 28. Rbb7 {(?) Although the Engine's analysis passes this without explicit comment, I thought this was a mistake.  Jo has much the same plan as I did: push the pawn to promotion and see where it leads.  But there is a critical difference between the two sides.  Black's King is right up at the sharp end where he can guide the lowly peon to greater things; the White King still on the back rank, leaving his peasantry to their own devices....  One feels there is a political parable somewhere in there... :-)} f3 29. b6 Rf8 {(!) 'To whom that hath, shall be given; to who that hath not, shall be taken away.'  Forget your political parables! Black abandons the h-pawn to force through the f-pawn.  Black must have the advantage now!} 30. Rgxh7 {(??) This has to be the losing move.  No doubt Jo thought she had enough counter-play not only to hold, but even to offer winning chances, especially as she is now a pawn ahead.  It doesn't work out that way.  Instead, the King had to come into the action, though Black (with care) can maintain an edge: 30.Kc2! Rf6! {Not 30...Ke2  31.Rbe7 Re3  32.Rxe3ch Kxe3  33.Re7ch and now  [A] 33... Kd4  34.Rd7ch Kc5  35.b7 f2  36.b8=Q Rxb8  37.Rf7 Ra8  38.Kb3! (Not 38.Rxf2?? Ra2ch!) and the endgame peters out to a draw; OR [B] 37...Kf2  38.b7 Kg2  39.Rf7!! Rb8  40.Rg7ch Kxh2  41.Rxh7ch Kg2  42.Rg7ch Kf1  and 43.Kd3 or Rf7 hold the draw easily}  31.Rgd7 Rc6ch  32.Kd3 Re6  33.Rxh7 Rd6ch  34.Ke4 Rxb6  35.Rxb6 Rxb6  36.Rf7 Ke2!  37.Re7 f2  38.Kd4ch  Kf3  39.Rf7ch Kg2  40.Rg7ch Kxh2  41.Rf7 Kg2  42,Rg7ch Kf1  43.Kd3 Ke1  44.Re7ch Kd1  45.Rf7 Rd6ch  46.Kc4 (46.Ke3 Ke1) 46...Rd2  47.Kc3 Ke1 and now the only way to prevent promotion is to give up the rook.  You can see from this that there is some intricate manoeuvring Black has to undertake to bring home the pawn after 30.Kc2!   } Kg1 {(!) By far the best move.  The thing is, it took me a while to find it.  My first thought was 30...Rf6, and it is quite a good 'second best' move - good for a big advantage, at any rate.  But I wanted to 'fast track' the pawn's career, looking at ...Ke1 or ...Ke2.  Turns out that Black can resist quite strongly against those lines.  It was only after considerable thought, I hit upon the paradoxical idea of moving the King to the unguarded file.  The King heads for an underground bunker at h1, impervious to White's rook bombardment.  What was wrong with 30...Ke1/Ke2, then?  White would probably have responded with this: 31.Rbe7 Rxe7  (forced: 31...Re8 32.b7! would have been disastrous - a WIN for WHITE!)  32.Rxe7ch Kd2  33.Rd7ch Ke3  34.Re7ch Kd4 (ducking by 34...Kf2 is good for White after 35.b7; nor is 34...Kf4 any good after 35.b7 f2?? {35...Rb8 holds the draw} 36.Rf7!!ch Rxf7  37.b8=Qcheck! giving White a likely win) 35.Rd7ch Kc5  36.Rc7ch Kxb6  37.Rc1 f2  38.Rf1 Kc5  39.Kc2 and White has the safe draw.} 31. Rbg7+ {This rook was chosen to check as it freed the b-pawn to advance.} Kh1 32. Rgf7 {Has she halted the f-pawn's progress, then? ...} Rf5 {(!) Not a chance!  Note that Black ignores the threat behind White's b-pawn in the interests of reinforcing with all the strength available the f-pawn - the key to the game.} 33. Rxf5 {I don't know what Jo's state of mind was at this point.  I guess she had to try this, as 33.Rd7 (preferred by the GK Engine) was a surefire loss of a rook for pawn, and the game with it.  Possibly she still thought she had a chance, as her pawn will be the first to promote!} Rxf5 34. b7 {Lunging forward.  Possibly she was hoping for this: 34...Rb5ch?  35.Kc2 f2  36.Rf7 and a draw.  That ain't gonna happen!} f2 35. b8=Q f1=Q+ {...with check!  At this point, it was obvious that after  36.Kb2 Black could choose to play 36...Rb5ch; or 36.Ka2 Ra5ch  37.Kb2 Rb5ch; either way, winning Queen for Rook.  I did spend some time wondering whether to play that line, though I more than half expected White to play 36.Kc2 to avoid that exchange.  As it transpires, winning the Major Exchange would have been the way to go for Black: 36.Ka2 Ra5ch  37.Kb2 ...{not 37.Kb3 for obvious reasons!}  37...Rb5ch  38.Qxb5 Qxb5ch  and now [A]  39.Ka2 ... {he can not land on a3 or c2 without a K-R fork}  39...Qd2ch  40.Ka1 Qd1ch  41.Kb2 Qd2ch  42.Ka1 Qc1ch  43.Ka2 Qc2ch  44.Ka3 Qxh7; [B]  39.Kc3 Qc5ch  40.Kb2 ... {40.Kd2 Qd4ch 41.Kc1 Qc3ch}  40... Qb4ch  41.Ka2 Qd2ch  42.Ka1 Qc1ch as in [A]; and finally [C] 39.Kc1 Qc4ch goes straight into [B].  The point of showing these lines is that after 36.Kb2 or Ka2, White loses the major exchange - Queen for Rook - and can not avoid running sooner or later into a K-R fork by the Queen.  But White chose to avoid the exchange of Queen for Rook...} 36. Kc2 {But as it transpires, from a purely objective point of view, this incurs worse...} Qc4+ {It's mate in 4:   37.Kd2 Rd5ch  38.Ke1 ...{or 38.Ke3 Rd3ch etc) 38...Qe4ch 39.Kf2 Rd2ch  40.Kg3 Rg2#;  37.Kb1 Rf1ch  38.Kb2 Rf2ch and mate next move.  White resigned: 0-1.  }
