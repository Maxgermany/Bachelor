1. e4 {This is another game that I played against my friend superninja12. In this game, you will see alot of inaccurate play from the both of us. We both made alot of mistakes, but it made the game more fun and interesting.} c5 2. Nc3 g6 3. f4 Bg7 4. Nf3 e6 5. d4 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nc6 {I started with the grand prix, but sort of transferred into the Sicilian main line.} 7. Be3 Nge7 8. Qd2 Qb6 9. Nf5 {Better is 9. Nxe6!} Bxc3 10. Ng7+ {Better is 10. Qxc3} Bxg7 {Better is 10...Kg8} 11. Bxb6 axb6 {He has three minor pieces to my Queen.} 12. c3 O-O 13. h4 f5 14. e5 h6 15. Be2 g5 16. hxg5 hxg5 17. g3 Nd5 18. c4 Ndb4 19. a3 Na6 20. O-O-O Nc5 21. Qc2 d5 22. b4 {Alot better was 22. cxd5} Ne4 23. cxd5 exd5 {23... Nxg3? is alot worse, as he would give up both Knights for a Rook.} 24. Rxd5 Nxg3 25. Bc4 Nxh1 26. Ra5+ Be6 {??? He should have just let me get the Rooks with 26...  Rf7. While he would lose that way, it is better than what happens now.} 27. Bxe6+ Kh8 28. Qh2+ {He resigns because all that is left is 28... Bh6 29. Qxh6#}
