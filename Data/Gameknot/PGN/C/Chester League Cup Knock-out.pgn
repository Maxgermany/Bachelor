[Opening "King's Indian (E81), Saemisch, Byrne variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 {So I start with my usual} 2. c4 g6 {He indicates a King's Indian Defence or Grunfeld.} 3. Nc3 Bg7 {Ah a King's Indian.} 4. e4 d6 {The usual moves} 5. f3 O-O {And I play my favourite Samisch system} 6. Be3 Nbd7 {Solid development by Black, but c5, e5 and Nc6 are more common} 7. Bd3 c5 {I put my trust in devlopment. I saw on the Gameknot World Database that Qd2, Nh3 and Nge2 are actually more common} 8. Nge2 a6 {I indicate a willingness to transpose into the Maroczy Bind, if he exchanges on d4.} 9. Qd2 Re8 {9. Qd2, and I think he was afraid I would play Bh6 and exchange off his lovely dark squared bishop, so he moved his rook so that he can drop his bishop back to h8 if necessary. However in some variations of the King's Indian, the rook is better on f8, to support f7-f5.} 10. g4 e5 {So I decide to advance on the King side. His a6 rather put me off queen's side castling - he can sacrifice a pawn with b5 and get some open files against my king. I was thinking of putting my king on f2 - especially as he had moved his rook from f8.} 11. d5 Nb6 {His e5 took us out of the Opening Databases (not that either of us were using them at the time of course. With my king still in the centre I felt best to close the centre, although I did consider exchanging pawns too. Nb6 looks a dreadful move. It blocks the advance of his b pawn. I think he wanted to give another square to his Nf6 (another downside of Re8 was that he now has less squares for that Knight.} 12. Ng3 Kh8 {Kh8 looks like a mistake too. Why put your king opposite my rook?} 13. h4 Nxg4 {So, rather than go on the defence he sacrifices a Knight for two pawns.} 14. fxg4 Bxg4 {And this bishop is finally developed.} 15. h5 Bf8 {I decide to play h5 before he gets in with h5. I am not sure why he plays Bf8} 16. hxg6 fxg6 {I exchange rather than let his block up the position.} 17. Be2 Qd7 {My Bd3 is not a good bishop, blocked by my own pawns. I decide to exchange it. He correctly protects it with his queen. Maybe I should play Rh4 here, but instead I decided to complete my development with....} 18. O-O-O Bxe2 {and he exchanges} 19. Qxe2 Rac8 {I retake with the queen, to protect the c pawn. I am not sure why he played Rac8} 20. Rdf1 Rc7 {So I grab an open file and prepare to move my Nc3 over to the king side.} 21. Nd1 Na4 {A little sally with his knight....} 22. b3 Nb6 {and it is soon sent back. I think he wasted 2 moves here. b3 was a move I wanted to play anyway, to free my queen up} 23. Nf2 Rb8 {Preparing at last b5} 24. Ng4 Qd8 {and here it comes, although maybe N-h3-g5-e6 was even stronger} 25. Nh6 Bxh6 {He removes the knight, which was threatening Nf7 winning more material} 26. Rxh6 Nd7 {Now I spent a long time here looking on sacrificing my rook on g6 and h7, but they don't quite work, so instead I played...} 27. Qg4 b5 {and he finally starts his counter play. Again I looked at the sacrifices on g6 and h7. At the time I didn't think they worked, and then a move or two later, when it was too late, I realised they did! See http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=33318} 28. Qxg6 Qg8 {But I am winning easily anyway} 29. Rxh7+ Qxh7 {So I take off his queen and pawn for 2 rooks} 30. Rh1 Qxh1+ {He could resign here with a clean conscience} 31. Nxh1 Nf8 32. Qxd6 Rcb7 33. Qxe5+ Kg8 34. cxb5 Rb7xb5 35. Qg3+ Kf7 36. e5 c4 37. bxc4 Rb5b1+ 38. Kc2 Rb8b2+ 39. Kc3 Rxa2 40. e6+ Ke8 41. Qf4 Rb7 42. Bc5 Ng6 43. Qf6 Rg2 44. d6 Nf8 {and another little puzzle has arisen. White to play and mate in 2!}
