[Opening "QGD (D06), Marshall defence"]

1. d4 {Here is a very exciting sacrificial game I won recently. I play my usual Queen Pawn.} d5 2. c4 {My favourite opening for White, the Queen's Gambit.} Nf6 {Black plays the Marshall Defence, as after 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.e4 or 3.cxd5 Qxd5 4.Nc3 then 5.e4 White has superior central control.} 3. cxd5 Qxd5 4. Nc3 Qa5 5. Bd2 {Preparing a cheap discovered attack on Black's queen. I am hoping that this may gain me an extra tempo later in the opening.} e6 6. e4 Bb4 {OK, no more cheap discovered attack threats.} 7. Bd3 {At the moment, I have hopes for e5 to scare the knight away and then a nice Greek Gift Bxh7+!...provided Black castles kingside.} O-O {Excellent <evil laugh>} 8. Nf3 {Preparing the classic Greek Gift checkmating sequence.} c5 9. e5 {Mission accomplished. No way to prevent Bxh7+.} Nh5 10. Bxh7+ {BOOM} Kh8 {!?!?! Snubbed!! I almost consider it bad form to decline such a stylish sacrifice, into which a player has put so much thought! It's time to punish Black for this temerity.} 11. Ng5 g6 {The bishop can't escape...but it's doing a perfectly good job there anyway.} 12. g4 {PAWN STORM!! Time to call in the endless legions...with tempo.} Ng7 13. h4 {The second legionnaire joins the tortoise formation.} cxd4 14. Nce4 {Another unit is coming to help with the attack. The only problem with this is that it allows Black to exchange bishops and queens, thereby weakening White's assault, but I decided that White's powerfully placed minor pieces and pawns, with rooks coming in soon to help, could still win the day.} Bxd2+ 15. Qxd2 Qxe5 {A pawn grab...giving rise to a beautiful forced tactic.} 16. Qb4 {Attacking the rook. If the rook moves, 17.Nxf7+ wins Black's queen. If Black defends it...} Nd7 17. Qxf8+ Nxf8 18. Nxf7+ {...White wins rook for bishop.} Kxh7 19. Nxe5 b6 {Ooops! After all he has been through, Black falls victim to a stylish forced checkmate:} 20. Nf6+ Kh8 21. Nf7# {Cavalry power wins the day. 20...Kh6 21.g5# is equally stylish.}
