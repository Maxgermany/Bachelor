1. e4 {Just like me, this is also ION's, "Best by test."  In all the games that I've played with him, as black, this is how he's opened.} c5 {So, I stick with my usual, as well.} 2. Ne2 {This move, however, took me off guard.  As just like what I was learning with Ken in our second game, I'm now in unfamiliar territory.  The most common move 2.Nf3, but ION played this instead.  What's more is that I have not seen this played on only the second move.  So, this is already a taste of how intense openings can be.} d6 {Knowing that, I stick with my usual.} 3. Nbc3 {Surprisingly, he brings the other N out.  Well, I shouldn't be surprised as this develops.  But, the reason behind it is that I expected 2.Nf4.} a6 {In case ION's plan is 4.Nb5, I prevent that.} 4. g3 {And, he plays an early K side fianchetto.} Nf6 {So, I continue with my development.} 5. Bg2 {Not surprisingly, he completes that fianchetto.  But, nothing holds me back from continuing with my development, as I bring my other N into play.  It's also worth noting that I'm on the fringe between opening up a line for my Bf8 with an fianchetto, or advancing my e7 pawn.} Nc6 6. d3 {Meanwhile, this is how ION opens up a line for his Bc1.  I am not surprised as it's generally not wise to do a double fianchetto.  I have done that a couple of times but have, except for one or two occasions, gotten myself into trouble, that way.} g6 {After some careful consideration on what to do with my Bf8, I decide to fianchetto.  The reason being is that I don't want to disturb the layout or structures of the Sicilian Defense.  By structures, I am talking about the pawn chain.  As I like the way my pawns are aligned and don't want to change it.  So, I felt that this move was the way to go.} 7. f4 {I have no idea why ION played this.} Bg7 {But, like him earlier, I also complete my K side fianchetto.} 8. O-O {Bringing his K to safety, as expected.} Bg4 {That's when I use the opportunity to pin.  And, now, I can see why ION played 3.Nbc3.  Before, exchanging the N would benefit me since the exchange involves his more powerful piece.  But, his Nc3, however, is just as powerful as his Ne2.  I didn't know that in the beginning, unfortunately.} 9. h3 {Hitting my B.  I didn't know what to do and had considered retreating.  I think this would've been the better option.} Bxe2 {?! On the other hand, I was worried that retreating would allow his Ne2 to become dangerous since the pin would be broken.  I asked myself a similar question to what Ken has told me to ask myself as well as others to ask myself.  That is, what would I do, if ION had the option of something like 10.Qd2, and then 11.f5, with the idea being 12.Nf4.  In other words, what would I do, if he could repost his N to that square, as then it would be dangerous.  By exchanging, I felt like I might have stopped a problem before it started.  Come to think, the N moving wasn't really of a concern, and therefore, I should not have given it too much thought.  Better would have been to retreat my LSB, as it was certainly not worth the exchange given that there's potential for his Nc3 to become as dangerous.  The point is that I might have been use my B at a later point in time, as Ken has mentioned.  I think that what really needs to be worked is exploring my options.  For had I done that, I thought about what those pieces could really do, I wouldn't have made this exchange.} 10. Nxe2 O-O {I also wanted time to castle.  But, this could have been just as soon by retreating.} 11. Be3 {As now, just like me, ION has just completed his development.} Nd7 {In case, ION is planning to make any threats against my c5 pawn, I add another defender.  The more important reason, though, is to discover an attack on his b2 pawn.  } 12. c3 {And, not surprisingly, ION defends.} Qb6 {So, I attack it again.} 13. Qd2 {And, ION defends again.} Nf6 {Given that the attack failed, which I figured it would, I bring my N back to where it was originally since it was a little cramped on d7.} 14. g4 {ION, however, has other ideas since it appears that his goal is to attack it.  So, I bring it back to d7 where that won't happen.  As attacking it appears that attacking it would also give white a better pawn structure being the threat of a pawn chain.} Nd7 15. Ng3 {This is where he is able to repose his N.  Not sure, I ask myself what to do.} Rfe8 {But, nothing else came into consideration, as I figured that the best approach was to centralize one of my Rooks since that is generally the way to go.} 16. h4 {Other moves, however, should've been considered as ION is now breaking through one of those pawns.  At first, I thought nothing of this because defending it would potentially expose the K since preventing this move would mean having had played 15...h5 or 15...f5.  And, I don't like to break open the K, unless it's the endgame.  But, I think it was necessary, in this position.} e5 {Trying to see what I can still do to stop, I use my center pawn.} 17. f5 {But, ION has an answer to that.} Nf6 {Not knowing where to go about, I bring my N back to where it was originally was.  As I am now comfortable that ION has no intention of attacking it.  So, the idea was attacking the pawn, in case, he had plans to break through.  I forgot, however, that the N could still be attacked, but if he did that, however, I'd threaten an exchange with 18...Ng4.} 18. Bh3 {Not chancing it, this is how ION defends his pawn.} Nd7 {Seeing that he could now attack it again, I bring my N back, again.} 19. g5 {Which allows him to break through.  At first, I wasn't afraid since instead of exchanging, I advance the pawn up.} f6 {? But, this is my first mistake because what I didn't realize is that ION is going to win a pawn.  And, when I try to get it back...} 20. fxg6 hxg6 21. Bxd7 {?? ION wins a piece, as I forgot that my Nd7 was en-prise.  Better would've been 20...Nf8, but after 21.gxh7+ Nxh7 or 21...Kxh7 22.gxf6 ION is still a pawn up.  That's because 22...Bxf6?? will also lose a piece because of his Rf1.  But, with 20...hxg6 I am almost ready to resign, and it is, indeed, a resignable position.} Reb8 22. gxf6 {As now, I am down another pawn and for the same reason.} Bf8 {Therefore, given that my B is attacked, I retreat to prevent the passed pawn from promoting.} 23. Be6+ {But, after this check, however, I resign.  My only options are 23...Kh8, or 23...Kh7.  ION has a better position.  Against someone of mine, or even Jack Stockel's strength, I would've continued.  Similar to reversion's open fire, and my games against reversion, the reason I joined this tournament was to learn.  But, there is nothing else to learn here.  And, it's against much stronger opposition.  So, felt that resignation was the best response as playing on would be no way to learn.  In addition, while it's blocked for now, I know that sooner or later, ION will find a way to promote his f6 because I studied a similar example with Coach Stockel.  And, combine his Be6 and Rf1 is more of an example.  Overall, I am happy with this game and feel that I've played better then other games against this opponent.  But, it was the mistake or two that I made, in the end, that did me in.}
