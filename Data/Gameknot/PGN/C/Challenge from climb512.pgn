[Opening "English opening (A16)"]

1. c4 Nf6 {[TR] This is an English Opening (1.c4), and can turn into independent lines only found in the English, or can transpose into one of many different types of KID. If you play 1.c4, your opponent can play 1...c5, and in fact there is a "Symmetrical English" mainline that goes for about 10 moves with Black exactly copying White. Here, if you play 3.e4 then I pretty much have to play 3...d6 (to prevent 4.e5) so this will commit me to some sort of KID setup. If you instead play the "normal" 3.d4 then I have another option in 4...d5, the Grunfeld Defense, which is extremely tactical. Playing 3.Nf3 keeps options open for both sides but also limits your choice of attacks against a possible KID setup (for instance, the Averback Attack would not then be possible for you, but plenty of other stuff would be). After this 3.Nf3 Black could then choose all sorts of other stuff based on 4...c5 (a Benoni or a delayed Benko Gambit for instance. I think Grandmasters like Reti and recent Soviet champion Gulko used to play stuff like 3.b3 here too, but I don't know much theory.} 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 {[DK] I'm weighing d4 versus Ng3. d4 feels good in that I can gain control over more of the center and in response to the impending e4, I have the flexibility of either guarding or pushing d5 to make it difficult for you to develop you queen knight. Also it opens up my bishop file which can lay the groundwork for an attempted exchange with your king-side bishop. I would be a little concerned about defending all those pawns, but not unduly so. Ng3 has the advantage that I can castle sooner, but I don't feel any pressure at all to castle yet, so I think it can wait. I'm not sure if there are other moves I should consider, or lines that I should be looking further down.} 4. d4 Bg7 5. Nf3 {[DK] f4 looks really interesting and supports my tact of building a dominating central pawn wall. It further delays development though and it blocks the c-h diagonal, ruling out a near-term Bh6, so I'm going to stick with this simple development. Actually, I thought we were "out of the opening", but I just consulted the MCO and it looks like this is the standard line which runs very very deep...} O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. b4 Ne8 {[TR]  By the way, THIS is the absolutely critical stage where both players decide on their strategy for the next many moves. Don't just play any old move at this point. You have committed to Qside expansion with the great move b2-b4, and there are many ways to continue, just try to form the long term plan for your piece placement now. I recall that Walter Korn in MCO13 didn't like my move Ne8 here, but I disagree. It has been played by Kasparov and it has many good points; the fact that it doesn't inhibit the c4-c5 advance (like it would on d7) is a weakness, but White can force c4-c5 in any case, so I'm not concerned about that. One setup for White is Be3, Ne1, f3, Nd3 and c5. Another involves Ba3, Qb3, c5 and Nb5. Another is to play on the Kside after f7-f5 by Ng5 and if f5-f4 then Bg4. There are many more as well. } 10. Qb3 { [DK] Okay. Let's start looking for tiny chinks in your armor. Your rook on f8 is terribly immobile. Possibly I could exert pressure on it through the a3-h8 diagonal if I could depose your d6 pawn. Your queenside pawns are a little backward, if I could gain control of the b file and again depose your d6 pawn, placing a pawn on c5 with R on b1, then I could constrict your queenside development (forcing B to guard b7). Your knights are backward. I do not know how to take advantage of this. A pawn on c4 would block all movement for your e7 knight, but not worth exposing my king...} h6 {[TR] That reasoning all sounds good. I'm playing a safe move to keep the N (or B) out of g5, because my plan for playing f7-f5 is messed up by 10...f5 11.Ng5 f4 12.Ne6 BxN 13.dxe Rf6 14.c5 etc. My move ...h6 is very slow and gives you the initiative on the Qside, but it is the safest way to continue a clear plan without making the tactics too muddy. Comming up: Kh8 (getting the K off the White Q's curent diagonal), f7->f5->f4, Rg8, g6->g5->g4, Ne8->f6->h5, Ne7->g6->h4....attack!!!...um, if you don't kill me on the ignored Q-side first :)} 11. c5 f5 12. Ba3 {[DK] I've convinced myself that the crux of my attack must be against d6. If I can unlodge d6 and remount an attack against the center (e5) before your pawns come raining down then I feel I might have a chance. It feels like a race that is critically hinged on timing. I was looking for moves that might hinder your attack, but the best defense I can come up with is a quick counterattack. If I can force you to make defensive moves then your attack will necessarily be slowed.} Rf7 13. Bc4 fxe4 {[TR] I like the moves you are making. Your thinking corresponds to how I understand White's strategy in the KID. the things that are different that I see here are this: Normally, White's K knight moves immediately to allow for f2-f3 strengthening the center. I came very close to switching tactics here and taking in the center, but I want to prepare a little bit more for it. With Rf7 I can close the center (f5-f4) or open it (f5xe4), I block the diagonal between K and Q and I prepare to play the B to f8 where it will eventually help protect d6. ---------------------- Ok, so after your Bishop move I decided to take in the center for various reasons: 1) Because you left the Knight on f3 and didn't try to support the center with f2-f3, my "normal" KID attack of f5-f4 then a pawn storm doesn't really work. 2) Again, due to not moving the Knight from f3, yu have built up a very strong initiative on the Q-side and if I just go about "business as usual" then I am surely going to be behind when the attacks start to show their teeth. Lastly, quiet development by me could have tactical problems (ie, 13...Bf8? 14. Nxe! dxe 15.d6  -).  [DK] That was unexpected. I was planning something along the lines of 13. .. f4, Nc5 _, Nxc QxN, cxd Qxd, b5 Qf6, d6 Nxd, Bxd Qxd, Bxf , although I'm not entirely sure it's sound (not sure if I could have forced regaining material after sac'ing my knight)} 14. Nxe4 Bg4 15. Nfd2 Nf5 16. f3 Nd4 17. Qd1 Bc8 {[TR] This is why my Bishop retreated all the way back to c8 on the last move. I considered that you may have also played Bb2, in which case I needed to retreat the N. I am not working up much counterplay, and I'm afraid that I'll quickly be in a worse position unless I can activate my pieces better than this. My 13...fxe was probably a poor move, as now my structure isn't coordinating very well with my pieces. If your pawn was still on e5 and mine had gone f5->f4 then I would have a much better handle on what's happening here.} 18. Nb3 {[DK] Deferring opening up Qside with cxd. That threat is not going away and the tide of the game is returning to central control (e.g. the long black diagonal). Tactically, if dxN, I will fight for the pawn and threaten your bishop with Bb2. I think I'm okay with a knight exchange followed by fxN. If you do it immediately, then Ne6 _, fxe loses the knight? With no black pawn to block the e file, I can advance and with say Bd3 and Qc2 threaten g5 (which looks hard to defend). Does that seem reasonable?} Nf6 19. Nxd4 exd4 20. Bb2 Nxe4 21. fxe4 Rxf1+ 22. Qxf1 Qg5 23. Qd3 Qe3+ 24. Qxe3 dxe3 25. Bxg7 Kxg7 26. Re1 a5 27. Rxe3 axb4 {[TR] I think the exchanges were probably best under the circumstances--for both of us. This is the position I was playing for when I played the Q check, feeling that I was in a worse ending that I may be able to hold to a draw. You have every right to play for a win, you will very likely come out with a healthy pawn, and my compensation will not be much--I expect to have either a very active rook, or a more active King, and do my best to draw based on this activity. ------------ You played before I could finish and post my comment above. Looks like I may get the active R. If you had played something like 27.cxd cxd 28.b5 then I was planning 28...Kf6 29.Rxe Ke5 holding the R to guard your e pawn and threatening Kd4 with a double attack on both your pieces. This activity was what I was banking on, although it isn't much. Now I hope that my pieces will be able to take up reasonable positions and help me to hold the draw, but I am still not out of the woods.} 28. cxd6 cxd6 29. e5 Ra3 30. Bb3 dxe5 31. Rxe5 Kf6 32. Re4 Ra5 33. Rxb4 Rc5 34. Rb6+ Kf5 35. h3 h5 36. d6 Rc6 {[TR] They're all good things to be considering. On my end of course I am searching for possibilities to draw. These kinds of positions where Grandmasters either resign because they can see it's clearly lost or they agree to a draw because they see it is clearly drawn. Guys like us duke it out just trying to find our way through the minefield of blunders. Here are some things I know about this type of position: 1) If I can trade all the pawns off the board one for one, then I can sac my B for your last remaining "extra" pawn because R B vs R is a theoretical draw (unless my King position is exceptionally bad). 2) The "same-colored" Bishops make it harder for me to draw than "opposite-colored Bishops" would. 3) There are strange material-down endings that I can shoot for in some variations that are theoretical draws....one of these is trading everything off the board except for the 2 Rooks and your a and h pawns, as long as they aren't very advanced I can supposedly hold the draw 2 pawns down. ---------------------------->;I wrote all of that while you were playing 36.d6. This is definitely the move that was coming....I just didn't know when it would come. If you have calculated out a way to push the pawn through, then clearly it is the right move. If not, then it is a very committing move, as now the B cannot defend it anymore on a Black square. I expected Kh2 or Kf2 to be consistent with your h3 move. In one line it makes a big difference: 37.Rb5  Kf6 38.Rd5 Bd7 39.Ba4? at first looks very strong, except for now 39...Rc1  (because the K is still "checkable") 40.Kf2 BxB 41.d2 Bxd2 42.RxB and pawns are now equal.} 37. Rb5+ {[DK] Yes, I was originally going to h3, to avoid exactly the line you pointed out, 39. Ba4? Rc1 , 40 Kh2 BxB!, but this, I believe can be avoided better by 39. Rd1 ... Also moving to h3 opens up possibilities for getting stalemated on h3 or even checkmated on the h file. Furthermore, barring those dark thoughts, it doesn't protect my king as much as I had thought since your pawns can exchange and blow my pawn cover (I think).}
