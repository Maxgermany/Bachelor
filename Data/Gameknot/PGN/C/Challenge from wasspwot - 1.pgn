[Opening "Sicilian (B24), closed, Smyslov variation"]

1. e4 {Being an unrated game against an opponent of what I perceive as equal or greater strength, I throw caution to the wind and open with my king's pawn, knowing an open tactical game will most likely ruin me.} c5 {As expected. I have a long history of facing (and losing to) Sicilians, so I'm already planning my niche Sicilian response.} 2. Nc3 {The closed Sicilian has been an efficient weapon of "ambidextrous" players like Spassky and Karpov, as well as the great precision champion, Smyslov.} Nc6 {I figure I'm in for a drawn out battle. My opponent knows his theory. This is black's most common response.} 3. g3 {I'm merely interested in seeing how much theory my opponent knows. This was a favorite continuation of Smyslov's.} g6 {No surprise here. Black hopes to put immediate and long-lasting pressure on d4. The trade-off is my almost indominatable control of e4.} 4. d3 Bg7 5. Nge2 {Here I break well-established theory. In previous games (my own theory, as it were) once the black king's bishop is fianchettoed the knight at c3 becomes an immediate target for the purposes of doubling my pawns on the c-file and rendering my queen's side indefensible (which is where most of the coming action is likely to take place). As a closed system, I still have plenty of time to develop my bishops and castle, though I must be careful of ...Nd4 which, after the exchange, would place a pawn on the powerful center square.} d6 {He continues development normally.} 6. Be3 {A mistake, if only a small one. Now the black knight can safely traverse to the d4 square without fear of exchange, lest I fork my own pieces in the process.} e5 {A common move to hinder the e2 knight and to make room to develop black's own king's knight.} 7. Bg2 Nf6 {? Not sure about this move as it blocks the bishop and gives the knight minimal options from which to advance. This is the first indication to me that my opponent has not faced many positions like this one in the closed Sicilian.} 8. Qd2 {Assuming (rightly so, as we'll see in a second) that my opponent intends to advance his knight to one of the scant few squares available: g4. My text move here indicates that I'm prepared to exchange the bishop rather than save it (although I exchange it with my pawn structure intact, ha ha!), and I certainly am prepared. In closed positions knights are often more valuable than bishops and this game eventually proves to be no exception.} Ng4 {My confidence always builds in a game when I have correctly guessed my opponent's next move :-)} 9. a3 {I won't call this a key move, but I do think it necessary. Once e3 is exchanged, my queen will be delayed there briefly, leaving c2 unguarded and ripe for attack by the black queen's knight. This slight touch of prophylaxsis is to insure that my queen's side is aired of any immediate intruders.} Nxe3 {Necessary to justify the sorte to g4.} 10. Qxe3 {Kingside pawn structure is preserved.} O-O {Black should be feeling comfortable right now. King is safely tucked away, bishops have good diagonals to work with, Queen has options, rooks will soon be connected. It is my job to dispel this feeling of comfort.} 11. Nd5 {My intention is simple, to show the power of my knights in a closed position.} Be6 12. Nec3 {I relished this move only because I now have my justification for 5.Ng-e2 :-)} Nd4 {! It seems now that a2 may have given too much away. My opponent finds his opening to strike at c2 after all.} 13. O-O-O {!? A dubious move to be sure, but I see this as the best of a bad situation. My king needs fortification, my c2 pawn needs defending, the development of my rooks requires acceleration, and this is the only move that accomplishes all three. The other alternative, 13.Qd2, is unpleasant in the face of 13...Bg4 (that blasted g4 square again!) 14.f3 Be6 in which my kingside is weakened, the a7-g1 diagonal opened for the queen and the bishop to strike if I castle kingside, and eventual confrontation would emerge on the f-file not unlike King's Indian positions where my closed position becomes an open, tactical nightmare. I'd have to castle queenside in that event anyway, so I figured I might as well do so right off the bat without the awful f3 move haunting me the rest of the game.} Rb8 {The dubious nature of my castling choice is immediately revealed. The queen's pawns are coming and they have heavy artillery behind them. My only option is to force my opponent to put out a fire while he is simultaneously starting one.} 14. f4 {The match is struck.} exf4 {A quick puff puts it out.} 15. Nxf4 {That sulfur smell lingers, however, as one demon knight vacates a square to make room for another devil knight to escape to it, hehehe.} Bd7 {My opponent mistakes my meaning. It is clear he understood my move to threaten his bishop, not create luft for my c3 knight. This means he is probably not even considering the knight's presence there. This will work to my ultimate advantage at the end.} 16. h4 {I strike another match.} b5 {He lights his own.} 17. h5 {I give mine a little kindling.} Bg4 {Success! My opponent is once again forced to put out my fire rather than stoke his own. I do not fear the exchange of pawns and pieces on h5 as it will leave his kingside exposed while my king remains comforted in his fort.} 18. Rdf1 {I was planning this move anyway (bringing all pieces to bear on the enemy king's position) and now I have an excuse to do it without making it look like I was planning to all along.} b4 {My opponent is learning from my attacks that his own must take precedent in order to succeed. By this move I had figured a MAD draw (draw forced by Mutually Assured Destruction of both our king positions) was the likely outcome of the game.} 19. axb4 cxb4 {I briefly considered 20.Nb1 in order to prevent penetration by the black queen, but to my own good fortune I hold to my plan of pressing my own attack to avoid doom and evacuate my knight to the square I prepared for him.} 20. Ncd5 {20...b3 is met with 21.c3 and the black knight either goes to c2 winning me a pawn on a7, or he goes to b5 and I'm left with some breathing room to forumlate my next attack. However, the fates conspired in my favor and my opponent's next move left me dumbfounded.} Qc8 {??} 21. Ne7+ {The queen falls.... It is important to note, however, that my king is one move away from checkmate. Had the game continued, and I been too greedy (say for instance 21...Kh8 and then 22.hxg6 threatening a forced mate combination), I could just as easily have lost. Luck only favors those prepared to make the most of it.}
