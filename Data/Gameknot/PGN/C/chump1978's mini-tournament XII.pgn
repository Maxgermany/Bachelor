1. e4 {I am annotated this game to ask others about the position and get feedback. The computer calls a set of moves near end of game a blunder. However, I purposely sacrificed a knight to gain a rook. Please comment on this and let me know your thoughts. Black resigned, so I really don't know how it would have turned out, but it didn't look good for black.} e6 {I like playing against this defense.} 2. d4 {Looking for a strong center game.} d5 {Anticipated this move and appreciate the tension.} 3. Nc3 {Discouraging the pawn capture.} Nf6 {Touch√© } 4. Bg5 {Pinned the knight, pretty standard so far} h6 {I prefer playing Be2 here as black. Otherwise, my king pawns get skewed and reduces the effectivity of a king side castle} 5. Bxf6 {First blood! I don't mind the exchange and his only option is to double the pawns kingside. Notice black still has no minor pieces developed.} gxf6 6. exd5 {Was hoping to draw his queen out, but either wanted to open up the center.} exd5 {Capture back} 7. Qf3 {I did think it was premature to bring the queen out, but I was eyeing the b7 pawn.} c5 {Mistake on blacks part. I think maybe he thought I would take and give him the center, but that would never happen.} 8. Nxd5 {Things are setting nicely. I just need to coax his bishop out of position.} f5 {He moves to take his pawn out of harms way, but the cell he exited is still my knights target.} 9. Bb5+ {Hoping he brings his bishop out.} Bd7 {Abracadabra!} 10. Nf6+ {Ok, so I have his rook now and thinking this was pretty good. However, commuter analysis calls this move a blunder. Why?} Qxf6 {Really should have moved the king, but I don't think he sees the rook threat.} 11. Qxb7 {Black resigns here.}
