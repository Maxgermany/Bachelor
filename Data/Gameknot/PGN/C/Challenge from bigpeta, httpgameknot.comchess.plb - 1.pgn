[Opening "English (A22), Bremen, reverse dragon"]

1. c4 {My standard opening with white } e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 {Bremen variation } d5 4. cxd5 {This is almost a reflex move as the English opening allows black to build a centre before destroying it.  So this is the most direct application of that idea } Nxd5 5. Bg2 Nxc3 6. bxc3 {and black has effectively exchanged his centre pawn for my b-pawn.  Not a great idea in my opinion } Nc6 7. Nf3 e4 {much better was Bc5 } 8. Ng1 {opening the diagonal for the B and allowing the N to find a safer home } f5 9. Nh3 Be6 10. Rb1 {much better would have been d3 to further open the diagonal  Or 0-0 and get the K to safety } Rb8 {slightly better was Qd7 giving teh chance of 0-0-0 getting the K to safety and making a much more complex game } 11. d3 Bxa2 12. Rb2 {should have played Rb5 hitting a target that could not just move away } Bf7 13. Qa4 {Qa4 temporarily dissuades black from exd which would break up my centre pawns and expose the K before it castled } Qf6 14. O-O {Alittle late but now i can relax and plan } Qxc3 {i commented to my opponent about pawn pinching and he said 'what have i got to lose?'  well as we shall see with the Q isolated out of place - quite a lot } 15. Ng5 Bg8 {why guard a pawn that is well protected?  Qa5 would have forced the issue and prevented the moves that follow } 16. dxe4 Qc4 {offering the exchange } 17. Qa1 {but i prefer to keep my Q on the a-file as part of my attack } h6 {attacking a piece that is not even involved in the action.  Qa6 would have prevented the threatened carnage } 18. exf5 {and realising the size of the attack black resigns. }
