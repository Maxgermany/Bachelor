1. d4 {This was the last match of the 2016-7 season.} d5 {It is a sweet little game, where I mate him on move 21.} 2. c4 {So I play my usual.} Nf6 {This is the third or fourth time I have met this, this season, so it is obviously popular, at least at this level. See this game http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/colwyn-bay-v-malpas-oswestry?gm=62362} 3. cxd5 {So I take again.} Nxd5 {He takes back.} 4. Nf3 {I deviate from the above mentioned game. The reason is on Wednesday April 12 I played in a quick-play tournament in Krakow. I was playing Julia Wiszniewska, 1054. She is just 9 years old. I had white. This was how the game started: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d5 3. cxd5 Nxd5 4. e4 Nf6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Ne2 I was quite happy with this, I seemed to have control of the centre. But then came this 6..............e5 7.	d5	Nb4 8.	Nbc3	Bc5 9.	Bb1	Ng4 10.	O-O	Qh4 11.	h3	Nxf2 12.	Rxf2	Bxf2+ 13.	Kh2	O-O And I am just a pawn and the exchange down without any compensation. But after  14.	a3	Na6 15.	Ba2	Nc5 16.	Qc2	f5 17.	b4	Nxe4 18.	Nxe4	fxe4 19.	Bb2	Bf5 20.	Bxe5	e3 21.	Qxc7	Rf7 22.	d6 I had at least equalised, and after  ........................Qe4?? 23.	Qxf7+	Kh8 24.	Bxg7# I had won a game I really should have lost.} e6 {I tend to think g6 going into a Grunfeld- type position is better.} 5. e4 {Now I do take the centre.} Bb4+ {He throws in a check.} 6. Nbd2 {I thought it better to keep pieces on as I have the space advantage. I was slightly surprised to find out later that Bd2 is more common.} Nf6 {Knight retreats. My e pawn is now attacked, as my Nd2 is pinned. } 7. Bd3 {So I protect it.} Nc6 {Attacking d4. c4 is probably better, maybe leading to  c5 8. Qb3 Nc6 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. O-O O-O 11. Nc4 Qc7 12. e5 Ng4 13. Bf4 f6 14. Rae1 fxe5 15. Bxe5 Ncxe5 16. Nfxe5 Bxf2+ 17. Rxf2 Nxf2 18. Re3 Qc5 19. Be2 Ne4 20. Kh1 Nf2+ 21. Kg1 Ne4 22. Kh1 Nf2+ 23. Kg1} 8. a3 {If he takes on d2 I was going to take back with my queen, and if he then plays Nxd4 I can exchange knights and then win his queen with Bb5+} Ba5 {He drops back. I think Be7 was better, but he said he wanted to re-route the bishop to attack d4.} 9. b4 {So I attack it again.} Bb6 {He drops back.} 10. Nb3 {I give d4 more protection} O-O {I think this is a mistake. What would you play now?} 11. e5 {Opening up a diagonal to his king.} Nd5 {Knight moves of course. What would you play now?} 12. Bxh7+ {Did you find it? The so-called "Greek Gift" attack.} Kh8 {If he takes, Ng5+ gives me a winning attack.} 13. Ng5 {Preparing Qh5} g6 {So he stops it.} 14. Qg4 {But my queen can still get to the h file.} Kg7 {So he moves his king off the h file} 15. Qh4 {I am planning a second piece sacrifice.} Rh8 {He is trying to prevent a disaster on the h file. But luckily my knight can move out of the way with check.} 16. Nxe6+ {Like this. Now if he takes with the bishop Qh6 is mate.} fxe6 {So this is the only other move he has, but it is soon mate. Can you see how yet? } 17. Qh6+ {His reply is forced.} Kf7 18. Qxg6+ {Driving his king to a dark square so that my bishop on c1 can join in.} Kf8 {He chose this way.} 19. Bh6+ {And the bishop check comes in.} Ke7 {Forced. I can win his queen here with Bg5+ but why take the queen when you can mate him?} 20. Qg7+ {Like this.} Ke8 {Forced!} 21. Bg6# {And this!
