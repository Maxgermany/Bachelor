1. d4 d5 2. c4 {This is the first direct conflict of the game and a tricky one at that. If I take the pawn, he will move Qa4+ to put me in check and take my c4 pawn as a result. He would then have complete control of the middle of the board with his queen and pawn there. Therefore, I took a passive approach to the situation.} e6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6. a3 Bd6 7. h3 O-O 8. Bd3 Re8 9. Ng5 h6 10. Nf3 {We both know that a conflict in the middle of the board with the pawns is inevitable, so we are both trying to strengthen our claims to it by putting as much firepower on it as possible.} e5 {I make an aggressive move with this pawn because I want to gain control the "e" column with my rook already in place. } 11. dxe5 Bxe5 12. Nxe5 Rxe5 13. f4 Re8 14. g4 {The necessary trade offs are made, and now I am in control of the "e" column. My opponent opts to strengthen his pawn structure, but he overlooks the pawn standoff that had begun on the second move of the game.} d4 {This move is a gamebreaker. He cannot take it with his e3 pawn because it would put his king in check. His only option is to withdraw his knight from danger.} 15. Ne2 dxe3 {I now have a foothold in the enemy's territory, so now I must bring other pieces in to threaten his king's position.} 16. h4 Nxg4 {My opponent overlooks the effects of that last move, so I seize the opportunity to strengthen my position in his territory.} 17. Rg1 Nc5 18. f5 Nxd3+ 19. Kf1 Qxh4 {Now my queen is on top of the enemy king and she has a lot of support behind her. It's now a simple matter of backing his king into a corner.} 20. Rg2 Qh1+ 21. Ng1 Bxf5 {Brought my bishop in to guard both of my formerly unprotected knights.} 22. Qf3 e2+ 23. Rxe2 {With this, his fate is sealed. The only way he could have avoided a forced checkmate is if he had taken the pawn with his queen, but that would have crippled his forces beyond recognition anyway.} Nh2+ 24. Rxh2 Re1# {Finish the game with a nice little knight sacrifice to open up a path for the "e" column rook. Look how important it became!}
