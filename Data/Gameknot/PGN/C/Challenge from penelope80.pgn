1. e4 {This is my favorite.} c5 {And, he plays the Sicilian which is how I answer.  Coach Stockel said that in a tournament, about two years ago, they played the Sicilian.  17 moves were all analyzed, but then, someone played a move that was not analyzed before and turned out to be very good.  That's why a lot of GM's stopped playing it, recently. } 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Of course, I'm used to everything up until right here.  As the first defense that I had to learn was the Sicilian Nadjorf.} 6. Be3 {Although, I think Jack said sometime ago, that this is the main response to 5...a6.} Ng4 {But, things become interesting as Giuseppe is threatening to exchange B for N which favors him.  The logic behind GM Susan Polgar advising me to not exchange B for N without a good reason is because of something I recently found out.  They say that B and N are both worth 3 points.  But, that's no true for the B.  The N is, but a B is worth 3.5 points, according to what a GM told Jack.} 7. Bg5 {Having said that, I would've played 7.Bd2 since Giuseppe will reattack.} h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 {I knew that all of that was coming.  But, I guess that this is a better place for the DSB then on d2.} Bg7 {Guiuseppe continues with his development and prepares to castle, as would I.  One thing is for sure that after fianchettoing, bringing the B out like this is generally what you want to do, as I recently learned from Jack.  The reason being is that you don't waste a tempo with ...e6 or ...e5 to get it out.} 10. h3 {I would've continued developing and prepared to castle with 10.Bd3  But, Laura finds a very clever move and goes right after Giuseppe's N.} Ne5 11. Qd2 {And, she brings her Q in action.  Her goal is to castle long.  I, however, would developed the Bf1 and prepared to castle short.  But, this has got to better.  And, I see why given that a pawn near has advanced.  So, castling Q side is safer.} Nbc6 {Meanwhile, Giuseppe continues developing.  So, he goes on the other side.  He, on the other hand, will castle short.  Castling on opposite wings makes things very interesting.} 12. O-O-O Nxd4 {But, Giuseppe, forces and exchange, first.  Personally, I wouldn't have done that just because I would not be ready to exchange yet.  As I'd be doing it just because it's possible which is not a good reason, as kenneth_fiore_3 has stressed to me.  But, there's something about that which makes it good here.} 13. Qxd4 O-O {I would've gone on the offense with a masked battery, by moving the Ne5.  But, I like this move just as much.} 14. Nd5 {Centralizing her N.  And, this is where I start to see a draw coming since both sides are well developed and centralized.  In addition, this move poses a nasty threat.  Although it won't win anything, forking on b6 would force Giuseppe to exchange his undeveloped B.} b5 {Contrary to before, I don't see the point of this move.  I do believe that Giuseppe played this for a pawn chain, but I know there's more to it then just that.  In this position, I would've gone on the offense with 14...e6} 15. Bxe5 {I am shocked that Laura plays this given that a B is usually worth more.  On the other hand, there are times where it is necessary to exchange B for N.  I guess this is one of them.  However, I didn't see an immediate threat Giuseppe's N.} Bxe5 16. Qb6 {Going for a Q exchange which is what I also would've done since Giuseppe's Q is starting to become a menace.  In addition, this will also fork and force black to exchange his undeveloped B.  It's right here that I figure out the likeliness that this is, in fact, a draw.  It's not clear cut, yet, but I begin to realize just how difficult it would be for Giuseppe to win.} Qxb6 17. Nxb6 Rb8 {Going after the N in response to the fork.} 18. Nxc8 Rfxc8 19. g3 {Afterwhich, Laura plans to complete her development with this fianchetto.} a5 {I don't see the point behind this move since it is not a passed pawn.  That might be his goal.  On the other hand, I'm not so sure what I would've done.  But, I'd probably answer with 19...Rc5, followed by 20...Rc8 to attack c2 twice.} 20. Be2 {This is very interesting.  As I would've completed the fianchetto with 20.Bg2, but Laura still completes her development with this move.  Believe it or not, I like this move even better since this threatens to attack with 21.Bg4  In fact, that's why white played this since Giuseppe will stop that threat with his next move.} Rc5 21. Rd5 {Laura goes for a R exchange which is what I also would've done.  The idea is that the R is menace, so get it out of it.  But, with this exchange, I now know that it's a draw.  It's not if but when.  I thought it would take longer, but it's around the corner.} Rxd5 22. exd5 b4 {Making an advancement of his pawn.  I, however, would've held off and gone on the offense with 22...Bd4  } 23. b3 {Having said that, I like Laura's response.  Not seeing the point behind the last move, this is also what I would've done.} f5 {But, I can see it here, however, since not two, but three of Giuseppe's pawns are now connected.  So, with 3 against 3, it does poes as a real threat of breaking through.  By breaking through, I mean advancing, exchanging pawns, and getting an unstoppable passed pawn that would promote.} 24. g4 {But, Laura puts a stop to that which is what I also would've done.} f4 {Rather then exchange and allow a passed pawn, Giuseppe blocks it here.  And, this is how I also would've answered.  After that, given that it's Laura's move, Giuseppe agrees that noone can win and offers a draw.  Laura agrees with that conclusion and accepts the offer.}
