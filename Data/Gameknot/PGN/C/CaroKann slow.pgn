1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {This is the 'Advance Variation' and I feel the best weapon available to white. Nimzowitsch appreciated its potential, as did Mikhail Tal. I'm a fan also.} Bf5 {The continuation with 3....Bf5 is still the most popular choice. I have however used Botvinnik-Carls gambit quite successfully with 3....c5, and it is now part my repetoire. The Kavalek Variation with 3....Na6 is an interesting alternative which I have touched on the odd occasions.} 4. Nc3 {4.Nc3 is part of the Nigel Short repetoire which he used in the PCA 1993 world championship challenge. I like it. } e6 5. Nf3 {As you will see over the next few moves, simple development with Be2, and kingside castling will lead to a quieter game with a lot of maneuvering. This is my preference. I have however used the sharp Van der Wiel Variation 4.Nc3 e6 5. g4! which leads to exciting play on a few occasions, mostly as a surprise weapon in OTB chess.} Nd7 {Still in the main lines. This move covers the c5 square and places pressure on the e5 square as well. The battle for the centre is underway.} 6. Be2 Ne7 7. O-O h6 {I feel this pre-emptive move is too quiet, and loses a tempo. Blacks pieces are already congested and a more sharper alternative would be my choice. 7....Bg4, is a possibility or alternatively 7....Ng6, which would be my preference, freeing the black diagonal bishop. If white opts for h3, then Nh4.} 8. Be3 {8. Re1 is a natural alternative, but this move with 8.Be3 reinforces the centre pawns preparing against the inevitable ....c4 assault. In addition it is a good developing move. The rooks are only one move away from being connected!} a6 {I feel this move weakens the pawn structure unnecessarily, and does nothing to place pressure on Whites control of the centre. In addition, it has created a target for white on the b6 square with that backward pawn. 8....Q-c7 would be more active. The advance to a6 should only be used if forced. Otherwise a7 is the best position for it.} 9. a3 {This is what may be called a 'Prophylaxis' move. ie. Taking preventative measures in anticipation of an opponents move. This move is already laying the groundwork for a Queenside attack.} c5 {I feel this move was premature, there is not enough artillery present to make this effective. 9....Qc7 could still have been utilized. Obviously, Black wanted to use this as an attacking move, as well as a freeing move for his Knight and black diagonal bishop, but I feel it could have waited.} 10. dxc5 {No hesitation required in accepting the pawn.} Nc6 {A perfunctory glance shows Black has now opened some lines and alleviated the congestion. However Black has failed to see that the b6 square has been Whites target since 8....a6. } 11. Na4 {Now Knight to a4! This move protects the valuable c5 pawn as well as threatening Nb6.} Qb8 {I feel Qc7 would be a better move. Keeping the Queen guarding the a5-d8 diagonal is arguably a better alternative. In addition the 'a' file rook would still remain active. This move loses another tempo for black because this is not the ideal placement for the queen. The Queen will have to move again.} 12. Qd2 {White could have moved 12.b4 now. But  d2 gets the Queen active, as well as opening a path for both whites rooks to get involved at a later date. They are now connected. There is no rush, White has developed comfortably and there are no immediate threats.} Ncxe5 {I feel the following moves for black were in the wrong sequence. These subtle differences accumulate to small advantages for white. This is an obvious choice in one respect. But was the e5 pawn really going anywhere? White already knows this pawn this pawn is lost. The knight move to a4 confirms Whites intentions on keeping the c5 pawn instead. I feel Black could have delayed this move and alternatively moved 12....Be7 leaving the King the option of castling and activating the h file rook if required.} 13. Nd4 {No hesitation here. Placing a direct threat on the bishop whilst developing the Knight.} Be4 {This is a wasted move I feel. White was planning to activate this pawn regardless. The bishop should have retreated h7 immediately. Another tempo lost for Black.} 14. f3 Bh7 15. b4 {Now b4! White has claimed a lot of space and developed well. } Qd8 {This is the 2nd time the Queen has shifted in 4 moves? I still feel the c7 square is a better placement for the Queen. } 16. f4 Nc6 {The only square really. Blacks Queenside is certainly a little light regarding defenders, and travelling to the Kingside would certainly be worse. Note how all Whites pieces are active even in latent form. In addition both rooks can travel on any of the a to f files if required. } 17. Nxc6 {Qc7 on move 15 may could have prevented the further weakening of the b file, by giving the option the Queen retaking. Now the  bxc6 is forced. } bxc6 {I considered 18.Nb6 but strengthening the centre, placing support to the control of the e5 square, and limiting the possible activation of the bishop via g6 was a better alternative at this stage. So the next move is Bd4!  } 18. Bd4 Nf6 {Be7 is an interesting alternative. For example 18....Be7, 19. Bxg7, Rg8, 20.Bd4, Be4! with some counterplay for the sacrifice. In addition 20....Bf6 is alternative. Black gains an open g file for the pawn and an opportunity to swap Whites dangerous black diagonal bishop. Obviously declining the offered pawn leads to different lines but Black is no worse off regardless. And still gets gets his bishop active and a chance to castle if White declines the offer.} 19. Bd3 {c4 is still a waiting move for white. Blacks white diagonal bishop could cause problems later and best to swap it off now. Controlling the the b1-h7 diagonal would limit whites rook to the b file placement if needed. And anyway why give black any possible bullets? Blacks black diagonal bishop is going nowhere. Best keep him congested for as long as possible, and eradicate the one that is free.} Bxd3 20. Qxd3 {The obvious choice. The c2 pawn will be needed for c5 at a later date to crack open black centre pawn formation.} Be7 {The best for Black at this stage. } 21. Nb6 {F5 is a tempting move but after 21....0-0, Blacks King escapes. Keeping the pressure on by forcing Black to move his rook is a better alternative I feel. In addition the placement of the knight here cramps Black position further. It controls a lot of squares including the all important c5 when the time is right.} Ra7 {The best choice.} 22. f5 {Now f5! The next sequence of moves are forced.} exf5 23. Qxf5 O-O {Finally Blacks King finds safety.} 24. Rad1 {The d file placement is important. The threat of a pin against Blacks Queen is real after c5. In addition, there is latent  pressure against the d5 pawn. This will come to fruition after white begins to advance a,b,c file pawns.} Nd7 {There is no doubt Black is in trouble. May-be Black was hoping White would swap knights. No chance of that, the knight is very strong on b6. May-be Qb8 would have been a stronger defence. 24....Qb8, 25. Bxf6,Bxf6, 26.Nd7,Rxd7, 27.Qxd7 leaving Black with a better chance of defence. The Black diagonal bishop would be a strong defender. Alternatively if White opted for an immediate 25.c4 then dxc4, Nxc4 leaves Black better as well. I think Black needed to think more laterally here.} 25. c4 {Finally, the best time to advance this pawn. The groundwork had been prepared.} Nxb6 {Getting rid of that pesky knight was pressing} 26. cxb6 Rd7 {The logical placement.} 27. c5 {c5! The best. Closes any counterplay by Black on the Queenside. The b6 pawn is strong. Usually when a pawn reaches the 6th rank it is very strong. If it gets to the 7th then its usually a winning game. Black will have its resources tied down to the defence of the b7 square. White can continue its attack.} Bg5 {Black needs to open a file and the 'e file' is the only one available.} 28. a4 {White will continue its assault on the Queenside hoping to link two pass pawns.} Re8 {Or 28....e7. Dosn't matter. It is now a waiting game for Black, no choice. White is continuing Queenside push.} 29. b5 axb5 {This is best of a bad bunch.} 30. axb5 {What about Re6 followed by Rg6? Getting the rook off the back rank, being maybe a stronger defence. Next move g6? prevents the rook from using that square.} g6 31. Qd3 {A nice central position for the Queen.} Re6 {I feel Qc8 may have been better now that the g6 square is unavailable, freeing up d8 for the bishop if required. } 32. Rde1 {The obvious choice.} Rxe1 {Pretty much forced.} 33. Rxe1 cxb5 {Now white has finally achieved his strategy of getting linked passed pawns!  } 34. c6 Re7 {Only a matter of time now. } 35. Rxe7 Qxe7 36. g3 {This move was important in opening up an escape route for the King as well as preventing Bf4.} Bf6 {What else has Black got?} 37. Bxf6 Qxf6 38. b7 {Not that it matters too much but Qe5 is a stronger defence in a losing position.} Qa1+ 39. Kf2 Qb2+ {Again Black should have taken the opportunity of Qe5 instead.} 40. Qe2 Qd4+ {Qf6 would have delayed the inevitable  a little longer.} 41. Kg2 {Resignation was very appropiate here. An interesting game.  I felt Black played too passively. Black allowed White to develop comfortably without ever really putting the question to him. White managed to utilize the advantages of force quite effectively. White had control of territory,space,area etc. Black did not effectively contest these important advantages. In addition the erection of a superior pawn formation by White snuffed out any counterplay. Playing the Caro-Kann defence requires patience. But development is the key. Black must not fall into the trap having a purely defensive mindset.The pawn formation in the 'Advance Variation' gives White an advantage in space. But the draw back for this is that the centre can be undermined by say ...f6 and ...c5. White obviously has better freedom and co-ordination of minor pieces in this variation but cannot directly attack. So this where careful placement of pieces is required by Black and development paramount! Blacks best chances lay in a Queenside attack, and it must actively seek to create some weakness in the Queenside pawn structure then bring in as many pieces as possible into attack. I feel an annotated game should be simply explained whilst conveying the basic strategic, and tactical concepts. I have always been adverse to complicated analysis, involving multiple lines running many moves. For what end? A game that is simply explained showing the process involved in the win/defeat is much better for those trying to grasp the concept of strategy. I hope this game assists those up and coming players, and also gives some amusement to those more experienced ones. }
