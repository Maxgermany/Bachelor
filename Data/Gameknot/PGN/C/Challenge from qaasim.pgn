1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Qc7 {Rather non-standard. Computer identifies this as an inaccuracy, and prefers 3. ... g6 } 4. O-O a6 5. Bc4 {Not 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3 c4. Not 5. Bd3 (cramps position). Be2 is probably playable.} Nf6 6. Nc3 e6 7. d4 {This is one of 2 possible ways of activating the c1 bishop. The other alternative, which is more cramping, is b3. Note that d3 is not a good option due to the threat of b5.} b5 8. d5 {! Retreating the bishop may be safer, but this forces black to deal with white's advantage in the center.} Nd4 {Computer identifies this as an inaccuracy, preferring 8. ... Ne5 as a way of drawing in more pieces.} 9. Be2 {Not 9. Nxd4? cxd4 losing a piece.  Computer analysis prefers 9. e5 Ng4 10. d6 Qc6 11. Bd3 f5 12. Bf4 Bb7 13. h3 Nxf3+ 14. Qxf3 Qxf3 15. gxf3 Nh6 16. a4 c4, which gives white a slight space advantage at the cost of doubled pawns on the f file and no good place for the light-squared bishop.} Bb7 {? Black doesn't have time for this - 9. ... Nxe2 or Nxf3+ is needed.} 10. Nxd4 cxd4 11. Qxd4 {A key pawn is now gone, and white has the upper hand. It's up to black to prove that he can recover, otherwise white will trade down to a won endgame.} Bc5 12. Qd3 {Still leaves the Bc1 somewhere to go.} Qe5 13. Bf3 exd5 14. exd5 O-O {Black must get the king off of the line of fire, otherwise white will force a queen trade with Qe2.} 15. Bd2 Rac8 {?! Unclear why black is attacking white's strongest point here.} 16. Rae1 Qb8 {f5, g5, h5, f4, g3, and h2 are all covered.  Computer significantly prefers 16. … Qd4 17. Qxd4 Bxd4 18. a3 Rfe8 19. Rxe8+ Rxe8 20. Re1 Rxe1+ 21. Bxe1 d6 22. Bd2 Bxc3 23. Bxc3 Bxd5 24. Be2 Be4 25. Bxf6 gxf6 which leads directly to a fairly even endgame, with a slight advantage to white caused by black's doubled and more scattered pawns.} 17. a3 Bd6 18. g3 {Forced - there's no other way to defend h2.} Qa8 {The computer identifies this as an inaccuracy, preferring 18. … Rfe8 19. a4 b4 20. Ne4 Be5 21. Bxb4 Bxd5 22. c3 Bxe4 23. Bxe4 Nxe4 24. Rxe4 a5 25. Bxa5 Qxb2 26. Qxd7. This would have liquidated the queenside, leaving white with only an advantage of the a-pawn.} 19. Bg5 Ne8 {Black may be better off here allowing white to trade.} 20. Be7 {! Forces black to trade off another piece, and threatens d7.} Bxe7 21. Rxe7 f5 {? Nf6 is better here. (Computer agrees with me)} 22. Rxd7 {And now white has a passed pawn.} Nf6 23. Re7 Rcd8 24. Re5 Bc6 {I think black is trying to bait white into dxc6. No dice. Computer prefers 24. … g6 25. Qd4 Rd6 26. Rfe1 Rfd8 27. Re6 Rxe6 28. Rxe6 Nxd5 29. Nxd5 Bxd5 30. Re8+ Rxe8 31. Bxd5+ Re6 32. Bxa8, but in any event black is in a pretty lousy position by now.} 25. Kg2 {This allows the d5 pawn to move. Computer analysis prefers 25. Qxf5 Bb7 26. Qg5 Rd6 27. Rfe1 Rf7 28. Re7 Qf8 29. Rxf7 Qxf7 30. Re6 Qf8 31. Bg2 Kh8 which protects the bishop by eventually playing Bg2.} Be8 26. Qxf5 {Not 26. Rxf5 Bg6 winning the rook. However, the computer notes that this really shouldn't have worked, and better would have been 26. Rd1 Bd7 27. d6 Qb8 28. Nd5 Kh8 29. Ne7 Rfe8 30. Qd4 Ng4 31. Bxg4 fxg4 32. Rde1 Qb7+ 33. Kg1.} Nxd5 {Black should not have tried to force the immediate recapture. 26. … Nd7 27. Rxe8 Rfxe8 28. d6 Qb8 29. Qd5+ Kh8 30. Rd1 Nb6 31. Qb7 Qxb7 32. Bxb7 Nc4 33. d7 Re7 34. Bxa6 Rexd7 reduces white's advantage significantly.} 27. Bxd5+ {White has to recapture with the bishop, otherwise he loses the queen for a rook. According to the computer, white could have pounced very nicely by playing 27. Rxe8 Rfxe8 28. Bxd5+ Rxd5 29. Nxd5 Qc6 30. Rd1 a5 31. Qd3 Re6 32. Rd2 Kh8 33. Qf3 Re8 34. Ne3 Qc7 35. Nd5, which would have given a piece advantage.} Rxd5 28. Qe4 {The key move of this sequence, sorta-pinning the d5 rook against a8.} Rd6 {?? Loses a piece. Correct play is Rd8 offering a queen trade. (Computer agrees with me on this)} 29. Qxa8 Bc6+ 30. Qxc6 Rxc6 31. Rfe1 Rcf6 32. f4 h6 {Otherwise white will hammer black's back-rank weakness.} 33. Re5e8 {White will now force off both of black's rooks, preventing any sort of counterplay.} Kh7 34. Rxf8 Rxf8 35. Nd5 Rc8 36. c3 Rc6 37. f5 Rd6 38. Re5 h5 39. Kh3 Rh6 40. Re6 a5 {? This accomplishes nothing.} 41. Rxh6+ {Black has no winning chances whatsoever from here. He might have played on looking for a stalemate. Computer suggests white was playing it safer than he needed to: 41. Kh4 Kg8 42. Rxh6 gxh6 43. Kxh5 accomplishes the same goal, but with an extra couple of pawns to show for it.} Kxh6 42. Kh4 g5+ 43. Kh3 Kg7 44. g4 h4 45. Nc7 {Forces the creation of a queenside passed pawn. Now black has no way to prevent a promotion.} b4 {Black's best chance, and it's a bad one, is to make a run for the queenside with his king while staying close enough to f8 to stop white if he goes that way.} 46. cxb4 axb4 47. a4 b3 48. a5 Kf6 49. Nb5 Ke5 {This could have been the start of some clever maneuvering by black, but he chooses not to follow through. A viable option would be to make a run for c2 threatening to promote on b1. It's a long shot, but the best he has.} 50. a6 Kf6 {?? This is either giving up, or hoping for a stalemate.} 51. a7 Kg7 52. a8=Q Kh6 53. Qe8 {? Missed an easy one: Qh8#} Kg7 54. Qe6 {Missed another one: 54. Qe7+ Kh6 55. f6 Kg6 56. Qg7#} Kh7 55. Qg6+ {Missed it again: 55. Qe7+ Kh6 56. f6 Kg6 57. Qg7#} Kh8 56. Qxg5 Kh7 57. f6 Kh8 58. Qg7# {}
