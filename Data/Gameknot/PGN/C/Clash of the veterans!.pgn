[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C92), closed, Flohr-Zaitsev system (Lenzerheide variation)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. c3 d6 {So far the standard closed Ruy Lopez variation. Black often played the Marshall Attack here, 8...d5 offering a pawn for an attack.} 9. h3 {Recommended to stop Bg4} Bb7 10. d4 exd4 {Although this exchange has been played before, I think Black does better to delay it. It give White the square c3 for the Nb1 and leaves White in control of the centre.} 11. cxd4 Qd7 {Qd7 looks a natural move, but is not on the Gameknot opening databases.} 12. Nc3 Nd8 {This move looks horrible. Presumably it is to prepare c5, but surely Na5 was a better way to prepare it.} 13. d5 {with the idea of meeting c5 with pxp ep.} c6 14. dxc6 {So I take it off, to make sure Black is straddled with a backward pawn on the semi-open d file. If I didn;t play this, he might play c5 next move.} Bxc6 {The knight recapture looks more natural to me, but Black has a plan} 15. Bf4 Ne6 16. Bh2 Nc5 17. Bc2 {It seemed to me that the position is fairly open so the Bishops are better than the Knights.} Rad8 {Threatening to get rid of his weakness with d5} 18. b4 Nb7 {Returning the Knight to e6 seems more natural to me.} 19. Nd4 Rfe8 20. Nxc6 Qxc6 21. Qd3 {Now d5 is prevented as it opens up the b1-h7 diagonal for a killing queen check on h7} g6 22. Rad1 {Again, making it impossible to play d5 without losing a pawn.} Qc4 {A somewhat drastic way of reducing the pressure!} 23. Qxc4 bxc4 24. Rd4 Rdc8 25. a3 {To avoid black playing d5 followed by Bxb4} Bf8 26. Nd5 {I was rather worried about the Black Bishop coming to g7 with threats along the long dark squared diagonal} Nxd5 27. Rxd5 Bg7 28. Rc1 Bh6 29. f4 g5 30. g3 f6 31. Kf2 c3 32. Kf3 Re6 {I think both c3 - opening up the b3-g8 diagonal - and Rd3 are mistakes} 33. Bb3 Kg7 34. Rxg5+ Kf7 35. Rh5 Kg6 36. f5+ {I was very pleased with finding f5, but my opponent pointed out the simply BxR won - if KxR Bf7 mate!} Kxh5 37. g4+ Kg5 38. Bf4+ Kh4 39. Bg3+ Kg5 40. h4# {}
