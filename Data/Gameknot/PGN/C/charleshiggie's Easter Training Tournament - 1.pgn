[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), Chigorin variation"]

1. d4 {So, white kicks things off with the Queen's Pawn Opening.} d5 {Standard.} 2. Nc3 {Now, I had expected white to attempt the QG with 1.c4, but this is ok.  I mean, it develops, but the other move was a little better only because it's studied more by masters and GM's.  Afterall, Mr. Stockel told me that it is a good idea to play moves that masters and GM's analyze, and the realjimfrior, the current mentor for chicoboy and me, agrees with this assessment.  He said, "that's how you learn best", in my game against him.} h6 {?! I do not know why black played this, but better was to bring out one of his N's  or develop a central pawn.  This, however is not a developing move, and it does not help him to control the center. } 3. e4 {Now, this is a very interesting position.  Should black allow this, everything will transpose into a QG.  Of course, however, that is not going to happen.} Nf6 {But, it does, however, appear that the position has transposed into the Benoni Defense.  That's because white's position is the same but in a completely different sequence, and the same could be said about black's position. } 4. e5 {!! At this point, white decides to chase black's N, in order to kick it and gain tempo.  BTW, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this move.  At first, It thought that 4.Nf3, or 4.Bd3 was better for development, and that is what I would have played, if I were white.  But, as we will see later on, this is the best move, in this position.  And, it will eventually cause problems for black.  I'm sure that white kept this in mind before he played this.  } Ne4 {In this position, white wants to exchange, and he is going to succeed in doing so.  Note: This is a version of the Exchange Variation, at least in my opinion.  I'm not sure, but I think that an exchange variation occurs whenever there is an even exchange of material.} 5. Nxe4 dxe4 6. f3 {If I were white, 6.Nf3?? would have come into consideration.  However, I would not have played that on the grounds of 6...exf3 7.gxf3, losing a piece for a pawn.  So, I would I even look at a bad move.  Well, in chess one should always be thinking about a way to develop.  That's because it's a good idea to develop all of your pieces early in the game, until your left with a Q and both R's.} exf3 7. Nxf3 e6 {Although black moved here to develop, he should have waited and brought his LSB out first.  Why?  This move will only give him one place to develop his bishop.  And, he cannot do it without cramming it.  Now, this is what Jack Stockel meant when he told me not to cram your pieces.  That's because, it might take him two moves, instead of one, to get a piece out.  Either way, however, in order for lesplay to complete development, black would have to spend more moves then normal to get his pieces out, and that is why 4.e5!!.  Had that not been played, I am sure that black would be almost completely developed.  This also shows why it is a good to get things out ASAP, and not procrastinate on developing.  With that in mind, white now has a noticeable advantage because he is more developed and much closer to controlling the center.  In fact, chicoboy's center is almost completely controlled, in my opinion, because of where his central pawns are positioned.} 8. Bb5+ {! This is another strong move by white.} c6 {?! I understand that black wanted to kick whites LSB.  But, being obsessed with attacking pieces can cause problems.  Although it does force white to retreat his bishop, I believe that this move is a waste of time for black because lesplay could have used it to develop.  As cdeburca once told me, don't just kick pieces for the thrill of it.  So, better was 8...Bd7, or 8...Nd7.  } 9. Ba4 Qa5+ {? This move is actually his first mistake, and not just an inaccuracy.  The real reason is that one should develop his or her minor pieces before bringing out the major pieces.  In fact, the Q should be the last thing that emerges.  So, in my opinion, best was 9...Nd7.  If not, he also had the option of developing his DSB or LSB.  Now, if white finds the right move, black will be in a lot of trouble.} 10. c3 {Ok, this is a way for white to get out of check.  But, best was 10.Bd7!, hitting the Q.  That was actually the move that would have gotten black into trouble.  Although I mentioned that you don't just want to kick material for the thrill of it, there is way more to this then meets the eye.  What am I talking about?  First, 10.Bd7 develops another piece.  Second, lesplay is then to retreat his Queen.  Third, after he gets the Q out of harm's way, white gets to castle, and castling is another way to develop.  So, basically, white gets to make two developing moves, while black just wastes time bringing his major piece out instead of developing.  Having said that, I would have played 10.Bd7 followed by 11.0-0, if I were white.  } Be7 {At least, black has a chance to catch up on development.} 11. O-O {In response, white decides to castle.} O-O {But, so does black.} 12. b4 {I understand that chicoboy wanted to get black's Q out of there, but better was to develop the DSB.  However, I think that white is playing extremely well.  } Qb6 13. a3 {I do not know why white played this.  It might have been to connect the pawns, but that is more useful during endgames.  } a6 {And, I also do not know why black this.  Instead, lesplay should have developed his b8 N, or LSB.} 14. Be3 {! Ok, this is a solid move.  Afterall, this is chicoboy's last minor piece.  After the Q comes out, white is completely developed.} Qd8 {Why did black move his Q back?  Afterall, it is not attacked, and lesplay could have used this move to develop.} 15. Ra2 {Not a bad move, but if I were white, I would have brought the Q out.  That's because it completes development and connects the rooks.} b5 {So, black now decides to attack white's LSB.  This is now a very interesting position for both sides.} 16. Bc2 Bb7 {! Guess what?  Despite what myevilluck told me, I like to fianchetto my pieces.  In fact, Mr. Stockel told me that it's generally a good idea to put your bishop on the longest square.  To me, this is one of black's best moves because it's a good way to develop a piece.  Now, the question is, will he develop the N?  That is to be seen.  } 17. Qd3 {At last, chicoboy developed his final piece.  Now, that all is said and done, white is now completely developed.  Not only that, but, coincidentally, he is threatening mate in one.} f5 {In this case, that was a good move from black.  But, ...g6 was best as it also prevents the threat.  In addition, he would still have an opportunity to get his b8 N out.  With this move, however, black loses his opportunity to develop anything else, at once.  This is another reason why lesplay should have completed his development, when he had the chance.} 18. exf6 e.p. {So now, we get into an exchange variation.  Like I said before, black cannot develop his N, or he will lose a B for a P because of 19.PXB, QXP.} Rxf6 {?? Although lesplay prevents white from winning a pawn, this move instantly loses.  Although white was already winning, this capture will immediately lead to black's downfall.  The reason being is that chicoboy now has an inevitable mating sequence against black.} 19. Qh7+ {So, white starts by placing black in check.} Kf7 {Also feasible was 19...Kf8, but then 20.Kh8, Kf7 (forced) 20.Ne5#.  Either way, mate is unavoidable, as I mentioned earlier.  This move, however, delays the inevitable.} 20. Ne5+ {After black get's out, white places lesplay back in check.} Ke8 {Black also could have played, 20...Kf8, but then 21.Qh8#.  So, this move delays mate for a move.} 21. Bg6+ {However, after this check, it will no longer be feasible for black to delay mate.} Rxg6 {Although white will mate with 22.Qxg6#.  Guess what?  If black had played 21...Kf8 instead, then 22.Qh8#.  So, chicoboy gets to mate in one, no matter what his opponent plays.} 22. Qxg6# {In this particular game, black went wrong because he did not develop all of his pieces or control the center.  But, white managed to do all of the above.  Here's the thing, out of all three steps black followed through one of them, while white completed all of the tasks and then some.  According to schakertjie, in the opening your main goals should be to, "1 control the center 2 develop develop develop 3 get the king to safety."  I strongly agree with this assessment, and that is also the moral of this story.}
