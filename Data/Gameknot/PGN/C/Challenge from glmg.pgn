[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 {I am annotating this game as much for my benefit as anyone else's. I got to play an opening I don't normally play that is normally quite agressive with many attacking ideas for white. Instead it ended up being almost a bind type structure where black ends up getting constricted with equal material and white can slowly slowly improve his position. I hurried a little too fast and blundered into a slightly better position that was very tactical and it finished with a nice forced variation. } d6 2. f4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. d4 {The Pirc, Austrian attack. Normally 4.d4 is played move 4 because 4 ..c5 allows black to transpose into some Sicilian-type lines. The opening scores reasonably well for white, but is not something get to play very often. I can also be arrived at from 1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4 Bg7 5. Nf3. Both sides have chances but it gives white more attacking chances and black will be required to defend for most of the game and pick their spots. } O-O {The other move here is c5. } 6. Bd3 {There are three main moves here. e5, Bd3 and Be3. Responses to them are very different. I do not know enough about the opening to comment about the major differences in the lines and I chose to play Bd3 to castle kingside. It is also the most common move in databases in this position. e5 is always an idea here to break open the center and get an attack going. Be3 ideas normally lead to queenside castling and h4 h5. e5 immediately leads to trades and a strong pawn center for white.  } c6 7. O-O b5 {At this point gameknot's computer analysis program considers white to be about a pawn better even though no side has made any inaccuracies or done anything clever. This is due to whites extra space and the fact that white has many attacking chances. } 8. e5 {! The idea of the setup from the start. Attack the knight and get an attack going, either on the queenside or kingside depending on how black continues. } dxe5 9. fxe5 {Taking with the d pawn is generally worse because the rook on f1 will have pressure along the open file for the forseeable future. Ideas with Ng5 become possible if the rook moves or Qe1-h4 with an attack against an under-guarded king also become considerations. } Nd5 10. Nxd5 Qxd5 11. Qe2 Be6 12. Be3 {Finishing development. c4 at some point here seems pretty good. } Qd8 13. a4 {If ..bxa4 14. Rxa4 white has all the options with rooks controlling two half open files, bishops well placed in the middle, and a better center. This has followed the game Alexey Ivanov vs Ivan Morev played in 2004 but just for a few more moves.} b4 14. a5 {Constricting the knight's movement. I now has basically no good squares. Looking at this position the bishop on g7 looks quite poor staring at a pawn wall and now the knight on b8 has d7 and nothing else as it's future. } Nd7 15. c4 {The idea is to play c5 and continue to restrict black's ability to move and defend itself. The computer thinks this is not the best move, preferring Bc4, trading light-squared bishops and apparently winning a pawn by force. I did not even consider this move more than just glancing at it. It is worth knowing that the computer's line with a pawn up is good but not clearly winning. This still seems fine to me. } bxc3 e.p. {The first official novelty in the position that I can see. In the game between Ivanov and Morev Bg4 was played but that position white can play c5 and pick up b4, pressure c6, play h3 to kill the white bishop and break through in the center. This seems equally as bad, opening the b file totally and they could never really contest it because white's threats are too strong. } 16. bxc3 h6 17. c4 Qc7 18. Be4 {This prepares d5 where white would have a great pawn center and can just push down the middle and break open the position with a great idea. It is important that the bishop is on e6 so black can't play c5 trying to close the center down a little. } Bg4 {..c5 is now possible should white try d5. } 19. h3 {Forcing the capture of the knight and white's light squared bishop now goes unopposed and is a massive factor in the game. The computer actually likes going back to f5 and allowing white to get an attack in on the kingside, but it still thinks white is better there. } Bxf3 20. Qxf3 {With a tempo against the c6 pawn, which is important in stopping black putting a rook on the b-file. } Rac8 21. c5 e6 {And now look at the position. The queen and the rook pressure f7. The queen and the bishop pressure c6. The black knight has no squares in it's future. The bishop on g7 is trapped. All of black's pieces are locked together defending passively from very few squares and white has time and space to carry out whatever plan it would like to. } 22. a6 Nb8 23. Rfb1 {Threatening Rb7 picking up the a7 pawn, which would win the game. } Qd7 24. Rb7 Rc7 25. Rbb1 Qc8 26. Bd3 {Protecting the pawn on a6. I am not sure if this is the best move here, staying solid, making black move, slowly improving the position. The computer says it is fine though. Mostly I now I was having a bit of a hard time coming up with a plan on where to break through. } Nd7 27. h4 {The idea in my mind was to play g4 as well and try to break through on the kingside if nothing opened up on the queenside. } Re8 {Leaving f7 somewhat undefended. This move shows how bad black is because they just cannot escape from their prison in any reasonable way. } 28. Bd2 {With the threat of Ba5, trapping the rook. } Nf8 29. Ba5 Rd7 {White's pieces continue to put a stranglehold on black's position. As long as white plays a reasonable move here to defend d4, which is threatened and would give life to his bishop and open the position, everything should be fine. } 30. Be4 {????? Oh No! Black's only good move, Rxd4, is basically forced. Here white has thrown away basically all of the advantage they had. doing some move to hold everthing together and not give black counterchances is way. better. White is still better here, but not by as much. Not by a long shot. This will now lead into a much more tactical variation where both sides have plans to look out for. Rb4 is probably the best move with Be4 possibly down the line or even doubling on the b-file and infiltrating with the rooks. } Rxd4 31. Bxc6 Re7 32. Bc3 {Up to here was basically forced, and when I looked at it back on move 30 I thought I was fine. The other move I considered was Rb7. This is an idea in many of the possible lines, with the idea that black was have to play 32..Rxb7 33. cxb7 with Qb8 basically forced and with the queen so passive white might still have something. My concern there was Nd7 really holds things together quite nicely and with the bishop threatening to take on e5 and white's pawns looking like weaknesses instead of strenghts it would be possible black would be able to be better in those lines. I thought the best black had here might be to try to sac an exchange or something. Something like Bxe5 here with Ra3 to follow would keep some sort of material equality with white still coming out ahead. } Rc4 33. Rb7 {I though this was better than previously because now e5 is defended. } Rxb7 {?? A blunder. Nd7 is still the move here. This is where I thought an exchance sac would allow black some holding chances. 33..Nd7 34 Rd1 Rxc3 35 Qxc3 Nxe5 (..Qxc6 seems to lead to a long forced line where white is a clear exchange and passed pawn ahead but black has enough to force the perpetual check) 36. Be4 Rd7 and so on with trades and again white is the exhange up with a passed pawn. Probably winning but close. } 34. axb7 Qb8 {And black's queen is now doomed to guard b8 forever. } 35. Rf1 {This gives up the pawn for the pawn on f7. Black should probably not accept this trade. } Rxc5 {And black is now dead. They are technically up a pawn at this moment in time, but there is no way to hold this position. 35..Rxc3 36. Qxc3 Bxe5 is still worse for black but not completely winning on the spot. } 36. Qxf7+ Kh8 37. Bb4 {Technically not as accurate as the best move (37. Qe8!, which I missed completely for some reason) this is totally winning now. Black has no chances. } Rxc6 38. Bxf8 Rc7 39. Bxg7+ Kh7 40. Bf8+ {!! Giving up the queen (temporarily). I enjoyed this because if you don't see this move you might think white needs to back the queen out and give up quite a lot of advantage they have built. Something like 40. Qxe6 Qxb7. White is a piece up with a winning position, but at least at my level, I lose or draw positions like that sometimes and white's king is not the safest. One poor move and a perpetual becomes possible. Instead white has just clearly finished black off. } Rxf7 41. Rxf7+ Kg8 42. Bd6 {The reason this variation works in the first place. Everything just about holds together for white. } Qe8 43. Rf8+ {The evaluation goes to Mate in 12 moves. Exciting stuff. I hope this was enjoyable to read and look at. I definitely enjoyed playing the game and learned some things as well. When you have your opponent dead with no way out of their position (see move 27), take your time and make sure they have no counter-play. I rushed it and let my opponent back into the game. The final series of moves were more tactical than strategical but I didn't make any major blunders and capitalized on my opponent's mistakes. If you haven't tried it I recommend the Austrian attack as an opening that gives white chances to attack with Qe1 to h4 in a similar vein to a white side Dutch or where you can use extra space given by a strong center to slowly choke the life out of your opponent and finish them off at your pleasure. Just remember to hold everything together. }
