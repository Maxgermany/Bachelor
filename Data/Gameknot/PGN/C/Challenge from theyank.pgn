1. d4 Nf6 2. e3 g6 {Getting my Knight out and setting up a fianchetto quickly. } 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Bc4 d5 5. Bb5+ {theyank puts me in check quickly.} c6 {This solid block holds theyank back, connects a pawn island, and causes white to move the white bishop twice within 6 moves.} 6. Bd3 Qd6 {At this point, moving the Queen was more for show than anything else.} 7. a3 b5 8. h3 Bf5 {I wanted to take out his white-squared bishop.} 9. g4 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 b4 11. Bd2 c5 12. axb4 {With the choice of taking d4 or b4 I decided to take d4.} cxd4 13. Nxd4 O-O 14. Na3 Na6 {The whole board is just oddly configured at this point.} 15. c3 Qb6 {I moved my Queen a lot in this game.  Some of the moves were more "showy" than tactical.} 16. f4 Nc7 17. Nab5 Ne4 {I took a calculated risk with this move.} 18. Bc1 a5 {This was to offer a pawn and rook for theyank's rook an good positioning for my Queen.  He didn't go for it.} 19. Nxc7 Qxc7 20. b5 e5 {This is to open the e file.} 21. Nc6 exf4 22. exf4 {With the e file open and the knight in a good outpost, the game takes an interesting turn.} Rae8 23. Qf3 {Not sure why theyank did not take my d pawn?  That would have put him up by 2 points and brought him into a solid position.} Qb6 24. Nd4 Nc5+ {This is the 1st time I put theyank into check. } 25. Kd1 {Not sure why theyank did not block my rook on e8 with his bishop on e3 or his knight on e2?  Either one of these moves could have helped him castle in the future.} a4 26. Re1 Re4 {The idea was to protect my bishop when it takes white's knight on d4 so if white chooses to kill my bishop with the c pawn, I would take that pawn with my rook and place him into check for a second time.  (He doesn't exactly play accordingly)} 27. f5 Bxd4 28. Rxe4 {With 2 ways to capture theyank's rook I chose utilizing pawn so it immediately places pressure on white's Queen.} dxe4 29. Qf4 Bg7 30. Be3 Rd8+ {This starts a series of checks to protect my Queen and knight.  This ultimately leads to capturing theyank's Queen.} 31. Ke2 Qxb5+ 32. Kf2 Nd3+ 33. Kg3 Nxf4 34. Kxf4 {Taking my knight with his King places him in a vulnerable position.} Qd5 35. Rxa4 h6 {Hoping this move quietly goes unnoticed as it is needed to checkmate white if he doesn't move correctly.} 36. c4 {I was hoping for this move!} Qe5# {}
