1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. f4 {This move looks solid, but it allows Morphy to begin seizing a commanding lead in development. } Qb6 {Preparing to smash McConnell's Pawn chain.} 6. Nf3 {Finally, he moves a piece!} Bd7 {Clearing the B1 square for the Rook.} 7. a3 {A horrible waste of time. 7 B-K2 followed by O-O and Q-side development was in order.} Nh6 {Intending ...N-B4.} 8. b4 {Another time-wasting Pawn move. Now Morphy blasts open a line for his heavy artillery.} cxd4 {If White recaptures with the Pawn...} 9. cxd4 {...which he does...} Rc8 {...Morphy seizes the open file.} 10. Bb2 {Too little, too late. He should have started developing 3-4 moves ago.} Nf5 {Planting the Knight on a powerful outpost.} 11. Qd3 {Momentarily preventing ...N-K6.} Bxb4+ {Exploiting White's lack of development. If White had played 7 B-K2 and 8 O-O Morphy could not now initiate this sacrificial attack.} 12. axb4 {Virtually forced.} Nxb4 {Driving the Q. If 13 Q-Q1, Morphy has 13 ...N-B7 ch 14 Any QxB regaining the piece and leaving Black two Pawns up and White with a hopeless positional disadvantage.} 13. Qd2 {McConnell plays this move instead.} Rc2 {Now Morphy forces the Q back to Q1.} 14. Qd1 {To guard the QP. But...} Ne3 {White's Q is trapped! McConnell resigns at once.}
