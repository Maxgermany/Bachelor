[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 d6 {Already Doubrava is overcautious.} 2. Bc4 {Dadian, by contrast, plays aggressive chess.} Nd7 {Way too conservative. Also blocks the QB.} 3. Nf3 {Dadian develops quickly and efficiently.} g6 {Why? 3...P-K4 was definitely in order. Doubrava will choke to death if he doesn't claim some space.} 4. Ng5 {Threatens 5 BxP mate!} Nh6 {Forced.} 5. Bxf7+ {Sacrificing the Bishop...} Nxf7 {Forced again. But now...} 6. Ne6 {And Doubrava resigns. His Queen will fall. His lack of fight cost him severely in this game.}
