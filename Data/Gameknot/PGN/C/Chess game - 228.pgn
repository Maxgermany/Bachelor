1. d4 Nf6 {Rashid Nezhmetdinov is without doubt the greatest chess player ever to come from Central Asia. This game was part of a simultaneous exhibition.} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Bb5+ Nc6 8. d5 {Until this game was played, the usual response to this aggressive move was the one played in this game.} Qa5 9. Qa4 Qxc3+ 10. Ke2 Bd7 11. dxc6 bxc6 12. Bxc6 Rd8 {At the time this game was played, this position was thought to be in Black's favor. If White plays 13 R-QN1, Black plays 13... Q-Q6ch!!! and after 14 KxQ BxB dis ch, Black follows up with 15 BxQ and is up a Pawn.} 13. Qb3 {Nezhmetdinov has other ideas.} Qxa1 14. Bb2 Qb1 15. Nf3 Qxh1 {Now Black's Queen has been forced out of play.} 16. Ne5 e6 17. Bxd7+ Rxd7 18. Qb8+ {White avoids 18 Q-R4??? Q-Q8ch!!!, which would let Black steal victory from the jaws of defeat.} Rd8 19. Qb5+ Ke7 20. Qb7+ Kf6 {Now the King-hunt is on.} 21. Qxf7+ Kg5 22. Nf3+ Kh5 23. g4+ Kxg4 24. Qxe6+ Kf4 25. Be5+ Kxe4 26. Ng5# {A brilliant final attack.}
