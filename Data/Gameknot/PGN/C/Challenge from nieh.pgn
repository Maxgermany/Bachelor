Rxc1 Qxc1 {exchange rook for pawn - I was actually a pawn up her if I check the board} 42. Qf5+ {new this was comming} Kg8 {getting out of check, and he screwd up my plan by covering h7} 43. Qxb5 {i calculated for this, and new i was winning as my pawn was further up the board} Qe3+ {deffending the pawn with check and winning a tempo} 44. Kh4 d3 {josh again} 45. Qb3+ {this actually played into my plan here, I had a glimps of the mate earlier, but he nudged me there} Kh7 46. a4 {I could push Qe1 check and with tempo move the pawn d2,d1, and swop queens, but there is better, forced mate in 2} Qf2+ {The last two moves was conditional...} 47. Kh5 {only moved} g6# {A simple pawn move won the game here.  I got 2 things from the game, quitting is not an option, your opponent can always slip up and secondly that the obvious move is not always the correct or shortes one}
