1. e4 d6 2. d4 g6 3. f4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Bd3 {standard austrian attack. nothing special} c5 7. e5 {this is not to be recommended. theory indicates Nfd7 with confy game for black.} Nh5 {looks dim. but what to do?} 8. dxc5 {seems logical so far, not too pretty though.} dxe5 9. fxe5 {now this is, how should i put it? suicidal? Ne5 is the only way to maintain balance.} Nc6 {The situation: black will capture on e5, obtaining a dominating position in the centre. moreover, one cannot recommend a flank for the safety of the white king. not to mention the double pawns on the c file and the large black majority on the kingside. this is close to winning for black.} 10. Be3 {whatever..} Nxe5 11. Nxe5 Bxe5 12. Qd2 Be6 13. O-O-O Qa5 14. a3 {oh dear... bu what else?} Bxc3 15. Qxc3 Qxc3 16. bxc3 {now 3=1. only the pair of bishops and the somewhat untidy play of the opponent enabled white  to survive a bit more.} Nf6 17. Bd4 Bd5 {a bit too clever. going after the c pawns would have been better. now white has some chances to create countarplay} 18. Rhe1 Bxg2 19. Rxe7 Nd5 20. Rd7 Rad8 21. Rxd8 {enabling black cannot be good. both c6 and Rd6 are better.} Rxd8 22. Rg1 {inaccurate. white missed the sequence that follows.} Nf4 23. Be5 Rxd3 {nice little tactic.} 24. Bxf4 Rf3 25. Be5 {the worst spot. going after the a pawn with bb8 isnt great either but still. } Bh3 {black returns the favor. Rf5 is almost like money in the bank.} 26. Rd1 f6 27. Rd8+ Kf7 28. Bd4 Bf5 29. Rd6 Be6 {a mistake. black actually need the bishop on the a8-h1 diagonal. now the game becomes unbalanced. however, in zeitnot, white will not be able to keep up with the pace of the pawn race that will star soon after the next couple of moves.} 30. c6 bxc6 31. Rxc6 g5 32. Bxa7 h5 33. a4 g4 34. a5 h4 35. Bb8 g3 36. hxg3 hxg3 37. Rd6 g2 38. Rd1 Rf1 39. Bh2 Bg4 {}
