1. e4 {Typical move for a reason. This move controls the centre and gets the queen and bishop ready for action.} a5 {I don't see how this helps with development. Does anyone know?} 2. d4 h5 {Again, not a developing move.} 3. Nf3 {I have heard that it is a bad idea to do Nc3 after d4. Why?} Na6 {Knights are almost always best when pointing towards the centre.} 4. Bc4 {I decide to target the f-pawn.} Nh6 {At this point, one would say that white is much more able to launch an attack, though white would be unwise to attack without much support.} 5. O-O {I castle, putting my king into a safer position (which is generally the aim of castling).} g6 6. Bg5 {Is this OK, or is Bf4 better?} b5 {? Free pawn.} 7. Bxb5 Rb8 {Skewering my bishop to b2.} 8. Nc3 {Is this the best move?} f6 {As I feared after pressing 'Submit' on move 6.} 9. Bxh6 {Aiming for liquidation, but is this a bad move, because it trades a bishop for a badly placed knight and allows the DSB a more active role in the game?} Rxh6 {Better would be Bxh6.} 10. e5 {Trying to give my knight on f3 attacking space.} Bg7 11. e6 {Is this OK? dxe6 is illegal, as d7 is pinned.} c6 12. exd7+ {Check. My bishop still has time to move.} Qxd7 13. Bc4 {Bxa6 is probably better, due to Rxb2.} h4 {Why this move?} 14. h3 {? I had an irrational fear of a pawn storm, which is why I did this.} Rh5 {?? Loses a knight, as you will see.} 15. Qd3 {Black resigned here, facing either Bxa6 (winning the knight) or Qxg6+ (forking the king and rook). Feel free to comment and offer constructive criticism, and I hope that you learned something! ðŸ˜„}
