1. e4 e5 {In 1857, did you expect anything else?} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Standard stuff.} 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Book.} 4. b4 Bxb4 {Morphy loved to use the Evans as White, but he's unafraid of it as Black.} 5. c3 Ba5 {Book play.} 6. d4 exd4 {The usual line.} 7. e5 d5 {The usual 7th move for White is to castle. Morphy counters Marache's pawn advance with an aggressive counter of his own.} 8. exd6 e.p. Qxd6 {The exchange of central Pawns accentuates Morphy's development.} 9. O-O Nge7 {Morphy prepares to castle his King into safety. Marache's best line is probably 10 B-R3, driving Morphy's centralized Queen.} 10. Ng5 O-O {Morphy's King is now secure, and he can launch his attack.} 11. Bd3 Bf5 {Clearing the last minor piece off the back rank.} 12. Bxf5 Nxf5 {The exchange of minor pieces does nothing to slow Morphy's developing attack.} 13. Ba3 Qg6 {Marache wastes two moves going after an unthreatening Rook while letting Morphy's Queen assume a menacing post.} 14. Bxf8 Qxg5 {Morphy willingly gives up the exchange, as he has four active pieces in return while Marache's Q-side pieces are uselessly sitting on their original squares, unable to help the threatened King.} 15. Ba3 dxc3 {Fully clearing both center files for use as lanes of attack.} 16. Bc1 Qg6 {Keeping his Q pointed balefully at the King.} 17. Bf4 Rd8 {Seizing the freshly opened Q file.} 18. Qc2 Ncd4 {Threatening the Queen and closing in on the King.} 19. Qe4 Ng3 {Threatens NxQ and if the Q moves away, N/5-K7 mate. According to some sources, Marache resigned here.} 20. Qxg6 Nde2# {According to other sources, this elegant finish was how it ended. I don't know who's right, so I'll go with the beautiful checkmate.}
