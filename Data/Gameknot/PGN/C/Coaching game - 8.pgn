[Opening "Sicilian defence (B30)"]

1. e4 c5 {The Sicilian has many variations, sharp with tactics and replete with positional strategies. It is important to be at least familiar with this opening, especially if you play 1. e4 One way of tackling the Sicilian is to play a closed variation, 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 or 2. d6  These moves will not allow your opponent to play their "pet" Sicilian lines which they may know better than you. On the other hand the open variations have chances for White as well and can be more fun.  } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. g3 {An odd move here, but not necessarily terrible. g3 is often played in the closed lines when f4 can be played but Nf3 is more typically played in open positions. 3. d4 cd4 4. Nd4 would be an open game and allow black to chose his response. } g6 {Looking to contest control of the center via the diagonals. } 4. Bg2 Bg7 {The obvious moves. } 5. O-O {Tucking the king away to safety. Time to finish development on the queenside. } d6 {Strengthening the dark squares in the center and opening lines for the bishop. } 6. a4 {?! Possibly looking to bind the knight on the Queenside? Or start a queenside attack? Too early to try to force an attack, first the Queenside knight and bishop need to be developed. } Nf6 {Developing a piece, attacking e4, and preparing to castle. } 7. Ng5 {Defends e4 but leaves the knight exposed. There are no tactical attacks here for White who again needs to finish development first. 7. Nc3 or 7. Re1 protect the pawn and improve the position of White's pieces. } O-O {Black's position is safe and solid. He can now turn his mind to breaking down White's undeveloped position. } 8. c3 {Restricting the black bishop and controlling some of the center but the e4 pawn is still weak...} h6 {Creating problems for the knight and gaining a pawn. } 9. Nf3 {9. Nh3 Bh3 10. Bh3 Ne4} Nxe4 10. c4 {? Making way for the knight on c3 but the pawn did have advantages there, controlling the center and prohibiting both the bishop on g7 and the knight on c6. A move like d3 would allow the bishop and knight to be developed while attacking the knight on e4. } Bf5 {Not an extremely strong square for the bishop but looking to exert more pressure on the center after a possible d3 or d4. } 11. Nc3 Nxc3 {An earlier exchange on c3 with the black bishop would have been silly as this piece is very powerful for black and would give white the bishop pair. Now however Black can exchange the knight which, while a powerful centralized piece, exchanges away one of the few developed white pieces and doubles up White's pawns. White's position is in trouble now.  } 12. dxc3 Qd7 {Looking to exchange another powerful white piece, the bishop on g2. } 13. Nh4 {A good move, but a few too late. } Bh3 14. Qf3 Bxg2 {Exchanging the strong Light Squared Bishop and removing a defender around the King, but a more immediate ...Ne5 would be stronger. } 15. Nxg2 Ne5 {Attacking the queen while centralizing the knight.} 16. Qd5 {A dangerous square for White as it allows black to constrict White while attacking the queen. } e6 17. Qe4 Qc6 {Looking for a queen exchanging where the strong central pawns and knight will help black, but stronger is 17... d5! continuing to pressure White and firmly grasping the center after 18. cd5 ed5. } 18. Qf4 {The Queen needed to go to e2 after the first attack with the knight. Keeping it in the center continues to allow black to improve his position while attacking the queen. } Rad8 {Looking to control a central file after a d-pawn break. } 19. Be3 {?? Losing. Finally looking to develop the bishop, but it's scope is extremely reduced here, it only controls three squares. More importantly it blocks the Queen's escape!} g5 {! The Queen is trapped. } 20. Qxg5 {Loses faster, White could instead have taken the knight on e5. } Nf3+ {! A nice intermezzo. The Queen is still hanging, this move puts the White king on a dangerous file which will be half-open after ...hg5 and a dangerous diagonal with the Black Queen on c6.} 21. Kh1 hxg5 22. Rfd1 {After losing the Queen White's position is lost. The rest is technique from Black to finish quickly. } f6 {Looking to provide a square for the King so that the rooks can come to the h-file. } 23. a5 Kf7 24. b4 Rfh8 {Black need not worry about the Queenside as the fight is nearly over. } 25. h4 gxh4 26. Nxh4 Nxh4+ {The double-check allows black to set up the mate.  } 27. Kg1 Qg2# {}
