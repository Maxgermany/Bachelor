[Opening "Grob's attack (A00)"]

1. g4 {O no... a Grob approacheth.} g5 {Black responds in groblike manner.} 2. Bg2 {This is one of the recommended moves, h2-h3 being the other, which is not necessary yet because the d7 pawn has not moved.} d5 {Opens the bishop line from c8 to g4, targetting the lead pawn.} 3. h3 {Holding the pawn.} e6 {This move does not take as much center, but it does keep the d5 pawn strong at the expense of an e5 weakness.} 4. d4 {A bishop line opens for white, and an attack line for black by bishop - which can be refuted. White controls e5 which doesn't really even matter at this time.} h6 {Black overprotects the g5 pawn, but perhaps Nc6, or Bb4+ to achieve development would accomplish more. The queen has the pawn covered.} 5. e4 {White challenges the black hold on the center.} dxe4 {Black decides to open the center early, but is it too early?} 6. Bxe4 {The bishop has some influence here, but unfortunately can also be a target to the g8 knight, which will lose white some tempo in a retreat.} Nf6 {Black obtains the initiative.} 7. Bg2 {Returning back to base. The bishop has a nice line to b7 where it keeps the c8 bishop tied to defense until a blocking or protecting move is made by black. Neither side has any great advantages and the position appears about equal.} c5 {Black engages in some early pawn manuevers, perhaps with the intent on shifting white to a defensive position, while black attempts to press forward with Nb8-c6. But white will develop equally.} 8. Be3 {Develops a piece while defending. The knight on f6 can be a danger, so this move is not all that good. Nf6-d5! and white will feel the pressure. Ng1-e2 would have been better. This move gives black the advantage. Black stands a little better.} Nc6 {Black applies pressure to the d4 pawn. If d4xc5 then Q8xd1 is inevidable, but not wanted. Nf6-d5 appears better.} 9. Ne2 {Reinforcing d4 while developing. This also opens a possibility of kingside castling.} Be7 {Its a developing move, but Nf6-d5 is better.} 10. Nbc3 {White covers the d5 square, which protects the e3 bishop from attack, and develops a piece.} Nd7 {Not sure of the strategy here, perhaps just repositioning the knight to a better location in the event of d4xc5, then Nd7xc5.} 11. dxc5 {The pawn capture now because the queen at d8 is blocked.} Nxc5 {Recapturing and offering a reduction of 2 queens from the board.} 12. Qxd8+ {Taking it closer to the endgame.} Nxd8 {The best move. Better than Ke8xd8, and definitely better than Be7xf8 losing the c5 knight. A necessary move, but black devolves a little with 4 pieces on the back rank.} 13. b4 {The knight has few good squares and must flee the center.} Nd7 {Another piece lands in the pile. No fault of black on this move, it is just the way the position is playing out.} 14. a3 {Simply shoring up b4. Nc3-b5 with the intent of Nb5-c7+ was a thought, but black would see it coming and either castle or move the rook.} Ne5 {Black seeks useful squares for the knight, or at least safe ones. The problem is a discoordination of pieces. Both bishops need open lines - black has in effect 2 bad bishops because of the pawn structures of both players. Some pawn moves could break open some lines, but there is the danger of not having tied rooks that will present itself if not remedied. Another problem for black is underdevelopment of pieces.} 15. f4 {The knight will be forced to move yet again, costing tempo.} gxf4 16. Bxf4 {Recapturing and asking the knight to step-off.} Nc4 {Its a good foothold for the knight, but it is working alone.} 17. Nb5 {Remember the Nb5-c7+ fork threat - it is still there.} e5 18. Bh2 {Keeping the north-west line is preferable, so the bishop relocates to a safe position on that line.} Ne6 {A good move that prevents the fork at c7 and offers d4 or f4 at a later time to the knight.} 19. Bd5 {With the idea of removing the defender of c7.} Bd7 {With the idea of attacking the loose knight, but not so good because it only offers the appearance of an equal trade. White can capture and protect in one move. The turning point in the game.} 20. Bxc4 a6 {To dislodge the knight and limit the danger.} 21. Bxe5 {Creating a greater threat while gaining material.} O-O {Black obtains a better position while ghosting the rook from danger and keeping a counter attack pressed to the knight at b5!} 22. Nd6 {Pressing the position, prevents Ra8-c8.} Ng5 {An unfortunate move in that it prevents f7-f6 from play because of the bishop pin that is enabled. The knight lacks any good targets from here, but there are not really any better moves to be found.} 23. Rf1 {Adding a 3rd piece to the attack on f7, while casually offering the decoy pawn h3, which is not really expected to be taken, but provides a nice distraction to the opponents calculations. Also using a half open file.} Ne6 {Capping the north-east bishop line to f7.} 24. Nf5 {The best move for a knight, a fork!} Bg5 {It only appears good at 1 ply, but the protective move can be refuted.} 25. h4 {The bishop is attacked!} f6 {Black counter attacks, but the depletion of cover is felt under the pressing swarm of white pieces.} 26. Bd6 {The rook is attacked, while the bishop avoids harm, while a second attack remains at g5 on the bishop!} Rfc8 {Black counter attacks, but the move leaves an unguarded weakness - seen on the next move.} 27. Ne7+ {Another fork, with the strong effect of check!} Kf7 28. Nxc8 {A gain of material. It looks like the bishop at g5 will get away after Ra8xc8 because of the attack on the c4 bishop, but there is a rejoinder lurking.} Bxh4+ {Black pulls a sneaky and checks white who is taken by surprise because of not considering this response in calculations.} 29. Bg3 {Blocking the check while counter attacking the undefended bishop!} Rxc8 {Now the bishop must move.} 30. Bxe6+ {The check is forcing and will not allow the h4 bishop to escape capture!} Bxe6 31. Bxh4 {Capturing, but also setting up Rf1xf6+.} Rxc2 {A good place for a rook normally, but there is a matter of defense that has been overlooked.} 32. Rxf6+ {The problem of where to move is compounded by the move Kf7-e7 allows a revealed check when the rook moves, and the attempt of Kf7-e7, Rf6xh6+, Ke7-d7 or d6 is met by Ra1-d1+ and it gets worse from there.} Kg7 {A reluctant choice.} 33. Rxe6 Rc6 {Offering a trade, possibly in hopes of somehow achieving a draw.} 34. Re7+ {The best choice! All moves lead to mate, some quicker, but moving north prolongs the inevidable.} Kg6 {Self mating.} 35. Nf4# {A thanks to my friend Jim for accepting the challenge of the grob - I got lucky this time since this opening is inherently dangerous in the wrong hands (mine). It will probably backfire on me next time and instead of eating crow I will be eating grob...}
