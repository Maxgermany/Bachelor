[Opening "French (C02), advance, Wade variation"]

1. e4 {Hello everybody :) This time I would like to present a game played against my buddy vkoval, in which I will demonstrate how important it is to fully develop all of your pieces in the game. So, let's move on - hope you enjoy it!} e6 {I usually start with an "open" opening and this is a typical move my opponent is used to make against 1. e4.} 2. d4 {Moving on to French Defence, which is one of my most hated openings. I always seem to fall into trouble in this one.} d5 {Typical play by black. I usually play 3. e5 to avoid the exchange variation, in which I do not see any good attacking possibilities.} 3. e5 {As said.} c5 {Again, a typical move.} 4. c3 {Secures d4.} Qb6 {This move prevents white from activating it's bishop, since b2 is under attack.} 5. Nf3 {As far, everything according to the book. I was expecting 5. ... Nc6, however, my opponent played differently.} Ne7 {After this move I can develop my light-squared bishop. If vkoval had played 5. ... Nc6, this would not be possible since the d4 pawn would be left unguarded.} 6. Bd3 {This move also prevents 6. ... Nf5.} Nec6 {What? Wasn't d8-d6 a better way to develop? I think so, and now black has lost a tempo and blocked the c6 square with his other knight.} 7. Bc2 {Clears the path for the Queen to guard the d4 pawn. Also places the bishop strategically on a fully opened b1-h7 diagonal.} Nd7 {Hmm... This move brings the second knight into play, but blocks the path for the bishop as well. Morover, is there any place this knight could move on with the next move? Only to its origin square I guess.} 8. O-O {Castling brings the rook into play. My opponent is at least two moves from making a castle.} Be7 {He prepares for it nevertheless.} 9. b3 {This move unblocks white's dark squared bishop. It can now take an active spot on b2 or the c1-h6 diagonal.} f6 {Purpose of this move by black is to bring the d7 knight into the game.} 10. exf6 {White takes, otherwise the center is lost.} Nxf6 {Knight retakes and takes a good defensive spot.} 11. Bb2 {The bishop goes to b2 to secure the c3 and d4 pawns.} c4 {Hmm... again. This move doesn't bring much into black's position. White cannot take the pawn because of an unguarded bishop at b2. So, another piece is developed to attack the c4 pawn and force an exchange!} 12. Nbd2 {The second knight is developed.} Na5 {This may look as a good move, but it has certain drawbacks. Notice, how poorly black's pieces are developed on the queenside. Two of them are still on their starting spots, and the queen and the knight are being placed away from the center and play a rather defensive role.} 13. Rb1 {The rook comes to the rescue, giving a safety net for the dark-squared bishop, guarding b3 and attacking the queen.} cxb3 {Black trades the pawn.} 14. axb3 {White retakes, creating a strong pawn-chain on the queenside together with heavy guarding force behind it.} Nc6 {Black's knight retreats. This move looses another tempo and doesn't bring any good for black's development.} 15. Re1 {The second rook takes an active spot on the half-opened e-line. It also attacks the weakest black's pawn on e6.} Nd8 {The knight increaes protection of the pawn, but look how far from the center black has to defend itself.} 16. h3 {Defensive move, preventing intrusion on g4 and leaving a safe spot for the king.} O-O {Castling at last. But on the sixteenth move!} 17. Ne5 {This move by white was easy to predict but hard to stop. The knight will be very active and his other colleague will also rush to secure him.} Nf7 {Willing to exchange knights. Of course white has no intention to do this.} 18. Ndf3 {Secures the other knight. Right now, whites's position looks quite stable and well developed, while black is making only defensive moves. Notice, that black's bishop and rook on the queenside have never moved!} Qc7 {Increases preassure on e5 but leaves the e6 pawn practically unguarded.} 19. Qd3 {Now we're in for the big time. White's pieces have taken attacking positions. If black's knight on f6 falls, white can mate black's king.} Nd6 {Trying to occupy the e4 spot. This move however, leaves the g5 spot for white's knight unguarded.} 20. Ng5 {Black is in all sorts of trouble. After 21. Nxh6 black's defense must fall. To prevent this, black tries to block the b1-h7 diagonal with his knights.} Nfe4 {First knight goes into action.} 21. Nxe4 {And falls.} dxe4 {Clever move, but white has other plans.} 22. Rxe4 {22. Rxe4! White gives up a rook to open the diagonal for the killer battery. Let's see how the game progresses.} Nxe4 {Second knight goes for the e4 spot.} 23. Qxe4 {And falls as well. Later after the game, we have discussed with vkoval that black could probably hold on (a little longer I guess, but who knows) by playing 23. ... g6 24. Nxg6 Rf7 25. Ne5 Rg7. Black played something different...} Rf5 {Another piece blocks the path, however it can be easily removed.} 24. g4 {It looks like it's curtains, however vkoval has other plans than quitting.} Rxe5 {24. ... Rxe5! Nice move! It looks like black can get back into the play after white kills the rook, but I have noticed that my pieces are developed really nice and it is possible to end the game right now. I must admit, that during the last few moves I have encouraged vkoval (thanks!) to play on to show that the mate is really a fact.} 25. Qxh7+ {Forces the king to f8.} Kf8 {The only possible move.} 26. Bg6 {Black must now remove his bishop to prevent mate.} Bc5 {It doesn't really matter if black moves his bishop along the a3-f8 or the h4-d8 diagonal. White follows with the attack.} 27. Qh8+ {Forcing the king to e7.} Ke7 {The only spot.} 28. Qxg7+ {Forcing the king to move to the d line. Black will try to avoid moving to d6 because of dxe5 , leaving the queen unprotected.} Kd8 {Black chooses to run to the 8-rank.} 29. Qg8+ {White forces him back.} Ke7 {Black goes back to rank 7.} 30. Qe8+ {Again, black has two choices - d6 or f6 spots. Either one is bad.} Kd6 {Black chooses d6.} 31. dxe5+ {On with the plan.} Kxe5 {The rook comes into play.} 32. Re1+ {32. c4  was also possible, but black could hide his king with 32. ... Bd4.} Be3 {Blocks the check.} 33. c4+ {Let's check again.} Kd6 {Mate is close. Hang on just a little more!} 34. Rd1+ {Another check, black decides to give up and not to block the check with his bishop.} Kc5 {Last move made by black's king.} 35. Qb5# {The game ends with white checkmating black. All of white's pieces played a role in this attack, while most of black's resources were left untouched and played a static role. So, remember to develop your pieces!!! Many thanks for vkoval for his patience in the final stages of the game. Dzieki stary :)}
