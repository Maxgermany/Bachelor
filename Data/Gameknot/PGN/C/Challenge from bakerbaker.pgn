[Opening "Sicilian (B52), Canal-Sokolsky attack, Bronstein gambit"]

1. e4 {This is the move that best follows the rule, "develop your kingside and castle as soon as possible."} c5 {Although this doesn't follow the rule of developing the kingside as well as 1...e5 does, it still controls the centre, opens up a development line for the queen, and strengthens the queenside. So because of these imbalances, 1...c5 is just as good as the principled 1...e5, if not better.} 2. Nf3 {The most logical developing move, because my knight will be good on this square no matter what Black does. Developing the bishop instead is bad because it's too early to decide where the bishop should be developed, and developing the other knight is unsharp because it doesn't develop the kingside for castling.} d6 {I think 2...e6 is a more accurate move for Black here, because it opens more lines for development than 2...d6, Black can castle faster, and a d7-d5 advance is likely to occur.} 3. Bb5+ {This is why I don't think 2...d6 is a good move. It allows me to trade my bad bishop for either Black's good bishop, or his important knight.} Bd7 {I think Nd7 is Black's best chance to get equality. Nc6 is worse than Bd7, because after Bxc6, Black has doubled pawns and a cramped position, making it hard for him to develop his pieces to active squares.} 4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 5. O-O {Now I have a slight lead in development, but Black has control of the dark squares, so I need to make some sort of central breakthrough to get an advantage.} Nf6 6. Re1 {I thought this move was sharper than Nc3.} g6 {I thought Nc6 is a sharper move here. Even though it doesn't develop the kingside like g6 does, g6 is a little more passive, and can be played later.} 7. e5 {I exploit Black's passivity.} dxe5 8. Nxe5 {Now I have the initiative, and must use it wisely.} Qc7 {Maybe Qd8 is better, because it controls the open d-file and is much safer.} 9. d4 {I thought for awhile on this move, because I plan on sacrificing a pawn for easier development and more central control.} cxd4 10. c3 {The gambit.} dxc3 11. Nxc3 {I have a lot of compensation for the pawn. My heavy pieces are strong on their open files, I have a lot more control of the centre, and I have a feeling Black's queen won't be comfortable for long.} Bg7 12. Bf4 {In this gambit opening, it's common for Black's queen to be harassed by tactical threats.} Qb6 {It's hard for Black's queen to find a safe square.} 13. Nc4 {I thought about Na4, but I wanted that knight to go to b5.} Qd8 {Black can afford to trade queens now, because I'm no longer threatening Qxd8  Kxd8 Nxf7  winning an exchange.} 14. Nb5 {Trading queens only makes Black's game easier, since he has an extra pawn. But now if Black tries to trade queens, I have the "in-between move" Nc7  and can win Black's rook after I recapture the queen.} Na6 {14...Nd5 ends in total disaster. Try to see why.} 15. Nbd6+ {I take away Black's right to castle, while forking his pawn.} Kf8 16. Nxb7 {Now if queens are traded, I'll be much better because I won't be down a pawn, and I'll still have the compensation giving up the pawn gave me on move 10.} Qc8 17. Nba5 {Moving the other knight to a5 may have been better because then I'd have Rc1.} h6 {There isn't much Black can do in this position without getting tactically destroyed, so I guess he plans to castle by hand and hope he finishes development before my already active forces reach maximum attacking potential, but he has overlooked my next move. If you can guess what it is, give yourself a pat on the back.} 18. Rxe7 {Tactics like this are common in positions where the tactic victim is underdeveloped or has a weak king. Notice that this sacrifice cannot be accepted because of Kxe7 Qd6  Ke8 Re1  Qe6 Rxe6  fxe6 Qxe6  and Black will be mated after Kf8 Bd6# or Kd8 Nc6#, so Black must accept the loss of a pawn.} Kg8 19. Nd6 {More tempo gains.} Qc5 {My knight is under attack, but I don't have to play passively because of it, I can simply make a bigger tactical threat to counter the attack on my knight.} 20. Qb3 {Now it's mate in 2 if Black takes my knight.} Kh7 21. Rxf7 {This is where Black signed his own death warrant. He thinks he can leave his f-pawn hanging because he's attacking my knight, but I have more tactics.} Qxa5 {My next winning move probably isn't hard to see by White, but can be easily overlooked by Black.} 22. Rxg7+ {Black must be pissed now that he took my free knight.} Kxg7 {It's over now.} 23. Qf7# {Black is blocked in by his own undeveloped rook.}
