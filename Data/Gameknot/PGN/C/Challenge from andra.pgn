1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {Ponziani's Opening is not seen very often, although it isn't bad if white doesn't mind letting black equalize easily.} d5 {Not knowing the theory offhand, I came up with the less common of the two main lines. According to MCO-13 the more common main line would be 3...Nf6.} 4. exd5 {And here we go out of book. The main line is 4. Qa4 and there is a sideline starting with 4. Bb5. The problem with the text move is that black has already achieved his strategic opening goal. In an e4 opening, black is trying to get in d5 to attack white's center and liquidate the e4 pawn. On move 4, black has already equalized.} Qxd5 5. d3 {And it is now black that has the better center pawn (on the 4th rank, while white's center pawn is on the 3rd). I will try to exploit this space advantage, while avoiding trades that will ease white's cramped position.} Bg4 {Preparing to castle long.} 6. Be2 {Preparing to castle short and breaking the pin.} O-O-O {Threatening to either win a pawn or wreck white's kingside pawns with 7...Bxf3. White's choices would be: A) 8. gxf3 and white isn't going to want to castle kingside anymore B) 8. Bxf3 Qxd3 and black wins a pawn} 7. Nh4 {Avoiding the previous lines, but putting the knight out of play. White does offer to trade his bad bishop for black's good bishop. And trades will lessen the value of black's space advantage.} Bxe2 {Nevertheless I trade, expecting white will not want to drop the pawn and will recapture with the king. White can still castle by hand after that, but it takes time, and time is precious in a semi-open opening.} 8. Qxe2 {And quite surprisingly, white sacrifices the d pawn. I don't see much compensation for it, but I'm sure white had some reason for doing it.} Qxd3 9. Qg4+ {Avoiding the queen trade, but this gives my king the tempo he needs to get to b8. He would have had to get there sooner or later anyway.} Kb8 10. Be3 {As white cannot castle due to the black queen's control of the f1 square, white continues with development of the queenside.} h5 {I notice that if the white queen leaves the h5-d1 diagonal, I have mate with ...Qd1#. So this pawn move is an attempt to take away squares on that diagonal from the queen.} 11. Qe2 {And the white queen finds a safe square that continues to defend the mate.} Be7 {I don't want to initiate a queen trade, when his king recapture would help the h1 rook develop, so I develop a piece of my own. Notice that white still cannot castle kingside, as that would hang the queen.} 12. Qxd3 {So white initiates the trade.} Rxd3 13. Nf5 {Getting the knight back into the game, but I think white would have been better to continue developing with either Nd2, O-O, or even Ke2. Now that the queens are off, it is not as important to castle. There is still plenty of firepower on the board, but if a pair of rooks go away, the centralized white king will be better in the coming endgame than my king over in the corner.} g6 {I don't fear Nxe7, as ...Ngxe7 will complete my development and allow me to double rooks on the d file. True the pawn structure favors bishops over knights, but sometimes you have to accept a trade-off. I would rather lose my bishop and activate my rooks to take advantage of my extra pawn.} 14. Nxe7 {And white no doubt thinks his bishop will be superior to my minor pieces in the endgame.} Ngxe7 15. Nd2 {Continuing to develop.} f5 {And I change tacks. Instead of doubling rooks with ...Rhd8, which can be nicely answered by O-O-O, I decide to attack the bishop who has few escape squares.} 16. O-O-O {Castling long anyway. Can't argue with that!} b6 {And now ...f4 wins the bishop, as the text takes away the last escape square.} 17. Nc4 {Giving the bishop a place to go and challenging for the d file.} Rxd1+ {Trying to maintain control of the d file with ...Rhd8 runs into the pin 18. Bg5, and I just didn't like the looks of that.} 18. Rxd1 {Now after ...f4, the bishop has to go to d2 and block the file. That will allow me to play Rd8 and challenge back for control.} f4 19. Nxe5 {Except that white doesn't save the bishop. He takes a pawn instead and now has two pieces en prise.} fxe3 {Given the choice, I take the bishop. The problem with this is that after he trades knights, he will win the e pawn and actually be a pawn to the good. I think it would have been better to play Nxe5 and maintain a material advantage.} 20. Nd7+ {Except that he doesn't play to win the pawn, he plays to check my king. And for what purpose? I don't see it, but I'm sure he had an idea.} Kc8 {And now my king is just as centralized as white's, and I add another defender to the d8 square.} 21. fxe3 {White gets the e pawn, but has given up a piece for it. Now my material advantage should begin to tell.} Rd8 {Attacking the knight a second time, so it must move or be lost. The only safe square is f6, and after that I will trade rooks and use my extra knight to try to win the endgame.} 22. Nxb6+ {Except that white sacrifices a second piece for a pawn. I don't understand what he was thinking here. That is just too much material to give away without some concrete reason.} axb6 23. Rxd8+ {And now he trades his last piece? Might as well resign as play that move.} Kxd8 24. b4 {As we enter the endgame I take a look at the board and decide where I want my pieces to be. Obviously the e pawn must be blockaded (and that is best done with a knight). The other striking feature of the position is that if I arrange my knights so they defend each other and can't be attacked by a pawn, they can never be forced to move (the white king can't take either one). With these points in mind I decide I want knights on e5 and c6. The e5 knight will protect the base of the kingside pawn chain on g6. The only problem is that I need to make sure that once I get a knight to c6, white can't play b5 and kick at it. But I have an idea of how to do that.} Ne5 {Step one: blockade the passed e pawn and protect the kingside pawn chain.} 25. Kd2 {Centralizing the king is always good in an endgame.} c5 {Hoping for bxc5 when white can no longer control the c6 square. What would I have done if white had pushed b5? I don't know, but I'm sure I would have found a way for my knights to control the game.} 26. bxc5 {And I get my wish as white relinquishes control of c6.} b5 {And now the e5 knight has a square to jump to (c4) if he needs an outpost later in the game.} 27. e4 {To allow the king access to e3.} Ne7c6 {And I complete my plan. Now my king can go pick off white's isolated pawns.} 28. Ke3 {Continuing to centralize, but where can he go, and what will he do when he gets there?} Kc7 {Heading for the a pawn.} 29. a3 {And it comes to meet me :)} Kb7 30. h3 {Either played to take away the g4 square from the e5 knight or to prepare g4 after Kf4.} Ka6 31. Kf4 {And now white can play g4, but if so, I will just play ...hxg4. White still has no way to create a passed pawn on the kingside.} Ka5 {And my king is starting to get very active on the queenside.} 32. Ke3 {It is too late to save the a pawn, so this retreat must be to protect the c3 pawn.} Ka4 33. Kd2 Kxa3 {And now winning the c3 pawn would make my b pawn a passer.} 34. Kc2 {White will try to defend the pawn the best he can.} Nc4 {And the outpost I mentioned a while back becomes useful. This move has two points: 1. it threatens ...Ne3  winning the g pawn 2. it allows ...N6e5 when the new e5 knight blockades both the e and c pawns to allow the c4 knight to do other things} 35. h4 {White has to move something.} Nc6e5 {I could have won the g pawn with a fork here, but I really would rather win the c3 pawn, and white is getting close to zugzwang.} 36. g3 Ka4 {And white is in zugzwang. Three pawns can't even move, the other two will be captured if they move, so it is up to the king to move. But his only safe squares are on the first rank, and this will allow my king the b3 square winning the c3 pawn. Notice that ...Ka2 would have been just as good.} 37. Kb1 {Rather than resign, white picks a square.} Kb3 {And now the c3 pawn falls with a black queen soon to appear.} 38. Ka1 Kxc3 39. Ka2 b4 {And white sees there is no way to stop the queen and resigns. 0-1}
