1. d4 {This was a non rated game for tutoring purposes, between myself, Scott Miller (faithfulltrav) and my friend Satya (zoooom).} Nf6 {I was looking to play one of the Indian Defenses.} 2. Nc3 {So much for Indian defenses!} d5 3. Nf3 e6 4. Bf4 c5 {I was testing to see if you would fall for playing 4. Nb4? Qa5+. After the game, I noticed another game with Basheer where you fell for it. The game was titled "test" and looked almost identical to this game. Is this a coincidence?} 5. e3 a6 6. Bg5 Nc6 7. Ne5 cxd4 8. Nxc6 {You should attempt to avoid moving the same piece repeatedly in the opening! You moved your DSB twice and the K-Knight 3 times only to trade him off. This gives me a nice lead in development.} bxc6 9. exd4 Be7 {At this point, with me playing with the black pieces, I should be a 1/2 move behind in development. Yet you have made 3 development moves, while I have 5. Do you see how I come up with this calculation?} 10. Bd3 Qb6 11. O-O {So your b pawn was undefended, then you left your d pawn undefended with Bd3. So I fork them! Always look at what is defended or attacked for both sides.} Qxd4 12. Bxf6 {You said, "I took your King Knight (12 Bxf6), as it could have been a threat in the later stage of the game. Was it right from my part?"  I don't see why the knight would be a greater threat than the bishop. I normally don't like to give my bishop for a knight. This is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped, closed positions, while bishops are stronger in open positions. So, you have to consider each game individually, but generally, as pieces get traded off, closed positions become open positions in the middle game and end game. As the position opens up, the bishops become stronger and stronger. So, although both pieces are technically the same value, the bishops are my piece of choice. I would not have traded if I were you. Now I have 2 bishops to go into the endgame, while you have a bishop and a knight. That may be just a personal thing though, because while most strong chess players agree with me, I've met some who disagree.} Bxf6 13. Qd2 {Playing 13. Qd2 is not a bad move, but you have to be careful as the queen is undefended and the bishop is pinned.} c5 {Since I am now threatening to attack the pinned Bishop, you ought to defend the queen (with a rook) on your next move.} 14. Rab1 c4 15. Ne2 {Nice maneuver, but still loses a piece! You mentioned in the notes you preferred to keep the bishop, so you gave up the knight. Fine, but a lost piece is still usually a lost game. You should not have given me either one.} Qc5 16. b4 Qc6 17. Nd4 Bxd4 18. Be2 Bf6 19. Bf3 {Now you only have a LSB. So I keep my pawns on light squares to restrict him.} Qb5 20. Rfe1 O-O 21. Qf4 Bd7 22. Qd6 {I understand you doing this, because you have to try something. But there is really no way for you to get in to attack, especially with a lonely queen! She needs backup, but every thing else is blocked out!} Rab8 23. a3 Rb6 {So, your right it is a lost game and resigning normally is in order, but because it is a tutoring game, I would suggest playing games out as there may be something else I could have shown you later in the game.   Thanks for the game though!  God Bless, Scott}
