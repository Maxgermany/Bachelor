1. Nf3 {Training game. The comments with the players' names in brackets were made during the game.} d5 2. g3 c5 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. d3 Nf6 5. O-O e5 6. Nbd2 Be7 7. e4 {(brulla) Now the typical King's Indian Attack-development is finished and the middle game is about to start.} O-O {(easy19) Looking at this position the plan must be simple Concidering i wil do the 0-0 in the next few moves And most of your pieces already directed onto mij kings wing. it is good to concentrate on the e4 e5 and f4 f5 squares with as ultimate goal launching an attack on my kings wing.} 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. c3 Be6 10. Qe2 Qc7 11. Nc4 f6 12. d4 cxd4 13. cxd4 b5 14. dxe5 Nc3 15. Qc2 Bxc4 16. Qxc3 fxe5 17. Nxe5 {brulla: In the post mortem analysis, this seems risky and together with white's next move thebase for black's mate attack. Something more solid and developing seems better: 17.Rd1} Nxe5 18. Bxa8 {brulla: This takes away an active piece of white for a passive piece of black. Tempting, but not good.} Rxa8 {(easy19) I like to maintain some mobility on the board.. I think i have got that now.. and after the exchange i can build op pretty good pressure on your kings position.. or depending on your moves go for a nasty queen hunt...} 19.
