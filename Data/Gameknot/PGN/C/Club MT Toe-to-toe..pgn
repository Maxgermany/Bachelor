[Opening "English (A30), symmetrical, hedgehog system"]

1. c4 {English Opening - so far at least.  The thing can transpose into all sorts of other openings, yet retains an independent significance of its own.  For years it was my favourite OTB (over-the-board) opening move.} c5 {Symmetrical English.  Often leads to slow, positional manoeuvring.  Yeah.  Right.} 2. Nf3 {On other occasions I've played 2.Nc3 or 2.g3, both popular and playable lines.} Nc6 {Played about as often as 2...Nf6.  Also playable is 2...g6, and even 3...b6 has been tried several times.} 3. d4 {(!?) A departure from my usual modus operandi.  Normally I would play 3.Nc3 or 3.g3, but today I thought I'd play something a bit different.  This thrust is as popular as the alternatives.} cxd4 {Almost a 'gimme'.  On rare occasions other moves have been tried, with some success, but there seems to be no reason not to take White's centre pawn for a centre-flank one.} 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {Also playable is 4...g6, and 4...e6 is worth considering.  Quite a few other moves have been tried here, with varying success: ...Qb6!?, ...e5!?, even ...f5, among others even more obscure.} 5. Nc3 {Normal.  Also playable is 5...g3.  You might have noted that my comments so far have been fairly repetitive.  What this shows is that there is plenty to select from in this opening.  It is very flexible, and, may I say, forgiving.} e6 {Probably safest.  Had Black played 5...g6, I would almost certainly have replied 6.e4, transposing the game into a type of Sicilian Defence with a Moroczy Bind - where White's c- and e-pawns put a crimp in Black's counter-actions in the centre and Q-side.} 6. g3 {Still 'Book'.  Also playable here was the more aggressive and adventurous 6.Ndb5, seeking to exploit the dark square weaknesses that have appeared at d6 and c7.  Something like this might have occurred: 6.Ndb5 d5  7.Bf4 e5 8.cxd5 exf4  9.dxc6 bxc6  10.Qxd8ch Kxd8 11.Rd1ch (or 0-0-0ch) with a game hard to call. But keep this knight move in mind...! +++++ Also possible was 6.a3, which has been tried, presumably to inhibit ...Bb4, and maybe with an idea, somewhere down the track,  of a general advance on the Q-side.} Qb6 {Quite a popular move here.  Also playable are [A] 6...Bc5, attacking the d4-knight and indirectly, f2:  7.Nb3 Bb4 8.Bg2, OR [B] 6... Bb4  7.Bg2.  In neither line does White concern himself overmuch about the possibility of ...Bxc3, doubling and isolating the c-pawns.  I suspect the central squares under their control would be the more significant positional factor, at least early in the middle game.} 7. Ndb5 {Issuing a challenge.  Less popular than the more supple 7.Nb3, it is much the more aggressive line.  You might recall that this move was playable earlier.} Bc5 {Challenge accepted!  Now we're for it.  The move attacks f2, and although 8.e3 would mask the weak spot, the weakened light squares and shut-in Queen's bishop would be a high price to pay.  So what should White do?} 8. Bg2 {[!] White ignores the threat.  It so happens there was an alternative defence: 8.Nd6ch Ke7  9.Nde4 Nxe4  10.Nxd4 with an OK game for White.  But I still prefer the fighting text move!} Bxf2+ {Interesting!  At this point the GK engine calls the game dead even.  The GK World database has 10 examples of this line up to White's 8th move, but only one in which Black played this checking capture.  The other tries were: 8...a6 (6); 8...d5 (2); 8.Ne5 (1 - though this probably transposed into something else in the database).} 9. Kf1 {There was nothing attractive about 9.Kd2.} Ng4 {Homing in upon f2, and looking at e3 and h2 as well.  Among other nastinesses, I was now faced with the possibility of ...Nxh2+; Rxh2 Bxg3 with the rook attacked and mate in one threatened.  What to do?} 10. Qd6 {Counter-attack! - but a dual-purpose move, too.  White threatens a fork (double attack) by Nc7ch, but at the same time defends the g3 square.  This puts paid to 10...Nxh2ch, which would simply lose a piece.  } Kd8 {Stops White's Nc7ch threat.  Now a battle rages for the initiative.  For the moment Black's attack has stalled, but White has to take energetic measures to seize and keep the initiative.} 11. Na4 {Driving the Queen from the critical diagonal seems a good place to start.} Qa5 {[?] Up to here, this game has been played before: A Greenfeld (2530) vs V. Yemelin (2485), 1998.  Here Black played 11.Qa6  12.h3 Qxa4 13.hxg4 ..., and the game was eventually drawn.  Had I played 12.h3 now, we would simply have transposed into that game - for a while, at any rate. It is possible that Jo thought her move was a refinement that kept c7 covered.   But the GK engine calls this a mistake, suggesting instead 11...Ne3ch 12.Bxe3 Qxe3 though after 13.Rd1, White can contrive pressure down the d-file.  It seems as though that White would have got only the smallest of edges in this line.} 12. Bg5+ {[!] A really subtle move, made possible by Black's 11th move (as you will discover), and whose import becomes clear only after another four moves.  This is why all threats, however easily defended, must be taken seriously. With her response, Black bats the bishop away with ease, but in so doing weakens the defence of her e-pawn.  Why that is significant, you will see.} f6 {Forced!  But it looks pretty effective!} 13. Bd2 {Back to d2, to attack the Queen and draw the Queen on to the a4-square... Of course, White could have played this a move earlier, but then e6 would have been rock solid...  Either way, the difference between 11...Qa6 and 11...Qa5 is revealed.  With the Black Queen on a6, this move would not have been available, and White would probably have had to choose between  12.h3 and 12.Nc7 (i.e. instead of Bg5ch).} Qxa4 {Wins a piece... for the time being...} 14. b3 {Suddenly the Black Queen is being squeezed, with few available squares - right now, precisely one!  } Qa6 15. Nc7 {And now the double attack is against Queen and Rook...} Qb6 16. Nxe6+ {But in fact it was a triple attack - a trident!  Here is the point of White's 12th move.  Nor can Black escape another 'fork'...} Ke8 17. Nc7+ Kf7 {Probably best.  The d8-square has not been comfortable lodgings for the Black King!} 18. Nxa8 {I did spend a lot of tine looking at 18.Bd5ch here, but nothing seemed to come of it.  I decided it could wait for a more opportune time.  Taking the rook is pretty much the end point of White's combination, and now would have been the moment for Black to see about picking up the initiative.  That her Queen was under immediate attack, however, rather limited her options.} Qd8 {[?] This crucial mistake was the turning point of the game.  Instead. 18...Ne3ch 19.Bxe3 Qxe3 20.Bf3 Ne5 21.Nc7 Nxf3 22.Qd5ch Kg6  23.exf3 ... would have kept Black in the fight, the exchange down, sure, but still with an active game.} 19. Bd5+ {Now was the time to drive the enemy King into the open...} Kg6 {Not 19...Ke8?? 20.Nc7ch, winning the Queen.} 20. Qf4 {[?!] I thought long and hard about this move, looking for a forcing King Hunt sequence that wasn't there.  The GK engine calls this a mistake, but White retains a winning edge, even so (+5.19 went down to +3.31).  Instead 20.h3 would have won a piece after 20...Be3 21.hxg4 Bxd2  22.Be4ch Kf7  23.Qd5ch Ke7  24.Qxd2.} h5 {(?) Returning the compliment.  Instead, 20...d6 would have 'saved' the piece, by picking up the knight at a8 in exchange for one of the advance pieces.} 21. h3 Bd4 {Hoping that the counter-attack against the a1-rook will save the knight?} 22. hxg4 {No.} Bxa1 {Overlooking ... or else probably figuring that anything else was equally hopeless...} 23. Qf5# {An abrupt end to a real toe-to-toe battle.  A strange feature of this game is that none of the rooks voluntarily stirred from its home square.}
