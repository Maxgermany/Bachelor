[Opening "Two knights defence (C55)"]

1. e4 e5 {Another open game.  I'd like to just play out my opening along the lines of the database and put my proper thinking cap on when things start to play out differently.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {Two Knight's defence} 4. Nc3 {If I had been doing my research I might have played Nxe4. Instead, I stick with the most popular move in the database.} Bc5 5. h3 d6 6. Ng5 O-O 7. d3 a6 8. O-O {We are almost a mirror image at this point.} b5 9. Bd5 Bb7 10. a3 a5 {I know that I've given up my b pawn, but I expect I'll win his e pawn...} 11. Nxb5 Nxd5 12. exd5 Ne7 13. Qh5 {That's bold! My little game with his e pawn needs to be put on hold, and I'm starting to regret it.} h6 14. Ne4 {If he plays Bxh6 then I'm in danger of checkmate with my king exposed and his queen and knight attacking.} f5 {If his bishop comes in to strip away my defensive pawns, then this allows my rook to defend the f6 square. It also threatens his very dangerous knight.} 15. Ng3 f4 {Bishop is blocked for now.} 16. Ne4 Nxd5 {I may have a problem... If he takes my bishop with Nxc5 then his queen will start gobbling up my pawns.} 17. Nd2 Nf6 18. Qg6 Qc8 {I'm formulating a plan to assassinate his queen.  Something along the lines of 19... Bc6. 20 Nc3 Be8. 21 Q???. He can prevent it right here by playing Ne4.} 19. Re1 Bc6 {Last chance to save the queen...} 20. a4 Be8 21. Nxc7 Bxg6 {nom nom} 22. Nxa8 Qxa8 23. Nf3 Rc8 24. c3 Bxd3 25. Nh4 Ne4 26. Bd2 Bxf2+ {Time to resign}
