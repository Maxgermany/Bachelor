1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 {White drags the queen out early, threatening black's e pawn while setting himself up for a four move checkmate.  Black feels obligated to protect the pawn before spending time chasing the white queen.  The nice thing about coming out with the queen (for black) is that white may end up moving the queen many time while black develops his position.  White, however, is far too smart for that.  Despite the early queen gambit he plays very well.} d6 3. Bc4 {Oh, oh.  White seeks an early end to the game with QxPf7#.  Doesn't seem very sporting.} g6 4. Qf3 {White has developed two pieces, while black has none.  White's move threatens with the same game, same QxPf7#.} Nh6 {Black protects the pawn, though opens himself up to further threat with Pd, BxN.} 5. h3 {White pushes the h pawn to prevent Ng4 or Bg4.  Black is still thinking about the f pawn.} Nc6 {Time to get more material out first, however.} 6. c3 {White is heading off further knight moves.} Na5 7. Na3 {Yes, we will trade a knight for the bishop that threatens our king, even though it leaves white with two developed pieces and black with just one knight off in a corner.} Nxc4 8. Nxc4 Be6 {White could counter the BxN threat by moving the queen to d3, or pushing a pawn.  Neither of these helps develop pieces, but moving the knight at least keeps white's pawns from doubling.} 9. Ne3 c6 10. b3 d5 11. Bb2 d4 {A pawn exchange will push the knight.} 12. cxd4 exd4 {Black suddenly realizes BxRh8 is a possibility, and remains a threat much of the rest of the game.} 13. Nc4 c5 14. Ne5 {This is the fifth time white has moved that knight.  KxPf7 forks black's queen and rook, except first white must encourage black to move his knight at h6.} Qg5 15. b4 {?  White sacrifices the knight?  Except now black's queen will be potentially pinned against the h8 rook.  Black frets about this for many moves to come.} Qxe5 16. Ne2 O-O-O {Black has a lot of high powered protection on the d pawn, not enough low power.  The threatened c pawn can easily be replaced with black's black bishop, which then adds protection to the h rook via the d rook.  The d rook's cover isn't worth much in terms of a bishop/rook exchange, however.  The key idea is that black is exerting more control over the center of the board.} 17. bxc5 {Bye bye, pawn!} Bxc5 18. Rc1 {Now black's black bishop is pinned, but by a higher ranking piece, and it is protected besides.  Finally, white doesn't have an adjacent pawn to press upon black's pinned bishop.  Black can just leave it there for the time being and focus on more interesting matters.} Kb8 {Black opts to regain bishop maneuverability.} 19. a4 f5 {Black pushed this pawn because, in the back of his mind, he was thinking he could attack white's knight with the d pawn.  Yes, the same d pawn protecting the queen and rook from the white's black bishop.  It was a stupid idea.} 20. exf5 Nxf5 21. O-O b6 22. Rfe1 {Black returns white's potential threat against the queen with an immediate threat from black's white bishop.} Bd5 23. Qd3 {The hope is to exert eventual control over the white king's pawns. } Bd6 {Yeah, baby.  How does Qh2# grab you?  Of course, the threat is easily parried.} 24. g3 Qe4 {White is almost forced into a queen exchange now.} 25. Qxe4 Bxe4 26. Nxd4 {The trade was bad for black.  The white bishop is undefended.  Black plays out numerous exchanges, none of which turn out favorably.  What black overlooks with his next move is Nc6+, ending in NxR or BxR.  Black is just sick about this, worrying about it all night, after his retarded Bc5 move.} Bc5 27. Rxe4 {Glory be!  White snags the "free" bishop.  Black rejoices white overlooked Nc6+ (and a cheap rook--white's choice of h8 or d8), and removes the knight fork threat with NxN.} Nxd4 28. Bxd4 Rxd4 {Black could have opted for BxB, but white seems in a trading mood and each trade makes black's bishop increase in value.  White could protect the rook with Pf3, but that won't stop RxPd2.  If white defends the d pawn, the a pawn falls.  RxR is the best deal.} 29. Rxd4 Bxd4 30. Kg2 Rd8 31. f4 Bb2 {Forcing white to a more favorable position seems, in hind sight, unwise.} 32. Rc2 Ba3 {Bb4 and the white pawn falls.  Black expects white to attack his pawns, except the black king guards against Rc7.  Black believes a rook exchange will let him promote the a or b pawn before white's king can accompany his pawn troop past black's g & h pawn. } 33. Kf3 Bb4 34. Ke3 Kb7 35. d4 Re8+ {Black doesn't want the white king escorting the d pawn down the board.} 36. Kf3 Be1 37. g4 Re7 38. d5 Ka6 39. f5 g5 40. f6 Rf7 41. Ke2 Bb4 42. Rc6 Bc3 {?  Black was momentarily blinded by his focus on P f6.  This blunder ultimately cost the game.} 43. Rxc3 Rxf6 44. Ke3 Rf4 45. d6 Rf7 46. Ke4 {}
