1. e4 {maddie and myself jst enjoy a good game, and after a overpowering defeat by maddie, i had my knife in for him:) This game, i rate one of my best games to date, and im sure he wouldnt mind if i share it.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {usually i would do Bf7, but doing it against sumone who know my game, is jst suicide} h6 4. d4 {i want to loose centre pawns} exd4 5. Qxd4 {Bringing out a queen aint good for development, because the oponent use it against you to develop his own pieces, like maddie will do now...} Nc6 6. Qe3 {so...i loose a developing move, by defending the queen} Nf6 7. Nc3 Ng4 {the target is the queen again! sometimes i think that when you threaten pieces to early in a game, then they go into hiding...and then you loose the position you could have used for a more effective attack, a move or two later...} 8. Qe2 Qf6 {the queen that he brought out, could be threatend by Nd5....also checkout C7....a poison horsie...} 9. Nd5 Qd8 {I think he jst took a chance, sometimes it can be a tactic to draw in a piece....so he had his reason.} 10. Bd2 {I have lost 10 games in a row...and whot i,ve learned is that i am way to eagar to attack before i'm developed...by opening the bottom rank, i can switch my rooks into the direction that i feel the game will swing, either queen or kingside, but because he havnt developed fully, i still dnt know wot he think, and he knows it.} Nce5 {lets go this side...i ddnt loose that pawn a d4 for nothing} 11. O-O-O {so, my rook pin, or will pin his pawn at d6 against his queen....} c6 {getting ridd of that night, with a reason, will empower my bishop at d2 } 12. Nf4 Nxc4 {i could have taken that night at c4 with my queen, but...obvious mooves make you loose a game....I can attack the block at e5} 13. e5 Ncxe5 14. Bc3 {there!!!....its jst a small moove that can swing a game....and out of its shadow...a great power will emerge...that bishop held the key!!} Be6 {so...that bishop tried to free that pin white had on the night at e5....so it will have to go...} 15. Nxe5 {attacking e5 with the piece that had the smallest reach to pentrate defences off oponent} Nxe5 16. Bxe5 {and....sending the good bishop in as a power moove!} Qc7 {white is now thinking two things....he must prevent black from casteling...it would be a great setback...and he must keep the attack fluent...and wot better means than to attack the black queen!} 17. Nxe6 fxe6 {so white is winning time...and persist in preventing black to castle!} 18. Bxd6 {the goodbishop had shown its strength up to now...standing its ground through a good tactical moove...it threaten the queen, also if the black bishop take it, white will release its queen and then the rook will attack d6!!} Qf7 19. Be5 {the good bishop open the file, preventing black to castle} Rg8 {Im not sure bout that moove...} 20. Rhe1 {that castle jst had to go there!} Rd8 21. Bd4 {again, i empower the goodbishop...} Qf4+ 22. Be3 Rxd1+ 23. Rxd1 Qxh2 {you take me....} 24. Bxa7 {i take you!} Qf4+ 25. Kb1 Kf7 {protecting that pawn!(keeping out the white queen!)} 26. Rd3 {now....look at how you take sumone out of a bunker:)} Kg6 {realising the pin, black moove the king...white have to prevent black to moove into Kh7....how will he do it?} 27. Rf3 {eazy, jst threaten the black queen like before:)} Qa4 {threatening bishop...} 28. Qd3+ {and that was the moove....its time for the black king to come and greet oponent!} Kg5 29. Be3+ {mooving the goodbishop back into the attack!} Kg4 30. Rg3+ {keeping the king on the run, and isolating it from defence..} Kh4 31. Rh3+ {something have to go} Kg4 32. f3# {and there it is! a nice game against a worthy opponent!  Believe me...he thrashed me the previous game:) so this was a game that would not easily be repeated:) thx maddie:))))}
