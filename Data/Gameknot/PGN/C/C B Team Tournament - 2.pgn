1. e4 e5 2. c4 {2.c4 must receive ? as it gives Black control of the d4 square. } Bc5 {a good move, focusing on both d4 and f2 (an historic weakness of 1e4 openings). } 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. a3 {White does not fall for Nxe4 Nxe4, d4 Bb5+; instead setting to trap the B via b4 & c5. } d6 {protects e5 & prevents a bishop trap. and permits the other B to have development opportunities. } 5. d3 a5 {stops b4. also provides a B haven on a7, and gives the Rook an opportunity (...Ra6 hmmm.)} 6. Be3 {covers the hole on d4. challenges the B. both good reasons. NOT afraid of ...Bxe3, fxe since this would support d4 and provide a rook half open file after O-O. } Nge7 7. h3 {I would prefer either Be2 or Nc3, both seeking to castle asap-ly. In this position I would not be afraid of ...Bg4. } f5 {interesting. almost forces Bxc5. though that would leave the d3 button open to serious pressure. } 8. exf5 {ouch. weaker than Bxc5. the next few moves leave White's king haven with serious holes. } Bxe3 9. fxe3 Nxf5 10. e4 {Ouch! Qd2 was a much better move. then ...Ng3, Rg1 Nxf1, Rxf1 permits White to survive for another day. the text move permits an invasion much more damaging. } Ne3 11. Qe2 {hmmm. Qc1 appears slightly better.} Nd4 12. Nxd4 exd4 13. h4 {to keep the Q off h4. } O-O 14. Kd2 Qf6 15. Nc3 Bg4 16. Qe1 dxc3+ 17. bxc3 Qh6 18. Qxe3 Rf2+ {good place to resign as it appears to be mate in 4. }
