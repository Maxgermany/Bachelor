1. e4 {My first rated challenge game with cyko. We played fast and loose in a previous unrated game.  A bit tighter here but still entertaining.} c5 {I rarely deviate from the Sicilian, which nearly always makes for an exciting game.} 2. c3 {This option is one of White's least exciting responses!  It is a good way of avoiding the most bookish lines, though, so very popular on Gameknot.} e6 {I've not been too successful recently with the most direct response, 2...d5, so I decided to adopt a more cautious approach.  This move helps develop my KB and prepares ...d5 as a more conservative move, while retaining the option of ...d6} 3. Nf3 d5 4. e5 {White by-passes the pawn, setting up a strong central pawn.} Nc6 {which I immediately attack, while developing the QN to its best square.  This move often provokes Bb5, when I like it if White swaps the B for the N, leaving me with the bishop pair.  I sometimes have trouble deciding how best to retake though.} 5. Bb5 {as predicted} Bd7 {relieving the pin and developing another piece.  In this position, compared with other Bb5 lines, White cannot crank up the attack on the pinned pieces with Ne5 because of his pawn on e5} 6. d4 {completing the pawn chain} a6 {asking the bishop the question} 7. Ba4 {as in the non-Exchange versions of the Spanish, White preserves his B by retreating it.  This loses a couple of tempi while Black completes his queenside development but the B retains its power for later.} b5 8. Bc2 Nge7 {With White's pawn on e5, Black can't develop his kingside completely normally.  ...Nf6 just loses the N; ...Nh6 allows White to swap on h6, giving him awkward doubled rook's pawns.  Developing the B first gives Black's N nowhere to develop.  Fianchettoing the B leaves weak dark squares everywhere on the kingside, while the B bites on granite.  So the plan is ....Nge7-g6 followed by ...Be7 and kingside castling, and continuing expansion on the queenside, though I have to be careful about White's Bs which control the diagonals b1-h7 and c1-h6 and a lightning strike by White's Q and Ns on my kingside.} 9. O-O Ng6 10. Be3 {attacking c5.  This is a good exception to the "rule" Ns before Bs".  By developing the B first, White seizes the initiative against Black's queenside and avoids hemming in his B with his N, which cannot develop to c3 because of White's pawn already there.  If Black takes on d4, then after the pawn retakes, his N can develop to c3 after all.} cxd4 11. cxd4 Be7 12. Re1 {While this is usually a good and useful move, it doesn't achieve much here.  Developing the N was preferable, I feel.} O-O 13. a3 Rc8 {Seizing the open file} 14. b4 {?! leaving c3 and c4 unprotected, though it does prevent Black's b-pawn from advancing and it does establish a strong point at c5, which White's N will need three moves to occupy.} a5 {attacking the  pawn straightaway and threatening to win it.} 15. bxa5 Nxa5 16. Bd2 Nc4 {Black occupies his strongpoint first, while White's QN is still at home} 17. Ra2 {and White's QR has to develop awkwardly to a2 rather than along the first rank} Qb6 {Black's queenside strategy is falling nicely into place.  White's QR and QN are tied to defending the isolated a-pawn and his potential kingside attack hasn't even started yet.} 18. Bg5 {White offers up his most active B for Black's most active B.  If Black takes, White's kingside attack can start with the N retaking on g5, releasing the Q for kingside action.  On the other hand, Black's B has no other useful moves and Black doesn't want to weaken his e-pawn to White's Re1 by playing ...f6, so} Bxg5 19. Nxg5 h6 {chasing off the intruder but weakening Black's defences, especially if White swaps B for N on g6} 20. Nf3 b4 {resuming the queenside attack immediately.  If White swaps pawns, Black threatens ... Nb2, attacking White's Q, followed by activating his B on the b-file as well} 21. Bb3 bxa3 22. Bxc4 {swapping B for the strong N but now Black gets another advanced passed pawn on the queenside, this time supported by a R} dxc4 23. Nxa3 {finally the QN develops by retaking the a-pawn but this allows Black's c-pawn to advance immediately} c3 24. g3 {giving his King some air to avoid back-rank mates in the queening episode to follow} Ne7 {prompted by White's last move: the N no longer has any potential on the kingside and is needed to support the pawn.  d5 looks a lovely square for this N.} 25. Qe2 {preparing to swing the R to b1 or c1 and double on the b-file or c-file.  Also, if the c-pawn does advance, it no longer gains a tempo by forcing the Q to move.  The Q also prepares White's next move.} Nd5 26. Nc4 {! :cutting off the R's support of the c-pawn, attacking Black's Q and threatening to jump to the outpost on d6, whence it would dominate Black's position: a truly multi-purpose move} Qb3 {if the N moves, ...c2 will follow} 27. Na5 {attacking the Q, thus delaying ...c2, but now} Qb5 {inviting the swap, which will eliminate the key to White's defence and leave White's N stuck on the rim} 28. Qxb5 Bxb5 29. Nb7 {threatenign to fork B and R from d6} Rc7 30. Nc5 {again cutting off the R's support of the pawn} Bc4 {but the pawn isn't dependent on the R, since the Nd5 defends it very nicely, so Black has time to manoeuvre his B up in support of the next advance} 31. Raa1 Rb8 {now the other R joins the attack} 32. Rec1 {White finally opposes the pawn with a Rook} Rb2 {but so does Black} 33. Ne1 {blockading c2} Kh7 {to avoid back-rank checks and potentially march up the board to attack d4} 34. Rc2 Rxc2 {swapping off an attacker for a defender seems an obvious move here.  If I had allowed White to take on b2, I didn't have any pieces ready to defend the pawn there, since the rook is prevented from moving to b7 by the Nc5} 35. Nxc2 Rc6 {preparing to occupy the b-file} 36. Na3 {attacking the B} Be2 {which stays on the f1-a6 diagonal, contesting several squares with White's Ns, but also threatening to block White's hole by going to f3} 37. Re1 {?! forcing Black to play the move planned anyway} Bf3 38. Nb5 {? attacking the pawn but also releasing it} c2 39. Rc1 Nb4 40. Nd7 {? revealing Black's Rook's defence of the c-pawn, thus allowing the Black N to attack the defending R: game over} Na2 41. Nf8+ {At this point, cyko acknowledged that he ws lost but we agreed to play on to the finish, so he launched his desperate defence with a "spite check"} Kg8 42. d5 {and a futile pawn lunge} Bxd5 43. Nd4 {forking R and pawn but White has an R and an N already en prise, so it's still hopeless} Nxc1 44. Nxc6 Ne2+ {the pawn queens} 45. Kf1 c1=Q+ 46. Kxe2 Bxc6 47. Kd3 Kxf8 {Black is in no hurry, so why not tidy up first before commencing final mating operations?} 48. f4 Bd5 49. f5 exf5 50. h4 Qc4+ {now the king hunt starts in earnest.  No doubt Freddy would have calcualted it all in advance and announced "Mate in 10" or whatever, but I decided to just work it out move by move as I played it.  I need my brain cells for something else!} 51. Ke3 Qe4+ 52. Kd2 Bc4 53. e6 Qd3+ 54. Kc1 Bb3 55. Kb2 Qc2+ 56. Ka3 Qc3 57. e7+ Kxe7 58. g4 Bc2+ 59. Ka2 Qb3+ 60. Ka1 Qb1# {so there you are! It was Mate in 10 after all!!}
