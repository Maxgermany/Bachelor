1. d4 {I don't like to use official names, variants and things like that. That's simply the opening I use most times.} d6 2. c3 Nf6 3. Nf3 {That's the most common situation I found myself in} g6 4. Na3 Bg7 5. g3 Be6 6. Bg2 Qd7 7. Ng5 d5 8. Qb3 {Starting the pawn's war} Qc6 9. Bf4 b6 10. Nb5 Na6 11. O-O {The attack on the pawn is failed, so let's try to mix the cards} O-O 12. a4 {Lets let my queen move without sacrificing my poor little horse} Nh5 13. Nxe6 {Sacrifice the horse. I'm still in doubt about this. I meant to force the black to column the pawns, or to make the queen move to finally win that pawn. But I opened the street for the tower, or let the queen have a straight road to my downtown.} fxe6 14. a5 {Another change of side, to let my tower advance and threat the horse} Nxf4 15. gxf4 {That's what I meant: enemy tower in my center} Rxf4 16. e3 {invaders must die!} Rg4 {I don't know if standing at the center has been a right choice, The threat is weak, and the tower now has less mobility.} 17. f3 {I was in doubt, if trying to ignore that big bad tower and continue the attack on the other side. But I don't like big bad towers. Even if that meant stopping my white bishop's threat to white's pawn-queen-tower} Rh4 18. h3 {preventing queen to advance in 2 moves protected by the tower} Qd7 19. axb6 {Let's try to unblock the situation} axb6 20. f4 c6 21. Na3 Rb8 22. Qd1 {Another change of side} Rf8 23. Qe1 Rh5 24. Qg3 Nc7 25. Bf3 Rhf5 26. h4 {At this point I didn't have a plan: threats to the tower were finished. All I wanted was to advance.} Kh8 {Here's the first of some moves I didn't catch. But for me it was "loss time" of my enemy, it was good.} 27. Bg4 Rf5f6 28. Nc2 {Freeing the tower to prevent some trick, and starting a long horse journey...} Rg8 29. Ne1 Ne8 30. Nf3 Nd6 31. Ne5 Qe8 32. Ra6 Ne4 33. Qg2 h5 34. Bh3 Nd6 {Another move I didn't catch. No threat, defensive position..} 35. Rxb6 {Finally recatched the pawn.} Nf5 36. Bxf5 gxf5 37. Kf2 {Preventing queen threat due to black bishop's movement+tower threat} Rh6 {Here I thought the bishop would steal my horse, making me lose time saving my queen to return back later. Luckily, that didn't happen.} 38. Qf3 {If the } Bxe5 {That happened now, but it's too late. My pieces are safe.} 39. fxe5 Qd7 40. Rg1 Rg4 41. Rxg4 hxg4 42. Qf4 Rh5 {I think I'd take the pawn. Maybe is not optimal, 'cause it left the queen go straight, but only a step that can be easily retaken, and does not make threat. Still pieces draw.} 43. Kg3 {Protect the pawn!} Qc7 44. Rb4 c5 45. dxc5 Qxc5 46. Rb8+ {Some diversive, maybe a little early} Kg7 47. Kf2 {I realized that e4 like I wanted to would mean checkmate for me. D'oh!} Qa7 48. Rb5 {Strategic retreat. From here on it's all a lot sequential.} Qa2 {I understand that move, but I think is a lot desperate. Position is not so strong, I'd rather protect the pawn in e7 with the king, instead, and left the queen in position.} 49. Qb4 {Another change of side, the last.} Kg6 50. Qxe7 Qc4 {Deasperate move #2. Maybe a threat to the queen with tower in h7 would slow down the attack for a while} 51. Qxe6+ Kg7 52. Rb7+ Kf8 53. Rf7+ {That could already be the end...but I realize it only now :S} Kg8 54. Qg6+ Kh8 55. Qxh5+ Kg8 56. Qg6+ Kh8 57. Rh7# {}
