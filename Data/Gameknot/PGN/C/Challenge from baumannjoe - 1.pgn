[Black "baumannjoe (1378)"]
[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {I open with a Classical move.} e6 {Joe's response is cautious but solid.} 2. e4 {The natural move, forming an "ideal center".} c5 {Joe wastes no time challenging said center.} 3. Nf3 {I develop and defend.} Nc6 {Joe counters by developing his own Knight.} 4. d5 {Rather than exchange, I push the Pawn.} exd5 {Joe opts to trade...} 5. exd5 {...and I complete the central exchange.} Nce7 {5... N-N5 was the more aggressive alternative, but I could then have chosen to play 6 P-QR3, forcing the Knight's retreat.} 6. d6 {I jab at the Knight...} Nc6 {...which returns to its natural square.} 7. Qe2+ {Black has to interpose, as the King lacks a flight square. } Nge7 {7... B-K2 would force my hand, as the King would then have a flight square and Black could break the pin at any time. As things stand, I don't have to play PxN just yet.} 8. Nc3 {I choose to develop my other Knight.} g6 {I assume Joe intends to fianchetto his B.} 9. Nd5 {Not only does this add further pressure to the pinned Knight, it also contains a hidden threat.} h6 {If Joe had gone ahead and fianchettoed his B...} 10. Nf6# {...I would be unable to do this. [He's doing much better in our second game.]}
