[Opening "KGA (C34), Bonsch-Osmolovsky variation"]

1. e4 {Still the most popular opening move.} e5 {Probably the best reply even now.} 2. f4 {A gambit is offered.} exf4 {An honorable gentleman must accept!} 3. Nf3 {The best play, forever neutralizing the threat of ...Q-R5 ch.} Ne7 {An unusual, and somewhat conservative, variant.} 4. d4 {Seizing command of the center, as is always White's objective in this opening.} g5 {Adding support to the advanced KBP, but because of Black's 3rd move, the supporting Pawn itself is now vulnerable.} 5. Nxg5 {White equalizes the material and aims his Knight at the weakened Black K-side.} Ng6 {Repositioning, with a discovered attack as well.} 6. h4 {Rather than retreat, White adds support to the Knight.} Bg7 {Completing the fianchetto, attacking White's central Pawns, and preparing to castle.} 7. Bc4 {Aiming at the usual target: the weak point at Black's KB2.} O-O {Tucking the King in what Black thinks is the safest available spot, while adding a guard to the KBP.} 8. Qh5 {Threatening 9 QxP mate!} h6 {The alternative is 8... R-K1, which allows 9 BxP ch winning the Exchange. However, this move allows a quick checkmate!} 9. Qxg6 {Threatens 10 Q-R7 mate. If Black creates a flight square with 9... R-K1, 10 BxP ch gives Black the choice of 10... K-R1 11 Q-R7 mate or 10 K-B1 11 N-R7 ch with mate or overwhelming material gain for White to follow shortly.} hxg5 {Seemingly the only choice. } 10. hxg5 {Renewing the mate threat on KR7. Black resigns [10... R-K1 11 QxP mate.]}
