1. b3 {Larsen's Opening! White seeks to fianchetto his QB and use it to pressure Black's center and Kingside. } e5 {Black occupies the center immediately. } 2. Bb2 d6 {White attacks the pawn; Black defends it. Somewhat more common is 2...Nc6. } 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Nc6 {White fianchettoes his *other* Bishop, while Black develops both Knights. This is a typical hypermodern setup, with Black occupying the center directly and White attacking it from the wings. } 5. c4 {Giving more power to the Bg2, by controlling d5 and giving space for a White Knight on c3. } g6 6. e3 {Black prepares to fianchetto his own KB. White, meanwhile, intends to play Ne2 and d2-d4, but he must be careful: his pawn moves have left many potential weaknesses. } Bh6 {This awkward-looking move actually puts pressure on e3 and makes d2-d4 more dangerous for White, as the e3 pawn may become quite vulnerable and Black may even look for a sacrifice there. } 7. Ne2 O-O 8. Qc2 {? White would have been better off castling immediately. At the time, I wanted to prevent an e5-e4 intrusion, but the WQ will prove too easily harassed on c2. } Nb4 {8...Bf5 works as well. } 9. Qc3 {Threatening the Knight and optimistically lining up with the Bishop against the Black kingside. } a5 {Black defends his Knight rather than retreat it--looking for possibilities on c2 or d3, no doubt. } 10. d4 {? Once again, White should have simply castled. This move further weakens e4. } Bf5 {Threatening ...Nc2+, of course. There was actually a subtler, nastier move here: 10...Bh3! This effectively trades off White's Bishop after 11.O-O Bxg2 12.Kxg2, leaving the light squares around the White King dangerously weak. The point is that White must not take: 11.Bxh3?? Ne4! and the White Queen is a goner (e.g. 12.Qc1 Nd3+). } 11. Na3 {? White defends c2 but overlooks d3, and must pay the price. Yet again, the correct choice was 11.O-O. Castle early; castle often! } Nd3+ 12. Kd2 {?? Too overly aggressive, this move allows 12...Nxf2 and the threat of 13...Ne4+. The result is a horrid incursion into the White position and an absolutely lost game after 12...Nxf2 13.Ke1 (avoiding the fork) Nd3+ 14.Kf1 Ne4! Best was 12.Kf1. } Ne4+ {? Too early; 12...Nxf2 was called for instead. Black is still better, but now White can diffuse the attack somewhat. } 13. Bxe4 Bxe4 14. Rhf1 {White gets his Rook out of danger, defends f2, and prepares f2-f3. All the while, the weak e3 pawn is pinned to the White King, and White's only threat--the idea of a strike down the a1-h8 diagonal--can be put to the sword any time Black sees fit, as the White Bishop cannot escape from the Nd3. } c5 {Here I probably would have played 14...Nxb2, but the text is actually reasonably strong, although it gives Black weaknesses at b5 and b6. The point is that since the pawn on e3 is pinned, Black can force his way through on d4. If White takes on e5 or c5, the d-file opens up, with the Black Queen glaring down at the helpless White King. } 15. d5 {Every line I saw seemed to end up with my two Knights against Black's two Bishops, so this move seemed natural. Knights are stronger than Bishops in closed positions, and besides, there was no way I was going to let Black open the d-file against my King. This move also establishes strongpoints on c6 and e6, and blockades the Black d-pawn: my Knights should have a field day. } Rb8 {? This is not a tactical misstep, but rather a problem of timing: this move doesn't present any threats or eliminate any of White's options, so White has enough tempo to finally kick his counterplay into gear. } 16. f3 {Further weakening e3, but kicking back the pesky Bishop and ensuring that Black will have to give up *some* part of his attack. } f5 {?! This sacrifice is overly-aggressive, and not altogether sound, but the resulting position is very fun. The idea is to provide constant defense for the Nd3, which is a huge thorn in White's side, while potentially opening lines for the heavy Black pieces. The downside is that it badly weakens e6 and f6. } 17. Nf4 {?! After the fact, I think 17.fxe4 was probably stronger, but this line is much more exciting. No matter what Black chooses, it seems to me that White comes out at least a pawn or two stronger. This is basically due to the fact that Black has two pieces trapped--his LSB and Knight. They will certainly be cleared off soon enough, whereas White will only lose his Knight and a pawn or two. Black obviously has many options here, but I think the most promising are 17...Nxf4 18.exf4 Bxf3, where the Bishop can get back to defend g7. It seems Black *must* take the Knight, since it's threatening to leap to e6. Taking with the e-pawn is tempting, but it opens up the long diagonal... } exf4 {? Black accepts the 'sacrifice', but at the price of opening his kingdom to the invading armies. His LSB is still hanging as well, of course. This is the trap I was hoping for when I played move 17: I hadn't looked very far down all the lines, but it seems very promising for White (in fact, I believe it's just winning outright). } 18. Qh8+ {The White Queen and Bishop battery, sitting patiently in the corner since move nine, finally gets a chance to shine, and they will not disappoint! } Kf7 19. Qxh7+ {One pawn down, and the Bishop is White's for the taking. Of course, now White has a hanging Bishop as well. } Ke8 {Forced. } 20. Qxg6+ {This seems natural. White clears some timber while trying to get everything organized for this impromptu assault. I felt if I could chase the BK towards the queenside, perhaps I could get some use out of my misplaced Knight. The WQ  is also still indirectly guarding b2: after Qxh6 Nxb2, White has enough checking options to eventually place a check on f6, g7, or h8, allowing her to swoop back and gobble up that Knight, and then eventually that Be4. } Ke7 {?? Tragically, we never get to see how this one would have played out; Black blunders into a mate instead. 20...Kd7 was necessary. } 21. Qe6# {That's all there is! Obviously the competitors here were mis-matched, but Black played very well and I thought there was enough material to make for some interesting study. Thanks for reading! }
