1. c4 e5 2. d4 {I know my friend... he would try something off-beat like this.} exd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6 4. Qe4+ {This is definitely tricky to deal with if you've never seen it before... and I'm sure most people haven't. Also, again we're talking maybe a 1300 or 1400 rated player on both sides of the board.} Nge7 {I have no idea if this is the best move or not. Maybe one of you 1600+ players can answer that.} 5. e3 b6 6. b3 Bb7 7. Bb2 {Trapping Black's KB, as ...P-N3 would now allow BxR.} Qc8 8. Na3 d6 9. O-O-O a5 {This allows White to seize an outpost for the QN.} 10. Nb5 Rb8 11. Be2 Qd7 12. Nf3 Ba8 13. Nh4 h6 {Black is obviously running low on ideas.} 14. h3 Bb7 15. Bg4 Qd8 16. Nf5 Rg8 {Black's cramped position is going to be his doom if he does not expand.} 17. Nbd4 Ba8 18. Nxe7 Bxe7 {The recapture with the Knight was probably better.} 19. Nf5 Rf8 {Why??? Well, at this level of chess, blunders decide games.} 20. Nxg7# {Black didn't see this nice discovered mate!}
