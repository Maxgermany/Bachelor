[Opening "Sicilian (B40), Anderssen variation"]

1. e4 {1. e4 very common, allows for an exciting attacking match, compared to 1. d4.} c5 {Start of the Sicilian an opening which i have became accustomed to playing against and playing with. If played properly can cause your opponent real problems. white must play carefully as this is a very useful counter attacking opening compared to others.} 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 {I find this the best way to respond when in this position.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 {Common opening here. I have played from this position many times as white.} Bc5 {Easily dealt with and whites response asks black the question of the exchange after black either protects bishop after Nb3, or moves bishop to safety.} 5. Nb3 Bb6 {This now gives white an "extra move" which is used for development of whites pieces.} 6. Nc3 Qf6 {Trying for mate on f2! Disappointed with this move, the queen has been moved out to early and now is a target for white to attack/develop pieces.} 7. f4 {This opens the diagonal for the queen prevents Qf2 and now hopefully can be used to open up the DSB's diagonal.} e5 {I think this move is a major factor why black lost the match. It allows the knight into a very good position (d5) which will cause problems for black and can not be moved easily as there are no pawns which are able to threaten it.} 8. Nd5 {Into good position forking queen and bishop. Again forcing black to make a move of a "developed piece"} Qd8 {To look at the board here my position is far superior and now have a game only I can lose. Black is underdeveloped and all whites lines are open with the exception of DSB however after fxe5 that will be available. White has had tempi from very early and now dictates the game. } 9. Qg4 {Brings the queen into game on a very strong position and threatens blacks rook.} g6 {dealing with the threat on the rook.} 10. fxe5 {although the threat on the rook has been diverted white now opens the DSB's diagonal and now white is fully developed in an attacking sense. Defence of the king is easily taking care of if Ba5 is played with c3. Pressure is relieved from black if white plays Nxa5 as Queen can then escape from its position where it is now trapped.} h5 {Now white has all diagonals open for bishops the knights are situated for defensive/attacking duties ideally and once queen is moved to g3, to protect e5 pawn which is major in whites attack as this prevents black from alot of options and helps keep blacks queen trapped. white is strolling. Note: Qf4 closes bishops diagonal.} 11. Qg3 {White now can wait to exploit blacks limited moves. 11. ..,h4 12. Qg4 not as strong a position for queen but still is enough to over run black.} Ne7 {The reason for opening up the bishops diagonals as quickly as possible against the under developed black.} 12. Bg5 Nbc6 13. Bb5 {Black is totally lost and has been for some time. white now waits the next move. there are so many options for white to play from any move black can think up! Black should resign.} f6 14. exf6 {continued advancement of the pawn. black can not move knight as this results in the loss of blacks queen after f7 .} Kf7 {Gives the possability of the first mating opportunity.} 15. Bc4 {Nxd5, Bxd5 , kf7, Qd6 , Ke8, f7# or Nxd5, Bxd5  Kf8, Qd6 , Ne7, fxe7 , Ke8, Qxg6#  other variations of these lines result in mates i believe.} d6 {prevents the mate but now causes black other problems in the form of losing the queen.} 16. fxe7 {threatening queen. Must take pawn with knight as moving queen to any possible position results in losing her next move.} Nxe7 17. Nxb6+ Be6 {best move by black does not help any though as whites position is superior and has over ran black.} 18. Rf1+ Ke8 {this now seals the queens fate. although Kg7 doesn't help much either :) } 19. Bb5+ Bd7 20. Bxd7+ Qxd7 21. Nxd7 Kxd7 {All forced from Ke8, white still has position and material.} 22. O-O-O {getting king into a position it cannot be harrassed and putting pressure on d6.} Nc8 23. Rxd6+ {Looks extreme but it ensures a quick mate. I believe no matter what black does white will get mate from this position quickly :) Correct me if am wrong} Nxd6 24. Rd1 Ke8 25. Qxd6 {obvious mate threat.} Rh7 26. Rf1 {mate threat with Rf8#.} Rf7 27. Rxf7 Kxf7 28. Qe7+ Kg8 29. Bh6 Re8 30. Qg7# {White wins!  This is a game i am very proud of as although black does make some questionably moves i keep initiative throughout and force black to throw away position and material.  If anything has to be taken from this game then it should be to attack queens that have been introduced to the game early with development and the obvious; well developed opponent should always beat under developed opponent.  Hope you enjoyed the game,  David.}
