1. Nf3 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bf5 {This is a solid choice by Black against the Zukertort.} 4. a3 a6 5. b3 e6 6. Bb2 Nf6 7. Be2 Bd6 8. Nbd2 O-O 9. O-O Ne7 {Presumably done to allow c5.} 10. c4 {White gets in the first pawn break.} c6 11. c5 Bc7 12. b4 b6 13. cxb6 Bxb6 14. Rc1 {Now Black is saddled with a backward pawn on an open file.} Bc7 15. Nb3 Ng4 16. h3 Nf6 17. Nc5 {This is a nice outpost for the N.} Qc8 18. Ne5 h6 19. Qa4 Bxe5 20. dxe5 Ne4 21. Nxe4 Bxe4 22. Bd4 {Black's c pawn is still weak, but White now has a pawn weakness as well.} Qc7 23. Rc5 Qc8 24. Rfc1 Qb7 25. Ra5 {a6 now has three attackers and only two defenders.} Rac8 {This mistake allows the win of the pawn plus the exchange.} 26. Bxa6 Qc7 27. Bxc8 Nxc8 28. Qxc6 {White picks up another pawn.} Qe7 {Black gambles on a Kingside attack again White's weak g pawn.} 29. f3 Bf5 30. e4 Bxh3 {This sacrifice opens up White's K, but Black no longer has enough firepower to do damage.} 31. gxh3 Qg5+ 32. Kf1 Ne7 33. Qc2 Ng6 34. Rc5 Nf4 35. Rc3 Nxh3 36. Qg2 {This will ultimately force the exchange of Qs, which means that White's material advantage will weigh more heavily.} Qh5 37. Qg4 Qxg4 38. fxg4 Ng5 39. exd5 exd5 40. Rc3c8 Ne6 {This threatens the R, but White does not have to respond immediately because of the check in his back pocket.} 41. Rxf8+ Nxf8 42. Rc8 {Now that the N is pinned, Black will lose more material.  White has an extra R and two mobile passed pawns, so Black resigned here.}
