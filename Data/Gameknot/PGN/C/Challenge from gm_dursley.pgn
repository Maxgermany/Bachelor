1. e4 e6 {Thinking about switching from the french after recent results with it!} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {Mostly because all of the black lines for the winawer are very unpleasant..} Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7 7. Qg4 {The main line, and best line for white IMO} O-O {Probably a mistake, I now play the more main line: Qc7} 8. Bd3 {Straight to the point ;)} Qa5 {Looking back I'm pretty much walking into a disaster here.. marching my queen off to the queenside and leaving my kingside.} 9. Bd2 Nbc6 10. Nf3 f5 {Otherwise 11 Bxh7  Is a killer I think..} 11. exf6 e.p. Rxf6 {Bxh7  is now no longer too great, and I've got a little bit of space on the kingside} 12. Qh5 Nf5 {g6 weakens my kingside too much for my liking} 13. g4 c4 {Had this planned and couln't see anything wrong with it} 14. gxf5 cxd3 {Now I expected to either Take of f5 or c2 and be fine.} 15. Rg1 {Strange..} dxc2 {Munch..} 16. Qe8+ {What's he doing? I play Rf8 and the queen has to go back where it came from} Rf8 17. Rxg7+ {I'm starting to get a bit worried here when my opponent tells me theres mate coming..} Kxg7 18. Bh6+ {Round about now I'm starting to believe him} Kxh6 19. Qxf8+ Kh5 {Now I've seen it myself. Pretty amazing, mate in 11 right from where he took on g7. so if you think about it. I'm lost as soon as he plays g4.} 20. Qf7+ Kg4 21. h3+ Kxf3 22. fxe6+ Ke4 23. Kd2 c1=Q+ 24. Rxc1 Nxd4 25. Re1+ Ne2 26. Rxe2# {Completing a pretty beautiful trap.}
