1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 O-O 8. d5 {I seldom see this move from over the board against club players.} Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 Nxe4 {My purpose in capturing this pawn is to make my opponent think thus getting the edge over time.} 10. O-O Nxc3 11. Qd3 Nxd5 12. Bxd5 {White is a piece up but three pawns down and I think it will be a hard struggle in the endgame when the heavy pieces are out of the board!} d6 13. Ng5 g6 14. f4 Kg7 15. Bb2+ f6 16. f5 Ne5 17. Bxe5 dxe5 18. Ne6+ Bxe6 {Exchanges makes the end a simpler affair!} 19. fxe6 c6 20. Bc4 Qxd3 21. Bxd3 Rfe8 22. Bc4 b5 23. Bb3 a5 24. a4 Re7 25. Rac1 bxa4 26. Bxa4 Rxe6 27. Rxc6 Rxc6 28. Bxc6 Ra7 29. Rb1 a4 30. Rb7+ Rxb7 31. Bxb7 {Now it's time to bring the King into action!} f5 32. Bd5 Kf6 33. Kf2 e4 34. Ke3 Ke5 35. Bg8 {This seems an unnecessary move but considering the time White has, there is nothing to argue about.} h6 36. g3 g5 {f4 can never be prevented} 37. Ba2 a3 38. h3 f4+ 39. gxf4+ gxf4+ 40. Ke2 Kd4 41. Kd2 f3 42. Bf7 e3+ 43. Ke1 Kc3 {After this move my opponent's time expires while I still have 1m24s left on my clock. White is lost anyway. He cannot stop the queening pawns once and for all. Really a memorable game from a very strong opponent! Played over the internet last July 20, 2013.}
