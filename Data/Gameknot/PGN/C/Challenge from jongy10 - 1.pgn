1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bd6 {Already Dad is trying something new.} 3. Nc3 {I'm just thinking "knights before bishops"} Nf6 4. Bc4 h6 5. a3 a6 6. b4 b5 7. Bb3 Bb7 8. Bb2 O-O {Even though I have 2 bishops beaming down to his king side, he still castles on that side.} 9. d3 c5 10. h3 cxb4 11. axb4 {He can play Bxb4 and pin my knight. I'll likely play Nxe5 and then O-O to remove the pin.} Qc7 12. O-O {Preventing the pin. I'm hoping I can get some action on the d5 square that kills his king side knight. Then my king side knight and queen can launch an attack.} Bxb4 13. Nd5 Bxd5 14. Bxd5 Nc6 15. Bxc6 dxc6 16. Bxe5 {That cleared the board!} Qe7 17. Bd4 Bd6 {Oh dear... set himself for a fork here.} 18. e5 Bxe5 19. Nxe5 Rfc8 20. Bb2 g6 21. Qf3 {Once I move my knight, his knight will be under attack from both my queen and bishop.} h5 22. Rfe1 {Now, when I move my knight his queen will be under attack - it will be difficult for him to save both the queen and the knight.} Qb4 {This feels like a blunder, for giving away the knight. Perhaps he felt that exchanging his knight for my bishop was a good deal, except that my queen+knight will be threatening checkmate.} 23. Qxf6 Rcf8 24. Nc4 {Only way he can prevent Qg7# is to sacrifice his queen.  Time for him to resign.}
