1. d4 {I am annotating this for two friends from Oswestry, who were playing each other on Gameknot.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {So it starts very conventionally. Now d7-d5 would lead to the Orthodox Line of the Queen's Gambit Declined.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit_Declined Or Bf8-b4 is the Nimzo-Indian Defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian_Defence} c5 {This is quite playable too. Now 4. d4-d5 leads to Benoni systems.} 4. Nf3 {But white doesn't go for that.} cxd4 {And Black prevents the pawn advance.} 5. Qxd4 {I personally think this is the wrong way to recapture, as it allows black to develop the Nb8 with an attack on the white queen, gaining time.} Nc6 {Like this. I think this looks a bit like an English opening now.} 6. Qd1 {The queen returns to base, but Qf4 or Qh4 could well have been considered too.} d5 {Black advances in the centre, gaining space.} 7. cxd5 {White takes.} exd5 {Black takes back.} 8. Bg5 {This is a mistake. White has to prevent further advance of the d pawn with e3.} d4 {This gives black an advantage.} 9. Bxf6 {White reduces the black fire-power.} Qxf6 {The correct way to recapture, as to not compromise the king side pawns.} 10. Ne4 {10. Nb5 was played instead in paulatica (1537) vs. fromluxembourg (1915), but white also lost. I don't think 10. Nb5 is an improvement.} Bb4+ {Black correctly develops with tempo} 11. Nfd2 {White blocks.} Qe5 {Threatening the knight as the other knight is pinned.} 12. a3 {White hits the Bishop.} Bxd2+ {So black exchanges.} 13. Nxd2 {White has to take this way, or he loses the knight on e4.} O-O {Black correctly continues to develop.} 14. g3 {White prepares to fianchetto the white squared bishop.} d3 {Another good attacking move, which gives white problems...} 15. b4 {Which white doesn't meet in the best way. 15. e3 was better threatening to take the pawn on d3 with his bishop.} Nd4 {Black moves his knight into an attacking square.} 16. e3 {But now this is too late. Rc1 was needed to save his queen.} Nc2+ {It is all over now.} 17. Qxc2 {The queen is going to go.} dxc2 {And it is gone.} 18. Rc1 {White could have probably spared us these last moves.} Qb2 {Another great attacking move, winning move material.} 19. Rxc2 {So white takes.} Qxc2 {Black takes back.} 20. Bg2 {White tries to develop.} Rd8 {Now if the knight moves, Rd8 is mate. Faced with yet more material loss, white wisely resigned. I thought this is extremely well played by black!
