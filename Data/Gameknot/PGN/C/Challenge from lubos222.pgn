1. d4 Nf6 {Playing the benoni for the first time on GK in a rated game. } 2. c4 c5 3. e3 {White usually play d5 but this variation seems ok to me.} e6 {The GK database gives g6 but the order has little importance, I think.} 4. g3 g6 {Preparing the fiancheto which is part of the benoni} 5. Bg2 {White opts for a fiancheto as well} d5 {I'm not sure about this move. I expected white to play d5 and may be I should have plaid 5. ... Bg2} 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Nc3 Be6 {Now I have to defend the poor d pawn who should, in the variation I plaid till now be on d3} 8. Qb3 b6 9. Nge2 c4 10. Qa4+ Qd7 11. Qxd7+ {This move permits black to bring the b knight out but it would probably have been in a better square on c6.} Nbxd7 12. Nb5 {Menaces from a fork attack by 13. Nc2} Bb4+ 13. Bd2 Bxd2+ 14. Kxd2 {The white king cannot castle anylonger.} O-O {But black does castle} 15. h3 {The situation seems equilibrated. Material is equal, no direct theats, uncertain fight for the center, both pawn structures are ok, nobody occupates the semi open files, white king relatively unsafe} a6 {I don't want this knight on my territory.} 16. Nbc3 Rfe8 {Now, the open e file, important in the benoni} 17. g4 {The advantage of having the king on the center files is that one doesn't hesitate to move the wing pawns.} b5 {To enable Nb3} 18. a3 Nb6 {To enable the LSB to go to d7} 19. Rhb1 Bd7 20. b3 {ennoying attack} Ne4+ 21. Nxe4 {Trade} dxe4 {White has now an advantage with the pawn structure} 22. Nc3 {To attack the pawn e4} Bc6 {Protecting e4} 23. Bf1 cxb3 {To prevent bxc4} 24. Rxb3 Nd5 25. Bg2 Nxc3 {another trade} 26. Rxc3 Bd5 {Blocking the center} 27. Rac1 {Dangerous situation with the double rooks} Re6 {to prevent Rc6} 28. Rc3c7 Rf6 29. Ke1 Rd8 {to prevent d7. I begin to have a plan using the pawn superiority on the right wing but the white rooks must be in a proper position} 30. Re7 Re6 {I was afraid that white would have trade the rooks} 31. Rec7 {White doesn't want to trade} Kg7 {For my plan I might have to send the d rook on another line and have the king in peace} 32. h4 a5 {Go for the pawn attack} 33. Rc1c5 b4 34. axb4 axb4 35. Rb5 b3 36. Kd2 Ra6 37. Bxe4 Ra2+ 38. Kc3 Rc2+ {Mistake ! I was to greedy, looking for the mate instead of simply taking the LSB with my bishop. I had a wining position, menacing f2 with my rook... The winning sequence for black was : 38. ... Bxe4 39. Rxb3 Rxf2 (protecting f7)} 39. Bxc2 {The game is lost.} bxc2 40. Kxc2 Be4+ 41. Kc3 Bf3 42. g5 Ra8 43. Re7 Ra3+ 44. Rb3 Ra2 45. Rb2 Ra1 46. e4 Rh1 47. Rbb7 Kf8 48. Rexf7+ Ke8 49. Rxf3 {}
