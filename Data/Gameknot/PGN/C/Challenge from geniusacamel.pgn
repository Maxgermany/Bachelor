1. e4 {So, I'll open up with the most typical move.} e5 {This time, instead of French, he'll do something different which I'm very used to. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Yes, the anticipated Ruy Lopez.} a6 {Of course.  A move that you typically see from masters and grandmasters, as Jack told me.} 4. Bxc6 {So, I take.  While not so bad, as it's toward the center, my idea is to still double his pawns.  Since he cannot take back with his Q, I did not see how this would strengthen his structure.  Plus, as this is a similar instince, that happened in my game against Jack, that if I played 4.Ba4, once 4...b5, I'd lose my B since it would be locked with my pawns.  However, the oversight and paradox is that 5.Bb3 would be an option.  The difference with Jack is that the N was pinned, and a pawn was already on the fifth rank.  So, when he attacked it, I played a similar move.  Not sure, but let's suppose it was, like this so, Ba4, then he played ...b5, so since the pawn was on a5, once I played ...Bb3, he was able to win a piece for a pawn after the immediate a4.  So, that where I miscalculated by mixing concepts which is something you don't want to do.  Instead, the best move, here, was 4.Ba4 as it's conventional since most master and GM's play that.} dxc6 {Conventional.} 5. O-O {So, I waste no time in deciding to castle.  The idea castle early and often and get that K to safety.} Bg4 {To pin my N.  But, of course I won't do anything about that, right away, because it is a nuisance and nothing serious.} 6. Nc3 {So, instead, I'll use that time to continue with development.} Qf6 {I knew there was a plan behind this, but wasn't sure how he'd do that by bringing the Q out before completing development before, but there is a well known orchestrated because what follows is something similar to what Jack did, and afterward, he had a slight advantage, already.} 7. d3 {The DSB needs to come out, one way or another to complete development.  But, I decided on this move, rather then, a fianchetto because this is a center pawn needed to control the center.  If I fianchettoed, it would be a wasted move, when the time needs to be used to contest the center, which is the decision behind this.  Plus, I don't lose anything and am not forced to waste time since my LSB is no longer around.} Ne7 {While that DSB is crammed still a good way to develop, and white still have some really good idea.} 8. Bg5 {? Mistake as the computer shows, and that's because this move loses a pawn, no matter what I do.  What the computer, for the next few moves is exactly what gets played.  With that, the computer says that best was 8.Qe2, with the idea of 8...0-0-0 9.Be3, Bxf3 10.Qxf3, Qxf3 11.gxf3, Ng6 12.Kh1, Be7 13.Rg1, Rd7 14.a4, Rhd8 15.a5, h5 16.Rad1  I agree.  } Bxf3 9. Bxf6 {There was another option that I looked at, which wouldn't lose material.  That is, 9.Qxf3??, but the problem then is that he has 9...Qxf3, and after 10.gxf3, my K is exposed, which I was not going to allow, so this was the best move.  In fact, this Q exchange very similar to what happened in a game against Jack, where we exchanged with other pieces, but when he did this, like wise, he also had a slight advantage, and it was due to a miscalculation. } Bxd1 10. Bxe7 {The only other move that came to mind was 10.Rxd1?? to prevent losing the pawn, or so I thought.  But, I looked at it and realized that this is bad because I wind up a piece down, after 10...gxf6 which I was not going to do.} Bxc2 11. Bxf8 {The analysis, here, is completely wrong as they say that with my previous, 11.Rae1 would be indirectly.  That's not true, and that move would be a blunder, as I'd be more then a piece down.  This was best to prevent that.} Rxf8 {Of course.  But, now, I looked at how the pawn could be defended, and there is no way to do that, which means that I lose another.} 12. Rae1 {?! The idea is to attack the center because, as I learned in the Deeper Chess Theory Club, attacking the center is a way to control the center.  This, however, is an inaccuracy because it loses another pawn.  Instead, better was 12.f4 and then pawns are exchanged, instead.  After that comes, 12...exf4 13.d4, 0-0-0 14.Rxf4, Rxd4 15.Raf1, Rd7 16.e5, Bg6 17.e6, Re7 18.exf7, Rfxf7 19.Rxf7, Bxf7 20.Rd1, Rd7 21.Re1} Bxd3 13. Ne2 O-O-O 14. f3 {Now, the computer says that the continuation is 14.f4, but I disagree with it.  First, that that allows black to liquidate with 14...exf4, when down material.  Plus, this achieves a solid pawn chain.  Remember when I disagreed over pawn structures and said what I would've, well this is the kind of thing I was alluding to.  Here, it's no blunder because it also improves the mobility of my f R, which has the pressure of his LSB, due to this half pin against my N.} Bb5 {However, I do not know why he played this.} 15. Rf2 {But, this was also my plan behind 14.f3, is that the R is now mobile, and my N is no longer half pin so that I'm now free to move it, without the loss of material which was the idea. } Rd2 {He is deciding to apply the pressure.  } 16. Nc3 {But, I have ways around it, especially given that the N is not pinned, as noted above.} Rfd8 {Doubling up and putting pressure.  And, now I've got no idea what to do, in this position.} 17. Rxd2 {Generally speaking, I don't like liquidation, when down material, even if less then a piece.  But, here there was no choice because of that LSB, so if I didn't take, while not right away, he would've won more material, which, I was not going to allow.} Rxd2 {So, now it boils down to what to do next.} 18. b3 {Ok, the idea here was the same, for the most part, pawn chains.  But, unlike before, it's not a good use of that.  Instead, best was 18.Nd1 keeping the pawn protecting, whilst, putting pressure on the R.  } Rc2 {So, now I'm forced to exchange pieces, which is the last thing I wanted.  Anything else would lose the a pawn.  } 19. Nxb5 {With that being said, my original instinct was to play 19.a4, but then, he plays captures the pawn, and when I take back, he gets my R.  So, this is best. } cxb5 {Of course.} 20. a3 {The idea was to prevent the loss of another pawn.  But, he still wins it, with the next move, and with it, 20.Ra1 was best.} Ra2 {Yes, and like I said, he gets another pawn, no matter what I do.} 21. a4 {Not knowing what to do, I go after the pawn.  Of course, I still don't like exchanging, but that's only with pieces.  With pawns, however, I don't have a problem doing so, especially when it strengthens my position, a little, after what I lost.} bxa4 {Of course.} 22. bxa4 {But, I'm not going to go easy.} Rxa4 {As I calculated there.} 23. Rc1 {Ok, since I'm down material, I try to come up with a plan to win back a pawn.  It's good that I'm thinking ahead, but the plan is quite bad, as we're about to see.  The idea is to maneuver that R, get it on the seventh rank, and nab a pawn there.} Ra2 {To put pressure on the first rank, and the plan there is to get a passed pawn and promote.} 24. Rc5 {? The idea is win a pawn, but as the computer says, this is a mistake.  And, that's because it gives black a passed pawn after 24...b5!!  Instead, best was 24.f4, exf4 25.Rf1, Kd7 26.Rxf4, Ke6 27.Rf3, h6 28.Rg3, g6 29.Rh3, Re2 30.Rxh6, Rxe4 31.Rh7, Rd4 32.Kf2, Rd2+ 33.Kf3} b5 25. Rxe5 {?? As part of the plan.  Now, for a while I've been debating, when, "To take is a mistake"  This happened in my game easy19, where I took the R, and overlooked a mate threat.  But, in my game against archduke_piccolo and could and ought to have taken his R, though, not right away.  So, I figured this was a similar situation, especially since I didn't see any immediate mate threats.  But, there was most, certainly, a threat that I overlooked.  And, taking was a terrible idea, this time as it loses very quickly.  That pawn will promote, and black will do damage.  And, in fact, the promotions will happen earlier.  So, as noted, based on what the computer, best was 25.Rd5.  And, actually I disagree with the computer about 25.Rd5, as best because the result would be the same with black's next move.  Instead, that R had to remain on c5.} b4 {And, this pawn is going to promote, and when it does, I'm in big trouble.  Acutally, similar to what happened in my game against angellis, as I won the R, the same way, with a promotion, but this time, unlike with Jack, with no miscalculation.} 26. Rc5 {But, I'm not quite ready to use my K as a weapon, so this what I decide to play.  The idea is that I'm going right after the P, though, with the last, move it's too little, too late to stop from the promotion.  If the R hadn't move, I could've prevented that from occurring, which is why taking was a big mistake.} b3 {Still making it's way.} 27. Rc3 {To temporarly delay it, seeing what I could do to stop it.} b2 {But, there's no way around it.} 28. Rb3 {Still doing what I can, however.  I actually wanted to play and was thinking about 28.Rc2, but black would immediately mate, after 28...b1=Q#  Worth noting is the fact, that in the past, I've missed that mate.  But, that's where I remember easy19's advice to, "Be a spectator of your game, which I emphasize to my students.  In one respect, using as a teaching tool, with a move which overlooked mate, and I delivered it, teaching that same thing.  So, another way to say that I used what Fred said, to teach others, in my first loss against him.} Ra1+ {Guaranteeing the promotion, because if black did so immediately with 28...b1=Q+, this time, he would lose a pawn, after 29.Rxb1.  But, this prevents that.  And, as we know, and like I calculated, black is not going to underestimate because he knows what my R can really do, if he doesn't do something, right away, as he did here.} 29. Kf2 {Forced.} b1=Q {As I talked about.  } 30. Rxb1 {But, now despite the loss, I had to do something because anything else would lead to mate, shortly after 30...Qe1+} Rxb1 31. Ke3 {So, now's the time where I decide to use my K as a weapon.  And, now I'm going to attempt to make use of the opposition anyway.  However, as I discover shortly after, it's of no use and more or less, irrelevant due to what's happened.} a5 {But, now, he's going to promote.  } 32. Kf4 {I did consider 32.Kd4 to stop this, but it's useless because that R, effectively prevents my K from reaching the b file, when it would have to take on the a file, to stop that pawn.  Plus, now I also see a potential mating sequence which I know can not be stopped.  With best play, I can delay it but not for long.  Of course, I'll just keep playing. } a4 {Making it's way, but to this time, a Q, and then some, as noted above.} 33. Ke3 {Still trying to delay by getting my K towards, and when you're lost like this, and you have the K as a main source, it's generally a good idea to get it right in the center, and move it back and try to do what you can to last longer.} a3 {Making it's way.} 34. Kd2 {?? Still seeing what I can do, but as it turns out, this is a blunder because it allows black to mate that much quicker.  Instead, best was 34.Kf4 and even after 34...a2 35.h4, a1=Q 36.h5, Rb5 37.Kg4, Qh1 38.Kg3, Rg5+ 39.Kf2, Qxg2+ 40.Ke3, Rxh5 41.Kd4, Qxf3} a2 {Going to promote, but this time, with no way to stop it.  And, it is also an example, of where the pawn chain is actually a good idea.  That's why I emphasized in previous annotations, but as I learned only recently with Jack by not making the mistake, it's not always a good idea to think that way.} 35. Kc2 {So, I'll keep my K as a weapon, and try to make it difficult, is the only way to describe, but it just makes it that much easier for black.} a1=Q 36. Kd3 {To prevent immediate, as the worry, was the black could use his R to check me on the first rank and mate, I played this.  But, it's not going to make a difference one way or another.} Rb3+ {It starts with this.} 37. Kc4 {I had other options, but bringing the K on the second rank, would immediately mean mate either with the Q or R.  This move, however, delays, but only for one more move.} Qc3+ {Like I said, even with a move longer, it's not any more difficult for black.} 38. Kd5 {Forced.} Rb5# {The only move that I did not calculate.  I thought his next move would be 38...Qa5+, in which I have a three options, but no matter he would have a mate in one.  But, I just did not realize that it was mate immediately.  Interesting game, but what I learned there is more involved of when taking is actually mistake, not just for immediate mate threats, but also about pawn promotions.  And, it's important to calcaulate but doing so accurately is important.  So, what I learned is one way to do that is by not mixing too many concept and while thinking ahead is important, don't overthink things.  Actually, in some cases, thinking about too many things like the strategy behind taking the pawn, or getting the K on c2, which was a mistake.  It's easy to follow what a lot of people say, but sometimes, there are limits and you can't do too much at one time, as that's where you start making mistakes.  And, thinking about too many things, in any position, can also cause problems, it's overthinking things, which in chess and life the idea is think, but then, let those thoughts go to avoid cramming, so that you can still concentrate on the position.}
