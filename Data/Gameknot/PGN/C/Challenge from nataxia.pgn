1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Bg2 Nf6 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. d4 {blacks knight adventure has given me some time. would like to start putting a little pressure on the centre.  also limits eventual ideas based on ...nc6 ...bg4 ...e5} e6 {This moves stops any ideas for the black queen's bishop on g4, h3 -- pressure to trade my kb, or support for a h7-h5 push.  As such it is a certainty that black intends to challenge d5 with a qb fianchetto.  i will look for opportunities to pin hi kb (c1-g5), prevent black qb fianchetto by opening the h1-a8 diagonal by repositioning my king's knight (f3-e1-c2..e3), and increase control of d5} 9. e4 {increasing control of d5, threats playing off a pin on black king's knight with c1-g5, opening e2 for c3 knight should protecting d4 become an issue (also supporting an eventual f4 push), removing f6-d5 as an option (furthering power of g5 pin). also supports a d5 push, which could be supported by d1-b3 (encouraging fianchetto of black bishop, but too late, as i would then immediately push d5, forcing either an exchange, or making it impossible for black bishop to complete fianchetto (bb7? d5xe6).} Nc6 {normal development.  also begins to attack d4.  black is falling behind in development, so this move, and i expect a fianchetto of qb to follow.  as d4 seems to be blacks early target, i don't expect a c8-d7 move from the bishop, which would be much too cramping and very passive.} 10. Bg5 {continuing with plan to control d5, pinning knight, encouraging black queen to either leave dfile, or try some sort of d8-d7, rd8, fianchetto, etc.  and of course, there is the threat of e5, which if allowed cannot be defended with h7...g5 pushing back of my bishop, as i will simply trade knight for those two pawns, tearing open black kingside when half his army is undeveloped, and taking on f6.  d5 deserves consideration.  however, i don't think there is a rush, i'd like to take some advantage of my lead in development by developing further, strongly, and i would like to give black another move or so, so as to get a sense of how he is planning to develop before opening up and possibly giving black counterchances.} b6 {black ignores the threat of e5, noticing his lack of activity perhaps too late. i will win a piece} 11. e5 Bb7 {this may be best.  black is going to lose a piece. further weakening his kingside with attacks on the g5 bishop would likely make things worse.  How can black use this "tempo" to his advantage? After 12. exf6 can black retreat to h8? it is unlikely that white can hold the f6 pawn, and perhaps it serves as a sort of blocker? desperate times...  However, expect 12 ... bxf6 13. bxf6 qxf6 and then work against the weak d4 pawn.  My best move then might be 14 d5 , before black gets in ...ne7, and even ...nf5} 12. exf6 Bxf6 13. Bxf6 Qxf6 14. Ne5 {i had originally considered d5 to be best here.  however, i think this is stronger. the immediate threat is nxc6, winning the knight.  as the black bishop is pinned, and there is no way for the knight to be protected or my knight to be attacked, the only move black has is 14. ... nb4 (14. ... nxn? 15 bxb7). at which point i can decide whether to trade bishops, or play nd7, forking queen and rook (which seems better, since the bishop trade looks like it is inevitable, so i'll let black use the tempo)} Rad8 {black misses the threat.  } 15. Bxc6 {I can capture with either knight or bishop.  I'd like to keep my bishop on the board, but leaving black with his neutralizes that somewhat, and leaves black with a still dangerous piece. there is also the weakness at d4.  i'd like to have the bishops off the board and a knight on c6, protecting d4, attacking a7, attacking the rook, and threatening nd7.  the knight maintains an escape square at e6, giving it further options.  should white black avoid the trade, his only option is 15 ...ba6, which after 16 re1 only strengthens my position, and removes any initiatiative the black qb had.}
