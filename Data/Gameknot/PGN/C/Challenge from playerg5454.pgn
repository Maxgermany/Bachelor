[Opening "Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45)"]

1. d4 {My opponent says he has had better luck with d4 openings.} Nf6 {My standard response, prevents (usually e4), develops my Knight.} 2. Bg5 {Aggressive, it seems to me!} e6 {This is my typical next move, prepares for d5, slows down White's pawns. } 3. e4 {He has taken the center.} Be7 {The Game DB really liked h6 here.  Maybe I should have done that, but I decided to develop more methodically with Be7, enabling castling. I was probably too conservative here.} 4. e5 {White is aggressive!  He puts the question to my Knight.} Ne4 {This was not in the database (Game DB). White must take.  The Queen re-takes.  White probably challenges my Knight with Nd2.  My opponent, who likes daring moves, would probably like me to sacrifice my Knight at f2, bring my Queen to h4 and start an attack.  White should be able to take the center pawns; so I'd be down only a pawn. It would teach White a lesson for pushing pawns so early in the game, which he cannot easily support if I act quickly and with daring. Hmmmm.} 5. Bd3 {White surprises me!  I don't win his piece, because the Black Knight has nowhere to go after h4.  I will attack his center with c5, and win his rook pawn on g5.  This promises to be a wild game, but first I must oblige him and take his Bishop with my Knight.} Nxg5 {Even after White's h4, Black has the better game. More than equality.  So White is playing tactics here, counting on an error and a fierce attack to win the day.  I expect h4.  I will counterplay in the center with c5, ultimately taking White's d pawn and opening avenues for my Queen to get in on the fun, maybe with Qa5+, or Qb6, Qb4+.  Alternatively, my Knight moves back to e4, lets the Bishop take him, then pushes d5; White takes en passant, exd6, cxd6, and Black ends up with a nice center, good development, the Bishop pair, maybe also White's KR pawn, though that gives White some attacking chances. Still, it seems as if White should be punished more.  Hmmmm.} 6. f4 {Another surprise.} Nc6 {Developing my Knight.} 7. fxg5 {I expected to lose the Knight, to the h pawn, to the f pawn, or to the Bishop on d3.} Nxd4 {This is the harder pawn to capture. If Qg4, then either Nc6, or Nxc2+, exchanging the Knight for the Rook or maybe ultimately winning it.  It will be hard to White to keep the g- and e-pawns now.  His attacking chances will soon peter out (I hope!).} 8. a3 {I think he needed to develop a piece, Nc3 or Nf3.  If he was worried about Bb4+, I'd have to prepare to avoid a fork of my Knight and Bishop.  He does not have time for this move.  I suppose he might have tried h5, or at some point even g6.  He'd lose the pawn anyway and he could mess up my pawn structure.} d6 {Maybe 9. exd6, Qxd6, but my opponent might have a more aggressive play in mind.} 9. c3 {No great moves here, but I would have developed a piece, like Nf3.} Nc6 {Black sits well. White will likely exchange pawns, and Black has a nice strong center, and at least one pawn up.} 10. Nh3 {I had expected exd6. But my opponent explained that he wanted to castle and put pressure on f7, which explains why he did not post his Knight on f3.  But . . . are his attacking chances worth the pawn he gave up on e5?  Of course, I don't think so.  But time will tell.} Nxe5 {White is down two.} 11. O-O O-O 12. Nf4 {Why not Nd2 or Bc2? I might as well take my pawn now on g5. My thinking is simply to develop my pieces, occupy the center. I expect to then move my Queenside pawns down the Board, with moves like a5, c5, b4, Qb6, Bb7 or Bd7, supported by my center. I will be eager to exchange pawns and pieces so that my relative advantage becomes proportionally bigger.} Bxg5 {I take the pawn.} 13. Bxh7+ {Hmmm.  What is my opponent thinking? I see that if I take the Bishop that White's Queen will check me soon on h5.  And White's Knight is nearby.  Is a mating net forming?  Is the Bishop "poisoned"?  Should I take it?  Or hide at h8?  Analyze tells me I can take the Bishop and withstand the attack. Maybe if White had more pieces in play . . . his chances would be better.} Kxh7 {I take, living dangerously, but also using the "Analyze" feature, which showed me that White's attack soon would fizzle out.} 14. Qh5+ {White's Queen strikes with 'Check!'} Bh6 {My Bishop blocks the Queen.  Ha ha} 15. Nh3 {Probably repositioning for g5+. But better would be Nd2 to get the Knight in the game, the Queen Rook, too.} Bd7 {I develop my Bishop.  The threat seems parried and I'm up a piece and two pawns.} 16. Nd2 {White develops his Knight (finally).} Bb5 {Developing a piece, threatening the Rook.} 17. c4 {c4?  Black is eager to exchange pieces given that Black is ahead, and Black's relative advantage will be greater with fewer pieces on the Board.  This is simple math.  Like 5/3 is less that 3/1.  Get it?  White has no great place for his Rook (e1 maybe), which is threatened.} Bxc4 {Black initiates an exchange.} 18. Nxc4 Nxc4 19. Rf3 {White prepares for another sally against the Black King's position, focusing on f7.} d5 {Black establishes control of the center and provides a space for its Knight to position itself to d6, to protect f7.  Black's Knight can easily reposition at d6 to protect  against White's threats at f7.  What is White up to? Doubling the rooks on the f file?  Knight to g5+, with pressure on Black's f pawn? [But Black's Queen would take the Knight.] Can Black defend f3? Of course, Black's King retreat to g8 provides another defender for f7, and frees the Bishop to attack g5. Opening the f or g file could work for Black, opening the game, with Black's superior forces.} 20. Raf1 {White is up to attack f7.} Nd6 {Black protects f7.} 21. Rf3f4 {White might be thinking of Rh5.} g6 {But there's no time.  g6 forces the White Queen to move.} 22. Qh4 {White lets its Rook and Queen be threatened with g5.  White should have moved to e5.} g5 {Winning a piece or forcing an exchange and winning a pawn.  More importantly, Black is happy to exchange pieces to simplify and get to the endgame.} 23. Nxg5+ {White elects to exchange.} Qxg5 {Black is eager to exchange, so that its relative advantage increases.  Remember, this is simple math.  White has three major pieces to Black's five, with the relative points being 26 for Black and 20 for White.  That's an advantage of 26/20= 1.3.  I omitted the pawns for simplicity, though Black is two pawns up.  If White exchanges its Queen for the two Rooks (and a pawn), the relative advantage becomes 16/10, or 1.6 -- a greater advantage for Black.} 24. Qe1 Qxf4 {Black exchanges for the reason mentioned earlier, increasing its relative advantage. My opponent thought I had made a mistake, . . . but I think not!} 25. Rxf4 Bxf4 {White is down 9.  He really has no good moves left. But he has a lot of energy. } 26. h4 {Another attack?} e5 {Black control the center, with its Bishop defended and in a central position.} 27. h5 {?  But what can he do?  } Rfg8 {Black marshalls its Rooks on the open file.  Nimsovitsch advised to seize the open file. The White King must be mated. Soon the Knight will come up to help seal the deal. This is the beginning of the end. White just has his Queen. Against two rooks, a Bishop and Knight, Black's center and supporting pawns.} 28. Qd1 {Always attacking.} Nf5 {Black can spare a few pawns to create a mating net.} 29. Qxd5 {White grabs a pawn, having nothing better.  But he knows the end is near.} Ne3 {This is nice isn't it? The Queen is directly attacked, and the King threatened.} 30. Qe4+ {This looks aggressive, but helps me solidify my constellation of attacking pieces and pawns.} f5 {Isn't this nice? Everything is protecting each other. White can pick off a few more pawns on the Queen's side of the Board, but mate is coming on the other side of the Board.} 31. Qxb7 {The Queen is munching on my pawns!} Rad8 {I give up the pawns for a mate, which feels certain now. The Queen Rook gets the assignment so my King can be protected from checks.} 32. Qxc7+ {Her last attack.} Kh8 {The King is safe from any harassment here.} 33. Kf2 {The King's  move doesn't help and makes the mate faster.  The King moves forward.  This is like "death by cop." } Rd2+ {Ke1 prolongs the agony.  But mate is inevitable.  For fun, I anticipated every reasonable move, and a few unreasonable ones, and programmed them as conditional moves.   34. Ke1 Rdxg2 35. Qxa7 Bg3# Edit • Delete	 34. Ke1 Rdxg2 35.

But he'll win more games using the Analyze feature, and 'Flip' to see the board like his opponent does.  Using the Game DB feature may help his opening. Getting your pieces developed before an attack is often helpful.  Attacks that work in over the board chess often fail in correspondence chess where time pressure is almost nonexistent and the Analyze feature enables players to play out positions.} 34. Kf3 {He chooses a quick death.} Rg3# {We both had fun!}
