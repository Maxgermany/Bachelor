1. e4 e5 {We open up our kings' pawns to free our queens or kingside bishops...} 2. f3 d5 {...and I free my other bishop...} 3. exd5 Qxd5 {...then we trade pawns...} 4. Nc3 {...and as he develops his knight...} Qe6 {...my queen retreats.} 5. b3 {He moves his second-left pawn (aka b-pawn), no doubt hoping to fianchetto his bishop...} Nc6 {...so my knight comes up to give my king's pawn extra cover. (This pawn had not moved since my first move; the pawn I lost was my queen's pawn.)} 6. Bc4 {His light-square bishop attacks my queen...} Qf5 {...so I move her forwards...} 7. g4 {...and is pressured by his second right pawn (aka g-pawn)...} Qg6 {...so she retreats.} 8. h4 {He moves his right flank pawn (aka h-pawn)...} Nb4 {...and I advance my knight, hoping to fork the king and rook...} 9. d3 {...but his queen's pawn sees to that.} Be6 {So I develop my light-square bishop to pressure his (as capturing it would mean no need to distort my pawn structure; my queen could recapture)...} 10. h5 {...but the kingside rook's pawn places the queen under attack...} Qf6 {...so she moves to the only safe place.} 11. Bg5 {My opponent attacks her with his bishop, but it had no support...} Qxg5 {...so my queen accepts the gift...} 12. Ne4 {...and although the knight attacks her...} Qe3+ {...she advances to the 6th rank to place the king under attack...} 13. Qe2 {...and as he blocks with his queen...} Nxc2+ {...she is pinned to the e2 and e3 squares, exposing her bishop's pawn, so my knight removes it, and performs the fork it was hoping to do, four moves earlier...} 14. Kd1 Qxe2+ {...allowing my queen to remove his, protecting the knight...} 15. Kxe2 {...and although he recaptures...} Nxa1 {...my knight captures the rook, giving me an advantage of a rook, bishop and pawn.} 16. Nh3 {As he brings out his other knight...} Bxc4 {...I capture his remaining bishop...} 17. dxc4 {...but lose my light-square one...} Nc2 {..and my knight must now retreat away from the other rook...} 18. Nc3 {...and as he moves his knight, no doubt hoping to eventually perform a fork like mine...} O-O-O {...I castle queenside to bring my queenside rook into play.} 19. Ng5 {His kingside knight advances to my 4th rank, no doubt hoping to fork my rooks...} Nh6 {...so mine moves onto the rim to cover the f7 square (the square where the fork would be performed).} 20. Nd5 Bb4 {I move up my bishop to free my kingside rook, and to restrict the king's movement (and no doubt hope to win a knight for it)...} 21. Rc1 {...but the rook attacks my knight...} Nd4+ {...so it retreats, to be covered by my king's pawn, and to attack my opponent's king.} 22. Kd3 Bc3 {What was I thinking moving my bishop there...} 23. Rxc3 {...and not noticing the rook?} Rxd5 {I deliberately remove his queenside knight...} 24. cxd5 {...for my rook to avoid nasty surprises from a combination of two knights and a rook...} Rd8 {...so my remaining rook lines up the pawn back on the d-file...} 25. Ke4 {...but as the king covers it...} f6 {...I move up my kingside bishop's pawn to protect my king's pawn...} 26. Nxh7 {...but lose my rook's pawn on the same side...} f5+ {...so the bishop's pawn attacks the king...} 27. Kxe5 {...and as he captures my king's pawn...} Ne2 {...my knight moves onto the 7th rank to deny him access to the neighbouring d- and f-files on my 5th rank (the kingside knight's and queenside's bishop's pawns (4th rank), and my kingside knight and my opponent's d-pawn (on d5) also do likewise)...} 28. Rd3 {...but as he moves his rook along the rank it was on, instead of moving his pawn on d5 or his knight (rook to c6 or c7 would mean capture by my pawn or king)...} Re8# {...my rook can trap his king for a rook (e4, e5, e6), two knight (d4, f4, f5) and three pawn (e4, d6, f6, d5 being his own) checkmate.}
