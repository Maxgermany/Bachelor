1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {c3 is a very interesting move, I used to play it myself a bit because it was in the first opening book I ever read.  Igor Nikolayev, the strongest player in Rochester, also plays the move.} d5 {This is a pretty useful way to counter c3 and it's a good move in similar situations.  Since white is trying to set up both his pawns in the center, black tries to break them up.  Also, white doesn't have the option of chasing the queen with exd5, Qxd5 and Nc3 because the pawn is in the way.} 4. d4 {I'm not so sure about this move, it seems to allow black to get at least an equal position.  I believe the most challenging move for black is Bb5, pinning my knight.  Then if black plays dxe4 white plays Nxe5 and has some threats.  I think that black has ways to fight through it in that case as well, but it's much more tricky.  Also, white is side with the initiative, which is a nicer position to be in.} dxe4 5. Nxe5 Nxe5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+ 7. Kxd1 {I thought these moves were pretty much forced, now it seems like black's pawn on e4 is easier to defend than white's on e5.  Also, white has given up the right to castle and his king is on the open d-file.  Even though the queens have been traded, we're still in a middlegame so having a safer king is good for black.} Bf5 {I thought about various ways to go after e5, but I like this move.  I know that I'm going to have to play it sooner or later, so I may as well defend the pawn now.  By playing the defensive move first it gives me freedom to go on the offense later.  They call this prophylaxis and it's a pretty useful chess idea.} 8. Be3 {This is a nice move, I was hoping to play Bc5 and attack your f-pawn.} Ne7 9. Nd2 Ng6 10. f4 {It's not easy to defend the e-pawn, but I think this is a mistake.  I get to trade off my weak pawn and we're left in a situation where you just have a weakness without much compensation.  One idea would be to play Nc4, which defends the pawn for a little bit at least.  I could chase it away with b5, but then maybe Na5 and trying to counter attack on the queen side.  You probably will lose the e-pawn, but at least you will have counter-play.  Another idea would be to play e6.  Then if I want to take that pawn I need to play fxe6.  At that point I would be up a pawn, but my pawns would be doubled and both would be weaknesses.  The general idea here is if you are going to be in a worse position, you want to at least have some sort of counter-chances.  One thing that I'm still learning now by looking at grandmaster games, is how they will almost always choose this.} exf3 e.p. 11. Nxf3 a6 {Some more prophylaxis.  I want to play O-O-O, but I was afraid of Bxa7, then if I try b6, you have Ba6+.} 12. Bc4 {I liked this move, since it stops my plan of O-O-O.  But the downside is that the bishop is going to be attacked if I play Nxe5.  This makes it a good time for Bg4.  I think I could have played it last move or even before that, but now it has a pretty strong effect.} Bg4 13. Ke1 Bxf3 14. gxf3 Nxe5 15. Be2 O-O-O 16. f4 {I think you definitely wanted to stop Nd3.  Having 2 bishops is usually considered better than a knight and bishop, especially in a position like this that's pretty wide open, not blocked up with pawns.  The bishops coordinate vary well together and give you some compensation for being down a pawn.  With that in mind, maybe Rd1 was the best move.} Nd3+ 17. Bxd3 Rxd3 18. Ke2 Rd5 19. Rad1 Rxd1 20. Rxd1 {I was pretty happy to trade off Rooks.  Since I'm up a pawn, the less pieces on the board the better for me.  I didn't like the fact that both of your pieces were more active than mine, but I saw that Bd6 would block the file for your rook.} Bd6 21. h4 {I like this move, although I'm not sure if you played it for the reason I thought.  I thought you were going to play h5 and h6 if possible to try to exchange your pawn for mine.  My pawns on the kingside have less weaknesses than yours, so it makes sense for you to try to trade.} Re8 22. Kf3 Kd7 {I couldn't see what to do here.  But we're definitely in the endgame by now, so I figured getting my king active couldn't be bad.} 23. b4 {Here I was thinking either h5 or Rg1 and if I play g6 then h5.  I was probably going to play Bf8 and play h6 after you played h5.  I thought that created the least amount of weaknesses on the kingside.} Kc6 24. a4 b5 25. Ra1 {I think this is a mistake and after this I was winning.  I couldn't see a way for you to stop my king from getting very active and making too many threats for you to handle.  I think you had to play axb5.  If I take back with the a pawn, then you can keep your rook on the d-file and it's hard for me to get my king to a good spot.  I probably would have tried moving my rook to the a-file and getting it active that way, but I couldn't see exactly how it would turn out.  If I take with my king, then you can play Ra1 and we are in a similar situation as the game, but my pawns are much more weak.  Again, it would be hard to move my king without loosing the a6 pawn.} Kd5 26. axb5 axb5 27. Ra5 Kc4 28. Bd2 Kd3 29. Ra2 {This allows a pin that seals the game, but if Bc1 I play Re1 and was going to go for Rf1+, Rxf4 and probably win the h-pawn as well.} Re2 30. f5 Rxd2 31. Ra5 Kc4 32. Ra6 Rd3+ 33. Ke4 {All in all a good game and you definitely surprised me with how strong you played.  If I had one piece of advice it would be to try to play actively when you get in a tough position.  It's tempting to try to stay solid and protect everything, but that often leads to a situation where the other person is able to slowly increase their advantage.  Sometimes it works, but I think usually it's best to try to get counter-chances.  At the least, if you go down, you go down swinging :)}
