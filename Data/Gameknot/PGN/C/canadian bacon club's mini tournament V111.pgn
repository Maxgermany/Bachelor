1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 {With the. Idea of eventually exchanging on f6 to open the g-file and creating a pawn weakness on f6} a6 8. Na3 b5 {Abitibipower has expanded rapidly in order to counter Elyhims plans on the kingside} 9. Bxf6 {Almost necessary because freeing the d5 point allows white to create some breathing room for his two knights on the queenside. It also forces black to mess up his pawn structure. Something he will have to resolve in order to fight for an advantage. } gxf6 10. Nd5 f5 {Black plays to unravel his pawns and get rid of the knight on d5. White can not stop the attack against his knight but he will try exact a even better concession from black} 11. Bd3 Be6 {Threatening ...Bxd5} 12. O-O {The knight is doomed so I pull the life support. In exchange black gives up his best bishop which he will sorely miss in a few moves. My pawn on d5 is not ideally but it keeps the centre closed so I can attack f5 with fury. } Bxd5 13. exd5 Ne7 {Black has to be strategically better here due to his strong centre. However, he in cramped and has the problem sub par development. At this point I thought I had to start playing or I will be losing. } 14. c3 {! I give this an exclamation mark not because of it is brilliant but because of it achieves. It opens a super highway for the knight and gives the bishop on d3 an escape route.  } Bg7 {Some would be tempted to play 14...e4?! But when you are behind in development it is very unwise to expand in the centre. } 15. Qh5 {Puts the queen on a very active square and threatens too win a pawn} Qd7 16. Rae1 {Anticipating ...e4 } O-O 17. Bb1 {The bishop retreats for now} h6 18. Red1 {Defending d5 which allows me to start a bold wing attack without fearing counter play against what is left of my centre. } f4 {Freeing f5 for use by the knight. } 19. Kh1 {I find these types of moves very tough to play against. It kinda leaves you thinking as to what your opponent is doing. But here white's scheme is quite easy to see. He wants to play Rg1 followed by g3 to open the g-file with the white rook staring down the black king. Abitibipower will need nerves of steel!} f5 20. Rfg1 Qb7 {Abitibipower tries to hold me back by attacking weak d5 pawn. But I am a dog with a bone nothing will stop me} 21. Nc2 {I am prepared to go down a pawn temporarily in order to activate my knight. } a5 {hum, which is what I thought about this move. This may not seem that significant but it is because it signals the turning point of the game into whites favour. Up until now black has played actively quietly going about executing his own plan and ideas. Here ...a5 is reactionary, designed to keep the white knight out of b4. What black should have done is play 21...Rf6 followed by ...Nf6 and ...Qf7. } 22. f3 {! I played this with an air of superiority knowing full well that black was going to be up to his knees in trouble. } Rf6 23. g4 Raf8 {Black entombed himself! Better was 22...Nxd5} 24. Ne1 {!! Now this is fully deserving of the props. } Qd7 25. Nd3 {Threatening 26.Nf2 with a very strong advantage.} Qa7 {The lesser of two evils. Prevents Nf2 but losses the f5 point} 26. gxf5 Nxf5 {Now the bishop that retreated to b1 has awoken from his slumber and the pressure around the light squares of abitibipower's king are lethal. } 27. Qh3 Kh8 28. Rde1 {Avoids ...Ne3 and intending re2 followed by rg2 maybe. } Ne7 29. Re2 Rg6 30. Rxg6 Nxg6 31. Nf2 {For the win! } Ne7 32. Ne4 {Threatening ...d6 } Qc7 33. Rg2 Qc8 34. Qxc8 Nxc8 35. Rg6 Rd8 36. Bd3 {Abitibipower does not have enough fingers to plug the dike. } b4 37. c4 {D6 is toast! } a4 38. Nxd6 {?? Oh my god what was I thinking. In truth I was getting ahead of myself. I was suppose to play Bc2 and black goes down two pawns. } Nxd6 {I am soo mad with myself} 39. c5 e4 40. Bc2 Nf7 41. fxe4 Ra8 {Abitibipower is like a killer whale. } 42. b3 Bd4 43. c6 f3 44. c7 Rc8 45. d6 Be5 46. Rxh6+ Kg7 47. Rh3 Nxd6 48. Rxf3 Rxc7 {I had enough black will win another pawn and the game is over. Well play friend! }
