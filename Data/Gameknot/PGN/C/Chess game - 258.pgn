1. d4 e6 2. c4 f5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 Be7 5. Qc2 b6 6. g3 Bb7 7. Bg2 a5 {probably unnecessary.   maybe even bad.} 8. O-O O-O 9. a3 Na6 {this isn't a great square for the knight, but it doesn't block the bishop.} 10. Bf4 Ne4 11. Nd2 Nxc3 12. Qxc3 {I think this is best.   If 12.Bxb7, then 12...Nxe2+ 13.Kh1 Ra7 } Bxg2 13. Kxg2 g5 14. Be3 f4 15. gxf4 g4 {I played this thinking that 15...gxf4 16.Bxf4 Rxf4 17.Qg3+ was much better for White because he wins back the rook. It turns out he wins back a bishop instead.   17.Qg3+ Bg5 18.h4 Rxh4 19.f4  I think this is how the line runs.    I haven't rechecked it, so I'm analyzing it blindfold pretty well.     Could be wrong.  This might be a better option than what I played in the game, but I have a ways to go developing still and my king is weak. Comments welcome.} 16. Rfg1 Bd6 17. Kh1 h5 18. Qd3 {This is strong!} Rf5 19. Nf1 Qf6 20. Ng3 Kf7 21. Nxf5 exf5 22. c5 Be7 23. cxb6 Qe6 {a really horrible move} 24. d5 Qe4+ 25. Qxe4 fxe4 26. bxc7 Nxc7 27. Rgd1 Bd6 28. Rac1 Rb8 29. Rc2 Rb3 30. Rd4 Kf6 31. Rxe4 Nxd5 32. Rd4 Nxe3 33. fxe3 Rb6 34. Rcd2 Ke6 35. Rd4xd6+ Rxd6 36. Rxd6+ Kxd6 37. Kg2 h4 38. e4 {almost everything wins at this point, but white could have tried 38.b4 to make his extra queenside pawn worth something.} a4 39. f5 {now black can never capture on e4} Ke5 40. Kf2 d5 41. exd5 Kxd5 42. e4+ Ke5 43. Ke3 {Black resigned here.    If 43...h3, then 44.Kf2 and Black can't defend his pawns.}
