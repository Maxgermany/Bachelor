[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {Another favorite opening of mine.} Nf6 {Fighting for control of the middle board here.} 2. e3 {Protecting my other pawn, opening the way for my LSB.} d5 {Good response; d5 is always a good square to occupy.} 3. Bb5+ {Why not, just to force him to make a play that is different from what he intended?} Nbd7 {Getting his knight in play while protecting his king. Good play on black's part.} 4. c3 {Why did I do this? I inadvertently blocked my b-column knight from moving...} e6 {Getting his DSB in play} 5. Nf3 {Paving the way for a kingside castle...} a6 {Threatening my bishop and diverting my attention...} 6. Bxd7+ {Taking his knight} Nxd7 {He responds.} 7. Ne5 {Challenging him; how will he respond?} Be7 {I don't know what his bishop is doing...} 8. Nxd7 {Taking his knight.} Bxd7 {He responds.} 9. Nd2 {Trying to get my knight out of there.} Bb5 {Black's LSB enters play...} 10. Nb3 {My knight needed two moves to get out.} O-O {He castles} 11. Bd2 {Trying to get my DSB out; my pawns are not making it easy} Rc8 {Not sure what he's doing} 12. Qc2 {I didn't know what to do, since his bishop prevents me from castling. I thought maybe I could queenside castle, instead.} c5 {Threatening my pawn} 13. dxc5 {I take his pawn, creating an opening for my knight} Bxc5 {And he responds, making it harder for my knight again.} 14. Nxc5 {So I do this.} Rxc5 {Unfortunately, that gave him an opportunity to get his rook out.} 15. e4 {Trying to clear up some pawn congestion.} dxe4 {He responds.} 16. Qxe4 {And so do I} Rd5 {Black is trying to gain an advantage here, using a combination of queen and d5 rook to take my bishop. (rook takes my bishop and I can't retaliate)} 17. Qc2 {I see through his ploy and move to stop it.} Bd3 {He's trying to keep me from keeping him from executing his plan.} 18. Qd1 {Move my queen out of the way.} Qb6 {His queen enters the game.} 19. Be3 {Threatening his queen} Qxb2 {He takes my undefended pawn} 20. Qc1 {At the very least, I might be able to get him to sacrifice his queen for mine.} Qxc3+ {Smart move to make, but then I get his queen without losing mine.} 21. Qxc3 {Like so.} Rfd8 {Trying to make up for the loss of his queen} 22. Rb1 {Aiming for his pawn at b7} b5 {He sees through it} 23. Rd1 {Not sure what I was trying to accomplish here} Bc4 {Threatening my rook} 24. Rxd5 {I take the initiative} Rxd5 {He responds. } 25. Bd4 {Aiming for his g-column pawn} Bxa2 {I left my pawn unattended; he took it} 26. Ke2 {Trying to prevent my king from being trapped} Bc4+ {Put me in check because he could} 27. Kd2 {Getting out of check} a5 {Trying to promote his pawns} 28. Ra1 {Getting my rook into play; aiming for a back rank checkmate} e5 {Threatening my bishop} 29. Qxa5 {This was a mistake; I should have protected my bishop first.} Rxd4+ {He takes the bishop and checks me} 30. Kc1 {Trying to escape check} h6 {Giving his king an escape route} 31. Qa8+ {One move too late on the back rank check, but I think, "why not?"} Kh7 {Escaping check} 32. Ra6 {I didn't know what to do at this point, so I did this} b4 {Trying to promote pawn} 33. Qc6 {Still didn't know what to do next} Bxa6 {Accidentally let him take my rook; oops.} 34. Qxa6 {Responding to his play} f5 {Moving his pawn; perhaps he wants to distract me.} 35.

Qf1 {Protecting my pawn} f4 {Moving his pawn} 40. Kc5 {Aiming for his d pawn now.} Rd2 {Trying to prevent me from taking it.} 41. Qc4 {Protecting my king} Rh2 {Trying to take my pawn again} 42. Qe6 {Protecting my pawn} f3 {Trying to promote his pawn} 43. Qxe5 {I take his pawn} Rxh3 {He takes my pawn} 44. Qf5+ {I discovered this brilliant move on accident; all I was intending to do was to put him in check, but I ended up pinning his rook, too. } g6 {Protecting his king} 45. Qxh3 {Taking his rook} h5 {Don't know what he's doing here. A better move might have been to try and promote his f-column pawn.} 46. Qxf3 {Taking his unprotected pawn; he resigns.}
