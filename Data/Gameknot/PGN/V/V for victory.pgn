[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), English defence"]

1. d4 b6 {Not a defense that I see very often. Black wants to develop the light squared bishop to the long diagonal early.} 2. Nd2 {My idea is to give my king's knight some cover on f3 with a piece. e3 or e4 would have accomplished the same thing. The disadvantage is that my dark square bishop is closed off. I compensated later in the game by putting my queenside pawns on dark squares.} Bb7 3. Ngf3 h6 {I was a little confused by this move. Nf3 would have been better to prevent the e4 push.} 4. e4 {Creating a nice strong center here. I had thoughts of limiting black's light square bishop.} e6 {Trying for some influence in the center and looking to develop the dark squared bishop.} 5. Bb5 {Delaying black's possible push to d5.} a6 {Black kicks my bishop around for a couple moves.} 6. Ba4 b5 7. Bb3 {A fairly natural square for the light square bishop.} Bb4 8. c3 {Breaking the pin and chasing the bishop.} Ba5 9. O-O {Ahead in development, not a bad time to castle.} Nf6 10. Bc2 {Defending my pawn. Perhaps too passive of a move, but it does open up the possibility for a b4 push in the future. I wasn't looking to chase the f6 knight just yet.} O-O 11. b4 {Thinking about a queenside pawn attack.} Bb6 12. a4 Nh7 {Perhaps thinking about relocating to g5 at some point in the future. Also preparing for an f5 push. Yet, black is behind in development and has decreased influence in the center with this move. Also a bad square for a knight.} 13. e5 {Looking for an attack along the b1-h7 diagonal.} f5 {Cutting off the attack. I thought about capturing e.p., but decided that a partially open f file wasn't attractive.} 14. a5 {The reverse flying V. Not a particularly strong pawn structure, but it looks cool.} Ba7 15. Nb3 Nc6 16. Qd3 {Still thinking I have an attack along that diagonal.} Ne7 {eying the outpost on d5 and defending the f pawn.} 17. Rd1 {Planning to open up the d file in the near future and threatening the base of the d7-f5 pawn chain.} Be4 {The most aggressive move made by black so far.} 18. Qe2 {Forced. Couldn't leave the light square bishop hanging, and didn't want to expose my king.} Bxf3 {Good thinking to trade bishop for knight in a closed game, but this is black's good bishop and my knight on f3 wasn't very active. If his plan was to take the knight, why not on the previous move?} 19. Qxf3 c6 {Opposing Vs.} 20. Nc5 Bxc5 21. dxc5 Qe8 22. Rd6 {I overlooked Nc8 chasing my rook from the outpost.} Nd5 {So did black. } 23. Bb3 Ng5 24. Bxg5 {I was perhaps a little too excited to get rid of my bad bishop. Black may have had enough time to take advantage of the partially open h file.} hxg5 25. Re1 {Giving some support to my isolated e pawn. Also putting some pressure on black's queen.} g4 26. Qd1 {Oops, I left my c3 pawn hanging. Better was Qd1} Ra7 {Black missed the chance for a free pawn and a tempo on the queen. Ra7 doesn't really do much here. I won't be able to zero in on the d7 pawn if black leaves the knight on d5. This may be the time to start stacking up on the h file.} 27. Bxd5 exd5 {This was black's critical mistake. This allows for a nice juicy open e file for white to exploit.} 28. e6 dxe6 29. Rexe6 Qh5 {I don't think that there's enough time to mount a counter-attack on the h file.} 30. Rdxc6 Kf7 31. Rcxa6 Rxa6 {Probably the losing move for black.} 32. Rxa6 Rh8 {Sets up the winning combination for white.} 33. Qxd5+ Ke7 34. Qb7+ Kf8 35. Ra8+ {Black resigns realizing that his remaining pieces will fall.}
