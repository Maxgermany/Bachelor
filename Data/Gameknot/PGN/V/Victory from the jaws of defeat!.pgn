1. d4 {Hi everyone!  Yet again I get struck down by passivitis and my Class C opponent brews up a really nasty attack which leaves my King Henry shivering under the familiar dark dark shadow of Old Matey.  Somehow my opponent takes his foot off the gas and gives me much needed breathing space which enables my queen, Glenda, to mount a lone wolf counter-attack on King Rick.  It is all hope chess but luckily Rick overlooks a saving move which would have kept his attack going.  Rick's mistake, however, ensures that his attack is stopped short and never to go again when his old King died.  So, how did this happen?  Well, read on. } d6 2. e4 {2. e4 -  after my non-committal d6 move Rick is able to advance his two central pawns.} g6 {2. ...... g6 - preparing a kingside fianchetto to try and challenge that pawn centre.} 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Nf3 Nf6 {4. ..... Nf6 - over the course of a few moves both sides have developed their pieces.  Although white looks more active I am ready to tuck Henry away on the kingside.} 5. Be2 O-O 6. O-O c6 {6. ..... c6 - still non-committal.} 7. h3 Nbd7 8. Be3 Qc7 {8. ..... Qc7 - I am clearing the decks as quickly as possible but white still looks to have the better scope.} 9. a4 b6 {9. ....... b6 - freeing up a square for Fou Leblanc.} 10. Qd2 e5 {10. ..... e5 - finally I challenge the centre.} 11. dxe5 dxe5 {11. .... dxe5 - after that pawn trade my position looks a little less cramped but white still has a lotta play here!} 12. b4 Bb7 {12. ...... Bb7 - finally the decks are cleared.} 13. Rad1 Rad8 14. Bd3 Nb8 15. Qe2 Rfe8 {15. ....Rfe8 - just faffing around here, although my e-pawn is doubly defended.} 16. Bc4 Bf8 {16. .... Bf8 - sneaky retreat by Fou Lenoir attacks b5 pawn.} 17. Ng5 {17. .... Ng5, uh oh - f7 pawn doubly attacked by N & lsb and only defended by Henry.  The only way to avoid losing material outright is to play Re7.  This move blocks off Fou Lenoir's diagonal to b5.} Re7 18. b5 c5 {18. ..... c5 - doing what comes naturally, trying to block out my opponent.} 19. Bd5 Bxd5 20. exd5 {20. exd5 - this trade off has given Rick a very strong passed pawn.  This is just horrible for black.} Red7 21. Qf3 Kg7 {21. ..... Kg7 - forced - to defend the knight on f6.} 22. Rd2 Bd6 23. Nce4 Nxe4 24. Nxe4 {24. Nxe4 - this move is forced but now Qf6+ is threatened so I am now forced to move Fou Lenoir back to e7 but risk a possible pawn fork on d6 aaargh and double aaargh!!} Be7 25. Rfd1 {25. Rfd1 - piling on the pressure.} f5 {25. ..... f5 - nothing better.} 26. Ng5 Bxg5 27. Bxg5 Re8 {27. ...... Re8 - Well, at least the B for N exchange has avoided Fou Lenoir and Glenda getting caught in a pawn fork on d6 but my position is still very bad.} 28. d6 Qc8 29. c4 {29. ...... c4 - preparing a Q invasion on d5.} h6 30. Be7 Rb7 {30. ...... Rb7 - to prepare a change of blockader.  I am planning to block the d6 pawn with Nd7.  At least it gets my knight of the rim but alas my game stays - GRIM!!} 31. Qd5 Nd7 {31. ..... Nd7 - Rick's queen gets to d5 as predicted but at least I can safely move my knight to d7.  At least my knight also protects the vulnerable pawn at e4 but I feel an absolute zugzwang is not too far away.} 32. Rd2d3 Rg8 33. Rg3 Kh7 34. h4 Rg7 {34. ..... Rg7 - still alive - but for how long?  Rick is now planning a kingside pawn storm.} 35. Rdd3 Rb8 36. h5 Qg8 {36. ..... Qg8 - desperately offering a queen trade.  My opponent declines it.} 37. Qc6 Qe6 {37. ..... Qe6 - Glenda is slightly more active, but as she is tied to the defense of my d7 knight, will this do any good?  I hardly dare breathe.} 38. hxg6+ Rxg6 39. Rxg6 Kxg6 {39. ..... Kxg6 - forced as Qxg6?? loses to Qxe7.} 40. Rg3+ Kh7 41. Qc7 f4 {41. ..... f4 - after that plethora of exchanges so begins my counterplay.} 42. Rh3 Rg8 {42. ..... Rg8 - YE GODS! As Coach Ion would say!  I am actually THREATENING something.  What is that?} 43. Kh1 Qg4 {43. ...... Qg4 This is the hope chess move.  There are two mates threatened here.  Qb7 would deal with both threats but luckily for me my opponent only deals with one and allows a backranker.} 44. Rh2 Qd1# {44. ..... Qd1 MAAATE!!  WHEEEW AND TREBLE WHEEEEW!  }
