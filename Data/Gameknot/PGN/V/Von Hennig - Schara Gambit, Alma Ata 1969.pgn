1. d4 {This is my first annotation of a game which was not mine. There is general agreement that the mainline of this gambit begins after the following 11 moves. But even here the middlegame is not defined, as Black can castle in either direction. It has become increasingly clear that Black's compensation for his pawn is long-lasting.} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. cxd5 cxd4 5. Qa4+ Bd7 6. Qxd4 exd5 7. Qxd5 Nc6 8. Nf3 Nf6 9. Qd1 Bc5 10. e3 Qe7 11. Be2 O-O-O {The traditional treatment is to go queenside, but in recent games the patient approach with kingside castling has been revived.} 12. O-O g5 {g5!? going for a potential attack of the defended king.} 13. Nd4 {This move prepares for white's g4 move, and the Two Knights Defence looks quite strong.} g4 14. b4 {Gambit attempting to move the Bishop, similar to the Evan's Gambit.} Bxb4 {Gambit accepted and pawn regained.} 15. Bb2 {Now both sides are pretty much fully developed. Only problem for Black is the open file in front of his King. Can be easily defended though with his Bishops and two Knights.} h5 {h5!? Now Black is pressuring White's kingside.} 16. Ncb5 Kb8 17. Qa4 {Qa4?! 17.Qb3! a6 18.Nxc6 Bxc6 19.Nd4 Bd5 20.Bc4} a6 18. Nxc6+ {Black is in quite a worrying position due to the white's knights.} Bxc6 19. Bxf6 Qxf6 {Qxf6? Here is where Black missed his chance. Kholmov came up with the following line: 19...Qe4! 20.f3 Qxe3+ 21.Kh1 Qxe2 22. Qxb4 Rd2! 23.Qf4+ Ka8 24.Nc7+ Kb8 25.Nd5+ (25.Nb5+=) Ka8 26.Ne3 gxf3 27. gxf3 Re8 claiming compensation for the piece. In a book in 1984, Leonid, Shamkovich and Schiller extended the analysis further: 28.Rae1 Bxf3+ 29.Rxf3 Qxe1+ 30.Nf1 Ree2 31.Qc7 (Bh4 Rxh2+!)} 20. Qxb4 axb5 21. Bxb5 {Black has a very vulnerable kingside defense now with the a and c pawn gone.} Qd6 {Trying to exchange off the dangerous white queen.} 22. Rab1 {White defends his queen and plans for a 23.Bxc6 then 24.Qxb7#} Bd5 {Avoiding the threat from being taken by the light squared Bishop.} 23. a4 {Potential and dangerous pass pawn march.} f5 {Black goes for white's king.} 24. Qxd6+ Rxd6 25. Rbd1 Rhd8 {An exchange of queens, with black now with a strong attack. The exchange of queens was poor by white, as white lost his dangerous threats.} 26. f3 Be6 {White saw black's plan of Bxg2!} 27. Rxd6 Rxd6 28. fxg4 fxg4 {The exchange of pawns and rooks, has began the endgame.} 29. Rf8+ Ka7 30. Rh8 Rd5 31. Kf2 Rc5 {Rc5!? What was this move going to do?} 32. e4 Rc2+ 33. Kg3 Rc3+ 34. Kf4 {White's king has been pushed into a vulnerable place in the centre of the board. Only around 5 6 moves ago he looked well defended.White now has a problem with his pawns on g2 and h2, however white can exchange off pawns with..} Rc2 35. Rxh5 Rxg2 36. Rh6 {I feel white and black really need to get their bishops involved...} Bb3 37. e5 Ra2 38. e6 {Black here could win the a4 pawn, but really needs to stop that pawn on e6 before it promotes, and curtains for Black.} Bxa4 {Bxa4? as helps White's pawn to advance. However 39.e7?? as Bxb5! stops the pawn from accessing the e8 square.} 39. Bxa4 Rxa4+ 40. Kf5 Ra2 41. e7 {e7 1-0 Black resigns here as 41.Re2 can be stopped by 41...Re6!
