1. e4 {This game was played in a Thematic MT hosted by Jongraft.  The initial position starts after 4. Nxd4} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {I'm sure this game may prove to have errors & missed opportunities for both sides.  However, it was fun to play & has a dramatic ending.  } Nf6 {So Black opens with 4...Nf6} 5. Nc3 e5 6. Nf3 Bb4 7. Bc4 {I ignore the threat to my e pawn} Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 Nxe4 {Beware the hanging pawn!} 9. Qd5 {Threatens mate at f7 & the hanging Knight.} O-O 10. Qxe4 Re8 11. O-O Qa5 12. Bd2 Rd8 {Black wants to fork my Queen & Bishop} 13. Bd3 g6 14. Rfe1 d6 15. c4 Qb6 16. Bh6 {Starting the attack.} Bf5 17. Qh4 {After Qh4 I saw  17         ...f6 18.Qxf6  Qc7 !9. Bxf5  gxf5 20.Qxf5} f6 18. Qxf6 Rd7 {Rd7?  I believe this to be Black's key error in the game.  } 19. Bxf5 gxf5 20. Qxf5 {Qe6  is probably better here.  I figured he would play Rf7 & then I could play Qe6.  } Rf7 {Well I guessed right, but 20.Qe6  might have been better.  } 21. Qe6 {Pinning the Rook with the idea of Ng5} Nb4 {I was pleased to see this move.  It told me that Black was overconfident in his position & wanted to counter-attack my Queen-side.  Not until analysis did I see 21...Nd4 leading to   22.Qg4   Kh8 23.Nxd4  Qxd4 24.Qxd4  exd4  The material comes off, I'm up a Bishop & a pawn; but the win is far from clear.  } 22. Rab1 {Pinning his Knight & giving him trouble in hope that he will further commit to the Queen-side attack.} Qa5 {It worked.  Now when I play Ng5 & the Queen comes to c7 in defense, I can trade off.  So now my plan is...  Ng5  Qc7 Qxf7   Qxf7 Nxf7   Kxf7 Rxb4  I'll be up a Rook, Bishop, & a pawn.  The win might be several moves away, but it's clear.  I just force trades until I'm the only one who has material left.  } 23. Ng5 {Attacking the pinned Rook as planned.  } Raf8 {At this point alarm bells start ringing in my head.  Black is in trouble.  Both of his Rooks are attacked, 1 of them is pinned.  There might be a mating attack here, but I can't quite see it.  } 24. Nxf7 {I figure I'll take his Rook; let Black re-capture, pinning his other Rook.  Then maybe I can bring one of my Rooks into the attack.  } Nxc2 {Well I wanted to bring a Rook in, now I can do it with tempo.  Nxd6   Kh8 Rxe5} 25. Nxd6+ Kh8 26. Rxe5 {I could have played Qxe5 here & forced the trade of Queens, but I didn't want to.  If after Rxe5 Black brought the Queen home, then everything gets traded & I win the Endgame.  Black doesn't want to trade either.  So I figured he would grab my a pawn instead & threaten my back rank.  } Qxa2 {Black threatens mate in 1.  I had to know for certain when I played Rxe5 that Qxa2 wasn't a threat.  In fact, it leads to mate in 2.  Here mate in 2 beats mate in 1.  } 27. Qf6+ {Qf6 !  There are only 2 possible replies.  27...Kg8 followed by Qg7#.  Or         ...Rxf6 Re8   Rf8 Rxf8#} Rxf6 28. Re8+ {Here he resigns.  In this game I got to hold off mate in 1 for 2 moves, & Sacrifice my Queen to force mate.  A pretty ending & a fun game.  Hat's off to Jongraft, he gave me a hard time.  }
