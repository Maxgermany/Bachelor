1. e4 c5 2. c3 d6 3. d4 Nf6 4. f3 Nc6 {White's move of 4.f3 was rather strange, blocking out the square for the knight. } 5. Be3 Qb6 6. Qd2 e6 7. Bd3 Be7 {Black is now solidly developing the pieces out, and white has his center under some pressure. } 8. Ne2 O-O 9. O-O Rd8 {The purpose of this move is to give black a potentially useful move, while waiting for the opponent to make a decision. Perhaps the best move for white here is 10.Na3-c4, with a slight edge. Since black has not made any strange or questionable moves, he cannot be much worse.} 10. Qc2 {White makes a rather strange looking move now. Instead of developing, he places the queen again, to another square that is not necessarily better. When your opponent makes a questionable looking move, always understand what changes in the position because of it. Now black's activity will be faster, and he will have a chance to blast the center with extra time that white wasted with this move.} cxd4 11. Bf2 {White was afraid of 11.Nxd4 d5 probably, with threat to now play ...Bc5 or ...e5. This move still adds pressure to the black position. It looks very strange, placing another piece backwards, and losing control of the center, since the d4 pawn is no longer there. Therefore, black plays the best move.} d5 {Now black has at least equalized, with plenty of activity. } 12. exd5 Rxd5 13. Nxd4 Bc5 {Black's pieces are very active, while white's are a bit worse. Black should be better, but white's next sequence made me do strange moves that lost the advantage.} 14. Nxc6 Qxc6 15. Nd2 Bxf2+ {Releasing the pressure is the first inaccurate move. Black should keep the bishops in contact, since after the rook takes back, the 2nd rank is well defended.} 16. Rxf2 Qd7 {This is a real mistake that overlooks a white next move. } 17. Ne4 h6 18. Nxf6+ gxf6 19. Rd1 {Now black needs to stabilize the position and stop white from gaining a total control over the center. My defense over the next few moves are actually quite accurate, and my opponent loses his advantage quickly. Defense is much more difficult than offense, but I manage to do it. The key is to avoid all the concrete threats by the opponents, and taking any spare time the opponent allows you to get your position together.} b5 {Stops c4. } 20. Rfd2 Bb7 21. b3 {White plays too slowly, and allows black to get a slightly worse position.} Qc7 22. c4 bxc4 23. Bxc4 Rdd8 {This move is rather passive, but it does hold the center, which is what black has aimed for. Therefore, white has only a small advantage. My opponent, not wanting a draw, becomes rather frustrated with the fort not crumbling and loses most of his advantage. 24.Rd4! was strongest.} 24. Rd2xd8+ Rxd8 25. Rxd8+ Qxd8 {Black breathes a sigh of relief, and now starts with a more aggressive plan, to use my much superior endgame skills to outplay my opponent, who had an almost winning position at one point in the middlegame. The following was a wonderfully instructive grind as I improve my position while white clearly has no idea what to do.} 26. Qd3 Qa5 {Exhanging queens is suicide for my winning chances and probably would lose, due to the queenside majority white has, that will give him distant passed pawn. Besides, I am now playing to win. By the way, here is a rather advanced rule about the endgame that most players don't understand- Endgames, even those with equal material, are certainly not drawish, even if only 2 pieces are left. Some certainly are, but most are not. Most people would assume a draw here, which is totally wrong. If both sides play perfectly, a draw of course, but that is for any about equal position. Instead, both sides have appropraite ways to improve, and playing for a win is just as reasonable as in a typical middlegame position. Most players tend to think that equal endgames are draws. They are, but not easily at all! Any equal position is technically drawn with best play, but that requires both sides understand what they have to do. So I am playing to win here.} 27. Qe2 Kg7 28. a4 Qc3 {I will fix and neutralize my opponent's majority, then will use my king to support an advance of my first kingside f pawn, to fix the white weaknesses. Bd5 is a strong idea, tightening the pressure on white because taking gives me a passed pawn in a queens only endgame.} 29. Kf1 a5 30. Kf2 Bd5 31. Kg3 f5 {You see? Black has slowly improved the position, but white has no idea of what he needs to do. To tell the truth, it is not easy, so therefore white should stay put and cover some weaknesses the best he can. The key in the endgame is that the stronger side pushes the pawns, and the weaker side keeps the pawns at bay to cover weaknesses. The opponent does not understand this idea.} 32. h3 Kf6 33. Kf2 f4 {With his plan completed, black has gained a continuous edge due to the space advantage and weaknesses on the kingside. White seals a blunder that ends up losing the game.} 34. g3 {Terrible move. Now terrible weaknesses will be created. White is clearly worse, so he should not help the opponent by advancing pawns and worsening his position. Let black do the work to try and gain something.} Qd4+ 35. Kg2 fxg3 36. Kxg3 {??This move now loses the game by force by one tempo. The calculation is straightforward, but black needs to make sure he does not miscount the pawn steps. The key is the the a and h passed pawns will stop each other when one promotes, so the first one to do so wins.} Qg1+ 37. Qg2 Qxg2+ 38. Kxg2 Bxc4 39. bxc4 Ke5 40. Kg3 {A count shows that black wins by one turn.} Kd4 41. Kh4 Kxc4 42. Kh5 Kb4 43. Kxh6 Kxa4 {Black's move a5 clearly was useful. White now gives up.}
