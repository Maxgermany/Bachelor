1. d4 e6 2. e4 c5 3. Nf3 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {The Sicilan Narjof defence. I will leave the theory of this varation to others as I know very little about it. } 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Qf3 {I played this with the idea of Bf4 to follow} Nf6 7. Bf4 e5 8. Bg3 {Forced, but it has the advantage of putting preasure on e5} Bb4 {This is a very strong pin. } 9. Nf5 {Black can capture on c3 with a slightly better game for white. although after  9. ...Bxc3 10. Qxc3 Qxc3 11. bxc3 Nxe4 12.Nxg7 the position is unclear. } O-O 10. O-O-O d6 {Black should have played Bxc3 with equal chances.} 11. Nxg7 {This is an excellent move I am sure vicpine did not see. The point is that the Knight is immune on account of 11. ...Kxg7 12. Qxf6  Kxf6 13. Nd5  with a monster fork!} Qe7 12. Bh4 {Black can not avoid the loss of material.} Kxg7 13. Bxf6+ Qxf6 14. Qxf6+ Kxf6 15. Nd5+ Kg7 16. Nxb4 Rd8 17. Nd5 {This seals the centre and cramps blacks pieces.} Nc6 18. Nb6 Rb8 19. Bc4 Be6 20. c3 Na5 {Black can not take the bishop because he would have no way of defending d6 after the exchange.} 21. Bxe6 fxe6 {This gives black some counter chances in the centre} 22. h4 {so begins the pawn march on the king side. Black has nothing better to do than sit back and let white win. } Kf6 23. Rh3 {activating all the remaining forces into the game.} Ke7 24. Rhd3 {This ties black completely to the defense of d6. Allowing white to start a pawn march on the king side. } Nc6 25. g4 {grabs more space on the king side and further cramps blacks position. } Na7 {This knight is enroute to c8 where it can assist in the defense of d6} 26. Nc4 Nc8 27. g5 b5 {This an attempt to create some counter play against the knight. However, this bad because it drops a pawn} 28. Nxe5 {I grab another pawn exploiting the pin against the rook on e8} Rb6 {all of black's pieces are now tied to d6. } 29. g6 {creating a past outside pawn. } hxg6 30. Nxg6+ Kf6 31. Rg1 Rb7 32.
