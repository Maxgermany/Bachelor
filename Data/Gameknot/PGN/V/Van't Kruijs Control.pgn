[Opening "Van't Kruijs opening (A00)"]

1. e3 {The Van't Kruijs. Not a popular opening at high levels, but notable for its transpositional potential, and used famously on multiple occasions by Kasparov against the Fritz engine.} Nf6 {More popular are 1...e5 or 1...d5, but I was hoping for 2.c4 b6 and a reversed Nimzovitch-Larsen attack.} 2. a3 {With this second unusual move we stray further from the book and the usual transpositions. I think 2.b3, 2.c4, or 2.Nf3 are stronger and more straightforward.} g6 {I was already planning to fianchetto this bishop; it's an even more obvious choice now, with b4 in White's control.} 3. b4 {Again, I think 2.b3 is cleaner. This is certainly more aggressive, but I've already made it clear that I don't intend to seriously contest the b4 square right away. As of this move, we are entirely off-book (with one game in Gameknot's World database following this line for another couple of moves).} Bg7 4. Bb2 d6 {Releasing the queen's bishop and preparing for an eventual ...c5.} 5. Nc3 {Continuing to develop the queenside aggressively. I think 5.Nf3 or 5.c4 might be more in line with the attack White is preparing here; he could benefit from the assistance of the c-pawn.} Nbd7 {I think ...Nc6 or even ...Bg4 would be fine here, but I was wary of an early pawn push against my undeveloped queenside. I'll also need to expand eventually, so I put the Knight where it can see c5.} 6. d4 {Mildly restricting ...c5 for now, though I felt at the time like this weakened White's queenside unnecessarily. I'm going to get c5 eventually; I think a simple developing move might have been stronger for White.} O-O {I take a moment to collect myself in case all those pawns start pouring down the board. I'm also getting my King out of the way for when the position inevitably opens up.} 7. Nf3 {White starts mobilizing his kingside.} e6 {At the time, I was concerned about 7...c5 8.d5 e6 9.e4 and my resulting backwards pawn at d6, but I don't think it looks so bad now. 7...b6 followed by ...Bb7 before playing ...c5 would probably do better; this e6 pawn proves to haunt my position for a long time to come.} 8. Nd2 {I'm not sure of the purpose behind this move. White may be aiming for a Knight on e4 or c4, but either post is easily assailable, and exchanging one of his knights for my expendable one on f6 doesn't seem productive.} c5 {With the White Queen momentarily out of the picture, this is a good time to get off my back three ranks.} 9. dxc5 {The computer labels this an inaccuracy, and gives the continuation 9...Nd5 10. Ndb1 dxc5 11. b5 a6 12. Ra2 Nc7 13. bxa6 Nxa6, which certainly looks good for Black, with a significant developmental lead and good prospects against White's cramped position. The computer recommends 9.Be2 instead...} dxc5 {But I don't see the discovered pin on the Knight, and simply recapture.} 10. b5 {Risky but aggressive, and my Queenside is still looking pretty unprepared for a real attack. The computer thinks 10.Nc4 is better here (to protect against ...Nd5).} b6 {The computer is still obsessed with ...Nd5, but I'm not feeling that aggressive at this point in the game. I'm trying to clamp down on White's advanced position and get my Bishop into the action, but...} 11. Qf3 {...There goes my Bishop's only good square, and it's going to take some work to get him into play. This move also puts some pressure on my Knight on f6, threatening to open up a powerful discovered attack down the long diagonal.} Nd5 {Blocking the attack down the h1-a8 diagonal and preparing for ...Bb7. I open up my own pin first to keep White's Knight from trying anything tricky.} 12. Nde4 {The computer lists this as an inaccuracy, and I agree. While it doesn't lose material, this Knight push nets me a tempo after ...f5, which I can then use to play ...Bb7. I think the intention was to aim at d6 while defending the Knight on c3, but that piece is in no real danger (12.O-O-O Bxc3 13.Bxc3 Nxc3 14.Qxa8 Nxd1 15.Kxd1 leaves White in fine position).} f5 {Picking up a little space and gaining a tempo to play ...Bb7 after the Knight retreats.} 13. Nxd5 {?? This is simply an oversight. White doesn't have enough to threaten anything significant, and hangs a piece.} Bxb2 14. Ra2 Bg7 {I really wanted to keep my Bishop around and I was afraid of hanging my Rook if I got greedy and started taking more Knights right away. 14...exd5 is definitely better here.} 15. Nf4 {?? This is not the correct Knight to give me. White would get the pawn back anyway, but at least after 15.Nd2 Ne5 (not 15...exd4? 16.Qxd4+ Kh8 17.Qxa8) 16.Ne7+ Qxe7 17.Qxa8 Qc7 18.f4 Bd7 19.Qxf8+ Kxf8 20.fxe5 Qxe5 White has decent, if maybe not enough, compensation.} fxe4 {The material is nice, but now I have to keep an eye on my isolated, undefended e6 pawn.} 16. Qxe4 {The critical difference between this move and the line mentioned above: White takes back without check. But now he threatens e6 and my Rook at a8, so how am I to defend both?} Bc3+ {! Driving the King into the open.} 17. Ke2 {? 17.Kd1 looks ugly at first glance because of 17...Nd6+, but after 18.Qd3 there really isn't as much to worry about and White's King is a little safer than he is on e2.} Ne5 {This Knight finally gets into the fight, unleashing the Black Queen and defending the weak e6 pawn in the process. I've dealt with both of the White Queen's threats for now.} 18. Nd3 {The only move. If 18.Qxa8??, 18...Qd2#.} Bb7 {?? My thought process here was that after 18...Bb7 19.Qxb7 Ng4 20.Kd1 Nxf2 and I get the rook, then the bishop, and win easily. What I failed to notice is that the Knight doesn't actually check White's King from g4, so the King has no reason to move and my poor, patient Bishop dies for no good reason. 18...c4 would have been a much better choice.} 19. Qxb7 Ng4 {Steadfastly sticking to my plan, even though I realize at this point that I've given back a large portion of my advantage. I still threaten f2, and White's development is too far behind to defend it efficiently.} 20. f3 {Better than letting me take f2 with check.} Nxe3 {It's worth noting that I could still play ...c4 in here pretty much any time, but I want to consolidate my pieces first. White's King can't take my Knight here without exposing himself to a deadly attack from my Queen, Bishop and Rook.} 21. Qe4 {Black brings the Queen back to someplace useful and threatens to take the Knight and get his other pieces off the back rank.} Nf5 22. Kf2 {Trying to get out of the way of the light-square Bishop so White can get his last two pieces into play. Getting the King off the e file also threatens Qxe6+ without having to worry about a game-ending pin.} Kh8 {Getting out of the way of Qxe6+, and inviting White to take the pawn, confident that giving my rook the e file would be well worth the material.} 23. Be2 {White continues to work to consolidate his position, not taking the bait on e6. } Bd4+ {So I continue to do my best to keep the Rook from escaping its corner. The King has to retreat, and the Rook stays out of play for at least another two turns.} 24. Ke1 Qd6 {I'm comfortable enough with White's awkward position that I can spare the tempo to defend the e-pawn. With this move I transition from my earlier defensive posture into all-out prophylaxis mode; my goal now is to slowly tighten the noose until White is forced to give up something decisive. The computer suggests Nd6 instead, which opens up the position a bit, and is certainly playable.} 25. c4 {?! Freeing the Rook and reinforcing the queenside momentarily, but hanging a pawn in the process. I like 25.g3 or 25.f4 here instead, with an eye toward hiking the King over to c1 or b1 and freeing the h-Rook.} Ne3 {The Knight returns to this menacing outpost, forking g2 and c4. My Knight and Bishop are unassailable right now, and White would dearly love to be rid of them.} 26. g4 {I think 26.g3 is better here. There's no reason to overadvance the g-pawn; it makes f3 and f4 unnecessarily weak and doesn't accomplish anything that 26.g3 wouldn't. There are a few other options that provide a bit of counterplay for White, but I can't see anything better than g3.} Nxc4 {Picking up the free pawn. I considered leaving the Knight on e3 because it's just so strong there, or trying 26...Ng2+ and trying to drive the White King into a nasty discovered check or fork, but this seemed the most straightforward, and doesn't let White's Rook on h1 out.} 27. Nc1 {Threatening the Knight and pinning the Bishop momentarily. White's Knight is now in an ugly spot, but at least the Rook on a2 has a path out.} Bc3+ {Tossing in a check before I deal with the Knight, opening up the d-file and forcing the White King to f2 (if 28.Kf1?? Nd2+ 29.Rxd2 Bxd2 and Black wins easily).} 28. Kf2 {Forced, but at least it lets the h1 Rook out at last.} Nb2 {Moving the Knight out of harm's way and blocking White's other Rook from contributing.} 29. Nb3 {I think 29.Nd3 is better here. The Knight doesn't really have any prospects from b3. Alternatively, 29.h4 gives White some counterplay.} Rad8 {Piling on the d-file, but more importantly getting the Rook out of the Queen's sights and threatening ...Rf4.} 30. Kg2 {Getting out of the pin and away from my Knight and Bishop. Another option is 30.Rc1, which leads one way or another to some favorable exchanges for White.} c4 {At last, the long-awaited ...c4 appears. After 31.Bxc4 Rf4 32.Qc2 Rxc4 33.Rxb2 Qd5 34.Rbb1 Rf8 35.Qe2 Rxg4+ I'll end up in a very commanding position. } 31. Bxc4 Rf4 32. Qxe6 {? Not as strong as the line I gave in 30...c4. This move eliminates my position's biggest weakness (the pawn at e6 that's been hounding me all game), wins me the Bishop, and trades off White's most powerful piece.} Rxc4 {?! The computer lists this as a mistake, preferring to take with the Knight. I wanted to keep White's Rook and Knight locked away, but now my interlocked R/N/B trio is going to make my life difficult. 32...Nxc4 would maybe have been easier.} 33. Qxd6 Rxd6 34. Rc1 {Setting up an obnoxious pin on the Bishop, threatening Rxb2 or Rxc3.} Nd3 {At this point, I come out ahead in even exchanges, so after 35.Nd2 Rxg4+ 36.fxg4 Nxc1 37.Ne4 Nxa2 38.Nxd6 the resulting NB vs N game should be a solid, fun win for me.} 35. Rcc2 {? Not the exchange line I was hoping for, but this is a subtle mistake White couldn't afford to make.} Ne1+ {Forking the King and Rook.} 36. Kh3 {? The computer labels this a mistake, but I think White is already lost at this point.} Nxf3 {The pawn is more tempting than the Rook now. White's pieces are locked down pretty effectively and there's blood in the water.} 37. Nc1 {I think Ra1 is a little better at this point, to try to entice some trades and ease Black's pressure off.} Ng1+ {The beginning of the end. 38.Kg2 leads to mate in four and 38.Kh4 loses a Rook and Knight for my Bishop after 38...Be1+ 39.Rf2 Bxf2+ 40.Rxf2 Rxc1.} 38. Kg2 {But White heads for g2, letting me set up an elegant mate.} Rxg4+ 39. Kf2 {39.Kh1 holds out one extra turn.} Rf6+ 40. Ke3 Rf3# {And that's all there is. I hope you enjoyed it, and my thanks to cetst11 for a very good match! (I won't be annotating the other game in this match; I made some bad mistakes and he seized on them immediately, crushing me simply and quickly. A quick game, but not particularly interesting.) Comments and ratings are much appreciated!}
