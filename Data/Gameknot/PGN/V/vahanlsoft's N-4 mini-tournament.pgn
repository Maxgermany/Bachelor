1. e4 {Basic king pawn opening} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bb5 {i think this was called ruy lopes or so but i couldn't recall how it was countered} a6 {i played this move as i was remembering a situation where black draws his queen pawn away from the centre and gets the queen in the middle \unfortunately for me this is played if the second white knight is not developed} 5. Bxc6 dxc6 6. Nxe5 Qd4 7. Nf3 Nxe4 {this is not a blunder it's a crime :) i simply left my queen unprotected. Anyway it was the beginning of a torment for me so i decided to try and get at least a draw out of this} 8. Nxd4 Nf6 9. O-O Bg4 10. f3 {the check with the queen would have been better idea as it later turned out this was a disastrous move for white. And it basically is a poor move to play when you have castled king side} Bc5 {i was trying to play as aggressive as possible hoping for white to make a mistake as its not usual for white to play defense even when he had a queen and i didn't} 11. Nce2 Bd7 12. c3 O-O {castle is always a good idea when there is nothing better to be done and i didn't wanted to exchange pieces after all i was a queen down} 13. d3 Rfe8 {rook taking the open file something white should have done a long time ago } 14. b4 {trying to push back my bishop} Bb6 {getting it out of the harms way } 15. Kh1 {removing the pin on the knight on d4} a5 {offering a pawn exchange witch would lead to me having a rook on the 5th rank \which turned out to be extremely helpful\} 16. bxa5 Rxa5 {taking with the rook is better than with the bishop as it seizes the open 5th rank} 17. Bg5 {attacking the black knight but the bishop is unprotected} Rxg5 {taking some material back} 18. Nc2 Rge5 {doubling my rooks on the open e file} 19. Ng3 Nh5 {offering a knight exchange as it was more than obvious that my double rooks on the e file were not much of a help with the white queen in the near squares} 20. Nxh5 {accepting the knight exchange and i got my rook o the h file i was hoping to get my black square bishop on the h2 b9 diagonal anytime later in the game} Rxh5 21. Re1 {offering rook exchange and threatening mate if not played carefully by black \and taking the open file\} Ra8 {taking the other open file as i was obviously overpowered in the centre} 22. d4 {blocking my black squared bishop} Be6 {blocking the e file} 23. Nb4 c5 {forking the knight and the pawn if white accepts to trade pawns i was getting my black squared bishop out and i would be able to go and attack this weak h2 pawn} 24. d5 {trade not accepted attacking the bishop on e6} Bd7 {getting the bishop out of the harms way} 25. Nc2 {getting the knight out of the harms way} c4 {advancing the pawn and getting the bishop in the action again :) keeping the king in the corner of the board} 26. Re7 Ba4 {saving the bishop and pinning the white knight and later taking it :)} 27. Qe2 {removing the pin from the white knight and also trying to put more pressure on e8 \which could lead to mate if white succeeds in taking his second rook on e1} Bc5 {attacking the white rook \but more importantly leaving the c7 pawn unprotected hoping for white to get greedy for material\} 28. Rxc7 {he does get greedy for pawns :)} Bd6 {attacking the white rook but more importantly forking the white rook and the h2 pawn \and leaving an unprotected pawn on b2\} 29. Rxb7 {white is still greedy for pawns that's OK with me if i don't succeed in mating i wouldn't require many pawns as I'm still a queen down and i have no hope for a pawn endgame} Re8 {! important move taking the e file attacking the white queen} 30. Qf2 Bxh2 {taking a pawn back but more importantly threatening to move the bishop to g2 open a chess from the rook and take the queen} 31. Qf1 {white sees the threat and saves the queen but the white knight on c2 is no longer protected from the queen and my bishop still waits to capture it} Bd6+ {check} 32. Kg1 {getting the king out of the way} Bxc2 {taking the white knight first because it's a nice capture but more importantly because it was preventing me from playing the deadly for white Bc5+ move} 33. Qxc4 {I'm not sure if white was simply greedy for my pawn or foresaw the Bc5+ coming but anyway i still was in a good position \relatively good considering the missing queen and pawns\} Bd3 {the fun part begins :) Bd3 threatens white;s queen but though the bishop is not protected if captured this allows me to play bd5 check and if white does not block with the queen i go Ra1 and checkmate and second if not captured i was hoping to play Bh2+ hoping to mate with the 2 bishops} 34. Qc6 {bot captured but still preventing me from doing the Bc5+ anyway this is where white loses the game as he enters a forced mate and loses a pretty much won game I've no idea what white was trying to do \most probably take the e8 rook and checkmate me but it turned out as a mission impossible\} Bh2+ {if white goes 35 Kh1 Bf4+ 36 Kg1\forced\ Be3# game over!} 35. Kf2 {only choice hoping for me not to complete the forced mate} Re2+ 36. Kf1 {forced} Rc2+ 37. Ke1 {forced} Bg3+ 38. Kd1 {foced} Rh1# {Good Game! Congratulations!}
