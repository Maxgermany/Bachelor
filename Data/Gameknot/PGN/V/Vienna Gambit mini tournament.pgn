1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 exf4 4. Bc4 c6 5. d4 Bb4 6. Nge2 Nxe4 7. O-O Nxc3 8. bxc3 Be7 {The starting position for all the games. White is about to win back one of the two gambited Pawns. } 9. Nxf4 {The natural move.} d5 10. Bd3 {Obvious.} Bd7 11. a4 {A "just in case" move, to make sure Black doesn't get any Q-side ambitions.} a5 12. Qe2 {Pinning pieces is never a bad idea.} b6 13. c4 {Trying to open up more lines.} Be6 14. cxd5 {Undoubling my Pawns after the anticipated exchange.} Qd6 15. Bb2 {Well, if Black doesn't want to recapture...} cxd5 16. Bb5+ {Ah. Black just delayed it by a move. Anyway, may as well seize this diagonal.} Bd7 17. Rae1 {Adding force to the pin.} Bxb5 18. Qxb5+ {The clear choice. No way I'm closing the line by recapturing with the Pawn.} Nd7 19. Nxd5 {Bringing another piece into attack position.} O-O 20. Nxe7+ {I'm not about to pass on a free Bishop.} Kh8 21. Qg5 {May as well move the Q over towards Black's K.} f6 22. Qg4 {A tactical retreat.} f5 23. Nxf5 {Grabbing a loose Pawn. 23... Q-N3 was the expected reply, after which I intend to exchange Queens and win in the endgame. } Nf6 24. Qxg7# {On the other hand, an immediate mate is fine too.}
