1. d4 c5 {i like starting with the modern nimzovitch usually vs e4 players but vs d4 i like opening a temporary pawn gambit is this a good opening? and ill usually concentrate on a queen side attack for this openining.} 2. dxc5 e6 {follow through to develop bishop and take middle since i undermined his middle pawn} 3. b4 {i like players who reinforce like this makes for 3 moves without any developped pieces and far advanced pawns on the side i plan on attacking,} Nc6 4. a3 Nf6 5. Bb2 d5 {is offering the En passant a good idea to develop my black bishop?  and if he doesnt accept have a stronger middle?       (ive only got 4-10 games vs d4 players with c5 opening from me in my passed any advice is appreciated.} 6. cxd6 e.p. Bxd6 7. e3 O-O 8. Bb5 a5 {no that im adequately developped saving my WSB for later i start pushing my pawns queen side to go with what i wanted to do a queen side attack and start undermining those early moved pawns and open up lanes for rook on A file} 9. Bxc6 {i purposefully let him detach my pawns as i was planning on moving them on to clear the way anyway } bxc6 10. Nf3 Ba6 {here i played just a tad fast trying to prevent his Castle, didnt watch where his knight could or would go} 11. Nd4 {i didnt want to move my bishop from d6 cause i was planning on queen c7 bishop d5 or an assault on his rook since his horse is still not developped so he forces me to defend with bishop.      why i was saying i think my previous move was a bit too hasty. i was forced to move same piece twice} Bb7 12. Qf3 {i like this move from the queen i have a blind attack waiting with my bishop and it compliments my Qc7 move later.  i dont want to offer his b4 pawn a change towards the middle, id rather he eat a file and i develop rook. or i eat him with my pawn when the timing comes.   (anything wrong with that thinking?)  as for whats coming now i see hes planning a quick check mate with Queen and bishop when i unveil my WSB to attack his queen but i got time to get ready for it} axb4 {i do as planned. he didnt want to eat back and trade rooks. which i think wouldve been wiser for him long run.} 13. Nxc6 {this allows my Qc7 move} Qc7 14. Bxf6 {he tries to double pawn me but im not gonna open up my king to an easy check/checkmate situation} Bxc6 {gain time on queen but this i forsaw he would use to reposition his queen for the checkmate attack. since i had forseen his line and wasnt worried cause g6 saves me since he doesnt have enough material developped to attack} 15. Qg4 g6 {now hes forced to try and start developping more pieces. and my early planned attack for his rook is set and im going hard queen side.} 16. O-O Be5 {trade off bishops and now i start controlling momentum and hes forced to move defensively each time im happy with my game so far even though i havent made up for the pawn gambit yet. but its givin me so much development itll be hard for him to catch up} 17. Bxe5 Qxe5 18. Nd2 {took a while for me to analyse what i wanted to do here so plan was to race the pawn up trading rooks} Rxa3 19. Rxa3 bxa3 {very dangerous pawn alone on his lane 2 away from queening i got my WSB that i kept for later to protect an eventual a2 and my queen is nicely placed to protect a1} 20. Nb3 {i think he didnt have many moves at this time and wanted to open up his lane for his rook} Qb2 {bring my queen in. since his queen is on the other side of board} 21. Qc4 {here was a mistake by him lets me gain time by attacking his queen in retreat and covering my pieces and attacking his knight also} Bd5 22. Qb4 Rc8 {this was my second favorite move of the game i knew it would force his Rook to c1 and then i can just eat horse with bishop he cannot take with pawn or else rxc1 Checkmate} 23. Rc1 Bxb3 {bingo :D} 24. Rf1 {retreats rook hasnt had time to move a pawn yet to make it safer for his king} Bxc2 {start eating him up offer a queen exchange to promote pawn with the covering bishop on white square his is in big trouble now} 25. Qe1 {decides to put all his pieces on defense} a2 26. Qa1 {here i took a while to analyse and i came up with my favorite move. ill just Trade queens and Seal his rook in the corner and throw the key away lol} Qxa1 27. Rxa1 Bb1 {from here on out the war on the queen side was won and i had an extra rook to help the king side Pawn assault was a slow walk up to a checkmate my oponent stay the whole way i like those games hehe} 28. h3 h5 29. Kh2 Kg7 {my plan was just to wait for him at this stage and navigate my rook and king properly inbetween pawn moves} 30. g4 hxg4 31. hxg4 g5 32. Kg3 f6 33. f4 gxf4+ 34. Kxf4 Kg6 35. e4 {i love when oponents put pawns in front of kings late game ehehe in 1 rook scenarios} Rc4 36. Kf3 e5 37. Ke3 Rxe4+ 38. Kf3 Kg5 {ihis pawns are crumbling, its really spelling out the end now  im still loving to look at the board from his perspective and seeing 2 black pieces in the bottom left corner } 39. Kg3 Rxg4+ 40. Kf3 Rd4 41. Ke3 f5 42. Kf3 {once i had rook positioned on d4 he couldnt use king to help his rook anymore just have to watch out not to give him a draw} f4 43. Ke2 Kg4 44. Kf2 Rd3 45. Ke2 e4 46. Kf2 f3 47. Kf1 Kg3 {now he is mate in 2-4 depending on if he wants to waste 2 turns exchanging his rook out.  i hope people enjoyed the game and maybe offer better moves in instances where i made mistakes so i can refer to some of these lines in the future} 48. Ke1 e3 49. Kf1 Rd1# {}
