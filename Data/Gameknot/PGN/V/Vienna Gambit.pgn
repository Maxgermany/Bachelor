1. e4 e5 2. f4 Nc6 3. Nc3 exf4 4. Nf3 d6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. d4 g5 7. O-O Bg7 {To here, fairly standard lines for a Vienna gambit game.} 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 9. b3 Qe7 {Preparing for O-O-O, but why?} 10. Re1 O-O-O 11. Bb2 Bd7 {Brings pressure to the King-side, but removes any threat to the KP.} 12. Qd2 {Basic development, but crucial.} g4 {The knight is unguarded, with no retreat square - but this loses the game or the Queen.} 13. Nd5 Qf8 {Possibly the worst option, as the Queen is un-developed.  But the game is gone anyway.  Necessary was b6 or Bc6.} 14. Qa5 {Black has nothing left but garbage moves: mate on either c7 or a8 within 3.} b6 15. Qxa7 Bxd4+ 16. Bxd4 gxf3 {Well, he did take the knight.} 17. Qxc7# {}
