1. d4 e6 2. e4 c5 3. Nf3 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Be2 Bb4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 {Based on my experience in this tournament I can not see the exchange benefits black in the long run. White has the bishop pair and strong diagonals to compensate for the pawn. } Nxe4 10. Bb4 Qb6 11. c3 e5 {This is the little premature. Better is 11. ...Nc6.} 12. f3 exd4 13. fxe4 {here black is slightly better because of all the pawn weaknesses in whites position. } dxc3 {As black I would prefer to develop my pieces with 13. ...Nc6. } 14. bxc3 {Why bxc3 instead of Bxc3? Well because the bishop on b4 prevents black from castling. } Qe3 {This is a good move by Dcrofut which I did not see coming. } 15. Qd3 Qxd3 16. Bxd3 {With the queens gone my bishops dominate the board. } b5 {a good move that restricts the mobility of the bishop} 17. Bd6 {This ensures that the king stays in the centre. Black is ok because white has two pawn weaknesses. } Nc6 18. e5 {This prevents Ne5 which is good for black. } f6 {Bad move! This allows me to create an open file right in from of the King. Better is Bb7 taking control of the long diagonal. } 19. exf6 gxf6 20. O-O Kf7 {This tries to defend f6. } 21. Rf2 {preparing to double up the rooks on the the F file. } h5 {opening up access to h6 for the rook. } 22. Raf1 Ke8 {Black had to try Rh6. } 23. Bg6+ {it is mate in 4. } Kd8 24. Rf2xf6 Bb7 {}
