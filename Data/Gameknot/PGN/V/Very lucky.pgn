1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. d5 {An answer I almost never meet, but it makes sense, totally. } Bb4+ {I don't want to play the fianchetto, but it was probably the best option. If Bc5, d3 and later my dsb will be kicked and in troubles, so I decided to exchange it at once, and be strong on the white squares, via f5. } 4. Bd2 {Thank you...} Bxd2+ 5. Qxd2 {Not good, but I can't say it is bad, either. I like the queen to be "looking" at b3 or a4(+), but true is that now the threat has less strenght. Interesting is 6. c5!? causing problems to black's developement. } d6 {I should have played Ne5 at once, get the tempo over the queen, and support the kinght with the bishop. White has Qb4 (to prevent my bishop to develop), I's play Ka6... but I dicided to ensure my developement line before trhowing the kinght up there. } 6. Nc3 Bf5 7. f3 {with my knight in e4, this would have been a mistake from white: Qh4+, followed by Nxg3 was very annoying for white. } e4 {I didn't want to wait for e4, and I had my bishop there for some reason, so I played this one. } 8. fxe4 Bxe4 {The idea was that my opponent would not have resisted to take the bishop, and leave my knight in the "pole position" for a Qh4+ attack. The knight can easily be defended by the f pawn, while white has no pawn to kick it. But my opponent didn't fall into it. } 9. Qe3 {Very smart. My only defence is...} Qe7 10. Nf3 {Catching up in developement, but still the white's lsb is trapped. I have some move to settle. } O-O {I can leave the queen unprotected now. } 11. g3 {Manouvering to get the lsb active. The Qh4 plan is meaninglessnow, but I still welcome the exchange, so time to develop. } Nbd7 {Unfortunately, due to the bishop this knight can't go to e5 right now. On c5 it will help just for one move, since after b4 it has to go away. } 12. Bg2 Nc5 {...This was a mistake. I should have gone Ra-e8, or a5. } 13. O-O Rfe8 {I sensed it was difficult to use the f column, so I got this one in place. As you can see, I should have taken advantage from my opponent's move to play a5, but I somehow missed it. } 14. b4 {Here it comes. } Bxf3 {I don't know if this is the best, but when in doubt, cramped and attacked, a safe exchange is a good advice. } 15. Qxf3 {White, cleverly, doesn't want to exchange. Here black has Qe3+, but I missed it. } Ncd7 {You can't say black had a good outcome from the opening. I have to improve this. } 16. e4 {Of course. Black is now severely restricted. } Ne5 17. Qe2 Nfg4 {Silly move. I wanted to get some squares for my other pieces. } 18. Rf4 {I was waiting for h3, kicking the knight (to h6), and maybe have some weakeness in white's castling. I would have to compromise mine too, though. } Nh6 19. Raf1 f5 {?! Passive defence would fail in the long term. I'm not testing my opponent's technique, I just want to have fun. Let's see what happens. White doesn't have to take. He can play Bh3, but he preferred...} 20. exf5 {Here, a good way to exchange queens and release some pressure was to play Ng6. If white takes the knight, QxQ and then RxN, and it doesn't matter g6xh7+, Kxh7. If white QxQ, NxQ saving it from the capture. After this, probably f6 by white was decisive. But I just saw that the knight cannot move. Here, the right move for black was... Qf6. It blocks the pawn, and threats a double threat over the white queen AND the c3 knight by removing the knight. } Ref8 {I was scared of f6 and played this instead. I forgot the knight's jump, it will stay there until necessary. } 21. Bh3 {Of course, and good. still, Qf6 and Nf7 was possible. } Qg5 {I thought that now white can't kick the queen with h4, so I played this move.} 22. f6 gxf6 {Ok, I know, my king is wide open. But we have no black bishop's on the board, so I have a hope. The other knight could have come into action now, Ne4, and things would have been even worse for black.  } 23. Be6+ {That's ok. } Kh8 {This is the safe square for my king...} 24. Ne4 {I'm really squeezed and doomed. } Qg7 25. Nxf6 {Incredibly, white, with all this penetration, has no easy way to the win. } a5 {I can't move. Nf7 would have been the only one, but I wanted to take a minimum of a chance of getting the other rook on play, because with the two minor pieces placed like that it was limited to useless squares. } 26. b5 {Wisely, white doesn't fall into it, and makes for me impossible to grab the column. If a4, a3! and the rook can't escape. } b6 {well, let's block it completely, then. White is the owner of the white squares, but the "hot" ones are black! (f8, c7, f6... and the rest of the black pieces!} 27. Rf1f2 {Probably with the intention of adding the queen to the f pressure. } Nhf7 {The only sensible move I can figure.} 28. Qh5 {Gasp! My, I feel like Hitles in his last days. :-). Here, h6 saved the day for some more move, but I could do nothing against Kh1-g4-g5. White is playing preparing for a knight's jump. It forces me to save my own knight of f7. If I go something like h6, white can play Ne8. I can take it, but then white will take mine on f7, and with a rook there, I'm doomed.   It's interesting to try to find an escape (28...h6, 29. Ne8, Qg6, 30. QxQ, NxQ, 31. RxNf7, RxR, 32, RxRf7). But in attacking this way, white omits a black's move...} Nd3 {Now, black has a change to win an exchange. But I played this without seeing the deadly, simple Rg4. My queen is doomed, but it is still interesting to see how the game could have proceeded. (In my lines, black can't survive this one). But white couldn't see the move at the moment, and got a "brilliant" idea. } 29. Qxh7+ {It would have done more sense Nxh7. Now, the storm begins, it's crisis time. } Qxh7 {Forced. } 30. Nxh7 {White can't allow the black queen to survive. } Nxf4 {I take the most valuable piece first, and the one that blocks the other's action. My knight threats Nh3+, winning the other rook, so thie has to take it. } 31. Rxf4 {Now, it's a knight for a knight. And I had the exchange. White threw 90% of his advantage for missing a decisive move. I played very bad until now, but maybe I can still save this. } Kxh7 32. Rxf7+ Rxf7 33. Bxf7 Rf8 {Caging the white king, and feeling completely free to leave my pawns unguarded. My opponent has two joined pawn, and this should give him advantage. I doubt I can stop the two of them, so I am technically lost (I can be wrong, be aware!). But now white better play with good technique, or the weakness of his own pawns against the rook will cause his  to lose the game. White's bishop belongs to b3. Period. White can still try to bring the king on his pawn's side, losing the other two at the end, and force a draw, but it requires very good chess either. } 34. Be6 {?? It seems obvious, but this is the losing move for white, since now his pawns are doomed, and the game lost! Can you believe it? It is not a "quiet" endgame, at all! With 34. Bb5 white could still have had the bishop in d1 - caring of the rook's forks... but now, I knew I had won this game. } Rf3 35. a4 {Still without seeing the point of it. } Ra3 {Or Rc3, but look: the way to the 8th rank doesn't cross for any square easily reacheable by the white bishop. Death is just some moves away. } 36. Bd7 {A complete waste of time. White had to push his other pawns, just hopelessly. } Rxa4 {? I give him another tempo. } 37. h4 Rxc4 38. g4 a4 39. Bf5+ {Ok, so here I just have to push the pawn. If Bb1, Rc1+ forking it and goodbye. BUT white checked me, so...} Kg7 40. Kf2 {Allowing Bb1, but after Rc1 anyway...} a3 41. Bb1 Rc2+ {...and now this little brilliancy, just to be cruel. } 42. Ke3 a2 {Taking advantage from the situation until its last consequences. } 43. Bxa2 Rxa2 44. Kf4 Rb2 {I have to sac my rook for the two pawns and be sure my pawn will queen. This pawn is farther than the d one, but taking the latter would have got my rook into the action faster. } 45. Kf5 {Rf2+, and etcetera. No, let's try. } Rxb5 46. Ke6 Rb4 {He has to retreat or lose the pawns. } 47. g5 {?? Second worst move of the game. } Rxh4 48. Kd7 Rc4 {Now it's over. It was a bad but interesting game, as often :-)} 49. Ke6 b5 {}
