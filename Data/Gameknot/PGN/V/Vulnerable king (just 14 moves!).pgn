1. e4 {the game displays the benefits of early development and the supremacy of active pieces the game was played under time limits which resulted in some bad moves that made possible this fine attacking game :)} e5 {kings pawn game(evergreen opening ), the most  common opening but a good one too} 2. Nf3 Qf6 {greco defense the black queen aims for the f2 pawn and his intentions become quite clear in the coming moves when the dark square bishop is also applied to this diagonal} 3. Bc4 {i too am aiming for the same thing, f7, the counterpart of f2 on black's king side :)} Bc5 {trying to hold an important diagonal which can be dangerous once i am castled } 4. Nc3 {developing my pieces } c6 {providing a base to place the d7 pawn at d5 to scare my bishop away} 5. d4 {blocking the diagonal for the black's bishop} exd4 6. Bg5 {one important point in chess is quick development, i am mobilizing my pieces and at the same time pushing black to waste his moves by moving his queen this is one disadvantage of early queen out} Qg6 7. Ne2 {the obvious retreat coz i can't take the pawn but now i've three forces on the pawn } h6 {pushing the bishop backwards} 8. Bf4 Qxg2 {Qxg2 !? the move apparantly sounds good coz i've both my rook and the knight at f3 under black queen's attack, my king side is ruined i am about to lose a piece but at the same time opens a line for my rook i had to lose a piece anyway so i tried to balance it by taking a pawn and at the same time depriving black off castling} 9. Bxf7+ Kxf7 {the black king is exposed now and i can now use my active pieces and the open line for the rook more affectively} 10. Ne5+ Ke6 11. Rg1 Qxe4 {capturing another pawn and taking a lead of  5 points i must attack or i'll lose in the long run} 12. Rg6+ Kd5 {the black must be confused or probably relaxed coz it doesn't make any sense to keep moving your king against the enemy lines the consequences are too devastative} 13. f3 Qf5 {the only square left for the queen  i am still a piece and two pawns down but all of my pieces are active while the black's pieces are resting in their squares, so its not just the pieces that matter, its the ACTIVE pieces that matter! } 14. Nc3# {black checkmated :) though the game is only 14 moves but still it could have been finished at 13th move which i missed at that time but it occured to me later, many of you might've noticed at the spot that at move 13, instead of f3, c4 is checkmate right away!}
