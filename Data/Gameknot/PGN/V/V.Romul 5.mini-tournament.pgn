1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 {I have been asked to annotate this for a friend, so here goes.} 4. Bf4 {It starts as a fairly conventional Slav Defence. 4. Nc3 is more common that 4. Bf4, but Bf4 can hardly be bad.} e6 {This can hardly be wrong, but 4....Bf5 is more active. As played the Bc8 becomes a very bad bishop, hemmed in by its own pawns.} 5. e3 {This seems good, allowing the Bf1 to recapture on c4 if necessary.} Nbd7 {Solid development again.} 6. Nc3 {The knight finally goes to its natural square.} Qb6 {And the black queen comes out to menace b2. } 7. Qb3 {Post Match Computer Analysis(PMCA) gives this as a mistake, and says the position is now level. It prefers 7. Qc2 with an advantage of 0.57 to white. I am not sure. Although white now ends up with doubled b pawns he has compensation with pressure down the a file. Incidentally I have found this position on the opening databases, and both the games continued with  7. b3?? Bb4 and black soon won a knight and later the game.} Qxb3 8. axb3 {So the queens come off, but the only pieces to have been exchanged.} Bb4 {This pins comes in again, white has to be careful.} 9. Bd3 {Wisely stopping the knight from coming in to e4.} h6 {Not sure that this helps black that much. c5 looks a rather thematic move to me, or trying to get in e6-e5.} 10. Ke2 {White wisely connects rooks.} O-O {And black puts his king to a safer place.} 11. Ra4 {Hitting the bishop.} Be7 {Not given as a mistake by PMCA, but I prefer c5 or even a5, keeping the bishop active. Black is now a bit passive.} 12. Rha1 {and white has pressure on a7.} a6 {And this is virtually the only way to save the a pawn.} 13. c5 {Further cramping down on black's queen side.} Re8 {Presumably with the long-term plan of eventually freeing his position a little with e6-e5} 14. b4 {Preparing to get rid of the doubled pawn with b4-b5} b5 {Black stops that, but now his a6 pawn is very weak. His Ra8 and Bc8 are tied to protecting it. White has an advantage. PMCA says advantage of 0.57} 15. Ra4a2 {The rook was attacked.} Bb7 {This bishop is almost like a pawn now.} 16. h3 {Presumably to give the bishop f4 a flight square. Look how it is outside the pawn chain, so although it is on the same colour square as its pawns, so technically a "bad bishop" it is actually reasonable. While the Bb7 really is a bad bishop. } Rec8 {Presumably with a plan of Bd8-c7 to exchange off bishops, but I think black would be best advised to try and get in e6-e5, perhaps by Nh5 followed by Bf6.} 17. Nd2 {White comes up with an excellent plan to crank up the pressure.} Bd8 {Black continues with his plan.} 18. Nb3 {But now realises that if he continues with this plan, then Nb3-a5 will mean the exchange of the Bb7 and the fall of the pawn on a6. However, what else is black to do?} Kf8 {So the king comes over.} 19. Na5 {The knight goes in.} Bxa5 {The knight comes off. } 20. Ra2xa5 {White could have un-doubled his pawns by recapturing with the pawn, but he correctly realises that it is better to keep the pressure on the a file.} Ke8 {King comes over again, but it is largely a passive strategy.} 21. Ra5a3 {This moves seems weak too. What is it trying to achieve. I think white would have been better starting the plan he embarks on with his next move.} Kf8 {Black is just marking time. As I said, black should be trying to plan for a e6-e5 break sometime.} 22. Nb1 {Excellent move! White has a plan to break the dead-lock.} Rce8 {Black improves the position of his rook.} 23. Nd2 {White carries on with his plan.} e5 {At last e6-e5 comes in.} 24. dxe5 {So white takes.} Nxe5 {Black takes back.} 25. Bxe5 {White wisely exchanges black's best piece. } Rxe5 {Rook takes back.} 26. Nb3 {I think this is a good plan, but I prefer going via f3 rather than b3, in order to attack Re5 en route.} Re7 {PMCA says this is a mistake and prefers  Ra7 27. Nd4 Nh5 28. g4 Nf4+ 29. Kf3 Nxd3 30. Rxd3 g6 31. Kf4 Re4+ 32. Kg3 Kg7 33. f3 Re8 34. Kf4 g5+ 35. Kg3 Kf6 an advantage of only 0.18 to white.} 27. Nd4 {This is a mistake, white could have played 27. Na5! with an advantage of 1.51. As played black could have organised a defence.} Nd7 {But black misses his chance! 27....g7-g6 would have kept the Nd4 out of f5 and there is still a chance for black.} 28. Nf5 {Now the knight reaches d6 with devastating results. } Ree8 {As good as anything.} 29. Nd6 {Knight comes in, forking Re8 and Bb7.} Reb8 {This reduces the forthcoming material loss to just one pawn. } 30. f4 {Before exchanging and winning the pawn, white improves the position of his pieces.} Nf6 {Knight comes out.} 31. Kf3 {King goes up} Ne8 {Black threatens to exchange the Nd6.} 32. Nxb7 {And white finally cashes in.} Rxb7 33. Ra3xa6 Rxa6 34. Rxa6 Rc7 {White has won a pawn, and black is still passive. Having said that white's extra pawn is doubled, so there is still some work to do. } 35. e4 {White hopes black will exchange on e4.} Nf6 {Black wisely doesn't} 36. e5 {White advances again.} Nd7 {and the knight drops back.} 37. Ra8+ {White throws in a check} Ke7 {More or less forced.} 38. Rg8 {and now white attacks on the king side too.} g6 {Black saves the pawn.} 39. Bxg6 {But white comes up with this bishop sacrifice, leaving white with four connected passed unstopable king side pawns.} fxg6 40. Rxg6 h5 41. Rh6 {Black now needs to counter-attack with Ra7, but is still in defensive mode.} Rc8 42. Rxh5 Rf8 43. Ke3 {Presumably Ke3 is to break the pin on the f file.} Rf7 {Black misses his last chance for activity with Ra8. } 44. Rh6 {Not sure this achieves much - white just needs to advance his pawns.} Nb8 {This doesn't achieve much.} 45. Rd6 {White wastes another move, just advancing with g2-g4 is better.} Rg7 {Black attacks.} 46. Kf3 {White correctly protects with the king. g2-g4 would have been met with Rg7-h7 and the h pawn is dropping and black has chances again.} Rf7 {Perhaps hoping for a repetition.} 47. g4 {At last!} Nd7 {Knight comes back.} 48. e6 {Only to be lost.} Rf8 {Better to lose the knight rather than the rook. } 49. exd7 {The knight goes.} Rd8 {Black blocks the pawn.} 50. f5 {But the other pawns can't be stopped. } Kf7 {King comes across. } 51. g5 {And now black finally resigned.
