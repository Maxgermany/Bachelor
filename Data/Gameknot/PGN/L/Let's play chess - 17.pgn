1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 {...b6 and ...d5 are the normal moves here.} 4. Nc3 d6 {Into uncharted territory!} 5. e4 Be7 6. Bd3 Nbd7 7. O-O e5 8. d5 c5 {Black should not commit himself so early. He may want to put a knight on c5.} 9. a3 {Launching a K-side attack with Nh5 and f4 might prove more fruitful.} O-O 10. b4 a6 {?} 11. Bb2 {The bishop would probably be more useful on e3, but you'd have to prepare it by playing h3 first.} Re8 {? Black doesn't seem to have a clear plan. He needs to generate counterplay on the K-side by playing ...Nh5 and ...f5.} 12. Na4 Nb6 {?} 13. bxc5 Nxa4 14. Qxa4 Bd7 15. Qc2 h6 16. cxd6 Bxd6 17. Rfc1 Bc5 18. Bxe5 Bg4 19.

Bg4 {The bishop is better on g2, supporting the e4 pawn.} Kg7 33. Be6 f5 34. f4 {? exf5 wins another pawn!} Rxe4 35. Ree2 {? 35.Rxe4 fxe4 36.Re2 and White still has winning chances.} Rxe2 36.
