1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. fxe5 Nxe4 5. d3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 d4 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. cxd4 Nxd4 9. c3 {All mainline up to here, even though ... Nxd4 is not the best move, according to "The Complete Vienna" by Tseitlin and Glazkov.  That book recommends ...Bb4+, which is much more disruptive.  This is just slightly better for White here.} Nc6 {This move is just fundamentally wrong.  Even if Black didn't particularly like it, he had to play ...Nxf3, since retreating into the path of the mobile center pawns is such a dismal option.  That Knight will have no future after d4.} 10. d4 Bg4 {Also wrong... Here, he just needed to play Be7 and get out of the center quickly.  By playing ...Bg4, he alerted me to a common theme in King Pawn openings... the Bc4-f7, Ng5+ (or Ne5+, depending) tactic to take advantage of an unprotected Bishop on g4.} 11. Bc4 Be7 {It looks as if he's finally trying to castle and, once he does that, we'll only have a moderately better game for White.  Let's go for more by keeping him in the center!  This next move only took a bit of calculation, since it was mainly an intuitive sacrifice.} 12. Bxf7+ Kxf7 13. Ng5+ {It's easier to see the compensation for the sacrifice after the Knight moves.  Basically, the motivation was:  1.  Eliminate light squared bishop to weaken his light squares. 2.  Bring rook to open f file. 3.  Use advanced center pawns and develop quicker than opponent.  Being down a piece in this position is a decision that I think just about anyone would make.  :-)} Bxg5 14. Qxg4 Bxc1 {Losing.  There's not really a safe move here... but, moving the Bishop anywhere but taking on c1 would've put up more of a struggle.  After I castle, he's stuck in a mating attack.} 15. O-O+ Ke7 {On ...Ke8, the response would've been the same, threatening mate and rook.  Naturally, Kg8 fails to Qe6 mate.} 16. Qxg7+ Ke8 {Resigned, since Qf7 is mate.}
