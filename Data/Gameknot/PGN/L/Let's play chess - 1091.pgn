1. e4 e5 {I liked this game, because it proves the importance of a Pin*.. and how it may change the whole game around if its neglected...   *A pin is a situation in which a piece is forced to stay put because moving it would expose a more valuable piece behind it to capture.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Bc5 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg4 6. Nbd2 Qe7 7. h3 Bh5 8. g4 Bg6 9. Nc4 f6 10. g5 O-O-O {We got to this position (im playing black), and he's challenging my pawn at f6.. which I cant move cus its defending the one on e5... and if he were to put a knight there i'd be in big trouble since I'd have no pawns to shoo it away with.} 11. gxf6 {So he takes the pawn.. My initial instinct told me to take it back with my knight to develop my pieces, but then my pawn at e5 would fall... so I must do gxe5 instead. ... But then I noticed his pawn at e4 is actually not protected since I got its defender pinned to his queen with my rook!  } Nxf6 {I choose you, knight!} 12. Ncxe5 {He takes the pawn... so now I have to decide if I take his pawn at e4 with my rook or with my bishop?  Use Bishop: If I use bishop, I can then pin his knight at f3...   Use Knight: I can start an attack on f2, the king's weak spot, since my black bishop is also aiming over there... The problem is that he can then take my white bishop with his knight, but after a few calculations I noticed I had nothing to fear: I can just take it back and still have a very powerful discovered check  (Discovered checks are a lot more devastating if done with a knight IMO)} Nxe4 {knight! I choose you!} 13. Bg5 {here he messed up... I guess the shock of the pin and seeing my queen and rook all aligned there made him rush to make this move..} Nxg5 {CHOMP! now he's in big trouble, since Im threatening to munch on his knight at f3 and the one on e5 cant defend it cus of his king*   *kids! never leave your king in the center!} 14. Nxg5 {oh? another mistake... now I can take both of them cus I got check...} Qxe5+ {CHECK!} 15. Ne4 {now his knight is protected.... or is it?} Bxe4 {NEVAHR! that pawn at d3 is pinned, same mistake he did before...} 16. Qe2 {uh oh..  now my bishop is pinned... I cant take his rook with it since he would take my queen afterwards... Im not really concerned by this tho, i'd still be up one piece, I need a way to keep the attack going..} Bb4+ {I go for this check here...  He has 3 options: - kf1, which would be followed by Qxb2...and I end up taking one of his rooks.. - Kd1, which results in his pawn at d3 being pinned again, so I can just move my queen and keep the 2 piece advantage...   or...} 17. c3 {this...  SEKRUT STRATEGIEZ: a cool psyche trick you can do in gameknot when you've studied the position, is to do conditional moves... (the link is on the bottom when you're playing a game).  Not a lot of players use these, and it can throw your enemies off balance... and it will speed things up too! } Bxc3+ 18. bxc3 Qxc3+ 19. Qd2 Qxa1+ {which results in me forking his king and rook and eatings it... and notice his pawn at d3 is STILL pinned, so he cant take my bishop at e4...} 20. Qd1 Qxd1+ 21. Kxd1 Bxh1 22. f4 Rxd3+ {I trade all pieces to finish him off in the end game..  nothing too fancy there...} 23. Ke2 Rxh3 24. f5 Re8+ 25. Kd2 {}
