1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d6 4. d4 h6 {a bit of a lapse here.  4 ... g5 of course is the move.} 5. Bxf4 g5 {nothing to do now but play some chess and see if I can hold on.} 6. Bg3 Bg7 7. Bc4 Ne7 8. e5 {this strikes me as a little premature.  8 0-0 looks good.} d5 9. Bb3 O-O 10. h4 Nf5 {black had better be aggressive.} 11. Bf2 g4 12. Nh2 {this really strikes one as an oversight.  but is it?  12 Nfd2 g3 13 Bg1 Nxh4 may not be appealing for white.} g3 {better grab that piece} 13. Bg1 gxh2 14. Bf2 Be6 15. Nd2 c5 {the main thinking here was to eliminate that pawn on e5.} 16. Rxh2 cxd4 17. g4 Ne3 {in playing this move black had to be willing to have the queens come off the board and gradually try to realize his material advantage.} 18. Bxe3 dxe3 19. Nf3 Bxg4 20. Qe2 {20 Bxd5 Nc6 should win for black.} Nc6 {bringing up a key reserve.} 21. O-O-O Nxe5 22. Bxd5 Qf6 {a strong shot deciding the game} 23. Rf1 Nxf3 24. Rhh1 Qxb2+ 25. Kd1 Qb1# {}
