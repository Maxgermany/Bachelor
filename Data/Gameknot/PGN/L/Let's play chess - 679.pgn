1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 {I'm not familiar with 2. Bf4 but a look through Wikipedia Chess led me to the London System. I'm not sure if this accurately depicts the development of this game or not.} e6 3. Nc3 {3. Nc3 eliminates the possibility of the Queen's Gambit so I was making moves on my own early in this one.} Bb4 4. e3 Ne4 {I wanted to take advantage of the pin right away although this is a second move with my Knight when my Queenside pieces are still all locked up} 5. Nge2 {A nice developmental move that also protects the pinned piece} Nc6 6. a3 Ba5 7. b4 Nxb4 {7. ... Bb6 is the safe move here but I thought with White's Bishop blocked momentarily and my strong Knight on e4 I could force a favorable exchange or even a quick Mate if I could get my Queen into the attack. I also enjoy playing a true sacrifice now and again!} 8. axb4 Bxb4 9. Qd3 {Also possible is 9. Qd2 but the Knight must be reinforced against 9. ... Nxc3 followed by a discovered check} Nxc3 {I might have been better served by 9. ... d5 keeping the pressure on the c3 square. If I could have managed to fianchetto my light squared Bishop to b7 before White can do the same at g2 I think this game would have been mine but I'm always a move too slow. 10. g3 b6 11. Bg2 with an eventual Castle relieving the pressure on the King} 10. Nxc3 a5 11. Be2 {White must relieve the pin} b6 {I can now get my light squared Bishop on the b7-h1 diagonal which looks powerful} 12. O-O Ba6 {The game continuation suggess 12. Bb7 would have been better but it took some sharp play from White to avoid disaster} 13. Nb5 {The key to this move is the game continuation that I have yet to castle thus making 14. Nc7+ a very nice zwischenzug move} c6 {13. ... 0-0 14. Nxc7 Ra7 15. Nxa6 is disastrous for Black } 14. Nc7+ Qxc7 {This was the only solution I could find that relieved the pressure although the trading of pieces after my sacrifice bodes ill for me} 15. Bxc7 Bxd3 16. Bxd3 b5 {After the smoke clears I've got two pawns for a Bishop and a lack of development. Far from the compensation I need.} 17. Bg3 O-O 18. f4 f5 {My pawns are my only hope and I need to get them forward in a coordinated fashion} 19. e4 Bc3 {This netted me another pawn and gave me some hope} 20. Ra2 Bxd4+ 21. Kh1 fxe4 22. Bxe4 {Three pawns do not make a Bishop pair.} e5 23. f5 {23. fxe5?? Rxf1#} g6 24. Bd3 gxf5 25. Bxf5 {My hope was to get a back rank mate somewhere along the line but my opponent is too cagy for that} d5 26. Rf3 e4 {I'm now hoping to trap the light squared Bishop behind my pawn wall so that I can move forward down the Queenside} 27. Rf1 a4 28. Bd6 {This is a strong move although at the time I thought winning for Black. The only place to safely retreat the Rook is along the 8th rank which relieves the pin on White's light squared Bishop and ends Blacks hopes. After much thought I went with the game continuation thinking that I could push an unstoppable pawn.} Rxf5 29. Rxf5 e3 30. Rf1 e2 {This is a mistake not seeing the game continuation. I think better is 30. ... Bc3 31. Ra3 d4 32. Bc5 e2 33. Rxc3 dxc3 34. Re1 a3 and winning for Black. This is not forced and there are other choices. } 31. Re1 Re8 32. c3 {This is the move I missed in my analysis. Now 32. ... Bf2 winning the Rook is not possible as 33. Rexe2} Bxc3 33. Rexe2 Rxe2 34. Rxe2 {Now I'm down a Rook for three pawns although there is still hope} d4 35. Rc2 b4 36. Bxb4 {I'm not sure if this was an error or simply fear of the wall of passed pawns on the Queenside. I think white is better bringing the King into play and snapping up pawns but there are a lot of different lines} Bxb4 37. Rxc6 {Now my a-pawn pawn Queens on dark squares and I'm feeling like I might get a draw} a3 38. Rc4 a2 {This move costs me the game. Much better is 38. ... Bc3 39. Ra4 Bb2 40. Kg1 d3 41. Kf1 d2 42. Ke2 Bc1 which leaves me the King and one pawn on the Kingside against White's two pawns. There are a lot of lines but I think it is at least a draw for Black.} 39. Rc8+ Kf7 40. Ra8 a1=Q+ 41. Rxa1 d3 42. Rd1 d2 43. Kg1 Kf6 44. Kf2 Kf5 45. Ke3 h5 46. Rxd2 {Black now wins with Opposition although I test to make sure he knows how to do it} Bxd2+ 47. Kxd2 Ke4 48. Ke2 h4 49. g3 hxg3 50. hxg3 Ke5 51. Kf3 Ke6 52. Kg4 Kf7 53. Kf5 Kg7 54. g4 {Here White has proven to me he understands Opposition and I resign. I thought this was an excellent game with opportunities for both sides and some very sharp play. A better end game on my behalf might have won it for me or gotten a draw but that is chess.}
