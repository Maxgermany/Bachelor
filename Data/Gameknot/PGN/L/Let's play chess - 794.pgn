1. e4 Nf6 {Alekhine Defense.} 2. Nc3 e5 3. Bc4 d6 4. h3 c6 {Now the defense has morphed into a Philidor, which I am beginning to like more and more.} 5. Nf3 Be7 6. d4 exd4 7. Nxd4 O-O 8. f4 Nxe4 9. O-O {If White plays Nxe4, d5 forks N and B.  } Nxc3 10. bxc3 {White's pawn structure is very slightly compromised since the doubled pawns are also isolated.} Nd7 11. Qf3 Nf6 {The f6 N is important to Kingside defense.} 12. Bd2 c5 {The center pawns are mobile and now begin to cause problems for White.} 13. Ne2 d5 14. Bd3 c4 {The light-square B has no retreat.} 15. Bxh7+ Kxh7 {Black is now up material, at the cost of compromised King safety.  Must stay active so White does not have time to organize an attack.} 16. f5 Bd7 17. Ng3 Rh8 18. Bg5 Bc6 19. Bxf6 Bxf6 20. Qg4 Kg8 {The vulnerable g7 pawn is well protected for now.} 21. Rae1 Rh4 22. Qf3 {On f3, the Q is vulnerable to tempos.} d4 23. Qe2 d3 24. cxd3 cxd3 {The Q must move again.  Black has gained substantial time.} 25. Qf2 Bxc3 26. Red1 Bd4 {White must have missed this pin.} 27. Kh2 Bxf2 28. Rxf2 {White is in deep trouble with this much loss of material.} Qd6 29. Rdd2 Re8 {}
