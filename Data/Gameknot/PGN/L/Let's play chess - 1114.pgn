1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bc4 Bc5 5. Ng5 O-O 6. d3 d6 7. O-O Bg4 8. Qe1 {Here is where White's troubles begin.} Nd4 9. Qd2 {At this point I am seeing that my Knights are probably my most dangerous pieces in this game. They have all kinds of potential.} h6 10. h3 {If I could have taken that Pawn with the Bishop forcing him to use his Pwan on g to retake, I woudl have a nice fork with the Knight at f3. That is what I was jockeying for, but his Knight prevents it, so I have to back off temporarily.} Bh5 11. Nxf7 {He sees the potential Knight fork at f3 that would destroy his Pawn defense of the King and opts to sacrifice a Knight rather than move his Knight to f3 where I could take with the Bishop setting up the fork.} Bxf7 12. Nd5 Nh5 13. c3 Ne6 14. b4 Bb6 15. a4 c6 16. Nxb6 Qxb6 17. a5 Qd8 18. Qa2 Nef4 19. Qc2 {He needs to take the threat of those Knights more seriously. This Queen move achieved nothing offensively or defensively. I guess he hopes to march that Rook Pawn forward ???} Bxc4 20. dxc4 {Moving his Queen allowed me to trade Bishops leaving him with a doubled Pawn. The great thing about being ahead in material is that you don't mind trades. And my Knights are still poised to attack.} Qg5 21. g3 {This was not good for White. He needed something better, but I don't know what. pushing the Pawn on f would allow his Queen to defend the Pawn in front of the King. That would have been better, I think.} Nxh3+ 22. Kh2 Qg4 23. Be3 {He is adding defense to a Pawn that is adequately defended and not my target, anyhow. I am not interested in opening that file for his Rook.} Ng5 {He would be best to take the Knight with his Bishop as it is very dangerous now.} 24. Kg2 {He can't run away, but that is the plan he decided upon. g2 is not a safer place for the King than h2 was.} Qh3+ {Mate in one (25. Kg1, Nf3)! That Knight should have been taken out by the Bishop before, but now it is too late.}
