1. c4 {I remember Bobby playing this opening. I like the oddness of it. Though I have been smashed by accurate players of the black pieces.} e5 {This the most respected and accurate reply} 2. Nc3 {trying to command the white central squares} c6 3. d4 {with the pawn advancing to c6, I push d4, figuring the queen can't be attacked by the knight as is common with Nc6. } exd4 4. Qxd4 h6 {Preventing Bg5, my guess.} 5. Nf3 f6 {5 moves in and black has yet to develop a piece. How do I capitalize?} 6. e3 Na6 {Setting a foothold for his bishop on c5} 7. a3 Bc5 8. Qg4 g5 {not much of a threat, the queen by herself, better I think would be d5!} 9. Qh5+ Kf8 10. Bd3 Ne7 11. Ne4 {attacking the bishop and BP respectively} d5 12. Nxc5 {Maybe the pawn would have been easier but I have a thing for killing bishops } Nxc5 13. Be2 {my mistake, should have kept my diagonal at c2} Nb3 {for just that reason!} 14. Rb1 Bf5 15. Bd2 Bxb1 {why not? free rook} 16. Bd1 dxc4 17. Bc3 Nf5 18. O-O Be4 19. Be2 b5 20. Rd1 Qc7 {allowing the pawn snatch at f6} 21. Bxf6 Rh7 22. Ne5 {got to get the pieces at the king} Bd5 23. Bg4 Nh4 24. Ng6+ Nxg6 25. Qxg6 Nc5 26. Bf5 Be4 27. Bxe4 Rd7 28. Qxh6+ Kf7 29. Rxd7+ Nxd7 30. Qg6+ Kf8 31. Qg7+ Ke8 32. Bg6# {saved my ass}
