[Opening "King's pawn game (C20)"]

1. e4 e5 {I choose to play a Classical response.} 2. c4 {An interesting variation. White is clearly aiming to control his Q5.} Nf6 {I choose a reply that develops and counterattacks.} 3. Nc3 {The advantage of White's second move is that now his QN is not blocking his QBP, in spite of being developed on its natural square.} Bc5 {I give my King the option of K-side castling.} 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. d3 {With this move, White confirms he is playing for a light-square game. The position is somewhat resemblant of an English Opening.} Ng4 6. d4 {Inconsistent with his earlier moves. I would play 6 B-K3 instead. Black can win a Pawn in the ensuing exchanges, but I end up a Pawn ahead anyway after the move actually played, and 6 B-K3 would enable White to maintain strong central Pawns as compensation.} exd4 {The natural move.} 7. Ne2 d3 {Reestablishing my threat to fork Q and R.} 8. Ned4 {The only way to counter both the fork and the Pawn threat on the Knight.} Nxd4 9. Nxd4 Bxd4 10. Qxg4 {Ah, who needs Knights anyway? I ended up ahead one Pawn in the scuffle.} Qf6 11. Qf3 Bxb2 {Since my adavanced QP is likely to fall soon, I add a second Pawn to my gains.} 12. Qxf6 {Exchanging off the Queens while down in material, even if we assume my advanced QP will fall, seems a dubious idea. White seemed to have a betetr line with 12 BxB QxB 13 Q-Q1, keeping the Queens on the board and ensuring the fall of the advanced QP. Now I can play for an endgame advantage.} Bxf6 13. Rb1 b6 14. Bxd3 Bb7 {We've now reached the endgame, and I'm up a Pawn and have two Q-side targets [White's isolated P's on the QB and QR files]. I fancy my chances.} 15. O-O O-O-O 16. Be3 c6 {I'm intending to play ...P-Q4 and remove the White QBP, giving me a passed Pawn on the Q-side.} 17. f4 d5 18. e5 Be7 19. Rfc1 dxc4 {Mission accomplished. Now my QBP will, hopefully, be decisive. I need to remove a few more pieces from the board first to make the passed Pawn tell.} 20. Bxc4 c5 21. Bxf7 {Oops. Now White has equalized the material and has a passed Pawn of his own. A simple blunder on my part.} Rhf8 22. Be6+ Kc7 23. f5 {A weak move. Now the white KBP loses the protection of the QB and no longer protects the KP.} Bc8 {I try to exploit this weakening with a small tactical combination.} 24. Bxc8 {White submits to the Bishop exchange.} Kxc8 25. Rcf1 {Guarding the Pawn with a Rook.} Rd5 {Winning one of the Pawns.} 26. e6 Rdxf5 {White is down a Pawn, but his KP is still a threat. I have to be careful. Right now my B is in a blockading position.} 27. Rxf5 {Behind in material, I wouldn't recommend simplifying. 27 R(B1)-K1, placing the Rook in position to guard the KP, seems better.} Rxf5 {Now my Rook controls the open file, and I threaten 28...R-K4, attacking both the Bishop and the passed Pawn.} 28. Rd1 Re5 {White cannot defend both.} 29. Rd7 {Counterattack.} Rxe6 {Now the Rook and Bishop are both en prise and the dangerous passed Pawn is gone. Up two Pawns, I'm starting to feel very confident.} 30. Rd3 {The only move.} Rd6 {I offer an exchange of Rooks.} 31. Ra3 {My opponent wisely refuses.} Kb7 {Guarding the base Pawn in the chain.} 32. Bf4 Rc6 33. Rd3 {White switches from attacking the Pawn to attacking the King.} Bf6 34. Be3 h6 {This move will later prove very significant, as the Bishop can now move to KN4 with protection.} 35. a4 a5 {Blocking the QRP and creating a haven for my K at QR3.} 36. Rd7+ {The White counterattack on my King commences.} Ka6 {Preventing a Rook check on the second rank.} 37. Bf4 {Plotting a mate.} c4 {Time to push the Pawn, which is guarded from behind by the Rook.} 38. Bb8 {Tricky. If I'm not paying attention, 39 R-R7 would be mate!} b5 {"Curses!" growls the villain, stroking his black mustache. "Foiled again!"} 39. axb5+ {Practically forced, otherwise 39...P-N5 would give me connected passed Pawns.} Kxb5 {Completing the exchange.} 40. Bf4 {Guarding the QBP's Queening square.} c3 {Pushing forward.} 41. Kf1 c2 {I plan 42...B-N4, driving the White B off the diagonal and forcing the successful Queening of the Pawn. I also have the QRP in reserve, if a second Pawn needs to be advanced to force one through.} 42. Rb7+ Ka6 43. Rd7 {White can do very little to stop me.} Bg5 44. Bxg5 hxg5 {It's all over now.} 45. Ke2 c1=Q {White resigns.}
