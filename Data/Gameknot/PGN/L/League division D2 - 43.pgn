1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nc6 4. d5 {I wanted to gain space in the middle.} Ne5 5. Nxe5 {I exchanged Knights so it would double Black's pawns on the e-file.} dxe5 6. Bb5+ {Analysis by Fritz 8 says that White is ahead by almost a full pawn here.} Bd7 7. Qe2 a6 8. Bxd7+ Qxd7 9. c4 {I made this move in order to fix Black's pawns on the dark squares in order to limit his Bishop's mobility.} Nf6 10. h3 {This move was made to avoid an exchange on g4. I did not want to trade Queen's at this point since mine is crucial to holding my position together. I was focused on keeping my Pawns where they were. Fritz 8 says I should've made the move Nc3.} b5 11. b3 e6 12. O-O Be7 13. Nc3 O-O {I expected ...b4 here. In that case, I had planned on trying to get the Knight to b6 via a4. I realize now that the plan was faulty and Fritz 8 shows it to be a weak move.} 14. Rd1 exd5 15. Nxd5 Nxd5 16. Rxd5 {I wanted to control this d-file with my Rooks at any cost.} Qe6 17. Bb2 {I made this move to force Black into the ...f6 move which put another pawn on the dark-squares, thus blocking his Bishop in even more.} f6 18. Rad1 {Following through with putting my Rooks on the d-file.} Rfd8 19. a3 {I realize now that this wasn't a good move. I didn't want to trade the Rooks by taking on d8, which is what Fritz 8 suggests.} b4 20. a4 {I didn't take the Pawn because I knew it would free the Black Bishop.} Rxd5 21. Rxd5 Rd8 22. Qd3 Rxd5 23. Qxd5 Kf7 24. f3 a5 {At this point, the draw was offered by Black. I was tempted to exchange Queens and knew that the Black King could not break through. Eventually the Pawns would be exchanged and the Black Bishop would be free to roam. I wasn't sure of my chances in the endgame so I accepted the draw.}
