1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. Nf3 Bf5 4. c3 {Necessary or Nb4 would be an annoyance.} Qd7 {Not common. Normal is Nf6, e6 etc.} 5. Nbd2 O-O-O {Royal pieces aligned, and I have a dsb... } 6. h3 {Let's go for the diagonal. I have a plan, based on...} f6 7. g4 Bg6 8. h4 {...based on g4 is "defended" by the threat of Bh3, winning the Q. I can't play g5, though, or f5.} e5 {? black is just not strong enough on e4.} 9. dxe5 fxe5 10. Bxe5 Nxe5 11. Nxe5 {Won the exchange on e5.} Qe6 12. Ndf3 Bd6 {g5 is not a threat while black can interpose the lsb, so...} 13. Nxg6 Qxg6 14. Qxd5 {...and g4 is still "defended" by Ba3.} Nf6 15. Qe6+ {? Qa5 won a tempo by threatening a7.} Kb8 16. g5 {The g4 pawn is not "defended" bt Bh3 now, so I have to defend it. } Rhe8 17. Qb3 {Maybe better was Qc4, to prevent Ng4, but Re4 would have done it anyway. } Ng4 18. Bh3 {Even better, Bg7, threatening Ne5 (and mate in b7).} Nxf2 {? It looks tempting, but...} 19. Kxf2 h5 20. Qc4 {Made to prevent the Bdsb to reach f4 or c5.} b6 21. Rae1 Bc5+ {I'm +4, but I'm struggling with the defence. } 22. e3 Qc2+ 23. Re2 Bxe3+ 24. Kg2 {Not on the black squares, of course. } Qg6 {Could have black tried something more? It doesn't seem so!} 25. Rhe1 Re4 {Good spot, but..} 26. Qb5 c6 27. Ne5 {Played with resignation to exchange Q's. } Rg4+ {? Black must defend c6.} 28. Bxg4 hxg4 29. Nxc6+ {Probably black overlooked this one.} Kc7 30. Re2xe3 {! If NxR, Qe5+, and Black can find counterplay (more than QxNc6).} Rd2+ 31. Kg1 {The only think I need is not another check.} Qxc6 {Easy way...} 32. Re3e7+ Rd7 {Here I lost by time, without seeing the winning...} 33. Rxd7+ {KxR is impossible due to Re2+, and if KxR, QxQ, but if Kd6, Qe5#.} Qxd7 {This forces the simplification.} 34. Qxd7+ Kxd7 {And white wins!}
