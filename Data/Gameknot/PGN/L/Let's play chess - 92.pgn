Bb2 {it is a battle of rook vs bishop, who will win?} h5 {I decide to bring out second rook into battefield} 4. h4 {he blocks pawn advance very balance symmetry} Rhh6 {I will win with my superior advantage hogs on the sixth rank} 5.

Nb5 {he attacks it with the knight} Rd5 {so i get out of the way} 8. f4 {moving same twice in opening not advisable} Re4 {I target the new weakness} 9. g3 {which he defends} e5 {I come all out attack in the center I think I have a better advantage due to superior control of the center, White is lost.} 10. Bg2 {He comes out with second bishop} f5 {I defend my rook} 11. Bxe4 {he takes it, but} fxe4 {I am bringing a flank pawn to the center, so I should have more than enough compensation for the sacrificed exchange.} 12.

Nh3 {he brings knight out} Nh6 {same as I do} 19.
