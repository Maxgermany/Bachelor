1. e4 {Another lost game...} e5 2. d4 {Center game} Nc6 {The first mistake. d5 lets white control the center from the beginning} 3. d5 Nd4 4. c3 {The Knight is lost, so} c6 {black try to continue the development. However, Nf6 would have been better.} 5. cxd4 Qa5+ {Pointless move. Again, Nf6 was better} 6. Bd2 Qb6 7. Bc3 d6 {Activating the bishop} 8. dxe5 cxd5 9. exd5 dxe5 10. Bxe5 {now white fully controls the center} Bb4+ 11. Nc3 Nf6 {a couple of good, developing moves from black} 12. a3 Bc5 13. Qe2 Bg4 {a mistake, that leads to a forced queen exchange, excellent situation for white} 14. Qb5+ Qxb5 15. Nxb5 Be7 {I have thought a lot about this move and the only excuse is that black tried to defend the knidht, so that in case of an exchange, the pawn structure isn't broke. however, with Nc7 in the air, it is the worst move of the game} 16. Nc7+ Kd7 17. Bb5+ {An excellent move from white, which brings one more piece into attack without losing material. Here I resigned and this is the move I regret most, as, if you aren't smart enough to win, you still have to be polite enough, to fight until the end and let your opponent mate you.}
