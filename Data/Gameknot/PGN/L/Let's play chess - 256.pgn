[Opening "Petrov (C42), Italian variation"]

1. e4 {King pawn's opening.} e5 {What shall it be; Vienna, Bishop, Center Pawn, Center Game, Danish, King's Gambit, Petroff, Roy Lopez, Italian, or perhaps even the Fried Liver} 2. Nf3 {Things are shaping up now. Ruy, Italian, or the Fried Liver would be fun!!} Nf6 {Oh, a switch-a-roonie by black, and out comes the Petroff. Very cool, I really enjoy the petroff!!} 3. Bc4 {White takes a road somewhat less traveled here, the Petroff-Italian Variation. Now that we have our opening well established, let's see if White stays the course or risks uncharted waters. Should be fun!!} Nxe4 {I'm going to stay the course and play as accurate as I can, afterall my opponent has both tempo and out-rates quit a bit.} 4. Qe2 {At this point the percentages favor black, but let's see if I have what it takes, it's early days still.} d5 {Black stays the course.} 5. Bb3 {Nxe5 perhaps a little more accurate, Bb3 is still good. Lots of play remaining} Bg4 {Black continues to stay the course. These waters are still fairly well charted.}
