1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bc4 {This move can lead to the Boden-Kieseritzky Gambit or the Four Knights game but in this case ends up in neither.} h6 {I was thinking about preventing the White Knight from getting to b5 but there is no reason to waste time with this move now. I can make it after Ng5 and thus gain a tempo when the Knight retreats.} 4. d3 Nc6 5. a3 {My opponent responds in kind.} d5 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. h3 {I think at this point my position might be better as I've got avenues for both Bishops available} Bc5 8. O-O O-O 9. Re1 Re8 {Covering the threatened pawn} 10. Bd2 {This move covers the c3 square which the White Knight quickly occupies} Bf5 11. Nc3 {Here I can make several moves such as: 11. ... Be6 which I don't like because I'm moving the same piece again and into a more defensive position, or 11. ... Nce7 which I think might have been a better choice than the one I make.} Nxc3 12. Bxc3 {I've traded off a well positioned Knight and allowed White to get his dark-squared Bishop in a good spot.} Bd6 13. Bb5 e4 {I might have played 13. ... Bd7 hoping eventually to play a6 pushing away the light-squared Bishop and I think it might be better than the game move.} 14. dxe4 Rxe4 15. Bxc6 Rxe1+ 16. Nxe1 bxc6 {This leaves the game even in material but my doubled c-pawns are weak although I've got the Bishop pair. I'd call things fairly even at this point.} 17. Nf3 c5 {There aren't too many squares for my Queen at this stage and this protects the forward c-pawn and clears a diagonal for my Queen in a bit} 18. Qe2 Qd7 19. Rd1 {I didn't take this as a threat as my dark-squared Bishop is going to be difficult to dislodge from its nice diagonal} c4 {I'm hoping my opponent falls into a trap here: 20. Qxc4 Bh2+ 21. Kxa2 Qxd1 but this does not come to pass.} 20. Kh1 {Relieving the potential threat of Bh2+ although I thought perhaps 20. Kf1 might be better.} Qa4 21. Nd4 {Protecting the c-pawn and attacking my Bishop} Bg6 {I liked the diagonal because I was targeting the c-pawn as the weakest on the board although a King pawn push from White is a distinct threat at this point} 22. Rc1 {Freeing up the Knight to roam} Re8 23. Qd2 Be4 24. f3 Bb7 {So, now i'm off that diagonal anyway but this is an excellent place for the Bishop as well. The Bishop pair is serving me well in this game.} 25. Nf5 Be5 {Now I trade off the pair but I didn't really see a good place to move the dark-squared Bishop. Perhaps 25. ... Bc5 is better.} 26. Bxe5 Rxe5 27. Qd8+ Qe8 28. Qxe8+ {I think this is right as 28. Qxc7 Bxf3 29. gxf3 Rxf5 30. Qxa7 Rxf3 leaves White's king very exposed } Rxe8 29. Rd1 Re5 30. Rd8+ Kh7 31. g4 {This is a mistake I think as it gives me a free pawn. Perhaps better is 31. Nd4} Bxf3+ 32. Kg1 Bd1 {An absolute blunder} 33. Rxd1 Re2 {Now I'm simply trying to pick off as many pawns as possible and hope somehow to get into an end game with no pawns.} 34. Rc1 g6 35. Nd4 {My Rook here on the 7th rank prevents the King from entering the game and is vital in my eventually gaining the draw} Rd2 36. Nb5 {Dropping one of my pawns. Things are looking bleak.} f5 37. Nxc7 f4 {I figured a passed is better than the exchange but I could be wrong.} 38. Ne6 g5 39. Nc5 f3 {My threat here is to get my Rook to h2 and then to h1 winning the Rook but I don't think it is that dangerous} 40. Ne4 Re2 41. Nf2 {This does stop my threat but ties up the Knight which could be snapping up my loose pawns.} Kg7 42. Kf1 Kf6 43. a4 Kg6 {I can move my King to the e-file because of Re1 which forces me to trade Rooks and then the Knight will pick up all my pawns.} 44. Nh1 {This was the mistake that opened the way to a draw. I think my opponent hoped to play 45. Ng3 and chase my Rook off} Rh2 {45. Ng3 Rxh3 although losing a pawn is probably better than the game continuation} 45. Kg1 Rg2+ 46. Kf1 Rh2 {Again, I'm not sure why my opponent allowed the position to repeat instead of playing Ng3 losing a pawn.} 47. Kg1 Rg2+ 48. Kf1 Rh2 49. Kg1 Rg2+ {I was happy to escape a losing position with a draw although somewhat fortunate. I thought I played fairly well in this game up until I blundered the Bishop. I think I was in a strong position to win the game until that point.}
