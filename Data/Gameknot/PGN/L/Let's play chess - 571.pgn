1. e4 d5 2. Nc3 {Scandinavian} c6 {supports the d pawn and opens a small line to a5 for my queen but restricts the options for my knight} 3. d3 {This seems a little passive to me although it is still a part of the opening} d4 {pushing the white knight away} 4. Na4 {Nce2 is surely better. This move eventually loses the knight} e5 {propping up my d pawn and opening lines for my dsb} 5. a3 Nf6 6. h3 {protecting the g4 square} b5 {There he goes} 7. c4 {This closes up the centre completely} bxa4 8. Qxa4 Bd6 {Preparing to castle} 9. Bg5 Bd7 {looking for a revealed attack on the white queen, the centre is completely closed up so c5 will make little difference} 10. Nf3 c5 11. Qb3 {I was expecting Qc2 or d1 to allow the queen to swap to the kingside for an assault on my king} O-O 12. Nh4 {I really can't see the point of this move it sidelines the knight} h6 13. Bxf6 Qxf6 {now I am expecting the knight to move back to where it was} 14. g3 {If black is intending to castle kings side he could be in big trouble} Bc7 {Looking to get my dsb into a better position, from here I can try to force the king to move so that he cannot castle} 15. Qb7 {This is a mistake for white as we wlll see} Ba5+ {taking the only undefended piece away from the white queen} 16. b4 Bc6 {White's greed has lost him his queen and my lsb is also now on a really nice diagonal} 17. Qxa8 Bxa8 18. bxa5 Nc6 {Looking to finally get my knight into action I am aiming at the area in front of the white king via a5} 19. Nf5 {Although this is a better place for the knight white needs to try to get some of his other pieces active} Ne7 {Slight change of plan} 20. h4 {Another mistake from white, he hasn't noticed that his e pawn is pinned to his rook} Nxf5 21. Rg1 Ne7 22. Bh3 Qf3 {pins the g pawn to the bishop and severely restricts the options for the white kng, white is looking very cramped now} 23. Rd1 Ng6 {looking for Nf4} 24. Bf5 Ne7 25. Bd7 Rb8 {At this point I finally realised that I needed my rook in action though I am expecting Bb5} 26. Bb5 Bc6 27. Bxc6 Nxc6 28. a6 Rb3 {terrible move, Rb2 is much better} 29. a4 Nb4 {I still haven't seen Rb2 - looking at Nxd3 with mate to follow} 30. Kf1 Nxd3 31. Rxd3 Rb1+ 32. Rd1 Rxd1# {Thankyou for reading please feel free to comment}
