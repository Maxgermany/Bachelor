1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {the Petrov defense is a favorite of several grandmasters and I myself have used it on several occassions. I do not recommend this defense to players because it loses alot of flexibility in favor of a very commital sort of pawn structure and piece development.} 3. Bc4 {This is the classical way of handling the Petrov, I prefer this over playing d4 only because I like to prepare first.} Nf6 4. d3 {This is fast approaching a more apprpriate Italian Game position. I don't mind the change.} h6 {this move simply loses time, better would have been to either play Nc6, Bg4, or Be7.} 5. Nc3 Bd7 6. O-O Be7 7. h3 {this move is in preparation for Be3 (preparing d4 as in my previous note). However, it is a weakness that Black can target, I should have erred on the side of caution.} Nc6 8. Be3 Qc8 {A move I did not expect but a dubious sacrifice on h3. I react violently and irrationally.} 9. Nh2 {This knight stays out of play for a long time, a result of inapprpriate panic.} Be6 {trading off a good bishop rather than attempting the attack against my king, simply castling is recommended.} 10. f4 {one plus of placing the knight on the rim is the release of this pawn, I made the best of my previous weak move.} Bxc4 {In a discussion with my opponent I explained that this capture is not as damageing to my position as some might think. Alekhine has employed this method of opening the position on several occassions.} 11. dxc4 Qd7 12. f5 {locking down the kingside, I see the coming queenside castle and I'm resisting the opening against my king.} O-O-O 13. Qd3 {this move looks weak but it actually is part of the plan to release my pieces against Black's king.} Rhg8 {a waste of time that Black does not have but what else can he do?} 14. Nd5 Nxd5 {this move should have been put off as long as possible, now white's hold on the center and the game is comfortable.} 15. cxd5 Nb4 {I had assumed Black would play Nb8 and keep the knight guarding his king, this move is energetic but is just a weakness.} 16. Qc4 Qa4 17. c3 {I considered b3 but this seems better.} Qc2 {the only move} 18. Qxb4 b6 19. Rf2 {Now the queen comes into danger, Black is a piece down and on his heels, he's lost.} Qd3 20. Re1 Bh4 {This move provides complication and in a level position is cause for fear by white, but here he's already a piece ahead, he's winning.} 21. Rd2 {if White weren't up in material QxR, BxR, and BxR, BxB compicates and prolongs the struggle, it just isn't possible here. } Qa6 22. Ra1 {Black won't even get the consolation of a pawn for his knight sortee.} Bg3 23. Nf3 {Now the knight comes back in with a good position.} Qb7 24. a4 a5 25. Qc4 f6 26. b4 Bf4 {I was prepared for this move and I was happy to simplify and get a better square for my knight.} 27. Bxf4 exf4 28. Nd4 {The knight couldn't go here with the pawn at e5.} Rde8 29. Ne6 f3 30. gxf3 g6 {a good attempt to open the position for the Black rooks, he's trying hard to gain an advantage.} 31. fxg6 {taking to keep my pawn stricture intact, I'm wagering that I can weather any offensive.} Rxg6+ 32. Kh2 Reg8 33. f4 Qa7 34. bxa5 {This move is foolish and is the result of not calculating (laziness). Simpler is b5 trapping the Queen in the corner and freeing my queen to move around and maybe pick up a rook or two.} bxa5 {Here is a key position, I should play Qxp and trade quens while goping up a second pawn, but I faulter.} 35. Rb1 {??} Rg6g1 {Only now do I see the mate threats.} 36. Rbb2 {?? I am lost but I can't do much else.} Re1 {Here my opponent faulters and loses, 36. ... Rh8 ! Kxh8(forced) 37.Qg8   and for all his efforts White loses.} 37. Rdg2 {The onlt saving move but it ruins the mate threats and offers good simplification.} Rg1 38. Nxc7 Rg1xg2+ 39. Rxg2 Rxg2+ 40. Kxg2 Qxc7 41. Qxc7+ Kxc7 {The rest of this game is endgame technique but is worth study by a diligent student.} 42. Kf3 Kb6 43. Kg4 Kc5 44. Kf5 Kc4 45. Kxf6 Kb3 46. e5 dxe5 47. fxe5 Kxa4 48. e6 Kb3 49. e7 a4 50. e8=Q a3 51. d6 a2 52. Qe1 Kb2 53. d7 a1=Q 54. Qxa1+ Kxa1 55. d8=Q Ka2 56. Qb6 h5 57. c4 h4 58. c5 Ka3 59. c6 {}
