1. e4 c5 {So, I am continuing with my adventures with the sicilian} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {All is standard so far, what will white play here ?} 6. a4 {I'm surprised, normally it's a bishop or the f pawn, but I guess he wants to prevent b5} Nbd7 {I play as normal} 7. Be2 {Now the bishop} e5 8. Nf3 Nc5 9. Nd2 {I like this it has blocked the black squared bishop, I continue} Be7 10. O-O Be6 11. a5 O-O {I suspect he will play b4 to chase the knight away, which is kind of ok because I want to put my rooks on the c file} 12. b4 Ncd7 13. Bf3 {I am really unsure of the purpose of this move, time to stop this q side onslaught} b5 14. Re1 Rc8 {I think I can cause white some problems along here} 15. Bb2 Qc7 16. Rc1 Qb7 17. Nf1 Rc4 18. Na2 {White is being slowly pinned back, and now I can exert a little more pressure on this c file} Rfc8 19. Ne3 Rc4c7 20. Nd5 {20 moves before first blood} Nxd5 21. exd5 Bf5 22. Re2 Bg5 23. Ra1 Bxc2 24. Rxc2 Rc7xc2 25. Bc1 Bxc1 26. Nxc1 Nf6 {White is still not out of the woods} 27. Nb3 Qa7 {Black turns attention to the f pawn} 28. Qe1 e4 29. Bd1 Rb2 30. Rc1 Rxc1 31. Nxc1 Qd4 {Nice central square for the queen, I think it is just a matter of time now, white has no counter play } 32. Ne2 Qd2 33. Kf1 Qd3 {White is running out of moves, black is threatening Rb1, white's position is totally passive} 34. Kg1 Rb1 35. Nc3 {Think I will have that knight } Qxc3 {White resigns the poistion is hopeless}
