1. d4 {Saved by miracle... or pity?} Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. h3 e6 5. g4 Be4 6. Nbd2 Bxf3 7. Nxf3 Bd6 8. Ne5 Nfd7 {Here, the correct pawn advance is g5, in order to prevent f6 because after gxf6, gxf6, Nd3, white has opened the black's kingside, and with e3 can bring the queen into the attack.  But I overlooked it. } 9. h4 f6 10. Nd3 Qe7 11. e3 {the resulting position is similar, but the black pawn structure is much better. } e5 12. dxe5 fxe5 13. Bg5 Nf6 {Next move the dsb is trapped. The only way to save it was h5 (h6, Bh4). Moreover, the d3 knight can be badly threatened by e4. Going to f4 means BxN, exf4... leaving a damaged pawn structure. So I thought I had not time enough for h5. Obviously, my position is inferior, already. } 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 {I thought he would have taken with the pawn, consolidating an impressive center. True this way he has pressure over f2.} 15. f4 {Now, if e4, the knight can retire to f2. It is not a wonderful choice, but it seemed to me that I had to react, even weakening my king (I hope I can castle queenside sooner or later).} Nd7 {Hmmm... in his shoes, I would have gone on with the attack, e5xf4. This move gives me a breath. } 16. g5 {I want to take advantage of the uneasy black queen's position soon, before he castles queenside and gives the rooks into the game. } Qf7 17. Qg4 {Clearing the queenside castling and making him take care of what the hell is doing my queen up there :-)} e4 18. Nf2 {Ah, but this is not a good place for the knight. Just the only one!} O-O-O {Now, I realize that the center pawns are going to advance. Bb4+ is there... C5 too.  Just castling seems to be ok, but d4 threats Qxa2... so the castling is not so wise as it seems. Let's contest a little his center advance. } 19. c3 Kb8 20. b3 {You'll say I am not developing. Right. But this way, if he plays d4, I can play Bc4. Passive moves as Be2 are nasty. I was hoping Bh3 would be useful, but not yet. } Rhf8 {He is seeking a sac in f4, Bxf4. Later. } 21. Bh3 {Maybe now I could have castled. But I was thinking if a kingside castling could have been playable. I have no pieces in the queenside, and to castle this side is like a suicide. } Ne5 {I couldn't see this move. Now I really think I lost the game. } 22. Qe6 {The white bishop must help, over there...} Qh5 {I analyzed fxNe5, but the queen and the rook combined were too dangerous. e3 is unprotected... I like to risk, but this time it is better to be patient and wise. } 23. Bg4 {I lose my beloved bishop, but I couldn't allow Qxh4...} Nxg4 24. Qxg4 {Black attack loses spin, momentarily. } Qxg4 25. Nxg4 {It doesn't look nice, but a breath is given. Now, castilng is silly. The king must help to freeze the pawn storm that is approaching. } c5 {Naturally. What's the right way to cope with d4?} 26. Rd1 {By castling I let the bishop check in a3, which was a tactic he had in some variants I studied. } Bc7 {d4 is coming... and I cannot allow him to take in f4. How to stop it?} 27. b4 {An apparent mistake, but I needed a pawn in b4 to stop the bishop's future action. The only jolly I had is that when the d column opens, I can take RxR+, and by taking it back I have time to defend f4. } cxb4 28. cxb4 {Yes, I know...} d4 29. Rf1 {Here. If dxe3, RxR+ and can take back the pawn... losing f4, but lightening some of the center pressure. } d3 {Dubious. Ok, the black pawns look frightening, but not as much as before. Of course, I know he is looking for the right moment to play Bxf4!} 30. Nf2 {I was almost sure he would have played Rf-e8.} Rfe8 31. Kd2 {He he, the king itself is playing. I calculated there was no better way to free my rooks. The king must be prepared to help on the queenside. I have no time to repeat all the variants I looked. I was fearing black's a5. } Bxf4 {Now! He he, I always considered it. My response was calculated well before. } 32. Nxe4 {I would say I will lose more pawns here, after the exchanges, but he considered he lost his spin... RxN, RxB. If Bxe3, KxB and, regardeless the pin, I won't lose the knight. He will lose his d pawn...  So he offered draw, and of course I accepted!} Rxe4 {}
