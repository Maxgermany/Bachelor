1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. Be2 {this called the classical variation of the dragon Sicilian .} O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Nb3 {the idea is to keep the control on d4 square , all so good moves here are 9.0-0 , 9.f3 .} Be6 {good move , because of the retreat the white knight to b3 and the fact that the white's LSB developed to e2 , i decided to develop my LSB on active position on e6 , which controlls the c4 square .} 10. f3 {this was unnecessary , the whites  LSB developed to e2 and it covers the g4 square , it means that the black move Ng4 is not possible , its not  the Yugoslavian attack (7.Bc4 variation ) where ,white should play f3 to avoid blacks Ng4 , there for because of the whites LSB on e2 presents , this move seems to be a waist of time , however  maybe white wanted to keep his bishops pare . } Rc8 {the idea is to activate the rook on active position , another idea is that i am preparing the knight manoeuvre to c4 sqaure from e5 (Nc6-e5-c4) , however 10...d5 was better move here , the idea is to destroy whites center and open the position because of the fact that the white king stiil on the center .} 11. Bh6 {the idea is to exchange the DSBs  as soon as posible  .} Bxh6 12. Qxh6 Qb6 {good move , the  black queen takes active position on the a7-g1 diagonal , avoides 0-0,avoids active moves whites Nd4 after Rd1 or 0-0-0 and makes more room to the other rook to join the game .} 13. O-O-O {its can be dangerous for white king  to stay on the center there for , white must 0-0-0 its the only option he have , however black can destroy his pawn structure on the queen side and expose little bit the white king .} Bxb3 14. axb3 Qa5 {good move , the black queens is like a white sharks who smells blood of an injoured prey and going to strike , the black take advantage of the exposed white king and the weakness of the whites queen side ,and bring his queen to the open A file and threats unpleasnd check on a1 , its looke not so good for white now .} 15. g4 {whites ignore the threat and go for a contra play on the blacks king side ,however  the whites king exposing gives black the advantage to be faster here.} Nb4 {good move , 15...Qb1+.16.Nb1-Nb4.17.c3 and i don't have something special, however 15...Nb4!makes more effect on my threat Qa1+.for example 16....Qb1+.17Kd2-Qxb2!(17.Nb1-Rxc2+) and white in deep trouble. the idea of Nb4 is to open some kind of a pine on the whites Nc3 because of if the white knight will move the c pawn will die and maybe so as his king .} 16. Bd3 Qa1+ 17. Nb1 Nd7 {good move , the idea is to manoeuvre the knight to e5 and makes strong pressure on d3. and the problem for white is that it seems that he doesn't a wear of his dangerous situation , and  don't pay attention on whats happening on his back Yard.} 18. h4 Ne5 19. Bc4 Rxc4 {very nice  combinatioan that i saw , the capturing of the black rook will leads to strong mate attack which force white to give back material with more . } 20. bxc4 Nxc4 { and white resigns,  for the reason that now black simply threats 21...Qxb2#,and Na2# there for 22.Rd4-Qxb2+.23.Kd1-Qxd4+ and white without a piece and lose the game , if.22. Rde1-Qxb2+.23.Kd1-Qxc2# or if 22.Rdg1-Qxb2+.23.Kd1-Qxc2+.24.Ke1-Nd3+.25.Kf1-Qf2# . its hopeless position for white , thank you and hope you enjoyed the game .}
