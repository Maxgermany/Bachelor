1. e4 {An elegant mate..} e5 {standard opening. In this game, the development of the opening favors white, but black lays a trap} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nh6 4. d4 f6 5. Bxh6 gxh6 6. d5 Nb4 7. Nc3 b6 8. O-O {At this stage, the board favors white who looks poised to secure a famous victory} h5 9. a3 Na6 10. b4 Bb7 11. Nh4 {At this stage, white is about to make several mistakes that are costly in material and end up changing the board to favor black} f5 {this challenge offers a pawn to the knight or pawn and white chooses} 12. exf5 {the wrong move. resulting in} Qxh4 {this, then } 13. g3 Qxc4 {this} 14. Qxh5+ Kd8 {then} 15. Na2 Qxd5 {this. So from even to plus 5 points because of one mistake. The board looks a lot different now, and black will mount an attack from a stronger position. } 16. f3 c6 {first I have to secure the king} 17. Nc3 {Oh, and protect my queen} Qd4+ 18. Kh1 {I like the king in the corner..I see a mate developing with my bishops help} Qxc3 {and I capture another piece} 19. Rad1 {My pawn at d-8 is vulnerable through and through though} Kc7 {so I better improvise a castle} 20. Qf7 {a near mate!} Rd8 {phew! averted} 21. Qf6 {This next decision is key. I opted to sacrifice my castle to lock the queen in the lower half of the board. I choose to do so because I am planing to bring out my bishop on f-8 to join in the mate} Qxa3 {soI capture the key pawn and increase my haul...while freeing up my bishop, sacrificing a castle, and keeping the queen on that side of the board away from my attack} 22. Qxh8 {thus} Bxb4 {and thus} 23. Qxh7 {the queen runs around aimlessly } Nb8 {now I get my bishop on b-7 involved but first I have to move my knight} 24. f6 {White does not see the danger. so he pushes a pawn } Ba6 {the long reach of the bishop again} 25. Rd3 {a castle for a bishop - of course I will thank you} Bxd3 26. Rd1 {this was a most interesting move. Why not capture the bishop?} Be2 {this is really a waste of time, because the bishop needs to move to c-5 a the queen to f-3 and its over.} 27. f7 Bxd1 28. Qg6 {this was a funny move by white. I am not sure what the plan was} Qxf3+ {but this is the end game} 29. Kg1 Bc5# {as noted, an elegant mate!}
