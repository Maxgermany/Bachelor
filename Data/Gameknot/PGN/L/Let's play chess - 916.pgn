[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Byrne (English) attack"]

1. e4 {1.e4   Someone told that this is the best opening move... :D} c5 {1... c5  The Sicilian...} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {5. ...a6  The Najdorf variation...  Look at the board. Black seems to be behind in development, and maybe is true. But he's good and ...a6 is not a waste of time!! It prevents Ndb5 and prepares ...b5, pushing queenside pawns.} 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 Be7 {7. ...Be7  7. ...Be6 is more popular, but this is not an IM or GM game! This is amateur game! } 8. Qd2 {8.Qd2  I was looking for queenside castle, while developing the Queen in an optimum square.} O-O 9. f3 {9.f3  To prevent Knight infiltrations.} Bd7 {9. ...Bd7  Out of book. Well, 9 moves in the book. Not so bad for an amateur match. But someone can note that, with the Sicilian, it's easier. I agree.  However, I think that d7 is more suitable for Knights than white-squares Bishop. } 10. O-O-O {10.O-O-O  And now my development is near to be completed.   Look at the position. I have no real advantages, but the only piece I not already moved is the white-squares Bishop, which however controls an open side of the board. Moreover I control the d-file and I'm planning a kingside pawns ride.   Black position is worse: the Queen-Knight is still in b8, the e7-Bishop is blocked, the open c-file isn't useful yet...  I was feeling good.} h6 {10. ...h6  Maybe is better to develop. Besides, this could led in future to a bishop sacrifice in h6 to expose the black monarch.} 11. g4 {11.g4  Putting pressure at the King position. No real menaces, but an annoying pawn march.} Be6 {11. ...Be6  Do you remember 7. ...Be7? This move contradicts it. Now, I'm practically a move ahead.} 12. h4 {12.h4  I gain other space. My pawns are uncomfortable for black.} Bxb3 {12. ...Bxb3  Why? Development isn't made yet and my b3-Knight didn't threaten anything. And besides, this is the third Bishop's move in the last four moves.  Again... good for me! I was feeling still very good.} 13. axb3 {13.axb3  Obviously not 13.cxb3?! discovering the King in the c-open file.  What about the weakness of my shield pawns? No problem, what can do black here? Nothing! On the contrary now I don't have to go to b1 with my King to protect the a2 pawn! :)} Nh7 {13. ...Nh7  I think looking at g5. In only a single move g5 is reached by the Bishop, the Queen, the h7-Knight and the h6 pawn.} 14. h5 {14.h5  What else? Maybe 14.Bc4, but I didn't want to lose a pawn. Obviously not 14.Nd5 Bxh4 15.Bc4 (15.Nb6 threatens nothing) Ng5 16.Bxg5?? Bxg5 and the Queen is pinned (and also lost).} Bg5 15. f4 {15.f4  Why not just Bxg5? I want to liberate myself from the backward f-pawn. Besides, f4 is not covered by the black Queen and, from here, is still visible the weak d6-pawn.} Bxf4 16. Bxf4 exf4 17. Qxf4 {17.Qxf4  Exactly the position I was looking for. My Bishop is still at home, but is the same for the black Queen-Knight. My Queen and my d-Rook point towards d6 and the position of the black King is trembling for the my advanced pawns.} Nc6 {17. ...Nc6  Finally black develops his second Knight. But now is too late.} 18. Rxd6 {18.Rxd6  Grab the pawn and attacking the Queen. When things go well in chess, it's easy to find prophylactic moves.} Qa5 {18. ...Qa5  19.Qa1  could be check, but nothing else. If I moved the bishop in a not g2 place and my Knight away from c3, 20.Qa1  would win the rook. So, no threat. } 19. Bc4 {19.Bc4  X-raying black King and developing my last still-home piece. } Nf6 {19. ...Nf6  Running away from the uncomfortable h7 square. But this permits my next move, a Rook sacrifice to suddenly open the King position.   Better was 19. ...Ng5 and then ...Ne6 to put the Knight on the court.} 20. Rxf6 {20.Rxf6  Can I put an exclamation point next to a my move? :)   20.Rxf6!} gxf6 21. Qxh6 {21.Qxh6?!  21.Qxf6 was better. Now black can defend the f6 pawn. 21.Qxf6 Kh7 22.Bxf7 Qxf7  regaining the exchange, three pawns and the bad position of the King. Not so bad...} Qd8 {21. ...Qd8?  No, better was 21. ...Qg5, looking for a queening trade. Even 21. Qe5 is better. Now I can still push my g-pawn.} 22. g5 fxg5 {22. ...fxg5  Mandatory. 23.gxf6, open the g-file, and also 23.g6 were threating. } 23. Rg1 {23.Rg1  My final preparation... } Ne5 {23. ...Ne5  What else? This position is totally lost for black.} 24. Rxg5+ {24.Rxg5   And now black must lose the Queen or suffer checkmate.  I hope you enjoy my annotations of the game. Don't hesitate to contact me for mistakes, bad advises, etc... I could have made.   Thanks to warvechaosone1 for the game and hope this comments can be useful even for him.}
