1. e4 {This is a King's pawn opening that quickly got out of anything with which I'm familiar. I dropped a pawn early but gained some initiative which allowed me to get a winning position.} e5 2. d3 {I'm not familiar with 3.d3} Bc5 {My thinking was to develop} 3. Be2 {3. Be2 again is unfamiliar to me. I'm guessing setting up a castle but the light squared bishop is blocked. I would guess 3. g3 setting up a fianchetto might be better} Nc6 {More pressure on the d4 square} 4. Nf3 Nd4 {Here I'm so excited to place my knight in a good square and attack the Bishop that I complete overlook my hanging pawn} 5. Nxe5 Nxe2 {I lose my most active piece here but do exchange a knight for a bishop} 6. Qxe2 Nf6 7. Bf4 {This doesn't really protect the knight and I thought 7. Bg5 pinning my knight might be better} d6 {Chasing off the well placed knight} 8. Nc4 Bg4 {I lost the pawn but did put the queen into a bad position so I thought pushing her around was a good strategy.} 9. Qd2 {9. f3 weakens the king side castle but I thought kept initiative for white} O-O 10. Nc3 a6 {I wanted to keep the knight off the b5 square} 11. d4 Bb4 {Pinning the knight} 12. d5 {I think not realizing 12. Nxe4 Nxe4 13. Bxd2 loses the queen} Nxe4 13. Qe3 Re8 {Setting up the discovered pin of the queen. White cannot capture 14. Nxe4 because the king is pinned by the dark squared bishop. A castle earlier in the game would have prevented this line.} 14. f3 {Forking my pieces but I suspect missing the game continuation} Nxc3 {Pins the queen} 15. Qxe8+ {I think better is 15. fxg4 Nxd5+ 16. Qxe8+ Qxe8+ 17. Kf2 but it gets a little complex.} Qxe8+ 16. Be3 {I think better is 16. Kf2 to alleviate the problem that occurs in the game continuation} Nxd5+ 17. c3 Nxe3 {Setting up another discovered check although leaving both Bishops hanging} 18. cxb4 {Also possible is 18. Nxd6 Nc4+ 19. Kf2 Nxd6 20. cxb4} Nxc4+ 19. Kf2 Qe3+ 20. Kg3 g5 {I thought this was my most inspired move of the game although my material advantage is killing in any case. If 21. Kxg4 Qf4+ 22. Kh3 Qh4#} 21. Rae1 Qf4+ 22. Kf2 Nd2 {This sets up a forced mate} 23. h3 {23. Re2 Nxf3 24. gxf3 Qxf3+ prolongs the game a few moves} Bxf3 24. gxf3 {Mate is now forced but not taking the Bishop loses even more material} Qxf3+ 25. Kg1 Qg3# {I liked the pressure I was able to develop after I blundered the pawn. This led to my opponent making some mistakes.}
