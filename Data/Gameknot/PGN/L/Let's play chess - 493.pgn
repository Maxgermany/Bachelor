[Opening "QGD (D06), Grau (Sahovic) defence"]

1. d4 {I felt like this was one of the better games of my career, so I've decided to annotate it.} d5 2. c4 {I open with the Queen's Gambit, a very popular opening in recent times.} Bf5 {He responds with the Baltic defense, a rather rare variation of the QG declined line. Most Queen's Gambit declined lines have difficulty using their light bishops, and this solves that problem by bringing it out immediately.} 3. Qb3 {I bring my Queen out, looking to attack his pawn on b7, as well as defending my c4 pawn.} b6 {He defends his pawn.} 4. cxd5 {I capture.} e6 5. dxe6 {I capture again, to get rid of my doubled pawns.} Bxe6 {Here, I am a pawn up, and have taken both of his center pawns.} 6. Qf3 {I look for weakness on the f file.} Bd5 7. e4 {My other center pawn comes out. } Bc6 8. d5 Bb7 {Notice, he has moved his bishop five times now, losing tempo.} 9. Nc3 {I seek to solidify my hold on the center.} Bb4 10. Bd2 {He pins my knight, so I bring out the bishop to block.} a6 {A defensive move: he doesn't like his options for defending Bb5.} 11. a3 {I work on dislodging his Bishop.} Bc5 12. b4 {Again...} Bd6 {He's move his Bishops a total of eight times in twelve moves now. I've taken control of the center, making it hard for him to use his pieces efficiently in the middle game.} 13. Nh3 {I try to attack his f7 pawn after Ng5.} h6 {Foiled...} 14. Bf4 g5 15. Be3 Nd7 16. Qd1 Be5 17. Rc1 Qf6 18. Bd2 O-O-O 19. g3 Qg6 20. Bg2 {I fianchetto my bishop to prepare to castle, and defend my center pawns. The game continues along this way for a time, with my minor tactical advances quickly rebuffed by him.} Ndf6 21. O-O g4 22. Nf4 Bxf4 23. Bxf4 h5 24. Ne2 {Important move here- by moving my knight, I have a discovered attack with my rook on c7.} Rd7 {He defends.} 25. Qd4 {Trying to pin the Knight on f6 down.} Ne7 26. Be5 Neg8 27. Rfe1 Rh7 28. Nf4 Qh6 29. Qc3 {Another move attacking c7. } Ne8 {He defends it furter.} 30. h3 {If he captures my pawn, I recapture with my bishop and pin his rook on d7.} f6 {He smartly decides not to.} 31. Bd4 Kb8 32. h4 {I make a closed pawn formation, stopping his pawns' advance.} Rhe7 {This move signals his future attacks on my e4 pawn, a weak square now.} 33. Be3 {My last move here looks for a discovered attack on his Queen. I failed to realize that I am preventing my rook from defending my e4 pawn, and that will cause this game to open up very quickly.} Qh7 {Another attack on the e4 square.} 34. Ne2 Nd6 {Yet again, he attacks my e4 pawn.} 35. Nd4 {I threated a fork on c6, but his bishop can simply capture my knight if I were to do so.} Nxe4 {He captures my pawn, and we are even. Thankfully, I am able to use this move to take the initiative, and put a lot of pressure on him.} 36. Nc6+ {I check his king.} Bxc6 {His bishop captures.} 37. Qxc6 {I position my queen in a very threatening location.} Rd6 38. Qc4 {He threatens my queen, so retreat and threated his a6 pawn.} f5 {He defends his knight, I and believe that this move cost him the game. b5 would have served him better.} 39. Qxa6 {I capture, and threated mate with Qb7, eventually.} Ngf6 40. Bg5 {I try for a pin, but instead I commit a minor blunder and lose a pawn.} Nxg5 41. hxg5 Nxd5 42. g6 {This move is vital- If he is to capture with his queen, his rook on e7 is undefended. He cannot use his knight to recapture, because then I mate with Qb7.} Rxe1+ 43. Rxe1 Qxg6 {He avoids the blunder and comes out a pawn up.} 44. a4 {I again seek to move his knight, and attack the pawns defending his king.} c6 {Defends his knight.} 45. Qc4 Kb7 46. Bxd5 {Another important move. He can't recapture with either his rook or pawn, because both lead to mating patterns. See if you can figure them out.} Qf6 47. Bg2 Rd7 48. a5 b5 {His move here was another blunder. His pawn on c6 is pinned by my bishop, and so it cannot recapture.} 49. Qxb5+ Kc8 50. Re8+ Rd8 51. Bxc6 Qf7 52. Rxd8+ Kxd8 {I've traded rooks, and all I need to do now is trade Queens, because I have two passed pawns.} 53. Qb8+ Ke7 54. a6 Qe6 {This move sets up my trade.} 55. Qe8+ Kf6 56. Qxe6+ Kxe6 57. a7 {He can't get to the pawn in time, and so my opponent resigns. This was a particularly tactical match, with an intriguing beginning, and I hope you have enjoyed it.}
