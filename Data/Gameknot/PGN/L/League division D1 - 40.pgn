1. e4 {standard opening yet again} g6 {he prefers to avoid the center-board opening and just frees up his bishop and sets up f7-f5} 2. d3 {i protect the free-floating and free up my black bishop to prevent his uncontested move to h6} Bg7 {he goes to g7 instead, bringing the bishop into play and avoiding a piece trade - he has a good attacking position if i forget myself and move that c1 bishop out anytime soon} 3. Nf3 {bringing out the knight} d6 {freeing the other bishop and protecting some more row 5 real estate} 4. Be2 {setting up the castling, nothing more, though that bishop may be useful later} Nf6 {and he sets up the castle as well, though his position on that side is potentially a little flawed} 5. O-O {i castle} O-O {and he follows suit} 6. c4 {now that the king's tucked away, time to set up a bit more aggressive pawn structure} b6 {he keeps staggering his pawns to prevent any further decisive advance} 7. b4 {and i keep moving forward for the attack - so far he's maintaining a defensive position while i try to set up an advance} Bb7 {moving the bishop out, potentially to cut some holes in those forward ranks if he gets a chance} 8. Na3 {the knight goes out to protect some pawn positions and free up that rook to set up shop on an open rank eventually} a6 {defending against the knight coming in, which i wouldn't have gained much from anyway} 9. b5 {offering the first piece trade} Nxe4 {but he declines, sacrificing a knight in order to cut some holes in my pawn structure. he also gets a bonus that i missed at first, which is that his bishop at g7 attacks the rook, and if i moved it to b1, he'd have me forked with the queen and i'd lose the bishop anyway} 10. dxe4 {sure enough, i take the knight} Bxa1 {and he grabs my rook without a problem} 11. Bh6 {this allows me to attack his rook while freeing up my queen to take care of his own bishop} Bg7 {but he solves both problems in one move by darting quickly back into place} 12. Bxg7 {so i settle for a bishop exchange that will at least force his king out of hiding a bit} Kxg7 {he takes it and i'm down 3 points in materials} 13. Qc2 {now that i've lost one rook, time to at least free the other} axb5 {he finally takes that pawn trade} 14. Qb2+ {and since the knight is now unprotected i decide to use a check to give me some breathing room to jockey for position} Kg8 {he gets out of check and back to safety} 15. Nxb5 {and i get the knight out of danger and into action} Bxe4 {he finally takes that unprotected pawn that's been sitting there through all this, and gets his bishop into good attacking position} 16. Ng5 {time to chase off the bishop } Bc6 {so he flees to where he can do another piece trade if he wants it} 17. Qb3 {while i'm setting the queen for an assault on the king's hiding spot back there} e5 {finally his queen is free to join the action, and considering how much damage he's done without her, that can't be good} 18. Qg3 {protects that knight at g5, and with one more move i could be in a position for mate unless he notices} f6 {which he probably does, and decides to chase off the knight from its annoying perch} 19. Ne6 {but in doing so he's missed that he could lose a rook to this fork, a first little mistake for him} Qe7 {the queen ducks out of danger} 20. Nxf8 {and i grab that rook, sacrificing the knight} Qxf8 {and that's that, the exchanges have quieted down and it's once again my prerogative to go on the attack} 21. Nxc7 {so i take away the possibility of a fruitless bishop/knight exchange, and eliminate the linchpin in his pawn structure, forcing his rook to move too} Rxa2 {that was easy to predict, and now he's forcing me to get my bishop out of danger too} 22. Bd3 {which i do} e4 {he goes on the attack again} 23. Bb1 {and i move in on his rook} Rd2 {he moves the rook out of danger and protects the d6 pawn, which he doubtless intends to move into a fast and furious piece exchange at d5} 24. Qb3 {so i provide some reinforcements for that exchange} Nd7 {and so does he, assuming he can move to e5 on the next turn} 25. c5+ {but things get a little disrupted here - he's in check and his pawn structure is threatened some more} Qf7 {he realizes the threat and opts for a queen exchange so he can keep his edge} 26. Qxf7+ {the only possible wise decision is to accept, and i do} Kxf7 {so he completes the exchange} 27. cxd6 {now i've got a pawn exchange situation, and i opt for the d file since that gets his rook back out of my bottom rows for now} Rxd6 {and his rook completes the exchange} 28. Re1 {i shore up the e file, which could let me gain both a bishop and a pawn from an exchange} f5 {but he adds backup too} 29. Ba2+ {so i abandon the pawn and attack his king, hoping i can get at that back row somehow and use that abandoned knight to keep things moving} Kf6 {happily, he obliges with a perfect fork for my knight - it's been sitting back there so long he's probably neglecting it in his calculations} 30. Ne8+ {but i haven't forgotten and now he's out a rook} Ke7 {he moves to make sure he'll at least take my knight in return} 31. Nxd6 {and i follow through} Kxd6 {and so does he - now, from a position of relative strength, he's blown his advantage and evened things up in terms of material - he's also left his back rows completely open to my bishop, which can dart in and try to disrupt the pawn structure a bit} 32. Rd1+ {but first, a check to keep his king moving and get my rook out into the open} Ke5 {he doges away} 33. Rc1 {and i challenge the bishop to get him moving} Nc5 {a nice move to block me for now} 34. Rd1 {so i get back on the open file} b5 {and he sets in motion a play for promotion} 35. Rd8 {now, finally, into the back rows to start dismantling things} b4 {he advances again, threatening my bishop} 36. Rh8 {so i challenge the base of his pawn structure} h5 {and he responds with an advance} 37. Rg8 {another challenge to the new base} Kf6 {and he fortifies it} 38. Rc8 {attacking his bishop and stacking up so he has to lose at least one piece, but it's something of an empty threat for the moment considering his likely next move } b3 {which is of course to attack my bishop and threaten promotion} 39. Bb1 {so this move gets me out of harm's way, and staves off any credible promotion threats for a bit - meanwhile, he's now going to lose either a bishop or a knight, and he knows it, so my threat carries some force after all} Bd5 {he decides he'd rather lose the knight apparently} 40. Rxc5 {so i oblige him and give myself the decisive edge} Ke5 {now the king's going to try and come in and scare me off} 41. Rc8 {so i head back for the back row} Kf4 {he's apparently dodging my prospective check, but it's not a great move otherwise} 42. Rd8 {especially since his bishop can now be easily threatened again} Bc4 {forcing him to move out of the danger} 43. Rd4 {but it's a short-lived relief, and i continue to chase him} Be2 {another flight} 44. f3 {and now he'd have to doom his bishop to get that pawn} Ke3 {instead he threatens my rook and frees up the pawn to attack} 45. Rd6 {so i head for the back of the pawn structure again} exf3 {and he grabs my offered pawn, things are looking up for him again, with my king increasingly hemmed in by his assault} 46. gxf3 {grab his pawn before it can do real damage} Bxf3 {and he grabs mine} 47. Rxg6 {finally, i get to grab that linchpin pawn, leaving him with just 3 free-floating pawns and me with one tucked over in the corner but for now untouchable} Be4 {he protects the f5 pawn, which is his one good chance to advance to promotion at the moment} 48. Bxe4 {so i take the offered exchange} Kxe4 {and he grabs my bishop - now my very slim advantage is one rook balanced against some very well-positioned pawns and an active king} 49. Rb6 {so i decide to eliminate the most decisive threat, with no hope of him escaping} f4 {he gives up the b pawn and advances along f} 50. Rxb3 {grabbing the b pawn, i also seal off his king from moving down any further, so his f pawn will also have to be abandoned sooner or later too. this is the crucial maneuver he's missed} f3 {the pawn advances} 51. Kf2 {but my king cuts it off and there's nothing else he can do. i've got his last viable pawn, and after this i'd easily be able to seal him off, take the last pawn, and advance my last pawn for an easy rook/queen combo mate. he can do little but resign}
