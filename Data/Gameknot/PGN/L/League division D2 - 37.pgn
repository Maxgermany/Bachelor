1. d4 {this is a gd example of a battling game with a solid black defense against an expanding white attack} Nf6 {in this game i play the kings for indian my first time playing it although it wont be the last after a thoroughly intresting game} 2. c4 {taking control of the squares on the queen side on the quenn} g6 {preparing the finachetto and the bishop on the long h8-a1 diagoal} 3. Nc3 {increasing control on queen side} Bg7 {the sniper is ready} 4. e4 {oh no what have i done from general maxims white has taken complete control of the center} d6 {i need a diagonal for my light bishop} 5. Be3 {a bit suspect i would hace developed king knite} O-O {theres no way your attacking  my king soon} 6. Qd2 {? dont really see point in this move. i guess ts peparing a king  side castle but with all those wholes he doesnt want to do that. much better would have been to force the issue with f4} Nbd7 {i didnt want to move my night t c6 because it would be esily harrased by advancing pawns. and i needed to develop pieces. however i had my eyes set on moving the other bishop to b7 so i was not worried about the loss of the diagonal} 7. f4 {at last a moveof intent notice his whole king side is underveloped} b6 {preparing the bishop} 8. h3 {not another pawn coming my way  expecting g4} Bb7 9. Bd3 {at last king side is developing but look how many wholes there are and oppurtunities for me. as my defence is solid} c5 {at last i try to grab some space but... } 10. d5 {this shuts down the queens bishops diaagonal but weekens the e5 square} e6 {i try to remove the d pawn } 11. Nf3 {right now you feel i firework is raring to go off someway or another as all pieces are developed} Re8 {?! hoping to give support to my e pawn also it is attacking enemy king which is crucial later on} 12. g4 {not another one} Kh8 {needed to give my knight some where to go to if e5} 13. e5 {the exchange begins} dxe5 14. fxe5 Ng8 {thers the space 4 u knite} 15. Ng5 {uh oh a royal fork mate on f7 cant be havin that} Nxe5 {now a royal fork of my own on f3 after h6} 16. Be4 {? stops nite moving to to f three but unguarded c pawn a mistake castling may be better} h6 {that nite still needed to be removed} 17. Nf3 {leave the knite take the pawn} Nxc4 18. Qf2 {mm lets move the queen in front of the king} Nxe3 19. Qxe3 {gd nw lets clear the path for the rook} exd5 20. O-O-O {!O-O-O  wasnt expecting that i thought i won a piece} Nf6 {haha that should sort him out} 21. g5 {bit worried about possibilities of gxhsix but felt confident enough} Nxe4 {piece up} 22. Nxe4 Rxe4 {here my opponent resigned > this is a good example of how the kings indian should work for a battling player and how a solid defense and a good counter attack can be succesful in a very enjoyable game i hop$e you have enjoyed and please post comments with any advice }
