[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C80), open, Riga variation"]

1. e4 {I've annotated this game simply because it was my first in Gameknot (i.e. there's nothing to recommend the game), and done so without the aid of a computer, so there are likely flaws in the analysis.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Morphy's defence, the main line of the Ruy Lopez. I believe the logic is that it forces White into an early decision without losing a tempo, and is also the first move of a possible queenside pawn advance.} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O {Still in the main line of the Ruy Lopez. Black can and does capture on e4 (the Open/Tarrasch Defense), but White gets very good chances by attacking on the e-file.} Nxe4 6. d4 {Better than the immediate Re1, d4 tries to open the e-file and develops the Bc1.} exd4 7. Re1 f5 {?! Here we leave the "World" database, but not the Gameknot database. 7... f5 is tempting because 7... d5 pins the Nc6, but after 8. Nxd4, f5 is attacked, and a route to the Black king has been opened.} 8. Nxd4 Nxd4 {The most popular line in the Gameknot database is 8... Qh4 9. g3 Qf6 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. f3 Bc5+ 12. Kg2 O-O 13. fxe4 fxe4 where White is up a piece for two pawns but Black has a dangerous looking attack. The game move is probably prioritising material; I have no idea which is better.} 9. Qxd4 Be7 {Be7 is thematic in the Ruy Lopez, protecting the king against pins while allowing castling. Here, the g7 pawn is too important to lose. But does Black have anything better?} 10. Qxg7 Bf6 {A natural forcing move, although the knight is re-pinned. 10. Rf8 is also worth considering.} 11. Qh6 Bd4 {? Black now seems to be lost, even at my lower standard. The threat on f2 is an illusion after 12. Qh5+ and 13. Qxf5, whereas Black has opened the h4-d8 diagonal for White's bishop without doing any thing to activate pieces such as Rh8 and Bc7. Better options include 11... c6 and 11... Rf8.} 12. Qh5+ Ke7 13. Qxf5 d5 {Protecting the knight and attacking the queen, but even that's not enough.} 14. Bg5+ {Missing 14. Rxe4+! fxe4 15. Bg5+ Kd6 16. Qf4+ Be5 17. Qd2+ winning the queen, but the game line is good enough.} Kd6 15. Qf4+ {This little manoeuvre gets Black's king back on the e-file.} Be5 16. Qxe5+ Kxe5 17. Bxd8 Rxd8 18. f3 {White is satisfied for the gain of a knight from the attack.} c5 19. c3 {Not 19. fxe4? b5 20. Bb3 c4, trapping the bishop. Credit to Black for resigning now when some would have played on hoping (not unrealistically) for a blunder from White. }
