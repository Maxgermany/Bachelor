1. d4 d5 2. c4 {This really is my first serious attempt at one of the Queen's Gambit openings.} e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 Bb4 5. Bg5 O-O 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Bd3 dxc4 8. Bxc4 Be7 9. Qc2 a6 10. e4 b5 11. Bd3 Bb7 12. e5 Nd5 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 14. Bxh7+ {This is a pattern I've seen that seems to be fairly common in Queen's Gambit games. To be fair, those I saw (by the Grandmasters) were engineered sacrifices. In this case, I was just being greedy and taking an opportunity to puncture a hole in his defense and grabbing that pawn. You will see that my followup leaves much to be desired.} Kh8 15. Bd3 {I am not too sure about this move. I think Be4 might have been better.} Nxc3 16. Qxc3 {I was not too comfortable about that lone pawn on the a-file that I'd create had I chosen 16. bxc3.} c5 17. O-O {This move caused me a lot of trouble with my king's safety later.} Bxf3 {there we go.} 18. gxf3 Rac8 19. f4 {Was trying to temporarily prevent 19. ...,Qg5+ while providing additional support to my e pawn. 18. ..., Rac8 seems to be an attempt to undermine that pawn (as far as I can tell).} Qh4 {Swooping in and threatening 20. ..., Qxf4. Thankfully the black Queen is still without any serious support for attacking my King yet. I could smell trouble though ... his knight could eventually win passage.} 20. dxc5 Qxf4 21. b4 Nxe5 {I had to be prepared to throw one pawn away and I had to decide which. All this while, I had hoped for an opportunity to execute a "cheap" trick of Bc2 followed by Qd3 for a mate threat. Of course, against a player of this caliber, he'd have seen it miles away.} 22. Be2 {I think Be2 was my attempt to prevent his Knight from freely advancing toward my King. That turned out to be a blessing in disguise later because it was then able to get into a position to hold off a very scary attack.} Rfd8 23. Rad1 {I felt I had to challenge the file. My a Rook was otherwise useless and he's obviously intent on moving pieces for the attack. In any case, 23. ...,Rxd1 would grant me tentative control of the file while I scramble to defend my King.} Ng4 {Ouchie. 24. Bxg4 would cost me a Rook.} 24. Qh3+ {So, thank goodness for the availability of this move.} Nh6 25. a3 {This is a rather curious move considering the world of pain I was in at this point. I think I was not enthused with either Qxb4 or an eventual Rxb4 as a matter of his moving forces in to threaten the King. 25. a3 was my way of securing that pawn chain because it was way harder for him to assault the 3rd rank than the 4th. I think I just wanted to put this out of my mind and focus on King defense. Of course, I had to try to make sure there were no observable threats to the King over the next 2-3 moves.} Kg8 26. Rd3 {I think my intention was to double the rooks for an attack. It also brings some defensive capabilities to the g file should I need some.} Rxd3 27. Qxd3 {I think here, I was hoping beyond hope to somehow put the bishop behind the Queen so I could win a Rook should I play it right and the opponent plays it poorly. A fool's wish, really.} e5 28. Qd7 {I think I noticed his Rook really didn't have anywhere useful to go if I did this. It gave me an opportunity to push the c pawn (which I did) and also positioned my Queen to defend the g4 square. Ng4 would open my King for a mate threat (possibly indefensible too).} Rf8 29. c6 f5 {This was nasty ... my Queen just got blocked off. I considered continuing the pawn push (if I got to c7, my opponent would have to lose a rook and suffer a check at the same time). However, it was clear if I attempted that, he could easily engineer a perpetual check if he desired a draw.  Seriously though, given my situation, I was tempted to let him.} 30. Qd5+ {But nooo ... I got a little stubborn. Checked him to gain some tempo to try to salvage the situation. I wasn't sure what I was going to do at this point I think.} Kh7 31. f3 {This move was rather vexing for me. The goal was to prevent Ng4. I could do that in a variety of ways given the two pawns and my queen. In choosing this, I had hoped to continue supporting my c pawn's promotion using my queen and I had to consider how to react if he pushed his e pawn.} Qe3+ 32. Rf2 {The only move that could save my poor dangling bishop. And I just walked into a pin. Things certainly did not look so good now. Things seemed tentatively safe when I studied this position though. One of my options was to drop the bishop, which would probably have cost me the game.} Rf6 33. Bf1 {"Un-dangle" my bishop while at the same time preparing to move it up to g2 to tentatively serve as a pawn. My opponent seemed to be gunning for 33. ...,Rg6+ 34. Kf1,Qc1+ 35. Qd1, Qxd1+ 36. Bxd1,Rxc6 and costing me my pass pawn while setting his own up for possible promotion.} Rg6+ 34. Bg2 Qe1+ 35. Rf1 {This formation was surprisingly resilient with all sorts of slight modifications that afforded the same protection depending on what was being threatened.} Qe3+ 36. Kh1 Qe2 37. Bh3 {This was one of those modifications I talked about earlier. When I vacate the spot, a vulnerable square (g2) stopped becoming vulnerable (until he piled more forces on it). This observation was actually quite fascinating for me.} Ng8 {This *might* be a mistake on his part. Seriously, I was wondering if I should offer a draw and pray he accepts. Essentially, I think he was gunning for my pass pawn. The move kinda surprised me because I was furiously thinking about how to deal with 37. ...,e4 which undermines my f pawn defense while exposing his own f-pawn for a possible attack by my queen. The other thing I was very worried about was an attack on my now vulnerable a pawn from his Queen.} 38. c7 {I wasn't gonna let that pawn sit there to die.} Ne7 39. Qf7 {Trying to force his knight from preventing c8. He, thankfully, does not appear to have a way to defend his knight. Notice my bishop is effectively limited to h3 or g2. Qxf1# is the threat.} Nc8 40. Qxf5 {I felt some relieve at this point, pinning the rook and threatening the Knight.} Nd6 41. c8=Q Nxc8 42. Qxc8 {Felt a great pressure lift from my shoulders after this. I was still not out of the woods, my King's position is best described to be tenuous. } Rf6 43. Bg2 {This is what I mean by the beauty of this formation!} Rg6 44. Rg1 {Without the Knight, I felt it safer to huddle in while I find a way to extricate myself out of this tight(er) spot.} Qf2 {I'm not sure what he intended to do with this move. I was almost certain he was gonna attack my queen-side pawns.} 45. Qf5 {Re-establish the pin while threatening the e pawn so I can buy myself some room.} Qd4 {Qe3 might probably have been better.} 46. Rf1 {His Queen's current position prevents me from moving the bishop to some more useful position with Qxg1#.} Qh4 {He might be trying to unpin the Rook (takes more than 1 move, I think) and then go for Rh6.} 47. Qxe5 {I figured I'd unpin it for him and remove that annoying pawn and protecting the h pawn at the same time so even if he did Rh6, it would not achieve anything. My key worry now was denying him a chance at perpetual check.} Qc4 48. Qe4 {Re-establishing the pin and offering an exchange of queens. I was trying to simplify and allow my bishop to be useful again. Notice his queen-side pawns are on white squares which are perfect targets.} Qxe4 {He takes the exchange. I think he's counting on reducing me to just the King and Bishop and hence a draw.} 49. fxe4 a5 {This was unexpected. I was expecting Rc6 or Rd6 to get to a position to attack the a pawn. The offered exchange is really a trap. It is MUCH better for me if I made him take the exchange than for me to take this exchange right now.} 50. e5 {I had to check that it was safe to push this pawn. There were two goals, the first was to get it close enough to be a threat and the second was to free my bishop.} axb4 {Again, unexpected. I had to think very carefully at this point. He had opened himself up for a Rook for Bishop exchange and I had to make sure his advanced b pawn was not going to be a problem.} 51. Be4 bxa3 52. Bxg6+ Kxg6 {In the end, it was clear. His King was prevented from reaching my e pawn. The e pawn promotes LATER than the a pawn, BUT puts him in check, allowing me to recapture the queen with no loss. Any attempt to move his King to deny this check would then make his promotion later than mine, also losing the game.} 53. e6 {Given how seriously pressured I was in the middle of this game and also in another game where I played the Queen's Gambit, I do not think I'd be trying this opening for a while ...}
