1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Bg5 Bf5 {Developing the problem bishop early.} 4. Nbd2 {White decides to take a modern approach to the game. The advantage of Nd2 is that white can still play c4 with support from the knight and bishop.} Nbd7 5. e3 e6 {supporting d5 and openning up lines for the dark bishop.} 6. c4 Be7 {we now have transposed into the QGD mainline with Be7.} 7. Be2 {if white had played 7. cxd5 then ...exd5 would have lead to the exchange varation of the QGD} h6 8. Bxf6 Nxf6 {it is better to capture with the knight because the bishop is more powerful on e7. From e7 it can support the main counter attack via ...c5} 9. O-O c6 10. Re1 O-O 11. a3 Qc7 {It will be hard for white to defend on the dark squares with the absence of his dark bishop. This is the consequence of trading his bishop for my knight.} 12. Rc1 {putting the rook on the half open c file in anticipation of it being opened completely soon.} a5 {preventing white from grabbing more space on the queenside via b4.} 13. cxd5 exd5 {Black has done well in the openning and has come out of it with an approximate equality. } 14. Ne5 {A nice advanced post of the Knight. This attacks black weakest link on c6.} Bd6 15. Ndf3 {Defends the knight on e5} Bh7 16. Bd3 Ne4 {to trade bishops would be better for white. Now if white wishs to trade then e4 will belong to me.} 17. Bb1 {My knight on e4 is dominating the position. } Rfe8 18. h3 a4 {stunning whites queenside and limiting the developing squares for the Queen.} 19. Bc2 Qa5 {defends a5 and putting the queen on a more active square.} 20. Re2 Qa6 21. Bd3 Qa7 22. Rec2 f6 {attacking the poor knight who has no good retreating squares.} 23. Nd7 b6 {my position has deterated in the last few moves. My queenside pawns are a bit messy} 24. Nxf6+ Nxf6 25. Bxh7+ Kxh7 {white stands better. } 26. Rc2xc6 Rad8 27. Qd3+ Ne4 28. Qb5 {If I were white I should be happy but lets see if black has an ace up his sleave.} Qd7 {does this drop another pawn?} 29. Qxa4 {White seems to think so} Re6 {! This was my plan. I played ...Qd7 which pins the rook to the queen and helps lift the rook to g6 where it will create massive pressure on the weak king.} 30. Qc2 Rf8 {White has won the battle for the c-file but it is of little use for him. My pieces are all mounting an offensive against the king.} 31. b4 Rg6 {black has multiple threats like ...Qxh3 ...Bh2  } 32. Kf1 {the king is getting a bit scared!} Rgf6 33. Ke2 Qf7 {threatening to take the knight with a decisive advantage} 34. Rxb6 Rg6 35. Rg1 Bh2 {I win the g pawn and white's back has been broken} 36. Rxg6 Qxg6 37. Rh1 Qxg2 38. Rxh2 Qxf3+ 39. Ke1 Qf5 40. f4 Rc8 41. Qd1 Rc3 42. Qg4 Rc1+ 43. Ke2 Nc3+ {}
