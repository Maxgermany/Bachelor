1. e4 b6 {This opening called Owens defenes the main idea of this vriation is to attacks white center with the moves like Bb7 Nd7 e5 and solong . } 2. d4 Ba6 {maybe 2... Bb7 was the best move because black gives white immediately space center advantage} 3. Bxa6 Nxa6 4. Qe2 Qc8 5. Nf3 g6 6. Nc3 Bh6 {the same idea. it  don't look so good for black Na6 Nh6 innit ?!} 7. Bxh6 Nxh6 8. Qd2 {8. h3 was better move I think , the idea is to avoid moves like Ng4 Nf6 and in case of caste-ling there is a window for the white king . but 8 . Qe2 is controlling the dark squares  and attend to move to h6 and attack the h6 f8 diagonal that the dark square bishop was defending it .} Ng8 9. O-O d6 10. e5 {White attended to use the center advantage and space that it has , and wishes to open the D and E liens for the rooks . It have another option to move the white Knight  on e4 g3or g5 in the future .} dxe5 11. dxe5 f6 12. Rfe1 fxe5 13. Nxe5 Qd8 {because of the large advantage for the white in the center , black wishes to exchange the queens, and trays to control the D-line by Rd8 in the future .} 14. Qf4 {Great move now the white now winning the game the best move to avoid the mate on f7 is 14....Nf6 ( 14.....Qc8,Qd6 or Qd8 will be .15.Qf7+Kd8.16. Qg7 and the blacks Rooke is traped ) 15. Qa4+ and winning the knight on a6 !} Nf6 15. Qa4+ {Black is completely lost now . (16.Qa4!!was much stronger)} Kf8 16. Qxa6 Qc8 17. Qc4 a5 18. Qf7# {}
