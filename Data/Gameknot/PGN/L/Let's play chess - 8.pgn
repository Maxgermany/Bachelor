[Opening "Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45)"]

1. d4 {This is my first annotated game, so I would welcome any feedback. I am a fan of the Torre attack* and in this game I hope to bring out some of its general principles as well as a few of my own touches. Although wikipedia suggests that the Torre is not particularly advantageous for White, Nigel Short** categorises it as a good opening, describing it as a very handy and easy-to-learn system and says that White can play the first three moves no matter what Blacks set-up.  * Late Edit: Because of the move order, strictly speaking, this is the Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45) rather than the Torre.  ** Nigel Short on Chess. Hamlyn 1989. } Nf6 2. Bg5 e6 3. Nf3 Be7 4. Nbd2 O-O 5. e3 {Short said that the Torre has the advantage of exposing White to very little risk because of his solid central pawns on c3, d4 and e3, hence this move. It also gives access for the LSB (light square bishop) to land on d3, so that it can snipe at h7, handy for a King hunt.} d5 6. Bd3 h6 7. Bh4 b6 8. c3 {Completing the solid pawn structure. This move could be described as passive and perhaps rightly so, but White came out intending to play the Torre and the Torre it is (so there!)} c5 {An excellent and well favoured move by Black, this usually sharpens the play.} 9. Rc1 {Now my personal touches, warts and all, are coming in! Whites thinking was that if there is a pawn exchange, there will be a nice channel for his rook or should Black advance his pawn to c4, Whites LSB can find a good home on b1 as a long range sniper while not trapping in that rook on a1.} c4 {Sure enough.} 10. Bb1 b5 11. Bxf6 {This exchange means that the knight no longer defends the critical h7 square, the area where White is trying to exert pressure.} Bxf6 12. Qc2 {Black did not earn his good rating by falling for simple threats like this; Whites hope was purely to force Black to weaken his own pawn structure in his Kings Castle; it is difficult for me to see how he could avoid doing so.} g6 13. h4 {Trying to put more pressure on the vulnerable Castle.} Bg7 {A good consolidating defensive move and frees his f pawn.  } 14. h5 {Continuing with the theme.} Qf6 {Seems to make sense to me.} 15. g4 Nd7 16. Ke2 {Never mind castling, White wants to keep the initiative, so his majesty can jump up and his rook can fly underneath him. In situations like this the rapid mobilisation of forces is all.} Re8 17. Rcg1 Nf8 {I think perhaps if Black had played g5 instead, either now or at some other close  opportune moment, White would never have looked so clever after all, it would have locked things up a bit.} 18. g5 Qf5 {I fully understand this move, Black needs to take the sting out of his opponents attack and a good way to do that is to swap Queens; I too would have been minded so, but} 19. Qd1 {Her majesty does not have to engage her peer, she can simply step aside and let the shy LSB face the music. Blacks Queen has nowhere to run. Black, an honourable opponent, resigns on the spot.  If you are still awake, I hope you enjoyed my first stab at an annotation, all feedback is welcome.  Tim. }
