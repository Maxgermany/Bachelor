1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 d6 {While not entirely sold on the French-style defense, I like it against the Three Knights opening as it frees the QN quickly.} 4. Bc4 {Threatening pressure on the KBP.  This move is weaker than 3. Bc4 as an attacking move since Black's QB is now free, but just fine for development.} Nf6 {Ensuring that all remains safe on the home front.} 5. d3 {Castle first and wait?  The mirrored pawns cut off the KB.} g6 {Departing a touch from standard play.  I am not a huge fan of the Be7 move except against early bishop pressure.  I started experimenting with the fiancetto recently however so still don't have solid timing developing it.} 6. Be3 {Prepares to advance the QP?} Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. Qe2 {Look, I'm just saying, I think this wastes the move.  The alternative 8. d4 attack opens up the middle nicely for White, who has movement with his rooks.} Qe7 {Probably Black should move out the bishop first, possibly with exchange to weaken White's knight pressure.  However, this proves useful...} 9. Nd5 Nxd5 10. exd5 Nd8 {If 10. ... Nb4 11. c3 Na6 and the Knight is sidelined, with 12. Bxa6 bxa6 doubling the edge pawns - yech.  Not that the current position is much better.} 11. d4 {I prefer 11. c3 first both to back up this pawn advance and give the Bishop a flight square.} b6 {Preparing for Bb7 to pressure the advanced QP.} 12. Bg5 Qd7 {12. ... Bf6 and the consequent exchange sacrifices the fiancettoed position.  This is cramped though.} 13. Bb5 Qf5 14. Rad1 {A curious time to move the Rook.} e4 {Ensures that White's QP remains doubled with threat of Qxd5 winning the pawn eventually.  Unfortunately White's black Bishop gets free reign...} 15. Be7 exf3 {Queen exchange, or lose the Knight outright as moving the Queen gives Black time to move the Rook.} 16. Qxf3 Qxf3 17. gxf3 {Incidentally doubles another pawn.} Bb7 {Threatening the QP.} 18. c4 {(Just take the Rook already.)} a6 19. Bd7 f6 20. Bxf8 Kxf8 {So that was all an overly complicated exchange.  The two bishops combined with the doubled pawn may give Black an advantage.} 21. Rfe1 Nf7 22. Re4 Rd8 23. Be6 Ng5 24. Rh4 {Whoops.} Nxf3+ 25. Kg2 Nxh4+ 26. Kg3 Nf5+ 27. Kf4 Bh6+ 28. Ke4 Ng7 {}
