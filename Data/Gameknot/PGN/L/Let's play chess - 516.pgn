[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {I played 3.Nf3 expecting ...Nc6 4.Bb5 Ruy Lopez} f6 {Greeted with 3. ...f6 Damiano's defence I was surprised  and looked into the Game database to see what common replies were.} 3. Nxe5 fxe5 4. Qh5+ {This situation was one I had been in as black before. I was black and my opponent played Kings gambit  which I had never faced before and played it like I would play Queens gambit by moving the bishops pawn forward d1. e4 e5 2. f4 f6 3.fxe5 fxe5 4.Qh5+ } Ke7 {I had expected ... g6 so I could play 5. Qxe5+ Ne7 6. Qxh8 but was greeted with 5. Ke7.} 5. Qxe5+ Kf7 6. Bc4+ Kg6 7. Qf5+ Kh6 8. d4+ g5 {This part of the game was forced and when I saw this move I needed a plan. } 9. h4 {I realised that 9. h4 would mean I should be able to play 10.hxg5+ Kg7 11. Qf7#  I saw no other move that could extend the game } Bb4+ {However I was wrong I didn't see 9.Bb4+ but this could only make the game last for a couple more moves} 10. c3 {I played 10.c3 expecting10. ...  Bxc3 to extend the game.} Be7 {10. ... Be7 adding more defenders ti the g-pawn was what I had expected on move 9. This move did nothing but mean the game would end in two more moves because my opponent had overlooked that 11. hxg5+ was actually a double check with both rook and pawn which.} 11. hxg5+ {Mate next move} Kg7 12. Qf7# {What I learned from this game  1. Damiano's defence is a weak opening. 2. (Combined with my experience of 1.e4 e5 2. f4 f6 3. fxe5 fxe5 4. Qh5+ g6 5.Qxe5+) f6 is generally a weak move against kings pawn game  }
