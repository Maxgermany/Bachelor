[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C89), Marshall counter-attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez. White aims to keep long term pressure with the pin on the black knight. } a6 {Questioning the bishop. Bxc6 dxc6 nxe5 does not win a pawn after Qd4. Even Bxc6 cxd6 nxe5 Qg5 is playable. } 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O {Main line Ruy Lopez. } 8. c3 {Classical way to play with d4, trying to gain the center. Although c3 allows the Marshall Attack, and thus if white does not want to play against the Marshall he can play several antimarshall variations: mainly a4 or h3} d5 {The Marshall Attack. A strong pawn sacrifice. } 9. Bxd5 {? Just wrong. The main line exd5 nxd5 nxe5 rxe5 bd6 qh4 g3 qh3 offers black attacking chances, but both sides have to play carefully and black is down a pawn. This line just gives black the advantages of the Marshall without the downside (the gambit of the e pawn)} Nxd5 10. exd5 Qxd5 {Black enjoys a spacial advantage, a lead in development, and attacking chances.} 11. d4 {?! Questionable as this encourages the pawn advance 11. e4! with a nice edge to black} e4 {The black pawn now becomes an important part} 12. Ne5 {? This just loses a pawn. There are not many good alternatives though, as Nfd2 hinders white's development even more.} Nxe5 13. dxe5 Qxe5 14. Be3 Bd6 {Threatens mate on h7. Forcing a weakness in the white castle position. } 15. g3 Qf5 {! Eyes the classic weak h3 square in the Marshall Gambit along with stopping any white ideas of f3. } 16. Nd2 Bb7 {A move that is different from the normal Marshall. Normally the Black Queen is on h3 and the black LSB is on g4, setting up nice mating nets. Here though Qh3 drops a pawn, so deploying the bishop along the a8 h1 diagonal seems effective. } 17. Nb3 {?! Another questionable move. Trying to drive the queen away from f5, but Black wants to play Qh3 anyways. } Rae8 {Black develops the rook to support the e pawn and possibly prepares a rook lift. } 18. Nd4 Qh3 19. a4 {? Another move asking for trouble. Black has a powerful attack and white is trying to win a queenside pawn that is useless. } Re5 {Now Black threatens Rh5 with a nearly unstoppable mate on h5. } 20. g4 {Stopping the rook from moving to h5, but opening up the b8 h2 diagonal. } Rg5 {! Great move rips open the Kingside. Black threatens the simple and brutal Rxg4. The rook cannot be taken as is shown in the game. } 21. Bxg5 {?? This ends the game. Black still had a large lead and a very dangerous attack but this loses instantly. } Bxh2+ {! A common mating net in the Marshall Attack. } 22. Kh1 Bg3+ 23. Kg1 Qh2+ {White resigns. As after Kf1 Qxf2#. The game is an example of what the Marshall can do to unsuspecting opponents. White did not grasp the ideas of the position, and quickly got overwhelmed by the strong black attack. Most notable are the ideas of creating weaknesses in the White Kingside using the bishop and queen, and then supporting that attack quickly (ie through a rooklift), and finally the mating net with the bishop and queen, which every Marshall player should know. }
