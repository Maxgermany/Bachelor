[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Scandinavian variation"]

1. e4 {This time with Alekhine's Defence. I've very few, if any problems with dealing with this opening, as I know how to get level on development...} Nf6 2. Nc3 {...and that's bring out my own knight to defend my pawn, moving with the Scandinavian variation. I know what to expect from here...} d5 {...and that's a contested centre, with his queen's pawn coming out to attack my king's pawn. I've experienced this opening before, and I know how to deal with it...} 3. exd5 Nxd5 4. Nxd5 Qxd5 {...and that's to trade first the pawns, then the knights, forcing the queen out. I'm not too worried about her occupying the centre of the board, where she potentially has the most square coverage...} 5. Qf3 {...as I bring mine out to contest the long light diagonal. I'm hoping he'll play 5... Qxf3, so I can bring out my knight to that same square, bringing me ahead on development...} Qe5+ 6. Qe3 {...but he declines the exchange, so I offer it again. I do not place my queen too deep, so she doesn't block my kingside bishop...} Nc6 7. Nf3 {...but he again declines the exchange, bringing out his knight, so I do likewise, attacking his queen. This time, the exchange looks on the cards...} Qxe3+ 8. dxe3 {...and that is exactly what happens. I use my queen's pawn to capture his queen, so I have more pawns connected on the kingside, and my KBP will have more support.} Bg4 9. Be2 {His light-square bishop comes out to attack my knight, so I defend it with mine. This is to maintain a good pawn structure, so then if his bishop captures my knight, I can take back, and my bishop would sit nicely on the third rank...} O-O-O 10. h3 {...but as he castles queenside, bringing his rook into play, I attack the bishop with my rook's pawn...} Bxf3 11. Bxf3 {...and I get the exchange. This was a little dodgy, as he could so easily have played 11... Nb4, eyeing up my pawn on c2, as well as a possible king and rook fork, which would cause me to lose the latter, meaning that to prevent it I would have had to play 12. Bd1, then to castle kingside...} Rd6 12. Bxc6 Rxc6 {...but amazingly, he doesn't, so I can therefore remove his knight in exchange for my bishop, although my remaining pieces are still in their bases. Also, my bishop's pawn is under attack...} 13. c3 {...so I move it up to some protection from its neighbour.} g6 {He's hoping to fianchetto his bishop, as he's moved up the pawn that started in front of the knight next to it...} 14. O-O {...so I castle kingside to bring my own rook into play. I feel that it is slightly safer then castling queenside, as the QRP could be exposed to an attack...} Bg7 {...and, as predicted, he fianchettos his bishop. I should really get another piece into play...} 15. e4 {...so I move up my pawn to give my bishop more room. I'm hoping to place it on e3, to connect my rooks, in order to take command or contest the open d-file...} Rd8 {...and as a rook moves into it, I must now contest it...} 16. Be3 {...so I indeed bring out my bishop to e3, connecting my rooks...} b6 17. Rfd1 {...and I contest the open file, hoping he'll make the first capture, so I'll have control of it...} Rcd6 18. Rxd6 Rxd6 {...but he declines to take mine, so I make the first capture, and he captures, back, taking control of it. I have a Plan B: manoeuvre my king to e2 (to avoid any possible bishop check, even though the pawns on c3 and f2 mean there is no chance of it, then place my rook on d1 to contest the file...} 19. Kf1 h5 20. Ke2 e6 21. Rd1 {...so I do just that, hoping to go in for the dark-square bishop and pawn endgame.} Rc6 {However, he declines to take my rook, although moving his QNP means that he cannot try to loosen up my queenside pawns...} 22. Bd4 {...so I contest the long dark diagonal with my bishop, hoping to exchange, so my rook can come up to the fourth rank, to gain some tempo, as my king is higher up than my opponent's...} Bxd4 23. Rxd4 {...and this is exactly what happens. We now have a single-rook and pawn endgame, with one open file, and I must now find a way to exchange the rooks, with my king better placed...} a5 24. Kd3 {...so I move him up behind my rook, plotting Rc4, as the rook can only move one square across its current rank...} f5 {...but although his KBP attacks my pawn on e4, I am not too worried. If we do exchange rooks on c4, we go into a pawn endgame, and I may end up a pawn down, but while all my six pawns are in single file, connected and strong (three on each side), he'll have doubled pawns on e6 and e4, isolated and weak, with the more advanced pawn disappearing in two moves.} 25. Rc4 {I do indeed offer to exchange rooks...} Rxc4 26. Kxc4 {...and he accepts the exchange, moving into the pawn endgame. Like I said I may end up a pawn down, but the reality is different...} fxe4 {...as he does indeed get doubled isolated pawns on e6 and e4. My king can easily deal with the one on e4...} 27. Kd4 Kd7 28. Kxe4 {...which he does. We both have six pawns apiece, with mine all being connected to one another, and my opponent having one isolated and weak, and a potential target.} c5 29. Ke5 {He should have moved his king forward, instead of advancing his QBP, as my king can now menace the isolated  pawn, and stay high up the board. In this endgame, I like to think of the kings' no-go squares as "mines": mine cannot occupy b4, g4, a5, c5, d5, f5, h5, c6, d6, e6, c7, e7, c8, d8 or e8: my opponent's cannot occupy a3, b3, c3, e3, f3, g3, h3, b4, d4, e4, f4, g4, d5, f5, d6, e6 or f6.} Ke7 {He moves his king in front of his pawn to ensure that mine cannot threaten any of his pawns, but I do have another plot...} 30. h4 {...and that's to blockade his rook's pawn on the kingside. I could now advance my bishop's pawn on the same side one square, then my knight's pawn two, hoping to eventually create a passed pawn on that side of the board, and if the only pawn was mine on the g-file, the king would have to stop it from promoting, allowing mine to eliminate the pawn on e6, then the queenside pawns, then help mine to promotion...} b5 {...but I'm not at all worried about three enemy queenside pawns together on my fifth rank...} 31. b3 {...as I can contest my fourth with my knight's pawn, expecting an exchange...} b4 32. cxb4 axb4 {...and this is exactly what I expected. There's no way my opponent's king can threaten my queenside pawns, as he cannot access a4, b4, c4, d4, d5, d6, e6, f6, g6, g5 or h5, which is like a wall...} 33. f3 {...so I can advance my KBP one rank to help out my knight's pawn. I'm not worried about a pawn advance, as mine can capture instantly...} Kd7 {...but although the king invites mine to attack his pawns on g6 and h5, I am wise to this...} 34. g4 {...as I can now advance my KNP to the 4th rank to help out the other kingside pawns. If he plays 34... g5, I can play 35. gxh5, and if he plays 35... gxh4, my pawn can run to h8, then the queen can capture down the board. If he plays 34... hxg4, I can capture back, and threaten to create a passed pawn, so I could eliminate the pawn on e6, then go for the queenside pawns...} Ke7 {...but the king closes the door for mine...} 35. g5 {...so instead of capturing, which would isolate my kingside pawns, I advance my knight's pawn to get a more powerful hold on f6. His best option is to move the king, as moving the only pawn which can move would mean I'd capture on c4, allowing mine to advance, or my king to menace the isolated pawn on b4...} Kd7 {...so the king moves aside to allow mine through on their side of the board...} 36. Kf6 {...which is exactly what I do: move the king to threaten the kingside pawns on g6, and h5, to allow me to promote my most advanced pawn in five moves...} Kd6 37. Kxg6 Ke5 38. Kxh5 {...and now my king clears the pawns, making mine passed. I'm not worried about my opponent's king going for my pawn on f3, as moving the king to my 4th rank would allow my pawn to advance to g8, and my queen can easily  clean up the remaining pawns...} Kf4 39. g6 Kxf3 40. g7 e5 41. g8=Q {...and so I get my queen. She could easily go d5-c5-b4, and guard the e1 square, and if I do lose her, I could get a replacement.} e4 42. Qd5 Kf4 43. Qxc5 e3 44. Qxb4+ {She cleans up the queenside pawns, as I described previously, and as she checks the king, I could easily get her onto the queening square, and possibly to guard the pawn on a2, where I could easily go for four queens by getting pawns to a8, b8 and h8...} Kf3 45. Qe1 {...but my opponent decides that enough is enough by resigning. I would have so liked to have four queens to get a checkmate.}
