1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c5 4. d5 d6 {A little subtlety I learned from US Chess Championship Live Streams. This way, I will force Nc3 before exchanging on d5, because if he has his Knight on b1 he could immediately decide for Nd2-c4. Why should I let my opponent carry out his plans effortlessly?} 5. Nc3 exd5 {Now that he played Nc3, I can exchange.} 6. cxd5 g6 7. Nd2 Bg7 8. e4 Nbd7 9. Be2 O-O 10. O-O Re8 11. a4 a6 12. f4 Rb8 13. a5 b5 14. axb6 e.p. Nxb6 15. Kh1 c4 16. Nxc4 {Before this move, it was all theory. This capture, however, is not the best try, because at the end of the exchanges I will have an active rook on e4.} Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Nxc4 {Forced, because Rxe4? Na5! and White is much better.} 18. Bxc4 Rxe4 19. Be2 {I was surprised by this move, in my analysis I considered more Re1 and Qc2. This looks just like a loss of a tempo.} Bxb2 {Gaining a pawn, even if at the cost of my dark-squared bishop. If White wants to regain the pawn, will run into the worse endgame I saw analyzing this position.} 20. Bxb2 {Wouldn't have made such a big difference 20. Rb1 Reb4.} Rxb2 21. Bxa6 Bxa6 22. Rxa6 Ree2 {This is a much better endgame for Black, because he has two active rooks on the 7th rank. White will be forced to place a rook on g1, where it won't affect the game for a long time.} 23. Rg1 Qf6 24. Ra8+ Kg7 25. Ra4 Qc3 {Accepting the exchange of Queens, because I evaluated that the endgame with passive King and Rook was almost lost for White.} 26. Qd4+ Qxd4 27. Rxd4 Kf6 {In the endgame, activate your King as fast as possible!  In this case, it is particularly good, because Red2 or Rbd2 would have led to a draw after Rxd2 Rxd2 Re1 Rxd5 g3 and the endgame 4v3 is a draw.} 28. Rdd1 Kf5 {Continuing to activate my King, because Rd2 draws similarly to last move variations.} 29. Rde1 {A desperate move in a desperate position, Rf1 wouldn't have helped because of Rf2 and the gain of the f4 pawn anyway.} Kxf4 {In order to snatch the pawn, Black has to see Rxe2 Rxe2 Rf1 Ke5 Rxf7?? Re1+.} 30. Rxe2 Rxe2 31. g3+ Kg4 {Going for the h2 pawn.} 32. Rg2 {The pawn endgame is lost, but playing something else wouldn't have saved the game either.} Rxg2 33. Kxg2 Kf5 {}
