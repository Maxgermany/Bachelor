1. e3 d5 2. d4 c5 {A sort of queens gambit in reverse} 3. Bb5+ Nc6 4. dxc5 e6 {e6 rather than e5 in case the opposing player gets a bit materialistic...} 5. b4 {Now we see white, playing materialisticly, attempting to save the pawn on c5. This move, however, leaves the rook open to attacks along the a1-h8 diagonal. A queen on f6 would be a strong move here. This is why e6 was played last move.} a5 {Trying to provoke either c3 or a3} 6. Na3 {Na3?...this move hangs the pawn on b4...} axb4 7. Nb1 {The Knight has no other move than to retreat to its starting square} Bxc5 {Bxc5...white is up a pawn} 8. Nf3 Qf6 {Blacks plan the attack the rook} 9. c3 {A poor attempt at blocking. Nc3 saves the rook} bxc3 10. a4 Nge7 11. Qd3 Bb4 {Lining up a discovery on the king} 12. O-O {White castles out} c2 {Black now forks the rook and Knight} 13. Qxc2 Qxa1 14. Rd1 O-O 15. Bb2 Qa2 16. Bd4 {Bd4?? White hangs the queen...} Qxc2 {Qxc2 now attacks the rook} 17. Re1 {Re1?? Hangs the rook!!} Bxe1 18. Nxe1 {White's Knight on b1 is now lost} Qxb1 19. Bc3 Qc1 {Attacking the bishop on c3} 20. g4 {g4?? Hangs the bishop} Qxc3 21. Kf1 Ra5 {Black wants to get the remaining bishop off of its current diagonal to activate its own white squared bishop} 22. Bxc6 {Bxc6?? Since when do you trade off pieces when you are down so much material. Seems that white is now trying for a draw} bxc6 23. h3 Ba6+ {Forces the king away from the defence of the Knight} 24. Kg2 Qxe1 {White's last piece falls...} 25. Kg3 Rxa4 26. e4 Be2 27. Kf4 Rxe4+ 28. Kg3 Qg1+ {Only a matter of time} 29. Kh4 Rxg4+ {Can't really call this a sacrifice as hxg4 is met with an immediate mate by the queen} 30. Kh5 Rg6+ {mate in 1...} 31. Kh4 Nf5# {}
