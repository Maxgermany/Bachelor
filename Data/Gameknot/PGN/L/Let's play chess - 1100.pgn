[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 {(Back one for intro) This is my favorite opening move and I see no reason to deviate from it now.} e5 {Natural reply. I have seen it so many times, and I have experimented with countermeasures and I have chosen this one...} 2. Nf3 {...attempting the Ruy Lopez, by far the most common of my openings.} Nc6 {And I am obliged! Now it's time for the pin...} 3. Bc4 {...but no! A deviation from my norm! This will now either be an exciting battle or a quick death.} d6 {Of course. He wants his white-squared bishop to be free. Who doesn't?} 4. d4 {The e pawn was waiting on his d brother, and now they will fight side by side...} exd4 {...not for long, I guess.} 5. Nxd4 {If black captures the knight, I have a devious plan.} Nxd4 {And he does!} 6. Qxd4 {d4 is my queen's favorite square, even if she doesn't remain there for long...} c5 {Pawns cannot touch my Queen! How dare he!?} 7. Qe3 {Cowering in fear of the "threatening" pawn :D} Nf6 {Puzzling...it adds little to his attack, and gives me time to do...} 8. Nc3 {...THIS! I am now ready to exploit the hole on d5.} a6 {Wasting time} 9. f4 {!? Why did I not take d5 right now? I probably should have, but this will work fine.} b5 {I guess my bishop will have to retreat...} 10. e5 {...NO SIR! I always favor removing both of the opposing knights from the board over both bishops, and HERE is my opportunity. Here we go...} dxe5 {Should've taken my bishop here} 11. fxe5 {Now he has no protection from my queen...except for my pawn, who will hopefully be moving soon...} Ng4 {Something I did not predict. I fully expected a bishop capture followed by my capture of his knight. He opts to be aggressive against my QUEEN! No one touches her!} 12. Qf3 {Doesn't really threaten the knight, but it DOES threaten something else...} Ra7 {This paved the way for the most controversial move that I played in this game...} 13. Qc6+ {WHAM! Right thru that hole! Even if she isn't there for long, her presence will be remembered...} Bd7 {? Queen exchange would've benefited him more than myself, but he doesn't want to...} 14. Qe4 {My dainty queen is getting tired of this insolence!} f5 {YES! OH JOY! OH RAPTURE! Next move I get to say it!} 15. exf6 e.p.+ {Pawn takes pawn en passant discovered check! YES!} Be7 {Here comes another controversial move...} 16. Qxe7+ {WHAM! Queen straight into the jaws of Hell.} Qxe7+ 17. fxe7 {Poor pawn...so close, yet so far...} Kxe7 18. Bg5+ {Now that I have established a material advantage, it's time to exploit the lack of center pawns with this check. Not flashy, but workable.} Ke8 {? Back to the home square? The monarch is far too passive!} 19. Be2 {That knight was bothering me, so my loyal bishop said GET OUT!} Ne5 {Now that nothing can capture anything, it's time to secure my king. But...which side?} 20. O-O-O {I didn't know which was stronger, so I chose this side.} b4 {Pitiful knight threat.} 21. Nd5 {Long ago I said that I wanted my knight on the d5 square...and now, here he is!} Bc6 {Another knight threat. However, TWO can play at that game...} 22. Bf4 {...Now his big decision must be made. Exchange or no?} Ng6 {??? Completely incorrect, for it allows THIS...} 23. Nc7+ {...WHAM! Check with a protected knight. I love it.} Kf7 {Basically forced.} 24. Bc4+ {BAM! More bishop action! Move, lazy monarch, move!} Kf6 25. Rd6+ {Forking the king and that pesky bishop} Kf5 26. Ne6 {Protecting my bishop} Nxf4 {Exchanges incoming} 27. Rf1 {NOT! Now the knight has pinned himself! Bxg7 does not prevent a knight capture.} Ke5 {? Walking right into the mouth of the waterfall? Why?} 28. Rxc6 {Mmm...beefy!} Nxg2 {This was expected. However, I had little hope for the kingside pawns anyway.} 29. Rxa6 {I want the QUEENSIDE pawns. I have a distinct advantage over here, even though the a, b, and c pawns have not yet moved! :D} Re7 {Now the knight is hungry...better give him a snack...} 30. Nxc5 {YUM!} Ne3 {Supposedly forking the rook and the bishop. However, the counterattack proved devastating.} 31. Re1 {Now the knight is pinned! Black is now freefalling.} Kf4 {The king pin is over, but the knight still protects the ROOK on e7.} 32. Nd3+ {I want to force the king towards the g and h files so my queenside pawns can promote.} Kg5 {Thank you!} 33. Ra5+ {Testing to see if he will go to the h file} Kh4 {and he does!} 34. Re5 {The killing blow. He can forget about winning now.} Rhe8 {Irrelevant. He will be assimilated.} 35. Rxe7 {Resistance is futile.} Rxe7 36. a4 {NOW I am going to promote that pawn, and the knight is STILL pinned!} Re4 {A very weak threat} 37. b3 Kh3 {This shouldn't be hard to figure out now. I'll give closing thoughts at the end. Just watch.} 38. Nf2+ Kxh2 39. Nxe4 Nxc4 40. bxc4 h5 41. c5 h4 42. Ng5 h3 43. Nxh3 Kxh3 44. Rg1 {After this, black resigned. Black's only true mistake in this game was to underestimate the power that my queen had in the opening and the middle game. After I gained the material, black was toast. Thank you for watching one of my few wins. Feel free to send any comments as to what I might've done better. Thank you! :D -Russell}
