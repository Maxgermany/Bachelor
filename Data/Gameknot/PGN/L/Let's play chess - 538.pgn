1. e4 {King's Gambit} e5 2. f4 Nc6 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nc3 Bg4 5. Bb5 Nf6 6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 Be7 8. d3 O-O 9. Be3 {Be3: The good thing is this move develops piece, clears the back for a possible queenside castle, and reinforces the center.  However, Bxc6 is the better move.  (Engine favors white with this move).} exf4 10. Bxf4 Nd4 11. Qd1 a6 {This move is okay.  Perhaps c6 would be a good alternative.} 12. Ba4 b5 13. Bb3 c5 14. O-O c4 {This is a small inaccuracy in calculation. Engine shows why: â€¦ c4 15. dxc4 Nxb3 16. cxb3 Qb6+ 17. Rf2 Rac8 18. Nd5 Nxd5 19. Qxd5 Rc7 20. cxb5 axb5 21. Bg5 Kh8 22. Bxe7 Rxe7. This gives white the extra pawn.  Even Kh8 is an improvement. } 15. dxc4 Nxb3 16. axb3 {Nothing wrong with this move, although something like cxb3 might be a better move. } Qb6+ 17. Kh1 bxc4 18. bxc4 Qxb2 19. Na4 {By going Na4 I protect the piece and also attack his queen (hoping for some momentum). The knight in such a location doesnt look too nice though.  A move like Qd3 is slightly better because it develops my Queen, defends the center, protects all the pieces, and the rooks are now free in the back.} Qb7 20. Bxd6 {This was an error on my part.  I was hoping to get the pawn advantage. Unfortunately 20. ...Nxe4 21. Bxe7 Qxe7 gives the opponent a slight lead.  Should have done Nc3 to bring it back to action. } Nxe4 21. Bxe7 Qxe7 22. Nb2 {Big mistake my me.  Kg3+ being the danger which the opponent does in game.} Ng3+ 23. Kg1 Nxf1 24. Qxf1 Rfd8 25. Nd3 a5 26. Qf5 f6 {This is a mistake by the opponent.  The pawn on a5 is free to take. a4! would be a nice move.} 27. Rxa5 Rxa5 28. Qxa5 Rb8 29. Qa2 g5 30. c5+ Kg7 31. Qc4 Qe3+ 32. Kh2 Rb1 {The purpose of this move is to start create a mating net. This move is too premature and white can still advance pawn to c6.  However, h5! is a much better move limiting the options for whites king to escape.  } 33. c6 h5 34. c7 {Here I was too much in a hurry.  I was planning to promote while neglecting the defence of my King. Engine says this is a blunder which gives black a checkmate in 7: 34. c7 h4 35. Qg8+ Kxg8 36. c8=Q+ Kg7 37. Qb7+ Rxb7 38. Nc1 Qxc1 39. c4 Rb1 40. g3 Rb2#  34. Qc5 would still make this a game worth playing.} h4 {Opponent realizes the checkmate so I resign.}
