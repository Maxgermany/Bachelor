[Opening "King's pawn game (C20)"]

1. e4 {.I was a simple game that I didn't conducted properly in the opening and black managed to equalize, but then he blundered a pawn, and it was just a matter of technique to improve the position to a point were black started to blunder pawn after pawn... } e5 2. Bb5 {Portuguese opening} Nf6 {immediately counter-attack} 3. d3 a6 4. Bc4 {Ba4 is more in the spirit of the opening pining d7 and inviting the over-extension of black's pawns in the queen's wing, but I preferred to shift my "attention" to f7} Qe7 {(N) although not the best move in my opinion as it blocks his bishop in} 5. Nc3 d6 6. f4 {a Portuguese opening theme is to transpose to a king's gambit with some new tactical ideas behind it, hopping to get black off guard...} Nc6 7. Nf3 {now the knight doesn't hamper the f pawn advance, and I can castle king side to get my rook on the f column} Bd7 8. O-O O-O-O {different wings castled king's and we will both be attacking on the king's wing, theoretically my king is more exposed to danger, so I have to grab the initiative and outplay my opponent} 9. Qd2 exf4 10. Qxf4 Ne5 {? to attack my bishop in c4, but allows me to try some tactics} 11. Nd5 {the idea behind black's Ne5 must be to importunate my bishop, but his queen is exposed to a zwischenzug move that allows me to get a pawn or to disturb black's pawn structure} Nxd5 {if Qe8 or Qe6 then Nxf6 would disrupt black's pawn structure, and I could get my bishop to safety with Bb3} 12. Bxd5 {now aimed against f7, a possible sequence is 13.Nxe5 dxe5 14.Qxf7 exchanging queens and gaining a pawn in the process } Be6 13. Bxe6+ {I'll get my pawn anyway} fxe6 14. Nxe5 dxe5 15. Qxe5 {I'll will win a pawn, but black can exchange queens if he wants to with Qc5+} Qd6 {black didn't force the exchange of queens but I'll exchange them and try to convert the advantage with queens off the board} 16. Qxd6 {queens of the board, although Bf4 might have been better} Bxd6 17. Bf4 {offering the exchange to avoid Be5 aimed against b2 and the rook a1} Bc5+ {well played by black, now I'll need to play g2 to get the king back to support the rook on f1} 18. Kh1 {forced} h6 {? pointless, and passive move allows white to consolidate his b2 weakness and attack both g7 and rook h8} 19. Be5 {consolidation of the long diagonal} Rh7 {? pointless again black went from a almost equal position to a lost one in just two passive moves} 20. Rf7 {I can double rooks on the open column, and try to grab one more pawn, black has to play precise moves in order to make it harder for me} Rd7 21. Raf1 {now if black plays Rxf7 I'll play Rxf7 also to keep a rook on the 7th rank} g5 22. Rf7f6 {aimed at e6 black only has Re7 to defend it, so after it I'll play g3 to bring my king back to the centre and in to the fight} Rh8 {?} 23. Rxe6 {discovered attack on the h8 rook, black only has Rh7 to defend the h pawn} Rg8 {??} 24. Rxh6 {... and next I can play Rh8, unless black plays Rdd8, to simplify the game} Rdd8 25. g4 {blocks the g pawn and opens space for my king, the idea is to play Bf6 when possible, first I'll need consolidate and prevent Be3 by playing Rf3 and Kg2 to defend the rook from a possible pin by black with Rf8} Rgf8 {? and now I can force the exchange of both rooks or even all pieces to convert in to a easily won pawn endgame} 26. Rxf8 {two choices for black: Rxf8 Rh8 forces the exchange of the second rook or Bxf8 Rh8 pins the bishop and Bf6 will get the exchange of the remaining pieces} Rxf8 27. Rh8 Rxh8 28. Bxh8 {as planed} Kd7 29. Kg2 {now both kings will approach the centre and I'll start my pawn storm and the game has ended...} Ke6 30. d4 {with tempo} Be7 31. d5+ {with tempo} Kf7 32. e5 Kg8 33. Bf6 {killing black's last chances of counterplay...} Bxf6 {forced, and now I simplified to a won pawn endgame} 34. exf6 {I've chosen to disconnect the pawns to offer the exchange of bishops because now black can't have any chance to draw} Kf7 35. h4 {leaves black a choice between : a) gxh4 and after g5 he can't capture the f (protected) or the g pawn because then the f pawn will promote b) Kxf6 and after h5 he can't move his king away past from the e column or the 5th rank or my h pawn will promote, then the pawn majority in the other wing will advance to force a promotion} gxh4 36. g5 b5 37. b4 {blocks black's pawns and retains 2 extra tempi (a3 and c3) if needed to help the king in the opposition play, on the other wing} Kg6 38. Kh3 {and now black loses another pawn or allows promotion, some possible sequences: a) Kxg5 f7 and promotes b) Kf7 Kxh4 Kg6 Kg4 opposition Kf7 Kf5 opposition Kf8 Ke6 Ke8 opposition a3 loses a tempo Kf8 f7 Kg7 or loses his remaining pawns one by one Ke7 opposition and promotes }
