[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70), Classical defence deferred"]

1. e4 {A common move. A quick move to control the center and get some tempo.} e5 2. Nf3 {Developing a piece and attacking a pawn.} Nc6 {Developing a piece and defending a pawn.} 3. Bb5 {This starts the Ruy Lopez.} a6 4. Ba4 Bc5 {As far as I've heard, this is the Modern Archangel Defense. It is a lagged Berlin, but it is still sound- for the most part.} 5. O-O Nf6 6. c3 b5 7. Bc2 {He is protecting the pawn on e4. I can just capture the pawn if Bb3.} d5 {My goal for the game was to start an attack first. Sadly my plan collapsed later on in the game.} 8. d4 {My opponent was not expecting d5, so my opponent thought for a long time to make this move. The point was to refute my pawn push by making one of his own and attacking a bishop.} dxe4 {I saw the chance of a risky game from this point and wanted to attack as much as I could.} 9. dxe5 {Also attacking my knight.} Ng4 {I wanted to attack a lot, so I started my onslaught on f2. This also attacks e5, a pawn that I could not capture to start.} 10. Ng5 {I was very frustrated while playing the game because I couldn't get a decent attack! He escapes the knight and threatens to play Nxe4.} Qxd1 {I didn't want queens in the game. I also needed this for my next move.} 11. Bxd1 {If Rxf1, then Nxf7 is winning.} e3 {Now that I think about it, I might have wanted to take the pawn on e5. Still, I did not like the idea of giving my opponent a tempo with Nxe4 with my king in the center and my queen's bishop undeveloped. I decided to continue on f2.} 12. e6 {So annoying! My knight is now unprotected with e3 about to fall and f7 is attacked.} Nxf2 {I played this as a "sacrifice." I offered Bf3 to pin my knight to my rook only for an attack. Also, my threat of e3 is now available because there can be a discovered check now with a pawn a square away from promotion.} 13. exf7+ Kf8 14. Bf3 {Stable. Pins the knight and rook and stops Nxd1. Do I really care about rooks, though?} Ne5 {I bring my other knight into the fray. If my opponent plays Bxa8, then 15. ...e2 16. Re1 and either knight to d3 depending on if you want to be safe or not.} 15. Re1 {Stops the whole plan. I can't get a good discovered check in and the pawn promotion plan is done.} Nxf3+ {I need to trade before my pieces are lost!} 16. Nxf3 Kxf7 {I thought I had a win back there...} 17. Bxe3 Bxe3 18. Rxe3 Ng4 19. Re1 Bb7 20. Nbd2 {Our developments are done at move 20 :) I've heard that most games are done by the 20th move.} Rae8 {Opposing the file.} 21. Ng5+ Kf6 {If Nxh7+, then Kg6, Rxe8, Rxe8, and the knight is trapped.} 22. Nge4+ {Bishops prove better in end-games where there are pawns on both sides of the board. It's either I lose my bishop or I fail to protect from superior knight placement.} Bxe4 23. Nxe4+ Kg6 24. Nc5 {We both had very low time on the clock, and only six more moves until the extra hour. I couldn't think of a good defending move, as mine lost a pawn.} a5 25. Nb3 a4 26. Nd4 c5 27. Nxb5 Reb8 28. c4 {I was hoping he wouldn't notice this because we both had a minute left with no delay.} Rhd8 {I'm not getting the open file, so I go for the other major one!} 29. Rad1 Nf6 30. h3 {Protecting against any mate threats, and waiting to see what I would do.} Rxd1 {I was going for a draw here, so a rook endgame is worth it. I also finally got that extra hour.} 31. Rxd1 Ne4 {I needed my knight in a better position to draw!} 32. Rd3 {He touched the rook and was moving between d5 and d3. He chose d3 to go for the a4 pawn.} Kf5 {An} 33. Ra3 Nd2 {If Rxa4, then Nxc5 and the game is closer to a draw.} 34. Rxa4 Nxc4 35. Rxc4 Rxb5 36. b3 g5 37. Kf2 h6 38. Kf3 h5 39. g3 Ke5 40. Ke3 Kd5 41. Kd3 Rb6 {I went for a better rook placement.} 42. Re4 Ra6 {I thought I had my opponent capped here! But no, Re2 was played.} 43. Re2 Rf6 44. a4 {Progressing a passed pawn.} Rf3+ 45. Re3 Rf2 {Perhaps Rf1 was better?} 46. Kc3 h4 {I wanted to trade or lock the pawns with a chance of Rg3 eventually.} 47. g4 Rf1 48. Rd3+ Kc6 {I wanted to go closer to the passed pawns. I thought my rook could handle the rest.} 49. Kd2 Rh1 {His plan was Ke3.} 50. Rf3 Rb1 {I move back to attack b3!} 51. Kc2 Rh1 {Farther from e3...} 52. Rf6+ Kc7 53. Rf5 Kb6 {Closer to a4.} 54. Rxg5 Rxh3 55. Rh5 Rh2+ 56. Kc3 h3 57. g5 Rh1 58. g6 h2 59. Kc2 {If Ra1, then g7, h1=Q, Rxh1, Rxh1, g8=Q and I am lost.} Rg1 60. Rxh2 Rxg6 61. Rh4 Rg3 {Blocking off c3 or d3.} 62. Kb2 Ka6 63. Rc4 Kb6 64. Rc3 Rg2+ 65. Rc2 Rg3 66. Rd2 Ka5 {At this point, the game was agreed a draw. White will have a very difficult time advancing his pawns.}
