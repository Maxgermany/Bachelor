[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {i love e4, but i hate defending, caro kann, sicillian or matching it} e5 {as I am not gifted in playing the sicillian and am a little rusty at my old caro kann here is the match} 2. Nf3 {typical, king's knight opening. Fried liver in the making?} d6 {how about some phillor defense mechanisms} 3. d3 {interesting, i don't play philly cheese steak openings often so this is as good as new to me} Nf6 {wise idea, developing probably, better to stick with basics then risk an attack and kill the game in 5 moves or so...} 4. Nc3 {he apparently wants some presence in the queenside} Nc6 {i'll do likewise} 5. h4 {pawnstormer} Bg4 {classical bishop pin} 6. Be2 {classical defense} Be7 {why bother taking, my bishop can sit around all day, let's develop and get the king out of the center and into another area out of harm's way. The center is relatively safe here,if anything I should be castling queenside, probably a blunder here?} 7. Nd5 {Plant at the base, good old dusty outpost for this bucking bungling bronco} Nxd5 {too bad there's still minors on the board!} 8. h5 {urk........recapturing is a must here} Bxf3 {ok might as well trade and get further up in point value while killing and lessing the chances of death} 9. Bxf3 {take back naturally} Nf6 {run away they want my shrubbery!} 10. c4 {uhoh, maybe castling queenside isn't such a good idea} Nd4 {ooh, knight out post number 2, let's see if comet the wonder horse will work his magic again!} 11. Qa4+ {worthless move, easily defendable, worse yet no protection on the bishop making so if he doesn't bring her back his castle gets smashed} c6 {block} 12. O-O {NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!11} Nxf3+ {Snap we hit the castle wall, down goes the ostriches, too bad we had to caupult a horse over the wall to do, poor Comet you shall be avenged and brough tback to life!} 13. gxf3 {Destroying the walls.....} Nxh5 {Comet Jr.!} 14. Qb3 {Back BACK ATTACK!!!!!!!!!!!!11} Rb8 {Whoa there Jack, hold your horses partner} 15. f4 {what horses all i own are disobdient peasants} Nxf4 {death to inbocele pawns who run foward recklessly into pitchforks!} 16. d4 {Comet Jr. is alive!} Bh4 {oow.............lovely mating net, I think I might have ot checkmate my pants as we found out on a mad lib the other night. don't ask.} 17. Qf3 {urk................no destroy pieces!???????///} Qg5+ {Baba Yaga just hit the jackpot ,a very rich husband and if this were gorrilla chess a king for the butchering and a queen!} 18. Qg2 {no queen sacrifice here, goes for the easy end to all problems} Qxg2# {Death, the most unexpolainaed thing and yet the most peaceful harmony as to what is gone and past and what may be beyond. The secrets of life, amen, are at ones palms. As one chess player once said, you learn morew from defeat then you do from victory. Amen wise man whom said that. Good game Medave, and this Joe Gator calling in to confirm descent into Nantucket airport, you read me yet flight tower?}
