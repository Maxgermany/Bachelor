1. d4 {One of my best games I think. As usual I start with 1.e4, but in this game I wanted to try some openings like Queen's gambit declined or Cole system } g6 {This answer surprised me } 2. Nf3 Bg7 3. e4 {The fast development and the strong center are the main goals here. } c5 {Sicilian?} 4. Nc3 {The alternatives are 4.c3; 4.Be3 or even 4.Bc4 but 4.Nc3 is the most appropriate answer to controlling the center} cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nc6 6. Be3 e5 {Mistake!} 7. Ndb5 Bf8 8. Nd5 Bb4+ 9. c3 Ba5 {Everythig is over for Black already} 10. Nd6+ Kf8 11. Qf3 f6 12. O-O-O Nce7 {Brutal mistake! } 13. Bh6+ Nxh6 14. Qxf6+ Kg8 {And Black resigns}
