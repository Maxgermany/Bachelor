1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 {4.Nf3 is also playable, but gives black a chance to play the sharp Blumenfeld Gambit, 4...b5!?  I prefer the white side of the Benoni to the white side of the Blumenfeld.  } exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. h3 {Keeping the black LSB away from g4. In the modern Benoni, black usually has trouble developing his LSB due to white's grip on the central light squares. One common plan for black is to exchange it early for white's N after white plays Nf3, via ...Bg4->Bxf3. With the text move, this option is no longer available, and there's hope of black's LSB getting in the way of coordinating his other pieces. } a6 {A thematic move for black, attempting to expand on the Q-side.} 8. a4 {Probably best, aiming to restrain black's Q-side play.} Qe7 {Putting immediate pressure on the center. More common is 8... Bg7.  Either way, black needs to find counterplay before white's center pawns can become dangerous.  } 9. Bd3 Bg7 10. Nf3 Nbd7 11. a5 {?! Taking b6 away from the Nd7, but inaccurate, as that N is ultimately better placed on either e5 or g6 (via f8). I should just continue developing with O-O.} O-O 12. O-O Nh5 {? Probably an attempt to prevent Bf4, and also creating options for the fianchetto bishop. In some continuations, ...f5 is useful, too. But IMO the N is misplaced here, and cedes too much central control. 12... Ne5 is probably best. } 13. Be3 Ne5 14. Nxe5 {I also considered 14.Be2, but decided to eliminate black's most active piece. With this N gone, black's pieces look uncoordinated, while White's are well placed to commence operations in the center, taking advantage of the central pawn majority.  If the black N is allowed to remain on e5, black will play for an eventual ...c4 and ...Nd3, possibly redeploying the other N to c5 along the way, which is a typical plan for black in this opening.   } Qxe5 15. Qd2 Bd7 16. g4 {White can now launch an attack, gaining tempo on both the black N and Q.} Nf6 17. f4 Qe7 18. Rae1 {Things start getting dangerous for black. White prepares the central pawn roller.} Bb5 {?! Solving the LSB problem, but giving up control of e6 which encourages white's reply.  Black's best is probably 18... Ne8, preventing 19.e5. Black's counterplay has to come on the Q-side, so after 18... Ne8 black should play for ...Rc8 and ...c4, or the previously-mentioned ...Rb8 and ...b5. } 19. e5 dxe5 20. Bxb5 axb5 21. fxe5 Nd7 {?! 21... Qxe5 22.Bxc5 Qg3+ 23.Qg2 Qxg2 24.Kxg2 Rfc8 25.b4 is probably black's best try, though I prefer white's position.  } 22. Bg5 Qe8 23. Nxb5 {I also considered 23.Ne4, which wins after 23... Nxe5? 24.Nf6+ Bxf6 25.Bxf6, but after 23... Qxe5!? 24.Nf6+ Bxf6 25.Rxe5 Bxe5 black is still in the game. } Qb8 24. e6 {! the bone in black's throat, and the real point behind Nb5. The B controls e7, and the N will be able to control e8 from either c7 or d6. That makes the pawn on e6 fatal for black.  } Qg3+ 25. Qg2 Qxg2+ 26. Kxg2 fxe6 27. dxe6 Rxf1 28. Rxf1 Nf8 {Or 28... Ne5 29.Nc7. } 29. e7 Ne6 30. Re1 {The passed pawn pays off.  30.Nd6 Nc7 31.Nxb7 also wins.  } Nxg5 31. e8=Q+ Rxe8 32. Rxe8+ Kf7 33. Rb8 Bxb2 34. Rxb7+ {Black resigns, as there is no way to stop the a-pawn.}
