1. e4 e6 {not commonly opening for me, makes me easy to control the center } 2. d4 {i decide to go for d4, great advantage for white taking up center tiles} d5 3. exd5 exd5 {French (C01), exchange, Svenonius variation} 4. Nf3 {I decide to leave the book here} Bd6 {preparation for king side attack.} 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. O-O O-O {here goes the symmetry! symmetry variations sometimes annoy me!} 7. h3 {h3 for possible bishop pin. I am the type of exchanging bishop to horse, so sometimes my instincts prepare for that kind of attacks.} a5 {I don't get why he started attacking my queenside, so I ignore that and place my pieces on better tiles} 8. Re1 {early e-file control} a4 {his unstoppable a pawn haha} 9. b3 {I decide to intercept and propose an exchange} axb3 {yup, he goes for that} 10. cxb3 Bb4 {not bad Idea but making pieces move twice in preparation stage was unsual} 11. Bd2 {time for the bishop to come out} Qd6 {so he wants to exchange in that tile. } 12. Bxb4 {I give him his present. making his queen goes to b4 makes it not useful. I take that chance} Qxb4 13.
