1. e4 e6 2. d4 {It looks like some variation of the English opening.} d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nc6 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {Black Queen is coming out pretty early.} 7. Bg5 Qg6 8. Bd3 f5 9.

Nf3 Rac8 21. Re1 Qf6 22. Be2 Nb7 23. h3 Qg6 24. Nh4 {Now I try to attack the King side, still difficult.} Qf6 25. Nf3 Rfd8 26. Nh2 Qf7 27. Bf3 d5 28. b4 a5 29. a3 a4 30. Qe2 Rde8 31. g3 Nd6 32. Qc2 Ne4 33. Rac1 Ba8 {Black Bishop went into the corner giving me little room to enter the middle.} 34. Qe2 Nxc3 {In the process a pawn got down I got to recover it or I have to attack with the remaining pieces. This stage I'm bit nervous.} 35. Qd3 Ne4 36. Qxb5 Nc3 {I got the pawn back but better going back.} 37. Qd3 Ne4 38. Qd1 Qd7 39. Bh5 Ref8 40. Nf3 Rc3 41. Rxc3 {Now getting a chance, after exchanging the Rooks I would get much room for the Queen.} Nxc3 42. Qd3 Ne4 43. Qa6 Bb7 {Now my Queen is in the slot, see still getting attacked.} 44. Qb6 Ra8 {I have some plans to attack the black King while Queen is in the upper part of the board.} 45. Ne5 Qc8 46. Bf7+ {Finally, I launched the attack.} Kh8 47. Qxe6 Qxe6 48. Bxe6 {Here, got rid of the Queens leaving only to attack the King. Another thing is Bishop is attacking the pawn at f5, he has to defend them. He can use the Rook for the moment.} Nc3 {He has some different plans and Knight moved. Then I have a chance of earning a pawn.} 49. Bxf5 Kg8 {That is a little mistake.King is unprotected. Watch...  The nice part is coming.} 50. Be6+ Kf8 51. Ng6+ Ke8 52. Bxd5+ Kd7 53. Re7+ Kd6 {Having a line of King attacks and loosing the Bishop.} 54. Bxb7 Rg8 55. Bf3 Nb5 56. Bd1 {Now he wants to march down a pawn to the opposite end and create a Queen that will dominate the game.} Nxa3 57. Bxa4 Nc4 58. Rd7+ {But again in trouble, that Knight move giving me to attack King steadily.} Ke6 59. Nf4+ Kf5 60. Rd5+ Ke4 61. Bc2+ Kf3 62. Bd1+ Ke4 63. Kg2 {Now very closed to the end. He did not realized that that would be the end. So, thinking of move the Rook instead of leaving the game.} Rf8 64. Bf3# {That is the end! I feel that It was a nice game I played.}
