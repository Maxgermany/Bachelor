[Opening "Sicilian (B28), O'Kelly variation"]

1. e4 {In this game, Black plays inaccurately in the opening, allowing White to annex a large amount of space and slowly squeeze the position towards a tactical finish.} c5 2. Nf3 a6 {The O'Kelly variation, which has a deservedly poor reputation (specifically it can be lively tricky, but not really solid). Black has played a typical Sicilian move, preventing Nb5 after, for example, d4/...cxd4/Nxd4.  One problem is that White doesn't have to play d4 immediately (or at all!). Then, Black's committal pawn move may prove awkward, while White can transposition at his leisure.} 3. d4 {White is not concerned with a direct refutation of Black's opening, which involves lines my opponent should know. It seems more practical to enter an open Sicilian and try to outplay Black on more familiar terrain.} e6 {A strange transposition. Now White has many plans, including the status quo Nc3, the "anti-Sicilian" c3, and c4 in the Maroczy bind spirit. That fact that many moves have been tired (successfully) here speaks to Black's opening choice. His dark squares are in critical condition (see d6 and b6), and he has yet too develop a piece in 3 moves. No doubt many White players past and present have attempted to refute this indulgence with various systems, but in reality Black's Kan-type system will not fall apart so easily with accurate play from the second player.} 4. Nc3 {Inviting Black to enter the Sicilian Kan via ..cxd4} Qc7 {'?!' - OK, White has had enough of this meandering with the c-pawn. This further indulgence by Black invites White's very strong reply.} 5. d5 {Surely best. Black is cramped and underdeveloped.} d6 6. a4 {'!' This prevents ..b5 and secures c4 for the typical manuever Nf3-d2-c4, which arises in many Benoni structures. In effect, White is preparing to suffocate Black on the queenside while he struggles to develop and bring his king to safety. White is clearly better now.} e5 {'?!' - No doubt this is reassuring, as a future e4-e5 is a very scary option for Black to allow, as White's greater development could prove telling with an opening in the center. But in reality e5 is not coming any time soon from White, while ..e5 is not particularly useful now as Black ought to develop on the kingside via ..Ne7-g6 or ..Be7.} 7. Be2 {Blocking ...Bg4 ideas with development (e.g. 7...Bg4? Nd2 and White will reach c4 and trade off his bad bishop for Black's only good piece, when White is essentially winning).  } Nd7 {Black is still underdeveloped on the kingside, but it doesn't much matter in the closed position, at least for now. ..Nd7 is a fair idea, looking at ..Ndf6 or ..Nb6 in the future.} 8. O-O b6 {'?' - Black has lost the thread of his position. The point of ...Nd7 should have been twofold: 1) hitting the e5 square in view of White's obvious f2-f4 ideas which, after an exchange, leave e5 as a powerful outpost; 2) threatening ...Nb6 to counter White's dream knight that will come to c4 soon. Even ..Ndf6 (after ..f7-f5 ideally) might be possible. The text simply wastes time...there is no point developing the bishop to b7, where it does nothing. Much better is ..Ne7, intending ..Ng6 to halt Whites f2-f4 plan.} 9. Nd2 {A typical idea in these positions, clearing the way for f4 and heading to c4.} Ngf6 {'?' - Suffocating himself. The knight does nothing on this square. Still possible was ..Ne7-g6.} 10. Nc4 g6 {'?' - Too slow. Black is lost.} 11. f4 Bg7 12. fxe5 dxe5 13. d6 {'!?' - This is not as it appears, which is to say a patzer move. White vacates d5 with tempo, planning Nd5. The noose tightens, as Black loses even more space and still has not castled. White is winning. Also possible was the typical Qe1 plan, piling up on the kingside dark squares via Qg3/h4 and Bg5. Note how White can easily switch between queenside, central, and kingside plans with his massive space advantage, while Black's pieces struggle to move along the last two files.} Qb8 14. Nd5 Nxd5 15. Qxd5 {'?' - Dios Mio! White has the shocking Rxf7!!, exploiting Black's un-castled king and winning outright in thematic fashion: e.g.: 15.Rxf7 Kxf7 16.Qxd5  Kf8 17. Bh6!! (clearing the way for the a1 rook) Bxh6 18.Rf1  Bf4 19.Nxe5 Nxe5 20.Qxe5 and mate is simply inevitable. Of course Black can decline at some point and suffer heavy material losses, but you see the point. 15.Qxd5 preserves a clear advantage, but it is bittersweet. Black can castle, and White needs a second plan.} O-O 16. Bg5 {The beginning of White's idea to conquer along the dark squares and leverage his d6 pawn, as ..f6 is impossible now and undesirable for Black in any case. White would do well to provoke a future ..f6 or ..h6.} Bb7 17. Qd3 f6 18. Bg4 {'!' - Black's last move has created serious light-squared weaknesses, which White rushes to exploit.} fxg5 {'?' - A losing continuation. Both ..b5, lashing out on the queenside (where all Black's pieces are) and ..Bc6 (protecting the knight and supporting b5) are preferable. Opening the f-file now is too dangerous.} 19. Bxd7 Rxf1+ 20. Rxf1 Qd8 {'??' - A move that loses quickly, though White fails to exploit it fully.} 21. Be6+ Kh8 22. Rf7 {'?!' - White is still winning, but much better is 22.d7! White's pawn is one square from queening and he clears the way for the knight (again!) to penetrate via Nd6, threatening the devastating Nf7  that wins outright.} Rb8 23. Qf3 {d7 was still possible. Jeez, White is rusty!} Bc6 24. Rxg7 {'!' - Finally, White hits upon a crushing move (in fact this was his idea all along. It is instructive to imagine how his blind adherence to this idea caused him to miss the dynamic chance of d7! with a swift win. Always ask yourself what has changed after Black's last move, and demand an answer, says White hypocritically). In any case, White's move demolishes the last defender of the Black king, when he has calculated that Qf7  followed by Nxe5 leads to mate or heavy material gain.} Kxg7 {This allows a forced mate. Also losing was 25...Kh8 26.Nxe5 Rb7 27. Qxb7! Bxb7 28. Nf7 , when White is up a piece and queening the d-pawn in a few moves.} 25. Qf7+ Kh6 26. Nxe5 Qxd6 27. Ng4+ Kh5 28. Qxh7# {Cute - Nimzowitsch no doubt would approve of such a knight.}
