1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3  Since now we have followed the moves of the other annotated game (metalale (1423) vs. warvetchaosone1 (1461)).} g6 {5. ...g6  The Dragon Variation. One of my favorite Sicilian systems.} 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 {7. f3  Preventing Ng4 and an odd exchange between Knight and Bishop on e3. White wants to eliminate the g7 black Bishop and he needs his dark-square Bishop.} O-O 8. Qd2 {8. Qd2  Creating a battery along the c1-h6 diagonal and also freeing the path towards long castle.} Nc6 9. Bc4 {9. Bc4  Blocking the d5 option.} Bd7 10. O-O-O Rb8 {10. ...Rb8  Probably this is a mistake. Too passive. Black usually fights for the control of the c-file with Rc8 and then Qc7. Rb8 sustains the b-pawn, but I can fight about my plan with tranquillity.} 11. Bh6 {11. Bh6  My plan... exchange dark-square Bishops.} Nxd4 {11. ...Nxd4  Maybe played with the intention of 12. Qxd4 then 12. ...Bxh6  and the darksquare black Bishop is still alive.} 12. Bxg7 {12. Bxg7  Ok, no problem. I've reached my first goal easily.} Kxg7 13. Qxd4 b5 {13. ...b5  What?! Ok, this move was hidden to me since this moment. Maybe my opponent looked at it since he played 10. ...Rb8. Well done. But I was not afraid.} 14. Bb3 Qb6 {14. ...Qb6  Looking for Queens exchange.} 15. Qd2 {15. Qd2  No Queens exchange. Keep my lady on board!} Rfc8 {15. ...Rfc8  Other pressure against my castle. } 16. Nd5 Nxd5 17. Qxd5 {17. Qxd5?!   The change of Knights was forced, I think. My Nd5 was too strong and it was ruining the position of black. But now maybe I should have played 17. Bxd5 cause my Queen will be attack many times... not a good choice.} Be6 18. Qg5 {18. Qg5?!  Another imprecision! Why to wait for 18. Qd2? The threat on e6? My opponent is not blind and with the simple Rc7 it can defend the pawn and prepare the square c8 for the b-Rook.} Bxb3 {18. ...Bxb3  This wouldn't happened if I had played 17. Bxd5. My previous choices are bringing me towards oblivion. } 19. axb3 f6 {19. ...f6  Maybe 19. ...Rc7 would have anticipate the Rook battery.} 20. Qd5 {20. Qd5  Again, 20. Qd2 was more accurate, but now there is no imminent attack against Queen in this central square. The problem is that my c2 pawn will be more weak.} a5 {20. ...a5  Trying to march towards the King.} 21. Qe6 {21. Qe6?  What is this?? Another Queen's move? If you look at my previous 10 moves, you will note that I've moved my lady 6 times!! She's a lady, not Rambo! And again, now her movements are limited to the diagonals. The poor pawn e7 was a goal to avoid!  Remember, don't play like me in this game. Never go for something you will never have.} Rc7 {21. ...Rc7  Finally the Rc7 move is played. And for free!} 22. g4 {22. g4  With this move I tried to frighten the black King, but there are no menaces. It also weakens the f-pawn.} Rbc8 {22. ...Rbc8  The battery... I have to defend my c-pawn!} 23. c3 {23. c3??  What a mistake!! I was thinking about the obvious (and much much better) 23. Rd2. But then I thought that the pawn on c3 could guard the b4 square too... what a stupid thought! The b4 square against the safety of my monarch.  23. Rd2 defends the c2-pawn, leaves the d1 square for the h-Rook and stops the check on e3. } Qf2 {23. ...Qf2  23. ...Qe3  was more forcing.} 24. Rd2 Rc7xc3+ {24. Rxc3 !  The final attack begins...} 25. bxc3 Rxc3+ 26. Kd1 {26. Kd1  26. Kb2 can change nothing...} Qxf3+ 27. Re2 {27. Re2  27. Ke1 Rc1  28. Rd1 Rxd1#} Qxh1+ 28. Kd2 {28. Kd2?  Better was... resign! :)  In this way I taken mate in one, the shortest mate. The game was lost, but 28. Re1 Qf3  29. Re2 (29. Kd2 Qd3#) Qf1  30. Re1 (30. Kd2 Qc1#) Qf3#  } Qc1# {What's the worst error? Someone could tell "Your 23rd move!". Yes, but the key of all was, in my opinion, 13. Qxd4 and the consequents Queen moves.   So, the advice is: "Never overlooked a caught for another one, and don't go for wild attack without any kind of plan! Play solid and safe, think about defense before put your Queen in danger."  See you next time! }
