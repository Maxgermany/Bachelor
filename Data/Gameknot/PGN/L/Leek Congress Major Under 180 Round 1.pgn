1. e4 {Another sparkling little game from Steve Rush. "My best ever win in terms of graded opponents and my best game ever and my best move ever."} e5 {Black copies white's first move.} 2. d4 {One pawn offered - the Centre Game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Game} exd4 {Taken, it usually is.} 3. c3 {Another pawn offered, turning it into a Danish Gambit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Gambit} dxc3 {Black takes again.} 4. Bc4 {White offers another pawn.} cxb2 {Black takes again.} 5. Bxb2 {White takes back. The most common continuation is for black to give both pawns back with d5 6. Bxd5 Nf6 7. Bxf7+ Kxf7 8. Qxd8 Bb4+ 9. Qd2 Bxd2+ 10. Nxd2 and a fairly equal ending, maybe white has a very slight edge. However black seems to try to hold onto the extra two pawns - with fatal results!} Bb4+ {White also won quickly in the game https://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x1303449&mv=10&rnd=0.4251310708559717 Voigt, Martin (2258) vs. Parindra, Amran Mojo Pahit (2032)		2004.05.30 which continued 6.

Rxf7+	Kg8 22.	Rg7+	Kh8 23.	Rg8#} 6. Kf1 {Steve plays an interesting move. Of course, two pawns down it would be silly to encourage exchanges.} Bf8 {I find this move very strange though. I see on the Gameknot opening databases that this position before Bf8 has been met several times, and no less than 12 moves have been tried by black - some very unsuccessfully it must be said. Nf6, f6 and Kf8 are the mot common tries. Bf8 is the 5th most popular 9at the time of writing this of course!)} 7. Nc3 {Surprisingly this natural developing move doesn't seem to have been played by anyone else - Nf3, Bxf7+. Qb3 and e5 have been tried.} d6 {Natural development.} 8. Nf3 {And also by white. } Bg4 {Black pins the knight} 9. h3 {Steve gives himself a couple of exclamation marks for this move, but in fact he is missing better alternatives. 9. Bxf7+ Kxf7 10. Ne5+ is playable - winning back the piece as the knight can't be taken without black losing his queen. Also in this position is a variation of the LÃ©gal Trap - 9. Ne5!! and if 9....Bxd1 10. Bxf7+ Ke7 11. Nd5 mate. if 9....Be6 10. Bxe6 fxe6 11. Qh5+ g6 (forced 11...Ke7 12. Qf7#) 12. Nxg6 and white is on top. Or 9...dxNe5 10. Bxf7+ Ke7 11. Ba3+ and black is busted. 9. Qb3 attacking both b7 and f7 looks good too, and indeed 9. Qd5 with the same double attack.} Bh5 {Steve comments "If takes Qxf3 leads to a massive potentially over whelming attack....well this is what sort of happened anyway!" In fact Fritz first of all gives Bxf3 as the best move and later moves to liking Be6, before switching back to Bxf3 - and in both cases gives advantage to black. However this sort of position is much easier to play as white - white has all his minor pieces developed and attacking prospects, while black has to find careful defensive moves.} 10. Qd5 {Well done Steve, out of the various options, he chooses the best! Compared with the position on move 9, as well as attacking f7(although of course this pawn is protected, but it means he doesn't have to worry about say 10...Bxf3, which is now met by a mate on f7) and b7 he is also attacking Bh5. When looking at this position, Fritz at first gives black a slight advantage, but after looking deeper into it Fritz gives white a slight advantage of plus 0.09, then later plus 0.25 "All forced now" is Steve's comment.} Nf6 {Protecting the Bh5 and attacking the queen.} 11. Qxb7 {One pawn back! Obviously the best move.} Nbd7 {Played so that the queen on d8 protects the rook on a8.} 12. Nb5 {Steve again plays the most accurate move, not allowing his opponent time to consolidate. It also meet his opponent's threat of 12.....Rb8 followed by Rxb2} Rb8 {Steve says "what else?....my opponent said after the game he expected my Queen to move at some point and then Bb2 was en prise to gain counter-play....sadly for him not to be!" Fritz gives 12.....Rc8 as the best move for black with plus 2.22 for white.} 13. Nxc7+ {The obvious continuation. Fritz now suggests black should give up the queen with 13...Qxc7 with +5.94 to white. However giving up the queen is really equivalent to resigning.} Ke7 {So black plays the only other legal move.} 14. Nd4 {Steve "My best move ever." and "a whole Queen sacrificed". Of course if the queen is taken white has a choice of queen mates with Nf5 or Nc6 mate.} Ne5 {"only move to avoid a double knight mate". In fact Fritz is still wanting 14....Qxc7 but that is hopeless for black (+11.75 to white). I guess in the eyes of Fritz anything is better than an immediate mate. OK dear reader, stop and find the quickest mate.} 15. Nf5+ {Fritz likes this move too. https://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=214011} Kd7 {Forced.} 16. Bb5+ Nc6 {Forced again. "Although BxNc6 is mate I decided on a prettier mate."} 17. Qxc6+ {So he played this.} Kc8 {Forced. Now find the quickest mate for white.} 18. Ba6+ {Another check. Nc7 anywhere is a quicker mate.} Rb7 {Another forced move. Again find the quickest mate.} 19. Bxb7+ {Check again.} Kb8 {Forced.} 20. Na6# {I must admit this is a pretty knight mate, and I don't blame Steve for playing this rather than the quicker mates.}
