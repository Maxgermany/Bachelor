1. d4 e6 2. c4 Bb4+ 3. Bd2 Bxd2+ 4. Nxd2 Nf6 5. Ngf3 O-O 6. e4 {I was aiming for the center with my pawns.} d6 7. Qc2 h6 8. Bd3 {Aiming for the h7-spot with my battery of Queen and light-square Bishop.} Nbd7 9. O-O-O {O-O-O. Long castling, my goal was a pawn storm against Blacks castled King, because of that plan it was necessary for me to castle long.} Re8 10. e5 {Pretty good move. Opens up the b1-h7 diagonal and also chasing away a defending piece from the King´s camp.} dxe5 11. dxe5 Ng4 12. Bh7+ {Looks like a meaningless check, but i had a plan with it.} Kf8 13. Ne4 {It seems at a first glance that Black can win a pawn here. But he can´t, will then lose his Queen.} Qe7 {Black is relocating his Queen to a safer spot, away from the open and potentially dangerous d-file.} 14. Qc3 {Now the e5-pawn must be more protected.} h5 15. h3 {Chasing the Knight away.} Nh6 16. Rdg1 {I want to control the g-and h-files with my Rooks after opening up.} g6 17. g4 {Logic move from my perspective.} Kg7 18. Bxg6 {That Bishop became trapped. But if my assault against Black´s King will have progress I can live with it.} fxg6 19. gxh5 Kh8 20. Rxg6 {I got already three pawns for my Bishop and has opened up the g-file against Black`s King. Probably a good exchange.} Qf8 21. Qe3 Nf5 22. Qg5 Re7 23. Rg1 {I´m increasing the pressure against Black´s King camp. No extremely hurry.} Kh7 24. Nf6+ Nxf6 25. exf6 {Black´s position are worsening for every move!} Rf7 26. Ne5 {And Black´s f-Rook is trapped.} Bd7 27. h6 {Better to improve my position than take Black´s Rook.} Rxf6 {??? Not so good of Black?} 28. Rxf6 Qd8 29. Qg6+ {The end is near...} Kh8 30. Nf7# {Checkmate! 1-0.}
