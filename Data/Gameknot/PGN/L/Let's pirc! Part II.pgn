[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 d6 {And here we go. Pirc Alert!} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Bd3 {First unusal move by white. Standard would have been Nc3. So my opponent goes into a more defensive style. } g6 4. h3 {? A more or less useless move at this stage. Seems like someone is panicing? Weekens kingsafty.} Bg7 5. b3 {Still no move to prepare e5 (which will follow right away!). Prepares fianchetto for the blacksquared bishop. Perhaps my opponent was planning on Bb2 to build up pressure on the diagonal.} O-O 6. e5 {A not well prepared and early e5. The move that is often kind of a decision in the game... Leaves the d4 pawn weak (in addition to g2)  } Nd5 {Since I had to go somewhere and due to the lacking Sc3 my knight gets a cosy home at d5. Perhaps xe5 would have been the better decision. Also the Bishop is locking on d4 and a1} 7. a4 {?? what is he planning to do? This gives away a pawn} dxe5 8. dxe5 Bxe5 {After the exchange I'm a pawn up my Bishop is attacking the rook!} 9. Ra3 {Only other option is a2 which would provoke Nc3 (which still would have needed to be prepared)} Qd6 {Letting the Queen join the attack.} 10. Bc4 {Another move with the bishop... just one white minor piece has moved!  (although the blacksquared bishop shows his influence already:))} Qb4+ {Building up preassure. Not sure if it is the best move for black.} 11. Bd2 {Natural. } Nc3 {Seems natural, but:?? Fritz notes: Qf3! This attacks the knight(!) and strenghens the preassure on F7. And the worst thing about it: Me as Black would have no idea what to do about the knight...  12 ... Nc6 does not help.. Ne2 would be the next step... So it really starts to get tricky } 12. Bxc3 {Fortunatly for myself white decided on Bxc3} Bxc3+ 13. Nd2 {? Sacrificing a whole rook. Nxc3 woud at least try to contain the dammage. From here on the game was more or less won, but how is it said: The hardest thing is winning a won game.} Qxa3 14. Ngf3 Rd8 {When ahead in material you always prefer to trad off as long as it does not lead to an extrem lack of development... So I thought on seizing the only open file.} 15. O-O Qb4 {White raises his kingsafty, but the absence weakens the d2 Square, so I had to take aim on it. Now there is no hope left for the poor knight...} 16. Re1 Bxd2 17. Nxd2 Rxd2 18. Qc1 Bf5 {Exchanging pieces is going on in my favor, time to look at new weaknesses: c2 is potentially weak, but it can be secured via Bd3, f2 seems to be a good target too.} 19. Re2 {Allowing me to exchange further. } Rxe2 20. Bxe2 Qc3 {And c2 is finally mine!} 21. Qd1 Nc6 {Qd1 as a threat to my king?} 22. Bc4 Qxc2 23. Qe2 Qxe2 {Grabbing the pawn and exchanging. The game is finished and there is nothing left I have to fear. However my opponent wanted me to enjoy the hunt to the last moment and to collect my trophy. :)} 24. Bxe2 Bc2 25. f4 Bxb3 26. g4 Bxa4 27. g5 Nd4 28. Bc4 Bb3 29. Bxb3 Nxb3 30. Kf2 a5 31. Kg3 a4 32. Kg4 a3 33. h4 a2 34. h5 a1=Q 35. hxg6 Qg1+ 36. Kf3 hxg6 {King of brainless Kinghunt. Getting a queen to finish the job...} 37. Ke4 Qf2 38. Ke5 Qd4# {Finally the killing blow}
