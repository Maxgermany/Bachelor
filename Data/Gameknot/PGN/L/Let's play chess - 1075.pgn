1. e4 {I have just started playing e4 and I am experimenting.  I am playing white here.} g6 {I play the pirc/modern/KID from time to time.  The problem with g6 is that in corr. chess white just has to many options.} 2. d4 Bg7 3. c4 {I wanted to take this into KID lines, c4 gives it more of a d4 type feeling.  I originally played d4 so this is good for me.} d6 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. f3 O-O {Black is letting me develop however I wish, so.... I will take the sameish setup.  I consider this the best threat against the KID.} 6. Bd3 b6 7. Nge2 Bb7 8. Be3 Nc6 9. Qd2 e5 {Since black will not be getting through this center I will play on the kingside and attack.  I leave my kings position in doubt so that black doesn't no where to attack.  At any time I could castle queenside.   When I was in Sacramento for the USCF Junior High Nationals, I spent a lot of my time observing the top board: Alec Getz from Hunter.  I noticed that he played the caro-kann several times and didn't castle.  I learned that he found his rook on h8 to be better placed there then if he castled and it was on f8.  Because ofter he would later play h7-h5-h4.} 10. h4 exd4 11. Nxd4 Nh5 {This is a blunder.  I "failed" to capitalize on it fully.} 12. g4 Bxd4 {Here I should have played: Bxd4 Nxd4 Qf2! when the knights on d4 and h5 are both attacked, winning me a pieces.  I didn't even look this far though!!  I saw that after Bxd4 Nxd4 he was threatening Nxf3  winning the queen and Nc2  forking the king and rook, and stopped looking!!  This is a bad habit of mine that I am breaking it slowly. } 13. gxh5 Bxe3 14. Qxe3 Ne5 15. O-O-O a5 16. hxg6 fxg6 17. Rdf1 {All the pieces are going to the king side.  Black won't even get a counterattack going.} c6 18. f4 Ng4 19. Qg3 Nf6 20. h5 {I still have the iniative.  While black is reacting to my threats I am developing towards his king!} Qe8 21. hxg6 hxg6 {If 21...Qxg6 I was planning on Qh4 when the threats of Qxh2, e5 and Rg1 were good for me.} 22. e5 dxe5 23. fxe5 Nd7 24. Bxg6 {Now I have this completely won.  Black's king has no cover and all my pieces are coming in on him!} Rxf1+ 25. Rxf1 Qxe5 {Now the tactics finish him off.  I might have been able to get in Bh7  Kxh7 Rf7 , but I didn't quite like it.  So I took the less risky route.} 26. Bf7+ Kf8 27. Bh5+ Ke7 28. Rf7+ Kd6 29. Rxd7+ {Winning the queen.  30...Kd3 31.Bg5  Kf6 32.Rf7  wins the queen.}
