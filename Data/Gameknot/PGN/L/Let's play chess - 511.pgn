1. a3 {awfull start for my opponent, I never understand why so many people start with this move, everytime I see this I feel like  playing as white with black pieces.} e5 {regular developing move} 2. e4 {same for my opponent, so I decided to go to vienna oppening with black pieces} Nc6 {here it is} 3. c3 {kind of interesting move, I couldn't understand what bobtucker wanted to do, so I just continued with my regular plan} f5 {which is pawn sacrifice. like this, kinda safe version of kings gambit with black pieces} 4. Qc2 {declined} fxe4 {decline accepted} 5. Qxe4 {I really was hoping that he will do this because it allows me to develop while attackin the queen} Nf6 {with knight} 6. Qe2 {kinda unexpected move, closing the path of white bishop} Bc5 {beside being regular developing move, black bishop is attacking vulnarable square f2, after castling it will be attacked by two pieces} 7. b4 {not a thread really...} Bb6 {not giving up my goal} 8. a4 {at this point I felt that I'm going to win. really he is not developing. considering that he may move a4-a5 I felt like he will lose one more move} a6 {so I just opened safe square for my bishop} 9. a5 {yeap here it is} Ba7 {now it's safe.} 10. h3 {again one more wasted move.} d5 {opening line for white bishop and preparing e5-e4. besides that I have another option d5-d4...} 11. Bb2 {he must be considering second one and decided to guard it} Ne4 {attacking lovely f2} 12. d4 {closing the shooting space of my black bishop} Qf6 {but I bring my queen here, here a lot of complications possible, so I just wait for my opponents move.} 13. Nf3 {white are defending and has all pieces undeveloped. at this moment I decided to act straightforward} exd4 {so I start with} 14. Nxd4 Nxd4 15. cxd4 Bxd4 16. Bxd4 Qxd4 {so at the end I have centralised queen, very powerfull knight and king ready to castle with open f file.black need to defend the a rook and has a lot of weak undefended squares...not bad uh?} 17. Ra2 {as expected, also defending f2} O-O {defending and attacking:)} 18. f3 {black wasn't expecting this move because of} Ng3 {knight pin...} 19. Qd3 {awfull awfull, though I don't see any good defence possible} Re8+ {bringing my pieces with tempo. rook h1 is still there...} 20. Re2 {my knight now has choise to choose between to tasty rooks:)} Qxb4+ {white has many strong pieces attacking and I don't want to lose my queen} 21. Nd2 {possibly the only move} Nxe2 {choosing between two rooks I decided to take on e2 because the other one doing nothing...later I thought I was wrong} 22. Bxe2 {here I noticed that white now can castle...what a dissapointment///} Qxa5 {defending Qxd5 check} 23. O-O {now they castle} c6 24. Bd1 {??have no idea. at this moment I thought that I need to shift my heavyweight weapon to kingside as soon as possible.} Qc5+ {starting with tempo.} 25. Kh1 {the only legit move } Qd6 {continuing with my plan} 26. Nc4 {huh...this move does nothing but help black} Qg3 {preparing soil for mate trap} 27. Nd2 {saving his knight...white lost two moves while black shifted to the king side completely} Re5 {to help queen} 28. Qd4 {wasted move again} Bxh3 {with a possible 29...Qxg2 checkmate...after this everything finishes very fast} 29. Qg1 Rh5 30. Qf2 Bxg2+ 31. Kg1 Qh2# {I hope you liked it.
