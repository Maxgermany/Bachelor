[Opening "Old Benoni defence (A43)"]

1. d4 c5 {Going for Benoni} 2. dxc5 {Anti-Benoni, aiming for a classical game where no opening preparation is needed} e6 {3.b4 a5 4.c3 axb4 5.cxb4 Qf6} 3. e4 Bxc5 {resembles the pawn structure of an Open Sicilian, but where Black has a piece developed, instead of White.} 4. Nf3 {This knight would normally be on d4, and Black's dark-squared bishop undeveloped. (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4)} Nc6 5. Bd3 {controlling the light squares} Nge7 {aiming for Ng6, downgrading the quality of White's light-squared bishop} 6. O-O O-O 7. c3 {controlling dark squares and giving the light-squared bishop more scope} Ng6 {controlling dark squares and blocking the b1-h7 diagonal} 8. b4 {gaining tempo, but potentially weakening} Bb6 9. a4 {there is no threat, since my bishop has escape on c7} d5 {Since White has lost a lot of time in development, I figured it was a good idea to open up the position, even at the cost of accepting an isolated d-pawn.} 10. exd5 exd5 11. Bxg6 {This move gives me the bishop pair} fxg6 {Even though it is unprincipled to capture away from the center, I figured it was more important to boost my lead in development by activating my rook along the f-file, pressuring the knight on f3.} 12. Ba3 {Aiming to pressure my rook on f8} Bg4 {threatening to give White doubled pawns, weakening the kingside} 13. b5 {Instead of the more passive Ne7, I decide to double White's kingside pawns without giving up the bishop pair} Ne5 {even at the cost of sacrificing the exchange} 14. Bxf8 {White will be playing with no bishops against my 2 bishops} Nxf3+ {creating doubled f-pawns} 15. gxf3 {It might seem like I am losing a full rook} Bh3 {but I have Qg5+ and Qg2#} 16. Be7 {deflecting defender of d5} Qxe7 {now I am only down the exchange} 17. Qxd5+ {guarding g5 with tempo} Kh8 18. f4 {further guarding g5} Qh4 {attacking f4 and g4} 19. Qg5 {but now White trades queens} Qxg5+ 20. fxg5 Rf8 {bringing in another attacker to the kingside} 21. Nd2 {planning Bxf1 Rxf1 to keep the f2-pawn defended, } Rf4 {going for Rg4+ Kh1 Bg2+ Kg1  Bf3#} 22. Kh1 Bxf2 {Now the pawn count is even. If I win another pawn, then the combination of my extra pawn and bishop pair activity will be more than enough to compensate for being down The Exchange.} 23. Rae1 {threatening mate by exploiting the pin} h6 {Luft} 24. gxh6 gxh6 25. Re8+ {harassing king} Kg7 26. Re7+ Kf8 27. Rxb7 {allowing me to take back the exchange and convert to a simple bishop vs. knight advantage} Bxf1 28. Nxf1 Rxa4 {Now material is even, but the bishop is stronger than the knight in a rook endgame, and in an endgame with pawns on both sides of the board. Those are two reasons why the bishop is much better than the knight in this position.} 29. Kg2 Bb6 {bishop can influence kingside as well as queenside} 30. Rd7 Rc4 {harassing backward pawn} 31. Rd6 {attacking g6} Kf7 32. Rd7+ Ke6 33. Rd3 {defending backward pawn} Rc5 {attacking b5-pawn, which has no potential defenders} 34. Rg3 Kf6 35. Rf3+ Kg7 {evading threats against g6} 36. c4 {the weaknesses created by White's earlier pawn advances might be more of an issue than the bishop vs. knight imbalance} Rxc4 37. Ng3 Rb4 {winning second pawn} 38. Rd3 Rxb5 {now I have a passed a-pawn.} 39. Rd7+ {White's only drawing chances are winning both my a-pawn and g-pawn for the knight, aiming for the infamous drawn endgame of king and wrong-colored bishop plus h-pawn vs king} Kf6 40. Ne4+ Ke6 41. Rg7 Rb2+ 42. Kg3 {White resigned}
