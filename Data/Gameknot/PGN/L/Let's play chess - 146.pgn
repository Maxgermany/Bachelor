1. e4 c6 2. Nc3 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 Nc6 {This is an unorthodox Caro-Kann.} 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. h3 h6 7. Bb5 a6 8. Ba4 b5 9. Bb3 e6 10. O-O Bd6 {Bd6 prevents Bf4, which is the Bishop's best square.} 11. Ne2 O-O 12. c3 Bb7 {Black has caught up in development due to White making a couple of tempo-wasting moves.} 13. Nh2 Bxh2+ {I felt like I needed to prevent Ng4 and preserve my Nf6 for defensive purposes.} 14. Kxh2 Re8 15. Bc2 e5 16. dxe5 Nxe5 17. Nd4 {Nd4 is a good square for this Knight.  It would be good to trade it off.} Ne4 18. f4 Nc4 19. b3 Ncd6 20. f5 {In haste to attack, I think White missed the hanging pawn.  I calculated and estimated that I would have time to capture it.} Nxc3 21. Qg4 Qf6 22. a3 Nde4 {Ne4 cuts off protection for the Nd4.} 23. Nf3 Ne2 24. Bf4 {This is a good square for the Bishop, but it allows the trade.} Nxf4 25. Qxf4 Rac8 26. Ne1 {I think this was an oversight.  White needed to deal with the threat to Bc2, but I think Rac1 was an improvement.  This move cuts off protection to the Ra1.} Qxa1 27. Kg1 Qxa3 28. Bxe4 {I think it might have been better to keep the Bishop on the board when down material.} Rxe4 {I'm not sure this was best.  dxe4 takes valuable squares away from the Ne1.} 29. Qg3 f6 30. Nd3 Qxb3 31. Rf3 Qc3 32. Qg6 Qc7 {g7 is vulnerable.} 33. Nf2 {This loses instantly.  The Qc7 already cuts off the escape squares for White's King.} Re1# {}
