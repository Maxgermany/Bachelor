1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f5 3. Bc4 fxe4 4. Nxe5 Qg5 5. d4 Qxg2 6. Qh5+ g6 {Ok. The battle field is set.  Black has accepted the 'poisoned' g2 pawn, and white has begun to try attempt proof of his opening beginning with 6. Qh5 . After looking it up on the web I found a quote I liked. Apparently one Graham Burgess (of whom I know nothing) has said "Is not utterly, clearly bad.".} 7. Bf7+ {This is mandatory. Any other move (as far as I can see) destroys whites game.} Kd8 8. Bxg6 {?! This is most common in the torney (this far). It's a fun move that makes all kinds of tactics availible. There is however another possibility that leads the game into more normal/stable lines, 8. Qg5 ?!. A possible continuation is 8. ... Qxg5 9. Bxg5  Be7 10. Bxe7  Nxe7 11. Bb3 and white should be better. Lead in development and control of the center.  The black king is stuck in the center and white still has the ability to castle. I think I'll try it in a few games.} Qxh1+ 9. Ke2 {Ke2 is better than Kd2. After Kd2, Bh6  is troublesome.} Qxc1 {So. The bishop has fallen. Time to regain the rook.} 10. Nf7+ {Forking king and rook. } Ke8 {Ke7 is mate in one. Qe5#.} 11. Nxh8+ {White regains the rook with discovered check.} Kd8 {Ke7 is still a blunder but better would have been hxg6. Q&K can do less damage than Q&K&B.} 12. Nf7+ {Get out of the corner with check. Since Ke7 still is a bad move white can take a draw here by perpetual check. (12. ... Ke8 13. Nd6  Kd8 back and forth)} Ke8 13. Qxh7 {Ok. This is a faith move. I have no idea if there is a forceful refutation to this, but I felt (and feel) that blacks king is in serious trouble.} Qxc2+ {?! I really don't know what this move accomplishes. Granted, the g5 square is no longer an issue, and the Q was doing nothing on c1. But after Nd2, she is almost as usless.} 14. Nd2 Nf6 {I expected this move. And had prepared for it.} 15. Ne5+ {This discovery forces the king back to d8 and vacates a good escape square for my queen.} Kd8 16. Qf7 {Now I'm attacking both the knight and the bishop. Both captures would come with check. When I played with this in the analysis window looking at responses to Nf6. I realised that the most natural looking defence is a horrible blunder... } Be7 {... might look ok at first glance. Actually black had to accept the loss of both pieces and move his c-pawn. But in the back of my head I hoped for this.} 17. Qe8+ {Sacking the queen for mate next move.} Nxe8 18. Nf7# {My first smothered mate here at GK. I love smothering the king. I always look for ways to do it but I so seldom get the chance.}
