1. d4 {Initiates a game that is more positional in nature. } d5 {I always played the Gruenfeld against d4 but because of recent setbacks on the opening I returned to the more classical approach d5.} 2. c4 {Initiates the Queens Gambit, offering a non-center pawn for blacks center pawn.} e6 {Accepting the gambit offers lively game and requires more energetic play. I decline thinking of keeping my position close trying to understand what my opponent is planning.} 3. Nc3 {the most common and the most logical move in this type of position.} Nf6 {Here instead of 3...Nf6 I wanted to play the super refinement move 3...Be7 waiting for white to move his bishop out or shut it in with 4.e3} 4. Nf3 Be7 {now I'm done developing my kingside and ready to castle} 5. e3 { } O-O 6. Be2 b6 {the queens bishop is always a problem piece to develop in the QGD.} 7.

Bg4 {a last trick to win the game by a back rank mate if I'll take his queen first. So why win the queen when I can win the game via endgame by simplification!} Rxf2 26. Bxe6+ Rf7 27. Bxf7+ Kxf7 28.
