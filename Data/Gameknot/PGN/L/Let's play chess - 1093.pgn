1. e4 {After beeing absent for a couple of months, I decided to start playing at gameknot again. Since my opponent had a low rating, I opened with e4-e5, although the scandinavian (e4-d5) is my favourite opening. I played quickly in the beginning, and due to that had nothing from the opening.  The crucial point of the game was at move 22. when white should have taken on c6 with his queen. But... see for yourself what happened.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 b5 6. Bb3 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Nc3 d6 9. Nd5 Nxd5 10. Bxd5 Bd7 11. b3 Rb8 12. c4 Nd4 13. Nxd4 exd4 14. cxb5 axb5 15. b4 c6 16. Bb3 Be6 17. Bd2 Qb6 18. a4 bxa4 19. Rxa4 Rba8 20. Qc2 Rxa4 21. Bxa4 Ra8 {Honestly, i dont know if I'd have any compensation if white played Qc6 here. My bishop at e7 would remain paralized.} 22. Bxc6 Ra2 {Immediately punishing white by winning two pieces for a rook pawn.} 23. Qc1 Rxd2 24. Qxd2 Qxc6 25. f4 {The only way to win is to block the massive pawn center, white built up. Can you find the best move? } f5 {f5! White is forced to Re1 since black threatens to take 2x on e4.  After 25.exf5 Bxf5 white has no counterplay at all and is forced to inactivity. Black on the other hand, would have all the time in the world to try to improve his position. } 26. Re1 Bh4 {Another fine move. The purpose is to bring the bishop to f6, and meanwhile cause another weakness in the white-kings camp. The alternate 27.Re2, is even worse since 27...fxe4, 28.dxe4 (Rxe4, Bf5..leading to a similar position discussed on the previous move) Bg4 captures the rook. } 27. g3 Bf6 {The bishop controls the important e5 square. } 28. Qe2 {I see no active (better) moves here. } d5 {d5! The centre is locked. } 29. exd5 {Maybe e5 would have given better chances to survive. Now the rest is easy.} Bxd5 30. h3 {Certanly not a good move, but what else? } Bf3 31. Qa2+ Bd5 32. Qa7 h6 {Black doesnt have to hurry. 32..h6 was necessarry in view of Qb8 , and suddenly it is white who wins. } 33. Qc5 {White cannot allow Qc2.} Qxc5 {So much about my first game. I didnt know i'd have to go over such a long distance to beat a 1400 player, but at this moment i knew that the most of the job was done. The rest is technique. I'm especially glad about my play between move 22 and 28.} 34. bxc5 Kf7 35. Rc1 Bc6 36. g4 Ke6 37. Kf2 fxg4 38. hxg4 Kd5 39. Kg3 Be7 40. Rc4 Bxc5 41. g5 hxg5 42. fxg5 Bb5 43. Rc1 Bxd3 44. Kf4 g6 45. Rd1 Be2 46. Rd2 d3 47. Rb2 Bd4 48. Ra2 Bc3 49. Ra3 d2 {}
