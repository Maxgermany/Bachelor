1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {I'm always happy when Black locks in their c pawn, but I have to confess that I've lost several of those games.  It's not a clearcut disadvantage obviously.} 3. e3 a6 {I think this is a waste of a tempo.  } 4. b3 Bg4 5. Bb2 Qd6 6. Be2 {This unpins the N.} h5 {Black decides to play very aggressively and go for a direct Kingside attack.} 7. h3 Bf5 8. a3 {After Bf5, White's c pawn is always vulnerable to Nb4.  a3 is played to prevent Nb4.} Nf6 9. Nbd2 e6 10. Ne5 Nd7 {Nd7 removes protection from h5, so that pawn is now hanging.} 11. Nxd7 Qxd7 12. Bxh5 {White wins a pawn.} O-O-O 13. Bg4 {I think the Kingside attack idea can be blunted if I can exchange the developed attacking pieces.} Bd6 14. Bxf5 exf5 15. Qf3 g5 {Black continues with the Kingside attack, apparently unconcerned about the hanging pawn on d5.  This is a fatal pawn to take if the Bd6 could make a check--which it often can.  In the position, I haven't castled yet so, for example, Bxh2+ is not possible.  With a castled K, Qxd5 would lose the Q.} 16. Qxd5 f6 17. O-O-O {Now that I've castled Queenside, a direct Kingside attack is not so worrisome.} f4 18. Qf3 Qe7 {Black doubles up on the target at a3.} 19. Nc4 {This protects a3 and allows me to remove one of the attackers.} Rh7 20. Nxd6+ Qxd6 {Now White is two pawns up and should be able to win in the endgame by exchanging appropriately.} 21. Qg4+ Kb8 22. Qf5 Rdh8 23. d5 {d5 might not be best here, but it does improve the Bb2.} Ne5 24. exf4 gxf4 25. Kb1 {With the K on c1, White cannot play Qxf4 due to Nd3+, winning the Q.} Rh7h5 {This surprised me.  I was expecting Rh4 to protect the f4 pawn.} 26. Qxf4 {Now White has an easy potential passed pawn on the Kingside with a 3-1 majority.} Rh5h4 27. Qg3 Rh4h5 28. Qe3 Rg5 {This move loses quickly because of the pawn fork.} 29. f4 Ng4 30. hxg4 Rgg8 {Now Black has a really significant material disadvantage.  Time to exchange down to eliminate resistance and push the material advantage.} 31. Rxh8 Rxh8 32. g5 {Black cannot play fxg5 due to Bxh8.} Rh2 33. gxf6 Rxg2 34. f7 {Black resigned here as there is no way to stop the pawn now.  White can play Qe8 and force the pawn promotion.}
