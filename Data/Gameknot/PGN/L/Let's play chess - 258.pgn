1. e4 {Any comments are welcome, especially from all the higher rated players!  This is my game against a much higher rated opponent, so I decided to try the annotation feature and to learn more from my loss. :)} c6 {black starts with Caroâ€“Kann defense, which at my level is a very rare choice.} 2. d4 {I was considering also c4 instead of d4, but then I would end up with an isolated d pawn, which could be a problem.} d5 {main line.} 3. Nd2 {maybe not the best choice to block the bishop, but keeps my c pawn free to move and hopefully knight will not stay there for long} dxe4 {I don't know why, but black takes,} 4. Nxe4 {so I am happy to advance my knight.} Nd7 {black also decided to temporarily block his bishop. Somehow this move is considered to be ok, although for me the black's position looks very passive. White is ready to move both bishops, but black cannot move any of his bishops.} 5. Bc4 {simple development move.} Ngf6 {black offers to exchange knights, } 6. Qe2 {I have to protect my knight, because I don't want to take on Nxf6 giving up my only developed knight and helping black to get the other knight from d7 to f6. Moving Queen also prepares connecting rooks and possible castling long.  Now I checked some chessok database and it says that 6. Nxf6 has been played a lot, even by some super GMs rated 2740, but my 6. Qe2 only by a few, the highest being 2177, so not even master level :(} Nxe4 {black takes knight and gets another knight developed with a tempo.} 7. Qxe4 {ok, maybe it was not a good idea to move the Q, because now it will be chased away.} Nf6 {I guess the only reasonable place for Q is d3.} 8. Qd3 {.} g6 {black prepares for fianchetto, attacking d4 pawn, I will make b2-c3-d4 pawn chain to counter that black bishop.} 9. Nf3 {developing knight, preparing to castle} Bg7 {fianchettoing bishop} 10. Bg5 {development almost finished now} O-O {castling short} 11. O-O-O {I decided to castle long just to create more dynamic and exciting game. Black's fianchettoed bishop is pointing at this direction, but I was planning to move Q to d2/e3 and then Bh6. My plan didn't work out :)} b5 {attacking with a tempo} 12. Bb3 {only square} Bf5 {developing with a tempo.} 13. Qd2 {probably better was Qe2 or Qe3, but i was still hoping for a possible Bh6.} a5 {now it's getting dangerous for my LSB, there are obviously moves a3 or c3, I considered only c3,  but maybe a3 would be better for long term pawn structure, what do you think?} 14. c3 {a3 instead of c3? } Ne4 {.} 15. Qe3 {I think the only move.} a4 {.} 16. Bc2 {.} Nxg5 {.} 17. Qxg5 {I retook with Q, but now I think maybe knight 17. Nxg5 would be more active?} Bxc2 {.} 18. Kxc2 {.} Qd5 {In this position black king is fairly safe, but white king not so much, so white is happy to exchange queens.} 19. Qxd5 {.} cxd5 {Who do you think is better now after all the exchanges?  I think we are fairly equal.  Blacks king is safer, but now after the queens are gone there are no threats to white king either. Black has a bishop, which can give some advantage against a knight in endgame, but with so many pawns maybe it will not be the case. At least at the moment my pawn chain is pointing against the fianchetto, so it looks goods for me.  What do you think?} 20. h4 {just starting to push my pawns, maybe create some threats to black king.} a3 {I didn't expect this move. What should white do now?} 21. b4 {I chose b4:  to isolate a3 pawn and  to protect my c3, d4 pawns, which limit black's bishop} h5 {.} 22. Kb3 {.} Ra7 {.} 23. Rd3 {I want to move my knight to b1, but decided to first overprotect c3 pawn, in view of Bh6, Rac7, Rfd8.} e6 {so now black has (almost) all the pawns on white squares, so the bishop can move freely.} 24. Nd2 {.} Rc8 {.} 25. Re1 {.} Bh6 {.} 26. Nb1 {.} Rca8 {my knight is keeping opponent's two rooks busy and inactive, I thought this was a nice achievement :)} 27. f3 {maybe f3 was a mistake.  g3 just to limit the bishop's movement would be better?} Bf4 {.} 28. g4 {.} Kh7 {.} 29. Rg1 {.} Ra7a4 {Ra4 - what was the point of this move?? Moving into dead end, just loosing time?} 30. gxh5 {.} gxh5 {so now I have created 2 isolated pawns and one is fixed on black square h4, where it can be attacked by bishop, but on the other hand my rook has the only open file.} 31. Rdd1 {yes, the Rd3 was a waste of time.} Kh6 {.} 32. Rg2 {.} Bc7 {f4 pawn sacrifice could also work out.} 33. Rdg1 {.} Bd8 {.} 34. Rg2g7 {At this point I thought I was doing well, but maybe this was a big mistake? I thought I was going to exchange h4 to f7 pawn to have more space for my rooks, maybe even create some vague mating threats (if black moves f7 pawn then R1g6#: of course that's too obvious, but at least it limits some of the black's options).} Ra4a7 {.} 35. Rg7g8 {.} Bxh4 {.} 36. Rxa8 {I decided to exchange rooks, so I get the a3 pawn and threaten b5, but maybe I should not have exchanged rooks, what do you think?} Rxa8 {.} 37. Nxa3 {so we have exchanged a3 and h4 pawns. I guess the last few moves were the decisive mistake creating passed pawn h5, which I didn't manage to stop.} Rb8 {Here white could try Nxb5: knight for a pawn, but two connected passed pawns would be something, what do you think?} 38. Nc2 {.} Bg5 {.} 39. Rg2 {.} h4 {at this point I understood that h4 pawn is a real problem, for which I don't have a solution.} 40. Ne1 {.} Ra8 {.} 41. Nd3 {.} Kh5 {.} 42. Ne5 {.} Ra7 {.} 43. Rh2 {.} Bf4 {.} 44. Rh1 {.} Kg5 {.} 45. Nd3 {.} Bg3 {.} 46. f4+ {I was hoping that if black takes, then after exchange I would eliminate the most dangerous h pawn, but black was very careful.} Kf5 {.} 47. Nc5 {.} Kxf4 {.} 48. a4 {.} bxa4+ {.} 49. Nxa4 {.} Kf3 {.} 50. b5 {.} Kg2 {.} 51. b6 {b6 was brave, I saw the winning exchange of rooks, but actually that was a mistake, black can just 51. ... Rxa4! and white pawn stays on b file, where b8 is covered by bishop.} Rb7 {.} 52. Rb1 {.} h3 {.} 53. c4 {.} dxc4+ {.} 54. Kxc4 {.} h2 {.} 55. Kc5 {.} h1=Q {.} 56. Rxh1 {.} Kxh1 {.} 57. Kc6 {.} Rb8 {.} 58. b7 {.} Rd8 {.} 59. Kc5 {.} Kg2 {.} 60. Nb6 {.} Kf3 {.} 61. Nc4 {.} Rd5+ {Losing another pawn, time to resign, all hope is lost :)  I think I played a pretty decent game, holding on for some 60 moves against a player who is rated 468 points higher, or maybe he just didn't press for a quick win, what do you think?}
