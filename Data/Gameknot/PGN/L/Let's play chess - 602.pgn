[Opening "Caro-Kann (B10), Hillbilly attack"]

1. e4 {this game was decided by a decisive attack against the white king due to   1.concentration of forces on the kingside, which allows you to sac material and still have enough force. 2.The fact that the king had no pieces really guarding it. } c6 {the caro kann defence. A rock solid opening that gives black a good game where he can get active pieces.} 2. Bc4 {I have played caro kann for 3 years in Class C-B level chess otb, but I haven't encountered this before. More common is maybe 2.d4 d5 and now 3.e5 Bf5 is the advance variation, 3.exd5 cxd5  4.c4 Nf6 is the panov attack, and 4.Bd3 Nc6  5.c3 Nf6 is common too. Others include the caro kann 2 knights and 2.c4, which I have played against sometimes.} d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bb3 Nf6 {just developing.} 5. h3 {A waste of tempo. White cannot be thinking of a kingside attack and no piece is going to g4.} Nc6 6. Nf3 Bf5 {my minor pieces get good posts, and I am half a tempo up in development.} 7. d3 e5 {and now I get my pawn center. White must challenge it if he expects to reach a playable middlegame.} 8. O-O Bd6 {developing} 9. Nc3 {Attacking the d pawn, and taking advantage of the fact that I blocked my queen with my bishop.} e4 {open lines when up in development.} 10. dxe4 dxe4 11. Nd2 O-O {development is just about finished. I am 1.5 tempi up in development, because he needs 2 moves to get his dark bishop out.} 12. Nd5 Re8 13. Qe2 Nxd5 14. Bxd5 Re5 {activating my rook, which will be an important piece. I am now trying to turn kingside pressure into an attack with a sacrifice.} 15. Bb3 Qh4 {development completed, with all pieces (except the a8 rook) active and ready to participate in the attack.} 16. Nc4 Nd4 17. Qd1 {I think this is bad, but maybe other alternatives fail as well.} Rd5 {with the obvious, but devastating threat of Nf6ch,winning.} 18. Qe1 {What do you think I played now?} Nf3+ {Nf6ch anyways!} 19. gxf3 Bxh3 {And now, I have 2 main threats that can't be met.  1.Bg2  2.Rg5ch} 20. Ne3 Rg5+ 21. Kh1 Bc8# {mate.}
