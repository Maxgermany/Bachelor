1. h4 {"Crustacean."  Opening with the rook pawns is generally considered fairly weak, as it does not contribute to controlling the center of the board. } f5 {King's bishop pawn is the weakest opening.  I generally answer h4 with d5, unleashing the queen's bishop against the white rook should he be so foolish as to commit Rh3 (move 8).} 2. Nc3 h6 3. a4 g6 {Ugh.  Better would be e6 or e7, which releases the king's bishop against Ra3 (which white does in move 12).  So far black has developed three pawns on the king's side, but established very little control over the center of the board.  Plus pg6 is undefended and makes Rh8 vulnerable to a bishop attack. } 4. e3 e6 5. Bb5 c6 6. Bc4 Bg7 7. Qf3 e5 8. Rh3 e4 {This move isn't necessarily bad, it strengthens black's pawn structure while pushing the white queen.  If white moves Qg3, black's pawn at g6 will be undefended.  Protecting it with the queen (Qf6) blocks the black bishop, while Ne7 (move 9) restricts the queens movement.} 9. Qg3 Ne7 10. Qd6 Be5 {?  The black bishop is undefended.  The white queen may snatch it gratis (free of charge), and threaten the h8 rook.} 11. Qxe5 Rf8 12. Ra3 d6 13. Qf4 d5 14. Bb3 Be6 15. a5 Nc8 16. Qxh6 Qf6 17. Ra4 Ne7 18. Rg3 Ng8 {Oops, that knight was the only thing protecting the pawn at g6.  I would expect white to answer with Qxpg6+.  Sure, QxQ, then RxQ threatens the black bishop.} 19. Qf4 Ne7 20. Qc7 Kf7 21. Rd4 {?  QxPb7 is a better move for white, forcing black to move the b8 knight or sacrifice the a8 rook.} f4 {Excellent move.  Pe3xPf4 results in QxRd4.  On the other hand, Rh3 would be answered by BxRh3.  Sweet!} 22. Rh3 Rc8 {?  This seems to force white to take the b7 pawn.} 23. Qd6 {...or not.} Bxh3 {Finally!  Black doesn't quite regain the material advantage, after NxB, but the rook certainly helps.} 24. Qc5 {White's advantage would have been QxQ+, then eating the bishop later.} Nd7 25. Qb4 {This is a TERRIBLE move for white, as Pc5 forks white's rook and queen, with the pawn protected by both the knight at d7 and the c8 rook.} Qxh4 {I would have pulled the bishop out of harm's way, personally, if I wasn't into slaying another white rook.} 26. gxh3 {Och.  This breaks white's pawns, while leaving the knight on the back row.  NxB I think would have been better, as it would then threaten the f4 pawn.} b5 {?  That was the wrong pawn.  It is vulnerable to en passant, though white might choose not to take it. } 27. Qa3 c5 {Yes.  Sweet!} 28. exf4 Qxf4 {Ok, I guess black can delay the satisfaction of slaughtering the white rook another move.} 29. Bxd5+ {...or not.} Ke8 30. a6 Rab8 {PxR?} 31. Rxe4 {Now it is too late.} Qd6 32. Rh4 Qh2 33. Rh8+ Nf8 34. Qa5 Qxg1+ 35. Ke2 Qg5 36. d4 Qf6 37. Ne4 Qb6 {?  The pawn at d4 was undefended.  Taking it then threatens white's bishop.} 38. Qc3 Qxa6 39. Bh6 b4+ {RxN+} 40. Qd3 c4 41. Qf3 c3+ 42. Ke3 Kd7 43. Qg4+ Ne6 44. Rh7 Rce8 {Moving the rook here doesn't help protect the knight, plus the rook will be lost by an Nf6+ fork.  White sees this on move 46.} 45. Bb3 Rb6 {Hm.  At this point I'm liking PxPb2, setting black up for pawn promotion to queen.  White could interfere with Qd1, answered by black with Qa1.  QxQ, PxQ.  Good times!} 46. Nf6+ Kd8 47. bxc3 {The pawn?  The rook is more valuable, though it isn't going anywhere.  It remains edible.} Nf8 48. Rg7 {Rf7 MIGHT be better, in that the rook could not be threatened by a subsequent knight move.} Rxf6 {:)  Good move!} 49. Bf4 Ne6 50. Bd5 {Ok, the white rook is vulnerable.} Nf5+ {...but it can wait.} 51. Ke4 Nexg7+ {Really nice.} 52. Be5 Qe2+ {Ugh.  Nothing protects the black queen there.} 53. Qxe2 Nd6+ 54. Kd3 Rf5 55. Qd1 Rxf2 56. Qg4 Ngf5 {Decent.  This protects against Qh4+, giving white the rook at f2.} 57. Qxg6 {}
