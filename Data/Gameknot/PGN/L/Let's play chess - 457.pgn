1. d4 {.White just blundered a piece right in the opening phase (move 6), but still managed to drag the game for 25 more moves, I've done some massive exchanges, but white defended stubbornly and forced me to play almost to mate (a mate in one in the last position)...} Nf6 {My usual reply to d4} 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 {The more flexible option, fianchetto the bishop, just leaving to white the definition of his pieces to chose a way to contest them latter} 4. Nc3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. e4 Nxc3 {So here we have a Gr√ºnfeld modern exchange variation... without the exchange part... as white didn't captured back??} 7. Qd3 {?? blunders a piece, obviously bxc3 is clearly better than the game's move} Na4 8. Be2 Nc6 {to develop my pieces} 9. Be3 Bg4 10. Rb1 Bxf3 {and cash in my material advantage, by exchanging as many pieces as I can} 11. Bxf3 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 Bxd4 {massive exchanges to simplify the position} 13. Qb5+ Qd7 14. Qxb7 O-O {connecting rooks Rab8 follows getting my pawn back} 15. O-O Rab8 16. Qa6 Rxb2 {I don't mind exchanging rooks} 17. Rbd1 {trying to pin my bishop} Nc3 {unpinning my bishop with a threat over a2} 18. Rda1 Rb6 {chasing away the  queen is my priority now to consolidate the position} 19. Qc4 c5 {more consolidation and white's queen is traped} 20. a3 {?} Qb5 {now forcing the exchange of queens} 21. Qxb5 Nxb5 {recaptures the queen and attacks the rook} 22. h4 {?? blunders a quality to my discovered attack} Bxa1 23. Rxa1 Nd4 24. Rc1 Nxf3+ {No need to worry about the c pawn as I'm exchanging with check which allows the defence of the c pawn latter} 25. gxf3 Rc8 {The best placement for my rook is behind the pawn, and it will stay there, while the other rook will force it's advance to promotion} 26. Rc4 Rb3 {now the advance of the c pawn is decisive I expect 27.a4 Rb4 gains a pawn, or if 27.Ra4 Rc7 defending both black pawns a7 and c5} 27. Ra4 Rc7 {defending both pawns} 28. Kf1 c4 29. Ke1 c3 {and the promotion is inevitable} 30. Kd1 {White's king walk to the promotion square is of no use as it only shortens the win} c2+ 31. Kd2 c1=Q+ {and mate in 1, the bad 7.Qd3?? sealed the fate of white on this game.  Some bad choices of moves, including an easy recapture that didn't happened allowed for a small material advantage, easily converted in to a won endgame.}
