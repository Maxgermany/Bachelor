1. e4 {Kings pawn.} e5 2. Qh5 {Looks like scholars mate to me. Kind of ironic that he played this move as I had just watched a video about how to stop scholars mate.} Nc6 {Instead of attacking his queen with my g pawn I protect my e pawn. g6 would allow his queen to take my e5 pawn with check and forking my rook on h8.} 3. Bc4 {Part of the scholars mate set up. Allows him to back up his queen. 4. Qxf7#} g6 {Now attack the queen.} 4. Qf3 {Still has the threat of checkmate on f7.} Nf6 {Scholars mate stoped.} 5. d3 h5 {This was a mistake. I should have played h6 instead and my life would have been a lot easier.} 6. h3 Bc5 {Preparing to castle.} 7. Bg5 {Pins my knight to my queen. This will be a thorn in my side for several moves.} Be7 {Protecting my queen but not sure of my purpose.} 8. Bxf7+ {Not allowing me to castle.} Kxf7 {Now pins the knight to my king. The knight on f6 is double pined.} 9. Ne2 b6 {So I can bring my white bishop out.} 10. c4 d6 {A good bishop.} 11. O-O {Brings his king to safety.} Ba6 12. a3 b5 {Going to try and relieve some pressure in my position.} 13. a4 {Why not just a4 in move 12?} bxc4 {Creating myself a half open b file.} 14. dxc4 Bxc4 15. Nec3 {I'm not sure what his purpose was in this move. If he needed a knight there why not Nbc3?} Bxf1 {Happy to trade up.} 16. Kxf1 Nd4 {Attacking his queen to remove that double fork he has me in.} 17. Qd1 Nxe4 {Attacking his bishop with my bishop and queen.} 18. Nxe4 Bxg5 19. Nxg5+ Qxg5 {I traded a lot of material to get out of my bad position. I'm still up a rook!} 20. Kg1 {What did he see here that spooked his king? Maybe he hoped I would play Nf3  so he could take it with his queen and check me. This in my opinion cost him the game.} Rab8 {Attacking the b2 pawn for a full open file.} 21. Qd2 {Wanting to trade queens or protecting his b pawn. I think he wants to trade.} Nf3+ {A royal fork! He can't capture my knight with 22. gxf3 because the g pawn is pined to the king.} 22. Kh1 Nxd2 {Now I will trade my knight for your queen and knight..} 23. Nc3 Rxb2 {I probably should have attacked his rook with my knight.} 24. Rg1 Ke6 {Trying to open the f file.} 25. Nb5 {Attacking the c pawn with check.} Rxb5 {I know this is trading down and could have avoided the trade with Kd7 but I felt that his knight would give me trouble down the road. I decided to trade my rook to simplify the position.} 26. axb5 {He gladly accepts.} e4 {Probably not my best move but I wanted that pawn. The pawn was a sitting duck if he would have moved it.} 27. Re1 Qxb5 28. f3 Nxf3 {I probably shouldn't have done that. As it were his pawn would have been a better blocker for my king than my pawn would.} 29. Rxe4+ Kd5 {Here it's mate in one if he doesn't play it right.} 30. gxf3 {He sees the mate in one.} Qf1+ {Now I'm after that rook.} 31. Kh2 {His only move.} Qf2+ {Checking him again to set up a fork.} 32. Kh1 Qxf3+ {Taking the f pawn and forking the king and rook. I couldn't have taken the rook with 31. ... Qxf3. He would have been able to move out of the way.} 33. Kg1 Qxe4 {Taking the rook and opening the f file.} 34. Kf1 Rf8+ {Driving the king to the corner.} 35. Kg1 Qe2 {Keeping the king in a tiny square.} 36. Kh1 Rf1# {Checkmate. Black wins. This was a good game for me. It allowed me to see some mistakes I've made. mpinck seems to be a better player that this game shows. If you would take out the opening of just trying to trap a checkmate for easy win and put in some development I think he would have won.}
