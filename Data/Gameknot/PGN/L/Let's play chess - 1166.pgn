1. e4 e5 2. f4 Nc6 3. Nf3 d6 4. fxe5 dxe5 5. Bc4 Be6 6. Bxe6 fxe6 7. O-O Bc5+ 8. Kh1 Nf6 9. d3 Ng4 {I don't remember why I did this.  I had great position in the center of the board.  Must have been anxious to move into the midgame.} 10. Bg5 {Should have seen that coming with the previous pawn move.  It wasn't just to protect e4 from my knight.} Qd6 11. Nfd2 {I don't know why he did that, but it turned out great for him.  That knight is what really began my problems.} Ne3 {I thought it was a good move...} 12. Bxe3 {It wasn't} Bxe3 {I suppose I could pretend it was an even trade...} 13. Nc4 {But it wasn't, opened me up to a fork on my queen and the bishop.} Qc5 {I could delay it...} 14. Nc3 {I knew he was going after my queen, she was not properly developed.} O-O-O {Should have moved my bishop at this point... dunno where though.  Probably f4.} 15. Na4 Qb5 {Best move at the time, if I had seen the whole of the game I would have realized that I was not just saving my queen, but threatening an exchange for my bishop.  But I wasn't paying enough attention.} 16. b3 {Didn't want to lose his knight quite yet.  Good idea.} Nd4 {Again, should have moved my bishop.  I was thinking that by moving my knight, I would have more room for my queen to flee if need be.} 17. Nxe3 {Good move.} Qc6 {Attacking c2, and moving a little further from the situation, sounded like the best idea.} 18. Nc4 {I assume that he moved his knight here to take e5, threatening the queen, or maybe just negating the attack on c2...  either way, I got no options.} a6 19. Nxe5 Qxc2 20. Nf7 Qxd1 21. Raxd1 b5 22. Nc5 Rhe8 {Had to choose, Rd was 'defended' by my K, if you will, so I decided to offer that one.} 23. Nxd8 Kxd8 {The N is dead!  Ha!...  10 moves and 5 points later.  } 24. Nxa6 g5 25. Rf7 {Has he gotten a little greedy, or has he moved into end-game, leaving me in the dust?} h5 26. Rxc7 g4 {26. Rxc7 g4  27. Rh7 Ne2  28. Rxh5 g3  29. hxg3 Nxg3   highly unlikely... ? if his R doesn't come to h, then mine can, threatening mate} 27. Rf1 {ok, so we are in the end-game now... if I had seen that, I wonder if I could have prevented it. if I don't protect 8 (f8), that is mate. if R stays at e8, then white R at d7 is mate. moving R-h8 saves me, but I have a one move cushion.} h4 28. Rff7 Rh8 29. Rfd7+ {not unexpected... but now i see the fork on N... !} Ke8 30. Rxd4 {I see nothing, considering resigning... but may as well keep going, hoping for a mistake} g3 31. Rc8+ Kf7 32. Rxh8 {It's too painful to look at every time I log on... I have to resign.  I must remember where I messed up.   Over and over I thought I had an additional cushion before I had to retreat.  Over and over I was wrong.  I needed to be just a little more cautious in about 4 or 5 moves, and I wouldn't have needed to resign.}
