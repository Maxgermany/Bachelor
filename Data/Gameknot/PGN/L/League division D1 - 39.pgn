[Opening "King's Indian (E75), Averbakh, main line"]

1. d4 Nf6 {Keeps options open: KID, Gruenfeld Def, Nimzo- or Bogo-Indians, Benoni, Slav, belated QGD and many others are all possible by transposition. Main immediate thing is that this denies White of 2.e4.} 2. c4 g6 {Narrowing to KID, Gruenfeld, Benoni or Queen's Indian complex (to name the major ones).} 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {Black has made the normal first few moves for a KID, moves which can usually be played in almost any order.  Move order *can* be used by Black to limit/allow various methods of advance by White, but this is generally a very subtle finesse. For instance, Black can castle instead of playing ...d6, inviting White to advance the pawn to e5 hitting the N which then drops back to e8. White will then attack to use his center as an aggressive weapon (the Classical idea), and Black will defend to demonstrate how White's center is actually overextended and weak (the Hypermodern idea). Neither side is "right" it's just a matter of taste (especially at a level below GM).} 5. Be2 {"Threatening" the Averbahk variation of the KID, thought classical mainlines are still available to White. At this 5th} O-O 6. Bg5 {Averbakh Variation proper} c5 7. d5 h6 8. Be3 Nbd7 {8...e6 is usually necessary trading a set of pawns and giving Black much needed space.} 9. Qd2 h5 {Kh7 is more solid. This move leaves the dark squares weak and stiffles prospects for Blacks counter-play.  Black is starting to have problems from here.} 10. h3 {Keeping a Black piece out of g4, White can now just develop normally (Nf3, O-O, maybe even with f4) for a clear plus.  At Master level White might even be near winning here.  At class level White at least has the much easier game.} Nb6 {Again, Black had to fashion some sort of strategy for counterplay, like opening lines with ...e6 at all costs.  The N on b6 is pointless.} 11. f4 e6 12. Nf3 Nh7 {...exd would at least let Black play something like ...Qc7 and ...c4 with the N back to d7 where it should already be and then to c5.  Decentralizing the N makes things even worse.} 13. O-O {White is now very safe, has more space, and has all the options of how to proceed against Blacks weaknesses.} Bd7 14. Rad1 {Not yet really threatening dxe and Qxd because the pawn on c4 needs support first, but the R is well placed opposite the Black Q anyway.} Rc8 15. e5 {White has the best position possible, so he must now bust in and clean up.} dxe5 16. fxe5 f5 {Trying for K-side space, not a bad idea but very late.} 17. Bf4 {too early for 17.d6, because ...Bc6, 18.Bf5 BxN 19.BxB Rb8 and Black is ready for ...Nd7 blockading and hitting e5 again, as well as ideas with pawn to g5->g4 and an attack.  Black could come back to life if White trades in his bind for a protected passer so easily.} a6 {Black has no decent moves so he "prepares" for the distant future.} 18. Rfe1 {White does not need to rush as Black cannot improve his weaknesses. No need to advance the center or take in the center.  Better to get the rook behind Whites one weak pawn, consolidate the Q-side, maybe even get Blacks QN to an even worse square, stop all K-side counterplay, then finally win in the center.  White has all the time in the world, but Black can only shuffle planlessly and try to create superficial tactics.} Qe7 {now the eventual pawn push to d6 will come with tempo, but still no need to cash in just yet.} 19. b3 Rf7 20. a4 Na8 {There we go.  Finally time for central action.  White is playing with at least 2 extra Knights in the central push.} 21. d6 Qe8 {Nd5 could be possible here, but why not stiffle Blacks K-side counter attack first?  Never give your opponent any play that they don't deserve.} 22. h4 {Now any ideas like ...g5 after the N sac are out of the question.} Bc6 {Whites position was built up methodically over 22 moves, with hardly any tactics whatsoever. But as usual, tactics are necessary to cash in the advantage and actually win the game. there are simply no more preparatory moves for White to make, so he needs to trade the scaple for the hammer.} 23. Nd5 {The sac isn't so brave.  The positional factors are worth much more than one Knight.} exd5 24. cxd5 {Trying to keep the saced material is obviously doomed.  Not only pawn to e7 and then to d7, but Bc4 is coming to pin something and game over.} Bxa4 {Black gives the piece back for 2 pawns and an opened up Q-side with passers, but he has no time at all to activate the rest of his army.} 25. bxa4 Qxa4 26. e6 c4 {Maybe the best try for counterplay, but losing the R is too much.} 27. exf7+ Kxf7 28. Ne5+ {either the c pawn or Blacks B leave the board, so the extra R will win quickly.  Black resigned.}
