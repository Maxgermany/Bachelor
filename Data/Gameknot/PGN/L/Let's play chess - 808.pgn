1. d4 e6 2. e4 Qf6 3. Nc3 Kd8 {3 ... c5 instead.} 4. Nf3 h5 {4 ... h6 was necessary} 5. Bg5 Bb4 6. Bxf6+ gxf6 7. Bc4 c6 8. d5 {breaking open lines is the easiest way to win games in which one is up big material} b5 9. Bb3 a6 10. dxe6 Nh6 11. exf7 Nxf7 12. Bxf7 d5 13. exd5 Ke7 14. Be6 Bb7 15. O-O Nd7 16. dxc6 Bxc6 17. Bxd7 Bxd7 18. Nd5+ Kd8 19. Nxb4 a5 20. Qd5 {attacking the rook and preparing to bring the rooks into play to finish this game quickly} Rc8 21. Rad1 Rc7 22. Na6 {some good horsing around here} Re8 23. Nxc7 Re7 24. Ne6+ {a very strong check} Ke8 25. Qa8+ {here black changed his time control to move/6.  is such a thing legal?  it seems that one should finish the game at the same time control one started with.  at any rate black is quite lost here and only prolongs when white will formally get the point.} Kf7 26. Qf8+ Kxe6 27. Rfe1+ {}
