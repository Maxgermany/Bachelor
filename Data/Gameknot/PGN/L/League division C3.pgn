[Opening "Bogo-Indian defence, Nimzovich variation (E11)"]

1. d4 {This game is a Bogo-Indian which features some key positional ideas for the Black pieces.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 {Here White wishes to avoid the Nimzo-Indian and is probably hoping for 3...b6 when the Queen's Indian Defense will lead him into lines where White has a good chance for a small but persistent advantage.} Bb4+ {I, however, prefer Efim Bogolubov's defense.} 4. Bd2 {Here White could transpose into the Nimzo-Kasparov Variation with 4. Nc3, however, this move and 6. Nbd2 keep things in Bogo territory.} Qe7 {The purpose of this move is two-fold, as it prevents the exchange of Bishops, after which White would lose a pawn, and it prepares an eventual e5, by playing Nc6, exchanging the Bishops and then playing d6 and finally e5, with active play on the kingside.} 5. g3 Nc6 {Black has a few options here, however, I like the consistency and straight forwardness of playing for a quick e5.} 6. Bg2 O-O {A slight inaccuracy on my part.  6...Bxd2 allows White the opportunity to play 7. Qxd2?! where after 7...Ne4 8.Qc2 Qb4 , White has to make some unpleasant choices;  1) 9. Kf1 d5 2) 9. Nc3 Nxc3 10. Qxc3 Qxc3 11. bxc3 b6 where White's weak pawn structure will be an endgame disadvantage. 3) 9. Nbd2 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 Qxc4 or 10. Nxd2 Nxd4 and White doesnt have sufficient compensation for the pawn.} 7. O-O Bxd2 {Why the exchange?  Black gets the opportunity to exchange of Bishop for Bishop, rather than Bishop for Knight, also the Queen's Knight will be less aggressively placed on d2.} 8. Nbxd2 {8. Qxd2 is parried with 8...Ne4 and ...f5 when Black has strong play on the Kingside.} d6 {Now we have transposed back to the main line.} 9. e4 e5 {The culmination of Black's opening strategy, he stakes a claim in the center and invites a closing of the position where Black's chances are at least equal to White's.} 10. d5 {After 10. de Nxe5, Black will follow up with ...b6 and ...Bb7 with an equal game.} Nb8 {Here is the Key position of the opening.  1) White's knight on d2 is misplaced, 2) White's bishop is hemmed in by it's center pawns; 3) Black is behind in development, however, the fact that the center is closed makes this a minor drawback.  Black indeed has a strategically sound position.} 11. b4 {White gains space on the Queenside and prepares the c5 advance.  11. Ne1 is another possibility.} a5 {Black is fighting for control of c5, which would make an ideal outpost for his Queens knight.} 12. a3 Na6 13. Qb3 {13. bxa5 allows the immediate 13...Nc5.} c6 14. Rfc1 {14. Ne1 is the strongest continuation, now Black takes control on the Queenside, with this instructive series of moves.} Bd7 15. Bf1 {Not sure what this move accomplishes.  15. dc bc 16. c5 is stronger, but Black is still equal.} axb4 {The purpose of this move is to create an outpost for the a6 knight on b4, where Nc2-d4 will be a constant threat.} 16. axb4 c5 17. b5 {If 17. bc, then the outpost is on c5.  Black has plenty of Queenside counterplay and plenty of good squares for his pieces.} Nb4 {White has to be on guard for a Nc2-d4 maneuver in the endgame.} 18. Ne1 {Probably planning to exchange the knight on b4, however, Black decides to open a second front on White's king, while the defenders are disorganized.} Ng4 19. f3 Qg5 {The knight on d2 is hanging, and after 20. fxg4 Qxd2 21. Rd1 Qg5 22. h3 h5, Black's attack looks strong.} 20. Rxa8 Rxa8 {Occupying an open file with the Rook, however, Fritz informed me after the game, that I missed 20...Qxd2 21. Rxf8  Kxf8 now white has to play 22. fxg4 and let the rook hang, as mate on h2 is being threatened.  Black will then pick up the pawn on g4 with a winning endgame.} 21. Qc3 Nf6 {In retrospect, 21...Nh6 might have been better, giving me the option of playing a quick f5.} 22. Rd1 Ra2 {That tasty, tasty 7th rank.} 23. Nd3 {Attempting to exchange the b4 knight, but he has overlooked a tactic.} Qe3+ {Crushing!!!} 24. Kg2 {Why not 24. Kh1?  Because of 24...Bg4 when 25. fxg4 leads to mate after 25...Nxe4 26. Nxe4 Qxe4  27. Kg1 Qf3  and White can resign.} Bg4 {The same idea applies.  Exploiting the pin on the d2 knight will prove decisive.  Really not a difficult move to find, especially if you have read David LeMoir's book "How to Become a Deadly Chess Tactician," which is filled with examples of passive sacrifices.} 25. fxg4 Nxe4 26. Qc1 {White is up a piece, but not for long.} Nxd3 27. Bxd3 Qxd3 {Now another piece drops and with it the game.}
