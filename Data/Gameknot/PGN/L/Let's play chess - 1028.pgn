1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Ne4 5. Nf3 h6 6. a3 c6 7. Bd3 {A move that I often like to play (results vary) even with out the knight there. Sensing a king side castle I pressure h7. Can be effective but sometimes attacking a well defended king becomes a losing proposition. Thoughts? } Nxc3 8. bxc3 Nd7 9. O-O f6 10. a4 a6 11. Nh4 fxe5 12. Qh5+ Ke7 13. Ng6+ Kf7 {Here is where the deviation occurs. From this point forward it's almost over. Had 13... Kd6 or even 14...Ke7 then 15...Kd6 I'm up in material but in analyzing the game later I couldn't find any clear and decisive victory as he artificially castles. My only option seemed to be to trade down and exercise piece advantage. Was glad for 14...Kg8 as it effectively ended the game, alot could have happened but he was running.  What I'm interested is the best response to ...Kd6 ...Kc7. Maybe it is to advance towards endgame. } 14. Nxh8+ Kg8 15. Qg6 Bd6 16. Bxh6 Kf8 17. Qf7# {Trying to move the bishop to escape didn't help. An earlier 15... Nf6 helps much more. Overall an interesting, if not silly, game. }
