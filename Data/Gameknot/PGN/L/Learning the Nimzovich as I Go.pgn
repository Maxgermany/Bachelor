[Opening "KP (B00), Nimzovich defence"]

1. e4 Nc6 2. Nf3 {Black chose the Nimzovich Defense. I don't know this one very well, so I'm winging it from my second move. I guess I'll learn it as I go...} a6 3. d4 {I suppose black's 2. ... a6 keeps me from transposing to the Ruy Lopez. A shame, because that's what I play for when black lets me.} d5 4. Nc3 dxe4 5. Nxe4 {White's development seems a little more effective than black's.} Bf5 6. Ng3 e6 7. Nxf5 {Seems to give me a 2-bishops advantage, however small that is at the moment, and it doubles black's pawns.} exf5 8. Bc4 Be7 9. Bf4 {Developing without a serious plan of attack yet.} Nf6 10. O-O b5 11. Bb3 {I like the pressure on f7 more than I like the weak threat that 11. Bd3 makes against the easily defended f5 pawn.} h6 12. c3 {You never know when your bishop might need a bolt-hole in a pinch. And I plan to make some attacks with the queen, which would leave d4 weak so this move shores it up.} a5 13. Qd3 {Forks the unprotected pawns at b5 and f5. I was hoping black would advance that a-pawn. And now I'm glad d4 is defended and that my bishop has somewhere to flee.} Rb8 14. Qxf5 {Might as well eat when the snack is free.} g6 15. Qd3 a4 16. Bc2 {I guess it's good I made that bolt-hole, because now the bishop needs to bolt!} Nd5 17. Be5 {Keeps the pressure on c7 and threatens black's rook on h8. I expect black to trade here, and after I recapture with my knight I will be threatening the fork with Nc6.} Bf6 18. Bxf6 Qxf6 19. Ne5 {Black's a big old plan-spoiler. Oh well, I traded, which is fine while I'm up by a pawn. Let's trade again. Black should not try to win his pawn back by 19. Nxe5 20. Pxe5 Qxe5?? since then 21. R(either)e1 wins black's queen.} Nf4 20. Qe4 {Now I'm threatening Nxc6  (discovered check) which wins the knight for free and also wins the exchange with black's rook on b8.} Nxe5 21. Qxe5+ {Black was having none of my tricks, so I might as well trade queens and start heading toward a pawn-advantage endgame.} Qxe5 22. dxe5 O-O 23. g3 {Positionally, we seem to be about dead even, save for my pawn at e5. Truth is, I had no real idea how to proceed from here. I'm thinking along lines of occupying the open d-file with my rooks, supporting the pawn with rooks and bishop, and trying to crack through the kingside with a 4-to-3 pawn advantage, taking opportunities along the way to liquidate pieces. That's a lot to digest, and I'm not yet sure how I will put all that together - or if black will accomodate me.} Ne6 24. Rad1 {Step 1, accomplished.} h5 25. Rd5 {Step 2, underway, with abit of pressure on b5, holding black's rook to defense and also threatening a little fun with Bd3, which pretty much forces black to respond with b4 and after we exchange pawns, white's queenside looks more secure than black's. This might lead me down a whole alternative path from what I anticipated a couple moves ago - maybe I might find a good queenside attack instead.} c5 26. Rfd1 {Doubled rooks on the open file.} Rbe8 27. f4 {Black's move seemed a bit odd. It trapped his 2nd rook on f8, effectively limiting his options. But it indirectly threatens my pawn on e5 so I decide to defend it, and simultaneously deprive the black knight of g5.} g5 28. f5 {Black tried to break up my pawn structure. Taking the g5 pawn would have been a big mistake, stranding my e-pawn all by itself. Besides, I found a much better move. Now black must save his knight. I am expecting 28. Ng7 to attack my pawn at f5, and considering 29. f6 Ne6, 30. Bf5 to trade knights and win the black pawn at c5 unless black replies 30. ... Rc8 to which I reply 31. Rd7 and 32. R(1)d6 and black's e6 pawn should fall - if not, he's all tied up on defense leaving my king free to munch his kingside pawns.} Nc7 29. Rxc5 {Black again foiled my plans, but in the process he fed me another pawn snack.} Rec8 30. Rd7 {Rc8 scared me a little. A discovered attack against my undefended rook - until I realized his knight had no attack of its own. A discovered attack that doesn't create a 2nd threat isn't really hard to refute, so I gang up on the knight. Black cannot defend it, so he must move it - but he can't move it because it defends the b5 pawn. Zugswang! Well, not exactly, but how often do I get to say such a fun word?} Na6 31. Rxb5 {With three pawns in my belly, I'm feeling quite confident about the outcome now. } Nc5 32. Ra7 {But four would be better! I thought long and had about this one. I am giving up the d-file and black can get ahold of it with 32. ... R(f)d8. Then 33. Bxa4 Rd2 locks my king down - if I chase the rook, I lose the pawn at h2. If I don't, I risk him getting his 2nd rook to, say, e1 for checkmate. I worked out the various combinations and decided he didn't have enough to make it happen, so I'll hunt his last queenside pawn and plan to promote lots of pawns this game.} f6 33. e6 {Passed pawn! Only two squares to go...} g4 34. Bxa4 Nxa4 35. Rxa4 {I didn't expect the knight-for-bishop trade while black is suffering such a pawn deficit. However, it does eliminate my light-colored bishop who, after eating the pawn at a4, was covering e8 where that pawn wants to promote.} Rcb8 36. Rxb8 {I really didn't expect the rook exchange.} Rxb8 37. c4 {I don't even need to worry about the pawn at b2 quite yet. Black has to play 37. ... Kf8 before his rook can eat my pawns.} Rxb2 38. Ra8+ {See? With the king deprived of f7, he cannot approach the passed e-pawn to prevent it from promoting now.} Kg7 39. e7 {Pawn on the 7th, promotion square covered, all black can do is play 39. ... Re2 to kill the queen and go on to lose a hopeless endgame. If 39. .. Rb1 ?, 40. Kf2 and now the black rook cannot safely stop the pawn promotion. 40. ... Rb2 , 41. Ke3 and now black runs out of checks.} Rxa2 40. e8=Q {Black snuck a pawn from me. 40. Rxa2 is a certain win, but it does lose my chance to immediately promote at e8 (I could just let the e-pawn fall, plant my rook on d2 and safely promote my c-pawn where black's king cannot touch it). But as played, White threatens mate in 1 with 41. Qg6   so black must capture white's rook, and having queen and pawn against king sounds like more fun than just rook and pawn.} Rxa8 41. Qxa8 Kh6 42. Qg8 {41. ... Kf7 would have been much better. I think black was hoping I would stalemate him. The first thing I thought of was 42. Qg8 to lock down his king, then I thought I was giving him the stalemate he wanted, until I realized that his h5 pawn could move. So, I play the first move of a 2-move forced mate that black offered me when he trapped his king on h6.} h4 43. Qg6# {Final Position.}
