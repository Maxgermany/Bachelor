1. e4 {nice game with turn-over situations, attack and defence from side to side ending with an assault on the king side which leads to an material advantage and possibility to promote.} b6 2. Nc3 Bb7 3. d4 {taking the center} e6 {discovers bishop and queen, or taking the center back with f5 or d5} 4. a3 Ne7 {didn't expect that} 5. Be2 Ng6 6. Nh3 {develop and make room for castling} d6 7. Bh5 Be7 8. Nf4 {in case of refusing exchange then Qg4 ~ putting pressure and possible wining a pawn, but most, making damage on king side !} Nxf4 {take} 9. Bxf4 Nd7 10. Bf3 {nothing left there to do ...} c6 11. Ne2 Qc7 12. Qd2 O-O-O 13. O-O h6 14. Qc3 {threatening g7} g5 {there it goes my threat, threatening me back} 15. Be3 f5 {this is not good, my king side will be exposed} 16. g4 {taking measures} f4 17. Bd2 Bf6 18. Rfe1 {a movement unnecessary, for future develop but future is far and my queen is pined by that bishop} c5 19. Qc4 {threatening e6} cxd4 20. Qxe6 {grab the pawn, going for Qxc2 will leave behind d6} Kb8 {surprise move} 21. Bb4 {threatening Bxd6 and pin the queen to it's doom} Be5 {protecting the pin but now his bishop is pined on that position so taking with knight on d4 is safe,  i dont know why he did not attack my queen so far with rock } 22. Nxd4 Nc5 {I thought for a while to catch the knight, but I fell back} 23. Qc4 Rdc8 24. Bc3 Qh7 {nice move, discover attack from knight on c5 and nothing to stop him capturing the pawn on e4 witch has 3 pieces on him !!} 25. Nf5 {at least what i could do, threatening pawn on d6 and stopping his queen} Nxe4 26. Qd3 {avoid the rock} Nxc3 27. Bxb7 {grab the bishop first} Kxb7 28. bxc3 {taking back material} Rxc3 29. Nxd6+ {strong move, if he takes with the bishop his rock is mine, anywhere he goes with the king away from my knight i take his queen Qxh7, he takes mine Rxh7 then i take his bishop Rxe5 !} Kc7 {now i did not expect that, giving me the chance to fork the rock and the king} 30. Nb5+ Kb7 31. Nxc3 Qxd3 {reasonably, he takes my knight Bxc3 forking my rocks but they are safe because i leave with Re1-Re7 check} 32. cxd3 Bxc3 33. Re7+ {as predicted} Ka6 34. Rb1 Rd8 35.
