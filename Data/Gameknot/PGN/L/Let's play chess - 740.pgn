[Opening "French (C02), advance, Paulsen attack"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {I thought that I'd try something new.  I've tried pretty much everything against the French over the years.  The King's Indian Attack with 2. d3 is fine but if Black exchanges on e4 it's hard to make much of it for White.  3. Nd2 c5 didn't agree with me, and 3. Nc3 Nf6 (and particularly 4. Bg5 Bb4) didn't much either.  I won some lovely short games in the Winawer and played 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Nge2 with some success when it was fashionable, but never this.  Hey ho.} c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Nh6 {Didn't see that coming.  Surely it can't be good?  According to the World data base, Black is scoring well in this line. } 6. Bxh6 gxh6 {An interesting reversal of the normal French strategy - White gives up the bishop pair to spoil Black's pawn structure.  Can Black use the g-file?} 7. dxc5 {I think that this is a sensible move here - Be2, Bd3 and a3 look a bit insipid to me (and Black is scoring well there, again according to our trusty GK World Database).  Black's last suggests that he might want to play Bg7, so let's make him make a choice.} Bxc5 8. b4 Bf8 {Is Bb6 better?  After 9. b5, Black is still going backwards.} 9. Bb5 Bd7 {9. ... Bg7 10. 0-0 0-0 potentially leaves the Black king exposed if he ever wants to play ... f6 to attack the e5 pawn, but I would have thought that the Bishop wants to be on the a6-f1 diagonal.  } 10. Bxc6 Bxc6 11. a4 {So White has the knight pair to Black's two bishops, space on the Q-side, the e5 pawn might be a thorn in the Black position (and note that now he no longer has any knights, attacking it is not straight-forward, and the Black king is going to have to find a home. } Rg8 12. b5 Bd7 13. O-O Be7 {Both sides play natural moves, but Black has limited plans available.  He has to solve the problem of his king.} 14. Nbd2 Rc8 15. Qb3 h5 {Black actually has two bad bishops in this position and it's hard to see what he can do.} 16. c4 dxc4 17. Nxc4 {This exchange is ideal for White - it opens the d-file when Black's queen has nowhere to hide, brings the knight to bear on d6 and still keeps Black cramped.} h4 18. h3 {It seems sensible to stop any nasties.  I was looking at playing Nf3-d2-e4 and landing on d6 or f6.  Black's next is where it starts to go very wrong.} f6 {This goes horribly wrong, but Black's position has gone as far as it can.} 19. exf6 {Whether Black realised that 19. ... Bxf6 20. Nd6+ Kf8 21. Nxc8 Bxa1 22. Qxa3 allows White to extricate the knight and grab the bishop. } Bc5 20. f7+ {They say that the best way to refute a gambit is to give the material back.  It's an attack, it's an extra pawn, what do I want to do with it?} Kxf7 21. Nfe5+ {Possibly the last choice for White - I thought that f3 might be useful for the queen.} Ke7 22. Rad1 {Now 22. ... Rc7 is the only move to defend the Bd7, but Black is pinned every which way.  23. Qf3 ratchets up the tension to breaking point - Qe8 (to stop Qh5) might be met with exchanging twice on d7 and simply replacing the Ne5 and Rd1 with their colleagues.  Instead, Black self-destructs.} Rxg2+ 23. Kxg2 Qg8+ 24. Kh1 Qg5 25. Rxd7+ Kf6 26. Rf7# {}
