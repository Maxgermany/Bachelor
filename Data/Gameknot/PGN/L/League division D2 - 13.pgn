[Opening "Sicilian (B96), Najdorf, 7.f4"]

1. e4 {Here's a nice win from a familiar opening, using a well-known thematic sacrifice.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The Najdorf Sicilian.  I continue with my revived interest in 6. Bg5.} 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qc7 8. Qf3 b5 9. Bd3 b4 {I think this is probably premature.  Black needs to get his King to safety and develop his pieces.} 10. Nd5 {!? A speculative sacrifice as I didn't have a concrete plan in mind.  But I knew this move was thematic from past studies of games by Velimirovic, Ljubojevic and Gligoric, to name a few Yugoslavians of the 70s who indulged in this line.} exd5 11. Bxf6 {White takes the opportunity to damage Black kingside pawn structure} gxf6 12. O-O-O {Castling queenside quickly centralises White's QR and prepares for further line-opening.} Bg7 13. exd5 Nd7 {I think castling immediately would have been better.  Now Black's king is trapped in the centre.} 14. Rhe1+ Kd8 15. Qh5 {White homes in on the weak f7 pawn but an immediate 15. Nc6+ would have been even stronger.} Nc5 {Black creates an escape square for his King but c8 would have been a better one.} 16. Nc6+ Kd7 17. Qxf7# {Very satisfying :-)}
