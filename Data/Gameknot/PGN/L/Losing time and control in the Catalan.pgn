1. Nf3 {Here is an interesting miniature just completed.  It turns out to be a Closed Catalan where black fianchettos the dark-squared bishop.  Without further ado...} Nf6 2. c4 {My standard response to the symmetrical knight development.  Black's flexibility with his first move allows for a light-square strategy along the lines of the Catalan/QGD, a symmetrical English, Queen's Indian or Kings Indian.} e6 {Black opts for the light-squared strategy.  An ambitious counter which prepares to directly challenge White in the center with ...d5 or ...c5.} 3. g3 {I tend towards the light-squard fianchetto in these positions, however, d4 and Nc3 are just as good.} d5 {The immediate strike in the center which characterizes the Catalan or Open Reti.} 4. Bg2 {4. d4 is objectively stronger, however, my preparation in the lines involving 4...dc; 5. Qc2 is pretty deep and so I dont mind going into those variations.} g6 {An interesting idea, but one which I believe wastes a tempo putting the bishop on the long diagonal, when it has a perfectly good diagonal on the a3-f8 line.} 5. d4 {I decide to fix the d-pawn and develop.} Bg7 {Following the plan and maintaining parity in development.} 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 c6 {Setting up the standard pawn formation for the closed Catalan.} 8. b3 {Here Bd2, and Re1 occurred to me, I decided to protect the pawn this way and maybe fianchetto my own dark-squared bishop.} Nbd7 9. Bf4 {Taking up residence on the diagonal which now cannot be easily countered.  I believe that this is the major drawback of the fianchetto strategy for black.  The central dark squares are now firmly under white's control.} b6 {A logical plan to give scope to the light-squared bishop which finds itself a victim of the pawn formation.} 10. Qd3 {Linking rooks and preparing e4.} a5 {10...Ba6 is probably better.} 11. e4 {A move on the wings is countered with a move in the center, which has been duly prepared!} dxe4 12. Nxe4 {I now expected 12...Nxe4 (to limit my influence on d6); 13. Qxe4 Bb7; 14. Rfd1, when White sits better.} Bb7 {Allowing me to drop the knight on d6 with tempo.} 13. Nd6 Ba6 14. Qe3 {Keeping the Queen centralized and preparing to swing the f-rook to d1.  I expected 14...Nh5; 15. Bg5 Ndf6; 16. Ne4 Ng4; 17. Qe2.} Ng4 {In this variation, the c6-pawn will find itself under pressure.} 15. Qe4 c5 {Regrettably, 15...Nb8 looked like the only way to save the pawn.  16. Nxf7 Rxf7; 17. Bxb8 leaves the knight on g4 hanging, so 17...Nf6; 18. Qxe6 Bc8 is necessary (otherwise 19. Ne5.); 19. Qd6 Rd7 and the position looks complicated, but it also looks pretty equal.} 16. Nxf7 {Now White is clearly better.} Rxf7 17. Ng5 {Threatening both rooks.} Rc8 18. Qxe6 {Two pawns for the piece and the pin, which I plan to increase the pressure with Bd5.} Qe7 19. Bd5 {Black resigns as White is coming out on top after exchanges or the capture of the g4 knight.  Thanks to my opponent.}
