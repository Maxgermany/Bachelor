[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 {usual first move e4-e5 (king's pawn game). I would of done b2-b3 (nimzo-larsen attack).} e5 {A great defense. I'm surprised she didn't played d7-d5 (Scandinavian defense).} 2. Nf3 {Ng1-f3 (king's knight game) the usual choice of most people. (I just joined on 5-10-10)} Nc6 {Knight's defense. what a great move for black.} 3. Bc4 {Bf1-c4 (giuoco piano) that is an Italian game.} d6 {A double philidor's defense } 4. O-O {Castling is a great move (for all the beginners in chess)} Bg4 {The knight on f3 is pinned. It can't move or else the bishop on g4 would capture the queen on d1.} 5. Nc3 {I brought my queen's knight out to start attacking on d5} Nf6 {Unfortunately, he defended...} 6. Nxe5 {I made a risk (and a plan!)} Bxd1 {She fell for it...} 7. Bxf7+ {This is nearly checkmate} Ke7 {What else could she do?} 8. g4 {I am overworking the knight.} Nxg4 {She just greedily grabbed it.} 9. Nd5# {Checkmate! (this is called a longer version of Legal's pseudo-sacrifice)   Moral: "Look both ways before you cross the street" Said by a chess grandmaster (Not me!)  I am sorry for my horrible English.}
