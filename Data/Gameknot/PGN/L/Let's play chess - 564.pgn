1. d4 f5 2. Bg5 {Dutch Bg5 variation} g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 6. e3 Ne4 {There is one game in the Gameknot database that gets to this position, personally I don't like this move however the black player in the other game was rated considerably higher than me so it must have some merit.} 7. Nxe4 fxe4 8. Nd2 {So overall now I am slightly ahead in development, black has doubled pawns on e which could result in a closed centre.} Bf6 {Loses a pawn. I am not going to take the bishop with mine} 9. Nxe4 Bf5 10. Nxf6+ exf6 11. Bh4 {Hoping to tempt black into g5 to open up his king side further} g5 12. Bg3 {I am very happy with my bishop here as I am expecting black to castle queen's side and th2-c8 is a nice diagonal for it then.} h5 13. h3 {I'm still not sure if I should have played h4 here but I was still looking at castling king side at this point} Nd7 14. Bd3 {Trying to remove blacks active bishop} Bxd3 15. Qxd3 {I now have the option of castling on either side} Qe7 16. O-O O-O-O {Now we have an interesting position. Blacks advanced pawns on the kings side could pose a threat so I need to make threats of my own queen side. I can feel a pawn storm coming on} 17. a4 h4 18. Bh2 Qf7 {To me Rg8 looks better} 19. b4 Nb6 20. Rfc1 {Lining my rook up with the black king as well as defending the c pawn. Would d5 have been better?} Rhe8 {This move is a mystery to me.} 21. a5 {So I carry on with my plan} Nd7 22. b5 c5 {This will give me a nice open line for my rooks and queen. it also fatally weakens the d6 pawn which is under threat from my dsb} 23. bxc6 e.p. bxc6 24. c5 {If dxc5 then I have Qa6#} Kb7 {Black has clearly seen the threat, would he have been better with Nb8?} 25. Rcb1+ Ka8 26. Bxd6 {Black is getting squeezed} Qd5 {This seems to me to be a mistake as it means the queen can no longer help the defence of the king. } 27. Rb6 {Offering the rook for the knight. Note that the rook is immune to the pawn due to axb6, axb6+, Kb7, Qa6#} Nxb6 28. axb6 Rd7 29. Qa6 {At this point I was starting to think that black might be able to avoid mate with Qf7} Ree7 {This is a fatal mistake for black} 30. Qc8# {Thanks for reading please leave comments.}
