[Opening "two knights defence (C58), Bogolyubov variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {The two knights defense is what I usually prefer to play as black. I started to play chess OTB between beginners and there kids are fond on Italian game. Though now I'm class 1, I still get to play this position often.} 4. Ng5 {This was exactly what I was waiting for. So far, so good.  I first saw this attack (4.Ng5) on a chess learning site for kids. I'm not sure wether it is true or not but the opening variation was there called Italian game, The Fried Liver attack. I have no idea how is this connected to fried liver, kidneys or any other organs.} d5 {The only reasonable response to the threat of 5.Nxf7.} 5. exd5 {When I was a bit younger, I used to play this attack with white. It's easy to win if you have an opponent that knows nothing about this opening. But, luckily I had played it much in OTB tournaments as black(and analyzed a little with some databases), so I knew that having your king in the center even with a piece up isn't very comfortable. White's idea is if I play 5. .. Nxd5, then he sacrifices a knight for a strong attack. 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3. If I play now 7. .. Ke8, then he retakes the knight 8.Bxd5 with a mate threat and has already taken the right to castle from me. If 7. .. Ke6, then he simply puts more pieces to attack to regain the material and perhaps create a mating net by developing his pieces with tempos, for example Nc3. All the time black has to defend his knight on d5 as well as his king which is drinven out in the center of the board.} Na5 {This probably is the most often played move.} 6. Bb5+ c6 {I could've played 6.Bd7, but I usually prefer to give up a pawn for a slight edge in development.} 7. dxc6 bxc6 8. Ba4 {Now this is a big mistake. The bishop may be attacking a weak pawn but actually this it is placed badly and is often a target to attack for black as it was in this game.} h6 9. Nf3 e4 {h6 and e4 are the usual moves while the white-squared white bishop is on e2 but now they also seemed suitable for driving the knight around the board while gaining space advantage.} 10. Ng1 {I couldn't figure it out why white didn't 10.Ne5 here to put more pressure on c6. Perhaps white was afraid of 10. .. Qd6 11. f/e4 Qb4 but now white can play 12.Nc3 and he doesn't lose a piece. Instead, he has a spare pawn while black has moved his queen more than once is starting to lose his advantage in development.} Bc5 {This is why 10.Ng1 was a bad move. White now has to defend from the threat of 11. .. Qd4 forking the bishop and f2. If the knight was elsewhere, white could easily castle now.} 11. h3 {This was a very poor move. White didn't see the threat of 11. .. Qd4. Perhaps this was meant to prevent 11. .. Bg4, but then there is 12.Ne2 and d4 is defended, so white has acually prevented the threat of Qd4 and has a spare pawn, though I think black has enough compensation due to development advantage.} Qd4 12. Qe2 {Better would've been 12.Bxc6 Nxc6 13. Qe2 to get at least some compensation for the bishop.} Qxa4 13. Nc3 {Perhaps 13.e4 would've been better.} Qxc2 14. d4 {White is grabbing the last straw though he is hopelessly lost. The rest of the game is just a question of technique.   In this game Fortune smiled upon me and my opponent made some blunders. When I looked at other of his games, I understood that this was really luck for me because other his games showed reasonable quality. I've had games where I've played even worse.  Anyway, if there were any mistakes or anything some of my readers didn't like, feel free to send your critisism. (make sure it's constructive, not destructive)} Qxe2+ 15. Ngxe2 Bb6 16. O-O O-O 17.
