1. e4 {Most times played in my camp.} e5 {My move directly met.} 2. Bc4 {I've taken a liking to this move vs. Nf3.} Nc6 {seemed standard.} 3. Nc3 {I usually play Nf3 here, but then I thought I would have had  the same effect as if I had played 2. Nf3 then 3. Bc4.} Nf6 {With center pressure and keeping up with development I suppose? Maybe book?} 4. d3 {Strengthening the center and allowing future queen side development......} Bc5 {In most live games which I've played, I or my opponent usually diverts from quality play and attempts unusual even weird/untried moves. This seems not to be the case here!} 5. Be3 {Only know I would not be displeased with trading off for his (good?)Bishop....} Bxe3 {OK} 6. fxe3 {Dreaded doubled pawns? Or perhaps a benefit?} d6 {Seems solid enough, is there perhaps better here?} 7. Qd2 {Trying to put a question in my opponents mind as to which side I may be wanting to castle to.} Ng4 {It just felt like if this was following the book that 7. Qd2 or this Knight move has left us in unmapped territory.} 8. h3 {Danger lurks!} Qh4+ {What in the world did I do to myself this time, I THOUGHT, and thought.............} 9. Kf1 {Guess my opponent forced where my King were to reside.} Qf6+ {Here is the time that a master mind may be needed in explaining why a difference between moving the Queen now or when attacked by my Knight a move later matters?} 10. Nf3 {SEEMS THE SAME TO ME?!} Nh6 {looks awkward.....} 11. Nd5 {His attack, my defence, now my attack, a dream match in live chess!} Qd8 {Just positionally alone I am feeling better....} 12. g4 {This looks crazy because weakening pawn structures near the king is taboo, yet again I was hoping to open that side to the rooks combined power on future open or half open files over there.} Nxg4 {Thought that would happen since the Knight might have needed to go back to the position which he started from(and how embarrassing that would seem).} 13. hxg4 Bxg4 14. Qg2 {figured the next move would be h5.......} Bxf3 {surprise!} 15. Qxf3 O-O {Pawns vs. open lines of attack--a good pawn chain may work!?} 16. Rg1 {Want to begin by pressuring pawns to move in front of that King!} Kh8 {Well, that did not work!} 17. Qh5 {Maybe this will?} Na5 {Back to my plan!} 18. Rh1 h6 {Yessssss...... finally!} 19. Ke2 {Now the rook factor } Nxc4 20. dxc4 {Black did get the better of that.} c6 {Now my attack is in retreat!} 21. Nc3 Qf6 {Got to defend somehow!} 22. Rag1 {Thought this better than Queen chasing.... look how the black Queen is in reverse only kinda.....} Rae8 {Is there better? } 23. Rg2 {Planning to move the King to allow the Knight better activity without an annoying queen check...} Re6 {A sixth rank defence....} 24. Kd2 Rg8 {Not sure here of blacks plan, perhaps pure defence.....} 25. Ne2 {Here comes Mr. Bill's dog!} Rd8 {Yikes!! Feared that file opening....} 26. Ng3 {Spying f5} d5 {My fear is here!} 27. exd5 {Double pawn gone.....} cxd5 {Was really thinking some doom and gloom thought here, then I saw it.....WHEW......} 28. c5 Qg6 {Leading the defence with the Queen works at times....} 29. Qh2 {Preparing a discovered attack when I move my Knight.} e4 {These moments I need a trainer or Master thought....just a bad move???????} 30. Nh5 {We will see???} Qh7 {The Queen's defence!} 31. Nf4 {Trying to work something out} Rf6 32. c3 {Got to quit fearing so much} g5 {An error I believe...weakens the  side some and opens lines} 33. Nh5 {Now for black Re6 maybe} Rf3 {Well, I see that as being the first crack into my lines but black leaves the defense out to lunch.} 34. Qe5+ {Here we go! ENJOY!!!!!} Kg8 35. Rxg5+ hxg5 36. Qxg5+ Qg6 37. Qxd8+ Kh7 38. Nf6+ Kg7 39. Qh8# {Finally an ending worth Gameknot! Please do help this annotation and my yearning for learning.....thekingni......}
