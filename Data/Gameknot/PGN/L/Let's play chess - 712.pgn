1. e4 {standard e4 pawn opening} e5 {blockading and keeping the center deadlocked} 2. f4 {king's gambit!here the position gets crazy and chaotic, instead of doing my usual decline move of Qh4 which is really kind of stupid, I accept the gambit and play by the book at least for now....} exf4 {the executioner in black!} 3. Nf3 {i might of seen this before, it looks pretty solid he's gong for e5 with support} d6 {stopping the advancement ice cold} 4. d4 {subway eat Fresh pawn} Qf6 {protect Fresh pawn and .............that's about it} 5. Bc4 {slice and dice bishop attack} Nc6 {developmental and also probably pretty worthless} 6. O-O {castling strongside, wheels of steel in the making. good tune come to think of it, need to add that to my blog sometime, any way moving on} Nge7 {apaprently not wanting to do Na6 or move the queen I settle for blocading my bishop temporarily, urk..............?} 7. Nc3 {developing the center pawn fortress. And how did I win again..........} Bg4 {pin. nice piece of work to bad there's still Be2 or h3 nullifying it or forcing the exchange possibley} 8. Nb5 {going for Forking station, too bad i've seen that train coming and know I've got another thing coming from the knight of Judas and his faithful priest} Rc8 {protect Calvin, Hobbs} 9. b4 {now I bite my tongue and say what in the world. I guess Nxb4 is followed by Nxa7 so no point really I'll just chase the knight out of house and home sweet home and back to his scarvey motley crue} a6 {on guard walk the plank matey!} 10. e5 {kill the pretty lady with the flower in her hat.........ok,time for some weird counterplay courtesy of Bill's friend. { which I sadly don't know bill}} dxe5 {exchange} 11. dxe5 {looks like i'm a fool for half a second and have attempted and suceeded almost in queened suicide, but there is hope,run away or how about brilliance and take the pawn the knight's pinned afterall...............} Nxe5 {POP goes the weasel. and oh yeah the fun is just beginning!} 12. Qd4 {ooh, how about a lot of fun now, time for the bloodbath and heavy metal thunder!} Nxf3+ {Ride the wind..............Queenie and take a little drop of Poison back to your town.} 13. gxf3 {avoided barbarism of king death} Bh3 {and take that you scarvy dogs!} 14. Rd1 {and now time to play cautious checkmate threat on d7.......} axb5 {actually i lied my friends and that was what he missed, Bishop guarding d7. You call my bluff?} 15. Bf1 {other than saving the bishop, leaving the queen up for auction and trying to bluff me into a quick stupid capture followed by mate { which I almost foolishly took {ah shucks too bad that queen is sitting there hanging by a noose!}This move ulitmately almost accomplishes nothing.} Qxd4+ {Hi, queeen too bad they outlawed gullitines,I was really looking foward that, i guess I'lll have to be satisifed with the simple sword threat to the chest method.} 16. Rxd4 {of course I've got another thing coming from the battery so what can one say??} Bxf1 {time to trade down and savor that advantage of mine} 17. Kxf1 {wow on the replay that looked abrupt.} Ng6 {and why bother?} 18. Bd2 {and yet he's letting my pawn live?} Bd6 {ok if that's how he wants to play it} 19. a4 {trying to get anything now} bxa4 {the exchange} 20. c4 {the oddity?} O-O {Dam*, I totally missed Be5 here!, argh now I'm screaming, of course it probably worked because of Re4+, aw well,goes to show I'm just an itsy bitsy overreactive} 21. Rxa4 {protecting pawn? which is not in danger?} Be5 {now i spot, maybe earlier would of been better?} 22. Re4 {well of course, be my guest and threatening me in ignorance} Rcd8 {counterattack or more like just simple ignorant threat} 23. Ke1 {protector and strong man bruce goodguy.} Rfe8 {setting up fun discoverd pin!} 24. h4 {Drat,it's a crazy ruffian!} Nxh4 {did i mention that pawn was a little out there?} 25. Ke2 {Curses Foiled Again!} Bd6 {AhHa, Magnifico, almost as astounding as TO's stellar play. {Actually i'd say it's slighty better no offense TO}} 26. Rxe8+ {the only logical explanation!} Rxe8+ {Jinkies!} 27. Kf2 {Like Zoinks!} Ng6 {drop back into a defensive scene} 28. Bc3 {Puppy Power!} b6 {anyone want to sacrificea bishop on g7 for a scooby snack?} 29. Bd4 {oh yeah I forgot that bishop's middle name is Scrappy McDon't} c5 {tada, is that all you got you mangy mutt?} 30. bxc5 {no i capture back and stay in game} bxc5 {big chief says no, you no stay in game, I up 6 point} 31. Bb2 {run awAy big river} h5 {Dang we just ran over a Hairy roadkill, thank you we're passed it, that stench was almost unbearable.
