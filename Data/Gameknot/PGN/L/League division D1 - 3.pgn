[Opening "two knights defence (C57), Ulvestad variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Going for the 2 knights opening.} Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 {This move is uncommon. It is a different approach then Na5.} 6. dxc6 {Not the best move. The best was 6.Bf1, followed by black Bg4, 7.f3, Nxd5, 8.Nxf7, Kxf7, and so on.} bxc4 7. O-O Bd6 8. d3 {Not the best either. This move allows me to get rid of my weak, and horrible pawn over a useful pawn. Better was Qe2 or Nc3.} cxd3 9. Qxd3 O-O {Castling to safety. Right now, I thought I had a good game going.} 10. Nc3 a5 {Trying to maybe make a small attack, Ba6.} 11. Nd5 {Well, here is a move that I did not think about much at all.} Nxd5 {Well,"sigh", I failed. I was on a great winning streak right now, and now this......this..move, made me lose it. Dang!!! I won 17 games in a row!! I'm sad.} 12. Qxh7# {Easily punished me, and I deserve it. Thanks for watching this short game.}
