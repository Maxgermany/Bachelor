1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bf4 Nc6 4. h3 Bf5 5. e3 e6 6. g4 Bg6 7. c3 Bxb1 8. Qxb1 {The idea of this move is to place the queen on the white diagonal. But it is questionable.} Bd6 9. Ne5 Ne4 10. Bd3 Nf6 11. Bb5 Bxe5 12. dxe5 Ne4 13. h4 {Necessary in order to play f3. } Qd7 14. f3 Nc5 15. b4 Na6 16. Ba4 Nab8 17. b5 Na5 18. Qb4 {My wsb becomes trapped, but my position is superior. } b6 19. O-O-O {I can even take this risk, since black is cramped. } h6 {Too slow. } 20. e4 c6 21. Qd6 Qxd6 22. exd6 O-O 23. bxc6 Nbxc6 24. exd5 {Black's move here was e5. But, after the piece's exchange, my pawns will decide. } Nd8 25. d7 Nab7 {Better was d6, but I wante to take the full advantage of my two bishops. } 26. Bc6 exd5 27. Bxd5 {Ne6 is not possible because of BxNb7, NxBf4, BxRa8 and black cannot take the bishop because of d8=Q+.} a6 28. Bc7 {The game is won, since the cramp black is in, is mortal.  Nevertheless, it is interesting to see which is the most certain win for white.  A try is g5, threatening to open the column. But after Ne6, the position is really better than after 28. Bd6 or Rh-e1? All seem to be winning, but now, if I get a drawn here, I must shoot myself, so play with care, me baby...} Kh7 29. Rhe1 {Well, of course Bxd8 wins a quality. But chess is a good game for sadistic personalities.} Kg8 30. Re8 Ra7 31. Rde1 Nd6 32. Bxd6 Rxe8 33. dxe8=Q+ {}
