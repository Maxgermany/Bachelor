1. e3 {My opponent used an offbeat opening. } d5 2. d3 e5 3. h3 {He obviously wants me to overattack at some point.} Nf6 4. g3 Bb4+ {Better was Bd6, eyeing weak g3.} 5. Nd2 e4 6. d4 {He got me to the point that I don't know exactly what to play. Bd6 was still the best plan, but I missed it.} Be6 {This unattacking move gets me solidity and I kind of force him to "do something".} 7. Bg2 {Oh, yes, well... so what do I do? } c5 {I knew this meant the end of my dsb.} 8. a3 {I considered Ba5... but I didn't play it. Qa5 doesn't work due to c3.} Bxd2+ 9. Bxd2 Qb6 {Attacking b2, defending c5, and developing. Now I think that cxd4 was better. I open the path for his dsb to become active, though...} 10. dxc5 Qxc5 11. Bb4 Qc7 {...which I did all the same. No problem. } 12. Ne2 a5 13. Bc3 Nbd7 14. Nd4 O-O {I don't care for my lsb, it's almost useless anyway. } 15. Nb5 {So he is attacking, at last...} Qc6 16. a4 {To get rid of this N I have to play Ne8 and Nc7 or d6. But the rest of my position is stone solid, for now. } Rfd8 {I choose this, eyeing a future deploying of my pieces guarding d5, and maybe some d4 advance sooner or later. } 17. Qd2 {Now, the plan Ne8-etc. was still good. Of course, I have to account for Qd4, threatening mate (if I move the N from e8), so f6 was necessary. And of course, his Nd4 is always a threat. My active piece, with good squares, is Nd7, but if I move it, BxNf6 will dislodge my pawns. Then, Qd4, targeting f6... but I can retreat my lsb and have f6 defended by my Q. So, not an easy position. b6, to solidifying my a5 pawn, deprives my N  of a nice square. From b6, I threat Nxa4, followed by QxN... but it doesn't work, due to Nd4. } Nb6 {I played it anyway. Who knows. I also "threat" Nc4. } 18. Nd4 Qd6 {Very carefully, I retreat my Q with f6 in mind.} 19. Nxe6 Qxe6 {I could have played fxN, and if now BxN, gxB, with a supersolid center. But I felt I had to play securely. Now, I'm looking for his Bxa5, followed by my Nc4, winning a piece!} 20. Bd4 Nc4 21. Qc1 Rac8 {A R on the same central semi-opened column can't be bad. } 22. b3 Nd6 {Due to my preventive overprotection of the central pawns, his lsb is not playing at all. } 23. Qb2 {A massive exchange on f6 doesn't scares me. Ne8 and f6 was still a plan, I don't know why I didn't go for it. } Rc6 {Doubling R on the c column can't be bad.} 24. O-O Rdc8 25. c3 {Now his potential threat on g7 is "off".} Nf5 {By exchanging his "good bishop" I can only improve my position. } 26. c4 {With this move, I won a pawn. } Nxd4 27. Qxd4 dxc4 28. bxc4 Rc6xc4 {...and I got a weak b pawn. Still, it can't be bad. The overprotection on e4 gets now very handy.} 29. Qa7 b6 {I have to be careful with back rank threats, but his Q is now blind. } 30. Qa6 h6 {Back rank threats avoided. Maybe g6 was more precise, since his lsb is on the board. } 31. Rfb1 {I thought about Qe5. Rb can't move, because of QxRa1. But I miss a move.} Nd5 {Finally getting my N into play. } 32. Rb5 {I can defend easily with Rc6, but for the first time in the game I wanted to try something. } Nc3 {Too nice not to play it. If I can get rid of his a pawn, the draw is almost certain. } 33. Rxb6 Qe5 {...with a nasty Ne2+ threat. Of course, it leaves my Rc8 undefended, which means I cannot take a4 for the moment. } 34. Qb7 {?? } Ne2+ 35. Kh2 {If Kf1, QxR+, KxN, Rc2#.} Qxa1 {Now, I'd recommend Rb1, with Qxa4 to follow, and Bxe4 (RxB? QxRc8+) and the game can go on. But...} 36. Bxe4 {?? I am not the only one to blunder!} Qg1# {Well, it was my turn to win for a blunder, but still the rest of the game was not played totally badly from my side, so I saved it here anyway. Thanks for reading!}
