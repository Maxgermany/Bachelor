1. e4 {In the words of Bobby Fischer.....e4!  I know that d4 might have been better, but I'm more comfortable with e4.} e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. c3 {Trying to claim control over the d4 square.  I'll make a d4 push on the next move.} d6 5. d4 {Taking control over the center and threatening to demolish all of black's development except for a single pawn.  I think this is the right move.} exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 {Developing and blocking the check.  Two birds, one stone.  Now I'm up in development by a knight and a pawn.} Bxc3+ {Not really sure why he took my knight, but I'm not complaining.} 8. bxc3 {I have traded my b pawn for his e pawn. I think this is good for white.} Na5 {Instead of attacking my bishop, I thought that he should have developed another piece.} 9. Bd3 d5 10. e5 {No need to trade pawns.  Now I have a bind on the dark squares.  This should be good for white.  I will try to use my dark square bishop to dominate him on the dark squares.  I feel that is my most important piece.} f6 11. O-O fxe5 {He really didn't like my pawns I guess.} 12. Nxe5 {Now my knight cannot be challenged by a pawn and it's on a great square.} Nf6 13. Ba3 {To prevent him from castling.  I'm trying to keep his king in the center so I can attack it easier.} Ne4 14. Qf3 {Threatening Qf7 checkmate.} Qf6 15. Bxe4 {I'm up a knight, so if he wants to trade queens, I'm fine with that.} dxe4 16. Qxe4 Be6 17. d5 {This will give me an isolate pawn, but I'm confident in my game.  It shouldn't be too much of a weakness.} O-O-O 18. dxe6 Qxe6 19. Qg4 {I'm still up a piece, so I want as many of his pieces off the board as I can get.} Qxg4 20. Nxg4 Nc4 21. Bb4 h5 22. Ne3 {Again this will give me another isolated pawn.} Nd2 23. Rfd1 g5 24. Be7 Rd7 25. Bxg5 Rg8 26. h4 Ne4 27. Rxd7 Kxd7 28. Rd1+ {28 moves into the game and I've finally developed my last piece.} Kc8 29. Nf5 Rf8 30. Ne7+ Kb8 31. Rd3 a6 32. Be3 b6 33. Nc6+ Kb7 34. Nd8+ Kc8 35. Ne6 Re8 36. Ng7 Rd8 37. Rxd8+ {I saw here that the trade of rooks would be good for white.  After I take his h pawn, white will be up a piece and a pawn.  As long as I don't screw up too bad, white should win with this position.} Kxd8 38. Nxh5 Nxc3 39. a3 a5 40. Nf4 Ne4 41. h5 Nf6 42. h6 Nh7 {That is where his knight stays for most of the endgame.} 43. Ne6+ Kd7 44. Nd4 c5 45. Nb5 Ke6 46. g4 Kf6 47. Bf4 a4 48. Bc7 c4 49. Bxb6 Kg5 50. Be3+ Kxg4 51. Kg2 {I know that I should have brought my king out earlier, but I saw that he couldn't do anything about my pieces chasing him around the board while I pick up his pawns.} Kf5 52. Nd6+ Ke5 53. Nxc4+ Kd5 54. Nb6+ Kc6 55. Nxa4 Kb5 56. Nc3+ Kc4 57. a4 {Black can't take the knight, otherwise the pawn would queen and he couldn't stop it.} Kb4 58. Bd2 {Now that the queenside is all protected, I'll move my king towards his knight to queen my h pawn.} Ka5 59. Kf3 Nf6 60. Kf4 Nh7 61. Kf5 Ka6 62. Kg6 Nf8+ 63. Kg7 Ne6+ 64. Kg8 {Game over, but we continued playing.} Nd4 65. h7 Nf3 66. h8=Q Nxd2 67. Qe5 Nb3 68. Qb5+ Ka7 69. Nd5 {I didn't want to take his knight, so I could mess up and let him leave with a stalemate.  I want the win.  Don't we all?} Nd4 70. Qb6+ {Mate in one.} Ka8 71. Nc7# {1-0.  I know that at first my aim was around my dark square bishop and dominating the dark squares, but mid-way through my plan changed.  I saw that I could win most of his pieces and have a good endgame for white so I took that option.  Again, this is my first attempt at annotating so feedback would be appreciated, both good and bad.}
