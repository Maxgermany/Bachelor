[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Eric decides to play the Scandinavian Defense.} 2. Ne2 {? But, this is a mistake, Erika.  The most common response to the Scandinavian Defense is 2.exd5 which is then followed up with 2...Qxd5 (to avoid losing a pawn), 3.Nc3 with a slight advantage for white since black's is a little behind in development and has his Queen harrassed.  But, this should lose a pawn.} Bg4 {This does develop, but best was 2...dxe4, winning a pawn, at once.  As now, you can and will defend the pawn and in a good way since his Bg4 will be under siege.} 3. f3 e5 {?? I presume that Eric was planning to develop his Bf8, but this is a blunder that will cost him a piece for a pawn.  I'm not exactly sure what black's must move was, but much better, however, was for Eric to retreat his Bg4.} 4. fxg4 dxe4 5. d3 {Keeping in mind that Eric is not going to get another pawn, this move was played to allow Erika to develop her Bc1.} Nf6 {In the meantime, Eric starts with his development.} 6. Nbc3 {? Likewise, Erika continues with her development.   But, better was 6.g5, as now, Eric can win a pawn.} Nc6 {I'm not calling this inaccuracy, like I would, if it was a 1.d4 d5 opening.  And, I know why Eric made this move, but I, however, would've advanced the c pawn or played 6...Nbd2.  The reason being is because even though Erika's first move was 1.e4, black's first move was 1...d5 since it started off with the Scandinavian Defense.  Since that happened, I'm saying the same thing that I'd say in 1.d4 d5 openings.  I Eric's c pawn to be very important and like a center pawn.  But, this move, however, blocks the c pawn.  So, I would've waited until advancing the c pawn, before playing ...Nc6.  However, I would've played 6...Nxg4 to win that pawn, at once.} 7. Be3 {Meanwhile, Erika continues developing.  This time, it's in a more accurate way.  But, as noted, best was still 7.g5 since that pawn is still attacked. } Bb4 {Meanwhile, Eric answers with a pin which can be broken.  But, he is still forgetting about the g pawn.} 8. a3 {Breaking the pin in an aggressive.  8.Bd2 also works, and that's generally how I break this kind of pin since Coach Stockel told me that this is the way to do it.  However, I like this answer better as it should prevent Erika from losing a pawn right away.} Nxg4 {?? As this is another blunder from Eric.  What's more is that timing is everything, as this would've been good a move or two ago.  But, this move, however, allows white to win a piece for two pawns, in return.  } 9. h3 {I would've played 9.axb4 right away.  But, I like this just as well since it leads to the same thing.} O-O {?? King safety was on Eric's mind.  But, this is a blunder that should now lose a piece without anything in return.  In this position, find white's best move, Erika.} 10. axb4 {?? And, the solution was 10.hxg4.  You probably didn't want doubled pawns on the g file, Erika since I got into the .5 point issue where doubled pawns are 0.5 less then two seperate pawns.  But, that doesn't make a difference here as you'd get a piece in return which is worth much more.  With this move, however, white will get back a piece which will leave you the equivalent of only a pawn up.} Nxe3 11. Nxe4 {?? It looks like white has gotten a pawn back.  But, this is a terrible blunder that should lose, Erika, because Eric will win the Queen for a Knight, in return.  So, as Ken posted in one of your more recent annotations, it's not worth this exchange.} Nxd1 12. Kxd1 a5 {Opening up a file for his Rook.} 13. Rxa5 {?? Erika played this because it appeared to win black a pawn.  But, this is another blunder, Erika, as it gives away a Rook for a Knight and Pawn.  This doesn't seem to make a big difference, but being behind already, the last thing you want to liquidate like this.  So, Better was 13.bxa5, undoubling, reconnecting, your pawns.} Nxb4 14. Rxe5 Ra1+ {Eric dishes in the check.} 15. Kd2 {I would've interposed with 15.Nc1 to allow white to castle after bringing the Bf1 into play.} Ra7 {I don't know why Eric retreated his Rook since it was not attacked.  In addition, Erika's Bf1 would've remained pinned, for moving it would lose her Rh1.} 16. c3 {But, this however, is what I also would've played.  The idea is that when behind like this and are not doing well, as archduke_piccolo put it, "Play the man, not the board."} f6 {But, Eric responds by counterattacking.} 17. Rb5 c6 {?? And, he goes on the attack again.  But, this is a blunder, as Erika will win back a piece and equalize the game.} 18. Rxb4 g6 {I don't know why Eric played this, but my guess is that he's getting his King ready for action since we're nearing the endgame.} 19. b3 {Going for a pawn wall, pawn chain.  The idea is that I've taught her that they're pretty good during the endgames.  But, I would've attacked the b7 pawn with 19.Nc5 to add pressure against black's Queen Side.  } Ra2+ {Similar to Erika, I guess that Eric just enjoys placing his opponents in check.} 20. Ke3 f5 {Eric goes after the Knight.  I actually like it since it prevents black from winning a pawn.} 21. Rxb7 {?? But, Erika ignores that and takes which is a mistake as Eric will win the Knight, in return.  Best was 21.N4g3.} fxe4 22. dxe4 Rxe2+ {?? But, this was also a blunder, and just about anything else was better then this move.  As Erika will get the Rook, in return which will leave her the equivalent to a pawn up.} 23. Kxe2 c5 {I'm not sure why Eric played this.  But, I believe that his intention was to exchange his c pawn.} 24. c4 {And, Erika stops that pawn from advancing.  But, it's irrelevant, at this point, because Eric timed out here.  Despite that, the important lesson for both you and Eric to learn is to not take a pawn or minor piece when it's protected by something like a major piece, as kenneth_fiore_3 pointed out in one of your recent annotations, Erika.  As you don't want to give up something that's worth more.}
