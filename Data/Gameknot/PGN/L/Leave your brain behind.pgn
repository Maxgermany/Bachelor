[Opening "Sicilian (B32), Flohr variation"]

1. e4 c5 {The frightening sicilian.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 {Sicilian (B32), Flohr variation} 4. Nxd4 e6 {Black transposes into the Taimanov line, but most probably his main reason for this move is to free his bishop for an attack. On gameknot the line is still called Sicilian (B32), Flohr variation.} 5. Bb5 {White doesn't know that line, so he makes an automatic move thinking that he seriously pins the knight. The Taimanov line continues with 5. Nxc6.} Qb6 {Black believes in his queen's power, and loves to mobilize her early.} 6. O-O {Here white completely neglects the position, and makes another automatic move without consideration to the threats. The knight on d4 is extremely weak, and does more harm than good in this position. The bishop on b5 would probably serve better if he exchanged at c6.} g6 {Black opts for an unjustified fianchetto, and gives back time to  white.} 7. Nc3 {White keeps neglecting the essence of the position, and hopes that this will protect his bishop or he simply wants to develop another piece. Now his knight on d4 is hopelessly hanged.} Bc5 {Fortunately black is equally in haste, so he rushes away and misses the free capture of White's knight.} 8. Be3 {White misses the given and time-winning fork on a4, and invites to battle for the dominance of d4.} Bxd4 9. Bxc6 {Confusing move, and that's probably the scope here. White wants to break Black's psychological dominance, and make him stop and wonder.} Bxe3 10. Na4 {Another lame attack, and without positional care.} Qxc6 {Now black feels like a King on the board, and he is completely sure of winning this game. Who wouldn't, given this hopeless situation for white ?} 11. fxe3 {White keeps fighting, knowing that blitz-games can turn around quickly.} Qxa4 12. b3 {Better would have been to defend with Qd3.} Qxe4 {Black feels like a Grandmaster now, and white is definitely losing here. But white knows that black is a rookie like himself, so he keeps hoping for mistakes on black's behalf.} 13. Re1 Nf6 14. Qd4 {What about the poor guy on c2 ?} d6 {Black doesn't care about pawns either, so what's next ?} 15. Qxd6 {White is too kind, and lets the hung knight on f6 live. He can't afford to miss material gaining opportunities like this.} Bd7 16. Rad1 {At this point anything for white is losing, so he might as well start to swindle. } Qxc2 {Black is eager to win, and he seizes the 7th rank (from black's point of view) faster than thinking.} 17. Rd2 {Way too lame. White needs to look for tactical opportunities in order to turn things around, and black has a knight on f6 that could easily be pinned.} Qc3 18. Qd4 {Is it good for white to exchange queens when he's down on material ??} Qxd4 19. Rxd4 Rc8 20. Red1 {We must remember this game was played OTB face to face, and perhaps white has a psychological reason for pretending that he's got a remedy. It certainly looks confident to deploy a battery when losing is so apparent.} O-O 21. h3 e5 22. Rd4d6 Rcb8 {Aha...black starts to lose concentration. At least some material gain for white is ahead.} 23. Rxf6 {Keep pretending that you can win even when losing, and the opponent might fall for it.} Rfc8 {Fantastic ! White's stubbornness starts to yield some benefits, and now black's bishop has to say goodbye. So has the winning game for black, and now there's hope for white.} 24. Rxd7 Kh8 {Unbelievable, but given the time-pressure it can be understood that black is nervous. He's probably regretting his recent mistakes, and he fails to stay concentrated.} 25. Rfxf7 Rc1+ 26. Kh2 Kg8 27. Rfxh7 Re8 28. Rdxb7 {If black has lost his confidence, white on the other hand starts to realize his opportunities for a win. With less pieces on the board, it is so much easier to play cleverly under time-pressure. But we have seen that both players make gross blunders, so what says that white won't make any more bad moves ?- Nothing !} Rb8 {Another nervous move from black, and Re1 attacking white's pawn would have been much better.} 29. Rbxa7 Ra1 30. Kg3 {White starts to centralize his king, knowing that his pawns on the queen-side serve as good deflecting bates. Perhaps black will be so greedy, that he starts aiming at them. If so, white can concentrate on Black's king and look for a kill.} Rxb3 {Hmmm...white's previous swindles really start to pay off. Black is deflected from the defence of his king and this may be costly.} 31. Kf3 {Better would have been to capture Black's rook at b3.Then if black recaptures at a7, white could eliminate black's last rook. } Rf1+ 32. Ke4 Rb4+ 33. Kxe5 Rf5+ 34. Ke6 Re4+ 35. Kd6 Rf6+ 36. Kd5 Re5+ {What happened to the dominating black we saw in the first half of the game ?? When playing over the board face to face, it is very important to stay cool and keep one's concentration unaffected by the opponent. (easy to say, but we all know how hard it is). } 37. Kxe5 {Obvious !} Rf2 {Black hates to lose just as much as white does, and he is not the resigning kind. He seems to be thinking: " Come on and mate me if you can. I'm not dead yet".} 38. Rhg7+ Kf8 39. Ke6 {Closing in for a kill.} Rf5 40. Rxg6 Re5+ 41. Kxe5 {Black keeps hoping for a stalemate. Invane though !} Ke8 42. Rg8# {Handshaking, and time for both players to think things over.}
