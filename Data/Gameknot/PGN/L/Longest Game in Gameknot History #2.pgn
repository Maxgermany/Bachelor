1. e4 {This is going to be the longest game ever played at gameknot.com.  Keep an eye on it! (:  I opened with the traditional e4. } c5 {Over a month later, use the pawn responded with c5 which is the start of the english opening.} 2. Nf3 {I followed this up with knight to f3.  Right after this I started student teaching and became really busy....only 1 move occurred between January 2008 and May 2008!} d6 {On May 24th, 2008, usethepawn finally made the next move which looked to be possibly a start of an attack on the queen side.} 3. c3 {I followed up with c3 on June 19, 2008.  This way I could force d4 on my next move.} Nf6 4. Qc2 Nc6 {October 15th, 2008.}
