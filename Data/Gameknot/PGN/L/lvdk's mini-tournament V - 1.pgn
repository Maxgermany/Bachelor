1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d3 Nd4 {Try and complete your development before you begin an attack. Bg5 pinning the knight is a good idea too.} 5. Nxd4 exd4 6. Ne2 Bd6 {?? don't drop a pawn unless it is clear that you will get a winning advantage. You can try Bf5 or F5 as good alternatives.} 7. Nxd4 O-O {A very good move that tucks the king away to a safer location.} 8. g3 c5 9. Nf3 b5 {Maybe too aggressive. Remember to complete your development before you attack. That way you have a better chance to succeed. Some good moves are ...Qc7; ...Re8.  } 10. e5 Bxe5 11. Nxe5 Qe7 {A strong pin!} 12. f4 {A} Bb7 {Very nice move} 13. Rg1 d6 14. Qe2 dxe5 15. Bd2 Rad8 {Prehaps ...Rfe8 to put more pressure on the e2 square} 16. O-O-O b4 17. b3 Nd5 18. f5 Qf6 {?? playing the simple f6 would have given you a very good position. } 19. g4 e4 20. Kb1 Ba6 21. Qe1 exd3 22. Bxd3 Bxd3 23. cxd3 Rfe8 24. Qf2 Nc3+ 25. Bxc3 Qxc3 {very nice sequence of moves you are defiantly winning here} 26. Qc2 {?? not the right time. There is a simple mathematically equation for calulating for when your can capture a piece safely. Just simple count how many pieces your opponent has guarding the capture piece and then count how many pieces you have attacking the piece.  If the number you have attacking the piece is greater than the number defending the piece then it is safe to take it.   In this position by using the above formula you can see that it is not safe to take the pawn. White has 2 defenders vs your 2 attackers. So if you want to take the pawn you have to add another piece to attack it. For example, ...Re3 would a good idea. } Rxd3 { } 27. Rxd3 Re1+ 28. Rxe1 Qxe1+ 29. Kb2 Qe5+ 30. Kb1 Qe1+ 31. Rd1 {}
