[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B05), modern, Flohr variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 {The Alekhine Defense is my usual reply to e4 vs. good players.  It avoids a lot of theory, and it's easy for black to find useful plans in the middle-game} 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3 {Entering the so-called "Modern variation."  } Bg4 {Black's other continuation is 4...g6 followed by ...Bg7. In both cases, black's plan is to blockade the white pawn center, and snipe away at it from the flanks. } 5. Be2 e6 6. O-O Be7 7. c4 Nb6 8. Nc3 {An often-seen line is the exchange variation, 8.exd6 cxd6, which I believe is better for black than the more usual 8.Nc3 seen in this game} O-O 9. Be3 d5 10. c5 Bxf3 {This is pretty much forced. After 10... Nc4 11.Bxc4 dxc4 12.Qe2 Bxf3 13.gxf3 white is winning, and similarly after 10 ... N6d7 11.Rc1 intending to push to b & c pawns to b5 & c6 (and if 11... b6 12.c6 Nxc6 13.Nxd5!)} 11. gxf3 {Karpov's move, with the idea to play 12.f4!  supporting the center.} Nc8 12. b4 {Not as good as 12.f4, IMO, as it allows black's next move.} Bh4 {If white had played 12.f4, then after this move, the continuation 13.Bd3 g6 14.Qg4 puts black in a bind, since the N on c8 has no move (...Ne7? loses the Bishop)} 13. Kh1 Ne7 14. Rg1 f6 {Sniping away at the pawn center.} 15. f4 {Too late, the horse has already left the barn!} fxe5 16. fxe5 g6 {Now black's N has a nice outpost on f5.} 17. Rg2 Nf5 18. Bd3 Kh8 {Intending to recapture with the g pawn if white plays Bxf5.} 19. b5 a6 20. a4 axb5 21. axb5 Nd7 {Finally developing the other N!} 22. Ne2 Rxa1 23. Qxa1 Qa8 {Grabbing the a-file.} 24. Qb2 {If 24.Qxa1 Rxa1 and black's rook will infiltrate into white's camp.} Nxe3 {Opening up the f-file, and looking to exploit the f2 square.} 25. fxe3 Qe8 {The threat is ...Qf7 followed by ...Qf1+} 26. Nf4 g5 27. Nh3 h6 28. Ng1 Qf7 29. e4 Ra8 {The position is roughly equal. Black's N will go to e6 (after the eventual pawn exchange) where it will blockade the white e-pawn, and black will start putting pressure on d4, which white will not be able to hold as his B is on the wrong color squares. In return, black's king is a bit exposed and the k-side light squares are weak.} 30. exd5 exd5 31. Qe2 Nf8 32. Nf3 Ra1+ 33. Rg1 Ra2 {Trying to unbalance the position by trading R + P for the two minor pieces. This will reduce white's ability to operate against the weak light squares, and eliminates an important defender of d4.} 34. Nxg5 {Playing into black's plan.  White is lost after this, as he will not be able to defend his d pawn.  Instead, white should play 34.e6 Rxe2 35.exf7 Re3 36.Nxh4 Rxd3 37.Nf5, and both sides still have chances.} hxg5 {I want to keep control of the f2 + e1 squares.} 35. Qxa2 Qf3+ 36. Qg2 Qxd3 37. Qg4 Kg7 {The king is on his way to f7/e7, where it can support the Ne6.} 38. b6 cxb6 39. cxb6 Kf7 40. Rd1 Qe4+ {The winning move!  To be fair, this move could probably have been played earlier with similar effect, but my plan had been to win the weak d pawn, so I didn't even consider it until I was forced to move my Q by Rd1.  White obviously didn't see it, either. } 41. Qxe4 {Or 41.Qg2 Ng6 intending ...Nf4, and white has to capture on e4 anyway.} dxe4 {Black will be able to blockade the white pawns, but the black e pawn is unstoppable. } 42. Kg2 Ne6 43. Kf1 Nf4 {Black controls all the squares in front of the passed pawn. White will have to give up his R to stop it.} 44. Rc1 e3 45. Rc2 Ke6 {There's no rush to play e2. The threat is worth more than the move itself.  White resigns here, but black will next move Kd5 and pick up the two center pawns before finally playing e2.  White will give up his rook for the N + P, and black will have an easy win after taking the pawn on b6.}
