1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 4. d4 {Following along main lines. } d5 {d5?! This move gains center space but after c5 black's knight is forced to c4 where it is dying to get trapped , or d7 when after nc3 , c6 black has a very hard time activating his pieces. } 5. c5 Nc4 {Black decides to , essentially, sacrifice a piece as he wastes a lot of time getting his knight back to c6.} 6. Nf3 Bg4 {Pinning the knight but it just gives up the two Bishops after h3, better is Bf5.} 7. b3 {Forcing the knight to a5.} Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Nc6 {Black decided to sacrifice his c4 knight because after Na5 white gets the superior game because of white's extra space and black's hard development. } 9. bxc4 Nxd4 10. Qc3 Nf5 {Better would be dxc5 but the sacrifice is already wearing off. } 11. cxd5 Qxd5 12. Bb2 Qe4+ 13. Be2 Qxg2 14. Qf3 {Now black is almost forced to trade queens as after Qg5 Qxb7 white is clearly better. Though white could of played Bf3 and won the b7 pawn I played Qf3 because I was up material.} Qxf3 15. Bxf3 O-O-O 16. Nd2 e6 17. Ne4 Nh4 18. Ke2 f5 {f5?! this creates a big weakness on e6 after Ng5 not to mention the fork threat of Nf7.} 19. Ng5 Rd7 20. Nxe6 Ng6 {Black moves back his knight. Better was Nxf3 Kxf3 Rd2 when black get's rooks on the seventh.} 21. Rad1 Rxd1 22. Rxd1 {Now white is in control and black has the awkward development. } Be7 23. Nxg7 {White wins another pawn .} f4 24. c6 {I try to break up the queenside and introduce mating threats of Rd8 later in the game but another idea is e6 threatening N discoveries and Rd7.} bxc6 {Black should play b6 as this wrecks his queenside and activates my bishop.} 25. Bxc6 Rg8 26. Nf5 Rd8 {This loses the exchange by force and the game as black will be down heavily by material. } 27. Nxe7+ {Removing the defender of the d8 rook. } Nxe7 28. Bb7+ {! And decoying the king away . The sacrifice must be accepted as Kb8 Rxd8 and white wins a tempo from the line played. } Kxb7 29. Rxd8 h6 {Better would probably be to activate his knight but black's doomed. } 30. Rd7 Nf5 31. e6 Kc8 32. Bf6 h5 33. Rd8+ Kb7 34. e7 Nxe7 {Forced to stop queening.} 35. Bxe7 c6 36. Rf8 Kc7 37. Rxf4 Kd7 38. Re4 Kc7 39. Bc5 {With this move white plans to play Re7  and then bring his king over to checkmate , which can't be stopped. } a6 40. Re7+ Kd8 41. Kd3 a5 42. Kd4 a4 43. Ke5 a3 44. Kd6 {Black resigns as h4, Bb6 , Kc8, Kxc6  there is no defense to the mate on e8.}
