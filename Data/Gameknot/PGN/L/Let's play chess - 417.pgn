[Opening "KGA (C33), bishop's gambit, Chigorin's attack"]

1. e4 {White challenged the center with a king's gambit, but then he went to attack only with one piece at a time, without any support, and eventually got himself in trouble, allowing me to build a strong supported passed pawn, then because white had less space and lacked coordination of his pieces, I was able to sacrifice a couple of pawns and a bishop to force the promotion, and won the game} e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 Qh4+ 4. Kf1 d6 5. Nc3 Be6 {inviting white to exchange so I can undouble my f pawns and eliminate one of white's developed piece, then if Nf3 probably Qf6 or Qe7 will be my reply    } 6. Qe2 c6 7. d4 {Bxc4... or Nd7 is the natural sequence removes white best developed piece and develops} Bxc4 8. Qxc4 Nd7 {and now as planed Nd7 to develop and create the chance for a long castle} 9. Nf3 Qf6 10. h4 g6 {to get my bishop to h6 adding another defender to f4} 11. Rh3 {?! I have some doubts about this white move, what does he aim for with Rh3?} Bh6 {as planed} 12. e5 {now white will double his pawns opening a central column in front of my king, so I need to castle soon, but at the some time leaves me with another attack objective} Qf5 {forced} 13. exd6 Ngf6 {now I complete my development and am ready to castle} 14. Ng5 O-O {the choice was made by white's Ng5 this is the best way to defend f7 while putting my king to safety } 15. Qd3 Qxd3+ {I'm very happy with this queen exchange... after this I can occupy the open column or play Nh5 with the idea of further defend my f4 pawn, and prepare f6 either way Nh5 and Rfe8 will occur soon, white has several weak pawns that now became easy targets to my pieces} 16. Rxd3 {I expected this move, the alternative cxd3? was just dumb, with tripled pawns on the d column white achieves nothing strategically speaking } Nh5 {next I need to put my rook on the d open column avoiding white's Ne6 while releasing f8 for my bishop, if given the chance to play f6 with tempo I can start thinking on undouble my f pawns f6-g5 if white captures g5 I have fxg5 and I have a great mobile pawn majority on the king side} 17. Bd2 {Now Im going to occupy the open e column, and leave f8 to my bishop} Rfe8 {now white has to get his g5 knight back in the center of the board, as I'm threatening to play f6...} 18. Nge4 {headed to c5, I can play b6 to prevent it or continue as planed and play Bf8, } Bf8 {more pressure on d6 that is about to fall, and now I expect white to play Nc5 the aim of his previous Ne4 move... I need to prevent Nxc5 dxc5 were with would get a great protected passed pawn on d6 but also I can't leave my knight on d7 while I play Bxd6 so I need to move the knight before any definition on how to remove d6 I should maybe sacrifice the b pawn with either Ndf6 or Nb6 also to prevent the c knight to came to defend the c5 knight} 19. Nc5 {and now white has created a couple of options to play next either Nca4 or Nce4 consolidating the c5 position} Ndf6 {now preventing both Nxd7 and Nce4, plus adding one more defender to d5, now white has two options to capture b7 or to push the d6 pawn, after any Red8 solves my problems and threatens both d pawns, I may need to relocate my bishop on g7 to exert more pressure over d4, also luring d7 and sacrificing the b8 pawn to open another column to my rooks} 20. d7 Red8 {forced as Re7 would block the f8 bishop, now white is almost forced to accept the b7 pawn sacrifice} 21. Nxb7 Rxd7 {forced} 22. Na5 {I was expecting Nc5, this places the knight at the rim, although attacks the c pawn, I've intend to push it, so I'll be fine... from now on I need to be careful and don't allow white to coordinate his pieces, my king position is better, and it is not exposed, but my pawns are weaker, so I need to give white some weaknesses of his own to balance the endgame} c5 23. Ne2 {...dxc5 would have opened the a7-g1 diagonal for my bishop} cxd4 {and now I expect white to capture one of my pawns... maybe d4 as leaves f4 still "under fire" from the d2 bishop... } 24. Nc4 {...surprised me... but allows some complications in the game...} Rc8 {pinning the c3 knight} 25. b3 {only, as any other would lose the c pawn, the alternative Ne5 to move the knight to f3 to block my f pawn and attack d3 looks otherwise interesting} Nd5 {headed to e3} 26. Rd1 {only move, either Nxd4 and Rxd4 are losing... } Bc5 {adding a further defender to e3 were the action is set to happen...} 27. Kf2 {and white does just that also..., but his king is now in my bishop's diagonal} Ne3 {at the some time attacks the d1 rook and discovers a defender to d4} 28. Bxe3 {forced} fxe3+ {great, finally I get to undouble my f pawns and create a supported passed pawn in the process, I am clearly better, I have one supported passed pawn and white pieces are severely restricted and uncoordinated, now I shall push the king's wing pawns to support my central pawns or even to create more passed pawns to divide white's defenders} 29. Kf1 Re7 {inviting white to exchange on d4, while supporting the e2 push if white does exchange} 30. g3 {? I might try to sacrifice my knight and push the f pawn with tempo} f5 {now threatens to storm white's king side with my pawns... h6-g5-hxg5-f4-gxf4 might follow depending on white's reaction to this, other option I'm considering is to sacrifice my knight on g3, in order to push the f pawn with tempo} 31. Kg2 {! prevents both my ideas... so I now think I need Rf8 to support the pawn push} Rf8 {supports further advance of the f pawn} 32. Kf3 f4 {to open some lines or to support the e pawn, it all depends on white's reply} 33. g4 {so it's the added support to the e3 pawn, and not the opening of lines on the white king} Ng3 {forced} 34. Nxd4 h5 {I'll sacrifice a pawn to remove the defender from f5, to get my knight another square to maneuver} 35. Nc6 {I expected gxh5 or g5 but this allows also the same inherent idea} hxg4+ {a zwischenzug that leaves the e7 rook "en prise" for one move, only after Kxg4 I have Re6 to safeguard the rook, with this move I removed white's defense of f5 the primary objective of 34...h5} 36. Kxg4 Re6 {and now I remove my rook from danger and have f5 free for my knight} 37. Nd8 {? achieves nothing, N6e5 was better as it blocks the e column, the played move just wastes time} Ree8 {and next I have e2... one step closer to promotion, now I expect Nb7 to continue with the harassment strategy, but then I'll sacrifice my bishop to push e2, and if Nxc5 I have f3 and white can only stop the promotion if he sacrifices material, I expect my opponent to resign soon} 38. Nb7 {as expected, keeping a coherent harassment strategy...} e2 {I'll sacrifice the bishop to get my promotion going... so next Nxc5 f3!! and white doesn't have Rxf3 due to exd1=Q that pins the f3 rook to win it next if Kxg3 I have f2!} 39. Rb1 {? what is the point?} Bf2 {natural reply and promotion next move} 40. Nbd6 {? achieves nothing, because now e1=Q and if:  a) Nxe8 then Qxb1 -+ b) Rxe1 then Rxe1 -+  and I have an huge advantage either way...} e1=Q 41. Rxe1 Rxe1 42. Kf3 Bg1 {the idea is to keep control over e3 and play next Re3+ and if white exchanges or tries to gain a quality on e3 to give discovered check fxe3 with another promotion to follow soon after} 43. Kg4 {?! what is the point? Kf3-Kg4-Kf3-Kg4... and we are playing cat and mouse now...} Bc5 {to exchange B by N if I have the chance} 44. Nd2 Bxd6 {one exchange one less piece for white to bother me with} 45. Rxd6 Rd1 {pins the knight and next I plan for Ne4, if white keeps his rook on the d column} 46. Rd3 {?} Rxd2 {another exchange and another piece less to bother with, now if Rxd2 I have Ne4 and promotion is assured, unless white sacrifices his rook} 47. Rxd2 {? and promotion of the f pawn is near} Ne4 {defending against Rf3 and preparing Nd2 to attack the promotion square f1} 48. Rd3 {?? any way f3 would follow if white played any other} Nf2+ {a simple fork...}
