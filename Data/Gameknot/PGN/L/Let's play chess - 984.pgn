1. Nf3 {My main white opening OTB and in correspondence and one in which I have a very good score. I rarely lose with it so this game is memorable in many ways!} Nf6 2. d4 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 d6 5. e4 O-O 6. Be2 {6..c5 7.O-O cd4 is the Sicilian Maroczy Bind which is how I play against 6. Be2} e5 7. O-O Na6 {Oddly I have never faced this, despite being a 1.Nf3 / 1. d4 player OTB and in correspondence for some time. I have also played 7...ed4 myself and it's good fun.  I react rather badly to an unfamiliar situation...} 8. h3 {?! Aimed at blocking the light-squared bishop. 8. Re1 or 8. Be3 are more regular, but I do not study theory, preferring tactics and endgame technique as being ultimately more rewarding.} exd4 9. Nxd4 Nc5 {With pressure on e4, the point of the ...Na6 manouvre.} 10. f3 {?? 10.Qf3 is the least worst option. The move played weakens g3 and f4 way too much. I wanted a Maroczy position-type which I have handled with the Black pieces to good effect.} Nh5 {Eyeing f4 and g3 and opening the file for the King. White is now losing according to Fritz 8.} 11. b4 {Trying to gain Maroczy-style counterplay on the queen-side and in the centre. It backfires badly although there is an attack coming on my king.} Ne6 12. Nxe6 Bxe6 13. Bb2 {?? This is just suicide although my position sucks.} Qg5 {White's king will face armageddon or white will drop a piece. It takes something to lose with white this quickly}
