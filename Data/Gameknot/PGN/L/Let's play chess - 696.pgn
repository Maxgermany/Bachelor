1. d4 {1. d4   e6 - going to try the stonewall defense went with e6 first in case white replies with e4 } e6 2. e3 f5 3. Nf3 d5 4. Bb5+ {4. Bb5+  c6 - White's Bb5 surprised me a little.  I had planned to play c6 anyway to reinforce the d5 pawn.} c6 5. Bd3 Nf6 {5. Nf6 will strengthen my claim on e4  } 6. Bd2 {White's Bd2 means I don't have to worry too much a exchange involving the black square bishop.   Suppose he could do a3 followed by Bb4.  Plan is to back the Bishop up with Queen, especially if I see a3 on move 7.  I prefer to castle on move 7 } Bd6 {Continuing with Stonewall development.  Plan is to castle next unless there is a threat to the Bishop} 7. Qe2 O-O {Is White thinking of some kind of Kingside attack - Ng5 followed by Qf3 then Qh3.  I have got to keep the N on f6 as it guards the h pawn.  Looking ahead, I could begin the process of moving the white square bishop over - Bd7, Be8, Bg6.  If on move 8, White does Ng5, I am ruling out h6 - at least for now.} 8. c4 {I am not too worried about White capturing d5 as I would just recapture. However, advancing to c5 would cause me to retreat the Bishop to either e7 or c7, neither of which appeal to me.  b6 will prevent the c5 advance, at least for now.} b6 9. b3 Bd7 {Starting the zig-zag - I am a little worried about Ne5, plan is Be8, then Nd7 Also considering Ne4, but in a closed game, Knights are better than Bishops and I think that could lead to Knight for a Bishop exchange.  On the plus, White would be forced to move the Knight on f3.  It also open up the F file for the rook.} 10. a3 {Looks like White is going to attack Queenside.  I remember losing one game because I allowed White to push pawns far down Queenside.  I think a5 would stop the attack.  If he pushes the pawn to b4, then my reply is axb4.  If he takes with a pawn, then I get the Rook.  If he captures with Bishop, I will reluctanly take the bishop Bxb4+.  If he retakes with the pawn, then I get the Rook.  If he blocks the check with Knight - Nd2, then my best course is to retreat the Bishop to a5, keeping the white Knight pinned for now.  Bc3 attacking the Rook can be easily defeated by moving the Rook. When I look closer, Bc3 could force a Rook move, allowing Rxa3, guarding the Bishop.} a5 11. Nc3 {Think we are done with the opening.  White has developed all his pieces but hasn't castled yet.  I still have a Knight that hasn't moved yet.  King is relatively safe.  Going to push the c pawn.  Considered Be8 but it seems passive.  } c5 12. Nb5 {Interesting.  In a closed game, I don't mind trading a bishop for a knight, especially a light square bishop that is usually problematic in the Stonewall.  Bxb5 will also allow me to develop my queenside knight to d7.} Bxb5 13. cxb5 Nbd7 14. a4 Rc8 {Think the c file will come open so let's position the rook to hold it.} 15. O-O {Up till now I have had a good idea what to do next.  cxd4 will just be a pawn exchange.  I will also have to defend the e6 pawn after white recaptures (persumely with e3 pawn).  cxd4 also opens a black square so the bishop has a little more room.  How would I defend the e6 pawn?  Re8, Qe8, or Ne4?  I am also thinking that if White moves the Knight, the Ng4 allows a threat to White's h pawn.} cxd4 {In hindsight, this might not had been a good move} 16. Nxd4 Qe8 {so much for my thinking - white recaptured with the Knight.  e6 would be a good forking square for the White Knight.  Be5 looks interesting for the next move.  At some point I should also consider Ne4.  With no pawn on d4, I can also consider Ne5} 17. Rac1 Rxc1 {I have to do the Rook swap} 18. Rxc1 Ne4 {Still may be a swap but let's do Ne4 now} 19. f3 Nxd2 {Knight for a Bishop - just though it would be the white square bishop} 20. Qxd2 {Thinking Rf6 to guard the e pawn.  Will allow me to move the Queen so that I can get a king side attack going.  Ne5 was also appealing but feel that I would be force to move the knight after f4.  } Rf6 21. f4 Qh5 22. g3 Nc5 {Depending what White does, I could either go e4 if he moves off the diagonal or trade for the bishop.  Getting a little of trading even however} 23. Be2 Qg6 24. Qd1 {I can post a knight to e4 now.  Is White thinking Bh5? After I reply Qh6, then Rc8+.  Things are about to get interestig.} Ne4 25. Bh5 Qh6 {Rc8+, Bf8 What does White do next - move the queen - lose the bishop, retreat the bishop to threaten the knight?  } 26. Rc8+ Bf8 {current thinking is 28. ...  e5  29. fxe5 Qxe3+.  if 30. Kf1, Qf2#, if 30. Kh1, Nf2+ winning the queen - don't really think he will capture the pawn} 27. Bf3 e5 {lots of different ways this can play.  Will White go for the e pawn?} 28. Nc6 {did not consider the knight move } Rd6 29. Nxe5 Qe6 30. Rc6 g6 31. Qc1 {don't like the queen & rook on the same file - the one I opened up} Nc5 32. Qd1 {d4 pawn in trouble and a white bishop on d4 would be trouble } Ne4 33. Qd4 Bg7 {thinking I might trade the bishop for the knight, can also swap rooks because the knight is pinned to the queen.  He can recapture with the pawn but I will be even again on the pawn capture by the queen.} 34. Bxe4 {did not see the attack on the b pawn } fxe4 35. Qxb6 Bxe5 36. fxe5 Rxc6 37. Qxc6 {down two pawns - don't want to swap, things are not looking good - can't get the king over to help stop the pawn} Qxe5 38. b6 Qb8 39. b7 {resign - cant stop the promotion}
