1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 {I think the exchanges on move 3 lose initiative for white} 4. Bd3 Nf6 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bd2 c5 {6...an agressive move for black} 7. dxc5 Bxc5 {7 black now has the initiative } 8. Qe2+ Be6 9. Nc3 O-O 10. O-O-O {I think 0-O-O is is a positional mistake for white because black has attack possibilities on Q side already in place via Qb6 or Qa5.} Re8 {...Re8 threatens the white Q on e2 with a discovered move by Be6} 11. f3 Nc6 12. Kb1 Nb4 13. a3 Bd7 {Black is having a good time pushing the Q around} 14. Qf1 Nxd3 15. Qxd3 Qb6 {...Qb6 launches blacks attack} 16. Ka1 d4 17. Nb1 {Nb1 seems too passive...White assumes a totally defensive posture.} Bb5 {...Bb5 pushes around the Q again} 18. Qb3 {Not the best square for the white Q retreat}
