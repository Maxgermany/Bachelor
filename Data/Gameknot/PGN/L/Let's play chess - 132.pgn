1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. b4 {For some reason, I got it into my head to play the Wing Gambit.  I was not able to pull it off.  My opponent played well and I was never able to get a strong position.} cxb4 4. d4 {I think a better continuation here might have been a3.  My attempts at Bb2 have also not been very successful.} Nf6 {Black forces the action right away by hitting an hanging pawn.} 5. Bd3 g6 6. O-O Bg7 7. a3 bxa3 8. Rxa3 {I think Bxa3 was probably the proper continuation here.  } O-O 9. h3 {This was probably a wasted move.  Nbd2 seems stronger in retrospect.  Since I've gambited a pawn, I've got to hang on to a lead in development.} Nbd7 10. c3 a6 11. Bf4 Qc7 12. Nbd2 Nh5 13. Bh2 {Be3 might have been a better square for the Bishop.  It would have ultimately had more influence on the center.} e5 14. d5 Nc5 {Now both of my Bishops are pretty bad.  Black has some good squares for his Ns.} 15. Bc2 Bd7 16. c4 Nf4 {White is saddled with a very weak c-pawn.} 17. Bxf4 exf4 18. Ne1 Rae8 19. f3 Bd4+ 20. Kh1 f5 {Black is doing an excellent job of trading pieces, which will tend to magnify my positional weaknesses.} 21. Nd3 fxe4 22. fxe4 Nxe4 23. Nxf4 Nf2+ 24. Rxf2 Bxf2 25. Nd3 Bb6 {Now White is down a piece with a horribly uncoordinated positions.  Black has the Bishop pair--and a pair of Rooks.  } 26. Ne1 Bc5 27. Rf3 Rxf3 28. Nexf3 Be3 29. Ne4 {Threatening Nf6, which can be easily foiled.} Rf8 30. Qe2 Bh6 31. Neg5 Qd8 32. Ne6 Bxe6 33. dxe6 {This is weak, but the more natural Qxe6 doesn't go anywhere either.  White is lost unless Black walks into a trap.} Re8 34. Be4 Qc7 35. Bd5 Kh8 36. Qb2+ Bg7 37. Qd2 {Qxb7 doesn't really win a pawn.  After ...Qxb7, Bxb7, Rxe6 ends any threat from the advanced e-pawn.} b5 38. cxb5 axb5 39. Qg5 Qe7 40. Qd2 {Trading Queens was probably better here.  Black would have had more trouble dealing with the e-pawn because the Bishop can't attack it.} Qc7 41. Bb3 Bf6 42. Bd5 Kg7 43. Qd1 Qc5 44. Qd2 b4 45. Qd1 Rb8 46. Bb3 {Black steadily improves the position.  The e-pawn has now been handcuffed.} Rc8 47. h4 Kf8 48. Kh2 Ke7 49. Kh3 Qf5+ 50. g4 Qf4 51. Qd5 Rc7 52. h5 Be5 53. Nxe5 dxe5 {Now Black has a second passed pawn--and open lines against White's King.} 54. Kh4 g5+ 55. Kh3 Rc3+ 56. Kg2 Rg3+ {Well-played by Black.  I resigned here.}
