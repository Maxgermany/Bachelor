1. e4 {I've purposely picked a game that ended in September of 2005 so that I have forgotten my ideas, and can be more objective about my annotation.  I don't pretend to be perfect! This is an attempt for me to get better, so if you see a hole in my logic feel free to message me! Also, if you see any typos please message me as I think they're ugly. Thanks!  I want to give a lot of thanks to rt4sm for reviewing my analysis and pointing out holes in my logic! Many of my comments revolving around ...Nxg4 have been changed as per his analysis.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 {This position seems to be begging for 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 applying more pressure to the pinned Knight on c6. If 4. ...Bg4 then 5. d5! winning the Knight.} 4. Bxc6+ {Although, 4. Bxc6  causes Black to take on doubled pawns, they seem strong as they facilitate ...d5, blasting open the center and allowing Black's light-squared Bishop to barrel down the long diagonal.} bxc6 5. d4 {This move doesn't look nearly as good now that the pinned Knight is gone. However, it's not bad as if Black plays anything that doesn't capture the pawn on d4 (other than 5. ...Qe7 which will force him to have the ugly pawn island) he is forced to isolate his doubled c pawns, and if he doesn't he'll be forced to take on an ugly pawn island consisting of c6, c7, and d6.} Bg4 {Black chooses to isolate his pawns.} 6. dxe5 dxe5 7. Qxd8+ {Unpinning the Knight.} Rxd8 8. Nbd2 {8. Nxe5?? Rd1#} Nf6 {Black fails to address the threat of 9. Nxe5 (if 9. ...Nxe4? 10. Nxg4). However White failed to see that, probably thinking that the checkmate threat was still relevant.} 9. O-O Bb4 10. c3 {This, 11. h3, and 12. g4 were designed to make the environment a little more Knight friendly. By constraining the Bishops' squares, White gives his Knights the potential to grow into powerhouses. With targets on e5, c6, and a7, they should soon be able to rampage across the board grazing off whatever suits them.} Ba5 11. h3 Bh5 12. g4 Bg6 13. Nxe5 {Finally, White's Knight captures the pawn left hanging on e5. His Knight is also threatening to take the hanging c6 pawn.} Rd6 {A terrible move! After 14. Nc4! Re6 15. Nxg6 hxg6 16. Nxa5 White is up a piece! It's a good thing for Black that White missed it!} 14. f3 Bb6+ 15. Kg2 O-O 16. Nxg6 {White's steed on e5 was much better than Black's Bishop on g6! Why trade it? White has an evil plan.} fxg6 17. Nc4 {Here it is! After the White does away with the Bishop slicing into his kingside, his Bishop becomes a total powerhouse! Black's left with a ruined pawn structure on his kingside and a terrible Knight with no support points, while White has a great Bishop (who will only be inactive for one move), connected Rooks, and a healthy pawn structure on both sides. Plus White is up a pawn!  Of course, White's game would have been much easier after 17. e5! winning a piece!} Rd7 18. Bf4 {White decides to develop his Bishop before capturing Black's. This also puts pressure on c7, which forces the Black Bishop to stay on b6.} h6 {A wasted tempo. Even if it prepares ...g5, White's Bishop simply moves away, and White will have gained a full tempo.} 19. Nxb6 cxb6 20. Rfd1 {White steps into a trap. Now if 20. ...Rxd1 21. Rxd1 Nxe4! eliminating White's passed pawn and his Bishop all at once! Plus Black will eliminate the material inequality.} g5 {Black has now destroyed his own threat. After the Bishop moves, the discovery is gone and Black can't equalize.} 21. Be5 Rxd1 22. Rxd1 {The weakness of Black's Knight can really be seen here: It has two squares, e8 and h7. Neither of there are very welcoming to a Knight in an endgame.} c5 {This just puts pawns on dark squares for the Bishop's later enjoyment.} 23. a3 a6 {The losing move. After 24. Rd6 Black loses a pawn. If he tries to defend it via ...Rb8, then Rxf6! winning a piece. If he pushes it to b5, he loses the pawn on a6, and if he tries to keep White from winning too much by playing ...Ra8, then 25. Bxf6 gxf6 26. Rxf6 and the loss of 3 pawns is too much to fight back against.  rt2sm has commented saying: Surprisingly it doesn't cost black a pawn straight away, if 25. Rxb6 is played Nd7! Wins the rook for the knight (defending the bishop with 26. Re6 fails to Kf7.) Certainly though white will be able to win it soon, so definitely time to resign for black...} 24. Rd6 {1-0}
