1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 Nc6 7. f3 e6 8. Qd2 Be7 9. O-O-O O-O {this was the first mistake.  Black should NOT have castled, as his king was much safer in the center.} 10. g4 {starting a pawn storm that would turn out to be decisive.} h6 11. h4 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 b5 {A terrible move!  Black still had hopes of saving the game with Nh7 or other strong moves, but this blatant absence of paying attention to white's threats is punished swiftly.} 13. g5 hxg5 {another blunder!  had black not taken the pawn, his game would have been bad, but he would have a chance.} 14. hxg5 Nd7 {Nh7 holds out slightly longer.} 15. Qh2 {there is no defense at this point.  Black has opened the KR file, and now he must pay the piper.} f6 16. g6 {Black resigned, as there is no way to even slow down the inevitable mate at h8.}
