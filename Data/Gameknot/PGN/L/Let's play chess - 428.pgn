[Opening "Vienna gambit (C29), Kaufmann variation"]

1. e4 {I emerged out of the opening with better development and initiative, white decided to end the game soon after it forcing a draw by 3-fold repetition, I need to find some improvement because this line seams great for black...} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. fxe5 {Vienna gambit (C29), Kaufmann variation} Nxe4 5. Nf3 Bc5 6. d4 Bb4 7. Bd2 c5 8. Bb5+ Nc6 9. O-O O-O 10. a3 Bxc3 11. Bxc3 {N, already tried is bxc3 in Mayo Casademont Andreu (ESP) - Guadamuro Torrente Ana Isabel (ESP), Mondariz (Spain), 2005 which black eventually won, with the novelty played the resulting game is more open, let's see if it is a sound move...} Nxc3 {of course the obvious capture, that white is expecting} 12. bxc3 Qa5 {almost forced the exchange now, and then black needs to defend the c3 pawn, so I will be able to play Rb8 occupying the open b column} 13. Bxc6 bxc6 {keeping the only bishop on board might be valuable latter on when the position opens up a little more} 14. Qe1 Rb8 {occupying the open column and threatening Rb2} 15. Rf2 h6 {preventing Ng5} 16. Qe3 {forces my reply} cxd4 {forced, or I'll lose a pawn} 17. Nxd4 {cxd4 maybe better, with this reply white has a worst endgame if all pieces are exchanged} Bd7 {connecting rooks} 18. Rf6 {very sharp play by white, I can't play gxf6 due to Qxh6 and I don't have salvation on Bf5 due to Nxf5 and black loses} c5 19. Nb3 {I can now proceed to capture the f6 rook, but first I need to interpose a quality sacrifice to  get rid of the b3 knight} Rxb3 {now white must capture and I have gxf6 next, while this allows white to force a draw if he wants it, let's hope he goes for a win, because then I might be able to coordinate my pieces and win myself} 20. cxb3 gxf6 {if exf6 then Kh7 is forced due to the threat of mate in two} 21. exf6 Kh7 {one} 22. Qd3+ {it seams as if he chooses the draw} Kh8 23. Qe3 Kh7 {two} 24. Qd3+ Kh8 {my opponent went in to deep thinking (the previous moves were made in seconds) after this move, does he still wants to avoid the draw?} 25. Qe3 Kh7 {}
