1. d4 d5 {I started with queens pawn to d4 and black moved his pawn to d5.} 2. g3 Bg4 {I now moved my pawn to g3 to allow for my LB to fianchetto and black developed his LB to g4,  Black has placed his LB on a spot where it can get involved very quickly.} 3. Bg2 Nc6 {I bring out my LB to g2 and where it has the diagonal h1 to a8 to keep an eye on.  Black develops his b knight to c6.} 4. c3 Nf6 {I belatedly provide some support to my d4 pawn and bring out pawn to c3. Black now develops his g knight to f6.} 5. Qa4 e6 {I bring out my queen to a4 to pin the knight at c6.  Black brings out pawn to e6 supporting his d5 pawn.} 6. h3 Bf5 {I don't wish to have black's LB hanging around at g3 so I bring out my pawn to h3 and bishop retreats to f5.} 7. Nd2 Ne4 {With black's LB now pointing at my knight on b1 I decide to develop it to d2.  Black moves his f knight to e4.} 8. Bxe4 dxe4 {So I decide to remove the knight at e4 with my LB and black retakes with his d5 pawn.  This has doubled up his pawns on the e file.  I have the pair of knights against black's 2 bishops.  My other bishop is still to be developed.  .} 9. e3 Bd6 {I now bring up my e pawn to e3 to support d4 and black moves his DB out to d5.} 10. b4 a6 {I move my pawn to b4 to provide support as the queen is pinning the knight to the king on a4. Black moves pawn to a6.  Black's DB at d6 cannot attack on the diagonals he currently covers without being captured by white's pawn chain.  At present I have 2 islands of pawns.  I have heard it said that the less pawn islands you have the better you are.  Black currently has 3 pawn islands.} 11. Nc4 b5 {I did not see that the previous move of black was preparing to bring his pawn out and I stupidly brought my knight up to c4 and black moved his b pawn out to b5.  So my queen and my knight were forked.  {You will ask how did I know what move to make when I had no idea of my opponents intentions.}} 12. Qd1 bxc4 {I now retreat my queen back to d1 and black captures my knight at c4.} 13. a3 e5 {I move pawn to a3 and  black moves one of his doubled pawn on the e file to e5.  I now have 1 pawn island as it is all connected.} 14. Qa4 Qd7 {I move my queen back to a4, why not as black's knight is still there.  Black moves his queen to d7.  He can now castle long or short as all pieces are developed.  However I  still have 2 pieces to develop so perhaps it would have been better to develop my pieces rather than put my queen out again.} 15. g4 Bg6 {I push my g pawn to g4 and attack the bishop at f5 which moves back to g6.  } 16. Qc2 a5 {I move my queen back to c2 and black pushes his a pawn to a5.} 17. b5 Na7 {I push my b pawn to b5 and attack the knight at c6 which retreats to a7.} 18. Ne2 exd4 {I finally develop my last knight to e2 and black captures my d4 pawn.} 19. Nxd4 Nxb5 {I capture the d4 pawn with my knight and black moves his knight to b5 and captures my pawn.  I should have seen he was coming back for that pawn!} 20. Qa4 Rb8 {I move my queen out again to a4 attacking knight at b5 and b lack moves his 'A' rook to b8.} 21. Rb1 O-O {I move my 'A' rook to b1 and black's knight at b5 is now in the middle of a pin between our queens at a4 and d7  and our rooks.} 22. Nxb5 Bc5 {I capture black's knight at b5 with my knight and black moves his DB to c5.} 23. f4 c6 {I push my f pawn to f4 and black moves his pawn to c6 attacking my knight at b5.} 24. Qxc4 h6 {I capture black's pawn at c4 with my queen.  Black moves his pawn to h6.} 25. Qxc5 cxb5 {I capture black's DB at c5 with my queen and black captures my knight at b5 with his pawn.} 26. O-O Rbc8 {I now castle short and black moves his 'B' rook over to c8 attacking my queen at c5.} 27. Qxb5 Rxc3 {I capture the pawn on b5 with my queen and black moves his c rook down to c3 capturing my pawn and attacking my bishop at c1 and a pawn at a3.} 28. f5 Bh7 {I now push my f pawn which pushes the bishop back and he retreats to h7.} 29. Qxd7 Rxa3 {I capture black's queen on d7 while black's rook captures my pawn at a3.  } 30. Bxa3 {I recapture the rook and black decides to resign.  He has a rook and a bishop but I have an extra rook and my queen.}
