1. e4 c5 2. Qf3 e6 3. d3 d5 4. Nd2 Nc6 5. Qg3 g6 6. Nb3 Bg7 7. Bg5 Nge7 8. Rc1 {Ok, what?  This does not protect Pb2.  Why not castle queen's side?} Nb4 9. Qh4 {Pa2 is vulnerable too now.} f6 10. Bxf6 O-O 11. Bxe7 {Free knight, almost.  Still must protect the queen before you can retract the bishop.} Qd7 {Oh, take the rook!} 12. Bxf8 {Nice.} Bxf8 13. Nf3 Be7 14. Qf4 Nxa2 15. Ne5 Qe8 16. exd5 {Did you forget your rook?} Nxc1 17. Nxc1 exd5 18. h4 Bd6 19. c4 {Pd4, PxP, Nc1d3 saves the knight.} Bxe5 20. Qh6 {Nope.  Queen cannot be on any black square black's bishop can attack by discovered check.  Bg7 or Bf4 and the white queen bites the dust.} Bf4+ 21. Ne2 {I would have used the bishop.  You could move the knight later.} Bxh6 22. Kd1 {From here it looks like force mate.} Qa4+ 23. Ke1 Qa1+ 24. Nc1 Qxc1+ 25. Ke2 Bg4+ 26. f3 Qe3+ {Nope.  Qd2#.  Black does not need a wall, and is just drawing it out.} 27. Kd1 Qd2# {}
