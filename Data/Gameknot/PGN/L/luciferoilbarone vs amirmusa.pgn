1. g3 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bg2 e5 4. d3 h6 {an unusual move for black in Reti opening } 5. O-O Bc5 6. b3 Be6 7. Bb2 {i'm trying to attack in the Q side} Qd6 8. c4 d4 9. Nbd2 f5 10. a3 {the centre is blocked, my opponent and me are trying to attack on the Q and K sides} a6 {good move for the black. it creates a place for the bishop and looks for b5... maybe a5 would have been better, but i don't want to criticize this good move} 11. b4 Ba7 12. c5 Qd7 13. Nc4 {black i resist to my attack and so i want to be offensive in the Q side and if we exchange the pieces i ca n look forward to moving b5 } Bxc4 14. dxc4 Qe6 15. Qc2 {probably a mistake... i should have played Qb3 because it would have been more aggressive but... } Nge7 16. Rfe1 Rd8 {good move!!! the d4 pawn is actually important for black and to defend it is a good move. 0-0-0 would have been a suicide} 17. Rad1 {I'm trying to preserve d3} O-O 18. e4 {i hoped he took  in e3 but he didn't} f4 19. Kh1 Ng6 20. b5 {bad move because i lose a pawn... i should have waited and tried different moves to prepare b5... but a pawn won't make me resign!!!} Na5 21. b6 cxb6 22. cxb6 Bxb6 23. c5 Rdc8 {i expected this move but this was the only way to defend c4 pawn} 24. Ng1 {i can't defend my pawn so i invited him to move Rc8 to hope in Bh3} Bxc5 25. Bh3 {and lose the rook } Qd6 26. Bxc8 Rxc8 27. Qb1 {i want to enter with the queen by Qa2 } Bxa3 28. Qa2+ Nc4 29. Rdc1 Bxb2 {the only chance to save the bishop} 30. Rxc4 Rxc4 31. Qxc4+ Kh7 32. Qb3 Bc3 33. Rd1 Qc6 {i thought to have won after f3 and then Kg2 with the rook for the bishop} 34. gxf4 {BAD LUCK} Nxf4 {BAD LUCK } 35. Nf3 {ONE OF MY FRIENDS AT THE SCHOOL DID THIS TWO HORRIBLE MOVES} Qxe4 {looking for check mate} 36. Qb1 {i tried to save the position but...} d3 {and i must take the pawn with the rook} 37. Rxd3 Nxd3 38. Kg2 {this is  the best error of my entire life!!!!!!!!! i was busy and i mistook Nf4  is the end!!!!!!!!!} Nf4+ {and i resigned... a part from the final errors i think this has been a real good match.... i look forward to playing against amusa another time( without my friend's help!!!!!!!!!)}
