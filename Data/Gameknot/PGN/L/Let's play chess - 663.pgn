1. e4 e5 {Started with the king pawns taking the center. Pretty ordinary.} 2. Qh5 {He brings the queen out attacking my pawn.  I've messed up many times in this situation before by trying to chase the queen away with g6.} Nc6 {So I decided to just protect my pawn and at the same time develop a piece.  } 3. Bc4 {It always takes me a couple a minutes to respond to this attack. } g6 {now I thrust out g6 and this is why I had new I had to bring out my knight in the previous turn.  Also later on if i want to i can fianchetto the bishop. } 4. Qf3 {He is still going for the quick mate so I just block that square with...} Nf6 {Nf6. I think its a good developing move and next move I can develop my bishop.  In general I love it when the opponent brings his queen out too early because it is sometimes easier to develop your own pieces while attacking his queen.} 5. c3 {I can see his idea is probably to take control of the center with d4 on his next move. } Bh6 {so I figured that I could pin his pawn to his bishop and with this move he cannot properly develop his queen side pieces.   } 6. Ne2 {he brings out his knight to e2 the only place it can really go while his queen is taking up the f3 square. Obviously he is planning to castle.} d6 {It took me a while to decide whether or not i was going to castle king side I did not like how the pawn structure was a little messed up for proper protection, so decided that I should try to bring my bishop into the game and also start preparing for a queen side castle.} 7. O-O {Castles king side and in my opinion I think this was his only good move cause now his knight on e2 does not have to guard the bishop on c1, therefore his knight is free to attack the d4 square when he brings his pawn to d4. } Be6 {It took me a while to determine where to put my bishop and in the end I figured that right now his only good piece that is on the board and I just thought it was a good trade. Plus after bxe6, then fxe6 I think that even though i have a temporary weakness having doubled up pawns. I planned attacking the center with my d pawn and if we trad pawns my center position would be strong and plus I figured by opening up the f-file my rook would have a nice place to go.} 8. Bxe6 fxe6 9. d4 {we trade bishops and then he attacks with his d pawn.} Bxc1 {I could have brought my bishop to g7 but I did not want to let him take control of the h6-c1 diagonal and I did not want to lose tempo. so I took his bishop...} 10. Rxc1 {...and he took back. At this point I think his position is a little better then mine because of his center pawns.} Rf8 {I put my rook onto the half-open file which I think is usually a good move at least now i have a possible discovered attack opportunity.} 11. Qe3 {Of course he will not give me the opportunity but at least I drove his queen away just a little bit.} Ng4 {I attack his queen and the f2 pawn at least maybe I can win a pawn.} 12. Qg3 Nxf2 {He attacked my knight on g4 then I took his pawn. } 13. Nd2 {When I calculated my last move, taking the pawn with my knight, I was also attacking his e-pawn so i was worried when he brought his knight to d3 guarding it. I thought at this point that I might lose my knight especially if he brings his rook to f1.  } d5 {It took me along time to figure out what to do but I figured that my only hope was to get a pawn onto d5 so my f2 knight would have a place recede to. so I attacked with my d pawn.} 14. exd5 exd5 {thankfully he took my pawn and I took back and now I have a little bit of relief for my knight.} 15. dxe5 Qe7 {He gains his pawn back and I knew that I couldn't take his pawn so I brought out another attacker and was also trying to get my king to safety.} 16. Nf3 Ne4 {He guards the pawn with his knight but now I can move my knight to e4 and attack his queen.} 17. Qh3 {He moves his queen out of the way but now he is eying my h7 pawn so I can't go for the e pawn right away because now my queen has to guard my h7 pawn and now coincidentally I can't castle my king to safety.  } h5 18. Ng3 {For a few moves now in the back of my head I saw that i could check his king with my queen but now I see something even better. It took me a long time to figure this out but if somehow I can get him to  move his f3 knight away from guarding the d4 space then I've got this game won.} Nxe5 {So after about 5 or 10 minutes debating the outcomes of what would happen if he didn't take on e5; I figured that i would come out ahead with at least a pawn advantage so I went for it.} 19. Nxe5 {Yes he took it. I was so happy when he took because I couldn't believe that I was able to see this forced mate, and its my favorite kind of mate. } Qc5+ {After I checked him I told the guy that it had been a good game and he saw what the outcome was and just resigned.  I think you can pretty much figure out what the forced mate is but just in case it is: 19...Qc5+ 20. Kh1 Nf2+ 21. Kg1 Nxh3+ 22. Kh1 Qg1+ 23. Rxg1 Nf2# Smothered Mate baby. This is one of my favorite games that I have played because at times I really felt I had to work hard to figure out my moves.  Also, this is the first time I have ever been able to do a smothered mate, which makes it pretty.  Please make comments I'll take any opinions or advice that anyone has to give.  Also this is my first annotated game so could you please rate this .}
