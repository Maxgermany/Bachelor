1. e4 {My preferred opening move.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 {This was a foreign move to me in the Ruy Lopez.} 4. d3 Bd7 5. O-O Nf6 6. Nc3 Be7 7. Be3 {Each side seems to be gaining nice control over the centre.} O-O 8. Qd2 Re8 9. Rad1 a6 {Black provokes the bishop to either exchange or retreat.} 10. Bxc6 {I decided to exchange it.} Bxc6 11. h3 {Simply preventing the future move Ng4.} Bf8 {This is the move in which I do not understand Black's intentions. I would appreciate your comments if you have any ideas. } 12. Rfe1 d5 {I was not eager to trade my e pawn as I believe it was contributing more on its own than my d pawn. Of course I had to do something about 13. ... d4.} 13. Bg5 {And so I move the bishop to attack the knight.} Qd6 14. Bxf6 gxf6 {This came as somewhat of a surprise to me. I expected him to capture with the queen.} 15. Nh4 d4 16. Nb1 {The white knight on b1 is looking a little silly as it will take several more moves to get it to a square where it will be useful.} Bd7 17. Qe2 {Preparing both to bring the queen into the attack and to place the knight on a better square.} Be7 18. Qf3 Be6 19. Qg3+ {The attack on the black king has begun.} Kh8 20. Nd2 b5 21. Ref1 Qd7 22. f4 Reg8 23. Qh2 {Black has acquired control of the g file and turned the attack around.} exf4 24. Kh1 {The pin on the g pawn has been released.} Rg7 {Black is looking to double up the rooks, strengthening the assault he has on the white king.} 25. Qxf4 {Still it seemed reasonable to eat up that pawn and bring the material points back to even.} Rag8 26. Rf3 Rg7g5 {I don't understand this move.} 27. Nf1 f5 28. exf5 Bd5 29. Qe5+ Bf6 {It seems like he should have blocked with one of the rooks.} 30. Qxf6+ {The queen can simply capture the unguarded bishop.} Rg5g7 31. Rg3 c5 32. Rxg7 Rxg7 33. Ng3 {Both sides must have realized that if Black does not move the king, the white knight will come to h5 and the queen will checkmate on g7 the next move.} Kg8 34. Nh5 {However, the black rook still has no safe square to which it can move, and if it does not move, the queen will take it and checkmate the king.}
