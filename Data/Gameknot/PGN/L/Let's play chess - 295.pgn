1. d4 d5 2. g3 Nc6 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. c4 g6 {The Grunfeld opening} 5. Nc3 Bg7 {Black is careless, he should have played dxc4 first.} 6. cxd5 {How obvious...} Nb8 7. e4 {In just two moves white has gained massive advantage, after just one single mistake by black.} O-O 8. Bg5 {Strengthening white's grip on the fields d5/e4} c6 {I investigated returning the pawn with e5, but it brings nothing} 9. dxc6 bxc6 {Keeping the option open to attack the center with c6-c5, but at the const of another tempo. Its probably better than Nxc6 however, as that leaves white's mighty center formation unchallenged} 10. Nge2 {In order to answer Bg4 with f3.} Qa5 11. e5 {Winning another pawn...} Nd5 12. Bxd5 {Trading this bisshop had to be considered carefully, as the fields h3/g2 are exposed to black bishop. However after carefull calculations, I deemed the trade safe.} cxd5 13. Bxe7 {Two pawns up, white has a big advantage now.} Re8 14. b4 {Short intermezzo to remove the Queen form the a5-e1 diagonal.  Also I am improving my pawn formation.} Qc7 15. Bc5 {Solid.} Bg4 16. Qb3 {using the standalone d5 pawn ad a diversion} Bf3 {Veru understandable, and at first sight this seems strong. Yet this is the third mistake, giving white an even bigger material lead.} 17. Nxd5 {Of course, exploiting the fact that Bf3 is exposed.} Bxd5 18. Qxd5 Nd7 19. O-O {Safe, finally} Rad8 20. Qb3 {Nice try, but I am not falling into such traps.} Rdb8 {Threatening Nxc5 this time} 21. Rac1 Nxc5 22. Rxc5 Qb6 23. a3 Red8 24. Rfc1 {White has a winning advantage} Qb7 {Another mistake, which makes life easier for white} 25. Rc5c7 Qd5 {Forced, byut now I can trade Queens...} 26. Qxd5 Rxd5 27. Rxa7 {And win another pawn, and occupy the 7th rank. Jummy} f5 28. Rcc7 Bf8 29. Rcxh7 {And another pawn, but it could not be saved by any means} Rc8 30. Rhc7 {Not allowing even the slightest counter play} Rdd8 31. b5 {If RxR, Rxr, Bxa3 then b6 wins quickly.} Rcb8 32. a4 Rb6 33. f4 {White decides to manouver a bit, before the pawns start marching. Its probably a bit slow.} Rbb8 34. Kf2 Rb6 {Black has no plan and real good moves.} 35. Ke3 Rbb8 36. Nc3 Bb4 37. Kd3 {Wanna trade?} Rba8 {Hoping for RxR, after which the a pawn falls.} 38. Nd5 {Another nice move, made possible by my large pawn advantage. Blak must trade rooks, or he willbe checkmated.} Rxa7 39. Nf6+ Kf8 40. Rxa7 Rc8 41. Nd5 {Again not allwoing black any counterplay} Ba3 42. b6 {Finally the pawn amrches, and this time she is unstoppable.} Rb8 43. b7 Kf7 {Avoiding Ra8} 44. a5 Ke6 45. Nb6 {Blocking the kings route to the pawns} Ke7 46. a6 {Black surrendered, he has no defence left against Ra8}
