1. d4 {Thus begins a long and rather interesting game.} d5 2. c4 Nc6 {The Queen's Gambit Declined: Viennese Defence, I think. Not a common move.} 3. Nc3 dxc4 {Now we branch into the Queen's Gambit Accepted.} 4. d5 {I play my favourite line.} Ne5 5. f4 Ng4 6. e4 {I take advantage of my harassment of his knight to build up a big centre.} b5 7. Nxb5 {Was this a blunder on my opponent's part?} a6 8. Nc3 c5 9. Bxc4 {I now have an immelsely powerful pawn centre...but my opponent looks as though he wants to invade down the queenside.} Qb6 10. Qb3 Qa5 11. Bd2 Qc7 12. Nf3 {My opponent is now well behind in development.} a5 13. O-O Qd6 14. e5 {Just to annoy him, really. And to push back his position.} Qg6 15. Bb5+ Bd7 16. Qa4 {I am trying to build up pressure on my opponent's king and tie down his few active pieces, taking advantage of his lack of development.} Rd8 17. Bxd7+ Rxd7 18. e6 {This looks like a strong move, trying to take advantage of the pin on my opponent's rook. In reality, though, it just ruins my pawn centre.} fxe6 19. dxe6 Qxe6 20. Rae1 Qd6 21. Re2 Ng8f6 22. Ne5 {This is DEFINITELY a strong move, winning Black's pinned rook unless 22...Nxe5, when 23.fxe5 forks Black's queen and knight.} Nxe5 23. fxe5 Qd4+ 24. Qxd4 cxd4 {Black has wriggled out of it!} 25. exf6 dxc3 26. Bxc3 gxf6 27. Bxf6 {At least I win the pawn.} Rg8 28. g3 Rg6 29. Bc3 Rd5 30. Ree1 h5 31. Red1 Rxd1 32. Rxd1 {I am trying to exchange off all of the pieces so that my pawn advantage will be more advantageous.} Ra6 33. Kf2 a4 34. b3 axb3 35. axb3 Rc6 36. Bb4 Rc2+ 37. Rd2 Rc6 38. Kf3 Rf6+ 39. Ke4 Rg6 40. Bc3 {Black clearly doesn't want any exchanges.} Rg4+ 41. Kf3 Kf7 42. Rd4 Rg5 43. Rf4+ Ke8 44. h4 Rc5 45. Bd4 Rb5 46. Re4 Rxb3+ 47. Re3 Rb5 48. Re5 Bg7 {Black has won back the pawn...but this has to be a blunder.} 49. Rxb5 Bxd4 50. Ke4 Bg7 51. Rxh5 Kf7 52. Rf5+ Kg8 53. g4 {Being an exchange down is not Black's only problem...he is being menaced by my kingside pawns.} Bf6 54. g5 Bg7 55. h5 e6 56. Rc5 Kf7 57. Rc7+ {I am after that bishop's head.} Kg8 58. Re7 e5 59. h6 Bh8 60. g6 {Black's bishop has to be trapped...even without Black's next move...} Kf8 61. g7+ Bxg7 62. hxg7+ Kg8 {Black's only feasible move.} 63. Kxe5 Kh7 64. g8=Q+ Kxg8 {Simplifying the board. It's easy to checkmate with rook and king, and a crucial skill to learn.} 65. Re6 Kf7 66. Kf5 Kg7 67. Kg5 Kf7 68. Re5 Kg7 {Black is procrastinating, trying to stave off his fate.} 69. Re7+ Kf8 70. Kf6 Kg8 71. Re8+ Kh7 {A classic rook-and-king checkmating position.} 72. Ra8 {Anywhere along the 8-rank would do to force checkmate, but I am a big fan of being needlessly stylish and flash!} Kh6 73. Rh8# {BOOM. The king is dead, long live the king.}
