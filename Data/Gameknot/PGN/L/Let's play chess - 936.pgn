1. e4 {This is a very interesting game, in which the struggle was centred around outposts, the half-open b-file, and penetration into the opponent's territory. I (bishop18) playing white, succeeded in beating a higher rated opponent in spectacular fashion.} e6 {The french defense.} 2. d4 d5 {The usual position in the french defense. It generally leads to closed positions after 3. e5. However, I had a different idea.} 3. exd5 exd5 4. c4 {Players who play the french defense tend to like slow, positional, closed games. With this line, the board is suddenly open, and black gets an open, explosive, tactical battle instead of what he wanted.  This line is not popular and not effective according to the game DB, but my experiences have shown that this is the proper way to play the french defense.} Bb4+ 5. Bd2 {Nc3 would weaken my pawn structure in the case of an exchange, and Nd2 blocks my bishop.} Bxd2+ 6. Nxd2 Nf6 7. c5 {Closes up the game, but now I don't have to worry about the pawn tension at d5 and c4. Even still, this is nothing compared to the closure the game would be in if I played the standard french defense.   Taking the d-pawn would be a mistake because after Nxd5 the black knight would be well placed and it would be hard to knock it away, as my d-pawn would be isolated.} O-O 8. Ngf3 Re8+ {Putting the rook on an open file with gain of time by checking.} 9. Be2 Bg4 10. O-O {Quickly getting out of danger.} Nc6 {Black now tries to hunt down the d4 pawn, the biggest weakness in my position.} 11. h3 {knocking away the bishop.} Bxf3 12. Nxf3 {12. Bxf3? loses to 12. ... Nxd4} Ne4 {The black knight finds a comfortable outpost.} 13. Re1 Ne7 {Relocating the knight to the kingside, to start up an attack on my king.} 14. Bd3 {Threatening to eliminate the strong knight and win a pawn.} f5 15. Qb3 {Activating my queen to her best square.} Kh8 {Black wants to get off my queen's diagonal, but that is a mistake because of my next move.} 16. Qxb7 {The b-pawn was under attack too. The half-open b-file will soon become an important factor in this game.} a5 {Taking the pawn out of my queen's reach.} 17. Ne5 {Black has a good knight on e4, so level things out by putting my knight to its best square too. My advantage here is that Black's knight can get chased away with f3, but my knight is out of the reach of his pawns.} Rf8 18. f3 Nf6 19. Rab1 {This way I won't lose my b-pawn if Black plays Rb8, chasing my queen off the b-file.} Qb8 20. Qxb8 {When you are up in material, it's good to exchange pieces.} Raxb8 21. Bc2 {Preparing to move the bishop to a better place on the board. I need to wait to see which square is best though, but Bc2 can't hurt.} Rb4 22. a3 {Biggest mistake by me in this game. I was distracted because of my other games and I missed the capture.} Rxd4 23. Rbd1 {However, now the rook has no way out, except Rh4, which is totally harmless.} Rxd1 {So, Black chooses to exchange.} 24. Rxd1 c6 25. Ba4 {Now that things have become more clear, it is obvious that a4 is the best square for the bishop} Rc8 26. Rd3 {Preparing to go to b3 and then penetrate into Black's camp.} Rc7 {Black has no attack prospects, so he waits.} 27. Rb3 Nd7 {Challenging my strong knight. I accepted the exchange, as I was winning, and simplifying things makes it easier. Also, the c-pawn was under attack, so I couldn't refuse.} 28. Nxd7 g6 {The idea is to prevent a bad back-rank situation that would occur after Rb8 . However, this allows me to retreat my knight, winning material for me.} 29. Rb8+ Kg7 30. Ne5 g5 31. g4 {pushing forward my pawns in preperation for an endgame.} Kf6 32. Nd3 Ng6 33. Rb6 {Threatening to win the c-pawn.} Ne7 {c6 is defended twice again.} 34. Kf2 {Activating my king, to get him in the action.} f4 35. Ke2 Ke6 36. Kd2 Kd7 {Defending c6 again. Black is in an entirely defensive game because of that pawn.} 37. Kc3 Ng6 {The threat is Nh4 and Nxf3.} 38. Kd4 {My king is on an excellent square now.} h6 39. Ne5+ Nxe5 40. Kxe5 Rc8 {Black resigned here, as he is down a minor piece, and he is sure to lose more material, either because c6 will fall, or because my king would hunt down his kingside pawns.  A fine example of strategy and foresight by White.}
