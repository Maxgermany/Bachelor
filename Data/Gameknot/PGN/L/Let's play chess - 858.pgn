[Opening "Queen's Gambit (D06)"]

1. d4 {In this game, Black employs an odd opening, and I am forced to show why 2...h6 is an obscure line...} d5 2. c4 h6 {A very odd line.  Black is trying to take me out of my opening repertoire, but there is a reason that no one plays this line.  2...h6 neglects the center, so I develop classically, which I feel is the best way to meet out-of-book moves. } 3. Nc3 Nf6 {This transposes to a short of Gruenfeld exchange line, without the bishop fianchettoed at g7.} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 {Taking the center.} Nxc3 6. bxc3 a6 {Another weak move, neglecting the center.  My response, play classically and develop my pieces actively.} 7. Bc4 Qd6 {Breaking the known rule "Don't bring your queen out too early"} 8. Nf3 Nc6 9. O-O Bg4 10. Qb3 {Attacking the two weak points b7 and f7} e6 11. Qxb7 {So White has gained a material advantage from his positional one.} Rb8 12. Qxa6 Bxf3 13. gxf3 {Not really a weakness as it simply strengthens White's center and his king is perfectly safe.} Be7 14. e5 {actually a weak move on my part.  I should not have forced things, instead developing the dark squared bishop would have been better.} Qd7 15. Bb5 Rb6 16. Qa4 O-O {This shows the weakness of my continuation.  I have allowed Black to develop and castle, yet White's material advantage still guarantees his success.} 17. Be3 Rfb8 18. c4 Rb8b7 19. Qd1 Bg5 20. f4 Bxf4 {???  I have not idea, what provoked this move.} 21. Bxf4 Qxd4 22. Qxd4 Nxd4 23. Be3 c5 24. Bxd4 cxd4 25. Rfd1 {The pawn is lost, white has a material advantage of +4.} Ra7 26. Rxd4 Rb8 27. a4 Rf8 28. Rad1 Raa8 {Black is left to passivity while White controls the 7th and advances his passed pawns.} 29. c5 Kh7 30. c6 f6 31. exf6 Rxf6 32. Rd4d8 Rg6+ 33. Kf1 Rxd8 34. Rxd8 e5 35. c7 {Blacked resigned.  He can not stop the pawn.}
