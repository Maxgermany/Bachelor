[Opening "English opening (A21)"]

1. c4 {One of my favorite openings. It's flexible and usually gives White the Q-side spatial advantage.} e5 {Logical.} 2. Nc3 {I intend P-Q3 and a fianchetto of my KB, giving me control of the light squares.} Qf6 {Very unusual, and a little premature to develop the Q. It also blocks the Black KN from its natural square.} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Nge7 {Now because of Black's Q and KN, his KB is blocked in.} 5. Bg2 h6 6. O-O {My King is now safe and I still have both center Pawns held in reserve to open the position at my leisure.} d6 {Strengthening the center and preparing to castle Q-side. With the K-side development so fouled up, he has little choice.} 7. d3 Bd7 8. Bd2 {I begin making preparations for a Q-side attack, since Black will be forced to put his K on that side of the board.} O-O-O 9. Nd5 {First step: open a line for my QR to use.} Nxd5 10. cxd5 {Mission accomplished.} Nd4 {A mistake. This piece should have stayed on the Q-side to guard the King. 10...N-N1! was the proper move. This would also strengthen the QB3 square, in preparation for ...P-QB3, sealing off the QB file as an avenue of attack.} 11. Nxd4 exd4 {The open QB-file is tempting, but first I must secure my Pawns.} 12. b3 g5 13. e4 {My Pawns are now secure, and if Black tries 13...PxP e.p., 14 PxP preserves the intiative with a dicovered attack on the Black Q.} Re8 14. Rc1 {I finally seize the half-open QB file.} h5 {I'm not sure what exactly Black's idea is here. Two Pawns cannot by themselves conduct a successfuil attack. Although maybe the point is to gain space on the K-side.} 15. Qc2 {I double on the QB file, with the intent to weaken the Q-side Pawns... and an ancillary threat of mate, which I didn't think he'd overlook.} h4 {He DID overlook it. Well then...} 16. Qxc7# {...let's go ahead and call it a day.}
