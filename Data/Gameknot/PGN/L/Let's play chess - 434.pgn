1. e4 {white produced a bad novelty, that weakened his pawn structure and allowed a sacrifice that ripped apart his castled king position, the game soon ended } c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bc4 g6 5. d4 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. O-O Nc6 9. Be3 Ne5 10. Bb3 Bd7 11. h3 {N already tried here were Qd2 (1 w/2 l/1 d) and Nd5 (1 game lost by white), also this move is not a great choice in my opinion as weakens the dark squares around white's king} Rc8 {placing the rook on the semi-open c column aimed at Nc3 and c2, or even to play it to c4 aimed a Nd4, all this are thematic strategies for black} 12. Kh1 {prophylaxis removing the king from g1-a7 diagonal } Nh5 {profiting from the previous bad h3, by white, I now make a threat against the dark squares in white's field} 13. Bf2 {needed to defend against Ng3+ that wins a quality} Nc4 {blocks white's bishop and threatens b2} 14. Rb1 {? and I will win a pawn} Nxb2 15. Rxb2 Rxc3 {this combination is thematic in this pawn set-up, white needed to exchange his bishop for the knight to avoid it} 16. Qd2 Qc7 {to leave c8 open for my other rook, while still defending Rc3} 17. Rbb1 b5 {now I'll start a pawn attack aimed at the light squared bishop, a5-a4 and white will lose his bishop, so he needs to defend against it} 18. Ne2 Rc6 {only option} 19. Rbc1 Rc8 {next I'll remove my queen from c7 to leave the doubled rooks} 20. g4 {? again weakening the pawn structure around his king, white can exploit the holes on the dark squares and the weak h3 and f3 pawns} Nf6 {needed to go back to safety, if g5 I have Nh5 again, if e5 then dxe5, if f4 then Nxe4...} 21. Nd4 {? a bad option, white choose to again peruse my rook but now I can play Rc3 again and white doesn't have Ne2 any more due to his weak f3 pawn} Rc3 22. Be1 Qb7 {forced, but not necessarily bad as I intended to make this move anyway, the idea is to connect the rooks on the c column and to threaten Nxe4 sacrificing a knight to rip the pawn structure in front of white's king} 23. Qf2 Nxe4 {white needed to defend e4 other than just with his pawn} 24. fxe4 Rxh3+ {and h3 also falls with tempo} 25. Kg2 Qxe4+ {and again a sacrifice.. to settle the game, if Kxh3, I have Bxg4+ Kh2 Be5+ Kg1 Bxd4 regaining the "invested material" with profit}
