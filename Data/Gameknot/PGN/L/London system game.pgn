1. d4 {// I have to say that English is not my native lenguage so sorry if you can understand me.  I always start with 1.d4. With the london system. I dont like study so much theory and the london has less than other openings. } d5 {The classical responde giving the control in the center with a pawn with the same idea than me.} 2. Bf4 {my bishop go to a interesting square where will work in the h2-b8 diagonal. This a characteristic move in the london system.} Nc6 {His knight go to c6. His idea will be play like chigorin defense with his bishop in g4 to stick my knight trying e5 ASAP.Anyway this is hard thanks to my bishop and pawn that overprotect e5. Besides Knight c6  has a problem the pawn in c7 is blocked and in these structures is important a pawn in c6 to give more squares to the queen and to keep the center.} 3. e3 {I let my white bishop develop and consolidate my small but safe center.} Nf6 4. Nf3 {Im just developing} Bg4 {The first idea of his plan , he is trying e5 but he will never get it.} 5. Nbd2 {I want to capture with my knight in case of bxf3} e6 {He realised he couldnt do e5 so he consolidate his small center with e6} 6. c4 {I start to attack his center. He hasnt the pawn in c6(so he cant do qb6) and my idea is attack the weak pawn in b7 because his white bishop is out of his pawn chain.} Be7 7. Qb3 {First idea of my plan attack the weak pawn} Rb8 {I think its a good move to avoid weaken the pawn chain. I dont like qc8(my tower in c8 will be a problem for black in the future) or qd7 because the queen will play less in these squares.} 8. cxd5 {I wanna use my open C file.} Nxd5 {I think exd5 maybe is safer and more positional but capturing with the knight is a good choice and more dynamic.} 9. Bg3 {He is threating my important bishop so i retreat.} O-O 10. a3 {Maybe unnecessary but i thought b4 square was a bit weak because 3 pieces of black could jump here.} h6 {A wait move? or just a bit useless. It covers some jumps with weaken the castle.} 11. Rc1 {Time to claim my open file.} Bd6 {He porpuse me a change of bishop. Im not interesting to wait a change to open my h file because i wanted to play in queenside. Besides he has the pawn in c7 and not in c6 so i thought my bishop was worse than their.} 12. Bxd6 Qxd6 13. Nc4 {I gain a tempo. I wanted to put a knight in e5} Qe7 14. Nce5 Nxe5 15. Nxe5 Bh5 {I would prefer bf5 so i coudnt play bd3. I think this diagonal is more interesting.} 16. Bd3 {Now i cant play my bishop in a nice diagonal. Bc4 is a good move as well.} f6 {He weaken his kingside but he was scared about my knight} 17. Ng6 Bxg6 18. Bxg6 f5 {He is trying to capture my bishop with queen g5. I have 2 choices h4 to h5 or retreat my bishop. The second option is more solid.} 19. Bh5 Qg5 {Attacking the bishop and g2 at the same time but there is not a problem} 20. Bf3 c6 {His knight is dangerous i cant kick it because f5 is covering e4 and it starts to be dangerous, so i wanna change my worse bishop to his good knight.} 21. O-O {First i wanna be safe.} Qf6 {He is preparing f4 i dident realise it will be a great problem for me.} 22. Bxd5 exd5 {Good idea capturing with e pawn because if he opens c file i ve a good counterplay.} 23. Qd3 {I was thinking in b4,b5 (minor attack) and put a tower in c5 but the good next move it will let me busy.} f4 {i didnt like exf4 because i didnt want my d pawn isolated.} 24. b4 {I need counterplay fast} f3 {Of course not fxe3 and im fine} 25. g3 {Now his plan will be checkmate me maneuvering his queen first and after this the tower.} Qe6 {I had 2 option to defend. king h1 and tower g1 to cover g2 or move my tower and queen f1 to cover g2.} 26. Rfd1 Rf5 {He want to attack my weak king in the h file.} 27. b5 {I ve to do something really fast or i will die. } Rh5 28. Qf1 {He will need more time to checkmate me. I will try to create more counterplay while he is attacking me} Rf8 29. bxc6 bxc6 30. Rc5 {My idea was capture the pawn with my tower and trying to sidetrack his attack} Rh3 31. Rxc6 {Not the best move but maybe annoy a bit. If he takes my tower i take his tower and im better.} Qg4 {Of course he doesnt take and he wanted to qh5 to checkmate me.} 32. Rdc1 {I thought i could trying to force draw.} Qh5 33. Rc6c8 Rxh2 {Now i dont have time without checking} 34. Rxf8+ Kxf8 35. Rc8+ Ke7 {He is clever and he wont go to white squares because my queen will be dangerous for him, and he doesnt retreat with his queen because it will be draw. He wanted to chase my tower.} 36. Rc7+ Kd6 {With qd8 he won. But its not easy to see} 37. Qa6+ Kxc7 38. Qxa7+ Kd6 39. Qb6+ Ke7 40. Qc7+ {Now i ve to be in c file and checking all the time. And its draw. If he try to go 5 file. He will lose a pawn and i will trade queen with qxd5} Kf8 41. Qc8+ Kf7 42. Qc7+ Kg8 43. Qc8+ Kf7 44. Qc7+ Kg6 45. Qc6+ Kh7 46. Qc2+ {Draw. g6 is not valid because i have more checks.}
