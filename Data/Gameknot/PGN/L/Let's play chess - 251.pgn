O-O {The black queen is not dangerous for the moment, the chase can wait.} bxa3 10. Nxa3 {A knight's move toward the edge is usually considered as bad but in this precise case, I thought it was ok, to protect the c pawn and enable a further Nb5} Bc5 {Black opts for an agressive line} 11. d3 {Now the chase begins} Qf4 {The black queen is still exposed} 12. Bc1 Qf5 13. Nh4 {White carries on his plan} Qe6 {Mistake.} 14. Nb5 {menacing a fork by 15.
