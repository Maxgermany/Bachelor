1. e4 {I play black on this one, and the ending is a beauty!  Respectable I do believe!} d6 2. Nf3 e5 3. Bc4 {he's coming after me with the classic knight/bishop combo, lets see how I fair} Be6 4. Bxe6 {take here to disrupt my kings bishop pawn, and cause 2 pawns on the same file...this bothers me} fxe6 5. Nc3 {Knights are on patrol} Nf6 6. d3 c6 {I do this to open the queen, and if he moves his knight it's a nice little pitfall for me with q-a5 } 7. Bg5 {blocking my knight, but the pitfall is slowly coming} d5 8. Nxe5 {this move was a blunder on his part, falling prey to a trap in 3 moves, losing his knight} d4 {pawn up to remove his knight and creating an open horizontal } 9. Ne2 Qa5+ {TRAP SPRUNG!} 10. c3 Qxe5 {good job by me, now his bishop is in peril} 11. Bf4 Qc5 12. Nxd4 e5 13. Nb3 Qe7 {now he can safely move his bishop} 14. Bg5 Nbd7 15. O-O h6 16. Bh4 O-O-O {I'm not a huge fan of the queen side castle, but my pawn situation isn't wonderful on the king side, plus i get my Rook on the same file as his queen} 17. a4 {?} g5 18. Bg3 Qf7 19. f3 Nc5 20. Nxc5 Bxc5+ {It's here that I see my opportunity for the checkmate on h1, I just wasn't sure how exactly what to do with the pawn I knew was coming on p-d4} 21. Kh1 Nh5 22. Bxe5 {now a new problem with the bishop} Rhf8 23. d4 {theres the pawn-d4, but this is forcing him to move his queen} Rfe8 {I plan on taking the bishop} 24. Qe2 {so he moves his queen, but in doing so falls for the trap} Rxe5 {!!!!!!!!!  unsuspecting!! } 25. dxe5 {of course you take the Rook!  lol} Ng3+ {he's forced to take the knight} 26. hxg3 Qh5# {#!   an excellent ending}
