[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 {the opening was uneventful at first} d5 2. e3 e6 3. Bb5+ {White brings his bishop out, and I have a theory..if I can get him to move his oening pieces twice, I gain time} c6 4. Ba4 {like that...leaving me more developed} g6 {I continue my opening strategy} 5. e4 {at this stage, I have an edge in development, white is further ahead in space} Nh6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Nf3 Na6 8. Bf4 O-O 9. Ng5 {at this stage, I am feeling a little penned in, and white is further ahead in development and controls much more space} e5 {So the way to repel an attack on the periphery is to launch an attack in the center} 10. dxe5 {this costs me a pawn} Bg4 11. exd5 {whites fatal move - a pawn and a bishop for a queen } Bxd1 {thus} 12. Kxd1 {now ahead 4 points, I push on} Re8 {rook to an open rank} 13. e6 {This is dangerous - white is making ground with his pawns while I languish in defence} fxe6 {End it I say} 14. Nce4 Qxd5+ {The beginning of the end for white} 15. Nd2 {white retreats and opens the door for me to gain a couple of pieces and further weaken him} Bxb2 {I go on the offensive first for a pawn} 16. Rb1 Qd4 {then for his bishops} 17. Ngf3 {an attempt at defense} Qxf4 {in vein} 18. Rxb2 {with the exchange I emerge another three points ahead} Qxa4 {and in a pretty good position} 19. Ne5 Qa5 20. Re1 {I threaten the knight, but I am really after the king} Rad8 21. Nec4 {an attack on the queen? Not likely!} Qh5+ {instead I can cull several pieces} 22. f3 {and with this move the game is almost over} Qxh2 {My queen on the rampage} 23. Rxb7 {It looks to white like the same game is on at the other end..but its not really} Rda8 {my two castles prevent major damage} 24. Nd6 {his knight presents a small problem - I need teh pawns out of the way so I opt for the pawn while the knight might have been the better choice} Qxg2 {this opens him up} 25. Nd2e4 {and he helps me by doing so himself} Qxf3+ {I am points ahead now and the game is not in doubt} 26. Re2 {not a bad move really} Rab8 {so lets see what he is made of} 27. Nd2 {this move I do not understand.. I think he saw shadows in the closet} Qf8 {so now white has to choose - a knight or a castle...} 28. Rxa7 {naturally he chooses the castle} Qxd6 {so I capture the knight} 29. Rh2 {a fair attack on my knight, but from a position of weakness} Qxh2 {especially since he made a HUGE blunder} 30. Ne4 {well the game is over, and white has not resigned yet} Red8+ {so it is forced} 31. Ke1 Rb1# {Mate}
