1. e4 {This is a game I should have lost. I blundered and lost the queen, and against such as strong player this should have been fatal. Chess shock normally kicks in, and the game is flawed from such a point forward. I had hoped to get a draw, and was surprised to win} g6 2. Nf3 Bg7 3. d4 b6 4. Nc3 Bb7 5. Be3 d6 6. Bd3 Nd7 7. Qd2 Ngf6 8. h3 O-O 9. g4 c5 10. g5 {The attack by the pawns proved to be powerful later in the game} Ne8 11. d5 a6 12. h4 b5 13. h5 b4 {First blunder. I should have seen the attack on b2} 14. Ne2 Bxb2 15. Rb1 Ne5 16. Nxe5 {What choice is there. If I let it be, I would have a fork on the king and queen on 3, I would loose my queen.} Bxe5 17. f4 Bg7 18. f5 Nc7 19. Nf4 {What was I thinking? Serious blunder} Bc3 {At this stage the game was probably over.} 20. Qxc3 {Might as well get the bishop in exchange for the queen. Not a nice feeling.} bxc3 21. Rxb7 {Also captured the bishop, but still seriously down on pieces.} Rb8 22. hxg6 {Got another pawn, and the pawn at g6 can do some damage if ignored. Perhaps not, but it looks dangerous} hxg6 23. Rxb8 {I think he should have taken the rook.} Qxb8 24. Ke2 {Don't want the king pined in front of a defenseless rook} Qb2 25. fxg6 fxg6 26. Nxg6 {Ok, the opponents king is open. I have a rook on h, and a bishop on white.} Rf7 27. Rh8+ Kg7 28. Rh6 Qb1 {Now I have to watch f1. Block the line for the rook} 29. Nf4 Qxa2 30. Nh5+ {I can move the knite back again, now that the queen has moved.} Kg8 31. g6 {Attack is the best defense.} Rf8 32. g7 Re8 33. e5 Qxd5 {Now I need to be careful. That queen has a lot of places to move to and can do some serious damage. But since I have the initiative, I might as well work with it.} 34. Bh7+ Kf7 35. Bg6+ {The rook is pinned, but swapping the rook for my bishop would not be good. I still have a deficit of pieces and the queen is protecting g8.} Ke6 {This is forced. Forking the king and  queen will help my desperate situation.} 36. Nf4+ {I consider myself very fortunate. The opponent is very strong and has a material advantage. But I had the initiative, the more mobile pieces and perhaps a better position.}
