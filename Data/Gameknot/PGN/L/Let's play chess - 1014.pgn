1. e3 {ok for an opening, I prefer to be more agressive, but thats just me!} e5 2. Qf3 {If you are going to bring the queen out early (which isn't advised) I prefer h5} Nf6 3. Bc4 {Fair enough, develops the bishop} Nc6 4. Qe2 {A rather negative move, probably better to open up summat else} Nb4 5. Kd1 {Especially if you had the winning line in mind again this was a negative move, b-b3 would probably have suited you better. Try not to move the king in the early stages unless you want to castle} d6 6. Bb3 {Should have done that last move} g6 7. Qc4 a5 {Well that was a really naff move from him....what would you have done if he had played nb-d5 or nf-d5? As it is he has made it easy for you.} 8. Qxf7# {Obvious and straightforward. Couple of hints....try to develop pieces. You saw in the latter half of our match that I was chasing you around a lot. true I was taking pieces but nowhere near mating you. It wasn't until I brought more material in I was able to get a mating position. Rem he who controls the middle 16 squares controls the game....get those bishops and knights moving!}
