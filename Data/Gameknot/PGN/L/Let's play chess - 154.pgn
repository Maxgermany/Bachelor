1. f4 {Bird's Opening.} Nh6 {Off the beaten path just a little with Ng6. Let's try taking White into the unfamiliar :-)} 2. Nf3 d5 {I like my chances with d5} 3. e3 {e3? Seems little unbird like} Nc6 4. Bb5 {Well we're no longer in Bird land. Actually think this move for White is giving Black a small advantage.} a6 5. Bxc6+ bxc6 6. O-O g6 7. h3 Bg7 8. c3 Nf5 9. Qe1 O-O {White's in a bit of trouble already.}
