1. e4 {This game demonstates what not to do as black  e4 my favortie first move as white} e5 {good book reply but my recent studies have shown c5 to be a little better but then again there is nothing wrong with e5 in fact I play that my self} 2. Nf3 {Still in book} d6 {I don't understand d6 here.  Nc6 is better or even d5  or c5 but d6 is too passive and in this case proved a mistake} 3. Bc4 {Standar book response to d6} f6 {huh?? f6} 4. d4 {I'm still in book for me} exd4 5. Qxd4 {Wouldn't have been able to to this if he has played Nc6 earlier} Nc6 {one move too late} 6. Qd5 {try to catch him napping} Nge7 {No Qd7 or Qe7 there} 7. Qf7+ {Bow to your partner(mate in 1)} Kd7 8. Be6# {Mate}
