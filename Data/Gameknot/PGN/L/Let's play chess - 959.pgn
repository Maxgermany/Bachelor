1. f4 {Bird's Opening.} Nf6 {Usually d5 to attempt to establish pawn center followed by this move.} 2. e3 {Supports f4 and continues Bird's Opening.} d5 {Helps to counter f4 and applies pressure in center especially on e4.} 3. d3 {Eases pressure on e4 and prevents option of a knight outpost on e4 later in game.} Nc6 {Helps to control center. Although I have seen c5 then this move afterwards.} 4. Nf3 {Helps apply pressure to the dark central squares which is an objective for the Bird's Opening.} Bg4 {Pins the knight and temporarily lessens its central threat. } 5. Be2 {Unleashes the pin and makes way to castle.} e6 {Supports d5 and gives the f8 bishop some options.} 6. O-O {A safe guard before attacking the queenside. } Bd6 {Develops the bishop while adding support to e5.} 7. a3 {Starts queenside attack.} O-O {Ideal.} 8. b4 {Continues queenside attack, prevents black bishop to c5, and allows Bb2 for white which gives white more control over the dark central squares.} a6 {Prevents b5.} 9. Nbd2 {Hoping for c4 next move and if black takes back, I take with my knight and have a temporary outpost on c4.} b5 {An effective move that halts my plans for the queenside for now.} 10. Bb2 {Fianchettoes the bishop and attacks the dark center squares. Also allows rook c1 which can help support pawn c4 afterwards.} a5 {Hoping to control b4.} 11. Nd4 {Attacks the pawn on b5, knight on c6, and bishop on g4.} Bxe2 {Naturally.} 12. Qxe2 {An obvious move that allows me to connect my rooks.} Nxd4 {Somewhat forced, I think.} 13. Bxd4 {Best way to recapture.} axb4 {Wanting to simplify the queenside while winning a pawn.} 14. axb4 {I oblige.} Bxb4 {There goes my queenside attack.} 15. Nb3 {Prevents c5 for now.} Be7 {Guards the knight so the black queen can move without worrying about my bishop taking on g6 and forcing him to disrupt his castled position to retake and doubling his pawns.} 16. Rxa8 {Forcing the queen to retake so I can play rook a1 and have control of the a file and some initiative attacking his queen.} Qxa8 {Forced.} 17. Ra1 {Attacks queen and gains control of the a-file.} Qb7 {With the possibility of rook a8 challenging my control on the a-file.} 18. Na5 {Continuing to attack the black queen.} Qa6 {Probably the best among other options.} 19. c4 {What I call 'randomness'. Was unsure of what to do.} c6 {It seems my opponent was too.} 20. cxb5 {Why not?} Qxb5 {I guess my opponent didn't want an isolated b-pawn.} 21. Qc2 {Attacks the c-pawn and allows my knight to retreat to b3 if need be.} Rc8 {Defends c-pawn and threatens c5 next move.} 22. Nb3 {Another defender for the c5 square along with the possibility 22...c5 23.Ra5 which wins the c5 pawn after the queen moves.} Nd7 {Preparing for the inevitable c5.} 23. Ra5 {Hoping to force a queen trade with 23...Qb4 24. Qc3 Qxc3 25. Bxc5  If queen b7, then rook a7 wins a piece.} Qb4 {As I hoped.} 24. Qc3 {Offering queen trade.} Qxc3 {My opponent accepts.} 25. Bxc3 {Obvious.} c5 {It was only a matter of time.} 26. Ra7 {Thinking I won a piece, but soon saw Rd8.} Rd8 {Alas, no free piece.} 27. Na5 {With the intention of Nc6.} Bf8 {A preventive measure.} 28. Nc6 {I go there anyways.} Rc8 {Offers knight trade.} 29. Rxd7 {I accept.} Rxc6 {Obvious.} 30. f5 {Trying to be disruptive. If exf5, then Rxd5.} c4 {Aggressive.} 31. dxc4 {Forced, in my opinion.} Rxc4 {Attacks my bishop.} 32. Bd4 {Locks in my bishop and really obstructs his center pawns.} Rc6 {A puzzling move.} 33. Rd8 {Pins the bishop and gives me an edge.} Rd6 {A blunder in my opinion.} 34. Rc8 {Whatever black does, I respond with Bc5 winning the bishop on f8 and more or less the game.}
