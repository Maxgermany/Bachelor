1. e4 c6 {Caro-Kann defence} 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 {Exchange variation} cxd5 4. c4 {Panov-Botvinnik Attack} Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. Nf3 Bb4 {Main line. Alternative is Be7} 7. Qa4+ {7. cxd5 Nxd5 is the main line giving the isolated queen's pawn common in the Panov-Botvinnik attack.} Nc6 8. Ne5 Bd7 9. Nxc6 Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 Bxc6 11. Qc2 O-O {A series of captures that seems to favour black. Black has developed all minor pieces and castled, white on the other hand is behind in development after moving the Queen twice and exchanging a Knight that moved three times for black's Knight that moved once. } 12. c5 {Maintains the pawn majority on the queen-side. The c4 square could be a useful outpost square for black's knight however} b6 13. cxb6 Qxb6 14. Rb1 Qc7 15. Bd3 Rab8 {Black seeks to take the open file for his own rook } 16. Bg5 {Threatens to remove the Knight defending h7 } Ne4 17. Bh4 {Gives the initiative to black with many attacking chances. Better maybe, 17. Bxe4 which removes the potentially strong black knight and creates a strong pawn on the c-file for white.} Rxb1+ 18. Qxb1 Nxc3 {? A mistake. Better was 18 ... Rb8 developing the rook to the open file with tempo or 18 ... Bb5 threatening 19 ... Qxc3 20. Ke2 Qd2+ forcing the white king to the wrong side of his defenders.} 19. Bxh7+ Kh8 20. Qc2 {? Only 20. Qb4 saves the position, attacking the knight and rook, after which white has a playable game. After 20. Qc2 the queen can be forced off the b1-h8 diagonal and the white bishop falls.} Ba4 21. Qd3 Rb8 {Better was 21 ... Qa5! with the discovered check Ne4+. The played move 21 ... Rb8 allows the skewer 22. Bg3 making the game very uncomfortable for black although still with the better position.} 22. Bg3 Qa5 {Better late than never, the queen moves to a5} 23. O-O {23. Qd2 is the only move. Removing the discovered check and attempting to exchange queens.} Bb5 {Skewering the rook through the queen.} 24. Qe3 Kxh7 25. Bxb8 Bxf1 26. Kxf1 {Better was 26. h3 giving the king space to escape the back rank away from the middle} Qb5+ {Forking the king and bishop} 27. Ke1 Qb1+ {Ignoring capturing the bishop for greater play elsewhere} 28. Kd2 Ne4+ 29. Ke2 Qxb8 30. Kf3 Qxh2 {And black resigns a lost position.}
