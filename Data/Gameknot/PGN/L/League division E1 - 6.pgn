1. e4 {standard white opening nothing Fancy here (i'm black by the way)} e5 {standard response by me} 2. f3 Be7 {the start of the king side castle} 3. g3 Nf6 {i keep moving toward castle} 4. d3 {my oppent keeps moving pawns?} O-O {king side castle complete} 5. Bg5 {threating to take my knight} Nc6 6. Bxf6 {He takes my knight taking out a potential future threat} Bxf6 {in return i take his bishop} 7. h4 Nd4 8. c3 {threating my knight} Ne6 {i retreat of course} 9. g4 {moves his pawn???} Nf4 {put my knight right back into the fray of things} 10. Qc2 c6 11. Nh3 {knight for knight maybe?} Bxh4+ {think i will put him in check instead :)  (better late than never)} 12. Kd1 {only real move he had} Qf6 13. Nf2 {trying to keep his knight alive maybe?} Bxf2 {i take the knight of course losing an active bishop} 14. Qxf2 {of course he takes the bishop} b6 15. Qh2 {threating mate with Qxh7} h6 {standard move on my part to stop mate} 16. Nd2 b5 17. b3 a5 18. Be2 b4 19. Qh5 {he moved his queen??? } bxc3 {i take his pawn (i decide not to take his queen, surely he will move his queen and lose the knight)} 20. Rc1 {where is he going with that move? } cxd2 {of course i take his knight, he resigned at this point (being down this far and losing either his queen or rook on the next move would be too much for anyone)}
