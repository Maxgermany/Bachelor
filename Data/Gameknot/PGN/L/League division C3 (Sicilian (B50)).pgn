1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bb5+ {this move does not even exist in the opening database... moving the bishop twice doesn't feel right; i don't really see the point in this move} Nc6 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Qc7 8. O-O a6 {asking the question} 9. Bxc6+ bxc6 {cool for me, 2 bishops} 10. Be3 c5 {developing with threat is always good... lsb does no longer exist to exploit the diagonal} 11. Nb3 Bb7 {again developing with threat, the pawn on e4 is my obvious target} 12. Qf3 Be7 {finish development} 13. Rfd1 O-O 14. a3 d5 {e5 fails for queen, exd5 gives chance of exd5, followed by d4 with the discovered queen attack; e4 looms anyway...} 15. Bf4 {preventing material loss with d4} e5 {claiming even more space with threat} 16. Bg5 d4 {and again, not only claiming space, but driving away the knight from defense of the weak e4-pawn} 17. Bxf6 {defending the pawn with the cost of the second bishop} Bxf6 18. Ne2 {now i have 2 bishops and a good space advantage, a passed pawn, everythings looks great} c4 {forcing the second knight to retreat} 19. Nd2 Qc6 {the idea here is to put further pressure on e4, if the knight on d4 has to move, there is a possible material win} 20. Ng3 {over-defending e4} Rfe8 {the e5-pawn is very important for me to keep space, so i thought its a good idea to give some protection} 21. Qg4 {ok, the threat here is knight h5 or f5, which could force an exchange with the loss of my bishop, which i did not like at this point} g6 {the knight can still access h5 or f5, but my dsb can retreat to g7 or even h8 and keep support for e5 and ultimately the h8-a1 diagonal} 22. Rab1 {propably eying on the b7 bishop a pawn push, at this point i do not care} Bg7 {denying g5 and f5 to the knight and therefore prventing expansion} 23. Qe2 {eying c4} Rac8 {defends e4} 24. Nf3 {e5 is well protected and g5 is useless at this point, so i don't care} h5 {gains space and stops possible h2-push} 25. Rde1 {this is the first sign of lackings space, so there is no real counter play} Bh6 {a perfect position, the bishop can hardly become stronger} 26. Ref1 {waiting for a strike... my only chess book says: there is no need to hurry, if you have space, just squeeze to death: my plan here is to gain more space and enhance the minor pieces; my bishop is clearly superior to the knights... in my opinion, white has to sacrifice some material here to do not get crushed} a5 {the idea is to make place for the bishop because queen an rook are on diagonal and after Ba6, c3 is a serious threat} 27. Rfe1 Ba6 {even if the rook is not there any more, the position for the bishop is perfect} 28. Qd1 Bb5 {c2 seems to be the week point, so the bishop tries to penetrate deeper into the position} 29. Rf1 c3 30. Re1 cxb2 31. Rxb2 {ok, now this opened the b-file and gives some activity to the white rook, but i hardly see any counter-play, but the c2-pawn is a big target right now} Ba4 32. Re2 {like a tank in a forest...} Qc3 {rook hangs and has to retreat} 33. Ra2 Rcd8 {ok, here i got lazy, perhaps i played under the influence :) ... i did not see this  (plan here was to push the d-pawn)} 34. Qd3 Qc6 {try to keep the fat lady enclosed, no way out and Bb5 is a threat} 35. Rb2 Rdc8 {pressuring c2 again...} 36. Ne1 {protecting, but the rook doesn't go anywhere from here, threat for me here is f-pawn push, so i have to do something...} Rcb8 {with lack of space, exchanging theoretically favors the enclosed in player, but here, this exchange removes the most active white piece} 37. Rxb8 Rxb8 38. Qd1 {defending against Bb5} Rb2 {Rook is strong on the 7th rank} 39. Qa1 Qc3 {defending my rook} 40. Nf1 {the clumsy horse tries to move in for defense, but it is too late} Bb5 {till now, no material is lost :)} 41. Qd1 {moving in for defense} Ra2 {again no need to hurry, not only the rook has nowhere to go...} 42. Nd3 Ra1 {this ends the ride, the game was resigned here}
