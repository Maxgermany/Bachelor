1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez} a6 4. Ba4 d6 {The Deferred Steinitz variation} 5. d4 {Immediately playing for the centre} b5 6. Bb3 exd4 7. Nxd4 Ne5 {?! - Better would have been to follow general principles and develop another piece} 8. O-O Nf6 9. Re1 Be7 10. Nd2 Bg4 11. Nd4f3 Nxf3+ 12. Nxf3 O-O 13. h3 {To see if Black will maintain the pin or give White the Bishop pair.  A luft for the King is also useful} Bh5 14. Bf4 {Continuing development} Bg6 15. e5 Ne8 16. e6 {I thought that exchanging on d6 was better for Black as he could place his knight on a better square (d6).  If Black had captured on e6 with fxe6 then his kingside is weakened which may allow for tatics later in the game} h6 17. Qe2 {Now fxe6 would be a mistake after Qxe6+ followed by Qxe7 winning a piece} f6 18. Rad1 {White's pieces are centralised and at this juncture looks to have the better position} Ra7 19. Bd5 {The start of a mis-guided plan but fortunately no lasting harm comes of it} c5 20. c3 Nc7 21. Bb3 c4 22. Bc2 Bxc2 23. Qxc2 a5 {Here I was calculating lines after the Bishop sacrifice; Bxh6.  I could see a forced draw if Black accepted and thought I could always fall back on this if an attack was not forthcoming} 24. Bxh6 gxh6 25. Qg6+ Kh8 26. Qxh6+ Kg8 27. Qg6+ {And now to find a way of exploiting the relative weakness of Black's King} Kh8 28. Rd4 f5 {Defending the h4 square} 29. Ne5 {The d6 pawn is pinned and a check on f7 beckons} Qe8 30. Nf7+ {White has two pawns for the piece and will now win the exchange} Rxf7 31. exf7 Qf8 32. Rxe7 {If 32. ...Qxe7 then 33. Rh4#} Qg7 {Black resigns.  (33. Rh4+ and mate to follow)}
