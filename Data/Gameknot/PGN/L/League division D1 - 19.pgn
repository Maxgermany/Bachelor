1. e4 Nf6 {A perfectly sound opening for black, but only seventh in GK's World Database after 1...c5, 1...e5, 1...e6, 1...c6, 1...d6, 1...g6, and 1...d5} 2. e5 {The main line and only real choice for white to hope to maintain an edge.} Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 {Eschewing the modern variation of 4. Nf3 which ranks higher in popularity currently. } Nb6 5. exd6 exd6 6. Nc3 Be7 {Still all within theory and fairly main lines, black looks to castle and complete development} 7. h3 {A fairly common prophylactic move in this position, denying black the pesky g4 square for his bishop. } Nc6 {More common is O-O first. } 8. Nf3 O-O 9. Bd3 Bf6 {An odd move, twice moving the black bishop before completing the development of the LSB, however this move does have basis in the DB (10 games with a 70%/20%/10% win/loss/draw for White). Adding pressure to d4, but no immediate threat due to 10... Nd4 11.Nd4 Bd4 12. Bh7+ Kh7 13. Qd4  The bishop in this case will be fianchettoed onto g7 while black decides what to do with the LSB. } 10. O-O Bd7 {Here we leave the world DB with 8 games of 10... Re8 being the main move. This bishop is oddly placed on d7 and doesn't exert much pressure. The early Nc6 allowed Bd3 which robbed black of the f5 square. } 11. b3 {A common maneuver in the ...Bf6 line. } Re8 12. Bb2 g6 13. Ne4 Bg7 14. Rb1 Nb4 15. a3 {At the time I didn't mind allowing the exchange on d3 since the threat on h7 had been neutralized and recapturing with the queen would aid White, but missed that the bishop had another purpose...} Nxd3 16. Qxd3 Bf5 {...of helping to pressure f5. Things are about to get dicey for White. } 17. Rfe1 {Nfd2 is also available. } d5 18. cxd5 Nxd5 {Recapturing with the queen is slightly better, although White is still in some trouble. } 19. Ne5 Nf4 {This move puts black back on equal terms as it allows White to attack the knight while undoing the pin and adding pressure to the king-side. 19... Nf6 20. Nf6+ Qf6 removing many of White's knight threats and kindside pressure is much better for black. } 20. Qf3 Ne6 {20... Qh4 protecting the knight and pressure White's kingside in return leaves black equal while White garners a small edge with this move. } 21. Rbd1 {Controlling the center and supporting the pawn. } Bxe4 {?? A crushing error that gives White a furious attack after...} 22. Qxf7+ {!} Kh8 23. Rxe4 {?? Equal or a small edge for white but missing the forceful continuation after 23. d5! Pressing the attack by opening lines for the bishop, allowing for all kinds of tactics for White.   At the time was looking for the knight sac on g6 and a mate with the rook on the h-file but missed the saving move by stopping one move short in the continuation..} Ng5 24. Nxg6+ hxg6 25. Rh4+ Nh7 26. d5 Rg8 27. Rdd4 Qf6 {The saving move I had missed before. } 28. Qxc7 {With nothing better I clear the way for the pawn. If the queen leaves the defense of h4 I'm ready to pounce...} Raf8 {Adding pressure to the kingside} 29. Rdf4 Qxb2 {?? The losing blunder, black must maintain defense of h4} 30. Rxh7+ {I spot this one at least. Black resigns due to 30... Kh7 Rh4#  Hope you enjoy the game, comments are more than welcome :) }
