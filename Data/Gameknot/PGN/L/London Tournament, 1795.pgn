1. e4 e5 2. f4 {Atwood ventures a King's Gambit.} exf4 {As a man of honor, Philidor accepts.} 3. Nf3 {A sure way to prevent a Black counterattack of ...Q-R5 ch, always a danger in the King's Gambit.} g5 {Philidor supports the advanced Pawn.} 4. Bc4 {Naturally, Atwood goes after the weakness at KB7.} g4 {Philidor counterattacks with verve.} 5. d4 {Opening more attacking lines...} gxf3 {...but sacrificing a whole piece.} 6. Qxf3 {Bringing out the heavy artillery.} Nc6 {Philidor hastens to begin his own development and consolidate his position.} 7. c3 {Securely guarding the QP.} Qf6 {Adding a defender to the KB2 square.} 8. e5 {Thrusting forward in the center.} Qxe5+ {Countering with a check.} 9. Kd1 {I must be missing something here. Why is 9 PxQ a bad move? I can't imagine Atwood overlooking it, or Philidor missing it when he played his previous move.} Qf6 {Having forced Atwood's King to move, the Queen retreats.} 10. Re1+ {Down a piece and a Pawn, Atwood must attack.} Be7 {Philidor cuts him off at the pass.} 11. Bxf4 {Winning back the Pawn.} d6 {Enabling the QB to move folowed by O-O-O. With his attack gone and down a piece without compensation, Atwood resigns.}
