1. e4 {This game was originally a Sicilian, in which I made an early decision (move 12) to go for an endgame.   This style of play is unusual for me, and outside my comfort zone. In the end the game was won,  and was won in exactly the way I envisaged.  But this is not to say that I forced this outcome. I would welcome comments from more experienced players about the idea itself and the implementation. } c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Bd3 {I have been playing the Open Sicilian all my life, and still haven't figured out what to do with this move.} Nc6 {Pressurizing the d4 knight seemed a good start.} 6. Nb3 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Bd2 a6 {To make white pay for not playing the Maroczy Bind.} 9. O-O b5 10. a3 {Gameknot's computer didn't like this move, suggesting 10. a4.  Certainly in the end lack of space was one of white's problems.} O-O 11. Rb1 Be6 {Planning to exchange on b3, doubling white's pawns.  Otherwise white has to withdraw the knight to c1, which doesn't look good in an already passive position.} 12. Ne2 Bxb3 {So now I am going for an endgame, in which I hope my pawn structure will give me an advantage.  The downside, of course, is that white has the bishop pair.} 13. cxb3 d5 14. exd5 Qxd5 {Hoping to give white the choice of multiple exchanges or making further concessions.} 15. Bc3 Rfd8 16. Bc2 {White seems happy to go for the exchanges. Maybe my play was not sound here, as the side that controls more space shouldn't normally be exchanging.} a5 17. Qxd5 Rxd5 18. Rfd1 Rad8 {I wanted to be the one in control of the d-file when the exchanges had finished.} 19. Rxd5 Rxd5 20. g3 b4 {To fix the Q-side pawns, and also drive the bishop off the long diagonal.  (I am still, after all, playing a kind of Dragon.)} 21. Be1 e5 22. Kf1 {White's king stealing a march; this would cause me some concern later.} Bf8 {Trying to force white to fix the pawn structure.} 23. a4 {Gameknot didn't like this, recommending the exchange ab.  I was also worried about the white rook appearing on the open a-file.} Nd4 24. Nxd4 Rxd4 25. Rd1 Bc5 {I wanted exchanges to be on my terms. Now Rxd4 would lose the b2 pawn. } 26. f3 Nd7 {Expecting to move into an endgame, I wanted my knight to occupy a post on c5 to create a barrier against white's king.} 27. Bf2 {So here come the exchanges} Rxd1+ 28. Bxd1 Bxf2 {No Dragon player likes giving up this bishop, but the important thing is that it wrecks white's bishop pair.} 29. Kxf2 Nc5 {Now I have a knight against bishop endgame, with a slight pawn advantage.   I should say here that I usually much prefer to be the guy with the bishop. Knights, for me, are agents of chaos, to be feared rather than trusted.   That said, white's bishop doesn't look great, and I had chances to make it even worse.} 30. Ke3 {I was concerned that white's king looks more active than mine, but my knight is preventing it going anywhere.} f5 {To reinforce the central blockade and looking to mobilize my central pawn majority.  However Gameknot did not like this move, recommending Kg7.  } 31. Bc2 {White here is missing an opportunity to improve his bishop, by Be2-c4.  I can't take on b3 as long as my king is on the light diagonal. } Kf7 {The quickest route to the centre,  but it might have been better to move along the dark squares.} 32. h3 h6 {White seems to be attempting a pawn advance, but there is no chance of a breakthrough, and this will just enable me to fix the K-side pawns too on the wrong colour squares for white's bishop.} 33. h4 Ke6 34. g4 {The g6 pawn is hanging, but I have a check.} f4+ 35. Ke2 {Now at last my king is more active than white's. } g5 {Fixing the pawns. } 36. hxg5 hxg5 {So now I have to force d5.  Up to now I have been trying to keep the gap in the centre small enough to stop white advancing;  now the question is whether it is big enough to give me room for an attack.} 37. Kd2 Kd5 {If white's bishop was better placed, I couldn't have come through here.} 38. Ke2 Kd4 39. Kd2 e4 {Finally I will have a passed pawn. } 40. fxe4 Nxe4+ 41. Ke2 {Exchanging the pieces would lose.} Nc5 {Heading for e5, depending on white's moves.} 42. Kf3 {Gameknot doesn't comment on this move, but it seemed to me a serious mistake,  letting go of d3.} Nd3 43. Ke2 {It is too late for white to challenge for d3 now.} f3+ {White cannot take the pawn because of Ne1+.  His king is forced back to the back rank.} 44. Kf1 Ke3 45. Bb1 Nf2 {Many threats here, but the immediate threat to the pawn forces Bf5. The bishop will not be able to cover the queening square. } 46. Bf5 Ne4 {Now ...Ng3+ or ...Nd2+  and the pawn will queen.}
