1. e3 {meek way to start, e4 is more normal} e5 {good move, controls the center, and opens lines for your bishop and queen} 2. Bc4 {simple developing move} Nc6 {good, the "rule" is to develop knights before bishops, and it helps control the center} 3. Nc3 {development} f6 {first move I have a problem with, moving your pawn to f6 weakens the h5-e8 diagonal against your king, and does not promote the development of the rest of your army} 4. Nf3 Bc5 {ok} 5. Ne2 {first move of naregon's I don't appreciate, as you normally shouldn't move the same piece twice in the opening, and this move doesn't appear to accomplish anything} Nge7 {good developing move, pawn to d5 was also good (attacking the bishop and controlling the center at the same time while opening the diagonal for your light squared bishop} 6. b3 {I think pushing the pawn to d4 was better} Nf5 {same rule, don't move the same piece twice in the opening if you can avoid it, 6...d5 was certainly better, followed by castling.  Also ask yourself what is my piece doing there?  What are you trying to accomplish?  You need the rest of your army developed before you even consider trying to attack} 7. O-O Nb4 {d5 would also have been good here, and neither of your knights are making any threats, they're just sitting there waiting to be attacked and makes it easier for his pawns to advance e.g.          8. a3...Nc6  9. b4...Bb6 and he's pushing you around} 8. c3 Nd3 {simply loses a knight for free...} 9. Bxd3 g6 {I think 9...d5 was still better, letting the bishop protect the knight and threatening to fork his pieces with 10...e4 if he doesn't react} 10. b4 Bb6 11. Ng3 {threatening to win a pawn with 12. Nxf5...gxf5  13. Bxf5} d5 {finally!  and threatens 12...e4} 12. Bb5+ c6 {excellent, fortifies your center and attacks the bishop} 13. Nxf5 gxf5 {I think Bxf5 is better, to get your bishop active along the b1-h7 diagonal and keeps your pawn structure intact, and as you see later in the game that naregon uses the e8-h5 diagonal to great effect  } 14. Ba3 {pointless move, and loses the bishop on b5} e4 {taking the bishop right away was stronger, pushing the pawn to e4 let's him place his knight nicely on d4} 15. Nh4 {which he doesn't take advantage of...} h5 {stops the annoying Qh5 , but taking the bishop was still better} 16. Ng6 Rg8 {ok, but leaves Qxh5 as an option for him} 17. Be2 {probably better than Qxh5} Rxg6 {best} 18. Bxh5 {pinning the rook, only one way to save it} Be6 {and that's not it, 18...Kf7 protects the rook, so that even if he takes, you at least get the bishop} 19. Bxg6+ {ouch...} Kf8 {19...Kd7 was safer, now his queen comes in, and your king is uncomfortably placed on the a3 bishop's diagonal} 20. Qh5 Rc8 21. d4 {if 21. b5 , 21...c5 holds things together, but being down a rook and a pawn is never a good sign} a5 {now you're just asking for more trouble} 22. bxa5+ Kg7 {walks into mate...  but not a whole lot else you could do} 23. Qh7# {}
