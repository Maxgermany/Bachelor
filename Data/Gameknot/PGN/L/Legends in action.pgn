[Opening "QGD (D52), Cambridge Springs defence, Argentine variation"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Queen's gambit opening. White intends to lure Black into accepting the c-pawn thus exchanging a wing pawn for a central pawn. Later White will play e4 and possess a strong center.} e6 {Queen's gambit declined.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. e3 c6 6. Nf3 Qa5 {Cambridge Springs Defense (or less commonly, the Pillsbury Variation) is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined. Black breaks the pin  on the h4-d8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3 knight (exploiting the absence of the queen's bishop from the queen side). If Black later plays dxc4, there may be threats against the g5 bishop. The first recorded instance of this opening was played by Emanuel Lasker in 1892. The name derives from a 1904 tournament in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania in which the defense was used several times. Practitioners of the opening have included Efim Bogoljubov, Vasily Smyslov, and Garry Kasparov.  The line remains popular among amateurs because there are several traps White must avoid.} 7. Nd2 {Present theory suggests, 7...Rc1 continuing development.} Bb4 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Bh4 {White takes the bishop out of the X-ray attack of Black's queen. This is one of the traps of Cambridge Springs defense.} c5 10. Nb3 Qa4 11. Bxf6 Nxf6 12. dxc5 Ne4 {Black is exchanging pieces to relieve his cramped position.} 13. cxd5 Bxc3+ 14. bxc3 Nxc5 15. Rd1 exd5 16. Rxd5 Nxb3 17. axb3 {Black has solved his opening problems by exchanging pieces and his c8 bishop can develop freely. The opening phase is over and White has the advantage of central pawn majority and his Rooks and Queen are better placed than Black's pieces. White King has not castled as yet.} Qc6 18. Rd4 Re8 19. Bd3 {Capablanca is dominating the centre.} Qxg2 20. Bxh7+ Kf8 21. Be4 Qh3 22. Qd2 {Probably a slight inaccuracy. 22.Qd3 would have been better.} Be6 23. c4 a5 {Capa is one pawn plus and let us see how he exploits this tiny advantage.} 24. Rg1 {Did Capa miss taking the b7 pawn? It was en prise. Let us look at the following variation: 24. Bxb7 Rab8 25. Bc6 Rxb3 26. Qd1 Rb6 27. Bxe8 Qg2 28. Rf1 Bh3 29. Kd2 Qxf1 30. Qxf1 Bxf1 31. Bb5 would be enough to win.} Qxh2 {Alekhine may be be happy that material is equal now.} 25. Rh1 Qc7 {Suddenly White is attacking on the flank.} 26. Qb2 Qc5 27. Bd5 Ra6 28. Re4 {White Rook moves out of the way to open the diagonal for White queen which is now threatening the g7 pawn. Capa has reached a won position by delicately maneuvering his pieces. Now we understand why Capablanca did not take the b7 pawn. This position is far more advantageous than taking the pawn. } Rd6 29. Rh7 Ke7 30. Qxg7 Kd8 31. Bxe6 fxe6 {Look at the 7th rank domination by White's Queen and Rook. Black can resign now.   We can see the logical flow in this game. In the opening, aim is to control the center. In the middle game, aim is to dominate the center and open lines to attack the opponent's King. In the end, dominate the 7th rank. Looks like a text book game. My guess is many Chess principles of today were authored after studying Steinitz, Lasker and Capablanca's games.} 32. Qxb7 Qb4+ 33. Qxb4 axb4 34. c5 {A pawn move threatening Black's Rook on d6. The hidden motive is to switch White's Rook on e4 to the b-file.} Rc6 35. Rxb4 Rxc5 36. Ra7 {Alekhine resigns. The simplicity of this game is amazing. A powerful, attacking, all time great player like Alekhine is reduced to a spectator. }
