1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. exd5 Nxd5 4. Nxd5 Qxd5 {This time with Alekhine's Defence. Black programmed these moves as responses to mine.} 5. Qf3 {I decide to bring out my queen, hoping that Black will agree to exchange, so my knight will emerge onto f3...} Qxf3 6. Nxf3 {...and Black agrees.} Bg4 7. Ne5 {The idea to attack Black's bishop, after attacking my knight, came courtesy of a previous annotated game of mine, where that suggestion was made...} Be6 8. Bc4 {...and I do the same thing here, with my own bishop, also eyeing up the pawn on f7. Black's bishop is pinned to that pawn, as it is preventing the pawn in front of the king from being isolated.} Bxc4 9. Nxc4 {This *may* not have been such a good trade for me, as my knight is probably not in the best position, as 9... b5 can harass it, although the best square it could retreat to, if necessary, is e3.} Nc6 10. O-O O-O-O 11. c3 {I moved up the pawn in front of my remaining bishop, to prevent Black's knight from camping on b4 or d4, and to allow my kingside rook the e1 square, without any danger from my rooks being forked.} e5 12. Re1 f6 {I was eyeing up Black's king's pawn, but he's now covered it. Also, my queen's pawn has become backward, as 13. d3 would be met with 13... Rxd3, and 13. d4 would result in 13... exd4, and even if I captured, Black would take back, to take two of my pawns for the price of one.} 13. b3 g6 14. Rd1 {I placed my rook behind my pawn, so I could trade bishops on a3, without losing my pawn.} Bh6 {But as Black got out his bishop from the other side, he may be hoping to spring a surprise for me, however my pawn is now covered by my rook.} 15. Nb2 {With Black getting his bishop out, the knight retreat covers d3, which proves to be useful a few moves later...} Rd7 {...as Black is obviously trying to increase the pressure on my pawn. He's obviously thinking of doubling on the d-file...} 16. d3 Bxc1 17. Raxc1 {...and this bishop trade was probably better for me, as it connects my own rooks, and allows my queenside one more room to manoeuvre.} Rhd8 {I was proved right here, but so far the protection on the pawn is sufficient enough...} 18. Rc2 e4 {...but this is no longer the case, as although I *could* play 19. d4, that pawn could come under later threat, and Black could deal with the threat to his advanced pawn with f5, should I play f3...} 19. Rcd2 {... so I double up behind my pawn to give it some extra cover. I had programmed the following: 19... exd3 20. Rxd3 Rxd3 21. Rxd3 Rxd3 22. Nxd3, to go in for the knight ending...} f5 {...but with this move, Black must be trying to induce more pressure with his knight...} 20. Kf1 Ne5 {...again guessed correctly by me...} 21. Ke2 {...which gave my king a wake-up call. However, if the quadruple exchange is done, my king will be further into the fray...} exd3+ 22. Nxd3 Nxd3 23. Rd2xd3 Rd7xd3 24. Rxd3 c5 {...but I'm slightly amazed Balck advanced a pawn here, instead of exchanging the second pair of rooks, or try to keep them on.} 25. Rxd8+ Kxd8 {So I felt it was prudent to remove Black's last remaining piece, in exchange for mine, so my king can advance up the board, hoping to hunt down Black's pawns, that is, the "hunted" becomes a "hunter", as he will have more space.} 26. Kd3 {It was a 50/50 decision to place my king on d3 or e3, but I felt d3 was better, because the pawn on c5 was not yet covered.} Kd7 27. f4 {I felt it was best here to prevent Black's king from getting to my kingide pawns easily, so, provisionally, he would have to go via the h-file...} h6 28. h4 {...and now I've made Black's KNP backward, as 28...g5 would allow me to take two for the price of one. And my own king would be able to attack the other kingside pawn.} b5 {Now Black's cut off any chance my king had of getting through on the queenside...} 29. a3 {...but I can have a stronger hold on b4, making Black's QNP backward.} Kd6 {With Black's king advancing forwards again...} 30. c4 {...as I felt this move here would allow me to create an outside passed pawn, or weaken Black's queenside, although 30... b4 would put up more of a fight. I may have played 31. axb4 in reply to that particular move, with Black playing 31... cxb4 still giving me that possibility, although my king would have to stay near the queenside, with 31. a4 leading to a probable draw...} a6 31. cxb5 axb5 32. a4 {...but this may have been an error of judgement here. Black could play 32... c4+, and then his pawns could round up mine, or he'd have an outside passed pawn and allow his king to get nearer to the kingside...} bxa4 {...but he obviously panicked here.} 33. bxa4 {Now we both have an isolated passed queenside pawn, but *mine* is on the outside, so it can allow my king to get closer to the kingside, as Black's would have to go further to eliminate my passed pawn.} Kc6 34. Kc4 Kb6 35. g3 {This move here allowed me to keep my queenside pawn for one more move.} Ka5 36. Kxc5 Kxa4 37. Kd6 {And now, in what has been a very even game throughout, I'm about to win, with my king three files ahead...} Kb3 38. Ke6 Kc3 39. Kf6 {...and Black resigned here, knowing he couldn't stop all my pawns, as he pointed out in his resignation note.}
