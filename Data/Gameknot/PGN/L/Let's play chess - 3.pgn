1. e4 {When I first annotated this game, I only wrote my thoughts during the game. However, I believe that everyone reading this annotation deserves to know the truth, so I am also posting some analysis by Fritz 9. Unsurprisingly, Fritz often proves my calculations wrong...} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nf5 {Setting up a little trap} d6 {if 5..Ne7 instead, 6.Nd6#. But black is too careful to fall into this trap} 6. Bc4 Nf6 7. Bg5 Bxf5 8. exf5 Qb6 9. b3 {According to Fritz, 9.Bxf6 was better} Ne4 {threatening both the bishop and checkmate; this is not the best move, black misses here 9..d5 and white cannot respond to this with 10.Bxd5 because of 10..Qa5  and 11..Qxd5} 10. Be3 {the only move, I thought at the moment. I missed the less-than-obvious-for-me 10.Bxf7+  Kxf7 11.Qd5+  and 12.Qxe4, where white is a clear pawn up and has a better position} Qc7 {according to Fritz, 10..Qa5  was better} 11. O-O g6 12. fxg6 {white plans 13.Qf3, so this move ensures that 13..Nf6 is not possible. The knight will have to go to c5 then. } hxg6 {the h-column is starting to look dangerous for white. But, as the future will show, this is a game in which white attacks, not defends. I think...} 13. Qf3 {I've got my own plans with f6, so you move your ass to c5. Of course, I overlooked 13..f5, which keeps the knight at e4. Fortunately, my opponent also missed the move, which is clearly better than..} Nc5 14. Nc3 {planning 15. Nd5 with tempo and 16. Nf6  (if black plays carelessly 15..Qd7, tant mieux :)} e4 {why is black giving away a pawn? Again, 14..f5 was better} 15. Nxe4 {Dunno, but I'm taking it. Well, Fritz says 15.Nd5 was way better} d5 {That's why: now white has both bishop and knight en prise. Not to mention the mate threat at h7. Told you the h column was dangerous...} 16. Nf6+ {We're gonna save the horsey...  Although it looked dangerous for white, black is way behind. The evaluation by Fritz is already  8!} Kd8 {Of course, NOT 16..Ke7, because of 17. Nxd5 , winning the queen} 17. Qxd5+ {We're gonna save the bishop too, removing that nasty pawn. Fritz thinks that 17.Bf4 was much better than this check} Kc8 {Not, 17..Ke7, when white has a number of advantage-gaining moves (like 18.Qxf7 )} 18. g3 {Let's not forget that white is still under mate threat. But for this, the c5 knight looks tasty.. 18.h3 or 18.f4 were other good moves in this situation} Ne6 {The knight goes to e6 to protect both himself and f7} 19. Qxe6+ {A daunting or perhaps reckless move. If I don't win, at least I'm going down in flames. Well, at least Fritz likes the queen sacrifice, giving it a  3.5 evaluation. Close behind in Fritz's list is 19.Rad1} fxe6 {An offer you can't possibly refuse. Besides, any other move loses almost instantly: 19..Kb8 is met by 20.Nd7  and 19..Kd8 by 20. Rad1} 20. Bxe6+ {The follow-up} Kd8 {20..Kb8 would've been followed by 21. Nd7  and a discovered check to follow} 21. Rad1+ {Bringing as many pieces in action as possible. If white does not maintain pressure, the sacrifice is not justified.} Bd6 {21..Ke7 loses to 22.Nd5  Kxe6 23.Nxc7  and 24.Nxa8} 22. Bc5 {The bishop seems lost. White begins to recover material. Actually, Fritz likes 22.Bf4 better} Ke7 {Protecting the bishop, but allowing 2 family forks. Perhaps this was not the best move here? Well, it really was the best according to Fritz} 23. Nd5+ {The alternative was 23.Bxd6 , also winning the queen. A move surely worth investigating, but at the time Nd5  looked better. Hmmm, still does. Of course, Fritz likes the bishop move better. Grrrr..} Kxe6 24. Rfe1+ {A intermediary move, bringing the second rook in action before taking the queen. Now all of white's pieces are active, while both of black's rooks are still in the corner. Well, at least the h8 one looks threatening.} Kf5 {of course, not 24..Kf7, because of 25.Nxc7 Bxc7 16.Rd7 , winning the bishop} 25. Nxc7 {Return of investment} Bxc7 {after this move, the evaluation by Fritz is  0.01} 26. Rd7 {Maintaing the pressure and preparing the next move} Rac8 {Another option (better or worse?) was 26..Ba5} 27. Rf7+ {White hopes to eventually weave a mating net. For now, it's all hopes and laying traps} Kg5 {NOT 27..Kg4, which loses to 28.Re4  Kg5 29.Be3  Kh5 30.Rh4# or 28..Kh5 29.Rh4  Kg5 30. Be3  Bf4 31.Bxf4#  Actually, Fritz prefers 27..Kg4, where black responds to 28.Re4  with Kh3 and black looks fine (evaluation:  0.6)} 28. Be3+ {Keep on checking... 28.Re4 was far better} Kh5 {I think there was a mate in the case of 28..Kg4, but I can't seem to find it now. Wait, it's something like 29.f3  Kh5 30.g4  Kh4 31.Bf2  Kg5 32.h4  and black has to either give rook for pawn and bishop or continue with 32..Kh6 33.Be3  g5 34.Bxg5  Kg6 35.Rf6 ... So it's not really a mate, but it's not really a joyride either. Actually, after 28..Kg4 29.f3  Kh3, black is fine. Another miscalculation by white....} 29. Kg2 {Preparing a later f3 or h3} a6 {Not really the best move. Kingside is where the action is} 30. Rd1 {Preparing 31.Rd5+ , when black has to sacrifice a piece at e5} Rhd8 {Black refuses to fall into this trap and protects the d-column. Actually, this was a bad move, but I didn't profit from it} 31. h3 {White can mate with bishop and one rook, so the d-rook is expendable in view of 32.Rh7# The best move here is 31. g4 , which mates black ten moves later. But I can't see that far, so I settled for a more straightforward mate threat} g5 {Black stubbornly refuses to be tricked} 32. Rf6 {another mate threat: 32..Rxd1 33.g4  Kh4 34. Rh6#} Rdh8 {of course, not 32..g4, because of 33.Rh6#} 33. g4+ {caught in the net. It's checkmate in 6 starting with this move} Kh4 {only move} 34. f3 {preparing 35.Bf2# This is the fastest checkmate} Bb6 {Desperate situations call for desperate moves. The game is lost, but another option to avoid immediate checkmate was 34..Bg3 35.Rg6 Rh5, losing the rook } 35. Bxb6 {continuing to gain material, but it is a bad move. 35.Rdd6 mates faster} Nd4 {another sacrifice in order to stop the mate} 36. Bxd4 {still gaining material and threatening mate. Again, this is not the best move. It appears I still can't see the best lines.} Rxc2+ {only move} 37. Bf2+ {check after check} Rxf2+ {again, the only move} 38. Kxf2 a5 {not 38..Kxh3 39.Rh1#} 39. Rdd6 {another mate threat} Rh5 {the knot is tightening around the king's neck, and this is the last hope} 40. Rfh6 {checkmate in one, and black resigns}
