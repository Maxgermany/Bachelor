1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Bxd5 Bb4+ {If I was going to take the bishop with my queen, I should have done it here, instead.  Really, though, I shouldn't have done it at all.} 7. Nc3 Qxd5 {I thought I was so clever, his knight being pinned, but my bishop was just too close to his pawns, I couldn't maintain, and should have seen that in the first place.  It was at this point I lost my queen.} 8. d4 exd4 9. a3 Ba5 10. b4 Bb6 11. Nxd5 {Ok, so at this point, I freaked out, and instead of protecting my pieces, I, um... I dunno.  } O-O 12. Nxb6 Re8+ {This move turned out to be a crucial one, but I don't think I realized it at the time.  I think I was just trying to take back the rhythm of the game.  } 13. Kf1 Be6 {I don't think I even realized that my rook might be taken.  } 14. Nxa8 {after this move (14), I saw a potential winning scenario, made a comment to myself on what it would be so I would remember it, and watched to see if he would follow what I thought he would do.  The next four moves were exactly as I predicted.  I was way behind at this point, and so I don't know if I was lucky, or good.} Bc4+ 15. Kg1 Be2 16. Qd2 Ne5 17. Qxe2 Nxf3+ 18. Qxf3 Re1# {}
