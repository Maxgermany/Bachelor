[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 {with the goal of getting to d4. 16...Bf2 was the other option. The dark-squared bishop is needed to help the passed e-pawn go further up the board. White king is now in a very precarious position.  } e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Qf3 Nc6 4. c3 Bc5 5. Qg3 O-O {It is normally quite bad to move a piece twice in the opening, especially the Queen. The castling aids development and protects the g7-pawn under threat.} 6. Nf3 Nxe4 {Capturing a pawn that is unprotected by anything. Also directly threatening the White Queen. White still has Q-side Knight and Bishop undeveloped. } 7. Qg4 d5 {Continues the pressure on White queen. Also threatens the White Bishop on c4, and protects the Black Knight on e4.} 8. Qh4 Qxh4 {and I gain a knight from this mini exchange. White must capture the Queen and that leaves the way open for a Bishop check fork 9...Bxf2+} 9. Nxh4 Bxf2+ 10. Kf1 Bxh4 11. Bxd5 {as predicted} Bf5 {Originally planning 11...Ng5 or 11...Nf6 I felt 11...Bf5 was better as it brought a piece into the action, connected the rooks and protects the vulnerable knight on e4.} 12. Ke2 Rad8 {I don't understand why White wasn't aiming to bring the bishop and knight into action. Anyway, I ignored that and brought out a rook to threaten the bishop and gain control of the d-file. My development is nearly complete. Because I'm currently up in material, I am going to aim for a knight sacrifice on d4 to bring the e-pawn onto the d-file so that it is supported by the rook, and then eventually get rid of the d-pawn by moving the bishop to g5.} 13. d3 {threatens the knight and frees up the d2-h6 diagonal for the bishop.} Nc5 {A nice escape square which continues the pressure and opens the way for my light-squared bishop. Anticipating c4 which will open up the way for the as-yet undeveloped knight and protect the isolated bishop on d5, I will then check the king with the bishop before removing the knight before it can take part in the action. } 14. c4 {And this time the predict-a-move ploy works!} Bxd3+ 15. Kf3 {Aaaaargh the temptation the temptation. If I still can't think of anything else at the end of the day. I will take the knight, but otherwise I must find the best way to keep the king in check.} e4+ 16. Kg4 Bf6 {with the goal of getting to d4. 16...Bf2 was the other option.} 17. Rf1 {?? Dear oh dear... what was white thinking here?} Bxf1 18. g3 Ne5+ 19. Kf4 Rfe8 {Bringing the inactive rook into play. Even if Bxf7+ there is enough protection not to worry about it.}
