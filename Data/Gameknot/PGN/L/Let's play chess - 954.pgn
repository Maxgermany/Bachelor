Bxf7+ {thats why- he takes the bishop and i will check with my knight on g-5 and then my q will take his bishop on g-4.  ALTHOUGH, others have pointed out - see comments- that  ...KxB,    >N g5 , QxN,  > f4 x Q,  Bx Q and white is a piece down   } Kd7 6.

Kg2 Bh4 22. d4 {desperately trying to get my pieces out} Rf2+ {now my troubles start} 23. Kg1 Bg3 {boxed in} 24. Nd2 h5 {i could get smothered by his pawns} 25. Nf1 Bh4 26. e6 {maybe i should have played b to e-3, what do you think} Re2 27. Bf4 {i sacrifice my e pawn to get my bishop out and eat his c pawn} Rxe4 28. Bxc7 Rxe6 29. Be5+ {closing off the e file} Kh6 30. Ng3 g5 {some have said in comments that i should have played N to f5 .

Ra5 {silly mistake on my part- over confidence is setting in} a6 36. Re5 {back where i started} Rf3 37. Kg2 Rd3 {what should i do} 38. Ra5 {??} Rd2+ 39. Kf1 Rxb2 40.

Be1 Rb1 {oh no i could get smothered by his pawns} 44. d7 {this is to bring my rook across to attack his king and pawns and force his rook to go after the d pawn.   Black was threatening ...g3.  d8=Q? g2    Kg1 Rxe1       Kh2 Rh1#. Now that would have been a tragedy} Rd1 45. Rf6+ Ke4 46. Rh6 Rxd7 {i am now thinking - don't lose the games you shouldn't} 47. Rxh5 {game still not over yet} Kf3 48. a4 {'a' pawn puts pressure} Rf7 49. a5 {PRESSURE OF MY a PAWN} g3 {this move is where he lost the game for i simply move } 50. Rg5 {move my rook, his g pawn is lost} Ke3+ {check? no problem} 51. Kg2 Kf4 {i dont want to leave my a pawn unprotected so i will not take the g pawn with my rook} 52.
