1. e4 {The WINDMILL- a DREADED trap, leading to a win on move #29, always satisfying. Also involving a neat deflection trick on move 20. I read about the windmill 3 months ago and was dying to practise it. Repeated use of a dicovered check. Amazing what you can pick up by reading a book- Killer chess tactics- Keene et al. Pl comment freely and pl rate. Fasten your seat belts for here we go...} c5 2. f4 {Expanding into the kingside, my fav opening in last few months. Someone told me it is the Grand prix opening.  I dont know, not formally schooled in basics. I just go for stuff like windmill and have fun.} d6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {protect e4} g6 6. O-O {my lsb points at his kingside, plan is to advance f pawn and attack there. note that the f rook is also part of the plot. But things hazy at present} Bg7 7. d3 O-O 8. Be3 {just routine development} a6 9. a4 {stop b5, also allow lsb space to withdraw to a2 maintaining the attack on f7} b6 10. Ba2 Bb7 11. f5 {will not take his g pawn now, just advancing deep into his territory} e6 {that move of his is a mistake,  watch-} 12. fxe6 fxe6 13. Bxe6+ {see, he forgot about the serpent on a2 which uncoils and strikes. I am a pawn up} Kh8 14. Ng5 {Attack starts, no plan right now, supporting my lsb} Qe7 15. Qd2 {doubling up} Ne5 16. Bb3 {almost certainly his bishop will come to c8 so I withdraw, i plan to--} Bc8 {see} 17. Nd5 {--plan to move my knight up. I am suddenly dreaming of a WINDMILL, but need an uncluttered f file for my rook} Nxd5 18. Bxd5 {One more hurdle before I set up the windmill, can you guess what it is now} Rb8 {he protects his rook} 19. c3 Bd7 {WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW? please try and guess} 20. d4 {why did I do that- I needed to deflect his knight off e5. Why- watch} Ng4 {he wants to exchange with my dsb, actually I am not bothered for--} 21. Nf7+ {FINALLY, AFTER MONTHS OF WAITING- my first windmill} Kg8 {forced move of his king. Now the moment I move my knight, he will get a check from the bishop.  Thats great, only my knight does not move and gobble up something juicy, only a measly d6 pawn. My euphoria is checked. but hey, maybe this windmill can swing and swing---} 22. Nd8+ {need to remove his rook off the f file and temporarily put his b rook out of action. no idea how it will go} Kh8 23. Rxf8+ Bxf8 24. Nf7+ {windmill strikes again} Kg7 {he moves his king onto a dark square and my windmill is dead} 25. Bg5 {just harassing his q and advancing, no plan as such} Qe8 26. Bh6+ {just harassing} Nxh6 {bad move on his part for I --} 27. Qxh6+ {queen moves up.  if he moves to g8, the windmill will strike again (28. Ng5  followed by Qxh7 mate} Kf6 {he sensibly moves out but that brings my other rook up} 28. Rf1+ Ke7 29. Qg5# {At my age I dont have time to read basics and openings etc, which is why my rating is stuck at 1600. But I have read a few exciting things and sometimes get a chance to practice them.  This is chess for fun, hope you enjoyed. Pl comment freely and pl rate  }
