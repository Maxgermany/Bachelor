[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian Defense.} 2. h4 {White's most common responses are Nf3 or Nc3.  While h3 is uncommon, h4 appears to give black a bit of an advantage.} Nc6 3. h5 {Pushing a pawn into the black king side castle can be useful after black has castled.} Nf6 4. g3 {Pg3 leaves Pe4 undefended.} Nxe4 5. h6 gxh6 6. Rh4 d5 7. d3 Nf6 8. Bxh6 Bxh6 9. Rxh6 Be6 10. Bh3 Qa5+ 11. c3 Bxh3 12. Nxh3 O-O-O 13. b4 {Black has a pawn, knight, and queen guarding this square.  A trade leaves white down another pawn without improving his position or developing pieces.} cxb4 14. Qd2 bxc3 15. Nxc3 Nd4 {Here white must guard against Nf3+, which would give black the white queen.} 16. Ng5 {This does the trick, temporarily.  Black's counter will prove brutal.} Rhg8 {Black parries.  NxPf7 threatens the d8 rook, but gives black a queen and knight for a rook and pawn.  17. Nxf7 Nf3+ 18. Ke2 Nxd2 19. Nxd8 Qxc3 20. Rd1 (or somewhere the queen won't snatch it--maybe Re1).} 17. Rb1 {Instead of Rb1 white might better play Ne2.  Black will trade queens, probably followed by Nxe2. 19. Nxf7, Rdf8 20 Ne5 maybe, or Kxe2.  White is better off avoiding even trades now.} Rxg5 {Excellent move, because at first look it wouldn't seem the rook was worth a knight.} 18. Qxg5 Nf3+ {}
