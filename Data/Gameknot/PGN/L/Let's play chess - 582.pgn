1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {The Four Knights' Game, a placid opening. But the surface calmness proved to be covering a barrel of dynamite!} 4. Bb5 Nd4 5. Nxe5 {The fireworks begin.} Qe7 6. f4 Nxb5 {I expected my opponent to reply with 7 NxN. Instead...} 7. d4 {...he sacrifices the piece in return for central dominance and a strong attack.} Nxc3 {I naturally decide to try and simplify the game. If I can whittle down the wood, his attack will become less forceful.} 8. bxc3 d6 {I want to get the Knight away from its dominating position.} 9. Ba3 {A spectacular response.} Bg4 10. Qd3 Be6 11. f5 {He puts the squeeze on my position.} Bc8 12. O-O b6 {I prepare to break the pin on the QP, thus activating the threat to his Knight.} 13. c4 c5 14. Nc6 {No retreat! He presses the attack onwards.} Qc7 15. d5 Bb7 {I'm determined to get rid of the Knight.} 16. Rae1 Bxc6 17. dxc6 Qxc6 {I even won a Pawn in the exchange. But my King is still dangerously exposed.} 18. e5 dxe5 {A tough choice, but the center files are going to open up. I may as well open them on my terms.} 19. Rxe5+ Be7 {Forced.} 20. Rfe1 {Up a full piece, I'm willing to give it back to break the force of the attack. A draw is better than getting mated. My opponent's adavatage in position has been worth the sacrificed material throughout the game.} Qc7 21. Re5xe7+ {My opponent, by this move, decides a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. He settles for winning back the material and taking a draw.} Qxe7 {Forcing the recapture that breaks the attack.} 22. Rxe7+ Kxe7 {With a lot of the wood gone, an even endgame has emerged.} 23. Bb2 Rad8 {Draw agreed. My advantage of two Rooks against a Queen is compensated by my opponent's superior minor piece. A short, exciting game.}
