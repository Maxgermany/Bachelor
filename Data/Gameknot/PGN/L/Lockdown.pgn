[Opening "Bird's opening (A02)"]

1. f4 {Bird's opening.  I really don't know this opening.  My moves were not based on any lines per se, but on general opening moves that are played in most openings.} Nf6 2. e3 {Seems passive.} d5 3. c4 e6 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. cxd5 {I think this is bad because it releases my bishop.  The concept of keeping pieces trapped is what practically gives me victory.} exd5 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. O-O Bd6 8. Nc3 O-O 9. Bxc6 {I don't like this move because it gives me the bishop pair and trades off his good bishop.} Bxc6 10. Nd4 Bd7 11. Nce2 {No point in this retreat.  Correct was b3, getting his bishop into the game.} c5 12. Nf3 Re8 13. d4 {? Dooms his DSB to passivity after an eventual ...c4.} Bb5 14. Re1 Bxe2 {Since I'm about to play ...c4, my LSB will become a bad bishop and needs to be exchanged off.} 15. Rxe2 c4 {White's heavy pieces can't get out now.} 16. Ne5 Ne4 {Blockading a pawn sac e4, which would liberate white's pieces.} 17. Qc2 b5 {Beginning a pawn storm.} 18. a3 a5 19. Nc6 Qc8 20. Ne5 {? Just got my queen advanced with no time loss.} Qe6 21. Re1 b4 22. axb4 axb4 23. Rxa8 {White was forced to give up the a-file.  From now on, the black rook will dominate this file and deny white counterplay.} Rxa8 24. b3 {This was needed to prevent ...Ra2, which would have been crushing.} c3 {Creating a protected passed pawn and killing the white bishop.} 25. Rf1 {White can do little now.} h6 26. Qe2 Qe8 {! Preventing Qb5, which would break the lockdown.} 27. Qh5 {The queen has as many prospects here as it did on e2.} Ra2 {Getting a rook onto the seventh.} 28. Nd3 Qe6 29. f5 Qf6 {Stopping even f6, Nxf6, e4, which would still have been winning for black.} 30. g4 {?? Shame.  I guess my opponent missed that the black rook attacks h2.  Note that up to this point, material was equal, but black was clearly winning.  Stiffer was 30. Qg4.} Bxh2+ 31. Qxh2 {31. Kh1 Ng3#.} Rxh2 32. Kxh2 Qh4+ {I don't need the lock when I can get a crushing material advantage.  White resigned here, about to lose the Pg4, and I'll leave it to you to spot all the forks that pick up all of White's pieces.  I hope you all enjoyed this annotation.}
