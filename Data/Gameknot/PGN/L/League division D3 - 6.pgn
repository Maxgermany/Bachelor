1. c4 {My traditional English opening didn't see much happen for quite a few moves. } g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 e6 4. e4 b6 5. Nf3 Bb7 6. Be3 Nh6 {Interesting move from black keeping the bishop diagonal open. } 7. Bd3 c5 {The diagonal line becomes clearer with the aggressive pawn attack on d4.} 8. dxc5 bxc5 9. Bxc5 {It loses a pawn but presumably has positional advantages. } Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 Na6 11. Bd4 O-O 12. h3 {With the black knight out of position now let's trap it} f6 {Forcing kingside pawn move to create escape route.} 13. Rb1 Qc7 14. O-O e5 {But the pawn allows d5 to take control of the centre of the board. } 15. Be3 Kg7 16. Nd2 d6 {This pawn move coupled with the advanced king created a dangerous pinned queen potential. } 17. Nb3 Rad8 {The rook to d8 was a crucial error turning the game opportunity towards white. It didn't advance black's position and ceded the a pawn and created attacking lines. } 18. Bxa7 f5 {Aggressive pawn move to try and reclaim lost pawns but didn't protect threats around b7.} 19. Qe2 f4 20. Na5 {Aggressive move to attack b7. Queen could take knight, Rxb7+ wins B an still allows Bb6 clipping Q & R. } Bxe4 {Baffling move given Rb7 pins Q, Bb6 forces at least an exchange. Don't see the gain of the bishop sacrifice. } 21. Bb6 Bxd3 22. Qxd3 Nc5 23. Qd5 Qd7 24. Bxd8 Qxd8 25. Nb3 Nxb3 26. axb3 {Exchange plays through for exchange plus a doubled pawn lead. But still not an unassailable positional lead.} f3 27. c5 {Silly move from white. } fxg2 28. Qxg2 Rf5 {Trying to pin queen and regain lead. } 29. Kh2 dxc5 30. Qb7+ Kf8 31. Rba1 Ng4+ {Attempt to force white King into trapped corner. } 32. hxg4 Qh4+ 33. Kg1 Qxg4+ 34. Qg2 Qf4 35. Ra8+ Kg7 36. Ra7+ Kh6 37. Qh2+ {Rook checks forces this position removing last major black threat from the board.} Qxh2+ 38. Kxh2 Rh5+ 39. Kg3 Kg5 40. Ra5 Kf5 41. Rxc5 Rg5+ 42. Kf3 h5 43. Rh1 {Covering final black hope of queening h pawn. } Rg4 44. b4 Rf4+ 45. Ke3 h4 46. f3 g5 47. b5 {Raising the stakes of queening pawns} g4 48. fxg4+ Rxg4 {Was this a final error allowing white rooms control of the board. Without advancing the pawn chances. } 49. Rf1+ Ke6 50. Rc6+ Ke7 51. b6 h3 52. b7 {And black has lost the advancement game, can't advance own pawn and unable to stop white pawn without losing rook needed to defend own pawn. } Rg3+ 53. Ke4 {}
