1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 {Open Variation} Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 {Accelerated Dragon (I think)} 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O a6 {Looking for Q-side space} 9. a4 {Stopping b5} h6 {Hmmm...I guess to try and defend Qd2 with Kh7. Or maybe guarding g5.} 10. f4 {Space, K-side attack (f5), control of e5} e6 {Guarding f5, preparing d5. } 11. g4 {K-side attack, maybe a little premature} Nxd4 12. Bxd4 b6 {Trying to fianchetto, control d5 and e4} 13. f5 Bb7 {Unexpected, but, I think, questionable. he probably should have taken f5} 14. e5 {N has to move...} Ne4 15. f6 {Then bishop is trapped (forever?)} Bh8 16. Nxe4 Bxe4 17. Be3 {Hitting h6, preparing Qd4 or Qd2} g5 18. h4 Qc7 19. Qd4 {Here I mistakenly thought I could trap his Q after Q X c2.  } Qxc2 {Now even after Q X b6 I don't like the looks of Rb8. I still think my plan will work. } 20. hxg5 {Unecessary} Bg6 {Surprising and, I think, unnecessary (and later costly)} 21. Rac1 {Plan "Q"} Qxe2 {and now I see that Rf2 doesn't work. Whoops. There goes the win } 22. gxh6 {At least his bishop is worthless} Rac8 {Trades} 23. Rf2 {nothing much better} Rxc1+ 24. Bxc1 Qe4 {Q trade is bad, but I have to hold g4} 25. Qxe4 Bxe4 {I see how I can keep K and Dark-squared bishop entombed, so I just have to hold Q-side w/K & R or B & R, pawn down} 26. Be3 Rb8 27. Rd2 {holding D-pawn, readying Rd4} Bc6 28. b3 {or b3} Kh7 29. Kf2 {I decide on K to hold K-side} b5 30. a5 {Yay!} Kg6 31. Kg3 b4 {Now I'm 90% sure that I'll survive} 32. Kf4 {h-pawn doesn't matter, and if K-takes, Rh2, g5, and Rh6} Rb5 33. Bb6 {Guards a5 and c5} Bd5 34. Rd3 {Guards b3} Bc6 35. Rd4 {Ties down R (no Rd5!)} Kxh6 {Nothing better} 36. Bd8 {I have draw} d5 {Yay! No more Rd5} 37. Bb6 {en passant FAILS to e5+} Kh7 {Maybe going to Q-side? } 38. Kg5 {Stay! Knowing the game was drawn, I offered a draw. He accepted. This game demonstrates the effective creation of a non-absolute fortress (with a little help).}
