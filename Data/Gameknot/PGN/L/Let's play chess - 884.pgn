1. e4 e5 {King Pawn!} 2. Qf3 d6 {D'oh! Why do they always bring the lady out early...} 3. Bc4 Nh6 {Look how he gets me here! This is awesome. I have the pawn defended by the knight on h6. They can't go for the instant mate.} 4. d4 Nc6 {He brings his pawn out, but I don't have to worry about that, right? Because my pawn is guarded!} 5. Bxh6 f6 {Bam! He's got my knight, and I can't take his bishop back, because if  I do it's checkmate, so I move the pawn up allowing the bishop to escape.} 6. Qh5+ g6 {But he doesn't escape, and I have  to screw my pawn structure  pushing the lady out!} 7. Qh4 Nxd4 {She steps back, and although what I want to take that dang bishop, I'm already behind and the even trade won't help, so all I can get is a pawn for my troubles.  Having the bishop and queen in my space it seemed only a matter of time before I get wrecked. With only a potential knight fork to bargain with, I squeeze out of the game with a draw.}
