1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 {The "Wayward" Queen attack} Nc6 3. a3 Nf6 4. Qe2 Nd4 {Queen is forced back to d1 for a serious loss of tempo} 5. Qd3 {Guess I was wrong, but if he insists on losing tempo ...} d5 6. Nc3 dxe4 {My expectations: 7. Nxe4, Bf5 for the half-pin on the knight. Expecting to have to handle 8. Nxf6 , Qxf6} 7. Nxe4 Bf5 8. f3 Qd5 {I am still uncertain about this move. 9. Nxf6 ,gxf6 leaves me with a doubled pawn, but ensures either the loss of his a-rook or in the worst-case a knight-rook exchange. That may be why my opponent insisted on keeping his knight in position.} 9. c4 Bxe4 10. fxe4 Qxe4+ 11. Qxe4 Nxe4 {gained an important one pawn advantage in this series of exchanges while maintaining the threat of 12. Nc2  for the rook. Additionally (on hindsight) it leaves his h-rook vulnerable to Nf2, should my bishop be able to get to c5 to support it.} 12. Bd3 Nc5 13. Bf5 {Seems like a terrible blunder, but he would have lost a bishop anyways had he gone for 13. Bb1,Nb3 14. Ra2,Nxc1 15. Ra1,Nb3 (for the getaway followed by O-O-O or bishop activation). The blunder probably happened with his attempt to defend an indefensible position.} Nxf5 14. Ke2 {Takes the opportunity to extricate himself from an extremely bad spot.} O-O-O 15. Nf3 Nd4+ 16. Nxd4 Rxd4 {exchanging pieces now is extremely beneficial to me especially if I can get more troops out while his queenside rook and bishop are essentially stuck.} 17. g3 {Not sure what he wanted to achieve with that, but I was gonna take the opportunity to clear away an annoying pawn and possibly position myself for a better attack (the fact that my bishop has yet to find a reasonable position to move to has troubled me for a while now).} Rxc4 18. d3 Rc2+ {probably took the chance to push the pawn and free his bishop (impossible earlier with the rook at d4).} 19. Ke3 Nb3 {Nb3 was designed to waste his time moving his ineffective rook to safety while freeing the c5 square for my bishop to finally play a useful role in the game. Frankly, at this point, I'm not certain I was willing to take his rook with my very powerful knight should he chose 20. Rf1 to make better use of his other rook instead.} 20. Rb1 {Only choice if he wants to avoid the devastating loss of a potentially useful bishop.} f5 {I considered 20. Rb1,Bc5  but realized it served little purpose. Notice the King is no longer able to return to rank 2 because of my rook. f5 is intended to ensure he cannot even try to approach my lines, essentially trapping the poor fella for a possible mating position. I felt I had time on my side to pull this off.} 21. Rf1 {I had considered Rxh2 should he vacate the h1 spot, but Rf1 just made his piece seriously dangerous.} Bc5+ {This is my (first time ever for me!!!) expected combo: 22. Kf3 (forced - I should have activated a conditional move instead of making the guy wait on a response to a forced move),Rf8 23. ...,e4  24. dxe4, fxe4  costing him a rook and granting me enough forces to finally take that bishop without answer.} 22. Kf3 Rf8 23. g4 {My expected sequence would be of somewhat greater value for my opponent, pawn for rook (not that it matters). Instead, by this move, he's simply offering the rook for free.} fxg4+ {It is pretty much over for him at this point. 24. Kxg4,Rxf1 25. ...,Rxc1 forces a rook exchange. Any attempt to move his bishop simply loses him the b-rook with little in the way of compensation (no threat to King nor any other major piece).} 24. Kxg4 Rxf1 25. Kh3 Rfxc1 26. Rxc1 Nxc1 27. b4 Bg1 28. Kg4 Rxh2 29. Kf5 Bd4 30. Ke6 Nxd3 {}
