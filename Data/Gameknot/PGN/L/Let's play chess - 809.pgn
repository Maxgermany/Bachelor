1. Nf3 e6 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 g6 {3. ... g6 is inconsistent with 1. ... e6, not necessarily because it weakens the dark squares, but because the bishop is just as happy at e7 or d6 and the move played is inviting white to play h2-h4-h5 in due course. } 4. O-O Bg7 5. d3 {5. d4 and 5. c4 are equally playable, although Black can then play ... d5 and ... c6, with a Stonewall plan} O-O 6. e4 c6 {Too slow.  Black's counterplay in the King's Indian Attack needs to come from swift queen side advances, or exchanges in the centre.  6. ... c5 or d5 was better.} 7. Nbd2 d5 8. Re1 {There's no rush to play 8. e5 because if Black plays 8. ... de, then 9. de emphasises that Black's pawns are on the wrong squares. } Nbd7 9. e5 {Now the pawn can be pushed.  If 9. ... Ne8, White continues with Nf1, h4 etc as per the game but doesn't need to play d4.} Ng4 10. d4 c5 11. c3 {Now we have a bizarre French Advance version where both sides decided to fianchetto.  White has more space and a solid position.  Black's knight on g4 is exposed and there is no obvious counterplay. } b5 12. Nf1 {A typical development in the KIA, freeing up the c1-h6 diagonal and planning h4, Nh2-g4 aiming at f6 and h6} f5 {12. ... f6 is probably better - attacking e5 directly, although 12. ... a5 is probably most consistent. } 13. h3 Nh6 14. Bg5 {Now the dark squares look very weak.  } Qc7 {14. ... Qb6 is probably better and 14. ... Qa5 attacking c3 might be slightly better still.  White is happy to abandon the queenside because there are no immediate weaknesses and he's attacking the king. } 15. h4 {15. Be7 follows the game plan, but h4 is more useful than a5.  In some lines the pawn merely supports the Bg5, but in others h5, hxg6 causes Black problems.  Black has castled into an attack which he probably didn't see coming. } a5 16. Be7 {Switching diagonals and coming to d6 with tempo.} Rf7 {At least 16. ... Re8 gives some support to e6.  Black's position is already going horribly wrong. } 17. Bd6 Qd8 {17. ... Qb6 looks stronger.  Black will have to exchange on d4 if he is to hold e6 though. } 18. dxc5 Bf8 {The bishop returns to the proper diagonal, but Black is already lost.  White keeps attacking e6 and it soon falls. } 19. Ng5 Bxd6 20. cxd6 {There's no rush.  The Rf7 isn't going anywhere useful, the Nh6 is offside, the Bc8 is useless and the Nd7 has few useful squares.  White's development, whilst discreet, is practically full and, with only 3 pieces off the board, the Black king is ominously exposed. } Rf8 21. Nxe6 Qb6 22. Bxd5 {Again, there is no hurry to play Nxf8.  Now everything falls. } Bb7 23. Nxf8+ {1-0}
