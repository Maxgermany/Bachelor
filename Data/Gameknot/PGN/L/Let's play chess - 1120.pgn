[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 {This actually is my first game with this opening.} 2. e3 {Apparently the Stonewall Attack.} d5 3. h3 {This move seems too early; Bg4 or Ng4 weren't really threats.} e6 {My bishop can't go to g4 anyways, so this move to free the other bishop seems natural.} 4. Nf3 c5 {Threatening to trade my pawn for a more central one.} 5. dxc5 Bxc5 6. Bb5+ Nc6 7. Bxc6+ {Fine by me.  White loses the bishop pair and I centralize a pawn.  It also opens the b file for the rook and allows the bishop to move out to a6.} bxc6 8. Ne5 {Attacking c6.} Qd6 {Defending, attacking, and developing.} 9. Nd3 Ba6 10. Nxc5 Qxc5 11. Nc3 O-O {I'd like this rook to be on the d file.} 12. Ne2 {Allowing castling.  Note that white has moved knights five moves in a row; I believe this gives black a slight advantage.} Rab8 13. O-O Rfd8 14. a3 {Probably preparing b4.} e5 {Preparing d4.} 15. c3 {Defending the d4 square.} Bxe2 {Removing two defenders of the d4 square.} 16. Qxe2 d4 17. exd4 exd4 18. cxd4 Qxd4 19. Bg5 {The pin is toothless; this move leaves the b2 pawn underdefended.  As this gives me a passed pawn, I think this is the losing move.} Rxb2 {This also attacks the queen in addition to winning the pawn..} 20. Qe3 Qxe3 {I decide to simplify and try to push the c pawn to promotion.} 21. Bxe3 {Not 21. fxe3? Rdd2, where material loss and a strong attack is unavoidable.} a6 {Not 21...a5 22. a4, when the pawn is stuck on a dark square.} 22. Bg5 c5 {The bishop can't get to the pawn on c5 quickly (as it turns out, the rooks delayed it long enough), and getting to c3 is more difficult.} 23. Rfc1 Rc8 {I have the advantage with the rook behind the pawn.} 24. Rc4 {Stopping the pawn's progress.} Nd7 {Adding a defender to the pawn and ready to threaten the rook with Ne5.} 25. Rd1 Rb7 {Defending the knight and preparing to double rooks. Not 25...Ne5? 26. Rxc5 Rxc5?? Re8#.} 26. Be3 f6 {Eliminating the risk of a back-rank mate and letting the king move to f7.} 27. Rdc1 Rbc7 28. Ra4 Rc7c6 29. Rac4 {A useless excursion by the rook.} Kf7 {Now the king moves in to help.} 30. a4 Ke6 31. Re1 Kd5 32. Rc2 c4 {The pawn advances at last.} 33. Rd2+ {A nice tactic that wins a pawn after 33...Ke6 34. Bh6  Ne5 35. Bxg7.  There was a better tactic; see the next note.} Ke6 34. Bh6+ {White missed a potentially winning tactic: 34. Ba7  Ne5 35. f4, winning the knight.} Ne5 35. Bxg7 c3 36. Rc2 Kf7 {Unpinning the knight.} 37. Bh6 Nd3 38. Re4 {Trying to prevent Nb4.} Rc6c4 {Forcing a rook exchange or a retreat.} 39. Rxc4 Rxc4 40. Be3 Nb4 41. Rc1 c2 {Almost there.} 42. Kf1 Na2 {Driving the rook away so the pawn can finally promote.  White will have to sacrifice his bishop for the promoted pawn.} 43. Ra1 {This defends the a pawn after the exchanges.} c1=Q+ 44. Bxc1 Nxc1 {Better would have been 44...Rxc1  45. Rxc1 Nxc1, with a simplified position.} 45. g3 Nb3 {With the intention of winning the a pawn with 46. Ra3 Nc5 47. a5 Nb7, with 48...Rc5 and 49....Nxa5 to follow.} 46. Rb1 {Unfortunately, white didn't realize this lost the rook to 46...Nd2  until after he moved, so he resigned.}
