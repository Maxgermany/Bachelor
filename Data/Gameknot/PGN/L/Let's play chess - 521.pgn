1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 e5 3. c3 Bc5 {I now have complete control of the four most important squares on the board. (Not a win, but a step toward it!)} 4. h3 O-O {I castle as a precaution, before I make any attack.} 5. b4 {White is not comfortable with my bishop on c5!    He also wants to build a nice pawn defense on his queen side.} Bb6 {Back step!} 6. Na3 a5 7. b5 {White sees my threatening rook, and moves b5 instead of taking my pawn on a5. (A reasonable move!)} Bc5 8. Nc4 {White looks for a way to get his horse on b6 with hopes of taking my bishop or rook forcefully. He must first divert my bishop on c5 first though.} c6 {White had planned to use his pawn on b5 to be the distraction, but....} 9. bxc6 {...that is all to change!} dxc6 10. Nxe5 {White dumps his past plans and tries some other tactic.} Bd6 {I repel him.} 11. Ng4 {Retreat? No, attack. By taking my knight on f6 he would force me to use my pawn defense to take him, which is meant for guarding my king, and thus open a weak spot for a future checkmate!} Nbd7 {So, I back him up!} 12. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {Well I'm going to try something different to my advantage.} 13. g3 Qxc3+ {Check! A forced move is made by White!} 14. Bd2 Qf6 15. h4 Be5 {His rook is in peril, and so he is once again forced to move. } 16. Rb1 Bc3 {Sacrifices have to be made during a game in order to gain a more advantages position.} 17. Bxc3 Qxc3+ {Ah! that was excellent!} 18. Qd2 Qxd2+ {I will now sacrificing my queen because I have the better position. He is now almost helpless to checkmate me without sacrificing of many valuable pieces!} 19. Kxd2 Nf6 20. Nf3 Bg4 {Now, for an attack!} 21. Ne5 Rae8 22. f4 Re6 23. Rxb7 {Hmmm, he is going to regret that move!} Rd8 24. Bh3 Bxh3 {He is down a bishop. What he fails to realize is that his fully exposed king gives me the odds of winning. It is to late to sacrifice pieces now he needs to get his king to a more protected spot! } 25. Rxh3 Nxe4+ {To late!} 26. Ke3 Nd6 {The white rook is forced into a worse position.} 27. Ra7 f6 {The white horse is totaled!} 28. f5 Rxe5+ {The white king is on the run now.....} 29. Kf4 {...heading for what looks like a safe place, but....} Rxf5+ {....it's more like a trap!} 30. Kg4 {Adios, mate!} h5# {CHECKMATE!  The most important losing factor for white was that he did not keep his king covered. It cannot be stressed enough! The most important piece is NOT the queen, But....the king! It must be given #1 priority in our strategies!                                                                                                    I hope this annotation will helped you with future chess games, good luck to all!}
