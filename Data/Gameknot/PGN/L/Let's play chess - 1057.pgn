1. e4 {basic e4 move, my favourite} h5 {thats an unusual move?????} 2. Nf3 {good developing move} d5 {attacks at last } 3. Nc3 {silly move he can do d4} d4 {he does} 4. Nb5 {i decide to attack and am attacking pawn on e4} Bg4 {good move. this stops me from taking e4 with both my knights.} 5. Nbxd4 {i take anyway} e5 {attack me} 6. Nxe5 {really bad move. i wasn't thinking.} Bxd1 7. Kxd1 {i wanted to resign but i thought i could still win it.} Qxd4 {maybe not.} 8. Nf3 Qd8 9. d3 {good pawn structure is a good sign of defence.} Bc5 10. Be3 {shouldn't have done the exchange. i might of needed that bishop and i was losing} Bxe3 11. fxe3 c6 {c6 is played so he can get his queen out} 12. g3 {try to get my bishop developed} Qb6 13.
