1. e4 {The game was known theory until move 13 by black, after some more moves both black and white achieved a passed pawn, the difference is white was able to keep pushing it while keeping the initiative, and black only push it foreword to late in the game, eventually white's more active pieces and space advantage forced black's resignation... } Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 4. d4 d6 5. Nf3 {following the game kaspanatola-iakobos; Gameknot; 2011; 1-0, the main idea is to develop a piece before the exchange exd6} Bg4 6. exd6 exd6 {here black correctly in my opinion diverged from kaspanatola-iakobos; Gameknot; 2011; 1-0} 7. h3 Bh5 8. Be2 Be7 9. O-O O-O 10. Nc3 Nc6 11. b3 {keeping the game in the theory... b3 is the main line, and slightly better for white, but has a drawish tendency (from white's point of view, 16 games : 37.5% wins 6.3% loses 56.3% draws)} Bf6 12. Be3 Bg6 13. Qd2 a5 {leaving the previous trails... black diverges from previous games... Re8 was the choice four times with mixed results, while d5 played in Caruana Fabiano (ITA) - Farago Sandor (HUN), Budapest (Hungary), 2005, lead to a loss. with a5 black supports a possible Nb4 and avoids a4 by white creating an hole on b4, white has to reserve a3 to chase away the knight if ever played to b4, while the Nb4 doesn't seam to be much annoying it can support Bc2, so I've decided to exchange the ligh squared bishops } 14. Bd3 {the idea is to prepare Rab1 supporting the b4 push, which would remove the threat of the hole, but black has Bxd3} Bxd3 15. Qxd3 {only} a4 {forces some tension on to the positiion} 16. Ne4 {with the idea of Nxf6} d5 {? I get black0's idea to block my d pawn and by that restrain my dark squared bishop, but now I'll be able to create a passed pawn in the a column that might decide the endgme, after some exchanges} 17. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {forced} 18. c5 {I'm still hindered with the presence of a bad bishop, but I can open up the position slightly maybe just enough to improve my bishop, let's see} Nd7 19. bxa4 {here is the potential passed pawn, black can't afford to allow me to exchange knights on c6 because then bxc6 will finally create an a column passed pawn, now if Rxa4 I have Qb3 attacking three targets at once} Rfb8 {the best reply, but I still have Qb3} 20. Qb3 Qf5 {defending the d pawn and threatening to infiltrate my field} 21. Rfe1 {to occupy the open column} Nf8 {Ne8-e6 to get the d4 pawn is maybe white's idea} 22. Rab1 {and to occupy the semi-open column, I've now maximized my rooks, black ones are looking silly placed side by side on a8 and b8} Ne6 {black looks fine it's might be better to hold the position as it is, than to capture the d pawn which releases my bad bishop} 23. Ne5 {threatening the already referenced exchange on c6 that creates my passed pawn, but first I need to move my queen} Nexd4 {?! I have my doubts about this move} 24. Bxd4 Nxd4 25. Qd1 Nc6 {black can't defend the knight on d4} 26. Nxc6 {so I'll finally get my passed pawn} bxc6 27. Rb3 {setting a trap:  Rxb3 allows me axb3 with a clearly better endgame  Rxa4 allows me Rxb8+ with mate in the next move} Kf8 {!? curious move, having the king defend the open column, with so little material on the board might be black's best chance to draw} 28. Qd2 {preparing a5 and Reb1, while setting again the same trap as before Rxa4 loses to Rxb8+Qc8 Rxc8++} Rbd8 29. Rf3 {I'll get one tempo and push my pawn in the next move} Qd7 30. a5 {and I'll push my pawn a little further} Rde8 31. Ra3 {again defending the pawn} Rxe1+ 32. Qxe1 {another exchange black figures he is getting out of space maybe better to avoid the mate threats on the first rank} Qc8 {black has lost any ideas, of his last five moves 28.Rd8 then 30.Re8 and 29.Qd7 then 31.Qc8 he just doesn't seams to know were to put his pieces} 33. Qb1 g6 34. Qd3 {now let's support another pawn push} f6 35. a6 Qe8 {finally some counter-play from black the idea is to get to e1 with check, black is back on fighting} 36. Qd2 {... preventing black's idea} Ra7 {? blocking the pawn, but leaves the first rank, so it can be a liability for black} 37. h4 {but now I'll put some pressure on the other wing without exposing my king much not to allow some perpetual, the main strategical idea now is to expose black's king and allow infiltration of black's field, h5 will follow soon} Kg7 {forced, but now it leaves the defence of the open column, a defence I praised a few moves back...} 38. Re3 {leaving the a pawn hanging while threatening black's queen, the idea is to get my queen behind my rook and play Re7+} Qf8 39. Qe2 {sacrifices the c pawn, threatening to infiltrate black's position so Kf7 is in order...} Kf7 {expected, as if Qxc5 I have Re7+ successfully infiltrating black's position while keeping the initiative, black's king can't defend both his wing pawns and the e column} 40. h5 {! again I can sacrifice the c pawn, because if Qxc5 I have hxg6+ and then black has noting better than capture it exposing his king to further attacks, and if gxh5 I have Qxh5+ Kg7 (as Kg8 loses the queen to Re8 with a skewer)} Ra8 {this must be black's best move here, he temporarily solved his back rank problems, but now...} 41. hxg6+ {i can open up the king's position a little further} hxg6 42. Qg4 {threatening Qd7+} Qc8 {black offers the exchange which I should not accept as he would have an easier task then... can maybe even achieve a draw} 43. Qg3 {aimed at c7 if:  - Rxa6? I have Qh2 still aimed at c7 but also with the idea of playing Qh7 and black's queen is overloaded - Qa6? I have the immediate Qxc7+ successfully infiltrating black's field } d4 {not much of a nuisance...} 44. Re4 {now I threat both d4 and Rh4} Qb8 {with the idea of playing Qb1+ with tempo} 45. Kh2 {avoids giving black one tempo to play Qb1 and grab the a2 pawn, also Qh8 is not possible in view of Rh4 with tempo for white} Qd8 46. Rh4 {now my threat is Rh7+} Kg7 {prevents it} 47. Qh3 {reinforces the threat by protecting the rook from behind} f5 {only way is to get an escape square for the king as Rh7 is now unavoidable } 48. Rh7+ Kf6 {only move and black resigned after it, as nothing can be done to hamper white's way to the victory}
