1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 Qe7 4. d4 Nc6 5. Nd3 d6 6. e5 Nxd4 7. Be2 dxe5 8. O-O Bf5 9. Nc3 e4 10. Nf4 O-O-O 11. Be3 Qe5 {11... Nf3 ch wins the Queen for the Rook and the Knight.} 12. Qb1 Bd6 13. g3 Nxe2+ 14. Nfxe2 Bh3 15. f4 Qh5 16. Qe1 Ng4 17. Bxa7 Bg2 {It seems to me 17... Bxf1 winning the Rook was better. i.e. 17...Bxf1 18. Kxf1 Qh3 ch 19. Kg1 Qxh2 ch 20. Kf1 Qh1 ch 21. Ng1 (if 21. Bg1 Nh2 ch 22. Kf2 Qf3#) b6 etc.} 18. h4 g5 {18... Bxf1 still was available. i.e. 18... Bxf1 19. Kxf1 b6 etc. 18... g5 just loses the pawn.} 19. fxg5 b6 {b6 was dangerous here because of the threat of Nf4, making things very difficult for Black.} 20. Nb5 Bc5+ 21. Kxg2 Ne3+ 22. Kg1 Nxc2+ 23. Ned4 Nxe1 24. Rfxe1 Rxd4 {I think taking with the Rook shouldn't have worked here, because White misplayed at move 26 to allow mate. 26. Kh2 would have been, at least temporarily, safe. My preference here would have been 24... Bxd4 winning the Knight outright.} 25. Nxd4 Bxd4+ 26. Kf1 Qf3# {}
