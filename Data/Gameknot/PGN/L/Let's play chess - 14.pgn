1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 b6 {Black: “This was a mistake.  I routinely play the Nimzo-Indian Defense against 3.Nc6 and the Queen’s Indian Defense against 3.Nf3.  Having just made moves as White in several other games (where the c-file is on my left) and with other games waiting for my move I played in haste without even looking at the board, believing my opponent had developed his other knight.”} 4. e4 d6 5. h3 Bb7 6. Bd3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 e5 8. d5 Be7 {9.Be3 now seems like a natural continuation after which Black intended to take over the queen side with 9.… a5, but White does not cooperate, making a case for playing that move now instead of the text.} 9. b4 O-O 10. Be3 a5 11. b5 Nc5 12. O-O h6 13. Qd2 Bc8 14. Nh2 Bd7 15. f4 Be8 {Black realizes that any chance either side has for a full point lies on the king side, but he plays it safe instead of taking the initiative there with 15.… exf4 16.Rxf4 Nh5 17.Rf3 Bh4.} 16. fxe5 dxe5 17. Nf3 Bd6 18. Bc2 {In such a closed position knights are more mobile than bishops, hence White should actually have wanted Black to play 18.… Nxd3.  Moreover, the previous note suggests taking the initiative on the king side, with 18.g4 for example.} Nh7 19. Ne2 g5 {[?] The losing move for it creates a hole on f5 that White can exploit with his knights.  Having committed to playing defense it would have been better to accept the embarrassment of 19.… Bd7, which he has to do next move anyway.  NB.  GameKnot does not have a function for adding move evaluation marks to a game score, hence I have adopted a standard of enclosing them in brackets in the note proper.} 20. Ng3 Bd7 21. Nh5 f6 22. Rf2 Be8 23. Ng3 Bg6 24. Nh2 h5 25. Nf5 Bxf5 26. Rxf5 Kg7 27. Raf1 Qe8 28. h4 {[!]} Qg6 {The natural push-by, 28.… g4?, loses the exchange to 29.Bh6+.} 29. hxg5 Be7 30. Nf3 {[!] 29.… fxg5 would also have failed against this move, just not as badly as it turns out.} Nxg5 31. Bxg5 fxg5 32. Nxg5 Rxf5 33. Rxf5 {Correctly rejecting 33.exf5 Qxg5 34.f6+ Bxf6.} Bf6 34. Qe3 Rh8 35. Bd1 Kf8 36. Be2 Ke7 37. Nf3 Kd6 38. Kf2 Rg8 39. Bf1 Rg7 40. Nd4 {[?!] Given his pawn plus perhaps White should have taken a more conservative approach and brought his king into play on e1 or e2.  It is difficult to argue with results, however, given Black’s rejection of 40.… exd4 41.e5+ Kd7 (and not 41.… Ke7 42.exf6+).} Bh4+ 41.

The text also works until …} 42. Qf4+ Kd7 43. Qxh4 Rh7 {[?] … Black fails to recognize the power of his passed pawn with 43.… d3.  Now ♪ it won’t be long before it’s crying time. ♪} 44.
