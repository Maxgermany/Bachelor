1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nc3 e6 {Standard stuff so far.} 5. e4 Bb4 6. Bxc4 Nge7 7. O-O O-O {Both me and my opponent complete our King-side development.} 8. Bg5 Bxc3 9. bxc3 h6 10. Bh4 {I try to draw my opponent into playing P-KN4, breaking the pin but opening up his castled position. But it doesn't work.} Qd7 11. Bb5 {I always try to pin enemy pieces when i can. It restricts their options.} a6 12. Ne5 Qd6 13. Bxc6 Nxc6 {So far the game has remained even.} 14. f4 Nxe5 15. fxe5 Qc6 {I have to be careful not to lose a Pawn in the center. The doubled KP is a weakness.} 16. Qd3 a5 17. Be1 {I defend the base of my Pawn chain.} b6 {I overlook the effect of this move.} 18. Bd2 Ba6 {Nicely played. Now I lose the Exchange. 18 Q-K3 was the move I should have played to avoid it.} 19. Qe3 {One move late.} Bxf1 20. Rxf1 Qe8 {A mistake. Ahead in material, my opponent should be advancing instead of retreating.} 21. Qg3 {Now I must be aggressive. i try hereabouts to formulate a mating attack. I am aiming, if my opponent permits, to play 22 BxP and follow up with 23 QxP mate.} Kh8 22. Rf4 f6 23. Rh4 {Hoping my opponent would think the KRP is sufficiently guarded. I try for 24 BxP PxB 25 RxP mate.} h5 24. Qf3 {My goal now is to win back the material and press the attack. I threaten 25 RxP ch.} g6 {Now the KBP is insufficiently guarded, enabling me to create a passed Pawn and undouble my Pawns.} 25. exf6 Rf7 26. e5 {A protected passed Pawn. Now I can fix my opponent's pieces.} Rh7 27. Qd3 Qf7 {My opponent defends well.} 28. Rh3 Rd8 29. Rg3 {Applying more pressure.} Rg8 30. h4 {Locking the position. Neither side can accomplish much, and I'm happy to take a draw given that I'm still behind in material.}
