1. Nc3 Nf6 2. g3 d5 3. e3 c5 4. d4 e6 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. b3 Bd7 7. Bb2 Rc8 8. Bg2 cxd4 9. Nxd4 Be7 10. e4 dxe4 11. Nxe4 O-O 12. Nxf6+ Bxf6 13. O-O Qe7 14. Nxc6 Bxc6 15. Bxf6 Qxf6 16. Bxc6 Rxc6 {silly exchange from me and at this point I made the game really boring.....not intended that way!} 17. c4 {The next 10 moves are the kind of thing I really hate, both are equal and waiting for the other to make a fatal error!} Rd8 18. Qe2 Rcd6 19. c5 Rd6d2 20. Qb5 Qf3 21. a4 h5 22. Rae1 h4 23. Re3 Qd5 24. gxh4 {one up, not bad.} Rd7 25. Qb4 Rd4 26. Qc3 {very easily taken back.} Rxh4 27. Rg3 {very obvious, I know!} g6 28. Qf6 {????} Qh5 {again he tries to focus on one unprotected pawn} 29. Rg5 Rg4+ 30. Rxg4 Qxg4+ 31. Kh1 Rd5 32. Rg1 Rd1 33. Rxd1 Qxd1+ 34. Kg2 {now not only even, but also really boring. I offered a draw here, he declined} Qxb3 35. Qd8+ Kg7 36. Qd4+ f6 {he was forced to move that, as other alternatives will only mean a continuous hail of checks.... and that is what I intended, especially with one pawn down} 37. Qd7+ Kh6 38. a5 {I had to protect what is left as at this stage "every pawn counts"} Qd5+ {big mistake...I maybe a pawn down but clearly the remainder are in the right place on the grid} 39. Qxd5 exd5 40. a6 bxa6 41. c6 {the moral of the story is, not to leave a loose pawn right from the beginning. I had this happen to me several times with catastrophic results} Kg5 42. c7 Kf5 43. c8=Q+ Ke5 {his plan is to protect the queen he " assumes he will get". My plan is to take all his pawns, then the last one,during which I loose my queen only to get another} 44. Qxa6 g5 45. Qxa7 d4 46. Qc5+ Ke4 47. f3+ Ke3 48. Qe7+ Kd2 49. Qxf6 {now he sees my plan maybe better. }
