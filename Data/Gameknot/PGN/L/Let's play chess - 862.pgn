1. d4 { WATCH ME PLAY STUPIDLY!  I play this about half the time} d5 2. c4 h6 {bg5 is not something I usually play anyway} 3. Nf3 {more center control} Nf6 4. cxd5 {I figure i can push his knight around while developing} Nxd5 5. e4 Nf6 6. e5 Nd5 7. Bc4 {and it works fairly well. I have my piece established and he is busy moving his knight} Nb6 8. Qb3 {possibly a mistake but also threatens bf7+ which leads to kd7 and hten maybe e6+ putting the pawn in a powerful well-protected position} e6 {defended against that} 9. Be3 {wanted more backup on d4 pawn, better than bf4 i think because d4 pawn make move while e5 pawn wont. Maybe bd2 would have been better or nc3} a6 10. O-O Nc6 11. a3 {I though he was going to b4 but I missed the trap that followed} Na5 {threatens queen which stops me from bringing an additional defender to bishop} 12. Bb5+ {Knowing that the bishop is doomed I figure that I can atleast get a pawn out of it} c6 {Chooses not to take. A mistake I think because instead of losing the a pawn black loses the b pawn} 13. Bxc6+ bxc6 14. Qc2 Nd5 15. b4 {pushing the knight away from protecting c6} Nb7 16. Qxc6+ Bd7 17. Qc2 Be7 18. Nbd2 Rc8 19. Qd3 {an error} Bb5 20. Qb3 Bxf1 21. Kxf1 O-O 22. Ne4 Rc3 23. Qa4 {WHY NOT nxc3!?} Nxe3+ 24. fxe3 Rxe3 25. Ng3 f6 26. Qxa6 Qc7 27. Qxe6+ Rf7 28. Nf5 Rd3 29. d5 Qc4 30. Nxe7+ Kh7 31. Qxf7 {White has mate if black gives me a turn...} Rxf3+ 32. Kg1 Qd4+ 33. Kh1 Qxa1# {but alas no}
