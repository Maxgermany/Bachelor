1. d4 {Now watch a 14 year old Kid (myself) beat a Adult. I am playing white I start with D4 pawn I love this opening it gains so much of the middle, also opening my black bishop.} d5 {The response is D5 pawn I love when opponents play the pawn right back. This move will result in an action packed game.(offensive)} 2. Nc3 {I play the knight need to get my pieces out} c6 {A small pawn push which blocks me from bringing my Knight up teh board in the future} 3. Bf4 {A small pawn push which blocks me from bringing my Knight up the board in the future} Nd7 {Playing the knight in the backfield results in more of a defensive game. Trying to close gaps through-out the game} 4. Nf3 {This takes up full middle and I am confident I have an advantage} h6 {Just wasting time her other knight would have been way better} 5. e4 {The big pawn push I wanted to open the game and this is what I do. Hopefully she takes and I can plant my knight right in the middle of the board. Just remember the pawn on D5 is attacked and if she doesn't protect it I can capture it for free.} b5 {Weird move that was the wrong time to push that pawn I will capture D5 with joy and go one pawn ahead.} 6. exd5 {I capture} Bb7 {I was expecting to take my double pawn line but he bring out the bishop if I take the pawn on C6 the pawn on B5 is attack with two pieces resulting in another capture.} 7. dxc6 {I take } Bxc6 {the bishop goes into place but B5 pawn is gone!!} 8. Nxb5 {I take with the knight treating check on c7 resulting her to lose the queen all she has to do is remove the knight with the bishop and I then take the bishop just an exchange.} a6 {No!!!!!!!!!! She  forgets where my Knight can go she just attacks the Knight} 9. Nc7+ {This knight has been a Hero to his team } Qxc7 {has to sacrifice the queen resulting in losing 9 points it starts to be a nightmare for her from here} 10. Bxc7 {take the queen with my bishop} Rc8 {attacks my bishop very predictable} 11. Bg3 {just have to retreat sometimes} Rb8 {whoa!!!!! moves the rook to attack B2 not noticing bishop can come back} 12. Bxb8 {Bye Bye rook he just went on vacation} Nxb8 {take the bishop} 13. Bc4 {got to open my white bishop} a5 {not very smart she should bring the knight or open the bishop before I come down with the queen and show her a lesson} 14. O-O {Castle got to be safe} h5 {She is just racing them down the line with no protection} 15. Qd2 {Aie!!!! here comes the queen} Rh6 {trying to open the rook to late for that} 16. Qxa5 {Queen takes a pawn down the line but better yet gets greater position} Rd6 {rook trying to get the middle but why doesn't she worry about her king} 17. Qc7 {I need to get the queen into position treating mate on D7 and attacking the knight} Rf6 {!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!She pulls the rook out of the way} 18. Qc8# {I wonder why I went there..............just kidding it's mate.........lol}
