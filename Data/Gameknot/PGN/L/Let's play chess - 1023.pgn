1. e4 {Smothered Mate - another useful tactic  e4 a standard classical opening} e5 {e5 - the best move available if you are ging for the classical opening} 2. Nf3 {Nf3 - the best move you could do with your g1 Knight} Nc6 {A good reply} 3. Bc4 {not uncommon.} Nd4 {Nd4? leaves the e5 pawn open} 4. Nxe5 {what else would you do?} Qg5 {another seemingly stupid move} 5. Nxf7 {again, what else would you do?} Qxg2 6. Rf1 {obviously, since White has trapped Black's rook, you'd get your rook to safety first} Qxe4+ {Check! } 7. Be2 {unless you want your queen to be taken, that's what you'd do} Nf3# {Mate! another beautiful tactic}
