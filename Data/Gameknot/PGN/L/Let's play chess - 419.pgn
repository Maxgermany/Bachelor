[Opening "French (C13), classical, Anderssen-Richter variation"]

1. e4 e6 {This is the French Defence. Few Grandmasters play it regularly, but at amateur level, it is a great opening. The strategic ideas are simple if you known them. In many variations, the position becomes closed, which might not be such a good idea against a weaker opponent.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 {White plays the traditional line so far.} Be7 5. Bxf6 {But now comes the big surprise! More common is 5. e5 Nd7 and 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 O-O or the gambit line 6. h4 Bxg5 7. hxg5 Qxg5. White is giving up the bishop pair for nothing.} Bxf6 {Here I actually thought about 5...gxf6 increasing control of the centre and opening up the g-file for the rook, but 6. exd5 exd5 looks too ugly.} 6. Nf3 {This is fine. After 6. e5 I had planned 6...Bg5 and then if 7. Nf3 Bh6. } O-O {Keeping it simple. I cannot do anything to prevent e5 kicking the bishop back. 6...dxe4 7. Nxe4 is not any better. Since I probably will castle kingside anyway, this is the least commiting developing move.} 7. e5 {Here it comes!} Be7 {And this is practically forced, since I do not want to lose my better bishop.} 8. Bd3 {This is logical and looks a bit intimidating, but as far as my bishop protects g5, there are no nasty sacrifices beginning with Bxh7+.} Nd7 {I want to play the thematic break move c5 at some point, so Nc6 would be wrong. In addition, I might need the knight's support on the kingside.} 9. O-O {Still simple developing moves.} c5 {Now I take advantage of the fact that White cannot protect d4 with a pawn. This will seriously undermine White's pawn centre. This is also the move that any French player knows by heart.} 10. Ne2 {Over-protecting d4 and making c3 possible.} cxd4 {I take before it is too late. Usually Black wants to keep the tension in the centre as long as possible, but now c3, protecting d4, was the strategic threat.} 11. Nexd4 {Forced.} a6 {This was probably not strictly necessary, but I wanted to rule out the possibility of Nd4-b5-d6 manouver.} 12. Re1 {At the moment, the rook is only protecting the e-pawn. Later, if I want to play the other break move f6, White will exchange at f6, after which the rook will aim at the e6-pawn. Combined with the knight on d4, this practically prevents the f6-idea.} Qb6 {Since I cannot easily develop other pieces, the queen might do something useful and give room for the rook on the back rank.} 13. Rb1 {Simple and effective.} Nc5 {Since there is no hope of getting rid of the e5-pawn, the knight does not have to pressure that square. Hitting the strong-looking bishop is the idea here. White either retreats the bishop or allows it to be exchanged with the knight.} 14. h3 {To me, this seems like a do-nothing move. White does nothing about the bishop, and that's ok, I think. The bishop pair is gone already, and the bishop does not do much. But still I would have expected something more active.} Bd7 {I use the extra tempo to develop a bishop. Although the (French) bishop's range of motion is very limited, now the rooks are free to move on the back rank.} 15. c3 {This is practical. It protects the d4-knight once again and gives the bishop the c2-square.} Nxd3 {I do not want to see the bishop and queen line up on the b1-h7 diagonal, so I make the exchange. Also something like Bc2 and b4 would have been very annoying. In addition, White has the space advantage, so exchanging makes my position less cramped.} 16. Qxd3 {Forced.} Rfc8 {I decided it was time to put the rooks where they belong to. At this point, it is useful to stop and think about the future. I have the bishop pair, but while the position is closed, it is really not an advantage. My goal is to open the position a bit to make the bishops stronger. On the other hand, I probably want to make my moves on the queenside, while White is more interested in attacking on the kingside. This is dictated by the central pawn structure. White's ideas may involve Ng5 threatening h7-square. I want to answer this with g6. This leaves the dark square a bit weak, but since White's dark-squared bishop is off the board, that does not matter so much. Now that a moved the rook out of the f8-square, the bishop can back up there, giving the king adequate protection for the time being. At the same time, I discard any ideas involving f6 or f5, since that would weaken my king's position too much while my other pieces are on the queenside. But White's rook on e1 and knight on d4 make such ideas risky anyway. Basically, what I want to do next is proceed with pawns on the queenside. After I move my queen away, b5-advance is obvious. After preparation, I can think about b4. If I can then exchange two pair of pawns on the queenside, it should be possible to pressure on the last White pawn and perhaps win it. In that case, the d5-pawn will guarantee the win for me.} 17. Nh2 {OK. White is preparing a kingside attack, but the knight goes to a different square. If White can induce Black to play g6, then the knight has f6 and h6 squares.} Qc7 {Following the plan.} 18. Re3 {White does a rook lift. Rf3 and Rg3 are now possible, but it is not clear, what does that do for White. Black bishops can always retreat to the back rank and cover the vital squares in front of the king.} b5 {So there is no reason to change the plan. Next, some preparation is needed for further pawn pushes.} 19. a3 {This move is apparently designed to stop the b-pawn. White might even play b4 next. That does not matter, since I will play Rb8 and a5 in most variations anyway. While White is trying to stop Black's ideas, the initiative is given to Black.} Rab8 {Implementing the plan. Now b4 is the likely response.} 20. Ng4 {The knight goes were I expected.} a5 {I follow my plan and prepare b4.} 21. Rg3 {Now I am becoming a little worried, since the knight can check at f6 or h6 and Black cannot take with the pinned g-pawn. If the king moves f7 or h7 squares become weak. If it does not move, I have to decide how to respond to the knight check.} g6 {This is what I decided to do the get rid of the pin. Perhaps 21...Kh8 was still better.} 22. h4 {The idea is simply to push the pawn and exchange on g6. The pawn is en prise, but taking it would open the h-file for the rook. A computer would probably take the pawn.} h5 {But I don't. Actually, I this this move deserves a question mark. I was calculating variations starting with 23. Nf6+, but forgot that 23. Nh6+ Kg7 24. Nxf7! destroys the shield in front of the king and 24...Kxf7 25. Qxg6+ Kf8 26. Qg8#. If I had not moved the h-pawn, the Nxf7-sacrifice would have not worked.} 23. Nh6+ {Here I see the Nxf7-trick.} Kh7 {I am forced to give up a pawn to avoid getting mated. I think any other move loses.} 24. Nxf7 {White gets to play Nxf7 anyway, but without the sacrificial aspect. But a pawn is a pawn.} Rcg8 {Protecting the vital square g6.} 25. Qe3 {White creates a new threat: Qh6#.} Bf8 {This covers the h6-square.} 26. Nf3 {Another knight is transferred to a better attacking position. I am calculating what to do after Ng5+, and think I can escape.} Bc8 {This is a mistake, but the position is lost anyway.} 27. Nf3g5+ {The knight check I was expecting.} Kg7 {The only move.} 28. Qf4 {Threatening Qf6#.} Be7 {Covering f6.} 29. Rf3 {More attacking power.} Qc4 {I try to exchange the queens to release the pressure.} 30. Nxe6+ {But fail to see this. Now 30...Bxe6 31. Qh6#. There is nothing I can do about it, so I resign.}
