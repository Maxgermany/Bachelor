1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 3. Nxe5 {Willing to sacrifice night in order to disrupt King side pawn structure} Qe7 4. Nf3 d5 5. d3 dxe4 6. dxe4 {I got the feeling that black was playing agressive so I played the next few moves carefully.} Qxe4+ {Black regains his pawn.  I believe this was a mistake given the black queen's retreat allowed me to develop my knights with Nc3 and then Nd4} 7. Be2 Ne7 8. Nc3 Qe6 9. Nd4 Qd7 10. O-O {I am prepared to handle anything black throws at me and then some.} Nbc6 11. Be3 Ng6 12. Bh5 {Black Kings Knight was dangerous to me, and I felt my light-squared bishop was expendable, so I was willing to keep him pinned for now.  This also relieved pressure on the e5 square.} a6 13. Qe2 {Starting to take advantage of the e-file.} Nce7 14. Rfe1 c6 15. Rad1 {Putting black's queen in danger} Nd5 {The turning point of the game, where black exposes his King to me.} 16. Bf4+ Be7 17. Ne4 Ndxf4 {Not intending to give up this bishop.  I consider this my first and only blunder. Black would not be able to take advantage as my superior knight development proved later.} 18. Qf3 Qc7 19. Ng3 {Worried now that black wanted to trade queens.} Bd7 20. Ndf5 Bxf5 {I beieve Black should have casled on queen side here instead of trading} 21. Nxf5 {Black might be thinking I would start trading more pieces but I had other plans in mind. } Nd5 {Black stacking up to defend e7} 22. Nxg7+ {Look at what spaces the knight has access to this move and next..Black has very few options to defend against this attack.  } Kf8 23. Ne6+ Kg8 24. Nxc7 Nxc7 {Two white knighs for a black bishiop, pawn and queen.  Favorable position for white.} 25. Rxe7 {}
