[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03)"]

1. e4 Nf6 {I play this primarily for practice: It's a defense I have not really studied, but it appeals to me.} 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 g6 4. Nf3 Nc6 {Here Black goes off-book.  The idea is to speed development but the actual effect is to give White a tempo and an attack.} 5. Bc4 Nb6 6. Bb5 Bg7 7. Bxc6 dxc6 {An oddly developed position.  White has advanced pawns which largely negate the fiancetto, and Black's remaining knight is poorly placed to contest the center.} 8. Bf4 O-O 9. c3 Bf5 {Bg4 might be more effective.} 10. Nbd2 Nd5 11. Bg3 e6 {White's pawns must be blocked, but the white bishop is now cut off.  For the remainder of the game Black is trying to get his bishops into play and develop some sort of attack.} 12. O-O Qd7 13. Ng5 b6 14. f4 f6 15. Nge4 Bxe4 16. Nxe4 {The bishop is successfully traded off and Black begins to open his position.} Qe7 17. Rf3 f5 {Neglecting the obvious freeing fxe5 in favor of the vaporous attack on the knight.} 18. Ng5 Rad8 19. Bh4 Nf6 {A straight up terrible mistake.} 20. exf6 Bxf6 21. Qe2 Rd6 22. Re1 Re8 23. g3 h6 24. Nh3 Bxh4 25. gxh4 {Trying to redeem the position, but continuing to exchange was perhaps misguided.} Qxh4 26. Rg3 Qf6 27. Qg2 Kg7 28. Nf2 Rg8 {In retrospect, I fail to understand this move.} 29. Nd3 Kf8 30. Ne5 Ke8 31. Nxg6 Kd8 32. Ne5 Rxg3 33. Qxg3 Kc8 34. Nc4 Rd7 35. Qf3 Kb7 36. Ne5 {Black's idea is to try counter-play on the Queen-side, but White's Queen has superior control on the board.} Rg7+ 37. Kh1 Kb8 38. Nxc6+ Ka8 39. Na5+ {Black resigns.  Positional weakness was exacerbated by poor play.}
