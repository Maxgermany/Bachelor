[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange, Alekhine variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5 Qd4 {Normal Ruy-Lopez Exchange Variation stuff:} 6. Nxf7 {Here Black takes me by surprise as he prefers to give up his N for a single p & perhaps a slightly exposed K. Better was 3.Nd3  } Kxf7 {I think slightly better was to insert 6....,Qxe4  & then follow it up with 7...,Kxf7, picking the N. Anyway one always learns by experience...} 7. Qf3+ Nf6 8. O-O Qxe4 {white plays daringly; dropping his pieces & ps} 9. Qb3+ {This check doesnt scare black as he can easily block it with} Qe6 {Probably white accepted ...,Be6?! giving scope for Qxb7} 10. Qf3 Bc5 {Completes his K-side development & gets ready for his K to transfer to g-file after ....,Rf8} 11. Nc3 Rf8 12. d3 Kg8 13. Bf4 {This aims at blacks c7-p but Iam in no mood to drops this p & so plays} Qf7 {defends the p & now threatens ....,Nh5 when white has to make a choice between B retreat or posting it on f4} 14. g3 {prefers to place the B on f4 rather than allow Q swap} Nh5 15. Ne2 {Anyway the position is beyond repair} Nxf4 16. Nxf4 g5 {The pin is horrible as either of his Q or N drops. With 2 piece down white decides to call off.}
