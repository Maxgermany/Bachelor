1. e4 {This is a game I played recently. I should have won but didn't play it right. This shows how not to win a Bishop V knight ending when you have the bishop. I hope you can learn from my mistakes. I know I have.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Interesting as although solid Phildor's defence is rarely seen at GM level because it usually leads to cramped and pasive positions for black} 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {The mainline} a6 {Preparing Nc6 because if ...Nc6 Bb5 a6 Nxc6 Bxc6! wins the rook} 5. Nc3 h6 {?! Preparing another Knight development but there was no real threat because Bg5 is met with Be7} 6. Bc4 {White has three pieces developed while black has only moved pawns} Nf6 {Finally some devlopment. Can White make is superior development turn into an attack?} 7. O-O {Some may see it as to slow but I recently was reading an annotation and a player rated over 2200 suggested even if your opponent has played substandard moves that you should still make sure your king is safe just to get into good habits} Bd7 {I Like Be7 because it prepares O-O} 8. a4 {I wanted to attack the queenside but the computer says my advantage moves from 1.27-1.05} Nc6 9. Be3 Nxd4 10. Bxd4 {Now my advantage goes back to over 1 but I see no extra factor apart from Position and king safety.} Be7 11. b4 {Now my advantage is less than half a point but I wanted to open up the Queenside and use my better placed pieces to attack} c6 12. b5 axb5 13. axb5 cxb5 {The computer says I now have a 1.21 advantage} 14. Rxa8 Qxa8 15. Bxb5 {The computer suggested Bxf6} Bxb5 16. Nxb5 {I now threaten Nc7 a royal fork} Qd8 17. e5 dxe5 18. Bxe5 {I decide to exchange looking for a bishop v Knight endgame. The only risk is that His king is centralized and that may turn out to be an advantage. But if I get the d-file I keep the king from the queenside which is where the pawns will determine the victor} Qxd1 19. Rxd1 O-O {Better late than never. } 20. Nd6 {However my advantage is now only .25 despite seeming to trade into a Bishop v Knight endgame where I have the bishop} Ng4 {Trying to put the pressure on me} 21. Bf4 Bxd6 {?! I would have kept my bishop if I was my opponent} 22. Bxd6 Rd8 {Expected } 23. c4 b6 24. f4 h5 25. h3 Nh6 {The computer gives the last four moves as mistakes and inaccuracies} 26. Rd5 f6 27. Bc7 {Now This is when my Bishop will show its worth} Rxd5 28. cxd5 b5 {Now my passed pawn is advanced and my Bishop is the right colour} 29. Bd6 Nf5 30. Bc5 Kf7 31. Kf2 {Moving towards the center although When he gets to e8 I plan to attack down the K-SIDE} Ke8 32. Kf3 Kd7 33. g4 hxg4+ 34. hxg4 Nd6 35. g5 {Now I offer to exchange pawns and get my King to win the game by attacking the pawns} f5 {Trying to close the positions} 36. Ke3 Ne4 37. Bb4 g6 {The pawns have closed the K-Side and now his Knight threatend to attack them as my Pawns block my bishops} 38. Kd4 Nd6 39. Ke5 Ne8 40. d6 {Now My d-pawn keeps the king in place} Ng7 41. Kd5 Nh5 42. Ke5 Ng3 43. Kf6 Ne4+ {These last few moves have been trying to open the kingside} 44. Ke5 Ng3 45. Kd5 Ne2 46. Ke5 Ng3 47. Kf6 Nh5+ {Now the k-side will be open} 48. Kxg6 Nxf4+ 49. Kxf5 Nd5 {Now you can see my mistake} 50. Ba3 {?? This draws the game. Better was g6 which means I will queen and win} b4 51. Bxb4 Nxb4 52. g6 Kxd6 53. g7 Nc6 {Threatens Ne7 if I queen which is a royal fork} 54. Kf6 Ne7 55. Kf7 Kd7 56. Kf8 Ke6 {Now begin to enter into a position for threefold however I offer a draw soon he declines despite the fact he can't win} 57. Ke8 Kf6 58. Kf8 Ke6 59. Ke8 Kf6 60. Kf8 Ke6 {also repeated thrice} 61. Ke8 Kf6 {This has repeated thrice} 62. Kf8 Ke6 {Now I call it in I thought he make a mistake but we draw.  I hope this shows how to win a Knight v Bishop endgame. Please try and learn from my mistakes and make sure my mistakes don't become yours.  Here is the link to the computer anylasis http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15817169&rnd=0.5222205501049757}
