1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bb5 Qb6 6. Bxc6+ bxc6 7. O-O cxd4 8. Nxd4 c5 9. Nf3 Ne7 10. b3 Ng6 11. Nc3 Be7 12. Na4 Qc7 13. Re1 O-O 14. Bb2 Ba6 15. Qc1 Rab8 16. Nd2 Rb4 {I thought he moved that Rook down so he could run it over to the other side for an attack. } 17. Re3 Bg5 18. Rc3 {Next he should move the Pawn to d4 chasing my Rook away. I intended to go chase his Bishop away if he did that. } c4 {This will prove to be a mistake. It loses the game! Before this move I was wondering if I would hold this to a draw. Now he has opened up some juicy lines of attack for me.} 19. Ba3 {Now his attack might just fall apart! I see no way he can avoid losing material from here and he will probably also come out in a terrible position.} Qb7 {I could trade my Bishop for his Rook, but since I may be able to force his moves, I may be able to do even better than that.} 20. Nc5 Qb6 21. Nxa6 {I am happy to get rid of the Bishop that was on that dangerous (for me) diagonal.} Nf4 {Whoops! a serious threat of a fork at e2.} 22. Qe1 {That ends his threat without relieving any of his pieces from attack.} Rb5 23. Bxf8 {Now he has to choose whether to take the Knight or the Bishop. } Qxa6 {I think he would have been better taking the Bishop with the King because the Knight could not be saved anyway. It had nowhere to escape and he would have ended up taking both the Knight and Bishop. Now I can save the Bishop.} 24. bxc4 Rb7 25. Bd6 d4 26. Rb3 Rd7 27. Rb8+ Rd8 28. Rab1 h6 29. Bc7 Rxb8 30. Bxb8 Kh7 31. Bd6 Qc6 {He threatens mate at g2 with that Queen.} 32. Qe4+ {But, he gave me the chance to force a trade of Queens. When he is down material, that is not a good thing to do.} Qxe4 33. Nxe4 Bd8 34. g3 {His attacking possibilities are seriously diminshed now, but that Knight is in a place that could cause me trouble, so I will drive him back. If he checks with the Knight I can force a trade for my Knight, so he needs to just retreat.} Ng6 35. c5 Be7 36. Rb7 Bxd6 37. cxd6 Nxe5 38. d7 {With no hope left Black resigns.}
