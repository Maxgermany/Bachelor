1. e4 {Standard opening for white.} g6 {Opening flank move for black, preparing for fianchetto and kingside castle.} 2. d4 {White stakes his claim to the centre.} Bg7 {The fianchetto.} 3. Nf3 {White continues his development and covers his D-pawn.} Nh6 {Clear way for castling.} 4. Bc4 {White now threatens my F-pawn, so next move guards against anticipated Kg5.} e6 5. O-O {White castles.} O-O {My reply.} 6. Nc3 {White continues to develop his pieces - time to develop my own Queenside.} b6 {Another flank opening, made necessary by blocked c8-h3 diagonal.  } 7. Bxh6 {First blood to White, offering exchange of Knight for Bishop.} Bxh6 {The exchange.} 8. Qe2 {White's Queen now forms battery with his bishop, limiting my white square bishop and knight.} Bb7 {Second finachetto.  A good way to avoid a "bad" bishop.} 9. d5 {White bids to open up the centre, and block my bishop.} exd5 10. exd5 Re8 {The E-file opened, I seek to dislodge his Queen.} 11. Qd3 d6 {Blocking a possible advance by the D-pawn.} 12. a4 {White's threat with his A-pawn is met in kind...} a5 13. Rae1 {Rook vs rook - should I exchange here?  I decide to open up a new line of attack on the Queenside flank. } Ba6 {My Bishop is supported by the Rook and Knight, and threatens his Queen and Rook whilst pinning his Bishop. } 14. Rxe8+ {White exchanges Rooks.} Qxe8 15. Re1 Qd8 16. Bxa6 {Now to decide whether to re-take with Rook or Knight.  Knight needs to develop, and connecting Queen and Rook makes more sense.} Nxa6 17. Nd4 {Whites Knight moves into the centre - his domination of the board seems to be increasing.} Nc5 {A move inteded to dislodge his Queen from the central area.  Unfortunately...} 18. Qb5 {White now threatens to invade the back rank with his Rook and Knights  in support.   I have to consider whether to tackle the threat from his Queen directly or pursue another plan.   Here I notice his King may be vulnerable to a back rank mate,  if only his Queen and Rook could persuaded (or enticed) to move.} Qg5 {Anticipating White's most likely attack sequence from here, I move my Queen to a potential attcking diagonal and wait.  My King now sits as the bait in the trap.} 19. Re8+ {Rook forks King and Rook.  Only one realistic response...} Rxe8 {Now for his Queen...} 20. Qxe8+ {White carries his attack forward without noticing the glaring hole in his defence.  } Bf8 {If white checks the entire board at this point, I may well lose the game.  Fortunately, he continues with...} 21. Ncb5 Qc1+ {White's fate is sealed.  The back door is wide open, and too late to prevent mate.} 22. Qe1 {White conceded defeat before this move, but allowed me the honour of the mate.   The moral of this game?   Don't concentrate so much on attack that you neglect your King's defence.} Qxe1# {This game is most memorable for me because I can't quite beleive I got away with it.  It seemed to make an impression on my opponent too, as the rematch was a much tougher affair (I lost).}
