Qb4 followed by Qc5 and Nbd7.} 15. Nf4 Nc5 {! It defends g4 and attacks e4.} 16. Nfd5 {? I think White should have played something like Qe2 to defend the e4 pawn.} Nxd5 17. Nxd5 Qd8 {And now both the e4 and b2 pawns are attacked. Black is already in big advantage.} 18. c3 Nxe4 19. O-O Nxg3 20. fxg3 e6 21. Nf4 d5 22. Nh5 f5 23. Nxg7 Kxg7 {After the exchange of White's most active piece, Black has no problem in capitalizing his advantage.} 24. Kh2 Qf6 {Avoiding a future Qd4.} 25. Qd3 Bd7 26. Bc2 {?? A blunder in a really bad position.} Bb5 {}
