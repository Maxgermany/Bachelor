[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 d5 {Closed Game} 2. e3 {White opens passage for his bishop to be able to put me in check at some point.} Bd7 {Serves the dual purpose of developing the bishop and preventing white's ability to make the move previously mentioned.} 3. Nf3 {White strengthens the middle with this move.} e6 {Let both my bishop and my queen a way out.} 4. c4 {A gambit, perhaps, to move my pawn away from the center and further his control over the center.} dxc4 {I accept the gambit.} 5. Bxc4 {White takes. This move was perhaps not the best, because...} b5 6. Bb3 {...the bishop is forced away easily.} Nc6 7. Nc3 {White is now behind a turn. I develop my knight and he responds in kind.} Bb4 {I've pinned his knight. Alas, he can easily escape the pin...} 8. O-O {...by castling.} Nf6 {Moving my knight out of the way for a castling of my own.} 9. Bd2 {He develops his other bishop and protects a few of his pieces.} O-O {Castle.} 10. e4 {Further strengthening of the center, knowing that I can't take either pawn because of his knights awaiting to avenge.} Re8 {Backing my own pawn with the rook, as it will move up at some point.} 11. a3 {He attempts to force my bishop back, however, I'd rather take out his knight at this point in exchange for my bishop, as the knights are currently more of an obstacle than my bishop is worth.} Bxc3 12. bxc3 {The exchange thusly.} Rb8 {Backing of another pawn with a rook for a chance to move up. I missed the chance of a better move of NxE4, because the pawn at this point is entirely unprotected.} 13. Bc2 {White also sees this, and protects his pawn.} Na5 {I lock his bishop from going back. While this knight can't do much in the corner, my pieces can't breathe as it is.} 14. e5 {An attempt to attack my other knight, however it is an effort in futility. His move allowed Nd5 to be safe, and results in a weakening of control of the center for him. Ah, but that's not white's plan at all, is it? Ponder Nd5 Bg5. His plan was to attack my queen, and I cannot take the assailant because of the knight protecting it.} Nd5 15. Bg5 {I let it happen anyway...} f6 {...because he can easily be blocked. He now has to move away...} 16. exf6 gxf6 {...or trade pawns and then move away...} 17. Qd3 {...or lose his bishop. That works too. A better move would have been Bh6, which would have allowed him to move his queen in and put my king in a corner. Instead...} fxg5 18. Qd2 {...and now he is behind in terms of development and material. Even his strong control of the center in the beginning of the game has dissipated.} Nc4 {Attacking his queen from a safe place...} 19. Qd3 {..because I know that he can't take it. The pawn backs the knight, preventing his queen from doing any damage.} Qf6 {I finally develop my own queen, after a long period of waiting.} 20. Qxh7+ {White then tries a daring, but very risky attempt at attacking my king, backed by his bishop. It's all well and good, except this results in a likely loss of queen.} Kf8 {That bishop looks very appetizing. But it's a trap. The best move here would be to either retreat with the attack, or at least attack the bishop more elegantly with Ne5. While this results in a loss of knight, it's the extra knight that loses his queen. This also results in me moving my queen further from the action, leaving his queen to then gobble up the bishop without worry.} 21. Qxd7 Na5 {This is what locks him in. If he wants his queen to survive at this point, he needs to move it back where it was. Any other move results in the loss of his queen.} 22. Be4 {He attempts to attack my other knight, but that just seals his fate...} Re7 {...as I've now forced him into a trade for his queen. The knights protect the pawns c7 and a7, the rook at e7, and also prevents movement to the squares b6, c6, and b7. The pawn c7 protects the square d6, the pawn e6 protects the knight, the rook at b8 protects the pawn at b5, and finally the entire 8th row. His only way to save face is to take the rook...} 23. Qxe7+ {...which he at least does.} Nxe7 {Yoink!} 24. Rfe1 {Once his attack has run out of steam, The next few moves deal with driving him back.} c6 25. Bd3 Nd5 26. Rac1 {At this point, he protects his pawn, otherwise I would have taken it.} g4 {What looks like an attack of his knight is actually...} 27. Ne5 g3 {...what some would consider a bit of an odd choice. What I'm doing is forcing him to remove the stalwart choke that white has on the e file. He either has to take the pawn, which blocks one pawn and fizzles the protection on the right side.} 28. fxg3 {He takes the offered material.} Qg5 {Now, it's a losing battle for him as he struggles to keep me from collapsing in on him. He still attempts to continue what is now a pointless attack...} 29. Nd7+ {...with the only piece near my king and no protection. Of course, you could say that he's trying to even the odds by forcing a take on the other rook, but with its position, it's way less important than the other pieces.} Ke7 30. Nxb8 {And he takes the rook. His knight is now in the same useless position that my rook was in. You are what you eat, I suppose.} Ne3 {Continuing the pressure on his king.} 31. Na6 {He's still moving his knight, but its of no use in the corner.} Nb3 {Now he has to move his rook, because he knows that I'll gladly trade...} 32. Nb4 {...or perhaps he doesn't.} Nxc1 33. Rxc1 {He's now in the most horrid of positions, nearly all of which end in a checkmate. Once I move my knight out of the way, that opens for a loss of rook and a check in one swoop.} Nd5 34. Nxc6+ {Oddly enough, he still attempts to attack my king, perhaps to stall for a better shot at defending himself. Alas...} Kd6 {...easily rectified...} 35. Nxa7 {...back in the corner you go!} Qxc1+ {At this point, he's toast. Not only does he have less material than me, it's only in pawns, a bishop, and a knight. On top of it, his king is on the run.} 36. Bf1 {He blocks with his bishop...} Qe3+ {...but that only prolongs the inevitable.} 37. Kh1 Nxc3 {A good chance to gobble up a pawn.} 38. g4 {Perhaps an attempt to distract me into addressing the possible promotion? I ignore it...} Qe1 {...because now that my knight is in close proximity, he has nowhere to go.} 39. Kg1 {This move causes mate in two. For those in which it is not obvious, figure the move Ne2+. He can't take the knight with his bishop, because of the queen that pins him there. He can really only move it back...} Ne2+ 40. Kh1 Qxf1# {...which leads to the checkmate.}
