1. e4 {This was my first completed game after a break from Gameknot. I also had an agenda, to break the elusive 1800 barrier (I was on 1799). } c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {The first time for a while I have faced up to the Yugoslav Attack, as I don't have my books with me where I am living in Kazakhstan.} 6. Be3 {Here goes.} Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O d5 {The first time I have played this variation, as white has some drawing lines a bit further down the road.} 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nxc6 bxc6 {Now exchanging on d5 often leads to a draw.  I was pleased that white did not take it.} 12. Bd4 e5 {No way he is having my Dragon bishop.} 13. Bc5 Re8 14. Bc4 {Piling up a bit of pressure, but white is also leaving a few loose pieces.} Qa5 15. Ne4 Qc7 {Hoping to capitalize if white opened the c-file.} 16. Qf2 {I wasn't sure about this move.  It protects the bishop, but takes away a bit of pressure from the d-file, and opens the c1-h6 diagonal.} Rd8 17. Kb1 {Getting off the aforementioned diagonal.  White usually plays this move earlier, I think.} Be6 {Planning a discovered attack on the Bc4.} 18. a3 {White may have thought I was planning ..Nb4, but actually it was Nc3+ I had in mind.} f5 {First I needed to kick that knight away, so that ..Nc3+ would smash white's pawn structure.} 19. Ng5 {Threatening but too late to take the bishop.} Nc3+ 20. bxc3 Bxc4 {Now the bishop is away.} 21. Ka1 {Getting out of the way.  White's defenses look open, but I need a plan.  The key defensive piece is black's dark-squared bishop, and the obvious place for it is b4. I could interdict b4 by ..a5,*  but decided instead to force it there and then drive it away with tempo.  *After ..a5,  black also has to watch Bb6. } h6 {Driving the knight away as I might want to play  ..e4.} 22. Nh3 Qa5 23. Bb4 Qa4 24. Rdb1 {A natural precautiion, but abandoning the d-file.  The threat now (after ..e4) is ..Bxc3.  White cannot recapture because of ..Qxa3#. } e4 25. Qe3 {Moving to cover c3, but black has a resource.} a5 {Driving the bishop away as planned.} 26. Be7 {Aggressive, but that rook wasn't staying there anyway.} Rd3 {The decisive move - I thought the game was won now.  But was there a good reply for white, apart from taking the rook?} 27. cxd3 Bxc3+ 28. Rb2 Bxb2+ {Always sad to lose the Dragon bishop, but now it is the other bishop that counts.} 29. Kxb2 Qb3+ 30. Kc1 Bxd3 31. Kd2 Qc2+ 32. Ke1 Rb8 33. Nf2 {I thought Bb4 might be tried as a delaying move.} Rb1+ 34. Nd1 {White courteously allows me to play out the mate.} Rxd1# {}
