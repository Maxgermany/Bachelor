1. e4 {My usual king's pawn openning.} c5 {Replies with sicilian openning.} 2. Nf3 {Keep on Still Sicilian Najdorf development.} d6 {Still Sicilian Najdorf.} 3. d4 {I follow the Najdorf pawn advance variation.} cxd4 {Captures.} 4. Nxd4 {Recapture.} Nf6 {Attacks my pawn.} 5. Nc3 {Defend my pawn.} a6 {Blocks Bb5+.} 6. Bd3 {I develop Bishop to d3 to reinforce the pawn and lure the enemy to bring out his knight to c6.} e5 {Plays to move my knight.} 7. Nf5 {I decide I will open the center e file.} Bxf5 {Captures.} 8. exf5 {Recapture.} Nc6 {Develops knight.} 9. Bg5 {Pin his knight.} Be7 {Unpins his knight and develops bishop to castle.} 10. O-O {I castle.} O-O {So he does.} 11. a3 {I prevent his knight from going to b4 to attack my bishop.} Rc8 {He's gonna start adding pressure on the c file.} 12. h3 {I don't want no nasty surprises when he discovers an attack on my bishop by moving out his knight.} e4 {The show will begin. He advances the pawn to start pushing me back.} 13. Bxf6 {If I take that pawn I might get into a worse position. So I decide I'll go on the diagonal.} exd3 {He takes the bishop. Still even in the exchanges.} 14. Bxe7 {I take the knight.} Qxe7 {He takes with the queen. Maybe he should have taken the pawn. I'd be forced to capture the pawn first, and then he could recapture my bishop.} 15. Qxd3 {I capture the pawn and get myself a pawn advantage.} Ne5 {He attacks my queen.} 16. Nd5 {I ignore his attack, I can do the same while forking also his king and rock. So I go for it. He'd better not take my queen.} Qd8 {Puts his queen in a safe place.} 17. Qb3 {So do I, while also attacking b pawn.} b5 {Defends b-pawn.} 18. f4 {I force his knight out of that position.} Nc4 {Moves knight to c4, with the idea of Nd2 next.} 19. Rae1 {I say I'm okay with that, I can also force a fork and lose no time in preventing his.} Nd2 {Fork.} 20. Qd3 {I save my queen.} Nxf1 {Captures rock.} 21. Ne7+ {I play my own absolute fork before I recapture his knight.} Kh8 {He has no choice but to move.} 22. Nxc8 {I capture his rock. Keeping my pawn advantage. His knight can't excape to any place, so he is forced to capture mine.} Qxc8 {He captures my knight.} 23. Kxf1 {I recapture his.} Qc7 {He plans to do a battery attack over my c pawn. And also prepares a discovered attack on my f pawn.} 24. g3 {I protect the pawn.} Rd8 {He prevents a battery attack of my own over his d pawn.} 25. c3 {I advance c pawn to eliminate his chances to battery attack him.} Qc6 {Menacing Qh8+, followed by Re8, and all sort of nasty things there for me.} 26. Qe4 {Can't allow it. So I block it while also menacing back-rank mate in e8 if he takes his queen out of that diagonal.} d5 {He blocks my attack on his queen.} 27. Qe7 {I come to e7, menacing mate when capturing his rock. He'll have to either move it or protect it.} Qc4+ {An in-between move I hadn't calculated. But it's useless. I can block that check and any further with this position.} 28. Re2 {So I block it.} Rc8 {He puts his rock in safety.} 29. Qxf7 {I can't do Qe8+ coz my rock is pinned and I'll lose my queen and rock to nothing. So I decide it's time for me to demolish his defensive pawns.} Qd3 {He wants to come to f3 to check me and start forcing perpetual checks on me.} 30. Kf2 {With this, I've just prevented the check and unpinned my rock for backrank mate if he doesn't keep me from it (30. Re8+ Rxe8 31. Qxe8#)} Rg8 {So, he has to save his rock so it's not forced to init the exchanges.} 31. f6 {I advance the pawn, the idea is 31. ... gxf6 32. Qxf6+ Rg7 33. Re8#. So he can't take the pawn. But also if he leaves it there, I follow with 32. fxg7+ Rxg7 33. Re8#...  Both of those work on the idea that his rock will be pinned against his king by my queen, coz he has no other ways to defend to such attacks. So, he's forced to play g6, leaving my f pawn free to advance to promotion.} g6 {Now I have a passed pawn at 6th rank... He's worth a queen right now.} 32. Qe8 {So I play a sacrifice. If he captures it, I recapture and mate. If he doesn't, I advance the pawn and then he's forced to take my queen or be mated right after, then I recapture with pawn promotion. He'll be in disadvantage by a rock, I can force queen exchanges, and that will be it... Maybe that's why he resigned.}
