1. e4 e5 2. c3 {Rather than play d4 and possibly wind up conceding an early center square. I played c3 to set up d4. } d5 3. d4 {After d4, the game would be more open. Early captures and counter movements would drive the action during the match. } dxe4 {My opponent seized the opportunity to claim my e4 pawn and establish himself on my half of the board. } 4. dxe5 {I understood that by playing dxe5, I was opening up my Q to be captured. I would be behind in the match due to my opponent having more of the initiative early on. } Qxd1+ 5. Kxd1 Bg4+ {My opponent again placed me in check early on forcing me to make concessions. I opted to block with f3. The piece itself would be easy for my opponent to deal with. } 6. f3 exf3 7. gxf3 {After gxf3, my K-side pawn structure was non-existent. } Bh5 8. Ne2 {Given a slight reprieve from the pressure, I would begin developing my minor pieces. Computer analysis indicates that Be2 was the best move in this scenario. Mainly, I can see that move having the advantage due to maintaining better coverage over the white diagonals early in the match. Additionally, it would provide protection to the f3 pawn. } Nc6 {Better play here from my opponent would have left me in a larger gap. He would have picked up the free pawn (f3) and set up a positioning on my R. } 9. Bg2 {The computer analysis indicates that f4 would have been the appropriate move in this situation. There was a clear threat to the piece and f4 would have provided protection to the hanging pawn. } O-O-O+ 10. Nd2 {My opponent castled long and I continued with development. } Nxe5 11. Nf4 {My opponent moves his N towards a more central location, controlling the center of the board. I opted to make a move against his LSB to remove it from its perch. } Nc4 {Computer analysis indicates that this move by my opponent, was a 3 pawn swing in my favor. The threats posed by his N are not an immediate worry. I would be able to play counter-moves and not give up any ground in material.  } 12. Re1 {The computer favored Bh3+. This would have led to a favorable line. The reasoning behind my movement of Re1 was to claim the open file. } Nf6 13. Kc2 Bg6+ 14. Kd1 Bc5 15. b3 Na5 16. Bh3+ {The computer says my best move here is b4 which I played next. } Kb8 17. b4 Bf2 18. Rf1 Be3 19. bxa5 {The computer favored me playing Nxg6, which was also the best move it preferred on the next line as well.} Rhe8 20. Re1 Bxf4 21. Rxe8 Rxe8 22. Nc4 Rd8+ 23. Ke2 Nh5 24. Bxf4 {According to computer analysis, I should have played Kf2. That was my next move. Either way, there was going to be a trade of B's. I was wanting to dictate the location vice wait for my opponent. } Nxf4+ 25. Kf2 Nxh3+ 26. Kg3 Bf5 27. Ne3 g6 {I assume my opponent thought I would not capture the B because of the pawn. However, help reduce my material disadvantage and alleviate some pressure. } 28. Nxf5 Ng5 29. Ne3 Rd3 30. Kg4 {Rd1 had crossed my mind, which the computer said was the best move. } h6 31. Rd1 Rxd1 32. Nxd1 {I am down a pawn in material but my structure is completely shattered. } f6 33. f4 f5+ 34. Kg3 Ne4+ 35. Kf3 {My opponent accepted a draw. }
