[Opening "Sicilian (B77), dragon, Yugoslav attack, 9.Bc4"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian. Love playing it as black. Love playing against it as White. :) } 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {This is my preferred position when combating the Sicilian, getting these knights to pair up early, with bishop development second. } g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 O-O {That's unusual for me, facing this kingside development and early castle from Black. Apparently it's called the Sicilian Dragon. That will leave Tipsy to slay the dragon! I'm enjoying the high tempo, aggressive development from both sides. } 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Bc4 {This is looking more like a King's Pawn/Four Knights/Making It Up As We Go opening than a Sicilian game. } Nxd4 {Yippee! Sharp variation! } 10. Bxd4 {Looking forward to 10...Qa5} a6 11. O-O-O b5 12. Bb3 Bb7 13. h4 {Black is living dangerously here I sense. White is gaining space, open diagonals and potential for devestating attack all over the place. Black, atm, is still on the database, perhaps they should stay there for a while....} b4 14. Na4 a5 15. h5 e6 {Finally off the database. And there's something about that move that screams glaring error to me. It all looks too dangerous for Black, like a pile of precariously stacked dishes or a teetering Jenga tower. Of course, unlike in Jenga, the object in chess is to find the one move (or move sequence) that brings it all crashing down.....} 16. Bb6 {Sadly, lacking super master vision, I find no immediate move sequence to topple Black's tower. Rather, White settles upon winning at least a pawn but with possibilities of more if Black fails to keep its cool as the temperature starts rising. No doubt in the aftermath GK computer will chastise me for not finding some complex, 15 move mating sequence. BUT, hell, win the game in 30, win it in 50. Long as you win! :) And winning a pawn is a good start! } Qd7 17. hxg6 {The d6 pawn is marked for death, but not without some hijinx first. Black must deal with the threats created by hxg6, so that I can capture d6 at my leisure. I believe Black has resigned itself to the loss of the pawn but perhaps they'll do something foolish like 17...Ne8?? to protect a pawn....and lose the game. At 1633 rating, I wouldn't expect that. Still, fun to try and in the meantime, Black's fortress is opened up. I do love chess! :D} fxg6 18. Qxd6 Qxd6 19. Rxd6 Kh8 {Okay so I get 2 pawns now. I'm sure Black could have avoided this fate and limited it to 1 pawn loss way back at 16. Bb6 but I've lost my lines and frankly, I don't care! What's behind is irrelevant, what's forward is victory for the Tipsy! :D} 20. Nc5 {I'll give Black one thing: at 19.... they realised their predicament and got that king off the g8 square. They are limiting further damage, but with such an open board and horrendous pawn structure, it will be left to the officers to take up the defensive roles. That's a job far better suited to infantry and it shouldn't be too hard from here to overwhelm Black from this position. } Rab8 {That seems like an utterly unfathomable move for a 1600. I could forgive a novice for the intuitive protection of the bishop with rook but a journeymen, tipsy or not, should do better. Just off the cuff it seems like Black will now lose not just a pawn but either several pawns or a pawn and a piece. } 21. Nxe6 Rfe8 {Mistake. Has everyone lost their ability to analyse simple tactics in open positions? Tipsy is feasting off some highly dubious middle games of late!} 22. Nxg7 Kxg7 23. Bd4 {So, Black can sac heavily to avoid mate and prolong the agony, be mated, or resign. Either way, this game is over. } Ref8 {Black does not sac and has chosen mate. As said earlier, it's all over. As said even earlier, Victory to the Tipsy! :)} 24. Rd7+ Kh8 25. Rhxh7# {I said much earlier in the piece Black was leaving itself vulnerable and though Black's commitment to constant attack is admirable, the Sicilian is not an defence which lends to such free-wheeling play. Should have tried the Latvian! :) And so the Dragon is slayed by the Tips and another Sicilian has been added to the ever-growing pile of corpses that is unsuccessful Sicilians played against the Tipsy. You don't get to love the KP and play it as your sole opening without learning how to dash aside the Sicilian! :D }
