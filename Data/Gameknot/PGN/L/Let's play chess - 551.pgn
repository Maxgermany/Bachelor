1. e4 {i do enjoy annotating the games that i won, there are many games that i lost, but i don't like to remember them, i think this is a human behaver and i think majority of people do the same, so expect to see me smiling with joy at the end of this game. disregard what i said and let us start : please note that i will use these abbreviations : N = knight B = bishop o-o or o-o-o = castling K = king Q = queen P = pawn R = rock  i like this starting move because it control the center and open the way to Q and B  } e5 {replay to my massage} 2.
