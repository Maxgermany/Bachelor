O-O c5 {Now the Houdini chess engine thinks white should play dxc5 Nxc5, Qc2 with a slightly bigger edge, but this is hard to understand why white has any advantage at all. } 10. Rc1 b6 {a6 preparing b5 is slightly better. } 11. Qe2 Bb7 12. Rfd1 {This is a pretty ordinary game up to this point. } Bxf3 {This move makes black's queenside weak therefore giving white the uppper hand. } 13. Qxf3 cxd4 14. exd4 Rc8 {Where is black's weakness? } 15. Ba6 {The rook is going to run out of places to hide. } Rb8 16. Bf4 e5 {A desperate attempt to save the rook, but everything falls appart for black now. } 17. dxe5 Ne8 18. Bb5 {Black loses at least a piece here and appears to be positionally crushed. }
