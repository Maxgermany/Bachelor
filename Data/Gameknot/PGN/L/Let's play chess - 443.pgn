1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c3 Nf6 4. Qe2 {Alternatively, you could have pushed the pawn which would force the knight to move again.  A great follow up would then be to defend the e5 pawn with Pd4, but black's pawn at c5 might result in a trade.  But your queen move here is probably better in the long run.} d5 5. d4 {Oh, here would have gone with Pe5 instead, because Pxe4 forces you to move your knight, and black wreaks more havoc with Pc5.} Nc6 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. Na3 Qf6 8. Nb5 {:)  Going for the king/rook fork.  Nice.} Bd6 {Parried.} 9. Nxd6+ {...or so black thought.  I don't know how I overlooked that obvious move--good job.  Hope you snag the bishop too.} Ke7 10. Nxc8+ {Right on!} Raxc8 {Oh!  Oh!  You've got his queen!  Bg5 pins the old biddy against the black king.  Sweet!} 11. Bg5 {Righteous!} Qxg5 {Yep.  Black is better off trading.} 12. Nxg5 f6 13. Qxe6+ {Nice move!  Press your advantage.} Kd8 {Oh, now fork the king and rook on the right side.} 14. O-O-O {WTH?  Weren't you listening?  Kf7+ gives you black's rook.  As a bonus you could even force the king out to b6, or pick off the undefended knight at d5 at your leisure.  Yeah, black was right to resign.}
