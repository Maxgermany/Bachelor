1. e4 {I'm annotating this game at the request of my opponent, nathanman22.  Although Black won this game, that result was an extremely lucky break.  Earlier, in the game I had been in great trouble... I'll try to keep the annotations thematic as far as possible - not too many long variations... Here goes (comments very welcome):} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {White is either aiming for a closed Sicilian or simply trying to cut out some overworked lines by delaying the pawn advance d4.  The plan makes Black think carefully since he doesn't yet know what kind of game will be played.} e6 4. Bc4 a6 {Trying to take advantage of the placement of the bishop on c4.  Because Black's c-pawn has not yet been exchanged for White's d-pawn (as in a normal open Sicilian), there is a potential threat of playing ...b5 and the white bishop can't retreat to its natural square b3 as it would then be trapped by the advance of Black's c-pawn.} 5. d4 {(?!) In order to address Black's threat of ...b5, 5. a4 was called for instead.} b5 {(!) As per the note to Black's fourth move, this is better than the immediate recapture of the pawn on d4.  The w-sq bishop is forced back to a much less active position.} 6. Be2 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Bb7 8. Be3 Nf6 {Threatening to win a pawn on the next move with the standard Sicilian mechanism ...b4 which kicks away the knight on c3 whose job it is to defend the e4 pawn.} 9. Qd2 {(?) The first (of many) mistakes in this game.  Something like 9.f3 would have defended the e-pawn.} b4 10. Na4 Nxe4 {So, Black is a pawn up out of the opening.  He must be careful, however, to complete his development now and not get greedy...} 11. Qd3 {(?!) Another reason why White's ninth move was a mistake is that Black captures the e-pawn with tempo, attacking White's Queen, which has to move again.  However, d3 was the wrong square to go to since it allows Black to defend his knight on e4 by opening the Bb7's diagonal at the same time as attacking White's queen - again.} Ne5 12. Qd1 {Heading back where she started but all these queen moves have allowed Black to get quite active quite quickly.  It's so important in the opening (which can be viewed as a race to be the first to get properly developed) not to allow your opponent too many of these "free" moves.} d5 {The knight on e4 is defended properly and Black gets his liberating ...d5 move with ease.} 13. Nf3 {It seems a shame to have to retreat the knight from its central point on d4 but the threat was ...Qa5 by Black, which would have attacked the knight on the edge of the board at a4 -- a piece which has nowhere to go.  By moving the other knight back to f3 White can answer ...Qa5 with Nb6 - since that sq is now covered by the Be3 - instead of being forced to play b3 to defend it.  The move also asks Black what he's going to do about his unsupported knight on e5.} Bd6 14. Nxe5 Bxe5 {This piece exchange probably doesn't improve White's position.  Now Black is attacking the b-pawn and making it harder for White to play b3 to defend his knight on a4.} 15. Bb6 {(!?) an interesting practical decision, trying to disrupt the coordination of the Black pieces.} Qd6 {Black moves his queen out of danger and now threatens to play Bc6 (attacking the knight on a4) and consequent threat of ...Bxa4 followed by ...Qxb6.  White's position is already quite difficult. } 16. c4 {(?!) Although this move isn't quite sound, it does force Black to navigate certain dangers as he picks up more material.} Bxb2 {(?) Black goes wrong almost immediately.  Perhaps he was confused by having three different pawn captures available: ...dxc4; ...bxc3 e.p.; and the move played.  Taking the c-pawn en passant would have been the best choice - then there wouldn't have been a DSB en pris on b2 in many variations.  However, Black is eying the Ra1...} 17. c5 {(!) Making the most of Black's mistake to muddy the waters.  This move has several points: (1) it creates a passed pawn which provides compensation for the lost material; (2) it defends the bishop on b6 so now White is threatening to take the Black bishop on b2 with his knight; and (3) it attacks Black' s queen, forcing it to move away from the defence of his own king, which soon finds itself under attack.} Qe5 {There wasn't much else -- Black needs to move his Queen and at the same time defend his bishop.} 18. Nxb2 Qxb2 {White's decision to exchange the Bb2 has brought the Black queen into the heart of the White position.  Together with the knight on e4 this presents a real danger and White must be careful.} 19. Qa4+ {(?) although this is a natural looking move, it's actually a mistake.  Safer was Qc1, keeping an eye on d2 and not giving up any more material.} Kf8 {(?) Black returns the mistake.  Understandably, Black wants to get his king as far away from White's pieces as possible.  However, ...Ke7 would have been much better (and shown up White's previous error), since it would have covered the crucial d7 square and prevented White's queen infiltrating there.  Had Black found ...Ke7 he would have been in very good shape since he is threatening to capture the Ra1 and also the nasty ...Qd2  (winning the Be2).  If White had continued with 0-0 then Black can play ...Nc3 (or even just ...Qxe2), which forks the Qa4 and Be2, winning further material.} 20. O-O {(!) Better late than never.  The difference is that now ...Nc3 does not automatically win material because White will play Qd7 and Black is losing either his Bb7 or Ra8 in return.} g6 {(?) A case of chess blindness.  Explained thus: the players had agreed to finish the game in one session from around this point on.  The errors creep up, now; though so does the tension.  The simple 20...  Qxe2 was perfectly playable and, although Black is losing his LSB after 21. Qd7, his king is in only superficial danger and he would still be a couple of pawns up.  Less good, but still okay was 20 ...Nc3.  I had failed to see that the Be2 was immediately capturable and suddenly got anxious about my king. Unfortunately ...g6 doesn't much improve the king's safety but certainly does lose the opportunity of winning material!} 21. Bf3 {Moving the bishop out of danger.} Nc3 {(?!) I also considered ...Nd2 but decided it was better to put the knight on a protected square.  Actually, either ...Nd2 or ...Qd4 would probably have been better since the move played just encourages the White queen to go where it's already heading. Generally speaking, if Black can stop his king from getting into too much trouble and prevent White's passed c-pawn from getting too far up the board, he will be okay.  In practice, however, it's difficult to deal with both problems at the same time.  White was already threatening to play c6, advancing the pawn and pushing Black's LSB out of play.} 22. Qd7 {Here, I realised that the intended ...Bc8 just loses the rook instead: White would play 23 Qc6 and, if the Rook moves to b8 (the only square) then 24. Qd6  wins it on the next move.  So Black consigned himself to losing the Bishop and tried to get his king safe.} Kg7 23. Qxb7 {Now White is firmly in the driving seat (a piece up for 2 pawns).} Rhb8 {Hoping somehow to trap the queen -- not a very realistic prospect.} 24. Qc7 Nb5 {Perhaps instead it would have been better simply to capture the a-pawn with the knight -- at least gaining some counter chances with the passed b-pawn.  But Black was nervously trying to chase the White Q out of his position...} 25. Qg3 Rbc8 {Stopping the pawn's advance for the time being.} 26. Rfe1 {With the idea of 27. Qe5 , swapping off Queens to an easily won endgame.  Black wants to keep the Queens on the board (even though his king is the less safe), to keep the position complex.} Nc3 {(?!)  Here, in view of what follows, ...Nd4 would have been better, protecting the e6 sq. and perhaps considering trading White's LSB.} 27. Qe5+ Kg8 28. c6 {(!) An excellent move.  White sees that Black can't take the pawn on c6 with 28...Rxc6 after all, since White would simply play 29. Bd4 and Black is getting checkmated on g7.  Because White is going to play 29. Bd4 anyway, Black must find a way to defend.  It was only now that I began to appreciate how dangerous White's attack was.} Rcf8 {The safest thing would have been to give up the knight to get the queens off the board with 28...Ne2 .  However, practically speaking this would have lost in the long run also, so Black decided to continue to live on the knife edge.} 29. Bd4 f6 {Forced.  Black must defend against the threat of mate.} 30. Qxe6+ {The pawn shield begins to disappear...} Kg7 31. Bxf6+ {(?) White is a little too keen to get at Black's king.  His attack is easily winning so there's no need to rush things with this move.  After Black recaptures, he will face sustained pressure it is true, but the fact that material is now level again means that, for example, it becomes okay for Black to seek the exchange of Queens.  Perhaps White got the move order confused, since 31.Qe7  first would have been good.  Then, if 31...Rf7 32. Bxf6  would have been possible since the Rf7 is pinned to the king on the 7th rank.} Rxf6 32. Qd7+ Rf7 33. Qe6 Rf6 {Here Black offered a draw - more in hope than anything else - after this mini repetition of position.  White rightly turned down the draw since his position is clearly strategically better, but Black is still in the game.} 34. Qh3 Rf7 {There's nothing better than this - to stop the c-pawn's advance.  White now needs to find an infiltration point and this has its challenges since the obvious c-file (behind his passer) is blocked by Black's N.} 35. Ref1 {(?!) But it can't be right to take the R off the open file.   White wants to be able move his Bf3 without worrying about ...Qxf2  supported by the Rf7, but better was Qg3, planning to advance the h-pawn and break open Black's king.  Then, in response to the cheeky 35...Re8 (hoping for Rxe8?? ...Qxa1  mating White's king), White can play 36. c7 or 36. h4 since it's not in Black's interests to exchange Rooks on the e-file..  However, it is actually surprisingly hard for White to make real progress in this position (though during the game I believed I was busted).} a5 {(?!) aiming for ...a4 and ...b3, but 35...Re8 would have been much more active.  In that case it's almost equal.} 36. Qg3 Qd2 {Black was looking at ideas of ...Rxf3 and then ...Ne2 , forking Qg3 and Kg1.  At present this doesn't work: White just plays gxf3.  Black tries to centralise his Q and clear the b-pawn's path while he waits for concrete action by White.} 37. Qe5+ Kg8 {(?) Played automatically, but the k is safer on h6.  White now finds an excellent Rook sacrifice to force the breakthrough...} 38. Rad1 {(!!)  The idea is to divert the Nc3, then clear the Black q's protection of the d-file, allowing Bxd5 with a vicious pin on the Rf7 (this idea would not have worked if the Black king were on h6).} Nxd1 {Black is required to accept the sacrifice.} 39. Rxd1 {Gaining the d-file but unprotecting the f2 sq.  I thought White had missed this but actually it's all been calculated.} Qxa2 {Hoping the passed a- and b- pawns provide some counter-chances.} 40. Bxd5 {(!) Played anyway.  White sees that Black gets the f2 pawn, but no more.} Qxf2+ 41. Kh1 {Amazingly, despite being the exchange and a pawn to the good, Black is losing in all variations.  Now best was ...Qf5, offering a trade of queens, but Black's pinned Rf7 gives White the best of any tactics.} Raa7 {Trying to stop the c-pawn, ineffectively.  Now, White has the crushing 42. c7! and Black would be only a move or so away from resignation.  Black must take the pawn since if ...Ra8 - to stop the c-pawn queening, not Bxa8?? (since that unpins the Rf7 and allows ...Qf1 mating White) but simply 43. Bxf7  followed by 44. Rd8 , winning).  However ...Raxc7 would nevertheless have been answered by 43. Qxc7 - that pinned rook on f7 can only look on - and White will emerge a queen up - or get mate - after taking on f7 with the Bd5.} 42. Bxf7+ {(?) Going wrong at the crucial moment.  After this the position should be drawn since Black is a pawn up but the advanced White c-pawn keeps the balance.} Rxf7 43. Rd8+ Rf8 {Now, in this simplified position, things start to unravel for White.  He needed to be thinking about how to hold the draw, but that calls for an extensive psychological adjustment since only a few moves ago he was completely won.} 44. Qe6+ {A slight innacuracy.  White needed to trade rooks and go in for a variation where he gives up his c-pawn for Black's a- and b-pawns.} Kg7 {Black has the benfit of certain tactics involving White's back rank and this helps him wriggle out of the checks.} 45. Qe7+ {(?) A (natural) mistake, which Black fails to exploit.} Rf7 46. Qe5+ {Now, amazingly, 46...Qf6! would have won for Black.  In that case he would threaten the White queen and White rook on d8 AND mate on f1, so White would have been forced to exchange queens.  But, after 47. Qxf6 ....Rxf6, Black's continued mating threat on the back rank means that after White defends (e.g. with 48. g4) Black is free to capture the pawn on c6, when his passed Q-side pawns will decide the game in his favour. } Kh6 {(?) missing the win.  I was, in truth, so relieved to be in drawing territory once again, that it never occured to me I might have something better.} 47. h3 Qf1+ {47...Rf5 would have been better, guarding the a-pawn.  Black was too keen to give a check himself, for a change.} 48. Kh2 Qc1 {Keeping the c-pawn in check. This position should be drawn as White can't get his pawn forward and both sides have certain perpetual check ideas with queens still on.} 49. Rd4 {(!) A split second before I got ready to capture the c6 pawn (which I thought White had forgotten to protect), I noticed that 50. Rh4   would be mate!} Qg5 {Stopping the mate threat and offering the Q trade.} 50. Qxg5+ Kxg5 51. Rd5+ {Aiming to win the a-pawn.} Kf6 52. Rxa5 Ke6 53. Ra6 Kd5 {Both sides are guilty of being overambitious in this ending.  53...Rc7 was simple and good.  Black is trying to walk his b-pawn down the board with his king.} 54. Rb6 Kc5 55. Rb7 Rf8 56. c7 {Now, Black must be very careful.  Trying to dislodge the White rook with ...Kc6 loses to Rb8! and after 57. Kxc7 (otherwise the pawn queens) Rxf8 is winning for White as Black's b-pawn isn't quick enough.} Rc8 57. Kg3 Kd5 {(!)  Finding the right plan at last.  57...Kc4, with the idea of shephearding the b-pawn home can lead to disaster: White gets to d7 with his king and forces Black to give up rook for the c-pawn then he gives up his own rook on b2 or b1 for Balck's b-pawn and in the meantime sends his king over to the k-side to munch the Black pawns.  Black's move keeps the W king out of the queenside.} 58. Kf4 h6 {Now this move, to keep the White king out of g5.  Black's idea is that he will push his b-pawn, force White to take it with his rook - thereby unprotecting the c-pawn - and allowing ...Rxc7.} 59. Rxb4 {There's nothing better.  White could try to play g4 and g5 but Black will play ...h5 and White can't force the win of the K-side pawns.} Rxc7 60. Rb5+ Ke6 61. Re5+ {Now White is guilty of trying too hard.  Psychologically it's hard to accept a draw when you know you missed a win earlier, but it was time to sue for peace.  This position is a dead theoretical draw.  Which is to say that neither side can force a win; the only winning chances are presented by unforced errors.  The Rook being on e5 presents certain tactical opportunities...  Instead 61 Rb6  ...Kf7 and there's no way for White to make progress.} Kf7 62. g4 Kf6 {By this move Black is demonstrating there's no way for White to continue safely.  Black offered a draw again here, but White still can't let go of his delusions of winning...} 63. h4 {(??) A horrid blunder and, as they say, the last mistake.  White needed to realise his K and R are precariously placed: a Black check on the 4th rank is going to cause problems since White's rook is attacked by Black's king.} g5+ {(!) Taking his chance!  The immediate 63...Rc4  achieves nothing because after 64 Re4 the rook swap on e4 doesn't dislodge White's king far enough.} 64. hxg5+ hxg5+ {Perhaps in this position White had intended 65. Rxg5 and then saw that after 65...Rc4  he loses his rook on g5 for nothing.} 65. Ke4 {Now, however, the check on c4 is deadly.} Rc4+ 66. Kd5 {Wanting to maintain protection of his Re5.  Other moves also lose: (66.Kd3 ...Kxe5 67. Kxc4 ...Kf4 etc.)} Rc5+ {(!) Dislodging the W King away from the protection of his last pawn.  White must have missed this diversion tactic.  } 67. Kxc5 Kxe5 {Now White loses his g-pawn and can't get back in front of Black's g-pawn to stop it queening.  Around here White finally decided that a draw would be a fair result and offered one.  However, Black is no longer willing to share the point.} 68. Kc4 Kf4 69. Kd3 Kxg4 70. Ke3 Kg3 71. Ke2 Kg2 {Black keeps the White king out.  There's no way to stop the pawn queening.} 72. Ke1 g4 73. Ke2 g3 74. Ke1 Kh2 {Here, White resigned.  Black plans just ... g2 and ....g1=Q on his next two moves, regardless of White's replies.  A very hard fought game. The final result didn't really reflect the course of the struggle (first Black, then White, should have won; and afterwards a draw would have been a fair outcome), but it does offer a valuable lesson that you must always consider your position objectively - playing on in a drawn position can occasionally backfire horribly.  Thanks to nathanman22 for this exciting encounter!  Any comments welcome.}
