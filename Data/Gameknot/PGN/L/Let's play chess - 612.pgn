1. c4 {this was an interesting game where i had to conserve my nerves against a powerful and intimidating attack. hopefully there was nothing probing in it, and i had the opportunity to claim back the center to take the initiative, until i had the possibility to gain a pawn, There is wher my opponent decided to "give" me a bishop... the end is less funny.} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. e4 Bb4 4. d3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 {i like this opening.} h6 6. Nf3 d6 7. Ba3 {this is a try, first time i do it. Won't do it again, there is nothing there for white light bishop} c5 8. Qc2 O-O 9. Be2 Nc6 10. O-O {already ending the development.} Nh7 11. Nd2 f5 {f5 from black: always a threat!} 12. f3 Qg5 13. Bc1 {the bishop has to go back before the a1 rook could enter into the defence game. but it will be all right. I calculated it.} f4 {closing the attack: it gives me some tempos...} 14. Nb3 Bh3 {of course: this was a possibility, but, once again, nothing decisive.} 15. Rf2 {no black dark bishop, no knight can attack this strong rook.} Be6 16. Bf1 {overcastling} Rf6 {second attack} 17. Bd2 {preparing my own counter-attack} Rg6 {yes, yes, yes... still nothing...} 18. Be1 Rf8 {here you are... but many people for such a small place, isn't it?} 19. a4 {my turn} a5 {this is exactly what i wanted: close a place for your knight} 20. Qd1 {is she pointing f3?} Bh3 21. d4 {NO, she is pointing d4!} exd4 22. cxd4 cxd4 23. Nxd4 Nxd4 24. Qxd4 {and here i am!} Qe5 25. Rd1 Qxd4 26. Rxd4 {"this is the place i always wanted to beeeee"} Bd7 {threatening a4?} 27. c5 {not quite. if you take it, i take you. If dxc5, i take you... so back up!} Bxa4 {wazup??? i told you to back up!} 28. Rxa4 dxc5 29. Rxa5 {i have two versions: or he was distracted, or he thought: my best chance is to go on with these two isolated pawns... but really they are too isolated... and my bishops are strong. And your knight is so far!} b6 {yes, yes yes...} 30. Rb5 Ng5 {threatening Nh3+ and a fork} 31. Kh1 {so the king gets a room} Rc6 32. Bc4+ {blockade to give time to the other pieces. the check was a bonus} Kh8 33. Rfb2 Rd8 {i expected Rb8, so i could make Bf2, but he is looking for the easy mate.} 34. Bd5 {cut the passage.} Rcd6 35. Rb5xb6 Rxb6 36. Rxb6 {simplificate.} Rc8 37. Bc4 {blockade again} Rd8 {insisting} 38. Kg1 {mate threats is over} Rc8 39. Bd2 Rf8 40. Rc6 {hard to protect two pawns with one rook... the end is an esay one.} Rf6 41. Rxf6 gxf6 42. Bxf4 Kg7 43. Bd6 h5 44. Bxc5 h4 45. Bd5 Nf7 46. Bxf7 Kxf7 47. Bf2 h3 48. gxh3 Kg6 49. Bh4 Kf7 50.
