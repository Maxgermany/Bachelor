1. e4 {Ok the first rule of chess is that white always moves first. This is a very important rule that goes back years and years to a time when people were a bunch of racistist. } e5 {wait a second... what colour am i?} 2. Nf3 {oh yeah i'm black. Good. That was him moving his horse. Ok Ok. Rule number two. Always research your opponent for strengths and weaknesses. } d6 {Today i am up against a solid 1500 player called volhouder. I checked out his profile. He's Dutch and looks just like Sven goran Erikson. He might be interested in football? I could post messages on this topic to distract him at a crucial stage. I'll add this to my chess notes at the side of the board.} 3. h3 {One of the first things i noticed about Volhouder is that he is pretty old. About 70. So hes got lots of good chess experience. } b6 {Having said that old people do tend to make silly mistakes. Like my dad for instance. He kept forgetting to take his keys when he left his house and ended up having to smash the front door down like 3 times in a week or something} 4. Bc4 {There's no use trying unorthodox fancy moves against someone with as much experience as volhouder. The guys probably seen just about every chess move there is. I'm going to play it nice and safe for the mean time.} h6 {Moving my pawn up stops him moving his horse into g5. He'd then be in a threatening position for a check with his bishop} 5. Nc3 {Ok now he's moved his other horse out. He is starting to 'develop' by getting his major pieces off the back line. Apparently it is good to 'develop' early on. Someone told me this. Although i'm yet to see any real evidence that this is true.} Bb7 {Ok i think this was my first mistake... i've broken my back line and started to develop as well. Before i had all my major pieces in a nice straight line. Seriously though... moving my bishop to b7 is a good move against the less experienced chess players like children or drunk people. They often forget about pieces in the corners so try to cram as many pieces in there for a surprise attack. This is a good move against anyone with a rating of 1100 or lower.} 6. d3 {Unfortunately for me though, my opponent is of a much higher standard. Asking the obvious question... why did i bother making this move? Ok, anyway, he has now moved his pawn up to d3. This provides further support to his pawn on e4 that my bishop was attacking. It also allows his black bishop to come out and develop/attack if he wants} a6 {I'm now building a safe area to castle into. If i choose to castle that side my king will be well protected...  Apparently it's important to castle in the first 12 moves. I'd like to disagree with this statement but i've lost track of the number of games i've messed up through NOT castling early enough} 7. a3 {still no pieces taken and there are no obvious signs that things will change in the next few moves} Ne7 {Hopefully volhouder will forget his house keys like my dad. That way he might time out. } 8. Be3 {I love it when your opponents times out. You win the game without even having to think or nothing. Remember kids… it’s the winning that really matters, not the taking part. No one likes a loser } g6 {Ok so he now has both horses and bishops out and in play. In good attacking positions. One of my horses is blocking in my bishop. Can't really go anywhere either. I'll have to move a pawn to free the bishop up. g6} 9. d4 {i think he wants to get rid of my central pawns. I'm currently in no position to castle and do not want to lose my middle pawns as it will leave my king vulnerable. time to bring in some extra support} f6 {I know it's hard to believe but i actually don't really know that much about chess. However, i'm pretty sure that it's NOT a good idea to have moved three pawns all up one space like i have on the right hand side of the board. I would also imagine that most good chess players would tell you that white is in a much stronger position at this stage } 10. Be6 {never saw that coming... don't know what he is playing at but i sure as hell don't like it} Bg7 {oh yeah great move... how has that bloody helped? Don't know what i was thinking there?} 11. d5 {Ok now i'm feeling really uncomfortable. Not a good position to be in at all. I don't have any pawns to force his bishop to retreat as i moved them all up like a crazy person. He has now supported it with a pawn and gained total control of the middle of the board.} Nd7 {That last comment about gaining total control of the middle of the board might well be rubbish. I once heard someone say that in reference to a game of chess and i think it kind of fits this game??? Yeah so i just threw it in there to try and sound clever. Anyway, i've moved my horse to d7. I now remember why i moved my black bishop to g7. It means my knight can move back to f8 and get rid of that bishop} 12. Bxd7+ {Looks like he decided to swap sooner than i had expected. It was a good move actually. Otherwise I would have moved my knight back to f8 attacking his bishop. His white bishop would have been unable to retreat safely due to my solid line of pawns on the right. If i had then swapped my knight for his bishop on e6 he would have found it very difficult to get any support up to his loan pawn sitting on e6. Not sure if any of that makes sense? I think i've just very badly over explained a move which never happened....} Qxd7 {obvious swap. I've managed to get rid of the bishop at the expense of one of my knights. I also now have the option to castle on either side. Both sides are well protected with my bishops and pawns. I can wait to see which side is safer as the game develops later on. } 13. Ne2 {ok what you won't have realised at this stage is that i had referred to my chess notes a couple of moves back and had begun to engaging volhouder in several football/Sven goran erikson type questions. This tactic obviously worked in distracting him as that last move wasn't the best} f5 {Actually i made that all up. I didn't post any comments to him all game. Wish i had though. Maybe i can use that tactic at a later date though. i can also see why he moved his knight back. He obviously wanted to advance his pawn on c2 to give more support to his pawn on d5. My white bishop is attacking this piece and i want to try and remove his support in the centre. Hence my move to f5} 14. exf5 {What i wanted and expected. I can now take that pawn with one of three pieces. I don't want to leave one pawn by itself out on the right so i better use my queen or my horse} gxf5 {..... i was pretty sure i didn't use the pawn... Oh well, another fine example demonstrating how much of a rubbish chess player i am... I honestly don't know how i ever bloody win a game? Maybe i had a good reason for it. If i did i certainly can't think of it now. Oh yeah but wait... His pawn on d5 is now ready for the taking. He's going to have to get some extra support up to that.} 15. Nc3 {ok... now given my current chess ability i don't like to criticise other players too much. The phrase "Don't throw stones in glass houses" springs to mind. But that last move of his wasn't the best. For a start he just moved that away from there. So he's wasted two moves at a pretty crucial stage in the game. I can also push my pawn up to e4 threatening his other knight and also freeing up my black bishop} e4 {yeap. I can start to see why i used that pawn to take f5 rather than the queen or knight. he's going to have to move his knight. I can then take his other knight with my bishop destroying his pawn formation on the left and leaving his pawn on d5 for the taking} 16. Nh2 {never the best idea to move knights to the edge of the board. He can now only move that piece to one space.} Bxc3+ {check} 17. bxc3 {i will now go  1 up. Not a major advantage but ever piece counts kids. Pawns are crucial at the end game. Because if you get them to the other side you can change them into a bishop of a horse or another pawn} Nxd5 {Yeah i don't think you can change them into another pawn actually. It would be good if you could though. A reverse pawn that goes the opposite way. That way you could try to get it all the way back again to your own back line. Ok, enough of that nonsense, i could have taken the pawn with my white bishop, but by using the knight i am threatening his other pawn on c3 } 18. Bd2 {My biggest trouble with chess is thinking forward to future moves and anticipating peoples next moves. You could say that it's the core to being good at chess. Either way... i'm sh*t at it. That's why i would have made the same move he just did} O-O-O {ok i've now decided to castle. My right hand side is wide open. So obviously i've gone to the left where my king will be well protected} 19. Nf1 {probably for the best. That piece was doing nothing there} Qg7 {Ok now i really should have done this move before castling. As it happens it hasn't really made any difference but i gave him the chance to stop it had he seen it. My queen is now attacking his pawn on g2 which he will not want to let me take, but it is also attacking his pawn along with my knight on c3. I'm going to go  2 up either way} 20. Rg1 Nxc3 {obviously he won't take my knight as i would then come down and check him with my queen. He'd then have to move his king. Although having said that he can't really castle anymore anyway} 21. Qc1 {at this stage i figured i better move my knight. If he gets his queen into b2 i'll be in trouble} Na4 {yeah i know i said you shouldn't put your knight on the edge of the board but i must have had a good reason for it at the time... surely?} 22. Ng3 {ok ok, now watch carefully. I'm about to pull of a special trick which is very uncommon amongst the 1500  rated players. As far as i'm aware i'm one of the very few chess players to have truly mastered this skill.} f4 {Yeap... it's the art of giving your pieces away for no good reason. } 23. Bxf4 {I'm not really sure at what stage i mastered this skill? I think i might have just been born with it. Here we go again....} Rhf8 24. Bxh6 {Nice job Deathwolf. You've just lost that important  2 lead you worked so hard to build up and you've also stuck your castle and queen in front of each other... Uh oh} Qc3+ {now luckily this move was available otherwise i probably would have just resigned in disappointment/frustration.} 25. Bd2 {I've managed to save my castle and i'm still in better shape than him on the board. It's all even but my king is well protected and my castles are linked up on the back line.  His king is stuck in the middle  and pretty exposed} Qc5 {ok it's pretty obvious what i'm going for here. But there is still no harm in trying. He might make a mistake and mess up} 26. Be3 {nope} Qb5 {ok now i can't actually remember what i was trying to do here but i'm sure it was something pretty tasty} 27. Ne2 {oh yeah i wanted to move my knight into c3 ready for the checkmate with my queen. Looks like he read my thoughts and put a stop to that move though} a5 {looking to move my bishop in behind the queen... for the checkmate} 28. Nd4 {not really changing anything here} Qc4 {similar position} 29. Ne2 {back he goes} Ba6 {ready for the checkmate} 30. Qd2 Qxe2+ {another 'crack pipe' moment from me... no real need to swap pieces here. Probably should have kept my queen as i was in a better position. Must have got bored or something. Bad move by me} 31. Qxe2 {...} Bxe2 {...} 32. Kxe2 {His king is now off the back line, his castles are linked and much stronger} d5 {ok now i'm bored of typing. I've got a pretty short attention span... not the best quality for playing chess. Anyway, i probably won't post another comment for a few moves. You just have a look at the board and guess what i would have said.} 33. Bd2 Rf7 34. Rab1 Rdf8 35. Rgf1 d4 36. f3 e3 37. Be1 Rf7f6 38. g4 Rc6 39. Kd3 Rd8 40. Rh1 Nc5+ 41. Ke2 Ne6 42. Kd1 Ng5 43. Bh4 Rd5 44. Bxg5 Rxg5 {not a lot has happened has it.... lots of moving my castles with no real change to the board} 45. Rh2 Rd6 46. Ke2 Rc5 47. Kd1 Rc3 48. Rb3 Rxb3 {ok, i realise i probably should have moved my other castle to c6 rather than exchanging on b3. This would have made it easier to take his pawns on the left. Certainly the one on a3} 49. cxb3 d3 {I think i got carried away with the thought of promoting one of my pawns. I guess you could say i was overconfident at this stage} 50. Rh1 b5 51. f4 Rd4 52. f5 Rf4 {at this stage i thought i was easily going to win} 53. Ke1 {i had it all planned out in my head} Rf2 54. h4 d2+ 55. Kd1 a4 56. b4 c5 57. h5 {at this stage i realised i'd probably f*cked it up. } c4 {but on closer inspection i realised it wasn't as bad as i first thought. Believe it or not i'm quite good at end games. It's all the chess before that which i'm a bit of a liability at.} 58. h6 c3 59. h7 {the clever move is coming in a minute} e2+ {wait for it...} 60. Kc2 {wait for it......} Rh2 {there.... Ok so it's not that clever, but it still does the trick. If i had pushed my pawn on e2 forward, he would have queen'd up on h8 putting me in check and gaining the advantage. By moving my castle to h2 i'm forcing his castle off the back line. Allowing me to get a queen and put him in check at the same time.} 61. Rxh2 {now i guess he could have pushed his pawn up putting me in check first and then swapped castles... but that would have just delayed the out come. So to would have moving his castle to another square on the back line. } d1=Q+ {now if i'd have had any style i would have promoted that pawn to a bishop. But i don't. And i like to make sure i win. After all, winning is the most important part of chess (see 'golden rule'). It also would have been a little insulting and cheeky to my very talented opponent who probably deserved to win this game.} 62. Kxc3 e1=Q+ {in summary...} 63. Kb2 {i guess i got lucky on a few occasions. It could have very easily been volhouder winning this game. I recommend challenging him to a game sometime. Just make sure you don't use my tactics about mentioning Sven Goran Erikson. I'm saving that for the much anticipated rematch ;)} Qdb1# {Don't let my rating fool you. The only reason it's so high is because i keep challenging this 7 year old kid with a rating of about 250. I've beaten him like 10 thousand times now. Thank you and i hope you've enjoyed my rubbish annotation.}
