1. e4 c5 2. f4 {I was hoping for a Kings gambit, my fav move nowadays. Oh well, reflexively I  still play f4- ppl have told me this is the Grand prix opening.} e6 3. Nf3 d6 4. Bc4 Nc6 5. O-O {Want to castle quickly and attack his kingside} Be7 6. Nc3 a6 7. a4 {to prevent b5} Na5 {I dont think his knight move to a5 accomplishes anything. Knight is pushed to one side of the board.} 8. Ba2 {And I simply withdraw here, from where this serpent can uncoil and strike its long arm later} b6 9. d3 {activate my dsb} Bb7 10. Be3 {okay, all pieces developed. Now it is 'har har mahadev'- Hindu war cry, lol} Nf6 11. Ng5 {Decide to attack his kingside, no definite plan as such. Feeling, exploring, needling a superior ranked player} h6 {withdraw my knight, no I have other ideas. Can you guess?} 12. e5 {harass his knight, disrupt his center. If h6 x N, then the pawns on his kingside shall be disrupted} Nd7 {quiz- what would you do now ?? Think.... then see what I did next !!} 13. Nxe6 {Wham- knight sacrifice- if he takes it ....the fun begins. Fasten yr seatbelts} fxe6 14. Qh5+ {wham-  the wicked witch blasts into place} Kf8 15. Bxe6 {He is in trouble. Almost certainly will lose his knight on d7, and if I can only open up the f file.} g6 {he surprised me with this move,  I had been expecting Q to e8} 16. Qxg6 {never mind.  gobble gobble for now} Qe8 17. Qf5+ Kg7 18. Bxd7 Qd8 19. Ne4 {Don't like his lsb pointing at my g2 pawn. Dont want complications should his rook move to g8 in the future. Also brings my knight over into the attack} Bxe4 {oh well, he goes for the exchange} 20. dxe4 Rf8 {now his turn to harass, rightly so wants to drive my queen away. Note- I am 3 pawns up} 21. Qg4+ Kh8 {What do I do now?? I think of a way to bring my bishop to c3 with an uncluttered a1- h8 diagonal. watch..} 22. exd6 Bxd6 23. Bd2 {bishop withdraws for now } Be7 24. Rad1 {suddenly, I decide to postpone the move of my dsb for now. bringing this rook here, I kind of eye his queen !!} Nc4 {his knight springs into life and surprises me. In one move it has centralised and if it moves to e3- it is a royal fork attacking both rooks and queen. Be very careful...} 25. Bc3+ Bf6 26. Qg6 {Dont mind the bishop exchange for he has lost his h pawn. The defence of his king is crumbling} Bd4+ 27. Bxd4+ cxd4 {he has blocked off the d file and my bishop could be lost} 28. Qxh6+ Kg8 29. Be6+ {bishop escapes} Rf7 30. Qg6+ Kh8 31. Qxf7 {Dont mind if his knight forks me on e3, for my f rook will go to f3- h3, mate. Hope you enjoyed, this is chess for fun, for adrenalin junkies. When his pawn came out to harass me on move 11- h6- he had no idea that an attack could materialise from nowhere. COULD HE HAVE SAVED THE GAME AFTER MY KNIGHT SAC- pl let me know. Pl comment freely and pl rate if you think this game is good.}
