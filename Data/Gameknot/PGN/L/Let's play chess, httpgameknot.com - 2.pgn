1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 {A secondary move, probably to avoid the main theory. } 4. O-O Nf6 5. d4 {The white open immediately the centre due that the black king has still to castle and the black bishop is still on f8. } exd4 6. e5 {A tipycal move in this kind of position. } Ng4 {A mistake not seen by both players. After h3 the black lose a piece. } 7. Re1 Bb4 8. Bd2 a5 9. Bxb4 {Alternative variation: 9. h3 [ and the white is a piece up]  } axb4 10. Nxd4 {A mistake. After Qh4 there is a double attack on h2 and f2, and the white cannot defend both. } O-O {Alternative variation: 10... Qh4 11. h3 Qxf2+ 12. Kh1 Ne3 13. Rxe3 Qxe3  } 11. Qxg4 d6 {The White is a piece up, but it is possible to get back the piece by d5!, due that there is a double attack to the queen and the bishop. Alternative variation: 11... d5 12. Qf4 Nxd4 13. Qxd4 dxc4  } 12. Qd1 Nxe5 13. Bf1 {A safe place for the bishop leaving the e file free for the rook. } Qf6 14. c3 c5 15. Nf3 Bg4 16. Be2 Rad8 17. Nxe5 {Any exchange helps White, due that is a piece up, and there is not any risk of counterplay. } dxe5 18. Qc2 Bf5 19. Qb3 Qc6 20. cxb4 Rfe8 21. b5 Qg6 22. a4 {With the idea to get counterplay pushing the pawns, and to find a better place for the bishop (c4) and the knight (c3). } b6 23. Bc4 Re7 24. Nc3 {The planned set-up is reached, now the White has to find a way to exploit the piece up. } Bc2 25. Qa2 Red7 26. a5 Ra7 27. a6 {Now the black rooks need  to take care of the possible advance of the a6 pawn. } Qf5 28. Rad1 {Probably not the best move, but the bishop on c2 is a strong piece limiting white's activity.  } Bxd1 29. Rxd1 Rxd1+ {Probably it was better to not exchange the rook. Black lose the rook pair, the control of the d file and now the knight and bishop are stronger than the rook that has to be care of the a6 pawn. } 30. Nxd1 Qc2 31. Ne3 Qc1+ 32. Nf1 Qf4 33. b3 Kf8 34. g3 Qd4 35. Qd2 Qxd2 36. Nxd2 {White is totally winning. The black rook cannot move, and the a6 pawn is strong. There is not any possible defence. } Re7 37. Ne4 Rd7 38. Nc3 Ke7 39. Nd5+ Kf8 40. Nxb6 Rc7 41. Nd5 Rd7 42. b6 Ke8 43. a7 Rd8 44. b7 {}
