1. e4 {I was black in this league game and I am pleased with this game.  Black built a great defence on the queenside and a5 was a move which was integral to black's defence.} e5 {After e4 black went with king's pawn to e5 and is stating his aims immediately!} 2. c3 {White pushed his pawn to c3.  I believe this is a move in the ponziani opening but white would go with Nf3 and then c3.  An expected move might have been d4 to attack e5 and take the centre for white.} f5 {Black decides to go with pawn to f5 attacking the centre pawn himself and not worrying if taken as will block the pawn's route on the f file with Nf6.} 3. exf5 {White captures the f5 pawn and the fight is already on for ownership of the centre.} Nf6 {Black develops his knight with Nf6 and is attacking squares in the centre of the board.} 4. d4 {White pushes his pawn to d4 attacking black's centre pawn on e5 and making a pawn chain.} e4 {Black pushes his e5 pawn to e4 protected by the knight on f3.} 5. Be3 {White decides to prevent the pawn continuing down the e file with Be6.} d5 {Black gives his e4 pawn further protection with pawn to d5.} 6. Bb5+ {Now white checks black's king with Bb5.} c6 {Blacks pushes a pawn out to c6 to block the attack and has a pawn chain to e4 but has not developed many pieces.} 7. Be2 {White retreats his LB to e7.  At present it looks quite equal on the control of the centre as white has 3 pawns and a piece and black also has 3 pawns and a piece in the centre.  } a5 {Black pushes a pawn to e5 to give white a problem with accessing the queenside as this pawn is protected by 2 pieces, the queen and the rook.} 8. a3 {White obviously doesn't want black to have too much control over the a file and pushes his pawn to a3.} Bxf5 {Black decides to capture the pawn at f5 which did not seem to be important to white as he had not protected it.} 9. Bh5+ {Now white checks black's king again on h5.} g6 {Again black pushes a pawn to g6 to block the check which opens up black's pawns and leaves the king more susceptible to an attack.} 10. Be2 {White again retreats his LB after it has done its job and it is safe to attack again.} Qd7 {Black now pushes his queen to d7.  This joins the LB on the diagonal but perhaps another piece could have been developed before the queen.  This does now leave the a5 pawn to be protected only by the rook.} 11. Nd2 {White develops his knight to d2 attacking the pawn at e4 which until then was not attacked but as a very important pawn was being well protected by black (3 times!)  } Ng4 {Black moves Ng4 and attacks the DB at e3 which has nowhere to retreat.} 12. Qa4 {So white leaves the DB on prise and moves his queen to a4.  I don't think the queen will be there long.} b5 {Black pushes his pawn to b5 attacking the queen.  The queen has to retreat as neither of the pawns on a5 or b5 can be captured without risking the queen being captured.} 13. Qd1 {White's plan so far is move forward and then move back again ie, going nowhere.  So white retreats the queen and this will end unhappily for white.} Nxe3 {Black captures the DB at e6 with the knight and is now threatening the queen at d1.} 14. fxe3 {White captures the knight with the pawn at f2 and this has opened up the f file and left a gaping hole in the king's defences.} Qe7 {Black moves the queen over now to e7 to provide support to the pawn at e4.  Also the queen now has a clear view to h4 and a check on the white king.} 15. b4 {White pushes a pawn to b4 to attack black's pawn at a5 .} a4 {Black pushes his a5 pawn to a4 putting a block on the b and a files.  Black now has a good defensive pawn chain which goes from e4 to c6 and c6 to a4.  It seems like black's queenside is safe as houses!} 16. Bg4 {White decides to exchange his remaining bishop with black's bishop at f5.} Qh4+ {But black decides to check the king with Qh4.} 17. g3 {White pushes his pawn to g3 as there was nothing else to defend with unless he moved the king.} Qxg4 {So black captured the LB on g4 opposite the white queen still on d1.  This could mean an exchange of queens and black was ready for this.} 18. Qxg4 Bxg4 {White captured the queen as expected and black recaptured with the LB.} 19. h3 {White pushed the h pawn to h3 and is attacking the LB.} Be6 {Black moves his LB away to avoid capture by the pawn to e6.} 20. Ne2 {White develops his g knight to e2 so that white can castle long or short.  I don't know which way is better since pawns have been moved to the 3rd rank and therefore offer little protection to the king.} Nd7 {Black now develops his knight to d7.  So castles seem to be the order of the day.} 21. O-O {White castles short and not too safe with both his h and g pawns already moved to h3 and g3.} Bxh3 {Immediately black captures the h2 pawn with his LB.} 22. Rf4 {White goes with Rf4 and is taking control of the f file.} O-O-O {Black now castles long and black also does not have any protective pawns but he does have a very good queenside defence.} 23. Rh4 {White moves his rook to h4 and is attacking the LB at h3.} Bf5 {Black moves his LB to f5 protecting his pawns at g6 and e4.} 24. g4 {White moves his g pawn to g4 and is attacking the LB.} Be6 {Black retreats his LB further to e6.} 25. Nf4 {White brings his knight to f4 and is attacking the LB again.} Bf7 {So the LB now finds a safe place to hide away on f7 where it is protecting d5 and g6.} 26. g5 {White moves his g pawn up the g file to g5.} h5 {Black decides to cement white's g5 pawn with pawn to h5.  This also keeps the rook on h4 unable to make an attack on the h file and the pawn on g5 is blocking the path to the g file.} 27. Rf1 {White now brings into play his a1 rook with the move Rf1.} Be7 {Black's final piece is coming into play with Be7 attacking the pawn at g5.} 28. Nh3 {White moves his knight to h3 to protect the g5 pawn.} Be6 {So black moves his LB to e6 and is now attacking the knight on h3.} 29. Nf4 {White brings his knight back to f4 and is attacking the LB.} Bf7 {Black moves his LB back to f7.} 30. Nh3 {Seems both sides are zugzwanging at the moment.  And white moves his knight back to h3.} Rhf8 {So black decides to move things along and he brings his h8 rook to f8 and is protecting his LB at f7.} 31. Nf4 {White comes back again with Nf4.} Bxg5 {Black brings his DB to g5 and captures the pawn and is now attacking both the knight and rook.} 32. Rh3 {White moves his rook to h3 out of harms way.  The knight at f4 is still able to be captured but it is protected by the e3 pawn.} Nf6 {Black brings his knight to f6 and is supporting his pawns at h5 and e4.} 33. Ng2 {White removes his knight from capture and knight goes to g2.  This moves brings the pawn at e3 onto the menu for the DB at g5 and this capture would check the king.} Be6 {Black is bringing his forces to the defence and now moves his LB to e6 and is attacking the rook at h3.} 34. Rh2 {White retreats his rook to h2.} Ng4 {Black attacks the rook again with knight to g4 and the f8 rook is attacking the f1 rook.} 35. Rh3 {White moves his rook to h3 to avoid capture.} Rf2 {Black moves f8 rook to f2 as this square is protected by the knight at g4.  The rook can attack both knights at d2 and g2.} 36. Rxf2 {White captures the rook with his f1 rook.} Bxe3 {Black's knight on g4 was providing protection to the square f2 but black decided not to capture the rook as this would only result in it being recaptured by the king.  Instead black captures the pawn at e3 with the DB and has pinned the rook to the king.} 37. Rxe3 {White's rook at h3 captures the DB at e3.} Nxe3 {Black recaptures the rook with his knight at g4 and black's knight could be recaptured by the knight at g2.} 38. Nxe3 {This is what happens and it all looks as if it is over for black with only 2 pieces against 3 BUT he does have 2 pawns coming down the g and h files which could cause white a problem or two yet.  Watch this space.} g5 {Black pushes a pawn to g5 as he begins to push his 2 queening pawns.  Don't they say that pawns are for pushing.} 39. Rf6 {White moves Rf6 and black's LB is at risk.} Bd7 {Black retreats the LB to d7 still covering the diagonal to h3.} 40. Rh6 {White moves along to h6 and is threatening to take a pawn on h5.  But black may have other ideas.} h4 {Black pushes h5 pawn to h4 and it is not possible for the h6 rook to capture it as the rook would be recaptured by the g5 pawn.} 41. Kf2 {White moves his king out of the line of fire from the 2 pawns to f2.} h3 {Black continues to push his pawns moving pawn h4 to h3 which is now protected by the LB at d2.} 42. Ndf1 {White moves a knight to f1 and if the h pawn continues would be captured on h2.} g4 {Black now pushes his g pawn to g4 and is supporting the h3 pawn.  The g4 pawn is also protected by the LB at d2.} 43. Ng3 {White moves the f knight to g3 and is now covering the h1 square to prevent black from queening the h pawn should black succeed with his aims.} Rf8+ {Now black checks the king with Rf8.} 44. Kg1 {The white king moves out of check to g1.} Rf3 {Black now moves Rf3 and is attacking both knights on e3 and g3.} 45. Nef1 {White moves e knight to f1 and is protecting the other knight on g3.} e3 {Black now pushes another pawn at e4 to e3 protected by the rook at f3.  White may have done better (and avoided letting another pawn out of the box) by moving his g3 knight but he was protecting the h1 square with the g3 knight.} 46. Ne2 {White now moves the g3 knight to e2 and is blocking the progress of the e3 pawn.  The knights are protecting both squares that the g and h pawns would move to so this seems to end black's hopes of queening one of the pawns.} Bf5 {Black moves his LB to f5 and is threatening d3 and an attack on the e2 knight.} 47. Rh8+ {White now checks black's king with Rh5.} Kb7 {Black moves his king out of check to b7.  The rook is unable to check the king on h7 square as this is protected by the LB.} 48. Nh2 {White now moves his f1 knight to h2 and is blocking the progress of the pawn at h3.} Bd3 {Black now moves his LB to d3 attacking the e2 knight.} 49. Nxf3 {White's h2 knight now captures the rook at f3.} gxf3 {Black captures the knight with his pawn at g4 and now the e2 knight is attacked by both the LB and the pawn.} 50. Nf4 {So white moves his knight to f4 and is attacking the LB.} f2+ {Black however pushes his f pawn to check the king.  With this move white resigns.  The game would have ended in checkmate with the likely moves: 51. kh1, f1=Q+; 52. kh2, Qxf4+; 53. kh1, Be4+; 54. kg1, Qf2#}
