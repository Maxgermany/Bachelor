1. e4 {a game with some mistakes from both parts, but I thought very interesting, mostly because of the "central dance" of the Knight} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nxe4 4. O-O d5 5. Bb5+ {not quite sure this is correct. Until this move, i think it is theory and the pawn lost on move 3 is not essential} c6 6. Be2 {I expected Ba4 followed by d3 to regain development} Bd6 7. h3 O-O 8. d3 Nf6 9. Bg5 h6 10. Bh4 Be6 11. Nbd2 Nbd7 12. Bg3 {i liked this move and the idea after.} Nh7 {well, i hoped that ancientart let me time to apply f5. } 13. d4 {but he didn't... I must admit i spent a lot of time on next move, even thinking of abandon my pawn... But I decided to think about Fisher (for once) and saying: every pawn gain is a good pawn...} Qc7 14. dxe5 Nxe5 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 16. Bxe5 Qxe5 {that's where i didn't want to be} 17. Rb1 Qd4 18. Nf3 Qxd1 {yes, I know: too soon to exchange, but I didn't feel confident... Actually I was thinking about offering the draw, because the next 10 moves were totally in my mind.} 19. Rbxd1 Bf5 20. Bd3 Bxd3 21. Rxd3 Rfe8 22. Rfd1 {except this one, i did not expect...} Re7 23. Kf1 Nf6 {ouf! Finally the horse comes back} 24. Re1 Rxe1+ 25. Kxe1 Re8+ 26. Kf1 c5 {Let's go to work... At least I have to force him to offer draw... And then we see...} 27. Rd2 b6 28. Re2 Kf8 29. Rxe8+ {This really surprised me! My pawn is beginning to gain more value!} Kxe8 30. Ne5 Ne4 31. Ke2 f6 32. Ng6 Kf7 {I think this was a mistake} 33. Nf4 d4 {because it forced this too soon. My king is really far.} 34. Nd5 {and now start this very tense Knight dance... Congratulation to ancientart: he made me dance, and dance here...} Ke6 35. Nc7+ Ke5 36. Nb5 a6 {every move was a problem...} 37. Nc7 a5 38. Ne8 g6 39. f3 Nd6 40. Nc7 {gosh, i wished he took it...} Nc4 41. Na8 {expected b3... another surprise...} b5 42. Nc7 Nd6 {i have hesitated: did my b-pawn worth his? I have analyzed this for some time... My wife was not very happy... } 43. b3 Kf4 44. Kf2 {that was my will by Kf4} c4 45. g3+ Ke5 46. Ke2 f5 47. Na6 {another surprise from this devil...} g5 48. Nc5 h5 49. Nd7+ Ke6 50. Nc5+ Kd5 {avoid the draw, this time: i don't want it anymore... Why didn't you propose sooner?} 51. Nd7 h4 {maybe not the cleverest thing i made} 52. gxh4 gxh4 53. Nf8 cxb3 {maybe not the cleverest thing... } 54. cxb3 f4 55. Ng6 {and here begins the plot... } Kc5 56. Nxh4 {??? and here is the final surprise, and probably the loss!!!} Kb4 57. Ng6 Ka3 58. Nxf4 {who cares about these pawns??? why don't you approach to b3?} Kxa2 59. Kd3 Kxb3 60. Kxd4 {and this is decisive and makes it easier to me.} a4 61. Nd5 a3 62. Nc3 b4 63. Ne2 Kb2 64. Nf4 a2 {thank you for the brilliant counter-game until move 56. After that, you made my luck: i don't deserve the win.}
