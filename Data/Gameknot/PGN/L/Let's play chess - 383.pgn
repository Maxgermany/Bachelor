1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. f4 {this  variation is known as Levenfish attack in the sicilian dragon , this variation is un usual  generally in the other variations , In Yugoslavian attack , Classical,kings side casteling variation, black plays Bg7 and he makes hard contra play on the queen side while white attacks on the kings side , howevere, this vriation is very tricky for someone which  doesnt know this variation we shuall see in the follow of the game .} e5 {the idea of the move 6.f4 is block the long diagonal h8-a1 followed by e5, now black must be careful if 6....Bg7?.8.e5!-exd.9.fxd-Nfd7.10.e6 with big advantage for white , if 9...Ng4.10.Bb5+-Kf8.11.Ne6+and the black queen is lost so is the rest of the game . the correct move is 6...Nc6!.7.Nxc6-bxc.8.e5-Nd7.9.Be3-Bd7.10.Qf3......., the move 6....e5 is not so good because the important pawn d6 stays weak and it helps white to close the diagonal h8-a1 for the known DSB.} 7. Nf3 Bg4 8. fxe5 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 dxe5 10. Bg5 {good move ,10.Bg5! pined the knight on f6 with pressure by Qf3 forcing black develop he's Pisces un comfortable.the move 10...Bg7? .11.Nd5-Nbd7.12.Rad1 and its hard to say how long the knight on f6 will stay alive .} Be7 11. Bb5+ Nc6 {that is a blonder , black loosing a bishop after 12.Rd1-Qa5.13.Bxf6-Bxf6.14.Qxf6...., better was 11...Nbd7 but after 12.Rd1-0-0.13.0-0 it seems that black in very difficult situation .} 12. Rd1 Qa5 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Qxf6 O-O 15. Bxc6 bxc6 16. O-O {when you have material advantage of pieces , it  will be better to exchange pieces as soon as possible and going to the endgame with the upper hand .} Qb4 17. Rd7 Qxb2 18. Qxe5 Qxc2 19. Qf6 Qb2 20. Rxf7 Rxf7 21. Qxf7+ Kh8 22. Qf6+ {and black resigns, thank you i hope you enjoyed the game .}
