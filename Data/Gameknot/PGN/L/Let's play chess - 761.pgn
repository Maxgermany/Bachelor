1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 d6 {And we here folks, have a closed Ruy-Lopez: steinitz-like variation!} 7. c3 O-O 8. d4 Bd7 9. Nbd2 exd4 10. cxd4 Nb4 11. Bb3 {I decide to break from lines here. The usual move is Bxd7, but Bb3 is fine as well. } Re8 {Better is 11..Nd3, pestering my rook.} 12. a3 Nc6 13. e5 dxe5 14. Ng5 Nd5 {A terrible miscalculation. My opponent missed the strong strong attack that follows the trades.} 15. Nxf7 Kxf7 {Better was probably Qb8 or something.. my attack is overwhelming.} 16. Qh5+ Kg8 17. Bxd5+ Kh8 18. Be4 {Now black surely realizes the problem!} h6 19. Qg6 Kg8 {Try running if you like, king, I'll catch you!} 20. Qh7+ Kf7 {If Kf8, Bd5! mates} 21. Bg6+ Ke6 22. Qxg7 Rf8 {The move makes the ending quick and elegant, but I am certain that his king would not live much longer!} 23. Rxe5+ Kd6 24. Ne4# {}
