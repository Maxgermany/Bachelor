1. e4 {I nearly always start with e4 as it gets the pieces out quickest} c5 {the sicilian defense. Used by black players who want to achieve a win at all costs.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 d6 7. f3 Nf6 8. Qd2 Bd7 9. Bc4 {We have now reached the main line of the dragon variation. Alternatives are  0-0-0 and g4.} Ne5 10. Bb3 Rc8 11. Bh6 O-O 12. Bxg7 Kxg7 13. O-O-O {completing development.The next stage is to attack black's kingside with h4, h5 opening the h file for the rook} a6 14. h4 b5 15. h5 Rh8 {black disputes control of the h file in the event of 16.hxg6 hxg6} 16. hxg6 hxg6 17. Qg5 Nc4 18. Nf5+ Bxf5 {forced as 18...Kg8 19.Rxh8  Kxh8 20.Rh1  gives white a decisive attack } 19. exf5 Rc5 20. g4 {defending the pinned pawn} a5 {it is now blacks turn to attack on the queenside. } 21. a3 {providing a home for the bishop on a2} b4 22. axb4 axb4 {black has managed to open the a file to attack the white king} 23.

Bxc4 {white now has a pawn for the exchange and pressure against the f pawn} Rh2+ 31. Kb3 Qf8 32. f6+ Kg8 33. cxb4 {if black swaps queens the pawn cannot be stopped!} Rh3+ 34. Kc2 Re3 35. Bd5 Re2+ 36. Kc3 Qc8+ 37. Bc4 {the threat is Qxf7  and if the queen defends it the rook drops} Rc2+ {however black has this resource !} 38. Kxc2 {and here i offered a draw as i canot stop the checks. I really enjoyed playing this game and is a common sort of game in the dragon. First white attacks down the h-file, then it is blacks turn to attack. Finally his  attack runs out of steam but has the resource of perpetual check.Much more exciting than a boring draw in the queen's gambit!}
