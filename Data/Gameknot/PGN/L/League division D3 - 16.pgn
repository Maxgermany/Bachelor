1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {I'm anotating this little minature because I was shocked by the way that black missed my obvious threats. Instead focusing on getting one peice to retreat ignoring the real attack that was being built up.  It opens as a Sicilian Defence.} g6 4. O-O Bg7 5. c3 Nf6 {Still remarkably a by the book opening} 6. d3 {I move d3 to create a stronger centre and to allow development of my black bishop.} O-O 7. Ng5 {Putting pressure on the h7 square that I don't expect to remain there for long. In the end I'm proven wrong on that assumption} a6 {Ok so there is an option to force my advance bishop or knight to move. I was expecting h6 to be used first however.} 8. Bc4 {Moved to safety but at the same time doubling the threat imposed by the knight on g5 as now there is danger on both f7 and h7.} e6 {That is the threat from the bishop and knight double team on f7 dealt with} 9. Bf4 b5 10. Bb3 {Black still wanting the bishop on the Queen's side to move while ignoring the knight right in front of the King's defences. So I withdraw keeping up the threat that is imagined by my opponent.} d5 11. e5 {He advances another pawn on that diagonal whilst leaving the h file still relatively weak. That waekness is increased as I threaten the knight the only defender of the weak h7 square.} Nd7 12. Qf3 {Knight is withdrawn to one of its two safe squares and my Queen is ready to advance into the fray, threatening to get to h3, then the pounce on h7.} c4 13. dxc4 Ndxe5 14. Qh3 {12. ... h6 is yet again the best option for black, but again is overlooked for a vain attack on the white bishop, who yet again is able to flee. However the pawn capture is not an exchange on c4 with a threat by the knight to capture the queen instead. Who will flee to where she was heading anyway h3.} dxc4 {?? Again the obsession with the bishop when h6 is required.} 15. Qxh7# {The failure to move h6 at any point from the 6th move is the reason this miniture ended as it did. Black was obsessed with white bishop down the Queen side, made four pawn moves to threaten it and two to block its line to the king. }
