1. Nf3 {A very short but entertaining game. I am trying this opening for the first time.} e6 2. Nc3 {Lets try to get the knights out instead of the pawn opening.} c6 3. e4 g6 {White has more developed active pieces while black is very under-developed.} 4. d3 Qf6 5. e5 {This move was used more as a ploy to drive away the black queen. It however turned to make things very unpleasant for black.} Qf5 6. d4 Ne7 7. Bg5 {This may be the best move of this game for black. The move attacks the knight and threatens to penetrate the black defence threatening the black bishop and the black rook.} h6 8. Bf6 {Mission accomplished.} Rh7 9. h3 Nd5 10. Bd3 {Now we try to drive away the black queen. She has very few options now and is about to be boxed in.} Qf4 11. g3 {This move seals the black queen. There is no place for her to go !! } Nxc3 12. bxc3 Qxf6 {And there we have her.} 13. exf6 Bd6 14. O-O c5 15. d5 e5 16. c4 b6 {These moves are just strengthening the already strong attack that white has generated.} 17. Qe2 a5 18. Nxe5 Kf8 {Check mate coming up ! } 19. Rfe1 {Preparing the ground-work for the mate trap.} Na6 20. Nxg6+ {Step 1 } Kg8 21. Qe8+ {Step 2 } Bf8 22. Qxf8# {And that was a very nice and exciting game.}
