1. e4 {my prefered opening move. i have read a comment that this a losing move. i don't see how one could ascertain such a conclusion, given there is only one move made, aside from esp.} e5 2. Nf3 {attacking and developing} Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 {h6 has been played against this opening often, in my own experience. to defend the f7 pawn and a rook Q fork as well as hindering the knights forward movement} 4. d4 {i am looking to open the middle and attack. keeping the king from castling and gaining lead in development. the reason for this opening is to start the battling early} d6 5. Be3 {he hasn't taken the pawn instead he defended his e pawn. i continue to develop. Be3 seems ideal spot can cover much ground from here, is not currently blocking me in and adds support to d4} Nf6 {developing and attacking e4.  i wonder if f5 is better} 6. Nc3 {defend} Bg4 {this move is another reason why Be3 was a prefered move early on} 7. h3 Bxf3 8. gxf3 {i take with pawn to open up g file} Na5 9. Bb3 {i move here cause my king is in good shape in the middle and if he takes i could flank my rook} exd4 {he now takes the pawn but i wonder why after he takes the N out of play} 10. Bxd4 {i capture} Nxb3 11. axb3 d5 12. Bxf6 {i take anticipatinghe takes with Q and Nxd5 threatening the Q and im up a pawn } Qxf6 13. Nxd5 Qd6 14. c3 {defending Qd4} O-O-O {curious? this gains me a pawn } 15. Rxa7 Kd7 {his caslting only caused him to be shoved back into the middle where i wanted him} 16. Rxb7 {now im up another pawn and threatening Rc7.  i continued to take peaces instead of developing more support for attack so there would be less to manuever around and it was not at all dangerous to me} Rc8 {defending c7} 17. f4 {openin up diagonal for queen.  also begening pawn atack on his Q} Ke8 18. Qg4 Ra8 19. O-O {had to castle now and it is in no way to his advantage to trade queens. also you see c7 is now open for my N and the position is even better than before.  } h5 {he has forgotten about the c7 pawns vulnerability, toconcerned with my Q} 20. Qf5 g6 21. Nxc7+ {i wanted my Q where i could manuever better and keep the attack constant before making theN move} Kd8 {i get a free pawn and its nealy over.  } 22. Qxf7 Qe7 {hoping for exchange of queens} 23. Ne6+ {there were simply too many attackers for his queen to defend against.  i think that blacks castling was the major point for whites advantage}
