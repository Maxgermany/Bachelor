1. d4 {This is why I lost the game...lol  I haven't played enough d4 games to know how to react :P} d5 2. c4 {Queen's gambit (just looked up the name...haha)} Bf5 {Focused on developing...not really sure what the standard moves are. I'm too lazy to read books and stuff.} 3. Nc3 {Developing and threatening d5} e6 {Developing and backup to d5} 4. Nf3 {Clop clop!} h6 {Not sure why I did this. Perhaps to prevent Bg5 or Ng5} 5. Bf4 {Developing bishop and placing it in a powerful position} Bd6 {Maybe Bb4 would've been a better move here (any insights?).} 6. e3 {White's development is much further than black's. You would think I would focus on getting the knights out and finishing up my development ... but...} Bxf4 {Pikachu knows best...I don't really like so many white control on e5. And this doubles pawn on f-file for white.} 7. exf4 {Getting material back} c6 {Usually I focus on developing knights before bishops...but like I said I was probably in a losing mood since 1. d4... haha  I should've probably focused on developing knights at this point} 8. Be2 {Preparing for a castle} Nf6 {Better late than never.} 9. O-O {Long live the king!} Qd6 {Okay, to anyone wondering why in the name of jellybeans I did this. I don't know. Usually when someone castles I start moving all my attacking pieces that way. This move was along those lines to attack the castle.} 10. Nh4 {Attacking the LSB} Qxf4 {Free pawn ahoy!} 11. Nf3 {Moving back to a safe spot. Blocks the bishop at e2 though. Perhaps Nxf5 would've been a better move here.} Ng4 {Attacking h2} 12. g3 {Removing threat to castle} Qd6 {c7 might've been better here} 13. c5 {...for this reason} Qc7 14. Nh4 {attacking bishop on f5 which is defending g4} h5 {defending g4} 15. Nxf5 {Taking out a bishop that's attacking a free diagonal, and doubles up pawn on the f-file} exf5 {Getting material back} 16. Re1 {Claiming the open e-file} Kd8 {Not quite sure why I did this. Castling may have been a better move.} 17. Qd3 {Putting pressure on f5??} g6 {Defending f5} 18. b4 {Not sure why this move was made. Maybe white wants to start attacking black's queenside?} Na6 {Black finally develops the knight but to a useless square...duh  Should've probably gone to d7} 19. a3 {Backing up the b4 pawn} h4 {attack on the castle...hoping to open the h-file} 20. Bxg4 {Taking out another threat to the castle} fxg4 {Getting material back} 21. Re2 {Perhaps to double up the rooks} Kd7 {Connecting rooks. I think Re8 may have been a better option} 22. Rae1 {Doubled rooks on an open file...oh dear} Rae8 {I wanted to break the double rook since it's a much bigger threat than my connected rooks} 23. Qd2 {This move was probably to get the queen to g5} Rxe2 {Breaking the double rooks} 24. Nxe2 {Getting material back while moving knight from a passive square...good move imo} Qd8 {I think this was to next move the queen to the h-file eventually} 25. Nf4 {Going on the offensive} hxg3 {Opening the h-file} 26. hxg3 {Getting material back} Kc8 {Moving to a safer place} 27. Nd3 {White's highly mobile knight is much more powerful than black's at this time.} Qf6 {Again with the h-file in mind. Plan was to get to f3 first} 28. Ne5 {Defending f3} Qf5 {Mobilizing towards h5} 29. a4 {Not sure why this was done. Most likely to bait me to move f6 because I didn't see the next set of moves coming...} f6 {Bait taken} 30. Nf7 {Step 1 of the "muhahaha strategy"} Rh7 {Saving private ryan} 31. Nd6+ {The Great Fork! I totally did not see this coming. At this point I thought with my poorly placed knight and black's rook on the open file I figured I did enough damage to my brain cells so I resigned. Maybe if I had kept on white would blunder which I could exploit, but seeing how the game had gone so far I think I would be more likely to blunder more ... lol  Thanks for reading if you have so far.}
