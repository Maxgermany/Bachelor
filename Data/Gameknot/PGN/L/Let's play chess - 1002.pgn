1. e4 {This is my same old boring opening for white e4.} c5 {Stillgar plays my ideal response of c5.  A very aggressive move challenging the middle of the board.} 2. Nf3 {I continue my boring opening attacking the middle of the board.  } Nc6 {Stillgar attacks right back continuing to be aggressive.  } 3. d4 {This is my way of being exciting while still doing my boring opening.  I keep saying my boring opening because I have not strayed from it for years.  I am challenging the middle of the board but really just offering trades and to keep the offensive.} cxd4 {In my mind by stillgar taking the d4 pawn he is excepting my trades.} 4. Nxd4 {Here I take the pawn thinking he is going to take my knight then I will bring my queen out.} Qa5+ {Instead stillgar continues to be aggressive bringing out his queen on the 4th move putting me in check.  In every book I have read(which is not many)  they all say not to bring the queen out to early.  In my experience this has been true because the queen gets bounced around while the other player brings more pieces out.  That in mind,  I have not played too many high ranking players and stillgar probably sees something I don't.} 5. Nc3 {I try to not let this check and him bringing out his queen phase me and continue my boring opening.  } Nxd4 {Stillgar continues to be very aggressive.  He decides to take the knight which is fine by me because I get to get out of my boring opening moves.} 6. Qxd4 {I of course take the knight with my queen giving me the advantage for a brief moment.  I continue to play safe waiting till I get more pieces out till I attack.} e5 {Although I am forced to move my queen I am still alright.  I have to big pieces out and am challenging the middle of the board.  I just have to be careful of the knight and make sure to pick a good spot for my queen.} 7. Qd5 {I choose to make a move and be aggressive in order to keep the offensive on my side challenging his queen.  Also trading queens would hopefully help me not allowing stillgar to utilize such a crucial piece.  This would also free up my knight for the moment if he takes my queen.} Bb4 {Stillgar is smart and no doubt sees what i am doing so takes the offensive back by threatening my knight while protecting his queen and now challenging my queen.  This doesn't allow me to sit and wait for him to take my queen advancing my pawn.} 8. Qxa5 {I decide then to trade queens because this will keep me on the offensive for the moment.} Bxa5 {At this point we are developed equally so I decide to continue to develop.} 9. Bc4 {I bring out the Bc4 a aggressive move in my mind.  Continuing to challenge the middle of the board.} Bxc3+ {This move I expected because stillgar has been aggressive the whole game.  Although I don't like doubling up my pawns I do like it's rewards.} 10. bxc3 {My only move is to take the bishop with my pawn which frees up the b row for an attack.} Nf6 {Right away stillgar has taken the offensive attacking the e4 pawn.} 11. f3 {My only move is to protect that pawn.} O-O {Stillgar has given up the offensive for now and decided to castle king side.  In my mind this is great because I have already placed the bishop in a great spot pinning the f7 pawn.} 12. Bg5 {I decide to make an aggressive move for better or worse. } Rb8 {Stillgar decides to ignore it for now and threaten the b7 pawns advancement.} 13. h4 {I decide to ignore the b7 pawn and continue to be aggressive bringing up the h4 pawn.} b5 {The b7 pawn is no longer an idea and is a threat and is pushing it's way while forcing me to protect my bishop.} 14. Be2 {I decide to play it safe to not get my bishop trapped on the b file.} Nh5 {Stillgar decides to get rid of the threat on the knight.} 15. g4 {Anticipating the fork of the bishop and knight I decide to push another pawn up forcing the inevitable.} Ng3 {I don't want my rook lost so I have to decide where to place it.} 16. Rg1 {I decide to force the inevitable again.} Nxe2 {My only option is to take the knight with the king.} 17. Kxe2 {I have lost the offensive for the moment.  On my notes at this point I tell my self that I am still in this game and to think 5 moves in advance.  To watch out for the doubled pawns and the open b file.  I also put in my notes to be aware of his rooks and bishop.  I do this because it's 17 moves in the game and I feel that I am still in this game and want to stay alert even if that means writing down silly notes.  When looking at the whole board I do see that he has a much better set up with his king very well protected.} Bb7 {Stillgar decides to ignore the pawn push on the b file and bring out the bishop attack.  Since there is no immediate threat this gives me a chance to go offensive.} 18. Be7 {While attacking the rook I am able to get out of any traps and protect my double pawns.} Rfe8 {Instead of protecting the doubled pawn right away I notice a better move.} 19. Bd6 {Moving Bd6 allows me to pin one rook and attack other.  This was probably not a better move then just protecting the doubled pawns right away.} Rbc8 {Stillgar decides to threaten the doubled pawns.} 20. Bb4 {My best move is to protect the pawn with the bishop instead of the king .} d5 {Stillgar decides to challenge the e5 pawn in hopes to open the d row or maybe even push the pawn further and attack the doubled pawns.} 21. exd5 {I decide to take the pawn to be on the offensive and not allow either scenario.} Bxd5 {He takes the pawn with his bishop only threatening 2 pawns that are already protected but opens up the d row.} 22. a4 {I decide to attack and try and open up the a row for my rook.} e4 {Stillgar pushes his pawn to e4 threatening to want to open up the e row and attack the king with his rook.  If he gets this done I will be in bad shape. } 23. f4 {In my mind this is my only choice witch allows me to push the pawns attacking and stop the open e row.} a6 {Stillgar moves up his pawn.  I don't know what plans he is conjuring up here but it's to tempting for me to take the pawn on b5 now.} 24. axb5 {I free up the a row witch is perfect for me.} axb5 {He takes the pawn.  Now I have to be weary of his pawn on the b row getting across.} 25. Ke3 {I decide to push my king forward stopping his pawn from moving forward.} f6 {Stillgar decides to start his pawns forward.} 26. Ra7 {I move my rook to the 7th row which traps his king on the 8th row.} Kh8 {He moves his king to the corner perhaps to make room for his rook.} 27. h5 {I decide to keep my pawn attack going forcing him to respond.  I have the control and hopefully I can keep it. } h6 {He decides to bring his h pawn forward giving him access to a spot on the 7th row.} 28. Rd7 {I decide to threaten his bishop to allow me to later bring my other rook on the d row allowing me to possibly get some trades going with the rooks.  At this point in the game I feel I have better position and so getting rid of those pieces would help.} Bc6 {Stillgar is forcing me to move my rook.  } 29. Rd6 {I decide to force him to move his bishop so I can bring in my other rook.} Red8 {Stillgar challenges my rook enticing me to take it.} 30. Rgd1 {Instead of taking his rook I decide to back-up my rook putting me in a better spot if he takes my rook.} Rxd6 {WOW!  Stillgar took the exchange and now I will proceed to keep trading believing and hoping I have better position.  } 31. Rxd6 {Now I have his bishop challenged and rook frozen.  I don't know what his next move will be. } Kg8 {Sillgar is bringing out his king perhaps thinking of the end game.} 32. f5 {I push up my pawn waiting to make my move.  I'm in a tricky spot I have more pieces across the middle but the tables could turn very easily.} Ba8 {Stillgar moves his bishop out of the way perhaps to relive his rook for movement.} 33. Ba5 {I decide to make my move and putting my bishop on the end I threaten check and also allow for a trade with the rooks.  I feel the more pieces I can get of the board the better position I have.} Kf8 {Stillgar continues to bring his king closer for the end game.} 34. Rd8+ {I decide to put him in check to trade rooks because I feel I have better position for the end game.} Rxd8 {He accepts.} 35. Bxd8 {Here we go.} Ke8 {Stillgar is forcing me to move my bishop which is alright by me.} 36. Ba5 {I move my bishop back to protect my pawns and get away from his king.} Bd5 {Stillgar is pushing his bishop up in hopes to possibly attack.} 37. Kd4 {I bring my king up to push him away so I can attack with my c pawn.} Bb7 {Stillgar pushes back his bishop as expected.} 38. c4 {I make my move with c4 attacking his b5 pawn.  I have my king at a great spot.} bxc4 {Stillgar takes the pawn.} 39. Kxc4 {I take his pawn with my king leaving his pawn free on the e file.  I am alright with that because I have my bishop protecting the e1 spot.  Now I can concentrate on bringing my pawn up on the c file or attacking on the other side of the board.  I must be careful because all my pawns are on white squares so they are at risk with stillgar's bishop.} e3 {He brings up his pawn threatening an upgrade.} 40. Kd4 {I bring my king over to attack and advance.} Bf3 {I was not prepared for that.} 41. Kxe3 {I take his pawn but feel the tides are turning.} Bxg4 {He proceeds to take my pawn and threaten more.} 42. Kf4 {I bring my king up in hopes to protect pieces.} Bxh5 {Just like that the game already feels over.  I really felt over when he moved his bishop on f3.  It was probably over sooner.} 43. c4 {I try to make a final attempt to put pressure on.} Bf7 {Stilgar makes way for the pawn attack.} 44. c5 {The rest you can just watch Stilgar at work.} Kd7 45.
