[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), modern variation"]

1. b3 {I open this game with an unusual opening, hoping to draw Black into a variation he's uncomfortable with. My goal is to control the flanks and at the correct time, make a decisive central thrust.} e5 2. Bb2 d6 {Black plays rather passively. 2...Nc6 develops a piece and preserves the option of moving the d-pawn 2 squares.} 3. e4 Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 {With Black having 2 pawns on the central dark squares, 4...c5! seems to be indicated. Afterwards, the plan would be to move the Queen Knight to c6 and d4, centralizing it nicely.} 5. Nf3 h6 6. d4 {If Black's c-pawn were at c5, White could not make this central thrust.} exd4 7. Nxd4 {Now it is White's knight that is centralized.} Bg4 8. Be2 Bxe2 9. Qxe2 Be7 {White has an advantage in development and controls more space.} 10. O-O Nbd7 11. Nf5 O-O 12. Nxe7+ {I gain a minor exchange.} Qxe7 13. Rad1 Nc5 14. f3 {Preventing ...Ng4, with potential disruption of the King's defenses.} Nh5 15. Bc1 Qf6 16. Na4 Nxa4 17. bxa4 {I weaken my Queen-side Pawn structure, but trade off a minor piece. The objective is to remove the Queens and exploit the advantage of a Bishop against a Knight in the endgame.} Nf4 18. Bxf4 Qxf4 {A clever little attack by Black has neutralized my long-term threat.} 19. Qd2 Qxd2 20. Rxd2 {I exchange Queens anyway, playing for a draw... unless my opponent blunders.} Rad8 21. Rfd1 g6 {Now I can not only win a Pawn, but threaten to trade off a pair of Rooks in doing so.} 22. Rd2xd6 Rxd6 23. Rxd6 {I'm up one Pawn in a Rook endgame. With exact play, Black can hold the position, but I have a definite advantage.} h5 24. h3 Re8 25. Rd7 Rb8 {Now I have Black on the defensive. I'm starting to like my chances.} 26. a5 a6 27. Kf2 {Have to centralize the King...} b5 28. Ke3 {If I capture en passant instead, I give Black's Rook an open file and mobilize it. I feel keeping the doubled Pawn is the lesser drawback.} c5 29. a3 b4 {Now I can undouble the Pawns without giving up a fully open file.} 30. axb4 cxb4 31. Rd6 {Once again, I force Black's Rook into a defensive posture.} Ra8 32. Rb6 {Another of Black's Pawns will fall. Up 2 Pawns in a Rook endgame, it's now just a matter of time.} b3 33. Rxb3 {If I capture with the Pawn instead, I don't get a passed Pawn on the Queen-side.} Rc8 34. Kd3 Rc5 35. Ra3 f6 36. c4 {The passed Pawn begins its march...} Rg5 37. Ra2 {Black attacks, and I riposte.} f5 {This move severely restricts the mobility of Black's Rook. There will be consequences...} 38. e5 {I'm not about to capture and free up Black's immured Rook.} f4 39. Ke4 {Black's only chance is to free his Rook with Rf5 followed by Rf8.} h4 40. c5 {The Pawn marches towards the eighth rank.} Kf7 41. Rd2 {Now Black's King is cut off from the menacing passed Pawn.} Ke6 42. Rd5 {42...Rxg2 would be followed up with 43 Kxf4, and with TWO passed Pawns to defend, on the c and e files, Black's task would be monumental.} Ke7 {A major blunder. Black needed to get his Rook to the eighth rank to cut off the passed Pawn.} 43. c6 Rh5 {Too late!} 44. c7 {Black resigns. If 44...Rh8, White follows up with 45 Rd8 Rxd8 46 cxd8=Q Kxd8 47 Kxf4, and Black's King-side Pawns fall. }
