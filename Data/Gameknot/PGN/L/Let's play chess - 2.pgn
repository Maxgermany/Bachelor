[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 {This game features an open Sicilian and the variation 7. f3, which is a very popular line at club level.  If Black acts quickly in the center, then the position is dead even, however, in this game, White doesnt respond accurately and Black gets a winning attack.} c5 2. Nf3 g6 {The Hyper-Accelerated Dragon, as in this game, will most often times transpose into a full-fleged Accelerated Dragon.  However, there are independent deviations as early as move 3.} 3. d4 {The willingness of the White player to to exchange the d-pawn for the c-pawn means that we are heading for the open lines of the Accelerated Dragon.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Be3 {More typical is 5. Nf3, or 5. c4} Nf6 {Now White is forced to defend the e-pawn with either 6. Nc3 or 6. f3, retaining the possibility of playing the Maroczy Bind after 7. c4} 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. f3 {A very popular system at club level, however, Black equalizes with a quick d5.  White can head into the dangerous Yugoslav attack with Bc4, which prevents d5, but allows Black to play 7...Qa5, a potent anti-Yugoslav system.} O-O {Necessary as a precursor to d5, as the immediate center break is met with 8. Bb5.} 8. Qd2 {Preparing to exchange the dark-squared bishops, castle queenside and launch the kingside pawns.  Very similar to the Yugoslav attack, however, Black detonates the center with...} d5 {Jeremy Silman and John Donaldson both agree that Black has equalized with this center break.} 9. Nxc6 {The second main continuation is 9. ed Nxd5 10. Nxc6 bc 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 12. 0-0-0, with equality.} bxc6 10. O-O-O {Castling right into Black's open lines on the Queenside is not a good idea.  The main continuation is 10. e5 Nd7 11. f4 e6 when Black is going to play c5 in the near future with a spatial advantage on the Queenside and a quicker attack.  Note that 12. Na4?? is met with 12...Nxe5 as 13. fxe5 Qh4  and the N on a4 hangs.} Qa5 {Getting the attack underway without hesitation.} 11. e5 Nd7 {This move is preferable to 11...Ne8 as Black now has ...c5 in the cards.  This move also forces 12. f4, locking up the center.  Now Black's attack is faster.} 12. f4 e6 {Strengthening d5 before the c5 push.} 13. Qe1 {Preparing to transfer the Queen to the kingside for some much needed counterplay.  } f6 {I had just watched Jacob Aagards video on conducting an attack and decided to follow the lesson, "bring all of your pieces into the attack."  The dark-square bishop is too important to leave out and this move will give Black another strategic asset, control of the center and a sweeping pawn roller.} 14. exf6 Nxf6 {The only recapture that doesn't allow White to swap dark-squared bishops.} 15. Bd4 {Pointless, as c5 is coming anyway, now Black plays it with tempo.} c5 16. Bxf6 {One square too many, 16. Be5 looks stronger, pinning the knight to the g7 bishop and keeping the Black Queen's rook off of b8.} Rxf6 {This move loses a pawn and the exchange, but leads to a winning attack!!! I looked at the resulting game after 16...Bxf6 17. Nxd5 Qxa2 18. Nxf6  Rxf6, and while Black still has a slight advantage, I came to the conclusion that the Bishop was going to be more of an asset than the f8 rook.} 17. Nxd5 Qxa2 18. Nxf6+ Bxf6 {Black has the initiative.} 19. Kd2 Qxb2 {Winning back the pawn, driving the King into the open and creating a rook file passer as insurance.} 20. Qe3 {White has to try to mobilize his army and protect his King.} Bb7 {Sacrificing another pawn with check to open the center files for the full weight of the remaining Black army.} 21. Qxe6+ Kh8 22. Bd3 {Giving the pawn back for development.} Bxg2 23. Rhg1 Bc3+ 24. Ke2 Qb7 {Mate threat on f3.} 25. Rgf1 Bd4 {Keeping the rook off of f2 and preventing the White King from finding any safety on the Kingside.} 26. Rdb1 Bxf1+ 27. Rxf1 Qg2+ {Black's last few moves has cut the White King off from the relative safety of the Kingside, now he will be driven to the open lines of the Queenside where he will me mated or be forced to give up material.} 28. Kd1 Rb8 29. c4 Qa2 30. f5 Bc3 31. Qe3 Qa4+ 32. Kc1 {Black has been able to drag the King into the mating net.} Qa1+ 33. Kc2 Rb2+ 34. Kxc3 Qa3# {}
