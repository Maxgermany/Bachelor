[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed, 2...Nc6"]

1. e4 {The winner of the game of the season winter 2015/2016 for the "Sixth Sense" team is Nairobigal. I am annotating it at the request of the lovely elenapetrova - I never can resist her when she asks me to do something!} c5 {So it starts as a Sicilian Defence.} 2. Nc3 {White appears to be heading for a closed variation.} Nc6 {Black does the same developing move.} 3. Nf3 {White gets her other knight out.} d6 {It is wise to play this before Nf6, otherwise black may be faced with e4-e5.} 4. a3 {This is a very unusual move, but not completely unheard of.} Nf6 {Black wisely continues to develop.} 5. b4 {This is a rather unusual pawn sacrifice - again, not completely unheard of. White sacrifices a pawn to open up files on the queen side and to lure balck's c pawn away from the centre. It does have some similarities with the Benko Gambit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benko_Gambit} cxb4 {So black takes.} 6. axb4 {White takes back.} Nxb4 {and now black accepts the pawn gambit.} 7. h4 {This is just a complete beginners move and carries no merit. White wins despite this move, not because of it. Sometimes this thrust is justified, if black has played g7-g6, but as black hasn't played that move, this is just a random thrust on the king side. White could, and should, have taken the centre with d2-d4 as in another game with this variation, which ended in a draw,- 7. d4 Qc7 8. Bb2 Nxe4 9. Nxe4 Nxc2+ 10. Kd2 Nxa1 11. Qxa1 Bf5 12. Qa4+ Bd7 13. Bb5 Bxb5 14. Qxb5+ Qc6 15. Qd3 Qb6 16. Bc3 e6 17. Rb1 Qc7 18. d5 e5 19. Bxe5 dxe5 20. d6 Qa5+ 21. Ke2 b6 22. Rb5 Qa2+ 23. Ned2 f6 24. Qc3 Bxd6 25. Qc6+ Ke7 26. Qb7+ Ke6 27. Qxg7 Qa6 28. Qg4+ f5 29. Qc4+ Kf6 30. Qh4+ Kf7 31. Ng5+ Kg6 32. Qc4 Kxg5 33. f4+ Kf6 34. fxe5+ Bxe5 35. Qc6+ Ke7 36. Nc4 Qa2+ 37. Kf3 Bf6 38. Qb7+ Ke6 39. Qd5+ Ke7 40. Qb7+ Ke6 41. Qd5+ Ke7} e5 {Black wisely grabs some central control.} 8. g3 {I'm not sure of the reason for this move - maybe to give some protection to the pawn on h4? Maybe to develop the Bf1 to g2 or h3? c4 is also a good square to place the Bf1.} b6 {This is also a waste of time.Bg4 looks best.} 9. Bc4 {Bishop moves to an attacking square.} h6 {Another complete waste of time when black should be getting his pieces out.} 10. h5 {This pawn thrust doesn't seem to achieve much.} Bg4 {Black finally develops a piece! Well done!} 11. Bb5+ {This is mind-boggling. If black wanted to play this check, she could have done it on any of her last 3 moves. By playing this bishop to c4 first, she has wasted a move.} Ke7 {Black doesn't want to retreat any of his pieces.} 12. Ra4 {White hits the knight.} Bxf3 {Black now wins a pawn, but gives up his lovely bishop on g4. Better was a5.} 13. Qxf3 Nxc2+ {This is the pawn black was after.} 14. Kd1 {White attacks the knight. Coutner attacking with a6 looks best here, but black does the obvious move. } Nd4 {This. However, now white has a simple with 15. Rxd4 exd4 16. Nd5+ Nxd5 (if instead Ke6 then 17. Qf5 mate) 17. exd5 and the threat of Re1 is overwhelming.} 15. Qd3 {But white plays this instead. } Nb3 {This is yet another mistake. Black could have got rid of the dangerous bishop on b5 with Nxb5 or just tried to develop his king-side. The threat of Nc5 attacking rook and queen and so winning the exchange is easily parried.} 16. Qc4 {But this is not the best way to do it, better Ba3, developing the Bc1.} Na5 {Black counters with an attack on the white queen, but the knight is out of play here.} 17. Qa2 {The Gameknot post-game computer analysis criticises this move, and suggests Qd3 as better, but I think it is wrong, as surely black can then reply with Nb3 again, threatening to come into c5 again. What do you think dear reader?} Ng4 {Another wild swipe, this time at f2 which achieves little. Black should play a6 18. Be2 Qd7 19. Bb2 Ke8 20. Ke1 Qc6 21. Rh4 Qb7 22. Kf1 Be7 23. d4 Rc8 24. Rb4 d5 and at last most of his pieces are getting to reasonable squares.} 18. Rf1 {White meekly protects f2, missing 18. Nd5+ Ke6 19. Nxb6+ Kf6 20. Nd5+ Ke6 21. Ne3+ Ke7 22. Nxg4 winning easily.} Nf6 {Black now stops that - wasting another move in the process - but this was best.} 19. Nd5+ {White plays the check anyway. Better is f2-f4 tearing open the centre.} Nxd5 {This is more or less forced.} 20. Qxd5 {White correctly takes back with the queen, and maintains her advantage, rather than with the pawn, which would have thrown away her advantage.} a6 {This is another mistake, better is Qc7, to give the black king a flight square.} 21. Bc4 {With a horrible threat of Qcf7 mate!} Nxc4 {So black takes the bishop off.} 22. Qxc4 {Better is to take with the rook, to avoid the fork which follows.} b5 {White will now lose a whole rook.} 23. Qd5 {White queen resumes her dominating role in the centre.} bxa4 {Black takes the rook.} 24. Qb7+ {This is a good move, as Qd7 loses the rook on a8, however the Gameknot computer seems to think this is the best idea of black, and gives Qd7 25. Qxa8 Qb5 26. Ke1 Qc4 27. Ba3 Qb3 28. Qa7+ Kf6 29. Qa8 Rh7 30. Qxf8 Qb1+ 31. Bc1 Qxc1+ 32. Ke2 Qc6 33. Qd8+ Ke6 34. d3 as best for both sides, with advantage to black.} Kf6 {Black has to be really careful, walking his king into the middle of the board like this.} 25. f4 {This is a great move, trying to open more files against the black king.} exf4 {This is a terrible mistake, allowing mate in three. Gameknot gives Qe8 26. d3 g6 27. fxe5+ Kg7 28. exd6 Rb8 29. Bb2+ Kg8 30. d7 Qd8 31. Qd5 Rh7 32. hxg6 Rxb2 33. gxh7+ Kxh7 34. Rxf7+ Bg7 with advantage to black.} 26. Rxf4+ {Another great move by white. Black is now mated in all variations.} Ke6 {Or Kg5 27. Qd5+ f5 28. Qxf5#} 27. Qxf7+ {White polishes black off nicely now. If now Ke5 then Qd5 mate!
