1. e4 {This was one of my greatest games, enjoy!} d5 {Scandinavian, better than Sicilian or 1.e5 for me.} 2. e5 {My opponent doesn't comply so...} f6 3. exf6 {Now i thought about gxf6 or nxf6, i chose the knight.} Nxf6 4. Qf3 {kinda purposeless, and a little bit early.} e5 {Taking full control of the center.} 5. Bb5+ {C6, nothing special.} c6 6. Ba4 Bg4 {Striking at the queen and developing with tempo.} 7. Qb3 {aiming b7 but that is no problem} Na6 {If qxb7 then nc5 and after that rb8, it is worth for that pawn.} 8. Qg3 {so my opponent makes a strange move again with no purpose.} Bd6 {Trying an e4 next move.} 9. h3 {If he attacks my bishop then i attack his :).} Nc5 10. hxg4 {Exchange.} Nxa4 11. Qf3 {he really likes to move his queen around.} e4 {And the queen is harassed yet again.} 12. Qd1 {Queen back, very very strange.} O-O {Castle, with thoughts of moving the knight on f6.} 13. b3 {Attacking my knight, not that would be a problem in the near future, I really wanted to move that knight.} Nc5 14. Ba3 {Again putting pressure on the knight.} Qd7 {Threatening the g4 pawn.} 15. b4 {He attacks my knight} Na6 {That is a bit awkward but i want to maintain the pressure on g4.} 16. Nc3 {Developing for him, at last.} Bxb4 17. Bxb4 Nxb4 18. g5 {He saw the threat on g4 and attacks my knight.} Ng4 {Maybe f6?} 19. g6 {H6...} h6 20. Rh4 {He attacks my knight twice but f2 is falling now.} Nxf2 {With a knight like that white is in serious trouble.} 21. Qb1 {Materialistic. } Qe7 {Aiming the rook and protecting the knight.} 22. Qb3 {???} Qxh4 {Rook for free and a check mate coming, not so free but he didn't captured my knight because he was concerned about his king.} 23. Ke2 {Is he drunk or something?} Qg4+ 24. Ke1 {Mate in two! } Nfd3+ {First, just tasting the field.} 25. cxd3 Nxd3# {             I really liked this game, some pieces didn't even move, my rook on a8 and his knight and rook on g1 and a1.              I found this ending very nice, besides of my weak playing, fortunately my opponent played weaker.              This was one of my few wins here at G.K. And I posted this only for this checkmate, with his helpless queen on the table and the knight sack.              Hope you enjoyed the game!       }
