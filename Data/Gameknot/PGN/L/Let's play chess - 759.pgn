[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D00)"]

1. d4 d5 {The queen's pawn game. This is my second choice opening as black, as my queen has partial freedom, although I shouldn't develop her too early...} 2. f4 {...although I'm not sure why my opponent would move out the pawn staring in front of this bishop on the kingside. This may have been a waste of a move, or is there a plot developing?} Nc6 {I take advantage of this move by bringing out a knight. I have more control of the centre, although the e5 square is mainly controlled by my opponent, and I'm not trying to take the pawn on d4, as the queen is protecting it.} 3. Nf3 {My opponent has responded to this move by bringing out a knight, also, having much more control of e5. I have limited options among the centre...} Nf6 {...so I bring out my other knight, to attack the e4 square, and to cover my pawn...} 4. Nc3 {...as my opponent does likewise, contesting d5 and e4...} Ne4 {I am hoping to get a knight exchange here, to get the pawn off its file, although this may have been a little dodgy, although the doubled pawns on the e-file could support my KBP, with one being so far advanced...} 5. Nxe4 dxe4 {...and we do end up exchanging knights, with me having doubled paws on the e-file, after six consecutive knight moves. These pawns are relatively strong, as my KBP is still in its starting position, so they can potentially support it. My opponent's remaining knight is actually under attack from the pawn...} 6. Ne5 Nxd4 {...but although my opponent offers it as bait to my own knight, I capture the pawn instead, to get ahead. I think that was quite a good move, as my knight is the only piece between the queens, and should it retreat back to its old square, a queen exchange is possible, although it may have been a little dodgy, with the possibility of doubled isolated pawns on the c-file, along with an isolated pawn on a7, even if I do have an extra pawn...} 7. e3 Nc6 8. Nxc6 {...and this is exactly what happens. My pawn structure is about to be distorted, despite having an extra pawn, even if I am the only player who could castle. Also notice that eight of the last nine moves were made by knights...} Qxd1+ 9. Kxd1 {...and I decide to do the queen exchange first...} bxc6 {...then complete the knight exchange. I felt I was in a little difficulty, despite being a pawn up, with my inferior queenside formation, although my doubled pawns on e4 and e7 are stronger.} 10. Bc4 e6 {With my opponent getting out a bishop, I decide to free up my dark-square bishop, and to get a more powerful hold on the d5 square, but this may have been a bit of a bad move, as my light-square bishop is blocked in...} 11. h3 Bd6 {...and I bring up my dark-square bishop to undouble my pawns on the e-file, as advancing my king's pawn would attack the pawn on f4, causing it to disappear...} 12. Bd2 e5 13. fxe5 Bxe5 {...and I do indeed get the pawn trade, isolating the pawn on e3. My light-square bishop is now free, although placing it on e6 would be a mistake, as I would end up with isolated doubled pawns...} 14. c3 O-O {...so I castle kingside to bring a rook into play, so I could then move it one space to the right to exchange bishops...} 15. Kc2 Re8 16. Rad1 Be6 17. Bxe6 Rxe6 {...and I get the exchange, making the light squares safer. My rook also defends the pawn on c6, and I'm also hoping to exchange a pair of rooks, or get one onto the 7th rank...} 18. Rhf1 Rf6 {...so I contest the half-open file, hoping to exchange a pair of rooks, where I'd use my bishop, to keep my kingside pawns in single file...} 19. Rfg1 {...but my opponent declines to take my rook...} Rf2 {...so I advance mine to the 7th rank, pinning the bishop down. I think this was a strong move by me, forcing the rooks into passive positions, as the KNP is also under attack...} 20. a3 Bh2 {...and my bishop can join in, attacking the rook, which could either win a pawn, or get an exchange. If I did Rd8, I couldn't take the pinned bishop, as I'd lose the exchange...} 21. Rgf1 {...and as my opponent places my rook under attack...} Rxf1 22. Rxf1 {...I decide to exchange. I still hold a single pawn advantage, incredibly, although my bishop is high up the board...} Re8 {...so I decide to bring my other rook into play.} 23. g4 Re6 24. g5 {This move may have played into my hands here: with that pawn so far advanced, I can now cause the kingside formation to crumble by playing h6...} Kf8 {...but moving my king so he can get off his starting rank was vital here: my opponent could do Rf6-b6/d6-b8/d8 for a rank checkmate, and my king is less advanced than my opponent's, I thought he should move so my rook and bishop can remain more active...} 25. Kb3 {...and I thought my opponent's king may now threaten my isolated queenside pawns, although only the rook's pawn on a7 is unprotected, as my c7-pawn is protected by my bishop, and my c6-pawn by my rook...} Rg6 {...but I felt this move was a good diversion: threatening the most advanced pawn, to potentially isolate the rook's pawn on the kingside...} 26. h4 {...as it advances to protect its neighbour...} Bg3 {...so I threaten it with my bishop...} 27. Be1 Bxe1 28. Rxe1 {...and I couldn't resist trading our bishops, having an extra pawn. My c7-pawn has actually lost the protection it had, and we have a single rook and pawn endgame, where I have a 7-6 pawn advantage, but I have three which are isolated and weak, and my opponent has one.} h6 {I thought this was the best move I could have made: I am trying to isolate the kingside pawns to set mine away...} 29. gxh6 Rxh6 {...and I get the exchange. Notice that I used the rook to recapture, to keep my pawns connected, to support each other up the board, and my rook is also threatening the isolated pawn on h4...} 30. Rh1 {...so the rook moves behind the pawn to cover it.} Ke7 31. Kc4 Rh5 {Moving my rook to the fourth rank stops the king from threatening my isolated pawns, as he cannot advance any further.} 32. Kd4 {However, he threatens my most advanced pawn...} f5 {...so I decide to cover it with my bishop's pawn. This was a very dodgy move by me, as the king can now threaten my isolated pawns, as the rook's path is blocked.} 33. b4 {However, my opponent decides to advance a pawn instead...} g5 {...allowing me to threaten the isolated rook's pawn on h4. As the pawn on h4 is the only piece between the two rooks, this was quite a forceful move.} 34. Rg1 {Now with the rook attacking the pawn...} Kf6 {...my king must help his rook out. I was unsure as to whether or not my last two moves were good ones here, as 35. hxg5+ Rxg5 36. Rh1 may have been a little problematic for me, although I could play 36... Kg7 to prevent the rook from penetrating...} 35. hxg5+ Rxg5 {...and as expected, we trade our pawns...} 36. Rxg5 Kxg5 {...but my opponent gave up the rook exchange, here, as should the king threaten my pawns on c6, c7 and a7, I can set my pawn on e4 free by playing f4, inviting a trade, so my e4-pawn can advance. I'm sure that only a queen could deal with the queenside pawns alone, as she has the most mobility.} 37. Kc5 f4 38. exf4+ Kxf4 {I anticipated these moves, so I can now set my pawn away. I felt as though I was in a 50/50 situation here, wondering whether or not my new queen could deal with the connected pawns...} 39. Kxc6 e3 40. Kxc7 {...and I certainly anticipated that my opponent would finally remove my doubled pawns...} e2 41. Kb7 e1=Q {...however, I get my queen. I was positive she could deal with all three pawns, due to her mobility...} 42. c4 Qe4+ {...as the advance of the bishop's pawn allowed her to fork it, along with the king...} 43. Kxa7 Qxc4 {...so she can eliminate the pawn, despite the king eliminating my last pawn. My queen can also fork the other two pawns, and eliminate another. I was right all along, especially as the queen has four straight lines in both directions on which she can attack.} 44. Kb6 Qb3 45. b5 Qxa3 {Now with my opponent only having one pawn left, I must either first stop it, or mate.} 46. Kc6 Qa8+ {I place my queen down here to guard the pawn's queening square, and to distract the king. In at most two moves, the queen can threaten the pawn on its file: two if the king moves to c7: the queen checks on a7, then moves either to b8 (if he moves to c6) or b6 otherwise, one if he moves to another available square.} 47. Kc5 Qb7 {Also the queen is on her potential mating file here...} 48. b6 Ke5 49. Kb5 Kd4 50. Ka5 Kc4 51. Ka4 Qa6# {...so I use my king to close the enemy down, then use my queen to complete the mate. I don't know if I could have mated faster; I had to stop the pawn from queening. And I used the conditional move feature to do most of these moves. Yet again, I got away with doubled and isolated pawns.}
