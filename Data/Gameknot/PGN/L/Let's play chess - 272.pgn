[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {So, heres an exciting game which i played against campeon. White wins blacks queen at the beginning , and soon after sacs a piece for a fierce attack on black. This is how it went down. I start with my usual d4.} h6 {h6?? Not really a stereotypical opening move} 2. e4 {I decided to jump on the fact that black is not trying to control the center.} d5 3. exd5 {This move allows white to gain a tempo and gain major control over the center} Qxd5 4. c4 {Attacks blacks queen and jumps on center} Qe4+ {I was expecting queen to retreat all the way to d8} 5. Be3 e6 6. a3 {With this move i wanted to secure my tempo gain with the knight, by avoiding the pin} Nf6 7. Nc3 Qc6 8. c5 {This move comes with a thread my opponet failed to reckon} Nd5 9. Bb5 {The queen is pinned to the king} Nxc3 {This doesnt work because bxc6 comes with check} 10. Bxc6+ bxc6 11. bxc3 Nd7 12. Nf3 {This was an odd position becuse both player have doubled pawns on the c file} Be7 13. O-O Ba6 {Just helps white to develop his rook} 14. Re1 Bc4 {Another wasted move} 15. Rb1 O-O 16. Qc2 Nf6 17. Qd2 {Preparing to sac on h6} Nd5 18. Bxh6 gxh6 19. Qxh6 {Blacks king side is torn apart and white is readh bring reinforcements in to the attack} Bf6 20. Re4 {Threatening rg4+ with mate to follow} Bd3 {Allows bg6 to block the check} 21. Rg4+ Bg6 22. h4 {Maybe nh4 was better} Bg7 {Only move really} 23. Qg5 {I thought about saccing the exchange instantly but decided to virtually pinn blacks lsb} Nf6 {Whites both rooks attacked here} 24. Rb7 {Only move really because after nxg4 blacks lsb is unpinned and free to grab the rook} Nxg4 25. Qxg4 Kh8 {Defends against h5 winnimg a piece} 26. Rxc7 Rfg8 27. Rxc6 {White grabs 2 pawns and is still clearly winning} Rab8 28. Ra6 Rb1+ 29. Kh2 Rb3 {Maybe blacks shouldnt be going for whites pawns here} 30. Rxa7 Rxc3 31. a4 Rc4 {Pins the d pawn but other than thag does nothing} 32. a5 e5 33. h5 Bh7 {Ops, blacks king is trapped} 34. Re7 e4 {Game losing blunder} 35. Ng5 {Ng5!! Threatens instant mate and forces a mate in a couple of moves} Rf8 {Only delays things} 36. Nxf7+ Kg8 {Rxf7 wont help because after rxf7 its a mate in two} 37. Nh6+ Kh8 38. Qxg7# {Hope you enjoyed the annotation }
