1. d4 {SO heresy another game of mine where i manage to turn a losing game into a checkmate through quite a nice combination(at least i think it is nice). Starting with d4 this the queens gambit, I've been playing it alot lately and had some success with it.} d5 2. c4 Bg4 {this move kinda took me by surprise , i hadn't thought that he would pin my e pawn move 2.} 3. h3 Bh5 4.

Bd2 {now threatening kd5 winning the queen.} Qc5 21. g5 {here this pawn has to be taken with h-pawn, because if 21..hxg  22.bxg6.... followed by 23.qf7 mate.} hxg5 22. Bxg5 {this bishop is immune because of the mate thread on f7.} Nd7 23. Rd2 {preparing to double the rooks on d-file adding more pressure on white.} Kd8 24. Ne4 {again chasing the queen.} Qa5 25.
