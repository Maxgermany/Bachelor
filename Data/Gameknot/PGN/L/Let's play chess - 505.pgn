1. e4 e6 {I always prefered the frech, to some complications of e5 (?)} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {I think this is the worst variation for white, 3.Nc3 well played, accomplish a really nice position, which I personally like.} c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. Na3 {Not the normal continuation here, but also playable} cxd4 7. cxd4 Bb4+ {The incovinient of 6.Na3. Now white has to choose,  if they wanna get in a position which they are one pawn down, or give up castling.} 8. Bd2 {They prefered to loose the d4 pawn} Bxa3 {This move must be played! If 8...Nd5 9.Nd5 10 Qd5 11Da4+ wins a piece!} 9. bxa3 Nxd4 10. Rb1 {10.Nxd5, was better i guess} Nxf3+ 11. gxf3 Qd8 {11.Qc8 leaves to 12.Tc1, loosing a tempo} 12. Bb5+ Bd7 13. a4 a5 {I think this move is absolutly needed! If i played something else, i guess 14.Bb4, is a little annoying don't you think? [;)]} 14. O-O Ne7 15. Kh1 O-O 16. Rg1 Ng6 17. f4 Bxb5 {Here I consider if he played 17.Rxb5, i would be in some troubles, but that white bishop was really annoying me [:p]} 18. axb5 {?} b6 {Didn't want to take the risk of seeing him playing b6} 19. a4 Rc8 20. Qg4 {Leeving the opportunity to occupy the seventh rank} Rc2 21. Be3 Qc7 22. f5 exf5 23. Qxf5 Qb7 {mistake ....23.Qxc2 wins at least a rook for a bishop...} 24. e6 Rcc8 25. Qg4 {??} d4+ 26. f3 dxe3 27. Rbe1 Rc3 28. Qd4 Qxf3+ 29. Rg2 Rc2 30. Reg1 Rxg2 31. Rxg2 e2 32. e7 e1=Q+ {Thank you for watching. Comment and analyse if you want to!}
