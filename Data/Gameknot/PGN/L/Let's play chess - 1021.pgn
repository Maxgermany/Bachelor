1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d4 e6 3. e3 {Why not c4 here? It would stake claim to some of the center immediately.} d5 4. c4 Bb4+ {Similar to the Bogo-Indian but made with the Samisch variation in mind. 3. e3 allows for the exchange of bishops without the doubling of pawns commonly associated with the Samisch.} 5. Bd2 Bxd2+ {Exchanging the bishops made me very happy. It makes it a little harder to attack the kingside with bishop-queen barrage.} 6. Nbxd2 {Why did White not take with the Queen and just simply develop on the next move with Nc3? I suspect he was expecting me to take the c pawn, and after taking with the bishop to follow up with e4 posting control over the center.} c5 {Immediately challenging the d4. I think this move was better then dxc4 in that it at least develops a piece and gains space.} 7. Nb3 cxd4 8. Nfxd4 {I suppose this move was a matter of taste. Nbxd4 would have been acceptable as well I suspect. At least with Nbxd4 White would cover the e5 square in preparation to the eventual pawn push.} dxc4 {This move violates one of those addressed in My System. It allows for White to exchange while developing a piece. Perhaps Nc6 would have been in order to challenge the knight and possibly building a pawn chain after the exchanges of the knights.} 9. Bxc4 O-O 10. O-O a6 {A development move was in order at this point. By playing e5 would have lead to the exchange of the queens but since White is more developed, he would have been in better shape come the endgame ruling out this move. Interesting was Nbd7, however it blocks in the bishop.} 11. Qf3 {This move makes it impossible to play Nc6 right away since White would win the pawn after the exchange. The move also prevents Bd7 with the hope of playing Nc6 under more favorable conditions.} Qe7 {Over-protection of the b7 allowing for Nc6 again after Bd7.} 12. Na5 Nc6 13. Naxc6 bxc6 14. Nxc6 Qb7 15. b3 Bd7 16. Ne5 Qxf3 17. Nxf3 Bb5 18. Ne5 Rfd8 19. Rfd1 Rxd1+ 20. Rxd1 Ne4 21. a4 Bxc4 22. Nxc4 Kf8 23. f3 Nc5 24. Rb1 Rb8 25. Nd2 Ke7 26. Kf2 f5 27. Ke2 e5 28. e4 f4 29. a5 g5 30. b4 Na4 31. Kf2 h5 32. g3 h4 33. gxh4 gxh4 34. h3 Nc3 35. Rb3 Na4 36. Nc4 Nc5 37. Rb1 Rxb4 38. Rxb4 Nd3+ 39. Ke2 Nxb4 40. Nxe5 Kf6 41. Nd3 Nc6 42. Nxf4 Nxa5 43. Nd5+ Ke5 44. Nb4 Nc4 45. Nxa6 Kf4 46. Nb4 Kg3 47. Nd3 Kxh3 48. Kf2 Nd2 49. e5 Nxf3 50. Kxf3 Kh2 51. Nf4 {Black resigns here with the idea that he will not be allowed to advance his pawn while White promotes to queen and wins easily.}
