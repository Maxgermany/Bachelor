1. Nf3 h5 2. e4 Rh6 {Never a good idea.  Almost never.} 3. Bc4 e6 4. d4 c5 {Ok, what have you got against your king's rook?} 5. Ne5 {No.  BxRh6!  Rooks are worth more than bishops.  Trade up, man!  Fill your boots!} Qc7 6. Bxh6 {Finally!  } gxh6 {NxBh6 would have at least preserved the pawn structure.  Doubled rook pawns are cannon fodder.} 7. Nc3 Qa5 8. Qf3 {Watch out for QxPf7.  } h4 {?  That is going to cost a pawn, bishop, AND knight.  Slaughter of all the king's men.} 9. Qxf7+ Kd8 10. Qxf8+ Kc7 11. Qxg8 Qb4 12. Kd2 cxd4 {Pd6 I think leads to a knight or bishop.  Though yeah, looks like you got Nc3.  Probably better.} 13. Rab1 dxc3+ 14. bxc3 Qxb1 {No!  Why?  } 15. Rxb1 d6 16. Nf7 Kc6 17. Nxh6 Kc5 18. Qxc8+ Nc6 {}
