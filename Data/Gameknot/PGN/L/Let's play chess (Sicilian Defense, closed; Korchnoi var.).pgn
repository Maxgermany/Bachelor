1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 e6 {I prefer to "close" the Sicilian myself when playing against it, but as I rarely play the Sicilian myself I'm unsure of continuations.  The straight-forward 2. ... Nc6 I dislike by virtue of mirrored knights; 2. ... d6 is just ugly aesthetically in my opinion.  2. ... Nf6 3. e5 looked unappealing.} 3. Bc4 {An odd choice given that the bishop's attack has just been cut off.} Nc6 {There's the possibility from here of Black driving an attack down the Queen's column.} 4. Nf3 g6 5. d3 {Cuts off the bishop: the full 5. d5 may be a bit too adventurous but it does force the exchange to White's at least temporary advantage if the fiancetto is delayed on 5. cxd5 6. Nxd5 Nxd5 7. Qxd5 Nf3.  Problem would be on 6. ... Bg2, but 7. Be3 seems satisfactory as does 7. Nxc3.} Bg7 6. Nb5 d5 {The assault commences quickly.} 7. exd5 {White rushes in at the promise of an open King's column and the attack.} exd5 8. Qe2+ {A poor move.  Most likely White anticipates 8. ... Qe7 9. Nc7! but that trap's a bit obvious.  The alternative 9. Qxe7 Nxe7 10. Bb5? is okay but ugly: starting with a threatened bishop makes the whole position awkward.  8. Bb3 was sounder, and the QP will discourage pursuit even by pawns.} Be6 {White is clearly thinking 9. Bxd5 wins the QP since 9. ... Qxd5? 10. Nc7! wins Black's queen, right? - and moving the king has the same problem, although to a lesser degree since Black gets the two minor pieces for a Rook and a pawn.  Not 8. Qe7, as discussed.  8. ... Ne7 looks most conventional.  From Black's point of view, this is best because it clear the Queen-side for action, even though the bishop is pinned.} 9. Bxd5 {White springs his trap - but is in for a surprise.} Qa5+ {Surprise!  Let's look at the possibilities.  10. Bd2, 10. Qd2, and 10. c3 all lose the knight outright.  10. b4 adds a pawn and possibly a Rook to Black's haul.  10. Nc3 Bxc3 can only end badly.  My gut feel is that 10. Qd2 Qxb5 may leave White the best position.} 10. b4 {White chooses the poorest approach to blocking the Queen, but is determined to save his pin.} Qxb4+ 11. Bd2 Qxb5 12. O-O {White, for all he lost a piece, does still have development, the attack, a pin, and the ability to force the column open on his side - but he forgot about the Rook.} Bxa1 13. Bxe6 {The final fireworks commence, White down a rook and a minor piece.} fxe6 14. Qxe6+ Nge7 {Why not Nce7?  Um.  Good question.  it would free the Queen to defend, too.} 15. Rxa1 Nd8 16. Qf6 Rf8 17. Qg7 h5 18. Re1 Ndc6 19. Qxg6+ Kd7 20. Qe6+ Kc7 21. Bh6 Rfe8 22. Bf4+ Kb6 23. Be3 Ng8 24. Qg6 Qb2 25. Nd2 Qc3 26. Nc4+ Ka6 27. Bd2 Rxe1+ 28. Bxe1 Qxe1# {The final combination simply appeared: but White was too busy trying to maintain an attack with insufficient material and could not watch his position.  It would have happened eventually; any attempt to regroup would return the attack and the tempo to Black.  Game.}
