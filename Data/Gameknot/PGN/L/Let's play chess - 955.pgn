[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B10)"]

1. e4 {This was a standard game between two low-ranked players. I annotated this game simply to try and improve my own skills and understanding of the game. I opened with e4 - the only move I've had much experience with.} c6 {Black plays the Caro-Kann defence.} 2. Nc3 b5 {The Goldman variation of the Caro-Kann plays d5 instead. I can't find this variation in the GameKnot database.} 3. Nf3 e6 {Again, a less-than-common move, with a strong structure on white squares but very weak on black squares, a blocked white bishop and with no pieces developed.} 4. d4 {I tried to push paws forward to stop black gaining too much pawn strength.} Nf6 5. Bd3 Ng4 {A strange move for the knight, with no support and no visible motive. Black is falling further and further behind on development.} 6. Bf4 {With hindsight, Bg5 might have also been good. Black would have three options: move the queen, play f6 in contrast to his previous pawn moves, or play Be7, the best option. Instead, I played the less-confrontational Bf4.} Qf6 7. Ne2 {This move served two purposes for me: I was able to defend the bishop and move the knight away from black's oppressive pawns.} Bb4+ {A waste of a move on black's part.} 8. Bd2 {c3 is also viable, with a view to pushing forward on the queen-side.} Bd6 9. e5 {Pushes forward and forks the black queen and bishop.} Bxe5 {A badly considered move that loses the bishop and leaves a white pawn in a strong position. Allowing exd6 would probably have been better, as the pawn would have been left hanging and vulnerable.} 10. dxe5 Qe7 11. c4 {Pushes forward to try and break black's pawn structure and free the queen for action.} Na6 12. cxb5 {In keeping with the idea behind playing c4. The next few moves require little comment.} Nc5 13. Qc2 Rb8 14. Be3 Nxd3+ 15. Qxd3 Rxb5 16. Qc3 Ba6 17. O-O Qb4 18. Bxa7 {For the next few moves, both sides start playing to capture lots of opposing pieces. However, I came out marginally ahead.} Qxb2 19. Qd4 Qxe2 20. Qxg4 Rxe5 21. Nxe5 Qxe5 {I had fewer and weaker pawns than black but was a rook up after the last exchange.} 22. Rab1 {The threat is 23 Rb8  Ke7 24 Rxh8} Ke7 23. Rfe1 Qf5 24. Qb4+ c5 {A bad move. Throws away a passed pawn for nothing.} 25. Bxc5+ Kf6 26. Qd4+ Kg5 27. Re5 {Skewers the black queen. At this point, I took a decisive lead. Again, the remaining moves are all fairly obvious.} Bd3 28. Rxf5+ exf5 29. Qxg7+ Kf4 30. Qxh8 Bxb1 31. Qd4+ Be4 32. Qxd7 {At this point, black gave up, and Iwon by timeout. I clearly had a far superior position to black. It is hard to see how black could have won this game. Thank you for reading this. Comments are welcome.}
