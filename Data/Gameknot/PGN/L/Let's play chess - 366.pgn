1. Nf3 {Greetings! This is my first annotated game, simply because my adversary had a high rating, so beating him became my record. Actually, as I noticed, he's not a genuine 1700 rating range type of player, because he got it by winning over others players having the 1200-1600 rating range. Anyway...He started the development with the king side knight.} Nf6 {When we started the game, I was at the end of the "learn how to open" phase. Back then, I responded with the same king side knight. I no longer do that... :)} 2. b3 {Yada, yada, yada, the typical opening, continued by Bb2, Nc3 and a short castle.} g6 {Same here.} 3. Bb2 Bg7 4. c4 O-O {His majesty goes to a safe place.} 5. g3 {Okay, so he intends to dominate both long diagonals...} Nc6 {Back in the days I used to go Nc6 before c5. Nowadays I do it the other way around.} 6. Bg2 d6 {I open up my white bishop.} 7. d3 {A strange move...or maybe I'm just not illuminated enough. :)} e5 {Taking control of the center.} 8. Nbd2 {Okay, now I get it...he's coming for my king.} Ne7 {So, in response, I attack it as well...:))} 9. e4 {Nice move, it passed my attention, I'm pretty much blocked there with the traveling knight...I can't and won't go back to c6...I would look like a fool...} c5 {Blocking.} 10. O-O {Finally, he puts his suveranity into safety.} a5 {Attacking...the wrong side, but still attacking...} 11. h3 {???} Nc6 {Eventually, I get where I want with both the c pawn and the queen side knight.} 12. a3 {Okay, so now he controls the entire 4th rank...so what? :)} Qb6 {Placing your queen on the enemy king's diagonal, especially in a "waiting, to errupt" type of attack, is always good.} 13. Rb1 {He thought I wanted to achieve something on that file.} Be6 {I'm just developing my pieces...that's all.} 14. Re1 {He's preparing for war with the heavy pieces.} Rab8 {Mee too.} 15. Nf1 {The only possible square for his queen side knight.} Rfe8 {Face to face, cowboy! Heads up!} 16. Ne3 {And here we go!} Nd4 {Back at you!} 17. Nxd4 {He accepts the exchange...} exd4 18. Nd5 {Theoretically not a bad move...} Bxd5 19. cxd5 {The exchange takes place, we both have doubled peasants.} Qa7 {I open up some space for the b pawn.} 20. f4 {Pressurising my king side, heh?} Nh5 {Hoping to get that g3 pawn...not the best of moves by the way.} 21. Qf3 {It's not gonna' happen', not today...} b5 {He's out as well.} 22. g4 {WTF?!? I didn't see this coming.} c4 {Realising that moving the knight back to f6 will make only worse, because of g5 or e5, I give him something to think about on the other side.} 23. bxc4 {He calls my bluff, instead of taking my knight.} bxc4 24. dxc4 {Not the best move, I'd say, when his king is on my queen's diagonal. } d3+ {Bang! He overlooked this one...} 25. Kh1 {Okay, that will do.} Bxb2 {Bang-bang!} 26. gxh5 {It's too late, mate, especially when my black bishop is in the nearby of a possibly promoting pawn.} d2 {Bang!} 27. Red1 Qd4 {With a single move, defending two pieces...God, I love and hate queens...:))} 28. hxg6 {Trying to fork my king and rook.} fxg6 {No way, dude!} 29. Qe2 {The only sane solution to the situation.} Bxa3 {Only because it evened out the material standings.} 30. Rxb8 Rxb8 31. Rxd2 {Okay. In this move there's the key to the game. I was kind of afraid that he will take it with the queen, which would have been the good move. Now I can check his majesty.} Rb1+ {He can defend with three pieces or run.} 32. Kh2 {He runs. Bad for me...:)} Qg1+ {Run Forrest, ruuuun!!!} 33. Kg3 Bb4 {Not achieving any progress in checkmating him, I start an attack with a good positioned bishop.} 34. Rc2 {Didn't understand why did he chosed that specific square...} Re1 {Run queen, ruuuun!} 35. Qf2 {Nice, opened up the e3 square for another check.} Re3+ 36. Kg4 Qd1+ {And so on...I was hoping he would put some pieces between, but he preferred running.} 37. Kg5 Qh5+ {My king at f7 would have been nice...} 38. Kf6 Bc3+ {I'm sorry mate, but I want to checkmate you.} 39. Rxc3 {Didn't think he'll sacrifice it, but he had an ingenious plan all along, as you'll see...} Rxc3 {The fool me exploits the situation, without anticipating his next move.} 40. Qb2 {Bang!!! WTF?!? Imminent checmate against my king or losing the rook? I didn't see this coming...} Qh4+ {I was lucky, I managed to think a way out of the situation.} 41. Ke6 Rxc4 {For material advantage, clearing the c file and perhaps because of promotion danger.} 42. Qb8+ Kg7 {The only possible square to run to.} 43. Qb7+ {Draw by threefold repetition, mister?} Kh6 {No way, today I'm winning!!!} 44. f5 {The second big wrong move from my opponent, not seeing that if we both accept the exchanges, the e file will free up.} gxf5 45. exf5 {From this move on, I'm going after his queen.} Qe1+ 46. Kf6 {Blunder, blunder, blunder...} Qe5+ {Only square to go is f7.} 47. Kf7 Qg7+ { He resignes, because of my skewer upon the king against his queen.}
