1. e4 {He opens Kings Pawn} e5 {I decide to match} 2. Qh5 Nc6 {After he prematurely developed his Queen, I take a standard Indian Defense} 3. Nf3 g6 4. Qg5 f6 5. Qg3 b6 6. c3 Bh6 7. b3 d6 8. Kd1 Bf4 9. Qh4 h5 {This was the move where I felt I had gained the upper hand.  His queen is now sufficiently trapped for the time being.  Since he spent no time developing other pieces, now I just have to lean a bit.} 10. g3 g5 11. Nxg5 Bg4+ 12. Nf3 Bxf3+ 13. Ke1 Bg5 {I opt to trap his Queen in a single space and plan to take  5 next turn} 14. Qh3 Bxh1 15. Bb5 Bxe4 16. Qe6+ Nge7 17. Qc4 d5 18. Qe2 a6 19. Bxc6+ Nxc6 20. f3 Bxb1 {Since his rook is completely cornered and his bishop bad at the worst, undeveloped at best, it was a trade I felt essential to prevent any defense from mounting.} 21. Rxb1 d4 22. f4 d3 23. Qe4 Ne7 {At this point, my g5 bishop has served its initial purpose and I'm willing to lose it to gain some file leverage} 24. fxg5 fxg5 25. Qxe5 Rg8 26. Ba3 {I saw this coming and was easily stopped} c5 27. b4 Qd7 {At this point I'm planning a Qh3, Rf8, Qf1 attack} 28. Qe4 {This move foils that} Rf8 {I decide that taking the open f file is more important than the a file rook at this point, and plan on defending my king with my knight, which will secure a win} 29. Qxa8+ {This is where mate is gaurunteed} Nc8 30. bxc5 Qe7+ 31. Kd1 Rf1# {}
