[Opening "Old Benoni (A43), Franco-Benoni defence"]

1. d4 {the queens pawn opening send the pawn out defended by queen but only opens line for 1 development piece so is inferior to e4 is a better choice} c5 {I challenge the weak pawn immediately.} 2. d5 {White has to waste a move dodging my attack, so I already have an advantage.} e6 {I attack the weakened pawn again} 3. Nc3 {White defends} Nf6 {and I get a knight into play to challenge White's} 4. e4 {and White has a strong looking center???} d6 {there has to be a catch, I have a lead in development that will triumph over White's center} 5. Bd3 {that bishop is biting on granite} Be7 {and my bishop is better because has the d4-square} 6. Nf3 {trying to catch up} exd5 {but I get the attack strike first} 7. Bb5+ {moves the same piece twice in the opening is not good choice} Bd7 {I get rid of bad bishop} 8. e5 {but White tries desperately to recover from deficit} dxe5 {I have three pawns in the center in a mightily delightful style.} 9. Nxe5 {but the knight took one but I still win} Bxb5 {with tactics} 10. Nxb5 {White thinks he has recovered, but does not realize that my d-pawn is strong} O-O {Castles} 11. Ng4 {White goes for the trade} Nc6 {develops} 12. O-O {castles} a6 {force retreat} 13. Nc3 {so now I have extra pawn center going on to win} d4 {and advancing to win} 14. Ne2 {the knight blocks the other knight defense} Nxg4 {and I take that knight} 15. h3 {so now White lose} Nge5 {now White lose} 16. Bf4 {so now White lose} Bg5 {I trade off the bishop that is the same color as my pawn chain} 17. Bxe5 {and White gains tactic} Nxe5 {after I take} 18. f4 {White wins piece but it is OK I get strong square e3 for the knight which is better than a rook} Nc4 {good move} 19. fxg5 {White thinks recovered} Ne3 {good move} 20. Qd3 {White realizes has not recovered} Qxg5 {I think the knight is better than the rook so I do not take} 21. Rf2 {White chances} Rfd8 {And I move to play c4} 22. c4 {white plays c4} dxc3 e.p. {so I reveal the d1-square} 23. Qxc3 {White captures} Rd1+ {and if you are ahead by rook for knight, you should try to make trade rook for rook so that your two rooks are not redundant} 24. Rxd1 {and forced} Nxd1 {and forks} 25. Qf3 {and moves} Nxf2 {and wins} 26. Qxf2 {and takes} Qd2 {and dominates controls everything with 1 rook vs 0 rooks I win easy but with 2 rooks vs 1 rook it is unusually confusing} 27. Qf3 Qxb2 28. Qd5 Qxe2 29. Qxb7 Re8 30. Qc6 c4 31. Qxa6 c3 32. Qxe2 Rxe2 33. Kf1 Rxa2 34. Ke1 Rxg2 35. h4 c2 36. h5 c1=R# {}
