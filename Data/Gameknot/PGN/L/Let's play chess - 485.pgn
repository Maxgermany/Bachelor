1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Playing the Italian game as opposed to the more standard Ruy Lopez.} a6 {An interesting, though very passive reply.} 4. O-O h6 {Black really needs to start developing pieces as opposed to solidifying his pawn structure} 5. c3 {Preparing d4.} Nf6 6. Qb3 {e4is immune due to more serious threats on f7.} Qe7 {Sadly, the only decent move, even though it blocks in the dark-squared bishop, leaving black's king in the center.} 7. Re1 {Protecting the e-pawn.} d6 8. d3 Be6 {A good move, releasing some of the pressure from f7.} 9. Bxe6 b5 {?? 9.Qxe6 or fxe6 regain all the lost material.} 10. Bd5 Na5 {Exposing the rook, though attacking white's queen.} 11. Qa3 Nxd5 12. Qxa5 Nb6 {At this point in the game, white has an advantage in material and his pieces are slightly more active than black's.} 13. Be3 {Threatening to win the c7 pawn.} Nc8 {Removing the threat.} 14. Nbd2 Qd7 15. d4 {Finally, going for the center.} Be7 {Black will castle while he still can.} 16. Rad1 {Setting up the rook opposite to the enemy queen.} O-O 17. dxe5 f5 {Re-capturing would allow a nasty discovered attack.} 18. exd6 {Winning material and opening up the game to expose black's weak king position.} Bxd6 19. e5 Be7 20. Nb3 {Repositioning with initiative.} Qc6 {Better would have been 20.Qe8, as the move that was played loses even more tempo.} 21. Nbd4 {Repositioning with initiative.} Qc4 22. Nd2 Qa4 23. Qxa4 bxa4 {The upcoming endgame does not favor black in any possible way; he is down in material, his pieces are poorly co-ordinated, and his queenside pawn structure is a complete mess.} 24. Nc6 {Removing the threat of 24.f4, trapping white's bishop.} f4 25. Nxe7+ {Capturing with check.} Nxe7 26. Bc5 {Forcing further simplification, which in the position, can only benefit white.} Rfe8 27. Bxe7 Rxe7 28. Nf3 Rb8 29. Re2 Kh7 30. Rd4 {Getting ready to attack blacks weak pawns and create more passed pawns of my own.} a3 31. b3 {The pawn at a3 will be a permanent weakness. Taking it with 31.bxa3 allows black counterplay down the b-file, and exposes white's weak back rank.} g5 32. Ra4 Rd7 33. h3 {Securing the back rank.} Rd1+ 34. Kh2 Rb6 35. Rxa3 c5 36. e6 {Pushing the passed pawn further up the board.} Rd8 37. Ra5 Rb5 38. Rxa6 {Creating a passed rook-pawn, which are usually hard to stop.} Re8 39. Ra7+ Kg8 40. Re5 Rbb8 41. Rxc5 Rxe6 {Although I have given up my passed e-pawn, white's queenside pawns are unstoppable.} 42. Re5 {Exchanging down.} Rxe5 43. Nxe5 Re8 44. Ng4 Re6 45. f3 Kf8 46. c4 Ke8 47. c5 Kd8 48. b4 Kc8 49. Ra3 h5 50. Nf2 Kc7 51. Ne4 g4 52. hxg4 hxg4 53. Rb3 Rh6+ 54. Kg1 gxf3 55. gxf3 Rg6+ 56. Kf2 Rh6 57. a4 Rh2+ 58. Kg1 Ra2 59. b5 Rxa4 60. b6+ {Black resigned as there is no way the stop the pawns other than sacrificing more material.}
