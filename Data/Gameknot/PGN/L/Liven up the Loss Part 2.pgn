1. c4 {Hi everyone!  Well, I am glad you have enjoyed Part 1, now here comes Part 2, I am playing against the same opponent and this game has some parallels to the last.  I thought I would play David at his own game.  The English Opening by starting with 1.c4.} e5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 {3. Bg2 - pretty standard fianchetto.} Nc6 4. Nc3 Bb4 {4. .......Bb4 creating a potential pin on my c3 knight.} 5. Nd5 O-O 6. Nxb4 Nxb4 {6. .... Nxb4 - after getting rid of a potential pin on my c3 knight by exchanging it for his bishop, it seems it is gonna allow one pesky knight into my position.  I kick the knight back though on the next turn.} 7. a3 Nc6 8. e4 {8. e4 - finally I get this move in.} d6 9. Ne2 a5 10. O-O Be6 {10. ...... Be6 - hitting at my c4 pawn but at least I can defend it easily with b3 or d3.  Over the next two moves I end up doing both.} 11. b3 a4 12. d3 {12. d3 - at the moment my pawn structure seems fairly solid, but later on, just like Captain Smith of the Titanic thought, it turned out not to be the case a few moves down the line (I recently watched Cameron's 1997 movie of the Titanic recently and thought it would have some parallels here!).} b5 13. Be3 Na5 {13. ..... Na5 - out of nowhere David puts a lot of stress on my pawn structure.  I have a feeling that this structure is gonna be like the Titanic was just before it finally disappeared more than 12,000 feet below the sea............ } 14. bxa4 bxc4 15. dxc4 Nxc4 {15.  ....... Nxc4 - ...... breaking apart under the strain!} 16. Nc3 Nxe3 17. fxe3 {17. fxe3 - and now David creates more pawn islands - these are starting to look like the ice floes in the ocean that sank the Titanic!  Mayday Glenda, Mayday!} Nd7 18. Qc2 {18. Qc2 -  Glenda responds to the distress rockets and desperate morse code messages sent out by these stricken footmen by desperately trying to keep them connected.} Qg5 19. Rfe1 Nc5 {19. ...... Nc5 - uh-oh, the BQ and one remaining pesky knight is infiltrating my position, passivitis is setting in and I am really in deep water here!} 20. Nd5 {20. Nd5 - but now, I try to fight back.  My knight homes in on Dave's backward c7 pawn.} Rfc8 21. Rab1 Rxa4 22. Rb5 {22. Rb5 - setting a trap.  If 22. .....c6? then I will play Rxc5, dxc5 and then Qxa4!} Rxa3 23. Rxc5 {23. Rxc5 - but I take anyway!  I bet you are all now thinking, what the?????  Fancy voluntarily giving up the exchange to an IM when already down on material!  But there is some method in the madness.  I do get one of my pawns back as well as the knight and the c7 pawn is very vulnerable indeed and at the moment I am tying his rook down to the defense of it.  Also, Glenda now has the opportunity to yet again make her presence felt.} dxc5 24. Qxc5 Rca8 25. Ne7+ {25. Ne7+ - I was tempted to take off the c7 pawn at once but I had also designs on the e5 pawn and I thought I would get the knight round to the kingside to create a block as you will see.} Kh8 26. Nf5 Qf6 27. Qxc7 {27. Qxc7 - But the BQ has found another way to defend the e5 pawn so Glenda now takes off the c pawn.  Now I am just two points down on material and more importantly all the pawns on the queenside have been liquidated.} Ra3a1 28. Qc3 Ra1a2 29. Rf1 Rc8 30. Qb4 {30. Qb4 - staying active.} Qd8 31. Bf3 Qd3 32. Rd1 Qc2 33. Qe1 {33. Qe1 - no alternative.} Qxh2+ 34. Kf1 Bc4+ {34. ..... Bc4+ - and now I wave the white flag as the only way to block the check is with the Q and B.  Both lead to heavy material loss.  Again, well played David.}
