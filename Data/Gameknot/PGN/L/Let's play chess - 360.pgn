1. e4 c5 {sicilian.} 2. d4 {white attacks for center.} cxd4 {accepts.} 3. Qxd4 Nc6 {hitting queen} 4. Qd1 {not so good, better i think was Qa4 which would have been very hard to hit.} d6 5. Nc3 Nf6 {all normalish stuff i guess.} 6. h3 {that was unnecessary because if bg4 then black can just play f3.} g6 7. Be2 Bg7 {ready to castle.} 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O {both kings now safe} a6 {defencive, but this time necessary.} 10. Nh2 {white builds up an attack.} Bd7 11. f4 {white has to play aggressive to win.} Rc8 12. Bd3 Qb6+ {check.} 13. Kh1 Ne8 {a good move otherwise the knight was completely useless} 14. f5 {the attack begins!} gxf5 {it was probably better not to take but wait for FxG6 then recapture with HxG6.} 15. exf5 e6 {blacks king is now too open.} 16. Qh5 h6 {.} 17. Bxh6 {!!!!!!} Qxb2 {too unfocussed on the kingside.} 18. Bxg7 Nxg7 19. Qg5 {.} Qxc3 20. f6 {game over no way to stop mate.} Nb4 21. Qxg7# {CHECKMATE good game by both players.}
