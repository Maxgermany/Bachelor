[Opening "Two knights defence (Modern bishop's opening) (C55)"]

1. e4 {Here's a game where White experiments with a double opening sacrifice and... it works!  Interesting variation for anyone who likes to get their light-squared bishop on c4 early in the game.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {Everything normal so far.  White now goes for the super-agressive, and totally unknown, to me, "haywire attack" (if it's not called this, it should be).} 4. d3 {Yes - just had to solid-up that pawn there first...} Bc5 {This is book} 5. Bxf7+ {Boom . here we go... Black's king takes...} Kxf7 6. Nxe5+ {Gosh - he's trashed another piece.  This can't be going to end well..} Nxe5 {But... reminiscent of that kp opening for Black, we fork the two front pieces... oh yes, and that kp's hanging as well - what's going to happen?} 7. d4 Nxe4 {he takes, now I have the option - and go for the Bish, of course, mainly based on the horrible-looking continuation of B or N taking my f-pawn if I go for the knight (though it would give me check with the queen on f3 next go - leave that one for someone else to look into..)} 8. dxc5 {not destined for a very long life of course, this c-pawn...} Nxc5 {But now -} 9. Qd5+ Ne6 {and } 10. Qxe5 {Gaining (regaining?) equality.  Let's take stock: White has an active Queen, nice dark-squared bishop lines and imminent castling possibilities against a displaced Black King and flat Black pawns.  So, I need to develop all my other pieces but not looking too bad on balance at this point...} Re8 {Yes - let's get Kingy into safety} 11. O-O d6 12. Qf5+ Kg8 {Black has nicely developed his k-side Rook and is in danger of attacking White's Queen, so now it's up to Wite to prove he's not just a Queen-slinging loonie.  Here goes - } 13. Nc3 Nd4 14. Qd5+ {Useful check which retards Black's d4 Knight possibilities - } Ne6 {not 14...Be6 15. QxN} 15. Be3 {Key move.  White's only chance at going for it now is to attack Black's undeveloped position and, especially, the unprotected King.  The bishop will be wanting to reposition to d4.} Kh8 16. Rad1 a6 17. f4 Nf8 {All Black's pieces are on the back rank.  The idea is to ttack White's e3 Bishop and provide some piece defence for the King but in the end helps White's Bd4 intent.} 18. Ne4 Nd7 19. Bd4 {There we go.  things looking good for White now.} c6 {Queen has to move, but the tactical strength of d4 will become apparent shortly.} 20. Qf7 {One of those scary moves where you don't know if it's just too daring and something horrible's about to happen.  The great thing here is that against almost all defences (...Q or Re7, or ...Rf8), Bxg7 is checkmate!} Rg8 {The saving move but we've all seen those Knight checkmates in the chess puzzles that look very like this...} 21. Qh5 {I think Nf8 is needed here to keep the defence going} d5 22. Ng5 {There was a phantom threat a couple of moves ago of Wite's N taking the p on d6 and forking the Q on f7.  I was much more interested in getting to this position, which is now won for White (as far as I can see) but of course the threat of N f6 is still there in case something unexpected happens} h6 {You don't need to be told that Qxh6 is mate, of course.  It's nice when things work out.}
