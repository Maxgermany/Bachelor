[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 {IN this game, I attack white's bishop, while at the same time threatening his b2 square. The b2 threat was the more dangerous one since taking the bishop would allow him to fork my king and knight to win the piece back. So he moves the bishop and suffers the consequences. Annotation Updated Wednesday, July 21, 2010.} d6 {I personally like the Pirc, Kings Indian and Benoni defenses. This game I'm playing the Pirc.} 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Nh3 {White made a knight move to the side of the board, (this is usually a bad move, though there are exceptions). He most likely had the intention of playing Ng5 to attack my f-pawn. Of course the 2nd Knight move, if allowed, would get the piece back in the game. I normally don't like to give my bishop for a knight. This is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped, closed positions, while bishops are stronger in open positions. You have to consider each game individually, but generally, pieces get traded off and closed positions in the opening, become open positions in the middle game and end game. So, although both pieces are technically the same value, the bishops are my piece of choice. Yet in this case the advantage gained far outweighs the loss of a bishop. He must capture toward the outside of the board, deserting crucial central squares. In addition he will have double pawns on the h-file, which will be easy prey in the endgame. Thus my next move, 4. ... Bxh3.  On the other hand, he gets an open g-file. So to prevent any attacks on my king, I planned to castle queen side.  (The advantages mentioned I never capitalized on because after he castled on the queen side, I was able to chase his king back into the middle of the board where I would have mated had he not resigned.)} Bxh3 5. gxh3 Bg7 6. d4 c6 7. d5 Qc7 8. Bf4 cxd5 {Giving a discovered attack on his bishop, so he has to take the pawn with his bishop or play the better move, 9. Bb5+.} 9. Bb5+ {Good for him.} Nbd7 10. exd5 O-O-O {See note on white's move 4.} 11. Qe2 Nb6 {I do prefer my bishops, (no really, I do). But in this case white's light square bishop is very restricted. So I did not want him to play Bxd7, eliminating his bad bishop. I plan after this knight move to play a6, chasing the bishop. I am not concerned about 12. ... a6 13. Bxa6 ... bxa6 14. Qxa6 + (busting open my kings defenses), because he did not have enough fire power to followup on the sac. With a queen and knight already in the area, I felt sure I could get my pieces over to defend in sufficient time.} 12. O-O-O a6 {See note on black's previous move.} 13. Bxa6 {He's going for it, just as I planned! He'll have 2 pawns for a bishop, and no real attack. In addition, with the 2 double pawns on the h-file, his pawns are nullified, so I see myself with a full bishop lead after 13. Bxa6 bxa6 14. Qxa6+ Qb7.} bxa6 14. Qxa6+ Qb7 15. Qe2 {Being down in material now, it would not be good for him to trade.} Nfxd5 {The pawn is insufficiently defended, but I also wanted to open the bishop diagonal and queen b-file to hit b2.} 16. Nxd5 Nxd5 17. Bg5 {He did not need to move the Bishop. If 17. ... NxB then 18. Qc5+ and 19. QxB (still on f4). What he needed was to defend b2 instead (17. Qc4+... followed by 18. Qb3. After the queen trade, he'd have double pawns, but my attack would be lessened for now, or he could play 17. c3 ).} Bxb2+ {Now: 18. Kb1 Nc3# or 18. Kd2 Qb4+ 19. Kd3 Qd4# or 19. c3 Qxc3#} 18. Kd2 Qb4+ {And White resigns as 19. Kd3 Qd4# or 19. c3 QxP#.}
