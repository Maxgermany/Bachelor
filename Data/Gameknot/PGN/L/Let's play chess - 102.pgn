[Opening "Vienna game, Max Lange defence (C25)"]

1. e4 {I told Erika that this is the most common opening, and she remembers that very well.} e5 {She does mention the same.  I can see why since the same pawn is being opening, but 1.e4 is the King's Pawn Opening, and this is known as, the King's Pawn Game.} 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 {I believe that this is called the Four Knights Defense which is also common.  When I kept trying different openings and defenses, on one or two occasions, I played the same defense.  } 4. Bd3 {?! This was played to continue with developing since Erika also remembers that, in general, you want to develop your pieces in the opening.  As that's what I taught her, but this is not the best move for the same reason why after 1.d4 d5, you don't want to play Nc3 or ...Nc6 before advancing the c pawn.  As the d pawn is always a center pawn which is critical.  So, this move blocks the pawn.  Better would've been to develop elsewhere, so 4.Be2, 4.Bc4, or 4.Bb5.  I would've played 4.Bb5 as that a transposes into the Berlin Defense since the Berlin is 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6, and yes, sometimes white then answers with 4.Nc3.  This is important for you to know Erika, because it transposes means that it's a transposition.  Now, transposition occurs when the same moves are played but in a different order.  For example, what I just mentioned, compared to, what you played are the same moves but in a different move order.   } a6 {This was played to prevent 5.Nb5 or 5.Bb5.  But, that would not have been a problem here.  Instead, better for black would've been to develop her Bf8 so that she could castle on the next move.} 5. b3 {Since the center pawn is blocked, white fianchettos as this allows Erika to develop her Bc1.  It's an important for you to note that a fianchetto is a flank to develop your Bishop on the longest diagonal, Erika.  So, advancing the b or g pawns is, by definition, a fianchetto even if it is not completed. I, however, would've castled here since you generally want to castle early in the game, but that's a matter of preference there.} Qe7 {?! I am not sure why black played this.  The Queen is out prior to having two pieces developed.  What's more is that black's Queen is blocking the center, and thereby, the same diagonal as her Bf8.  Better would've been to develop her DSB for the same reason that I mentioned earlier.} 6. Nd5 {Since 6.Nb5?? is unplayable, Erika threatens a Knight fork by attacking the Queen.} Qd6 {Black is threatening to win a pawn as this brings about two attackers against one defender.  So, This is ok, but slightly better would've been 6...Qd8 where black Bf8 would have a little more mobility.} 7. Nxc7+ {?? I can understand why Erika played.  It is certainly a fork between the Rook and King since white I was giving examples of a fork upon being asked.  From Erika's point of view since this is what I thought while learning the game, it looks very good.  But, this, however, is ineffective because that area was protected by the Queen.  By playing this, white just left her Knight en-prise, so it's the first blunder.  But, this is a bad one because black is going to win a piece for a pawn.  This early in the game (before the first 10 moves, as deeper_insight explains) that much of a difference is enough to win, in it of itself.  This shows why it's also not a good idea to place the opponent in check just because the opportunity is there as cplusplus11 in a different annotation.  Best was 7.Nc3 or 7.Ne3 and everything is still even.  Between those two moves, it would've been very difficult, but I probably would've played 7.Ne3 to keep the Knight centralized.} Qxc7 8. O-O {Erika now decides to get her King to safety.  It still works.} Be7 {And, black is prepared to do the same thing.} 9. Ba3 {?? Erika played this to complete her development at once, but this is a blunder that ought to win more material.  Can you figure out why, Erika?} O-O {And, the reason was 9...Bxa3  I'm not surprised that black decided to castle, but getting another free piece is worth more.  With this move, Erika can and will exchange first.   It's better then losing more material without compensation, but Erika had a slightly better move, as I'll explain below.} 10. Bxe7 {?! As you would've been better off retreating with 10.Bb2, Erika.  The idea being is that, in general, you don't want to exchange when behind or liquidate.  As that favors the one that's ahead since you have less to defend with in the very end.} Nxe7 11. c4 {Erika does something that she mentioned in previous, though it is what I taught.  She call's it a pawn wall, but it's called a pawn chain since the pawns are connected right next to each other.  I learned about this from deeper_insight and how effective they can be.  GM Susan Polgar said something about that in a lecture about the French Defense which I saw with TA when he forced a draw with his Queen against both of his opponents Rooks in the longest game that I have annotated.} a5 {Trying to mobilize her Rook which is not a bad way to go about.  But, I would've advanced the d pawn or fianchettoed by advancing the b pawn with the idea of completing of development on the next move.} 12. a4 {Meanwhile, Erika stops the a pawn from advancing any further which is something that I also would've done.} Ra6 {Getting her Rook active.} 13. Ng5 {I'm not sure why Erika played this.  In my opinion, her idea might have been 13.Qf3 to put pressure on the f file since 14.Qg4?? or 14...Qh5?? are unplayable for the obvious reason.} h6 {But, this gives black a tempo since the N is attacked.} 14. Nf3 Re8 {And, she uses that time to centralize her Rook.} 15. Rb1 {Adding another defender to her b3 pawn.  I see why as 15...Qb6 or 15...Rb6, but I would've waited until black this.  Instead, I would've played 15.Re1 to centralize the Rook.} b6 {But, this gives black a nice looking pawn chain.  However, black has fianchettoed her Bd8, so this was played in order to allow black, at some point, to complete her development.} 16. Rc1 {I'm not sure why Erika played, but it's difficult to suggest a good move.  As noted, however, I would've played 16.Re1.} Ng6 {It looks like black is preparing to do some damage.  As 17...Nf4 would threaten white's Bd3.  However, if white were then to defend with 18.Bc2, I'm not exactly what would follow.  As black, I'd continue with something like 18...Ng4 in an attempt to put some pressure against the King, as then I'd looking for ways and planning a variation or to do something with the e5 pawn like exchange it and then come up with the Queen against the King side..} 17. Nxe5 {?? But, this loses another piece for pawn and leaves another piece attacked which might not seem important now but will become critical very soon.  White thought that this pawn was hanging, and thereby able, to be captured.  But, you overlooked that it was defended by her Ng6, Erika.  Therefore, just about anything was better then this move.} Nxe5 18. c5 {?? Threatening the Rook and the b pawn.  That is, given that 18...cxb6?? allows white to win the Queen with 19.Qxc7.  I think it was Hope Chess as it looks like white was hoping that black would overlook this.  But, this is where Hope Chess does not work, Erika, as in most cases.  This only happens when one is lost and has no good moves yet.  So, the only way is to hope that the opponent messes up and allows the draw.  When, however, there's still fight left, that's generally not the way to go.  Instead, you should assume that your opponent will find the best move, as Grandmaster Susan Polgar emphasized.  As noted, not only did 17.Nxe5 win a piece for a pawn, but it left another piece hanging.  And, I was talking about the one on d3.  So, this move allows black to just take.  Best would've been to retreat with 18.Be2. } Nxd3 19. Rb1 {? Although this protects the Rook, better would've been 19.Rc2, 19.Rc3, or 19.Rc4.  The idea being is that the Rook would've been better off on the same file, as this move allows black to win, yet, another pawn.  } bxc5 20. e5 {Doing what she can for counterplay, Erika attacks the Knight.  Not surprisingly, black defends.} Nd5 21. e6 {I'm not why Erika played this, but it's irrelevant.  No matter what white did, black was going to win another pawn.  Even after, for example, 21.Qe2 Nxe5 22.Qxe5?? is, obviously, unplayable.} fxe6 22. Qf3 {Doing what else there's left for a fighting chance, Erika attacks the Knight.  This time, however, it works because black is about to make a blunder.} Rf8 {?? As black played this to gain tempo.  Usually it works when the Queen is attacked but not this time.  As this allows Erika to win back a piece.  Best was 22...Ne5 which also attacks the Queen with the same piece that was attacked.  How I put this is counterattack, and I saw examples of this in some of charleshiggies annotated games. } 23. Qxd3 Nb4 {At the same time, the Rook was attacked.  Similar to what I noted before, black defends by counterattacking.} 24. Qb5 {I'm not exactly sure why Erika played this, but I believe that she did this to put pressure on the Rook so that if blacks Nb4 were to move, white would be ready for action.} Rb6 {But, black responds, first.} 25. Qe2 Rf6 {Getting her Rook ready.  But, I would've played 25...Rf5 to threaten mate with 26...Rh5, and I'd have a ready answer if white were to meet with this threat.} 26. d3 {I don't know why white played, but I can't think of anything better, this time around.} Rf5 {I'm not exactly sure why black moved the Rook again.  I only would've understood, if she were to follow up with 26...Rh5 for the reason noted earlier.} 27. d4 {? But, this is a mistake that ought to lose an additional pawn.  How should black proceed, Erika.} h5 {I'm not exactly why black played this.  But, I believe that she was trying to get a passed pawn.  However, the solution was 27...cxd4, Erika.  Not only would this have won a pawn, but black would've had a passed pawn.  It's important to know because a passed pawn is a pawn that's free to advance as it has nothing in front or to the side of that pawn to stop it's advancements.  That's known to be very dangerous and often leads to a promotion.  From that point, black would be very close to having an immediate win.  This move allows you, however, to exchange pawn, and thereby, prevents black from getting a passed pawn.} 28. dxc5 Qxc5 29. Qe1 {?? I'm not sure why Erika pulled back, but this is a terrible blunder.  As this now allows black to win the exchange being a Rook for Bishop on her next move as your Rf1 is now trapped.  Much better would've been to your Rook away from the f file, Erika or find something.  For example, I would've attacked with 29.Rbc1, and after black retreats, I'd answer with 30.Rfe1 or 30.Rfd1 to centralize the Rook.} Ba6 30. Rd1 Bxf1 31. Qxf1 Rb8 {? I normally wouldn't annotate more since white is lost, but I'll continue here since this is a mistake by black.  With that being said, you've gotten better at this, but it's important to be aware of your opponents mistakes, Erika.  And, this move allows you to win back a pawn.  Better would've been 31...Rb7, 31...Qc7, or 31...Rf7 to defend the d7 pawn.} 32. Rxd7 Rbf8 {But, black doubles up and is prepared to do damage here.} 33. Rd2 {? But, this is, yet, another mistake from Erika.  With 3 attackers against 2 defenders, black is going to win back another pawn.  Up until now, I was annotating more, even with a won game from black due to mistakes that she made.  However, she is not going to make any more mistakes and will force the win.  With that being said, I'm not going to annotate anymore here until the very end, as white is, officially, left with no good moves left.  By that, what's also being concluded is that white doesn't get anymore compensation of any kind, even a pawn. } Rf5xf2 34. Rxf2 Rxf2 35. Qd1 Rf5+ 36. Kh1 g5 37. Qxh5 Rf1# {It was an interesting game, but what's important to learn is not to check just because you can since a piece might be hanging.  Even more is not capture, if what you're about to take is protected by a piece.  For example, you're threatening to win a pawn with your Knight, but that pawn is protected by his or her Knight, you shouldn't capture it because that allows the opponent to win a piece for a pawn, Erika.  So, with the first two mistakes, what's important is, "To take is a mistake."  Before, you take it's important to think about and ask yourself how your opponent will respond.  Remembering is key to becoming a better chess player.}
