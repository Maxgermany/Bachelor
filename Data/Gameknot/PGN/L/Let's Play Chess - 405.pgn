1. e4 {In this game I was happy with my patient build up of an attack in a closed position. However I was looking for to an interesting ending when my opponent blundered. Enjoy.} c6 {I don't normally play the Caro but I am trying different openings} 2. Nf3 {!? I haven't faced this before} d5 3. Nc3 Bg4 {Referring to the db for some theory.} 4. h3 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 e6 {A solid pawn structure like the Semi Slav} 6. d3 Nf6 7. Bg5 Be7 8. O-O-O {The first indication of what white is planning. Looking to start a K-Side pawn storm after O-O however I won't commit myself this early} Nbd7 9. a3 {Protecting b4 but Bb4 isn't that great after e5 when h6 Bxf6 gxf6 exf6 Nxf6 black has an isolated h-pawn which can be pressured. } Qc7 10. Bf4 Bd6 11. g3 {!? Expected d4 threatening e5 forcing the exchange} Bxf4+ 12. gxf4 O-O-O {Now black will look to close the position and use his knights. Note how all the pawns are still on the board after 12 moves. very rare in a Caro} 13. e5 {White starts closing it for black. Not that d6 is a hole for a white knight but he can never reach it! While it creates a hole of f5 which can't be defended by a pawn unless he pushes it!} Ng8 14. d4 {Allowing the bishop to move and makes the center stronger however the Bishop can only go to d3 which is a defense role (For the time being) and that removes the defender of the d-pawn. However the Bishop really needs to move as it has no prospects on g2 where it is blocked by black's center and cuts of the half-open g file} Nh6 {Looking to penetrate f5} 15. Bd3 f5 {Shutting up shop unless exf6 e.p. is played. Which must be the move otherwise he has no proscpects as black can build up his kingside play with. Nf7, Rdg1} 16. Qe2 {I don't what this is trying to achieve maybe Bb5 cxb5 Nxb5 but this doesn't achieve much} Nf7 {Preparing a g5 push} 17. Rhg1 Rdg8 18. h4 {Stopping g5 but I can prepare it} g6 19. h5 {Will white open the h-file for me?} Qb6 {I played this to remove the queen from defence of h5} 20. Qe3 Qd8 21. hxg6 {Thank you white} hxg6 {Now black has the ability to push to g5 but also has the h-file} 22. Rgh1 g5 23. fxg5 Nxg5 {Now I control the open g-file} 24. f4 {Kicks the knight but I don't mind because I want to get my rook to g4} Nf7 25. Rxh8 Rxh8 26. b3 {!?} Nh6 27. Be2 Qh4 28. Qf3 Ng4 {Now here is where the game dies} 29. Rh1 {??} Qxh1+ 30. Qxh1 Rxh1+ 31. Kb2 Re1 {Black resigns due to Bf3/d1 Rf1}
