1. d4 d5 2. g3 e6 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. e3 c5 5. dxc5 Bxc5 6. Ne2 O-O 7. O-O Nc6 8. Nbc3 b6 9. a3 Ba6 10. Re1 {I wanted to pull my rook to c8, but I just noticed my that opponent missed:   10.	b4 attacks my bishop on c5, so I must retreat to d6, but 11.	b5 and Bishop and Knight are forked!   } Bxe2 {Bxe2 obviates the problem, but now my opponent can lift his Rook to e2. } 11. Qxe2 {Or his Queen.    I would like to advance my d pawn and attack his knight, but that would open the gate for his light Bishop to take my c6 Knight!  I must eliminate the danger to my c6 Knight and my a8 Rook!} Rc8 {Unpins my d5 pawn.} 12. Rd1 Qd6 13. e4 d4 {I like to bypass and advance.} 14. Nb5 Qe5 15. Bf4 Qh5 16. Qxh5 {Nice and clean.  I like.} Nxh5 17. Bd6 Rfd8 {Backup.} 18. f4 {What?!?} Bxd6 19. e5 {Too little too late?  No!  My h5 Knight is trapped!  What an imaginative fork!} Be7 20. Bxc6 {Too little too late...} Rxc6 21. Nxa7 Rxc2 22. b4 {Now what?    I should probably free my trapped Knight.} g6 23. Nb5 d3 {Saves my pawn for now.} 24. Rdf1 {I see no method to his madness...  I should probably take the lead and play f6.} f6 25. exf6 {I'm thinking to recapture with Nf6, with with Nc3 my goal.} Nxf6 26. Rad1 {I just now noticed my undefended e6 Pawn!  Maybe I can turn the error into a sacrifice.  (Hope springs eternal)} Ne4 27. Rfe1 {X-ray attack - Knight and Pawn both in jeopardy.} Rc4 {Weak defense.} 28. Kf1 {?  c2 looks promising...} d2 29. Re2 {Excellent!  Rc1 should be the beginning of the end...} Rc1 {And so it was.}
