1. c4 {Notes By Travis Colon  My Opponent is not very strong, but I just needed to annotate another game so I can get the feel of what I'm doing. If you guys have any tips for me to help me with my annotating or calculation, it would be much appreciated. Again, this is only my second annotation, so it won't be very good. The game isn't so good either.} Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 {Usually play continues 3.d4 and then 4.e4, yet my opponent chooses e4 and never plays d4. Most likely a lack of experience on his part.} Bg7 4. Nf3 d6 5. Bd3 {? A bad move. Developing the bishop would have been much better after d4. Now the d-pawn is blocked, and white must spend another tempo to move the bishop.} c5 {I was thinking 5...e5, but with the absence of the pawn on e4, I figured I could give my bishop a strong diagonal and at the same time avoid the troublesome Benoni pawn structure granted to white in the usual King's Indian game.} 6. Qa4+ Bd7 7. Qb3 Qc7 {Not the best move in my opinion. I should have went 7...a6 before, as the immediate qc7 is threatened by nb5. I would have to retreat my queen, wasting tempo, as 8.nb5 bxb5 9.cxb5 gives white the two bishops and strong queenside play.} 8. O-O Nc6 {Again, a6 was probably better.} 9. Re1 O-O 10. Nd5 {This brings my bishop to a powerful square and clears the center. Although I lose a pawn, I get excellent spacial compensation, and at the same time I hinder  White's development.} Nxd5 11. exd5 Nd4 12. Nxd4 Bxd4 13. Rxe7 Rfe8 14. Rxe8+ Rxe8 15. Bf1 {Planning for 16.d3} Re1 {! Both bishops are pinned.} 16. d3 Qd8 17. Qxb7 {White gets too greedy, and now...} Qf6 {!! And here, white is in trouble. I can not find a move to save him at this point. Almost everything is pinned. The threat is qxf2, and although his next combination wins the rook, it loses the game, as it does not stop the threat.} 18. Qa8+ Kg7 19. Bh6+ Kxh6 20. Rxe1 Qxf2+ 21. Kh1 Qg1# {My opponent's poor development was an enormous factor. Because he was so underdeveloped, I was allowed more space, particularly, the central dark sqaures. In this case, his dark square weaknesses strengthened my bishop greatly. In chess, you want to bring your pieces to their best squares possible. The point of this is that when your pieces are on strong squares, their mobility is greatly enhanced, granting them a crushing influence on the enemy camp.}
