[Opening "Vienna (C25), Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {Vienna game, an opening which was popular in last decades of 19'th century. Very often it included move 3. f2-f4 and looked like king's gambit, but in this game it was played differently.} Nc6 3. g3 Bc5 4. Bg2 {Paulsen prefers king's fianketto, which leads to original position rich with combinations.} d6 5. d3 Nf6 6. Nge2 {Paulsen plans to play f2-f4, that's why he develops the knight to d2. But to make this move, he also needs to remove the black bishop c4.} Bg4 7. h3 Bd7 8. Na4 Bb6 9. Nxb6 axb6 10. f4 {The pawn f4 attacks central black pawn e5 - that way Paulsen is going to gain the advantage.} exf4 {Taking the white pawn f4 was wrong idea, because black concedes his strong positions in center. Better would be to continue development - 10... O-O or 10... Qe7. White acquires dominance in the center.  } 11. Nxf4 Qe7 12. c4 {This move is characteristic for pre-Steinitz chess, when masters didn't pay mush attention to weak point d4 produced by this pawn move. This is also original Paulsen's style - remember Paulsen's system in Sicilian defence. Louis Paulsen believed that this weak point does not compromise his dominance in the center.} Qe5 13. O-O O-O-O 14. Ne2 Nd4 {This is mistake. Black considered the move 12.c4 as invitation to occupy the point d4 by the knight, and got into the trap, created by the move 14. Ne2. No, black don't loose any material, but they loose strong position in the center, their pieces have to retreat. If black played 14... Qc5+ 15. Kh2 h5, white had difficulties in the center, and also had to defend his position in the king's wing. But now white's advantage becomes obvious.} 15. Bf4 {This is a point, black queen has to fall back, and black loose the honey point d4.} Nxe2+ 16. Qxe2 Qh5 17. g4 Qg6 {It looks that black queen has bad position on g6, better would be to move it into a5.  Paulsen's play looks like provocation, he doesn't mind the hole on d4, and he also takes easily that his king's position is greatly weakened. But his dominance in the center and violated coordination of black pieces make for black finding right plan for defence a difficult task.} 18. a4 {It is a good time to start attack on the queen side - black queen on g6 will not be able to participate in the defence of the black king's position.} h5 19. g5 Nh7 {This is an ugly position of the black knight on the h7 point, but in fact it didn't have better places to retreat to. E8 and g8 points would be even worse.} 20. Qe3 {Defending pawn g5 and preparing for operations against black king.} f6 {right idea, but it is already too late.} 21. a5 Nxg5 22. Kh2 {This is necessary move, because after 22. axb6 Bxh3 black avoided major troubles.} bxa5 23. Rxa5 b6 {Black tries to prevent white to win the pawn after 24.Bxg5 fxg5 25. Rxg5, but loosing this pawn would be the least evil for black.} 24. Ra7 Bc6 25. c5 bxc5 {It could seem that black can successfully defend their position, but...} 26. Qxc5 {Louis Paulsen sacrifices the queen!!!} Qe8 {Declining the sacrifice, black choose the shortest way to the defeat. After 26... dxc5 27. Rxc7+ Kb8 28. Rxg7+ Kc8 29. Rxg6 white have only one pawn more. Their position is much stronger, of course, but they still had to work to achieve victory.} 27. Qa5 Ne6 28. Rc1 g5 {The waste of time, the bishop is not going to retreat. Of course, Nxf4 is bad - Qxc7#. The game could last a little longer after 28... Kd7 29. Rxc6 Ke7 (not 29... Kxc6 30. Qa4+ Kb6 or Kc5, and mate in a couple of moves), and, for example, 30.e5 fxe5 31. Bg5+ Nxg5 32. Raxc7+, and white must win soon.} 29. Qa6+ Kd7 30. Rxc6 gxf4 31. Rxd6+ { - here black resigned: 31... Ke7 32. Rxd6+ etc.}
