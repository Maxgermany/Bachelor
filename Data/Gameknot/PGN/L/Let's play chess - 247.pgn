[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 e5 {Thinking bout the Steinitz game darknite posted. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 {Development. center control. focus on f7.  Blacks h6 feels premature to me. } 4. d4 exd4 { The pawn at d4 isn't going anywhere immediately. White will castle and then be free to mingle about.} 5. O-O Bc5 6. b4 {This position is different than the Steinitz game where Black has a pawn on e4. White plays b4 anyway sacrificing a second pawn for freedom on the dance floor.} Nxb4 7. c3 dxc3 8. Nxc3 {White down -2, but with good mobility available for all minor pieces. Castled and have e1 open for the rook, queen poised on d file. Blacks developed pieces aren't under any immediate threat per se, but at the same time they do not have good squares to move onto. } Qe7 {8. Qe7? Not what I expected and not generally thought to be sound practice. I heard somewhere..."try not to place your queen in front of your king...."______ Well, I was anticipating Nf6 or d6. } 9. Re1 d6 10. Nd5 {Naturally, the rook Whites rook tucks in on the e file exerting pressure on Blacks queen. White follows 9....d6 ( which I think is a little late) with 10. Nd5! And black has to be careful now with the threat of Nc3+! Forks are good, right? At this point black decides to log out and take a break. } Qd7 {Stymies the fork, but black has little mobility.} 11. e5 Kd8 {The e Pawn probes onward and Blacks King seeks safety.} 12. Ba3 {White wants to eliminate the Black knight from it's defensive post and remove the option of any future thoughts on playing Nc2.} Nxd5 13. Bxc5 Nf4 {Here it becomes clear that Black is not interesting in trading. Perhaps, 13....dxBc4 and create space for movement. Doesn't matter now.} 14. exd6 c6 {Black decides belatedly for space, but only improves Whites dark squared bishop. } 15. Ne5 Qf5 {Driving the queen and setting up 16. Nxf7+!. White has succeeded in gaining control of f7 and the central files.  } 16. Nxf7+ Kd7 {The only refuge.} 17. Qd4 Rh7 {The knight on f7 is placed too well to bother picking off the rook on h7. The queen moves forward to get a better angle. !7.... Rh7 accomplishes nothing.} 18. Re7+ Nxe7 {Trading down rook to knight, but gaining the e7 square.} 19. dxe7+ Ke8 20. Qd8# {Not exactly a classic for the ages, but White follows thru on the basics. }
