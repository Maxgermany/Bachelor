1. d4 {I don't really like to annotate the games I lost, but, as humans learn from their mistakes, I'll try to annotate each game that I lose.} d5 2. Bf4 {Sarratt attack} Nc6 {instead of c5, black preferred Nc6, not the best move} 3. e3 Nf6 4. f3 Bf5 5. Bb5 e6 6. Nc3 Bd6 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 8. Bg5 O-O 9. e4 {white tend to control the center} dxe4 10. fxe4 Bg4 11. e5 {bad move. Qxg4, trading queens and bishops is better, as after 11.Qxg4 Nxg4 and 12.Bxd8 Rxd8 white has a positional advantage, controlling the center } Bxd1 12. Rxd1 {Again, a bad move, exf6 would have been better, as it destroys the castle structure.} Be7 {Taking advantage of white's last mistake} 13. exf6 Bxf6 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 15. Nf3 Qf4 {useless move, the queen can't attack alone. I think that Rd8 would be better, as it pins the d pawn to the rook and an eventual c5 would be possible} 16. O-O {Excellent. Defending the king is the best what you can do when youre down material and not attacking} Qe3+ 17. Kh1 Rfd8 18. Rd3 {The player with the black pieces finally observed the pin, but it's too late, as} Qf4 {Qf4 is the only move that takes advantage of the pin, but here white have a very strong move, Ne5, that both, defends the pawn, and attacks the queen with the rook, but firstly, white need to defend the rook} 19. Kg1 c5 {Black didn't figure out white's plan} 20. Ne5 Rxd4 {and, moreover, a mechanical mistake that loses the queen} 21. Rxf4 Rxf4 22. Rd7 Rd4 23. Rxc7 Rb8 24. Rxc5 Rxb2 {The biggest mistake of the game, mate in 2. I should have played h6} 25. Rc8+ Rd8 {}
