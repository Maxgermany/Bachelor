1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nd7 {Philidor Defence:} 4. Bc4 Nb6 {A very odd move in  philidor: well having no choice I drop the B down } 5. Bb3 Qe7 {Is black really threatening or just simply scaring} 6. Nc3 Be6 {offering to trade the Bs or one may say preparing for ...,d5} 7. O-O Bxb3 8. axb3 {better than 8.cxb3. Text keeps the ps intact towards the center} Nf6 9. Bg5 {A very useful pin} h6 {questioning the B} 10. Bh4 {prefers the retreat & keeps the pin intact} g5 {breaks the pin but at the cost of p weakness} 11. Bg3 g4 {?! what is black upto. With K in the center & development still to come this will cause more harm than good} 12. Nh4 {aiming for f5 square. A very useful outpost} a6 {Probably preparing for 0-0-0} 13. Nf5 {A strong threat on blacks Q.} Qd7 {This drops a p. } 14. dxe5 { Exchanges &opens the lines} dxe5 15. Bxe5 {Picks a good center p} Qxd1 {This swapp only aids white } 16. Raxd1 Nbd7 {?! this now drops a piece.} 17. Rxd7 Kxd7 {If 17...,Nxd7; then 18.Bxg8 - wins the R} 18. Bxf6 {this wins N. Now for 2 minor pieces P, whites R is lost. Not a bad bargain.} Rg8 19. Rd1+ Kc6 20. Nd5 {Threat is Nd7  forking both K & g8R} h5 {A punch drunk move!} 21. Nde7+ Bxe7 22. Nxe7+ Kb5 23. Nxg8 {Its all over.  } Rxg8 24. Rd7 { double attack on c7 & f7-P} Kb6 {Helpless} 25. Rxf7 Rg6 26. e5 {Advancing the passer} Kc6 {Coming to stop the passer} 27. c4 {A better choice was 27.e6,Kd6; 28.e7,Kd7; 29.Rf8 - which was a quick route to win...} b6 28. b4 Rg8 29. b5+ axb5 30. cxb5+ Kxb5 31. Rxc7 Ra8 {Hoping for a backrank #!} 32. g3 {creating a flee} Ra2 {attacks b2-p but it wont work due to} 33. e6 {advances the passer & defends the b2-p} Ra1+ 34. Kg2 Re1 35. e7 Re6 {scaring whites B & here I must admit black managed to do it.} 36. Bh4 {Better was 36.Rc8 & black is helpless against whites p promotion, whether he captures the B or not} Kb4 37. Rc8 b5 38. e8=Q {Promotes} Rxe8 39. Rxe8 Kb3 {Still hanging for what?} 40. Bf6 b4 41. h3 Kc2 42. hxg4 hxg4 43. Re4 b3 44. Rxg4 Kb1 {Here it seems after making the move Black had enough for the day.}
