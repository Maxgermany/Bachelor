[Opening "KGA (C34), Fischer defence"]

1. e4 {My opponent chose a very sharp opening (King's gambit) but after 6.Ng1 (a very defensive variation) he lingered in the quest for an equal game, at some point I even offered a poisoned pawn that he refused to accept, and I went on to improve my space advantage on the king's wing, undermining his blocking pawns and creating two connected passed pawns.. still I've had some trouble bringing them to promotion until a final imprecision by white precipitated the events allowing me to force the promotion, he resign before!} e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d6 4. d4 g5 5. h4 {after g4 Ng1 we will enter a very sharp variation were white hopes to get compensation for the sacrificed pawn on the weakness of black's g4 and f4 pawns, black must keep the initiative and probably give back the pawn for some kind of advantage...} g4 6. Ng1 {now I think Qf6 might be a good choice defending f4 and preparing the long castle, while at the same time removing the queen from the d column that might became open thus not allowing white to exchange queens if the d column opens up, f5, Nf6 and Bh6 are other common choices} Qf6 7. Nc3 {surprised me a little this move by white...} Be6 {controlling the a2-g8 diagonal, and developing preparing the long castle also invites d5 if played I have Bd7} 8. Qe2 Qxd4 {of course now white has Qb5 Nd7 Qxb7 Rb8 Qxc7 but then he loses initiative allowing g3 with the powerful threat Qf2... also with Qxd4 I've created a weakness on white's pawn structure that maybe reveal itself useful on the endgame} 9. Qb5+ {expected} Nd7 10. Nge2 {white didn't like the pawn capture variation... he opts for Nxf4 with the idea Nxe6} Qc5 {if Qxc5 I have Nxc5... white still has Nxf4 but I'll end up better...} 11. Nxf4 Bg7 {developing and eyeing the c3 knight with the idea of creating another weak point in white's pawn structure h5 might be in order next to secure the g4 pawn and an escape for my h8 rook} 12. Bd2 {now the c3 knight is no longer and immediate objective} O-O-O {I'll castle long as would white probably do} 13. O-O-O a6 {forcing decisions by white} 14. Qxc5 {nice, I'm not forced to compromise my pawn structure} Nxc5 {forced} 15. b4 Nd7 {forced} 16. Be2 h5 {forced in view of Nxe6 fxe6 Bxg4, now I'll be happy to see white capture my light squared bishop} 17. Rhf1 Re8 18. Kb1 Ne7 {the idea being Ne7-g6 to force white to chose either Nxe6 or Nxg6 or even worst to move back his knight from f4} 19. Kb2 {white has nothing better than to wait for me to define my strategy so he moves his king arround} Ng6 {now if Nxg6 I'll have 3 vs 2 pawns on the kings wing} 20. Nxe6 fxe6 {opening the f column to occupy latter} 21. Bg5 Be5 {preventing g3 and blocking white's e pawn} 22. Kb3 {and again white plays a wait move with nothing better... he will soon run out of this delaying move and play a bad move} Rhf8 {now I'll occupy the open column} 23. Rxf8 Rxf8 {exchanging pieces only help me as I have a greater mobility, Rf2 will follow} 24. Bc4 Rf2 {as planed} 25. Bxe6 {no problem I'll exchange it any day, white's e pawn is blocked and in exchange I'll get a passed pawn} Rxg2 26. Nd5 Rg3+ {preparing Rg1 to gain as much push space as I can} 27. Rd3 {expected} Rg1 {preparing g3} 28. c3 g3 29. Rd2 Rb1+ {to prepare Rh1 which prevents Bh3, now if Kc2 I have Rh2 with a skewer that forces white either to capture my rook and allow promotion or to allow me to capture his rook also allowing promotion} 30. Kc2 Rh1 {ergo...} 31. Kb3 {?? allows me to pick another pawn, promotion will soon be happening or white must give a piece to prevent it, after the next moves I was forced to reaccess my ?? classification to this move, now I only think is dubious ?!... let's see the aftermath of this! } Nxh4 {Bxh4 Rxh4 and I have an almost open lane to promotion, white must give up a piece to prevent it...} 32. Ne7+ {! this zwischenzug surprised me... now I'll have one less piece as...} Kb8 {...I can't play Rd8 due to the discovered check threat... so white will be able to get my d7 knight for free...} 33. Bxh4 {! again a good move interposing this move before Bxd7 forces my reply or else I'll lose one of my passed pawns} Rxh4 {I still have two passed pawns but white can now sacrifice a piece for them I'm considering play Rxe4 after Bxd7 or Rh2 (great decision ???)} 34. Bxd7 Rh2 {preparing g2 if Rxh2 then gxh2 and I'll promote my pawn} 35. Rd1 {? now I have a forced sequence to get a piece back} g2 {forces 36.Rg1 and opens g3 for my bishop intended to play 36...Bg3-f2 forcing promotion or the loss of the rook for white, so white must play 37.Bh3 sacrificing his bishop for my g pawn} 36. Rg1 Bg3 {as planed now the idea is to play Bf2} 37. Bh3 {white sacrifices a piece for that threatening pawn} Rxh3 {I'm glad to accept it} 38. Rxg2 c6 {preventing Nd5 and freeing c7 for my king when he does march towards the centre of the board } 39. Nf5 {inviting Be5 the best placement for my bishop eyeing both h2 and the c3 pawn} Be5 {c3 and h2 under my control} 40. Rc2 {forced} Kc7 {as previously prepared by 38.c6 here I'm advancing my king towards the centre while at the same time defend d6 (in preparation for Bxc3), the idea is to play h4 and then prepare Bxc3 to win me a pawn, then I'll be happy to fight against the knight and king with just my king and two extra pawns as the e pawn will pose no difficulty and the knight will be condemned to guard my h pawn away from the fight...} 41. Rc1 {a wait move by white} h4 {as intended} 42. a4 {another wait move} Rh2 {to prepare h3} 43. Rf1 Rh3 {again aimed at c3} 44. Rc1 {white returned to a previous position} Bf6 {a different move protecting the h pawn and shielded from the rook by white's knight} 45. b5 {and he moved a pawn so no threefold repetition draw here} Rf3 {threatening d5-dxe4 or if exd5 then Rxf5, pushing the h pawn might not be and easy task now I might try to exchange pieces, I'll be also happy if I exchange Rook and bishop for the c3 pawn} 46. Rd1 Rxc3+ {finally I'll get the point... white will have to give up material for the h pawn or face promotion, he has to chose from three moves: a) Kb2 Rd3+ discovered check Rxd1 and is bishop vs knight with two pawns advantage and the knight committed to the defence of a far away rook pawn b) Ka2 h3 Rxd6 Be5 Rh6 h2... and he may get it but is again B vs N c) Kb4 c5 Ka5 b6+ Kxa6 Ra3 now he can lose his rook on d4 or a1 or even play the more stuburn a5 to see me reply with Bc3 and he is lost} 47. Ka2 h3 {let them grab a pawn I'll push the h forward and we have a runner...} 48. Nxd6 {greedy! Rxd6 was "better"... for me... but then again this is fine also, white is threatening a fork with Ne8+} Be5 {leaves the fork threat and defends h2 with tempo, and my opponent should resign soon...} 49. Nf7 Bf4 {Rc1!  and h2} 50. bxa6 {}
