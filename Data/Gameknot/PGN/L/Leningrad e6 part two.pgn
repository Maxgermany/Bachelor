1. d4 f5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. c4 O-O 6. O-O d6 7. Nc3 Qe8 {last book move } 8. Nb5 {White threatens to win material: Nb5xc7 Alternative variation: 8. Be3 e6 ; which is supposed to be better, however my aim is e6 after d5 and a kingside attack, so Be3 was not really on my mind. } Qd7 9. d5 {This push gains space } a6 {Black threatens to win material: a6xb5 Alternative variation: 9... c5 10. Qb3 sort of waste of tempi, but it can be usefull in case of a later ... b5 } 10. Nbd4 Ne4 {Alternative variation: 10... e5 [is noteworthy] 11. dxe6 Qe7  I do not really know why black intend to go here at this stage.  e5 which tries to bust black out of his cramped position would certainly have been healthier. } 11. Ne6 Re8 {Alternative variation: 11... Rf7 12. Nfd4  Time to remove the leningrad bishop and take away a very important piece of this structure } 12. Nxg7 {Alternative variation: 12. Nfd4 Nf6 13. Nxg7 Kxg7 14. Ne6+ Kg8 15. Re1 $18  The Kingside attack starts!} Kxg7 13. Qd4+ {Alternative variation: 13. Ng5 Nxg5 14. Qd4+ Kg8 15. Bxg5 c5   I did not want to trade of my second knight, since my pieces are way better positioned than blacks. } Kf7 {Alternative variation: 13... Kg8  [and Black can hope to survive] } 14. Bh6 Nf6 {!? the only decent move at this stage, since a Qg7 would be really devastating} 15. Ng5+ Kg8 16. Bh3 {Alternative variation: 16. c5 dxc5 17. Qxc5 Qd6  I do not understand this proposal of rybka, maybe someone can clairify it for me.} c5 {Alternative variation: 16... e5 17. Qh4 Qe7 18. f3   Black tries to break out} 17. Qc3 {Alternative variation: 17. Qh4 Qc7 18. f3   of course not dxc, since it is needed to deal with an eventual e5. I saw 17. Qh4 but I do not really see an immediate continuation. Still white is overwhelming the king-side while all of blacks remaining pieces are cut off} b5 {Alternative variation: 17... Qd8} 18. e4 {Deflection: f5  My idea at this point was to play e4 and maybe follow up with f4 and e5} b4 {?? a blunder in a bad position Alternative variation: 18... fxe4 19. Bxd7 [Deflection Pinning] Alternative variation: 18... Nxe4 19. Qg7# [ Mate attack Deflection] Alternative variation: 18... -- 19. exf5 [Threat] gxf5 20. Ne6 [ Combination] Alternative variation: 18... Qb7 [Only Hope] 19. Rae1 Nbd7 20. exf5 Nf8 21. g4 bxc4 } 19. Qe3 {Again the target is the weak e6 square} Ng4 {??  Alternative variation: 19... Rd8 [there is nothing better in the position]  This ruins black completely, it will open up the file for my queen and all hell can start to break loose. } 20. Bxg4 fxg4 {Alternative variation: 20... Rf8 [hardly improves anything] 21. exf5 Qe8 22. Ne6 Bxe6 23. Qxe6+ Qf7 24. fxg6 hxg6 25. Rae1   It's the end of the 20th turn and neither blacks knight nor blacks bishop are really developed, the rook on the a file is completely useless, whereas white just has to play f3 and it will have total domination on the f file } 21. Qf4 {"drop by mate threat" after 22. Qf7+ Kh8 23. Bg7#} e5 22. dxe6 e.p. Qe7 {Mate in 3: 23. Qxf7+ Qxf7 24. xf7 Kh8 25 xe8R#  The game and annotation was very entertaining for me, at least, since it was a solid attack that focused mainly on one square/was shaped by one thought. (unfortunately my other games of the tournament won't turn out that lucky for me :D)  Hope you enjoyed and thx for all incoming clarification.}
