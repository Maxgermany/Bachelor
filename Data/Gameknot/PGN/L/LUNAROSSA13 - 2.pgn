1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Najdorf; now i learned.} 6. Bg5 {hehe, i know it so wellll} e6 {my favorite defense (so, you know you can't play it with me for next games ) :-)} 7. f4 {the strongest attack} Nbd7 {I think I now prefer to play black with Najdorf...} 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O {classic one} b5 {classic of classic} 10. Bd3 Bb7 11. Rhe1 Be7 {preparing the castling that will never come} 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Bxb5 {the brave move!} axb5 14. Ndxb5 {2 pawns and an attack for the bishop... it is a good idea, of course...} Qb8 15. Nxd6+ {and now 3 pawns!} Ke7 {not quite sure this is the best move i made. But i considered the 2 others -Kf8 and Kd8- and i did not like them. } 16. Nxf7 {excellent move} Bxc3 {Not Kxf6 followed by the terminating Rxd7} 17. bxc3 {bad pawn structure; was Qxc3 not better?} Rc8 {the good news is that I save my rook...} 18. Rxd7+ {increasing the pressure... but at what cost!} Kxd7 19. Rd1+ Ke7 20. Ne5 {now the "Ã©preuve de force" starts: white still has the attack, but black can try to reduce it.} Rd8 {reducing} 21. Rxd8 {accepting the reducing.} Qxd8 22. Qh5 {many threats... looking for forks and mate...} Bxe4 {blocking some possibilities} 23. Qf7+ {scary, isn't it?} Kd6 {with confidence } 24. Qxg7 {gnap} Qc7 {come to meeeeeeee (of course to avoid the fork)} 25. Nf7+ Kc6 {really, i felt confident, here...} 26. Qf6 {avoiding the trade and attacking again... these whites are sharp...} Bf5 {black still thinks about escaping the attack and grouping its force on the white king at the same time: seen how the three pieces are pointing undirectly on it?} 27. Ne5+ Kb7 28. g4 {this means: black, you have to lose e6...} Bxg4 {but i decided not to lose e6!} 29. Nxg4 Rxa2 30. Qd4 {still looking for an attack to produce... But black has more margins now. The last possible threat could come from the 2 pawns on f and h columns... } Ra6 {defense again... for the last time} 31. c4 Rd6 {and now... attack} 32. Qe4+ Kc8 33. f5 Qa5 {threatening too many things: can you see them all?}
