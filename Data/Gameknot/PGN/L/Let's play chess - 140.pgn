1. c3 {The Saragossa opening. I don't see any strategy to it.} e5 {I respond by grabbing the center} 2. e4 Nf6 3. Qa4 {White defends with his queen. It's best not to move the queen this early in the game because developing pieces can attack it and force it to move.} Nc6 4. Bc4 {White attacks black's weak f7 pawn.} Nxe4 {White's bishop blocked the queen's rank, allowing this capture.} 5. d3 {White attacks the knight.} Nc5 {Black moves his knight to safety and attacks the white queen, forcing it to move.} 6. Qc2 d6 {Black gains a diagonal for his c8 bishop.} 7. b4 {White attacks black's knight again.} Ne6 8. a4 Be7 9. Nd2 {More advancing.} O-O {Black castles.} 10. b5 {Another attack! White's pawns are suffocating.} Na5 11. Ba2 {Black chases away the bishop.} Nc5 12. Bb1 {White's move seems pointless.} Bf5 {An attack on the d3 pawn} 13. g4 {What's this?} Nxd3+ {Black plans to grab the g4 pawn later.} 14. Kf1 Nc4 {Black forgot about the g4 pawn} 15. gxf5 Nf4 {Black moves his knight away from the queen.} 16. f6 Bxf6 {Black takes the pawn without noticing that...} 17. Qxh7# {...this was going to happen. }
