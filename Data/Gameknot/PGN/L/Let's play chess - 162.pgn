1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {This is book. Shortly I'll end up with the knight pairing on c3/d4 and White has a strong position with which to bust the Sicilian. I'm up to a 70% win rating overall, closer to 80 for this particular line against the Sicilian so, suffice to say, the days of the Sicilian are numbered methinks!} Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 {This specific opening line is unique for Tips according to my personal dbase, but the position of those knights ending up side-by-side in the Sicilian (irrespective of the rest of the board) isn't. I've said before a good knight pairing (though hard to both construct and hold onto) is worth more than a bishop pair, at least to Tipsy so no fear from here!} Be6 {That's a rare position for the Sicilian and I dislike the lead movement of 8.f4. 8.Bd3 has only been tried twice in World database history for 100% victory to Black, but I don't particularly care. As any good scientist will tell you, the smaller the sample size the less reliable the results. And, though I do love a pawn chain, the mealy movement of the f pawn in this position appeals to the tipsy not, especially since I find the Sicilian susceptible to a heavy weight of material on the queenside. I also find that the impressive side-by-side combination of the knights and bishops should suit my desire for aggressive space-grabbing in the opening and early middle (regardless of what opening I play). GERONIMO!} 8. Bd3 {Maw ha ha ha puny Sicilan! Fear my manoeuvering! The Tipsy comes to crush you once more! } Nbd7 {O-O, Qd2/e2 setting up for O-O-O or f3? OR f4? Eh? Have a go? I do remember some senior player here on GK telling me the f pawn should never move 1 in its first movement, save for when necessitated in end-games. I've lived by that for a long time, applying it also to the c pawn. The exception is when I've had the chance to erect pawn chains though usually they were much larger pawn chains than 3 when I've broken that rule. Hmmmm. } 9. Qd2 b5 10. O-O-O Be7 11. f3 Nb6 12. g4 Nc4 13. Bxc4 bxc4 14. Na1 O-O 15. h3 Qa5 {Sneaky attempt at mate brewing here with Rb8 to surely follow very soon. At the very least Black is attempting to overwhelm White's fortress. We shall have to see about that!} 16. g5 Nd7 17. Kb1 {not a usual move for Tips but neatly relieves the mounting pressure on the a and b pawns and knight on a1} Rab8 {If a good move too early or late can be a bad move, then a bad move delayed can become a good move!  Rab8 was expected long ago and has lost potency with the delay. Conversely, whilst the planned riposte in Ba7 has also lost sting, Nd5, long considered, but delayed due to Qside hijinx from Black, has now ripened and is ready for the picking! All Black's good moves are turning poor, all White's poor moves are turning good! Black needs to tread very, very carefully in this next passage of play or be opened up cruelly.} 18. Nd5 Qd8 {? Drops a pawn. Was expecting 18...Bxd5. Now 19 Nxe7+ Qxe7 20 Qxd6 Qxd6 21. Rxd6 a5 22 h4 and it's White's turn to turn the screws!} 19. Nxe7+ Qxe7 20. Qxd6 Qxd6 21. Rxd6 c3 22. Nb3 {cuts off any nonsense. Actually I think Black may have just dropped another pawn here, can't be sure. If 22...cxb2 23Rxa6 White restores its pawn advantage. BUT, I'm not sure they will be able to get any pieces into position to support the isolated b pawn ere the king snaffles it up. Will have to analyse. } cxb2 23. Rxa6 Rfc8 24. Kxb2 {As predicted, Black down two pawns. Whilst the sum of Black's parts looks menacing; two rooks, bishop and knight potentially combining for an attack on the kside, White's position is far too spacious to be really concerned with the whole. Counterplay with White's own rooks could well have Black soon running scared. } Bc4 25. Rd6 Bxb3 26. cxb3 Nc5 27. Bxc5 Rxc5 28. Rhd1 {Here comes those rooks! } g6 {Black is trying to prepare an escape route for the King, but the real threat is not mate, but pushing Black into a position where they cannot stop White's superior pawn numbers from promoting. With Black's own rook's disconnected, this late middle is trivial for the Tips! } 29. Rd6d8+ Rxd8 30. Rxd8+ Kg7 31. Rd2 {From here, White clearly wins by force. Black resigns. A good game by Black but yet again, Tipsy smites the Sicilian! }
