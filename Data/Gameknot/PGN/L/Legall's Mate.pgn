[Black "sreeunited (1053)"]
[Opening "Philidor (C41), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 {e4 is a strong sensible opening which immediately places a pawn in the center and opens up line for the queen and bishop.} e5 {A good response to e4, for the same reasons as white. } 2. Nf3 {Nf3, a strong move that places pressure on the black pawn at e5.} d6 {d6 is not the best move to make, to a cautious player it may be worth playing but d6 creates a cramped position for black. } 3. Bc4 {Bc4, this places whites bishop on a strong square to extend control.} f6 {f6, a weak move as now three pawns have been moved without a single piece having developed. f6 also takes away the knights strong developing square.} 4. Nc3 {Nc3, now all of the knights for white are developed as well as a bishop, black has just three pawns.} Bg4 {Black expects the knight to be pinned to the queen.} 5. Nxe5 {The beginning of Legall's mate. Surprise! WHat is this white has made a blunder and has lost his queen to the black bishop and it is only move 5.} Bxd1 {Black took the bait. Checkmate in two moves.} 6. Bf7+ {Notice the white knight on e5 protects the bishop and stops the king from moving to d7. } Ke7 {Forced.} 7. Nd5# {The knight from c3 seals the deal. A tip to avoid this situation if you are black is to avoid taking the queen.}
