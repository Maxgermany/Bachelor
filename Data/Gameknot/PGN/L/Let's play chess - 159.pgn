1. c4 {Standard English opening.} e5 2. d4 e4 {Queen's gambit passed.} 3. e3 f5 4. f4 Bb4+ 5. Bd2 {A bit premature. A close check this early in the game yields few advantages.} Bxd2+ 6. Qxd2 Ne7 {Why not KnF6? KnE7 not only limits the knight's maneuverability, but completely boxes in the Queen who otherwise has a nice diagonal track to develop against white's weak side. } 7. Nc3 h5 8. g3 g6 9. Nh3 d6 10. d5 h4 11. Qd4 Rf8 {My intent here was to capitalize on the KnE7 error. Black compounded the error by Rf8 instead of Rh7. Now, I'm watching the h column very carefully.} 12. Ng5 hxg3 {One of black's mistakes was allowing the h column to open - you'll see how I capitalize on this later. } 13. hxg3 Na6 {Knights on the rim are dim...could've backed my queen off with a KnC7.} 14. Ne6 {Computer analysis called this a blunder for sacrificing my knight. My focus here was on preventing a King escape on f or d 7. Any advice for what I might've missed?} Bxe6 15. dxe6 Nc5 16. Rh8 Nxe6 17. Rxf8+ {Computer analysis called this an error too. I was planning on QG7 but KnE6 stopped that.} Kxf8 18. Qf6+ Ke8 19. Qxe6 a5 {This move was very perplexing. I thought for sure black would've gone for a queen trade with QC8. Fear of losing the queen seals black's fate.} 20. Nd5 c6 21. Nf6+ Kf8 22. c5 d5 23. O-O-O a4 24. Ba6 {Willingly sacrificed to allow Rh1 while making black waste a move.} bxa6 25. Rh1 g5 26. Rh8+ Kg7 27. Rh7+ Kg6 28. Qf7# {Black queen never got out of the stable.}
