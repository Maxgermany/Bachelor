1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {At this point, nothing really interesting has happened. However, Black makes a chain of mistakes from here on out.} f6 {This type of move is usually not advisable this early in the game. It blocks the king-side knight from using its main developing square, and it exposes the king along the h5-e8 diagonal. It also seriously hampers the king-side bishop's ability to develop.} 4. Bc4 {Here the computer suggested I do 4. Nc3, but this move did just fine. My thinking was that I wanted to make it more difficult for black to castle later on. Getting more control of the center was nice, too. In fact, little did I know, but thanks to a couple major mistakes on Black's part, my bishop became an integral part of a quick, decisive attack.} Ne7 {Here's Black's next mistake. There are at least two reasons why this isn't a good move. First, it does nothing to address the problem that he has at e5. At first glance, it looks like there's no problem there. I have two attackers, and he has two defenders, but as it turns out, his d-pawn has a little too much on its plate. The second reason why this isn't good is because it doesn't help black free up any space. Nc6, as suggested by the computer, would've been better because it would've been quite helpful in defending the e5 square. } 5. dxe5 {At this point, Black has a critical decision to make. Even I was not aware of how dearly Black could be crippled at this juncture had Black made a mistake here. As it turns out, it is not a good idea for Black to capture my e5 pawn at all. Capturing with the f-pawn leaves black rather vulnerable on the king-side. Plus, I can safely capture his pawn with my knight because, as I said, the d-pawn is a little tied up at the moment. Unfortunately for Black, he doesn't realize this.} dxe5 {This was by far Black's biggest mistake. Do you see why? By leaving the d-file, Black's new e-pawn has paved the way for me to deal a major blow. The computer suggests Bg4 instead.} 6. Bf7+ {The fatal blow. Black has no choice but to capture my bishop.} Kxf7 7. Qxd8 {Having lost his queen, Black chose to resign. I didn't realize that I would be able to launch such a powerful attack that quickly until Black's final fatal blunder.}
