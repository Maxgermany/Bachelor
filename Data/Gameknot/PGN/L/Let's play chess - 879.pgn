1. e4 {I am terribly embarrassed for losing this game.  I was in a good position, then a slight lapse in concentration and the game is lost.  Do not do anything else while playing chess,  My Standard opening when playing white.} e5 {Normal response.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 h6 {I wasn't really expecting this but its no problem.} 4. Nc3 {Keep my development going.} c6 {Preparing to push d5} 5. O-O {Castle to safety} Nf6 6. d3 a6 7. a3 Nbd7 {So far no problems} 8. Nh4 {Looking to get my knight to f5} b5 9. Bb3 Nc5 10.

Re1 O-O-O 17. a4 {Trying to open the queenside.} Rg8 18. axb5 cxb5 19. Nd5 Qc6 {Black lining up mate on Qxg2 but i have this in mind.} 20. Qxf5+ Rd7 21. Nf6 {There is my break in concentration.  Not seeing the whole board after i knew it was coming.  After a blunder like this i deserve to lose the game.  I was very angry with myself after this.  I consider this a very beginner blunder.  Something my child would do,  who does not play chess.  } Qxg2# {Black saw the gap and jump on it.  Perfect example of why not to do anything else while playing chess.  I gave the game away.}
