Unbelievably, I managed to hold out, despite heavy losses: half my pawns, and my light-square bishop (which en prise early in the game) remain, along with the king, against seven pawns (only one removed on my third move). Is a bishop the third best piece to help the king and pawns attack enemy pawns (after a queen and a rook), due to its range?} b6 30. Kd3 Ke7 31.
