[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {.In this game all started with a quality sacrifice that removed a defender, and won several pieces, partly due to bad defences by white, yet black became a bit too "hungry" and garbed one too many of white pieces and ended up by losing the initiative to white's favour, white also scarified a quality, to increase the pressure over black's king, that had to play precisely to avoid mate, in the end, black managed to regain initiative and the material imbalance in his favour lead to a win.} c5 2. d3 {So we have a unorthodox Sicilian 940 games in Gameknot database} g6 {to challenge white's weak dark squares along the main diagonal, I'll put my bishop on g7} 3. Nd2 {? blocks his own bishop, the idea is maybe Nb3? or Nc4?} Bg7 4. Ne2 {?? white's two last moves loses much time the idea must be to place a knight in g3 and the other in f3, but goes against one of the basic opening principles, not to move a piece more than once in the opening.} d6 {now opened the path of the light squares bishop, I considered also d5 as white didn't have Nbc3 but had Nec3 (losing two tempi) so the line exd5 Qxd5 Nc3 Qf5 Be2 Nf6 was at best even for black, as black would have lost some tempi with the attack on the queen also...} 5. Ng3 {I don't see the point of Ng3 now, certainly not after g6 } Nc6 {keep developing my pieces unlike white that has a somewhat cramped field, with difficulties to develop both his bishops} 6. c3 {a bad choice, probably to avoid Nb4 or Nd4 or even to limit the g7 bishop scope, but weakens both the b2 and the d3 pawns} b5 {Gets me more space in the queen's wing to counter-attack against white's week points d3 and b2} 7. Be2 b4 {keeping the plan now several strategic ideas came to my mind: a) a great outpost for my c6 knight at d4 if white captures the b pawn or advances the c pawn to c4, either way white can only challenge the knight location with a piece, which could lead to a new strategy of exchanging the dark squares bishop... b) wining a pawn if white doesn't further defend the c pawn (bxc3 bxc3 Bxc3) c) some x-ray tactics on the main diagonal or against the uncastled king} 8. Qc2 bxc3 9. bxc3 Qa5 {The intersection of the two diagonals a5-e1 and a1-h8 has just became very week and both the Ra1 and the Nd2 can became threatened } 10. Bb2 Rb8 {It's the natural move to place the rook on the open column, plus I have the opportunity to temporarily sacrifice a quality to win it back plus a pawn as the c3 pawn is under-defended } 11. O-O Rxb2 12. Qc1 {? Surprised me I expected Qxb2 Bxc3 to skewer the rook} Rxd2 {ok, so it's time to pick one more piece, if 13.Qxd2 Bxc3 wins the a1 rook} 13. Rb1 Qxa2 {to pick two more minor pieces for my rook} 14. d4 Rxe2 15. Nxe2 Qxe2 {white's d4 was also nice for me, as now I can get my queen back to defend the c8 bishop if needed} 16. d5 {I have four miner pieces for my rook, but now white has the initiative, so I'll have to defend against his tries} Nd8 {Here I considered also a strong possibility of playing Ne5, but my knight would be exposed to f4, and I also didn't like to leave the king so far away from one more piece as the others are still undeveloped, so Nd8 is probably fine although not much active the knight will overprotect the key square b7, and add another barrier to my kings protection if ever white plays Rb8.} 17. Rb8 {white keeps the initiative with another blow, now against Bc8, my options were: a) Bd7 with the idea of defending it with Qg4, Nf6 and 0-0  b) Qa6 just to keep the queen close to white's action, while defending c8} Qa6 {I chose Qa6...} 18. Qb2 Bd7 {and now Bd7, proving my Qa6 not to be the best choice} 19. Ra1 {gains a tempo with the attack on my queen} Qd3 {!? so Rxa7 is impossible for now, due to white's week back rank} 20. g3 {necessary} Qxc3 {offering the exchange, leaves white with several options to chose from: a) Qxc3 Bxc3 Rxa7 Nf6 Ra8 0-0 and after further exchanges black is still ok with at least three pieces and one pawn against one rook and a protected king b) Qb7!? profiting from the pin on Nd8, allows Qxa1+ Kg2 Nf6 and the black king will be safe again Rxd8+ Kxd8 forced Qb8+ Bc8 forced, and black can't castle, bur nowt due to a7 protecting b6, c5 protecting b4, Bc8 protecting b7, Kd8 protecting c7, and Qa1 protecting a7, b1 and b2, white's queen only has 4 squares to be on (a8, b5, b3, and b8) for now c) Rxd8+ ! white's choice   } 21. Rxd8+ {! nice move, sacrifices the quality to keep the king uncastled and to bring the queen to the 8th with tempo, I overlooked this move and started to be worried} Kxd8 {only move} 22. Qb8+ {with tempo, forcing Bc8} Bc8 {only move} 23. Rxa7 {...I was only safe from certain mate due to my a7 pawn it's sacrifice gave me one tempo to use wisely, now I need to get to  the h3 c8 diagonal to defend my c8 bishop from Ra8, both a4 and b5 are out of question, and the same for e6 and f5...} Qe1+ {! to open another hole in the h3-c8 diagonal, so I can squeeze in my queen} 24. Kg2 {only move} Qxe4+ {now I have two safe squares to get to h3-c8 diagonal} 25. Kg1 {forced as f3 loses to a mate in 3: 25..Qe2+ 26.Kg1 (26.Kh1 Qf1++) 26...Bd4+ 27.Kh1 Qf1++} Qg4 {better than Qf5, as if 26.f3 white loses to a mate in 3: 26...Bd4+ 27.Kf1 (27.Kg2 Qh3 28.Kh1 Qf1++) 27....Qxf3+ 28.Ke1 Bc3++} 26. Qc7+ {! coercing the king away from Bc8} Ke8 {only move} 27. Qc6+ Kf8 {better than Kd8 were white could have tried some repetition of moves} 28. Ra8 Bd4 {Opens g7 for my king and pins f2, now I regret not having played 25...Qf5 instead of 25...Qg4, } 29. Rxc8+ Kg7 {I've considered Qxd8, and trying to win the resulting endgame three minor pieces plus two extra pawns vs queen} 30. Ra8 Qe2 {aimed against Ra2, to capture f2 pawn} 31. Kg2 Qxf2+ 32. Kh3 {forced as Kh1, meets Qf1++} Qf1+ {an white king is forced to mate in two, 33.Kg4 Qf5 34.Kh4 Bf6++ or 34.Kh4 Bf6+ 35.Kg4 Nh6++  or 34.Kg4 Nh6+ 35.Kg5 (or 35.Kh4) Bf6++} 33. Kh4 Bf6+ {}
