1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nd7 3. Nf3 f6 {Not recommended unless you know it very well. It opens the BK to attacks by the Q on h5, if supported by Nxg6.} 4. Nbd2 e6 5. e4 {Opening the diag for the Q. } dxe4 6. Nxe4 Ne7 {Shielding g6. } 7. Nh4 {Inviting to fork the two pieces.} Nd5 {Black thinks he's smart, and plans to exchange the Rh8 for two pieces, with a great risk of having my Q trapped. } 8. Qh5+ {Accepting the challenge, but of course, I'm not going for the previous line. } g6 9. Nxg6 hxg6 {If now QxR, NxB, and white loses. } 10. Qxg6+ {But this saves my piece (I sacrificed a N for two pawns and black has a lot of developement difficulties, specially after...} Ke7 11. Bd2 {...this move. Note that if I play c4, the black N has to go to b6, allowing my B to check him in b4. After c5, dxc, the threats is still on. } f5 {Qg4+ only helps him to exchange some piece and improve his position. So...} 12. Ng5 {Threatening a nasty check on f7 or e6. } Rh6 {Defends from both, but I still have a haven for my Q. } 13. Qg8 {Now, Nc6 just doesn't work because it allows Qxd6+. } b6 {? Nf7, Nc6 and we have the exchanges he needs to balance the game. } 14. c4 {...Now this N has no place to go to.} Bb7 15. cxd5 {It allows black to defend d6, thoug. But I recovered my piece and, IF I can save my Q from being trapped, the game is almost won. Bb4 is still a strong threat. } Bxd5 16. Bb4+ c5 17. dxc5 {Gives him another tempo, but it is also opening the d column for my R. } bxc5 18. Bc3 {If Ba3, keeping the pressure on c5, Qa5+ would allow him to unravel his position. } Nf6 {Now he can play this, of course, since d6 is defended, but I still have...} 19. Qf7+ Kd6 20. O-O-O {...and now d6 is threatened again. Now, if something like Qe7, I can happily exchange my Q and  I'll be fine, though not winning. } Ng4 {Threatening Nxf2, forking my Rooks. I don't mind: it's time to attack.} 21. Bc4 {Nxf2, Bxd5, NxRd1, BxRa8+, winning. But I overlooked my free N on g4.} Qxg5+ 22. Bd2 {Q and R are threatened. Qg6 seems the only way to save the day for black, but even so, it was a tough position for black, who went wrong by playing...} f4 23. Bxf4+ {Black can still save himself by playing Ne5, and after BxQ, NxB, BxR, NxR, black will have a great edge, but the game was still playable. My opponent resigned here. In case he wouldn't, the game would have gone like this: } Ne5 24. Bxg5 Nxf7 25. Bf4+ Kc6 26. Bxd5+ exd5 27. Bxh6 Bxh6+ 28. Kb1 Rb8 29. Rhe1 Bg7 30. b3 {...it's still a playable game.} Nd6 {}
