1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {Bishop's opening.} Qf6 3. Qh5 {This isn't going to work, black is protecting Pf7.} g6 4. Qf3 {A queen exchange here works to black's advantage, doubling white's pawns.} Qxf3 5. Nxf3 {I completely retract my prior statement--the knight move is excellent.  White is well developed, while black just has two pawns out.} c6 {This move does nothing to protect Pe5 from NxPe5.} 6. Nxe5 d5 7. exd5 b5 {Bb3 protects Pd5.  Black's pawns are getting munched.} 8. Bd3 Bd7 9. O-O {Nothing protects Pd5.  I would have moved dxc6, or NxBd7, followed by dxc6.  Either way, however black retakes the pawn white is left with BxPb5, and gains another pawn.} cxd5 10. b3 {Oh no.  Re1 is a really good move here, because if black does not interpose white can play NxPg6+ (discovered check by the rook).  When black deals with that, NxRh8 for further advantage.  Black will respond to Pb3 with Bg7, and white's "a" rook will be threatened, or the white knight pinned.} Bd6 {White should play Nxd7, though Bb2 isn't terrible.} 11. Bb2 {B-)} f6 12. Nxd7 Nxd7 13. a4 bxa4 14. Rxa4 Ne7 15. Ra6 Nc8 16. Re1+ Be5 17. Nc3 d4 18. Nd5 Rb8 {Nothing protects Pd4 from Bxd4.  Be5 is pinned by Re1.} 19. Re6+ {I would have taken the d4 pawn instead.} Kf7 20. Re7+ {Oh no, Nc8 will eat that rook.} Nxe7 21. Bc4 {Down four points, all trades benefit black.} Nxd5 22. Bxd5+ Kg7 23. Bc6 Nc5 24. Ba3 Bd6 25. b4 Nb7 26. Bb2 Bxb4 27. Bxd4 Nd8 {Nothing is protecting Pd2.  Bxd2 seems like a decent move for black instead.  Black's h rook loses mobility with this retreat.} 28. Bd5 Bxd2 29. Re7+ Kh6 30. Re4 {RxPa7 would have been horrible.  BxPf6 would also be bad.  Why?  Because Rb1# ends this game in black's favor.  The king's castle door is broken.  Any rook will gut him.  Here, Rb1+, Re1, Rxe1#.} Nb7 {Whoa.  That was horrible.  Black blocks his own mating opportunity.} 31. Rh4+ Kg5 32. g3 Rhd8 33. f4+ Bxf4 34. gxf4+ {.} Kxh4 35. Bxf6+ Kh5 {Better would have been Kg4, giving black a pawn after the bishop/rook trade.} 36. Bf3+ Kh6 37. Bg5+ Kg7 38. Be4 {White should probably have traded--the rook is worth a couple of points more than the bishop.  Granted, two bishops can be a potent force, but so can two rooks--and black enjoys a powerful advantage.} Rd4 39. Bf3 Rc4 40. f5 gxf5 41. Bd1 Nc5 42. h4 Rb1 43. Kf2 Rxd1 44. Kf3 Rxc2 45. Kf4 Re1 {Rf1+ would have saved Pf5 from the white king.} 46. Kxf5 Rf2+ 47. Kg4 a5 {Black doesn't need another queen.  March the white king into the wall with the rooks:  Rg1+ 48. Kh3, Ne4.  White's moves are numbered.} 48. Kh5 Ne4 49. Bh6+ Kh8 50. Bg7+ {?  Why toss the bishop?} Kg8 {??  What was wrong with KxBg7?  White is unlikely to wriggle a stalemate out of this.} 51. Kh6 a4 52. h5 Ref1 53. Bd4 Rf2f6+ 54. Bxf6 Rxf6# {}
