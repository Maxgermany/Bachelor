O-O {White castles. But Black have several moves left before being able to castle.

No risk that Black is queening in the future. } Kxf5 {Now it is my King, Bishop and three pawns against my opponents King and Rook. Also my King is located perfect in the area of the queening squares. I will win, if I not blundering the game away.} 49. b4 Rd2+ 50. Kc6 Ra2 51. Kb5 Ke4 52. Bb6 {Locating my Bishop better and also gives space for my a-pawn to advance. ItÂ´s no hurry.} Ke5 53. c5 Kd5 54. c6 Rc2 55. Bc5 {Another nail in Blacks coffin.} Ke6 56. Kb6 Rg2 57. a5 Rg8 58. a6 {Black gives up. This was a fun game. Nice to win against a 1800+player also!}
