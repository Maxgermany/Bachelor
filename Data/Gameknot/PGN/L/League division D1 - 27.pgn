1. Nf3 {A non-committal opening which can lead almost anywhere.} Nf6 2. d4 g6 {I head for my favourite King's Indian Defence.} 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 {The standard position after White's move 6 in the Main Line.} e5 {Black is willing to accept the rather boring continuation 7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. Nxe5 Re8 but would prefer the more orthodox game continuation.} 7. d5 a5 {To prevent the Bayonet Attack and prepare ... Na6 and ... Nc5, attacking the e-pawn.} 8. O-O Na6 9. Re1 {Looks OK but prevents White's standard manoeuvre to bolster the centre of Ne1 followed by f3} Nc5 10. h3 {? Surprisingly allowing Black to take on e4.  I'm not sure whether this was an oversight or deliberate.} Ncxe4 11. Nxe4 Nxe4 12. Bd3 Nc5 13. Bb1 f5 {Black achieves his standard break with the added bonus that the e4 pawn is missing!} 14. Bg5 Bf6 15. Qd2 f4 {cutting off the B from his supporting Q} 16. h4 Bg4 {Usually Black can't play this because White has already played Ne1 and f3} 17. Bxf6 Qxf6 18. Ng5 h6 19. f3 hxg5 20. fxg4 {I don't usually go in for exchanging off both my bishops but this position merits it because of the pawn chain and the prosecution of the Kingside attack} gxh4 21. a3 {?? allows ... Nb3, forking Q and R} f3 {but first I threaten to fork K and Q with my f-pawn, encouraging gxf3, which will allow my Q to f3 and give me a passed h-pawn.} 22. Rf1 {pinning the pawn against the Queen} e4 {supporting the pawn.  Now the Nc5's attentions are divided....} 23. Bc2 {Finally preventing ... Nb3} a4 {making it possible again} 24. Rf2 {preparing to double on the f-file and also reinforcing g2 but creating an opportunity for a future fork on e3} Nb3 {Finally playing the fork} 25. Bxb3 axb3 26. Raf1 Qe5 {threatening another fork} 27. gxf3 h3 {threatening to play ...Qg3 , since blocking the check would allow the pawn to take.  ...exf3 after this } 28. Qe3 Qg3+ 29. Kh1 Rxf3 {! well - OK -... Rxf3} 30. Qd4 {White can't play Rxf3 because of Qg2#} Raf8 31. Qxe4 Rf8f6 {It would be a shame to allow White to take on g6 with a perpetual.} 32. Qe8+ Kh7 33. Qe7+ Kh6 34. g5+ Kxg5 35. Rg1 {The pin forces me to enter a swap of Q for 2 Rooks but strategically the position favours me.} Qxg1+ 36. Kxg1 Rf3xf2 37. Qe3+ Kg4 38. Qe4+ Kh5 {Now White can't check me.} 39. Qd3 h2+ 40. Kh1 Rf2f1+ 41. Kxh2 Rf6f2+ 42. Kg3 Rf2f3+ 43. Qxf3+ Rxf3+ 44. Kxf3 {I've allowed the big swap-off on the basis that my passed g-pawn will force White's King to stay Kingside while I dash over to the Queenside and snaffle White's pawns, allowing my advanced b-pawn to Queen} Kg5 45. Kg3 Kf5 46. Kf3 Ke5 47. Ke3 g5 48. a4 g4 49. a5 g3 50. Kf3 Kd4 {Now it's all over.} 51. Kxg3 Kxc4 {Greedy.  ... Kd3 was better, I think.} 52. Kf3 Kd3 53. Kf4 Kc2 54. Kf5 Kxb2 55. Ke6 Kc3 56. Kd7 b2 57. Kxc7 b1=Q 58. Kxd6 Qb4+ 59. Kd7 Qxa5 {Covering the queening square of White's remaining pawn.  Now my dormant b-pawn wins the game.} 60. d6 b5 61. Ke7 b4 62. d7 b3 63. d8=Q Qxd8+ {}
