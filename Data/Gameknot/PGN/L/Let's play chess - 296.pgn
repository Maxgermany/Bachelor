1. d4 {In this game I won a couple pawn and traded down into a won endgame.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bxc4 e6 {Standard to cut down my bishop's diagonal.} 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Qa4+ {Not great, this a trappy move where you hope he won't notice Nc6, I don't know what I was thinking with this.} Nc6 7. Bb5 {Pressuring the knight.} Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 Bd7 9. Ba3 {Much better than b2, this takes a long diagonal and prevents castling.} a6 10. Bxc6 bxc6 {? Better would be Bxc6.} 11. Nf3 c5 {Doesn't accomplish much.} 12. Qc4 Ne4 {? } 13. Bxc5 {Wins a pawn.} Nxc5 14. Qxc5 {White has a huge advantage, his queen is well centralized, he has a strong center and he is up a pawn.} Qe7 {?} 15. Qxc7 O-O 16. O-O {I finally castle. White has a near winning advantage.} Rac8 17. Qa5 Rca8 18. Ne5 Rfd8 19. Nxd7 {Simplifying. } Rxd7 20. Rfb1 {I think I should have moved the other rook.} Rd5 21. Qb4 Qxb4 {? I wouldn't have done this, it simplifies even more.} 22. Rxb4 Rc8 23. Rab1 {If he *really* wants to he can take my pawn...} h6 24. Rb4b8 {! Forces an exchange.} Rxb8 25. Rxb8+ Kh7 26. f4 {I now have a won game.} Ra5 27. Rb7 Rxa2 28. Rxf7 {Pawn trade, it does give him a passed pawn, but it gives him an isolated pawn and gets rid of one of my isolated pawns.} Ra3 29. Re7 Rxc3 30. Rxe6 {Another trade.} a5 31. Ra6 Rxe3 32. Rxa5 Re4 {Fork.} 33. Kf2 {? Better would have been g3.} Rxf4+ 34. Ke3 g5 35. g3 Rf1 36. d5 {Passed pawns must be pushed.} Re1+ 37. Kd4 Rh1 38. Ra2 g4 39. d6 Kg7 {Nothing he can do to stop it.} 40. Rd2 {If I had moved my pawn again then he could have skewered my king and pawn.} Ra1 41. d7 Ra8 42. Ke5 Rd8 43. Ke6 Kf8 44. Rf2+ Kg7 45. Ke7 Ra8 46. d8=Q Rxd8 47. Kxd8 {Now it won't be long.} Kg6 48. Ke7 Kg5 49. Rf6 h5 50. Kf7 h4 51. gxh4+ Kxh4 52. Rf4 {Pins his pawn.} Kh3 53. Kg6 {If he takes my pawn then it's just a simple matter of king and rook VS king. He resigns. Please comment and rate.}
