1. e4 {.Early on move 8, White lost a piece to a common Noah's ark trap, but still fought stubbornly until move 51... not much to tell about that either, just a bunch of forced exchanged pieces...} d5 2. e5 {Surprised me, white is trying to transpose in to a French defence} c5 {Postponing e6 for now and to make d4 more difficult} 3. Be2 {? } Nc6 {Pressure on that lonely pawn is the idea} 4. Nf3 Bg4 {Although white's queen is protected exchanging the bishop for the knight might give me a free pawn latter on, and the French defence bad bishop is developed and maybe even traded off } 5. O-O e6 {French defence without white's d4} 6. Bb5 {? instead of 3.Be2 was better, but why does white wants to trade his good bishop?} Nge7 {to keep a knight on c6 and pressure on e5} 7. d3 {opens the c1-h6 diagonal, but closes in the light squares bishop} a6 {forcing the exchange} 8. Ba4 {?? loses a bishop to a common trap the Noah's ark} b5 9. Bb3 c4 10. dxc4 dxc4 {and white's bishop is lost} 11. Bxc4 Qxd1 {As I will have an advantage of space and material, then the best course of play is to exchange pieces with a Zwischenzug I will exchange queens, the pin on Nf3 allows me to capture the e5 pawn also} 12. Rxd1 bxc4 13. Nbd2 {? attacks my c4 pawn, but closes his own bishop in c1} Nxe5 {As said before the e pawn falls also, Nf3 is pinned, the main threat is now Rd8 to pin Nd2, allowing some tactics such as: Bxf3 gxf3 Nxf3+ king moves Nxd2 to achieve further simplification of the position  } 14. Re1 {Removal of the pin} Nxf3+ 15. Nxf3 {? as it allows more exchanges which is good for black as it has an advantage, better is gxf3 and after Bf5 c3 is in order with some counter-play against the c4 pawn } Bxf3 {But exchanges are still possible} 16. gxf3 Nd5 {the idea is to control f4 but also threatens Nb4-c2} 17. c3 {defending against Nb4} Bd6 {Now f4 is controlled and threatens to have further exchanges, black must play Bg5 or Re4 to prevent it. Maybe Bg5 is better, as allows the plan Bh4-g3 and if black exchanges now white can restore some of his pawn structure} 18. Bd2 {? allows exchanging the bishop} Bf4 {again when in advantage exchange material is taken to the letter here} 19. Bxf4 Nxf4 20. Re4 Nd3 {and is a pawn for a pawn or if Rb1 then Rc8 protects c4} 21. Rxc4 Nxb2 22. Rg4 {inconsequent move, as the pawn is easily sacrificed to simplify further the position} Rb8 {Setting a trap to exchange rooks on the g column, if Rxg7? then Kf8! forces white's rook back on the g column and then Rg8 forces exchange, as the rook is under absolute pin. I'm expecting the sequence 23.Rxg7 Kf8 24.Rg4 Rg8 25.Rb1 Rxg4 26.fxg4 Rb6 with the idea Nc4 to remove the pin and threatening Rb2} 23. Rxg7 Kf8 {forcing the rook back on the same path, gaining a tempo to pin it latter, and defending the g8 to place my pinning rook} 24. Rg4 Rg8 {now the white's rook is pinned on the g column I can exchange rooks and the final is a matter of technic} 25. Rxg8+ Kxg8 26. Rb1 Rb6 {Both c4 and a4 lose the pawns to Nxc4 or Nxa4 as the the black rook will be defended} 27. Kf1 Na4 {forcing the decision capture or abandon the b column to black's rook} 28. Rc1 {defends the pawn but abandons the key square b2} Rb2 29. c4 Kf8 {I thought a lot about this move the alternative was Nc5 to block the pawn, but centralizing the king in the endgame is normally good} 30. c5 Ke7 31. c6 {these pawn moves were precipitated as allowed me to centralize my king without any danger of promotion, as both my knight had b6 to control the promotion square and my king had time to occupy c8 tying the rook to the defence of the pawn} Nb6 32. Rd1 Nd5 {blocking the d column} 33. a3 Rc2 {after other less good move by black the rook picks the lonely pawn} 34. a4 Rxc6 {some ideas of consolidation now arise, from the position, a5 followed by Nb4, the knight blocks the b column, the king and e6 pawn controls part of the d column and black's rook controls the c column, or Rc4 to control also the 4th rank and to force a5 or Ra1, followed by Nb4 to block the b column } 35. h3 Rc4 {Now white has to chose between Ra1 or a5, Ra1 leads to a5 blocking further advance by the a pawn then Nb6 will help picking it up, a5 leads to Ra5 will fall as well, strategically speaking then Black will have to place the rook behind the newly isolated a pawn and push it towards promotion to tie the rook to the defence of a1 and possibly to deflect the king toward the queen's wing to facilitate blacks king action on the king's wing, exchange that pawn and the rook for white's rook is the secondary objective.} 36. Ra1 a5 {keeping the plan to block the a pawn I expect a king move or h4, so Nb6 next will win the pawn, a possible sequence is 37.Ke1 (if 37.Ke2 then 37...Nc3+ 38.Kd3 Rxa4 39.Rxa4 Nxa4 40.Kc3 and 40...Nb6 creates a wall the black king can't cross a4-b4-c4 if 41.Kd4 Kd6 wins the oposition) 37...Nb6 38.Kd2 Rxa4...} 37. Ke2 {expected...} Nc3+ {wins the pawn with tempo} 38. Kd3 Rxa4 {now I capture white's a pawn offering the exchange of rooks, but white has better moves than to accept this, as if Rxa4 Nxa4 Kc4 Nb6 Kb5 a4 now the knight defends the a pawn and cannot be captured as white king would be off the square of promotion} 39. Re1 Nd5 {repositioning the knight to block the 5th rank and to allow Nf6 if needed to defend the h pawn} 40. Rb1 {white tries again to get his rook behind the black's pawns} Rb4 {again the rook is blocked and the a pawn can move one more square foreword, if Ra1 a4 then Rf4 with the idea of setting a trap a3 Rxa3 Rxf3+ to skewer the rook on a3} 41. Ra1 a4 {and slowly the a pawn gets near the promotion} 42. Ra3 {?? blunder allows the forced exchange with Rb3+ Rxb3 only move or loses the rook axb3 and now black controls both c2 (with the pawn) and c3 (the knight), so if Kc4 b2 promotes the pawn if Kd2 white needs three tempi to get to the pawn the same as black's king to defend it} Rb3+ {3} 43. Rxb3 {Forced} axb3 44. Kd2 Kd6 45. Kc1 Kc5 46. Kb2 {As early commented after the exchange of rooks the white king took 3 tempi to reach black's pawn...} Kb4 {... and black's king took the same amount of tempi to defend the same pawn, plus gained opposition, now my plan is to block white's remaining pawns and to win one tempo to break the opposition and promote the b pawn} 47. h4 h5 {the h pawn is blocked, now white has two choices advance the f pawns and lose other pawn or to move the king either way black will play Nf4 and wait...} 48. Kb1 Nf4 {all white's pawns are blocked...} 49. Kb2 f6 {losing one tempo to remove opposition, and then 50...Kc3 wins a position to support the promotion.  Black's approach on this game was to do massive exchanges after a material advantage achieved with a basic Noah's Ark trap, and then to push one the remaining pawns to promotion with no more "fireworks" than the ones necessary to force some exchanges.} 50. Kb1 Kc3 51. Kc1 b2+ {}
