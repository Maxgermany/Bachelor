1. d4 d5 2. c4 {My favorite opening - queen gambit} dxc4 {Even better, accepted!} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e4 e6 5. Bxc4 {There we go, regain the pawn with superior central development} Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O a6 8. a3 b5 9. Bb3 Bb7 10. h3 {Actually, I couldn't think of a really strong move here, so i prevent the knight from holding that pesky square} Nbd7 11. e5 Nd5 12. Nxd5 {I hate seeing his knight so well placed} exd5 13. Qd3 {I've got my eye on his h7 pawn} c5 14. Bc2 {hoping he would think i am just avoiding the Q-B fork, but actually i'm still scheming for the h7 pawn} f5 {Curses, he blocked it!} 15. exf6 e.p. {Now he's got to take with knight to continue protection on h7} Bxf6 {Ah, he missed that.  } 16. Qxh7+ Kf7 {Now with a bit of analysis I found a great mating combo which he fell into} 17. Bg6+ Ke7 18. Re1+ Kd6 19. Bf4+ Kc6 20. Re6# {Voila! Wasn't that pretty?}
