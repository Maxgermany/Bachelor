1. e4 {Sicilian Defense, Najdorf, Byrne-English Attack, B90} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e6 7. f3 b5 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. g4 Ne5 {?!  A major deviation from the normal lines, which are 9...h6 or 9...Nb6.  Perhaps my opponent saw somewhere that Black had scored well with this line, despite the few number of games played...but this move clearly gives White the initiative, and perhaps 14.f5 came as a surprise to Black...} 10. g5 Nfd7 11. f4 Nc4 12. Bxc4 bxc4 13. O-O-O Qc7 14. f5 Ne5 15. Rhf1 Rb8 16. Kb1 Qb7 {16...Bd7 17.fxe6 fxe6 18.Nf3 Qb7 19.b3 cxb3 20.axb3 Nc4 21.Qd3 Nxe3 22.Qxe3 a5 = } 17. b3 Be7 {17...cxb3 18.axb3 Qc7 or just 17...Qc7 is better.  By playing 17...Be7, Black subjugates himself to an immediate pawn fork and subsequent temporary residence on f6 for one of White's foot soldiers, which turns out to be a thorn in Black's side for the rest of the game...} 18. f6 gxf6 19. gxf6 cxb3 20. axb3 Nc4 {Black sees an opportunity to gain 2 Bishops vs. 2 Knights for the coming endgame...but before the endgame arises, the middle game still exists!} 21. Qe2 Nxe3 22. Qxe3 Bf8 23. e5 {!  Lending support to his mate on f6, but it appears that Black can close the center with his next move, 23...d5!} d5 24. Nxd5 {!!!  A Tal, Alekhine, Spielmann, and Nezhmetdinov-like sac!!!  I believe Spielmann might classify this as a vacating sacrifice, since the object of a vacating sacrifice is to clear a certain square for a certain piece (the e6 square for the pawn on e5--if Black takes the knight with the pawn on e6).  It could also be classified as a line-clearing sacrifice, since White chose to capture the Knight on d5 with his Queen, thereby keeping his pawn on e6.    The main points to note are the two White rooks and queen on the d, e, and f files (with no other pieces to obstruct the White rooks from moving freely along his first rank), the advanced pawn on f6, the advanced pawn on e5 ready to move on to e6 if given an opportunity, the unobstructed mobility of the queen, and the knight on d4, which can quickly penetrate into Black's position.  Black's king in the center is always a huge red flag, especially since both Black bishops are still on their original squares!} Qxd5 {24...exd5 is better, but still not good enough!  One line runs 24...exd5 25.e6 Bd6 26.exf7+ Kxf7 27.Rg1 Rg8 28.Rxg8 Kxg8 29.Qe8+ Bf8 30.Rg1+ Bg4 31.Rxg4+ Kh8 32.f7! and Black will soon be mated...} 25. Nf5 Qb5 26. Ng7+ Bxg7 27. fxg7 Rg8 28. Rxf7 {!!!  Spielmann would classify this sacrifice as a king's hunt sacrifice.  If 28...Kxf7 then 29.Qf3+ Ke7 (29...Ke8 30.Qh5+ Ke7 31.Qg5+ Ke8 32.Rd8+ Kf7 33.Qf6 mate, or 29...Kg6 30.Rg1+ Kh6 31.Qh3 mate) 30.Qf6+ Ke8 31.Rd8 mate!} Bd7 29. Qf2 {Now White infiltrates on his next move with another heavy piece to Black's 2nd rank and the rest of the moves are pretty much forced...} Kd8 30. Qa7 Rb7 31. Qa8+ Kc7 32. Rfxd7+ Qxd7 33. Rxd7+ Kxd7 34. Qxb7+ Ke8 35. Qc8+ Kf7 36. Qd7+ Kg6 37. Qxe6+ Kg5 38. Qxg8 Kg6 39. Qf8 h6 40. g8=Q+ Kh5 41. Qf3+ Kh4 42. Qgg4# {}
