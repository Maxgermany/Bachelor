[Opening "Queen's pawn (A46), Torre attack"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Be3 {More usual would be c4, grabbing a mini pawn centre, however this move does continue development despite looking slightly cramped.} g6 {Black continues the main line of the kings indian planning to bring the bishop to g7 giving the king a large amount of protection when castled.} 4. Nc3 {Continues development, again I would play c4, and plan perhaps to set up an assault on the queenside.} Bg7 5. Bg5 {A second move for the bishop, against opening principles, although it moves the bishop to a more natural square, and frees whites position.} O-O {White is now set up to push the e-pawn to get the pawn centre, black could have prevented this with a pre-emptive d5. However one of the tactics of the kings indian defence is to encourage white to over expand, then counter-attack the over stretched pieces. For this reason black castles to safety, and can now think about developing the queenside.} 6. e4 {Grabs the pawn centre} d6 {Doesn't assult the centre yet, black decides to bide his time and let white over commit. This move releases the bishop to d7, however I feel b6 to fianchetto the bishop to b7, or c6 to support the d-pawn in an advance to d5, would have been better. Nothing wrong with the played move though.} 7. Bd3 h6 {Played to unbreak the pin on the knight. White can either retreat or capture the knight. My instinct would be to retreat, as I value the bishop over the knight, and I see no precise tactic to win material or position by taking the knight. Also I feel black has weakened his king by playing the move, and the pawn structure in front of the black king is already weak from the early fianchetto, white could take advantage of this by keeping the bishop attacking the now weak h-pawn.} 8. Bxf6 {But white captures the knight, possibly he considers himself to be more developed than black, so can start thinking of a kingside assault, however losing the black square bishop isn't a good way to start this kind of attack.} Bxf6 9. O-O e5 {Black finally attacks the centre, and releases his white squared bishop, however he has to be careful, as generally the more developed player benefits from open lines.} 10. d5 {However he needn't worry as white chooses to close the centre. This choice would be more logical if white had a pawn standing on c4, to protect the d-pawn, however as he doesn't the overextended pawn may become a weakness} Nd7 {Black now looks to take advantage of the overstretched white centre, by threatening to move his knight into c5, a strong outpost for the knight, and if not then the knight is well positioned to swing over to the kingside to support an attack or defend.} 11. Qd2 {Attacks the weak h6 pawn} Bg7 {Defends the pawn, this is better than moving the king forward as now the knight has a square to move to on the kingside} 12. g3 {A surprising move, and one that fundamentally weakens the king, with no apparent advantage to doing so as white cannot put a bishop on g2. It could be to give the knight a square to retreat to if white plays Nh4, however again there is no advantage to playing this.} Nf6 {Black continues to organise his forces, and his position, though initially weaker now looks to be stronger. 1) Whites centre pawns are overextended, and c6 would be problematic 2) The pawn structure in front of both kings is weak, however black is stronger as he has more pieces to defend it and no obvious way in. White however has a major white square weakness, and will need to be careful 3) Whites bishop is blocked in, and has little mobility, blacks c8 bishop looks far more active, and can easily move to attack the white position} 13. h4 {It now looks like white hopes for a kingside attack, and wants to open blacks kingside with pawn exchanges. This is a big mistake, and will lead to his downfall, black will now use the weak white squares to attack whites king before white gets any chance to lead an attack} Bg4 {Attacking the undefended knight. Also playable is Bh3, moving in behind the advanced pawns} 14. Nh2 Qd7 15. Bb5 c6 16. Nxg4 {White decides to trade his out of position knight for the well positioned bishop, and following the forced recapture by the knight (16...Qxg4 17. dxc6 bxc6 18. Bxc6 wins a pawn), white can move the bishop away from the attack of the pawn with a tempo, attacking the well placed knight.} Nxg4 17. Be2 Nf6 {Moving the knight to a good position to oversee any battle for the centre with the pawns. Also with whites exposed kingside black won't want his knight being traded off for the bishop, as less material reduces the chance of a successful attack.} 18. f4 {White continues to expand on the kingside. This is a move i would hardly even consider, with such an open king white would be better to plan an escape route with possibly 18. Rfe8 allowing the bishop to move to f1-g2 and allowing the king to run across the back line in case black moves in behind the over extended pawns} Qh3 {A penetrating move by black, and whites position is starting to look very shaky. This could have been averted by the rook move as Bf1 drives away the queen.} 19. Qe3 {Defending the g3 pawn} Rfe8 {A surprising slow move from black, I think 19...Nh5 opens a number of threats 1) 20. Nxg3, followed by a possible Qh1 causing some major problems 2) 20. exf4 Rxf4 (if gxf4 Qxe3) winning the exchange 3) 20. Qxg3 winning the pawn} 20. f5 {Better would have been Rad1, looking to counter attack the centre against the flank attack. This pawn push however leaves white with a weak backward pawn on e4, which will prove costly.} cxd5 {The first of the exchanges, the backward e-pawn has to defend both d and f pawns which is impossible.} 21. exd5 {taking the pawn back but leaving the f-pawn undefended. Better would have been fxg6 hoping to make the position rather messy and difficult to calculate, the played move is very easy to play against.} gxf5 {Wins the pawn, and threatens f4 winning another pawn.} 22. Nb5 {A careless move, white gets distracted and attacks the queenside, overlooking the much greater threat to his kingside. A simple reatreat of the queen to f2 may have given him a fighting chance of defending.} f4 {The pawn cannot take the f-pawn as white will lose his queen, and black is now able to push the pawn through to g3 helping the queen set up checkmate threats.} 23. Qf3 fxg3 {Black threatens the immediate Qh2#} 24. Qg2 {Defending the threat} Qxh4 {Picking up an extra pawn, and keeps the queen lurking near the king. My instinct would be to trade queens and force a winning endgame, however black hopes for a checkmate before the endgame.} 25. Nc7 {Winning the exchange, but leaving his king very vulnerable, black won't mind losing the exchange as he now has good winning chances.} Qd4+ 26. Kh1 Ne4 {A good plan, bringing in more pieces instead of just checking and moving the king around. The threat is Nf2 , setting up a discovered check} 27. Nxe8 {Unable to block the threat white grabs the material, however it looks very bad for white even if he survives the coming attack black has passed pawns on the e and h files, so white will certainly lose an endgame.} Nf2+ 28. Kg1 Rxe8 {Another slow move from black, although he's still winning easily. Better would have been 28...Nh3  29. Kh1 Qh4, setting up a discovered check that will result in white losing his queen or being checkmated.} 29. c3 {A final weak move from white, possible is Qf3, preventing the previously mentioned combination, but probably losing the exchange.} Nh3+ {Black plays the combination on the second chance} 30. Kh1 Qh4 31. Qf3 {Another blunder giving black an easy checkmate, but anything else allows Nf4  winning the queen and inevitably the game.} Nf2+ 32. Kg2 Qh2# {A good finish, black didn't prolong the suffering prefering a quick decapitation. Always the best way as messing around to win material can lead to a downfall.
