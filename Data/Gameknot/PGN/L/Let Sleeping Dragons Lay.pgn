1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. f3 {?! Most modern books on the Benoni do not even cover this move and for good reason. It is way to slow! The appeal of this move is that white essentially shuts the door on tactics for the time being. Holding true the Stientz altruism, "It is better to keep your enemy at arms length until you have finished developing." Well he did not say that exactly. } Bg7 8. Nge2 {Another rare move. Sometimes this knight will end up on c4 via g3-f1-d2-c4. Quite a tour if you ask me. The other option(which you will see in this game) is the knight supporting the rare f4-f5 break. Opp! did I just give up too much.  Alternative variation: [Mostly played is ] 8. Bg5 O-O 9. Qd2 Bd7 [⩱] } O-O 9. Ng3 a6 {A very good idea! Black who has all the time in the world can flick in ...b7-b5 whenever he feels like it.  Alternative variation: 9... Nh5 [!?] 10. Nxh5 gxh5 11. Bd3 Nd7 [ has turned out well for black in practice] } 10. a4 {preventing b7-b5 for the time being.  } h5 {A standard move aimed at harassing the knight on g3.  Alternative variation: 10... Nbd7 [!?] 11. Be2 [ and now black has a choice of no less than 5 moves. 11...h5; Re8; Ne8 and Rb8. All of which are relatively unexplored. ] } 11. Be2 {Developing and making way for a possible Nf1-Ne3-Nc4 } Re8 {? Here black should be thinking to playing for f7-f5. In that case the rook sits better on the F-file. Later in the game this move will come back to bite black in the butt.  Alternative variation: 11... Nh7 [!?] 12. Be3 Nd7 13. O-O h4 14. Nh1 f5 [⩱] } 12. O-O Nbd7 13. Bg5 {creating an annoyance for black but this should be very easy for black to handle. This move along with it's Bf4 cousin are easy victims for the benoni player.  } Qc7 {?! and this is not it.  Alternative variation: 13... Qb6 14. Qd2 Nh7 [⩱][ has scored very well for black in 2500+ play] Alternative variation: 13... Nf8 14. Qd2 N8h7 15. Bh6 Bh8 [⩲]  } 14. Qd2 {I want to play f4 } Nh7 {There are 4 games in my database from this position and white has won them all. } 15. Bh6 Bxh6 {? black should never give up his DSB so easily.  Alternative variation: 15... Bh8 [has not been explored. ] Alternative variation: 15... Bd4+ 16. Be3 Bg7 17. a5 b5 18. axb6 Qxb6 19. Rfb1 f5 [⩲] } 16. Qxh6 Ne5 {?? It was this move that sparked me to start a defending 101 thread in our club forms. All to often mistakes come in pairs. I am sure black thought white can not play f4 but he was wrong. At first I was quite disappointed with black's choice. However, the more I thought about it I was being too harsh on black as the correct 16....Qd8!? is not easy to spot.  Alternative variation: 16... Qd8 17. f4 Qf6 18. e5 Qg7 [⩲] } 17. f4 {! All of the sudden the white dragon has awoken from his slumber! } Ng4 18. Bxg4 Bxg4 19. f5 {! Now the small positional error of 11...Re8 comes back to haunt him. Truth be told black has been conditioned to expect white's attack to come through e4-e5. However, the king's knight is on g3 not f3!  } gxf5 20. h3 {and now the error 16...Ne5? comes to bare fruit. The bishop is pinned. When playing the benoni such deep tactical combinations must be thought out. The idea of 16...Qd8 is to swing the queen over to g7 where it can be exchanged for the white one with little disruption to the king pawns.  } Bxh3 21. gxh3 {Everything exists for the powerful attack. #1 piece majority #2 space advantage #3 open lines. } fxe4 22. Ncxe4 Re5 23. Nf5 f6 24. Nxf6+ Nxf6 25. Qg6+ {It is mate in six } Kh8 26. Qxf6+ Kh7 27. Qh6+ {? Alternative variation: 27. Kh1 Rg8 28. Rg1 Rxg1+ 29. Rxg1 Qg7 30. Qxg7# } Kg8 28. Kh1 Qh7 29. Rfg1+ Kh8 30. Qf6+ Qg7 31. Qxg7# {}
