[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {This game featured one of the most complicated tactical melees I've ever been involved in. For about 5 moves on each side, momentum seemed to swing back and forth with every move.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Bg4 {It starts right away. A very aggressive variation of the Philidor.} 4. Be2 c6 5. dxe5 Bxf3 6. Bxf3 dxe5 {I open the Queen file, allowing the exchange of Queens and preventing myself from castling. But the game doesn't get any simpler.} 7. Qxd8+ Kxd8 8. O-O Kc7 {I get my King away from the open Queen file.} 9. Bg4 Nf6 10. Bh3 Na6 {I'm attempting to get my pieces off the back line quickly and connect my Rooks.} 11. Nd2 Bc5 12. Nc4 {My King's movements are becoming restricted. Defense will be a high priority.} Rad8 {I take the open file -- so my opponent can't launch a killing attack along it.} 13. Nxe5 {White is up a Pawn. If he can get his Queen Bishop active and connect his Rooks, an attack could form up in a hurry.} Rhf8 {I can't afford to lose a second Pawn.} 14. Bf4 {Discovered check looms.} Kb6 {To avoid the discovery, I must go forward. Now my King is exposed.} 15. Nc4+ Kb5 {The King-hunt is on. I'll need all my defensive skills to survive.} 16. b3 {Guards the Knight and cuts off a flight square. If the Queen Bishop can reach d2, my King will be in a stalemate position.} Nxe4 {Regains the Pawn and targets d2.} 17. a4+ Kb4 {Now a Bishop check at d2 would mean mate.} 18. Bf5 {Attacking one of the pieces preventing Bd2 mate.} Rfe8 {Riposte.} 19. Rad1 {If I let White exchange Rooks, I'll lose my Knight.} b5 {Now it would be an even exchange.} 20. Ne5 {Out of danger, but...} Bxf2+ {I have to counterattack. Whoever comes out of the melee ahead will win.} 21. Kh1 {White could have traded a Rook and Pawn for a Knight and Bishop. He rejects the offer.} Rxd1 22. Rxd1 {Now that I'm up a Pawn, I figure I can win an endgame so I trade a pair of Rooks.} Nc3 23. Nxc6+ {Material is again even...} Kc5 24. Bd7 {Guarding the Knight... still anyone's game.} Re4 {Now with the attack on the Bishop, I don't give him time to move his Rook out of the line of fire.} 25. Bg3 {This allows me to win a Rook and essentially decides the game.} Bxg3 26. hxg3 Nxd1 {The compiications are over... I ended up ahead. This would be a good time for White to resign.} 27. Bc8 Nb4 28. Ba6 Nxa6 {This ends any remaining drama. The difference between my opponent and Inspector Javert is that Inspector Javert knew when to quit.} 29. axb5 Kxb5 30. Nxa7+ Kb4 31. Nc6+ Kc3 32. Na5 Kxc2 33. Nc4 Re6 34. Na3+ Kxb3 35. Nb1 Nc3 36. Nd2+ Kc2 37. Nf3 Ne2 {My Knight cuts off the King's flight square at g1...} 38. Ne1+ Kb3 39. Nf3 Rh6+ 40. Nh4 g5 41. g4 Rxh4# {...and mate follows.}
