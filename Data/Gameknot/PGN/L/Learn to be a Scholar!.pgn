1. e4 {My favorite move because the pawn moves two spaces. Why does white go first and black second? Is chess racist?} d5 {Attacking my pawn.} 2. exd5 {Why not capture?} Qxd5 {Black is clearly winning now because he controls all of the center and is more developed.} 3. Nc3 {The game is now equal because we are both developed with one piece.} Qd8 {White now has forced checkmate coming up soon because he is better.} 4. Bc4 {I have now developed my bishop.} Bd7 {This move is good for the bishop because it gives him more spaces to go.} 5. Nf3 {My second pony has joined the battle} Bg4 {This bishop wastes time and makes white better because it now has less spaces to go and because white has forced checkmate with Ne5 Bxd1 Bxf7#. That is what would have happened if I let my opponent fall into that trap but I didn't.} 6. h3 {The bishop needs to move from that square if it wants a future.} Bxf3 {White is still better even though he is down a pony and black's bishop can go to more places.} 7. Qxf3 {White will now win because he has 15 points of development and black has 0.} f6 {Adding one to black's development and defending against checkmate.} 8. Qxb7 {What is the air speed velocity of an unlaiden swallow?} Nd7 {The happy pony can now run to the center where he can have fun.} 9. Qd5 {This move blocks the path to happiness.} Rb8 {Rb8 moving the rook to the right (or his left)} 10. Qf7# {The much delayed scholar's mate! I hope that this instructed game has made you a scholar too}
