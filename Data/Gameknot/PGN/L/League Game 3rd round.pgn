1. e4 {Don't look at this game if you expect spectacular moves or sacrifices. This is one of my real league games with a 3h time control. It is not an example of an excellent game of mine but one can learn from it. I have annotated the critical parts with questions to the reader so one might make guesses for better moves. } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {A standard spanish Ruy Lopez opening.} 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Bg4 6. d3 Nf6 7. c4 Bc5 {The first little excitement approaches ...} 8. Be3 {I attack the unprotected bishop. If the opponent tries to trade I can free a file for my rook, but get a double pawn.} Bxe3 {And that is what happened.} 9. fxe3 Bxf3 {My opponent keeps me under pressure ...} 10. Rxf3 {I am desparately waiting to develop my knight ...} Qd6 {I recognize the danger of O-O-O and think hard what to do to fortify my D3 pawn! I conclude that I have to get the rook in place.} 11. Rf2 {Big mistake. The opponent has a GOOD move that would cost me pawn and lots of advantage ... Can you find the move for black? } O-O-O {Nxe4!! ... but luckily my opponent did not see the move.} 12. Rd2 {This compenstates for the mistake. } Qc5 {The opponent mounts more pressure attacking e3.} 13. Qe2 {The queen to the rescue ... and no way to bring my knight into the game ...} h5 {The opponent treatens a double attack on ...} 14. Nc3 {... e3 ... I decide to allow the attack to find a way to FINALLY develop my knight and prepare to defend e3.} Rd6 {The opponent readies another doble attack threat ... but makes a mistake. Can you see it?} 15. a3 {I prepare an attack on the queen ...} Ng4 {and here the long expected e3 attack.} 16. Re1 a5 {I did not find the motivation behind this move but it gives me time for a good attack on the opponent ... Can you guess my next move?} 17. Na4 {... the queen must retreat to a7.} Qa7 {What will follow is another good move ...} 18. c5 {This cuts off the queen and neutralizes the e3 treat.} Rf6 19. d4 {Ok, lets increase the pressure and lock the position.} Rd8 {This is a mistake of the opponent. What should he have done to keep up?} 20. h3 {The computer suggests Rf2 ... Now I fail to see a good move. ... What should I have done instead of h3?} Rf2 {dxe4 would have been much better:  2.10 20. dxe5 Re6 21. Rxd8  Kxd8 22. h3 Nxe5 23. Rd1  Kc8 24. Qxh5 b5 25. cxb6 cxb6 26. Qe2 f6 27. Qc2 Qc7 28. h4 } 21. Qd3 {Pretty much equal Qd1 or d3.} Rxd2 {No surprises here ...} 22. Qxd2 Nf6 23. Nc3 {This is another big mistake ... can you see the DARING attack that my opponent could use to trade equal pieces and improve his position? } b5 {Qxc5!! I should have played something like Qf2 instead.  } 24. b4 {Luckily my opponent makes an even worse move that brings me from a -1 to a  1.8 position rating. But I still don't see dxe5 as good and loose much of my advantage again with this move.} axb4 {The following moves are played as good as they get according to the analysis ...} 25. axb4 Qa3 {Well played opponent ... that should be ok, but I } 26. Rb1 Kb7 {This move is not optimal, but acceptable, istead I should have moved the King out of the potential check line.} 27. d5 cxd5 {This is a bad move for my opponent ... see why ...} 28. exd5 Nxd5 29. Nxd5 c6 {What would be the best move in this situation ... ?} 30. Qb2 {Definitely not this one!! I give away all my advantage and screw up my position. I drop from  2.2 to -1.2 that is a BIG mistake. Can you find a better move? } Qxb2 {Solution: e4 to protect the knight. Sounds so simple ...} 31. Rxb2 Rxd5 32. Rf2 {Well the damage was done and from here it is a downhill battle to the bitter end without comments ... Probably one or the other move could be better but the game was lost here.} Rd1+ 33. Kh2 f6 34. Rf5 Rb1 35. Rxh5 Rxb4 36. Rh7 Rc4 37. Rxg7+ Kc8 38. h4 Rxh4+ 39. Kg3 Rh5 40. Rf7 Rg5+ 41. Kf3 b4 {Leichter Fehler des Gegners: sollte Rf5   } 42. Rxf6 Kb7 43. Rd6 e4+ {Fehler!!! Friss den Bauern!  } 44. Kf2 Rxc5 45. Rd4 Rb5 46. g4 b3 47. Rd1 c5 48. g5 c4 49. g6 b2 50. Rb1 c3 51. g7 Rg5 52. Rg1 Rxg1 53. Kxg1 b1=Q+ 54. Kf2 Qa2+ {White resigns.}
