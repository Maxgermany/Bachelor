1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Nf3 b6 {One of my favorite openings.} 5. Bg5 {I prefer this opening, as it is more give more intersting play. Also there are some variations where black gets into good positions} Bb7 6. e3 h6 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 Ne4 9. Qc2 f5 {This opening was popular in the eighties I believe. To be honest, I like the position, but I dont know it that well. I like the control black has over the e4 square.} 10. a3 Bxc3+ 11. bxc3 d6 12. h3 {White loses too much time, however the position is closed, so black cannot profit quickly.} Nd7 {Aiming to break open the center with c5 or e5.} 13. a4 {Nice move, now c5 can be countered with a5, weakening blacks b6 pawn. } a5 {Trying to prevent weakening b6, but now c5 does not look very apetiizng anymore, since it would leave b6 weak.} 14. Nd2 {Maybe black should have played Nxg3 here, hoping for a strong field on e4. Unfortunately it is the Knight that should go there, so trading the Knight defeats seems wrong at the same time.} Ndf6 {White slow response means black has a hold on square e4.} 15. Bh2 {Well, Nxg3 is out of the window now} Nxd2 16. Qxd2 Qe7 {Only now did I realise that Ne4 is barely usefull. My plan was Ne4 and Qf6, but it is impossible because of f3 and the Knight has no escape.} 17. f3 O-O-O 18. Bd3 Kb8 {Preparing for an e5 breakthrough. White kings looks a little frail in the cente, but he will find no safety on either side of the board. If white had played e4 here, I would have countered e5, using the fact that his King is not safe on e1.} 19. Qc2 Nd7 {Preparing for e5. If white had played e4 I would have countered with f4, followed by e5. Also if white tried d4-d5, it leaves the field c5 open for blacks Knight.} 20. Rb1 {Probably castling queen side 0-0-0 would have been better. The kings side is not safe enough for white Hing.} Ka7 21. e4 f4 {White his center is not a strong as it may seem. And since white must now castle kingside, black is moving on the kings die already. Also black will soon attack the centre with e5 or d5, perhaps even c5.} 22. O-O h5 {Danger Robinsons!} 23. Be2 Qg7 24. Kh1 Rdg8 25. Rfg1 {It is clear white is in trouble, but this moves just cramps up his kings position.} Qh7 26. Bd3 e5 {As a preparation for g4. Black has a superior position, and the initiative. White has very few ways to open up on the other side of the board himself.} 27. g3 {White has little choice but to try and do somehting before he is being overrun. Not a bad move actually.} Nf6 28. dxe5 {There a resome clear positional disadvantages to exchanging the pawn. As will become clear in the rest of the game.} dxe5 29. gxf4 {I did not expect this} exf4 {A strong move, taking advantage of the fact that e4-e5 is not possible. After e5, Bxf3+, Re2, Qd7, exf6, g5-g4! white is in serious trouble.  Black move gives him a considerable positional advantage. Both e5 and c5 great positions for his Knight, and the thread g4 is still present.} 30. Rbe1 {If black can occupy e5 with his knight he will have a superior position.} Qd7 {Black has a superior position. He now abandons immediate tactics, and aims to put his pieces at better positions.} 31. Bf1 Qe6 {Now if I can get the Knight to e5 or c5, things are looking great. White does have a counter with c4-c5 though.} 32. Bg2 Nd7 33. Red1 Nc5 {This move seems stronger then the obvious Ne5. From here the Knight blocks c5, and aims at both a4 and e4. The plan is still to break through with g5-g4.  Black can easily wins a few pawns, but I am in no hurry. I considered it a winning position already.} 34. Rd2 Bc6 {Putting even more pressure, and bringing the Bisshop more into play. White may have to play Ra1, moving his rook away from the zone of the most imminent danger.  As a side effect, Rg1-d1 is now not practical because of Bxa4, winning the exchange. However I would not take the exchange, considering my Knight and Bisshop are more valuable in this position than the white rook.} 35. Ra1 g4 {Here we go, the time is right. Black cannot answer Bxf4 because gxf3 would finish him off.} 36. h4 g3 37. Bg1 Qe7 {Simple and effective} 38. Bxc5 Qxh4+ {Stronger than Qxc5.} 39. Kg1 Qh2+ 40. Kf1 bxc5 {Nothing can stop the march of black's h-pawn now. Meanwhile black's kingside is secure, since white does not have time enough launch an attack there. } 41. Rb1 h4 42. Qb2 h3 43. Qa3 {Last attempt, but c5 is secure since black Queen will make it to the diagonal g1-c5. } hxg2+ {Game over, well almost...} 44. Rxg2 Qh1+ 45. Rg1 Qxf3+ {White surrendered, after Ke1, Qe3, Kd1, Qxg1 his last hope against blacks king is gone, since c5 is safe.}
