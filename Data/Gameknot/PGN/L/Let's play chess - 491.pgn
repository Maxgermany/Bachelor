[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), classical variation"]

1. b3 {Nimzowitsch-Larsen attack. It's rare but I do see it occasionally} d5 {I don't like 1...e5 simply because I feel that it's best to not put a pawn in the line of fire so early after 2. Bb2} 2. Ba3 {?! This move caught me off-guard a little. Why bring the Bishop out to a3? It's an awkward place for it. 2. Bb2 is better.} Nf6 {Not really taking much thought into his move. I develop normally} 3. g3 {Looking to fianchetto the other bishop? Or bring it to h3 perhaps? Perhaps too extreme of a hypermodern opening, especially playing as White} g6 {I feel obligated to open up g7 for the Bishop because it will make some nasty discovered attacks, should White not close the diagonal. This is why the Bishop is better on b2.} 4. Bh3 {?! Bringing the other bishop out to h3?  Might as well go to g2.} Bxh3 5. Nxh3 {"Knights on the rim are dim." The knight will do far less good on h3 than on f3,} Bg7 6. Bb2 {Admitting that his 2nd move was a waste. } O-O 7. O-O {Black already has a slight edge due to the weaknesses of the light squares on the kingside. So, like any good general, let's go directly for it} Nc6 {But first, I must develop my final minor piece} 8. a3 {Another move that I did not quite understand. White needs to stake some claim in the center.} e5 {Black happily takes the other half of the center. This is exactly a position I'd like to be in. My position is flexible enough to do anything} 9. e3 Qd7 {Starting to shift toward the light squares on the Kingside. } 10. Kg2 {White's king steps up to protect the Knight and the light squares around him. However, This is a job a bishop should do!} Rfe8 11. f4 {?! Another dubious move. White's position will slowly deteriorate into a positional nightmare} e4 {Clamping down the center and grabbing more stake in the light squares on the Kingside} 12. Bxf6 {Now he gives up the long diagonal!} Bxf6 13. c3 {? Better was 13. Nc3} Nb8 {I spy with my little eye...an outpost on d3!} 14. Rf2 Na6 {planning 15...Nc5, then 16...Nd3} 15. b4 {Stopping the knight from jumping to d3, at least for the time being...} c5 {Black thrusts the pawn forward and challenges the b-pawn.} 16. Qf1 {? White is better off striking with 16. f5!? but Black will still be fine after 16... Bg7 17. Ra2 gxf5} cxb4 17. axb4 Nxb4 {Utilizing the pin on the pawn at c3.} 18. Na3 {18. cxb4? Bxa1} Nd3 {Black's knight makes its triumphant entrance at d3. Where it will cripple the enemy camp} 19. Re2 Qg4 {Adding more pressure, but perhaps this move is not necessary} 20. Nb5 Qd7 {Setting another trap.} 21. Rb1 {21. Rxa7? Rxa7 22. Nxa7 b6 23. Qa1 Ra8 snares the knight. Same goes with 21. Nxa7 b6} a6 {The knight could become annoying on b5 so let's give it a boot!} 22. Nd4 Bxd4 23. cxd4 {?! 23. exd4 is the right capture. After this move, Black has 2 passed pawns and a open c-file. } Rec8 {Pouncing on the file.} 24. Nf2 {The knight on h3 finally moves and threatens the knight on d3.} Nxf2 {The knight's work is done. I switch strategies to capitalizing on the open file. } 25. Qxf2 Rc2 {Rooks are always strongest on the 2nd file. And now the other rook is ready to join his fellow comrade...} 26. Ree1 Rac8 {Black asserts complete domination of the c-file. Now I just need to get those 2 passed pawns to start moving} 27. Qe2 Kg7 {But perhaps this is too defensive? White is not threatening anything any time soon.} 28. Red1 b5 {Passed Pawns must be pushed! } 29. h3 h5 {Ready to stifle any hopes of a possible g4} 30. g4 {He pushes it anyway!} h4 {This move now takes control of g3 and slightly safens the Black King because it takes the h-pawn out of the game.} 31. Kf2 Rc8c4 {Using the other rook to aid the passed pawns in their quest for glory!} 32. Ke1 Qc7 {Triple threat! Black is ready to charge with 33... Rc1.} 33. Qf2 {White's queen provides a distraction} Qd8 {Unfortunately, Black's Queen must protect the lonely pawn.} 34. Ke2 {34. g5 is met by 34...Qh8 with an eventual ...Qh5} b4 35. Qe1 {White must only await events} a5 {Black's pawns are now inching closer to their shining moment} 36. Rdc1 {Finally rebelling against the enemy rooks. } Qc7 {Capturing on c1 would only help White. It is best to keep the tension} 37. Rxc2 Rxc2 {The trade of rooks has helped White, but Black is still in control} 38. Qxh4 {White is loose! He certainly can open some lines to the Black king and he has brought the material back to even... However, this loses!} Qc3 {? A mistake in response! This brings up unnecessary complications! 38... Qc4+! would've been much simpler. 39. Kd1 Qa2 and White must lose the rook or give up mate. An example of mate would be 40. Rc1?? Rxd2+ 41. Ke1 Rh2! and Black will mate by 42...Qe2# or 42...Rh1#  The other alternative is to lose the pawn on d2 with 39. Kf2 Rxh2+ 40. Kg1 Qc2 but that doesn't look so great either. } 39. Qe1 {?? Better is 39. Rd1, forcing Black to have to find 39... Qc4+! again.After 40. Kf2, 40...Rc1 will win.} Qd3+ {Fully seizing the opportunity.} 40. Kd1 Rxd2+ 41. Qxd2 Qxb1+ 42. Ke2 Qh1 {? You can argue the fact that I made this harder than it had to be, that I could probably push the pawns to victory. You'd be right.} 43. g5 Qg2+ {?! You could also say that I made a Easily winning Queen ending into a difficult winning King and pawn ending. And you'd be right. However, I found the plan to win a long time ago and I always feel safer with the queens off the board.} 44. Kd1 Qxd2+ 45. Kxd2 a4 {Black must push the pawns first.} 46. Kc2 Kf8 {Get the King out into the open} 47. h4 {?? this makes things much easier for White. Much more difficult would've been to shuffle the king back and forth. like so: 47. Kb2 Ke7 48. Kc2 Kd6 49. Kb2 Kc6 50. Kc2 a3! (forcing the king to step forward) 51. Kb3 (51. h4 Kd6 and the King will stop the breakthrough in time.) 51... Kb5 (puts White in Zugzwang. The king must Step back and let the Black King in. 52. h4? is too slow.52...Kc6 53. h5 gxh5 54. f5 Kd6 55. g6 fxg6 56. fxg6 Ke6 and the king stops the pawn in time.) 52. Kc2 Kc4 53. h4 (This pawn break will succeed if Black doesn't get his pawns queened in time because he is a move farther away now.) 53...b3+ 54. Kb1 Kc3 55. h5 a2+ will win.} Ke7 {ready for 48...Ke6, 49...Kf5 50... Kg4 snaring the h-pawn and eventually, the whole chain of pawns} 48. f5 Kd6 49. fxg6 fxg6 50. h5 {Too slow} gxh5 51. g6 Ke6 52. g7 Kf7 53. g8=Q+ Kxg8 {Black has no troubles now} 54. Kb2 h4 55. Kc2 {White resigns}
