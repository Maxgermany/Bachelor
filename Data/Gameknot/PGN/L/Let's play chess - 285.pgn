1. e4 {Common opening move for White.} e5 {Common opening defensive response from Black.} 2. d4 {Still in book.} exd4 {Book move.} 3. Qxd4 {White recaptures and is still in book.} Nc6 {Black attacks Queen and is still in book.} 4. Qd5 {This is where it appears to depart from book moves.  An apparent blunder by White to place the Queen in such a lame position.} Nf6 {Black develops and attacks the Queen.} 5. Qf5 {Another apparently terrible move, placing the Queen in a lame position.} d5 {This time Black not only places the White Queen under attack but also places White's developed Pawn under double attack.} 6. Qg5 {Now the developed Pawn is undefended.} dxe4 {Captured and now Black's undeveloped Queen is the only piece on the d file (column).  Additionally, White's only developed piece is the Queen.} 7. Bb5 {Black's Queenside Knight is pinned.} Bd7 {unpinned.} 8. Qh4 {and yet another Queen move!  with only two developed White pieces.  probably a terrible move.} Nd4 {White's Bishop is placed under double attack and the Pawn on c2 is threatened.} 9. Nc3 {White's developed Bishop is now defended but he's under double attack and the c-file pawn is still vulnerable.  Better might've been Bishop takes Bishop for a check.} Nxc2+ {Pawn captured, check, Rook in danger.} 10. Kd1 {out of check but vulnerable to another check via movement of Black's developed Bishop.} Bxb5+ {Bishop takes Bishop and White's King is in check.  Black is offering a Knight and giving up taking White's a-file Rook.} 11. Kxc2 {White captures the Knight instead of blocking check and now it's a King chase.} Qd3+ {White has only one move.} 12. Kb3 {Black has different options here, including sacrificing a Bishop with B-a4+, forcing the King onto the fourth rank and soon into checkmate.} Bc4+ {Instead Black is keeping the Bishop.} 13. Ka4 {White's only move.  Now Black cannot move Q-c4+ because the developed Bishop wasn't sacrificed.} Qd7+ {Black's Queen is nonetheless moved to check White and now White is one move away from checkmate.} 14. Ka5 {White moves the King rather than blocking the check.} b6# {After 14 White moves, 5 of them a Queen move, 5 of them a King move, and only 4 other moves, White is checkmated on the 5th rank by the first move of one of Black's Pawns.  The Pawn is double protected and Black's Queen and two Bishops, one of them undeveloped, cover the other squares adjacent to the White King.}
