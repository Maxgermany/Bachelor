[Opening "Caro-Kann (B10), Hillbilly attack"]

1. e4 c6 {A new opening for me: the Caro-Kann Defense.} 2. Bc4 {?! Puts the bishop where blacks logical next move attacks it.} d5 3. exd5 {Better than 3. Bb3 dxe5.} cxd5 4. Bb5+ Nc6 5. Nc3 d4 {This seems Alekhine Defense-like.  I might play 6...Be6 and 7...a6.} 6. Ne4 e5 {I guess I decided against the plan in the previous note and supported my d pawn.} 7. d3 {Opening the line for his bishop.  We both miss the tactic Qa5 , winning the bishop.} Nf6 {The white knight seems to be in a good position, so I would like the option to remove it.  This move seems better than f5, leading to something like 8. Bxc6  bxc6 9. Qh5  g6, where the black kingside pawns seem weak.} 8. Qf3 Bg4 {? I thought I was punishing the queen's overaggressive move and that Qg3 was the queen's only safe move.  However I missed black's tactic.} 9. Nxf6+ {Winning the bishop.} Qxf6 {Seems better than gxf6.} 10. Qxg4 Bb4+ {The situation I was hoping for if white had played 9. Qg3 is impossible, but there are some tactical possibilities here, although they do not play out.} 11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 12. Kxd2 O-O {Escaping the pin.} 13. Nh3 {Protecting f2.} Rac8 {Protects the knight and prepares Nb4.} 14. Ng5 {We both miss Qxf2 .} Qh6 {Pinning the knight.} 15. Rae1 {Attacking e5.  Better was Bc4, pinning the f pawn so the knight can escape.} f6 {Winning the knight.} 16. Qe6+ Kh8 {Not 16...Rf7? 17. Qxc8 } 17. h4 {Better was f4, avoiding my 19th move.} fxg5 18. Qxh6 {Any other move would have allowed a discovered check with gxh4 .} gxh6 19. hxg5 Rxf2+ {White could prevent this after 19...hxg5, so I use this zwischenzug first.} 20. Re2 Rxe2+ 21. Kxe2 hxg5 22. Bc4 Nb4 {Attacking c2 and skewering the bishop.} 23. c3 {For a minute I thought my knight had been too aggressive, but it can continue forward.} Nc2 {Better than leaving a pawn on e5 after 23...dxc3 24. bxc3.  The d4 pawn can support the knight at e3.  A nice continuation for black would be something like 24. cxd4 exd4 25. Kd2 Ne3 26. Be6 Rc2  27. Ke1 Rc1 , winning the rook, although there's no reason white shouldn't do something like 25. Bb3.} 24. cxd4 exd4 25. Be6 Re8 {Pins the bishop; wins a pawn after 26. Kd2/Kd1 Rxe6 27. Kxc2 Re2 , followed by 28...Rxg2.  26. Rh6 fails to save the bishop after 26...Kg7.} 26. Rh6 {Loses the bishop, better was Kd2 or Kd1 as mentioned in the previous note.} Kg7 27. Rh5 Rxe6+ 28. Kd1 {This prevents something like Rxg2  in the future, for a continuation like 28. Kd2 Nb4 29. Rxg5  Rg6 30. Rb5 Nxa2 31. Rxb7  Kh6 32. Rxa7 Rxg2  33. Kd1 Rxb2.} Ne3+ {Pinning the king and pawn.} 29. Kd2 Kg6 {Forcing the rook away first so I can gain a pawn.  30. Rh2? does not defend the pawn due to 30...Nf1 .} 30. g4 {That doesn't save the pawn or protect the rook for long.} Nxg4 31. Rh1 h5 32. Rc1 h4 33. Rc4 Ne5 {Now if 34. Rxd4?, Nf3  wins the exchange for an easy endgame.} 34. Rc7 Rb6 35. b3 h3 {Forcing the rook to stop the pawn.} 36. Rc1 g4 {I'm in no rush, so I make sure I can't blunder away the h pawn.} 37. Rh1 Kg5 38. Ke2 {The rook can't stop the g and h pawns by itself (e.g. if white wasted moves 38...Kh4 39...g3 40...g2 41. Rg1 Kg3 42...h2 wins), so the king needs to help.  Unfortunately for white this allows black to capture the rest of his pawns, and with an active rook promotion still is easy.} Kh4 39. Kf1 g3 {This seems to be the quickest way to win: If 40. Kg1 g2 41. Rh2 Kg3, the rook can reach the first rank in two moves, winning.  Otherwise a pawn promotes as mentioned in the previous note.} 40. Kg1 g2 41. Rh2 Kg3 {Now white has only pawn moves or losing his rook.} 42. a4 Rxb3 {Nf3 would have mated immediately.} 43. a5 Rb1# {0-1}
