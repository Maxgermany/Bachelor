1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. Nf3 Bb4 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Qd6 7. Bb5+ c6 8. Ba4 Ne4 9. Bb2 b5 10. Bb3 a5 11. Nd2 Nd7 12. Nxe4 dxe4 13. Qg4 {Good move on my part - Black will either lose the g-pawn or the pawn on e4} Nf6 14. Qxg7 {Taking the g-pawn} Rg8 15. Qxf6 {Taking the unprotected knight - not a smart move for Black} Rg6 16. Qh8+ Ke7 17. Qxh7 Rxg2 18. Qh4+ Ke8 19. Qxe4 {Taking the e4 pawn} Rg6 {Black moves his rook out - not sure why} 20. c4 {Opening a path for my Bishops} bxc4 {If I were Black, I would have done pawn to b4 instead, then when I used my a-column pawn to capture, use the Queen to take the white pawn, to avoid opening a path for white to take the rook and giving my queen some leverage in White's territory. Instead, from this move on, my Bishops get free reign of the board (basically). } 21. Bxc4 {Recapturing the pawn} Rb8 22. Bc3 Qe7 23. Bxa5 {Taking the unprotected pawn and putting my bishop in an advantageous position. It wasn't until just a minute ago (literally, as I'm typing this) that I realized that so far, Black's WSB has not moved at all - at this point, if I were black, I would do Bb7.} Qf6 {Black does not see my next move, thinking only about perhaps taking my f pawn and checking me. Not a good strategy, as there are no pieces that can immediately support the queen and it will take at least two moves (one Rg2 and the next Qxf2+) to accomplish that. } 24. Qxc6+ {My queen goes in for the kill.} Bd7 25. Qd6 {Threatening the rook on b8. If I were Black, I would do Qd8 to try and protect myself from checkmate} Rg2 {Black is still focused on my f pawn, apparently.} 26. Qxb8+ {Taking the rook and threatening mate. Black has basically three moves at this point: a useless interposition by his WSB, interposing with his queen (and mate on the next move) or moving his king to e7 and possibly escaping mate, although if he had done that, I would have done Qd8+, forcing him to move his king to d6 and letting me take the queen, at which point, huge advantage for me. Black resigns here.}
