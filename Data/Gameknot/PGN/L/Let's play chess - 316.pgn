[Opening "Scandinavian (B01), Anderssen counter-attack"]

1. e4 d5 {This is my favorite defense.  It isn't because I think it is better than other defenses, it's because for so many years people bashed it as being unsound.  Tell that to Karpov who got pounded by Larsen with it.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 {There are three distinct queen moves here.  I believe all three have their good/bad points.} Qa5 4. d4 e5 {This is Anderssen's Counter Attack.  It was discarded long ago as being trash but chess players can be snobs and reject things without deep examination.} 5. Bc4 {I only know of seven lines in this position with 5. Nf3 being considered strongest.} Bb4 {5...Nc6 is the most direct move and is playable here.  } 6. Qe2 {I thought White might consider 6. Nge2 here.  On 6. Qd3, Nc6  7. Nge2, Nge7  8. 0-0 Bf5 Black has a good game.  If 6. Bd2 then 6...Nc6 is good, e.g., 7. d5, Nd4  8. Nge2, Nf6  9. Nxd4, exd4  10 Ne2, Ne4! with excellent prospects for Black.} Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 Qxc3+ 8. Bd2 Qxa1+ {Unfortunately, my analysis is going to end here because the rest is just mopping up.  I look forward to gaining a much higher GameKnot rating so that I can try my ideas out on stronger opponents.}
