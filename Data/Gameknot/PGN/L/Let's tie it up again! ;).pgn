1. e4 {King's Pawn opening.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ c6 4. Bc4 {Game DB gave this move high marks.  Black should think twice before attacking the Bishop with d3 as it leaves e5 dangling in front of my Knight.} Be6 {Black offers a trade.} 5. d3 {If Black attacks with his pawn the exchange should favor me.  If he trades Bishops, my queen will be uncovered for action.} d5 {Here we go...} 6. exd5 {6... cxd5} cxd5 {So far so good...} 7. Bb5+ Nc6 {Good response, but... } 8. Bxc6+ {I'm feeling aggressive today.} bxc6 {Black's Queen side is slightly weakened, but all in all, his defences are solid and he has more land than I...  I didn't get the advantage I hoped.} 9. Nxe5 {I'd say we're roughly even now, but I need to develop some power pieces.} d4 10. Nxc6 {Too tempting to resist...} Qd5 {I like the looks of this. Black's Queen side is pretty much demolished, but we are both under developed.} 11. Qf3 {Will he trade ladies?} Rc8 {Interesting.  Black offers me the a7 Pawn...  What will it cost me?  His Rook will take c2!  Then it would be clobbering time!  (For him, not me!) And to make it worse, my undeveloped Knight would be trapped!  } 12. Qxd5 {So I'll trade Queens...} Bxd5 13. Nxd4 {And save my Knight (With a snack), but...} Bxg2 {with cost.  I was thinking to castle King side...} 14. Rg1 {But alas!  It is not to be.} Bh3 {Hmm...  Rg3?} 15. Nc3 {No, his Bishop is no immediate threat, and Rg3 should repel him when I desire, so I think I'll develop my Knight. } Bb4 {Expected.} 16. Bd2 {Countered.} Nf6 {? Is this his second blunder?  } 17. Rxg7 {Allowing me to munch on g7?} h5 {Preparing to attack my Rook with his Rook by moving the Pawn out of harms way?  No, Black's Knight defends both g8 and h7.} 18. O-O-O {If needed, my Rook can retreat to the safety g1 after I castle.} Ng4 {And Black blocks the e file.  My first reaction when I saw this move was #@%, as his Knight forks both undefended Pawns, but when I saw that 19... Nxh2, 20. Rh1 would cost black his Knight or Bishop, I simply attacked with the f Pawn.} 19. f3 {Like so.} Ne5 {I think 4u has lost his focus.  I can now retreat my Rook, } 20. Rg3 {attacking his Bishop,} Bd7 {Then } 21. Re1 {Pin his Knight.  Will he move his King, or defend his Knight?} f6 {?  A mistake I think, as} 22. f4 {Black's Knight is surely mine!  Wake up nv!} h4 {Nuisance!} 23. Rgg1 Bc5 {Ouch!  My bad!  The old x-ray attack!} 24. fxe5 {Black's Knight is still mine, but at a cost.  Still, I think this could work to my favor...} Bxd4 25. exf6+ {A nice reveled check!} Kf7 {And now for the icing on the cake,} 26. Re7+ {No!  I moved the wrong Rook!  Rg7  Kxf6, RxB is not going to happen now.  Arrogance is a dangerous companion!} Kxf6 {I may still be able to snag Black's undefended light Bishop, but I must be careful!  His dark Bishop has my Rook in his sights!} 27. Nd5+ {Check!  Which also defends my e7 Rook.} Kf5 28. Rf1+ {Finally free from that #@$% Bishop!} Kg6 29. Rxd7 {Lunch!  But not free.  I expect 4u to move a Rook to d8, attacking both Rook and Knight.} Be5 {Unexpected!  Attacks my undefended Pawn...} 30. Ne7+ {And leaves Black vulnerable to a Knight fork!  I think my opponent is distracted...} Kg7 {He is distracted!  His Rook is now mine for free...} 31. Nxc8+ {with a reveled check...  And Black resigns. (I would have too.)}
