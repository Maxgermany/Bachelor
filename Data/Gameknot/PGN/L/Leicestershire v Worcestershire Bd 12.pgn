1. e4 {Once more into the fray} g6 {The so-called Modern Defence, actually at least 60 years old.} 2. d4 {White takes the centre.} Bg7 {Black completes the fianchetto} 3. Nc3 {White rules out transposing into the King's Indian Defence} d6 {Black does the usual 3rd move, going into the Pircâ€“Robatsch Defence} 4. Bc4 {I have a plan of attack against the fiachetto position} Nf6 {The usual move for Black. I want to play Bc1-e3, but I don't want it hit by Ng4, so I play...} 5. f3 {This move also rules out Nf6xe4 followed by d5 regaining the piece} O-O {The usual 5th move. Although we had arrived 15 minutes late, I was moving almost instantly, while he was taking a long time over his moves. I think he was afraid of an attack against his king.} 6. Be3 {I continue with my plan} Nc6 {He prepares to strike in the centre.} 7. Nge2 {I develop} e5 {He hits in the centre} 8. Qd2 {I leave the way opne for castling on either side.} exd4 {He takes} 9. Nxd4 {I take} Nxd4 {He takes again} 10. Bxd4 {Of course, not 10. Qxd4? Ng4! with advantage to Black.} Be6 {He continues with his policy of exchanging.} 11. Be2 {This time I don't go along with it.} a6 {As played in Mandak, Miroslav (2089) vs. Doucha, Ludvig (2107)  2002.11.09, which continued 12. O-O d5 13. exd5 Nxd5 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 and agreed draw on move 47. I play something else. } 12. g4 {An aggressive thrust, but perhaps not the best, what do you think dear reader? He now had a long think and played} c5 {and he offered a draw. I had a long time and decided to play on. Afterwards the top chess program Fritz agreed....} 13. Bf2 {He the bishop stops checks on h4, although Be3 is just as good, according to Fritz.} b5 {b5 is an excellent move by him. Pause now, what do you think is the best move for white?} 14. g5 {Fritz doesn't like that move. It claims that a3 is the only move to preserve the very small edge that White has. Is that what you would have played. It is interesting that in a couple of games this season, I have got into trouble by not playing aggressively enough, but in this game the errors I make are being over-aggressive and not castling sooner. Now I was hoping for him to move his knight, so I can answer b4 with Nd5 and if he takes, I take back with the queen, leaving his d pawn weak, backward on a semi-open file. But of course he plays.....} b4 {And he is ok. Fritz now thinks Nd1 is best - although still good for black, but to me it looked hopeless to have the knight there - for the time being it has to stay on d1 protecting b2, so presumably I would have to play c3 or c4 something to release it.} 15. gxf6 {So I take} bxc3 {He takes back} 16. Qxc3 {I take and offer a draw, which he accepts. I was looking at Bxf6 17. Qa3 Qb6 18. O-O-O Rfb8 19. c3 Ra7 and thinking I have to play Be3, so that I can play Rd2 without worrying about him playing Bf6-g5 winning. However Fritz pointed out Bxf6 17. Qa3 Bh4! with advantage to Black.
