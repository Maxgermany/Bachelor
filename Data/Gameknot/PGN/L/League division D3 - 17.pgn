1. Nf3 Nf6 {Developing King-side Knight, looking to attack f7, g7 and h7, and really put early pressure on the Black King} 2. d4 e6 3. Bg5 Be7 4. Bxf6 {A mistake I make all too often in the game, I've since learnt taking pieces simply for "reducing their" pieces is useless. However, White was planning on using the white squared bishop and Queen to launch his attack, and the Knight on f6, would have been more in the way than the Black bishop, or so i decided.} Bxf6 5. e3 O-O {Black castles first, this is what I wanted, to help launch my attack, and send the Black King further to the corner of the board} 6. h4 {Saw the doubled threat of Bf6 and Qd1 so decide to make sure that doesnt progress} d5 7. c4 dxc4 {dxc4 i find is a common move in that position, but only means positional advantage, and more developing for White} 8. Bxc4 Nc6 9. Nc3 h6 10. d5 Ne5 {Was aware of the dangers of that Knight, 15 moves on when it has an outpost on any one of g4, f3, d3, even f2 was possible later on, so hence i removed it..} 11. Nxe5 Bxe5 12. f4 {Pretty much assumed that Bf6 wouldnt be played by Black, it loses tempo for Black and allows White to play Ne4, and really take control of the centre} Bxc3+ {Not surprisingly..} 13. bxc3 Bd7 14. g4 {This move was to set up 15.g5 or to stop the Black Queen advancing, aka Qf6, then g5, but that wouldnt stop Qc3 and forking the Rook} Qf6 15. Qd4 {That was really probably the best defense I could find, Rc3 could have been played, but then that was allowing the Queen to comfortably sit on f6, and if Qc3 was played, exd5 opens up a threat on the White Bishop whose sensible move is to recapture, then Black plays Bxg4, and down goes another pawn.} e5 {This plan to attack, well h7, now the pawn has been moved to h6, is starting to go not as planned, once I move my Queen to e4, with hope of playing Bd3 and Qh7 as my consecutive moves, it allows exf4 opening the fork but also Qb6, a dangerous threat to the rook if I dont castle, so I decide to continue my attack on the Queen, nullifying the threat on the g4 pawn and, with better development in the centre (i thought) have hopefully an advantage} 16. Qxe5 Qxe5 {Black decides to make the Queen exchange and now for a new gameplan} 17. fxe5 Bxg4 {I didnt realise in my analysis that I would lose g4, a mistake I made, and bothered me, material was even, but I had planned my moves to save that pawn, because g5, hxg5 hxg5 opens up my Rooks h-file, if Black played h5, instead of hxf4, the pawn would still be out of reach of Blacks White-Squared Bishop} 18. Rb1 {I try to consolidate} b6 {He isnt having that!} 19. Be2 {I figure my pawns are better placed so time to remove the bishops, (ideally not wanting to be left with the oppenents white-squared bishop in the endgame)} Bxe2 20. Kxe2 Rfe8 {Also not in my analysis, i end up losing yet another pawn because of this..} 21. e6 fxe6 22. dxe6 Rxe6 {And now continues a long battle with Black, using both rooks on the double file, attempting to secure more of my pawns going into the endgame} 23. Rbd1 Rae8 24. Rd3 {Could have been in trouble if my rook wasnt on the d or f file...} Re6e4 {Threatens h4, some people might say I didnt need to play h5, covered by the Rook, but the R on h1, isnt going to stay there forever, and the line Re4 is on, played a major part in most of the anaylsis i did} 25. h5 Ra4 {Threathens a2} 26. Rd2 {But I cant let him have it} Ra3 {tries c3} 27. Rc1 {Sorry..} Kf7 28. Rd7+ {Kf7 wasnt a smart move, giving away a pawn (i was too) but at least I'm gaining tempo, ever since he was threatening all my pawns, and I was defending, the Rooks are useless to me as weapons whilst they are defending all my pawns, so this i saw as a worthwhile check} Re7 {Another mistake by me, in not seeing this in my analyis, had I have seen this i probably wouldnt have chosen it. Other than Rd2 (which puts me in the defensive again) I have no choise but to go down another pawn..} 29. Rcd1 Rxa2+ 30. Kf3 {At least i protected e3, right? Well, now my Rooks werent solely defending pieces, I was thinking of playing a more attacking role with them, and took my eyes off the R on e2 for awhle, and henceforth, gave up  a 6th pawn} Rh2 {As follows} 31. Rd1d5 {Not sure as to the thinking behind this, Rf5+ was probably the idea, but still horribly wrong move to make..} Rh3+ {Oops!} 32. Kf4 Rhxe3 {There we have it. Now down 3 points in material, and although i maintained both rooks, 3 pawns down doesnt look convincing..} 33. Rxe7+ {Two rooks, especially when on the same file, are very dangerous, and he cant be as danerous with one, so i decided to make the exchange..} Rxe7 34. Rf5+ {That was the move I planned earlier, which maybe should have waited till before Rxe7+} Ke6 35. Kg4 Rf7 {Black knows for sure now if he can remove my remaining rook from the game he has won, there is no way back for White trying to defend a 5-2 pawn advantage with just a King} 36. Rb5 {As such, I cant give that Rook up} Rf6 37. Rb4 g6 38. Rc4 {In my position as black, I would have played firstly gxh4, to which I was white, would have played, Kxh4, or secondly, c5. I can see Blacks idea, that g5, plays to Blacks advantage in Rf4+ and White will lose without his Rook, so he isnt going to stick around to see Rf4+ happen, and therefore take himself off the line and out of the game almost (this is where i said having the pawn on h5 instead of h4 would be better) but if the pawn was on h4, then 38...g5 39. hxg4 hxg4 40. Kxg4, and maybe it was better after all, but oh well} g5 39. Rxc7 a5 {Dont see why Black didnt choose to play Rf4+ here instead of 40...Rf4+, Black could have checked the King, forced him to move then played a5 if he wanted to. Anyway} 40. c4 {White has almost given up hope..} Rf4+ {Now he comes..} 41. Kh3 Kd6 {Not a smart move by black, forcing the Rook to move yes, but wouldnt moving to f5, be more of a threat??} 42. Rh7 {Black cant defend that pawn now, so into check goes the White King} Rh4+ 43. Kg3 {Fortunately Rooks are left, not Queens, or this would be even worse for White, as it stands White isnt looking too great} Rxh5 {Black captures h5, and also protects h6, a job well done by the Rook, so what is White to do?} 44. Kg4 {Threaten the Rook, does he really have any other choice?} Rh4+ 45. Kf5 {White attempts to send his King to help the Rook} Rf4+ 46. Kg6 Rf8 {Cannot say why Rf8 was played, in my opinion, Rh4 would have worked just as well, the h pawn is covering the g pawn from being captured, and that would leave the Black King alone, with two pawns, against the lone c pawn} 47. Rxh6 {Rook captures back a pawn, and Black isnt playing fantastic here, could have close the game out a long time ago. Kc5, should have been played long before, as it stands though, the Rook now cant defend it, so now is a good a time as any for Black} Kc5 48. Kxg5 {And now the margin is just one point in material, Rf8, completely removed the Rook from any defense it had, and gave away the two pawns, and the game is in the balance. Here Rc8 is played, but I think b5, would have been better played first..} Rc8 49. Kf4 b5 50. cxb5 {Might as well take it, doesnt look like having a bright future anyway} Kxb5 51. Rh5+ {A smart move for White, but I expected Black to play Rc5. Although has managed to somehow redice the 3 pawn deficit to just one, removing the Rooks, would still leave the advantage to Black, and with the Black king blocking the White King from the a pawns path, all would be lost for White..} Kb4 52. Ke3 a4 53. Kd3 Kb3 54. Rb5+ {White finally breaks through after bringing his King down as close as Black will let him, and I thought here I had a chance?} Ka2 55. Ra5 {Not sure if this was the right move, at the time. I now see Rb4 followed by Rc4, could have forced Rxc4 Kxc4, but then the White King is still blocked, and that of course would only play out if Rb3 didnt result in Black playing a3, and leaving the situation still hopeless for white with 55. Rb4 Ka3 56. Rc3 Kb3, which gives the pawn right of passage there...so Ra5 probably was the best move..} a3 56. Ra4 Kb3 57. Ra6 {I dont think White can win, but maybe he might make a mistake..} Rc3+ 58. Kd2 Kb2 59. Rb6+ {White looks for something, anything..} Rb3 {I deliberated here for a long time...if Rc6 was played, there may be a chance (depending on black) of White making Rc2, in which case if Black didnt play Rc3 after white plays Rc6, then maybe he'd have a chance. For a long time now though, White has been waiting for Black to give him an oppertunity, and doesnt give him one. Going through the lines after the game, Black could obviously still have won, even if White gets his rook to Rc2 by something like 60. Rc6 Rb4 61. Rc2 Kb3 62. Kc1, and the Black King to open his rook up can only move to a4. This allows the White Rook to move to a2, and perhaps force a draw, but that is all only by playing Blacks moves for him. As it was, I was overthinking and I played probably the worst move i could} 60. Rxb3+ {Which was this one...Rxb3} Kxb3 {Exchange} 61. Kc1 a2 {Pawn advance...I resigned here because after he earns a Queen, or rather, well and truly before this point, I had lost..  Please comment and give me advice, I didnt play to play, I got caught up in captures and the like, and tried to fight my way back, but was perhaps not wary enough of how important pawns can be in the endgame. Thanks everyone  (I apologise for lack of spelling or grammar, I will correct it at a later date if any is incorrect, its currently 2:09 am here)}
